<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is commonly expected that the Author or Editor of every work would furni&s;h the public with &s;ome account of the performance in the Preface; this will not be done here at length, as the work is before you and will an&s;wer for it&s;elf. It may be remarked that the Preface would be a &s;uitable place to give a &s;ketch of the lives of the two gentlemen, who&s;e trials are here publi&s;hed, to this it can be an&s;wered that the Editor never &s;aw Mr. <HI>Hopkin&s;on,</HI> now decea&s;ed; and it would be very improper to write any thing re|&s;pecting the life of the other gentleman, who is yet on the &s;tage: But the works of Mr. <HI>Hopkin&s;on</HI> are publi&s;hed, and his character is well known to be not inferior to any, and having very few of equal merit among the literati of the pre&s;ent century. By the pre&s;ent publication it will al&s;o appear, that <HI>he,</HI> like other people, had political enemies, who were equal|ly di&s;appointed at his acquittal in the year <HI>1780,</HI> as others have &s;ince been at the acquittal of Mr. <HI>Ni|chol&s;on</HI> in the year <HI>1794.</HI></P>
<P>The documents herein publi&s;hed have been regular|ly compared with authentic copies laid before the Se|nate, who&s;e permi&s;&s;ion to copy them the Editor had obtained during the interval from the 23d of March to the adjournment in April.</P>
<P>If any errors have crept into the work, let the reader be a&s;&s;ured that great pains have been taken to prevent them, and that a work of this &s;ize and
<PB N="vi" REF="027132_0006_0FD34E2DA2689418">
con&s;equence cannot fail of being attended with many difficulties; that this was a new field of argument, and that every error communicated to the Editor from any of the Speakers, or from tho&s;e concerned &s;hall be duly attended to, and rectified in the next edition.</P>
<P>From the difference in the length of the work in the two trials, the latter of which the Editor at|tended throughout, and took down in &s;hort hand; and the former be only collected and compiled from papers, &s;ome in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of private gentlemen, and others with the public, the reader will judge how nece&s;&s;ary this work is to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a com|plete hi&s;tory of the State-Trials of the Commonwealth of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> before the period pa&s;&s;es when it can only be gathered from partial writers on one &s;ide or the other: As an evidence of the importance of this work, the Editor will be excu&s;ed for introducing the following judicious report to the Senate of <HI>Penn&s;yl|&s;ylvania,</HI> by their committee a few days before the adjournment in April <HI>1794.</HI></P>
<P>"The committee to whom was referred the peti|tion of <HI>Edmund Hogan,</HI> report&mdash;</P>
<P>"That in their opinion the work in which the pe|titioner is engaged is entitled to encouragement from the Legi&s;lature, to hand down to po&s;terity the doings of their forefathers, and to re&s;cue from oblivion the mo&s;t important tran&s;actions of the day in which we live, unembarra&s;&s;ed with quotations from ob&s;olete, Briti&s;h or exotic &s;tatutes and corrupt precedents, will certainly command the &s;miles of every enlighten|ed Legi&s;lator, of every Patriot, and is worthy the efforts of genius. In order therefore to further the de&s;igns of the petitioner, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the execution of his laudable undertaking, and to promote the dif|fu&s;ion of u&s;eful and important knowledge throughout

<P>It is a&s;&s;erted in a note, at the bottom of page <HI>209,</HI> that the oral te&s;timony given in the hou&s;e, when the articles of impeachment were brought forward again&s;t Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> was not committed to writing; part of this te&s;timony appearing in pages <HI>185</HI> and <HI>188,</HI> the Editor thinks it proper to &s;tate, how that part of it had been pre&s;erved, altho' unknown to the managers: &mdash;He was employed by the proprietor of the <HI>Mail,</HI> a daily paper then publi&s;hed in the city, to collect intel|ligence, and for that purpo&s;e had been permitted, as many others had been before and &s;ince, to fit in a con|venient place in&s;ide the bar of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;en|tatives, where he collected the te&s;timony alluded to in Sept. <HI>1793.</HI> About the &s;ame time he entertained &s;ome notions of publi&s;hing the following trial, in which he was encouraged by a number of re&s;pectable &s;ub&s;cribers.

<P>Mr. <HI>M. Clark&s;on,</HI> &s;worn in &s;upport of the fir&s;t charge, &s;aith,</P>
<P>That &s;ome time in the month of May la&s;t, Mr. <HI>H.</HI> brought Mr. <HI>M'C.</HI> to his hou&s;e, to talk over certain di&s;|putes that happened between him the &s;aid <HI>M'C.</HI> and the officers of the Court of Admiralty. That we con|ferred fully on the &s;ubject&mdash;and &s;everal explanations took place, concerning matters mi&s;conceived between the &s;aid <HI>B. M'C.</HI> and Dep. The event was a reconci|liation that appeared cordial&mdash;the Judge te&s;tified his a&s;&s;ent to &s;aid reconciliation, having been before offend|ed with Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>M'C.</HI> went away, and the Judge remained. A conver&s;ation commenced between Dep. and Judge; Dep. mentioned that a number of &s;hares were unrepre|&s;ented, that the Judge by law might appoint agents for. That as Mr. <HI>M'C.</HI> had made con&s;iderable advances to tho&s;e people who&s;e &s;hares were unrepre&s;ented. Dep. &s;aid it would be an act of kindne&s;s to appoint <HI>M'C.</HI> &s;uch agent, as it would put it in his power to &s;ave the mo|ney advanced,&mdash;and thought it would be a good te&s;ti|mony of the afore&s;aid reconciliation being effected.
<PB N="12" REF="027132_0023_0FD34E74D16A9E40">
The Judge con&s;ented, and &s;aid he would appoint <HI>M'C.</HI> and gave me leave &s;o to inform <HI>M'C.</HI> and added, that &s;uch appointments were lucrative to the receivers&mdash;and many had been done by him (the Judge) to owners of privateers; for which he had received no recompen&s;e. That Judge apprehended that on this occa&s;ion the profits to Mr. <HI>M'C.</HI> would be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for him the &s;aid <HI>M'C.</HI> to make him the Judge, a pre&s;ent of a &s;uit of cloaths, and Judge de&s;ired Dep. would men|tion it to Mr. <HI>M'C.</HI> Dep. <HI>afterwards &s;aw M'C.</HI> and informed him, that the Judge had agreed to appoint him agent as afore&s;aid. <HI>M'C.</HI> a few days after mentioned to Dep. that in con&s;equence of the promi&s;e of the Judge, he had paid &s;ome of <HI>the</HI> &s;aid &s;eamen, who&s;e &s;hares were unrepre&s;ented, more money. Dep. made no mention of the Judge's expectations of a &s;uit of cloaths, con&s;ider|ing it too delicate a matter.</P>
<P>Judge frequently a&s;ked deponent whether he &s;aid any thing about &s;aid cloaths. Dep. evaded the an&s;wer, by &s;aying he had no convenient opportunity. Thus the matter re&s;ted for two weeks or three, when being at the Coffee-hou&s;e, I met the Judge there; he informed me that the letters of agency were made out&mdash;but that Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Meade</HI> and <HI>Fitz&s;imons</HI> were appointed in&s;tead of <HI>M'C.</HI> Dep. felt &s;urpri&s;ed at the information, and remon&s;trated with the Judge having de&s;ired me, and mentioned the promi&s;e he (the Judge) had made of ap|pointing <HI>M'C.</HI>&mdash;and that Dep. &s;aid, he had informed <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> of his intended appointment.</P>
<P>Judge &s;aid he had a right to appoint whom he plea&s;|ed&mdash;and the matter had now re&s;ted two or three weeks, and that he had never heard of the deponents applying for the &s;uit of cloaths&mdash;and thought him&s;elf neglected. Dep. felt wounded at his (the Judge'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">) conduct, and told him (the J.) that he treated him ill, and left him.</P>
<P>A few days after, Judge came to Dep. hou&s;e, and con|ver&s;ed on what had pa&s;&s;ed, and attempted to vindicate him&s;elf, and &s;aid that one thing he was mo&s;t &s;orry for,
<PB N="13" REF="027132_0024_0FD34E789B6467C8">
viz. the reque&s;t to apply for the &s;uit of cloaths, as by &s;o doing he had put him&s;elf in his the Dep. power. Dep. told him that it depended on him&s;elf, that he was not di&s;po&s;ed to do any injury to him. Dep. and Judge then parted.</P>
<P>Cro&s;s examined. Dep. rather thinks no per&s;on was pre&s;ent at the conver&s;ation about &s;uit of cloaths.</P>
<P>Judge took the Dep. to one &s;ide on the conver&s;ation at the Coffee-hou&s;e. Dep. never told <HI>M'C.</HI> of the Judge's reque&s;t. Dept. don't know that the Judge re|ceived any reward from <HI>Meade</HI> and <HI>Fitz&s;imons.</HI></P>
<P>Dept. told his brother of the Judge's reque&s;t &s;ame day and Mr. <HI>Hazard,</HI> and don't know that it is cu&s;tom|ary for the officers of the Court to receive pre&s;ents, as he never received any him&s;elf.</P>

<P><HI>William Lewis</HI> being duly affirmed, &s;aith, That &s;e|veral months before the removal of the Mar&s;hal of the Admiralty of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> from his office, Mr. <HI>Hop|kin&s;on,</HI> Judge of the &s;aid court mentioned to this affir|mant, &s;ome di&s;putes which had ari&s;en between them, and that there was one matter which perhaps the Mar|&s;hal might attempt to take advantage of, which was, that he had demanded a &s;uit of cloaths for the appoint|ment of Mr. <HI>Blair M'Clenachan,</HI> agent for the unre|pre&s;ented &s;hares of &s;eamen&mdash;that the truth of the matter was, he had propo&s;ed or intended appointing him agent; but as it was a very lucrative office, which would put large &s;ums of money into his pocket, and as he the Judge was empowered by law to appoint whom he plea&s;ed, and as the appointment was di&s;cretionary with him, he did not &s;ee why he &s;hould give Mr. <HI>M'Clena|chan</HI> &s;uch an appointment without &s;ome compliment in return; that he thought a &s;uit of cloaths but rea&s;onable, and had &s;ignified that he would appoint him, if he had a &s;uit of cloaths, that &s;ome time elap&s;ed without this being attended to, or any a&s;&s;urance given of the &s;aid &s;uit of cloaths, and therefore he had appointed others.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Sergeant</HI> &s;worn,&mdash;doth depo&s;e and &s;ay, that he knows the Judge charged the Mar&s;hal before Council for &s;elling prizes before condemnation, and without or|der, that he (Dep.) had formerly frequently applied to have orders for the &s;ale of ve&s;&s;els before condemnation and procured them&mdash;but under the pre&s;ent law, the
<PB N="17" REF="027132_0028_0FD34E7DC6E71318">
Judge refu&s;ed to give any orders but referred him to the Mar&s;hal, implying that he (Judge) would not take any notice thereof if made. That he (Dep.) did not think that &s;uch application was wicked or unju&s;t.</P>
<P>Acknowledges the paper No. 11 to be his, and under&s;tands the &s;ale of the <HI>Albion's</HI> cargo was &s;topped on that account.</P>
<P><HI>B. M'Clenachan</HI> being &s;worn in &s;upport of the fir&s;t charge, depo&s;eth and &s;aith, that he under&s;tood from Mr. <HI>M. C.</HI> that he would be appointed an Agent for certain unrepre&s;ented &s;hares, but that he never &s;oli|cited the appointment and never heard any thing re&s;|pecting a pre&s;ent of a &s;uit of cloaths. That he had advanced con&s;iderable &s;ums of money to per&s;ons own|ing unrepre&s;ented &s;hares, and &s;ettled the accounts with <HI>M.</HI> and <HI>F.</HI> the agents appointed by the Judge.</P>
<P>In &s;upport of the 2d.</P>
<P>That on the propo&s;al of Mr. <HI>Miller</HI> he con&s;ented to make a pre&s;ent of a ca&s;k of wine to the Judge afore|&s;aid.</P>
<P>That the order for delivering the ca&s;k mu&s;t have come from <HI>M. C.</HI> Judge never applied for it. That he did not intend the &s;aid wine as a bribe, or to influ|ence the Judge in an undue manner. That the Judge ever conducted him&s;elf in an upright manner to the be&s;t of Dep. knowledge&mdash;always found Judge in his duty, and thought rather too &s;evere&mdash;&s;igned a paper reque&s;t|ing the indulgence of the &s;ale of the <HI>Charlotte</HI>&mdash;no pre|&s;ent, nor bribe given for the indulgence.</P>
<P>In &s;upport of the 3d.</P>
<P>That he with others petitioned as he thinks for the &s;ale of the <HI>Charlotte</HI> before condemnation, being &s;uited for a privateer.</P>
<P><HI>Andrew Robe&s;on</HI> &s;worn &s;aith, that he is Regi&s;ter of the Court of Admiralty. That about the time that the Mar&s;hal made return that certain &s;hares of &s;eamen be|longing

to the privateer <HI>Holker</HI> were unrepre&s;ented, the Judge mentioned his de&s;ign to appoint &s;uch agents.</P>
<P>The Judge then informed the Dep. in the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation, that the Mar&s;hal &s;hortly after applied to be agent&mdash;To which the Judge objected, as he (M.) was an officer of the Court, &amp;c.&mdash;Mar&s;hal urged it on the &s;core of friend&s;hip, &amp;c. but the Judge &s;till reject|ed his the M's application. The matter laid &s;o &s;ome time, when Ma. told Judge that it would an&s;wer as well to appoint <HI>M'C.</HI> &s;uch agent. Judge con&s;ented to appoint <HI>M'C.</HI> agent. That he the &s;aid Judge, after|wards &s;eeing <HI>M'C.</HI> and he <HI>M'C.</HI> &s;aying nothing on the &s;ubject, the Judge thought for &s;everal rea&s;ons, it would be be&s;t to appoint &s;ome one el&s;e &s;uch agent&mdash;for if &s;uch things were not worth a&s;king for, they were not receiving.</P>
<P>On que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Dept. in cour&s;e of conver&s;ation heard the Judge &s;ay that <HI>Gover. Morris</HI> had declared that his <HI>(G.

<P>Dep. heard no more till the M's hearing before Coun|cil, when Mar&s;hal mentioned the &s;ub&s;tance of the fir&s;t charge. Judge told Dep. on conver&s;ing with him on the &s;ubject, that M. agreed with him that there would be no impropriety in receiving a &s;uit of cloaths for the ex|erci&s;e of a di&s;cretionary, and not a judicial power, &amp;c.&mdash; But that afterwards the Judge told the M. that <HI>M'C's</HI> deportment and &s;ituation was &s;uch that we would not appoint him the agent afore&s;aid. And he the Judge directed the M. not to mention the &s;uit of cloaths, as he now viewed it rather in a different light. The Judge told him that <HI>M'C.</HI> and <HI>Miller</HI> had in his ab&s;ence had &s;ent him (the Judge) a ca&s;k of wine, and never knew any thing of it until Mrs. <HI>Hopkin&s;on</HI> had informed him.</P>

<P>THAT finding an enquiry in&s;tituted into the con|duct of the honorable <HI>Francis Hopkin&s;on,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Judge of the Court of Admiralty, and your memoriali&s;t being of opinion, that the &s;aid Judge has been guilty of re|ceiving and exacting fees beyond what are warranted by law, from the &s;uitors in his court, he begs leave to re|pre&s;ent the &s;ame with all humility to this honorable Hou&s;e. That the Act of A&s;&s;embly of the twenty-&s;e|venth day of November, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;eventy-nine, provides "That the fees of the Judge of Admiralty, including his fee for a final decree, in the ca&s;e of a &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el under the burthen of one hundred tons, &s;hall be twenty-five bu&s;hels of wheat, and in the ca&s;e of a &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el above the burthen of one hundred tons, &s;hall be forty bu&s;hels of &s;uch wheat, payable however in money, as in the ca&s;e of the officers aforenamed." That your memoriali&s;t believes it will appear, that by law no more than five hundred pounds are due to the Judge in the ca&s;e of a ve&s;&s;el under one hundred tons, but that neverthele&s;s more than double that &s;um are continually charged and received, as the Judge's &s;ee in &s;uch ca&s;es. That your memoriali&s;t here|with tran&s;mits an authentic copy of a bill of co&s;ts, which has been &s;ome time &s;ince paid, as he is informed, and believes, in the ca&s;e of the <HI>Recovery,</HI> a &s;mall prize taken by <HI>Job Pray,</HI> in the employ of <HI>Andrew</HI> and <HI>Hugh Hodge,</HI> which was of the burthen of only eighty tons, and which was libelled by your memoriali&s;t. That the charge of <HI>thirteen hundred pounds</HI> in this ca&s;e has been complained of by your memoriali&s;t's clients, and he be|lieves to be extortionate; yet the like charges will be found in a variety of other in&s;tances, if recour&s;e be had
<PB N="28" REF="027132_0039_0FD34E6C0DC8C348">
to the bills of co&s;ts on the files of the Regi&s;ter, or in the hands of the late Mar&s;hal. That your memoriali&s;t begs leave to in&s;tance particularly in the ca&s;e or the <HI>Fame,</HI> which was al&s;o libelled by your memoriali&s;t, and lately condemned, being a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el owned by <HI>Jo&s;eph Car|&s;on</HI> and others, re-taken by the <HI>Fair American</HI> priva|teer. That if this honorable Hou&s;e &s;hould find upon enquiry, as your memoriali&s;t is induced to believe they will find, that the &s;aid Judge has been guilty of exact|ing more than his due, in the&s;e and other in&s;tances, he humbly hopes the &s;aid Judge will be called upon to an|&s;wer for the &s;ame along with the other charges exhibited again&s;t him.

<P>Mr. <HI>Hopkin&s;on</HI> put in the following an&s;wer to the a|fore&s;aid articles.</P>
<P>The an&s;wer of <HI>Francis Hopkin&s;on,</HI> Judge of the Court of Admiralty of the commonwealth of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> to the articles of impeachment exhibited again&s;t him, by the Repre&s;entatives of the Freemen of the &s;aid com|monwealth, in General A&s;&s;embly met, in their own name, and in the name of all the Freemen of the com|monwealth afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>TO the fir&s;t article the &s;aid <HI>Francis Hopkin&s;on</HI> &s;aith, that <HI>Matthew Clark&s;on,</HI> E&s;quire, late Mar&s;hal, made a
<PB N="33" REF="027132_0044_0FD34E645CA22F58">
return to him the &s;aid <HI>Francis Hopkin&s;on,</HI> as Judge of the Court of Admiralty; of certain unrepre&s;ented &s;hares in prizes taken by the privateer called the <HI>Holker,</HI> &s;oon after which the &s;aid <HI>Matthew Clark&s;on</HI> came to him the &s;aid Judge, and de&s;ired he might be appointed agent for the &s;aid unrepre&s;ented &s;hares (the &s;aid <HI>Francis Hopkin|&s;on</HI> then being in intimate friend&s;hip with the &s;aid <HI>Mat|thew Clark&s;on)</HI> but the &s;aid Judge cautiou&s;ly declined giving him the &s;aid <HI>Clark&s;on</HI> the agency reque&s;ted; ob|&s;erving to him that the offices of agent and mar&s;hal appeared to be incompatible, and reque&s;ting the &s;aid Mar&s;hal not to urge a compliance with his de&s;ire, as &s;uch an appointment would probably bring cen&s;ure on both.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s the &s;aid <HI>Matthew Clark&s;on</HI> continued to urge the appointment for two or three days, pleading the poverty of his office, declaring the profits thereof did not pay his Clerk, and alledging that the Judge ought from motives of friend&s;hip to throw any little advantage in his way that might occur from the rights of his office.</P>
<P>But the Judge &s;till declined the reque&s;t from a &s;en&s;e of impropriety and apprehen&s;ion of cen&s;ure. At length the &s;aid Mar&s;hal told the Judge that finding him &s;o very nice and difficult, he had been with Mr. <HI>Blair M'Cle|nachan,</HI> and made up matters with him; &s;o that if the Judge would give the agency to Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan,</HI> of the &s;hares in que&s;tion, it would an&s;wer his (the Mar|&s;hal's) purpo&s;e and intere&s;t ju&s;t as well.</P>
<P>The Judge, happy to be rid of the embarra&s;&s;ments he was under on the &s;core of friend&s;hip, gave the &s;aid <HI>Matthew,</HI> then Mar&s;hal, rea&s;on to believe (but no ab|&s;olute promi&s;e) that Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> &s;hould be ap|pointed agent.</P>
<P>Thus matters re&s;ted for &s;ome days, after which the Judge being at the Mar&s;hal's, and they alone in friendly conference; the Judge informed the Mar&s;hal, that a thought had ju&s;t occurred which he would in confi|dence mention, reque&s;ting his opinion thereupon, and declaring he would be bound by it. And then ob&s;erv|ed
<PB N="34" REF="027132_0045_0FD34EA884465858">
to the Mar&s;hal that he was about to throw into Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan's</HI> hands, many thou&s;and pounds, by giv|ing him the agency.</P>
<P>That Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> had wrought him much trou|ble in his office, had never &s;hewn civility of any kind, and even neglected the common compliment of his hat, when they met. That he heard much of Mr. <HI>M'Cle|nachan's</HI> politene&s;s and genero&s;ity to other per&s;ons and &s;ubmitted it, whether it would not be as proper, if Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> &s;hould make him a pre&s;ent of a &s;uit of cloaths, as well as to other per&s;ons who had not been as beneficent to him or done him &s;uch &s;ub&s;tantial favours, and finally ob&s;erved that this was a matter of delicacy and doubt. To which the Mar&s;hal replied, that in common ju&s;tice Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> ought to make &s;ome acknow|ledgment for &s;o con&s;iderable a favour&mdash;that there was no impropriety or indelicacy in the Judge's receiving &s;uch a pre&s;ent, &s;hould it be offered; the appointment to an agency not being a judicial act, but a voluntary fa|vour of the Court; no more conver&s;ation of any im|portance pa&s;&s;ed at that time on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Some days after, the Judge a&s;ked the Mar&s;hal whe|ther he had ever mentioned any thing of this affair to Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan,</HI> who replied that he had not had a favorable opportunity, and the&s;e were the only times in which the matter was touched upon; excepting that &s;ome &s;hort time after the Judge thinking on further con&s;ideration that the thing was improper, declared his better &s;entiments to the Mar&s;hal, and ab&s;olutely forbid him proceeding in it. But told the Mar&s;hal he &s;hould expect Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> would at lea&s;t a&s;k the Judge for the agency, a ceremony he never di&s;pen&s;ed with&mdash;as he thought the favour worth a&s;king for, if worth po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing; and declared he would never make the favours of his office &s;o cheap as to force them on per&s;ons who would not conde&s;cend to reque&s;t them.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> however neglecting to a&s;k for the agency in que&s;tion, the Judge frequently urged this &s;en|timent to the Mar&s;hal, which circum&s;tance the &s;aid
<PB N="35" REF="027132_0046_0FD34E03E5793F18">
Mar&s;hal hath in his depo&s;ition fal&s;ely and maliciou&s;ly applied to the &s;uit of cloaths, all ideas of which had long &s;ince been totally di&s;carded by the Judge. After this, above a fortnight pa&s;&s;ed, in all which time Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> never called upon the Judge, or gave the lea&s;t intimation that the agency would be acceptable to him. The matter was al&s;o dropped by the Mar&s;hal, who &s;eemed rather to avoid any conver&s;ation on the &s;ubject. In the interim, other rea&s;ons occurred to the Judge for not appointing Mr. <HI>M'Clenochan</HI> agent, one of which was, that he was a principal owner of the <HI>Hol|ker,</HI> and another, becau&s;e the Mar&s;hal having had great good fortune in the arrival of a valuable prize (the <HI>Need|ham)</HI> taken by one of his privateers, the Judge thought the agency was no longer an object with him: And la&s;t|ly, becau&s;e the Judge on reflection thought him&s;elf right in refu&s;ing to make the Mar&s;hal agent, but found it would be continuing the &s;ub&s;tance, only altering the form, in appointing Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> agent, knowing that it was to &s;erve the purpo&s;e and intere&s;t of the Mar|&s;hal.</P>
<P>For all the&s;e rea&s;ons, and to relieve him&s;elf at once from &s;urrounding difficulties, he finally gave the agency to Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Meade</HI> and <HI>Fitz&s;imons.</HI></P>
<P>It is not to be wondered at that Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> did not apply for the agency. As it appears &s;ince, that he was totally ignorant of the whole affair; Mr. <HI>Clark&s;on</HI> having never mentioned the matter to him at all, till after the appointment of Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Meade</HI> and <HI>Fitz&s;i|mons,</HI> having impo&s;ed a fal&s;hood on the Judge to &s;erve his own avaricious purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd charge, the &s;aid <HI>Francis Hopkin&s;on</HI> &s;aith, that the &s;hip <HI>Albion</HI> was captured in the North &s;eas by two ve&s;&s;els belonging to <HI>Robert Morris,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and o|thers, &s;ent into this port and libelled here. It appeared from her papers exhibited to the Judge that her cargo was altogether &s;alt, being eight or nine thou&s;and bu|&s;hels. A claim was al&s;o filed on behalf of her Maje&s;ty the Empre&s;s of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia;</HI> as &s;alt was &s;carce at that time,
<PB N="36" REF="027132_0047_0FD34E79723FB178">
the Judge hoping to do a public &s;ervice without injury to any individual, waited on Mr. <HI>Morris,</HI> and ob&s;erved to him, that as a claim was filed, the deci&s;ion might be dilatory, that if the cargo waited till condemnation, it would be di&s;tributed in kind, and &s;o fall into the hands of a few. That he thought &s;alt water-born, and after &s;o long a voyage might properly be con&s;idered as a pe|ri&s;hable article, and &s;old by vendue before condemna|tion under the Act of A&s;&s;embly; and that it would be very popular and a public good, if this &s;alt &s;hould be &s;old in &s;mall lots, &s;o that the hou&s;e-keepers might have an opportunity of &s;upplying them&s;elves rea&s;onably.</P>
<P>To this Mr. <HI>Morris</HI> after a day's interval con&s;ented, and a writ of &s;ale in the common form was i&s;&s;ued, and the &s;alt adverti&s;ed to be &s;old. His Excellency the Pre&s;ident &s;eeing the adverti&s;ment, took offence and wrote to the Mar&s;hal on the &s;ubject. The Judge on &s;eeing this letter waited on the Pre&s;ident and declared his motives.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident ob&s;erved that if the law was inconve|nient, methods might be taken to have it amended; but that whil&s;t it was the law, it ought to be held &s;a|cred; and that &s;alt could not be con&s;idered as a pe|ri&s;hable article within the meaning of the Act. The Judge, in deference to the Pre&s;ident's opinion, imme|diately ordered a &s;urvey; and on the report of the Sur|veyors, that the cargo was not in a peri&s;hable condition, countermanded the &s;ale, and the cargo remained un|touched 'till after condemnation.</P>
<P>And the &s;aid <HI>Francis Hopkin&s;on,</HI> by and under pro|te&s;tation, that the &s;aid articles, and the matter in the &s;ame contained are not &s;ufficient in law to maintain the afore&s;aid impeachment again&s;t him; and &s;aving to him&s;elf (and which he prayeth may be &s;aved to him) both now and at all times hereafter, all and all manner of benefit and advantage of exception to the in&s;ufficiency of the &s;aid articles in point of law: Neverthele&s;s for plea thereto he &s;aith, that he is in no wi&s;e guilty of all or any the crimes, offences or mi&s;demeanors, of what na|ture,

<P>PRESENT as before.</P>
<P>A letter from <HI>Francis Hopkin&s;on,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Judge of the Court of Admiralty &s;tiled, An An&s;wer to the third article of impeachment exhibited again&s;t him by the Hou&s;e of General A&s;&s;embly, was read, as follows, viz.</P>
<P>And the &s;aid <HI>Francis Hopkin&s;on</HI> in an&s;wer to the third article of impeachment brought again&s;t him, &s;aith:&mdash;</P>
<P>That it hath been the &s;tated cu&s;tom for the Regi&s;ter of the Court of Admiralty to draw out and deliver to the Mar&s;hal, the bills of co&s;ts, in every cau&s;e, and for the Mar&s;hal to collect and account with the Judge for the &s;um total of his the Judge's fees. That during his being in office he hath never &s;een a bill of co&s;ts in any cau&s;e whatever, or ever heard any complaints made of his fees being illegal or oppre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>That he hath never conver&s;ed on the &s;ubject with any per&s;on whatever, one in&s;tance only excepted, viz. When early in office a cau&s;e of a per&s;onal nature, where no ve&s;&s;el was concerned, coming before him, he a&s;ked the Regi&s;ter, How the fees were to be adju&s;ted in &s;uch a ca&s;e, as the Act of A&s;&s;embly &s;eemed to refer to ve&s;&s;els of certain tons burthen. To which the Re|gi&s;ter replied, That for &s;ervices not referred to in the Act, the cu&s;tom was to charge the fees according to the ancient rates, allowing 40 for one for depreciation. To which &s;y&s;tem the Judge gave his a&s;&s;ent, and acquie&s;cence as rea&s;onable and right: That the Judge never undertook to determine, what might be &s;ervices included in the Act, and what not. That as no comp|laints were ever made, he thought all was right and no injury done. That in the ca&s;e exhibited by the honorable Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly of the brig <HI>Recovery,</HI> neither the captors or any per&s;on concerned, ever ap|plied to the Judge to have the bill of co&s;ts &s;cruti|nized,
<PB N="39" REF="027132_0050_0FD34EAA171D7330">
or &s;ugge&s;ted to the Judge, or to any other per|&s;on to his knowledge, that they thought them&s;elves ag|grieved. That in the ca&s;e of the &s;aid brig <HI>Recovery,</HI> many courts were held by adjournment, and arguments had of a complex and difficult nature; that be&s;ides the pro&s;ecution of the libel by the captors, a claim was filed by <HI>Robert Morris,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> on principles entirely new, and which had nothing to do with the &s;imple capture and condemnation of the prize; and that in the &s;aid cau&s;e al&s;o two or more courts were held and depo&s;itions taken, &amp;c. on the trial of two negroes for freedom or &s;lavery, and al&s;o on agency appointed, for all which &s;ervices, the Regi&s;ter hath, as the Judge is informed and be|lieves, charged the former cu&s;tomary fees and the mo|derate exchange of 40 for one. That the Judge can and will produce undoubted te&s;timony that he hath never been covetous of his fees, or made any efforts to enlarge and encrea&s;e them beyond the bounds of ju&s;tice and moderation: On the contrary hath always &s;hewn a ready di&s;po&s;ition to &s;ave expence to parties by &s;hortening the time for condemnation in clear ca&s;es; by remitting his fees in ca&s;es of poverty and &s;mall property, and in one in&s;tance by &s;uffering eight ve&s;&s;els (of &s;mall value) to be included in one libel; for the avoiding of expence; where he might legally and right|fully have in&s;i&s;ted on eight &s;eparate libels, to his great emolument.</P>
<P>And finally that this third article of impeachment is grounded on an opinion as to the con&s;truction of an Act of A&s;&s;embly; for which the Judge is not impeachable; and that the Judge hath all probable rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that his opinion was right; as no p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;on, during the whole of his bu&s;ine&s;s in office hath ever made any com|plaint on this head.</P>
<P>And the &s;aid <HI>Francis Hopkin&s;on</HI> prays that this his an&s;wer to the third article of impeachment, may be annexed to, and incorporated with his an&s;wer to the two former articles, and to have reference to his former

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I do not recollect that he ever did.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;.</HI> Did you ever mention to the Judge, that you thought there was no impropriety in the thing, as it was not a judicial office?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I do not recollect any &s;uch idea.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;.</HI> Did you ever mention to the Judge, that the appointment of Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> as agent for the un|repre&s;ented &s;hares, would &s;erve and an&s;wer your intere&s;t <HI>and</HI> purpo&s;e as well as if you were appointed your&s;elf?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> After the Judge had agreed to appoint Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> agent, I told him, it would be relieving me of a great deal of difficulty in &s;ettling for tho&s;e &s;hares, as Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> had already advanced con|&s;iderable &s;ums to mo&s;t or all of them.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;.</HI> Did the Judge ever de&s;ire you not to mention the &s;uit of cloaths to Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan,</HI> for that he (the Judge) had upon con&s;ideration di&s;carded the idea?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Never, to my recollection; I believe not, becau&s;e the Judge &s;peaking at the Coffee-hou&s;e on the &s;ubject referred to in the depo&s;ition, &s;eemed to a&s;&s;ign his being neglected as to the &s;uit of cloaths, as one rea&s;on why he had appointed other agents.</P>

<P><HI>QUESTIONS</HI> and <HI>ANSWERS.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Robe&s;on</HI> (&s;worn.)</P>
<P>Some time early in la&s;t May, the Mar&s;hal, Mr. <HI>Clark&s;on,</HI> made a return that there were certain &s;hares for whom there were no agents, of &s;ome of the <HI>Holker's</HI> crew. Within a few days after I &s;aw the Judge, who told me the Mar&s;hal had applied to him for the agency of the&s;e &s;hares. He had told Mr. <HI>Clark&s;on</HI> he thought &s;uch appointment would be improper, as he was a prin|cipal officer of the Court, in ca&s;e of any improper conduct there was no officer to &s;erve proce&s;s, that he &s;aw the Judge again who told him that <HI>Clark&s;on</HI> had again applied to him, and urged the reque&s;t on the &s;core of friend&s;hip, that he had repeated his objections, to which <HI>Clark&s;on</HI> replied, that the &s;ituation of his accounts with <HI>B. M'C.</HI> rendered it very convenient&mdash; that the Judge declined it. That &s;ome time after he <HI>Cl:</HI> propo&s;ed to the Judge to appoint Mr. <HI>M'C.</HI> that that perhaps would an&s;wer as well. The Judge men|tioned he had given him <HI>(Clark&s;on)</HI> great expectati|ons that <HI>B. M'C.</HI> &s;hould be appointed. He afterwards mentioned that he had thought further on the que&s;tion.
<PB N="45" REF="027132_0056_0FD34EB7244DBB50">
That he had met <HI>B. M'C.</HI> frequently, that he <HI>(B. M'C.)</HI> had not mentioned the &s;ubject to him, and that Mr. <HI>M'C.</HI> had never a&s;ked the appointment, that when he met him in the &s;treet, he had taken no notice of him, not paying him the ceremony of the hat, that if the favour was worth his receiving it was worth a&s;king. That be|&s;ides it appeared to him to be improper, that an owner &s;hould be appointed, that it appeared to be the de&s;ign of the law tho&s;e agencies &s;hould be thrown into other hands. Tho&s;e conver&s;ations happened within about a fortnight. That about the 20th May Mr. <HI>Fitz&s;imons</HI> applied for the nece&s;&s;ary papers. <HI>Meade</HI> and <HI>Fitz&s;imons</HI> being appointed to the agency. That the Judge &s;oon after informed him, that he had now relieved his mind from the embarra&s;ment re&s;pecting the agency by having given it to unexceptionable per&s;ons. That altho' <HI>M'C.</HI> was offended.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Clark&s;on</HI> &s;aid,</P>
<P>That he had given to Mr. <HI>M'C.</HI> expectations of be|ing appointed agent, that he had taken &s;teps according|ly and had been made to appear little by it, that he thought it a very extra &s;tep.</P>
<P>Nothing pa&s;&s;ed between <HI>M'C.</HI> and him re&s;pecting <HI>C's</HI> applications but on <HI>B. M'C's</HI> account&mdash;That he had never heard any thing of a &s;uit of cloaths propo&s;ed un|til the charges were exhibited. When he heard what the Mar&s;hal urged, and the Judge's repre&s;entations in ju&s;tification of him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;tion by Attorney.</HI> Did the Judge ever mention to you his expectation of a &s;uit of cloaths?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Not until the evening of the day on which the Judge complained to the Council again&s;t the Mar&s;hal. There were frequent conver&s;ations concerning the mo|tives of the Judge, but I never heard any thing of the &s;uit of cloaths.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;.</HI> Did you ever hear any thing concerning a Judge's receiving pre&s;ents?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I have heard the ca&s;e of a Judge in <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Que&s;.</HI> Did the Judge approve, or di&s;approve of this?</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="027132_0057_0FD34EB985A52508"><HI>An&s;.</HI> I do not recollect the manner, but he &s;eemed to di&s;approve it.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;.</HI> When was it that this conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed, before or after this affair?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I can't recollect but believe long before; I think the Judge di&s;approved of &s;uch conduct.</P>
<P>By <HI>J. Smith.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Que&s;.</HI> Did the Judge ever inform you that he had warned and forbid the Mar&s;hal of the Court of Admi|ralty to offer the cloaths?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I never heard of the matter until the time al|ready mentioned, when it was mentioned by both par|ties.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> (&s;worn.)</P>
<P>In the beginning of the privateering my agency was verbal, but after &s;ome inconveniency ari&s;ing, written ones were taken&mdash;&s;ome were omitted, it was referred to the Judge.&mdash;Some time after the Mar&s;hal told me he thought the Judge would appoint me, and I advanced money to the people to keep them quiet&mdash;he was howe|ver informed that <HI>Meade</HI> and <HI>Fitz&s;imons</HI> were appoint|ed, that it made no difference to him, he therefore made up his accounts and &s;ent them the balance&mdash; That as to the &s;uit of cloaths he had never at that time heard of any thing of the kind from any one.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;tion by J. W.</HI> You have done a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s with the Judge, did he ever intimate to you that he expected a pre&s;ent from you?</P>

<P><HI>Que&s;tion by</HI> Mr. Inger&s;ol <HI>to</HI> Mr. G. Clark&s;on.</P>
<P>Whether you have ever heard the late Mar&s;hal &s;ay, "it would be a particular gratification to him, or do his heart good, if Mr. <HI>Hopkin&s;on</HI> were di&s;charged from his office?"</P>
<P>Objected to&mdash;argued&mdash;and put.</P>

<P>I was part owner of the <HI>Gen. Wa&s;hington,</HI> which with took the prize in que&s;tion.</P>

That it had been con&s;idered by merchants that &s;ugar and &s;alt water-born were in their nature peri&s;hable.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> admitted that the tonnage of the brigan|tine is 80 tons.</P>

<P>That in ca&s;e of parties not attending at the day, or by repeated delays, that in &s;uch ca&s;e the former &s;ees might lawfully be charged.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e of the brig <HI>Recovery,</HI> there was a claim put in, that there were adjournments in this ca&s;e, that the determination of the ca&s;e of the negroes was not determined 'till within a few days&mdash;That the fees were made out with a view to the final deci&s;ion of the ca&s;e, which would have made but little alteration whe|ther they &s;hould be condemned or acquitted.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. <HI>Fitz&s;imons,</HI> &s;worn.</HEAD>
<P>In June la&s;t Mr. <HI>Hopkin&s;on</HI> called at our counting-hou&s;e, and offered the hou&s;e of <HI>Meade</HI> and <HI>Fitz&s;imons</HI> the agency of the unrepre&s;ented &s;hares, which they agreed to accept and entered on the bu&s;ine&s;s. Afterwards applied to the Mar&s;hal for the monies due them, and had a li&s;t amounting to 26&frac12; on one ve&s;&s;el, and 23&frac12; on another. On applying to the Mar&s;hal he &s;eemed di&s;&s;atisfied, &s;aid the agency had been di&s;po&s;ed of or promi&s;ed, and mea|&s;urs taken in con&s;equence of that promi&s;e and money paid thereupon. Upon receiving this an&s;wer I informed the Judge, he &s;aid there had been &s;ome &s;uch promi&s;e, but that Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> never had applied regularly for an appointment, and on further con&s;ideration he did not think it proper to appoint one who was &s;o largely concerned in privateers, that witne&s;s offered to re&s;ign the agency, if the Judge, Mar&s;hal &amp;c. could agree a|mong them&s;elves. The Judge declined this propo&s;ition, that Mr. <HI>M'C.</HI> was improper and could not have it, that if they decline &s;ome other per&s;ons mu&s;t have it, they might therefore as well keep it. We wrote a let|ter to the Mar&s;hal, informing him that the appointment was un&s;olicited, but as it was given they would wi&s;h to proceed in the bu&s;ine&s;s. The Mar&s;hal &s;till objected&mdash; many conver&s;ations en&s;ued on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>They afterwards met at the Judge's hou&s;e on the bu|&s;ine&s;s, when a compromi&s;e was agreed to, which was, that all the monies <HI>M'C.</HI> could &s;hew he had paid on the unrepre&s;ented &s;hares &s;hould be paid to him, and the balances to be paid to Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>M.</HI> and <HI>Fitz&s;imons.</HI></P>

<P>PRESENT his exellency the Pre&s;ident, the honora|ble the Vice-Pre&s;ident, Mr. <HI>Lacey,</HI> Mr. <HI>Potter,</HI> Mr. <HI>Piper</HI> and Mr. <HI>Read.</HI></P>
<P>The Council having met agreeable to adjournment. Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> of the committee of the General A&s;&s;embly attending, and <HI>Francis Hopkin&s;on,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> al&s;o attending, the Pre&s;ident read the following DECREE.</P>
<P>IT is not u&s;ual to enter into the rea&s;ons of the judg|ment upon occa&s;ions of this kind, but the importance of the pre&s;ent pro&s;ecution makes it nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place it is ob&s;ervable, that the commi&s;&s;ion of the Judge is during good behaviour; crimes only are cau&s;es of removal&mdash;the cau&s;e is of great importance as it re&s;pects the officer, and as it comes from the Re|pre&s;entatives of the people.</P>
<P>It certainly is of the greate&s;t con&s;equence, that the &s;treams of ju&s;tice be kept pure&mdash;We act in the double capacity of Judges and Jury&mdash;It therefore became our duty, and we have examined minutely into the evi|dence&mdash;It is immaterial from what motives the pro&s;e|cution has originated, any farther than to determine how far it may affect the credibility of the witne&s;&s;es&mdash; perhaps few public pro&s;ecutions have taken their ri&s;e from pure regard to the public good, nor is it of any con&s;equence with what views the A&s;&s;embly forwarded the impeachment&mdash;Whether it is &s;upported, is the only object of our enquiry&mdash;The cau&s;e has been ably argued on both &s;ides.&mdash;</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident then read the fir&s;t article.</P>
<P>The late Mar&s;hal, Mr. <HI>Clark&s;on,</HI> &s;wears, that in a conver&s;ation he had with Mr. <HI>Hopkin&s;on,</HI> (te&s;timony of Mr. <HI>Clark&s;on</HI> read) the &s;tre&s;s of the pro&s;ecution mu&s;t depend on this te&s;timony of Mr. <HI>Clark&s;on,</HI> he him|&s;elf
<PB N="57" REF="027132_0068_0FD34E4BA6433A20">
does not &s;tate the &s;uit of cloaths as a condition, or <HI>&s;ine qua non,</HI> without which Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> was not to have the agency; &s;everal circum&s;tances &s;eem to con|firm what the Judge &s;ays, that he mentioned this mat|ter as a thought that had occurred to him, and by way of taking the opinion of his friend upon it&mdash;The Judge and Mr. <HI>Clark&s;on</HI> were at that time intimate friends&mdash; he took no notice of it, until after the Judge had com|plained again&s;t him. He was exceedingly di&s;gu&s;ted at the agency not being given to Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI>&mdash;it &s;eems &s;trange if he thought this had been made a con|dition that he made no mention of it in his complaints. Either the Mar&s;hal approved the pro&s;ecution or he did not&mdash;if he did not, why not &s;ay &s;o. If he did, why not mention it to Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan,</HI> if he thought it a con|dition not countermanded&mdash;the &s;tory of want of oppor|tunity could not have been the rea&s;on, for he mentioned the agency&mdash;it would have required but a few words more to have mentioned the condition had there been one.</P>
<P>In the next place, tho' Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> does not re|collect any countermand, yet as the Judge gave the agency to Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Meade</HI> &amp; <HI>Fitz&s;imons,</HI> not only with|out receiving any compliment, but as no hint or &s;ug|ge&s;tion was made that any &s;uch was expected, this looks like confirmatory of the repre&s;entation made by the Judge. Mr. <HI>Clark&s;on</HI> in one part of his te&s;timony is very po&s;itive, in another very cautious, &s;o far as re&s;pects the mention of the &s;uit of cloaths, he is entirely clear&mdash; as to any explanatory circum&s;tances he does not remem|ber&mdash;He is a&s;ked, did the Judge reque&s;t your opinion and advice upon the point? he does not recollect&mdash;If he is cautious in determining the complexion of the bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;urely we ought to be in founding our opinion. &mdash;Indeed we &s;hould have had very little difficulty had it not been for the te&s;timony of Mr. <HI>Lewis</HI>&mdash;but the conver&s;ation between him and the Judge happened a good while ago&mdash;a few words make a great difference&mdash; a gentleman cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to recollect with an entire exactne&s;s&mdash;we cannot but con&s;ider Mr. <HI>Lewis</HI> as

a &s;econdary witne&s;s, and therefore cannot overrule the pre&s;umption ari&s;ing in favour of the Judge upon Mr. <HI>Clark&s;on's</HI> te&s;timony from the circum&s;tances that have been mentioned&mdash;but here another que&s;tion ari&s;es, <HI>quo animo?</HI> with what mind was this done&mdash;for a great deal depends upon the intent&mdash;every killing is not murder &mdash;on a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate con&s;ideration of the character of the Judge, his general conduct in office, and all the circum&s;tances we do not think there is any proof of corruption&mdash;we could have left this charge without any further animadver&s;ion had it not been for &s;ome doc|trines advanced by the coun&s;el for the Judge, which we think proper to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations upon.&mdash;In an in&s;tant State it is of the highe&s;t importance, as we &s;aid before, that the &s;treams of ju&s;tice &s;hould be kept pure, and that the people &s;hould have a confidence in the integrity of the Judges.&mdash;Not only the taking a bribe, but even &s;oliciting it, tho' not falling perhaps &s;trictly within the definition of bribery would draw down the vengeance of the State&mdash;Whether for a Judi|cial officer or one that did not concern the admini&s;tra|tion of ju&s;tice, whether by a Judge &s;itting on the &s;eat of Ju&s;tice or this Council in their capacity as &s;uch; the office of a Vendue-Ma&s;ter is not a judicial office, but we &s;hould e&s;teem it criminal for any member of this Council to accept a compen&s;ation for his vote to an appointment in that office.&mdash;The man who can be&s;t &s;erve the public is the proper object of choice, it is enough that the office is an office of tru&s;t, whether judicial or not makes no difference&mdash;and we think the ob&s;ervation of the Attorney-General that the appointment of an agent is done by the Judge, as &s;uch, is well founded, and if we had been &s;atisfied of the fact, that the Judge had either received or &s;olicited a compen&s;ation in this con&s;ideration we &s;hould have been at no lo&s;s to have declared him guilty&mdash;and we take this opportunity to mention that we conceive it indelicate for a Judge to accept pre&s;ents from per&s;ons who frequently have bu&s;i|ne&s;s

<P>The Pre&s;ident then read the &s;econd article.</P>
<P>The Judge acknowledges that he did make a mi&s;take in the i&s;&s;uing the writ, and upon being informed of the error rectified it&mdash;to make a Judge an&s;werable for the veracity of every a&s;&s;ertion contained in the forms of proce&s;s would be very unrea&s;onable&mdash;I will not &s;ay how far a Judge may be an&s;werable in a criminal pro&s;ecution for giving a judgment contrary to a plain law; but then it mu&s;t appear that he acted wilfully wrong, and not from hone&s;t, tho' ill judged de&s;igns&mdash;but here was a point of &s;ome doubt.&mdash;The Judge &s;uppo&s;ed, and there was &s;ome colour for the idea that the law was merely <HI>directory;</HI> that he was to have recour&s;e to the interven|tion of a &s;urvey only in ca&s;e of uncertainty, and to in|form his con&s;cience&mdash;but that where he was at no lo&s;s for the very nature of the article to determine it peri&s;hable, of cour&s;e, that the &s;tep was unnece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;Salt is thus con&s;idered &s;ometimes.&mdash;If for in&s;tance, in&s;urance is made on it at &s;ea, it is treated as a peri&s;hable article.&mdash; If a mere error of judgment was to be turned into a &s;ubject for criminal pro&s;ecution, we mu&s;t, as was ob&s;er|ved by one of the learned coun&s;el for the Judge, get infallible Judges. We are therefore at no lo&s;s to pro|nounce an acquittal upon this article, more e&s;pecially as the mi&s;take was rectified as &s;oon as di&s;covered.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident then read the third article.</P>
<P>This charge has been con&s;idered by many to be more likely to endanger the Judge, and to occa&s;ion a &s;entence to his di&s;advantage, than the others.</P>
<P>The Judge an&s;wers that he took fees according to the former tables, and the practice e&s;tabli&s;hed at his com|ing into office. Now, altho' the degree of puni&s;hment ought not to make any difference, nor enter into con|&s;ideration where the matter is plainly proved, yet more caution becomes nece&s;&s;ary in proportion to the con&s;e|quences

of conviction&mdash;in this ca&s;e the penalty by the Con&s;titution is very great.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>26th &s;ection of the Con&s;titution of the &s;tate of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> e&s;tab|li&s;hed in 1776.</P>

<P>There are in almo&s;t all offices compen&s;atory as well as &s;pecific fees.&mdash;In fee laws, laws made for the regulat|ing the fees of officers, it is very difficult to enumerate all the &s;ervices. In &s;uch ca&s;es compen&s;atory fees mu&s;t be allowed, or the nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s will not be done. There is a great difference between exacting more than the &s;pecific fees, and a&s;king fees for &s;ervices where no|thing is provided.&mdash;But it is &s;aid that the law on which this charge is founded, intended to have excluded all other fees except the wheat. But every part of this law was not attended to. In a preceding paragraph it is &s;aid, that the fees of the &s;aid officers &s;hall be e&s;ti|mated and paid according to the price of good mer|chantable wheat in the manner following, that is to &s;ay, the &s;aid fees as they were regulated by law or prac|tice under the late government of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> before the fir&s;t day of July one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;eventy-&s;ix, &s;hall from and after the publication of this Act be &s;atisfied in good merchantable wheat; accounting and allowing that a bu&s;hel of &s;uch wheat, weighing at lea&s;t &s;ixty pounds, &s;old formerly in times of war and difficulty for ten Shillings. The fifth paragraph menti|ons that this former one &s;hall extend to the Judge, Re|gi&s;ter and Mar&s;hal of the Court of Admiralty.</P>
<P>It appears therefore in this very law, the principle of making a difference between &s;pecific and compen&s;atory fees was adopted&mdash;formerly by an Act of Parliament, the
<PB N="61" REF="027132_0072_0FD34ED4D99D5F80">
Judges of the court of Admiralty in the then province of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> were allowed &pound;. 15 &s;terling for every ve&s;&s;el above 100 tons, and &pound; 10 for every ve&s;&s;el below that burthen&mdash;as the &s;ame number of tons is mentioned in this Act of A&s;&s;embly, as applied to the twenty-five bu&s;hels of wheat and the forty, it &s;eems probable that this was intended in lieu of tho&s;e &s;ums. On this con|&s;truction the law is con&s;i&s;tent and complete, and the law and practice agree, and it mu&s;t appear that the &pound; 1300 taken by the Judge exceeds what he was entitled to by this mode of computation&mdash;here were three cau&s;es; the fir&s;t, libel to decide prize or no prize&mdash;that is the object of the law&mdash;then the claim by Mr. <HI>Morris</HI>&mdash;then the negroes; the&s;e are three as di&s;tinct cau&s;es as if they re|lated to different ve&s;&s;els. At this rate the fees would have amounted to &pound; 1320&mdash;but &s;uppo&s;e the matter had not &s;tood entirely on this ground, and that it had ap|peared the &pound; 1300 was a &s;um beyond what the Judge was entitled to, &s;till the charge is not, that he <HI>received</HI> too much, but that he <HI>exacted</HI> too much. We do not &s;ay, that the Judge ought not to take care of his officers &mdash;But an inadvertence of this kind would not be a ground for rendering a man infamous for life. On looking into the authorities we found they all run in this &s;tile&mdash; that the Judges exacted&mdash;that bu&s;ine&s;s was kept back and delays affected until the money was paid&mdash;&s;uppo&s;e the court wrong, they ought not to be immediately pro|&s;ecuted in a criminal way, but complaint &s;hould be made, and if they will not rectify the mi&s;take, then it will be proper to pur&s;ue in a cour&s;e of ju&s;tice&mdash;at the &s;ame time we take this opportunity to &s;ay, that the fees of the court of Admiralty have increa&s;ed lately extreme|ly, not in the time of the pre&s;ent Judge; indeed, he took things as he found them; as to the agency I do not conceive it to be the &s;pirit and meaning of the act of A&s;&s;embly, that one &s;hould be appointed to every ve&s;&s;el where there are unrepre&s;ented &s;hares&mdash;the holding of courts for mini&s;terial purpo&s;es is wrong al&s;o&mdash;this practice has taken ri&s;e within four or five years&mdash;it's

When this is done, if on complaint made, errors are not rectified, there will be a proper ground for criminal pro&s;ecution. UPON THE WHOLE, WE ARE UNANIMOUSLY OF OPINION THAT THE JUDGE OUGHT TO BE ACQUITTED UPON ALL THE THREE CHARGES.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE IMPEACHMENT, TRIAL, AND ACQUITTAL <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="day's trial proceedings">
<HEAD>On Tue&s;day the 4th day of December, in the year of our Lord, <HI>1792,</HI> and &s;ixteenth of the Independence of the United States, the Repre&s;entatives of the Freemen of the commonwealth of Penn&s;ylvania, met at the State-hou&s;e in Philadelphia, and proceeded to bu&s;ine&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 7th they appointed <HI>John Swanwick, Thomas Forre&s;t, John Chapman, John Hannum, Samuel Boyd, John Stewart, James Power, Nicholas Lutz, Jacob Eyerly, jun. George Woods, jun. John White, Abraham Hendricks, David Bradford, Albert Gallatin, James John&s;ton, Cadwallader Evans, Simon Spalding, Stacy Potts, Thomas Morton</HI> and <HI>William We&s;t,</HI> E&s;qrs. a committee to devi&s;e ways and means for the &s;upplies of the current year.</P>
<P>On the next day <HI>John Canan</HI> of <HI>Huntingdon</HI> county was added to the &s;ame committee.</P>
<P>On the 4th of January following, a letter was re|ceived from the State-Trea&s;urer, from which the follow|ing is an extract.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>"FULLY convinced in my own mind, indeed I may &s;ay from my po&s;itive knowledge, that it never was
<PB N="68" REF="027132_0076_0FD34E5069B571C8">
the intention of the Legi&s;lature to embrace within the redemption the &s;o called New-Loan certificates, which in fact never were a &s;tate debt.</P>
<P>"I was much &s;urpri&s;ed (when after ob&s;erving among the li&s;t of purcha&s;ers the name of <HI>John Nichol&s;on</HI> for 65,000 dols. all paid for in redeemable debt without any money) to &s;ee in the hands of Mr. <HI>Morris's</HI> Clerk, war|rants amounting in the whole to 63,093 35/100 dols. ex|clu&s;ive of an order on me for 4621 60/100 dols. due Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> for Dollar-money redeemed, which he pre&s;ent|ed to me as payment for &s;tock in lieu of money.</P>
<P>"The warrants were properly &s;igned and counter|&s;igned, I could not refu&s;e payment; I a&s;ked him if he knew how they originated, he &s;aid he did not, but that Mr. <HI>Morris</HI> had borrowed them that morning from Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on.</HI> Having previou&s;ly heard that one or more hawkers employed by, and even the Comptroller-General him&s;elf were running about town purcha&s;ing up New-Loans, and that they were &s;o eager in the pur|&s;uit that they had rai&s;ed the market price on them&s;elves from 20&shilling; to 21&shilling;6, I got alarmed.</P>
<P>"I &s;ent a confidential Clerk to the office of the Com|mi&s;&s;ioner of Loans, he returned and told me, that he &s;aw Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on's</HI> name in the &s;ub&s;cription book, but no &s;um annexed to it. The next morning I went down to Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> and a&s;ked him if Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> or any body el&s;e had &s;ub&s;cribed New-Loans, he an&s;wered they had, put his hand in a drawer be&s;ide him, and pulled out a bundle of New-Loans and &s;aid, the Comptroller-General &s;ub&s;cribed the&s;e and certified them to be genuine and a&s;&s;umable &s;tate debt and when he did, he left the &s;ub&s;cription blank, and &s;aid, he had more to bring.</P>
<P>"I waited on his Excellency the Governor, the Secre|tary of the commonwealth, and the Regi&s;ter-General, and an immediate &s;top was put to this, in my conception, unwarrantable career of &s;peculation, a few more war|rants of le&s;s moment than the Comptroller's having been previou&s;ly paid.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="027132_0077_0FD34EDA019DC1E0">"The honorable Legi&s;lature will pardon me for being thus lengthy, when I declare, that viewing the &s;ubject as I do, it is not only a direct violation of law, but a glaring impo&s;ition on the public.</P>
<P>"I have made &s;everal calculations; the mo&s;t mode|rate and exact of which is a nett profit to the &s;peculator of near 25 per cent. If the original entries of tho&s;e tran&s;actions are had recour&s;e to in the offices of accounts, they will &s;hew that my calculations are not exaggerated.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>"SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"I UNDERSTAND a communication from <HI>Chri&s;tian Febiger,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Trea&s;urer, was ye&s;terday read in the Le|gi&s;lature, containing reflections again&s;t me; knowing my own conduct, I feel my&s;elf perfectly &s;ecure from injury by any a&s;&s;ault he may make, and I defy and de&s;pi&s;e the attempts, he or any other enemy I have, may make again&s;t me.</P>
<P>"But without regarding the character of the man, it is proper that I &s;hould take &s;ome notice thereof, I do not wi&s;h that the motives of malice which actuate him, may operate to relax from the &s;tricte&s;t &s;crutiny into my conduct. I have this morning applied for and ju&s;t now obtained
<PB N="70" REF="027132_0078_0FD34EDFEEA865A0">
from the a&s;&s;i&s;tant clerk of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, a copy of the repre&s;entation alluded to, and was referred to the Printer, where I &s;aw the &s;tatement therein refer|red to.</P>
<P>"On examination I find nothing therein but what hath already been &s;tated in the joint report of the Regi&s;ter-General and my&s;elf on the revenues to the Governor, and which hath been heretofore laid before you, except the po&s;itive opinion (for they merit not the name of rea&s;ons) of Mr. <HI>Febiger,</HI> and &s;ome deductions therefrom which are worthy of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"The facts being &s;tated and before the Legi&s;lature, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e they needed not the aid of Mr. <HI>Febiger's</HI> opinion on the &s;ubject: If any members of the pre&s;ent Hou&s;e regret the parting with the &s;tock in the manner which was done, or the mode of the redemption of the debt, whether that, on which an intere&s;t had been pay|able half yearly, the unfunded depreciation debt, or the New-Loan debt (the two latter of which were only re|deemable through the intervention of the Loan of the United States). They will find the cau&s;es thereof in the Redemption Act of la&s;t year; and while they lament the adoption of &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem, when a more advantage|ous one was within their reach, they have al&s;o to be thankful to Congre&s;s that it was no wor&s;e, for had the Legi&s;lature of the United States thought proper to have adopted the &s;y&s;tem of loaning State debts in the extent and manner in which it was fir&s;t brought before Congre&s;s, this law would al&s;o have obligated the &s;tate to have im|mediately paid for all the old Bills of Credit emitted by the &s;tate to carry on the war, and which might have been &s;ub&s;cribed to the Loan of the Union.</P>
<P>"I fore&s;aw, the effects that bill if pa&s;&s;ed, would have when it was before the Legi&s;lature, and did not fail, to members of both Hou&s;es, to deprecate the con&s;equences of enacting it, both as it regarded the parting with &s;tock and the redemption of the debt, and al&s;o mentioned its operation with re&s;pect to the &s;everal cla&s;&s;es of debt afore&s;aid.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="027132_0079_0FD34EE260567528">"When it became a law, I availed my&s;elf of the ad|vantage it pre&s;ented as well as others, the proceedings are regular, the invitation for &s;tock was public, all might apply, and the propo&s;als by Mr. <HI>Febiger,</HI> either by him|&s;elf or his "confidential Clerk" were as welcome as any other. With re&s;pect to the debt redeemed and for whom, it al&s;o &s;tands on record, and hath been already laid be|fore you, and in my purcha&s;es or application for re|demption, I never u&s;ed the name of another, not even a "confidential Clerk," had I thought it wrong I &s;hould not have done it, and it generally argues a conviction of impropriety to u&s;e the cover of another name, but this will be remembered that <HI>my</HI> purcha&s;es were not with the public money.</P>
<P>"As to the rates at which I purcha&s;ed, they were &s;uch as afforded a profit, or I would not have made them, although as he ob&s;erves, and I &s;uppo&s;e found, a compe|tition of prices, &s;oon brought up their value in the market, but it is none of his bu&s;ine&s;s what the&s;e profits were.</P>
<P>"There are I &s;uppo&s;e mi&s;takes in the copy given me, where it reads, 365,000; 863,093 55/100 and 84,621 60/100 ari&s;|ing from his mode of prefixing his figures, the fir&s;t 8 in the three ca&s;es I pre&s;ume were not originally &s;o de|&s;igned, taking this to be the ca&s;e, or otherwi&s;e I can't &s;ee what he hath to do with the bu&s;ine&s;s; whether pay|ment of my warrant was made to Mr. <HI>Morris,</HI> my&s;elf, or any other per&s;on, to whom I cho&s;e to give an order, nor do I &s;ee why he &s;hould trouble the Legi&s;lature with the &s;tory of my giving Mr. <HI>Morris</HI> an order for the principal and intere&s;t of the Dollar-money al&s;o redeem|able.</P>
<P>"The Dollar-money however was not mine, it be|longed to a per&s;on who I believe thought him&s;elf de|graded in finding Mr. <HI>Febiger</HI> appointed to &s;ucceed him in an office he re&s;igned and had once filled.</P>
<P>"From the &s;tile of his letter one would think he had the merit, if there were any merit in it, of effecting every thing as well in the department of the Governor,
<PB N="72" REF="027132_0080_0FD34E5196895538">
as in that of the Regi&s;ter-General and Secretary of the commonwealth, and that he had put a &s;top to it; the fact is the limited period put a &s;top to further &s;ub&s;crip|tions, but tho&s;e few &s;ub&s;cribed, a&s;&s;igned and not paid, will yet be done, the parties are legally entitled thereto, but as a doubt aro&s;e with the Governor, I paid Judge <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> the ca&s;h for the amount of his &s;econd &s;ub&s;cription for which he was waiting that he might not he delayed as he was from a remote part of the State; the others were of this city and they have not &s;ince been brought for|ward till every objection be removed, but then the parties claim payment as their legal right. There re|mains but one thing more in Mr. <HI>Febiger's</HI> letter to no|tice, and that is the information from Mr. <HI>Smith's</HI> office by his confidential Clerk and him&s;elf. They are both mi&s;taken or wor&s;e, I never delayed an account at that office for &s;ub&s;cription till more &s;hould be added. The fir&s;t I took with the certificates, I made two copies of, to expedite my bu&s;ine&s;s, I left one of them with the Loan-officer, the other I got him to certify immediately, and it was transferred before I left the office, the next was a few days after and contained what I had purcha&s;ed in the interim, I &s;ent them down by a me&s;&s;enger, and by him al&s;o they were brought back without remaining for any additional certificates to be added.</P>
<P>"On enquiry of Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> I find (as I expected) that Mr. <HI>Febiger</HI> got no &s;uch information from him.</P>

<P>"AS the accounts of <HI>Chri&s;tian Febiger,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> as Trea|&s;urer hath been laid before you with his late repre&s;en|tation and they al&s;o come under my con&s;ideration, it may be proper to remark thereon, that the payments
<PB N="73" REF="027132_0081_0FD34EE400B029A8">
of intere&s;t of the New-Loan debt in bills of credit as appears in &s;aid accounts is in violation of the Act of the Legi&s;lature of the 7th April, 1791, which excepted tho&s;e bills from re-i&s;&s;ue or payment, and I was a&s;toni&s;hed on the exchange of the New-Loan certificates lately for <HI>Jo&s;eph Pennel,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to be informed by him that he had ju&s;t been paid in tho&s;e bills and was unable to get any other, and wanted to know what he could do to get the money, I ob&s;erve it is only to &s;ome per&s;ons this intere&s;t hath been &s;o paid therein.</P>
<P>"In his letter and in his accounts, he expre&s;&s;es a de|&s;ire that the Legi&s;lature would direct what is to be done with the old continental money and equivalents in his hands, they have already directed them to lie in the Trea|&s;ury, which in my opinion is the be&s;t thing that could yet be done with them. But hath he ob&s;erved the&s;e directions? no; if you look at his accounts No. 13, you will find that he hath been di&s;po&s;ing thereof of his own autho|rity, and in a former account he hath di&s;po&s;ed of far the greater part of the whole continental money on like authority, and he had even the confidence to de|clare to me that he knew, at the time he did it that it was not authorized by the Legi&s;lature. The A&s;&s;embly will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve that at the &s;ame time an offer was made the Legi&s;lature of ten per cent. advance upon what they would get if they cho&s;e to loan it to the United States. As I will never pa&s;s the&s;e &s;ums to his credit in violation of law and as in my e&s;timation, they will be of more value than he ever will be able to pay, I think it nece&s;&s;ary al&s;o to inform the Legi&s;lature that he hath neglected to give and record the &s;urety required of him in the manner directed by law. The Hou&s;e need not be informed that his former &s;ureties will not be bound for him under another appointment. There is one thing more which hath in &s;ome mea&s;ure delayed the &s;ettlement of his accounts, notwith&s;tanding the Clerk of the late Trea&s;urer (who was at fir&s;t employed by him, and &s;o cruelly treated afterwards) mu&s;t have in|formed him as well of the bu&s;ine&s;s generally, as that
<PB N="74" REF="027132_0082_0FD34E66A1B768A0">
receipts had always been taken for the intere&s;t paid or allowed on the redemption of the dollar-money, yet he neglected to do it, or if he did, to exhibit them as vouchers for the money &s;o paid, this was the more ne|ce&s;&s;ary as by an interpretation of law acted on, a great difference was made in the allowance between that emi&s;|&s;ion coming in by taxes and by other means; it is true he hath at la&s;t adopted that mea&s;ure but is was towards the clo&s;e of the time.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The following letters were written on this &s;ubject &s;oon after&mdash;</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>"SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"I HAVE read with attention the letter of the Se|cretary of the Trea&s;ury of the U. S. dated 21 Decem|ber, 1791, and the two letters of the Comptroller-Ge|neral dated 24th December, 1791, and 29th of Febru|ary, 1792, relative to the con&s;truction of the 18th &s;ec|tion of the Act of Congre&s;s making provi&s;ion for the debt of the U. S. It appears to me that the word <HI>"tho&s;e"</HI> in the enacting part of the clau&s;e can only apply to the certificates i&s;&s;ued by the State, but as that never could be the meaning of the Act of Congre&s;s, I agree that the con&s;truction given by the Secretary is the only rational one. Be that as it may, it is very certain that neither the New-Loan certificates of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> remaining in circulation, nor the Continental certifi|cates in exchange for which the&s;e New-Loans had been i&s;&s;ued, have been &s;urrendered to the U. S.&mdash;It is not le&s;s certain that the payment of intere&s;t, whether to the &s;tate or to individuals has not been &s;u&s;pended, the pre|&s;ent
<PB N="75" REF="027132_0083_0FD34E5842A59CC0">
&s;u&s;pen&s;ion to the &s;tate is but temporary, and ari&s;es merely from the exten&s;ion of the former law of Con|gre&s;s by their Act of la&s;t May, and will of cour&s;e cea&s;e on the fir&s;t of March next, (if the former objections are not revived) and of cour&s;e it mu&s;t have appeared to the &s;atisfaction of the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury that all the New-Loan certificates have been re-exchanged or redeemed. To have con&s;idered them as &s;uch is I &s;uppo&s;e, what the Comptroller means by the "equita|ble deci&s;ion" of the Secretary. It is however of im|portance to us to know what were the real grounds of that deci&s;ion, as it is po&s;&s;ible that the &s;ub&s;cription made lately in New-Loan certificates to the loan of the U. S. may affect it materially. For if the Secretary con&s;idered the whole of the New-Loan certificates as actually re-exchanged or redeemed, it mu&s;t have been, becau&s;e the &s;tate law which entitled the holders to &s;uch an exchange might been &s;uppo&s;ed to have been altogether carried into effect, &s;ince not a &s;ingle of tho&s;e certificates had been offered for &s;ub&s;cription to the loan of the U. S. But as &s;ome have been offered &s;ince the exten&s;ion of the loan took place, that circum&s;tance may induce him to alter his opinion, and indeed I cannot well under|&s;tand how he may &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf ju&s;tifiable in looking upon the whole amount as being actually re-exchanged, whil&s;t he has got it in proof, that &s;ome of them are not &s;o. Upon the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion I &s;hould be led to think that the Secretary having once declared (by his allowing the intere&s;t not to be &s;u&s;pended) that the whole amount was re-exchanged (and that upon the information of the &s;tate officer) will now look upon them in the &s;ame light and return them as not a&s;&s;umable, an opinion which I think, may al&s;o be &s;upported on different ground both from the nature of the certificates them&s;elves and from the &s;tate law of 1789, which declared the &s;tate not to be liable for the payment of the principal.</P>
<P>"However as the whole of this rea&s;oning is mo&s;tly conjectural, as the deci&s;ion of the Secretary may, under the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, lead him to &s;u&s;pend the pay|ment
<PB N="76" REF="027132_0084_0FD34E5A4F3D6DA0">
of intere&s;t to the &s;ub&s;cribers to the loan (&s;ince it was extended at lea&s;t) unle&s;s &s;ome legi&s;lative mea&s;ures can prevent that inconvenience, permit me to &s;ugge&s;t to you the propriety of procuring as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible the nece&s;&s;ary information on that &s;ubject, as I have no doubt the Hou&s;e or the committee of ways and means will &s;oon apply to you in an official manner for the &s;ame. The que&s;tions which appear to me the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;olved are the following&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">"1&s;t. What were the grounds of the deci&s;ion of the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury relative to the intended &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of intere&s;t in Feb. 1791, and what con&s;truc|tion did he give to the 18th &s;ection of the funding Act of Congre&s;s?</P>
<P N="2">"2d. Does he look now on the New-Loan certificates offered for &s;ub&s;cription to the loan of the U. S. as a&s;|&s;umable, if &s;o, upon what ground? if not, upon what grounds al&s;o? and will he return them &s;oon to the &s;ub|&s;cribers?</P>
<P N="3">"3d. Will his deci&s;ion relative to the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of intere&s;t be the &s;ame now as la&s;t winter, and if it is not, what mea&s;ures on the &s;ide of the Legi&s;lature of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> will remove the difficulties that may in his opinion now prevent the payment of intere&s;t?</P>
<P>"I have cho&s;en to communicate to you my ideas on that &s;ubject as an individual, rather than to wait for the formalities of official application taking place, in order to prevent delays; which I hope will be a &s;uf|ficient apology for this letter.</P>

<P>"IT is regretted that the pre&s;&s;ing bu&s;ine&s;s of this de|partment has not till this time permitted a reply to the que&s;tions &s;tated in Mr. <HI>Gallatin's</HI> letter of the 14th of

January, re&s;pecting the New-Loan certificates of the &s;tate of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI></P>
<P>"It has been the uniform con&s;truction of the Act making provi&s;ion for the debt of the United States, that to render any certificates receivable on the loan it was not only nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould have been i&s;&s;ued for &s;ervices or &s;upplies towards the pro&s;ecution of the late war, but al&s;o that they &s;hould at the time of being &s;ub&s;cribed be recognized by the exi&s;ting laws of the States as <HI>evidences of debts</HI> by them re&s;pectively owing.</P>
<P>"It was not, till lately under&s;tood, that any doubts were entertained whether the New-Loan certificates were in fact debts due by the &s;tate of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> in every &s;en&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to bring them within the meaning of the Act of Congre&s;s; it is certain, that no &s;uch doubts were &s;ugge&s;ted to the Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>"The commi&s;&s;ioner of loans was accordingly advi&s;|ed in June 1791 that the certificates which had been re|ceived of the State in lieu of certificates of the U. S. were receivable on loan, though at the &s;ame time he was in&s;tructed with a view to future convenience to u&s;e his endeavours with the holders to exchange them with the State.</P>
<P>"In con&s;equence of an explanation which was ren|dered nece&s;&s;ary by the provi&s;ions contained in the 18th &s;ection of the Act making provi&s;ion for the debt of the U. S. it appeared that none of the New-Loan cer|tificates of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> had been &s;ub&s;cribed to the loan of the U. S. That only the &s;um of about forty thou&s;and pounds of &s;aid certificates remained to be ex|changed, and that adequate and final arrangements had been made for exchanging the remainder by the State.</P>
<P>"This being the &s;tate of the ca&s;e it became nece&s;&s;a|ry to determine whether the payment of intere&s;t on the a&s;&s;umed debt of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> was to remain &s;u&s;pended until a &s;um in certificates of the United States, equal to the amount of New-Loan Certificates remaining un-exchanged, was &s;urrendered to the Trea&s;ury.</P>

<P>"It having been previou&s;ly arranged with the Secre|tary of the Trea&s;ury, that the ab&s;tracts with receipts a&s;&s;igned to the Commonwealth, &s;hould be &s;ufficient to authori&s;e the proper officers of the United States to i&s;&s;ue the certificates to be granted thereon, direct to the com|monwealth.

The &s;ub&s;cribing &s;tate creditors pre&s;ented a li&s;t, together with the certificates, to the Comptroller-General, who examined and certified their a&s;&s;umable and genuine quality, without de&s;cribing the kind of debt; on which certificate the officer of loans granted the party a receipt on an ab&s;tract, which ab&s;tract and receipt were generally pre&s;ented to this office, and a&s;&s;igned to the commonwealth. An examination with re&s;pect to the ca&s;ting and intere&s;t took place, and &s;ubmitted to the Comptroller for his examination and approbation, when, if approved by him, a certificate to the Governor from his office, was &s;ent to this office, of the amount of the redeemable debt and intere&s;t, which was counter&s;igned by the Regi&s;ter, and &s;ent to the Secretary, on which a warrant i&s;&s;ued on the Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>"Of the ab&s;tracts in que&s;tion, No. 264-5-6-8, and one in favour of <HI>David Rittenhou&s;e,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> were a&s;&s;igned, and &s;ent from the Comptroller-General to this office, examined and entered as before &s;tated, and returned to the Comptroller-General on the 7th July, and warrants i&s;&s;ued the 9th, and were entered in this office on the 10th.</P>
<P>Ab&s;tract, No. 262, was &s;ent in the &s;ame manner from the Comptroller's office, entered in this the 9th July, and a warrant i&s;&s;ued on the 12th, and was entered the 14th in this office.</P>
<P>"Ab&s;tract, No. 272, was pre&s;ented by Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> on the 17th July, which was the fir&s;t time I knew of any New-Loans being &s;ub&s;cribed to the Loan of the United States, and not before. A conference took place between Comptroller and Regi&s;ter, in which it was &s;tated by the Comptroller, that they were within the Act of the U|nited States, and were certainly redeemable. In this I concurred, provided the conditions &s;tipulated by the Act of the United States, could be complied with: This he ob&s;erved was a matter of the United States, and that he had or would con&s;ult the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury on the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s progre&s;&s;ed in this manner until the 3d of April, when the committee on ways and means made the following report, viz.</P>
<P>The committee on Ways and Means to whom were referred &s;undry letters and documents relative to the &s;ub&s;cription to the Loan propo&s;ed by the United States, and the &s;ub&s;equent redemption of &s;undry certificates, formerly i&s;&s;ued under the authority of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and commonly called New-Loan, report on that &s;ubject&mdash;</P>
<P>That by a law pa&s;&s;ed on the 10th day of April 1792, among&s;t other provi&s;ion made for the redemption and final di&s;charge of &s;undry debts due by the common|wealth; in the &s;ixth &s;ection, it is enacted, That if Con|gre&s;s &s;hall on or before the fir&s;t day of July next, re|new and again open the &s;ub&s;cription to the loan hereto|fore propo&s;ed to the &s;tate creditors, or &s;hall in any other manner or upon any other terms, provide for the a&s;&s;ump|tion of the non-&s;ub&s;cribed debts owing to &s;uch &s;tate cre|ditors, the holder or holders of any certificate or certifi|cates, &s;ub&s;cribable to the &s;ub&s;cription &s;o renewed, or entit|led to the benefit of &s;uch other provi&s;ion, &s;hall be entitled to have and receive the nominal value of the &s;aid certi|ficate or certificates from the State-Trea&s;urer, upon this condition and not otherwi&s;e: that they &s;hall and do &s;ub|&s;cribe to the loan &s;o renewed, or acquie&s;ce in the terms of &s;uch other provi&s;ion, and thereupon, on or before the fir&s;t day of July next, transfer to the State-Trea|&s;urer, for the u&s;e of the commonwealth, each and every

the certificate and certificates which they &s;hall receive from the United States, in con&s;equence of &s;uch &s;ub|&s;cription, or all and &s;ingular the intere&s;ts and benefits to be derived from &s;uch other provi&s;ion, together with the proper evidences thereof.</P>
<P>That by the arrangements taken in con&s;equence of the law of Congre&s;s, extending the terms of their former loan, no certificates could i&s;&s;ue in favor of the &s;ub&s;crib|ers, prior to the 1&s;t day of May 1793; whereupon, it having been agreed that the receipts given by the com|mi&s;&s;ioner of loan, to the &s;ub&s;cribing &s;tate creditors, &s;hould be a&s;&s;igned to the commonwealth, and that the certificates from the Loan-office, &s;hould i&s;&s;ue directly to the commonwealth; the bu&s;ine&s;s was conducted un|der the following regulations: When the holder of any &s;tate-certificate or certificates, wi&s;hed to &s;ub&s;cribe the &s;ame to the loan propo&s;ed by Congre&s;s, and to avail him&s;elf of the benefit of the above-mentioned law of the commonwealth, pa&s;&s;ed in April 1792, he pre&s;ented &s;uch certificate or certificates, with an ab&s;tract of the &s;ame, &s;pecifying the number, date, by whom and to whom i&s;&s;ued, and the amount of the principal and in|tere&s;t, to the Comptroller- General, who after examin|ation certified on the face of the ab&s;tract, that the cer|tificates were genuine and a&s;&s;umable. The ab&s;tract be|ing then pre&s;ented to the commi&s;&s;ioner of loan, and the certificates them&s;elves depo&s;ited with him, the commi&s;|&s;ioner gave to the party a receitps for the &s;ame on the ab|&s;tract. The ab&s;tract and receipt were then a&s;&s;igned to the commonwealth, and pre&s;ented to the Regi&s;ter-Ge|neral and Comptroller-General for examination, and if approved, a certificate &s;igned by the two officers, was &s;ent to the Governor, &s;tating the amount due to the party, and a warrant for the &s;ame, thereupon i&s;&s;ued according to law.</P>
<P>That among&s;t other ab&s;tracts thus declared to be a&s;|&s;umable by the Comptroller, which pa&s;&s;ed the &s;everal offices, and the nominal amount of which (including both principal and intere&s;t,) was con&s;equently paid to the re&s;pective holders out of the State-Trea&s;ury, there
<PB N="85" REF="027132_0093_0FD34EEC16A82008">
were &s;undry certificates of that de&s;cription commonly called New-Loan, and which were i&s;&s;ued by virtue of an Act, entitled <Q>An Act for the further relief of the public creditors, who are citizens of this &s;tate, by re|ceiving on loan certain debts of the United States of <HI>America,</HI> and for funding the &s;ame, and for paying the annual intere&s;t of &s;uch loans, and the intere&s;t of certain debts of this &s;tate, every &s;ix months,</Q> pa&s;&s;ed on the fir&s;t day of March 1786; part of which Act was repealed by the Act, entitled <Q>An Act to repeal &s;o much of any Act or Acts of A&s;&s;embly of this com|monwealth, as directs the payment of the New-Loan debt, or the intere&s;t thereof, beyond the 1&s;t day of April next, and for other purpo&s;es therein mentioned,</Q> pa&s;&s;ed on the 27th day of March 1789, wherein it is enacted that the continental certificates received by the &s;tate by virtue of the former Act, &s;hall be returned to the holders of New-Loan certificates, upon their deli|vering the &s;ame, and that "&s;o much of every Act or Acts of General A&s;&s;embly as directs or &s;ecures the pay|ment of the principal &s;um or &s;ums, in the &s;aid certifi|cates or any of them mentioned, or of the intere&s;t there|of, beyond the term of four years, &s;hall be, and the &s;ame is hereby repealed and made null and void."</P>
<P>That the total amount of the New-Loan certificates thus redeemed by the &s;tate, at their nominal value, in|cluding the intere&s;t, amounts to 63,075 dollars and 37 cents; 60,220 dollars and 41 cents of which, were &s;ub|&s;cribed in the name, and of cour&s;e appear to be the pro|perty of <HI>John Nichol&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>The committee are of opinion that the Comptroller-General, in the above-mentioned tran&s;actions, has been guilty of a high mi&s;demeanor:&mdash;</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. By certifying the a&s;&s;umable quantity of the New-Loan certificates; the greater part of the &s;ame being his own property.</P>
<P>Second, By pa&s;&s;ing and certifying the &s;ame to the Executive in the u&s;ual forms of office; thereby cau&s;ing them to be redeemed.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="027132_0094_0FD34EEE62042CF8">The opinion of the committee on the fir&s;t point, is founded upon the following con&s;iderations&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. They conceive, that &s;ince the Act of March 1789, above mentioned, the New-Loan certificates cea&s;ed to be a &s;tate debt; were not, therefore, within the a&s;&s;ump|tion of, and could not be &s;ub&s;cribed to the loan propo&s;|ed by Congre&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. Whatever the deci&s;ion of the officers of the Trea|&s;ury of the United States might be on the preceding po&s;ition, as it was not, by law, the official duty of the Comptroller-General to decide on it, he ought not to have done &s;o, when a deci&s;ion given under the colour of office operated in his own favor, at the expence of the &s;tate.</P>
<P N="3">3d. In certifying the New-Loan certificates to be a&s;&s;umable, he neither con&s;ulted the Regi&s;ter-General, nor communicated the tran&s;action to the Governor; and as neither the ab&s;tracts on the face of which the a&s;&s;um|able quantity was certified, nor the official certificates on which warrants were i&s;&s;ued, did di&s;criminate the kind of debt that was redeemed; the checks provided by law were thereby de&s;troyed, and the other officers of the &s;tate deluded into error.</P>
<P N="4">4th. The Comptroller-General knew, by a former deci&s;ion of the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury of the United States, that at all events the New-Loan certificates could not be recognized as a&s;&s;umable, unle&s;s an equal amount of continental certificates was delivered to the Secretary afore&s;aid; which no law authori&s;ed the Comptroller to do: and he was appri&s;ed that the payment of the inter|e&s;t to the &s;ub&s;cribing &s;tate creditors and to the &s;tate, on account of the a&s;&s;umption, would have been &s;u&s;pended, when the time limited for receiving &s;ub&s;criptions to the former loan of Congre&s;s expired, had it not, upon inve&s;tigation, appeared that no New-Loan certificates had been &s;ub&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The opinion of the committee on the &s;econd point, ari&s;es from con&s;idering that, independent of the qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;|tion, Whether the New-Loan certificates were within
<PB N="87" REF="027132_0095_0FD34EF2C80F9D28">
the a&s;&s;umption of the United States, they were not re|deemable by the Act of April 1792? and this appears from the following con&s;iderations&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. No funds were provided by the Act for the re|demption of tho&s;e certificates.</P>
<P N="2">2d. The &s;ixth &s;ection of the Act can only be regard|ed as a provi&s;o and exception to the preceding &s;ections by which the redemption of certain de&s;criptions of debts, which do not include the New-Loan certificates, were exclu&s;ively and &s;olely contemplated.</P>
<P N="3">3d. Even the &s;ixth &s;ection, &s;uppo&s;ing it to &s;tand alone, cannot admit of the con&s;truction given by the Compt|roller-General, as it de&s;ignates only &s;tate-creditors, and by the exi&s;ting laws of the commonwealth, the holders of New-Loan certificates are declared not to be &s;uch.</P>
<P>Having &s;tated this ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ral view of the &s;ubject, the committee deem it their duty to pre&s;ent the following re&s;olutions to the con&s;ideration of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> That <HI>John Nichol&s;on,</HI> Comptroller-Gene|ral of this commonwealth, be impeached for a high mi&s;demeanor in his office.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> That the Attorney-General be directed to in&s;titute a &s;uit again&s;t the &s;aid <HI>John Nichol&s;on,</HI> to recover, for the u&s;e of the commonwealth, the amount of the New-Loan certificates, which have been redeemed and paid at the Trea&s;ury of this &s;tate.</P>
<P>The committee in the cour&s;e of their enquiries upon this occa&s;ion, have found rea&s;on to lament, that in the execution of the various, important and confidential du|ties, (embracing the emi&s;&s;ion of certificates and the care and management of other public property to an im|men&s;e amount) which have from time to time been a&s;|&s;igned to the Comptroller-General, an adequate check has in few ca&s;es been provided, and, in fewer &s;till, en|forced. They conceive, therefore, that the honor and intere&s;t of the &s;tate, require an early and effectual in|ve&s;tigation of the Comptroller's official tran&s;actions; and they would be wanting in their duty to the public and to them&s;elves, were they not to offer an earne&s;t re|commendation

<P>"THE Governor directs me to reque&s;t your opinion on the following &s;tatement.</P>
<P>"By an Act of the General A&s;&s;embly, pa&s;&s;ed on the fir&s;t day of March 1786, a loan was propo&s;ed, for the relief of the citizens of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> to receive certain continental certificates, in exchange for &s;tate certificates, then directed to be i&s;&s;ued, and u&s;ually called New-Loan certificates: By an Act pa&s;&s;ed the 27th of March 1789, it is declared, "that &s;o much of every Act or Acts of General A&s;&s;embly, as directs or &s;ecures the payment of the principal &s;um or &s;ums in the &s;aid certificates or any of them mentioned, or of the intere&s;t thereof, beyond the term of four years, &s;hall be, and the &s;ame is hereby repealed, and made null and void." And the re-ex|change of the New-Loan for continental certificates, was directed and regulated by the &s;ame Act, and in &s;ub|&s;equent

Acts, pa&s;&s;ed on the thirtieth of March and fir&s;t of April 1790: and by an Act of the 10th of April 1792, provi&s;ion is made for the redemption of certain &s;tate debts, and particularly, in the &s;ixth &s;ection, for paying the nominal amount of tho&s;e certificates, which are &s;ub&s;cribable to the loan propo&s;ed to the &s;tate credi|tors, by the Act of Congre&s;s, which was pa&s;&s;ed on the 4th of April 1790, and extended in it's operation by an Act of Congre&s;s pa&s;&s;ed on the eighth day of May 1792.</P>

<P>"ENGAGEMENTS at court have prevented me from returning an earlier an&s;wer to your favour of the 23d in&s;tant.</P>
<P>"I am of opinion that after the pa&s;&s;ing the Act of A&s;&s;embly of the 27th March, 1789, and the other Acts on the &s;ubject, the New-Loan certificates cea&s;ed to be a &s;tate debt within the view of the Legi&s;lature, and could not con&s;i&s;tently with tho&s;e laws, be recognized by the officers of the Federal or State government, for any other purpo&s;e than re-exchanging them for conti|nental certificates.</P>
<P>"I am al&s;o clearly and decidedly of opinion, that after the pa&s;&s;ing the above Act, the New-Loan certifi|cates cannot be included within the de&s;cription of the State debts directed to be redeemed and paid by the Act of the 10th April, 1792.</P>
<P>"The amount of Continental debt a&s;&s;umed by the State of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and for which New-Loan certi|ficates were given was about five millions of dollars.</P>
<P>"Part of this was redeemed by payments made at the Land-office and other payments in the State-Trea|&s;ury in the New-Loan certificates.</P>
<P>"But the &s;um remaining of this cla&s;s of certificates, was much more than the amount of the &s;um 2,200,000 dollars, which the United States agreed to a&s;&s;ume of State debt for <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI></P>
<P>"The State debt what was originally and properly &s;o called, and which the Legi&s;lature could only have had in contemplation when they made provi&s;ion for &s;uch deficiency, as they con&s;idered to be left unprovided for by the continental rule of a&s;&s;umption was about one million, or &s;ay 1,200,000 dollars.</P>
<P>"Suppo&s;e this &s;um to be, intere&s;t included 1,200,000 the United States would give certificates as follows, viz.</P>

<P><PB N="101" REF="027132_0109_0FD34F12D366FAE0">"So far as 6 per cents extend, the &s;tate con&s;idered this as a full provi&s;ion, in &s;atisfaction of the debt. But for the 400,000 dollars, 3 per cent. &s;tock, the &s;tate con|&s;idered it as only payment of one half, they therefore i&s;&s;ued other 3 per cent. &s;tock payable by the &s;tate to an equal amount, and for the deferred &s;tock on which the United States pay no intere&s;t, 'till the year 1801. The &s;tate agrees to pay intere&s;t annually at 6 per cent. per annum 'till that time.</P>
<P>"By the Act of April la&s;t, the &s;tate agrees to redeem the&s;e a&s;&s;umptions from the holders of the debt, by paying 10&shilling; in the pound for the 3 per cents, and &pound;. 39 per cent. for the deferred part, being the e&s;timated value of the annuity of 6 per cent. per annum for the time limited.</P>
<P>"This recapitulation of facts appears to me to &s;ugge&s;t the &s;olution of your &s;econd que&s;tion.</P>
<P>"If the New-Loan certificates are brought in a&s;&s;um|able by the United States, the &s;um may exceed the whole that Congre&s;s have agreed to a&s;&s;ume, and our A&s;&s;embly will have encouraged mea&s;ures for the exclu|&s;ion of the whole of our State debt from being a&s;&s;umed.</P>
<P>"Two motives may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have actuated our Legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>"Fir&s;t&mdash;To free the &s;tate from debt that in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity they might anticipate their re&s;ources by credit.</P>
<P>"Secondly&mdash;Selling the 3 per cent. &s;tock of the United States at 12&shilling; and paying off their 3 per cent. &s;tock at 10&shilling; affords an obvious advantage; in the deferred no le&s;s was &s;uffered, and therefore the balance in their favour remained.</P>
<P>"On the New-Loan certificates they were paying no intere&s;t, the continental certificates furni&s;hed the means of redemption at any moment, without expen&s;e, the rea&s;on of the law determines it's extent, neither of tho&s;e motives apply to the New-Loan certificates, it is impo&s;&s;ible that the &s;tate could have intended, that they &s;hould be a&s;&s;umed by the United States, or that they were in contemplation in the provi&s;ion made by the Act of April la&s;t.</P>

<P>One entry in the minutes of this day, and another of the eighth, re&s;pecting Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on's</HI> letters, are worthy of ob&s;ervation.

That cu&s;tom, which ex|tended to all the different de&s;criptions of certificates, though publicly known, does not appear to have been authori&s;ed by law. The rea&s;ons alledged to ju&s;tify it, are, that the intere&s;t of the &s;tate was promoted thereby, ina&s;much as it facilitated the payments in the Land-Office; and that it accommodated individuals very much, not only on account of &s;uch payments, but al&s;o in order to enable original or other holders, who were obliged to &s;ell a part of their certificates, to di&s;po&s;e of only a part, and to keep what they did not wi&s;h to &s;ell. It produced, however, at la&s;t, one very great di&s;advan|tage, which was taking up too great a proportion of the time of an officer, who&s;e duties were, perhaps, already too numerous. At all events it would have been better to have applied to the Legi&s;lature, in order to receive their &s;anction. It mu&s;t al&s;o be ob&s;erved, that that prac|tice had taken place in &s;ome in&s;tances, before the ap|pointment of the Comptroller; the Auditors appointed to &s;ettle the accounts, and i&s;&s;ue the certificates for the depreciation of pay, having renewed &s;ome of the cer|tificates they had granted.</P>
<P N="2">"II. Re-exchanging the continental certificates re|ceived on loan for the New-Loan certificates.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="027132_0128_0FD34F853390E998">"Two &s;etts of books were al&s;o opened for that pur|po&s;e, by the Comptroller; one of New-loan certificates received on exchange, the other of continental certifi|cates returned to the parties.</P>
<P>"In order fully to under&s;tand how they were kept, it is nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t to know in what manner the exchange was proceeded upon. An account of the New-Loan certificates he offered to be exchanged, was prepared, including the numbers of the &s;ame, and names of the grantees; the principal &s;um of each certificate, the number of years, intere&s;t paid by the &s;tate, and the date from which each began to bear intere&s;t, together with the amount of intere&s;t, either due on the face of the certificates upon the 31&s;t day of December, 1787, or paid by the &s;tate beyond the &s;ame date. To tho&s;e calculations were added, on the &s;ame account, the numbers and amount of the continental certificates re|turned by him in exchange, together with the date of intere&s;t commencing, and the amount of intere&s;t due on each, re&s;pectively, on the 31&s;t day of December, 1787. This la&s;t amount, together with the amount of intere&s;t paid by the &s;tate, upon the New-Loan certificates offered to be exchanged beyond the 31&s;t day of Decem|ber, 1787, was charged to the party applying for the exchange; and the amount of intere&s;t due on the face of the New-Loan certificate thus offered for exchange on the &s;aid 31&s;t day of December, 1787, was carried to the credit of the &s;aid party; and the difference be|tween the two amounts, was the &s;um to be paid in in|dents, or 3 per cent, &s;tock, either by, or to the party, in order to equalize the intere&s;t. All the accounts were numbered and filed; at the &s;ame time were entered, in di&s;tinct columns, in the book of continental certificates returned, the number of continental certificates returned to, and of New-Loan certificates received from each party; the amount of principal in &s;pecie dollars of the continental certificates: the date of intere&s;t commenc|ing on each; the amount of intere&s;t due on each on the 31&s;t day of December, 1787; and the amount of

indents or 3 per cent. &s;tock, paid to or by the parties, re&s;pectively. In the la&s;t column of each entry, the number of the account pre&s;ented was in&s;erted, and the party &s;igned his name, acknowledging the receipt or payment of indents.</P>
<P>In the book of New-Loan certificates received on exchange, which was filed afterwards by the help of the numbered accounts, were entered the number of each certificate received; the names of the grantees; the &s;ums of principal of each certificate; the years of in|tere&s;t paid by the &s;tate as endor&s;ed on the back of each certificate; the date at which intere&s;t commenced on the face of each certificate; and the amount of intere&s;t either due on the certificate on the 31&s;t of December, 1787, or overpaid by the &s;tate beyond the &s;ame date. In di&s;tinct columns were entered the numbers and amount of the New-Loan certificates, called <HI>Surplus Certificates,</HI> which were at fir&s;t i&s;&s;ued by virtue of the re&s;olutions of Council above-mentioned, in tho&s;e ca&s;es where the ex|act amount of the New-Loan offered for exchange, could not be paid in Continental certificates. After the pub|lic offices of the United States had been removed to <HI>Phi|ladelphia,</HI> that mode was no longer pur&s;ued, but the dif|ference which might be due to the parties, was, by the Comptroller, a&s;&s;igned to them in 6 per cent. and defer|red &s;tock, or regi&s;tered debt upon the books of the Trea|&s;ury of the United States. It is al&s;o proper here to ob|&s;erve, that although the above-de&s;cribed mode of ex|change was the common one, yet in &s;ome in&s;tances it was not followed, but the Comptroller a&s;&s;igned on the &s;aid books of the Trea&s;ury, to the parties, an amount of 6 per cent. deferred, and 3 per cent. &s;tock. equal to the amount of New-Loans offered by them for exchange. Whether this was done by the Comptroller's going and &s;ub&s;cribing him&s;elf for the parties, the Continental cer|tificates due to them, or whether he had previou&s;ly &s;ub|&s;cribed for that purpo&s;e a number of Continental certi|ficates depo&s;ited with him, your committee cannot pre|tend po&s;itively to decide. If the la&s;t, however conve|nient
<PB N="122" REF="027132_0130_0FD34F5A4738E850">
it might be, it was altogether unauthori&s;ed, either by law, or by any re&s;olutions of Council that have come to the knowledge of the committee. The books of Continental certificates delivered &s;o far as they are re|ceipted, are a complete proof of their being delivered, and at all events, that tran&s;action will be checked by the examination of the New-Loan certificates delivered to the Regi&s;ter.</P>
<P N="3">III. Receiving Continental and New-Loan certificates for the u&s;e of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The bulk of tho&s;e certificates were received from the Receiver-General of the Land-Office, and &s;ets of books were opened by the Comptroller, formed from the ac|counts delivered by the Receiver-General, containing the principal &s;ums of the certificates, the date to which intere&s;t had been paid upon each certificate, and the in|tere&s;t calculated upon each from that date to the 1&s;t of January, 1791. The amount of the New-Loan certi|ficates thus redeemed, is &pound;.118,470:6:6 <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="marg">Tho&s;e books do not contain the numbers of the certificates; but &s;o far as relates to the New-Loan certificates there is another auxiliary book containing the numbers of the certificates; the names of the grantees, the amount of principal, and the number of years; of intere&s;t paid at the time the Comptroller received the certificates. That book was formed by the Comptroller, from the certificates them&s;elves; but as the amount of tho&s;e books, to wit, &pound;. 118,179:10:6, did not agree with the amount of the other book, the committee adopted the re&s;ult of this, it being checked by the Receiver-General's accounts, and having been compared therewith by the Regi&s;ter-General.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The a|mount of Continental certificates is, &pound;.328,924:6:3. The calculations of intere&s;t are de&s;igned (by being checked by &s;imilar calculations made by the Regi&s;ter upon the certificates as delivered by the Comptroller) to &s;how that no intere&s;t was drawn upon the &s;ame by the Comptroller &s;ince he received the certificates. The &s;ame has been done in regard to certificates of all de|&s;criptions whatever, received by the Comptroller. In addition to the foregoing certificates, the Comptroller mu&s;t be charged with the Continental certificates men|tioned in the note <HI>(f);</HI> with one in the name of
<PB N="123" REF="027132_0131_0FD34F8824BC4048">

He mu&s;t likewi&s;e be charged with a New-Loan certificate, received of <HI>George Woods,</HI> as mentioned in former reports; and one of &pound;. equal to 533 77/90 dollars, received in balance of account from <HI>Atlee.</HI></P>
<P>"The annexed accounts marked A, B, C, D, E, F, will fully explain the accounts of the Comptroller, as to this fir&s;t head.</P>
<P>"The account A, is introductory to the others, and exhibits the general account of the New-Loan debt. By that account it appears that the amount of New-Loan certificates yet in circulation, is &pound;. 33,722:3, which amount includes tho&s;e offered for &s;ub&s;cription to the loan of the United States. The Comptroller has prepared from his books a li&s;t of the identical certificates thus out&s;tanding; but it is not perfectly checked; as &s;oon as the Regi&s;ter-General &s;hall have arranged the cer|tificates delivered to him in numerical order, he will be able to form an accurate li&s;t of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>"The Comptroller &s;hould have in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion an amount of Continental certificates equal to that balance of New-Loan out&s;tanding. From the examination made by the committee of the certificates of that de&s;cription in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, it appears that he has only 81,384 11/90. dol|lars, equal to &pound;.30,519:0:11, leaving a deficiency of &pound;.3,203:2:1, equal to 8,541 55/90 dollars, for which he mu&s;t account. The &s;ame re&s;ult will appear from the account of the Comptroller with the Continental certi|ficates received upon loan, marked C, and from his ac|count with the Continental certificates received for the &s;tate, marked D, it appears that he is indebted for a balance of 3,914 41/100 dollars; the&s;e two balances toge|ther make a &s;um of 12,456 2/90 <HI>dollars,</HI> 3.</P>

<P>"Books of tho&s;e certificates, i&s;&s;ued, redeemed by the Land-Office, and renewed, have been kept by the Comptroller, which are &s;imilar to tho&s;e kept for other kind of certificates, as mentioned under the foregoing heads. The committee were anxious to inve&s;tigate whether tho&s;e certificates had always i&s;&s;ued upon proper principles, and for debts ju&s;tly due, and whether they had always been granted to the parties thereto entitled. But as all the vouchers and receipts relative thereto, were, (as the Comptroller informed the committee) lodged with the commi&s;&s;ioners appointed to &s;ettle the accounts of the individual &s;tates with the United States, it was thought better to defer the inve&s;tigation, till after the 1&s;t day of July, at which time the appointment of the commi&s;&s;ioners expired. When that day came, how|ever, the Comptroller informed the committee, that tho&s;e papers were kept in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the United States, both as vouchers of the claims of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and as checks again&s;t future demands that might hereafter be made by individuals. The committee applied a few days after to the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury of the United States, for leave of having acce&s;s to tho&s;e vouchers&mdash; This was granted by the Secretary, (as will appear by his letter of the 17th of July) provided the examination was confined to the papers of the commonwealth, and not extended to any &s;tatements or remarks of the late commi&s;&s;ioners; but it was at the &s;ame time reque&s;ted that the in&s;pection &s;hould be deferred till the return of Mr. <HI>Farrel,</HI> late clerk of the commi&s;&s;ioners, who alone knew the di&s;po&s;ition of the papers, and was then ab&s;ent. Upon being informed of the return of Mr. <HI>Farrel,</HI> the committee wrote a &s;econd letter to the Secretary on the 5th of Augu&s;t.

<P>"I WAS honored with your excellency's letter of the 2d in&s;tant, covering an extract of a letter from Capt. <HI>Jonas Simonds;</HI> and I have al&s;o received yours of this date, with the enclo&s;ure on the &s;ubject of the claim for the arrearages of clothing of the &s;aid <HI>Jonas Simonds,</HI> and, in obedience, I have recon&s;idered the &s;aid claim, and the rea&s;ons urged in &s;upport of it.</P>
<P>"If a recommendatory act of Congre&s;s was obligatory on the &s;everal &s;tates, unle&s;s adopted by tho&s;e &s;tates, then would there be doubt the claim made for the arrearages of captain <HI>Simonds'</HI> clothing &s;hould be allowed, under the Act of Congre&s;s of October, 1780, as well as the claim of &s;undry officers in the regiment of cavalry, belonging to the line of this &s;tate, and others, in &s;imilar &s;ituation, who&s;e accounts have been rejected; as well as many other claims, which this &s;tate have not agreed to, although recommended by Congre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="027132_0157_0FD34F4E57F719F0">"If the having received &s;tate &s;tores, as they were called, from this &s;tate, were the rule to determine the per&s;ons entitled to the benefits of the Act of March 1&s;t, 1780, then would commi&s;&s;aries, forage ma&s;ters, conductors of military &s;tores, waggon-ma&s;ters, and even the auditors of the main army have been entitled to arrearages of clothing, for each of the&s;e have received &s;tores, as may be &s;een by the accounts thereof; in|deed, there is one account rai&s;ed by the officers who i&s;&s;ued &s;tores of this &s;tate, for detached artillery belonging to the &s;tate of <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P>"I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to have been on the mu&s;ters in the regiment to which he was annexed, and where he &s;erved, would &s;ub&s;tantiate this claim, the claims to clothing of the officers from <HI>Connecticut, Jer&s;ey,</HI> and <HI>Virginia,</HI> in the <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> regiment of cavalry, before mentioned, would have been well founded al&s;o. Indeed, I cannot conceive of his commanding a company in this regiment, to which he was attached, and being mu&s;tered at all, without being mu&s;tered where he &s;erved; the&s;e mu&s;ters do not &s;pecify the &s;tate to which the officers re&s;pectively belonged. He was not commi&s;&s;ioned as an officer of the <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> line, by his being at|tached to the <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> line; the Act of Congre&s;s afore&s;aid, (not of the &s;tate) allowed him to be treated in the &s;ame manner, &amp;c.&mdash;to be like another, and to be that other, are different.</P>
<P>"If the having had his certificates funded with the &s;tate, would &s;up|port the claim in que&s;tion, then would generals <HI>Muhlenbergh</HI> and <HI>Neville,</HI> of the <HI>Virginia</HI> line; major <HI>James Moore,</HI> of the <HI>Delaware</HI> line; and other officers of the lines of different &s;tates, who had become citizens of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and had their certificates loaned&mdash;been al&s;o entitled to arrears of clothing. Captain <HI>Simonds</HI> was a citizen of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and as &s;uch entitled to have his certificates loaned.</P>
<P>"The ob&s;ervations, that he received a donation of land, and an ad|vance of 5 &frac12; months pay, from the &s;tate, lo&s;e their force, where it is con&s;idered that was done through mi&s;take; when I made the returns to Council, upon which the&s;e benefits were granted, I did not know capt. <HI>Simonds'</HI> &s;ituation; and the &s;ame mi&s;take, at fir&s;t, induced me to pa&s;s the account in que&s;tion, where it would probably have remained, had not an|other officer repre&s;ented it, who &s;aw and complained that he could not get what was granted to another in a &s;imilar ca&s;e.&mdash;The five and a half months pay is credited to <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> by the <HI>United States,</HI> and it hath been already &s;topped from captain <HI>Simonds.</HI>&mdash;Re&s;pecting the donation land, I have already addre&s;&s;ed your excellency, in order that it may be recovered to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>"Although the &s;tate &s;tores were i&s;&s;ued without due regularity at fir&s;t, yet after the Act of March 1&s;t, 1780, I have examined, and do not find that any was i&s;&s;ued from this &s;tate to captain <HI>Simonds:</HI> I have in|clo&s;ed a number of weekly returns of that company, from which you will &s;ee, that the <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> officers only are included, and that this is left out; the one dated December 25th, 1780, after having been made out for the others, your excellency will ob&s;erve, has had captain <HI>Simonds'</HI> name added in colonel <HI>Porter</HI>'s hand, on the 31&s;t of December, 1780, and his proportion of rations al&s;o carried out, and added to the other

<P>"And further, he did not receive his depreciation of pay from this &s;tate, but that to which he belonged.</P>
<P>"Moreover, when, according to the very act on which arrearages are now claimed, clothing was provided at the time, by the Council, for each per&s;on entitled, they directed a &s;uit for each of the other officers of this company, and none for captain <HI>Simonds.</HI> If he was not entitled to clothing then, he could not be entitled to arrears therefor afterwards.</P>

<P>"By a re&s;olution of Congre&s;s pa&s;&s;ed the 3d of No|vember, 1783, it was, Re&s;olved, That the Payma&s;ter-General depo&s;it in the hands of regimental Agents, the certificates for the arrears of pay due to the officers and &s;oldiers of the re&s;pective lines, to be by them delivered to the individuals to whom they belong, or depo&s;ited for their benefit as the &s;upreme executive of the &s;tate to which the re&s;pective Agents belong &s;hall direct.</P>
<P>"By an arrangement which was rendered nece&s;&s;ary on account of the di&s;per&s;ed &s;ituation of the <HI>Penn&s;ylva|nia</HI> line, two agents for the whole line, (in&s;tead of re|gimental agents) to wit, Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Bowen</HI> and <HI>Beatty</HI> were recommended by the officers of the line, approved of by Council, and their appointment confirmed by Con|gre&s;s.

<SALUTE>"GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"HAVING ye&s;terday completed all that appeared wanting on my part at our accounts with the U. States, before the commi&s;&s;ioners, I have now more time to devote to your examinations according to your appoint|ment. I have your letters of the 24th and 26th in&s;tant before me: and</P>
<P N="1">"1&s;t. That it was my wi&s;h to dive&s;t my&s;elf previous to the clo&s;e of this examination, of all future re&s;pon&s;ibility as far as po&s;&s;ible, that there may be no attempts to excite &s;u&s;picions again&s;t me hereafter, and there|fore have preferred delivering over to the Regi&s;ter-General, in ca&s;e of the &s;tate certificates, and taking a credit for the amount receipted for, to your examining them and leaving them in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2">"2d. It was my wi&s;h al&s;o, not only to &s;ettle my accounts of the cer|tificates of the army, and money which I have received from various per|&s;ons for their pay; but to dive&s;t my&s;elf of the trouble and re&s;pon&s;ibility thereof in future: but it is proper I &s;hould &s;ettle with tho&s;e empowered to do it, and quiet me. The&s;e I conceive to be the proper officers of the United States; and as the officers of the Trea&s;ury of the United States are now as convenient, the party may as well apply there in future, with all their claims, as with a part: and I therefore determined to deliver over to the United States, to whom they belong all the re|maining property as afore&s;aid, not delivered out, on which I con&s;ulted and had the approbation of the Governor, and am now making up the&s;e accounts, and preparing accordingly, and they will be completed as &s;oon as I can.</P>
<P N="3">"3d. I cannot conceive how the delivery of the&s;e certificates could be deemed any part of my duty as Comptroller-General, it has no con|nection with any of the duties of that office. I have &s;o con&s;idered it, I always de&s;igned and &s;hall obtain a di&s;tinct compen&s;ation allowed by the United States.</P>
<P N="4">"4th. I have been de&s;ired by the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury of the United States to account and &s;ettle as above, who repre&s;ents that mo&s;t of the agents have already &s;o accounted, and is de&s;irous that it &s;hould

be done by all. I have informed him it &s;hall be done, and that acting for <HI>Bowen</HI> and <HI>Beatty,</HI> I &s;hall al&s;o &s;ettle all their &s;aid accounts in like manner with my own.</P>
<P N="5">"5th. I have con&s;idered the inclo&s;ures of your letter of the 24th in&s;t. none of which I had before &s;een, except &s;o far as the Acts of Congre&s;s were recited, they rather confirm than alter my ideas on the &s;ubject. It appears that although the late Supreme Executive of this &s;tate were ap|plied to for confirming the choice of the agents made by a meeting of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> officers, they refu&s;ed &s;o to do, and not conceiving them&s;elves authorized, they referred it to Congre&s;s either to confirm the appointment of tho&s;e agents, or to appoint &s;uch other per&s;ons as they thought pro|per; and Congre&s;s, by their Act of the 4th May, 1784, did approve and confirm the choice of tho&s;e agents made by the officers, whereby they were authorized to act.</P>

<P>"YOUR excellency not having contemplated it as a &s;ubject in which any controver&s;y would be involved, and having &s;ince more fully before you the que&s;tion of the di&s;po&s;ition of the unclaimed continental certificates in my hands, for the pay of the late army.

<P>"Having thus premi&s;ed, I ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>"Fir&s;t.

<P>"ON the 3d in&s;t. I received your excellency's letter of the 1&s;t, cover|ing the opinion of the Attorney-General of the 25th of June la&s;t; on this I have to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">"1&s;t That this opinion is founded much on matters &s;tated as a fact, which are not &s;o, and which I &s;hould have been able to prove, had the matter been put on the i&s;&s;ue I propo&s;ed.</P>
<P N="2">"2d. That admitting the certificates depo&s;ited with <HI>Bowen</HI> and <HI>Beatty,</HI> or with <HI>Bowen</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;h,</HI> who acted for <HI>Beatty;</HI> or with my&s;elf who acted for them both, were to be con&s;idered in the &s;ame view as tho&s;e depo&s;ited with regimental agents, and therefore within the Act of Con|gre&s;s of Nov. 3d, 1783, &s;ubjecting them to the order of the Supreme Executive of the &s;tate, that power extends only to enable the Supreme Executive to order them out of the hands of one per&s;on or per&s;ons, to be depo&s;ited in the hands of another per&s;on or per&s;ons, and declares for what purpo&s;e they &s;hall be &s;o depo&s;ited, that is to be delivered out by them to the party. But as to the &s;ettlement of the accounts, the thing I am anxious to have done, it gives no &s;uch power to the executives of the &s;tate.</P>
<P N="3">"3d. All the books I received from major <HI>Bowen</HI> in behalf of the agents, together with the papers other than the certificates, con&s;i&s;t of two large receipt books, orders and vouchers for the delivery of certificates. The&s;e are yet un&s;ettled, and will until adju&s;ted by the United States, to whom in their behalf I render them for that purpo&s;e, as they have de&s;ired, whereby the &s;aid account will be clo&s;ed; the papers I have in this bu&s;ine&s;s are al&s;o vouchers, &s;uch as orders, and receipts for delivery of certificates, which receipts I have generally taken in the &s;aid agent's name, and which mu&s;t (unle&s;s I &s;ettle with the agents) be adju&s;ted al&s;o with the United States, before the &s;ame accounts can be clo&s;ed, the latter I intend to have done; the other papers re&s;pecting the delivery of certificates received from Mr. <HI>Pierce,</HI> are of the &s;ame kind, and to be &s;ettled in the &s;ame way with the United States.</P>
<P N="4">"4th. I have been de&s;ired by the United States &s;o to &s;ettle, and a
<PB N="167" REF="027132_0175_0FD34F99FABF94D0">
part of the&s;e accounts, with the certificates were rendered, and are now under the examination in the offices, and I pre&s;ume my duty and honor both will be better pur&s;ued and pre&s;erved in this way, than in &s;ubmitting them to tho&s;e who have nothing to do with them, more than other per&s;ons, and by that means be prevented from obtaining a &s;ettlement in due time from tho&s;e legally authorized to do it.</P>

But the organization of the department of the accounts of the United States, by &s;ub&s;equent Acts of Congre&s;s, directs the channel in which all &s;uch accounts &s;hall be rendered and &s;ettled; which will be ob&s;erved by Sir,</P>

<P>THE additional articles of impeachment were read the &s;econd time&mdash;Major <HI>M'Connell</HI> appeared at the bar of the Hou&s;e, and being duly &s;worn, an&s;wered the following interrogatories.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;tion by</HI> Mr. <HI>Gallatin.</HI> Have you been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any New-Loan certificates in the year 1788?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> I had a quantity of New-Loan certificates about that time, but at pre&s;ent cannot a&s;certain their amount or numbers.</P>
<P><HI>By the &s;ame.</HI> Did you &s;ell a certificate of that de&s;|cription amounting to &pound;. 3275:19:4 to <HI>Blair M'Clena|chan,</HI> if yea, plea&s;e to tell at what time?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> It appears from my book, that I delivered &s;uch a certificate to Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan,</HI> the 23d day April, 1788, which had been i&s;&s;ued in my own name. I de|livered him many New-Loan certificates about that time.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;. by Do.</HI> Do you know what he did with that cer|tificate who&s;e amount was &pound;. 3275:19; 4, did he &s;ell it, or did he exchange it?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Impo&s;&s;ible for me to tell what Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> had done with it, the certificate was his own after he got it from me. I believe an exchange took place be|tween him and the Comptroller-General, but in this I am not po&s;itive.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;tion by</HI> Mr. <HI>Evans.</HI> Have you a li&s;t of the names of the per&s;ons to whom the certificates which you then had, were originally granted?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I have a book at home, in which I have entered their amounts, &amp;c. but at this time I cannot be par|ticular.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;. by</HI> Mr. <HI>Gallatin.</HI> Had you any other New-Loan certificate of the &s;ame amount i&s;&s;ued in your name, about that time, before that time, or &s;ince that period?</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="027132_0194_0FD34FBA4D081EE0"><HI>An&s;.</HI> Not likely that I &s;hould have another of the &s;ame amount in my own name, it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to a&s;certain.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;tion by</HI> Mr. <HI>Evans.</HI> Can you tell the number of that certificate, for &pound;. 3275:19:4?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I cannot a&s;certain it, not having the No. of that one in my book.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;. by</HI> Mr. <HI>Gallatin.</HI> Can you a&s;certain the time when this certificate was i&s;&s;ued, and whether it was an original one, or i&s;&s;ued for a number of certificates, com|monly called <HI>con&s;olidating?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I am inclined to think it had been i&s;&s;ued in exchange for others by the means la&s;t mentioned: but I am not certain as to that, nor to the time when i&s;&s;ued.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> ob&s;erved he had no more que&s;tions to a&s;k, and that the witne&s;s might retire.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;. by</HI> Mr. <HI>Evans.</HI> Can you furni&s;h us with a li&s;t of the names of the per&s;ons to whom i&s;&s;ued, numbers, dates and amounts of the certificates which you deliver|ed to <HI>Blair M'Clenachan</HI> about the time alluded to?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I have a book, from which I will extract &s;uch dates, numbers, and amount as far as I have entered them, and will tran&s;mit a li&s;t to the Hou&s;e as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>After which the witne&s;s retired.</P>
<P>Whereupon it was re&s;olved that the further con&s;idera|tion of the &s;aid additional articles of impeachment be po&s;tponed till the next day.</P>
<P>And the Speaker i&s;&s;ued his &s;ummons to accelerate the attendance of <HI>Blair M,Clenachan</HI> to give te&s;timony on the&s;e articles again&s;t Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>It was on motion, Ordered that Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Morgan, Evans</HI> and <HI>Gallatin,</HI> the three managers, &s;hould procure atte&s;t|ed documents from Mr. <HI>Thomas Smith,</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioner of Loans, to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of evidence on the&s;e articles again&s;t the Comptroller.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Blair M'Clenachan</HI> having been &s;ummoned pre|vious to the third in&s;tant, when Mr. <HI>M'Connell</HI> gave his evidence, and not appearing, a motion had been made to compel his attendance by an attachment, whereupon &s;ome argument had en&s;ued, and it was con|ceded, that he did not ab&s;ent him&s;elf thro' contumacy, but through a belief and expectation that the General A&s;|&s;embly had adjourned on account of the di&s;order, con|&s;equently no further notice had been taken of his non-attendance.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> ro&s;e, and &s;aid he would put the witne&s;s right, &s;aying, "I will mention a circum&s;tance, Do you remember that a large New-Loan certificate had been i&s;&s;ued about the time alluded to, for the &s;um of &pound;. 5000 or thereabouts; that the &s;aid certificate had been can|celled the next day, and two certificates i&s;&s;ued in lieu thereof, the aggregate amount of which was &pound;. 5000, as afore&s;aid; that one of the&s;e certificates had been for &pound;. 3275:19:4, and the other for the balance, do you remember any of the&s;e circum&s;tances?"</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I perfectly recollect that circum&s;tance, and that I purcha&s;ed the larger certificate, which was for 3275l. 19s. 4d, I believe.</P>

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> No, I kept them to the la&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;. by ditto.</HI> Did Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> receive an equi|valent in continental certificates from the Comptroller for the la&s;t de&s;cribed certificate for &pound;. 3275:19:4, or did he (Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan)</HI> &s;ub&s;cribe it in his own name to the Loan of the United States?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I received an equivalent in continental certifi|cates, as well as I can recollect, for all that I brought to the Comptroller's office.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;. by</HI> Mr. <HI>Hare.</HI> Can Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> a&s;certain the time when this tran&s;action happened?</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Bingham</HI> then moved that the Sergeant-at-Arms be directed to notify Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> to walk in. The motion was agreed to, the Comptroller walked in, being unattended by any per&s;on, bowing to the chair, and then to the per&s;ons on the right hand, and on the left.</P>

country, from which the mo&s;t of our rules, and pre|cedents were copied: They found it nece&s;&s;ary in that country to bring notorious offenders to the grande&s;t tribunal of the nation: therefore impeachments were found to have been conducted before the hou&s;e of lords in <HI>England</HI> as early as the year 1321.</P>
<P>This being the propere&s;t court where per&s;ons of for|tune and influence &s;hould be tried, and where deception and impo&s;ition could not avail, nor have any weight.</P>
<P>In <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> few in&s;tances had occurred, the pro|ceedings are circum&s;cribed, and &s;he has adopted the practice of <HI>England</HI> by ingrafting this precedent in her con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent impeachment was brought forward a|gain&s;t this officer by the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of this commonwealth, conformably to the precedent above alluded to, and agreeably to the con&s;titution which pre|&s;cribes, that "The Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives &s;hall have the &s;ole power of impeaching."</P>
<P>"All impeachments &s;hall be tried by the Senate. When &s;itting for that purpo&s;e, the Senators &s;hall be upon oath or affirmation. No per&s;on &s;hall be convicted, without the concurrence of two thirds of the members pre&s;ent."</P>

<P>He &s;aid that the amount of New-Loans which were redeemed was about 63,000 dollars, and that Mr. <HI>Ni|chol&s;on</HI> owned about 60,000 dollars of that &s;um.</P>
<P>He read the preamble to the Act of the 16th March, 1786, explaining the views of the Legi&s;lature to pro|vide for the payment of the debts due to the citizens of this commonwealth, as Congre&s;s could not; the 13th &s;ection was then read as being more immediately con|nected with the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; the 14th &s;ection de&s;cribes the cla&s;s of creditors to be relieved, and gives a de&s;crip|tion of the certificates which were entitled to intere&s;t.</P>
<P>He read a long report of a grand committee of Con|gre&s;s, Sept. 24, 1785, Journals of Congre&s;s, volume 10, page 310, 311, 329, and con&s;equent re&s;olution, by which it appeared that Congre&s;s were di&s;&s;atisfied at the mode pur&s;ued by <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and forbid their Com|mi&s;&s;ioner of Loans to &s;ettle or i&s;&s;ue, unle&s;s as therein provided, that is with the&s;e States who had complied with the requi&s;ition of 1781.</P>
<P>This was di&s;agreeable to <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> who afterwards pa&s;&s;ed the Act of March 1, 1786, with a view to count|eract the mea&s;ures contemplated in the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s, and to accommodate the citizens of this &s;tate, who were creditors of the United States. And near two million pounds of New-Loans had been i&s;&s;ued.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Morgan</HI> gave the hi&s;tory of New-Loans, i&s;&s;ued in con&s;equence of this Act of March 1, 1786&mdash;repealed by Act of March 27th, 1789, the intere&s;t paid for four years; the &s;econd and third &s;ections are the mo&s;t mate|rial parts of the repealing Act&mdash;the former principles are recognized in this Act, and after its pa&s;&s;ing no other

u&s;e could be made of the New-Loans than to exchange them for Continental certificates.</P>
<P>They could no longer continue a claim, as the law was repealed which con&s;tituted them a claim: It be|came difficult from payments in the Land-Office to re|turn continental certificates, and the fund from the Land-Office was added in-con&s;equence of the practice of &s;plitting certificates.</P>
<P>In the repealing Act of 1789 the Legi&s;lature con|templated to re&s;tore their debts to the parties&mdash;<HI>Penn&s;yl|vania</HI> de&s;igned an exoneration on the return of the con|tinental certificates, on one &s;ingle condition, to wit, the re&s;toration of tho&s;e certificates to the parties.</P>
<P>The State has been injured, the criminality of per|&s;ons depends much upon circum&s;tances, &s;he is injured not by her own acts, but by the conduct of one of her officers, by a wrong con&s;truction of law, whether wilful or mi&s;taken, the Senate will judge when the facts and evidence will be laid before them.</P>
<P>This con&s;truction under the Act of the 10th April, 1792, has involved the State in a lo&s;s of near 15000 dollars, and this immen&s;e lo&s;s has been &s;u&s;tained by this con&s;truction of the pre&s;ent defendant.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Morgan</HI> read part of the 12th and 13th &s;ections of the Act of Congre&s;s of the 4th Augu&s;t, 1790, which contemplates only the a&s;&s;umption of certificates i&s;&s;ued for &s;ervices or &s;upplies, none excepted but "certificates i&s;&s;ued by the commi&s;&s;ioners of army accounts in the &s;tate of <HI>North-Carolina</HI> in the year 1786."</P>
<P>The Act of 27th March, 1789, pa&s;&s;ed before the Act of the 4th of Augu&s;t, 1790; If the New-Loans are not &s;ub&s;cribable to the fir&s;t loan, they cannot be to the &s;econd of the 8th May, 1792. The idea of &s;ub|&s;cribing them never entered the mind of any per&s;on during the continuance of the fir&s;t loan.</P>
<P>He read the Act of A&s;&s;embly of the 9th of April, 1791, re&s;pecting purparts, for making up the deficien|cy of intere&s;t on continental loans, the Legi&s;lature con|&s;idered the per&s;ons relieved here as their only creditors,
<PB N="213" REF="027132_0221_0FD350899792D9E0">
who&s;e debts were &s;ub&s;cribable, had New-Loans been con&s;idered as exi&s;ting debts, equal provi&s;ion would have been made for them in the &s;aid Act.</P>
<P>In the next place he adverted to the Act of the 10th of April, 1792, in which Act the Legi&s;lature determined to pay off their proper debts with the purparts. The 2d &s;ection appropriates the &s;tock to pay the debts men|tioned in the fir&s;t &s;ection, the &s;ection de&s;cribes, 1, the fund; 2, the debts, here he ob&s;erved that it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;ee if New-Loans were included; the intere&s;t on New-Loans was not payable at this time. As it is under a con&s;truction of this law the articles of impeach|ment were brought forward, it was nece&s;&s;ary to pay proper attention to it, and to weigh the particular &s;tate of the affair with the eyes of &s;crutiny and candor.</P>
<P>This is the con&s;truction put on it by us, we cannot tell what is the con&s;truction of the Comptroller, or his coun&s;el. Agreeably to the duties required of the Gover|nor for the purpo&s;e of carrying this Act into execution, it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to have an account of the debts. &mdash;He therefore applied to the Comptroller and Regi&s;ter-General, who e&s;timated the debt to be redeemed, and the &s;tock to be &s;old; this e&s;timate, Mr. <HI>Morgan</HI> &s;aid, did not include New-Loans, but thro' &s;ome fatality this document has been lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Had the Legi&s;lature de&s;igned to redeem the New-Loan certificates it was nece&s;&s;ary to appropriate larger funds&mdash;The &s;tock which had been ordered to be &s;old, was only adequate to the other debt.</P>
<P>The fifth &s;ection refers only to certificates mentioned in the &s;econd &s;ection.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth &s;ection is apparently more indefinite and uncertain, and depended upon what provi&s;ion Congre&s;s would make.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Morgan</HI> then read the Act of Congre&s;s of the 8th of May, 1792, &s;upplementary to the Act of Au|gu&s;t, 1790, which is extended on the &s;ame terms, &s;ame con&s;truction mu&s;t be attached to each Act, as both Acts are on the &s;ame principles. Here he referred to the 2d

&s;ection of the Act of Congre&s;s of the 8th May, 1792, relative to non-&s;ub&s;cribing creditors, to get the &s;ame intere&s;t which he &s;aid, merited particular attention.</P>
<P>In the 6th &s;ection of the Act of the 10th of April, 1792, as it is confined to the a&s;&s;umption before the fir&s;t of July, and nothing could &s;trictly be done conformably to it under the la&s;t Act of Congre&s;s, becau&s;e no certi|ficates could i&s;&s;ue under it until March the 1&s;t, 1793: This compared with the 6th &s;ection of the Act of A&s;|&s;embly of the 10th April, 1792, it became impo&s;&s;ible that both laws could be literally and expre&s;sly complied with; a corre&s;pondence took place, between the Gover|nor, Secretary of the commonwealth, Comptroller-Ge|neral and the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury of the United States, and arrangements were made accordingly&mdash;all the extracts which he read were repeated, reiterated, dilated and de&s;canted upon, placing every &s;ubject in various points of view: remarked that he had gone through the different laws of the United States, and acts of this commonwealth, which were connected with this bu&s;ine&s;s, that he would then be under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of referring to written documents and oral te&s;ti|mony; that the letters were numerous and lengthy, and as it was then within a quarter of two he propo&s;ed de|ferring the reading of the letters until the next day.</P>
<P>The Speaker a&s;ked Mr. <HI>Morgan</HI> how long it would take to go through them, he an&s;wered, two or three hours, whereupon the Speaker adjourned the trial until 11 o'clock the next day.</P>
<P>In the minutes of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives the following entry is recorded:</P>
<P>"In conformity to the re&s;olution adopted ye&s;terday, the Hou&s;e re&s;olved it&s;elf into a committee of the whole, for the purpo&s;e of attending the trial of <HI>John Nichol&s;on,</HI> Comptroller-General.</P>

<P>He ob&s;erved that the actions of the Comptroller-Gene|ral were contrary to his (the Comptroller's) own opinion re&s;pecting the redeemability of the certificates in que&s;|tion, and that this could be manife&s;t from the letters to be produced, which were written by that officer, by the Regi&s;ter-General and other public officers&mdash;for this purpo&s;e he began with the following letter.</P>

They were not evidences of debt when certified, as the law was repealed. The Secretary of the Trea&s;ury could not be acquainted with our laws, and the certifi|cates on the face of them appeared to be for debts.

<P>In a &s;ub&s;equent letter the Secretary gives a different opinion. He read the following:&mdash;</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>"Trea&s;ury Department,</HI> <DATE>Augu&s;t 21, 1793.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>"SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"I HAVE had the honor of your letter of the 29th of July la&s;t which the pre&s;s of bu&s;ine&s;s has prevented my &s;ooner an&s;wering.</P>
<P>"The certificates to which you refer have not been admitted upon the loan propo&s;ed by the acts of Con|gre&s;s payable in evidences of State debt.</P>
<P>"The following circum&s;tances have attended the ca&s;e. Certificates of the de&s;cription of tho&s;e called New-Loan certificates of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> to the amount of 65,210 dollars and 28 cents were offered for &s;ub&s;crip|tion under the Act, entitled "An Act &s;upplementary to the Act for making provi&s;ion for the debt of the U. S."</P>
<P>"It appeared (a circum&s;tance which had not come to my knowledge till after tho&s;e certificates were &s;o offer|ed) that there was a law of the commonwealth of <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania</HI> which rendered it que&s;tionable whether they could legally be con&s;idered as a &s;ub&s;i&s;ting debt of the commonwealth, a quality nece&s;&s;ary to their being a&s;&s;um|able, and an opinion of thee Attorney-General of <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania</HI>
<PB N="219" REF="027132_0227_0FD3508B950ABBE8">
was communicated to me, &s;hewing that he did not view them as a &s;ub&s;i&s;ting debt of the commonwealth.</P>
<P>"This led me to &s;tate the ca&s;e for the con&s;ideration of the Attorney-General of the United States, who gave an opinion that the Acts of the <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> A&s;|&s;embly of the 27th of March, 1789, and of the 30th of March and 1&s;t of April, 1790, aboli&s;hed the certi|ficates in que&s;tion as debts of the &s;tate except for the purpo&s;e of being re-exchanged for Continental certifi|cates, and therefore that the former as wanting the due recognition from that &s;tate could not be legally received upon loan.</P>
<P>"To this opinion I was about to conform and to direct the rejection of the certificates offered to the loan.</P>
<P>"But having learnt that there was a probability of a ju|dicial inve&s;tigation of the point, I forebore to give a final in&s;truction concerning it and left the matter &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>"When the commi&s;&s;ioners were about to clo&s;e the &s;ettlement of accounts between the united and indivi|dual States it became nece&s;&s;ary to certify to them the amount of the debt of this commonwealth which had been admitted upon loan. The cour&s;e pur&s;ued was to certify ab&s;olutely the &s;um which had been &s;ub&s;cribed and finally admitted, and to &s;tate in a note the amount and &s;ituation of the certificates in que&s;tion which had been offered to the loan and not admitted. It is un|der&s;tood that this amount was not embraced in the &s;tate|ment of the Commi&s;&s;ioners.</P>
<P>"There has been no &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the intere&s;t on &s;o much of the debt of the commonwealth as was &s;ub&s;crib|ed and admitted upon the loan.</P>
<P>"The&s;e circum&s;tances amount to a virtual rejection of the certificates to which your enquiry is under&s;tood to have reference.</P>

<P>When I read the letter of the Secretary of the Trea|&s;ury referred to afore&s;aid, I was doubtful until I con|&s;ulted it again, whether it really imported that the in|tere&s;t payable quarterly on the certificates granted on the A&s;&s;umed debt of this &s;tate, would be &s;u&s;pended until the certificates of the Federal debt not yet exchang|ed for the New-Loans as afore&s;aid &s;hould be &s;urrendered or an equivalent in &s;tock under the funding &s;y&s;tem, as &s;uch a ca&s;e would pro&s;trate the faith of the United States to the will of the Legi&s;lature of this &s;tate, if they &s;hould refu&s;e to &s;urrender them, then the United States (without any fault on the part of the original &s;ub&s;cribers or the pre&s;ent holders) would not pay the intere&s;t they had i&s;&s;ued their obligation for, in which they promi&s;ed payment. It appeared to me that if &s;uch were the law
<PB N="222" REF="027132_0230_0FD350DACD8C6A10">
the public credit of the United States might be &s;haken by it and rendered precarious, but on turning to the law it will appear that the provi&s;ion for returning the certificates of the United States, was to prevent the United States from paying the intere&s;t twice on the &s;ame debt, and that in conformity thereto, if any of the certificates of this &s;tate commonly called New-Loan debt had been before the fir&s;t of October la&s;t, when the loan clo&s;ed, &s;ub&s;cribed to the &s;aid loan, it would have been requi&s;ite before the &s;tock had i&s;&s;ued therefor, that an equal &s;um &s;hould have been &s;urrendered by the &s;tate as afore&s;aid. <HI>The &s;tate would thus have redeemed her certificates through the United States in the &s;ame manner at pre&s;ent practi&s;ed, for individuals,</HI> but no &s;uch certificates of this &s;tate were &s;ub&s;cribed&mdash;con&s;e|quently the United States are entitled to none of the continental certificates, which are demandable by the per&s;ons holding the New-Loans. If they &s;hould be de|livered to the United States, this &s;tate might have to pay the New-Loan certificates without having this re&s;ource to do it with. I think too highly of the faith of the public to &s;uppo&s;e, that the holders of New-Loan are compellable either to &s;ub&s;cribe them to the United States or to re-exchange them for the continental certi|ficates, or that to &s;uch as do not, the &s;tate are ab&s;olved from payment both of principal and intere&s;t, but the market value and the irredeemable quality of the con|tinental &s;tock and the pre&s;ent funds of the United States are generally &s;ufficient to induce the change, as is evinced from the great quantity already &s;o exchanged, of the remainder &s;ome part is exchanged almo&s;t every day, and if the loan &s;hould be opened by Congre&s;s the exchanges would be encrea&s;ed thereby.</P>

<P>"THE &s;ubject committed to me by your excellency in December la&s;t, re&s;pecting the claim made by the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury to a &s;urrender on the part of the State, of the Continental certificates not exchanged, having been brought to a clo&s;e; and being this day in|formed at the Trea&s;ury that all ob&s;tacles were removed re&s;pecting the transfer and payment of intere&s;t quarterly on the a&s;&s;umed debt of this &s;tate, or the payment quar|terly to the &s;tate of the re&s;iduum un&s;ub&s;cribed of this &s;tate's quota; and orders having gone out to the Loan-Office of the di&s;trict of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> con&s;equent there|upon, I ha&s;ten to inform you thereof.</P>
<P>"The &s;ubject was an important one, and to have re|quired the Continental certificates from <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> while the New-Loans for which they were given were out, and the &s;tate re&s;pon&s;ible for, without the&s;e means of redemption, could have placed her in an unplea|&s;ant &s;ituation. To take off the appearance of this hard&s;hip, it was &s;ugge&s;ted, that in ca&s;e the New-Loans not exchanged, would not be &s;ub&s;cribed to the United States by the holders (which on the propo&s;ed terms of the loan might be done) yet &s;till that the &s;tate would by the terms of the &s;ame loan, be in the receipt of a &s;ufficient &s;um from the Union to meet the intere&s;t due to the&s;e creditors. But to this it was objected, that this receipt of intere&s;t by the &s;tate would be temporary, and would cea&s;e when the &s;ettlement of our accounts with the United States &s;hould be effected, and the ba|lances provided for agreeably to law, whereas the de|mand again&s;t the &s;tate would be perpetual, and could only be di&s;charged by payment of the debt.</P>
<P>"On the whole after much attention to this bu&s;ine&s;s it hath been &s;ettled to our wi&s;h; and the good &s;en&s;e of the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury hath led him to a deci&s;ion, under the Act of Congre&s;s of Augu&s;t 4th, 1790, which

<P>Mr. <HI>Morgan</HI> made &s;uitable remarks on the&s;e letters, and ob&s;erved that <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> had paid upwards of 63,000 dollars, and had nothing in return, and could not procure the Continental certificates. This act being done clande&s;tinely mu&s;t have a different con&s;truction than if it had been done openly.</P>
<P>The Comptroller-General obtained the money before the Governor or Regi&s;ter-General had any information of it: It was done in a way regardle&s;s of the checks of office. It was nece&s;&s;ary that New-Loans &s;hould be de|clared a&s;&s;umable before they were &s;ub&s;cribed, if there had been a full con&s;ultation it would &s;hew &s;ome degree of fairne&s;s. The Governor &s;hould be con&s;ulted if there &s;hould exi&s;t any difference of opinion between the Comptroller and Regi&s;ter-General.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> &s;hut the &s;ecret in his own brea&s;t, the dates of intere&s;t on the face of the ab&s;tracts were only inferences, and the Regi&s;ter-General did not know they were New-Loans.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Morgan</HI> read the warrant No. 462, by which Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> reduced the money into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the Regi&s;ter-General was not to blame as he did not enter into the calculations of ab&s;tracts.&mdash;Dates of intere&s;t and hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s might have induced him to overlook or not to have attended to this particular.</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="228" REF="027132_0236_0FD34FEB25658838">Here Mr. <HI>Morgan.</HI> remarked that the New-Loan cer|tificates were excluded.&mdash;If the&s;e two officers made a partial &s;tatement, they did not comply with the requi|&s;itions, it mu&s;t therefore be conceded that it included all: The act of the 10th of April, 1792, was their rule of con&s;truction. He then read the 2d &s;ection of that act. Mr. <HI>Morgan</HI> then held in his hand an ab&s;tract which had been actually redeemed, which did not on the face of it &s;hew the certification of the Comptroller for being <HI>genuine</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;umable,</HI> but it was in the hand writing of that officer, in the ab&s;tracts of others, it was nece&s;&s;ary, here it was not, the form is &s;imilar to the others; it con&s;i&s;ted of eight columns.&mdash;1. Date of cer|tificate. 2. Number of ditto. 3. By whom i&s;&s;ued. 4. To whom i&s;&s;ued. 5. Commencement of intere&s;t. 6. Amount of each certificate. 7. Intere&s;t computed to December 31, 1791. 8. Total amount.</P>
<P>In this ab&s;tract it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve that a certi|ficate purcha&s;ed from an irreproachable witne&s;s on the 7th of July, 1792 is contained in a receipt dated the 30th June, 1792, an erazure is made to cover purcha&s;es made after the fir&s;t of July, to bring them within the time pre&s;cribed by the act.</P>
<P>The foregoing were offered to &s;upport the three fir&s;t articles, the fourth is rather a deduction from them, he ob&s;erved that the three fir&s;t were con&s;idered together for they could not be &s;eparated.</P>
<P>He read the fourth article.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> he ob&s;erved, could not certify to the officers of the United States in his private capacity, he therefore did it under colour of his office, there was no &s;pecification of New-Loans on the face of the ab&s;tracts, and no fund provided to pay them, the money mu&s;t therefore have been drawn from the Trea&s;ury without any previous appropriation, or out of a fund otherwi&s;e appropriated, which is contrary to the con&s;titution; he quoted the 21&s;t &s;ection of the fir&s;t article of the con&s;ti|tution of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI> It is apparent from the&s;e facts and circum&s;tances that the Comptroller General knew
<PB N="229" REF="027132_0237_0FD350C11DBB38A8">
when he made the certification, and unle&s;s an appro|priation can be &s;hewn, it will not be di&s;puted that the New-Loans could be redeemed out of any other than the fund contemplated in the Act of the 10th of April, 1792. He repeated the reading of the &s;econd &s;ection, and &s;aid, that unle&s;s &s;ome other law can be &s;hewn, which he knew nothing of, there was no fund, the &s;ection men|tioned nothing of New Loans, nay it appropriates the funds and excludes New-Loans; the &s;ale of the three per cent. &s;tock was co-exten&s;ive with its object. If there|fore 986,000 dollars were only &s;ufficient, and part direct|ed for New-Loans, it would affect the other, and injure the proper &s;tate creditors; the honor of the &s;tate would be di&s;graced, as &s;he promi&s;ed payments and had not funds.</P>
<P>To prove that the money was reduced to Mr. <HI>Nichol|&s;on's</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he read the Governor's warrants, Num|bers 425, 451, and 462, July 9, 12, and 14, 1792.</P>
<P>The Trea&s;urer appeared with his books to &s;hew that the money was paid the 14th July, 1792, before the Regi&s;ter or the Governor knew any thing about the &s;ub&s;cribability of New-Loans.</P>
<P>The con&s;equences of this tran&s;action aggravate the crime, Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on's</HI> gain on the whole was about 14 or 15,000 dollars, and the commonwealth lo&s;t 25 per cent.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Morgan</HI> read the 5th article, ob&s;erving that he would &s;ub&s;tantiate the charge contained in this by re|&s;pectable witne&s;&s;es, they did not appear, and he moved for an adjournment, which was granted, with directions from the Speaker to be punctual.&mdash;The members of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives returned to their chamber, and repeated the ceremony, as in page 214 and 215.</P>
<P>The letter of Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> read ye&s;terday in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives (&s;ee page 200) was read the &s;econd time; and referred to Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>B. Morgan, M'Lene, Evans,</HI> and <HI>Bowman.</HI> It does not appear that they reported on it.</P>

<P>THE Senate met; and the members of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives in committee of the whole repaired to the Senate-chamber.</P>
<P>At 10 minutes after eleven o'clock Mr. <HI>Morgan</HI> ro&s;e, having premi&s;ed that his arguments the preceding days re&s;pected the fir&s;t, &s;econd, third and fourth articles of impeachment again&s;t the Comptroller-General, that he would then proceed in order to the fifth.</P>
<P>That he would &s;hew by the different &s;tatements of that officer to the Legi&s;lature in his official capacity, that he did not look upon New-Loan certificates as a State debt after the pa&s;&s;ing of the Act of March, 1789, as Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> made no mention of them in any of his communications.</P>
<P>That the Governor was of the &s;ame opinion.</P>
<P>The committees on Ways and Means of the &s;ame;</P>
<P>And the Legi&s;lature likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>That after the printed documents would be brought forward, he &s;hould then adduce oral te&s;timony. He read part of the State of the Finances of the common|monwealth as reported by Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> on the 7th November, 1787, in which Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> mentioned the New-Loans as an exi&s;ting debt again&s;t the &s;tate.</P>
<P>That in all his communications previous to March, 1789, the Comptroller mentioned the New-Loans as an exi&s;ting debt; and a total change of &s;entiment took place in him, in the Legi&s;lature, and Governor, after that period; becau&s;e they conceived the law of March, 1789, had done away the claim which exi&s;ted by the law of 1786, and the New-Loans were omitted in all their &s;ub&s;equent &s;tatements as no longer an object of Legi&s;lative con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="027132_0239_0FD350C6C9A39720">He ob&s;erved that the Governor in his &s;peech to the Legi&s;lature on the 10th December, 1791, did not men|tion New-Loans as a debt or claim on the &s;tate, and that he did not forget them, as he made mention of the payment of the arrears of intere&s;t due on them, for which provi&s;ion is made in the repealing act of March, 1789.</P>
<P>He read part of the Governor's &s;peech to both Hou&s;es on the 28th December, 1790, being the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion after the pa&s;&s;ing of the act of March, 1789, in which the Governor enumerated the aggregate of all the engage|ments of the commonwealth, and mentioned only the balance of intere&s;t due on the New-Loan debt; if they had been debts, he would not have executed his duty in omi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ting to &s;tate them, that funds might be provided by the Legi&s;lature for their redemption.</P>
<P>The &s;ame idea was pur&s;ued by the Governor in all his communications re&s;pecting the New-Loans.</P>
<P>The Comptroller-General him&s;elf, the committee on Ways and Means, and the other officers were of the &s;ame opinion. Mr. <HI>Morgan</HI> read part of the report of the committee on Ways and Means, Feb. 8th 1791, page 166 of the minutes, wherein the other debts of the commonwealth are mentioned and provided for, but not the New-Loans: Notwith&s;tanding this is called a &s;tatement of all the debts of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and added that every body put the &s;ame con&s;truction on that debt.</P>
<P>He read part of the &s;tatement of the Comptroller and Regi&s;ter-General of the 30th November, 1791, to the Governor, and ob&s;erved that the Governor and the Secretary were betrayed into the part they had acted, and for proof of which he would call witne&s;&s;es.</P>

<P>Soon after this the Comptroller and Regi&s;ter-Ge|neral joined in a report to the Governor on the &s;ubject, which the Governor peru&s;ed, approved, and &s;igned with the initials of his name; in con&s;equence of which indor&s;ement I returned it as an official document to the Comptroller or Regi&s;ter's office as their authority to act, I do not know to which of them, not by my&s;elf, but by one of my a&s;&s;i&s;tant clerks, whom I ordered to take it and deliver it with his own hands.</P>
<P>When the &s;ubject was before the Legi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ature, an enquiry was made for this document, and, I think, &s;ir, that application was made both to the Comptroller and Regi&s;ter to furni&s;h it, after &s;earch in their re&s;pective offices, they an&s;wered, it <HI>was</HI> not be found among their records.

my office, whether by &s;ome mi&s;take or other, it had not been &s;ent to the Comptroller or Regi&s;ter-General, after this &s;earch my mind was clear, that it had been tran&s;mitted to the officers above mentioned.</P>
<P>I wrote again by the direction of the Governor to the Comptroller-General and Regi&s;ter-General, (&s;ee page 226.)</P>
<P>On the 26th of the &s;ame month they united in a joint report to the Governor, (&s;ee page 227.)</P>
<P>Mr. Dallas <HI>ob&s;erved that he was not provided for being an evidence in this cau&s;e, that letters might be in his office, of which he might be totally ignorant, and if he &s;hould be unacquainted with &s;uch, or mi&s;taken in dates or numbers he hoped to he excu&s;ed, as he did not prepare him&s;elf to be a witne&s;s in this bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI> The la&s;t e&s;ti|mate corre&s;ponded with the fir&s;t, <HI>I &s;peak more from the conviction of my mind, than from the recollection of the document.</HI> The Comptroller and Regi&s;ter's fir&s;t e&s;timate, was dated before the 16th of April, 1792, which directed the mode of carrying the Act of the 10th of April, 1792, into execution, &s;uppo&s;ed to be lo&s;t.</P>

<P>On this conver&s;ation a conference took place con|cerning this matter, wherein I agreed with him in &s;en|timent, that the New-Loans were &s;ub&s;cribable, re|deemable, and embraced under the act of the 10th April, 1792.</P>

<P>In my conver&s;ation with the Comptroller we referred to the &s;everal acts of the United States and laws of this commonwealth, the only difficulty which occurred was the delivery of the Continental certificates for which the New-Loans had i&s;&s;ued&mdash;He an&s;wered it was a bu|ne&s;s of the United States, and that he either had, or would &s;ettle that bu&s;ine&s;s with the Secretary of the Trea|&s;ury

of the United States. He al&s;o avered that a per|&s;on (as a creditor) holding the certificate, had it in his power to do it, knowing that the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of intere&s;t was the only difficulty, and that that would only take place until certificates of the United States were ren|dered.</P>

<P>I therefore went to the Comptroller's office, met Mr. <HI>Reilly</HI> on the &s;tairs, and he returned with me to Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on's</HI> room.</P>
<P>I was informed more fully of the circum&s;tances by the Comptroller-General.

<P>Being then de&s;ired to proceed, he &s;aid, as it is a good while &s;ince the&s;e tran&s;actions had happened, and as my memory may fail, I had rather an&s;wer que&s;tions.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Oldden</HI> was then de&s;ired to inform the Senate what he knew about this bu&s;ine&s;s, or had you any New-Loan certificates in the year 1792?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Yes; on or about the 4th of July, 1792, I had a number, &s;uppo&s;e about &s;even or eight hundred odd pounds in New-Loan certificates, I, according to the u&s;ual practice made up an ab&s;tract, and took them to the Comptroller-General's office to be exchanged, pre|&s;ented the ab&s;tract and certificates in due form, and left them with the Comptroller as it was u&s;ual on &s;uch oc|ca&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;. by</HI> Mr. <HI>Lewis.</HI> For what purpo&s;e?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> After pre&s;enting them, I expected the original Continental certificates in lieu of them, I a&s;ked when I might get the Continental certificates, the an&s;wer, as well as I can recollect, was, that I &s;hould have them the next day about the &s;ame hour, it was then about 12 o'clock. I went up the next day&mdash;(Mr. <HI>Oldden</HI> was
<PB N="244" REF="027132_0252_0FD35091E683C1A8">
de&s;ired by Mr. <HI>Lewis</HI> to tell what pa&s;&s;ed in the mean time.) On the evening of the &s;ame day, I received a letter or note from the Comptroller, which note is lo&s;t, the purport of which was, that he would pay me an equal proportion and quantity of 6, 3, and deferred &s;tock, and arrearages of intere&s;t for them, take the certificates him&s;elf, and &s;ave me the trouble of funding the Continental ones.</P>
<P>To this note I returned no written an&s;wer, but told the bearer that I would &s;ee the Comptroller the next morn|ing and would complete and fini&s;h that bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;o the matter re&s;ted.</P>
<P>I &s;aw the Comptroller the next day, I fancy, it mu&s;t have been in the mean time, an idea &s;truck me, that he could pay them into the Land-Office, and intended to a&s;k him &s;omething more, don't know whether I went up twice or thrice, &s;till not ready; and when I did the la&s;t time, I told him, if he would give me thirty dollars beyond what their value was, as I &s;uppo&s;ed they would be of more u&s;e to him, he &s;hould have them. To this propo&s;al the Comptroller agreed, transferred the &s;tock to me at Mr. <HI>Smith's,</HI> and gave me a check on the Bank of the United States for 155 dollars and 85 cents, and 30 dollars for my good will of the certificates, being in the whole one hundred and eighty-five dollars and eighty-five cents.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;.</HI> When you offered the certificates to the Compt|roller for 30 dollars, did the Comptroller tell you it was too late?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I do not recollect, not certain, that any &s;uch thing was mentioned, it is a long time ago, the arrear|ages of intere&s;t and thirty dollars con&s;tituted the &s;um for which he gave me a check, and that was on the 7th of July, 1792, this I know from an entry in my memorandum book, the only written account, which I have of this tran&s;action.</P>
<P>The ab&s;tract No. 262, was looked for, found, and &s;hewed to Mr. <HI>Oldden,</HI> and he was de&s;ired to inform the Senate whether his certificates were in it; he directly

<P>SENATE met pur&s;uant to adjournment.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Morgan,</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Speaker and Gentlemen of the Senate,</HI></P>
<P>Having gone through the five fir&s;t articles of im|peachment again&s;t the Comptroller-General of this commonwealth, it now remains for me to go on to the 6th and 7th articles, to under&s;tand the&s;e two, a con&s;ide|rable &s;cale of important facts and corroborating te&s;ti|mony mu&s;t fir&s;t be attended to&mdash;If I have &s;hewn that the Comptroller's opinion was, long before the pa&s;&s;age of the Act of March 1789, that the New-Loans cea&s;ed to be a State debt, it will render his conduct more criminal, a retro&s;pective view of a pa&s;t tran&s;action will add &s;ome information to what has been already advanced: in one of his reports on the &s;tate of the finances, dated October 1, and December 11, 1790; he had &s;tated what debts were valid again&s;t the commonwealth and what were not.</P>
<P>Here Mr. <HI>Morgan</HI> read the report page 385, in the appendix to the minutes of 1790, containing what debts were to be di&s;charged, and what were valid, agreeably to the report of the proper officers; that the pre&s;ent con|&s;titution allowed of no draughts from the Trea&s;ury ex|cept by previous appropriations made by law. But in page 389 in the 7th article of the finances are &s;everal &s;ub|divi&s;ions, wherein the amount of the principal and in|tere&s;t of the New-Loans are defined, and excluded from redemption in the Land-office, whereby they cea&s;e to be and are no longer a debt of the &s;tate. This is ex|plained in expre&s;s terms, page 395 that New-Loans were then excluded. Here then we re&s;t our te&s;timony
<PB N="248" REF="027132_0256_0FD350DBF3B7E9F8">
of the five fir&s;t articles, the&s;e are objects of our accu&s;a|tion for plain and obvious rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>We now come to objects of greater moment, to im|peachments of a deeper dye, as the articles are of greater magnitude the puni&s;hment is to be &s;everer, ina&s;much as the Comptroller as a faithful guardian to pre&s;erve the property of the public, did not lay his hands on the trea&s;ures of the commonwealth, for the purpo&s;e of &s;av|ing the &s;ame, but made his official duty &s;ub&s;ervient to &s;peculation. If the te&s;timony already exhibited and arguments adduced, has made equal impre&s;&s;ion on the Senate as on the managers and on the Hou&s;e of Re|pre&s;entatives, who are his accu&s;ers, the articles of im|peachment will have the effect which the law and con|&s;titution require. <HI>(Here</HI> Mr. <HI>Evans a&s;&s;i&s;ted</HI> Mr. <HI>Mor|gan in arranging the papers and preparing the parts to be read.)</HI></P>
<P>Among the various per&s;ons who came to the Compt|roller's office to loan their certificates, we find the name of <HI>Hans Hamilton,</HI> in different progre&s;&s;ions, and if I am RIGHTLY INSTRUCTED it will be proved that Loan-office certificates of the United States and New-Loan certificates were depo&s;ited with Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> and both ultimately &s;ub&s;cribed to the Loan of the United States.</P>
<P>It remains with the Comptroller-General to account for that procedure, if the Act had required the &s;ame Continental certificates to be returned, the ca&s;e would be plain, and owing to the circum&s;tances of both, the New-Loans and the other certificates having been &s;ub&s;cribed by the &s;ame per&s;on a pre&s;umption is rai&s;ed; and he &s;hould &s;hew why they had not taken different cour&s;es. The moment that they cea&s;ed to be private property, they immediately became the property of the common|wealth, for the New-Loans and the Continental certifi|cates could not be public and private property at one and the &s;ame point of time, yet both have been &s;ub&s;cribed.</P>

<P>To prove that the Continental certificates thus depo|&s;ited exactly corre&s;ponded with the New-Loans, I have in my hand a certificate from the Regi&s;ter of the Trea&s;ury &s;igned by <HI>Jo&s;eph Nour&s;e,</HI> March 4th, 1794, by which it appears that the Comptroller-General had &s;ub&s;cribed by the Act of Augu&s;t 4, 1790, the certificates i&s;&s;ued as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>It thus appears, that the fir&s;t therein, corre&s;ponds ex|actly with the &s;econd in the other, in numbers, names, dates, commencement of intere&s;t, and total amount; the corre&s;pondence between them is be&s;t a&s;certained by going over the ab&s;tract, and examining the &s;ame, and, by comparing it with the Comptroller's books. I will now proceed to &s;hew the New-Loans were al&s;o &s;ub|&s;cribed&mdash;

<PB N="250" REF="027132_0258_0FD3503454B53948">
<HI>Hans Hamilton</HI> came forward and had New-Loans i&s;&s;ued for his Continental ones, two evidences of the &s;ame debt&mdash;this inconvenience would not have happened if the intention of the Legi&s;lature had been pur&s;ued. After the law of 1789 the New-Loans were only a receipt or claim to get back the Continental certificates; by this means a duplication of debt had been brought again&s;t the United States, contrary to what the Union and <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> had contemplated. This is the only te&s;timony now in our power, it remains with the Compt|roller-General to &s;hew and explain; it is manife&s;t that we had two debts in&s;tead of one, the certificates of the United States and tho&s;e of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> it is in his power to &s;atisfy the Senate if his books were kept in the manner in which they ought to have been&mdash;if this tran&s;action is not cleared up, the pre&s;umption is that &s;omething is unfair and unworthy of this officer.</P>
<P>To &s;hew however by as direct te&s;timony as the cir|cum&s;tance of this ca&s;e will admit that the Compt|roller-General has made u&s;e of certificates brought to, and depo&s;ited with him for re-exchange which he afterwards &s;ub&s;cribed to the Loan of the United States.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances which both points are briefly to prove, are the&s;e; that <HI>Matthew M'Connell</HI> furni&s;hed or &s;old a certificate for &pound;. 3275:19:4, to <HI>Blair M'Clena|chan,</HI> which is among tho&s;e &s;ub&s;cribed by Mr. <HI>Nichol|&s;on</HI> in his grand ab&s;tract. The pre&s;umptive te&s;timony will be &s;trong, that the Comptroller received this cer|tificate in his official capacity, and that he afterwards took it to his own u&s;e: The fir&s;t witne&s;s whom we &s;hall call on this &s;ubject is <HI>Matthew M'Connell.</HI></P>

<P>WE the &s;ub&s;cribers, appointed to take the an&s;wers of <HI>Blair M'Clenachan,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> on oath to &s;everal interrogatories committed to us in writing, to be propo&s;ed to him, rela|tive to an impeachment made before your honorable Hou&s;e by the honorable the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of the commonwealth afore&s;aid, again&s;t <HI>John Nichol&s;on,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Comptroller-General of the &s;aid commonwealth, do re&s;|pectfully certify that on this fir&s;t day of March, Anno Domini one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and ninety-four we repaired to the dwelling hou&s;e of the &s;aid <HI>Blair M'Clena|chan at Germantown,</HI> in the county of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and communicated to him the &s;everal interrogatories afore|&s;aid, which are hereunto annexed; and that the &s;old <HI>Blair M'Clenachan</HI> then and there, after having carefully and attentively read, examined and con&s;idered the &s;aid &s;eve|ral interrogatories, did on his &s;olemn oath on the Holy Evangeli&s;ts of Almighty God, to him by us duly ad|mini&s;tered, declare unto us his an&s;wers to the &s;aid &s;everal interrogatories in the words following&mdash;that is to &s;ay:&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Inter.</HI> 1. <HI>on behalf of the &s;tate.</HI> Were you at any time proprietor of a New-Loan certificate i&s;&s;ued by the State of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> to the amount of &pound;. 3275:19:4?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. It is probable that I had a certificate of that amount, but I cannot be certain thereof as I had &s;everal large ones, and did not make out any account or li&s;t of my certificates when I delivered them to Mr. <HI>Ni|chol&s;on;</HI> but it may probably be found on examining the books of Mr. <HI>Rittenhou&s;e,</HI> the late State-Trea&s;urer, what certificates I received intere&s;t on.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="027132_0262_0FD34FF51F955B90"><HI>Inter.</HI> 2. Did you &s;ell or lend &s;uch certificate or de|po&s;it &s;uch certificate, at any, and what time, with, or to <HI>Matthew M'Cornell?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 2. I never, to the be&s;t of my knowledge, either &s;old or lent to, or depo&s;ited with <HI>Matthew M'Connell</HI> a certificate of the amount of &pound;. 3275:19:4, but I did lend him a number of &s;mall certificates, (amounting in the whole to upwards of &pound;. 3000) a con&s;iderable time before I delivered my certificates to Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI>&mdash; my &s;on will furni&s;h you with the exact &s;um from a me|morandum made by me in a book at pre&s;ent in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 3. As I did not lend Mr. <HI>M'Connell</HI> a certificate of &pound;.3275:19:4 I could not receive one from him in return&mdash;the amount of the &s;mall certificates which I lent him, he did return to me.</P>
<P><HI>Inter.</HI> 4. Did you take &s;uch certificate to the office of the Comptroller-General for exchange pur&s;uant to Act of A&s;&s;embly of March 27, 1789?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 4. I took all the New-Loan certificates that I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed (which were to a very con&s;iderable amount) to the Comptroller-General and delivered them to him to be exchanged, without having made any li&s;t or ac|count of them.</P>
<P><HI>Inter.</HI> 5. Was &s;uch certificate exchanged by the &s;aid Comptroller-General, and did you receive in lieu thereof Continental certificates of equal value to the &s;ame as tho&s;e you originally loaned to the State?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 5. I received from the Comptroller-General Continental certificates, to the full amount (as I &s;uppo&s;e and as he informed me) of the New-Loan certificates which I had delivered him.</P>
<P><HI>Inter.</HI> 6. Did you ever &s;ell any certificates to <HI>John Nichol&s;on,</HI> the Comptroller-General or any other per&s;on?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 6. To <HI>John Nichol&s;on</HI> I never &s;old any certificate, to others I did &s;ell.</P>
<P><HI>Inter.</HI> 8, <HI>propo&s;ed on the part of the defendant.</HI> If the an&s;wer to the 4th interrogatory on the part of the com|monwealth &s;hould be in the affirmative, at what time did you take &s;uch certificates to the office of the Compt|roller-General for exchange pur&s;uant to the Act of A&s;&s;embly of 27th of March, 1789.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 8. I took no account of either the number or value of the certificates, nor of the time of delivering them.</P>
<P><HI>Inter.</HI> 9. If the an&s;wer to the fir&s;t part of the fifth interrogatory on the part of the pro&s;ecution &s;hould be in the affirmative, at what time was &s;uch certificate &s;o exchanged by the Comptroller-General?</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="027132_0264_0FD35078C83A3380"><HI>An&s;.</HI> 9. I cannot tell.</P>
<P><HI>Inter.</HI> 10. If the an&s;wer to the latter part of the fifth interrogatory afore&s;aid &s;hould al&s;o be in the affirmative, at what time or times did the &s;ame take place, and whether the certificates were received by you at one time or oftener, and whether the certificates you &s;o re|ceived were all tho&s;e for which your New-Loans had been originally granted, or whether they were all at the time of &s;uch delivery, and until received by you, the property of the State of Penn&s;ylvania, or whether any part of them were, or were not at the time, as afore|&s;aid, the property of Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 10. I do not recollect whether I received them all at one time or oftener.&mdash;Of the certificates dated between fir&s;t September 1777 and fir&s;t March 1778, I believe I received back the identical certificates for which New-Loan certificates had been granted&mdash;but as to tho&s;e of other dates, I cannot tell; and until I re|ceived tho&s;e certificates in exchange for the New-Loan certificates, I con&s;idered them as the property of the State, and no part thereof whatever as the property of <HI>John Nichol&s;on.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Inter.</HI> 11. If the an&s;wer to the 6th interrogatory &s;hould be in the negative, did you never <HI>barter</HI> nor <HI>commute</HI> with Mr <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> New-Loans for other cer|tificates, if you did &s;o barter or commute, &s;et forth the particulars at large how, when, and for what?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 11. I never bartered nor commuted with <HI>John Nichol&s;on</HI> any New-Loan or other certificates in the whole cour&s;e of my life.</P>
<P><HI>Inter.</HI> 12. Did you or did you not, and if &s;o at what time inform Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> that you wanted to rai&s;e &s;ome money out of certificates, but that you were determined not to part with the principal at le&s;s than 20&shilling; per pound, that you did not expect the intere&s;t or indents would appreciate &s;o much, and did you or did you not then a&s;k him to give you a &s;um in indents for &s;aid purpo&s;e, and if &s;o, how much and what amount of intere&s;t thereon, and where did this take place&mdash;and
<PB N="257" REF="027132_0265_0FD3505E9F3A27E8">
were there New-Loan certificates accompanied with the u&s;ual ab&s;tract or account for exchange, and did you, or did you not apply to Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> the &s;ame time for indents, before you received the Continental certifi|cates, and if &s;o at what time, and did he then give you a further &s;um of indents on account, and if &s;o what &s;um, on what account, and how did you di&s;po&s;e thereof.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 12. When I delivered my certificates to Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> there were many per&s;ons from the country at his office, de&s;irous of having their bu&s;ine&s;s &s;peedily done&mdash;I told Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> I was willing that the coun|try people &s;hould be fir&s;t &s;erved, and that he might &s;ettle mine at his lei&s;ure, but as that would probably take up &s;ome time, I reque&s;ted him to furni&s;h me in the mean time with &s;ome indents on account, to which he a&s;&s;ented, and I received indents from him at &s;everal times before I received the Continental certificates, but do not recollect the amount of the indents received at any one time, nor in the whole.</P>
<P><HI>Inter.</HI> 13. Did or did not he, Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> at your fir&s;t application mentioned in the la&s;t preceding inter|rogatory inform you, that if the &s;aid New-Loan certi|ficates were to be exchanged with the &s;tate you would have indents to pay and not to receive&mdash;and did he, or did he not &s;ay that he would notwith&s;tanding accom|modate you with the &s;um you wanted, in indents, on account of the &s;ame New-Loan certificates&mdash;and did he or did he not deliver you a &s;um at that fir&s;t time afore|&s;aid in indents, and if &s;o, how much and in what man|ner did you di&s;po&s;e thereof?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 13. On the final &s;ettlement of my account with the &s;tate, a balance of 4146 dollars and 24 cents in indents appeared again&s;t me, which in the &s;ummer of 1793 I reque&s;ted Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> to pay to the State on my behalf, and by his account rendered me, it appears that he has done it.</P>
<P><HI>Inter.</HI> 14. Did you or did you not at that time re|ceive the Continental certificates therefor equivalent, and did you or not at a &s;ub&s;equent period, and if &s;o
<PB N="258" REF="027132_0266_0FD3503CDD4393C0">
at what time thereafter apply at the office of the Comptroller-General with the remainder of your New-Loan certificates, and did or not the Comptroller-Ge|neral receive them, and &s;et down with you in his office and prepare an account thereof for exchange, and does the account numbered 1838, and 183, and 184, here|with pre&s;ented to you, appear to be the &s;ame accounts, and did you, or did you not then reque&s;t him to draw the indents for you, which after exchange would be receivable on your Continental certificates, and did you, or did you not receive tho&s;e certificates afterwards, and if &s;o, at what time?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 14. I recollect that I reque&s;ted Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> to draw the indents on my account from the United States, which he did, but the time I cannot recollect.</P>
<P>The remainder of this interrogatory is an&s;wered by my an&s;wer to the 10th interrogatory.</P>
<P><HI>Inter.</HI> 15. Did you, or did you not afterwards, and if &s;o at what time apply to Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> to pay in your behalf the balance of indents or 3 per cent. &s;tock, which &s;till remained due by you to the &s;tate on the exchange mentioned in the la&s;t interrogatory, and to what amount, and did he or did he not inform you he would do &s;o&mdash;and hath he or hath he not &s;ince ren|dered you an account thereof.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 15. The an&s;wer to this is contained in my an&s;wer to the two la&s;t preceding interrogatories.</P>
<P><HI>Inter.</HI> 16. Was there a con&s;iderable time between the time of exchanging and al&s;o between the time of fund|ing your different certificates&mdash;and if &s;o, how long?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 16. I cannot recollect.</P>
<P><HI>Inter.</HI> 17. Have you any account of your New-Loan certificates to which you can refer; or hath this tran&s;|action re&s;ted only on your memory&mdash;have you kept a regular account of your New-Loan certificates, and how, to whom and at what time, and for what were they di&s;po&s;ed of, if any, produce the &s;ame, and annex them to your an&s;wers.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="027132_0267_0FD35063C03FB498"><HI>An&s;.</HI> 17. I kept no account whatever of, or concern|ing my certificates.</P>

<P><HI>Inter.</HI> 19. Did you, or did you not at any time &s;ince you gave your te&s;timony on this &s;ubject to the late Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives expre&s;s to any per&s;on an idea that you had forgotten &s;aid te&s;timony, and your appre|hen&s;ion that if you &s;aid any thing on the &s;ubject, it might be incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;ome part of the evidence you had &s;o given?</P>
<P><HI>Inter.</HI> 20. Do you know in what manner you became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of each and every of your other New-Loan certificates, or any of them, if &s;o, name the certificates, of whom purcha&s;ed, or commuted, and when?</P>
<P><HI>Inter.</HI> 21. If the an&s;wer to the fir&s;t interrogatory be in the affirmative, when and of whom did you purcha&s;e the certificates therein mentioned, and how did you be|come po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed thereof?</P>

Were or were not the papers termed "exchanges" always filled up on &s;uch occa&s;ions? Did you on &s;uch occa&s;ions &s;ign a receipt in a book for the Continental certificates you received, do the exchanges annexed to the pre&s;ent interrogatories numbered 1838, 183, 184, contain an account of all the certificates ex|changed by you at the &s;aid office, or did you exchange others not included therein?</P>

<P>Upon the &s;econd reading of the report of the com|mittee on the mode of exchanging the New-Loan certi|ficates. It was re&s;olved that the following in&s;tructions be given to the Comptroller-General.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="027132_0275_0FD350DF73D91DF8">"SIR,</P>
<P>TO facilitate the exchange of certificates agreea|bly to Act of General A&s;&s;embly of the twenty-&s;eventh day of March la&s;t, Council have judged it proper to give you the following in&s;tructions, viz.</P>
<P N="1">"1. Every per&s;on who in conformity with the &s;aid Act &s;hall pre&s;ent to you a New-Loan certificate, may at his option receive from you the Continental certificate or certificates, for which the New-Loan certificate was granted, or receive a like &s;um of principal in certifi|cates of debts of the U. States, which have been paid into the Land-Office.</P>
<P N="2">"2. When New-Loan certificates have been cancel|led and &s;everal certificates have been by you given for the amount thereof, to enable the party to make pay|ment to the Land-Office, &amp;c.&mdash;and where one or more of the latter &s;hall be pre&s;ented as part or parts of &s;uch New-Loan certificate, the per&s;on pre&s;enting the &s;ame may in lieu thereof receive &s;o many of the original Continental certificates as &s;hall be equal to, or neare&s;t, it, and under the amount of the New-Loan certificates &s;o pre&s;ented.</P>
<P N="3">"3. In tho&s;e in&s;tances in which it may be impractica|ble for you to make the exact amount of a New-Loan certificate or certificates with Continental certificates, you will i&s;&s;ue a new certificate or certificates, bearing &s;imilar intere&s;ts for the balance or balances.</P>
<P N="4">"4th. In a &s;et of books to be prepared for the pur|po&s;e, you will keep exact and fair accounts of all cer|tificates you may receive, diliver or i&s;&s;ue, with their numbers, principal &s;ums and dates of intere&s;t.</P>
<P N="5">"5th. That the balance of intere&s;t to be received or paid by the &s;tate according to Act of A&s;&s;embly, may be a&s;certained, you will calculate the arrears of intere&s;t which may be due on all New-Loan certificates you may receive as well as on all Continental certificates you may deliver.</P>
<P N="6">"6th. You will receive indents or facilities for balances of intere&s;t as may be due to the &s;tate, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="268" REF="027132_0276_0FD3506541EAAD48">
of the indents or facilities you have received or may obtain from the United States, upon the Continental certificates in your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, you will pay &s;uch balan|ces of intere&s;t as may be due from the State.</P>
<P N="7">"7th. You will keep exact accounts of all indents &s;o received, in books prepared for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="8">"8th. If you con&s;ider it nece&s;&s;ary to your own &s;ecu|rity or to the regularity of your proceedings in the premi&s;es you will demand receipts from all per&s;ons to whom you may deliver certificates or indents as well as require vouchers of the certificates or indents which may be delivered or paid to you.</P>
<P N="9">"9th. In the fir&s;t Wednesday in every month you will produce to Council for their in&s;pection the books in which your tran&s;actions relative to the exchange of certificates according to Act of General A&s;&s;embly of the 27th day of March, 1789, are contained.</P>
<P N="10">"10th. If any difficulty or ob&s;truction &s;hould occur in the execution of the duties required of you by the Act above mentioned of the 27th day of March la&s;t, or by the foregoing in&s;tructions, you will repre&s;ent the &s;ame to Council, that &s;uch difficulty or ob&s;truction, if po&s;&s;ible, may be obviated or removed.</P>

<P>When or how impeachments began in England, or for what purpo&s;e, and whether this mode, like engines, are made u&s;e of for power or faction, is immaterial. Here they form a part of the Con&s;titution of this com|monwealth. There hereditary nobility command re&s;|pect. Here the Comptroller meets the charge, and he is to be tried by his peers. The tribunal is great, and the cau&s;e of importance. The defendant meets the im|peachment con&s;cious of his own innocence, he never &s;hrunk from it, he at fir&s;t propo&s;ed a que&s;tion to be ar|gued before the Supreme Court, (&s;ee page 82) he is
<PB N="269" REF="027132_0277_0FD350B9A38840A0">
impeached in the name of the people of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives is the grand inque&s;t of the nation. The Senate will judge without any regard to the impre&s;&s;ions made on the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives. The Comptroller is here in the &s;ame &s;ituation as any defendant in a common law court. The grand jury found the indictment, the Senate as a jury is &s;worn to try the indictment. Lord <HI>Mansfield's</HI> expre&s;&s;ion on this occa&s;ion is worthy of notice, That the juror's mind &s;hould be like <HI>"blank paper,"</HI> free from any impre&s;&s;ions but that of the evidence. That the late Hou&s;e of Re|pre&s;entatives and the Managers were actuated by the pure&s;t motives, and the pre&s;ent Hou&s;e al&s;o, I have no doubt, but from what &s;ource this impeachment &s;prings time only will di&s;cover. Public bodies are liable to be acted upon when the object in contemplation is to acquire public good or great public evil; the public good is a fa&s;cinating con&s;ideration to carry on a pro&s;e|cution. The good intentions of the Hou&s;e is not doubted, but this goodne&s;s might make them liable to be ea&s;ily acted upon. Popular bodies are ea&s;ily warped by an artful individual when he meditates the ruin of his neighbour, and impre&s;&s;es an idea on the A&s;&s;embly that he has the public good at heart.</P>
<P>Objections have been made again&s;t commonwealths and popular governments on this account&mdash;<HI>Socrates</HI> and <HI>Phocion,</HI> &s;ome of the greate&s;t men of antiquity, fell thro' the mi&s;taken zeal of popular bodies: no doubt the A&s;&s;emblies who convicted them, thought that they had condemned them for the public good; and now the&s;e A&s;&s;emblies are cur&s;ed and their memory held up to public execration. But no objection with us. The &s;ub|ject on which I have the honor to addre&s;s you, has not been very familiar to me, having no knowledge of it but what I collected &s;ince I have been retained by the Comptroller. Its branches are various, requiring much per&s;picuity and a thorough acquaintance with the &s;ub|ject. The Comptroller throws him&s;elf on the candor of his Judges, he has always acted from a proper con|&s;truction
<PB N="270" REF="027132_0278_0FD327EE837A03C0">
of the Act, or not. If he has, he cannot be guilty, and it is no proper &s;ubject of impeachment, if he had not, it is a &s;ubject of enquiry whether &s;uch con&s;truction was his known opinion or ba&s;ely contrived. If he put a bad con&s;truction on it, we &s;hould enquire, Whether the guilt is from the heart or from the head. The con&s;equences are removal from office, utter inca|pacity to hold any po&s;t of honor, profit, or tru&s;t&mdash;the charges ought to be clear and per&s;picuous&mdash;they are not &s;o per&s;picuous <HI>[the fir&s;t article read.]</HI> There is a point in this article that mentions he did &s;ub&s;cribe at <HI>various times.</HI> I do not know to <HI>whom,</HI> nor did I know till the opening, there are &s;ome certifications, but none in his own ca&s;e&mdash;&s;hould there be any ob&s;curity in our de|fence it is to be attributed to this, to whom did he declare them to be &s;ub&s;cribable? it wants certainty.</P>
<P><HI>[2d article read.] "Declare"</HI> without &s;aying to whom, total want of certainty, entirely omitting to whom or at what time.</P>
<P><HI>[3d read.]</HI> This wants certainty likewi&s;e as depend|ing on the fir&s;t and &s;econd, which are in their own na|ture, uncertain.</P>
<P><HI>The fourth</HI> article is &s;tated by the Manager as a deduc|tion from the former articles. If the former articles want certainty, this being deduced will con&s;equently be void of certainty likewi&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>The fifth</HI> is &s;o vague, it requires no comment.</P>
<P><HI>The &s;ixth</HI> read. I confe&s;s my&s;elf at a lo&s;s for the mean|ing of this charge, whether it is meant that Mr. <HI>Ni|chol&s;on</HI> took them without paying value for them, and then &s;ub&s;cribed them to the loan of the United States, or whether he did after lodgment pa&s;s value for them.</P>
<P><HI>The &s;eventh</HI> &s;tates more explicitly, but don't expre&s;s whether Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> paid value for them or not, an exchange is completed, and he &s;ub&s;cribed them, I &s;up|po&s;e they will explain them&s;elves by and by.</P>
<P>In charges of &s;uch &s;erious tendency, the particular objects &s;hould be pointed out&mdash;That certainty and per|&s;picuity which are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in indictments in com|mon
<PB N="271" REF="027132_0279_0FD350BC68A05460">
law courts not altogether requi&s;ite, that preci&s;ion and critical nicety required in the courts of Ju&s;tice would be too much in this particular, but the&s;e articles are too vague, too doubtful, too uncertain, we are not bound to an&s;wer the&s;e charges; the charge mu&s;t be de|finite and according to the laws of the land before it can be entitled to an an&s;wer. But we will, notwith|&s;tanding, proceed to an&s;wer them, and if the Compt|roller's judgment is right, this honorable court will not he&s;itate to pronounce him <HI>not guilty.</HI></P>
<P>Here Mr. <HI>Tilghman</HI> &s;hewed that the opinion of Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> was invariable as to the New-Loan certificates being a claim again&s;t the commonwealth, and that &s;e|veral other officers were of the &s;ame opinion&mdash;His opi|nion on opening the fir&s;t loan when he had no intere&s;t&mdash; when this &s;ubject was before the Legi&s;lature and never doubted until after the pa&s;&s;ing of the Act of the 10th of April, 1792&mdash;and for this purpo&s;e he cited the fol|lowing letters requiring and giving information on the &s;ubject of New-Loans.</P>

<SALUTE>"SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN con&s;equence of an enquiry made of me, I think nece&s;&s;ary to inform you that I con&s;ider the holders of certificates received from the government of any &s;tate, in lieu of certificates of the Federal debt, as having a right <HI>to &s;ub&s;cribe</HI> tho&s;e &s;tate-certificates to the loan of the a&s;&s;umed debt, and I con&s;ider the &s;tate as having a right to &s;ub&s;cribe the Continental certificates which they have obtained by the exchange, to the loan propo&s;ed by the Act of the 4th Augu&s;t, 1790; but <HI>no intere&s;t</HI> is to be paid on the a&s;&s;umed debt of the &s;tate, either to the &s;tate or to individuals, until you &s;hall be informed, that I am &s;atisfied, that all the certificates &s;o i&s;&s;ued by the &s;tate have been re-exchanged or redeemed, or that all tho&s;e, which &s;hall not be re-exchanged or redeemed, have been &s;urrendered to the U. S.</P>
<P>"To di&s;tingui&s;h in a clear and &s;triking manner this de&s;cription of New-Loan certificates from all others, I have determined to have a hole, of about one fifth of an inch, cut through a part near the center, being at the end of the blank left for the creditor's name im|mediately

before the word <HI>"is"</HI> and directly over the letter <HI>"t"</HI> in the word <HI>"amount."</HI></P>

<SALUTE>"SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are right in con&s;idering your&s;elf not autho|ri&s;ed by law to accept on the loan of the a&s;&s;umed debt certificates of the &s;tate of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> dated on or af|ter the fir&s;t day of January 1790. It is however my wi&s;h that you minute in a book to be kept for that pur|po&s;e the amount of &s;uch certificates offered by any per|&s;on, together with the name of the per&s;on offering them.</P>
<P>It will not be proper that you commit the examin|ation and checking of the certificates of the a&s;&s;umed debt to any per&s;on who does not actually belong to your
<PB N="274" REF="027132_0282_0FD350A3864F8A20">
office. It cannot be deemed a legal execution of your duty to rely upon any per&s;on not duly authori&s;ed. You will receive the&s;e certificates and give on the delivery of them to you, and before compari&s;on with the checks, a de&s;criptive receipt for them, which will amount to no more than an acknowledgment, that &s;uch certificates are placed in your hands with a view to the loan. The &s;ub&s;cribers will be &s;en&s;ible that the receipt cannot be deemed final, becau&s;e the &s;ub&s;criptions may exceed the a&s;&s;umption, and the certificates may prove counterfeit or forged. Having received them in the manner above mentioned, you will commit to &s;ome per&s;on competent to &s;o nice and important a bu&s;ine&s;s, the compari&s;on of the certificates with the regi&s;ters and checks in the of|fices of the &s;tate, to which no doubt the ea&s;ie&s;t acce&s;s will be given. Should however any unexpected impe|diment occur, you will make it known to me.</P>
<P>"I do not perceive any objection to your &s;triking a mark in the form you have exhibited (&ne;) upon all the certificates depo&s;ited with you towards the loan of the a&s;&s;umed debt, which however &s;hould be done in &s;uch manner as not to obliterate the printed or manu&s;cript words. You will be careful to &s;elect a proper place for the mark, which as far as po&s;&s;ible &s;hould be uniformly made, that the eye may in&s;tantly perceive it.</P>
<P>"I do not con&s;ider you as ju&s;tifiable in refu&s;ing the certificates of the &s;tate of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> (which are in all other re&s;pects a&s;&s;umable) becau&s;e they have been re|ceived of the &s;tate in lieu of Continental certificates. It will not however be improper to u&s;e your endea|vours to per&s;uade the holders to exchange them, but you cannot, if they per&s;i&s;t to offer, refu&s;e to receive them.</P>
<P>"You will perceive on re-examination that you have mi&s;conceived the in&s;truction contained in my letter of the 9th ult. in regard to Loan-office certificates i&s;&s;ued prior to March 1778. It applied to tho&s;e only pointed out in the 10th &s;ection, that is to the <HI>non-&s;ub&s;cribed,</HI> and not to tho&s;e that &s;hould be loaned. You will di&s;con|tinue

the practice of making &s;uch endor&s;ements on tho&s;e <HI>loaned,</HI> and you will, when transfers takes place of &s;uch &s;tock as has ari&s;en from loans of tho&s;e certificates take care not to make a &s;imilar endor&s;ement on the new cer|tificate to be given. I do not think any per&s;on mak|ing a loan has a right to do it in any other manner than that which is deemed to be perfectly conformable with the law.

<P>I recollect there were &s;everal conferences between the Comptroller-General and my&s;elf, am unable to di&s;tingui&s;h with preci&s;ion the one alluded to, I recollect one interview in particular in which this point was di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed, that is, whether intere&s;t on the &s;tate debt &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended. I really charge my memory with nothing more than, that Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> urged arguments to induce me to believe that the &s;pirit of that part of the Act of Congre&s;s was only to prevent the payment of
<PB N="288" REF="027132_0296_0FD3519384B5F690">
double intere&s;t, and that a &s;urrender was neither practi|cable nor equitable, <HI>(&s;ee page</HI> 220-1-2-3-4); as none of the&s;e had been &s;ub&s;cribed, this inconvenience could not ari&s;e, the intention of the Act of Congre&s;s was fulfilled, I was convinced the rea&s;oning was ju&s;t, there being no ba&s;is on which the U. S. could demand a &s;urrender.</P>
<P>If the New-Loans in my view of them <HI>at that time</HI> had not been &s;ub&s;cribable, this difficulty could not have ari&s;en. The Comptroller always appeared to me to be of the opinion that they were &s;ub&s;cribable&mdash;none were &s;ub&s;cribed in the former loan. The enquiry whether any had been &s;ub&s;cribed to the loan was directed to the com|mi&s;&s;ioner of loans, the information mud ultimately have come from him&mdash;Mr. <HI>Wolcott</HI> might have been the in|termediate agent, I can't remember.</P>

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I can't without previous preparation an&s;wer that enquiry, I could have ea&s;ily a&s;certained it, I do not re|collect, my conjecture is that there were none, there were &s;ome certificates of that de&s;cription which were not finally admitted. I recollect there were &s;ome di&s;|cu&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;.</HI> Are they entirely rejected or are they depending?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> They took a cour&s;e &s;omewhat peculiar, in the view of the Trea&s;ury they are virtually excluded, the time allowed for the loan being pa&s;&s;ed; after the At|torney-General's opinion on a point rai&s;ed they were not admitted, this point aro&s;e after the &s;econd loan open|ed. The &s;ubject had not engaged my con&s;ideration, nor did it come forward in a <HI>prominent point of view</HI> until after the &s;econd a&s;&s;umption. The Attorney-Ge|neral of the &s;tate of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> gave his opinion that they are aboli&s;hed, as debts of this &s;tate. I may have read the Act of March 1789, but I do not recollect having &s;een it until after the clo&s;ure of the fir&s;t loan. I did not &s;ee that Act during the fir&s;t conferences.</P>

Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> ob&s;erved that the &s;ection was more general than he at fir&s;t thought, or intended it, and that it would embrace unfunded depreciation, don't recollect that any conver&s;ation took place, nor difference of opinion about that law until after the &s;ub&s;cription of New-Loans, when we had a conference, and we agreed in opinion that they were &s;ub&s;cribable and a&s;&s;umable. No other conver&s;ation about them until the conference above|mentioned. I recollect the letter of the 13th of April 1792, re&s;pecting the &s;ale of &s;tock. But as to that &s;aid to be lo&s;t, in my letter book there is no reference to &s;uch a letter, I have been much perplexed about it, &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed that there had been &s;uch a letter, but cannot account for it, and doubt whether there was any as it is not on my books. When the committee on Ways and

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Yes; dates of intere&s;t on New-Loans com|menced at mixt and different dates. The date of the commencement of intere&s;t on funded and depreciation debt on fixt and particular dates. Funded debt fir&s;t of January, fir&s;t of July, depreciation 10th April, 10th of October.

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> We deemed that clau&s;e would extend to every thing Congre&s;s would redeem, the whole unfunded depreciation, nay every &s;pecies of debt. But bills of credit and unfunded depreciation were particularly mentioned.</P>

<P>Having examined a number of witne&s;&s;es and read many documents to &s;hew that our con&s;truction of the Act is con&s;onant to law, and that the defendant's opinion and judgment was the legal one, I will only examine one or two more to the &s;ame point.&mdash;In order to &s;hew this more fully I will quote the Governor's words in the minutes of the A&s;&s;embly, 10th December, 1791, page 12, where his words allude to the payment of arrears due not on New-Loan certificates but "on the New-Loan debt." Where they are quoted, they are &s;tiled New-Loan

certificates. The rea&s;on why the New-Loans are not &s;tated as a debt to be paid, is becau&s;e the common|wealth thought &s;he had a fund in her hands equivalent to an&s;wer them at any time, the State and her officers con|ceived they had a fund, commen&s;urate to their redemp|tion, either when the party &s;hould come to exchange, or when future provi&s;ion &s;hould be made by the Legi&s;|lature. The word <HI>"redeemed,"</HI> minutes, page 389, 1791, &s;o much relied on, alluded only to the Land-Office. Page 421, the Regi&s;ter-General heads the title "New-Loan Debt."

<P><HI>Que&s;.</HI> We wi&s;h to know if you had any conver&s;ation with Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> about the Act of the 10th of April 1792&mdash;the purport, time, &amp;c.?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I have under&s;tood that tho&s;e were the points to which I &s;hould give evidence, and I have ju&s;t &s;ent for the minutes of 1791 to whet my recollection as my me|mory is imperfect at this time. <HI>[Gets the books.]</HI> The only difficulty I have is, the date of the conver&s;a|tion, I do not recollect that very well, whether before the bill was reported, or while the report of the commit|tee on ways and means was before the Hou&s;e&mdash;the im|port of the conver&s;ation was that Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> had an objection, he gave me his plan, and reque&s;ted me to give my opinion, the plan before the Hou&s;e was to re|deem the debts, his plan did not propo&s;e a redemption but commutation with an irredeemable quality. I thought the redeeming plan better and therefore did not approve and I returned him his plan. Another cir|cum&s;tance, After I returned the plan to Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> the Secratary of the commonwealth &s;hewed me that plan or a copy of it, and reque&s;ted me to look at it, and that Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> reque&s;ted the Governor to re|commend it to the Legi&s;lature, the bill agreeably to the report of the committee of Ways and Means was
<PB N="296" REF="027132_0304_0FD3514900B5A400">
then under the con&s;ideration of the Legi&s;lature, I told Mr. <HI>Dallas</HI> that I had &s;een it before, and di&s;approved of it, and told him the Governor had better examine the plan, and not &s;end it except he approved of it.</P>
<P>After the bill pa&s;&s;ed; and the Hou&s;e adjourned. I was in the Comptroller's office; the conver&s;ation turned on the po&s;&s;ibility of carrying the Act into execution, &s;e|&s;everal difficulties aro&s;e, and objections were &s;tarted, on account of the price of &s;tock in the market being lower than the price limited in the Act, and propo&s;itions were made to get over the difficulty. Al&s;o whether a part of the 3 per cent. &s;tock &s;hould be &s;old or the whole at once; I was afraid the whole plan would be de|feated. The&s;e objections were rai&s;ed by the officers. The defendant &s;ugge&s;ted that by the law unfunded de|preciation certificates were redeemable, altho' the Legi&s;|lature perhaps might not intend it: That it appeared to him unfunded depreciation was redeemable, altho' the report excluded them. Upon that Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> &s;hewed me the 6th &s;ection, I a&s;&s;ented to what he &s;aid, and &s;aid that I thought the unfunded certificates were included in that &s;ection. I added that I had drawn the bill my|&s;elf, and had made the 6th &s;ection a <HI>provi&s;o</HI> to the &s;e|cond; expre&s;sly providing for the redemption of cer|tain certificates therein defined, which would put the thing beyond di&s;pute, becau&s;e the &s;econd &s;ection defin|ed the thing to be redeemed, that the <HI>provi&s;o</HI> was made a di&s;tinct &s;ection out of the Hou&s;e; as &s;ome kind of provi&s;o, always con&s;idered in the Hou&s;e, but a&s;&s;ented at the &s;ame time that the con&s;truction would extend to unfunded depreciation. I had no time to form an opi|nion, it was of the moment, on the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion. I al&s;o added that it was very immaterial to the &s;tate to re|deem this way, or by the Land-Office, the price being at that time nearly the &s;ame as ca&s;h.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The defendant refers to the price-current of the brokers to prove that the price of New-Loans in the market was then as high as unfunded Depreciation certificates.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Donnald&s;on</HI> was pre&s;ent the whole or mo&s;t of the time.

At the next meeting of the Le|gi&s;lature on my return to the city, I was a&s;toni&s;hed to hear that New-Loans were redeemed&mdash;I had a &s;mall New-Loan certificate from Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s,</HI> which I kept pretty late, don't know whether before or after the law pa&s;&s;ed, I gave it to the Comptroller to exchange it, he &s;aid he was hurried, he would get it exchanged and &s;ub&s;cribed and give me the parts; he gave me a re|ceipt for the New-Loan. I do not know the time, it was about May, it was not completed at the end of April, I left town with that receipt in my pocket, which I gave to Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s,</HI> I know I had no idea of their being of any other u&s;e than for the purpo&s;e of exchange, if I had thought they were redeemable, I would enquire and do the be&s;t for him who employed me.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;.</HI> Did you not give an opinion that whatever were &s;ub&s;cribable, were redeemable?</P>

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> A day or two after the adverti&s;ement was pub|li&s;hed, I &s;taid in town ten days after the Hou&s;e had ad|journed, the adverti&s;ement was put into the public pa|pers before I left town, the &s;ale of &s;tock was the 16th April&mdash;the &s;um to be &s;old was 986,000 dollars.

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> That was not mentioned, if it was I did not a&s;|&s;ent.

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Yes.

<P><HI>Que&s;.</HI> Did you &s;ub&s;cribe any New-Loans to the &s;tate loan of the United States?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Yes; about the latter end of June or begin|ning of July 1792, I was a&s;ked for New-Loan certifi|cates, I a&s;ked what they would give me, they &s;aid 6 or 7 pence more than for final &s;ettlements, I had none then, but from this circum&s;tance I was induced to try to find out what they wanted to do with them. After reading the Act of Congre&s;s of 4th of Augu&s;t 1790, a&s;&s;uming &s;tate debts, and the Act of this &s;tate which was pa&s;&s;ed in April 1792, it was my opinion they were a&s;&s;umable, and in con&s;equence I purcha&s;ed and &s;ub&s;cribed part on my own account and part on account of another per&s;on, none on Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on's</HI> account, I can't tell who came to me, I made an ab&s;tract, carried it to Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> he certified them <HI>genuine</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;umable,</HI> they were not redeemed as the bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;topped.</P>

<P>It appears al&s;o that Judge <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> was making a &s;e|cond &s;ub&s;cription, it is pre&s;umable that he knew the law.

</LETTER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tilghman.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Before I proceed to the next head, I will remark that the &s;tate ought to pay the full amount, that the New-Loans were &s;ub&s;cribable and redeemable, and con&s;e|quently the &s;tate ought to pay pound for pound, and really the complaint again&s;t the Comptroller is of an extraordinary nature&mdash;<HI>"Mr. Nichol&s;on acquired wealth that the &s;tate ought to have got!"</HI>&mdash;I fancy if any que&s;|tions ought to be rai&s;ed, it ought not to be between the commonwealth, but between the per&s;ons from whom Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> bought, he however bought fairly. I now come to the Acts of A&s;&s;embly, and I will &s;hew that the con|&s;truction drawn by the managers, is injurious and dero|gatory, and I hope to &s;hew Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on's</HI> con&s;truc|tion to be con&s;onant to good faith, honor and equity. If the law is to receive their con&s;truction, it will oppo&s;e the Federal Con&s;titution, which is the &s;upreme law of the land; and therefore it is utterly void.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="027132_0310_0FD3514C4CEE68D8">My po&s;itions are, that New-Loans were &s;ub&s;cribable to the fir&s;t loan, al&s;o to the &s;econd, and likewi&s;e redeem|able under the &s;ixth &s;ection of the Act of the 10th April 1792.</P>
<P>(Here Mr. <HI>Tilghman</HI> read the 3d, 7th and 11th &s;ections of the Act of March 1, 1786, to prove that New-Loans were as much a debt as any other.) No matter whether the commonwealth became immediately indebted or thro' the agency of others. Temporary provi&s;ion is not apparent from the Act. If the com|monwealth entertained temporary views they were not mutual. Mutuality and reciprocity are the e&s;&s;ence of contracts. Whatever is rea&s;onable with private per&s;ons in the ca&s;e of contracts is &s;o with the State.</P>
<P>But it hath been contended that the Act of March 27 1789, puts the&s;e certificates into an ambiguous &s;tate; let us examine the Act it&s;elf&mdash;"Whereas the duties on ex|ports and impo&s;ts are given to Congre&s;s&mdash;<HI>temporary</HI> relief &mdash;it became inconvenient to pay half-yearly, &amp;c."&mdash;this Act does not compel an exchange, it leaves it optional; perhaps the commonwealth could not pay, what then ought to be done?&mdash;we will give you an option. You are our creditor; we have contracted to pay you prin|cipal and intere&s;t; we will pay you four year's intere&s;t becau&s;e we are able to do &s;o, and we will give you back your original certificate at your option, or we will pay you when we can.</P>
<P>The 3d &s;ection did not contemplate that all would exchange, and it implies too much inju&s;tice and im|propriety to pre&s;ume they meant to ab&s;olve them&s;elves from the payment of the remainder; "MANY," is a rela|tive term, it does not imply a majority, it means &s;ome may, others would not.</P>
<P>Under the con&s;truction of the Managers the New-Loan holder is a creditor of nobody; but po&s;&s;ibly or probably may become the creditor of the Continent. Notwith&s;tanding the time of payment is altered, yet the State holds the value in her hands and continues no debtor. How can &s;uch a con&s;truction be put on this
<PB N="303" REF="027132_0311_0FD35180B9F7E3B8">
Act without flying in the face of the Federal Con&s;titu|tion&mdash;(Section 10 of the fir&s;t article is cited,) Congre&s;s in the ninth &s;ection of the &s;ame article is denied the power of making <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> laws.</P>
<P>This is the la&s;t of all &s;uppo&s;able ca&s;es, by this Con|&s;titution no State can pa&s;s a law impairing the obligation of contracts made between A and B, con&s;equently a State cannot do it, when &s;he is a contracting party.</P>

<P>I had been in the practice of frequently bringing New-Loans to the Comptroller-General's office to be exchanged.

<P>We conver&s;ed on the &s;ubject and both agreed that it would not be for the intere&s;t of the State, and that it would be better if the Act did not pa&s;s.

The in|ference thence drawn is that the New-Loans were fir&s;t exchanged and then &s;ub&s;cribed, we are not charged with having mi&s;applied the Continental certificates, the charge mu&s;t be that the New-Loans were exchanged and then &s;ub&s;cribed, but this by no means appears, nor was it the ca&s;e, as we &s;hall prove by the te&s;timony of <HI>Hans Hamilton</HI> him&s;elf, that Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> purcha&s;ed tho&s;e New-Loans of him.</P>

It was paid out of the &s;ale of &s;tock. I find by my report, that my e&s;timate to the Governor did not include them.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Tilghman.</HI> I acknowledge that the depo&s;ition cannot be admitted agreeably to the &s;trict rules of evi|dence.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Senate,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE order which as Coun&s;el for the defendant I &s;hall ob&s;erve in replying to the articles of impeachment, will conform to that pur&s;ued in the arrangement of the arti|cles them&s;elves. I &s;hall accordingly begin with the fir&s;t which appears of the greate&s;t importance, and &s;erves as an introduction to the others.</P>
<P>This article, after declaring that the New-Loans cea&s;ed to be a State-debt on the pa&s;&s;ing of the Act of March 1789, charges the defendant with certifying them to be &s;ub&s;cribable to the loan of Congre&s;s as debts of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> contrary to his official tru&s;t, and as he well knew to the manife&s;t injury of the commonwealth.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;tantial part of the article con&s;i&s;ts in the po|&s;ition that the New-Loans were not State debt after March 1789, nor of cour&s;e &s;ub&s;cribable to the loan, and grounds on this ba&s;is the &s;ub&s;equent charge of guilt in the defendant in declaring them to be &s;ub&s;cribable.</P>
<P>To a&s;certain the weight of this po&s;ition it will be nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;cend to the origin of the&s;e certificates, and to trace them from that time to the period men|tioned in the article.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="027132_0325_0FD350F17A239F08">The&s;e certificates are derived from the Act of the 1&s;t March 1786. Vol. 2. p. 417.</P>
<P>This Act after mentioning the occa&s;ion of pa&s;&s;ing it, directs the mode of i&s;&s;uing the certificates and places them upon the &s;ame footing with the mo&s;t favored cer|tificates of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ection declares "it is ju&s;t and proper that the patriotic citizens of this State, who in the late arduous conflict, yielded their property and their per|&s;onal &s;ervices to the public u&s;e, and thereby eminently contributed to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the peace, liberty, and &s;afety, of the United States of America, &s;hould be relieved, as far as circum&s;tances will admit, from bearing an undue proportion of the public burthen, which ought to re&s;t equally on all the citizens." The &s;econd proceeds to direct blank certificates to be pro|cured, and pre&s;cribes the form, viz. The common|wealth of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> has received on loan from  <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">  the  <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">  of  <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">  to be paid to the &s;aid  <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">  or bearer on or before the fir&s;t day of March in the year of our Lord one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and ninety-&s;ix, with intere&s;t from the  <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">  day of  <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">  at the rate of &s;ix per centum per annum to be paid half-yearly at the State-Trea&s;ury according to the directions of an Act of the General A&s;&s;embly, pa&s;&s;ed on the  <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">  day of  <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word"> . The third directs the loan to be opened, to continue &s;o two years, and regulates the dates of the certificates to be i&s;&s;ued. The fourth di&s;tingui&s;hes the kinds of Continental certificates to be received. The &s;ixth and &s;eventh mention that certain Continental Loan-office certificates i&s;&s;ued between 1 Sept. 1777 and 1 March 1778 are &s;ubject to liquidation by the &s;cale of depreciation on their final redemption, altho' the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors are entitled to receive the annual intere&s;t at full value on the nominal &s;um until &s;uch redemption takes place, and direct a reference to the&s;e certificates to be made on the New-Loans i&s;&s;ued therefor; that on the payment of the <HI>principal</HI> they may be &s;ubject to the &s;ame liquidation.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="027132_0326_0FD3518F012676D0">The other &s;ections provide for the payment of the intere&s;t on the New-Loans half-yearly&mdash;make them redeemable at the Land-office&mdash;provide for the Conti|nental certificates received and for conducting the loan.</P>
<P>A Supplement to this Act was pa&s;&s;ed 28th March 1787, p. 508, extending the loan to tho&s;e citizens who had made loans in the Continental Loan-offices of <HI>De|laware</HI> and <HI>New-Jer&s;ey.</HI></P>
<P>From the whole complexion of this Act it appears that the Legi&s;lature con&s;idered the certificates i&s;&s;ued in pur&s;uance of it, or in other words the New-Loans, as effectually State debt, as tho&s;e of any other de&s;cription. For they on the face of the certificate promi&s;e to pay the principal on or before the year 1796, and the in|tere&s;t half-yearly until that time. The Land-office is open for their reception as for other certificates; and tho&s;e which were peculiarly &s;ituated as already mention|ed, are directed to be reduced to &s;pecie value on the payment of the principal.</P>
<P>The merit of the holders of the&s;e certificates was equally great, with the holders of any other. The debts were contracted in a common cau&s;e&mdash;the citizens of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> were the creditors, and the State her|&s;elf enjoyed in common with the other States, the bene|fits of their exertions.</P>
<P>That the provi&s;ion made in this Act was de&s;igned to be permanent, and the New-Loan creditors con&s;idered by our Legi&s;lature of the mo&s;t meritorious cla&s;s, will appear in the &s;tronge&s;t manner by referring to a re&s;olu|tion of the Legi&s;lature upon this &s;ubject on the 27th December 1786, Minutes of A&s;&s;embly, p. 97.</P>
<P>This re&s;olution took place upon a very pre&s;&s;ing oc|ca&s;ion&mdash;Congre&s;s being much embarra&s;&s;ed, appointed a committee to di&s;clo&s;e to our Legi&s;lature the urgent &s;tate of their affairs, and to reque&s;t an immediate grant of the impo&s;t to enable them to comply with the en|gagements of the Union.&mdash;The Legi&s;lature after paying all the attention due to the importance of the occa&s;ion, re&s;olve in words as &s;trong as language can expre&s;s, that
<PB N="319" REF="027132_0327_0FD327F1682121E0">
their engagements to their own citizens prevent them without a breach of good faith from complying with the reque&s;t, at the &s;ame time informing Congre&s;s of their unfeigned regard for the honor of the United States, and of their unremitted exertions to do all in their power to &s;upport it. (The report is as follows.)</P>
<P>"The report of the committee to whom was referred the report of the committee of the late Hou&s;e of A&s;|&s;embly, appointed to confer with the honorable Mr. <HI>Monroe</HI> and Mr. <HI>King,</HI> read December 15th, was read the &s;econd time, and adopted as follows, viz.</P>
<P>"The committee, to whom was referred the report of a committee of the late Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, appoint|ed to confer with the honorable Delegates on their mi&s;&s;ion from Congre&s;s, beg leave to report&mdash;</P>
<P>"That they have examined the object of the &s;aid report with the attention due to its importance:</P>
<P>"That they cannot help con&s;idering the debt of the United States in one aggregate point of view, and are of opinion that the principles of ju&s;tice require like payment of every part, whether the &s;ame be due to foreigners or citizens:</P>
<P>"That there appears to have been due to the citizens of this commonwealth a &s;um which &s;he has undertaken to pay them, and which probably amounts nearly to her proportion of the whole debt.</P>
<P>"That the appropriation of funds for that purpo&s;e is of &s;uch nature, that the report now referred to your committee (and which was adopted by the la&s;t A&s;&s;em|bly) declares, "an immediate compliance with the re|commendation would involve a breach of the faith of this &s;tate, pledged to the public creditors, citizens thereof, unle&s;s at the &s;ame time &s;ome further and other funds were provided for payment of the intere&s;t due and which &s;hall become due to them:"</P>
<P>"That in the opinion of your committee, the mag|nitude of the appropriation ju&s;t mentioned renders the provi&s;ion alluded to in the report impracticable.</P>
<P>"That in the opinion of your committee, it would
<PB N="320" REF="027132_0328_0FD3517172453B70">
neither be ju&s;t nor prudent to call on the citizens of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> for payment of taxes, to di&s;charge the money due to others, while that which is due to them|&s;elves is unprovided for.</P>
<P>"Your committee therefore propo&s;e the following re&s;olution:</P>
<P>"That the Delegates of this State in Congre&s;s be in&s;tructed to a&s;&s;ure the United States of the &s;incere de|&s;ire of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> to make an adequate provi&s;ion for all the debts of the Union; that this de&s;ire, fully evinc|ed by her ready compliance with pa&s;t requi&s;itions, will equally operate on future determinations; that the di&s;|tre&s;s of her citizens, to whom large &s;ums were due, and who were at the &s;ame time compelled to pay their proportion of &s;upplies for the current expenditures, called loudly for relief; that having waited in vain for a general a&s;&s;ent to the mea&s;ures propo&s;ed by Congre&s;s, until the grievance complained of could no longer be borne, it became nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;ume the payment of tho&s;e &s;ums which were due by the Union to her own citizens; that in con&s;equence, the funds now required by the United States were appropriated to this object, and the debts due to individuals were transferred to the State, whereby <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> became the creditor of the Union; that this Hou&s;e cannot divert the funds &s;peci|fied from the appropriation formerly made, until &s;uch &s;olid provi&s;ion be made for all the public debts, as that the annual intere&s;t payable to <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> will be a certain and &s;ufficient fund for di&s;charging tho&s;e &s;ums, which &s;he is bound in the manner abovementioned to pay to her citizens, but that <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> will in the mean time account for her full quota of the &s;ums ne|ce&s;&s;ary to di&s;charge the intere&s;t, and in&s;talments of principal, due or to become due by the United States, and, after deducting therefrom the intere&s;t &s;he is en|titled to receive, will regularly pay any balance that may remain due on &s;uch quota."</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation the New-Loans continued; a debt deliberately formed, and &s;anctioned by this re&s;olution,
<PB N="321" REF="027132_0329_0FD3519E07C132F0">
until the Act of the 27th of March 1789, p. 694, which it is contended has de&s;troyed the debt.</P>
<P>It may be proper to glance at the &s;ituation of affairs at the time of pa&s;&s;ing this Act, before we proceed to con&s;ider the Act it&s;elf. For by &s;eeing how far the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of the times required an alteration, and what alteration was requi&s;ite to an&s;wer and remove that ne|ce&s;&s;ity, we obtain a good criterion to determine the true intent of the law;&mdash;as the fir&s;t mu&s;t have been the cau&s;e inducing the Legi&s;lature to pa&s;s it, and the la&s;t the object de&s;igned to be accompli&s;hed by its pa&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>It appears then that by the Act of March 1786, the Legi&s;lature freely and openly e&s;tabli&s;hed the loan upon permanent and liberal principles, that they had con&s;titut|ed a debt, which they con&s;idered them&s;elves <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> bound to di&s;charge, and which they could not, con&s;i&s;t|ently with good faith attempt to injure. In the year 1789, from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Federal Con&s;titu|tion, Congre&s;s became entitled to the impo&s;t, and the State was in con&s;equence deprived of her mo&s;t u&s;eful and productive revenue, and was utterly unable without additional taxes, to di&s;charge the annual demands, The&s;e additional taxes it would be too burthen&s;ome at this time to levy, as the citizens exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e they paid in common, were then paying an annual land tax of &pound;.76,000; many of the former were greatly in arrear, and of cour&s;e no additional one would be punc|tually complied with. The be&s;t mode that occurred to remove the&s;e difficulties was to &s;u&s;pend the payments of the New-Loan debt, which from its greater magni|tude pre&s;&s;ed harder man any other. The &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the principal (which might ea&s;ily be done as the pay|ment could not be exacted by the contract before 1796) immediately clo&s;ed the Land-office again&s;t it, which in con&s;equence became a more productive fund for the redemption of the other debt, and together with the pre&s;ent &s;toppage of the intere&s;t, would remove the em|barra&s;&s;ment occa&s;ioned by the lo&s;s of the impo&s;t. As Congre&s;s would probably provide for the public debts,
<PB N="322" REF="027132_0330_0FD35156F72C1988">
being con&s;titutionally authori&s;ed to do &s;o, it would be but fair to permit the&s;e creditors to enjoy the benefits of &s;uch provi&s;ion, as a compen&s;ation for the lo&s;s now &s;uffered, and to enable them to become Continental creditors for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>That this was the intention of the Legi&s;lature we may not only pre&s;ume from adverting to the &s;ituation of the times, but it al&s;o appears from the complexion of the Act it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ection which con&s;titutes a lengthy preamble, recites the Act of March 1786, with its &s;upplement, and &s;tates the actual &s;ituation of things. That Congre&s;s have power to provide for the public debts; that they have become entitled to the impo&s;t, which the State con&s;equently lo&s;es; that the aggregate fund, out of which the New-Loans were paid is dimini&s;hed by the withdrawing of the impo&s;t; that Congre&s;s will no doubt provide for the creditors; and declares that on the&s;e con&s;iderations the relief granted by the preceding Acts &s;hould cea&s;e, provi&s;ion &s;hould be made out of the Trea|&s;ury of the United States, and that proper alterations are nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>This preamble conforms to the &s;tatement ju&s;t given. As far as there is a recital and con&s;truction of the pre|ceding Acts, they mu&s;t both conform to them. The Legi&s;lature certainly had no de&s;ign to deceive&mdash;nor to form a con&s;truction, nor to pur&s;ue mea&s;ures, in con&s;e|quence of &s;uch con&s;truction which the Acts them&s;elves or public faith would not warrant. The provi&s;ions made in the former Acts were de&s;igned to be permanent, and if public nece&s;&s;ity now compelled an alteration it ju&s;tified it no further than the inability of the State required&mdash;that inability required no more than a tem|porary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of payment, and ju&s;tice to the credi|tors demanded that to compen&s;ate this lo&s;s, they &s;hould be entitled to any benefits Congre&s;s might grant by exchanging their certificates &s;hould that mea&s;ure become nece&s;&s;ary. This Act &s;hould not be con&s;idered &s;eparately and di&s;tinctly, but relatively to the others on the &s;ub|ject,
<PB N="323" REF="027132_0331_0FD351A028D61DE8">
and the con&s;truction be determined from a general view of the whole.</P>
<P>The alterations intended are contained in the &s;econd &s;ection, which directs "That the intere&s;t due and to become due and payable upon all and every the certi|ficates i&s;&s;ued by the Comptroller-General in pur&s;uance of the &s;aid recited Acts or either of them, &s;hall be paid up &s;o as to complete the payment of intere&s;t to four years; and that &s;o much of every Act or Acts of General A&s;&s;embly as directs or &s;ecures the payment of the prin|cipal &s;um or &s;ums in the &s;aid certificates or any of them mentioned, or of the intere&s;t thereof beyond the term of four years &s;hall be and the &s;ame is hereby repealed and made null and void."</P>
<P>The Legi&s;lature in&s;tead of repealing the Act of March 1786, or de&s;troying the certificates, declaring them in the language of the impeachment to be no longer a debt, or evidence of a debt, due and owing from the State of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania;</HI> merely repeat that part of it, which provides for the payment of the principal or the intere&s;t beyond 4 years: the remainder therefore of the Act continues in full force and every thing already completed &s;tands unaffected. The expre&s;&s;ions <HI>null and void</HI> could not be here intended to have any reference to the pa&s;t, becau&s;e the intere&s;t is directed to be paid on the whole to complete 4 years, and in order to com|ply with this requi&s;ition payments mu&s;t in many in|&s;tances be made of intere&s;t <HI>accruing after</HI> the pa&s;&s;ing of this Act, as in the&s;e ca&s;es its commencement was not four years before its pa&s;&s;ing; the whole clau&s;e therefore with re&s;pect to payment, operates on &s;ome as a pre&s;ent on others as a future prohibition, but in no in&s;tance as a retro&s;pect.</P>
<P>Moreover had the Act of March 1789 entirely repeal|ed the Act of March 1786, it would not have thereby effected the de&s;truction of the certificates. They were completed under the Act while in full force, and could not be injured by any &s;ub&s;equent repeal. Like titles
<PB N="324" REF="027132_0332_0FD351A17872E1C8">
under laws that afterwards become ob&s;olete, expire, or are repealed they &s;till remain in full vigour.</P>
<P>The Act al&s;o of March 1789 &s;o far from having a retro&s;pect to the pa&s;t, only refers to the pre&s;ent and the future, and be&s;ides the payment of the intere&s;t al|ready mentioned, contemplates the probability that many New-Loan creditors may wi&s;h under the circum&s;tances in which they are placed, to retake the Continental certifi|cates loaned to the State, and therefore appropriates them <HI>a fund</HI> for the redemption of the New-Loans to &s;uch as chu&s;e to take them; the 3d &s;ection regulating the pro|ceeding&mdash;Council under who&s;e direction the whole was placed, among other regulations direct by rule 3d that where an equal exchange cannot be made <HI>fre&s;h New-Loan certificates</HI> &s;hall be i&s;&s;ued for the balance. The&s;e have accordingly been i&s;&s;ued in numerous in&s;tances, and have always been con&s;idered of equal validity with tho&s;e originally i&s;&s;ued. This could not be ju&s;tified had the law <HI>aboli&s;hed</HI> the certificates, as their circulation would be de&s;troyed, they would no longer exi&s;t a demand again&s;t the commonwealth, and of cour&s;e no new ones could legally be i&s;&s;ued.</P>
<P>Had the Legi&s;lature de&s;igned to annihilate the debt, they certainly would have taken effectual mea&s;ures for that purpo&s;e and have aboli&s;hed the certificates alto|gether. An appo&s;ite in&s;tance has taken place in <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> where the Legi&s;lature de&s;igning to de&s;troy certain certificates, commonly called Warrenton certi|ficates, which had corruptly i&s;&s;ued, altho' under legal authority; they explicitly declare that <HI>all the certificates</HI> of this de&s;cription are <HI>null and void</HI> and &s;hall not be received in payment of taxes or any other public de|mand what&s;oever. <HI>(North-Carolina</HI> Laws, p. 475.)</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e however for a moment, that the Le|gi&s;lature de&s;igned to de&s;troy the&s;e certificates. It would then be contended that they were deprived of the power. At the time of pa&s;&s;ing this Act the Federal Con&s;titution was in complete operation: The 10th &s;ection of the fir&s;t article declares that "No State &s;hall enter into any
<PB N="325" REF="027132_0333_0FD351A49FDA0D80">
treaty, alliance or confederation; grant letters of marque and repri&s;al; coin money; emit bills of credit; make any thing but gold and &s;ilver coin a tender in payment of debts; pa&s;s any bill of attainder, ex po&s;t facto laws, <HI>or law impairing the obligation of contracts,</HI> or grant any title of nobility."&mdash;That the &s;tate by the fir&s;t Act, con|tracted with the holders of New-Loans and engaged her&s;elf to pay them, can admit of no doubt, for inde|pendently of the Act it&s;elf, it is &s;olemnly acknowledged in the re&s;olution of December 1786. As little doubt can be entertained that if the Legi&s;lature in the la&s;t Act, intended to de&s;troy the debt, it was invalidating the engagement and of cour&s;e impairing the contract. This Act therefore if de&s;igned for this purpo&s;e is <HI>void</HI> by the Con&s;titution of the United States. This Con&s;titution was lately adopted; it had been fully debated before its adoption; many of the members of this Legi&s;lature had al&s;o been members of the Convention that adopted it, they mu&s;t have been fully &s;en&s;ible of its obligatory force, and little inclined to act in direct, and it may be added, violent oppo&s;ition to it.</P>
<P>To con&s;true this law then, as an <HI>abolition</HI> of the debt, would be to make it violate every principle of national honor and ju&s;tice&mdash;to operate in the nature of an ex po&s;t facto law, re&s;cinding contracts fairly made, and &s;olemnly acknowledged to be binding&mdash;it would make the Legi&s;lature act in direct oppo&s;ition to their former explicit declarations and the Federal Con&s;titu|tion&mdash;it would in fine be &s;uppo&s;ing intentions very dif|ferent from tho&s;e that actuated the Legi&s;lature at the time.</P>
<P>We have &s;een then that the occa&s;ion did not require an abolition of the debt; that a repeal of the whole Act of March 1786 would not effect it, much le&s;s then a repeal of a particular part&mdash;that it would be contrary to the principles of ju&s;tice and the Con&s;titution to de|&s;troy it&mdash;of cour&s;e we have no rea&s;on to pre&s;ume that the Legi&s;lature intended it.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="027132_0334_0FD351A74F1A93C0">Indeed the intention of the Legi&s;lature as it may be collected from &s;ucceed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">g acts upon this &s;ubject, ap|pears to have been very foreign from aboli&s;hing the debt.</P>
<P>By an Act pa&s;&s;ed 7th April 1791, p. 51, the Gover|nor is directed to negociate a loan with the bank of <HI>North-America,</HI> which when effected, together with the other funds are formed into an aggregate fund to di&s;|charge certain obligations of the commonwealth, and the&s;e are to be paid agreeably to the order they are ar|ranged in by the Act. Among others are the arrear|ages of intere&s;t due on the New-Loan certificates. The&s;e certificates are here cla&s;&s;ed among the other obli|gations of the State, as certificates <HI>&s;till in exi&s;tence,</HI> and the arrearages of intere&s;t are directed to be paid prior to any future intere&s;t on the funded debt.</P>
<P>An Act pa&s;&s;ed 30th September 1791, page 147, giv|ing relief to <HI>Sarah Caldwell</HI> and others, who had lo&s;t New-Loan certificates, after reciting the particulars of their ca&s;e directs &s;ufficient &s;ecurity to be given to <HI>indem|nify</HI> the commonwealth <HI>again&s;t the certificates</HI> before the relief can be granted. It is remarkable al&s;o that this Act pur&s;ues <HI>exactly</HI> the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ions in requiring the indemnity again&s;t the certificates with tho&s;e u&s;ed in a former Act pa&s;&s;ed for the relief of <HI>Sarah Caldwell</HI> long before the Act of March 1789, viz. 4th October 1788, page 535, &s;ect. 2. If the&s;e certificates were <HI>de|&s;troyed</HI> by the Act of March 1789 they would no longer be recognized by the Legi&s;lature as certificates <HI>of this &s;tate</HI>&mdash;If the &s;tate was not <HI>an&s;werable</HI> for the amount of them it would be u&s;ele&s;s to require an <HI>indemnification</HI>&mdash; This indemnification is <HI>general,</HI> being intended to guard the &s;tate again&s;t <HI>any injury</HI> that could po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e from granting relief in the premi&s;es, or the New-Loans tho' lo&s;t might &s;till be in circulation. As the <HI>&s;ame</HI> requi&s;i|tions are made in this Act that are made in the fir&s;t mentioned one which preceded the Act of March 1789 and in the <HI>&s;ame</HI> words; we may further conclude, that the Legi&s;lature con&s;idered them as much <HI>obligations now</HI>
<PB N="327" REF="027132_0335_0FD350F3435A3720">
as they were <HI>then,</HI> and prudently provided again&s;t any contingent injury that might otherwi&s;e ari&s;e, from granting the relief intended by the Act.</P>
<P>The 3d &s;ection of an Act pa&s;&s;ed 7th of April 1791, page 54, directs the <HI>injurious and impolitic expedient</HI> of re-i&s;&s;uing the bills of credit which the <HI>public faith</HI> was already plighted to de&s;troy; to pay off the arrearages of intere&s;t due on the New-Loans, in order that they might not interfere with the arrangements of the com|monwealth for &s;ub&s;cribing to the loan of Congre&s;s. Their <HI>interference</HI> mu&s;t certainly have been a matter of great importance to render &s;o injurious an expedient nece&s;&s;ary in order to prevent it; but in what manner it may be a&s;ked can they po&s;&s;ibly interfere? If they no longer continue <HI>State debt,</HI> the State is <HI>no longer</HI> under an obligation to pay them, &s;he therefore on this account could have no concern&mdash;if they are not <HI>&s;ub&s;cribable</HI> to the loan of Congre&s;s, they could not interfere with the arrangements of the State for &s;ub&s;cribing to that loan; for they would be of no validity, and if offered for &s;ub&s;cription, would undoubtedly be rejected. The Con|tinental certificates which the State had received in lieu of the New-Loans, &s;he had already appropriated as a fund for redeeming them, and if they were ex|changed for the New-Loans, the&s;e la&s;t would not be &s;ub&s;cribed by the State, becau&s;e the law of the United States which authori&s;ed the &s;ub&s;cription, expre&s;sly di|rected an equivalent to be &s;urrendered up, before in|tere&s;t could be paid, and as the State in this in&s;tance, would have parted with the equivalent it would be injurious to do it. The New-Loans could therefore interfere with the&s;e arrangements in no other way than this; they were at this time both State debt, and &s;ub|&s;cribable to the loan of Congre&s;s; their quantity (if &s;ub&s;cribed) would exclude the other State creditors from &s;ubcribing, and deprive the State of the oppor|tunity &s;he now had, of di&s;charging great part of her debts, and of making ample provi&s;ion for the future di&s;charge of the remainder. In order to improve this
<PB N="328" REF="027132_0336_0FD351A9410FB2B0">
favourable opportunity, it became a matter of mo&s;t &s;eri|ous concern to exclude the&s;e certificates from &s;ub&s;crip|tion, and the State was compelled thro' the want of a better, to pur&s;ue the injurious expedient mentioned in the Act, which it was pre&s;umed would be, as it actually was, counterbalanced by the re&s;ult.</P>
<P>By virtue of the Act of Congre&s;s of the 4th of Au|gu&s;t, 1790, two loans were opened; one of the dome&s;|tic debt to its full amount; the other of the State debts to the amount of 21,500,000 dollars, which were a&s;|&s;umed by the United States, under the exceptions and re&s;trictions laid down in the Act. Of the&s;e 21,500,000 dollars, the portion allotted to <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> was, 2,200,000, which was payable in tho&s;e &s;tate certifi|cates which prior to the 1&s;t January, 1790, had i&s;&s;ued for national purpo&s;es. The debt of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> was at this time cla&s;&s;ed under three de&s;criptions, Funded debt, Depreciation debt, and New-Loan debt. On the whole of the Funded, and part of the Depreciation (thence called Funded Depreciation) the State paid an intere&s;t of 6 per cent.; on the unfounded depreciation, (which include the remainder) intere&s;t tho' payable, had never been paid as no funds had been appropriated for the purpo&s;e: and on the New-Loans, no intere&s;t except the 4 year's arrears was at this time paying. The whole amount of the funded and depreciation debt, did not exceed 1,500,000 dollars; the New-Loans alone exceeded 2,200,000 the &s;um a&s;&s;umed. If there|fore the New-Loans could be <HI>excluded</HI> from &s;ub&s;cription, and the holders <HI>induced</HI> to redeem them by the Conti|nental certificates, at the &s;ame time proper encourage|ment given to tho&s;e State creditors, to whom the State was paying intere&s;t, viz. the holders of the funded debt, and funded depreciation, to &s;ub&s;cribe to the State loan; the State would immediately get rid of all her New-Loan debt, &s;he would have the amount of the other &s;ub&s;cribed, redeemed by virtue of the &s;ub&s;cription&mdash; her revenues would be relieved from the greater part of the annual intere&s;t &s;he was now paying, as upon the plan
<PB N="329" REF="027132_0337_0FD351AABA0001D8">
&s;he was pur&s;uing, the intere&s;t &s;he would receive from the un&s;ub&s;cribed re&s;iduum, would compen&s;ate the &s;ub|&s;cribers for what they would otherwi&s;e loo&s;e by &s;ub&s;crib|ing. If on the contrary, the New-Loans were &s;ub&s;crib|ed, they would exclude the others, and add to the bur|thens of the State. No time however could be more favourable than the pre&s;ent, for accompli&s;hing the plan, and no mode better adapted to the purpo&s;e, than the one pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>In the dome&s;tic loan, the intere&s;t &s;ub&s;cribed, was &s;e|parated from the principal, and exclu&s;ively became 3 per cent. &s;tock: two thirds of the principal became 6 per cent. &s;tock, and the remaining third, 6 per cents deferred. In the State loan the principal and intere&s;t were thrown into a common ma&s;s, one third of which was converted into 3 per cent. &s;tock, two thirds of the remaining two thirds into 6 per cent. &s;tock, and one third of two thirds into 6 per cents. deferred. From this la&s;t arrangement it followed that unle&s;s the intere&s;t &s;ub&s;cribed, amounted to one third of the whole &s;um &s;ub&s;cribed &s;o much of the principal as equalled this de|ficiency, &s;upplied its place and was converted into 3 per cents. In order that the intere&s;t &s;hould amount to one third of the whole, it required an arrearage of eight years and a quarter. In the ca&s;e therefore of the New-Loans, when the arrearages was eight years and a quar|ter, the holder might &s;ub&s;cribe them to the State loan, or exchange them for the Continental certificates and &s;ub&s;cribe the&s;e to the dome&s;tic loan, &s;ince in both ca&s;es the intere&s;t alone, became 3 per cent. &s;tock. Where the arrear was greater it was his intere&s;t to &s;ub&s;cribe the New-Loan in preference to the Continental certificate, as the exce&s;s of intere&s;t became 6 per cent. &s;tock or 6 per cents. deferred. Where it was le&s;s it became inju|rious to &s;ub&s;cribe them becau&s;e part of the principal went to &s;upply the deficiency. By paying off four years immediately on the New-Loans, and di&s;countenancing their &s;ub&s;cription to the State loan, (which was done by the Act pa&s;&s;ed two days afterwards, making the ar|rangements
<PB N="330" REF="027132_0338_0FD350F551B8C228">
alluded to in this Act, and which gave en|couragement only to the &s;ub&s;cription of certificates on which an intere&s;t was then paying,) the arrears of in|tere&s;t were reduced below eight years and a quarter, it became the intere&s;t of the holder to redeem the New-Loan by the Continental, and &s;ub&s;cribe to the dome&s;tic loan. It was al&s;o his intere&s;t to receive the 4 years arrear in preference to &s;ub&s;cribing the New-Loan; as the indents to be paid the State on the exchange to equalize the intere&s;t, were then low, the amount he paid the State on the New-Loan became due to him on the Continental, and the money paid him by the State be|came a new principal. The State by agreeing to pay 6 per cent. on the deferred, and 3 per cent. on the 3 per cent. &s;tock, created by the &s;ub&s;cription of the other State debt, was a &s;ufficient inducement to the creditor to &s;ub&s;cribe, as by this mean the arrears of intere&s;t were converted into 6 per cent. &s;tock.</P>
<P>The State by this policy got rid of mo&s;t of the New-Loans; redeemed 650,000 dollars of her other debt; and became entitled to an intere&s;t of a re&s;iduum of 1,550,000 dollars, which amounted to nearly 56,000 dollars annually or upwards of &pound;. 20,000. The&s;e were the advantages &s;he promi&s;ed her&s;elf from the plan &s;he had then formed; they appeared &s;ufficiently important to be purcha&s;ed at the expence of this ruinous expedi|ent, and they were effectually &s;ecured, in con&s;equence of the mea&s;ures pur&s;ued. The&s;e two Acts as effectually &s;hew the ideas the <HI>Legi&s;lature</HI> entertained of the <HI>&s;ub|&s;cribability</HI> of New-Loans as the mo&s;t expre&s;s declara|tion that could po&s;&s;ibly be made on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>From the foregoing &s;urvey it &s;ufficiently appears, that the Act of March, 1789, <HI>did not de&s;troy</HI> the New-Loans, that in the <HI>opinion</HI> of the <HI>Legi&s;lature</HI> they &s;till continued a debt, and were in their e&s;timation &s;ub&s;crib|able to the loan of the United States. It will now be proper to con&s;ider the Act e&s;tabli&s;hing that loan and to point out that part which admits their &s;ub&s;cription.</P>
<P>The Act of Congre&s;s of the 4th of Augu&s;t 1790,
<PB N="331" REF="027132_0339_0FD351AD03707288">
continued by that of the 8th of May 1792, was formed to introduce order and harmony into the public finances, by reducing to a few kinds the great variety of public &s;ecurities;&mdash;to make a Continental debt of all tho&s;e State certificates which had i&s;&s;ued for national purpo&s;es &mdash;and to give &s;ecurity and value to the whole by pre|venting counterfeits, and appropriating permanent funds for their regular payment. It therefore in the 13th &s;ec|tion, page 93, a&s;&s;umes all State certificates or notes which had i&s;&s;ued prior to the fir&s;t of January 1790, as compen&s;ations or expenditures for &s;ervices or &s;upplies towards the pro&s;ecution of the war, excepting the War|renton certificates of <HI>North-Carolina</HI> which were ex|pre&s;sly excluded.</P>
<P>The New-Loans clearly come within this de&s;cription. They were directed to i&s;&s;ue, and con&s;equently did i&s;&s;ue, only for Continental certificates which had i&s;&s;ued for the&s;e &s;ervices. The <HI>&s;ervices</HI> them&s;elves were the origi|nal inducement for i&s;&s;uing them, and Continental cer|tificates of this de&s;cription only were received.</P>
<P>If this &s;ection is con&s;trued &s;trictly according to the letter the depreciation certificates about which there has exi&s;ted no doubt would al&s;o be excluded, as they &s;trictly &s;peaking did not i&s;&s;ue for <HI>&s;ervices</HI> but to com|pen&s;ate <HI>lo&s;&s;es</HI> occa&s;ioned by the depreciation of the &s;ol|diers pay; tho' here as in the ca&s;e of the New-Loans, the &s;ervices rendered were the original inducement.</P>
<P>This con&s;truction would al&s;o operate to exclude a con&s;iderable portion of the funded debt, as it &s;tood at the time of the loan. For altho' the greater part of it originally i&s;&s;ued agreeably to the letter of the Act, as compen&s;ations or expenditures for &s;ervices or &s;upplies, yet, for the convenience of payments at the Land-office, and to facilitate their circulation, the original certifi|cates were frequently &s;urrendered up, and new ones i&s;&s;ued for different &s;ums, and in different numbers as &s;uited the convenience of the party. The&s;e la&s;t there|fore having i&s;&s;ued for <HI>other</HI> certificates would agreeably to this <HI>&s;trict</HI> con&s;truction be excluded.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="027132_0340_0FD3515849ACB710">In order to accompli&s;h the de&s;ign of this Act it was as nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;ume the New-Loans as any other certifi|cates. They were certificates of the State, and the State was a creditor of the United States to an equal amount. Congre&s;s therefore by a&s;&s;uming them, and directing that before intere&s;t could be paid an equal amount of Continental certificates &s;hould be &s;urrendered up, at once withdrew both from circulation. As a holder of New-Loans, the United States could exchange with the State for an equal amount of Continental certificates, and the &s;um &s;ub&s;cribed, for which the State would be debited in her accounts with the Union, &s;he could ba|lance by pre&s;enting an equal amount of New-Loans which &s;he had redeemed in this way, and which would be on the &s;ame footing with the other certificates &s;he had redeemed.</P>
<P>Could any doubt exi&s;t re&s;pecting the con&s;truction of the 13th &s;ection, it mu&s;t be removed by the 18th, page 97, which con&s;idering all certificates &s;ituated like the New-Loans, as &s;ub&s;cribable under the 13th &s;ection makes the nece&s;&s;ary regulations to prevent any incon|venience that might otherwi&s;e en&s;ue.</P>
<P>The Secretary of the Trea&s;ury in his in&s;tructions to Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> the Commi&s;&s;ioner of Loans for this State, declares they are &s;ub&s;cribable, and directs arrangements in con&s;equence. In his letters to Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> he con|&s;tantly con&s;iders them &s;ub&s;cribable. His negociations with our government are founded on a belief that they have been <HI>actually</HI> &s;ub&s;cribed, and turn at la&s;t upon the fact of their having been &s;ub&s;cribed or not.</P>
<P>If an inconvenience were to ari&s;e to the State in con|&s;equence of their &s;ub&s;cription, this would not de&s;troy their &s;ub&s;cribability. That ari&s;es from the <HI>a&s;&s;umption</HI> of Congre&s;s and not from any <HI>arrangement</HI> of the State. The loan is opened to the State creditors and the con|&s;ent or refu&s;al of the State has no concern with it. Con|gre&s;s may a&s;&s;ume what debts they plea&s;e, and the cre|ditor may transfer to them all debts of a transferrable na|ture. This is a matter entirely between Congre&s;s and the
<PB N="333" REF="027132_0341_0FD351AED574CC40">
creditor in which the State cannot interfere more than in the transfer from citizen to citizen. In the &s;ettlement of accounts between the United States and this &s;tate, the intere&s;t commences, and either party may allow or reject &s;uch items as are improper, but this can have no effect upon the original a&s;&s;umption, which concerns merely Congre&s;s and the &s;tate creditor.</P>
<P>One object in view by the a&s;&s;umption was to with|draw the creditor, from the precarious and frequently inadequate relief of State provi&s;ions. The&s;e creditors were certainly of this de&s;cription, and in no ca&s;e except in others &s;imilarly circum&s;tanced could Congre&s;s a&s;&s;ume certificates with &s;o much &s;afety, as they had i&s;&s;ued for debts originally liquidated and adju&s;ted by the United States.</P>
<P>I hope then it has been &s;atisfactorily proved, that the New-Loans were in their fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment State debt; placed on a permanent footing, and highly favoured; that their de&s;truction was not de&s;igned by the Act of March 1789; that at &s;ucceeding periods they have been con&s;idered as State debt and &s;ub&s;cribable by the Legi&s;|lature it&s;elf, of cour&s;e the &s;ub&s;criptions made have been conformable to law.</P>
<P>We now come to the po&s;ition which forms the e&s;&s;ence of the &s;econd article, viz. that the New-Loans were not nor could in any way be contemplated as objects of re|demption by the Act of April 1792.</P>
<P>This Act was de&s;igned to di&s;charge the certificates of the State, and her other obligations which the pub|lic intere&s;t required and which it was now in the power of the State to perform. Our Legi&s;lature had always conceived it to be more advantageous to the State to redeem her certificates in the ca&s;es where &s;he had it in her power thro' the <HI>medium</HI> of the United States in pre|ference to <HI>paying them off</HI> and making that payment a credit in her accounts with the Union. This was evi|dent in the fir&s;t &s;ub&s;cription to the State loan which was promoted by the &s;tate, and this was their wi&s;h in the Act of April 1792 as is apparent from the Act it&s;elf.
<PB N="334" REF="027132_0342_0FD350F816CBDC78">
By the fir&s;t &s;ub&s;cription the State redeemed all the cer|tificates that were &s;ub&s;cribed, and only paid in return that portion of intere&s;t which the United States did not, which payment was to continue only until the United States paid it. She now wi&s;hed to redeem all her debt inclu&s;ive of the evidences of this obligation, commonly called Purpart certificates, and altho' &s;he in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, paid off the whole in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, yet &s;he received from the United States an equivalent for the greater part of it, which was an active and productive &s;tock annually encrea&s;ing in value, and which by good management might be u&s;efully appropriated. The dif|ference in value between the certificates received and the money paid by the State in redemption, which was the only lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by this mode, (for if they were of equal value it would only amount to a mutual ex|change of equal intere&s;ts) was of le&s;s con&s;equence, than paying off the whole at once, and that payment remain|ing a dormant claim upon the Union, until the final adju&s;tment of accounts and provi&s;ion for the balance &s;hould call it into activity. It &s;hould be con&s;idered al&s;o that <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> was at this time deemed a creditor State, to a con&s;iderable amount and as in other ca&s;es of debtor and creditor, it was more to her advantage to redeem her certificates by way of &s;et-off in this account than to advance more money on it and thereby &s;well the credit further. Moreover upon &s;triking the balance of this account the State had no rea&s;on to pre&s;ume that &s;he would be more favoured in the di&s;charge of it, than the citizen creditors had been in the payment of their debts, but that certificates would i&s;&s;ue to her in the &s;ame pro|portions, they had already i&s;&s;ued to them. It was there|fore better to receive them now and make them imme|diately productive than wait a future day.</P>
<P>The Act therefore of April, 1792, after appropriat|ing the 3 per cent. &s;tock as a redeeming fund, and di|recting certain debts to be paid from the proceeds of the &s;ale; contemplates in the &s;ixth &s;ection a further provi&s;ion to be made by Congre&s;s, and directs that all
<PB N="335" REF="027132_0343_0FD351B0B89BBEB8">
certificates entitled to &s;uch provi&s;ions, &s;hall be entitled to the benefits of this Act upon transferring to the &s;tate all the benefits the creditor was to enjoy from the pro|vi&s;ion. The 8th of May following the loan was ex|tended by Congre&s;s upon the <HI>&s;ame terms,</HI> and of cour&s;e included all certificates that were &s;ub&s;cribable to the fir&s;t. This Act of April 1792 directing all certificates to be paid that were &s;ub&s;cribable of cour&s;e redeemed them. The New-Loans have already been proved to be &s;ub&s;cribable to this loan; and are therefore within the provi&s;ions of this Act. That they came within the view of the Legi&s;lature at the time, and were de&s;igned to be redeemed, will appear from the following con&s;i|derations. The Legi&s;lature knew they were in circu|lation. They had pa&s;&s;ed laws relieving tho&s;e who had lo&s;t them. They had endeavoured to prevent their &s;ub|&s;cription to the fir&s;t loan, and promote their redemption from the fund provided. In this de&s;ign they had &s;uc|ceeded &s;o far as to redeem the greater quantity; the whole amount now in circulation not exceeding fifty thou&s;and pounds, a &s;um comparatively &s;mall. Altho' intere&s;t was not now paying, it was accruing, and the arrear becoming great. Though the Continental cer|tificates were a fund for their redemption, yet the cre|ditor could not be <HI>compelled</HI> to redeem them in that way. The year 1796 was approaching when they were to be paid agreeably to contract. The exten&s;ion of the fir&s;t loan was contemplated in this Act, as the mea&s;ure mo&s;t probable, which they knew would include them. In fine, every argument that applies to prove the nece&s;&s;ity of redeeming any part of the public debt, applies with equal force in favor of the redemption of the New-Loans.</P>
<P>The third article charges him with not con&s;ulting with the Governor, nor the Regi&s;ter-General; nor di&s;|criminating the certificates on the ab&s;tracts, by which he declared them a&s;&s;umable, nor on the certificate by which he declared them redeemable, by which means
<PB N="336" REF="027132_0344_0FD350F94BC1B848">
the checks of office were broken, and the other officers deluded into error.</P>
<P>Both loans were opened with the concurrence and ap|probation of our Legi&s;lature, who promoted &s;ub&s;criptions of &s;tate debt by laws enacted for the purpo&s;e. It of cour&s;e became the duty of the officers of this &s;tate who had it in their power to facilitate the &s;ub&s;cription by their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> the conductor of the loan in this &s;tate, applied to the defendant before the opening of the fir&s;t loan (&s;ee page 271) to give him a de&s;cription of the &s;everal &s;orts of certificates &s;ub&s;cribable, and &s;uch checks as would enable him to conduct the bu&s;ine&s;s with &s;ecurity. The defendant was the only per&s;on to apply to, he having i&s;&s;ued all the certificates of the &s;tate, and having all the checks in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he accordingly gives him the required information and at the &s;ame time his opinion that the New-Loans <HI>were &s;ub&s;cribable.</HI> None can pre&s;ume he had any intere&s;t at this time in giving this opinion, as the loan clo&s;ed without any &s;ub&s;crip|tion of New-Loans being made.</P>
<P>After the clo&s;ing of the loan; in all the conferences which took place on the &s;ubject of New-Loans, by the direction of the Governor, and which were reported to him, the defendant continues of the <HI>&s;ame opinion;</HI> no <HI>exception</HI> is made to its propriety, and all matters re&s;ted in this way, till the opening of the &s;econd loan.</P>
<P>Before the pa&s;&s;ing of the Act of April 1792, the de|fendant oppo&s;ed that plan of redemption and propo&s;ed another to the Governor in which New-Loans are ex|pre&s;sly provided for. He deprecated the evil con&s;e|quences which that Act in its original comprehen&s;ive form, would probably occa&s;ion, and oppo&s;ed its pa&s;&s;ing by &s;peaking to members of both Hou&s;es on the &s;ubject, and pointing them out, (&s;ee page 279 to 286.) The Act was afterwards narrowed down to include certificates only. Had he de&s;igned to &s;peculate on the Act, it would have been his intere&s;t to encourage its pa&s;&s;ing, or at lea&s;t not to oppo&s;e it; after it became a law he was as much entitled to its benefits as another citizen.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="027132_0345_0FD35192157FEBE8">On the opening of the &s;econd loan it was di&s;covered, that non-a&s;&s;umable certificates had been &s;ub&s;cribed, and the owners in con&s;equence deprived of them until the clo&s;ing of the loan, at which time they would be returned. To prevent this inconvenience in future, the defendant undertook to examine the certificates brought for &s;ub|&s;cription, and if they were genuine and a&s;&s;umable, to mark them &s;o. His conduct in this tran&s;action was intended to oblige and a&s;&s;i&s;t all parties, it was an un|dertaking of great trouble, and no profit to him&s;elf; the information given, was for the u&s;e of Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> and the creditors who might rely upon it or not. There was no law forbidding &s;uch proceeding. It was further in advancement of the intere&s;t and laws of the State. The mode pur&s;ued was the dictate of the moment, the words "genuine and a&s;&s;umable" being &s;ometimes writ|ten on the ab&s;tract, at other times on the certificate, and in both ca&s;es &s;igned with the initials of his name. The matter was notorious. His opinion openly given. No objections advanced again&s;t it, and the loan clo&s;ed without any idea of criminality in his conduct being entertained by any body.</P>
<P>With the <HI>form</HI> of the ab&s;tracts the defendant had no concern, <HI>That</HI> was &s;ettled by the officers of the United States. Blank forms were printed for general conve|nience, and printed forms were generally u&s;ed. As all the certificates <HI>a&s;&s;umable</HI> were <HI>equally</HI> &s;o; there could be no occa&s;ion to <HI>di&s;criminate</HI> on the ab&s;tracts, their &s;e|veral kinds. If it had been nece&s;&s;ary as the informa|tion was for Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> he would have reque&s;ted it. It was not the <HI>duty</HI> of the defendant to do it, as he had merely undertaken, and that voluntarily to declare them genuine and a&s;&s;umable; and it would require more of his time than his official engagements would permit. Since all certificates &s;ub&s;cribable were <HI>equally</HI> redeem|able, there could be no occa&s;ion to <HI>di&s;criminate</HI> on the ab&s;tract on the transfer to the State their &s;everal kinds, becau&s;e they were to be <HI>equally</HI> paid. If it were, the Regi&s;ter-General &s;hould have done it, as they came be|fore
<PB N="338" REF="027132_0346_0FD350FE43E82AF8">
him in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and it is his duty to re|gi&s;ter the accounts of the State. After his examination, they were pre&s;ented to the Comptroller-General accom|panied with a demand on the State for payment. The <HI>ab&s;tracts them&s;elves</HI> afforded every information that a di&s;crimination could, for the <HI>dates</HI> of intere&s;t marked on the ab&s;tracts, di&s;tingui&s;hed the &s;everal kinds of cer|tificates; the intere&s;t on the funded debts commencing on one fixed date, that on the depreciation on another, and that of the New-Loans on various and mixed dates, all of them however di&s;tinct from the other two. There could have been no de&s;ign in the defendant to conceal any circum&s;tance relating to the New-Loans from the Regi&s;ter-General as they had had a conver|&s;ation on the &s;ubject, in the cour&s;e of which they both concurred in opinion that the New-Loans were &s;ub|&s;cribable and redeemable, and the Regi&s;ter-General afterwards pa&s;&s;ed the accounts knowing them to con|tain New-Loans.</P>
<P>His own &s;ub&s;cription being <HI>openly</HI> made in his <HI>own</HI> name, confutes the idea of any clande&s;tine de&s;ign, and &s;trongly &s;hews his thorough conviction of being right in his opinion. Had he &s;uppo&s;ed the contrary and wi&s;hed to deceive, how ea&s;y would it have been to divide the &s;um into &s;mall parcels, and procure other per&s;ons to &s;ub&s;cribe for him in their own names. The idea that he meant to deceive until he obtained <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion</HI> of the money which &s;eems to be advanced in this article, is too futile to have any weight and was perhaps introduced more from inadvertence than de&s;ign. Detection would eventually be certain; and the con&s;e|quences of that detection would be di&s;appointment and di&s;grace. His own &s;ub&s;cription was not hurried thro' the offices, it remained the u&s;ual time with the Regi&s;ter-General who might, and probably did, examine every item.</P>
<P>No checks of office have been broken. No official con&s;ultation is required by law in <HI>any</HI> in&s;tance; nor can there legally, be any <HI>interference</HI> of the Governor
<PB N="339" REF="027132_0347_0FD35101E6B09E08">
except upon a <HI>difference</HI> of opinion between the Compt|roller and Regi&s;ter in which ca&s;e he is called in to de|cide: Here was <HI>no</HI> &s;uch <HI>difference</HI> of opinion and of cour&s;e there could be no <HI>interference</HI> of the Governor. The Governor al&s;o knew from the defendant's former communications, and his late propo&s;al for new model|ling the debt, made at the time the Act was before the Legi&s;lature, that he con&s;idered the New-Loans as a debt and at a future time to be redeemed. The certifi|cate pre&s;ented to the Governor on which his warrant was grounded was in the <HI>u&s;ual form,</HI> there could there|fore be no <HI>concealment</HI> implied in it. The accounts which were pre&s;ented and adju&s;ted and in con&s;equence of which adju&s;tment this certificate was drawn, were al&s;o pre&s;ented in the <HI>u&s;ual form</HI> and therefore would not <HI>authori&s;e</HI> any deviation from the u&s;ual cour&s;e of pro|ceeding. Any cau&s;e that would require a <HI>di&s;crimination</HI> of the New-Loans would al&s;o require a <HI>di&s;crimination</HI> of the funded debt and the depreciation certificates. Yet no &s;uch di&s;crimination has been made and no com|plaint has ari&s;en in con&s;equence.</P>
<P>If any interference in the &s;econd loan by the defend|ant was wrong from principle it was equally wrong in the fir&s;t loan, for the two loans were preci&s;ely upon the &s;ame footing. Yet no fault has been found with him for it; and he has only been criminal according to the articles for acting between the 10th of April, and 1&s;t of Augu&s;t 1792, the <HI>principle</HI> is therefore admitted to be right and the <HI>execution</HI> only wrong.</P>
<P>But if it be (as we hope we have proved) that the New-Loans were &s;ub&s;cribable and redeemable, that all the proceedings on his part have been regular and legal; he has acted in every in&s;tance right and is a &s;ubject of commendation rather than blame.</P>
<P>Even on the &s;uppo&s;ition of his having formed a <HI>wrong opinion;</HI> that opinion has been proved to be formed, when there was no <HI>intere&s;t</HI> to induce him to form it. To be advanced upon every <HI>public occa&s;ion</HI> that required it. To be per&s;i&s;ted in and mentioned at a time when
<PB N="340" REF="027132_0348_0FD3510389F04BD8">
a <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> intere&s;t would induce a concealment; and we cannot look for a <HI>change,</HI> when it had received <HI>&s;anction,</HI> from <HI>time,</HI> from meeting with <HI>no</HI> oppo&s;ition of &s;entiment, from the <HI>concurrence</HI> of others in the &s;ame, and when <HI>nothing</HI> additional aro&s;e to occa&s;ion an alteration. Even then upon the &s;uppo&s;ition the opinion on examination &s;hall be found erroneous; it was innocently formed and cannot &s;ubject its author to the pains and penalties of an impeachment.</P>
<P>The following po&s;itions then have it is hoped been fully e&s;tabli&s;hed. That the New-Loan certificates con|tinued a <HI>State debt</HI> notwith&s;tanding the Act of <HI>March</HI> 1789, which did not contemplate their de&s;truction, and which could not effect it had it been its de&s;ign. That they were <HI>&s;ub&s;cribable</HI> to the loans of the United States and <HI>known</HI> and <HI>acknowledged</HI> to be &s;o by the Legi&s;la|ture it&s;elf. Than they were <HI>redeemable</HI> by the Act of April 1792, and <HI>de&s;igned</HI> to be &s;o by the Legi&s;la|ture that pa&s;&s;ed the Act. That no <HI>checks of office</HI> have been broken, of cour&s;e the defendant has <HI>broken none.</HI> That his conduct throughout has been open, candid and &s;incere, and <HI>&s;trictly</HI> conformable to law in every particular. That his <HI>opinion</HI> on the &s;ubject is <HI>right</HI> and &s;o <HI>innocent</HI> in its formation that had it been <HI>wrong</HI> he could not be amenable to puni&s;hment in this pro&s;e|cution.</P>
<P>In the minutes of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives the following entry is recorded:</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Mr. Speaker, and
Gentlemen of the Senate,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honor of being of coun&s;el for the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of the commonwealth of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> who are the exclu&s;ive Repre&s;entatives of the People of this State, and they found it their indi&s;|pen&s;ible duty to execute their con&s;titutional right of bringing before the Senate, in this in&s;tance, the exclu|&s;ive Judges, a public officer who has long &s;uperintended the finances of the State, under a &s;erious charge.</P>
<P><HI>John Nichol&s;on,</HI> Comptroller-General of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> is accu&s;ed of having violated the confidence and be|trayed the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him. Upon common ca&s;es the hand of the law is directed by the ordinary courts of criminal juri&s;diction. The Senate is con&s;titutionally a&s;&s;embled to decide upon a cau&s;e in which the intere&s;ts of a People are involved to which the common limits of practical law are &s;carcely applicable.</P>
<P>A cau&s;e which requires the more con&s;ideration as it is the more rare, &s;ince public tru&s;ts are confided but to a few, and &s;ince violation of the&s;e tru&s;ts are happily uncommon, the pre&s;ent is recorded as only the fir&s;t
<PB N="342" REF="027132_0350_0FD35104FB362078">
under the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> every g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> citizen will wi&s;h it may be the la&s;t.</P>
<P>To con&s;titute an offence there mu&s;t be a concurrence of fact and of intention.</P>
<P>The errors of the judgment cannot be criminally puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>But when by the aid of te&s;timony we probe the heart, when motives unlawful from the &s;tation and the oppor|tunities of the agent are already proved to be the ex|citements to action&mdash;then the act is clo&s;ed in the li&s;t of offences, and the voice of &s;ociety calls for its judicial animadver&s;ion.</P>
<P>Of offences there are two general cla&s;&s;es, one is found in the breach of any po&s;itive law, municipal in&s;titutions, or &s;tatutes.</P>
<P>The other in the breach of a law not of human in|&s;titution but impre&s;&s;ed by nature on the heart.</P>
<P>The penalty of the fir&s;t may be incurred without any criminal intentions, but the other depends upon the will, ignorance may at times occa&s;ion a lap&s;e into the fir&s;t, the other is known to all men at all times, in all places.</P>
<P>The defendant's coun&s;el have anticipated another very obvious divi&s;ion of the que&s;tion; that is, that the Compt|roller acted under a proper or mi&s;taken con&s;truction of the law. If the latter, corrupt motives mu&s;t be plainly charged, and clearly proved.</P>
<P>If we &s;hew that the defendant made a profit again&s;t law, the impeachment is &s;upported. If we &s;hew that impelled by improper motives, by artifice and dexterity he evaded, altho' he did not break the law, it is equally &s;upported, and the commonwealth is entitled to judge|ment again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Something has been &s;aid as to the manner of fram|ing the charges.</P>
<P>It has been &s;tated only to be waved, and at the &s;ame time the Senate is informed that the defendant does not well know what he is to an&s;wer, you're told that he will go fully into his an&s;wer.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="027132_0351_0FD351B410969CD0">If we pa&s;s this over we hear of it as a defeat. If we confute the objection we are told they did not mean to rely on it.</P>
<P>But we aver the charges are exhibited in the autho|rized and cu&s;tomary form, that the minute certainties of indictments are not requi&s;ite, that nothing is inten|tionally dark or tending to deceive, and that as in &s;ome in&s;tances of indictments the defendant may require a &s;pecification, the&s;e are framed conformably to well e&s;tabli&s;hed precedents in another country. (Here Mr. <HI>Rawle</HI> quoted 2 vol. <HI>Woode&s;on,</HI> page 605, and <HI>Fo&s;ter's</HI> reports of Crown Laws, 389, 390, to &s;hew that in bar|ratry the defendant is not compelled to an&s;wer until a &s;pecification of the charges is exhibited; and &s;aid, &s;uch was not requi&s;ite in impeachments, and therefore concluded it was only want of form and accuracy had been attempted to be &s;hewn; Mr. <HI>Lewis</HI> interrupted him, and &s;aid, It is not to the form but to the &s;ub&s;tance of the articles of impeachment that he intended to take exception.)</P>
<P>The accu&s;ation is, in &s;ub&s;tance divided into &s;ix dif|ferent and &s;ub&s;tantial heads which Mr. <HI>Rawle</HI> then enumerated including the 5th and 6th articles in one.</P>
<P N="1">1. Declaring New-Loan certificates to be &s;ub&s;crib|able.</P>
<P N="2">2. Declaring them to be redeemable.</P>
<P N="3">3. Deceiving the Governor.</P>
<P N="4">4. By the aid of &s;uch deception drawing money out of a fund otherwi&s;e appropriated.</P>
<P N="5">5. Buying certificates actually delivered to him for exchange.</P>
<P N="6">6. Converting to his own u&s;e certificates actually ex|changed.</P>
<P>The formal arrangement of the&s;e charges is compri&s;ed in &s;even articles of impeachment. In all them he is charged with criminal motives, with the Commi&s;&s;ion of a mi&s;demeanor; and if the evidence is adequate to the charges there is no doubt but the re&s;ult will be a judg|ment again&s;t the Comptroller-General.</P>

<HEAD>FIRST ARTICLE</HEAD>
<P>Was read by Mr. <HI>Rawle</HI> in a &s;hort and abridged man|ner, retaining only the principal <HI>data,</HI> &s;uch as facts, and dates; omitting the u&s;ele&s;s appendages of amplifi|cation.</P>
<P>The general charges are thus opened with the &s;tate|ment of a fact re&s;ulting from the plain and obvious text of the law and finally reducible to this &s;ingle point: Whether there exi&s;ted a Legi&s;lative power in the coun|try.</P>
<P>If the Legi&s;lative power re&s;ided in the General A&s;|&s;embly, and, if the Act of 27th March 1789 was pa&s;&s;ed by that General A&s;&s;embly we have then only to enquire whether it did not aboli&s;h the former engagements of the State and reduce the certificates to mere receipts for other certificates.</P>
<P>Without any efforts of ingenuity, or having recour&s;e to me&s;&s;ages, votes, re&s;olutions and other proceedings of of the Legi&s;lature from their minutes, we are led to acknowledge the affirmative from the exi&s;tence of the Act of March 27, 1789, and to a&s;certain with accuracy the operation of it, we are led to con&s;ider the nature of New-Loans previous to the pa&s;&s;ing of the law.</P>
<P>The Act of March 1, 1786, depended upon the cir|cum&s;tances of the public at the time, the &s;tate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the impo&s;t, and appropriated it to pay the intere&s;t of the reputed quota of the State debt incurred during the late war.</P>
<P>In the year 1785 the Legi&s;lature affected by the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es and yielding to the clamours of many of their own citizens, creditors of the United States, finding it&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a great and growing fund ari&s;ing from the impo&s;ts&mdash;by its Act of 16th March 1785, appro|priated &s;uch a proportion of that fund with the arrear|ages of the taxes as &s;hould amount to &pound;. 123,932, the e&s;timated quota of this State of the annual intere&s;t of the federal debt.</P>
<P>This Act tho' little noticed, yet de&s;erves no &s;mall degree of preliminary attention.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="345" REF="027132_0353_0FD351B76AAA7C40">13th <HI>&s;ection.</HI> The State-Trea&s;urer is to pay that &s;um annually to the Continental Loan-officer.</P>

<P>Having thus ob&s;erved, that, this Act, the parent of the New-Loan Act, could not in its out&s;et be con&s;idered as otherwi&s;e than temporary, for the chief part of the impo&s;t being the principal fund, remained only the <HI>conditional property</HI> of the State; <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> having by her Act of 23d September, 1783, acceded to the requi&s;ition of Congre&s;s in regard to the 5 per cent. and the annual tax as &s;oon as thirteen States &s;hould accede thereto.</P>
<P>To this reference appears in the &s;econd and third &s;ections of the Act of 16th March 1785.</P>

<P>In the 7th &s;ection, relief to them, and to accord with &s;uch mea&s;ures as the United States in their wi&s;dom may adopt.</P>
<P>By this it is apparent that the provi&s;ion made by <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> was temporary, whereas the United States did re&s;olve for 25 years. The declarations of the in|tentions of our Legi&s;lature contained in the la&s;t recited &s;ections are expre&s;sly affected by the 18th &s;ection, in which the provi&s;ional limitation of the Act is contained, and this expre&s;s de&s;ignation of the original fund confutes one of the arguments of the coun&s;el who opened the defence, (Mr. <HI>Tilghman.)</HI></P>
<P>I need not enter into me&s;&s;ages or re&s;olutions to di&s;|cover the &s;ignification of this provi&s;ion; it was intended and declared to be temporary and conditional, and as &s;uch the Legi&s;lature has always acted upon it.</P>
<P>We are told it is of no u&s;e to the creditors out of what fund this debt is to be paid, whereas the fund is held out and the party accepts it on the faith of that fund, and that only.</P>

<P>Thirdly, There is no repeal of the conditional clau&s;e in Act of the 16th March 1785 by the Act of March 1, 1786; the &s;pirit is the &s;ame, only differing in mode, and form from the Act March 16th 1785.</P>
<P>Fourthly, There is no a&s;&s;umption of the principal, for the receivability of the certificates in the Land-office was common to almo&s;t all kinds of Continental certificates.</P>
<P>The difficulties of the country increa&s;ing, the nece&s;|&s;ity of a common head became more apparent, the Federal Con&s;titution under which we now &s;o happily live, was formed and recommended the 17th September, 1787. It was adopted by <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> the 13th of December following, and by nine States on the 21&s;t of June, 1788. The Act of 27th March, 1789 adheres to the original contract, it does not deviate from it. The Legi&s;lature of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> on the 27th of March, 1789, found the Con&s;titution thus adopted and ready to be put in execution, it con&s;equently found the fund liable to be withdrawn, it found the United States able to do ju&s;tice to her own creditors. The people their con&s;tituents who &s;urely included the creditors had a&s;&s;ented to the &s;ubtraction of the fund from their fir&s;t application. In adherence therefore to the original con|tract,
<PB N="347" REF="027132_0355_0FD351B84AABA8B0">
they confirmed the payment of intere&s;t during the intermediate interval from the fir&s;t &s;teps taken by <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> to the ce&s;&s;ation of the fund: They termi|nated the payment from that time afterwards.</P>
<P>In the great &s;cale upon which this ought to be con|&s;idered, the difference of a few months is not to be re|garded: The fund cea&s;ed the 1&s;t Augu&s;t, 1789, four months after the pa&s;&s;ing of the Act, when the General Government took place.</P>
<P>If the Act of March, 1789 was inactive and wanted efficacy until that time, it then received it, the original contract was terminated. After that, none who agreed to the federal Con&s;titution can oppo&s;e this con&s;truction. This &s;ubject was ably handled by the young gentleman (Mr. <HI>Gib&s;on)</HI> who &s;poke la&s;t, who&s;e talents exhibited on this occa&s;ion are an honour to him&s;elf, and promi&s;e to be an ornament to his country.</P>
<P>The Act of March 1789 repealed part of the law of March 1786, the law of 1786 repealed that of 1785.</P>
<P>After the pa&s;&s;ing of the Act of March 1789 nothing of the Act of 1786 remained except what related to the payment of intere&s;t: For by that Act three things were to be done, 1. Receiving certificates on loan; 2. Delivering out New-Loans in exchange for others. 3. The payment of intere&s;t; the loan clo&s;ed with the Act of March 1789, after that time no certificates could be i&s;&s;ued, certificates i&s;&s;ued by the Comptroller-General after that period are unwarranted by law. I&s;&s;uing was unnece&s;&s;ary, the Act of March 1789 is explained and arguments again&s;t our po&s;ition are an&s;wered by this ex|planation.</P>
<P>The Act of March 1786 was only a loan, it is &s;o declared in every part of the bill. The obligation ari&s;ing from a loan is ended with the re&s;titution of the thing loaned. <HI>A.</HI> lends <HI>B.</HI> certificates to be paid the 1&s;t of May, <HI>B.</HI> returns the certificates, the loan is ended. Therefore the State is di&s;charged on the return of the Continental certificates, (Mr. <HI>Rawle</HI> then adverted to the certificates and the length of time, and it was ac|knowledged
<PB N="348" REF="027132_0356_0FD35108F4BD1170">
by <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> as a loan to be returned by the fir&s;t March 1796, or &s;ooner if convenient, and then the whole contract to be at an end, the four year's intere&s;t being paid.)</P>
<P>Sir, It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed the Legi&s;lature of <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania</HI> intended to go farther in 1786 than they meant to go in 1785.</P>
<P>In the &s;ummer of 1786 the Convention met at <HI>Anna|polis;</HI> on the 30th December &s;ame year delegates were appointed to the General Convention; at this time a federal Union was expected; the an&s;wer returned by the A&s;&s;embly, 27th December 1786, to Congre&s;s is not &s;urpri&s;ing, (&s;ee page 319, 320).</P>
<P>We do then aver, that the Act of March 1786 was only a loan, little comment need be made on the enact|ing clau&s;es of the law, as the only engagement pre|tended was not to di&s;charge the principal, but to ad|vance the intere&s;t on account of the United States: The Act of March 1789 in unequivocal terms puts an end to that part of the contract, and therefore the New-Loans were not &s;ub&s;cribable to the loan opened by Con|gre&s;s. He certified them to be &s;ub&s;cribable, we aver the contrary. The public debt of the United States in June 1790 was divided into three cla&s;&s;es, 1. Foreign, 2. Dome&s;tic, and 3. State debt.</P>
<P>The foreign debt was &s;omething more than ten mil|lions: The dome&s;tic debt was about forty or fifty mil|lions. Of the State debts an e&s;timate cannot ea&s;ily be made. To the que&s;tion what debts were intended to be a&s;&s;umed by Congre&s;s, circum&s;tanced as the Union then was, it was propo&s;ed to a&s;&s;ume the State debts; and to the que&s;tion, <HI>What were the State debts?</HI> the an&s;wer is obvious, debts at that <HI>time</HI> due by the State.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Rawle</HI> then read the 13th &s;ection of the Act of Congre&s;s 4th Augu&s;t 1790, entitled "An Act making provi&s;ion for the debt of the United States," the &s;um a&s;&s;umed being 21,500,000 dollars. The two general heads of SERVICES and SUPPLIES de&s;cribe the con&s;ide|ration, no other certificates admi&s;&s;ible; and the expre&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="349" REF="027132_0357_0FD3510B4316AA28">
in the Act, "debts by them re&s;pectively owing," therefore a debt of that kind would embarra&s;s indivi|dual States if the fund was withdrawn; <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> had then a peculiar and proper debt, and unle&s;s the vacant land and the Continental certificates had afforded a fund, &s;he would be con&s;iderably embarra&s;&s;ed, the magnitude of her debt is not ea&s;ily a&s;certained now, if under&s;tood at fir&s;t; the holders had no other to look to, &s;etting a&s;ide the bills of credit: the amount of funded and unfunded depreciation certificates was about four or five hundred thou&s;and pounds of our money, the&s;e were admitted into the general cla&s;s as being i&s;&s;ued for &s;ervices or &s;upplies in pro&s;ecuting the war and for the expences incurred during the general conflict.</P>
<P>The New-Loans were not within this de&s;cription, they were only available to withdraw the Continental certifi|cates, and four year's intere&s;t; this is the fact, &s;o far as we can gather the evidences of the intentions of the Legi&s;lature, and as far as we can collect a knowledge of our finances from the laws of our country.</P>
<P>The commonwealth was under no obligation to re|deem the New-Loans.</P>
<P>Certificates, therefore originally loaned were divided into two cla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P N="1">1. Tho&s;e which were the property of the State from the New-Loans having been laid out in the purcha&s;e of land.</P>
<P N="2">2. Tho&s;e which were to be pre&s;ented to the holders pre&s;enting the New-Loan certificate for re-exchange.</P>
<P>By the Act of 7th April 1791, no officer of your commonwealth by the Acts of your Legi&s;lature could &s;ub&s;cribe State debts. Her Continental certificates were an incumbrance to her until the New-Loan certificates were brought forward on the dome&s;tic loan.</P>
<P>Two days afterwards, the 9th April 1791, the pur|part Act was pa&s;&s;ed by the Legi&s;lature; if the State of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> con&s;idered New-Loans as a debt, and &s;ub|&s;cribable &s;he would have included them in that law. The Act of 30th March 1791 by which the Trea&s;urer
<PB N="350" REF="027132_0358_0FD3515B5AC5AEF8">
is directed to &s;ub&s;cribe, refers to and depends upon the provi&s;ion of the Act 1&s;t April 1790. By the Act of April 1, 1790 it had been directed that they &s;hould be depo&s;ited with the State-Trea&s;urer: could he part from them without the order of the Legi&s;lature? It was not till the 30th March 1791 that an application was made of them. Then they were &s;ub&s;cribed, not to the State, but to the dome&s;tic loan.</P>
<P>By this expo&s;ition it is manife&s;t that the law of the 27th March 1789 repealed every former provi&s;ion, and that the New-Loan certificates were only a demand to get back the Continental certificates and for equalizing the intere&s;t for four years.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not con&s;ider the Con&s;titution of the United States, &s;o far as relates to the Acts of a State with its own citizens; no contract was impaired, no <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> law had been pa&s;&s;ed; it is not nece&s;&s;ary on our part to introduce any con&s;ideration about it.</P>
<P>Yet in a charge of an highly criminal nature &s;ome extenuation is &s;ought in the endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h that this was not a &s;ingle con&s;truction of the law; but that others, who&s;e judgments were not perverted by any corrupt motives, were of the &s;ame opinion; that the &s;ame opinion was entertained by the principal officers of the United States' Trea&s;ury. If our con&s;truction is right, contrary opinions are erroneous; but had he, with all the light that ought to have been communicated to him, held the &s;ame opinion, what &s;helter can the mi&s;|conduct of one officer find in the error of another. It is not uncommon to ju&s;tify the culpable tran&s;actions of &s;ome by the erroneous judgments of other individuals; if they do not mean this as an extenuation, it is intended as a ju&s;tification, if not de&s;igned as one, or the other, it ought not to be brought forward at all.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Rawle</HI> then a&s;ked, whether the opinion of the Secretary of the United States, a mo&s;t re&s;pectable officer, &s;hould be a ju&s;tification and a proof of the inno|cence of the defendant, whereas the Secretary renounced his former opinion on being better informed, this in|formation
<PB N="351" REF="027132_0359_0FD351B9C1D22BD8">
ought to have been furni&s;hed by the Compt|roller-General. This opinion of the Secretary &s;hould not be depended upon, ina&s;much as he renounced the &s;ame on better information.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Rawle</HI> then read, commented, and made remarks on the circular letter of Mr. <HI>A. Hamilton</HI> to the Gover|nors of the re&s;pective States, (&s;ee page 275-6). Then on letter <HI>Dallas</HI> to <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> (page 276)&mdash;then on letter (page 102-3)&mdash;then letter <HI>Dallas</HI> to <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> (page 220)&mdash;then letter Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> to Governor (page 220-1-2)&mdash;then on letter Mr. <HI>Dallas</HI> to Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> (page 277)&mdash;then on letter Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> to Mr. <HI>Hamil|ton,</HI> (page 277)&mdash;then on letter Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> to Mr. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> (page 278).</P>
<P>So far as the&s;e communications extend, it is apparent from the evidence or te&s;timony of the Secretary (&s;ee his te&s;timony page 287-8-9) that no information of the repealing law of the 27th March 1789 was ever brought before him in a <HI>"prominent point of view."</HI> When that was known, an arrangement immediately took place and the re&s;ult is known;&mdash;Mr. <HI>Rawle</HI> then read the letter from Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI> to Mr. <HI>Dallas,</HI> (page 76-7-8-9).</P>
<P>It is well known that the Comptroller-General was the only officer of the commonwealth, who had com|municated with the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury on this &s;ubject;&mdash;Mr. <HI>Rawle</HI> then read the following letter:&mdash;</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Rawle</HI> then read the letter from Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI> to the Governor, (page 218, 219).</P>
<P>The foregoing letters were commented upon in a &s;uitable manner by Mr. <HI>Rawle,</HI> and he added;&mdash;</P>
<P>It is then clear that the New-Loans were never &s;tated by the Comptroller or Regi&s;ter-General as an exi&s;ting State debt after the Act of the 27th March 1789&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding all this we find the Comptroller-General forgetting his official duty, and in 1792 certi|fying the&s;e New-Loans to be <HI>genuine and a&s;&s;umable;</HI> the large ab&s;tract is not certified by Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> to be <HI>genuine</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;umable;</HI> but the Senate well recollects, that the end for which it was intended was vi&s;ible, the 30th of June was the la&s;t day of &s;ub&s;cription, the cer|tificates of <HI>John Oldden</HI> were &s;ub&s;cribed by the Compt|roller-General as late as the 9th of July, altering the date to hit the purpo&s;es, when the laws would not war|rant the redemption of any; his omi&s;&s;ion of certifying <HI>genuine</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;umable</HI> in his own ca&s;e is a proof of more increa&s;ed dexterity, than any excu&s;e can be a defence.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t the fir&s;t article of impeachment is fully &s;up|ported, the motives which render the&s;e tran&s;actions &s;o culpable, and the inference of the&s;e motives &s;hall be con&s;idered hereafter.</P>

<PB N="353" REF="027132_0361_0FD3510EB86B8EC8">
<HEAD>THE SECOND ARTICLE.</HEAD>
<P>In the preceding article of impeachment a charge of practices indirectly, and con&s;equently pernicious to <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> have been compri&s;ed; in this we trace the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion in direct oppo&s;ition with her laws, and operating mo&s;t immediately and unequivocally to her di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>Here again the pro&s;ecution commences with an aver|ment of a fact for which we only pray the candid in|ve&s;tigation of the law: It is averred that New-Loans were not &s;pecified and could not be contemplated as objects of redemption; that they were not &s;pecified requires only a peru&s;al of the Act.</P>
<P>(The &s;econd &s;ection of the Act of 10th April 1792 was then read.)</P>
<P>That the New-Loan certificates could not be contem|plated by any fair unprejudiced and unbia&s;&s;ed mind is not difficult to be e&s;tabli&s;hed; that they are not mention|ed in the &s;econd &s;ection is apparent; as they were not included in the &s;econd &s;ection, the &s;ixth &s;ection ought not to be pre&s;&s;ed into their &s;ervice as an auxiliary.</P>
<P>The loans on the part of the United States were directed to be opened on the fir&s;t of October 1790, and to continue open until the 30th September 1791.</P>
<P><HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> was then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a large portion of United States' debt, which the Trea&s;urer was directed to &s;ub&s;cribe by the 30th March 1791: It was believed that <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> would be a creditor of the Union.</P>
<P>(Mr. <HI>Rawle</HI> glanced at the te&s;timony of Mr. <HI>Don|nald&s;on,</HI> which &s;ee la&s;t paragraph, page 292,) this has been &s;tated by Mr. <HI>Gib&s;on,</HI> (&s;ee page 334.)</P>
<P>It was doubted whether the balance due to this com|monwealth would be punctually paid, as the &s;ub&s;cription of every dollar of her own debt was an a&s;&s;umption of the payment of it by the United States, it was con&s;i|dered as ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntere&s;t that the State creditors &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was contemplated that &s;he would other|wi&s;e remain encumbered with her own claims, at the &s;ame time that &s;he might be an hopele&s;s creditor of the
<PB N="354" REF="027132_0362_0FD351895EDE8AC8">
Union; but as the manner of funding the State debt would not have yielded to the State creditor a benefit commen&s;urate with that en&s;uing to the State, as &s;he was relieved from the payment of 6 per cents. by a mea&s;ure which yielded to them only 4 per cent.; an Act was pa&s;&s;ed the 9th of April 1791 inviting her own creditors to accede to the United States' loan by engag|ing to compen&s;ate them for their lo&s;s. This Act had its effect, &s;ub&s;criptions took place to the amount of &pound;. 252,697: And purpart certificates were i&s;&s;ued to the amount of &pound;. 136,543.</P>
<P>In December 1791 the Legi&s;lature beheld with &s;a|tisfaction the wealth and pro&s;perity of the State, differ|ing from the author of the plan of finance, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the Act of the 10th of April 1792&mdash;the State being then only encumbered with the intere&s;t on funded and unfunded depreciation debt, funded debt, dollar money and purparts.</P>
<P>Far from thinking a public debt, attended with &s;uffi|cient advantages, either nece&s;&s;ary to procure her im|portance in the Union, or to attach her own citizens to her intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>To counterbalance the&s;e inconveniences, they de|termined to make u&s;e of the means to relieve her incumbrances at once, they re&s;olved to &s;ell &s;o much of her 3 per cent. &s;tock at 12 &s;hillings in the pound, or &pound;.60 per cent. as would di&s;charge all her debts: It was propo&s;ed by the Legi&s;lature fairly to purcha&s;e the &s;ub&s;criptions of tho&s;e of her own State creditors men|tioned in the &s;econd article who would &s;ub&s;cribe; the law it&s;elf ju&s;tifies this con&s;truction, and manife&s;tly nega|tives the con&s;truction attempted to be given to the &s;ixth &s;ection. In the law, as it now &s;tands without any alter|ation, the &s;ixth &s;ection is a provi&s;o to the &s;econd &s;ection, this we have in the te&s;timony of Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> (&s;ee page 295-6-7-8.) The fifth &s;ection directs the payment by the State-Trea&s;urer on or before the fir&s;t of July &s;ame year; the 6th &s;ection goes on to &s;tate that they &s;hall be entitled to the nominal value from the Trea&s;urer
<PB N="355" REF="027132_0363_0FD351BB934BAE98">
upon condition that they &s;hall &s;ub&s;cribe to the loan, and transfer to the u&s;e of the State-Trea&s;urer.</P>
<P>Now, no other law exi&s;ts authori&s;ing the State-Trea|&s;urer to pay the nominal value, and no other mode of effectuating the payment but by warrants drawn by the Governor, payable out of this fund: The Governor derives his authority from the fifth &s;ection in reference to the &s;econd; but no additional clau&s;e, no authority is given to draw in execution of the &s;ixth.</P>
<P>It follows therefore that the intention was, that, if the loan re-opened, the &s;econd &s;ection was only to be executed as the parties &s;hould comply with the &s;ixth &s;ection.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh &s;ection more clearly exhibits the views of the Legi&s;lature; it requires the holders of every cer|tificate intended to be redeemed to apply before the fir&s;t of July, and after that time all intere&s;t &s;hall cea&s;e, but if no &s;ale, nor notification, intere&s;t &s;hall continue: Now it is notorious that New-Loans did not bear an intere&s;t of 6 per cent.; it is therefore con&s;equently obvious they were not included in this provi&s;ion: Yet this is ex|pre&s;sly extended to all the certificates intended to be redeemed; it follows New-Loans were not intended to be redeemed. If a member of the Legi&s;lature was to be a&s;ked by one of his con&s;tituents, "What did you mean by this Act?" the an&s;wer is obvious, "Read the &s;eventh &s;ection."</P>
<P>They contend that the &s;ixth is a &s;eparate and ab&s;olute provi&s;ion; if &s;o, nothing is more true, than what proves too much, proves nothing at all.</P>
<P>Read it in this point of view. (The &s;ixth &s;ection then read.) What is its effect? An engagement that they will pay to every holder of State certificates from New-<HI>Hamp&s;hire</HI> to <HI>Georgia</HI> the nominal value of his cer|tificates!</P>
<P>No peculiar mention of the <HI>State creditors</HI> of <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania!</HI></P>
<P>A con&s;truction liable and &s;ubject to &s;uch ob&s;ervations ought to be rejected, and mu&s;t be laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="027132_0364_0FD3515E3A9285A8">The &s;ixth &s;ection don't controul to the exclu&s;ion of, but is a condition annexed to the &s;econd &s;ection.</P>
<P>Here it is difficult to reconcile the conduct and know|ledge of the Comptroller-General with Mr. <HI>Gallatin's</HI> communication, (&s;ee his te&s;timony, page 295, &amp;c.) as Comptroller-General it forms no matter of exculpation that he was able to catch the State in an error, altho' a third per&s;on might take advantage, Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> as Comptroller-General ought not to catch her in this error in which &s;he did not intend to fall.</P>

<P>"IT is evident that the Legi&s;lature intended to make a general &s;ettlement with the creditors of the State upon the principles expre&s;&s;ed in the Act of the 10th in&s;tant, and con&s;equently a partial &s;ale of &s;tock, or a partial commutation of State debt for &s;tock, will not ju&s;tify my i&s;&s;uing a notification, which, by the terms of the law, mu&s;t be addre&s;&s;ed indi&s;criminately to all the holders of the &s;pecified certificates and bills of credit, requiring them to comply with the conditions of the redemption. But if the offers to purcha&s;e &s;tock and to commute the debt at the rate pre&s;cribed, &s;hall, together, be commen&s;urate to the aggregate amount of the certificates and bills of credit, which are to be redeemed, I conceive that, without violating the &s;pirit of the Act of A&s;&s;embly, the object of the arrangement

<P>"You will be plea&s;ed, therefore, to extend the period for receiving propo&s;als, and to accept all that may be made in either of the&s;e forms, until the requi&s;ite &s;um is obtained.

<P>"IN con&s;equence of the doubt, which you have &s;ugge&s;ted, I am directed by the Governor to inform you, that when he a&s;&s;ented to the idea of the State debts being received on the &s;ales of &s;tock, it was upon this principle, that it &s;hould be con&s;idered and e&s;timated as ca&s;h, at its nominal value; beyond which nominal value, and the rates in particular ca&s;es pre&s;cribed by the Act of A&s;&s;embly, he is not authori&s;ed, upon the redemption, nor, con&s;equently, through the medium of a commutation to liquidate the demands upon the public.</P>
<P>"A fund commen&s;urate to the whole amount of the debt to be redeemed, mu&s;t be e&s;tabli&s;hed, before the Governor can i&s;&s;ue his notification; and it is certainly immaterial, whether that fund is &s;atisfied by &s;pecie pay|ments, or by depo&s;its as ca&s;h, in the public &s;ecurities, for which the &s;pecie is to be rai&s;ed: but the Governor conceives, that it would be contrary to the &s;pirit of the law, to an impartial di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice, and to the public intere&s;t, were the propo&s;als to be accepted, &s;o that the payments by way of commutation &s;hould be con&s;idered as ca&s;h, in order to entitle the parties to a transfer of the three per cent. &s;tock, and al&s;o as a de|po&s;it in order, to entitle them to intere&s;t until the expi|ration of the time, which the notice &s;hall limit for the general redemption.</P>
<P>"By an arrangement of this nature, a di&s;crimination is not only introduced between the purcha&s;ers of the &s;tock for ca&s;h, and tho&s;e who purcha&s;e with State debt, to the great benefit of the Latter cla&s;s; but it will like|wi&s;e
<PB N="360" REF="027132_0368_0FD351629FAE9C68">
operate with &s;imilar inequality in relation to all tho&s;e State creditors, who cannot have the opportunity of &s;ettling their claims by way of commutation; the State, too, will not only lo&s;e the current intere&s;t on the 3 per cent. &s;tock; but be precluded from the advantage of an immediate &s;ettlement with &s;uch of her creditors as &s;hall be di&s;po&s;ed to anticipate the period, for which the notification mu&s;t i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>Such have uniformly been the Governor's &s;entiments; but, if by any means they have been mi&s;under&s;tood, he would rather relinqui&s;h all advantage from the pre|&s;ent propo&s;als than &s;uffer any cau&s;e of complaint to exi&s;t: He reque&s;ts, therefore, that you will be plea&s;ed to confer with the parties, on the &s;ubject; and to inform them, that they may now make their election, either to abide by their propo&s;als upon the terms which I have &s;tated, or to withdraw them.

</LETTER>
<P>This la&s;t letter &s;hews no particular &s;ale in contempla|tion, the &s;ale of &s;tock was to be commen&s;urate to the whole amount of debt to be redeemed.</P>
<P>(Mr. <HI>Rawle</HI> then quoted the Act of A&s;&s;embly of the 4th April 1792, page 218, which directs the manner of &s;ettling the public accounts;) by this it is mani|fe&s;t that it was the duty of the Comptroller-General to have informed the Regi&s;ter-General, it was their joint duty to draw, and certify the fund, that the Go|vernor might draw his warrant on the State-Trea&s;urer with propriety. Nay, they were to certify jointly: No excu&s;e can be brought in ju&s;tification of his conduct for keeping the Governor ignorant of the tran&s;action. This is a new &s;pecies of defence &s;et up by the coun&s;el for the Comptroller-General.

Some debts were to be redeemed by the Act of the 10th of April 1792&mdash; <HI>What State debts?</HI> Why! only tho&s;e debts which were included in the e&s;timate which had been furni&s;hed by the two officers, the Comptroller and Regi&s;ter-General. &mdash;Here it may be nece&s;&s;ary to advert to his own name being u&s;ed;&mdash;I an&s;wer, when the <HI>mea&s;ure</HI> is concealed, no matter about the <HI>man.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE FOURTH ARTICLE.</HEAD>
<P>This article charges the Comptroller-General with a breach of the Con&s;titution, here no &s;helter can be found in the ambiguity or contradiction of the law, it is a direct violation of a &s;ingle clau&s;e in a plain and explicit in&s;trument; accordingly the endeavour is not to oppo&s;e but to e&s;cape the charge.</P>
<P>A&s;toni&s;hing to hear, that a warrant expre&s;sly to be paid out of a fund created by the Act of the 10th April 1792, and actually &s;o paid by the Trea&s;urer, and &s;o reported to the Legi&s;lature by the Governor&mdash;is to be protected from reprehen&s;ion by quartering it on an|other fund previou&s;ly appropriated by law to other objects, and altho' his warrants are expre&s;sly drawn and paid <HI>out of the fund</HI> provided by the Act of 10th April 1792, they were drawn out of the fund e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Act of the 7th April 1791&mdash;and not out of the fund provided by the Act of 10th April 1792.</P>
<P>By the Act of the 26th March 1789, &pound;.10,000 were &s;et apart for claims and improvements; that this has always been con&s;idered a peculiar fund, and appropri|ated to tho&s;e ca&s;es which did not belong to any par|ticular cla&s;s, and as &s;uch I &s;hall &s;hew the &s;entiments of the Comptroller-General upon it, in an official &s;tate|ment under his own hand.</P>
<P>(Mr. <HI>Rawle</HI> read a part of the Comptroller's report, page 386, Minutes December 11, 1790, as follows, to wit:)</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="027132_0370_0FD35176F0496F58">"There is another &s;pecies of expence called claims, which cannot properly be arranged under the debts of the State, and which is certain in its amount, as it de|pends on the grants of the Legi&s;lature at the time, and not on accounts adju&s;ted upon fixed principles. The &s;um of &pound;. 5,000 annually is appropriated by Act of March 26th and 28th September 1789, and is con&s;ti|tuted as a fund for this purpo&s;e. It may be worthy the con&s;ideration of the Legi&s;lature, whether &s;uch a fund is not likely to beget many improper applications, and whether, after the State hath, by an Act of limita|tion, barred even un&s;ettled claims which would have been legal, &s;uch an invitation &s;hould continue to be held out."</P>
<P>The&s;e claims (the defendant ob&s;erved) were likely to beget "improper applications," nothing in this pro|vi&s;ion relative to the Act of April 1791: No New-Loans could be redeemed under that law, nor any claim on that fund.</P>
<P>But an unexpected effort is made to defend, which requires further con&s;ideration, the charge is, that he cau&s;ed money to be drawn from the Trea&s;ury without a previous appropriation by law.</P>
<P>Not a &s;ingle in&s;tance can be produced which will &s;hew, that where a warrant has been drawn on a fund, to which it was not applicable, the &s;ame &s;hould be paid out of the twelfth appropriation of the 7th April 1791. (Some warrants were then produced, and read by Mr. <HI>Rawle,</HI> to e&s;tabli&s;h his po&s;ition, contained in the la&s;t &s;entence.)</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;tion by</HI> Mr. <HI>Bingham to</HI> Mr. <HI>Rawle.</HI> Do you &s;ay, that the fund included in the Act of the 26th March 1789 is embraced in the Act of April 1791?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Yes&mdash;as far as the 12th appropriation extends.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;. by the &s;ame.</HI> Is the Act of March 1789 a part of the Act of April 1791?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> No. By the Act of the 7th April 1791 all the revenues of the State were collected into one ma&s;s, and formed an aggregate fund towards paying the debts
<PB N="363" REF="027132_0371_0FD3511883E471D8">
and obligations of the commonwealth, and finally to pay all warrants drawn for claims and improvements.</P>
<P>It was with great propriety the warrant in favour of Mr. <HI>Rittenhou&s;e</HI> of the 27th September 1791 was paid out of the fund for claims and improvements.</P>
<P>That warrants were drawn without a &s;pecification of the funds, in the ca&s;e of Dr. <HI>Hutchin&s;on</HI> and others after verdicts in the Supreme Court: Was this agreeable to law? In the &s;econd &s;ection of the Act of the 4th April 1792 the duty of the Comptroller and Regi&s;ter are defined, where it is enacted that the balance and fund &s;hould be certified by them to the Governor, and a warrant &s;hould i&s;&s;ue accordingly.</P>
<P>Can his conduct on this occa&s;ion be ju&s;tified? Can this tran&s;action be pre&s;&s;ed, as a defence, into the &s;ervice of the Comptroller-General?</P>
<P>(Mr. <HI>Lewis</HI> interrupted Mr. <HI>Rawle</HI> at this time, and de&s;ired him to produce the warrants. Whereupon the warrant No. 14 for unfunded depreciation debt, was read, and &s;hewn that it was not certified to be payable <HI>out of the fund</HI> of the 10th April 1792, but that it was payable <HI>per Act</HI> of the 10th April 1792, and the following letter.)</P>

<P>&rindx; The &s;tatement con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix certificates a|mounting in the whole to ten thou&s;and five hundred and &s;eventy-eight dollars and ten cents.</P>
<P>By the&s;e it was evident unfunded depreciation was not included in the e&s;timate.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="027132_0372_0FD3511A00348550">The Governor did not know that unfunded deprecia|tion were included, nor could it appear to him that there were any others but tho&s;e directed to be redeemed by the fir&s;t e&s;timate and expre&s;sly connected with it.</P>
<P>Had the conduct of the Comptroller-General on the&s;e occa&s;ions been otherwi&s;e, no impeachment would ever have lain again&s;t him.</P>
<P>I will reduce the remaining three articles into two as conci&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, the fifth and &s;ixth I will con&s;ider together as the &s;ame evidence applies to both.</P>
<P>(Mr. <HI>Rawle</HI> read the fifth and &s;ixth articles of im|peachment.)</P>
<P>The fifth &s;tates in general terms the final objects of the labours to which the preceding articles refer.</P>
<P>That the plan of finance (which &s;ee page 280) was not laid for others, when only &pound;.20,000 was e&s;timated to be out, that he purcha&s;ed to &s;o great an amount, it mu&s;t be acknowledged that he was indu&s;trious. (Mr. <HI>Rawle</HI> explained the bu&s;ine&s;s re&s;pecting the certifi|cate of Dr. <HI>Hutchin&s;on</HI> and others, as not connected with this bu&s;ine&s;s.) With regard to the &s;ixth article of impeachment that he &s;ub&s;cribed for his own u&s;e the certificates received to be exchanged.</P>
<P>It is &s;urprizing that &s;uch a quantum of evidence hath been procured. His coun&s;el do not deny the charge, but the inference, and contend to ju&s;tify the tran&s;action.</P>
<P>That the Comptroller-General led the way is appa|rent; 1. Mr. <HI>Oldden</HI> a principal broker is at a lo&s;s to divine what u&s;e the defendant intended them for. 2. Mr. <HI>Boggs</HI> certifies New-Loans ro&s;e in price, and unable to know what for. But Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Evans, Hale</HI> and <HI>Stroud</HI> have been produced to prove that the New-Loan certificates have been taken back, after they were lodged for re-exchange. The charge is, that the Comptroller-General made propo&s;als to purcha&s;e, and did actually purcha&s;e from per&s;ons bringing certificates to his office to be re-exchanged. Is this an an&s;wer to the charge? The que&s;tion is not whether on an alteration of their
<PB N="365" REF="027132_0373_0FD351C0C3E95BA8">
minds, they took back their certificates after having lodged them with him.</P>
<P>But the charge is, that a &s;teward of the public reve|nue is accu&s;ed of having prevented an exchange which the party was de&s;irous to make, and which it was his duty to accelerate, by which the State &s;uffered a con&s;i|derable lo&s;s: And the defence is that in other in&s;tances wholly indifferent to the public, <HI>he,</HI> and not another officer a&s;&s;ented to the parties receiving back, at their own reque&s;t their own certificates for private purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>The la&s;t article is certainly of too &s;erious and too plain a nature to be viewed with indifference. We have Mr. <HI>M'Connell's</HI> te&s;timony that he &s;old that certificate to Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan;</HI> Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan's</HI> te&s;timony proves that he never &s;old any certificates nor had any private dealings with the Comptroller-General in his life, ex|cept the advance of &s;ome indents. That he delivered all the certificates which he had to Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on;</HI> that he is of imperfect memory that this certificate was of the number; that on the 15th September 1790 he drew intere&s;t on this certificate. As Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> never commuted with him, nor had any other dealings with the Comptroller, he is put to prove how he came by this &s;u&s;picious certificate.</P>
<P>The Comptroller-General brings his books of ex|changes, dates, numbers and &s;ums are not apparent on the face of them.</P>
<P>Twenty-&s;ix of the&s;e certificates united without dates, &amp;c. make up &pound;.26,000 which is No. 183; forty-five certificates make up &pound;.27,000, No. 184.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Mansfield</HI> ob&s;erves, all evidence <HI>(Couper,</HI> 65,) is to be weighed according to what one party can pro|duce, and is in the power of the other to contradict.</P>
<P>We are not to make te&s;timony but to find it; if any imputation is thrown on <HI>Blair M'Clenachan,</HI> we did not &s;elect him, but his te&s;timony &s;hould however have this effect, that it de&s;erves a better an&s;wer than hath been yet given to it by the Comptroller-General.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="027132_0374_0FD327F2D8139AD0">This impeachment hath not been precipitated, it is now almo&s;t twelve months &s;ince it commenced; the Comptroller-General has had full lei&s;ure for the collec|tion of official documents nece&s;&s;ary for him: Having al|ready taken notice of a great part of his defence, it only remains to notice two circum&s;tances adduced by his coun&s;el.</P>
<P N="1">1. His innocence is to be inferred from his open and avowed &s;entiments at former periods relative to the nature of New-Loans; (Mr. <HI>Rawle</HI> then adverted to the Comptroller's letter, December 24, 1791, page 220-1-2, his letter to Mr. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> page 278, and his letter to Mr. <HI>Mifflin,</HI> page 223-4.)</P>
<P>The unvaried tenor of opinion is certainly evidence of its &s;incerity&mdash;but when we find the &s;ame man, at or near the &s;ame period of time, and under the &s;ame circum&s;tances delivering opinions diametrically oppo|&s;ite, we are led to enquire which of the two occa&s;ions required the mo&s;t &s;erious reflection.</P>
<P>But in the official document, 30th November, 1791, all the claims again&s;t the commonwealth are mentioned and &s;tated; New-Loans are omitted, yet they are not altogether too inferior objects of notice, as &pound;. 600 ar|rearages of intere&s;t on them are mentioned.</P>
<P>It will not be pretended that he intended to mi&s;lead the Legi&s;lature or the Governor; and it will not be pretended that the nature of the &s;tatement precluded the mention of the principal of the New-Loans: For, 1. It is an account of "claims," and he profe&s;&s;es to have always con&s;idered this as a claim. 2. The prin|cipal of other claims was noticed by him, &s;uch as funded and unfunded depreciation debt, pen&s;ions, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Yet while on this &s;trong ground, this important pe|riod of the 10th April 1792, it does not in all his cor|re&s;pondence appear that practical views, his avowed opinion, his morti&s;ing and inlaying of New-Loans into the compo&s;ition of the fund for redeeming State debts, &s;o as to make all appear of one piece was ever commu|nicated to any one; no intimation that the redemption
<PB N="367" REF="027132_0375_0FD351C2CB7DBA08">
of New-Loans was practicable altho' that was the time to have avowed the &s;entiment.</P>
<P>This was however (as Mr. <HI>Tilghman</HI> &s;ays) authori&s;ed by the &s;ecret and avowed objects of &s;peculation.</P>
<P N="2">2. That &s;ome of the Acts in que&s;tion, being lawful to others were lawful to the Comptroller-General.</P>
<P>This is important and attacks the ba&s;is of &s;ome of the articles of impeachment. I con&s;ider it as applica|ble to his purcha&s;es of <HI>Oldden,</HI> and <HI>Biddle;</HI> his avow|edly pur&s;uing what he profe&s;&s;ed to &s;uppo&s;e the literal con&s;truction of the law of April 10, 1792, in oppo&s;ition to what he knew to be the meaning of the Legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>The intere&s;t of the commonwealth, the happine&s;s and &s;ucce&s;s of a republic depend on the de&s;truction of this unworthy principle.</P>
<P>It is an axiom, nece&s;&s;ary for our pro&s;perity, and al|mo&s;t in&s;eparable from our exi&s;tence, that a public officer &s;hould have no intere&s;t oppo&s;ed to that of the public: Perverting public offices to private emolument was one of the principal cau&s;es of the downfall of one of the greate&s;t commonwealths in the world.</P>
<P>In this grand national view, I will not de&s;cend to the jealous &s;uperintendance of courts of chancery over executors, guardians and tru&s;tees.</P>
<P>You, who are here collected, and delegated to decide this national enquiry, will never forget, that &s;olemn obligation are derived from important tru&s;ts; and that whoever &s;tipulates faithfully to &s;erve the public, &s;tipu|lates to renounce every per&s;onal advantage incompa|tible with the public intere&s;t.</P>
<P>It is therefore, for a breach of this engagement he is accu&s;ed&mdash;an offence which in all times has been de|nounced as requiring adequate puni&s;hment. 2. <HI>Wood|de&s;on,</HI> 602.</P>
<P>I fear no contradiction in &s;aying, that had <HI>John Ni|chol&s;on</HI> in 1782, when about to take the oath "faith|fully to &s;erve the commonwealth," and to execute the office of Comptroller-General, declared his con&s;truction of it to be, that he was at liberty to pur&s;ue his opinion

of the letter of the law in oppo&s;ition to what he knew to be the intention of the Legi&s;lature.&mdash;That he would claim the privilege of private men to prefer his own intere&s;t to that of the public, and that he would avail him&s;elf of his official opportunities for &s;o doing&mdash;he would be rejected with di&s;gu&s;t and without he&s;itation.

<HEAD>Eleventh day of the trial. <HI>TUESDAY, MARCH 11.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Court being called, &amp;c. as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>MR. HIGGINSON.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Senate,</HI></P>
<P>THE Senate of the commonwealth of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> is called upon by the Con&s;titution to execute one of their mo&s;t important functions, that is, A TRIAL BY IMPEACHMENT.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives being the mo&s;t po|pular branch have exerci&s;ed their juri&s;diction in prefer|ring the charges again&s;t <HI>John Nichol&s;on,</HI> the Compt|roller-General: This important right devolves upon you, who&s;e part is the more difficult as you have to decide and are &s;et as judges over this individual, your tribunal is the greate&s;t in the land; being thus con&s;tituted, you have to rea&s;on with capacity; the chain is compo&s;ed of mixed bu&s;ine&s;s, habits of intima|cy, and principles of confidence between the two bran|ches, and &s;ympathy for each other, a mere &s;ugge&s;tion of the danger is &s;ufficient to de&s;troy the exi&s;tence of the danger.</P>
<P>Having premi&s;ed this hint to you, his judges, permit me to &s;ay that the defendant has every thing that is va|luable at &s;take, his reputation is at i&s;&s;ue by this accu&s;a|tion; if rumour &s;pread through every corner of the &s;tate, if the public opinion, envenomed by prejudice, if reports of guilt and torrents of prejudice, rou&s;ed and fomented by malice, and fo&s;tered by envy, are &s;ufficient to condemn a man, the defendant is already brought to judgment.</P>
<P>Yet the impartiality of the tribunal will &s;ecure the
<PB N="370" REF="027132_0378_0FD3513B6E05E7F8">
officer from condemnation on any other ground than that of a fair trial according to the evidence.</P>
<P>We have heard great panegyricks be&s;towed on im|peachment trials in <HI>England,</HI> but hi&s;tory affords but few examples of &s;uch trials being any other than pro&s;ecutions, oppre&s;&s;ive and violent, and ending in corrupt deci&s;ions.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent trial, I hope, will be different in ma|nagement and deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>The articles of impeachment are divi&s;ible into two cla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The 1&s;t is &s;ubdivi&s;ible into four cla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The 2d is of a different nature and &s;cope, and con|&s;equently worthy of different con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Upon this, two points ari&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t&punc; Whether our con&s;truction hath been right or wrong.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. If not conformable to law, whether it had not been our hone&s;t faith and good opinion.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, If New-Loan certificates were &s;ub&s;cribable to the loan opened under the Act of the general govern|ment.</P>
<P N="2">2d. If redeemable.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e depends on the Acts of Congre&s;s. (Mr. <HI>Higgin&s;on</HI> then read the Act of Congre&s;s of the 4th Augu&s;t 1790, &s;ection 13th and the provi&s;o.)</P>
<P>By this &s;ection and provi&s;o two things are requi&s;ite.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That they &s;hould be i&s;&s;ued before the fir&s;t of Ja|nuary 1790.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. That they &s;hould be i&s;&s;ued for SERVICES or SUPPLIES.</P>
<P>With regard to the fir&s;t of the&s;e qualities, it is evi|dent they were i&s;&s;ued by <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> before the 1&s;t Ja|nuary 1790. And it is equally evident as to the &s;econd. The gentleman who preceded me did not go on to &s;ay, that the New-Loan holders had no other debtor to look to but the &s;tate of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI> They were i&s;&s;ued for Continental certificates, &s;trange! He did not recognize this particular! Strange that a transfer of the debt &s;hould alter the con&s;ideration! The transfer was made
<PB N="371" REF="027132_0379_0FD3511FE29BBDC0">
for a valuable con&s;ideration.&mdash;The law which they &s;ay abrogated them was pa&s;&s;ed before the 4th day of Augu&s;t 1790. The <HI>North-Carolina</HI> certificates excepted, being i&s;&s;ued in 1786 corruptly, for no valuable con&s;ideration, is a &s;trong argument in our favour; Congre&s;s prohibited the a&s;&s;umption of the&s;e <HI>North-Carolina</HI> certificates, and enacted that they &s;hould not receive the benefit of this Act, becau&s;e they were i&s;&s;ued without any valuable con&s;i|deration; this exception makes the rule more &s;trong; and the New-Loans are much more included in that general provi&s;ion, being i&s;&s;ued by government, and having the recognition of public authority, being exchanged for Continental certificates which i&s;&s;ued for a <HI>bona fide</HI> con|&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Two objections may be rai&s;ed again&s;t this argument. 1. That the certificates of <HI>North-Carolina</HI> were in their original form i&s;&s;ued without that exception, and that New-Loan certificates exchanged for Continental ones were not recognized by the general government, nor by their officers, and that they could not be &s;pecifically included in the 13th &s;ection: But are they not ex|pre&s;sly mentioned in the 18th &s;ection?</P>
<P N="2">2d. By concluding from the generality of the rule, that New-Loans could not be included: But as Mr. <HI>Gallatin,</HI> a man of much ingenuity, in the ca&s;e of his conte&s;ted election, quoting the words of the 4th article of the confederation, "paupers, vagabonds and fugitives from ju&s;tice, excepted," argued that the&s;e were includ|ed, if the article had been penned without the&s;e words. The arguments are &s;tronger here than if they had all &s;tood without the exception. But Congre&s;s to place it out of all doubt and controver&s;y, enacted a clau&s;e to except the certificates of <HI>North-Carolina</HI> from being re|ceived on the loan. There are no rea&s;ons which could apply, but would have applied to the nece&s;&s;ity of the New-Loans being expre&s;sly excepted from the loan of the Union, if they had &s;o de&s;igned.</P>
<P>At all events the exception whether &s;ound or un|founded will be perfectly immaterial, when we con&s;ider
<PB N="372" REF="027132_0380_0FD3517C426A7050">
our law of the 27th March 1789, which pa&s;&s;ed after the adoption of the Federal Con&s;titution, if it meant to ex|clude them from provi&s;ion, why not make a literal ex|ception to them?</P>
<P>Before I come to con&s;ider the Act which erects New-Loans into &s;tate debts, permit me to ob&s;erve, that the Act which authori&s;es the payment of a demand is in fact an appropriation by law previous to the grant of the warrant, and is con&s;titutionally payable out of monies not otherwi&s;e &s;pecifically and previou&s;ly appropriated.</P>
<P>One rea&s;on is, it would always promote the good faith and intere&s;t of the &s;tate, and it would never com|mit it.</P>
<P>The money was to have been drawn from the Trea|&s;ury by the warrant of the Governor; if the certificate was in the u&s;ual form, if it was &s;uch as the officers would and ought to have made, believing it to be ju&s;t and right, the officer is not to an&s;wer, if there was any thing untrue in the certificate, it mu&s;t be &s;hewn; if any marks of delu&s;ion, it mu&s;t be pointed out. The Trea&s;urer paid the draft, if there had not been an appropriated fund the Governor ought not draw&mdash;the Trea&s;urer ought not to pay.</P>
<P>The &s;um was certified by the Comptroller-General, the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ed through the office of the Regi&s;ter-Ge|neral before it was handed to the Governor.</P>
<P>If the certificates are not redeemable by the Act of the 10th April 1792, the charge is right, if they are redeemable the charge is not true; if not literally true, the charge mu&s;t fall to the ground: Nay, &s;omething more is nece&s;&s;ary to make it criminal, than to &s;ay true, or untrue.</P>
<P>One criminal point is <HI>an omi&s;&s;ion,</HI> but it mu&s;t be &s;hewn; that it was the officer's duty to di&s;criminate, and it is their bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;hew that it was his po&s;itive duty to make it known to the other officers.</P>
<P>But if the officer did what he thought right, he is indi&s;putably innocent.</P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="027132_0381_0FD35121E6BE07A0">Much has been &s;aid about the liberality and ju&s;tice of the Legi&s;lature, re&s;pecting the Act of 1786, yet the mea&s;ure grew out of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, and the inter|e&s;t of government.</P>
<P>The State at this time had to choo&s;e the lea&s;t of two evils. <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> was punctual in paying her quota, other States were deficient; Congre&s;s was obliged then to i&s;&s;ue indents for intere&s;t which depreciated, per&s;ons from other States might buy up the&s;e indents to the lo&s;s of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> and the advantage of the delinquent States, and yet the payment thro' the State Loan-office was di&s;agreeable to Congre&s;s. The State of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> was therefore under the nece&s;&s;ity of pa&s;&s;ing the law of 1786 in order to &s;hun the wor&s;t of two evils. Her quota was a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and &s;he paid it. The motives were in order to confine her own payment to her own citizens, and the money to circulate in her own territory.</P>
<P>Thus it was agreed on all hands in the Legi&s;lature at that time, that <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> &s;hould a&s;&s;ume the debt to her own citizens, the only difference con&s;i&s;ted in the mode: This is fully proven by referring to the plan of finance then brought forward in oppo&s;ition to that which was adopted, both equally &s;upport our argument.</P>
<P>(Mr. <HI>Higgin&s;on</HI> read the following parts of the plans of Finance, &s;ee Minutes of A&s;&s;embly, 22d December, 1785, pages 117, 124, and 126.)</P>
<P N="13">"XIII. Thus the foregoing balances due to the United States may readily be di&s;charged. But there is &s;omething more that claims the attention of <HI>Penn&s;yl|vania.</HI></P>
<P>"According to the e&s;timation of Congre&s;s, the &s;um of 4,834,279 16/90 dollars, will be nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;charge the intere&s;t on the dome&s;tic debt of the United States till the end of the year 1784; and by the re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s of the 27th of September, 1785, facilities or intere&s;t certificates are directed to be i&s;&s;ued for the in|tere&s;t due until the 1&s;t of January, 1785, con&s;equently facilities will be i&s;&s;ued nearly to the amount afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>"Although this &s;tate hath di&s;charged the intere&s;t of
<PB N="374" REF="027132_0382_0FD3512546540690">
the debts of the United States, nearly to the amount of the quota of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> in the &s;um requi&s;ite to di&s;|charge the intere&s;t of the whole dome&s;tic debt to the &s;aid period; and, although this &s;tate hath by the Land-Office redeemed above &pound;. 220,000 of the principal of the dome&s;tic debt due by the United States to the citi|zens of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and yet continues to redeem the &s;ame by the means afore&s;aid; neverthele&s;s there remains a large portion of the whole of &s;aid debt yet due to the citizens of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and there are large arrears of intere&s;t yet unpaid upon the principal &s;ums &s;o due to them&mdash;This demon&s;trates the delinquency of &s;ome of the other &s;tates; a delinquency which ought not to be permitted, for (unle&s;s mea&s;ures be taken to prevent it) they would even profit by &s;uch delinquency, and the creditors of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> &s;uffer on account of their faith|ful and &s;trenuous exertions. The great quantity of facilities which would be paid to the citizens of <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania</HI> would cau&s;e them to depreciate, notwith&s;tand|ing the provi&s;ion made by Congre&s;s to prevent it; &s;o that the creditors in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> would not have the value intended them, and to which they are ju&s;tly en|titled&mdash;And this depreciation would enable citizens of other &s;tates to procure them in this &s;tate at a di&s;count, and &s;o to pay off their proportion of the Continental requi&s;itions with certificates obtained at le&s;s than &s;pecie value. For remedy whereof it is propo&s;ed,</P>
<P>"That the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of all certificates of debts due by the United States to citizens of this &s;tate, the intere&s;t of which were made payable at the continental loan-of|fice by the Act of March 16th, 1785, &s;hall have it at their option to receive from the Comptroller-General of the &s;tate, a certificate for a like &s;um in lieu thereof, bearing intere&s;t from the &s;ame date; and that the faith of the &s;tate be pledged for the redemption of all &s;uch certificates &s;o i&s;&s;ued.</P>
<P>"And that &s;uch Loan-Office certificates, entitled as afore&s;aid, as have been granted for continental money, &s;hall be &s;ettled and liquidated in &s;pecie by the &s;aid
<PB N="375" REF="027132_0383_0FD35165BAF0DA18">
Comptroller-General, agreeably to the &s;cale provided for that purpo&s;e by Act of Congre&s;s of the 28th of June, 1780.</P>
<P>"And whereas, according to the &s;aid Act of Con|gre&s;s, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of certificates for money loaned before the 1&s;t day of March, 1778, are entitled to an intere&s;t of 6 per cent. per annum in &s;pecie upon the nominal &s;um expre&s;&s;ed in the certificates, until the final redemption of the principal; that the &s;aid Comptroller-General &s;hall al&s;o certify &s;aid nominal &s;um on the back of every certificate i&s;&s;ued by him for Loan-office certi|ficates of the afore&s;aid de&s;cription; to the end that the &s;aid po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors may receive the &s;ame ju&s;tice from this &s;tate as hath been promi&s;ed them by the United States."</P>
<P><HI>The other plan contains as follows.</HI></P>
<P N="3">"III. As the demands under the 11th and 12th arti|cles have not been duly liquidated, the preci&s;e amount cannot be a&s;certained: But it is conceived that the ex|ce&s;s abovementioned, together with the &s;ales of lands, formerly pledged for the redemption of depreciation certificates, and the arrearages of militia fines, &s;uppo&s;ed to be about &pound;.31,500 would be more than &s;ufficient to pay them; and that probably the&s;e &s;ources would afford the means of &s;atisfying claimants as fa&s;t as their claims could be adju&s;ted. The balance &s;hould be carried to the aggregate fund.</P>
<P N="4">"IV. In order to provide for the &s;um contained in the 13th and 14th articles, it is propo&s;ed that a &s;ub|&s;cription be opened at the Bank for a loan of &pound;.2,000,000 to the State, the &s;ub&s;cription to be kept open till the fir&s;t day of April next. The &s;ub&s;cribers to pay one-fourth of the &s;ub&s;cription down, one-fourth on the fir&s;t Monday in April, one-fourth on the fir&s;t Monday in July, and the remainder on the fir&s;t Monday in October. The payments to be in Loan-office certificates, or other certificates of debts due by the United States to citi|zens of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> on which the intere&s;t is by law now payable in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> or in &s;uch depreciation
<PB N="376" REF="027132_0384_0FD35168610A8AB8">
certificates as are now entitled to receive intere&s;t from the exci&s;e, or in &s;pecie. The intere&s;t to be payable from the fir&s;t day of April, at the Bank, half-yearly. The fir&s;t half year's intere&s;t to be paid on the fir&s;t Monday in October, the &s;econd on the fir&s;t Monday in April, 1787, and &s;o on, until the final payment of the prin|cipal. The late proprietors to be entitled to the above|mentioned &s;um of &pound;.225,000 of the loan, or to adhere to their rights under the Act of November 1779, at their option.</P>
<P>"The provi&s;ion propo&s;ed for payment of the intere&s;t, and eventual payment of the principal, is as follows:</P>
<P N="1">"I. A tax on imports.</P>
<P>"Under this head it is to be ob&s;erved, that as the pre&s;ent plan is calculated to forward and not ob&s;truct the views of the United States, the duties propo&s;ed will be the lowe&s;t &s;tated in their recommendation. And when their &s;y&s;tem &s;hall be generally adopted, the duties now propo&s;ed may be relinqui&s;hed, and an equivalent &s;um be paid to the Bank from the duties rai&s;ed for payment of intere&s;t on the debt of the United States; and of which a con&s;iderable part will be payable to the State, in con&s;equence of their receiving continental cer|tificates for a loan made by the State."</P>
<P><HI>"Note,</HI> It is not improbable that the funds will be in&s;ufficient for the purpo&s;es to which they are appro|priated. The di&s;turbances at <HI>Wyoming</HI> may perhaps call for a con&s;iderable &s;um, which is not comprehended in the e&s;timate.</P>
<P N="4">"VI. The amount due on the requi&s;itions of Con|gre&s;s is (according to the 16th article) &pound;.91,915:17:6 which is payable by their Act on the 1&s;t day of May next. From this &s;um mu&s;t be taken, 1&s;t. The intere&s;t which will at that time be due to <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> from the United States on Continental certificates received at the Land-office and in taxes. 2d. The monies paid and payable before the fir&s;t of May to pen&s;ioners di&s;a|bled in the &s;ervice. The&s;e two articles will probably
<PB N="377" REF="027132_0385_0FD351C68A4F1D48">
amount to about &pound;.52,000 and will of cour&s;e reduce the balance to about &pound;.40,000.</P>
<P>"But as it is propo&s;ed to receive on the abovemen|tioned loan to the State, Continental certificates to the amount both of the principal and the intere&s;t which may be due on them, the intere&s;t will form a con&s;iderable part of the &s;um. The total is e&s;timated at &pound;.1,775,000 and therefore that part which con&s;i&s;ts of intere&s;t mu&s;t greatly exceed the above balance of &pound;.40,000.</P>
<P><HI>"Note,</HI> The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of Loan-office certificates bearing date before the 1&s;t day of March, 1778, are entitled (by re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s) to receive 6 per cent. on the &s;um &s;pecified in their certificates, altho' their real value (by the Continental &s;cale of deprecia|tion) is con&s;iderably le&s;s than the nominal &s;um. Hence it follows that the calculation (in the 13th article) of a principal &s;um due, which is made according to the amount of intere&s;t actually paid by the Loan-officer, is erroneous. But &s;ince the intere&s;t due on Continental certificates will (as ju&s;t mentioned) be an addition to the principal, it is probable that the exce&s;s of one will balance the deficiency of the other.</P>
<P>"By receiving in the propo&s;ed loan (at their real value) tho&s;e certificates which bear an intere&s;t of 6 per cent. on more than their real value the State will gain the difference between the intere&s;t on &s;uch real value, and the intere&s;t now payable by the United States, and the pre&s;ent holders of the certificates will have no rea|&s;on to complain, becau&s;e they may (at their option) either lend them to the State on the terms held out, or have recour&s;e to the United States on the terms of their re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>"On the future requi&s;itions of Congre&s;s, whenever they can be proportioned (either by the rule laid down in the articles of confederation, or by the rule lately recommended to the States) it will be expedient to rai&s;e an account of quotas with the United States, pa&s;&s;ing to their credit the total &s;um payable by <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and to their debit the total &s;um which <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> has
<PB N="378" REF="027132_0386_0FD351C9ED15AFE0">
paid. The balance of this account (being the exce&s;s or deficiency of payments) will be carried forward, &s;o as eventually to be liquidated in the annual demands of Congre&s;s, and annual payments of the State. Since therefore a con&s;iderable &s;um will (in the event) be pay|able to the United States every year (however the ba|lance may now &s;tand) it will be expedient to continue the pre&s;ent annual tax on property, and carry the pro|ceeds to the aggregate fund, which will receive.&mdash;"</P>
<P>It is true this la&s;t provi&s;ion was not carried into effect, owing altogether to circum&s;tances and motives of &s;tate policy.</P>
<P>It may then be &s;aid, that it is contended the law of March 1786 was temporary. True, this idea is in the preamble of the Act of 1789, but it is not pre&s;umed that it can be con&s;trued by the <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> explanation of the &s;ame Act, neither intended nor mentioned, nor does the Act contain a &s;ingle idea of a temporary provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>Read this Act according to the minutes already read, it will be ea&s;ily &s;een that the New-Loans are an exi&s;ting &s;tate debt. Read it you will &s;ee a better rule of con|&s;truction than by &s;peeches, re&s;olutions or reports of committees. (The 1&s;t and 2d &s;ections were then read.) Now, Sir, let the fir&s;t and &s;econd &s;ections of this law be taken in any point of view, I contend the New-Loans are not de&s;troyed as a debt, but at mo&s;t only a &s;u&s;pen|&s;ion of payment, and a provi&s;ion for completing the payment of intere&s;t for four years.</P>
<P>Or, a modification as to payment: To tho&s;e who did not chu&s;e to embrace the invitation, there is an offer, in the &s;econd &s;ection. It was only as a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, and to tho&s;e who did not chu&s;e to embrace it, it was only a modification of payment.</P>
<P>Then follows the provi&s;ion of the option held out to New-Loan holders; thus the Act operates either as a &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion, or a modification; in this, two points are to be con&s;idered, enough of the Act of March 1786 is left to con&s;titute a debt.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="379" REF="027132_0387_0FD3517F47820AF8">2. Repealing a law is not repealing what was done under it.</P>
<P>Of the Act of March 1786 enough is unrepealed to make the certificates neither null nor void.</P>
<P>For 1. In the 8th &s;ection the intere&s;t is directed to be paid: 2. In the 11th &s;ection they are made receivable in the Land-Office.</P>
<P>Both are only mere forms of words, for the Legi&s;lature could not make them null and void if they intended &s;o to do; to do that, and to exclude them from the loan they mu&s;t be rejected by the Legi&s;lature of the Union as the certificates of <HI>North-Carolina</HI> heretofore adverted to.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion may be reduced to this &s;imple po&s;ition, that as the gentleman ye&s;terday &s;aid re&s;pecting the ex|i&s;tence of a legi&s;lative power in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> a po&s;ition indi&s;putable; &s;o likewi&s;e in this in&s;tance, the funda|mental principles of Nature, may as well be &s;et bounds to as to the principles of natural ju&s;tice; in either ca&s;e to become a legi&s;lative act, it might have the form of a law, but not the force of one: There are moral im|po&s;&s;ibilities as well as natural ones, and the&s;e exi&s;t with Legi&s;latures.</P>
<P>A Legi&s;lature therefore can no more effectually anni|hilate any rights, or enact away its own obligations, than it can enact that a body &s;hall decrea&s;e in gravita|tion in proportion as it de&s;cends to the earth.</P>
<P>Thus much I have &s;aid to enforce that rule of con|&s;truction that if a law can receive any po&s;&s;ible con&s;truc|tion, that will avoid &s;o &s;erious an imputation as the vi|olation of public faith, and will comport with ju&s;tice, &s;uch con&s;truction we are bound to put upon it. What a government cannot of right do, we &s;urely &s;hould not pre&s;ume it meant to do; unle&s;s the Act was planned for &s;uch, unequivocal in its meaning, and un&s;u&s;ceptible of any other con&s;truction.</P>
<P>In the third &s;ection the words <HI>many</HI> and <HI>&s;o much</HI> are relative terms, and imply that &s;ome would not be wil|ling to exchange or to take back the Continental cer|tificates.</P>
<P><PB N="380" REF="027132_0388_0FD3516A3B8D6C20">I ob&s;erve that the framers of that Act, in order en|tirely to deprive the holders of the benefit of an obliga|tion &s;olemnly i&s;&s;ued by the &s;tate, would have u&s;ed other words, would have gone further than barely to give the holders a permi&s;&s;ion to exchange if they &s;aw fit; in con|templating the ca&s;e of holders who might not chu&s;e to exchange, they would have gone on, and declared ex|plicitly the con&s;equences of not exchanging.</P>
<P>But, Sir, do the operative words of the repealing clau&s;e de&s;troy the debt of which the New-Loans are the evidence. In order to de&s;troy them, the certificates them&s;elves &s;hould be declared null and void; becau&s;e the payment of the intere&s;t or principal expre&s;&s;ed on the face of them cea&s;es to be &s;ecured by any law: does the debt of which they are the evidence cea&s;e to exi&s;t? Can the exi&s;tence of a debt depend on the exi&s;tence of a provi&s;ion for the payment of it's intere&s;t or principal? May there not be a debt without any exi&s;ting appropri|ation for the payment of the principal or intere&s;t? Surely there may.</P>
<P>How then can it be &s;aid that by repealing all laws &s;pecifically &s;ecuring the payment of the principal or in|tere&s;t, the debt it&s;elf is annihilated?</P>
<P>No, Sir, both the Preamble and the Act clearly &s;how, it was only meant the exchange &s;hould be optional, and tho&s;e who did not chu&s;e to exchange &s;hould retain their certificates valid on their original grounds, though without any particular appropriation for the payment of the principal or intere&s;t: This is the ca&s;e under the Continental loan, and tho&s;e who did not choo&s;e to ac|cept the terms of that loan and &s;ub&s;cribe to it, &s;till hold and were meant to hold their evidences of debt as valid as at the fir&s;t moment of their exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>The preamble to this Act &s;tates that the funds which were intended for the payment of this debt were likely under the new government to be transferred to the Trea&s;ury of the Union.</P>
<P>It was for this rea&s;on that the laws which &s;pecifically &s;ecured the payment of intere&s;t or principal the New-Loans
<PB N="381" REF="027132_0389_0FD35127F5626990">
was repealed, leaving the debt it&s;elf, of which they were the evidences, &s;ound and entire. Says the &s;tate, I do not mean to de&s;troy my obligation, I cannot do it, but my funds are gone, and I mu&s;t &s;u&s;pend the payment, take your chance of my future competency, eventual &s;olvency, and ultimate payment, or I will give you another choice, you may if you had rather re-exchange my obligation for tho&s;e of the continent, then take back your Continental certificate, and give back my New-Loan.</P>
<P>Therefore, Sir, in&s;tead of charging the Comptroller-General with having tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the law in violation of his duty and to the prejudice of the &s;tate, rather let it be &s;aid, that he magnified the law and made it honorable.</P>
<P>If the provi&s;ion in the third &s;ection re&s;pecting the Land-Office be regarded, it will be recognized, that by the &s;econd &s;ection an obligation is impo&s;ed not upon the holder but upon the &s;tate, pay the New-Loans on ap|plication with a like &s;um in Continental certificates, let it be remembered that this idea of exchange is altoge|ther out of the que&s;tion, as it does not come after the repealing clau&s;e, the obligation, I &s;ay, is altogether on the &s;tate.</P>
<P>I a&s;k then when the obligation of this tran&s;action is not equally obligatory on both &s;ides, and when the &s;tate is either to pay or take up the New-Loans on the appli|cation of the holders, by delivery of its own property of a particular kind, but equal value, what is the rea&s;on, or meaning of it?</P>
<P>Does it not imply nece&s;&s;arily a right in the holder to demand, and an obligation on the &s;tate to pay or de|liver?</P>
<P>Does it acknowledge the debt or not? Are not the Continental certificates &s;trictly the property of the &s;tate? When they are obliged to part from them, does &s;he not part from a thing of value?</P>
<P>If the &s;tate lies under this obligation, the New-Loans are a debt due from her, &s;trictly and properly &s;peaking, though they are redeemable only in a particular mode.</P>
<P><PB N="382" REF="027132_0390_0FD3512B541F2F20">What are the Continental certificates? They are not money to be &s;ure!</P>
<P>But they are a commodity, or thing of value: The exi&s;tence of the debt does not depend on the &s;pecies of payment: Whether my &s;atisfaction of a demand, my di&s;lodging an incumbent obligation on me, is done by the delivery of money or any other obligation, it is a debt &s;till.</P>
<P>Let me a&s;k, whether any &s;ub&s;criber of &s;tate debt be|lieves that Congre&s;s if their funds were to fail for the di&s;charge of intere&s;t, could compel them to take back &s;tate certificates again. AH PUNIC FAITH!</P>
<P>This would have been a mere tender law, and con|&s;equently void; and a nullity.</P>
<P>The continent had a&s;&s;umed &s;tate debts; the entries were made on the books of the Trea&s;ury. In other words, will the United States perform their engagements if the U|nited States &s;hould &s;ay, take back your &s;tate certificates. Such a law would be unju&s;t, and not binding; any &s;ub|traction of the debt would be di&s;honorable to the Uni|on; it would rip up credit from it's &s;ource&mdash;Oh! &s;uch an idea is prepo&s;terous. What then is the meaning? Then &s;ure, it does recognize the debt. Are not the Con|tinental certificates &s;trictly the property of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e for in&s;tance, that Congre&s;s had enacted that propo&s;ition into the funding &s;y&s;tem, which was propo&s;|ed by the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury in his report on public credit, that two thirds of the debt &s;hould be funded at an annuity of &s;ix per cent. redeemable at plea|&s;ure, and the other third be paid in lands in the We&s;t|ern Territory, at twenty cents per acre. Would this have been a de&s;troying of one third of the debt? No; it could only have been in this ca&s;e a modification of the payment. Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> in his te&s;timony (page 296) declared that it was immaterial to redeem that way or by the Land-Office, the price being then nearly equal; the Land-Office was &s;hut again&s;t the New-Loans by the Act of March 1789, but another door is thrown open, an|other fund is &s;ub&s;tituted for the holders of the New-Loans,
<PB N="383" REF="027132_0391_0FD3516D1141F030">
in point of principle the &s;ame. The &s;tate &s;ays, we cannot go no further, the holder does not get quite &s;o much; Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> tells you, whil&s;t the Land-of|fice was open, a fund was provided; then the Land-of|fice being open recognizes the debt; &s;hut the Land-of|fice, the lo&s;s is certain. Here is a recognition of the debt; this is a matter of di&s;grace to <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> fir&s;t make an advantage of a bargain, then depreciate, and la&s;tly buy in at a di&s;count.</P>
<P>Who is our accu&s;er? The State of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI> I demand that the &s;tate of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> will come with clean hands her&s;elf; we are ready to receive the &s;troke of ju&s;tice; there is no force in the objection; it is of no con&s;equence to &s;ay that Congre&s;s would eventually pay the money on the Continental certificates; the means of reducing that to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion are certainly ju&s;t as valuable as the benefits tho&s;e means can procure, and the parting with the means is parting with the end, and therefore with the value.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e, I pay my debt to my creditor with the bond of my debtor, it makes no difference.</P>
<P>To explain further. If the New-Loans are admitted as debts of any kind; if they inve&s;t the holder with a right, and impo&s;e an obligation on the &s;tate, as in the words of the Act; if tho&s;e holders are creditors at all of the &s;tate, then they are within the &s;ixth clau&s;e of the redeeming Act of the 10th of April 1792. (Mr. <HI>Hig|gin&s;on</HI> was interrupted by Mr. <HI>Inger&s;oll,</HI> who &s;aid, <HI>"It is not admitted.")</HI></P>
<P>If the holders are creditors this will not be denied. Are the holders of the New-Loans creditors of any body? If they are creditors then, and the New-Loans are the evidence of that credit, to whom are they cre|ditors? Of the Union? No. Are they creditors of the State? No; &s;ay they! that character is de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice and &s;implicity delight in each other; they are the creditors of the &s;tate, or more literally &s;peaking, they put their tru&s;t in the &s;tate, and the &s;tate on the other hand, in this Act, acknowledges that &s;he has
<PB N="384" REF="027132_0392_0FD3513C79F19E40">
&s;omething in tru&s;t for them; which &s;he obligates her&s;elf in this very Act to pay or deliver.</P>
<P>But, it is &s;aid, that this Act had received a &s;ilent con|&s;truction from the &s;tatements of this, and other officers, &s;peeches of the Governor, wherein the claims again&s;t the &s;tate are enumerated, in which the New-Loans were omitted, reports of committees on ways and means, in which the actual demands again&s;t the commonwealth are &s;et forth, in many places they are called New-Loan debts: The&s;e were likewi&s;e omitted, all being after the pa&s;&s;ing of the Act of March 1789, make a &s;trong argument, as &s;hewing the uniform con&s;truction in all their proce|dures.</P>
<P>It is not &s;afe to infer &s;trongly from mere omi&s;&s;ions, this is a negative circum&s;tance, to infer from the omi&s;|&s;ion more &s;hould be &s;hewn than the omi&s;&s;ion; that there &s;hould have been a propriety or duty in ab&s;olutely in|&s;erting them.</P>
<P>The Executive who&s;e part it is to addre&s;s the Legi&s;la|ture on the opening of each &s;e&s;&s;ions; to communicate to them the tran&s;actions of his department, in the ex|ecution of pre-exi&s;ting laws, to point out the objects which &s;eem particularly to claim legi&s;lative attention, and above all, to &s;tate the &s;ituation of the Trea&s;ury, the amount of exi&s;ting and payable obligations, for which provi&s;ions mu&s;t be made by actual appropriations.</P>
<P>Finds it nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;ort to tho&s;e officers with whom the documents giving this information are lodged: The&s;e officers make reports with an eye to this object; the Governor takes this report for his guide to that ob|ject in his &s;peech, or other communications.</P>
<P>And then the committees on ways and means, in the Hou&s;e, who&s;e very name and &s;tile point out their duty, and their &s;phere, reported upon the &s;ame &s;ubject; in neither &s;tatements, &s;peeches or reports were the New-Loans included after the pa&s;&s;ing the Act of March 1789. And why not?</P>
<P>Becau&s;e there was no propriety in including them, be|cau&s;e they were unfunded, and therefore irrelevant to
<PB N="385" REF="027132_0393_0FD3513ED7327DE8">
the &s;ubject of Ways and Means: (Becau&s;e the arrears of intere&s;t excepted which were expre&s;sly &s;tated) there was not ari&s;ing out of them any demand which the Legi&s;lature had made actually payable, and for which an appropriation with Ways and Means would be ne|ce&s;&s;ary. It was on this ground the unfunded deprecia|tion was not included in them. To draw any inference from this omi&s;&s;ion would de&s;troy the di&s;tinction between funded and unfunded depreciation debt. If an appro|priation had been nece&s;&s;ary, it would be a &s;ubject for the con&s;ideration of the committees on Ways and Means. It is one thing for the Legi&s;lature to re&s;olve to pay a demand, and another, and a &s;ub&s;equent one to provide Ways and Means, 'till the former is done, the latter is nugatory and unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Again, Sir, it is true, that in the la&s;t report read, which is the only in&s;tance of the kind, there is a &s;tate|ment of all the debts of the commonwealth, and al&s;o the &s;ources of revenue, in which the unfunded depre|ciation is included, and the New-Loans are not includ|ed, but this will be accounted for, when we con&s;ider; that the Land-office was open to the unfunded depre|ciation certificates, whil&s;t it was &s;hut again&s;t the <HI>New-Loans:</HI> for which there exi&s;ted the provi&s;ion by ex|change in the Act of March 1789, the State was re|deeming her New-Loans with tho&s;e who choo&s;e to make the application without dimini&s;hing her own active ca|pital, while the holders of the Continental certificates exchanged, &s;uffered a diminution on the nominal value, contemplated in the funding law of Congre&s;s; but as long as the State kept her Land-office open to the un|funded depreciation certificates &s;he was actually paying off the unfunded depreciation out of her own capital.</P>
<P>But the&s;e topics may certainly be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, for if the committee had expre&s;&s;ed their opinion directly again&s;t the New-Loans as a debt, it would be neither more nor le&s;s than the la&s;t committee did, who originated this impeachment, and could have no more influence
<PB N="386" REF="027132_0394_0FD327F00DC99250">
or weight, except their opinions had been bottomed on a more &s;olid foundation.</P>
<P>But, again, it is contended from another quarter that this &s;ubject hath received a con&s;truction, and been ex|pre&s;sly decided upon by the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury again&s;t their &s;ub&s;cribability. Permit me to turn for a moment to that corre&s;pondence, the fir&s;t letter which is connected with this &s;uppo&s;ed deci&s;ion is the letter of Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> of January 14, 1793, (page 74-5-6) and its an&s;wer, (page 76-7-8) by which it is attempted to be proven that he has decided on their non-&s;ub&s;criba|bility.</P>
<P>(After the two letters were read, Mr. <HI>Higgin&s;on</HI> ob|&s;erved.)</P>
<P>I will not undertake to &s;ay how far it was proper for an individual member of the committee to anticipate the Act of the whole, and as it were fore&s;tall informa|tion on the &s;ubject; however, it may be remembered, that at this time, the impeachment was &s;lowly growing under the fo&s;tering kind culture of the writer's, <HI>(Galla|tin)</HI> hands.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t circum&s;tance that &s;trikes me in reading <HI>this letter</HI> and <HI>the an&s;wer,</HI> is, that the two la&s;t que&s;tions were left unan&s;wered by the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury; to the la&s;t he replies nothing, and on the matter of the &s;e|cond he ob&s;erved hypothetically, that if the New-Loans are not a debt they are not a&s;&s;umable; from this cir|cum&s;tance I infer, con&s;idering that gentleman's charact|er, (I mean the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury) that tho&s;e que&s;tions were in his opinion improper; at all events it is certain that the an&s;wer to it was not what was wi&s;hed for, otherwi&s;e the &s;ub&s;equent letter of the Governor, which I &s;hall pre&s;ently read, would have been unnece&s;|&s;ary, the object of enquiry being preci&s;ely the &s;ame. This letter of Mr. <HI>Gallatin's,</HI> contains a &s;ingular cour&s;e of rea&s;oning, and deductions from premi&s;es, which the writer knew at the time to be unfounded. The Secre|tary &s;tates forty thou&s;and pounds, as out&s;tanding; he (Mr. <HI>Gallatin)</HI> then goes on to ob&s;erve, "But as &s;ome
<PB N="387" REF="027132_0395_0FD351CB855F5208">
have been offered," &amp;c. (page 75.) Sir, he had it not more in proof that &s;ome of them were not &s;o exchanged after they were offered than before. From the documents of the Comptroller-General a report had in the fir&s;t in|&s;tance been made to the Governor, and tran&s;mitted to the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury; the writer's animadver&s;ions therefore on that ground impliedly criminates that of|ficer.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erved al&s;o, that "I &s;hould be led to think," &amp;c. The grounds of the Secretary's opinion did not imply any &s;uch declaration; but even if the premi&s;es had been true, the conclu&s;ion would not follow: This would indeed be a fiction with a witne&s;s to it.</P>
<P>Here I will take it with Mr. <HI>Gallatin,</HI> that the rea&s;on why the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury did not require the &s;urrender or &s;u&s;pend the intere&s;t, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been, becau&s;e, he looked upon all the New-Loans to be either redeemed or re-exchanged; now, if in order to account for the Secretary's not requiring a &s;urrender or &s;u&s;pending payment of intere&s;t, the inference is that he con&s;idered them a&s;&s;umable and redeemable; Does it follow that he &s;hould reject them as a&s;&s;umable? by no means. The contrary is the proper conclu&s;ion; it fol|lows immediately and directly that he &s;hould admit them as a&s;&s;umable, and it would al&s;o follow, that the demand could only be on the grounds that they were a&s;&s;umable, and al&s;o that a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion would follow unle&s;s the Con|tinental certificates were &s;urrendered, which the Secre|tary of the Trea&s;ury agreed might be done.</P>
<P>But the an&s;wer to this letter did not contain the idea which &s;eems to have been anticipated and expected by the writer; therefore we find the Governor writing to the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury on the &s;ame &s;ubject the 29th July 1793, (letter page 351-2 then read) and the Secretary's an&s;wer of Augu&s;t 21, 1793 (&s;ee page 218-9). This letter left the que&s;tion of the validity of the Act of March 1789, re&s;pecting the a&s;&s;umability of the New-Loan certificates untouched. The opinion of this officer on the &s;ub&s;cribability of the certificates is not expre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="388" REF="027132_0396_0FD352608A16D320">
in any part of this letter. "The&s;e circum&s;tances, &amp;c." this &s;entence contains an opinion, but that opinion is not on the principle that New-Loans are not a&s;&s;umable, is not, that the law of March 27th, 1789 de&s;troyed them as a debt, but it is that the foregoing enumerated cir|cum&s;tances ari&s;ing from the interference of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> have amounted to a virtual rejection of them in effect; which does not even implicate his opinion on the que&s;|tion of law.</P>
<P>Again, "I was about to conform, &amp;c."&mdash;This &s;urely does not imply his own opinion, and how far this officer, after having referred a que&s;tion of law to the Attorney-General of the United States, the fir&s;t profe&s;&s;ional officer of the government, and received his opinion, may think him&s;elf bound by it, I cannot undertake to determine.</P>
<P>It is probable however, when the que&s;tion was &s;ome|what doubtful and the opinion founded on public expe|diency, when this State appeared &s;o anxious to avoid any mi&s;under&s;tanding with the Trea&s;ury of the Union, that opinion might be con&s;idered obligatory as to the fact of admitting or rejecting them. We contend, how|ever, that the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury had not in this letter expre&s;&s;ed his opinion at all on the operation of the Act of March 1789, much le&s;s on the validity of it; if then, it is clear, that the Secretary of the Trea|&s;ury has in the cour&s;e of this tran&s;action expre&s;&s;ed his opinion unequivocally in favour of the New-Loans, and if in this letter he does not expre&s;s his opinion again&s;t them, there are &s;till odds in favour of the officer now on his defence: But I go further, Sir, and con|tend, that if this officer has at all expre&s;&s;ed his opinion on the principle of this que&s;tion even after the di&s;clo|&s;ure of the Act of March 1789, it is in favour of the New-Loans and not again&s;t them.</P>
<P>This will appear from &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in his letter in an&s;wer to Mr. <HI>Gallatin's</HI> letter; when the Act of March 1789 had been brought into his view, for he expre&s;sly adverts to that objection.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="027132_0397_0FD32802D2864F40">Before I read tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, &s;uffer me to make a comment on the fir&s;t part of a former letter (&s;ee page 76, &amp;c.) from this officer. It may &s;erve to &s;hew that the extreme &s;olicitude di&s;covered by the State with regard to this que&s;tion might have betrayed the Secre|tary of the Trea&s;ury into a want of accuracy, a mi&s;take which can be very &s;eldom imputed to him.</P>
<P>The paragraph to which I allude is that (page 77) <HI>"that they &s;hould at the time of being &s;ub&s;cribed be recog|nized by the exi&s;ting laws of the States as evidences of debts by them re&s;pectively owing."</HI> With the mo&s;t re&s;|pectful deference to the writer of this letter, I conceive that this expre&s;&s;ion is not &s;ufficiently defined <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> accu|rate; for if any State had pa&s;&s;ed a law abrogating cer|tain certificates, which by the funding law were made &s;ub&s;cribable and redeemable, that law would not be permitted, or &s;uffered to take away that right or benefit thus given and guaranteed by a pre-exi&s;ting and par|amount law of the United States.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e, after the pa&s;&s;ing of the Act of the 4th of Augu&s;t 1790, the whole loan under the a&s;&s;umption, at that rate, might have been defeated, fru&s;trated, and ren|dered void.</P>
<P>In a &s;ucceeding paragraph, he ob&s;erved, "If how|ever the New-Loan certificates are not by the laws of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> con&s;idered as <HI>debts</HI> but merely as receipts for certificates of the United States," &amp;c. (&s;ee page 78.) It may be ob&s;erved that this is a mere hypothetical ex|pre&s;&s;ion, and as it comes in as a qualification to the other remark, that as the certificates were then pre&s;ented, no doubt could be entertained of their a&s;&s;umability, it clearly implies that if this condition fails, that is, if the New-Loans cannot be con&s;idered as mere <HI>receipts</HI> de|mandable at the plea&s;ure of the government, then no doubt could remain of their a&s;&s;umability al&s;o.</P>
<P>Now taking it for granted for a moment that the State could convert that into a mere receipt, which was origi|nally i&s;&s;ued as an obligation, yet &s;he has not done it; as there is nothing then which obliges the holder to part
<PB N="390" REF="027132_0398_0FD351FD454AC450">
with his New-Loan on the application of the State, it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible to con&s;ider the New-Loans as mere receipts, demandable at the plea&s;ure of the State; and their being &s;o, con&s;titutes the very object of the Secre|tary of the Trea&s;ury's &s;uppo&s;ition. As then this hypothe&s;is fails, as the New-Loans cannot be con&s;idered as mere re|ceipts demandable at plea&s;ure, what follows? Why, they revert back to their original ground, the propo&s;ition a&s;&s;umes its fir&s;t and original form, and in the opinion of the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, they are a&s;&s;umable:&mdash;This idea is held out in another of his letters, where he adverts to the Act of March 1789, but to &s;uppo&s;e that the holders of New-Loans are creditors, and their certificates no more than mere receipts, and con&s;equently no debts, this po&s;i|tion cannot be &s;upported without doing a violence to the letter of the law; but, on the other hand &s;uppo&s;e we &s;hall coincide with their con&s;truction of the Acts of the Legi&s;lature, and agree with the Attorney-General of the United States him&s;elf, who &s;ays, (page 81) that "the Act of March 1789, &amp;c. aboli&s;hed the&s;e certifi|cates as debts of the State, as wanting the due recog|nition from the State, and cannot be legally received upon loan." A moment's con&s;ideration will &s;hew that this was a contract: And when the Con&s;titution of the United States is brought into view, this in&s;trument &s;ays, that all debts and engagements &s;hall be as valid again&s;t the United States under this con&s;titution as under the confederation. But they &s;ay fir&s;t, this does not apply, and &s;econdly they &s;ay, the Con&s;titution refers only to contracts between individuals, and not between a State and her own citizens.</P>
<P>Now it is certain, loans are contracts, and if contracts are loans, and the Act of March 1789 pa&s;&s;ed after the adoption of the Federal Con&s;titution, then it is certain that the New-Loans are &s;ub&s;cribable and con&s;equently redeemable.</P>
<P>If it can extend to contracts between citizens of a State, <HI>a fortiori,</HI> it extends to contracts in which the State is a party.</P>
<P><PB N="391" REF="027132_0399_0FD328041FEFA0F0">So intimate is the connection; &s;o great is the influence which the conduct and character of the &s;everal States have upon that of the Union, that the framers of this in&s;trument mu&s;t have been blind to the general intere&s;t, if they had not introduced this provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>To tie up the hands of the Union, therefore, in that Con&s;titution would have been u&s;ele&s;s, without tying up al&s;o the hands of the States with re&s;pect to their con|tracts.</P>
<P>Will the United States tie up their own hands and not tie up the hands of the individual States? Thus guarding the two extremes and leave a vacuum in the middle unguarded!</P>
<P>What was the rea&s;on for in&s;erting it in the Con&s;titu|tion? To pre&s;erve public credit. Is there a more deli|cate &s;ubject in the world than public credit?</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the country at the time made &s;uch a provi&s;ion nece&s;&s;ary. The <HI>American</HI> name which from the independence had been &s;liding fa&s;t to ruin, had every thing to make her happy, but wanted one thing to make her re&s;pectable, that was CREDIT; the grand <HI>de&s;ideratum</HI> without which the re&s;t would be nugatory and unavail|ing.</P>
<P>Sir, if the limbs were pal&s;ied, what would it avail that the body was &s;ound, I will not in&s;i&s;t upon the proverb of the &s;heep, but this I will &s;ay, that where the children turn out badly, it is apt to hurt the reputation of the family: If a State had the power of impairing her own contracts and &s;acrificing her faith, then it would follow, that however well di&s;po&s;ed the general government might be, however &s;ound at the centre; yet all the States in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion might &s;acrifice their credit by impairing their contracts, and the Union robbed of her re&s;pectability, and her credit by the mi&s;management of her children left to parry the &s;trokes of fortune.</P>
<P>But another thing; this omi&s;&s;ion would not only have been the road by which the credit of the Union would de&s;ert it, but it would have been the &s;ource of confu|&s;ion and contention at home. If the Con&s;titution had
<PB N="392" REF="027132_0400_0FD351CD9C8911A8">
not expre&s;&s;ed this prohibition, civil wars might have been the monuments of its weakne&s;s. While in one State the obligation of contracts was held as &s;acred as it ought to be; in another they would be pro&s;trated to temporary convenience.</P>
<P>Taking this ca&s;e, then, to be literally within the words and e&s;&s;entially within the &s;pirit of this clau&s;e; let us &s;ee in what manner it has been violated.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t. Were the New-Loans a debt, or evidence of a debt due from the State of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> at any time before the pa&s;&s;ing of the Act of 27th March, 1789?</P>
<P>As to this, I take it to be undeniable that the New-Loans had been a debt of this State. This is not only acknowledged and implied by the tenor of the articles them&s;elves, but they are expre&s;sly called a debt of the State in the Act which created them; and al&s;o in the Act which impaired them.</P>
<P>Indeed, this is conceded on all hands, except by one, the Trea&s;urer of the State (&s;ee page 68) in his letter to the Speaker of the lower Hou&s;e; wherein he &s;tiles them <HI>"Which in fact never were a State debt."</HI></P>
<P>It may be ob&s;erved however, that if the law of March 1789 &s;hould be found not to abrogate or de&s;troy the debt, which I think will appear, yet if it in any way impairs the obligation of the contract, it is mo&s;t clearly and undeniably a violation of the Con&s;titution of the United States, and therefore void to all intents and purpo&s;es, and if &s;o, this tribunal is bound to con&s;ider it, as never having any exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Again, and for the la&s;t time, upon a &s;trict compari&s;on of the Acts of March 1786, and that of March 1789, it will be found that the New-Loan certificates were equally unimpaired after the Act, as they were before.</P>
<P>Let us &s;ee how much, in order to di&s;tingui&s;h between tho&s;e parts which created the debt it&s;elf, and tho&s;e which directed the payment of principal and intere&s;t: It may be con&s;idered the funds for payment of intere&s;t were temporary. (Mr. <HI>Higgin&s;on</HI> then read the minutes of 1789, page 145, by which it appeared that the provi|&s;ion
<PB N="393" REF="027132_0401_0FD35262B2B72780">
re&s;pecting the principal of the New-loans was in|troduced at the third reading of the bill. The original and primary object of the bill being, that the intere&s;t &s;hould cea&s;e, as the provi&s;ion for that purpo&s;e had been temporary.</P>
<P>In page 184, "it was moved by Mr. <HI>Fitz&s;imons,</HI> &s;e|conded by Mr. <HI>M'Pher&s;on,"</HI> &amp;c. The bill originated through the exigency of the State. Before the law pa&s;&s;ed, the Land-office was to have been &s;hut, in what manner was it to be produced? it was forbidden&mdash;Is not forbidding a <HI>payment</HI> in futuro, a te&s;timony of the exi&s;tence of the debt.</P>
<P>The payment of New-Loan certificates was prohi|bited in the Land-office. Now, what parts are tho&s;e of the Act of March 1786 which created the debt? Even the Act it&s;elf did not immediately create the debt; tho&s;e parts in the &s;econd &s;ection do not. The loan was to be opened, &s;uppo&s;e none chu&s;e to &s;ub&s;cribe to it im|mediately; then there would be no debt: By opening, &s;ub&s;cribing, and paying, the debt &s;prung into exi&s;tence, that moment it became a debt: and a certificate is given merely as an evidence of that debt. (The &s;econd &s;ection of the Act of March 1, 1786 was then read.)</P>
<P>There is nothing in this to &s;ecure the payment of either principal or intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Nothing in the &s;econd &s;ection directs or &s;ecures the payment of the debt, the kinds of certificates directed to be received on loan are not immediately under the fir&s;t and &s;econd &s;ections.</P>
<P>But the repealing clau&s;e of the Act of March 1789 has full force, &s;atisfaction and complete exi&s;tence out of the other clau&s;es of the Act of 1786. Ingenuity it|&s;elf with all her hundred eyes is not able to e&s;cape the inference which I draw from a &s;trict compari&s;on of the Acts of March 1789 and 1786.</P>
<P>Why then need we be drawn into the imputation of &s;o di&s;reputable a violation of public faith? How then, can it be charged, as hath been done by one gentle|man, that this officer by the <HI>magic wand</HI> of his office
<PB N="394" REF="027132_0402_0FD35210C6BFB8E0">
had conjured up the gho&s;ts of the departed New-Loans to frighten away the dollars of the commonwealth, without imputing to the State, who was their creator, the odious crime of unnatural murder?</P>
<P>Let us now con&s;ider how this hath been con&s;trued by the Legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>In an Act pa&s;&s;ed the 30th September 1791, for the relief of <HI>Sarah Caldwell</HI> and others, who had lo&s;t New-Loan certificates, the State undertook to &s;ub&s;cribe for their u&s;e, and to pay to them the intere&s;t on &s;uch &s;ub|&s;criptions, on their giving &s;ecurity to indemnify the State ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in&s;t the holders of her certificates.</P>
<P>This Act proves two things. Fir&s;t, that the New-Loan creditors of them&s;elves could do nothing, they had no claim on the Union, and therefore were not creditors of the Union. And &s;econdly, By requiring an indemnity from the holder, inevitably implies a right of demand on the State ve&s;ted in that holder, and that right of demand whatever it be, con&s;titutes the &s;trictne&s;s and propriety of character of CREDITOR.</P>
<P>In the in&s;tructions of the Supreme Executive Council (page 267) are the&s;e words, <HI>"You will i&s;&s;ue a new cer|tificate."</HI> Will it be contended that the&s;e are mere re|ceipts? can certificates of parts be debts, when the whole was no debt in its original form?</P>
<P>As the ca&s;e then is brought thus clearly within the &s;cope of the redemption law of the 10th of April 1792, what can be offered in oppo&s;ition to our conclu&s;ion?</P>
<P>One thing only, that as the New-Loans them&s;elves amounted to more than this State's proportion of the a&s;&s;umed debt, it could not be imputed to the Legi&s;la|ture, that they meant to include the New-Loans: it may be remarked, that as the inference drawn by Mr. <HI>Galla|tin</HI> from the con&s;equences of the rule laid down by him relative to the 4th article of the confederation, it only proved the law a bad one.</P>
<P>As this is introduced a pre&s;umptive argument is brought forward again&s;t it. They &s;ay, how injurious it is to the State, and of what bad con&s;equences to re|deem
<PB N="395" REF="027132_0403_0FD352663A9617B8">
her own debts at 20&shilling; in the pound! If they call this a bad con&s;equence, give it that con&s;truction, as a pre&s;umptive argument as it regards the State, the con|&s;equence is with us, and not with them.</P>
<P>Here is a &s;ingular circum&s;tance, they have violated the rules of law, they have con&s;trued the law of 1786 &s;trictly with regard to this object; and they have con|&s;trued the law of 1789, which confers benefits liberally in their own favour.</P>
<P>Again, another argument is brought forward.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid the &s;ixth &s;ection is a provi&s;o to the &s;econd &s;ection.</P>
<P>If &s;o, the object was tho&s;e which &s;he had before re|deemed in the &s;econd &s;ection to the benefit of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>If &s;o, the &s;ixth is co-exten&s;ive with the &s;econd as to objects. If the New-Loans by the &s;ixth &s;ection are re|deemable through the medium of the United States, it is &s;till better: If they are not redeemable, the mode is not commen&s;urate to the objects contemplated in the &s;econd &s;ection, and it is wrong to a&s;cribe that to the Le|gi&s;lature, which could not be her motive.</P>
<P>Bills of Credit are enumerated and provided for in the &s;econd &s;ection; the &s;ixth &s;ection is introduced to be be|neficial, and yet Bills of Credit are not included in that &s;ection at all, notwith&s;tanding which, it is called a pro|vi&s;ion to the &s;econd &s;ection; with an eye to &s;uperior ad|vantage, they a&s;cribe a ridiculous motive to the Legi&s;|lature: that by the Act of April 7th 1791, the arrange|ment which is injurious refers only to the Act of March 1789, as an arrangement for the <HI>future:</HI> The State <HI>may</HI> deem it proper to make &s;uch for the purpo&s;e of avoiding any interference with the State or dome&s;tic &s;ub&s;cription.</P>
<P>Had it been the rea&s;on the State would have actually a&s;&s;umed her dome&s;tic debt.</P>
<P>It was ea&s;y to tell the amount of what was out&s;tand|ing.</P>
<P>It was only to conduct the out&s;tanding from tho&s;e on hand; there was no difficulty; it was only to add or to &s;ubtract; the object was to leave greater room for tho&s;e
<PB N="396" REF="027132_0404_0FD351FEBA291960">
debts which were a greater and a more immediate bur|then on the State.</P>
<P>One of two things mu&s;t be their object.</P>
<P N="1">1. Either to narrow down the intere&s;t, or 2 To give a facility to re-exchanging, and to their &s;ub&s;cribing to the Continental loan; and in either ca&s;e the New-Loans would not be re-exchanged at all.</P>
<P>No other rea&s;on can be properly given for it; if we con&s;true the law liberally, and not fooli&s;hly.</P>
<P>It was contended, that if we &s;hould have con&s;trued the &s;ixth &s;ection literally, we could not have given it &s;o fooli&s;h a con&s;truction.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid the Comptroller committed him&s;elf by ren|dering an e&s;timate to the Governor. If a provi&s;ion is made in the &s;ixth &s;ection of the Act of the 10th of April 1792, there may be &s;ome rea&s;on for it; but if not, the &s;uppo&s;ition is un&s;upported.</P>
<P>Let us con&s;ider this a little; it is clear from the &s;e|cond &s;ection, that no provi&s;ion is made there for un|funded depreciation, and none for the New-Loans in the &s;ame &s;ection.</P>
<P>One of them it is agreed, and both, we contend, are included in the &s;ixth &s;ection; it is al&s;o clear that no certificates which are not included in the &s;econd &s;ection, can participate in the funds to be created by the &s;ale of 3 per cent. &s;tock; for that fund is limitted to the ob|jects therein enumerated.</P>
<P>It this be true then in an e&s;timate which was to direct the Executive in the &s;ale of 3 per cent. &s;tock, neither the unfunded depreciation nor New-Loans &s;hould have been included, even if the e&s;timate had been made after the Act for re-opening the loan had pa&s;&s;ed: But at all events, I a&s;k, how was it po&s;&s;ible that the two offi|cers, from the 13th to the 16th of April, could include in their e&s;timate objects that would be embraced even|tually, if at all by the &s;ixth &s;ection; whereas the Act of Congre&s;s of the 8th of May 1792, was not then pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of u&s;ing this con&s;truction of the law for their
<PB N="397" REF="027132_0405_0FD3525D43E60430">
own purpo&s;es, they are compelled to u&s;e it for our pur|po&s;es.</P>
<P>Let us for a moment &s;uppo&s;e, that the Legi&s;lature intended as they are inclined to have it, and &s;ee the con|&s;equences, and how do you find this con&s;truction of theirs, to work the de&s;truction of the debt? Their con|&s;truction is conjectural, u&s;ele&s;s and dangerous: If &s;ub|&s;cribability is the criterion, they are mi&s;taken in the premi&s;es; if the New-Loans are a debt, &s;ub&s;cribable and redeemable are convertible terms.</P>
<P>If the ideas are not to be collected from the Act it|&s;elf, then we &s;hall in time have an hundred laws in&s;tead of one, then an end to legi&s;lation.</P>
<P>Having made the&s;e ob&s;ervations on the fir&s;t articles re&s;pecting the law, I will in the next place treat of the the motives. But fir&s;t permit me to make &s;ome ob&s;er|vations re&s;pecting the three la&s;t articles of impeachment.</P>
<P>We avow the facts contained in the fifth article, de|fend the legality, and contend we had a right &s;o to do.</P>
<P>When the defendant a&s;&s;umed the office of Comptrol|ler-General, he did not relinqui&s;h the duties of a citi|zen. How far it may be good policy to pa&s;s inhibitory laws, and how far it may be improper, to pa&s;s &s;uch po&s;itive laws, until &s;uch laws are pa&s;&s;ed, we have cer|tainly a right, and until a que&s;tion is rai&s;ed on &s;uch po|&s;itive law, our actions cannot be impeachable.</P>
<P>We have heard from <HI>Wode&s;on</HI> that a public officer &s;hould have no intere&s;t di&s;tinct from the State.</P>
<P>Where is the force of this rea&s;oning? attend to the circum&s;tances. That impeachable matter mu&s;t be an injury to the State, and not the gain of the officer. Where is the injury to the commonwealth in this parti|cular? In what does it con&s;i&s;t? Does the payment of a ju&s;t and valid debt con&s;titute this injury and detriment? If &s;uch can be viewed in this light it is well worthy of ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The 6th and 7th articles aim to place us in a much more irk&s;ome and ugly &s;ituation, and here I cannot help remarking on what fell from the other &s;ide; that great
<PB N="398" REF="027132_0406_0FD3526CC5A7FF80">
merit is due to them for being able to &s;hew &s;o much, when from the heinou&s;ne&s;s of the fact, the Comptroller might conceal the whole matter; how &s;ingular, that this very proof and te&s;timony is evincive of our inno|cence. Nay, in this particular our accu&s;ers take merit, that they have &s;hewn and proven too much.</P>
<P>There is one thing common to both the&s;e articles, they infer property in the State, and make it by impli|cation nece&s;&s;ary, and from different premi&s;es; it is pre|&s;umable the framers of the&s;e articles thought property e&s;&s;ential to con&s;titute the offence.</P>
<P>In the &s;ixth article it is inferred from the certificates being lodged for the purpo&s;e of being re-exchanged. It may well be a&s;ked, Had the owner no controul over them, what was his ultimate object? On what condi|tion were they to become the property of the common|wealth?</P>
<P>Sir, the Act was only inchoate, indents were to be paid, or received. Could the State withhold the certi|ficates if the party choo&s;e to withdraw them? Would it not be liable to execution as the property of the party? No doubt of it.</P>
<P>The committee, who were the drawers of this article, have &s;hewn their idea that this conclu&s;ion was weak, and un&s;ound, for if this con&s;tituted property, the fifth article would be nugatory and unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>(The fifth article was then read.) This gives a defini|tion of the exchange. The committee have plainly di&s;|covered that the facts in the &s;ixth may be demurred to.</P>
<P>What is the proof brought forward to &s;upport this 7th article? It is &s;aid Mr. <HI>Blair M'Clenachan</HI> was once the proprietor of a certificate which he never &s;old to us, and they endeavour to throw the burthen of the proof on us. This witne&s;s &s;peaking from memory, &s;ays he did not receive this certificate from <HI>Matthew M'Connell,</HI> he does not pretend to &s;ay that he &s;old or exchanged this or any other certificate with the Compt|troller-General; but he tells us expre&s;sly that he &s;old to others.</P>
<P><PB N="399" REF="027132_0407_0FD3526FF9F43268">Let us examine this a little&punc; He &s;ays he did not re|ceive our certificate of &pound;. 3275:19:4 from <HI>Matthew M'Connell,</HI> this he ab&s;olutely received in April 1788.</P>
<P>The witne&s;s, who is brought forward is unable to prove how he came by any of his certificates.</P>
<P>This idea involves a new and delicate point of law, taken from analogy in other criminal ca&s;es. When a felony or forgery is &s;worn to, and the in&s;trument with which the felony or forgery was committed be found on a per&s;on, the pre&s;umption is &s;o &s;trong, be|cau&s;e he has the thing wherewith the crime was per|petrated, that the party with whom the in&s;trument is found mu&s;t account. Here they &s;ay the witne&s;s did not &s;ell it to us; but they endeavour by the ab&s;ence of the fact to lay the burthen of proof on us, to make a cri|minal charge where there is no proof of criminality.</P>
<P>A certificate was once Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan's;</HI> one of two things mu&s;t be admitted. 1. That the certificate was exchanged, and criminally converted to our u&s;e; or, 2. We bought from &s;ome other per&s;on. It proves nothing again&s;t us. Out of the two modes, which is mo&s;t pre&s;umable? one is a fair purcha&s;e in a circuitous route, the other a criminal conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>Is there a criminal tribunal on earth which would ad|mit a proof &s;o nugatory to &s;upport and enforce a pro&s;e|cution? Need I a&s;k which will be cho&s;en. Is the heavi|e&s;t and mo&s;t attrocious item to be &s;upported by the &s;lighte&s;t proof, by the vague remnants of a memory frail in its be&s;t e&s;tate? If this were &s;upported as it is repre&s;ented, the breath of the offender might taint the walls that hold him. But we find a mill-&s;tone in the articles, and a feather in the proof.</P>
<P>Sir, I do not fear, becau&s;e I do not believe that this tribunal will find it to their &s;atisfaction to convict a re&s;|pectable fellow-citizen and a re&s;pon&s;ible officer upon a ra&s;h and dangerous implication upon evidence &s;o trif|ling and indefinite, and that too going to a charge per|fectly vague in it&s;elf and general as the light we &s;ee by.</P>
<P>This brings me to the &s;econd divi&s;ion of my &s;ubject,

<P>Mr. HIGGINSON.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Senate,</HI></P>
<P>Length of duty this forenoon has given me a violent head ache, I hope the Senate will adjourn; I will take but an hour in the morning: In the mean time I will concentrate my ideas, &s;o that I &s;hall not take up much of your time.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Morris</HI> informed him, that the Senate were di&s;|po&s;ed to indulge him. Adjourned.</P>
<P>In the minutes of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives the following entry is recorded&mdash;</P>
<P>"In conformity to the re&s;olutions of the 25th Fe|bruary la&s;t, the Hou&s;e re&s;olved it&s;elf into a committee of the whole, in order to attend the trial of <HI>John Ni|chol&s;on,</HI> Comptroller-General of this commonwealth, now depending before the Senate, on the articles of im|peachment exhibited again&s;t him by the Hou&s;e of Re|pre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>"The Speaker quitted the chair and Mr. <HI>Wynkoop</HI> was placed therein.</P>

<HEAD>Twelfth day of the trial. <HI>WEDNESDAY, March 12.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Senate met pur&s;uant to adjournment; the members of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives in committee of the whole repaired to the Senate-chamber as u&s;ual; the Comptroller-General uniformly kept his &s;eat as de|&s;cribed in page 202, and wrote without cea&s;ing, as well during the time employed by his own coun&s;el in the defence, as by the oppo&s;ite party.</P>
<P>Mr. HIGGINSON &s;poke as follows&mdash;</P>
<P>Having ye&s;terday ob&s;erved on all the articles of im|peachment, except the third article; as it re&s;pects mat|ter of evidence in &s;upporting the criminal intent in re|deeming or cau&s;ing to be redeemed New-Loans: I will make &s;ome remarks on that head, and the circum&s;tances which evince the integrity of the officer now upon trial.</P>
<P>To introduce this, it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that, out of the doubtfulne&s;s of the que&s;tion on the law it&s;elf, if on all hands the con&s;truction of the &s;everal Acts has created embarra&s;&s;ment, it will be remembered, that on the reading of the report to the Lower Hou&s;e, after the committee had had the &s;ubject before them a very long time, Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> apologized for that delay by inform|ing the Hou&s;e that they had waited &s;ome time for the opinion of the Attorney-General of the United States (Mr. <HI>Randolph.)</HI></P>
<P>If their charity hath begun at home, I hope yours will not end there.</P>
<P>The Secretary of the Trea&s;ury doubted the con&s;truc|tion of the Act of March 1789, and deemed it &s;o
<PB N="403" REF="027132_0411_0FD351D33A7B63C8">
doubtful a que&s;tion as to induce him to con&s;ult the law officer of the general government.</P>
<P>Now, &s;ir, let it be recollected, that in ordinary and per&s;picuous ca&s;es, this recour&s;e is never had to profe&s;|&s;ional and official opinion. From this, then, it may fairly be inferred that this ca&s;e was not ordinarily per|&s;picuous.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;tate the degree of per&s;picuity which is nece&s;&s;ary for any particular mind to found a conclu&s;ion upon.</P>
<P>But if the mind of the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury in con&s;idering the ca&s;e from the relation that every law bore to the &s;ubject, partook of the&s;e embarra&s;&s;ments, how ea&s;y is it to conceive that from the <HI>bona fide</HI> con|&s;truction of the Comptroller-General, that deci&s;ion might have re&s;ulted, the con&s;equence of which was the redemption of the&s;e certificates.</P>
<P>If then there was this want of per&s;picuity that cre|ated on all hands he&s;itation and embarra&s;&s;ment, it would have been highly u&s;eful and proper in the Legi&s;lature to have given to this &s;ection a clearne&s;s incapable of being mi&s;taken. If upon laws of uncertain con&s;truc|tion, every error that an officer commits in following the dictates of his own judgment, &s;hould be liable to impeachments, &s;uch po&s;ts mu&s;t have been de&s;erted, or held on a &s;lipp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">dge, and at a great hazard, when every &s;tep may be that of de&s;truction.</P>
<P>But in the &s;econd place with regard to their &s;ub&s;crib|ability, other officers of eminence, of talents and in|tegrity, concurred in opinion with the officer now un|der con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Sir, it is in te&s;tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> that the Secretary of the Trea|&s;ury pending the fir&s;t loan was of opinion, that the New-Loans were &s;ub&s;cribable, and gave &s;uch an opi|nion to the Continental Loan-officer, and that the bu&s;i|ne&s;s is not to this moment decided upon, and he men|tioned the &s;ame to the commi&s;&s;ioner afore&s;aid (&s;ee page 273-4-5.) "I do not con&s;ider you as ju&s;tifiiable." &amp;c.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> a law officer of the government, was
<PB N="404" REF="027132_0412_0FD352BF8019F870">
of this opinion, a gentleman well qualified, and of much integrity. What is to be inferred from the &s;ilence of all the State officers during the demand of the Con|tinental certificates? they all held the &s;ame opinion. (The letter, page 102, was then read.)</P>
<P>If the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury had been unacquainted with the law, were the Governor and Secretary of the commonwealth ignorant? The whole tenor of this letter nece&s;&s;arily implies the &s;en&s;e of the writer to be that the New-Loans were liable to be a&s;&s;umed, for the whole pro|vi&s;ion being to prevent the payment of intere&s;t twice on the &s;ame &s;um; no que&s;tion could ari&s;e out of it with re|gard to the New-Loans, without their being &s;ub&s;crib|able: In all, the <HI>&s;u&s;pen&s;ion of intere&s;t</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;umability</HI> were the principal things to be con&s;idered. If any doubt had exi&s;ted with the Governor, would he not have &s;ifted it to the bottom? If any doubt remained re&s;pecting their &s;ub&s;cribability, would they not endeavour to clear up the matter?</P>
<P>With regard to the Secretary of the commonwealth, there is a circum&s;tance which &s;trongly corroborates the a&s;&s;ertion, that he mu&s;t be &s;atisfied of the &s;ub&s;cribability of the New-Loans. He appeared to be &s;urpri&s;ed when the matter of the a&s;&s;umption was communicated to him; this information &s;eemed to run counter to his judgment! The Secretary had &s;een Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on's</HI> plan of finance, in that plan the New-Loans are recognized as a debt; he approved of the plan, (&s;ee his letter page 286.) It came before him with its "prominent fea|tures;" the plan put the New-Loans on the &s;ame foot|ing with other debts of the commonwealth. Why &s;ur|pri&s;ed? Perhaps the rea&s;on may be, becau&s;e there was no redemption law at that time. Is that a rea&s;on? Why? certainly not.</P>
<P>Further, It is given in te&s;timony that after &s;everal conferences the Regi&s;ter-General concurred in opinion with the Comptroller-General, and that the accounts contained &s;ome certificates depreciated on the principal which no body could mi&s;take for any other than New-Loans;
<PB N="405" REF="027132_0413_0FD35270C36504C0">
the probability is, that the &s;ame was redeemed; immaterial whether before or after our ab&s;tract, which had been <HI>bona fide</HI> pre&s;ented and redeemed: Yet this man, whom they repre&s;ent as hackneyed in perfidy, this man who veiled and ma&s;ked the proceedings to delude the other officers of government into error is found expre&s;sly to have communicated with them, while they partici|pated in the conviction which that conference produced.</P>
<P>The next rea&s;on, then, that I would offer is that the Comptroller-General held the &s;ame opinion on the a&s;|&s;umability of the New-Loans, long before the Act of April 10, 1792, by which alone he became intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, From the te&s;timony of the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury (page 287-8-9.) 2dly, From the Comptroller's own letter to Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> the Loan-officer (page 271-2) eighteen months before the redemption law. Nothing is clearer than that the writer of this letter was confi|dent that the New-Loans were a&s;&s;umable, although he was convinced they would not be offered &s;ubject to the di&s;advantages of the funding law.</P>
<P>It was again&s;t the intere&s;t of the New-Loan holders to &s;ub&s;cribe them, it was for their intere&s;t to exchange them for Continental certificates, and then to &s;ub&s;cribe tho&s;e. In the next place, the &s;ame opinion is al&s;o ex|pre&s;&s;ed in his letter (page 220-1-2) to the Governor. I a&s;k whether it is po&s;&s;ible for any thing to expre&s;s more clearly and unequivocally his opinion of their being a debt due from the &s;tate, and of their &s;ub&s;cribability; it &s;eems from the former part of this letter that the Se|cretary of the Trea&s;ury had taken higher ground, and demanded a &s;urrender of Continental certificates equal to the amount of New-Loans out&s;tanding; or &s;u&s;pend the payment of intere&s;t, this it is evident had been ac|tually relinqui&s;hed by the Secretary.</P>
<P>Hitherto the current of te&s;timony &s;ets in, &s;trongly, on the &s;ide of innocence. (His next letter to the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, page 277, then read.)</P>
<P>It will be remembered that in the letter of the 24th December 1791, five days before this, the Comptrol|ler
<PB N="406" REF="027132_0414_0FD3527259134408">
tells the Governor, that none of the New-Loans were actually &s;ub&s;cribed; though they were &s;ub&s;cribable, and therefore there was no need of a &s;urrender. This was the object of the negociation, and therefore he in|forms the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury of the &s;ame thing; that if a doubt &s;hould ari&s;e, whether part of the <HI>a&s;&s;um|ed</HI> or &s;ub&s;cribed debt of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> does not con&s;i&s;t of New-Loans, it can be ea&s;ily proved it does not. No body can doubt this to be the meaning, when they recollect that in his former letter to the Governor, and that to Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> he not only recognized them to be &s;ub&s;cribable, but &s;aid they were not, or would not be &s;ub&s;cribed; it being again&s;t the intere&s;t of the holders.</P>
<P>Still le&s;s &s;hall we doubt it, when we turn to the let|ter (page 278) wherein we trace the &s;ame &s;entiments.</P>
<P>(The letter page 223-4 was then read.)</P>
<P>Thus, we &s;ee the con&s;i&s;tency and uniformity of the officer now on defence, in per&s;evering in the &s;ame opi|nion for the &s;pace of eighteen months before he became intere&s;ted. Sir, I think this gives a mortal blow to the pro&s;ecution, and the charge of fraud vani&s;hes like the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a vi&s;ion, which leaves not a wreck behind. But this is not all, for if we de&s;cend to the particular periods when the tran&s;actions took place, we &s;hall di&s;cover there, al&s;o, a train of co-temporary facts, equally invulnerable and conclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>The next rea&s;on which I &s;hall offer, ari&s;es from the caution which he gave the members of the Legi&s;lature when the redemption law was under con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>When the extent of that law was in contemplation, when gentlemen undertake to paint the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and ruinous con&s;equences to the &s;tate, which would follow the admi&s;&s;ion of the New-Loans to &s;weep away the whole quota of the a&s;&s;umption of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> while at the &s;ame time it ab&s;orbed the &s;pecie from her trea|&s;ury; let them have the charity to remember that this officer, who&s;e &s;pirit they are now grieving, rai&s;ed his voice and hands again&s;t that dangerous proceeding at that time. This is not the language of di&s;grace.</P>
<P><PB N="407" REF="027132_0415_0FD35274AA0A5440">But, again; the tran&s;actions were conducted in the u&s;ual forms of office, and in his own name; and it is remarkable that the committee on who&s;e report this impeachment was founded, gave their opinion in that report, that the &s;aid <HI>John Nichol&s;on</HI> has been guilty of a high mi&s;demeanor for two rea&s;ons, one of which was that he pa&s;&s;ed and certified the New-Loans to the Ex|ecutive in the u&s;ual forms of office, thereby cau&s;ing them to be redeemed. The jet of the rea&s;on is in the <HI>"u&s;ual forms"</HI> of office, by which they were redeemed.</P>
<P>If then forms had been unu&s;ual, the very &s;ingularity would have been <HI>prima facie,</HI> a pre&s;umption and evi|dence of other than ordinary de&s;ign or intention, this charge is indeed to make the u&s;ual cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s the evidence of guilt.</P>
<P>A like charge and equally unimportant appears to me the matters contained in the third article of impeach|ment.</P>
<P>This article is mean in &s;ub&s;tance, and pitifully drawn: The fir&s;t thing &s;ingular is, that they begin with the cri|minality and go on to the facts. "In order to promote and procure his own emolument," &amp;c. till it was actu|ally reduced to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, implying, that after the emo|lument was reduced to actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, there was a certainty or probability of detection; this idea is too futile, nobody in their &s;en&s;es will believe this to be true; for what purpo&s;e could it an&s;wer to deceive for the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, when certain detection was to follow it? Again in order to avoid "di&s;covery till" &amp;c. "he did not con|&s;ult the Regi&s;ter-General," implying that after the emo|luments were in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he did con&s;ult the Re|gi&s;ter-General: Let me a&s;k, how came this peculiar phra&s;eology to be given to this article?</P>
<P>We have had the hi&s;tory of that from Mr. <HI>Gallatin,</HI> who was the principal member of the Hou&s;e of Repre|&s;entatives at the time, we have been informed that upon the examination of the Regi&s;ter-General, although not examined upon oath, the fir&s;t part of this article was founded.</P>
<P><PB N="408" REF="027132_0416_0FD352124B7EFA58">It was found, that, after mo&s;t of the ab&s;tracts had pa&s;|&s;ed and the Comptroller-General had actually received the amount of his; there was a con&s;ultation among the officers, when the Regi&s;ter fully concurred in opinion with the Comptroller-General, and although there were &s;ufficient di&s;tingui&s;hing marks on the face of the ab|&s;tracts, to a&s;certain that New-Loans were contain|ed in them; and although the&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing marks were in a part to which the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of the Re|gi&s;ter was confined, namely the calculation of intere&s;t, and therefore, it was no fault of the Comptroller-Gener|al that they were not &s;ooner known, and although the Regi&s;ter declared that when they were known, he was fully of the &s;ame opinion, and accordingly officially pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome ab&s;tracts afterwards, knowing them to be New-Loans; yet the committee, for&s;ooth, in&s;tead of throwing a&s;ide the article as un&s;upported, re&s;olved to amend the article, to &s;uit the te&s;timony whatever it might be, in order that the Comptroller-General might be &s;et for a while on the &s;tool of repentance; becau&s;e the Regi&s;ter-General in calculating intere&s;t on a certifi|cate depreciated on the principal, was not &s;agacious e|nough to find out that it was a New-Loan, and there|fore in the true &s;tyle of the dramati&s;t, the pa&s;&s;ion for incident is to ab&s;orb every other faculty.</P>
<P>But, Sir, let me proceed to the facts, facts! Did I &s;ay? I was wrong, &s;ir, there is not a &s;ingle fact charg|ed in this article, they are only omi&s;&s;ions. That "he did not con&s;ult the Regi&s;ter-General, nor communicate the matter to the Governor" before he got his money, and that he did not di&s;criminate between the New-Loans and others. It is pretended, that this was an incum|bent duty on him, the contrary is clear, for neither did his duty require it, nor the u&s;age or practice of the officers make it nece&s;&s;ary. It is not &s;hewn to be his duty but it has been ob&s;erved that in &s;o important a ca&s;e, he ought to u&s;e &s;ome works of &s;upererrogation.</P>
<P><PB N="409" REF="027132_0417_0FD351D580F898A0">Is it &s;ingular that a man &s;hould be charged criminal|ly, for the omi&s;&s;ion of that which avowedly was not required of him by law?</P>
<P>As to his certifications to Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> the Loan-officer, I conceive them to be out of the que&s;tion, for the&s;e rea|&s;ons. 1. He was not acting then as an officer at all, but having received a letter from Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> reque&s;ting in|formation, he gives it as a friend to the be&s;t of his know|ledge. 2. As he was not then performing a duty im|po&s;ed on him in his official capacity, &s;o neither was Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> who received the information, bound to give any credit to it, unle&s;s he choo&s;e to do &s;o. 3. As that in|formation was for the United States, and not this &s;tate, if that information was attended with lo&s;s or injury, the government of the Union alone have a right to com|plain.</P>
<P>The certifications and proceedings with regard to our own &s;tate were in the u&s;ual forms of office; no certifi|cates were more particularly &s;et forth or de&s;cribed than others. The New-Loans them&s;elves were &s;peci|fically a&s;certainable from the variety of dates in the commencement of intere&s;t, which no officer with &s;u|perficial attention could overlook.&mdash;Be&s;ides this, one certificate in the &s;ub&s;cription of the Comptroller-Ge|neral was depreciated on the principal, it was not po&s;|&s;ible to mi&s;take that for any other than a New-Loan; therefore the certification of <HI>genuine</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;umable</HI> being done at the reque&s;t of individuals, and in no in&s;tance of the Comptroller's own &s;ub&s;cription, it was a labour without the &s;malle&s;t intere&s;t or profit: If then this mi|nute of <HI>genuine</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;umable,</HI> had no &s;ort of influence in the right or que&s;tion of &s;ub&s;cribing them, in what &s;hape can it be criminal? The &s;ub&s;cription was in his own name al&s;o. Sir, however this may be lightly &s;po|ken of, yet to a&s;certain the motive it is of the fir&s;t im|portance: As the&s;e certificates were payable to bearer it was in his power to have them &s;ub&s;cribed in the name of &s;ome unknown per&s;on, and his intere&s;t in them could not have been di&s;covered; the whole tran&s;action becomes
<PB N="410" REF="027132_0418_0FD352788553F7C8">
an ea&s;y riddle in&s;tead of a well concerted plot, this cir|cum&s;tance aro&s;e from con&s;cious rectitude of mind, with that fearle&s;s independence, which is the noble&s;t a&s;&s;oci|ate of hone&s;ty and its &s;ure&s;t indication.</P>
<P>Another rea&s;on: Sir, it is notorious, when the im|peachment was brought forward he &s;olicited an imme|diate trial: it is not the part of con&s;cious wickedne&s;s to court enquiry, but to dread and procra&s;tinate it even when it is unavoidable, yes time and delay are the only harbours of guilt! the&s;e things may be fetters to the guilty; but they are wings to the innocent, when he was impeached, he flew to met the pro&s;ecution. I will not enquire for what purpo&s;e that accu&s;ation &s;lept in impotent ab&s;traction in the bo&s;om of a numerous com|mittee, till the very clo&s;e of the &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Although many months have elap&s;ed &s;ince this im|peachment was preferred, although the committe of in|ve&s;tigation, have u&s;ed every effort during the rece&s;s, after trying by every means to di&s;cover official frauds, yet they have been unable to fa&s;ten on a &s;ingle in&s;tance of the &s;ort, among the numerous documents and the voluminous records of that department; but they have laid their hands on a &s;olitary fellow-citizen, the dark and doubtful corners of who&s;e memory they have ran|&s;acked again and again, with the plea&s;ing hope of di&s;|covering the thong that would bind in di&s;grace an ob|noxious tran&s;gre&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>I will not pretend to &s;ay, that the motive for po&s;tpon|ing the inve&s;tigation was to &s;u&s;pend him during the va|cation as a culprit with his lips &s;ealed for the hand of &s;corn to point his &s;low and moving finger at. I will not &s;ay that it was to rake up the a&s;hes of long-forgot|ten tran&s;actions, in hopes, that while the memory had lo&s;t the co-temporary circum&s;tances nece&s;&s;ary to explain them, they might by the breath of &s;u&s;picion and party be invigorated and matured into a crime: But I will &s;ay, that whatever be the motives for po&s;tponing it, the impul&s;e in the accu&s;ed in &s;oliciting an immediate trial, could be no other than the impul&s;e of innocence.</P>
<P><PB N="411" REF="027132_0419_0FD3527A8FFE3530">Sir, need I mention that &s;uch a thing would be again&s;t his real and &s;ub&s;tantial intere&s;t; on this ground the gen|tlemen have placed the corner-&s;tone of this pro&s;ecution. Common &s;en&s;e decides that the eventual emolument of this officer can have no operation as a proof of guilt.</P>
<P>It is under&s;tood in the fir&s;t place, that he directly con|travened his own intere&s;t in cautioning the members of the Legi&s;lature when the Act was under con&s;ideration. For laying it down as a principle that every man is mo&s;t &s;trongly inclined to make gain. He was either po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e certificates at the time the redemption law pa&s;&s;ed, and was of opinion that the law would warrant the con&s;truction it received, or he had them not at the time, and thought the law would not bear that con|&s;truction; now, if he was not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them at the time, there was nothing to induce him to purcha&s;e them, as he had nothing to lo&s;e, and having given his opinion again&s;t them, he would have no motive in becoming po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them, but a firm belief that the Act would warrant their redemption. If he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them, or if he was not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them, but only intended to become &s;o, he certainly would not have interpo&s;ed his opinion at the time, as it might be expected that it would have produced an amendment to the &s;ixth &s;ec|tion of the Act, by the introduction of &s;ome negative words. In the next place, it is not a difficult ta&s;k to &s;e|parate the appearance of truth in this &s;ort of argument from the real fallacy which gives it a direction again&s;t the officer now on trial; as it is to be under&s;tood that his eventual emolument is contended for, as the &s;trong|e&s;t proof of guilt; and this is certainly nothing at all.</P>
<P>Let us examine the <HI>truth</HI> or <HI>fallacy</HI> of the&s;e tran&s;ac|tions.</P>
<P>I take it that in the event, intere&s;t or &s;peculation might re&s;ult from either ca&s;e.</P>
<P>If he corruptly put a deci&s;ion upon the law, contrary to his real opinion, &s;peculation and intere&s;t was his ob|ject. But I pre&s;ume this emolument as we find it, would have followed the con&s;truction it&s;elf, whether

that con&s;truction originated in an hone&s;t or di&s;hone&s;t motive. In the one ca&s;e, if he acted from a di&s;hone&s;t mo|tive, &s;peculation was his object, and he acted corruptly. In the other if he acted from an hone&s;t motive, &s;pecu|lation was the effect. In the one ca&s;e he would &s;pecu|late becau&s;e he had &s;o decided the law, in the other he would &s;o decide the law, becau&s;e he had predetermin|ed to &s;peculate; &s;o that the argument of emolument is thus far as broad as it is long; but I apprehend on a clo&s;er in&s;pection it will be found again&s;t the pro&s;ecu|tion and in favor of innocence.</P>
<P>One fact is certain, that a profit has re&s;ulted to the officer, it's mother was either hone&s;ty or corruption, let it's parentage be decided by natural and fair pro|babilities; arguing from the effect to the cau&s;e. It is a fair rule of ju&s;tice and common &s;en&s;e, that effects in the natural world &s;hall be attributed to the mo&s;t proba|ble and the mo&s;t natural cau&s;es, and in moral ca&s;es to the mo&s;t innocent cau&s;es. This emolument might re|&s;ult from hone&s;t or di&s;hone&s;t cau&s;es: In the one ca&s;e, &s;peculation and emolument is the natural and legitimate effect of a con&s;truction fairly and hone&s;tly put upon the Act. In the other, it is the corrupt pretext for a con|&s;truction incon&s;i&s;tent with the opinion of the party u&s;ing it, and pro&s;ecuted at once again&s;t honor and hone&s;ty. So far are they from proving any thing, that their argu|ment of guilt mu&s;t be de&s;erted, unle&s;s &s;ome other &s;trong leading circum&s;tances can be brought forward to its &s;up|port. Are there any others? No. So far from being able to bring forward any proof to convict the defendant, that all their arguments &s;eem to militate again&s;t them&s;elves, and every circum&s;tance adduced by them, &s;eems to favor the cau&s;e of innocence.</P>
<P>But the&s;e ob&s;ervations might be &s;pared, for how un|&s;peakbly ab&s;urd is the argument of intere&s;t when placed in contact with &s;ome part of the te&s;timony. It has been proved by te&s;timony in profu&s;ion, that this of|ficer entertained the &s;ame opinion as to the a&s;&s;umability ot the&s;e certificates, pending the fir&s;t loan of Congre&s;s,

and long before our redemption law pa&s;&s;ed, as he does now.</P>
<P>Sir, can we believe that it was the hope of intere&s;t which &s;upported this officer through tho&s;e &s;cenes of de|ception, before the Act, which in fact created it, was in exi&s;tence? Behold then the gordian knot untied, for the argument of intere&s;t to have force mu&s;t take it for granted, that this officer, while he expre&s;&s;ed his opinion unequivocally eighteen months before the Act of April 1792, fore&s;aw neverthele&s;s, that &s;uch a law would pa&s;s and afford him an occa&s;ion of profit; nay, further it mu&s;t be taken for granted that his coincidence of opinion with the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, and other officers of the &s;tate and general, government &s;o long be|fore the time, was a game of hypocri&s;y, which his cun|ning induced him to play to conceal the mercenary de|&s;igns which futurity was to gratify.</P>
<P>Behold then this rope of &s;and, will this then, bind a victim to the altar? Can we believe that it was the hope of intere&s;t which &s;upported this officer through tho&s;e &s;cenes of deception before the Act had an exi&s;tence? For if intere&s;t was at that moment the embryo motive of his heart; if he could at that di&s;tance of time fore|&s;ee the growing harve&s;t; while he prepared his &s;ickle to partake of it, in&s;tead of being arraigned as a culprit he &s;hould be deified as a prophet.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Speaker,</HI></P>
<P>IN a public point of view it is much to be regretted that charges of &s;uch &s;erious magnitude and importance, &s;hould be thus built upon the &s;lendere&s;t foundation.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved by &s;ome parliamentary &s;peakers, I be|lieve (by <HI>Che&s;terfield,)</HI> that accu&s;ations by impeachment are not &s;o likely to be well founded as pre&s;entments by grand juries, for while in the one ca&s;e political objects and party &s;pirit are mo&s;t apt to govern the accu&s;ers, in the other they are generally governed by the di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate and impartial dictates of judgement operating on the weight of evidence. The hi&s;tory of impeachments in
<PB N="414" REF="027132_0422_0FD3527D4BA8BDC0">
<HI>England</HI> verifies this idea, and confirms its truth, per|haps, Sir, in a more popular government this circum|&s;tance and its con&s;equences are the more dangerous.</P>
<P>It augurs not well of the public weal in a free coun|try, where all officers depend directly or remotely on the voice of the people, to find them &s;wept away from the port of confidence by the plea of groundle&s;s accu&s;ation.</P>
<P>An impeachment is an engine of State as &s;acred in its nature, as it is delicate in its con&s;truction, and no|thing but imminent danger will warrant the u&s;e of it, the danger of falling a &s;acrifice to popular indignation, which &s;ometimes even merit has provoked, or to party re&s;entment, of all the re&s;entments the mo&s;t implacable, will enhance the difficulty of procuring good officers, while it depreciates the incentives to virtuous actions in tho&s;e who are &s;uch; while events are our preceptors, and have taught us, that we &s;hould give to government only the &s;ame enlightened &s;elf intere&s;t, which is granted to a good man in the ordinary concerns of human life.</P>
<P>Let then the &s;word of the people be &s;u&s;pended over the heads of their &s;ervants, but let not its de&s;cent be &s;o accidental or precarious that like the &s;word of <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> over the head of <HI>Damocles,</HI> it &s;hould be as much the tormentor of the faithful, as the &s;courge of the unju&s;t.</P>
<P>Sir, the officer now on defence, di&s;cards all fear, he provokes no compa&s;&s;ion, he &s;olicits no favor, he de|mands but ju&s;tice. Here are facts on which he chal|lenges your con&s;ciences, and defies your per&s;ua&s;ion. Winnow the chaff from the &s;ub&s;tance and the breath of heaven will di&s;&s;ipate it, &s;o that it cannot be gather|ed. To con&s;true a law is an act of the under&s;tanding, how wide is the difference between intelligence and in|tegrity.</P>
<P>Let then the records of this tribunal, which his accu&s;|ers had de&s;tined to emblazon his di&s;grace, harmonize with the decrees of time, the great arbiter of reputa|tion; nay, the decrees of that arbiter who is greater than time, and greater than heaven it&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SAMUEL DEXTER, jun. <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI> Member of Congre&s;s from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts!</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Mr. Speaker, and
Gentlemen of the Senate,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS &s;ubject is very complicated in its nature, and my attention hath been much attracted to other objects, and interrupted in the &s;tudy of this ca&s;e: So &s;ingular were my circum&s;tances that at the fir&s;t appearance I might rea&s;onably claim an apology. A &s;tranger invited to appear before this re&s;pectable body, nay, invited by the honorable Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> to lend his aid to defend their cau&s;e, and a&s;&s;ert their rights; my obligation was multiplied, when I con&s;i|dered the importance of the honorable Hou&s;e who made the application; con&s;cious as I have been, that I &s;hall not be able to add to the rea&s;oning of the enlightened gentlemen (Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Morgan</HI> and <HI>Rawle)</HI> who preceded me on the &s;ame &s;ide; perhaps prudence would have induced me to decline; but when called upon by &s;o re|putable a Legi&s;lature, nay, a &s;tranger &s;olicited to de|fend the cau&s;e of the public, and to redre&s;s their wrongs again&s;t one of their own citizens, loaded with the wealth and &s;poils of the commonwealth!</P>
<P>This con&s;ideration commanded my exertions and magnanimity; the invitation was too flattering, I could not refu&s;e my aid; I will not wa&s;te your time in making prefatory ob&s;ervations, but will endeavor to make the cau&s;e now before the honorable Senate very intelligible, and therefore will divide the &s;ubject into four points.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Has the defendant cau&s;ed New-Loans to be &s;ub&s;crib|ed, which were not &s;ub&s;cribable by law?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Has he cau&s;ed New-Loans to be redeemed, when by law they were not redeemable, and thereby had broken and violated the Con&s;titution of this commonwealth?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Has he not appropriated to his own u&s;e New-Loan certificates which had been &s;urrendered to the common|wealth by the holders, and &s;hould have been cancelled?</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="416" REF="027132_0424_0FD3525078DB8AC0">4. <HI>Has he not done all this knowingly and corruptly to make unju&s;t gain, betraying the intere&s;t repo&s;ed in him, and traded on the public confidence?</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e divi&s;ions were nece&s;&s;ary before I begin to an|&s;wer the objections which have been rai&s;ed again&s;t the forms of the&s;e articles of impeachment; but no far|ther advantage can be taken of them, as to their form; they are not deficient either in &s;ub&s;tance or form&mdash;as to forms, two things are only nece&s;&s;ary, 1&s;t. They &s;hould be clear to be under&s;tood. 2d. They &s;hould be a com|tent plea in di&s;charge of another pro&s;ecution for the &s;ame offence.</P>
<P>To make objections to mere forms, the reliques of antient times, I &s;ay, times of darkne&s;s and ignorance, is like the ob&s;ervation re&s;pecting the nets and the traps in which he had been caught: The articles are &s;ufficiently definite, and an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of ju&s;tice in trials by impeachment. Mere forms are never attended to in &s;uch ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Impeachments &s;hould be &s;o worded, as to an&s;wer two purpo&s;es, 1&s;t. They &s;hould be definite. 2d. They ought to be &s;ub&s;tantial as to form: The articles under con&s;i|deration are &s;ufficiently <HI>definite</HI> and &s;ub&s;tantial, to an&s;wer the&s;e two purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>We have been told that the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;ent|atives adopted this as a mode of <HI>per&s;ecuting,</HI> rather than <HI>pro&s;ecuting.</HI></P>
<P>That honorable body does not wi&s;h to per&s;ecute, the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Legi&s;lature is primarily the protec|tion of the innocent; the protection of the innocent is of greater importance than the puni&s;hment of the guil|ty; yet it is of &s;ome importance to the community when a public defaulter is puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>A man who is clearly charged with &s;uch crimes, it is not unimportant to the public to know how he can acquit him&s;elf, and how he hath di&s;charged his tru&s;t; although it is irritating to any Legi&s;lature to pro&s;ecute &s;uch an offender as the pre&s;ent defendant.</P>
<P>If zeal in the coun&s;el who have appeared for the
<PB N="417" REF="027132_0425_0FD3525EBA97C568">
Comptroller-General, had been an evidence of inno|cence, the defendant ought to be acquitted; never had any defendant more brilliant di&s;play of rhetoric, or apparition of rea&s;on, to prevent his being found guilty, than the Comptroller has had on this pre&s;ent trial.</P>
<P>In my arguments I will con&s;ider two things, to wit, the law and the te&s;timony; in the way that I have divi|ed the &s;ubject, the different con&s;tructions of the Acts of A&s;&s;embly as they &s;eem to favour or make again&s;t the the defendant &s;hall be attended to. The con&s;truction of the Act of 1786 relative the the i&s;&s;uing of New-Loans is perhaps doubtful, and unimportant; if the defendant's con&s;truction is the true one, what will be the i&s;&s;ue? But it will be very material if our con&s;truc|tion is the right one, as guilt is charged home and fixt on him; if his con&s;truction is right, it by no means ac|quits him; and it will not ultimately determine the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Previou&s;ly to my entering further into this bu&s;ine&s;s, I will con&s;ider the cau&s;es and motives which produced the Acts. I will not read them, they have been alrea|dy repeated, no per&s;on can be better acquainted with them than the Speaker; it will not be controverted that the Act of 1785 was enacted as a temporary provi&s;ion for the payment of intere&s;ts, the Act of 1786 was pa&s;|&s;ed on the failure of the Act of 1785 for the &s;ame per|&s;ons and had the &s;ame general object in view, and brought the Act of 1785 into execution.</P>
<P>I can &s;ee no rea&s;on why the Legi&s;lature in 1786 &s;hould make that perpetual, which in 1785 was temporary. There is neither rea&s;on nor equity for it; if equity did not require it, there was no rea&s;on to grant it. This is pro&s;trating the principles of ju&s;tice; the Legi&s;lature would not unnece&s;&s;arily encrea&s;e its own burthen.</P>
<P>The Gentleman's rea&s;oning, who opened the defence is &s;omewhat &s;ingular; he &s;ays it became "an equitable claim," &s;o far I agree with the Gentleman. But, Sir, will the gentleman go on, and &s;ay, that the contract was not as great to the inhabitants of all the other States who have been creditors of the Union, more equity
<PB N="418" REF="027132_0426_0FD3527FFA1D8488">
was not due to the creditors citizens of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> than to the creditor citizens of other States; if the pre|mi&s;es are admitted, the con&s;equences can't be avoided.</P>
<P>Equity is not partial and would embrace the whole, this is clear rea&s;oning, he cannot deny it.</P>
<P>The Act of March 1786 did not, at all events, pledge the public faith for the redemption of tho&s;e certificates in money; if then it is viewed in this light, why did the State receive the Continental certificates and give their own certificates in lieu of them? The object of the Legi&s;lature was to make a &s;ub&s;titute. If <HI>Penn&s;yl|vania</HI> did not take the certificates, and was to pay, &s;he might do it at her lo&s;s, as &s;he could have no claim on Congre&s;s. This is confirmed from general opinion, and their &s;ub&s;equent views.</P>
<P>If the Trea&s;urer had paid off the Continental certi|ficates they could not i&s;&s;ue the New-Loans; and for this purpo&s;e <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> cho&s;e to take in the old Con|tinental certificates and i&s;&s;ue new ones, &s;o that the com|monwealth might at her option be the creditor of the Union, or debtor to her own citizens, by returning them to the original holders; in the mean time to &s;ettle and pay the intere&s;t was the intention of the Legi&s;lature: It is manife&s;t, and confirmed by the opinion of every per|&s;en conver&s;ant in the tran&s;actions of the A&s;&s;embly, and by the public Acts.</P>
<P>One circum&s;tance of great importance is to be attend|ed to; that is, the margin of the New-Loans and the reference to the Continental certificates; this provides how the debts were to be &s;ecured, and the memoran|dums made in the &s;ame.&mdash;<HI>(Here he read a New-Loan certificate.)</HI></P>
<P>This margin was of no con&s;equence unle&s;s they wi&s;h|ed to return the New-Loans. We here look for the intention of the Legi&s;lature, and not for the negligence of the executive officer. Was it of con&s;equence to pay in ca&s;h at all events, full intere&s;t on depreciated principal? this was not &s;ufficient for it might have been &s;ettled at the i&s;&s;uing, why not at the time reduce the
<PB N="419" REF="027132_0427_0FD35281440D6638">
certificate and give the whole amount when reduced by the &s;cale. If a purcha&s;e, it was worth ju&s;t as much as the value of the certificate's nominal amount of princi|pal and intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Another rea&s;on and a better one than the con&s;truction of the law, is the intention of the Legi&s;lature,</P>
<P>The preamble of the Act of March 27 1789, calls it a temporary provi&s;ion, look into the preamble of that Act, is a Legi&s;lative con&s;truction important, relying on the margin and memorandum in it, does all this weigh nothing?</P>
<P>Was it maneuvre in the Legi&s;lature? it is too di&s;re&s;|pectful, too indelicate to &s;uppo&s;e, out of the whole I find that the Act of 86 took the certificates into the cu&s;tody of the &s;tate and that they were only to pay the intere&s;t; if otherwi&s;e they would have found a fund to provide for the payment of the principal, they knew at that time the funds were precariou&s;ly in their hands, if &s;o, it would perhaps be wrong to contend that nothing more was in|tended than a re-exchange by the Act of 1786. There|fore the law of 1789 <HI>repealed nothing;</HI> but carried the Act of 1786 into effect.</P>
<P>The con&s;truction of the law of 1786 is much more certain and important. If we chu&s;e to take back our certificate at any time, we &s;hall have a right &s;o to do, to do away the&s;e they enacted the repealing law of 1789. The que&s;tion now is not whether the law is right or wrong, but what was the <HI>intention</HI> of the Legi&s;lature. If the law was right, it does away mo&s;t of the difficulty, the Act of 89 is an Act of much importance, of clear and certain con&s;truction, let us enquire what was the inten|tion of the Legi&s;lature, not whether it was con&s;titutional or not, the law is right or wrong only as the Legi&s;lature intended. After we &s;hall di&s;cover the intention we'll enquire if open under the Con&s;titution, and whether obligatory as a law is another que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The con&s;truction of the defendant is &s;o contradictory, &s;o di&s;torted, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> language can hardly find a de|finitive idea to corre&s;pond with it, he hardly knows
<PB N="420" REF="027132_0428_0FD351DC8B741548">
what an&s;wer to make, every thing he advances is direct|ly oppo&s;ite to what is mentioned in the Act, &s;o ob&s;tinate is every part of it in favour of the pro&s;ecution; and he is obliged to run counter to every expre&s;&s;ion in the law; if the Act of 1789 de&s;igned only to <HI>unfund the debt,</HI> it is equally unju&s;t with de&s;troying it, it is different not in principle but in degree. If it is &s;o, for what rea&s;on: It is alledged they could not de&s;troy the claim, is it not equal|ly a breach of contract to unfund as to de&s;troy it, truly equal; why unfund the <HI>principal</HI> that was never funded if the rea&s;oning of the Gentlemen be right, they &s;hould have followed wherever it led them; was it not equally &s;o to &s;ubtract the fund? What did the law of 89 do? They &s;ay it had no effect, it neither de&s;troyed nor anni|hilated the operations of the former Acts, yet the de|fendant mu&s;t admit that the &s;tate committed a fraud in unfunding the debt, the provi&s;ion was repealed, yet they &s;ay it was altogether compatible with the law of 1786.</P>
<P>If the alienation of the funds to the General Govern|ment had been the rea&s;on, was not that &s;urrender to be perpetual? Did they expect a return of the funds? If they were to pay the intere&s;t, why not the principal? Where were the funds? Where was the debt? It either proves too much, or it proves nothing at all; it em|braces both principal and intere&s;t, or only principal, and excludes the intere&s;t. If this is not broad enough for them, con&s;ider only for a moment the intention of the Legi&s;lature in pa&s;&s;ing the Act.</P>
<P>The declaration in the Act of 1789, proves they in|tended in 1786 to make a temporary provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>Could the Legi&s;lature labour a preamble declaring their intention, if they did not mean to carry that in|tention into effect?</P>
<P>The Legi&s;lature expre&s;ly &s;ays, the payment of the &s;aid debts ought to be from the Trea&s;ury of the United States, and not from <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI> A con&s;truction in the Act of 1786, to aboli&s;h the &s;ame Act, if there is no rea&s;on for doing away the Act of 1786, why labour
<PB N="421" REF="027132_0429_0FD351DF9B8E6D98">
three or four pages; to do what they did not intend to do.</P>
<P>Yet if the preamble is read, no man will doubt that they did intend to repeal the law, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the right to do &s;o; look further into it, you'll find the the words <HI>"certificates" "rea&s;onable,"</HI> &amp;c. there.</P>
<P>In fine, that the debts, not intere&s;t, is to be paid by Congre&s;s; there is another con&s;truction of the Act of 1789, almo&s;t too ingenuous to be admitted and not ea|&s;ily under&s;tood, operating not on what is done under the Act.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e of the North-Carolina certificates there was no Act to repeal, as the certificates had i&s;&s;ued frau|dulently.</P>
<P>It is a contradiction in rea&s;oning and almo&s;t in terms, do they provide that the principal &s;hall be paid by the State of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania?</HI> Perhaps the Gentlemen would have found no Act to de&s;troy, when they were not i&s;&s;u|ed by any Act. This long Act of 1789 was not made for nothing, the Act of 1786 was completed in 1788. There|fore the Legi&s;lature in repealing the Act, meant to knock away the foundation on which they &s;tood.</P>
<P>Here the con&s;truction is too artificial to be credible, the defence is at war with it&s;elf. Fir&s;t, that it did ope|rate on the certificates, 2dly, It did not operate. This is an invariable rule of all laws, that all parts &s;hould be con&s;trued &s;o as to &s;tand and no part peri&s;h.</P>
<P>The defendant's con&s;truction is too fine &s;pun to be &s;trong, it breaks a&s;under, by another it is held differ|ent &s;till, it is &s;o various that there ari&s;e three contra|dictory modes, but truth is &s;imple and uniform, there are various accounts, all &s;imple and con&s;i&s;tent, if the&s;e are true, they are all the creatures of fancy; they could not repeal the fir&s;t and &s;econd &s;ections of that Act, and therefore could not provide for the payment&punc; the&s;e are invi&s;ible entities of rea&s;oning, we need a micro&s;cope to aid our intellectual optics to &s;ee them. The A&s;&s;embly could not intend what they could not under&s;tand, where is the law which directs payment? It proves the rever&s;e
<PB N="422" REF="027132_0430_0FD35282E2458770">
of what was intended, this is the rea&s;oning the defend|ant is driven to, if the law proves it, they will avail them&s;elves of it, for my part I can't think it was the intention of the Legi&s;lature, the majority never &s;pun thus finely this creature of metaphy&s;ics by the Act of 1789.</P>
<P>Can a man have an intention to do what he does not under&s;tand? the exchange being optional does not &s;erve the defendant, it conforms to our &s;tatement. The op|tion to re-exchange is no objection to our con&s;truction, <HI>"Many</HI> may be de&s;irous," it is therefore true, that it is optional with the holders, it is therefore con&s;i&s;tent with my explanation, and perfectly con&s;i&s;tent in it&s;elf. Take the whole amount together, it is equity, it is ju&s;tice. We make our option, which is no more than this; come and take your original certificates, we were never bound to pay you in ca&s;h, you may come and take them if you plea&s;e; it was not nece&s;&s;ary to make a law to compel them to take their certificates: It was only this, that if they did not come the obligation on the part of the commonwealth was done away, we are not obliged to pay ca&s;h, we will not pay ca&s;h, we will perform our contract, you may have your certificates, they were never demandable in ca&s;h, they were never a claim for ca&s;h, they were a claim for the original certificates for which they were exchang|ed, they are no claim again&s;t the government.</P>
<P>That &s;ub&s;equent laws called them a claim it is true. They were a claim for certificates, the defendant's ob|ject was to &s;hew a law to ju&s;tify him; but this rea&s;oning proves there is none, the fir&s;t &s;ection did not provide or payment, and the &s;ub&s;equent ones were repealed. That the&s;e New-Loans were contemplated as claims or re|ceipts is undoubtedly true, if we would deny this, we &s;hould commit an outrage again&s;t common &s;en&s;e; this is corroborated by the maxim, that we are not to create a being to be de&s;troyed, they knew &s;uch po&s;itions were not &s;upportable: Much rea&s;oning and paper might have been &s;pared: If our con&s;truction is the right one, they were a claim for the original certificates; one of the
<PB N="423" REF="027132_0431_0FD35285B06A0B00">
Gentlemen &s;ays, that the providing to pay in certificates is a confe&s;&s;ion that they were a claim for ca&s;h; they were a claim, that claim was merely for re-exchange; but not for ca&s;h.</P>
<P>The provi&s;ion for exchange is no acknowledgment of debt. Another rea&s;on mu&s;t meet us very forcibly, that the law of 1789 is void, as being again&s;t the con&s;titu|tion of the United States, and impairing the validity of contracts; it is not &s;o, if our con&s;truction of the law of 1786 is right.</P>
<P>But let us &s;uppo&s;e for a moment (being willing to put it in every po&s;&s;ible point of view) that we are wrong, that it was an engagement at all events to pay ca&s;h, this is taking the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible ground contend|ed for.</P>
<P>I do not mean what is contended for on the other &s;ide, for it appears a little &s;ingular, that the con&s;tituti|on of the United States &s;hould herein impair the obli|gation of contracts. If the Act of 1786 had made an ab&s;olute debt, it's repeal would not be contrary to the con&s;titution, the &s;ection only means that a &s;tate &s;hould not e&s;tabli&s;h iniquity by law.</P>
<P>It was a mere act of favour by the State, or el&s;e it might be under&s;tood that the &s;tate made laws, for car|rying into effect the breach of contracts. Take your New-Loans for the Continental certificates. If it means more than this, it mu&s;t be that the very letter and terms of the contract &s;hould be carried into effect; if &s;o, a State could not e&s;tabli&s;h a chancery juri&s;diction, which &s;ays, penalties &s;hall not always be exacted.</P>
<P>Nor &s;tatutes of limitations, a thou&s;and pounds pay|able on demand, is as ju&s;tly due after four years as before; the four years expire, and the contract is not performed; yet it is a bar pleadable and no inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Let us advert to the &s;tatutes again&s;t u&s;ury, giving damages in&s;tead of compelling a &s;pecific performance, and a contract to pay 12 per cent. if it were not for the law would be a contract; the law &s;ays it &s;hall be no contract. Is this impairing the obligation of con|tract?
<PB N="424" REF="027132_0432_0FD351E0BB5B34A8">
this compels a per&s;on to receive what he did not contract for; are the&s;e again&s;t the con&s;titution of the United States? where ju&s;tice is done the contract is an|&s;wered.</P>
<P>If the con&s;truction of the law mu&s;t be literal, giv|ing damages for &s;pecific articles, &s;uch as to deliver lands in&s;tead of ca&s;h, mu&s;t al&s;o be a breach of contract: the &s;pecific article &s;hould be given, the Act of 1789 now under con&s;ideration, &s;ays take your certificates in&s;tead of ca&s;h; the&s;e ob&s;ervations are all unnece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e they go on the foundation that all New-Loans are pay|able in ca&s;h.</P>
<P>But to give the Gentlemen every thing they want, admit for a moment that we're wrong, this contract is unfair, &s;uppo&s;e it is impaired, another que&s;tion ari&s;es, who is to &s;ay it is impairing the contract, where is the proper judicature? Who is to be the arbiter between the State and her own citizens? This is a &s;erious con|&s;ideration; <HI>Monte&s;que, Locke</HI> and other writers will oppo&s;e them here, the power of making laws is the &s;u|preme power of the State, is there a power &s;uperior to the &s;upreme power? If the judges have this power, it follows that the &s;upreme power is controlled by an in|ferior power. If courts cannot, the Senate cannot, both as a court and a part only of the Legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>This is a very important que&s;tion, there &s;hould be &s;ome important judiciary, it is a complex que&s;tion, the con&s;titution is &s;ilent on the &s;ubject. We mu&s;t arrive at &s;ome period, let us proceed to the end of the chain, another Legi&s;lature to judge the former, another to re|judge the latter, and &s;o on to infinity.</P>
<P>Can the Senate rejudge it, being only one branch? the Legi&s;lature of the State has the &s;upreme power, can any individual enjoy it? &s;hall we leave it to a jury to de|termine? they judge of facts, this is uncertainty, and contradiction, &s;hall every petty officer arraign his ma&s;|ter? &s;hall any man vainly imagine that he is wi&s;er than his repre&s;entatives? language of this kind hath been held,
<PB N="425" REF="027132_0433_0FD352873A06C450">
nay, hath been prati&s;ed. This is ri&s;ing again&s;t the or|ganization of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>If he decided wrong, he decided at his peril; here it is contended is the check, the judiciary are to judge; but this brings us back again, the judiciary in that in|&s;tance would &s;it above the Legi&s;lature, the people only are &s;uperior to the Legi&s;lature, the Legi&s;lature is amen|able in their repre&s;entative capacity to the people, but &s;hall a jury judge? Do juries repre&s;ent the common|wealth? They are not the Repre&s;entatives of the peo|ple, their office is to judge of facts and evidence, not to judge of the con&s;titutionality of laws. If they are to be the ultimate criterion, it is void to day, becau&s;e a jury &s;aid &s;o, it will be in force to-morrow, if a jury &s;hall &s;ay &s;o.</P>
<P>There is a &s;ufficient check on the Repre&s;entatives, it is this, they are amenable to their con&s;tituents, their &s;e&s;&s;ions being only temporary, their doings may be re|pealed until then it is a law; they may repeal a law orderly by &s;ub&s;equent repre&s;entations&mdash;No power on earth can exi&s;t &s;uperior to the Legi&s;lature of the State, except what exi&s;ts in the People, it does not exi&s;t in the Judiciary, not in the Senate, nor in Juries. They will, if they di&s;approve, choo&s;e others who will repeal obnoxious laws. If they mi&s;-judge, they are corrupt; they will again choo&s;e others; the power is le&s;s danger|ous here, if they refu&s;e, the People may recur to their original &s;tate, di&s;&s;olve the &s;ocial compact, untie the knot, and redre&s;s every mi&s;take. Here is an evil but a le&s;s one; this free agency in man, this torpid debi|lity, this <HI>"vis inertiae;"</HI> the former is the fever, the latter the death of patrioti&s;m.</P>
<P>I have been the more particular in this in&s;tance, as there are two important points to be con&s;idered, that if the&s;e certificates were not &s;ub&s;cribable, they were not redeemable, although the rever&s;e of the po&s;ition is not true; if the &s;ervant is to judge of what his ma&s;ter does, then the defendant is to adjudicate between the State and the holders, there is no &s;ituation &s;o unfit at his to
<PB N="426" REF="027132_0434_0FD351E2439F8550">
decide; the Comptroller a&s;&s;umes a right to adjudicate, he buys up all the New-Loans, places him&s;elf in the &s;hoes of one of the parties, and then determines he is to be paid; this is the ground on which this judge &s;tood on this que&s;tion between the State and the Peo|ple.</P>
<P>But &s;till di&s;po&s;ed to &s;uppo&s;e every thing credible; let them &s;uppo&s;e us &s;till wrong; there are yet ample grounds for the conviction of the defendant, if they &s;till exi&s;ted in the form of debts, they were not &s;ub&s;cribable debts and payable in ca&s;h, it was &s;aid that the&s;e were, by virtue of the Act of Congre&s;s, &s;ub&s;cribable; &s;ituated as the&s;e certificates were, it was out of the power of Congre&s;s to take them, and to charge <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> with their amount in adju&s;ting the &s;ettlement between the United and Individual States: The provi&s;ion was only for &s;uch as the State acknowledged to be debts payable in ca&s;h.</P>
<P>They were only acknowledgments of debt. The Secretary of the Trea&s;ury &s;o under&s;tood them, we will go on broader ground than this, and &s;ay, if they in|tended to pay &s;uch, it would be completely out of their power. The State held the Continental certificates; Congre&s;s could not &s;ay, we will not pay the State, but pay the holders of New-Loans. The Act of 1789 de|clares the di&s;&s;ent of the State.</P>
<P>It is true <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> owes <HI>A.</HI> becau&s;e he holds New-Loan certificates, and the Union owes <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> becau&s;e &s;he holds original certificates. It will not be contended that Congre&s;s de&s;igned to pay both; then could Congre&s;s pay the holders of New-Loan certifi|cates without the con&s;ent of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and pay the State too?</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;cribing New-Loans implies they were not to be exchanged, and makes the State a creditor by vir|tue of having the Continental, without the con&s;ent of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> Congre&s;s could not a&s;&s;ume the New-Loans and refu&s;e the payment of the Continental.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s mu&s;t previou&s;ly authori&s;e a power to deter|mine the New-Loans to be a debt, before they could
<PB N="427" REF="027132_0435_0FD351E458DB1538">
a&s;&s;ume them. This would amount, to decide a ca&s;e between a State and her own citizens.</P>
<P>The Supreme Court refu&s;ed to decide it. The Se|cretary of the Trea&s;ury never would decide this, if it was to be decided by its nature, none are competent but the people, who might recur to original principles.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s could therefore make no &s;uch provi&s;ion, if this is true, the New-Loan certificates were not &s;ub|&s;cribable to the loan of the United States.</P>
<P>Thus, I have been willing to de&s;cend, &s;tep by &s;tep, from that ground on which the pro&s;ecution re&s;ted, to prove the charge again&s;t the Comp. Gen. is well found|ed, and his defence not maintainable. I will de&s;cend one &s;tep lower, and admit that the New-Loans are a&s;|&s;umable, yet the defendant is guilty in the true &s;en&s;e of the articles of impeachment, and upon every principle of ju&s;tice, although no gentleman will agree that Con|gre&s;s, the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, or any other per|&s;on had a right to decide on their a&s;&s;umability.</P>
<P>It was the intere&s;t of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> that the Act of 1789 &s;hould be complied with. They viewed them|&s;elves bound to pay 20<HI>&s;.</HI> in the pound. This bu&s;ine&s;s was committed to the Comptroller-General, and he had the care of making the bargain. Is it ju&s;t in him to take mea&s;ures to defeat this tru&s;t? It was his bu&s;ine&s;s to promote it; he oppo&s;ed it.</P>
<P>Has he not taken every dollar from the Trea&s;ury, which he has put into his pocket, and this after the bar|gain was completed? She committed the management of this tran&s;action to her agent, the holders of New-Loans were to apply to him for re-exchanges, he was the agent, nay, call it more, the commonwealth made the offer, and appointed Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> to com|pleat the re-exchange. Is this faithfulne&s;s in an agent? Did he fulfil his tru&s;t? Does not this look like perfidy? Did he take pains to procure exchanges? When per|&s;ons offered to exchange and &s;urrender, did he not pre|vent that exchange? Did he not after they were lodged in his hand as agent, and Comptroller-General, pur|cha&s;e
<PB N="428" REF="027132_0436_0FD3528C9C7074E0">
and put them as Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> into his poc|ket? And if they had been &s;o exchanged, could they have been redeemed? After the parties had agreed to take the offer of the State from this officer entru&s;ted to make &s;uch bargain, and by which the State would gain the difference in the exchange; he clearly had no equity to put this difference into his own pocket. After the parties had con&s;ented to carry the exchange into effect, he refu&s;ed to deliver the Continental certificates, he &s;ent a line offering to take and buy them him&s;elf; nay, he actually purcha&s;ed them, after which he &s;ub&s;cribed them to the loan of the United States, and procured their redemption at the State-Trea&s;ury; &s;o that all con&s;truc|tion is out of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I a&s;k, if guilt is not irre&s;i&s;tably proved on Mr. <HI>Ni|chol&s;on?</HI> Perhaps much le&s;s than this would be crimi|nal. Whenever a per&s;on was willing to &s;ell a certificate, every &s;uch per&s;on willing to exchange his property, but was prevented by Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> even in the &s;treets, by which exchange it would be the property of the State, but had been not only put into the pocket of the Comptroller, but taken out of the Trea&s;ury of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI></P>
<P>It is a little &s;ingular that the ground on which the defendant re&s;ts his defence, is by doing equity in op|po&s;ition to law, and being anxious to defeat the views of the Legi&s;lature, that equity &s;hould be done to the holders of New-Loans, by procuring for them 20&shilling;. per pound; in&s;tead of this equity, we find Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> cho&s;e to make a bargain, and to take this equity from them, and the means of doing it in like manner is wre&s;ted from them, le&s;t the State &s;hould take it. This is cru&s;hing equity to death; this aggravates the charges, to deprive them of 20&shilling;. in the pound, law or no law. If Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> knew it, it was unju&s;t, he defrauded the State or the party; where he took this equity from the State, he defrauded the public, when from the holders he defrauded the holders. Where then is this equity?</P>

<P>Mr. DEXTER,</P>
<P>Ro&s;e and &s;aid,</P>
<P>I endeavoured in the forenoon to prove my fir&s;t po&s;i|tion, that <HI>the Comptroller-General cau&s;ed New-Loans to be &s;ub&s;cribed, which were not &s;ub&s;cribable by law.</HI></P>
<P>The Act of March 1789 &s;hews the Legi&s;lature did not mean to unfund the debt, as the principal never was provided for, therefore it was unnece&s;&s;ary to repeal what never was enacted.</P>
<P>It is contended by the coun&s;el for the defendant that the intere&s;t only on the New-Loans was attended to, and con&s;idered. If the intere&s;t was only to be paid, why introduce the word <HI>principal,</HI> which was never funded at all? We will now attend to our &s;econd di|vi&s;ion, which is, <HI>That he cau&s;ed New-Loans to be re|deemed, when by law they were not redeemable, and thereby had broken and violated the Con&s;titution of this common|wealth.</HI></P>
<P>That he cau&s;ed New-Loans to be redeemed, that he certified them to be &s;o, and that that certificate was gi|ven, officially, will not be controverted. That this fi&s;|cal arrangement by his certifications, had the effect of
<PB N="431" REF="027132_0439_0FD3529358838728">
drawing the money out of the Trea&s;ury of <HI>Penn&s;ylva|nia,</HI> will not be denied.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion is, Whether there was, or was not a law:</P>
<P>The Act of the 10th April 1792, is much relied on, to ju&s;tify him. (Here Mr. <HI>Dexter</HI> read a part of that Act.</P>
<P>It is agreed that the &s;econd &s;ection is not exten&s;ive enough to cover New-Loans, and for the payment, re|demption and di&s;charge of all the certificates of that de|&s;cription.</P>
<P>It is agreed that intere&s;t is not payable on New-Loans, as it is conceded that this expre&s;&s;ion does not cover New-Loans, and as no intere&s;t was payable on them, it is contended that in a part of the 6th &s;ection they are included, a&s;&s;uming the New-Loans as &s;ub&s;cribable, New-Loans are not mentioned, and yet they are &s;ub|&s;cribable, and if &s;ub&s;cribable, they mu&s;t be redeemable, becau&s;e &s;ub&s;cribable certificates are to be paid; but all the &s;tate and continental officers agree they are not &s;ub|&s;cribable, and con&s;equently not redeemable. (He then read the 6th &s;ection). "The holder of a certificate or certificates, <HI>&s;ub&s;cribable</HI> to the &s;ub&s;cription," &amp;c. If they are not &s;ub&s;cribable, it cannot be within the purview of this act, it is well under&s;tood from the complexion of the law, that whatever is not &s;ub&s;cribable cannot be re|deemable, and whatever is not &s;ub&s;cribable nor redeem|able, cannot be included in this &s;ection. Whatever might have once been the opinion of the Comptroller-General, it is evident it never was the opinion of the law officers of the &s;tate of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> nor of the Attor|ney-General of the United States. (Here Mr. <HI>Dexter</HI> wanted to lay his hands on the letter of Mr. <HI>Randolph,</HI> page 81-2, but could not find it) and he added, We need not recur to the unanimous opinion of the officers, the laws are here, the Senate under&s;tand them, and will judge; that paper ought to have been here; if the cer|tificates are not redeemable, then all the rea&s;oning of the gentlemen will fall to the ground, becau&s;e they are not &s;ub&s;cribable to the loan opened by Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Admit that the New-Loans were &s;ub&s;cribable, &s;till
<PB N="432" REF="027132_0440_0FD3529526879A08">
they are not redeemable. The gentleman who opened the defence, agreed that the fund had not been provid|ed for the redemption of New-Loans by the 6th &s;ection, but by the 2d. (Mr. <HI>Tilghman</HI> ob&s;erved, The gentle|man did not attend to my &s;tatement. The &s;ixth &s;ection is more exten&s;ive than the &s;econd. The fund by the &s;ale of 3 per cent. &s;tock, was not to cover New-Loans.)</P>
<P>Taking this to be true, the object of the defend|ant is not obtained, and it is clear no New-Loans are redeemable; but recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to ano|ther fund, nay, the fund for claims and improvements they &s;ay, covers it; the defendant's warrant and certi|ficate, prove the contrary; the&s;e are raw troops pre&s;&s;ed into his &s;ervice; this is a &s;trange departure of the Compt|roller-General's plan of defence; his coun&s;el &s;hift their ground. The Comptroller-General committed the fact, and retained coun&s;el to find other laws for it, but tho&s;e laws are confe&s;&s;ed to be of no u&s;e. It is &s;aid New-Loan certificates were a debt by the Act of 1786. Could the Act of 1792 make them more than a debt? But the Comptroller being determined to get a fund to draw his money from, and finding he could not &s;ucceed in drawing his ca&s;h by virtue of that law of 1792, chang|ed his opinion, and his coun&s;el procured him another fund. (Here Mr. <HI>Dexter</HI> &s;aid, If I am not right, they will put me right. Mr. <HI>Lewis</HI> &s;aid, <HI>You're wrong this long time, but go on.)</HI> The funds for claims and im|provements &s;hould be made u&s;e of; this was done by the Act of 1791. This is too remote for di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, fixed by its hi&s;tory rai&s;ed per Act of 1789, and limited to &pound;. 10,000 for claims and improvements. <HI>(Here Mr. Bradford interrupted Mr. Dexter, and &s;aid, The Act of April 7th, 1791, created the fund, and did not limit it.)</HI> This fund without any particular appropriation only to provide for claims and improvements, and without any provi&s;ion for minute occa&s;ions or any occurrence which may happen during the rece&s;s of the Legi&s;lature; why is this called up? it is a confe&s;&s;ion of di&s;tru&s;t, it is peeping out of the window.</P>
<P><PB N="433" REF="027132_0441_0FD3529684276A60">Let us take the u&s;ele&s;s Act of 1792 out of the que&s;|tion; the Act of 1786 and 1791 are &s;ufficient for the defendant.</P>
<P>The New-Loans are &s;aid to be a claim, therefore it is &s;aid to be within the act of 7th April 1791, are not un|funded depreciated debt equally within it? There are no debts but are claims, if they exi&s;ted at the time of creating the fund, they are all included in the fund for claims and improvements. The&s;e were for objects too various and minute for legi&s;lation: this tran&s;action mu&s;t be uncon&s;titutional; if thus general, why not a little zeal in the defendant? By the law of 1789 the defendant ac|quired wealth, and gained money.</P>
<P>It is argued that the act of 1789, &s;topped intere&s;t on New-Loans, notwith&s;tanding, by this means the Compt|roller-General got intere&s;t. The gentlemen will not contend, that New-Loans are one of the objects.</P>
<P>When any money was drawn out of the Trea&s;ury, the fund was particularly mentioned, that &s;uch a warrant or claim was payable out of &s;uch or &s;uch a fund; therefore it e&s;pecially behoves the defendant to &s;hew out of what fund, the money was to be drawn to &s;atisfie his de|mand. This act goes to &s;hew what &s;hall be paid out of the claim found by the act of April 7th 1791. This ge|neral clau&s;e covers all warrants hereafter to be drawn by virtue of any law or laws, &amp;c. Was this a claim pro|vided for? It is clear there was no appropriation; con&s;equently the Con&s;titution was broken. This &s;weep|ing clau&s;e (6th &s;ection) cannot cover &s;o important a de|mand: By the law of 1786, the New-Loans are a debt in &s;ome &s;hape or other; by the law of 1789, they were made no longer payable in ca&s;h, it was agreed <HI>that the intere&s;t was not to be paid in ca&s;h;</HI> the principal was ne|ver funded. This is a blind general clau&s;e, altogether incapable of altering the conditions of the New-Loans.</P>
<P>That the principal and intere&s;t of the New-Loans &s;hould be paid, but &s;till I mi&s;under&s;tand them&punc; or they are mi&s;taken, in &s;aying that the Act of 1786 created a debt. The intere&s;t is not funded by the law of 1789.
<PB N="434" REF="027132_0442_0FD35216D3F7BD78">
If an appropriation to pay by the law of 1789, why in|troduce it by the Act of 1792? If the Act of April 1791 provides for it, and a fund competent for its di&s;|charge, why is the Act of 1792 &s;ought for to make it more than a debt? This is calling in a law, which gives it no additional &s;trength, their own con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s be|trays their faithfulne&s;s to their client, they are convinced that their proof is not &s;ufficient to &s;upport them; this is manife&s;t, though not expre&s;&s;ed by them, it would be prudent in them to clo&s;e the door of &s;ecrecy on this di&s;tru&s;t. Nothing can be done by the law of 1792 if they are right in their con&s;truction of the Acts of 1786 or 1789.</P>
<P>It will not be contended that the Act of 1792 made the New-Loans a debt. If the law of 1792 is u&s;ele&s;s, take it out of the que&s;tion; having taken it out, you apply for payment by the law of 1791.</P>
<P>If right in this rea&s;oning, it will be admitted there was no fund, and con&s;equently no appropriation; and therefore the &s;econd charge is fully proved, and the Con&s;titution of the commonwealth was broken by the Comptroller-General.</P>
<P>That there was an appropriation by the law of 1792, for the redemption of debts, is evident from the &s;econd &s;ection. What is the Comptroller-General's language? He &s;ays, although the Legi&s;lature &s;ay by the Act of 1789 that the&s;e certificates are no debts, yet he &s;ays, <HI>A. B. C.</HI> are creditors of the commonwealth by the Act of 1792. I know the &s;tate owes the&s;e people, I will determine, I will take the money, I will pay it to the holders of New-Loans, I will go further, I will pur|cha&s;e this equitable claim my&s;elf, having the power, although the agent of the government, I will purcha&s;e it from the holders by virtue of my official authority, and retain the money by virtue of the Act of 1792.</P>
<P>Is this the language of a faithful agent? On what principles of equity is this ju&s;tified? Is this ju&s;tice to the New-Loan holders? I will no longer detain you on this &s;econd divi&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="435" REF="027132_0443_0FD35219257E2500">I am now come to the third general que&s;tion, that is, <HI>Has he not appropriated to his own u&s;e, New-Loan cer|tificates which had been &s;urrendered to the commonwealth by the holders; and &s;hould have been cancelled?</HI></P>
<P>That the Comptroller-General, as tru&s;tee of the commonwealth, had done this, will not be doubted; our evidence however on this point is not now as com|pleat as it may be, we expect the te&s;timony of <HI>Hans Hamilton;</HI> but there are other evidences, <HI>Biddle</HI> and <HI>Oldden,</HI> by who&s;e te&s;timony the &s;ame imputation is fixed on the conduct of the Comptroller-General.</P>
<P>The te&s;timony of both are &s;imilar, both applied to Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> to exchange, both brought the New-Loan certificates to be exchanged, one of them filled up a blank exchange, they manife&s;ted their con&s;ent to re-exchange, no expectation ever to receive back their New-Loans again, this is a &s;trong evidence of their intention to re-exchange, the&s;e were by all principles of ju&s;tice &s;urrendered to the commonwealth, and ought to have been cancelled; the property was &s;hifted from the holders to the State, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of be|ing de&s;troyed, if he &s;hould have delivered the certificates to the original holders, it would be perfidy in the agent.</P>
<P>We are told with confidence, that "the charge is a mill-&s;tone, the evidence as light as a feather." They are much mi&s;taken in the merits of this controver&s;y; the property was not in the original holders as &s;oon as the proprietor reached it to the agent of the common|wealth, the &s;ame was completely &s;hifted from the ori|ginal holders, not a doubt can remain of their being liable for the holder's debts.</P>
<P>It will not be contended that if two parties agree to exchange commodities, and they agree on all the terms, the bargain is completed. One &s;ays, here, take my goods, I will call to-morrow and receive my articles. The property is &s;hifted. If the&s;e general principles are e&s;tabli&s;hed and admitted, if the ca&s;e before the Se|nate be an exception to &s;uch general principles, it be|comes their duty to &s;hew it. This is not a bold a&s;&s;er|tion,
<PB N="436" REF="027132_0444_0FD35297D0D7BCB0">
but authority which is acquie&s;ced in; the agent was ready, the holder was ready, the party brought the certificates to the agent, the exchange was propo&s;ed to the Comptroller, the agent had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, it was in the cu&s;tody of the commonwealth, an expre&s;s agreement, "give me the original certificates"&mdash;nay, more, the exchange is made in writing. I will call to-morrow or when you can look up the original certificates. If this was not a contract for New-Loan certificates, the government had no original right to i&s;&s;ue them.</P>
<P>The holder had a claim on the State for the amount of his certificates, and no dealer in the market would doubt, but he had parted with his property.</P>
<P>What right, then, had the Comptroller General to make propo&s;als for certificates thus depo&s;ited and di&s;|po&s;ed of; and to appropriate them to his own u&s;e? The fact is, there was delay. The Senate will judge of the intention of the officer by the application: The certificates being thus depo&s;ited, the bargain was com|pleted; he purcha&s;ed them from men who held the property, not the property of Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> but the property of the &s;tate of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania;</HI> and to give a rea&s;on why he did &s;o, he produces neither rea&s;on nor authority for his acting in this manner.</P>
<P>But there is another ca&s;e &s;till &s;tronger than that of <HI>Oldden's</HI> or <HI>Biddle's;</HI> and that is the certificate of <HI>Blair M'Clenachan.</HI></P>
<P>It is true the matter is not per&s;picuous enough, but it is true enough to &s;atisfy certain facts, to wit:</P>
<P>It appears <HI>Blair M'Clenachan</HI> held &s;uch a certificate, he never &s;old to Mr. <HI>John Nichol&s;on</HI> it is true, he &s;old to others; 'tis al&s;o true, and po&s;&s;ible, Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> might have bought from others; if a fact, it is capable of proof&mdash;and the weight of that proof re&s;ts on the Comptroller-General.</P>
<P>It is incumbent on him to &s;hew how he came by it; he has &s;ub&s;cribed it, it is his duty to point out how he became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, we have paid it, it is &s;imilar to &s;tolen good&s; found on a per&s;on, he mu&s;t account how
<PB N="437" REF="027132_0445_0FD351E6523EC6C0">
he came by them; this may be &s;aid to be le&s;s hard on Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> than on a felon, or on a common vaga|bond, who knows nothing of accounts; this is not the ca&s;e with Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> he is a per&s;on of information, of books, and of accounts, knows with whom he deals, and keeps a diary to a&s;&s;i&s;t his memory. <HI>(Mr. Lewis gave him here a loud hoar&s;e laugh, for talkin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; of diaries, when none of them would be admitted as te&s;timony.)</HI> Why! he &s;ays &s;o&mdash;he began to keep a diary in March 1792.</P>
<P>It is a fact that he had this certificate, the amount of which is &pound;.3275:19:4, he can trace a tran&s;action of &s;o much importance, the name cannot be lo&s;t in the mere hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s, if the per&s;on exi&s;ts upon earth, Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> can and ought to produce him; in &s;ome in&s;tances it is u&s;ual to give a bill of &s;ale of &s;uch certificates.</P>
<P>And further, Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of books and official documents, if it is not exchanged, where are the Continental certificates for which this was i&s;&s;ued.</P>
<P>Can the defendant &s;hew them? Let him turn to his books and &s;hew them; will not the books be &s;ufficient to clear up this point? and to &s;hew the amount on hand and not delivered out, or how he has accounted for them, if the books are kept as they ought to have been, it mu&s;t appear from &s;ome of tho&s;e official docu|ments in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the defendant, if no other an&s;wer can be procured, but that he is not bound to prove it, it is in vain to make any enquiry into the conduct of a public officer.</P>
<P>If the certificate had been con&s;olidated <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was con&s;olidated. See Mr. <HI>M'Connell's</HI> evidence, page 186.</NOTE>, &s;till it is in his power to &s;hew this by his books <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The books al&s;o &s;hewed it to have been the ca&s;e.</NOTE>. Finally, if we are to prove the charge, what other evidence can we produce, or can be expected of us? We have proved the facts, the defendant mu&s;t prove his mi&s;take. It is his duty to &s;hew, when and where he purcha&s;ed it, and what became of the counter parts: But if he does not, the charge is proved upon him, and the evidence is &s;trong and irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P><PB N="438" REF="027132_0446_0FD3529A79391028">I am now come to the fourth general que&s;tion, to wit: <HI>Has not the Comptroller-General done all this, know|ingly and corruptly, to make unju&s;t gain, betraying the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him, and traded on the public confidence?</HI></P>
<P>Having proved the facts which were breaches of laws, it is incumbent on the defendant to prove he is innocent, that it was done through mi&s;take and inno|cently, that he acted with an hone&s;t intention, and that this <HI>killing</HI> was not maliciou&s;ly done; if the Compt|roller will not prove this, there is no doubt of his know|ledge and criminal intentions. Can any doubts exi&s;t of what a man tells us in the public records, after the la|bour of many days, &s;hould he &s;ay that he did not know it?</P>
<P>In the&s;e records he has explicitly &s;hewn the true con|&s;truction of tho&s;e laws, his &s;tatement in 1790 is con|clu&s;ive, (here Mr. <HI>Dexter</HI> read the minutes of 1790, page 389) that the New-Loans amounted to a certain &s;um, which were claims again&s;t the State, but by the Act of 1789 were excluded from redemption. (The whole being taken, it reads, <HI>"redemption" by the Land-office.)</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e claims were only claims for certificates (page 395, &s;ame date) by the Act of March 178 they were excluded from the Land-office, in the &s;ame page are mo&s;t material pa&s;&s;ages, but for what purpo&s;e? They were claims not for money at as early a date as Decem|ber 1790. I have urged this confe&s;&s;ion as a rea&s;on, and a number of circum&s;tances &s;trongly apply to confirm that this was the true con&s;truction, that the Comptrol|ler-General and the other officers of government con|curred in the &s;ame opinion, that New-Loan certificates were not &s;ub&s;cribable to the loan of the United States.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury was of that opinion, when he was better informed, he renounced his former opinion. The con&s;ideration of the two Acts of 1786 and 1789, together with the con&s;ideration of the Con&s;titution of the United States, never came be|fore him for deci&s;ion in a <HI>"prominent point of view."</HI></P>
<P>The Comptroller-General was not mi&s;taken in his
<PB N="439" REF="027132_0447_0FD3529D035AF2A0">
views. Is he to &s;helter him&s;elf under the opinion of the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury? After his partial infor|mation to that officer, the Act of 1786 had been &s;ub|mitted by him to <HI>Hamilton,</HI> the Act of 1789 had been retained, he knew it, and &s;tated in his reports the debt as a claim again&s;t <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> as they operated in the way.</P>
<P>Here is an important que&s;tion, the Comptroller &s;e|crets the Act of 1789, is this opinion a proof of inno|cent intentions? it proves the rever&s;e.</P>
<P>The Regi&s;ter-General never knew that any New-Loans were &s;ub&s;cribed, until Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> had got his money; he went to Mr. <HI>Smith's</HI> office in a &s;urpri&s;e, a circum&s;tance &s;o <HI>&s;ingular,</HI> to know whether it was true or not.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o true, that the Comptroller-General did not know what was the opinion of the Regi&s;ter-General; a conver&s;ation took place, &s;ame time went to <HI>Smith's</HI> office. The Regi&s;ter gives his rea&s;ons, namely, be|cau&s;e he thought it would be to the intere&s;t of the State. Therefore he gave it in the integrity of his heart.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> and &s;ome other re&s;pectable gentlemen are named, as having &s;ub&s;cribed New-Loans. I doubt this to be evidence in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. Was not the opinion of Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> founded on the opinion of the Comptroller-General? Did not the Comptroller broach it? Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> &s;uffered others to act to keep him&s;elf in countenance. Is that opinion &s;ufficient excu&s;e? Had it ever been the &s;ame before? No, until the Comptrol|ler rendered it fa&s;hionable, there is no evidence of any per&s;on entertaining &s;uch an opinion before the Compt|roller-General, who &s;hould have &s;aved to the State the wealth that he is now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. This opinion would never have been thought of if the Comptroller had not broached it. All the holders would have re-exchanged their certificates if he had not defeated the views of the Legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, others determined to purcha&s;e New-Loans before Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on.</HI> The opinion of Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> form|ed
<PB N="440" REF="027132_0448_0FD3529E85E6E510">
them; &s;ome determined before, others determined af|ter. Where is the public officer who has not determined the rever&s;e? They ought to be convinced, as they had been when they had the &s;ame opportunity.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid the defendant had long before the Act of 1792 the &s;ame opinion; it is a mi&s;take, his report made in 1790 clearly proves the contrary, he conceived the de&s;ign that the New-Loans were a claim, not a claim for certificates, but a claim for ca&s;h.</P>
<P>His oppo&s;ition to the law of 1792 has been much relied on, much credit hath been taken for the &s;ecret &s;ources of wealth contained in his plan of finance from pure and di&s;intere&s;ted motives. Why did he oppo&s;e it? Does it prove his innocence? The Comptroller oppo&s;|ed it; becau&s;e it would &s;ubject the State to the payment of &s;ome debts, which the commonwealth ought not to pay. Does not this &s;hew a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s? Does not this prove that he knew New-Loans were not redeem|able either legally or equitably.</P>
<P>It &s;hews covetou&s;ne&s;s; to &s;uffer them to be re-ex|changed might include an imprudent proceeding. Was he not bound to take no advantage of their impru|dence? And he was not bound to uncover their naked|ne&s;s. This he thought right, and puts the difference into his own pocket; all this under the colour of law. By the&s;e principles he took the advantage of the hold|ers with an ill grace. All this is a plan proof of con|viction, converting every thing to his private gain. It is po&s;&s;ible, nay, it is probable that he conceived the de&s;ign of oppo&s;ing the Act of 10th April 1792, from pure motives, for what rea&s;on? We &s;ay they were afterwards corrupt. There are other parts of the evi|dence which demon&s;trate the guilt of the defendant.</P>
<P>The &s;tatement of the Comptroller, that New-Loans were excluded in the provi&s;ions for claims and improve|ment, is a proof in point; it cannot be pretended that they are in the law of 1792, it is confe&s;&s;ed not to be in the &s;econd &s;ection, it is &s;aid to be in the &s;ixth. Pure motives the&s;e! When this officer wanted an engine be|cau&s;e
<PB N="441" REF="027132_0449_0FD352A10913A778">
the word "&s;ub&s;cribable" can be found in that &s;ection.</P>
<P>The complete &s;ecrecy is a &s;trong proof of his guilt, bound to communicate with the other officers, which he declined until he actually obtained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the money. If the opinion of the Comptroller was known for &s;o many years, why &s;ecrecy &s;o many years? He did not receive money to pay it back again, he carried his plan into execution before the Governor, a faithful of|ficer took mea&s;ures to &s;top it, the Regi&s;ter was check|ed in the progre&s;s. This is the conduct of Mr. <HI>Nichol|&s;on.</HI> This is the meaning of the articles. On all that came before the Hou&s;e, I do not &s;ee a clau&s;e by which I can be able to find tho&s;e &s;igns of innocency, he was the officer of the public, he was paid for his &s;ervices, he was not to &s;acrifice their intere&s;t to his own private gain; his whole cour&s;e is a &s;acrifice of duty to gain: he pur|&s;ued it with a &s;tep as &s;teady as time. We have &s;een the conduct, we have traced the motives of the Comptrol|ler-General; let us take an exten&s;ive view, let us com|pare them with the general principles of faithfulne&s;s and honour. As an Executive officer, he was an hand to fulfil the volitions of the public, the Legi&s;lature's will was his duty. If we find him going forward in other principles of gain, they are ba&s;e. Is this faithfulne&s;s, fairne&s;s and honour, in a country like ours, where the government lives on public confidence? They are &s;ha|ken by every breath, if they are not equipoi&s;ed, the nice balance is ea&s;ily di&s;placed. By this means the cor|ruptions of European politics will de&s;troy our con&s;ti|tution, and fal&s;e con&s;tructions will overwhelm our own politics, and &s;acrifice the principles on which we built our Republic.</P>
<P>Of all the parts the public revenue ought to be mo&s;t clo&s;ely watched; revenue is food which in a di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate is humour and di&s;ea&s;e, and becomes the food of corruption. No jealou&s;y is too great to check un|bounded power; no jealou&s;y too great to watch un|limited
<PB N="442" REF="027132_0450_0FD35252B78EBB88">
confidence, in equal &s;y&s;tems purity and &s;everity are nece&s;&s;ary,</P>
<P>We have been told that great patriots have been &s;a|crificed to popular fury, through clamour and preju|dice. Is this an argument again&s;t convicting the de|fendant! Where is the clamour, where is the public re&s;entment? The influence of the re&s;pondent is great, more danger of impunity, he has many friends. No compari&s;on between the Republics of antient times and our own, the repre&s;entation here is judicious, their laws were indefinite; no more &s;imilarity between <HI>Ame|rica</HI> and <HI>Greece,</HI> than there is between their patriots and the re&s;pondent. They knew nothing of repre&s;entati|ons, they knew nothing of the divi&s;ions of power, they did not decide by fixed laws, pa&s;&s;ion was their only principle.</P>
<P>Hence an unju&s;t acquittal is perfidy to the public. I know the Senate have too much under&s;tanding to leave their po&s;t; the proof is competent to authori&s;e a ple|nary conviction; if the opinion of the Senate &s;hould be different, the Comptroller will not be puni&s;hed for mal-conduct, the community will be defrauded, the day of acquittal will be forgotten, it will be e&s;tabli&s;h|ing a reward for crimes, in future no re&s;pon&s;ibility will be expected, this will be opening the flood-gates of corruption; but con&s;ider, they ought to know that you are above them; they will then do ju&s;tice, as it is ex|pected the Senate will in this ca&s;e do ju&s;tice to the commonwealth of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> and to the re&s;pondent, and prevent the torrent of &s;eduction from &s;weeping away our liberties and our rights.

<P>I appear for an officer who has been long in the pub|lic &s;ervice, and, I may add, long a public favorite:&mdash; an officer who has been as it were burdened with the public confidence and oppre&s;&s;ed with duties numerous, delicate and difficult in their execution. When &s;uch an officer is <HI>accu&s;ed,</HI> the very confidence with which he has been honored begets &s;u&s;picion; and if he be accu&s;ed of <HI>peculation,</HI> a jealou&s;y for the people's rights provokes a peculiar zeal in tho&s;e who con|duct the pro&s;ecution.

Their committee, in their inve&s;tigation of his conduct, left no tract unexplored&mdash;no office un&s;earched&mdash;no expence &s;pared: and yet, although the defendant has been twelve years in office, they have been able to bring forward only a &s;ingle charge of <HI>this kind:</HI> and that founded on the &s;ingle te&s;timony of an unrecollecting individual.</P>
<P><PB N="445" REF="027132_0453_0FD352A301D9D4C8">Impre&s;&s;ed with the importance of the cau&s;e I will endeavour to di&s;cu&s;s it as well as my &s;trength will per|mit: and in order to follow &s;ome method, the articles of impeachment &s;hall be my guide. They will be &s;e|perately con&s;idered and probably &s;eperately decided on by you: and therefore a di&s;tinct and &s;eperate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of them is in &s;ome degree nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t article may be divided into three di&s;tinct po&s;itions,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That the Act of March 1789, rendered the New-Loan certificates no longer a debt or evidence of a debt.</P>
<P N="2">2d. That he declared the&s;e certificates to be &s;ub|&s;cribable to the loan of the United States.</P>
<P N="3">3d. That this was a mi&s;demeanor, in violation of his duty.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e po&s;itions, is the ba&s;is of the whole pro&s;ecution. It therefore de&s;erves a minute examinati|on: for unle&s;s it can be &s;upported, the Colo&s;&s;us which is reared upon it mu&s;t inevitably fall.&mdash;Its importance ari&s;es from the Act of Congre&s;s of the 4th of Augu&s;t 1790, which makes the &s;ums &s;ub&s;cribable to the loan, payable in certificates i&s;&s;ued by the re&s;pective &s;tates "as acknowledgements or evidences of debts by them re|&s;pectively owing."</P>
<P>That the New-Loan certificates were at <HI>one time</HI> evi|dences of a debt owing by <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> &s;eemed &s;o manife&s;t that it could not be denied; and accordingly the committee thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate, that the Act of 1789 had de&s;troyed that quality. They there|fore placed this po&s;ition in the front of the battle: It is our duty to encounter it; and in &s;o doing I will endea|vour to prove,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That the&s;e certificates were debts of <HI>Penn&s;ylva|nia</HI> before the Act of March 1789.</P>
<P N="2">2d. That the Act of that date neither <HI>did</HI> nor <HI>could</HI> annihilate the debt.&mdash;</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e is a principle conceded in the ar|ticles of impeachment. When they &s;tate that the Act
<PB N="446" REF="027132_0454_0FD352A825E848E0">
rendered the&s;e certificates <HI>no longer</HI> a debt, they impli|citly admit that they <HI>were</HI> a debt before the Act was pa&s;&s;ed. The learned managers, al&s;o, have occa&s;ionly admitted it; but as their coun&s;el have told us that it was not a debt&mdash;but a temporary exchange of certifi|cates&mdash;that they were not ab&s;olute contracts for the payment of money&mdash;but mere receipts to enable the holder to get back his Continental certificates&mdash;it has become nece&s;&s;ary to examine this point.</P>
<P>By a debt every lawyer under&s;tands <HI>ex vi termeni,</HI> a &s;um of money due by certain and expre&s;s contract. Such we hold the&s;e certificates to be:&mdash;a debt created by the Act of March 1786.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of that Act hath been gone into to prove that this was only an engagement to pay the intere&s;t as long as the &s;tate cho&s;e, and not a permament debt. And it was &s;aid to be a mere temporary provi&s;ion, be|cau&s;e it was originally the debt of the United States and not the proper debt of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI></P>
<P>It will therefore be proper in this place to mention a few facts which illu&s;trate the hi&s;tory of the certificate &mdash;debt of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI></P>
<P>When the war commenced it was under&s;tood and afterwards expres&s;ly &s;tipulated that all expences &s;hould be paid out of a common trea&s;ury. Congre&s;s had no|minally the power of rai&s;ing money but no organ by which they could effectually exert that power. They could make requi&s;itions but could not enforce them: and it has properly been called a government of &s;up|plication.&mdash;Hence they were obliged to i&s;&s;ue paper-mo|ney; but that depreciated and large debts were una|voidably contracted.</P>
<P>The&s;e debts were for &s;ervices rendered, articles fur|ni&s;hed or monies advanced.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Part of this debt aro&s;e from the depreciation of the &s;oldiers pay. Congre&s;s in 1786 determined to make up that depreciation, and not being able to do it them|&s;elves, reque&s;ted the &s;everal &s;tates to compen&s;ate their re&s;pective troops for the deficiency of their pay. Hence
<PB N="447" REF="027132_0455_0FD352AA57AD5B08">
aro&s;e the depreciation debt of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> originally the debt of the United States, and &s;till chargeable in account to them. But as &s;oon as the certificates were i&s;&s;ued by the &s;tate, it became <HI>her own debt</HI> and &s;o it has always been con&s;idered. For the re&s;idue of his de|mands the &s;oldier received the paper of Congre&s;s; and for &s;ervices rendered to the United States, he held in one hand his depreciation certificate i&s;&s;ued by the &s;tate, and in his other a final &s;ettlement certificate granted by Congre&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2d. The &s;econd &s;pecies of certificates were tho&s;e i&s;|&s;ued under the Act of 1&s;t April 1784. The&s;e have of late been called Funded debt&mdash;but the greate&s;t part of them were i&s;&s;ued for militia &s;ervices, when called our by order of Congre&s;s, or for commi&s;&s;ary or quarter|ma&s;ter certificates and other debts properly chargeable to the United States. Here again the &s;tate &s;tepped in to a&s;&s;ume; yet the&s;e certificates are not denied to be the proper debt of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3d. But the greate&s;t part of the public creditors who were citizens of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> held Continental certi|ficates. Neither principal nor intere&s;t was paid upon the&s;e; and though this was not the proper debt of the &s;tate yet &s;he was one of the partner&s;hip, and as far as her quot&punc; went, was bound to contribute. She was willing to do this: but amid&s;t a general delinquency of the &s;tates, &s;he had no encouragement to exert her&s;elf for the payment of any but her own citizens&mdash;and the&s;e &s;he cho&s;e to prefer.</P>
<P>The Legi&s;lature accordingly made Continental cer|tificates receivable in the Land-Office. They went further, and by an Act of 1783 enabled the Loan-offi|cer to pay <HI>one</HI> year's intere&s;t on &s;uch of the Continental certificates as were held by the citizens of the &s;tate. There were hopes, at this time, that Congre&s;s would be authori&s;ed to lay a duty of five per cent. on impo&s;ts: but <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> refu&s;ed to accede to it, and the hopes of a Continental provi&s;ion for the payment of the debt became more di&s;tant. Still <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> was unwil|ling
<PB N="448" REF="027132_0456_0FD351EA5CEA6F70">
to a&s;&s;ume &s;o large a debt as was in the hands of her citizens: But de&s;irous of relieving them, the Le|gi&s;lature directed the &s;tate's quota of the annual inter|e&s;t of the aggregate debt to be paid into the hands of the Continental Loan-officer for the purpo&s;e of paying its own citizens, until <HI>permanent</HI> provi&s;ion &s;hould be made by Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>But this would have left foreign creditors unprovid|ed for: and Congre&s;s by their ordinance of the 27th September 1785, di&s;abled the Loan-officer from car|rying the plan into effect. This defeated the Act of 1785. The indent &s;y&s;tem, propo&s;ed by Congre&s;s, was &s;eem to be delu&s;ive; the creditors &s;uffered; and the moment was arrived when <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> &s;aw &s;he mu&s;t either abandon the relief of her own citizens or take the debt due to them upon her&s;elf. In &s;uch a cri&s;is &s;he did not he&s;itate, but nobly re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ume the debt, to become the creditor of Congre&s;s in&s;tead of the debtor; and by interpo&s;ing her own credit and re|&s;ources, to &s;ave her citizens from di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>This gave birth to the Act of March 1786. The Legi&s;lature determined to open a loan&mdash;to receive the Continental certificates as gold and &s;ilver&mdash;and to give the note of the &s;tate for their amount, payable in ten years.&mdash;In nothing but its amount did this a&s;&s;umption differ from that of the depreciation and other debts of the United States. The different &s;pecies of certificates &s;eemed to be equal favorites: All of them were receiv|able in the Land-office, all of them bore intere&s;t at 6 per cent. and by the Act of 1786 intere&s;t on all of them was made payable half yearly.</P>
<P>In the a&s;&s;umption of the <HI>Depreciation</HI> and <HI>Funded</HI> debt, <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> became entitled to a credit in <HI>ac|count</HI> with Congre&s;s equal to the amount a&s;&s;umed:&mdash; In that of the New-Loan debt &s;he acquired a <HI>transfer|rable</HI> credit: in both ca&s;es &s;he contracted a debt to her own citizens and the certificates i&s;&s;ued were <HI>equally</HI> evi|dences of that debt.&mdash;Why then are we told in &s;uch pointed terms that this was not an original debt of
<PB N="449" REF="027132_0457_0FD3521CE3928D58">
<HI>Penn&s;ylvania?</HI> Is the contract le&s;s valid becau&s;e the con|&s;ideration is a negociable debt, and not ca&s;h or produce? Certainly not. The engagement was thus, "Transfer to me your certificate and I will give you my note to pay you an equivalent in money." If individuals had bar|gained &s;o, what court of law or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">uity would have de|nied that the note thus given created a debt?&mdash;Here the <HI>con&s;ideration</HI> was a valuable one&mdash;the &s;um certain &mdash;the time of payment fixed&mdash;the note negociable. (Mr. <HI>Bradford</HI> then read the form of a New-Loan cer|tificate, &s;ee page 317.) It has the nature and all the properties of a legal debt; and as to &s;ub&s;equent hold|ers, they had only to look at the face of the certificate, to learn that the &s;tate was obliged to pay that debt to <HI>the bearer.</HI></P>
<P>Again: The Act which created the&s;e certificates &s;peaks of them <HI>as debts.</HI> Thus in &s;ection II, it directs that the margin of the certificates &s;hall be "&s;ufficient for a memorandum of the e&s;&s;ential circum&s;tances of the <HI>debts</HI> to be thereby re&s;pectively &s;ecured." The &s;ame expre&s;&s;ion occurs in the eighth &s;ection.&mdash;They are con&s;idered as <HI>debts</HI> by the Acts of 28th March 1786, and are &s;o called in all the Legi&s;lative proceedings. It was &s;o con&s;idered when the Act or 1789 was before the Hou&s;e, and in their minutes it is &s;tiled a "debt originally due by the United States and a&s;&s;umed by <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> for the relief of her citizens." (See votes A&s;&s;embly, 26th December 1786, page 93-97, and No|vember 1787, page 69; minutes 1789, page 77, 78, and 82, &amp;c.)</P>
<P>Before I di&s;mi&s;s this part of the &s;ubject, permit me to make an ob&s;ervation on what fell from the gentle|man (Mr. <HI>Dexter)</HI> ye&s;terday. He was mi&s;taken when he &s;uppo&s;ed that the memorandum on the margin was to be a memorandum of the <HI>Continental</HI> certificates loaned. On the contrary the memorandum was de|&s;igned to &s;erve <HI>as a check</HI> and to record the e&s;&s;ential circum&s;tances of the <HI>New-Loan certificates,</HI> on who&s;e margin it was made. The inference &s;o ingeniou&s;ly
<PB N="450" REF="027132_0458_0FD3524C0F551C20">
drawn from it, is therefore unfounded: but mi&s;|take was a natural one for a gentleman to whom this &s;ubject could not be familiar.</P>
<P>Thus it appears that the &s;tate made a contract for the payment of the debt not only with the original creditors but with every <HI>bona fide</HI> holder. And if the &s;tate re&s;erved a right to aboli&s;h the debt, where is the evidence of that right to be found? It is not in the law; it is not on the face of the certificate; nor had it a being till the ingenuity of coun&s;el created it.</P>
<P>I here di&s;mi&s;s this point. It is proved that the New-Loans were originally evidences of a debt. 1. By the hi&s;tory of the Act which created it. 2. By the nature of the contract. 3. By the terms of the Act. 4. By the written documents of the Legi&s;lature. And, 5. By the articles of impeachment them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I now proceed to prove, <HI>That the Legi&s;lature did not mean nor bad the power to impair the contract or de&s;troy the debt, by the Act of</HI> 1789.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Legi&s;lature did not mean it; becau&s;e upon a fair and legal con&s;truction of the Act, it only ope|rates to <HI>&s;u&s;pend the payment</HI> but does not affect the <HI>ex|i&s;tence</HI> of the debt.&mdash;The Act of 1786 made provi&s;ion for the <HI>payment</HI> of the intere&s;t&mdash;but the certificates i&s;|&s;ued under it <HI>&s;ecured the debt it&s;elf.</HI> I u&s;e this lan|guage becau&s;e it is the language of the Act.&mdash;A repeal therefore of the Act of 1786 cannot affect tho&s;e certifi|cates. There are no words in the Act under con&s;ide|ration which di&s;cover any intention to affect them, to render them irredeemable or to annul the debt.&mdash;This is always expre&s;sly enacted where the determination is &s;uch. It is &s;o in all ca&s;es where bills of credit are cal|led in. It is &s;o in the Act of 4th December 1789 <HI>(Dal.</HI> 759) where certain certificates for &s;upplies are directed to be brought in, and are declared after a cer|tain day to be irredeemable. This has always been done when the evidence of the debt was meant to be affected. But in the ca&s;e before us there is no com|pul&s;ion on the holders of the New-Loans to bring them
<PB N="451" REF="027132_0459_0FD352220B4D0D18">
in and exchange them. They were left at liberty to hold them, or to exchange them, or to transfer them to others&mdash;The debt and the evidence of it remained &s;ecure though the funds provided by the Act of 1786 were withdrawn.</P>
<P>But it has been much relied on, "that &s;o much of the Act of 1786 as &s;ecures the payment of the <HI>princi|pal &s;um,"</HI> is al&s;o repealed: And it is urged that a re|fu&s;al to pay either intere&s;t or principal is tantamount to annulling the debt.&mdash;But it is obvious that this clau&s;e affected only the certificate's <HI>receivability in the Land-office.</HI> No part of the Act of 1786 directed or &s;ecured the payment of the <HI>principal,</HI> except the &s;ection which made the certificates receivable in that office. There was no adequate fund provided for their redemption, and the hopes of receiving payment in 1796, re&s;ted on the <HI>national faith and honour</HI> of the &s;tate.&mdash;The&s;e were the &s;ecurity of the holder and the&s;e were not affected by the repeal in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>That the word "principal" was not in&s;erted with an intention to annihilate the debt, appears al&s;o by the hi&s;tory of the Act. The bill in its fir&s;t concoction and in all its &s;ub&s;equent &s;tages till two days before it pa&s;&s;ed, was calculated merely to &s;top the payment of intere&s;t. (Minutes A&s;&s;embly 1789, page 78, 143-5.) If it had been pa&s;&s;ed into a law in this form, no que&s;|tion of this kind would have ari&s;en: And as the word "principal" appears to have been in&s;erted on a &s;udden thought, merely to meet that part of the Act of 1786 which made them receivable in the Land-office, it can|not afford a ground for the inference that is drawn from it.</P>
<P>The preamble has al&s;o been relied on as proving the intention of the Act. But, without in&s;i&s;ting that the preamble cannot controul the purview, it may be ob|&s;erved, that it &s;tates the want of funds, which had been diverted to the general government, as the ground of the difficulty: and that it was rea&s;onable that payment of the debts due to the creditors &s;hould be provided
<PB N="452" REF="027132_0460_0FD3524D8C6CC558">
for out of the Trea&s;ury of the United States.&mdash;It was hoped, probably, that Congre&s;s would a&s;&s;ume them&mdash; or, paying the intere&s;t to the &s;tate, enable her to pay it over to the creditors&mdash;and until events &s;hould deter|mine, the incapacity of the &s;tate to meet the demand required a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the payment. But in the mean time an exchange of certificates was offered to tho&s;e who cho&s;e it.&mdash;Circum&s;tances of imperious nece&s;&s;ity may excu&s;e the &s;toppage of payment&mdash;but nothing can ju&s;tify an attempt to de&s;troy the debt.</P>
<P>Again: The debt is &s;o far from being extingui&s;hed by the Act, that the Legi&s;lature recognizes it by di|recting the payment of four years intere&s;t complete and providing a new fund for its redemption. But they do not <HI>compel</HI> the creditors to re&s;ort to this fund. All the expre&s;&s;ions of the Act &s;hew that they have an option either to take back their Continental certifi|cates or to rely on the future ability of the common|wealth. It recites that <HI>"many may be de&s;irous"</HI> to take back their certificates&mdash;that it is "ju&s;t and rea&s;onable" to grant it to tho&s;e <HI>"applying"</HI> therefor, &amp;c.&mdash;Expre&s;|&s;ions which prove that the exchange was di&s;cretionary with the creditors.</P>
<P>"But can that be a debt of which the payment both of intere&s;t and of principal is withdrawn?" Unque&s;tion|ably it can.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is plain that the de&s;truction of the intere&s;t is not the de&s;truction of the debt. Thus during the war, intere&s;t cea&s;ed on <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> debts. So on money attach|ed. The intere&s;t on the &s;tate debts due from confi&s;|cated e&s;tates are at this moment in that &s;ituation. There is no fund for payment of principal or intere&s;t, and yet it is certainly a debt. 2. Neither will the annihilation of funds for the payment of the principal operate thus. If the&s;e certificates had never been receivable in the Land-office, they would neverthele&s;s have been evidences of a debt. The debt is created by the promi&s;e; the means of fullfilling that promi&s;e are quite different from the promi&s;e it&s;elf.&mdash;Be&s;ides, a debt may exi&s;t
<PB N="453" REF="027132_0461_0FD3524F18520B30">
where there are no means of compelling payment. A debt due from one individual to another is not annihi|lated by a defect of remedy. For in&s;tance, when the revolution took place all po&s;itive laws cea&s;ed; the cre|ditor had no means of compelling payment; but al|though the remedy was extinct the debt was in force. So in the ca&s;e of alien enemies; their debts are &s;u&s;|pended, not extingui&s;hed. A &s;imilar point was lately ruled in the highe&s;t tribunal of the United States, <HI>Ge|orgia</HI> v. <HI>Brailsford.</HI> It is the &s;ame ca&s;e in tho&s;e &s;tates where there is no mode of &s;uing the government; tho' they refu&s;e to provide funds for the payment of the principal or intere&s;t of their certificates, tho&s;e certifi|cates are not le&s;s evidences of debts owing from them. So the New-Loans being evidences of a debt rightfully created are not de&s;troyed by the withdrawing tho&s;e funds which the Act of 1786 provided.</P>
<P>It appears to me that the &s;en&s;e of the Legi&s;lature &s;ince the pa&s;&s;ing of the Act of 1789 corre&s;ponds with this con&s;truction. This may be collected from the Act of 29th March 1790, page 784. (Here Mr. <HI>B.</HI> read the Act and commented upon it.)</P>
<P>From the view already taken of this point, it is appa|rent that the Legi&s;lature did not mean to render the New-Loan certificates no longer evidences of a debt; but there is &s;till a &s;tronger rea&s;on for avoiding the op|po&s;ite con&s;truction, which is, that it tarni&s;hes the honor of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI>&mdash;It has been proved that there was a debt &s;olemnly contracted by the &s;tate on a valuable con|&s;ideration. Now what is &s;uppo&s;ed by the articles of impeachment? That the Legi&s;lature intended&mdash;not on|ly to cancel this &s;olemn obligation&mdash;to violate the &s;anc|tity of con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">&mdash;to &s;ap the confidence in the public faith, but a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> to &s;ubvert the hone&s;t principles of go|vernment and violate the Federal Con&s;titution. Sir, it is imputing to the Legi&s;lature a crime greater than that with which the defendant &s;tands charged.</P>
<P>All government is in&s;tituted for the protection of our natural rights. Property is one of the&s;e,&mdash;and proper|ty
<PB N="454" REF="027132_0462_0FD352250BB84268">
in contract is as &s;acred as property in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. We have no &s;afety if this can be violated; and tho&s;e who think that liberty can be &s;ecure where property is not protected will find them&s;elves mi&s;erably mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity of pre&s;erving the faith of contracts be|tween individuals is very apparent. If one man &s;hould give his own obligation in exchange for another, no court of law or equity would di&s;&s;olve the contract:&mdash; and the con&s;titution of the United States prohibits this inju&s;tice in <HI>all</HI> ca&s;es. Why &s;hould there be a difference made between the promi&s;&s;ory note of an individual and of a &s;tate? States are moral per&s;ons, capable of duties and obligations; and none but tho&s;e who adopt the di&s;hone&s;t refinements of the <HI>Florentine</HI> politician will in &s;uch a ca&s;e di&s;tingui&s;h between them. What is it to ju&s;tice whether the one of parties to a contract be one, or many&mdash;an individual&mdash;a corporation or a &s;tate? Power, indeed, may be on one &s;ide, but power is not right. The naked arm of violence may tear the con|tract in pieces, but the immutable ju&s;tice of the de|mand, remains the &s;ame. It is the &s;acred law of na|ture, &s;ays <HI>Puffendorf,</HI> that the faith of contracts be ob|&s;erved. The mo&s;t de&s;potic governments are obliged to re&s;pect this &s;alutary principle&mdash;this voice of the divinity which is heard in every heart amid&s;t all the violence of de&s;ire and the clamours of &s;elf intere&s;t.&mdash;But in republi|can governments the pre&s;ervation of this principle is e&s;&s;ential to liberty. Such at lea&s;t was the conviction of the people of <HI>America</HI> when they formed their Con|&s;titution. They would not &s;uffer &s;o important a prin|ciple to be at hazard and &s;olemnly declared "That no &s;tate &s;hall have power to impair the obligation of con|tracts." This is at once our glory and our reproach; our reproach as the evidence of pa&s;t inju&s;tice; our glo|ry as an eternal bar to &s;uch inju&s;tice in future. This ab|&s;traction of power&mdash;this inability to do wrong is more truly honorable to the &s;everal &s;tates than unbounded authority. I &s;peak not only as coun&s;el for the defend|ant, but as a citizen who loves his country, when I &s;ay;
<PB N="455" REF="027132_0463_0FD352267A01A7B8">
that the pre&s;ervation of this article of the Con&s;titution is of the la&s;t importance. We ought to watch over it with a holy jealou&s;y&mdash;we ought to guard it with unre|mitting zeal&mdash;we ought to re&s;i&s;t the &s;lighte&s;t attempt to de&s;troy or impair it. Among all the captious excep|tions and hone&s;t prejudices again&s;t the Federal Con&s;ti|tution, no oppo&s;ition was made to this principle&mdash;no amendment propo&s;ed by any &s;tate. <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> not only formally approved of, but after three years con&s;i|deration tran&s;planted it into her own Con&s;titution. We there find it placed among "the great and e&s;&s;ential principles of liberty and free government." (Mr. <HI>Bradford</HI> here read the articles in the Con&s;titution of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.)</HI> Around this every hone&s;t citizen ought to rally: and yet this mu&s;t be beaten down before the defendant can be reached.</P>
<P>At the time of pa&s;&s;ing the Act of 1789, the Con&s;ti|tution of the United States was in full force. Ought we then to &s;uppo&s;e the legi&s;lature &s;o forgetful of their duty as to violate it? Is it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ully the fair fame of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> by a har&s;h con&s;truction of the Act when an hone&s;t meaning is ea&s;ily di&s;coverable in it?</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid the Act of 1789 re&s;tores all things to their old &s;ituation&mdash;that this is <HI>equitable and ju&s;t</HI>&mdash;and therefore no violation of the Con&s;titution. To this we an&s;wer, 1. That the contract was to pay money not to re-exchange certificates. The United States might as well annihilate their a&s;&s;umed debts in the &s;ame manner. A man who purcha&s;es land on ground rent might as well in&s;i&s;t upon the &s;eller taking back his land and extingui&s;h|ing the rent; or when farms have been exchanged, that they &s;hould be mutually re&s;tored. This argument will not hold in common life nor in the ca&s;e before us, 2. It did not re&s;tore things to their old &s;tate. The <HI>pur|cha&s;er</HI> of a New-Loan certificate never loaned any thing and the proferred exchange was offering what he did not wi&s;h and taking from him what he cho&s;e to keep. 3. Even tho&s;e who loaned their certificates could not ob|tain the &s;ame certificates again; and if Congre&s;s had made

There is no &s;ecurity but in &s;trictly pre&s;erving the contract. To pretend, as was ye&s;terday &s;aid, that the meaning of the con&s;titution was mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ely this, "that no inju&s;tice &s;hould be done by the &s;tates"&mdash;and at the &s;ame time to leave them the judges of this ju&s;tice in their own ca&s;es, is to fritter away our liberties.&mdash;Ju&s;tice is always the pretence; and even the pine-barren laws, as they were called, were pa&s;&s;ed on the pretence of <HI>Equity.</HI></P>
<P>It has been &s;aid that even a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the payment of the intere&s;t was a breach of the contract as much as the annihilation of the debt. But it may be ob&s;erved that funds for the payment of the intere&s;t were withdrawn by the con&s;ent of the people them&s;elves; and the in|ability to pay will excu&s;e the pre&s;ent &s;toppage of pay|ment, but the obligation of the contract remains. Thus the &s;udden revolution in the form of our govern|ment which ab&s;tracted the funds ju&s;tified a pre&s;ent &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion of payment; and in the mean time a re-exchange was offered to tho&s;e who cho&s;e to look to Congre&s;s, ra|ther than rely on the future ability and faith of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid, Suppo&s;e the Act were contrary to the Con&s;titution, who &s;hall &s;ay &s;o&mdash;what judicature has au|thority to determine upon it? That point need not be much di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. It has more than once been &s;ettled, that the judicial power is inve&s;ted with authority to de|termine on the con&s;titutionality of an Act of the Le|gi&s;lature. In countries where they have no formed Con&s;titution the Legi&s;lature may be con&s;idered as &s;u|preme: But here their Acts are <HI>leges &s;ub graviore lege!</HI> It has &s;o been determined in <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI> in the ca&s;e of <HI>Craig</HI> and others, v.&mdash;and al&s;o in <HI>North-Carolinna.</HI> In <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> we have often heard this doctrine from the mouth of the Chief Ju&s;tice, and a recent determination of the Judges of the United States, on the pen&s;ion laws, proves that they entertain the &s;ame opinion. A decent re&s;pect for the opinion of the Legi&s;lature is very

proper and ought to govern every tribunal in a doubt|ful point; but an undue &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion would be a de&s;er|tion of duty.</P>
<P>But we are pre&s;&s;ed with the objection that this is to &s;et the Judiciary above the Legi&s;lative. But this is by no means the ca&s;e. It only e&s;tabli&s;hes the preeminent authority of the <HI>people. They</HI> are above the Legi&s;la|tive and Judicial. To both they have delegated limit|ted powers; and the Con&s;titution is the &s;upreme rule by which both ought to govern their deci&s;ions.</P>
<P>The objection is founded on principles long &s;ince abandoned. After the truths e&s;tabli&s;hed by our revo|lution&mdash;and in the blaze of political knowledge which illuminates the clo&s;e of the 18th century, I did not ex|pect to hear it affirmed in a republican government, that the &s;upreme power re&s;ides in the Legi&s;lature. It re&s;ides only in the people who have delegated certain portions of it to the different branches of government. Properly &s;peaking neither of the&s;e is &s;uperior&mdash;They are in one &s;en&s;e equal and co-ordinate&mdash;The Legi&s;la|ture is controuled by the Con&s;titution; and to the Ju|diciary the people have entru&s;ted the power of interpret|ing the laws. And as the Con&s;titution is the &s;upreme law, the courts in the exerci&s;e of their functions mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily determine whether the Acts of the Legi&s;lature interfere with its provi&s;ions. (Mr. <HI>Bradford</HI> here re|ferred to and read &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages from <HI>Publius's</HI> letters on the &s;ubject.)</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that the people in ca&s;e of a violation of the Con&s;titution have no remedy but another election. If this be true, there is no &s;ecurity that another election will be in their power. If this be true, the Legi&s;lature might have been &s;pared the trouble and expence of an impeachment. They might have pa&s;&s;ed a bill of pains and penalties again&s;t the defendant, or erected a torture chamber to oblige him to confe&s;s. If this be true our liberties are pro&s;trate at the feet of the A&s;&s;embly, and a <HI>limited</HI> Con&s;titution is of no avail.&mdash;What will the Freemen of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> &s;ay when they find the advo|cate
<PB N="458" REF="027132_0466_0FD3522B2DC8DEF8">
of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives &s;o liberal in &s;ur|rendering their ine&s;timable rights? or what mu&s;t they think of this cau&s;e which cannot be &s;upported without &s;haking the pillars of the Con&s;titution?</P>
<P>To enforce his rea&s;oning on this point the gentleman added that he never heard that any power on earth had a right to adjudge a ca&s;e between a &s;tate and its own ci|tizens. Then, Sir, he never read the Con&s;titution of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> which expre&s;sly provides that a &s;tate &s;hall be &s;ued as an individual. The po&s;ition is a remnant of feudal ignorance;&mdash;and &s;urely in a criminal pro&s;ecution every man has a right to avail him&s;elf, before any tri|bunal, of the &s;helter the Con&s;titution affords.</P>
<P>I will dwell no longer on this &s;ubject. From our examination of it, it is equally evident that the New-Loans are &s;till a debt&mdash;and that the Legi&s;lature did not mean nor had the power to de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>I now proceed to examine the other po&s;ition con|tained in the fir&s;t article. They are, <HI>That</HI> John Nichol|&s;on <HI>declared the&s;e certificates &s;ub&s;cribable to the loan of the United Sates, and that this was a mi&s;demeanor.</HI> The fact of his certifying or declaring them to be &s;ub&s;criba|ble is admitted, except, that he did not certify this, in his own ca&s;e; in which alone he could have derived any advantage from it. But no guilt re&s;ults from this con|duct, if it can be <HI>ju&s;tified</HI> or <HI>excu&s;ed.</HI> We mean to do both, and contend, 1&s;t. That this debt was by law &s;ub&s;cribable to the loan. 2d. That if it was not, it was at lea&s;t his real opinion;&mdash;an opinion hone&s;tly enter|tained by him and many others.</P>
<P>New-Loans are within the de&s;cription of 13th &s;ection of the Act of Congre&s;s. Compare them with it. They were certificates i&s;&s;ued before the 1&s;t January 1790, by the &s;tate of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI>&mdash;as acknowledgments or evidences of debts by her owing.&mdash;They are not within the exception of the &s;ection;&mdash;nor could they be legal|ly refu&s;ed at the Loan-office unle&s;s they could be prov|ed to be no longer evidences of a debt.&mdash;I admit that they mu&s;t be evidences of a <HI>&s;ub&s;i&s;ting</HI> debt;&mdash;but we
<PB N="459" REF="027132_0467_0FD3523309D0D140">
have already proved it to be a debt,&mdash;and it has never been paid off, redeemed or otherwi&s;e legally di&s;charged. The argument need to be repeated.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid it mu&s;t be a debt <HI>recogni&s;ed</HI> by the &s;tate. We an&s;wer, 1&s;t. That it never was di&s;claimed by the &s;tate; though unfunded, it was &s;till a debt undenied. 2d. If it was really an exi&s;ting debt, the &s;ub&s;equent acknowledgement or di&s;claimer of the &s;tate would be of no avail. To decline receiving certificates of a di&s;put|ed debt, was a proper rule in the Trea&s;ury, as they had no power finally to decide on it; but their doubts or difficulties cannot affect the creditor's right. The Act &s;ays no &s;uch thing. Whether the debt be <HI>really owing,</HI> is the only que&s;tion: If it be, it will exi&s;t independant of the will of the debtor.</P>
<P>This a&s;&s;umption by Congre&s;s was not made for the &s;ake of the &s;tate but of the people. The hi&s;tory of the Act is well known. Congre&s;s could not rai&s;e money to pay their debts during the war, and the &s;everal &s;tates were obliged to advance their credit for the United States. The certificates they i&s;&s;ued were con&s;idered as a Federal charge, and yet in many of the &s;tates they were not paid; while in others the &s;tate creditor was a favorite. To put the&s;e, who were in ju&s;tice, creditors of the Union, on a footing, the a&s;&s;umption was deter|mined on.&mdash;Could a &s;tate therefore which might be op|po&s;ed to this a&s;&s;umption, defeat the mea&s;ure by refu&s;ing to recogni&s;e the debt? The very exception of the <HI>North-Carolina</HI> certificates is a proof that it could not. The&s;e were di&s;claimed by that &s;tate, and yet an expre&s;s exception was thought to be nece&s;&s;ary to exclude them.</P>
<P>The amount of the Secratary's letter on this &s;ubject is, that the officers of the Trea&s;ury, who are merely mi|ni&s;terial, take a &s;afe rule in receiving certificates on loan. But this does not preclude an enquiry. A <HI>man|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nus</HI> from the Supreme Court may be i&s;&s;ued to decide the que&s;tion; and if the certificates offered on loan, come within the de&s;cription of the Act, the Trea&s;ury officers would be compelled to receive them.</P>
<P><PB N="460" REF="027132_0468_0FD352369257D4D0">The opinion of the Secretary therefore is not to de|cide this que&s;tion. Yet it may be remarked that he did &s;o far decide upon it as to write to Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> the Loan-officer that he could not refu&s;e the New-Loans if the holders in&s;i&s;ted on &s;ub&s;cribing them. We are told however that the Act of 1789 was not brought into his view; but on comparing what he was written on this &s;ubject it is probable that he did &s;ee it, though he could not &s;ee any &s;uch doctrine in it as is now drawn from it. (Mr. <HI>Bradford</HI> here commented upon &s;everal of the Se|cretary's letters which were read in evidence.)&mdash;It is true, that the certificates have been <HI>virtually</HI> rejected. The expre&s;&s;ion was a cautious one; but the rea&s;on of their being in this &s;ituation is, that <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> who was the holder, took no &s;teps to have them loaned, or the que&s;tion decided. The &s;tate officers even de&s;ired that they might not be received, and the opinion of the Attorney-General of the &s;tate was, that they were not receivable.&mdash;Be&s;ides, in the late con&s;ideration which the Secretary have to the Act of 1789, he &s;ays, that the circum&s;tances of its being pa&s;&s;ed after the ratification of the Federal Con&s;titution did not occur to him.</P>
<P>Whether &s;ub&s;cribable or not, depends therefore whol|ly on the Acts of Congre&s;s.&mdash;It is evident, that the Act contemplates this <HI>very debt</HI> as a &s;tate debt. The 18th &s;ection expre&s;sly provides for a difficulty which could ari&s;e in no other ca&s;e. (Here it was read and explained.) The very nature of <HI>the&s;e</HI> &s;tate debts, was urged in Con|gre&s;s as a rea&s;on for the a&s;&s;umption;&mdash;and there was a peculiar and evident propriety in a&s;&s;uming them. But no difficulty was made on account of the Act of 1789. &mdash;If the New-Loans were to be excluded, why not the &s;ame exception as that re&s;pecting the <HI>North Carolina</HI> certificates? Our delegates were as attentive to the in|tere&s;ts of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> as tho&s;e of other &s;tates; and one of them was a member of the A&s;&s;embly in 1789. The Act of Congre&s;s was not pa&s;&s;ed in a ha&s;ty manner. It lay over a whole &s;e&s;&s;ion a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as time enough for con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><PB N="461" REF="027132_0469_0FD35237D9C3F668">But it is objected that this provi&s;o &s;hews that the New-Loans could not be &s;ub&s;cribed becau&s;e the &s;tate had authori&s;ed no one to &s;urrender the Continental cer|tificates which were exchanged for them. To this two an&s;wers may be given and both of them &s;atisfactory. 1&s;t. This debt was &s;ub&s;cribable under the general inde|pendent clau&s;e of the Act. The provi&s;o re&s;pects only the payment of the intere&s;t and was introduced merely for the &s;ecurity of the United States. It does not in any manner limit or re&s;train the <HI>&s;ub&s;cription.</HI> Such is the con&s;truction given to it by the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury. (Here Mr. <HI>Gib&s;on</HI> read the letter p. 272-3, at the reque&s;t of Mr. <HI>Bradford.)</HI> The &s;tate therefore had the power to &s;ub&s;cribe the Continental certificates to the dome&s;tic loan and the holders of the New-Loans to &s;ub&s;cribe to the &s;tate loan. But intere&s;t would have been paid only on one of the &s;ub&s;cription; and the in|terpo&s;ition of the Legi&s;lature to &s;urrender their &s;ub|&s;cription; would not have been with holden, if the rights of their creditors had required it. 2d. Mr. <HI>Ni|chol&s;on</HI> had power to exchange the Continental certifi|cates for New-Loans, whether they were pre&s;ented by the United States or by individuals. The negociation in 1791 e&s;tabli&s;hed this. (Mr. <HI>Bradford</HI> here ob&s;erved upon the letter relative to that &s;ubject, &s;ee p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">2.)</P>
<P>Another objection is, That the &s;um of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> &s;tate debts a&s;&s;umed by Congre&s;s amounts to 2,200,000 dollars only; whereas if the New-Loans were to be in|cluded, it would have been much greater. But the argument turns the other way; for the whole of what is called the <HI>proper</HI> debt of the &s;tate did not amount near to that &s;um. But the whole amount of the debts of the &s;everal &s;tates was not intended to be a&s;&s;umed; but only a proportionable part of each. And although the New-Loan debt was large, yet great part of it had been already exchanged, and there was rea&s;on to believe that almo&s;t the whole would be &s;o; becau&s;e, generally &s;peaking, it was the intere&s;t of the holders to &s;ub&s;cribe the Continental certificates rather than the New-Loans.
<PB N="462" REF="027132_0470_0FD352069F01B2C8">
(Mr. <HI>Bradford</HI> here exhibited &s;ome calculations of long and &s;hort intere&s;t on the different certificates, to &s;hew their effect on the different loans.) Be&s;ides this advantage, the payment of the intere&s;t on Continental certificates commenced one year before that on the a&s;&s;um|ed debt. It was therefore probable that this &s;um of 2,200,000 dollars would embrace all that would be &s;ub|&s;cribed.&mdash;I will not enlarge on this &s;ubject. The re&s;ult of our enquiry is, that New-Loans <HI>were</HI> &s;ub&s;cribable, be|cau&s;e they were evidences of a debt owing by the &s;tate.</P>
<P>But if a different con&s;truction could be put upon the Act, is it &s;o plain a point that the oppo&s;ite opinion mu&s;t be imputed to di&s;hone&s;t motives and not to con|viction of judgment? Is it a mi&s;take, that can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ex|piated only by a political <HI>auto de &s;e?</HI> Is it a mi&s;take, which every one el&s;e may commit with impunity; but which mu&s;t &s;ubject the defendant to a &s;pecies of o&s;tra|ci&s;m? Forbid it candor&mdash;forbid it ju&s;tice!</P>
<P>I ought now to con&s;ider the <HI>motives</HI> which really ac|tuated the defendant; but it will be more convenient to defer this till the <HI>principle</HI> &s;tated in the 2d article is al&s;o examined.</P>
<P>The &s;econd, third and fourth articles are &s;o intimately connected that the whole may be reduced to this; that the defendant certified certain certificates to be re|deemable which were not redeemable, with a corrupt and di&s;hone&s;t view.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t que&s;tion therefore is, Were the New-Loan certificates redeemable by the Act of the 10th April 1792? The article under con&s;ideration declares that they were not; and on the &s;oundne&s;s of this opinion all the re&s;t of the three articles depend.</P>
<P>The Senate will be plea&s;ed to remember that we con|tend that whatever was &s;ub&s;cribable to the loan was made redeemable by that Act. We admit that they are not within the &s;econd &s;ection of that Act; but they are manife&s;tly included in the &s;ixth. The words of that clau&s;e are remarkably &s;trong: "The holder or holders of any certificate <HI>&s;ub&s;cribable</HI> to the &s;ub&s;crip|tion
<PB N="463" REF="027132_0471_0FD35259852D4588">
&s;o to be renewed, &s;hall be entitled," &amp;c.&mdash;Hence &s;ub&s;cribability and redeemability became convertible terms. The Legi&s;lature put them&s;elves in the power of Congre&s;s. Whatever <HI>&s;tate debts</HI> Congre&s;s &s;hould chu&s;e to a&s;&s;ume, entitled the holder to the benefits of that Act. No other con&s;truction can rationally be put upon this clau&s;e. Even Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> who drew the bill and gave us the &s;ecret hi&s;tory of it, acknowledged the ju&s;tne&s;s of that con&s;truction.</P>
<P>But it has been urged that the &s;ixth &s;ection was not intended to include any debts not included in the &s;e|cond.</P>
<P>Permit me here to remind this honorable body, that a mode of con&s;truction has been introduced which is &s;ubver&s;ive of all legal certainty as well as of per&s;onal &s;afety. We are led from the language of the law, to the private &s;entiments of the members of the legi&s;lature, and to the very manner of drawing the bill. Though mo&s;t the members of this court, were members of the Legi&s;|lature wich pa&s;&s;ed the Act, they will remember that all recollection of private intention at that time, is to be laid a&s;ide con&s;truing its meaning. Its language alone is to be attended to. It is that on which every citizen mu&s;t form his opinion of the law; and to depart from this in judicial con&s;truction is to poi&s;on the fountains of jus|tice. The danger of this has created doubts concerning the propriety of erecting &s;uch a court for the trial of impeachment; and it has been made a great political que&s;tion whether one branch of the Legi&s;lature &s;hould ever decide on charges exhibited by the other. Remem|bering the particular objects they had in view, they are in danger of limiting or extending the words within or beyond their natural and proper import; while the &s;afety of the citizen con&s;i&s;ts in confining the judge to the meaning of the Legi&s;lature as <HI>expre&s;&s;ed in the law it&s;elf.</HI> Inconveniences may &s;ometimes re&s;ult from this; but the partial evil is overbalanced by the general good. <HI>Beccaria</HI> has an excellent chapter on this point. (Mr. <HI>B.</HI> here read &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages from that author.)</P>
<P><PB N="464" REF="027132_0472_0FD352ABFA8B84B0">But why do I dwell on this &s;ubject?&mdash;I am &s;peaking to the Senate of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI></P>
<P>Judging therefore by the <HI>expre&s;&s;ion</HI> of the &s;ixth &s;ec|tion, no doubt of the redeemability of the certificates could remain. But &s;everal objections are made to this; and they &s;eem to be all contained in the report of the committee on that bu&s;ine&s;s. The fir&s;t is, That no funds were provided by the Act for the redemption of the&s;e certificates. I am di&s;po&s;ed to admit that the funds provided, are confined to the debts mentioned in the &s;e|cond &s;ection; but whether any &s;pecific funds were provid|ed or not is immaterial, as by the exi&s;ting laws there was a fund for all <HI>claims.</HI>&mdash;But we mu&s;t recollect that the &s;econd &s;econd was to operate at all events, whether Congre&s;s renewed the &s;ub&s;cription or not; but the &s;ixth was eventual and dependant on that contingency.&mdash;The A&s;&s;embly therefore might chu&s;e to let it re&s;t upon the aggregate funds already mentioned. (Mr. <HI>B.</HI> here went into &s;ome calculations to &s;hew that this might be &s;uffi|cient.)</P>
<P>But the fallacy of their argument is proved by the ca&s;e of the Unfunded Depreciation certificates. They are not included in the &s;econd &s;ection, and yet it can|not be denied they are included in the &s;ixth.&mdash;No &s;pe|cific funds were provided for <HI>them;</HI>&mdash;yet as they were &s;tate debts and a&s;&s;umable, they were of cour&s;e redeem|able. The induction is fair, and even Mr. <HI>Gallatin,</HI> who drew the bill and did not intend to include them, could not with&s;tand its force.</P>
<P>That the Unfunded Depreciation were included was a general opinion. The Regi&s;ter-General and Mr. <HI>Powel,</HI> the late re&s;pectable Speaker of the Senate, were the fir&s;t to put this con&s;truction on the Act. He did not he&s;itate to pre&s;ent &s;uch certificates for redemp|tion, and they were redeemed accordingly. Judge <HI>Yeates</HI> did the &s;ame; and the Legi&s;lature to whom the Regi&s;|ter-General made a report of a large &s;um of the&s;e cer|tificates being redeemed, did not di&s;approve of it. To this day there is no di&s;approbation of it,&mdash;no &s;uit
<PB N="465" REF="027132_0473_0FD352394F1F6A08">
brought;&mdash;and well, &mdash;for where is the court that would &s;u&s;tain it?&mdash;If then Unfunded Depreciation are re|deemable, &s;o are New-Loan certificates.</P>
<P>But to do away the force of this, we are favored with the &s;ecret meaning of the author of the Act. Although we were in darkne&s;s before, now truly we are enlightened&mdash; the film is purged&mdash;a new ray of light breaks in upon us&mdash; and knowing what the drawer of the Act intended, we &s;ee as it were face to face!&mdash;Sin, if &s;uch principles of con&s;truction are to prevail in a criminal pre&s;ecution, the will of a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Cadi would be as &s;afe a rule of conduct as the laws of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania&punc;</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, It is urged that the &s;ixth &s;ection can only be regarded as a provi&s;o or exception to the &s;econd. If the Legi&s;lature intended it as &s;uch, how ea&s;y would it have been, to have added after "certificates? the word "herein before &s;pecified." This would have confined its operati|on to the certificates mentioned in the &s;econd &s;ection. But <HI>&s;i voluit non dixit.</HI>&mdash;The &s;ixth &s;ection as it now &s;tands is a di&s;tinct independant clau&s;e If it operates as &s;uch on the Unfunded Depreciation, why not on the New-Loans? "Becau&s;e, &s;ay they, the&s;e are not a <HI>&s;tate debt."</HI> Here we are thrown back upon the old que&s;tion.</P>
<P>This forms the mind objection in the report of the committee.&mdash;"Becau&s;e," &s;ay they, "it does not ex|tend to any but <HI>&s;tate creditors."</HI> Now, if New-Loans were &s;tate debts, the holders of them mi&s;t be &s;tate creditors. There is no magic in the&s;e words to include Depreciation and to exclude the Loan debt. They are u&s;ed merely to di&s;tingui&s;h the creditors of the &s;tate from the creditors of the United States. We are therefore brought back to that which is the only real que&s;tion in the cau&s;e; whether the&s;e certificates were evidences of an exi&s;ting debt or not?</P>
<P>But it has been hinted that whether in &s;trictne&s;s it were a debt or not, yet it was not <HI>&s;o con&s;idered</HI> by the Legi&s;lature in 1792. What is the proof of this? Their Acts contain no &s;uch thing&mdash;and if an appeal is made to the private opinions of the members, I repeat it, we
<PB N="466" REF="027132_0474_0FD3525BB474B600">
cannot take notice of them.&mdash;As to the Comptroller, <HI>he</HI> always con&s;idered them as debts. In his &s;tatement of the 10th December 1791, he &s;peaks of them as &s;uch, and the word "redemption" which has been urg|ed again&s;t him, refers only to the Land-office, from which the Act of 1789 had excluded them.&mdash;It was properly ob&s;erved that it was not the duty of the Comp|troller to bring them forward in any other view, as there was no pre&s;ent intention or ability to pay them.</P>
<P>Thus it appears that none of the rea&s;ons urged in &s;upport of the con&s;truction which the articles put upon the Act, will apply. We mu&s;t therefore re&s;ort to the plain <HI>language</HI> of the Act. Whatever Congre&s;s &s;hould make a&s;&s;umable the Legi&s;lature made redeemable. Nay, thee Act goes further, and makes the acceptance in the Continental Loan-office, the rule for paying the nominal value by the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The New-Loans therefore are included. And what are the inconviences of this con&s;truction?&mdash;The hold|ers were citizens of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania;</HI> they have given up certificates for the payment of which the &s;tate was bound at lea&s;t to the amount of her quota&mdash;and reciev|ed a &s;olemn promi&s;e to be paid 20&shilling; in the pound.&mdash;And yet the burden of the complaint is, that <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> was by the defendant's conduct obliged to pay this 20&shilling; in the pound!</P>
<P>The certificates which the &s;tate received in exchange have been and may be again &s;old at their nominal va|lue;&mdash;but if the &s;tate could get them without paying a &s;hilling in the pound, it &s;eems as if it would be very acceptable.</P>
<P>Sir, this eagerne&s;s to put a little profit by the rife and fall of &s;tock into the pocket of the &s;tate is di&s;reputable. It is to repre&s;ent the &s;overeign &s;tate of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> as a jobber in the &s;tocks. Such was not the intention of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives when they brought for|ward this impeachment.</P>
<P>Upon the whole it appears that the&s;e New-Loans were a debt&mdash;that its exi&s;tence was not affected by the
<PB N="467" REF="027132_0475_0FD3523BD2ACF5C8">
Act of 1789&mdash;that of cour&s;e they were &s;ub&s;cribable to the loan, and being &s;ub&s;cribable were redeemable. Hence if <HI>John Nichol&s;on</HI> did "recogni&s;e, certify and declare them to be &s;ub&s;cribable and redeemable" he did no more than the law authori&s;ed him to do.</P>
<P>Having now come to a dividing point of my argu+ment, and finding it impo&s;&s;ible to fini&s;h the whole in the cour&s;e of the morning, I &s;ubmit it to the Senate whether it will not be convenient to adjourn.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Lewis</HI> ro&s;e, and ob&s;erved, that the gentleman mu&s;t have been much exhau&s;ted, having &s;poken four hours, had yet much to &s;ay, and he reque&s;ted the Se|nate to adjourn till next morning. Adjourned.</P>
<P>In the minutes of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives the following entry is recorded&mdash;</P>
<P>"In conformity to the re&s;olutions of the 29th day of February la&s;t, the Hou&s;e re&s;olved it&s;elf into a com|mittee of the whole in order to attend the trial of <HI>John Nichol&s;on,</HI> Comptroller-General.</P>

<HEAD>Fourteenth day of the Trial. <HI>FRIDAY, MARCH 1.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SENATE met as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>Mr. BRADFORD in continuation.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Senate,</HI></P>
<P>Having, ye&s;terday, di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the <HI>legal</HI> po&s;itions con|tained in the fir&s;t and &s;econd articles of impeach|ment, I am now prepared to examine the <HI>fact</HI> charged in tho&s;e articles. It is, That the defendant declared New-Loan certificates to be &s;ub&s;cribable and redeema|ble, and cau&s;ed them to be redeemed, with corrupt views, and in wilful violation of his duty.</P>
<P>We have endeavoured to prove that he was right in his con&s;truction of the law; but if it be admitted that he was wrong in that, &s;till he is excu&s;able, and no guilt is imputable to him, if his conduct flowed from conviction of judgment and not from corruption of heart. It is therefore of importance to &s;ift his conduct thoroughly, and to &s;ee what were his real opinions and motives. The que&s;tion then is, <HI>Did John Nichol&s;on act thus knowing or believing it to be wrong?</HI> I am willing to put the cau&s;e on this &s;imple i&s;&s;ue without holding the oppo&s;ite coun&s;el to the proof of all the aggravations charged in the articles. It may however be proper to take &s;ome &s;light notice of the&s;e, as they have been pre&s;&s;ed again&s;t the defendant.</P>
<P>To begin, then, with the fir&s;t article: It is &s;tated that he declared the&s;e certificates &s;ub&s;cribable&mdash;" under co|lour of his office&mdash;and in violation of the confidence re|po&s;ed in him."&mdash;It appears that he made this certification in very few in&s;tances; and that this was done at the reque&s;t of Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> or of individuals, who wi&s;hed to
<PB N="469" REF="027132_0477_0FD352B04C567280">
transfer or &s;ell their ab&s;tracts before the certificates due on them, would i&s;&s;ue from the Loan-office. This was an accommodation to tho&s;e who reque&s;ted it, but it was not an <HI>official</HI> act. No Act of Congre&s;s nor of the &s;tate, either required or forbid it. Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> did not certify it officially; he did not affix his official &s;ignature; he merely &s;ub&s;cribed the initials of his name. This was not obligatory on the Commi&s;&s;ioner of Loans, nor did he ab&s;olutely depend upon it. It is in proof that he gave a receipt importing that the certificates were &s;till &s;ubject to examination; and in this examina|tion he was directed by the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury to depend on no one but him&s;elf and his own clerks.&mdash;Be|ing therefore tru&s;ted neither by the United States or the &s;tate of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> re&s;pecting this matter, the defend|ant's conduct could be no violation of official duty. But to &s;ay "that if it was an official act it was a breach of duty and if it was not an official act, he exceeded his powers and thus violated the confidence repo&s;ed in him" &mdash;is a very convenient argument! This is to put the de|fendant on the bed of <HI>Procru&s;tes:</HI> If he is too long, lop him; if he is too &s;hort, &s;tretch him.</P>
<P N="2">2d. It is charged that it was done "in order to pro|mote his own emolument." This cannot be true, for he did not certify the certificates, pre&s;ented by him&s;elf, to be a&s;&s;umable; and in tho&s;e ca&s;es where he did cer|tify, no emolument was or could have been in view. But this circum&s;tance <HI>of it&s;elf</HI> cannot aggravate the charge. To promote our own intere&s;t, is an hone&s;t end, if pur&s;ued by hone&s;t means. If the certification was <HI>wilfully</HI> wrong, whether it was done for his own or another's emolument, he ought to &s;uffer; nay, it would be inexcu&s;able to promote the greate&s;t charity on earth, by di&s;hone&s;t means.&mdash;But it will pre&s;ently be &s;een that he acted hone&s;tly; and that he &s;incerely believed what he certified to be true. It was an opinion which he entertained &s;o early as the 30th September 1790 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">efore the loan opened, and &s;o late as December 1791, after it was clo&s;ed.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="470" REF="027132_0478_0FD3523D32635E48">3d. It is charged to be a "mi&s;demeanor as contrary to the Act of 1789." We have already di&s;cu&s;&s;ed that point, and &s;hewn that it was not contrary to that Act; but if it were, yet, if the heart was free it could he no mi&s;demeanor.</P>
<P N="4">4th. La&s;tly, it is &s;aid to be manife&s;tly to the ri&s;k and <HI>injury</HI> of the commonwealth <HI>as he well knew.</HI> This is the point&mdash;the &s;ting of the accu&s;ation. If this be true, we do not a&s;k his acquittal; and I ha&s;ten to &s;hew he did not <HI>know or believe</HI> that he was injuring the commonwealth.</P>
<P>In taking a view of the defendant's conduct, I am led to notice the repre&s;entation that has been given of it by the gentlemen who preceded me. I acknowledge the beauty of the painting&mdash;the &s;trength of the figures and the glowing elegance of the colouring; but I cannot perceive that a likene&s;s to the original has been at all regarded. It is, in truth, a fancy picture, which &s;hews the &s;kill of the painter; but it is not a portrait, which exhibits the ju&s;t features of the cau&s;e. It may impo&s;e on an inattentive ob&s;erver; but I tru&s;t that &s;o delu&s;ive a repre&s;entation will have no effect on this court, to whom all the facts are di&s;tinctly known, and who will form their judgment from an impartial view of the whole.</P>
<P>That the conduct of the comptroller did not pro|ceed from the di&s;hone&s;t motives will appear, fir&s;t. From its being founded on an early opinion&mdash;conceived at a time when no advantage could be derived from it&mdash;an opinion fortified by that of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable cha|racters, and re&s;ulting from a thorough view of the &s;ub|ject. Secondly. From all the circum&s;tances of the tran&s;action which taken &s;eperately or together evince the rectitude of his intentions.</P>
<P>The Senate will con&s;ider that proof of his holding the&s;e opinions at a time when no private or intere&s;ted views could po&s;&s;ibly actuate him, mu&s;t be deci&s;ive. I will endeavor to trace the proofs of this in order of time.</P>
<P><PB N="471" REF="027132_0479_0FD3523E7808C9A0">(Mr. <HI>Bradford</HI> then went into a minute examination of the evidence, and to prove the early and continued opinion of Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> that New-Loans were &s;ub&s;crib|able, he made &s;everal ob&s;ervations, 1&s;t. Upon the letter of the Comptroller 30th September 1790, p. 271-2. 2d. His letter to the Governor 24th December 1791. p. 220-1. 3d. His letter to Secretary <HI>Ha|milton</HI> 29th December 1791, p. 227. 4th. Upon the conference between him and the Secretary, p. 288. 5th. His report to the Governor 29th December 1792, p. 223-4. 6th. His plan of finance and his ob&s;er|vations thereon, p. 284.)</P>
<P>Being &s;atisfied that the&s;e certificates were &s;ub&s;criba|ble he could not avoid believing that they were redeem|able, becau&s;e the&s;e were in fact convertible terms. As &s;oon as the Bill or Act of 1792 was publi&s;hed for con&s;i|deration, he informed Mr. <HI>Evans</HI> of his opinion on this point, in which that gentleman concurred; and in a conference with Mr. <HI>Donnald&s;on</HI> and Mr. <HI>Gallatin,</HI> it was agreed by them all, that whatever certificates were &s;ub&s;cribable were al&s;o redeemable. Hence it follows, that Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on's</HI> opinion of their being redeemable was not a new opinion but &s;ub&s;tantially the &s;ame with that which he had entertained long before, and at a time when no po&s;&s;ible intere&s;t could influence him.</P>
<P>Although he perceived &s;o early as the middle of March that the New-Loans would, if the bill pa&s;&s;ed, become redeemable, he was &s;o far from de&s;iring to avail him&s;elf of the advantages it pre&s;ented, that we find him &s;olicitous to prevent its pa&s;&s;ing into a law. He even remon&s;trated again&s;t it to &s;everal members of A&s;|&s;embly; and declared that he thought the words com|prehen&s;ive enough to embrace bills of credit. But the repre&s;entations which he made to Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> and others were not attended to&mdash;the Act was pa&s;&s;ed; and the door being opened, he had as good a right to enter as any other per&s;on.</P>
<P>From that time until June, when he certified &s;ome of the&s;e certificates to be a&s;&s;umable, we have no proof
<PB N="472" REF="027132_0480_0FD352B27B273810">
of his opinion on this &s;ubject being expre&s;&s;ed; but his conduct &s;hews that it was firmly fixed;&mdash;&s;o firmly that he ri&s;ked his property and reputation upon it. He purcha&s;ed this &s;pecies of certificates with a determina|tion to &s;ub&s;cribe them; nay, to &s;ub&s;cribe them under circum&s;tances, which made the hopes of profit <HI>depend|ant upon the &s;oundne&s;s of his opinion;</HI> for he affected no concealment, and if he had, it would have been un|availing. He knew al&s;o that if he was wrong in his con&s;truction of the law, he would be expo&s;ed to the lo&s;s of character.</P>
<P>In July, Mr. <HI>Donnald&s;on</HI> who had heard the opinion of New-Loans being &s;ub&s;cribable, circulated out of doors, con&s;ulted the Comptroller about it. Mr. <HI>Ni|chol&s;on</HI> avowed the opinion, and &s;atisfied the Regi&s;ter-General of its ju&s;tne&s;s; and &s;o fully that he did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ult any other officer, but pa&s;&s;ed the ac|counts and ab&s;tracts, although he knew them to com|prehend <HI>New-Loans.</HI> He certified them to the Govern|or, and would have gone farther, if the warrants i&s;|&s;ued upon them had not been &s;topped in his hands.&mdash; Why then is not the Regi&s;ter included in the im|peachment? Becau&s;e it is evident that he acted from conviction of judgment. Why not extend the &s;ame charity to the Comptroller; for it is not pretend|ed that the under&s;tanding of the Regi&s;ter is more cloudy or weak than that of Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>La&s;tly, we find the Comptroller avowing the &s;ame opinion to the Secretary of the Commonwealth, who found him pa&s;&s;ing the account of Judge <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> which related to New-Loan certificates. His expre&s;&s;ion was, "I am &s;ure I am right, and that it is the regular con|&s;truction of the Act."</P>
<P>Thus it appears that long before as well as after the Act, he con&s;tantly avowed one unvaried opinion on this &s;ubject, and under circum&s;tances which prove that it could be no other than the re&s;ult of a convic|tion of judgment.</P>
<P>Here it will be proper to notice a few objections.</P>
<P><PB N="473" REF="027132_0481_0FD351EF40605FE0">1&s;t. It is &s;aid, that the letter alledged to be written to the Governor on the 16th April 1792 did not include the New-Loans, and therefore that neither the Compt|roller nor Regi&s;ter con&s;idered them as redeemable.&mdash; Admitting that &s;uch a letter was written, which is very doubtful on the evidence, it is &s;aid to have been in con&s;equence of the requi&s;ition of the Governor, who de&s;ired a calculation might be made of the quantity of &s;tock nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;old under the Act of 1792.&mdash;The calculation that was then made could only be founded on the 2d &s;ection, which did not include the New-Loans. The Act of Congre&s;s had not then pa&s;&s;ed; and the &s;ixth &s;ection of the law had then no operation, and it was therefore unnece&s;&s;ary to include <HI>the&s;e</HI> certificates in the calculation. For the &s;ame rea&s;on the Unfunded Depreciation were not included, although Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Gal|latin, Donnald&s;on</HI> and <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> concurred in opinion that they would be redeemable if Congre&s;s &s;hould a&s;|&s;ume them. Here, again, we may a&s;k, why do we acquit the Regi&s;ter-General and not the Comptroller al&s;o?</P>
<P>Again: It was hinted, that whatever the language of the Act might have been, yet he knew the real in|tention of the Hou&s;e, which was explained to him by Mr. <HI>Gallatin.</HI> The an&s;wer is, that Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> could only give his own opinion; the intention of the Legi&s;la|ture is to be collected from the law; the Act &s;peaks for it&s;elf. Nothing more need be &s;aid on this point.</P>
<P>From this review, the inference is clear, that the defendant was fully and hone&s;tly of opinion, that the&s;e certificates were both &s;ub&s;cribable and redeemable.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid that this opinion was &s;trongly fortified by that of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable characters.&mdash;It is true this is no <HI>proof</HI> of his con&s;truction of the law being right; but it forms a &s;trong ground of excu&s;e if he was mi&s;taken, to &s;hew that others were mi&s;taken with him. If it was an error, it certainly was an error which had the appearance of truth.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e who entertained this opinion we find the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, who&s;e di&s;cernment and
<PB N="474" REF="027132_0482_0FD351F0A6F2B400">
penetration will be doubted by no one. It was his duty to decide in the fir&s;t in&s;tance upon this que&s;tion. He had called upon the Loan-officer for all the laws rela|tive to it, and he afterwards declared to him, "That the holders of the New-Loans have a right to &s;ub&s;cribe them; that he might endeavour to per&s;uade them to re-exchange their certificates, but if they per&s;i&s;ted that he could not refu&s;e them." He intimates the &s;ame opinion to the Governor in his letter, 21&s;t December 1791, and the conference with the Comptroller was founded upon it. At this time, it is evident, he mu&s;t have ex|amined the Act of 1789, though he does not recollect that it was before him; and if he afterwards di&s;tru&s;ted his former opinion, he explained it by adding, that it did not occur to him that the Act of 1789 was pa&s;&s;ed after the ratification of the Federal Con&s;titution.&mdash;But the que&s;tion is, What was the Secretary's opinion at the time he had the conference with the Comptroller, not, what it appears to be at pre&s;ent?</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioner of Loans entertained the &s;ame o|pinion of their &s;ub&s;cribability; &s;o did Mr. <HI>Wolcot,</HI> as may be fairly inferred from his letter. The Governor al&s;o is officially apprized of the &s;ame opinion, and tho' he does not expre&s;s his concurrence, yet his conduct was founded on a belief that the Comptroller was right in his con&s;truction of the law. Indeed it &s;eemed &s;o obvious a con&s;truction, that few who examined the Act, doubted it. Almo&s;t all, whom he conver&s;ed with, a|greed with him. Mr <HI>Evans</HI> was convinced of the &s;oundne&s;s of the opinion, and determined to adventure in a purcha&s;e of the&s;e certificates. Mr. <HI>Donnald&s;on</HI> was convinced, though not <HI>deluded.</HI> Of the &s;ame opinion were Mr. <HI>Boggs,</HI> Mr. <HI>David Rittenhou&s;e,</HI> Judge <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> and others. The la&s;t mentioned gentleman examined the Act which Mr. <HI>Dallas</HI> &s;hewed to him in the Council-chamber, and he was &s;o fully &s;atisfied, that he received the amount of his certificates from Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> who advanced the money, in order to ac|commodate him.&mdash;Why then &s;hould it be deemed cri|minal
<PB N="475" REF="027132_0483_0FD3520F19AC3C30">
in the Comptroller to yield his a&s;&s;ent to what convinced &s;o many?</P>
<P>Second. The hone&s;ty of his intentions appears from all the circum&s;tances of the tran&s;action.&mdash;If he had been con&s;cious of any unju&s;tifiable views he would have attempted concealment; but his conduct was open and fair. He concealed nothing but what was proper to be concealed; and as &s;oon as the &s;ub&s;cription was made he was carele&s;s who knew it.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, it appears that he made the loan, and &s;ub&s;cribed in his <HI>own name.</HI> It would have been ea&s;y to have u&s;ed another's, and to have concealed him|&s;elf under the name of a friend. Again: He in&s;erted certificates in his ab&s;tract, which mu&s;t have di&s;covered to the Regi&s;ter-General and others, that they were New-Loans.&mdash;Thirdly. He did not attempt to hurry it through the offices. It lay there the u&s;ual time and went through the u&s;ual train of bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;Be&s;ides, he knew that the &s;ub&s;cription of New-Loans mu&s;t be known not only to all the officers of the Trea&s;ury of the United States, but al&s;o to the &s;tate, when an ar|rangement for delivering up the Continental certificates became nece&s;&s;ary. He al&s;o certified the ab&s;tracts of others, who had no motives for concealment and would no doubt mention the tran&s;action. In this ca&s;e, if his con&s;truction of the law was not tenable, he would be obliged to refund. The clum&s;y fraud, if it had been a fraud, could not fail of being detected, and if it were detected, his hopes would be blown up, and mu&s;t have proved fruitle&s;s.</P>
<P>To the in&s;inuation that all this was done for the purpo&s;e of getting money into his hands <HI>for a time,</HI> which he could not finally keep, I have nothing to &s;ay. His circum&s;tances were not &s;o mi&s;erably dependant as to make this pitiful &s;cheme po&s;&s;ible.&mdash;In &s;hort, he mu&s;t have been de&s;titute of common &s;en&s;e if he had acted thus openly and incautiou&s;ly, without a perfect convic|tion that he was legally as well as morally right.</P>
<P><PB N="476" REF="027132_0484_0FD352471F95E830">I &s;hall now di&s;mi&s;s the fir&s;t and &s;econd articles, and proceed briefly to examine the third and fourth.</P>
<P>I con&s;ider the third article as a mere &s;tatement of evidence, and if the two former articles cannot be &s;up|ported, neither can <HI>this,</HI> which is urged to prove his cor|rupt views and his endeavours to avoid di&s;covery and de|tection. For this purpo&s;e it is charged, 1. That he did not con&s;ult the Regi&s;ter. To this the an&s;wer is plain, that no law obliged him to con&s;ult that officer; and why &s;hould he have con&s;ulted him when he had no doubts on the &s;ubject? Be&s;ides, it was unnece&s;&s;ary; for &s;oon after the law pa&s;&s;ed, he and the Regi&s;ter &s;ettled the principle, that whatever was &s;ub&s;cribable was redeemable.&mdash;A|gain: It is &s;aid, 2. That "he did not con&s;ult the Go|vernor;" and to this it has been replied, that the law directs him to con&s;ult the Governor only in tho&s;e ca&s;es where the officers differ in opinion. It may be added that he did in fact appri&s;e the Governor of it when he informed him that the New-Loans were a &s;ub&s;cribable debt.&mdash;It is charged, 3. "That he did not <HI>di&s;criminate</HI> in his certification nor in his accounts," &amp;c. As to this certification to the Loan-officer, it was not an offi|cial act, and the &s;tate has nothing to do with the form of it; and as to the account rai&s;ed and tran&s;mitted to the Governor, it is a deci&s;ive an&s;wer that they were ren|dered in the manner which had been &s;ettled in April 1791. The&s;e accounts <HI>originated</HI> in the Regi&s;ter-Ge|neral's office and were &s;ent up to the Comptroller mere|ly for concurrence. Yet the purity of the Regi&s;ter's views is not impeached, nor is <HI>he</HI> included in the ac|cu&s;ation.</P>
<P>But, Sir, the ab&s;urdity of the charge is evident, for this conduct could not have been adopted for the pur|po&s;e or avoiding detection, becau&s;e the &s;pecies or cer|tificates contained in the ab&s;tracts were di&s;coverable from the ab&s;tracts them&s;elves: 1. By the different dates of intere&s;t. And, 2. By the reduction of the principal &s;um, which took place in no other &s;tate certificates.</P>
<P><PB N="477" REF="027132_0485_0FD352B48B1EA248">La&s;tly, it is &s;aid that the checks of office were thereby de&s;troyed. What checks are there pointed out by law or former u&s;age, which have not been ob&s;erved? There are none; and the Regi&s;ter-General, even after he was informed that the ab&s;tracts comprehended New-Loans, pur&s;ued the &s;ame method as before. There are no grounds for this flim&s;y charge, which &s;eems to be thrown in merely to &s;well the account! (Mr. <HI>B.</HI> made &s;ome further ob&s;ervations on the evidence, and then pro|ceeded to the fourth article.)</P>
<P>The fourth article depends upon the third&mdash;"In the <HI>above</HI> delu&s;ive manner," &amp;c.&mdash;It is but another mode of &s;tating the &s;ame thing.&mdash;If he be acquitted of the third charge, he cannot be convicted of this.&mdash;The ar|ticle goes on and &s;ays, that "he certified that the New-Loans were redeemable and payable." He had a <HI>right</HI> to do &s;o, if by law they were redeemable&mdash;he is <HI>excu&s;|able</HI> in doing &s;o, if he really thought them to be redeem|able.&mdash;As to the funds, the Act of 1792 is not refer|red to, but that of April 1791. (Mr. <HI>B.</HI> then made &s;ome ob&s;ervations on this Act to &s;hew that this fund for claims might be applied to the redemption of the New-Loans.) There was no other fund than this for the redemption of the Unfunded Depreciation. Yet the Governor did not &s;cruple to i&s;&s;ue warrants for the pay|ment of the&s;e, though it was evident from the amount of the intere&s;t &s;tated in the accounts that it could ari&s;e from that &s;pecies of certificates only.</P>
<P>Here again I may be permitted to a&s;k, why is not the Regi&s;ter-General included in the accu&s;ation, &s;ince he joined in this certification to the Governor as well as the defendant? Since both acted alike, why this di&s;|crimination? I am per&s;uaded that both are equally in|nocent.</P>
<P>But I quit this article, which is of no importance if the defendant &s;hould be convicted of the other charges &mdash;and if he is acquitted of them, he cannot be affect|ed by this.&mdash;They depend one upon the other, in a manner that reminds us of the Indian philo&s;ophy. The
<PB N="478" REF="027132_0486_0FD351F2CDBF68C0">
world, &s;aid the <HI>Bramins,</HI> re&s;ts upon the back of a great elephant&mdash;the elephant on the back of a huge tortoi&s;e&mdash; and the tortoi&s;e on&mdash;they did not know what. So the fourth article &s;tands on the back of the third&mdash;the third on the &s;econd&mdash;the &s;econd on the fir&s;t&mdash;and the fir&s;t on &mdash;nothing at all.</P>
<P>We now come to charges of a different nature from tho&s;e which have hitherto pa&s;&s;ed in review before us. The fifth and &s;ixth articles are, however, &s;ub&s;tantially the &s;ame, and charge the defendant with availing him&s;elf of certain official advantages for the purpo&s;e of &s;pe|culating in certificates. To the fir&s;t of the&s;e we might have &s;afely demurred, and admitting the fact, have re|lied on the law that it is not impeachable. But this would have heen u&s;ele&s;s, &s;ince the Senate being judges both of law and fact, will acquit the defendant, unle&s;s the facts proved are the proper &s;ubject of <HI>legal</HI> pro&s;e|cution.</P>
<P>Permit me to remind the Senate that impeachments mu&s;t be founded on the breaches of exi&s;ting laws. In|dulgence may be &s;hewn to the <HI>form,</HI> but none to the <HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI> of the charge: And an impeachment cannot make that criminal here which would not be &s;o before the ordinary tribunals of ju&s;tice. (Mr. <HI>Bradford</HI> here quot|ed 4 <HI>Black.</HI> Com. 256.2. <HI>H. P. C.</HI> 250, and <HI>Woodi&s;on's</HI> lectures.) Indeed the learned gentlemen, although one of them talks of "doing &s;ub&s;tantial ju&s;tice," will not openly contend that any thing is impeachable which is not ab&s;olutely illegal.</P>
<P>This honorable body therefore will recollect that they are not <HI>now</HI> to judge by the rules of expediency. That is the province of a Legi&s;lature not of a Court. Some things are lawful which many may think inexpedient; but while the citizen only exerci&s;es his rights, he is amenable only to the tribunal of public opinion. True liberty con&s;i&s;ts in being always permitted to do that which the <HI>laws</HI> do not forbid; and a republican go|vernment has been well defined to be a government of laws and not of men. We are, therefore, not to di&s;cu&s;s
<PB N="479" REF="027132_0487_0FD352B5B79C7728">
in this place the <HI>propriety</HI> or <HI>impropriety</HI> of the defend|ant's conduct; but its <HI>lawfulne&s;s</HI> or <HI>unlawfulne&s;s.</HI> We are not to enquire whether in any in&s;tance he has over|&s;tepped the extreme delicacy of official conduct, but whether he hath overleaped the mounds of the law. Delicacy is one thing, crime is another; and we judge by very different rules re&s;pecting them. To mark the preci&s;e limits of the <HI>proper</HI> and the <HI>improper</HI> is the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of critici&s;m and ta&s;te; and the deci&s;ion will de|pend upon our education, habits, feelings and temper. &mdash;But the law is the only &s;tandard by which we can mea&s;ure the conduct of a citizen criminally accu&s;ed.</P>
<P>There are men of &s;o &s;oft a contexture, that far from in&s;i&s;ting on their rights, they make the expedient the rule of their conduct. They will not even eat meat, if thereby they &s;hould offend a weaker brother. They &s;hrink like a &s;en&s;itive plant from the touch of cen&s;ure &mdash;and their minds are accu&s;tomed to take the varying hue of public opinion. But men of more republican firmne&s;s will &s;tand on their rights. They will judge for them&s;elves of the proper and improper; and rely|ing with confidence on the conclu&s;ions of their own minds, they are &s;atisfied if they find the laws do not prohibit their conduct.&mdash;Judging therefore by the&s;e principles, the defendant mu&s;t be acquitted; for what law made it unlawful for him to purcha&s;e certificates in the manner this article &s;tates?&mdash;Whether &s;uch official advantages &s;hall be allowed or not, is a matter of <HI>po&s;itive</HI> regulation. Some &s;tates allow their officers to &s;peculate in articles, in which their official &s;ituation gives them manife&s;t advantages: Some forbid them; and the general government prohibits it more generally than the &s;tates. Thus in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> the auctioneers were allowed to purcha&s;e at their own auctions until l783, when it was forbidden. The officers of the Cu&s;toms by the laws of the &s;tate mght have traded; by tho&s;e of the United States they cannot. The Se|cretary of the Trea&s;ury and even the clerks in the of|fice cannot &s;peculate in certificate; but in all the de|partment
<PB N="480" REF="027132_0488_0FD352B9AB4D1158">
of our Trea&s;ury it is different. So the offi|cers of our Land-office may deal with great advantage in land; and it is clearly lawful becau&s;e no Act forbids it.&mdash;If the conduct of any officer is in the opinion of the Executive manife&s;tly improper though not illegal, the remedy is by removal not by impeachment.</P>
<P>But in the ca&s;e before us there were no official advan|tages that de&s;erve any con&s;ideration. He could have bought the&s;e certificates as conveniently at a brokers as from tho&s;e who came to the office; and a &s;mall ad|vance would have poured them into his hands. He is charged with purcha&s;ing them of <HI>many;</HI> but only two in&s;tances of &s;uch purcha&s;es are proved; that from <HI>Oldden</HI> and that from <HI>Biddle.</HI> If this be criminal, by what Act is it made &s;o?&mdash;He has broken no law of the &s;tate, and therefore no guilt is imputable to him.</P>
<P>We now proceed to the &s;ixth article, which is no|thing more than the fifth new-vamped. It charges the &s;ame facts but &s;uppo&s;es that the certificates bought were really <HI>the property of the &s;tate.</HI> This legal po&s;i|tion is wholly unfounded. Mr. <HI>Dexter</HI> &s;tated the offer to exchange as an executed contract&mdash;and as a complete transfer of the certificates to the &s;tate, before an <HI>actual</HI> exchange took place. But his rea&s;oning on this point is fallacious. The certificates were lodged merely for examination, and the indents, required to complete the exchange, were not offered. How then could they be|come the property of the commonwealth?</P>
<P>Let us bring this point to the touch-&s;tone of the law. Could the &s;tate have &s;ued Mr. <HI>Oldden</HI> for the indents? No, for an <HI>option</HI> is given him only on condition of his payment of the indents. The Act of 1789 permits, but does not compel an exchange. Again: Could <HI>Bid|dle</HI> or <HI>Oldden</HI> have maintained a &s;uit again&s;t the &s;tate for the Continental certificates without an actual ten|der of the indents? Surely not; for it is &s;ettled, that where two concurrent acts are to be done at the &s;ame time, one party mu&s;t do all that on his part is to be done before he can maintain a &s;uit again&s;t the other.&mdash;
<PB N="481" REF="027132_0489_0FD352BBEED5D288">
The property therefore remained as before. The hold|ers, who lodged them, might have wre&s;ted them from the Comptroller in an action of trover; and they would have been liable in his hands, to the debts of the individual.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it was the uninterrupted practice to re-deliver them, if required, after they had been lodged in the office. In proof of this we have the ca&s;es of <HI>Thomas Hale</HI> in 1791, <HI>Danniel Stroud</HI> in 1793 and Col. <HI>Porter.</HI></P>
<P>If the gentlemen be right in their law, all the&s;e per&s;ons were plundering the commonwealth, becau&s;e they took back their certificates&mdash;and yet they do not &s;eem con&s;cious of any impropriety! But really this refinement on the charges is unworthy of a &s;tate pro|&s;ecution!</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid "that if the Comptroller delivered back the&s;e certificates to tho&s;e who lodged them, he was guilty of perfidy." Well Sir! the Comptroller offici|ally informed the Governor that <HI>S. Mark</HI> had with|drawn his certificates and parted with them to others. Here is an avowal of "this perfidy" to the Executive Magi&s;trate who is &s;o far from di&s;mi&s;&s;ing or puni&s;hing the Comptroller that he does not expre&s;s any &s;urprize at the information. If this be a crime you cannot con|vict the defendant without involving the Governor in a degree of the &s;ame guilt.</P>
<P>There being, therefore, no ground to &s;ay that certifi|cates in that &s;ituation were the <HI>property of the &s;tate,</HI> it follows that the 6th article does not differ from the fifth.</P>
<P>But we are told that re&s;pon&s;ibility of officers is the great &s;ecurity of Republics. Sir, there is a re&s;pon&s;ibi|lity of character and a re&s;pon&s;ibility of puni&s;hment. The former we will an&s;wer in another place; the latter ari&s;es only from a breach of the laws. Shew us then the Act of A&s;&s;embly that we have broken; if there be none, &s;hew us at lea&s;t &s;ome adjudged ca&s;e which makes &s;uch kind of dealing a crime. If there be &s;uch a ca&s;e, it will &s;weep like the &s;cythe of time; it will cut down
<PB N="482" REF="027132_0490_0FD352BD40ADACF0">
great and &s;mall, and many fair and unblemi&s;hed cha|racters will come within its reach and may be brought before this honorable court.</P>
<P>If there be circum&s;tances here that require further di&s;cu&s;&s;ion they &s;hould be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed el&s;ewhere. I wave any further enquiry&mdash;for the Senate cannot decide up|on them.</P>
<P>I ha&s;ten to the <HI>la&s;t</HI> article&mdash;and rejoice that at length I &s;ee land. The amount of this is, that he plundered the &s;tate&mdash;that he filched from the ma&s;s of public pro|perty a certain certificate which had been exchanged with the commonwealth. If this be true, he mu&s;t be a wretch indeed! he would not de&s;erve the honor of an impeachment. Such a charge brought again&s;t <HI>any</HI> man ought to be well &s;upported; but brought again&s;t a man of unblemi&s;hed character, the proof ought to be &s;trong indeed. It ought to be &s;upported by a num|ber of witne&s;&s;es, or at the lea&s;t, by the lucid te&s;timony of one man &s;peaking po&s;itively to the fact, on who&s;e me|mory and recollection the firme&s;t reliance might be placed. But what is the number of witne&s;&s;es again&s;t the defendant?&mdash;One. What the impre&s;&s;ions on his memory? They re&s;emble the traces on the &s;and of the &s;ea-&s;hore.</P>
<P>The charge is, That Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> exchanged this certificate with the &s;tate,&mdash;and as it was afterwards &s;ub&s;cribed by the defendant&mdash;the inference is that he embezzled it.&mdash;It mu&s;t therefore be fir&s;t proved &s;atis|factorily that Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan did exchange it.</HI> Let us examine this.</P>
<P>It is probable that he had &s;uch a certificate &s;o late as September 1790;&mdash;and it is certain that Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> had it in July 1792. He &s;ays he did not <HI>&s;ell</HI> it to <HI>Nichol&s;on;</HI> but whether he exchanged it or not he cannot tell, for he &s;old to others. Such certificates as were un&s;old he carried to the Comptroller to be exchanged. When the witne&s;s cannot &s;wear that he delivered the certificate in que&s;tion to the defendant, can you, gentle|men
<PB N="483" REF="027132_0491_0FD327FE5C335858">
upon your oaths &s;ay that he did? Here is not the &s;hadow even of pre&s;umptive proof!</P>
<P>Even in the ca&s;e of a mi&s;erable felon indicted for larceny, it mu&s;t be fir&s;t proved that a larceny was com|mitted, before he &s;hall be put to make any defence. If the owner &s;hould &s;ay, I cannot &s;ay it was &s;tolen&mdash;" I had &s;uch articles"&mdash;"I &s;old to others."&mdash;The candor, of the Attorney-General would induce him to direct an acquittal. Principles e&s;tabli&s;hed for the &s;afety of all mu&s;t not be violated. They require proof in this ca&s;e as well as in that ju&s;t &s;tated: but Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> cannot recollect what became of the certificate in que&s;|tion.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid altho' the evidence is not very per&s;picu|ous yet it is &s;ufficient to oblige the defendant to &s;how how he came by it. No! <HI>They</HI> aver the fact. They cannot &s;tir a &s;tep till they have proved the exchange: But if any fact can be di&s;tinctly &s;een thro' the thick mi&s;t&mdash;the palpable ob&s;curity which the te&s;timony of this witne&s;s has &s;hed upon the tran&s;action, I am &s;ure it is not the fact required. The witne&s;s will not &s;wear that.</P>
<P>But it is urged "That if Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on bought</HI> this certificate, it is capable of proof." Indeed! then if Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan exchanged</HI> it, it is al&s;o capable of proof. "But the latter kept no account of his certifi|cates!" and what proof have we that the former did. Why, it is &s;aid, he is a regular man&mdash;he keeps a diary! I appeal to you gentlemen if that was fairly urged; &s;ince we offered to produce it and they would not &s;uffer it to be read. But that was a diary of his official, not of his private, tran&s;actions. It commenced in March 1792. How then could it a&s;&s;i&s;t us in tracing a certifi|cate &s;ub&s;cribed to the loan which clo&s;ed in 1791?</P>
<P>Again it is &s;aid, "If the per&s;on exi&s;ts upon earth who &s;old it to the defendant he may be produced." At pre&s;ent it is &s;ufficient to a&s;k, What if he does not exi&s;t upon earth? Who can keep his witne&s;&s;es alive? In what a terrible &s;ituation would many be if &s;uch modes of proof are to prevail. Thou&s;ands would be unable
<PB N="484" REF="027132_0492_0FD351F509547550">
to trace the certificates they hone&s;tly bought. They pa&s;s from hand to hand. Often no note made of the &s;eller's name or of the purcha&s;e. In &s;uch ca&s;e your own oath will not be received; and a purcha&s;e of this kind will be incapable of proof.</P>
<P>The danger of obliging a defendant to produce &s;uch proof even when there are &s;trong pre&s;umptions again&s;t him is con&s;iderable. What would Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> have done, had <HI>Hans Hamilton</HI> been dead?</P>
<P>Once more it is &s;aid that Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> delivered him <HI>many</HI> certificates. We an&s;wer that we <HI>bought</HI> ma|ny. The an&s;wer is equal to the proof.&mdash;La&s;tly, it was &s;aid, "What other proof could be produced?" I re|ply, that they ought clearly and po&s;itively to prove the exchange or to forbear the charge. There is no ex|treme difficulty in making &s;uch proof if &s;uch were the fact.</P>
<P>This is a &s;ufficient an&s;wer <HI>at pre&s;ent.</HI> The time may come when this matter &s;hall be fully under&s;tood. Here, in a criminal pro&s;ecution, it would not be proper for him to an&s;wer upon oath; but in the civil &s;uit, he will &s;ubmit to interrogatories. They may prove his heart to the bottom and I tru&s;t they will find it hone&s;t.</P>
<P>But what is the manner in which the te&s;timony on this article has been taken?&mdash;The longer I live the more I perceive the nece&s;&s;ity and advantage of <HI>viva voce</HI> te&s;timony in criminal pro&s;ecutions.&mdash;Had the wit|ne&s;s been examined openly before you, the doubt or the certainty with which he &s;poke would have evidently appeared. But when his an&s;wers are reduced to writ|ing they appear to the be&s;t advantage, and we can only judge from the expre&s;&s;ion. Yet even this exhibits a recollection feeble and uncertain. Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> is known to be a man of the mo&s;t perfect integrity and uprightne&s;s. He will not &s;wear what he does not re|member; and in his examination the burden of the &s;ong is, <HI>I cannot recollect</HI>&mdash;I cannot tell." (Mr. <HI>B.</HI> then read the an&s;wers to &s;hew how very frequently the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions occurred.)</P>
<P><PB N="485" REF="027132_0493_0FD351FAD3C06580">Can we then be &s;ure, even when he &s;tates a fact, that he has not forgotten all the circum&s;tances attending it which &s;erve to explain or qualify it? If every que&s;tion that leads to an explanation is an&s;wered with, "I cannot tell," or refu&s;ed to be an&s;wered at all, what can we rely on? All that we can be &s;ure of is, that he carried a bundle of certificates to the Comptroller's office and left them with him, even without counting them, hav|ing, as he &s;ays, the mo&s;t unbounded confidence in Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on's</HI> integrity. That the certificate in que&s;tion was one of them, we have not the &s;hadow of proof.&mdash; Shall the defendant then be convicted on &s;uch flim&s;y evidence&mdash;the imperfect te&s;timony of an unrecollect|ing individual? There is no <HI>proof</HI> of the exchange&mdash; there is not even a probability&mdash;there is a bare po&s;&s;ibi|lity. Even that po&s;&s;ibility is an&s;wered by our produc|ing the ab&s;tracts of the certificates exchanged by Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan.</HI> In the&s;e, the certificate in que&s;tion does not appear.&mdash;We might therefore venture to &s;ay that it is not po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Again&s;t &s;uch evidence a &s;imple denial of the charge is enough; but when it is aided by a fair fame and up|right character, formed by a life of unblemi&s;hed inte|grity, every &s;u&s;picion vani&s;hes.</P>
<P>When I &s;peak of character, I mean the reputation he enjoyed before the jealou&s;ies and cruel &s;u&s;picions which the manner of conducting this bu&s;ine&s;s has excited again&s;t him, exi&s;ted. The&s;e however will not injure him here. We call no witne&s;&s;es to prove his character becau&s;e it is well known. I appeal then to you, gentlemen, who have per&s;onally <HI>known</HI> him&mdash;to you who have known him <HI>long</HI>&mdash;to you who have known him <HI>intimately</HI>&mdash; who have looked as it were into his bo&s;om and &s;een the bottom of his heart&mdash;I a&s;k you, if ye have not always found him an upright citizen&mdash;an hone&s;t man! Put this into the &s;cale again&s;t that which is charged with the the accu&s;ation&mdash;and ye will find that the proof again&s;t him is as du&s;t upon the balance.</P>
<P><PB N="486" REF="027132_0494_0FD352C10AED39D8">Here then let us pau&s;e; and from this point as from the eminence of truth, look back upon the field over which we have travelled.

<P>We feel not the weight of the accu&s;ation; but we cannot be in&s;en&s;ible to that of our accu&s;ers.&mdash;The ac|cu&s;ation of the Repre&s;entatives of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> can|not but in&s;pire prejudice. To prevent the effects of that prejudice, the Con&s;titution contemplated this ho|norable Court, and placed the accu&s;ed &s;afe under the independence and magnanimity of this high tribunal; a tribunal, &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;uperior to that awe which the mo&s;t numerous and influential branch of the Le|gi&s;lature might otherwi&s;e in&s;pire.</P>
<P>As this is the fir&s;t impeachment, we are now to make an experiment intere&s;ting to republican government. We are to &s;ee if the citizen is as &s;afe here as before the or|dinary tribunals of ju&s;tice. It is to decide, whether one order of the repre&s;entatives may &s;afely be the judge when the other is the accu&s;er; and whether under any circum&s;tances it be advi&s;able to depart from a trial by a jury of our peers.&mdash;As for us, <HI>we</HI> have no doubt but
<PB N="487" REF="027132_0495_0FD352C33A399FD8">
that this Judicial authority is &s;afely depo&s;ited. We have no doubt but you will weigh with caution and de|cide with firmne&s;s&mdash;that your ears will be open to the voice of truth but deaf to the clamours of &s;u&s;picion. So doing, Mr. Speaker, may you and this honorable Court receive that be&s;t of all rewards, the approbation of your own con&s;ciences. Adjourned.</P>

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. The &s;aid <HI>Hans Hamilton</HI> on his &s;olemn oath depo&s;eth and &s;aith, That in the month of February in the year of our Lord one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and ninety-one, this deponent being then in the city of <HI>Philadelphia</HI> did apply to <HI>John Nichol&s;on</HI> with New-Loan certificates for the &s;ums expre&s;&s;ed and mentioned in the fir&s;t interrogatory, among others in order to have them funded in &s;tock of the United States. The whole amount of which New-Loan certificates was 1237l. 16s. 10d. as the bu&s;ine&s;s could not be tran&s;acted at the commi&s;&s;ioner of Loan's office for the State of <HI>Penn&s;yl|vania</HI> before the fir&s;t day of April then following, as this deponent had been informed by Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> the commi&s;&s;ioner of Loans, and expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s at the delay and expence he would nece&s;&s;arily be &s;ub|jected to on that account, reque&s;ted that Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> would be &s;o obliging as to take the management of the bu&s;ine&s;s in his behalf upon him&s;elf (he being a gen|tleman in whom this deponent had particular confi|dence, and who had on former occa&s;ions been friendly to him in a&s;&s;i&s;ting and expediting him in his bu&s;ine&s;s) giving the &s;aid <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> power to commute the &s;aid certificates for &s;uch <HI>&s;um</HI> or &s;ums as he would be entitled to in &s;tock of the United States, and in &s;uch manner as the &s;aid <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> might judge to be this deponent's be&s;t advantage.</P>

If &s;o, did you, or did you not agree to this propo&s;ition and thereupon deliver to &s;aid <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> your certificates of New-Loans as afore&s;aid, and did you or not, then take the private obligation of &s;aid <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> to do as he had propo&s;ed&mdash;and if &s;o, what became of &s;aid obligation?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 2. This deponent in con&s;equence of his own reque&s;t and Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> con&s;enting and agreeing thereto did thereupon deliver up the &s;aid New-Loan certificates amounting to &pound;. 1237:16:10 as afore&s;aid
<PB N="490" REF="027132_0498_0FD3534F8FFDC3E8">
to the &s;aid <HI>John Nichol&s;on,</HI> who thereupon gave him a certain writing or obligation to commute the certificates in manner afore&s;aid or purporting to that effect as this deponent believes, which writing or obligation, together with other papers of this deponent was lo&s;t as this de|ponent believes on the 4th day of November following, at the time of General <HI>St. Clair's</HI> defeat. The &s;aid obligation was always con&s;idered by this deponent as a private undertaking by Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> and not as given in an official capacity.</P>
<P><HI>Inter.</HI> 3. Did you or did you not afterwards and if &s;o at what time return to the city and repair to Mr. <HI>Ni|chol&s;on</HI> to put you in the way to draw the intere&s;t on your &s;tock, and did you or not then find he had trans|ferred to you a part of the &s;tock of the United States, to which by contract afore&s;aid you were entitled for your New-Loan certificates afore&s;aid, and did you or did you not then receive your intere&s;t, and did you or not continue your certificates of that &s;tock upon which you &s;o drew intere&s;t in the care and cu&s;tody of Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 3. This deponent &s;ays that to the be&s;t of his recollection he returned to the city of <HI>Philadelphia</HI> in the fir&s;t week or in the beginning of April in the year A. D. 1792, and having called on Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> to know what had been done in regard to the certificates with which he had been entru&s;ted by him as afore&s;aid; he was given to under&s;tand that the bu&s;ine&s;s had been tran&s;acted and the papers left at Mr. <HI>Smith's</HI> office, that upon this deponent calling at the &s;aid office&mdash;one of the Clerks of &s;aid Loan-office told this deponent, the papers or funded certificates had been given to Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI>&mdash;and upon this deponent's returning to Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> and informing him what the Clerk of the Loan-office had &s;aid.

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 4. This deponent about the 18th day of Janu|ary, A. D. 1794, again returned to the city, at reque&s;t of Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> expecting to be examined upon the &s;ubject of the trial. That on the 20th of the &s;ame month, he, this deponent received from the &s;aid <HI>John Nichol&s;on</HI> three certificates which had hitherto, and by this deponent's con&s;ent, remained in his care and cu&s;|tody.

<P><HI>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Senate,</HI></P>
<P>I COME forward before you, engaged by the com|mittee of managers of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives to conduct this cau&s;e; I come forward to &s;upport the char|ges
<PB N="498" REF="027132_0506_0FD352E1F76F1DC8">
again&s;t the Comptroller-General of the &s;tate of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI> This cau&s;e is very important in it&s;elf, from the nature of the charges, the high authority of the tribunal, and the intere&s;t of the party. I tru&s;t ne|verthele&s;s that this la&s;t con&s;ideration will not influence the tribunal, but that if &s;trong ample evidence be produced, the conviction of the defendant will be the con&s;equence, public ju&s;tice require that a meritorious and innocent per&s;on who &s;hould receive an injury &s;hould be acquitted: The &s;ame principles demand the puni&s;h|ment of the guilty, as an acquittal in the re&s;pect would be improper. If the Comptroller-General &s;hall be found infringing the laws of his county, the weight of re&s;pectability will not, it is to be expected, &s;upply the want of evidence.</P>
<P>Such State pro&s;ecutions can only exi&s;t in free govern|ments. It is therefore wi&s;ely and judiciou&s;ly interwov|en in the Con&s;titution of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> it is the duc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives to impeach; it is the bu|&s;ine&s;s of the Senate to try the impeachment.</P>
<P>We find the &s;ame Con&s;titution denies the Supreme Executive the power of pardoning. The Senate in ca&s;es of conviction is therefore in &s;ome degree ve&s;ted with a di&s;cretionary power to puni&s;h. The &s;ame Con|&s;titution has certain limits which cannot be pa&s;&s;ed&punc; but within the extremities of it are certain di&s;cretion|ary powers. The puni&s;hment of the officer &s;hould be proportionate to the nature of the offence or mi&s;de|meanor. What if an officer is found unworthy of con|fidence and unfit to &s;erve his country? In the fir&s;t place he can be removed from office; in the next place; if it it is deemed proper, he may be rendered incapable to hold any office of profit or tru&s;t during life. (Mr. <HI>Wilcocks</HI> then read the article in the Con&s;titution re|&s;pecting impeachments, &s;ee page 210 of this.)</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee limits which cannot be pa&s;&s;ed, but within the&s;e limits are di&s;cretionary powers according to the different degrees of offences; the Senate has full power to exerci&s;e the &s;evere or linient kind.</P>
<P><PB N="499" REF="027132_0507_0FD353045C1B6F40">This cau&s;e hath been &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lly and repeatedly travelled ever, I feel <HI>repugnance</HI> at taking up &s;o much of your time, as the going over it again would require. I will however endeavour to touch on the merits of the prin|cipal parts, and will confine my&s;elf to tho&s;e points mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially connected with the pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>The two fir&s;t articles can be con&s;idered in one point of view; the &s;everal Acts of Congre&s;s and A&s;&s;embly to which each of the&s;e articles refers, makes it proper to cla&s;s them together, as the ob&s;ervations and rea&s;on|ings will bring them into one point of view at the &s;ame time <HI>(He then read the &s;ub&s;tance of the two fir&s;t articles.)</HI></P>
<P>As to the facts contained in the&s;e two articles, they are plainly proved, or openly acknowledged and avow|ed. It appears from an in&s;pection of all the ab&s;tracts except his own large one, that they are certified to be ge|nuine and <HI>a&s;&s;umable</HI> in the hand writing of the Comptrol|ler-General. It hath been remarked on by every gentle|man engaged as coun&s;el for the defendant, but not much relied on, that his own ab&s;tract was not certified <HI>genu|ine</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;umable;</HI> I am clearly of opinion, that it need not be much relied on; for if one &s;ingle in&s;tance can be proved, in which he criminally certified New-loan certificates to be <HI>genuine</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;umable,</HI> it is &s;ufficient to &s;upport the charges.</P>
<P>They &s;ay he certified none of his own ab&s;tracts. When the circum&s;tances come to be con&s;idered, all his ab|&s;tracts are in his own hand-writing, and contain all the information to the Commi&s;&s;ioner of Loans that he could de&s;ire. Advert to the two fir&s;t articles, he is not charged that he certified on the face of the ab&s;tracts; but he is charged with recognizing, certifying and de|claring New-Loans <HI>genuine</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;umable,</HI> If there is any &s;pecies of common law proof, that he certified to the Commi&s;&s;ioner of Loans, it is &s;ufficient to &s;upport the charges; then why will it not appear as well from the ab|&s;tracts being made out in his own hand-writing. He was early called upon by <HI>Thomas Smith,</HI> the Commi&s;&s;ion|er of Loans, for checks to prevent counterfeits and impo|&s;ition;
<PB N="500" REF="027132_0508_0FD352E803A77C60">
Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> &s;ends two certificates to him (&s;ee letters page 271-2.) What can be more &s;atisfactorily proven, than that the commi&s;&s;ioner of Loans thought them a&s;&s;umable, when the ab&s;tracts appeared in his own hand-writing?</P>
<P>With regard to the certification to the Governor (&s;ee letter, page 356) it was certainly official. This will not be di&s;puted here as it hath been el&s;ewhere, where they contend that he certified as <HI>John Nichol&s;on,</HI> and not as Comptroller-General. If neither the laws of the Union, or of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> enjoined it on him, this is a very &s;ingular and &s;trange doctrine indeed!</P>
<P>In thus certifying it is very true, that he acted in his official capacity. Nineteen twentieths of the agency of the public officers ace not pre&s;cribed by law, &s;o in the departments of the Land-office, Finance or any others, there are various in&s;tances in all of them to be di&s;covered, which are not particularly mentioned in the laws; the Acts generally point out only the outlines of the different offices. To act contrary to the cour&s;e of the offices, or to devi&s;e ways and means in oppo&s;ition to the rotine of the offices, are offences again&s;t the&s;e Acts, equally obvious as if &s;pecially and expre&s;sly pointed out by law.</P>
<P>Independently, therefore, the Comptroller-General could not act in any other than in his official character. The commonwealth of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> was deeply inte|re&s;ted in that Act; &s;he wi&s;hed to act fairly and &s;ecurely with the United States. If the law is not expre&s;&s;ive enough, &s;hall nothing be done? Every officer was to act according to the duties of his re&s;pective department and when called upon to act with zeal in his official ca|pacity.</P>
<P>We therefore find <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> deeply intere&s;ted in the due execution of the Act of the 10th of April 1792, which made redeemable the debts which were &s;ub&s;cribable. It was of great con&s;equence to <HI>Penn&s;yl|vania</HI> that none &s;hould be improperly &s;ub&s;cribed.</P>
<P><PB N="501" REF="027132_0509_0FD352ED7B8B06D8">How can the Comptroller-General deny his official agency? That officer and the Regi&s;ter-General, in their joint communication to the Governor (&s;ee letter, page 217, 218) are conclu&s;ive on this head, wherein they point out the mode of conducting this bu&s;ine&s;s with the Commi&s;&s;ioner of Loans: <HI>"Examine the &s;ame as to their being genuine certificates and a&s;&s;umable,"</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>How then can the Comptroller-General &s;ay, that he was not acting in his official department?</P>
<P>I now come to the con&s;ideration of the que&s;tion, whether the New-Loans were &s;ub&s;cribable as State debts to the loan opened by the Act of Congre&s;s of the 4th of Augu&s;t 1790. It hath ever been impre&s;&s;ed on my mind, that independent of the Act of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> of the 27th March 1789, New-Loans were not &s;ub&s;crib|able to the loan of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>After the adoption of the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution, Con|gre&s;s found her&s;elf ea&s;y in her &s;ituation and perfectly competent to the &s;atisfying all her dome&s;tic debt; and then contemplated the &s;ituation of the different &s;tates; among them &s;he &s;aw a number of individuals labouring under debts created by the war; &s;he contemplated the taking of &s;uch, as in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, the United States were not &s;ubject to be called upon, nor liable to a de|mand on them. This was the motive the General Go|vernment had for opening the loan.</P>
<P>The gentlemen have mentioned the de&s;cription of <HI>State Debts</HI> receivable in this loan, and then a&s;k if the New-Loans are not comprehended under this de&s;crip|tion! It is true they are, but tho&s;e are not the only pre|requi&s;ites; for in the &s;ame &s;ection we find, they mu&s;t be <HI>i&s;&s;ued for &s;ervices or &s;upplies:</HI> The&s;e were the e&s;|&s;ential requi&s;ites, and the New-Loans <HI>being only grant|ed for others,</HI> they could not be within the meaning of the Act.</P>
<P>Now, &s;uppo&s;e for a moment that the New-Loans were receivable, what would be the effect? <HI>Penn&s;ylva|nia</HI> was to have the benefit of &s;ub&s;cribing 2,200,000 dollars; nay, let us &s;uppo&s;e twice the &s;um if you plea&s;e,
<PB N="502" REF="027132_0510_0FD352EF1D59EE68">
for there was then near twice the &s;um out, the &s;ub&s;crip|tion of the New-Loans would exclude the proper State debt of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI> This would burthen the com|monwealth, which the law was de&s;igned to a&s;&s;i&s;t. How would <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> be ca&s;ed then? Her condition would not be meliorated, for New-Loans are in effect no more than Continental certificates, only in another name.</P>
<P>The 18th &s;ection of the law of Congre&s;s was intro|duced not to invite the New-Loan holders to &s;ub&s;cribe, but from an apprehen&s;ion that they would be offered, and to guard again&s;t the con&s;equences. This clau&s;e (18th &s;ection) hath been, and I &s;uppo&s;e will again be urged, that the&s;e New-Loan certificates will be received. They might by po&s;&s;ibility, or by mi&s;take be &s;ub&s;cribed, but then all intere&s;t is to cea&s;e until the Continental certificates be delivered up. Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that Congre&s;s would a&s;&s;ume them, when double intere&s;t might have been paid on the &s;ame &s;um?</P>
<P>New-Loans were never a money debt of <HI>Penn&s;ylva|nia,</HI> neither were they &s;ub&s;cribable or redeemable un|der her laws. The con&s;ideration of this part leads me to think that Congre&s;s never meant to include them in the a&s;&s;umption.</P>
<P>But a more important que&s;tion ari&s;es, that is, Can they be contemplated as &s;ub&s;cribable after the pa&s;&s;ing of the Act of 1789?</P>
<P>I apprehend New-Loans were never a money debt to be paid on or before the year 1796. This will ap|pear from the Act of 1786.</P>
<P>The New-Loan was a certificate of a contract or en|gagement between the commonwealth and the public creditors, her citizens. The intent of which was that <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> engaged to pay the intere&s;t half yearly, and the creditor pledged with her his certificate as a &s;ecurity, the provi&s;ion was intended as a temporary re|lief, and to continue until Congre&s;s &s;hould be able to di&s;charge her own engagements, and then if <HI>Penn&s;yl|vania</HI> cho&s;e &s;he might authori&s;e an exchange of New-Loans
<PB N="503" REF="027132_0511_0FD32821A7410AB0">
for Continental certificates, and the public cre|ditors have re&s;ort to Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Our attention hath been called to the Act of December 18th, 1780, for the depreciation of the the pay of the army; and it is a&s;ked, why &s;hould not <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> a&s;&s;ume the one as well as the other? It was in order to &s;hew when <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> contemplated a permanent debt &s;he knew how to di&s;tingui&s;h between the depreciation certificates and tho&s;e i&s;&s;ued in 1786. The depreciation certificates were i&s;&s;ued at the earne&s;t &s;olicitation of Congre&s;s; this commonwealth agreed to a&s;&s;ume the depreciation certificates, Congre&s;s being unable to pay the debt, called upon the individual &s;tates to pay it, promi&s;ing at the &s;ame time, that they would repay them.</P>
<P>Here then, are circum&s;tances and inducements to do the one, and not the other. All &s;he did was to calcu|late the &s;um due to each per&s;on for the depreciation of his pay in the army, the Act makes a provi&s;ion for the redemption both of principal and intere&s;t, and re&s;erves the right of paying them off in &s;pecie, or in any other current money equivalent.</P>
<P>I will now proceed to con&s;ider the nature of New-Loan certificates. Previous to the pa&s;&s;ing of the Act of 16th March 1785, it is obvious to the recollection of every per&s;on, that the war was then over, the Federal Con|federation &s;hewed it&s;elf inadequate to the purpo&s;es of good government; Congre&s;s had a great foreign and do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">tic debt, and not able to call on the individual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for re&s;ources and revenues. In this torpid &s;itu|ation, the public creditors who were citizens of <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania,</HI> laboured under inconveniences, re&s;orted to their own government, praying relief.</P>
<P>The Legi&s;lature then pa&s;&s;ed the Act of the 16th of March 1785, in which &s;he ordered her quota &pound;.123932 of intere&s;t to be paid into the Loan-office of the Unit|ed States, and ordered the Loan-officer to pay it to the public creditors, citizens of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania;</HI> this &s;he did at the pre&s;&s;ing &s;olicitations of her citizens; who were
<PB N="504" REF="027132_0512_0FD3281B759B8A90">
in di&s;tre&s;s, as Congre&s;s could not relieve them, this is &s;tated in the preamble to be their motive, the 18th &s;ec|tion makes it temporary until Congre&s;s could pay; this is the &s;pirit and intention of the law of 1785, the &s;ame motives pervade all the &s;ub&s;equent Acts on the &s;ubject: And her de&s;igns were never to make any other engage|ments further than therein contained.</P>
<P>It may be a&s;ked, and I now mention it, why did not <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> a&s;&s;ume all this debt, as &s;he did in the ca&s;e of the depreciation of the pay of the army? <HI>An&s;wer.</HI> It was not done at the de&s;ire or in&s;tance of Congre&s;s, but by her own voluntary act. If this commonwealth had waited for the recognition of Congre&s;s, perhaps Congre&s;s would not recogni&s;e what <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> had done. She knew this appropriation was unplea&s;ant and di&s;agreeable to Congre&s;s, who wanted her&s;elf the application of the funds in her own hands. Moreover the depreciation of the pay of the army, was an a&s;certained &s;um very mo|derate, and far inferior to the other debt.</P>
<P>Thus the object of the act of 1785, was found di&s;|agreeable to Congre&s;s, and in September 1785, &s;ix months afterwards Congre&s;s determined to defeat the provi&s;ions of that act, as being di&s;agreeable to her, and gave directions to her officer accordingly. Thus we find all the benevolence, all the advantages intended by <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> ab&s;olutely defeated by tho&s;e re&s;olves of Congre&s;s, and the creditors reduced to the &s;ame difficult &s;ituation they were in before the pa&s;&s;ing of the act of 1785. Thus circum&s;tanced, when the Legi&s;lature met in March 1786, &s;he found the &s;ame cau&s;e exi&s;ting as in 1785, the creditors &s;till craving further relief, as there had been no change in their condition &s;ince March 1785; it was a rea&s;onable idea, that finding the citizens, public creditors in the &s;ame &s;ituation, &s;he &s;hould contemplate how they might make &s;ome other provi&s;ions for the exigencies of tho&s;e creditors on the &s;ame ground, &s;ame principles and &s;ame manners: It is pre&s;umed, that the &s;ame men called upon to act in the cour&s;e of one year would act as they did before.</P>
<P><PB N="505" REF="027132_0513_0FD352F04012E008">It was not nece&s;&s;ary to give more relief, but it was ex|pedient to give it in a different way. The Legi&s;lature rea&s;oned a little here, they con&s;idered their former re|lief was defeated by Congre&s;s. How was it to be done? It was a perplexing thing; &s;ome other mode mu&s;t be adopted without the intervention of the public offices of Congre&s;s; &s;ome good arrangements were nece&s;&s;ary. It would not do to &s;ay, that every creditor &s;hould bring his bundle of Continental certificates to the State-Trea|&s;urer to receive his intere&s;t on them; this was imprac|ticable and un&s;afe to the commonwealth; be&s;ides, where was her &s;ecurity, that if &s;he paid &s;o, it ever would be repaid her? The Legi&s;lature knew that it was an un|plea&s;ant bu&s;ine&s;s to Congre&s;s, and that &s;he defeated the &s;ame mea&s;ure &s;ix months before.</P>
<P>Some other mode mu&s;t therefore be devi&s;ed; the idea of a loan was propo&s;ed, and the expedient adopted; the i&s;&s;uing of New-Loans were devi&s;ed only to give a con|venient mode to the creditor, and to continue only till Congre&s;s &s;hould do ju&s;tice to all her own creditors. How is this project to be carried into execution? We find, Sir, to effect this bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;he directs certain cer|tificates of her own to be i&s;&s;ued and given in exchange for Continental certificates: The amount of the Con|tinental certificates, their numbers, dates and other e&s;|&s;ential circum&s;tances of the debt to be &s;tated in a large margin; it is worthy of attention to con&s;ider how it was directed to be done. <HI>(Mr, Wilcocks then read a part of the Act of March</HI> 1786.) The preamble &s;hews the Act of 1786 grew out of the re&s;olves of Congre&s;s, which defeated the Act of 1785, and only went to &s;ecure the intere&s;t, becau&s;e it was not done at the call of Congre&s;s, but voluntarily by <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> to relieve her own citizens. It is "inexpedient" to continue un|der that law, &s;ays the Legi&s;lature, but ju&s;t and rea&s;on|able that our creditors &s;hould be relieved as far as cir|cum&s;tances will admit. The Trea&s;urer is to provide certificates with a proper <HI>margin</HI> &s;ufficient to contain the e&s;&s;entials of the debt to be &s;ecured. It was calculated
<PB N="506" REF="027132_0514_0FD328224D79DFF8">
with this view to make it ea&s;y to return it; they never meant an ab&s;olute engagement, never meant to pay, el&s;e why not make a certificate for the amount of prin|cipal and intere&s;t? Every caution was taken by the Le|gi&s;lature to &s;hew they meant &s;omething beyond a pur|cha&s;e: Had they de&s;igned a purcha&s;e they would have required the principal and intere&s;t to be calculated, and have directed a certificate to i&s;&s;ue at once for their amount, not doing it &s;hews they did not de&s;ign a pur|cha&s;e; an individual would have given his bond for the amount; therefore the ca&s;e of the depreciation New-Loan certificates are very different; in the depreciation there was no margin, they meant different things, a &s;pecial &s;pecies of &s;ecurity, to contain the e&s;&s;entials of the debts thereby to be &s;ecured, and the annual pay|ment of intere&s;t which &s;hall have been made thereon, to be prepared by the Trea&s;urer, delivered to the Compt. Gen. to be by him counter&s;igned and delivered out.</P>
<P>Then, Sir, I tru&s;t from the&s;e ob&s;ervations, that the ca&s;e of the i&s;&s;uing of depreciation and New-Loans are very different, and that the Legi&s;lature meant or in|tended this as the mo&s;t convenient mode to facilitate the payment of intere&s;t on the New-Loans. All the&s;e circum&s;tances mentioned to be recorded in the margin, and directed by the Act are as good as if they had a place in the very body of the certificate, and are equi|valent to a part of the contract.</P>
<P>The marginal notes and the printed part are one con|tract, as if they had borrowed or received per margin|al notes &s;uch a certificate and to &s;uch an amount &s;pe|cified in the margin: That the Comptroller-General or Trea&s;urer might not be at the trouble of going over and over again the Continental certificates, but be able at one view on what &s;um intere&s;t is to be calculated.</P>
<P>Then, Sir, if the&s;e things be &s;o, it appears by this Act of A&s;&s;embly that the New-Loans were never an evidence of a money debt but an evidence of a &s;pecial contract to pay the intere&s;t, and the principal and in|tere&s;t to be ultimately paid by the United States.</P>
<P><PB N="507" REF="027132_0515_0FD3283D1A59A6B8">The next con&s;ideration is, that of whatever nature the engagements of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> were, they were done away by the repealing law of March 1789.</P>
<P>All the laws preceding that Act were of a temporary nature, calculated to remove the difficulties of the times, and only to continue until Congre&s;s &s;hould pro|vide, which provi&s;ion was now made, the 27th of March 1789 being the day &s;o long wi&s;hed for, now the tempo|rary relief is withdrawn (Mr. <HI>Wilcocks</HI> read the pream|ble of the Act of 1789) with regard to the private in|tentions of the Legi&s;lature there can be no doubt of their de&s;igns, they could mean nothing le&s;s than the do|ing away all obligations under which they lay by the preceding laws.</P>
<P>Nothing remained but to make the provi&s;ion, which is ab&s;olutely and completely done in the &s;ub&s;equent &s;ec|tions of the Act. In the ca&s;e of two individuals, one of whom is indebted to the other, if a law is pa&s;&s;ed or a circum&s;tance takes place to acquit the debtor from the payment of principal and intere&s;t, can any obligation remain? Is not the debt di&s;charged? How then, is it po&s;&s;ible any thing el&s;e can be meant here, than com|pletely to annul the debt?</P>
<P>The third &s;ection directs the manner in which the ex|change was to have been effected, and when that was done, they had performed all that in ju&s;tice and equity they could be called upon to do.</P>
<P>It was not a contract for the payment of money but only payment of intere&s;t for four years, nothing re|mained but directing the manner of returning the Con|tinental certificates; <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> then had acquitted her&s;elf with honor and character from any engagement &s;he was under from the New-Loan creditors.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that the words <HI>pay</HI> and <HI>&s;ecure</HI> are made u&s;e of at the i&s;&s;uing of the certificates by the law of 1786, which are al&s;o u&s;ed in the repealing Act of March 1789, ju&s;t commen&s;urate to the law of 1786; this preci&s;ion is worthy of attention, it makes the re|peal commen&s;urate to the obligation, and the obliga|tion
<PB N="508" REF="027132_0516_0FD3535B990F5C08">
to be annulled by the u&s;e of tho&s;e words&mdash;meaning <HI>to pay</HI> the intere&s;t, and <HI>to &s;ecure</HI> the return of the Con|tinental certificates; and being u&s;ed in the repealing Act de&s;igned to revoke the pa&s;t.</P>
<P>Whether or not this law was repugnant to the Con&s;ti|tution of the United States, if the above are right, the Con&s;titution need not be attended to, becau&s;e no con|tract was impaired by this commonwealth, the contract being in its origin only conditional. Therefore, Sir, I apprehend the law of 1789 is not to be taken in the defendant's view, but as an Act of the Legi&s;lature of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> intended to do good in the different means pointed out by the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The Con&s;titution of the United States, &s;o far from deviating from, actually concurred with the repealing Act of March 1789 in defeating the obligations of the Act of 1786, and repealed the contract of it&s;elf: Be|cau&s;e the funds were thereby transferred to Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Let us attend to &s;ee in what manner the contract was impaired, if at all. The funds were a part of the contract, as much &s;o as any other. The New-Loan holders a&s;&s;ented to the change, and con&s;ented that the revenues and impo&s;ts &s;hould be taken away from this commonwealth and be for ever ve&s;ted in the United States; the New-Loan holders were repre&s;ented in convention, then that part of the contract was repealed, annulled and made void.</P>
<P>Therefore it may be &s;aid with more truth, that the Con&s;titution repealed the obligation of the Act of 1786, than that the law of 1789 is in violation thereof, and again&s;t the &s;pirit of the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>If then the law of 1786 was not a purcha&s;e of the certificates, but an engagement &s;uch as I have mention|ed, the State is fairly and honorably di&s;charged, and &s;he di&s;engaged her&s;elf by offering the holders the cer|tificates which &s;he had received.</P>
<P>I will now proceed to con&s;ider whether the New-Loans are redeemable under the Act of the 10th of April 1792.</P>
<P><PB N="509" REF="027132_0517_0FD352D79489E770">When we come to con&s;ider that law, we &s;hall pro|bably find that the Legi&s;lature intended to place all the financial engagements of the State on as &s;imple a footing as po&s;&s;ible, by a&s;certaining the <HI>extent</HI> of all her <HI>debts,</HI> and to di&s;charge the mo&s;t of them by <HI>payment,</HI> the means by which this was to be accompli&s;hed was a &s;ale of 3 per cent. &s;tock therein enumerated.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ection directs the payment of intere&s;t on all certificates that bore intere&s;t to the time they be|came due.</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;ection authori&s;es the &s;ale of 3 per cent. &s;tock as much as &s;hould have been nece&s;&s;ary to redeem, 1. All certificates bearing an intere&s;t of 6 per cent. 2. Six per cent. purparts on the deferred &s;tock of the United States. 3. All three per cent. purparts; and 4. Dollar money.</P>
<P>The above &s;ection comprehended every &s;pecies of State debt, the unfunded depreciation and New-Loan debt excepted; the intere&s;t only of the New-Loans was an engagement, and the unfunded depreciation be|ing &s;uppo&s;ed to be in the hands of &s;peculators with a long arrear of intere&s;t, being bought up at a low rate, It was thought it might as well re&s;t to be redeemed at the Land-office.</P>
<P>Let us &s;ee if it is po&s;&s;ible, they ever contemplated the redemption of any other debts than tho&s;e enume|rated in the &s;econd &s;ection.</P>
<P>The third &s;ection provides for the &s;ale of 3 per cent. &s;tock, and giving warrants for its delivery.</P>
<P>The fourth &s;ection directs the Comptroller and Re|gi&s;ter-General to keep the accounts.</P>
<P>The fifth &s;ection provides how they are to be paid on the 1&s;t of July, after due notice be given, and the certificates be depo&s;ited.</P>
<P>In this manner and thus far, it &s;hould &s;eem, ample provi&s;ion had been made to pay off the&s;e &s;tate debts. It was not known at this time that Congre&s;s would ab|&s;olutely open their loan.</P>
<P><PB N="510" REF="027132_0518_0FD352F1D98AE508">Then comes the &s;ixth &s;ection, which we con&s;ider and contend as a provi&s;o, as much as if the Legi&s;lature had &s;aid that you &s;hall at all events have your money, but there is an event which yet may happen, if Congre&s;s &s;hould open their loan, we will impo&s;e an additional duty, that is, that you the holders of certificates &s;ub|cribable to the loan &s;o to be opened, &s;hall not be treated and paid in the manner mentioned in the five foregoing &s;ections, but you &s;hall be obliged to one thing more, namely, &s;ub&s;cribe your certificates to the loan, and transfer them to the State-Trea&s;urer for the u&s;e of the commonwealth, and then you &s;hall receive your pay. The redemptive powers of the 6th &s;ection, were never de&s;igned to exceed tho&s;e in the 2d &s;ection, and was only a different modification upon the event of Congre&s;s opening their loan. <HI>(Mr. Wilcocks then read the 6th &s;ection.)</HI> All the &s;ub&s;equent &s;ections of the law are eventually provi&s;ional, in ca&s;e the price pre|&s;cribed could not be procured for the &s;tock, that the no|tice in the fifth &s;ection be delayed, &amp;c&mdash;I &s;ay every other part of the &s;ections are provi&s;ional.</P>
<P>But, Sir, we are told this 6th &s;ection is an independent clau&s;e, and conceived &s;o exten&s;ive as to oblige the &s;tate to redeem whatever Congre&s;s &s;hould have a&s;&s;umed. Even old bills of credit mu&s;t be paid by the State if Congre&s;s would a&s;&s;ume them. <HI>(Mr. Wilcocks was in|terrupted by Mr. Lewis, who &s;aid, Bills of Credit were not included in the te&s;timony. Mr. Wilcocks repeated that it was given in evidence, as the opinion of the Compt|roller-General, that if old bills of credit were a&s;&s;umed by Congre&s;s, the State would be obliged to redeem them.)</HI></P>
<P>It is a good rule in the con&s;truction of &s;tatutes, to con&s;ider all together, but how much more &s;o in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance of the individual Act of the 10th April 1792, the &s;ixth &s;ection &s;hould not be con&s;idered inde|pendently, but connected with the other &s;ections of the &s;ame Act.</P>
<P>This is plainly and obviou&s;ly militating again&s;t the defendant, and his Coun&s;el; they &s;ay the State commit|ted
<PB N="511" REF="027132_0519_0FD353054BD28128">
her&s;elf to Congre&s;s; this con&s;truction is narrow; the true and ju&s;t con&s;truction is not to enlarge the bounds of redeemability; in that ca&s;e the &s;ixth &s;ection is a provi&s;o to the &s;econd. When two con&s;tructions are brought into view, the one ab&s;urd and incon&s;i&s;tent, the other rational and con&s;i&s;tent, ari&s;ing from a comparative view of the whole Act, no doubt can be entertained which of them will be adopted. Shall a con&s;truction &s;o in&s;ulting to the integrity and under&s;tanding of our Legi&s;lature be courted? To &s;ay, that they would com|mit them&s;elves to Congre&s;s, that they blindly threw them&s;elves into the arms of Congre&s;s, &s;o unre&s;trained, &s;o regardle&s;s of their duty, void of prudence and cau|tion, as to &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;ixth &s;ection was more ex|ten&s;ive than the fir&s;t and &s;econd, as to embrace every de&s;cription of State debts; we will redeem whatever Congre&s;s will a&s;&s;ume!</P>
<P>No Act of Congre&s;s was then extended; it appears an unrea&s;onable and extravagant &s;uppo&s;ition; the idea cannot be admitted on any other ground, but that the Legi&s;lature were remi&s;s, and did not do their duty.</P>
<P>But the law of February 1795&punc; providing for the unfunded depreciation certificates being redeemed, &s;hews they con&s;idered nothing redeemable but what the &s;econd &s;ection compri&s;ed. <HI>(Mr. Lewis a&s;ked Mr. Wil|cocks, Do you produce a legi&s;lative con&s;truction after the fact happened, as a proof where many of the unfunded de|preciation certificates were redeemed? Mr. Wilcocks &s;aid he meant to &s;hew the &s;en&s;e of the Legi&s;lature, that by this law of 1793, their &s;en&s;e of the law of</HI> 1792 <HI>was to ex|clude the unfunded depreciation; therefore the New-Loans could not be included.)</HI></P>
<P>It therefore appears that New-Loan certificates were di&s;carded by <HI>Penn&s;ylvania;</HI> the State had acquitted her|&s;elf; the arrears of intere&s;t on them were to be paid; con|&s;equently, it is impo&s;&s;ible that New-Loans could be re|deemed by the Act of 1792, when in 1793 &s;he declared that even unfunded depreciation certificates were not contemplated to be redeemable by the Act of 1792.</P>
<P><PB N="512" REF="027132_0520_0FD3535CFB11B058">Hence, then, Sir, I tru&s;t it appears evident, 1. That New-Loans never were a State money debt, at all. 2. That they were never &s;ub&s;cribable, and 3. That they were never redeemable.</P>

<HEAD><HI>FOURTH ARTICLE</HI>&mdash; A violation of the Con&s;titution.</HEAD>
<P>But &s;ay the learned Coun&s;el for the defendant, there were ways and means, there is a fund for the redemp|tion of the New-Loan debt, under the heads of <HI>claims</HI> and <HI>improvements,</HI> by the act of the 7th of April 1791. By this, &s;ay the gentlemen, it is provided "to pay all warrants hereafter to be drawn for <HI>claims</HI> and <HI>improve|ments</HI> by virtue of any law or laws of this common|wealth." This appears to me one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular ideas that hath been &s;tarted in the whole cour&s;e of this mo&s;t important cau&s;e; 1. If it was liable for the New-Loan debt, &s;till this fund was not named, the Compt|roller did not draw out of this fund, but out of the fund created by the &s;ale of 3 per cent. &s;tock under the act of April 10th, 1792. Therefore this argument and the certifications of the Comptroller-General, mu&s;t be diametrically oppo&s;ite. This &s;eems oppo&s;ite to the knowledge of every per&s;on who is any ways conver&s;ant in legi&s;lative appropriations.</P>
<P>This fund was a few years before limited to &pound;. 10,000, and therefore in&s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e; it is true, by the act of the 7th of April 1791, the limitation is taken away, and makes it the la&s;t appropriation; every other obligation is done away, but &s;till holds with equal force, yet &s;till the fir&s;t act &s;hews their idea of its probable amount, out of this claim Mr. <HI>Rittenhou&s;e</HI> and others, were paid, for &s;urveying the <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> road. I appre|hend the idea of the Legi&s;lature was to make it a fund on which the Legi&s;lature might draw, but not to be drawn on, at the di&s;cretion of the Governor or other of|ficers. Then there is a nece&s;&s;ity for an order of the Le|gi&s;lature
<PB N="513" REF="027132_0521_0FD3283E98DB1150">
that that fund be drawn on, otherwi&s;e there would be no occa&s;ion for any appropriations at all, this would be a general &s;ub&s;i&s;ting fund, and would an&s;wer all demands without any &s;pecific appropriations.</P>
<P>That my con&s;truction of the act is a rea&s;onable one, and their con&s;truction unrea&s;onable, I will mention the Act of the 4th April 1792, which directs certificates to be granted for &s;ettled demands without intere&s;t, but no warrants &s;hould i&s;&s;ue, only reports to be made of them to the Legi&s;lature of the number of unprovided debts without fund for payment; where was the nece&s;&s;ity of this act, where was the nece&s;&s;ity of reporting, to the Le|gi&s;lature, if the funds for <HI>claims</HI> and <HI>improvements</HI> were to an&s;wer all claims and demands without any further order from the Legi&s;lature?</P>

<P>HAVING arrived at the con&s;ideration of that point of this bu&s;ine&s;s, which re&s;pects the criminal motives and intention of the Comptroller-General, and although it is alledged that the conduct of that officer, is not wrong in certifying the &s;ub&s;cribability and redeemabi|lity of New-Loan certificates, and effecting their re|demption under the act of Congre&s;s and law of the 10th April 1792; and that his opinion and judgment are in|nocent, and he is not re&s;pon&s;ible in a criminal point of view.</P>
<P>The&s;e pleas will be inadmi&s;&s;ible, when weighed with all the circum&s;tances attending this tran&s;action, con|&s;ider his &s;entiments, and his opinion on this &s;ubject, how extremely cautious he has been in promulgating his opi|nion; con&s;ider, whether he acted in his official charac|ter, and directly contrary to the intentions of the Le|gi&s;lature of his country; let us examine whether he is criminal or innocent, let us attend to the time when he wrote on this &s;ubject, what circum&s;tances may favour his intentions, and &s;ee whether there are &s;ufficient and rea&s;onable grounds for acquitting him, deliberate well whether his judgment was uninfluenced; if it is po&s;&s;i|ble to &s;uppo&s;e he really did believe that New-Loans were a&s;&s;umable and redeemable. Connected with all

the&s;e circum&s;tances, it is to be called an ob&s;tinate per|ver&s;e opinion, and can &s;erve as no excu&s;e or apology. His former opinion, although much relied on, mu&s;t have been formed from private views, he &s;hould have taken advice.</P>
<P>I will recapitulate all the circum&s;tances in his favour, and tho&s;e again&s;t him, and place them in one point of view. It ha&s; been much relied on, and is worthy of ob&s;ervation, that his opinion of the &s;ub&s;cribability of New-Loans was long before the pa&s;&s;ing of the act of the 10th of April 1792.</P>
<P>In his letter to <HI>Thomas Smith</HI> (page 271-2) he writes,</P>
<P>"It is not pre&s;umable the <HI>New-Loans</HI> will be offered."</P>
<P>In his letter to the Governor (page 220-1-2) he writes, "I think too highly of the faith of the public," &amp;c. It is true, he did &s;o, but this declaration was un|nece&s;&s;ary, being made at a time when it was connected with the &s;ubject of difficulty, namely, that of withhold|ing the payment of intere&s;t, in five days afterwards (&s;ee letter page 277) it was found New-Loans were not &s;ub|&s;cribed, all the difficulty was over, con&s;equently the Governor did not an&s;wer that letter, nor took any no|tice of the opinion.</P>
<P>In another letter (page 223) he &s;tates the conference and &s;hews his opinion that New-Loans were &s;ub&s;criba|ble; true, and it is equally true, that the conference was founded on an idea, that New-Loans were &s;ub|&s;cribable.</P>
<P>The&s;e are all that are given in te&s;timony that the Comptroller thought the New-Loans were &s;ub&s;cribable.</P>
<P>The Governor did not care about the &s;entiment, he was for another thing, he directed the Comptroller-Ge|neral to confer with the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, in|&s;tead of &s;tating to him in an open and candid manner, he only &s;ends him a New-Loan certificate, and the law of 1786, under which they were i&s;&s;ued, and withheld the repealing law of 1789, which would have removed every difficulty as appears from his la&s;t letters; we find that the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury did not know the law
<PB N="516" REF="027132_0524_0FD353394C7D9220">
of 1789, but as &s;oon as that officer knew that the law of 1786 was completely and fully repealed, that mo|ment every difficulty vani&s;hed.</P>
<P>But the gentlemen &s;ay, he not only held the opinion, that the New-Loans were &s;ub&s;cribable, but al&s;o that they were redeemable under the Act of 1792. I reque&s;t the attention of the Senate in di&s;tingui&s;hing the par|ticular periods to which this evidence points, as it is of the utmo&s;t importance to determine the degree of innocence or criminality.</P>
<P>After the month of February 1792 we find no inti|mation of his opinion, that the New-Loans were re|deemable or even a&s;&s;umable.</P>
<P>It hath been &s;aid, that with regard to the Act of the 10th April 1792, the Comptroller expected the words there made u&s;e of would include New-Loans: I pre|&s;ume this was the rea&s;on of his objection, and oppo&s;i|tion to the pa&s;&s;ing of that law.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Griffith Evans</HI> had no other authority for his conver&s;ation, that the Act of April 1792 would include New-Loans, than the declaration and opinion of the Comptroller-General on this head (&s;ee page 306) who told him he had been endeavouring to convince Mr. <HI>Gallatin,</HI> that if old bills of credit were a&s;&s;umed, they mu&s;t be redeemed; Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed out of the office, it re&s;ts on Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on's</HI> veracity, Mr. <HI>Gal|latin</HI> was either gone or did not hear this, but he un|equivocally denies the conver&s;ation; with re&s;pect to the unfunded depreciation, Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed that to be included, and thought it immaterial whether they were redeemed that way, or through the Land-office. (&s;ee page 296.)</P>
<P>Again: It is &s;aid, that he &s;ub&s;cribed New-Loans openly &s;o as to hazard detection and di&s;grace. <HI>An&s;wer.</HI> Not &s;o very openly, as facts and events will &s;hew, he did not communicate his opinion to any other officer, his opinion was &s;ingular indeed; his conduct was more &s;ecret than open, the mo&s;t intelligent brokers and others had no idea of their &s;ub&s;cribability.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="027132_0525_0FD3535E885EAB70">The arrangement of the bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;uch, that no officer of the government &s;aw the certificates intended to be loaned but the Comptroller-General. No man could &s;ee what he was doing, and yet the&s;e are the ar|guments adduced to &s;hew the innocence of the Compt|roller-General, re&s;pecting his opinion of the &s;ub&s;crib|ability and redeemability of New-Loan certificates!</P>
<P>It will be nece&s;&s;ary in this place to recapitulate all the circum&s;tances, which came within his knowledge in direct oppo&s;ition to this opinion.</P>
<P>The Comptroller-General mu&s;t have known, that the Act of March 1789 repealed all the obligations of the State re&s;pecting New-Loans. He mu&s;t have known that his opinion was wrong at lea&s;t, as he was acting in direct oppo&s;ition to an expre&s;s law.</P>
<P>The Comptroller-General &s;ays, New-Loans are a State debt. They are not &s;o, &s;ays the Legi&s;lature; he in&s;i&s;ts upon it that they are; nay, &s;ub&s;cribable and re|deemable too! Every department of government con&s;i|dered them as no longer having an exi&s;tence; but the Comptroller-General in defiance of the Legi&s;lature, per&s;i&s;ts on their exi&s;tence as a State debt! The Gover|nor in his communications to the Legi&s;lature, referred to all the debts and engagements of the commonwealth, but omits New-Loans among the debts, and when he mentions them, he only adverts to the arrears of inter|e&s;t due on the New-Loan debt.</P>
<P>The committees of ways and means officially re|ported in like manner. His own and the Regi&s;ter-Ge|neral's &s;tatements were made in the &s;ame manner. The Legi&s;lature them&s;elves had by a parliamentary declara|tion provided for the payment of the balance of intere&s;t on bills of credit; this &s;hews, that in doing &s;o, they acquitted them&s;elves of all their obligations as to New-Loans; and by providing for the intere&s;t they had abandoned the debt.</P>
<P>The people, the citizens of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> con&s;idered the repealing Act as a good and valid law, and &s;ub|mitted to it; and in conformity to it, and at the call of
<PB N="518" REF="027132_0526_0FD3533C12230160">
the State came forward and out of &pound;.1,819,415:18:9, they had exchanged all under it but about &pound;. 50,000 as appears by his letter (page 220-1-2.)</P>
<P>And &s;hall the Comptroller-General, an officer of high tru&s;t under the commonwealth, with all this knowledge and information in his own brea&s;t, pretend to &s;ay "I am innocent?" Shall he excu&s;e and ju&s;tify this, by &s;hewing, that, he thought the year before, that the New-Loan certificates were a&s;&s;umable, &s;ub&s;cribable and redeemable? Is it rea&s;onable, or can we &s;uppo&s;e after all this information in the Comptroller's own know|ledge and brea&s;t, that he could entertain an hone&s;t opi|nion under all the&s;e circum&s;tances, and in direct op|po&s;ition to all this great body of information, that the New-Loans were &s;ub&s;cribable and redeemable? I &s;ay, in oppo&s;ition to the &s;entiments of the Governor, the Legi&s;lature, the committees on ways and means, and all the officers of government.</P>
<P>It appears to me, that if this opinion ever exi&s;ted, it mu&s;t have been formed opon principles of ob&s;tinacy and perver&s;ene&s;s, adhered to again&s;t the dictates of rea&s;on and good &s;en&s;e, and not agreeable to the better light and information of a well informed mind.</P>
<P>If, then, Sir, &s;uch an affected opinion can be form|ed and acted upon, in violation of law; nay, admitted, as a ju&s;tification and apology; where &s;hall we find of|ficial duty, honour or integrity?</P>
<P>There is another circum&s;tance in this ca&s;e wor|thy of con&s;ideration, that, in point of time; all evi|dences are prior to the pa&s;&s;ing of the Act of the 10th April 1792. He never communicated to any of the official characters of the State that the Act of April 1792 would include New-Loans. What are the cir|cum&s;tances re&s;pecting his interviews with the gentle|men of the Senate and Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives? He was oppo&s;ed to the pa&s;&s;ing of that law! He &s;aid it would be injurious to the State! What were the objects of the&s;e communications! Undoubtedly they were for for &s;ome con&s;ideration! When the law was about to
<PB N="519" REF="027132_0527_0FD353600A92B5F8">
pa&s;s, we find him ha&s;tening from one public character to another. In general, we find him manife&s;ting great zeal for the intere&s;t of the State, as this Act would be injurious to her intere&s;t.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time we find him manife&s;ting equal zeal for his own plan of finance, to help it to go down; many of the witne&s;&s;es do not remember his objections, yet no man approved of his plan. What were his ob|jections to the bill? They are of a very trivial nature&mdash; 1. <HI>The price too high!</HI> 2. <HI>Ordering all the</HI> 3 <HI>per cent. &s;tock to be &s;old at once,</HI> &amp;c. I appeal to you, if the&s;e objections were not perfectly nugatory. He urged his plan of finance with all po&s;&s;ible warmth: If I under|&s;tand his plan right, its object was not to pay off any of the debts of the commonwealth, but to fund them, and New-Loans among&s;t the re&s;t.</P>
<P>I infer from this &s;pecies of oppo&s;ition to the one, and zeal to &s;upport the other, that the Senate will judge the motives; in all the&s;e conver&s;ations hath he di&s;clo&s;|ed to any of tho&s;e members whom he con&s;ulted, that the bill might injure the public, or does he produce any means whereby the commonwealth might not be hurt? Has he mentioned to any per&s;on that any debts were a&s;&s;umable and redeemable under the &s;ixth &s;ection, other than tho&s;e &s;pecified in the &s;econd &s;ection? Certainly not.</P>
<P>If motives of public duty induced him to oppo&s;e the law of April 1792, if he &s;aw that individuals would &s;peculate to the di&s;advantage of the State, why did he not &s;ays &s;o? Does not all this &s;tir in favour of his own plan, and again&s;t the bill, &s;hew that it was not for the good of the State? and becau&s;e he liked his own plan of finance better.</P>
<P>Further, in a conver&s;ation with Mr. <HI>Gallatin, Galla|tin</HI> warned him that his opinion was contrary to that of the Ligi&s;lature, and expre&s;sly informed him, that al|though unfunded depreciation might be redeemed un|der the &s;ixth &s;ection, yet he &s;aid it was not &s;o intended. <HI>(Mr. Morris, the Speaker of the Senate, ob&s;erved, that
<PB N="520" REF="027132_0528_0FD353617A228D98">
agreeably to his notes, the Comptroller had &s;aid, accord|ing to the te&s;timony of Mr. Thomas (page</HI> 287<HI>) "The bill as it &s;tood would admit of con&s;tructions that would open a door for &s;peculation," and "that &s;ome individu|als would take advantage to the lo&s;s of the State," ac|cording to the te&s;timony of Mr. Montgomery (page</HI> 290.)</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wilcocks</HI> proceeded, and &s;aid (addre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf to the Speaker) you have altered my recollection. Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> made this ob&s;ervation on the Act, and yet he (Mr. <HI>Gallatin)</HI> allowed unfunded depreciation certificates were redeemable under the &s;ixth &s;ection of that law.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, and it is true, that <HI>Gallatin's</HI> opinion was not to be pur&s;ued, nor admitted as the true con|&s;truction in oppo&s;ition to the <HI>words of the law.</HI> It is evident from the information of Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> to the Comptroller-General that he knew the &s;en&s;e of the Le|gi&s;lature, and that New-Loans were neither &s;ub&s;crib|able nor redeemable, nor embraced under that law; he &s;hould therefore have he&s;itated and applied to the Governor for advice and have con&s;ulted legal charact|ers for official explanation.</P>
<P>Had he done this, how ea&s;y would it be to prevent the &s;ub&s;cription of the&s;e New-Loans, and &s;ub&s;equent lo&s;s to the State; it ought, at lea&s;t, to have excited &s;ome doubt, and to have procured the Governor's opi|nion, and if nece&s;&s;ary, the Attorney-General's explana|tion.</P>
<P>But in order to conduct his &s;peculation with &s;ucce&s;s, he di&s;regards all Mr. <HI>Gallatin's</HI> ob&s;ervations, he did not, as his duty required of him, apply to the Governor, he not only neglected to do this but he proceeded in a manner to deceive the Governor.</P>
<P>When the Governor called for a &s;tatement of the 3 per cent. &s;tock to be &s;old and of the debts to be re|deemed under the Act of the 10th of April 1792, the Comptroller rendered only tho&s;e redeemable under the &s;econd &s;ection, and to keep his tran&s;actions further con|cealed,
<PB N="521" REF="027132_0529_0FD35366132152D8">
he does not &s;pecify New-Loans in his certificate to the Governor as one of them.</P>
<P>But &s;ay they, How could he do it, the loan of Con|gre&s;s was not then open? Poor excu&s;e! he was not a&s;k|ed for a &s;tatement under a particular &s;ection of the Act, the call was general and extended to the whole law. (Mr. <HI>Lewis</HI> a&s;ked for the letter alluded to, calling for the &s;tatement. Mr. <HI>Morgan</HI> went for the letter into the Secretary's office (&s;ee page 232) which being read, and not an&s;wering the ideas of Mr. <HI>Wilcocks</HI> re&s;pecting the <HI>general call,</HI> for the letter called for no &s;tatement; Mr. <HI>Wilcocks</HI> &s;aid, that Mr. <HI>Dallas</HI> in his te&s;timony declar|ed that the call was general. This a&s;&s;ertion was an|&s;wered by Mr. <HI>Lewis</HI> with no! no!!</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wilcocks</HI> then proceeded,&mdash;La&s;tly, we find the certificate to the Governor was not explicit enough to have decided what debt was to have been redeemed. The New-Loans might have been &s;ub&s;cribable, yet not <HI>redeemable,</HI> as we contend that <HI>&s;ub&s;cribable</HI> and <HI>redeem|able</HI> were not convertible terms: After all it mu&s;t be &s;ubmitted to the Senate, whether they were &s;ub&s;crib|able, and if &s;o, whether they were redeemable. I &s;hall now di&s;mi&s;s this head, and proceed to the</P>
<DIV3 N="5,6" TYPE="articles">
<HEAD>FIFTH AND SIXTH ARTICLES.</HEAD>
<P>By the fifth article, the Comptroller-General is charg|ed with purcha&s;ing New-Loan certificates from tho&s;e who came to his office for the purpo&s;e of exchanging them.</P>
<P>In the &s;ixth article he is charged with taking mea|&s;ures in his private capacity for preventing the re-ex|change of New-Loan certificates after they had been depo&s;ited with him.</P>
<P>We are now arrived at that part of the &s;ubject, which is free from embarra&s;&s;ing con&s;tructions, we may now even for the pre&s;ent admit that they were &s;ub&s;cribable and redeemable. Here it is not nece&s;&s;ary to po&s;&s;e&s;s the abilities of a lawyer. The&s;e la&s;t articles depend upon the principles of MORALITY and PRUDENCE! the degree
<PB N="522" REF="027132_0530_0FD35369834328C8">
of guilt will depend upon the intent. Has the Compt|roller-General acted with rectitude and propriety of in|tention? Has he acquitted him&s;elf of the duties which other laws impo&s;ed on him, or not?</P>
<P>The&s;e charges do not depend on the violation of Acts of A&s;&s;embly, or Legi&s;lative Statutes, but they depend on moral principles interwoven with the common law as applied to all official characters. The crime is di&s;|covered by fir&s;t a&s;certaining the duty of the Comptrol|ler-General, and by examining, whether he has acted in oppo&s;ition to that duty. If he has acted again&s;t it, he is guilty, the degree of guilt is determined by cir|cum&s;tances. The wrong, if done, the wilfulne&s;s, mo|tives and inducements of the doer of the wrong, and the degree of criminality, will depend on circum&s;tances of aggravation or extenuation. That he is guilty in &s;ome degree or other, appears from a conviction that he hath violated the&s;e principles of integrity, morality and prudence, in the execution of his official obliga|tions. This will be evident from the te&s;timony of Mr. <HI>Biddle</HI> and <HI>Son,</HI> and Mr. <HI>John Oldden.</HI></P>
<P>It is in evidence that young Mr. <HI>Biddle</HI> depo&s;ited a certificate agreeably to Act of A&s;&s;embly, and a printed exchange was filled up. In the in&s;tance of <HI>Oldden</HI> he rendered his certificates for re-exchange, went home, was de&s;ired to call again the next day; in the evening the Comptroller-General wrote to him, offering him the a&s;&s;umable value, <HI>Oldden</HI> being a little &s;truck with the offer, &s;uppo&s;ed they mu&s;t have been of &s;ome advan|tage to him, came up to his office, the Continental cer|tificates were not yet ready; he came up again the next day, &s;till the exchanges were not ready; he told the Comptroller, "give me thirty dollars and their nomi|nal value, and you &s;hall have them."</P>
<P>Is this conduct right or wrong? Where is honor, where is integrity, where is uprightne&s;s or equity? Is this conduct reconcilable with the principles of duty, prudence and official agency? The council for the de|fendant
<PB N="523" REF="027132_0531_0FD3536B96BD6D28">
have laboured to &s;hew that the Act of March 1789, was void, as operating again&s;t the Con&s;titution of the United States. Let it be admitted, yet it can|not be pretended that that part of the Act is void, which directs the Comptroller-General to exchange the Continental certificates for the New-Loans, many may be de&s;irous, is an expre&s;&s;ion much relied on by them, and is cited from the law; with this plain direction <HI>"well and faithfully to do his duty,"</HI> under the &s;anction of an oath to act hone&s;tly and uprightly towards the Commonwealth, he is directed by the Act of March 1789 to exchange when required. Yet he &s;teps from his &s;tation, and purcha&s;es <HI>in</HI> the New-Loans.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, under an oath well and faithfully to execute his office, what does he do? The&s;e Gentlemen came forward and offered their certificates for exchange, and depo&s;ited them for that purpo&s;e, he receives them, ap|points a time for the purpo&s;e of exchanging them, we find him &s;tepping forward, offering to purcha&s;e, nay, actually purcha&s;ing the &s;ame certificates.</P>
<P>Surely, Sir, this is an high mi&s;demeanor, if any &s;uch thing as mi&s;demeanor can be found any where; although it is mentioned in the articles that New-Loans on depo|&s;it, became the property of the State, this is not the git of the charge, but only a circum&s;tance of aggravation.</P>
<P>The charge is, his preventing the execution of the act, and heightening the offence by purcha&s;ing the cer|tificates, defeating the law, and &s;peculating on them to his own great gain, and to the lo&s;s of the commonwealth. I repeat it, Sir, it is mentioned here only as a circum|&s;tance; but I will now &s;ay, that when the certificates were depo&s;ited; they became the property of the com|monwealth, and the con&s;equence was that &s;he had a pro|perty in them, and no body had a right to return them.</P>
<P>It is evidently and manife&s;tly proved, that the certi|ficates were in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the commonwealth; the State had a property in them. Who had the authority to &s;urrender the Continental certificates for them? The Legi&s;lature &s;poke by its laws directing the exchange
<PB N="524" REF="027132_0532_0FD352F34F5C6B38">
to be done. It was wrong in the Comptroller-General to do it in any in&s;tance; but we do not come forward to impeach him for merely returning the certificates when he had no intere&s;t him&s;elf. It was the intere&s;t which he held in the&s;e certificates, every &s;uch intere&s;t mu&s;t be connected with corre&s;pondent property. The State had a property, and &s;he gave no power to any per&s;on to take it from her.</P>
<P>I beg the attention of the Senate to the recollection of the ideas of property, we know that bare po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion gives a property in ca&s;es of larceny.</P>
<P>When the certificates were in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they were in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the State, and not in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>John Nichol&s;on:</HI> occupancy gives a right. A hor&s;e lo&s;t or &s;tolen from one man, and found in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another, leather from a &s;hoemaker, or cloth from a taylor; the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any of the&s;e articles is enough, the indictment is always for the property.</P>
<P>Here, Sir, the commonwealth had an intere&s;t and a property: The gentlemen once made a conce&s;&s;ion, that no exchange was completed until the indents were ten|dered. I rather think Mr. <HI>Oldden</HI> had no indents to pay, con&s;equently the balance was due to him, and Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> repaid it; of cour&s;e the State had them to pay, therefore the exchange &s;hould be completed when the certificates were offered.</P>
<P>I apprehend then that this was a mo&s;t unwarrantable and unju&s;tifiable proceeding in the Comptroller-Gene|ral, to &s;tep forward to take this property which belong|ed to the commonwealth, and purcha&s;e them.</P>
<P>The Gentleman who &s;poke la&s;t, &s;aid, that <HI>Penn&s;ylva|nia</HI> had not yet decided, how far &s;he &s;hould re&s;train the public officers from dealing; he mentioned that a law was pa&s;&s;ed prohibiting vendue ma&s;ters to purcha&s;e at their <HI>own &s;ales,</HI> that the General Government prevented the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury and the clerks in his of|fice from &s;peculating in the funds, but that no law ex|i&s;ted to prevent the Camptroller-General from dealing in this &s;pecies of property! We do not bring a charge

again&s;t the defendant for purcha&s;ing certificates through the medium of brokers, or dealing in &s;tock, but only in violating his tru&s;t in the foregoing in&s;tances.

<HEAD>SEVENTH ARTICLE.</HEAD>
<P>The la&s;t article charges the Comptroller-General, that after the exchange was actually completed, he &s;ub|&s;cribed a New-Loan certificate for thirty-two hundred odd pounds, in his own name, and had it redeemed at the Trea&s;ury, and received the money for it.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of this certificate is, that Mr. <HI>M'Connell</HI> was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it on the 30th March 1790, that it was i&s;&s;ued in his own name for &pound;. 3275:19:4&mdash;that he delivered it on that day to <HI>Blair M'Clenachan</HI> (Mr. <HI>Morris</HI> the Speaker interrupted Mr. <HI>Wilcocks</HI> here and &s;aid, the entry was made on the 6th of March, and not on the 30th.) He entered it at the Trea&s;ury on the 6th of March 1790, and received intere&s;t in September 1790, from the Trea&s;ury. Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> &s;wears that when he went to the Comptroller's office to exchange his certificates, he carried ALL his certificates with him, and received the corre&s;ponding Continental certificates in exchange. He &s;wears unequivocally, that he never &s;old or commuted any certificates with the Comptroller-General in his life. It appears, the Comptroller &s;ub|&s;cribed this identical certificate.</P>
<P>If the&s;e facts are true, I forbear to make any further animadver&s;ions on them! It hath been attempted to rai&s;e doubts re&s;pecting the witne&s;s who &s;upports this charge, his veracity and integrity hath not been im|peached but his memory.</P>
<P>His depo&s;ition hath been treated in &s;uch a manner, as no human te&s;timony could &s;tand the te&s;t. The Gen|tleman did not read the interrogatories and an&s;wers throughout. I cannot tell what evidence could &s;tand &s;uch &s;crutiny.</P>
<P><PB N="526" REF="027132_0534_0FD328431C37C910">It appears Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> &s;wears with caution, and that he is not inimical to the defendant; he &s;wears with certainty where his memory &s;erves him, where he could refer to unerring documents, he did &s;o; where he was uncertain, he doubted! (Mr. <HI>Wilcocks</HI> then read the interrogatories and an&s;wers, and commented on them, &s;ee page 253 to 260.)</P>
<P>His refu&s;al to an&s;wer four interrogatories will be ex|cu&s;ed, when their nature is con&s;idered, &s;ome of them look as if calculated to affront him (18th and 19th read) Sir, <HI>his feelings were hurt,</HI> it excited his re&s;ent|ment (20th read) perhaps he thought it implied &s;ome &s;u&s;picions not very honorable (21&s;t read.) None of the&s;e contains a que&s;tion calculated to draw an an&s;wer material to the enquiry about the certificate, about which the enquiry was made: which induced him to &s;ay they <HI>"did not de&s;erve an an&s;wer,"</HI> it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed they were calculated to confu&s;e and irritate him.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> &s;wears he never commuted with <HI>John Nichol&s;on,</HI> This certificate is &s;ub&s;cribed by Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> &s;ub&s;cribed all his certifi|cates. Where is there any room for any other conclu|&s;ion, but that Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> had exchanged it. The evidence under this la&s;t charge is &s;triking and conclu&s;ive; if there was a doubt, what can be ea&s;ier than for the Comptroller to bring forward information where he got it? If his brokers bought it, they have a bill, they al|ways keep an account.</P>
<P>Is it of &s;uch a nature, and <HI>&s;o trivial,</HI> as to merit no attention? A certificate for three thou&s;and odd hun|dred pounds! Or is it &s;o <HI>conclu&s;ive</HI> as to de&s;erve no an|&s;wer? No attempt is made to &s;hew it came otherwi&s;e into the hands of Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>His books of exchange are &s;o irregularly kept, as that it is impo&s;&s;ible to get any thing from them: They are not kept agreeably to the directions of Council, nor at the proper times. It is not to be pretended that the books can be balanced day by day, but it may rea|&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed, that when the exchanges are com|pleted,

then things might be known; the&s;e exchanges exhibit no receipts; they are not in the hand-writing of the party; you find only the initials of their names.

<P>Mr. <HI>LEWIS</HI> &s;poke as follows&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Senate,</HI></P>
<P>THE defendant &s;tands impeached on &s;even articles of high crimes and mi&s;demeanors in his official capa|city as Comptroller-General of this commonwealth. The Repre&s;entatives of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> have pledged them|&s;elves to make good their charges, and to add counte|nance and influence to their pro&s;ecution, they have at a very great expence to the commonwealth, abandoned their duties el&s;e where to pay daily attendance here. To di&s;appoint them in their favourite object and to defend him, is the occa&s;ion of my troubling you at pre&s;ent. It is to be regretted that my indi&s;po&s;ition will prevent me from rendering him that ju&s;tice to which I deem him entitled: But it is no &s;mall con&s;olation to me that I have been preceded by able colleagues, and if I had not yet that I appear before impartial judges who will be no le&s;s able than willing to render him ample ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>I have always thought that Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> was po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of too many and too exten&s;ive powers to be en|tru&s;ted to any man, and if the que&s;tion at pre&s;ent turn|ed upon this, I &s;hould have been far from advocating their propriety. If this was wrong it was not however his fault, but it re&s;ted with tho&s;e who thought proper to entru&s;t them to him, with &s;o few checks or means
<PB N="529" REF="027132_0537_0FD3284641655878">
of controul. I cannot however but con&s;ider this as the real grounds of accu&s;ation, and to lament how degrad|ing it is to human nature, that &s;he affords &s;o many in|&s;tances of men high in popular favour, becoming en|vied, &s;u&s;pected, per&s;ecuted, hunted down and ruined, &s;o that the old adage of <HI>ho&s;annah</HI> to day and <HI>crucify</HI> him to-morrow, is not yet out of date.</P>
<P>As the doctrine which I have advanced with re&s;pect to exten&s;ive powers entru&s;ted to an individual applies to the <HI>accu&s;ed,</HI> there &s;eems to be an exception to the general rule, and my mind is much changed, &s;ince I have &s;een a mountain &s;o long in labour without even producing a <HI>mou&s;e.</HI> The keen-eyed and quick &s;cented committee of inve&s;tigation, of hunters and of inform|ers, who have probed every channel of information, and &s;earched every corner for intelligence, have with unwearied indu&s;try traced all the uncounted millions and tens of millions with which he had been entru&s;ted, and it now appears that THE TEMPTATIONS HOWEVER GREAT COULD NOT CORRUPT HIM &s;ince nothing has been found again&s;t him except with re&s;pect to the New-Loan certificates. Hence I am induced to believe that the public confidence was not mi&s;placed. Months of laborious indu&s;try have been employed by a committee con&s;tantly &s;itting during the rece&s;s of the Hou&s;e, with free acce&s;s to his books, papers and official documents, and yet they have been able to bring forward nothing el&s;e again&s;t him. He has undergone this fiery ordeal of more than inqui&s;itorial per&s;ecution; and if he &s;hall not be found guilty, his character mu&s;t, like pure me|tal doubly refined by an over &s;evere heat, appear with unexampled lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>The charges are of the mo&s;t &s;erious nature;&mdash;wilful and corrupt violation of the law! wilful and corrupt di&s;regard of official duty! wilful and corrupt violation of his oath! and all this from motives of private gain and &s;ordid lucre! and all this too, at the ex|pence of the public who had confided in him! If all the&s;e things are true, an unanimous vote of condemna|tion
<PB N="530" REF="027132_0538_0FD32846E5125370">
ought to take place, but if they are unfounded, an unanimous acquittal &s;hould be the re&s;ult.</P>
<P>The accu&s;ed labours under di&s;advantages which even common culprits do not experience. In ordinary ca&s;es an unanimous voice is nece&s;&s;ary to a conviction; not &s;o with re&s;pect to him, and therefore more than ordi|nary proofs &s;hould be required. Again, Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">harged and boldly too, with a violation of his oath of office. On this ground too, the mo&s;t conclu&s;ive evidence &s;hould be required. On an indictment for perjury two witne&s;&s;es are nece&s;&s;ary to a conviction, be|cau&s;e where there is but one oath of guilt, there is oath again&s;t oath, and truth hangs in an equilibrium. 10th <HI>Mod.</HI> 194.4 <HI>Blac.</HI> Comm. 351. This principle is &s;urely applicable upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, where the defendant is charged with a violation of his oath of office, and it will be found that this charge is at mo&s;t &s;upported by the treacherous and confu&s;ed memory of Mr. <HI>Blair M'Clenachan.</HI></P>
<P>We are told, Mr. Speaker, that this pro&s;ecution me|rits peculiar attention from the re&s;pectability of the accu&s;ers, and a line of di&s;tinction favourable to them has been drawn, between an impeachment and a pre|&s;entment by a grand jury. Of this re&s;pectability and of the propriety of this line of di&s;tinction we have not however any proof, nor am I at all &s;atisfied with it. In public bodies heat too frequently takes place, and pa&s;|&s;ion too often bears &s;way. When that is the ca&s;e, the judgment is too often warped, and the innocent not un|frequently fall victims to the rage of party. This is not the ca&s;e in pre&s;entments by grand juries. <HI>There,</HI> generally &s;peaking, the accu&s;ed meets his accu&s;er face to face before the magi&s;trate. They meet on equal grounds, the allegations again&s;t him are heard and he has an opportunity of vindicating his innocence. This palladium of &s;acred rights is it is true but &s;eldom refu&s;ed in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hou&s;e of Commons; where it is not un|frequent for the party accu&s;ed to be heard at the bar previous to the articles of impeachment being voted
<PB N="531" REF="027132_0539_0FD3531FF2146B58">
again&s;t him. The &s;ame indulgence (if an indulgence it is to be called) was upon a late occa&s;ion afforded to Judge <HI>Hopkin&s;on,</HI> and had the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives been worthy of that re&s;pectability which the learned managers have been plea&s;ed to impute to them, I can|not but think, that the &s;ame mea&s;ure of ju&s;tice would have been meted to Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on:</HI> I neverthele&s;s tru&s;t that clothed as he is with con&s;cious innocence and &s;hield|ed with that coat of armour which truth and virtue never fail to afford, he will be able to baffle the views of his <HI>re&s;pectable</HI> but heated and mi&s;guided accu&s;ers.</P>
<P>We have been in&s;tructed, Mr. Speaker, by a long and laboured, though rather clum&s;y account of the ri&s;e, progre&s;s and <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of impeachments in <HI>England,</HI> and we are told that they are intended to prevent great and mighty offenders from e&s;caping puni&s;hment for fla|gitious crimes by an over-bearing influence. How|ever true this may be, I cannot &s;ee any nece&s;&s;ity for its di&s;cu&s;&s;ion here. Our own con&s;titution and our own laws have erected ramparts of &s;afe-guard round the in|nocent, while they have provided means of cha&s;ti&s;e|ment for the guilty, and to them only &s;hould our ap|peal be made. By the eighth &s;ection of the ninth ar|ticle of our Con&s;titution, it is provided that "no war|rant &s;hall i&s;&s;ue to &s;eize any per&s;on without probable cau&s;e &s;upported by oath or affirmation;" and the mo&s;t &s;olemn oath is required from every grand juror in order to prevent pre&s;entments of the innocent, or the crimes of the guilty from pa&s;&s;ing unpuni&s;hed. In monarchical governments where the royal favour leads to a di&s;tinc|tion of ranks, the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for impeachments may perhaps be a ju&s;t one, but in a republican go|vernment where no &s;uch di&s;tinction prevails, it is as different as a beggar in his cottage wrapped in his rags can po&s;&s;ibly be from a monarch on his throne with his diadem &s;parkling upon his brow. Here the law is &s;u|preme&mdash;it neither admits nor knows of any influence in its admini&s;tration; an admini&s;tration which is too pure to oppre&s;s the poor, or to &s;creen the rich; to cha|&s;ti&s;e
<PB N="532" REF="027132_0540_0FD3533F175AF548">
the humble innocent, or to let the haughty guilty go free. It neverthele&s;s admits of impeachments; not upon the ground which has been mentioned, but upon a much more &s;ub&s;tantial one: The innocence or guilt of a public officer may and often does depend on a va|riety of nice intricacies of law, which but few jurymen are competent to determine, and therefore our Con&s;ti|tution wi&s;ely declares that "The Governor and all other civil officers under this commonwealth &s;hall be liable to impeachment for any mi&s;demeanor in office." It is therefore evident that the humble&s;t man in office is liable to impeachment for any mi&s;demeanor in office, and that no man however wealthy he may be, is liable to impeachment for any other cau&s;e; and hence it re|&s;ults, that all the in&s;truction which we have received on this head was ill-timed, and could only have been intended to mi&s;lead or to make a vain parade of learn|ing.</P>
<P>There is one thing, Mr. Speaker, which my client has ju&s;t cau&s;e to complain of. The Hou&s;e of Repre|&s;entatives, (&s;ee page 108) after exhibiting their char|ges, pledged them&s;elves to offer proof of the premi&s;es; but upon what grounds did they thus pledge them|&s;elves? Why as to the very <HI>e&s;&s;ence</HI> of the third article it was on the hear-&s;ay of the committee of impeach|ments; founded on the hear&s;ay of the committee of ways and means; founded on the hear&s;ay of a man <HI>not under oath;</HI> and they afterwards materially altered that charge, on a <HI>chit-chat</HI> conver&s;ation between the &s;ame man, and a member of the Hou&s;e, as it was reported to the Hou&s;e by that member, and without requiring any oath from that member or his informant, or taking any trouble to enquire into the truth of it.</P>
<P>By this extraordinary procedure has the defendant been deprived of that &s;ecurity to which every man is by the laws and con&s;titution of his country entitled; and this too by the very men who have thought proper to impeach the defendant for a &s;uppo&s;ed violation of the law and con&s;titution! If he is guilty, they have cer|tainly
<PB N="533" REF="027132_0541_0FD3536F37634688">
been &s;o complai&s;ant as to keep him in counte|nance, and he may ju&s;tly retort upon them <HI>Turpe e&s;t doctori cum culpa redarguit ip&s;um.</HI></P>
<P>When it is con&s;idered that they are the &s;worn guardians of the laws and con&s;titution of the country, they mu&s;t appear but with an ill grace as the accu&s;ers of others, at the moment of committing &s;o flagrant a violation on their part. I allude to the third article which charges that the defendant did "not con&s;ult the Regi&s;ter-Ge|neral nor the Governor," and yet tho&s;e who made this charge, knew no more about the truth or fal&s;ity of it, legally &s;peaking, than any man in <HI>Europe.</HI> It appears indeed that Mr. <HI>Gallatin told</HI> the Hou&s;e, that Mr. <HI>Don|nald&s;on</HI> had <HI>told</HI> him &s;o, but it al&s;o appears, that the Hou&s;e upon this information, un&s;upported by any oath or enquiry before them&s;elves or a committee, voted the charge <HI>true;</HI> and what aggravates their conduct (if it be capable of aggravation) is, that Mr. <HI>Gallatin,</HI> a leading member in bringing forward the impeachment, now &s;wears that <HI>as Mr.</HI> Donnald&s;on <HI>was an officer of government they thought he might be heard without an oath!</HI> A <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> peer, when &s;itting on an impeachment, an&s;wers upon his <HI>honour;</HI> when te&s;tifying as a witne&s;s he an&s;wers upon his <HI>oath,</HI> but the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;ent|atives have attached to the officers of government, a privilege &s;anctioned by no experience, and reprobated by the laws and con&s;titution of this country!</P>
<P>So much for the manner in which the impeachment has been brought forward. Whether it is &s;upported or not, remains to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>It may not be improper however to ob&s;erve, that in writing or &s;peaking, our arrangements &s;hould be &s;uch, as that, <HI>that</HI> which precedes, &s;hould prepare the way for that which is to follow; and that the latter may be the re&s;ult of the former; el&s;e repetition, ob&s;curity and wa&s;te of time will be the con&s;equence. Under this idea I cannot think of con&s;idering the articles in the order of their arrangement, nor has the Coun&s;el on either &s;ide found it practicable. My po&s;itions will be&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="534" REF="027132_0542_0FD353713B338868">Fir&s;t. THAT THE NEW-LOAN CERTIFICATES WERE SUBSCRIBABLE TO THE LOAN OF THE UNITED STATES; AND OF COURSE, WERE REDEEMABLE AT THE TREASURY OF PENNSYLVANIA.</P>
<P>Second. THAT THERE WAS AN APPROPRIATION MADE BY LAW FOR THAT PURPOSE.</P>
<P>Third. THAT NO CRIMINAL OFFENCE IS SUFFICIENT|LY CHARGED AND PROVED AGAINST THE COMPTROL|LER-GENERAL.</P>
<P>Subdivi&s;ions will perhaps be nece&s;&s;ary for the more clear elucidation of the&s;e points.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t po&s;ition. THAT THE NEW-LOAN CERTIFICATES WERE SUBSCRIBABLE TO THE LOAN OF THE UNITED STATES; AND OF COURSE, WERE REDEEMABLE AT THE TREASURY OF PENNSYLVANIA.</P>
<P>Under this po&s;ition, we are &s;o far from agreeing with our opponents the learned managers, that the Act of March 27, 1789 aboli&s;hed the New-Loan debt, created by the Act of March 1&s;t 1786, as to boldly contend, that it left it as it was before, with this difference only, that it was funded by the law of 1786 and unfunded by the law of 1789, and left without the means of pay|ment until &s;ome new provi&s;ion &s;hould be made for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>We &s;ay that &s;o much of the Act of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> of March 1&s;t, 1786, as a&s;&s;umed the debt due to her own ci|tizens from the U. S. was a noble exertion of patrioti&s;m, benevolently intended and wi&s;ely calculated to add value to their certificates, and in&s;pire them with confidence, when they had but little in the funds of the United States; but that &s;o much of it as provided the means of payment, was originally founded on a breach of faith; was beyond the power of the Legi&s;lature of <HI>Penn&s;ylva|nia,</HI> and if not originally uncon&s;titutional and void, it became &s;o by the adoption of the Federal Con&s;titution. It was therefore the meaning and duty of the A&s;&s;embly in March 1789 to repeal one part of the Act of 1786, but it had neither the power nor the will to repeal the other part of it.</P>
<P><PB N="535" REF="027132_0543_0FD353750BD173A0">To determine this, a minute attention to &s;ome pre|vious matters is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and the que&s;tion will be found to be &s;o important, that it &s;hould not be lo&s;t &s;ight of in any &s;tage of our enquiries.</P>
<P>All debts due to foreign and dome&s;tic creditors of every de&s;cription, for monies loaned, &s;upplies furni&s;h|ed and &s;ervices performed for the general defence, were contracted on the faith of the whole Union, and each of tho&s;e creditors, whether con&s;i&s;ting of a nation or of a private individual, had both an equitable and legal claim on the aggregate fund, compo&s;ed of the quotas of the &s;everal &s;tates for payment. Foreign nations as well as foreign and dome&s;tic citizens, tru&s;ted on the &s;ecurity of this aggregate fund and on the plighted faith of the Union for payment out of it, and no one &s;tate had the power of extricating her&s;elf or her quota of the public debt, from the claim of all the public creditors, by appropriating her quota in favour of any particular cla&s;s of citizens in exclu&s;ion of others&mdash;yet it will be found that <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> by her Act of 1786 undertook to make a partial appropriation of her quota in favour of her own citizens, and to the prejudice of all other public creditors of every de&s;cription. If this &s;hall be found to be the ca&s;e, and if it &s;hall al&s;o ap|pear, that <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> had no &s;uch power, it will re|&s;ult as a nece&s;&s;ary conclu&s;ion, that &s;o much of the Act of 1786 as provided the means of payment of the New-Loan certificates, was founded on a breach of public faith and was under the articles of Confederation un|con&s;titutional&mdash;It was therefore the duty of the Legi&s;|lature in the year 1789 to repeal this part of the Act of 1786&mdash;But in 1786 <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> had the power of a&s;&s;uming upon her&s;elf the payment of that part of the public debt which was due to her own citizens, either upon any other funds than her quota of the public debt due from the Union, or without funding it at all&mdash;By her Act of 1786 &s;he did a&s;&s;ume it, and therefore &s;o much of that Act as related to the a&s;&s;umption could not without a breach of faith be repealed by her in

1789&mdash;The&s;e remarks will afford a &s;ufficient clue for the true interpretation of the law of 1789 and which I &s;hall come to con&s;ider its letter and &s;pirit, I tru&s;t it will appear that the Legi&s;lature of 1789 intended to re&s;tore public faith by repealing &s;o much of the Act of 1786 as was founded on a breach of it, but that it did not intend committing a new breach of the public faith, by repealing that part of the Act of 1786 which was &s;o far from being uncon&s;titutional as to be highly com|mendable&mdash;As a foundation for what has been &s;aid and for that which is to follow, it is now proper to turn to the articles of Confederation which contain the follow|ing provi&s;ions&mdash;</P>

in any particular, but &s;he went further; the intere&s;t which under a former regulation of Congre&s;s had been payable to certain de&s;criptions of public creditors by bills drawn upon <HI>France,</HI> was by a re&s;olution of Con|gre&s;s of the 9th of September 1782 &s;topped, with a retro&s;pect to the fir&s;t of March then next preceding&mdash; Con&s;iderable arrearages of intere&s;t were due and un|provided for&mdash;The pre&s;&s;ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alls of Congre&s;s upon the &s;everal &s;tates, to be enabled to di&s;charge tho&s;e arrear|ages, had not been li&s;tened to or had been di&s;regarded by &s;ome of them&mdash;The di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the public credi|tors were doubtle&s;s great, and it is well known that their complaints had became no le&s;s &s;o. <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> was not I believe among the delinquent &s;tates, and as if feeling for her own citizens only when her feelings &s;hould have been alike for the public creditors in ge|neral, &s;he by the Act to which I have ju&s;t referred made a further grant of one hundred and twenty thou&s;and dollars is favour of the former, and at the &s;ame time declared that this &s;um <HI>&s;hould be charged to the United States, and deducted from her quota of the debt of the Union,</HI> when the &s;ame &s;hould be fixed and a&s;certained.</P>

of the war, together with the critical exigen|cies of public affairs, have made it the duty of Con|gre&s;s to review and provide for the debts which the war has left upon the United States, and to look for|ward to the means of obviating dangers which may in|terrupt the harmony and tranquillity of the confede|racy. The re&s;ult of their mature and &s;olemn delibe|rations on the&s;e great objects, is contained in their &s;e|veral recommendations of the 18th in&s;t. herewith tran&s;|mitted. Although the&s;e recommendations &s;peak them|&s;elves the principles on which they are founded, as well as the ends which they propo&s;e, it will not be improper to enter into a few explanations and remarks, in order to place in a &s;tronger view the nece&s;&s;ity of complying with them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t mea&s;ure recommended is, effectual pro|vi&s;ion for the debt of the U. S. The amount of the&s;e debts, as far as they can now be a&s;certained, is 42,000,375 dollars, as will appear by the &s;chedule No. 1. To di&s;|charge the principal of this aggregate debt at once, or in any &s;hort period, is evidently not within the com|pa&s;s of our re&s;ources; and even if it could be accom|pli&s;hed, the ca&s;e of the community would require that the debt it&s;elf &s;hould be le&s;s to a cour&s;e of gradual extingui&s;hment, and certain funds be provided for pay|ing in the mean time the annual intere&s;t. The amount of the annual intere&s;t, as will appear by the paper la&s;t referred to, is computed to be 2,415,956 dollars. Funds, therefore, which will certainly and punctually produce this annual &s;um at lea&s;t, mu&s;t be provided.</P>
<P>"In devi&s;ing the&s;e funds Congre&s;s did not overlook the mode of &s;upplying the common Trea&s;ury, provided by the articles of Confederation; but after the mo&s;t re&s;pectful con&s;ideration of that mode, they were con|&s;trained to regard it as inadequate and inapplicable to the form into which the public debt mu&s;t be thrown. The delays and uncertainties incident to a revenue to be e&s;tabli&s;hed and collected form time to time by thir|teen independent authorities, is at fir&s;t view irrecon|cileable
<PB N="544" REF="027132_0552_0FD3537DA3584B48">
with the punctuality e&s;&s;ential in the di&s;charge of the intere&s;t of a national debt&punc; Our own experience after making every allowance for tran&s;ient impedi|ments, has been a &s;ufficient illu&s;tration of this truth. Some departure, therefore, in the recommendations of Congre&s;s, from the Federal Con&s;titution, was unavoid|able; but it will be found to be as &s;mall as could be reconciled with the object in view, and to be &s;upported be&s;ides by &s;olid con&s;iderations of intere&s;t and &s;ound po|licy.</P>
<P>"The fund which fir&s;t pre&s;ented it&s;elf on this, as it did on a former occa&s;ion, was a tax on imports. The rea|&s;ons which recommended this branch of revenue, have heretofore been &s;tated in an Act, of which a copy, No. 2, is now forwarded, and need not be here repeated. It will &s;uffice to recapitulate, that taxes on con&s;umption are always lea&s;t burden&s;ome, becau&s;e they are lea&s;t felt, and are borne too, by tho&s;e who are both willing and able to pay them; that, of all taxes on con&s;umption, tho&s;e on foreign commerce are mo&s;t compatible with the genius and policy of free &s;tates; that from the re|lative po&s;itions of &s;ome of the more commercial &s;tates, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to bring this e&s;&s;ential re&s;ource into u&s;e without a concerted uniformity; that this uniform|ity cannot be concerted through any channel &s;o pro|perly as through Congre&s;s, nor for any purpo&s;e &s;o aptly as for paying the debts of a revolution, from which an unbounded freedom has accrued to commerce.</P>
<P>"In renewing this propo&s;ition to the &s;tates, we have not been unmindful to the objections which heretofore fru&s;tated the unanimous adoption of it. We have limited the duration of the revenue to the term of 25 years; and we have left to the &s;tates them&s;elves the appoint|ment of the officers who are to collect it. If the &s;trict maxims of national credit alone were to be con&s;ulted, the revenue ought manife&s;tly to be con&s;i&s;tent with the object of it, and the collection placed in every re&s;pect under that authority which is to di&s;pen&s;e the former, and is re&s;pon&s;ible for the latter. The&s;e relaxations
<PB N="545" REF="027132_0553_0FD353085234A118">
will, we tru&s;t, be regarded on one hand as the effect of a di&s;po&s;ition in Congre&s;s to attend at all times to the &s;entiments of tho&s;e whom they &s;erve, and on the other hand, as a proof of their anxious de&s;ire that provi&s;ion may be made in &s;ome way or other for an honorable and ju&s;t fulfilment of the engagements which they have formed.</P>
<P>"To render this fund as productive as po&s;&s;ible, and at the &s;ame time to narrow the room for collu&s;ions and frauds, it has been judged an improvement of the plan, to recommend a liberal duty on &s;uch articles as are mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of a tax according to their quantity, and are of mo&s;t equal and general con&s;umption; leav|ing all other articles, as heretofore propo&s;ed, to be taxed according to their value.</P>
<P>"The amount of this fund is computed to be 915,956 dollars. The e&s;timates on which the computation is made, are detailed in paper No. 3. Accuracy in the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay on &s;o complex and fluctuating a &s;ubject is not to be expected. It is pre&s;umed to be as near the truth as the defect of proper materials would admit.</P>
<P>"The re&s;idue of the computed intere&s;t is 1,500,000 dollars, and is referred to the &s;tates to be provided for by &s;uch funds as they may judge mo&s;t convenient. Here again the &s;trict maxims of public credit gave way to the de&s;ire of Congre&s;s to conform to the &s;entiments of their con&s;tituents. It ought not to be omitted, how|ever, with re&s;pect to this portion of the revenue, that the mode in which it is to be &s;upplied, varies &s;o little from that pointed out in the articles of Confederation, and the variations are &s;o conducive to the great object propo&s;ed, that a ready and unqualified compliance on the part of the &s;tates may be the more ju&s;tly expected. In fixing the quotas of this &s;um, Congre&s;s, as may be well imagined, were guided by very imperfect lights, and &s;ome inequalities may con&s;equently have en&s;ued. The&s;e, however, can be but temporary, and as far as they may exi&s;t at all, will be redre&s;&s;ed by a retro&s;pect|ive
<PB N="546" REF="027132_0554_0FD3532396BFD270">
adju&s;tment, as &s;oon as a con&s;titutional rule can be applied.</P>
<P>"The nece&s;&s;ity of making the two foregoing provi|&s;ions one indivi&s;ible and irrevocable act, is apparent. Without the fir&s;t quality, partial provi&s;ion only might be made where complete provi&s;ion is e&s;&s;ential; nay, as &s;ome &s;tates might prefer and adopt one of the funds only, and the other &s;tates the other fund only, it might happen that no provi&s;ion at all would be made: with|out the &s;econd a &s;ingle &s;tate out of the thirteen might at any time involve the nation in bankruptcy, the mere practicability of which would be a fatal bar to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of national credit. In&s;tead of enlarging on the&s;e topics, two ob&s;ervations are &s;ubmitted to the ju&s;|tice and wi&s;dom of the Legi&s;latures. Fir&s;t: The pre|&s;ent creditors, or rather the dome&s;tic part of them, having either made their loans for a period which has expired, or having become creditors in the fir&s;t in&s;tance involuntarily, are entitled on the clear principles of ju&s;tice and good faith, to demand the principle of their credits, in&s;tead of accepting the annual intere&s;t. It is nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, as the principal cannot be paid to them on demand, that the intere&s;t &s;hould be &s;o effec|tually and &s;atisfactorily &s;ecured, as to enable them if they incline, to transfer their &s;tock at its full value. Secondly; if the funds be &s;o firmly con&s;tituted as to in&s;pire a thorough and univer&s;al confidence, may it not be hoped, that the capital of the dome&s;tic debt, which bears the high intere&s;t of &s;ix per cent. may be concel|led by other loans obtained at a more moderate inter|e&s;t? The &s;aving by &s;uch an operation, would be a clear one, and might be a con&s;iderable one. As a proof of the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ub&s;tantial funds for the &s;upport of our credit abroad, we refer to paper No. 4.</P>
<P>"Thus much for the intere&s;t of the national debt: for the di&s;charge of the principal within the term li|mited, we rely on the natural increa&s;e of the revenue from commerce, on requi&s;itions to be made from time to time for that purpo&s;e, as circum&s;tances may dictate,
<PB N="547" REF="027132_0555_0FD3537EC5709400">
and on the pro&s;pect of vacant territory. If the&s;e re|&s;ources &s;hould prove inadequate, it will be nece&s;&s;ary, at the expiration of twenty-five years, to continue the funds now recommended, or to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch others as may then be found more canvenient.</P>
<P>"With a view to the re&s;ource la&s;t mentioned, as well as to obviate di&s;agreeable controver&s;ies and confu&s;ions, Congre&s;s have included in their pre&s;ent recommenda|tions, a renewal of tho&s;e of the 6th day of September, and of the 10th day of October, 1780. In both tho&s;e re&s;pects, a liberal and final accommodation of all in|terfering claims of vacant territory, is an object which cannot be pre&s;&s;ed with too much &s;olicitude.</P>
<P>"The la&s;t object recommended is, a con&s;titutional change of the rule by which a partition of the com|mon burdens is to be made. The expediency and even nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a change, has been &s;ufficiently enforc|ed by the local inju&s;tice and di&s;contents which have proceeded from valuations of the &s;oil in every &s;tate where the experiment has been made. But how infi|nitely mu&s;t the&s;e evils be increa&s;ed, on a compari&s;on of &s;uch valuations among the &s;tates them&s;elves! On what|ever &s;ide indeed this rule be &s;urveyed, the execution of it mu&s;t be attended with the mo&s;t &s;erious difficulties. If the valuations be referred to the authorities of the &s;everal &s;tates, a general &s;atisfaction is not to be hoped for: If they be executed by officers of the United States traver&s;ing the country for that purpo&s;e, be&s;ides the inequalities again&s;t which this mode would be no &s;ecurity, the expence would be both enormous and ob|noxious: If the mode taken in the Act of the 17th day of February la&s;t, which was deemed on the whole lea&s;t objectionable, be adhered to, &s;till the in&s;ufficiency of the data to the purpo&s;e to which they are to be applied, mu&s;t greatly impair, if not utterly de&s;troy all confidence in the accuracy of the re&s;ult; not to mention that as far as the re&s;ult can be at all a ju&s;t one, it will be in|debted for the advantage to the principle on which the rule propo&s;ed to be &s;ub&s;tituted is &s;ounded. This rule,

although not free from objections, is liable to fewer than any other that could be devi&s;ed. The only ma|terial difficulty which attended it in the deliberations of Congre&s;s, was to fix the proper difference between the labour and indu&s;try of free inhabitants, and of all other inhabitants. The ratio ultimately agreed on was the effect of mutual conce&s;&s;ions; and if it &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed not to corre&s;pond preci&s;ely with the fact, no doubt ought to be entertained that an equal &s;pirit of accommodation among the &s;everal Legi&s;latures, will prevail again&s;t little inequalities which may be calcu|lated on one &s;ide or on the other. But notwith&s;tand|ing the confidence of Congre&s;s, as to the &s;ucce&s;s of this propo&s;ition, it is their duty to recollect that the event may po&s;&s;ibly di&s;appoint them, and to reque&s;t that mea&s;ures may &s;till be pur&s;ued for obtaining and tran&s;mitting the information called for in the Act of the 17th of Febru|ary la&s;t, which in &s;uch event will be e&s;&s;ential.</P>
<P>"The plan thus communicated and explained by Congre&s;s mu&s;t now receive its fate from their con&s;titu|ents. All the objects compri&s;ed in it are conceived to be of great importance to the happine&s;s of this confe|derated republic, are nece&s;&s;ary to render the fruits of the revolution a full reward for the blood, the toils, the cares and the calamities which have purcha&s;ed it. But the object of which the nece&s;&s;ity will be peculiarly felt, and which it is peculiarly the duty of Congre&s;s in inculcate, is the provi&s;ion recommended for the nati|onal debt. Although this debt is greater than could have been wi&s;hed, it is &s;till le&s;s on the whole than could have been expected, and when referred to the cau&s;e in which it has been incurred, and compared with the burdens which wars of ambition and of vain glory have entailed on other nations, ought to be borne not only with chearfulne&s;s but with pride. But the magnitude of the debt makes no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">t of the que&s;tion. It is &s;uffi|cient that the debt has been fairly contracted and that ju&s;tice and good faith demand that it &s;hould be fully di&s;charged. Congre&s;s had no option but between dif|ferent
<PB N="549" REF="027132_0557_0FD352C57840B9F0">
modes of di&s;charging it. The &s;ame option is the only one that can exi&s;t with the &s;tates. The mode which has after a long and elaborate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, been preferred, is, we are per&s;uaded, the lea&s;t objectionable of any that would have been equal to the purpo&s;e. Under this per&s;ua&s;ion, we call upon the ju&s;tice and plighted faith of the &s;everal &s;tates to give it its proper effect, to reflect on the con&s;equences of rejecting it, and to remember that Congre&s;s will not be an&s;werable for them.</P>
<P>"If other motives than that of ju&s;tice could be re|qui&s;ite on this occa&s;ion, no nation could ever feel &s;tronger; for to whom are the debts to be paid?</P>
<P>To AN ALLY, in the fir&s;t place, who to the exertion of his arms in &s;upport of our cau&s;e, has added the &s;uc|cours of his trea&s;ure; who, to his important loans, has added liberal donations; and who&s;e loans them|&s;elves carry the impre&s;&s;ion of his magnanimity and friend&s;hip. For more exact information on this point we refer to paper No. 5.</P>
<P>"To <HI>individuals in a foreign country,</HI> in the next place, who were the fir&s;t to give &s;o precious a token of their confidence in our ju&s;tice, and of their friend&s;hip for our cau&s;e, and who are members of a republic which was &s;econd in e&s;pou&s;ing our rank among nations. For the claims and expectations of this cla&s;s of creditors we refer to paper No. 6.</P>
<P>"Another cla&s;s of creditors is, <HI>that illu&s;trious</HI> and <HI>patriotic band of fellow-citizens,</HI> who&s;e blood and who&s;e bravery, have defended the liberties of their country, who have patiently borne, among other di&s;tre&s;&s;es, the privation of their &s;tipends, whil&s;t the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their country di&s;abled it from be&s;towing them; and who, even now, a&s;k for no more than &s;uch a portion of their dues as will enable them to retire from the field of victory and glory into the bo&s;om of peace and pri|vate citizen&s;hip, and for &s;uch effectual &s;ecurity for the re&s;idue of their claims, as their country is now un|que&s;tionably able to provide.

<P>"The remaining cla&s;s of creditors is compo&s;ed partly of &s;uch of our fellow-citizens as originally lent to the public the u&s;e of their funds, or have &s;ince ma|nife&s;ted mo&s;t confidence in their country, by receiving transfers from the lenders; and partly of tho&s;e who&s;e property has been either advanced or a&s;&s;umed for the public &s;ervice. To <HI>di&s;criminate</HI> the merits of the&s;e &s;eve|ral de&s;criptions of creditors, would be a ta&s;k equally un|nece&s;&s;ary and invidious. If the voice of humanity plead more loudly in favour of &s;ome than of others, the voice of policy, no le&s;s than of ju&s;tice, pleads in favour of all. A wi&s;e nation will never permit tho&s;e who relieve the wants of their country, or who rely mo&s;t on its faith, its firmne&s;s and its re&s;ources, when either of them is di&s;tru&s;ted, to &s;uffer by the event.</P>
<P>"Let it be remembered, finally, that it has ever been the pride and boa&s;t of <HI>America,</HI> that the righ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for which &s;he contended, were the rights of human nature.

<P>Although it is admitted, Mr. Speaker, that this Act was not to operate as a law until &s;imilar ones, at lea&s;t in principle, &s;hould be enacted by all the other &s;tates; yet nothing can, I apprehend, be more clear than that as the object of it was to provide for the quota of <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania</HI> for the term of twenty-five years, and as it contained a conditional grant, of it for that period, <HI>that</HI> grant could not, even independent of the articles of Confederation, be withdrawn within that time, &s;ince it contained no &s;uch provi&s;ion, and the whole of that time was allowed for other &s;tates to pa&s;s &s;imilar laws&mdash; On this head I &s;hall have occa&s;ion by and by to remark more fully, and therefore I will forbear doing it at pre|&s;ent.</P>
<P>The next material &s;tep taken by the Legi&s;lature <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and connected with the object of our pre&s;ent enquiries, was, the pa&s;&s;ing of a law on the 16th of March 1785. This law formed the revenues of the &s;tate into an aggregate fund for &s;everal pur|po&s;es, and among others for that of paying the &s;tate's e&s;timated quota of the annual intere&s;t of the debt of the United States contracted during the late war, and &s;uppo&s;ed to amount to &pound;. 123,932. But &s;uch payment was not to be made into the Trea&s;ury of the U. S. for the benefit of all the creditors of the United States,
<PB N="553" REF="027132_0561_0FD352DCE9773FE8">
but it was &s;pecially provided, that the &s;aid e&s;timated quota &s;hould be for the &s;ole and exclu&s;ive benefit of &s;uch creditors of the United States as were citizens of this &s;tate&mdash;The&s;e payments were directed to be made through the medium of the Continental Loan-officer; he was ordered to keep fair and proper accounts thereof, in order that this &s;tate might have proper credit there|for in account with the United States; and the Act was to continue in force until the United States &s;hould make and carry into execution other effectual and per|manent provi&s;ion for paying the annual intere&s;t and ar|rearages of intere&s;t due on the debt of the United States to the public creditors thereof.</P>
<P>No comment can be at pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ary upon this Act; it &s;peaks for it&s;elf, and its language is that of perfidy&mdash;It was &s;o con&s;idered by Congre&s;s, and on the 27th of September following they took mea&s;ures which completely defeated its operation&mdash;on that day it was "re&s;olved that the commi&s;&s;ioner of the Continental Loan-office in any &s;tate, &s;hould not on any pretence what|ever &s;ettle or i&s;&s;ue any certificate for the intere&s;t due on any Continental Loan-office certificate, or other certifi|cate of liquidated debts, unle&s;s as hereafter provided, until the &s;tate for which he is Continental Loan-officer, &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed a legi&s;lative Act complying with this requi&s;ition, (to wit, a requi&s;ition from the &s;everal &s;tates of their re&s;pective quotas) nor &s;hall he i&s;&s;ue any certificate or take any other mea&s;ure whereby the inter|e&s;t may be paid by the &s;tate in any mode not pointed out by this requi&s;ition; nor &s;hall the Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Continental Loan-office in any &s;tate, that &s;hall have complied with this requi&s;ition, i&s;&s;ue any certificate or take any other mea&s;ure, whereby a di&s;crimination may be made by &s;uch &s;tate between the holders of Loan-of|fice certificates i&s;&s;ued from his office, who are ci|tizens of that &s;tate, and foreigners or the citizens of any other &s;tate that &s;hall have complied with this re|qui&s;ition"&mdash;And Congre&s;s on the &s;ame day, further re|&s;olved that if any &s;uch commi&s;&s;ioner &s;hould di&s;obey or

neglect to carry into execution any re&s;olution or order of Congre&s;s, the board of trea&s;ury &s;hould &s;u&s;pend him from his office and appoint another in his room.</P>
<P>The clamours of the public creditors at home and abroad, who had been excluded from their ju&s;t rights by di&s;criminating Acts of legi&s;lation, in favour of a particular cla&s;s of creditors, loudly demanded from Congre&s;s this firm tone of conduct, and by adopting it, they &s;hewed their abhorrence of principles to which I will not give a name.</P>
<P>What I have hitherto dwelt upon, Mr. Speaker, may be con&s;idered but as the follies of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> when compared with that which is to follow. When &s;he found her&s;elf baffled, and her &s;y&s;tem of di&s;crimination de|feated by Congre&s;s, &s;he in the fatal moment of &s;ome unpropitious influence, adopted the bold and de&s;perate mea&s;ure of enacting the law to which I &s;hall now turn &mdash;It could not be era&s;ed from her records in the year 1789, and there was no way of removing the di&s;grace which it had brought with it, but by repealing its ob|noxious and baneful parts&mdash;It was pa&s;&s;ed on the 1&s;t of March 1786&mdash;and by it <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> a&s;&s;umed upon her&s;elf payment of the whole of the debt due to her own citi|zens from the United States for monies loaned, &s;upplies furni&s;hed or &s;ervices performed during the late war; &s;he provided for the payment of the intere&s;t thereof half yearly, until the fir&s;t day of March 1796, and then for the payment of the principal; &s;he mortgaged for &s;e|curing the payment of the intere&s;t the aggregate fund provided by the Act of the 16th of March 1785; and that aggregate fund was made up in part of the very fund which &s;he had before ve&s;ted in the United States for the payment of her quota to all the creditors of the Union.</P>
<P>This Act was unconditional and it was without li|mitation as to time&mdash;It therefore merits a very different con&s;ideration from any of the former Acts, nor do I conceive any tolerable apology which can be fairly
<PB N="555" REF="027132_0563_0FD352C90B8A44F8">
made for the framers of it&mdash;That part of it indeed which contained the a&s;&s;umption, I am not di&s;po&s;ed to find fault with, and if I was, perhaps my objections would appear groundle&s;s; but that part of it which mortgaged the quota of this &s;tate for payment to he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> own citizens only, is perhaps unexampled by legi&s;lat|ive acts even in the wor&s;t of times.</P>
<P>In the year 1788 the Con&s;titution of the United States was adopted and ratified&mdash;It provides that "The Con|gre&s;s &s;hall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, impo&s;ts and exci&s;es; to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the U. S.</P>
<P>"That no &s;tate &s;hall without the con&s;ent of Con|gre&s;s lay any impo&s;ts or duties on imports or exports, except what may be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for executing its in&s;pection laws, and the net produce of all duties and impo&s;ts laid by any &s;tate on imports or exports, &s;hall be for the u&s;e of the Trea&s;ury of the United States."</P>

<P>"This Con&s;titution and the laws of the United States which &s;hall be made in pur&s;uance thereof, &s;hall be the &s;upreme law of the land."</P>
<P>On the 27th of March 1789 the Legi&s;lature of <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania</HI> pa&s;&s;ed a law, which after &s;ome recitals, unne|ce&s;&s;ary to be read at pre&s;ent, though they may be pro|per to be ob&s;erved upon by and by, enacted that "the intere&s;t due and to become due and payable upon all and every the certificates i&s;&s;ued by the Comptroller-General in pur&s;uance of the &s;aid recited Acts or either of them, &s;hall be paid up, &s;o as to complete the pay|ment of intere&s;t to four years; and that &s;o much of every Act or Acts of General A&s;&s;embly, as directs or

<P>The fir&s;t po&s;ition, Mr. Speaker, which I have pro|po&s;ed maintaining is, <HI>That the New-Loan certificates were &s;ub&s;cribable to the loan of the United States; and of cour&s;e, were redeemable at the Trea&s;ury of</HI> Penn&s;ylvania;" and I have in an early &s;tage of my remarks ventured to &s;tate as the ground of this po&s;ition, that "the Act of the 27th of March 1789 was &s;o far from aboli&s;hing the New-Loan debt created by the Act of the 1&s;t of March 1786, as to leave it as it was before, with this differ|ence only, that it was funded by the law of 1786, and unfunded by that of 1789, and left without the means of payment, until &s;ome new provi&s;ion &s;hould be made for that purpo&s;e; and I at the &s;ame time added, that it was the meaning and duty of the A&s;&s;embly in March 1789 to repeal &s;o much of the Act of 1786 as provided the means of payment; as was originally founded on a breach of faith, and as was beyond the power of the Legi&s;lature to enact; but I denied that the Legi&s;lature of 1789 had either the power or the will to repeal that part of the Act which a&s;&s;umed the debt.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the materials nece&s;&s;ary to a deci&s;ion of the&s;e que&s;tions are now before the honorable Senate. As I proceed in my argument I &s;hall occa&s;ionally have re|cour&s;e to the re&s;t of them.</P>
<P>The ground which I have hitherto taken is intended to &s;hew, that the New-Loan debt as it is called, cre|ated by the Act of 1786, continued to exi&s;t notwith|&s;tanding the law of 1789&mdash;If it did not continue to exi&s;t, I mu&s;t admit that the New-Loan certificates were not &s;ub&s;cribable to the loan of the United States; and if it did continue to exi&s;t, it follows as a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;e|quence that they were &s;ub&s;cribable&mdash;The e&s;tabli&s;hing of the point is therefore of &s;o much importance to the defendant as to afford a &s;ufficient apology for my en|deavouring
<PB N="557" REF="027132_0565_0FD3530A4A1227D0">
to draw the attention of the honorable Se|nate to a &s;hort review of the ground over which I have pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>It has been &s;hewn, that all debts due to foreign and dome&s;tic creditors of every de&s;cription, for monies loaned, &s;upplies furni&s;hed and &s;ervices performed for the general defence during the late war, were contracted on the faith of the whole Union, and of cour&s;e that each of the&s;e creditors whether foreign or dome&s;tic, and whether con&s;i&s;ting of a nation or of a private in|dividual, has both an equitable and a legal claim on all the &s;tates for payment&mdash;It may have &s;ometimes hap|pened, that nations in all the pride of power and ima|ginary omnipotence, have been &s;o regardle&s;s of cha|racter and of the &s;acred voice of ju&s;tice, as to &s;ub&s;titute <HI>that</HI> power as the only mea&s;ure of right, and by adopt|ing a conduct which in the humble walks of private life, would con&s;ign an individual to de&s;erved di&s;grace and infamy, have undertaken to cancel their engage|ments. Admitting for a moment, that <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> was willing to appear as a pro&s;titute among nations, yet &s;he had no authority to legi&s;late for foreign nations or foreign citizens, and of cour&s;e &s;he could not annul her obligations with them&mdash;Again, <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> was but an Integral part of the United States, and &s;he could have no preten&s;ions to the right of annulling their con|tracts or extricating her&s;elf from their binding obliga|tions on her.</P>
<P>It has been &s;hewn, that the articles of Confederation were propo&s;ed to, and ratified by all the &s;tates; that every &s;tate thereby bound her&s;elf to abide by the de|terminations of the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;em|bled, on all que&s;tions thereby &s;ubmitted to them; that each &s;tate by a &s;olemn compact declared that they &s;hould be inviolably ob&s;erved by every &s;tate, and that no al|teration &s;hould at any time be made in any of them, unle&s;s it &s;hould be agreed to in a Congre&s;s of the U|nited States, and be afterwards confirmed by the Le|gi&s;latures of every &s;tate; that all the charges of war
<PB N="558" REF="027132_0566_0FD35383483FB990">
and other expences incurred for the common defence or general welfare, &s;hould be defrayed out of a com|mon Trea&s;ury &s;upplied by the &s;everal &s;tates in &s;uch proportion as &s;hould be fixed by Congre&s;s, and that for the payment and &s;atisfaction thereof the United States and the public faith were thereby pledged; that the quota of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> was fixed in the manner pre|&s;cribed by the articles of Confederation, and that there|fore, unle&s;s a part is greater than the whole; unle&s;s the power of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> &s;ingly, is greater than that of all the &s;tates collectively; unle&s;s &s;he had a right to legi&s;late for foreign citizens and foreign nations, and unle&s;s &s;he could at plea&s;ure withdraw her faith and cancel her en|gagements, her quota could not be applied by her in favour of one cla&s;&s; of creditors, and to the exclu&s;ion of others.</P>
<P>It has been &s;hewn that <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> by her law of 1783 granted her quota, which had been fixed and cal|led for by Congre&s;s for the payment of the intere&s;t due to the public creditors until provi&s;ion &s;hould be made for the di&s;charge of the principal, and that by this ad|ditional ratification of her former obligations &s;he be|came doubly bound to a faithful compliance with them.</P>
<P>It has been &s;hewn that <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> by another Act of the 23d of September 1783 authori&s;ed Congre&s;s, when the other &s;tates &s;hould come into the &s;ame mea&s;ure, for the term of 25 years to levy certain duties; and that &s;he her&s;elf provided for rai&s;ing certain taxes; at the &s;ame time, and in the mo&s;t explicit manner &s;he appropri|ated them to the di&s;charge of the intere&s;t and principal of the debts contracted on the faith of the United States for &s;upporting the war.</P>
<P>After all the&s;e engagements, &s;urely no rational man will &s;eriou&s;ly contend, that the quota of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> was not irrevocably mortgaged to all the public cre|ditors, or that <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> had the power of le&s;&s;ening the claims of any of them upon her for retribution&mdash; The Con&s;titution of the United States is the &s;upreme law of the land; it declares that "all debts contracted

<P>In what &s;ituation then did <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> find her&s;elf in the year 1789? She found among her records an Act &s;tamped with the name of a law, but part of it disfi|gured by features which &s;hewed that it rather merited the name of an arbitrary and de&s;potic edict&mdash;<HI>That</HI> part &s;he con&s;idered as a monument of her di&s;grace, and &s;he determined to repeal it, and by doing &s;o to re&s;tore her credit and the rights of all the creditors of the Union; but &s;he &s;aw another part of it, which infringed the rights of no one; interfered with no former engage|ments, that &s;he had an unque&s;tionable right to enact it; that &s;he had enacted it&punc; that &s;he had thereby pledged her faith where &s;he had a right to pledge it, and that it could not be repealed without a breach of that faith; that part therefore &s;he determined not to touch, and with the delicate hand of a &s;kilful &s;urgeon, &s;he probed the wound; &s;he &s;eparated the rotten from the &s;ound, and &s;he repealed &s;o much of the Act of 1786 as funded the New-Loan debt on her quota, in favour of her own citizens only, when it belonged not to them alone but to them in common with every other cla&s;s of creditors; b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t &s;o much of the &s;ame Act as a&s;&s;umed, without fund|ing the New-Loan debt &s;he could not without a mani|fe&s;t breach of faith repeal, and &s;he therefore left it as it was.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, Mr. Speaker, that &s;he had neither the power nor the will to repeal this part of the Act.</P>
<P><PB N="560" REF="027132_0568_0FD3534739A212F8">That &s;he had not the power, will, I think, evidently appear from a con&s;ideration of the con&s;titution of the United States&mdash;"NO STATE SHALL PASS ANY EX+POST FA<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">O LAW, OR LAW IMPAIRING THE OBLIGA|TION OF CONTRACTS."</P>
<P>By the law of 1786, <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> propo&s;ed to receive from &s;uch of the creditors of the United States as were her own citizens, their Continental certificates, and to give them her own certificates in lieu thereof; &s;he pro|po&s;ed this but &s;he did not command it; &s;he offered that it might be done, but &s;he did not enact that it &s;hould be done; &s;he therefore appeared in the character of a per&s;on willing to contract with &s;uch per&s;ons as might accept of her terms&mdash;many per&s;ons did accept of them; &s;he received their Continental certificates; &s;he i&s;&s;ued new ones in lieu thereof, and through the agency of her Comptroller-General made as full and complete a contract, as can be expre&s;&s;ed in any form of words.</P>
<P>We have been told indeed that it was <HI>"a loan and not a contract;"</HI> that it was <HI>"a propo&s;al and not a bar|gain;"</HI> that it was <HI>"a receipt for the old certificate to be returned at her plea&s;ure, and not an obligation to pay the new one."</HI> But we have not been told, <HI>how there can be a loan without a contract!</HI> nor how a propo&s;al <HI>when agreed to and accepted,</HI> can be any thing &s;hort of a bar|gain! nor by what rule of con&s;truction it is, that a cer|tificate, &s;igned by the proper officer, and expre&s;&s;ed in the following words, to wit, "The commonwealth of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> hath received on loan from  <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">  the  <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">  of  <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">  to be paid to the &s;aid  <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">  or bearer, on or be|fore the fir&s;t day of March, 1796, with intere&s;t from the day of  <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">  at the rate of of 6 per cent. per annum, to be paid half yearly at the State Trea&s;ury, according to the direction of an Act of General A&s;&s;embly pa&s;&s;ed on the day of  <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word"> ," is to be con&s;idered only as a <HI>receipt</HI> for the old certificate, to be <HI>returned</HI> at the plea&s;ure of the commonwealth, and not an <HI>obligation</HI> to pay the new one; more e&s;pecially when it is con&s;idered, that by the Act for i&s;&s;uing the certificates, the intere&s;t is pay|able

half yearly, and the certificates are receivable at the land-office to <HI>the whole amount of the principal!</HI></P>
<P>It has al&s;o been &s;aid, Mr. Speaker by the honorable managers and the learned coun&s;el, that "The clau&s;e in the Con&s;titution of the United States, prohibiting the pa&s;&s;ing of <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> laws, and laws annulling the obli|gation of contracts, does not relate to &s;tates, but to pri|vate per&s;ons only." But before I &s;hall attempt a <HI>&s;erious</HI> an&s;wer to this <HI>&s;erious</HI> objection, I mu&s;t wait to be in|formed by &s;ome of tho&s;e Gentlemen how <HI>"private per|&s;ons"</HI> can pa&s;s a law of any kind!</P>
<P>Again, it has been &s;aid that "The clau&s;e in que&s;ti|on does not extend to the conduct of a &s;tate towards her own citizens, but that it leaves her to act with re|&s;pect to them, as &s;he may think proper."&mdash;To this I an&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That the clau&s;e in que&s;tion, contains no &s;uch exception, and that I am far from being &s;atisfied of the gentlemen's right to add it to the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P N="2">2d. That, foreign citizens and foreign &s;tates are in|tere&s;ted, and that therefore, if the propo&s;ition were true, yet that the conclu&s;ion would be unwarrantable.</P>
<P N="3">3d. That the rea&s;on is much &s;tronger, for the clau&s;e applying to the conduct of a &s;tate towards her own ci|tizens, than towards any body el&s;e; &s;ince &s;he has no right to legi&s;late, but for her own citizens, and the clau&s;e could not therefore be nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the rights of other citizens or foreign nations.</P>
<P>We are al&s;o told that "The clau&s;e refered to, only relates to contracts, and not to laws," but before I can po&s;&s;ibly give any other an&s;wer to this objection, than by laughing at it, I mu&s;t be informed how it is po&s;&s;ible that the&s;e words, "NO STATE SHALL PASS ANY EX POST FACTO LAW, OR LAW IMPAIRING THE OBLIGA|TION OF CONTRACTS," do not relate to laws, but only to contracts.</P>
<P>Again, &s;uppo&s;ing the propro&s;ition to be true; I a&s;k if it has not been inconte&s;tably proved, that a &s;tate is as capable of making a contract as a private individual
<PB N="562" REF="027132_0570_0FD3532B395DA370">
can po&s;&s;ibly be? If <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> had not made con|tracts? If they were not as binding on her, as they could be on an individual? and if &s;o, need I to add, that &s;he could pa&s;s no <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> law, or law impair|ing the obligation of contracts, more e&s;pecially in <HI>her own ca&s;e; in her own favor, and to the prejudice of her own creditors!</HI></P>
<P>Hence I conclude, that the Legi&s;lature of 1789 had not the power, even had it been &s;o weak or &s;o wicked as to have the will, of repealing that part of the Act of 1786 which a&s;&s;umed &s;o much of the debt of the Unit|ed States as was due to the citizens of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI> Independent of the uncon&s;titutionality of &s;uch a mea|&s;ure, it would have been &s;o extremely unju&s;t, that the intention is not fairly imputable, without much &s;tronger proofs, than are furni&s;hed by the language of the law of that date.</P>
<P>We have, it is true, been told that "Con&s;idering the proceedings which took place under the law of 1786 as but merely an <HI>exchange</HI> of one certificate for another, a <HI>re-exchange</HI> might with great propriety be ordered by a &s;ub&s;equent law, &s;ince this would only be putting mat|ters as they were before, and leaving them in <HI>&s;tatu quo,</HI> &s;o that no harm could po&s;&s;ibly be done"&mdash;But &s;urely this kind of rea&s;oning is altogether inadmi&s;&s;ible, and with|out even the merit of plau&s;ibility&mdash;In the year 1786 the United States, with the be&s;t of wi&s;hes towards their creditors, were, owing to the delinquency of &s;ome of the &s;tates; without the means of rendering them ju&s;tice &mdash;This was &s;o well known as in a great mea&s;ure to de|&s;troy all confidence in them, and a &s;tate &s;ecurity was by mo&s;t people deemed preferable to a continental one. <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> therefore by a&s;&s;uming &s;o much of the debt as was due to her own citizens, added confidence to them, enhanced the value of their claims, and &s;tamped them with a curr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ncy which they had not before&mdash;This brought them i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> circulation, and they were in hun|dreds, perhaps <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hou&s;ands of in&s;tances, purcha&s;ed for valuable con&s;ide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tions upon the faith of the State, and

Not &s;o would have been the ca&s;e, had &s;he undertaken to de&s;troy the debt&mdash;The debt due from the United States was either not funded at all, or it was funded on the quotas of the &s;everal &s;tates.&mdash; In the former &s;ituation, were the New-Loan creditors placed by the law of 1789, with the liberty, if they thought proper of being placed in the latter, by ex|changing their new certificates for the old ones. This far it was the duty of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> to go, but &s;he could not have gone farther without a violation of that duty, and it will pre&s;ently appear that &s;he had no &s;uch inten|tion.</P>
<P>It can hardly be nece&s;&s;ary to again remind the honor|able Senate of the Act of the 23d of September 1783, whereby Penn&s;ylvania, by a full and complete grant, authori&s;ed Congre&s;s to rai&s;e and levy the whole of her quota of the debt of the United States, to take effect as &s;oon as the like powers &s;hould be given by all the other &s;tates. By the Con&s;titution of the United States, the like powers were delegated to Congre&s;s by all the &s;tates,
<PB N="564" REF="027132_0572_0FD352FDC2DB8D58">
and therefore by its adoption this grant became ab&s;o|lute and irrevocable. In proof of this, I mu&s;t again have recour&s;e to the following clau&s;e, "The Congre&s;s &s;hall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, im|po&s;ts and exci&s;es, to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States."</P>
<P>As this clau&s;e transfers to Congre&s;s the identical du|ties upon which the New-Loan debt had been funded, it may with more propriety be &s;aid, that it became un|funded by the adoption of the Con&s;titution in 1788, than in by the law of 1789, &s;ince that law only renders the one of 1786 conformable to it.</P>
<P>That may idea of the New-Loan debt continuing as a debt of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> though it &s;hould become unfund|ed is not a novel one, I will now afford the mo&s;t irre|fragable proof, and my authority &s;hall be no le&s;s than that <HI>of the &s;ame Legi&s;lature which by the Act of</HI> 1786 <HI>created that debt.</HI></P>
<P>It mu&s;t be fre&s;h in the memory of every man who hears me, that when the delinquency of &s;ome of the &s;tates in their federal duties, had ari&s;en to &s;uch a height, as to almo&s;t menace a di&s;&s;olution of the Union, Con|gre&s;s &s;tood firm at their po&s;t, and exerted every nerve to pre&s;erve, or rather to re&s;cue the tainted honour of the country&mdash;On one of the&s;e trying occa&s;ions, they &s;ent a committee con&s;i&s;ting of Mr. <HI>King</HI> and Mr. <HI>Monroe</HI> to confer with the Legi&s;lature of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI> This event took place in the year 1786, and the Journals of the A&s;&s;embly of that year &s;hew what took place on that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>(Mr. <HI>Lewis</HI> then read the report, which &s;ee page 319, 320.)</P>
<P>By this it appears that a report was made by a com|mittee of the &s;ame Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly that pa&s;&s;ed the law of 1786; it was adopted by the next &s;ucceeding Hou&s;e, compo&s;ed of nearly the &s;ame members, and it recognizes &s;everal of the principles which I have advanced&mdash;"It con&s;ider the debt of the U.S. in one aggregate point

of view"&mdash;It &s;tates that the "principles of ju&s;tice re|quire, like payment of every part, whether the &s;ame be due to foreigners or citizens"&mdash;It appears that the <HI>Legi&s;lature of</HI> 1786, as well as that of 1787, thought that a "compliance with the requi&s;ition would involve a breach of the faith of this &s;tate pledged to her own citizens, UNLESS AT THE SAME TIME SOME FURTHER AND OTHER FUNDS WERE PROVIDED FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE INTEREST DUE AND WHICH SHOULD BECOME DUE TO THEM"&mdash;And this &s;urely implies that when <HI>&s;uch other funds were provided, it would be no breach of faith to take away tho&s;e which had been &s;ub&s;cribed</HI>&mdash;This clear|ly &s;eparates the a&s;&s;umption of the debt from the fund|ing of it&mdash;By the Con&s;titution of the United States, ample means of other funds were provided, and there|fore the Legi&s;lature of 1789 di&s;tingui&s;hed, as tho&s;e of 1786 and 1787 had done, <HI>between the a&s;&s;umption of the debt and the funding of it;</HI> and as <HI>they</HI> had propo&s;ed, permitted the <HI>former to remain,</HI> but took away the latter.</P>
<P>This report &s;tates the nece&s;&s;ity which the State had been under of "a&s;&s;uming the debt," and it &s;peaks of the a&s;&s;umption as being unconditional in its nature, and unlimited in point of time; but it a&s;&s;umes a very dif|ferent language when &s;peaking of the funding of the debt, for the expre&s;&s;ion there is, that "This Hou&s;e cannot divert the funds until &s;uch &s;olid provi&s;ion be made for all the public debts, as that the annual in|tere&s;t payable to <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> will be a certain and &s;ufficient fund for di&s;charging tho&s;e &s;ums, which &s;he is bound to pay to her citizens"&mdash;By the Con&s;titution of the United States &s;uch "&s;olid provi&s;ion" as is here &s;poken of was amply &s;ecured, and therefore the law of 1789 is in this particular conformable to what the Le|gi&s;lature in 1786 con&s;idered as proper under the like circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>To determine however, whether there is any thing in the letter or &s;pirit of the Act of 1789, &s;hewing an inten|tion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> de&s;troy the New-Loan debt, a nearer view of the &s;ubject mu&s;t be taken. When the bill was before the
<PB N="566" REF="027132_0574_0FD353898A1DA538">
Hou&s;e in its original &s;hape, it propo&s;ed no more than to repeal &s;o much of the law of 1786, as directed the payment of the intere&s;t half yearly, and had it retained this form it would hardly be contended that the debt it&s;elf was de&s;troyed&mdash;The cau&s;e of the alteration may however be ea&s;ily traced, and when that is known, there will appear no more rea&s;on for concluding the intention to have been to de&s;troy the debt, than if no alteration had taken place. That cau&s;e was as follows &mdash;As the intere&s;t was funded upon and made payable out of the quota of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania;</HI> and as it was proper to repeal this part of the Act, the Legi&s;lature at fir&s;t propo&s;ed to do nothing more&mdash;It was however in the progre&s;s of the bill ob&s;erved, that the principal was receivable at the Land-office, in order to form a charge again&s;t the United States, and to be deducted from the quota of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI> Hence this part of the Act was al&s;o exceptional, and a very proper object for a repealing clau&s;e. The&s;e circum&s;tances certainly afford &s;trong grounds for the conclu&s;ion, that in 1789 no|thing more was intended than to prevent any part of the quota of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> from being applied to par|tial purpo&s;es, and to leave to her future con&s;idera|tion, what funds &s;he would provide for the payment of the&s;e debts, or indeed whether &s;he would provide for them at all.</P>
<P>We have been told, Sir, that "The long and la|boured preamble to the law of 1789, &s;hews the anxiety of the Legi&s;lature to afford a ju&s;tification for what was about to be done, and that this proves a total de&s;truc|tion of the debt to have been intended." But were I to admit, that it is not the <HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI> but the <HI>length</HI> of the preamble, which affords a key for the interpreta|tion of the enacting clau&s;e, yet a very &s;trong conclu|&s;ion might fairly be drawn in favour of my con&s;truc|tion, &s;ince not one world is to be found in any part of the preamble, in favour of de&s;troying the debt, while every &s;entence of it, is calculated to &s;hew the propriety of rendering it an unfunded one.</P>
<P><PB N="567" REF="027132_0575_0FD352CAF74AB190">The preamble &s;ays, "And whereas Congre&s;s having the power to provide for the payment of the debts of the United States, no doubt can be entertained but they will with all convenient &s;peed make due provi&s;ion for the &s;ame"&mdash;and this has been relied on to &s;hew, that the intention was to de&s;troy the New-Loan debt altogether, but to me it appears that a very different inference is deducible.</P>
<P>The preamble recites that "Congre&s;s have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, impo&s;ts and exci&s;es; to pay the debts of the United States; that no &s;tate can without the con&s;ent of Congre&s;s lay any impo&s;ts or duties on imports or exports, and as that part of the aggregate fund created by the Act of March the 16th 1785 which ari&s;es from the duties and impo&s;ts therein mentioned, will &s;hortly cea&s;e to come into the Trea&s;ury of this &s;tate, it is rea&s;onable and ju&s;t that the temporary relief which by the &s;aid recited Acts was granted, &amp;c. &s;hould al&s;o cea&s;e."</P>
<P>In the&s;e recitals we di&s;cover no intention to annul the debt, but we &s;ee very &s;trong ones for withdrawing the funds and providing no others at that time; Congre&s;s had the power, and therefore, there could be no doubt of their having the will;&mdash;the proper funds were with|drawn from the &s;tate and ve&s;ted in Congre&s;s;&mdash;the quota of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> was re&s;tored to the proper chan|nel, and therefore the plain language of this preamble is, that as we are under no obligation to provide other funds, we will not do it at pre&s;ent, but we will give you an opportunity of receiving back your old certifi|cates, in order to apply to your original debtor for pay|ment before you &s;hall look to us who are but the guaran|tee.</P>
<P>Again, the preamble after reciting the law of 1786 and &s;ome former ones, &s;ays "It is rea&s;onable and ju&s;t that the <HI>alterations</HI> of the &s;aid recited laws herein after men|tioned, &s;hould be made." Can any thing &s;hew more clearly than this, that they were to be <HI>altered,</HI> not <HI>de|&s;troyed; amended,</HI> not <HI>repealed?</HI> and if &s;o, that part was to
<PB N="568" REF="027132_0576_0FD353144FD81F30">
remain, and <HI>that</HI> part is &s;o much thereof as was a&s;|&s;umed debt.</P>
<P>But further &s;ays the preamble; "It is rea&s;onable and ju&s;t that the <HI>temporary</HI> relief granted by the &s;aid recited Acts &s;hould cea&s;e." Let us &s;ee, Mr. Speaker, what this temporary relief was, and when we know this we &s;hall have the Legi&s;lature's own declaration of what was deemed rea&s;onable and ju&s;t to do&mdash;The princi|pal was made payable at the end of ten years, but it was not &s;ecured on any grounds; this was hard upon the creditors, who had long &s;ought in vain for their ju&s;t rights&mdash;The finances of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> did not admit of her promi&s;ing payment of the principal at an earlier period, nor of fixing on any funds even for that time; &mdash;but in con&s;ideration of their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, &s;he granted them <HI>temporary relief,</HI> and that temporary relief was,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The payment of the intere&s;t half yearly during ten years but no longer; and,</P>
<P N="2">2d. As &s;he wi&s;hed to di&s;po&s;e of her back lands, and found much difficulty in doing it, &s;he agreed to receive New-Loan certificates at the Land-office in payment for her back lands.</P>
<P>And &s;he provided that both of the&s;e &s;hould be charg|ed again&s;t the United States and be deducted from her quota&mdash;We now &s;ee what this <HI>temporary relief</HI> was, which it <HI>was rea&s;onable and ju&s;t &s;hould cea&s;e;</HI> we find that it had no relation to the validity of the certificate; that it was confined to payments out of the quota of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania;</HI> and after this, the con&s;truction mu&s;t be a very &s;trained one indeed, which &s;uppo&s;es that the Legi&s;lature thought it rea&s;onable and ju&s;t that the cer|tificates <HI>&s;hould be cancelled and the debt aboli&s;hed!</HI>&mdash;Had &s;uch been the intention, would not the preamble have &s;aid &s;o? Or could &s;uch be the intention, when the lan|guage is &s;o very different?&mdash;To <HI>cea&s;e,</HI> and to <HI>aboli&s;h,</HI> are different things, in the one ca&s;e the thing which cea&s;ed may begin again: in the other it is de&s;troyed and gone forever.&mdash;But if this were not &s;o, yet it is only the <HI>temporary relief</HI> which was to cea&s;e, and we
<PB N="569" REF="027132_0577_0FD35300BA095C60">
we have &s;een what that temporary relief was. The words temporary relief, can with no kind of propriety be applied to a debt made payable <HI>at the di&s;tance of ten years,</HI> without any funds being provided for its di&s;charge at that time, or means of compelling the Legi&s;lature to provide them at all. The words <HI>future</HI> relief might be applicable to &s;uch a ca&s;e, but I have not a very clear idea of that kind of temporary relief which I mu&s;t wait ten years for, and I therefore conclude that it was not intended to aboli&s;h the debt it&s;elf. The rea&s;on a&s;|&s;igned for repealing certain parts of the Act of 1786, may be a good one, but it is no rea&s;on for a total &s;ilence re&s;pecting that part of the law of 1786, which a&s;&s;um|ed the debt, if a repeal of it was really intended.</P>
<P>I &s;ay a <HI>total &s;ilence,</HI> re&s;pecting the <HI>a&s;&s;umption,</HI> for I can find nothing at all re&s;pecting it, in the clau&s;e in que&s;tion.&mdash;Let us, Mr. Speaker, pay a little more minute attention, to the&s;e <HI>all-powerful</HI> words,&mdash; "So much of every Act, &amp;c. as <HI>directs or &s;ecures</HI> the <HI>payment of the principal &s;um or of the intere&s;t,</HI> beyond the term of four years, &s;hall be, and the &s;ame is hereby repealed, and made null and void."</P>
<P>Unle&s;s the&s;e words de&s;troy the debt, it is not pre|tended, that there is any thing in the Act of 1789 which can have that effect&mdash;The words "&s;o much as <HI>directs the payment of the principal or intere&s;t,"</HI> can with no kind of propriety be &s;aid to have the lea&s;t operation in the way contended.&mdash;<HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> by her Act of 1786 <HI>directed</HI> her proper officer, to pay the intere&s;t half yearly, until the end of the ten years, out of her quo|ta of the debt of the United States; &s;he al&s;o directed her proper officer to pay the principal out of the &s;ame quota at her Land-office, to &s;uch per&s;ons as might be willing to accept of payment in that way; but &s;he <HI>di|rected</HI> no other payment to be made, nor did &s;he make any provi&s;ion for it. In 1789 &s;he <HI>directed</HI> that the&s;e payments &s;hould cea&s;e, and &s;he did this with great propriety, becau&s;e the&s;e payments in the manner <HI>di|rected,</HI> and out of a fund not <HI>at her di&s;po&s;al,</HI> were at
<PB N="570" REF="027132_0578_0FD3534A0633A968">
all times &s;o improper, that no Act of hers could render them legal.</P>
<P>It is therefore clear that this part of the clau&s;e, does not afford even the &s;emblance of rea&s;on, for the &s;trange &s;uppo&s;ition that the law of 1789 meant to <HI>de&s;troy</HI> the debt, or to do any thing more than to <HI>unfund</HI> it, be|cau&s;e, if the expre&s;&s;ion be allowable, it had been <HI>fund|ed,</HI> on <HI>funds,</HI> which &s;he had no right to <HI>fund</HI> it upon.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid, that the Act of 1789, not only re|pealed &s;o much of the Act of 1786, as <HI>directed</HI> pay|ment, &amp;c. but al&s;o &s;o much of it as <HI>&s;ecured</HI> payment; and it is contended that whatever the con&s;truction may be of the former expre&s;&s;ion, that the latter will admit of nothing le&s;s than an ab&s;olute annihilation of the debt.</P>
<P>This &s;eems, Sir, to be con&s;idered by our enemies as their &s;trong ground, but I neverthele&s;s believe that they may without difficulty be driven from it by regular ap|proaches and fair argument, and I &s;hall proceed in this way, with full confidence of &s;ucce&s;s and of complete victory.</P>
<P>"SO MUCH AS SECURE PAYMENT"&mdash;What do the&s;e words imply? Why that &s;o much of the Act of 1786 as provided the means or afforded &s;ecurity for payment &s;hould be repealed. But how far did it provide the means or afford &s;ecurity or give a pledge for payment? Why it gave and it pledged as &s;ecurity for payment of the intere&s;t for ten years, the quota of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> of the debt of the United States&mdash;The repeal of this part of the law of 1786 which only related to the intere&s;t, has &s;urely nothing to do with the de&s;truction of the principal&mdash;But it may be &s;aid, that it al&s;o gave as a pledge or &s;ecurity for redeeming the principal, the right of paying the New-Loan certificates at the Land-office in exchange for vacant lands.&mdash;Admitting that the pay|ment of the principal was in this manner not only <HI>di|rected,</HI> but <HI>&s;ecured,</HI> what is the con&s;equence of a repeal of this provi&s;ion of &s;ecurity? Why &s;urely not an an|nihilation of the debt; or any thing more than a legi&s;|lative declaration that however ju&s;t, legal and la&s;ting
<PB N="571" REF="027132_0579_0FD352CC3A860A58">
the debt may be, the payment of it &s;hall not be <HI>&s;ecured</HI> in this particular way, becau&s;e it was not in the power of the Legi&s;lature of 1786 to &s;ecure the payment out of her quota, and therefore &s;o far as that Act &s;ecures the payment we repeal it becau&s;e it &s;ecured payment from funds not belonging to or at the di&s;po&s;al of <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania.</HI></P>
<P>Did the Act of 1786 &s;ecure payment in any other manner than has been mentioned? &s;urely not&mdash;It mu&s;t I think be admitted, that an a&s;&s;umption of a debt by a &s;overeign and independent &s;tate, without funding it, or providing any means for payment, does not &s;ecure its payment; &s;ince there is no office to apply to for payment;&mdash;no officer directed to make payment;&mdash;no funds provided from which payment is to be made;&mdash; no means of compelling the commonwealth to provide &s;uch funds; no proce&s;s by which &s;he is ameanable to her own citizens; or in &s;hort any po&s;&s;ible mode whereby the creditor can, independant of the will and plea&s;ure of the &s;tate, be &s;ecure in his payment under &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances. If this is really the ca&s;e, and I can perceive no room for doubting it, the conclu&s;ion nece&s;&s;arily follows, that the payment of the New-Loan debt was only &s;e|cured by the law of 1786 on the quota of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and that the withdrawing of that &s;ecurity did not de&s;|troy the debt, altho' it was left without the means of payment until &s;ome other means &s;hould be provided&mdash; Whether &s;uch means were afterwards provided or not, will be a que&s;tion of &s;ub&s;equent enquiry.</P>
<P>If the payment of the principal and intere&s;t of the New-Loan debt was &s;ecured, <HI>other than has been men|tioned,</HI> it mu&s;t have been &s;ecured in <HI>&s;ome particular way or manner;</HI> for to &s;ay that a <HI>thing is done,</HI> but that it is <HI>not done in any particular way or manner;</HI> would be to talk a language which no rational man will do.&mdash;We very well know in <HI>what way and in what manner,</HI> the payment of the intere&s;t was &s;ecured; and we al&s;o know in <HI>what way,</HI> and in <HI>what manner</HI> the payment of the principal at the Land-Office was &s;ecured; but we know
<PB N="572" REF="027132_0580_0FD3532DA946DD30">
of no other way or manner in which either of them was &s;ecured, and of <HI>cour&s;e they were not &s;ecured at all.</HI></P>
<P>It is contended indeed, that the i&s;&s;uing of the certifi|cates, was &s;ecuring the payment of them; and we ad|mit the truth of of the po&s;ition &s;o far as funds were provided and pledged for that purpo&s;e, but beyond this we &s;ay it is not tenable. There is &s;urely a wide difference between <HI>evidence</HI> of a debt, and <HI>&s;ecurity</HI> for its payment, and the one may exi&s;t without the other. This doctrine may be well exemplified by ca&s;es which have been determined under the &s;tatutes of limitation. If I have a note of hand of &s;o long &s;tanding, as that a recovery is barred by any of the&s;e &s;tatutes, it is evidence of my debt, but it does not &s;ecure the payment, becau&s;e I can have no remedy to enforce a recovery. The debt is not however de&s;troyed under the&s;e circum&s;tances, but &s;till exi&s;ts, and if the debtor by his will provides a <HI>fund</HI> for the payment of his debts <HI>generally,</HI> and directs his executor to pay them out of that fund, without making any particular mention of &s;uch as are barred by lenghth of time, I am now intitled to payment. Ju&s;t &s;o it is, I apprehend, with re&s;pect to certificates in the ca&s;e put by our opponents. The certificate is evidence of the debt, and if it be a funded one, it is <HI>&s;ecurity</HI> for its payment; otherwi&s;e not, until future means of payment are provided, becau&s;e until then there is no po&s;&s;ible mode of <HI>compelling payment,</HI> and without this, it is idle to talk, of, <HI>the certificates &s;ecuring payment!</HI> &mdash;Ju&s;t &s;o was the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to the <HI>unfunded</HI> de|preciation certificates&mdash; It is admitted that they were evidences of a debt, altho' they did not <HI>&s;ecure the pay|ment</HI> of that debt, for the rea&s;ons mentioned. Ju&s;t &s;o was the ca&s;e too with re&s;pect to the old paper-money or bills of credit if they were not funded; and ju&s;t &s;o it is with re&s;pect to all unfunded debts of every de&s;cription. The debt exi&s;ts and the certificate, &amp;c. is evidence of it, but it does not &s;ecure its payment.</P>
<P>It has been relied on, Sir, as a conclu&s;ive and un|an&s;werable
<PB N="573" REF="027132_0581_0FD3538AC9DE2368">
argument again&s;t the defendant, "That the Act of 1786 authori&s;ed the doing of but three things.</P>
<P N="1">"1&s;t. The receiving the certificates of the United States upon loan.</P>
<P N="2">"2d. The i&s;&s;uing of State certificates in lieu of, or exchange for them; and,</P>
<P N="3">"3d. The payment of the New-Loan debt, or the &s;ums mentioned in the State &s;ecurities.</P>
<P>"And that as the fir&s;t and &s;econd of the&s;e things had been done, there was nothing for the Act of 1789 to operate upon, but the de&s;truction of the New-Loan debt, and therefore that its de&s;truction mu&s;t have been intended."</P>
<P>Whether this rea&s;oning is ingenious or not, is not worth an enquiry, &s;ince if it is not <HI>valid,</HI> it cannot af|fect the defendant, and his coun&s;el have no objection to yielding the palm of ingenuity to their learned friends but adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>That it is not &s;olid, and I wi&s;h to prove nothing el&s;e, will I think appear from the following ob&s;erva|tions&mdash;However true it may be, that the Act of 1786 directed but three things; yet it is equally true, that it directed and &s;ecured the la&s;t of them to be done in a way which it had no right to do, and therefore, the Act of 1789 with great propriety repealed &s;o much of the Act of 1786 as directed or &s;ecured payment; &s;ince <HI>that</HI> direction and <HI>that</HI> &s;ecurity, were founded on a breach of faith, and were beyond the power of <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania</HI> to give.</P>
<P>Nor is it true, that in the year 1789 the Legi&s;lature had nothing to do, but to de&s;troy the New-Loan debt altogether, or to permit its continuance, by &s;uf|fering payment to be made in the manner, and out of the funds provided by the Act of 1786&mdash;In 1789 the following que&s;tions pre&s;ented them&s;elves to the Legi&s;|lature:</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Shall the payments <HI>directed</HI> and <HI>&s;ecured</HI> by the Act of 1786, our of a fund which did not belong to
<PB N="574" REF="027132_0582_0FD35315DC970BC8">
<HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> to be continued, <HI>out of that fund?</HI> And the an&s;wer was; <HI>no.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2d. Shall &s;uch payments cea&s;e for the pre&s;ent, ina&s;|much as they can no longer be made out of that fund, which by her voluntary Act &s;he is now deprived of? and the an&s;wer was <HI>yes.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3d. Shall &s;o much of the debt as &s;hall remain due in the year 1796 be now funded and provided for? and the an&s;wer was that as Congre&s;s have the power and the means of payment, there can be no doubt of their compliance, and therefore, that <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> depriv|ed as &s;he is, of the revenues ari&s;ing from impo&s;ts, on imports and exports, will &s;top payment at pre&s;ent, and con&s;ider in future the propriety of its revival, or final|ly; Shall the debt be cancelled and de&s;troyed?</P>
<P>This la&s;t; this bold and de&s;perae; this &s;candalous and perfiduous; this uncon&s;titutional and impious mea|&s;ure, the Legi&s;lature of 1789, did not dare, nor was it &s;o currupt as to adopt&mdash;but it adopted a mea&s;ure not only free from perfidy and impiety, but in &s;trict con|formity with its federal duties;&mdash;<HI>that</HI> of withdrawing the <HI>&s;tolen</HI> funds provided for payment, and it carefully avoided the commi&s;&s;ion of a new breach of faith, by cancelling the a&s;&s;umption, at the very moment of atton|ing for a former one, by re&s;toring the pilfered property.</P>
<P>Had the Legi&s;lature of 1789 contemplated the <HI>im|puted</HI> nefarious de&s;ign, its language would have been plain and explicit, and the abolition of the New-Loan debt, would (in ca&s;e of a non re-exchange) have been declared in terms clear and unequivocal; unle&s;s in|deed we are to &s;uppo&s;e the Legi&s;lature of 1789, to have been no le&s;s corrupt than one branch of the pre&s;ent Legi&s;lature, &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e the Legi&s;lature of 1786 to have been&mdash;but of this hereafter.</P>
<P>In order to prove, that a total de&s;truction of the New-Loan debt was intended by the Act of 1789, and that this was within the power of the Legi&s;lature, it has been warmly urged, that the Act of 1786 was ori|ginally
<PB N="575" REF="027132_0583_0FD352DE4AAF07F8">
intended to be, of but &s;hort duration; and to give colour to this doctrine, the words <HI>"temporary relief,"</HI> which appear in the Act of 1789 have, with|out being under&s;tood, been perverted to an&s;wer this purpo&s;e. The gentlemen tell us that the&s;e words fur|ni&s;h a Legi&s;lative con&s;truction in their favor, and that this being the ca&s;e, the honorable Senate have nothing to do but to abide by that con&s;truction; a con&s;truction &s;ay they, which &s;hews that <HI>Penn&s;ylvnnia</HI> meant to re|&s;erve the right of <HI>aboli&s;hing</HI> the New-Loan debt at plea|&s;ure, and of <HI>demanding</HI> the new certificates in exchange for the old ones.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, Mr. Speaker, to have occa&s;ion for ob&s;erv|ing, that white the Repre&s;entatives of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> affect &s;o much anxiety for her rights, as to give daily attendance here, they are &s;o carele&s;s of her honor, as to remain <HI>unmoved,</HI> while that honor is &s;o deeply wound|ed by their honorable managers and learned coun&s;el! Do the&s;e words appear in the law of 1786? They do not. Is not the con&s;truction of a law to be &s;ought for in the law it&s;elf? It certainly <HI>is.</HI> Would not this kind of rea&s;oning authori&s;e the pa&s;&s;ing of "an <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> law, of law impairing the obligation of contracts on every occa&s;ion? It certainly would, by declaring the former one, to have been intended but as a <HI>temporary one!</HI> Does the law of 1786 contain a &s;ingle word which can po&s;&s;ibly lead to &s;uch a con&s;truction? It does <HI>not.</HI> Does every certificate i&s;&s;ued under that law, contain an ab&s;olute and unconditional promi&s;e for payment, at all events? and does that law expre&s;sly direct that they &s;hall contain &s;uch a promi&s;e? The&s;e things <HI>cannot be denied.</HI> Are not all &s;uch certificates transferrable and made payable to bearer? They <HI>are,</HI> If <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> meant to re&s;erve the rights contended for under the <HI>benign au&s;pices</HI> of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, was it honourable? was it candid? was it fair? or to make u&s;e of more proper language; if &s;he had &s;uch <HI>covert views,</HI> was it not fraud; perfidy; ba&s;ene&s;s in the extreme! to direct the i&s;&s;uing of certificates, which
<PB N="576" REF="027132_0584_0FD3534BC7099320">
on the face of them contained an ab&s;olute and uncon|ditional promi&s;e for payment? Let tho&s;e who counte|nance &s;uch a con&s;truction an&s;wer the&s;e que&s;tons! But the words <HI>"temporary relief,"</HI> u&s;ed in the Act of 1789 <HI>only</HI> relate, as has already been &s;hewn, to the <HI>temporary</HI> payment of intere&s;t, and the <HI>temporary</HI> di&s;charge of the principal and intere&s;t at the Land-office. This <HI>tempo|rary relief only,</HI> was to cea&s;e; no other temporary re|lief was afforded; and therefore nothing can be more clear, than that every thing beyond this temporary re|lief was to continue.</P>
<P>But the gentlemen tell us "That the Act of 1786 was but a &s;ub&s;titute for the Act of 1785, and as one was temporary &s;o was the other."&mdash;This kind of logic may perhaps do very well in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;ent|atives, when Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> is the object, but it will not go down here&mdash;If it &s;hould prevail it will prove that no &s;ub&s;equent law can be of longer duration than a preceding one! It will prove that the law of 1785, being a &s;ub&s;titute for that of September 1783, could be of no longer continnuance! It will prove, that the law of Sept, 1783, being a &s;ub&s;titute for that of March 1783, could be of no longer continuance! and of cour&s;e that the law of 1786 only granted one years intere&s;t! The truth is, Mr. Speaker, that all new laws on the &s;ame &s;ubject, are intended to make different provi&s;ion, of &s;ome kind or other from the former ones, and it generally hap|pens, that the fir&s;t law is limited to a &s;hort period, but that after experience has manife&s;ted its utility, the li|mitation is taken off, and it is, with the nece&s;&s;ary al|terations, made perpetual. On this principle we find that when <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> meant to afford temporary re|lief <HI>only;</HI> &s;he &s;aid &s;o; but that when &s;he meant that her law &s;hould be <HI>perpetual,</HI> &s;he did not think proper to <HI>limit it,</HI> as &s;he had formerly done.</P>
<P>The &s;ame kind of logic, Sir, makes its appearance again, and we are next told, "That as the public cre|ditors had no more merit in the year 1786, than they had in the year 1785, there could be no rea&s;on for
<PB N="577" REF="027132_0585_0FD3532F687C49D0">
granting them greater relief in the la&s;t year, than in the former one, and that it may be therefore fairly conclud|ed, that it was not intended."&mdash;To this it may be an|&s;wered, that they had no more merit in the year 1786 than they had in the year 1783, and that therefore this argument, if it proves any thing at all, proves that the law of 1786 was only intended to make provi&s;ion for one year's intere&s;t! If <HI>all</HI> Legi&s;latures, at <HI>all</HI> times, thought <HI>preci&s;ely alike,</HI> on the &s;ame &s;ubject; and if the &s;ituation of the country, the finances of the State, and <HI>all other</HI> circum&s;tances, were at <HI>all times</HI> the &s;ame, this argument might claim &s;ome attention; but as this is not the ca&s;e, it would be but a wa&s;te of time to enter upon its &s;erious refutation.</P>
<P>The truth is, that <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> only contemplated the payment of &s;o much of the debt of the United States, as was due to her own citizens, but her finances did not admit of it; &s;he therefore at fir&s;t afforded tem|porary relief, and in the year 1786 made an ab&s;olute engagement; and that ab&s;olute engagement remained, although from the circum&s;tances already mentioned, the holders of the certificates were deprived of the tem|porary relief provided for them.</P>
<P>(Here Mr. <HI>Lewis</HI> read &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in the mi|nutes of the A&s;&s;embly of the 24th of December, 1784, page 97-8-9-100-1, in order to prove that <HI>Penn&s;ylva|nia</HI> at that early period, contemplated the a&s;&s;umption of the debt due to her own citizens; and then proceed|ed as follows)&mdash;</P>
<P>We have al&s;o been told, Sir, that the Act of De|cember 1780, making up the depreciation, did not re|quire the old certificates to be given up, as the Act of 1786 did, and that therefore it was intended in 1786, that the old certificates &s;hould be delivered to the State, to be held until &s;he might think proper to demand a re-exchange; but to this the an&s;wer is ea&s;y and mu&s;t &s;atisfactory; that the Act of December 1780 did not a&s;&s;ume the debt, but only provided for making up the depreciation, and of cour&s;e, the certificates ought
<PB N="578" REF="027132_0586_0FD3533147869320">
to remain in the hands of the holders, and could with no propriety be a&s;ked for by the State.</P>
<P>Only one argument more, Mr. Speaker, connected with the pre&s;ent que&s;tion, remains to be an&s;wered, and a mo&s;t extraordinary one it is.</P>
<P>In February 1793, when the game had been &s;tarted, and the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives were in full chace, they, if the manager's con&s;truction be right, provided them&s;elves with an in&s;trument of de&s;truction, and a dreadful one it will be, unle&s;s we can di&s;arm them of it. At that time they pa&s;&s;ed a law, proving as the managers &s;ay, that the New-Loan debt was aboli&s;hed by the Act of 1789, and no longer exi&s;ted as a debt due from <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI> This was long after all the tran&s;actions had taken place on which the impeach|ment is found, it was after they had commenced their enquiries and the charges; it was at a time when they were maturing them for his conviction; and this act of his accu&s;ers is now brought forward as a Legi&s;lative con&s;truction in order to in&s;ure his conviction! Had &s;uch an Act been pa&s;&s;ed by any other &s;et of men than his accu&s;ers, and if &s;uch was their intention, it might have been imputed to the wantonne&s;s of power merely; but when it is con&s;idered that Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> could not know that &s;uch a law would pa&s;s; that it is &s;ufficient for a man to &s;quare his actions according to the exi&s;ting law; that this Act was pa&s;&s;ed by his accu&s;ers them|&s;elves; after the accu&s;ation had commenced, and is now relied on by them, in order to en&s;ure his con|viction, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> language affords not a name for &s;uch a proceeding.</P>
<P>The Roman hi&s;tory is a hi&s;tory of the <HI>tyranny</HI> of <HI>tyrants;</HI> of the <HI>de&s;poti&s;m of de&s;pots;</HI> but it is &s;ome a|pology for them, that they were unacquainted with liberty, and that &s;lavery appeared in a form le&s;s haggard from being familiar to than from the cradle. But in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> law is a rule <HI>pre&s;cribed,</HI> commanding what is right, and prohibiting what is wrong; not on|ly <HI>pre&s;cribed</HI> but <HI>promulgated</HI> made known. <HI>Cati|gula</HI>

<P>It was aboli&s;hed by the Emperor <HI>Macrinus,</HI> but ac|cording to our opponents doctrine we now &s;ee it revived in <HI>Penn&s;lyvania,</HI> even in a criminal ca&s;e; after the ac|cu&s;ation; and by the accu&s;ers!</P>
<P>If, Mr. Speaker, my principles are hitherto &s;ound, it will I think follow as a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, <HI>"That the New-Loan certificates were &s;ub&s;cribable to the loan of the</HI> United States, <HI>and of cour&s;e were redeemable at the Trea&s;ury of</HI> Penn&s;ylvania."</P>
<P>It is &s;tated, I think, by one of the Managers, that the Act of Congre&s;s of the 8th of May, 1792, is but a continuation of that of the 4th of Augu&s;t, 1790, &s;o far as relates to the pre&s;ent que&s;tion, and that the con|&s;truction of both mu&s;t be the &s;ame&mdash;That of the 4th of Augu&s;t 1790, enacts that "The &s;ums which &s;hall be &s;ub&s;cribed to the loan, &s;hall be payable in the princi|pal and intere&s;t of the certificates, or notes, which prior to 1&s;t of January la&s;t, were i&s;&s;ued by the re&s;|pective

&s;tates, as acknowledgments or evidences of debts by them re&s;pectively owing, (except certain ones of the &s;tate of <HI>North-Carolina)</HI> with a provi&s;o, that none &s;uch &s;hould be received, but &s;uch as had been i&s;|&s;ued for compen&s;ations and expenditures towards the pro&s;ecution of the late war."&mdash;What were the New-Loan certificates? Surely they were i&s;&s;ued by <HI>Penn&s;yl|vania</HI> as evidences or acknowledgements of debts.</P>
<P>But, &s;ay the gentlemen, however true this may be, yet that they were not i&s;&s;ued for compen&s;ations and ex|penditures towards the pro&s;ecution of the late war, but in lieu of other certificates.</P>
<P>What argument can be more fallacious than this? were they not i&s;&s;ued for payment of &s;uch compen&s;ations in lieu of other certificates, on which payment could not be obtained? and do they not therefore come with|in both the letter and the &s;pirit of the Act of Congre&s;s? The debts of the de&s;cription already mentioned, were due from the <HI>United States;</HI> they were unable to pay them, and <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> &s;aid to her citizens; give us your cer|tificates, that we may be reimbur&s;ed, and we will give you new ones for the payment of your compen&s;ations, and expenditures during the late war.&mdash;This was only a change of the &s;ecurity and of the per&s;on who was to pay; but the debt was the &s;ame; it was due to the &s;ame per&s;ons, and from the &s;ame cau&s;e, and the only altera|tion which took place was, that payment was to be made by <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> in&s;tead of the United States. Does this alter the nature of the debt, or the cau&s;e from which it aro&s;e? &s;urely not. Does one per&s;on becoming &s;ecu|rity for the debt of another, change the ri&s;e or origin of that debt? No man of common &s;en&s;e, will in the moments of &s;erious reflection advance &s;o wild a po&s;ition.</P>
<P>If proofs in &s;upport of this rea&s;oning are required, they are furni&s;hed by,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The implied admi&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of Repre|&s;entatives, and it is therefore rea&s;onable to conclude, that we are beholden to the <HI>ingenuity</HI> of their <HI>ingenious</HI>

<P N="2">2d. The opinion of the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, expre&s;&s;ed in his circular letter to the Commi&s;&s;ioners of Loans throughout the U. S. (See p. 272-3) in the mo&s;t clear, pointed and unequivocal terms, in our favour on this &s;ubject,&mdash;Great as that illu&s;trious character is, I do not quote his opinion as any evidence of the law; but as it appears that Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> knew of this let|ter, and as criminality of intention, is e&s;&s;ential to the commi&s;&s;ion of a crime, it is certainly material to con|&s;ider, that he knew that he was acting conformably to the opinion of the di&s;tingui&s;hed head of an important department; who in addition to his <HI>great law</HI> abilities, &s;eems to embrace a large portion of the circle of &s;cience, at a &s;ingle glance, and as it were by intuition to penetrate, develope, comprehend, and to be able in a moment to elucidate every minute part of each of them. &mdash;If however opinion is to be re&s;orted to; I a&s;k of what weight can the opinion of the whole Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives be, when weighed again&s;t that of Colo|nel <HI>Hamilton? Alexander</HI> the copper&s;mith, if com|pared with <HI>Alexander</HI> the great, would not form &s;o &s;trik|ing a contra&s;t.</P>
<P>And 3dly. Congre&s;s by their law of the 4th of Au|gu&s;t 1790, expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves in &s;uch clear and point|ed language in this particular, as mu&s;t entirely obviate the objection and force conviction, even on the minds of infidels&mdash;In declaring what debts &s;hould be &s;ub&s;crib|able, they by the 13th &s;ect. of that law enacted, that "The &s;ums which &s;hould be &s;ub&s;cribed to the &s;aid loan, &s;hould be payable in the principal and intere&s;t of the certificates or notes, which prior to the 1&s;t day of January la&s;t, were i&s;&s;ued by the re&s;pect|ive &s;tates as ac|knowledgments or evidences of debts by them re&s;pect|ively owing, for compen&s;ations and expenditures, for &s;ervices or &s;upplies towards the pro&s;ecution of the late war, and the defence of the United States;" with an exception as to certain ones, i&s;&s;ued by the &s;tate of <HI>North-Carolina;</HI>
<PB N="582" REF="027132_0590_0FD35317499D97F8">
but, (17th and 18th &s;ect.) as certain &s;tates had re&s;pectively i&s;&s;ued their own certificates, in exchange for tho&s;e of the United States, whereby it might hap|pen that intere&s;t might be twice payable on the &s;ame &s;ums; it was further enacted, that the payment of in|tere&s;t, whether to &s;tates or to individuals, in re&s;pect to the debt of any &s;tate, by which &s;uch exchange &s;hould have been made, &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended, until it &s;hould appear to the &s;atisfaction of the Secretary of the Trea|&s;ury that certificates i&s;&s;ued for that purpo&s;e by &s;uch &s;tate had been re-exchanged or redeemed; or until tho&s;e which &s;hould not have been re-exchanged or redeemed &s;hould be &s;urrendered to the United States."</P>
<P>Could language be more explicit than this? Were the&s;e certificates not <HI>i&s;&s;ued as acknowledgments or evi|dences of debt?</HI> Were they not i&s;&s;ued, in lieu of others, for &s;uch <HI>compen&s;ations</HI> and <HI>expenditures</HI> as are here mentioned? Or if not; are they not &s;uch as were &s;pecially provided for by the 17th and 18th &s;ections of the law ju&s;t read? And yet &s;ay the gentlemen, they were not &s;ub&s;cribable, even independent of the repeal|ing Act of 1789! But why not &s;ub&s;cribable? Why &s;ay our opponents, becau&s;e the 17th and 18th &s;ections were in&s;erted le&s;t a <HI>very few</HI> of the New-Loan certificates, might be &s;ub&s;cribed <HI>by mi&s;take.</HI>&mdash;But is any &s;uch rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned, or can any thing like it be di&s;covered in either of the&s;e &s;ections? Surely not; but on the contrary, the rea&s;on, the letter and the &s;pirit of the law are ge|neral, and there is nothing but ingenuity to re&s;train it, to a <HI>very few ca&s;es happening by mi&s;take.</HI></P>
<P>But it is objected, that none were &s;ub&s;cribable but &s;uch as were <HI>recogni&s;ed</HI> and <HI>acknowledged</HI> by the &s;tate, and it is added, that the&s;e were rejected by the law of 1789, and could not therefore be &s;ub&s;cribable, <HI>even though that Act were void.</HI></P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer; that in no part of the Act of Con|gre&s;s, do we find, that to render a &s;tate debt &s;ub&s;crib|able to the loan of the United States; it mu&s;t be <HI>recog|ni&s;ed</HI> and <HI>acknowledged</HI> by the &s;tate. The words are,

"Shall be payable in certificates, i&s;&s;ued by the re&s;pect|ive &s;tates, as acknowledgments and evidences of debts by them owing"&mdash;The&s;e certificates were i&s;&s;ued by the &s;tate of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> as <HI>acknowledgments and evidences</HI> of debts by her owing, and if the&s;e debts &s;till continue, they are <HI>acknowledgments</HI> and <HI>evidences</HI> thereof, and of cour&s;e are &s;ub&s;cribable, whether &s;he now chu&s;es to <HI>re|cogni&s;e</HI> and <HI>acknowledge</HI> them or not. Can a debtor, by refu&s;ing to <HI>recogni&s;e</HI> and acknowledge a debt, alter the nature of that debt, or le&s;&s;en his obligation to pay it? Let us, Mr. Speaker, examine this doctrine a little further&mdash;The gentlemen &s;ay, that the&s;e debts were not &s;ub&s;cribable, <HI>even though the law of</HI> 1789 <HI>were void;</HI> becau&s;e the pa&s;&s;ing of it, &s;hewed, that it was not the <HI>will</HI> of the &s;tate to <HI>recogni&s;e</HI> and <HI>acknowledge</HI> them&mdash; The <HI>law of the &s;tate</HI> is the <HI>will of that State.</HI> and no|thing <HI>&s;hort of that law, can manife&s;t that will.</HI> The law is the only <HI>organ</HI> by which the &s;tate can expre&s;s her will, and &s;he cannot do it in any other way&mdash;&s;he can <HI>recogni&s;e</HI> nothing; &s;he can <HI>acknowledge</HI> nothing, but by her law&mdash;By the law of 1786 &s;he <HI>recogni&s;ed;</HI> &s;he <HI>acknowledged</HI> the New-Loan debt, and her <HI>will</HI> being manife&s;ted upon that occa&s;ion, cannot be withdrawn, nor can her <HI>recognition</HI> or <HI>acknowledgment</HI> cea&s;e, unle&s;s &s;he had <HI>power to repeal,</HI> and actually <HI>did repeal</HI> the a&s;|&s;umption of the New Loan debt&mdash;yet we are told that the Act of 1789 <HI>even if null and void, and not the law of the State, manife&s;ted the will of the State!</HI>&mdash;It has been added, Sir, "That the late Hou&s;e of impeach|ment, by voting, that the law of 1789 rendered the New-Loan certificates no longer a debt, or evidence of a debt due from <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> &s;hewed that <HI>Penn&s;ylva|nia</HI> did not acknowledge the debt, and that therefore it not &s;ub&s;cribable:" If, Sir, that Hou&s;e <HI>(but a &s;in|gle branch of the Legi&s;lature)</HI> pa&s;&s;ed that vote, with the intention, that this u&s;e &s;hould be made of it, the guilty Members ought to have &s;tood, where Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> now does, and received at lea&s;t as heavy a puni&s;hment as can be demanded upon him&mdash;I freely aquit them

however of any &s;uch intention, while I mu&s;t expre&s;s my a&s;toni&s;hment, at the attempt which has been made!</P>
<P>But we are told that "The Governor and the other of|ficers of government do not recogni&s;e the debt, and therefore the debt was not &s;ub&s;cribable."&mdash;What &s;trange doctrine, Sir, have I now to encounter! What right has the Governor, or any officer of government, to <HI>recogni&s;e</HI> or to <HI>reject</HI> any thing, but what is <HI>recogni&s;ed or rejected by the law?</HI>&mdash;If by a &s;olemn exi&s;ting law, the debt is recogni&s;ed, can that be prevented by the Governor's will?&mdash;Suppo&s;e his will, and the will of the &s;tate, ex|pre&s;&s;ed by her law, to be different, which mu&s;t pre|vail? If the doctrine contended for is true, the defend|ant &s;hould have been impeached, for acting, not again&s;t law, but again&s;t the opinion or will of the Governor&mdash; or perhaps, again&s;t the opinion or will of the Attorney-General, which in que&s;tions of law, directs the opinion or will of the Governor, and who is now of coun&s;el again&s;t Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on!</HI></P>
<P>Let us next, Sir, examine the opinion of the late Attorney-General of the U. S. &s;ince it has been given in evidence, and relied on by the pro&s;ecutors. (See p. 81-2.)</P>
<P>Without taking the objection, as I certainly might, that in point of law, this opinion is not legal evi|dence, I &s;hall wave the objection; &s;ince it will pre|&s;ently appear, that the opinion is &s;o <HI>harmle&s;s,</HI> as to be of no con&s;equence either way&mdash;The public di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the propriety of an opinion, of a brother practition|er, is an unplea&s;ing ta&s;k, but when it is given in evi|dence, in order to &s;hew what the law is, it becomes as fair an object of free examination, as the opinion of a Judge when under examination upon a writ of error.</P>
<P>The late Attorney-General <HI>was</HI> "of opinion that the New-Loan certificates were aboli&s;hed by the Acts of the 27th March, 1789, and the 20<HI>th of March,</HI> and 1&s;t of April, 1790," but as no Act of any kind was pa&s;&s;ed on the 20<HI>th of March,</HI> 1790, except one for the &s;ale of the barracks at <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> and another for re|ducing the tax upon writs, it is fair to conclude, that
<PB N="585" REF="027132_0593_0FD352F7CFA31CE0">
this opinion was given, without much <HI>enquiry, and up|on but very little con&s;ideration.</HI> This &s;uppo&s;ition is ren|dered more than probable, when we con&s;ider, that in the cour&s;e of the trial, it has been often &s;tated and ne|ver denied, that the &s;ame gentleman afterwards gave and I pre&s;ume on more mature reflection) an opinion on the &s;ame point, on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion! The la&s;t opinion, tho' often called for, does not ap|pear.&mdash;We have traced it to the hands of the commit|tee of impeachments, and as it is &s;tated without contra|diction to be in favor of Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> it may not per|haps have been thought <HI>worth pre&s;erving.</HI></P>
<P>In the opinion which does appear, he begins with &s;aying&mdash;"What may be the re&s;ult of a conte&s;t between the holders of tho&s;e certificates, and the &s;tate of <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania,</HI> I pre&s;ume not to determine&mdash;But that be|tween the United States, and that State I have no dif|ficulty in deciding," and he concludes by &s;aying&mdash;"I am of opinion, that the Acts of the 27th March, 1789, and of the 30th of March, and 1&s;t of April 1790, abo|li&s;hed the&s;e certificates as debts of the &s;tate, except for the purpo&s;e of being re-exchanged for Continental certificates, and therefore that the former, as wanting the due recognition from that State, cannot be legally received upon loan."</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to comprehend, and it is &s;till more dif|ficult to reconcile the various parts of this opinion&mdash; Mr. <HI>Randolph</HI> &s;eems not to have been able to <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h the premi&s;es</HI> either way, but to have been very capable of <HI>drawing his conclu&s;ion,</HI> with great clearne&s;s. If a con|clu&s;ion without premi&s;es, is to be regarded, the weight of his authority is again&s;t us, but if premi&s;es are e&s;|&s;ential to a conclu&s;ion, it will be found that his opinion can be of no weight at all.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, Sir, that Mr. <HI>Randolph</HI> drew his con|clu&s;ion without determining on the premi&s;es, and that this was the ca&s;e will &s;ufficiently appear from the fol|lowing remarks&mdash;"What may be the re&s;ult," &s;ays he, "of a conte&s;t, between the holders of tho&s;e certificates,
<PB N="586" REF="027132_0594_0FD35332D397ABB8">
and the &s;tate of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania, I pre&s;ume not to determine,"</HI> and I undertake to prove that without fir&s;t determining this, or at lea&s;t forming an opinion of the law on the &s;ubject, it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to give an opinion on the que&s;tion &s;ubmitted to him, or to draw any conclu|&s;ion whatever. The que&s;tion of law was preci&s;ely the &s;ame, between the then holders of the certificates, and the &s;tate of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> as it would be, between the United States, (&s;hould they become the holders) and <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI>&mdash;The certificates were transferrable and payable to bearer; if therefore they were <HI>valid</HI> in the hands of the then holders, they would be equally &s;o, when in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the United States; but if they were not <HI>valid</HI> in the hands of the then holders, neither could they be &s;o, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Unit|ed States. Mr. <HI>Randolph</HI> however finds the que&s;tion &s;o difficult, as between the then holders, and the &s;tate of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> that he cannot, or will not pre&s;ume to de|termine it, but he is neverthele&s;s clear in his opinion in favour of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> on the que&s;tion between her and the United States, &s;hould they become the holders or bearers of the certificates. Nothing can I think more fully expo&s;e the impropriety of this opinion than the ca&s;e which I am about to put.</P>
<P>In <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> a bond is transferrable by a&s;&s;ignment; the&s;e certificates were transferrable by delivery. Sup|po&s;e I have a bond from my debtor, who refu&s;es pay|ment on the ground of its having been already di&s;|charged&mdash;This he alledges to be the ca&s;e; as <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> does with re&s;pect to the certificates under con&s;ideration, and I deny it, as is done by the certificate-holders.&mdash;If I am right, I have a legal claim upon him; and &s;o have the holders of certificates if they are right, upon the &s;tate; but if I am wrong, I have no &s;uch legal claim; in like manner if the holders of the certificates are wrong, they have no &s;uch legal claim&mdash;If I a&s;&s;ign the bond, my a&s;&s;ignee has as good a claim as I had, and in like manner, if the holders of the certificates transfer them to the United States, the United States cannot be
<PB N="587" REF="027132_0595_0FD3538C43886758">
in a wor&s;e &s;ituation than the holders were&mdash;There are many ca&s;es in the law, where the a&s;&s;ignee or indor&s;ee is in a better &s;ituation than the original payee was, but there is no ca&s;e in which that &s;ituation can be wor&s;e: yet Mr. <HI>Randolph</HI> determines again&s;t the transferree, tho' he can|not undertake to &s;ay, what the law may be between the original parties!</P>
<P>Again, Sir; he is of "opinion, that the Acts al|ready mentioned, aboli&s;hed the certificates as debts of the State, except for the purpo&s;e of being re-exchang|ed," and yet he will not pre&s;ume to determine the que&s;tion! How can he be of opinion that they are abo|li&s;hed, if he can give no opinion between the holders and the State! Since the que&s;tion of abolition, alto|gether depends on a right opinion being formed as be|tween the holders and the State!</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Sir, the different parts of this opinion are entirely at variance, and the learned gentleman who gave it, appears to have had <HI>"no difficulty in deciding"</HI> while he "could <HI>not pre&s;ume to determine!"</HI></P>
<P>It concludes by &s;aying, "and therefore the former, to wit, the New-Loan certificates, as wanting the <HI>due recognition</HI> from the State, cannot be legally received upon loan!"&mdash;What is meant by the&s;e words, <HI>"as wanting the due recognition from the State"</HI> I cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;ay, &s;ince the gentleman who made u&s;e of them, "will not pre&s;ume to give an opinion on the exi&s;ting law of the State, as between her and the holders of the certificates&mdash;She cannot, as already ob&s;erved, <HI>recogni&s;e</HI> them in any other way than by law, and without form|ing an opinion on the law, it is to me inconceivable how an opinion can be formed, that they want her <HI>due</HI> recognition&mdash;If the former parts of the opinion were at variance, this &s;eems to be altogether incomprehen&s;i|ble!</P>
<P>Had the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury been ve&s;ted with unlimited di&s;cretionary powers, to admit of, or reject &s;uch &s;ub&s;criptions as might be offered, and had this opinion been intended to direct a prudent exerci&s;e of
<PB N="588" REF="027132_0596_0FD353DE04E81A80">
&s;uch powers, it might perhaps have been le&s;s excep|tionable&mdash;But no di&s;cretion was left to him; the law of Congre&s;s was <HI>expre&s;s and mandatory upon him,</HI> to admit of the &s;ub&s;cription of all &s;uch debts as were within its meaning.</P>
<P>Caution in doubtful ca&s;es was nece&s;&s;ary, and the tak|of legal advice was prudent, but if he erred, and under any advice whatever, refu&s;ed &s;ub&s;criptions, which the law authori&s;ed, he would have been compelled by a <HI>mendamus</HI> from the Supreme Court of the United States, to admit of &s;uch &s;ub&s;criptions.</P>
<P>Nor had the State of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> as has been pre|tended, any thing to do with the New-Loan certificates being &s;ub&s;cribed or not; any more than a per&s;on, who &s;ub&s;cribes a note, or executes a bond, has the right of ordering, or preventing an a&s;&s;ignment.</P>
<P>Wherever the &s;ecurity is by law transferable, it be|longs to the holder of it, and to him <HI>only,</HI> if he can find a purcha&s;er, to &s;ay, whether he will part with it or not&mdash;If the &s;uppo&s;ed debtor means to conte&s;t pay|ment, he may do it after the transfer, as well as before, and in mo&s;t ca&s;es on the &s;ame principles. The &s;ub|&s;cribing of the the New-Loan debt, to the loan of the United States re&s;ted entirely with <HI>them,</HI> and the hold|ers of the certificates&mdash;If the debt was not due by <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> &s;uch &s;ub&s;cription could not affect her; if it was due, &s;he could not prevent the &s;ub&s;cription, and of cour&s;e the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for the New-Loan debt not being &s;ub&s;cribable to the loan of the United States, becau&s;e it wanted the due <HI>recognition</HI> of the State of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> is altogether unfounded. I there|fore think, that the opinion of the late Attorney-Gene|ral, may with great propriety, be thrown into the old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ard-room of the Senate, as mere u&s;ele&s;s lumber!</P>
<P>I &s;hall take no notice Sir of the Act of the 1&s;t of April, 1790, becau&s;e, tho' relied on by the late Attor|ney-General, as one of the Acts which aboli&s;hed the New-Loan debt, I do not &s;ee how it can po&s;&s;ibly affect the que&s;tion in the &s;malle&s;t degree. What he has &s;aid

re&s;pecting that Act, as well as a &s;uppo&s;ed one of the 30th of March, 1790, &s;ufficiently &s;hews however, that he did not think, the New-Loan debt was aboli&s;hed by the Act of 1789. His words are "I am of opini|on that the Acts of the <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> A&s;&s;embly of the 27th March, 1789, and of the 30th March, and 1&s;t of April, 1790, aboli&s;hed the&s;e certificates as debts of the &s;tate, &amp;c."&mdash;This &s;urely amounts to a declaration that they were <HI>not aboli&s;hed,</HI> as has been contended <HI>by the Act of</HI> 1789, <HI>only;</HI> for if they were aboli&s;hed by that Act, they could not po&s;&s;ibly be aboli&s;hed by the three Acts taken together, nor could either of the two la&s;t operate in the &s;malle&s;t degree towards <HI>aboli&s;hing</HI> a thing which had been <HI>aboli&s;hed</HI> before&mdash;It follows then, that unle&s;s two la&s;t Acts operate in &s;ome degree towards <HI>aboli&s;h|ing</HI> the certificates, they are not, on Mr. <HI>Randolph's</HI> con&s;truction of the Act of 1789, aboli&s;hed at this day; but as the only Acts which were pa&s;&s;ed on the 30th of March, 1790 related to the &s;ale of the barracks and re|ducing the tax upon writs, they could have no effect in the way contended. The Act of the 1&s;t of April, 1790 is altogether &s;ilent on the &s;ubject, and no man who reads the whole of it, can fix on any part, which tends in the &s;malle&s;t degree, to aboli&s;h either the certi|ficates or the debt. If then it is true, as admitted by Mr. <HI>Randolph,</HI> that the Act of 1789 did not <HI>of it&s;elf</HI> the debt, and if neither that of the 30th of March, nor of the 1&s;t of April, 1790, came in aid of it, Mr. <HI>Randolph's</HI> opinion &s;hould, on his own princi|ples, have been, that the certificates were not <HI>aboli&s;hed.</HI></P>
<P>It has in the next place been alledged, that "The New-Loan certificates, even tho' not aboli&s;hed, were not &s;ub&s;cribable to the loan of the United States," be|cau&s;e, &s;ay the gentlemen, "They did not bear intere&s;t" but unfortunately for them, they are no le&s;s mi&s;taken here, than in any of their former points: The certifi|cates and the law under which they were i&s;&s;ued declare, that they &s;hall bear an intere&s;t of &s;ix per cent. and al|tho' the law of 1789 prevented the holders from re|ceiving
<PB N="590" REF="027132_0598_0FD353E1424F7DE0">
the intere&s;t for the pre&s;ent, yet if it did not aboli&s;h the debt, the intere&s;t ran on, until means of payment &s;hould be provided&mdash;a debt does not the le&s;s bear intere&s;t, becau&s;e whether owing to its not being payable till a future day, or to the inability of the defendant, or any other cau&s;e, the creditor cannot pro|cure payment for the pre&s;ent, and is obliged to wait for both principal and intere&s;t, until &s;ome future day. The&s;e certificates bore intere&s;t, and the intere&s;t as well as the principal would form a &s;ett-off between the United States, and the &s;tate of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI></P>
<P>It has al&s;o been &s;aid Sir, that no part of the New-Loan debt was &s;ub&s;cribed under the fir&s;t Act of Con|gre&s;s, and as the la&s;t Act is, in this particular, but a continuation of the former one, it has been concluded, that the debt is not &s;ub&s;cribable under either. To this I an&s;wer, that under the fir&s;t Act, it was not the intere&s;t of any man to &s;ub&s;cribe the New-Loan debt, becau&s;e at <HI>that time,</HI> means of redeeming it at the Trea&s;ury of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> were not provided, and that therefore no one was &s;o &s;illy as to do an act from which he could de|rive no benefit; but that &s;uch means of redemption were afterwards provided, and therefore &s;uch &s;ub&s;crip|tions took place, when they were found to be beneficial. The conclu&s;ion, that the New-Loan debt, was not &s;ub|&s;cribable under the la&s;t Act of Congre&s;s, becau&s;e no part of it was &s;ub&s;cribed under the fir&s;t Act, is certain|ly then without foundation.</P>
<P>The honorable Senate have now Mr. Speaker, heard my rea&s;ons for thinking that "THE NEW-LOAN DEBT WAS SUBSCRIBABLE TO THE LOAN OF THE UNITED STATES," and I proceed to prove, what &s;eems to me to be a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence;&mdash;namely,</P>

<P>I have &s;aid, Sir, that <HI>"Penn&s;ylvania</HI> might redeem the&s;e debts, without the &s;malle&s;t inju&s;tice to her&s;elf, or any thing more than ju&s;tice to her creditors;" and &s;he her&s;elf &s;hall te&s;tify to the truth of this doctrine&mdash;The United States had done much for their creditors, but &s;uch were their arrangements, with re&s;pect to the &s;it <HI>per cent.</HI> the three <HI>per cent.</HI> and the deferred &s;tock, that they had not, at lea&s;t in the opinion of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> done ample ju&s;tice.&mdash;<HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> therefore by an Act of the 9th of April, 1791, after reciting; "That Con|gre&s;s had by their Act of the 4th of Augu&s;t, 1790. propo&s;ed a certain loan; that a compliance with it would greatly benefit this commonwealth, promote the plan of the general government, and facilitate the &s;et|tlement and liquidation of the accounts depen|ding be|tween <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> and the United States; and that in order to induce the creditors of this &s;tate to &s;ub&s;cribe to the &s;aid loan, and at the &s;ame time, to <HI>pre&s;erve the faith and honor of the commonwealth, by indemnifying them for the injury which they might &s;u&s;tain in con&s;equence of &s;uch &s;ub&s;cription,</HI> IT SHOULD BE ENACTED AND IT THEREBY WAS ENACTED, that "Every creditor of this State, who &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe to the &s;aid loan certificate whereon intere&s;t &s;hould be by law payable annually, at the trea|&s;ury of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> &s;hould, be&s;ides the &s;aid certi|ficate, which &s;uch creditor was thereupon entitled to have and receive from the United States, in pur&s;uance of the &s;aid recited Act, be entitled to have and receive from the commonwealth, certificates purporting that the &s;tate &s;tands pledge from the fir&s;t of January next, to pay &s;ix <HI>per cent.</HI> intere&s;t annually, on that part of the &s;ub&s;cribed debt, which is termed the deferred debt, until the United States &s;hould make provi&s;ion for the payment of the &s;aid intere&s;t, and al&s;o that the &s;tate &s;tands further pledged to pay an additional intere&s;t of three <HI>per cent.</HI> annually, from the 1&s;t of January next, on that part of the &s;ub&s;cribed debt, which bears an in|tere&s;t

The &s;uppo&s;ition therefore, that <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania</HI> did not mean to afford them the right of re|demption at her Trea&s;ury, carries with it a high charge of partiality and inju&s;tice with re&s;pect to her own citi|zens. If admitted, it would in fact amount to a de|claration on her part, that although the preten&s;ions and the rights of her creditors were alike, &s;he meant to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice to them by different weights, and un|equal mea&s;ures; and that while &s;he amply provided for a part of them, &s;he intended, that tho&s;e who &s;ub|&s;cribed to the &s;econd loan, <HI>under her own invitation</HI> &s;hould &s;u&s;tain a heavy lo&s;s.</P>

<P>Hence it follows, that on principles of equal ju&s;tice, there is every rea&s;on to conclude, that <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> re|ally intended by her Act of April, 1792, to render the New-Loan debts, &s;ub&s;cribed to the loan of the United States, redeemable at her Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>But the gentlemen exclaim again;&mdash;"Is it po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e, that <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> really intended, by her Act of April, 1792, to put her&s;elf intirely within the power of the United States, by providing for the re|demption of <HI>every &s;pecies of pretended debt,</HI> which they might think proper to a&s;&s;ume!&mdash;I an&s;wer, that nothing can be more certain, than that &s;he did not; and I freely admit, that if the New-Loan debt was not <HI>a real,</HI> but only a <HI>pretended one,</HI> I &s;hould be &s;o far from contend|ing that it it was redeemable, that I &s;hould have taken no trouble to prove its exi&s;tence, or that it was &s;ub|&s;cribable.</P>
<P>We are again told Sir, that the objects of redemption are enumerated in the 2d &s;ection of the Act of <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania</HI> of the 10th of April, 1792; and that, at the New-Loan debt is not among them, it is not within the provi&s;ions of that Act, nor redeemable.</P>
<P>If the premi&s;es were admitted to be true, the con|clu&s;ion might perhaps be incontrovertable, but if they are fal&s;e, it is certainly unwarranted. An examination of them is therefore nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>To me it appears, that THAT &s;ection of the Act of April, 1792, does not enumerate all the objects of re|demption.&mdash;I admit that it enumerates all the objects of immediate redemption from the particular funds &s;pecially provided by the early part of that Act; and I think that I may &s;afely make this admi&s;&s;ion, without weakening, or detracting from my opinion, that the
<PB N="595" REF="027132_0603_0FD353AD50084B38">
&s;ame Act makes eventual provi&s;ion for ca&s;es not enu|merated in the 2d &s;ection:&mdash;At the time of that Act being pa&s;&s;ed, the fir&s;t loan of the United States was clo&s;ed, and it could not po&s;&s;ibly be known whether it would or would not be opened again&mdash;<HI>eventual</HI> provi&s;ion might therefore be very proper, but, <HI>immediate</HI> and <HI>certain</HI> provi&s;ion for the redemption of the New-Loan debt, mu&s;t have been very improper at that time.</P>
<P><HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> then knew that &s;he had <HI>certain debts</HI> to provide for at <HI>all events,</HI> and the&s;e &s;he enumerated in the 2d &s;ection and took care to make &s;pecial and parti|cular provi&s;ion for;&mdash;but &s;he al&s;o knew, that &s;he owed certain other debts, which &s;he deemed it proper to pro|vide for the payment of, or not, as the United States &s;hould, or &s;hould not open or extend the loan&mdash;If they &s;hould not, &s;he did not think proper to provide for their redemption, but if they &s;hould, &s;he deemed it proper, and I think that, if we carefully attend to the 2d and 6th &s;ections, it will appear that the fir&s;t was in|tended to make <HI>certain</HI> and <HI>immediate</HI> provi&s;ion for the di&s;charge of certain debts; the latter to make <HI>eventual</HI> provi&s;ion for certain others, if the loan of the United States &s;hould be again opened&mdash;That the 2d &s;ection does not enumerate <HI>all</HI> the objects of redemption at all e|vents, is I think evident both from its letter and &s;pirit.</P>
<P>After providing, in part, an aggregate fund for the immediate di&s;charge of the enumerated debts, we find the preamble to the 2d &s;ection, to be worded as fol|lows&mdash;"And in order to provide effectually for the re|demption of CERTAIN public debts herein after &s;pecified, upon ju&s;t and rea&s;onable terms, "BE IT ENACTED," &amp;c. &mdash;The law then proceeds to encrea&s;e the funds and to direct the order in which <HI>certain</HI> debts &s;hall be di&s;charg|ed&mdash;Now, Sir, what is the meaning of the&s;e words, "In order to provide for the redemption of CERTAIN public debts?" Certainly not that <HI>all</HI> of them were to be pro|vided for by the &s;ection, which is introduced by the&s;e words, and the expre&s;&s;ion clearly &s;hews, that <HI>Penn&s;yl|vania</HI> acknowledge other ones, be&s;ides the CERTAIN
<PB N="596" REF="027132_0604_0FD353B3FAC8A908">
ones referred to in the preamble, and enumerated in the enacting clau&s;e. Had not this been the ca&s;e, the expre&s;&s;ion would have been, In order to provide for the redemption of THE public debts, in&s;tead of providing for <HI>certain</HI> of them&mdash;The expre&s;&s;ion; THE public debts, would have been the &s;ame with that of <HI>all</HI> of them, but the words CERTAIN of them have certainly a more confined meaning, and the u&s;ing of this language, &s;hews, that &s;he <HI>recogni&s;ed</HI> and acknowledged <HI>other</HI> ones be&s;ides tho&s;e enumerated in this &s;ection&mdash;But it is not pretended that &s;he owed any other debts than the enu|merated ones, except the <HI>New-Loan debt,</HI> and the <HI>debt</HI> due on the unfunded depreciation certificates. If then the expre&s;&s;ion u&s;ed in this law, &s;hews that <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> acknowledged <HI>other</HI> debts, than the enumerated ones, it al&s;o &s;hews, that &s;he acknowledged the New-Loan and unfunded Depreciation-Debts, to which, and to which only, they clearly implied, and &s;trongly marked ex|ception could relate. The truth is, that all the debts enumerated in the 2d &s;ection, were originally contract|ed by, and were due from her&s;elf&mdash;&s;he therefore by the fir&s;t and &s;econd &s;ection provided a fund for their <HI>immedi|ate</HI> di&s;charge, and by the 2d &s;ection, &s;he directs the or|der in which they &s;hall be di&s;charged out of it; and this nece&s;&s;arily lead to their enumeration&mdash;But as &s;he did not intend that the New-Loan and unfunded depre|ciation debts, &s;hould be paid out of this fund, &s;he could with no propriety enumerate them, as coming within this provi&s;ion, for immediate redemption.&mdash; The&s;e debts &s;he con&s;idered as not being originally and properly &s;peaking her own debts, but the debts of the United States, and &s;he therefore thought proper to let them re&s;t as they were, until the United States &s;hould extend or again open their loan, and that their redemp|tion at the Trea&s;ury of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> &s;hould depend on this event taking place or not. This will clearly ap|pear from the 6th &s;ection of the &s;ame law&mdash;"Be it e|nacted," &s;ays that &s;ection, "That if Congre&s;s &s;hall on or before the fir&s;t of July next, renew and again open

If <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> did not acknowledge other debts, be&s;ides the&s;e enumerated and provided for by the 1&s;t and 2d &s;ections; what u&s;e was there in in&s;erting this clau&s;e? <HI>none at all.</HI>&mdash;Its in&s;ertion however clearly &s;hews, that <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> did acknowledge other debts, be&s;ides the <HI>certain</HI> fir&s;t enumerated ones, and that &s;he intended to provide for their redemption, if the loan of the United States &s;hould be again opened&mdash;But &s;he owed no others, except the <HI>New-Loan and unfunded depreciati|on debts,</HI> and therefore, &s;he could not by this clau&s;e <HI>recogni&s;e</HI> or mean to provide for the <HI>redemption</HI> of any others but the&s;e.</P>
<P>It has been warmly contended, that "The &s;econd &s;ection is equally exten&s;ive with the &s;ixth, and that the latter does not embrace a &s;ingle object which is not in|cluded in the former." Can any thing more clearly &s;hew, the futility of this objection, than by con&s;idering that&punc; <HI>if it was true,</HI> there could be <HI>no occa&s;ion for the &s;ixth &s;ection;</HI> nor can it <HI>po&s;&s;ibly have any object in view;</HI> and by con&s;idering further, that the &s;econd &s;ection,

makes <HI>immediate</HI> and <HI>certain provi&s;ion,</HI> for the ca&s;es therein mentioned, and that the &s;ixth &s;ection only makes <HI>di&s;tant</HI> and <HI>conditional</HI> provi&s;ion, for the ca&s;es mentioned in it. <HI>Can therefore the ca&s;es be the &s;ame?</HI></P>

the meaning of the law is, but mu&s;t endeavour to pe|netrate into the hidden rece&s;&s;es of Mr. <HI>Gallatin's</HI> mind, and there grovel for it in the dark!</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of a provi&s;o, Sir, is to <HI>re&s;train</HI> and <HI>li|mit,</HI> that which has gone before, but there is not a &s;in|gle feature of this kind, in any part of the &s;ixth &s;ection. It is not the bu&s;ine&s;s, Sir, of a provi&s;o, to <HI>enlarge</HI> and <HI>extend,</HI> but the &s;ixth &s;ection is a new, independent clau&s;e, <HI>enlarging, extending</HI> and making <HI>further</HI> provi&s;ion, with|out a &s;ingle condition, or re&s;triction, on any thing which had been before enacted&mdash;If intended as a provi&s;o, upon the &s;econd &s;ection; and if intended to relate to the objects contained in it, and to no others, proper terms of reference would have been made u&s;e of, to connect them together, and to &s;hew the dependance of one upon the other&mdash;The language of the &s;ixth &s;ection would not have been that the "Holders of any cer|tificates" &s;hall, &amp;c. but it would have been the hold|ers of the <HI>&s;aid</HI> certificates; or of the <HI>afore&s;aid</HI> certifi|cates; or the certificates <HI>herein before mentioned,</HI> or &s;ome expre&s;&s;ion of the like import and meaning, would have been made u&s;e of, &s;o as to confine the provi&s;ions of the &s;ixth &s;ection, to the ca&s;es mentioned in the &s;econd.</P>
<P>Nor is it po&s;&s;ible, Sir, for that to be a provi&s;o, which <HI>is more exten&s;ive than the enacting clau&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Al&s;o that the &s;ixth &s;ection has never been con&s;idered as a provi&s;o upon the 2d &s;ection, nor confined to the ca&s;es mentioned in it, is clear from what I am now about to &s;ay&mdash;It is admitted that the unfunded depreciation cer|tificates, are not included in the &s;econd &s;ection, and that <HI>that</HI> &s;ection makes no provi&s;ion for their redemption at the Trea&s;ury of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and yet it is in proof, that it has been the con&s;tant practice, for them to be <HI>&s;o redeemed</HI> under the &s;ixth &s;ection.</P>
<P>Among others who have under&s;tood the law as I do, and who&s;e old unfunded depreciation certificates, were redeemed in this way, were Mr. <HI>Rittenhou&s;e:</HI> The late Mr. <HI>Powell,</HI> Speaker of the Senate, at the time when the redemption law of April, 1792, was pa&s;|&s;ed;

and Judge <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> and Judge <HI>Yeates,</HI> who were very competent to the true interpretation of the law;&mdash; The Regi&s;ter-General certified the payment to be due; the Governor drew his warrants for payment, and pay|ments were actually made by the State Trea&s;urer&mdash;Why then is criminality imputed to the Comptroller-General and to <HI>him only?</HI> and why do not the&s;e mighty aven|gers of the law, direct its &s;word again&s;t all the&s;e other officers of government!</P>
<P>They perhaps have not the misfortune to <HI>have fallen under the di&s;plea&s;ure of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives!</HI></P>
<P>But further Sir; it is in evidence, that Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> him&s;elf, in a conver&s;ation with Mr. <HI>Donnald&s;on</HI> expre&s;&s;ed his opinion, in clear and pointed terms, that the old unfunded depreciation certificates, were, under the 6th &s;ection, <HI>redeemable at the Trea&s;ury</HI> of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI>&mdash; He therefore, at lea&s;t at that time, thought the 6th &s;ec|tion was <HI>more exten&s;ive</HI> than the 2d; that the one was <HI>not a provi&s;o</HI> on the other; and that <HI>other</HI> ca&s;es than tho&s;e mentioned in the 2d &s;ection were intended to be provided for by the 6th.</P>
<P>But &s;ay the gentlemen, is it po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e, that the State meant to &s;acrifice her three <HI>per cent.</HI> &s;tock, in order to redeem the New-Loan debt, which was pro|perly the debt of the United States?</P>
<P>Whether &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition is po&s;&s;ible or not, I do not think worth con&s;idering, &s;ince we have made no &s;uch &s;uppo&s;ition, nor is it at all nece&s;&s;ary to our con&s;truction &mdash;The 2d &s;ection directs the &s;ale of the three <HI>per cent.</HI> &s;tock, for the redemption of the debts enumerated in that &s;ection, and we admit, that the New-Loan debt is not enumerated in it, nor entitled to redemption out of the fund which it provides.</P>
<P>We have been told Sir, by the learned coun&s;el, "That if the 6th &s;ection is not to be taken as a provi&s;o to the 2d one, or if it is interpreted to extend to a &s;ingle new object, it mu&s;t extend <HI>to all the debts, due from all the &s;tates in the Union, to their own citizens!</HI> and that a|greeably

to our con&s;truction, Penn&s;ylvania <HI>has provided for their redemption at her own Trea&s;ury!"</HI></P>
<P>This is to be &s;ure a fine flight in the regions of fan|cy and imagination, and &s;uppo&s;ing it to have been &s;o intended. I &s;hall re&s;t &s;atisfied with gazing with admira|tion and wonder at the plea&s;ing phantom!</P>
<P>I have done with this point Mr. Speaker, and &s;hall proceed to the</P>
<P>Second po&s;ition;&mdash;Namely, THAT THERE WAS AN AP|PROPRIATION MADE BY LAW, FOR THE REDEMPTION OF THE NEW-LOAN CERTIFICATES, AT THE TREASURY OF PENNSYLVANIA.</P>
<P>The Con&s;titution of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> provides, that "NO MONEY SHALL BE DRAWN FROM THE TREASURY, BUT IN CONSEQUENCE OF APPROPRIATIONS MADE BY LAW." and one of the articles charges, that the defendant "with a view to his own emolument, did under colour of his office, certify to the Governor, that certain debts, including the &s;aid certificates, but not naming or de|&s;cribing the &s;ame, were redeemable and payable when, <HI>no fund was by law provided for paying the &s;ame."</HI>&mdash; This charge is certainly a pretty high one, but if it &s;hall appear, as I tru&s;t it will, to be without foundati|on, it mu&s;t fall.</P>
<P>The Act of March the 1&s;t, 1786, created the New-Loan debt and funded it as to part.</P>
<P>The Act of the 27th of March, 1789, unfunded it altogether.</P>
<P>An Act of the 7th of April, 1791, for "appropri|ating certain funds and revenues for the &s;upport of go|vernment, and the payment of the public debts," after making certain &s;pecific appropriations, provides by the 12th appropriation, that the re&s;idue of the aggregate fund therein mentioned, &s;hall be applied "to pay all warrants thereafter to to be drawn for <HI>claims</HI> and im|provements, by virtue of <HI>any law or laws of this com|monwealth."</HI></P>
<P>And the 6th &s;ection of the Act of the 10th of April 1792, provides that "The holder or holders of any
<PB N="602" REF="027132_0610_0FD3543D5079C9E8">
certificate or certificates, &s;ub&s;cribable to the loan of the United States, if it &s;hould be again opened, &s;hall be entitled to have and receive the nominal value of the &s;aid certificate or certificates, <HI>from the State-Trea&s;urer,</HI> upon &s;ub&s;cribing to the &s;aid loan, and trans|fering to the State-Trea&s;urer, for the u&s;e of the com|monwealth, the certificates which they &s;hould receive from the United States, in con&s;equence of &s;uch &s;ub|&s;cription."</P>
<P>The certificates certified to the Governor by Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> in the manner already mentioned, were the New-Loan certificates; they had been &s;ub&s;cribed to the loan of the United States; &s;uch transfer as is in this Act mentioned had been made, and if I have prov|ed, that they were &s;ub&s;cribable to the loan of the U|nited States, and redeemable at the Trea&s;ury of <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania,</HI> I think hardly any thing can be more clear than that, <HI>"an appropriation was made by law for that purpo&s;e."</HI></P>
<P>It has been objected, Sir, "That Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> certi|fied the&s;e debts to be payable <HI>out of the funds</HI> provided by the Act of the 10th of April, 1792; that he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> been guilty of prevarication: has been &s;hifting his ground; flying backwards and forwards; uncertain what to fix upon, &s;o as to &s;ave him&s;elf; that he began with the Act of 1792, and finding <HI>that</HI> &s;ource to fail him, he was reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of employing <HI>in|genious</HI> coun&s;el, more <HI>ingenious</HI> than him&s;elf, to find funds, which he never thought of; that he concludes with &s;aying, that an appropriation was made by the law of April, 1791;" and our opponents conclude with &s;aying, "That even if an appropriation was made by this Act, Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> is neverthele&s;s guilty," becau&s;e &s;ay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they "he neither knew or dreamed of an appropria|tion having been made for this purpo&s;e, by the Act of April, 1791, at the time of his certifying to the Go|vernor."</P>
<P>The fir&s;t an&s;wer which I &s;hall give to the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions is, that <HI>no one of them is t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ue;</HI> and the next; that if

<P>The 12th appropriation of the Act of April, 1791, is for "The payment of all warrants thereafter to be drawn for <HI>claims</HI> and improvements, by virtue of <HI>any law or laws</HI> of this commonwealth," and the Act of April, 1792, declares that the holders of certificates, who &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe to the loan of the United States, and make a transfer to <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> &s;hould be entitled to payment at the Trea&s;ury of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> The Act of April, 1791 therefore contained an appropriation for all <HI>claims</HI> again&s;t the commonwealth, and the Act of April, 1792 directed payment to be made&mdash;It was therefore <HI>by</HI> the Act of April, 1792, that payment was to be made, out of an appropriation made by the Act of April, 1791.&mdash;Payment could not be made by the Act of 1791, becau&s;e the Act of 1789 had prevented payment, and therefore, until the Act of 1792 directed payment to be made at the Trea&s;ury of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> payment could, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot be made at all&mdash;Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> in all his certificates to the Governor certified "payable <HI>per</HI> Act of April, 1792," (Here Mr. <HI>Lewis</HI> called for the warrant book and &s;hewed that Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> had certified in the manner which he now &s;tated) and I &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t I hope to be called upon to prove, that if the debt was "payable <HI>per</HI> Act of 1792," it was payable <HI>by</HI> the Act of 1792, though that payment was to be made out of funds provided by an appropriation contained in the Act of April, 1791&mdash;Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s ground was originally taken by Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">proved by every certifi|cate which has <HI>been</HI> produc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> from this ground he has never departed, nor has he varied in the &s;malle&s;t degree &mdash;In&s;tead of his <HI>ingenious</HI> coun&s;el finding out this ground for him, he pointed it out to them, and had the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives; the managers or the oppo&s;ite coun|&s;el, under&s;tood the &s;ubject as well as Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> did, all the&s;e &s;evere ob&s;ervations might have been &s;pared.&mdash; There is not a &s;ingle word in a &s;ingle in&s;tance, of all
<PB N="604" REF="027132_0612_0FD353C3E9F754F8">
the ca&s;es certified to the Governor by Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> which has the &s;malle&s;t &s;emblance to what has been im|puted to him, nor which warrants in the &s;malle&s;t de|gree, any one of the a&s;&s;ertions on which I at pre&s;ent animadvert.</P>
<P>That the New-Loan debt was payable by the Act of April 1792, and not by the Act of April 1791, will clearly appear when we con&s;ider, that after the pa&s;&s;ing of the fir&s;t, and until the pa&s;&s;ing of the la&s;t, it was <HI>not payable at all.</HI> It was a claim again&s;t the common|wealth it is true, but as payment of that claim had been &s;topped by a former law, it could not take place, until it was directed by a &s;ub&s;equent law. This was directed by the Act of April 1792, and not before, and of cour&s;e it was by this Act and by no other that it was payable.</P>
<P>Here, Sir, it is material to recollect, that in every in&s;tance of the old Unfunded Depreciation certificates, Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> certified to the Governor in <HI>the &s;ame words</HI> as he has done with re&s;pect to the New-Loan debt; that the Regi&s;ter-General joined with him in certifying in like manner; that warrants were there|upon i&s;&s;ued by the Governor, and payments were made by the Trea&s;urer, to <HI>able law judges,</HI> without any per|&s;on &s;uppo&s;ing it to be wrong, until the di&s;covery was made by the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives. The que&s;tion as to an appropriation having been made by law, or not, was preci&s;ely the &s;ame in both ca&s;es, and what was right in one of them, cannot be wrong in the other.</P>
<P>But we are told "That the Act of the 26th of March 1789, &s;et apart only &pound;. 10,000 annually for <HI>claims</HI> and improvements, and as <HI>that</HI> &s;um was too &s;mall to &s;atisfy the New-Loan debt, the fund could not be intended for that purpo&s;e." This I admit to be true, and I have no objection to furni&s;hing our opponents with a much &s;tronger rea&s;on in &s;upport of their argument. <HI>That</HI> law was pa&s;&s;ed the very day next preceding the pa&s;&s;ing of the law which &s;topped payment of the New-Loan debt, and while the bill for that purpo&s;e was before the
<PB N="605" REF="027132_0613_0FD353AEBB029528">
Hou&s;e, &s;o that payment could hot have been then in|tended <HI>out of any funds.</HI></P>
<P>This does not however operate again&s;t us, &s;ince in&s;ufficient to this purpo&s;e, the annual &s;um of &pound;. 10,000 may have been in March 1789, when <HI>all the New-Loan certificates were in circulation,</HI> the re&s;idue of the aggregate fund &s;et apart for claims and improve|ments by the Act of April 1791, was abundantly more than &s;ufficient. At this time there were but <HI>few</HI> of the New-Loan certificates in circulation, and the &s;um &s;et apart by the 12th appropriation for claims and im|provements, was &s;o great, as, among many other things, to furni&s;h the <HI>whole of the State &s;ub&s;cription to the</HI> Penn&s;ylvania <HI>bank.</HI></P>
<P>It is further objected, "That the law of April 1791, did not contemplate the payment of the New-Loan debt, &s;ince in none of the enumerated appropriations is that debt mentioned." This may perhaps be true, &s;ince I can hardly &s;uppo&s;e, that the Legi&s;lature of 1791, could contemplate providing for the payment of a debt, which was not at that time payable at all, nor until more than one year after, and this &s;ufficiently ac|counts for there being no &s;pecial appropriation for that purpo&s;e. There is not however a &s;hadow of pretence for the objection, &s;ince the clau&s;e &s;pecially appropriates all the re&s;idue of the aggregate fund "To pay all warrants hereafter to be drawn for claims and improve|ments by virtue of any law or laws of this common|wealth"&mdash;This &s;urely &s;upercedes the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;pe|cial appropriation upon every occa&s;ion, for claims then due and payable, but not otherwi&s;e provided for, or which &s;hould be made due and payable by &s;ub&s;equent laws. The Con&s;titution does not require a &s;pecial ap|propriation on every particular occa&s;ion, mentioning the object and the fund at the &s;ame time: or if it does, the whole of the 12th appropriation is uncon&s;titutional, ina&s;much as it mentions no particular object to be provided for, but creates a fund for the payment of all warrants i&s;&s;ued under any law for claims and improve|ments&mdash;In
<PB N="606" REF="027132_0614_0FD3543ECF862EA0">
1791 <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> owed certain debts, and the Legi&s;lature provided for their payment, and enu|merated certain funds for that purpo&s;e; but &s;he al&s;o owed many others, of various de&s;criptions, and &s;he knew that &s;he would, under her future laws, be liable for their payments&mdash;She therefore by the 12th appropria|tion, provided a fund "To pay all warrants to be drawn for claims and improvements by virtue of any law or laws." What the then exi&s;ting claims were, &s;he did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to determine; what claims might be due under any future law or laws, &s;he left to the con&s;idera|tion of future Legi&s;latures, but &s;he provided and ap|propriated a fund for the di&s;charge of all &s;uch claims as were then payable or &s;hould be made &s;o; "By virtue of any law or laws of this commonwealth.&mdash; By a law of March, 1786, the New-Loan debt was created; by a law of the 10th of April, 1792, it was made payable, and of cour&s;e it was payable out of a fund provided "to pay all warrants drawn for claims by virtue of any law of this commonwealth."&mdash;Unle&s;s therefore the Act of the 10th of April, 1792, is <HI>not a law of this commonwealth;</HI> the law of the 7th of A|pril, 1791, provides and appropriates a fund, for what|ever is payable under that of April, 1792.&mdash;The con|&s;titution only requires, that there &s;hould be an ap|propriation; but there may be one appropriation, for ten thou&s;and purpo&s;es;&mdash;as well for the future, as the pre&s;ent, and it may be left to future Legi&s;latures to &s;ay, what debts &s;hall be contracted or made payable, but when they are contracted and made payable, it will be from this <HI>previous appropriation,</HI> without an ad|ditional one being made. If any thing need be added on this &s;ubject, permit me to remark, that if a &s;ufficient appropriation has not been made in the manner alrea|dy contended for, I am at a lo&s;s for language which can be more clear or expre&s;&s;ive of an appropriation, than that to which I have endeavoured to draw the attention of the honourable Senate.&mdash;A fund, &s;ays the law of A|pril, 1791, "To pay <HI>all warrants hereafter to be drawn

for claims or improvements by virtue of any law or laws of this commonwealth!"</HI> By virtue of a law of the 10th of April, 1792, the claims of the holders of the New-Loan certificates were, as we &s;ay, entitled to be paid &mdash;could I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, that any Legi&s;lature after A|pril, 1791, had thought that the Legi&s;lature of that time, had made u&s;e of language not &s;ufficiently ex|pre&s;&s;ive of an appropriation, and to have wi&s;hed to make u&s;e of language more clear, pointed and expre&s;|&s;ive than this; "To <HI>pay all warrants hereafter to be drawn for claims and improvements, by virtue of any law or laws of this commonwealth;"</HI>&mdash;I a&s;k what expre&s;|&s;ion more clear;&mdash;what terms more per&s;picuous; what language more &s;trong and expre&s;&s;ive of an appropriati|on could po&s;&s;ibly have been u&s;ed!&mdash;If our language affords them, I have no conception of it, nor can I per|ceive how an appropriation could by any &s;ub&s;equent law have been made, if it was not already done.</P>
<P>I have admitted, Sir, that the Legi&s;lature of April, 1791, may not have contemplated the New-Loan debt, but if this proves any thing, it proves what has not, and I am &s;ure will not be contended;&mdash;namely, that nothing made payable by any law, &s;ub&s;equent to that time, and not then in the contemplation of the Legi&s;|lature, was payable out of the 12th appropriation: The que&s;tion is not, whether it was in the contempla|tion of the Legi&s;lature of April, 1791; but of the Legi&s;lature of April, 1792. What adds con&s;iderable weight to the idea that the Legi&s;lature of April, 1791, intended the 12th appropriation as a fund for the pay|ment of all the un-enumerated debts of the common|wealth, whether funded or not, &s;o &s;oon as the latter &s;hould be by law made payable, is a report of the com|mittee of ways and means, on the 8th of February, 1791, adopted by the very Hou&s;e which pa&s;&s;ed the law of April, 1791.

A que&s;tion therefore aro&s;e in their delibera|tions, whether the State ought to &s;ubmit to the incon|veniences and mortifications of an emberra&s;&s;ed Trea|&s;ury, and <HI>depreciated name,</HI> or re&s;ort to her general cre|dit, and the &s;ecurity claims which &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es again&s;t the Union for the nece&s;&s;ary relief from her dif|ficulties. The <HI>nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;toring public credit;</HI> the ju&s;tice due to the creditors of the State, and a full con|viction of the di&s;grace in which a free nation involves her&s;elf, that either directly or indirectly forfeits her en|gagements, were con&s;iderations too obvious and too forcible to permit your committee to he&s;itate in their deci&s;ion." "The large amount of public &s;ecurities of the United States, which are the property of the State, obliged your committee to take into con&s;ideration, the terms of the loan propo&s;ed by Congre&s;s to the dome&s;|tic creditors, in the Act, "entitled an Act making provi&s;ion for the debt of the United States." And al|though, <HI>in their opinion tho&s;e terms are not commen&s;urate with the ju&s;t claims of tho&s;e creditors,</HI> yet, unwilling to embarra&s;s the mea&s;ures of the Federal Legi&s;lature, they recommend an acquie&s;cence to the terms offered by Congre&s;s in the Act afore&s;aid. Upon the&s;e grounds, therefore, the committee beg leave to offer the follow|ing re&s;olutions to the Legi&s;lature, for their con&s;idera|tion and approbation, with this prefatory remark, that con&s;idering the great inconveniences which have hither|to

<P>This report, Sir, having been adopted by the Le|gi&s;lature, is not only indicative of its &s;entiments, but is expre&s;&s;ed in its own words and language.&mdash;I read it for &s;everal purpo&s;es. The &s;hameful imputation has been made again&s;t <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> that &s;he only meant to free her&s;elf from her embarra&s;&s;ments; and as &s;he was not embarra&s;&s;ed by her unfunded debt, &s;he did not mean to provide a fund or make an appropriation for its di&s;charge.&mdash;If the an&s;wers already given to this objec|tion, are not &s;ufficient, I hope that they are afforded by this report&mdash;It was adopted in February 1791 by the <HI>&s;ome Legi&s;lature,</HI> which in April 1791, created and &s;et apart the fund out of which we &s;ay the New-Loan debt is, under the law of April 1792, payable, and it is therefore worthy of peculiar attention. In it we find nothing in &s;upport of the a&s;&s;ertion, that <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> only intended to free her&s;elf from her embarra&s;&s;ments, by providing for the di&s;charge of her funded debts&mdash;on the contrary we find her &s;aying, that "The embarra&s;&s;|ments of her finances, chiefly aro&s;e from her large un|funded debt, the whole amount whereof was an actual demand again&s;t the Trea&s;ury." What was this large unfunded debt? Nothing that I know of, except the <HI>New-Loan Debt,</HI> and the debt due upon the old Un|funded Depreciation certificates. Is not this therefore a full acknowledgment of the New-Loan debt? But how it may be a&s;ked could &s;he be embarra&s;&s;ed by it? <HI>In promptu e&s;t re&s;pon&s;io;</HI> and that an&s;wer is, that as in|tere&s;t was accumulating and pay-day mu&s;t come, &s;he felt her&s;elf as much embarra&s;&s;ed by the pro&s;pect of fu|ture evils as by the exi&s;tence of pre&s;ent ones.</P>
<P>Again, Sir;&mdash;&s;he felt an embarra&s;&s;ment from her faith being pro&s;trated and her honour tainted, and from this
<PB N="610" REF="027132_0618_0FD35416A2CB45B8">
embarra&s;&s;ment &s;he wi&s;hed to be freed. That I may avoid repetition I will not again read any part of the report, nor be guilty of u&s;ele&s;s quotations from it, but &s;hall re&s;t &s;atisfied with a&s;king, if its great; nay, its principal object does not appear to be, to re&s;tore public faith, by making either immediate or eventual pro|vi&s;ion for the di&s;charge of the unfunded debt? If this que&s;tion is an&s;wered in the affirmative, how futile mu&s;t the objection be, that &s;he only wi&s;hed to free her&s;elf from her embarra&s;&s;ments by providing for the funded ones! That &s;he did not make immediate and certain provi&s;ion for its payment is true, becau&s;e &s;he did not know whether the loan of the United States, on which that provi&s;ion was to depend, would or would not be again opened. But &s;he neverthele&s;s <HI>provided a fund and made an appropriation</HI> for the payment, if it &s;hould be opened, and the Act of April 1792 fixed the pay|ment upon that fund and appropriation, upon the terms and conditions contained in the la&s;t mentioned Act.</P>
<P>The adoption of this report proves,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. An acknowledgment of the exi&s;tence of the New-Loan debt.</P>
<P N="2">2d. The obligation and the will of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> to di&s;charge it, if a future Legi&s;lature &s;hould &s;o direct under a loan of the United States; and,</P>
<P N="3">3d. That the 12th appropriation of the Act of April 1791 was intended to an&s;wer <HI>all claims</HI> again&s;t the com|monwealth, not particularly provided for, which were or &s;hould be by law payable. I &s;ay to an&s;wer <HI>all claims,</HI> except as I have already excepted, for in the report are the&s;e remarkable words&mdash;"To form all the reve|nues of the State into one aggregate fund, <HI>charged with all the public debts and engagements."</HI> This report was as has been already ob&s;erved, adopted by the &s;ame Hou&s;e, which very &s;oon after, pa&s;&s;ed the law of April 1791, and if it is not clearly expre&s;&s;ive of the will of that Hou&s;e, that the 12th appropriation &s;hould be for the di&s;charge of <HI>"all the public debts and engagements
<PB N="611" REF="027132_0619_0FD35444042F22F0">
of the commonwealth,"</HI> I am really at a lo&s;s to know in what words that will could be expre&s;&s;ed!!!</P>
<P>But, Sir, the mo&s;t important part of this report re|mains to be mentioned&mdash;It offered, for the adoption of the Hou&s;e, a re&s;olution <HI>which was adopted by the Hou&s;e</HI> in the following words, to wit: That the re&s;idue of the aggregate fund &s;hould be appropriated to the pay|ment and di&s;charge of "THE ARREARAGES OF INTEREST NOW DUE ON THE NEW-LOAN CERTIFICATES."</P>
<P>This re&s;olution was pa&s;&s;ed before the tran&s;actions took place which are imputed to Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> as cri|minal.</P>
<P>It was pa&s;&s;ed by the &s;ame Hou&s;e, which pa&s;&s;ed the law of April 179<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, making the 12th appropriation, out of which we &s;ay the New-Loan debt was by the law of April 1792 made payable.</P>
<P>It &s;hews that <HI>that</HI> Hou&s;e was &s;o far from being of the opinion, that the New-Loan debt had been abo|li&s;hed by the Act of March 1789, that it not only ac|knowledged its exi&s;tence, but thought that the intere&s;t due upon it, &s;hould be paid independent of the loan of the United States.</P>
<P>It &s;hews that the 12th appropriation was intended for this purpo&s;e, and although the law pa&s;&s;ed &s;oon after by the &s;ame Hou&s;e, left the &s;ame appropriation to &s;atisfy <HI>all claims</HI> which future Legi&s;latures &s;hould make pay|able.</P>
<P>After all this, can it be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any thing more to prove, that when by the Act of April 1792, the New-Loan debt was made payable, the Act of April 1791 contained an appropriation for that pur|po&s;e?</P>
<P>Yes! &s;ay the gentlemen; for that the words "To &s;atis|fy all <HI>claims"</HI> are not de&s;criptive of the New-Loan certificates, &s;ince they formed no <HI>claim</HI> again&s;t the com|monwealth; but were only receipts for the return of the certificates at the plea&s;ure of the commonwealth." With what dexterity do the gentlemen &s;hift their ground? In order to get rid of one difficulty, they
<PB N="612" REF="027132_0620_0FD353CADF2E2D80">
warmly contended, that the New-Loan certificates did not create a <HI>debt,</HI> but only a <HI>claim</HI> again&s;t the State. Lord <HI>Coke</HI> was our authority that the word <HI>claim</HI> in|cludes <HI>debts</HI> and is of more exten&s;ive meaning than the word <HI>debt.</HI> They now abandon their former ground, and &s;ay that the New-Loan certificates were only in nature of <HI>receipts</HI> for the old Continental ones, but that they <HI>did not amount to a claim again&s;t the State.</HI> They are driven to this &s;ubterfuge, by our &s;hewing, that the re|&s;idue of the 12th appropriation is for the payment of all un-enumerated <HI>claims</HI> again&s;t the commonwealth; and they can find no way of getting rid of this diffi|culty, but by contending, that <HI>that</HI> which they had before &s;aid <HI>was a claim</HI> again&s;t the commonwealth, is <HI>not a claim</HI> again&s;t the commonwealth!</P>
<P>It may therefore I think be fairly concluded, that there is not a &s;hadow of ground for this charge, of <HI>a violation of the Con&s;titution;</HI> and that if the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives had under&s;tood the law but half as well as Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> did, they would hardly have commit|ted them&s;elves by making it. If <HI>they</HI> were impeached for this part of their conduct, there is perhaps <HI>one ground</HI> on which they might be acquitted.&mdash;I will proceed, Sir, to my</P>
<P>Third and la&s;t po&s;ition; namely&mdash;THAT NO CRI|MINAL OFFENCE IS SUFFICIENTLY CHARGED AND PROV|ED AGAINST MR. NICHOLSON.</P>
<P>I &s;ay <HI>charged and proved,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>neither</HI> is material if the other is <HI>in&s;ufficient,</HI> and they mu&s;t <HI>both</HI> come home to the de|fendant in his <HI>official conduct,</HI> or the pro&s;ecution mu&s;t fail. The evidence mu&s;t &s;upport what is &s;ufficiently charged, and it will not be &s;ufficient for it to &s;upport any other matter. I need not take much trouble to prove, that there is no ground for the impeachment, unle&s;s an of|fence has been committed by Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> in his offi|cial capacity. <HI>"The Governor,"</HI> &s;ays the Con&s;titution, <HI>"and all other civil officers under this commonwealth, &s;hall be liable to impeachment for any mi&s;demeanor in office."</HI></P>
<P><PB N="613" REF="027132_0621_0FD3541B553FE548">This &s;urely excludes all ideas of an impeachment, for what was done in any other capacity. If this is at|tended to, many of the charges mu&s;t vani&s;h, and unle&s;s his certificates are &s;tated and proved to have been given under colour of his office, and of matters relating to his official duty he mu&s;t be acquitted.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t article charges that the defendant "Did under <HI>colour of his office recogni&s;e certify and declare, the &s;aid certificates, commonly called New-Loan certificates, to be &s;ub&s;cribable, as debts due and owing by the State of</HI> Penn&s;ylvania," to the loan of the United States.</P>
<P><HI>Did under colour of his office.</HI> It is &s;urely not &s;uffici|ent to &s;tate that he did it under colour of his office, without al&s;o &s;tating, that it belonged to his office to certify one way or the other, or at lea&s;t &s;hewing it, by &s;ome public law, of which the Senate can take notice. But the truth is, the certifying in the manner he did, had no connection whatever with the duties of his of|fice and it will pre&s;ently appear, that neither he nor any body el&s;e, ever &s;uppo&s;ed that it had&mdash;It is not &s;tated to have been any part of his official duties to certify at all, and unle&s;s the managers can &s;hew that it was con|nected with his official duties, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Senate mu&s;t, with|out re&s;orting to evidence, know that the pro&s;ecution is without foundation.</P>
<P>Was there any law of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> which impo&s;ed this upon him as a duty? It will not be pretended. Was there any law of the United States which required it of him? No &s;uch laws can be &s;hewn, and if there could, and he had abu&s;ed his tru&s;t, he would be amean|able in a tribunal of the United States; but not in the tribunal of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI></P>
<P>If this is the ca&s;e &s;ay the gentlemen, here is a bold and daring u&s;urpation of power, and of cour&s;e the de|fendant is doubly guilty! It &s;eems to be their determi|nation I think, that whether he is guilty or not, he &s;hall if po&s;&s;ible be convicted, but it is rather too much to expect that he is to be convicted without a charge. If he is guilty of u&s;urping power, why is he not im|peached
<PB N="614" REF="027132_0622_0FD3541C5516F8B8">
for it? or if this di&s;covery was neither known nor thought of before, why do not his honorable accu|&s;ers retire to their own room and vote an additional article again&s;t him?&mdash;They might do it in <HI>a few minutes</HI> on the <HI>information</HI> of &s;ome one of the managers, and without wa&s;ting time in <HI>&s;wearing</HI> the witne&s;&s;es, or even in <HI>examining</HI> them&mdash;would not this be better than to condemn a man without a previous accu&s;ation. It is better that there &s;hould be an accu&s;ation, though made in the mo&s;t irregular manner, than a condemnation without a charge.</P>
<P>But if I admit for a moment that the defendant had certified in the manner alledged again&s;t him, that the New-Loan certificates were <HI>&s;ub&s;cribable</HI> to the loan of the United States, what has <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> to do with this or how could &s;he be thereby injured? we are told that they were not redeemable at the Trea&s;ury of <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania.</HI> If this is the ca&s;e, and if the United States tru&s;ting, which it is in proof that they did not, to Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI>'s certificate, admitted of &s;ub&s;criptions not by law admi&s;&s;ible, the United States might be injured though <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> could not&mdash;The pro&s;ecutors mu&s;t therefore admit of the redeemability, or give up this charge&mdash;If the certificates were redeemable they mu&s;t of cour&s;e have been &s;ub&s;cribable, becau&s;e no certifi|cates were redeemable that were not &s;ub&s;cribable. I be|lieve the accu&s;ers will find &s;ome difficulty in extricating them&s;elves from this dilemma.</P>
<P>The crime imputed to the defendant by this article is, that of <HI>recogni&s;ing, certifying and declaring</HI> the &s;aid certificates to be redeemable&mdash;To <HI>recogni&s;e,</HI> is to <HI>ac|knowledge,</HI> but what offence is it again&s;t law, for a man to <HI>acknowledge</HI> any thing? But &s;uppo&s;e it to be an of|fence, for Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> to <HI>recogni&s;e, certify</HI> and <HI>declare</HI> this to &s;ome <HI>proper officer,</HI> yet to con&s;titute the offence, the impeachment mu&s;t &s;tate this to have been done to that officer; but it is not charged that he did it to any body, and of cour&s;e no criminal charge is made again&s;t him by the fir&s;t article&mdash;But if there is, yet there is no
<PB N="615" REF="027132_0623_0FD3282285EC6738">
evidence in &s;upport of it&mdash;The committee of impeach|ments knew, or might have known, that Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> did not certify in his <HI>official</HI> capacity;&mdash;they al&s;o knew, or they might have known, that he did not certify to <HI>any officer</HI> whatever, that the &s;aid certificates were &s;ub&s;cribable&mdash;If they did know the&s;e things, it is really too bad, to charge it to have been done <HI>under co|lour of his office;</HI> and if they did not know the&s;e things, they were guilty of a culpable neglect of duty, when the means of information were at hand by enquiring of Mr. <HI>Smith.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e, Sir, are not objections to mere form, but they go to the very e&s;&s;ence of the fir&s;t article. If they are &s;olid, that article is in&s;ufficient, and no weight of evidence could authori&s;e a conviction;&mdash;or if it could, it will be found, that the evidence brought to &s;upport it, cannot po&s;&s;ibly affect the defendant.</P>
<P>It appears in evidence, to be an <HI>uniform practice</HI> with Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> to authenticate his <HI>official</HI> acts, by &s;ub|&s;cribing his name at length, where he tran&s;acted bu&s;ine&s;s with any other officers. It appears that in all the ca&s;es which this article &s;tates to have been done by him, <HI>un|der colour of his office,</HI> he did no more than write on the back of the New-Loan certificates, the&s;e words <HI>"Ge|nuine</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;umable,"</HI> with the initial letters of his name &s;ub&s;cribed, and without adding the words "Comptrol|ler-General's office." This &s;ufficiently &s;hews, that he did not con&s;ider the&s;e acts as being <HI>official,</HI> and it will next appear, that no body el&s;e con&s;idered them &s;o.</P>
<P>But why, it is a&s;ked, did Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> certify at all, if it was not in his official capacity, and intended as an authentic document in the proper offices, to &s;hew that the New-Loan certificates were &s;ub&s;cribable to the loan of the United States? The gentlemen who have a&s;ked the que&s;tion, have heard the evidence of young Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> and cannot I am &s;ure be at any lo&s;s for the proper an&s;wer. This young gentleman is the &s;on of the late Commi&s;&s;ioner of Loans, and his evidence is &s;o clear and &s;atisfactory, that if all prejudices, either in
<PB N="616" REF="027132_0624_0FD353EA0FA76688">
favour of or again&s;t Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> are laid a&s;ide, as I tru&s;t they are, it will appear, that the evidence adduc|ed, if any there is, again&s;t Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> under this charge, is no le&s;s in&s;ufficient, than the charge it&s;elf. He &s;wears, that "it was thought for the benefit and &s;afety of individuals, that, they &s;hould fir&s;t apply to Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> for their certificates, le&s;t they might be locked up until the end of the loan in 1793, when the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury was to decide, and if any &s;hould be rejected, as not being &s;ub&s;cribable, the hold|ers might have lain out of the intere&s;t in the mean time; and for this rea&s;on if they brought their certificates to the Commi&s;&s;ioner, without being fir&s;t &s;hewn to Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> they were &s;ent to him for examination, al|though his certification was of no con&s;equence to the Commi&s;&s;ioner; the receipts given by him for the cer|tificates being purpo&s;ely &s;o worded, as that the vouch|ers in the State offices might be examined at the end of the loan, and that from them he might learn whether the certificates were <HI>genuine</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;umable</HI> or not;"&mdash; but he expre&s;sly declares, "That <HI>his father took no no|tice of Mr.</HI> Nichol&s;on<HI>'s certification, as to what re&s;pect|ed him&s;elf."</HI>&mdash;We have here, Sir, a full and complete &s;tatement of this <HI>"certifying, recogni&s;ing and declaring"</HI> by Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on, "under colour of his office, and to promote and procure his own emolument,"</HI> and I now a&s;k, if ever a charge was more groundle&s;s! an imputation more &s;candalous! If the honourable accu&s;ers voted this article of impeachment without enquiring into its truth or fal&s;ity, <HI>their</HI> criminality is not le&s;s than <HI>that</HI> which they are plea&s;ed to impute to Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on!</HI> And if they voted it after enquiring, and knowing that it was not true, they have &s;inned in a &s;till greater degree. In the one ca&s;e, ignorance is no excu&s;e; in the other, knowledge aggravates the crime. What can be more clear than that the Commi&s;&s;ioner of Loans, neither wi&s;hed for any information from Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> nor re|lied upon that which he gave to the certificate hold|ers? What can be more clear than that it was re&s;erved
<PB N="617" REF="027132_0625_0FD353CEF6EB6708">
for the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury to determine, at the clo&s;e of the loan, in the year 1793, whether the cer|tificates were &s;ub&s;cribable or not; and this too, not from Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI>'s certification, but from authentic documents in the proper offices? and that the Com|mi&s;&s;ioner of Loans purpo&s;ely gave his receipts accord|ingly? What can be more clear, than that the Com|mi&s;&s;ioner of Loans &s;ent the certificate holders to Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> for no other purpo&s;e, than that he, being an experienced and well informed per&s;on, &s;hould examine their certificates, left at the clo&s;e of the loan in the year 1793 they might &s;u&s;tain a lo&s;s by lying out of the in|tere&s;t in the mean time, if the certificates &s;hould then be rejected? <HI>Nothing, I apprehend;</HI> and yet for the&s;e manifold, but di&s;intere&s;ted acts of <HI>kindne&s;s</HI> and <HI>benifi|cence,</HI> flowing from a heart of benevolence, and a di&s;|po&s;ition to oblige, Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> is impeached for a <HI>high crime and mi&s;demeanor!</HI> On the &s;ame principles might the charitable man, who&s;e good deeds are re|corded in <HI>holy writ,</HI> be impeached for helping the claud! directing the blind! comforting the widow! cheri&s;hing the fatherle&s;s! or relieving the beggar at his door! The motives of Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> appear to have been equally free from &s;ordid views or private gain.</P>
<P>I have not approved of his politics, Sir, but his well known kindne&s;s and benevolence of di&s;po&s;ition are virtues which command my re&s;pect, and I cannot but feel for the degraded honour of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> when I find the&s;e <HI>amiable virtues converted into a crime!</HI> If this has ari&s;en from a di&s;regard or culpable neglect of duty, by an omi&s;&s;ion of proper enquiry, it merits &s;evere ani|madver&s;ion;&mdash;if from the more ignoble cau&s;e of an&s;wer|ing party purpo&s;es, that animadver&s;ion &s;hould be li|mited by no re&s;traint.</P>
<P>If Sir, the evidence of young Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> &s;tood in need of &s;upport, which will not be alledged, it is afford|ed by the form of receipts con&s;tantly given by his late father, the former commi&s;&s;ioner of loans&mdash;"RECEIVED FOR EXAMINATION." What form of words could have

<P>Again; That the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, who at the clo&s;e of the loan, was finally to decide on the &s;ub|&s;cribability of all certificates that might be offered, had no idea of taking the lea&s;t notice of Mr. <HI>Nichol|&s;on</HI>'s little memorandum, given for the &s;atisfaction of individuals, appears from his letter of the 8th of June, 1791, to the Commi&s;&s;ioner of loans. (See page 273) In it he &s;ays, "It will not be proper that you commit the examination, and checking of the certificates of the a&s;&s;umed debt, to any per&s;on, who does not actually belong to your office. It cannot be deemed a legal ex|ecution of your duty, to rely upon any per&s;on not duly authori&s;ed. You will receive the&s;e certificates, and give on the delivery of them to you, and before com|pari&s;on with the checks, a de&s;criptive receipt for them, which will amount to no more than an acknowledgment that &s;uch certificates are placed in your hands, with a view to the loan. The &s;ub&s;cribers will be &s;en&s;ible, that the receipt cannot be deemed final, becau&s;e the &s;ub&s;criptions may exceed the a&s;&s;umption, and the cer|tificates may prove counterfeit or forged," After hear|ing this, will any man &s;uppo&s;e that the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, was &s;o little mindful of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him, as to commit it to others, or to have a &s;ingle thought about Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI>'s memorandum? After hearing the evidence of young Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> will any man &s;uppo&s;e, that his father did not act in exact conformity with tho&s;e directions; or that the Comptroller-Gene|ral, ever imagined, that he was doing any more than <HI>obliging individuals in his private capacity?</HI> and not <HI>under colour of office and with a view to his own emolument, endeavouring to defraud the public?</HI> That he did not act with a view to his own emolument, will if po&s;&s;ible, appear &s;till more clearly when we con&s;ider</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That he <HI>did not in a &s;ingle in&s;tance of his own, certify at all;</HI>&mdash;and</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="619" REF="027132_0627_0FD328380BB4BFF8">2d. That he certified <HI>in like manner under the fir&s;t loan, when no body &s;ub&s;cribed the New-Loan certificates, becau&s;e it was not their intere&s;t &s;o to do.</HI></P>
<P>Hence I conclude that the fir&s;t article contains no criminal charge, and if it did, yet that it is not &s;up|ported by a &s;hadow of evidence.</P>
<P>But, Mr. Speaker, I have &s;trong grounds of defence again&s;t this article, &s;till to bring forward, and which would be abundantly &s;ufficient to en&s;ure an acquittal, even if the fir&s;t charge were admitted to be &s;ufficient in point of law, and if it &s;hould be further admitted, that Mr. <HI>N.</HI> had in his <HI>official</HI> character, certified the New-Loan certificates to be &s;ub&s;cribable, when they <HI>were not &s;o.</HI></P>
<P>The article under con&s;ideration charges that the de|fendant <HI>recogni&s;ed, certified</HI> and <HI>declared,</HI> &amp;c. corruptly, and illegally, <HI>"as he the &s;aid</HI> John Nichol&s;on <HI>well knew."</HI> His accu&s;ers knew this to be e&s;&s;ential, to the con&s;tituting of the offence, and it has been admitted that proof of it is equally e&s;&s;ential.</P>
<P>Guilt can only flow from the corruptions of the heart, not from the errors or mi&s;taken opinions of the head. The former are e&s;&s;ential to guilt; the latter never con|&s;titute it where the intention is pure. It it incident to man to err, and therefore the law makes allowance for the frailty of human nature. The honorable accu&s;ers may in <HI>&s;ome things</HI> have mi&s;taken the law, and this rule might perhaps be very applicable in their ca&s;e. The learned judges upon the bench frequently differ in opi|nion&mdash;The mo&s;t upright and the mo&s;t enlightened of|ficer of government may mi&s;take the true con&s;truction of confu&s;ed, cla&s;hing, contradictory and ill penned laws, which in the bu&s;ine&s;s of his office he may have occa&s;ion to act upon&mdash;If however be acts hone&s;tly and uprightly &mdash;if he acts according to what he really believes the law to be, he at mo&s;t commits an error not a crime&punc; Did Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> then really believe the New-Loan debt to be &s;ub&s;cribable to the loan of the United States? If he did, an acquittal mu&s;t be the con&s;equence, whe|ther that opinion was <HI>right or wrong.</HI> We undertake
<PB N="620" REF="027132_0628_0FD353EB87147448">
to prove, not only that he was of this opinion at the time of his certifying, &amp;c. but that it was uniformly held and avowed by him from the commencement of the fir&s;t loan in September 1790, up to the clo&s;e of the &s;ub&s;cription to the &s;econd loan in July 1792, and that it is not changed.</P>
<P>It has appeared in evidence, Sir, that on the 30th of April 1790 the Commi&s;&s;ioner of Loans wrote a letter to Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> de&s;iring to be informed of the &s;everal kinds of State certificates then in circulation, as books were about to be opened for the receiving of &s;ub&s;crip|tions to the loan, and al&s;o de&s;iring to be furni&s;hed with &s;uch checks as would enable him to do the bu&s;ine&s;s with &s;afety to the United States (&s;ee page 271.) It is evi|dent that Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> made this application to Mr. <HI>Ni|chol&s;on,</HI> as being the per&s;on mo&s;t capable of furni&s;hing the nece&s;&s;ary information, and not as a per&s;on, who in his official capacity, was to give directions to be followed by Mr. <HI>Smith.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> &s;ays, <HI>"Such checks as will enable me to do that bu&s;ine&s;s with &s;afety to the United States."</HI></P>
<P>And it has further appeared, that on the &s;ame day, Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> wrote to Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> in an&s;wer, "Until I can give you a complete check, have enclo&s;ed herewith a blank form of a depreciation certificate, and one of funded debt, the only two kinds receivable by you, under the funding law of the United States granted by this State, <HI>as it is not pre&s;umable the New-Loans will be offered, &s;ubjected to the re&s;trictions in that law pre|&s;cribed"</HI>&mdash;You will be able to check tho&s;e left with you more particularly hereafter."</P>
<P>This letter fully proves, that he had no idea of the right of checking or determining on the a&s;&s;umability of the certificates him&s;elf, &s;ince he &s;peaks in unequivocal terms, of that being done hereafter by others, and it al&s;o proves the opinion of Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> at that early period to have been, that the New-Loan debts were &s;o far <HI>from being aboli&s;hed by the Act of</HI> 1789, <HI>as that they were &s;ub&s;cribable to the fir&s;t loan of the United States;</HI>
<PB N="621" REF="027132_0629_0FD353B2874B5328">
which differs not in this particular from the &s;econd one &mdash;It was not at that time the intere&s;t of the holders of New-Loan certificates to &s;ub&s;cribe them, &s;ince <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania</HI> had not pa&s;&s;ed, nor was it known that &s;he would pa&s;s the law for making up the lo&s;s on the three per cent. and deferred &s;tock. Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> a&s;&s;igned this as his rea&s;on for not &s;ending to Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> the blank form of a New-Loan certificate, and he al&s;o a&s;|&s;igned this as a rea&s;on for its "not being pre&s;umable that the New-Loans would be offered, &s;ubjected to the re&s;trictions in the Act of Congre&s;s pre&s;cribed."&mdash;This &s;hews his opinion of the exi&s;tence of the New-Loan debt notwith&s;tanding the Act of 1789; it &s;hews his opinion that, the New-Loan debt, though at that time <HI>unfunded,</HI> to be of greater value than an equal &s;um in &s;ix per cent. three per cent. and deferred &s;tock would be; and from his thinking it <HI>not pre&s;umable that the New-Loans would be offered, &s;ubjected to the re&s;trictions pre&s;cribed;</HI> and it is evident, that he believed other people judged of the exi&s;tence of the New-Loan debt, and of its being &s;ub&s;cribable, as he him&s;elf did:&mdash;If the&s;e were his &s;entiments, as they unque&s;tionably were, he cannot, whether they were right or wrong, have committed any offence, by acting conformably to them.</P>
<P>But, &s;ay the gentlemen, "This was mere pretence, a copy of his countenance only, and intended to de|ceive." But why mere pretence; why a copy of his countenance? Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> offered none of the New-Loans for &s;ub&s;cription under the fir&s;t loan, and there|fore his conduct accorded with his language expre&s;&s;ed in his letter, and this &s;urely &s;hews that he expre&s;&s;ed his real &s;entiments&mdash;Nor could he po&s;&s;ibly have any mo|tive for deception&mdash;He could not po&s;&s;ibly know in September 1790 that <HI>another</HI> Legi&s;lature would in the year 1791 make up the lo&s;s on the three per cent. and deferred &s;tock; nor that the loan of the United States would be extended or again opened in the year 1791; &mdash;nor that <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> would in the year 1792 pro|vide for the redemption at her Trea&s;ury of the New-Loan
<PB N="622" REF="027132_0630_0FD3541DD2040B98">
debt, which &s;hould at a future period be &s;ub&s;crib|ed and transferred&mdash;And yet without his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the power of looking into futurity, and having a pre-&s;ci|ence of all the&s;e things, there is no room for talking of a mere pretence in the year 1790, or &s;uppo&s;ing that he had any intention to deceive!</P>
<P>The gentlemen finding the opinion of Mr. <HI>Nichol|&s;on,</HI> at a time when he could have no inducement for di&s;gui&s;ing his real &s;entiments to be, that the New-Loan debt was not aboli&s;hed by the Act of 1789, and that it was &s;ub&s;cribable to the loan of the United States.&mdash; Exclaim what have we to do with his private opinions! If this exclamation has not received a &s;ufficient an&s;wer already, it is certainly afforded by the fir&s;t article, which charges, that the New-Loan debt was aboli&s;hed and that it was not &s;ub&s;cribable as he <HI>the &s;aid John Nic|hol&s;on well knew;</HI> and yet when we prove that he was &s;o far from knowing or believing this to be the ca&s;e, that he was really of a contrary opinion they exclaim;&mdash; what have we to do with his opinions! If this an&s;wer will not &s;atisfy the managers and the learned coun&s;el, they them&s;elves have afforded, one, which they cannot, without the mo&s;t palpable incon&s;i&s;tency now controvert. It mu&s;t be fre&s;h in the recollection of the honourable Senate, that it has been fully admitted, that if Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> has acted <HI>conformably to his opinion of the law, he cannot be guilty, even though that opinion may be wrong;</HI>&mdash;and yet, when we prove what his opinion really was and that he has acted in conformity with it, the &s;ame gentlemen exclaim;&mdash;what have be to do with his opinions!</P>
<P>But "out of the defendants own mouth," &s;ays bro|ther <HI>Dexter</HI> "&s;hall he be condemned," and he then produces, what he calls a condemnation, not from the defendants <HI>mouth,</HI> but from his <HI>pen.</HI> It is contained in a report, made in October 1790, (&s;ee page 389,) by the Comptroller General, to the General A&s;&s;embly, on the funds of the &s;tate, and the debts to be provided for&punc; In that report he brings into view, <HI>all the debts of the
<PB N="623" REF="027132_0631_0FD3541F520B2018">
&s;tate,</HI> as well the <HI>unfunded</HI> as the funded ones; as well tho&s;e which were <HI>redeemable</HI> by the then laws, as tho&s;e which had been excluded from redemption, and of cour&s;e would not be redeemable, until they &s;hould be made &s;o. He &s;hews what funds were then provided, and what further ones would be nece&s;&s;ary to defray the expences of government and di&s;charge &s;uch debts as were <HI>then</HI> redeemable at the Trea&s;ury&mdash;In doing this, he makes a deduction of the old unfunded depreciation certificates, becau&s;e they were not then <HI>redeemable,</HI> al|though they have &s;ince been made &s;o, and al&s;o, of the remainder of the New-Loan debt, becau&s;e that al&s;o was not <HI>redeemable.</HI> He of cour&s;e did not propo&s;e providing funds for the payment of either of them; and it would have appeared &s;trange indeed if he had, &s;ince neither of them was at that time payable at all. To di&s;tingui&s;h them however and to point out &s;uch as were then redeemable, and as it would require funds to be provided by the Legi&s;lature, he mentioned the &s;ituation of the old depreciation certificates, and he then mentioned the amount of the New-Loan debt re|maining on hand, and <HI>"excluded from redemption by the Act of March 1789;"</HI> and the&s;e words we are told contain <HI>his &s;entence of condemnation.</HI> If they do, it is expre&s;&s;ed in language which looks more like a decree of acquittal. The New-Loan debt had by the Act of 1786 been made <HI>redeemable</HI> at the Trea&s;ury and at the Land-office. By the Act of 1789 it was no <HI>longer</HI> re|deemable at either of the&s;e offices, or at any other office, and of cour&s;e was in the Comptroller-General's own words, <HI>"excluded from redemption by the Act of March 1789."</HI> This being the ca&s;e, no provi&s;ion was then nece&s;&s;ary for the payment of that, which was not then payable at all, and the defendant, therefore, with great propriety brought into one view, all the debts of the State, but at the &s;ame time, with equal propriety di&s;|tingui&s;hed between their various &s;ituations.</P>
<P>His conduct upon this occa&s;ion therefore, in&s;tead of affording his condemnation, affords the mo&s;t convinc|ing
<PB N="624" REF="027132_0632_0FD353D0774A3490">
grounds for his acquittal, &s;ince the <HI>bringing of the New-Loan debt into his report and ranking it among the debts of the State,</HI> clearly &s;hews, that he con&s;idered it as a &s;till exi&s;ting debt. If he did not; why would he have brought it into view at all, and been &s;o particular as he was, in &s;hewing by calculations the amount of it, which &s;till remained on hand? Why &s;hould he, an any other principles than tho&s;e which I have &s;tated, have taken any more notice of it, than of any of the former debts of the State which had been aboli&s;hed or di&s;|charged? Or if he con&s;idered this debt as aboli&s;hed, why did he not &s;ay <HI>aboli&s;hed,</HI> by the Act of 1789, in|&s;tead of EXCLUDED FROM REDEMPTION by it?</P>
<P>The next piece of evidence to which I &s;hall advert is, the letter of the 6th of June 1791 (page 272) from the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury to the Commi&s;&s;ioner of Loans, in which, he &s;ays, <HI>"In con&s;equence of an enquiry made of me,</HI> I think nece&s;&s;ary to inform you, that I con&s;ider the <HI>holders of certificates, received from the go|vernment of any State, in lieu of certificates of the Fe|deral debt, as having a right to &s;ub&s;cribe tho&s;e certificates to the loan of the a&s;&s;umed debt,</HI> and I con&s;ider the State, as having a right to &s;ub&s;cribe the Continental certifi|cates, which, they have obtained by the exchange, to the loan propo&s;ed by the Act of the 4th of Augu&s;t, 1790; but no intere&s;t is to be paid on the a&s;&s;umed debt of the State, either to the State, or <HI>to individuals,</HI> un|til you &s;hall be informed that I am &s;atisfied, that all the certificates &s;o i&s;&s;ued by the State, have been <HI>re-ex|changed</HI> or redeemed, or that all tho&s;e, which which &s;hall not be <HI>re-exchanged</HI> or <HI>redeemed, have been &s;ur|rendered to the U. S.</HI>&mdash;And in order, &s;ays he, "to di&s;tin|gui&s;h in a clear and &s;triking manner, <HI>this de&s;cription of N. L. certificates,</HI> from all others, I have determined to have a hole, of about one fifth of an inch, cut through a part, near the centre." He then directs, that when the &s;tock <HI>repre&s;ented in the&s;e certificates, &s;hould be transferred from and to the Loan-office or the Trea&s;ury,</HI> the transfer cer|tificates &s;hould have this central hole, cut or punched
<PB N="625" REF="027132_0633_0FD35420F7DCA4D8">
through them in like manner." And he concludes with &s;aying, that "in order to full information on this &s;ubject, I reque&s;t you to tran&s;mit to me a copy, or &s;uffi|cient extracts from any laws pa&s;&s;ed by the Legi&s;lature of the &s;tate in which you re&s;ide, relative to the ex|changes of Federal certificates, for tho&s;e of the &s;tate, and to <HI>the re-exchange of tho&s;e of the &s;tate for federal certificates;</HI> in doing which, you will be careful to col|lect whatever there may be."</P>
<P>The words in the beginning of this letter, <HI>"In con|&s;equence of an enquiry made of me,"</HI> &s;ufficiently &s;hews, that Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> had applied to the Secretary of the Trea|&s;ury for information, re&s;pecting the &s;ub&s;cribability of the New-Loan debt, and it can hardly be pre&s;umed, that &s;o indu&s;trious and well informed an officer, as the Se|cretary is, in all things relating to the duties of his office, was not at this time in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Act of March 1789. That he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, is more than probable, from what he &s;ays in this letter re&s;pect|ing the <HI>re-exchange</HI> of certificates&mdash;An <HI>exchange</HI> of cer|tificates took place under the law of March 1786, but there could be no <HI>re-exchange</HI> of them, but under the Act of March 1789. The Secretary could not there|fore have known, nor would he have talked of the <HI>re-exchange</HI> of certificates, had he not known of a law for that purpo&s;e; but he did &s;peak of a <HI>re-exchange,</HI> and therefore he mu&s;t have known of the law of 1789&mdash; But he went further, Sir, and ventured to act upon that law, for he tells the Commi&s;&s;ioner of Loans that <HI>no intere&s;t was to be</HI> paid on the New-Loan certificates until he &s;hould be &s;atisfied, that all of them had been <HI>re-exchanged</HI> or redeemed, or that all &s;uch as were not <HI>re-exchanged</HI> or redeemed, had been &s;urrendered to the United States." and as they could only be &s;urrendered to the United States, by being &s;ub&s;cribed, the&s;e la&s;t words &s;hew, <HI>as clearly as he had before expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the &s;ome letter, that</HI> HE THOUGHT THEM SUBSCRIBABLE.</P>
<P>But, Sir, in the latter part of this letter, he calls upon the Commi&s;&s;ioner of Loans, to tran&s;mit to him,
<PB N="626" REF="027132_0634_0FD353D1FA673F88">
a copy, or &s;ufficient extracts, from all the laws of the State relative to the <HI>exchange</HI> of Federal certificates for tho&s;e of the State, and to the <HI>re-exchange</HI> of tho&s;e of the State, for Federal ones. This call would hardly have been made, had he not known that there was a law for <HI>re-exchange;</HI> which law he was probably po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of, but as there might po&s;&s;ibly be further laws on the &s;ame &s;ubject, containing alterations or amend|ments, he very prudently called for copies or extracts of <HI>all laws relative thereto.</HI></P>
<P>If however it &s;hould be thought, that there is not &s;ufficient proof of his knowing at this time, of the law of 1789, it mu&s;t I think be admitted, that before writ|ing his next letter, he had received it from the Com|mi&s;&s;ioner of Loans&mdash;We find him by the la&s;t letter, calling upon that officer, for all laws on the &s;ubject;&mdash; <HI>in order to full information thereon.</HI> The great accur|acy and unwearied attention of that officer, to what|ever related to the duties of his office, are &s;o well known, as to forbid the idea, of his not having &s;hewn the mo&s;t prompt compliance with this call from the head of the department.</P>
<P>On the 8th of the &s;ame month, the Secretary again wrote to the Commi&s;&s;ioner as follows;&mdash;(page 274) "I do not con&s;ider you as ju&s;tifiable, in refu&s;ing the certificates of the State of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> which are in all other re&s;pects a&s;&s;umable, becau&s;e they have been re|ceived of the State, in lieu of Continental certificates. It will not however be improper, to u&s;e your endea|vours, to per&s;uade the holders to exchange them, but you cannot, if they per&s;i&s;t to offer, refu&s;e to receive them." In addition to the rea&s;ons already given for believing, that the Commi&s;&s;ioner as early as po&s;&s;ible furni&s;hed the laws which had been called for, permit me to remark, that after Secretary <HI>Hamilton,</HI> had cal|led for all the laws, &amp;c. "in order to full information on the &s;ubject," the &s;uppo&s;ition, that he decided in the very po&s;itive manner, which appears from this letter, without having received the law, and all the nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="627" REF="027132_0635_0FD353A1F333FC88">
information for forming a deci&s;ion, is too improbable, to be admi&s;&s;ible. That Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> had written or &s;ent to Col. <HI>Hamilton</HI> in an&s;wer to the fir&s;t of the&s;e letters, before the &s;econd was written, appears from a clau&s;e in the letter, approving of Mr. <HI>Smith's</HI> propo&s;al, of &s;tamping the certificates, in&s;tead of <HI>punching a hole near the centre,</HI> as Col. <HI>Hamilton</HI> had propo&s;ed. If &s;o, can it be imagined, that the laws which had been cal|led for, did not accompany the me&s;&s;age? or that, as the opinion now given, does not vary from the former one, it was not given on the &s;ame law?</P>
<P>But we are told that "The&s;e letters were not di|rected to the defendant, and as it is not in proof that he knew of them, they furni&s;h him with no apology." By the death of Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> we are deprived of his evi|dence, or this objection would not have been made.&mdash; It may neverthele&s;s be an&s;wered.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That the habits of intimacy, which prevailed between the Comptroller-General of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> and the Commi&s;&s;ioner of Loans of the United States, as well as their daily intercour&s;e in bu&s;ine&s;s, between <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania</HI> and the U. S. and which in a great degree re|lated to certificates of various kinds, furni&s;h &s;trong proof of the defendant's knowledge of the&s;e letters;&mdash;or,</P>
<P N="2">2d. If they do not; yet, by proving that the de|fendant was not &s;ingular in his opinion, but that many other well informed per&s;ons were of the &s;ame opinion, we have no room for a criminal intention being imput|ed to him&mdash;That this was really the ca&s;e, I &s;hall find no difficulty in e&s;tabli&s;hing.</P>
<P>The Secretary of the T. it is true, tells us, that he cannot now &s;ay, whether at the time of writing the&s;e let|ters he did or did not know of the Act of 1789; but as he al&s;o tells us, that he has not an accurate recollection of what pa&s;&s;ed in the early &s;tages of the bu&s;ine&s;s, his want of recollection does not weaken the force of the ob&s;erva|tions intended to &s;hew, that he mu&s;t have then known of that Act. Or if he did not then know of it, yet if there is &s;ufficient rea&s;on for believing, that Mr. <HI>N.</HI> knew of
<PB N="628" REF="027132_0636_0FD353ECF8F07E08">
the&s;e letters, without knowing that they had been written, without a knowledge of that law, the ca&s;e is not altered.</P>
<P>I believe, Sir, that I omitted to an&s;wer in its proper place, an objection which has been made; "That if in June 1791, the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury did know of the Act of 1789, yet that the que&s;tion did not pre|&s;ent it&s;elf to him, in "a prominent point of view."&mdash; This I can readily believe, &s;ince I can hardly conceive, that he &s;aw much difficulty ari&s;ing from it; or if he did, how could the defendant, or any body el&s;e know, of the degree of <HI>prominency,</HI> in which the que&s;tion had pre&s;ented it&s;elf to the Secretary, but from his letters, in which he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with great clearne&s;s and deci&s;ion?</P>
<P>It is &s;eriou&s;ly contended, Sir, "That the defendant, in <HI>violation of his duty,</HI> and in <HI>violation of his oath,</HI> neglected to inform Col. <HI>Hamilton</HI> of the Act of March 1789."</P>
<P>If this were the ca&s;e, let the defendant, <HI>for the &s;ake of ju&s;tice,</HI> be impeached for this offence, before he is condemned! The objection however proves one thing, and that is, that no arguments are too de&s;perate and groundle&s;s to be made u&s;e of, in order to affect the de|fendant's de&s;truction! Will tho&s;e who make u&s;e of this argument, venture to tell us, that it was the official duty of the Comptroller-General; <HI>an officer of</HI> Penn|&s;ylvania, to inform the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury; <HI>are officer of the United States, of the laws of</HI> Penn&s;ylvania! or that the defendant, <HI>had ever taken an oath to do &s;o!</HI> &mdash;If not, will they have &s;o much of the hardihood of veterans as to gravely contend, that a man can violate a duty, <HI>which never exi&s;ted;</HI>&mdash;or an oath, which <HI>was never ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">!</HI></P>

certificates, before their &s;ub&s;cription was offered to the loan of the United States.</P>
<P>It is further objected "That if the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury was once of the opinion, that the New-Loan certificates were &s;ub&s;cribable to the loan of the United States, yet that he afterwards altered his mind."&mdash;I &s;hall in the &s;equel have occa&s;ion to examine into the truth of this objection, and I will therefore only ob|&s;erve at pre&s;ent, that were this the ca&s;e, it militates, naught again&s;t the defendant, who could not po&s;&s;ibly know, that &s;uch a change would ever take place.</P>
<P>By an&s;wering the&s;e objections, I have in &s;ome mea|&s;ure been diverted from my regular chain of ob&s;erva|tion, intended to &s;hew, that the defendant really be|lieved, and that many others, mo&s;t likely to know, al&s;o believed, the New-Loan certificates to be &s;ub&s;criba|ble to the loan of the United States; and of cour&s;e, that no criminality is fairly imputable to him, even if that opinion were wrong. This chain of argument &s;hall now be re&s;umed and in tracing it I hope to prove, that Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on's</HI> opinion was as already mentioned, upon all occa&s;ions candidly, openly and uniformly a|vowed; that it was recogni&s;ed by others, who&s;e acquie&s;c|ence or explicit approbation confirmed him in it, and that if there has been any omi&s;&s;ion, in not giving the nece&s;&s;ary information to the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, it is not imputable to the defendant, but to a man much higher in office.</P>
<P>It is in evidence; that on the 27th of June, 1791, the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury wrote to the Governor, (page 275-6) that "The United States had directed, that the payment of intere&s;t &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended, in re&s;|pect to the debt of any &s;tate, which might have i&s;&s;ued its own certificates for tho&s;e of the United States, un|til it &s;hould appear to the &s;atisfaction of the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury that certificates i&s;&s;ued for that purpo&s;e by &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, had been <HI>re-exchanged</HI> or redeemed, or un|til <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which &s;hould not have been <HI>re-exchanged</HI> or redeemed, &s;hould be <HI>&s;urrendered to the United States,</HI>

and reque&s;ting his attention to the &s;ubject;" concluding by &s;aying, that "It would give certainty to the ope|rations of the Trea&s;ury, and might prevent delays inconvenient to the public creditors, if the Governor would direct the proper officers, to cau&s;e the &s;tate of the fact as it regarded <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> to be made appear to the Secretary."&mdash;This is the fir&s;t call that appears to have been made by the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, up|on any officer of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> for information re&s;pect|ing the &s;tate of her New-Loan certificates, and if the Governor believed, that &s;uch of them as had not been <HI>re-exchanged</HI> were aboli&s;hed by the Act of 1789, he had nothing to do, but <HI>at once to &s;ay &s;o,</HI> to the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, unle&s;s by his high office, he was exempt from an obligation, to be acquainted with tho&s;e laws which he was &s;wore to execute. In this letter, the Se|cretary of the Trea&s;ury, &s;peaks of the New-Loan cer|tificates, as being evidence of a debt of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> which might be &s;urrendered to the United States, or in other words, &s;ub&s;cribed to their loan, and if the Go|vernor thought the debt was aboli&s;hed, he had nothing to do but to &s;ay &s;o. Did the Governor at all contradict this idea, &s;o clearly expre&s;&s;ed by the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury? certainly not; but rather gave countenance to it, as appears by a letter written on the 1&s;t of July, in the &s;ame year, by Mr. <HI>Dallas</HI> to the defendant (page 276)&mdash;"It is written," &s;ays Mr. <HI>Dallas,</HI> "In obedience to in&s;tructions from the Governor,"&mdash;a "Copy of the letter from the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury was tran&s;mit|ted with it," and it reque&s;ted, that the defendant would "with all convenient &s;peed, make a report upon the &s;ubject to the Governor, accompanied with &s;uch &s;tate|ments as he &s;hould deem nece&s;&s;ary, to &s;atisfy the enquiry of the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, and the object of the law to which he referred."</P>
<P>In this letter, Sir, there is not a &s;ingle expre&s;&s;ion, which could po&s;&s;ibly lead the defendant, to dou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the propriety of his own opinion, but on the con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">y, it came from the highe&s;t &s;ource, and was, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

from the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, calculated to con|firm him in it&mdash;It contained no directions to &s;end the law of 1789 to the Secretary of the T. or to inform him, that by that law the New-Loan debt was aboli&s;hed. On the contrary, as the Secretary's letter admitted the New-Loan debt to be &s;ub&s;cribable, and as that written by Mr. <HI>Dallas</HI> in obedience to the Governor's direc|tion, was &s;o far from contradicting this idea, as to de|&s;ire a report, as to what part of the New-Loan debt had not <HI>been re-exchanged,</HI> and might therefore be &s;ur|rendered to the United States, it was &s;urely confirmatory of the defendant's opinion. What did the defendant do in con&s;equence of the&s;e two letters? why he on the next day reported to the Governor, that he had "Through the Secretary of the commonwealth, received a copy of a letter from the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, on the &s;ubject of certificates of &s;tate debt, i&s;&s;ued in lieu of Continental ones, and relative to the a&s;&s;umption there|of;" and the report then proceeds as follows, "As the regulations and provi&s;ions of this &s;tate, enable <HI>&s;uch cre|ditors</HI> to re-po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of continental certificates, received for them by the United States, I apprehend, the <HI>ca&s;e of &s;uch certificates of</HI> Penn&s;ylvania <HI>are fully provided for.</HI> However, if the Secretary of the Trea|&s;ury wi&s;hes to be informed of the quantity i&s;&s;ued by <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and now out, of this kind, and your excellency <HI>&s;hould chu&s;e to lay the &s;ame before him,</HI> I beg leave to repre&s;ent, that the whole quantity &s;o i&s;&s;ued was 5,167,695 33/99 dollars, of which 316,864 30/90 were redeem|ed by the &s;tate, and upwards of two thirds of the re|mainder have been returned in exchange for the Conti|nental certificates, and that the <HI>re&s;iduary &s;um is dimi|ni&s;hing daily by further applications and exchanges."</HI> Here we find the defendant in his report made in his <HI>official capacity</HI> to the Governor, declaring in the mo&s;t explicit terms, as he had before done, that the New-Loan debt &s;till exi&s;ted, as a debt of the commonwealth. The Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, had endeavoured to call the attention of the Governor to the &s;ubject; <HI>admit|ting

at the &s;ame time, that the New-Loan debt was &s;ub|&s;cribable to the loan of the United States,</HI> and al&s;o de&s;iring that he "would direct the proper officers to cau&s;e the &s;tate of the facts mentioned in his letter to be made appear to the Secretary." This the defendant did in his <HI>official capacity,</HI> in &s;uch clear and pointed language, that the Governor could not po&s;&s;ibly mi&s;under&s;tand his meaning. At the &s;ame time he expre&s;&s;ed his rea&s;on for being &s;o particular to be, lea&s;t "the Governor <HI>&s;hould chu&s;e to lay the &s;ame before the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury.</HI> Whether this report was or was not communicated to the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, does not I believe ap|pear. If it was not, the <HI>violation of duty and of oath,</HI> which has been mentioned, is not imputable to the defendant, &s;ince he was not called upon by the Secre|tary of the Trea&s;ury, and if he had, the call would have been improper. The Secretary called upon the Governor; <HI>he</HI> called upon the Comptroller-General, and the Comptroller-General immediately an&s;wered that call in &s;o particular a manner as to give the fulle&s;t information. This was the proper channel in which the bu&s;ine&s;s ought to be conducted; the Comptroller-General when called upon by his &s;uperrior, paid obedi|ence to that call, and if his an&s;wer was not made known by <HI>that</HI> &s;uperior, to the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, upon whom ought this heavy charge to fall? If upon either, certainly not upon the defendant. This evidence, Sir, mu&s;t not only acquit the defendant of the imputed charge of <HI>"a violation of his duty and of his oath,"</HI> has it mu&s;t do much more;&mdash;The Secretary of the Trea&s;u|ry had in his letter to the Governor, taken it for granted that the New-Loan debt &s;till exi&s;ted, and was &s;ub&s;crib|able, to the loan of the United States,&mdash;the Governor had acquie&s;ced in this opinion by not controverting it; the Comptroller-General had, in his report to the Governor openly avowed it; this avowal did not meet with the Governor's di&s;avowal, and as one of the mana|gers tells us, that the Governor is an <HI>extremely attentive and vigilant officer,</HI> the defendant had &s;urely rea&s;on to

&s;uppo&s;e, that he was not guilty of &s;o <HI>extraordinary a neglect,</HI> as not to communicate to the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, that report which had been called for, and which in con&s;equence of that call, the defendant had &s;ent to the Governor. The defendant had therefore every rea&s;on for &s;uppo&s;ing, that the Governor al&s;o thought, that the New Loan debt &s;till exi&s;ted and was &s;ub&s;cribable. If he was of that opinion, the defen|dant is guilty of no other offence, than that of being of the &s;ame opinion; and if the Governor thought otherwi&s;e, but remained &s;ilent, and without expre&s;&s;ing any di&s;approbation, either to the defendant, or to the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, the fault &s;hould re&s;t with him, <HI>attentive and vigilant as he is.</HI> Be this as it may, the Comptroller-General had every rea&s;on for &s;uppo|&s;ing, that his opinion was confirmed by that of the Governor, as well as by that of the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, and there is &s;urely no room to &s;uppo&s;e, that the <HI>former</HI> was ignorant of the law of 1789, &s;ince at the time of that law being pa&s;&s;ed, he filled an impor|tant &s;tation in the councils of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI>&mdash;In ob&s;erv|ing, Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, upon the report of the Comptroller-General, I ought to have ob&s;erved, that when &s;peaking of the holders of New-Loan certificates, he makes u&s;e of the&s;e words, <HI>"&s;uch creditors,"</HI> and the <HI>"ca&s;e of &s;uch certifi|cates of</HI> Penn&s;ylvania," and I do it now that the learn|ed and ingenious gentleman who is to follow me, may have an opportunity of explaining to us, how it is po&s;|&s;ible, that they could be <HI>creditors,</HI> in the opinion of the defendant, if he thought, <HI>their claims were aboli&s;hed, or the debt anihilated!</HI></P>
<P>From ought that appears, matters remained, I think, in this &s;ituation, till the 21&s;t of December following when the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, again wrote to the Governor (page 102) as follows&mdash;"It appearing to me, that the attention of the Legi&s;lature of <HI>Penn&s;ylva|nia,</HI> may be nece&s;&s;ary to the removal of an inconveni|ence, under which the &s;ub&s;cribers of the debt of the &s;tate now lie, I do my&s;elf the honor to make the re|qui&s;ite communication to your excellency.</P>

If it were po&s;&s;ible, as it certainly was not, for the Governor to have mi&s;appre|hended the defendant before, it cannot be alledged, that he could do it now&mdash;This report was made near three months after the fir&s;t loan was clo&s;ed; it was made more than five months before the law for opening of the &s;econd loan was pa&s;&s;ed; it was made more than three months before the law for the redemption at the Trea&s;ury of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> was enacted, and it is therefore impo&s;&s;ible for even credulity it&s;elf to ima|gine, that it does not expre&s;s the defendant's real opi|nion.</P>
<P>What is it natural to &s;uppo&s;e, the conduct, of the Governor on receiving this report would have been, if he was not clearly &s;atisfied that the defendant's opi|nion was right? Why he would, have put an end to the bu&s;ine&s;s, by telling both the defendant, and the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, that the <HI>New-Loan debt was aboli&s;hed,</HI> by the Act of 1789, but in&s;tead of this, he transmitted to the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, "That part of the report, which &s;tated the amount of the New-Loan certificates i&s;&s;ued, and redeemed, and the probable balance of the unexchanged certificates." (Page 277.) Why do this, if he thought <HI>that</HI> balance no longer a debt? Or why keep back the re&s;t of the report, if he thought it at all que&s;tionable, whether <HI>that</HI> balance was a debt or not? Surely no other rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned for either than that he had no doubt of
<PB N="639" REF="027132_0647_0FD35422363B29D8">
the exi&s;tence of the debt. That he really did think &s;o, appears from his "giving in&s;tructions to the defendant on the 27th of the &s;ame month (page 277) to confer with the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, in hopes that the difficulty &s;ugge&s;ted might be removed, without claim|ing the interpo&s;ition of the Legi&s;lature." The diffi|culty &s;ugge&s;ted aro&s;e from the danger of intere&s;t being twice payable by the U. S. that is to &s;ay, once on the New-Loan certificates, <HI>which could not be, if they were aboli&s;hed,</HI> and al&s;o on the Continental certificates, which the State had received in exchange for them; the Se|cretary of the Trea&s;ury had &s;ugge&s;ted different modes of obviating that difficulty, and he thought it worthy of the attention of the Legi&s;lature. The Governor knew, that if the <HI>New-Loan debt did not exi&s;t, the dif|ficulty &s;ugge&s;ted could not exi&s;t,</HI> and therefore, by in|&s;tructing the defendant to confer with the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, in hopes that <HI>that</HI> difficulty might be re|moved, he certainly expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ame opinion, to the defendant, which the defendant had expre&s;&s;ed to him.</P>
<P>In compliance with tho&s;e in&s;tructions from the Go|vernor, the defendant, on the 29th of the &s;ame month, wrote to the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, propo&s;ing a conference with him on the &s;ubject contained in his letter to the Governor. A conference took place, and the defendant in a letter to the Governor of February 29th, 1792, after informing him that all ob&s;tacles were removed, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf as follows;&mdash;(page 223) "The &s;ubject was an important one, and to have re|quired the Continental certificates from <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> while the New-Loans for which they were given, <HI>were out,</HI> and the State <HI>re&s;pon&s;ible for,</HI> without the&s;e means of redemption, would have placed her in an unplea&s;ant &s;ituation. To take off the appearance of this hard|&s;hip, it was &s;ugge&s;ted that in ca&s;e the New-Loans, not exchanged, would <HI>not be &s;ub&s;cribed to the loan of the U. S.</HI> by the holders, <HI>which on the propo&s;ed terms of the loan might be done,</HI> yet &s;till, that the State would by the terms of the &s;ame loan, be in the receipt of a &s;ufficient
<PB N="640" REF="027132_0648_0FD353BD2242DBD8">
&s;um from the Union, to meet the <HI>intere&s;t due to the&s;e creditors.</HI> But to this it was objected, that this receipt of intere&s;t by the State, would be temporary, and would cea&s;e when the &s;entiment of our accounts with the U. S. &s;hould be effected and the balances provid|ed for, agreeably to law, whereas the demand again&s;t the State <HI>would be perpetual, and could only be di&s;charg|ed by payment of the debt."</HI></P>
<P>This letter, like &s;everal of the communications o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which I have la&s;t ob&s;erved, was written <HI>after the fir&s;t loan was clo&s;ed, and long before the law for opening of the &s;econd one was pa&s;&s;ed.</HI> The defendant could have no motives for deception, and it therefore affords the mo&s;t conclu&s;ive evidence, that it contains his real opi|nion.</P>
<P>We have been told, Sir, that if this were the de|fendant's real opinion, he ought to have made it known to the Governor; that he concealed it from him, when it ought to have been communicated, and that he is therefore <HI>at all events</HI> criminal. If I were to make the extraordinary admi&s;&s;ion, that it is the duty of <HI>every</HI> officer of government, to tell the Governor his opinion, on <HI>all</HI> the laws of the State, and that <HI>every</HI> one who does not, is guilty of a criminal neglect! Yet, after this piece of evidence and &s;everal others which pre|ceded it, the objection, though <HI>&s;trongly urged</HI> by &s;e|veral gentleman, would be <HI>unworthy of a &s;erious re|futation.</HI></P>
<P>Here then, Sir, we have the fulle&s;t evidence, of an opinion, uniformly held and openly avowed by the de|fendant, on all occa&s;ions, in his public and private capacity, from the commencement of the bu&s;ine&s;s, up to the period at which I have arrived; and at times too, when it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to be intere&s;ted either way, or to have the lea&s;t inducement to expre&s;s &s;enti|ments which were not his own. We find this opinion, not only acquie&s;ced in by the Commi&s;&s;ioner of Loans, but we find him during all this period, countenanced and confirmed in it by repeated acts, both of the Se|cretary
<PB N="641" REF="027132_0649_0FD3544C731EAF68">
of the Trea&s;ury and the Governor of the com|monwealth.</P>
<P>I will now go further and &s;hew, that he not only continued to be of the &s;ame opinion, but that he was candid, open, and even <HI>a&s;&s;iduous</HI> in making it known to the Governor, and to the members of both branch|es of the Legi&s;lature, while the law of April 1792, for the redemption of the &s;tate debts was under con&s;i|deration. In doing this, I &s;hall al&s;o &s;hew, that his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ion was not di&s;countenanced by any of them, that it was countenanced by many if not by all of them, and that he had not the lea&s;t hint from any body of his be|ing wrong, until the tran&s;actions had taken place, which gave ri&s;e to the pre&s;ent pro&s;ecution. If I do this, I may add, that it is almo&s;t a crime, to impute criminality to him.</P>
<P>The law for the redemption of the &s;tate debts, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s already been &s;hewn, was pa&s;&s;ed on the 10th of A|pril 1792. While the bill for that purpo&s;e was de|pending before the Hou&s;e, the defendant drew up a propo&s;ed plan of finance. It enumerated the various debts of the &s;tate, proper and nece&s;&s;ary to be redeemed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d among others we find the New-Loan debt, placed in a con&s;picuous point of view. It is entitled "A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for modifying the pre&s;ent debt of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,"</HI> and the 8th enumerated debt (page 280 and 284) is &s;poken of in the following words,</P>
<P><HI>"The New-Loan certificates and arrearages of inter|e&s;t, about, &s;ay</HI> &pound;. 20,000</P>
<P>It is propo&s;ed that the&s;e certificates &s;hould be receiv|ed, with the arrears of their intere&s;t, on the &s;ame terms on the other preceding debts of the &s;tate. The holders neverthele&s;s to be continued in the priviledge of ex|changing them as at pre&s;ent. But it would &s;eem pro|per, that after due notice, &s;o as not to extend to the period of the next loan by Congre&s;s, a limitation &s;hould by law be put to &s;uch power of exchanging, that here|after, the Continental certificates &s;hould be &s;ub&s;cribed for the u&s;e of the &s;tate, and that the &s;tate, having pro|vided
<PB N="642" REF="027132_0650_0FD353F98BDBC440">
for the redemption of &s;uch as might remain un-exchanged, un&s;ub&s;cribed to the loan herein propo&s;ed, or <HI>un&s;ub&s;cribed to the a&s;&s;umption of the &s;tate debts,</HI> &s;hould declare, that intere&s;t &s;hould thenceforth cea&s;e thereon, unle&s;s payment were demanded. No &s;um is extended in this ca&s;e, as the Continental certificates will be in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tate, to be appropriated to this debt, as far the &s;ame may be &s;ub&s;cribed as herein propo&s;ed."&mdash;That this propo&s;ed plan of finance was laid before the Governor, appears by a letter to the de|fendant from Mr. <HI>Dallas</HI> of the 21&s;t of March 1792, (page 286) in which, after mentioning the plan, he &s;ays; "The Governor has con&s;idered the &s;ubject, and will probably determine to-morrow, how far it would be proper, to tran&s;mit the plan to the Legi&s;lature." At this time another plan of finance was before the Hou&s;e, it was &s;o far advanced, and &s;o nearly matured, and the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion was &s;o near at hand, as to account for no interference, for we do not find that any took place, on the part of the Governor; but however this may be, it certainly appears, that at this import|ant cri&s;is, the defendant <HI>again avowed</HI> the opinion which he had uniformly held, and the propriety of which the Governor did not upon this, any more than upon any former occa&s;ion, think proper to controvert.&mdash;Mr. <HI>Dallas</HI> indeed tells us, that he never had an idea, or heard an idea, for I do not recollect which was his ex|pre&s;&s;ion, of the New-Loan debt being &s;ub&s;cribable to the loan of the United States, until June 1792, when he learned that it had been &s;ub&s;cribed by the defendant. This may be true for ought that I know, and yet if he had any ideas at all I can hardly conceive it po&s;&s;ible, &s;ince it has appeared, that he was privy to the corre&s;|pondence between the defendant, the Governor and the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, in which this opinion was clearly expre&s;&s;ed and openly avowed without the lea&s;t contradiction. He wrote and he tran&s;mitted to the de|fendant the Governor's directions on that &s;ubject; ac|companying the letters of Secretary <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and I
<PB N="643" REF="027132_0651_0FD354271EDE67A0">
&s;uppo&s;e him to have had the copying, and recording of all the corre&s;pondence on that occa&s;ion&mdash;If other proof be nece&s;&s;ary, it is amply afforded by his letter to the defendant of the 21&s;t March 1792 (page 286) in which he &s;ays, "I find from con&s;ulting <HI>Mr. Gallatin,</HI> and &s;everal other gentlemen, that your plan would not at this time, meet with any chance of &s;ucce&s;s, <HI>though its principles appear to me to be good."</HI></P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Dallas,</HI> in who&s;e hands this plan of finance was, never read it, how could "its principles appear to him to be good!" If he did read it, how is it po&s;&s;ible, that until he heard of the New-Loan debt being &s;ub|&s;cribed by the defendant in June 1792, he never had an idea, or heard of an idea of its being &s;ub&s;cribable! This is not however worth dwelling upon, and I &s;hall therefore proceed to what is much more material.&mdash;It is in evidence Sir, that copies of this plan of finance were, at about the &s;ame time communicated to &s;everal active and intelligent members of each branch of the Legi&s;lature. The evidence has been heard, and I will not wa&s;te time in an u&s;ele&s;s enumeration of a long &s;tring of names, but I mu&s;t remark, that not <HI>one,</HI> of them, ever &s;ignified the &s;malle&s;t <HI>di&s;approbation of that part of it, which propo&s;ed a provi&s;ion for the redemption of the New-Loan debt.</HI> Hence the conclu&s;ion was war|rantable on the part of Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> that <HI>they too,</HI> as well as the Governor, had no doubt of the exi&s;tence of the New-Loan debt, and of the obligation of the &s;tate to redeem it.</P>
<P>I am now arrived Sir, at a mo&s;t important &s;tage of the bu&s;ine&s;s;&mdash;At the time when the bill for, the re|demption law, as it is called, was pending before the Hou&s;e, and we find at this time the defendant de|claring to each branch of the Legi&s;lature as he had upon all former occa&s;ions done, the exi&s;tence of the New-Loan debt, that it ought to be redeemed, and &s;o far are we from finding any di&s;approbation of this &s;enti|ment, from any one of them, that we find it <HI>acquie&s;ced in by all, and condemned by none.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="644" REF="027132_0652_0FD353BE8553B560">Their evidence is before you, Sir, and without &s;pend|ing time in repeating it, permit me to remind the ho|norable Senate, that, it is as full as evidence can po&s;&s;ibly be, not only to &s;hew the real opinion of the defendant, but the pains taken by him to make that opinion fully known, and that wherever it was known it was approved of, &s;ince we do not find it contradicted by any one of tho&s;e, who&s;e peculiar province it was to do &s;o, if its propriety was at all que&s;tioned.&mdash;Nay the honorable Mr. <HI>Thomas</HI> of the Senate tells us, that Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> in a conver&s;ation with him, objected to the plan of finance then before the Hou&s;e, becau&s;e it would injure the com|monwealth, by opening a door for &s;peculation at her expence, and we find him at the &s;ame time offering another which was &s;o plain; &s;o &s;imple and &s;o ea&s;y to be under&s;tood, as to preclude every thing of this kind.&mdash; Was this al&s;o cant and hypocri&s;y too? was it al&s;o a mere copy of his countenance, and intended to deceive, when it is well known, that the law for extending the loan, did not pa&s;s until the 8th of May following! And yet Sir, the defendant is again charged with &s;ecrecy and covert views! But upon what grounds is he &s;o charged? why &s;ay the gentlemen; we do not know what deep de|&s;igns of &s;peculation, at the expence of the public, were concealed under this plan of finance!" And if after &s;o may months of laborious indu&s;try, they have not been able to find them out, will they &s;eriou&s;ly &s;ay, that the honorable Senate are to pre&s;ume them, and on pre&s;umption only, without either a charge, or evidence, to condemn the defendant! Forbid it virtue! forbid it ju&s;tice! forbid it patrioti&s;m! or to include them all, forbid it law!</P>
<P>But &s;ay Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on's</HI> accu&s;ers; "he never thought of the New-Loan debt being &s;ub&s;cribable, until after the pa&s;&s;ing of the redemption law of the 10th of April 1792."</P>
<P>Need I after all which has been &s;hewn, an&s;wer this objection? Certainly not; unle&s;s it be to ob&s;erve, that of it&s;elf, <HI>if true,</HI> it does away all his former <HI>imputed</HI> &s;ins
<PB N="645" REF="027132_0653_0FD353B1347F1A28">
and iniquities, &s;ince in that ca&s;e every thing which had been imputed to him before, mu&s;t be groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>Again, Sir, we are told, "That while the bill for the redemption law of April 1792 was depending be|fore the Legi&s;lature, Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> &s;atisfied him&s;elf with mentioning <HI>little, trifling objections,</HI> but that he never told any body that the New-Loan debt would be redeemable under it."&mdash;To this I could, were it ne|ce&s;&s;ary, give many an&s;wers; but I &s;hall &s;atisfy my&s;elf with ob&s;erving,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That had he made no objections whatever, he would not have been liable to impeachment on that account, any more than tho&s;e who &s;tate this objection are, and that if this is a criminal omi&s;&s;ion, <HI>they</HI> are no le&s;s liable to puni&s;hment for it, than he is, &s;ince they were under no le&s;s obligation than he was.</P>
<P N="2">2d. That at the time of the objections, which are now called trifling, being made by the defendant, a report of a committee (&s;ee Journals of Congre&s;s of the 2d April 1792) was under con&s;ideration, which if it had been adopted by Congre&s;s, would have rendered the old unfunded bills of credit &s;ub&s;cribable to the loan of the United States. When the bill for the redemp|tion law was before the Hou&s;e, the defendant very pro|perly objected, that &s;hould that report be adopted in its full extent, and &s;hould the bill then pa&s;s in its then form, the&s;e bills would be redeemable at the Trea&s;ury of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> However trifling this objection may now be thought, it was con&s;idered as of &s;o much weight at that time, that this part of the report was rejected, and if it had not, the law of April 1792 was &s;o framed as in its then form to admit of their redemption. And,</P>
<P N="3">3d. That if the defendant did not &s;tate as an ob|jection to the propo&s;ed law of April 1792, that the New-Loan debt would be redeemable under it, it was becau&s;e he then did, and always had believed in the exi&s;tence of that debt; becau&s;e his own plan of finance propo&s;ed its redemption;&mdash;becau&s;e he had every rea&s;on for believing that the Governor and each branch of the
<PB N="646" REF="027132_0654_0FD35393604ACCC8">
Legi&s;lature thought as he did in this re&s;pect; and that therefore, it would have been madne&s;s in the extreme for him, to object to what he him&s;elf propo&s;ed in his own plan of finance, and which he not only highly ap|proved of, but had every rea&s;on for &s;uppo&s;ing to be equally approved of by others.</P>
<P>I will not, Sir, attempt any further an&s;wer to this objection, le&s;t in combating &s;uch ground, I may be led into an intemperate warmth.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, Sir, that "The Governor could not have been of the opinion, that the New-Loan debt was re|deemable at the Trea&s;ury of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> or that it exi&s;ted at all, &s;ince in none of his addre&s;&s;es to the Le|gi&s;lature, one or more of which have been read, has he mentioned this debt to be provided for, although he has particularly enumerated all that were to be pro|vided for." This argument, though much relied on, will be found to be altogether fallacious. The New-Loan debt was not redeemable at all, until the pa&s;&s;ing of the redemption law of the 10th of April 1792, nor then, unle&s;s the loan of the United States &s;hould be again opened&mdash;It was not again opened until the 8th of May 1792, and of cour&s;e no provi&s;ion for its redemp|tion, could be required before that time. The addre&s;|&s;es which have been read, were all anterior to this pe|riod&mdash;Their object was to enumerate the amount of the <HI>debts which were redeemable,</HI> and of cour&s;e demandable at the Trea&s;ury, and to call upon the Legi&s;lature, to <HI>furni&s;h the nece&s;&s;ary means;</HI> but as the New-Loan debt was not <HI>then redeemable nor demandable,</HI> at the Trea|&s;ury, it would have been &s;trange indeed, if our <HI>vigilant</HI> Governor, had &s;o far forgotten him&s;elf, as to call for <HI>means to be provided, for redeeming a debt,</HI> which <HI>at that time was not redeemable at all!</HI></P>
<P>Of a &s;imilar nature is another objection which has been made; "That in no in&s;tance have the committee of ways and means propo&s;ed any provi&s;ion for the re|demption of the New-Loan debt," from which it is inferred, that it had been aboli&s;hed, or if not aboli&s;h|ed,
<PB N="647" REF="027132_0655_0FD353D4F7452B80">
that it was not redeemable." To this the an&s;wer mu&s;t certainly be &s;atisfactory, that the reports of this committee were, like the addre&s;&s;es of the Governor, made <HI>before the New-Loan debt was redeemable,</HI> and of cour&s;e the propo&s;ing of <HI>ways and means</HI> for its <HI>redemption</HI> would have been folly in the extreme&mdash;It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of that committee, as appears from its very name, to pro|po&s;e <HI>ways and means,</HI> for di&s;charging &s;uch debts as are <HI>redeemable,</HI> but it would be a great departure from its duty, to propo&s;e a law for any other purpo&s;e, unle&s;s under a particular reference from the Hou&s;e. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of that committee, to find out <HI>ways</HI> and <HI>ways for the redemption of funded debts,</HI> not <HI>unfunded ones!</HI></P>
<P>Equally un&s;ub&s;tantial is another objection, which has been made; namely, "That the defendant could not believe the New-Loan debt to be redeemable, becau&s;e his own &s;tatement, made at, or &s;oon after the pa&s;&s;ing of the Act of the 10th of April 1792, mentioned &s;o &s;mall a &s;um, as a propo&s;ed e&s;timate, of what would be ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the redemption of the public debts, as &s;hews that it was not intended to provide for the di&s;charge of the New-Loan debts." <HI>Nor was it;</HI> and this I freely admit, without allowing that there is any weight in the objection. The&s;e e&s;timates bear date the 28th and 30th of April 1792 (page 224-5) and mention a "&s;um e&s;timated to be nece&s;&s;ary for the redemption of the State <HI>debt, according to law."</HI> But the New-Loan debt was not redeemable until the 8th of May follow|ing, when the Act of Congre&s;s for opening the &s;econd loan was pa&s;t, and therefore, when the&s;e e&s;timates were made, the New-Loan debt was not payable <HI>"accord|ing to law,"</HI> nor would it ever have been payable under the then exi&s;ting laws, had that loan not again been opened. If this is not a complete an&s;wer to the objec|tion, I hope the following one will be&mdash;It will be re|membered that the &s;econd &s;ection of the Act of the 10th of April 1792 provided for the payment of certain debts therein enumerated, and we have admitted that the New-Loan debt was not one of them, although it
<PB N="648" REF="027132_0656_0FD353D81F411558">
was, as we &s;ay, within the provi&s;ion of the &s;ixth &s;ec|tion and eventually became payable under the 12th ap|propriation of the Act of April 1791. The 2d &s;ection of the Act of April 1792 provided funds for the debts enumerated in that &s;ection, and in order thereto, it enabled "The Comptroller-General and Regi&s;ter-General, under the direction of the Governor, to fell &s;o much of the three <HI>per cent.</HI> &s;tock as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary to pay and re|deem the debt in that &s;ection mentioned." On the 13th of April 1792 (page 232) Mr. <HI>Dallas</HI> by order of the Governor, wrote to the Comptroller-General and Re|gi&s;ter-General as follows&mdash;"The Legi&s;lature contem|plates the payment of <HI>certain</HI> debts on <HI>the fir&s;t of July next,</HI> by the &s;ale of <HI>three</HI> per cent. <HI>&s;tock,</HI> at a certain rate, with a power however, to &s;u&s;pend the &s;ale until the &s;tipulated price can be obtained, you will be plea&s;|ed therefore, to take that Act into immediate con&s;ide|ration, and report what arrangements will be nece&s;&s;ary in your opinion, for carrying the redemption of the debt into effect."</P>
<P>The three <HI>per cent.</HI> &s;tock was not directed to be &s;old for the payment of the New-Loan debt, nor was pro|vi&s;ion made for the payment of that debt <HI>on the fir&s;t of July next, nor at all,</HI> unle&s;s the loan &s;hould be again opened; the Governor could only call for an e&s;timate of what would be nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;charge the debts, which were payable on the fir&s;t of July; the e&s;timate furni&s;hed was confined to that object, and could not be extended to any other; the three <HI>per cent.</HI> &s;tock could not be &s;old to &s;atisfy any other object. When gentle|men are driven to &s;uch objections as this, their &s;ituation mu&s;t be de&s;perate indeed!</P>
<P>Oh! but &s;ay the gentlemen, "The defendant did not inform Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> as he ought to have done, that the New-Loan debt was redeemable under the Act of April 1792." If I admit for a moment, that there was &s;omething &s;o peculiar in the character of Mr. <HI>Gallatin,</HI> as to entitle him to more information than
<PB N="649" REF="027132_0657_0FD3544DCF056DB0">
other members could ju&s;tly claim, let us &s;ee how well the objection is &s;upported by facts.</P>
<P>We find Mr. <HI>Dallas</HI>'s letter to the defendant of the 21&s;t of March 1792, that he found on con&s;ulting <HI>Mr. Gallatin,</HI> and &s;ome other gentlemen on the <HI>defend|ant's plan,</HI> that it would not at that time meet with any chance of &s;ucce&s;s, "though its <HI>principles appeared to be good,"</HI> Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> was therefore informed of the defendant's opinion while the bill for the redemption law was pending, and if he thought it wrong, he ought to have &s;aid &s;o, and guarded again&s;t it.&mdash;Let us now &s;ee what took place after the law was pa&s;&s;ed?&mdash;It was pa&s;&s;ed as we have &s;een on the 10th of April 1792 &mdash;the Hou&s;e probably ro&s;e on that or the next day, as no law was pa&s;&s;ed after that day, in the &s;ame &s;e&s;&s;ion; and as Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> tells us, that he remained in town but about eight or ten days after the ri&s;ing of the Hou&s;e, the conver&s;ation which I am about to mention, mu&s;t have taken place within that time&mdash;It is related by Mr. <HI>Donnald&s;on,</HI> who &s;wears "That &s;hortly after the Hou&s;e ro&s;e, Mr. <HI>Gallatin,</HI> the defendant and him&s;elf, had conver&s;ation together, in which <HI>they all agreed,</HI> that the Act of the 10th of April 1792, embraced the <HI>Unfunded Depreciation debt,</HI> and the defendant then &s;aid, it would extend to the old bills of credit if Con|gre&s;s &s;hould a&s;&s;ume them, upon which Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> &s;aid the 6th &s;ection was more exten&s;ive than he had intended. And Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> tells us, that on reading the 6th &s;ection he agreed with the defendant in his con|&s;truction of it as to its including the Unfunded De|preciation debt&mdash;If this was &s;o, it could not be a pro|vi&s;o to the &s;econd &s;ection, &s;ince it is admitted on both &s;ides, that <HI>that</HI> &s;ection does not include that debt; of cour&s;e we have here the opinion of Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> in our favour, be it of the importance or not, which upon an|other occa&s;ion has been contended for. Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> does not at pre&s;ent recollect any thing having been &s;aid about the old bills of credit being redeemable, if Con|gre&s;s &s;hould a&s;&s;ume them, but Mr. <HI>Donnald&s;on,</HI> who
<PB N="650" REF="027132_0658_0FD353A376DF8FC8">
&s;peaks affirmatively, &s;wears that the defendant did &s;ay, that they would be within the &s;ixth &s;ection if Congre&s;s &s;hould a&s;&s;ume them, and that Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> then &s;aid, the &s;ixth &s;ection was more exten&s;ive than he had in|tended, which certainly looks very much like a&s;&s;enting to what the defendant had &s;aid&mdash;Mr. <HI>Donnald&s;on</HI> does not, it is true, remember, that the New-Loan debt was &s;poken of, and the defendant has been pretty &s;e|verely handled for not mentioning that al&s;o; but to this it may be an&s;wered, that Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> having heard of &s;ome objections to the Act, went to learn what they were, and to endeavour to obviate them&mdash;This being the ca&s;e, the defendant mentioned only &s;uch things as he deemed exceptionable, and it would have been won|derful indeed, if he had mentioned as an objection to the Act, that it might <HI>eventually</HI> provide for the re|demption of the New-Loan debt, when <HI>he him&s;elf</HI> had ju&s;t before propo&s;ed a plan, which provided for its <HI>im|mediate</HI> redemption, and which he had every rea&s;on for believing, was approved of by the Governor and the members of both branches of the Legi&s;lature. To &s;hew that he has been candid and uniform in every thing relative to this bu&s;ine&s;s, it is but ju&s;tice to re|member, that while the Act of April 1792 was de|pending before the Legi&s;lature, he thought it his duty to give it every decent oppo&s;ition, and that he did &s;o, by mentioning his objections in the fulle&s;t manner to many members of each branch of the Legi&s;lature, and more e&s;pecially as it would in its then form, if the re|&s;olutions then under the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s had been adopted in their full extent, have put the &s;tate in the power of the United States, by making her liable to redeem whatever Congre&s;s might chu&s;e to a&s;&s;ume. To prevent this, his plan enumerated the &s;pecific articles of redemption, and &s;urely nothing could be better cal|culated than this, to pre&s;erve the rights of the State, and to preclude all opportunity for &s;peculation&mdash;To the honorable Mr. <HI>Thomas</HI> be objected "to the bill as it &s;tood, (page 287) becau&s;e it would admit of con&s;truc|tions
<PB N="651" REF="027132_0659_0FD353C0DA758770">
that would open a door for &s;peculation, and for &s;peculations injurious to the State." To the honorable Mr. <HI>Montgomery</HI> he mentioned nearly the &s;ame thing; (page 290) and if after this, the Legi&s;lature cho&s;e to leave the door open, every man had a right to enter at it, and none more &s;o than he, who had advi&s;ed that it &s;hould be &s;hut.</P>
<P>If the law left it open, the law gave a free pa&s;&s;port of entrance to every man, and it is an affront to common &s;en&s;e to &s;uppo&s;e that for availing him&s;elf of it, any man can be puni&s;hable!</P>
<P>We are told, Sir, "That at all events the defendant was highly culpable for certifying to the Governor in favour of the holders of the old Unfunded Deprecia|tion certificates, becau&s;e Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> had told him that it was not <HI>his</HI> intention when the law of April 1792 pa&s;&s;ed, that they &s;hould be redeemable." Be it &s;o; but if it is, what is the con&s;equence? Was the defend|ant to con&s;true the law agreeably to what a <HI>&s;ingle member</HI> of a <HI>&s;ingle branch</HI> told him was <HI>his meaning</HI> at the time, or according to what appeared on a <HI>view of the law,</HI> to have been the <HI>meaning of all the members of both bran|ches and of the Governor!</HI> Mr. <HI>Gallatin's</HI> conduct, and where he happens to be right, I have no objection to quoting him, forms a &s;ufficient an&s;wer to this objec|tion&mdash;It is in evidence, that he &s;aid, he had not in|tended that the &s;ixth &s;ection of the Act of April 1792 &s;hould be more exten&s;ive than the &s;econd &s;ection; but that on peru&s;ing it, he found that it was, and that it included the Unfunded Depreciation certificates.&mdash;He al&s;o tells us, that finding this to be the ca&s;e, he pro|cured the redemption of one for his friend <HI>Ephraim Dougla&s;s</HI>&mdash;He adds with much good &s;en&s;e, that if he had known that agreeably to the true con&s;truction of the law, the New-Loan debt was redeemable, he &s;hould, let the intention of the Legi&s;lature be what it might, have done the be&s;t that he could for his friend&mdash;All this is pa&s;t over as perfectly innocent, &s;o far as it re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ates to the conduct of one of the members of the Le|gi&s;lature,
<PB N="652" REF="027132_0660_0FD35394F3413F10">
who is the author, and the fautor of this pro&s;e|cution, and yet, the defendant is held up as a great criminal, for certifying to the Governor in favour of the holders of the old Unfunded Depreciation certifi|cates, although that member, and the Regi&s;ter-Gene|tal had agreed that it was right! although that member had procured a certificate of this kind in favour of his friend; and although it was <HI>fir&s;t done,</HI> in favour of the Speaker of the Senate at the time of pa&s;&s;ing the law, and afterwards in favour of able law judges!</P>
<P>But, &s;ay the gentlemen, "Let the defendant's opi|nion have been one way or the other, it was <HI>imprudent</HI> in him to &s;ub&s;cribe the New-Loan debt, without fir&s;t informing the Governor of his intentions." The Go|vernor may perhaps be a very proper per&s;on to con&s;ult in a ca&s;e of prudence, but if he is &s;o, and if, which I am far from admitting, prudence required that he &s;hould have been con&s;ulted; is a mere act of imprudence a &s;uf|ficient ground for an impeachment? If it is, I am afraid that a thou&s;and articles would be maintainable again&s;t the be&s;t man among us, and that even &s;ome of the ma|nagers might &s;tand high on the li&s;t of criminals! If the accu&s;ers are obliged to have recour&s;e to this ground, the defendant &s;hould not have been impeached for vi|olating the laws of the State, but for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the rules of prudence!</P>
<P>But, &s;ay the pro&s;ecutors, "Whatever may have been the defendant's opinion, the commonwealth has &s;u&s;|tained much damage by the &s;ub&s;cription of the New-Loan debt, and that he is therefore re&s;pon&s;ible." Even if this po&s;ition were true, it could at mo&s;t but apply in a civil action and not in a criminal pro&s;ecution, where the rule is, <HI>actus non &s;it reus ni&s;i mens &s;it rea.</HI> But I deny the truth of the a&s;&s;ertion altogether. Twen|ty &s;hillings in the pound were ju&s;tly due? <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> by the Act of March 1786 was &s;olemnly pledged to pay twenty &s;hillings in the pound, and that right and ju&s;tice required that this &s;um &s;hould be paid, is ac|knowledged by the Act of April 1791 for making up

<P><PB N="654" REF="027132_0662_0FD3544F4FD6B000">Mr. <HI>Lewis</HI> then proceeded&mdash;</P>
<P>In order &s;till further to &s;hew, that the defendant con|ceived his con&s;truction of the law to be right, and that he believed other gentlemen to be of the &s;ame opinion, permit me now to remind the honorable Senate, of the evi|dence of the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury. He &s;wears that <HI>"all the difficulties on which he &s;o often wrote to the Governor;</HI> on <HI>which the Governor ordered the conference,</HI> and on <HI>which the conference was held and conducted, en|tirely aro&s;e on the &s;uppo&s;ition, of the New-Loan debt be|ing &s;ub&s;cribable,</HI> and that they <HI>could not have exi&s;ted, but on this point being acceded to."</HI> That in the confer|ence Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> appeared to be of this opinion, and the Governor afforded abundant rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that he was of the &s;ame opinion.</P>
<P>After hearing this evidence, no man can doubt of what the opinion of the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury was; &mdash;no man can doubt what the opinion of the Governor was, no man can doubt what the opinion of the de|fendant was, nor, but that he believed the&s;e gentlemen to be of the &s;ame opinion, &s;ince if they had not, as the Secretary tells you, the difficulties could not have ari&s;en, nor could the conference have been nece&s;&s;ary. The defendant mu&s;t have perceived this as clearly as the Se|cretary did, and unle&s;s, which is not pre&s;umable, he &s;uppo&s;ed the Governor to be de&s;titute of common &s;en&s;e, or totally regardle&s;s of all &s;en&s;e of duty, he could not imagine that he would <HI>have called for reports, talked of calling the Legi&s;lature, or directed a conference without being of the &s;ame opinion.</HI></P>
<P>But, again, Sir, it appears, that Judge <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> had applied to have a New-Loan certificate &s;ub&s;cribed and redeemed, and that the defendant from mere kindne&s;s undertook to get it done for him&mdash;That while that ap|plication was depending, Mr. <HI>Dallas</HI> objected to the defendant, that it was not authori&s;ed by law, and this was the fir&s;t time of &s;uch an idea being &s;ugge&s;ted by any one. The defendant an&s;wered him, that he <HI>was &s;ure he was right;</HI> and what clearly proves that he
<PB N="655" REF="027132_0663_0FD35429E9CF9148">
thought &s;o is, that as Judge <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> was going out of town, the defendant, after <HI>this objection had been made,</HI> paid him the full amount of his certificate, as if it had been actually redeemed, and this too, without any de|duction for his trouble, or <HI>a&s;king for an indemnity.</HI> Can there be a &s;tronger proof than this of con&s;cious inte|grity? Or can it believed, that if he thought the matter at all doubtful, he would have voluntarily taken the ri&s;k upon him&s;elf? This &s;urely &s;hews, that he con&s;idered Mr. <HI>Dallas's pre&s;ent</HI> opinion, &s;o contrary to what it had <HI>formerly</HI> appeared to be, as not worthy of the lea&s;t re|gard, when oppo&s;ed by a conviction in his own mind of the propriety of a contrary one, and that too, &s;up|ported by opinions entitled to much more re&s;pect.</P>
<P>I have already given an an&s;wer &s;o much at length, to the objection "That the defendant did not, as he ought to have done, con&s;ult the Regi&s;ter-General or the Governor," that I &s;hall only take notice of it at pre&s;ent, for the &s;ake of drawing a well warranted con|clu&s;ion in favour of the defendant. The active, vir|tuous and di&s;cerning mind of the Regi&s;ter-General is too well known to be que&s;tioned, and it is al&s;o well known, that circum&s;tances have occurred, which leave no room for the &s;uppo&s;ition, that he has much partial|ity for the defendant; or if he had, it will not be in&s;i|nuated, that he would be &s;wayed by it on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. He tells you, Sir, as I have already ob|&s;erved, that the defendant did tell him and Mr. <HI>Gal|latin,</HI> that the old Unfunded Depreciation certificates, were redeemable under the Act of April 1792, and that on peru&s;ing it they were both of them of that opinion &mdash;He tells you, that from the certifications made to the Governor, and which pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>his</HI> office, in the ca&s;es of the old Unfunded Depreciation debt, it might, both from the amount of the intere&s;t, and the time of its commencement, be ea&s;ily known, that the certifi|cations related to that debt, and could not po&s;&s;ibly relate to any other. Thus far then, there was no want of due communication, both to the Regi&s;ter General and
<PB N="656" REF="027132_0664_0FD353FA8B4C8078">
to the Governor. It al&s;o appears, that the defendant had in his letters and reports repeatedly informed the Governor, that the New-Loan debt was &s;ub&s;cribable, and if it was &s;ub&s;cribable, no man can doubt of its being redeemable. Here then the objection again fails &mdash;But in addition to all this, the Regi&s;ter-General tells you, that <HI>after knowing of the objection made by Mr.</HI> Dallas, and after <HI>con&s;idering the law,</HI> he was of the &s;ame opinion with the defendant, and joined with him, in making &s;everal certificates to the Governor, in ca&s;es of the <HI>New-Loan debt,</HI> in order that warrants might i&s;&s;ue for its redemption at the Trea&s;ury, and that as he had no doubt at all about the law, he did not think it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;peak to the Governor on the &s;ubject&mdash;Hence it appears, that there is not the lea&s;t ground for any part of the objection&mdash;Oh! but &s;ay the gentlemen, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> defendant did not in his certifications to the Governor, in ca&s;es of the New-Loan debt, de&s;cribe it in &s;uch man|ner, as that it could be known, that the certifications re|lated to that debt." To this I an&s;wer, that the cer|tifications were exactly, as appears in evidence, agreeably to the form &s;ettled and e&s;tabli&s;hed by the different of|ficers, as proper to be ob&s;erved under the Act of April 1792, and that they did not differ, from the form made u&s;e of on other occa&s;ions; and further, that the Regi&s;|ter-General u&s;ed the &s;ame form in ca&s;es of the New-Loan debt which the defendant did.</P>
<P>But we are told that "That this bu&s;ine&s;s <HI>originated</HI> with the defendant; that he tran&s;acted it <HI>privately,</HI> and that it was unfair in him, not to inform others of the &s;ame &s;peculation!" This objection puts me in mind of a &s;tory, which I have heard related by my friend Gene|ral <HI>Wayne.</HI> Early in life, he was engaged in &s;urveying lands in <HI>Nova-Scotia.</HI> On one Sunday morning, he &s;aw a large flock of wild ducks in a pond near to his cabbin, and immediately took up his gun, in order to get a &s;hot at them.&mdash;An Indian who &s;aw the ducks, and wi&s;hed to have the <HI>&s;peculation</HI> to him&s;elf, came running to the General, and a&s;ked him, what he was going to
<PB N="657" REF="027132_0665_0FD35396009673A0">
do?&mdash;Upon the General telling him, that he intended to have a &s;hot at tho&s;e ducks, the Indian exclaimed with uplifted hands;&mdash;&s;hame! &s;hame! for you white men, to &s;hoot on the Sabbath;&mdash;we poor ignorant In|dians are not &s;o bad as you, for we would not do &s;o.&mdash; Struck with this &s;eemingly &s;erious admonition from a &s;avage, the General almo&s;t concluded to return back and lay a&s;ide his gun&mdash;While the Indian was detaining him, and endeavouring to prevail upon him to do &s;o, he heard the report of a gun, and &s;aw &s;everal of the ducks knock|ed over; upon which the Indian, leaping from the ground, and laughing very heartily, exclaimed again; &mdash;you white people think we &s;avages are fools, but you are not &s;o cunning as we are&mdash;That is my &s;quaw, who has &s;hot the ducks, and I came to keep you back, till &s;he &s;hould get the fir&s;t &s;hot!&mdash;I believe, Sir, that this is pretty much the ca&s;e with mo&s;t people, who &s;ee an opportunity for a fair &s;peculation, and that but few are &s;o &s;illy, as to cry roa&s;t beef, until they them&s;elves are &s;atisfied.&mdash; We find that Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> objected to the bill, becau&s;e it would afford an opportunity for &s;pecu|lation. It did not enumerate all the articles of re|demption, <HI>as his plan of finance did;</HI> &s;everal of the&s;e articles, might be unknown to the people at large, while they would be well known to &s;ome. This would give to a few, advantages for &s;peculation, which many would not have. This the defendant had endeavoured to prevent, but could not; and if the law left a door open for &s;peculating in the New-Loan debt, the de|fendant &s;hould at mo&s;t have been impeached for &s;pe|culating <HI>according to law!</HI> not <HI>again&s;t it.</HI></P>
<P>As a further an&s;wer to this objection, we have prov|ed, that many other people knew the &s;ame thing, and &s;peculated in the &s;ame way, and that among them, were men of unblemi&s;hed character. Upon hearing this, the gentlemen immediately &s;hift their ground and &s;ay, that "The bu&s;ine&s;s originated with the defendant, <HI>and that be led others into it,</HI> to the great injury of the com|monwealth." How is this objection reconcilable with
<PB N="658" REF="027132_0666_0FD3539786698678">
the la&s;t one? If he <HI>did the bu&s;ine&s;s privately, and did not inform others of it,</HI> how could <HI>he lead others into it?</HI> Or if he <HI>led others into it,</HI> how is it po&s;&s;ible, that he did <HI>not inform others of it?</HI>&mdash;In &s;hort, the accu&s;ers advance <HI>contrary</HI> po&s;itions, <HI>either</HI> of which if true, is a <HI>refuta|tion of the other,</HI> and yet they contend, that he is guilty on <HI>both</HI> grounds!</P>
<P>But it is not true, that the bu&s;ine&s;s originated with him, or that he led others into it. Every man who thought of the matter, judged for him&s;elf, and acted accordingly&mdash;By the evidence of Mr. <HI>Evans</HI> it appears, that he found, upon reading the law, that the New-Loan debt was redeemable. By the evidence of Mr. <HI>Boggs</HI> it appears, that he di&s;covered it in the &s;ame man|ner. Mr. <HI>Rittenhou&s;e</HI> and others al&s;o &s;ub&s;cribed the New-Loan debt and had it redeemed. They derived no information from the defendant, nor did he take a &s;ingle &s;tep to conceal any thing from them&mdash;So far was he from intending to conceal any thing, that he did the whole of the bu&s;ine&s;s <HI>in his own name,</HI> although he well knew, that at the end of the &s;econd loan, a &s;crutiny would take place, as there had at the end of the fir&s;t, and that if he had acted wrong, he would be detected, and compelled to refund. If his views were improper, how ea&s;ily might detection have been prevented, by making u&s;e of the names of others? Criminality has been imputed to him, but a deficiency of intellectual faculty has not, and yet without &s;uch deficiency, it is impo&s;&s;ible to account for his not making u&s;e of a cloak for his views, if any he had, which would have afforded ample &s;ecurity, without co&s;ting him any thing. The charge in one of the articles, <HI>that the defendant acted in the &s;ecret manner therein mentioned, in order to avoid di&s;covery and detection, until he &s;hould get the money into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,</HI> mu&s;t excite our indignation;&mdash;not again&s;t the accu&s;ed, but at the accu&s;ation. To avoid detec|tion <HI>until he &s;hould get the money into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion!</HI> He knew that at the end of the &s;econd loan a &s;crutiny

would take place, as there did at the clo&s;e of the fir&s;t; he knew that on that &s;crutiny, all certificates which were not by law &s;ub&s;cribable would be rejected; he knew that if he was acting illegally, he would on that &s;crutiny be detected, and compelled to refund with di&s;|grace what he had wrongfully received. Let me a&s;k then, Sir, if it was po&s;&s;ible for any one of the defend|ant's accu&s;ers to believe, that the paltry con&s;ideration of a temporary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the money, could have prevented him, as the article charges, from con&s;ulting the Regi&s;ter-General or communicating to the Gover|nor, <HI>until he &s;hould get the money into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion?</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible for them to have believed this, unle&s;s they al&s;o believed, that he intended to run away with the money, before the &s;crutiny &s;hould take place, at the end of the loan! His &s;ituation and circum&s;tances in life &s;ufficiently prove, that a mere temporary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the money could be no object with him, independ|ent of the di&s;grace attending the detection, which he knew mu&s;t await him, and yet as if guilt mu&s;t always be proportionate to the colouring, or the want of evi|dence may be &s;upplied by a wanton exaggeration of the charge, we find this paltry motive gravely imputed to the defendant! If I expre&s;s my&s;elf with &s;ome warmth, the occa&s;ion demands it, and I cannot be &s;o ob&s;equi|ous to the honorable accu&s;ers, as to &s;uppre&s;s my feel|ings on con&s;idering this charge.</P>
<P>But further, Sir; it is impo&s;&s;ible that when the defend|ant certified the New-Loan certificates to be genuine and a&s;&s;umable, he could have been influenced by the mo|tives imputed to him. The United States had taken no ri&s;k upon them&s;elves. A &s;crutiny was to take place at the end of the loan, when all certificates not &s;ub|&s;cribable would be rejected. Nor did <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> run any ri&s;k under the law of April 1792&mdash;That law only provided for the redemption at the Trea&s;ury, upon transfers being made to the State-Trea&s;urer for the u&s;e of the commonwealth, of the <HI>certificates which the &s;ub&s;cribers &s;hould receive from the United States, in con&s;equence of

&s;uch &s;ub&s;criptions.</HI> Had this law been ob&s;erved, no &s;ub|&s;cribed debt could have been redeemed at the Trea&s;ury of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> until the &s;ub&s;cription had been approved of by the United States, and of cour&s;e, no improper redemption could have happened&mdash;Some difficulties attended the execution of this law, and the Governor made an arrangement (page 97-98) for <HI>the redemption before the i&s;&s;uing of certificates,</HI> in con&s;equence of the &s;ub&s;cription, and of cour&s;e &s;ubjected the &s;tate to all lo&s;|&s;es ari&s;ing from any of the certificates which were de|po&s;ited with the Commi&s;&s;ioner of Loans, being forged, counterfeited or not &s;ub&s;cribable from any other cau&s;e. Although there is no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Go|vernor did not intend well, yet it mu&s;t be admitted, that this arrangement was unauthori&s;ed by law. When the defendant certified the certificates to be genuine and a&s;&s;umable, he could not know, that any &s;uch arrange|ment would be made. Without it, no payment could have been made at the Trea&s;ury, until the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury &s;hould have decided on the &s;ub&s;cribability of the certificates, and it is therefore impo&s;&s;ible, for any rational mind to &s;uppo&s;e, that the defendant could have had the motives for concealment which have been imputed to him.</P>
<P>But &s;ays the &s;ame article, "The defendant did not con&s;ult the Regi&s;ter-General touching the above tran&s;|actions, nor communicate the &s;ame to the Governor, nor di&s;criminate," &amp;c. "and thereby all the checks of office, provided by law were de&s;troyed." What were the&s;e checks of office? They were the Regi&s;ter-Gene|ral and the Governor, and no other checks were pro|vided by law.</P>
<P>If he has de&s;troyed them, he &s;hould have been in|dicted for murder;&mdash;not impeached for a mi&s;demeanor.</P>
<P>The gentleman tell us, that "The Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, on &s;eeing the law of 1789, altered his opi|nion, and determined, that the New-Loan debt was not &s;ub&s;cribable to the loan of the United States, and that he rejected it accordingly."</P>

When an objection was made on the part of <HI>Penn&s;yl|vania,</HI> the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury con&s;idered the que&s;tion on its true ground, to wit&mdash;Is the New-Loan debt a &s;till exi&s;ting debt?

This appears partly from his letter of the 8th of February and 21&s;t of Augu&s;t 1793 (page 76-7-8, and 218) but more fully from the evidence given by him in the cour&s;e of the trial.</P>

<HEAD>FIFTH AND SIXTH ARTICLES, which charge,</HEAD>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That the defendant did by him&s;elf or his agents, purcha&s;e a number of the New-Loan certificates, as well from per&s;ons who came to exchange the &s;ame at his of|fice, as from others; and</P>
<P N="2">2d. That the defendant received of &s;undry per|&s;ons, certain New-Loan certificates to be exchanged, whereby the &s;aid certificates became the property of the commonwealth, and ought to have been delivered to the Regi&s;ter-General, in order to be cancelled; yet the defendant, well knowing the &s;ame to be the property
<PB N="662" REF="027132_0670_0FD353FF26ABD378">
of the commonwealth, &s;ub&s;cribed them to the loan of the United States, in his own name and for his own u&s;e and benefit.</P>
<P>The&s;e two articles appear to me to depend on a pro|per &s;olution of the following que&s;tions.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Was it criminal in the defendant to buy New-Loan certificates out of his office, in like manner as other per&s;ons might? and,</P>
<P N="2">2d. Was it criminal to buy &s;uch as were brought to his office to be exchanged, but which the holders of them concluded not to exchange but to &s;ell?</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e que&s;tions has been very properly given up by the worthy gentleman who &s;poke la&s;t, but as his colleagues have been &s;o far from &s;hewing an e|qual degree of candour, as to warmly contend, for the affirmative of the que&s;tion, I am obliged to enter upon its di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The ground which has been taken in order to &s;hew, that it was criminal in the defendant to purcha&s;e New-Loan certificates, at <HI>any place</HI> or from <HI>any per&s;on</HI> is this &mdash;although &s;ay the gentlemen, the holders of &s;uch cer|tificates had not brought them to be exchanged, they might perhaps have done &s;o, if the defendant had not bought them, and as his buying them, may po&s;&s;ibly have prevented their being offered for exchange, it mu&s;t be criminal&mdash;and one of the gentlemen has ex|claimed&mdash;What! will the defendant's coun&s;el contend, that what is lawful for other per&s;ons is al&s;o lawful for public officers? and they have concluded by amplify|ing very much at large, on the duties of public offi|cers, in order to &s;hew that there is one law for them, and another for other people.</P>
<P>"There are," &s;ays Lord <HI>Mansfield,</HI> "&s;ome po&s;itions &s;o plain and clear in them&s;elves that nothing can make them more &s;o, and therefore one is greatly at a lo&s;s how to rea&s;on upon them." The truth of this ob&s;ervation will be admitted by every man who attempts to rea&s;on in &s;upport of a &s;elf evident propo&s;ition, &s;ince he can make u&s;e of no arguments more clear, than the pro|po&s;ition
<PB N="663" REF="027132_0671_0FD35451F4263458">
is, which they are intended to maintain. Pre|ci&s;ely in this &s;ituation do I find my&s;elf when called upon to &s;hew, that it was no le&s;s lawful for the defend|ant than for any other per&s;on, to purcha&s;e the New-Loan certificates. They were by the law of 1786 made payable to bearer, and there is no exception in that law, or in any &s;ub&s;equent law, to prevent the defend|ant or any other per&s;on from becoming the bearer. If the clau&s;e is general, no per&s;on is excepted, and it ne|ce&s;&s;arily follows, that it extends to all per&s;ons. It at all times re&s;ts with the Legi&s;lature to &s;ay, whether any particular officer &s;hall or &s;hall not bargain or deal in commodities, which may have &s;ome kind of rela|tion to his office&mdash;In &s;ome in&s;tances it is prohibited by expre&s;s provi&s;ion made for that purpo&s;e, but the&s;e in|&s;tances are but few, and until now, no man ever dream|ed that without &s;uch prohibition the dealing was un|lawful.</P>
<P>In order however to prove it to be unlawful, without any &s;uch expre&s;s prohibition, the gentlemen have &s;aid that there are ca&s;es of &s;uch prohibition and exclu&s;ion being &s;pecially made, both by the laws of <HI>Penn&s;ylva|nia</HI> and of the United States, and under the former, they have in&s;tanced vendue ma&s;ters;&mdash;under the latter, the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury.&mdash;But to me it appears, that the&s;e in&s;tances of expre&s;s prohibition, afford the fulle&s;t refutation of the doctrine, which they are quot|ed to maintain; &s;ince a &s;pecial provi&s;ion mu&s;t be en|tirely u&s;ele&s;s, if without &s;uch &s;pecial prohibition on particular officers, there is by law <HI>a general prohibition on all officers.</HI> The Legi&s;lature of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> has not thought fit to prohibit the officers of the Land-office from dealing in land, and they have done &s;o as freely as other people without any body &s;uppo&s;ing it to be un|lawful. What the law <HI>does not forbid,</HI> it <HI>permits,</HI> and where the law has not di&s;tingui&s;hed, the judges have no right to do &s;o. Without taking particular notice of the many hand&s;ome things which have been &s;aid on the duties of public officers, the&s;e duties may be &s;ummed
<PB N="664" REF="027132_0672_0FD353DC87158D88">
up in a few words to be;&mdash;<HI>to di&s;charge with fidelity, whatever the law enjoins;&mdash;to ab&s;tain from whatever it forbids.</HI> A public officer mu&s;t learn his duties from the laws of his country, and where he can find no prohi|bition in them, he has a right to &s;ay that none exi&s;ts. I have &s;aid, Sir, that one of the gentlemen has ex|claimed, What! will the defendant's coun&s;el pretend, that what is law for other per&s;ons, is al&s;o law for pub|lic officers? To this I an&s;wer, that they certainly will and boldly too, <HI>in all things</HI> where the law does not <HI>impo&s;e certain re&s;trictions,</HI> or enjoin <HI>certain duties upon them.</HI> In all other ca&s;es, the public officer and the pri|vate citizen are alike; their rights and their obligations are the &s;ame, and there is not <HI>one law for the one and another law for the other.</HI></P>
<P>Oh! but we are told, "It was indelicate in Mr. <HI>Ni|chol&s;on</HI> to be concerned in the purcha&s;ing of certifi|cates," and on this ground too, has his conviction been warmly urged. If he has not acted up to the nice no|tions of delicacy, which the accu&s;ers po&s;&s;e&s;s, they &s;hould have given us their creed of delicacy at length; they &s;hould have impeached him for indelicacy, and not for a violation of law, and in&s;tead of bringing him for trial before a tribunal bound to determine according to law, the managers &s;hould have been erected into a court of honour, to determine according to the nice feelings of your pretty, delicate gentlemen, and then per|haps, one <HI>pui&s;ne judge</HI> would have appeared to as much advantage, as he does in the character of a manager&mdash; If the defendant acted indelicately, the Governor might have di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, but in this tribunal, no European &s;y&s;tem, formed out of the fanciful reveries of delicate, vi&s;ionary men, can form the rule of deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>If Sir it was criminal in the defendant to purcha&s;e New-Loan certificates out of his office, becau&s;e the holders of them <HI>might perhaps,</HI> have brought them to his office to be exchanged, it was from the pa&s;&s;ing of the law of 1786 equally &s;o in him, to purcha&s;e Continental cer|tificates, &s;ince his office was the proper place for exchang|ing

them for New-Loans, and perhaps the holders of them might have brought them the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e for that purpo&s;e. I do not mention this as an an&s;wer to the objection, for I think it de&s;erving of none, but merely to &s;hew, that as on the &s;ame principles, the defendant has &s;ined from the beginning, his accu&s;ers may have an oppor|tunity to bring forward an additional article again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The next que&s;tion is;&mdash;Was it criminal in the de|fendant to purcha&s;e certificates brought to his office to be exchanged, but which the holders of them after|wards concluded to &s;ell.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth article &s;tates, that "The New-Loan cer|tificates by being brought to the office to be exchang|ed, and by virtue of the Act of March 1789, became the property of the commonwealth, and ought to have been delivered to the Regi&s;ter-General to be cancel|led," yet that the defendant &s;ub&s;cribed the &s;ame in his own name and to his own u&s;e, to the injury and lo&s;s of the commonwealth." If the&s;e certificates upon be|ing brought to the office to be exchanged, became the property of the commonwealth, <HI>without any exchange being made,</HI> the defendant has acted again&s;t law, but if they did not &s;o become the property of the common|wealth, this objection does not differ from the one la&s;t mentioned&mdash;Before adverting to the evidence, it will be proper to con&s;ider the law, &s;ince if it has been en|tirely mi&s;taken by the honorable accu&s;ers, this charge al&s;o, mu&s;t lo&s;e its &s;ting.</P>
<P>They &s;ay that the certificates, immediately upon be|ing brought to the officer, became the property of the commonwealth, and we &s;ay, they did not until the New-Loan certificates were delivered to the &s;tate by the holder, the balance of intere&s;t &s;ettled, that balance paid and the old Continental certificates delivered up by the &s;tate, and that until all the&s;e things were done, it was but a propo&s;al, not an exchange, and of cour&s;e there could be no change of property. That it may be &s;een which of us is right, I mu&s;t turn to the law of the 27th March 1789.</P>
<P><PB N="666" REF="027132_0674_0FD3539A073D68A8">It has already been ob&s;erved, that <HI>that</HI> Act was not compul&s;ory on the holders of New-Loan certificates, to exchange them for the old Continental ones, but that it was left at their election to do it or not, as they might think proper. Although this is a material con|&s;ideration at pre&s;ent, I will not at this time make ob|&s;ervations to prove it. It is a matter to which I have already &s;poken pretty much at large, and if my prin|ciples were &s;ound, repetition cannot be nece&s;&s;ary;&mdash;if un&s;ound it would be u&s;ele&s;s. The third &s;ection of the Act, after mentioning that "difficulties might ari&s;e in equalizing the intere&s;t paid by this &s;tate, to the holders of the New-Loan certificates, with the intere&s;t receiv|ed by this &s;tate from the United States, authori&s;ed the Pre&s;ident or Vice-Pre&s;ident in Council, to cau&s;e the New-Loan certificates, on the holders thereof apply|ing therefor, to be returned through the office of the Comptroller-General, provided that no certificates &s;hould be &s;o returned, until the intere&s;t paid by this &s;tate on the New-Loan certificates, &s;hould be equalized, and the overplus or balance, beyond what had been receiv|ed by this &s;tate from the United States, &s;hould be repaid in indents of the United States, to the Compt|roller-General, for the u&s;e of this &s;tate, and in every ca&s;e, where this &s;tate &s;hould have received more inter|e&s;t from the United States, than &s;hould have been paid on the New-Loan certificates, the Comptroller-Ge|neral &s;hould pay &s;uch overplus in indents to the hold|ers of &s;uch certificates.&mdash;After attending to this part, and on this que&s;tion it is the only material part, of the law of March 1789, it is difficult to conceive, on what principles the honorable accu&s;ers, in all their laudable zeal for accu&s;ation, could have imagined, that the New-Loan certificates became the property of the common|wealth immediately on their being offered for re-ex|change, and without any of tho&s;e requi&s;ites being com|plied with; and what mu&s;t greatly increa&s;e our wonder is, that we &s;ee their honorable managers and learned coun&s;el throwing down the gauntlet, and appearing as

Why that a holder of a New-Loan certificate, who had no other property in the world, might be told that it would be be&s;t for him to have it re-exchanged for the old Continental one.

Exchange is the act of giving and receiv|ing reciprocally; it is traffic by permutation; it is the giving of one thing for the &s;ake of another, and to talk of an exchange without a mutual transfer of property, is to mi&s;con&s;true the meaning of a word, which no &s;chool-boy is at a lo&s;s to comprehend&mdash;In a good old book of the law, in which nothing but truth is to be found, it is recorded that "In every exchange there are two grants, for that each party granteth to the other in ex|change;" and yet the defendant's accu&s;ers have di&s;|covered, that there may be an exchange, although one party parts with nothing, and although the other, does not comply with the terms on which &s;uch exchange had been propo&s;ed! I might dilate on this &s;ubject, as I might at the meridian hour of a clear day, to prove to a man of perfect vi&s;ion, that the &s;un &s;hines, but le&s;t I might become the object of ridicule, I will for|bear.

So much for the law, and now for the evidence relating to this que&s;tion.</P>
<P>It appears that &s;everal per&s;ons, who&s;e names or num|ber it would be u&s;ele&s;s to mention, withdrew their New-Loan certificates, after carrying them to the defendant's office to be exchanged. A change of mind in the hold|ers of them, was occa&s;ioned by various circum&s;tances, which have been given in evidence, and which it is needle&s;s to relate. The acquie&s;cence of the defendant in that change of mind, neverthele&s;s proves, that he thought the right of re-exchanging or not, re&s;ted with the party, until the re-exchange was completed&mdash;nor was this the opinion of him, only, but of the Gover|nor al&s;o. It is neither &s;tated in the charge nor proved by the evidence, that the holders of the certificates of|fered to be exchanged, tendered the balance of intere&s;t due from them. It is neither &s;tated nor proved that they were prepared with indents for that purpo&s;e. If this was not the ca&s;e, an exchange could not be made agreeably to the terms of the law, nor was the defend|ant authori&s;ed to make &s;uch exchange.&mdash;But &s;ay the gentlemen, when terms offered by one party, are a|greed to by the other, the bargain is compleat, and that, as the &s;tate offered to exchange the old certificates for the new ones, a change of property took place, the moment the latter were brought to the office for that purpo&s;e. I may admit the fir&s;t part of this argu|ment to be ju&s;t, without conceding the latter, &s;ince it is not true, that the &s;tate offered to exchange the old certificates for the new ones; but for the <HI>new ones and the balance of intere&s;t due from the holders of them.</HI> By a letter of the 24th of December 1791, (page 221) the defendant informed the Governor, that a number of exchanges to the amount of forty or fifty pre&s;ented, were pending for want of the parties paying the indents due, and by the &s;ame letter he mentioned, that the holders of the new certificates were, on pre&s;enting them, and liquidating the intere&s;t received thereon, entitled to receive back their former ones or an equi|valent;

no raw, unfledged &s;tripling in the paths of vice, would begin the career of villany with &s;o bold a leap!&mdash;It is not in human nature, for the human heart to become &s;o corrupt at once! It begins with little things and proceeds gradually, as it becomes more hardened, to greater ones, until it reaches that de&s;perate length when it boldly &s;purns all laws, human and divine. It &s;tarts back with horror at fir&s;t from tho&s;e crime which, when long hackneyed in iniquity it is prepared to perpetrate with eagerne&s;s. If &s;uch be the nature of the mind of man, it is almo&s;t a violation of the law of nature, to &s;uppo&s;e the defendant guilty of the crime imputed by this charge, &s;ince we do not find his mind prepared for it, by tho&s;e of a le&s;s grade&mdash;Rea&s;oning on the&s;e prin|ciples, I can &s;ee no &s;ufficient ground for the defend|ant's conviction, even if I &s;hould admit Mr. <HI>M'Clena|chan's</HI> memory to be &s;o perfect as that it could not fail him. His integrity is unque&s;tionable, and independ|ent of this charge, I believe the defendant to be equal|ly &s;o. The defendant cannot be guilty without a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|olation of his oath, and I know of no rule by which it could be determined, whether the defendant or the witne&s;s con&s;iders the obligation of an oath as more &s;a|cred. The probability is, that they hold it in equal veneration, and that no con&s;ideration could lead either of them to its violation. The defendant cannot how|ever be guilty, unle&s;s he has wilfully violated his oath; but he may be innocent, although the witne&s;s has paid the mo&s;t &s;acred regard to his. That this is the ca&s;e, I &s;hall endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h by many additional cir|cum&s;tances, tending to &s;hew, that Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan's</HI> memory has failed him. That the defendant &s;ub&s;crib|ed in his own name, and for his own u&s;e and benefit, &s;uch a certificate, as is mentioned in this charge, is not denied; but it is denied that he received it in ex|change for the u&s;e of the commonwealth. On this the whole charge depends.</P>
<P>It is peculiarly worthy of con&s;ideration, Sir, that the certificate mentioned in this charge, was &s;ub&s;cribed in
<PB N="675" REF="027132_0683_0FD35406B17A07E8">
the defendant's own name&mdash;He knew that at the end of the loan a &s;crutiny would take place; he knew that <HI>that</HI> &s;crutiny, together with &s;uch as had been &s;et on foot by the Legi&s;lature of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> would lead to his detec|tion, his di&s;grace and his puni&s;hment, if he &s;ub&s;cribed the property of the commonwealth in his own name, and for his own u&s;e and benefit; he knew that this might ea&s;ily be prevented by the &s;ub&s;cription being in &s;ome other name. The wicked flee when no man pur|&s;ueth, while the righteous is bold as a lion.&mdash;Is it then credible that the defendant, who&s;e intellectual facul|ties cannot be called in que&s;tion would, if he was a guilty man, have furni&s;hed the certain means of his conviction, when they might have been &s;o ea&s;ily pre|vented? Certainly not, and hence ari&s;es a &s;trong pre|&s;umption of his innocence.</P>
<P>If my recollection is right, Sir, the evidence af|fords another ground of defence, which mu&s;t, I think conclu&s;ively &s;hew the defendant's innocence, and the inaccuracy of Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan's</HI> recollection&mdash;There does not I think appear, to be any deficiency in the amount of New-Loan certificates, received by the &s;tate, in exchange for Continental ones. If I am right in this, and I think the contrary has not appeared in evi|dence, nothing can be more clear, than that this cer|tificate did not belong to the &s;tate, el&s;e a want of cer|tificates to a like amount, belonging to the &s;tate, mu&s;t have appeared, which I think is not the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>But the evidence of Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan,</HI> like the club of <HI>Hercules,</HI> is relied on to beat down all oppo&s;ition. It is, "That he never &s;old any certificates to the de|fendant, or exchanged any with him, in his private capacity."&mdash;The character of integrity, de&s;ervedly main|tained through life by this good man, forbids an idea of his &s;aying what he does not believe. There are oc|ca&s;ions however, in which &s;omething more than inte|grity is required, to entitle a witne&s;s to full credit. If he is in all things hurried and confu&s;ed; if his me|mory is at all times remarkably defective; if he deals
<PB N="676" REF="027132_0684_0FD35435EA12D7F0">
largely, without keeping any accounts or memoran|dum; if he &s;peaks negatively; if he relates a &s;tory, <HI>not to be believed, though told by Cato;</HI> if he &s;peaks doubtfully on many things, where accuracy and po&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tive recollection might be expected; and finally, if he appears to be mi&s;taken in other things wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re a mi&s;take is hardly po&s;&s;ible, &s;uch a man is not entitled to full credit, however good his heart may be; nor &s;hould a man of fair character be forever bla&s;ted on his evidence&punc; Let the evidence of Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> be weighed by the&s;e rules.</P>
<P>That he is a gentleman of this de&s;cription cannot be denied; that his memory is &s;o extremely defective as to di&s;able him to give an accurate account of even re|cent tran&s;actions is equally true; and that his evidence is liable to all the other objections which have been mentioned will pre&s;ently appear. Our adver&s;aries rely on his integrity, and we admit that his integrity may be relied upon, although his evidence <HI>cannot</HI>&mdash;If he really &s;old the certificate in que&s;tion to the defendant, it would be rather extraordinary if he &s;hould remem|ber it; quite natural for him to forget it. But inde|pendent of what has been &s;aid, there are many &s;trong grounds for the &s;uppo&s;ition, that he is mi&s;taken&mdash;In the fir&s;t place he &s;peaks not affirmatively but negatively, and this amounts to nothing more, than that he does not remember it, and this I can readily believe.</P>
<P>When a man of integrity &s;peaks affirmatively, we are induced to believe him, however bad his memory may be, although we mu&s;t &s;u&s;pect his relation to be inaccurate; when negatively, his evidence can amount to but little, either way.</P>
<P>That the&s;e ob&s;ervations apply with great force to the evidence of Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> will appear, when it is con&s;idered, that he dealt very largely in certificates of various kinds, for a number of years, but never kept any account or memorandum of them, becau&s;e, as he him&s;elf tells you, it was of no con&s;equence of whom he bought them, nor to whom he &s;old them&mdash;If then
<PB N="677" REF="027132_0685_0FD354092E85ED68">
he con&s;idered it as of no con&s;equence from whom they were bought, nor to whom they were &s;old; if he never kept any account or memorandum of their quantity or amount, nor of the names of the per&s;ons with whom he exchanged; from whom he bought, nor to whom he &s;old; and if he dealt in them for a number of years and to a prodigious amount, does it follow, that he did not part with this certificate to the defendant, becau&s;e he cannot recollect it? And is it not more probable, that he has forgotten, than that a man of fair character, has committed the <HI>black crime imputed to him?</HI>&mdash;He is not able to tell from whom he bought, nor to whom he &s;old other certificates, and why may not his memory have failed him with re&s;pect to this as well as to others? He does not remember from whom he bought this certifi|cate, and why &s;hould he remember to whom he fold it? He does not remember that he ever had it, and why &s;hould he remember any thing about it? He does not remember any thing about it, and how can he re|collect exchanging it with, or &s;elling it to the defend|ant! The honorable managers and learned coun&s;el very well know, that the pro&s;ecution mu&s;t fail, unle&s;s they prove, that this certificate became the property of the &s;tate, by being received in exchange from Mr. <HI>M'Cle|nachan;</HI> but his memory is &s;o treacherous, as to re|duce them to the nece&s;&s;ity of calling upon Major <HI>M'Con|cel</HI> and the State-Trea&s;urer to prove that it ever be|longed to him;&mdash;they prove this, but they prove no more, and is it to be expected, that the&s;e gentlemen &s;hould be able to prove all the tran&s;actions which ever took place between Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> and the defend|ant? <HI>It is not;</HI> and if there ever was cruelty in a pro|&s;ecution, it certainly exi&s;ts, where tho&s;e who conduct it, on finding that he who mu&s;t ones have known every thing re&s;pecting its grounds, has now forgotten them altogether, endeavour to &s;upply his defect of memory by witne&s;&s;es, who cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to know any thing which might operate in favour of the defendant. That Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> once owned this certificate is in full
<PB N="678" REF="027132_0686_0FD3540C6BA1AD80">
evidence from two gentlemen of re&s;pectable character; from him the honorable Senate can learn nothing re|&s;pecting it. Is it then extraordinary, that he who once owned this certificate, but does not recollect it; nor is able to tell from whom he received it; nor to &s;ay one word about it; &s;hould forget parting with it to the defendant? Nay, would it not be more extraordinary, if a man who does not recollect to have ever had a cer|tificate, &s;hould tell you, that he recollects parting with it to the defendant!</P>
<P>Innocence of conduct, Mr. Speaker, I have always been taught to believe, afforded ample &s;ecurity, but on the principles contended I find, if they are found, that <HI>that</HI> &s;ecurity does not depend on innocence, but on the &s;canty portion of the faculty of memory, which may have been be&s;towed on an individual.&mdash;Again, Sir, what a&s;pect will this bu&s;ine&s;s wear, if I make the extraordinary ad|mi&s;&s;ion, that Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> is remarkable for his retentive memory, and accuracy of relation; and if I go further and admit, that he never did &s;ell this cer|tificate to the defendant, nor exchange it with him in his private capacity? Not any a&s;pect unfavorable to the defendant, becau&s;e all &s;uch certificates were pay|able to bearer and transferrable by delivery. The wit|ne&s;s dealt largely in them, but does not know from whom he bought nor to whom he &s;old.&mdash;Although he does not recollect it, he received this certificate from Major <HI>M'Connel,</HI> as appears by the evidence of that gentleman. That Mr. <HI>M'Clenathan</HI> not only bought, but &s;old certificates, appears from his own te&s;timony. Whether he &s;old this certificate to &s;ome other per&s;on or not, he cannot tell, &s;ince he has forgot that he ever had it. May it not then be, that if he did not &s;ell it to the defendant, yet that he &s;old it to &s;ome other per|&s;on? And if &s;o, may it not have come fairly into the defendant's hands in the cour&s;e of his exten&s;ive deal|ings in certificates? It &s;urely may, nor can any thing be more likely. Mr. <HI>M'Clenathan</HI> was we find, in the habit of &s;elling certificates, but he cannot &s;ay to whom,
<PB N="679" REF="027132_0687_0FD354553664E570">
or this certificate might perhaps be ea&s;ily traced to the defendant's hands. If he cannot &s;ay to whom he &s;old, why are we to expect that the defendant can prove, from whom he bought? Becau&s;e &s;ay his accu&s;ers, "He is an accurate man."&mdash;That he is an accurate man, in matters wherein accuracy is required, or can be u&s;eful, is admitted; but what occa&s;ion could there be for ac|curacy in keeping an account of the names of per&s;ons, from whom he bought, or to whom he &s;old certifi|cates? Or how could it be u&s;eful? Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> &s;ays, he kept no &s;uch account, becau&s;e it was of no con&s;e|quence. Mo&s;t other people rea&s;oned I believe in the &s;ame way, and I very much doubt, if many in&s;tances can be &s;hewn, of &s;uch accounts being kept by dealers in certificates. Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> was a&s;ked if he could tell the names of all the per&s;ons from whom he bought, and to whom he &s;old certificates, but he deemed the que&s;tion &s;o unrea&s;onable, that he refu&s;ed to an&s;wer it, and yet the guilt of the defendant is &s;trongly urged, becau&s;e he cannot prove from whom he got this certi|ficate. On the &s;ame principles might he be called on to prove, from whom he received every certificate, of every kind and de&s;cription which he ever owned; on the &s;ame principle it might be concluded, that where-ever he could not furni&s;h &s;uch proof, he had &s;tolen them; and on the &s;ame principle, might the &s;ame con|clu&s;ion be made again&s;t every other man under the like circum&s;tances! But &s;ay the gentlemen, the defendant kept a diary of all his tran&s;actions, and if he had bought this certificate, an account of it would appear in that diary. Sir that diary lies on the table, and if the gen|tlemen will permit it to be read, it will be found, that it does not contain an account <HI>of all his tran&s;actions,</HI> nor of any &s;ingle tran&s;action of any kind whatever, except of the public bu&s;ine&s;s of his office, tran&s;acted by him for other people as Comptroller-General. If the gentlemen will permit the diary to be read, they will find this to be the ca&s;e, and if they will not, its contents &s;hould not be mi&s;repre&s;ented. The defendant thought it of no
<PB N="680" REF="027132_0688_0FD3282391A1AFE8">
more con&s;equence than Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> did from whom he bought, nor to whom he &s;old certificates, nor <HI>did he ever keep any accounts thereof</HI>&mdash;On the &s;ame ground, then, might he be impeached on account of every other certificate &s;ub&s;cribed by him, and which had been i&s;|&s;ued in any other name than his own; on the &s;ame ground, might all other per&s;ons, under the like cir|cum&s;tances be impeached; on the &s;ame principles might their guilt be pre&s;umed. This doctrine would al&s;o ex|tend to Continental certificates, &s;ub&s;cribed under the fir&s;t loan, &s;ince with equal propriety it might be urged, that the &s;tate had received them in exchange for New-Loan certificates, as it is now urged that this New-Loan certificate was received in exchange for a Conti|nental one. I believe I have already ob&s;erved, that a &s;trong pre&s;umption of innocence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ri&s;es, from the de|fendant having &s;ub&s;cribed this certificate in his own name, &s;ince he mu&s;t have known, that if he had pil|fered it from the &s;tate, a deficiency in the New-Loan certificates to the &s;ame amount would appear, and al&s;o, that he had &s;ub&s;cribed this certificate, the property of the &s;tate, in his own name and for his own u&s;e. But few men, when in the commi&s;&s;ion of crimes, are &s;o carele&s;s of con&s;equences, as not to take &s;ome pains to avoid detection; none &s;o &s;illy, as to furni&s;h evidence again&s;t them&s;elves&mdash;The defendant, if he be really guilty, forms a &s;trange exception to the rule, &s;ince he might have avoided detection, by &s;ub&s;cribing in the name of &s;ome other per&s;on, or fixing on other certifi|cates, received from per&s;ons who are &s;ince dead, or from &s;trangers who could not now appear again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The great doubt with which Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> an|&s;wered many of the interrogatories, his total forget|fulne&s;s of &s;everal things, which he mu&s;t once have known, and which are of &s;uch a nature, as to be not ea&s;ily forgotten, and his own account of his manner of tran&s;acting bu&s;ine&s;s relating to certificates, will be&s;t &s;hew, how far his memory is to be relied on, when &s;peaking negatively.</P>

Was &s;uch a carele&s;&s;ne&s;s in bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;uch an indifference about property ever manife&s;ted by mortal! (vide page 26) and is the negative te&s;ti|mony of &s;uch a witne&s;s after a long lap&s;e of time, &s;uf|ficient to prove that a thing did not happen becau&s;e he does not remember it? He tells you that it is probable that he had a certificate of that amount, but he cannot be certain thereof&mdash;If he cannot be certain, that he had it, he cannot be certain that he gave it to the de|fendant to be exchanged, and if he does not know, nor pretend to &s;ay this, how can the honorable Senate learn it from him? It is not in proof that he ever had the certificate after March 1790, and if &s;o, it cannot be in proof that at a period long after, he delivered it to the defendant to be exchanged. He was in the habit of &s;elling certificates; but what certificates or to what amount or to whom he cannot now inform you, and why may not he have &s;old this as well as others?</P>
<P>When called on to give an account of his tran&s;acti|ons with <HI>Matthew M'Connell,</HI> he &s;ays, that he never, to the be&s;t of his knowledge, either &s;old or lent to, or depo&s;ited with <HI>Matthew M'Connell</HI> a certificate to the amount of &pound;. 3275:19:4 and that as he did not lend him &s;uch a certificate he could not receive it from him in return.</P>
<P>This is not &s;aying it is true, that he never received one from him to that amount, but when called upon to relate, what had pa&s;&s;ed between them in their deal|ings in certificates, it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e, that a man of Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan's</HI> fair character, would have played upon words in this manner, or endeavoured to conceal the truth, if he had remembered receiving &s;uch a certificate from Mr. <HI>M'Connell,</HI> and yet, that he did receive &s;uch a certificate from him on the 23d of April

1788 is proved by that gentleman and by his books. Here then is full evidence of Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI>'s me|mory failing him, as to the buying of this very certi|ficate from one gentleman, and is it more extraordinary for him to forget the &s;elling of it to another?</P>
<P>He &s;ays Sir, that he lent Mr. <HI>M'Connell</HI> a number of <HI>&s;mall</HI> certificates, amounting in the whole to upwards of &pound;. 3000&mdash;and that he made a memorandum of them in a book. This entry of them in the book was, becau&s;e they were to be returned&mdash;It has &s;ince been produced, and among the&s;e <HI>&s;mall</HI> certificates we find, be&s;ides &s;e|veral to a larger amount than &pound;. 200 each, one to the a|mount of &pound;. 328:9:9 another to the amount of &pound;. 398:8:9 and another to the amount of &pound; 1350:0:0&mdash;Sure|ly the witne&s;s would not have called the la&s;t one, a <HI>&s;mall</HI> certificate, if he had recollected it. He mu&s;t there|fore have forgotten, notwith&s;tanding the entry made in his book. Had it not been for that entry, it is proba|ble, that the whole tran&s;action would have forgot|ten, and that his memory, though aided by it before giving his evidence, was &s;o extremely treacherous as to fail him, when giving it without having the books be|fore his eyes at the very moment of doing &s;o. Here he &s;peaks <HI>affirmatively,</HI> that they were all &s;mall. He is mi&s;taken, and why not &s;o, when &s;peaking negative|ly, and without the help of a memorandum to refre&s;h his memory? Another very extraordinary circum|&s;tance attending the evidence of this gentleman is, that although from the help of his memorandum, he is enabled to recollect, lending to Mr. <HI>M'Connell</HI> on the 30th of March 1789, certificates amounting in the whole to upwards of &pound;. 3000&mdash;yet when called upon to give an account of all their dealings in certificates, he mentions no others (page 251) although Major <HI>M'Connell,</HI> when a&s;ked whether, the certificates for &pound;. 3275:19:4 was paid or &s;old to Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan;</HI> tells you, "That it was delivered to him agreeably to an engagement or contract. That Mr. <HI>M'Clena|chan</HI> delivered him &s;ome certificates, for which he was
<PB N="683" REF="027132_0691_0FD3540EB8372CA0">
to deliver him a certain quantity of another kind, and that he delivered him more certificates be&s;ides this at the time alluded to, and afterwards." This tran&s;action happened in April 1788, (page 250) and it cannot therefore be the &s;ame with that which Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan's</HI> entry enables him to recollect having happened (page 254) in March 1789. It proves that Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> parted with certificates to Major <HI>M'Connell</HI> be&s;ides the&s;e mentioned by him to more than the amount of &pound;. 3275:19:4 and that in April 1788, he was partly repaid by one certificate to that amount, and partly by more certificates at the &s;ame time, and fully by more certifi|cates afterwards&mdash;yet every trace of this tran&s;action is entirely era&s;ed from the memory of the witne&s;s&mdash;Im|pre&s;&s;ions made on his mind by objects of di&s;tre&s;s, or a &s;en&s;e of religious or moral duty are la&s;ting; all others are but momentary, and like a bird in the air leave not a trace behind.</P>
<P>If this is not &s;ufficient to prove, that no other con|clu&s;ion is to be drawn from Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan's</HI> not be|ing able to recollect a fact, than that he has forgotten it; demon&s;tration of its truth will afforded by that which is to follow&mdash;The whole amount of certificates which he mentions, as having been receive by him from Major <HI>M'Connell</HI> is upwards of &pound;. 3000, which was returned to him in con&s;equence of the loan of March 1789&mdash;I have already &s;hewed, that be&s;ides that &s;um, he received from him to more than the amount of &pound;. 3275:19:4. Let us now attend to the evidence of Major <HI>M'Connell,</HI> &s;upported by an accurate li&s;t made at the time, and furni&s;hed from his books&mdash;It amounts to no le&s;s a &s;um (page 191) than &pound;. 16035:11:5 in certificates delivered by him to Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan!</HI> It follows that the &s;um of &pound;. 13000 or thereabouts has e&s;caped the witne&s;s' memory, be&s;ides much more than &pound;. 3000 parted with by him to Major <HI>M'Connell</HI> in A|pril 1788!</P>

<P>In &s;hort, Sir. notwith&s;tanding the large dealings in the certificate bu&s;ine&s;s, which took place between the witne&s;s and Major <HI>M'Connell,</HI> the mind of the former is a mere blank, except where his memorandum made an impre&s;&s;ion, but even that impre&s;&s;ion was &s;o fugitive, as to be gone, the moment the book was out of his hands!</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, Sir, that he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf on many occa&s;ions, as to be &s;ure an hone&s;t man who doubts would do, with &s;o much he&s;itation as to &s;hew, that he is certain of nothing. His an&s;wers afford ample te&s;|timony of this, and I need not go through them to prove it. It has been objected, that as Mr. <HI>M'Clena|chan</HI> tells you, "He took all the New-Loan certifi|cates that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and which were to a very con&s;i|derable amount, to be exchanged." This mu&s;t have been among&s;t them. To this I an&s;wer, that this evi|dence can only apply to the certificates which he then had, not tho&s;e which he had parted with, and of cour&s;e it proves nothing at all, &s;ince it does not appear that he then had the certificate in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>"I took no account," &s;ays Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan,</HI> "of either the number or value of the certificates, nor of the rime of delivering them to be exchanged." How little mu&s;t he then know re&s;pecting them!</P>
<P>Whether the certificate in que&s;tion was exchanged or not, or whether the witne&s;s received Continental ones in lieu thereof, he cannot tell (page 255-6.)</P>
<P>Whether he received Continental certificates in ex|change for his New-Loan ones altogether and at one time, or at different times he does not remember (page 256)</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> obliged Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> at his re|que&s;t at different times with indents, but to what amount the witne&s;s cannot &s;ay (page 257.)</P>

<P>I might perhaps Mr. Speaker, with great &s;afety to my client, clo&s;e my ob&s;ervations here, but I &s;till re&s;t on one &s;trong ground of defence, &s;urrounded by im|pregnable ramparts of truth and &s;afety, from which it will never be in the power of the well organized and arranged, the well trained and di&s;ciplined band of ve|teran a&s;&s;ailants to di&s;place me. The charge is, that this certificate had been received in exchange for an|other one, and it thereby became the property of the &s;tate&mdash;If this is not proved, there is no evidence of the defendant's guilt and he mu&s;t be acquitted. It is not incumbent on him to prove, than it was not the pro|perty of the &s;tate, but on the &s;tate it is incumbent to prove, that it was. What is the proof which the &s;tate afford of this? Why that in March 1790 it was owned by Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan,</HI> and that at a &s;ub&s;equent period, he cannot tell us when, he delivered all the certificates which he then had, without being able to mention their amount or number to the defendant to be exchanged; that he received in exchange, certain others, the amount or number of which he cannot tell; nor did he ever know, whether the certificate in que&s;tion was among them or not;&mdash;he cannot &s;ay nor does be know that he ever &s;aw it. Although we cannot learn it from him, we learn from others, that he owned it in March 1790, but as he was in the practice of buying and &s;elling cer|tificates, upon a very large and exten&s;ive &s;cale, with|out keeping any accounts whatever re&s;pecting them, he may have parted with this certificate, in April, May or June of the &s;ame year. Upon whom then does the burthen of the proof lie? The pro&s;ecutors tell us that when &s;tolen goods are found upon a man, he can only be acquitted, by proving that he came hone&s;tly by them, and they have endeavoured to apply that pri|nciple to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. The principle is certainly a

good one, but before it can be applied, it mu&s;t ap|pear, that the goods were &s;tolen&mdash;Before an enquiry re&s;pecting the thief can take place, it is nece&s;&s;ary to prove that a felony was committed, and until that ap|pears, the party accu&s;ed may &s;afely remain &s;ilent&mdash;So here; until it is proved that this certificate became the property of the &s;tate by being received in exchange, the defendant is under no nece&s;&s;ity of proving that he did not purloin it from the &s;tate. If it never belonged to the &s;tate, it is impo&s;&s;ible for the &s;tate to be defraud|ed by its ab&s;traction. It is therefore incumbent on the &s;tate before this charge can be maintained, to e&s;tabli&s;h a property in this certificate. Of this, though e&s;&s;en|tial to a conviction, and without which it is impo&s;&s;ible where truth and law prevail, for a conviction to take place, not a particle of proof has been offered&mdash;It has only been &s;hewn that Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan</HI> owned it in March 1790, and that more than two years afterwards he delivered all the certificates which he then had, to the defendant to be exchanged;&mdash;but as he had been in the habit of &s;elling certificates, and knows nothing at all about this, there is no more evidence, of his having parted with it to the &s;tate, than to any private individual whatever. Unle&s;s this ground is &s;upported by evidence, the pro&s;ecution mu&s;t fail, but in &s;upport of this ground there is no evidence.&mdash;Evidence in &s;up|port of its truth mu&s;t be home again&s;t the defendant, or he has a right to demand an acquittal&mdash;The evid|ence adduced for that purpo&s;e, is in the language of an antient orator, no le&s;s feeble than would be an at|tempt to put but the &s;un, by fanning in his face with a peacock's feather.&mdash;Here then, Sir, permit me to pau&s;e and to make a &s;erious and determined &s;tand;&mdash;a &s;tand on ground &s;o &s;ure and &s;olid as to afford perfect &s;afety wherever evidence is attended to;&mdash;truth re&s;pected; law regarded or innocence pre&s;umed until guilt appears.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, Sir, in an early &s;tage of my remarks, that to a conviction on a charge of perjury, the evidence of two witne&s;&s;es is required. The law is the &s;ame on a

I only reque&s;t that they may be remembered, and that it may be &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered, whether the &s;ame principle is not applica|ble on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.&mdash;The con&s;equence of a conviction will be a removal from office;&mdash;it may be a "di&s;qualification to hold any office of honour, tru&s;t or profit under this commonwealth." Of this I &s;hould not have taken any notice, had not the &s;uppo&s;ed mild|ne&s;s of the puni&s;hment, been &s;trongly urged as a rea|&s;on for conviction.&mdash;Let your men of <HI>delicacy,</HI> who urge a conviction, becau&s;e to their <HI>delicate</HI> feelings it appears, that the defendant has not acted delicately &s;ay whether to a man of honour &s;uch a puni&s;hment is not wor&s;e than death!</P>

<P>Circum&s;tances, of which my pre&s;ent appearance, af|fords too ample a proof, have entitled me to &s;ome in|dulgence, but I have received it in &s;uch a degree, that I will not abu&s;e it by taking up time in a recapitulation.</P>

<P><HI>Mr.</HI> INGERSOLL <HI>&s;poke as follows</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Senate,</HI></P>
<P>THE honorable but arduous ta&s;k of concluding the arguments falls to my lot. I have to lament the di&s;|parity between my abilities and the magnitude of this bu&s;ine&s;s; the latter circum&s;tance I doubt not however will &s;ecure me your be&s;t attention.</P>
<P><PB N="689" REF="027132_0697_0FD354C2CA7AE450">There are circum&s;tances in this <HI>cau&s;e</HI> &s;ufficient to excite the curio&s;ity of the mo&s;t dull, and to affect the feelings of tho&s;e lea&s;t attentive to the intere&s;t of the community.</P>
<P>More than 60,000 dollars have been i&s;&s;ued from your Trea&s;ury, in &s;tock of the United States. The expect|ed compen&s;ation cannot be obtained; and if it could, it would be on terms that would render the acqui&s;ition, no gain; and the Comptroller-General, your confiden|tial agent, has gained more than &pound;. 5000 by the tran&s;|action.</P>
<P>A tran&s;action &s;o injurious to the commonwealth and derogatory to the character of the defendant, requires a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. The reputation of the &s;tate, and cha|racter of the defendant, are implicated in this inve&s;ti|gation; the enquiry is of great importance, as it re|&s;pects the defendant, or the conduct of the A&s;&s;embly. If the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives made u&s;e of expre&s;&s;i|ons authori&s;ing what has been done, let their intention have been what it might, the fault is imputable to them <HI>alone.</HI> It is nece&s;&s;ary, the import of their language &s;hould known; or, if the Comptroller-General ma|naged his official duty with art and de&s;ign, and mi&s;|con&s;trued laws to &s;erve his private emolument, he ought to be the object of public di&s;approbation.</P>
<P>Whether, therefore, you con&s;ider the defendant, or the nature of the &s;ubject, no place can be &s;o proper for the inve&s;tigation as the Senate, ina&s;much as character and &s;tation can have no weight before this high tribu|nal. The re&s;ult of experience induced our ance&s;tors, in another country, to prefer trials by impeachments to the ordinary tribunals, to prevent a defect of ju&s;|tice, as the influence of the accu&s;ed often bias and &s;way the minds of a jury. Some pains have been taken by the coun&s;el for the defendant to prejudice the Senate again&s;t this mode of proceeding. They &s;ay this ought to be referred to courts of ju&s;tice! One gentleman &s;aid, "popular bodies are ea&s;ily warped by an artful indi|vidual, when he meditates the ruin of his neighbour."
<PB N="690" REF="027132_0698_0FD3545BFAFC6B08">
And the gentleman who &s;poke la&s;t attributes it to a gratification of humour.</P>
<P>I do not recollect in <HI>England</HI> any abu&s;e of this pro|ce&s;s; a &s;alutary u&s;e hath been made of it in this coun|try. In the United States, and in the different &s;tates, we find, when they reject bills of attainder, they adopt the mode of trials by impeachment.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume every Senator hearing me perfectly under|&s;tands the different kinds of debts.</P>
<P>Funded debt includes certificates i&s;&s;ued for &s;ervices or &s;upplies on Continental account, not including De|preciation certificates i&s;&s;ued for the depreciation of the pay of the <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> line. The Act of the 21&s;t of March 1783 makes the di&s;tinction between <HI>funded</HI> and <HI>unfunded</HI> depreciation certificates. When the depre|ciation certificates were originally i&s;&s;ued, they were only funded in the Land-office, and on forfeited e&s;tates; the&s;e funds were found in&s;ufficient to keep them from depreciating; the exci&s;e was therefore per Act la&s;t al|luded to, appropriated to tho&s;e not alienated. Hence the di&s;tinction. Now, the unfunded debt is an object of our enquiry. This debt, &s;trictly &s;peaking, originat|ed lately, had been i&s;&s;ued on Continental account, and unconnected with this cau&s;e, being contracted between the individuals and the &s;tate; and although contracted on Continental account, they were &s;tate debts; the creditors had no other debtor but the &s;tate, and being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of 3 per cent. &s;tock of the United States &s;uf|ficient to redeem and pay off this debt, the law of the 10th of April 1792, who&s;e meaning we are endeavour|ing to a&s;certain, was pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>It may al&s;o be proper here to mention that the a|mount of the New-Loans was about five millions of dollars, that &pound;. 118,470:6:6 had been redeemed, and that the remainder had been reduced by exchanges to the &s;um of &pound;. 50,000. and no doubt had been enter|tained but that the whole would be exchanged without the expence of a &s;ingle farthing to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t great que&s;tion of the cau&s;e now offered for
<PB N="691" REF="027132_0699_0FD354C140488A50">
con&s;ideration: What debts were redeemable under the Act of the 10th of April 1792?</P>
<P>I an&s;wer in the words of the law, 1&s;t. Certificates on which an intere&s;t of 6 per cent. was payable annu|ally: 2d. 6 per cent. purparts. 3d. 3 per cent. pur|parts; and, 4th. Dollar-money. As matter of explana|tion I mu&s;t here imitate the example of the coun&s;el for the defendant, by referring to the Journals to a&s;certain the law. (Mr. <HI>Inger&s;oll</HI> then read the report of the committee of ways and means of the 22d of February 1792, page 157, in which the debts to be redeemed are &s;tated; and that tho&s;e under the &s;ixth &s;ection were only to be redeemed on condition Congre&s;s &s;hould again open the loan. Mr. <HI>Inger&s;oll</HI> al&s;o enumerated the cer|tificates on which the &s;tate were paying intere&s;t; that New-Loans were none of tho&s;e mentioned in that &s;ec|tion, which was contrary to the defendant's po&s;ition, page 161. The committee contemplate the event of opening the loan, and declare on what grounds they will place unfunded depreciation. In page 160 the amount of the debt &s;ub&s;cribable is carried out &pound;.73,935 3:2. Mr. <HI>Inger&s;oll</HI> then read the report of the Compt|roller-General of the 30th November 1791; in which he mentioned the debt which was entitled to purparts, and which excludes Unfunded Depreciation and New-Loan certificates; and ob&s;erved that it was clear that the committee of ways and means did not con&s;ider the New-Loans as a &s;tate debt, and they did not forget all the debts, for they enumerated the &s;everal kinds.)</P>
<P>In page 188 of the &s;ame minutes the report was read the &s;econd time, and no alteration was made. The &s;ame idea is pre&s;erved in the Act as it is in the report. It is apparent the Legi&s;lature did not contemplate New-Loans as a &s;ub&s;i&s;ting debt. I will only refer to the rules for con&s;truing and expounding &s;tatutes. It is a maxim in the con&s;truction, <HI>haeret in litera, haeret in cortice,</HI> that the life of a &s;tatute does not con&s;i&s;t in the words but in the &s;en&s;e and meaning of it; that general words of &s;tatutes &s;hall receive a particular interpreta|tion

when the intent of the maker is particular; that things out of the letter may be within the intent, and things within the letter may be without the intent; that the intent is to be collected &s;ometimes; by con&s;idering the cau&s;e of making the Act, &s;ometimes by compar|ing one part of the Act with the other, and &s;ometimes by foreign circum&s;tances. General words in an Act are not to be, con&s;trued to extend to what is repealed or annulled by previous Acts, &s;uch con&s;tructions ought al|ways to be made, that one part of the Act may agree with another: Finally, an Act of Parliament as a la&s;t will is to be con&s;trued by the intention of the maker, that one part of it is to expound and explain the other.</P>
<P>I will &s;hew that all their arguments refer back to a literal meaning, and that it is, as improbable that the &s;ick &s;ailor mentioned in 1&s;t volume of <HI>Black&s;tone,</HI> (page 61) &s;hould be entitled to the property as that the New-Loan certificates &s;hould be within the provi&s;ion of the law of the 10th April 1792. It is univer&s;ally acknow|ledged that the &s;hip and lading did not in the la&s;t in|&s;tance belong to the &s;ick pa&s;&s;enger, nor could it be within the meaning of the &s;tatute. So we &s;ay in this ca&s;e, the New-Loans could not be within the purview of the Act, &s;o that they mu&s;t be eventually paid. The idea was never &s;ugge&s;ted that intere&s;t mu&s;t have been paid at the Trea&s;ury on five millions of dollars, of which there remained about fifty thou&s;and pounds unexchang|ed. No man entertained a doubt but that the whole &s;um &s;hould have been exchanged in a &s;hort time. Why then &s;hould an expence of 20 or 25 per cent. be in|curred, when the whole might be exchanged and in a very little time no New-Loans would be remaining?</P>
<P>It hath been &s;tated by Mr. <HI>Morgan,</HI> that if the Act was to have been con&s;trued literally, <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> would have to redeem all the debts of the &s;everal States in the Union. True; but does not this &s;hew that a literal con&s;truction is inadmi&s;&s;ible, for then the debt of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> not owing on continental account would
<PB N="693" REF="027132_0701_0FD354A590796C28">
be al&s;o redeemable. This &s;hews the words <HI>State debt</HI> were u&s;ed in an appropriate, &amp; not a general &s;en&s;e. How then are the New-Loan certificates noticed? Is there a law or re&s;olution of the General A&s;&s;embly? Is there a report of the Committees of ways or means? Is there an addre&s;s from the Governor to the Legi&s;lature? Is there a report from the Comptroller-General him&s;elf, recogniz|ing them as a debt or giving any intimation that the State meant to redeem them, from the pa&s;&s;ing of the Act of March 1789 to the pa&s;&s;ing of the Act of 10th April 1792? If therefore the Legi&s;lature had received no ac|count for three years of the &s;tate of the exchanges on what proportion of them were out: When, then, the whole &s;y&s;tem is changed, without a line written or a word &s;poken on the &s;ubject by the Comptroller or Regi&s;ter-General, the whole bu&s;ine&s;s being unknown to the A&s;&s;embly, what have they done?</P>
<P>Thus far we agree, that on the 27th of March 1789 the Legi&s;lature declared, &s;aying, we will not pay the New-Loan certificates, we will return the continental ones, you mu&s;t look to Congre&s;s for your pay. The Legi&s;lature of 1789 made this declaration, when did they declare a different &s;entiment? Why, Sir, the coun|&s;el for the defendant allege, that all on a &s;udden with|out a &s;ingle word &s;aid or written about it, on the 10th of April 1792, the Legi&s;lature provided a fund commen|&s;urate with the objects to be redeemed? Is it to be &s;up|po&s;ed that they would extend the redemption without <HI>enlarging</HI> the fund? Would they abandon their prudent plan to open their arms &s;o wide as to embrace even old Continental bills of credit, and this even without being furni&s;hed with an e&s;timate of the co&s;t?&mdash;(Mr. <HI>Inger&s;oll</HI> then read the 2d &s;ection of the Act of 10th of April.)</P>
<P>As it appears the fir&s;t leading motive with the Legi&s;la|ture was to get rid of their debts, what rea&s;on can be given why we &s;hould not pur&s;ue the &s;ame idea thro', and apply the &s;ame motives? The Legi&s;lature did not undertake to redeem all that are &s;ub&s;cribable&mdash;In the law of the 9th April 1791 the State debts are a&s;&s;umable, altho' not re|deemable,
<PB N="694" REF="027132_0702_0FD354D9363ADFA0">
the unfunded debt is mentioned by the com|mittee on ways and means as &s;ub&s;cribable, altho' not redeemable, and it is payable at 20&shilling;. in the pound, while its only receivable at 16&shilling;.;&mdash;Their only intent was to compel a &s;ub&s;cription of the debt they meant to re|deem, and therefore they impo&s;ed it on the holders as a con&s;ideration, that they &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe. Therefore if our con&s;truction is adopted, the &s;y&s;tem is complete and con&s;i&s;tent; if on the other hand the defendant's con|&s;truction &s;hould prevail, there is a fund in one, and none in the other. Here was a condition impo&s;ed as nece&s;&s;a|ry to a redemption, you &s;hall &s;ub&s;cribe to the loan, and a&s;&s;ign to the &s;tate trea&s;urer for the u&s;e of the common|wealth; the legi&s;lature pre&s;uming that they had provid|ed a fund, directed an order to be drawn by the Gover|nor on the Trea&s;urer who &s;hall immediately pay, &amp;c.&mdash;</P>
<P>Con&s;ider for a moment the con&s;equences. If the New-Loans were included, the amount indefinite, what a predicament would the Legi&s;lature be involved in. Their plea is extravagant, their only re&s;ource is the fund for claims and improvements, this fund was re|&s;tricted to &pound;. 10,000 and &pound;. 5000 of that were annually appropriated for the improvement of roads. They have therefore put a con&s;truction on this act that would di&s;honor the State, di&s;honor the fir&s;t Magi&s;trate; the con&s;equences of redeeming the New-Loans without providing funds would manife&s;t the extreme ignorance and incon&s;ideration of the Legi&s;lature&mdash;Why adopt a con&s;truction who&s;e con&s;equences are &s;o ab&s;urd, &s;o ex|travagant? They &s;ay, the State &s;hall redeem whatever Congre&s;s will a&s;&s;ume, &s;hall Congre&s;s a&s;&s;ume, becau&s;e the &s;tate will redeem? Does Congre&s;s a&s;&s;ume the debts, which the &s;tate will not pay? <HI>They will not.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot be pretended that the redemption law of the 10th of April, 1792, created a debt; the New-Loans were excluded from redemption by the Act of 27th March 1789, there the Legi&s;lature declare the New-Loans &s;hall never be redeemed by us; we will not redeem them otherwi&s;e than by an exchange; does
<PB N="695" REF="027132_0703_0FD354DB9FF993D0">
Congre&s;s &s;ay, they will a&s;&s;ume, what <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> &s;ays, &s;he will not redeem. If the New-Loans are not redeem|able by the State, they are not a&s;&s;umable by Congre&s;s. Their con&s;truction will not do, except they can &s;hew the will of the Legi&s;lature fully expre&s;&s;ed &s;ince the 27th of March 1789; at that time no divi&s;ions of parties prevailed, as they did when the Act of the 10th April, 1792, was pa&s;&s;ed. Is it to be imagined, that they would leave it to Congre&s;s to &s;ay, what debts <HI>Penn&s;yl|vania</HI> was to pay?</P>
<P>No, Mr. Speaker, we are to take it upon the exi&s;ting acts; from the complexion of the hou&s;e at that time, it is pre&s;umed that they would not throw them&s;elves into the power of Congre&s;s. In the official &s;tatements of the Comptroller-General to the Legi&s;lature, in which he included all the debts of the commonwealth, he expre&s;sly &s;tates the&s;e New-Loans as excluded by law from redemption. I confe&s;s, I thought the&s;e few ob&s;er|vations would have been &s;ufficient for minds open to conviction, in as much as all parties acquie&s;ced in the Act of 1789, no objections were made to it, nor were any difficulties &s;tarted; all parties concurred, when the &s;tate had declared her will, and none referred to the New-Loans&mdash;&s;trange, to hear curious di&s;putes about the con&s;titution,&mdash;for in Augu&s;t the &s;ame year the cre|ditors applied to Congre&s;s as to their only hope. As much pains have been taken to ob&s;cure what is in it|&s;elf plain and &s;elf-evident, and left I &s;hould be thought to have neglected my duty, I am obliged to be more particular, I will therefore proceed to &s;hew&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>Twenty &s;econd day of the trial. <HI>MONDAY, MARCH 24.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Mr. INGERSOLL, in continuation.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Senate,</HI></P>
<P>MY <HI>fir&s;t po&s;ition is, that the New-Loan certificates were not a&s;&s;umable;</HI> and it is worthy of attention to con&s;ider the manner in which it hath been brought be|fore the Senate. The Comptroller-General, a principal officer of government is endeavouring to bring forward a law con&s;igned to everla&s;ting oblivion; to a&s;&s;i&s;t his views, he is trying to give a con&s;truction to the Act of 10th of April, 1792, a con&s;truction which did not pre|vail at that time, and it is but of late that the di&s;covery was made.</P>
<P>If laws are to be con&s;trued in this manner the be&s;t plan may be rendered abortive; but it hath been &s;hewn that the Legi&s;lature have left on their records an indu|bitable evidence that they con&s;idered the Act of 1789 as perfectly annihilating the certificates in que&s;tion. They bore an intere&s;t of 6 per cent. for four years, if they were State debts they mu&s;t have borne intere&s;t until paid off; why then were they omitted in the enu|meration of the debts of the &s;tate? Why were they omitted in the &s;ixth &s;ection if they were &s;ub&s;cribable as a debt of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania?</HI> Would it then be contended as an operation of the law, or was this inferrable from the Comptroller-General's report of December 1790&mdash; Wherein he adds that he was then &s;tating all the debts of the commonwealth on which intere&s;t was payable by the &s;tate, and adds 600l. intere&s;t on the New-Loans being a part of the four year's intere&s;t&mdash;That the Compt|roller-General is wrong, it is &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that if
<PB N="698" REF="027132_0706_0FD354C5CBA8D148">
they are a&s;&s;umable they mu&s;t be within the a&s;&s;umption of Congre&s;s. If I can &s;atisfy the Senate that the&s;e debts are not within the a&s;&s;umption of Congre&s;s, if &s;o, and the Comptroller is defeated, is it a &s;ufficient apology for him to &s;ay? <HI>"Such was my opinion. I was mi&s;taken."</HI> A public officer ought to tread on &s;ure ground; gro&s;s negligence and inattention is fraud; extravagant ra&s;h|ne&s;s ought to be checked in any well regulated com|monwealth.</P>
<P>Although it is his fault then if it &s;hall pa&s;s unnoticed now, the blame will re&s;t el&s;ewhere. How does it ap|pear; is it not clear proof that they are not a&s;&s;umable? The Secretary of the Trea&s;ury hath declared to the world they are not a&s;&s;umable, the commi&s;&s;ioners for &s;ettling the accounts of the United States with the in|dividual States, have declared the &s;ame opinion, be|cau&s;e the New-Loans are not charged to Congre&s;s in the account of this State, therefore not con&s;idered as certificates i&s;&s;ued for &s;ervices or &s;upplies, <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> cannot obtain certificates from Congre&s;s, if &s;he could, &s;he mu&s;t refund the amount in continental certificates, and pay the &s;ame in addition; the United States do not undertake to a&s;&s;ume and charge the &s;tate with debts, which they have refu&s;ed to pay. The Attorney-General of the United States declared them not a&s;&s;umable, but that firm texture of mind which one of the coun&s;el for the defendant hath attributed to him is hardly a &s;uffi|cient apology. If this had taken place, the whole &s;ub|&s;cription would have been lo&s;t to the &s;tate, I will &s;hew this to mathematical demon&s;tration. The amount of the &s;ub&s;cription of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> was 2,200,000 dollars, when the &s;tate had &s;ub&s;cribed her quota 65,000 dollars, Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on's</HI> &s;ub&s;cription would have been charged to her until &s;he had delivered continental certificates to that amount, be&s;ides the difference between 16 and 20 &s;hillings in the pound. But it will be a&s;ked, why does not this mi&s;take happen in all the other &s;ub&s;crip|tions, becau&s;e <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> previou&s;ly charged the &s;ame amount to Congre&s;s, and the only difference to <HI>Penn&s;yl|vania</HI>
<PB N="699" REF="027132_0707_0FD354C8013FB7A8">
is the difference between the balance of ca&s;h and &s;tock; but we are told that we can charge Congre&s;s with every thing of this kind, I an&s;wer, let any gentleman look at the books, and there is not a &s;ingle New-Loan certificate charged to them, but the whole is &s;unk at the lo&s;s of this &s;tate. Either the Comptroller-General knew this would not be received, or what is mo&s;t probable that he knew it was not payable out of the public Trea|&s;ury, or if payable, it mu&s;t have been &s;unk as before.</P>
<P>But, again, it may be &s;aid that all the&s;e mi&s;takes might be rectified, and the time for the &s;ettlement might be extended by Congre&s;s, I an&s;wer, that it is not expectable that &s;uch an indulgence could be granted, &s;uch a privilege might be obtained by an humble petiti|on to Congre&s;s. In this critical &s;ituation &s;he could not obtain a &s;ingle farthing of &s;tock until &s;he lodged her continental certificates for it.</P>
<P>But if it is nece&s;&s;ary to recur to the words of the law, we will &s;ee if Congre&s;s had countenanced this extrava|gant idea, we will &s;ee that Congre&s;s did not a&s;&s;ume the debts of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> which &s;he did not determine to re|deem, they &s;ay, they will a&s;&s;ume the debts of the differ|ent &s;tates, but will they determine for the &s;tates their debts, or &s;ay, they'll pay what the &s;tates &s;ay <HI>they'll</HI> not pay, (Mr. <HI>Inger&s;oll</HI> then read the 13th &s;ection of the law of Congre&s;s, of Augu&s;t 4,1790.) Here, &s;ir, is certainly no intimation that Congre&s;s meant to determine what that debt was. (The letter page 81-2 was then read and commented on.) This is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the law, and the Attorney-General of the United States con&s;trues the Act exactly as I do. If any di&s;pute &s;hould ari&s;e between an individual and the &s;tate of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> Congre&s;s will not undertake to determine. <HI>"It is noth|ing to us, &s;ettle it among your&s;elves, we will not inter|meddle."</HI> From the character and &s;ituation of the writer of this letter we mu&s;t acknowledge that he determines the que&s;tion of a&s;&s;umability, not redeemability. Now, Sir, we have the opinion of the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, and the declaration of the Attorney-General, the fir&s;t
<PB N="700" REF="027132_0708_0FD354DD95BE7B88">
law-officer and the United States, that if there be an Act <HI>in form of a law,</HI> declaring them not payable, they are not a&s;&s;umable. Have any di&s;pute ari&s;en that there is &s;uch a law? The law is dated 1 April 1790, page 790, this &s;hews the Legi&s;lature did not con&s;ider the conti|nentale certificates the property of the &s;tate, until the New-Loans were redeemed. But again, we are told that Congre&s;s &s;peaks of the New-Loans as a&s;&s;umable; this is &s;trange, is it improper that Congre&s;s &s;hould provide not to a&s;&s;ume twice the &s;ame debt? therefore they have intro|duced a clau&s;e which the Secretary by his con&s;truction hath rendered intelligible. (Mr. <HI>Inger&s;oll</HI> then read the 18th &s;ection of the Act of Congre&s;s of Augu&s;t 4, 1790.)</P>
<P>Now, Sir, there is not a &s;yllable in this &s;ection about &s;urrendering up the counterparts to the United States; therefore agreeably to the literal common con&s;truction, had a New-Loan holder &s;ub&s;cribed 6d. <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> mu&s;t re&s;tore the &s;ame, or the &s;ub&s;cription on her ac|count mu&s;t be &s;u&s;pended; it is however true, that the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury hath put a much more ra|tional con&s;truction on the Act. If you &s;ub&s;cribe &pound;.100 of New-Loans to the loan, an hundred pounds of Con|tinental certificates mu&s;t be &s;urrendered to the United States, both certificates being evidences of one debt. But is that determining what are &s;tate debts, and what not? that would be to encourage the New-Loan hold|ers to controvert the Secretary's con&s;truction. If there are New Loans i&s;&s;ued and are &s;ub&s;cribed, then you mu&s;t deliver up an equal amount of Continental cer|tificates. The Secretary of the Trea&s;ury tells you in his letter (page 76-7-8-9, which Mr. <HI>Inger&s;oll</HI> read and commented upon.) It was pre&s;ented to the Secretary as if the Act of 1786 had not been repealed. No doubts were ever &s;ugge&s;ted <HI>to him</HI> that there had been any law declaring them no debt.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s lay in this manner until Augu&s;t 21, 1793, when the Secretary wrote to the Governor (page 218-9, which was likewi&s;e read and commented upon by him.) Here were &s;ix months at lea&s;t, from Febru|ary
<PB N="701" REF="027132_0709_0FD354DE80FD4FA8">
to Augu&s;t, a &s;ufficient time to make up their mind, and then the New-Loans were rejected totally as not &s;ub&s;cribable. It was the clo&s;ing of the account with the &s;tate of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> which excluded them, and not the lap&s;e of time. Now, what doubt remains? It &s;aid, that it was not &s;tated to Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI> in a pro|minent point of view, that the law of 1789 was pa&s;&s;ed after the Federal Con&s;titution was adopted. I a&s;k, would it affect the bu&s;ine&s;s if it had? O heavens! had we no principles of legi&s;lation until 1788 and 1789? Were we born ye&s;terday? Were we novices? Let us not entertain an idea &s;o degrading. If we entered into a contract before that period, could we abrogate that contract? It is true the United States in this as well as in other re&s;pects decline to meddle with con|tracts; but, Sir, were not the &s;ame principles held be|fore that time? Yes; they were argued at the bar, and in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives; and the Hou&s;e de|cided they might con&s;titutionally repeal the law of 1786. The Secretary of the Trea&s;ury &s;ays, if you have a difference, &s;ettle it between your&s;elves. The Judiciary of the United States have no right to decide between <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> and her own citizens; I cannot &s;ee with what good rea&s;ons they adduce a compari&s;on re&s;pecting the &s;uability of &s;tates but in regard of their being exi&s;ting debts. Mr. <HI>Randolph</HI> tells us, it is enough that your laws do not recognize them as debts. But to put this in a more prominent point of view, the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, a member of the Grand Convention, a gentleman &s;o acute and enlightened, can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that it e&s;caped <HI>him?</HI> Nay, the At|torney-General and the Commi&s;&s;ioners of accounts!</P>
<P>Does not the hi&s;tory of the a&s;&s;umption &s;hew their &s;en&s;e? The rea&s;ons no more apply to the New-Loan certificates than the mo&s;t remote &s;ubject which the mind of man can contemplate. (Mr. <HI>Inger&s;oll</HI> then read 3d vol. debates of Congre&s;s, page 41, 485.) Were the New-Loan holders clamorous at the door of Congre&s;s? What was it to the New-Loan creditors in <HI>Penn&s;ylva|nia</HI>
<PB N="702" REF="027132_0710_0FD354C9912D7218">
that <HI>Shays</HI> made his appearance in <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts?</HI> Were not the five millions exchanging without a mur|mur, and reduced to fifty thou&s;and pounds? Was the principal or intere&s;t then payable? We have it from our learned opponents them&s;elves that the funds were withdrawn. We will by and by con&s;ider that that debt was never to be paid by this &s;tate, and unle&s;s they &s;hould be lo&s;t or by &s;ome other ca&s;ualty, not a New-Loan would have been out in the cour&s;e of time allot|ted for exchanging them. There is no rea&s;on to be|lieve that Congre&s;s &s;hould be induced to pay the New-Loans, for the United States do not any where &s;ay, we will pay that debt whether <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> will redeem it or not; but in ca&s;es where the creditor could call on the &s;tate, it never entered into their contemplation to a&s;&s;ume &s;uch debts. No idea is &s;ugge&s;ted that Con|gre&s;s would pay le&s;s than that mentioned on the face of their contract, and of cour&s;e no rea&s;on to believe Congre&s;s would a&s;&s;ume them. But we have it in proof that all the confidential officers of the United States were directed to keep clear of them, if they wanted the due recognition of the &s;tate as exi&s;ting debts.</P>
<P>Then, Sir, the laws of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> are the te&s;t to determine whether they were or were not &s;ub&s;cribable. I will therefore a&s;k, whether the New-Loans are recog|nized as an exi&s;ting debt on or about the 10th of April 1792, and whether they were payable at that pre&s;ent, or at a future period, or at an indefinite time? This brings me to the laborious ta&s;k of &s;hewing by tracing through the laws, what I think the Senate have al|ready &s;een, that the law of 1789 rendered them no longer a debt or evidence of a debt.</P>
<P>It hath been &s;aid, and I &s;ub&s;cribe to it, that &s;tatutes mu&s;t not be judged of by the opinions of members, but mu&s;t be expounded by the common and u&s;ual rules. Adhering then to this principle, it will not be difficult to demon&s;trate, that after the pa&s;&s;ing of the Act of March 27, 1789, they were no longer a debt or evi|dence of a debt due by the &s;tate. In the fir&s;t place it

is nece&s;&s;ary to know what the law meant; then let us try it by the Con&s;titution, and &s;ee whether it will abide that te&s;t. (Mr. <HI>Inger&s;oll</HI> then read the title.) The title of this law is prepared, and affixed after the whole &s;cope is gone through, and the law is for repealing a former one, and by that, to repeal the payment of principal and intere&s;t. Pa&s;&s;ing on then, in order to know the rea&s;ons, and of con&s;equence the extent of the repeal, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e the law con&s;onant with the intention and declared views of the Legi&s;lature without examining them. If the law of 1786 was not tempo|rary, and this law &s;ays &s;o, it is a coincident circum|&s;tance, and mu&s;t be &s;o taken. (Mr. <HI>Inger&s;oll</HI> then read the preamble.)</P>
<P>The aggregate fund was the foundation of the con|tract, and the leading circum&s;tance; now the motive comes&mdash;"It is rea&s;onable and ju&s;t;" this is putting the Acts of 1785 and 1786 on the &s;ame footing, and all agree that the former provi&s;ion was temporary. Having a&s;&s;igned the&s;e rea&s;ons they proceed to the e|nacting clau&s;e (fir&s;t &s;ection then read.) This, it is &s;aid was only withdrawing the funds. Were there any funds by the Act of 1786? The funds were created by the Act of 1785: No. Therefore, there is &s;omething more; they &s;peak of more Acts than one. The rea|&s;on a&s;&s;igned by the coun&s;el for the defendant, the mo&s;t inapplicable of all others, that is, &s;u&s;pence and delay. Was this a time to &s;eek for &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, when the &s;tate was receiving the &s;ums due her from the Continent? She then had the immen&s;e fund of a Land-office, the arts, manufactures and agriculture flouri&s;hing, this fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> the time when <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> like a pauper is p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">g time of payment as repre&s;ented by the oppo&s;ite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">y!

I have &s;aid that the recital if true, was in fact what repealed this law. It is &s;uffi|cient
<PB N="704" REF="027132_0712_0FD354937665DB88">
for my purpo&s;e, if in their under&s;tanding they entertained the &s;ame view, it had the &s;ame effect on them, whether well or ill founded. When they &s;peak of repealing the law of 1785 as well as the law of 1786, they apply it to the principal and intere&s;t; when they make the provi&s;ion temporary, they apply that to the intere&s;t only, but it is not &s;o; there is not a &s;ingle let|ter in the law which makes the di&s;tinction. I think it &s;afer to take their view from the Acts them&s;elves, than at &s;econd hand. (Mr. <HI>Inger&s;oll</HI> then read the &s;ection.) As the funds were temporary the provi&s;ion cea&s;ed al&s;o. If the provi&s;ion will cea&s;e, will not the funds al&s;o cea&s;e? Is it po&s;&s;ible to wink &s;o hard as not to &s;ee? What re|lief is to remain if the funds e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Acts of 1785 and 1786 are to cea&s;e? If the tedious road &s;o often trod mu&s;t again be travelled over, although I do not think it nece&s;&s;ary, I think the&s;e plau&s;ible rea&s;ons for withdrawing the funds; foreign as well as dome&s;|tic creditors were to be paid. This Hou&s;e cannot for|get the difference between that and the pre&s;ent day. A di&s;&s;olution of the Confederacy was apprehended, that the debts of the Union would never be di&s;charg|ed, or at lea&s;t not until a very di&s;tant period, each &s;tate to take care of its own people. Under this a&s;pect of public affairs, the Act of 16th of March 1785, the fir&s;t law on this &s;ubject, was pa&s;&s;ed, to continue until Congre&s;s &s;hould provide; notwith&s;tanding the&s;e a&s;|per&s;ions, it reflect eternal honour on the authors of it. She u&s;ed the funds which were not applied to the creditors generally. This was not her fault&mdash; it was attributable to &s;ome of the ea&s;tern &s;tates, but <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> was never the original debtor; &s;he was only &s;urety for the United States. Why not hunt the lion more generou&s;ly? Why &s;earch up the&s;e &s;leeping Acts?</P>
<P>The Legi&s;lature of 1785 in&s;tead of &s;eeking an excu&s;e to evade the requi&s;itions of Congre&s;s, contributed every farthing required of them. It can be &s;hewn by the &s;tatements of the defendant him&s;elf, that there was a
<PB N="705" REF="027132_0713_0FD35480F19EA300">
balance in her favour in &s;pecie, and in indents, nece&s;|&s;arily po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing as &s;he did &s;o large a portion of certifi|cates; the law of 1785 provides for creditors of <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania,</HI> and al&s;o for the requi&s;itions to Congre&s;s. The manner how this payment was made thro' the agency of the continental officers hath been already &s;ufficiently explained. Congre&s;s was afraid le&s;t the exci&s;e would be &s;u&s;pended, and for fear of offending foreign &s;tates or foreign creditors in Sept. 1785, for the rea&s;ons be|fore mentioned, pa&s;&s;ed their re&s;olution, 11 Volume, page 328-9, to defeat the operation of that law, it will appear that it was not a complaint that the requi&s;itions were not complied with; but that notwith&s;tanding they &s;hould not pay the citizen creditors of any State in pre|ference to the foreign creditors: The honorable Senate, no doubt, recollect the difference between that time and the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew, altho' I do not think it nece&s;&s;ary, that the Act of 1786 was intended as a tem|porary relief only. To under&s;tand the&s;e laws, it is nece&s;&s;ary to be reminded of the &s;ituation of the United States, the debilitated State of the confederacy, and the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation of the public creditors. A di&s;&s;o|lution of the confederacy was apprehended, that the debts of the Union would never be di&s;charged, or, at lea&s;t until a very di&s;tant period.</P>
<P>Under this a&s;pect of public affairs the fir&s;t law of this &s;ubject was pa&s;&s;ed on the 16th March 1785, and to con|tinue until Congre&s;s &s;hould provide; this Act provides for the annual requi&s;itions of Congre&s;s, be&s;ides taking care of its own people, the creditor citizens of <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding the reflections again&s;t this law, it reflects eternal honor on the authors of it, &s;he u&s;ed the funds which went not to the creditors generally, the delinquency was not attributed to her, but to the Ea&s;tern States; &s;he never was the original debtor, &s;he was only &s;urety, and not the principal; it was her duty to bring it forward in &s;ome manner to make it a charge again&s;t the United States, the object was con&s;idered
<PB N="706" REF="027132_0714_0FD35496A311E3D8">
the &s;ame, altho' the mode of obtaining it was different, then when the principal had been ready to pay why &s;hould we hunt up the&s;e &s;leeping Acts with a view to embarra&s;s this bu&s;ine&s;s? Altho' Congre&s;s admitted the purity of the motives which actuated <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> &s;he neverthele&s;s re&s;olved that any intere&s;t which &s;hould be paid after the fir&s;t of January, 1786, &s;hould not be allowed.</P>
<P>But as Congre&s;s defeated the operations of the Act of 1785, it became nece&s;&s;ary to carry that law into effect, in &s;uch a manner, as to make it a charge again&s;t the United States; this, Sir, was the whole motive, altho' the mode of doing the bu&s;ine&s;s was different, the &s;ub|&s;tance was the &s;ame; and the better to &s;ave appear|ances, the certificates purported to be for &s;o much money received on loan; did this bring the New-Loans within the term of State debts? <HI>State debt</HI> has a definite meaning, including debts on a continental account, and debts contracted on her own proper ac|count. Yet, as every per&s;on well knew, a definite meaning, when the creditor had only recour&s;e to the &s;tate, and not to Congre&s;s. The defendant's coun&s;el have been diametrically oppo&s;ite on this &s;ubject; Con|gre&s;s would never have complained of the law of 1786 had the Legi&s;lature confined them&s;elves to the redemp|tion of their proper &s;tate debt, and yet we find them deputing a committee from their body to endeavour to effect the de&s;truction of the law of 1786, (&s;ee report, page 319, 320 of this.) What was the rea&s;oning of the &s;tate on that occa&s;ion? The Legi&s;lature had no de&s;ign to &s;eparate the contract from the fund, they con|&s;idered the fund as the e&s;&s;ence of the contract, they &s;ay, we are ready to pay our quota, and to comply with our requi&s;itions, and until that is done we cannot with|draw the funds, the law of 1786 mu&s;t remain until a general provi&s;ion is made by Congre&s;s&mdash;When the pe|riod had arrived, mentioned in the Act of 1785, &s;o far as it re&s;pects the payment of principal or intere&s;t of the New-Loan debt, a repeal took place; this we con|tend

had extingui&s;hed the debt, our opponents in&s;i&s;t it only withdrew the funds.</P>
<P>This &s;hews the compact was not to be final and com|plete until all the &s;tates &s;hould agree. Here are prin|ciples in which we and our opponents agree; let us &s;ee how far. Can't you, &s;ays Congre&s;s, withdraw the funds? <HI>"Withdraw the funds,"</HI> &s;ays the A&s;&s;embly &s;purning at the idea, and leave our contract a <HI>caput mortuum;</HI> at pre&s;ent we cannot withdraw the&s;e funds without &s;ub&s;tituting others in their place, but when halcyon days will come, then we will withdraw them; you will know that taking the&s;e funds would be leaving our own creditors di&s;appointed; this is perfectly con|&s;i&s;tent, and agreeable to our con&s;truction, the mea&s;ure is not precipitate; (other paragraphs of the report was then read.) I will not pro&s;titute the dignity of my profe&s;&s;ion by eva&s;ion, had I under&s;tood it as the defend|ant's coun&s;el, I would not have attempted to reconcile it with the con&s;titution, or the eternal rules of ju&s;tice. I admit the intention of the &s;tate was to make a pro|vi&s;ion commen&s;urate with the funds.&mdash;But I contend here as I did el&s;ewhere, that they did not &s;eparate the contract from the fund, nor did the &s;tate continue to owe after they were di&s;charged from the payment.</P>
<P>Therefore I contend, that when the period had ar|rived, and Congre&s;s were under an efficient government, it then became nece&s;&s;ary for <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> to "modify the payment." Grant me this and it leads to all that I contend for; for it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew that the funds made u&s;e of on this occa&s;ion were not taken after they had been given up to Congre&s;s. (Mr. <HI>Inger&s;oll</HI> then read &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages from the 8th volume or the Jour|nals of Congre&s;s, page 187, to &s;hew that the execution of the re&s;olutions were expre&s;sly &s;u&s;pended until they &s;hould be acceded to by every &s;tate in the Union.)</P>
<P><HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> in September 23, 1783, complied with the requi&s;ition, with a provi&s;o that the Act was not to take effect until each &s;tate in the Union had pa&s;&s;ed &s;imi|lar laws. In page 194, <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> by a long addre&s;s
<PB N="708" REF="027132_0716_0FD354E17990C930">
&s;ympathized with Congre&s;s, and as Mr. <HI>Lewis</HI> ob&s;erv|ed, &s;he copied the re&s;olution into her Act, and conclud|ed that it &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended until the twelve other &s;tates &s;hould comply with the &s;ame. Now where is the foundation for reproach? How did the &s;tate by the Act of 1786 pa&s;s an Act which was void? No funds were taken away from Congre&s;s; no requi&s;itions were neglected; but they were anticipated. The Compt|roller's own &s;tatements for December 6, 1786&mdash;No|vember 3, 1787, and November 4, 1788, &s;hew that the &s;tate complied punctually with all the requi&s;itions of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>On the 27th July 1786 there remained a balance in the Trea&s;ury of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> of above &s;ixty thou&s;and dollars, and the Comptroller adds, that a balance up|wards of 30,000 dollars remained due to her in Octo|ber 1787; not to mention the amount of indents, of which I need not take up your time to &s;hew it; for &s;he always had indents enough. It is however true, there was another requi&s;ition then made, but never complied with, that is, two year's intere&s;t to the foreign credi|tors, and one year's ditto to dome&s;tic creditors, who were citizens. This I will di&s;mi&s;s, as no other &s;tate complied, the requi&s;ition being unrea&s;onable.</P>
<P>Is <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> then criminal? &s;he was eminently in advance before 1786. Surely there is no rea&s;on for &s;ug|ge&s;ting that the law of 1786 was void with re&s;pect to the funds. (Mr. <HI>Morris,</HI> the Speaker of the Senate, interrupted Mr. <HI>Inger&s;oll,</HI> and &s;ugge&s;ted, that the en|quiry was, whether "the form of the certificates binds the &s;tate, and if it is admitted a debt by the Act of 1786, whether it makes the obligation permanent, this &s;tate con&s;enting by that Act to be a creditor of the Union, no doubts could preclude the creditors from their rights." Mr. <HI>Inger&s;oll</HI> replied, My an&s;wer to that will be this, If I receive an obligation payable to bearer, I agree, that I am not to look farther than the face of the writing, but the&s;e certificates refer to the Act, and it is as much an intimation to the holders of the
<PB N="709" REF="027132_0717_0FD35498CEA65208">
nature of the contract, as if the whole Act had been tran&s;cribed and embodied into them, becau&s;e they are referred to the Act. Mr. <HI>Inger&s;oll</HI> then read the form of a New-Loan certificate, &s;ee page 317.)</P>
<P>As to the ob&s;ervations made re&s;pecting the minutes of Council of Feb. 3, 1785, the&s;e refer to the law of 1785, which is clearly of a temporary nature, and the law it&s;elf expre&s;&s;es it &s;o. It contradicts the defendant's leading principles and contends that unfunding the debt is a violation of the contract; the one cannot cea&s;e, unle&s;s the other cea&s;es; the fund and obligation mu&s;t go together; the&s;e, Sir, are &s;ome of the arguments appli|ed to the Act of 1785, and yet that law &s;peaks a lan|guage which no &s;ophi&s;try can confound. (Mr. <HI>Inger&s;oll</HI> then read the 18th &s;ection of that law, page 467.) Now, Sir, the&s;e rea&s;onings of the Supreme Executive Council de&s;troy the idea, that contracts may exi&s;t with|out funds. I do not know why the&s;e were read unle&s;s to pa&s;s cen&s;ure on the A&s;&s;embly of 1785.</P>
<P>How does this agree with the rea&s;oning imputed to the A&s;&s;embly of 1789? The funds are withdrawn, and no others are &s;ub&s;tituted; but I have &s;aid, and it mu&s;t be again noticed, altho' they have given a rea&s;on for withdrawing the funds at March 1789, yet no rea&s;ons are given for cancelling the debt, was it not for <HI>not paying</HI> the debt? A CURIOUS DEBT INDEED! It is agreed, that the funds were withdrawn, no other funds were &s;ub&s;tituted or promi&s;ed, and the &s;tate were not compellable to give any, depending altogether on will and plea&s;ure, not obligatory in con&s;cience, neither moral nor political obligation, <HI>a &s;trange debt!</HI> a con|tract never to be executed cannot be a debt. This puts me in mind of <HI>Martin</HI> and <HI>Crambe;&mdash;Crambe</HI> &s;wore that he could frame a conception of a Lord-Mayor not only without his hor&s;e, gown and gold chain, but even without &s;tatute, feature, colour, hands, head, feet, or any body, which he &s;uppo&s;ed was the <HI>ab&s;tract</HI> of a Lord-Mayor.</P>
<P>A certificate remains as blank paper, is it obligatory
<PB N="710" REF="027132_0718_0FD3548253EC6338">
becau&s;e it enables the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to come to the Compt|roller-General and to get back his continental certifi|cate? Is it a debt payable at the pre&s;ent time, or at any future period? Does not a debt exi&s;t <HI>ex vi termini?</HI> Does it not imply an obligation? True it does, if "de&s;irous" or optional, a choice; yes, the law gives a choice, but it is <HI>Hob&s;on's</HI> choice, that or none, and when one &s;ays, it is not to be paid, it is in other words, &s;aying <HI>"I am not indebted;"</HI> in name, optional; in effect, obligatory.</P>
<P><HI>"Directs</HI> and <HI>&s;ecures,"</HI>&mdash;directing and &s;ecuring were included in the a&s;&s;umption, it was that and more too, the certificate it&s;elf &s;ecured the debt, as they allege, but the debt was not &s;ecured, there exi&s;ted no obliga|tion to provide a fund, what a&s;&s;ume a debt not paya|ble? that is, in other words to &s;ay, that the common|wealth is not in debt.</P>
<P>It was attempted to di&s;tingui&s;h between princi|pal and intere&s;t, and that temporary funds only apply to intere&s;t. Does the Act &s;hew it in this manner? Do the re&s;olutions point it out thus? hath this cir|cum&s;tance e&s;caped the notice of the A&s;&s;embly?&mdash; No&mdash;But the minutes &s;hew that the bu&s;ine&s;s was pointedly brought before them; fir&s;t, the intere&s;t was only attended to, then it was po&s;tponed, and the clau&s;e was added, every Act or Acts directing or &s;ecuring the payment of principal and intere&s;t. (Mr. <HI>Inger&s;oll</HI> then read the motion, page 184.) Here then the A&s;&s;embly have brought the principal and intere&s;t fully into view, this &s;hews the Legi&s;lature meant the principal al&s;o, as they did not de&s;ign to di&s;tingui&s;h. Now as to the intere&s;t not to be perpetual, it was to be temporary, if Congre&s;s &s;hould provide; if not, it was to be final. Mr. <HI>Lewis</HI> ob&s;erved that <HI>temporary</HI> was meant to be <HI>partial;</HI> but no words are le&s;s &s;ynonymous than <HI>tempo|rary</HI> and <HI>partial.</HI> They meant the payment of princi|pal and intere&s;t until Congre&s;s &s;hould provide.</P>
<P>Much reliance hath been placed on the word <HI>"many,"</HI> this word was introduced without any pointed attention,
<PB N="711" REF="027132_0719_0FD35483EA1F4B70">
there was no u&s;e for it, the clau&s;e fir&s;t &s;tood without it, and regarded only the intere&s;t. (Mr. <HI>Inger&s;oll</HI> then read the minutes to the Act of 10th April 1792.) This was only nece&s;&s;ary as it regarded the equalizing the in|tere&s;t and the exchange. Another rea&s;on offers for con&s;ideration, this funding &s;y&s;tem in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> was the &s;ymbol of party, and was looked upon by &s;ome as &s;ound policy, by others it was looked upon the very rever&s;e. At the time this law pa&s;&s;ed, Congre&s;s had not begun to pa&s;s their laws, many &s;uppo&s;ed the Act of 1789 might be repealed, and of con&s;equence the law of 1785 might be revived with all the debt, of cour&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they provided for the exchange, and with a view to get rid of the que&s;tion left the choice with the party, it being then not known what provi&s;ion Congre&s;s would make.</P>
<P>But, the&s;e things, like general rules, have their ex|ceptions: Bills of credit are barred by particular Acts to come forward as contracts, which the &s;tate cannot controul. Contracts are de&s;troyed when the party is excu&s;ed from carrying it into effect; therefore the New-Loan holders on agreeing to the Con&s;titution of the United States, and withdrawing the funds, di&s;charges the &s;tate from the performance of the contract. There is no analogy between the&s;e and the <HI>North-Carolina</HI> certificates; there they were i&s;&s;ued in collu&s;ion, and not for Continental certificates; there they are not binding on that &s;tate; rea&s;ons of that kind may occur here, where the certificates are only temporary in their duration. How will the contracts of the United States &s;tand this te&s;t? Are not the continental bills contracts? Are New-Loans contracts? Are they not continually re|ducing by exchanges? Are the bills of credit of <HI>Penn&s;yl|vania</HI> to revive as contracts? The&s;e particulars &s;hew that the principle was e&s;tabli&s;hed, and as old as go|vernment, that contracts mu&s;t be abided by, and held &s;acred, and that &s;ome of them can be controuled?</P>
<P>If I enter into a contract with my neighbour, and he prevents me from doing part, &s;hall I by that be compelled to do another part? Was there ever a cir|cum&s;tance
<PB N="712" REF="027132_0720_0FD354E2F71C8540">
where the party is excu&s;ed from carrying it into effect, if the contract remained irrevocable? The contract cea&s;es wholly, or remains altogether to be carried into effect. How were we circum&s;tanced in 1789? Why, the &s;ocial compact takes out of the hands of the &s;tate certain funds. The New-Loan holders repre&s;ented in Convention, and acquie&s;cing to the adop|tion of the Federal Con&s;titution, agreed to the tran&s;|action and excu&s;ed the A&s;&s;embly from a performance of their former agreement; and it is conceded that <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> by good faith might &s;urrender the&s;e funds, and were under no obligation to &s;ub&s;titute others. Is this faith? Is this ju&s;tice? Is this a good principle? Where is the &s;ub&s;tance or rea&s;on for this procedure? Why! either the funds are pledged for ever, or the contract is temporary. I mean by this, either the&s;e funds mu&s;t remain or others mu&s;t be &s;ub&s;tituted in their room.</P>
<P>If I had under&s;tood the Act of 1789 as contended for by the defendant, I would never have appeared here. To &s;ay that the Act of 1786 was perpetual and not temporary, and yet to &s;ay <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> may take away tho&s;e and not &s;ub&s;titute others, is imputing to her &s;uch fraudulent incon&s;i&s;tency, that I cannot be|lieve it.</P>
<P>Either the debt cea&s;ed to be &s;uch by the Act of March 1789, or the A&s;&s;embly was bound by every principle of honour and ju&s;tice to &s;ub&s;titute other funds immediately.</P>
<P>There is a &s;hort te&s;t to try this. If the funds are taken away, the intere&s;t at your Trea&s;ury is not paid half yearly. If the contract is not affected, the hold|ers may always draw the intere&s;t. (Mr. <HI>Inger&s;oll</HI> then read the form of a New-Loan certificate.) But they &s;ay the obligation remains; then let them turn to page 63, Act April, 1791, where they will find that the certificates come within the purpart law of that date. (Part of the law then read, and a repetition of the calculation of the parts of &s;tock as in page 329 of this.)

If they were evidences of debt, they were payable un|der the Act of April 9, 1791) although it was never attempted to introduce them thereunder as redeemable. The Act for the relief of <HI>Sarah Caldwell</HI> only autho|ri&s;es a &s;ub&s;cription of the Continental certificates in tru&s;t, in the dome&s;tic loan of Congre&s;s; and only amounts to putting her in the &s;ame &s;ituation as if &s;he had New-Loans. There is no analogy between this ca&s;e and that of the certificates of <HI>North-Carolina.</HI> Re-i&s;&s;uing the paper money was for the purpo&s;e of en|couraging the exchange. It is di&s;agreeable to have an obligation abroad, though it be paid. The hold|ers of New-Loan certificates naturally wi&s;hed not to exchange, as this was their intere&s;t; for &pound;. 100 in New-Loans produced 6 per cent. intere&s;t; but if exchanged it only produced 3 per cent. This of cour&s;e introduced the practice of encouraging the New-Loan holders to exchange their New-Loans for the Continental certifi|cates. (Mr. <HI>Inger&s;oll</HI> then read the preamble and &s;un|dry pa&s;&s;ages of the law of the 7th of April 1791, to enforce his arguments, that the obligation was di&s;|charged although out&s;tanding, and although it was not obligatory, the &s;tate wanted it to cea&s;e being in ex|i&s;tence, in order to have the care and cu&s;tody of her own property.)</P>
<P>It hath been &s;ugge&s;ted, that the &s;tate paid intere&s;t on certificates between September 1777 and March 1778, calculated on a reduced value, and charged Congre&s;s at the &s;pecie value. Trace the circum&s;tances of pub|lic affairs, and you will find the repealing law was founded not on affected, but real nece&s;&s;ity, and &s;ee if the period had not arrived, when the law of 1786 cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The grand convention ended the 17th September 1787. <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> adopted the con&s;titution the 13th December &s;ame year. The ninth &s;tate adopted it on the 21&s;t of June 1789, and in July 1789 Congre&s;s pa&s;&s;ed a law impo&s;ing duties to operate the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t; of con&s;equence, they might well &s;ay, it <HI>"would &s;oon cea&s;e."</HI></P>
<P>It it true the A&s;&s;embly might have waited until the

funds were actually taken out of their hands by Con|gre&s;s, that they did not, was the principal cau&s;e of com|plaint with the New-Loan holders. Therefore the New-Loan debt cea&s;ed, and was no longer operative, but to get back the continental certificates, and the ar|rears of intere&s;t.</P>
<P>But, let us turn to the Act of 1786, and &s;ee what part of it will remain after the repeal. (Mr. <HI>Inger&s;oll</HI> then went over the different &s;ections and clau&s;es of that law, to point out the import of the words and the meaning of the Act, and concluded by ob&s;erving that it was indifferent to him what time the Senate would adjourn to, but earne&s;tly reque&s;ted to have the privilege of fini&s;hing that evening.)</P>

<P>Mr. INGERSOLL, in continuation.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Senate,</HI></P>
<P>In addition to the ob&s;ervations made by me this fore|noon, by which I have &s;hewn that the debt was extin|gui&s;hed, a debt never to be paid principal or intere&s;t, and that this debt was not a&s;&s;umable, nor &s;ub&s;cribable to the loan, after the pa&s;&s;ing of the Act of March 27, 1789, it will be recollected that the que&s;tion for ge|neral enquiry and con&s;ideration, will be, whether un|der the&s;e circum&s;tances was or was not this law con|&s;titutional? Congre&s;s will not con&s;ider the con&s;titution|ality of the law; it is a di&s;pute between the holder and the &s;tate of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI> She neither could nor will determine &s;uch di&s;putes; it is &s;ufficient that they cea&s;ed to be a debt; they are not a&s;&s;umable; the defendant is unwilling to meet the que&s;tion; his coun&s;el now urge that the law is uncon&s;titutional: It is agreed the &s;tate might &s;u&s;pend the payment of intere&s;t, withdraw the funds and modify the payment of the principal.</P>
<P>The funds were a part of the contract, they acquir|ed the credit, <HI>they induced the loan.</HI> The coun&s;el for the defendant have conceded a principle which leads to all the con&s;equences we deduce. <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> can alter the terms of her contract; the principles are e&s;ta|bli&s;hed from which they can never retrieve them&s;elves. The &s;tate of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> has the &s;ame rights as a private per&s;on. My creditor pre&s;cribes an alteration on agreement; I cannot do it nor can he do it &s;ingly. If the &s;tate authori&s;es to alter the contract, &s;he may
<PB N="716" REF="027132_0724_0FD354E6D6036040">
authori&s;e the abolition of it. Will the gentlemen con|tend, that a conference had been held between the &s;tate of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> and the holders of New-Loan certificates? The &s;tate &s;peaks only by her laws, where the contract might be altered. The degree and extent of alteration mu&s;t be left at di&s;cretion, &s;ubject only to a &s;en&s;e of right and wrong, and is therefore not a ca&s;e within the Con&s;titution. (Mr. <HI>Inger&s;oll</HI> read the 10th &s;ection of the fir&s;t article of the Con&s;titution.) The New-Loans are out of the &s;pirit and letter of the Con|&s;titution of the United States; the law of 1789 im|pairs no contract. If it is but of the reach of the let|ter, it cannot be in the &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Let us recollect the comments of my learned col|league from <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> (Mr. <HI>Dexter)</HI> on the eternal principles of right and wrong obviou&s;ly oppo&s;ed to the principles of "perfidy," fraud and chicane, and I will not pretend to &s;ay how far it might &s;tand in a court of judicature.</P>
<P>The limitation and di&s;cretion relative of &s;uch altera|tions are never to be a&s;certained by the con&s;titution. The Comptroller-General's own plan of finance pro|po&s;es a limitation that would not be con&s;onant to the con&s;titution. Shall my creditor &s;ay, unle&s;s I call at a certain time I cannot have payment at all, this is &s;urely more repugnant to the con&s;titution than any thing in the Act of 1789. Congre&s;s is al&s;o re&s;tricted in the exerci&s;e of their legi&s;lative power, a variation from the original contract is propo&s;ed by the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury in his plan for the redemption and fund|ing the public debt, in&s;tead of whole 6 per cents. &s;ome are at 3 per cent. The &s;ame &s;pirit of variation has induced the &s;trained con&s;truction of the Act of the 10th of April 1792. The New-Loan creditors con|&s;truing the Act as we do, had applied to Congre&s;s and remon&s;trated again&s;t the conduct of the Secretary, I do not de&s;ign to ca&s;t any reflections on the Secretary, I am &s;atisfied, he was impelled by the pure&s;t motives for the public good. To excu&s;e therefore the conduct of
<PB N="717" REF="027132_0725_0FD354B5F725B8B8">
an individual, which is at lea&s;t excu&s;able, ought to be our duty; but I expect to be able to &s;hew that the New-Loan holders remon&s;trated to Congre&s;s again&s;t this de|viation from the original contract.</P>
<P>But it &s;hould be remembered that the Comptroller as a member of the community, a holder of New-Loan debt, and a creditor of the United States di&s;&s;olved in part the contract between <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> and her cre|ditors by acceding to the adoption of the con&s;titution of the United States; he has al&s;o acted for years as a &s;ervant of the public in the execution of this very act &mdash;no matter whether a man &s;hews his mind from words or actions.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t 2, 1789, (&s;ee debates of Congre&s;s, 2 vol. page 280) the New-Loan holders applied to Congre&s;s, and in &s;trong language they call them <HI>"our only hope."</HI> Here, Mr. Speaker, you may preceive their &s;ilence, their ac|quie&s;cence, O charming infancy! their &s;ilence fir&s;t, then their application to Congre&s;s, and all this corre&s;pond|ence is to be no proof of their acquie&s;cence! Five mil|lions of dollars were all exchanged except fifty thou&s;and pounds. The defendant purcha&s;ed of per&s;ons who had waved their claims as they had acquie&s;ced in the law; witne&s;s <HI>Biddle</HI> and <HI>Oldden;</HI> by their conduct they waved it; it is therefore po&s;&s;ible they transferred their rights to the defendant, or that he derived it from them. The meaning of the law of 1789 cannot be doubted, but at any rate it is unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that tho&s;e who have acted under a title for a cour&s;e of years in a com|munity can impeach it. Is the agent at liberty to di&s;|pute the commi&s;&s;ion under which he had acted &s;o long?</P>
<P>If, therefore, the New-Loans cea&s;ed to be a debt, they were not a&s;&s;umable, and there was no nece&s;&s;ity for the certification of the defendant. Why then did the Comptroller-General certify them <HI>genuine</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;um|able,</HI> and then recognize them as debts, and pa&s;s them as a&s;&s;umable and redeemable? It is denied that the Comptroller-General certified New-Loans to be a&s;&s;um|able, or if he did, it was but in a few in&s;tances, not
<PB N="718" REF="027132_0726_0FD3546441CB6D48">
in his own ca&s;e, and not in his character as Compt|roller-General. It is al&s;o &s;aid, that it is not alleged, he certified them <HI>&s;o;</HI> that therefore the proof is in&s;uf|ficient, and the charge un&s;upported. I will &s;hew that the articles of impeachment are &s;ufficient in &s;ub&s;tance and form, and &s;upported by the evidence. (Mr. <HI>Inger&s;oll</HI> then read the fir&s;t article.) I have given notice to the defendant's coun&s;el, that I would refer to ob&s;ervations well expre&s;&s;ed by <HI>Federali&s;t,</HI> 2d vol. page 210, on the propriety of impeachments&mdash;What is not criminal on an indictment is not &s;o on an impeachment; the le&s;s certainty is requi&s;ite in the latter than in the former. Cer|tifying in a few in&s;tances is as really criminal as in many, although not injurious in the &s;ame degree. If he cer|tified to any, he is criminal. It hath been &s;aid, that he is not charged in the articles, to whom he certified, whether to the Loan-officer, to a private per&s;on, or to a man in the country; he is excu&s;ed by not &s;igning officially! If the Comptroller-General, not <HI>John Ni|chol&s;on</HI> acting as &s;uch, certified New-Loans to be genu|ine and a&s;&s;umable, he well knew it was to the lo&s;s and ri&s;que of the commonwealth. It is &s;aid, that he did not add the title of his office, but only the initials of his name. I am &s;orry to find the defence of the Compt|roller General re&s;ting on &s;uch flim&s;y &s;ubterfuges. Has not the &s;ub&s;cribing the initials the &s;ame effect? is not the object the &s;ame? If &s;o, is it different whether the initials are written or the whole name? Are not the reports to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> A&s;&s;embly &s;igned in the &s;ame manner? And if he &s;hould have mi&s;led them he would be pu|ni&s;hed.</P>
<P>But it hath been &s;aid, that the evidence do not &s;up|port the charge, and that he did not &s;ign his own ab|&s;tract <HI>genuine</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;umable:</HI> If he certified for any one it is &s;ufficiently proved. Let us examine how his own bu&s;ine&s;s was managed, a long roll in his own hand|writing, and intended to make the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ion as if he had certified it <HI>genuine</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;umable;</HI> How would Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> rea&s;on on this? Would he &s;eparate tho&s;e ab|&s;tracts
<PB N="719" REF="027132_0727_0FD35465B65FD878">
which were certified <HI>genuine</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;umable</HI> from that in the Comptroller's own hand-writing? We find &s;ome circum&s;tances in his &s;ub&s;cription of a bad im|pre&s;&s;ion, which do not alleviate the charges, he &s;ub|&s;cribed in blank in the month of June, how was this filled up? Is he to &s;it on the watch in his office, that this blank &s;ub&s;cription continues open to the 7th or 8th of July, then the blank is filled up and the receipt anti-dated to the 30th of June? Is not this conduct mo&s;t exceptionable? Was not this done in his official capacity? If this is denied his corre&s;pondence on this &s;ubject mu&s;t be forgotten! (Mr. <HI>Inger&s;oll</HI> then read the letter, page 215-6; ditto page 217; ditto page 96-7; ditto page 97-8 of this work, commenting as he went along, to prove that the defendant acted in his official capacity when he certified the ab&s;tracts <HI>ge|nuine</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;umable.</HI>)</P>
<P>It can therefore admit of no controver&s;y that the Comptroller-General acted in his official capacity, we have proved he violated the law, the excu&s;e mu&s;t come from him, if no other excu&s;e comes from them, but an error of judgment, <HI>Humanum e&s;t errare,</HI> an error of judg|ment is certainly no ground for an impeachment; but if facts are &s;trong, and evidence conclu&s;ive, however painful it is to pronounce the &s;entence, it is inevitable; he mu&s;t be declared guilty. We con&s;ider him as acting from improper motives, and it &s;hould be remembered that when we probe the &s;ecret motives, and fathom the &s;entiments of the heart, truth does not appear in matters of evidence which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily end in probability only, with that re&s;i&s;tle&s;s conviction with which it pre|&s;ides in the mathematical &s;ciences, it is not to be ex|pected that it &s;hould operate with re&s;i&s;tle&s;s force.</P>
<P>But if after 1789 he &s;tates nothing of the New-Loan certificates as being a <HI>State debt,</HI> which before the pa&s;&s;ing of the Act of 1789 he uniformly and repeatedly did; if to go farther, from motives of private intere&s;t he has endeavoured to defeat the operations of a law, has taken money out of the trea&s;ury upon a pretended
<PB N="720" REF="027132_0728_0FD354674FE588C8">
con&s;ideration, then no one can he&s;itate and his guilt cannot be denied.</P>
<P>Did not the Comptroller-General know, that the &s;tock of the U. S. could not i&s;&s;ue, unle&s;s the conti|nental certificates the counterparts of the New-Loans or an equal value was previou&s;ly &s;urrendered to the United States; Mr. <HI>Donnald&s;on,</HI> the Regi&s;ter-General you find, thought &s;o. In his letter to the Governor (page 220-1-2) he repeats the &s;ame idea. I have but little to &s;ay on this point; Mr. <HI>Donnald&s;on</HI> fir&s;t heard of this out of doors, and concurred in opinion with the defendant, he was never con&s;ulted; he pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome ab|&s;tracts after he knew them to contain New-Loans, be|ing pre&s;&s;ed further, he acknowledged that he delivered one to Judge <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> in a mi&s;take; there is no law of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> authori&s;ing the &s;urrender of the continental certificates, the whole amount would be lo&s;t as the New-Loans could not be charged again&s;t the United States.</P>
<P>I a&s;k how will <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> get the &s;tock back, I pre|&s;ume it will not be &s;aid that the Comptroller will give it up. Suppo&s;e now an Act was to pa&s;s this &s;e&s;&s;ion, it is too late. The accounts between the United States and the individual &s;tates are now &s;ettled, they cannot be again opened; but it was hinted and but hinted by the Comptroller to the Regi&s;ter that he had or would &s;ettle that bu&s;ine&s;s with the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury of the United States. What! and no law on the &s;ubject! The &s;ub&s;cription was prevented by the interpo&s;ition of the Governor. Had the &s;ub&s;cription of the New-Loan cer|tificates been received, not only the difference between the &s;tock and 20&shilling;. in the pound would have been a gain to the Comptroller-General, but the whole &s;um of 65,000 dollars &s;ub&s;cribed, would be a lo&s;s to the commonwealth; and this was well known to the Comptroller-General.</P>
<P>But it is a&s;ked, why not pay 20&shilling;. in the pound? I an|&s;wer for many rea&s;ons&mdash;1. the New-Loans were not a &s;tate debt. 2. It was a debt of Congre&s;s. 3. If Congre&s;s deviated from their contract, we ought not to &s;uffer, nor
<PB N="721" REF="027132_0729_0FD3282CCB755D68">
ought their creditors to trouble us, when Congre&s;s was ready to pay them? there was a time when they might have had more than 20&shilling;. in the pound from Congre&s;s. 4. <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> had &s;aid &s;he would not pay them, and it is hard and humiliating that the Comptroller &s;hould controul the A&s;&s;embly. And 5. Becau&s;e Congre&s;s did not intend to a&s;&s;ume any certificates but what had i&s;&s;ued for &s;ervices or &s;upplies towards the pro&s;ecution of the late war, and the defence of the United States; and the New-Loan certificates are not charged by the Compt|roller in the account.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid, the A&s;&s;embly is not to deal in &s;tock&mdash; This is a mi&s;taken idea of the dignity of government; I conceive that even the difference between the value of &s;tock is not unworthy of Legi&s;lative interpo&s;ition; that Legi&s;lature which di&s;po&s;es of a &s;ingle dollar but to what it thinks to the be&s;t advantage of the public weal, betrays the tru&s;t of its con&s;tituents, whether it be &s;tock or ca&s;h, property of one &s;pecies or another. We are now on &s;ure ground, our Trea&s;ury is full and overflowing, but there are difficult times in view, and probably the time is not far di&s;tant when we may want every &s;hilling, and all our re&s;ources may be required to &s;ave the &s;tate from further taxes.</P>
<P>I will take the liberty to draw the attention of the Senate to the &s;tatement made by the defendant in 1788, this mentions the New-Loan debt. <HI>That</HI> being the year preceding the annihilating Act; but from the year 1789 the Legi&s;lature and Comptroller concur that the New-Loans were no longer a debt, or evidence of a debt; whereas they were a part of the &s;tate debt the year before. Whatever may be &s;aid of the views or the objects of the committee on ways and means, the duty of the Comptroller-General was as much to lay the &s;ame &s;tatements before the A&s;&s;embly after the Act of 1789 as it was before, except &s;o far as the &s;ame was varied by the repeal. On the 4th of November 1788, in the Comptroller's &s;tatement, page 7, we have the following entry:&mdash;</P>

<P>In his &s;tatement, November 4, 1787, he mentions the New-Loan debt, but we find no charge of this debt in the &s;tatement of the finances from this officer to the year 1790&mdash;Then the Governor in his &s;peech to the Legi&s;lature, page 43, December 28, gives a &s;tate|ment which is not confined to demands requiring im|mediate payment, but for all the debts for which the &s;tate &s;tands pledged, and mentions <HI>"balance of intere&s;t on the New-Loan certificates."</HI> Here can be no pretence, the whole aggregate of the debts of the commonwealth and only the <HI>balance of intere&s;t on the New-Loan debt.</HI> Where is the defendant's letter to the Governor inform|ing him of his mi&s;take? This &s;uppo&s;es his acquie&s;cence as he did not contradict it; but in a few days after the Comptroller made his report to the A&s;&s;embly, and be|ing the fir&s;t A&s;&s;embly under the con&s;titution, he enu|merated all the debts and gave a hi&s;tory of the finances; if the Governor had made a mi&s;take was it not the Comptroller-General's duty to rectify it? In page 389 of the minutes, the New-Loans are &s;tated expre&s;sly as excluded from redemption, except for the purpo&s;e of being re-exchanged; the Comptroller does not think it of importance to &s;tate what quantity had been re-exchanged, becau&s;e he did not con&s;ider the &s;tate as liable for them.</P>
<P>The Legi&s;lature could not &s;uppo&s;e that the Compt|roller thought the law of 1789 to be void, or the law
<PB N="723" REF="027132_0731_0FD354CE80C7CC70">
of 1786 to be in force, except as to the funds, as he mentions all the items, funded, unfunded, &amp;c.&mdash;and yet with regard to the New-Loan certificates, he &s;tates them as excluded from redemption, except the arrears of intere&s;t.</P>
<P>On the 8th of February 1791 the committee on ways and means reported a &s;tatement of all the debts of the commonwealth, in which they mention all the <HI>claims</HI> and <HI>demands,</HI> an univer&s;al expre&s;&s;ion embracing every &s;pecies of debt; yet where that is expre&s;&s;ed, neither the committee nor the Legi&s;lature con&s;ider the New-Loans as included. The Comptroller-General mu&s;t have been acquainted with the Governor's &s;tatement in December 1790; and with the report abovementioned in February 1791; and if he differs in his &s;tatement therefrom, it is a proof that we are right. On the 30th of November 1791 there was a joint report of Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> Mr. <HI>Donnald&s;on</HI> and Mr. <HI>Febiger,</HI> upon a reference to which <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> proceeded when &s;he prepared the law of the 10th of April 1792. (See appendix to the minutes of that year, the la&s;t page but one.) Here all the claims again&s;t the commonwealth are enumerated, and only the balance of intere&s;t on the New-Loan debt. If we are not determined again&s;t conviction, we mu&s;t believe this to be the true &s;tate of the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s for my own part I am at a lo&s;s to think how language could be le&s;s doubtful and more plain or explicit. A very long cour&s;e of corre&s;pondence was brought forward to &s;hew, that whether ill or well found|ed, the Comptroller thought them &s;ub&s;cribable in De|cember 1791; what circum&s;tances might have induced a change, I cannot tell, &s;ufficient it is that they were not mentioned the 30th November 1790. And on the 30th of December 1791, he &s;hews the Legi&s;lature he was o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a contrary opinion.</P>
<P>I will di&s;mi&s;s this &s;ubject with a few remarks on the conference. Perhaps the attention of the Governor and fi&s;cal officers were never called to the point becau&s;e
<PB N="724" REF="027132_0732_0FD3282E34413E38">
no New-Loans were &s;ub&s;cribed under the fir&s;t loan; under this Act then, the que&s;tion was not fairly litigat|ed, as none were &s;ub&s;cribed. True it is, that the Comptroller in &s;ome conver&s;ations &s;poke of them as being a&s;&s;umable, but it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve that had he communicated the Act of 1789 to Mr. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> his mind would have been clear, and all his doubts would be &s;olved. He never &s;ugge&s;ted to any body, neither in writing nor conver&s;ation, that the New-Loans were redeemable under the Act of the 10th of April 1792.</P>
<P>He had &s;ome conver&s;ation with Mr. <HI>Evans,</HI> in which he &s;tated that the &s;tock was to be &s;old; but never men|tioned to him that the New-Loans were redeemable. Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> &s;ays he went no farther than to &s;ay the Act included unfunded depreciation, and that after|wards when they were &s;ub&s;cribed, he was &s;urpri&s;ed. This &s;hews he de&s;igned to &s;helter him&s;elf under the letter of the law, contrary to what he knew to be the de&s;ign of the Legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>Surprizing, that when he he&s;itated about the depre|ciaton certificates, he did not he&s;itate about the New-Loans! I will di&s;mi&s;s this point, and proceed to the charge which concerns&mdash;WITHDRAWING MONEY FROM THE TREASURY WITHOUT A PREVIOUS APPROPRIATION, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This is proved beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of controver&s;y, the corre&s;pondence between the Comptroller-General and the Governor re&s;pecting the debt to be redeemed, and the &s;tock to be &s;old prove this, for he furni&s;hes an e&s;timate of the whole; here he prevaricates, for be|ing called upon in a general manner he an&s;wers in a re&s;tricted &s;en&s;e, &s;urely it was his duty to render a ju&s;t &s;tatement, but that rendered by him was covert and deceitful, the Governor's proclamation of the 16th of May 1792, which had been &s;hewn to the Comptroller-General, founded on his e&s;timate which enumerated the debts to be redeemed by the Act of 1792, and his not mentioning the error, is a proof that he acknow|ledged the &s;tatement to be right.</P>

<P>(The articles la&s;t mentioned being read, Mr. <HI>Inger&s;oll</HI> proceeded, &s;aying.)&mdash;</P>
<P>Here, Sir, as in the con&s;ideration of the article ju&s;t pa&s;t, are no circum&s;tances to rai&s;e a doubt, no objec|tions to uncon&s;titutionality under the ma&s;k of patrio|ti&s;m. Whatever arguments may be brought up to &s;up|port the redeemability of the New-Loans, here is no pretence; the evidence is &s;o clear that it has forced an acknowledgment. Whenever the holder was willing to &s;urrender to the commonwealth, the Comptroller-General could not deem it improper. When he un|dertook the tru&s;t he knew the terms of it; he was bound to do it under all the ties and &s;olemnities of of|fice. What are the facts? There are in&s;tances, <HI>Biddle's</HI> and <HI>Oldden's.</HI> No doubt can be entertained but his conduct here di&s;appointed the &s;tate of the exchange, which &s;he intended and wi&s;hed to make.</P>
<P>Purcha&s;es in the market would in a degree interfere with the ultimate de&s;ign of his agency. This perhaps would be carrying the rule too far. (Then Mr. <HI>In|ger&s;oll</HI> went over the te&s;timony of Mr. <HI>Oldden</HI> and Mr. <HI>Biddle,</HI> which &s;ee pages 243-4, and 230-40-41.)</P>
<P><PB N="727" REF="027132_0735_0FD3546CB5CAC850">What is <HI>malum in &s;e.</HI> is contrary to the common law, and if it is of notorious evil, is indictable. There is no &s;tatute on the &s;ubject, but an indictment is main|tainable. The property was ve&s;ted in the &s;tate on its delivery to the Comptroller-General; neither party could be off, the indents being tendered or not could make no odds, while the price was uncertain no per&s;on could tell what he had to tender, until the Continental were brought out and the intere&s;t calculated, when they were returned, they were to be cancelled. It was not nece&s;&s;ary to pay the indents to complete the exchange and to ve&s;t the property in the commonwealth. I ap|peal to the gentlemen pre&s;ent, and affirm, that the cer|tificates of <HI>Oldden</HI> could not be recovered from the Comptroller-General by an action of trover, and if burnt or de&s;troyed whil&s;t in his cu&s;tody, would they not be lo&s;t as the property of the &s;tate? The moment they were returned, the commonwealth became a tru&s;tee for him, and Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> was the officer to carry the agreement into execution. (2 <HI>B. C.</HI> 447.)</P>
<P>I might enlarge on this argument by putting many ca&s;es relative to the exchange of hor&s;es, bonds, &amp;c. This I will decline, and mu&s;t acknowledge that I am glad to find my&s;elf &s;o near the end.</P>

<P>THE Senate met, the con&s;ideration of Legi&s;lative bu&s;ine&s;s being po&s;tponed, and the Hou&s;e of Repre|&s;entatives attending as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Morris,</HI> the Speaker, informed the gentlemen concerned in the trial, that it was agreed on by the Senate, that the arguments &s;hould be concluded by, and confined to one gentleman on each &s;ide. After which <HI>Mr. Tilghman aro&s;e and &s;poke as follows</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Senate,</HI></P>
<P>I WILL &s;tate on my part, what appears to me to be the true &s;tate of the ca&s;e, with re&s;pect to the evi|dence. (Mr. <HI>Inger&s;oll</HI> interrupted him, and ob&s;erved, that he had to an&s;wer to the charge re&s;pecting the cer|tificates of <HI>Hans Hamilton;</HI> whereupon Mr. <HI>Tilghman</HI> waved going over the te&s;timony, as he appeared to be about to do, and read the interrogatories of <HI>Hans Ha|milton,</HI> and then the an&s;wers, and afterwards, read the interrogatories and an&s;wers alternately. Mr. <HI>T.</HI> then &s;aid,)&mdash;</P>
<P>The coun&s;el for Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> will re&s;t this bu&s;ine&s;s without any further ob&s;ervations than this, that the whole te&s;timony of <HI>Hans Hamilton,</HI> negatives the in|ference, and repugns the idea of any exchange.</P>
<P><PB N="730" REF="027132_0738_0FD354EB46074A08">Mr. <HI>Rawle</HI> ro&s;e, and &s;aid,</P>
<P>IT falls to my lot to add a few ob&s;ervations on the te&s;timony adduced to prove the charges again&s;t Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on;</HI> and I tru&s;t that it will appear to every clear headed man, that the&s;e charges are amply &s;upported, and that the exchange was negociated for <HI>Hans Hamil|ton</HI> by his agent. It claims peculiar attention, as it confirms one of the mo&s;t &s;erious charges, in which the official delinquency is aggravated by the extreme confi|dence repo&s;ed by the &s;tate in the defendant.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t recal the attention of the Senate to the re|collection of the preliminary introduction of this bu&s;i|ne&s;s by the learned manager, in which it had been &s;tated from the New-Loan book A, (page 129,) that three certificates, No. 4,151, for &pound;. 11:16:0; No. 4,152, for &pound;. 268:0:0; and No. 4,153, for &pound;. 242:7:6, were i&s;&s;ued by the Comptroller-General under the Act of March 1786, in the name of <HI>Hans Hamilton.</HI></P>
<P>From the book of Continental certificates received in exchange for New-Loans (page 230) it appears that &s;undry Continental certificates were received in ex|change for them, agreeing exactly with the total amount of the three former certificates.</P>
<P>It appears by the certificate of the Regi&s;ter of the Trea&s;ury of the United States, dated March 4, 1794, that the Comptroller-General &s;ub&s;cribed each of tho&s;e identical certificates and individual numbers for, and in the name of <HI>Hans Hamilton.</HI> It likewi&s;e appears from the large ab&s;tract, No. 262, that the&s;e identical New-Loan certificates were &s;ub&s;cribed by Mr. <HI>John Nichol&s;on</HI> for his own u&s;e.</P>
<P>It therefore followed from the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, that the property of the &s;tate had been violated, that as &s;he mu&s;t have a property either in the New-Loans emitted, or in the Continental certificates received, as it never could be in <HI>abeyance,</HI> but if it cea&s;es in the one, it mu&s;t at the &s;ame time commence in the other. Either her New-Loans or her Continental certificates had been converted to private purpo&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="731" REF="027132_0739_0FD35470820E0FE0">Time has been applied for and granted, and I tru&s;t the Senate will &s;ee, that the depo&s;ition of <HI>Hans Ha|milton</HI> will be found to clear up the depo&s;ition, and to prove not how far the defendant is innocent, but in what manner he is guilty. It will be proved beyond a controver&s;y, not that neither of them were the property of the commonwealth, but that the New-Loans were. That they were &s;o rendered by an Act which he could only have performed by being Comptroller-General; it will be &s;hewn, that preci&s;ely in the terms of the &s;e|venth article of impeachment, her New-Loans have been fraudulently converted by the Comptroller-Ge|neral to his own private u&s;e and emolument.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, By depo&s;iting Continental certificates under the Act of March 1786, the &s;tate acquired a qualified property in them&mdash;1. For &s;afe-keeping. 2. To re|ceive indents, this property might become ab&s;olute by the holders of New-Loans purcha&s;ing lands.</P>
<P>Secondly, After the 27th of March 1789 the hold|ers of New-Loans had a right to, and acquired a pro|perty in the identical Continental certificates depo&s;ited by them. But this was not always practicable on ac|count of the practice of exchanging, con&s;olidating or cutting up certificates. To remedy, therefore, this in|convenience, other certificates, as the &s;tate had a large &s;hare of her own, were allowed to be returned in &s;uch ca&s;es. This was implied by the Act of March 27, 1789. Like optional powers were given in the in&s;truc|tions of the Supreme Executive Council, (&s;ee page 267) and by an Act of the fir&s;t of April 1790. But where the New-Loans originally i&s;&s;ued, and continued the &s;ame, where the Continental certificates originally depo&s;ited had not been delivered out to others, and where one remained to meet the other, the law and the in&s;tructions required the exchange to be &s;pecific; and it will not be di&s;puted that where there exi&s;ted no ne|ce&s;&s;ity of giving others, the Comptroller-General was to give the &s;ame, and no fair purpo&s;e could be an&s;wered by making it otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="732" REF="027132_0740_0FD354D0993D9FC8">In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance they corre&s;pond preci&s;ely; the original certificates i&s;&s;ued by the United States were depo&s;ited by <HI>Hans Hamilton.</HI> He <HI>Hans Hamilton</HI> had received New-Loan certificates in lieu of them. I tru&s;t then, there can be no doubt under this point of view, but the New-Loan certificates became the property of the commonwealth. (The an&s;wers to the 1&s;t and 2d interrogatories were then read.) If a commutation had been meditated it could be done immediately; How then is this commutation effected? <HI>An&s;.</HI> The Compt|roller-General takes the identical continental certifi|cates, which were depo&s;ited with the &s;tate, and remain|ed in her coffers, and &s;ub&s;cribed them in the name of <HI>Hans Hamilton.</HI> Then, Sir, this was an <HI>unlawful</HI> or a <HI>lawful</HI> act. If it was intended to be &s;ub&s;cribed for his own u&s;e, and not with a view to effectuate the re-ex|change, which <HI>Hamilton</HI> de&s;ired, it was an unlawful and attrocious depredation of public property.</P>
<P>His coun&s;el deny this.&mdash;</P>
<P>Then it was lawful; it was done as Comptroller-General, regularly, officially and con&s;i&s;tently with his duty, to effectuate the exchange, as the obliging friend of <HI>Hans Hamilton,</HI> and the public &s;ervant of <HI>Penn&s;yl|vania!</HI></P>
<P>Then what was the legal re&s;ult? <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> The New-Loans being thus &s;atisfied by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> parties receiving the original continental certificates in the form of funded debt, became again the <HI>property</HI> of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI></P>
<P>This would have been the re&s;ult if only the value or amount in other certificates had been &s;ub&s;cribed, but when the &s;ame continental certificates originally loaned are &s;ub&s;cribed, and that too, after the holders come down to exchange them, and when the Comptroller-General was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the New-Loans. (The an&s;wer to the 1&s;t interrogatory then read.) This an&s;wer &s;hews that tran&s;action was &s;o viewed by <HI>Hans Hamilton</HI> him&s;elf, he viewed no private bargain to ve&s;t the pro|perty of his New-Loans in <HI>John Nichol&s;on</HI> and not in the commonwealth. He con&s;idered it as the effectuat|ing
<PB N="733" REF="027132_0741_0FD3547277424938">
the exchange, under the law of 1789, which he had not time to carry thro' him&s;elf, and little did he, or would any other plain and un&s;kilful man conceive the mon&s;trous idea that by delivering up the property of the &s;tate, a property in the New-Loans could be acquired by the officer.</P>
<P>This appears not to have occured to the Comptroller-General until April 1792. If then the property depo|&s;ited by <HI>Hans Hamilton</HI> actually belongs to the &s;tate, it cannot be the property of <HI>John Nichol&s;on</HI>&mdash;What! my &s;ervant to take my property for the purpo&s;e of pay|ing one of my engagements, and then allege it belongs to him? Notwith&s;tanding all the technical difficulties of the &s;tatute of frauds, if my money is employed to buy a hou&s;e it belongs to me altho' the deed may be in my agent's name; then mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly the property in the certificates in que&s;tion is in the &s;tate. As an agent he received them from <HI>Hans Hamilton;</HI> but as Compt|roller-General, as depo&s;itory of the commonwealth he &s;ub&s;cribed them; or if it is admitted that his &s;ub&s;crib|ing, as Comptroller-General was illegal, he exchanged them as Comptroller-General, and &s;ub&s;cribed them as the friendly agent of <HI>Hans Hamilton.</HI> We are not to be entangled by the acts of the Comptroller-General, he is not to be the agent of <HI>Hans Hamilton</HI> whil&s;t he is act|ing as Comptroller-General of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania;</HI> this double a&s;&s;umption of qualities is improper, but it was only as Comptroller-General he had acce&s;s to the certificates, and the Comptroller-General was very remi&s;s indeed, if he permitted the agent of <HI>Hans Hamilton</HI> to put his fin|gers into the public coffers of the &s;tate; in relation to the New-Loans he cea&s;ed to be the private agent as &s;oon as the continental certificates were &s;ub&s;cribed, for if <HI>Hans Hamilton</HI> had no more right, his agent had not, he had no other duties to perform in regard to them than as Comptroller-General.</P>
<P>What are his duties and powers? They are defined in the Act of the 1&s;t April 1790. It was his duty to deliver them over to the Trea&s;urer to be cancelled; as
<PB N="734" REF="027132_0742_0FD354D1D23C3A68">
Comptroller-General, he had no power but to deliver them over for the above purpo&s;e; what has he done? They remain with him till, April 1792, when <HI>Hans Hamilton</HI> came to town and applied to his agent for the funded debt. (The defendant's 3d interrogatory and an&s;wer then read) I will not a&s;k, Sir, why during this interval, the New-Loans were depo&s;ited with the Compt|roller-General, after the continental certificates had been funded and were not delivered to be cancelled, why the indents were not adju&s;ted, nor in &s;hort, why he did not perform his official duty in re&s;pect to them. The New-Loans, as well as the funded &s;tock remained in his hands during this period; he confirms the tran&s;ac|tion by receiving the intere&s;t; the continental certificates had been taken out of the trunk of the Comptroller-General&mdash;two things were then done.&mdash;1. <HI>Hans Hamil|ton</HI> lo&s;t his right to the New-Loans.&mdash;2. <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> lo&s;t her continental certificates.&mdash;What did <HI>Hans Ha|milton</HI> receive? Funded &s;tock. What did the common|wealth receive? A blank.</P>
<P>(Seventh article then read.) I &s;ay, this te&s;timony is fuller than that of Mr. <HI>M'Clenachan. Hans Hamilton</HI> is an hone&s;t man; but we find the depo&s;ition turns out different from what they expected. I do not find that they prevailed in obtaining an expo&s;ition to their mind. An&s;wers come out which the defendant did not expect. In all his interrogatories to the deponent, he mention|ed nothing of <HI>an agent</HI>&mdash;he mentioned an <HI>obligation</HI>&mdash; and what became of it? Yet we find that <HI>Hamilton</HI> calls it an agency. <HI>Hans Hamilton</HI> had an&s;wered hone&s;tly. The <HI>exparte</HI> depo&s;ition did not corrupt him. All his an&s;wers fully confirm the charge, and come literally within the &s;eventh article. I will add no more; what|ever doubts may be entertained el&s;ewhere, here are no judicial &s;peculations;&mdash;Acts of A&s;&s;embly have been violated&mdash;the law is clear&mdash;and the facts are well &s;up|ported.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tilghman</HI> ro&s;e in reply, and &s;aid,</P>
<P>I AM glad the coun&s;el who &s;poke la&s;t hath not em|barra&s;&s;ed
<PB N="735" REF="027132_0743_0FD354ECC2F0A7B0">
the que&s;tion to bring us to an&s;wer a charge brought again&s;t us by the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives. There is a way of attempting a thing, by communi|cating it in a gentle manner, when a man is willing to &s;trike. I will leave it to the Senate whether the hint that is intended for the defendant, is worthy of tho&s;e who brought it forward. Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on's</HI> conduct has ever been open and manly, and he mu&s;t be acquitted of any de&s;ign derogatory of that character.</P>
<P>Then I take the que&s;tion &s;olemnly to be, whether Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> acted in the line of his official duty, and whether he received tho&s;e certificates from <HI>Hans Ha|milton</HI> for the purpo&s;e of being exchanged? I take this to be a naked que&s;tion of fact. I agree that a gentle|man may act in two capacities. It hath been &s;aid that Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> acted in two capacities. Was he le&s;s &s;edulous for acting in the two-fold capacity of <HI>John Ni|chol&s;on,</HI> and Comptroller-General? That he acted for <HI>Hans Hamilton</HI> as <HI>John Nichol&s;on</HI> and not as Comptrol|ler-General, and his doing or acting as agent for <HI>Hans Hamilton</HI> could not become a crime as <HI>Comptroller-General;</HI> no man could be prevented from acting as an agent for another unle&s;s re&s;trained by po&s;itive laws. While he acted as Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> he is not liable to impeachment, I call upon the gentlemen to &s;tate where he acted as Comptroller-General in this affair? I con|&s;ider it was lawful for him to act as a private citizen, without being impeachable before this honorable tribu|nal. I will not take the time to run over the an&s;wers of <HI>Hans Hamilton,</HI> he did not act in his official capacity, but he had been friendly, Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI> &s;aid, "all I want is &s;tock of the United States, I leave the&s;e certi|ficates with you for that purpo&s;e," while he acted as Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> he is not liable to impeachment, I will take it for granted that Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> was the agent of <HI>Hans Hamilton,</HI> even, I will take it for granted, that Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> was mi&s;taken&mdash;&s;o far I take it for granted, that he has paid <HI>Hans Hamilton</HI> what <HI>Hamilton</HI> wi&s;hed to have; by lodging tho&s;e very certificates with Mr. <HI>Smith</HI>
<PB N="736" REF="027132_0744_0FD354EEE8489770">
the continental Loan-officer, which <HI>Hamilton</HI> afterwards received. Here then is the candor of the defendant. Nay more, he received double the amount; and, here is venality charged again&s;t him in profu&s;ion! This does not favour their arguments, that he u&s;ed the con|tinental certificates improperly, but it is what the logi|cians call a <HI>non &s;equitur.</HI></P>
<P>He applied to Mr. Nichol&s;on as a friend not as an officer; does he come to Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> and &s;ay, I wi&s;h to unite the characters of Agent and Comptroller-Ge|neral? No, Sir, he negatives all official communica|tions.&mdash;But again the gentlemen &s;ay, how could the Comptroller be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>The gentlemen them&s;elves have &s;tated, that it was not e&s;&s;ential to have the very identical ones, and the laws and in&s;tructions point out that their co-relatives could not always be at hand, that the practice was otherwi&s;e, at which many were much agitated, nay, offended, becau&s;e they could not have their own re|turned to them.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t beg the indulgence of the Senate, whil&s;t I'll ob&s;erve, that Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> was a holder of New-Loans to a con&s;iderable amount, why then as it is agreed that it is a &s;pecies of criminality, if a doubt remains re&s;|pecting the&s;e certificates, Why does not the doubt operate in favour of the defendant? Why not pre&s;ume him innocent in &s;ome of the&s;e in&s;tances? Why not pre&s;ume, that Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> obtained them &s;ome other way, by &s;ome exchange, or purcha&s;e of &s;ome other per&s;on? In either ca&s;e Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> is far from guilt. Does <HI>Hans Hamilton</HI> &s;ay his continental certificates were returned? No.</P>
<P>The gentlemen have a&s;&s;umed the ba&s;is and rea&s;oned ingenuou&s;ly and &s;ubtilly that the&s;e continental certificates were in the coffers of the &s;tate, they have not trod ten|derly on the Act of 1786; but let them not collect cri|minality from &s;urmi&s;es, let them prove it, if the fact is capable of proof; that it was the property of <HI>Penn&s;yl|vania</HI> at that time, then one of two things mu&s;t be the
<PB N="737" REF="027132_0745_0FD328300EF49530">
con&s;equence, either it follows that the Comptroller-Ge|neral was exce&s;&s;ively blameable by affecting to act as Comptroller-General; but in the mean time made u&s;e of his official advantages, and acted &s;o as to be highly criminal.&mdash;Or that di&s;robing him&s;elf of his charac|ter, intruded his ra&s;h and &s;acrilegious hands into the coffers of the &s;tate! One or the other of the&s;e mu&s;t be the ca&s;e!</P>
<P>Has the pro&s;ecution altogether re&s;ted with the Comp|troller-General? Have they a right to impeach the Comptroller and not to arraign <HI>Hans Hamilton?</HI> Do they not con&s;ider him charged? The evidence being that the tran&s;action was of a private nature, and that he act|ed as the agent of <HI>Hans Hamilton.</HI> Where the Senate can make a favourable con&s;truction it is their duty nay it is not only their duty, but it is agreeable to their &s;en&s;ations. But when it appears from <HI>Hans Hamilton's</HI> depo&s;itions, that no continental certificates were ever delivered to him, how is the inference to be drawn without any pre|mi&s;es to &s;upport it? But the ca&s;e &s;tands &s;imply thus, We are charged with taking the New-Loan certificates of the &s;tate which had been exchanged by the &s;tate and applying them to our u&s;e.</P>
<P>What is the proof? Is there a particle of evidence in <HI>Hans Hamilton's</HI> depo&s;ition to &s;hew that the&s;e were ever exchanged? <HI>No.</HI> Is there even a &s;hadow of proof to &s;hew that they had ever been pre&s;ented for &s;uch ex|change to the &s;tate? <HI>No. Hans Hamilton</HI> did not do it as he tells you upon oath, nor did he direct it to be done, and <HI>Hans Hamilton's</HI> te&s;timony is full and clear in our favour: Here we might re&s;t the cau&s;e without replying to any charges not in the impeachment.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid, if this was not done, we mu&s;t have taken the continental certificates, for which the&s;e had originally been loaned, for that, on turning to the book of continental certificates loaned which we have kept, and the ab&s;tract of continental certificates in the Trea|&s;ury office of the United States and comparing the one with the other, they agree in dates and &s;ums, altho'
<PB N="738" REF="027132_0746_0FD354F1D49D11B0">
we are not bound to reply to this a&s;per&s;ion until we are charged by the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives with <HI>&s;eque&s;i|ring continental certificates the property of the &s;tate,</HI> yet I will ob&s;erve, 1. That to this compari&s;on of dates and &s;ums &s;hould be added another book, that of their re-exchange, whereby the &s;tate became dive&s;ted of the&s;e continental certificates; here, you will find exchanges entered which were made for Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> and cor|re&s;ponding in dates and intere&s;t as &s;ufficient to identify the re-exchange, as the former doth the exchange; for the dates of intere&s;t, their amounts, and numbers are all that were recorded in either ca&s;e, in the&s;e books which were directed in their form, by, and occa&s;ionally &s;ubmitted to the Supreme Executive Council. Nor is this all, there are other exchanges the &s;ums and dates of intere&s;t of which would apply to the&s;e certifi|cates, and Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> might have bought them of others, who had previou&s;ly exchanged them, but it is difficult to account for any tran&s;action without a motive, and here there was no motive of intere&s;t to urge the Comptroller to lay his hands on the&s;e certi|ficates, the property of the &s;tate, they were no better than a like amount of any other &s;uch continental cer|tificates, and yet he was obliged to account for every dollar of the&s;e certificates in his hands, and pay over to the State-Trea&s;urer &s;uch amounts as were not ex|changed, &s;o that, as the &s;tate could not lo&s;e on the one hand he being re&s;pon&s;ible, &s;o neither could he have gained on the other.</P>
<P>La&s;tly. If it &s;hould be imputed to us that we have dealt unfairly by <HI>Hans Hamilton,</HI> for our conduct will bear the te&s;t in every view, either as an officer, or as an individual, we &s;hew clearly from his te&s;timony, that he was fully &s;atisfied and hath got what he a&s;ked for, the certificates he thus wanted and received from Mr. <HI>Nichol|&s;on,</HI> were not granted by the Comptroller-General, but by the United States. In this tran&s;action therefore, we not only did not act officially, but the bu&s;ine&s;s was not

to be tran&s;acted at all in the office where the mal-practice is charged.</P>
<P>In conclu&s;ion I be&s;eech the Senate to con&s;ider, that mi&s;erable and wretched indeed mu&s;t be the condition of officers it impeachments can be found where there is no offence again&s;t the law. A book of high e&s;timation &s;ays, NO LAW, NO TRANSGRESSION.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Rawle</HI> ro&s;e, and replied&mdash;</P>
<P>I DO not wonder that the Comptroller-General &s;hould be defended with &s;o much ingenuity, and I am willing to ju&s;tify his coun&s;el for combining every ne|ce&s;&s;ary qualification and in &s;electing all the pathetic pa&s;&s;ages; and am al&s;o willing to do ju&s;tice to my own feelings at the expence of my judgment; for I think we have nothing to do with the la&s;t, but I will leave him to that &s;ingle plank oh which he is to be &s;aved from total ruin. There is but one main argument, and that is, Who is impeached? and whether the Compt|roller is of a moral or a civil &s;pecies of exi&s;tence? E|very &s;pecies of offence is committed by the man; yes, by the man who holds the office. How then is a line to be drawn, between the man and the officer? The man has offended, and the officer is innocent! One of tho&s;e offences come in virtue of his holding the office, therefore it did not become him to purcha&s;e. If he had been a private individual, another tribunal would be the proper one, and as &s;uch he could not be entitled to &s;uch a &s;olemn trial as the pre&s;ent. (Mr. <HI>Rawle</HI> then
<PB N="742" REF="027132_0750_0FD3282CC7371B60">
read &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages from 2 <HI>Woodi&s;on,</HI> page 602.) Here the Lord-Chancellor of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> was found guilty of bribery, one of the mo&s;t exalted judges; agreeably to the arguments of the learned coun&s;el for the defend|ant, he &s;hould not be impeached as Lord-Chancellor, but as a man. If Judges, if Privy-Coun&s;ellors and a Lord-Chancellor&mdash;and he too, a confidential advi&s;er of his &s;overeign, is impeached, and the&s;e circum&s;tances are not unlike the pre&s;ent, how much more proper it mu&s;t be here, where trials by impeachment are embo|died into our Con&s;titution. When Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI> was applied to officially, he an&s;wered, that he applied pri|vately to Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> to be his agent. Had he ap|plied to Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> to make the exchange, he would no doubt have done it; there is no law on this &s;ubject, it would be a whole&s;ome thing to make a law for &s;uch a purpo&s;e. It would ea&s;e a great deal of this embar|ra&s;&s;ment.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid that as a private man, Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> is not liable to impeachment. That remains unproved. It is not to be pre&s;umed that he acquired a right by any &s;ub&s;equent tran&s;action;&mdash;we have no light to guide us in the&s;e particulars, but <HI>Hamilton</HI> employed <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> his agent&mdash;it was for his u&s;e and for his benefit;&mdash;Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> made u&s;e of his naked authority as an agent. Hence the offence of acting as Comptroller-General for the commonwealth, and acting as agent for <HI>Hans Hamil|ton</HI> is inferred.</P>
<P>Let us now put this in the mo&s;t favorable point of view, and admit, that Mr. <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> owned the&s;e New-Loan certificates, or that he purcha&s;ed them before they had been owned by <HI>Hans Hamilton.</HI> If he tran&s;acted the bu&s;ine&s;s which he afterwards did, laying <HI>Hans Ha|milton</HI> entirely out of the que&s;tion, &s;till the heavy char|ges remain. Let us then hear no more of <HI>Hans Hamil|ton;</HI> let us infer from no pre&s;umption; we will take <HI>Hans Hamilton's</HI> te&s;timony and the official tran&s;action. The gentleman hath &s;ugge&s;ted nothing to prove that
<PB N="743" REF="027132_0751_0FD354F80605AFE0">
the Continental certificates were out and cea&s;ed to be|come the property of the &s;tate in September 1791.</P>
<P>A &s;ingular and romantic co-incidence of &s;ums and dates, that it &s;hould again have come round, the iden|tical Continental certificates were the property of the commonwealth in 1786, and of <HI>John Nichol&s;on</HI> in 1791. We have proved that they were depo&s;ited in 1786; then if once in the cu&s;tody of the &s;tate, on whom is it incumbent to &s;hew, that they did not remain &s;o? From whom is the information to come? From none, but from him&s;elf!</P>
<P>Are we then under all the&s;e circum&s;tances to prove that they remained in the cu&s;tody of the &s;tate? It is not by the aid of pre&s;umption, not by getting a &s;tride of probability and galloping off, that we prove this. But we are told by <HI>Hans Hamilton,</HI> that they were not ex|changed. But it is &s;aid, that exchange may inadvertently be taken for commutation, that in any dictionary you would find them convertible terms, and that their ap|plication is the &s;ame. Take it either way it is &s;ub&s;tan|tially the &s;ame: By that exchange it was to be convert|ed by the Comptroller-General into debt of the United States. Let us &s;uppo&s;e it either way, let us &s;uppo&s;e it to be converted to &s;tock of the United States pre|viou&s;ly &s;ub&s;cribed. Then the charge remains, the form is only altered, the offence is the &s;ame, the certifi|cates are purcha&s;ed of <HI>Hans Hamilton;</HI> but to have it as the te&s;timony runs, there is an exchange in view, this gentleman is the agent, and agreeably to the exi&s;t|ing laws he tran&s;acts the bu&s;ine&s;s which no man in <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania</HI> could do but the Comptroller-General.</P>
<P>One more word about pre&s;umption, and that is, in favour of innocence. They &s;ay, <HI>"Why do you not prove him criminal?"</HI> We deem it fully &s;o. Here is a tor|tuous and wr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ngful depredation of property. He is not to &s;ay, the charge is not &s;upported by pre&s;umption without te&s;timony, as pre&s;umption is di&s;regarded in dealings. There is no circum&s;tances in this tran&s;action which I do not conceive of importance. Whether the
<PB N="744" REF="027132_0752_0FD354A790B65200">
certificates with which he is charged were more or le&s;s than tho&s;e brought to him for the purpo&s;e of being exchang|ed; it is &s;ufficient for us that he is charged with tho&s;e, the tran&s;actions are traced and the accu&s;ation is proved, the&s;e bloody and my&s;terious volumes of arbitrary and let our proof be oppo&s;ed to his matter of defence. It is not to be con&s;idered that he did &s;o with all others.</P>
<P>I will detain the Senate no longer, I have concluded my arguments&mdash;the gentleman has advanced the ca&s;e of lord <HI>Strafford</HI>&mdash;How is that like the pre&s;ent ca&s;e? What analogy? He was one of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed and amiable of men without an imputation of vice; Is it upon con&s;truction of municipal laws which are not generally known that the pre&s;ent impeachment is found|ed, is this a law concealed, is it a law unknown, as <HI>Straf|ford's</HI> trea&s;ons? No, we have this law in our nature, it is a monitor, which no man can e&s;cape, as <HI>Cicero</HI> calls it, <HI>Lex.non &s;cripta, &s;ed nata, quam non didicimus, &s;ed accepimus</HI>&mdash;not received at &s;chool, but grew with life, again&s;t that law there is no &s;tatute. It is in po&s;itive te&s;timony that the Comptroller-General had offended, and I appeal to this honorable court, that were there no other charge again&s;t him, and all other accu&s;ations for the injured intere&s;t of the commonwealth done away, he ought to be held up as a public example, that no &s;tation in life &s;hall deter the hands of ju&s;tice, nor no labours will be &s;pared, that others may be deterred from violating her tru&s;ts in &s;imilar &s;tations, and that the virtue and integrity of this republic will not bear official treachery.</P>

<P>"A prote&s;t again&s;t the Re&s;olution for taking up, by &s;pecial order, for a &s;econd reading, a re&s;olution which was moved and &s;econded for the appointment of a com|mittee to draught an addre&s;s to the Governor for the removal of <HI>John Nichol&s;on</HI> from the office of Comptrol|ler-General of this commonwealth.</P>
<P><PB N="766" REF="027132_0774_0FD3547B548AAEA8">"WE DISSENT, becau&s;e,</P>
<P>"AT the time of the &s;aid re&s;olution being agreed to, the &s;aid <HI>John Nichol&s;on</HI> &s;tood impeached by the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, <HI>in their name, and in that of all the People of Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> of certain high crimes and mi&s;demeanors in the di&s;charge of his official duties; and as no judgment had been rendered, the &s;aid im|peachment was &s;till depending, and within the power of the Senate: We therefore con&s;ider the adoption of the re&s;olution at that time as an infraction of the law, no le&s;s oppre&s;&s;ive to the defendant than dangerous to the &s;ecurity of individuals; as derogatory to the ju&s;tice and dignity of this Hou&s;e, and as highly di&s;re&s;pectful to the Senate and Governor of the Commonwealth.</P>
<P><HI>"As an infraction of the law, no le&s;s oppre&s;&s;ive to the defendant than dangerous to the &s;ecurity of individuals,</HI> becau&s;e their &s;afety and &s;ecurity depend on the pure and impartial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice; and every thing which has a tendency to prejudice the public mind or to bias the Judges while a cau&s;e is depending, poi&s;ons the &s;prings of ju&s;tice, warps their &s;teady and even cour&s;e, and undermines the mo&s;t valuable bulwark of &s;ecurity, which innocence can have. Hence it is that all publica|tions, touching a cau&s;e depending, which are calculated to give a bias either way, are highly criminal.</P>
<P>"If anonymous publications are con&s;idered as of this dangerous tendency, we conceive that a &s;olemn vote by the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, <HI>"in their name, and in that of all the people of Penn&s;yvania,"</HI> mu&s;t be of a tendency equally dangerous. It is true, it may not have all the intended effect, yet &s;ince that is owing to the virtue and firmne&s;s of others, it affords no apology for the impru|dence of &s;uch a mea&s;ure. Whatever might be the mo|tives, its tendency certainly was to prejudice the public mind while a pro&s;ecution was depending, and to bear down and oppre&s;s the accu&s;ed, by a&s;&s;ailing the minds of his judges with all the weight and influence of the mo&s;t numerous branch of the Legi&s;lature; and, as if this was really intended, care was taken to introduce
<PB N="767" REF="027132_0775_0FD354B1D029A260">
the re&s;olution, with a declaration that <HI>John Nichol&s;on</HI> had, by conduct unworthy of his tru&s;t, forfeited and lo&s;t the confidence of the citizens of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania;</HI> thereby rendering it highly improper that he &s;hould any longer continue to enjoy any office of tru&s;t or profit in this commonwealth. As publications of this nature by an individual, while a pro&s;ecution was depending, would be highly criminal; and as the Hou&s;e of Repre|&s;entatives had fulfilled their con&s;titutional duty by im|peaching and pro&s;ecuting the Comptroller; and as it remained for the &s;enate to di&s;charge their con&s;titutional duty by determining on that impeachment, and for the Governor to di&s;charge his con&s;titutional duty by di&s;plac|ing the Comptroller, or continuing him in office, at lea&s;t till judgment &s;hould be given by the Senate, we can conceive no apology for pa&s;&s;ing the re&s;olution at that time. For the&s;e rea&s;ons we cannot but con&s;ider the re&s;o|lution as an infraction of the law, no le&s;s oppre&s;&s;ive to the accu&s;ed than danegerous to the &s;ecurity of others.</P>
<P>"We al&s;o con&s;ider it as derogatory to the ju&s;tice and dignity of this Hou&s;e. Derogatory to its ju&s;tice for the rea&s;ons already mentioned; and to its dignity, from the ardor and precipitancy with which it was hurried through the Hou&s;e. We &s;ay ardor and precepitancy, becau&s;e, during the debate, a communication was received by the Speaker, from the Clerk of the Senate, that on the next day judgment on the impeachment would be pronounc|ed, and yet without waiting even till the me&s;&s;age was read, or announced from the chair, the re&s;olution was by &s;pecial order taken up, read a &s;econd time, and pa&s;&s;ed in oppo&s;ition to all endeavours for a &s;hort delay. This we believe to be unexampled in Legi&s;lative bodies; and it appears to us to be the more exceptional, &s;ince a decent regard for the opinions of men &s;eemed to require that the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, being the accu&s;ers and pro&s;e|cutors of the Comptroller, &s;hould have manife&s;ted their moderation and impartiality, by declining to u&s;urp the province of judging on their own charges, at lea&s;t until con&s;titutional judges had determined on them. On the
<PB N="768" REF="027132_0776_0FD3547DAE41FAE0">
contrary, as no time for con&s;ideration or enquiry was al|lowed, there is too much rea&s;on to believe that the pro|ceeding will be viewed by impartial men, as partaking more of &s;udden or di&s;appointed re&s;entment, than of that ju&s;t and dignified di&s;plea&s;ure which becomes the Re|pre&s;entatives of a great Republic.</P>
<P>"We have &s;aid of judging on their own charges, be|cau&s;e it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e the an&s;wer, conveyed by the re&s;olution, is founded on the matters charged in the articles of impeachment. It is true it is expre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch general and indefinite terms, as to render it im|po&s;&s;ible to &s;ay whether it is grounded on them or indeed on any thing el&s;e, &s;ince it contains no &s;pecification of facts, nor the lea&s;t hint of any particular matter to which it relates; but as the Comptroller has not been called upon to an&s;wer any other charges than tho&s;e which are men|tioned in the articles of impeachment, nor had an op|portunity of being heard in his defence, we are unwil|ling to &s;uppo&s;e any member of this Hou&s;e capable of condemning him without a charge, and unheard on any other grounds.</P>
<P>"We have &s;aid that we con&s;ider the adoption of the re|&s;olution at that time as highly di&s;re&s;pectful to the Senate and to the Governor. As highly di&s;re&s;pectful to the Se|nate, ina&s;much as it relates to a pro&s;ecution depending before them, and is expre&s;&s;ed in terms calculated to in|fluence their deci&s;ion. <HI>The time, the manner and the ex|treme hurry with which it was ha&s;tened forward,</HI> mu&s;t carry to the minds of the Senate too &s;trong evidence of a &s;uppo&s;ition prevailing in this Hou&s;e, that the Senate or &s;ome of its members, were not to be tru&s;ted with a deci&s;ion, until they were influenced by a &s;olemn re&s;olu|tion that <HI>"John Nichol&s;on</HI> had, by conduct unworthy of his tru&s;t, forfeited and lo&s;t the confidence of the citizens of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> thereby rendering it highly improper that he &s;hould any longer continue to enjoy any office of tru&s;t or profit in this commonwealth."</P>
<P>"And when we take into con&s;ideration the time of pa&s;&s;ing the re&s;olution, we cannot but con&s;ider it as equal|ly
<PB N="769" REF="027132_0777_0FD354BE8962E888">
di&s;re&s;pectful to the Governor, &s;ince it &s;trongly im|plies either that he had neglected his duty by not having already di&s;placed the Comptroller, or that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was appre|hended he would neglect it in future by continuing him in office. While we admit the rights of the Hou&s;e to addre&s;s the Governor, to remove an unworthy officer, we are far from agreeing that the Governor was to blame in not removing the Comptroller after the charges were brought again&s;t him, and while they were depending; &s;ince this would have amounted to a declaration on his put, that the Comptroller was unworthy of tru&s;t and confidence, before either his innocence or guilt had ap|peared on a fair trial. If after a deci&s;ion by the Senate the Governor had continued the Comptroller in office, this I loo&s;e had thought him unworthy of it, there might have been a propriety in addre&s;&s;ing for his removal; but to do this at a time when the Governor could not with pro|priety di&s;place him, when it was known that the difficul|ty would on the next day be removed, appears too much like converting the right of addre&s;&s;ing into a vehicle of general and unqualified cen&s;ure, both upon the officer who may have incurred the di&s;plea&s;ure of the Hou&s;e, and upon the Governor for not adding his weight to that di&s;|plea&s;ure or cen&s;ure, by di&s;placing the accu&s;ed before his modern <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o or guile had been e&s;tabli&s;hed on a fair trial. Under this view of the matter, we cannot but con&s;ider the proceedings again&s;t which we prote&s;t, as an u&s;urpa|tion of incon&s;titutional and arbitrary power, and an at|tempt to di&s;franchi&s;e a citizen, by voting him <HI>unworthy of any office of tru&s;t or profit.</HI></P>
<P>"Under the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, we prote&s;t again&s;t the re&s;o|lution referred to, and have recorded our rea&s;ons in ju&s;ti|fication of our conduct.</P>

<P>"Mr. <HI>Benjamin Morgan,</HI> in behalf of him&s;elf and others, a&s;ked and obtained leave to enter their Reply to the Prote&s;t of the minority of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;enta|tives again&s;t taking up by &s;pecial order for a &s;econd read|ing a re&s;olution for the appointment of a committee to draft an Addre&s;s to the Governor for the removal of <HI>John Nichol&s;on,</HI> Comptroller-General of this commonwealth, on the Journal of the Hou&s;e; and pre&s;ented the &s;ame to the chair, which is follows, viz.</P>
<P>"Reply to the Prote&s;t of the minority of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives again&s;t taking up, by &s;pecial order, for a &s;econd reading, a Re&s;olution for the appointment of a committee to draught an addre&s;s to the Governor for the removal of <HI>John Nichol&s;on,</HI> Comptroller-General of this commonwealth.</P>
<P>"THAT at the time of pa&s;&s;ing the &s;aid re&s;olution, the Senate had decided on the Articles of Impeachment again&s;t the &s;aid <HI>John Nichol&s;on,</HI> Comptroller-General of this common wealth; and although they had neither pro|nounced judgment nor convicted the &s;aid <HI>John Nichol&s;on</HI> on any of the articles exhibited again&s;t him, yet &s;o large a proportion as ten out of &s;eventeen, (the whole number of Senators pre&s;ent) having declared him guilty on two of the mo&s;t &s;erious of the &s;aid articles, it would have been highly improper in the Legi&s;lature not to have made u&s;e of every lawful means, to prevent him from continuing a moment longer in office. Had they acted otherwi&s;e, it would in their apprehen&s;ion have been an unpardonable breach of the confidence repo&s;ed in them by their con&s;tituents; nor could they have expected their vote on the &s;aid re&s;olution would have any &s;uch influence on the deci&s;ion of the Senate, as is &s;ugge&s;ted in the &s;aid prote&s;t; the &s;aid deci&s;ion having previou&s;ly taken place; and though not directly communicated to the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, mu&s;t have been as well known to the minority as it was to the other mem|bers of that Hou&s;e. On this ground alone, we con&s;i|der

the &s;aid vote and re&s;olution not only ju&s;tifiable but nece&s;&s;ary, even had there been no other cau&s;es of re|moval than tho&s;e contained in the Articles of Impeach|ment.</P>

<P>"There is &s;ome difficulty in reconciling the differ|ent objections offered by the prote&s;ting minority; the principal part of which re&s;t on the &s;uppo&s;ed influence the re&s;olution would produce in the deci&s;ion of the Se|nate, when that minority &s;tate in their prote&s;t it&s;elf, that before any vote had been taken on the &s;aid re&s;o|lution, an official communication was received from the Senate, informing the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives that on the next day judgment would be pronounced on the impeachment, which could only be the con&s;e|quence of a deci&s;ion having previou&s;ly taken place.</P>
