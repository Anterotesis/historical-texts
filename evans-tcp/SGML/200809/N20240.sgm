<HEAD>ACCOUNT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 4th day of March, 1794, the brig Falmouth &s;ailed from Port-Royal, Jamaica, bound to Belfa&s;t, in Ireland, to which place &s;he belonged. At the time &s;he &s;ailed, the following per&s;ons were on board:</P>
<P>William Corran ma&s;ter, Francis Turner mate, Henry Gilmore, J. Douthard, &mdash; Boyd, &mdash; Carrol, Jo&s;eph York, (mariners) William Willams, a cabin-boy, Jo&s;eph Porter, a pa&s;&s;enger, and a black, &s;ervant to mr. Porter.</P>
<P>Nothing materially happened on the voyage, 'till two of the hands, Boyd, and Carrol, were taken &s;ick, and died apparently of violent fevers, the one immediately after the other.&mdash;During their illne&s;s, the captain u&s;ed to enquite after their &s;ituation, and to look at them down the hatchway, and &s;ent them frequently from the cabin both &s;oup and coffee.</P>
<P>After the death of the&s;e men, which happened pre|vious to the 2d of May, there appeared an apparent dif|ference in the conduct of the captain, which &s;hewed it|&s;elf in particular in&s;tances of har&s;h treatment towards one or other of the crew, whom he charged with an
<PB N="5" REF="026534_0004_0FD08FFBDFBC34E0">
intention to poi&s;on him and to run away with the ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>Very &s;oon after the death of the man, they &s;poke an American &s;chooner, the ma&s;ter of which captain Cor|ran had before been acquainted with; and who, on hear|ing that he had lo&s;t two of his men, offered to &s;upply him with two more. Captain Corran thanked the Ame|rican for his friend&s;hip, but told him he would endea|vour to do with the hands he had. This circum&s;tance appeared &s;trange to the crew, as the lo&s;s of the men had rendered them but weak-handed.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd of May, he took from the mate a qua|drant, which he had given to him &s;oon after their &s;ail|ing; and likewi&s;e took from him his books of naviga|tion; taking into his own hands the entire navigation of the ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>Mr. Porter, the pa&s;&s;enger, was in an extreme ill &s;tate of health, and was &s;o feeble as to be confined to his bed, which was in the &s;tarboard &s;tate room. In this &s;ituation he lay till the 24th of May, when the mate, being in the larboard &s;tate-room, and the captain and mr. Porter's &s;ervant in the cabin, the mate heard captain Corran, in warm language, abu&s;ing mr. Porter, &mdash;&s;wearing that he &s;hould not &s;tay any longer in the &s;tate room, and ordering his black boy to go immediately and bring his ma&s;ter in|to the cabin. This the boy attempted; but finding him|&s;elf unable to effect it, and mr. Porter, at the &s;ame time, begging, for God's &s;ake, that he might be &s;uffered to lay where he was, the captain entered the &s;tate-room, and, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the black boy, took mr. Porter, by force, out of his bed, and &s;upporting him him&s;elf under one arm, and the black boy under the other, they brought him into the cabin, (he being unable to walk him&s;elf) and &s;at him down in a chair. The captain then ordered the black boy to bring out his ma&s;ter's bed, and make it up in the cabin, upon two che&s;ts belonging to mr. Porter.&mdash; This being done, he compelled the black boy to lay his ma&s;ter on the bed, and then &s;ent for one of the top-gal|lant
<PB N="6" REF="026534_0005_0FD08FFD2EB0D9B0">
&s;tudding &s;ails, of which he made a &s;ort of a curtain to &s;urround the bed. After this tran&s;action, he ordered the black boy out of the cabin, and going upon deck, gave general orders that neither the black boy nor any other per&s;on, &s;hould come into the cabin without his leave, and that no per&s;on &s;hould concern him&s;elf with mr. Por|ter, as he would take care of him him&s;elf.</P>
<P>On the night of the 26th of May, about midnight, the captain &s;ent for the cabin boy; the boy came to him, and the captain ordered him to fetch a candle; after he had brought it, he demanded of the boy where he had been? the boy replied, it was his watch below: He then ordered him to &s;trip off his jacket, after which he bid him go to the locker and bring the cat-o'-nine-tails.&mdash;The boy went to the locker, and told the captain he could not find it: He threatened to &s;trike him with a cutla&s;s, if he did not find it immediately; the boy not being able to find it, he accordingly &s;truck him with the flat of his cutla&s;s. After which he took a pair of hand|cuffs out of a drawer in the cabin, and put it upon the boy's hands. He then put a pi&s;tol to his brea&s;t, and threatened to &s;hoot him. After &s;ome little time, the boy took the fir&s;t opportunity to make his e&s;cape out of the cabin, and as he ran acro&s;s the deck, he de&s;ired the man at the helm, if the captain enquired for him, to tell him, that he had jumped overboard. The boy ran forward, got into the hold, and hid him&s;elf for three days, &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting on &s;ome Indian corn and &s;ugar, which he found in the hold. Immediately after the boy left the cabin, the captain fired his pi&s;tols through the cabin windows, and &s;hattered them con&s;iderably.</P>
<P>The 27th of May, between the hours of 10 and 11 o'clock at night, the captain called Henry Gilmore, and ordered him to bring a light. When Gilmore came with the light, the captain gave him a drink of grog, and told him that he hoped he would be in his favour, and that he was not afraid of the law. Gilmore replied, that
<PB N="7" REF="026534_0006_0FD08FFD54A19208">
he did not wi&s;h to be again&s;t him or any per&s;on. &mdash;The captain &s;oon after came upon deck, and de&s;ired that no per&s;on &s;hould be permitted to come into the cabin, without orders from him, and that the watch, then on deck, &s;hould give the &s;ame charge to the watch which was to &s;ucceed. About a quarter pa&s;t 12 o'clock the whole crew were alarmed with the cries of mr. Porter, ex|claming "Murder! Murder! &amp;c"&mdash;through a hole in the bulk-head, which parted the &s;teerage from the cabin; and by looking down the companion-door, &s;everal of the crew &s;aw captain Corran &s;triking at mr. Porter as he lay in his bed, with a cutla&s;s. After &s;triking him for &s;ome time, he de&s;i&s;ted for a &s;hort &s;pace, and coming up the companion ladder, began to abu&s;e mr. Porter, d&mdash;ing him, and declaring he was not worth five pounds in the world. He then returned into the cabin again, and began to cut mr. Porter as he had done before.&mdash;Mr. Porter again cried out and begged the captain not to cut him &s;o&mdash;to take a pi&s;tol and &s;hoot him. He d&mdash;d him, and &s;aid he would not &s;hoot him, but would cut him every half hour till day light. In a &s;hort time, mr. Porter begged him to de&s;i&s;t, as he was dying; and it is &s;uppo&s;ed that he expired about this time, as his cries were heard no more. Between one and two o'clock the captain came again upon deck, with a cutla&s;s in his hand, and &s;truck mr. Porter's black boy acro&s;s the &s;houlders, and bid him go down and dre&s;s his ma&s;|ter's wounds. He al&s;o called for a light, and went down with the boy into the cabin, and made &s;everal &s;trokes at mr. Porter's body with the cutla&s;s, exclaiming "What, d&mdash;n you, are you a&s;leep?"</P>
<P>About day light, the captain called John Douthard in the cabin, who, on his entering it, found mr. Porter with his knees on the cabin-floor, and his face re&s;ting on his bed, apparently lifele&s;s. Capt. Corran ordered him to take hold of mr. Porter's legs, and lift him on the bed. While Douthard was in the act of doing this,
<PB N="8" REF="026534_0007_0FD08FFF12465458">
he made &s;everal &s;trokes at the body over his head, which &s;o intimidated Douthard, that he dropped the body and ran upon deck, and acquainting his companions that the captain had murdered their pa&s;&s;enger.&mdash;At 4 o'clock, the captain came upon deck, and ordered Douthard to go down into the cabin, and &s;ew mr. Porter up in a blanket, and told him that mr. Porter's &s;ervant &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t him. Douthard refu&s;ing to do this, he &s;eized him and compel|led him by force to go into the cabin. By the captain's order, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the black boy, he laid mr. Porter's body on one of his own blankets, &s;ewed him up in it, and tied a white handkerchief round his head. The body was mangled in a mo&s;t &s;hocking manner; there were large ga&s;hes about the hips, above a foot long&mdash;he was al&s;o much cut about the arms: the &s;heet was very bloody, and much clotted blood was upon the floor, near the bed. After the body was &s;ewn up, captain Corran ordered Douthard and the black boy to throw it out of the cabin-window.&mdash;Douthard told him they were not able, and reque&s;ted his permi&s;&s;ion to call another per&s;on. He replied, that he would let no other per&s;on come into the cabin to help them. On finding, however, that they were not able to effect the purpo&s;e them&s;elves, he con&s;ented that Henry Gilmore &s;hould be called. By the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Gilmore, the corp&s;e was brought upon deck, and laid upon a board in the gang-way. From the companion door to the gang-way, there was a con&s;iderable quantity of blood, which had run through the blanket as they were carrying the body along.&mdash;While the corp&s;e was lying in the gang-way, the cap|tain came upon deck, leaned over the quarter-rail, co|vered his eyes with his hands, and appeared, for &s;ome minutes, much confu&s;ed. He was rou&s;ed from this reverie by John Douthard, who a&s;ked him, if they &s;hould heave the decea&s;ed overboard? He &s;eemed &s;tartled by the que&s;tion&mdash;but bid them "away with him." The body was accordingly committed to the &s;ea: immediately
<PB N="9" REF="026534_0008_0FD090022F973E28">
after this, he ordered the ve&s;&s;el to be kept away N. W. and &s;et the &s;tudding &s;ails.</P>
<P>The mate was obliged to keep out of the captain's way, and was once forced to go in the fore-top&mdash;and at other times to conceal him&s;elf in the hold, as he had threatened to take away his life, and had pur&s;ued him apparently for that purpo&s;e, &mdash; being, whenever he came upon deck, con&s;tantly armed with a cutla&s;s and a pair of pi&s;tols.</P>
<P>On the 29th of May, the captain &s;ent &s;everal me&s;&s;ages to the mate, de&s;iring him to come on deck, and declaring that he &s;hould not hurt him. The mate accordingly came up the fore &s;cuttle; and being afraid to go aft, remained before the windla&s;s. Capt. Corran ob&s;erving his &s;hyne&s;s, and that his eye appeared perpetually on him, told him <HI>he kept a d&mdash;d &s;harp look out.</HI> After this he went down in the cabin, and kept for a con&s;iderable time hammering with a maul, which led the crew to fear that he wanted to force out the lumber-port in order to founder the ve&s;&s;el, but it afterwards appeared, that he was driving a great number of &s;pikes into the after-&s;cuttle, to fa&s;ten it down.&mdash;About noon, Henry Gilmore, who had been &s;teering, was relieved from the helm, and came forward, where the mate was, who inquired of him, what cour&s;e they were &s;teering? He informed him N. W.&mdash;On which the mate replied, that that cour&s;e would fetch no port in Europe, and that he was apprehen&s;ive that the captain had ill de&s;igns, both on them and the ve&s;&s;el. The mate then con&s;ulted as many of the crew as he conveniently could, who agreed to take the fir&s;t opportunity to &s;ecure the cap|tain. About an hour afterwards, the captain came on deck, and having walked to the tiller ropes, and turned round to proceed down the deck, Jo&s;eph York, who was then at the helm, &s;eized his arms behind, and &s;truggling with him, the re&s;t of the crew came to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, bound him, and brought him into the cabin, where they &s;ecured his hands with a pair of hand-cuffs which they found in his che&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="026534_0009_0FD090034A753348">Previous to his impri&s;onment, when he ordered the ve&s;&s;el to be &s;teered N. W. he informed the crew that they were near the Engli&s;h channel: But on the 30th of May, when the mate had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his qua|drant, and was enabled to take an ob&s;ervation, he found they were very near the latitude of this place, and in about half an hour after they &s;aw land; but a thick fog coming on, they were not able to make a harbour 'till four days afterwards, when they came to anchor in Ro&s;e Bay, between La Have and Lunenburgh. On &s;earching for the books of navigation, after confining the captain, they found that he had cut cut of every book the Table of the Sun's Declination.&mdash;Immediately on their arrival there, the mate went on &s;hore, and made report to the magi&s;trates of the tran&s;action on board the brig Falmouth. The captain was carried on &s;hore; and the depo&s;itions of the people being taken, he was committed to pri&s;on, and afterwards brought to Halifax, where the court of admiralty was a&s;&s;embled, on Friday the 11th of July, at the court-hou&s;e, for the trial of this unfortunate man, for the murder of Jo&s;eph Porter, a gentleman who took pa&s;&s;age on board the brig Falmouth, at Port Royal&punc; Jamaica.&mdash;The court being opened with the cu&s;tomary &s;olemnities, the pri&s;oner was arraigned, and pleading not guilty, was remanded for trial on Monday. On that day the trial commenced, and continued by adjournment, till Tue&s;day; when the examination on the part of the crown being ended&mdash;the pri&s;oner was called upon by the court to make his defence: But declining to offer any thing in his defence&mdash;he was again recommitted, and the court adjourned to nine o'clock on Tue&s;day.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day the court again a&s;&s;embled, and the pri|&s;oner having nothing to &s;ay in his defence, the court was ordered to be cleared. After a &s;hort period, the court was again opened, and the pri&s;oner brought to the bar, when his excellency governor Wentworth, the pre&s;ident of the court, addre&s;&s;ed the pri&s;oner: and declared, that
<PB N="11" REF="026534_0010_0FD0900696558398">
the court have deliberately con&s;idered all the evidence which had been &s;ubmitted to them, were unani|mou&s;ly of opinion, that he was guilty of the Murder of Jo&s;eph Porter. His excellency then demanded of the pri|&s;oner, if he had any thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ge, why &s;entence of Death &s;hould not be pronounced upon him? After he|&s;itating a few moments, the pri&s;oner began an imperfect narration of the proceedings on board the brig Falmouth, from her &s;ailing from Jamaica, pa&s;&s;ing over the period when the Murder was committed; of which, however, he declared he was not Guilty. Having nothing further to offer, the pre&s;ident pronounced the awful Sentence of Death upon him, and he was adjudged to be hanged on Monday the 21&s;t of July, between the hours of 10 and 1 o'clock, at Point Plea&s;ant, between the ebbing and flowing of the tide.</P>
<P>On Monday, the 21&s;t of July, this unhappy man was carried from the Pri&s;on to the Beach at Point Plea&s;ant; where he &s;atisfied, by the Forfeiture of his Life, the injur|ed Laws of the Country.</P>
<P>The above Narrative contains every material fact re|lated on the trial of William Corran; and perh there never was a trial in which every witne&s;s called, &s;o per|fectly corroborated the te&s;timony of his fellow&mdash;but, in the mid&s;t of this coincidence of evidence, the mind is left at a lo&s;s for a clew, by which to unravel the mo|tive that could induce Capt. Corran to commit a Mur|der, attended by &s;o many aggravated circum&s;tances.&mdash;The witne&s;&s;es all declared, they were unable to a&s;&s;ign any rea&s;on:- that they knew of no quarrel that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him and the decea&s;ed, previous to the 24th of May, when he was ordered out of the &s;tate-room:- that previous to that period, he had treated mr. Porter very kindly- and that his uniform conduct, both in the pa&s;&s;age from Belfa&s;t to Jamaica, and on the pa&s;&s;age home, till the 2d of May, had been &s;uch as to give no ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint to any of them.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="026534_0011_0FD0900D2D3472E0">Many have conjectured that a temporary in&s;anity, at lea&s;t, mu&s;t have been the occa&s;ion of this horrid deed. To this conjecture every feeling mind mu&s;t wi&s;h to &s;ub|&s;cribe, e&s;pecially when the te&s;timony of re&s;pectable per&s;ons, who have known capt. Corran previous to this tran&s;action, unite in de&s;cribing him as a man di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by the general quietne&s;s and inoffen&s;ivene&s;s of his manners.</P>
<P>Captain Corran was born in Ireland, in the town of Port-a-Ferre in the County of Down. He was a man of a middle &s;tature; of a robu&s;t, athletic habit, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing great bodily &s;trength and activity. He was in the 32d year of his age; and has left a father, two brothers and a &s;i&s;ter, to lament his untimely end.</P>
<P>He was in this place a few year ago, being then a forema&s;t hand on board a &s;hip laden with provi&s;ions from Ireland. His activity and behaviour were &s;o plea&s;ing to his captain, that before he left this port, he appointed him mate of the &s;hip.</P>
<P>What a contra&s;t do the plea&s;ing ideas that floated in his imagination at this period of his fir&s;t advancement in life, form with the painful reflections that mu&s;t have crowded into his mind in his la&s;t painful vi&s;it to Halifax! He feelingly noticed the contra&s;t him&s;elf&mdash;"Here," he exclaimed, "I was fir&s;t made mate of a ve&s;&s;el"&mdash;and he&s;itating, he &s;eemed by his manner, as if he would have added, "Here all my worldly pro&s;pects end&mdash;here I mu&s;t make my exit."</P>
<P>At the mention of his father's name, by a gentleman who attended him in his la&s;t moments, he bur&s;t into a flood of tears, and appeared more affected by a contem|plation of the di&s;tre&s;s which his death mu&s;t occa&s;ion to his parent, than he had ever &s;hewn on his own account.</P>
