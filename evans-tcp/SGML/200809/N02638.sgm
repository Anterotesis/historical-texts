<HEAD><HI>UNTO</HI> CHARLES <HI>II. KING OF Great Britain, And the Dominions thereunto belonging: ROBERT BARCLAY,</HI> A Servant of JESUS CHRIST, called of GOD to the Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Go&s;|pel, now again Revealed, and after a long and dark Night of Apostacy, com|manded to be Preached to all Nations, <HI>Wi&s;heth Health and Salvation.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS the Condition of Kings and Princes puts them in a Station more obvious to the View and Ob&s;ervation of the World, than that of other Men, of whom (as <HI>Cicero</HI> ob&s;erves) neither any Word or Action can be ob&s;cure; &s;o
<PB REF="003129_0003_0FF003FA54463F20">
are tho&s;e Kings (during who&s;e appearance upon the Stage of this World, it plea&s;eth the Great <HI>KING</HI> of <HI>Kings</HI> &s;ingularly to make known un|to Men the wounderful Steps of his <HI>Un&s;earchable Providence)</HI> more &s;ignally ob&s;erved, and their Lives and Actions more diligently remarked and inquired into by Po&s;terity; e&s;pecially, if tho&s;e things are &s;uch, as not only relate to the outward Tran&s;actions of this World, but al&s;o are &s;ignaliz|ed by the Manife&s;tation or Revelation of the Knowledge of God in matters Spiritual and Re|ligious. The&s;e are the things that render'd the Lives of <HI>Cyrus, Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar,</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great, in former Times, and of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, and &s;ome other Modern Princes in the&s;e la&s;t Ages, &s;o Con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>But among all the&s;e Tran&s;actions, which it hath plea&s;ed God to permit, for the Glory of his Pow|er, and the Manife&s;tation of his Wi&s;dom and Pro|vidence, no Age furni&s;heth us with things &s;o <HI>&s;trange</HI> and <HI>marvellous,</HI> whether with re&s;pect to matters Civil or Religious, as the&s;e, that have fallen out within the compa&s;s of thy time; who, tho' thou be not yet arrived at the Fiftieth Year of thy Age, ha&s;t yet been a Witne&s;s of &s;tranger things, than many Ages before produced. So that, whether we re&s;pect tho&s;e various Troubles, where|in thou found'&s;t thy &s;elf ingaged, while &s;carce got out of thy Infancy; the many different Af|flictions, wherewith Men of thy Circum&s;tances are often unacquainted; the &s;trange and unpa|rallell'd Fortune that befel thy Father; thy own narrow E&s;cape, and Bani&s;hment following there|upon, with the great improbability of thy ever Returning, (at lea&s;t without very much Pains, and tedious Combatings;) or finally, the incapa|city
<PB REF="003129_0003_0FF003FA54463F20">
thou wert under to accompli&s;h &s;uch a De&s;ign; con&s;idering the Strength of tho&s;e that had po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed them&s;elves of thy Throne, and the Terror they had inflicted upon Foreign States: And yet that, after all this, thou &s;hould'&s;t be Re&s;tored without Stroke of Sword, the help or a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Foreign States, or the contrivance and work of Humane Policy; all the&s;e do &s;ufficiently declare, that it is the <HI>Lord's Doing</HI>; which, as it is marvellous in our Eyes, &s;o it will ju&s;tly be a matter of Wonder and A&s;toni&s;hment to Generations to come; and may &s;ufficiently &s;erve, if rightly ob&s;erved, to confute and confound that <HI>Athei&s;m,</HI> wherewith this Age doth &s;o much abound.</P>
<P>As the Vindication of the <HI>Liberty of Con&s;cience</HI> (which thy Father, by giving way to the impor|tant Clamours of the <HI>Clergy,</HI> the an&s;wering and fulfilling of who&s;e unrighteous Wills, has often proved hurtful and pernicious to Princes, &s;ought in &s;ome part to re&s;train) was a great occa&s;ion of the Troubles and Revolutions; &s;o the Pretence of <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> was that which carried it on, and brought it to that pitch it came to. And tho' (no doubt) &s;ome, that were ingaged in that Work, de&s;igned good things, at lea&s;t in the beginning, (albeit always wrong in the manner they took to accompli&s;h it, <HI>viz.</HI> by Carnal Weapons;) yet &s;o &s;oon as they had ta&s;ted of the &s;weet of the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of them they had turned out, they quickly began to do tho&s;e things them&s;elves, for which they had accu&s;ed others. For their Hands were found full of Oppre&s;&s;ion, and <HI>they hated the Reproof of In&s;truction, which is the Way of Life:</HI> And they evilly intreated the Me&s;&s;engers of the Lord, and cau&s;ed to beat and impri&s;on his Prophets, and per&s;ecuted his People, whom he had called and
<PB REF="003129_0004_0FF003FD5B47EAD0">
gathered out from among them; whom he had made to beat their <HI>Swords into Plow-&s;hares, and their Spears into Pruning-books,</HI> and not to learn <HI>Carnal War</HI> any more: But he rai&s;ed them up, and armed them with <HI>Spiritual Weapons,</HI> even with his own Spirit and Power, whereby they te&s;tified in the Streets and High-ways, and publick Mar|kets and Synagogues, again&s;t the <HI>Pride, Vanity, Lu&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Hypocri&s;ie</HI> of that Generation, who were Righteous in their own Eyes; tho' often cruelly Entreated therefore: And they faithfully prophe|&s;ied and foretold them of their Judgment and Downfal, which came upon them; as by &s;everal Writings and Epi&s;tles, delivered to <HI>Oliver</HI> and <HI>Richard Cromwell,</HI> the <HI>Parliament,</HI> and other then <HI>Powers,</HI> yet upon Record, doth appear.</P>
<P>And after it plea&s;ed God to Re&s;tore thee, what Oppre&s;&s;ions, what Bani&s;hments, and Evil Entreat|ings they have met with, by Men pretending thy Authority, and cloaking their Mi&s;chief with thy Name, is known to mo&s;t Men in this I&s;land; e&s;pe|cially in <HI>England,</HI> where there is &s;carce a Pri&s;on that hath not been filled with them; nor a Judge before whom they have not been haled: <HI>Though they could never yet be found Guilty</HI> of any things, that might de&s;erve that U&s;age. Therefore the Sen&s;e of their Innocency did, no doubt, greatly con|tribute to move thee, Three Years ago, to cau&s;e &s;ome Hundreds of them to be &s;et at Liberty: For indeed their Sufferings are &s;ingular, and obviou&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;hable from all the re&s;t of &s;uch as live un|der thee, in the&s;e two re&s;pects.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>In that among all the Plots, contrived by others again&s;t thee, &s;ince thy return into</HI> Britain, <HI>there was never any, owned of that People, found or known
<PB REF="003129_0004_0FF003FD5B47EAD0">
to be guilty,</HI> (though many of them have been taken and impri&s;oned upon &s;uch kind of Jealou&s;ies) <HI>but were always found Innocent and Harmle&s;s,</HI> (as became the Followers of Chri&s;t) <HI>not covering after, nor contending for the Kingdoms of this World; but &s;ubject to every Ordinance of Man, for Con&s;cience &s;ake.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>In that, in the bette&s;t times of Per&s;e|cution, and the mo&s;t violent Pro&s;ecution of tho&s;e Laws made again&s;t Meetings</HI> (being cloathed with Inno|cency) <HI>they have boldly &s;tood to their Te&s;timony for God, without creeping into Holes or Corners, or once biding them&s;elves,</HI> as all other Di&s;&s;enters have done; <HI>but daily met, according to their cu&s;tom, in the publick places appointed for that end</HI>; &s;o that none of thy Officers can &s;ay of them, <HI>That they have &s;urprized them in a Corner, overtaken them in a private Conventicle, or catched them lurking in their &s;ecret Chambers; nor needed they to &s;end out Spies to get them, whom they were &s;ure daily to find in their open A&s;&s;emblies, te&s;tifying for God and his Truth.</HI></P>
<P>By which, tho&s;e that have an Eye to &s;ee, may ob&s;erve their Chri&s;tian Patience and Courage, Con|&s;tancy and Suffering, joyned in one, more than in any other People, that differ from them, or oppo&s;e them. And yet in the mid&s;t of all tho&s;e Troubles, thou can&s;t bear witne&s;s, That as on the one part, they never &s;ought to detract from thee, or to render thee and thy Government odious to the People, by namele&s;s and &s;candalous Pamphlets and Libels; &s;o on the other hand, they have not &s;pared to Admoni&s;h, Exhort and Reprove thee; and have faithfully di&s;charged their Con&s;ciences towards thee, without Hattering Words, as ever
<PB REF="003129_0005_0FF004008309CD30">
the true Prophets in Ancient Times u&s;ed to do to tho&s;e Kings and Princes, under who&s;e Power, Vio|lence or Oppre&s;&s;ion was acted.</P>
<P>And albeit it is evident by Experience, to be mo&s;t agreeable both to Divine Truth, and Humane Policy, to allow every one to &s;erve God according to their Con&s;ciences; neverthele&s;s tho&s;e other Sects, who, for the mo&s;t part, dur&s;t not peep out in the Times of Per&s;ecution, while the&s;e Innocent People &s;tood bold and faithful, do now combine in a joynt Confederacy (notwith&s;tanding all the former Janglings and Contentions among them|&s;elves) to render us odious; &s;eeking unju&s;tly to wre&s;t our Doctrine and Words, as if they were both incon&s;i&s;tent with Chri&s;tianity and Civil So|ciety: So that to effectuate this their Work of Malice again&s;t us, they have not been a&s;hamed to take the Help, and commend the Labours of &s;ome invidious <HI>Socinians</HI> again&s;t us. So do <HI>Herod</HI> and <HI>Pontius Pilate</HI> agree to crucifie Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But our Practice, known to thee by good Ex|perience to be more con&s;i&s;tent with Chri&s;tianity and Civil Society, and the Peace and Welfare of this I&s;land, than that of tho&s;e that thus accu&s;e us, doth &s;ufficiently guard us again&s;t this Calumny; that we may indeed appeal to the Te&s;timony of thy Con&s;cience, as a Witne&s;s for us in the face of the Nations.</P>
<P>The&s;e things moved me to pre&s;ent the World with a Brief, but True Account of this People's Principles, in &s;ome &s;hort <HI>Theological Propo&s;itions</HI>; which, according to the Will of God, proving &s;uc|ce&s;sful, beyond my expectation, to the &s;atisfaction of &s;everal, and to the moving in many a de&s;ire of
<PB REF="003129_0005_0FF004008309CD30">
being farther informed concerning us, as being every where evil &s;poken of, and likewi&s;e meeting with publick Oppo&s;ition by &s;ome, as &s;uch will always do, &s;o long as the <HI>Devil rules in the Children of Di&s;obedience</HI>; I was thereby further ingaged, in the Liberty of the Lord, to pre&s;ent to the World this <HI>Apology</HI> of the Truth held by tho&s;e People: Which, becau&s;e of thy Intere&s;t in them, and theirs in thee, as having fir&s;t appeared, and mo&s;tly increa&s;ed in the&s;e Nations under thy Rule, I make bold to Pre&s;ent unto thee.</P>
<P>Thou knowe&s;t, and ha&s;t Experienced, <HI>their Faith|fulne&s;s towards their God, their Patience in Suf|fering, their Peaceablene&s;s towards the King, their Hone&s;ty, Plainne&s;s and Integrity in their faithful Warnings and Te&s;timonies to thee</HI>; and if thou wilt allow thy &s;elf &s;o much time as to read this, thou may'&s;t find <HI>how Con&s;onant their Principles are both to Scripture, Truth, and Right Rea&s;on.</HI> The Sim|plicity of their Behaviour, the Generality of their Condition, as being Poor Men and Illiterate; the Manner of their Porcedure, being without the Wi&s;dom and Policy of this World, hath made many conclude them Fools and Mad-Men; and neglect them, as not being capable of Rea&s;on. But tho' it be to them as their Crown, thus to be e&s;teemed of the Wi&s;e, and Great and Learned of this World, and though they rejoyce to be accounted Fools for Chri&s;t's &s;ake; yet of late, &s;ome, even &s;uch, who in the World's account are e&s;teemed both Wi&s;e and Learned, begin to judge otherwi&s;e of them, and find, that they hold forth things very agree|able both to Scriptue, Rea&s;on, and true Learning.</P>
<P>As it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the Truth I bear, &s;o it is far from me to u&s;e this Epi&s;tle as an Engine
<PB REF="003129_0006_0FF00402F7470810">
to <HI>flatter</HI> thee, the u&s;ual de&s;ign of &s;uch Works; and therefore I can neither Dedicate it to thee, nor crave thy Patronage, as if thereby I might have more Confidence to pre&s;ent it to the World, or be more hopeful of its &s;ucce&s;s. To God alone I owe what I have, and that more immediately in Matters Spiritual; and therefore to him alone, and to the Service of his Truth, I dedicate what|ever Work he brings forth in me: To whom only the Prai&s;e and Honour appertains, who&s;e Truth needs not the Patronage of Worldly Princes; his Arm and Power being that alone, by which it is Propagated, E&s;tabli&s;hed and Confirmed. But I found it upon my Spirit, to take occa&s;ion to Pre|&s;ent this Book unto thee; that as thou ha&s;t been often warned by &s;everal of that People, who are Inhahitants of <HI>England</HI>; &s;o thou may'&s;t not want a &s;ea&s;onable Adverti&s;ement, from a Member of thy Ancient Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI>; and that thou may'&s;t know (which I hope thou &s;halt have no rea&s;on to be troubled at) that God is rai&s;ing up and in|crea&s;ing that people in that Nation. And the Na|tions &s;hall al&s;o hereby know, that the <HI>Truth</HI> we profe&s;s, is not a Work of Darkne&s;s, nor propagated by &s;tealth; and that we are not a&s;hamed of the <HI>Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e we know it to be the <HI>Power of God to Salvation</HI>; and that we are no ways &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with Government, nor &s;uch Di&s;tur|bers of the Peace, as our Enemies, by traducing us, have &s;ought to make the World believe we are: For which, to thee I dare appeal, as a Wit|ne&s;s of our Peaceablene&s;s and Chri&s;tian Patience.</P>
<P>Generations to come &s;hall not more admire that &s;ingular &s;tep of Divine Providence, in Re&s;toring thee to thy Throne, without outward Blood&s;hed, than they &s;hall admire the Increa&s;e and Progre&s;s
<PB REF="003129_0006_0FF00402F7470810">
of this <HI>Truth,</HI> without all outward Help, and again&s;t &s;o great Oppo&s;ition; which &s;hall be none of the lea&s;t things rendring thy <HI>Memory</HI> Remarkable.</P>
<P>God hath done great things for thee, he hath &s;ufficiently &s;hewn thee, That it is <HI>by Him Princes rule,</HI> and that <HI>He can pull down and &s;et up at his plea&s;ure.</HI> He hath often faithfully warned thee by his Servants, &s;ince he Re&s;tored thee to thy <HI>Royal Dignity,</HI> that thy Heart might not wax wan|ton again&s;t him, to forget his Mercies and Provi|dences towards thee; whereby he might permit thee to be &s;oothed up, and lulled a&s;leep in thy Sins, by the Flattering of <HI>Court-Para&s;ites,</HI> who by their fawning, are the <HI>Ruine</HI> of many <HI>Princes.</HI></P>
<P>There is no King in the World, who can &s;o Ex|perimentally te&s;tifie of God's Providence and Goodne&s;s; neither is there any, who rules &s;o many free People, &s;o many true Chri&s;tians: Which thing renders thy Government more Honourable, thy Self more Con&s;iderable, than the Acce&s;&s;ion of many Nations, filled with &s;lavi&s;h and &s;uper&s;titious Souls.</P>
<P>Thou ha&s;t ta&s;ted of Pro&s;perity and Adver&s;ity; thou know'&s;t what it is to be Bani&s;hed thy Native Country, to be Over ruled, as well as to Rule, and &s;it upon the Throne; and being <HI>oppre&s;&s;ed,</HI> thou ha&s;t rea&s;on to know how <HI>hateful</HI> the <HI>Oppre&s;&s;or</HI> is, both to God and Man: If after all the&s;e Warnings and Adverti&s;ements, thou do&s;t not turn unto the Lord with all thy Heart; but forget him, who remem|bered thee in thy di&s;tre&s;s, and give up thy Self to follow Lu&s;t and Vanity; &s;urely great will be thy Condemnation.</P>

<P>FOra&s;much as that, which above all things I propo&s;e to my &s;elf, is to Declare and Defend the <HI>Truth;</HI> for the Service whereof I have given up and devoted my&s;elf, and all that is mine: Therefore there is nothing which for its &s;ake (by the help and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God) I may not attempt. And in this Confidence, I did &s;ome time ago publi&s;h certain Propo&s;itions of Divinity, comprehending briefly the chief Principles and Doctrines of <HI>Truth;</HI> which, appearing not unprofitable to &s;ome, and being, beyond my Expectation, well received both by Foreigners, tho' di&s;&s;enting from us, (albeit al&s;o oppo&s;ed by &s;ome Envious Ones) did &s;o far pre|vail, as in &s;ome part to remove that fal&s;e and mon&s;trous Opinion, which Lying Fame, and the Malice of our Adver|&s;aries, had implanted in the Minds of &s;ome, concerning us and our Doctrines. In this re&s;pect it &s;eem'd to me not fit to &s;pare my Pains and Labour.</P>
<P>Therefore, being acted by the &s;ame mea&s;ure of the Di|vine Spirit, and the like de&s;ign of Propagating the Truth, by which I publi&s;hed the Propo&s;itions, I judg'd it meet to explain them &s;omewhat more largely at this time, and defend them by certain Arguments.</P>
<P>Perhaps my Method of Writing may &s;eem not only dif|ferent, but even contrary, to that which is commonly u&s;ed by the Men called <HI>Divines,</HI> with which I am not con|cerned: For that I confe&s;s my &s;elf to be not only no Imi|tator and Admirer of the <HI>School Men,</HI> but an Oppo&s;er and De&s;pi&s;er of them, as &s;uch; by who&s;e Labour I judge the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion</HI> is &s;o far from being bettered, that it is rather de&s;troyed. Neither have I &s;ought to accom|modate this my Work to itching Ears, who de&s;ire rather to comprehend in their Heads the &s;ublime Notions of Truth, than to imbrace it in their Hearts: For what I have writ|ten comes more from my Heart than from my Head; what I have heard with the Ears of my Soul, and &s;een with my
<PB N="2" REF="003129_0008_0FF004079BA6EF08">
inward Eyes, and my Hands have handled of the <HI>Word of Life;</HI> and what hath been inwardly manife&s;ted to me of the things of God, that do I declare; not &s;o much minding the Eloquence and Excellency of Speech, as de|&s;iring to demon&s;trate the Efficacy &amp; Operation of Truth; and if I err &s;ometimes in the former, it is no great mat|ter; for I act not here the <HI>Grammarian,</HI> or the <HI>Orator,</HI> but the <HI>Chri&s;tian;</HI> and therefore in this I have followed the certain Rule of the <HI>Divine Light,</HI> and of the <HI>Holy Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P>And to make an end; What I have written, is written not to feed the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Knowledge,</HI> or rather <HI>vain Pride of this World,</HI> but to &s;tarve and oppo&s;e it, as the little Preface prefix'd to the <HI>Propo&s;itions</HI> doth &s;hew; which, with the Title of them, is as followeth.</P>

IT is very probable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Revelati|ons by Apo&s;tate Chri&s;tians rejected</NOTE> that many carnal and natural Chri&s;tians will oppo&s;e this Propo|&s;ition; who, being wholly unacquainted with the Movings and Actings of God's Spirit upon their Hearts, judge the &s;ame nothing nece&s;&s;ary; and &s;ome are apt to flout at it as ridiculous: Yea, to that height are the generality of Chri&s;tians apo&s;tati|zed and degenerated, that tho' there be not any thing more plainly A&s;&s;erted, more &s;eriou&s;ly Recom|mended, or more certainly Atte&s;ted to, in all the Writings of the holy Scriptures; yet nothing is le&s;s minded, and more rejected, by all &s;orts of Chri|&s;tians, than <HI>Immediate and Divine Revelation</HI>; in &s;o much, that once to lay claim to it, is matter of Reproach.

But now many aver them&s;elves Sons of God, who know nothing of this Leader; and he that affirms him&s;elf &s;o led, is, by the pretended Orthodox of this Age, pre&s;ently proclaimed a Heretick. The rea&s;on hereof is very manife&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> Becau&s;e many in the&s;e days, under the Name of <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> do experimentally find, that they are not acted nor led by God's Spirit; yea, many great <HI>Doctors, Divines, Teachers</HI> and <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> of Chri&s;tianity (com|monly &s;o called) have wholly &s;hut their Ears from hearing, and their Eyes from &s;eeing thiS <HI>Inward Guide,</HI> and &s;o are become &s;trangers unto it; whence

they are, by their own Experience, brought to this Strait, either to confe&s;s that they are as yet ignorant of God, and have only the &s;hadow of <HI>Knowledge,</HI> and not the true <HI>Knowledge</HI> of him, or that this <HI>Knowledge</HI> is acquired without Immediate Revelation.</P>

<P>For the infinite and mo&s;t wi&s;e God, who is the Foun|dation, Root &amp; Spring of all Operation, hath wrought all things by his Eternal Word and Son.<NOTE PLACE="marg">John 1.1, 2, 3.</NOTE> <HI>This is that</HI> WORD, <HI>that was in the beginning with God, and was God, by whom all things were made, and without whom was not any thing made that was made.</HI> This is that <HI>Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, by whom God created all things, by whom,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 3.9.</NOTE> <HI>and for whom, all things were created, that are in Heaven and in Earth, vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible, whether they be Thrones, or Dominions, or Principalities, or Powers,</HI> Col. 1.16. Who therefore is called, <HI>The fir&s;t born of every Crea|ture,</HI> Col. 1.15. As then, that infinite and incom|prehen&s;ible Fountain of Life and Motion, operateth in the Creatures, by his own Eternal Word and Power; &s;o no Creature has acce&s;s again unto him, but in and by the Son, according to his own ex|pre&s;s Words, <HI>No man knoweth the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him,</HI> Matth. 11.27. Luke 10.22. And again, he him&s;elf &s;aith, <HI>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life: No man cometh unto the Father but by me,</HI> John 14.6.</P>
<P>Hence he is fitly called <HI>The Mediator betwixt God and Man:</HI> For having been with God from all Eternity, being him&s;elf God, and al&s;o in time par|taking of the Nature of Man; through him is the Goodne&s;s and Love of God convey'd to Mankind, and by him again Man receiveth and partaketh of the&s;e Mercies.</P>
<P>Hence is ea&s;ily deduced the Probation of this fir&s;t A&s;&s;ertion, thus:</P>
<PB N="28" REF="003129_0021_0FF0042716DDC668">
<P>If no Man knoweth the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him; then there is no knowledge of the Father, but by the Son.</P>
<P>But, no Man knoweth the Father but the Son.</P>
<P>Therefore, there is no knowledge of the Father but by the Son.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t part of the antecedent are the plain words of Scripture: The con&s;equence thereof is undeniable; except one would &s;ay, that he hath the knowledge of the Father, while yet he knows him not; which were an ab&s;urd Repugnance.</P>
<P>Again, If the Son be the Way, the Truth, and the Life, and that no Man cometh unto the Father but by him; then there is no knowledge of the Fa|ther but by the Son.</P>
<P>But the fir&s;t is true: Therefore the la&s;t.</P>
<P>The antecedent are the very Scripture words. The con&s;equence is very evident: For how can any know a thing, who u&s;eth not the way, without which it is not knowable? But it is already proved, that there is no other way, but by the Son; &s;o that who&s;o u&s;es not that way, cannot know him, neither come unto him.</P>

<P>Where it is to be noted, that I always &s;peak of the &s;aving, certain and nece&s;&s;ary Knowledge of God, which that it cannot be acquired otherways than by the Spirit, doth al&s;o appear from many clear Scriptures. For Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in and by whom the Father is revealed, doth al&s;o reveal him&s;elf to his Di&s;ciples and Friends, in and by his Spirit; as his Manife&s;tation was &s;ometimes outward, when he te&s;tified and witne&s;&s;ed for the Truth in this World, and approved him&s;elf faithful throughout: So be|ing now withdrawn, as to the outward Man, he doth teach and in&s;truct Mankind inwardly, by his

Of this Revelation of Chri&s;t in him, <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaketh, <HI>Gal.</HI> 1.16. in which he placeth the Excellency of his Mini&s;try, and the Certainty of his Calling. And the Promi&s;e of Chri&s;t to his Di&s;ciples, <HI>Lo, I am with you to the end of the World,</HI> confirmeth the &s;ame thing; for this is an inward Pre&s;ence and Spiritual, as all acknowledge: But what relates hereto will again occur. I &s;hall deduce the Proof of this Propo&s;ition from two ma|nife&s;t places of Scripture: The fir&s;t is, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.11,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Proof</HI> 1.</NOTE> 12. <HI>What Man knoweth the things of a Man &s;ave the Spirit of Man which is in him? Even &s;o the things of God knoweth no Man, but the Spirit of God. Now we have received not the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Things of <HI>God</HI> are known by the Spirit of <HI>God.</HI></NOTE> <HI>that we might know the things which are freely given us of God.</HI> The Apo&s;tle in the ver&s;es before, &s;peaking of the wonderful things which are prepared for the Saints, after he hath declared, that <HI>the Natural Man cannot reach them,</HI> adds, that <HI>They are revealed by the Spirit of God,</HI> ver&s;. 9, 10. giving this rea&s;on, <HI>For the Spirit &s;earch|eth all things, even the deep things of God.</HI> And then he bringeth in the compari&s;on, in the ver&s;es above|mentioned very apt, and an&s;werable to our Purpo&s;e and Doctrine, that <HI>as the things of a Man are only known by the Spirit of Man; &s;o the things of God are only known by the Spirit of God:</HI> That is, that as no|thing below the Spirit of Man (as the Spirit of Brutes, or any other Creatures) can properly reach unto, or comprehend the things of a Man, as being of a nobler and higher Nature; &s;o neither can the Spirit of Man, or the Natural Man, as the Apo&s;tle in the 14th Ver&s;e &s;ub&s;umes, receive nor di&s;cern the things of God, or the things that are Spiritual, as being al&s;o of a higher Nature; which the Apo&s;tle him&s;elf gives for the rea&s;on, &s;aying, <HI>Neither can he know them becau&s;e they are Spiritually di&s;cerned.</HI> So
<PB N="30" REF="003129_0022_0FF004290A8705C8">
that, the Apo&s;tles words being reduced to an Ar|gument, do very well prove the matter under De|bate, thus:</P>
<P>If that which appertaineth properly to Man, can|not be di&s;cerned by any lower or ba&s;er Principle, than the Spirit of Man; then cannot the&s;e things, that properly relate unto God and Chri&s;t, be known or di&s;cerned by any lower or ba&s;er thing, than the Spirit of God and Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But the Fir&s;t is true: Therefore al&s;o the Second.</P>
<P>The whole &s;trength of the Argument is contain|ed in the Apo&s;tle's words before-mentioned; which therefore being granted, I &s;hall proceed to deduce a &s;econd Argument, thus:</P>
<P>That which is Spiritual, can only be known and di&s;cerned by the Spirit of God.</P>
<P>But the Revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the true and &s;aving Knowledge of him, is Spiritual:</P>
<P>Therefore the Revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the true and &s;aving Knowledge of him, can on|ly be known and di&s;cerned by the Spirit of God.</P>

<P>This Knowledge then of Chri&s;t, which is not by the Revelation of his own Spirit in the Heart, is no more properly the Knowledge of Chri&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Like the pratling of a <HI>Parrot.</HI></NOTE> than the Pratling of a <HI>Parrot,</HI> which has been taught a few words, may be &s;aid to be the Voice of a Man; for as that, or &s;ome other Bird, may be taught to &s;ound or utter forth a rational Sentence, as it hath learned it by the outward Ear, and not from any living Principle of Rea&s;on actuating it: So, ju&s;t &s;uch is that Knowledge of the things of God, which the natural and carnal Man hath gathered from the Words or Writings of Spiritual Men, which are not true to him, becau&s;e conceived in the natural Spirit, and &s;o brought forth by the wrong Organ, and not proceeding from the Spiritual Principle; no more than the words of a Man, acquired by Art, and brought forth by the Mouth of a Bird, not pro|ceeding from a Rational Principle, are true, with re&s;pect to the Bird which utters them.

He had not the Writings nor Prophe&s;yings of any going before, nor yet the Concurrence of any Church or People, to &s;trengthen him; and yet his Faith in the Word, by which he contradicted the whole World, &s;aved him and his Hou&s;e. Of which al&s;o <HI>Abraham</HI> is &s;et forth as a &s;ingular Example, be|ing therefore called the Father of the Faithful,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abraham<HI>'s Faith.</HI></NOTE> who is &s;aid <HI>again&s;t hope to have believed in hope</HI>; in that he not only willingly for&s;ook his Father's Country not knowing whither he went, in that he believed con|cerning the coming of <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> though contrary to natural probability; but above all, in that he re|fu&s;ed not to offer him up, not doubting but God was able to rai&s;e him from the Dead; of whom it is &s;aid, That <HI>in I&s;aac &s;hall thy Seed be called.</HI> And la&s;t of all, In that he re&s;ted in the Promi&s;e, that his Seed &s;hould Po&s;&s;e&s;s the Land, wherein him&s;elf was but a Pilgrim, and which to them was not to be

fulfilled while divers Ages after. The Object of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Faith, in all this, was no other but in|ward and immediate Revelation, or God &s;ignifying his Will unto him inwardly and immediately by his Spirit.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e, in this part of the Propo&s;ition, we made al&s;o mention of external Voices, Appearances and Dreams in the Alternative, I think al&s;o fit to &s;peak hereof, what in that re&s;pect, may be object|ed; to wit,</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."> <HI>That tho&s;e, who found their Faith now upon Immediate and Objective Revelation, ought to have al&s;o outward Voices or Vi&s;ions, Dreams or Apearances for it.</HI></P>

<P>From all then which is above declared, I &s;hall deduce, an Argument to conclude the Probation of this A&s;&s;ertion, thus:</P>
<P>That which any one firmly believes, as the ground and foundation of his Hope in God, and Life Eternal, is the formal Object of his Faith.</P>
<P>But the inward and immediate Revelation of God's Spirit, &s;peaking in and unto the Saints, was by them believed, as the ground and foundation of their Hope in God, and Life Eternal.</P>
<P>Therefore the&s;e inward an immediate Revela|tions were the formal Object of their Faith.</P>

<P>There is neverthele&s;s a very firm Argument con|firming the Truth of this A&s;&s;ertion, included in the Propo&s;ition it &s;elf, to wit, <HI>That the Object of the Saints Faith is the &s;ame in all Ages tho' held forth under divers Admini&s;trations.</HI> Which I &s;hall reduce to an Argu|ment, and prove thus:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>Where the Faith is one, the Object of the Faith is one.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But the Faith is one: Therefore,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>That the Faith is one, is the expre&s;s words of the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.5. who placeth the <HI>one Faith</HI> with the <HI>one God</HI>; importing no le&s;s than, that to affirm <HI>two Faiths,</HI> is as ab&s;urd as to affirm <HI>two Gods.</HI></P>

Faith were different in nature from ours. Nor doth hence any Difference ari&s;e, becau&s;e they believed in Chri&s;t, with re&s;pect to his Appearance outwardly as future; and we, as already appeared: For, neither did they then &s;o believe in him to come, as not to feel him pre&s;ent with them, and witne&s;s him near: &s;eeing the Apo&s;tl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;aith, <HI>They all drank of that &s;piri|tual Rock which followed them, which Rock was Chri&s;t.</HI> Nor do we &s;o believe concerning his Appearance pa&s;t, as not al&s;o to feel and know him <HI>pre&s;ent with us,</HI> and to <HI>feed upon him; except Chri&s;t</HI> (&s;aith the Apo&s;tle) <HI>be in you, ye are Reprobates:</HI> So that both our Faith is one, terminating in one and the &s;ame thing.

Their Example can be no Ways applicable to us, except we believe in God, as they did; that is, by the &s;ame Object. The Apo&s;tle clears this yet further by his own Example, <HI>Gal.</HI> 1.16. where he &s;aith, <HI>So &s;oon as Chri&s;t was revealed in him, he con|&s;ulted not with Fle&s;h and Blood, but forthwith believed and obeyed.</HI> The &s;ame Apo&s;tle, <HI>Heb.</HI> 13.7.8. where he exhorteth the <HI>Hebrews</HI> to follow the Faith of the Elders, adds this Rea&s;on, <HI>Con&s;idering the End of their Conver&s;ation, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the &s;ame to day, ye&s;terday, and for ever:</HI> Hereby notably in&s;inuating, that in the Object there is no alteration.</P>

<P>But further, If the Object of Faith were not one and the &s;ame, both to us and to them, then it would follow, that we were to know God &s;ome other way, than by the Spirit.</P>
<P>But this were ab&s;urd: Therefore, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>Such as deny this Propo&s;ition now a days, u&s;e here a Di&s;tinction; granting, that God <HI>is to be known by his</HI> Spirit; but again denying, that <HI>it is Immediate or Inward, but in and by the</HI> Scriptures, <HI>in which the Mind of the</HI> Spirit (as they &s;ay) <HI>being fully and amply expre&s;&s;ed, we are thereby to</HI> know God, <HI>and be led in all things.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Negative of this A&s;&s;ertion, That the Scriptures are not &s;ufficient, neither were ever ap|pointed to be the adequate and only Rule, nor yet can guide or direct a Chri&s;tian, in all tho&s;e things that are needful for him to know, we &s;hall leave that to the next Propo&s;ition to be examined.

<P>All which &s;ufficiently declares, that the Concur|rence of the Magi&s;trate doth not alter their Prin|ciples, but only their Method of Procedure. So that for my own part, I &s;ee no Difference betwixt the Actings of tho&s;e of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> and the&s;e others, (whereof the one pretended to be led by the Spirit, the other by Tradition, Scripture and Rea&s;on) &s;ave this; that the former were ra&s;h, heady and fooli&s;h, in their Proceedings, and therefore were &s;ooner brought to nothing, and &s;o into Contempt and Deri&s;ion: But the other being more Politick and Wi&s;e in their Generation, held it out longer, and &s;o have authorized their Wickedne&s;s more, with &s;eeming Authority of Law and Rea&s;on. But both their Actings being equally Evil, the Difference ap|pears to me to be only like that which is betwixt a &s;imple filly Thief, that is ea&s;ily catched, and hanged without any more ado; and a Company of re&s;olute bold Robbers, who being better guarded, tho' their Offence be nothing le&s;s, yet by Violence do (to evite the Danger) force their Ma&s;ters to give them better Terms.</P>
<P>From all which then it evidently follows, that they argue very ill, that de&s;pi&s;e and reject any Principle, becau&s;e Men, pretending to be led by it, do evil; in ca&s;e it be not the natural and con&s;e|quential Tendency of that Principle, to lead unto tho&s;e Things that are evil.</P>
<P>Again, It doth follow from what is above a&s;|&s;erted, that if the Spirit be to be rejected upon this Account, all tho&s;e other Principles ought on the

<P N="1">&sect;. I. THE former Part of this Propo&s;ition, tho' it needs no Apology for it &s;elf, yet it is a good Apology for us, and will help to &s;weep away that, among many other Calumnies, wherewith we are often loaded, as if we were Vilifiers and De|niers of the Scriptures; for in that which we affirm of them, it doth appear at what a high Rate we value them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Holy Scriptures the mo&s;t Excellent Writings in the World.</NOTE> accounting them (without all Deceit and Equivocation) the mo&s;t excellent Writings in the World; to which not only no other Writings are to be preferr'd, but even in divers Re&s;pects not comparable thereto. For, as we freely acknow|ledge, that their Authority doth not depend upon the Approbation of Canons of any Church, or A&s;|&s;embly; &s;o neither can we &s;ubject them to the fallen, corrupt, and defiled Rea&s;on of Man: And therein, as we do freely agree with the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> again&s;t the Error of the <HI>Romanists</HI>; &s;o on the other Hand, we cannot go the Length of &s;uch <HI>Protestants,</HI> as make their Authority to depend upon any Virtue or Power, that is in the Writings them&s;elves; but we de&s;ire to a&s;cribe all to that Spirit, from which they proceeded.</P>
<P>We confe&s;s indeed, there wants not a Maje&s;ty in the Stile, a Coherence in the Parts, a good Scope in the Whole; but &s;eeing the&s;e things are not di&s;|cerned by the Natural, but only by the Spiritual Man, it is the Spirit of God that mu&s;t give us that Belief of the Scriptures, which may &s;atisfie our Con&s;ciences. Therefore &s;ome of the chiefe&s;t

among <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> both in their particular Writings, and publick Confe&s;&s;ions, are forced to acknowledge this.</P>

<P><Q>But if (&s;aith he) we re&s;pect the Con&s;ciences, that they be not daily mole&s;ted with Doubts, and &s;tick not at every Scruple, it is requi&s;ite that this Per&s;wa&s;ion which we &s;peak of, be taken higher than Humane Rea&s;on, Judgment, or Conjectures; to wit, from the &s;ecret Te&s;ti|mony of the Holy Spirit. <HI>And again,</HI> To tho&s;e that ask, that <HI>we prove unto them by Rea&s;on, that</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>and the Prophets were in&s;pired of God to &s;peak:</HI> I An&s;wer, That the Te&s;timony of the Holy Spirit is more excellent than all Rea&s;on.</Q>
<HI>And again,</HI>
<Q>Let this remain a firm Truth, That he only whom the Holy Gho&s;t hath per&s;waded, can repo&s;e him&s;elf on the Scripture with a true Certainty. <HI>And la&s;tly,</HI> This then is a Judgment, which cannot be begotten, but by a Heavenly Revelation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>

Tho' then we do acknowledge the Scrip|tures to be a very Heavenly and Divine Writing, the U&s;e of them to be very Comfortable and Ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the Church of Chri&s;t, and that we al&s;o admire, and give Prai&s;e to the Lord, for his won|derful Providence, in pre&s;erving the&s;e Writings &s;o pure and uncorrupted, as we have them, through &s;o long a Night of Apo&s;tacy, to be a Te&s;timony of his Truth, again&s;t the Wickedne&s;s and Abomi|nations, even of tho&s;e, whom he made in&s;trumental in pre&s;erving them; &s;o that they have kept them to be a Witne&s;s again&s;t them&s;elves; yet we may not call them the principal Fountain of all Truth and Knowledge, nor yet the fir&s;t adequate Rule of Faith and Manners, becau&s;e the principal Fountain of Truth, mu&s;t be the Truth it &s;elf, <HI>i. e.</HI> That,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Scrip|tures are not the principal Ground of Truth.</NOTE> who&s;e Certainty and Authority depends not upon another. When we doubt of the Streams of any River or Flood, we recur to the Fountain it &s;elf, and having found it, there we de&s;i&s;t, we can go no further; becau&s;e there it &s;prings out of the Bowels of the Earth, which are in&s;crutable. Even &s;o the Writings and Sayings of all Men, we mu&s;t bring to the Word of God, I mean the Eternal Word, and if they agree hereunto, we &s;tand there; for this Word always proceedeth, and doth eternally pro|ceed from God, in and by which the un&s;earchable Wi&s;dom of God, and un&s;earchable Coun&s;el, and Will conceived in the Heart of God, is revealed unto us. That then the Scripture is not the princi|pal Ground of Faith and Knowledge, as it appears by what is above &s;poken; &s;o it is provided in the latter Part of the Propo&s;ition, which being reduced to an Argument, runs thus:</P>
<P>That, whereof the Certainty and Authority de|pends upon another, and which is received as Truth, becau&s;e of its proceeding from another, is not to be accounted the principal Ground and Origin of all Truth and Knowledge.</P>
<PB N="72" REF="003129_0043_0FF004562D6287C0">
<P>But the Scriptures Authority and Certainty de|pend upon the Spirit, by which they were dictated; and the Rea&s;on why they were received as Truth, is, becau&s;e they proceeded from the Spirit.</P>
<P>Therefore they are not the principal Ground of Truth.</P>
<P>To confirm this Atgument, I added the School-Maxim, <HI>Propter quod unumquodque e&s;t tale, illud ip&s;um magis e&s;t tale.</HI> Which Maxim, tho' I confe&s;s it doth not hold univer&s;ally, in all things; yet in this it both doth and will very well hold, as by applying it, as we have above intimated, will appear.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Argument will hold, as to the other Branch of the Propo&s;ition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neither are they the primary Rule of Faith and Manners.</NOTE> <HI>That it is not the primary adequate Rule of Faith and Manners</HI>; thus:</P>
<P>That which is not the Rule of my Faith in be|lieving the Scriptures them&s;elves, is not the pri|mary adequate Rule of Faith and Manners:</P>
<P>But the Scripture is not, nor can it be the Rule of that Faith, by which I believe them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">That the Spirit is the Rule.</NOTE>But as to this Part, we &s;hall produce divers Ar|guments hereafter, as to what is affirmed, That the <HI>Spirit,</HI> and <HI>not the Scriptures, is the Rule,</HI> it is large|ly handled in the former Propo&s;ition, the Sum where|of I &s;hall &s;ub&s;ume in one Argument, thus:</P>
<P>If by the Spirit we can only come to the true Knowledge of God: If by the Spirit we are to be led into all Truth, and &s;o be taught of all Things; Then the Spirit, and not the Scriptures, is the Foundation and Ground of all Truth and Knowledge, and the primary Rule of Faith and Manners.</P>
<P>But the fir&s;t is true; Therefore al&s;o the la&s;t.</P>
<P>Next, The very Nature of the Go&s;pel it &s;elf declareth, That the Scriptures cannot be the <HI>only</HI> and <HI>chief Rule</HI> of <HI>Christians,</HI> el&s;e there &s;hould be no Difference betwixt the <HI>Law</HI> and the <HI>Go&s;pel.</HI> As from the Nature of the New Covenant, by divers

<P>But in that there are many hundreds of things, with a regard to their Circum&s;tances, particular Chri&s;tians may be concerned in, for which, there can be no particular Rule had in the Scriptures:</P>
<P>Therefore the Scriptures cannot be a Rule to them.</P>
<P>I &s;hall give an In&s;tance in two or three Particu|lars, for to prove this Propo&s;ition. It is not to be doubted, but &s;ome Men are particularly called to &s;ome particular Services; their being not found in which, tho' the Act be no general po&s;itive Duty; yet in &s;o far as it may be required of them, is a great Sin to omit: For as much as God is zealous of his Glory, and every Act of Di&s;obedience to his Will manife&s;ted, is enough not only to hinder one greatly from that Comfort and inward Grace, which otherwi&s;e they might have, but al&s;o bringeth Con|demnation.</P>
<P>As for In&s;tance: Some are called to the Mini&s;try of the Word; <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith, <HI>There was a nece&s;&s;ity upon him to preach the Go&s;pel; Wo unto me, if I preach not.</HI></P>
<P>If it be nece&s;&s;ary that there he now Mini&s;ters of the Church, as well as then, then there is the &s;ame Nece&s;&s;ity upon &s;ome, more than upon others, to oc|cupy this Place; which Nece&s;&s;ity, as it may be in|cumbent

<P>The general Rules of the Scripture, viz. <HI>To be diligent in my Duty, to do all to the</HI> Glory of God, <HI>and for the good of his Church,</HI> can give me no light in this thing.

here, is not built upon a Scripture Propo&s;ition, but upon a Humane Principle; which, unle&s;s I be &s;ure of el&s;ewhere, the Scripture gives me no certainty in the matter.</P>

<Q>This certainty is not a bare Conjecture and probable Per&s;wa&s;ion, grounded upon Fallible Hope, but an Infallible A&s;&s;urance of Faith, founded upon the Divine Truth of the Promi&s;e of Salvation; the inward Evidences of the&s;e Graces, unto which the&s;e Pro|mi&s;es are made; the Te&s;timony of the Spirit of Adoption, witne&s;&s;ing to our Spirits, that we are the Children of God; which Spirit is the <HI>Earne&s;t</HI> of our <HI>Inheritance, whereby we are &s;ealed to the day of Redemption.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Moreover, The Scripture it &s;elf, wherein we are &s;o earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed to &s;eek after this A&s;&s;urance, doth not at all affirm it &s;elf a <HI>Rule</HI> &s;ufficient to give it, but wholly a&s;cribeth it to the Spirit, as <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.16. <HI>The</HI> Spirit <HI>it &s;elf heareth witne&s;s with our &s;pirit, that we are the Children of God.</HI> 1 John 4.13. <HI>Hereby know we

Indeed that Man, as he is a Rational Creature, hath Rea&s;on as a natural Faculty of his Soul, by which he can di&s;cern things that are Rational, we deny not; for this is a property natural and e&s;&s;ential to him, by which he can know and learn many Arts and Sciences, beyond what any other Animal can do, by the meer Animal Principle. Neither do we deny, but by this Rational Principle, Man may apprehend in his Brain, and in the Notion, a Knowledge of God, and Spiritual Things: Yet, that not being the right Organ, as in the Second Propo&s;ition hath more at length been &s;ignified, it cannot profit him towards Salvation; but rather hindreth; and in|deed the great cau&s;e of the Apo&s;tacy hath been, that Man hath &s;ought to fathom the things of God, in and by this Natural and Rational Principle,
<PB N="145" REF="003129_0079_0FF004A715B649E0">
and to build up a Religion in it, neglecting and over-looking this Principle and Seed of God in the Heart; &s;o that herein, in the mo&s;t Univer&s;al and Catholick Sen&s;e, hath <HI>Antichri&s;t in every man &s;et up him&s;elf, and &s;itteth in the</HI> Temple of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Antichri&s;t in the Tem|ple of God.</NOTE> <HI>as</HI> God, <HI>and above every thing that is called</HI> God.

Neverthele&s;s, we do not hereby affirm, as if Man had received his Rea&s;on to no purpo&s;e, or to be of no &s;ervice unto him, in no wi&s;e: We look upon Rea&s;on as fit to order and rule Man in things Natural.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Divine Light, and Natural Rea&s;on di|&s;tingui&s;hed.</NOTE> For as God gave two great Lights to rule the out|ward World, the Sun and Moon; the greater Light to rule the Day, and the le&s;&s;er Light to rule the Night: So hath he given Man the Light of his Son, a Spiritual Divine Light, to rule him in things Spiritual; and the Light of Rea&s;on to rule him in things Natural. And even as the Moon borrows her Light from the Sun, &s;o ought Men (if they would be rightly and comfortably ordered in Natural Things) to have their Rea&s;on inlightned by this Divine and Pure Light. Which inlightned Rea&s;on in tho&s;e that obey and follow this true Light, we confe&s;s may be u&s;eful to Man, even in Spiritual Things, as it is &s;till &s;ub&s;ervient, and &s;ubject to the other; even as the Animal Life in Man, regulated and ordered by his Rea&s;on, helps him in going about things that are Rational.

And &s;o is a faithful Wit|ne&s;s for God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;cience <HI>defined.</HI></NOTE> again&s;t every Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s <HI>in Man.</HI> Now <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> to define it truly, comes from <HI>(Con&s;cire)</HI> and <HI>is that Knowledge, which ari&s;eth in Man's Heart, from what agreeth, contradicteth, or is con|trary to any thing believed by him; whereby he becomes Con&s;cious to him&s;elf, that he tran&s;gre&s;&s;eth, by doing that which he is per&s;waded, he ought not to do.</HI> So that the Mind being once blinded, or defiled with a wrong Belief, there rai&s;eth a Con&s;cience from that Belief, which troubles him, when he goes again&s;t it. As for Example:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Example of a <HI>Turk.</HI></NOTE> A <HI>Turk</HI> who hath po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with a fal&s;e Belief, that it is unlawful for him to drink Wine; if he do it, his Con&s;cience &s;mites him for it: But tho' he keep many Concubines, his Con&s;cience troubles him not; becau&s;e his Judg|ment is already defiled with a fal&s;e Opinion, that it is lawful for him to do the one, and unlawful to do the other. Whereas if the Light of Chri&s;t in him were minded, it would reprove him, not only for committing Fornication; but al&s;o, as he be|came obedient thereunto, inform him that <HI>Mahomet</HI> was an <HI>Impostor</HI>; as well as <HI>Socrates</HI> was informed by it, in his day, of the Fal&s;ity of the Heathen's Gods.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Example of a <HI>Papi&s;t</HI></NOTE>So, if a <HI>Papi&s;t</HI> eat Fle&s;h in <HI>Lent,</HI> or be not dili|gent enough in Adoration of Saints and Images, or if he &s;hould Condemn Images, his Con&s;cience would &s;mite him for it; becau&s;e his Judgment is already blinded with a fal&s;e Belief concerning the&s;e things: Whereas the Light of Chri&s;t never con&s;ented to any of tho&s;e Abominations. Thus then Man's Na|tural Con&s;cience is &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hed from it; for Con&s;cience followeth the Judgment, doth not inform it; but this Light, as it is received,
<PB N="147" REF="003129_0080_0FF004A8F9C759F0">
removes the Blindne&s;s of the Judgment, opens the Under&s;tanding, and rectifies both the Judgment and Con&s;cience. So we confe&s;s al&s;o, that Con|&s;cience is an excellent thing, where it is rightly informed and inlightned: Wherefore &s;ome of us have fitly compared it to the Lanthorn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Na|tural Con|&s;cience Compared to a <HI>Lan|thorn,</HI> and the Light of Chri&s;t the <HI>Candle.</HI></NOTE> and the Light of Chri&s;t to a Candle: A Lanthorn is u&s;e|ful, when a clear Candle burns and &s;hines in it; but otherwi&s;e of no u&s;e. To the Light of Chri&s;t then, in the Con&s;cience, and not to Man's Natu|ral Con&s;cience, it is, that we continually commend Men; this, not that, is it which we preach up, and direct People to, as to a mo&s;t certain Guide unto Life Eternal.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> This <HI>Light, Seed,</HI> &amp;c. appears to be no Power or Natural Faculty of Man's Mind; becau&s;e a Man that's in his Health, can, when he plea&s;es, &s;tir up, move and exerci&s;e the Faculties of his Soul; he is ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter of them; and except there be &s;ome natural Cau&s;e or Impediment in the way, he can u&s;e them at his plea&s;ure: But this <HI>Light and Seed of God in Man,</HI> he cannot move and &s;tir up when he plea&s;eth; but it moves, blows, and &s;trives with Man, as the Lord &s;eeth meet. For, tho' there be a Po&s;&s;ibility of Salvation to every Man, during the Day of his Vi&s;itation; yet cannot a Man, at any time, when he plea&s;eth, or hath &s;ome &s;en&s;e of his <HI>Mi&s;ery,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Wait|ing upon the Mo|vings of the Light and Grace.</NOTE> &s;tir up that Light and Grace, &s;o as to procure to him&s;elf ten|derne&s;s of Heart; but he mu&s;t wait for it: Which comes upon all, at certain times and &s;ea&s;ons, wherein it works powerfully upon the Soul, mightily tenders it, and breaks it; at which time, if Man re&s;i&s;t it not, but clo&s;es with it, he comes to know Salvation by it. Even as the Lake of <HI>Bethe&s;da</HI> did not Cure all tho&s;e, that wa&s;hed in it; but &s;uch only, as wa&s;hed fir&s;t, after the Angel had moved upon the Waters; &s;o God moves in Love to Mankind, in this Seed in his Heart, at &s;ome

&s;ingular times, &s;etting his Sins in order before him, and &s;eriou&s;ly inviting him to Repentance, offering to him Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins and Salvation; which, if Man accept of, he may be &s;aved. Now there is no Man alive, and I am confident there &s;hall be none to whom this Paper &s;hall come, who, if they will deal faithfully and hone&s;tly with their own Hearts but mu&s;t be forced to acknowledge, they have been &s;en&s;ible of this in &s;ome mea&s;ure le&s;s or more; which is a thing, that Man cannot bring up|on him&s;elf, with all his Pains and Indu&s;try.

<P N="17"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Qu. 7.</NOTE>&sect;. XVII.

Is not then the Will of Man the Cau&s;e of the one's</HI> Salvation <HI>beyond the other</HI>? I &s;ay, to &s;uch we thus An&s;wer: That as the Grace and Light in all, is &s;ufficient to &s;ave all, and of its own. nature would &s;ave all; &s;o it &s;trives and wre&s;tles with all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Light's Operation in order to Salvation.</NOTE> for to &s;ave them; he that re&s;i&s;ts its &s;triving, is the cau&s;e of his own Condemnation; he that re&s;i&s;ts it not, it becomes
<PB N="149" REF="003129_0081_0FF004AC6BD40050">
his Salvation: So that in him that is &s;aved, the working is of the Grace, and not of the Man; and it's a Pa&s;&s;ivene&s;s, rather than an act; tho' after|wards, as Man is wrought upon, there is a Will rai&s;ed in him, by which he comes to be a co-worker with the Grace: For according to that of <HI>Augustin, He that made us without us, will not &s;ave us without us.</HI> So that the fir&s;t &s;tep is not by Man's working, but by his not contrary-working. And we believe that at the&s;e &s;ingular Sea&s;ons of every Man's Vi&s;itation, above-mentioned; as Man is wholly unable of him&s;elf to work with the Grace, neither can he move one &s;tep out of the Natural Condition, until the Grace lay hold upon him; &s;o it is po&s;&s;ible to him to be pa&s;&s;ive, and not to re&s;i&s;t it, as it is po&s;&s;ible for him to re&s;i&s;t it. So we &s;ay, the Grace of God works in and upon Man's Nature; which, tho' of it &s;elf wholly cor|rupted and defiled, and prone to Evil; yet is ca|pable to be wrought upon by the Grace of God; even as Iron, tho' a hard and cold Metal of it &s;elf, may be warm'd and &s;oftned by the heat of the Fire, and Wax melted by the Sun. And as Iron or Wax, when removed from the Fire or Sun, returneth to its former condition of coldne&s;s and hardne&s;s: So Man's Heart, as it re&s;i&s;ts, or retires from the Grace of God, returns to its former condition again. I have often had the manner of God's Working, in order to Salvation towards all Men, illu&s;trated to my Mind, by one or two clear Examples, which I &s;hall here add, for the Informa|tion of others.</P>

<P>Many famous Prote&s;tants bear witne&s;s to this In|ward Ju&s;tification by Chri&s;t, inwardly revealed and formed in Man. As, 1. <HI>M. Borhaeus</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Borhaeus <HI>in</HI> Gen. <HI>p.</HI> 162.</NOTE>
<Q>In the Im|putation (&s;aith he) wherein Chri&s;t is a&s;cribed and imputed to Believers for Righteou&s;ne&s;s, the Merit of his Blood, and the Holy Gho&s;t given unto us by Vertue of his Merits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Te&s;ti|monies of Famous Prote&s;tants of Inward Ju&s;tifica|tion.</NOTE> are equally in|cluded.

<Q>The Form (&s;aith he) of our Ju&s;tification is the Divine Righteou&s;ne&s;s it &s;elf, by which we are formed Ju&s;t and Good.

The fir&s;t are tho&s;e, which are performed in Man's own Will, and by his Strength, in a con|formity to the outward Law and Letter; and there|fore are Man's own imperfect Work, or Works of the Law, which <HI>makes nothing perfect</HI>: And to this belong all the Ceremonies, Purifications, Wa&s;hings, and Traditions of the Jews. The &s;econd are the Works of the Spirit of Grace in the Heart, wrought in conformity to the Inward and Spiritual Law; which Works are not wrought in Man's Will, nor by his Power and Ability, but in and by the Power and Spirit of Chri&s;t <HI>in us,</HI> and therefore are pure and perfect in their kind (as &s;hall hereafter be pro|ved) and may be called Chri&s;t's Works, for that he is the immediate Author and Worker of them: Such Works we affirm ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to Ju&s;tifi|cation, &s;o that a Man cannot be Ju&s;tified without them; and all Faith without them is dead and u&s;e|le&s;s, as the Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> &s;aith. Now, that &s;uch a di&s;tinction is to be admitted, and that the Works ex|cluded by the Apo&s;tle, in the matter of Ju&s;tification, are of the fir&s;t kind, will appear, if we con&s;ider the occa&s;ion of the Apo&s;tle's mentioning this, as well here, as throughout in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Galatians,</HI>

And that the Works excluded by the Apo&s;tle are of this kind of Works of the Law, appears by the &s;train of his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Galatians,</HI> Chap. 1, 2, 3, &amp; 4. For after (in <HI>Chap.</HI> 4.) he upbraideth them for their returning unto the Ob&s;ervation of <HI>Days</HI> and <HI>Times,</HI> and that (in the beginning of <HI>Chap.</HI> 5.) he &s;heweth them their Folly, and the Evil Con&s;e|quence of adhering to the Ceremonies of Circum|ci&s;ion; then he adds, v. 6. <HI>For in Chri&s;t Je&s;us neither Circumci&s;ion nor Uncircumci&s;ion availeth; but Faith, which worketh by love</HI>; and thus he concludes again, chap. 6. v. 15. <HI>For in Christ Je&s;us neither Circumci&s;ion availeth, nor Uncircumci&s;ion, but a new Creatre.</HI> From which places appeareth that di&s;tinction of Works before mentioned, whereof the one is excluded, the other nece&s;&s;ary to Ju&s;tification. For the Apo&s;tle &s;heweth here, that Circumci&s;ion (which word is often u&s;ed to comprehend the whole Ceremonies and Legal Performances of the Jews,) is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary, nor doth avail.

To wit, not the outward Te&s;timony and Tra|dition of the Law, but the fruits of the Spirit, men|tioned a little before; by which Spirit he would have them to be led, and walk in tho&s;e good Works: As al&s;o, how much he a&s;cribed to the&s;e good Works, by which he affirms Life Everla&s;ting is reaped.

Now I come to &s;peak of <HI>Wor&s;hip,</HI> or of tho&s;e Acts, whether private or publick, general or particular, whereby Man renders to God that part of his Duty, which relates immediately to him: And as <HI>Obedience is better than Sacrifice,</HI> &s;o neither is any Sacrifice <HI>acceptable,</HI> but that which is done accord|ing to the Will of him, to whom it is <HI>offered.</HI> But Men, finding it ea&s;ier to <HI>&s;acrifice</HI> in their own Wills, than obey God's Will, have heaped up Sacrifices without Obedience; and thinking to deceive God, as they do one another, give him a &s;hew of Reverence, Honour and Wor&s;hip, while they are both inwardly e&s;tranged and alienated from his Holy and Righte|ous Life, and wholly &s;trangers to the pure Breathings of his Spirit, in which the acceptable Sacrifice and Wor&s;hip is only offered up.<NOTE PLACE="marg">True Wor|&s;hip and Duty to God-warde corrupted.</NOTE> Hence it is that there is not any thing relating to Man's Duty towards God, which among all &s;orts of People hath been more vitiated, and in which the Devil hath more prevailed, than in abu&s;ing Man's Mind concerning this thing: And as among many other, &s;o among tho&s;e called Chri&s;tians, nothing hath been more out of order, and more corrupted, as &s;ome Papi&s;ts, and all Prote&s;tants, do acknowledge.

For tho' they that partake of the Fle&s;h and Blood of Chri&s;t, cannot but remember him; yet the Lord, and his Death, may be remembred (as none can deny) where his Fle&s;h and Blood is not truly partaken of.

<HEAD><HI>PROPOSITION XIV.</HI> Concerning the Power of the <HI>Civil Magi&s;trate</HI> in Matters purely <HI>Religious,</HI> and pertaining to the <HI>Con&s;cience.</HI></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Since God hath a&s;&s;umed to him&s;elf the Power and Do|minion of the <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> who alone can rightly in|&s;truct and govern it; therefore it is not lawful for any who&s;oever, by vertue of any Authority or Principality they bear in the Goverment of this World, to force the <HI>Con&s;ciences</HI> of others;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 9.55, 56. Mat. 7.12, 29. Tit. 3.10.</NOTE> and therefore all Killing, Bani&s;hing, Fining, Impri&s;oning, and other &s;uch things, which are inflicted upon Men for the alone Exerci&s;e of their <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> or Difference in <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> or <HI>Opinion,</HI> proceedeth from the Spirit of <HI>Cain,</HI> the Murtherer, and is contrary to the Truth: Providing always, That no Man, under the Pretence of <HI>Con|&s;cience,</HI> prejudice his <HI>Neighbour</HI> in his Life or E&s;tate, or do any thing de&s;tructive to, or incon&s;i&s;tent with <HI>Humane Society;</HI> in which ca&s;e the <HI>Law</HI> is for the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, and <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> is to be admini&s;tred upon all, without re&s;pect of Per&s;ons.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">&sect;. I. <HI>LIberty of Con&s;cience</HI> from the Power of the Civil Magi&s;trate, hath been of late Years &s;o largely and learnedly handled, that I &s;hall not need to be but brief in it; yet it is to be lamented, that few have walked an&s;werably to this Principle, each pleading it for them&s;elves, but &s;carce allowing it to others; as hereafter I &s;hall have occa&s;ion more at length to ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>It will be fit in the fir&s;t place, for clearing of Mi&s;takes, to &s;ay &s;omething of the State of the <HI>Con|trover&s;ie,</HI> that what follows may be the more clearly underdood.</P>
<P>By [<HI>Con&s;cience</HI>] then, as in the Explanation of the <HI>Fifth</HI> and <HI>Sixth Propo&s;itions</HI> I have ob&s;erved, is to be
<PB N="487" REF="003129_0250_0FF0063DC730AAF0">
under&s;tood, <HI>That Per&s;wa&s;ion of the Mind, which ari&s;es from the Understanding's being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the Belief of the Truth or Fal&s;ity of any thing:</HI> Which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Con|&s;cience is?</NOTE> tho' it may be fal&s;e or Evil upon the matter, yet if a Man &s;hould go again&s;t his Per&s;wa&s;ion, or Con&s;cience, he &s;hould commit a Sin; becau&s;e what a Man doth contrary to his Faith, tho' his Faith be wrong, is no ways acceptable to God. Hence the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>What&s;oever is not of Faith, is &s;in;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 14.23</NOTE> <HI>and he that doubteth, is damned, if he eat:</HI> Tho' the thing might have been lawful to another; and that this doubting to eat &s;ome kind of <HI>Meats</HI> (&s;ince all the Creatures of God are good, and for the u&s;e of Man, <HI>if re|ceived with Thank&s;giving</HI>) might be a Super&s;tition, or at lea&s;t a Weakne&s;s, which were better removed.

<P>So the Que&s;tion is, Fir&s;t, <HI>Whether the Civil Ma|gi&s;trate hath Power to force Men in things Religious, to do contrary to their Con&s;cience; and if they will not, to puni&s;h them in their Goods, Liberties or Lives</HI>? This we hold in the Negative. But <HI>Secondly,</HI> As we would have the <HI>Magi&s;trate</HI> avoiding this extream of incroaching upon Men's Con&s;ciences; &s;o on the other hand, we are far from joyning with, or &s;trengthening &s;uch <HI>Libertines,</HI> as would &s;tretch the Liberty of their Con&s;ciences, to the Prejudice of their <HI>Neighbours,</HI> or to the Ruine of <HI>Humane Society.</HI> We under&s;tand therefore by <HI>Matters of Con&s;cience,</HI> &s;uch as immediately relate betwixt <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man,</HI> or <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Men,</HI> that are under the &s;ame <HI>Per|&s;wa&s;ion:</HI> As to meet together and wor&s;hip God in that way, which they judge is mo&s;t acceptable unto him; and not to incroach upon, or &s;eek to force their Neighbours, otherwi&s;e than by Rea&s;on, or &s;uch other Means, as Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles

<P N="2">&sect;. II. But that no Man, by vertue of any Power or Principality he hath in the Government of this World, hath Power over the <HI>Con&s;ciences of Men,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;cience the Throne of God.</NOTE> is apparent, becau&s;e <HI>the Con&s;cience of Man, is the Seat and Throne of God in him,</HI> of which God is the alone proper and infallible <HI>Judge,</HI> who by his Power and Spirit, can alone rectifie the Mi&s;takes of <HI>Con&s;cience</HI>; and therefore hath re&s;erved to him&s;elf the Power of puni&s;hing the Errors thereof, as he &s;eeth meet. Now for the <HI>Magi&s;trate</HI> to a&s;&s;ume this, is to take upon him to meddle with things not within the compa&s;s of his Juri&s;diction; for if this were within the compa&s;s of his Juri&s;diction, he &s;hould be the proper Judge in the&s;e things; and al&s;o it were needful to him, as an E&s;&s;ential Qualification of his being a <HI>Magi&s;trate,</HI> to be capable to judge in them. But that the <HI>Ma|gi&s;trate,</HI> as a <HI>Magistrate,</HI> is neither proper Judge in the&s;e Ca&s;es, nor yet that the Capacity &s;o to be, is requi&s;ite in him, as a <HI>Magi&s;trate,</HI> our <HI>Adver&s;aries</HI> can|not deny; or el&s;e they mu&s;t &s;ay, That all the <HI>Hea|then Magi&s;trates,</HI> were either no <HI>lawful Magi&s;trates,</HI> as wanting &s;omething E&s;&s;ential to Magi&s;tracy, and this were contrary to the expre&s;s Doctrine of the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. or el&s;e (which is more ab&s;urd) that tho&s;e <HI>Heathen Magistrates</HI> were proper Judges in Matters of <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> among&s;t <HI>Christians.</HI> As for that Eva&s;ion, That the <HI>Magi&s;trate</HI> ought to puni&s;h according to the Church Cen&s;ure and Determina|tion, which is indeed no le&s;s, than to make the
<PB N="490" REF="003129_0252_0FF0063F668363E8">
<HI>Magistrate</HI> the <HI>Church's Hang-Man</HI>; we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak of it hereafter. But if the chief Members of the <HI>Church,</HI> tho' ordained to inform, in&s;truct and reprove, are not to have dominion over the <HI>Faith</HI> nor <HI>Con&s;ciences</HI> of the Faithful, is the Apo&s;tle expre&s;ly affirms, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.24. then far le&s;s ought they to u&s;urp this Dominion, or &s;tir up the Magi&s;trate to per&s;ecute and murther tho&s;e, who will not yield to them therein.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI>; This pretended Power of the <HI>Magi|&s;trate,</HI> is both contrary unto, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the Nature of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> which is a thing altoge|ther extrin&s;ick to the Rule and Government of <HI>Political States,</HI> as Chri&s;t expre&s;ly &s;ignified, &s;aying, His <HI>Kingdom</HI> was <HI>not of this World</HI>: And if the Pro|pagating of the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> had had any nece&s;&s;ary Rela|tion thereunto, then Chri&s;t had not &s;aid &s;o. But he abundantly hath &s;hewn, by his Example, whom we are chiefly to imitate in matters of that Na|ture, that it's by <HI>Per&s;wa&s;ion,</HI> and the <HI>Power of God</HI>; not by <HI>Whips, Impri&s;onments, Bani&s;hments</HI> and <HI>Mur|therings,</HI> that the Go&s;pel is to be propagated; and that tho&s;e, that are the Propagators of it, are often to &s;uffer by the Wicked, but never to cau&s;e the Wicked to &s;uffer. When he &s;ends forth his Di&s;ci|ples, he tells them, he &s;ends them forth as <HI>Lambs among Wolves,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 10.16.</NOTE> to be willing to be <HI>devoured,</HI> not to <HI>devour</HI>; he tells them of their being <HI>whipped, im|pri&s;oned</HI> and <HI>killed</HI> for their Con&s;cience; but never that they &s;hall ever <HI>whip, impri&s;on</HI> or <HI>kill</HI>: And in|deed, if <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> mu&s;t be as <HI>Lambs,</HI> it is not the Nature of <HI>Lambs</HI> to de&s;troy or devour any. It &s;erves nothing to alledge, That in Chri&s;t's and his Apo&s;tles times, the <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> were <HI>Heathens</HI>; and therefore Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles (nor yet any of the Believers) being no <HI>Magi&s;trates,</HI> could not exerci&s;e the Power: Becau&s;e it cannot be denied, but Chri&s;t, being the <HI>Son of God,</HI> had a true Right to all <HI>Kingdoms,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 28.18.</NOTE> and was <HI>righteous Heir</HI> of the Earth.
<PB N="491" REF="003129_0252_0FF0063F668363E8">
<HI>Next,</HI> as to his <HI>Power,</HI> it cannot be denied, but he could, if he had &s;een meet, have called for <HI>Legions of Angels</HI> to defend him, and have forced the <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>Potentates</HI> of the Earth to be &s;ubject unto him, <HI>Mat.</HI> 26.53. So that it was only, becau&s;e it was contrary to the Nature of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Go&s;pel and Mini|&s;try, to u&s;e any Force or Violence in the gathering of Souls to him. This he abundantly expre&s;&s;ed in his Reproof to the two Sons of <HI>Zebedee,</HI> who would have been calling for <HI>Fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from Heaven,</HI> to burn tho&s;e that refu&s;ed to receive Chri&s;t: It is not to be doubted, but this was as great a Crime, as now to be in an Error concerning the Faith and Doctrine of Chri&s;t. That there was not Power wanting, to have puni&s;hing tho&s;e Refu&s;ers of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> cannot be doubted; for they that could do other Miracles, might have done this al&s;o. And moreover, they wanted not the precedent of a holy Man under the Law, as did <HI>Elias</HI>; yet we &s;ee what Chri&s;t &s;aith to them, <HI>Ye know not what Spirit ye are of,</HI> Luke 9.55. <HI>For the Son of Man is not come to de&s;troy Men's Lives, but to &s;ave them.</HI> Here Chri&s;t &s;hews, that &s;uch kind of <HI>Zeal</HI> was no ways approved of him; and &s;uch as think to make way for <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> or his <HI>Go&s;pel,,</HI> by this means, do not under&s;tand what <HI>Spirit they are of.</HI> But if it was not lawful to call for <HI>Fire from Heaven,</HI> to de&s;troy &s;uch as refu&s;ed to receive Chri&s;t; it is far le&s;s lawful to kindle <HI>Fire upon Earth</HI> to de&s;troy tho&s;e that believe in Chri&s;t; becau&s;e they will not believe, nor can believe as the Magi&s;trates do, for Con&s;cience &s;ake. And if it was not lawful for the Apo&s;tles, who had &s;o large a mea&s;ure of the Spirit, and were &s;o little liable to Mi&s;take, to force others to their Judgment; it can be far le&s;s lawful now for Men, that, as Experience declareth, and many of them&s;elves confe&s;s, are Fallible, and often Mi&s;taken, to kill and de&s;troy all &s;uch, as cannot (becau&s;e otherwi&s;e per&s;waded in their Minds) judge and believe in matters of Con|&s;cience,

<P><HI>Secondly</HI>; Seeing every Magi&s;trate is to exerci&s;e his Power, according to the be&s;t Under&s;tanding he hath, being obliged &s;o to do, for the promo|ting of what he in Con&s;cience is per&s;waded to be Truth: Will not this ju&s;tifie all the Heathen Em|perors in their Per&s;ecutions again&s;t Chri&s;tians? Will not this ju&s;tifie the <HI>Spani&s;h Inqui&s;ition,</HI> which yet is Odious not only to Prote&s;tants, but to many mode|rate Papi&s;ts? How can Prote&s;tants in rea&s;on condemn the Papi&s;ts for per&s;ecuting them, &s;eeing they do but exerci&s;e a Lawful Power, according to their Con|&s;cience and be&s;t Under&s;tanding; and do no more to them, than the Sufferers profe&s;s they would do to them, if they were in the like capacity? Which takes away all ground of Commi&s;eration from the Sufferers; whereas that was the ground that gain|ed of old, Reputation to the Chri&s;tians, that they, being Innocent, &s;uffered, who neither had, nor by Principle could, hurt any. But there is little rea|&s;on to pity one, that is but dealt by, according as he would deal with others. For to &s;ay, <HI>They have not rea&s;on to per&s;ecute us, becau&s;e they are in the wrong, and we in the right,</HI> is but mi&s;erably to beg the Que&s;tion. Doth not this Doctrine &s;trengthen the Hands of Per&s;ecutors every where, and that Ra|tionally, from a Principle of Self-pre&s;ervation? For who can blame me for de&s;troying him, that I know waits but for an occa&s;ion to de&s;troy me, if he could? Yea, this makes all Suffering for Re|ligion, which of old was the Glory of Chri&s;tians, to be but of pure nece&s;&s;ity; whereby they are not led as <HI>Lambs to the &s;laughter,</HI> as was the <HI>Captain of

Where is the Faith and Patience of the Saints? For indeed, it is but a &s;mall Glory to make a Vertue of Nece&s;&s;ity, and Suffer, becau&s;e I cannot help it. Every Thief and Murtherer would be a Martyr, at that rate; Experience hath abundantly proved this in the&s;e la&s;t Centuries. For, however each Party talk of <HI>pa&s;&s;ively</HI> obeying the Magi&s;trate in &s;uch ca&s;es, and that the Power re&s;ides in him; yet it is appa|rent, that from this Principle it naturally follows, than any Party, &s;uppo&s;ing them&s;elves right, &s;hould &s;o &s;oon as they are able, endeavour at any rate to get uppermo&s;t, that they might bring under tho&s;e of another Opinion, and force the Magi&s;trate to uphold their Way, to the ruine of all others. What Engine the Pope of <HI>Rome</HI> u&s;ed to make of his pre|tended Power in this thing, upon any pretence of di&s;like to any Prince or State, even for very &s;mall Here&s;ies, in their own account, to depo&s;e Princes, and &s;et up their Subjects again&s;t them, and give their Dominions to other Princes to &s;erve his In|tere&s;t, they cannot be ignorant, that have read the Life of <HI>Hildebrand</HI>; and how Prote&s;tants have vindicated the Liberty of their Con&s;ciences, after this &s;ame manner, is apparent. They &s;uffered much in <HI>France,</HI> to the great Increa&s;e and Advantage of their Party; but how &s;oon they found them&s;elves con&s;iderable, and had gotten &s;ome Princes upon their &s;ide, they began to let the King know, that they mu&s;t either have the Liberty of their Con|&s;ciences, or el&s;e they would purcha&s;e it; not by Suffering, but by Fighting. And the Experience of other Prote&s;tant States &s;hews, that if <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, to plea&s;e the Papi&s;ts, had not quitted his Religion, to get the Crown the more peaceably, and &s;o the Prote&s;tants had prevailed with the Sword,
<PB N="501" REF="003129_0257_0FF0064C341F3B30">
they would as well have taught the Papi&s;ts with the Faggot, and led them to the Stake: So that this Principle of Per&s;ecution, on all hands, is the ground of all tho&s;e Mi&s;eries and Contentions. For &s;o long as any Party is per&s;waded, that it is both lawful for them, and their duty, if in power, to de&s;troy tho&s;e that differ from them; it naturally follows, they ought to u&s;e all means po&s;&s;ible to get that Power, whereby they may &s;ecure them&s;elves in the ruine of their Adver&s;aries. And that <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> judge it not unlawful to compel the Magi&s;trate, if they be &s;trong enough to do it, to effect this; Experience &s;hews it to be a known Popi&s;h principle, That <HI>the Pope may depo&s;e an Heretick Prince, and ab|&s;olve the People from the Oath of Fidelity:</HI> And the Pope, as is above &s;aid, hath done &s;o to divers Princes; and this Doctrine is defended by <HI>Bel|larmine</HI> again&s;t <HI>Barclay.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> refu&s;ed <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, till he quitted his Religion. And as for Prote&s;tants, many of them &s;cruple not to affirm, <HI>That</HI> wicked Kings <HI>and</HI> Magi&s;trates <HI>may be depo&s;ed and killed</HI>; yea, our <HI>Scotch Pre&s;byterians</HI> are as po&s;itive in it, as any <HI>Je&s;uits</HI>; who would not admit King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, tho' otherwi&s;e a Prote&s;tant Prince, unle&s;s he would &s;weat to Renounce <HI>Epi&s;copacy,</HI> a matter of a great difference, tho' contrary to his Con&s;cience. Now how little proportion the&s;e things bear with the Primitive Chri&s;tians, and the Religion propagated by Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, needs no great demon&s;tration; and it is ob&s;ervable, That notwith&s;tanding many other Super&s;titions crept into the Church very early, yet this of Per|&s;ecution was &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with the Nature of the Go&s;pel, and Liberty of Con&s;cience, as we have a&s;|&s;erted it, &s;uch an innate and natural part of the Chri&s;tian Religion, that almo&s;t all the Chri&s;tian Writers, for the fir&s;t Three Hundred Years, ear|ne&s;tly contended for it, condemning the contrary Opinion.</P>

<P N="6">&sect;. VI. Now the ground of Per&s;ecution, as hath been above &s;hewn, is an <HI>unwillingne&s;s to &s;uffer</HI>; for no Man, that will per&s;ecute another for his <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> would &s;uffer for his own, if he could avoid it, &s;eeing his Principle obliges him, if he had power, by force to e&s;tabli&s;h that which he judges is the Truth, and &s;o to force others to it. Therefore I judge it meer, for the Information of the Nations, briefly to add &s;omething in this place concerning the <HI>Nature of true Chri&s;tian Sufferings</HI>; whereunto a very faithful Te&s;timony has been born by God's Witne&s;&s;es, which he hath rai&s;ed up in this Age, beyond what hath been generally known or practi&s;ed for the&s;e many Generations, yea, &s;ince the Apo&s;ta&s;ie took place. Yet 'tis not my de&s;ign here in any wi&s;e to derogate from the Sufferings of the Prote&s;tant Martyrs, whom I believe to have walked in Faithfulne&s;s towards God, according to the Di&s;pen&s;ation of <HI>Light</HI> in that Day appearing, and of which many were utter Ene|mies to Per&s;ecution, as by their Te&s;timonies again&s;t it might be made appear.</P>
<P>But the True, Faithful and Chri&s;tian Suffering is, <HI>for, Men to profe&s;s what they are per&s;waded is right, and &s;o practi&s;e and perform their Wor&s;hip towards God, as being their true right &s;o to do; and neither to do more in that, becau&s;e of outward incouragement from Men; nor any whit le&s;s, becau&s;e of the fear of their Laws and Acts again&s;t it.</HI> Thus for a Chri&s;tian Man to vindicate his ju&s;t Liberty, with &s;o much Boldne&s;s, and yet Innocency, will in due time, tho' through Blood, purcha&s;e Peace; as this Age has in &s;ome mea&s;ure Experienced, and many are Witne&s;&s;es of it; which yet &s;hall be more apparent to the World, as <HI>Truth</HI> takes place in the Earth. But they greatly &s;in again&s;t this excellent Rule, that in time of Per&s;ecu|tion do not profe&s;s their own way, &s;o much as they would, if it were otherwi&s;e; and yet, when they

can get the Magi&s;trate upon their &s;ide, not only &s;tretch their own Liberty to the utmo&s;t, but &s;eek to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;ame, by denying it to others.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Inno|cent Suffer|ings of the People call'd, <HI>Qua|kers.</HI></NOTE>But of this excellent Patience and Sufferings, the Witne&s;&s;es of God, in &s;corn called <HI>Quakers,</HI> have given a manife&s;t proof: For &s;o &s;oon as God re|vealed his <HI>Truth</HI> among them, without regard to all Oppo&s;ition, or what they might meet with, they went up and down, as they were moved of the Lord, preaching and propagating the <HI>Truth</HI> in Mar|ket-places, High ways, Streets, and publick Tem|ples, tho' daily beaten, whipped, brui&s;ed, halled and impri&s;oned therefor. And when there was any where a Church or A&s;&s;embly gathered, they taught them to keep their Meetings openly, and not to &s;hut the Door, nor do it by &s;tealth, that all might know it, and who would might enter. And as hereby all ju&s;t occa&s;ion of fear of Plotting again&s;t the Government was fully removed, &s;o this their Courage and Faithfulne&s;s, in not giving over their meeting together (but more e&s;pecially the Pre&s;ence and Glory of God, manife&s;ted in the Meeting, being terrible to the Con&s;ciences of the Per&s;ecutors) did &s;o weary out the Malice of their Adver&s;aries, that often-times they were forced to leave their Work undone. For when they came to break up a Meeting, they were forced to take every Individual out by force; they not being free to give up their Liberty, by di&s;&s;olving at their Com|mand; And when they were halled out, unle&s;s they were kept forth by Violence, they pre&s;ent|ly returned peaceably to their place. Yea, when &s;ometimes the Magi&s;trates have pulled down their Meeting-hou&s;es, they have met the next day openly upon the Rubbi&s;h, and &s;o by Innocency kept their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Ground, being properly their own, and their right to meet and wor&s;hip God being not forfeited to any. So that when Armed Men have come to di&s;&s;olve them, it was
<PB N="509" REF="003129_0261_0FF0065618A697B8">
impo&s;&s;ible for them to do it, unle&s;s they had killed every one; for they &s;tood &s;o clo&s;e together, that no force could move any one to &s;tir, until vio|lently pull'd thence: So that when the Malice of their Oppo&s;ers &s;tirred them to take Shovels, and throw the Rubbi&s;h upon them, there they &s;tood unmoved, being willing, if the Lord &s;hould &s;o per|mit, to have been there buried alive, witne&s;&s;ing for him. As this Patient, but yet Couragious way of Suffering, made the Per&s;ecutors work very heavy and weari&s;om unto them; &s;o the Courage and Pa|tience of the Sufferers, u&s;ing no Re&s;i&s;tance, nor bringing any Weapons to defend them&s;elves, not &s;eeking any ways Revenge upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, did &s;ecretly &s;mite the Hearts of the Per&s;ecutors, and made their Chariot-wheels go on heavily: Thus after much and many kind of Sufferings thus pati|ently born, which to rehear&s;e would make a Vo|lume of it &s;elf, which may in due time be pub|li&s;hed to the Nations, (for we have them upon Record) a kind of <HI>Negative Liberty</HI> has been ob|tained, &s;o that at pre&s;ent for the mo&s;t part we meet together without di&s;turbance from the Magi|&s;trate. But on the contrary, mo&s;t <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> when they have not the allowance and toleration of the Magi&s;trate, meet only in &s;ecret, and hide their Te&s;timony; and if they be di&s;covered, if there be any probability of making their e&s;cape by force (or &s;uppo&s;e it were by cutting off tho&s;e that &s;eek them out) they will do it; whereby they lo&s;e the Glory of their Sufferings, by not appearing as the innocent Followers of Chri&s;t, nor having a Te&s;ti|mony of their Harmle&s;ne&s;s in the Hearts of their Pur&s;uers; their Fury, by &s;uch re&s;i&s;tance, is the more kindled again&s;t them. As to this la&s;t part, of re&s;i&s;ting &s;uch as per&s;ecute them, they can lay claim to no Precept from Chri&s;t, nor any Exam|ple of him, or his Apo&s;tles approved.</P>

<P>See how clearly and evidently the&s;e Men wit|ne&s;s, that this Form of Speaking, and the&s;e pro|fane Titles, derive their Origin from the ba&s;e Flattery of the&s;e la&s;t Ages, and from the delicate

Haughtine&s;s of Worldly Men who have invented the&s;e Novelties, that thereby they might Honour one another, under I know not what pretence of Civility and Re&s;pect. From whence many of the pre&s;ent Chri&s;tians (&s;o accounted) are become &s;o Perver&s;e, in commending mo&s;t wicked Men, and wicked Cu&s;toms, that the <HI>Simplicity</HI> of the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> is wholly lo&s;t; &s;o that the giving of Men and Things their own Names, is not only worn out of Cu&s;tom, but the doing thereof is accounted Ab&s;urd and Rude, by &s;uch kind of delicate Para&s;ites, who de|&s;ire to a&s;cribe to this Flattery, and abu&s;e the Name of Civility. Moreover, that this way of &s;peaking proceeds from a high and proud Mind, hence ap|pears; becau&s;e that Men commonly u&s;e the Singular Number to Beggars, and to their Servants; yea, and in their Prayers to God. Thus the Superiour will &s;peak to his Inferiour, who yet will not bear, that the Inferiour &s;o &s;peak to him, as judging it a kind of Reproach unto him. So hath the Pride of Men placed God and the Beggar in the &s;ame Category.

<P><HI>Secondly; Men, being alike by Creation,</HI> (tho' their being &s;tated under their &s;everal Relations, requires from them mutual Services, according to tho&s;e re|&s;pective Relations) <HI>owe not Wor&s;hip to one another, but all equally are to return it to God: Becau&s;e it is to him, and his Name alone, that every Knee mu&s;t bow, and before who&s;e Throne the four &amp; Twenty Elders pro&s;trate them&s;elves.</HI> Therefore for Men, to take this one from another, is to rob God of his Glory: Since all the duties of Relations may be performed one to another, without the&s;e kind of Bowings, which therefore are no e&s;&s;ential part of our Duty to Man, but to God. All Men, by an inward in&s;tinct, in all Nations, have been led to pro&s;trate and bow them&s;elves to God. And it is plain, that this Bow|ing to Men took place from a <HI>&s;lavi&s;h fear</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;ome, which led them to &s;et up others as Gods; when al&s;o an ambitious proud Spirit got up in tho&s;e others, to u&s;urp the place of God, over their Brethren.</P>

not blame him for it: The ab&s;taining from Super|fluities, which his Condition and Education have accu&s;tomed him to, may be in him a greater Act of Mortification, than the ab&s;taining from finer Cloaths in the Servant, who was never accu&s;tom|ed to them. As to the Country, what it naturally produces, may be no Vanity to the Inhabitants to u&s;e, or what is commonly imparted to them by way of Exchange; &s;eeing it is without doubt, that the Creation is for the u&s;e of Man. So where Silk abounds, it may be worn, as well as Wool; and were we in tho&s;e Countries, or near unto them, where <HI>Gold</HI> or <HI>Silver</HI> were as common as <HI>Iron</HI> or <HI>Bra&s;s,</HI> the one might be u&s;ed as well as the other.

<HEAD>The <HI>CONCLUSION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IF in God's Fear, <HI>Candid Reader,</HI> thou applye&s;t thy &s;elf to con&s;ider this Sy&s;tem of Religion, here delivered, with its Con&s;i&s;tency and Harmony, as well in it &s;elf, as with the Scriptures of Truth, I doubt not, but thou wilt &s;ay with me, and many more, That this is the Spiritual Day of Chri&s;t's Appear|ance, wherein he is again Revealing the Ancient Paths of Truth and Righteou&s;ne&s;s. For thou may'&s;t ob&s;erve here the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> in all its parts, truly E&s;tabli&s;hed and Vindicated, as it is a Living, Inward, Spiritual, Pure and Sub&s;tantial Thing; and not a meer Form, Shew, Shadow, Notion and O|pinion, as too many have hitherto held it, who&s;e Fruits declare, they wanted that which they bear the Name of: And yet many of tho&s;e are &s;o in love with their empty Forms and Shadows, that they cea&s;e not to calumniate us for commending, and cal|ling them to the Sub&s;tance; as if we therefore de|nied or neglected the true Form and outward Part of Chri&s;tianity, which indeed is (as God, the Searcher of Hearts, knows) a very great Slander. Thus, be|cau&s;e we have de&s;ired People earne&s;tly to feel after God <HI>near,</HI> and <HI>in them&s;elves,</HI> telling them, That their Notions of God, as he is beyond the Clouds, will little avail them, if they do not feel him near: Hence they have &s;ought maliciou&s;ly to infer, that we deny any God, except that which is within us. Becau&s;e we tell People, That it is the <HI>Light</HI> and the <HI>Law within,</HI> and not the <HI>Letter without,</HI> that can truly tell them their Condition, and lead them out

of all Evil: Hence they &s;ay, we vilifie the Scrip|tures, and &s;et up our own Imaginations above them. Becau&s;e we tell them, That it is not their talking or believing of Chri&s;t's outward Life, Sufferings, Death and Re&s;urrection, no more than the <HI>Jews</HI> crying, <HI>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord,</HI> that will &s;erve their turn, or ju&s;tify them in the &s;ight of God; but that they mu&s;t know <HI>Chri&s;t in them,</HI> whom they have crucified, to be rai&s;ed, and to ju&s;tifie them and redeem them from their Ini|quities: Hence they &s;ay, We deny the Life, Death and Sufferings of Chri&s;t, Ju&s;tification by his Blood, and Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins through him. Becau&s;e we tell them, while they are talking and deter|mining about the <HI>Re&s;urrection,</HI> that they have more need to know the <HI>Ju&s;t One,</HI> whom they have &s;lain, <HI>rai&s;ed in them&s;elves,</HI> and to be &s;ure they are Partak|kers of the <HI>fir&s;t Re&s;urrection</HI>; and that if this be, they will be the more capable to judge of the <HI>Se|cond</HI>: Hence they &s;ay, That we deny the Re&s;ur|rection of the Body. Becau&s;e, when we hear them talk fooli&s;hly of Heaven and Hell, and the la&s;t Judg|ment, we exhort them to come out of that Helli&s;h Condition they are in, and come down to the Judg|ment of Chri&s;t <HI>in their own Hearts,</HI> and believe in the Light, and follow it, that &s;o they may come to &s;it in the <HI>heavenly places,</HI> that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us: Hence they maliciou&s;ly &s;ay, That we deny any Heaven or Hell, but that which is within us, and that we deny any general Judgment: Which <HI>Slan|ders,</HI> the Lord knows, are foully ca&s;t upon us, whom God hath rai&s;ed for this end, and gathered us, that by us he might confound the Wi&s;dom of the Wi&s;e, and bring to nought the Under&s;tanding of the Prudent; and might, in and by his own Spirit and Power in a de&s;pi&s;ed People, (that no Fle&s;h might glory in his pre&s;ence) pull down that dead, dark, corrupt Image, and meer Shadow and Shell of Chri&s;tianity, wherewith Antichri&s;t hath deceived

<Q>Unto him that hath begun this Work, not among the Rich or Great Ones, but among the Poor and Small, and hath Revealed it not to the Wi&s;e and Learned, but unto the Poor, unto Babes and Sucklings; even to Him, the only wi&s;e and omnipotent GOD, be Ho|nour, Glory, Thank&s;giving and Renown, from hence|forth and for ever. <HI>Amen.
