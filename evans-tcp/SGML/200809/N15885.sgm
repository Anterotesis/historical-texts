<HEAD>SERMON I. <HI>The</HI> GREAT MEDIATOR <HI>of the</HI> EVERLASTING COVENANT.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Preached at GRACE-CHURCH-STREET, <DATE>APRIL 25, 1688</DATE>.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOW &s;hould we all admire the workings of the Holy Gho&s;t! You may know from your own experi|ence, that all the operations of the Holy Spirit, from the beginning, have been in order to the clean&s;ing, and pu|rifying, and preparing you for the kingdom of God. This experience is given to a little remnant, to know that the man|ner of his working, that the end, aim and de&s;ign, of all the operations of his power, is for our good, and in order to our eternal happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Now, this is a great engagement upon the minds of the people of God, diligently to wait upon him, that they may be opened more and more into the my&s;tery of life and &s;alva|tion, that hath been hid from ages and generations, and is now revealed by his &s;pirit.</P>
<P>And they that are thus exerci&s;ed with the mea&s;ure of grace given unto them, they do grow and encrea&s;e in holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, by the working thereof; and they encrea&s;e in knowledge in the great things of the law, and the my&s;teries of the kingdom of grace: By the eye which God hath opened, they di&s;cern, that the working of his power in all ages, has been for the extirpating, rooting out and de&s;troying of that root of iniquity, that hath brought forth &s;uch a crop of &s;in and wickedne&s;s, which was not of his planting, nor of his creating.</P>
<P>For, from the beginning of the creation of God, unto this day, God hath had a &s;ingular love and favour to the &s;ons and daughters of men, as being (as I may &s;ay) the ma&s;ter-piece, or greate&s;t piece of the creation, mo&s;t nearly related to him&s;elf, created in his own image, in righte|ou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="4" REF="020309_0004_0FAEF6524EF5E520">
and holine&s;s; and in that they now are not &s;o, but marred, and &s;poiled from bearing the heavenly image, is not the Lord's doing, but hath been wrought by the enemy both to God and man; yet the Lord continuing his love unto the work of his hands, hath from age to age re|vealed and made known his power, for the re&s;toring and bringing back again lo&s;t man, fallen man, &s;inful man, to be reconciled unto him; that he may, as was intended, enjoy and po&s;&s;e&s;s the love and favour of his Maker; but there was no po&s;&s;ibility found for his reconciliation with the holy God, but by making him holy: For as the making him unholy, &s;eperated him from his Maker; &s;o the making of him holy again, would unite him again unto his Maker: So that there mu&s;t be a way and means for the reducing of him to his primitive &s;tate, before he could enjoy and obtain his primitive enjoyments; that is, the love and favour of God: And there hath been a ge|neral univer&s;al &s;en&s;e, upon the &s;ons and daughters of men, of this alienation, and e&s;trangedne&s;s from God; and they have put them&s;elves upon divers ways and methods to ob|tain reconciliation, and to try if they could re&s;tore them|&s;elves; and they have found out ways, and tried and proved the inventions and imaginations of their own minds, in their fallen wi&s;dom, what they might do to plea&s;e God, and be reconciled to him.</P>
<P>We are &s;inners, and we will &s;acrifice, we will bring a &s;acri|fice for our &s;ins; and when men have brought a &s;acrifice, it hath not been accepted, becau&s;e there hath not been a Medi|ator known, that might mediate for them with the Lord; &s;o that all the &s;acrifices they have offered, have never been ac|cepted with him, in order to an atonement and reconcili|ation. Now only tho&s;e that have relation to the Mediator by faith in him, doth he intercede for, that he might pre&s;ent them again to God; and this hath been the difference between &s;acrificer and &s;acrifice, from the days of <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel,</HI> unto this day. Some have had relation to the Mediator in all their &s;ervices and &s;acrifices, and &s;ome have had relation only to the thing offered, and the &s;ervice performed; but they have not in all ages &s;ped alike: They who&s;e &s;ervice and wor&s;hip was performed to God, with a relation to the Mediator, they
<PB N="5" REF="020309_0005_0FAEF6531B0E25C0">
have found acceptance; and they who&s;e wor&s;hip and &s;ervice was performed only with a relation to the thing offered or done, that was but their own act, that was but their will-wor&s;hip, and that was always turned back again upon them; <HI>for there is no name given under Heaven, by which any can be &s;aved, but only the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> that is the Mediator of the new covenant, for the old one was broken: And when <HI>Aaron</HI> was &s;et up to be an high-prie&s;t to God, he was appointed to offer &s;acrifices for the &s;ins of the people, and he that committed a &s;in, was appointed by the law to bring an he-goat of the flock unto the door of the tabernacle, and to deliver it to the prie&s;t, and he was to make an offering for the &s;in committed after &s;uch and &s;uch a manner, and it was to be an atonement with God for him: So here was &s;eeming|ly, a reconciliation by a &s;acrifice; and &s;ome &s;aw no further than the bringing of a goat, and a ram, and the performance of the prie&s;t's office, and they counted all was well: And others &s;aw farther, long before the apo&s;tle &s;pake or wrote it, <HI>it was not the blood of bulls or goats, nor the blood of a ram, that could purge away &s;in from their con&s;ciences.</HI> And after the apo&s;tle had opened the my&s;tery of Divinity, who had a divine and &s;piritual skill, in unfolding the re&s;toration of mankind, he declared plainly, that <HI>when the offering was made by</HI> Aaron <HI>for &s;inners, even then there remained &s;till a con&s;cience of &s;in; for it was not po&s;&s;ible that the blood of bulls and goats, &s;hould take away &s;in:</HI> So that their outward performances, and their outward &s;ervices, they did but point out the Mediator; they had a pointing finger, as it were, to the real, true and ever|la&s;ting Mediator, Chri&s;t Je&s;us; who is made a Mediator betwixt God and man; that by and through him, man might be again reconciled to God.</P>
<P>So that now in the&s;e go&s;pel-days, wherein God is opening the my&s;teries of life and &s;alvation, to the intent and pur|po&s;e, that the &s;ons and daughters of men might be re&s;tored again into their primitive enjoyment of the favour of God; now in the&s;e days, it is the duty of all Chri&s;tians, and of all that are &s;eeking the welfare of their immortal &s;ouls, to have their eyes and hearts unto Je&s;us, as unto one that is able to reconcile them unto God; to him it is committed, to him wi&s;dom and power is committed, and to him authority is
<PB N="6" REF="020309_0006_0FAEF653D01A8F00">
committed, that he &s;hould be an everla&s;ting high-prie&s;t; and that all the &s;ervices, and all the wor&s;hip and religious per|formances that people offer up to God, &s;hould be in his name, that &s;o by him they might be recommended to God: For none will find acceptance with the Father, unle&s;s in all their performances they have an eye unto him.</P>
<P>So that it comes plainly to pa&s;s, according to that &s;hort and confident a&s;&s;ertion of the author to the <HI>Hebrews, that without faith, it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God:</HI> But it is po&s;&s;ible to offer &s;acrifices without faith, and po&s;&s;ible for people to perform religious &s;ervices without faith, as woful experience hath taught us in our days, that many have been exerci&s;ed in a kind of religious &s;ervice, that never in their lives had faith enough to believe the things that they pray for, and they are without faith. When people pray to God to &s;end his Holy Spirit into their hearts, that they may keep his com|mandments to their lives end, and have not faith to believe it, and when they pray, <HI>Thy will be done on earth, as it is in Heaven,</HI> it is a religious performance; but if it be not done in faith, it is but an encrea&s;ing in &s;in, and an addition to &s;in. Where is the man that is exerci&s;ed in praying to God, that believeth that ever &s;uch a thing is like to come to pa&s;s? Go where you will in this or the other nation, and enquire of people about their faith; they believe there is no po&s;&s;ibili|ty of extirpating and rooting out of &s;in, while they live upon the earth; therefore all their prayers for it are vain, and their faith a vain faith: And it is high time in &s;uch a day as this, when men are faithle&s;s and unbelieving, to preach up the object of faith, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. People are of di|vers faiths, and of divers beliefs; but we have found by ex|perience, that they do them no good, they do not bring a thing to pa&s;s, that of nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t be brought to pa&s;s, before they can be reconciled to God; their faith doth not clean&s;e the heart, nor extend &s;o far as to believe that ever they &s;hall be clean&s;ed; in all the wor&s;hip and religion that they per|form, they come not to this faith, that they &s;hall be made clean: All that is done is but in &s;in and uncleanne&s;s; they cannot bring a clean &s;acrifice out of an unclean ve&s;&s;el: And our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;aith concerning this &s;ubject, <HI>an evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit;</HI> but there mu&s;t be good
<PB N="7" REF="020309_0007_0FAEF65489C1CD80">
fruit brought &s;orth; how mu&s;t we do it? <HI>Make the tree good, and the fruit will be good.</HI> When mens vain janglings about religion and religious fancies come to an end, then all this religion will appear to be in vain, and will not an&s;wer the end for which it is performed, till men believe that it will make the tree good, and clean&s;e the heart, and transform men by renewing the &s;pirit of their minds. So that religion mu&s;t begin within; and it is not our changing of forms of wor|&s;hip, from one form to another, and taking up this and the other opinion, that doth change our hearts. Sad experience doth teach us, that men may carry over their old lu&s;ts into a new religion; we can carry over our old inclinations into our new opinions: For though the form of wor&s;hip be changed, the heart remaining unchanged, and the lu&s;ts un|mortified, <HI>their religion is in vain,</HI> let them be of what per&s;ua&s;ion they will.</P>
<P>Now the remedy of this great calamity, that hath over|&s;pread all &s;orts of people; for there is no &s;ort of people, but there are tho&s;e among them that are under this great calamity, of holding the profe&s;&s;ion of godline&s;s with an ungodly mind, and the profe&s;&s;ion of truth with a fal&s;e and treacherous &s;pirit.</P>
<P>And for the remedying of this, there is but one way that all men be brought off from having their eye unto their performances, and to the doctrines and tenets that they hold, and do, as the apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>&s;ix their eye upon Chri&s;t, and look upon Je&s;us.</HI> This is the fir&s;t thing that mu&s;t begin our re|ligion; for Chri&s;t mu&s;t be the <HI>Alpha</HI> of our religion, as well as the <HI>Omega</HI> of it. If I begin not there, let me begin where I will, I begin wrong; let me begin at the mo&s;t &s;erious and &s;ound doctrine, and at the mo&s;t apo&s;tolical religion; if Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles were here upon the earth; if I walked among them; if I believed all they &s;aid and did, I &s;hould begin wrong, if I did not fix mine eye upon Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that is the taker away of &s;in, and is the &s;anctifier of the &s;oul by his Spirit. There mu&s;t be the beginning, and there mu&s;t be the conclu&s;ion; he is the author, and the fini&s;her of all true faith. There are authors of other faiths: Men have their different faiths, and creeds, and articles, and they have expo&s;|ed and impo&s;ed them too; but this is the wor&s;t of it, none of
<PB N="8" REF="020309_0008_0FAEF6555F6C4BD8">
them are right; let them be expo&s;ed and impo&s;ed with ever &s;o much force and violence, none of the&s;e will clean&s;e the heart; but that faith which is delivered over by Chri&s;t Je&s;us, that hath the quality of clean&s;ing and purifying; that is the faith when all is done, that will do the work; that is it that will &s;ave and &s;anctify, and do the bu&s;ine&s;s that all the world is about. Every one would have a reconciler with God, and &s;in rooted out, and be as God would have them be; this is the public profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tendom; at lea&s;t they would find out &s;omething by which it might be done: Altho' many are willing enough to continue in &s;in and drunk|enne&s;s, whoredom, lying and hypocri&s;y; the&s;e are a &s;ort of <HI>fools,</HI> that <HI>make a mock of &s;in,</HI> and that &s;wim in the &s;tream of plea&s;ure; and what care they, &s;o long as they make a profe&s;&s;ion of chri&s;tianity?</P>
<P>But I am &s;peaking of a people that are &s;truggling under their corruptions; that would mortify &s;in, and &s;erve God in holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and do God's <HI>will on earth as it is done in Heaven;</HI> and do it not inform, but would have power to do it; and they have tried &s;everal ways to do it, and it is not done; and many have been at this work till grey hairs are upon their heads, and it is not done. Now God hath given Chri&s;t to make reconciliation; now how can we, that have the love of God extended to us, but extend our good-will to our friends, and &s;ignify to them, that all the travel and pains they are at, and all the prayers they make, will do nothing till they have their faith fixed upon Je&s;us, that is able to &s;ave and deliver them, <HI>and &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t all that come to God by him.</HI></P>
<P>But here &s;ome will object and &s;ay, it is true what you &s;ay, but is it needful to preach &s;uch doctrines to us? for we all believe in Chri&s;t, that is, the only Mediator and Saviour. We know that Chri&s;t Je&s;us is the only Mediator, and that unle&s;s he commends us to God, we cannot be accepted of him. This is our general doctrine, therefore what need it be urged and pre&s;&s;ed upon us, that are come into the faith already.</P>
<P>Let me &s;earch into the matter; it is of greater importance than to &s;earch into a bargain of worldly things. Men would fain have others open and di&s;cover to them wherein
<PB N="9" REF="020309_0009_0FAEF6560C2BD458">
they may be cheated, to prevent their being impo&s;ed on in a worldly bargain. I hope then they will hearken to know how, and wherein they may be deceived by them&s;elves, and deceived by others in matters of eternal concernment. There are no Prote&s;tants, but the reject any Mediator but Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and believe that no Mediator can reconcile them to God, but Chri&s;t alone, and they &s;ay he is the object of their faith. I would ask them this que&s;tion, whether they believe in Chri&s;t at a di&s;tance, or as pre&s;ent, really pre&s;ent with them? If their faith be hi&s;torical and at a di&s;tance, that they believe in Chri&s;t, as one born of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and was crucified and dead before they were born, and aro&s;e again, and a&s;cended into Heaven, and is &s;et at the right hand of God, if the rea&s;on of my belief be, that I have heard of this relation of Chri&s;t, or whether the rea&s;on be, becau&s;e by his Spirit, he hath vi&s;ited me in this age; the one is, I believe, becau&s;e good men have told me &s;o; but the other is, I be|lieve, becau&s;e, by this Spirit he hath promi&s;ed to &s;end, to lead me into all truth, he hath vi&s;ited me. Now let me examine whether I am aware of &s;uch a &s;piritual vi&s;itation, by this quickening Spirit, which is the Lord from Heaven, and not only the Lord in Heaven. Whether I am aware of &s;uch a quickening power and virtue, which I have received upon my &s;pirit, that he is not only at the right hand of God on high in Heaven, but is now come to knock at the door of my heart, and hath rai&s;ed in me a life, as oppo&s;ite to &s;in, as his was. Let me con&s;ider if I be aware of a &s;ecret touch of his quickening virtue upon my &s;oul, whereby he hath begotten me into a life oppo&s;ite to &s;in; &s;o that if &s;in remains, it remains as a burthen, and oppre&s;&s;ion upon me, &s;o that I am a &s;ufferer; for as much as I am quickened, and made &s;en|&s;ible of a better life, of a godly life, I would fain be at it, and live in it, but iniquity, lu&s;t and corruption lie in the way. He that hath quickened me &s;o far, as to bring me to a &s;en&s;e of the burthen of &s;in, my faith tells me, he will take the burthen off, el&s;e my faith will do me no good, if cor|ruption &s;till prevail upon me, if my faith tells me this, it will tell the wickede&s;t man in the world as much; but if my faith tells me I am a &s;inner, and my &s;ins con&s;i&s;t of this and the other evil thing I do, and am inclined to do, it tells
<PB N="10" REF="020309_0010_0FAEF656D4722950">
me again, that he that hath quickened me, and brought me to a &s;en&s;e of &s;in, he can take the burthen off from me.</P>
<P>Here now is a true faith, that begins in conviction, and ends in true conver&s;ion; this is the word of faith, delivered to the &s;aints, and which we are to preach. They &s;aid of old, that the word of faith, they had to preach, was that which was nigh in their mouth, that they might receive it, and do it. I have &s;omething nigh that reproves me for &s;in; if I be obedient to it, then faith gives me victory over that which is &s;inful, for which the world reproveth me; and as I &s;ee faith gives me victory over any corruption, which I have been &s;truggling under, I am encouraged to fix my faith upon him that hath thus quick|ened me: So that this is the difference between faith in Chri&s;t at a di&s;tance, and faith that quickeneth me by God's Spirit; that Spirit that hath been &s;o much &s;lighted in our days, by the highe&s;t notioni&s;ts in our age; they &s;uppo&s;ed it to be a meer fiction; &s;ome have mocked and derided, and others have been di&s;couraged to &s;peak of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, and his operation upon the &s;oul; &s;ome have declared both in the pre&s;s and pulpit, that they have had no experience of the touches of God's Spirit upon their &s;ouls. But our expe|rience hath brought us to another degree of knowledge. We know, and you may know if you plea&s;e, and that before you &s;leep, that there is a way opened, God has made way for his Spirit to reach the &s;pirits of men, to &s;ignify immediately to their &s;pirits without means, herein thou doe&s;t wrong, and herein thou maye&s;t have life, and &s;eek after it. Now the Spirit that thus worketh, is the Spirit of Chri&s;t, the Spirit that proceeds from the Father and the Son, that voice in men that tells them they might believe and be &s;aved. When he comes, &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>he will lead you into all truth.</HI> How &s;hall the world know this is he? <HI>He &s;hall convince them of &s;in.</HI> If there be any convincement that ari&s;eth in man of this and the other &s;in, it mu&s;t be from the way the Holy Spirit hath upon their &s;pirits; he hath a way to &s;peak to men, and every one that is a lover of his own &s;oul, is bound to hearken to that voice.</P>
<P><HI>In the latter days,</HI> &s;aith the Lord, <HI>when I &s;hall rai&s;e a prophet in the mid&s;t of you, who&s;oever will not hear that pro|phet, &s;hall it cut off.</HI> All commentators agree on this text,
<PB N="11" REF="020309_0011_0FAEF6578D8F7750">
that that prophet was no other than Chri&s;t Je&s;us; it was not <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t,</HI> nor <HI>Paul,</HI> nor <HI>Peter;</HI> but Chri&s;t that was promi&s;ed to be rai&s;ed. There was &s;uch an ab&s;olute com|mand went along with that prophecy, <HI>that all &s;hould hear him,</HI> and it had a threatening at the end of it, <HI>that all that will not hear him, &s;hall be cut off.</HI> Are they not whore|mongers, and drunkards, and liars, that will not hear this prophet? They will not hear him, becau&s;e they love their &s;ins. What becomes of them? They are cut off from the enjoyment of the love and favour of God, and when they draw nigh to God in prayer, and other religious exerci&s;es, it is with them, as it was with <HI>Cain, &s;in lies at the door.</HI> When they come into a &s;torm at &s;ea, or are arre&s;ted with &s;ickne&s;s, and death looks them in the face, they would have peace, but there is di&s;tre&s;s, and trouble in the room of it. What is the matter? Wa&s;t thou not bapti&s;ed in the Chri&s;|tian faith? Did not the mini&s;ter tell thee, <HI>that thou art a child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of Heaven?</HI> Alas! my &s;in lies at my door; O! that I had time to live a better life! What ails thy life, man? My life hath been a life of deceit, lu&s;t, and vanity, corruption and hypocri&s;y. Did not thy teacher teach thee, that a believer hath no guilt upon him, but that all his &s;ins are pardoned from the day he be|came a believer? This doctrine will not hold in a &s;torm, tho' it will do in fair weather; when men are &s;wimming in their plea&s;ures, it will &s;erve them; but when they come to deal with their Maker, no faith will &s;erve them, but that which <HI>purifies the heart,</HI> and that which makes a change <HI>from the earthly image to the heavenly.</HI></P>
<P>It were better for you and I, and every one of us, to take the&s;e things into con&s;ideration, while we have health and &s;trength, and while &s;ome &s;and (as I may &s;o &s;peak) is in our gla&s;&s;es, to con&s;ider what is my faith? What is the object of it? Have I a dependency upon my duties, and alms, and good deeds? They will fail me. But if my dependency be upon Chri&s;t as a Saviour, and a Sanctifier, and my &s;anctifica|tion is carried on gradually, <HI>he that hath begun a good work in me will perfect it.</HI> And if the rea&s;on of my going to meet|ings, and going into my clo&s;et, and bowing my&s;elf before the Lord, is to keep clo&s;e to him that carries on the work of

&s;anctification, <HI>he will work all my work in me and for me.</HI> I cannot expect to live in the world, but I &s;hall meet with temptations; the Devil will tempt me, but my Saviour will be nigh me, as nigh to me as the Devil can be; if I will keep clo&s;e to him, he will keep clo&s;e to me. <HI>My Father,</HI> &s;aith <HI>Chri&s;t, is greater than I, and none is able to pluck you out of your Father's hands.</HI> I mu&s;t expect to be tempted; <HI>for the adver&s;ary the Devil goes about like a roaring lion, &s;eeking whom he may devour.</HI> Alas! &s;aith one, though I have made &s;ome progre&s;s in the work of &s;anctification, yet for all that, he may one day betray me. Am I grown &s;trong enough to re&s;i&s;t his temptations? and wi&s;e enough to fore&s;ee all his gins and traps, which he lays to en&s;nare me? But I know who can &s;ee them, and defeat them. I have my faith fixed upon one that can bind the &s;trong man, and ca&s;t him out. The life that I now live, is not in my own parts, and by my own under&s;tanding and &s;en&s;e: <HI>But the life that I now live, in the fle&s;h, I live by the faith of the Son of God.</HI> This is that faith that gives me victory. The apo&s;tle had a battle for it; <HI>I have fought the good fight; and henceforth is laid up for me a crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and not for me only, but for all them that love the appearing of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> and that come to have familiarity with Chri&s;t, with his Spirit and truth, with his grace and word, in their hearts: Though the&s;e are &s;everal ex|pre&s;&s;ions, they all &s;ignify one immortal &s;eed of life, by which men are united to God: It is a leaven there, to leaven them into the Divine Nature.</P>
<P>Whenever &s;uch a one is tempted, he re&s;i&s;ts not the tempter in his own power, but he waits to feel the ari&s;ings of that life, and power, and virtue that was in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and is in him &s;till: He waits for that power, that in the name of Chri&s;t he may &s;ay, <HI>get thee behind me Satan.</HI> Being forti|fied by Chri&s;t's name, and armed with his power, what is it that a Chri&s;tian cannot do? What valiant, noble and wonderful things have they done, that have been &s;hielded with this faith? See the eleventh chapter of the epi&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews.</HI> All the repetitions of that chapter, from one end to the other; in all of them the apo&s;tle a&s;cribes all the valiantne&s;s and courageou&s;ne&s;s of tho&s;e noble acts, to the power of faith. They looked to Je&s;us, before ever the

<HI>Virgin Mary</HI> brought him forth out of her body. The prophets did earne&s;tly &s;eek to know tho&s;e things, which the Spirit of Chri&s;t that was in them, did &s;ignify unto them, that there was to be this great Prophet, before ever the <HI>Virgin Mary</HI> was born: So that Chri&s;t was always the object of a true believer's faith. Though under the law they had an high-prie&s;t, and he was placed at the altar, and they had offerings burnt upon it, yet they had an eye unto Chri&s;t, they had an undervaluing of all that their &s;acrifices could do for them. <HI>If thou woulde&s;t have had burnt offerings,</HI> &s;aith <HI>David, I would have given them; I would not have with|held them from thine altar; thou &s;houlde&s;t have had enough of them.</HI> He was bold to &s;ay, in re&s;pect of acceptance and reconciliation, <HI>burnt offerings and &s;acrifices thou woulde&s;t not; a body ha&s;t thou prepared me; for it is written in the volume of the book, I come to do thy will, O God.</HI> He had an eye unto Je&s;us that was to come, upon whom help was laid: There was a Redeemer, that &s;hould come from <HI>Zion,</HI> and a law-giver from <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> They had an eye beyond &s;acri|fices, unto Chri&s;t. In all ages the people of God have had the an&s;wer of their &s;ouls, which is reconciliation, and the favour of God: They that had this an&s;wer, never had it but by Chri&s;t. No man can be accepted with God, can ever have the de&s;ire of his &s;oul an&s;wered in peace and recon|ciliation with God, until his faith be placed on Chri&s;t Je&s;us: Neither can any man have faith in Chri&s;t at a di&s;tance, and thereby be reconciled unto God, but mu&s;t know his Spirit. I mu&s;t have an experimental knowledge of his power and wi&s;dom, and this I cannot have without his Spirit: Let me believe ever &s;o othordoxly, except I have the Spirit of Chri&s;t, it will do me no good, it will be no advantage to me.</P>
<P>This is the word, that was in my heart as a well-wi&s;her to the &s;ouls of all men: As God hath done good to my &s;oul, &s;o I cannot but wi&s;h well to the &s;ouls of others; that as he hath found out a way for my redemption and &s;alvation, &s;o likewi&s;e I wi&s;h the &s;ame for others that are bond-men and bond-women, and under the power of their corruption. God's work hath been to de&s;troy the bondage and the op|pre&s;&s;ion, and to de&s;troy the tyrant that reigns over the &s;ouls of people; God having made them for his glory, and the Devil has &s;tolen them away: That they do not that which

plea&s;eth God: But God's good plea&s;ure is, that all <HI>may be &s;aved, and come to the knowledge of the truth: And God &s;o loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life:</HI> And he is called, <HI>the Lamb of God, which takes away the &s;ins of the world.</HI> He can take away &s;in; if my &s;in do not ob&s;truct my faith and confidence in him, he will take it away; and if he takes that away, then he makes the tree good. Nothing hinders us from the enjoyment of God, but &s;in; and if Chri&s;t will take it away by the blood of his cro&s;s, no matter for all the &s;corn, contempt, hard&s;hip, reproach and per&s;ecution of this world; no matter, for he hath not de|ceived us, but told us before hand, if we will be followers of him, and be led by him; we mu&s;t expect the&s;e things; &s;ufferings, reproaches, per&s;ecutions, di&s;dain and envy. The&s;e things come not uncertainly upon us; the world loves its own, and cannot love them that are not of it; but they that are not of the world, may be brought to the terms of God, and they may not be any longer in the world. Chri&s;t pray|eth not that his di&s;ciples may be taken out of the world, but kept from the evil: So that Chri&s;t is a Mediator, and a propitiation for all men; and he is working by his Spirit for the redemption of all men, <HI>that to as many as believe in him, to them he gives power to become the Sons of God.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;um of all this is, that we have an opportunity put into our hands; we cannot deny it; you mu&s;t all upon &s;earch, confe&s;s, that the grace of God doth often work in your hearts again&s;t any corruption, again&s;t any evil: Let not this price be put into your hands in vain, as into the hands of fools. If I knew that this and that was a &s;in, I would leave it; let us be of that mind, and we &s;hall &s;oon know it; and then &s;ay, if I knew &s;uch a thing to be a &s;in, and could get a thou&s;and pounds by it, I would not do it, Why &s;hould'&s;t thou love &s;in for profit or plea&s;ure? I am &s;ure it is an ill bargain when it is done. What&s;oever I am convinced is a &s;in, I will not do it.</P>
<P>Re&s;olve upon this, and then the grace of God will be at work; we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee that we mu&s;t leave off &s;inning. There is &s;uch a thing I mu&s;t leave; God hath &s;et up a judg|ment in my mind again&s;t it; though it bring profit and plea&s;ure, away it mu&s;t go. Here is a &s;tep, a following &s;tep,

Here the &s;oul is led &s;tep by &s;tep, even by Chri&s;t, the Captain of our Salva|tion, till it is gradually clean&s;ed from &s;in, and reconciled unto God; and this can be done by no other means; for prayers and alms will not do it; all that can be done by us will not do it; none can do it but Chri&s;t alone, that God hath laid help upon, that you may all wait for the Divine operation of his grace in your hearts. That is it which we labour and travel for, as knowing that God hath wrought wonderfully by it, for the redemption of all tho&s;e that love him more than they love their plea&s;ures, more than they love their &s;ins. It mu&s;t be concluded, that following of him, and leav|ing father and mother, hu&s;band and wife, children, brethren, and &s;i&s;ters; all the&s;e things as they &s;tand in competition with him, and the obedience of his Spirit, mu&s;t be looked upon as nothing to him: Then above all things, I mu&s;t not di&s;plea&s;e him: <HI>He can &s;peak peace, and none can take it away; and if he take it away, none can give it.</HI> If we follow Chri&s;t, when this is done, then all is done according to the will of God; then the ble&s;&s;ing de&s;cends upon the whole creation; then every man will &s;peak truth to his neighbour, and every man will govern his family with di&s;cretion; &s;o God is glorified, and his name comes to be exalted; who is worthy to be beloved, adored, and exalted above all ble&s;&s;ings and prai&s;es.

<HEAD>SERMON II. HEART PREPARATION <HI>for receiving the</HI> GOSPEL.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Preached at DEVONSHIRE-HOUSE, <DATE>FEB. 12, 1687.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>IT is in my heart at this time, to de&s;ire that every one's heart were prepared to be made a partaker of the ble&s;|&s;ings of the go&s;pel; for there is a certain preparation that every one mu&s;t witne&s;s in them&s;elves, before they are capable of receiving divine ble&s;&s;ings; for in all ages of the world, the ble&s;&s;ings of the Lord have been manifold, and his arm hath been always &s;tretched out in all ages, to the &s;ons and daughters of men, that are &s;en&s;ible of the love he hath unto them; and where the&s;e tenders of the love of God have met with prepared hearts, they have received it to their eter|nal welfare: But this hath been the lamentation that hath been taken up upon the greate&s;t part of mankind, that they have not been prepared to receive the love of God; their hearts and minds have been &s;o filled with the love of vi&s;ible things, and carnal objects, that they have not been truly &s;en|&s;ible of the riches of the grace, mercy, and love of God unto them.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="020309_0018_0FAEF65F30770738">Now, it was &s;aid of old by the prophet, <HI>that the prepa|ration of the heart is of the Lord;</HI> and there is &s;omething that belongs to us on our part, that we may attain this prepara|tion, that we may be brought into this &s;piritual frame of mind; and that is, by returning to the Lord, for people to think upon his name, and have regard to his appearance: And although this is not the work of nature, for by nature the minds of people are abroad, and they are crying out as the P&s;almi&s;t &s;peaks, <HI>who will &s;hew us any good?</HI> Yet to help that defect, the Lord hath been plea&s;ed to &s;end forth his grace and his truth, and to call unto the &s;ons and daughters of men, that they might &s;eek after him, that they might <HI>&s;eek the Lord while he is to be found;</HI> and they that hearken to his voice, they will readily confe&s;s, that there is nothing doth &s;o well &s;atisfy an immortal &s;oul, as to be gathered into fellow&s;hip with its Maker; and that one time or other, it is the de&s;ire of all men and women, that they might attain peace with the Lord; and they know there is no peace to the wicked; they know wickedne&s;s will remain until it is aboli&s;hed and de|&s;troyed; and they know it is not in their power to de&s;troy it; and therefore of nece&s;&s;ity there mu&s;t be a waiting upon the Lord, who is <HI>Almighty,</HI> that he may reveal his power in our weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>And they that are thus prepared in their minds, meet reli|giou&s;ly together, with expectation from God; that he, accor|ding to his promi&s;e, will appear, and reveal his arm, and do in them, and for them, that which they cannot do for them&s;elves; this is a fit occa&s;ion for people to meet together, and to have their expectation from God, and &s;ay, Lord, thou knowe&s;t my weakne&s;s, and thou knowe&s;t the enemies I have to deal withal; thou knowe&s;t I am not able to overcome them: Therefore we are now met together, in the pre&s;ence of the Lord, to wait to receive at his hands, that power, that life, that virtue, by which we may be made more than con|querors. Such a religious meeting thus gathered together, hath a promi&s;e; <HI>I will be in the mid&s;t of them,</HI> &s;aith the Lord; and therefore, having a promi&s;e, we may rea&s;onably expect that we &s;hall be made partakers of the living virtue and pow|er, by which we may do that, which of our&s;elves we cannot do.</P>

All tho&s;e objects that people fix their mind upon, they will wax old; but they who&s;e de&s;ires, and the breathings of who&s;e &s;ouls are, that they may grow into acquaintance with their Maker, this will never wax old.

<P>Now they that feel in them&s;elves that the rea&s;on of their meeting together is to enjoy the light of God's countenance, and to partake of the ble&s;&s;ings of God, they have their ex|pectation from God, their minds are retired into God; know|ing right well, that if the tongues of men and angels are mov|ed to declare the heavenly and divine my&s;teries of the king|dom of God, they cannot be edified or benefited by them with|out the divine help and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God's Spirit; for there is a <HI>&s;eal</HI> upon them, and none can open that <HI>&s;eal,</HI> but the <HI>Lyon</HI> of the tribe of <HI>Judah;</HI> he only is found worthy to un&s;eal the my&s;tery, and un&s;eal the divine ble&s;&s;ings that are with the Lord: So that people mu&s;t come to that retiredne&s;s of &s;pirit, to that re&s;ignation of &s;oul, to be as a little child waiting upon the Lord, crying out unto the Lord, that he will prepare them, <HI>that he will make them hungry, and then feed them, that he will rai&s;e a thir&s;t in them, and then &s;atisfy them with tho&s;e divine &s;prings of life, which through the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t are opened to every one that believeth.</HI> So far as your minds are &s;tayed and &s;ettled in waiting for the Lord, &s;o far you will feel in your&s;elves an openne&s;s and readine&s;s, that if the Lord &s;peaks, you are ready to hear him, ready to &s;ubmit to his word, ready to obey him; there will be &s;uch an openne&s;s in the mind, not to the words of any man, but unto the word of

God, to receive that; for where the words of men are receiv|ed, though never &s;o excellent, they convert not the &s;oul, <HI>but the word of the Lord is pure, converting the &s;oul.</HI> And this word is that which is able to quicken tho&s;e that are dead in &s;ins and tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, and bring them to be made partakers of life.

<P>O powerful Father! for this end, make bare thine arm unto the rulers and governors of the&s;e nations, that they may know thy coun&s;els, and bow to thy heavenly will, and may promote thy law of righteou&s;ne&s;s in their own hearts, and the hearts of others; that by thy power, a ble&s;&s;ed reformation may be wrought, and a &s;top put to iniquity; that it may not run down in a mighty &s;tream, as it hath done in time pa&s;t; but that truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;ound judgment may be known in the earth: That they that hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s, may have their &s;ouls de&s;ires &s;atisfied; and &s;o prai&s;e and thank&s;givings &s;hall ari&s;e from their &s;ouls to thee.</P>
<P>O powerful Father of Life! pre&s;erve and keep thy children, whom thou ha&s;t gathered, and purged, and purified, and to whom thou ha&s;t made known the way of life, and made them a willing people in the day of thy power, to do thy will, and to wait for the coming of that kingdom that thou ha&s;t promi&s;ed to e&s;tabli&s;h under Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords; and
<PB N="22" REF="020309_0022_0FAEF6651800B6E0">
that it may grow, and increa&s;e, and be &s;pread abroad upon the earth, and let every one de&s;ire to be the &s;ubject thereof.</P>
<P>Powerful Father of Life! the arm of thy power and in|vi&s;ible &s;trength hath been revealed, that nothing hath been able to re&s;i&s;t or &s;tand again&s;t and prevail, by which thou art planting <HI>Zion</HI> and building <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and e&s;tabli&s;hing it: By the &s;ame power, let thy work be carried on, and let many be brought in to be &s;ubject to Chri&s;t, for the good of their immortal &s;ouls: As thou ha&s;t multiplied thy ble&s;&s;ings upon us, &s;o from day to day thou ha&s;t made us &s;en&s;ible of thy love unto us, owning us to be thy children and peculiar people, by thy pre&s;ence in the mid&s;t of us, whenever we meet in thy name to wait upon thee, that &s;o, Living Father, all thine, both here and every where, may be encouraged to attend upon thee, and to be faithful to thy power; that waiting for the opening of thy coun&s;els, and the enlighten|ing their under&s;tandings, they may be able to comprehend, with all &s;aints, the height, and depth, and length, and breadth of thy love in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; that in the &s;en&s;e of the freene&s;s and greatne&s;s thereof, all thy children here and every where, that in an everla&s;ting covenant of grace thou ha&s;t gathered to thy|&s;elf may have communion with thee and thy Son and Spirit; and may return thee the honor, glory, and prai&s;e of all thy love, and mercy, and grace; for thou alone art worthy, who art God ever all, ble&s;&s;ed forever and ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SERMON III. <HI>The</HI> FIRST <HI>and</HI> GREAT COMMANDMENT.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Preached at DEVONSHIRE-HOUSE, <DATE>May 27, 1688.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>WHEN God gave forth his <HI>Law</HI> on <HI>Mount Sinai,</HI> which <HI>I&s;rael</HI> was to hear and obey, the fir&s;t and great commandment was, <HI>thou &s;halt have no other Gods before me.</HI> Here is the &s;um and &s;ub&s;tance of all <HI>true reli|gion</HI> that ever was upon earth to this day. All the command|ments, all the precepts, prophecies, and all the dealings of God with his people, from that day to this, have all been contained in this &s;hort precept, <HI>thou &s;halt have no other Gods
<PB N="23" REF="020309_0023_0FAEF666A5720388">
but me.</HI> And as long as <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;tood in obedience to this command, their ble&s;&s;ings were multiplied upon them, their good things were increa&s;ed from day to day; the Lord was with them, as long as they were willing to be his people; he appeared as their <HI>God,</HI> and as their defender wrought their deliverances, <HI>fought all their battles</HI> for them, gave them dominion and &s;trength, courage and wi&s;dom; mini&s;tered out of his <HI>trea&s;ury</HI> all good things unto them; for the great care of God Almighty was with all his people, he had regard to them, and vi&s;ited them at all times, to keep them from idolatry; <HI>I am,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>a jealous God,</HI> take notice of me to be &s;o; I am jealous of my name; if thou wilt be mine, <HI>thou &s;halt have no other Gods but me.</HI></P>
<P>And all the precepts about offerings and &s;acrifices, and making atonement for &s;inners, and the divers &s;ervices and wor&s;hip, the various offices in the temple and <HI>&s;anctuary,</HI> they were all outward means appointed of God, to keep this outward church in an inward conformity to the command of God. This command was written in tables of &s;tone, and the&s;e tables were laid up in the <HI>ark of God,</HI> and all this appertained to the <HI>fir&s;t covenant,</HI> and typed and figured out the di&s;pen&s;ation of the <HI>new and everla&s;ting covenant</HI> that God would make with his people, not like unto the old: How not like it? Not like it in the outward &s;hadows, the types and &s;hadows of things, but he would bring forth the &s;ub&s;tance of all tho&s;e <HI>&s;hadows</HI> and <HI>types,</HI> and would alter the form and outward appearance of things; <HI>for as God is unchangeable,</HI> &s;o is his <HI>law</HI> unchangeable.</P>
<P><HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;aith, the fir&s;t and great commandment is, <HI>Thou &s;halt have no other Gods but me.</HI> This was put into the &s;tone tables. Chri&s;t Je&s;us &s;aith, the fir&s;t and great commandment is, <HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy mind,</HI> Matt. xxii, 27. This is put into the <HI>tables of the heart.</HI> So here is a difference between the fir&s;t command|ment by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and the fir&s;t commandment by <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> they both acknowledge the fir&s;t and great command to be the &s;ub|jecting of the creature to him that made him, as his God, that he may only &s;erve him, and that he may love him with his whole heart: The <HI>Jew</HI> could prove this by his <HI>&s;tone tables,</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> proves this by the fle&s;hly tables of the heart, for
<PB N="24" REF="020309_0024_0FAEF66753C0EE38">
there he is bound to love the Lord with his whole heart, and to &s;erve him only; <HI>him only &s;halt thou &s;erve.</HI></P>
<P>Now, here the Jews law is brought over to the Chri&s;tians, in the greate&s;t point of religion that ever was preached; &s;huts out all idolatry, all &s;uper&s;tition, all variety of religions; all is &s;hut out by this commandment, and the Chri&s;tian that hath the law written in his heart, according to the new covenant, he can go as readily to it and read it, as ever the Jew could go to his <HI>&s;tone table,</HI> and read the law there; you cannot de|ny, that if there be a thing written and engraven in my heart, I can go at readily to it as I can go to any book or table, tho' I have the keeping of it: But the Jews had not the keeping of it, for generally it was laid up iij the <HI>ark of God.</HI></P>
<P>Now, friends, that which lies upon my mind to &s;peak to you at this time, and that out of the great love that I have to all your precious and immortal &s;ouls, as God hath had <HI>love to mine,</HI> is, that you would all con&s;ider and weigh in the fear of the Lord, who&s;e pre&s;ence is among us, which of you, and how many of you are come to the obedience of this com|mandment: I do not doubt but the mo&s;t of you can &s;ay them <HI>all,</HI> but a happy people are you if you can do <HI>one:</HI> I dare pronounce that &s;oul a ble&s;&s;ed &s;oul, that can perform this one commandment, that can or dare &s;tand before his <HI>Maker, and &s;ay, O Lord! I love thee with all my heart, with all my &s;oul, and with all my might;</HI> my love is withdrawn from all other things in compari&s;on of thee; there is nothing in this whole world hath a place in my mind, but as it is in &s;ubjection to the love of thee.</P>
<P>Here is the fir&s;t and great commandment, the unchangeable law, the <HI>law</HI> that was <HI>good</HI> in <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>' days, and good in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s days, and it holds good in our days; and indeed it is &s;uch a definitive law, that the breakers of it can neither be good <HI>Jews,</HI> nor good <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI> There is an ab&s;olute nece&s;|&s;ity lies upon us, of ab&s;tracting and drawing away our minds and &s;ouls from all other gods, from all images and other de|pendencies and tru&s;ts that people are naturally liable to tru&s;t to, and to have their whole confidence &s;et upon the Lord; but alas! with grief of heart I &s;peak it, there are but very few that as yet have known the right giving forth of the <HI>law,</HI> and there are fewer that are &s;ubject to it. This law was not
<PB N="25" REF="020309_0025_0FAEF6680AFC2A10">
given forth at fir&s;t without thunder and lightening, and a terrible noi&s;e, and the mountain &s;moking (he that hath an car to hear, let him hear) in&s;omuch as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> him&s;elf &s;aid, he feared greatly, and he quaked exceedingly, becau&s;e of the thunder of the Almighty, and the mountain that &s;moked and burnt with fire, &s;o that <HI>I&s;rael</HI> could not draw nigh.</P>
<P>Now I &s;ay, there are but a few that have come to the knowledge of the giving forth of this law, that have certainly known tho&s;e thunders, and that terrible work that the Lord of the whole earth makes, when he comes to &s;et up his law; for a great many that have come nigh to it, and might have heard and received the words of the law of God, they have gone backward, they have done like unto the Jews of old, though they had &s;uffered much, and gone through much, and had &s;een the wonders of the Lord; how he had led them and delivered them; yet when it came to this, that they mu&s;t hear the voice of God, they &s;aid we cannot bear it; we can|not endure it: We have devi&s;ed for our&s;elves an ea&s;ier way; for the voice of thunder and dreadful noi&s;es, put them into ter|ror and quaking, and trembling, and great dread came upon them; but we have found an ea&s;ier way, &s;ay they; what is that? <HI>Go thou,</HI> &s;aid they to <HI>Mo&s;es, and hear thou what the Lord &s;aith, and come thou and tell us,</HI> thou &s;halt be a Mediator between us; let God &s;peak unto thee, and do thou &s;peak the &s;ame to us, and we will hear thee.</P>
<P>Thus the Jews that were not come beyond the law of God written in <HI>tables of &s;tone,</HI> they would not come to receive it in their hearts, as the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> mu&s;t; &s;o <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> received the <HI>law</HI> from the <HI>mouth of God,</HI> and he was faithful as a &s;ervant in the hou&s;e of God, and he mini&s;tered forth the law of God, his precepts, &s;tatutes and judgments, and te&s;timonies; and he made them a book of laws for all of them to walk by, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t; how they &s;hould act in criminal matters, and to do ju&s;tice between man and man, and what they &s;hould do in the wor&s;hip of God, and what they &s;hould do towards the prie&s;t, who&s;e lips &s;hould pre&s;erve knowledge for them; and &s;o he brought up a form of religion; but his work was accor|ding to the precepts of God; and he brought them into the form of national religion, and government, and national laws. And &s;o <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the prie&s;t ruled over them; and
<PB N="26" REF="020309_0026_0FAEF668F66EC4C8">
the prie&s;t offered &s;acrifice for them, and made atonement for them, and <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> enquired of the Lord, and asked council for them, and taught and in&s;tructed them; and what became of all this at la&s;t? When this was done, the prie&s;t made atone|ment for &s;in, but he could not pluck away the guilt of one &s;in; <HI>there remained the con&s;cience of &s;in</HI> after he had made his of|fering; and <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> taught them the coun&s;els of God, and the commands of God, but he could not bind their hearts to the obedience of them; for he declared openly again&s;t them, that they were <HI>a rebellious and &s;tiff-necked people,</HI> notwith|&s;tanding they had a law without them. Indeed, time would fail me to run through the manifold mi&s;carriages of the church of the <HI>Jews,</HI> in re&s;pect of their idolatry, in re&s;pect of their contempt and rebellion, both to God and his &s;ervant <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> who was to teach and to guide them: I &s;ay, the time would fail me to mention the manifold mi&s;carriages that happened among this people, that had a law and religion with|out them, and a teacher without them.</P>
<P>Now in the fulne&s;s of time it plea&s;ed God in &s;ending his Son, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, to rai&s;e up a prophet like unto <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> in re&s;pect of faithfulne&s;s, though higher in re&s;pect of dignity; for <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was faithful in all his hou&s;e as a &s;ervant, but this man was faithful as a &s;on in his own hou&s;e, in the hou&s;e that he was heir of, that hou&s;e wherein he was as King, even a prie&s;t, a prophet, and a ruler in. When the Lord &s;ignified by the &s;pirit of prophecy, the coming of the <HI>Ju&s;t One,</HI> he &s;ignified to the people that his mini&s;try &s;hould not be as that of <HI>Aaron;</HI> the people &s;hould not have their religion without them, and their laws and precepts with|out them, and their prie&s;ts without them, and their wor|&s;hip and church without them; but that they &s;hould have it all within them. <HI>I will write my law in their hearts, I will put it into their inward parts, then they &s;hall be my people, and I will be their God, and they &s;hall not for&s;ake me.</HI> Your fathers brake my old covenant, but I will make a new cove|nant in the latter days, a new covenant, not like that your fathers broke; they brake the law without them, <HI>but I will write my law in their hearts; this prophet that is like to</HI> Mo|&s;es, <HI>he &s;hall teach my people, he &s;hall be a leader to them, and guide them in the way they are to go, and &s;hall be a captain for
<PB N="27" REF="020309_0027_0FAEF66A301DDF00">
them, to lead them to &s;alvation; and it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, in the day that I do this, if there be any that will not hear him, he &s;hall be cut off from among the people.</HI> That is, the judgment that comes upon the contemners of the go&s;pel, upon them that will not hear Chri&s;t Je&s;us, they &s;hall be cut off from the peo|ple; from what people? From the people of God; they &s;hall have no part of the privileges that are enjoyed thro' Chri&s;t; they &s;hall be cut off from the benefits that others reap by their faith in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>So that now we are to expect the operation and work|ing of a mini&s;try, that leads a people to an inward re|ligion, a heart religion, where the heart is fixed entirely upon the true and living God, as the object of their de|pendence and tru&s;t; and they have no other. This is a &s;trange word to fle&s;h and blood; what, no other depen|dence than on the invi&s;ible God? Fle&s;h and blood, and &s;en&s;uality, can never come to this; this is a religion that hath been hid from ages and generations, and will be hid to all ages that ever &s;hall be in the world, where &s;en&s;uality prevails. What, will you have me to have my whole depen|dence for the comfort of my life here, and of the life that is to come, the other life, to have my dependence upon an in|vi&s;ible God, that invi&s;ible power that made me, and cre|ated the world? How is it po&s;&s;ible for me to &s;eque&s;ter my&s;elf, and draw my&s;elf off from all vi&s;ible objects? I mu&s;t tru&s;t to this, and tru&s;t to that: Fle&s;h and blood can never attain to this, with all the wit and rea&s;on it hath; it can never &s;eparate it&s;elf from idols; they are little chil|dren; they are children of another birth, born of another &s;eed, that keep them&s;elves from idols.</P>
<P>Friends, idolatry is a great deal more common, I find, than mo&s;t are aware of. Am I commanded to <HI>love the Lord with all my heart, and &s;oul, and mind, and might?</HI> What is left when the whole is taken away? If God hath my whole heart, what have I to be&s;tow upon the world? What love, what affection, what eagerne&s;s, what fervency can I be&s;tow upon the world, or any object in the world, when my whole heart, and &s;oul, and mind, is gone be|fore, is gone toward the Lord?</P>
<P>This is the fir&s;t and great commandment; and the &s;e|cond
<PB N="28" REF="020309_0028_0FAEF66A4939B1C0">
is like unto it, that is, <HI>thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf.</HI> Here it is that the law and the prophets, &s;aith, creeds, prayer, religion and wor&s;hip, all that ever was in the world, all are comprehended in this, <HI>thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, &s;oul and &s;trength, and thy neighbour as thy&s;elf.</HI> So what need is there for us to be di&s;puting about religion; about this tenet, and the other tenet; this text, and the other text? For my part, I &s;hould only de&s;ire you to under&s;tand this text, and I &s;hould not doubt your going to Heaven. Here is the &s;um; here is all at once; here is the quinte&s;&s;ence of all religion, of all types, &s;hadows, figures, ceremonies and prie&s;t-hood, and all that ever was or could be named and practi&s;ed in the world; all brought to this, <HI>the heart giv|en up to God;</HI> our love &s;et upon him.</P>
<P>What, is this &s;ufficient, will &s;ome &s;ay? This will make you a good moral man; but what is this to the Chri&s;tian religion? You may be led into error, and become a he|retic for all this.</P>
<P>How can this be, that I &s;hould not be of a &s;ound faith, but led into error and here&s;y for all this? When people let in error, and here&s;y, and un&s;oundne&s;s of faith, where do they let it in? Do they not let in the principles of error and here&s;y into their hearts? I believe this, and that, and the other error, that it comes into the heart, and hath a &s;eat in the heart; but how can we let it into the heart, <HI>when the heart is given up to God?</HI> Cannot I keep out error and here&s;y, if I give up my heart and &s;oul to him? Cannot I tru&s;t him with all?</P>
<P>This kind of talk of error and here&s;y hath come among men that have had the keeping of their own &s;ouls: They have taken their own &s;ouls into their own hands, and have ordered their religion them&s;elves, or have had &s;ome|body to order it for them; and a great many of them have met together to make creeds, and catechi&s;ms, and confe&s;&s;ions, and orthodox doctrines, that might certainly be profe&s;&s;ed and &s;ub&s;cribed. So afterwards &s;ome have come and found fault with them; then they mu&s;t have a coun|cil to try them; then the&s;e go off and are laid a&s;ide, and others are given in the room of them; &s;o that the&s;e men
<PB N="29" REF="020309_0029_0FAEF66C8797E8A0">
have &s;et up for them&s;elves. The&s;e would not be under the government and pre&s;cription of God, as children un|der the government of a father; but they will &s;et up re|ligions them&s;elves, and &s;ay to the re&s;t of the world, if you own any thing contrary to our principles, you are a heretic; and being a heretic, you are to be rooted out and cut off. Do not you read in the &s;cripture, that <HI>whover hears not the Prophet that was to come into the world, &s;hould be cut off?</HI> What, will not you hear Chri&s;t &s;peak in the church? Will not you hear Chri&s;t &s;peak? The church cannot &s;peak without a head; if you will not hear the church, you mu&s;t be cut off. Then they have fallen to hanging, and burning, and killing, and de&s;troying people, and nations not a few: And this comes from their mak|ing faiths, and creeds, and ordering religion them&s;elves: All their barbarous and inhuman cruelties, martyring and dungeoning people, comes from their making faiths them|&s;elves; and of all things nothing is more de&s;perately wicked, and they did not know it. <HI>The heart is deceitful above all things, and de&s;perately wicked, who can know it?</HI> Men know not how proud and arrogant they them&s;elves are, and yet they would be ordering the hearts, and minds, and con|&s;ciences of others; and out of this hath &s;prung all &s;u|per&s;tition and idolatry, becau&s;e men would not give up their hearts to God; <HI>thou &s;halt have no other Gods but me.</HI> This commandment is great in it&s;elf; &s;trict in the terms; <HI>thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thy neighbour as thy&s;elf.</HI> Their neighbours could not &s;ee with their eyes; therefore they would be hanging, and burning, and de&s;troying one another.</P>
<P>But, ble&s;&s;ed be God, who is now bringing forth true Chri&s;|tianity upon its old ba&s;is and foundation, whereon it was placed at fir&s;t, for Chri&s;tianity hath been ju&s;tled off from its fir&s;t foundation; for in&s;tead of loving God with all their hearts, and loving their neighbours as them&s;elves, they hated them: Now this is the day, O friends! the weight of it is great; this I &s;ay is the day wherein God is bringing Chri&s;|tianity upon its old foundation.</P>
<P>I would not have you think that I am here judging our fore-fathers, that are fallen a&s;leep, that, therefore, they are
<PB N="30" REF="020309_0030_0FAEF66DAD5FFF50">
gone to Hell, becau&s;e they &s;aw not this day, and lived not to &s;ee that benefit of it that we enjoy; I am far from it: This was the thing that they believed and prayed to God for; they did not &s;ee this day outwardly, but they &s;aw it by faith. When I was a child, I remember the people of God, when they met three or four together, they would rejoice in the hopes of what they fore&s;aw; they gave thanks to God for the ble&s;&s;ed days that he would bring forth, though they could not tell when; they did &s;ay, and believe, that God would &s;catter the fogs, and mi&s;ts, and bring forth a happy day, wherein his people &s;hould have the gift of his Spirit: When they &s;aw the impo&s;itions and per&s;ecutions of tho&s;e times, when they that did not conform, and comply, were ca&s;t into pri&s;ons, dun|geons and gaols; well, it will not always be thus, &s;ay they, there is a day coming, wherein the Lord will &s;et his people free from all the yokes of oppre&s;&s;ion, and from the oppre&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>Indeed, my &s;oul did rejoice in hearing the prophetical &s;ayings of tho&s;e good men, and I thought I might live to &s;ee that day. Ble&s;&s;ed be God that hath pre&s;erved my life to this day, and to this hour, to enjoy what they prayed for: They prayed to God to &s;catter the mi&s;ts and fogs, that they might no longer cloud and darken men's minds, and hinder them from enjoying God's teaching. Ble&s;&s;ed be God, that we are now in the enjoyment of the prayers of the faithful, that left the world before we were in it. Now the day is come that they prayed for, and enquired after.</P>
<P>How &s;trangely doth the man talk, will &s;ome &s;ay, concern|ing the Chri&s;tian religion; the Chri&s;tian religion is all <HI>Eng|land over;</HI> go to any meeting in <HI>London,</HI> except one, and they will tell you they are Chri&s;tians; I would to God they were; that is the wor&s;t I wi&s;h them all. But what &s;hould we talk of the Chri&s;tian religion without the Chri&s;tian life? except we find that among&s;t them, what &s;ignifies the name and profe&s;&s;ion of it? And the Chri&s;tian doctrine is wanting in many places too. There is many in this city, urging this very command, of loving God with all their hearts, and their neighbours as them&s;elves, as fervently as I can do, or any body el&s;e; and yet they will tell you in the next breath, that no man in <HI>London,</HI> nor in the world, can do this; no man can po&s;&s;ibly love God with all his heart; never a man can be found that can

Chri&s;|tian words will not make the Chri&s;tian religion, there mu&s;t be a Chri&s;tian life; but where &s;hall we find that, or &s;eek it?</P>
<P>I know not, I have nothing to do to judge any body, but there is one that judgeth who it is that liveth the Chri&s;tian life, and who doth not? Who is this? what one is this? <HI>The HEAD of the Chri&s;tian church:</HI> Why, is he here? Yes, the head of the Chri&s;tian church is here, and he &s;peaks and gives &s;entence; if you have an ear you may hear him, and if you will turn your mind inward, for he is an <HI>inward mini&s;ter,</HI> every one of you, if you will turn your minds inward, he will tell you whether you live a Chri&s;tian life, and what <HI>life</HI> it is you <HI>live:</HI> If there be a drunkard here, let him ask whether his life be a Chri&s;tian life; will a man go away ignorant from this place, and have no an&s;wer? If there be a drunkard here, let him ask inwardly in his own bo&s;om, Lord is my life a Chri&s;tian <HI>life?</HI> I dare affirm, on God's behalf, he will have an an&s;wer, no, thy life is not a Chri&s;tian <HI>life,</HI> but a &s;hameful, bea&s;tly life, a bruti&s;h one.</P>
<P>Who told you that the <HI>Head</HI> of Chri&s;tians, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, is pre&s;ent? Chri&s;t Je&s;us, is he pre&s;ent? How came he here? He is a&s;cended up into Heaven &s;uch a day, &s;ay they, how came he here? Let him be a&s;cended up into Heaven, yet he is not &s;o a&s;cended into Heaven as not to be here al&s;o; how &s;hould he fulfil his promi&s;e, if he be circum&s;cribed in Heaven or earth?

<P>Can you read the &s;criptures? Yes, I can read the &s;criptures as well at you but that cannot give me a &s;en&s;e of it; I do read the &s;criptures and believe them; but what &s;ignifies my read|ing the &s;criptures concerning the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t, if I have not a &s;en&s;e of it? I have been at many a meeting, but never had the &s;en&s;e of &s;uch a Divine Pre&s;ence as you talk of, nor it may be at the &s;acrament neither: What is the rea&s;on thou ha&s;t no &s;en&s;e of it? If thou wilt take my coun&s;el, and turn thy mind inward, and enquire whether the thing I &s;peak of be true, whether there be &s;uch a voice as I &s;peak of, that will tell thee what thy &s;tate is: If thou wilt be true to thy|&s;elf, thou maye&s;t know the Divine Pre&s;ence, and thou maye&s;t hear Chri&s;t &s;peak.</P>
<P>The &s;oul hath eyes, and ears, as well as the body. What eyes doth the apo&s;tle mean when he &s;aith, <HI>the God of this world hath blinded the eyes of them that believe not, le&s;t the light of the glorious go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, who is the image of God, &s;hould &s;hine unto them?</HI> If the &s;oul hath eyes, and ears, as well as the body, it can hear, and &s;ee as the body; as the bodily eye can &s;ee vi&s;ible things, &s;o the eye of the &s;oul can &s;ee things that are invi&s;ible, and heavenly; you can hear my voice outwardly, and you may hear the voice of Chri&s;t in|wardly. I have known &s;ome that have been &s;o afraid to hear ill of them&s;elves, that they would not enquire; &s;ome have been &s;o guilty in their own con&s;ciences, that they have been afraid of hearing ill, and would not enquire about them|&s;elves: So it is inwardly; &s;ome have been &s;o con&s;cious that their life and conver&s;ation is naught, that their life is a &s;in|ful life, that they dare not put it to the que&s;tion: It would certainly have been told them, thy life is not a Chri&s;tian life; thou mu&s;t mend thy life, before ever thou come&s;t to have peace with God: If this &s;hould be thy portion and mine, that upon &s;earch we &s;hould find our condition bad, what harm is it?</P>
<P>I would put one que&s;tion to thee, be &s;erious in con&s;idering of it: We are all children of wrath by nature, none of us differ about that, and that <HI>unle&s;s we be born again, we cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</HI> The que&s;tion is, whether I

am one of tho&s;e or not? Suppo&s;e upon enquiry it be di&s;co|vered to me that I am not, that is bad enough; this is hard, but not &s;o hard as it is true; this is the thing which I would have you con&s;ider: Am not I in a better ca&s;e to know that I am in a natural &s;tate, than to go on and peri&s;h to eternity? As long as there is life, there is hope; as long as a man is up|on the earth, and taking care for his &s;oul, and enquiring about the &s;tate of his immortal &s;oul, if his &s;oul is not in a good con|dition, is it not better for him to know it, and to &s;eek for a cure? For there is no greater infirmity and infelicity can be upon man, than to have &s;ome occult and hidden di&s;ea&s;e, that he cannot be made &s;en&s;ible of; for this wa&s;tes and &s;poils him, and he cannot be per&s;uaded to look out for a remedy: So it is inwardly; if a man be ignorant of his condition, and go on to his dying day, and hour, and does not &s;eek after a re|medy, this men peri&s;heth without all peradventure. When you are in this enquiry, be content to be controlled, be willing to have the truth &s;poken, though it be again&s;t your&s;elves. I might in&s;tance in divers things that I have &s;poken of: If a man be &s;atisfied that his life is not a Chri&s;tian life; I &s;ay, if the &s;wearer or liar, if the proud per&s;on, or the effeminate, as &s;oon as they come to be &s;atisfied that their life is not a Chri&s;|tian life that they now live, what can this man expect? What coun&s;el &s;hould we give him, and what coun&s;el &s;hould he take? I will go on in the way that I am in: What, after thou know|e&s;t thy life is not a Chri&s;tian life? God forbid: Wilt thou go on and perpetrate &s;in upon &s;in, and heap up wrath again&s;t the day of wrath; I am a &s;inner, my life is unchri&s;tian, I make account to live in &s;in, and die in &s;in; is this good policy?

<P>O friends, lay the&s;e things to your hearts; what have I to do but to tell you that the love I have in my &s;oul for you all, makes me de&s;ire in my heart that you might be &s;aved? <HI>This is the will of God, that you might all be &s;aved, and come to the knowledge of the truth: Ble&s;&s;ed are they that know the truth; the truth as it is in Je&s;us.</HI> Truth in the inward parts, hath a &s;peaking voice; and if thou hearken to it, it will tell thee that thy &s;tate is naught.

thy &s;tate is naught, and that thou art like to go to eter|nal de&s;truction, unle&s;s there be repentance and regeneration to prevent it? Can&s;t thou believe this doctrine, when it &s;ounds in thy own heart? If thou can&s;t not believe it, unbelief will be thy ruin. <HI>The &s;pirit of truth is come to convince the world of &s;in, becau&s;e they believe not in Chri&s;t:</HI> He tells them their condition, and they will not believe him.

Art thou &s;en|&s;ible that thy condition is bad, were it not be&s;t to get it mended? After we are convinced of our own &s;inful &s;tate, is it not our be&s;t, cour&s;e to &s;eek to have it mend|ed? Who &s;hall mend it? &s;aith one; I have done all I can to mend my life, and I cannot mend it.</P>
<P>I have concluded &s;o in my younger years; I have fa&s;ted, and prayed, and &s;pent time in hearing, reading, and me|ditation, and did all in my own power, and all to mend my &s;tate, but I could not mend it; and as I grew up in years, &s;in and corruption more prevailed, and there was no help; and I came &s;o far as to believe there was no help, and that if God did not help me, I was undone to all eternity. I many times wi&s;hed that I had never been born: I went to mini&s;ters and meetings, and to all &s;orts of &s;eparate people, and to all manner of ordinances, and to all manner of means, to mend this bad heart of mine, to &s;ee if I could get a power that would give me vic|tory over my corruptions; but my arm was never &s;o long as to reach thereunto; it was far out of my power and reach.</P>
<P>Many have &s;ought to get this power of reforming their hearts and lives; to attain it by their own hands, by their own endeavours, but they could never do it; they could never better their condition, nor bring forth fruit worthy of amendment of life. I wi&s;h that every one was come to that pa&s;s, that they knew not which way to turn them; that they were come at la&s;t to their wits end: They
<PB N="35" REF="020309_0035_0FAEF671CEA58300">
will come to it &s;ooner or later; the &s;ooner the better. I have done all I can; I can do no more; I am at my wits end, and I know not what to think, concerning my eter|nal &s;tate; I know not what to judge of it; I &s;trive again&s;t my lu&s;ts and corruptions, but for all that they prevail again&s;t me: Temptations come before me, but I cannot conquer them. O I am glad when people come to that pa&s;s, that they know not what to do, but de&s;pair of their own arms, of their own &s;trength, and their own wit, and de&s;pair of all other help in the world; I am glad of that.</P>
<P>I am not preaching up de&s;pair of God's grace and mercy; but let me tell you, when men de&s;pair of their own do|ings, and of all outward means, and helps, then they are fit objects for the mercy of God; and not till then: <HI>When the Lord looked, and &s;aw that there was none to &s;ave and deliver, then his own arm brought &s;alvation.</HI> God will not &s;ave till then; God will not reveal his power, till men have done with their own power; they will never tru&s;t God, while they think they can do &s;omething for them&s;elves. All the forms of religion of the &s;everal peo|ple of this nation, will do them little good without the power. What is the meaning of that principle, to have &s;uch ma&s;&s;es, and prayers, and performances? What is the meaning of it? Let us &s;earch to the bottom. They &s;ay we are &s;inners; when we pray to God for his ble&s;&s;ing, and for &s;alvation by Chri&s;t, there is this at the bottom, they think the&s;e duties and performances will be very help|ful to their &s;tate; helpful towards the knowledge of it: To &s;peak plain Engli&s;h, the&s;e are their Gods. If I &s;peak of prophane and wicked people, I would &s;ay their lu&s;ts are their Gods: But when I &s;peak of righteous people, that are meer formali&s;ts, then I &s;ay their duties, as they call them, are their Gods. When they have done all, they can do nothing for them, and then they have no Gods at all; then they are <HI>godle&s;s:</HI> And if God doth not help them, then they are undone to all eternity.</P>

their hypocri&s;y is &s;o great.

He &s;tands as the door and knocks; it is a &s;mall matter, one would think, to let him in: <HI>Rev.</HI> iii, 20. <HI>Behold, I &s;tand at the door and knock; and if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and &s;up with him, and he with me.</HI> Here is good news for an hun|gry &s;oul, if any &s;uch be here; Chri&s;t the Mediator, &s;tands at the door and knocks, he will come in and &s;up with thee, if thou open to him; then we &s;hall meet with the Lord's &s;upper: <HI>This is the Lord, I will wait for him;</HI> he will bring his bread with him, the bread of life, and the wine of his kingdom, and the Lord's &s;upper will be celebrated without cavilling and jangling.</P>
<P>Now, becau&s;e we will not pervert the &s;cripture, I would have you that under&s;tand books, read what <HI>commentators</HI> of this and former ages &s;ay upon this text; whether they do not deliver in their opinions, that this knocking at the door, is Chri&s;t calling the &s;oul by his grace; and this door is the door of the heart, and Chri&s;t's calling the &s;oul by his grace and Spirit, to let him in by faith: This is their judgment and &s;en&s;e, and their &s;en&s;e is mine; and I believe the genuine &s;en&s;e of this text, that Chri&s;t would have people think he is near to them, and would have them open their hearts, and receive him by faith, to be a Saviour to them.</P>
<P>No; that, &s;aith fle&s;h and blood, I cannot bear, I cannot con&s;ent to have him for my Saviour, I will not let him in, for he is like <HI>Micaiah</HI> to <HI>Ahab, he never &s;pake good concerning me:</HI> For if I have him for my Saviour, I mu&s;t part with my lu&s;ts and plea&s;ures; if there be any other Saviour, I will try, and not meddle with him; he will &s;poil all our mirth and

good &s;ociety; he will tell me that every idle word that I &s;hall &s;peak, I mu&s;t give an account thereof in the day of judg|ment: What, do you think that I can like &s;uch a Saviour? That I can live with &s;uch a one as will call me to an account for every word I &s;peak; and that if I &s;peak one idle word, judgment will come upon me? No, I will try one and ano|ther, rather than accept of him on &s;uch terms; I am one that am joined to &s;uch a church, and enjoy &s;uch and &s;uch ordi|nances, and &s;uch helps: I am in covenant with God, and under the &s;eals of that covenant; I am baptized, and do par|take of the Lord's &s;upper, which is another &s;eal of the cove|nant; I hope it will go well with me. I will go &s;omething farther: Another &s;aith, he mu&s;t have a Mediator; I will go to the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> and offer &s;omething to her, and pray to her: Saith another, I will go to Saint <HI>James,</HI> and Saint <HI>John,</HI> and other Saints to intercede with God for me. They mu&s;t have &s;ome Mediator: This is the twi&s;ting and twining of the &s;ons and daughters of men, to keep out Chri&s;t, the great Mediator, who came into the world for this purpo&s;e, to de&s;troy the works of the Devil. Alas! I have nothing left but my bare life and living in this world; I have nothing left me but &s;ome <HI>little de&s;ire I had to plea&s;e God,</HI> and that he will never judge and condemn me for; but my fal&s;e dealing, and buying and &s;elling with deceit, he will judge this, and condemn me; and my di&s;cour&s;ing of things without me; all my carnal friend&s;hip of the world, and my vain fa&s;hions, all this is corrupt and defiled; the&s;e he came on purpo&s;e to de|&s;troy; he came to de&s;troy both the Devil and his works. What, can a man live in the world, and never join with the Devil? never &s;in at all? never do any thing that the Devil would have him to do? There is no perfection in this world; no living without &s;in here; then I am &s;ure there is no unity with Chri&s;t here; and if there be no unity with Chri&s;t, then there is none with God the Father. What will become of thee now? What will all the pleaders for that opinion &s;ay now? There is &s;omething &s;tands between God and me, and I &s;hall never have peace; and what is that? It is &s;in; I would have my &s;in taken away, el&s;e I had better ne|ver been born. Can&s;t thou remove &s;in out of thy heart? I have tried, but I cannot do it; I have heard of Chri&s;t the
<PB N="39" REF="020309_0039_0FAEF6758B00E118">
<HI>Mediator</HI> of the new covenant, he &s;aith, he came into the world, and that for this purpo&s;e he was manife&s;ted, that he might de&s;troy the works of the Devil. Now &s;in in my heart is the Devil's work, I will &s;ee if he will de&s;troy that for me; I will tru&s;t and rely upon him, and &s;ee if his great power can de&s;troy it in me.</P>
<P>Here people come rightly to believe in him that God hath &s;ent, and tru&s;t in him, and he will take them in; and, like a Chirurgeon, he will rip their hearts, and let out their corruptions, though there hath been ever &s;o much rottenne&s;s; and he will heal them, and purify them, and pardon them, though they have been ever &s;o wicked, if they come to him; when thy &s;ins are &s;et in order before thee, then thou crie&s;t out, <HI>O wretched man that I am! who &s;hall deliver me from this body of death?</HI> Is it God that hath thought on me, and waited to be gracious, hath born my &s;ins long? how won|derful is his patience towards me! All the&s;e things working in the &s;oul, tends to beget a love of God, and fervent de&s;ires after being clean&s;ed and purified from &s;in, and earne&s;t prayer to the Lord, to make the holy fire to kindle that would burn it up: The more the &s;oul tru&s;teth in Chri&s;t, the more doth this heavenly fire burn up our lu&s;ts, and then a man feels a great change in his mind: The things, &s;aith he, that I delight|ed in, are now grievous to me; I hope I &s;hall never be found in tho&s;e things again; my mind is now taken off them; who took it off? Did&s;t thou not &s;trive before to take it off? I did, but I could not do it. There are many, I believe, in this a&s;&s;embly, before the Lord, that are my witne&s;&s;es in this matter, that when they came to Chri&s;t the Mediator, he changed their minds, and he untied the Devil's fetters; they were tied to their &s;ins and lu&s;ts, but he hath unloo&s;ed them; they are a&s;hamed of tho&s;e things that they formerly took plea&s;ure in. <HI>What fruit</HI> (&s;aith the apo&s;tle) <HI>had you in tho&s;e things, whereof you are now a&s;hamed?</HI> So I &s;ay, what plea|&s;ure have you in &s;porting, and gaming, and drinking, and company-keeping? What plea&s;ure have you to think on your wanton di&s;cour&s;es? What plea&s;ure in pride and vanity? What plea&s;ure in wrath and bitterne&s;s of mind? And what plea&s;ure in malice and envy? What plea&s;ure have you in the&s;e things whereof you are now a&s;hamed? So far as you
<PB N="40" REF="020309_0040_0FAEF6776D7223D8">
are convinced, you are a&s;hamed to think of them; I am a&s;hamed to think that the Devil at &s;uch a time, by &s;uch a temptation, &s;hould prevail over me.</P>
<P>I would to God you were all come to this, to be a&s;hamed that you might remember your pa&s;t evil ways and actions, with &s;orrow and &s;hame: There is a &s;ecret joy in this. Sure it is better to be a&s;hamed, than to con|tinue in impudence. God hath wrought this change at la&s;t; and who &s;hall have the glory of it? God &s;hall have the glory of it; for his own works will prai&s;e him. What men do, many times they do for their own prai&s;e; but when they are at their wits end, and know not what to do, they ca&s;t them&s;elves upon their Maker, to &s;ee if he will have mercy upon them; if not, they mu&s;t peri&s;h: Then for what he doth, he gets the glory and the prai&s;e of it.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome here, that are bound to prai&s;e God while they have a day to live, for what he hath done for them. They could never have loved God with all their hearts; but they would have continued &s;trangers to God, and the Devil would have led them captive at his will. They would not have loved God with all their hearts, had not God fir&s;t <HI>&s;hed abroad his love upon their hearts,</HI> and con&s;trained them to love him: It is he that hath fir&s;t loved them, and <HI>wrought in them, both to will and to do, of his own good plea&s;ure.</HI> What&s;oever we are, we are by the grace of God; this grace is magnified in them that believe and obey the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>My friends, we know there is &s;o much peace and plea|&s;ure in the ways of God; &s;o much &s;oul-&s;atisfaction in walking with God, and loving of him with all our hearts, I &s;hould be glad if every one of you were of the &s;ame mind, and had experience of it. We labour diligently for this purpo&s;e; and we would &s;et before you the&s;e two things:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, how we may come to know our mi&s;erable &s;tand by nature.</P>
<P>And what a ble&s;&s;ed and happy &s;tate they are in, that have been converted and changed; that have been tran&s;lated out of the kingdom of darkne&s;s, into the kingdom of God's dear Son.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="020309_0041_0FAEF679068D71C8">Con&s;ider your &s;tate by nature is evil; we hope that many of you believe the report's of the go&s;pel, concerning the good|ne&s;s of the Lord, his great love in &s;ending his Son into the world, to &s;eek and to &s;ave you that were lo&s;t, and that you believe in him. And we are per&s;uaded, that by the fooli&s;h|ne&s;s of preaching God will &s;ave &s;ome of you, that you may be his redeemed ones, and tru&s;t to no other Saviour: <HI>For there is not any other name under Heaven, but the name of Je&s;us, by which we can be &s;aved.</HI> He only can take away the &s;ins of the world; his &s;pirit &s;earcheth the heart, and trieth the reins, which he promi&s;ed to &s;end into the world when he was about leaving of it. Now I dare pro|claim that Holy Spirit to be the Spirit of the God of Heaven, that now &s;ees what re&s;olution thou art of, and what thou art now propo&s;ing to do; whether to go on in &s;in, or to return to God. This I can &s;peak without bla&s;phemy, it is God's Spirit that &s;earcheth the heart, and knoweth thy thoughts and purpo&s;es, and convinceth thee of thy &s;in: God hath &s;ent his Son Chri&s;t Je&s;us into the world to enlighten you, that by his light you may &s;ee him; and that by his grace you might receive him; and that by his grace you might be &s;aved.</P>
<P>To him I commit you all, and the&s;e words that we have &s;poken in the evidence and demon&s;tration of the &s;pi|rit, according as he hath wrought in us.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t tell you we were never called of God to &s;tudy <HI>Sermons</HI> for you, nor to preach things that are made ready to our hands; but as the <HI>Lord our God</HI> hath wrought in us, and as God hath been plea&s;ed to make known his mind to us, and by his Spirit given us utterance, &s;o we &s;peak, and &s;o we preach. You that are come to believe and re|ceive the things of the Spirit, you will judge what I &s;ay. <HI>I &s;peak unto you that are &s;piritual; judge ye what I &s;ay,</HI> &s;aith the apo&s;tle. So when I &s;peak of divine and hea|venly things, you that are &s;piritual, judge what I &s;ay? And as you come to judge and determine in your&s;elves that the&s;e things are true, you will feel the power of them in your own &s;pirits, and we &s;hall all be of the &s;ame mind; and as we have <HI>one God,</HI> we &s;hall &s;erve him in &s;incerity, and wor&s;hip him with reverence. Then his name
<PB N="42" REF="020309_0042_0FAEF67A29AFD830">
&s;hall be exalted in the mid&s;t of us, and we &s;hall edify one another in <HI>love,</HI> and we &s;hall in&s;truct one another, and call upon one another; <HI>come, let us go to the hou&s;e of the God of</HI> Jacob, <HI>he will teach us, and pre&s;erve us</HI> in his way, and do us good, and keep us from all evil.</P>
<P>Turn your minds inward, and con&s;ider that God is a God at hand, ready to help you; and he requires no more of you than of other people in former times, to love the Lord with all your hearts, and to ab&s;tract and withdraw your mind from all other things that do come in com|petition with him; and be &s;ure to have no tru&s;t or de|pendence but upon him; then &s;ee what God will do for you: No tongue can expre&s;s, nor pen write; <HI>nei|ther hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive, the things that God hath prepared for tho&s;e that love him.</HI> That wi&s;dom and knowledge, that joy and peace, and con&s;ola|tion, that pa&s;&s;eth all under&s;tanding, he will reveal and com|municate by his &s;pirit to them that love him, and tru&s;t in him, and rely upon him, and receive teaching from him; he will feed them <HI>with food in due &s;ea&s;on; he will bring the former and the latter rain, and they &s;hall be as trees planted by the rivers of water, and bring forth fruit in due &s;ea&s;on; and their leaf &s;hall not fade or wither.</HI></P>
<P>This hath been <HI>London</HI>'s wonder, and <HI>England</HI>'s won|der, how it comes to pa&s;s, that &s;uch a people's leaf hath not withered, nor faded, as many have done: Our root was by a river; if we had &s;tood in our&s;elves; if our dependence and &s;upport had been upon doctrines, tenets, and commandments of men, then our leaf would have been upon the ground as well as others; but becau&s;e we have been upon our root, <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> that is always green, both in &s;ummer and winter, therefore our leaf hath not withered; to the prai&s;e of God, and to the honour of his name, be it &s;poken: He hath pre&s;erved us, for we have no power of our&s;elves, no more than others; but we tru&s;t in God, and have received power from God, to &s;tand as witne&s;&s;es for him; we have tru&s;ted in the Lord, and he hath &s;tood by us, and delivered us, when we were compa&s;&s;ed about with dangers and di&s;tre&s;&s;es; if we con|tinue to tru&s;t in him &s;till, he will bring us through all

our trials and troubles, and he will be with us, and <HI>ne|ver leave us nor for&s;ake us;</HI> if we take him for our God, we &s;hall never need any other.</P>
<P>We read that <HI>Senacherib,</HI> king of <HI>A&s;&s;yria,</HI> &s;ent <HI>Rab&s;hekah</HI> to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> with a great army, &s;aying, <HI>what confidence is this wherein thou tru&s;te&s;t? And he &s;pake al&s;o to the people, and cried with a loud voice, hear you the word of the great king of</HI> A&s;&s;yria; <HI>let not</HI> Hezekiah <HI>deceive you, for he &s;hall not be able to deliver you; neither let</HI> Hezekiah <HI>make you tru&s;t in the Lord, &s;aying, the Lord will deliver us.</HI> Hezekiah <HI>went and prayed to the Lord, &s;aying, O Lord of ho&s;ts, God of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>that dwelle&s;t between the Cherubims, thou art the God, the God alone of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou ha&s;t made Heaven and earth; incline thine ear, O Lord, and hear; open thine eyes, O Lord, and &s;ee and hear all the words of</HI> Senache|rib, <HI>which he hath &s;ent to reproach the living God,</HI> &amp;c. And we read, that after he had pre&s;ented his &s;upplication be|fore the Lord, <HI>the angel of the Lord went forth and &s;mote in the camp of the</HI> A&s;&s;yrians, <HI>one hundred four &s;core and five thou|&s;and; and when they aro&s;e early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corps.</HI></P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee what came of it at la&s;t; and thus it hath been in our day; they that tru&s;t in the Lord, he will deliver them, and they &s;hall never be a&s;hamed nor confounded; but as for all other Gods, they that tru&s;t in them, &s;hall be confounded and covered with &s;hame, and they and their Gods will peri&s;h to|gether.</P>
<P>And now, my friends, I be&s;eech you all to have re&s;pect to this great duty of putting your whole tru&s;t in the <HI>Lord,</HI> who is the living <HI>God,</HI> and he will be always pre&s;ent with you, and work in you both to will and to do of his good plea&s;ure; he will &s;upport and pre&s;erve you in all your trials and &s;ufferings, that you may be ve&s;&s;els of honor, to bear his name in the earth, and &s;o &s;ound forth his prai&s;e to the following generations.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON IV. <HI>The</HI> STANDARD <HI>of</HI> TRUTH.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Preached at GRACE-CHURCH-STREET, <DATE>May <HI>29, 1692.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>THERE is a univer&s;al &s;tandard of truth, that God hath &s;et up over all the &s;ons and daughters of men; he hath given the knowledge of it in, and through Je&s;us Chri&s;t; he hath dealt it out to them, that they may be capable of joining and adhering to the truth, and to be delivered from eternal condemnation. This <HI>&s;tandard and mea&s;uring-rule</HI> is revealed and manife&s;ted in every man and woman, by the light that &s;hines in their hearts, by which they are able to di&s;cern, and to give a &s;ound and true judgment, (if they are but willing) upon all <HI>their own ways.</HI> A man or woman may know in every word they &s;peak, in every ac|tion they do, whether they &s;peak, and do, according to the truth, or whether they are ju&s;tified by the truth, in what they &s;peak and do.</P>
<P>I tell you, my friends, this is no &s;mall mercy, that man|kind hath obtained at the hand of his Maker, that he is brought into a capacity of not acting blind-fold, but that he may &s;ee his way, and his own inclinations, and pa&s;s judg|ment upon them, whether they are good or evil? Whether they will &s;tand ju&s;tified in the &s;ight of his Maker, or whether they will be condemned.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, the veil of ignorance, that is come over the &s;ons and daughters of men, through &s;in, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and rebellion, is very great. And I may &s;ay, as the apo&s;tle &s;aid, <HI>&s;ometime you were darkne&s;s:</HI> And what can darkne&s;s &s;ee? what can dark|ne&s;s di&s;cover? The Lord our God, that made us, hath not left us in that &s;tate of darkne&s;s, blindne&s;s and ignorance; but through the riches of his mercy and goodne&s;s, hath found out a way, to <HI>command that light &s;hould &s;hine out of darkne&s;s,</HI> into people's hearts, for all that the Devil did to darken man, to alienate and e&s;trange him from his Maker.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Almighty Power, that &s;aid in the creation, <HI>let there be light, and it was &s;o;</HI> he hath &s;hined into our hearts;
<PB N="46" REF="020309_0046_0FAEF67D6AD7A6C0">
and the way by which he hath done &s;o, is through the Media|tor, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Redeemer, <HI>in whom the fulne&s;s of the God-Head dwells.</HI> He hath received power from his Father, not only to by a light and &s;alvation, but to impart and communicate of that divine light unto them, even <HI>unto every one that cometh into the world;</HI> that &s;o by means thereof, they may be delivered from their darkne&s;s, and ignorance of the mind of God, that they were liable to in the fall, and might be re&s;tored, through the Mediator, to a capacity of judging of their own actions, and of their own words, and ways, and inclinations.</P>
<P>This is the <HI>&s;tandard</HI> which God hath pitched in every one of our bo&s;oms, for the trial of our&s;elves, either for our ju&s;ti|fication, or condemnation, of every word and action.</P>
<P>Now, to make every one &s;en&s;ible of the greatne&s;s of this ble&s;&s;ing, con&s;ider, it is not only given to augment and encrea&s;e knowledge, but it is given on purpo&s;e to allure and per&s;uade men into a liking of truth, into a love of truth: The apo&s;tle e&s;teemed it a wonderful mercy that came by Chri&s;t; <HI>he hath &s;ent him to ble&s;s us, in turning every one of us from the evil of his ways:</HI> So that here is a capacity that the &s;ons and daughters of men have, through the Mediator, of being turned from the evil of their ways and doings, to that which is well-plea&s;ing to God.</P>
<P>The next work, after God hath wrought thus mercifully for the &s;ons and daughters of men, is, that they would be good to them&s;elves, and merciful to them&s;elves, and take pity of them|&s;elves, by a due improvement of the grace, and mercy, and kindne&s;s of God, that he hath be&s;towed freely upon them; and in bringing all their deeds to that &s;tandard, all their words and actions to that rule; that &s;o what&s;oever they may be, or how many &s;oever, if they do not an&s;wer that &s;tandard and rule, they may deny, with&s;tand and re&s;i&s;t them, that &s;o they may keep out of condemnation: For the apo&s;tle declares it plainly without &s;cruple, <HI>there is no condemnation to them that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us:</HI> If he had &s;aid to them that profe&s;s Chri&s;t Je&s;us, there had been a large latitude, e&s;pecially for tho&s;e na|tions; but the words are limited, and you will find them &s;o; that is, <HI>to them that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us;</HI> and (as if he &s;hould &s;ay) that you may know rightly what I mean; I mean, <HI>&s;uch
<PB N="47" REF="020309_0047_0FAEF67DE39AE228">
as walk not after the fle&s;h, but after the &s;pirit.</HI> They that are in Chri&s;t, walk after his Spirit; for, <HI>they that walk not after the Spirit of Chri&s;t, are none of his;</HI> but they that are his, walk after the &s;pirit the &s;pirit of truth, and there is no con|demnation to them.</P>
<P>It is not only the &s;criptures that ratify and confirm this doctrine, but you your&s;elves are all living witne&s;&s;es of the truth of this, that &s;o far as you do act and &s;peak in obedience to the principle of truth, that God hath planted in you, you feel no condemnation upon you: Such a thing I did at &s;uch a time, and I had no condemnation: Why &s;o? becau&s;e I did it in obedience, and &s;ubjection to that mea&s;ure of grace that God &s;et up in me; and &s;uch a thing I did, for which I was condemned: Why &s;o? becau&s;e I did it according to the inclinations of my own corrupt mind, and in contradiction to the truth that opened in me.</P>
<P>My friends, I would have you in point of the doc|trine of chri&s;tianity, to be the better for what you read and hear: It is po&s;&s;ible for me to preach the truth, and you may believe what I &s;ay, and you may read the Ho|ly Scriptures, and have the belief of what you read; but if you come to a &s;en&s;ible feeling of the fulfilling of things you hear, you will give a greater &s;eal to the truth of the doctrine, than by all you have read and heard; and you will <HI>grow wi&s;e to &s;alvation,</HI> by trying and experiencing the effect of every thing you under&s;tand; and not like the carnal men of this world, that have not faith, that mind only their worldly profits and plea&s;ures, &s;uch are <HI>earth|ly, &s;en&s;ual and devili&s;h;</HI> but I would judge of actions and words, according to truth, and according to the effect I find in me. I did &s;uch a thing, and I had peace in the doing of it; I feel no reproach, no condemnation upon me. Here is a way for people to grow up in the life of chri&s;tianity; to keep to the &s;tandard of truth; for whe|ther men will or no, they mu&s;t do it at la&s;t, and may now, if they plea&s;e, make a trial of their words and ac|tions.</P>
<P>As for the mo&s;t part of you, you are got pa&s;t <HI>Pilate: Pilate</HI> could make that enquiry; <HI>what is truth?</HI> &s;aith he: And I confe&s;s, it is not long ago, it is within the me|mory
<PB N="48" REF="020309_0048_0FAEF67F1772DA78">
of man, that a more &s;erious and better &s;ort of peo|ple were &s;o confounded with the darkne&s;s and ignorance of tho&s;e times, that they were ready to cry out, what is truth? and where is truth? Their eyes were &s;o blinded, and things were &s;o jumbled and confu&s;ed by the di&s;pu|tations that men rai&s;ed, that made things &s;o dark people could not &s;ee their way: But <HI>God who hath commanded the light to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s,</HI> hath brought a <HI>glorious day;</HI> hath di&s;&s;ipated, and &s;cattered, and driven away a great deal of that fog and mi&s;t, that did over&s;pread men's minds. As many as have &s;incerely &s;ought the truth in the inward parts, they have found a divine principle of truth, that hath a &s;elf-evidencing quality in it&s;elf, to convince the minds and con&s;ciences of the &s;ons and daughters of men, that it is the truth: And to this the Lord hath brought mo&s;t of you, to be &s;en&s;ible of &s;omething that is truth in it&s;elf. There are many things that are true in the words of them; many true expre&s;&s;ions; but there is truth in it|&s;elf, the e&s;&s;ential truth of God, which, as it is in God, is everla&s;ting and eternal, and will &s;tand over all error, and fal&s;hood, and deceit: The truth, as it is in Chri&s;t Je|&s;us, is a &s;tandard and rule for men to act by; he hath given it to the &s;ons and daughters of men; and as it ap|pears in them, it is either a Judge to condemn them, or a Saviour to &s;ave them from their &s;ins, and to ju&s;tify them.</P>
<P>Now, that which concerns us, is to find out the mea&s;ure of truth, or manife&s;tation, or principle of truth, which it hath plea&s;ed God to reveal in our&s;elves: And who&s;oever will turn their minds a little while inward, into the &s;erious &s;earch and con&s;ideration, how the Lord hath dealt with them, they will find they are not quite de&s;titute of truth. One that makes it his practice to lye, cheat and cozen, is not utterly de&s;titute of truth; for there is a principle of truth in him, that doth check and reprove him for his theft, lying and fal&s;hood, and he lives under condemnation him&s;elf. He cannot draw near to the God of truth upon any occa&s;ion, but his lying and fal&s;hood &s;tand in his way. Now, if &s;o be, that this liar be made &s;en&s;ible of a principle of truth in him, and do but bring his words and actions to the truth, &s;o much of it as he
<PB N="49" REF="020309_0049_0FAEF67F4E829980">
knows will make him leave lying and deceiving, and to practi&s;e truth to e&s;cape condemnation; if he will but leave lying and fal&s;hood, and live in the truth, and &s;peak the truth to his neighbour, he will find another &s;tate, condition and frame in his &s;oul, than there was before: He is now more at peace, And hath a clear and &s;erene way, to come to God by prayer, and for pouring out his &s;upplication, which he had not be|fore; for he had barred up his own way by his &s;in, which lay continually at his door; <HI>if thou do&s;t not well, &s;in lies at thy door,</HI> &s;aith God to <HI>Cain:</HI> So, when you do evil, you cannot but know it; when you are drunk, or &s;wear or tell a lie, and deceive your neighbour, and carry on the de&s;ign of &s;inful profit, thou knowe&s;t it, whether men know it or no, and God that made thee knoweth it; and there thy &s;in lies at the door, and blocks and bars thee out, that thou can&s;t not offer thy prayers to God with that clearne&s;s, as if thou had&s;t &s;poken the truth: So that it highly concerns every one of us, to be waiting upon God, for the di&s;covery of his truth to us; and then we mu&s;t embrace, adhere and join to the truth, as our chiefe&s;t good.</P>
<P>But &s;ome will &s;ay, this adhering and joining to the truth, is a hard le&s;&s;on: It is pretty ea&s;y to find out a principle of truth, that &s;tandeth again&s;t, and oppo&s;eth all manner of evil: Very few, now a-days, will deny a &s;ettled principle of truth in all men, that judgeth fal&s;hood, and condemneth deceit, and witne&s;&s;eth again&s;t it in others, and in them&s;elves: But this &s;ame joining, and adhering to it, that cannot be done, with|out a cro&s;s to a carnal mind.</P>
<P>Now, if the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t be not taken up, there is no good Chri&s;tianity among us; where this is neglected, it &s;pots and &s;tains the profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, becau&s;e it is &s;o di|rectly oppo&s;ite to the doctrine of Chri&s;t; <HI>he that will be my di&s;ciple, mu&s;t;</HI> it is not, he may if he will; but, <HI>he mu&s;t take up the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, and follow</HI> HIM. There were a &s;ort of people, that were never like to be made Chri&s;tians, that would be exempt from taking up a daily cro&s;s; therefore he pre&s;&s;eth it upon them to deny them&s;elves, and take up his cro&s;s and follow him. No man is like to live a Chri&s;tian life, without taking up a daily cro&s;s.</P>
<P>This I cannot do, &s;ays one; I know how to carry my&s;elf

among Chri&s;tians with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, &s;obriety and watchfulne&s;s, without &s;haming any profe&s;&s;ion; but I cannot deny my&s;elf, I cannot contradict my own will: This is that which keeps a man from leading a Chri&s;tian life, when he cannot deny him&s;elf, and take up his daily cro&s;s.</P>
<P>Now, it is come to this now a-days, when a light is broken forth, and men have a principle of truth in their own hearts, it comes to this; &s;aith one, I ought to be <HI>holy in all manner of conver&s;ation,</HI> and to be watchful over my words, and have my conver&s;ation hone&s;t and ju&s;t without deceit: See what a deal I know, yet I can never live this life, for all I know it &s;o well; I cannot take up a daily cro&s;s, which is &s;o much again&s;t the contrary inclinations working in me; then the que&s;tion I put to my&s;elf is, &s;hall I take up a cro&s;s or no?</P>
<P>Here it comes to the point with every man&punc; or woman, after they come to the knowledge of this <HI>&s;tandard</HI> of truth: If the world would but come to this rule and &s;tandard, there would be no more cheating nor cozening, no more fraud, deceit nor di&s;&s;imulation, nor war and blood&s;hed; but if men would, in every thing they doy an&s;wer the principle of truth in them&s;elves, they would put the que&s;tion to them|&s;elves, &s;hall I take up my daily cro&s;s, or no? Shall I deny my&s;elf tho&s;e plea&s;ures that my con&s;cience doth condemn; and tho&s;e ungodly gains that I &s;eek after by fal&s;hood, by ly|ing, prevaricating and departing from the truth? Shall I do this, that I may be rich and great in the world, or &s;hall I not?</P>
<P>You know what I &s;ay, many of you, and have put this que&s;tion to your&s;elves, and &s;ome have made a good an&s;wer to it: I will take up my daily cro&s;s, by the grace of God; this &s;tandard of truth &s;hall be the rule of my words and actions, to my dying-day.</P>
<P>They that have learned this le&s;&s;on, and obtained peace with God, through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that have not only made a re&s;olution, but performed it in act and deed, by the power of Chri&s;t's cro&s;s, they are purified, and &s;anctified, and wa&s;h|ed from their old conver&s;ations, and <HI>have their conver&s;ation in Heaven;</HI> that is, live after a heavenly manner, live a godly life here upon earth, when they have come to this re&s;olution, and al&s;o the practice of it.</P>
<P>I would de&s;ire, and it is my labour, that you that hear me

this day, who are aware of what I am &s;peaking, <HI>viz. The STANDARD of TRUTH,</HI> the principle of Truth, that unerring Guide, which is placed in the con&s;cience of every man, and ju&s;tifieth, or condemneth, his actions and words. You who are come to be aware of this, that you may all come to this godly re&s;olution in your&s;elves, I would have this di&s;pute carried on in every one's bo&s;om. When the que&s;tion is &s;tated, I would have you really an&s;wer it; &s;hall I guide my actions and words according to this unerring rule, or no? I cannot tell what to &s;ay, &s;ay &s;ome, there is danger in it: What danger can there be to an&s;wer that which a man knows to be truth? I will tell you what danger: The world is perver&s;e, and mo&s;t men live out of truth, and the Devil is a cunning adver&s;ary, and he would have none live in it: <HI>He abode not in the truth;</HI> and he would not have us live in it, nor regulate our words and actions by the truth in our own &s;ouls: What if mo&s;t men in the world pervert the truth? What if &s;o few walk in the <HI>narrow way,</HI> and &s;o few come to life eternal; is that an argument that I mu&s;t not come there? Should it not &s;tir me up to greater diligence, that by any means I may be of the number of that few that &s;hall obtain &s;alvation, and not go with a great company in the way that leads to de&s;truction? If we improve our times, and &s;ea&s;ons, and opportunities, and mercies, and ble&s;&s;ings, that are vouch&s;afed to us, we at la&s;t may obtain life eternal.</P>
<P>But &s;ome may &s;ay, I mu&s;t &s;it down in de&s;pair, for I can|not come thither of my&s;elf, though I do what I can to <HI>work out my own &s;alvation.</HI> There is a decree again&s;t me; what, tho' I &s;hould pray ever &s;o much, and &s;pend my nights in grief and &s;orrow? If I be decreed to eternal damnation, there is no help for me, no hope that I &s;hould e&s;cape. And if I be decreed to &s;alvation, though I take my liberty to &s;in, and be loo&s;e and wanton, as others, it cannot hinder me from attaining &s;alvation at la&s;t.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on, many have laid a&s;ide the &s;piritual war|fare again&s;t corruption, and their &s;piritual travel, that they will do nothing in order to their everla&s;ting happine&s;s; therefore they think they had as good take their plea&s;ure: But, my friends, the ca&s;e is not now &s;o with us; let every &s;oul among us prai&s;e the Lord for his mercy, in expelling that

thick cloud of darkne&s;s, which is vani&s;hed and gone: This I know, and I hope you do all believe, that God doth every where, and in every nation, call &s;inners to repentance, and that <HI>he delighteth not in the death of him that dieth, but rather that they would turn and live;</HI> and in order thereunto, he hath given his Son, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to be a Saviour and a Medi|ator; and <HI>he hath &s;ent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts,</HI> to give direction to us in our way: Now our duty is, to make improvement of tho&s;e vi&s;itations of mercy, that God hath be&s;towed upon us, in order to our &s;alvation, and not live in <HI>rioting and drunkenne&s;s, chambering and wantonne&s;s, &s;trife and envying,</HI> and following the fa&s;hions of the world: But we mu&s;t <HI>work out our own &s;alvation with fear and trem|bling.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;ome will &s;ay, is not this done already? Is it not already wrought by our Saviour and Mediator? <HI>Chri&s;t hath ta&s;ted death for every man,</HI> and laid down a price for the &s;oul of every man.</P>
<P>But yet there mu&s;t be a change wrought in us; there mu&s;t be a tran&s;lation of our &s;ouls, from one &s;tate to ano|ther. This is called in the &s;cripture, regeneration, and be|ing born again; this is called a being baptized into Chri&s;t, and de&s;cribed al&s;o by other expre&s;&s;ions: But the matter is, to change thy life; for there is a &s;inful &s;ource of wick|edne&s;s, that is &s;tirred up by the motions of the powers of darkne&s;s, and our own concupi&s;cence; but God is al|ways ready to bring us under the government of his Holy Spirit, that will lead us into all truth; and this cannot be done without a Cro&s;s. But the que&s;tion lies here, &s;hall I take up this Cro&s;s or no? If I do, it will <HI>crucify me to the world.</HI> Let me &s;ee; how much do I love the world? A great deal: But do I love the world better than my own &s;oul? <HI>What will it profit me, to gain the whole world, and lo&s;e my own &s;oul?

He can &s;natch me away by death when he plea&s;eth; therefore will I labour, that my thoughts, words, actions and conver&s;a|tion,

may an&s;wer to that rule that he hath &s;et before me, as a &s;tandard of truth, to &s;quare and regulate my actions by. I will not live any longer in vanity, as many do; I do not know but my breath may be &s;topt to-day, be|fore to-morrow; therefore <HI>to-day, while it is called to-day, I will hear</HI> God's voice, <HI>and not harden my heart,</HI> but re|ceive that coun&s;el, that is offered to me, for the benefit of my &s;oul. I am bought with a price, I am none of my own; I will live to him that died for me: I have more rea&s;on to live to Chri&s;t, and &s;erve him, that &s;hed his precious blood for the redemption of my &s;oul, and to be &s;ubject to him, than to be &s;ubject to Chri&s;t's enemy, to the prince of the power of the air, who rules in the chil|dren of di&s;obedience. I will take up a re&s;olution to &s;erve God, but I can do nothing of my&s;elf; but <HI>the grace of God which brings &s;alvation, will teach me to deny ungod|line&s;s, and worldly lu&s;ts, and to live righteou&s;ly, &s;oberly and godly, in this pre&s;ent world.</HI> Take heed of being de|ceived and beguiled, for there is no way will bring you to Heaven, but a holy and undefiled way.</P>
<P>Therefore, come and take this, &s;tandard of truth in your hands, to guide you in your way, that you may neither turn to the right hand, nor to the left: This will &s;hew you the way you &s;hould walk in, and be like the cloud and pillar of fire to the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> in their journey to <HI>Ca|naan,</HI> which was a type of Heaven; the cloud they could &s;ee by day, and the pillar of fire by night; &s;o this &s;tand|ard of truth will direct you in your travel to the hea|venly <HI>Canaan.</HI> Let this be the rule and mea&s;ure of your thoughts, words and actions.</P>
<P>If a workman, that is a builder, hath a rule to work by; if he goes on, and never examines his work by his rule, but makes his eye his rule; if he doth not bring his rule to his work every little while, to &s;ee whether his Work be right; if he worketh on, and never minds his rule, what &s;ad work will he make. But a prudent skil|ful workman will &s;ay, I will not tru&s;t mine eye too much, but I will look to my rule, my rule will not fail me; if there be bad work, it will di&s;cover it to me, that I may mend it before I go any further.

<P>You to whom God hath given the &s;tandard of truth, as a rule and mea&s;ure to govern your thoughts, words and actions by, let every thing be tried with it, before you die, and leave this world: If you do &s;o, and make this your daily practice, then ask your&s;elves, and you will be able to tell your&s;elves, and tell me, and &s;ay, I have now obtained more hopes of God's favour, and a greater &s;en&s;e of his love and goodne&s;s to me, than ever I had before.

<P>BLESSED and eternal Father! thou ha&s;t brought forth thy glorious name, and revealed thy power and thy mighty arm; and thou ha&s;t cau&s;ed a remnant to bow and wor&s;hip at thy appearance: Thou art wonderful; thy maje&s;ty is great; they that do behold thee, will, with reverence, wor&s;hip before thee. Thy power is gone forth, and hath reached the hearts of thy people; thou ha&s;t humbled them, and &s;ubjected them to thy Divine, Almighty Power, that they might appear in the earth, to the prai&s;e and glory of thy great name.</P>
<P>And, O Lord, as thou ha&s;t begun a great work in the earth, &s;o thou ha&s;t committed this work to thy &s;ervants and children, that bear thy name among the &s;ons of men, that they &s;hould &s;hew

All our fitne&s;s and &s;ufficiency, our meetne&s;s and preparation is from thee: Do thou reveal thy power, and make bare thy Almighty arm. We have found thy pre&s;ence from day to day, and thou ha&s;t upheld them that know thy love.</P>
<P>O glorious God of Life! herein we have encouragement to go on in the work which thou ha&s;t called us to; hereby we are ena|bled to wor&s;hip before thee, and to offer up living prai&s;es unto thy great name, for that refre&s;hment and con&s;olation, which thou ha&s;t mini&s;tered unto thy people.</P>
<P>And, O Living Father! we have never waited on thee in vain; when&s;oever we have met together in thy name, we have found thy Divine Pre&s;ence, and the opening of the trea&s;ures of thy love, of thy wi&s;dom, and of thy favour to thy children: So that from day to day, and even at this day, thou remembere&s;t thy people, and thou give&s;t them fre&s;h occa&s;ion to draw nigh to thee, and receive their daily nouri&s;hment and &s;trength, from the operation of thy power.</P>
<P>O living God of Life! gather up the hearts of thy people more and more, and draw them into a nearne&s;s to thy&s;elf, that their under&s;tandings may be more and, more opened to di&s;cern thy will, and &s;ubject them&s;elves to thy wi&s;dom, that every thought that is exalted again&s;t thy divine power, and living voice, in their own con&s;ciences, may be brought down; that &s;o all the nations of the earth may bow before thee; that &s;o thy truth may reign, and thy power may be exalted, and the righteou&s;|ne&s;s which thou ha&s;t revealed, may &s;hine forth more and more, in the brightne&s;s and glory of it, and enlighten tho&s;e that are afar off, that they may be brought to &s;eek after God.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON V. <HI>The</HI> GREAT DUTY <HI>of</HI> REMEMBERING <HI>our</HI> CREATOR.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Preached at DEVONSHIRE-HOUSE, <DATE>April <HI>6, 1692.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>THERE is only <HI>one living and true God,</HI> Creator of Heaven and earth, whom we are obliged to &s;erve and wor&s;hip: I have &s;o much charity as to believe, there are none among us, but will own and acknowledge this: And my &s;oul wi&s;heth, that this obligation did always re&s;t upon every one's mind, that they might remember their Creator, that hath given us all life and breath, and continued all our ble&s;&s;ings to us; that &s;o every one might apply their hearts unto that univer&s;al duty, that we are all convinced of.</P>
<P>And they that are thus employed and exerci&s;ed, they are con&s;idering how, and after what manner, they may quit and di&s;charge their duty, and perform the obligation that lies upon them, &s;o that it may be accepted at the hands of God; I &s;peak now of tho&s;e that are con&s;iderate, not of tho&s;e that go on in a form of religion, and matter not, nor regard whe|ther they are accepted of God or no; but all that are con&s;ci|entious towards God, they are de&s;irous to &s;erve God, and wor&s;hip him, &s;o as they may be acceptable to him, &s;o to perform duties that they may receive their reward, and that encouragement that God in all ages hath di&s;covered, and made manife&s;t to be in his purpo&s;e towards them that truly &s;erve him.</P>
<P>When people come to this con&s;ideration, how they may &s;erve God aright, and wor&s;hip him acceptably, the Lord is high unto them, to in&s;truct them, to teach them, and guide them in that way that is everla&s;ting: And, ble&s;&s;ed be his holy
<PB N="57" REF="020309_0057_0FAEF6884B1065C0">
name! a great many in our days, have met with this divine teaching and in&s;truction; and are taught in this age, as in former ages, to under&s;tand the wor&s;hip of God that he re|quires; that is, in &s;pirit and truth; and do find, that the Father doth &s;eek &s;uch wor&s;hippers, and where he finds them, rewards them, and they have an an&s;wer of peace in their bo&s;oms, and they are encouraged to go on in the wor&s;hip and &s;ervice of God, to the end of their days.</P>
<P>And it is a great mercy and benefit; a great ble&s;&s;ing that God hath be&s;towed upon a remnant, to open their under|&s;tandings, to let them &s;ee and know the way of being near to God, that &s;o they may know whom they wor&s;hip; for you have read, there have been wor&s;hippers, that do wor&s;hip they know not what: As our Saviour &s;aid to the woman of <HI>Samaria, you wor&s;hip you know not what; we know what we wor&s;hip:</HI> So all that are taught of God, do know which is the fir&s;t le&s;&s;on of Chri&s;tianity, as the apo&s;tle &s;aith; <HI>he that cometh to God, mu&s;t fir&s;t know and believe, that he is;</HI> that is, people mu&s;t fir&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that <HI>there is a God, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently &s;eek him,</HI> before they can rightly wor&s;hip him.</P>
<P>Now, for want of this knowledge, the world is &s;cattered, and people are divided into a great many &s;orts of wor&s;hips, and fa&s;hions, and ways of religions, for want of the knowledge of the true wor&s;hip, of the true and living God; &s;o that though men are univer&s;ally convinced, that there is a God, and that a wor&s;hip is due to him from every one of us; yet people are confounded, &s;cattered, and divided about the performance of their great duty; and in the day that the Lord hath vi&s;ited his people, he hath come to an&s;wer this doubt, and que&s;tion for them; it hath been the great que&s;tion of the world, and is &s;till of many thou&s;ands; I know we &s;hould wor&s;hip God, but I know not the way and manner wherein to find acceptance: The Lord hath an&s;wer|ed that que&s;tion in abundance; <HI>they that have ears to hear, let them hear what the Spirit &s;aith;</HI> there is a &s;hort an&s;wer to it in all.</P>
<P>Let people profe&s;s what religion they will, there is no acceptance with God, but through Chri&s;t: So that if people come to be of this, and that, and the other profe&s;&s;ion, and
<PB N="58" REF="020309_0058_0FAEF68919204810">
change their religion ever &s;o often, and go from one religion to another, if they come not to Chri&s;t, they come not to him in whom they may find acceptance; in him God is plea&s;ed with every one; but out of him he is plea&s;ed with no one. The great my&s;tery of religion lies in Chri&s;t; people mu&s;t come to God, by faith in him; <HI>for without faith, it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God.</HI> Let people perform ever &s;o much &s;ervice and duties, all mu&s;t pa&s;s through the hand of the Mediator, before ever their performance will reach unto God, or before peace and comfort will reach to any man's &s;oul. Therefore, it is the wi&s;e&s;t way for every one, that would have acceptance with God, to come to him, in the name of the great Mediator. People would be glad to have acceptance with God, and not to have their &s;ervices turned back upon them, as <HI>Cain</HI>'s was: Now, every one that will have accep|tance with God, mu&s;t come this way; there is but one way, it is not the way that men have invented; &s;ome by their works and merits, &s;ome by their made-faiths, and made-beliefs, and by divers articles and principles, holding this principle, and the other principle; but our Lord and Cre|ator, he hath &s;ound out one way, in his infinite wi&s;dom, and un&s;peakable mercy to mankind, that was forever lo&s;t, and could never return to God, by all his &s;acrifices, offerings and performances; he was never able to return into unity with his Maker, if God had not &s;ound out a way; and the way that God hath found out, is by his beloved Son Chri&s;t Je&s;us: <HI>God &s;pared not:</HI> He &s;pared not what? He &s;pared not his only begotten Son: Why, what did he do with him? <HI>He gave him for the life of the world;</HI> in him that God gave, there is life. <HI>It plea&s;ed the Lord that his Son &s;hould have life in him, as the Father had life in him&s;elf;</HI> for Chri&s;t was <HI>with the Father before the world began; in him was life, and the life was the light of men;</HI> John i. 4. It was no created life; that life that is in his Son, is not a created life, but is an eternal life, and it was given for the life of the world, and that life is the light of men: <HI>This is the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</HI> So that here is the dignity of that life which God hath be&s;towed upon us; we are endued with that life, which was with the Father through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, before the world was. Let us con&s;ider the dignity of that light, that we are lighted with.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="020309_0059_0FAEF68A016F9D60">The que&s;tion is, whether we &s;hould obey this light, or no: It is the que&s;tion of every one; I am enlightened, &s;aith a man, &s;hall I obey it, or no? If I obey, I mu&s;t take up a cro&s;s, and part with my beloved lu&s;t and cor|ruption. No doubt of that; we mu&s;t per&s;uade people to do that, before we can bring them to Heaven and hap|pine&s;s, and fellow&s;hip with God; it mu&s;t not be by that way they lo&s;t it, but by the contrary way, by which God will bring men to happine&s;s again. They lo&s;t it by tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, and &s;inning again&s;t God; by this way and means men came out of the pre&s;ence and favour of God; but what way &s;hall they obtain it again? Shall it be by com|mitting iniquity, and breaking God's law? No; here is the way that God hath found out, to bring poor man back again to him&s;elf, by the &s;ufferings and obedience of his Son, Je&s;us Chri&s;t: <HI>He hath given to him all power in Heaven and Earth,</HI> that all &s;hould be &s;ubject to him; here is a dignity which Chri&s;t hath obtained.</P>
<P>It comes to the que&s;tion with us, whether we are en|lightened? now we know we are enlightened; God hath be&s;towed &s;omething upon us, that wars and fights again&s;t &s;in and iniquity. How came we by it? Is it any fa|culty in nature? No; nature is corrupted and defiled, be|cau&s;e <HI>the carnal mind is enmity again&s;t God; for it is not &s;ubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be;</HI> yet there is &s;omething in me that an&s;wers the pure law of God, which makes me to hate things that are reprovable; that is, light: How came I by it? It is not natural; for then it would run parallel with the natural inclination that is in my &s;oul, to lead me further and further from God. The&s;e are &s;et in oppo&s;ition one again&s;t another, the fle&s;h and the &s;pirit; <HI>the fle&s;h lu&s;teth again&s;t the &s;pirit, and the &s;pirit again&s;t the fle&s;h.</HI> Here is part of an inward war, that you may all be &s;en&s;ible of. Now, the&s;e two warri|ors, the fle&s;h and the &s;pirit, make war one again&s;t ano|ther, and one of them is overcome. It is true, there is &s;uch a principle in me, that &s;trives again&s;t &s;in and cor|ruption: How came you by it? If you believe the &s;crip|tures, I &s;ay, it is the life of the Son of God, <HI>that light|eth every man that cometh into the world.</HI> Now, many that

have rejected and de&s;pi&s;ed the light, I believe they did not think, at the &s;ame time, to mock and make a &s;corn of the life of Je&s;us, tho' it was really &s;o: But if people come to a true e&s;teem and value of that light that God hath planted in the &s;oul, they will give more reverence and re&s;pect to it. It is this that brings tho&s;e that preach Chri&s;t, to preach him in tho&s;e terms, and under tho&s;e de|nominations,that he is nigh them.</P>
<P>We do not doubt of Chri&s;t's being born of a Virgin, in the land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> and that he wrought miracles, and preached many godly &s;ermons, and that he was crucified, dead and buried, and ro&s;e again from the dead, for the&s;e things are certainly true: But we would have him our Sa|viour in this age, we would have a nearer knowledge of him, and a &s;en&s;e and feeling of the virtue of that power, by which he &s;aved them that lived in former ages: He is not a Chri&s;t and a Saviour of one age only, but of all ages to this day; from <HI>Adam,</HI> to the la&s;t man that &s;hall live upon the earth. That age and generation that knoweth not Chri&s;t, will not be &s;aved by him, if there be any age wherein he is not known: <HI>There is no other name under Heaven by which you can be &s;aved.</HI> If you ask where is this Saviour? <HI>Say not in thy heart, who &s;hall a&s;cend into Heaven? that is, to bring down Chri&s;t from above; or, who &s;hall de&s;cend into the deep, that is to bring up Chri&s;t again from the dead? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart; that is the word of faith, which we preach.</HI> He is nigh thy &s;oul, he is the Lord of life, and a quickening Spirit, if I know that quickening Spirit, after this I know the Lord Chri&s;t; when he comes to work in me by his power, changing my heart, and tran&s;lating me from death to life, then I know the true Chri&s;t: God hath mani|fe&s;ted, in all ages, that it is the duty of people to come to the knowledge of the Son of God; for <HI>he hath &s;ent forth his Spirit to teach us, and to lead us into all truth.</HI></P>
<P>For when Chri&s;t was with, his di&s;ciples, he told them that he would pray the Father, and he &s;hould <HI>&s;end the Spirit, the comforter;</HI> and when he came, he would be known by his divine and inward teachings and operations, guiding and <HI>leading them into all truth;</HI> that was his work to them: But what &s;hall other folks do? He will be made known to others
<PB N="61" REF="020309_0061_0FAEF68B5EB9E3F8">
too: When he comes, <HI>he &s;hall convince the world of &s;in:</HI> So that his work to his di&s;ciples was, to <HI>lead them into all truth;</HI> and his work to the world is, to <HI>convince the world of &s;in:</HI> Who will deny, but that there is a Spirit in our age, as well as in other ages, that will convince men of &s;in? Is this the Spirit of God, that convinceth the world of &s;in, or is it the &s;pirit of the <HI>QUAKERS only?</HI> When peo|ple come to con&s;ider really and truly, how they may &s;erve God aright, they will find there is no &s;erving God aright, unle&s;s they come to Chri&s;t the Mediator, that in and by him they may put up &s;upplications to God; and through him, they may expect at the hand of God, peace and comfort; and there is no other way, nor ever will be.</P>
<P>The Jews, they had another way, they had an outward way of &s;erving God; this &s;tood in divers offerings, &s;acrifices, wa&s;hings and ob&s;ervations; this was a way of wor&s;hip of God's own in&s;titution to that people; but what came of it? When the apo&s;tle came to gra&s;p it, he &s;aid, <HI>the comers there|unto, were not made perfect:</HI> What were the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of it then? They that would &s;in on, and continue in &s;in, and not bring a goat, or a ram, or other oblation; they that did ob&s;erve it, and came up to the point of the law, they did bring their offering when they were convinced of their &s;in: If a man &s;inned, he was to bring an he-goat, and to bring it to the door of the tabernacle; but when he &s;in|ned, the con&s;cience of &s;in, the guilt of &s;in remained upon him. <HI>For it was impo&s;&s;ible,</HI> &s;aith the apo&s;tle, <HI>that the blood of bulls and goats &s;hould take away the &s;in: For if the blood of bulls and goats, and the a&s;hes of a heifer &s;prinkling the unclean, &s;anctifieth, to the purifying of the fle&s;h, how much more &s;hall the blood of Chri&s;t (who, through the eternal Spirit, offered him&s;elf without &s;pot to God) purge your con&s;ciences from dead works, to &s;erve the living God.</HI></P>
<P>When there is no hope of atonement and reconciliation with God, by all tho&s;e offerings under the law, he tells you of <HI>one offering of the Son of God him&s;elf, through the eternal Spirit, by which he became a propitiation;</HI> for this will do <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> if I believe that Chri&s;t offered an holy offering to the Father for my &s;ins, I believe he offered his body, and that through the eternal Spirit, that he might be a propitiation for &s;in, and
<PB N="62" REF="020309_0062_0FAEF68C128CDEF0">
take away &s;in, and have power over &s;in and death, and con|quer death and darkne&s;s: The apo&s;tle drives the matter fur|ther; you mu&s;t come to the inward work of this outward offering, this eternal offering, that was in due time offered to God; you mu&s;t come to know the operations of it, by the <HI>&s;prinkling of the heart from an evil con&s;cience:</HI> So that there was to be an applicatory faith for the offering of that. The way to a Saviour was not made by man, no more than the way of &s;alvation by Chri&s;t was found out by man; no more than the application of the benefit is effected by man.</P>
<P>When it plea&s;eth God to call a people by his grace, he calleth them by his Son; not by this and the other form: <HI>No man cometh to me,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>except the Father, which hath &s;ent me, draw him.</HI> The fir&s;t thing that a man or woman comes to be aware of, is the &s;ecret &s;en&s;e and feel|ing of the Lord's Divine Power upon the heart, to feel Chri&s;t Je&s;us; as &s;oon as they feel this, and embrace it, this is a token of the love or God. I hope all this con|gregation will acknowledge, that they have &s;ometimes felt his drawings, and that they have not embraced and clo&s;ed with them &s;o well as they ought.</P>
<P>When people are aware of the&s;e drawings inwardly to holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and are &s;en&s;ible that they &s;hould, with care and attention, clo&s;e with them, for the good of their poor &s;ouls; and that it concerns them to be hap|py in the other world that is to come, and therefore re|&s;olve to be led by the&s;e drawings of the Spirit of God, the&s;e are not weeds that grow in the fields naturally; the&s;e are Sparks of Divine Fire, kindled in the hearts of men by God him&s;elf: No man comes unto God, till God comes to him, and touches him, and gives him &s;en&s;e and motion: The&s;e are the motions and &s;tirrings of God's Holy Power, in the hearts of many that are wicked and abominable; yet the Lord doth not de&s;pi&s;e the work of his own hand, but reacheth to &s;uch.</P>
<P>When the Lord meets with tho&s;e that de&s;pi&s;e not, but highly prize this wonderful grace, and clo&s;e with it, and are glad of it, &s;uch a one faith, I feared that the Lord had forgotten me, and had pa&s;&s;ed by me, and had done with me; but I &s;ee he vi&s;its me again, and he hath vi|&s;ited

my &s;oul this day, inclining me to walk more an&s;wer|ably to his love; he hath doubled his power upon me, and hath kindled a holy fire in my heart, and cau&s;ed me to &s;eek after him; he hath touched my heart, and I will pour out my &s;oul in &s;upplication; &s;eeing he hath touched me, he will take hold of me by his power, and he will keep me from being any more drawn away: I will live in the &s;en&s;e of his power and mercy, that keeps me night and day, that I may encrea&s;e in it, and grow in grace. When the Lord meets with &s;uch a one, he will draw him into the way that he hath appointed: <HI>None can come un|to me,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>except the Father, which hath &s;ent me, draw him.</HI> If I am drawn, into what form &s;hall I go now? and what ordinance &s;hall I take up now? This is all under feet; this is none of my work; I will come to Chri&s;t the Mediator, and he will take the government and rule of me: It is not my be&s;t way to &s;tudy a form, and an out&s;ide religion; I will wait upon that power that hath thus touched my heart, that he may by degrees bring me to the obedience of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But &s;ome are ready to &s;ay, who, and what is this Chri&s;t Je&s;us that you are &s;peaking of; that immediate Chri&s;t Je&s;us that is extant and pre&s;ent, that I am to have to be the object of my faith; that I may believe in him, and come to an ac|quaintance with him, that I may partake of the life of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and have it communicated to my &s;oul?</P>
<P>We have not a thought, or a word to &s;peak, that may derogate from the wonderful grace of Chri&s;t, who died in his per&s;on on earth for the &s;alvation of our &s;ouls: Yet we mu&s;t know, that the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t may be &s;piritually pre&s;ent with us, and take the government of us, and we are to be &s;ubject to him: How &s;hall this be? I am &s;peaking of one that hath felt the Father's drawings, when he draws them to his Son, and draws them to &s;omething that is holy and pure: This God the Father hath begotten: We read in &s;cripture, <HI>that God hath begotten Chri&s;t, who is the only begotten of the Father.</HI> It is &s;trange, you will &s;ay, to &s;peak of begetting Chri&s;t again, God begets Chri&s;t again, that is, &s;piritually; he being the fir&s;t born in many brethren, in every true believ|er, and there is a travel of &s;oul that Chri&s;t may be formed

in him. See what travel of &s;oul the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> falls into the &s;econd time, for the <HI>Galatians.</HI> They were a brave people, they wor&s;hiped God in Spirit, and believed in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and afterwards they came to be &s;educed by fal&s;e prophets, and fal&s;e teachers, that &s;et them about their works, and told them they could not be ju&s;tified and &s;aved without their own works: The&s;e fal&s;e teachers that came among them, were as bad as Popi&s;h prie&s;ts and friars. It is not your obe|dience to Chri&s;t, and the Spirit, that will &s;ave you, you mu&s;t be doing: So the&s;e poor people were deluded and bewitched; and to give you the apo&s;tle's own words, they were infa|tuated, and <HI>drawn away from the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel,</HI> and they thought by the works of the law to obtain &s;alvation: The apo&s;tle writes a letter to them, and tells them that he <HI>travelled in birth again, till Chri&s;t was formed in them.</HI> If this was not &s;cripture, it would look like a &s;trange work; there mu&s;t be a forming of Chri&s;t, a birth there mu&s;t be, and a begetting: Who mu&s;t beget in this and that moment, but the &s;ame that begat from the beginning? the &s;ame is the Father, he begets Chri&s;t in all that believe and obey the go&s;|pel. He is begetting &s;omething in me that is holy, though I be unholy; the Father, by the operation of his divine hand, begets &s;omething in me that is holy. This I find, though I am not &s;o good as I &s;hould be; I have that given me, that will tell me, that the more I adhere and join my&s;elf in my de&s;ires and affections to this good principle, the more I &s;hall partake of the quality of it; this good principle, though it be like <HI>a little grain of mu&s;tard-&s;eed,</HI> I cannot tell what to compare it to for littlene&s;s, in compari&s;on of the great lump and ma&s;s of &s;in, corruption and filthine&s;s, that wars again&s;t it; yet this will over&s;pread all that is bad, and make me <HI>holy,</HI> as that is <HI>holy; pure</HI> as that is <HI>pure,</HI> and to have a love for him, from whom it came, even to Chri&s;t and God; it will gather the affections from corruptible things, and place them upon things above.</P>
<P>This faith tells people that it is <HI>the &s;ub&s;tance of things hope for, and the evidence of things not &s;een;</HI> &s;uch a one live by faith, &s;uch a one that comes to be joined to that, that is begotten of the father, he <HI>lives by the faith of the Son of God,</HI> and can do nothing of him&s;elf, but through Chri&s;t that

&s;trengthens him; he &s;ays unto God, I perceive I can do nothing without thee; I cannot pray unto thee, nor &s;erve thee; of my&s;elf I can do nothing acceptably, but through Chri&s;t the Mediator; &s;uch a one becomes like a little child, and he mu&s;t be led; and who mu&s;t lead him, but the Spirit of Chri&s;t?</P>
<P>You cannot preach, &s;ays one to him, unle&s;s you be moved by the Spirit: You cannot pray until you be moved by the Spirit: How &s;hould I? No, without him I can do nothing, I cannot preach, nor pray, nor do any thing acceptable to God the Father, but by Chri&s;t; and he hath revealed him in me.</P>
<P>This is no new doctrine, we &s;ee the new and living way; it was an old way to old Chri&s;tians, and a new way to the new; and &s;o a thou&s;and years hence, if the world la&s;ts &s;o long, men will &s;ee that they cannot do any thing plea&s;ing to God, but as they are gathered into Chri&s;t; they will &s;ee their own righteou&s;ne&s;s, works and doings, will avail them nothing at all. This is all laid at the feet of Je&s;us, whom God hath exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour, to be Lord and King.</P>
<P>Now, my friends, we are engaged in this age, abundantly engaged, to offer thanks to God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that he hath provided and opened a way for the &s;ending forth the Spirit of his Son: And that God hath gathered a people, and hath made known to them the way of life, that they might walk in it; but there is no walking in it, but through a daily cro&s;s, and &s;elf-denial. It is not likely that a man &s;hould be brought back to God the &s;ame way that he went out from God; and the prophets and apo&s;tles do allude to this turning to God; <HI>when thou turne&s;t a&s;ide to the right hand or to the left, thou &s;halt hear a voice behind thee, &s;aying, this is the way, walk in it.</HI> There is a voice, that calls to people in our days, to look behind them, for they are out of the way. This pro|phecy is fulfilled in our day; we cannot turn away from the good ways of God, but we may hear a voice behind us, &s;ay|ing, thou art &s;inning again&s;t God, and breaking the holy law of God, Now, if people return, it mu&s;t be by the cro&s;s: I will not return to God, &s;aith one; I have plea&s;ure, profit, and honour, and what&s;oever my heart can de&s;ire, in this evil way that I am walking in; if I return, I &s;hall have nothing but &s;hame and reproach; I &s;hall be undone and ruined, and
<PB N="66" REF="020309_0066_0FAEF68FD2562EF0">
I &s;hall lo&s;e the favour and friend&s;hip of my friends and rela|tions; I cannot return to God, but through a daily cro&s;s, and &s;elf-denial: What then? It is likelier to be the right way, by this bearing the cro&s;s. Chri&s;t tells us, <HI>if any will come after me, let him deny him&s;elf, and take up his cro&s;s and follow me.</HI> This voice of Chri&s;t calls me to repent and turn from &s;in, and giveth me a &s;trong argument, that it is true; that it is the &s;ame way that will bring me back to God, by the Mediator. It brings its own evi|dence with it; we need no argument to prove that it is a right way; it is a right way, becau&s;e it is the <HI>narrow way;</HI> it is the right gate, becau&s;e it is the <HI>&s;trait gate.</HI> Every body can walk in the broad way with ea&s;e, with out any cro&s;s.</P>
<P>When people are come thus far, that they are convinced of their duty, when they are called to amend their lives and conver&s;ations, to for&s;ake their lives and turn to the Lord, this is the great que&s;tion, have I power to do this? This que&s;tion hath &s;tumbled a great many, when they have &s;ome beginning thoughts of turning to the Lord; and at la&s;t they have &s;ettled them&s;elves in a belief that they can|not do it; it is true, and nothing truer, that men, con|vinced of their &s;ins, have not power to leave their &s;ins of them&s;elves; this is true, but not all the truth; to men that God convinceth of &s;in, he gives them power to be made willing to for&s;ake their &s;ins. He hath given power to all that <HI>are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, to believe and become the &s;ons of God; then they have denied ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts,</HI> if they be the &s;ons of God, and <HI>live righteou&s;ly, &s;oberly and godly, in the world.</HI></P>
<P>But what &s;hall they do that are &s;en&s;ible they have not power to for&s;ake their &s;in, till God is plea&s;ed to give them power? Such have nothing to do but to wait upon the Lord, for the giving of this power; and there is a duty incumbent on them then to an&s;wer this power. The apo&s;tle, upon this &s;ubject, tells us what people are to do for their own conver&s;ion. He a&s;cribes the power of conver&s;ion to Chri&s;t Je&s;us: The prophets and apo&s;tles, they tell us, there is &s;omething for man to do, that is, if he hath not power, he is to be willing to receive it. The apo&s;tle hath a no|table

expre&s;&s;ion to this purpo&s;e; he puts them in mind, how they u&s;ed to do by the devil, when they were the devil's &s;ervants; they did obey his commands, and yield|ed their members &s;ervants to unrighteou&s;ne&s;s: How did they yield? They did it heartily, with plea&s;ure and delight. Thus you did when you did not know the power of God; but now you are come to the knowledge of the power of God, <HI>yield not your members as in&s;truments of unrigh|teou&s;ne&s;s unto &s;in, but yield your&s;elves unto God, as tho&s;e that are alive from the dead, and your members as in&s;tru|ments of righteou&s;ne&s;s unto God:</HI> Rom. vi. 13.

Living Father! it is the operation of thy Spirit that hath rai&s;ed the&s;e breathings, and kindled the&s;e de&s;ires in them, and it is thou alone who art able to an&s;wer them; therefore, living God and Father, they are committed to thee; the mourners, the bowed-down, and tho&s;e that are laden with &s;in and iniquity, and that groan under the pre&s;&s;ure and burden of it, let their bur|dens be taken off, and the yoke of Chri&s;t, that ea&s;y yoke, be put on, and let none of thy commandments be grievous to them, that they may be made meet to enter into thy kingdom; let them be brought through the labour and travel of regeneration, and let none be exalted into the airy vi&s;ion and &s;ight of things, but by thy living power, be ri&s;ing to eternal life in their &s;ouls.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="020309_0070_0FAEF692CD9A0670">And Lord, we pray thee, fit and prepare all thy people for the work and &s;ervice which thou ha&s;t been plea&s;ed to call them to, that &s;o thy name may be exalted over all, and thy truth &s;pread more and more; and let all error and darkne&s;s be ex|pelled, and let the power and influence of thy name be great in the earth, that all thy &s;cattered people may be brought home, to re&s;ide in thy hou&s;e, that there may be unity and concord among&s;t them, and they may all with one heart and mind, return, and a&s;cribe prai&s;es and honour, and glory to thy holy name, for all thy ble&s;&s;ings, mercies and living refre&s;h|ments, that we have received at thy hands, for thou alone art worthy, and God over all, ble&s;&s;ed forever and ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SERMON VI. <HI>The</HI> DIVINE MONITOR; <HI>or,</HI> LIGHT <HI>from</HI> HEAVEN.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Preached at GRACE-CHURCH-STREET, <DATE>June <HI>19, 1692.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>IT is a great privilege to the &s;ons and daughters of men, that it has plea&s;ed God Almighty to open a way, how they may come to the true knowledge of him|&s;elf. And O that there was a heart in every one of us, that could rightly prize this privilege as we ought to do! for in the knowledge of the true God con&s;i&s;ts our true happine&s;s; and without this, the mind of no man or wo|man can be good. There is nothing &s;ea&s;ons the mind and &s;oul of man, and prepares and fits it for an everla&s;ting well-being, but the divine knowledge of the living God that made him. And there is a propen&s;ity in the &s;oul of man, even &s;ince the fall, to return again to God, and to have that acquaintance and communion with the Lord that man had before he fell: And they that have regard to that inward &s;park of divine love, that they find in their own &s;ouls towards God, they will experience that the Lord is merciful and gracious, and propitious to that which is of him&s;elf</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="020309_0071_0FAEF693B59B53E0">For tho' the &s;oul is lo&s;t, and man is lo&s;t through tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, and a great alienation has happened between him and his Maker, yet the mercy of the Lord endureth for|ever; and his kindne&s;s and favour to lo&s;t man is &s;uch, that he &s;tretcheth out his hand all the day long, and pre|&s;ents and offers to the children of men a friend&s;hip and acquaintance, and a communion again with him. And tho' by &s;in and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, there is a rebellious nature grown up in the &s;ons and daughters of men, yet the &s;oul of man is not wholly &s;o; there is &s;omething that &s;trives and labours in a contrary way, and per&s;uades the &s;oul to turn again unto the Lord, and to wait for the knowledge of God; and who&s;oever hearkens with care and diligence, to that divine Monitor, that is daily drawing and per|&s;uading people to &s;eek after God, they come to under|&s;tand, that the Lord is not &s;o angry with mankind, but his love, and mercy, and good will, reaches towards all the &s;ons and daughters of men; and the bar that hinders their communion&punc; with God, and peace with God, it is not in the Lord, but it is in them&s;elves; and therefore the remedy mu&s;t be wrought in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This is evident to every eye, that there is &s;omething gotten into mankind, which the Holy God cannot own, and can never have fellow&s;hip with; that is, another con|trary &s;pirit hath wrought upon the &s;ouls of people, and hath &s;educed and drawn them out to that which is unholy and contrary to God, and the terms of God's covenant to mankind, which is, that he &s;hould for&s;ake that which the contrary &s;pirit hath wrought. <HI>Let the wicked for&s;ake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts.</HI> Why &s;hould he for&s;ake his ways? Becau&s;e the Lord never led him in|to tho&s;e ways. He that made him, never led him into them; but the devil, the enemy of mankind, &s;educed him into tho&s;e ways; therefore the Creator cries out to him, <HI>let the wicked for&s;ake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts;</HI> I cannot have union with him, as long as he walks in his evil ways; I cannot dwell in his mind, &s;o long as evil thoughts are in it: So may the Lord com|plain of the works which the devil hath wrought, that man is carried away from God, by his evil thoughts, and the works of the devil.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="020309_0072_0FAEF695037E7860">Why doth not God de&s;troy tho&s;e works, when he is Almighty, and able to do it? Very true, God is &s;o; but he hath offered to mankind, through the &s;on of his love, a way and means, how man may come to be purged, and clean&s;ed from the evil that the devil hath wrought in him, and how he may come to be reconciled to God: God hath not cho&s;en the way of coercion and force, and to work altogether by irre&s;i&s;tible power, that man &s;hall go to Heaven whether he will or no: There was no force u&s;ed for his going to hell and darkne&s;s, but it was the choice of his will: The devil could not have forced him, and led him away out of covenant with God, he could not compel him to break the holy command of God; but the devil tempted him, and he yielded to the temptation, and now man is driven out of the pre&s;ence of God; yet God hath found out a way for the &s;ons and daughters of men, to turn again to him: What by force and coercion, and irre&s;i&s;table power? No, but the &s;cripture &s;aith, He hath offered life and &s;alvation to all men: <HI>He hath freely given the Son of his love, out of his own bo&s;om, who making him&s;elf an offering for &s;in, hath pre&s;ented a way and meant for man's returning again to God.</HI></P>
<P>How doth God pre&s;ent Chri&s;t to us? He pre&s;ents him to the view of every one's mind, to the under&s;tanding of every &s;oul; he offers and pre&s;ents him for &s;alvation to the ends of the earth. There is a damnation come in by man's being &s;ubject to Satan, but &s;alvation comes in by his being &s;ubject to Chri&s;t; as damnation came in by his being defiled, &s;o &s;alvation came in by his being clean&s;ed: As the devil is the defiler, &s;o Chri&s;t is the clean&s;er, and man is the object upon which both do work; and they that have been defiled and corrupted (as we all have) by the unclean Spirit, can any of us give a rea&s;on they &s;hould not be clean&s;ed by the holy Spirit? We have lo&s;t our right to Heaven by &s;in and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, in the fir&s;t <HI>Adam;</HI> and can any give a rea&s;on, why we &s;hould not be re&s;tored, and redeemed, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the &s;econd <HI>Adam?</HI> No rea&s;on can be given of our redemption, but that God is free in his love, and Chri&s;t in his offering: <HI>He hath offered him&s;elf a &s;acrifice for &s;in: Every prie&s;t hath &s;omething to offer; this man, the man
<PB N="73" REF="020309_0073_0FAEF6951C6AFE70">
Chri&s;t Je&s;us, offered him&s;elf, through the eternal Spirit, a &s;acrifice for &s;in; and now the &s;acrifice is offered, and a door is opened, and a new and living way con&s;ecrated through the veil, that is to &s;ay, his fle&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>Now, who can be wi&s;e enough to find out a rea&s;on, why all men enter not in at this door? For all men enter in at the other door, which the devil and Adam opened, to run from God; all could run in at that door. What is the rea&s;on, that all go not in at that door which Chri&s;t hath opened, and God hath revealed, and which co&s;t Chri&s;t &s;o dear to work our way back again, for mankind to return to God? If we go about to enquire into the rea&s;on, we &s;hall find it very little, for there is all the rea&s;on in the world we &s;hould &s;erve God, and &s;eek our own happine&s;s; there is all the rea&s;on in the world we &s;hould part with &s;in and iniquity, and with the devil's work, which he wrought, if we knew but how: Now this, I &s;ay, is a great privilege, that God hath afforded to the &s;ons and daughters of men, that they may know; for here the terms of the go&s;pel and of &s;alva|tion, are brought into a narrow compa&s;s, to a &s;hort &s;um, there need no catalogue of them; they that will be ruled by the wicked one, mu&s;t have their part with him; and they that will be ruled and governed by the Holy One, &s;hall have their part with him, <HI>that where he is, there they may be al&s;o.</HI></P>
<P>Is this in the power of man's will? No, there lies the mi&s;chief in the will of man; for you cannot but know by experience, if a man may have his own will, he will always run headlong to de&s;truction, and run in the way of wicked|ne&s;s: And if ever he comes to turn out of that way, into the way of righteou&s;ne&s;s, he mu&s;t do it in a way that is a cro&s;s to his own will. Some have &s;aid, becau&s;e we have &s;poken of the free grace of God, in a way that is univer&s;al, of his kindne&s;s to mankind, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they have &s;aid, that we hold free-will, that men might be &s;aved if they would; but alas, we have tried it, and we have an univer&s;al knowledge, that is able to convince us, and all the world, that it is far enough from our own will. Man is far enough from being able to &s;ave him&s;elf, from being &s;aved by his own will: He can run on to damnation, there is a current goes
<PB N="74" REF="020309_0074_0FAEF695CD0275A8">
with his affections, and with his corrupt de&s;ires, they go with the current and &s;tream; as long as a man goes on in &s;in, he &s;wims down the &s;tream.</P>
<P>Now many, after they have long gone on in &s;in, and their evil ways, they think or returning to God; for they think there is a better way, a &s;urer and &s;afer way for their &s;ouls, than to go on in wickedne&s;s: So there is; if there be &s;o, &s;aith the &s;incere &s;oul, O that I might walk in it: Why do&s;t thou not? I am convinced that I &s;ee a more excellent way than my way is, a better walking and conver&s;ation than my life is; but alas! it is too hard for me to walk in it: Why? what is the matter, what makes it hard? becau&s;e of my own will; I cannot walk in it and have my will, I cannot walk in it, and enjoy my affections and de&s;ires, and my intere&s;t in the world: This is no wonder that thou telle&s;t me; now thou art convinced of a better way, and woulde&s;t walk in it, and thou can&s;t not walk in it, but thou mu&s;t take up a daily cro&s;s; we might all of us tell that, and read it before; I pray God you may come to read it within, what a cro&s;s it is you are to take up, and what way it is you are re|quired to walk in; that is the way of God, the way that leads to Heaven, it is a narrow way; but the way that the devil would have you to walk in, is a broad way, there is no rub in it.</P>
<P>O would you but once come to experience how hard it is to walk in that <HI>way that leads to life,</HI> you would find that you cannot do it without &s;elf-denial: It comes to this point; I have read of it before, but now I find it &s;o. Such a man, or &s;uch a woman, will &s;eriou&s;ly apply them&s;elves to live blamele&s;s, harmle&s;s, and inoffen&s;ive towards God and men; they will &s;et a bridle, and a watch before their mouths, that they may not &s;peak a vain word; they will take care of the frame and temper of their minds, that they &s;in not in their thoughts, that they &s;in not with their lips, nor with their hands. This is not as I was wont to do; I was u&s;ed to have my liberty; now I find my&s;elf yoked, I dare not &s;in again&s;t God: Now I find, by ex|perience, what I heard before, that no man can follow Chri&s;t, without denying him&s;elf, and taking up a daily cro&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="020309_0075_0FAEF696C79FA900">I would have you experienced in this work; wicked men think it a plea&s;ant life, to follow the devil's work, and to walk in the <HI>broad way;</HI> but the way of &s;elf-denial is unea&s;y, there is much &s;trife and oppo&s;ition in that way; If I have a mind to &s;peak a vain word, I am limited; if I have a de&s;ire to wrong my neighbour, and cheat and defraud him, I am limited, I am not to do it, that belongs to the broad way: If a man will &s;eek after the Lord, and walk in the way of holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, the end whereof is peace, he will find it is a narrow way, wherein he can|not enjoy his own will; &s;uch a one mu&s;t be a <HI>David,</HI> who &s;aid, <HI>I behaved my&s;elf as a weaned child;</HI> that is, as one that is afraid to be beaten.</P>
<P>But thou wilt be ready to &s;ay, I am a man, and not a child; I am come now to be a man, a man of parts; I have &s;een much, and read much, and would you have me become a child? How great a man was <HI>David:</HI> If you &s;peak of a man, he was a man of dignity and ho|nour, a man of valour and experience; yet when he &s;peaks with re&s;pect to the frame of his mind before the Lord, he &s;aith, he behaved him&s;elf <HI>as a weaned child,</HI> as one that feared to be beaten, feared to commit an offence; he feared the rod of his God upon him; he feared &s;omething of judgment upon his con&s;cience. <HI>David</HI> was an old te&s;|tament man, but he had regard to that which never wax|eth old, which is the &s;ame in all times, new and old, <HI>Alpha</HI> and <HI>Omega.</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us was his leader, before he was born of the <HI>Virgin Mary;</HI> his word was a light to his feet, and a lanthorn to his paths: <HI>David</HI> had acquain|tance with God, who did lift up the light of his coun|tenance upon him.</P>
<P>And when Chri&s;t him&s;elf came to preach upon earth, he &s;aith him&s;elf, <HI>every one that comes into the kingdom of God, mu&s;t become as a little child.</HI> He mu&s;t become as a little child in &s;implicity and &s;ubjection; he mu&s;t be un|der government; he mu&s;t become as a little child, or he mu&s;t in no wi&s;e enter the kingdom of Heaven; they mu&s;t not think to enter into Chri&s;t's kingdom becau&s;e they are men; men of parts, men of courage, men of under&s;tand|ing, learned doctors, ma&s;ters of liberal arts and &s;ciences:
<PB N="76" REF="020309_0076_0FAEF698AA47A390">
The&s;e may help to make them men, but they mu&s;t be children; all their wits, and parts, and manhood, courage and valour, will do them no good; for little children, babes and &s;ucklings, may under&s;tand more than they of Divine My&s;teries, and have greater communion and intercour&s;e be|tween God and their &s;ouls than they; &s;o that all who enter into Chri&s;t's kingdom, mu&s;t become like little chil|dren.</P>
<P>So that here is a way provided by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for man to come again into the favour of God, which is by Chri&s;t alone, not by any thing that a man can do; Chri&s;t mu&s;t be their leader and their coun&s;ellor, he alone can give them the true knowledge of God. <HI>No man can know the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son reveals him.</HI> Men can never attain to the &s;aving knowledge of God by &s;tudy, and by di&s;putation and reading books, and commentators, and ob&s;ervators of matters of religion, Time would fail me to &s;peak of the multitude of books that have been written about the knowledge of God. You mu&s;t come to Chri&s;t for divine knowledge; theology, the know|ledge of God, and divine and heavenly things, are from Chri&s;t: He &s;hall have this divine knowledge, be he ever &s;o &s;imple, that comes unto Chri&s;t for it; he cannot have it any other way, for God hath ordained this way: Saith God, he &s;hall have it of my Son, who is the Reconciles&punc; the Mediator between God and man, he &s;hall be beholden to Chri&s;t for all. All men's own works and labours will not ju&s;tify and &s;ave them, for God hath committed the whole work of &s;alvation to Chri&s;t. One would think it &s;hould be no great matter for men to lay a&s;ide their own works and duties, and &s;ubmit to Chri&s;t; but I tell you it is very hard, and I found it hard my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Men think by reading and learning, and hearing this and the other man's notions and opinions, they may be edified and profited, and come to the true knowledge of God; but while they are waiting upon God, in the way he hath appointed, they may receive knowledge from Chri&s;t, and be more certain and infallible in what they do know, than by con&s;ulting all the wi&s;e men and learned doctors in the world. For no man knows all at once; and no man
<PB N="77" REF="020309_0077_0FAEF699F2245978">
knows all things neither: It is not a thing nece&s;&s;ary that man &s;hould know all things in relation to God; for as he is in him&s;elf, he is incomprehen&s;ible: <HI>For no man knows the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son &s;hall re|veal him;</HI> yet that which he knows of God, he may know it is certain and infallible.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e a man know nothing of God, but that he is the <HI>&s;earcher of the heart, and trier of the reins.</HI> There are many that have tried this, and &s;ay they know it, that yet doubt whether there be a God or no. But when God comes within them, and convinces them of &s;in, and &s;earch|es them, and brings judgment upon them for what they have done, then they know infallibly, that God is <HI>the &s;earcher of hearts.</HI> This is not a man's work, this is the work of God; if I find God doth approach my &s;pirit, I know it is God's work; I have now got &s;ome knowledge of God, how came I by it? Who gave it me? No one but he that hath all knowledge; he that was with the Fa|ther from the beginning, and was glorified with the Fa|ther before the world began, he gave me this know|ledge; and now did he give it thee? By his Spirit; <HI>for he hath &s;ent forth the Spirit of his Son into my heart;</HI> and that Spirit of Chri&s;t &s;earches the hearts, and tries the reins. He tells me this is evil that thou ha&s;t done, this is that which God that made thee hath again&s;t thee; this thou mu&s;t for&s;ake, and this thou mu&s;t repent of; here I have an in|fallibility of what I know, but I cannot get rid of my evil.</P>
<P>Now if I can believe in the power by which my heart is &s;earched, and tru&s;t in him that hath begun to deal with me, then his work is not only to reveal his light to convince me, but to put forth his power to convert me; &s;o that by the power of that truth by which my heart is &s;earched, I come to be converted, and turned from my &s;in, and break off from it; and when I am broken off from it, I am &s;ure, and have a certainty that it is &s;o, that I am broken off from &s;uch a &s;in, and that my heart is turned again&s;t it; I am &s;ure that now I hate it, and dete&s;t it, and that God hath turned my inclinations another way: I am &s;ure this is God's work, I can witne&s;s this infallibly, that &s;omething is now done in
<PB N="78" REF="020309_0078_0FAEF69AE50825F8">
order to my redemption: But there is &s;omething yet re|maining to be done: What then? I will go &s;tep by &s;tep, by following my guide, I &s;hall be &s;ure to be making &s;ome progre&s;s every day, to that &s;tate to which the Spirit of Chri&s;t will lead me: The&s;e per&s;ons come to a certainty of knowledge by their own experience.</P>
<P>Some will &s;ay, take heed of being deluded and deceived by the <HI>Quakers;</HI> &s;o &s;ay I too: Take heed of being deluded by any body; if any go about to per&s;uade thee, to believe that which thou knowe&s;t to be a lye, I am &s;ure they are about to delude thee; I would have every one to have an evidence in them&s;elves of what they believe.</P>
<P>Doth a man believe that &s;uch a one is a drunkard, be|cau&s;e the &s;criptures declare judgment again&s;t the drunkards? the &s;cripture &s;aith, <HI>wo to the drunkards of</HI> Ephraim: There are judgments denounced again&s;t the drunkards in the old te&s;tament; con&s;ider the &s;cripture doth not tell &s;uch and &s;uch by name, that they are drunkards; but the Spirit of God, by a work and operation upon a man's con&s;cience, &s;ingles him out, and charges him with the guilt of drunken|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>There is a great condemnation pronounced again&s;t whore|mongers in &s;cripture, but it doth not tell us who they are by name; but their con&s;ciences tell them &s;o, and gives in|fallible judgment again&s;t them, and &s;ay, <HI>thou art the man,</HI> thou art a per&s;on that God doth judge and condemn; <HI>whoremongers and adulterers, God will judge;</HI> but that doth not concern thee, and affect thee, except thou be one; I may read this an hundred times in the &s;cripture, and not have a reflection in my own con&s;cience, except I be guilty: But when God meets with a guilty per&s;on, and judgeth and condemneth him, there will be an infallibility in what &s;uch a one knows. If a whoremonger is reflected upon by his own con&s;cience, if his con&s;cience tell him he is the man, if all the world &s;hould flatter him, and &s;ay he is not guilty, he would certainly know that they tell him a lye.</P>
<P>So that here is no dependence upon any man's judgment, but upon an invi&s;ible judge in a man's own heart: Who &s;hall delude and deceive this man, that hath this experimental knowledge? tho&s;e per&s;ons will not deceive a man, that
<PB N="79" REF="020309_0079_0FAEF69C775976D0">
would turn him from the evil of his ways; the&s;e do not go about to deceive him, that will tell him he mu&s;t hearken to that principle of truth and holine&s;s in his own heart; they would deceive him that tell him he is converted when he is not, and leave him there: But when he is really convert|ed and turned from &s;in to God, &s;ome will tell him he is deluded and deceived; I pray God every one of us may be &s;o deceived: Saith the apo&s;tle, <HI>we are deceivers, yet true:</HI> All that are truly converted, though men cry out they are deceivers, though they are deceivers, yet true; they are come to the &s;avour of the knowledge of God, through Chri&s;t; and &s;o &s;hall certainly <HI>come to be partakers of the inheritance that is undefiled, and that fadeth not away.</HI></P>
<P>Friends, you know that this hath been the propo&s;ition of all the prophets, and apo&s;tles, from the beginning to this day; the thing that they have propo&s;ed to the &s;ons and daughters of men, hath been to enquire after the know|ledge of the true God: It hath been wonderful to con|&s;ider, what the devil hath done to pre&s;ent divers doctrines that he hath found out, and &s;tirred up others to invent a company of Gods, that other people have adored and wor|&s;hipped. It is hard to find any nation that do not wor&s;hip &s;ome God; it is natural for man to de&s;ire to come to &s;ome God, he thinks he mu&s;t come to &s;ome God, and cannot be happy if he come not to GOD: But the devil hath invented many Gods, and &s;et the people a wor&s;hipping of idols, the work of men's hands, &s;uch Gods that are &s;o far from help|ing their wor&s;hippers, that they cannot help them&s;elves, they cannot wipe off the du&s;t from their own faces; and if they fall down, they cannot ri&s;e again.</P>
<P>But this is not our ca&s;e, we have but one God preached among us, and but one Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Mediator be|tween God and man: Our condition is happy, in having but one God, in compari&s;on of theirs that have many Gods.</P>
<P>If the true God, that you wor&s;hip, were but tru&s;ted in, you would be the happie&s;t people in the world: If you do but &s;earch, you will find that the devil hath in this nation, and in this age, &s;tirred up people to wor&s;hip as many Gods, as he did in other nations in ancient times, among the <HI>Sido|nians,</HI> and <HI>Amorites,</HI> and others.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="020309_0080_0FAEF69C91DD93F0">But you will &s;ay, we wor&s;hip one God, and tru&s;t only in one God, and one Chri&s;t, and one Holy Gho&s;t, the only living and true God.</P>
<P>Do not tell me what God a man profe&s;&s;eth to wor&s;hip&punc; but what God he tru&s;teth in, that gives it the name: What|&s;oever a man tru&s;teth in, that he makes his God, whether it be gold or &s;ilver, or the honours and plea&s;ures of this world, if he tru&s;teth in the&s;e things, he makes them his God. Let a man but &s;earch and try him&s;elf, and he will find &s;ome|thing hath got a place in his heart, that he cannot part with for Chri&s;t's &s;ake. He will be ready to &s;ay, I cannot part with my hou&s;e and land, with my wife and children, and my goods and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, becau&s;e I have a confidence in them, and believe they will do me good, and be a defence for me; I tru&s;t that in times of peril tho&s;e things may do me good. Here is a divine adoration, here is that tru&s;t, that confidence, that all true Chri&s;tians ought to have in the true God, and this is placed in the&s;e earthly things. Now, where&s;oever the tru&s;t and confidence is placed in tran&s;itory and earthly peri&s;hing things, the&s;e men tru&s;t in tran&s;itory Gods.</P>
<P>Nothing &s;o &s;hews that a man makes the Lord his God, as when he ca&s;ts all care on him, and puts his whole tru&s;t in him, when he makes a profe&s;&s;ion and acknowledgment of his dominion and greatne&s;s, and of all his other perfections, that by his wi&s;dom he can procure for them all that is good, and by his power, keep off from them, and &s;ecure them from evil. When I make the Lord my tru&s;t and refuge, and tru&s;t him for my God, I choo&s;e him before all the Gods of the Heathen, and tru&s;t in him above all things under Heaven, upon the account of the profundity of his wi&s;dom, and the almightine&s;s of his power: When a man hath this &s;en&s;e upon him, he will walk before the Lord with re&s;ignation of mind, and be willing to be at God's di&s;po&s;al, and he will not only give up him&s;elf to God, but he will hearken to him, and hear his voice when he &s;peaks to him.</P>
<P><HI>God, who at &s;undry times, and in divers manners &s;pake in time pa&s;t, unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in the&s;e la&s;t days &s;poken to us by his Son:</HI> But, where is his Son, you will &s;ay? He is in Heaven; but though he is <HI>the high
<PB N="81" REF="020309_0081_0FAEF69D61C8D978">
and lofty one that inhabits eternity, yet he dwells with meek, humble and contrite hearts, that tremble at his word.</HI> If I be one of the number of tho&s;e that tremble at God's word, I have that promi&s;e that he will come home to me, and dwell with me. It is well for thee, if the over-ruling power of God hath prevailed upon thee, that thou can&s;t be willing to be at God's di&s;po&s;al, and &s;ay, Lord, what woulde&s;t thou have me to do?</P>
<P>Therefore, friends, I would advi&s;e you all to love your own &s;ouls, that when God de&s;ires your hearts, you would give them up to him, that there he might delight to dwell, and have his habitation. Hearken to God's voice, and have regard to his word, which is a more &s;ure word than any man's in the world. <HI>There is a more &s;ure word of prophecy,</HI> &s;aith the apo&s;tle, <HI>unto which you will do well to take heed.</HI> This will check you, and reprove you, when you do evil, and &s;hew you wherein you have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed; and will encourage you, and be a comfort to you, when you do that which is good. This will <HI>make you wi&s;e to &s;alvation, and thoroughly furni&s;h you, and give you under|&s;tanding for every good work.</HI> This word will tell you, this you mu&s;t not do, le&s;t you offend God, and wound your con&s;cience, and grieve the Holy Spirit; this word will help you &s;o to &s;peak, as to admini&s;ter grace to the hearers; &s;uch a one as hath regard to this word, hath a chaplain in his own bo&s;om, that will direct and teach him how to &s;teer his cour&s;e, and order his conver&s;ation among men, and how <HI>to &s;erve God acceptably.</HI> This <HI>High Prie&s;t's lips will pre&s;erve knowledge,</HI> even Je&s;us Chri&s;t the righte|ous, who &s;peaks to us in his word; we can do nothing but by his direction: If you come to him to lead you into all truth, he will bring you to the Father, and recon|cile you to him, that &s;o you may obtain his favour and everla&s;ting life. When one of Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples &s;aid, <HI>&s;hew us the Father, and it &s;ufficeth us,</HI> Je&s;us &s;aith unto him, <HI>he that hath &s;een me, hath &s;een the Father, and how &s;aye&s;t thou then, &s;hew us the Father?</HI> If you &s;ubject your&s;elves to Chri&s;t, and to the government of his Spirit, he will bring you to that life and immortality, that <HI>fadeth not away.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SERMON VII. <HI>The</HI> INWARD PREACHER; <HI>or, the</HI> OFFICE <HI>of</HI> CONSCIENCE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Preached at GRACE-CHURCH-STREET, <DATE>June 21, 1692.</DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MANY have been &s;ent among you, that from living experience have declared their te&s;timony for the truth, that you might all be brought to wait for the te&s;timony of truth in your&s;elves. This is that which
<PB N="85" REF="020309_0085_0FAEF6A04E9F7050">
will &s;tand you in &s;tead, to know the te&s;timony of truth in your own hearts to be for you; therefore you are to wait, e&s;pecially at &s;uch times as the&s;e, to hear the voice of truth in your own &s;ouls: For what&s;oever the preacher preacheth, if the truth in thine own heart doth not &s;peak peace, it is not well with thee. What&s;oever te&s;timonies are born of the truth it&s;elf; it is the truth that mu&s;t bear te&s;timony of thee, that unerring word, that gives to every one an infal|lible evidence of their peace with God, or again&s;t that which hinders them.</P>
<P>You know our labour hath been to per&s;uade all people to hearken to the truth in them&s;elves, and to make it their bu&s;ine&s;s, and travel, and endeavour, that they might have unity with the truth in their own hearts, that their con|&s;ciences may not condemn them.</P>
<P>For &s;uch as you, in whom God hath rai&s;ed his witne&s;s, and hath exalted the truth for a judge, you are not igno|rant, nor covered over with darkne&s;s, as many others are; you do not remain in doubt, but you know the truth, and have an an&s;wer of peace in well-doing, and a condemnation in evil-doing; not admini&s;tered to you only by preachers without, but by the evidence and demon&s;tration of the Spirit of God in your own hearts. This is that &s;tanding my&s;tery which God hath rai&s;ed, which can never be put down again, but as each one may put it down in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I grant that men may put it down: You have read, and had it plainly witne&s;&s;ed to you, even <HI>killing the ju&s;t, and crucifying the Lord of Glory; and of &s;piritual</HI> Sodom, <HI>and</HI> Egypt. The&s;e things you have read of, and you that are turned to the light, know the meaning of tho&s;e &s;ayings, by woful experience; for when ever you have turned a&s;ide, from a due &s;ubjection to the grace of God, by which we are convinced, then there hath been a piercing, <HI>and cru|cifying of the Son of God afre&s;h, and vexing and griev|ing the Holy Spirit, by which you &s;hould be &s;ealed to the day of redemption:</HI> Then there hath been angui&s;h and tri|bulation upon your &s;ouls; and if this be minded, it will plant a fear upon your minds, and make you afraid to do the like again; but where this tribulation and angui&s;h is neglected and put off, there a cu&s;tom of &s;in takes away
<PB N="86" REF="020309_0086_0FAEF6A2A92D07E8">
the &s;en&s;e of &s;in. You know many have had more judg|ment at &s;ome time upon them for a vain word, or a vain thought, than afterwards they have come to have for the mo&s;t abominable wicked action. How came this to pa&s;s? Was &s;in ever the better? Or hath it changed its nature? No; but they are further off from the &s;en&s;e of the evil of it. This is the word of truth, to which you mu&s;t &s;tand or fall; this is the &s;tone, that who&s;oever falls upon it, &s;hall be broken and tendered; but if they &s;tay till the weight of truth fall upon them, it will grind them to powder.</P>
<P>They will have a life of liberty, let the truth &s;ay what it will: I will have my liberty, and u&s;e my tongue as I li&s;t, I will be wanton and proud, and envious and mali|cious, tho' I know the&s;e things be naught, and the witne&s;s in my con&s;cience te&s;tifies that the&s;e things are wicked, and contrary to the will of God, yet I will have them: Who|&s;oever comes to this mind, the &s;tone is near falling upon them, and they will be ground to powder; they are like to barren earth, which beareth thorns and briers, and is rejected, <HI>and is nigh unto cur&s;ing, who&s;e end is to be burned.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, friends, I entreat you to hearken to the word of the Lord, it is a holy word, and an old word; many have profe&s;&s;ed it: There are many preachers that will cry, hearken to the word of the Lord in &s;uch a chapter, and &s;uch a ver&s;e. My te&s;timony this day is, hearken to the word of the Lord: But where &s;hall we find it, &s;ome will &s;ay? I tell you, it is written with the finger of God in your own con&s;ciences; and it is either for you, or again&s;t you. Let your profe&s;&s;ion among men be what it will, this Mini&s;ter of the Covenant hath no re&s;pect of per&s;ons, or regard to profe&s;&s;ion; he will not excu&s;e this or that man, becau&s;e he makes a greater profe&s;&s;ion of his name than others; this rather is his judgment, and his condem|nation &s;hall be more &s;wift and &s;harp upon him that makes a profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t's name. <HI>If judgment begin at the hou&s;e of God, what will the end of them be that obey not the go&s;pel of God.</HI> Tho&s;e that take upon them a &s;trict profe&s;&s;ion, they do greater di&s;honour to God, than tho&s;e that cry out there is no reforming; there can be no liv|ing
<PB N="87" REF="020309_0087_0FAEF6A407FAC150">
without &s;in: The&s;e profe&s;s what they do, and they do as they profe&s;s. But when people come to profe&s;s ho|line&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and profe&s;s a power al&s;o by which righteou&s;ne&s;s is obtained, but live not &s;trictly according to their profe&s;&s;ion; the&s;e are they <HI>that cau&s;e the name of God to be bla&s;phemed among the Heathen,</HI> more than they that &s;ay there can be no living without &s;in.</P>
<P>Now this witne&s;s of God hath no re&s;pect to profe&s;&s;ion, but hath re&s;pect to the &s;tate and frame of the mind of a man or woman, that they &s;erve God with, whether it be with &s;incerity and uprightne&s;s of mind, and with breathing de&s;ires, that <HI>they may know the good and acceptable will of God, and what is well-plea&s;ing in his &s;ight;</HI> and that they might perform that which is according to his hea|venly will. Where this &s;incerity is, where this cry of the &s;oul is, the Lord hath regard to it; but where people's religion is only to bear up a profe&s;&s;ion, and hold up an ex|ternal fellow&s;hip and communion one with another; when this &s;incerity is wanting, the Lord abhors their wor&s;hip, it is an abomination to God, and no benefit or advantage to them&s;elves: It is not for the glory of God, that they make a profe&s;&s;ion, but for &s;ome de&s;ign to them&s;elves, and &s;o they become abominable.</P>
<P>This was the &s;tate of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> of old, and it is the &s;tate of a great many now, that think they do great matters, if they conform &s;o far to the truth, as that outwardly they may not be charged with a lye, and that they are of &s;uch a &s;ociety. It is well if &s;ome would come &s;o far as to main|tain their &s;ociety with God's people, and their external profe&s;&s;ion; but if they have not regard to the truth in their own con&s;ciences, what is their profe&s;&s;ion worth? What will all thy unity with them &s;ignify? If there be a breach be|tween God and thine own &s;oul, who can heal that breach? What will the profe&s;&s;ion &s;ignify and amount to at la&s;t? But, <HI>go ye cur&s;ed into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.</HI> And all the rea&s;on to be rendered for it, is this; depart from me, <HI>ye are workers of iniquity:</HI> He did not &s;ay in that &s;entence, ye are lyars, you never prophe&s;ied in my name, and I never preached in your &s;treets; but allowing what they &s;aid to be truth, that they had made a profe&s;&s;ion, and
<PB N="88" REF="020309_0088_0FAEF6A41D31A9D0">
held communion with other Chri&s;tians, allowing the&s;e things, yet notwith&s;tanding it is, <HI>go ye cur&s;ed;</HI> and the rea&s;on of the &s;entence is, <HI>you are workers of iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>Let the dread of the God of Heaven re&s;t upon you. My friends, it is another thing to make a profe&s;&s;ion of the Lord God of Heaven and earth, than mo&s;t are aware of; <HI>let every one that names the name of Chri&s;t, depart from ini|quity.</HI> What is iniquity? It is all things that men or women do to gratify their own wills contrary to the will of God; that is iniquity: Where had all men liberty? Where had <HI>Adam</HI> and his &s;ons their liberty to fulfil their own wills, and to contradict the will of God? Yet nothing is more common in nations, countries and families, than for people to a&s;&s;ume a liberty to perform and fulfil their own wills, and to bring about their own intere&s;t, de&s;igns and contrivances, though at the &s;ame time they are convinced that it is contrary to the will of God. Where this liberty is taken, there iniquity is wrought; that is iniquity that is unju&s;t, that which is committed again&s;t him upon whom we have all our dependence every moment for life and breath, for food and raiment, and every thing we enjoy; we have a dependence upon that God that made us, yet vain men and women a&s;&s;ume a liberty of gratifying their own wills, and &s;etting up for the fle&s;h.</P>
<P>You may remember that pa&s;&s;age of the good apo&s;tle, when he &s;aw &s;ome libertine profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity, grow loo&s;e and carele&s;s; they thought it was well they did acknowledge God in their meetings and wor&s;hip, but as to the affairs of the world, they had forgotten that God was concerned in tho&s;e things; tne apo&s;tle takes notice of &s;uch libertine loo&s;ne&s;s, <HI>go to now, you that &s;ay, to-day or to-mor|row we will go into &s;uch a city, and continue there a year, and buy and &s;ell and get gain; whereas you know not what &s;hall be on the morrow: For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little while, and then vani&s;heth away: For that you ought to &s;ay, if the Lord will, we &s;hall live and do this or that.</HI> You ought to live in &s;ubjection to him that made you, you ought to have regard to God's honour in what&s;oever you do: <HI>Whether you eat or drink, or what&s;oever you do, do all to the glory of God.</HI> Is
<PB N="89" REF="020309_0089_0FAEF6A52A9542A8">
not this &s;cripture? Is not this found among&s;t the apo&s;tle's writings? Do not we hold the name of Chri&s;tians which was given to them at <HI>Antioch?</HI> Yea, we are called Chri&s;tians, and the&s;e writings of the apo&s;tle are holy writings, and what then is the matter that we take &s;o little notice of them? That men do not apply the&s;e whole&s;ome exhortations to the particularities of their conver&s;ation, but that they go from country to country, and from one place to another, and do what they plea&s;e, without having any regard to give their &s;ubjection to the great God: This loo&s;ene&s;s hath brought into the minds of &s;ome, &s;uch a liberty, that they live without God in the world; when they go &s;ometimes to religious meetings, and when they hear the name of God mentioned, it may be there is a little awe upon their minds, and they have &s;ome regard to that God that gave them breath and being, for the pre&s;ent: But if there be not re|ligion, if there be not a tie (religion &s;ignifies a tie, a being bound to God) if men be not bound and tied to God, by that which is made known to them, every one will de&s;ire that <HI>which is good in their own eyes.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore it is nece&s;&s;ary for you, my friends, above all people, you that are come to a mea&s;ure of the mini|&s;tration of the Spirit, to know and to mind what it doth &s;peak. Such a thing I did this morning, and I am re|proved for it; &s;uch a thing I did well, and I am ju&s;tified and warranted in the doing of it: Thus it is when a thing is well or ill done. Sometimes &s;ome men act two or three days together, and never bring their actions to the rule; that is, like a man that is building and never minds his rule, &s;o what he builds up, tumbles down again upon his head. You know there is &s;omething in you that hath a &s;peaking voice, an infallible voice, and gives judgment on your actions, and pa&s;&s;eth a &s;entence, either of ju&s;tification or condemnation upon you. If you would live &s;o as to an&s;wer God in what you do, you need not fear an&s;wering men. I do not fear an&s;wering men in all I do or &s;peak; if I do but an&s;wer mine own con&s;cience, I fear no man, tho' he be of another per&s;ua&s;ion and judgment oppo&s;ite to me; if I keep peace in mine own con&s;cience, I &s;hall an|&s;wer the principle of truth in my adver&s;aries con&s;ciences,

tho' they hate me, and de&s;pi&s;e me, and &s;eek occa&s;ion again&s;t me; if my actions an&s;wer the truth of God in mine own heart, they will an&s;wer the truth in any man's heart: This makes a man as bold as a lion.</P>
<P>When the people of God obtain a reputation, to be true and ju&s;t, and holy and righteous, all men will expect ho|line&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s at their hands. What if I pro|fe&s;s to be one of the&s;e people? If I have not the truth in my own heart, tho' I put on this reputation as a cloak to hide my in&s;incerity, the want of that truth takes away my courage. It is truth that hath a power in all men in the world, and it is the power of holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s that makes wicked men afraid; and therefore the apo&s;tle argues upon that &s;ubject, the magi&s;trate is cloathed with power. What power hath he? The power of ju&s;|tice, and the power of the &s;word. What &s;word hath he? A &s;word of ju&s;tice; and he is a <HI>terror to evil-doers, but a prai&s;e to them that do well.</HI> It is true, if I have done evil, if I meet with a man that is but my equal; if in buying, and &s;elling, and commerce, I have wronged him, and deceived him, tho' he knows not of it, yet I am afraid of him, I am fearful that he will di&s;cover me and find me out: But if I &s;peak the truth, and do that which is hone&s;t in the &s;ight of all men, I &s;hall not fear any man: There is no nation under Heaven, but there is a principle of truth to be found among them in the hearts of men. If I act according to the principle of truth in mine own heart, there is the &s;ame principle of truth in all men. If I walk up to the principle of truth in my&s;elf, I &s;hall like|wi&s;e walk up to the principle of truth in all men's hearts; if mine own heart doth not condemn me, all the world cannot condemn me.</P>
<P>If profe&s;&s;ors were re&s;olved to an&s;wer the principles of truth in their own hearts, and go thorough-&s;titch in their profe&s;&s;ion, they might live courageou&s;ly: Truth will crown them with victory. But if they do not live according to the rule and &s;tandard of truth, they are like &s;alt that hath <HI>lo&s;t its &s;avour, which is trodden under the feet of men.</HI> But where all are one in truth, they are gathered into the truth, and they will live according to it, &s;o far as they
<PB N="91" REF="020309_0091_0FAEF6A7104D3F90">
are convinced of it. If you would give them a world, they will not give away a hair's breadth of the truth which they have profe&s;&s;ed. When truth thus comes to have dominion, then truth &s;hall over&s;pread the earth, and the <HI>kingdoms of the world &s;hall become the kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Chri&s;t,</HI> and righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall rule, and the &s;ceptre of it be &s;wayed over the nations, and they that rebel again&s;t it, &s;hall be broken by it, and they that are found in it, &s;hall have dominion, and they &s;hall condemn hypocrites and di&s;&s;emblers. Now if you would grow up in this do|minion, you have an opportunity for it, becau&s;e the truth is revealed in your own hearts.</P>
<P>They who undertake to walk in the truth, meerly from what they hear the mini&s;ters of truth preach, laying up in their minds a company of doctrines, notions and tenets, they will &s;tumble and fall; but they that will hearken to the truth in their own hearts, and regard the voice of it in all their ways and undertakings; the&s;e have a mini&s;ter at home with them, they have a chaplain in their own hou&s;es; if there be any thing they know not, and if they know not what to do, they ask the mini&s;ter of the &s;anctuary; others will ask their mini&s;ters, but your mini&s;ter is at home with you: Where hath God appointed any man to rule over your con&s;cience? No, God hath appointed Chri&s;t only to rule and govern your con&s;cience, to be <HI>the author of faith, and the fini&s;her of it</HI> too: You that are come to the di&s;pen&s;a|tion of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, keep to the te&s;timony in your own hearts; then you have fellow&s;hip with one another in the truth; and you have cau&s;e to ble&s;s God for it, that God hath &s;o opened the hearts of one toward another, that the &s;uffering of one, is the &s;uffering of all; and the con&s;olation of one, the comfort and rejoicing of all: But alas! who is in this fellow&s;hip? Only tho&s;e that are in fellow&s;hip with the truth, in their own hearts, and really &s;o: If a man &s;hall break fellow&s;hip with truth in his own heart, he will make no bones of breaking fellow&s;hip with his brethren: As &s;oon as men break fellow&s;hip with truth, they are unruly, heady, trouble&s;ome, and make no matter of &s;plitting and tearing, and rending of fellow&s;hip with others. How comes it to pa&s;s that thou ha&s;t done this? Thou did&s;t not thus while
<PB N="92" REF="020309_0092_0FAEF6A7E5600228">
thou feared&s;t &s;inning again&s;t the witne&s;s of God in thine own heart. But when men have once made light of the great mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel in their own hearts, it is an ea&s;y mat|ter to make light of the re&s;t; if, as Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>they have done &s;o to the green tree, no wonder that they do &s;o to the dry tree: If they de&s;pi&s;e me</HI> (&s;aith Chri&s;t) <HI>do you think they will love you?</HI></P>
<P>It is mo&s;t evident in a great many at this day, they di&s;pute again&s;t truth, they have taken a liberty to &s;peak contrary to the truth in their own hearts, and then they cry down the mini&s;ters of it: Do you think they do &s;o that keep their fir&s;t tenderne&s;s? When they were convinced, the power of the Lord re&s;ted upon them; when the power of the Lord fir&s;t wrought upon you, and brought you to yea and nay, and to plain &s;imple language and habit, this was with joy and delight for Chri&s;t's &s;ake. They that keep up this tenderne&s;s and &s;implicity of mind, there is no &s;cattering, nor rending, or tearing among them, they <HI>keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,</HI> and they are kept together in one.</P>
<P>Friends, you have an opportunity in your hands, &s;ee that you make u&s;e of it; you may bear up, and not be de|ceived by men, or devils, if you keep faithful to the prin|ciple of truth in your own hearts. Let what reproach and per&s;ecution &s;oever come, here is a &s;tandard, a foundation and a rule, for you to be governed by, every hour of the day; &s;earch your hearts, and try your con&s;ciences by it. As ye do this, and keep to the rule of the new creature, of the regeneration, being changed from a carnal birth to an incor|ruptible birth. <HI>If you be born of the incorruptible feed,</HI> the devil cannot corrupt you, evil pa&s;&s;ions cannot corrupt you; if you keep up that foundation that is incorruptible in it&s;elf, then nothing will corrupt you, nor your ways and manners: If you will live according to the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel, you will &s;erve God, and be examples to others in the life of holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and hereby God &s;hall be glorified. This is that which will &s;hine forth to the whole nation, and give a good report to truth: But if any that profe&s;s the truth, be found fal&s;e to their profe&s;&s;ion, and be found unholy, and deceive and over-reach their neigh|bour, they lo&s;e by it, and the devil rejoiceth at it.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="020309_0093_0FAEF6A8979DA780">Thus we know the life of righteou&s;ne&s;s is brought forth through the Spirit of truth, and out-&s;hines all, and will reach God's witne&s;s in them that are afar off, and bring them near; and happy and ble&s;&s;ed are they that are found in this divine work, conforming their lives and conver&s;ations according to the new creature, peace be upon them, <HI>and upon the whole I&s;rael of God.</HI> There is a mini&s;ter that abides with you, that goes home with you, it is his te&s;ti|mony that you mu&s;t &s;tand or fall by: If any one &s;hould be a fal&s;e profe&s;&s;or, and be cried up, it he be not &s;incere, he hath not peace; though he flutter awhile, and make a &s;hew, the worm of guilt gnaws and torments him; &s;uch as the&s;e have not peace with God, nor fellow&s;hip with the church: Though they &s;eem to be alive, yet they are dead; as it was with the churches in <HI>A&s;ia, they had a name to live, yet they were dead;</HI> though they have an empty name, &s;uch a one is a living man or woman, they are e&s;teemed friends to the church; but though they are commended and cried up, and have a name to live, yet they are dead; <HI>there is a few names in</HI> Sardis <HI>which have not defiled their garments, they &s;hall walk with me in white,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>for they are worthy. I know thy works, that thou ha&s;t a name that thou live&s;t, and art dead.</HI> See what Chri&s;t, the bright Morning-Star, could do: He could look into a meeting, and &s;ee whether few or many had only a name to live, or were really alive; if they were dead as to &s;incerity and truth, though they had been among the church, they would help to break it down, but not to build it up.</P>
<P>You that have this divine life &s;till &s;tirring in you, and feel the operation that fir&s;t quickened you to God, prize this principle of the divine life above all: What is there can rob you of it? Value not the friend&s;hip of the world: Alas! what can it amount to? Count it as <HI>dung in compari&s;on of Chri&s;t Je&s;us;</HI> look upon all things with a &s;ound eye: Peace with God is of that concernment, that you cannot be happy here or hereafter, without it; the friend&s;hip of the world I can be without, and the cu&s;toms and fa&s;hions of the world I can be without, I can &s;pare the&s;e things; but the favour of God I cannot be without, <HI>and growth in grace and the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and

a &s;incere profe&s;&s;ion of the go&s;pel; I cannot be without the&s;e things.</P>
<P>My friends, though you do not make a &s;hew and flutter in the world, as &s;ome others do, yet your glory is within; they that are living members of this divine body, the glory, and beauty and brightne&s;s of &s;uch, appears in the &s;ight of God. If you grow in <HI>grace,</HI> you will be a comfort to one another; and as the apo&s;tle &s;peaks, <HI>you are our epi&s;tle writ|ten in our hearts, known and read of all men.</HI> The Lord pre&s;erve and keep you &s;imple, keep you in all &s;incerity, in that truth that hath wrought in your own hearts, that you may have acquaintance with your teacher, that he may not be driven into corners; for you may do it, and &s;top his mouth, and &s;ilence him too. If you let your per|ver&s;e will rule, you may &s;lay the ju&s;t; but there will come a day of his ri&s;ing, then down you go. What&s;oever men may get by it at pre&s;ent, when truth ri&s;eth, when the Ju&s;t One that was &s;lain hath a re&s;urrection in them, then mo&s;t certain down they go. While you have an oppor|tunity in your hands, and an intere&s;t in the covenant of life, walk with God according to the coun&s;el and dic|tates of his Holy Spirit, that you may be brought to a heavenly fellow&s;hip, and to partake of the good things that God hath prepared for his children.</P>
<P>My friends, pray prize your &s;ea&s;ons, let no day &s;lip, for fear you mi&s;s a day at la&s;t; wait upon the Lord, and let his fear and a holy awe be always upon your hearts: Then peace will be upon you, and there will be accep|tance of all that you do. <HI>Mark the perfect man, and be|hold the upright, for the end of that man is peace;</HI> when he can reflect upon his pa&s;t life, and &s;ay, I have walked before the Lord with a perfect heart, and done that which is good and well plea&s;ing in his &s;ight, and have not turned a&s;ide to the right hand or to the left, but the Standard of Truth hath been the guide of all my <HI>&s;piritual</HI> and <HI>tempo|ral</HI> actions.

<P>EVERLASTING, glorious, eternal God of Life! who&s;e kingdom ruleth over all; thy kingdom is an ever|la&s;ting kingdom; a glorious, ble&s;&s;ed day hath dawned, where|in thou art making thy&s;elf known to the &s;ons and daughters of men; and thou ha&s;t opened an eye in a remnant (which the God of this world had blinded) to &s;ee the glory of this day. For tho' we have lived without God in the world, yet thou art near to us, and thou ha&s;t called us to repentance, and in&s;pired our &s;ouls with a de&s;ire to thee, and to the remembrance of thy name: Prai&s;e and everla&s;ting thank&s;givings belong unto thee, who art the author of our &s;alvation; who ha&s;t reached out thy hand and laid hold upon us, and &s;ought us out when we &s;ought thee not, and ha&s;t made known thy power and love for our redemp|tion and &s;alvation; and thou wilt make it known more and more to every upright, &s;incere mind.</P>
<P>O powerful Father of Life! how hath thy power and goodne&s;s been revealed on our behalf for thine own name's &s;ake?

<HEAD>SERMON VIII. SAVING FAITH, <HI>the</HI> GIFT <HI>of</HI> GOD <HI>alone.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Preached at GRACE-CHURCH-STREET, <DATE>March 8, 1687.</DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU that are made partakers of that precious faith, which hath brought you to an expectation of that redemption and deliverance that comes alone by Chri&s;t Je&s;us, your minds &s;hould be continually exerci&s;ed in that faith which God hath given you, for it is a great gift, a ble&s;&s;ed gift that he hath given to us to believe. This never came of our&s;elves, never was there a true believer in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, but he received his faith of God, it was the gift of God, it was given to him to believe. Other &s;orts of believ|ers there are in the world, that can communicate their faith one to another; but they are true believers that have their faith communicated to them by the Spirit of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, it is <HI>given to them that believe;</HI> and becau&s;e it is &s;o excellent and &s;o heavenly a gift, and hath &s;uch large privileges be|longing to it, it is nece&s;&s;ary that every one that receives it, &s;hould have a continual exerci&s;e in it; that you may know what it is, and what it doth for you, and &s;o come to be experienced Chri&s;tians. Now all that are partakers of it, they do believe, and know in whom they have believed, and for what they have believed, even for the &s;aving of their &s;ouls.</P>
<P>The true faith, that is the gift of God, it is not at all
<PB N="97" REF="020309_0097_0FAEF6AB89965C68">
&s;hort of a complete &s;aving of their &s;ouls; they that truly believe, their faith &s;tands in one that they know is able to &s;ave to the utmo&s;t; and &s;o a true believer hath a great com|fort in his faith above all other believers in the world; for he knows that his faith reaches to a complete redemption, unto a complete &s;anctification, unto a complete fitting of him for the kingdom of God.</P>
<P>Now there is no &s;uch faith that ever was made by men, there is no &s;uch faith that all the wi&s;e and learned men upon the face of the earth, have either preached or given forth to be received; for if you come to con&s;ider the divers forms of faith that men have mini&s;tered, they will fall &s;hort of &s;aving their &s;ouls, they fall &s;hort of redemption, they fall &s;hort of fitting and preparing them for the kingdom of God, and &s;o they have not that comfort, that &s;atisfaction, and that inward refre&s;hment that belongs to the others, or that ac|crues to their &s;ouls, that have <HI>the faith of God's elect.</HI></P>
<P>And herein hath been the privilege of the people of God in all ages, as well as in our age; their faith hath had a farther extent, it hath reached farther in order to the good of their &s;ouls, than the faith of all others hath done: What comfort can a &s;erious Chri&s;tian take in a faith that falls &s;hort of righteou&s;ne&s;s and redemption? Would it not make a man or woman's heart ach, to think I am a believer, but yet I have no faith that reacheth to &s;anctification, and holy living, and redemption from &s;in? All my faith leaves me a &s;inner all my days; to my dy|ing hour there is no ma&s;tery to be had, no getting vic|tory over &s;in, it will prevail over me as long as I live.</P>
<P>This is not that <HI>precious faith</HI> that God's elect have been made partakers of, that works effectually in their &s;ouls; this is not that faith that can mini&s;ter real comfort to the poor &s;oul that is laden with iniquity, and weary of &s;in; the faith that falls &s;hort of &s;anctification, and redemption from &s;in, is &s;uch a faith as God never gave his people; it came &s;ome other way into the world, and it hath cap|tivated mo&s;t of the &s;ons and daughters of men, and they have expelled the true faith (as much as in them lies) that &s;aving faith that purifies and clean&s;es men from &s;in, and gives them victory over the world, and have got another
<PB N="98" REF="020309_0098_0FAEF6ADE3F4A6A0">
faith in the room of it; and they live in their &s;ins, and in their lu&s;ts and concupi&s;cence, and &s;till remain in cap|tivity.</P>
<P>But God was plea&s;ed to hear and an&s;wer the cry of the &s;ouls of a remnant (for which many of us have cau&s;e to magnify the name of our God) when we had travelled from mountain to hill, to &s;eek where true comfort might be found, where one &s;hould &s;ay to us that we &s;hould over|come. We know there is no eating of the tree of life until we do overcome; nor entering into God's kingdom till we be clean&s;ed. Some laid an impo&s;&s;ibility in our way, which made many a one to mourn. What, mu&s;t we never be clean&s;ed? Mu&s;t this crooked heart, and perver&s;e will, always remain? Mu&s;t I be a &s;inner and a believer? A &s;inner, and call my&s;elf a child of God? How can the&s;e things hang together? The&s;e have made many to faint in their minds, and to &s;ay as <HI>David</HI> did in his di&s;tre&s;s, <HI>one day I &s;hall peri&s;h by the hand of Saul.</HI> One day this corruption will be my ruin; for all my prayers, and hear|ing, and other duties and performances, this &s;in will be my utter ruin at la&s;t.</P>
<P>After many have mourned, and been afflicted, by rea|&s;on of the burden that was upon them, it hath plea&s;ed the Lord to vi&s;it a remnant, and to open their hearts to make known the <HI>precious faith,</HI> the <HI>faith of God's elect,</HI> the <HI>faith that was once delivered to the &s;aints.</HI> Is this the faith that is worthy of an earne&s;t contending for, and preaching for, and &s;uffering for? Who was ever &s;o mad, as to &s;uffer for &s;uch a faith as will leave a man under the power of &s;a|tan, and his own lu&s;ts? No wonder that &s;uch have a faith that is not worth contending and &s;uffering for. Who will expo&s;e them&s;elves for &s;uch a faith that will never do them a kindne&s;s? Now that faith which belongs to a purified &s;oul, to one that is &s;anctified, that faith delivered to the &s;aints, it is called a <HI>&s;hield;</HI> when once a Chri&s;tian comes to make u&s;e of this faith as a &s;hield, he will find the power of it. A &s;hield is that which is worn by per&s;ons that are among enemies; it is for the defence and &s;afe|guard of one that is be&s;et with enemies; and a good Chri&s;tian is &s;o &s;ituated.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="020309_0099_0FAEF6B0952EF170">There is a &s;ort of blind Chri&s;tians, friends to the world, their chri&s;tianity is worldly, and their faith worldly; but all true Chri&s;tians are in the mid&s;t of their enemies, in|ward and outward; and if they had not the &s;hield of faith to defend them, they would certainly be wounded every day, they would be &s;lain and lo&s;e their lives: The faith that is called a &s;hield, it is that by which a Chri&s;tian is to be defended and &s;aved from harm de&s;igned again&s;t him every hour; <HI>for the devil goes about like a roaring lion, continually &s;eeking whom he may devour.</HI> The apo&s;tle &s;peaks more particularly to believers; <HI>the devil, your adver|&s;ary,</HI> he is an adver&s;ary in him&s;elf, but more e&s;pecially <HI>your adver&s;ary</HI> that are believers; that have believed to the &s;aving of your &s;ouls. You that believe that Chri&s;t is &s;ent of God, endued with power &s;ufficient to break his head, and power to redeem you out of his &s;ervice and bondage, the devil will be your adver&s;ary: Let him be &s;o, if I have but my &s;hield. This is that which if a man u&s;e, he will <HI>quench all the fiery darts of the devil.</HI></P>
<P>If a man come once to receive the faith, the true faith, faith in the power of God, this faith will remain victo|rious over temptation; but if thou do&s;t not keep thy faith in a continual exerci&s;e, thou do&s;t not de&s;erve the name of a true believer: If a man receive the true faith, and grow carele&s;s in his chri&s;tian exerci&s;e, will not this adver&s;ary, the devil, be about his ears? Will not he &s;end forth his fiery darts at him; his temptations, and &s;nares, and gins, to entangle him, tho' he be a believer, if he doth not keep in the continual exerci&s;e of his faith? But a true Chri&s;tian, that feels the power of the grace of God, and is in the continual exerci&s;e of true faith, he is like a watch|man or &s;entinel, that hath his armour on, and his &s;hield ready, he knows he is on the borders of his enemies quar|ters, and he keeps him&s;elf in perpetual watchfulne&s;s, in daily expectation of the devil's fiery darts; he keeps his &s;hield in readine&s;s; I &s;ee a temptation lies in &s;uch a thing, but I &s;ee the Lord's power is able to keep me out of it. I &s;ee there is profit or plea&s;ure in the &s;nare; it is a hook that is baited, but I &s;ee the hook through the bait, ble&s;&s;ed be God; and I have a confidence in his
<PB N="100" REF="020309_0100_0FAEF920594F8DA0">

<P>A believer keeps in the exerci&s;e of his faith, and con|&s;iders that <HI>his &s;alvation is nearer than when he fir&s;t believed;</HI> the people that believe, are not pre&s;ently &s;aved, the work of &s;alvation is to be wrought after they believe; <HI>for without faith, it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God, neverthele&s;s the foun|dation of God &s;tandeth &s;ure,</HI> it is founded upon the power of God; when a man believeth, the work is begun; tho' &s;ome fooli&s;h profe&s;&s;ors tell us, that the work is done when the act is only in the mind; they will tell you what day of the month, and &s;uch a day of the year their conver&s;ion was wrought; but they know not what they &s;ay. A man may po&s;&s;ibly know when it was brought about: A man may know about the time when God communicated faith to him; but he mu&s;t know after he is a believer, then begins the work of &s;alvation, the believer is to be &s;aved from this or the other enemy; he is not pre&s;ently &s;aved from all, there mu&s;t be a warfare, <HI>a fighting the good fight of faith,</HI> before the&s;e enemies of his &s;alvation are overcome; the devil will not give over becau&s;e I am a believer, and becau&s;e Chri&s;t promi&s;ed to <HI>break his head; the &s;eed of the woman &s;hall break the &s;erpent's head.</HI> I am now but put|ting on my armour; the battle is not fought; I have not yet gone through the peril of the fight; I am now buckling on my armour; when the fight comes, if I have not my &s;hield and my armour ready, I may be &s;lain for all this; &s;ome <HI>have made &s;hipwreck of faith,</HI> they have not held it, nor kept the faith, but given it away: But &s;aith the apo&s;|tle, <HI>I have fought the good fight, I have kept the faith,</HI> I have gotten the victory.</P>
<P>So people, after they are believers, they mu&s;t wait to have their faith &s;trengthened by renewed manife&s;tations of the &s;ame power in which it fir&s;t &s;tood: They mu&s;t wait upon the Lord, and he will renew the &s;trength of their faith, zeal and courage; and as temptations are renewed, they have new courage, and new &s;trength and new ability, and all by this divine, &s;piritual and Chri&s;tian exerci&s;e; they every day come to &s;ee the work they believed, that which their faith tended to, &s;ee the work in &s;ome mea&s;ure wrought, they
<PB N="101" REF="020309_0101_0FAEF920D61AC488">
&s;ee &s;ome enemy of their &s;ouls brought down and &s;lain, and they &s;ee their &s;ouls come up to a little more dominion than they had before; they &s;ee the devil's power is weakened more than before, and that he hath not &s;o much power as he hath had over them. The&s;e things are &s;ome encourage|ment to rai&s;e up in a true Chri&s;tian, living prai&s;es to God; &s;eeing, by believing, he hath found thus much encourage|ment by the working of the word, why &s;hould he not wait on the Lord for the accompli&s;hment of this work, that he may believe to the &s;aving of his &s;oul, that he may come to receive the end of his hope and faith, the &s;alvation of his &s;oul? Now, by thus keeping their faith in exerci&s;e, they know that their <HI>&s;alvation is nearer now, than when they fir&s;t believed.</HI> It is not &s;o with every one, for many that have believed, their &s;alvation is farthe&s;t off, becau&s;e of their negligence, profe&s;&s;ing one thing with their mouths, and doing another thing in their practice; there are &s;ome things which they believe and profe&s;s, and yet do the contrary; that puts their &s;alvation further off, and draws them &s;e|cretly into de&s;ponding, and into a lo&s;ing their courage and zeal for God; the cu&s;tom of &s;inning hath at la&s;t taken away the &s;en&s;e of &s;inning. It is &s;o with a man when he fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;eth the rule, he is &s;omewhat tender, and doth it with &s;ome regret; but after he is come to a cu&s;tom of doing it, he is pretty well at ea&s;e, and &s;o by degrees he goes on towards the &s;tate of being pa&s;t feeling. At la&s;t &s;uch &s;inners come to dying; they were dead once before, and <HI>were quickened through the operation of the Spirit of Chri&s;t Je&s;us;</HI> they were quickened, and if they &s;hall die again, if you die a &s;econd time, pray remember it is a &s;econd time; you that are carele&s;s and ready to die, remember it is the &s;econd death that you are going to; and con&s;ider that if you <HI>die the &s;econd death, you &s;hall have no part of the fir&s;t re&s;urrection:</HI> Better &s;uch had never been born at all, than after they have lived in hope, to lo&s;e it again. This is that which was upon my heart to commend unto you, that you may partake of this <HI>precious faith,</HI> that hath a tendency to the &s;aving of the &s;oul, and fitting you for the kingdom of God. Hath God given you to believe? And will you not believe that you &s;hall live without &s;in?
<PB N="102" REF="020309_0102_0FAEF921998470B0">
If you come to obtain this precious faith, you will be|lieve that you &s;hall come to live without &s;inning again&s;t God, and have the light of his countenance &s;hining upon you. He that truly believeth, his faith reacheth to this, and he will &s;ay to him&s;elf, I am &s;aved a little from the liberty of my tongue, and from many &s;ins of an evil prac|tice: God hath redeemed me from my vanity, pride and pa&s;&s;ion, and other things that were trouble&s;ome, the Lord hath redeemed me from them; I &s;ee the work is going on, and I am nearer to the kingdom of God than when I fir&s;t believed; I have gotten victory over many of my &s;piritual enemies, and I hope the Lord will carry me on, and keep me by his power through faith unto &s;alvation: Hitherto the Lord hath helped me, I have not fought in vain, I have not been beating the air, but God hath given me victory over the tempter inwardly and outwardly, &s;o that he could not prevail, whil&s;t I kept the &s;hield of faith over my head; but when I have been carele&s;s, and not exerci&s;ed my faith as a &s;hield, I have been weak as other men.</P>
<P>You are not called to weakne&s;s and feeblene&s;s, but to the power of God, that you may be exerci&s;ed in it, and by it be kept from the evil of the world: There is a po&s;&s;ibility of being kept, if you be faithful to him that hath called you, that is, <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Captain of our Salvation,</HI> if you follow him &s;tep by &s;tep, and do not run headlong all at once; when you &s;ee a great deal of &s;in and corruption before you, and &s;eek to ma&s;ter it in your own &s;trength, you will lo&s;e the victory: The &s;ame word that &s;heweth us our &s;in, &s;heweth us our own ina|bility to overcome it, and that we can do nothing with|out divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance; tho' we lie long &s;truggling under the weight and burden of &s;in, we cannot of our&s;elves get vic|tory over it, we cannot bring judgment into victory, God mu&s;t have the glory of it. If you keep to Je&s;us, he will carry on the work; you did believe in him, for he did work this faith in you, and he will carry on his own work, and his own work &s;hall prai&s;e him. All others that talk of faith, and make an empty profe&s;&s;ion, they di&s;ho|nour God; they talk of perfection, and living without &s;in,
<PB N="103" REF="020309_0103_0FAEF924A34F5E20">
but never experience it, and &s;o bring di&s;honour to God: If you wait to &s;ee this work carried on; if you believe and exerci&s;e your faith for the overcoming of your &s;ins, and <HI>perfecting holine&s;s in the fear of God,</HI> you will hereby bring glory to God, who alone is worthy of all prai&s;e; who is God over all, ble&s;&s;ed for ever more. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<P>Everla&s;ting Father! thy mercy is great, and thy good|ne&s;s is great, and to be greatly prized by us all; thou had&s;t compa&s;&s;ion on us to help us when we could not help our&s;elves; and thou ha&s;t laid help upon one that is mighty and able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t all that come unto thee by him.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON IX. TRUTH'S TESTIMONY AGAINST THE POWER <HI>of</HI> SIN <HI>and</HI> SATAN.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Preached at GRACE-CHURCH-STREET, <DATE>June 3, 1688.</DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>GOD hath made you witne&s;&s;es of the great work of this day; the Lord I &s;ay hath given you eyes to &s;ee, and ears to hear, and hearts to under&s;tand the great work of the day; he hath called you forth, that you may be faithful witne&s;&s;es every one in your mea&s;ure of that which he hath brought to pa&s;s in your &s;ight, for he hath revealed his power, the eternal power by which the world was made, he hath revealed and manife&s;ted that power for the rai&s;ing up of life, for the &s;ubjecting and bringing under death, and the power of it; for a great while a te&s;timony that hath been born in the nation hath been unto death; he that hath the power of death,
<PB N="105" REF="020309_0105_0FAEF927521063C0">
that is, the devil, he hath had a great many to &s;ound out his power, to declare the continuance of it, that death mu&s;t reign, and darkne&s;s mu&s;t continue, and that the kingdom of the man of &s;in will never be brought down.</P>
<P>But now in our day, glory to God on high, here is another &s;ound come forth, the Lord <HI>Jehovah</HI> hath uttered his voice, and who can but prophecy! The word of pro|phecy is given of God, and many are rai&s;ed up to pub|li&s;h it, and to &s;ound forth the name of the Lord in the extirpation, the ruin and de&s;truction, that is and &s;hall be brought upon the kingdom of iniquity, upon the kingdom of the man of &s;in, and to prophecy and declare in the name of the Lord, that righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall run down like a &s;tream; this is the go&s;pel, the glad tidings that we receive from God, and mini&s;ter unto you, that you might believe, and that be|lieving you might come to wait upon the Lord, and behold the accompli&s;hment of it.</P>
<P>For, my friends, herein hath con&s;i&s;ted all the labour, travel and exerci&s;e, of the &s;ervants of the Lord; and for this cau&s;e have we &s;uffered many things, and gone through many trials, <HI>becau&s;e we have &s;tedfa&s;tly believed, and therefore have we &s;poken it;</HI> that the Lord will, by his Almighty power, lay wa&s;te, de&s;troy and bring to an end, that power, that the wicked one, the devil, hath had upon the minds and &s;pirits of the &s;ons and daughters of men, and that he will &s;et up and e&s;tabli&s;h, in the very &s;ame &s;oul, a law of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and a law of truth, and will cau&s;e the beauty of holine&s;s to &s;hine forth through them, where iniquity hath lodged, where the wicked one hath ruled.</P>
<P>Now you that have believed this te&s;timony, you have received it, as glad tidings unto you, for you are weary of that old &s;ervice, you are oppre&s;&s;ed under the power of that &s;trange prince. There was a kind of &s;pirit and power that had ruled over you, that neither gave you life nor breath, nor had done any good thing, and yet you were &s;ubject; and many there were, who through the grace of God, came to &s;ee that a &s;tate and condition of &s;in and iniquity was not a happy &s;tate; and by a &s;ecret kindling of the <HI>&s;park</HI> of God's love in your &s;ouls ere you knew him, there was a cry rai&s;ed to be delivered, if it be po&s;&s;ible. If
<PB N="106" REF="020309_0106_0FAEF9279D435540">
there be any deliverance, O why may not I be delivered! If there be any redemption, why may not I be redeemed! If there be a power that can &s;et me free from the &s;ervice of this wicked one, why may not I be &s;et free?</P>
<P>Ah, friends! remember the days and nights in which the&s;e living cries run through you, then you were poor in|deed; then you were humble and broken, and the Lord beheld you in tho&s;e days, he &s;aw your &s;tate and condition, he &s;aw how helple&s;s you were, and did not he ari&s;e to help you? Did not a power &s;pring forth in the day of your humility, in the day of tenderne&s;s, by which you became able to make war again&s;t the lu&s;ts of your own hearts, and did not you overcome and prevail in your war? Did not you make a progre&s;s by the power and by the grace that fir&s;t rai&s;ed de&s;ires in you? And as you made this progre&s;s and gained ground, as I may &s;ay, of your own corruptions, your faith came to be &s;trengthened, and you were confirmed in the belief and in the obedience of the truth; and the more you tru&s;ted and relied upon him, the more did he manife&s;t his power in you; he made known his ability and his &s;trength in your weakne&s;s, &s;o that you did become <HI>living witne&s;&s;es,</HI> every one in your mea&s;ure, that there was &s;uch a power; and that that power was able not only to &s;ave from a little, or from a few, but was able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t, to &s;ave out of all that was polluted and defiled, and to clean&s;e and purify the con&s;cience from all dead works, and to enable you to &s;erve the living God.</P>
<P>Now the Lord having thus e&s;tabli&s;hed you, and confirmed you by his power, that you were found in the <HI>faith,</HI> and firm in the believing of the <HI>truth,</HI> my friends, all the labour, and travel and doctrine, and exerci&s;e of the preachers of the go&s;pel, to tho&s;e who were converted and confirmed, be|came very acceptable. So we preach, and &s;o you believed; here was a unity in our faith, here grew up a fellow&s;hip, a communion in the faith, and the Lord became glorified in the a&s;&s;emblies not only of tho&s;e that preached, but of tho&s;e that heard, becau&s;e each one had a place in the body, and each one had a &s;avour of the word of life by which the body was nouri&s;hed.</P>
<P>Now, my friends, that which lies particularly upon me
<PB N="107" REF="020309_0107_0FAEF9285532C9D0">
to leave with you for my te&s;timony (and I pray God that it may be placed in the hearts of all you that have believed) is, that you may all wait upon the Lord, to &s;ee all that brought to pa&s;s which you have believed: For I take notice by the eye that God hath opened in me, by which he hath made me to take care of his flock, and &s;ometimes put his word in my mouth, that I may &s;peak a word in due &s;ea&s;on: I &s;ay, by this eye, I take notice of many that have received this precious faith, and thereby have believed the great and high &s;tate; their faith reached &s;o far, they knew that power to be able to bring them into a perfect dominion over their lu&s;ts, and pa&s;&s;ions, and corruptions, and over the &s;pirit of the world, over pride, over anger, over all things that are op|po&s;ite to the divine life; their faith is as &s;ound as we can preach it in re&s;pect of the extent of it, but their faith hath not reached thus far in its operation upon their hearts; they have not had the power going on, to accompli&s;h and fulfil that which remains.</P>
<P>Are there not &s;ome here and there that are &s;ettled in the be|lief of the truth, but are got into an ea&s;e from the labour of the truth? But if I be &s;ound in the faith, my under|&s;tanding is opened; I do not only believe this matter, but have inward evidence and demon&s;tration, that I am certain, pa&s;t all doubt and que&s;tion of it, that the Lord reveals his power in them that believe, that purifies them, and makes them every whit clean; and here I have a fel|low&s;hip and communion with them that preach, and them that believe.</P>
<P>But, my friends, all this will not give you communion with God; though there is communion with the church of God, with re&s;pect to men, who are come into one faith and doctrine, yet for fellow&s;hip with God, it &s;tands in a life beyond all doctrines, and beyond all words and expre&s;&s;ions; therefore your bu&s;ine&s;s and mine, and every one's, is what we undertook when our faces were fir&s;t turned to God, that we may be followers of Chri&s;t in the regeneration. For many may be firm in point of doctrine, and yet may not follow Chri&s;t Je&s;us: Many hold the truth, but do not hold it in righteou&s;ne&s;s, but unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Now, my friends, have a care, your religion and your
<PB N="108" REF="020309_0108_0FAEF92911A37CD8">
&s;ouls eternal welfare are concerned. This doctrine I leave you in charge in the name of the Lord God: Flatter not your&s;elves any one of you, becau&s;e of the &s;oundne&s;s of your belief, but look for &s;oundne&s;s of heart, and for a right &s;pirit to be created in you, a &s;pirit that can no way endure any thing that the light of Chri&s;t hath made manife&s;t to be evil; if it be truth you own, then exerci&s;e faith upon it, and what&s;oever &s;in or temptation a&s;&s;aults you, &s;ay, I &s;hall overcome in the name of the Lord Jehovah; I &s;hall bring thee under, be what lu&s;t, pa&s;&s;ion, or corruption &s;oever thou wilt, in the name of the Lord, I &s;hall overcome thee, and bring thee under.</P>
<P>Travel on in the faith committed to you, and you will be more than conquerors; you will not only grow into external fellow&s;hip with the people of God in the &s;ight of men, but into fellow&s;hip with the church of the fir&s;t-born, who&s;e names are written in Heaven; and your communion will not be in words and doctrines, and principles of faith; but your communion will be with God the Father, and his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and &s;o in all your meetings together, the joy of the Lord will be your &s;trength, and the joy of his great <HI>&s;alvation</HI> your covering, and he will manife&s;t his gracious pre&s;ence with you; and that power which hath kept you to this day from your childhood, and pre&s;erved you in all your battles and conflicts with the world, and &s;trength|ened and encouraged you when you went &s;ometimes &s;or|rowing and mourning night and day, and fearing le&s;t you &s;hould not overcome your adver&s;aries; that power that hath kept you hitherto, will do greater things for you than you have yet been witne&s;&s;es of.</P>
<P>Therefore, dear friends, this I would leave with you, there is nothing will keep you and me in that little time that remains to us here to &s;pend on earth, but that which will keep us in the exerci&s;e of faith towards God, and his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is <HI>able to &s;ave us to the uttermo&s;t:</HI> Let us wait to &s;ee the power of God for <HI>&s;anctification and holine&s;s;</HI> that will reach as far as &s;aving us from our &s;ins.</P>
<P>This hath been the greate&s;t reproach that ever our ad|ver&s;aries have thrown upon us, that there are &s;ome among&s;t
<PB N="109" REF="020309_0109_0FAEF929D78B3CA8">
us that talk of believing in the power of God, and talk of an ability to overcome their &s;ins, and living a holy life, and living without &s;in, while they them&s;elves live in it. This is the greate&s;t reproach that ever our adver&s;aries have thrown upon us: Who&s;oever have been the cau&s;e of this reproach, God will require it of them, for the Lord is jealous of his name and glory; and he will have the prai&s;e and honour that is due to his great name, for <HI>work|ing in us both to will and to do of his good plea&s;ure,</HI> &s;aith the apo&s;tle; tho' I know nothing of my&s;elf, yet am I not hereby ju&s;tified. When you come to that, that you can|not charge your&s;elves, then the Lord will not charge you; but take heed that therein you place not your ju&s;tification, hereby you are not ju&s;tified.</P>
<P>Therefore have an eye to <HI>Je&s;us, the author and fini&s;her of our faith.</HI> He begins the work of faith, and he will carry it on until he be the fini&s;her of it, and the ju&s;tifier of it; he is the Mediator of the New Covenant, that alone ju&s;tifies the children of God. Depend not upon your own holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s for ju&s;tification; keep your eyes to Je&s;us the author of your faith, who will be al&s;o the fini&s;her of it; keep your hearts with all diligence, and walk humbly with God, watching le&s;t your adver&s;ary that you have overcome, prevail again&s;t you. By going from the power, there is no &s;afety for the flock, but only while they keep in the &s;hepherd's fold; be faithful and keep your&s;elves in the love of God, and he will be pre&s;ent with you, and keep you to be his witne&s;&s;es to the end of your days, and will rai&s;e up another generation to be wit|ne&s;&s;es to his power, when he hath taken you to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>To that mighty power of God I commit you, for pre|&s;erving you in humility of mind and &s;oul; and my prayer for you &s;hall be, that you may go on, and make a pro|gre&s;s in the good ways of the Lord, until his work be fini&s;hed in you.</P>

<P>O powerful God of Life! &s;hew forth thy power, that our hearts may be touched and quickened thereby, to come to fear thee, and reverence thy name, and be acquainted with thy operation in our own hearts, that they may be humbled and broken before thee, and bow down and wor&s;hip in &s;in|cerity and uprightne&s;s: That &s;o holy God of Life! if it be thy plea&s;ure, none may depart out of this a&s;&s;embly without &s;ome &s;en&s;e of thy love, and feeling of the powerful drawings of thy grace, and without being rai&s;ed up to pu|rity of heart, and convinced of the evil of every thing that is contrary to thee, and &s;erve thee in holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and pur&s;ue it with all their hearts, and minds, and &s;oul, and &s;trength, that thou maye&s;t have mercy upon them, and pardon their iniquity, and love them freely, for &s;o thou ha&s;t ordained in thy Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that we may receive re|mi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins through the belief of thy everla&s;ting truth.</P>
<P>And holy, powerful, God of Life! that all thy people may partake of holine&s;s and &s;obriety, to the prai&s;e of thy name, and that they may all come to obtain a victory over

<HEAD>SERMON X. BEARING <HI>the</HI> CROSS <HI>of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>the true</HI> MARK <HI>of a</HI> CHRISTIAN.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Preached at DEVONSHIRE-HOUSE, <DATE>October 12, 1690.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>HE that knoweth the day of the Lord, and the &s;tretch|ing forth of his arm, is quickened to feel the power that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Head of the Church; that &s;o he may be enabled, through his power, to bring forth fruit unto God. The eye of the Lord is upon you all, and he expects at the hand of every one, that they bring forth fruit unto God, that according to the aboundings of his mer|cy towards you, and of his patience and long-&s;uffering con|cerning you, there might at la&s;t be an an&s;wer in the &s;oul of every one, unto the mercy and goodne&s;s of God. They that do not know and experience this, that the long-&s;uffering and patience of God leadeth unto repentance, they know no part of Chri&s;tianity; let them make their profe&s;&s;ion ever &s;o high, and proclaim their notions ever &s;o loud, they that know not the work of repentance in their hearts, as yet, need to learn the fir&s;t principle of the Chri&s;tian religion. You know it hath been the cu&s;tom of people to learn their children principles, and they that have learned their prin|ciples, they go for Chri&s;tians, whether they repent or no; though they go on in &s;in and iniquity all their days, yet they go under the reputation of Chri&s;tians; and it is high time to examine and find out (if you can) a rea&s;on for this, that a man &s;hall be accounted a Chri&s;tian upon any other terms
<PB N="112" REF="020309_0112_0FAEF92CD84224E0">
now in this age, than the Lord Chri&s;t did preach and publi&s;h in the days of his fle&s;h; for he did ab&s;olutely deny that any man could be his di&s;ciple, without taking up a daily cro&s;s, and without &s;elf-denial: Now how &s;hould a man at this day be a Chri&s;tian, or a di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t, without taking up a daily cro&s;s, and without &s;elf-denial?</P>
<P>It may be &s;ome will tell you, that they are baptized into the Chri&s;tian faith, and have been taught, and have made a profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tian principles, and a&s;&s;ociated them&s;elves among tho&s;e that make profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t; but here is not a word of a daily cro&s;s in all this, nor of &s;elf-denial; &s;o that they would have you to under&s;tand in this, that the terms of Chri&s;tianity are changed, and that men may be Chri&s;tians without the terms of Chri&s;t, or at lea&s;t reputed &s;o.</P>
<P>And this hath been occa&s;ioned by the great apo&s;tacy that hath been brought into the church by a long night of darkne&s;s, and the revealing of Antichri&s;t. Antichri&s;t hath been di&s;covered and revealed, and hath &s;et up, in de&s;pite of Chri&s;tianity, a fal&s;e Chri&s;tianity; and there came in the terms of a man's being accepted, and being reputed a Chri&s;tian upon Antichri&s;t's terms: And if you will con|form to do thus, and &s;ay &s;o, you &s;hall be admitted into the Chri&s;tian Society. Now all the&s;e terms of Antichri&s;t, have been &s;uch things as an unregenerate man could con|form to and comply with.</P>
<P>And the opening of this door, hath let into the church abundance of hypocrites and evil-doers, who were in too unregenerate a &s;tate to conform to tho&s;e things that were required; for in the public &s;ociety of Chri&s;tians, it was not &s;aid, you mu&s;t be regenerate, and take up a daily cro&s;s, and deny your&s;elves, and walk as becometh &s;aints, and &s;o behave your&s;elves that God may be glorified, and the profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity honoured by you. Tho&s;e were the terms of old; but there are other terms of being Chri&s;tians, which are of a later date.</P>
<P>Now this apo&s;tacy hath prevailed and &s;pread over whole nations and countries, not a &s;ew, &s;o that whole kingdoms have become Chri&s;tians upon the&s;e latter terms, and God is greatly di&s;honoured among us, and Chri&s;t the Holy One mo&s;t horribly prophaned. It is not &s;o common among
<PB N="113" REF="020309_0113_0FAEF92D8FCE3808">
Heathens and infidels, to find people wronging and deceiv|ing one another, and killing and de&s;troying one another; and yet it is the practice of many that are called Chri&s;ti|ans: The&s;e are the fruits and effects of tho&s;e latter times of Chri&s;tianity. Now &s;eeing it is thus, which no mortal man can deny, I have this que&s;tion to ask, and I de&s;ire that you would &s;eriou&s;ly weigh it in your hearts and &s;ouls, both while you are together, and when you are &s;eparate one from another, whether it is not high time for all of us to return again to the fir&s;t terms of Chri&s;tianity, and to reckon no man a Chri&s;tian, let him profe&s;s what he will, &s;aving &s;uch a one as doth know and witne&s;s, that the long-&s;uffering, and patience, and goodne&s;s of God, doth lead him to repentance; and &s;aving &s;uch a one as hath &s;o much faith towards God, that for love to God he will deny him&s;elf, and take up his cro&s;s, and be a follower of Je&s;us in that way and life he lived in.</P>
<P>It is high time for all of us to return again to the terms of Chri&s;tianity, that were &s;et up by a higher authority than ever Antichri&s;t had, and before Antichri&s;t was re|vealed; for tho' it is true that Antichri&s;t hath obtained power on earth, to e&s;tabli&s;h his &s;ort of Chri&s;tianity, that is, without the cro&s;s, and a &s;ort of religion whereby they indulge them&s;elves in what&s;oever plea&s;eth their car|nal hearts, and corrupt minds; yet Antichri&s;t hath not all power, he is not Almighty; I hope neither Antichri&s;t, nor the bea&s;t, nor the dragon, nor the fal&s;e prophet, nor the whore, have all power on earth, though they have a great deal, and by that power they have e&s;tabli&s;hed laws, decrees, ca|nons, and innumerable things about religion; and &s;ome cry, this is the way you mu&s;t walk in; others cry, the way to Heaven lies here, and here you mu&s;t travel if you will come thither: Some cry, this is truth; others &s;ay, it is error: So that the world is divided; Antichri&s;t's go|vernment in the world is divided; and when <HI>the hou&s;e is divided again&s;t it&s;elf,</HI> there is hopes that it will fall at la&s;t.</P>
<P>But there is one, to whom all power in Heaven and Earth is given and committed; and his Chri&s;tians are not divided among them&s;elves, but they are of one heart, and
<PB N="114" REF="020309_0114_0FAEF93132A758A0">
of one mind; and he that hath all power in Heaven and Earth committed to him, can cru&s;h and brui&s;e that power that others have. <HI>Herod</HI> had &s;ome, and <HI>Pilate</HI> had &s;ome&punc; but &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>your power is limited, this is your hour, and the power of darkne&s;s; and thou had&s;t not had pow|er,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t to <HI>Pilate, were it not given thee from above;</HI> here is power given to the dragon, to the fal&s;e prophet&punc; and the bea&s;t, to &s;peak great things; but this power of Antichri&s;t is going away; Chri&s;t Je&s;us was &s;ent into the world in his day, to bring people back again to God, and to primitive Chri&s;tianity and obedience, and to the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> terms of &s;ociety and communion, and to a fellow&s;hip in Chri&s;t Je&s;us through the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>Now if we had &s;et up a way of religion, as other <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> have done, which is contained in &s;ome canons, articles, doctrines, and &s;uch and &s;uch commandments of men; and if men will confe&s;s the&s;e articles, and ob&s;erve the&s;e ca|nons, they &s;hall be of our &s;ociety; then we &s;hould have done like the re&s;t of the fallen Chri&s;tians; but we have de|clared from the beginning, that profe&s;&s;ing our doctrine, and the principles of religion, doth not give any man fel|low&s;hip and communion with us; but our communion is in the &s;elf-denying life, and a daily cro&s;s, in oppo&s;ition to &s;en&s;ual lu&s;t, vanity, pride and bitterne&s;s of &s;pirit, cor|ruption, enmity and wrath; this hath brought us to a holy fellow&s;hip and communion in the Holy Gho&s;t, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> in unity from one head, which is Je&s;us Chri&s;t; &s;o that there is not this man's church, and the other man's church among the people of God.</P>
<P>Do you read in the primitive times, that <HI>Paul</HI> had his church, and <HI>Peter</HI> his church, and <HI>James</HI> his church, and <HI>Jude</HI> his church? Indeed they had their meetings as we have now, in many cities and countries among the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles;</HI> but the&s;e holy apo&s;tles that were the fir&s;t publi&s;hers of the everla&s;ting go&s;pel, after their great Lord and Ma&s;ter, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they never did appropriate any church to them&s;elves, that was not their bu&s;ine&s;s; but our work and bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;aith the apo&s;tle, is to gather you to Chri&s;t, and <HI>pre&s;ent you as a cha&s;te virgin to Chri&s;t;</HI> our work is, to <HI>turn you from darkne&s;s to light,</HI> that you may
<PB N="115" REF="020309_0115_0FAEF93158A449E0">
walk in it, and be the children of it; our work is, to <HI>build you up as a &s;piritual hou&s;e, to be pre&s;ented to Chri&s;t the</HI> Mediator.</P>
<P>This is primitive Chri&s;tianity that hath its foundation in holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;incerity and truth, not in words, and terms, and articles, and canons, and decrees, and other ob&s;ervances; this is not the foundation of true Chri&s;tianity, nor will it ever be, the devil's kingdom mu&s;t be de&s;troyed, it is &s;haking, for he in whom we believe, hath power from his Father to break the devil's head, Antichri&s;t and the dragon's head. Chri&s;t Je&s;us is &s;ignified by divers names, <HI>the &s;econd</HI> Adam, <HI>Lord from Heaven, the Way, the Truth, and the Life,</HI> but he is the &s;ame Chri&s;t; &s;o Antichri&s;t is expre&s;&s;ed by &s;everal terms and names, but he is the &s;ame power of darkne&s;s, he hath made the nations drunk, to &s;tag|ger and de&s;troy, and devour one another.</P>
<P>This hath been done in the fallen &s;tate of Chri&s;tians, and the de&s;ign which the <HI>Lord Chri&s;t</HI> hath in &s;ending his mini&s;ters and workmen to labour among you, is to re&s;tore men to the fir&s;t Chri&s;tianity, and to bring men to God; that religion is not made up of doctrines, articles, canons and decrees of men, but it hath the word of God for its foundation; <HI>he that hath an ear to hear, let him hear:</HI> There is &s;ome &s;pirit, and power, and vi&s;ible work in a true Chri&s;tian, which the fal&s;e Chri&s;tian never had. The fal&s;e Chri&s;tians have taken the name and profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, and their fruits have been di&s;honourable to him; they might as well make profe&s;&s;ion of Antichri&s;t and &s;atan, they have a form of godline&s;s, they have &s;ome of the word, but they deny the power. What is their religion and outward profe&s;&s;ion, when they want the internal life, and the motions of the Holy Spirit; if they bring forth the cur&s;ed fruits of the fle&s;h, enmity, wrath, lu&s;t and corruption, which belong to the fallen nature and unre|generate &s;tate?</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle takes notice of this deceit and hypocri&s;y in religion, which was growing up before he died; <HI>men having a form of godline&s;s, and denying the power thereof, from &s;uch turn away.</HI> If there be any brethren <HI>that walk di&s;|orderly, have no company or fellow&s;hip with them,</HI> if you would have the holy name of Je&s;us free from &s;candal.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="020309_0116_0FAEF93285CD4290">This hath been the de&s;ign of all the faithful mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, to keep their holy profe&s;&s;ion of the name of Chri&s;t free from reproach; that the holine&s;s of God's ways might be &s;een in the holy lives of the profe&s;&s;ors of them. Till men come to know this, and take up their daily cro&s;s, and exerci&s;e &s;elf-denial, their Chri&s;tianity is good for nothing; I would not have you tru&s;t in it; neither in articles, tenets, or ob&s;ervations; but &s;ee how with your lives you an&s;wer your profe&s;&s;ion: Chri&s;t was <HI>holy, harmle&s;s, undefiled, &s;epa|rate from &s;inners.</HI> And why &s;hould not Chri&s;tians be &s;o too? How can Chri&s;tians be followers of Chri&s;t, and not &s;eparate from &s;inners? Chri&s;t was &s;o. He went one way, and &s;inners went another; they followed their &s;ins and lu&s;ts, but he followed the work his heavenly father &s;ent him <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. If thou art a follower of Chri&s;t, thou art worthy of the name of a Chri&s;tian. Do drunkards and &s;wearers follow Chri&s;t? Do the wanton and proud follow him? Do the un|clean and hypocrites follow him? you know they do not&punc; why do you call them Chri&s;tians? This is a reproach and &s;hame to the holy name of Je&s;us, and to true Chri&s;tianity, that any of the&s;e folks &s;hould be called Chri&s;tians, but &s;uch as are followers of Chri&s;t, who are <HI>holy, harmle&s;s and unde|filed, and &s;eparate from &s;inners.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;eems a &s;trange kind of doctrine, yet if it had been preached in the primitive time, there were people that would have received it as apo&s;tolical doctrine, that a man &s;hould crucify the fle&s;h with the affections and lu&s;ts: For &s;aith the apo&s;tle, <HI>mortify your members which are on earth; if <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> through the &s;pirit, do mortify the deeds of the body, ye &s;halt live; but if ye live after the fle&s;h, ye &s;hall die. And to be carnally minded is death, but to be &s;piritually minded is life and peace.</HI> This was &s;ound doctrine then.</P>
<P>Now come and tell a man he &s;hall certainly peri&s;h and come to damnation for all his profe&s;&s;ion, if he does not mor|tify the deeds of the fle&s;h; if he lives in &s;in and dies in it, he is like to peri&s;h: How many have been hauled to gaols and dungeons, only for preaching this doctrine, and when we were fir&s;t &s;ent to preach, we dur&s;t not do otherwi&s;e? And God did not &s;end us to preach till he had wa&s;hed us, and &s;anctified us, and fitted us for the work of the mini&s;try.
<PB N="117" REF="020309_0117_0FAEF932D6A443C0">
Now when we &s;aw in the holy &s;criptures, that God did work upon others by his Spirit, before he &s;ent them to preach the go&s;pel, was not here &s;ufficient authority given to preach the downfal of &s;in, and de&s;truction of it? One would think that &s;uch a one, thus called and &s;ent of God, had as good authority to preach the everla&s;ting go&s;pel, as the laws enacted by all the princes of the world could give him; a man &s;ure that hath an authority for preaching the go&s;pel, would not need to wait for orders and approbation; he would not &s;tay for an induction. The apo&s;tle Paul took it for a commi&s;&s;ion that was creditable, when he tells you of his mi&s;&s;ion, <HI>it was not by man, but by the will of God,</HI> that he was called to preach the go&s;pel. If we &s;hould &s;ay we were made preachers, if you ask by whom, not any man in the world can tell you; but we were made preachers many years ago: Not by man, or by the authority of man, but by the will of God. What was your commi&s;&s;ion? to turn men from darkne&s;s (that darkne&s;s we had formerly lived in) <HI>to turn them from darkne&s;s unto light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</HI> The apo&s;tle &s;ums up his commi&s;&s;ion in a few words; the Lord told me <HI>I mu&s;t turn men from darkne&s;s to light.</HI> This is our commi&s;&s;ion that we have received from God in this age, to turn men from darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>But &s;ome will &s;ay, that we have not human learning and qualifications for the work of the mini&s;try: To this I an|&s;wer, if I heard a man &s;wear or tell a lie, I could tell him that this was not of God, I have learning enough to know, and tell men that, and &s;ay, whoring, drunkenne&s;s, and &s;wearing, and lying, were works of the fle&s;h, and fruits of the devil's power; I would have you turn from the&s;e works to the power of God. What is that power of God? I will tell you, it is a manife&s;tation of grace in your hearts, that will draw you away from the love of all the&s;e things; the grace of God, is the power of God to &s;alvation to them that believe: <HI>To as many as received Chri&s;t, to them he gave power to become the &s;ons of God; to &s;uch as believed in his name.</HI> Such Chri&s;tians will &s;hew forth the power and life of religion in their conver&s;ations: So that here is a &s;uf|ficient authority, no want of authority.</P>
<P>I have been &s;ometimes examined by what authority do

<P>Is it not high time for people that have evidences of the love of God &s;hed abroad upon their hearts by the Holy Gho&s;t, to bear their te&s;timony again&s;t &s;in and wickedne&s;s? Is it not high time for every one's mouth to be open, to te&s;tify again&s;t &s;uch a horrible mi&s;t of darkne&s;s that is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> over men; to te&s;tify again&s;t hypocri&s;y, uncleanne&s;s, and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s?</P>
<P>It was the great de&s;ign of the primitive preachers of the go&s;pel, to cry down that which &s;ome mini&s;ters cry up, &s;o that Chri&s;tianity is not like what it was, for then they told them that there was no happine&s;s but by breaking off <HI>from &s;in by repentance.</HI> No po&s;&s;ibility of &s;alvation without con|fe&s;&s;ing and for&s;aking &s;in, and tru&s;ting in the mercy of God through Chri&s;t for the pardon of it.

<P>Let me tell you, men of the greate&s;t wi&s;dom, courage and &s;trength, of the mo&s;t excellent natural parts that any man can have, are not able to grapple with their enemy the devil by their own power; there are &s;eeds of &s;in, and lu&s;t, and concupi&s;cence &s;own in all their hearts; &s;o far this is right and &s;ound doctrine, that no man can do any thing in his own power and &s;trength. But here is the mi&s;take; a man hath been a long time wre&s;tling with his &s;ins and lu&s;ts, to get the victory over them; but by woful expe|rience he finds his weakne&s;s and in&s;ufficiency; he is &s;unk in his harne&s;s, and &s;o hath given over the battle, &s;aying, I &s;hall never overcome the devil and his temptations, my &s;ins and lu&s;ts are too hard for me, I de&s;pair of ever over|coming them in my own &s;trength, by all that I can do; that is true enough, but mu&s;t thou needs peri&s;h becau&s;e thou can&s;t never overcome thy corruptions?

I am told I mu&s;t lay hold on Chri&s;t by faith, who is the Mediator between God and man, and is my only Redeemer; there is no &s;alvation in any other: This is very well; now thou art a believer, what do&s;t thou ex|pect, what do&s;t thou hope that Chri&s;t will give thee? He will not give me power over my corruptions, &s;o as to live without &s;in, that is more than I hope for; but I ex|pect that Chri&s;t will reveal his power in me, and give me &s;o much &s;trength and power again&s;t my lu&s;ts and corrup|tions, that they may not have dominion over me: Now if you tell me that you hope for &s;trength and power from Chri&s;t again&s;t &s;in, &s;atan and corruption, do you now tell
<PB N="120" REF="020309_0120_0FAEF935434664E8">
me that it is &s;till impo&s;&s;ible? It was impo&s;&s;ible before in|deed to live without &s;in, when thou did&s;t tru&s;t in thine own &s;trength; but now, when thou come&s;t to have grace and a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the <HI>Son of God, and Saviour of the world,</HI> that giveth thee ability to with|&s;tand temptation, and overcome thy corruptions, and the lu&s;ts of thy own heart, is it impo&s;&s;ible &s;till to live with|out &s;in? Then thou maye&s;t &s;ay, the devil's &s;lave I am and mu&s;t be; for there is no other power in Heaven or earth for thee to lay hold of, if thine own power, nor Chri&s;t's power neither can do; then thou do&s;t &s;ay, that the devil is Almighty. Thus they tell us, when Chri&s;t hath revealed his power, it is impo&s;&s;ible &s;till.</P>
<P>If I &s;hould call this antichri&s;tian doctrine, I could make it out. Ble&s;&s;ed be God, I do believe that Chri&s;t is able to pre&s;erve me from the devil's temptations, and all his in&s;tru|ments, if I believe; though I could not do it in mine own power, yet by Chri&s;t's power I may be pre&s;erved an hour without &s;in: If &s;o, then a day, and if one day, then a thou|&s;and days, if I live &s;o long; Chri&s;t hath promi&s;ed that he will <HI>brui&s;e Satan, and tread him under feet,</HI> and de&s;troy his works, and judge you whether &s;in be not the devil's work; &s;hall I de&s;pond, or de&s;pair to have the devil's work de|&s;troyed in me?</P>
<P>Here is ground for you all to believe, he that hath faith may lay hold of this power which is offered of God; there|fore lay hold of it, el&s;e your religion will be good for no|thing. This is the enjoyment of a true believer, that he receives power from Chri&s;t to deny him&s;elf; therefore all their pretended Chri&s;tianity and profe&s;&s;ions at the day of judgment, will melt away like &s;now. The&s;e canons, arti|cles, forms, liturgies, the&s;e will melt away when the day of the Lord comes to burn upon them; none but they that feel the redeeming virtues of the blood of Chri&s;t, that have their &s;ouls filled with the love of God; and they that will part with what&s;oever they love in the world, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, &s;hall be accepted.</P>
<P>I am not for &s;etting up this and the other &s;ect or opinion; if it be among tho&s;e of my own profe&s;&s;ion, if they profe&s;s holine&s;s, and bring forth unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, it is all one; I

&s;hall not value their profe&s;&s;ion. There are many in this city and nation, that have &s;heltered them&s;elves under the profe&s;&s;ion of truth, and talk of perfection, and have brought their lu&s;ts and imperfections with them: Here Antichri&s;t is trying another game to bring them under a profe&s;&s;ion that will &s;erve his turn; the devil will allow men profe&s;&s;ion, if they will live according to their own hearts lu&s;ts, &s;o that they may &s;ave his head from the blow that God's power will bring upon it, &s;o that they may di&s;honor the holy name and religion they make profe&s;&s;ion of; thus faith the apo&s;tle, <HI>I have told you often, and now tell you weeping;</HI> they were Chri&s;tians, &s;o called, to whom he &s;pake, but <HI>they were enemies to the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t,</HI> not to the profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t; he did not &s;ay they were &s;trangers to the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, but enemies to it; they let it fall, they kept the name, word and doctrine up, but they let the cro&s;s fall; how much were the&s;e Chri&s;tians worth? &s;ure but a little.</P>
<P>Nay, Antichri&s;t hath been &s;o &s;illy, that becau&s;e the words are &s;o put upon the cro&s;s, no being di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t without the cro&s;s; the words of &s;cripture are &s;o put upon it. Thinks Antichri&s;t, I &s;hall never per&s;uade the people to be at ea&s;e, unle&s;s I give them a cro&s;s; therefore he &s;ets them a making cro&s;&s;es. They mu&s;t be baptized with the cro&s;s; they &s;ay we deny not the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, we hang it about our necks, we &s;et it up in our meetings and acade|mies, and many princes, and wi&s;e men, and learned men, have been &s;o bewitched and drunk with delu&s;ions, that they have called this the Chri&s;t which they have made with their own hands; they have made Chri&s;ts, and prayed to them; and all their religion hath been putting together cro&s;&s;es, crucifixes, forms and liturgies, which they have made with their own hands.</P>
<P>Here is Chri&s;tianity in an empty profe&s;&s;ion, but where is the &s;oul of it? I would enquire for the life of it, I would &s;ee Chri&s;tianity living in love to God above all, and loving our neighbours as our&s;elves. When this Chri&s;|tianity comes, there will be no killing one another, nor per&s;ecuting one another, nor fulfilling the lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h, nor pleading for it neither.</P>

rai&s;ed, and life from Heaven come into them; and now religion begins to have a life and &s;oul, and &s;hews it&s;elf in a little remnant: There is a people rai&s;ed by God that feel life in their wor&s;hip, in their families, in their con|ver&s;ations, and in their behaviour towards relations, they do what they do as to God. Many lads and la&s;&s;es, men-&s;ervants and women-&s;ervants, they do their work and &s;er|vice, not barely to plea&s;e their ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s, but to plea&s;e God. <HI>The life they live is by the faith of the Son of God;</HI> they live as becomes the members of his body. Hu&s;bands love their wives, not &s;imply becau&s;e they are their wives, as the men of the world do, but they do it upon the account of inward religion, and of the divine fellow&s;hip and communion they have in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Hu&s;|bands &s;hould love their wives as Chri&s;t loved his church, and laid down his life for it; &s;o a man &s;hould love his wife, and be tender over her, and mini&s;ter to her.</P>
<P>The life of Chri&s;tianity hath taught us to behave our|&s;elves &s;o as God may have glory, and Chri&s;tianity be re|&s;tored to its ancient lu&s;tre and beauty that it had in for|mer times.</P>
<P>But &s;ome will &s;ay, do as well as you can, men will ne|ver love you; if you have the &s;oul of Chri&s;tianity, you &s;hall be reviled and &s;candalized. Men will make works again&s;t you, and &s;trow papers again&s;t you, and &s;et the ma|gi&s;trates again&s;t you; live as well as you can, they will follow you and di&s;turb you.</P>
<P>This is more than you know. If a man once comes to feel the life of Chri&s;tianity working in him, and the pow|er of it keeping him from doing evil, and wi&s;hing evil to his enemies, and di&s;po&s;ing his mind to a frame of praying for them, inclining him to pity them; if a man comes to this &s;tate, he is at peace in him&s;elf, and enjoys tran|quillity of mind; he looks up to the Mediator, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and feels an an&s;wer of peace in his own &s;oul, and is come to re&s;t in him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Now concerning per&s;ecution, hatred and enmity, between the woman's &s;eed and the &s;erpentine &s;eed, and how long it will la&s;t. God whom we &s;erve, did &s;ay to the devil in Paradi&s;e, <HI>I will put enmity between thee and the wo|man,

and between thy &s;eed and her &s;eed; it &s;hall brui&s;e thy head, and thou &s;halt brui&s;e his heel.</HI> So that it is not to be expected, that the &s;eed of the &s;erpent (tho&s;e that are born of that &s;eed) can love tho&s;e that are born of the woman's &s;eed. It is po&s;&s;ible, that tho&s;e that are born of the &s;eed of the &s;erpent, &s;hould be tran&s;lated and brought out of that corrupt &s;tate; but it is impo&s;&s;ible that tho&s;e that are <HI>born of the fle&s;h, &s;hould love tho&s;e that are born of the &s;pirit,</HI> while they continue in their unregenerate &s;tate, but per&s;ecute them. It is like a natural in&s;tinct, as for water to run downward, and fire to fly upward. Were not all men and women born children of wrath, and na|turally enemies in their minds to Chri&s;t Je&s;us? And did he not die and &s;uffer for them all? So that the very na|ture of the thing is the very rea&s;on why Chri&s;t died to redeem tho&s;e that were his enemies to be his friends.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e I, or any other to be a member of Chri&s;t, and men do per&s;ecute me, and revile me, and hate me, &s;hould I not love them, and do good unto them, when I &s;ee one infinitely better than either you or I, do it for us? <HI>when we were enemies, Chri&s;t hath &s;ent his Spirit into our hearts,</HI> that we might become friends of him, and of him that &s;ent him: This is the effect of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, and of his innocence, that enemies may become friends; thus have many been brought to a friend&s;hip of truth, that were ene|mies to it; if we could not &s;uffer for the te&s;timony we have received of God, what were it worth? But &s;eeing God hath not only given us to believe, but to &s;uffer for his name, many have been turned by this means from darkne&s;s to light, and many more will; the light breaks forth apace, notwith&s;tanding there hath been &s;o much ado to &s;top it.</P>
<P>It hath been the de&s;ign of many learned men of this nation, how &s;hall we &s;top the&s;e men's mouths that preach the doc|trine of truth in the inward parts, the light within, and Chri&s;t within them? I will not repeat the many laws that have been made again&s;t them that will not preach lies, but the power of Chri&s;t and his truth; now what will you do? You cannot lay hand on them as you u&s;ed to do; no, but we will reproach them with the tongue, we will render them odious to the government, as per&s;ons that wil over|turn

<P>The&s;e things we will preach, and we will go on in this te&s;timony, that the be&s;t way that man can take, is to break off their &s;in by repentance, and turn to God, their Maker, with their whole hearts, and they will look to their ways, and &s;earch, and try and examine their hearts, and if they &s;ee evil, to keep out of it; this is &s;uch a thing, as there is no with&s;tanding of it, it will go through this nation, and all the nations of the earth.</P>
<P>What if a company of people &s;hould combine together, and &s;ay, we will not have the &s;un to &s;hine upon the city of <HI>London;</HI> what cour&s;e mu&s;t we take? When the &s;un is down, we will build a bank or high wall to intercept its light; but notwith&s;tanding all their endeavours, when the &s;un ri&s;eth, it will get over their high banks and wall; &s;o all their de&s;igns, and all the contrivances again&s;t the light of the go&s;pel, and again&s;t Chri&s;t the Son of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and again&s;t the Spirit of Chri&s;t, the light will a&s;cend and get over the heads of them all, and it will confound them, and break through all oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>I exhort you all, my friends, that laying a&s;ide all doc|trines, and tenets, and contrivances among Chri&s;tians, as come to this &s;imple <HI>the&s;is</HI> and <HI>po&s;ition;</HI> it is no matter what I profe&s;s of <HI>religion,</HI> if my life is not an&s;werable to it, if there be not a love to God, and my neighbour, and to mine own &s;oul; there is no life nor power in my profe&s;&s;ion of religion. I will re&s;t &s;atisfied in the mea&s;ure of knowledge that God hath given me; I mu&s;t not do to my neighbour what I would not have my neighbour do to me; I mu&s;t be upright and &s;incere towards God; God will not accept of any wor&s;hip from me, when I am unclean in body and in mind too; we mu&s;t &s;ee that we be purified, for God will not accept of an offering from an unclean heart; <HI>you cannot bring a clean thing out of an unclean,</HI> &s;aith our Lord Je&s;us

Chri&s;t, the great preacher of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s; I mu&s;t <HI>fir&s;t make the tree good, before the fruit will be &s;o;</HI> you and I are the&s;e trees; till we have &s;omething good in our&s;elves, we cannot bring forth good fruit.</P>
<P>Therefore you mu&s;t have re&s;pect to the principle of &s;anc|tification in your own hearts, and turn to what you may feel an experience of in your&s;elves, &s;ome principle of grace and light in your hearts, that can di&s;tingui&s;h between good thoughts and evil thoughts. Is this good for me to do? I will go on in it with faith and courage; but if it be evil, I will not touch it, though there be profit and plea&s;ure to allure and draw me to it; I will not touch it, though I might gain the world by it.</P>
<P>Here is Chri&s;tianity with life and &s;oul in it; we have been &s;candalized as if we preached up error for ju&s;tification: We &s;ay there is no ju&s;tification without &s;anctification; &s;o you that know the power, live in it; and you that de&s;ire to know, turn your minds to the light and grace of God, and you will feel the power that will oppo&s;e &s;in in its motion, and it will never trouble you in its act and workings. If I would not do ill to my neighbour, and I judge &s;uch a motion when it is &s;ugge&s;ted, it will never trouble my con|&s;cience, becau&s;e when the devil moved me to it, I rejected it, I would not follow him. It is no &s;in to be tempted; for our Saviour, that was perfectly holy, and free from all &s;in, was yet tempted; he had motions in his mind, but he with&s;tood them, and re&s;i&s;ted the devil in all his temptations; Chri&s;t was tempted that he might be able to &s;uccour us when we are tempted; and he will do it for all tho&s;e that wait for him.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Preached at GRACE-CHURCH-STREET, <DATE>October 10, 1690.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>YOU that are met together in the name of the Lord, and have your expectation from God, and are re|ally waiting to receive a ble&s;&s;ing from his boun|tiful hand; you are they to whom the Lord will com|municate the good things of his kingdom, and in&s;truct you in the divine knowledge which the wi&s;dom of this world cannot find out; you &s;hall have your portion in the ble&s;&s;ings prepared for you, and laid up in Chri&s;t for you, to be handed forth to you from day to day for your &s;up|port. And hereby you have been pre&s;erved and kept alive unto this day. You have received your nouri&s;hment, and divine and &s;piritual refre&s;hment, always in the pre&s;ence of God; when you have been out of his pre&s;ence you have met with troubles, and darkne&s;s hath gendered upon your minds, and veiled and clouded your under&s;tandings, that you have been &s;ometimes in danger to lo&s;e your way, un|til you have returned again unto the <HI>great &s;hepherd <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> over&s;eer of your &s;ouls, by whom you have had acce&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> God.</HI> You that have had the&s;e experiences, O let your hearts and &s;ouls be engaged to continue together in one heart and one mind, &s;erving the Lord and waiting upon him for &s;omething that may do you good; that may &s;trength|en and confirm you in the ble&s;&s;ed truth.</P>
<P>For there are a great many that are convinced, that do yet want e&s;tabli&s;hment: There are a great many that know the truth, yet cannot be brought to abide in it, but are &s;ometimes drawn out of it, and then they meet with trou|ble in their minds, and <HI>di&s;tre&s;s and angui&s;h lay hold upon them,</HI> and they do not enjoy that tranquillity and peace, and that inward joy which they believe others do enjoy at the &s;ame time; and which they might have enjoyed if they had abode &s;tedfa&s;t in the truth. Now what is it that will e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch a one, but their waiting upon God
<PB N="127" REF="020309_0127_0FAEF93D5F562FB0">
to receive power from him to re&s;i&s;t the temptations, and the manifold wiles and &s;nares of their &s;oul's enemy, where|by they are daily in danger to be drawn away from God; drawn out of the way?</P>
<P>You know, friends, how the Lord brought us into this exerci&s;e of waiting upon him, by making us &s;en&s;ible that there was none could help us but him. Teachers we have always had, and men that have &s;poken of God, &s;poken of his power, and &s;poken of his wi&s;dom; but how to dwell in that power, and &s;tand e&s;tabli&s;hed in it, &s;o as at all times to re&s;i&s;t the power of the wicked one, is what no man can help us to; and upon this account it was, that the Lord's people were fain to cleave clo&s;e to him, and by faith to have their dependence upon him; and cry in their &s;ouls, Lord, unle&s;s thou e&s;tabli&s;h me, I &s;hall never be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The confirming power that &s;tays and &s;ettles their minds upon the Lord, it comes from him, it is handed to us through the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom we have believed in; they that kept their faith in him have had longings and breathings of &s;oul, that they might receive &s;ome divine ble&s;&s;ings by him, and through him. So that they that meet together in this mind, they find a &s;ettlement in the truth, as it is manife&s;ted and revealed in them, and goes down into the deep where unity is known, where they are of one mind, and the &s;oul is made capable of putting forth &s;trong cries to God, and living breathings and prayers to God, that he will teach them how they &s;hall profit, how they &s;hall grow, how they &s;hall &s;erve him, and honour him in their day; that he will reveal his power in them, to expel any darkne&s;s or veil that hath been gathered upon their minds, that doth hinder them from beholding &s;o much glory and excellency in the truth, and in the ways of God, as &s;ome they have beheld. And &s;o the&s;e are travellers that are tra|velling with the Lord in faith, to receive a ble&s;&s;ing at his hands. Their minds are not left to this, or that, or the other man, or to meer words or vi&s;ible things; but they feel the word of truth an&s;wering the truth in them|&s;elves; and they receive a comfort and benefit, becau&s;e they find a ble&s;&s;ing to ari&s;e in them. The&s;e words reach my
<PB N="128" REF="020309_0128_0FAEF93E16D667B0">
&s;oul; the&s;e admini&s;ter help to me, and I am comforted in them, becau&s;e I find tho&s;e works working in me, or wrought in me.</P>
<P>For, alas! my friends, many of you know, that there are &s;ome who hear the word, and the declarations in the word are but &s;ounds unto tho&s;e who have no experience of the work that is &s;ignified by the word; many &s;uch peo|ple do hear the lovely &s;ound, and they are affected ma|ny times to hear talk of the work of regeneration, and of the enjoyments of God's people, and how they are borne up in all their trials by an inward and divine power, and how they are always kept alive to God, and pre&s;erved in his living pre&s;ence; but this doth not bear them up in a time of trial; but if a trial or an affliction comes, they &s;ink under it, and they are filled with angui&s;h and per|plexity; &s;o that the word barely heard &s;poken, and not rooted in the mind, doth not mini&s;ter to the work; the words &s;poken do not carry that kind of operation upon them as to witne&s;s an inward work wrought upon them.</P>
<P>But where there is an effectual work and operation in the &s;oul, it continues in its labour and travel from death to life. And as tho&s;e heavenly things, tho&s;e divine operations of God's power are &s;poken of, there is an <HI>amen</HI> in your &s;ouls, &s;aying as far as you have travelled, thus hath God dealt with me, he hath indeed by his power carried &s;ome beyond my &s;tate and condition, and my faith is hereby &s;trengthened, and my hope is confirmed. He that hath begun a good work &s;o gloriou&s;ly in my &s;oul, will carry on his own work, and bring me to higher attainments, and further experiences that &s;ome of his &s;ervants bear witne&s;s of.</P>
<P>So that now being exerci&s;ed, the work goes on, and <HI>the plea&s;ure of the Lord pro&s;pereth in Chri&s;tians,</HI> that when they meet together <HI>in the name of the Lord,</HI> they know for them&s;elves that the Lord is pre&s;ent with them, they know what the word of the Lord is unto them; if they hear the word preached to another &s;tate and condition, yet they abide in and keep that which makes manife&s;t to them in their own &s;tate: And this &s;uffers not the &s;oul to be carried away with the word, and &s;ight and vi&s;ion of a higher &s;tate than their faith can witne&s;s to; and they keep low, and hum|ble
<PB N="129" REF="020309_0129_0FAEF93ECF0F1270">
and tender, and have a care of their own &s;ouls; as the apo&s;tle when he was come to glorious and high attainments in the work of the Lord, yet he would not <HI>glory of any thing,</HI> but what the grace of God wrought in him: We do not boa&s;t of things that are not wrought in us.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible for the creature to gather in, and comprehend the form of things, that they have not the work of in them; and a great many have done &s;o to their great damage, and &s;ome, it is to be feared, to their utter ruin. They have comprehended high things, and the notions of great attain|ments; they have heard them declared and &s;poken of thus, and &s;o &s;ome have in their &s;peculations declared to others their conceptions about tho&s;e things, yet tho&s;e things were never wrought in them; they could preach of humili|ation, when the root of pride was not removed; they could preach of regeneration, and the <HI>old man not put off,</HI> and the <HI>new man created in righteou&s;ne&s;s not put on.</HI> All this kind of preaching hath been in the world, and is &s;till too much in the world, but it hath not produced and brought forth any profit and advantage to the &s;oul, either to preach|er or hearer; for it hath not been accompanied with a divine and heavenly ble&s;&s;ing; but the true mini&s;try ordained of God brings forth a work of holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s in the &s;oul.</P>
<P>And therefore every one that God hath thus reached, and hath opened your under&s;tandings, and hath made you ca|pable of comprehending and under&s;tanding divine things, take heed le&s;t by the &s;ubtlety of Satan, and the wiles of your great enemy, you be at any time lifted up, and exalted in your minds, in the notion of the things that you have not attained; not that you &s;hould not &s;o under&s;tand the things of God that God openeth to you, as they are many times opened to the creature, before the work of them is in the heart of the creature: And why &s;o? why are they opened to me? It is for thy encouragement, that if thou do&s;t hold on, and be &s;tedfa&s;t in waiting upon the Lord, the&s;e things God hath in &s;tore for thee.</P>
<P>Now the creature waits, and &s;aith, though I have not at|tained &s;uch things as I have &s;een, yet the very &s;ight of them encourageth me to wait upon the Lord, that I may expe|rience

the witne&s;s of them in my&s;elf: There are many that have &s;ome ta&s;te of great joy, and apprehen&s;ions of heavenly things, which they have not attained, but they know what they are waiting upon God for; not that they may have a little joy, which pa&s;&s;eth through them, but come to have that joy and tranquillity which will accompany them in all their doings, and their whole conver&s;ation. God hath open|ed many things to you, and you have &s;een the way of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s which he hath ca&s;t up for you; and many have taken &s;trait &s;teps to them&s;elves, till they have attained to &s;ay, <HI>now my &s;alvation is nearer than when I at fir&s;t believed.</HI> Let &s;uch go on and follow that guide by which they have been directed, and they &s;hall at la&s;t attain to a further &s;tate, not only to know that their &s;alvation is now nearer than when they at fir&s;t believed, but that they may come through the Divine Spirit of grace that they followed, and &s;o clo&s;ely cleaved to, as their ble&s;&s;ed guide in their way, to have an en|trance admini&s;tered to them abundantly into the &s;alvation of God, whereby they may &s;it down, in the kingdom of God, with Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob, and have a wall about them, which is the &s;alvation of God.</P>
<P>Here is a great encouragement for &s;inners, and upright ones, <HI>to follow on to know the Lord,</HI> and then they are &s;ure they &s;hall know him, for they &s;hall behold his glo|ry, and their &s;ouls &s;hall be &s;atisfied, for nothing el&s;e will &s;atisfy them.</P>
<P>People may have great openings, and great di&s;coveries of things, and may have delight and joy in the opening of things, as it was with the di&s;ciples, when Chri&s;t our Lord conver&s;ed with them in the fle&s;h; he opened many things to them, and they had great joy and comfort in tho&s;e things which he opened to them, yet there was &s;ome|thing wanting to &s;uffice them. <HI>Philip</HI> &s;aid unto Chri&s;t, <HI>Lord &s;hew us the Father, and it &s;ufficeth us: John</HI> xiv, 8. There was &s;omething further to be di&s;covered and reveal|ed, &s;o that they could not find their &s;ouls to be &s;atisfi|ed and &s;ufficed, till they had it. Chri&s;t gave them &s;uch an an&s;wer as relates to that mini&s;tration that we are now under; <HI>he that hath &s;een the Son, hath &s;een the Father.</HI> Now they had &s;een Chri&s;t daily, and conver&s;ed with him,
<PB N="131" REF="020309_0131_0FAEF941B04F5AF8">
and had eat and drank with him in that fle&s;hly and bodily appearance wherein he conver&s;ed with them; but they had not a &s;ight of the Eternal Son of God in a &s;piritual man|ner, as he was the Son of God, and their Saviour; they had not &s;een him &s;o. And he that hath &s;een Chri&s;t in a &s;piritual manner, hath &s;een the Father al&s;o.</P>
<P>So it is with us in our day. We have, in our profe&s;|&s;ion, the teaching of this and that man. We have con|ver&s;ed with Chri&s;t, as it were, to his fle&s;hly appearance. We have read the hi&s;tory of his birth, and of his life and great miracles, and of the great love he had to mankind, by which he laid down his life for them. We have been conver&s;ing with Chri&s;t as to his fle&s;hly manife&s;tation; but con&s;ider whether there doth not, till now, remain an empty place in our &s;ouls, &s;omething that is not &s;ufficed and &s;a|tisfied?</P>
<P>What would you have? Have you not &s;cripture? Read you not there of the birth, life, death, re&s;urrection and a&s;|cen&s;ion of Chri&s;t? I would &s;till have &s;omething more, for that will not &s;uffice me; I would have pardon of &s;in, and my peace with God, <HI>and the light of his countenance lifted up upon me,</HI> and further manife&s;tations of Chri&s;t to my &s;oul. We can never &s;ee the glory of God, but in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. This is the di&s;covery that Chri&s;t makes to the &s;oul that believeth in him; this is that which gives &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>A Chri&s;tian's work is to be conver&s;ing with him, and exerci&s;ing his mind under the gathering and teaching of him, that can lead him to the Father. None but Chri&s;t can do that, lead them to the Father, and &s;hew them the Father; and he hath in our day revealed him&s;elf, and made him&s;elf manife&s;t by his &s;pirit, that &s;pirit, by which we come to know his holy teaching, reproof and in&s;truction, daily di&s;covered in our &s;ouls. The &s;pirit is our guide; that &s;pirit we are led by, and are to walk in. Let men go under what form and denomination they will, <HI>they that have not the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, are none of his,</HI> until they come to be guided by his &s;pirit.</P>
<P>People are not led into &s;in by the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t; they will tell you the&s;e are the devil's temptations, and
<PB N="132" REF="020309_0132_0FAEF9430C159CD8">
the frailty of our nature, and the corruption of our hearts, by which we are led into &s;in; it is not the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t. It would be a horrid thing for men to &s;ay that the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t led them into &s;in; there are few or none &s;o wicked as to &s;ay &s;o. The bu&s;ine&s;s we are to do in the world is, to obey the will of God: And where the un|der&s;tandings of men are &s;o illuminated, that they are &s;a|tisfied in their minds, that God hath been plea&s;ed to give them a manife&s;tation of the &s;pirit to profit withal; all tho&s;e that have this &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, are directed by it to do the will of God, and to deny their own wills, and the will of others, that would draw them from their du|ty that they owe to God in their generation.</P>
<P>It is an excellent &s;tate and condition for a man to be guided by the &s;pirit, and to be brought under the govern|ment of Chri&s;t, who is <HI>the way, the truth, and the life.</HI> So that they that come under this government&punc; are directed and pointed out every day to do the will of God. This thou mu&s;t do, and God will be plea&s;ed with thee; and this thou maye&s;t not do, for if thou doe&s;t it, the Lord will be angry with thee; it is &s;in again&s;t God. So that we have a heavenly advantage of being taught of God by his &s;pirit, to have the divine and heavenly teaching of the &s;pirit of God revealed in us; if we are at a lo&s;s, or make a que&s;tion, or di&s;pute about a matter, the <HI>&s;pirit will look us into all truth,</HI> if we give up our&s;elves to his guidance and teaching.</P>
<P>This hath been our de&s;ire and labour many years, not to draw people to ob&s;erve what we &s;ay; for who can direct another man in all things relating to the &s;ervice of God? If we were ever &s;o certain our&s;elves, we could not convey certainty and infallibility upon all occa&s;ions to another, if we &s;hould &s;peak ever &s;o much, and be ever &s;o conver&s;ant with them. Therefore our work is, that all people, in all things relating to their &s;ouls, might have re|cour&s;e continually to the infallible teacher and guide, which God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, hath made known to them. If people be ruled by this, they cannot but live in unity, and love one another; they will not fall into malice, con|tention, and hatred one again&s;t another. It is impo&s;&s;ible

for nations to make war, and de&s;troy one another, if they would be guided by the unerring &s;pirit of Chri&s;t; for how &s;hould it contradict it&s;elf? For how can any thing agree with the &s;tandard of truth, which Chri&s;t hath &s;et up, that acts in contradiction to it? For nothing is truth but what concurs with it; therefore it mu&s;t needs agree with it&s;elf. If we be directed by the &s;pirit, we &s;hall call that good which is really good; and that evil which is &s;o. If there be thou&s;ands directed by the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, which leads into all truth, that which is good to one, is &s;o to all; and that which is evil to one, is &s;o to all. We mu&s;t fir&s;t know what is good, and then receive power to do it. If we come to be in&s;tructed by the unerring &s;pirit, <HI>to know what is the good and acceptable will of God,</HI> we &s;hall re|ceive daily power from him to do the will of God; we &s;hall all &s;peak the &s;ame thing, and be of the &s;ame mind, and live in love and unity. There is no evil wilfully done again&s;t God, where the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, the go&s;pel &s;pirit, comes to prevail upon us; it will bring us to a peaceablene&s;s of &s;pirit, to live in love and unity. And the great work we have in the world, will be to do the good and acceptable will of God, both with re&s;pect to our &s;olemn wor&s;hip of God, and our duties towards our neighbours. Then there will be tranquillity, peace and joy, and comfort to all the churches of Chri&s;t that are under his government. And it is given to the &s;ons and daugh|ters of men every where, when they come under the yoke of Chri&s;t, and take up a daily cro&s;s, and live in &s;elf-denial; this will bring peace and concord among them.</P>
<P>Many will come to our meetings, and &s;pend a little time to hear what we &s;ay. We exhort them to give up them&s;elves to the peaceable government of the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, that <HI>will fini&s;h tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and make an end of &s;in,</HI> and bring into the &s;oul (where &s;in reigned) <HI>everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Where there is a great deal of pride, ma|lice and envy, the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t will root it up; and all that evil that the enemy hath planted in men, he will pluck it up, and bring in <HI>everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and plant love in the &s;ame &s;oul, and e&s;tabli&s;h and &s;ettle it.

Becau&s;e there is that life and grace &s;tirring in the heart that makes it profitable, and truth doth &s;o prevail, that it makes us do tho&s;e things that are good and pro|fitable, and to avoid tho&s;e things that are reprovable. If thou woulde&s;t hearken to the &s;pirit, that is the reprover, that convinceth of &s;in, thou mu&s;t turn away thy mind from that which will lead into tho&s;e things that are reproveable, otherwi&s;e thou wilt be under condemnation in thine own bo&s;om.</P>
<P>When the Spirit of God illuminates men to &s;ee &s;in, the evil of &s;in, he will give them power again&s;t it; but when they come to receive power again&s;t it, and &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s in the ways of God, what will be the effect of that? If I become righteous, and live a holy life, and my companions be wicked, they will mock me, and reproach me, what benefit &s;hall I have by being righteous? I &s;ee evidently I &s;hall lo&s;e many advantages which I might otherwi&s;e reap, and reach with mine own hand. I mu&s;t for&s;ake my profits and plea&s;ure, and other delights of this world.</P>
<P>The di&s;ciples &s;aid to Chri&s;t, <HI>we have for&s;aken all, and followed thee;</HI> what &s;hall we have? People before they would for&s;ake all would have &s;omething in the room of it. Chri&s;t tells them, <HI>that he that hath for&s;aken all, father and mother, brother and &s;i&s;ter, and hou&s;e and land, for his name &s;ake, &s;hall have in this life an hundred fold, and in the world to come, eternal life.</HI> What is the mean|ing of that, they &s;hall have in this life an hundred fold? Chri&s;t that is truth it&s;elf, that cannot lie, hath promi&s;ed, that they that for&s;ake all, &s;hall receive an hundred fold: Now people are ready to gra&s;p at it; they think it is &s;ome|thing that will an&s;wer the lo&s;s of what they part withal; what thou receive&s;t in this promi&s;e, mu&s;t not be of the &s;ame &s;ort and kind with tho&s;e things thou did&s;t part withal; but when thou ha&s;t parted with all for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, and the go&s;pel,

thou &s;halt receive that which thou &s;halt acknowledge is an hundred fold better, and will make thee an hundred fold richer and happier, and it will give thee an hundred fold more than all that thou ha&s;t parted with could give thee.</P>
<P>If we part with &s;in, we part with that which brings bon|dage and fear of death; having parted with that, then thy fear and bondage is gone, and thou live&s;t then the re&s;t of thy life-time at liberty: But this is not all, thou live&s;t in the enjoyment of the favour of God, thou &s;halt have the &s;en&s;e of his love, and the comfort of his Holy Spirit, and you &s;hall live in peace and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and <HI>trea&s;ure up to your&s;elves glory, honour, immortality, and eternal life;</HI> whereas before you did <HI>trea&s;ure up only wrath again&s;t the day of wrath, and the revelation of the righteous judgment of God;</HI> thou &s;halt receive an hundred fold, that which is an hundred fold better. Tho&s;e that part with the things that are reprovable, and do what Chri&s;t in his day performed, the good and acceptable will of God, the enjoyments that he hath in Chri&s;t, and the comfort, peace and tranquillity he enjoys, is an hundred fold better and more delightful than all the plea&s;ures of &s;in, and the plea&s;ures and delights of &s;hows, and &s;ights and plays, and comedies, which vain men entertain them&s;elves with in their carnal &s;tate. A carnal man cannot under&s;tand and di&s;cern the things of God, and the plea&s;ures that are to be had in his holy ways; he only looks <HI>at the things that are &s;een, which are temporal, and not at the things that are not &s;een, which are eternal.</HI></P>
<P>But, my friends, tho&s;e things which are un&s;een, are not &s;o un&s;een, but that when a man hath an eye opened within him of the &s;ame nature with tho&s;e things, he can &s;ee them: Ble&s;&s;ed be God that we have an eye opened to &s;ee &s;piritual things, to &s;ee the heavenly trea&s;ure, and enjoy it in the&s;e earthen ve&s;&s;els.</P>

<P>Now this doth declare and &s;ignify, that there mu&s;t be &s;omething upon which this faith mu&s;t work, that mu&s;t be the object and foundation of it: Faith as it worketh in the creature, worketh upon &s;omething; it lays hold on &s;omething in which there is a capacity of plea&s;ing God. Now if <HI>we are all by nature children of wrath,</HI> and that no one of him&s;elf can plea&s;e God, then there mu&s;t be &s;omething that is &s;upernatural, that mu&s;t be the object of that faith by which men alone can plea&s;e God; and this mu&s;t be made manife&s;t to the creature for its help, to be its director and &s;upporter in that work that is too mighty for him&s;elf, too great a work for a man or woman, too deep, too profound for any man's abilities, power, wi&s;dom, and acquirements, that he can attain to in this world, to wor|&s;hip God aright. To wor&s;hip God, that is to perform a pure wor&s;hip to a pure God; <HI>who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</HI> Now if we are all obliged to bring a clean wor|&s;hip, a pure wor&s;hip to a pure and holy God, who hath created us and all things, where &s;hall we have it? Not out of an unclean heart, not out of a defiled mind; there is no bringing it forth from thence, for that is the &s;tate and con|dition that men are fallen into by &s;in, in which their minds and con&s;ciences are defiled, their hearts are polluted, and their affections depraved and &s;et upon wrong objects; and in this &s;tate none can &s;erve God aright: That which is pure and holy mu&s;t be fir&s;t made known, revealed, di&s;covered, and believed, before people can perform a right wor&s;hip to God.</P>
<P>And therefore in vain is it, to go and drive people to this and that wor&s;hip, and force people to this and that &s;ervice
<PB N="140" REF="020309_0140_0FAEF9489E687068">
and conformity, upon the account of the wor&s;hip of God. This is vain wor&s;hip; when they have done all, it is not acceptable to God; the poor creature hath no return from the Lord, for God accepts no &s;ervice or wor&s;hip, but only through his Son. And if &s;o be, men cannot pray and preach in the &s;pirit of his &s;on, and cannot pre&s;ent their complaints and &s;upplication to God, but by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and help of his ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, there is no rea&s;on in religion why people &s;hould expect a return and an&s;wer from God of the prayers they make. For it is the general doctrine of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> that Chri&s;t Je&s;us is appointed of God for a Mediator be|tween God and man, and all the acceptance we have, or de&s;ire to have, mu&s;t be through him: And therefore if we pray without him, and perform this and the other duty without him, it is contrary to the doctrine of Chri&s;tianity, to think that ever we &s;hould have acceptance in God's &s;ight.</P>
<P>Therefore there is a nece&s;&s;ity for every man and woman that de&s;ires to be religious, that hath a religious mind, and is willing to wor&s;hip God, and &s;erve God aright, there is a nece&s;&s;ity that they come to the knowledge of Chri&s;t, who tells us that he is <HI>the way to the Father.</HI> They that go any other way, go a wrong way; but they that go unto God by Chri&s;t, they do receive from him power to draw near to God; and through him they receive from God all tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings that their &s;ouls &s;tand in need of.</P>
<P>So here would be an end of all religions the world is full of; of all the &s;everal wor&s;hips that men have made. They have invented and found out &s;everal ways for peo|ple to wor&s;hip and &s;erve God. This and the other ce|remony; this and the other ob&s;ervation and method of preaching and praying. If all this be without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and divine help of the Mediator, through whom alone we can ju&s;tly expect acceptance at God's hands, it is all good for nothing. Therefore the fir&s;t le&s;&s;on of a Chri&s;tian in point of wor&s;hip, is, that he come to the knowledge of Chri&s;t, by whom, and through whom, he may expect favour with God.</P>
<P>Now &s;ome people &s;ay, we are already come to the knowledge of Chri&s;t; we have read the relation in the go&s;pel of his conception, birth, life and death, re&s;urrec|tion
<PB N="141" REF="020309_0141_0FAEF94990190478">
and a&s;cen&s;ion. Now where this belief doth give a man this kind of Chri&s;tian knowledge, it doth open a door and way for him into the pre&s;ence of God. This is a que&s;tion that ought &s;eriou&s;ly to be con&s;idered; for if we err in this que&s;tion, we err in all: This is like &s;tumbling at the thre&s;hold, and never coming into the hou&s;e. If we mi&s;take in laying hold of Chri&s;t, we mi&s;take in our wor&s;hip, and in all matters that relate to life and &s;alvation.</P>
<P>For if we mu&s;t have another &s;ort of knowledge of Chri&s;t, than we can have from the reports of others; if I mu&s;t have Chri&s;t revealed in me before I can have the hope of glory; if I mu&s;t have the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t in me, to help me to put up my reque&s;ts and &s;upplications, before he can pre&s;ent them to the Father, then all literal knowledge and faith cannot &s;tand men in any &s;tead; this is evident by the te&s;timony of all the writers of the New Te&s;ta|ment. Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles did concurrently &s;ignify, that the hope of a Chri&s;tian, the power and &s;trength of a Chri&s;tian, all lies in this, that they had known the reve|lation of Chri&s;t, and the powerful operation of the &s;pirit working in them; this was that which was well plea&s;ing to God. Many &s;criptures might be &s;poken of, but you know the &s;criptures, and can read them, and &s;ee in them the concurrent te&s;timony of all holy men to this day, that the knowledge they had of Chri&s;t was a divine knowledge, a &s;piritual knowledge; it was a knowing him after the &s;pirit; it was a revelation of Chri&s;t in them, that &s;epa|rated and di&s;tingui&s;hed them from reprobates; even the knowledge of God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t their Lord. Why &s;hould not we come to this knowledge as well as they? The Lord is the &s;ame, and his power is the &s;ame, and his <HI>arm is not &s;hortened.</HI> We may &s;ee as much need of divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and divine love, as ever men did; we can perform no duty, either of prayer or preaching, with|out divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance; not &s;o much as a &s;igh or groan, that may have acceptance with God, without the help of his Spirit. <HI>The Spirit helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what we &s;hould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it&s;elf maketh interce&s;&s;ion for us with groanings which cannot be uttered: Rom.</HI> viii, 26. If we go about the duty of
<PB N="142" REF="020309_0142_0FAEF94A221334A0">
prayer without divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, we &s;ee what &s;ad work we make of it; if we pray not in the &s;pirit, and with the under&s;tanding, how can we receive the thing we pray for? But if we <HI>pray in the &s;pirit, and with the under&s;tanding al&s;o,</HI> then the <HI>&s;pirit helps our infirmities;</HI> the &s;pirit that came from God brings us the things we &s;tand in need of.</P>
<P>So that a Chri&s;tian hath a foundation for his wor&s;hip and Chri&s;tian performance; what is that foundation? Nothing that is corrupt, if it be, it is good for nothing; for nothing that is corrupted and that defiles, can be ac|ceptable and plea&s;ing to God; we are all polluted and defiled by nature; how can carnal men wor&s;hip a Spiri|tual God? Carnal men that are in death and darkne&s;s, cannot wor&s;hip that God that is light, and dwells in light, that is inacce&s;&s;ible, that is <HI>of purer eyes than to behold iniquity.</HI> Carnal men want a foundation for their wor|&s;hip, and will until they come to that foundation that God hath laid.</P>
<P>Now, that I may &s;peak intelligibly what the Lord hath laid upon my heart, I would &s;ay thus: There is an u|niver&s;al benefit and privilege di&s;tributed and given free|ly of God, unto the &s;ons and daughters of men, in their natural &s;tate, through his Son, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in that he hath cau&s;ed his light to &s;hine, and his grace to be extend|ed to every man; <HI>for the grace of God,</HI> which bringeth &s;alvation (for it is not by works) <HI>hath appeared unto all men,</HI> and bringeth light, by which every man may &s;ee how to wor&s;hip God; God hath enlightened every man, and this light comes by Chri&s;t the Mediator; this Medi|ator is the way that men mu&s;t walk in, if they will come back again to God; for men are run out and de|parted from God; if men will draw near to God, and take &s;ome foot-&s;teps towads the kingdom of God, from the kingdom of &s;in and &s;atan, they mu&s;t mind the way, the way mu&s;t be their director, they mu&s;t not go which way they li&s;t.</P>
<P>This is that which was prophe&s;ied of Chri&s;t; &s;aith God, by the prophet <HI>I&s;aiah, I will give him for a leader.</HI> I would fain return to God, and go out of the kingdom of &s;in and &s;atan, to the kingdom of God: God hath given Chri&s;t to lead me; if
<PB N="143" REF="020309_0143_0FAEF94C0F53A520">
knew what way he would lead me in, I would go that way. As &s;oon as a man takes hold of Chri&s;t, his grace, and &s;pi|rit, and life, he will be ready to &s;ay, I am corrupt; my &s;en&s;es are corrupt, my mind is depraved, my con&s;cience defiled and polluted; but I have found out &s;omething that God hath be&s;towed upon me, that is e&s;&s;ential, holy and pure, that did never con&s;ent to my corruption, but is a witne&s;s for God again&s;t it: Here now a Chri&s;tian lays hold on Chri&s;t, the leader; which way will he lead me? If thou laye&s;t hold of this guide, he will lead thee out of evil, he will teach thee to cea&s;e to do evil, and &s;peak evil: This light will lead thee to nothing that will di&s;honour God, or defile thine own &s;oul: But this is not all, we mu&s;t not only cea&s;e to do evil, but we mu&s;t be doing &s;omething; there mu&s;t be a breaking off from pride, <HI>fooli&s;h je&s;ting, evil communication;</HI> but this is not all that he will lead me to; let us learn that le&s;&s;on, <HI>cea&s;e to do evil.</HI> This doctrine was preached before Chri&s;tianity was preached, as it is now preached; the prophets of old preathed this doctrine to the <HI>Jews</HI> that were under an outward admini&s;tration, <HI>cea&s;e to do evil, and learn to do well,</HI> then I will plead with you, and di&s;cour&s;e with you, &s;aith the Lord: <HI>Come now, let us rea&s;on together, &s;aith the Lord, though your &s;ins be as &s;car|let, they &s;hall be as white as &s;now; though they be red like crim&s;on, they &s;hall be as wool.</HI></P>
<P>This is the fir&s;t le&s;&s;on that a true Chri&s;tian learns in his turning to God, in his change and tran&s;lation, <HI>to cea&s;e from that which is evil:</HI> Here is a ce&s;&s;ation of rebellion, and here is &s;ome hopes of being reconciled to God; a man hath been a rebel again&s;t his Maker, but he hath now received help to re&s;i&s;t tho&s;e temptations that prevail over him: But there is no wor&s;hipping yet, there is a forward mind in men to do &s;omething that is plea&s;ing to God; but there are &s;ome that are not troubled at all for their evil ways, and dread not God's anger, but make a mock at &s;in, that draw others to it, and make them&s;elves merry in it: And there is a &s;ort &s;o far touched with a divine &s;en&s;e of God's love to them, that they have al&s;o a &s;en&s;e of his anger and indigna|tion, becau&s;e of their &s;in; and they would be fain out of his anger; and who can blame them? When a man feels the
<PB N="144" REF="020309_0144_0FAEF94D967D5300">
anger of God burning like a fire in his bo&s;om, who can blame that man if he de&s;ire peace with God? If he be under a &s;en&s;e of the di&s;plea&s;ure and indignation of the Almighty, he mu&s;t not ha&s;te too &s;oon out of that condition he is brought into; for this is God's purpo&s;e, and this is the fruit of all his troubles and afflictions, to take away &s;in: God hath no other end or de&s;ign in the affliction that is upon him, than to take away &s;in; when God hath brought a people into a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and dejected &s;tate for their &s;in, the fruit that God expects, is the <HI>taking away of their &s;in,</HI> and he will hide pride from them, and humble them before him; if this be the purpo&s;e of God, that he intends to purge and purify his people; then &s;aith the poor creature, it God de&s;ign to pu|rify me from &s;in, then I will pray to God to &s;upport me, and bear me up under his indignation: That is the cry of the &s;oul that he may not be brought too &s;oon from under the judgment of God, but may be &s;upported and hid in the hollow of God's hand, until the time of remi&s;&s;ion and refre&s;hing comes, that he may behold the light of God's countenance.</P>
<P>Here is encouragement for every one that is acquainted with this divine principle of grace, that will be led by it, and follow it &s;o far as to be led out of evil; then they will be fitted to do &s;omething in the work of God; every &s;igh and groan that thou ha&s;t the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;pirit of God to help thee in, is a part of wor&s;hip: All thy broken|ne&s;s of heart is part of wor&s;hip; hereby thou acknowledg|e&s;t the great God, that he is able to help thee on in thy way, and to pardon thy iniquity, and blot out thy tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, and give thee all tho&s;e heavenly ble&s;&s;ings that thy &s;oul doth &s;tand in need of. Then thy &s;oul will how down to God in acts of holy wor&s;hip, and &s;ay, with a humble confidence and expectation, God will do all tho&s;e things in me, and for me, that will promote my &s;alvati|on. It is nothing in religion for people to go from pray|ing and preaching to &s;inning; but God mu&s;t have a holy &s;acrifice, and that mu&s;t come out of a pure heart. Now when a man is brought by the help of God, and by the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Mediator. Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to break off from his &s;in, then he &s;tands fair to become a child of God,
<PB N="145" REF="020309_0145_0FAEF94E63D76A40">
and to be a &s;ervant of God, and to do &s;omething for God in his generation, and to offer to God prai&s;e and thank&s;|giving, and to perform all other duties that God &s;hall lead him into.</P>
<P>But &s;ome will &s;ay, what, mu&s;t not we do any thing? I have deeply weighed that que&s;tion, what a poor man or woman mu&s;t do, that is come out of bondage. There is a propen&s;ity in people to be doing, they would fain do &s;omething, they would be doing; they &s;ay, what &s;hall I do? If I do &s;ome|thing that plea&s;es not God, I had better let it alone; and I can do nothing acceptable to God without divine a&s;|&s;i&s;tance: Such a one that &s;ees his own impotency and inability, will ca&s;t his care upon God, and will &s;ay, the Lord is able to lead me and guide me: I am ready to do thy will, O God! Make it clear to me that this is thy will, and that this is that which thou require&s;t; I am ready to do it, though it be a cro&s;s to mine own will: He is ready to go on in God's way, in the way of Chri&s;tianity; &s;uch a one that hath the true knowledge of Chri&s;t, if he &s;peaks, the Spirit of Chri&s;t &s;peaks in him; if he prays, it is through the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, through whom God alone is appea&s;ed and reconciled, and through whom they may re|ceive a ble&s;&s;ing from God's hands: But for men to run on in their own wills, and to do a thing becau&s;e they will do it, they had better &s;it &s;till; this doing in their own wills, hath filled the world with a &s;ort of Chri&s;tians that want accep|tance with God, which is to be had alone through the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and the want of the guidance of God's Holy Spirit, is the mi&s;ery and downfal of Chri&s;tianity in our days.</P>
<P>Therefore it is our work and bu&s;ine&s;s to build upon that foundation which God hath laid; no wor&s;hip is plea&s;ing to God, but that which ari&s;eth from that &s;pring that is pure and holy: If I cannot find that which will keep me from all pollution and defilement, if I cannot find that, I mu&s;t &s;tay till I can; to begin a wor&s;hip and a religion without I know that it is acceptable to God, is but lo&s;t labour, and time &s;pent in vain.</P>
<P>Therefore, friends, let every one that de&s;ires to be reli|gious, turn their mind inward, wait for the gift of God, which is e&s;&s;entially pure, that never did con&s;ent to evil,
<PB N="146" REF="020309_0146_0FAEF94EA4E071E8">
that never mixed with the corruption of nature, but bears witne&s;s to the light, that will guide you and lead you, and conduct you fir&s;t out of &s;in; then it will lead you into that wor&s;hip and religion, and the performance of tho&s;e things that are plea&s;ing to God. They that are come thus to wor&s;hip, they do not only know what the Lord requires of them, and when he requires it of them, but they are given up into the hands of God; they pray, preach, exhort, and live according to the will of God.</P>
<P>It is hard for people in a carnal &s;tate to believe this; but you that are believers, that are come to know the gift of God in your&s;elves, and the nece&s;&s;ity of being ruled by him, you will believe us, for none el&s;e will believe us; let us preach to as many people and nations as we will, none will receive us as true mini&s;ters, but tho&s;e that have the truth in their own hearts; if there be any that de&s;pi&s;eth the grace of God in his own heart, he hates that which chides and re|proves him; if there be &s;uch a man, he will hate me becau&s;e I am a mini&s;ter and a witne&s;s of the grace of God, and of that truth in the inward parts, which is the ground and foundation that man hath of acceptance with God. A wicked, carnal wretch will &s;ay, I hate &s;uch a one, I hate the light, that which checks me, and witne&s;&s;eth again&s;t me; thou art &s;uch a one as beare&s;t witne&s;s again&s;t me, therefore I hate thee: It is very true, it cannot be otherwi&s;e. Now our de&s;ire and labour is, that men may come to the love of the truth in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>You know there are a great many other mini&s;ters, who&s;e labour is to per&s;uade people to believe what they &s;ay; to lay down a doctrine, and prove it by &s;cripture and rea|&s;on, and &s;et it home upon their minds by &s;uch te&s;timony as the &s;cripture affords, and hereupon they prevail on the minds and judgments of people, to believe what they lay down.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to lay down a po&s;ition, and prove it, and convince people that it mu&s;t be according to &s;cripture; but when a per&s;on is convinced of a principle of truth, he is not regenerated thereby, and come to God; therefore, though he cannot deny the doctrine of truth in words, yet he can deny it in works, and doth not rightly come
<PB N="147" REF="020309_0147_0FAEF94F55457710">
to love it. If people would believe what we &s;ay, and ob&s;erve what argument we bring to prove a po&s;ition, they may be convinced of the doctrine of truth, and come to a profe&s;&s;ion of it, and yet be &s;trangers to it, till they come to love it in them&s;elves: If it were not for this, we would leave preaching, if God had not given a mea&s;ure and manife&s;tation of the &s;pirit to every man to profit withal. You have it in your&s;elves, we are but as monitors to you, to put you in mind of it; you have &s;o much bu&s;ine&s;s in the world, that you have not had lei&s;ure to take notice of it.</P>
<P>A man may have a rich jewel, and be poor notwith|&s;tanding, till he come to know the value of it.</P>
<P>A man hath a rich and precious jewel; a pearl be&s;towed upon him, that would make him rich in faith and love to God, and qualify him for the kingdom of God, and make him an heir of it; but he knows not, nor under|&s;tands the value of it, and e&s;teems it not; therefore God hath rai&s;ed up mini&s;ters to put you in mind of it, that you may be happy forever, and live in ble&s;&s;edne&s;s to all eternity; <HI>who&s;oever hath an ear to hear, let him hear;</HI> and when they hear what we &s;ay, let them take the benefit of it to their own &s;ouls. We bring not truth to you, but God hath be&s;towed it upon you; you will be rich indeed, if you do as a man that bought a field where the precious pearl was, and digged till he found it. Come to the foun|dation upon which you &s;hould build all your hopes of happine&s;s, and depend not upon your own works, or re|ligious performances, for acceptance with God; for there is no acceptance with God, but only through Chri&s;t, we are only accepted of God through him. Tho&s;e that will become Chri&s;tians indeed, and wor&s;hip God as he hath or|dained and appointed him&s;elf to be wor&s;hipped, they mu&s;t come to the principle of light and grace in their own hearts, which they have in, and through Chri&s;t, and they will find acceptance with God.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON XIII. <HI>The</HI> DIVINE LIFE <HI>of</HI> CHRIST JESUS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Preached at GRACE-CHURCH-STREET, <DATE>March 16, 1691.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>THE ble&s;&s;ed life of Chri&s;t is not of this world; and it ought to be your care in all your religious a&s;|&s;emblies, that you be gathered into the inward, feeling &s;en&s;e, of this divine life; that you may feel your fellow&s;hip and communion in that life of Chri&s;t that is not of this world. And may all of you lay hold upon it; for this is the nouri&s;hment and the heavenly bread, with which <HI>the children of the kingdom are fed and nouri&s;hed from day to day;</HI> there are many that feed upon words, that are not the children of the kingdom of God; but the begot|ten of God are come to know the virtue of the divine life, Chri&s;t Je&s;us; their feeding and their nouri&s;hment is by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God, and they grow up to life eternal by that divine and hea|venly gift, that God the Father hath be&s;towed upon them, through his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and they enjoy the com|munion of &s;aints, through this divine Head of the Church, that communicates of his life and virtue through every mem|ber, by which they are &s;anctified, and every day more and more prepared for that living and eternal inheritance laid up for the children of God.</P>
<P>And when there are a people that are thus gathered in|to the life of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they are able to draw nigh to God; they feel the power of entrance, becau&s;e their &s;in is removed that did formerly lie at the door; and the way is opened and con&s;ecrated for them to draw nigh and partake of the table of the Lord, by which they grow &s;tronger and &s;tronger in his might and power, and are thereby enabled to perform the whole will of God, and that divine wor&s;hip and religious &s;ervice, which God requireth at their hands in their day.</P>
<P>For it is very certain, and we have found it by expe|rience, that the words of our Lord to his di&s;ciples of old

are true; <HI>without me</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>ye can do nothing.</HI> For though people may meet together, and may pretend and &s;et up a form of wor&s;hip, and of religion in their own wills, yet it all amounts to nothing, with re&s;pect to ac|ceptance with the Lord; there is no return in their &s;ouls, no addition of life, nor encrea&s;e and growth of life; they are not nearer the kingdom than when they fir&s;t believed, but many times further off; by leaning upon a formality, and not really entering into the work of God, nor tra|velling out of death into life; for there mu&s;t be a path, and a travelling in it; the &s;oul mu&s;t have an exerci&s;e thro' the power and life of Je&s;us, for the overcoming of death, that did &s;eparate from God, and a preparing for life, that life that unites us to God again: And when people are in earne&s;t in this travel, they are re&s;igned up to the go|vernment, direction and leading of him that is gone before, that hath made a way for us, and will further our progre&s;s towards the kingdom of God.</P>
<P>And, therefore, my friends, you know the way, and know how the power hath reached to you, and hath opened your under&s;tandings that you may be faithful to that power in your own &s;ouls, and may have the u&s;e and true im|provement of this, and all other &s;uch meetings as this, for the gathering of your minds out of all vi&s;ible and change|able objects, unto that life which God hath revealed, that &s;o in the exerci&s;e of it, you may hold your fellow&s;hip with God, and with one another; here is the bond of perfection, here is that in which God hath created peace and re&s;t, and joy for his people; &s;o far as every one is partaker of this innocent life, and feels him&s;elf changed into it, they are gathered into the church, and they are gathered into fellow|&s;hip with the head of it, and are comforted in their member|&s;hip, in their partaking together.</P>
<P>Though I be but a little one, yet I partake of the &s;ame virtue which the Lord admini&s;tered to the greate&s;t &s;aints, while I am a waiting upon him, and of the &s;ame divine con&s;olation, and operation, and power that weaneth more and more from the world, and that which is corruptible, and rai&s;eth up in me daily more and more fervent de&s;ires after that bread that peri&s;heth not.</P>

<P>And my friends, to this you are called, whether you are come to it or no; it is this you are called to with a heavenly call, that you might no longer live in the rudiments of the world, to be &s;eeking and looking here and there, for a ground of peace and of re&s;t; a ground of hope, but may know and feel the &s;ame thing, the &s;ame ground of eternal hope that the &s;aints of old had; what is that? what rea&s;on did they give and render of their hopes of eternal glory? The apo&s;|tle tells you plainly the ground or rea&s;on of their hope of being glorified in the world to come, was <HI>Chri&s;t in</HI> them <HI>the hope of glory.</HI> They witne&s;&s;ed that Chri&s;t gave his life for the world. Take the glorious te&s;timony that the apo&s;|tle did bear in one of his epi&s;tles; &s;aith he, <HI>the life was manife&s;ted in me;</HI> it was not covered up or hidden, that people could not find it; God was plea&s;ed to bring it to <HI>light by the go&s;pel;</HI> when a thing is brought to light, you may &s;ee it. This he affirmed in his day, and the &s;ame is affirmed in our day. The life is manife&s;ted; what life? Not the life of this world, but a life not defiled, not pol|luted, but the life that is of God, a heavenly life that is holy and pure; that life is manife&s;ted; we have &s;een it, and we exhort all to lay hold of it, to lay hold of eternal life: Some had a &s;ight of it, that had not laid hold of it; they &s;aw it in a vi&s;ion, and they might &s;ay po&s;&s;ibly, oh that I could live &s;uch a life, that there were no &s;in in me, in my words, or thoughts, or actions, what a gracious life would
<PB N="151" REF="020309_0151_0FAEF9561EC5B368">
that be! They had &s;een that life, they had ta&s;ted of it, but they did not lay hold of it, but let it go by them: Take heed of that, when you have &s;een it with open eyes. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are your eyes, for they have &s;een, and your ears, for they have heard,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t to his di&s;ciples: They &s;aw that life that was holy, harmle&s;s and undefiled. Lay hold on this life, e&s;pecially when you are thus a&s;&s;embled together, in a &s;olemn manner in the pre&s;ence of the Lord, waiting to behold it, and &s;ee it more and more di&s;covered to you, and labour to have that gathering power that will bring you to it, that you may know the &s;trength that comes by it to the &s;oul.</P>
<P>There is none of you, but what will meet with tempta|tions in this world, that will draw you into death and dark|ne&s;s, to things <HI>that are carnal, and &s;en&s;ual, and devili&s;h</HI> &s;ometimes. How &s;hall I &s;tand if I be not centered in that life that was before the world began, and before the devil was? If I labour to feel the influence of that divine power, that is able to keep me, my faith tells me &s;o: I know that power is able to keep me, if I keep in the exer|ci&s;e of it. The tru&s;t of a true believer is, that what&s;oever temptations and trials they are exerci&s;ed with, they know one already come, <HI>in whom they have tru&s;ted, who is both able and willing to deliver them.</HI> So by this means he is kept harmle&s;s, and innocent, and blamele&s;s in his life and conver|&s;ation. Thus you might be kept, if you would regard, and have re&s;pect to the life that is manife&s;ted in you.</P>
<P>Who&s;over comes to know, and feel and witne&s;s in their &s;ouls the di&s;covery and revelation of the life of Je&s;us, they know there is in it a certain dominion over that which is contrary to it; and you have many of you had expe|rience of the exerci&s;e of the power of God in your own hearts, that hath enabled you to reign over tho&s;e things, that have formerly ruled over you: That you can now &s;ub|due vain thoughts, and evil de&s;ires, that you can with|&s;tand temptations that come from without, and from with|in. Now if you could do this, and if ever you have done it, you did it by that power that God di&s;covered and reveal|ed in you from Je&s;us Chri&s;t: You had not &s;uch hold of this once, before you believed, but by believing, the word of God &s;ent it unto you; it being fixed by faith in the heart,
<PB N="152" REF="020309_0152_0FAEF957372AB610">
<HI>that faith which is of the operation of God:</HI> You could then do that which you could not do before, and forbear that which you was led away by. The&s;e experiences which God hath given you, &s;hould encourage you to hold on in your labour and travel, and engage you <HI>to grow in the grace of God, and in the knowledge of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> What&s;oever is propounded by men in the profe&s;&s;ion of re|ligion, this ought to be our de&s;ign and end, in the di&s;covery that is made to us of the life of Chri&s;t; that we may grow in it, and live in it; (indeed there is great talking of it) but we &s;hould labour to &s;hew forth the re&s;urrection of that life in us.</P>
<P>They that come to be baptized for the dead, are baptized into the death of Chri&s;t; the apo&s;tle tells you, <HI>in that he died, he died unto &s;in.</HI> There are none baptized for the dead, and made partakers of the death of Chri&s;t, but tho&s;e that died unto &s;in, as he died. Though Chri&s;t had no &s;in, yet he died unto &s;in: What u&s;e did he make of this, that Chri&s;t knew no &s;in, but yet did take our &s;in upon him? <HI>He died unto &s;in, that they which did partake of his death, might be partakers of his re&s;urrection:</HI> He liveth again, and after death ri&s;eth again.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that partake of this death unto &s;in, are crucified unto this world, and have taken up Chri&s;t's cro&s;s, and are dead to all the plea&s;ures and delights of this world, which are withered away and come to nothing. What do they live to now? To righteou&s;ne&s;s, holine&s;s, cha&s;tity, tempe|rance; the&s;e are plea&s;ant to them; the&s;e come to live to righteou&s;ne&s;s, through the power of him that loved them. This &s;hews the glory and the power of the grace of God. It is the grace of God that worketh &s;uch a change in a man or woman. They that delight in &s;in and wicked|ne&s;s, in that which is corrupt and ungodly, they have no delight in this, no delight in &s;obriety, cha&s;tity, holine&s;s, and purity of mind. In whom hath it wrought &s;uch a change? In all that are freely given up to it. Where any one is given up to that life, the grace of God hath the prai&s;e of it. This is the exaltation and prai&s;e of the power of God; &s;o that others may find by this, that they may by it come to believe, and by beliving, to be &s;aved.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="020309_0153_0FAEF9579C8EA370">Thus the go&s;pel hath gone forth, from one to many, and from the&s;e to many more, and is encrea&s;ing more and more; for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, mercy and peace, are multiplied, by which the heritage of God, and &s;o every man and woman that partake of this life, are gathered into fellow&s;hip.</P>
<P>So that your end in coming to the&s;e meetings, is not &s;o much to hear what this, and that, and the other friend faith; but what you have in your&s;elves to witne&s;s to: The divine operations of the power of God in your &s;ouls, bringing down &s;omething that is to be brought down, and rai&s;ing up &s;omething that is to be rai&s;ed. Temptation to &s;in hath more prevalency upon me, than it hath upon this, and that, and the other man. I am not come to their degree, yet it is better with me than it was at my fir&s;t convincement. If thou do&s;t &s;ay this and deceive others, cry to God, and pray earne&s;tly that all may be brought down which is contrary to his grace. If thou &s;aye&s;t and profe&s;&s;e&s;t this, to &s;trengthen that, which is known, by the light of Chri&s;t, to be again&s;t the truth of God, if at the &s;ame time there is a deceitful heart, how will this appear at the great day of God? The eye of God is upon thy hypocri&s;y; he that <HI>never &s;lumbers nor &s;leeps,</HI> he beholds thee, if there be any &s;in that thou woulde&s;t keep and &s;ave alive. If thou make&s;t a profe&s;&s;ion, and notwith&s;tanding &s;aye&s;t, this &s;in I will keep, <HI>the Lord pardon me in this thing;</HI> like <HI>Naaman,</HI> the &s;ervant of the king of <HI>A&s;&s;yria,</HI> who &s;aid to the pro|phet, <HI>thy &s;ervant henceforth will neither offer burnt offer|ing, nor &s;acrifice to other Gods, but unto the Lord. In this the Lord pardon thy &s;ervant, that when my ma&s;ter goes in|to the hou&s;e of</HI> Rimmon <HI>to wor&s;hip there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow my&s;elf in the hou&s;e of</HI> Rimmon; <HI>when I bow my&s;elf in the hou&s;e of</HI> Rimmon, <HI>the Lord pardon thy &s;ervant in this thing.</HI> He knew if he bowed not, the king would take notice of the alteration of his ge&s;ture, there|fore he would bow in the hou&s;e of <HI>Rimmon:</HI> That &s;in he would &s;ave alive under a profe&s;&s;ion: That hypocri&s;y the Lord did abominate.</P>
<P>Be upright in the &s;ight of God, and be faithful to your own &s;ouls; if it be &s;o, then every &s;in will be a burthen, and you will long to be rid of it; if it be &s;o, you know
<PB N="154" REF="020309_0154_0FAEF9585F217B80">
who&s;e hand it is that hath brought you &s;o far; if you be really cordial, and give up your&s;elves to Je&s;us, that <HI>work which he hath begun in you, he will fini&s;h for you.</HI> He will fini&s;h it for you, &s;tand out with him in nothing; give up your&s;elves to him, and join not with his enemies; take heed of hearkening to them; take heed of every &s;in that will at la&s;t be a burthen and oppre&s;&s;ion to your &s;ouls.</P>
<P>But if you live this heavenly life of Je&s;us, you will be &s;et at liberty, to have dominion over &s;in, and to &s;tand without guilt before the throne of God. Friends, let your hearts be deeply affected with the great mercies that God hath be&s;towed upon you, and for his gift to you of that divine life that <HI>is acceptable in his &s;ight.</HI></P>
<P>Many things have been done upon the account of reli|gion, and we could never be &s;atisfied whether they were acceptable to God; we could not be &s;atisfied whether we did any thing plea&s;ing to God: We may &s;ay of them as the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> did of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> &s;acrifices, <HI>there remains a con&s;cience of &s;in,</HI> an accu&s;ing con&s;cience, that tells us, that guilt is not removed, nor the &s;in taken away, till the Lord opens this divine my&s;tery to us, that our ju&s;tifica|tion mu&s;t be by faith in Je&s;us; that nothing could recon|cile us to God but the life of Je&s;us, and the merit of his death.</P>
<P>This life of Je&s;us was a holy, blamele&s;s, harmle&s;s, and innocent life, which <HI>life he gave for the world;</HI> which <HI>life is the light of men;</HI> and our &s;ouls being turned to this life, we &s;ee the glory and the excellency of it, and de|&s;ires are kindled in our hearts after it. Many have pur|&s;ued, and laboured, and travelled, that they might come to the enjoyment of it. The very di&s;covery of this life ought to be highly prized, and your &s;ouls affected with it; and when you have obtained it, you will &s;ay, O! what a ble&s;&s;ed condition am I come into! that Chri&s;t hath manife&s;ted his divine power in me, not only in <HI>reconciling me to God,</HI> but taking away the con&s;cience of &s;in; by that alone the accu&s;er is ca&s;t out, and I may now &s;ing to God, &s;ongs of deliverance. Now you ta&s;te of the mercies that God hath be&s;towed upon you; this will affect your &s;ouls with a child-like
<PB N="155" REF="020309_0155_0FAEF9591CE13040">
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and &s;ubjection to him, that hath begun to &s;ave and deliver you, that &s;o you may re&s;ign up your|&s;elves to his will, and for&s;ake the world, and the things of it.</P>
<P>Now when the&s;e come to &s;uch a meeting as this, their minds may be retired, and they may be &s;en&s;ible of the power of truth upon their hearts; but for want of keeping their &s;ubjection to the divine power, that hath opened their under&s;tandings, when they come into the world again, they are en&s;nared and entangled, and many times, for want of watchfulne&s;s, through a loo&s;ene&s;s of mind, and unru|line&s;s of tongue, they run into anger and pa&s;&s;ion, and this grieves the Holy Spirit of God. And how &s;hould you come to God through the Mediator, when you grieve his Spirit, and quench the motions of it.</P>
<P>The&s;e things have been hurtful to many, that in their time might have been pillars in the hou&s;e of God. Take heed of this, and let the goodne&s;s of God dwell upon your minds, that you may feel and experience the inward admini|&s;trations of it; there are many that are much affected with the outward mini&s;try, and are very de&s;irous to hear the &s;ervants of God declare the things that God hath wrought for them, and in them, and the wonderful things that God hath opened to them; yet when you have heard all that man can &s;ay about it, if the divine mini&s;try of the word of God doth not make powerful impre&s;&s;ions upon you, and &s;anctify and renew your &s;ouls, the outward mini&s;try of the word will do you no good.</P>
<P>Now that you may be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the truth that you have been taught, this te&s;timony ari&s;eth in me, to de&s;ire every one to heed and attend to the manife&s;tation of this life of Je&s;us in your&s;elves. What&s;oever God hath be&s;tow|ed upon me or another, you may peri&s;h for all that, and I am not the better for what God hath be&s;towed upon you, but may peri&s;h notwith&s;tanding; but that God hath manife&s;ted eternal life to my &s;oul, let that be every ones centre: This will make you holy and blamele&s;s, and pre|&s;erve you in every &s;tate, and in the hour of temptation, and in the mid&s;t of &s;nares; this will be a bulwark to you; this will be as the walls of Zion, which is the &s;alvation of the Lord. That &s;o you may be pre&s;erved &s;en&s;ible of
<PB N="156" REF="020309_0156_0FAEF959E4885738">
the goodne&s;s of the Lord: That grace, mercy, and peace may be multiplied in your bo&s;oms; this will make you dear and affectionate one to another.</P>
<P>Though there may be an external fellow&s;hip among tho&s;e that preach and profe&s;s the &s;ame doctrine, yet when they come off from that, when once men depart from the power of truth, they grow &s;tubborn and rebellious; but when men come to be gathered into the inward fellow&s;hip that &s;tands not in terms and words, but in the revelation of Chri&s;t, and in the participation of his virtue and goodne&s;s; the more you are united in this, the more you are knit one to another, and become u&s;eful and helpful one to another.</P>
<P>The Lord vouch&s;afe to every one of you a ta&s;te of his goodne&s;s, and you will prefer it above all that the devil has, and his in&s;truments can pre&s;ent; and if you re|tire more into this heavenly and divine life of Je&s;us, you will feel and enjoy more peace and &s;atisfaction, and true con&s;olation in your &s;ouls, than I, or any man in the world can tell you of.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Preached at GRACE-CHURCH-STREET, <DATE>July 26, 1691.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>YOU have read and heard much concerning the day of the Lord, as a great and notable day; many of you are now living witne&s;&s;es that the great and not|able day of the Lord is coming, in which the accompli&s;h|ment of great and notable things, the mighty works of God, which have been prophe&s;ied of, may be lawfully expected. It is the work of every Chri&s;tian to wait upon the Lord in the light of this day, and to be acquainted with the works of the Lord, both inwardly and outwardly; for the day of the Lord is a day of power, and that power of God work|eth wonderful things; and if we are not kept in the light of that day, the Lord may work great things, and we not
<PB N="157" REF="020309_0157_0FAEF95AA7C7FD90">
know it; we &s;hall be looked upon as carele&s;s and negligent witne&s;&s;es of the works of the Lord, as tho&s;e that do not regard them. If you would be faithful witne&s;&s;es, you mu&s;t have regard to the works of the Lord, and the operations of his hands. One that is minded to be a faithful witne&s;s, he will take notice of what is &s;aid and done; you are called to be witne&s;&s;es of the works of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and of his doings; you mu&s;t &s;tand where you may hear, and &s;ee, and under&s;tand what the Lord is about to do at this time.</P>
<P>In te&s;timony and witne&s;s bearing, the greate&s;t thing we have to expect in this day of the Lord, is, that God will &s;et up the kingdom of his Son Chri&s;t Je&s;us; and unto this all the prophets did bear witne&s;s in their time, and now it is our turn to bear witne&s;s of it, by &s;en&s;ible and living experiences of the accompli&s;hment of tho&s;e things that they prophe&s;ied of, that the Lord will &s;et up the kingdom of Chri&s;t, and bring down and lay wa&s;te the kingdom of Anti|chri&s;t. This our Saviour taught his di&s;ciples to pray for&punc; more than &s;ixteen hundred years ago, that the kingdom of God might come; and all the true di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t ever &s;ince have prayed for the coming of this kingdom, and many of them have &s;een the coming of it, and rejoiced; and others have died in the faith of it, and have been gathered into the kingdom of Heaven.</P>
<P>But, my friends, that which chiefly concerns us at this day, is to behold the kingdom of Chri&s;t, the eternal Son of God, within us, to go forward and pro&s;per; and the kingdom of Antichri&s;t &s;uppre&s;&s;ed and de&s;troyed, and utterly laid wa&s;te; and this is wrought two ways, fir&s;t, inwardly; &s;econd, outwardly.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, inwardly; there is a great inclination in the minds of people, to look more at the operation of God's power in this great work outwardly, than to look at it inwardly, but unto that there mu&s;t be a daily cro&s;s taken up, and it is my bu&s;ine&s;s at this time to tell you in the name of the Lord, that your duty and mine is to turn our minds to the working of the power of God in our&s;elves, and to &s;ee that other kingdom of the man of &s;in weakened and brought down within us; then there is no fear but he will carry on his work outwardly, and we &s;hall &s;ee as much
<PB N="158" REF="020309_0158_0FAEF95BA5E54758">
of that work as belongs to our generation; but the great matter and chief government of you and me, is to &s;ee the kingdom of God &s;et up within us, which &s;tands in holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s: Our bu&s;ine&s;s is to walk till we &s;ee the righteou&s;ne&s;s of this kingdom &s;et up within us, in our hearts and &s;ouls, and to have a real change made.</P>
<P>We all know, and we mu&s;t confe&s;s, that we have been &s;ubject to the man of &s;in, what&s;oever we are now. We have &s;een the reign and government, the rage and tyranny of the wicked one, that hath led us into rebellion and di&s;|obedience to the Lord our Maker. How do we like that government, to be ruled by the devil, and to be led cap|tive, and to be made to do his will, and to rebel again&s;t God that gave us our life, and breath, and being? How do we like the government of &s;atan? I hope we do none of us like it. It was &s;o with me; and they that are un|der the tyrannical government of &s;atan, have many cries and wi&s;hes in their &s;ouls, that they were freed and deli|vered from it, and brought under the government and obedience of Chri&s;t Je&s;us; and that they were able to &s;erve God as they ought to do, that they might be tran&s;|lated from the kingdom of &s;in and &s;atan, into the king|dom of the ble&s;&s;ed and dearly beloved Son of God.</P>
<P>This hath been the cry of &s;ome ever &s;ince they have known the word; and I am per&s;uaded it is the cry of many at this day. I have good news to bring you; not that the day of your redemption draws nigh, but that it is come; the day of redemption is now come, and there are a great many ble&s;&s;ing and glorifying the name of God that they are redeemed, and delivered from the bondage of corruption; and have more joy and delight in the &s;er|vice of God, that made them, than ever they had in the &s;ervice of the God of this world.</P>
<P>But may not &s;ome &s;ay, how &s;hall this great work be wrought? For it is a great work, and we verily think that nothing but an Almighty Power can effect it. For there are many in this a&s;&s;embly have been trying to no purpo&s;e, and done what they could in their own &s;trength, to deliver their own &s;ouls from death, and yet they find them&s;elves in bondage &s;till; nay, they have called in the

help and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e that they thought to be &s;tronger than them&s;elves, and all have failed, and they are yet weak and entangled, and they cannot find them&s;elves at liberty to &s;erve the Lord as they ought to do.</P>
<P>I am of this mind, that nothing but the Almighty Power of God can do it; and when you have come to my ex|perience, to know this as I have done, then I hope you will &s;eek after that, and you will &s;ee good rea&s;on for it; and you will then come to this profe&s;&s;ion, if the Lord puts not forth his Almighty Power, I mu&s;t then peri&s;h, for there is no other power can deliver me. When you come to know this, what mu&s;t you do? Why you mu&s;t wait for the revelation of that power that will take you off from all tru&s;t and confidence that you have ever had in any thing el&s;e: A man that hath nothing to tru&s;t to but the Almighty Power, and mercy, and goodne&s;s of God, he puts his whole tru&s;t and confidenee therein, or el&s;e he knows he mu&s;t peri&s;h.</P>
<P>When a man or woman comes to this pa&s;s, that they have nothing to rely upon but the Lord, then they will meet together to wait upon the Lord: And this was the fir&s;t ground or motive of our &s;etting up meet|ings; and I would to God that this was the u&s;e that every one would make of them that come to them, then they would be ju&s;tly and properly u&s;ed, according to the end of the in&s;titution of them at fir&s;t; we &s;hould u&s;e them as poor de&s;olate helple&s;s people that are brok|en off from all their own confidence and tru&s;t, and have nothing to rely upon but the mercy and goodne&s;s of God; and if he plea&s;eth to reveal his power among us, we know that he is able to &s;ave us. And when we have met with the revelation of God's power, and we have met to|gether in &s;implicity of mind, the Lord was plea&s;ed to com|municate his Spirit to us, and open a door for us, and di&s;cover and reveal to us that it was the day of his power: And when we came to examine our&s;elves whether we were willing in this day of God's power (for the prophet gives us a note of di&s;tinction between the people of God, and other people; <HI>thy people &s;hall be willing in the day of thy power;</HI> which is as much as to &s;ay, when God di&s;covers and
<PB N="160" REF="020309_0160_0FAEF95CCA24F450">
reveals his power to them, &s;uch a people are willing to give them&s;elves over to the government of it; when we found we were &s;ubject to it, we had joy in believing, before we attained the end of our hope; it was gladne&s;s to us we found our&s;elves willing; and I am per&s;uaded that every one of you would be glad to find your&s;elves willing to part with that which you cry out again&s;t.</P>
<P>What a cry is there of our bondage and corruption, and of our being led captive by our lu&s;ts. We may hear &s;uch a cry from one end of the kindgom to the other: People cry out of the bondage of corruption, and of their &s;ubjection to &s;in and &s;atan: I would they were in earne&s;t; there is not that earne&s;tne&s;s and reality in men and women that God looks for, and &s;o there comes nothing of it. There is no redemption, and no deliverance; the Lord doth not hear them, though they come now a-days into his pre&s;ence, to offer up their prayers. I would have you to be in good earne&s;t, I wi&s;h well to you all; and it would be hard to &s;ay that you do not wi&s;h well to your|&s;elves. Here lies your welfare, that you find your&s;elves willing to be &s;ubject to the power that made you; you have been &s;ubject doubtle&s;s to the power that de&s;troyed you; that power that never gave you life and breath, and would be in&s;trumental of your de&s;truction: The power of the God of this world never did men good, but de&s;troyed them, deceived them, and deprived them of their lives.</P>
<P>Now if there was but a willingne&s;s in every one of us, freely to give up our&s;elves to that power that created us, to obey his will, I am &s;ure there is never a man or wo|man among us &s;hould long be without the knowledge of it. If I am but willing to be &s;ubject to the law of him that made me, it will not be long before he di&s;cover it to me, and reveal his power in me in the glory and excellency of it; that power which is more able to pre&s;erve me, than all the power of men on earth, or all the power of the devils in hell is able to de&s;troy me. When the Lord &s;hall di&s;cover and reveal his power in you, you will be willing to be &s;ubject to it.</P>
<P>But methinks the &s;ound and noi&s;e of fle&s;h and blood grows loud here: I would be &s;ubject to God, but I would
<PB N="161" REF="020309_0161_0FAEF95DE84134D0">
not have him cro&s;s mine intere&s;t, and deprive me of that I love and thir&s;t after; I would not have him imbitter my carnal delights and plea&s;ures, and undo me as to my reputation in the world.</P>
<P>You may &s;ee whence this comes, that you would make a bargain, and draw a contract with the God of your lives about the&s;e things; this is a non&s;en&s;ical thing; becau&s;e of all people in the world, you are a people that have had a veneration for the holy &s;criptures, the &s;criptures of truth, and have been acquainted with them as familiarly as with any book in the world, wherein you find articles drawn, long ago fixed and &s;ealed; and no new ones are to be drawn. If any one will be my di&s;ciple, <HI>John</HI> or <HI>Thomas, James</HI> or <HI>Peter,</HI> or who&s;oever he be, he mu&s;t take up his daily cro&s;s, and deny him&s;elf, and follow me. Now here is a con|tract made, therefore turn a&s;ide from all kind of rea&s;on|ing and con&s;ulting with fle&s;h and blood.</P>
<P>If you will become &s;piritual, and partake of &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings and benefits, I would advi&s;e you to turn from all kind of rea&s;onings that come from the pit of dark|ne&s;s, that hath thus far deceived you, and will ruin you forever, if you hearken to them. For a&s;&s;ure your&s;elves, new go&s;pel-terms no man can make; and if any come to preach new go&s;pel-terms, count him a deceiver; for there is no po&s;&s;ibility of being a di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t, but by tak|ing up a daily cro&s;s, and denying our&s;elves, and follow|ing him as our leader and guide. To him I mu&s;t go, and go in no other way, &s;peaking nothing, and doing nothing but what is holy and pure; he mu&s;t conduct me in my walking, guide me in my way, and ju&s;tify me in it. This is to be a true di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he comes to adhere, and join to the power of God revealed in his &s;oul, he &s;ees the coming of the kingdom of God; he &s;ees it at a di&s;tance; he &s;aith within him&s;elf, and makes this conclu&s;ion, I will follow my cap|tain; I will become &s;ubject to the kingdom of Chri&s;t. If I obey this divine principle of the grace of God, and the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, I &s;hall be his di&s;ciple. I read in his ble&s;&s;ed book, <HI>that as many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the children of God.</HI> I am not to propo&s;e new
<PB N="162" REF="020309_0162_0FAEF95E87FEFB58">
terms, but to accept of the old terms of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. I &s;ee that the kingdom of God is to be &s;et up, and the kingdom of the devil to be brought down in me; if I follow this divine principle, I &s;hall never follow the devil more; if he would have me lye, I &s;hall refu&s;e, and &s;ay I cannot; if he would have me run into vain and corrupt communication, and fooli&s;h je&s;ting, that will be a bridle to me, that I cannot do it.</P>
<P>I &s;peak now to per&s;ons that live under the light of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and that are &s;ubdued by his grace; I would &s;peak that which all the logic in the world cannot overthrow; that which the mo&s;t cunning logician, with all his wit and quirks, cannot refute and prove erroneous. If a man be led by the Spirit of God, he cannot lye; this is a common cure for all men; if I be led by the Spirit of Truth, and hearken to the principle of truth in my own &s;oul, this will cure and heal me of the wounds and maladies of my corrupt nature, and &s;et me at liberty from my old ma&s;ter; I do not like his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>I hope if any of you like the &s;ervitude and bondage of &s;in and &s;atan, you will de&s;ire liberty before you die: Why do not you de&s;ire it now? It may be thou thinke&s;t to enjoy a little liberty, and reputation, and plea&s;ure in &s;in for many years, for &s;ix or &s;even, nine or ten years, and then break off from it, and repent and turn to God: How do&s;t thou know that thou ha&s;t ten days to live? It is of high concernment to every one of us to wait for a di&s;covery of go&s;pel liberty, and an ability and power in his &s;oul, to enable him to break off from the &s;ervitude and bondage of &s;in and &s;atan, that he hath &s;o long lived under; and to wait upon God with patience, for the &s;etting his &s;oul at liberty, and &s;etting up the kingdom of Chri&s;t within him, and pulling down the kingdom of &s;atan, that he may be brought into the kingdom of Chri&s;t, that con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>peace and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> The&s;e are the things that follow one another; when righteou&s;ne&s;s is &s;et up in me, I &s;hall not be di&s;turbed, I &s;hall have peace; and if I have peace I &s;hall have joy, and this joy is in the Holy Gho&s;t; the apo&s;tle &s;aith the kingdom of God con&s;i&s;ts in the&s;e things.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="020309_0163_0FAEF960B64D3EC0">Now that every one might be per&s;uaded that God hath given a mea&s;ure of his grace to them, as well as to other folks, let them con&s;ider and &s;ay within them&s;elves, God hath not &s;hut me out of the number of his people: He hath knocked at the door of my heart, to bring me to re|pentance; he hath waited upon me &s;o long, &s;urely he hath a mind to &s;ave me: Would he call upon me, had he not intended I &s;hould repent and turn to him?</P>
<P>But where is the power? you will &s;ay; knocking at the door of the heart, and checks of con&s;cience, we under&s;tand them; but we under&s;tand not where the power is, to be conformable to the will of God.</P>
<P>People will never under&s;tand it while they are in the kingdom of &s;atan, and under the power of the prince of darkne&s;s; the apo&s;tle tells us, <HI>that the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not, le&s;t the light of the glorious go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, who is the image of God, &s;hould &s;hine upon them.</HI> If men &s;aw the beauty of the go&s;pel, they would run after it, and embrace it; therefore the devil blinds their minds, that they &s;hould not &s;ee the beauty and amiablene&s;s of the go&s;pel, and like the terms of it: He hath the rule and government of the children of di&s;obe|dience. So long as I live in &s;ubjection to that devili&s;h, hel|li&s;h power, which leads me forth into &s;in, I &s;hall be a &s;tranger to God's power, that would enable me to break off from it.</P>
<P>You never read in &s;cripture of any that ever came to be &s;aved by the power of God, but there was faith mixed with it, that came to join with that power of God. Our Saviour &s;aid to the impotent man, <HI>thy faith hath made thee whole;</HI> thy faith joining with that power of God: <HI>We &s;hall be made &s;trong in the Lord, and in the power of his might,</HI> and be able to with&s;tand temptations.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the &s;oul of man joins with the grace of God, he doth for&s;ake the &s;ervice of his old ma&s;ter and governor: Sin &s;hall no longer have dominion over him; though he may meet with the &s;ame temptation, it &s;hall not have the &s;ame power over him, but he will be enabled by the grace of God to with&s;tand it, and overcome it. If you ask &s;uch a man, how it is that he overcomes that temptation that formerly
<PB N="164" REF="020309_0164_0FAEF9614C02F768">
prevailed over him, he will tell you, I have now an helper, I am now joined to the grace of God in my &s;oul, therefore do I with&s;tand temptations, and have power over them. Thus comes the kingdom of Chri&s;t to be &s;et up in the &s;oul, and this is that which will &s;it and prepare us for the everla&s;t|ing kingdom of God. They that do wait upon God, &s;hall &s;ee this work wrought inwardly in them, they know more by faith than they can &s;ee by &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>I know, and am certain, that the power the devil hath in the world, &s;hall be broken down, and righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall be exalted, and ju&s;tice and equity &s;hall prevail in the nations. I &s;hall not perhaps live to &s;ee it, but I may &s;ee it by faith; I have &s;een enough for my generation, and they that live in the next generation, &s;hall &s;ee it al&s;o; for the church of God is the &s;ame from one generation to another. Now unto us it is given to &s;ee the things that in former generations were prophe&s;ied of, God having (&s;aith the apo&s;tle) <HI>provided &s;ome better thing for us, that they without us &s;hall not be made perfect.</HI></P>
<P>The church of God from one generation to another, have their mea&s;ure and degree of &s;ervice, and bear their proper te&s;timony, and leave the re&s;t to &s;ucceeding generations: It concerns us in our generation to &s;ee a change made inwardly in our &s;ouls, and the kingdom of Chri&s;t &s;et up within us, and the kingdom of &s;atan brought down in our&s;elves. This doth not concern my &s;on or grand&s;on only, but it concerns me, and when they grow up to mature age, in their time it will concern them: Therefore that which is mo&s;t profitable to us, is, that we have &s;uch a &s;tation, and &s;tand in &s;uch a place in our time, where we may &s;ee the work of God car|ried on.</P>
<P>I have con&s;idered, many a time, that there are many brave men and women in this age, that might have been eminent witne&s;&s;es of God in this world, and borne their te&s;|timony to his truth, but their faith hath been weak and in|effectual: They have di&s;covered their unbelieving hearts, and have joined with the common herd of the world, be|cau&s;e they thought &s;uch great things could never be done, that the kingdom of &s;atan could never be pulled down and de&s;troyed, and the kingdom of Chri&s;t &s;et up within us,
<PB N="165" REF="020309_0165_0FAEF96359797430">
but I would hope better things of you, things that accom|pany &s;alvation; and that he that hath begun a good work in you, will carry it on to perfection, that living prai&s;es, and joyful thank&s;givings, may be rendered to him who alone is worthy, who is God over all, ble&s;&s;ed forever; to whom be glory and dominion forever, and ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SERMON XV. <HI>The</HI> UNDEFILED WAY <HI>to</HI> ETERNAL REST.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Preached at DEVONSHIRE-HOUSE, <DATE>July 29, 1691.</DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Lord will be with all his people, that are unde|filed in the way, that are &s;piritual travellers walk|ing in that undefiled way, that leads to an undefiled re&s;t. There are &s;ome that by this way are entered into re&s;t, that re&s;t which God hath prepared for them. We cannot apply to our&s;elves that promi&s;e that is made to us of <HI>enter|ing into re&s;t,</HI> unle&s;s we be real and true travellers in the way that leads to it, for if we do, <HI>we deceive our own &s;ouls.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore you that have had a &s;ight and vi&s;ion of the way everla&s;ting, that leads unto a holy re&s;t, you are an engag|ed people to make &s;trait &s;teps therein, and to have it your daily care, and make it your continual bu&s;ine&s;s, to look that your goings and foot-&s;teps are of the &s;ame nature and kind that the re&s;t is that you de&s;ire to enter into: For it is an undefiled re&s;t, that we all are, or ought to be travelling after; therefore every one of us mu&s;t be undefiled in the way, and every foot-&s;tep mu&s;t be of the &s;ame kind and nature, and &s;eparate from all that which defileth it and pol|luteth it; that &s;o it may have a tendency to the bringing of the &s;oul nearer to its re&s;t.</P>
<P>This holy re&s;t many travellers have attained by this holy travel, and many are &s;till in hope to attain it.</P>
<P>But now they that are full of hope of attaining this re&s;t, their foot-&s;teps and goings are not of the &s;ame nature and
<PB N="166" REF="020309_0166_0FAEF96445894C20">
kind; they are not holy and pure, they are not undefiled; The&s;e have not their faces truly <HI>Zion</HI>-ward, though the face of their profe&s;&s;ion may &s;tand that way; but the Lord looks at the heart of every one, and he knows which way the heart &s;tands, they who have their hearts truly turned to the Lord, they have the mark of holine&s;s in their eye, and the mark of purity and righteou&s;ne&s;s in all their undertakings, becau&s;e they know there is no attaining to that divine re&s;t, but by a holy way and travel; therefore their tru&s;t and re|liance is alone on the Lord, that is to keep them in all their way; for if they be ever &s;o clearly convinced that holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s is their duty, and is the way whereby they may attain to the kingdom of God, though they are ever &s;o fully convinced of it, yet there lies an impo&s;&s;ibility of any walking therein without the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the grace of God; for though they have been convinced by the appear|ance of his grace, and have had a light that openeth to them a &s;ight of the&s;e things, it is not this &s;ight and vi&s;ion that will enable them <HI>to run the race that is &s;et before them.</HI></P>
<P>For the manifold impurities and hindrances which are in our way, between our coming out of Egypt's land, the bondage of corruption, and our entering into the kingdom of God, are too mighty and too great for any man with his knowledge and &s;trength to overcome. The children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> might as well have gone through the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> without the help of God, as the Chri&s;tian traveller can go through the many difficulties, and the many impediments that he is to meet with in his way, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God's Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>My friends, it hath been a labour and travel at this time upon my mind, that all whom God hath &s;o &s;ignally ble&s;&s;ed with the knowledge of the truth, that you may &s;ee your way, and mo&s;t clearly know and under&s;tand, that your way leads to life eternal; that all and every one of you in your par|ticular meetings, are to have a dependence upon that which can help you in your way.</P>
<P>For I have &s;een too many that have had a wrong de|pendence, after they were rightly convinced, and after they have had a true knowledge of their way wherein they &s;hould walk; they have too much tru&s;ted to openings and &s;ights
<PB N="167" REF="020309_0167_0FAEF9645D98C070">
which they have received; they have thought their moun|tain &s;o &s;ure, and that their <HI>feet have been pa&s;t &s;liding,</HI> that there hath grown up a &s;tate of pre&s;umption, that they have thought they &s;hould never turn a&s;ide, and have not had due regard to the renewing of the Divine Power of God in their &s;ouls, that God's children always mu&s;t have. They have (as I may &s;o &s;ay) forgotten what our Lord &s;aid, <HI>with|out me ye can do nothing:</HI> They have pa&s;&s;ed a &s;entence up|on that doctrine in their minds, and they have thought they could do &s;omething; that they could with&s;tand temptation; that they could do &s;ome work for God, and &s;ervice to God, without the Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance of that power that did beget them; and alas! the lea&s;t they have &s;u&s;tained hath been, that they have run into evil, and they have defiled their way, and run into temptations, though it hath plea&s;ed the Lord, who&s;e mercy is infinite, to pull them many times back again out of the &s;nare which they were fallen into, and to take them again, and to wa&s;h them, and clean&s;e them, and purify them, and &s;et their feet on a &s;ure place. This was more than they de&s;erved; but his mercy, and goodne&s;s, and tenderne&s;s, is over all his works.</P>
<P>This he hath wrought for many a one; and not only once, but many times; it is hard venturing; it had been better if &s;uch a one had never fallen, or that their foot|&s;teps had never &s;lid from the ways of the Lord, than after <HI>they are fallen, to be renewed again by repentance.</HI> It hath cau&s;ed &s;ore judgment, and condemnation, and anxi|ety of &s;pirit; and they have given their old enemy an ad|vantage to whi&s;per in their ears; thou ha&s;t lo&s;t thy ground; thy &s;ins are gone over thy head, and thou &s;halt never find repentance. The&s;e are the words of the wicked one, who &s;eeks occa&s;ion again&s;t us; and through our carele&s;ne&s;s, and not being watchful, we put an advantage into his hands. Now &s;eeing you know he is vigilant, and &s;eeks occa&s;ion that he may turn you out of your way, before you attain to the end of it, you ought to be vigilant to keep occa|&s;ions from him.</P>
<P>But &s;ome may &s;ay, how may I keep occa&s;ions and ad|vantages from the enemy? I an&s;wer, the way hath been often told you, and I dare &s;ay mo&s;t of you have tried it,
<PB N="168" REF="020309_0168_0FAEF965080A3E28">
and found it to be true, that &s;o long as you have re|mained in a watchful &s;tate and po&s;ture, and have had your minds exerci&s;ed by the grace of God, by which you were convinced of your &s;in, and by which your duty was ma|nife&s;ted to you, &s;o long you gave the enemy of your &s;ouls no occa&s;ion; but the truth pre&s;erved you wherein you tru&s;ted, and wherein you hoped and waited for the vir|tue and power of it. Did you find want of ability then? Did the enemy prevail then? He did not cea&s;e to tempt when you was in the mo&s;t watchful &s;tate of a Chri&s;tian; the devil did not then cea&s;e to tempt you, but you found in you a power that re&s;i&s;ted him, and &s;aid, <HI>get thee be|hind me, &s;atan.</HI></P>
<P>So long as you are upon your watch; &s;o far as you keep your mind fixed upon the Divine Power, &s;o long you are in a &s;ure place; and who&s;oever turns a&s;ide from this, they &s;uffer great harm and prejudice; and if ever they be re&s;tored again, it is with lo&s;s and damage, and &s;ore exer|ci&s;e; and if they be not re&s;tored, they are lo&s;t to all eter|nity: <HI>Then it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteou&s;ne&s;s, than after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.</HI> And then they &s;aid within them&s;elves, this mu&s;t be the way.</P>
<P>Sirs, the&s;e things pertain to your everla&s;ting welfare; I &s;peak to you as a people that God hath abundantly loved; and it hath been far beyond any thing of de&s;ert. He hath made known his ways to you; the Lord may &s;ay, con|cerning you of this city, as of old, <HI>what could I have done more for my vineyard, that I have not done?</HI> So he may &s;ay concerning you, what could I have done more to make them a grown people, a holy people, an entire people, that <HI>they may bear my name, and walk before me in holi|ne&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, all the days of their lives?</HI> What &s;hould have been done more for them?</P>
<P>But this is an exerci&s;e to us, whom God hath ble&s;&s;ed, and &s;et as watchmen, to behold and &s;ee the &s;tate of his people, and to feel and bear the burdens that are to be borne; and this is a great burden, that after all that God hath done, and that we do in the hands of God, all that is nece&s;&s;ary for the welfare of the people, there are &s;ome
<PB N="169" REF="020309_0169_0FAEF965CA46CC60">
that turn a&s;ide, and defile their way; and we te&s;tify in the name of the Lord, that who&s;oever walks in a de|filed way, &s;hall never come to an undefiled re&s;t; therefore that you do not attain to that undefiled re&s;t, it is becau&s;e ye have been defiled: Seeing the holy conver&s;ation of the people of God is the effect of the working of his own power and Spirit.</P>
<P>Here comes the re&s;t, by and through a Mediator, even Je&s;us Chri&s;t the righteous, who is the Mediator between God and man, and the leader of all his people in the way of holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, which he hath made manife&s;t to them that believe and obey the power: And <HI>he hath purcha&s;ed eternal &s;alvation for all that believe and obey the go&s;pel:</HI> But the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors do not obey the go&s;pel; the Spirit of Chri&s;t doth not lead you to tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; and the power and light that comes from Chri&s;t, doth not lead you to pride, vanity, envy and bitterne&s;s: Wherever the&s;e things are led into, there is another &s;pirit, and that other &s;pirit hath another tendency, it leads into the wrath of God.</P>
<P>And my friends, this is that which my &s;oul de&s;ireth at your hands, and it is for your good and advantage; it is my duty to di&s;charge my con&s;cience, and to &s;peak plainly as the Lord &s;hall give me utterance, to warn you that you abide in the truth; for if &s;o be you be not &s;aved, but will turn a&s;ide after your own hearts lu&s;ts, after your pride and the vanity of the world, and the lu&s;ts thereof, you may blame your&s;elves, and your <HI>iniquity will be your ruin.</HI> We that have given up our&s;elves to God for your &s;akes, and the churches &s;ake, we &s;peak the&s;e things which we have learned of God, and we earne&s;tly pre&s;s you that are con|vinced, that you walk in the truth which you have believed: There is no great need of more knowledge, and of the vi&s;ion of heavenly and divine things; for abundance of you have &s;een more of the things of God, than ever you have travelled and come up into. I would to God, that every one of you that are convinced, would come up <HI>to the mea|&s;ure of the knowledge you have received.</HI> O! that you would an&s;wer the Lord's power, in opening and di&s;covering his mind and will concerning your travel, and the things that belong to his everla&s;ting peace, that your foot-&s;teps
<PB N="170" REF="020309_0170_0FAEF966C9F8EEC8">
may be directed thereby. If you will walk in this unde|filed way, you may lay down at night, and ri&s;e in the morning with peace, and in the favour of the Lord, and have the an&s;wer of a good con&s;cience in his &s;ight.</P>
<P>The means that mu&s;t help and conduct us in this way, mu&s;t be that familiar conver&s;e that the &s;oul mu&s;t have with &s;omething greater than it&s;elf; the familiar conver&s;e that the &s;oul mu&s;t have with the Divine Power, with that manife&s;tation of Divine Light and Grace, which, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, God hath given unto you. For if a man prize and e&s;teem the truth ever &s;o much, and &s;uffer ever &s;o much for it, and love the mini&s;ter ever &s;o much, if he keep not a familiar conver&s;e with the truth, notwith|&s;tanding all his profe&s;&s;ion of love to the truths of the go&s;pel, and the preachers of it, he will reproach it: Though he profe&s;&s;es and &s;ays, I love thee, I love thee; though he hath &s;uffered much in the way, yet if he love not the truth in his own heart, and de&s;ire not to feel the excellency and virtue of it, that man will certainly di&s;honour the truth, and grieve the Holy Spirit of God.</P>
<P>We warn you to take heed of your way, and to your feet in your Chri&s;tian walk, that you may come to have an <HI>abundant entrance into the kingdom of God.</HI> Pray to God that the work of regeneration may be wrought upon you, that you may be born into another &s;eed, and partake of the divine nature: Then, though the devil a&s;&s;ault you, he cannot overcome you; he will find nothing in you whereby to betray you into his hands, when that change is wrought, and when God hath made an alteration, and hath brought you out of the love of the world, and the love of earthly things, <HI>and &s;et your affections above, where Chri&s;t &s;its at the right hand of God.</HI> Now you can &s;ay, here comes a temptation with this in&s;trument, and the other in&s;trument, and the devil lays things before me that he would have me to do, but I have no inclination to it, I have no mind to be &s;ucking at the world's brea&s;ts; but my mind is &s;et upon this, that I may reach acquaintance with God, <HI>who will be a pre&s;ent help to me, and tread down &s;atan under my feet.</HI></P>
<P>There is need of your continual care and vigilancy, and
<PB N="171" REF="020309_0171_0FAEF96751391690">
that you watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. It is not &s;o ea&s;y a thing for a man or wo|man while they are in this world to do any thing with|out &s;in; but God hath called you to a holy profe&s;&s;ion; which is, that you &s;hould do all you can do, to do every thing you do without &s;in: <HI>For whether you eat or drink, or what&s;oever you do, you &s;hould do all to the glory of God.</HI> This &s;pirit we would have in you, and we would have all you <HI>that have received Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Lord, to walk in him as you have received him:</HI> Then you &s;hall be kept undefiled in the way, and delivered from temptation.</P>
<P>To this end you mu&s;t be &s;till, waiting upon the Lord, that you may have acquaintance with him from day to day; you are in the world, but you &s;hould not be of the world: The prayer of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to his heavenly Father for his di&s;ciples, was not that he &s;hould <HI>take them out of the world, but keep them from the evil.</HI></P>
<P>Merchants, trade&s;men, and &s;hop-keepers, have always &s;omething to do in the world, but they &s;hould pray ear|ne&s;tly that they may <HI>be kept from the evil of the world.</HI> There is nothing can be done in the world, but there is evil in it, which we &s;hall be overcome by, if we do not keep our watch. In the government of a family, there are occa&s;ions and provocations given to be pa&s;&s;ionate and furious; many occa&s;ions are given to men and women; but we &s;hould not be tran&s;ported and overcome: Our pro|fe&s;&s;ion obliges us, that when a child or a &s;ervant gives a provocation, we are not to behave our&s;elves un&s;eemly, and unbecoming our holy profe&s;&s;ion; for it is not in their power, nor in the devil's power either, to kindle your wrath and anger into a flame: If you are upon your watch, and wait upon the Lord, he will give you wi&s;dom and &s;trength to &s;tand again&s;t all temptations what&s;oever, and <HI>to order your conver&s;ation according to the will of God, and as becomes the go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>In merchandize, buying and &s;elling, there are &s;nares, and there is evil we may run into; but this is our comfort and joy, there is no coercion, we cannot be forced to &s;in, the devil can only lay a temptation before me; if thou wilt tell a lye, equivocate, di&s;&s;emble, here is an advantage
<PB N="172" REF="020309_0172_0FAEF968A3A10C48">
for thee; but the devil with all his &s;ubtilty, power and allurements, cannot &s;ay, thou &s;halt run into this &s;in, and be overcome by this temptation; for though of our&s;elves we can do nothing, yet in the name and &s;trength of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>we can do all things;</HI> we can do that which is ju&s;t, and &s;tand over the temptation, and tram|ple upon it, and <HI>not be overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</HI> When we have bought and &s;old, we may look back upon what we have done with pure minds, and clean con&s;ciences in the &s;ight of God, and we may come off victors, and <HI>more than conquerors</HI> (over temptations) <HI>through Je&s;us Chri&s;t that hath loved us.</HI></P>
<P>The more a Chri&s;tian keeps him&s;elf un&s;potted, and the more watchful he is in his walking, he may go on from day to day, and &s;ee the &s;nares of the devil, that lies in this vanity, and this and the other vanity and temptation, and yet e&s;cape it.</P>
<P>I would I could &s;ay of &s;ome of you, that when the devil laid a &s;nare for you, you did not run into it when you &s;aw it. I have known &s;ome that have had under|&s;tanding enough, that they need not be told where the &s;nare of the devil lies; yet &s;o hath it been, the devil and their own hearts lu&s;ts have agreed together, and they have run into the &s;nare. This is from the old confede|racy that men have had with God's enemies; <HI>you are my friends,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>if you do what&s;oever I command you.</HI> If you are the friends of Chri&s;t, you will be his &s;ubjects, and yield obedience to him; when he &s;hews them a &s;nare they will keep out of it: This is the proof of a true Chri&s;tian, that he will be true in a time of trial, and will tru&s;t in that divine power that keeps him out of the &s;nare.</P>
<P>One thing more I would &s;ay, that divine fellow&s;hip that you have with Chri&s;t Je&s;us, it con&s;i&s;ts in holine&s;s of life and conver&s;ation, and the exerci&s;e of a good con&s;cience towards God, and towards man. It is in vain to tell me that you will walk in unity with the truth, unle&s;s you have unity with the truth in your own hearts; you cannot de|ceive the Lord, nor long deceive his people either. Here is the fellow&s;hip that you are to live in all your days, to live
<PB N="173" REF="020309_0173_0FAEF9690665E0E0">
in fellow&s;hip with the people of God, and communion of &s;aints; can the &s;aints have communion in any thing but holine&s;s? and holine&s;s is a ble&s;&s;ed, &s;acred thing, <HI>it becomes the hou&s;e of God forever;</HI> they that are &s;aints, are &s;anctified and made holy; and <HI>he that &s;anctifieth, and they that are &s;anctified, are all of one; for which cau&s;e, he is not a&s;hamed to call them brethren,</HI> Heb. ii. 11. They that are &s;anctified are become &s;aints, they bring forth the fruits of holine&s;s and &s;anctification, and they are come into fellow&s;hip with God and one other. <HI>Every branch in me,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>that beareth not fruit, he taketh away; but every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.</HI> That branch which beareth not fruit, is ca&s;t into the fire and burned.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome that bring forth fruit, but it is fruit to the fle&s;h, and the wicked one, but I hope you are not of that number: The&s;e &s;eparate them&s;elves from the life of the true vine; the&s;e have no fellow&s;hip nor true member&s;hip with the church of Chri&s;t, while they walk as captives to the devil, and &s;in; the&s;e are of the world, and not of the church. If you would have fellow&s;hip with the church, do not think to have it by outward conformity: Do not think that this will maintain your fellow&s;hip with Chri&s;t, without a life of inward holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s; for that day you break with the truth in your&s;elves, you break off your fellow&s;hip with the church of God, and break your peace with God, and can no way be re&s;tored again to the favour of God, but by an unfeigned repentance; <HI>for the my&s;tery of faith</HI> is to be kept in a pure <HI>con&s;cience:</HI> How is my con|&s;cience defiled, if I wrong not this, or the other man or woman? Some can hold the my&s;tery of faith; &s;o far as it con&s;i&s;ts in a profe&s;&s;ion, they can profe&s;s it, and they preach it; but they have not held the my&s;tery of faith in Chri&s;t, &s;o as to receive life, and virtue, and comfort from him. You have got the hi&s;tory of words and doctrines; but as &s;oon as you defile your con&s;cience, by doing evil things, and depart from the principle of grace, you make &s;hipwreck of faith.</P>
<P>But, my friends, as you have a mind to continue and abide in the faith, and in this travel and heavenly journey,
<PB N="174" REF="020309_0174_0FAEF96A09DF9298">
I would give you this as a certainty, it may do you good when my head lies low: The way to continue in the church of God, and communion of &s;aints, and to retain your peace with God, is to keep a familiar conver&s;e with the truth in your own &s;ouls, and it will keep you from falling, and lead and guide you in your way, in your travel and journey to Heaven. As the mother, when the child cries after her, but cannot go, takes it by the hand and leads it, &s;o if you keep clo&s;e to the truth, it can lead you through all difficulties, through great bu&s;ine&s;s as well as little, and deliver you from &s;nares and temptations, and when you are a&s;&s;aulted, it can bring you off clear. As for communion with God, and communion with the &s;aints and people of God, it &s;tands in that peace, and purity, and keeping a holy frame of mind in your heavenly travel, in the undefiled way, that will at la&s;t bring you to the unde|filed everla&s;ting <HI>re&s;t that remains to the people of God.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SERMON XVI. <HI>The</HI> DAWNING <HI>of the</HI> DAY <HI>of</HI> GRACE <HI>and</HI> SALVATION.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Preached at GRACE-CHURCH-STREET, <DATE>Augu&s;t 2, 1691.</DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU cannot but know and be &s;en&s;ible, that a go&s;|pel-day, a day of grace and &s;alvation, hath dawned upon you, and that the light of it hath broken through many clouds of darkne&s;s, which &s;ometimes you could not &s;ee through. This is an ine&s;timable and un|&s;peakable mercy of God unto us, that the light of the go&s;|pel of &s;alvation &s;hineth upon a people, that without it mu&s;t be mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>There hath been a very dark and cloudy day upon our fore-fathers, and al&s;o upon us, in the days of our igno|rance. We are apt to wander hither and thither, and to
<PB N="175" REF="020309_0175_0FAEF96A47BA5908">
be turned a&s;ide with the wind of mens' doctrine, that we could not find a re&s;t, a home or a &s;ettlement for our &s;ouls, in order to eternal life. And there are many that have cried unto God, that he would plea&s;e to reveal his way, and to make it known unto them; and they have been apt to covenant with the Lord, that if once they come to a certainty, they would walk in it. Unto &s;uch as the&s;e the Lord hath bowed his ear, and hath an&s;wered them; and in his an&s;wering the cry of the &s;oul, he hath brought &s;al|vation near, and hath revealed the power by which he would bring it to pa&s;s, in every particular &s;oul that re|ceiveth the go&s;pel of his Son.</P>
<P>But now friends, you that are &s;en&s;ible of this ble&s;&s;ed and glorious vi&s;itation of his go&s;pel-day, in which <HI>&s;alva|tion is brought near,</HI> it is needful for every one to exa|mine their own hearts, whether they have really received the go&s;pel; whether they have received and embraced the great bounty, and un&s;peakable ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel, with which the Lord God of life hath vi&s;ited us, or whether they have rejected it. For though it is our happine&s;s to know the vi&s;itation of life, yet it doth not follow that every one that is vi&s;ited will be made an heir of it; for <HI>there are many that fall &s;hort through their unbelief.</HI> There are many that have received the go&s;pel, who do di&s;obey the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and &s;o have not eternal life by it.</P>
<P>When people come to this &s;erious examination of them|&s;elves herein, then the light and grace, that comes from Chri&s;t unto every one of us, both to him that rejects it, as well as to him that receiveth it, that will make known to them their &s;tate and condition, with re&s;pect to the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. For there are a great many, that by an alienation of their minds from the light of Chri&s;t Je|&s;us, are apt to be mi&s;taken in their &s;tate, and to make a better judgment of them&s;elves, and of their &s;tate inwardly, than really it will amount to in the day that the Lord &s;earcheth and trieth them. But they that make a judgment of them&s;elves, by the openings and di&s;coveries that they have through the light of Chi&s;t Je&s;us (for &s;o we are to do in this weighty matter) they make a judgment of their &s;tate and condition, according to the evidence that the Spirit
<PB N="176" REF="020309_0176_0FAEF96C69BD0348">
of God bears to their &s;pirits; and this I hope you will all &s;ay is a mo&s;t certain way. For if we go to compare our&s;elves one with another, and &s;ay, I am better than thee, and that man is better than I, here we are liable and &s;ubject to a great many errors, where there ought to be none. But if we come to mea&s;ure and determine our pre|&s;ent &s;tate and condition, by the evidence of the Spirit of God, bearing witne&s;s with our &s;pirits, here we have a foun|dation to place an infallible and certain judgment upon. And they that are obedient to the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, are capable of giving a &s;ound judgment of their &s;tate, becau&s;e they are made partakers, through Chri&s;t, of that grace, and light, and truth, which they &s;hould be obedient to; and they are brought into a kind of knowledge and un|der&s;tanding of their duty, whether they do it or no. And this knowledge, and this under&s;tanding that God hath given them, makes them capable to pa&s;s a right judgment upon their own &s;tate. They will not call it a good &s;tate, if it be an evil &s;tate; and they will not call it an evil &s;tate, if it be a good one. They know it is good by the princi|ple of truth in their judgment.</P>
<P>Therefore &s;ince there are &s;o many uncertainties in the world, and that men are &s;o apt to take hold of an uncer|tain way of judging and determining, even in matters relat|ing to their &s;ouls: There is a greater aptne&s;s in people to take hold of uncertainties, in judging about the matters of their &s;ouls, than in tho&s;e things that relates to their bodies. Seeing people are &s;o liable to it, it can do none of us harm to exhort one another, and move and &s;tir up one another, to make a calculation of our &s;tates, by &s;omething that will not deceive. There are abundance deceived in this coun|try, as well as other countries; we &s;hall not need to go in|to foreign parts to find people deceived and deluded. It will not be ami&s;s to &s;ay, the drunkard, the &s;wearer, he liar, the oppre&s;&s;or, the proud, and the malicious, are de|ceived: If they were not &s;o, they would never be over|come by the wicked one; the author of all evil, he hath de|ceived them, in that they &s;hould think to go on in the&s;e things, and cry <HI>peace, peace,</HI> to one another, and in their own &s;ouls: This is a great delu&s;ion; and the devil is the
<PB N="177" REF="020309_0177_0FAEF96D41DC49B0">
great deluder that they are deluded by: And it would be worth the while to find out <HI>that</HI> which would make a man think him&s;elf in a happy &s;tate, and hope to enjoy eternal life, with God and Chri&s;t; and when he goes on in &s;in and iniquity, it would be worth the while to find out the delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>There is nothing &s;o proper to turn every one to the grace of God, as <HI>to &s;earch their own hearts, and try their ways.</HI> This is that which will di&s;cover their thoughts, and make them known to them&s;elves: This is God's grace and gift to men while they are yet &s;inners and di&s;obedient; he doth not withhold his grace, but gives his grace, and light and truth, <HI>even to the rebellious: He gives gifts to men, even to the rebellious,</HI> that he might have a place and dwelling among them, that they might know there is a God <HI>that &s;earches the heart, and tries the reins,</HI> and judges all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. If God hath given thee &s;o much grace, that he might have a dwelling in thy heart, &s;hould not that re&s;train thee from &s;in, that the devil, by his temptations, might not defile thee, and unfit thee for the kingdom of God? When the Lord comes to &s;earch the heart, it is in order to the purging of it, and the taking away of iniquity and &s;in, that would unfit thee for his kingdom. This is a better way, and more excellent than living to the fle&s;h, and fulfilling the lu&s;ts thereof. Let people live ever &s;o much to their own corrupt wills, in pride, wantonne&s;s, loo&s;ne&s;s, and the vanity of their minds, they will not find &s;o much true &s;atisfaction and delight, as in living a holy life, living in the fear of God, and avoiding &s;in, and keeping them&s;elves from the temptations and &s;nares of the devil.</P>
<P>This is a more excellent way; and it is our work and bu&s;ine&s;s to declare to people this more excellent way, which all, one time or other, will confe&s;s. This is irk&s;ome, &s;ome will &s;ay; this will abate my plea&s;ure and delights in the world, and &s;poil my &s;ecular intere&s;t. If it were not for this rea&s;on, they would grant it were better to live a holy life, and to live in the fear of God, than live in the &s;er|vice of the devil; and their carnal intere&s;t lies in the way, and weighs down the &s;cale, but it is becau&s;e thou joine&s;t with it, otherwi&s;e the devil, and all the powers of hell,
<PB N="178" REF="020309_0178_0FAEF96D534D6800">
could not weigh it down. If people would con&s;ider the&s;e things &s;eriou&s;ly, they would &s;ay, it is better to &s;erve God, that made them, and gave them life, and breath, and be|ing, than him that would de&s;troy them; and then when they meet with the plea&s;ures and delights of the world, that the devil lays before them, they would never weigh down the &s;cale again&s;t a Divine Rea&s;on: If thou wilt give thy heart to it, and &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider it, it will weigh down the &s;cale again&s;t all temptations to live in &s;in, and plea&s;ure, and jollity. If thou wilt but join with this Di|vine Rea&s;on, that tells thee the&s;e carnal plea&s;ures and en|joyments are not nece&s;&s;ary for thy &s;oul, but it is nece&s;|&s;ary to live a holy, heavenly life, and to &s;erve the Lord that gave thee life, and breath, and all things; that hath vouchsafed thee manifold pre&s;ervations. If thou wilt but join with the Divine Rea&s;on, and hearken to that which opens the truth in thine own heart, all the devil can do, cannot make thee &s;erve him; for the devil hath no coer|cion, no power to force thee to commit &s;in; he cannot make a man work wickedne&s;s again&s;t his will; he mu&s;t cloud the under&s;tanding, and work upon the will, and al|lure and entice the affections by earthly things. So thou can&s;t not be forced by the devil again&s;t thy will, to yield to his temptations, to commit any &s;in; but thou mu&s;t &s;ay, I will do it.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, when the under&s;tanding is bribed, and the will allured and &s;educed by the devil's temptations, there is no with&s;tanding them. But on the other hand, if men would give up them&s;elves to the power of God, they would have Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and joining with that power, they would <HI>be more than conquerors.</HI> Therefore we cannot but be en|couraged to keep in the way of the Lord, and have ac|quaintance with the power of God, which will pre&s;erve you, and give you victory over all the temptations and a&s;&s;aults of the devil; and without this power you cannot overcome; but if you have the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this power, nothing will be too hard for you. When you are in &s;traits, and in a helple&s;s condition, you &s;ometimes are ready to cry out, I &s;hall not overcome my &s;piritual enemies; I &s;hall never get victory over &s;in and the world,
<PB N="179" REF="020309_0179_0FAEF96E17F64ED0">
the fle&s;h and the devil; and I &s;hall never be able to with|&s;tand his temptations, but they will prevail over me all my days. No wonder you make this conclu&s;ion, when you have parted with your tru&s;t and dependence on that power that is able to overcome the devil, and baffle him in your thoughts, words and deeds.</P>
<P>You may be ready to &s;ay, alas! of my&s;elf I can do no|thing; I am not able of my&s;elf <HI>&s;o much as to think a good thought;</HI> yet by Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, I do many times think good thoughts. <HI>In me, that is, in my fle&s;h, there dwells nothing that is good.</HI> Not in my fle&s;h ab&s;tractly; &s;eparate from the power of God, and the Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance vouch|&s;afed unto me. <HI>In my fle&s;h dwells nothing that is good.</HI> But if you take me as one that hath faith in Chri&s;t the Mediator, this faith embraceth the tender of the love of God in the Redeemer. And when I have this faith, there dwells a good thing in me; and from this good thing that dwells in me, there flows forth good words and good ac|tions; then you come to be acquainted with a power greater than your own; and if you tru&s;t in it, you will be able to with&s;tand temptations. When you are tempted to any &s;in, you will not only be able to with&s;tand the tempta|tion, but to overcome it too, and to be more than con|querors in your &s;piritual warfare. This relying upon, and tru&s;ting in the power of God, is that which we call faith; and this faith is the operation of God.</P>
<P>To &s;peak in plain words, God will operate upon thy mind, and make thee know, that this is his power, light, truth and grace, by which he would &s;ave thee. And af|ter God hath wrought and opened unto thee in this man|ner, it is thy duty then to belive in it, to put thy tru&s;t and confidence in it, to be delivered. But though faith be offered unto me, yet it is not forced upon me; God hath offered faith to all men, but he doth not force it upon any. All have an opportunity offered to them; if they will but join with it, they may have &s;aith wrought in them, and be fitted and prepared for the kingdom of God.</P>
<P>There are many that are convinced of the truth of the doctrine that we preach to them, but they do not get into
<PB N="180" REF="020309_0180_0FAEF96ED4910B90">
the power of the truth; they will hear us preach of the power of truth, and will hear what this man &s;aith, and what the other man &s;aith; and this will &s;erve their turn, that they may talk of religion, and make a profe&s;&s;ion: But they do not &s;eek after that power that &s;hould enable them <HI>to work out their own &s;alvation.</HI> The&s;e per&s;ons grow in knowledge, but they do not grow in grace; they will embrace truth as far as doctrine and words will go; they have profe&s;&s;ed it, and they have &s;uffered reproach for it, and yet they have not received the truth in the love of it; they cannot reach to the power of it; they glory in their knowledge and in their under&s;tanding, but they come not to that which &s;anctifies them; they are not able to re&s;i&s;t the devil, and to &s;tand again&s;t his temptations; when a temptation comes, they join with it, but they cannot with|&s;tand it: They come to the knowledge of truth in words, but they come not to the knowledge of the power of it in their hearts and minds, &s;o as to make them prepared ve&s;|&s;els for God's honour; God is more di&s;honoured by them than by tho&s;e that never profe&s;&s;ed his name: They fall into the temptation of the devil, and never di&s;cern the ope|ration of God's power in their own hearts.</P>
<P>Secondly, There is another error as great as this; there are a great many that when the Lord's power hath wrought in their hearts, and they have truth opened to them in the power of it, yet they have not believed in it, they have not had faith wrought in their hearts, they have not tru&s;|ted in it, nor relied upon the power; &s;o they are weak and feeble, they have little faith, which is next to none at all. If they have ever &s;o much knowledge, how ea&s;y can the devil tempt them to &s;in, if they have no faith; <HI>this is the victory,</HI> &s;aith the apo&s;tle, <HI>that overcomes the world, even your faith.</HI> This is not my victory, that I &s;ee the &s;ubtilty and wiles of Satan, and know much; but that which is my victory is my faith: My tru&s;t is in the power of God, and my reliance upon him who is God, migh|tier than all the &s;trength of men and devils; that God who knows my heart. If I be faithful to him, and rely upon him by faith, I &s;hall re&s;i&s;t the devil, and with&s;tanding his temptations, obtain victory over them.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="020309_0181_0FAEF96FA4D75DB0">This power you may have by the go&s;pel; but then you mu&s;t be true to the power of it in your&s;elves; for I do di&s;|tingui&s;h between the go&s;pel, as it is a doctrine and word preached, and an invi&s;ible, divine power working upon men by the preaching of the go&s;pel; you will all hear the go&s;pel preached, though you be ever &s;o proud and high-mind|ed, and you will &s;ay it is true; but you can never come to the &s;aving knowledge of the go&s;pel it&s;elf, till you find it work|ing inwardly upon your&s;elves.</P>
<P>We do not pretend to any power of opening mens hearts, as God opened the heart of Lydia; but when people come to wait upon God with a &s;erious and religious mind, you will find the power of the word working effectually upon you, and &s;o the go&s;pel <HI>will become the power of God</HI> to your <HI>&s;alvation.</HI> This is, and &s;hall be my prayer, for all religious a&s;&s;emblies, that the Lord will be plea&s;ed to teach them, by his invi&s;ible word, and beget living de&s;ires in them towards him&s;elf, and bring them to an e&s;teem of holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, that they may adorn the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, by living go&s;pel-lives; for want of this, what di&s;honour have men brought to God, and what reproach upon the go&s;pel. O! that people would come to hear the word preached, with de&s;ire to profit by it, and &s;ay, Lord, do me &s;ome good this day, give me a powerful refre&s;hing vi&s;itation at this time; give me &s;ome living experience of thy Almighty Power working upon my heart, that I may nor be led by this man's word, or that man's opinion; for if they mi&s;take, I &s;hall be mi&s;taken: But if I build my faith upon what God in his word reveals to me, I &s;hall infallibly know what I am to believe and practi&s;e, and I &s;hall receive from God &s;ome good thing, and I &s;hall <HI>know what is the good and acceptable will of God;</HI> I &s;hall find that there is power in the go&s;pel <HI>for building me up in the mo&s;t holy faith,</HI> and that <HI>it is mighty, through God, for the pulling down of the &s;trong holds of &s;in and Satan,</HI> and I &s;hall <HI>&s;ee the &s;alvation of God brought near to me.</HI></P>
<P>When the go&s;pel becomes the power of God, and work|eth upon the hearts of men by the operation of the Divine Power, they may di&s;tingui&s;h between that faith that is built upon the declarations of men, and that which is
<PB N="182" REF="020309_0182_0FAEF970A2CEDF98">
wrought by the revelation and di&s;covery of the mind of God in their &s;ouls; this is that which we may bottom up|on, and have an anchor &s;ure and &s;tedfa&s;t in our own &s;ouls; when I depend upon Chri&s;t, <HI>the rock of ages,</HI> both of this age, and all other ages, my faith mu&s;t be placed upon him; and when I hear the word of a man, I mu&s;t have an eye to God, that he will reveal his power in my heart; this will make me believe in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and <HI>re|ceive that ingrafted word which is able to &s;ave my &s;oul:</HI> I &s;hall not only hear the word, but live in obedience to it. What &s;ignifies it to make a profe&s;&s;ion that I have the light within, if I do not give obedience to it? For without that, it is all hypocri&s;y; all pretence to holine&s;s, or righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, all mortification, is but hypocri&s;y, any further than we find the power of truth making an impre&s;&s;ion upon our hearts and minds, bringing us to the obedience of faith.</P>
<P>Let them therefore that profe&s;s righteou&s;ne&s;s, live righ|teou&s;ly, and they that hear the go&s;pel, live in obedience to it; and tho&s;e that profe&s;s to be Chri&s;tians, let them live like Chri&s;tians indeed: When every one comes to know within him&s;elf, &s;o far as the go&s;pel hath &s;hined upon him, that they have received the truth in the love of it, and love the truth as it is in Je&s;us, and are obedient to the go&s;pel, they &s;hall know the &s;alvation of it. There is a di&s;covery of God's power in the go&s;pel, and there is a believing of it, and tru&s;ting in it; this is that which belongs to a Chri&s;|tian, this is the beginning and the fir&s;t &s;tep to a Chri&s;tian life; we mu&s;t believe in Chri&s;t; <HI>for without faith it is im|po&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God.</HI> He that believeth, &s;hould be careful to walk in the truth that he hath received, and then he &s;hall have a te&s;timony of the power and virtue of it in his own &s;oul. This virtue and power, if he joins with it, hath the government of his heart and life, and gives him victory over the world, and the temptations of Satan.</P>
<P>You know in the primitive times there were believers that not only held the faith, but <HI>loved by faith;</HI> and by that faith they got victory over all the allurements, and plea|&s;ures and vanities of the world. <HI>I have fought a good fight,</HI> &s;aith the apo&s;tle, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iv, 7, 8, <HI>I have fini&s;hed my cour&s;e, I have kept the faith, henceforth is laid up for me a crown

of righteou&s;ne&s;s, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, &s;hall give me at that day, and not to me only, but unto all them al&s;o that love its appearing.</HI> I have got the victory and there remains an eternal weight of glory for me.</P>
<P>My friends, this is our ambition, and all our labour among you, that you may be built up in the mo&s;t holy faith; that you may be brought home to Chri&s;t, in all your meetings and gatherings together: You &s;hould de|&s;ire to be enriched with faith, and to have your own &s;tore-hou&s;e filled with all the fruits of the Spirit, and not only &s;eek for the knowledge of the truth, but be &s;ubject and obedient to what you know, otherwi&s;e by your religion you will but hurt your&s;elves. And the apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> 2 <HI>Peter,</HI> i, 12, &s;peaks of knowing the truth, and of being e&s;tabli&s;hed in it, and of &s;ome that <HI>after they had e&s;caped the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, and the latter end with them is wor&s;e than the beginning; for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteou&s;ne&s;s, than after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.</HI> There is a power goes along with the preaching of the go&s;pel, that will enable you to do what you know; the go&s;pel is a powerful doctrine, whether you know it or not, or whether you &s;ubmit to it or not, yet pray remember that God's <HI>people are a willing people in the day of his power,</HI> they are a certain &s;ort of people that are devoted to God, and &s;ubmit all their worldly honours, intere&s;ts, profits and plea&s;ures, to the plea&s;ure of God, and de&s;ire no other plea|&s;ure or happine&s;s, but to enjoy his pre&s;ence and favour; they are &s;ati&s;fied with this, and they are a happy people, being made <HI>a willing people in the day of God's power;</HI> they are willing to deny them&s;elves, to take up a daily cro&s;s and follow <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and have <HI>&s;alvation</HI> upon his terms.</P>
<P>There are a great many profe&s;&s;ors that have notions, and out-&s;ide appearances, but they want that virtue, and life, and power, that &s;hould &s;ettle them in religion, and a love of the truth.

<P>IT is man's great happine&s;s in this world to have ac|quaintance with God, with the Lord that made him, from whom he hath life and breath here, and his eternal welfare hereafter; this doubtle&s;s every one will acknow|ledge one time or other, that peace with God is a great jewel, and the be&s;t e&s;tate and riches. It is the great de&s;ire of every one that they may attain to this one time or other; and there is a great neglect of happine&s;s among the &s;ons and daughters of men, in not &s;eeking of it, and not labouring
<PB N="186" REF="020309_0186_0FAEF97376F35E18">
to attain it while it is to be had; Oh! how many trifle away their time about &s;liding and peri&s;hing objects, and they know at the &s;ame in&s;tant that they are yet de&s;titute of the favour of God, and peace with him. Oh, friends! the very thoughts and con&s;ideration of the worth of this jewel, and of the mi&s;ery of being without it, and the un|certainty of our time while it is to be attained, might put every one upon a &s;erious, diligent enquiry after the way and means whereby they might attain it, that &s;o they might have a re&s;ting-place for their &s;ouls, and &s;atisfaction to their in|ward man, that it &s;hall go well with them, when time &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P>And they that come to this con&s;ideration, and are re&s;olved in their hearts and minds, that they will labour after this, and &s;et their whole endeavour after it, they will in the fir&s;t place &s;eek <HI>the kingdom of God, and the righteou&s;ne&s;s thereof:</HI> The&s;e do need a daily encouragement in their way to Hea|ven, and there is nothing on the Lord's part wanting to &s;uch &s;ouls, but that they may attain their de&s;ire.</P>
<P>But alas! this hath been, and is &s;till the mi&s;ery of thou|&s;ands, they are &s;eeking after peace with God, but they err in the way to it, they do not &s;eek in that way, nor take hold of tho&s;e methods, by and through which God hath promi&s;ed peace; you &s;hall &s;carce meet with any body, but they would have eternal life and peace with God; we &s;hall not need to per&s;uade people to with for, and to de&s;ire to have peace with God when they &s;hall come to die, and lay down their heads in the du&s;t. There is not a <HI>Balaam,</HI> but he de&s;ires to <HI>die the death of the righteous, and that his la&s;t and way be like his:</HI> There is not a <HI>Scribe,</HI> or a <HI>Phari&s;ee,</HI> or any that profe&s;s religion, but they are &s;eeking eternal life. The Lord Je&s;us did witne&s;s concerning them, that they were an envious, proud, per&s;ecuting people, yet that they did &s;eek after eternal life, and they pitched upon &s;ome methods and ways whereby they thought to get and enjoy it; but all this was error &s;till, they where out of the way of attaining it, and &s;o are a great many people at this very day; they are in a &s;tate and condition wherein they are never like to enjoy it; the methods and the ways that they have cho&s;en to them&s;elves, to find eternal life by, and
<PB N="187" REF="020309_0187_0FAEF9748203BF40">
to obtain peace with God, will never an&s;wer the end.</P>
<P>And God hath been plea&s;ed to di&s;cover to us the many by-ways that people have cho&s;en, and &s;eek peace with God by; therefore we are willing at all times, to &s;hew people their error in the&s;e great matters of highe&s;t concernment to them. If they did err in their way of &s;eeking to obtain &s;ome earthly good, and mi&s;&s;ed their end, they know the price of it, it is but a lo&s;s of &s;o much, which if they had taken a right cour&s;e, they might have attained; but it is an un&s;peakable lo&s;s, an ine&s;timable lo&s;s, if they lo&s;e peace with God, and all the pains and labour they are at to obtain it.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech you, friends, con&s;ider the&s;e things, they are of great weight, and you will &s;ay &s;o one day or other; for, &s;aith our Saviour, <HI>what will it profit a man to gain the whole world, and lo&s;e his own &s;oul? Or what &s;hall a man give in exchange for his &s;oul?</HI> O! How &s;ad is it to con&s;ider, that a man hath not made provi&s;ion for his &s;oul, that he hath not a place of re&s;t for his immortal &s;oul, and that the arms of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t are not open to receive his &s;oul, when his body can retain it no longer! If this be a man's &s;tate when he comes to die, it had been better for him that he had never been born: Men may live and gather riches, and enjoy a plentiful e&s;tate; but if they be de&s;titute of the favour of God, and peace with him, what will they do with the&s;e peri&s;hing enjoyments? They cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;a|tisfy them&s;elves with the&s;e tran&s;itory, vi&s;ible things; but if the&s;e per&s;ons only mind their bodies, and neglect their &s;ouls, do they not <HI>live like the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h?</HI> The bea&s;t &s;eeks after his meat, and when he finds it, he eats it with delight and plea&s;ure, and in a little while he lies down and dies, and there is an end; &s;o it is with carele&s;s &s;ouls, that have no regard to their future &s;tate; but they &s;ay, <HI>let us eat, and drink, and be merry, for to-morrow we &s;hall die.</HI></P>
<P>Oh! that every one of us did apply our hearts &s;eri|ou&s;ly to the con&s;ideration of the weight of the&s;e things that concern our eternal &s;tate; if per&s;ons did this, then they might come to an enquiry into their own &s;ouls, what method and way is mo&s;t &s;afe for the attaining of &s;o ble&s;|&s;ed an end. For you know there are abundance of people, if you look up and down in the world, you will &s;ee
<PB N="188" REF="020309_0188_0FAEF974C8573548">
every body almo&s;t hunting up and down in &s;ome way of religion or other, and are engaged in religious performances: What is the matter? what would you have? We would have peace with God here, and everla&s;ting re&s;t hereafter in the kingdom of Heaven; that we would have. Thus have the nations been &s;cattered and driven up and down in the pur&s;uit of happine&s;s and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>There is a general belief among&s;t people, that there is a Heaven, and a Hell, and that they mu&s;t have their part in one of them; there are none that de&s;ire a portion in the <HI>lake that burns with fire and brim&s;tone.</HI> Tho&s;e prophane wretches that cry to God to damn them, they do not mean what they &s;peak, they would be &s;aved for all that; every one will cry at la&s;t, Lord have mercy upon me, if he hath but time to &s;ay &s;o: Let us cry, Lord have mercy upon me now; Lord be&s;tow thy &s;avour upon me; <HI>Lord lift up the light of thy countenance upon me;</HI> Lord touch my hard heart, and &s;often it and break it, by the power of thy Spirit; <HI>open mine eyes, that I may &s;ee the wonderful things of thy law;</HI> open mine ears, that I may hear thy voice. It is good for people to make u&s;e of time while they have it; who&s;oever calls upon the name of the Lord &s;hall be &s;aved, and God will <HI>pour out his wrath upon tho&s;e that call not upon his name.</HI> He that calls upon the name of the Lord, &s;hall be &s;aved; and God gives great encouragement to people to &s;eek after him.</P>
<P>What mean you by &s;eeking after God? I have gone to church, and &s;aid my prayers; I have gone in the way which my fathers have led me, and directed me, I hope I &s;hall find mercy at la&s;t; I am a believer, I believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t that died for my &s;ins, and ro&s;e again for my ju&s;tification; I hope, through the merits of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, I &s;hall be &s;aved. What mean you by &s;eeking after the Lord? Do not we all hear of him, and pray to him every day?</P>
<P>Is there any thing more common than this, that peo|ple &s;peak to one another generally about? as for the ge|neral knowledge of God, you and I may &s;ee to our &s;or|row, that a great many <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Lord, Lord, that are never like to enter into the kingdom of God.

kingdom of Heaven, it would be a very foul kingdom: If all the drunkards and whoremongers of <HI>England,</HI> and all prophane ungodly per&s;ons, that will take the name of God in their mouths, &s;hould enter into the kingdom of Heaven, it would be a very unclean and impure king|dom; there is <HI>nothing enters</HI> there <HI>that is unclean, that is abominable, that loveth to make a lie.</HI> So that there mu&s;t be &s;ome more peculiar people that &s;hall have an abun|dant entrance into the kingdom of God; and there mu&s;t be &s;omething that will entitle them to it. For you may remember our Saviour &s;aith, <HI>no man knoweth the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son &s;hall reveal him.</HI> So much as may be known of God by works, you and I may know, without the revelation of Chri&s;t; we need not wait for this knowledge, we can have it by books; we can have it by Chri&s;t's revelation. Nothing would &s;erve &s;ome in our Saviour's time, but eternal life; and our Lord Je&s;us bids them <HI>&s;earch the &s;criptures, for in them</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>you think to have eternal life, and they are they which te&s;|tify of me.</HI> Yet for all the profe&s;&s;ion they made, he tells them, <HI>no man hath &s;een God at any time, neither &s;een his &s;hape, nor heard his voice;</HI> they were &s;trangers to God, though they had a general knowledge of God.</P>
<P>So it is at this day; there is a general knowledge of God, and people hope to obtain peace with God, and eter|nal life. Their parents and their tutors have in&s;tructed them in the principles of Chri&s;tianity, and about the at|tributes of God; but all this will not bring a man to a &s;aving knowledge of God, and reconciliation with him: For a man that is as wicked as the devil can make him, knows the&s;e things, and yet may be a &s;ervant of the de|vil, and do his work; he is not born again, and become a child, In all his external knowledge. Now he that de|&s;ires to come to the true, &s;aving knowledge of God, our Saviour hath told us, <HI>that none knows the Father but the Son, and him to whom the Son will reveal him;</HI> this is a &s;ure way to come to the true knowledge of God, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; he hath the key that openeth the heart, and he will bring us to the true knowledge of God the Fa|ther. <HI>Chri&s;t hath</HI> the key of David, <HI>which openeth, and
<PB N="190" REF="020309_0190_0FAEF9776DD6D918">
no man &s;hutteth; and &s;hutteth, and no man openeth.</HI> He can bring us to behold the glory of God in his own face; without him we are never like to come to the &s;aving know|ledge of God.</P>
<P>Poor man is in a lap&s;ed, fallen &s;tate, he is fallen into &s;in, and is in a &s;tate of alienation from God, and therefore he cannot come to him but by a Mediator; <HI>there is one Medi|ator between God and man, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> and he mu&s;t make peace for him, el&s;e he will never have it: How then &s;hall we come to Chri&s;t, if he is the only means, and there is no other by which we may come to the knowledge of God, as the &s;cripture &s;peaks? Hearken to it, how may we come to Chri&s;t? I an&s;wer, you will never come to him; if he fir&s;t come not to you, you will never be able to do it. It is not coming to Chri&s;t, when you &s;ay, you do believe that Chri&s;t died and ro&s;e again, and a&s;cended up into Heaven, and &s;its at the right hand of God, and lives forever to make interce&s;&s;ion for his people, and to read tho&s;e words and doctrines which he preached up and down at meetings, and &s;olemn a&s;&s;emblies; but if you believe that he is <HI>the eternal Son of God, and the author of eternal &s;alvation to all that obey him,</HI> you mu&s;t come to him, and entirely give up your|&s;elves to his glory and &s;ervice; without this, you cannot come to him, nor will he bring you to the Father: Chri&s;t is come near to us, he &s;tands at the door of our hearts, and he &s;tands and knocks: <HI>Behold!</HI> that is a word that calls for attention, for people to take notice of. <HI>Behold, I &s;tand at the door and knock;</HI> what do&s;t thou knock for? &s;aith Chri&s;t, that thou maye&s;t open the door of thy heart; <HI>for if any man open, I will come and &s;up with him, and he with me, and my Father will come to him, and we will make our abode with him.</HI></P>
<P>Now people are loth to be at this pains and trouble, to open the door of their hearts to Chri&s;t, for they will not believe it is Chri&s;t that knocks, and that rebukes and checks them, when they refu&s;ed to open to him; when they find &s;omething within that reproves them for their &s;in, and doth condemn them that they cannot be at quiet, they will never believe that this is Chri&s;t: How can this be Chri&s;t? they &s;ay, He is a&s;cended up to Heaven, and he is at the right hand of
<PB N="191" REF="020309_0191_0FAEF977C87FF2F8">
God the Father: Will you make me believe that this is Chri&s;t knocking at the door of my heart? I cannot believe it: But what &s;aith our Saviour, <HI>unle&s;s you believe that I am he, you &s;hall die in your &s;ins:</HI> For there is nobody el&s;e can help you out of them</P>
<P>There is a two-fold con&s;ideration that we are to have of Chri&s;t; one is, as he was <HI>made of a woman, made under the law;</HI> and another con&s;ideration of Chri&s;t is, as he is the eternal Son of God. Men have very gro&s;s thoughts of Chri&s;t, to think, that becau&s;e he is in Heaven, therefore he cannot be here too: They mea&s;ure him by them&s;elves; they know becau&s;e a man is at London, therefore he cannot be at York at the &s;ame time. Thus the&s;e men object, if Chri&s;t is in Heaven, how can he be here? His doctrine and precepts are here, let us make u&s;e of them all; he will come again at the day of judgment; but this is a day of judg|ment: Doth not he judge you now? <HI>He is the judge both of quick and dead, and he is the &s;earcher of hearts, and the trier of the reins;</HI> &s;o that thou can&s;t not think an ill thought, but he will tell thee of it; he is nearer to thee than the wife of thy bo&s;om, or thy hu&s;band that is near to thee: Hu&s;band and wife may think an ill thought, but they cannot tell one another of it; but Chri&s;t is one that comes &s;o near thee, that thou can&s;t not conceive an ill thought again&s;t thy neigh|bour, but he will tell thee of it.</P>
<P>This is the Lord Chri&s;t, as a Spirit, a quickening Spirit, who is made manife&s;t in the fle&s;h: <HI>He hath given to every man a mea&s;ure of the Spirit to profit withal: The grace of God which bringeth &s;alvation, hath appeared unto all men.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding the di&s;tinction of learned men between common grace and &s;piritual grace, this grace <HI>that brings &s;al|vation, hath appeared unto all men.</HI> This manife&s;tation of the Spirit and light within, we have from Chri&s;t. The&s;e are the ways and methods that the Lord Chri&s;t hath taken to approach near to us. Now your own rea&s;on will tell you, if this be the way and means that Chri&s;t takes to approach near to us, we cannot take another way to approach to him: If Chri&s;t hath taken, I &s;ay, this way to approach to us, by the light and manife&s;tation of his own Spirit, which con|vinceth us of &s;in: If this be Chri&s;t's way of coming to us,
<PB N="192" REF="020309_0192_0FAEF97899996BC8">
there can be no other way of our coming to him, but by the &s;ame method of his grace. He &s;aith, <HI>if you have the light, believe in the light.</HI> I have the light, I am enlighten|ed, there is &s;omething that di&s;covereth my evil thoughts: Why mu&s;t I believe in the light? That you may be children of the light, as our Saviour &s;peaks; they that are the chil|dren of the light &s;hall have it for their inheritance; and they that are children of darkne&s;s, mu&s;t have darkne&s;s for their inheritance: While we have the light, we mu&s;t believe in it, and we &s;hall be made children of the light: God hath &s;ent his Son, and the Son hath &s;ent his Spirit and his heavenly grace into our hearts, that we may draw near to him, and be directed how to attain acquaintance with him, and to do that which plea&s;eth God, and come to be in union with him, and do the works of God. This is that which God requires of us, <HI>that we will believe on him whom he hath &s;ent;</HI> that we may embrace the light, and believe in the light, in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Pray what do you mean by believing? There is &s;omething within me checks and reproves me for &s;in, and calls me off from it, and bids me turn over a new leaf: Mu&s;t I hearken to this? Is this that which you mean by believing? As to this degree of believing, they that reject it now, &s;hall believe it heareafter; for all the world at la&s;t, and the damned in hell &s;hall certainly confe&s;s that there was grace, and light, and means afforded to them, and they might have gone farther, and e&s;caped that mi&s;ery that they are fallen into.</P>
<P>But there is a more precious faith that I would have you partake of, a <HI>faith that worketh by love.</HI> Since the Lord hath been &s;o gracious as to extend his mercy and love to me, I am &s;o taken with the love of God, that I will be obedient to him; this faith that worketh by love, is the &s;aith of God's elect; that by which we may obtain victory over our pa&s;|&s;ions and lu&s;ts, and over &s;atan and the &s;nares of the world; when we are come to clo&s;e with the grace of God, and to believe in Chri&s;t, this is well: But we mu&s;t al&s;o yield obedience and &s;ubjection. Yet when faith hath brought forth obedience, you cannot be ju&s;tified by it, you cannot be &s;aved by your obedience, but Chri&s;t alone: <HI>He is the
<PB N="193" REF="020309_0193_0FAEF9799C8E9F88">
author and fini&s;her of our faith,</HI> and a Mediator from fir&s;t to la&s;t.</P>
<P>Now all that come to clo&s;e with the appearance of Chri&s;t in their own heart, they have laid hold of the method ap|pointed for their coming to him. It is Chri&s;t they mu&s;t hear; he is come &s;o near to men that they may hear his voice, and hear him tell us our very thoughts. Why &s;hould not I hear him when he checks me and reproves me for &s;in? He comes near and tells me that I have done ami&s;s; Lord, I have done iniquity, I will do &s;o no more. Thus Chri&s;t conver&s;eth with his people, and doth not only check and reprove them, when they do that which is evil, but per|&s;uades them and enables them to do good. He is a Medi|ator, he is a middle per&s;on, and hath taken fle&s;h upon him, that he might reconcile them to God, that do believe in him.</P>
<P>Now, when we come to have acquaintance with God, and have cho&s;en him to be our God, he teaches us to do what is good, and reproves us for what evil we have done. Who can choo&s;e a better guide, to lead him into acquaintance with God, than Chri&s;t that is conver&s;ant with us, piercing into our thoughts, and &s;peaking to us? I may hear him with the inward ear of my heart; when I do evil he checks me for it, and tells me the thing I &s;hould &s;eek is of ine&s;timable value; and if through my unbelief and carele&s;ne&s;s I mi&s;s of it, it had been better for me that I had never been born; now we are in the way of coming to receive the end of our faith, the &s;alvation of our &s;ouls, <HI>let us not neglect &s;o great &s;alvation.</HI> No man can &s;ave him&s;elf, nor &s;ave the &s;oul of his brother, nor find a ran&s;om, nor procure an offering for the expiating of his &s;in; therefore let every one that would have his &s;in expiated and pardoned, and cannot be &s;atisfied and quieted, till he hath peace with God; let him come to Chri&s;t, the Mediator, and come with faith and truth in the inward parts, and &s;ubmit to him, and be willing to be ruled by him, then Chri&s;t will &s;ave him, <HI>and pre&s;ent him without &s;pot and blemi&s;h</HI> to his father.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider that tho&s;e that are the people of God, are led by the Spirit of God. They mi&s;s their way to reconciliation with God, that love any other way, or think to come to God any other way than by Je&s;us, the Mediator, their la|bour
<PB N="194" REF="020309_0194_0FAEF97A16227548">
will be lo&s;t: Therefore I mu&s;t exhort and per&s;uade you that are out of the way, that you would take God's me|thod, and come into God's way. The terms, I have told you, are made already; the bargain is not to make now; I will give &s;o much to be at peace with God, or I will part with this or the other thing that is dear to me. No, the agreement is made between God and Chri&s;t, and his <HI>covenant is ordered in all things, and &s;ure;</HI> and his covenant &s;tands &s;ure with none, but tho&s;e that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. There was a covenant made with <HI>Abraham; in thy &s;eed &s;hall all the nations of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> The promi&s;e is made to the &s;eed, that is, to tho&s;e that are in Chri&s;t; the faithful are counted the &s;eed; now the faithful are tho&s;e that are obedient to Chri&s;t, who is the &s;eed of the promi&s;e, <HI>in whom all the families of the earth are ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> They mu&s;t come to Chri&s;t the &s;eed, they mu&s;t not rebel again&s;t him; they mu&s;t come to him, and believe in him; be there never &s;o many nations and families in the world, the promi&s;e is not to them, <HI>but to as many as the Lord our God &s;hall call.</HI></P>
<P>Here is the way for people to lay hold of, for their coming into acquaintance with God, which is of &s;o great nece&s;&s;ity before they die; they mu&s;t come to Chri&s;t him|&s;elf by his Spirit in their own hearts. We need not go to this and the other learned man, and enquire of this and the other &s;ort of people; but we mu&s;t cry to God for help and direction, and come unto him, and give up all the powers and faculties of our &s;ouls to him, to be governed by him: God will have &s;ervants that will be obedient to him; if ever we come to obtain &s;alvation, we mu&s;t have another ma&s;ter, <HI>one is your ma&s;ter, even Chri&s;t;</HI> I mu&s;t come under the government of Chri&s;t, and he mu&s;t lead me, and rule me, if I will be a child of God.</P>
<P>When people come to &s;ee there is no effectual way, but &s;ubmitting to the grace of God in their own hearts, and yielding them&s;elves up to the dictates of the Spirit of Chri&s;t in their &s;ouls; when they come to this, there are many hazards and difficulties to be encountered with; there is the appearance of the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, and we
<PB N="195" REF="020309_0195_0FAEF97AD1BEA9E0">
mu&s;t take up this cro&s;s if we will follow Chri&s;t, and be obedient in all things unto him. This is that which will kill all my plea&s;ure, lay wa&s;te all my religion, and de|&s;troy my hopes; I mu&s;t be like a man that built a hou&s;e without a good foundation; I mu&s;t pull it all down again, and I mu&s;t come to build up again upon a new foundation.</P>
<P>Here many have turned a&s;ide, the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t hath &s;eemed to them &s;o &s;harp, and hard and intolerable, that they could not bear it; they would not be at the charge of &s;uch a religion; what, mu&s;t I part with all my delights, and my beloved lu&s;ts and plea&s;ures, and all my inter|e&s;ts in the world for Chri&s;t? I cannot part with the&s;e, the&s;e things lie in my way, I mu&s;t rather lo&s;e my &s;oul than part with what is &s;o grateful to me, and join with the light of mine own con&s;cience, and the truth in my inward parts; what, mu&s;t not I have &s;o much as liberty of thought? What, mu&s;t my thoughts be regulated by that which is &s;o cro&s;s and repugnant to my mind? Mu&s;t I throw out all evil thoughts out of my heart, and &s;uffer none but good thoughts to remain there? Who can &s;tand here? Who can bear &s;uch &s;trictne&s;s as this? Rather than endure this, I will choo&s;e to lo&s;e my &s;oul; many have lo&s;t the truth on this account, and many are in danger to lo&s;e their &s;ouls.</P>
<P>If there be in you any de&s;ire of peace with God, that you may not go hence before you have attained it, take hold of the pre&s;ent opportunity; hardne&s;s of heart is a de&s;|perate plague, it comes from a long ob&s;tinate continuance in &s;in; when we have <HI>with&s;tood the day of God's patience and long-&s;uffering, and grieved the Holy Spirit of God; then God giveth us up to our own hearts lu&s;ts,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>we will not hearken to the voice of the charmer, charm he never &s;o wi&s;ely;</HI> when we &s;top our ears, and will not attend to the calls of God; when men will go on, and nothing can &s;top them, in the career of their lu&s;ts and plea&s;ures, but they will retain their carnal delight and friend&s;hip with the world; this hard|ne&s;s of heart is a de&s;perate plague; take heed of it, that it doth not overtake you, and bring ruin and de&s;truction upon you: <HI>Con&s;ider the patience and long-&s;uffering of God, and

let his goodne&s;s lead you to repentance: Con&s;ider God hath waited to be gracious to you, he hath exerci&s;ed much long-&s;uffering and patience towards you;</HI> whereas he might have cut you off long ago, and given you your portion with the damned in hell; but he hath hearkened to the Mediator that hath pleaded for you; he hath extended his patience and long-&s;uffering to <HI>the wicked and rebellious al&s;o;</HI> and for this rea&s;on, the apo&s;tle tells us, that Chri&s;t is <HI>the Saviour of all men, e&s;pecially of them that believe.</HI></P>
<P>Now the patience and long-&s;uffering of God hath been lengthened out to all, and we have not improved it. Con|&s;cience hath been &s;en&s;ible of the inward &s;trokes and rebukes of God for &s;in, and of the inward calls of his grace to bring us to repentance; but we have not regarded the&s;e calls, nor hearkened to the voice of God, &s;o as to hear, that our &s;ouls might live; O! let us not put off our repentance any longer; but <HI>to-day, while it is called to-day, let us hear his voice, and harden not our hearts,</HI> but be of a tender heart; let our hearts be &s;oftened, and tendered under the word of God, and under the &s;trokes of his judgment. If ever the Lord bring you under a tender frame, you will receive the word of God with meekne&s;s, and mix it with faith; then it will work effectually to the amendment of your lives; it will work faith in tho&s;e that are unbelievers, and &s;trengthen the faith of tho&s;e that believe. Then we &s;hall have cau&s;e to ble&s;s the Lord, and prai&s;e and magnify his great name for his patience, long-&s;uffering and mercy, which at this day he hath lengthened out, and graciou&s;ly extended to us.</P>

<P>THE in&s;titution of the Chri&s;tian religion was for this purpo&s;e, that holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s might be brought forth in the earth; that God, through his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, might take delight in the &s;ons and daughters
<PB N="197" REF="020309_0197_0FAEF97E8CF064A8">
of men, that they might be reconciled to him; <HI>for that which the law could not do, by rea&s;on of its weakne&s;s, God hath had a purpo&s;e to do by his Son, and to him he gave all power in Heaven and Earth,</HI> that thereby he might be enabled to perform the great work of God, in e&s;tabli&s;hing righteou&s;ne&s;s, and in bringing forth a holy people, to &s;erve a holy God. This is the great ble&s;&s;ing that is come to us, and to all man|kind, through our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Saviour, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that came <HI>to turn every one from the evil of their ways.</HI> That is the way and method by which our Lord Je&s;us accompli&s;h|ed the end of his coming, and the will of his Heavenly Fa|ther; <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and all his wa&s;hings, offerings, and &s;acrifices, could not make clean and purge the con&s;cience; and by all his offerings and &s;acrifices, he could not reconcile us to God: <HI>But Je&s;us, by his once offering him&s;elf did forever perfect them that are &s;anctified; and by one offering, reconciled us to the Father,</HI> and &s;o brings forth a holy generation unto God, through regeneration and the &s;anctification of the Spirit.</P>
<P>And &s;eeing the Lord hath been plea&s;ed in the riches of his grace to open this new and living way, for man's return|ing again into unity and fellow&s;hip with his Maker, the que&s;tion, my friends, that I would put to you on the behalf of God, is, for all of you to con&s;ider, whether it is not be&s;t for every one of us to lay hold of &s;alvation, to lay hold of that ble&s;&s;ing wherewith the Lord hath ble&s;&s;ed us, that &s;o the principal in&s;titution of Chri&s;tianity might not only be named and &s;poken of, but might come to be enjoyed and witne&s;&s;ed in every one of our own &s;ouls; and that all might wait with expectation on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for fulfilling of this great work in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>There is a general notion among people, that Heaven is a holy place, and that nothing that is unclean can enter into it, to have a habitation there, when time in this world &s;hall be no more with us; and that time which we have given us, I am &s;ure is given us of God, as an opportunity of fitting and preparing us for his dwelling-place; and every day and hour of it ought to be employed in that great work, that &s;o we might draw nearer and nearer to that &s;tate and condition that &s;uits and befits that holy dwelling where &s;aints and angels, for evermore, prai&s;e the great and glorious God: So that I
<PB N="198" REF="020309_0198_0FAEF97F829BB980">
am per&s;uaded you believe, that you and all of us, are to be accountable to God for all the time he hath be&s;towed upon us, whether we u&s;e it to the purpo&s;es for which he hath given it, or whether we mi&s;pend our time upon tho&s;e things that are not profitable to us; and upon the&s;e con&s;iderations, we had need all of us to take heed to our pre&s;ent &s;tate that we are come to, and are arrived at in the pre&s;ent time; as for the future time, that we all know we are not &s;ure of; and the future &s;tate that we may hope to come to, there is no certainty of it, unle&s;s there be an improvement of the pre&s;ent time, and the opportunities of our pre&s;ent &s;tate: Therefore every one &s;hould apply their hearts unto the &s;eeking of wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding, and unto God, that he may give us to under&s;tand our &s;tate, and our pre&s;ent fitne&s;s or unfitne&s;s for the kingdom of glory and hap|pine&s;s, and of that holy dwelling we hope to enjoy forever.</P>
<P>If I will but turn my mind inward, to the &s;erious con&s;i|deration of my pre&s;ent &s;tate and condition, I can tell whe|ther I am fit or unfit to approach God's pre&s;ence; and if I find I am unfit, I mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the divine working of that great power, which God hath ordained and appointed for this purpo&s;e; I mu&s;t come to him to work all my works in me, and for me, according to his good plea&s;ure; and that he will never do, unle&s;s it be by cro&s;&s;ing me in my carnal plea&s;ures and corrupt inclina|tions; for that which plea&s;eth man, doth not plea&s;e God: And God will not revoke the holy &s;criptures, that tell us, <HI>that they which live in plea&s;ure, are dead while they live;</HI> they that are indulgent to their own affections, and their own delights, and their own humours, they are not at all ready to plea&s;e and glorify God; they are not fitted for it, therefore he never &s;anctifies, nor brings any into a true Chri&s;tian &s;tate, but through a daily cro&s;s; &s;o that if I am not already fitted and prepared to do that which is plea&s;|ing to God, I may be fitted by taking up a daily cro&s;s, to glorify God here, and enjoy him forever.</P>
<P>What tho&s;e things are that you are to do, I need not tell you, nor what you have done. I judge no man: There is one that judgeth, he will tell you if you ask him, what your &s;tate and condition is; he will tell the

drunkard, if he ask him, whether he is fit for Heaven; and al&s;o the proud and haughty per&s;ons whether they are fit for Heaven: Let &s;uch as are guilty of the&s;e or any other &s;ins, enquire of the oracle in their own bo&s;oms, am not I fit for Heaven, notwith&s;tanding all this? He will tell thee no, there is <HI>no unclean thing &s;hall enter there, nothing that defiles,</HI> nothing that hurts or oppre&s;&s;es; the proud, peevi&s;h, malicious per&s;on, that is hurtful to others, that hurts his neighbour, is &s;hut out. <HI>There &s;hall in no wi&s;e enter into Heaven any thing that defileth,</HI> Rev. xxi, 27. <HI>For without are dogs, and &s;orcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and who&s;oever loveth and mak|eth a lie,</HI> Rev. xxii, 15. None &s;hall enter into the holy city of God, but tho&s;e that are purified and purged from all iniquity: Therefore God hath &s;ent his &s;on Je&s;us, &s;ee|ing none el&s;e could do it: <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the Prophets could not do it, therefore he &s;ent Je&s;us to <HI>ble&s;s us, in turning every one of us from our iniquities,</HI> and from our evil ways; one man hath this evil way, another that evil way: It is all one to him; his work is to turn every one of us from our evil ways.</P>
<P>But why then (you may &s;ay) are &s;o few turned from their evil ways throughout Chri&s;tendom, where Chri&s;t is believed in, profe&s;&s;ed, read and heard; that yet &s;o few are converted and turned? for we &s;ee great numbers of liars, &s;wearers, drunkards, and unclean per&s;ons among us, where Chri&s;t is cried up at a mighty rate, and yet peo|ple are not turned from the evil of their ways; there is &s;omething &s;ure that is the rea&s;on of it.</P>
<P>I would have all of you con&s;ider what the rea&s;on of it is, that tho&s;e that profe&s;s to be Chri&s;tians, are not turned from the evil of their ways; for Chri&s;t <HI>hath all power in Heaven and Earth committed to him,</HI> and he is able to do it, and he was &s;ent from God on purpo&s;e to do it; but this is a certain truth, it is not done; and what is the rea&s;on of it? <HI>He came to his own, and his own received him not;</HI> what is the rea&s;on?

<P>Some &s;ay there is never a man in the world turned from the evil of their ways; they live in &s;in, and they are un|der a fixed nece&s;&s;ity of continuing in it, and lying under it all the days of their lives, for all this belief of the love of God, and the power of Chri&s;t, and the profe&s;&s;ion of it: Some &s;ay there is never a Chri&s;tian in the world can live one day without &s;in, but will defile him&s;elf with one thing or another; that the devil will prevail over men, and &s;in mix it&s;elf with our prayers and alms, and all our holy duties; &s;o that there is nothing clean; nothing pure that We can perform to God. There are others that are not &s;o ra&s;h in their judgment, and not &s;o incon&s;iderate, but they will believe &s;ome men and women may come to a power and ability to with&s;tand &s;atan, and re&s;i&s;t him in his temptations; and that there are tho&s;e that have been turned from the evil of their ways, but they are not; What is the matter? You have &s;pent time about this, what is the rea&s;on you are not turned from the evil of your ways? The devil hath told the people in former days, that the rea&s;on why men live in &s;in, is, becau&s;e God hath appointed it &s;o to be: And that hath &s;topt the mouth of many a plain-hearted tender Chri&s;tian; they have cried un|to God under the weight of their &s;in, and they &s;ee no deliverance after all their prayers and tears, becau&s;e they have been told they cannot do it, and that God hath ap|pointed it &s;hould be &s;o, and required them to do what they cannot do; and with &s;ome the cu&s;tom of &s;in hath taken away the &s;en&s;e of &s;in, and they go on to perdition in their &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>I hope, my friends, that God hath opened your eyes, and that you have better thoughts of God, than that he hath &s;et you a work and a labour to do, and by his eternal power and decree, hath ordained that you &s;hould never do it, but damn you after all. Con&s;ider, there are men and women in

What is the rea&s;on that I am not turned from my evil ways, &s;ince God hath &s;ent his Son Je&s;us to do it, and given him power to do it; why then is it not done?</P>
<P>Some per&s;ons upon enquiry, and after their &s;earch, have brought forth this rea&s;on: They have alleged the great power the devil hath: The devil is &s;o &s;trong, and hath &s;uch a power to darken their minds, and enchant their affec|tions; he injects and brings things into their minds before they are aware of it. I confe&s;s this, and I will &s;ay a little to it, I will confe&s;s as much as the argument will bear, that the devil hath great power, and a way of injecting things into the &s;pirits and affections of people: He is God's enemy and ours too, and he lies in wait, and will do as much as he can again&s;t us, that no one &s;hall get to Heaven; if we come thither, it &s;hall be again&s;t his will: I have heard &s;ome magnify the devil's power to &s;uch a degree, that he hath &s;uch power over a man or woman, that he is able to keep them in &s;in all their life, though God hath put forth the exceeding greatne&s;s of his power for their redemption: This is hard to believe, that the devil is &s;tronger than Chri&s;t Je&s;us: Well, as great as his power is, we are in a capacity of knowing a greater power; the apo&s;tle did comfort the Chri&s;tians, not|with&s;tanding all the power the devil u&s;ed with them to de|file them, and keep them from inheriting the kingdom of God, 1.

now we know we have a keeper: We are a&s;&s;aulted with the devil's temptations, and they are powerful; how powerful? He hath &s;o much power, as he finds in us an inclimation to yield and join with his temptations: If he comes with a temptation to a man or woman that hath no inclination to that thing he tempts them to; if they hate that thing, then there is an end of it: The devil's power lies in this, when he brings a temptation that I have an inclination to, then he hath a party within me; if that be rooted out, what &s;ignifies his power, let him bring ever &s;o many temptations?</P>
<P>There are many of you that under&s;tand what I &s;ay; if a temptation comes to a man to commit an act of uncleanne&s;s, if he be a cha&s;te man, there is no inclination in him to yield to it, or join to it, he hates it, it is an abomination in it&s;elf, and grievous and provoking to God, if he doth it; a man abhors it, then what powerful temptation is it? If it light upon a man of an unclean mind, that is defiled in his heart, he hath not only the devil, but his own lu&s;t and corrupt in|clination to contend with; but if a man believeth in Chri&s;t, he relies upon him, and he will &s;ay, Lord, thou &s;ee&s;t I am under temptation; here is a great and powerful temp|tation, I can never with&s;tand it, but I tru&s;t in thy name and power, do thou ari&s;e and deliver me from it: Thus when God doth ari&s;e, his enemies will be &s;cattered; tho' the devil's power be great, yet there is a deliverer that is &s;tronger than he: The rea&s;on of mens being overcome, doth not lie in the greatene&s;s of the devil's power, but in the frailty of our nature.</P>
<P>Some will &s;ay, that our natures are &s;o frail, weak and depraved, that we can do nothing as as we ought to do; this is given for another rea&s;on, and there is truth in it, but that truth is but a delu&s;ion; they would excu&s;e them&s;elves when they have yielded to a temptation, I am weak and frail, I cannot re&s;i&s;t the devil; though the devil is not &s;tronger than Chri&s;t, yet he is &s;tronger than I, he worketh with all his might, power, and &s;ubtilty to deceive me, and en&s;nare me, and overcome me; I am a poor, frail creature, therefore I mu&s;t yield to him: This is a carnal rea&s;on; as tho' I were to grapple with the devil in mine own &s;trength, and to deliver my &s;oul, as if God hath le&s;t me to my&s;elf: If thou &s;ay,

Lord, thou ha&s;t &s;et me to grapple with the devil, and to with&s;tand his temptations, Lord I am not able to do it my|&s;elf; God will an&s;wer thee, <HI>I have laid help upon one that is mighty, that is able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t, all that come unto me by him;</HI> &s;o that thou art not to overcome the devil by thine own power and ability: If any man reason thus, his rea&s;on is out of doors; for we are &s;aved by Chri&s;t, therefore I cannot plead my own frailty, &s;eeing God hath provided a <HI>rock</HI> for my defence <HI>that is &s;tronger and higher than I,</HI> that I may tru&s;t and rely upon.</P>
<P>So that you &s;ee the frailties of our nature is not a &s;uf|ficient rea&s;on, we mu&s;t &s;eek further for it yet; and when we come to &s;earch narrowly, and to the bottom of our hearts, I will tell you here it re&s;ts; it hath its centre in the perver&s;ene&s;s of the will that is in man, that is con|trary to the will of God; it is the oppo&s;ition of our will to the will of God; we may talk what we will of &s;alva|tion and Chri&s;tianity, that we have a mind to be &s;aved, and go unto God when we die, and to enjoy the happine&s;s of Heaven to eternity: We may talk thus; but as long as the perver&s;ene&s;s of the will continues, I am the cau&s;e of my own ruin; if I grow in a profe&s;&s;ion, this perver&s;e will, will grow up with me under that profe&s;&s;ion, and un|der any profe&s;&s;ion; change your judgment and opinion as often as you li&s;t, this will go along with you; the rea|&s;on and the bottom of things will come to this, none can overcome the devil, nor be a di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t, without a daily cro&s;s. When people come to this, to &s;ee a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of taking up the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, and denying them|&s;elves; when it comes to this, there are &s;uch &s;hifts and eva&s;ions, and arts that men have to cover them&s;elves, to make them&s;elves and others believe, that &s;uch and &s;uch a thing is con&s;i&s;tent with the will of God, and that they may do it, and &s;ave their own &s;ouls; but they boa&s;t of their own deceit, and are glad that they can make a &s;hift to deceive their own &s;ouls; &s;o that there is no hopes of their ever being purged and clean&s;ed, and of having any holy work brought forth by them; but when a man comes to be &s;en&s;ible of his &s;piritual condition, and is &s;in|cere and hone&s;t, he will be ready to &s;ay unto God, if I

Lord; if I in|dulge my&s;elf in any thing that hath a contrariety to thy holy will, Lord, I be&s;eech thee di&s;cover it to me; &s;uch a man will lay a&s;ide his own will, if it be contrary to God's will: Now here is one that is a very fit object for Chri&s;t to work upon; he will not be long before he be &s;avingly convinced. When a man comes to the word, he is convinced of &s;uch an evil in his con&s;cience, where nobody but God and him&s;elf were privy to it, or had any knowledge of it. It is di&s;covered that he liveth in &s;uch a practice as is contrary to the mind of God.

<P>This truth hath a &s;avour in it; and if thou art &s;incere and upright, there is nothing for thee to &s;ay or do, but to &s;et thy&s;elf again&s;t every thing that is contrary to the mind of God, and thou wilt have light from Heaven &s;ent to guide thee and direct thee in thy way thither; if thou wilt but receive that grace that is freely given of God unto thee through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, he will certainly purge thee and clean&s;e thee from thy &s;in, and turn thee from every evil way, notwith&s;tanding the perver&s;ene&s;s of thine own will and the power of &s;atan; and he will work in thy heart by his grace, till it hath brought thee off from thine ini|quity, and wrought iniquity out of thee, and &s;o bring forth a holy work to God.</P>

<P>WE are met upon the mo&s;t weighty affair that can be to every one of us, even to wait that we may have a true knowledge of the beginning, carrying on and perfecting the mighty work of redemption, that people may know that redemption is wrought in their &s;ouls; for every ones &s;oul hath been lo&s;t and captivated, and led away from the pure pre&s;ence of God; all have been alienated by rea&s;on of &s;in, which hath been an uni|ver&s;al wall of partition and hath excluded and &s;hut out un|holy &s;ouls from the Holy God; all that have been defiled and polluted, they have been excluded from his dwelling|place, they have been driven out into the world, and the world hath become a world of mi&s;ery, and of di&s;traction and confu&s;ion to the &s;ons and daughters of men; there hath been <HI>angui&s;h, tribulation and wrath</HI> upon all their &s;ouls, and an in&s;en&s;ibility hath happened unto many, that they have not been apprehen&s;ive of the great depravation they have lain under, and they have not been &s;en&s;ible of the glory of that &s;tate and condition which they were to have enjoyed; and in that &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility they have not &s;ought after the Lord, but have been <HI>captivated and led away by divers lu&s;ts and plea&s;ures,</HI> by which they have wounded their own &s;ouls more and more.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="020309_0209_0FAEF8BAD4F7FB20">And in &s;uch a &s;tate as this it is, that the Lord hath found us; he hath &s;ought us out, and he hath found us <HI>ca&s;t out into the open field, and wallowing, as it were, in our own blood;</HI> and yet this hath been a <HI>time of love;</HI> and he hath manife&s;ted his love to us in this re&s;pect, in that he hath awakened us and brought us to a &s;en&s;e of our depraved and deplorable condition, and given unto a remnant to perceive, that there is a <HI>more excellent glory,</HI> a more ex|cellent enjoyment to be had, than any this world can afford.</P>
<P>But a great many of tho&s;e who&s;e eyes are &s;o far opened, that they can &s;ee and di&s;cern a more excellent glory, yet they cannot receive it, for they are not in a capacity for the enjoyment of it; many have the glimmerings, and &s;ome little light of heavenly things, but they them&s;elves are earthly: Many perceive there is a holy life, but it is not theirs, for their own life is unholy, and yet they know there is a life that is holy and pure. Hereupon de&s;ires are begotten, by the word of life in the &s;ons and daughters of men, through the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Mediator; by him de&s;ires are begotten in people that they might come to enjoy that life of holine&s;s, that they might not only &s;ee a better &s;tate than what they do en|joy, but that they might come to enjoy it, and have it for theirs.</P>
<P>There is a univer&s;al de&s;ire in people that they might have eternal life, and they believe there is an eternal life to be enjoyed; but every one hath it not, and the rea&s;on is, becau&s;e they are not fitted and prepared for the enjoyment of it; for it is a kind of trea&s;ure that is never put into an unclean ve&s;&s;el; there mu&s;t be a clean&s;ing and purifying, that &s;o earthen ve&s;&s;els may come to retain and hold this heavenly trea&s;ure; and when it comes to this, that people mu&s;t be clean&s;ed and puri|fied, here the world turns out to divers means and me|thods; &s;ome have gone to outward wa&s;hings, outward clean&s;ings and ob&s;ervations of this and the other ordi|nance, and when all that hath been done, them&s;elves being judges, they were yet unclean; when they have done all that lies in their power and ability, towards their wa&s;hing and clean&s;ing, and towards preparing them&s;elves,

they have found &s;ome &s;ecret te&s;timony in their own con&s;ciences that their hearts were &s;till unclean, and that there was defilement &s;till abiding and lodging in the &s;ecret of their &s;ouls; and this hath put a great many to a &s;tand, what they &s;hould do; when they have come to the end of all, they know not what to do: Many have cried &s;ecretly, what &s;hall we do to be &s;aved? For all that we can do, cannot &s;ave us. We have retained this, and the other doctrine, followed this and the other way, and made many ob&s;ervations; but all this doth not clean&s;e our &s;oul, nor <HI>purge our con&s;ciences from dead works,</HI> this will not bring us to the inheritance of that immortal life that will give us &s;atisfaction.

<P>Therefore, my friends, that all &s;uch who are brought &s;o far, as to be under &s;uch a burthen and oppre&s;&s;ion, might be informed and come to under&s;tand, where the true re&s;t is, and where that power can be found, that is able to an&s;wer tho&s;e tender de&s;ires that are begotten in them; for this cau&s;e hath the Lord our God communicated and given the di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel of his &s;on, unto a remnant whom he hath &s;anctified, that they might <HI>&s;peak a word in &s;ea&s;on to the weary &s;oul.</HI> This is not a day to <HI>make a mock of &s;in,</HI> this is not a day to make <HI>a covenant with death and hell,</HI> and to re&s;olve to go on in a wicked life, and to continue in it all their days.</P>
<P>But yet there are a &s;ort of people that de&s;ire to have a <HI>word &s;poke in &s;ea&s;on</HI> to them when they are weary. How many are there in our age and generation, that one may reckon of this number, that are &s;inners, and overcome by their lu&s;ts and corruptions, and by the temptation of <HI>&s;atan</HI> and his in&s;truments. But they are weary of it, it is a burthen to their &s;ouls, it co&s;ts them many a bitter tear, many a &s;igh, and many a &s;ad and &s;orrowful thought in &s;ecret, that they &s;hould have a &s;ight of a <HI>more excellent glory,</HI> and of a better life than that of their own, and yet know not how to get into it.</P>
<P>My friends, that &s;ame divine word of life, by which any of the people of the Lord, in any age, were ever re&s;tored,
<PB N="211" REF="020309_0211_0FAEF8BC635BD1A0">
redeemed and purcha&s;ed again to the Lord; that word of life mu&s;t have been at work in their hearts, and hath been at work in them, or el&s;e thou had&s;t never been &s;o far opened; there hath been &s;omething that hath un&s;topped thine ears, that thou mighte&s;t hear; and the rea&s;on of thy continuance in thy bonds, after thy knowing &s;omething that might have freed thee, is, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t not heartily clo&s;ed with that which hath begun the work, which God, by his redeeming power, hath effected in the hearts of them that believe in Chri&s;t, and thereby an inclination is rai&s;ed in people to &s;eek after the Lord.</P>
<P>You know what the apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>it is not of us &s;o much as to think a good thought.</HI> But this all people will grant is a good thought, when a &s;inner thinks of turning to God, and leaving his evil ways, if he had power and ability, and cries out, if I knew how to &s;tand again&s;t temptation, I would never &s;in again&s;t the Lord more; this mu&s;t be a good thought in thy mind: How came it there? Who is the author of this thought, you will &s;ay? This ought to be attributed to the love of God in Chri&s;t, that he hath convinced and per&s;uaded us; and that though there is &s;in and pollution, yet he hath not &s;o for&s;aken us, as utterly to ca&s;t us off, he hath &s;ent forth <HI>his quickening Spirit, that is, the Lord from Heaven,</HI> that he might &s;tir up and quicken people to con&s;ider their condition, and bring them to a &s;en&s;e of their pre&s;ent &s;tate, that they may come into a better &s;tate than they are in at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>If this may be granted, that the Spirit of God, and the grace of God, is the author of the&s;e de&s;ires, then it will be granted at the &s;ame time, that every one of you ought to be &s;en&s;ible, that &s;uch &s;piritual de&s;ires &s;tirring you, are from the motion and operation of the Spirit of God that hath rai&s;ed them in your &s;ouls; and then I hope you will grant, that if you had but joined with that Spirit, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that Spirit, all things would have been po&s;&s;ible thereunto.</P>
<P>So that here is the fir&s;t thing that I would have every one &s;atisfied about in their under&s;tandings, whether they are to|tally exempted from any &s;uch touches and operations of God or no; for it is &s;aid by &s;ome ignorantly, that a great part of mankind have never had any &s;uch divine workings of the Spi|rit
<PB N="212" REF="020309_0212_0FAEF8BD342A2428">
of God upon them, in order to their conver&s;ion; there|fore it is not in vain for you to con&s;ider your &s;tate and con|dition; for if you, or I, or any here, be under &s;uch circum|&s;tances, that they never had, nor are ever like to have any &s;uch divine operations or touches of the &s;pirit of life, in order to conver&s;ion, then I am &s;ure you and I had better never have been born.</P>
<P>If you will con&s;ider with your&s;elves, and lay a&s;ide the di&s;putes of doctors and learned men, you may know the things pertaining to your&s;elves. Things relating to others, I may let di&s;putes alone about them; but as for things relating to my &s;alvation, I mu&s;t have a certain knowledge of them. It concerns you, my friends, to know within your&s;elves, by an infallible evidence of the Spirit of God, whether you have had &s;uch divine touches, workings and operations upon your hearts, as have inclined you to &s;eek the Lord. I hope I may believe there are none here but have in their hearts an an&s;wer; I have had &s;uch touches and operations in me: This is great love from God; more than any tongue can &s;et forth. You will be ready to &s;ay, I have not de&s;erved this; I have not &s;o behaved my&s;elf towards my Maker as to de&s;erve that he &s;hould wait up|on me, and call upon me. <HI>When wilt thou turn, and amend thy life, and hearken to him that made thee? When wilt thou leave &s;erving God's enemy, and &s;erve him that is thy rightful Lord?</HI></P>
<P>So that now this is a great aggravation of our &s;in to continue in it, and yet to have a belief that God is &s;till waiting upon us, and that he hath &s;uch a kindne&s;s for us, as now and then to touch our hearts by the inward ope|ration of his &s;pirit and grace, in order to conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>Now when this is agreed, and men &s;ettle them&s;elves in the belief of this, you know what the con&s;equence will be. When I con&s;ider with my&s;elf, I that have been un|der the&s;e workings, have been rebellious, wicked and di&s;|obedient to God, yet the Lord is not &s;o angry as utterly to ca&s;t me off, but is &s;till waiting to be gracious, by the operation of his &s;pirit, to gather me to him&s;elf, in order to &s;anctify me, and heal my back&s;liding, to cure my weak|ne&s;s
<PB N="213" REF="020309_0213_0FAEF8C0C5EAD4E0">
and infirmities, and at the la&s;t to &s;ave me, and make me an heir of his eternal kingdom, what is the con&s;e|quence of this love? Why, the next re&s;olve mu&s;t be this; I will either rebel again&s;t his grace, and re&s;i&s;t his pow|er, or I will &s;ubmit to him; which of the&s;e is the be&s;t way, the &s;afe&s;t way?</P>
<P>Are there not a great many in this age, that are as &s;en&s;ible of the workings of God's grace for their conver|&s;ion, as ever you and I were; that are as &s;en&s;ible that God hath called them to holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, as any of us can be, and yet they have re&s;i&s;ted the grace of God? They have &s;aid in their hearts, we will not &s;ub|mit to this power, that will make us &s;o holy, and &s;o watchful, and &s;o careful, diligent and obedient, for this very rea&s;on, becau&s;e it will cro&s;s my intere&s;t, it will cro&s;s my plea&s;ure, it will hinder my preferment in the world, and my reputation among men; and for this rea&s;on I will not bear this yoke. I would be glad to hope there are none &s;uch here, that have made &s;uch <HI>a covenant with death and hell,</HI> and yielded them&s;elves up to the devil, to &s;erve him all their days.</P>
<P>Let us, who are at this time, and at this meeting, under the operation of God's grace, and feel the Lord calling us by his grace, and working upon us by his &s;pirit; let us enter together into a holy, &s;olemn re&s;olution, that we will obey this good Spirit, and take him for our leader, and &s;ub|mit, though it &s;hould be to a cro&s;s: Thus people will think, they Will come to this re&s;olution, when the work of redemp|tion is begun in their &s;ouls, and when they are convinced of their &s;in, and their eyes are opened to &s;ee the way of holine&s;s; and though they never take a re&s;olution to walk in it, yet every one &s;hall be convinced, and &s;ee there was a better way than their own, and be convinced by the grace of God one time or other, that in re&s;pect of God's working of it, it is beginning; but in re&s;pect of men that &s;hould join with the operation of God, it is not beginning, for he hath no de&s;ire to tho&s;e things which he doth not know, he &s;till depends upon him&s;elf; but when the &s;oul comes to be &s;atisfied, that it is the vi&s;itation of God, and joins him&s;elf to him in a holy re&s;ignation of his own will, and &s;aith, this is the Lord, he
<PB N="214" REF="020309_0214_0FAEF8C2C3F01A38">
is come to work upon me, he is come to change and alter the frame of my mind: It is the Lord, let him do what he will; here is a mind brought to &s;ubmit to the grace of God, God is able to do that for him which he cannot do for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>When people come to the right object of their faith, and act their faith upon that object, they every day find a pro|gre&s;s, a going forward in the work of grace, according to the work of grace in their &s;ouls; and there is a power that in|clines them to believe; it is not for &s;uch to cry, if they had power, they would do more; he that hath the &s;pirit of grace, the Spirit of Chri&s;t, that had <HI>all power in Heaven and Earth given</HI> to him, to put it forth on purpo&s;e for the bring|ing back of men and women home to God; he that hath this object of faith before him, he will not look for power in his own will and affections to redeem him, he expects a power to be daily mini&s;tered and di&s;pen&s;ed to him, as he hath need of it, through the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is pre|&s;ent with him, in all his trials and temptations: He cries, here is a temptation that will carry me away, O Lord help me, <HI>put forth the arm of thy power and &s;ave me,</HI> plant thy fear in my heart and deliver me, <HI>their eyes &s;hall &s;ee their Saviour,</HI> &s;aith the prophet.</P>
<P>Thus when a man comes to be joined to the right ob|ject of faith, and doth exerci&s;e and put forth lively acts of faith upon Chri&s;t, his eyes &s;hall &s;ee his Saviour; the light that &s;hines into his heart, di&s;covers to him the temp|tation, and it al&s;o &s;hews him a Reedemer at hand; his Saviour is nigh him, and he tru&s;teth in him, and relies upon him, and &s;ays, this word of God is in my heart, and I do really believe, that although the temptation that a&s;|&s;aults me be &s;trong, yet it &s;hall not prevail; whether it be the profits, the plea&s;ures, or the honours of the world. If I put my tru&s;t in this power, I cannot go near the evil; I am a Chri&s;tian; I have entered into a covenant in Chri&s;|tianity, that I will join with nothing but what God ap|proves of: Now when I have repre&s;ented to my mind the temptation of the devil, and that evil which he &s;ets before me, and I know it is contrary to the mind of God, how can I go into that evil, and break my covenant with
<PB N="215" REF="020309_0215_0FAEF8C4B84B29D0">
God, after I have entered into covenant with him, to love him, &s;erve him, and obey him? The power of grace up|on &s;uch &s;ouls, the operation of grace, is &s;o powerful, that the temptation comes and goes, and they are &s;aved and delivered out of it, becau&s;e God helpeth them; but if they comply with the temptation, then <HI>tribulation, wrath and angui&s;h,</HI> pur&s;ues all &s;uch as are rebellious and di&s;o|bedient to the will of God.</P>
<P>Now this redemption is carried on gradually from day to day; the truth that thou believe&s;t, it operates by de|grees; thou art delivered, fir&s;t from one evil practice, and then from another evil work: But there is a great deal more; thou rejoice&s;t and art glad, that thou art deli|vered from one &s;in; but thou woulde&s;t be more glad to be delivered from them all. I &s;peak to tho&s;e that are &s;erious for their immortal &s;ouls; when they &s;ee them|&s;elves delivered out of one evil, that they were ready to run into, they would be glad if they were redeemed out of every evil; that their cro&s;&s;ne&s;s and peevi&s;hne&s;s, their frowardne&s;s and wantonne&s;s were removed: They &s;hould be glad to be delivered from all their &s;ins.</P>
<P>What do you think, &s;ay &s;ome, that a man, while he liveth here, may come to &s;ee all &s;in, all evil and cor|ruption brought under, and nothing but holine&s;s, righte|ou&s;ne&s;s and truth remain in him; and that there &s;hall be nothing but &s;implicity and innocence? Do you think that &s;uch a thing can be?</P>
<P>Why &s;hould not I think &s;o? You will grant me, that the power of grace is able to get &s;uch power and victory over &s;in and corruption, that you may come to hate it as much as ever you have loved it; if you grant me that, the con&s;equence will follow, he that gave me victory over &s;in, can give me power over all &s;in. All Chri&s;tians be|lieve, that God's power is infinite; the &s;cripture te&s;tifies, <HI>all things to be po&s;&s;ible to God, with whom we have to do.</HI> If all things be po&s;&s;ible to God, &s;ure this is po&s;&s;ible; there is nothing &s;o contrary to God as &s;in; and God will not &s;uffer the devil always to rule his ma&s;ter-piece, man. Mankind is God's ma&s;ter-piece, the mo&s;t eminent creature in this lower world, made after God's likene&s;s; and though
<PB N="216" REF="020309_0216_0FAEF8C55BBDE208">
the devil hath brought men into his own likene&s;s now, yet nothing can be more contrary to the mind of God, than that the devil &s;hould have the rule of us, for God would have the government of us him&s;elf.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider the infinitene&s;s of God's power, for de&s;troying that which is contrary to him, who can believe that the devil mu&s;t ever &s;tand and prevail? I belive it is in|con&s;i&s;tent and di&s;agreeable with the true faith, for people to be Chri&s;tians, and yet to believe that Chri&s;t, the eternal Son of God, to whom all power in Heaven and Earth is given, will &s;uffer &s;in and the devil to have dominion over them; <HI>there is no other name under Heaven by which I can be &s;aved,</HI> therefore I have put my confidence in him: If the devil mu&s;t have the rule of me here, then I cannot be &s;ubject to Chri&s;t in all things; I may go to meetings, but can never ma&s;ter the devil and his temptations; this is as incon&s;i&s;tent with the faith of a Chri&s;tian, as light with darkne&s;s, and Chri&s;t with <HI>Belial.</HI> If Chri&s;tians think them&s;elves true believers, then let them &s;ee how far their faith will reach, whether it be like that faith, <HI>which was once delivered to the &s;aints,</HI> for by that faith their hearts were clean&s;ed, and they became free from &s;in, <HI>Rom.</HI> vi. 22. <HI>But now being made free from &s;in, and the &s;ervants of God,</HI> &s;aith the apo&s;tle, <HI>you have your fruit unto holine&s;s, and the end everla&s;ting life;</HI> you were &s;ervants to &s;in, but now you are free from &s;in; &s;o that this faith is but one, and if men have got another, it will do them no good: Take heed thou art not mi&s;taken about thy faith.</P>
<P>I have heard &s;ome learned men &s;ay, that a believer is a &s;ervant of &s;in, and he is ever like to be &s;o; but he is not at the &s;ame time free from righteou&s;ne&s;s, for he hath the righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t imputed to him, and God looks upon him as righteous in his righteou&s;ne&s;s; there cannot be a more anti-apo&s;tolical doctrine, I may be a &s;ervant of &s;in, and yet have the imputation of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s; I may be a &s;ervant of &s;in, &s;ay they, yet Chri&s;t is righteous, he is the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, and he <HI>hath fulfilled the will of God, and hath purcha&s;ed &s;alvation</HI> for me, and he is the object by which I am made righteous.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider this, the imputation of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="217" REF="020309_0217_0FAEF8C61112A2D0">
will never do me good, till I come to partake of his righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, till his righteou&s;ne&s;s be made my righteou&s;ne&s;s, in me and for me. Chri&s;t is made <HI>to us of God, wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification and redemption;</HI> &s;o that if a &s;in|ner, one that was a &s;inner the other day, come, through faith in Chri&s;t, to have his heart clean&s;ed and purged, and true righ|teou&s;ne&s;s planted in him, where &s;in was planted, there &s;in, through the blood of Chri&s;t, is clean&s;ed and purged away.</P>
<P>So that Chri&s;t is made righteou&s;ne&s;s to me, and not his righteou&s;ne&s;s barely imputed and reckoned to me; <HI>Chri&s;t is my wi&s;dom,</HI> I am a fool without him; Chri&s;t is made <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s to me;</HI> for my good deeds and holy living cannot be acceptable to God till they be done in him, and commended to God by him; the proper work of faith is, to fix the &s;oul on him that <HI>worketh all things in us and for us, that worketh in us both to will and to do, according to his good plea&s;ure;</HI> and it is the good plea&s;ure of God that we &s;hould live in all righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>They that come to receive this faith at fir&s;t, have to receive it from an inward feeling; they have the ope|ration of the word of God in them; &s;o the apo&s;tle reck|ons faith, not becau&s;e &s;uch a man heareth, and &s;uch a man believeth what &s;uch a man preacheth, but <HI>faith is the operation of God;</HI> you may hear me, and a thou&s;and preach, and you may die unbelievers for all that, except you come to this, to know the operation of God, and the work of faith in you. How doth my heart clo&s;e with this? How doth my &s;oul join with this? What virtue and power do I feel in my&s;elf? it may be others that preach, feel the power, but do I feel it? if not, I come but to a noi&s;e and &s;ound: If people feel not their hearts joining with the word preached, there comes no advantage to them; you read in &s;cripture, that <HI>the word preached did not profit, be|cau&s;e it was not mixed with faith in them that heard it:</HI> This is your ca&s;e, you come to meeting, and you love to hear the doctrine of truth preached; I tell you, and I will &s;peak plainly to you, unle&s;s you come to feel the operation of the word of truth in your hearts, you may hear the go&s;pel, and the word of life preached to you, but it will not profit you much.</P>

Alas! if they did all concur together, and did preach as certain and infallible doctrine as ever Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles preached, this will all do thee and me no good, unle&s;s we know the power.

it will, you mu&s;t follow your intere&s;t; there wants &s;ome|what to fix you in the principle of truth, which is able to &s;anctify you and perfect you, that you may be reconciled to God through Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>They that are re&s;igned and given up to truth, it is po&s;&s;ible for them that they may be &s;atisfied; they have an infallible te&s;timony <HI>of the &s;pirit of truth witne&s;&s;ing with their &s;pirits,</HI> that &s;uch a thing is bad, and if they might get the whole world to do it, they will not.

They are for profit and plea&s;ure, which they may have with a good con&s;cience. Tho&s;e things which God affords them as ble&s;&s;ings in this world, they de&s;pi&s;e them not, but take them with thank&s;giving, and u&s;e them for his glory: But if they cannot have profit or plea&s;ure without &s;inning again&s;t the Lord and their own con&s;ciences, let tho&s;e who will, take profit and plea&s;ure.</P>

This is the mind of the Lord; God hath &s;ignified it by his Spi|rit, and &s;ealed it upon my &s;pirit, and I cannot but know it.</P>
<P>What, do you profe&s;s infallibility? Yes, el&s;e I would hold my tongue; if I did not know what I a&s;&s;ert infalli|bly, I would never preach more; truth may be many times concealed. A man may have wronged and cheated his neighbour, and he not know of it; this man goes away, and his neighbour doth not reproach him; but when he comes to lie down in his bed, he hath a &s;ting and a reproach in his con&s;cience, I know I have done him harm. Is not this infallible? Let me con&s;ult &s;ome learned men, that I may know whether I have told a lie. I need not go to learned men and logicians, to know whether it was a lie; I am infallible in this, I know certainly it was not

a lie; I have a certain evidence, and if a thou&s;and men tell me to the contrary, I will not believe them. If there be infallibility here, is there not then infallibility in the word of truth? Shall I que&s;tion it, or doubt it, if I have an infallible te&s;timony of it?</P>
<P>Tho' men have ever &s;o little proficiency, if they have it upon &s;ure terms, and la&s;ting foundations, let a thou&s;and men come with all their logical skill and &s;ophi&s;m, yet they can never remove a man from the witne&s;s in him&s;elf. The remnant that God hath brought to this foundation, they have a certainty and infallibility in their obedience, that they pay to the will of God, and in the comfort they have to the obedience of the law of God, <HI>which he hath written in their hearts.</HI> Let what will come, they can ne|ver be removed; for this exceeds all the precepts and doctrines of men; it is the precept and doctrine of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles. Let people read them, and endeavour to practi&s;e them: But here comes the te&s;timony, the di|vine power by which the precept was given forth to them, and is now given forth again to thee and me, with the &s;ame liveline&s;s and power. Let us perform them as did the primitive Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Here now, comfort comes to flow forth from a &s;ettled foundation that &s;hall never be moved. The winds have come and blown upon religion; let what wind will blow, that can blow, God hath built his church upon a rock, and it will remain unmoveable again&s;t all oppo&s;ition; ble&s;|&s;ed are they that are founded thereupon. Hath God fixed and e&s;tabli&s;hed us in our &s;ociety with one another, and with our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t? this is the foundation that God hath placed it upon. We de&s;ire that all men may come to the &s;ame &s;tability and &s;ettlement, and never more to be <HI>to&s;&s;ed with the winds of doctrine, but be built upon Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Rock of Ages,</HI> the rock of our ages, the rock of us and our children. That God will carry us on in this &s;ociety, is the de&s;ire of our &s;ouls, for our&s;elves, and all our friends and countrymen. The way for you to be ble&s;&s;ed, and to have an advantage for your immor|tal &s;ouls, by the te&s;timony that hath been rai&s;ed up, is, to have regard to the working of the &s;ame power, that

<P>MOST ble&s;&s;ed and glorious God and Father of Life! how wonderful art thou in thy appearances to thy peo|ple in the day of thy power, in which thou ha&s;t &s;tretched forth thine arm, and ha&s;t gathered a remnant of tho&s;e that were &s;cat|tered, and art yet gathering and bringing to thy&s;elf, tho&s;e that have been driven away; and thou ha&s;t made known thy power and goodne&s;s in the hearts of the &s;ons and daughters of men, that they might love thee. That thou mighte&s;t beget love to thy&s;elf, thou ha&s;t made known thy love to their hearts; if thou had&s;t not loved us fir&s;t, we had never loved thee: But thou ha&s;t been &s;hedding abroad thy love in our hearts by the Holy Gho&s;t, to con&s;train us to love thee. Thy love is mani|fe&s;ted to all that are breathing after thee, and none do breathe after thee, but through the life that thou give&s;t them; and tho&s;e that were dead in &s;ins and tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, ha&s;t thou quickened, and we would &s;end forth thy prai&s;es and thank&s;givings for the great things thou ha&s;t done for us in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. All thy works prai&s;e thee, and thy &s;aints ble&s;s thee.</P>
<P>Holy Father of Life! encrea&s;e and multiply tho&s;e graces and holy de&s;ires which thou ha&s;t begun to work in us, and pluck up every plant that thy right hand hath not planted. Let &s;piritual <HI>Sodom</HI> be burnt up, and all that are corrupt; let tho&s;e things that thou ha&s;t planted &s;pring up to the prai&s;e of thy name, and the &s;alvation of the &s;ouls which thou ha&s;t ga|thered.</P>
<P>O powerful God of Life! let thy ble&s;&s;ed pre&s;ence and liv|ing fear be among us, that all thy children may offer prai&s;es, and the &s;acrifices of humble thank&s;givings upon thy holy altar.</P>
<P>Ari&s;e, O Lord! more and more in the greatne&s;s of thy pow|er, and di&s;pel the clouds of darkne&s;s that hath been upon the &s;ons and daughters of men, and rai&s;e up in every one of us more and more holy de&s;ires and breathings after that life that is eternal. Tho&s;e that have been &s;cattered, let them be now gathered, and let tho&s;e that have been driven away in a cloudy

<HEAD>SERMON XX. The <HI>WORD</HI> of <HI>GOD,</HI> a <HI>CHRISTIAN'S LIFE.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Preached at GRACE-CHURCH-STREET, <DATE>March 14, 1687.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>IT was the doctrine of the great ma&s;ter of the Chri&s;|tian religion, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, while he was preaching and publi&s;hing, and making known the way of &s;alvation among the &s;ons and daughters of men; he then preached and declared, that it was <HI>not bread only by which a man lived, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</HI> Now the way and means of man's pre&s;ervation in life, in a living &s;tate, the method and cour&s;e that the God of Heaven doth open to keep the &s;ons and daughters of men alive, is by this word: <HI>Every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God,</HI> hath a mini&s;tration of life in it; and, therefore, all that are de&s;irous of the enjoyment of the immortal life, and of the pre&s;erving and encrea&s;ing of it, they are diligently to wait to be made partakers of this divine mini&s;tration. Outward bread is for outward pre|&s;ervation, but man is made inward as well as outward, he hath a &s;oul as well as a body. Now Chri&s;t, to &s;ignify to us, what the inward man is nouri&s;hed and fed by, tells us, that <HI>man liveth not by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</HI></P>
<P>So now in this our day, as well as in former days, it hath plea&s;ed God to give unto a remnant an experimental knowledge of the truth of this; that they have been
<PB N="223" REF="020309_0223_0FAEF8CD735C4508">
quickened and made alive by the word of God; that is, they <HI>have heard, and felt, and ta&s;ted of the word of life that was with the Father before the world began,</HI> that hath been divinely mini&s;tred to them, by the mercy of God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t; many <HI>that were dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, he hath &s;aid unto them, live.</HI> He hath given unto many an inward &s;en&s;e of their &s;tate, who &s;ome|times had it not; he hath brought many a one to feel &s;in to be a burthen and an oppre&s;&s;ing load, who &s;ome|times before have taken plea&s;ure and delight in it. This is a great change that is wrought in a man's mind, that he &s;hould come to be laden with that, burthened and oppre&s;&s;ed by that, which was before his plea&s;ure and delight; yet this great change with been wrought in many a &s;oul, by the operation of the word of God, of that inward word, that inward voice, when the Lord hath taken men in hand him&s;elf.</P>
<P>There are many have taken &s;inners in hand, and have gone about to convince them and convert them, but they were not able to do it; but when the Lord hath taken men in hand him&s;elf, when his Creator hath undertaken to deal with him him&s;elf, then the man cries out, <HI>I am a worm, and no man;</HI> then he cries out under the &s;en&s;e of the judgment of God, then he cries out under the indignation of the Lord, which he hath kindled by his &s;ins, he cries out for mercy, then he prays for remi&s;&s;ion, then he wi&s;hes that he had never pro|voked the Lord; for the word that goes out of the mouth of God, hath a mighty force and power upon the &s;pirit of a man, &s;o that he is converted and changed by it; as the pro|phet &s;aid of old, <HI>the word of God is pure, converting the &s;oul.</HI></P>
<P>Now where any come to an experimental knowledge of the word of the Lord, of this inward voice, whereby God &s;peaks to the &s;ons and daughters of men, they have received thereby an infallible feeling of their own &s;tate and condition; this is the fir&s;t le&s;&s;on learned by it. They come to have a certain, infallible knowledge of their own &s;tate, and they are &s;ure that they cannot be deceived; for it brings an evi|dence with it in their con&s;ciences, &s;o that what&s;oever this word of life &s;ignifieth to a man, he hath the knowledge of the &s;ame thing evidencing it in his own con&s;cience, as the apo&s;|tle
<PB N="224" REF="020309_0224_0FAEF8CD94B50298">
&s;aith, <HI>if our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts, and knoweth all things.</HI> Now here is a way found out for men to obtain divine knowledge by a divine means; for the Lord &s;peaks by his Spirit, and if men come to hearken to that voice, unto that &s;peaking, they perceive readily what it &s;aith unto them: The Lord tells people as well now as in former ages, what he hath again&s;t them; and this every one in the clo&s;et of their own hearts, come to under&s;tand. We read in the book of <HI>Revelations,</HI> what our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t appointed <HI>John</HI> to write to the &s;even churches in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> that he had <HI>few things</HI> again&s;t &s;ome, and <HI>many things</HI> again&s;t others.</P>
<P>Now that which is the de&s;ign of our meeting when we are a&s;&s;embled together, is, that we may know what the mind and judgment of God is, concerning our&s;elves: How &s;hall we know that, unle&s;s we ask him, and come to wait upon him, and enquire at the oracle of coun&s;el, that God hath appointed in the bo&s;om of every man? For he &s;ignifies his mind unto the children of men, by that light and grace which Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath planted in them, he hath <HI>enlightened every man that comes into the world,</HI> with an undeceiving light, and he <HI>hath mini&s;tered of his truth</HI> and grace to every man; though the man be bad and untrue, and in the dark, and there be darkne&s;s in him, yet <HI>the light &s;hineth in darkne&s;s.</HI> The man may be a fal&s;e man, yet there is true knowledge in him; if this man hearken to the voice of truth, when the God of truth &s;ignifies what his mind and judgment is con|cerning him, and his pre&s;ent &s;tate.</P>
<P>So that there is an opportunity offered, and if a man be|lieve the word of truth, which is admini&s;tered to his own mind, he cannot &s;ay &s;uch a man hath deceived him, for it is truth it&s;elf which is &s;ignified to him which he believeth: For the truth is the object of his faith, and he believeth it of him&s;elf; he believe<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> that while he remains wicked in his unrenewed &s;tate, he is out of the covenant of God, and in the high road to de&s;truction, if he doth not get out of it, and return to God, and mind his duty: He believeth this, and he believeth the truth: It hath been &s;o with many, it hath been &s;o with us all; this is the fir&s;t kind of faith and belief that ever we receive; for when truth &s;ignifieth to us
<PB N="225" REF="020309_0225_0FAEF8CEABC19960">
our fallen &s;tate, our alienated &s;tate, when truth &s;ignifies and di&s;covers to us the partition wall of &s;in and iniquity which we have builded up, whereby the glory and favour of God was hid from the &s;oul, we believed this to be true; we would have been looked upon as heirs of God's kingdom, yet when we are come to hearken to truth, we find that we are children of the devil and do his works; &s;hall a man believe this after he hath been forty years a profe&s;&s;or of Chri&s;tianity? If a man believe truth, there is no danger in believing it, tho' it be his own de&s;truction that is threatened.</P>
<P>Now the great thing that I would have u&s;hered into the hearts of men, is, that they may believe the truth for truth's &s;ake. If men will believe the truth, they mu&s;t believe many things again&s;t them&s;elves, which they are not willing to believe; but &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>no man can be my</HI> &s;cholar, my <HI>di&s;ciple, but by denying him&s;elf.</HI> I mu&s;t deny my&s;elf, my preten&s;ions to Chri&s;tianity, my &s;uppo&s;ed &s;aint&s;hip and title to the kingdom of God; now if I would be convinced that I am a wicked man, a pro|phane man, one that doth not live as becomes the go&s;pel, I mu&s;t believe truth, the voice of truth being of infallible certainty; it is &s;ignified divinely, by the immortal word that cannot deceive us; this ought to be the rea&s;on why people &s;hould believe the te&s;timony of it, tho' it be again&s;t them&s;elves; they that do &s;o, pre&s;ently come to find the effects of it, for they were in their &s;ins and tre&s;pa&s;&s;es before, and &s;o are &s;till; they were before in a kind of liberty, in a kind of ea&s;e and indulgence of them&s;elves, and &s;till their &s;in remains in them, and they remain in it; but they are now under a &s;en&s;e of &s;orrow, under a weight, under a burthen, under an oppre&s;&s;ion, which &s;ignifies they are alive, and quickened; for (if you take an outward compari&s;on) they remain not &s;en&s;ele&s;s and dead; now lay what load you will upon a dead man, he will neither groan, nor grumble at it; but if becomes again to life, he cries take off the burthen, the weight and oppre&s;&s;ion, that lies heavy upon me.</P>
<P>This is the difference between being <HI>dead in &s;ins and tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es,</HI> and being brought to life and &s;en&s;e again; this word of life that comes from the mouth of God, begets a &s;en&s;e in every one that receiveth it; it is of great &s;ervice and u&s;e
<PB N="226" REF="020309_0226_0FAEF8CF166D2E30">
to all people to be acquainted with it, that de&s;ire to be <HI>heirs of life eternal,</HI> that de&s;ire to be <HI>inheritors of the kingdom of God:</HI> But how &s;hould they come by it? They think by this and the other duty, and temporary performance, to obtain it; no, but if they will have life, they mu&s;t have it from the God of life that created them, he mu&s;t <HI>create</HI> them <HI>again to good works:</HI> They can have it but by one way, all mu&s;t be brought to it that way; it cannot be by hearing a man preach; unle&s;s the &s;pirit doth co-operate with the word of God, there is no po&s;&s;ibility of being quickened, and nece&s;&s;ity binds me to hearken and have regard to that one means: <HI>Now I &s;ay to you,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t, &s;peaking of people's way of living to eter|nity, <HI>man liveth not by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God;</HI> now when we come to under&s;tand this text, as &s;poken by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, we did conclude there was a po&s;&s;ibility of under&s;tanding and hearing that inward voice and word of truth in our own hearts, that God did &s;peak to us by his Son, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who enlightened us. Hereupon meetings were appointed at fir&s;t, that the word &s;hould mini&s;ter life in them, and life to them that attend them; and to this day our meetings are ap|pointed for this purpo&s;e, that we may have the mini&s;tration of life and virtue, from Chri&s;t, the fountain of life and vir|tue, by whom we were to be quickened and &s;trengthened, and by whom <HI>tho&s;e that are dead in &s;ins and tre&s;pa&s;&s;es were quickened.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore I would have every one always to have a reve|rence to the word of life, that &s;peaks in them&s;elves; for, if we &s;peak as we are <HI>moved by the Spirit of God,</HI> and utter tho&s;e things by verbal te&s;timony, which God hath made known to us; if you have not an oracle in your bo&s;oms, if you do not at the &s;ame time perceive an echo of truth in your own &s;ouls, this will do you no good, but be an empty &s;ound which will pa&s;s away again; but the mind that is &s;e|rious and &s;ettled, in waiting upon God with an earne&s;t de|&s;ire, that it may receive benefit in going to this and the other meeting; &s;uch a one will &s;ay, I pray God ble&s;s this opportunity to me, that &s;o I may receive benefit to my &s;oul. Where people meet in this manner, they have not only an admini&s;tration of doctrine from without, from this and the
<PB N="227" REF="020309_0227_0FAEF8D0A5C3A5F8">
other in&s;trument, <HI>but they have a mini&s;tration of the word of God in them&s;elves, by which a man liveth.</HI></P>
<P>Let us not be led and hurried away with the grand error of the times, the great error of this age, and of the ages by|pa&s;t, that there is no po&s;&s;ibility for people to under&s;tand and hear this voice of God, this inward voice. There are, &s;ay they, no immediate teachings now-a-days, no in&s;pirations now-a-days; they might as well &s;ay, that there are no conver|&s;ions now-a-days. I will prove it from the holy &s;criptures, that there is no man in this age, is like to be converted to God, or redeemed from his iniquity, and brought to the knowledge of his Maker, unle&s;s he have it by the inward working of the eternal God: Not by man's preaching and in&s;truction, nor by reading all the good &s;ermons that ever were preached, without the co-operation of the holy &s;anctify|ing Spirit, which begets life in them that believe; and if the&s;e men &s;ay none can be converted, then we mu&s;t all go headlong to hell, even they and all.</P>
<P>The&s;e Quakers may &s;ay what they will, there is no imme|diate teaching now-a-days, no man can know the mind of God, nor under&s;tand the &s;criptures; none can open them to you.</P>
<P>But, ble&s;&s;ed be God, this darkne&s;s is removed; this veil is gone over and taken away; the brightne&s;s of the glory of the go&s;pel hath expelled this darkne&s;s, and thou&s;ands now-a-days do not only hear the mini&s;ter reprove them, but they hear a voice within that doth reprove them for iniquity; and they find and feel a judgment and tribunal within them&s;elves, and that God hath an immediate way of coun&s;elling and in&s;tructing them if they will hearken to him.</P>
<P>You that are under any &s;en&s;e of this, that are come to &s;uch an inward &s;en&s;e of the operation of the word of God, if you have heard it reprove you, exhort you, judge you and condemn you, con&s;ider that this <HI>word</HI> proceeded <HI>out of the mouth of God,</HI> and not out of the mouth of any man. You hear the &s;entence of God upon you in your own con&s;ciences: Whence comes it? This is out of the mouth of God. Every word that comes out of the mouth of God, admini&s;ters life, &s;en&s;e and conviction; and you feel it and receive it, and
<PB N="228" REF="020309_0228_0FAEF8D152EF9860">
you may have a more familiar acquaintance with it. There is not a day or hour that pa&s;&s;es over your heads nor mine, but if we attend to this inward voice, we may know what it &s;peaks to us, by its coun&s;els, doctrines, reproofs, con|victions and illuminations; <HI>for the Spirit &s;peaketh expre&s;sly,</HI> with an expre&s;s &s;ignification, unto the &s;pirit of man; and if he be under a temptation to tell a lie, and he comes to a little pau&s;e or que&s;tion, whether he &s;hall tell it or no; if he hearken to this inward word he will not pau&s;e long about it, but &s;uch a &s;entence will ari&s;e in him, as that in <HI>Jo&s;eph, how can I do this great wickedne&s;s, and &s;in again&s;t God?</HI> How can I &s;peak a lie, tell a lie, when in &s;o doing I &s;in again&s;t God? Here is a &s;entence of truth, wilt thou receive it or no? No &s;aye&s;t thou, I will venture to tell a lie; then &s;halt thou come into the rank of them that do <HI>de&s;pite to the Spirit of grace, and trample under foot the Son of God, and count the blood of the covenant an unholy thing.</HI> What &s;entence &s;uch &s;hall have, at the latter end, you may read at large in the holy &s;criptures.</P>
<P>Now there is a great nece&s;&s;ity that every one be per&s;uaded to hearken to this voice, not only at a meeting, but on all occa&s;ions they have in the world. I hope I &s;peak to many &s;erious and religious per&s;ons that are enquiring about their immortal &s;ouls, what may be be&s;t for their &s;ouls, whether it is better to go on in wickedne&s;s, or leave off; and that re&s;olve and &s;ay, I would be glad to leave my &s;ins as well as you, if I had power, and to live a holy life. As for the want of power, (that you have not power) I do not wonder at it; for until you come to an exerci&s;e of faith, in that which hath empowered the people of God, in all ages, I wonder not that you have not power. You &s;ay I am &s;o weak, that I am overcome before I am aware; the devil is &s;o &s;ubtile and cunning with his temptations, that I am &s;urprized and &s;natched into temptations, and overcome with evil before I am aware: <HI>He is like a roaring lion, go|ing about continually, &s;eeking whom he may devour.</HI> But whom can he devour? Can he devour tho&s;e that hearken and &s;ubmit to the word of God? If he could, then none could e&s;cape him; if the devil could pluck out of God's hands, then nobody would go to Heaven, nor never &s;hall, if he have power.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="020309_0229_0FAEF8D215372ED0">Where the devil finds any in their own hands, as &s;uppo&s;e a religious per&s;on of this and the other religion, who never experienced any thing of this power of God, but tru&s;teth to his duties and performances, this man is in his own hand; now &s;uch a one the tempter hath power over: He can make him cheat his neighbour, and lead him into drunkenne&s;s and uncleanne&s;s &s;ometimes, and into the greate&s;t abomina|tions; but if a man come into the exerci&s;e of faith and dependence upon God, and hath left tru&s;ting in him&s;elf and &s;aith, I &s;ee I cannot pre&s;erve my&s;elf from &s;in, I &s;ee a nece&s;&s;ity of putting my tru&s;t in the Lord, and of waiting upon God's power to keep me: If the tempter come to &s;uch a one, he cannot prevail, all the devils in hell cannot &s;tir him one jot; the devil may tempt him, but he &s;tands in the power of faith; he knows his name, and &s;aith, <HI>get thee behind me &s;atan;</HI> when the devil comes before him, and lays a temptation before him, he ca&s;ts it behind him; if the devil ri&s;e up again&s;t him, he can chain him down, he can &s;ay in the name of the Lord, <HI>get thee behind me &s;atan.</HI></P>

<P>There is &s;omething that keeps us; the devil is not &s;o bad to tempt, but we are as bad in our own inclinations to yield to him; <HI>the heart is deceitful above all things, and de&s;perately wicked; who can know it?</HI> There is more wick|edne&s;s in it, than can be uttered.

<P>The rea&s;on why &s;ome people are led into temptation &s;ome|times, and re&s;i&s;t it, is becau&s;e &s;ometimes the temptation &s;uits not their inclination; &s;ometimes the reputation lies in the way, &s;ometimes one thing, &s;ometimes another: But when a thing they are tempted to, &s;uits their profit and plea&s;ure, then away with the fear of God, and nothing &s;hall hinder them; I will have my plea&s;ure.</P>

<P>Thus when any one &s;uffers him&s;elf to be led away with the evil one, when he feels after that a remor&s;e upon his own heart, he finds a &s;ecret judgment and tribunal &s;et up in his own bo&s;om, again&s;t whoredom, lying, drunkenne&s;s, fraud and other &s;ins, he knows be hath done ami&s;s; he is not going to a confe&s;&s;or, that will take off and remove the guilt from his con&s;cience; he hath offended the maje&s;ty of the great God, and God hath &s;ignified it to him, is not judgment come, and hath not God &s;et it up in his own heart?

<P>My friends, this comes near to many of your &s;tates; many of you have heard long, and have heard the &s;peak|able word of God, that which could be uttered, that which could be &s;poken forth, by the demon&s;tration of the Holy Gho&s;t, by them <HI>that have received it of the Father;</HI> this you have heard long, and yet there are many of you, that if you come to a &s;erious &s;earch, you will find a want; you will &s;till find that you have not that &s;atisfaction that puts you beyond doubt, beyond fear; there is &s;omething that &s;tands in the way, that hinders your enjoyment of the un&s;peakable glory of the un&s;peakable word, and this will never be removed, but by your innocent &s;ubmitting to the work of the power of God in your own hearts, that &s;o you may not only be believers, but come to be
<PB N="236" REF="020309_0236_0FAEF8D86F4AD790">
really baptized, and then all is out of doubt; for our Lord &s;aid, <HI>he that believeth, and is baptized, &s;hall be &s;av|ed;</HI> he doth not &s;ay he may be &s;aved; but, he &s;hall be &s;aved,</P>
<P>Woful experience hath told us in our days, that a great many have believed the truth, and yet they are never like to be &s;aved, they <HI>have made &s;hipwreck of their faith;</HI> but if they had been baptized, if they would have endured the bapti&s;m, if they would have been buried with Chri&s;t in bapti&s;m, they &s;hould have been &s;aved, every one of them; and now there are a great many that remain in the belief of the truth, and yet they are not baptized, they are not dead, not buried, notwith&s;tanding <HI>they have received like precious faith with us,</HI> that <HI>faith which is of the operation of God,</HI> and that <HI>is like precious</HI> in its nature to all that do receive it, and would work the &s;ame effect in all too, if it were not ob&s;tructed; but notwith&s;tanding they have received faith towards the &s;aving of their &s;ouls, yet their &s;ouls are captives, their &s;ouls are &s;ubject to lu&s;ts, and plea&s;ures, and vanities, and unto empty and fooli&s;h things, and to pa&s;&s;ions and corruptions, after they have received faith.</P>
<P>For if you take one that is a believer of truth, that is overtaken with his lu&s;t, and pa&s;&s;ions, and corruptions, he will commonly own that he believeth the contrary, he believeth that the&s;e things &s;hould not be, that it ought to be otherwi&s;e: This is the &s;ignification of truth again&s;t untruth; if it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e, why is it thus then? Why, he finds a life to &s;pring up in that which is cor|ruptible, that is always contrary to the life of God, and at enmity with it: What &s;hall I do? I believe the truth, I know it is an holy thing, it leads all that &s;ubmit to it to a holy life, and there is this and that unholy thing, this and that corrupt thing remains, what &s;hall I do?</P>
<P>It is an evident demon&s;tration that thou wante&s;t the bapti&s;m of him in <HI>whom thou believe&s;t;</HI> thou ha&s;t believed in Chri&s;t Je&s;us that cometh after <HI>John,</HI> and was before him; and now having believed in him, thou wante&s;t to be baptized by him, and for want of that, the pollution and corruption that was in thy nature in the time of thy
<PB N="237" REF="020309_0237_0FAEF8D8E8B32C98">
alienation, prevails &s;till upon thee, contrary to thy faith; and there is no coming to obtain this bapti&s;m, but by &s;inking down into that which will &s;lay thee, that which will kill thee: But there is &s;uch a &s;hifting to &s;ave ones life, there are &s;o many twi&s;tings and twinings of people to &s;ave their lives, that at la&s;t they lo&s;e them; but there are none that could ever find that life that is eternal, but tho&s;e that are willing to be given up to the dead, and &s;ubmit to this bapti&s;m, that is, by the Holy Gho&s;t and by fire: The&s;e only do come to life, they come to the re&s;urrection, for you never knew any that died this death but they ro&s;e again; it is as impo&s;&s;ible for death to hold any one down that is buried in this bapti&s;m, as it was impo&s;&s;ible to hold Chri&s;t down, when he was in the grave; <HI>the &s;ame power that brought again our Lord Chri&s;t from the dead, the &s;ame power it is that quickens us,</HI> while we remain in the&s;e mortal bodies, after we have &s;u&s;tained this death and crucifiction.</P>
<P>But who can believe this &s;aying? For <HI>this is a hard &s;aying, who can bear it?</HI> Is it not enough that I am a believer, which makes me a Friend, and entitles me to a community among you; and as long as I hold the truth, and profe&s;s the truth, I am looked upon as one of your &s;ociety? This is very true; this doth entitle people un|to the outward privileges of the Church of Chri&s;t; but there is another inner court, that lies under the angel's reed (the mea&s;uring-reed) that is to be mea&s;ured; the temple is mea&s;ured, and every wor&s;hipper in the temple is mea&s;ured; there was an outward court, that was for re|pre&s;enting the Church of God in general, from the par|ticular; the outward court was not mea&s;ured, that the Gentiles might come in; the unbaptized people, which were never regenerated, they might come &s;o far as the outward court, but this did not entitle them to the privileges of the hou&s;e of God, nor to any wor&s;hip or &s;acrifice that was accepted upon God's altar.</P>
<P>It concerns you and me, my friends, to be &s;erious about matters of this moment and importance, and not &s;pend our days, and, as it were, &s;peak by rote, under an airy profe&s;&s;ion, though of truth it&s;elf, without con&s;idering what

progre&s;s you have made, what benefit you have obtained, and whether you are come not only to <HI>the &s;hadow of good things to come,</HI> but to the very &s;ub&s;tance of the heavenly things; <HI>for the comers to the outward wor&s;hip could never, with tho&s;e &s;acrifices they offered, he made perfect; the comers thereunto were not made perfect, as to the things pertaining to the con&s;cience,</HI> &s;peaking there of the outward wor&s;hip, <HI>Heb.</HI> x, 1; but coming to the heavenly things, whereof the other was but a &s;hadow, they made people perfect, as to the con&s;cience, and did bring them to &s;al|vation. The apo&s;tle alludes to this bapti&s;m, for he &s;peaks in a figure of the <HI>eight per&s;ons that were &s;aved in</HI> Noah<HI>'s ark;</HI> then he brings down the allegory to chri&s;tian bap|ti&s;m, not only the bapti&s;m of <HI>John,</HI> the fore-runner of Chri&s;t, that preached of Chri&s;t, but to the chri&s;tian bap|ti&s;m it&s;elf; <HI>by the like figure whereof bapti&s;m now &s;aveth us,</HI> &s;aith the apo&s;tle; <HI>not the putting away of the filth of the fle&s;h, but the an&s;wer of a good con&s;cience.</HI> What doth he mean by bapti&s;m &s;aving us? He means, <HI>the an&s;wer of a good con&s;cience towards God, through the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t from the dead;</HI> &s;o that chri&s;tian bapti&s;m did bring along with it the <HI>clean&s;ing and putting away of all &s;in out of the con&s;cience,</HI> that might bring them under doubts and &s;cruples; and then there is an ari&s;ing of Je&s;us; the Saviour, in the con&s;cience, the Mediator that brought them to an&s;wer for them in the &s;ight of God; for if people be con&s;cious of &s;in, and do leave off their &s;in, this doth not yet clean&s;e the con&s;cience; for there &s;till remains a con&s;cience of &s;in; tis not the leaving off our &s;in that makes our atonement with God, or that expiates our guilt, or doth away the guilt of the &s;ins that we have committed; but there mu&s;t be a for&s;aking and a leaving off &s;in by the virtue and power of the &s;pirit, by which we are ena|bled, not only to leave off &s;in, but are guided and di|rected to the Mediator, <HI>who&s;e blood alone reconcileth us to God, and clean&s;eth us from all &s;in.</HI> If I &s;hould never com|mit a &s;in while I live, it is not this &s;imply in it&s;elf that will make me have the an&s;wer of a good con&s;cience in the &s;ight of God; for there remains the guilt of &s;in contracted in the days of unbelief, which is a bar and hinderance, that
<PB N="239" REF="020309_0239_0FAEF8DA5061FC28">
none can approach the Holy God, but in the atonement and &s;alvation that comes by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; for all that be|lieve and obey the go&s;pel are accepted in Chri&s;t, and that upon the account of Chri&s;t's precious blood, that clean&s;eth us from all &s;in and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. Whom doth it clean&s;e? Tho&s;e only that for&s;ake their &s;ins, and by his power are brought to a holy life; they, by the virtue of his pow|er, and the clean&s;ing of his blood, come to have their for|mer &s;ins removed from them, as far as the ea&s;t is from the we&s;t.</P>
<P>But what is this to them that remain in their &s;ins? what is this <HI>to them that are not baptized for the dead? that have not put off the old man, nor put on the new man,</HI> but have only put on the name and profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, and put on the out&s;ide of him, his garment, but have not put him on, they are not <HI>created again in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good works, that they might walk in them?</HI> No Wonder there remains a con&s;cience of &s;in in them, there is a bar that hinders them from the &s;ight of the glory of God, and from real and true &s;atisfaction, concerning their atone|ment and reconciliation with God, and this hinders them from the enjoyment of <HI>that peace that pa&s;&s;eth under&s;tanding;</HI> and it is no wonder, becau&s;e they are not come to this bapti&s;m that brings the <HI>an&s;wer of a good con&s;cience in the &s;ight of God;</HI> they are not ri&s;en with Chri&s;t; how &s;hould they? for they are not buried with him. <HI>Know ye not that &s;o many of us</HI> (&s;aith the apo&s;tle) <HI>as were baptized into Chri&s;t, were baptized into his death; therefore we are buried with him by bapti&s;m into death; that like as Chri&s;t was rai&s;ed from the dead by the glory of the Father, even &s;o we al&s;o &s;hould walk in newne&s;s of life,</HI> Rom. vi, 3. Here is a change figured out between them that had par|taken of the &s;piritual bapti&s;m, and were come again to the participation of life in the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and tho&s;e that were not baptized.</P>
<P>So it is now with every one that cometh to believe the truth, and make a profe&s;&s;ion of it; there is a way ca&s;t up, and there is a door opened for &s;alvation; but the grand que&s;tion that every one ought to enquire about, and put to them&s;elves, is, what progre&s;s they have made

wool, and gold and &s;ilver, and decked them&s;elves with them;</HI> but the Lord found them out, and brought them down, and took the crown from their head, and cloathed them with di&s;honour. So God doth from age to age; his judg|ments will begin at his own hou&s;e: If you would <HI>grow in the grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savi|our Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> then grow in humility and &s;elf-denial, and keep a con&s;tant watch upon your hearts; examine your hearts, and <HI>commune with your&s;elves upon your beds, and be &s;till;</HI> take heed le&s;t you &s;in again&s;t the Lord, and provoke him. <HI>There were &s;ome that provoked the Lord of old, and they committed two great evils:</HI> What be they? <HI>They have gone away, and for&s;aken the fountain of liv|ing water;</HI> as much as to &s;ay, they have not their de|pendence upon an invi&s;ible power, as they ought to have: For I am a living fountain, and it is by an invi&s;ible pow|er that I am able to coun&s;el, teach, direct, purify, and open their under&s;tandings; but they have for&s;aken me, that is one great evil; and the other is, they would not be without &s;omewhat; <HI>they have for&s;aken the Lord,</HI> and they would have &s;omewhat in&s;tead of God; <HI>they have digged to them&s;elves broken ci&s;terns, that will hold no water.</HI> And how many in this age have committed the&s;e two great evils!</P>
<P>My friends, examine your&s;elves; are there not many that have been guilty of the&s;e two great evils? They do not keep their clo&s;e dependence, tru&s;t and reliance, upon the invi&s;ible power of God, as they profe&s;s they ought to do, but are hurried away from it; &s;ome by the love of the world, &s;ome by lu&s;ts and plea&s;ures, &s;ome by pa&s;&s;ions, and others by worldly intere&s;ts, are drawn away from the pow|er, to do and &s;ay that which the power is again&s;t: Is not this a for&s;aking of the Lord the living fountain? What do they do then? Are they not for this and that, and the other man? for hearing this and the other man's word, and <HI>digging to them&s;elves broken ci&s;terns?</HI> And have they not their tru&s;t and confidence in going to meetings, in commending this and the other way?

this? If you had all the men and angels that were ever &s;ent of God, appointed to preach to you, they could not mini&s;ter life to you, unle&s;s there be that faith that &s;tands in the power of God. The faith that &s;tands in any man's words, will not overcome your lu&s;ts; but the faith that &s;tands in the power of God, <HI>purifies the heart;</HI> it will not &s;uffer any unclean thing there. As for preaching, let a man preach again&s;t this and the other lu&s;t and corrup|tion, there it will remain for all his preaching, unle&s;s men know God's power and life, in which there is righteou&s;|ne&s;s; for words and knowledge, and &s;ight and &s;peculati|on, will never give people victory over their &s;ins.</P>
<P>Therefore you know, every one who is &s;ettled mu&s;t be &s;ettled where the foundation of religion is; it is not com|ing to meetings, and owning this and the other doctrine which is the foundation of our religion; God hath re|vealed his power to every one of us; God hath not giv|en his Spirit to preachers and prophets only, for then there would be a <HI>famine of the word,</HI> as was in <HI>I&s;rael, the prie&s;t's lips only pre&s;erved knowledge.</HI> If you did take away the prie&s;t, you did take away their knowledge. The prophets had the word of God, and they only &s;pake the word of God. If the prophet was taken away, then the word of God was taken away. The Lord threatened to &s;end a famine among them; they grieved and vexed, and killed and de&s;troyed, the prie&s;ts and prophets; therefore, &s;aith the Lord, <HI>I will &s;end a famine among you, not of bread, but of the word; and they &s;hall go from city to city, and enquire for the word of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it was in the Jewi&s;h church; if there was a pro|phet they would go thirty, forty, or a hundred miles to him that had the word of the Lord; <HI>they &s;hall go from city to city, to enquire for the word of the Lord:</HI> But ble&s;&s;ed be God we are come to another day, for now the word of the Lord is manife&s;ted in the hearts of all that believe; they know the word: I do not &s;ay all that believe do preach the word, or ought to preach; but the word preacheth to them; they are not as <HI>broken ci&s;ternt that can hold no water;</HI> when they find the word and hear it, they &s;peak it pre&s;ently; what is mini&s;tered to

their own condition, that they tell to other folks; when people come to the ble&s;&s;ing of this di&s;pen&s;ation that God's word revealeth in their hearts, they then know what the &s;ignification of it is, they under&s;tand the doctrine of it, the doctrine preacheth holine&s;s to them; not that they &s;hould preach holine&s;s and yet remain unholy; not that they &s;hould preach humility, and yet remain proud: it preacheth holine&s;s, humility and &s;inglene&s;s of heart to a remnant, that like good &s;cholars and di&s;ciples learn the le&s;&s;ons and doctrine of the word of God.</P>
<P>Now when thou ha&s;t learned them well, and art come to &s;ee the effect of the word, and do&s;t bring forth the deeds and works which are the fruits of holine&s;s, <HI>perfecting holine&s;s in the fear of God, and with humility known and witne&s;&s;ed in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> and art not only meek in &s;how, but <HI>meek and low in heart;</HI> when people come to be meek and lowly, and of a clear con&s;cience, <HI>purged from all dead works to &s;erve the living God;</HI> then if the Lord gives them a word of exhortation, of doctrine or coun&s;el, it is very welcome, and it hath a &s;avour through the ble&s;&s;ing of God, and they come by it to be <HI>built up in their mo&s;t holy faith,</HI> and this word is brought forth in holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s in their lives, and &s;hews it&s;elf in a life of holine&s;s; then thou wilt &s;hine in thy conver&s;ation to all that thou conver&s;e&s;t with, &s;o that they may &s;ee thee to be &s;uch a man or woman as ha&s;t been with Je&s;us, and learned of Je&s;us, and received <HI>a word engrafted;</HI> when thou do&s;t receive the word into thy heart, there is the engrafting of it: If it hath not root there, then, &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>my word doth not abide in you.</HI> If you feel &s;omething of this invi&s;ible word in your hearts, it brings you to a re&s;olution to &s;erve God, and to keep your&s;elves from &s;in, and to an&s;wer the profe&s;&s;ion which you make of God; this is the effect of the word of God, if it doth abide in you. Doth it abide? You &s;hall know anon or to morrow, &s;o &s;oon as a temptation comes to &s;tir you up to pride or pa&s;&s;ion, to fraud or deceit, then you will &s;ee whether the word abide: If it abide, you &s;in not.</P>
<P>This is &s;cripture, a certain fundamental doctrine, that may be as &s;afely preached as any doctrine: If the word abide

in you, you &s;in not; what of that? let the word go, and you will &s;in, when ever you are tempted to it. <HI>I write to you young men, becau&s;e you have overcome the wicked one, you are &s;trong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.</HI> We &s;hall &s;ee as &s;oon as a temptation meets with thee, whether the word abides in thee; if it abide, thou wilt not &s;in, but re&s;i&s;t the tempter. Set thy foot upon the temptation, and go over it, and thou wilt have the dominion; and this will make thee a free man or woman, and thou wilt <HI>&s;tand fa&s;t in the liberty wherewith Chri&s;t hath made thee free.</HI> The apo&s;tle &s;uppo&s;eth them free, and that they have got dominion; then <HI>&s;tand fa&s;t,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>in the liberty where|with Chri&s;t hath made thee free.</HI> It is a liberty not of lu&s;t and &s;in, but a liberty of the &s;oul; the &s;oul now is not at the devil's will and call.</P>
<P>For it is a &s;hame to the doctrine of Chri&s;tianity, that we profe&s;s things, and yet deny them in practice: We profe&s;s that there is a power in Chri&s;t to keep and pre&s;erve us out of &s;in, and we profe&s;s to believe this power is com|municated to them that do believe in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t for their pre&s;ervation; that is, he will not withhold it from them: We profe&s;s the&s;e things in the face of the whole world; and yet when the devil calls one man to covetou&s;|ne&s;s, and another to defraud his neighbour, and another to defile him&s;elf, he is drawn away thereby; what hypocri&s;y is here to profe&s;s this, and act the contrary? I do not wonder that they that profe&s;s they cannot live a day without &s;in, that they &s;hould fall; but they that profe&s;s to believe there is power enough in Chri&s;t, and that it is offered to them, to live in &s;in and yield to temptation, this is horrid wickedne&s;s. They that are of an upright, &s;ingle mind, would die before they would &s;in, knowing that God is Al|mighty, and gracious, and willing to be&s;tow his power, and wi&s;dom, and grace, upon them that ask it; they would die rather than &s;in again&s;t God pre&s;umptuou&s;ly: let it co&s;t me my goods, my e&s;tate, my liberty, or my life, <HI>how can I do this great wickedne&s;s, and &s;in again&s;t God?</HI> They love God above all; you never heard them complain that they wanted power, <HI>for the Lord is at their right hand, and they

<P>Oh! it is a noble and honourable thing to be a child of God, a very high dignity to be in &s;uch an honourable re|lation to God, and to have a right to the heavenly man&s;ions, <HI>to &s;it down in heavenly places in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> I would to God you were all ready for it, that you had the wedding garment on, that you might not be <HI>bound hand and foot, and ca&s;t into utter darkne&s;s.</HI> What is the rea&s;on that you do not &s;it down in this heavenly frame and temper, and draw the waters of &s;alvation out of your own &s;ouls; could the Lord do any thing more than he hath done, and could his &s;ervants do any more than they have done for your help? Are not their labours demon&s;trations of it? We have been <HI>as epi&s;tles of Chri&s;t written in your con&s;ciences.</HI> We have been te&s;tifying that there is &s;omething wanting in too ma|ny, the want of re&s;igning up them&s;elves to the bapti&s;m of the cro&s;s. People are willing to be counted friends; but they are friends of God, <HI>that do what&s;oever he commandeth them;</HI> that is the Chri&s;tian le&s;&s;on, not to &s;ay, I will be a friend to you, and a friend to the church, and to &s;uch a &s;ort of people; but I will be a friend of God, and do what|&s;oever he commandeth me; what&s;oever command God lays upon you, either to take up a cro&s;s, or to deny your&s;elves and follow him.</P>
<P>Learn this le&s;&s;on, and you will be di&s;ciples indeed, and members of the church too; not members of a church privi|leged outwardly only, but <HI>members of a church of the fir&s;t born, and you will have your names written in Heaven;</HI> when one comes to have his name written in Heaven, he comes to know his name, it is a <HI>white Stone,</HI> not a &s;peckled one; they that have it, they know it, they are not ignorant of one another's names, that are written in this book; they have a fellow&s;hip that nobody can declare; their commu|nion is in that bread and that cup: This is a cup of ble&s;|&s;ing

<P>We talk of a bulwark as well as others; we have a bulwark, ble&s;&s;ed be the God of Heaven, made of better &s;tuff than theirs; for it is the &s;alvation of God which hath kept us from the pollution of &s;in, and from a running <HI>into all exce&s;s and riot</HI> that others have run into; it hath kept us from the evil, it hath kept evils out of us, and we have found that certainly true, that <HI>all things work together for good, to them that love God, and fear God;</HI> that all the providences of God together, have all wrought for our good; and this is the bulwark that we have tru&s;ted in, and it hath &s;erved hitherto, and it will &s;erve us and our po&s;terity to the end of the world: This is a bulwark that will never be &s;tormed, that will never be thrown down nor laid wa&s;te: Though all the powers on earth, and all the potentates in this world &s;hould agree together, they &s;hall not prevail again&s;t it; we have <HI>&s;alvation for walls and bulwarks;</HI> if I be within the&s;e walls, &s;alvation is round about me; if I am got into this eternal bulwark, I am &s;afe from the devil and his in&s;truments; here is a bulwark to be re|lied upon.</P>
<P>Many wonder we differ with them in &s;ome opinions; we have that confidence in this bulwark, that we de&s;ire not another; God will la&s;t and abide forever, &s;o will this bulwark; all the care that I take, and all the care that you &s;hould take, is to keep within the&s;e walls: Do not &s;ally out, if you go out, the devil is watching, and <HI>&s;eeking continually whom he may devour;</HI> he will catch &s;traglers; if people will go out for profit, or for plea&s;ure, or in|tere&s;t,

the devil will catch them; how can &s;uch people talk of &s;alvation for walls and bulwarks? the devil hath got them in his &s;nare, and they are caught in drunkenne&s;s, un|cleanne&s;s and other &s;ins; the rea&s;on is, they have gone out of their bulwark, they have &s;allied out of their walls, for the devil could never have forced them out.</P>
<P><HI>O take heed,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <HI>le&s;t there &s;pring up in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God;</HI> as if he had &s;aid, you are Chri&s;tians now, you are a people come to a good &s;tate in Chri&s;t; but con&s;ider you have no &s;trength to &s;tand but in him; no power to keep your&s;elves but in him; <HI>take heed,</HI> at all times, <HI>that there &s;pring not up in you an evil heart of un|belief, in departing from the living God;</HI> take heed le&s;t there &s;pring up in you &s;uch a thought as this; I may take this plea&s;ure, and the other profit; con&s;ider that thou die&s;t and withere&s;t if thou depart from the living God; take heed of taking liberty above the fear of God: It is not our talk of &s;alvation for walls and bulwarks, that will do us good, but our keeping within the&s;e walls.</P>
<P>I remember a notable &s;aying of the apo&s;tle, which hath a great empha&s;is in it, and a great deal of doctrine; he writeth to the church, after they were become a people of profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians, <HI>take heed le&s;t you come to be be|guiled by the &s;erpent, as he beguiled Eve;</HI> he did not &s;peak of <HI>Jezabel,</HI> a wicked woman; but he &s;poke of <HI>Eve,</HI> a good woman, <HI>created after the image of God, in righ|teou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s;</HI> they were come to a life of &s;anc|tification, to a life <HI>that was hidden from ages and gene|rations.</HI> You mu&s;t look to your&s;elves, and look upon your|&s;elves as in the &s;tate of your mother <HI>Eve,</HI> a woman brought forth in righteou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s, that might have &s;tood in that primitive &s;tate, notwith&s;tanding all the &s;ubtilty of all the &s;erpents in the world; but having hearkened to this old &s;erpent, &s;he was beguiled; there grew up a con&s;ultation in her rea&s;oning part; it may be &s;o as he &s;aith, I will try.</P>
<P>So I &s;ay to you that are come to a &s;tate of &s;anctifica|tion, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure to know the clean&s;ing power of God, that you have not believed in it in vain, but
<PB N="249" REF="020309_0249_0FAEF8E4D75626D0">
it hath effectually wrought &s;ome change and alteration in you, and is &s;till carrying on the work of your &s;alvation. Many temptations will attend you, and many &s;nares will be laid in your way; but God hath pre&s;erved you to this day: I know the devil's wiles and temptations are manifold; they are fitted to every one's inclinations, fit|ted to every opportunity, and to every occa&s;ion in this world: Men are tried every way by the tempter, to &s;ee which way he may en&s;nare them; he tries every way to <HI>en&s;nare and entangle the &s;imple,</HI> that he may turn them to the right hand or to the left, that their &s;ouls may be de&s;troyed and peri&s;h.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;peak to you by a more emphatical word, by a more familiar exhortation than this, <HI>take heed you be not be|guiled as Eve was:</HI> Many will be tempted as &s;he was, but I would not have you do as &s;he did, and yield to the temp|tation: Take heed that you do not defile your&s;elves, but <HI>keep your garments white;</HI> you that have been wa&s;hed and clean&s;ed, labour to <HI>keep your&s;elves un&s;potted from the world; this is pure religion and undefiled,</HI> that which hath enlight|ened many a nation, and &s;hall enlighten many of tho&s;e who&s;e religion is to be undefiled, and to <HI>keep them&s;elves un&s;potted from the world.</HI> I pray God encrea&s;e the number of them, that &s;o the ble&s;&s;ed work of &s;anctification that hath begun in this way, may be carried on to his prai&s;e, and the &s;alva|tion of our &s;ouls, to the &s;preading forth of his glory, and the exalting of his name; that the &s;trangers which are &s;cat|tered and de&s;olate, may be brought into his holy way, and walk in it; that we all, in a fellow&s;hip together, walking in that holy way, may through the eternal Spirit, offer prai&s;e and thank&s;giving to God, who is worthy to receive glory and honour, power and dominion, forever and ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

If they be none of Chri&s;t's that have not his Spirit, who&s;e are they? They are all his who&s;e Spirit rules them, every one of us doth belong to him who&s;e Spirit ruleth over us, unto who&s;e power we are &s;ubjected. You know this di&s;tingui&s;heth people in the world, one king knoweth his &s;ubjects from another king's &s;ubjects; they are under the obedience of this, that, and the other king or prince, his law is over them, they are &s;ubject to it; &s;o here is a deci&s;ion of all the people in the world, whom they belong to.</P>
<P>We, all of us, I hope, do expect there will be a de|ci&s;ion at the day of judgment, and believe the things we read concerning it, that there will be a deci&s;ion, and &s;ome will be placed on the right hand, and &s;ome on the left; &s;ome will have the &s;entence of, <HI>come ye ble&s;&s;ed,</HI> and others the &s;entence of, <HI>go ye cur&s;ed;</HI> but now there is a way of finding out the deci&s;ion of the matter before we go out of the world, before the day of judgment, when there will be no remedy, what then is, mu&s;t be and abide &s;o; now there is no need it &s;hould continue &s;o; if it be ami&s;s, it may be mended; if I do not belong to the right prince, if I be not under the right power and &s;pirit, I may be, for now it is a day of grace, a day of mercy; I have been a rebel to the right prince, I may be par|doned and taken into favour; it is far better for people

<P>The apo&s;tle, in laying down fundamental, apo&s;tolical doctrines, that were to be believed and taken notice of, and are in our age, &s;o that we may &s;ay, <HI>things written of old time, were written for our learning;</HI> he makes this affirmation and po&s;ition of doctrine, <HI>he that hath not the Spirit of Chri&s;t, is none of his,</HI> he doth not belong to him; tho' he be called a Chri&s;tian, he is not a Chri&s;tian, if he hath not the Spirit of Chri&s;t; it is but a name he hath got, he hath not that which makes him e&s;&s;entially &s;o, for nothing can make a Chri&s;tian, but having the Spi|rit of Chri&s;t; therefore when they would vindicate their being Chri&s;tians, they prove it thus; <HI>for he</HI> (&s;peaking of God) <HI>hath &s;ent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, and we know the mind of Chri&s;t; we know him that is true,</HI> or we are in him that is true; the&s;e things, if they were right, if they were true, were evident demon&s;trations that they were a &s;ort of men who depended more upon the Spirit and &s;piritual teachings, and &s;piritual guidance, than upon all the rules and methods of teaching that were in the world.</P>
<P>I &s;peak of this, friends, becau&s;e you know as well as I, how aver&s;e this age of ours hath been, to have any thing &s;poken of &s;piritual di&s;pen&s;ations, or about &s;piritual teach|ings; though a man hath been counted formerly a wi&s;e man, a learned man, or a man of parts, if once he come to &s;matter out a little about inward teaching, it is enough to &s;pot him, and make him ridiculed of his acquaintance, as if there were no &s;uch thing in the world: We have a book, called the <HI>bible,</HI> it is from one end to the other full of &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions, of being led by the Spirit; <HI>you have an anointing which teacheth you all things:</HI> The whole tenor of the New Te&s;tament is about &s;piritual teachings and divine operations, and of <HI>faith</HI> being <HI>the operation of God;</HI> and the Old Te&s;tament hath abundance of expre&s;&s;ions by way of prophecy, that in the New Te&s;tament days, if people would look for the law of God, they mu&s;t look for it <HI>in their hearts;</HI> and if they would know God, they mu&s;t look to <HI>the Mediator, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> The
<PB N="252" REF="020309_0252_0FAEF8E74A09AFD8">
New Te&s;tament al&s;o directs us that way; Chri&s;tians &s;hould be the mo&s;t &s;piritual people in the world, that is the guide, the rule.</P>
<P>But, &s;ay they, the &s;cripture is the foundation of faith and manners, belief and practice; this is too often but di&s;&s;imulation, and I am afraid it is to be found in &s;ome; what, is the &s;cripture the rule of faith? and may people believe what they find in &s;cripture? Yes, but &s;ay &s;ome, it is be&s;t be aware for fear of error. What is in the &s;cripture is &s;erious, &s;ound and ortho|dox, and did Quakers, think you, never find in &s;cripture that people were to <HI>wait for the Spirit,</HI> and <HI>pray in the Spirit,</HI> and <HI>&s;erve God in the Spirit,</HI> and that all religion that is not in power, is not available, did they not find it in &s;crip|ture? And you that are not Quakers, did you ever read the New Te&s;tament? How came it to pa&s;s that ye never found the&s;e texts? But &s;ome people read and read the New Te&s;|tament twenty times over, and mock and deride, and per&s;e|cute a man that &s;hall &s;peak of the Spirit's teaching.</P>
<P>I have admired at it, how intelligent men, to whom God hath given a competent under&s;tanding, &s;hould be &s;o blinded; they have learned to read Engli&s;h, and they have read the New Te&s;tament over &s;everal times, and the Old Te&s;tament too, and they have read tho&s;e &s;entences of Chri&s;t's doctrine, that do &s;o currently and unanimou&s;ly &s;peak of divine teach|ings and &s;piritual operations, &s;piritual wor&s;hip and &s;piritual religion, that mu&s;t have &s;ome motion and &s;tirring of the Holy Gho&s;t to be the original of it, and that all others are not ac|ceptable to God; doubtle&s;s they have read the&s;e things, but I have often de&s;ired and do &s;till de&s;ire that they would read it again once more, and try and &s;ee what God will do; he hath oftentimes made u&s;e of the holy &s;cripture as a means to awaken people and to open their under&s;tandings, and let them &s;ee the mind of the &s;pirit by which the &s;cripture is written, and the next time if they can find &s;cripture text and apo&s;tolical doctrine, to teach people to wait upon the Spirit, I hope they will leave &s;coffing and mocking.</P>
<P>It hath been hitherto looked upon as an invention, to &s;peak of the <HI>teaching of the Spirit,</HI> and <HI>waiting upon the Spirit,</HI> and being moved by the Spirit. This apo&s;tolical doctrine, prayer and wor&s;hip, hath been looked upon as an invention
<PB N="253" REF="020309_0253_0FAEF8E996029CF0">
that we have brought in: To look for the Holy Gho&s;t in that way that was never known to our fathers, is a fanta&s;tical conceit of the Quakers, &s;ay they: To tell people they mu&s;t be led by the Spirit in divine things, as in prayer and wor|&s;hip, and the like, that in the&s;e things they mu&s;t wait for the Spirit, was there ever any man that was counted good for any thing that ever preached &s;o, before they came? Do we read any &s;uch kind of thing in &s;cripture?</P>
<P>O! the blindne&s;s that hath happened to this nation! I have con&s;idered, not without admiration, how the devil (he is a Spirit too, and a wicked one) how he &s;hould have pow|er to prevent our acknowledging the belief, &s;en&s;e and feeling of the Spirit of God now-a-days; there are thou&s;ands in this nation that have formerly believed that it was as impo&s;&s;ible for a man to believe the divine motions and &s;trugglings of the Spirit of God in this life, as to rai&s;e their fathers and mothers out of their graves; &s;ome of their learned teachers have told us it is a whim&s;y and fancy, and that there was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">o in&s;piration of the Spirit now-a-days, but that it was a fooli&s;h fancy in us to wait for &s;uch a thing, it is needle&s;s, &s;ay they; there was an immediate teaching in the apo&s;tles days, and they had the &s;en&s;e of the Spirit of Chri&s;t working in them, to teach them to write letters and epi&s;tles to the church, which letters and epi&s;tles were written by the moving of the Holy Gho&s;t, but we have no need of it now, the Holy Gho&s;t hath brought order and government into the church, we have it now in black and white printed in our books, therefore &s;ay they, there is no need of the Spirit, and peo|ple need not be acquainted with the operation of the Spirit now-a-days, in regard they have it in their books what man|ner of wor&s;hip they mu&s;t perform.</P>
<P>I grant them their due, that they have the direction of the &s;cripture; I am able to under&s;tand that people are to wor|&s;hip God, and pray to him, and are to meet together and to ob&s;erve this and the other doctrinal precepts there laid down; I confe&s;s I can make &s;hift herewith to frame out a form of religion, and if I do not mi&s;take in the opening and expli|cation of the doctrine, I could make a right form too, but I am liable to mi&s;take, another man that under&s;tands Greek better than I, &s;aith that the Greek word ought to be tran&s;lat|ed
<PB N="254" REF="020309_0254_0FAEF8EA10E77808">
&s;o, and the form ought to differ in &s;uch a re&s;pect; &s;ome &s;ay the only way of government is by bi&s;hops, and the word bears it in the original, and another &s;aith he hath &s;tretched the word, for the word means pre&s;byter; another &s;aith pre&s;byter &s;ignifies no more than choice of church elders and deacons, and &s;uch like, and this is all out of one book, the &s;ettlement of bi&s;hops, pre&s;byters, and elders.</P>
<P>Here a number of form-makers all fall out about the mean|ing of the word; what remedy can any mortal man provide for this? We mu&s;t not be killing and &s;laying one another about words; if I be an epi&s;copal man and &s;ay the word &s;ignifies bi&s;hops, I may be a wicked man &s;till; and if another &s;ay it mu&s;t be pre&s;byter, he may be a wicked man too, and if another &s;ay it &s;hould be pa&s;tor, elders, and deacons, he may be a wicked man notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Thus they have rent and torn one another about church government; what remedy &s;hall we have for this, that the&s;e quarrellings and contentions about terms and words may come to an end? Could a man pre&s;cribe a more certain remedy for all the&s;e mi&s;takes than this, if they had a mea&s;ure of this Spirit which did work in the apo&s;tles when they wrote down the&s;e words, which the apo&s;tles had in writing them, then I &s;ay they could tell you what the Spirit meant, for the Spirit is the &s;ame and not changed, and the words are the &s;ame to a &s;mall matter, &s;o that if a man had that, he might end all the controver&s;y; but where &s;hall we have a man that hath this Spirit to end the controver&s;y? There is none now-a-days &s;ay the Prote&s;tants, and &s;ay the Papi&s;ts there is none but one that hath this infallibility; and many will not &s;uppo&s;e that neither, for &s;ome of them &s;ay, that one man is as infallible as another man; there is a great di&s;pute whether any one man be infallible, or a great many men to|gether are infallible about doctrine and wor&s;hip: This might be cured all at once if we could come to this conclu&s;ion. Papi&s;ts, Prote&s;tants and Quakers, here is an end of all out-&s;ide wor&s;hip, <HI>he that hath not the Spirit of Chri&s;t is none of his:</HI> If there be not Spirit in it, it is not Chri&s;t's religion and wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>So that they that jangle and bark and bite, are without, among <HI>dogs and &s;orcerers,</HI> that are &s;trangers to the Spirit of

Chri&s;t; there is a &s;pirit in them that denies the Spirit of Chri&s;t, there is a Spirit that rules in them that are without the Spirit, for nobody that I know of, acts things without a &s;pirit, and without being moved. What, are good and bad all moved by the Spirit, and yet are there no motions? I have &s;ometimes turned the que&s;tion upon people, and asked them if there were no motions of the evil &s;pirit, hath it no &s;uch kind of influence that it can move upon our &s;pirits, that we can &s;en&s;ibly feel our&s;elves thru&s;t forth to &s;uch an action? I never met any man that would deny it, they are &s;o generally favourable to the wicked &s;pirit; no man will deny but the devil hath a way of moving and &s;tirring upon the &s;pirit of a man, and to &s;ugge&s;t to him &s;uch an evil thing, and as I have &s;ometimes &s;aid, it is &s;o received an opinion, that when the malefactor comes to be arraigned at the bar for &s;ome grievous crime, they lay the foundation of the indict|ment, &s;uch a day he was moved and in&s;tigated by the devil to do &s;uch a thing; here is a &s;ettled motion for the devil, for him to influence peoples &s;pirits, but no way for the good Spirit of God to influence mens &s;pirits; here is nothing left us but a bad in&s;tigation; but to know inward motions to good things, it is not to be expected now-a-days.</P>
<P>How &s;hould ever the cunning &s;erpent, that would have power over the be&s;t of us all, be &s;aid to winnow us? Chri&s;t &s;ignified to <HI>Peter,</HI> a bold and re&s;olute di&s;ciple, <HI>&s;a|tan de&s;ires to have thee, and winnow thee as wheat;</HI> if the devil had power over every one, to make them his &s;er|vants and &s;laves, what remedy have we but we mu&s;t all peri&s;h and go headlong to hell with him, unle&s;s there be &s;ome way of re&s;i&s;ting him? That is true, &s;ay people, the devil mu&s;t be re&s;i&s;ted; we find it in the New Te&s;tament, <HI>re&s;i&s;t the devil;</HI> this is a good exerci&s;e; but tell me one thing, when I go about to re&s;i&s;t the devil, mu&s;t I re&s;i&s;t him in my own power? If I was to &s;ay you might do &s;o, you would &s;ay I was an erroneous preacher, and well you might: This is an old free-will doctrine, that a man may re&s;i&s;t the devil by his own power, and e&s;cape his &s;nares, and do the will of God: This hath been cried down by the doctors of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and by mo&s;t of all &s;orts of Chri&s;tians; and for our parts, &s;ince the

Lord hath opened our mouths, we did never &s;peak a word in favour of it, as if we went about to re&s;i&s;t the devil in our own &s;trength; if we did, the devil would make fools of us: He that goes about to re&s;i&s;t the devil in his own &s;trength, will be entrapped and en&s;nared by him, in that men have a propen&s;ity to &s;in, and by his cunning and &s;ubtilty, may be led into a &s;nare before they are aware.</P>
<P>Thus it is agreed on all hands, that our power, as men, is too weak to re&s;i&s;t &s;atan's temptation, &s;o that you &s;ee we mu&s;t have the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the divine power, or all go to hell; there is no medium between tho&s;e two extremes, &s;ome extraordinary power mu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t me, or el&s;e the devil will have me. If you will not admit of a &s;upernatural power to come in to help me and you, we mu&s;t all go to hell, there is no remedy: I will &s;ay my prayers, &s;aith one; do &s;o, yet in the be&s;t of your prayers there will be &s;in; and <HI>if I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:</HI> I will go and hear &s;ermons, &s;ay you; the very man that preacheth will tell you, that hearing of &s;ermons will do you no good at all, unle&s;s there be mo|tions of the Spirit of God, &s;o that you will be wrapt from one thing to another, and have diver&s;ity of doctrines, and come to no fixedne&s;s; and while you concern your&s;elves about doctrines, all the while the devil prevails upon you; as for the tongue, he hath the rule of that, and as for the hands, he hath the rule of them, and makes you do tho&s;e things that by his perpetual &s;ugge&s;tions he moves you to; &s;o that your going to church and &s;aying your prayers &s;ignify nothing to bring you from under the wrath of God, and from the captivity of the devil: Hath not the devil tho&s;e in captivity that go to church, and &s;ay their prayers, and give alms? The&s;e are things that you can do by your own power, the &s;aying of your prayers, and fa&s;ting, and giving of alms, the&s;e things thou maye&s;t do, the devil will not hinder thee, for he knows that the&s;e will not bring thee out of his clutches, nor out of his chains and fetters.</P>
<P>There is but one way and means by which the devil may be effectually re&s;i&s;ted, that is by taking to our help <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;tronger than he; I have gone for help to many &s;tronger than I, in my young days, that I thought to be &s;tronger

<P>For me to fall into the hands of a tyrant that is &s;tronger than I, and no man to deliver me, how &s;ad would it be.

<P>The devil hath brought men to this pa&s;s, that they live as ea&s;ily in a &s;inful life, as a fi&s;h in the &s;tream: We are in the way, &s;ay they; when we were baptized, we were initi|ated into the Chri&s;tian church, we were baptized with the &s;ign of the cro&s;s, that &s;hews we are &s;oldiers of Chri&s;t and bear his badge and banner upon us; and the man &s;aid at that time, I was made a child of God and an inheritor of the kingdom of Heaven; if this be not true, then I am cheated and deceived, for I am to believe this to be true; the church hath affirmed that the&s;e things are to be be|lieved; and to que&s;tion the veracity of the church, is to que&s;tion all.</P>
<P>I would que&s;tion whether thou&s;ands find the truth of it. When thou wert baptized, there was a kind of co|venant and bargain made for this child of God and heir of eternal life, that he &s;hould for&s;ake the devil and all his works, and the pomps and vanities of this wicked world, and the &s;inful lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h: And there is &s;e|curity given that this child &s;hall never &s;erve the devil and &s;inful lu&s;ts, and never be proud, but &s;erve God and keep his commandments: Now this &s;ecurity being taken, then they &s;uppo&s;e that this child will certainly be an heir of the kingdom of God. It is very true, &s;tand to thy church; if this &s;ecurity that is taken for a child be but effectual, then there is no doubt of being a child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of Heaven. But if this &s;ecurity fail, is the church to blame if men's hopes to eternal life fail? Was it not my condition, that thou &s;houlde&s;t

Never talk of being a child and an heir of God's kingdom, &s;uch a man is in fetters, he is to go along with the devil and his angels, and there is a king|dom prepared for them, and a kingdom of darkne&s;s, and he mu&s;t have his portion with them in everla&s;ting mi&s;ery: <HI>Tophet is prepared of old for all the workers of iniquity.</HI></P>

<P>This bapti&s;m had never an apo&s;tolical patron, but there is another bapti&s;m that is &s;o infallible a bapti&s;m, that if a man were &s;urely baptized withal, he was &s;ure of Heaven, he would never need any other a&s;&s;urance of Heaven than to be bap|tized with the bapti&s;m of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: The lip of truth &s;peaks of him, <HI>he that believeth and is baptized, &s;hall be &s;aved:</HI> He &s;hall be &s;aved in &s;pite of the devil and all his temptations, in &s;pite of per&s;ecutions and the &s;tumbling-blocks laid before him. Here is a bapti&s;m worth a man's while, worth all his labour, if he could obtain it; <HI>he that cometh after me,</HI> &s;aith <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t, <HI>he &s;hall baptize you with the Holy Gho&s;t and with fire;</HI> here is a bapti&s;m belongs to Chri&s;tians, an ordi|nance ordained. Far be it from us to deny bapti&s;m; but we would light of the right, &s;ince there are &s;o many &s;orts: This bapti&s;m is &s;o right and certain, that it a&s;certains a man of his &s;alvation, but it is done by <HI>the Holy Gho&s;t and with fire:</HI> If it be by the Holy Gho&s;t, then it is far enough off from us; for there is no Holy Gho&s;t in our days, &s;ay &s;ome, &s;o this bapti&s;m is cea&s;ed, and in&s;piration is cea&s;ed. If the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> and <HI>fire</HI> be the matter of bapti&s;m, the thing being failed and cea&s;ed, the con&s;equence cannot follow; thou and I cannot be baptized becau&s;e there is no working of the Holy Gho&s;t in our days; &s;ay &s;ome, this bapti&s;m is <HI>with the Holy Gho&s;t and with fire;</HI> with fire for burning up our corruptions, and purifying our hearts. But the Holy Gho&s;t hath done working upon men, &s;ay they; why then there is an end of bapti&s;m: A man is hungry, and when his time comes to eat, he hath no victuals, yet he &s;its him down as if he did eat; will this feed and nouri&s;h him? So men now-a-days, they have a bapti&s;m wherewith they are baptized; but bapti&s;m with <HI>the Holy Gho&s;t and with fire,</HI> is the right bap|ti&s;m, therefore do not baptize until you find the Holy Gho&s;t, this will be far better; this is the bapti&s;m that they which come to know it, are &s;ure of &s;alvation by it; for by this bapti&s;m, they are borne up and tinctured in their &s;ouls with the Divine Spirit of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, proceeding from the Father and the Son, till they receive his likene&s;s, and &s;o die unto

&s;in: <HI>As many as were baptized, were baptized into Chri&s;t's death.</HI> The apo&s;tle openeth it, <HI>in that he died he died unto &s;in once, but in that he liveth he liveth unto God; &s;o that they that were baptized, were baptized into Chri&s;t's death; and you that are dead unto &s;in, how &s;hould you live any longer therein?</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e that were baptized lived without &s;in; can that be true, that no one lived without &s;in but Chri&s;t only? Yes, &s;aith the apo&s;tle, <HI>you that were free from &s;in, are alive to righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> their life &s;tood before in &s;in, and now that life is taken away by bapti&s;m, and they are alive to Chri&s;t, and he that liveth he liveth to God. He that comes to be partaker of the fir&s;t re&s;urrection, if he live ten, twenty, forty, or a hundred years, he liveth to God, he liveth no more in the pomps and vanities of the world, and the &s;inful lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h, but <HI>he liveth unto God.</HI> This bap|ti&s;m, whoever comes to be baptized with it, &s;hall be &s;av|ed; &s;o that we do not deny bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>But we hear &s;ay, that you deny the Lord's &s;upper. We have never had &s;uch a thought, God knows; there is nothing that our &s;ouls long after more; but people have been making a kind of work of their own, they have lo&s;t a reality, and make &s;hadows, as children do, who when they &s;ee things made in the hou&s;e for &s;ervice, they will make the like in &s;and and clay. People do not not &s;ee what a great thing it is to attain to the &s;upper of the Lord; as things come into an evangelical opening, we &s;pake then more lively and fre&s;hly of things. <HI>Behold I &s;tand at the door and knock, if any man open to me, I will come in and &s;up with him, and he with me.</HI> For the under&s;tanding of this text, go and examine, and &s;earch all the commentators you can find, and &s;ee what the learn|ed men &s;ay of it; &s;ee if they do not apply this to the inward call of the Spirit and grace of Chri&s;t, to let him into our hearts; and would one think that tho&s;e that wrote the&s;e things &s;hould be again&s;t the &s;piritual di&s;pen&s;ation of things? They &s;ay that this knocking at the door of the heart &s;ignifies the call of God's Spirit at the door of the heart. There are two &s;orts of &s;inners that God knock|eth at the door of their hearts; one is, a man that is
<PB N="262" REF="020309_0262_0FAEF8F49251BE38">
weary of his &s;in: For his part, he wi&s;heth that he might never &s;in more. As &s;oon as he perceives the knock, and is called upon to let in the grace of God, to help him again&s;t temptation, he freely opens his heart to receive it, and &s;aith, with all my heart I will entertain and welcome the grace of God; glad I am that God hath had &s;o much patience towards me; and &s;ince God offers his grace, I will embrace this grace of God above all plea&s;ures, and I will take it into my heart; the grace of Chri&s;t is the greate&s;t jewel that I know. Hone&s;t <HI>Paul,</HI> he took this cour&s;e, and prayed, Lord take away this tempter; here is a temptation that troubleth me, and I am not willing to yield, for all the devil follows me with it; <HI>he cried unto the Lord, and be&s;ought him three times, earne&s;tly,</HI> to take away the temptation; and the Lord an&s;wers him, <HI>my grace is &s;ufficient for thee.</HI> What matter if the tempter buffet thee, and trouble thee, ha&s;t thou not received my grace into thy heart? Thou art a believer, and thy tru&s;t is in me, and <HI>my grace is &s;ufficient for thee.</HI> Let the tempter do his wor&s;t, keep thou to the grace of God, and thou wilt with&s;tand and overcome the temptation when it comes.</P>
<P>If a man openeth his heart and receiveth Chri&s;t when he comes, then you &s;hall find &s;uch an alteration in that man, that go and try him with the &s;ame temptation which prevailed over him the la&s;t week, it will not do &s;o now; though he be as weak as water, and as prone to corruption and iniquity as before, yet now having a faith begotten in him, that the grace of God will defend him, he keeps out of the devil's &s;nares. Now this man tru&s;ting in this grace till his &s;in and iniquity be purged out, now is the time to spread the table; there is a clean heart, and the heavenly gue&s;t is now come, and the dainties of the kingdom are brought to him for his nouri&s;hment. <HI>Now,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>I will come in and &s;up with him, and my Father a &s;o will come, and we will &s;up with him, and he with us.</HI> This never happens to any body &s;o long as the table and heart is &s;oul; for the ta|ble mu&s;t be clean, and the devil and &s;in thrown out, and then will the Lord confirm and ratify, and &s;eal the co|venant; &s;o that here is a &s;eal with a witne&s;s. When a man hath this te&s;timony of the love of God, that God is
<PB N="263" REF="020309_0263_0FAEF8F6CC56A930">
reconciled to him in Chri&s;t, then Chri&s;t will come in, and he will bring his Father, and they will &s;up with him; and this is that which will give complete &s;atisfaction to &s;uch a &s;oul.</P>
<P>All the tongues of men and angels are too &s;hort to &s;peak of the&s;e things, as they are in them&s;elves, but they are all manife&s;ted by the Spirit. All the my&s;teries of the kingdom of God, are manife&s;ted by the Spirit of God; now to &s;ay there is no Spirit to be regarded now-a-days, that is as much as to &s;ay, we mu&s;t never regard the kingdom of God, <HI>for no man can di&s;cern the things of God but the Spirit of God,</HI> no man can tell what they be; <HI>as no man can know the things of a man but the &s;pirit of a man.</HI></P>
<P>But I mu&s;t look to this and the other form, and mark, and methodize them, for we can know nothing of the things of God them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I hope you are all of another judgment, and believe that this is a trick and cheat of the wicked one; people do find the Spirit and will feel it if they will wait upon the motions of it. I do not only mean when you are here together, but when you are &s;eparated one from ano|ther; when you feel the motions of this good Spirit, em|brace them, and make them yours. This Spirit is a gift that is given; &s;o may a &s;hilling or a piece of bread be held forth to a poor creature, but if he receive it not, he may peri&s;h for all that; it is not his, tho' I have ap|pointed it to be his, and have &s;eperated it from my other &s;ub&s;tance to be his. If he receive not what I offer and would give him, he may peri&s;h for all that.</P>
<P>Here is <HI>grace and truth comes by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and God hath offered it to all men, in that he hath rai&s;ed up Chri&s;t from the dead; the grace of God which bringeth &s;alvation, hath appeared unto all men;</HI> but all men have not received it, therefore all men have it not; and they that have not the grace of Chri&s;t, and the <HI>Spirit of Chri&s;t, are none of his;</HI> but it doth not follow that they never will be none of his. When they have received the gift by Chri&s;t, and &s;ay, I will be his &s;heep or lamb, they will come into his favour by that gift, and &s;hall partake of the good things of his Father's kingdom; but till they have received this
<PB N="264" REF="020309_0264_0FAEF8F6E7F76648">
gift, they are not the better for it, they have not any benefit by the death of Chri&s;t; they have no help, no benefit by it, except it be the patience and long-&s;uffering of God, who for Chri&s;t's &s;ake bears with their weakne&s;s, and waits to be gracious, and for Chri&s;t's &s;ake offers them favour; but they are not come to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, till they open their hearts, and receive the grace of Chri&s;t; then they are convinced of Chri&s;t's end, and that there is a po&s;&s;ibility of enjoying the Spirit of God, and of being taught and led by it.</P>
<P>Take this along with you, that it is your ab&s;olute and indi&s;pen&s;able duty to wait from day to day upon the great God of Heaven, <HI>the giver of every good and perfect gift,</HI> that you may have that ble&s;&s;ed gift, that you may have the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a greater power than your own to lead you out of &s;in into righteou&s;ne&s;s, that through Je&s;us Chir&s;t you may be acceptable to God.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Preached at GRACE-CHURCH-STREET, <DATE>April 18, 1687.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I Fear the high places are not taken away; it hath been &s;o in all ages, and it is manife&s;tly &s;o in this day; where the heart is not rightly prepared for the Lord, there the high places are not taken away: For all the high places in the time of <HI>I&s;rael</HI>'s idolatry, they were ever &s;et up when they departed from the Lord, and all the high places now they are up in a time of ignorance of God; when people have forgotten the Lord, then they ex|alt them&s;elves, then pride, and arrogance, and every evil way prevails upon us; but when men come to &s;eek the Lord with uprightne&s;s, that brings down their high con|ceits, that brings every one into humility; for every one comes to be convinced in them&s;elves that none can find
<PB N="265" REF="020309_0265_0FAEF8F7E663F8F0">
the Lord, but as they are brought to be humble; nay, indeed, none &s;eek after him aright but &s;uch, none have the promi&s;e of finding him but the humble.</P>
<P>Therefore it is the duty of every one that is a real en|quirer and &s;eeker after God, to know the right prepara|tion of mind, to know them&s;elves in &s;uch a frame of &s;pirit, that they may &s;eek in hope, that they may have a right and ju&s;t expectation of finding him whom they are &s;eeking after; for this hath been the rea&s;on that a great many have been fru&s;trated in their endeavours, and in their purpo&s;es of &s;eeking after the Lord, they have not been rightly prepared for him to manife&s;t him&s;elf unto them, they have not known the <HI>preparation of his &s;anc|tuary;</HI> there was a peculiar preparation that was requi&s;ite to tho&s;e that drew near unto the &s;anctuary of God, they were hallowed, that is, made holy, ere they drew near to the holy place; but alas! this hath been greatly neglected in our days, unholy people with unholy minds have been &s;eeking after the Holy God, they have been enquiring after a holy way, and were not prepared to walk in it, there was nothing rai&s;ed in their minds, that was fit to walk in that way.</P>
<P>For &s;o long as men or women &s;tand in unity with their lu&s;ts and concupi&s;cence, with the &s;pirit of this world, and the way of it, they are not capable of receiving that which &s;hould lead them into the way of holine&s;s; nay, if it appears to them, they cannot receive it, for it is with them as with other gue&s;ts, there be other lovers already let in, which employ the powers and faculties of their &s;ouls, &s;o that if the mo&s;t beloved of all, the mo&s;t excellent, if <HI>the chiefe&s;t of ten thou&s;and</HI> do appear, they cannot <HI>&s;ee a comeline&s;s in him.</HI> The prophet &s;peaking of this &s;tate and condition of men, did prophe&s;y concerning our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>when we &s;hall &s;ee him there is no comeline&s;s in him why we &s;hould de&s;ire him,</HI> and &s;o it hath happened to a great many now-a-days, though the truth hath appeared to them, yet they have not looked upon it as a plea&s;ant way, as a way de|&s;irable, but a way to be &s;hunned if po&s;&s;ible. What &s;hifts have a great many people made to keep them&s;elves, if po&s;&s;i|ble, out of the way of truth, arguing for this and that,
<PB N="266" REF="020309_0266_0FAEF8F850039430">
and di&s;puting for one way and another that was out of truth's way, out of the way of holine&s;s. What was the meaning of all their arguments, but to tell us they might be happy, they might be &s;aved, though they did not come into truth's way, and walk in truth's way? And though they did abide in tho&s;e things, that were contrary to the te&s;timony of truth in their own hearts, yet it might go well with them.</P>
<P>This is the &s;trength of the arguments of all &s;orts, of all per&s;ua&s;ions in the world, that have been arguing them&s;elves out of the truth, and would argue us out of the truth too, and would take the liberty to do tho&s;e things which are not agreeable therewith; but now the rea&s;on of this is becau&s;e the preparation is wanting, they are tho&s;e that have no need of truth, and that have no need of God, and of a Saviour; but think they can make &s;hift without them; he is not be|come the chiefe&s;t to them, they can abide in the high places, they can <HI>call upon the name of the</HI> Lord, and they can <HI>wor|&s;hip in the groves, and in the high places</HI> both together, like tho&s;e nations that were brought to inhabit the king|dom of I&s;rael when the ten tribes were carried away, they &s;ent for prie&s;ts to teach them, they &s;ent back to the king of <HI>A&s;&s;yria</HI> to &s;end them &s;ome prie&s;ts, to teach them to wor&s;hip the God of their country, and when the prie&s;t came to teach them, he taught them the ceremonies of the law, and the divers ob&s;ervations that the Jews u&s;ed to practi&s;e in that country, and &s;o they grew into a formality of &s;erving the God of <HI>I&s;rael, they called upon the name of the Lord, and every nation wor&s;hipped their own Gods.</HI></P>
<P>How is this nation, and the nations of Europe, now in|habited with &s;uch a people that are called by the name of the Lord, but every one wor&s;hipping their own Gods; one makes gold and &s;ilver his God, another makes his plea&s;ure his God, another his honour, another this, that, and the other lu&s;t, and they bow down to them, that is, they yield them|&s;elves to their lu&s;ts, concupi&s;cence and corruptions, that they &s;tand in unity with, but they call upon the name of the Lord too; they do apply them&s;elves to &s;ome kind of form of wor&s;hip, which they &s;ay is unto the immor|tal and invi&s;ible God; but alas! they come not to the know|ledge
<PB N="267" REF="020309_0267_0FAEF8F91553CB08">
of God by this. All that the prie&s;ts could do that the king of <HI>A&s;&s;yria</HI> &s;ent back, could not bring the <HI>Samaritans</HI> to the knowledge of the God of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> they only brought them to a report of &s;uch a God, that had &s;et up &s;uch a law: They had the report of it, and for fear that the lions &s;hould tear them in pieces, they would enter into that form, but they wor&s;hipped their own Gods &s;till.</P>
<P>So it is now, people do not come to the knowledge of the true God, the living God, by entering into any form of religion; for in&s;tance, prayer, hearing of any ordinance or church-fellow&s;hip, the&s;e give not men the knowledge of God, there is but one way to come to that, but one only. Men have found a great many, it is pa&s;t your skill and mine to reckon up the many ways that men have found out upon the face of the earth, how they might come to the knowledge of God, and to peace and reconciliation with him; but they have only played the fool, and &s;pent their time in vain, e&s;pecially they that own the &s;criptures of truth to be a true and faithful record of the mind and will of God, they play the fool abominably; for the &s;cripture that they give &s;o much reputation to in their profe&s;&s;ion doth te&s;tify the way is but one, and there is no other way for people to be reconciled to God, than by coming into Chri&s;t; to be found in him, to be regenerated and born into his nature, and have his qualities put upon them, <HI>that as he was pure, they may be pure; that he that &s;anctifieth, and they who are &s;anctified by him, may become both one, and &s;o be reconciled to the Father through him.</HI> This you know is the common profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tendom, or at lea&s;t of our nation. And in other nations, the common profe&s;&s;ion is, there is no Me|diator but one, no Reconciler but one. Indeed &s;ome others hold there may be other Mediators, and that there are others that may contribute to them by their mediation, and by their prayers and merits, but the generality of the nations are otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Now for people to fall out, and &s;ay, my way is be&s;t, and thy way is not be&s;t, and to fall into conte&s;ts about many ways, when the &s;cripture concludes there is but one way, is not well; we had better all agree about this doctrine, that there is no po&s;&s;ibility of reconciliation with God, &s;ince we are
<PB N="268" REF="020309_0268_0FAEF8FAC19092E0">
fallen out with him, and &s;ince &s;in hath made a &s;eparation, there is no way of being reconciled again to God, but by and through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; nor by him neither, unle&s;s we receive of his Spirit to quicken us; nothing can quicken us, enliven us, or recommend us to God, but the Spirit of Chri&s;t operating and working in our hearts, that he may prepare us for the Father's kingdom.</P>
<P>If people would agree upon this, there would be an end of all labour, and toil, and jangling about the right way, for the con&s;equence and conclu&s;ion would be this: That the man who doth not know him&s;elf the &s;anctifying power of the Spirit of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, he is out of the way to reconciliation with God, let his form and profe&s;&s;ion be what it will: If therefore he be reconciled to God, it mu&s;t be by and through the Mediator, and he will never recom|mend him to the Father till he hath made him a temple to let in the Spirit of Chri&s;t, to work in his heart, to fit him for the kingdom of God: And men have no other way to come to it; for though they be zealous in every prayer and form, it &s;ignifies nothing to any great purpo&s;e, their hope will be fru&s;trated; <HI>there is no other way,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>of coming to the Father, but by me; I am the way, the truth and the life.</HI> If I am out of the truth, I am out of the way; and if I am out of the way, then I cannot come to the end of the way. This is plain rea&s;oning among men: If I tell a lie, that is out of the truth: If I have vain communication, or deceive or wrong my neighbour, that is out of the truth; if I am in that which is manife&s;ted in my con&s;cience to be con|trary to the truth, I am out of the way; though I be &s;trict in that way, as to profe&s;&s;ion, yet I am out of the way to God, I am out of the truth; there is no way to God but by Chri&s;t, who is the way, the truth and the life; whoever is out of him, is out of the way; which made the apo&s;tle &s;ay, <HI>that his labour, endeavour and de&s;ire was, that he might be found in Chri&s;t, not having his own righteou&s;ne&s;s, but having on the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>Many men think to recommend them&s;elves to God by their righteous, ju&s;t and hone&s;t dealings, and doing wrong to nobody. This is good in it&s;elf, but doth not recom|mend us to God, unle&s;s it be done by the righteous and
<PB N="269" REF="020309_0269_0FAEF8FB6434D068">
holy Spirit of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, unle&s;s it be of his working; he mu&s;t have the working of righteou&s;ne&s;s and truth in us; he mu&s;t plant it, and it mu&s;t grow by his working, if it be acceptable to the Father; <HI>for without me,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>you can do nothing.</HI> A man out of Chri&s;t, a &s;tran|ger to his Spirit, may do &s;omething, but nothing avail|able to the well-being of his &s;oul, 'till he have reconciliation by Chri&s;t Je&s;us: If he be reconciled to God, this Mediator mu&s;t be the Reconciler, and he mu&s;t fit and prepare him for reconciliation with the Father.</P>
<P>All the divi&s;ions, &s;orts and &s;ects of religion, mu&s;t all come to an end; if this mea&s;uring line be laid to them, they all appear too &s;hort; and there is nothing will do a man good, but that religion that obligeth and ties him to the good plea&s;ure of God, through the Spirit of the Mediator, which he feels working in him, by which he is rai&s;ed from death to &s;ome degree of life: When he is &s;en&s;ible what a burthen &s;in is to his life, that godly life which he hath, he is bur|thened with every &s;in, and oppre&s;&s;ed with every vain thought, and every vain word, if he be not in &s;ome mea&s;ure quickened, he is not &s;en&s;ible of this burthen; but being quickened, he is &s;en&s;ible of the burthen that lies upon his life, by rea&s;on of his &s;in; and then, being under the weight of his &s;in, he calls to God for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; he cries to God to help him; he now knows that he hath &s;triven and labour|ed in vain. O God of all grace, if thou vouch&s;afe&s;t not help to my &s;oul, if thou do&s;t not interpo&s;e by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of thy grace, I cannot overcome this &s;in. There is a con|tinual cry to God for divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and as they cry to God for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he mini&s;ters a&s;&s;i&s;tance to them, by which they are able to overcome the enemy of their &s;ouls, and all temptations when they come: And when a man finds &s;uch divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, his faith is &s;trengthened and con|firmed, and &s;o he <HI>fights the good fight of faith,</HI> and at la&s;t gets the victory; victory over his &s;in, and his own lu&s;ts, and concupi&s;cence, and victory over the a&s;&s;aults and tem|tations of the adver&s;ary, and at la&s;t he comes, through the grace of God, <HI>to deny all ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, and to live righteou&s;ly, &s;oberly and godly in this pre&s;ent world.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="020309_0270_0FAEF8FC0CE4C418">Now when people do thus, it is by the grace of God. This life of righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;obriety and godline&s;s, is not the effect of their labour and exerci&s;e, and of their endea|vours herein, but it is the effect of the holy Spirit that hath been the teacher. When you &s;ee a man has become a good &s;cholar, eminent in all &s;orts of learning, you will conclude he did not attain to all this of him&s;elf, he did not learn this and the other language, this and the other art and &s;cience of him&s;elf; no, he had &s;ome judicious and able ma&s;ter and teacher, who communicated of his learn|ing and knowledge to his di&s;ciple and &s;cholar: This is the efficient cau&s;e of his improvement. Now if a man, by the grace and the Spirit of God, and the teachings of it, live a holy, godly life, this is the effect of &s;omething; he did not always live &s;uch a life, how comes he to live &s;uch a life now? Is it by his own indu&s;try, labour and exerci&s;e? No, it is by being exerci&s;ed, taught and led by the Spirit of God; &s;o that it is the effect of the grace of God that he &s;hould live &s;uch a holy life, this is the meritorious cau&s;e of it, as he is a creature, and by this only acceptable to God in Chri&s;t the Mediator.</P>
<P>Thus a man comes to be ju&s;tified and accepted, not becau&s;e he is a godly man, but is made &s;o by the Spirit of God: <HI>You are not under the law,</HI> &s;aith the apo&s;tle, <HI>but under grace:</HI> You are under the teachings of it, under the directions of it: Grace can reprove people; for that grace and that truth that comes by Chri&s;t, and manife&s;ts it&s;elf as a light in the hearts of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, reproves their &s;in, and calls them out of it; it reproves them for it, and exhorts them to leave it, both at one time; &s;o that we mu&s;t acknowledge all our righteou&s;ne&s;s, holine&s;s and obedience to be of God, and all that we do in order thereunto, as it is done by the teaching, by the influence and operation of the grace of God given us in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; it is the effect of him who is our Mediator, he worketh it in us, and for us, of his good plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>If we be ju&s;tified, we are not ju&s;tified for a righteous, holy life, and for our obedience; but we are ju&s;tified through Chri&s;t, who worketh a godly life in them that believe, &s;o that a man is not ju&s;tified by any other way or means; and all

other ways a man takes of being reconciled to God, are vain and fruitle&s;s, and have been &s;poken again&s;t by all that were moved by the Holy Gho&s;t in the New Te&s;tament. Saith the prophet, <HI>what, &s;hall I come before the Lord withal?</HI> I am fallen under death and &s;in, and in a &s;eparation from God, I would fain be reconciled to him; what &s;hall I do to be reconciled to God? He goes about to reckon without Chri&s;t, and without faith and holine&s;s. <HI>Shall I take a thou&s;and rams, and ten thou&s;and rivers of oil?</HI> Shall I come nearer &s;till? <HI>Shall I make an offering of the fruit of my body, for the &s;in of my &s;oul? Shall I offer my fir&s;t-born to God,</HI> that I may not be rejected and brought to a &s;epa|ration from him? Thus men when they come to be &s;en|&s;ible, do feel in them&s;elves that all this is to no purpo&s;e: The an&s;wer comes, thou maye&s;t live, but all thy contri|vances about making an offering are vain: <HI>He hath &s;hewed thee O man! what to do.</HI> It is not thy finding this way and that way, viz. thy rams, and thy oil, and thy fir&s;t-born; it is no way of thy devi&s;ing and imagining that can recon|cile thee to me, <HI>I have &s;hewed thee, O man, what is good.</HI> What is this that is &s;hewed? It is compri&s;ed in a &s;hort compa&s;s, <HI>it is to love mercy, to do ju&s;tice, and to walk humbly with thy God.</HI> Will this &s;erve without offering rams and oil, and offering my fir&s;t born? This will do if thou can&s;t but <HI>love mercy</HI> when it is &s;hewn thee; that is, embrace mercy, and love it. He hath &s;hewed mercy to all men; then love it and receive it; <HI>do ju&s;tly,</HI> leave every thing that is unrighteous, and do that which is ju&s;t in the &s;ight of God, but do not boa&s;t of thy ju&s;tice and righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, but <HI>walk humbly with thy God;</HI> here is the whole duty of man. Here is no dependence on dead works, or my own exertions, in order to my ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>Indeed the con&s;ideration of the&s;e kind of le&s;&s;ons do corrupt &s;ome men, and put them upon doing this or that, and upon forbearing this or that, and hath brought many to confe&s;&s;ion and great ab&s;tinence, and put them upon great doings, thinking this would an&s;wer the ju&s;tice of God; I have loved mercy, and given all I had to the poor. If I do ju&s;tly, and ab&s;tain from this and the other liberty, if I walk humbly, that is, if I humble my&s;elf by
<PB N="272" REF="020309_0272_0FAEF9016A673598">
this and the other manner of pennance and contrition, then I do what God requires, and then I have plea&s;ed God.</P>
<P>Now all that have gone this way to work, to do ju&s;tly, and love mercy, and to make them&s;elves humble, and hum|bled them&s;elves in &s;uch a low manner, they have mi&s;&s;ed the mark. <HI>He hath &s;hewed thee, O man! what is good;</HI> that it is impo&s;&s;ible for fallen man to an&s;wer this him&s;elf; he may be convinced of his duty to do ju&s;tice, but by his own power and &s;trength he cannot do it; there are &s;o many temp|tations from without, and &s;o many from within, &s;uch a propen&s;ity in nature, that will prevail again&s;t all the bonds of charity that he can make.</P>
<P>Therefore is <HI>help laid upon one that is mighty;</HI> without the grace of God that comes by Chri&s;t Je&s;us, a man can never do right, though convinced: Tho' the Lord hath &s;hewed him what is good, he &s;hews us that we are unable of our&s;elves; he hath taken care to &s;end his Son: <HI>God hath &s;o loved the world, that he hath &s;ent his Son into the world,</HI> that he might help tho&s;e that have need of help, that every one that is in di&s;tre&s;s might have an eye to Chri&s;t, <HI>the author and fini&s;her of their faith;</HI> when men have a reference to their faith in Chri&s;t, this makes their duty acceptable; I cannot do it except the Lord &s;trengthen me; therefore I will have re&s;pect to the Mediator, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who was &s;ent for a light into the world. God &s;ends forth his grace for every one to lay hold on, who generally believe, that tho' they are unable to do what God requires, yet he will enable them to do it; <HI>for as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the Sons of God,</HI> tho' they were the devil's children before; <HI>he is the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to-day, and forever.</HI> He abides always the &s;ame in his grace to men, he is in his operation to them the &s;ame; he offers grace to them that are in a frame of mind to receive it; they may know that his power will give them ability, and that what&s;oever they do of them&s;elves will prove fruitle&s;s, becau&s;e it is not done in Chri&s;t's name and power, and &s;o not acceptable to God.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t thing that we are to be concerned about, if we will be religious, and concern our&s;elves about divine matters, about the kingdom of God and the world to come,
<PB N="273" REF="020309_0273_0FAEF90278B97430">
is, to &s;ee what frame of mind we are in at pre&s;ent, whe|ther the high places are taken away, whether we are not exalted in our own conceits of knowledge and wi&s;dom, and reckon not to be beholden to him for his grace. If we be highly conceited, and think we can &s;tand upon our own legs, the high places are not taken away: Men are not in this &s;tate prepared to &s;eek the God of their fa|thers; therefore, let every one turn to God, and &s;ee how it is with you; &s;ee whether there be a mind brought low enough to be &s;ubject to Chri&s;t, and to the gracious teach|ings of his Spirit.</P>
<P>A man may &s;ay, I can make a &s;ermon, I can make a prayer and exhortation, and I can make a book, and &s;end it abroad, I can do all this by my own parts and abilities; &s;o thou maye&s;t, and maye&s;t make it all full of good words, but thou can&s;t never make it acceptable to God; for <HI>without me,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>you can do nothing.</HI> Thou mu&s;t have the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, el&s;e thou can&s;t not make a good prayer, nor a good book, nor any thing good; God e&s;teems <HI>the very plowing of the wicked to be an abomination</HI> to him. Where the mind is not exerci&s;ed by the Spirit of God, if he &s;hould pray from morning to night, and &s;pend all his days in pen|nance, it will do him no good. <HI>If I,</HI> &s;aith <HI>David, re|gard iniquity;</HI> you may think I am a man in favour with God, a man after God's own heart; <HI>yet if I regard ini|quity in my heart, the Lord will not hear my prayer.</HI> What &s;ignifies prayers and &s;ermons, made of good words, if they come not from a heart &s;eparate from iniquity?

<HEAD>SERMON XXIV. CAPTIVE SINNERS <HI>&s;et free by</HI> JESUS CHRIST.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Preached at DEVONSHIRE-HOUSE, <DATE>April 29, 1688.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>THERE is nothing will make people live to God, but that which they receive from God. For as all men are by nature in a &s;tate of death, &s;o there mu&s;t be &s;omething beyond nature to make them alive again; and this is what every one ought to wait upon God for, that you may feel &s;omething that is &s;upernatural, and that you may be acquainted with God's gift; <HI>the gift of God,</HI> &s;aith the &s;cripture, <HI>is eternal life.</HI> Many find a life in this world, that is not the gift of God. The life that people have in &s;in, it is not the gift of God; the delights and plea&s;ures of this world are become a life unto them. The world is that to which every one mu&s;t die; they that are not dead to that, they all live to them&s;elves, they do not live to God, for none can live to God, but by the life that comes from him. That which people re|ceive of man, gathers them unto man; that which they receive of God, carries them to God.</P>
<P>So men have made gatherings, and have communicated of what they have to one another, and by virtue there|of, have made them a people: Many men have gathered many people, many churches, and they live to them that gathered them; they do not live to God, for want of re|ceiving &s;omething from God, but all they that come to re|ceive the gift of God, they die to the world, and they come to live &s;uch a life as the world doth not love, doth not care for, and hath no plea&s;ure in: <HI>If you were of the world,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>the world would love you; but becau&s;e you are not of the world, they hate you.</HI> How &s;hould this be under&s;tood, were not they &s;ome of the men of that generation? How doth he mean they were not of the world? <HI>Why, I have taken you out of it,</HI> &s;aith he; and yet they were there &s;till, and they were named by certain names, the &s;ons of &s;uch and &s;uch men; yet for all that,
<PB N="276" REF="020309_0276_0FAEF904599E1330">
they were not of the world; and that which differed in them was, being made partakers of that life which the world knew not.</P>
<P>And &s;o there will be an enmity in the world again&s;t the life of holine&s;s; they will hate any body that lives in it; and as it was then, &s;o it is at this day, they that are of the world, they hear and receive tho&s;e things that are of the world, from the men of this world; but they that are of God, they hear them that are of God, and they receive the things of God, and their greate&s;t comfort and joy that they have is in their communion with God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, through whom, as through a conduit, the ble&s;&s;ings of the father are mini&s;tered to them, and through whom, as from the fountain of life, their life is renewed from day to day.</P>
<P>But the&s;e things are hid from the world, <HI>from the wi&s;e and prudent of it;</HI> they cannot dig into the depth, nor a&s;cend to this height; they cannot <HI>comprehend the length and the breadth of the things of God, which are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us;</HI> they may reach unto &s;omething of the love of God, that is in the creation; they can tell when the &s;un &s;hines upon them, and when the rain falls upon their fields; and when it falls in due &s;ea&s;on they call it a ble&s;&s;ing; and while the covenant with winter and &s;ummer remains, they look upon it as comfortable, and perhaps &s;ometimes will be&s;tow a &s;ay|ing, <HI>I thank God for it.</HI> All the&s;e things are beneath us, and <HI>there is neither love nor hatred known by them all. I &s;aw the wicked, &s;aith one, I beheld his dwelling place, and he flouri&s;hed like unto a green bay-tree,</HI> and was wicked &s;till, notwith&s;tanding all this.</P>
<P>But now, they that &s;ee where they live, that live to God, they can &s;ay, that their leaf never withers, but they <HI>bring forth their fruit in due &s;ea&s;on;</HI> but he did not &s;o. But the wicked man <HI>that flouri&s;hed like a green bay-tree, behold I looked, and he was removed, and his place was no more to be found:</HI> There came a bla&s;ting upon all his ble&s;&s;ing and his flouri&s;hing came to an end; his riches peri&s;hed, and his good things pa&s;&s;ed away from him. But the man <HI>who&s;e delight is in the law of God,</HI> and makes it his plea&s;ure both night and day, he is <HI>like a tree planted by the rivers of water, who&s;e leaf never fades, and brings forth his fruit in due &s;ea&s;on.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="020309_0277_0FAEF90528E39EF0">But this is hid; there is no body in the world but would have &s;omething of this life too; they would be &s;ure of eternal life, but they would not die to the other life, they would not be crucified to the world, they would not be &s;eparated from their lovers; if they could get into the &s;tate of a righ|teous man, an hour or two before they die, when they are &s;ure they &s;hall die, it would plea&s;e them; but to live that life that is to God, is to die to the world, and to part with that they have, their comfort, their joy, their peace and honour, and all their worldly enjoyments in it, before they can come to receive the gift of God, they think is hard: But they that look after it, and have a mind to find it out, without parting with the world's life, they deceive them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Do not you &s;ee how men have deceived them&s;elves in the&s;e days? They have &s;ought after the kingdom of God till they are &s;cattered in their own way; they are quar|relling about their own way, as if they never had any &s;crip|ture to be their rule: They cry the &s;cripture is their rule; this is the way to eternal life, &s;aith one; and this is the way, &s;aith another; and the one and the other &s;ay all the&s;e ways are fal&s;e &s;aving their own; and all the&s;e contenders about the way to eternal life, they all &s;ay the &s;cripture is the rule.</P>
<P>And yet the &s;criptures &s;peak of the way too, and tell us the way plainly, the way to re&s;t, peace and life eternal. If the &s;criptures had been &s;ilent in it, and had &s;aid nothing but of genealogies and hi&s;tories of armies and wars, it had been &s;omething; but the &s;criptures of the Old and New Te&s;ta|ment &s;peak of a certain way to eternal life, and &s;ay it is the way of holine&s;s, <HI>a way &s;hall be ca&s;t up for the redeemed and the ran&s;omed of the Lord to walk in, and the way|faring man, though a fool, &s;hall not mi&s;take in it.</HI> Though he never took a degree at the univer&s;ity, he &s;hall not err in it; though he be a fool in the account of the world, and never under&s;tood Greek or Latin, yet he &s;hall not err in this way.</P>
<P>The way that leads to the kingdom of God, is called the way of holine&s;s; but while many have been reading in their books, they have been contending for a way of unho|line&s;s; no wonder then they have been quarrelling about
<PB N="278" REF="020309_0278_0FAEF906019BB288">
it, and have all mi&s;&s;ed it, and that in the main point of all: Let them make a way, which way they will, and frame it ever &s;o wi&s;ely, according to the be&s;t wit they have, be it a way that hath all material qualifications that &s;hould make it a way of holine&s;s, the&s;e men may walk in it, but they will never find the way to the kingdom of God, though they have &s;ought it out: Go to one place and another place, and ask them what is your way? Our way, &s;ay they, is the right way, the mo&s;t &s;ure and certain way that can be found for people to walk in: But whither will it lead me? It will lead thee to the kingdom of God: That is it I would have; but will it lead me to holine&s;s? No, never in this world, thou mu&s;t never come to holine&s;s; do the be&s;t thou can&s;t do here, it is but &s;in; the be&s;t day's work thou make&s;t is but &s;in; the be&s;t child of God on earth cannot live a day without &s;in: Do you hold out that in your way? Yes; then I have done with that, and mu&s;t go to another people.</P>
<P>So many have gone many ways to the kingdom of God, and when the up&s;hot is come, they have found every way a polluted way, a &s;inful way; I know this way will never lead me to God; &s;in fir&s;t led me from God; I had been well enough as I was created at fir&s;t, if I had never &s;inned again&s;t God; a &s;inful way will lead me from God. It is again&s;t common &s;en&s;e, and again&s;t rationality, to &s;ay we did fir&s;t go from God by &s;in, and mu&s;t go to God again by a &s;inful way. Who will believe that &s;uch a way will lead men to God's kingdom? and that any way will lead men to God, that will not lead them to holine&s;s?</P>
<P>The P&s;almi&s;t &s;aith, <HI>if I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me;</HI> though a man keeps clo&s;e to meet|ing, and ordinances, and duties, and performances, iniquity it &s;eems remains &s;till; there is no rooting it out in this world. This continuing and remaining with a man, makes all his performances, and duties, and prayers unacceptable to God; they are all turned back again upon him, and ca&s;t as dung upon his face, and true enough too; &s;o that here is no coming unto God in this way; the comers thereunto know well enough they are not reconciled to God, if they are men that are con&s;cientious.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="020309_0279_0FAEF90A9DC2B2B8">There are a &s;ort of people &s;o &s;tupid and &s;ordid in their judgment, that if a man tells them they are reconciled to God, they will believe him though con&s;cience reproves them a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> hundred times a day. If the par&s;on of the pari&s;h &s;ay, that he hath made <HI>this child an heir of the kingdom of God and an inheritor of eternal life;</HI> I know &s;ome have believ|ed it forty years after, and have born them&s;elves up upon this man's word all their life: Do you think there is any danger of me, that in bapti&s;m was made an inheritor of eternal life, and an heir of the kingdom of God? God hath not appointed ordinances in his church for nothing.</P>
<P>I &s;peak not of &s;uch &s;ordid hard-hearted people, that never entered into them&s;elves to know how it was with them, whether they are converted; but I &s;peak of &s;ober con&s;ci|entious people, that do not de&s;ire to be cheated in a point of &s;alvation, though they have been deceived a great while, they may be undeceived: Then they mu&s;t take this for certain doctrine, that nothing can reconcile them to their Maker but that which takes away &s;in. <HI>God hears not &s;inners,</HI> he will never be reconciled to a man in this world, as a &s;in|ner; but there are many thou&s;ands (ble&s;&s;ed be God) in this age, as well as in other ages, that were &s;inners, and reconciled to God through Chri&s;t, and had remi&s;&s;ion of &s;in; but never any man in his &s;in was reconciled to God, though he did believe the truth, if he did not come to the &s;anctification of the &s;pirit, he could never be recon|ciled to God.</P>
<P>So that there hath been, in all ages, a way of the work|ing of the Spirit of God in the hearts of them that be|lieve, to prepare them for the &s;inle&s;s kingdom, for that glorious kingdom, into which nothing that hurteth, de|fileth or corrupteth, can enter. And becau&s;e we cannot enter with corruption and defilement, he hath appointed the mini&s;tration of his Spirit to work out that which might hinder the clean&s;ing of us from &s;in, that we might <HI>have an abundant entrance into his glorious kingdom;</HI> &s;o that whil&s;t they &s;ay there is an impo&s;&s;ibility of living without &s;in, I had as lief they had &s;aid, there is an impo&s;&s;ibility of entering into the kingdom of God; for never any &s;hall come into the kingdom of God, but tho&s;e that are with|out &s;in; for there is no purgatory after death.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="020309_0280_0FAEF90BE12951A0">The Papi&s;ts have a better conceit than the Prote&s;tants in that re&s;pect: The Prote&s;tants conceive &s;in to be ex|pelled at the point of death; and they &s;ay, all the &s;ins of believers, all the guilt of &s;in, after we are believers, is par|doned, forgiven and done away, by the death of Chri&s;t upon the cro&s;s; we will have it, if we can get it. If men can imagine a way into the kingdom of God, they will have one. They believe that a man may &s;in and con|tract no guilt; and that he may &s;in till his dying day, and then all &s;in &s;hall pa&s;s away, and he &s;hall enter into God's kingdom. The Papi&s;ts &s;ay none can come to Heaven till they be purged from &s;in; and they &s;ay God hath appointed a place for that purpo&s;e, and per&s;ons mu&s;t go into pur|gatory, and they mu&s;t lie there till they are purged, and purified, and fitted for Heaven.

The Prote&s;tants have got a way to help them&s;elves, and the Papi&s;ts, al&s;o, to help them&s;elves, and both lie under danger: As for the Papi&s;ts, if their prie&s;ts mi&s;take, and there be no &s;uch place as purgatory, then they mu&s;t be brought back to the doctrine of the &s;crip|ture, which declares, <HI>that as death leaves us, &s;o judg|ment &s;hall find us; and as we &s;ow &s;o we mu&s;t reap; if we &s;ow to the fle&s;h, then of the fle&s;h we &s;hall reap corruption.</HI> Then the Prote&s;tants, likewi&s;e, if they mi&s;take in &s;aying, a man may act &s;in and yet contract no guilt, then they mu&s;t be brought back to the doctrine of the &s;criptures, that tell us, <HI>the &s;oul that &s;inneth mu&s;t die: If a righteous man for|&s;ake his righteou&s;ne&s;s, and doth that which is evil, his righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall be remembered no more, but in the &s;in that he hath committed he &s;hall die.</HI></P>
<P>This is &s;ound doctrine: I had rather tru&s;t the doctrine of the prophets and apo&s;tles than the doctrine of all others, either Prote&s;tants or Papi&s;ts; and had rather depend up|on their doctrine for &s;alvation, that were in&s;pired by the Holy Gho&s;t, than upon tho&s;e doctrines that &s;ay, there is no in&s;piration now-a-days. Some conceive this &s;cripture
<PB N="281" REF="020309_0281_0FAEF90CD20CED08">
may be interpreted thus and thus; and others conceive it means &s;o and &s;o, but we mu&s;t, &s;ay they, &s;ubmit to better judgment: I am a fallible man, I &s;ubmit it to better judgments. Now when people are concerned for immortality and eternity, to have &s;uch things di&s;hed out in &s;uch a manner, what &s;ouls are &s;o dull but they would be&s;tir them&s;elves, and con&s;ider and look about them be|fore they go hence, and how it &s;hall go with them when they are gone?</P>
<P>We are now to work out our own &s;alvation, that is on our part: None ever have wrought out this &s;alvation, it is wrought out on God's part already, and it is to be made ours; he that is our Saviour, he <HI>hath &s;uffered for our &s;ins, and ro&s;e again for our ju&s;tification; he was made to us, of God, wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification, and redemp|tion.</HI> Now wi&s;dom &s;ignifies the opening of the coun&s;el of God; righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ignifies the &s;ubjection of our wills to the will of God; &s;anctification &s;ignifies obedience to the Spirit of Chri&s;t. Sanctification &s;ignifies obedience to &s;omething; to what? what &s;hall we be obedient unto? what is our rule? <HI>He that is led by the Spirit of Chri&s;t, he is his; but he that is not led by the Spirit of Chri&s;t is none of his;</HI> &s;o that it is plain, &s;anctification &s;ignifies obe|dience to the Spirit of Chri&s;t, and redemption &s;ignifies buying again, or &s;etting free from bondage.</P>
<P>We know when our friends are in captivity, as in Tur|key, or el&s;ewhere, we pay down our money for their re|demption; but we will not pay our money if they be kept in their fetters &s;till. Would not any one think him&s;elf cheated, to pay &s;o much money for their redemption, and the bargain be made &s;o that he &s;hall be &s;aid to be redeemed, and be called a redeemed captive, but he mu&s;t wear his fetters &s;till? How long? as long as he hath a day to live.</P>
<P>This is for bodies; but now I am &s;peaking of &s;ouls, Chri&s;t mu&s;t be made to me redemption, and re&s;cue me from captivity. Am I pri&s;oner any where? Yes; <HI>verily, verily, he that committeth &s;in,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>he is a &s;ervant of &s;in,</HI> he is a &s;lave to &s;in: If thou ha&s;t &s;inned, thou art a &s;lave, a captive, that mu&s;t be redeemed out of captivity; who will pay a price for me? I am poor, I have nothing,
<PB N="282" REF="020309_0282_0FAEF90D4FC3ACD0">
I cannot redeem my&s;elf, who will pay a price for me? There is one come, who hath paid a price for me; that is well, that is good news, then I hope I &s;hall come out of my captivity. What is his name, is he called a Redeemer? So then I do expect the benefit of my redemption, and that I &s;hall go out of my captivity. No, &s;ay they, you mu&s;t abide in &s;in, as long as you live: What benefit then have I by my redemption? I could have been in captivity no longer; if I had not been redeemed, I mu&s;t wear my &s;hackles and fetters &s;till, and be &s;ubject to my old ma&s;ter and patron, and when he will have me be drunk, I mu&s;t be drunk; and when he will have me be unclean, I mu&s;t be unclean.</P>
<P>Thus many profe&s;t Chri&s;tians there be (you &s;ee it with your eyes) that will tell you they believe all the articles of the creed, and they have been baptized into the Chri&s;tian faith, and can rehear&s;e all the principles of the Chri&s;tian re|ligion, and perform the duty of Chri&s;tians in going to church, &s;aying their prayers, and giving alms too it may be; they are &s;uch as would be called Chri&s;tians, they would be called &s;o, yet they <HI>are not redeemed from their vain conver&s;ations;</HI> for what makes their &s;hackles and fetters about them? When their old ma&s;ter bids them be drunk, they will be drunk; and when he bids them commit whoredom, or lie, or cheat their neighbour, they will do it: You do believe the devil leads you to this; you will not &s;ay the Spirit of God led you to it. If one demand, how did you do it? You &s;ay, the devil prevailed upon me: What, hath the devil power over men after they are redeemed? What &s;ort of re|demption is this? Then comes in the old &s;hift again, we are redeemed from the puni&s;hment of our &s;in, but not from the act of it.</P>
<P>Now if tho&s;e that are called ranters had told me this tale, it had been like them; but when doctors of divinity tell us this tale, it is &s;o unlike divinity, that it is <HI>carnal, &s;en&s;ual and devili&s;h.</HI> To tell believers they are redeemed from the puni&s;hment of &s;in, but not from the act of &s;in; that this is the benefit which we receive from Chri&s;t's &s;ufferings; that we may &s;in on, free co&s;t; that there is no guilt contracted by it; will any man or woman, that under&s;tand they have a &s;oul, venture their immortal &s;ouls on this divinity? I
<PB N="283" REF="020309_0283_0FAEF90E156B5278">
hope not. They will not venture their &s;oul on this founda|tion-doctrine: I hope God will awaken the con&s;ciencies of people, that they will not hazard their &s;ouls upon &s;uch a carnal, devili&s;h foundation; that if the devil &s;hould preach, he could not preach a wor&s;e doctrine than this, to per&s;uade Chri&s;tians they may live in &s;in, and &s;in will not hurt them, nor impair or break their peace with God, and recon|ciliation with him.</P>
<P>I will tell you how it hath been with me; in my child|hood, if I had &s;poken a vain word, or a fal&s;e word, I had contracted &s;uch a guilt thereby, that I was a&s;hamed to draw near to God, to pray to him; I knew he would not hear liars, I knew there was no way to be accepted without repentance and amendment of life. I believe others have met with the &s;ame dealing from God, by the &s;ecret &s;trokes of conviction that have come upon their hearts, when they have &s;inned again&s;t God.</P>
<P>So that I am &s;till of the mind, that the per&s;ons that depend upon this kind of doctrine, do at &s;ometimes, e&s;pe|cially when &s;ickne&s;s comes, and death looks them in the face, or in times of common contagion or pe&s;tilence, at &s;uch a time they have a weight of guilt upon their con|&s;ciences; for this doctrine will not &s;upport them at death, but that then they believe they have contracted guilt, or committed &s;in.</P>
<P>I have wi&s;hed many times that the Lord would open the eyes and hearts of the people of this city and of this na|tion, to &s;ee how mi&s;erably they have ventured their &s;ouls. Will merchants in this city ever venture their goods at &s;uch a rate as men commonly venture their &s;ouls? What, will they venture their goods in a &s;hip without a bottom, before &s;he goes to &s;ea? Now this doctrine hath not a foundation; &s;hall I believe a per&s;on that tells me I do not contract guilt, when I feel it upon my heart; when I commit whoredom and drunkenne&s;s, and cheat my neighbours, &s;hall any one per&s;uade me that I do not contract guilt?</P>
<P>O friends! we are &s;peaking of great matters; it is about eternity, that we are &s;peaking, it is about the hazard of eternal happine&s;s; therefore I pray, let every one be &s;erious, and con&s;ider what I &s;ay, for I &s;peak in God's name, and on

your behalf: Men are to come to a true &s;earch in them|&s;elves, what a life it is that they live. Many &s;upport them|&s;elves by the <HI>doctrines and precepts of men,</HI> and they buoy them&s;elves into conceits of &s;alvation; let them examine whether it be a life that hath its &s;upport from the Spirit of God; this is material for every one to con&s;ider. There are none can live to God, but by the life they receive from God; <HI>the grace of God, which bringeth &s;alvation, hath appeared to all men.</HI> Now here is an univer&s;al doc|trine.</P>
<P>There are a &s;ort of men in this city and nation that tell us, that &s;aving grace is given only to the elect. Saving grace is given to <HI>all men;</HI> but you mu&s;t con&s;true tho&s;e words, <HI>all the elect,</HI> where they are &s;omewhat injurious, and would ca&s;t off the condition of the text, if they make a di&s;tinction in the latter part of the &s;entence, for it will not be good &s;en&s;e: <HI>The grace of God that bringeth &s;al|vation, hath appeared to all the elect, teaching us to deny all ungodline&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. Here is <HI>us</HI> taken out of the <HI>all.</HI> The &s;ame grace, that is our teacher, appears to be the teacher of others, though they <HI>turn it into la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> The grace is the &s;ame, though they make many &s;chool-di&s;tinc|tions between common and &s;aving grace. The apo&s;tle ex|plains it, by telling what grace he means; <HI>the grace of God, which bringeth &s;alvation, appeareth to all men,</HI> and that is <HI>by teaching us;</HI> what doth it teach? I pray con&s;ider it; it teacheth us <HI>to deny all ungodline&s;s and all worldly lu&s;ts, and to live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly in this pre&s;ent world.</HI> Where is &s;in now, if a man be taught by this grace, and the dictates of it. Can a man live in &s;in, and yet live righteou&s;ly, &s;oberly and godly too? Can a man live in &s;in, and yet deny all ungodline&s;s at the &s;ame time? Where have men's under&s;tanding been, that cannot under|&s;tand their mother tongue, and con&s;ider &s;en&s;e? Where are men's under&s;tandings that will &s;ay, I may <HI>deny all ungod|line&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts,</HI> and yet follow the lu&s;ts of my own heart? You would think I &s;peak non&s;en&s;e if I &s;hould &s;peak thus; and yet we have been put off with &s;uch non&s;en|&s;ical &s;tuff as this. We mu&s;t pray to God to &s;end <HI>his holy Spirit into our hearts, to enable us to live godly, righteous

and &s;ober lives,</HI> and at the &s;ame time believe that we &s;hall never do it, but that it is a bu&s;ine&s;s of impo&s;&s;ibility.</P>
<P>Now when men come to lay the&s;e things together, and when they con&s;ider between God and their own &s;ouls, how it is with them, many are amazed to think they &s;hould ever be put off with &s;uch incongruous, di&s;agreeing, and di&s;&s;onant things, that are not con&s;i&s;tent with one another.</P>
<P>But do you think it is po&s;&s;ible for any man to live without &s;in? Yes, or el&s;e I would &s;ay it is impo&s;&s;ible for any to be reconciled to God; for God will never be re|conciled to &s;inners, as &s;uch; for his bargain and covenant is made of &s;uch kind of articles. <HI>Wa&s;h ye, make ye clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes. Cea&s;e to do evil; learn to do well,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Then come and let us rea&s;on together, &s;aith the Lord; tho' your &s;ins be as &s;carlet, they &s;hall be as white as &s;now; tho' they be red as crim&s;on, they &s;hall be as wool,</HI> I&s;aiah i, 16, 17; &s;till the&s;e are the terms, <HI>put away the evil of your doings,</HI> then patience, mercy and long-&s;uffering, &s;hall be extended to you; <HI>God will give grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold;</HI> what, from tho&s;e that &s;ay their prayers, or go to the church or meeting? No, but <HI>but no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly;</HI> P&s;al. lxxxiv, 11. The&s;e are the men.</P>
<P>And when the Lord di&s;tingui&s;hes by his prophet whom he would have among them, he &s;peaks of a &s;ort of people that called upon the name of the Lord; <HI>tho&s;e that feared the Lord, and &s;pake often one to another;</HI> that is, of the goodne&s;s of God; they were a &s;ort of people <HI>that trem|bled at the word of God;</HI> a &s;ort of people that did not do as others did, hunt after plea&s;ures, riches, and the ho|nours of the world, but to be acquainted with the inward word that wrought upon their hearts; <HI>in that day that I make up my jewels, they &s;hall be mine, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> Who&s;e &s;hall the others be? Thou wilt own the&s;e for thine, but who&s;e &s;hall the others be, that think not upon thy name, and tremble not at thy word? There is a place for them too: <HI>Tophet is prepared of old, made both wide and large; the fuel thereof is fire and brim&s;tone, and much

wood, and the breath of the Lord kindleth it.</HI> This is for all that are wicked, and that work iniquity.</P>
<P>This is in the Old Te&s;tament; then comes the New Te&s;tament, in <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Revelations;</HI> there is a &s;eparation again: There are a &s;ort of people which are called the true wor&s;hip|pers, and the angel was commanded to go and mea&s;ure the temple, and tho&s;e that wor&s;hipped therein: The outward temple was not mea&s;ured, but left for the <HI>Gentiles</HI> to tread in, and left without the mea&s;ure; <HI>for without are dogs and &s;orcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and who&s;oever loveth and maketh a lie.</HI> And then the Lord &s;peaks to his prophets in the Old Te&s;tament again; <HI>if thou put a difference between the precious and the vile, then thou &s;halt be as my mouth unto them;</HI> but if thou huddle them altogether, and <HI>&s;ew pillows under elbows,</HI> then thou &s;halt not be as my mouth.</P>
<P>So that in all ages God aimed at a &s;eparation of the &s;tate and condition of his people; and one &s;ort of people were purified, through the &s;anctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth; and another &s;ort were un&s;anctified and unpurified, and remained in their &s;in; and the end of Chri&s;t's coming into the world, it was to call people to repen|tance; <HI>he came not to call the righteous, but &s;inners to re|pentance,</HI> and to leave off their &s;in. <HI>To as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the &s;ons of God, to as many as believed on his name.</HI> Who&s;e &s;ons were the other? They made as high a rattle of profe&s;&s;ion as the other: He tells them who is their father, <HI>you are of your father the devil;</HI> and he did orderly prove it, and that was thus; that they did the devil's works, <HI>ergo,</HI> they were the devil's children. It was Chri&s;t him&s;elf, the greate&s;t doctor of divinity that ever was in the world, that &s;pake the&s;e words: And this is the manner of logic whereby he argues with the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> to make them believe that they were the devil's children; they that do the devil's works are the devil's children; but <HI>you do his works,</HI> therefore you are his children; &s;o they &s;ought to kill him, they could not bear &s;uch arguments.</P>
<P>If one &s;hould go and &s;earch out a people in this city and nation, and &s;ee one man of this religion, another of
<PB N="287" REF="020309_0287_0FAEF911CFDF6290">
that religion, and pick them out, and u&s;e this argument with them: There is a man profe&s;&s;eth high, he profe&s;&s;eth a light within; if you look upon his deeds they are dead and dark, why then he is one of the devil's children: If you put me to prove this, I &s;ay he doth the devil's works, he is an extortioner, a deceiver, and a drunkard and unclean per&s;on, and doth the devil's works, and &s;o is none of God's children. And &s;o go to another &s;ort and u&s;e this argu|ment, it is &s;afe enough, you can never fail in this kind of argument which Chri&s;t u&s;ed; and if people would u&s;e it with them&s;elves, and think them&s;elves no better, then we &s;hould have people confe&s;s them&s;elves the devil's children.</P>
<P>None come to be God's children, till they come to ac|knowledge their lo&s;t e&s;tate, their deplorable condition; that they are fallen from God, and through &s;in and ini|quity are got into a nature that is at enmity with God; then they will cry out, <HI>who &s;hall deliver me from this bo|dy of death,</HI> and child&s;hip of &s;atan, this heir&s;hip of wrath? I am an heir of an inheritance; I am an heir of wrath, and I would fain part with this inheritance and heir&s;hip, and have an <HI>inheritance with the &s;aints in light:</HI> We &s;hall never know this, till we come to divinity without &s;ophi|&s;try, and without tricks and quirks, and come to Chri&s;t's rea&s;oning. He that doth the devil's work is the devil's child; then they will confe&s;s this is of the devil, and the other is of the devil. This is an evil work; and I &s;ee that I have need to be brought into another condition.</P>
<P>When people come to an acknowledgment of the truth, and of their own condemnation, then they are one &s;tep towards redemption and &s;alvation. No one ever took a &s;tep towards their &s;alvation, till they acknowledged their own condemnation. <HI>He that &s;anctifies, and they that are &s;anc|tified, are all of one; and they that are joined to the Lord, are one Spirit. An evil tree,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>cannot bring forth good fruit.</HI> When Chri&s;t &s;pake this, he &s;pake it to men and women, and he &s;pake it of men and wo|men, and not of trees: And when he &s;aid, <HI>no man can gather grapes of thorns, nor figs of thi&s;tles,</HI> he &s;peaks of a generation of men: As if he had &s;aid, this thorn mu&s;t be tran&s;lated and changed into another nature before it can
<PB N="288" REF="020309_0288_0FAEF91442B33D08">
bring forth grapes; and this thi&s;tle mu&s;t be changed into another nature before it can bring forth figs.</P>
<P>There mu&s;t be a change in the nature of man before there can be a change of the fruit and effect of his do|ings; <HI>what&s;oever he &s;ows, that he &s;hall al&s;o reap; what|&s;oever a man doth in the body, he mu&s;t give an account thereof at the day of judgment; for the books will be open|ed, and men judged according to the things written in tho&s;e books.</HI> If there be a book for thee and me, I will war|rant thee there is a great deal in it; there is a recorder and a clerk for the book, which God hath opened in every man's con&s;cience; and there is &s;et down every man's tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions and his &s;ins: Saith one, <HI>thou ha&s;t written my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions as with the point of a diamond;</HI> thou ha&s;t engraven it &s;o deep, that it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould ever be blotted out again: Some have had their &s;ins &s;o deeply engraven in their con&s;cience, that they have thought they would never be blotted out, they were writ|ten as with the pen of a diamond.</P>
<P>When people &s;ee and con&s;ider that they have ventured their &s;ouls upon &s;uch &s;light grounds, I hope they will be awakened to &s;eek after righteou&s;ne&s;s; when they &s;ee there is nothing good in them: Where there is any thing good, it is God that hath given it to them. Some will &s;ay, if I be perver&s;e, corrupt and wicked, I cannot help it, there|fore I mu&s;t be beholden to my Maker to help me, el&s;e I mu&s;t never be helped. Now, becau&s;e God knows that we are helple&s;s, <HI>he hath laid help upon one that is mighty,</HI> that is, our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and Chri&s;t <HI>hath &s;ent forth his Spirit into the world to convince the world of &s;in, and to lead his people into all truth:</HI> And this grace that comes by Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath been &s;o univer&s;ally &s;hewed, and &s;o univer&s;ally extended to all men, that I never met with a man yet that had none of it: But let them be as bad and as dark as they could, yet the light of Chri&s;t &s;hined in that darkne&s;s, into the darke&s;t heart, that ever I met with in all my life: He &s;heweth men, that <HI>his light &s;hineth in dark|ne&s;s, and the darkne&s;s cannot comprehend it.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore the work that God hath &s;et us about, and the &s;ervice which he requires at the hands of many of
<PB N="289" REF="020309_0289_0FAEF915EC243390">
us, is to turn men from their own darkne&s;s unto the light of Chri&s;t their Saviour, and from the devil's power, that hath en&s;laved them, to the power of God that can redeem them; and yet we are far enough from that which they call <HI>free will;</HI> it is God's will <HI>that every one &s;hould be &s;aved:</HI> But &s;ome will not be &s;aved, they will keep their own wills and not re&s;ign them up to God; they have a free will to go to de&s;truction. As for &s;alvation, if they will obtain it, they mu&s;t part with their own wills, and they mu&s;t take a yoke and burthen upon them, before they can be &s;aved: If people can have their wills, they will not take Chri&s;t's yoke upon them: He that will be Chri&s;t's di&s;ciple mu&s;t deny his own will and take up his daily cro&s;s; the&s;e are the terms of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>But you will &s;ay, no man, by all the power he hath, can redeem him&s;elf, and no man can live without &s;in.</P>
<P>We will &s;ay amen to it: But if men tell us, that when Gods power comes to help us, and to redeem us out of &s;in, that it cannot be effected, then this doctrine we can|not away with, nor I hope you neither. Would you ap|prove of it if I &s;hould tell you, that God puts forth his pow|er to do &s;uch a thing, but the devil hinders him? That it is impo&s;&s;ible for God to do it, becau&s;e the devil doth not like it? That it is impo&s;&s;ible that any one &s;hould be free from &s;in, becau&s;e the devil hath got &s;uch a power in them, that God cannot ca&s;t him out?</P>
<P>This is lamentable doctrine: Hath not this been preached, this doctrine of impo&s;&s;ibility of living without &s;in? It doth in plain terms &s;ay, though God doth interpo&s;e his power it is impo&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e the devil hath &s;o rooted &s;in in the nature of man. Is not man God's creature, and can|not he new-make him, and ca&s;t &s;in out of him? If you &s;ay &s;in is rooted deeply in man, I &s;ay &s;o too; yet not &s;o deeply rooted but Chri&s;t Je&s;us is entered &s;o deeply in|to the root of the nature of man, that he hath received power to de&s;troy the devil and his works, and to recover and redeem man into his primitive nature of righteou&s;|ne&s;s and holine&s;s; or el&s;e it is fal&s;e, that <HI>he is able to &s;ave, to the uttermo&s;t, all that come unto God by him.</HI> We mu&s;t throw away the bible, if we &s;ay that it is impo&s;&s;i|ble

for God to deliver man out of &s;in. Is not Chri&s;t entered into the root of our nature? And hath he not taken upon him the &s;eed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> after the fle&s;h? Hath he not entered into the root of all men's natures, and <HI>ta&s;ted death for every man, that he might quicken every one that is dead in &s;ins and tre&s;pa&s;&s;es?</HI> All the&s;e things &s;peak the love of God to mankind, in order to their &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Much might be &s;aid to the&s;e things, the&s;e clouds of error and darkne&s;s that have over&s;pread the nation; yet, this I &s;ay, if one were to &s;peak of it ever &s;o long, it mu&s;t be by the eye that God gives you, that you mu&s;t &s;ee it; it is he that opens the hearts of men as he did <HI>Lydia</HI>'s: If there had not been the power of God that reached her heart, <HI>Paul</HI> could not have opened it.</P>
<P>When all is &s;aid that can be &s;aid, the coun&s;el of God which hath &s;ounded in your ears, is recommended to you, that every one may retire in quietne&s;s and &s;tilne&s;s of mind to wait for the feeling of that quickening power of the Spirit of Chri&s;t that is &s;ent into the hearts of men; that it may open your eyes to &s;ee your pre&s;ent &s;tate; then you will &s;ee a better &s;tate, a further &s;tate, and when you &s;ee with your inward eye that your &s;tate is not &s;o good as you would have it to be, then tru&s;t and rely upon the all-&s;ufficient and powerful operation of God's Holy Spirit to mend your &s;tate, and give you power over your corrup|tions, and to go on from one &s;tep to another, towards the clean&s;ing and &s;anctification of your &s;ouls, &s;o that you may receive &s;omething from God to enable you to live to God; for all that you receive from men will only make you live to men, but that which you receive from God, will help you to live to God; that will purify you and &s;anctify you, <HI>and make you clean through the word:</HI> So through the word you will come to cleanne&s;s, purity and holine&s;s: And when you are come to the way of holi|ne&s;s, you may believe you have got into the way of God's kingdom, and never till then.</P>
<P>It is not enough to make a profe&s;&s;ion, but we mu&s;t live up to the profe&s;&s;ion of that religion that we make; it is not holding this tenet and the other tenet, and &s;aying, this mini&s;ter, I am &s;ure, preacheth the truth; thou maye&s;t be

a child of the devil for all that. I now &s;peak indifferently to all people, without re&s;pect to any &s;ort: They that be|lieve they are walking towards the kingdom of God, and yet their way is not a holy way, they have cheated them|&s;elves, and deceived their own &s;ouls, and they had need look about them and take heed what they do; the gla&s;s is run|ning, and time is ha&s;ting away, and our life may end we know not how &s;oon. It is good to prize and improve time, while you have it, and bring your deeds to the light; &s;ee what reproofs, in&s;tructions, coun&s;els and openings you have met with from the Lord, and &s;ee how you have an&s;wered and been obedient to them, and &s;o you will come to take a &s;ound and infallible account of your condition; and if it be not &s;o good as it &s;hould be, wait upon the Lord to mend it; he that made you can mend you, he that made your ears, mu&s;t un&s;top your ears to hear the word of God.</P>
<P>To that power that carries on the works of &s;anctification and redemption by his word, to that word I mu&s;t leave you, and to his &s;pirit I commit you. This word will be with you, and if you part not with it, it will not part with you; it will go with you to your hou&s;es, and to your &s;hops, and to your beds; it will lie down with you at night, and ri&s;e with you in the morning: To that end, Chri&s;t is a leader and governor, and the captain of our &s;alvation, to lead the van, and carry you on in the way of &s;alvation; and <HI>as ma|ny as follow Chri&s;t, and are led by the &s;pirit of God, they are the children of God.</HI></P>

<Q><HI>My &s;heep</HI> (&s;aith the true &s;hepherd) <HI>hear my voice.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE &s;heep of the true fold hear the voice of Chri&s;t, the good &s;hepherd, and know the voice of &s;trangers too: But, &s;aith he, <HI>the &s;tranger they will not follow.</HI> This &s;cripture hath been a mark of di&s;tinction in all ages, that
<PB N="292" REF="020309_0292_0FAEF917D509F898">
hath been peculiarly be&s;towed upon the people of God, that they have had a di&s;cerning knowledge to make a certain di&s;tinction between them that were of God, and tho&s;e that were of the world: <HI>Now they that are of God hear us,</HI> &s;aith the apo&s;tle.</P>
<P>Now, that you may all find in your&s;elves this peculiar gift of God, to be able to under&s;tand and <HI>di&s;cern between the precious and the vile,</HI> that you might know the mini&s;tration of life from the mini&s;tration of death, you mu&s;t all be gathered inwardly into that which you have received of God; for they that are only exerci&s;ed with gifts and parts, and ac|quirements that appertain to this world, they have been always &s;ubject to delu&s;ions, apt to be led away into a by-path and crooked way, <HI>that leads to de&s;truction:</HI> But they that are under the government and direction of the gift of God, they have been able thereby to make &s;uch a di&s;|tinction of voices, and of &s;ounds, that they have been pre|&s;erved from the delu&s;ions of the age.</P>
<P>This was the difference of old between the prophets of God and the fal&s;e prophets, between the apo&s;tles of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the fal&s;e apo&s;tles; the difference was not &s;o much in their words, for they had in a great mea&s;ure the &s;ame words; if the true prophets u&s;ed to &s;ay, <HI>thus &s;aith the Lord,</HI> the fal&s;e prophets would &s;ay &s;o too; if the true prophets declared again&s;t &s;in, the fal&s;e prophets likewi&s;e would do &s;o; for the fal&s;e prophet &s;tole his word from his neighbour: But the greater matter by which the people of the Lord were pre&s;erved, was, that hidden and divine wi&s;dom they received of God, by which they di&s;|cerned the voice of the &s;pirit from the voice of &s;trangers, from the voice of them that were of the fle&s;h; and that was the cau&s;e that the Chri&s;tians in the primitive days did not adhere to, and follow tho&s;e fal&s;e apo&s;tles that came to them in their own names, and held <HI>a form of godline&s;s, but denied the power of it.</HI></P>
<P>But they among them in whom their witch-crafts did enter, they went away from the &s;pirit, and &s;ought to be <HI>made perfect in the fle&s;h;</HI> they went to the outward ob|&s;ervation, and to the <HI>beggarly rudiments of things that pe|ri&s;h with the u&s;ing,</HI> and from <HI>the law of the &s;pirit of life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="020309_0293_0FAEF918C9046538">And as it hath been in tho&s;e ages of which we have read, &s;o it comes to pa&s;s in this our age, in which a di&s;pen&s;ation of the &s;pirit of truth is manife&s;ted and revealed unto the children of men; there is a remnant that have received the te&s;timony of eternal life, and have believed the te&s;timony, and waited on him of whom the te&s;timony is born, not to have life by the te&s;timony, but <HI>to have life in him;</HI> &s;o they receive their life by the mini&s;tration of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, and they live to God, and others who have received no life from him, but have a life in the words, and &s;ounds, and noi&s;es and terms, and di&s;tingui&s;hing phra&s;es of things, their life lies there, they live not to God but to them&s;elves, their glorying is not <HI>in the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t,</HI> but in the words and out&s;ide of things; &s;o that every one had need, at &s;uch a time as this, to approve their hearts unto the Lord; who knows the in&s;ide of people's profe&s;&s;ion, the in&s;ide of their religion, that knows how the heart is concerned towards God, and what they &s;ay and do upon the account of his &s;ervice, &s;o that all that are met together might come to re|ceive more and more of the life and virtue that &s;anctifies the &s;oul of him that receiveth it.</P>
<P>For, alas! my friends, it is not the gathering together of the mo&s;t excellent words about religion, and about wor&s;hip and &s;ervice, which will approve any man in the &s;ight of God; that is but the painting of a &s;epulchre, and covering the rottenne&s;s that is in many; but the Lord &s;ees into the in&s;ide of every profe&s;&s;or, and who&s;oever <HI>names the name of Chri&s;t and departeth not from iniquity,</HI> they do but take his name in vain, and contract a guilt upon their own &s;ouls; &s;o that every one that &s;eemeth to be religious, ought to enquire whence their profe&s;&s;ion &s;prings; if it &s;prings from a real po&s;e&s;&s;ion of a mea&s;ure of that which &s;anctifies the life, and &s;hews it&s;elf forth, in its working and operation, many times abundantly more, than it doth in word and profe&s;&s;ion; it manife&s;teth it&s;elf in holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, to the honour of God; it is the aim and de|&s;ign of all &s;uch to exalt the name of him whom they pro|fe&s;s, by holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hining forth in their works, for it will never &s;hine through words alone; many good words may be &s;poken, yet God not glorified, but his
<PB N="294" REF="020309_0294_0FAEF91AB9200218">
name may be di&s;honoured by them; but who&s;oever comes to feel that which is life in them&s;elves, they know what will honour God, they feel the birth immortal that is of God, of his own begetting by the word of truth.</P>
<P>This living birth is that which brings forth living prai&s;es; the other is but fle&s;h, <HI>that which is born of the fle&s;h is fle&s;h,</HI> and it glorifies the fle&s;h, and when the fle&s;h is mo&s;t of all glorified, mo&s;t of all exalted, it is then but <HI>as the flower of the field,</HI> it is then <HI>cut down and withereth; the &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> &s;hines with the beams of the ever|la&s;ting glory of God, and cau&s;eth it to wither and come to naught,</P>
<P>So friends, let your minds be gathered inward, that you may be able in your own &s;elves, by virtue of the divine gift of God, to di&s;tingui&s;h between the voice of the true &s;hepherd, and the voice of a &s;tranger, &s;o that your minds may not follow a &s;trange voice, that you may follow the Lord with your whole heart, <HI>with a full purpo&s;e of heart;</HI> for there is a real word of prophe&s;y di&s;covered in the inward parts, which doth <HI>di&s;tingui&s;h between the precious and the vile</HI> in every one's particular; and that which is precious in one, it an&s;wereth to that which is precious in another; and that which is vile in one, it an&s;wereth to that which is vile in another.</P>
<P>For there is an inward and &s;ecret <HI>my&s;tery of iniquity,</HI> as well as a my&s;tery of godline&s;s. <HI>The my&s;tery of godline&s;s</HI> is when <HI>God is manife&s;ted in the fle&s;h;</HI> the my&s;tery of ini|quity is, when the wicked one is making him&s;elf manife&s;t, and appears and di&s;covers him&s;elf in the fle&s;h, that he may ri&s;e up and glory in the fle&s;h.</P>
<P>Now the eternal truth, which never changeth, this is that which giveth a di&s;cerning, this hath always put a difference between the true and fal&s;e prophets, the true and fal&s;e apo&s;tles, and between the true and fal&s;e mini&s;ters; the dif|ference hath not been &s;o much <HI>in words as in power,</HI> as the apo&s;tle &s;peaks concerning &s;ome in his days, that had endeavoured to deceive, and to draw men a&s;ide from the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel; <HI>when I come,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>I will know.</HI> Now, he does not a&s;&s;ert, that he will pay particular at|tention to their words, whether they were judicious or no;
<PB N="295" REF="020309_0295_0FAEF91AE0CE6448">
for he &s;ays, I will not know their words, but their pow|er. How &s;hould he know their power if he were not in the power him&s;elf? Now this divine power, as every one acquaints him&s;elf with it, it worketh unto the &s;anctification of them, when they have fellow&s;hip with the &s;tirrings and movings of all others that are partakers of it: This is that which will e&s;tabli&s;h and confirm your minds in the true faith and &s;implicity of the truth, that you turn not a&s;ide to the right hand or to the left. If you have regard to the principle of divine truth that you have received from God, then you can receive confirmation from any one that hath a mea&s;ure according to it. There is a <HI>mea&s;uring line,</HI> and the <HI>reed of the &s;anctuary,</HI> that <HI>mea&s;ureth the temple and all that dwell therein,</HI> that mea&s;ures them with one reed and one mea&s;ure, and every one an&s;wereth to that mea&s;ure, according to the &s;tature and degree of growth of the grace of God they arrive to; and now they are come to a fixed foundation.</P>
<P>Others there are in the world, that have laid their foun|dation upon this creaturely help, and the other creaturely help, upon this man, and the other man; but now true Chri&s;tians come to have their foundation, their rooting and building upon Chri&s;t Je&s;us, upon that word of life that fir&s;t of all gathered their minds into a de&s;ire after holi|ne&s;s, into a de&s;ire after acquaintance with God that made them.</P>
<P>You that are true Chri&s;tians can remember, how you were begotten, and that which did beget you; that word of God that is incorruptible, that is immortal, that was not of a dying quality, that need not be &s;upported by this, and that, and tne other means, but it hath its &s;upport in it&s;elf, it hath its nouri&s;hment in it&s;elf, and it grows up in it&s;elf, and every one that receiveth it they grow up in it, until they come more and more to partake of the life and qualities of it; <HI>that as he is, &s;o they may be in the pre&s;ent world.</HI></P>
<P>But this is never known, but where the word of God hath its free pa&s;&s;age: Many have <HI>ta&s;ted of this word of God,</HI> and by ta&s;ting of it, have been acquainted with the <HI>power of the world to come;</HI> they knew well enough the power that would bring forth another world, a <HI>new Hea|ven,
<PB N="296" REF="020309_0296_0FAEF91B91B6BE88">
and a new earth,</HI> and righteou&s;ne&s;s in it; many have felt the power that have never continued to &s;ee the work|ing of it, never continued to &s;ee and witne&s;s what this power would work; going a&s;ide from the power of the world that was to come, they have never &s;een the com|ing of it, but <HI>their fooli&s;h hearts have been darkened again, and their imaginations have grown vain,</HI> and they have con|ceived to them&s;elves a fal&s;e liberty to the fle&s;h, and their wills have been &s;trong, and have prevailed over them; that though they had ta&s;ted of the powers that did belong to the world to come, they never &s;aw the working and ope|ration of that power to bring to pa&s;s that which by &s;ight and vi&s;ion they did behold.</P>
<P>Therefore it is needful for every one of you, in every &s;tate and condition the Lord hath brought you into, to keep your&s;elves in a deep humility; to know the afflicti|ons, temptations and trials you are under, and to exerci&s;e your minds, not only on account of what you have got over, but let every one know the &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> and condition in which at pre|&s;ent they are labouring; for when &s;ome come to look at what &s;ufferings and difficulties they have got over, they are apt to be exalted above mea&s;ure, and lifted up in their minds; let every one con&s;ider what is their pre&s;ent &s;tate and work; their help lies in that condition. Some have always a foundation of their faith pre&s;ent with them, that they may feel the object of their faith where they hope for help, where they hope for comfort and &s;trength to be pre&s;ent with them.</P>
<P>Now every one that believeth in the word of God, their care is, that they may know this word of God, that they may hear it, feel it, and behold the beauty of it under the exerci&s;es of it; how it conducts and leads, how it coun|&s;elleth and advi&s;eth, that &s;o, in all things they are to pa&s;s through, they may not be as tho&s;e that have run into it; as tho&s;e that do this and that of their own wills, but may be properly followers of &s;omething.</P>
<P>I go into this, or that, or the other thing, not to do mine own will; I do not run into it, but I am led into it; my leader goes before me, the word of God, that hath conducted me and led me: I am a follower of God
<PB N="297" REF="020309_0297_0FAEF91D318E37E0">
in all his di&s;pen&s;ations, and in all his leadings and guid|ings; I am to follow him, for he teacheth me his way, he in&s;tructeth me in the true way: The be&s;t of all his &s;cholars and di&s;ciples, they are to be led and guided into that work and &s;ervice they are to do, that they may run into no irregularily or ab&s;urdity, for he will lead you into holine&s;s, righteou&s;ne&s;s and humility, where all become the &s;ervants of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and &s;ervants to one another: There is a mutual concord and harmony in the work of this &s;pirit, in the &s;ervice of this power, where every one finds what they are appointed and directed to, and all the members of the body of Chri&s;t know they ought not to be disjointed and rent, and &s;eparated one from another, but <HI>tied together in joints and bands, to edify one another in the love of God;</HI> &s;o that here is one &s;pirit that hath been the guide of this one people in all ages.</P>
<P>Many people have been guided by many guides, and they have been &s;cattered, divided and &s;eparated one from another, and have been under this, that and the other name; but all God's people have been guided by the Spirit of Chri&s;t, that univer&s;al Spirit that is one with God. In the Old Te&s;tament times, and the New Te&s;tament times, they were all led by the univer&s;al Spirit of Chri&s;t, and they were <HI>of one heart, and of one mind, &s;erving the Lord;</HI> there was a concord and unity among them; and if at any time any di&s;cord or divi&s;ion happened, it was becau&s;e the <HI>roaring lion that goes about continually &s;eeking whom he may devour,</HI> had found &s;ome or other that he might de|vour, and draw into his &s;nares and gins; for there are &s;ome that he may, and &s;ome that he may not. Who are they that this roaring lion may de&s;troy? The devil knows who tho&s;e are that he may prevail upon; he knows that tho&s;e which are in the hands of God are out of his reach: <HI>My Father,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>is greater than all, and none &s;hall pluck them out of my Father's hands;</HI> yet doubtle&s;s tho&s;e that are in the Father's hands are tempted and tried, the roaring lion goes about &s;eeking to devour them if he might; a man that he devours, he &s;wallows up with prejudice, enmity, covetou&s;ne&s;s and pride, and he will lead him into any evil thing; he hath many gulphs to &s;wallow men up
<PB N="298" REF="020309_0298_0FAEF91DF9609558">
in, but if he meet with one that is kept in God's hands, he knows &s;uch a one is out of his reach, and he is not able to catch him.</P>
<P>If he meet with a man that he can prevail over, as he did over our father <HI>Adam</HI> and mother <HI>Eve,</HI> &s;uch as are in their own hands, that &s;tand upon their wit and parts, and knowledge and eloquence; tho&s;e that &s;tand upon the&s;e things as their foundation, they are in their own keeping; the&s;e are they whom he may devour and catch, and en&s;nare in one or other of his gins, and &s;wallow them up in one of his gulphs and temptations: But &s;eeing God hath opened and manife&s;ted the&s;e things by his Spirit, and &s;eeing the &s;ecret wiles of <HI>&s;atan</HI> are di&s;covered and made known by the &s;hining of his light, how ought every one that is a be|liever of the truth, to depend upon God for his protection, and be careful that he goes not out of his Father's hands, that he never tru&s;t him&s;elf to his own keeping for his &s;e|curity and pre&s;ervation, le&s;t he meet with a temptation that may &s;wallow him and devour him.</P>
<P>I remember our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t when he was upon earth, he put his di&s;ciples in mind of what happened long before, <HI>remember Lot's wife:</HI> You may take notice of her, the power of God took hold of her and brought her out of <HI>Sodom,</HI> and was leading her to a place of &s;afety, but &s;he had &s;omething of <HI>Adam</HI>'s apo&s;tacy in her nature, &s;he looked back, and was turned into a pillar of &s;alt. Our Saviour was plea&s;ed to make u&s;e of this pa&s;&s;age that happened &s;ome hundreds of years before, to &s;hew how &s;he failed of coming to the place of &s;afety, though &s;he was led out of <HI>Sodom</HI> by the hands of one of the angels of God. O! remember her, &s;he was turned into a pillar of &s;alt, and this remains in|&s;tructive to this day.</P>
<P>If we remember where our &s;afety is, and from who&s;e hands we mu&s;t expect it, we need not go to look at <HI>Lot</HI>'s wife. We have &s;een many in our days that have &s;tood fair for redemption, they have had a power revealed to them, that is able to redeem them, and &s;ave them to the uttermo&s;t; but afterward by exalting them&s;elves above this power, and taking the government of them&s;elves into their own hands, they have robbed God of his glory, and he
<PB N="299" REF="020309_0299_0FAEF91F8C3E1820">
hath withdrawn him&s;elf from them, and then it was with them as with <HI>Soul,</HI> when the Lord departed from him, <HI>the evil &s;pirit entred into him.</HI></P>
<P>We have before our eyes from day to day, tho&s;e that have known the beginning of the redemption of God's pow|er, and have been in a great mea&s;ure brought out of <HI>So|dom,</HI> and out of the way of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and they have had opened to them <HI>the my&s;tery of the kingdom of God</HI> for their encouragement, but at la&s;t they have taken and arrogated tho&s;e gifts to them&s;elves, and looking upon them&s;elves as far excelling others, magnifying their parts as if they were their own, when they were the gifts of God. Then the Lord hath left them, to let them &s;ee whether they could &s;tand of them&s;elves, and they have fallen, and been taken in the gins and &s;nares of the devil, who, <HI>like a roaring lion, is going about continually, &s;eeking whom he may devour.</HI></P>
<P>Now, my friends, it greatly concerns us all to know what refuge we have to fly to, in a time of trial; we have a time of trial now, tho' not a time of external &s;uffer|ing and per&s;ecution, and enduring hard&s;hip yet upon us, to try our faith and tru&s;t in God; yet we have no rea&s;on to be &s;ecure, carle&s;s nor remi&s;s in our pre&s;ent duty, <HI>nor to put the evil day far from us,</HI> but to be in the exerci&s;e of humility and watchfulne&s;s as becomes Chri&s;tians; for there is now as much danger and peril in this time of liberty and tranquillity, as there was before.</P>
<P>If any one in the time of per&s;ecution and &s;uffering hath &s;aid within him&s;elf, I had better give over and part with the truth, and for&s;ake the ways of the Lord, and give over my te&s;timony for his name, for I &s;hall be undone and ruined in the world; this man by his carnal fears hath lo&s;t his te&s;timony.</P>
<P>So likewi&s;e if a man in this time of liberty and freedom of &s;erving the Lord, and bearing te&s;timony to his name, if he &s;hall not entirely tru&s;t in the Lord, to carry him on in his work and &s;ervice, and continue his dependence upon him, and wait for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Holy Spirit of God to work in him <HI>to will and to do of his good plea&s;ure,</HI> this man &s;hall lo&s;e his te&s;timony, as well as the other: There|fore, let every one of you keep up a dependence upon God's
<PB N="300" REF="020309_0300_0FAEF851591D7950">
Holy Spirit for carrying on the work which he hath begun in your &s;ouls; con&s;ider what work it is that Chri&s;t is now at in every one of you; I know what his work was when I was fir&s;t convinced, he was burning up and hewing down every thing that hindered his carrying on the work of &s;anctifi|cation and redemption, and firmne&s;s and &s;tability in the covenant of life and peace.</P>
<P>And now our meeting together ought to be in the name of Chri&s;t; I hope it is &s;o with mo&s;t of you: I hope it is not to &s;ee and hear what this or that man &s;aith, but to know within your&s;elves what part of the work of redemp|tion the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is carrying on, that you may join with him, and <HI>be a willing people in the day of his power,</HI> and &s;ay as <HI>Paul, Lord, what will thou have me do?</HI> If thou wilt have me part with my all, Lord here it is, I offer it up; and if thou wilt have any &s;ervice done, Lord here I am, <HI>&s;peak, for thy &s;ervant heareth;</HI> let there be in every one of you an attentivene&s;s, and an humble waiting upon the Lord, and &s;ay as the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>behold, as the eyes of &s;ervants look unto the hands of their ma&s;ters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hands of her mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;o our eyes wait upon the Lord our God until he have mercy upon us.</HI></P>
<P>Whenever a Chri&s;tian hath his dependence upon God's wi&s;dom and power, &s;uch a one &s;hall never want wi&s;dom, the Lord will give him wi&s;dom to pre&s;erve him again&s;t all the wiles of &s;atan; and he &s;hall never want power, for the Lord will enable him to fulfil and perform what he re|quireth of him; he &s;hall be repleni&s;hed with judgment and under&s;tanding, ability and power, to direct him into the good ways of God, and to enable him to walk in them.</P>
<P>It is the earne&s;t de&s;ire of my &s;oul, that every one of you may be exerci&s;ed in tho&s;e things which are profitable for you, and which may be comfortable to your friends and brethren; that you may all grow up into a &s;tability and &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s in the good ways of the Lord, that you may not be &s;haken and to&s;&s;ed with every &s;torm and tempe&s;t; that when there comes a time for the trial of your patience, and fortitude and courage, you may not be to&s;&s;ed to and fro like children, but <HI>be &s;tedfa&s;t and unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord,</HI> that &s;o living in all holy

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE is no man can truly wor&s;hip God, till he comes to a mea&s;ure of certain knowledge of him; for all the wor&s;hip in the world where the veil of igno|rance &s;till prevails upon the mind, is all abominable; there is no acceptance with God: There mu&s;t be a knowledge of God before there can be a true wor&s;hipping of him; for they that wor&s;hip before they know God, <HI>they wor|&s;hip they no not what;</HI> they wor&s;hip a God they have heard of, but do not know; &s;o every one that would be a true Wor&s;hipper, mu&s;t fir&s;t come to that which giveth a true knowledge, that rai&s;eth up a certainty in the mind, <HI>this is the Lord, we will tru&s;t in him; this is our God, and we will &s;erve him.</HI></P>
<P>And that all people might come to this certainty of knowledge, therefore it is that <HI>God hath &s;ent forth his Spirit,</HI> that the things of God might be communicated by the Spirit of God, for without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this Spirit, men &s;eek after the knowledge of God in vain; if they &s;eek after the knowledge of God, they cannot find it, and if they &s;eek after the wor&s;hip of God, and after acceptance with God, they cannot find it; &s;o that all religion, and religi|ous performances, that people are exerci&s;ed in, where the &s;pirit of truth hath not the beginning, they will all prove fruitle&s;s in the end.</P>
<P>There are wi&s;e men in the world, who have employed
<PB N="302" REF="020309_0302_0FAEF852979F0AF8">
their wi&s;dom to find out the true God; but God in wi&s;|dom hath ordained, that the world by all their wi&s;dom &s;hall not know him; &s;o there is an end of all their labour: How &s;hall they know him then? As <HI>none can know the things of a man, &s;ave the &s;pirit of man that is in him, &s;o none can know the things of God, but the Spirit of God;</HI> &s;o that they that re&s;i&s;t the guidance, direction and coun|&s;el of the Spirit of God, are like unto tho&s;e that would enter into a hou&s;e or palace, and remember not the door that leads into it.</P>
<P>People would fain come into the divine knowledge and into the under&s;tanding of divine my&s;teries, but they would come by it another way; they would &s;tudy for it, they would learn it by arts and &s;ciences, they would attain it by their own indu&s;try; and herein they labour to excel one another. If there comes a man among them that tells them, friends you are all out of the way, then they are angry, and in&s;tead of enquiring what is the way, they are angry that their way mu&s;t be rejected. Friends, you will never come to the knowledge of God but by the Spirit of God; then they mock, and then they &s;coff and &s;corn the doctrine of the Spirit, for the teaching of the Spirit hath been the common &s;corn and deri&s;ion of our age.</P>
<P>It is &s;o in our day with many; if they cannot come to the knowledge of God any other way but by the Spirit, they would deny to make u&s;e of that, to be &s;ubject to that, and the&s;e put their tru&s;t in their own power and indu&s;try, to find out the my&s;tery of the knowledge of God; <HI>&s;o they are ever learning, but are never able to come to the knowledge of the truth: How &s;hould they?</HI> How can a people come to a knowledge of the truth, without the <HI>&s;pirit of truth that reveals it?</HI> Can any come to the knowledge of Chri&s;t unle&s;s <HI>he that &s;ent him reveals him?</HI> Where are people's books? where are their bibles? where is their rule (they call it &s;o) that all their endeavours for many ages have proved fruitle&s;s in re&s;pect to the knowledge of God?</P>
<P>This is but your &s;ay &s;o, &s;ome may &s;ay; how doth it appear that we have not attained to the true knowledge of God? and to the true wor&s;hip, and to the true religion?</P>
<P>I will tell you how it appears; for all, in all ages, that
<PB N="303" REF="020309_0303_0FAEF8535401AC70">
have attained to the knowledge of God, they have been <HI>made partakers of his divine nature</HI> and his divine qualities; they have brought forth a &s;ort of fruit in their lives and conver&s;ations, that hath been of the &s;ame nature, it hath been holy and divine. They have known the &s;anctifier, and they have been a &s;anctified people, &s;o they have become one with him, and have &s;hewn forth the beauty of holine&s;s in their lives, that is a demon&s;tration that may &s;hew the knowledge of God, for without it they live another life, an unholy one, a corrupt one, a life of &s;elf-love, a life of pride, vanity and enmity, and that they never had from God, but from another root; a life of iniquity and &s;in, it came from another &s;eed; &s;o that they are &s;till without the knowledge of God.</P>
<P>And again, all that have come to the knowledge of God, they have tru&s;ted in him; that people cannot do now-a-days, except here and there a few that do know him; the generality of the age they cannot tru&s;t God; they mu&s;t have &s;omething el&s;e to rely upon, and tru&s;t to, for in him they cannot tru&s;t. Now the Lord &s;aid by the prophet of old, <HI>they that know my name will tru&s;t in me;</HI> that is enough if people know God, <HI>whom to know is eternal life, even to know thee the only true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent:</HI> This is life eternal; if people were come to this divine knowledge, they would never take care or &s;tudy for any refuge, or &s;et up this, or that, or the other thing to lean upon. A rich man he tru&s;teth in his riches, one tru&s;teth to one thing and another to another, but they would tru&s;t in the living God, and he &s;hould be their God and their rock, and they would venture their con|cerns upon him, both in this world and that which is to come, if they did but know him. People may talk as much as they will, but he can never, properly, be &s;aid to be my God, and thy God, till we ca&s;t our care upon him, and can venture our concerns upon him, both in this world and that which is to come; and can &s;ay, he is our God, and our reliance and dependence is upon him.</P>
<P>Now this is the effect and con&s;equence of this know|ledge of God; &s;uch as come to partake of it, they &s;hall have no need to be bid to wor&s;hip him. You &s;hall have
<PB N="304" REF="020309_0304_0FAEF8578D20B7C0">
no need to make a law, that this people &s;hall wor&s;hip the God that they know; there needs no law to command the people of God to wor&s;hip him; his <HI>law is written in their hearts;</HI> and they that know him, will wor&s;hip him. There was never any man on earth, that had the knowledge of the true and living God, that needed be put upon wor&s;hip|ping him, that needed a law to oblige him to it; for the very knowledge that is given of God through Chri&s;t, this brings forth naturally an adoration of the invi&s;ible power which men put their tru&s;t in; it produceth an adoration that is true wor&s;hip; it cau&s;eth an humble reverence of that power; it brings the &s;oul upon its knees, as it were; it brings the &s;oul to &s;toop and bend, and bow upon all occa&s;i|ons to God, as his God: It rai&s;eth his expectations to receive coun&s;el, and judgment, and under&s;tanding, from him, as the fountain of wi&s;dom; and hereby people are taught to wor&s;hip in the right divine knowledge.</P>
<P>But to tell men of the wor&s;hip of God before they know him; though you make as many laws as you will to force them to wor&s;hip that God they do not know, yet you can never do them any good, nor make their wor&s;hip accep|table, nor make them devout; you can never bring devo|tion, nor divine adoration into their hearts, by all the laws that you can make.</P>
<P>But there is a &s;pirit of life that &s;ets the &s;oul at liberty from its former bondage to &s;in and &s;atan; and when this law comes to be revealed in my heart, what &s;aith this law? Wor&s;hip God, give honour and glory to him. This law &s;aith, &s;ubmit thy&s;elf to him that redeemed thee, thou art his, thou art no more thine own; this law being written in the heart obligeth a man to a true wor&s;hip, and to <HI>wor&s;hip God in &s;pirit and truth,</HI> for this man hath done imagining among the Heathen, that there <HI>are Gods many, and Lords many:</HI> He hath done imagining what God is, and where he is, for he is now come to know him; he is in&s;tructed beyond the be&s;t &s;cholar in <HI>Athens,</HI> let him be ever &s;o mean and de&s;picable in the world; if it be ever &s;o poor a lad or la&s;s, they are beyond the be&s;t &s;cholar in <HI>Athens;</HI> for the be&s;t &s;cholar there came only &s;o far as to contra|dict their fellow &s;cholars: Some of them were for <HI>Mars,</HI>
<PB N="305" REF="020309_0305_0FAEF85B760B2CB0">
and &s;ome for <HI>Jupiter,</HI> &s;ome for one God and &s;ome for ano|ther: The&s;e &s;cholars, by &s;ome beam of divine light &s;hin|ing in them, had come to perceive that the influences that were in <HI>Mars, Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Venus,</HI> and the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Moon,</HI> and other planets, they received them from an high|er power, that is, God. They denied not that the&s;e pla|ets had power and influences given to them; &s;ometimes they are called heavenly bodies; the sky, or canopy of Heaven; and &s;un, moon and &s;tars are called heavenly bodies, they have power and influences; but this was given them, and that power mu&s;t be greater than theirs from whom they receive their power, virtue and influence, even that God who is the maker of all things. The &s;cholars at <HI>Athens</HI> under&s;tood &s;o much, as to &s;ee there was a God greater than the planets which the nations wor&s;hipped; they thought that God was to have an altar as well as <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Mars,</HI> and tho&s;e other Gods, and therefore they built an altar <HI>to the unknown God,</HI> whom they igno|rantly wor&s;hipped.</P>
<P>If thou and I are come to the knowledge of the true God, then we mu&s;t know more than the&s;e &s;cholars of <HI>Athens,</HI> who erected an altar <HI>to the unknown God:</HI> When the apo&s;tle came to preach divinity among the&s;e &s;cholars of <HI>Athens,</HI> who were ma&s;ters of arts and &s;ciences, he preached to them, &s;aying, that <HI>unknown God, whom ye ignorantly wor&s;hip, him declare I unto you;</HI> we do not need to declare to you the Gods of the nations, for you wor&s;hip them, but to declare to you the unknown God whom ye ignorantly wor&s;hip; the&s;e were the great &s;cholars of <HI>Athens</HI> that the apo&s;tle &s;pake to: What do&s;t thou declare of God? <HI>He is the God that made the world and all things therein, &s;ee|ing that he is Lord of Heaven and Earth, and dwelleth not in temples made with hands, neither is wor&s;hipped with mens hands, as though he needed any thing, &s;eeing he giveth to all life and breath, and all things, and hath made of one blood all nations of men to dwell upon the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitations, that they &s;hould &s;eek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us; for in him we live, move and
<PB N="306" REF="020309_0306_0FAEF85B9FB67C08">
have our being; for as certain al&s;o of your own poets have &s;aid, for we are al&s;o his offspring; for as much then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or &s;ilver, or &s;tone graven by art and man's device.</HI></P>
<P>Here is a way of learning, you need not turn over books any more; if I would know the true God, I mu&s;t know who gave me life and motion, and who created me, he is not far from me; and how &s;hould I find the knowledge of him? <HI>feel after him, if haply you may find him; for he is not far from any of us; in him we live, and move, and have our being;</HI> we cannot live without him one mo|ment; he giveth life, e&s;&s;ence and power, to all creatures in Heaven and Earth; we mu&s;t have him with us, or we cannot live; I die as &s;oon as my life departs from me, &s;o do you; if my breath and life continue with me, it is by the power of him that giveth it, in whom I live, and move, and have my being; &s;till it is in him that fir&s;t gave it.</P>
<P>Here all the great &s;cholars and philo&s;ophers were coun|&s;elled to feel after him; &s;o are all people now-a-days: This is our bu&s;ine&s;s, when we go to preach the know|ledge of God to them that want it; our commi&s;&s;ion runs not, that we mu&s;t read &s;uch a book, &s;uch an author, and turn over &s;uch a leaf, and there you &s;hall have a di&s;co|very, and a fair demon&s;tration of the attributes of God, of his wi&s;dom, power, goodne&s;s, mercy, omnipotence and omni&s;cience; our commi&s;&s;ion runs not that way, but our commi&s;&s;ion runs thus; that we <HI>turn people from darkne&s;s to light; and from the power of &s;atan to God;</HI> to turn their minds from that which may hinder the knowledge of Chri&s;t, from darkne&s;s, blindne&s;s and ignorance; God is not far from them; perhaps they might find him, if they did &s;eek after him.</P>
<P>There are a &s;ort of men now-a-days (&s;uch as were in former times) that <HI>&s;ay unto God, depart from us, we de|&s;ire not the knowledge of thy ways;</HI> &s;uch a &s;ort of people are dark, and blind and ignorant, and are like to conti|nue &s;o, that &s;ay to God, depart from us; God is come to them, but they bid him depart from them: We are

&s;ent to the&s;e people that are dark and ignorant, and have not the true knowledge of God, though they have abun|dance of notions, hear-&s;ay knowledge, learning and &s;pecu|lation; our bu&s;ine&s;s is to convince them of their igno|rance, <HI>and to turn them from darkne&s;s to light.</HI></P>
<P>There are a people that have mocked and &s;coffed at us ma|ny years; what, &s;ay they, is there a light within? Mu&s;t we go to the light within? Hath every body a light within?</P>
<P>Yes, I believe &s;o; and you mu&s;t believe &s;o too, if you will believe the &s;criptures. <HI>Chri&s;t is the true light,</HI> and he hath <HI>enlightened every man that cometh into the world.</HI> If he did light them, how did he do it? I will tell you, &s;ay they; he &s;pake a great many gracious words, and &s;ome|body hath writ them down. What, will this prove the light within? Becau&s;e we have got a New Te&s;tament, and Chri&s;t hath &s;poken a great many gracious words, and they are written down and recorded, doth this prove the light within? No, people might have been in darkne&s;s &s;till, for all the books of the New Te&s;tament, and the Old Te&s;tament too, and for all the books in the world; for they would never have conveyed light into the hearts and con&s;ciences of men, if God had not placed it there.</P>
<P>Indeed the&s;e books may be in&s;trumental, and God doth make u&s;e of them as a means for the conveying of light and grace, and working of true conver&s;ion; but the holy &s;criptures cannot do it of them&s;elves, unle&s;s there be a co-acting and co-operation of the Spirit of Chri&s;t with them; without this &s;pirit they cannot convey &s;aving light to us; how prove you then a light within? The apo&s;tle tells you, if you will believe him, 2 Cor. iv, 6; <HI>God, who commandeth the light to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s, hath &s;hined into our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> &s;o that every one that retireth into him&s;elf, will know quickly, and under|&s;tand his error, and confe&s;s that there is a light within, and that by this rule, becau&s;e there is &s;omething in the heart, that makes manife&s;t that which is reprovable; if they do or &s;ay a thing reprovable, that which manife&s;teth a thing is light; that which manife&s;teth dark words or works, is light.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="020309_0308_0FAEF85D1DE2B9F0">Now when they have found this <HI>light within,</HI> the next que&s;tion in controver&s;y is, whether this will give men &s;uf|ficient light for the true knowledge of God; whether this be &s;ufficient to bring a man to life and &s;alvation?</P>
<P>I am of that judgment, that it is &s;ufficient; and I be|lieve it heartily, and preach it boldly in the name of the Lord, that the light that &s;hines in your hearts, &s;hines there to give you the true knowledge of God, in the face of the Mediator, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. You cannot be|lieve this, you will &s;ay, for you have had this ever &s;ince you was a child, and you know not the lea&s;t good it hath done you; all our learned men and mini&s;ters, go to what &s;ort you will, they &s;peak very &s;lightly of it; this light within is nothing but natural con&s;cience, a poor light, it is but an <HI>ignis fatuus,</HI> that will mi&s;lead us. But let me tell thee, the rea&s;on why it doth thee no more good, is, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t been loo&s;e and wanton, and vain, and woulde&s;t not receive the reproofs of it; reckon up the time, and call to mind, when thou did&s;t receive the reproofs of it, then it did thee &s;ome good, and brought thee to remor&s;e, and brought angui&s;h and &s;orrow, and trou|ble into thy mind, and brought thee to a right &s;en&s;e of what evil thou had&s;t done; but if thou did&s;t not regard it, no wonder it did thee no good; its reproofs and coun|&s;els were like the &s;eed &s;own by the high way, <HI>the fowls of the air gathered it up,</HI> and it did not grow; that is, the devil plucked it up, and then the &s;oul lay as &s;eed that brought forth no fruit to God, and the devil might have what advantage he would.</P>
<P>I will tell you the rea&s;on why &s;o many learned men, men of great abilities, &s;peak &s;o &s;lightly and meanly of it, becau&s;e it hath done them no good, inward nor outward, that they know of: How &s;hould it do you good when it hath done them none? The rea&s;on why it doth them no good, is becau&s;e they do not believe in it; and did Chri&s;t ever do any body good that did not believe in him? <HI>He gave</HI> men <HI>power</HI> indeed <HI>to become the &s;ons of God,</HI> the greate&s;t good that they are capable of; but it was <HI>to tho&s;e that believed on his name:</HI> Were all they the &s;ons of God that heard Chri&s;t preach? No, &s;ome were
<PB N="309" REF="020309_0309_0FAEF85DD7B8F7B0">
the devil's &s;ons; our Saviour tells them, that they were of <HI>their father the devil, and they did his works;</HI> they came to meetings and heard Chri&s;t preach; he di&s;cour&s;ed to them, but it did them no good, for they did not be|lieve on his name.</P>
<P>And then it appears in the next place, that if this light be taken heed to, and if men come to be taught by it and receive in&s;tructions, they would then have it all for nothing, they would have it all for God's &s;ake; all the coun&s;els and under&s;tanding of divine my&s;teries, all the open|ings of God, and all their knowledge of God would be ob|tained without charge: What then would become of the trade of preaching Chri&s;t, and the attributes of God; then their &s;ilver-&s;hrine-trade will be &s;poiled, and then their <HI>Diana</HI> is gone; and this light hath done them no good inwardly becau&s;e of their unbelief; and it doth them no good out|wardly, becau&s;e it &s;poils their preaching trade, becau&s;e it teacheth men for nothing, but teacheth them, for God's &s;ake, the <HI>light of the knowledge of God, that &s;hines in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> wherein are the openings of the my&s;teries of the kingdom of God.</P>

but that will not do now, therefore there are people that know better than they, who &s;ee churches gathered of liv|ing &s;tones; men and women are gathered to the&s;e churches. Now the apo&s;tle &s;aith, the church is in God, the Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: If you will come to church you mu&s;t come to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the church is in God, the Fa|ther of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the general a&s;&s;embly, the congregation of his faithful people. What do you mean by a church? Ask a learned man, that under&s;tands Greek and Hebrew, what is the meaning of the word? A church, &s;aith he, is the congregation of the faithful, it is an a&s;&s;em|bly of the faithful people congregated together. Where mu&s;t they meet? they mu&s;t meet in the <HI>general a&s;&s;embly of the fir&s;t-born, who&s;e names are written in Heaven.</HI> The <HI>Hebrews</HI> were come to that church, though they lived many hundred miles a&s;under, in <HI>A&s;ia, Cappadocia</HI> and <HI>Bythinia: You are come to the general a&s;&s;embly of the fir&s;t-born;</HI> there is a prie&s;t, there is <HI>the high-prie&s;t of our pro|fe&s;&s;ion, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is a prie&s;t after the order of Melchi&s;edeck, not after the order of Aaron.</HI> How long is this prie&s;t like to &s;tay in his prie&s;thood? Forever; <HI>he is a prie&s;t forever, not after a carnal commandment, but according to the power of an endle&s;s life.</HI></P>
<P>The prie&s;ts that were after <HI>Aaron</HI>'s order, they could not continue: Death &s;natched one away, then they mu&s;t have another prie&s;t; but here is one that hath a prie&s;thood higher than the Heavens, by the power of an endle&s;s life: Here is the prie&s;t of God's church, and the teacher of God's people; &s;o that when God's people come to church, that is, to God the Father, there Chri&s;t teacheth them, according to the old prophe&s;y, <HI>I will teach my people my&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>We have laboured to bring people to this teaching, that they might come to the knowledge of the living God.

<P>Though tho&s;e that &s;et up wor&s;hip in the church, talk of divinity and religion in every part of it, yet the &s;ub&s;tance of all the &s;hadows of the law are fulfilled in the go&s;pel; the &s;ub&s;tance of all the modes, and rites, and forms of reli|gion, are fulfilled in the go&s;pel-way: So then let every one compare and examine their &s;tate, and con&s;ider how the ca&s;e &s;tands between them and their Maker, what knowledge they have of God, and what tru&s;t they have put in him, that &s;o they may be per&s;uaded and prepared to come within the pale of this church. But you mu&s;t fir&s;t come out of the world, el&s;e you can never come into that church that is in God; if you be in the world, you mu&s;t go to the world's church, and be the members of the world's church; and you &s;hall have this for your pains, the world will love you; but if you come out of the world's church into God's church, the world cannot love you.</P>
<P>Be as good as thou wilt, thou can&s;t never be &s;o good as Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and they loved him not, becau&s;e he was not of the world; <HI>if you were of this world,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>the world would love its own; but &s;ince you are not of the world, I have taken you out of it, therefore the world hates you; if they do &s;o to the green-tree, what will they do to the branches? are you better than I?</HI> &s;aith our Saviour; <HI>the &s;ervant is not greater than his Lord:</HI> Tho&s;e that are the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t mu&s;t be content to <HI>be per&s;ecuted, reviled and hated for his name's &s;ake;</HI> for thus they treated him

who <HI>was holy, and harmle&s;s, and undefiled,</HI> who gave them a good example, and who did them no hurt, but did them good; yet the world hated him, and it is but rea&s;onable to expect that you &s;hould &s;uffer from the world in the &s;ame manner, and bear it at their hands.</P>
<P>If you come to this church that is in God the Father, <HI>and Je&s;us the Mediator, the church of the fir&s;t-born that are written in Heaven,</HI> and come out of the world's church, then the world will be about your ears; all the world will &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t this church, again&s;t the woman that &s;hall bring forth a birth, that &s;hall rule over the na|tions: <HI>There appeared a great wonder in Heaven, a woman cloathed with the &s;un, and the moon under her feet, and up|on her head a crown of twelve &s;tars, and &s;he being with child cried, travelling in birth, and pained to be delivered. And there al&s;o appeared another wonder in heaven</HI> (a terrible thing) <HI>and behold a great read dragon, having &s;even heads and ten horns; and the dragon &s;tood before the woman that was ready to be delivered, to devour her child as &s;oon as it was born: And &s;he brought forth a man child, that was to rule all nations with a rod of iron, and her child was caught up to God, and to his throne.</HI> When the dra|gon was ready to devour this birth, God took it into his own care, in &s;pite of the devil and all his in&s;truments, and he will &s;ave the child and pre&s;erve the woman; <HI>he that &s;its in Heaven will laugh</HI> at his enemies and defeat them. There is a place appointed for the woman in the wilderne&s;s, where &s;he is pre&s;erved by the Almighty Pow|er; where &s;he is nouri&s;hed for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the &s;erpent; but &s;he mu&s;t come out again after &s;ome time, in &s;pite of the devil and all his in&s;truments, of all his dragons and &s;erpents: The woman mu&s;t come out of the wilderne&s;s, and the man-child mu&s;t come down with great power, to rule the nation.</P>
<P>This hath been accompli&s;hed, &s;ay &s;ome, above fourteen hundred years ago; and if you will take their word, the church hath been come &s;o long out of the wilderne&s;s. But the church that they &s;peak of, hath it not wanted holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s? Hath it given <HI>glory to God on high,</HI> with <HI>peace on earth and good will to men?</HI> No,

their church hath lived in tyranny and barbarous cruelty, and &s;hedding of blood. They &s;ay the church was in the wilderne&s;s in <HI>Diocle&s;ian</HI>'s time, and when <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> came to the empire then &s;he came out of the wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>If it had been a holy church, we &s;hould have &s;een the man-child come down from God, and holine&s;s and righ|teou&s;ne&s;s would have <HI>run down like a mighty &s;tream,</HI> and truth would have filled the whole earth. All the&s;e things have not yet been fulfilled, for we have &s;een the pro|fe&s;&s;ors of truth fallen in the &s;treets; they have been per|&s;ecuted and troubled, and thrown into pri&s;ons and dunge|ons; but there is a better church &s;omewhere to be found.</P>
<P>I read of the holy church, the lamb's wife, the &s;pou&s;e of Chri&s;t that hath been hid &s;omewhere, a great while, in &s;ome corner or other in the wilderne&s;s; but &s;he will come forth again out of the <HI>wilderne&s;s, leaning upon her well-beloved:</HI> She doth not come leaning on this prince and the other potentate: She comes not out of the wilderne&s;s leaning on captains, generals and armies, but leaning on Chri&s;t her well-beloved, the immortal, invi&s;ible power of the Son of God; &s;he tru&s;teth in it.</P>
<P>All the other churches, I have read of, they have leaned upon one prince or potentate, or one emperor or another, and they have relied on the&s;e great men as on their bul|wark; but this church that comes out of the wilderne&s;s, will come leaning only upon her well-beloved, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is the author and fini&s;her of her faith; &s;he will put her tru&s;t in him, for he will deliver his church from all her enemies: And though the &s;erpent ca&s;t out of his mouth water as a flood, after the woman, that he might cau&s;e her to be carried away of the flood, yet the Lord will cau&s;e the earth to help the woman, and the earth &s;hall open her mouth and &s;wallow up the flood which the dragon ca&s;t out of his mouth. Let the dragon do what he can to de&s;troy the woman and her &s;eed, &s;he knows what her beloved can do, he will command the earth to open and &s;wallow up the flood, and &s;he &s;hall go dry through it.</P>
<P>How happy are they that lean upon Chri&s;t their well-beloved! The church of Chri&s;t in all ages hath leaned up|on him, and he hath founded his church upon a rock, &s;o

<HEAD>SERMON XXVII. GOD'S WONDERFUL LOVE <HI>to</HI> MANKIND.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Preached at St. MARTIN'S-LE-GRAND, <DATE>November 9, 1690.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>IT is our great concern, while we are in this world, to promote the glory of God, and to <HI>work out our own &s;alvation,</HI> to endeavour, as much as in us lies, to be &s;en|&s;ible, and to help one another to be &s;en&s;ible of the love of God to us: This is the only thing that can give us true comfort, to have a &s;en&s;e of the love of God to us in Chri&s;t
<PB N="317" REF="020309_0317_0FAEF8694737CB28">
Je&s;us: There is nothing more certain than that all of us are partakers of the love of God, which is imparted to us daily, and we live not a day without it; but we may, if we have not a care, live many days without it, and without the comfortable &s;en&s;e of it; and that is the rea&s;on, that a great many of the &s;ons and daughters of men, do &s;hew forth in their lives, &s;o little love to God, becau&s;e they have &s;o little &s;en&s;e of his love to them; for the apo&s;tle <HI>John,</HI> that had attained to a great knowledge and experience in Chri&s;|tianity, plainly declareth, that the rea&s;on of that love that we have to God is, <HI>becau&s;e he fir&s;t loved us;</HI> and I do not believe that any man can have any true love to God, that is not &s;en&s;ible of the love of God to him.</P>
<P>And as for tho&s;e temporal ble&s;&s;ings that we enjoy in this life, as health and &s;trength, and our very breath and being, and well-being, that every day and hour are con|tinued, they are from the love of God to us, and the lengthening out of our lives and vouch&s;afing us opportuni|ties for the good of our &s;ouls, are evident tokens of God's love and good-will to us. Where the&s;e things are not con|&s;idered and regarded, men live <HI>like the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h,</HI> and regard not him that made them, but go on in di&s;obe|dience to him, and di&s;honouring of his great name, and heaping up wrath upon their own &s;ouls: And thus doth every man, while he remains in his natural &s;tate and con|dition; for there is in every man by nature the &s;eed and root of all &s;in and rebellion again&s;t God, which makes him return evil to God for the good he doth to us.</P>
<P>And I believe we are all of us &s;en&s;ible, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, of the depravity that is fallen upon all mankind, and of that enmity to God, and that aver&s;ion that is in men to the doing the will of God, and that impoten|cy and inability that is in every man to the reforming of his ways, and the changing of his heart, and leaving off his corrupt and vicious inclinations, without the di|vine help and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the grace and Spirit of God.</P>
<P>Now they that are thus far &s;en&s;ible of their alienation, by nature, from the Lord, and are al&s;o &s;en&s;ible, that the time they have here, is the only time they have for their preparation and being fitted for that everla&s;ting kingdom,
<PB N="318" REF="020309_0318_0FAEF86A56B09800">
which we all would enjoy; how ought this to affect the mind of every one, that while they have time, they might prize it and improve it, and come to an inward &s;en&s;e of the love of God, that &s;o they might have a love rai&s;ed in their hearts again to God? For people will never be obe|dient unto God, till they love him, nor ever love him, till they are &s;en&s;ible of his love to them.</P>
<P>Therefore, that which is the means and way of God's making him&s;elf known to the &s;ons and daughters of men, that means, and that way, every one ought to embrace; every one ought to be acquainted with it, and have the exerci&s;e of their minds in it, that &s;o we might come to the knowledge of God, and might know, by an experi|mental and &s;en&s;ible feeling, the kindne&s;s of God to us.</P>
<P>And truly friends, they that are minded to &s;pend their time, and exerci&s;e them&s;elves, in the con&s;ideration of the mercy and kindne&s;s of God, they have work enough for their whole life-time, to con&s;ider and contemplate the ma|nifold mercies of God be&s;towed upon them; for we have our life and breath from him, whom the whole world obeys, and &s;erves; God, that made all living creatures, hath created us, and pre&s;erved us; he hath had long-&s;uf|fering and patience towards us until now, and he is yet mindful to do us good, which is evidently manife&s;t by the invitations and promi&s;es he hath made us, and the work|ings of his Holy Spirit that he hath made us acquainted withal.</P>
<P>For who is there in this a&s;&s;embly, that God hath not made &s;en&s;ible of the tenders of his grace, and invitations to repentance and reformation, that they that live loo&s;ely and vainly in the world, might turn to the Lord with all their hearts, and con&s;ider their ways and doings? God <HI>hath waited to be gracious</HI> to the &s;ons and daughters of men, and his mercy and patience hath been beyond all human patience, beyond the patience that ever you did be&s;tow upon any, this the Lord hath be&s;towed upon you; therefore I entreat you, in the love of God, let this con&s;ideration &s;ink deeply into your &s;pirits, that you may be affected with the kind|ne&s;s of God, and his <HI>patience towards you,</HI> and his <HI>long-&s;uffering,</HI> while you have been &s;inning again&s;t him.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="020309_0319_0FAEF86A8DB88708">But &s;ome will &s;ay, how &s;hall I know this? After what manner may I experience this love of God to me? How may I be &s;ure that the Lord hath a love for me?</P>
<P>My friends, it is not only temporal kindne&s;s that we enjoy from God; it is not only the lengthening out of our days, that is an evident token of the love of God to us; but there is a demon&s;tration and manife&s;tation of it, that is univer&s;ally extended to the &s;ons and daughters of men, in that he hath &s;own his word in them, and hath &s;own his truth and his grace in their hearts, that every man, tho' he may be ever &s;o wicked, ever &s;o fooli&s;h and vain, yet he hath many times checks and reproofs in his own heart: I know it, and I doubt not but you do.</P>
<P>Pray whence comes that principle which doth &s;top you in a cour&s;e of &s;in, and check and reprove you for &s;inning again&s;t the Lord? If you attend to it, and con&s;ider it, you will find it proceeds from God; it comes from him, from him comes our life and breath; then people &s;hould be incited to receive the grace of God; the favour and mercy of God which he hath be&s;towed upon them, in order to their &s;alvation. The &s;cripture tells us, that <HI>grace and truth came by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> If thou ha&s;t any good, it came by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and if thou ha&s;t any truth, it came by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is the fountain of truth, and the foun|tain of the grace of God; it is he by whom God hath made him&s;elf known to the &s;ons and daughters of men; it is Chri&s;t alone, that <HI>God hath ordained to be a Medi|ator between God and man, that &s;o he might be the mini&s;ter of an everla&s;ting covenant,</HI> which we are brought into with God; &s;o that now people &s;hould come to the con&s;ide|ration of the way and means that God hath ordained for their redemption, namely, that he hath given Je&s;us, that great and un&s;peakable gift of his love and kindne&s;s, to the &s;ons and daughters of men; here is <HI>grace and truth,</HI> that came by Je&s;us Chri&s;t: How is it come? It is come into my heart. Tho' &s;in, and lu&s;ts and corruptions, per|haps, have a place in many, yet Chri&s;t hath a place too&punc; <HI>he hath made his grave with the wicked, and was numbered with the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors;</HI> he was like the &s;eed that lies un|der the clods, and is the lea&s;t of all &s;eeds, yet when it
<PB N="320" REF="020309_0320_0FAEF86B50857248">
comes out of the ground, it ri&s;eth high, and &s;preads abroad its branches, and brings forth fruit; this love of God, this unchangeable holy truth, is in every one; why then &s;hould not every man be ruled and governed by it?</P>
<P>But &s;ome men will &s;ay, is truth better than fal&s;hood, and grace better than lu&s;t and corruption?</P>
<P>You may &s;ee that, by the light that is di&s;covered in the inward parts: Let every man turn inward to the grace of God, turn to that light that &s;hews it&s;elf in the crea|ture, and &s;ee what it will do for us: This is the doctrine that the apo&s;tle was &s;ent withal; he was &s;ent with a com|mi&s;&s;ion <HI>to turn men from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of &s;atan to God:</HI> Why did he do it? It was for this end, that men <HI>might have remi&s;&s;ion of &s;in, and that they might come to an inheritance among them that are &s;anc|tified by faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord;</HI> &s;o that this go&s;pel is the &s;ame that it ever was, though men have divers ways of preaching, and &s;everal methods and ways of declaring the truths of the go&s;pel; ble&s;&s;ed be God the apo&s;tolical doctrine is preached again, and the ble&s;&s;ed go&s;pel hath the &s;ame power attending it that was in former days, and may have the &s;ame effect; and that this may be the portion of every one of you, is the end of our labour. And we have in our eye but two things.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, to di&s;charge a good con&s;cience in the &s;ight of God, who hath given us his word to preach, and <HI>to turn men from darkne&s;s to lights and from the power of &s;atan to God;</HI> that we might keep our&s;elves free from the blood of all men.</P>
<P>Secondly, another end is, the de&s;ire that God hath plac|ed in our hearts, <HI>that all men every where might be &s;aved;</HI> this is God's will; if any be damned it is their own will, and the devil's will; this is God's will, <HI>that none &s;hould peri&s;h, but that all &s;hould come to repentance</HI> and be eter|nally &s;aved. Now in this work of your &s;alvation, we would have regard to him that &s;ent us to preach the ever|la&s;ting go&s;pel, and we would di&s;charge our&s;elves faith|fully, and <HI>be made manife&s;t in your con&s;ciences,</HI> that the benefits of the go&s;pel might come to be yours; that you might an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of God, in &s;ending Chri&s;t to be
<PB N="321" REF="020309_0321_0FAEF86C1346B528">
the Saviour of mankind; you mu&s;t turn from &s;in to God, and then you will find the ble&s;&s;ing that comes by Je&s;us, which is <HI>to turn every one from his evil ways.</HI></P>
<P>You may read this in a book, and you may al&s;o plain|ly read it in your hearts: The Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath given you light to di&s;tingui&s;h between good and evil; if you do good, you may make a comfortable reflection up|on your&s;elves, and this will be your rejoicing, <HI>the te&s;ti|mony of your con&s;cience</HI> on that account; but if you do evil, though all men do ju&s;tify you and commend you, yet you will be condemned in your&s;elves; &s;o that you have that in your&s;elves which di&s;tingui&s;heth between things that differ in their nature and kind, and you have a little enlightening by the knowledge and under&s;tanding you have received concerning the things that are plea&s;ing and di&s;|plea&s;ing to God; if after you know this, you will go on in a way di&s;plea&s;ing to God, he will at length be too hard for you, and plunge you down into the aby&s;s of his wrath to all eternity.</P>
<P>After per&s;ons are &s;atisfied and enlightened with the light of Chri&s;t, and come to the experience of things in them|&s;elves, they will love the light and walk in the light; but there are many in this age that have read the &s;crip|tures plentifully, and yet &s;till go on in a way of &s;in, they cannot love the light that reproves them; <HI>he that doth evil he hates the light, and the dawning of the day is as the &s;hadow of death to him,</HI> and it brings nothing but con|demnation upon &s;uch per&s;ons, &s;o that they do not love the light, though it is evident they have it and enjoy it; and it &s;hall be their condemnation whether they will or no; if they do not love the light and embrace it, it will never be to their &s;alvation.</P>
<P>God hath given Chri&s;t <HI>to be a light to the Gentiles, and his &s;alvation to the ends of the earth. He is the light that enlightens every man that comes into the world;</HI> the apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> tells you the genealogy of the word of God; <HI>in the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God; and the &s;ame was in the beginning with God; all things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made; in him was life,
<PB N="322" REF="020309_0322_0FAEF86CCE05FF10">
and the life was the light of men;</HI> the life of the eternal word was the light of men; what men do you mean? I an&s;wer, <HI>he is the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</HI> He extendeth his light to every man, but it is condemnation to every man &s;o long as he continues to be a &s;inner again&s;t God: <HI>This is the condem|nation, that light is come into the world, and men love dark|ne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e their deeds are evil.</HI></P>
<P>Now all men are by nature dead in &s;ins and tre&s;pa&s;&s;es; after our fir&s;t parents fell into &s;in they were dead to God; <HI>in the day that thou eate&s;t thereof thou &s;halt die;</HI> when they had eaten the forbidden fruit, they did not die as to outward appearance, but they died as to that communion they had with their Maker; in this dead &s;tate lie all the &s;ons and daughters of Adam; but, as our Saviour &s;peaks, <HI>though they be dead, they &s;hall live again; Chri&s;t is the Lord from Heaven, a quickening Spirit;</HI> this is the ob|ject of our faith that hath been extended and offered to mankind ever &s;ince the fall; <HI>there is no name under Heaven,</HI> no other power or &s;pirit <HI>by which a man can be &s;aved;</HI> this great Mediator, the eternal Son of God, is <HI>the light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world:</HI> Faith in Chri&s;t is the &s;ame that ever it was, notwith&s;tanding the many forms of wor&s;hip among the &s;ons of men; &s;ome of God's &s;etting up, and &s;ome of men's &s;etting up; yet among all the&s;e, the object of faith is the &s;ame, and &s;aith the &s;ame.</P>
<P>In the 11th chapter of the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> that little book of martyrs, the apo&s;tle there gives you a catalogue of the mighty things that have been done by the faith of God's people; he begins with <HI>Abel; by faith Abel offered a more excellent &s;acrifice than</HI> Cain, <HI>by which he obtained witne&s;s that he was righteous, God te&s;tifying of his gifts; and by it, he being dead, yet &s;peaketh; by faith</HI> Enoch <HI>was tran&s;lated that he &s;hould not &s;ee death, and was not found, becau&s;e God tran&s;lated him, for before his tran&s;lation, he had this te&s;timony, that he plea&s;ed God;</HI> and &s;o the apo&s;tle there goes to <HI>Noah, Abraham, I&s;aac, Jacob, Jo&s;eph</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;es: And what &s;hall I &s;ay more,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>for the time would fail me to tell of</HI> Gideon, <HI>and of</HI> Barak, <HI>and of</HI> Samp&s;on, <HI>and</HI> Jeptha, <HI>of</HI> David, Samuel, <HI>and of the prophets, who
<PB N="323" REF="020309_0323_0FAEF86D929C38A0">
through faith &s;ubdued kingdoms, wrought righteou&s;ne&s;s, obtained promi&s;es, &s;topped the mouths of lions, and quenched the violence of fire, e&s;caped the edge of the &s;word, out of weakne&s;s were made &s;trong, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.</HI> All the&s;e great and noble things were done by faith; it was the a&s;pect their &s;ouls had upon Chri&s;t the Mediator between God and man; it was their tru&s;t and reliance upon God through Chri&s;t the Mediator that did &s;upport and uphold them in all they did and &s;uffered. This faith is &s;till the &s;ame.</P>
<P>There are many faiths in the world be&s;ide, but they will prove but the faith of hypocrites. Some have a faith, that if they do this and the other work, they &s;ay you may tru&s;t your &s;ouls upon the&s;e good works; but this is not the faith of <HI>Abraham,</HI> the father of the faithful. But &s;ome called Chri&s;tians are gone &s;o far in the doctrine of me|rits, that they think they can do enough for their own &s;alvation, and for their friends and relations too; that there may be more merit &s;till over and above, that others may have benefit by the merit of their works of &s;upereroga|tion: But this is not the faith of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and other &s;aints, by which they wrought &s;uch wonders in the world. I would not have men tru&s;t at all in their own works for &s;alvation, but tru&s;t in Chri&s;t alone, who <HI>is able to &s;ave, to the uttermo&s;t, all that come to God by him.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;ome will object that we are taught the doctrine of faith in Chri&s;t, and ju&s;tification by him.</P>
<P>Well, for my part, my tongue &s;hall as &s;oon drop out of my mouth, as oppo&s;e the doctrine of being ju&s;tified by faith in Chri&s;t. But, let me tell you, this may be mi&s;|applied: If a man believe that he is ju&s;tified by faith in Chri&s;t, and yet knows, in his own con&s;cience, that he is condemned, he believeth a lie; he is &s;educed and de|ceived. A man cannot be ju&s;tified by Chri&s;t, when the Spirit of Chri&s;t condemneth him: Such a one, when he comes to lay down his head upon his dying pillow, all his faith will fly away. I have met with &s;ome in&s;tances, lamentable in&s;tances, of tho&s;e that were called Chri&s;tians, that have made a profe&s;&s;ion of religion, and at la&s;t have laid down their heads in &s;orrow. If this be your mi&s;|take,

con&s;ider, while you have time, that you may die in peace.</P>
<P>Now the propo&s;ition and tender of the love of God to mankind, hath always carried that limitation with it, that every one in the world ought to ob&s;erve; if a man hope to be &s;aved by Chri&s;t, he mu&s;t be ruled by him: It is contrary to all manner of rea&s;on, that the devil &s;hould rule a man, and Chri&s;t be his Saviour: The whole tenor of the New Te&s;tament is again&s;t it (pray read it as oft as you plea&s;e, for it is a good exerci&s;e) you will find the true Chri&s;tian's faith to be this, that he that hath faith in Chri&s;t hath an operation upon him for the clean|&s;ing his heart, and purifying and purging his <HI>con&s;cience from dead works, that he may &s;erve the living God;</HI> though he hath been a &s;ervant of the devil, it will make him leave his former &s;ervitude, and bring him under the influence of another law, <HI>the law of the &s;pirit of life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, which will make him free from the law of &s;in and death.</HI> The apo&s;tle &s;ets down the &s;everal conditions he had pa&s;&s;ed through; <HI>I was alive without the law once;</HI> he thought him|&s;elf a man, a brave man, a man of under&s;tanding, that had profited among the Jews; I was alive, having re&s;pect to that law which &s;hould have been my governor; <HI>but when the commandment came, &s;in revived and I died.</HI> He had read the law, the commandment, many times, and had been at the reading of it in the <HI>&s;ynagogue;</HI> but there was a comming of the commandment which he had not been acquainted with; there was a writing of the law of God in his heart; when he came to this inward work upon him, where was then the life he lived? <HI>When the command|ment came &s;in revived, and I died:</HI> There was a profe&s;|&s;ing life he formerly lived, but he was &s;lain by the power of the commandment, it laid him in the du&s;t as a &s;lain man; when he was in a &s;lain condition he found out that law in him that was the law of &s;in and death, and this cau&s;ed a combat and a war in him; <HI>I find a law,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>that when I would do good, evil is pre&s;ent with me; for I de|light in the law of God in the inner man; but I &s;ee an|other law in my members warring again&s;t the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of &s;in,
<PB N="325" REF="020309_0325_0FAEF8718C14A6C0">
which is in my members:</HI> Now this brought him to a pover|ty of &s;pirit, into a &s;en&s;e of his mi&s;erable condition, and then he cries out, <HI>O wretched man that I am, who &s;hall deliver me from this body of death!</HI></P>
<P>Now &s;ome people in this day, they are like the apo&s;tle, they have a <HI>law in their members warring again&s;t the law of their minds; the good that they would do they do not,</HI> and they can go no further: But the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> did reach further, though he did not in that &s;tate know deliverance, yet he had a faith that he &s;hould be delivered, and that he &s;hould not be mi&s;erable all his days. Thus having led the <HI>Romans</HI> into the &s;everal &s;tates through which he pa&s;&s;ed, he brings them to a further &s;tate, <HI>the law of the &s;pirit of life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us hath made me free from the law of &s;in and death: And now there is no condemnation to them that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> How &s;hall we know this? <HI>They walk not after the fle&s;h, but after the &s;pirit.</HI> Now <HI>Paul</HI> was come to that &s;anctified &s;tate, that &s;tate of free|dom and liberty which Chri&s;t Je&s;us will bring all tho&s;e unto that believe in him.</P>
<P>Holy men, in former days, did experience and find a great &s;trife and warfare in their own hearts, they would all do well, and <HI>exerci&s;e a con&s;cience, void of offence, to|wards God and towards man;</HI> but there is a law of &s;in that wars in their members; if we yield to it it leads to &s;in and death; but if we yield our&s;elves to the <HI>law of the &s;pirit of life,</HI> there is a power that is derived from the Mediator, that will tran&s;late the &s;oul <HI>out of the king|dom of darkne&s;s</HI> and &s;in, which the devil is the prince of, <HI>and bring it into the kingdom of God's dear Son.</HI></P>
<P>There mu&s;t be a real change wrought in us before we can come to God, and to fellow&s;hip and communion with God, which alone can make the &s;oul happy. Let this be the exerci&s;e of every one of us to adore and magnify the great mercy and the kindne&s;s of God, that he hath not withdrawn his &s;pirit from you, but hath placed a monitor in your bo&s;oms that calls upon you to <HI>cea&s;e to do evil, and learn to do well,</HI> and to con&s;ider that <HI>the wages of &s;in is death:</HI> Here is a &s;in, I may commit it; there is a temptation before me, but I know there is a bait and
<PB N="326" REF="020309_0326_0FAEF872A6F38EC0">
a hook; I may &s;wallow it if I will, but if I do, it will be my ruin: Would I come to eternal death, and have my portion with liars and wicked per&s;ons in the kingdom of darkne&s;s, <HI>where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched?</HI> Or would I have my portion with &s;aints and angels? If I would have my portion with the ble&s;&s;ed in the kingdom of God when I die, I mu&s;t walk in the way that leads to it; but the <HI>gate is &s;trait and the way nar|row, and few there be that find it;</HI> labour then to be one of tho&s;e few.</P>
<P>But what &s;ignifies our labour (&s;ome may &s;ay) if we can <HI>do nothing that is good, not &s;o much as think a good thought?</HI> What &s;ignifies our labour? All the labours and endeavours in the whole world cannot make a man happy.</P>
<P>I now &s;peak to a people to whom God doth vouch|&s;afe the help and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his grace and Spirit, and the vi&s;itations of his love and power; you mu&s;t now endea|vour to do &s;omething; if a man endeavour, with the help of God he may do a great deal of good, and &s;hun a great deal of evil: Though all our endeavours, in our own power and &s;trength can &s;ignify nothing, yet they are required by God, and by joining them with his grace, and laying hold of opportunities, by divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, we may do what God will accept. But if a man do any thing in his own power and &s;trength, whether prayer, hear|ing, reading, meditation, or any other duty, he had as good let it alone.</P>
<P>I would con&s;ider you as tho&s;e that God hath followed with his grace and the manife&s;tation of his &s;pirit; this is given to every man <HI>to profit withal,</HI> and every man hath opportunity to work with it; but he mu&s;t <HI>work while it is day, for the night cometh when no man can work.</HI></P>
<P>Let every one of us that are now met together, labour to be &s;en&s;ible of the love of God to us, and love him above all, and expre&s;s our love by a willing and per&s;evering obedience, that we may have the <HI>love of God &s;hed abroad upon our hearts by the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> and offer up living prai&s;es to him through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>who hath loved us, and wa&s;hed us from our &s;ins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and prie&s;ts unto God and his Father: To him be glory and dominion forever and ever.</HI> Amen.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON XXVIII. SALVATION <HI>from</HI> SIN <HI>by</HI> JESUS CHRIST.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Preached at DEVONSHIRE-HOUSE, <DATE>Augu&s;t 9, 1691.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>IT is a general doctrine in the world, that no man by any means can ever be &s;et free from &s;in in this life: This is univer&s;ally received among almo&s;t all Chri&s;tians, in all churches; and though they differ ever &s;o much in other things, yet they agree in this; &s;o that this doctrine hath got a &s;way in the world, and it is accounted a great delu&s;ion and a here&s;y, and a grand error for any to que&s;tion the truth of it.</P>
<P>Now while a man is of that belief, that there is an im|po&s;&s;ibility of living without &s;in, and of breaking down the kingdom of &s;atan in any one &s;oul in the world, how can men hope or believe that righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hould prevail in the heart of one man? There is neither king nor beggar, nor bi&s;hop nor a go&s;pel mini&s;ter, but the devil mu&s;t have a rule and government in him, &s;o long as he lives in the world. As long as this is believed, it is not po&s;&s;ible that the other belief &s;hould take place; it is madne&s;s to think that I mu&s;t be under the rule and government of &s;atan if I am under the government of the Son of God. And it is &s;till greater madne&s;s to &s;ay, that Chri&s;t and the devil are both my governors and rulers: It is prodigious folly and madne&s;s to &s;peak after this manner.</P>
<P>This belief prevails over all men; over the wi&s;e, and mighty, and noble, and learned, that they can never be freed from the power of &s;in in this world, but that the devil will lead them into &s;in every day; let men be ever &s;o &s;ober, ever &s;o ab&s;temious in their lives; let them &s;pend ever &s;o many hours in prayer every day; let them come to meetings and hear &s;ermons, and write them, and re|peat them, and do what they will, here is a bar of un|belief that lies in the way, that makes men <HI>depart from the living God,</HI> and his power, and lo&s;e the benefit they &s;hall receive from Chri&s;t: And therefore they go to ob|tain
<PB N="328" REF="020309_0328_0FAEF87460A5C9C0">
it another way, that is, to have the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t imputed to them, and they &s;hall be pure and holy in the &s;ight of God, when they are polluted in their own eyes; and when they &s;ee their daily failings, infirmities and corruptions, yet God may not &s;ee them; but that he &s;ees them holy, ju&s;t and righteous in his Son.</P>
<P>What &s;trange kind of doctrine is this? I mu&s;t pre&s;ume that God will &s;ee me in his Son, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, when I never was in Chri&s;t: How can this be? <HI>He that is in Chri&s;t, is a new creature; old things are done away, and all things are become new:</HI> But if there be old things re|maining &s;till, and I am not become new, &s;hall I pre&s;ume that I am in Chri&s;t, and that God will &s;ee me in his Son? When people come to u&s;e the under&s;tanding that God hath given them, they will look upon them&s;elves as barred out by their unbelief, that the nations have drunk in; and it is as &s;weet to them as the honey and the ho|ney-comb.</P>
<P>But, ble&s;&s;ed be God, many have vomited it up already; If they would have placed this doctrine upon man's na|tural ability, I would have &s;aid <HI>Amen</HI> to it. I know there is none of us all have a natural ability and power to de|liver his own &s;oul from &s;in and &s;atan; but when they come to place it upon God, that though the <HI>Lord make bare his arm, and reveal his power;</HI> though they come to have the grace of God, that &s;till they could not be de|livered from &s;in, this hath bla&s;phemy at the bottom of it. The other reflected upon man's power; this reflects upon the power of God Almighty: That the devil hath got &s;uch a power over us, that God hath not power over us, nor can have power and dominion over us, &s;o that of a whole nation he cannot have one man to &s;erve him.</P>
<P>Much might be &s;aid in an&s;wer to this: When men are once willing to &s;erve God, they will be willing to leave the &s;ervice of the devil. There is no way to an&s;wer that good wi&s;h, but by wating upon God for the revealing of his power: I pray God that when you come to a meeting, you may &s;ay, Lord, let thy power go forth upon my heart; let thy arm be made bare, and deliver me from the power and dominion of &s;in. Some will &s;ay they feel God's
<PB N="329" REF="020309_0329_0FAEF8751C8456B8">
power in a meeting; I feel the power of God working upon my heart, in order to the taking away &s;in and tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, and giving me victory over it, through the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. If they feel this power of God upon them, it is their duty to believe it and depend upon it: If I be|lieve it, I mu&s;t wait for the dictates of it, and believe that I &s;hall be able to do <HI>all things through Chri&s;t that &s;trength|ens me:</HI> Then faith will come forth into works, and ap|pear to be a living faith.</P>
<P>You may remember what the apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> &s;aith, <HI>as the body without the Spirit is dead, &s;o faith without works is dead al&s;o.</HI> As &s;oon as a man comes to join with the mighty power of God, he will be able to with&s;tand temptation: If he comes into evil company, he will deny them and not comply with them; he will find then &s;omething of a power and ability to &s;erve God; though he is not come to per|fection, yet he is walking in the way of holine&s;s, and <HI>pre&s;|&s;ing forward towards the mark of the high calling of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us:</HI> He will &s;ay, I have got a little nearer than I was towards the place where I would be, towards that life which I would live and die; then let death come when it plea&s;eth God, it &s;hall be welcome.</P>
<P>This is the wickedne&s;s of many in the world, they will not live &s;uch a life as they would be willing to die in. They cannot come at it unle&s;s it be given them to believe, for it is the gift of God; they mu&s;t come to their governor and leader, which goes before, to the gift of God, which is eternal life; then let death come when it will, if I have the gift of eternal life.</P>
<P>It is a mi&s;erable thing to think that there are many that have not laid hold of eternal life: It is manife&s;ted, that we may lay hold of it, there is a hand of faith joining with it. When a man comes to lay hold of eternal life, this life will purify him and &s;anctify him, at lea&s;t by degrees, till he be wholly &s;anctified in body, &s;oul and &s;pirit: This is that which the apo&s;tle writes in one of his epi&s;tles, <HI>your &s;alvation is nearer than when you at fir&s;t believed.</HI> When they fir&s;t believed, their &s;alvation was a pretty way off. He de|&s;cribes &s;alvation to be the end of their faith and hope.</P>
<P>When a man comes to be delivered from his &s;ins, he &s;hall &s;erve God without fear; but when a man comes to
<PB N="330" REF="020309_0330_0FAEF875D38E8BC8">
live by faith, he &s;hall overcome; he is a good &s;oldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and he mu&s;t fight valiantly under his banner, till he gets a victory over all his enemies, and then his &s;al|vation is much nearer than when he at fir&s;t believed.</P>
<P>I would I could &s;ay &s;o of &s;ome of you; for I fear your &s;alvation is farther off: Some go &s;traggling here and there, as &s;heep not having a &s;hepherd; this is that which my &s;pirit is exerci&s;ed with. You that are travellers to|wards the kingdom of God, it is the wonderful grace and mercy of God, that ever it &s;hould come into your minds to &s;eek the kingdom of God, and the righteou&s;ne&s;s there|of. They that have obtained this mercy from God, &s;hall receive and enjoy other mercies, better mercies; <HI>ble&s;&s;ed are they that hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s:</HI> That is one mercy; but there is another mercy, they &s;hall be fil|led; they &s;hall be &s;atisfied: When a man comes to this, he mu&s;t take up a daily cro&s;s, and exerci&s;e &s;elf-denial; but if he follow Chri&s;t, he &s;hall be &s;atisfied; he &s;hall then have nothing but peace and joy; he &s;hall then &s;ing prai&s;es and glory to God in the highe&s;t, and to the Lamb for|ever.</P>
<P>There is none can under&s;tand the glory that is laid up for tho&s;e that take up their cro&s;s and follow Chri&s;t, and love his appearing. This is the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing that God doth give unto his people, <HI>he hath &s;ent his Son Je&s;us to ble&s;s us, and turn us from our iniquities.</HI> This is a ble&s;|&s;ing indeed. Take heed that you do not admit of any new terms: Do not think to bring God Almighty to new arti|cles, the terms are declared and concluded on already: If you will obtain the ble&s;&s;ing, you mu&s;t be turned every one of you from your iniquities: The terms are already made, the law of God mu&s;t be <HI>written in the heart and inward thoughts,</HI> and you mu&s;t clo&s;e with that power that will write the law in your hearts, and by travelling towards the king|dom of God, you will &s;ee the coming of that kingdom in you.</P>
<P>It was the joy of my &s;oul, that I &s;aw the kingdom of Chri&s;t would be &s;et up in my heart, before it was &s;et up there; then I &s;aw the Lord's wonderful work, and there was a great alteration in me, when the Lord was plea&s;ed to wean me
<PB N="331" REF="020309_0331_0FAEF876C8432C60">
from the world's brea&s;t, and take off my heart, and wean it from worldly lu&s;ts, from the world's joys, and plea&s;ures, and fa&s;hions, and the world's honour and reputation: I &s;ay the Lord was plea&s;ed to wean me from the&s;e things, and brought me to a holy re&s;ignation, to give up my heart to him: If I have joy, it mu&s;t be from the Holy Spirit; if I have plea&s;ure it mu&s;t be in the pre&s;ence of God, who <HI>in the multitude of my thoughts within me</HI> made his comforts <HI>de|light my &s;oul;</HI> and if he bring not comfort to you, you will never have it; you cannot expect it till you do believe; and when you have faith, you can feel the kingdom of God within you: There mu&s;t be the new birth, the work of regeneration, for <HI>except a man be born again he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God;</HI> there mu&s;t be a tran&s;lation from death to life, there mu&s;t be a turning out of the old bottom and a fixing upon a new bottom, upon <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us the rock of ages;</HI> there mu&s;t be a &s;ubjection to his holy power and government, el&s;e you cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God.</P>
<P>Many have gone on in a profe&s;&s;ion many years, and never &s;aw the beauty of it; and every little trifle in the world hath diverted them, and drawn them away. This and the other plea&s;ure hath drawn away their hearts, they have &s;een the glory of the world, which hath captivated them: But tho&s;e that make a profe&s;&s;ion of the truth, and have &s;een the beauty and glory of the kingdom of Chri&s;t, they &s;hould, be &s;hy of returning to the world again, for the apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>it happened to them according to the true pro|verb, the dog is turned to his own vomit again, and the &s;ow that was wa&s;hed to her wallowing in the mire; it had been better for them never to have known the way of righteou&s;ne&s;s, than af|ter they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them:</HI> They made a profe&s;&s;ion, and were mem|bers of a vi&s;ible church, and had a name to live, but they were inwardly dead, the &s;ight of the kingdom of God is not given to &s;uch, but unto babes, that have a divine birth, and <HI>that de&s;ire the &s;incere milk of the word, that they may grow thereby. God hath hid the&s;e things from the wi&s;e and prudent, and revealed them unto babes.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;peak to tho&s;e who are here this day, that would receive &s;ome kindne&s;s from God, and that de&s;ire the know|ledge
<PB N="332" REF="020309_0332_0FAEF8775D036610">
of his ways, and that the my&s;teries of his kingdom may be revealed to you, let your minds be retired and you &s;hall find the great things belonging to your peace made known to you. We have &s;poken much of this, but I would not have you know it only by our &s;ayings, I would have you go into your&s;elves, to &s;ee whether God hath not be&s;towed this grace and ble&s;&s;ing upon you: If God hath given you grace, do not <HI>turn it into wanton|ne&s;s;</HI> do not abu&s;e the grace of God. What is it that you do when the grace of God hath convinced you, that &s;uch and &s;uch a thing is &s;in, and if you do it, it will turn to your ruin? Dare you venture to commit &s;in af|ter you are convinced of it? O take heed of doing <HI>de&s;|pite to the &s;pirit of grace,</HI> and of <HI>grieving the Holy Spi|rit, whereby you are &s;ealed to the day of redemption.</HI></P>
<P>I wi&s;h that the weight of this con&s;ideration might lie upon you, and that a holy dread and awe of God might be wrought in your hearts, that you might be kept from &s;inning again&s;t God. You know there is a general out|cry again&s;t pre&s;umptuous &s;inning, &s;inning again&s;t light: Why &s;hould not we all cry out again&s;t it? It is a mo&s;t dread|ful thing for any man to &s;in again&s;t his knowledge and conviction; if any of us have been guilty of &s;inning agan&s;t light, let &s;uch a one &s;ay, I have done iniquity, I will do &s;o no more, but enter into covenant with the Lord, and &s;ay, O Lord, &s;o far as thou ha&s;t revealed thy will unto me, I will obey it; I will delight to do thy will, O God, tho' I cro&s;s mine own will. Whatever I cro&s;s I will not cro&s;s God's Holy Spirit, by which I may be &s;ealed to the day of redemption; I will never do this though I hazard my chief intere&s;t in the world: This is the tem|per of a true Chri&s;tian, and I pray God make you all of this mind.</P>
<P>And now my friends, you that de&s;ire to &s;ee this great work wrought in your&s;elves, commit the whole work to God, and trouble not your&s;elves about it. I am &s;ure God will carry on his own work, and bring down the devil's kingdom, and rebuke that unclean &s;pirit that is gone forth over the whole nation, and pour out abundantly of his Holy Spirit to carry on a glorious reformation. This I
<PB N="333" REF="020309_0333_0FAEF878F0D25638">
believe God will certainly do, from what he hath wrought in my own &s;oul. I know not what in&s;truments are to be employed in the work, I leave that to the Lord; but the kingdom of Chri&s;t &s;hall be advanced, and it &s;hall be out|wardly, and a be&s;om of de&s;truction &s;hall &s;weep away all his enemies from the earth, and the wrath of God &s;hall burn again&s;t them; but there is an obduration hath been upon the nations of the world, and &s;omething hath &s;tood in the way in all generations.</P>
<P>But, however, I am &s;ure we all may well &s;ay, that Chri&s;t is the <HI>Saviour of all men, but e&s;pecially of them that believe.</HI> He hath &s;aved this city and nation from the plagues and vengeance that hang over us. Many years the Lord hath &s;pared us, and waited to be gracious for a long time, to &s;ee if we will at la&s;t turn to him. How long the Mediator will intercede on our behalf, we can|not tell; there is a time when the long-&s;uffering of God will come to an end, God hath brought a &s;courge up|on the nations round about us, and the flames of his wrath hath kindled upon them, and de&s;truction hath over|taken them; how &s;oon it may be our lot, we know not; all our money, our &s;ilver and gold, and valour and cou|rage, will not be able to ward it off, if the Lord but blow upon us. It is even at the door; there is but one way to &s;ave us, and that is turning to the Lord, and crying to the Lord for the continuance of his mercies and long-&s;uffering, and patience towards us. In this cry to the Lord, let us all unite, that are lovers of the nation, and let us join our earne&s;t &s;upplications in this work, &s;eeing the Lord hath made us the monuments of his mercy and pre&s;erving goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>We have been continually &s;urrounded with war and blood, and flames and de&s;truction; and the cry of the or|phans hath been heard from other nations. And while they have been con&s;umed with flames, and deluged in &s;treams of blood, we have &s;at under our own vines and fig-trees; but judgments hang over the nation, and whether they will fall or not, the Lord knows: But what &s;hall we do for the good of our nation, and cities and families, but labour every one, in the fear of God, to reform our lives,
<PB N="334" REF="020309_0334_0FAEF8798D3009A0">
and to take heed that we &s;in not again&s;t the light, left we die, and peri&s;h in the middle of tho&s;e terrible judg|ments that hang over us.</P>
<P>Let us turn from our evil ways, and depart from all iniquity, that the kingdom of Chri&s;t may be &s;et up in our&s;elves. It is the righteous in the nation that the Lord looks at, and for their &s;akes he will &s;pare a nation. If there be a people among us that walk in humility, and lament and mourn for the abominations committed in the mid&s;t of us, God will have regard to them, and he will hear the cries and the &s;upplications of a praying people.</P>
<P>Friends, you that cannot make u&s;e of &s;word and &s;pear for the &s;aving of a nation, you may do good by your prayers, and turning to the Lord with an unfeigned heart, and let your &s;incerity appear before him. If I would take a common prayer-book in my hands, and pray ever &s;o devoutly and &s;olemnly, if I be not &s;incere, what will that do? Or, if I pray without a book, or if I pray without a form, or reject the form that others have made for me, what will this avail? But the <HI>cry of the poor, and the &s;ighing of the needy, and the effectual fervent prayer of the righteous, hath availed much</HI> for the &s;aving of this nation many years.</P>
<P>Therefore, I exhort you all, as you love the nation, and as you love your&s;elves, and your families and relations, &s;in not again&s;t the Lord; for he is now &s;etting up righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, equity, and ju&s;tice, and it &s;hall prevail in the na|tion. God hath been plea&s;ed to gather in many, that have been enemies, that are now turned from &s;in to God, and led by the truth: And it is their greate&s;t joy, that now they are no longer &s;ervants of &s;in, but are now become the &s;ervants of God.</P>
<P>Now truth will prevail, and righteou&s;ne&s;s go forth as the morning &s;un, and we hope the Lord will &s;hew mercy to us for the glory of his own name, though we are an un|worthy people: It will be matter of joy and gladne&s;s to us, if the kingdom of God be come; then we may &s;ay our prayer is an&s;wered. We have often prayed, <HI>thy kingdom come, and thy will be done in earth as it is in Heaven.</HI> If the will of God be done, then I can do mine own will no longer, then I can be led away by &s;atan no longer; the devil will

have little power, if I do God's will on earth, as it is done in Heaven; then prai&s;es will ari&s;e in the hearts of every one that delights to do the will of God, and God will carry on his work for the glory of his own name, and for the redemption of his people, that Chri&s;t may be <HI>preached for &s;alvation to the ends of the earth.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SERMON XXIX. <HI>The</HI> ACCEPTABLE SACRIFICE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Preached at GRACE-CHURCH-STREET, <DATE>July 3, 1692.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>ALL people that would wor&s;hip God and meet together for that purpo&s;e, they had need have a great reverence upon their minds, and a holy fear upon their &s;pirits, that when they enter into the hou&s;e of the Lord, and draw nigh to the living God, they might not <HI>offer the &s;acrifice of fools,</HI> but may of|fer to God that which may be acceptable to him. For all wor&s;hip, and all religion, and all offerings and oblati|ons that ever were offered to God by any people, they have had a return unto the offerers and wor&s;hippers, either of acceptance or rejection. Many you know have been rejected tho' they have offered, and many have been ac|cepted of God, and their offerings have been <HI>a &s;weet &s;mel|ling &s;avour in his no&s;trils;</HI> and, I hope, we are all of that mind, that we would be glad to have our wor&s;hip, and &s;ervice and offerings to God, accepted in his &s;ight, and that our pre&s;ent a&s;&s;embling together might be for the better, and that every one might have an an&s;wer of peace, and of acceptance in their bo&s;oms; but that can never be unle&s;s men be qualified and prepared in their drawing nigh to God, and in all our offerings and wor&s;hip that we perform, our hearts be prepared <HI>according to the preparation of the &s;anctuary,</HI> the preparation of God's dwelling and holy place.</P>
<P>The wor&s;hippers mu&s;t be holy; there mu&s;t be the fear of God, and a reverence of the great God upon their minds,
<PB N="336" REF="020309_0336_0FAEF87C5780B558">
before people can offer an acceptable &s;acrifice unto him, as the holy apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>Heb.</HI> xi. 6: <HI>He that cometh to God, mu&s;t believe that he is;</HI> which &s;ignifies, that a pre|paration ought to be in the minds and hearts of people that would draw nigh to God; or perform any &s;ervice or wor&s;hip to God, they mu&s;t have the knowledge of the God whom they wor&s;hip, they mu&s;t fir&s;t <HI>know that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently &s;eek him.</HI> Here is a qualification for wor&s;hippers, for religious per&s;ons; as they expect when they meet together to find the Lord in the mid&s;t of them, they mu&s;t be qualified accordingly, there mu&s;t be an awe upon their minds.</P>
<P>I am in the pre&s;ence of God, I have an expectation from God, that he will open his abounding trea&s;ury, and mi|ni&s;ter &s;ome good unto me, or el&s;e to what purpo&s;e do people draw nigh to God? It is becau&s;e they would have &s;omething of him; but they mu&s;t come in an humble pe|titioning frame; <HI>he giveth grace to the humble.</HI> It is the lofty, the proud, tho&s;e that exalt them&s;elves, the fat and the full, that want nothing. <HI>The&s;e,</HI> &s;aith the prophet, <HI>the Lord beholdeth afar off.</HI> A proud man or woman cannot draw nigh to God, the Lord looks upon them afar off; nor do they partake of tho&s;e divine and heavenly com|forts and ble&s;&s;ings, and coun&s;els and in&s;tructions that the humble mind hath the promi&s;e of and will certainly enjoy, <HI>the humble, God will teach, he will in&s;truct the meek in his way;</HI> but what is this to the lofty mind? What is this to one that is exalted, and conceited and puffed up, and reckons him&s;elf full and wanting nothing, while he is &s;wimming in the &s;treams of plea&s;ures of this world, and &s;avours only the things of the earth, the plea&s;ures of a &s;en&s;ual mind? The&s;e per&s;ons are not hungry, and &s;o they are not fed; they are not thir&s;ty, and &s;o they never ob|tain that which can &s;atisfy the &s;oul. Our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t pronounced a ble&s;&s;ing upon them that hunger and thir&s;t; but what is that to them that are full and lack nothing?</P>
<P>So my friends, in this and all other religious a&s;&s;emblies, a great care ought to be upon every one, that their com|ing together to wait upon the Lord may be in that reve|rence and fear, and that hope and expectation at the hands
<PB N="337" REF="020309_0337_0FAEF87C9CB15258">
of God, that they might be bettered by it, or el&s;e they all lo&s;e their labour, as <HI>Cain</HI> did; he would be an offer|er, he offered &s;acrifice, but was not accepted; becau&s;e his mind and heart was not right before the Lord, his &s;acrifice was rejected. It was before he had killed his brother; he had great guilt upon him, before he had killed his brother; he wanted the qualification of well-doing; <HI>if thou do&s;t well, &s;halt thou not be accepted? But if thou do&s;t not well, &s;in lies at thy door.</HI> He was got into evil doing, and an evil mind hindered his acceptance with God; &s;o it doth with all men and women in the world that meddle with religious wor&s;hip, and &s;acrifice to God, if they meddle with evil doing. There mu&s;t be a taking off the mind from the evil of &s;in and corruption, and the mind mu&s;t be brought over to &s;omething that they have received from God be|fore ever they can be accepted.</P>
<P>You know the general doctrine of all Prote&s;tants is, that we have no acceptance with God but through Je&s;us Chri&s;t; we have no way to plea&s;e God, nor can do any thing that &s;hall be acceptable in his &s;ight, but thro' one only Mediator. Now if I &s;hould go to wor&s;hip God, or per|form any religious duty without re&s;pect and deference to the &s;en&s;e and participation of the virtue and power of that only Mediator, how can I be accepted? And it hath plea|&s;ed God out of his infinite love to mankind, to &s;end this great Mediator into the world, that every man that comes into the world is made a participant of &s;omething of the life and virtue of that Mediator. So you read, <HI>John</HI> i. 4. <HI>in him was life, and the life was the light of men, the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world;</HI> and that with re&s;pect to men whether they are good or no, both good and bad, though all men are bad by nature: So that tho' they are children of wrath, and heirs of eternal damnation in their natural &s;tate, by rea|&s;on of &s;in, yet for all that this one Mediator, in whom this light hath &s;hined, hath &s;ent forth his light among the &s;ons and daughters of men, that is, the light of men, that enlightens every one. So there is an offer made of &s;ome|thing that pre&s;ents it&s;elf to the view of every man that is good; if he apply his mind to it, he may have that good
<PB N="338" REF="020309_0338_0FAEF87D547BC258">
that comes by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; he may draw nigh to God; as bad as he is, he hath &s;ome good, that God hath be&s;towed upon men good and bad. There is no man &s;uch a liar, but he hath &s;ome truth in him; there is no man &s;o ungodly, but he knows that which is pure and holy, that which hath reproved him, checked and convinced him of his ungodline&s;s. This pre&s;ents it&s;elf to the view of every man and wo|man, and calls them to repentance.</P>
<P>Now for men to make a &s;hew and pretence to wor&s;hip, and not have regard to the glory of God, how can they draw nigh to God, or God draw nigh to them? Our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>that where two or three are gathered to|gether in my name, I will be in the mid&s;t of them;</HI> but if people meet together in their &s;in and wickedne&s;s, if they have a loo&s;e and vain mind, and intend to go on in wick|edne&s;s and &s;in, if they meet, they meet not in Chri&s;t's name, but in the devil's name, and he is in the mid&s;t of them, and he works and <HI>rules in the hearts of the children of di&s;obedience.</HI> So that this hath been the ground and rea|&s;on why abundance of meetings upon this account have been fruitle&s;s as to the benefit of their &s;ouls, and the ex|pectations of people have been fru&s;trated as to their &s;alva|tion; they have not met with that in which the ble&s;&s;ing is, and to which the promi&s;e is made. The promi&s;e is not made to people that the devil rules; there is no promi&s;e to &s;uch but the promi&s;e of eternal wrath to be executed upon them, with the devil and his angels to all eternity; if you can make that a promi&s;e.</P>
<P>The promi&s;e of life and &s;alvation which is recorded by the prophets and apo&s;tles, it hath always relation to the &s;eed that are in covenant with God. In this the covenant &s;tands, &s;aith God to <HI>Abraham, Gen.</HI> xvii. 7. <HI>I will e&s;tab|li&s;h my covenant between me and thee, and thy &s;eed after thee in their generations, for an everla&s;ting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy &s;eed after thee.</HI> The cove|nant is made to <HI>Abraham</HI> and his &s;eed, that is, with Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Mediator. It is he that brings to God, tho&s;e that tru&s;t in him and come to him, <HI>he that cometh to him, he will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out;</HI> they that do not come to Chri&s;t, are ca&s;t off already. All men, by nature, are ca&s;t
<PB N="339" REF="020309_0339_0FAEF87E13447EC0">
away already; if any of them will be &s;aved, it is by com|ing to Chri&s;t, <HI>who is able to &s;ave, to the uttermo&s;t,</HI> and to make peace for them, and of twain to make one new man; and to make peace between God and the &s;oul.</P>
<P>There is a nece&s;&s;ity for all people, that have any &s;en&s;e of their natural &s;tate and condition, that according to na|ture have no title to the kingdom of God, to be recon|ciled to God. By nature they cannot make a claim to righteou&s;ne&s;s and life; they connot reconcile them&s;elves to God by all their works; &s;aith the prophet <HI>Micah, will the Lord be plea&s;ed with a thou&s;and rams, or with ten thou&s;and rivers of oil? Shall I give my fir&s;t-born for my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, the fruit of my body for the &s;in of my &s;oul? He hath &s;hewed thee, O man! what is good: And what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do ju&s;tly, and love mer|cy, and walk humbly with thy God?</HI> They that will be &s;aved, mu&s;t lay hold of &s;alvation in that way and method that the Lord God of Heaven and Earth hath pre&s;crib|ed. He hath pre&s;cribed a way for every body to be &s;av|ed; he would not have any one to peri&s;h, but that all &s;hould come to repentance, and obtain everla&s;ting life. God hath made a way that will &s;erve every body alike; thou|&s;ands as well as ten; and all the world as well as one man. Now the way that God hath made, is turning out of the &s;tate into which they are fallen, and for&s;aking that governor that rules in the hearts of the children of di&s;|obedience, and clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t, whom God hath ap|pointed to reign in every ones heart. People in Chri&s;|tendom will &s;ay, they have clo&s;ed with Chri&s;t. Do not you hope to be &s;aved by Chri&s;t, on the terms of the co|venant? It is not crying, <HI>Lord, Lord,</HI> but doing the will of God; the terms are, <HI>all men mu&s;t believe in Chri&s;t, the eternal Son of God;</HI> and through the power of that faith they have in him, he comes to rule over them, and they become &s;ubject to him. And if a beliver be not &s;ubject to Chri&s;t, he is all one as if he was an unbeliever; <HI>cir|cumci&s;ion, or uncircumci&s;ion, avails not any things but a new creature; and faith which worketh by love.</HI></P>
<P>The covenant doth not &s;tand in meer words; if I con|form to &s;uch articles, then I am a Chri&s;tian; if I be|lieve
<PB N="340" REF="020309_0340_0FAEF87FA6FADDD8">
all the articles of the creed, then I am a Chri&s;tian, and a child of God. If a man will &s;ay, I believe, his &s;ay &s;o is not &s;ufficient. The condition of the covenant that God hath made, is, that Chri&s;t &s;hall rule and have the government of tho&s;e &s;ouls that he pre&s;ents to God: How &s;hould it be otherwi&s;e, &s;eeing he is not to pre&s;ent any to God that are unclean? Chri&s;t hath no commi&s;&s;i|on to pre&s;ent any to God in their uncleanne&s;s and wick|edne&s;s. He that believeth, mu&s;t be clean&s;ed and purified by him: If &s;o, then that cannot be done, but by ruling over them. If they had the rule of them&s;elves, they would be polluted, and be like water, who&s;e current is &s;topped with dirt and mud, not running in its own proper &s;tream. People will commit &s;in, when they have the rule of them|&s;elves; but when Chri&s;t pre&s;ents people to God, and when they come to be led by him, they are clean&s;ed and pu|rified.</P>
<P>When the apo&s;tle de&s;cribes true faith, he doth it by this quality and property of it, <HI>it purifies the heart.</HI> All other faith is <HI>but the hope of the hypocrite;</HI> but real faith is <HI>the ope|ration of God,</HI> faith the apo&s;tle; and that faith worketh in an unclean heart to the clean&s;ing of it, and in an impure heart to the purifying of it: If the heart comes to be puri|fied, then it mu&s;t needs follow that the conver&s;ation mu&s;t be pure al&s;o. No one doth an ill work, or &s;peaks an ill word, but it is from an evil heart. Now if the <HI>axe come to be laid to the root of the tree,</HI> and the word of the Lord operate in the heart powerfully, if ever &s;o much evil be in it, the axe when laid to the root of the tree will cut it down; the power of God will execute judgment upon every thing that is contrary to him; Chri&s;t is <HI>holy, harm|le&s;s, and undefiled, and &s;eparare from &s;in and &s;inners;</HI> and though he extend his life and virtue to the life and &s;oul of the mo&s;t wicked man in the world, it never joins with their uncleanne&s;s, but keeps immaculate and undefiled in the heart of the wor&s;t of men.</P>
<P>Now this immaculate power that comes from Chri&s;t, it will <HI>purify the hearts</HI> of men, and pre&s;erve them from evil thoughts, words and actions. This is the manife&s;tation of the one Mediator that they mu&s;t be governed by, el&s;e they
<PB N="341" REF="020309_0341_0FAEF880E49D94B8">
cannot be pre&s;ented &s;potle&s;s to God the Father. There is a nece&s;&s;ity of coming to a Saviour otherwi&s;e than by words and profe&s;&s;ion; we mu&s;t come to him and heartily join with him; we have all joined with the devil, he hath &s;ugge&s;ted, moved, and in&s;tigated, and people have followed his in&s;tigations and motions; there is no man but is &s;en|&s;ible of a devili&s;h motion, why not then of a divine mo|tion? Though now it is become a bugbear to &s;ay, we are moved by the Spirit of Chri&s;t, why not by that Spirit, as well as by the &s;pirit of the wicked one? No man doubts but that there are motions of the devil which they are &s;en|&s;ible of, that &s;ometimes they have joined with him, and &s;ometimes they with&s;tand him. What is the rea&s;on that men &s;hould join with evil motions? There is no ju&s;t rea|&s;on for it. The rea&s;on why you and I with&s;tand the motions of the devil, is becau&s;e we find another motion conveyed into our hearts by the Spirit of God; if a man hath one motion to commit uncleanne&s;s, he hath another motion to keep him&s;elf pure; if he hath a motion to &s;peak a lie, he hath another motion to &s;peak truth; there are two movers at the &s;ame time, in the &s;ame heart, which &s;hall we join with? Shall I join with the devil's motion? If I find any thing of the love of God in my heart, it will con&s;train me to mind the good motion, and make me with|&s;tand the evil motion; &s;o that the moving of the Spirit of God is not &s;uch a wonder.</P>
<P>There are none who have not had bad motions in them, and they have al&s;o motions of the Spirit of truth; they have met with evil motions, and they have admired them too much, then it is time to repent; if there be a di&s;tinc|tion between a motion of the Spirit of truth, and a mo|tion of the &s;pirit of error, then I may boldly &s;ay, it is our duty to join with the Spirit of truth, and not with the &s;pirit of error; if there be a de&s;ire in us <HI>to be &s;aved from the wrath to come,</HI> then the way to be &s;aved from God's wrath is to be &s;aved from the cau&s;e of it; take away the cau&s;e and the effect cea&s;eth. The cau&s;e of God's wrath being kindled again&s;t man is &s;in, for God had no wrath again&s;t man when he fir&s;t made him; for he made him after his own image, and gave him power to continue in
<PB N="342" REF="020309_0342_0FAEF881596B4F18">
that holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, wherein he created him&punc; but he fell, and was ca&s;t out of paradi&s;e, and an angel was &s;ent <HI>with a flaming &s;word that turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</HI> Thus man fell under the wrath of God by his &s;in; but how &s;hall I have the wrath of God allayed? By breaking off from &s;in, and returning to God again.</P>
<P>This looks like a covenant of works, &s;ay &s;ome; do you &s;ay I mu&s;t break off from &s;in, and &s;o e&s;cape the wrath of God?</P>
<P>Yes, I do; but no mortal man can break off from &s;in but by joining with the Mediator, <HI>he is the author of eter|nal &s;alvation, he worketh in us to will and to do, and en|ableth us to work out our own &s;alvation;</HI> it was &s;in that drove man out of paradi&s;e, and brought upon him the wrath of God. Sin is the devil's work; now that Chri&s;t might be a Saviour to us, he will de&s;troy the devil's work; <HI>for this purpo&s;e,</HI> &s;aith the apo&s;tle, <HI>the Son of God was ma|nife&s;ted that he might de&s;troy the works of the devil.</HI> Now the devil was not the de&s;truction of man &s;imply in him|&s;elf, but by tempting him to &s;in, which is the devil's work; and Chri&s;t <HI>was manife&s;ted, to de&s;troy the devil's work;</HI> that propen&s;ity to &s;in that is in the nature of man, which makes him rebel again&s;t the mind and will of God. Chri&s;t the eternal Son of God became man; he took the nature of man, that he might bring man again to his primitive &s;tate, wherein <HI>he was created after the image of God.</HI></P>
<P>Now how doth the devil perform his works? doth he do his works coercively? No, he u&s;eth no irre&s;i&s;tible force. But doth Chri&s;t the Mediator work coercively, with an irre&s;i&s;tible power and force, to bring a man again to God? No, no more than the devil did to beguile man from God. Man might have &s;tood and continued in his &s;tate of in|nocency if he would; he might join with evil, and yield to the temptation of the devil, if he had a mind; he knew if he gave over his mind to evil, he &s;hould be ruined; and it proved &s;o. Man was re&s;olved to try what it was to yield to the devil, and obey him. He told them that if they did eat of the forbidden fruit they &s;hould be as Gods, but they became more like the devil; this they got by be|ing
<PB N="343" REF="020309_0343_0FAEF882EA3BBCB0">
obedient unto him, not that the devil laid an irre&s;i&s;tible force upon them, you &s;hall eat of the fruit of this tree; but there was only a pre&s;entation of it to them, and with that he prevailed, and &s;o came to the de&s;truction of mankind.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t the Mediator, in order that he may pre&s;ent us to God, comes him&s;elf and pre&s;ents his commands to us, and his command is, that we mu&s;t break off from that &s;er|vitude and &s;ubjection that the devil hath brought man into, and there mu&s;t be a &s;ubjection unto Chri&s;t; we mu&s;t be|lieve in Chri&s;t, and hearken to the word of God, and break off from &s;in; but where is the power? If God would have me holy, let him make me holy; if he would have me pure, let him make me &s;o, and give me ability to do that which of my&s;elf I cannot do; when it plea&s;eth God to give me grace and captivate my will, I &s;hall become a good Chri&s;tian. Now here is a great mi&s;take, that people &s;hould think they mu&s;t wait for an irre&s;i&s;tible power to bring them back to God; there is a pre&s;entation of love and mercy, and earne&s;t invitations, and the long-&s;uffering and patience and goodne&s;s of God's long waiting upon &s;inners. <HI>God, who commanded light to &s;hine out of dark|ne&s;s, hath &s;hined into our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, 2 Cor.</HI> iv. 6. What &s;hall I do with the light that &s;hines into my heart? I will &s;hut mine eyes again&s;t it; I love darkne&s;s rather than light, and evil more than good; this light will lead me to holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, I will quarrel with it, it comes to bereave me of my comforts in this world, of my merry companions, and of all my bra|very, I will not hearken to it. Alas! for the&s;e; <HI>this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men love darkne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e their deeds are evil,</HI> &s;aith our Saviour. <HI>If I had not come and &s;poken to them, they had no &s;in, but now they have no cloak for their &s;in.</HI></P>
<P>Here is the go&s;pel preached by Chri&s;t him&s;elf; here is the pre&s;entation of an opportunity for every man and wo|man to return again; but I mu&s;t be in the way of return|ing, that is, by joining with that which pre&s;ents to me holine&s;s, righteou&s;ne&s;s, cha&s;tity and humility, that pre&s;ents
<PB N="344" REF="020309_0344_0FAEF8834DCF08C0">
and offers to the &s;oul all the virtues and graces that are in Chri&s;t, and &s;hews it the light and grace that comes from Chri&s;t. Now this light and grace &s;hewing it&s;elf to my &s;oul, I have a view of. Ha&s;t thou a view of it? Ha&s;t thou &s;een purity, humility, &s;obriety, meekne&s;s, and &s;elf-denial, and an heavenly frame of &s;pirit in thy&s;elf or &s;ome|body el&s;e? How do&s;t thou like it? I like it not at all; I love to have honour and dignity, power and dominion, and my elbow-room in the world; I love not this meek|ne&s;s, humility and &s;trictne&s;s of life, that a man mu&s;t have a care what he &s;peaks, and &s;et a watch upon his lips, and upon his heart, tongue, and hands, I do not like this kind of life.</P>
<P>If thou do&s;t not like a good life, &s;omebody will like it, and live in it; and notwith&s;tanding all thy vapouring, thy hating, and de&s;pi&s;ing it, when people come to live this kind of ife, they will outlive thee; thy proud life, they reign|ing life, and thy having elbow-room in the world, will at la&s;t come to be limited; the hand of God is again&s;t it, and it will bring down the pride of man. When thou come&s;t to lie upon thy dying pillow, expecting every mo|ment to expire, and breathe thy la&s;t, then thou wilt &s;ay, O that I had been more &s;erious, and lived more like a Chri&s;tian; lived a godly life, and given up my heart to God, and been more watchful over my thoughts, words and actions! There is &s;uch a friend of mine, that hath lived better than I; if I had lived &s;uch a life as he hath lived, I &s;hould have had more comfort; and they that are de&s;pi&s;ers of the godly, tho' they do not like &s;uch a life now, they will like it then.</P>
<P>Friends, you that are lovers of your &s;ouls, and meet to|gether that you may become better, and have expectation and hope, that you &s;hall receive comfort and benefit by your meeting together, I tell you, as a &s;ervant of God, and a lover of yours, it is but a little while, and you will wi&s;h that you had cho&s;en the mo&s;t holy, harmle&s;s, innocent life, that ever you &s;aw your&s;elves, or heard of from any body el&s;e; and you will wi&s;h that you had been more watchful over your thoughts, words and actions. There is a day, a day approaching, when we mu&s;t give
<PB N="345" REF="020309_0345_0FAEF88544DC52E0">
an account for every thing that we have done, <HI>whether good or evil;</HI> you mu&s;t give an account for your cur&s;ed debauchery; for your &s;wearing, lying, and inordinate pa&s;|&s;ions; you mu&s;t give an account for every vain thought, and every idle word.</P>
<P>If this will certainly come to pa&s;s, how &s;hall I prevent the&s;e idle words and evil actions? <HI>Wherewith &s;hall a young man clean&s;e his way,</HI> &s;aith the P&s;almi&s;t? <HI>By taking heed thereto, according to thy word.</HI> I am not as tho&s;e that &s;ay <HI>lo here and lo there:</HI> I do not &s;ay, you mu&s;t come and learn truth of me, but if you find it, you mu&s;t find it in your&s;elves: What if I live in the truth? That will not &s;erve <HI>thee;</HI> and if I be a holy man, that will not &s;anctify <HI>thee;</HI> thou mu&s;t hearken to truth's &s;peaking in thy&s;elf; thou maye&s;t hear it &s;peaking in thine own heart; you may hear it call you to righteou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s; and if you hear it, you may do it too, if you plea&s;e; for there is a power that goes along with it.</P>
<P>I know enough, thou wilt &s;ay, but I cannot do what I know; I have not power. What ails thee that thou ha&s;t not power? If I had power, then would I ab&s;tain from all &s;in, and break off from my evil ways; but the devil throws this object and the other object in my way, and by his temptations he doth en&s;nare me, I have not power to re&s;i&s;t: Would you have me do more than I can do? and as long as I have not power I am to be excu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Now here is a device of the devil to keep people in his net &s;till. If men would be true to them&s;elves, they would not be long without power: If thou art convinced of the evil of thy ways, and that it is thy duty to break off from &s;in, there is a power offered to thee, that, if thou joine&s;t with, thou maye&s;t overcome all temptations, and for|&s;ake thy &s;in: I would have you all prove, and &s;earch, and &s;ee whether I &s;peak truth or no; I am per&s;uaded there is not a man or woman here but they have &s;ometime ab|&s;tained from an evil work, which they were tempted to. How were you re&s;trained; becau&s;e you knew it was an evil work, you dur&s;t not do it; the devil had not a coer|cive power to force you to do it; I knew it was an evil thing, and I joined with that in my mind which di&s;&s;uaded
<PB N="346" REF="020309_0346_0FAEF88651D7EAB8">
me from it; and I prayed to God to give me power to ab&s;tain from it. The devil tempted thee on &s;till, who helped thee again&s;t the temptation? God re&s;trained thee by his grace. Will not he be a pre&s;ent help unto thee? <HI>he is the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to-day, and forever;</HI> depend upon him &s;till, and he will be always ready to help thee, and &s;upport thee, and &s;trengthen thee, and thou &s;halt be kept from &s;in in an hour of temptation: Con&s;ider that all power in Heaven and Earth is given to Chri&s;t, and if he be able to keep thee thou &s;halt not fall into it; <HI>tho&s;e that come unto me,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>none &s;hall pluck them out of my hands, and my Father is greater than all.</HI> If thou come&s;t unto Chri&s;t, <HI>he will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t thee out,</HI> and if thou depend upon him, he will pre&s;erve thee, and <HI>none &s;hall be able to pluck thee out of his hand.</HI> If thou join with the truth, and with that which is holy, thou &s;halt have &s;trength and ability to with&s;tand temptation and over|come it; and (I may &s;peak with reverence) Chri&s;t hath bound him&s;elf to tho&s;e that tru&s;t in him; <HI>tho&s;e that keep the word of my patience, I will keep them in the hour of temptation.</HI> If I keep waiting upon his power, that is ready to help me, and have a mind to be purified and &s;anctified, and to have righteou&s;ne&s;s brought into my &s;oul, and have mine eyes unto God, and my expectations from him, he <HI>will work in me to will and to do of his good plea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>Now here people have a fixed foundation for their faith; but there is no working at this rate without bearing a daily cro&s;s. There are a great many can receive the truth in words, and receive doctrines, and tenets, and that with delight; but there is no practi&s;ing holine&s;s and righteou&s;|ne&s;s without a daily cro&s;s and &s;elf-denial. There are a great many who have come to truth, as far as it &s;tands in words, but when it comes to &s;omething that they mu&s;t do, to &s;peak the truth, and live in the truth, they meet with &s;o much of the temptation of the devil, &s;o much lu&s;t and corruption, and ungodline&s;s in them&s;elves; they meet with &s;uch evil things that their &s;ouls join with and yield to, that they cannot go on in the ways of holine&s;s, unle&s;s they look up to Je&s;us, and have an eye to their Saviour,
<PB N="347" REF="020309_0347_0FAEF8870CF0E978">
and take up his cro&s;s and follow him. What&s;oever re|proaches, &s;ufferings, and per&s;ecutions they endure, they mu&s;t have a godly re&s;olution to follow the Lord Chri&s;t, and &s;ay, I will obey his commands, he &s;hall have the rule and government of my life, and be the guide of my way; what&s;oever &s;tands in my way, I will take up my cro&s;s and deny my&s;elf; without this there is no good Chri&s;|tianity in the world.</P>
<P>There are a great many that &s;eem to be religious and are profe&s;&s;ors of the truth: We all know there are many profe&s;&s;ors of the truth in notion, and with &s;ome zeal will talk of it; but they do not know how to live and walk in the truth, they do not live uprightly and hone&s;tly in it; they do not keep their words; they do not live ju&s;tly and hone&s;tly with all men, nor do unto others as they would have others do to them: They can tell how to &s;peak and act; then why do they not do it? They have got a no|tion that they are above the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, and &s;elf-denial is far below them. People will not live in the truth.</P>
<P>This is wanting in the whole world: If we look around we &s;hall find a great many are illuminated; there is abundance of knowledge and under&s;tanding among profe&s;&s;ors, abun|dance of learning, and great numbers of learned men: What is the rea&s;on that oaths, and cur&s;es, and all manner of wickedne&s;s run down the &s;treets like a river; there is pride, and wrath, and envy, and revenge, and violence to be found among us, as if it would draw down vengeance up|on us. They have heard preached in pulpits much of holine&s;s, humility, patience and meekne&s;s, <HI>that a meek and quiet &s;pirit is an ornament of great price:</HI> Men have heard much preaching again&s;t pride, prophanene&s;s, and drunk|enne&s;s, and uncleanne&s;s, but they have heard it <HI>like a tale that is told,</HI> not much concerned about it, and have giv|en little credit or regard to what they have heard of the&s;e things. Why are people &s;o wicked? The rea&s;on at la&s;t re&s;ults in this, <HI>men are lovers of plea&s;ures more than lovers of God,</HI> they are <HI>not the &s;ervants of Chri&s;t, but &s;erve di|vers lu&s;ts, and plea&s;ures, and are led captive by the devil, at his will;</HI> and &s;o they go on in iniquity. No laws can
<PB N="348" REF="020309_0348_0FAEF887CEA3A670">
re&s;train and curb them, when the law of Chri&s;t is not written in their hearts; but when men come to &s;ee a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of &s;elf-denial and taking up the cro&s;s, this will pro|duce a reformation.</P>
<P>This is what I labour for, and all good men and women will do it: It is time to try for reformation. Vain fa&s;hions, and garbs, and pride have been cried up, why &s;hould not we cry for reformation before the wrath of a provoked God is kindled again&s;t us, and his vengeance poured down upon the nation? We mu&s;t reform our lives. How &s;hall men reform, you will &s;ay? By getting the <HI>law of God within their hearts,</HI> that is pure, and holy, and heavenly, that will be <HI>as a light to mens feet, and a lan|thorn to their paths:</HI> Now till people come to this they will go on in &s;in and iniquity, till they be &s;wept away with &s;ome overflowing and dreadful judgment.</P>
<P>So that, my friends, in the fear of God, and out of love to you, I &s;eek that you may be brought to God, through Chri&s;t; that you may live in the love and fear of the Lord, and, when you come to die, you may have re&s;t and peace for your &s;ouls. There is no re&s;t for tho&s;e that are evil-doers; <HI>there is no peace, &s;aith my God, to the wicked.</HI> The ungodly <HI>cry, peace, peace,</HI> and talk of peace, but there is no peace for them, but they &s;hall have for their portion <HI>tribulation, and wrath, and angui&s;h;</HI> this &s;hall certainly come upon every one that doth evil. It is no matter what religion you are of, if you do not obey the truth, but live in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Now, friends, my exhortation to you all is, that you will return to the truth in your own hearts, and do it while you have time. I am not per&s;uading people to love my opinion, but to love God's truth in their own hearts, to love it and obey it, and you cannot do this unle&s;s you re&s;olve to take up a daily cro&s;s, and be followers of Chri&s;t, who is gone before to prepare a place for them that are his true di&s;ciples; and then he will pre&s;ent them to God, <HI>as holy, harmle&s;s, and unde&s;iled,</HI> for the&s;e are heirs of that everla&s;ting kingdom, <HI>which God hath prepared for them that love him.</HI></P>

<P>This comes by rea&s;on of the great darkne&s;s that is over the &s;ons and daughters of men in general, in which they have lo&s;t their way, and are endeavouring to find it again: But the &s;ubtle adver&s;ary led them out of the way, and as long as he leads and they follow, they will never find the right way: The great calamity that is come upon the world in this re&s;pect, is very greatly to be lamented; for when the eye of the mind is opened, to behold the univer&s;al &s;tate of mankind, and to &s;ee how they are &s;cattered hi|ther and thither, and often left in confu&s;ion, by the craft and delu&s;ion of the wicked one, and that none of the ways that they have found, are like to bring them to the propo&s;ed end, becau&s;e they are defiled, becau&s;e they are, unholy; this hath bowed down the &s;pirit of the Lord's &s;ervants many times, and a great cry hath ari&s;en in the hearts of tho&s;e that have &s;een the fruition and enjoyment of life eternal; O, that the &s;ons of men might hear! and O that they might con&s;ider their ways before they come to their latter end! for mark friends, this you may take for a certain doctrine, and a &s;ure rule in judgment, con|cerning all the ways that the &s;ons and daughters of men walk in; <HI>if they be unholy, they will be unprofitable;</HI> the

way of the Lord was, and is, and ever will be the way of holine&s;s, and the people that walk therein, they were, and are, and they will always be a holy people; now the &s;ons and daughters of men have not gone to mea&s;ure their way by this rule, but the greate&s;t endeavours that ever have been in the world, from the beginning (the greate&s;t en|deavours that men did undertake) were to &s;ee how near they could approve their doctrine and practice with the &s;criptures of truth, and that hath been the bone of con|tention, that they have &s;tumbled about from one generation to another, one crying my way is right; and here they have been contending, di&s;puting, and jangling and deba|ting one with another, and could never agree, and could never come to that under&s;tanding, which is given by the Holy Spirit, that moved holy men to write the Holy Scriptures of truth; if they had, it is manife&s;t they would have agreed, for this one &s;pirit mu&s;t agree with it&s;elf, and will give judgment according to its own righteous judgment: Men being alienated from the life of God, by evil works, and by the &s;ugge&s;tions of &s;atan, they have not known the way of peace, and have not come to that which is the de&s;ire of all nations, as now in the fulne&s;s of time, the Lord God eternal, who created the Heavens and the Earth, the &s;ea and the fountains of water, he hath looked down and beheld the mi&s;erable calamitous &s;tate of the &s;ons and daughters of men, and he hath &s;een how they have been &s;cattered and driven to and fro by idle &s;hep|herds, and how every one hath indulged him&s;elf in his own way, though unholy and impure; and it is becau&s;e of the darkne&s;s of the night of ignorance that hath been over the people; and therefore in his infinite love and mercy, he is ri&s;en, and hath brought forth his light and his truth, that the nations might be enlightened, that they might come and &s;ee with a divine eye that the truth is but one, and the way but one, and all that do really de&s;ire to be inheritors of eternal life, mu&s;t come to walk in that way. So that people are never brought back again out of that way wherein they have been &s;cattered and driven about, till they come to &s;ee the way they practi&s;e to bring forth iniquity; they &s;ee there is no light to be had in
<PB N="351" REF="020309_0351_0FAEF88A13F490F8">
them, they &s;ee the anger of God kindled, and the indig|nation of God poured out by rea&s;on of &s;in and unholine&s;s.</P>
<P>Now when they come to be convinced by the light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us of their di&s;obedience, then they come to feel and find a principle, a &s;eed and root that gives them a law which they &s;hould obey, and hear the right law-giver, and have re&s;pect unto him: Here is the revelation of Chri&s;t Je&s;us by his Spirit, and this extends it&s;elf in its operation and working to the &s;ons of men, to them that are afar off, as well as to tho&s;e that are nigh; therefore our continual exhortation, from time to time, according as the &s;pirit hath given us utterance, is not &s;o much to make profe&s;&s;ion of this and the other doctrine of Chri&s;ti|anity, as to per&s;uade all men every where, that they be|lieve in the light, and hearken to the voice of the light in their own con&s;ciences, that they hearken to that which is purely of God in them&s;elves, as we know, who&s;oever comes to love the light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, wherewith they are enlightened, it would di&s;cover doctrine to them, and make known faith and practice too; it will lead them in the way everla&s;ting, it will open their under&s;tanding far above all preaching this and the other doctrine and tenet.</P>
<P>What &s;ignifies it to &s;hew colours to the blind, or to &s;peak words to the dead; till men come to have their &s;en&s;es opened, that they may di&s;cern things belonging to the &s;pirit of truth, the carnal man cannot under&s;tand the things of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, the carnal man is not &s;ub|ject to the law of God, neither indeed can be; there mu&s;t be &s;omething done in the &s;oul, to bring it out of its car|nality, and bring it to &s;omething that is &s;piritual, before it is capable of under&s;tanding the things of the &s;pirit: Therefore when our minds can witne&s;s what we came hither for, when we meet to &s;erve and wor&s;hip God, we &s;hall have a hope to receive &s;ome illumination, &s;ome refre&s;hment, &s;ome comfort, or &s;ome knowledge of things divine; it is in vain to attend religious doctrines with an irreligious mind. It is my judgment of charity, that every one that comes hither, hath &s;ome expectation of illumination in their un|der&s;tandings, &s;ome gift, or &s;ome in&s;truction; this they may receive from the God of Heaven, by the mini&s;try of tho&s;e
<PB N="352" REF="020309_0352_0FAEF88CE5CA7BF8">
who mu&s;t be the mouth of God, to &s;peak to them in his name: When people are thus prepared, and their minds fixed to hear the truth; if they do not find it in them|&s;elves, if they come not to a &s;en&s;e of the word of life in their own hearts, their hearing cannot give them life. We are commending our&s;elves to every man's con&s;cience; let your minds be turned inward, &s;earch and con&s;ider, is there a light that enlightens every man that comes into the world? Is there a de&s;ire of eternal life manife&s;ted in me? Is there that in me that puts me upon obedience to God, to mend my life and conver&s;ation, that I might be recommended to God? Is there &s;omething in me that checks me when I &s;peak ami&s;s, and do ami&s;s? I do appeal to the witne&s;s of God in you; if that be &s;o, then believe me for the word's &s;ake, the te&s;timony of God in your hearts.</P>
<P>Let us next con&s;ider, whether we had be&s;t agree on this conclu&s;ion, that God hath enlightened us, and whether we had not be&s;t obey that light; this is the be&s;t way, let us put the que&s;tion, and wait for an an&s;wer from our&s;elves. There is much indeed to be &s;aid on the other &s;ide: If I &s;hould hear and obey that by which I am enlightened, if I &s;hould hearken to the reproof of my own con&s;cience, I &s;hould lo&s;e a great deal of the plea&s;ure and of the com|fort of the world, I &s;hould lo&s;e a great deal of the profit which I gain in my trade and calling, and of the delight and plea&s;ure I have with my neighbour.</P>
<P>This is not to be denied; I would have things put in the balance; I grant you will lo&s;e &s;ome plea&s;ure, and un|godly gain, and the friend&s;hip of the world; but pray con&s;ider, and let us go through the account: If thou obeye&s;t this light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, this is God's way of drawing thee nearer to him&s;elf, to make thee an heir of his eternal kingdom; whereas by thy indulging thy car|nal parts, thou wilt lo&s;e thy immortal &s;oul; if thou &s;houlde&s;t gain the whole world, and lo&s;e thy own &s;oul, what will it profit thee? Thou &s;houlde&s;t con&s;ider, why I am en|lightened; how comes it to pa&s;s that my nature is evil, and I am fallen from my primitive &s;tate, from the know|ledge of God, and from the enjoyment of his pre&s;ence, and communion with him? How comes God to take no|tice
<PB N="353" REF="020309_0353_0FAEF88E93ECEBF0">
of me, and to enlighten me and kindle in me a de|&s;ire of returing to him? why &s;hould he do this for me? Thou wilt never find a rea&s;on in thy&s;elf of this extraor|dinary kindne&s;s, of this &s;ingular mercy of God to thee; it is becau&s;e his mercy moved him, and it was his compa&s;|&s;ion that &s;tirred him up: He hath &s;ent his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t into the world, that men might have light in and through him, and have it abundantly. The mercy of God is a fountain from whence all this flows to us; if this prevail not upon thee, no argument will: What, was it meer mer|cy, meer grace, that God was not willing to &s;ee me pe|ri&s;h, and run headlong to de&s;truction? He was loath to execute his wrath upon me, therefore he found out a way by which I might return to him. This made a good man cry out, behold! what manner of love is this, wherewith the Father hath loved us? Here is the grace of God; here is the good will of God; here is the way; a way, what way? A way of coming to God; a way of being again reconciled unto God, whom we had provoked by our &s;ins; a way of enjoying eternal life again, after we had lo&s;t all pretence to it.</P>
<P>The next que&s;tion is, who will walk in the way that leads to eternal life? We would all have eternal life; it is the univer&s;al con&s;ent of all nations; all would have eternal life; but the que&s;tion is, who will walk in the way that leads to it? Some of the nations round about, and many in this nation, they will walk in their own way, and yet they would have eternal life; but their way mu&s;t be of the &s;ame nature and quality with the life they would have; if the way they walk in be not of the &s;ame nature and quality, it will not lead to it. Let every one exa|mine their way; let every one examine their progre&s;s, and their lives and foot&s;teps in this world; if they &s;ow to the fle&s;h, they &s;hall of the fle&s;h reap corruption; and if they &s;ow to the &s;pirit, they &s;hall of the &s;pirit reap life ever|la&s;ting; a &s;uitable fruit to that life they live, and the way they walk in. If we conclude with rea&s;on; with pure, found rea&s;on, we mu&s;t conclude it is better for us all to walk in the way of holine&s;s; and we &s;hall have more rea&s;on to believe that we &s;hall have life eternal, than in
<PB N="354" REF="020309_0354_0FAEF8901BB60E20">
walking in an unholy way, therefore we &s;hould be re&s;olved to walk in the way of holine&s;s; and if people are brought to this, it is an ea&s;y thing to draw them to confe&s;&s;ion: You &s;ay true, it is better to walk in a holy way than an un|holy way; but alas! we have not power &s;o to do; we are feeble, weak, dark and ignorant; and we have many lu&s;ts, temptations and impediments, lying in our way, that it is not po&s;&s;ible for any to walk in that way; we know the way, we under&s;tand the way well enough; you would have us walk by the &s;ight of Chri&s;t, and the dictates of our own con&s;ciencies, then we &s;hould never be condemned for any thing we do, but we &s;hould &s;tand in an openne&s;s of acce&s;s to God; when a man &s;inneth again&s;t God, &s;in lies at the door; but they that &s;in not, have an acce&s;s to God. Alas, the&s;e things cannot be done! What can a poor creature do that wants power?</P>
<P>My friends, this excu&s;e mu&s;t go no further; let us try and con&s;ider in the pre&s;ence of God this day, the pow|erful God that is the a&s;&s;i&s;ter of his people; let us try how far this will go, I have no power of my&s;elf; all good men grant it to be true, you have not power to walk in the way of holine&s;s: But let us ask another que&s;tion; doth God require of thee and me to walk in the way of holine&s;s, and doth he deny power to us to walk in it? We can|not walk in the way of holine&s;s, but by the operation of his power working in us, unto the extingui&s;hing of the life of &s;in and corruption, that hath hindered us all this while; God knows we cannot do it our&s;elves. Chri&s;t tells his di&s;ciples, without me ye can do nothing, nothing good, nothing that is right. This being concluded on, all power comes from God; the next que&s;tion is, how, and which way mu&s;t we receive power from God greater than our own power? Which is the way of people's receiving pow|er from God? You have read how people came to have power; <HI>to as many as believed, to them he gave power to become the &s;ons of God.</HI> What &s;ignifies this to them that do not believe? If believing be the way to obtain pow|er, it is nothing to tho&s;e that do not believe; there faith is nece&s;&s;ary, in the fir&s;t place, for obtaining of this pow|er: This is a great my&s;tery, &s;uch an odd &s;aying, that the
<PB N="355" REF="020309_0355_0FAEF890D1814320">
world knows not what to make of it: Believers, we are all believers; I believe the truth of the principles of the Chri&s;tian religion, and I believe all the articles of the creed: To talk of believing at this time of the day, we have believed this twenty, or thirty, or forty years, but the fir&s;t act of faith is yet to be done after your &s;en&s;e: It is true, with the greate&s;t part of the nation; the fir&s;t act of faith is not yet begun, for their faith is men's faith: We are for the faith that was delivered to the &s;aints; it is the gift of God, it comes from the operation of God; &s;o that I may conclude, who&s;oever remains a &s;tranger to the operation of God, he is a &s;tranger to the true faith; and they who e&s;trange them&s;elves from that which God worketh, are &s;trangers to the operation of God. There|fore, till people's minds are turned to Chri&s;t, whom God hath &s;ent, who is appointed to be for &s;alvation to the ends of the earth; till men come to reduce the govern|ment both of the &s;oul and body to him, as the captain of their &s;alvation; till they come to be thus re&s;igned, they cannot come to the true faith.</P>
<P>Now when God worketh this re&s;ignation in us, a man will reflect upon him&s;elf and &s;ay, alas I have been mine own keeper too long, I &s;ee I have gone off from God, now I will return to him, and re&s;ign up my&s;elf to the Lord, that he may work in me what he plea&s;eth to work: When men come to this re&s;ignation of &s;oul, they have faith given them, they mu&s;t believe God will never leave them nor for&s;ake them, but he will magnify his power in their weakne&s;s; I will re&s;t my &s;oul upon him, and ca&s;t my care upon him that careth for me; it is not faith bare|ly in words, and in the articles of the creed, but it is a <HI>faith in the Son of God, to whom all power in Heaven and Earth is given;</HI> I may expect a &s;hare of it, he will give me a little, if I come to him for it; and if I be faith|ful in a little, he will give me more; the rea&s;on why you want power, is, becau&s;e you want faith; and the rea&s;on of your want of faith, is, becau&s;e you want a re&s;ignation to the will of God; you will be your own carvers, and your own keepers and guides. When you come to this re&s;ignation to the will of God, God will give you power,
<PB N="356" REF="020309_0356_0FAEF89186958430">
and then you will find him the God of all grace; you are what you are by the grace of God, and by his power, and by that power you will obey his will: Here is faith that giveth glory to God, to that God that takes an un|holy man and makes him holy; how doth he this? By his holy &s;pirit, which is as fire that burneth up that which is corruptible; then the man is well (I &s;peak ac|cording to the dictates of the &s;pirit) when he is recon|ciled to God by Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Mediator between God and man, the Mediator of the new covenant, who maketh our peace. That you may come to the knowledge of the day of the Lord's vi&s;itation, is what our &s;ouls labour and travel for, that you may be in the unity of the &s;ame &s;pirit after the de&s;ire of all nations is come; he is come to you, that you may all &s;ay within your&s;elves, <HI>&s;alvation this day is come to our hou&s;es, and into our hearts.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SERMON XXXI. CHRIST ALL <HI>in</HI> ALL.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Preached at DEVONSHIRE-HOUSE, <DATE>June 10, 1688.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>THE Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the light, life and virtue that can only &s;atisfy. Chri&s;t is all in all.</P>
<P>There is nothing can &s;atisfy the &s;ouls of the up|right, unle&s;s they feel life and <HI>virtue</HI> to flow from Chri&s;t Je&s;us; and this, whether it flow in&s;trumentally or im|mediately, always comforteth; it always refre&s;heth the up|right in heart.</P>
<P>Therefore all they that de&s;ire &s;atisfaction to their &s;ouls, that meet together upon that account, they ought to have their eyes turned to the Lord, that they may be capa|ble to under&s;tand the mini&s;tration of the &s;pirit, whether in them&s;elves, or through any other. For while they are exerci&s;ed outwardly, and the dependence of their &s;ouls is upon that which is outward, there remains a <HI>veil</HI> upon the mind, that they many times hear excellent things &s;po|ken of the kingdom of God, but they under&s;tand them
<PB N="357" REF="020309_0357_0FAEF89251CFB910">
not, becau&s;e they are alienated and e&s;tranged in their minds from <HI>that</HI> of <HI>God</HI> in them&s;elves, that &s;hould give them an under&s;tanding. We never pretend to give people an un|der&s;tanding, we have always &s;aid, that is the work of God. We have &s;poken many things of the <HI>kingdom of God,</HI> ex|cellent things have been revealed to us by his holy &s;pirit, and the &s;ame &s;pirit hath given us utterance, to &s;peak of the great things of the law of God; yet many, that have been con&s;tant hearers of the&s;e things, remain ignorant, and are in&s;en&s;ible, becau&s;e they are not exerci&s;ed in their own mea&s;ure of the grace and light of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by which they &s;hould receive and under&s;tand them.</P>
<P>This hath made me often lament the ca&s;e of many of the people of this city and nation, who are daily hear|ers of the word of God preached, and retain it not in their hearts: The &s;owers are gone out to &s;ow, but ma|ny receive it in the <HI>high-way-ground;</HI> the way that every thing can pa&s;s in, there they receive the word &s;own, and the devil catcheth it away; and though they have heard excellent things, of the &s;trength, ability and power of God, that he mini&s;treth to his people, they remain &s;o weak and &s;o feeble, that they are blown away with every bla&s;t of the adver&s;ary, with every temptation, and with every &s;nare and gin that is laid for them, they are catched, and en&s;nared, and taken; and &s;o the&s;e come to meetings again and again, one year after another: I might &s;ay unto you, wherefore do you come? It may be you may &s;ay, we de&s;ire to be &s;atisfied; we de&s;ire &s;atisfaction for our &s;ouls. Do you &s;o? Then I tell you, you may come all the days of your life, and want it, and lay down your heads in &s;orrow at la&s;t for all that. For all the words in the world will never communicate that heavenly life and vir|tue which brings true &s;atisfaction to the &s;oul, unto any, except to tho&s;e that have an exerci&s;e in their own mind and &s;pirits, in that which they have of God; they mu&s;t fir&s;t be brought to know the way they &s;hould walk in, and to believe that is the way: When people believe this is my way, the light within is my way, the grace of God is my way; that &s;earches and tries my heart, that is my way I mu&s;t walk in, &s;peak in, and think in, and do all
<PB N="358" REF="020309_0358_0FAEF893117928E8">
that I have to do in; when I believe this is that way, then this belief obligeth men to take heed to their ways, to their foot&s;teps. And here they that are thus exerci&s;ed, are in a tender care every &s;tep they take in their way; and &s;o perhaps they may receive great benefits by hearing the reports they do daily hear from tho&s;e that were in the way before them, and have travelled further in it, than they ever yet have done. The experiences of the &s;ervants of the Lord, are daily helpful to them, and they are daily comforted, &s;trengthened, and confirmed, to hear how they have &s;ped, that have travelled through their condition, and through their pre&s;ent &s;tate; the helps and advantages they have met with, will do thee good, and comfort thee: But what is this to tho&s;e that are not in the way, that have not faith in the way? Tho' they have a clear belief of the doctrine and way it&s;elf, yet they are not exerci&s;ing them|&s;elves to walk therein; for they do but as the re&s;t of the world, &s;aying, this good man, and the other good man, made a good &s;ermon. Why was it good? Not for any good they found by it, but becau&s;e he rai&s;ed his doctrine well, and proved it from the &s;cripture, therefore we are obliged to believe it.</P>
<P>But now this good doctrine, if it be ever &s;o good, and ever &s;o firmly proved, it brings forth no fruit to the amend|ment of life, &s;aving in them that believe, &s;aving in them where there is an exerci&s;e in the fear of God, where peo|ple are concerned for their &s;oul's &s;atisfaction. For they that look for true &s;atisfaction by this, or that, or the other way of the world, they &s;pend their days without &s;atisfac|tion, and &s;o at la&s;t they die in &s;orrow; and &s;o it will be to the end of this, and all &s;ucceeding generations.</P>
<P>And therefore, my friends, though I confe&s;s it is not a grief to me, but a joy, to &s;ee people willing to hear the truth, and to come together in great a&s;&s;emblies; tho I &s;ay, this is not a grief, but a joy, for I am not about to di&s;cou|rage them that do &s;o: Yet I mu&s;t be plain with you; I know what I &s;ay, and you will know it too one day, that all this meeting together, and gathering in great a&s;|&s;emblies, and hearing what is preached to you, with ever &s;o great delight to your minds, it will do you no good,
<PB N="359" REF="020309_0359_0FAEF8961BBD7C78">
unle&s;s you believe in the grace of God, that hath been mini&s;tered to you through Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>And when people come to this foundation, and build on it, and grow every day more and more diligent in the exerci&s;e of their minds towards God, and examine their way, and examine their foot&s;teps, how they have walked ye&s;terday, how they have walked this day, and how their minds are exerci&s;ed at this pre&s;ent time, whether they have an&s;wered the grace of God; when they come to be thus exerci&s;ed, they will look upon them&s;elves as bound in duty to give account to God every moment, for their thoughts, words and actions. When they are thus exerci&s;ed, then let them come to meetings in the name of God, and hear the experiences of them that have gone before them, and trea&s;ured up &s;ayings in their hearts for their encourage|ment, and they will find this will be a help to them: But if people go and build a religion upon the &s;ay|ings of this and that man; nay, were it upon the &s;ayings of Chri&s;t him&s;elf and his apo&s;tles, if they were here to preach to them, and build a religion upon their words, and &s;ay|ings, and doctrines, without the operations of the Spirit of God upon their hearts, inclining them to holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, this religion will do them no good: By this, to make the be&s;t of it, they might make a &s;hift to reach to a form of godline&s;s; people conforming them&s;elves out|wardly, to the outward precept or command from with|out, it might amount to a form of godline&s;s; yet it might be &s;uppo&s;ed and granted, that the power of God, the pow|er of divine life and virtue, where it comes, it doth &s;anc|tify and &s;ea&s;on the mind, and bring men into an awful reverence of the living God, their Maker, that they might &s;tand in awe, and not &s;in again&s;t him; for here is the life of religion.</P>
<P>This hath a great difference from the manner of building men in religion, that many have been acquainted withal. They tell us, our fathers before us were built up in the&s;e forms, and modes, and methods of religion; they received &s;o many doctrines, ordinances, &s;acraments and articles; and when the&s;e are received, believed and profe&s;&s;ed, there's a &s;aint for you, there's a child of God, and a member of

the church. How came he to be &s;o? He was in&s;tructed in all the principles of the Chri&s;tian religion, and &s;ubject to all the ordinances of the church, &s;aith one; and &s;aith another, he could &s;peak excellently concerning the doctrine of our religion; therefore he is certainly a child of God, and a member of Chri&s;t; but all this acceptation of the principles of the Chri&s;tian religion, of doctrines, and ordi|nances, and &s;acraments; all this will not amount to the purifying of the heart, and clean&s;ing and purging of the con&s;cience; nay, it would not come to a far le&s;s matter, to the bridling of the tongue; but they would be in a pa&s;&s;ion upon the lea&s;t provocation, and upon the lea&s;t di&s;|gu&s;t and di&s;ta&s;te given them, their tongues would run over into wrath, and into wantonne&s;s, and prophanene&s;s; and upon any occa&s;ion and provocation given, their corrupted words would prevail, and lead them into deceit and co|vetous practices; and though the fruits and works of the old man remain, yet they will follow the principle of the regenerate, as far as they con&s;i&s;t in words.</P>
<P>If our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;ay, <HI>except a man be born again he cannot enter into the kingdom of God,</HI> then this old corrupt birth will preach a &s;ermon upon this text, and profe&s;s it. How many have taken upon them to preach a &s;ermon, upon &s;ome excellent &s;ayings of Chri&s;t, that never knew what regeneration was; for the <HI>new birth</HI> al|ways hath a <HI>new life;</HI> but they have lived the life of car|nal corrupt fallen man, and yet preach a &s;ermon upon regeneration: Thus the mini&s;ter hath done, and the peo|ple have believed him, and have been gathered into &s;uch and &s;uch a church; for mo&s;t put them&s;elves into one church or other; they have been covenanted Chri&s;tians, members of a church; but they have wanted that which makes a Chri&s;tian, a religious man, <HI>viz. the an&s;wer of a good con&s;cience.</HI></P>
<P>A true Chri&s;tian, he is bound to be an obedient child unto God, that begat him of his own will, by the word of truth; and &s;uch a one may be in expectation of an an|&s;wer of peace from God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in whom he hath believed, and by whom he is reconciled to God. If you take away this new birth, and this new nature,
<PB N="361" REF="020309_0361_0FAEF899138519D0">
and an an&s;wer of peace, from God to the &s;oul, then tell me what the Chri&s;tian religion is, more than the religion of <HI>Heathens</HI> and <HI>Pagans,</HI> that wor&s;hip &s;tocks and &s;tones? All the re&s;t is but talk, and men are never a whit the better for it: One man may excel another in talk and di&s;|cour&s;e: A debauched man many times hath been able to talk at a great rate, and to &s;peak notable things; and &s;ome have been ready to &s;ay, it is a pity a man of &s;uch ex|cellent parts &s;hould lead a wicked life: But alas! if &s;uch a one can talk of the power of God &s;till, and the devil hath power over him; or if he &s;peak highly of the wi&s;|dom of God, yet he him&s;elf plays the fool abominably; &s;o that by &s;uch a kind of life, and &s;uch a kind of reli|gion, people never attain to &s;atisfaction; after forty, or fifty, or &s;ixty years &s;pent therein, they mu&s;t after all, lay down their heads in &s;orrow, when they have been con|&s;tant keepers to the church, and &s;ayers of their prayers, and receivers of the &s;acrament, and &s;tedfa&s;tly believe the articles of the creed, and make profe&s;&s;ion of all the parts of the Chri&s;tian religion; yet after all, they mu&s;t lay down their heads in &s;orrow: Why, what is the matter? what did they want? They wanted faith in the power of God, that &s;hould enable them to overcome their &s;in, and live in obedience to God; and they wanted to their outward profe&s;&s;ion, the <HI>an&s;wer of a good con&s;cience, and ju&s;tification through Chri&s;t the Mediator.</HI></P>
<P>They talked of redemption through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but were never redeemed from their &s;ins: This is &s;o evident and plain, that there is no &s;peaking to the contrary: If you &s;ee a drunkard, or a &s;wearer, or an unclean per&s;on, and if he &s;hall preach, and make an excellent &s;ermon of the redemption that there is in Chri&s;t, and therein tell you, what great benefits they receive by Chri&s;t, that are true believers; and that Chri&s;t is a Redeemer, and redeemeth them from the cur&s;e of the law, and from the guilt of &s;in, and reconcileth them to God; &s;o that he that was under the cur&s;e of the law, and an heir of wrath, is now a child of God: Now if you come to examine this man, and ask him, whether he is redeemed, and delivered from &s;in, &s;o that &s;in hath no more dominion over him, he will
<PB N="362" REF="020309_0362_0FAEF899D3862758">
tell you, no: What not redeemed, when thou ha&s;t been a be|liever thus long? Art thou &s;till under the bondage and cap|tivity of &s;in? Then thou art under the government of &s;ome other ma&s;ter than Chri&s;t; &s;ome other ma&s;ter hath rule over thee, if thou art not redeemed from thy &s;wearing, lying, drun|kenne&s;s, and uncleanne&s;s; if thou art led to the&s;e things, thou are under the power and government of &s;ome other ma&s;ter than Chri&s;t. Now this hath &s;tartled people, when they have been thinking, that they have been baptized per&s;ons, and profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians, and they have flattered them&s;elves with a groundle&s;s confidence, let me die when I will, this night, or to morrow, I &s;hall be &s;aved by Chri&s;t; I am an heir of the kingdom of God: Let me tell thee, thou di&s;honoure&s;t the name of God by thy pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>When people come to examine matters, and read over the book of their con&s;ciences, and &s;ee what &s;ervants they have been to the devil, how the devil hath led them up and down at his will, tho&s;e that were covenanted Chri&s;tians, followers of Chri&s;t; when the devil hath &s;aid to them, follow me, then &s;aye&s;t thou I will; when the devil &s;aith, follow me to this and the other evil thing, I &s;ee I cannot re&s;i&s;t; I cannot with&s;tand the temptation; I was overtaken, and &s;urpri&s;ed, and led away by &s;uch an allurement, and en|&s;nared by it: I pray thee leave off profe&s;&s;ing, for thou di&s;|grace&s;t the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; he and his di&s;ciples did not &s;o: He was tempted as thou art, and his di&s;ciples were tempted as thou art; &s;o were Chri&s;tians of old time; and Chri&s;tians that live in the pre&s;ent time do meet with many temptations, but they are not at the devil's beck and call, as thou art.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> in one pa&s;&s;age of his life, we find came to be awakened and &s;tartled: There was a light from <HI>Heaven</HI> &s;hone about him, he heard the voice of Chri&s;t &s;peaking to him, <HI>Saul, Saul, why per&s;ecute&s;t thou me?</HI> and he &s;aid, <HI>who art thou Lord?</HI> and the Lord &s;aid, <HI>I am JESUS whom thou per&s;ecute&s;t; it is hard for thee to kick again&s;t the pricks;</HI> and he trembling and a&s;toni&s;hed &s;aid, <HI>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</HI> Acts, ix. 4. He was brought to this pa&s;s after his convincement, but before that he was overcome and led captive; and when he would do good,
<PB N="363" REF="020309_0363_0FAEF89BB0A1B500">
evil was pre&s;ent with him: <HI>To will,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>is pre&s;ent, but how to perform I know not;</HI> but he did not call this a happy &s;tate. He did not &s;ay then, I am in a good condition, When I am led captive by the devil at his will: The good that I would do, I do not, and I am carnal, and &s;old under &s;in: He doth not &s;ay, this is a good con|dition, I am &s;atisfied with it; &s;ee what he calls that con|dition; he gives it a more right name than many do now-a-days, that &s;ay, this is the &s;tate of God's children; that the be&s;t of all God's children have not power to live with|out &s;in, and overcome all their corruptions, that they &s;in in their be&s;t duties, and can do nothing but &s;in, and that &s;in mixeth it&s;elf in all their holy duties and performances: Many of their mini&s;ters tell them, that if they think they can perform any duty without &s;in, they deceive them&s;elves, and run the hazard of being accur&s;ed. But they learned not this of Chri&s;t, but of &s;ome other matter. Paul gave this &s;tate another name; I would you were as wi&s;e when you are in this &s;tate and condition. <HI>O wretched man that I am, who &s;hall deliver me?</HI> I &s;ee a wretchedne&s;s in this con|dition; I &s;ee, if I be not delivered out of it, I mu&s;t peri&s;h to all eternity. This is not a &s;tate to live in; who can live at ea&s;e in &s;uch a condition as this? Who can but cry out, who &s;hall deliver me from this body of &s;in and death? Alas! we hear no &s;uch cry now among prie&s;ts or people, and &s;eparate congregations: I fear this cry is al|mo&s;t lo&s;t among us, unle&s;s it be &s;ome few that hear the voice of God, and feel &s;uch a &s;troke of the divine power as <HI>Paul</HI> did, and an&s;wer to the heavenly voice. I confe&s;s that I my&s;elf have heard &s;uch a cry, and have been &s;en&s;ible of my woful captivity and bondage, by rea&s;on of &s;in. And though I had a mind to do good, I could not do it; it was my de&s;ire that I might &s;in no more, I would not &s;in again&s;t the Lord, if I could avoid it; and when I would do good, I found that evil was pre&s;ent with me; but I was far from &s;itting down there, and &s;aying, this is the &s;tate and condition of God's people; it is as well with me as it was with the apo&s;tle Paul, therefore I will &s;it down in this &s;tate: The people of God cannot find &s;atisfaction in &s;uch a &s;tate as this; though I confe&s;s, that God's peculiar

people at fir&s;t: came to this &s;tate, for their conviction; and the opening of their minds, and enlightening their under|&s;tandings, to &s;ee the evil of their ways; but they do not come to this &s;tate, as to their re&s;t, and then per&s;uade them|&s;elves that they are in the condition of the children of God; but they give their &s;tate a right name, and cry out, <HI>O wretched wan that I am!</HI> what a mi&s;erable condition am I fallen into! I did not &s;ee it before: Now my eyes are opened, now my under&s;tanding is illuminated, now I &s;ee that the corruption of my nature prevails again&s;t the grace of God; and when I would join with the grace of God, and the motions of his Holy Spirit, the enemy is pre&s;ent to lead me away; I am not now in a happy &s;tate, but I am &s;o far advanced that I am convinced of my mi&s;erable and wretched &s;tate and condition; if &s;ome way or other be not found for my deliverance, I &s;hall never &s;ee the face of God with comfort. Then ari&s;es that cry, <HI>who &s;hall deliver me?</HI> Thus the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul (Rom.</HI> vii.) &s;ets forth the &s;tate of his convincement, and how mi&s;erable a condition he was in: Then he goes further, and tells you how it was with him: <HI>I thank God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</HI> O! I have cau&s;e enough to thank God, I am not a wretched man now, I am not carnal, &s;old under &s;in; I am not led cap|tive by the devil at his will now. Why how &s;o? the apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>the law of the &s;pirit of life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, hath &s;et me free from the law of &s;in and death.</HI> Here is &s;omething to glory, and to comfort the &s;oul in: The law of the Spirit of life triumphed in his &s;oul, and delivered him from the law of &s;in and death, and redeemed him from the power of &s;in, and made him &s;erve God with freedom and liberty. <HI>I thank God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord:</HI> I would have all come to this, to thank God; not only in words, but in reality, in deed and truth. For one may teach a <HI>parrot</HI> to talk over the&s;e words; but it is the law of the &s;pirit of life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, that will make you free from the law of &s;in and death.</P>
<P>This is a hard le&s;&s;on, therefore you mu&s;t go home into your own con&s;ciences, before you can make a right judg|ment of things, and give a right an&s;wer to your&s;elves. The law of the &s;pirit of life will &s;et thee free from the
<PB N="365" REF="020309_0365_0FAEF89CD9DC77D8">
law of thy pa&s;&s;ion, and of thy pride and covetou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;en&s;uality, and the law of thy carnal inclinations. Art thou &s;et free from the&s;e?</P>
<P>Now when people come to examine them&s;elves, they have no way to flee to, but they mu&s;t take up a daily cro&s;s, and tru&s;t to the Lord Je&s;us for their deliverance; who hath enlightened them, to &s;ee their wretched and woful &s;tate; and illuminated their under&s;tandings, that they might come to him, in order to their being delivered from the dominion of &s;in.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the world think this is a thing im|po&s;&s;ible, and therefore do not hope to be &s;et free from the bondage of their &s;ins. Which of the&s;e ways is it that thou take&s;t? I am afraid many of you have taken the wrong way: I judge no one in particular, but I &s;peak this in faithfulne&s;s and love to your &s;ouls.</P>
<P>If there be any <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, that are &s;en&s;ible of their &s;ins, and in a captivated &s;tate under &s;in and &s;atan, who have de&s;pair|ed of ever being for at liberty, and have &s;aid, it is a vain thing to expect it; for &s;ome learned men have told them, that there is no deliverance from &s;in in this world, there|fore it is in vain for me to &s;trive, in vain for me to en|gage my&s;elf in a continual care and conflict, in a con|tinual warring and watching again&s;t &s;in; for this deliver|ance can never be obtained in this life: It is in vain to &s;eek for a thing that can never be found, and to &s;trive for that which can never be obtained. If there be any &s;uch here pre&s;ent, I have this to &s;ay to them, that the Lord, in his infinite mercy, hath done two great things for you, to help you out of this de&s;pair, of obtaining a full deliver|ance from the bondage of your &s;ins.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, God hath placed a witness for him&s;elf in your bo|&s;oms, in your con&s;ciences. Let me ask you, have ye not got victory over many &s;ins and temptations, that you have been a&s;&s;aulted with, from your childhood to this day? I might challenge any per&s;on in this a&s;&s;embly, when a temptati|on hath been pre&s;ented before you, hath there not been &s;omething within you, to tell you of the danger of com|plying with it? Hath not thy con&s;cience warned thee, and called upon thee, O take heed, do not this evil thing, do
<PB N="366" REF="020309_0366_0FAEF89D986F95B0">
not cheat thy neighbour, do not commit this &s;in; whe|ther drunkenne&s;s, or uncleanne&s;s, or what&s;oever &s;in thou wa&s;t tempted to: Now, did&s;t thou join to that voice in thine own con&s;cience? And did it not help thee over the temptation? And when thou did&s;t e&s;cape the &s;in, wa&s;t thou not glad of it? and did&s;t thou not rejoice that thou obtained&s;t victory over it? Satan laid a &s;nare, and an opportunity before me, to commit &s;uch a &s;in; but I did not join with it, and now I am glad of it. It was not only the devil's fault, for he came to his own, but there was an evil inclination in my heart to it: How came it to pa&s;s thou did&s;t not do it? I knew it was a &s;in again&s;t the Lord. How did&s;t thou know that? I knew in my con&s;cience, that if I did it, I mu&s;t &s;in again&s;t light, and again&s;t conviction, and again&s;t grace received; and that was the rea&s;on I did not do it. Thus thou acknowledge&s;t thine own con&s;cience help|ed thee again&s;t the temptation.</P>
<P>Now I appeal to all your con&s;ciences, that hear me this day, whether God hath not done this kindne&s;s for you; and there is none here but hath been &s;ome time helped out of temptation? I do not believe that ill of any, that they comply with all the temptations they meet with, but the light in their con&s;ciences hath &s;hewn them the evil of &s;in, and they have been kept out of it, and they have been glad of it afterwards.</P>
<P>Now this is one great kindne&s;s, which God hath done for every one of you, in order to help you out of this de&s;pair of being delivered from your &s;ins.</P>
<P>De&s;pair in the common notion of it, is that which makes a man doubt of his eternal &s;alvation: <HI>I &s;hall go to hell when I die; there is no mercy for me.</HI> This de&s;pair hath &s;o wrought upon people, that many have lo&s;t their wits, and common &s;en&s;e, and at la&s;t made away with them&s;elves; many have been di&s;tracted and undone in this world, while they lived in it, and at la&s;t have di&s;patched them&s;elves out of it. And there is another de&s;pair; a de&s;pair of getting vic|tory over their corruptions, and obtaining a freedom from &s;in: This latter de&s;pair, this nation is generally fallen into; though the effects of the other de&s;pair is lamentable to be|hold, the effects of this will be as bad one day, if not
<PB N="367" REF="020309_0367_0FAEF89EA2923C28">
prevented by rectifying that mi&s;take men lie under. Why &s;houlde&s;t thou de&s;pair of the power of God to help thee, and of the grace of God, and of the good will of God for thy de|liverance? if thou wilt not join with the grace of God, and the power of God that is ready to help thee, and give deliverance from thy &s;ins, the con&s;equence will be dreadful at the la&s;t. Therefore believe in that grace of God, which hath helped thee again&s;t &s;ome temptations, and given thee victory over &s;ome &s;ins, that it will, if thou faithfully join with it, give thee victory over all.</P>
<P>Secondly, Con&s;ider God hath done another kindne&s;s for thee, he hath &s;ent his <HI>light and truth</HI> into thy heart, to en|gage thee in a war again&s;t &s;in: There are a great many faithful &s;oldiers of Chri&s;t, that have fought this battle be|fore you, and have obtained the <HI>victory,</HI> and they will tell you, they never went out to war in their own names, but in the name of the <HI>Lord</HI> JEHOVAH: When they relied upon him, and in meekne&s;s and fear waited upon him, he gave them power to overcome; and they were made con|querors, and <HI>more than conquerors;</HI> for they have overcome tho&s;e enemies, that &s;ometimes overcame them; and Chri&s;t hath fixed and &s;ettled them in this conque&s;t, never to be over|come more. Here is both an outward and an inward evi|dence: The outward evidence will do you no good, till you come to lay hold of the inward evidence in your own hearts; then the outward evidence that God &s;ends, will be &s;erviceable to you.</P>
<P>Therefore, my friends, I tell you (as I &s;aid before) no|thing will &s;atisfy the &s;oul, but the virtue and life that flows into it from the fountain of life; here is the way to it. If you &s;hould hear of a trea&s;ury, and &s;tore of bread laid up for all that are willing to come to it; if you knew not the way to come to it, and were ready to peri&s;h with hunger, what a cry would there be among you! If a man &s;hould come and tell you where there is &s;uch a <HI>trea&s;ury of bread,</HI> when you are ready to peri&s;h with hunger, and tell you the way to it is intricate and narrow, but that he him&s;elf hath been there, and that he can tell you the ready way to it, and that he him&s;elf had relief and &s;up|ply, and great plenty be&s;towed upon him, and that he
<PB N="368" REF="020309_0368_0FAEF89F14C74660">
would bring you thither, O how welcome would &s;uch a one be to you! O that you were as wi&s;e in &s;piritual things, and as much concerned for your &s;ouls, as you are for your bodies, and would take the advice of Gods mini&s;ters! They would turn you to the light within; the grace of God in your own hearts, which you are partakers of; and &s;peak|ing to you in the name of God, de&s;ire you to follow the duties of your own con&s;ciences, and you will come quickly where there is bread enough. By that light within, you will &s;ee your &s;tate is not &s;o good as you imagined it was. This <HI>oracle</HI> within, is that which you mu&s;t live with, and dwell with; you mu&s;t go home with it, and lie down with it, and you mu&s;t ri&s;e with it, and follow the dictates of it; if you do &s;o, before the week be out, you will have ex|perience to tell me, if I &s;hould come and ask you, I have got more victory over my &s;ins, by following the dictates of the light of the grace of God within my own bo&s;om, than by all my reading, hearing and praying, and per|forming other duties.</P>
<P>Make a trial of this, and you will find the pre&s;ence of God with you, and that he is a God at hand, and not afar off; and if you buckle on your &s;piritual armour, the cap|tain of your &s;alvation will not be far off, but be pre&s;ent before you.</P>
<P>Therefore keep your eye unto Je&s;us, the author and fi|ni&s;her of your faith, and you will be <HI>able to do all things through Chri&s;t that &s;trengthens you;</HI> and you will be able to conquer tho&s;e &s;ins and temptations that have conquered you.</P>
<P>May the law of the &s;pirit of life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, break down the body of &s;in and death, and bring you into the glorious liberty which God hath prepared for his chil|dren.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SERMON XXXII. CHRISTIANS</HI> &s;hould often think on the <HI>NAME</HI> of the <HI>LORD.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Preached at DEVONSHIRE-HOUSE, <DATE>July 17, 1692.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>THE people of God in former ages, did <HI>often think upon the name of the Lord:</HI> I would it might be the daily practice of all that make profe&s;&s;ion to be the people of God in our days, to think <HI>often</HI> upon the name of the Lord. This you know is an inward exerci&s;e, in|vi&s;ible and known to none but God; he only knows when you are met together, whether you are thinking up|on his name, whether the exerci&s;e of your minds is up|on his power, or upon what&s;oever el&s;e your minds are en|gaged. They who&s;e exerci&s;e and de&s;ire is, to feel God's power, and to be acquainted with his name, the Lord is nigh to them, to reveal his mighty power, and his name to them, and they are a people that partake of his goodne&s;s and of his virtue, and have an experimental knowledge of the divers admini&s;trations of both his judgments and mer|cies to their own &s;ouls, and &s;o they can proceed from thinking to &s;peaking of the goodne&s;s of God from the ex|perience that they have in them&s;elves, that the Lord is good to them.</P>
<P>For all that &s;ome do in their manner of &s;peaking of God and his goodne&s;s, and crying up the name of the Lord, it is all worth nothing, it is but noi&s;e: But every one that partakes in his own &s;oul of &s;omething of the divine virtue and goodne&s;s that flows from God invi&s;ibly to him through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, he hath a&s;&s;urance in him&s;elf that he &s;peaks the truth: It is not meer words, made ready to his hand, but it is his own knowledge and experience of that which God hath wrought in him by his own Spirit; there are none that think upon the name of the Lord, and his power, and the working of it, but they are able to &s;peak of it effectually and truly.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="020309_0370_0FAEF8A0AB401520">I know it hath been, and is the practice among many, that they are able to &s;peak of God's goodne&s;s from what they find in the writings and &s;ayings of &s;ome that lived before them, that did bear an honourable te&s;timony of God's goodne&s;s in their religion; and they learn to &s;ay it over again in their particular age: But what hath this tale that they have told, wrought? This report they have made, how God was with the Chri&s;tians of old, the primitive Chri&s;tians and martyrs; they have told a tale of the&s;e things, and what hath it effected? It hath either brought forth Chri&s;tians, or it hath not.</P>
<P>The way for people to be grounded and &s;ettled in divine knowledge, is for every one to &s;peak what they know: And if they know nothing of the&s;e things, to &s;ay nothing of them. And the way for them to come to receive divine knowledge, is, by thinking, by meditat|ing, by con&s;idering of that conver&s;e that God hath with their own &s;ouls; for there is a way provided for all men to conver&s;e with God that made them: Every man and woman may ask que&s;tions of him, and may have an&s;wers from him, if they have patience enough to wait for them; every &s;oul here pre&s;ent, that with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of mind &s;hall ask of God what their &s;tate and condition is, if they were to die pre&s;ently, God will tell them, he will an|&s;wer them; he will &s;hine unto them by the <HI>light of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and let them know whether they are <HI>in the gall of bitterne&s;s, and in the bonds of their iniquity</HI> &s;till, or whether they are redeemed out of it, and brought into covenant with him&s;elf: But will you believe his an&s;wer? I would have no man go about to ask &s;uch a que&s;tion of God unle&s;s he hath a mind to believe the an&s;wer that God giveth him. To what purpo&s;e &s;hould men ask, if they <HI>ask ami&s;s?</HI> If they ask without faith, they do not believe except the an&s;wer plea&s;e them.</P>
<P>Many, in our days, have put up their petitions and pray|ers to God, that he would di&s;cover to them the &s;tate and condition of their &s;ouls: The Lord hath an&s;wered them, and notwith&s;tanding all the profe&s;&s;ion that they have made of his name, and of their faith in his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and of the work of redemption, yet he hath often declared
<PB N="371" REF="020309_0371_0FAEF8A14C3B0310">
thou art &s;till unredeemed, thou art &s;till in thy &s;in, and lu&s;ts, and concupi&s;cence prevail over thee; thou art &s;till in bondage. This is God's an&s;wer to many; but there is &s;omething ari&s;eth in their minds, that they are not wil|ling to believe this; I would think better of my&s;elf than this: What if thou do&s;t think better of thy&s;elf? Thou art never the better, <HI>for the word of the Lord &s;tands &s;ure.</HI> There is no removing of it; there is no denial of the truth. If this truth condemn thee, all the world cannot ju&s;tify thee; and this truth by which God condemns the &s;inner is in the &s;inner's own heart: What will he do with it? It is in the &s;inner's con&s;cience; it doth not only con|demn him by book, out of this chapter and that ver&s;e, out of this author and the other author, but he is con|demned by God's true and faithful witne&s;s, in his own con&s;cience. Thou wilt not believe it; but if thou be|lieve&s;t not this, then thou remaine&s;t in thy unbelief of the truth; and nothing el&s;e but believing it can &s;ave thee; no coun&s;el el&s;e can deliver or redeem thee.</P>
<P>So that the be&s;t advice and coun&s;el that I can give a people in this ca&s;e, is this; that when they come to &s;uch a religious meeting as this is, they would come with a mind prepared and fitted to think upon the Lord; to think up|on his name, and the way by which he brings people to him&s;elf; for no man can be called a child of God, that doth not partake of his nature. If a man be ever &s;o wi&s;e, and rich, and great in the world; if he be a prince or an emperor, without this he is a <HI>child of wrath.</HI> Now if the&s;e children of wrath meet with &s;omething that convinceth them; if they are touched and become a &s;en&s;ible people, then crowns and diadems are nothing to them. Such a one will &s;ay, if I be a <HI>child of wrath,</HI> a captive to &s;in and my own lu&s;ts and concupi&s;cence, yet for all that I will go to a religious meeting, where I hope the word of God will be preached; I hope to meet with &s;omething there that will do me good; and I have a de&s;ire that I may be tran&s;|lated out of a natural &s;tate, from being <HI>a child of wrath, to be brought into the kingdom of God.</HI> If I have this de|&s;ire in me, God that made me, wrought it in me; for by nature <HI>we cannot &s;o much as think a good thought.</HI> When
<PB N="372" REF="020309_0372_0FAEF8A3348528F0">
men think of being better, and of amending their ways, and doing their &s;ouls good, the&s;e are very good thoughts in them&s;elves. When &s;uch thoughts are begotten in any men's hearts, I would have them to a&s;cribe them to the grace of God, and nothing el&s;e. Preachers may do much where the&s;e de&s;ires are begotten; but it is not in their power to beget the&s;e de&s;ires.</P>
<P>Many have come to a meeting with loo&s;e, prophane and wandering minds; and though many good things have been &s;poken to them, it hath not reached &s;o far as to beget good de&s;ires, their hearts have been &s;o alienated from the grace of God in them&s;elves, which is the great &s;uperior worker, to which we are but &s;ervants and mini&s;ters; there is none can beget any thing, but he in whom all power is. They that are under the power of darkne&s;s, the de|vil begets in them wantonne&s;s and vanity, prophanene&s;s and hardne&s;s of heart. Some go away from a meeting without being touched and per&s;uaded, and they have no good hope of being better: But where people are really touched in their &s;pirits, with a de&s;ire after &s;omething that will do them good, they mu&s;t come to the fountain of good, the God that made them, and they mu&s;t think upon him; if they cannot <HI>&s;ee his glory, and hear his voice,</HI> yet they can think upon him. This is the lea&s;t duty of a Chri&s;tian, to <HI>think upon the name of the Lord,</HI> when their minds are exerci&s;ed about divine matters, about the &s;tate and con|dition of their poor &s;ouls. If I die this night, what will become of me? This and that &s;in I have committed; how &s;hall I be able to an&s;wer to God for one of a thou&s;and of all my loo&s;e thoughts, words and actions? They that come to a con&s;ideration of this, and a due &s;en&s;e of their &s;tate and condition, though it is &s;uch a &s;tate that they do not like; though it is not &s;uch as it ought to be, yet notwith&s;tanding it may be better; they may be brought out of it into a better condition.</P>
<P>Now this is the duty of all, to wait upon God, the foun|tain of all good, that they may receive &s;omething from God, for <HI>every good and perfect gift comes from above, from the Father of lights,</HI> the Father of thy light and my light, that light comes to us from the Father of lights: If
<PB N="373" REF="020309_0373_0FAEF8A430313820">
we have any perfect gift be&s;towed upon us, it is be&s;towed by God; therefore you will grant that we are all obliged, from the greate&s;t to the lea&s;t, to wait upon him, if we have the lea&s;t expectation from God, by meeting, otherwi&s;e we had better keep away.</P>
<P>But I am apt to judge that the mo&s;t here are come with &s;ome de&s;ire, that if it plea&s;e God they may receive benefit by their meeting: Where &s;hall they have it? They &s;ay, if &s;uch a man preacheth, then I can edify much by him: This is a great mi&s;take; for, let who will preach, there is nobody can receive any benefit, but it mu&s;t be from the Lord, as the fountain of good; for the be&s;t preachers in the world are but in&s;truments in the hands of God; if God doth not ble&s;s his labours, the preacher can do nothing to the &s;ouls of people; he can &s;ound the truth in their ears out|wardly, but he can reach no further, God only &s;peaks to the heart. If thou mind the preacher and not God that made thee, all his preaching will do thee no good; it may indeed help thee to a notion or &s;peculation, but that comes not to the in&s;ide, that will be no better, the in&s;ide wants mending.</P>
<P>There are great deformities, &s;cars, &s;pots, &s;tains, wounds and lamene&s;s upon the &s;ouls of men, by rea&s;on of their &s;ins, lu&s;ts and corruptions; and there wants a remedy, and there is no phy&s;ician of value but God that made us after his own image. The devil hath brought in deformity, he hath made one proud, another cruel, another wanton, another an oppre&s;&s;or, another malicious; this is all the devil's work: <HI>And for this end Chri&s;t Je&s;us came into the world, that he might de&s;troy the works of the devil.</HI> He came to de&s;troy pride, malice and lu&s;t; the&s;e are the devil's works, that Chri&s;t came to de&s;troy: Why doth he not do it? He will de&s;troy all the devil hath wrought in every man that will be &s;ubject to him: Can a chirurgeon &s;et a bone, if the patient be not &s;ubject to his hand?</P>
<P>But this is far beyond all compari&s;on; Chri&s;t hath <HI>re|ceived all power in Heaven and Earth,</HI> yet he always looks for a willing people; he &s;ends the day of his power up|on a people, and he worketh upon their hearts by an invin|cible power; he makes them willing to be helped, and
<PB N="374" REF="020309_0374_0FAEF8A4553D06E8">
and healed, and cured, and then he cures them. I dare &s;ay, there is not one here that is willing to be re|formed, and to &s;ubmit to Chri&s;t to be &s;aved and redeemed by him, but he will do it; <HI>he that is willing and obedient, &s;hall eat of the good of the land,</HI> and &s;hall know the good of redemption. See whether it be come to a &s;tate of re|demption; here is univer&s;al grace offered; for the <HI>light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us enlighteneth every one of you;</HI> it &s;hews you your lo&s;t &s;tate and condition: When we &s;ee our condition bad, that it is not as it ought to be, who would not have it better?</P>
<P>What means prayer, that Chri&s;tian duty? What &s;hall we pray for? Mu&s;t not people be &s;en&s;ible in them&s;elves what they &s;hould pray for, before they come to pray? And what is it that will make them &s;en&s;ible but the light and grace of God? They &s;ee their own wants when God worketh faith in their hearts, and they believe that God can &s;upply tho&s;e wants. Why &s;hould I go to a beggar, to pray him to give me an hundred pounds? I believe he cannot do it, therefore I will not pray to him for it: Now nece&s;&s;ity brings people to prayer, but there mu&s;t be faith in him to whom we pray, that he is able to &s;upply our wants, and relieve our nece&s;&s;ities. Upon this account the apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>he that cometh to God mu&s;t believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently &s;eek him.</HI> He mu&s;t fir&s;t know that there is a God to come unto, and then that he is a rewarder.</P>
<P>Here is the foundation of all true religion and true wor|&s;hip; they that go to God and &s;ay their prayers, and join with others in &s;aying their prayers, if they have no &s;en&s;e of God, they had as good hold their tongues, for their pray|ing is to no purpo&s;e: They that pretend to believe in God, without an experimental power of God working upon their hearts, their belief is not worth a &s;traw; without their re|&s;pect to the power of God, all their belief is nothing; but if they know that God hath &s;uch an operation upon them, that no man or woman in the world can di&s;cover that to them, that God di&s;covereth, then they know that God is <HI>the &s;earcher of hearts and the trier of the reins,</HI> Jere|miah, xvii. 10.</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="020309_0375_0FAEF8A514F74B58">Suppo&s;e I know that there is a God, and at the &s;ame time I believe that he will never hear me; that I am a re|probate creature, and that he hath ca&s;t me off forever, and that he hath &s;ealed condemnation upon me, to all eternity. What rea&s;on hath &s;uch a one to pray? This is a de&s;perate condition. But while we believe there is a God, and that <HI>he is a rewarder of them that diligently &s;eek him,</HI> it is not in vain to pray; yet there is &s;omething antecedent too to prayer; there is knowledge, and faith by rea&s;on of that know|ledge, that God is a rewarder: He that hath this, let him pray in God's name. But what mu&s;t he pray for? He mu&s;t <HI>not offer the &s;acrifice of fools;</HI> he mu&s;t have regard to his lips; if it be mental prayer, he mu&s;t pray for that he &s;tands in need of; it is for &s;omething he prays, that God hath revealed by his Holy Spirit; this he &s;tands in need of; it is &s;omething that he needs; it is power to over|come corruption, and power overcome temptation, that he &s;tands in need of; he &s;tands in need of a Mediator to procure for him the pardon of his &s;ins: The&s;e things he &s;tands in need of, then let him pray; <HI>he that is afflicted, let him pray.</HI></P>
<P>So that if a man or woman go to prayer, they mu&s;t pray to God, in the belief of his goodne&s;s and mercy, that he will be&s;tow &s;ome ble&s;&s;ing upon them, that may be for the better, that may be for their good. When they come to a meeting, to wor&s;hip God, and hear the word &s;poken outwardly, they mu&s;t pray for &s;omething that may be for their good; Lord give me &s;omething that may &s;upport my &s;oul, and &s;omething that may enable me to with&s;tand temptation. People &s;hould have their minds thus exerci&s;ed, and they &s;hould think upon the name of the Lord according to their particular nece&s;&s;ity; they &s;hould pour out their &s;upplication to the Lord: This is &s;uch wor&s;hip as God looks for, and &s;uch as he is plea&s;ed with; he will deliver tho&s;e that thus pray to him out of temptati|ons, &s;o that they &s;hall not prevail over them: One man's temptation is of one &s;ort, and another's of another &s;ort; but they are all delivered by the grace of God, and help|ed over them, upon their prayer to God; for they find by experience that <HI>he is a God hearing prayers.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="020309_0376_0FAEF8A5D6375120">Now, when we have prayed, what is the next work? It is to wait for an an&s;wer of our prayer. I prayed the other day to God for power to with&s;tand &s;uch a tempta|tion; when that temptation comes again I do expect that God will an&s;wer my prayer. Do&s;t thou &s;o? Then I pray thee have an eye to the &s;ame grace of God that convinc|ed thee, and &s;hewed thee the temptation; and have thy faith exerci&s;ed upon that grace of God, and thou wilt find it &s;ufficient for thee, I will warrant thee: Let the devil come with a temptation ever &s;o &s;uitable and &s;ubtil, keep thine eye upon the grace of God, and it will deliver thee. This was the ca&s;e of <HI>Paul; when a me&s;&s;enger of &s;atan was &s;ent to buffet him, he be&s;ought the Lord thrice:</HI> The temp|tation did attend him, and God gave him an an&s;wer of his prayer; <HI>my grace is &s;ufficient for thee.</HI> As if he had &s;aid, let the devil come with ever &s;o much power he &s;hall never overcome thee.</P>
<P>I &s;peak to tho&s;e that are well skilled in this kind of work, and have met with &s;harp temptations, and &s;ometimes per|haps they have been overcome by them, and at other times they have with&s;tood them: What is the difference; why, one while they are loo&s;e and carele&s;s, and did not pray for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of divine grace; another while they kept clo&s;e to it, and were delivered.</P>
<P>Therefore when you come to meeting, with a de&s;ire to receive benefit from God, with your expectations God|ward, to receive comfort from the hands of the Lord, let your eye be upon him, and the working of his grace in your own hearts, and hearken to that voice that is within you, and it will be more effectual than mine. If you find the work of grace in you to be the &s;ame thing that I &s;peak of, then believe me for the truth's-&s;ake; believe me becau&s;e you find the &s;ame work and te&s;timony within your|&s;elves. And I am per&s;uaded there is no one here, but &s;ometime or other have with&s;tood that temptation which they have met withal. Pray tell me how they did it? Why, the temptation came unto me, and it plea&s;ed God to &s;hew me the evil of it, that it was a bad thing if I yielded to it. How did&s;t thou re&s;i&s;t it? had not the devil a coercive power over thee, to force thee to it, whether
<PB N="377" REF="020309_0377_0FAEF8A698DD8A20">
thou woulde&s;t or not? That God that &s;hewed me the evil of it, delivered me from the evil; I was not judged and condemned in my&s;elf, becau&s;e I found my&s;elf delivered from it; there are none of you, if you would not be lazy and idle, but you might be delivered every day, and have experience in your own &s;ouls, that when the devil comes and tempts, the Lord is at hand to deliver you by his grace and power.</P>
<P>So that the only way for people to be pre&s;erved from &s;in and iniquity, is to have a reverent re&s;pect to that grace of God which they have already received. I would have that vain conceit, that hath long reigned in the world, taken out of your head. When you &s;ee a wicked husband, wife, or child, you &s;ay, if they had grace they would be bet|ter; I &s;ay they have &s;ome degree of grace already; God hath &s;ent forth his grace and truth, to <HI>teach men to deny ungodline&s;s,</HI> &s;o that I would not pray that God would give my husband, wife, or child, or friend grace, but that he would break their hard hearts, that they may &s;ubmit to the grace of God that is already be&s;towed upon them. I be|lieve there is not a per&s;on here that is utterly void of all grace; but they walk not according to it, they trample upon it: For every one being endued with a mea&s;ure of grace, through Chri&s;t, our duty therefore is to have a re|verential regard to the grace of God, that we have received.</P>
<P>What grace have I received from God, may &s;ome &s;ay? I have received &s;o much grace from God (thou maye&s;t truly &s;ay) that I can tell when the devil brings a tempta|tion to me; when he tempts me to uncleanne&s;s, theft, wrath, malice, or to deceive my neighbour, I have &s;o much grace that I can tell I am tempted in &s;uch a re&s;pect; the grace of God &s;hews me this is a temptation of the devil: But the que&s;tion is, whether I am &s;ubject to the grace of God, and love his grace better than the profit or plea&s;ure of a temptation? It comes as a bait, but the devil cannot make me do that which he tempts me to; it is not in the power of all the devils in hell, or of his &s;ervants on earth, to make me do this evil thing: The light of my own con|&s;cience &s;hews it to be a temptation. Now I am free and at my choice, whether I will love the profit and plea&s;ure
<PB N="378" REF="020309_0378_0FAEF8A823C12AF0">
that comes with the temptation more than the grace of God: I believe there is no one that hath been tried by a temptation, but they can &s;ay &s;o: I leave it to him <HI>that &s;earches and tries all your hearts, and knows your thoughts,</HI> to judge whether you joined with the temptation, that you might have the profit and plea&s;ure of it, or joined with his grace, that thereby you might have re&s;i&s;ted the temptation: You that have done the one and the other, tell me which is the be&s;t bargain; when you have joined with the temptation, that you might have the profit and plea&s;ure that came along with it; or when you joined with the grace of God, that &s;hewed you the evil and danger of the temptation. The &s;ame God &s;peaks to you that &s;pake to <HI>Cain, if thou doe&s;t well, &s;halt not thou be accepted? and if thou do&s;t not well, &s;in lies at the door.</HI> If thou ha&s;t yield|ed to a temptation, <HI>&s;in lies at the door,</HI> there is a breach made between God and thy &s;oul.</P>
<P>The &s;ame man at another time, having &s;marted &s;o deeply for it, being judged by his own con&s;cience, when he meets the temptation again, he &s;aith, let the profit or plea&s;ure go where it will, if I yield to this temptation I cannot go to God but as a criminal to a judge; let the profit or plea&s;ure be what it will, I will not join with this temp|tation. Can the devil force thee to comply with this temptation? No, if thou be true to the grace of God in thy own heart, it will make thee able to re&s;i&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t devil in hell. Chri&s;t hath purcha&s;ed for the &s;ons and daugh|ters of men a power to with&s;tand the devil's power, and all his devices and temptations, and you &s;hall obtain vic|tory, and have dominion over them. If you have a mind to grow in this dominion, when the devil comes to tempt you, re&s;i&s;t him, and you &s;hall, through the power of Chri&s;t, be enabled to overcome.</P>
<P>If &s;atan tell thee of the profits and plea&s;ures of this world, remember <HI>that the world pa&s;&s;eth away, and the lu&s;t of it,</HI> but peace with God endures forever: By the grace of God you will be able to overcome the devil and all his angels. This power is given to all that believe and obey the go&s;pel: If you would have benefit by it, you mu&s;t be exerci&s;ed in re&s;i&s;ting of temptation, and have regard to the
<PB N="379" REF="020309_0379_0FAEF8A92D9AD1E8">
grace of God, and the workings of it in your own hearts; and then you will be able to &s;ay, when a temptation comes, promi&s;ing profit and plea&s;ure, <HI>how can I do this great wickedne&s;s, and &s;in again&s;t God?</HI> Turn your eye to God's <HI>favour, which is better than life, and you will be more than conquerors;</HI> you will &s;ay the fear of God &s;eized upon my &s;oul, and the grace of God came to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and was as a bulwark again&s;t temptation. Here prai&s;es will go up to God; here will be occa&s;ion for thee to &s;peak good of his name. Remember what <HI>David</HI> &s;aid; <HI>my &s;oul, prai&s;e the Lord, that hath delivered me from the horrible pit.</HI> Thus <HI>David</HI> and the &s;aints of old prai&s;ed God in their day, and why &s;hould not we? They breathed forth living prai&s;es and thank&s;givings for the deliverances wrought for them; and &s;hall not we do it?</P>
<P>Now this cannot be done without thinking upon his name, the name of that God that made us: Here I live in the world, I live and breathe &s;till, I have health, and &s;trength, and an e&s;tate, how came I by all this? Did I make my&s;elf? No, there is a God that gave me life, and breath, and being; he holds forth the hand of mer|cy to gather me to him&s;elf, and to <HI>redeem me from all in|iquity, that I might &s;erve him without fear, in holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, all the days of my life:</HI> If I believe this, I &s;hall rejoice in him, and love and prai&s;e him, and dai|ly wait upon him for the accompli&s;hment of his work. <HI>He de&s;ireth not the death of &s;inners:</HI> If you believe the Almighty, <HI>it is impo&s;&s;ible for him to lie, all things are po&s;&s;ible</HI> to him except that; he &s;aith, he <HI>would not the death of him that dies:</HI> What would he have then? He would have you <HI>turn and live:</HI> What means doth he u&s;e? What I would have done I would u&s;e means to accompli&s;h it. You would &s;ay, what means hath he not u&s;ed? What is it that God doth more wi&s;h for than that men would repent, <HI>return and live,</HI> and be happy forever? He hath created them, and given them life and breath, and continued his grace to them, that they might have time to prepare for eter|nity; and he hath given his good &s;pirit to in&s;truct them, <HI>but they have rebelled again&s;t him.</HI> He hath &s;ent forth his word, the go&s;pel of &s;alvation, which hath been preach|ed
<PB N="380" REF="020309_0380_0FAEF8A9948111B8">
to them; and <HI>he hath waited to be gracious, and exer|ci&s;ed much patience and long-&s;uffering</HI> towards them; &s;o that I may &s;ay, what means hath he omitted? <HI>He hath planted them as a vineyard, in a very fruitful hill; and he hath fenced it, and gathered out the &s;tones thereof, and planted it with the choice&s;t vine, and built a tower in the mid&s;t of it, and made a wine-pre&s;s therein, and he looked that it &s;hould bring forth grapes, and it brought wild grapes. Judge, I pray you &s;aith the Lord, between me and my vine|yard: What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?</HI></P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding all your unfruitfulne&s;s, the day of your vi&s;itation is continued, the Lord is willing to &s;hew mercy to your &s;ouls. This is all the Lord your God re|quires of you, that you would think upon his name, be|lieve in him and tru&s;t in him, and wait upon him for the operations of his grace in the u&s;e of his ordinances, and your attendance upon them, and hearkening to his voice, and obeying it, and &s;o <HI>to hear that your &s;ouls may live.</HI></P>
<P>I will affirm, that there is none of you here pre&s;ent, whether you be Quakers or no, but you may meet with The divine operations of the power of God in your own hearts, if you will regard it, and when you meet with the&s;e operations and regard them not, I cannot help it; if you will re&s;i&s;t the good things of the Spirit of God, I cannot help it; if you will be of that mind, <HI>always to re&s;i&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t; if as your fathers did &s;o do ye,</HI> then you mu&s;t all peri&s;h, both you and your fathers; there is no e&s;caping but by be|ing &s;ubject to Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and his quickening Spirit; if there be any divine operations that you meet with in your own hearts, let me per&s;uade you to &s;ubmit and have re|gard to them; for I know the devil is near at hand; and when people meet with divine operations in their &s;ouls, that humble them and bring down their pride, and convince them of the danger of their condition, he lies in the way and &s;ugge&s;ts &s;ome poi&s;onous thing that takes off the edge of the&s;e operations, that, they may di&s;like them: It is true, they meet with the convictions of &s;in; but they reckon they have that faith and belief in Chri&s;t, that doth in the &s;ight of God obliterate all their &s;ins that can be laid to
<PB N="381" REF="020309_0381_0FAEF8AA60455E28">
their charge, both pa&s;t and to come. If I would look, &s;ay they, to the divine operation, or any thing wrought in me, it were enough to make me mad; I look wholly to the merits of Chri&s;t; my mind is wholly fixed upon him who is <HI>the author of eternal &s;alvation;</HI> his meritorious &s;ufferings and obedience can obliterate and blot out all my &s;ins.</P>
<P>My friends, I tell you, many a poor &s;oul hath &s;plit upon this rock by undervaluing the divine operations of the Spirit upon their hearts; they make a fal&s;e and wrong applica|tion of the merits of Chri&s;t, which indeed are &s;o great that nobody can overvalue them; but we mu&s;t not make a fal&s;e application of them, <HI>for this purpo&s;e was the Son of God manife&s;ted, that he might de&s;troy the works of the devil;</HI> he takes away the guilt of &s;in, not that you might live in it &s;till: Who&s;oever believeth in Chri&s;t, &s;hall have power over their &s;ins and not be under the dominion and power of &s;in; <HI>&s;in &s;hall not have dominion over you; for you are not under the law, but under grace. But God be thanked, you were the &s;ervants of &s;in; tho' you have obeyed from the heart, the form of doctrine which was delivered you: Being then made free from &s;in, ye became the &s;ervants of righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Rom. vi, 14, 18.</P>
<P>But thou wilt &s;ay, I am guilty of a great deal of &s;in already, what &s;hall become of me for the guilt I have contracted?</P>
<P><HI>If we confe&s;s and for&s;ake our &s;ins, he is faithful and ju&s;t to forgive us our &s;ins, and to clean&s;e us from all un|righteou&s;ne&s;s; and the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t his Son clean|&s;eth us from all &s;in;</HI> 1 John, ix, 9. Here is a true appli|cation of Chri&s;t, his merits and righteou&s;ne&s;s; when there is a confe&s;&s;ing of &s;in to God, and a for&s;aking of it, here is an offering and a &s;acrifice made to God by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t for the expiation of &s;in; he hath by his pre|cious blood purcha&s;ed the pardon of all my &s;ins, <HI>that he might pre&s;ent me to God without &s;pot or blemi&s;h;</HI> here is a true application of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t; but how can I apply it to my&s;elf while I live in &s;in?</P>
<P>Here God's witne&s;s in the con&s;cience of a &s;inner pleads again&s;t the &s;inner; when he endeavours to believe that his guilt is taken away, and all his &s;ins, pa&s;t, pre&s;ent and to come, are pardoned, while he continues to live in &s;in, and &s;in hath yet dominion over him.</P>
<P><PB N="382" REF="020309_0382_0FAEF8AB0838ACE0">Take heed you &s;plit not upon this rock; if you be humble Chri&s;tians, you will <HI>think upon the name of the Lord;</HI> and when ye find the operation of God's power begetting good de&s;ires in you to hate &s;in and love righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, you will then believe; you will then pray to the God of all grace; for the <HI>prayer of the faithful is acceptable to him: The effectual fervent prayer of a righte|ous man avails much,</HI> James v, 16.</P>
<P>Let your &s;upplication therefore be poured forth unto God, to endow you with power and wi&s;dom to &s;ubdue all your &s;piritual enemies, and to conquer your concupi|&s;cence, and the inordinate de&s;ires and affections of your own hearts, that you may take up the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t and fol|low him as your great pattern, and in his name, and by the help and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Holy Spirit, you may know how to overcome all temptations.</P>

<HEAD>His <HI>PRAYER</HI> after <HI>SERMON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MOST glorious Lord God! wonderful is thy great power over all, which thou ha&s;t revealed and made mani|fe&s;t in this thy ble&s;&s;ed day. Thy arm, O thou Almighty God! is &s;tretched forth; thou ha&s;t touched a remnant with a &s;en&s;e of thy divine love, whom thou ha&s;t gathered unto thy name; thou ha&s;t revealed thy great &s;alvation, and there|with thou ha&s;t made glad the &s;ouls of thy children; thou ha&s;t endeared thy&s;elf unto us by the di&s;covery and manife&s;|tation of thy abounding love, who did&s;t love us, when we were &s;trangers, and did&s;t pre&s;erve us when we were enemies, and brought a glorious day of vi&s;itation upon us, and opened our eyes to behold the light thereof, &s;o that we were a people engaged to &s;peak good of thy name. Thou ha&s;t declared and manife&s;ted to the &s;ons and daughters of men thy good will, and thy univer&s;al grace that thou art daily extending to them, that all may be made partakers of the riches of thy hou&s;e, and of thy great &s;alvation which by the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t thou ha&s;t ordained.</P>
<P>And, O thou powerful God of Life: &s;ince the day that thou fir&s;t gathered us, thou ha&s;t been with us, thou ha&s;t been our guide, and our eyes have been towards thee for in&s;truction, thou ha&s;t taught us and led us in the way in which thou woulde&s;t have us to walk; thou ha&s;t led us, O Lord, in the way everla&s;ting with the poor, the humble and the meek of the earth; and thou ha&s;t placed our feet, O Lord, near the everla&s;ting mountain, which thou ha&s;t exalted upon the high kills of the earth, and thou ha&s;t revealed the glory and the &s;plendor of thy hou&s;e, thy holy dwelling place, and ha&s;t rai&s;ed breathings in the hearts of thy people, that they may dwell in thy courts forever: And now, Holy Father! thou ha&s;t gathered a remnant, and brought a peculiar people to tru&s;t in thy name; but &s;till we do all that we do by thee; thou mu&s;t be our keeper, thou mu&s;t be our pre&s;erver, therefore we wait upon thee; we expect all from thy hand, therefore our applications are unto thee, that from day to day, and from time to time, we may find thy living pre&s;ence in the mid&s;t of us.</P>
<P>And, O living God of Life! thou ha&s;t given thy children large experience that thou art a God nigh at hand to us, in
<PB N="384" REF="020309_0384_0FAEF8AED344E838">
all our trials, in all our exerci&s;es; as our eyes have been turned to thee, thou ha&s;t pre&s;erved us, and revealed thy heavenly power, O Lord, in pre&s;erving and delivering thy church and people, that they may bear a te&s;timony in their generation for thy great love, and the great &s;alvation that thou ha&s;t wrought for them and made them partakers of.</P>
<P>Now ble&s;&s;ed God of Life! the de&s;ires and &s;upplications of thy people are unto thee, for the glorifying of thy power, and the exalting of thy glorious name.</P>
<P>O Lord! let the mighty operation of thy power bow down all &s;tout and &s;tubborn ones, that have rebelled again&s;t thee, and that have with&s;tood the tenders of thy grace, and the motions and &s;trivings of thy Holy Spirit: Thou art able to bow them, and to break their &s;tony hearts; thou art able to &s;peak effectually to their &s;ouls, and to make them &s;ubmit them&s;elves to thee.</P>
<P>Holy and living Father! let the progre&s;s of thy word and go&s;pel be great in our day; let it have a free cour&s;e and &s;pread it&s;elf mightily to tho&s;e that believe not, to beget a feed of faith in their &s;ouls, that they may believe in thy name, and tru&s;t in thy power, and wait to &s;ee the great work of redemption wrought for the &s;alvation of their immortal &s;ouls, before the day of their vi&s;itation goes over.</P>
<P>Powerful God of Life! thy little remnant which thou ha&s;t redeemed, keep them by thy power, and pre&s;erve them in uprightne&s;s and cleanne&s;s of mind; pre&s;erve them in the places and &s;tations wherein thou ha&s;t appointed them to dwell, that &s;o in all the trials, and tribulations, and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, that may come upon them, they may be quiet and &s;till, and in patience po&s;&s;e&s;s their &s;ouls; and let them have &s;trong con&s;olation in that everla&s;ting covenant which in thy Son thou ha&s;t made with them, and revealed to them; and let them not he moved and to&s;&s;ed with the hurries of this world, with the tumults and di&s;orders that evil men make in it, and the &s;torms and the tempe&s;ts that are rai&s;ed; but let their hearts and minds be &s;tayed upon thee, that they may know how to behave them&s;elves towards thee and one another, and towards all that are without, and thereby glorify and magnify thy great name by the beauty of holine&s;s &s;hining in their conver&s;ations, which may reach the con&s;ciences of
<PB N="385" REF="020309_0385_0FAEF8AF92B3A0D0">
men, that all that &s;ee them may &s;ay, the&s;e are the plants that the right hand of God hath planted, and &s;ee the fruits that are brought forth from that root of life revealed in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>Powerful God of Life! carry on thine own work in this city and the whole nation, and in other places among the people which thou ha&s;t cho&s;en and gathered to thy&s;elf out of the world.</P>
<P>Powerful God of Life! remember tho&s;e that groan in &s;ecret, making their moan to thee, that they cannot lay hold of thy &s;alvation for their &s;ouls: Prepare them for that con|&s;olation that their &s;ouls are breathing after: They are night and day wre&s;tling with thee by earne&s;t prayer, but what will all their wre&s;tling &s;ignify, except thy word and the power of thy grace a&s;&s;i&s;t them, and teach them to lay hold of thy &s;trength, that they may fight the good fight of faith, that they may get the victory, and rejoice in thy &s;alvation, and &s;ee the glory of it? Thou &s;ee&s;t how the children of men are working and contriving divers ways for their own &s;alvation; make them to know that all their own ways and inventions are in vain.</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed God of Life! confound the devices of the ungodly that &s;eek to lay wa&s;te thy heritage; and all tho&s;e that thou ha&s;t gathered by thy word, do thou pre&s;erve them, that they may &s;erve thee with &s;incere and upright minds all the days of their lives; and offer up daily thank&s;givings and living prai&s;es to thee, the true and living God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent, through thy eternal Spirit, who alone art worthy, God over all, ble&s;&s;ed forever and ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
