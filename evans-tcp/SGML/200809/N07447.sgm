For to me to live is Chri&s;t, and to die is gain.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE are the Words of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul.</HI> In the 20th ver. he declares, that it was his earne&s;t Expectation and Hope, that Chri&s;t &s;hould be magnified in his Body, whether by Life, or by Death. In this Ver. he gives a Rea&s;on of his Hope: <HI>For to me to live is Chri&s;t, and to die is gain.</HI> i. e. &s;ays an Expo&s;itor, "If I live, Chri&s;t &s;hall be the Scope of my Life, and End of my Living; I re&s;olve to live to his Service: if I die, Death will be a real gain to me." Others read the Words, "Chri&s;t is to me in Life and Death, Advantage or Gain."</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="2" REF="009513_0004_0F758B78681B41F8">I. It is the Character of every true Chri&s;tian, and faithful Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter; that for them to live is Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">II. It is their great Priviledge and Happine&s;s, that for them to die &s;hall be gain.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It is the Character of every true Chri&s;tian, and faithful Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter; that for them to live is Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. This is the Character of every <HI>true Chri&s;tian.</HI> All &s;uch as are given up to Chri&s;t in Bapti&s;m, and profe&s;s to be his Di&s;ciples; are under &s;olemn Obli|gations to &s;eek the Spirit of Chri&s;t, that they may live to him; and it is the Character of tho&s;e who are Chri&s;tians indeed, that they make the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, the <HI>Rule,</HI> and the Glory of God in Chri&s;t, the great <HI>End</HI> of their living. It is their great Concern and Endeavour, to depart from all Iniquity, and to walk worthy of the Lord to all plea&s;ing, by walking as becometh the Go&s;pel, even as the Grace of God, that bringeth Salvation teacheth us, <HI>that denying Ungodline&s;s and worldly Lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly in this pre&s;ent World:</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii.12.</NOTE> They not only call Chri&s;t, Lord; but do the Things which he &s;ays. They devote their Time and Talents, yea, their Lives to his Service.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is the Character of every <HI>faithful Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter, that for him to live is Chri&s;t.</HI> The A|po&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> calls him&s;elf a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel:<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. iii.6, 7.</NOTE> and it was his Care to live as became &s;uch an one.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate and confirm this Head, I would ob|&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="3" REF="009513_0005_0F758B7900921E40">1. It is the great Concern of &s;uch <HI>to obtain the Evidence of their Union with Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and of his dwelling in their Hearts by Faith.</HI> They are &s;en&s;ible, that unle&s;s they are united to him by his Spirit, and a living Faith; they can have no &s;piritual Communion with him in his &s;aving Benefits. <HI>He that is joined to the Lord, is one Spirit <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. vi.17.</NOTE>.</HI> And unle&s;s they are thus in Chri&s;t, they can't derive Grace from him to fulfil their Mini&s;try; nor in a right Manner depend upon him to fulfil his Word; <HI>I am with you alway.</HI> If de&s;titute of that Faith, which works <HI>by Love,</HI> tho' they had the mo&s;t &s;hining Gifts, and could &s;peak with the <HI>Tongues of Angels,</HI> yet they are but as &s;ounding Bra&s;s; an empty Noi&s;e: and what|ever Good others might receive by their Mini&s;try, they them&s;elves mu&s;t be ca&s;t away. Accordingly, they are earne&s;tly concerned that they may be able to &s;ay with the Apo&s;tle, <HI>I knew a Man in Chri&s;t:</HI> and that they may be found in him, cloathed with the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, by Faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P N="2">2. This implies <HI>their &s;incere Concern and Endea|vour to be acquainted with the Go&s;pel in &s;uch a Mea&s;ure, that they may be qualified to lead Souls to Chri&s;t, and build them up on their holy Faith.</HI> They are &s;en&s;ible, that this is the great De&s;ign and U&s;e of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, to lead Men to Chri&s;t, as the only Saviour of peri&s;hing Sinners. The &s;ame Apo&s;tle teacheth, that it is for the <HI>edifying of the Body of Chri&s;t;</HI> 'till we all come in the Unity of the Faith, and of the Knowledge of the Son of God.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv.12, 13.</NOTE> &mdash; And therefore the faithful Mini&s;ter, determineth not to know any Thing among his People, <HI>&s;ave Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and him crucified.</HI> Now, under this, is comprehend|ed, the Knowledge of the Truths, Doctrines and Pre|cepts of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; concerning the My|&s;tery
<PB N="4" REF="009513_0006_0F758B79C480FC10">
of God, and of the Father, and of Chri&s;t; his divine and human Natures united in one Per&s;on; his Offices, Laws, and &s;aving Benefits. Accordingly, the faithful Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, gives him&s;elf to Reading, Meditation and Prayer, that his Lips may pre&s;erve and communicate this Knowledge to his Hearers; that his Light may &s;hine before others, to give them the Knowledge of the Glory of God, in the Face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And this leads me to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="3">3. That the great Care and Endeavour of the faithful Mini&s;ter, is to <HI>preach Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> and <HI>teach the Things which concern his Kingdom and Glory.</HI> Thus <HI>Paul</HI> preached the Kingdom of God; and taught tho&s;e Things which concern the Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act. xxvili.31.</NOTE> And in another Place, he tells us, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iv.5.</NOTE> <HI>We preach not our &s;elves, but Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Lord.</HI> They dare not impo&s;e their own Notions, nor teach for Doctrines the Commandments of Men; but la|bour to keep clo&s;e to the pure Doctrines of the Go&s;|pel, teaching Men to ob&s;erve <HI>all Things what&s;oever Chri&s;t has commanded.</HI> The End and Scope of their Mini&s;try, is not to gain the Applau&s;e of Men, by pro&s;elyting them to any darling Opinions of their own, but to teach them the Knowledge of God and Chri&s;t, and the Way of Salvation as revealed in the infallible Oracles of the old and new Te&s;tament; that their Faith may &s;tand not in the Wi&s;dom of Men, but in the Power of God. <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ii.5.</NOTE></P>
<P N="4">4. The faithful Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, <HI>live by the Faith of the Son of God.</HI> And in this Re&s;pect, for to live to them is Chri&s;t. The Lord Je&s;us is the Be|liever's Life, and every faithful Pa&s;tor is &s;en&s;ible of this. Agreeably, the Apo&s;tle &s;ays to <HI>Timothy,</HI> 2 Epi&s;t.
<PB N="5" REF="009513_0007_0F758B7A50D55768">
ii 1. <HI>Thou therefore, my Son, be &s;trong in the Grace that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> And declares concerning him&s;elf: <HI>The Life which I now live in the Fle&s;h, I live by the Faith of the Son of God.</HI> Gal. ii. 20 He acknowledgeth that his Furniture and Ability for his &s;acred Work, were from the Lord, and that he liv'd upon Him, who <HI>counted him faithful, putting him into the Mini&s;try.</HI> Such realize it, that all their Sufficiency is of God, and is communicated to them through the Mediation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the glorious Head of the Church; and accordingly, they run the Race &s;et before them, looking unto Je&s;us, as the Au|thor and Fini&s;her of their Faith: who &s;aid to this Apo&s;tle, in a time of Extremity, <HI>My Grace is &s;uffici|ent for thee; for my Strength is made perfect in Weakne&s;s.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor, xii.9.</NOTE></P>
<P N="5">5. It implies, that it is their great <HI>Care and Endea|vour to follow the Example of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> When the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>for me to live is Chri&s;t,</HI> it intends, that he look'd unto Je&s;us, as his Pattern and Exem|plar, and labour'd that the &s;ame Mind might be in him, which was in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, 1 Cor. xi. 1. <HI>Be ye Followers of me, even as I am of Chri&s;t.</HI> The true evangelical Pa&s;tor is concerned, that the like Zeal for the Glory of God, the Purity of his Wor&s;hip, and the Salvation of the Soul's of Men; the like Humility, Patience and Submi&s;&s;ion to the Will of God; may be in him, which were &s;o con&s;picuous in the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us. It is his Care, that he may &s;hew forth the Virtues of this lovely Per&s;on, who was holy, harm|le&s;s, undefiled, and &s;eparate from Sinners: He not only preacheth, but lives the Go&s;pel in &s;ome good Mea&s;ure; bearing in Mind what our Lord &s;aid, when he had wa&s;hed his Di&s;ciples Feet, Joh. xiii. 14, 15. <HI>If I then your Lord and Ma&s;ter, have wa&s;hed your
<PB N="6" REF="009513_0008_0F758B7B182A4780">
Feet, ye al&s;o ought to wa&s;h one another's Feet, For I have given you an Example, that ye &s;hould do as I have done to you.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. The Scope and End of their Lives and Mini|&s;try are, that God in Chri&s;t <HI>may be glorified.</HI> They &s;eck not their own primarily, or chiefly, but the Things which are Je&s;us Chri&s;ts; that God in Chri&s;t may be glorified: many being brought to tru&s;t in him, to turn to God by him, and live as the obedient Subjects of the Lord. It is not their own Honor or Profit, which they are principally concerned for, but the ho|nor of Chri&s;t; that many may a&s;cribe Glory and Ho|nor and Ble&s;&s;ing to Him that &s;itteth on the Throne, and to the Lamb forever. Thus for them to live is Chri&s;t; when the great End of their Lives is to exalt the Re|deemer, and that his Go&s;pel may run and be glori|fied in the Salvation of many, form'd to &s;hew forth his Prai&s;e. 1 Pet iv. 11. <HI>if any Man &s;peak, let him &s;peak as the Oracles of God; if any Man mini&s;ter, let him do it as of the Ability which God giveth: that God in all Things may be glori|fied through Je&s;us Chri&s;t; to whom be Prai&s;e and Dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>The principal Joy of their Lives is to behold the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, &s;et up with Power, and flou|ri&s;hing in their own Souls, and in the Hearts of God's People.</HI> It is the Spirit and Temper of every faith|ful Mini&s;ter, to rejoyce in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and have no Confidence in the Fle&s;h. They love the Lord Je&s;us; and from love to Him, they feed his Sheep, and feed his Lambs. And from this cordial Affection, wi&s;h Pro&s;perity to the Son of <HI>David.</HI> The Ble&s;&s;ings of his Kingdom, which are Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Peace and Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t, are more to them, than the Joy of Harve&s;t. 1 The&s;&s;. iii, 8, 9. <HI>For now we live,
<PB N="7" REF="009513_0009_0F758B7C17B8A990">
if ye &s;tand fa&s;t in the Lord: For what Thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the Joy where|with we Joy for your Sakes before our God.</HI> It was the Comfort of their Lives, to behold the The&s;&s;alo|nians &s;tedfa&s;t in the Belief and Practice of the Reli|gion of Je&s;us; yea, they were their <HI>Crown and Joy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 the&s;. ii.20.</NOTE>.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>They count not their Lives dear, that they may fini&s;h their Conr&s;e with Joy, and the Mini&s;try which they have received of the Lord Je&s;us.</HI> It was the Spirit of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Act. xx.24</NOTE> and every faithful Pa&s;tor labours after the &s;ame Mind. He would not mi&s;s of the great End of living to the Lord Je&s;us; no, not for the &s;ake of prolonging this frail Life, and the Com|forts of it. They &s;pend, and are &s;pent for the Service of their great Ma&s;ter; and their great Care is to fini&s;h well, and receive the Reward of good and faith|ful Servants, Rom. xiv. 7, 8. <HI>For none of us liveth to him&s;elf, and no Man dieth to him&s;elf: For whe|ther we live, we live to the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord; whether we live there|fore, or die, we are the Lard's.</HI></P>
<P>And this brings me [to the &s;econd Head: Which is to con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>The great Priviledge and Happine&s;s of &s;uch, for whom to live is Chri&s;t: for them to die &s;hall be gain.</HI></P>
<P>Chri&s;tians, and Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters, <HI>mu&s;t die,</HI> as well as others. <HI>It is appointed unto Men once to die.</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. ix.27.</NOTE> We have all &s;inned; and the Wages of Sin, is Death.

Indeed, by Faith in Chri&s;t, every true Believer is deliver|ed from Sin, the Sting of Death; but not from the Stroke of Death. <HI>The&s;e all died in Faith <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. xi.13.</NOTE></HI> God will have this Mark of his holy Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t Sin abide in all A|ges, even upon his own Children. They mu&s;t in this Re|&s;pect be conformed to the Son of God, who fir&s;t &s;uf|fered Death, &amp; through this dark Valley, pa&s;&s;ed into Glo|ry. Yea, the Mini&s;ters of the Everla&s;ting Go&s;pel, who have &s;poken to us the Word of Life, mu&s;t die as well as others. <HI>Paul</HI> mu&s;t be offered: <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 pet. i.14.</NOTE> <HI>Peter</HI> mu&s;t <HI>put off this Tabernacle.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 pet. i.14.</NOTE> Our Fathers, where are they; and the Prophets, do they live for ever?

<P N="1">1.

<P>He was an able Mini&s;ter of the New Te&s;tament, endow'd with rich Gifts from our a&s;cended Saviour.

<P>ON Thur&s;day the 25th of this In&s;tant died, in the thirty-&s;eventh Year of his Age, the Reverend Mr. ALEXANDER CUMMING, one of the Pa&s;tors of the South Church in this Town; to the Grief of all who were acquainted with his ju&s;t Character.</P>
<P>THE Father of Spirits was pleas'd to form him with &s;uperior intellectual Abilities: His Apprehen&s;ion was quick and piercing; his Imagination lively and fruitful; his judgment accurate and &s;olid.</P>
<P>THESE Gifts of Nature were greatly improved by clo&s;e Thought and diligent Study; and, being &s;anctified by divine Grace, were employed to promote the Intere&s;ts of Religion.</P>
<P>HE early devoted him&s;elf to the Service of the Sanctu|ary, and in his public Performances you might di&s;cern the Marks of a &s;trong Mind.&mdash;It was ea&s;y to him to write on Points that to others were intricate and ab&s;tru&s;e; this might lead him to frequent Di&s;cour&s;es on &s;uch Sub|jects: but even in the&s;e, there were the evident Traces of a &s;erious Spirit, deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the great and important Truths of Religion.</P>
<P>His practical Di&s;cour&s;es were clear, animated and ju|dicious; they evidenced that he was him&s;elf well ac|quainted with the Chri&s;tian Temper, and being delivered with a grave and &s;triking Elocution, they were adapted to reach and better the Hearts of his Hearers.</P>
<P><PB REF="009513_0024_0F758B87CECF8CB8">HIS Conver&s;ation was amiable and u&s;eful, He was &s;erious without Affectation, and affable without Levity or Meanne&s;s. You &s;aw at once the polite Gentleman, the fair Rea&s;oner, the accompli&s;h'd Divine, and the exem|plary Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>THOUGH he wanted not Sen&s;ibility, he had a great command of his Pa&s;&s;ions, not ea&s;ily ruffled in his Tem|per, or betrayed to ra&s;hne&s;s in his Expre&s;&s;ions; knowing how to be firm and re&s;olved, without lo&s;ing the compo|&s;ure of his Mind, or the gentlene&s;s of his Manners.</P>
<P>HONESTY and uprightne&s;s were di&s;tingui&s;hing Parts of his Character; He was a Stranger to Di&s;&s;imulation him|&s;elf, and abhor'd it in others.</P>
<P>HIS Religion was pure and &s;ub&s;tantial; free from the Follies of Super&s;tition, or the Reveries of Enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>HIS Con&s;titution, naturally tender, was &s;everely tried with frequent Paroxi&s;ms of Pain, which were of a threat|ning A&s;pect; he bore the&s;e with Chri&s;tian Patience: When in moderate Health, he was a plea&s;ant Companion, and went through the Duties of his Station with Diligence and Chearfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>HIS la&s;t Illne&s;s came upon him with &s;uch Violence, as exhau&s;ted his Spirits, and rendered him incapable of &s;ay|ing much to his Friends. He continued however in full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him&s;elf, till ju&s;t before he expired, and &s;pake of his Departure with calmne&s;s and Serenity. He was willing to die, tho' he had almo&s;t every earthly Induce|ment to make him de&s;irous of living&mdash;He knew in whom he had believed, and expre&s;&s;ed his firm Reliance on the Merits of the compa&s;&s;ionate Redeemer of Men. He met the Approaches of Death, like one who believed and hoped for Immortality.</P>
<P>HIS Removal is a Lo&s;s to the Public&mdash;It peculiarly affects the Church and Congregation to whom he mini|&s;ter'd: They with Plea&s;ure beheld him &s;erving as a Son with the venerable Dr. SEWALL, who having obtain'd help from GOD &s;till &s;urvives, to lead and comfort them under this melancholy Bereavement.</P>
<P>MR. CUMMING'S Remains were interred Ye&s;terday, with every Mark of Re&s;pect.</P>
