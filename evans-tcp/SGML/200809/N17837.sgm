<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE author takes this method to inform the Sub&s;cribers, and others who heard the following Sermons, that as they were delivered only from &s;ome loo&s;e and general hints, without the mo&s;t di&s;tant thought of their being ever made more publick, he was rather di&s;agreeably affected at receiving a reque&s;t for printing them. But &s;ince the re|que&s;t has been pre&s;ented, he has endeavoured to recollect the ideas then &s;ugge&s;ted, and flatters him&s;elf that no material one is omitted. The &s;ermons will evidently retain their original features, though it is con|fe&s;&s;ed, that by &s;everal additions they have grown to a greater &s;ize. To publi&s;h &s;entiments on &s;ubjects &s;o differently thought of, and di&s;puta|ble as the following, cannot be eligible. But as every per&s;on has a right to his own opinion, the author, little anxious what others may think or &s;ay of him, calmly &s;ubmits them to public cen&s;ure. If they may, by the ble&s;&s;ing of <HI>GOD,</HI> be the means of diffu&s;ing a &s;pirit of can|dor, among different men who keep their minds open to conviction; and e&s;pecially if they &s;o impre&s;s the mind of the reader, with a &s;en&s;e of his lo&s;s in <HI>Adam,</HI> as to convince him of the nece&s;&s;ity of an intere&s;t in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> through whom ju&s;tification and life are only to be obtained; and put him on proper mea&s;ures to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of covenant qualifi|cations, for future happine&s;s, he will con&s;ider him&s;elf amply compen|&s;ated for all his pains; and though others may &s;coff and condemn, will abundantly rejoice.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AMONG the preachers of the go&s;pel a great diver&s;ity of practice prevails, not only as to the <HI>manner,</HI> but as to the <HI>matter</HI> of their <HI>publick</HI> exhibitions. Some almo&s;t con&s;tantly dwell on the moral precepts of the go&s;pel; whil&s;t others &s;tudiou&s;ly avoiding the&s;e topicks, entertain their hearers chiefly with the doctrinal parts of revelation. The&s;e are extremes which all will carefully avoid who take St. Paul for their pattern, and mean to be governed by his advice. <HI>He kept back nothing that was profita|ble to his hearers. He te&s;tified both to the Jews and Greeks repent|ance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and &s;hunned not to declare the whole coun&s;el of God.</HI> Now as <HI>all &s;cripture is given by in&s;piration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, reproof, correction and in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furni&s;hed unto every good work,</HI> every faithful mi|ni&s;ter will, by a &s;uitable attention to all parts of revealed truth, endeavour <HI>to feed the church of God, which he hath purcha&s;ed by his own blood.</HI> And though he will by no means neglect to explain
<PB N="6" REF="023103_0005_0FBC3ABA84763640">
and enforce the moral precepts of the go&s;pel, pointing out to chri&s;tians the way of their duty; yet as the doctrines thereof, when properly interpreted, give us exalted ideas of the wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice, and goodne&s;s of God, and furni&s;h the &s;tronge&s;t arguments to an holy temper, in which the e&s;&s;ence of religion con&s;i&s;ts, he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> believe it to be his duty, at certain times, to di&s;cour&s;e on the peculiar doctrines of revelation; that having laid this foundation, he may build thereon that &s;uper&s;tructure of moral and evangeli|cal duties, which, when enforced by motives derived from the&s;e doctrines, will, by the influence of the &s;pirit, &s;trongly impel his hearers to tho&s;e pious and devout exerci&s;es of the heart, which qualify them for, and by the con&s;titution of the covenant of grace, introduce them to the happine&s;s of the heavenly world. Deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the&s;e thoughts, I &s;hall this day <HI>earne&s;tly,</HI> though mode&s;tly, <HI>contend for the faith once delivered unto the &s;aints;</HI> and without pretending to any &s;uperior &s;agacity or information, &s;hall, according to my ideas of duty, proceed to give my &s;entiments, concerning the <HI>lap&s;e</HI> and <HI>recovery</HI> of mankind; doctrines differ|ently explained by different men; from which angry di&s;putes have ari&s;en in the chri&s;tian church, to the detriment of that <HI>cha|rity which is the bond of perfectne&s;s, the end of the commandment, and the fulfilling of the law.</HI></P>
<P>IN the cour&s;e of my reading, and from a long acquaintance with many of my fellow men, I have had the be&s;t rea&s;on to con|clude, that whil&s;t &s;ome have con&s;idered the fall as having no per|nicious influence on the human race, &s;ubjecting them <HI>only</HI> to temporal death; others have carried their &s;entiments to a con|trary extreme, and view <HI>Adam's</HI> &s;in, in all &s;en&s;es, the &s;in of all his numerous de&s;cendants. They even go &s;o far as to &s;uppo&s;e that great numbers of infants are now &s;uffering the extreme&s;t mi&s;ery in hell, merely on account of their being the unhappy children of a &s;inful father, or from their participation of his guilt. They further believe that all mankind have <HI>totally</HI> lo&s;t the image of God; the power of election, or liberty of choice; all moral good|ne&s;s, as well as all principles of holine&s;s; and con&s;equently that they are <HI>totally corrupt,</HI> and <HI>wholly inclined</HI> to evil, and that <HI>continually.</HI> Now the&s;e great extremes appear to me to be wide from the real truth, and faulty in a certain degree. The truth, in this as in mo&s;t other ca&s;es, lies in a happy medium between them, as I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew in the &s;equel of this di&s;cour&s;e. In farther treating on which, I &s;hall arrange my thoughts under the two following heads:
<LIST>
<PB N="7" REF="023103_0006_0FBC3ABEF254FE98">
<ITEM>I. SHALL &s;ay &s;omething of the <HI>one man's di&s;obedience by which many were made &s;inners.</HI> And</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. SHALL enquire how the many, or all, were made &s;in|ners by his di&s;obedience.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>UNDER the fir&s;t head we may ob&s;erve, that by the <HI>one man,</HI> we are to under&s;tand Adam, the fir&s;t of the human race, created in an extraordinary manner out of the du&s;t of the earth, but yet made in the image of God. Now this image con&s;i&s;ted, not in the form of his body, but in the powers and qualities of his mind; as hav|ing dominion over all terre&s;trial creatures. As God is the &s;u|preme Governor, man bears &s;ome likene&s;s to him, as dominion was given to him, <HI>over the fi&s;h of the &s;ea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the face of the earth.</HI> This part of the divine image, however impaired, is not totally lo&s;t. But the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part of the image of God in which man was made, con&s;i&s;ted in that perfection of his nature, which was endued with <HI>rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>will,</HI> with <HI>under&s;tanding</HI> and <HI>true holi|ne&s;s.</HI> And in this re&s;pect he was <HI>made but a little lower than the angels, and crowned with glory and honor.</HI> Concerning God, we read, that <HI>his under&s;tanding is infinite; he talleth the number of the &s;tars, and calleth them all by name.</HI> And has not man an under|&s;tanding, which, though infinitely inferior to his Maker's, ca|pacitates him, when properly cultivated, to unfold a thou&s;and difficulties, to rove from &s;tar to &s;tar, to a&s;certain the laws of the heavenly bodies, to calculate eclip&s;es, and to predict, with cer|tainty, many future and very di&s;tant events? Though this part of the divine image may be greatly effaced, yet none can with rea&s;on pretend that it is totally lo&s;t. Again; he &s;till retains &s;omething of the image of the Creator, as he is a moral agent, has a &s;en&s;e of right and wrong, and a will to chu&s;e the good and refu&s;e the evil, though not, we may well &s;uppo&s;e, in the degree that Adam enjoyed it before he fell; yet &s;o as to make him, a &s;ubject of law, re&s;pon&s;ible for his actions, and capable of rewards and puni&s;hments. La&s;tly, he was made in the image of God, not only as he had a power of acquiring a holy temper, but had a principle of holine&s;s implanted in his fir&s;t formation. If we do not believe this, it is difficult to conceive how God could pro|nounce this part of his work <HI>very good;</HI> or how <HI>Solomon</HI> could &s;ay, <HI>God made man upright, but they have &s;ought out many inventions.</HI> Or what con&s;i&s;tent meaning we can put on the Apo&s;tle's exhor|tation to the Ephe&s;ians, <HI>be renewed in the &s;pirit of your minds, and put on the new man, who after God is created in righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s?</HI> What more rational interpretation can we put on the&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="023103_0007_0FBC3AC1800A0A50">
words, than that man was fir&s;t created with the principles of holi|ne&s;s in his heart; that he lo&s;t them by his offence in eating the forbidden fruit; and his po&s;terity al&s;o; and that <HI>they</HI> mu&s;t be re|newed to this temper, or recovered to this character, or never be fit for the kingdom of heaven? The conclu&s;ion therefore is, that this part of the divine image was lo&s;t in the fall: and that though there &s;till remain many amiable qualities in the hearts of men, yet that they are de&s;titute of all holine&s;s till renewed by the &s;pirit of God. But what was that &s;in of our fir&s;t father by which he in part lo&s;t the image of God, and entailed the &s;ame di&s;advant|age on his numerous progeny? It was his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of a po&s;i|tive command not to eat of <HI>the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</HI> This prohibition was equivalent to a command to keep his &s;en&s;es and his appetites under the control of rea&s;on. It was an ea&s;y ta&s;k which the Lord of all &s;aw fit to impo&s;e on his new formed creature, man. Though as a rational creature he was obliged to obey all the laws of his nature; yet on this &s;imple condition his happine&s;s was &s;u&s;pended; and this was made the term of his enjoying the continued favor of his Creator. And had he been obedient in this &s;ingle in&s;tance, he and his po&s;terity would have been continued in endle&s;s life. But wonderful to relate, this man, newly created, and formed in the divine image, with fre|quent communications from his Maker, and the fate of his po&s;|terity depending, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the law and involved his offspring, together with him&s;elf, in a &s;cene of wretchedne&s;s unutterable, had it not been for the advent of a Saviour! This &s;in was perpetrated through the influence of that malicious fiend, <HI>who walks about &s;eeking whom he may devour.</HI> The Devil, in the form of a &s;erpent, to which he communicated &s;peech, attacked the woman, <HI>the weaker ve&s;&s;el,</HI> propounded a doubtful que&s;tion, then denied the truth of God's threatening, gave her a contrary promi&s;e, and u&s;ed the name of God to confirm it. Thus &s;ubtilly did he manage in &s;educing our fir&s;t parents from their duty! But though the grand adver&s;ary was concerned in this temptation, yet the man and woman were highly culpable in entering into <HI>parlance</HI> with him, doubting the veracity of their Creator, and eating the withholden fruit: For it mu&s;t here be remembered, that even the temptation of Satan is no excu&s;e for &s;in. He can do no more than tempt, and if <HI>we re&s;i&s;t him he will flee from us.</HI> This &s;in of the fir&s;t founders of our race, was attended with aggravating circum&s;tan|ces, and was a virtual violation of all the commands of the deca|logue. The fir&s;t was broken by withdrawing faith from God, and placing it in Satan: The &s;econd, by giving a &s;ort of wor&s;hip
<PB N="9" REF="023103_0008_0FBC3AC294957C48">
to this malignant &s;pirit, in preferring his declarations before tho&s;e of their liege or rightful Lord: The third by profaning the name of God in treating it with &s;o much contempt as to credit the devil rather than Jehovah, when there was a contrariety in their declarations. And the fourth al&s;o, if what &s;ome &s;urmi&s;e be true, that this &s;in was committed on the Sabbath. The fifth com|mand requires obedience to &s;uperiors. Eve therefore, in not con|&s;ulting her hu&s;band, and Adam in hearkening to his wife more than to God, really violated it. And what did they le&s;s than murder their children; when they could not but know if the threatening was fulfilled, it would prevent their exi&s;tence, or re|duce them to de&s;truction; directly in oppo&s;ition to the &s;ixth com|mand which requires us <HI>not to kill.</HI> The &s;eventh command pro|hibits the indulgence of the &s;en&s;ual appetite. But did not Adam more attend to the propen&s;ities of animal nature, than to the command of God in eating this fair and tempting fruit? And was the eighth unbroken by him when he manife&s;ted &s;uch di&s;con|tent with his pre&s;ent condition; and in order to better it, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;urreptitiou&s;ly took the inhibited fruit, in the face of that authoritative injunction, <HI>thou &s;halt not &s;teal.</HI> The ninth re|quires not to <HI>bear fal&s;e witne&s;s;</HI> and this virtually implies that we &s;hould not receive a fal&s;e accu&s;ation again&s;t any. But did not Adam, in this in&s;tance, pa&s;s a fal&s;e judgment on the fruit, and admit the fal&s;e accu&s;ations of Satan again&s;t his &s;overeign Lord? Adam and his happy companion had full liberty to range amid&s;t a wilderne&s;s of &s;weets, and freely to regale them&s;elves with all that variety of delicious fruits, with which the garden of Eden abounded, excepting one &s;ingle tree. Did they not, therefore, di&s;cover the &s;trong prevalence of the covetous de&s;ire, when they invaded the interdicted fruit, and pre&s;umptuou&s;ly partook of that to which they had no title? By this brief enumeration of parti|culars, it appears that their &s;in was <HI>aggravated, exten&s;ive</HI> and <HI>com|plicated;</HI> amounting to a breach of all the ten commands; and if the&s;e commands, as <HI>mo&s;t</HI> &s;uppo&s;e, comprehended the whole circle of moral duties, <HI>then</HI> in this &s;ingle act, he violated the law of his nature, and was guilty of a crime of the deepe&s;t dye.</P>
<P>I COME in the &s;econd place to enquire how <HI>many,</HI> or all man|kind, <HI>were made &s;inners by his di&s;obedience.</HI> It &s;eems by the re|pre&s;entation of &s;cripture, our only guide in this matter, that Adam's &s;in was not in its influence confined to him&s;elf, but in &s;ome way or another de&s;cended to his children. He was their natural, if not their federal head, and his fortune therefore they mu&s;t follow. Now though Adam was not naturally immortal, yet if he had been obedient in the &s;ingle in&s;tance of the forbid|den
<PB N="10" REF="023103_0009_0FBC3AC41E6E63D8">
fruit, he was, by partaking of the tree of life, <HI>to have lived for ever</HI> and his po&s;terity likewi&s;e. But in ca&s;e of di&s;obedience, it was threatened that he &s;hould die. <HI>In the day thou eate&s;t thereof thou &s;halt &s;urely die.</HI> And accordingly the &s;entence was, <HI>du&s;t thou art, and to du&s;t thou &s;halt return.</HI> Now this &s;entence was not confined to him alone, but extended to all that proceeded from his loins. Here two que&s;tions naturally ari&s;e. Fir&s;t, what are we to under&s;tand by this death? And &s;econdly, how comes it to fall upon Adam's po&s;terity? To the fir&s;t que&s;tion, it may be an|&s;wered; if we con&s;ider the words of the threatening in connexion with the &s;entence afterwards pa&s;&s;ed, we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that noth|ing more than temporal death, with the evils that precede and u&s;her it into the world was intended. But yet &s;ome a&s;&s;ert, that <HI>temporal, &s;piritual</HI> and <HI>eternal</HI> death are all meant by that threat|ening. But this we know cannot be true, according to St. Paul's manner of expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf on the &s;ubject. Tho' <HI>natural,</HI> and even <HI>&s;piritual</HI> death may be intended thereby, yet <HI>eternal</HI> de&s;truction, as it is commonly under&s;tood, could not be meant, if we take him as our expo&s;itor. For he tells us in the chapter of my text, &s;peaking of the con&s;equence of Adam's &s;in, <HI>that death hath pa&s;&s;ed upon all men, for that all have &s;inned.</HI> Now it is not true that eternal death <HI>hath,</HI> or ever <HI>will pa&s;s</HI> upon all men; for the righte|ous will be received into heaven through the merit of Chri&s;t. I &s;ay, therefore, that nothing more than <HI>temporal</HI> and <HI>&s;piritual death</HI> can po&s;&s;ibly be meant by that term. As to temporal or natural death, that this will &s;ooner or later fall upon all the &s;ons of Adam by rea&s;on of his &s;in, none deny. But how or by what means does this take place upon the offspring of Adam? How are we all thus made &s;inners by him? I an&s;wer, by <HI>imputation.</HI> In this way natural death comes upon all the &s;ons of men. There are &s;ome, I am &s;en&s;ible, who chu&s;e not to hear any thing of impu|tation in this &s;en&s;e of the word; and even others are to be found, who, though they allow the imputation of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s, deny in the mo&s;t unaccountable manner, the imputation of Ad|am's &s;in. But as the word is capable of a rational interpretation in this &s;en&s;e, and as it has been u&s;ed by former divines, I there|fore retain it, and a&s;&s;ert that it is by the <HI>imputation</HI> of the legal effect of Adam's &s;in, that all his children become mortal, and will &s;ooner or later die a natural death. If any di&s;like the term, they cannot deny the doctrine, if they are believers in divine re|velation. St. Paul a&s;&s;erts it, and has u&s;ed arguments to prove it, in the chapter of my text. <HI>By one man &s;in entered into the world, and death by &s;in.</HI> And in Corinthians he tells us, <HI>As in Adam all die, &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive.</HI> And to prove
<PB N="11" REF="023103_0010_0FBC3AC591C145D8">
his a&s;&s;ertion in the twelfth ver&s;e, he thus argues in the two fol|lowing ones; <HI>for until the law, death was in the world, yet death is not imputed where there is no law. Neverthele&s;s, death reign|ed from Adam to Mo&s;es, even over them that had not &s;inned after the &s;imilitude of Adam's tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</HI> The meaning of which is this, though there were both &s;in and death in that long &s;pace which in|tervened between Adam and Mo&s;es, yet as there was no po&s;itive command threatening death as the penalty of di&s;obedience, dur|ing that term, therefore men did not die for their own &s;ins, but for the di&s;obedience of Adam; for where there is no law &s;ubject|ing men to death for di&s;obedience, <HI>there</HI> certainly <HI>can be no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. As Adam was not only &s;ubjected to natural death by his &s;in, but was al&s;o condemned by the law of his na|ture as a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, having lo&s;t that image of God which con|&s;i&s;ted in <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s,</HI> and which was the &s;upreme excellence of his nature; &s;o his po&s;terity, by imputation, come into the world devoid of holy principles, and, con&s;equently, as not coming up to the requirements of the law of their nature, are in a &s;tate of condemnation by it, even previou&s;ly to their commi&s;&s;ion of any actual tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. Though this, in the eye of the law, is an important defect, for which they are doomed, by the righteous con&s;titution of heaven, to many di&s;abilities; yet it does not come up to our ideas of the formal nature of &s;in; to con&s;titute which there mu&s;t be the con&s;ent of the will, in a per&s;on, who is a free agent, or has arrived to years of under|&s;tanding. It is a defect al&s;o which mu&s;t be remedied, or they can never obtain ju&s;tification at the bar of God; never become <HI>recti in l<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">e.</HI> Whether this is the idea that &s;ome men mean to expre&s;s by our being born into the world in a &s;tate of nature <HI>le&s;s perfect than Adam was when he fir&s;t came out of the hands at his Maker,</HI> or what others intend by the <HI>corruption and depravity of human na|ture,</HI> I neither know nor care. It is an idea I have been led to adopt from reading the &s;criptures; without which I cannot run a com|plete parallel between Adam and Chri&s;t, who are heads of their re&s;pective &s;eeds, and covenants, and counterparts to each other; nor give a full and con&s;i&s;tent interpretation of &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in the New Te&s;tament. This is called by &s;ome &s;piritual death, and not improperly, if we do not include in the notion of it, the an|gui&s;h of a guilty con&s;cience; and the infliction of new &s;orrows on the &s;oul. The angui&s;h of a guilty con&s;cience, and the in|fliction of po&s;itive pains on the &s;oul, are the effects not of im|puted, but of actual and per&s;onal &s;in. But &s;till Adam's de&s;cend|ants are <HI>&s;piritually</HI> dead, as they have no &s;eeds of holine&s;s in their hearts, no exerci&s;es or &s;en&s;ations of the divine life; and <HI>judicially</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="023103_0011_0FBC3AC7E7B665A8">
as they are condemned by the mouth of the Lawgiver, or by his law. And being thus condemned by the law as dead to all holy &s;en&s;ations, they mu&s;t, had it not been for the new con&s;titution of grace, introduced by Chri&s;t, either been held for ever, under the bondage of the grave, or &s;ome way made po&s;itively wretched. But &s;ince the provi&s;ion of a Saviour, there is now no room for &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition; &s;ince he certainly ju&s;tifies <HI>all</HI> from the con|demnation of death; and all who <HI>believe</HI> in him from all other condemnation, whether ari&s;ing from the legal effects of Adam's &s;in imputed, or from their own actual tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; and rein|&s;tates them in the &s;avor of God. Now, if tho&s;e who have never been guilty of per&s;onal di&s;obedience are to be rai&s;ed from the dead as well as others; the pre&s;umption is, from the known character of God, and his acknowledged benevolence, that they are rai&s;ed, not for the purpo&s;e of being made po&s;itively wretched in hell; but happy in the pre&s;ence of God in heaven; all legal di&s;abilities being fir&s;t removed, and an holy principle implanted, without which they &s;hall never &s;ee the Lord. Now this, in a manner explicable to us, is done in the new birth; and therefore this new birth is nece&s;&s;ary for all the &s;ons of Adam, of every age, character and condition. This &s;eems to be the repre&s;entation of &s;cripture, for it declares, <HI>except a man,</HI> it is tran&s;lated, but it ought to have been <HI>except any one</HI> (for that is the force of the Greek article <GAP DESC="foreign">) <HI>is born again, he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God.</HI> And what better rea&s;on can po&s;&s;ibly be a&s;&s;igned for the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of the new birth, for all men univer&s;ally, of every age, nation and character, whether they have been guilty of actual &s;ins or not, than the &s;entiment I have been advancing under this head, namely, that all men are condemned by the law of God as being de&s;titute of any &s;eeds or principles of holine&s;s, until re|newed by the &s;pirit of God, and recovered thereto by the &s;pirit|ual proce&s;s of regeneration. Upon the whole; the bible repre|&s;ents mankind by nature as univer&s;ally condemned by the law, particularly in our context; <HI>the judgment was by one to condemna|tion; and by the offence of one the judgment came upon all men to con|demnation.</HI> Now that this condemnation was to &s;omething more than natural death, may be fairly argued from this con&s;ideration; that the ju&s;tification by the obedience of Chri&s;t, intends more than a re&s;urrection from the grave. And as the condemnation on the one part, mu&s;t be as exten&s;ive as the ju&s;tification on the other (&s;aying only that Chri&s;t's obedience in <HI>merit</HI> &s;o far exceeds Adam's di&s;obedience in <HI>demerit,</HI> as to deliver from per&s;onal as well as imputed &s;ins) hence the argument is <HI>highly probable,</HI> if not <HI>ab&s;olutely conclu&s;ive,</HI> that merely by Adam's &s;in his po&s;terity is &s;ub|jected
<PB N="13" REF="023103_0012_0FBC3ACC1D2DB618">
to other di&s;abilities than natural death; becau&s;e, by Chri&s;t's obedience they are exempted from other penal effects, be&s;ides death. I therefore, on the truth of the foregoing ob&s;ervations, proceed to ob&s;erve further, that if tho&s;e who have never been guilty of actual &s;ins (to which the con&s;ent of the will is nece&s;&s;ary) are condemned by the law to &s;omething more than natural death, or in a &s;en&s;e different from it, then &s;urely tho&s;e who have made Adam's &s;in, in the fulle&s;t &s;en&s;e, their own, by the commi&s;&s;ion of many actual offences, are condemned in a fuller or higher &s;en&s;e: from the penal effects of which, however, the obedience of Chri&s;t is &s;ufficient to exempt them. Before I proceed to the next head of di&s;cour&s;e, it is nece&s;&s;ary, to prevent any mi&s;takes, that I &s;hould &s;ubjoin the following ob&s;ervation; that though Ad|am's &s;in was in its legal effects imputed to his po&s;terity in the &s;en&s;e above mentioned; yet we are not from thence to conclude, that it is, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word, the &s;in of his de&s;cend|ants. This is impo&s;&s;ible. Sin is a quality intransferable. We may be &s;ufferers even to death by it; yet not con&s;cious of his guilt; nor is it po&s;&s;ible to repent of it as we may and ought, of tho&s;e which we have per&s;onally committed, by the free con&s;ent of our own wills. Adam, when he offended, was <HI>afraid, a&s;ham|ed,</HI> and <HI>con&s;cious of evil de&s;ert;</HI> hence it is &s;aid he perceived him|&s;elf naked; and endeavoured to hide him&s;elf from the pre&s;ence of the Lord. But though we ought to be a&s;hamed and repent of our own &s;ins, yet for Adam's offence we cannot feel any &s;uch &s;en&s;ations. All therefore that is intended by the imputation of his &s;in to his po&s;terity is, that the effects of it are &s;et to our ac|count, that we are treated as &s;inners, and are &s;ubjected to a thou|&s;and inconveniences on the account thereof. I will now illu&s;trate my idea by the following example. In &s;ome European kingdoms, where the title of nobility obtains, if a nobleman is guilty of trea|&s;on, together with his life, he forfeits his e&s;tate and honors; and this forfeiture de&s;cends to his children; they lo&s;e their e&s;tate and honors by rea&s;on of his &s;in. And yet, who in his &s;en&s;es can be|lieve that the &s;in of trea&s;on perpetrated by the father is in any &s;en&s;e, except its legal effects, the &s;in of his children? In a &s;en&s;e &s;omewhat analogous, it may be ob&s;erved; that often times pa|rents, rendered infirm by a cour&s;e of intemperance and debauch|ery, propagate children under the&s;e unhappy circum&s;tances, who all their lives undergo great langours, and often times die pre|maturely on that very account; and yet mo&s;t certainly we cannot think that the debauchery of the parents was, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, the &s;in of the children. Again; if we chu&s;e a repre&s;ent|ative to legi&s;late for us, and he from &s;ini&s;ter, or other evil mo|tives,
<PB N="14" REF="023103_0013_0FBC3ACDDA883C80">
is induced to concur with others in the enaction of inju|rious and oppre&s;&s;ive laws (as the ca&s;e is &s;uppo&s;able, and I believe has &s;ometimes been the truth of fact) the &s;in con&s;idered as &s;uch is peculiar to him&s;elf, but the evil effects fall upon his con&s;tituents, however innocent, till the laws are repealed, or cea&s;e to operate. Thus Adam who was our natural, if not our federal head, has by his di&s;obedience entailed many mi&s;eries upon us; and thus we are by imputation &s;inners, or rather &s;ufferers through him. But then I go on and &s;ay farther, that <HI>through one man's di&s;obedience, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> all</HI> were made &s;inners <HI>actually</HI> or <HI>inherently.</HI> In order to conceive how this takes place we mu&s;t con&s;ider, that men are now born into the world, without a principle of holine&s;s in their hearts; with a le&s;s perfect nature than Adam, or in a &s;tate of corruption and depravity; and being moreover &s;ubjected to death with the various evils and calamities connected with, and attend|ant on it, do, under the&s;e &s;everal di&s;advantages, unavoidably commit iniquity, when they arrive at the exerci&s;e of their rational or mental powers. To this &s;ad event, viz. <HI>actual &s;in,</HI> each of the cau&s;es abovementioned contributes its re&s;pective proportion; but natural death has perhaps the main influence in the produc|tion of it. To perceive this, we need only advert to the Apo&s;tle's records in the 12th ver&s;e of the chapter from whence our text was taken quoted before, and make a &s;mall alteration in the tran&s;|lation; as there is great rea&s;on to believe the pre&s;ent one is faulty. The ver&s;e is this; <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> man &s;in entered into the world, and death by &s;in; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> death hath pa&s;&s;ed upon all men, for that all have &s;inned.</HI> From this ver&s;e we collect with the utmo&s;t certainty, that Adam's &s;in introduced &s;in and death, into our world, together with all the temporal evils attendant on humanity, pain, &s;ickne&s;s, &s;orrow and vanity. If it had been rightly tran&s;lated it would have told us very plainly in <HI>what way,</HI> or by what influence it occa&s;ioned the reign of actual &s;in among the children of men. To po&s;&s;e&s;s our&s;elves of this idea we need only correct a &s;mall error in the tran&s;lation of the latter clau&s;e of the ver&s;e, and in&s;tead of the words <HI>for that,</HI> &s;ub&s;titute the words <HI>upon which,</HI> or <HI>in con&s;equence of which, all have &s;inned.</HI> The words <GAP DESC="foreign">, tran&s;lated for that, are not only capable of this interpretation, but this is their inva|riable meaning throughout the New Te&s;tament, as I could ea&s;ily make evident; and al&s;o in other Greek authors, as has been make evident in a degree, by a learned writer, who lived in this century, and died with the de&s;erved character of a ju&s;t and great critick. The proper meaning of the pa&s;&s;age according to this in|terpretation (which I &s;uppo&s;e is perfectly ju&s;t) is this, that death was the imputed effect of the fir&s;t man's &s;in; and that this death,
<PB N="15" REF="023103_0014_0FBC3ACF5B700470">
with all its preceding and attendant inconveniences, has occa&s;ion|ed the univer&s;al reign of actual &s;in, among all tho&s;e who come to a capacity of actual tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. Death has introduced great di&s;orders among the human &s;pecies. It has de&s;troyed that nice balance between their rea&s;on, appetites and pa&s;&s;ions, which God fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed. It has by rea&s;on of the cur&s;e on the ground, which makes a livelihood difficult and hard to be obtained, even by enervating toll, called in &s;cripture the <HI>&s;weat of the brow,</HI> occa|&s;ioned tho&s;e numerous frauds, chickanery and circumvention, which not only di&s;grace human nature, but make the world a &s;cene of woe. Had it not been for death, and the lo&s;s of that image of God which con&s;i&s;ted in <HI>true holine&s;s,</HI> the mind would have been clear, the affections calm; the appetites &s;ubordinate to rea&s;on, the man happy; all his various powers and affections being harmoniou&s;ly &s;ub&s;ervient to the end of his creation, and powerfully, though &s;weetly impelling him, to a uniform obedience to law divine. But now being &s;ubjected by the righteous con&s;ti|tution of heaven, to death and its attendant troubles, temptations are multiplied upon us from every &s;ide, that we cannot &s;o fully re&s;i&s;t them, as to pre&s;erve the rectitude of our conduct; but do <HI>all,</HI> in a greater or le&s;&s;er degree, actually offend. Poverty and riches, dominion and &s;ervitude, honour and infamy, the effects of the apo&s;tacy, have their peculiar temptations to &s;in, which few or none re&s;i&s;t. Our fears of death &s;ubjecting us to bondage, oc|ca&s;ion di&s;content, anxious &s;olicitude, and perplexing concern, which con&s;titute the formal nature of &s;in. And from the le&s;s per|fect &s;tate of our nature, the con&s;equence of the fall, and the &s;ickne&s;s and death dependent on it, ari&s;e tho&s;e numerous <HI>lu&s;ts which war again&s;t the &s;oul, and bring us into captivity to the law of &s;in.</HI> From a clear perception of this the Apo&s;tle cried out. <HI>O wretched man that I am, who &s;hall deliver me from the body of this death!</HI> Some have &s;uppo&s;ed that this alludes to a practice prevailing a|mong &s;ome nations of tying a criminal to a dead <HI>&s;tinking <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> by way of puni&s;hment. But if this were the allu&s;ion, the true meaning of the phra&s;e is this, &s;ince my body &s;ubjected to death, entices me to &s;o many &s;ins, who will deliver me from it, or from this <HI>mortal body?</HI> which is a proper tran&s;lation of the phra&s;e. And then adds, for his own comfort, as well as the con&s;olation of others, <HI>I thank God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord,</HI> that this deliv|erance is to be obtained, through the in&s;titutions, grace, and recon|ciliation of the Saviour. But then, though the&s;e appetites, incli|nations, and de&s;ires have become &s;tronger, and rea&s;on weaker by means of the lap&s;e, yet they do not con&s;titute the formal nature of &s;in, till they gain the con&s;ent of the will. Though we may <HI>be
<PB N="16" REF="023103_0015_0FBC3AD0D569C408">
tempted by our own heart's lu&s;ts, and enticed,</HI> yet it is only <HI>when lu&s;t is conceived, that it bringeth forth &s;in,</HI> and <HI>&s;in when it is perfected,</HI> by giving the con&s;ent of the heart, <HI>bringeth forth death.</HI> Thus I have &s;hewn you how, by the di&s;obedience <HI>of one many are made &s;inners.</HI> If my explanations of the manner, in which mankind become &s;inners, in con&s;equence of Adam's &s;in, be different from what has heretofore been common; yet the conclu&s;ion of the whole matter is, on the &s;cheme above &s;ugge&s;ted, &s;imilar to that of ancient divines, who made Adam's &s;in, either mediately or immediately, the cau&s;e or occa&s;ion of all the &s;ins of men. This &s;hews that di&s;putes on this &s;ubject are for the mo&s;t part not e&s;&s;en|tial; being either verbal; or rather about the modes of its con|veyance; than again&s;t the truth, or exi&s;tence of the doctrine it&s;elf. I &s;hall therefore clo&s;e what I have &s;aid, under the doctrinal part of this &s;ubject, by this charitable ob&s;ervation, viz. that who|ever believes the fall of Adam to be the foundation of Chri&s;t's advent in our world, and that &s;cheme of grace which is mention|ed in the go&s;pel, believes all that is nece&s;&s;ary, to regulate his prac|tice, and form his temper, by leading him to a cheerful accept|ance of the redemption through the Saviour.</P>

<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>FIRST, from what has been &s;aid, we learn, that the &s;in of the fir&s;t man has introduced a tragical &s;cene upon the &s;tage of the pre&s;ent world. Death, pain, toil, vanity, and a thou&s;and dread|ful di&s;orders have entered by this door, and have made our earth, an ho&s;pital of di&s;ea&s;es, <HI>a place of &s;kulls, a field of blood.</HI> From this &s;ource carnage and de&s;truction are &s;pread around us; doleful &s;pectacles are pre&s;ented to our view, and the mo&s;t heart breaking &s;eparations frequently take place, among the deare&s;t friends, the mo&s;t intimate connexions. Hence the ro&s;y cheek, the ruby lips, and ivory teeth lo&s;e their attractive charms; and tho&s;e who once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them are turned to ugline&s;s and deformity. Hence <HI>we hear the voice of lementation and mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and refu&s;ing to be comforted, becau&s;e they are not.</HI> When we contemplate the mi&s;eries of mankind, originating from this fountain, we are often compelled to &s;hed the tear of compa&s;&s;ion; though for the &s;in that occa&s;ioned them, we cannot properly re|pent; for repentance implies <HI>con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt, &s;elf condemnation,</HI> and <HI>change of conduct,</HI> which, though nece&s;&s;ary for our own, can|not be for another's &s;ins.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="17" REF="023103_0016_0FBC3AD275CC4720">2dly. A &s;erious review of the foregoing &s;ubject, &s;hould make us all humble in our own &s;ight. <HI>Pride was never made for fallen man.</HI> Yet though our blood is under one common attainder, we find the&s;e ebullitions of pride which are truly &s;urpri&s;ing. One takes to him&s;elf important airs, on account of the noble or an|cient blood which runs in his veins. Another is proud of his beauty; third of the magnitude of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, the num|ber of his acres and the fullne&s;s of his coffers; a fourth of his rich attire; and a fifth, of his dignity and po&s;ts of honor; and on the&s;e accounts are induced to de&s;pi&s;e their fellow men, not thus di&s;tingui&s;hed. To &s;uppre&s;s the&s;e ri&s;ings of vanity, let us all <HI>look to the rock whence we were hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence we were digged,</HI> to Adam and Eve our fir&s;t progenitors; to the crime by which their dignity was le&s;&s;ened, and the imputa|tion of it to us, by which our glory is ob&s;cured. The little paul|try di&s;tinctions which take place among the children of men, are not worth regarding; <HI>di&s;tinctions,</HI> which will be &s;oon levelled in the grave to which we are de&s;tined, where the rich and the poor, the honorable and the ba&s;e, the beautiful and deformed, the learn|ed and ignorant, will lie neglected in one undi&s;tingui&s;hed and promi&s;cuous ma&s;s. After the revolution of a few years, we mu&s;t all go to that world <HI>from who&s;e bourne no traveller returns;</HI> where the&s;e di&s;tinctions will be of no avail; and where real <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> &s;hall alone be exalted. <HI>Let not therefore the wi&s;e man glory in his wi&s;dom; neither let the mighty man glory in his might; nor let the rich man glory in his riches; but let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he under&s;tandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord, who ex|erci&s;e loving kindne&s;s, and judgment, and righteou&s;ne&s;s in the earth.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3dly. UPON the explication given in the preceding di&s;cour&s;e, we learn, how to interpret and apply the following texts, and other &s;imilar ones, to be found in the &s;acred volume, which have been often quoted in this connexion, as an illu&s;tration of man's depravity, or fall. A few only &s;hall I mention, and they are the following. <HI>I was &s;hapen in iniquity, and in &s;in did my mother con|ceive me. That which is born of the fle&s;h is fle&s;h. Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? You hath he quickened who were dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins; and were by nature children of wrath even as others,</HI> &amp;c. Though I &s;hall not &s;top to give a particular ex|planation of each of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, I &s;hall ob&s;erve in general, that they do not prove that Adam's &s;in is, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, the &s;in of his de&s;cendants; but only that as men are born without any principles of holine&s;s, and are &s;ubjected to death, as a penal effect of the fall, they very early go a&s;tray after they have come to the u&s;e of their rea&s;on and moral powers; that all need to be
<PB N="18" REF="023103_0017_0FBC3AD3D660B2E0">
regenerated, and whil&s;t under the di&s;advantages to which death and the evils preceding it, &s;ubject us, we fall &s;hort of the require|ments of the law, and become actual &s;inners, even in the fir&s;t dawn of rea&s;on. The expre&s;&s;ions are, &s;ome of them, highly figurative, and when reduced to a proper and literal meaning, intend no more, than that we are all born under &s;uch di&s;abilities, as to be condemned by the law, and that being influenced, in our depraved nature, by a thou&s;and powerful temptations, we very &s;oon become actual tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of it, clearly evincing that the original &s;in of our fir&s;t father, is the prolifie &s;ource of all, even the mo&s;t early and aggravated per&s;onal offences. Here &s;uffer me to &s;ay, that however &s;ome per&s;ons deny the pernicious effects of Adam's &s;in to his po&s;terity; yet every unprejudiced man, who reads the &s;cripture with attention, mu&s;t perceive that the fall of man, is the foundation of the whole &s;cheme of go&s;pel grace. Hence the contra&s;t between Adam and Chri&s;t. And, in my opinion, a man might as well deny revelation in general, as to deny that the one man's di&s;obedience is the cau&s;e, in &s;ome way, or another, of all the &s;ins of mankind.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. IF men are, in con&s;equence of Adam's &s;in, all born de&s;titute of holine&s;s, hence we &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of regeneration, or the new birth to all the children of men, infants not excepted. On no other foundation can this doctrine, which all believe, &s;tand with &s;o much propriety, as on this. <HI>As without holine&s;s no man or per&s;on can &s;ee the Lord;</HI> and as upon my principles chil|dren are born without it; hence <HI>they,</HI> as well as the <HI>adult,</HI> mu&s;t be regenerated, or mu&s;t be excluded the kingdom of heaven. Some per&s;ons, from this principle, who are great &s;ticklers for ab|&s;olute unconditional decrees, have concluded, that &s;ome infants, dying at that period, are &s;ent down to the mi&s;eries of hell. But as I cannot believe the dreadful &s;entiment, I give the following rea&s;ons for my non-belief. 1&s;t. If the &s;entence pronounced a|gain&s;t Adam had been &s;trictly fulfilled, he never could have had any po&s;terity at all. But from anticipating a Saviour to come, his life was protracted, and opportunity granted for having children, who, without any fault of their own, are &s;ubjected to vanity and death. Now can we &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>God who &s;ent his Son into the world, not to condemn it, but that it might through him be &s;aved,</HI> would have rai&s;ed any, who had never been guilty of any per&s;on|al tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, from the grave, with a view to make them po&s;itively wretched? Where, on this &s;uppo&s;ition, is the grace of the Father, and the boundle&s;s compa&s;&s;ion of his Son? No, he never would have di&s;turbed their a&s;hes, but left them peacefully <HI>is have &s;lept out the Sabbath of the tomb,</HI> if he had not rai&s;ed them
<PB N="19" REF="023103_0018_0FBC3AD5A3BC4CD8">
for a better &s;tate. Be&s;ides, if this were not the ca&s;e, how could it be &s;aid of Adam's po&s;terity that the <HI>creature,</HI> meaning man, <HI>was made &s;ubject to vanity, not willingly, but by rea&s;on of him, who hath &s;ubjected the &s;ame in hope.</HI> The&s;e con&s;iderations make it extremely probable, that as a Saviour is provided, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s, in part, was to re&s;tore the lo&s;s we &s;u&s;tained by the lap&s;e, to re|cover from the penal effects and di&s;abilities of the fir&s;t man's &s;in, that no one was ever denied, who had not made it to all moral purpo&s;es his own, by the free choice of his will, in actual di&s;o|bedience. And that which is made probable from the character of God and his gracious de&s;ign in &s;ending a Saviour into the world, is rendered almo&s;t a certainty from the words of Chri&s;t, who knew his Father's will, and &s;till &s;pake very favorably of tho&s;e who fell in Adam, but <HI>had,</HI> and could <HI>have,</HI> no &s;ins of their own; <HI>&s;uffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not; for of &s;uch is the kingdom of heaven:</HI> And again, &s;peaking to the adult, he &s;ays, <HI>except to be converted and become as little children, ye &s;hall not elder into the kingdom of heaven.</HI> The pious and very ingenious Doctor Watts, entertained a peculiar &s;entiment, on this head, which was, that the children of believing parents, who never live to years of di&s;cretion, &s;hall be &s;aved; but that the children of unbelievers will never be rai&s;ed from the dead; &s;hall always re|main under the dominion of the grave, in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility. He could not admit the &s;hocking idea of thou&s;ands of little crea|tures weltering under the po&s;itive inflictions of the divine wrath! and to avoid it, had recour&s;e to the &s;cheme of thought above &s;ugge&s;ted. But as this militates with the notion that all &s;hall be rai&s;ed to life, a doctrine clearly held forth in &s;undry places of &s;cripture, the more rational opinion is, that all who die in in|fancy, will, through the grace of the go&s;pel, and the merit of the Redeemer, be &s;aved: but then it mu&s;t be by pa&s;&s;ing through the new birth, like tho&s;e who are adult. The main difference is, that tho&s;e who have come to the exerci&s;e of their mental powers, and have been guilty of many per&s;onal &s;ins, mu&s;t <HI>&s;eek</HI> for this change, <HI>de&s;ire</HI> to be <HI>born again,</HI> and made <HI>new creatures in Chri&s;t;</HI> otherwi&s;e their condition will be deplorable indeed: whereas, with regard to children the ca&s;e is different; for as the di&s;ability came without their fault, the recovery from it comes without their &s;eeking. Let me therefore, by way of conclu&s;ion, exhort all who are &s;till in their &s;ins, and are con&s;equently un&s;anctified, and unpardoned, to &s;eek tho&s;e gifts and gracious qualifications from Chri&s;t, the deliverer of our race, the friend of man; and to do it in the diligent u&s;e of tho&s;e means, which he has in&s;ti|tuted, by <HI>prayers, reading the word, meditation, and hearing.</HI> Re|membering

<P>THE apo&s;tacy and redemption of the human race are two mo&s;t memorable events in the hi&s;tory of the world; events de&s;erving our particular <HI>notice,</HI> our <HI>admiration,</HI> and I had almo&s;t &s;aid our <HI>gratitude;</HI> for &s;uch is the pre&s;ent &s;tate of mankind with re&s;pect to future happine&s;s, under the kingdom of the Me&s;|&s;iah, that it cannot be &s;aid that we are eventually lo&s;ers by the fall. Nay, it may well be que&s;tioned, whether the &s;ons of Ad|am in general, have not <HI>now</HI> a greater probability of &s;ecuring the la&s;ting felicity of their &s;ouls, &s;ince Chri&s;t has died for them, than if they never had fallen. This &s;eems to be an idea held forth by &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture; and on any other &s;uppo&s;ition, it is difficult to perceive how the <HI>&s;eed of the woman</HI> has <HI>brui&s;ed the &s;er|pent's head;</HI> or how in the conte&s;t between the&s;e two &s;eeds, the advantage on the whole is gained by Chri&s;t. But be this as it will, the <HI>lap&s;e</HI> and <HI>recovery</HI> of mankind, may be contemplated with admiration. They di&s;play the perfections of Deity in the mo&s;t illu&s;trious manner; they &s;hew the wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice, power and compa&s;&s;ion of God, in the cleare&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;picuous

light; as well as point out his &s;overeignty. That he &s;hould &s;uf|fer &s;in to come into the world, through the temptation of the devil; that he &s;hould bring good out of evil, provide a Saviour for fallen men, when he pa&s;&s;ed by the fallen angels; and that he &s;hould grant peace and pardon to the rebellious, through the death and &s;ufferings of his own Son, are matters which we can a&s;cribe only to the in&s;crutable wi&s;dom, boundle&s;s compa&s;&s;ion, and adorable &s;overeignty of God. The&s;e are matters of delightful contemplation to pious minds; and though neither <HI>men</HI> nor <HI>an|gels</HI> can comprehend the&s;e unfathomable coun&s;els of heaven; yet they are the theme of their devout adoration and prai&s;e. <HI>Glory to God in the highe&s;t, peace on earth and good will towards men.</HI> The fall of which the heathens were &s;en&s;ible, (though they knew not to what cau&s;e to a&s;cribe it) came by Adam; but the recovery from it comes by one greater man, the Lord from heaven. This is the <HI>one</HI> intended in our text, <HI>through who&s;e obedience many are made righteous.</HI> He is a counterpart to the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> and therefore called the <HI>&s;econd Adam. He was made a quickening &s;pirit, as the fir&s;t man Adam was made a living &s;oul.</HI> The &s;cripture, in plain and unequivocal language, repre&s;ents him as <HI>the Son of God, the fir&s;t born of every creature, the brightne&s;s of his Father's glory, and the expre&s;s image of his per&s;on.</HI> Nay, it &s;peaks of him as an incarnate God, <HI>the word made fle&s;h.</HI> Hence &s;ays St. John in the fir&s;t chap|ter of his go&s;pel; <HI>And the word was made fle&s;h, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, (the glory of the only begotten of the Fa|ther) full of grace and truth.</HI> To the &s;ame purpo&s;e is the follow|ing pa&s;&s;age in the 1&s;t Timothy, iiid chapter, 16th ver&s;e; <HI>Great is the my&s;tery of godline&s;s, God manife&s;t in the fle&s;h,</HI> &amp;c. for he took the nature of man into a clo&s;e, though inexplicable union with his divine per&s;on. <HI>He took not on him the nature of angels,</HI> becau&s;e for them he did not appear as a Saviour; <HI>but he took on him the &s;eed of Abraham, that he might redeem them from the grave.</HI> Agree|ably &s;ays the Apo&s;tle to the Hebrews, <HI>for as much as the children were partakers of fle&s;h and blood, he al&s;o him&s;elf likewi&s;e took part of the &s;ame; that through death he might de&s;troy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their life time &s;ubject to bondage.</HI> The nature of man was contained in him, as well as in the fir&s;t Adam; only with this very great advantage, that whereas the fir&s;t was but a <HI>mere man,</HI> made <HI>in the likene&s;s of God;</HI> the &s;econd was a divine per&s;on made in the &s;imilitude of man. Hence in the 2d chapter of Philippians, the Apo&s;tle thus &s;peaks concerning him: <HI>who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made him&s;elf of no rebutation; and took upon him the form of a &s;er|vant,
<PB N="22" REF="023103_0021_0FBC3ADD9EE6C440">
and was made in the</HI> LIKENESS <HI>of men,</HI> &amp;c. Thus much concerning THE ONE <HI>through who&s;e obedience many are made righte|ous.</HI> We &s;hall &s;ay &s;omething concerning this obedience, and &s;hew in what it con&s;i&s;ted. In order to treat of it in a methodical man|ner, I &s;hall divide it, according to the practice of ancient divines, into <HI>active</HI> and <HI>pa&s;&s;ive.</HI> With re&s;pect to his <HI>active</HI> obedience, the following things may be ob&s;erved. He was perfectly righteous or obedient prior to his a&s;&s;umption of the human nature, and remained &s;o ever after; and le&s;t he &s;hould be contaminated by his union with our nature, he <HI>was conceived of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> and in a miraculous manner born of a <HI>pure virgin. Behold a vir|gin &s;hall conceive and bare a &s;on, and &s;hall call his name Immanuel.</HI> I&s;aiah vii, 14. After that union which capacitated him to act as Mediator, his obedience was perfect in all in&s;tances. For though he was &s;ubject to the &s;inle&s;s infirmities of mankind, and needed to eat, drink and &s;up like tho&s;e for whom he mediated, yet he was never found chargeable with any &s;in. His obedience was <HI>univer&s;al, &s;incere, per&s;evering and perfect.</HI> Accordingly I&s;aiah, in the 53d chapter, &s;peaking of what was then future, as though it had really taken place, &s;ays concerning him, <HI>He had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.</HI> And St. John, after his advent, declares; <HI>Ye know that he was manife&s;t to take away our &s;ins, and in him is no &s;in.</HI> Chri&s;t was not only <HI>negatively,</HI> but <HI>po&s;itively</HI> righteous. He not only did not tran&s;gre&s;s, but po&s;itively fulfilled all the requi&s;itions of the law, both ceremo|nial and moral. <HI>Suffer it to be &s;o now,</HI> &s;aid he to John the Bap|ti&s;t, who endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade him from coming to his bap|ti&s;m, <HI>for thus it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> us to fulfil all righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> If he had been a &s;inner in any &s;en&s;e of the word, he could not have made reconciliation for the &s;ins of the world; becau&s;e the oblation of a &s;inful per&s;on would not have been an acceptable &s;acrifice to God. Agreeably we have the following &s;criptural declaration: <HI>Such an High Prie&s;t became us, who is holy, harmle&s;s, unde&s;ired and &s;eparate from &s;inners; who <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> not delay to offer up &s;acrifice, fir&s;t for his own &s;ins, and then for the people's; for this he did once, when he offered up him&s;elf: For the law maketh men high prie&s;ts who have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which is &s;ince the law, maketh the Son who is con&s;ecrated for ever more.</HI> Thus much concern|ing his <HI>active</HI> obedience. His <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> con&s;i&s;ted in tho&s;e a|mazing &s;ufferings he underwent, whil&s;t he tabernacled in the fle&s;h; the indignities, the in&s;ults and abu&s;es, which were thrown upon him, <HI>when he went about doing good both to the &s;ouls and bo|dies of men;</HI> and e&s;pecially in that cruel and ignominious death, which he &s;uffered on the cro&s;s. To &s;ee therefore in one lively

view, what the Saviour &s;uffered for our redemption; follow him in your minds to Mount Calvary; behold him &s;u&s;pended on the accur&s;ed tree, &s;uffering excrutiating pains in his body, having his tendons &s;tretched, and his fle&s;h lacerated by tho&s;e nails with which he was fa&s;tened to the cro&s;s; and al&s;o enduring that ex|treme angui&s;h of mind, under the hidings of his Father's coun|tenance, which cau&s;ed him to cry out in the bitterne&s;s of his &s;oul, <HI>My God! my God! why had thou for&s;aken me?</HI> Now by this <HI>active</HI> and <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> obedience of Chri&s;t, <HI>many are made righteous,</HI> in the following manner, viz. by <HI>imputation</HI> and <HI>inhe&s;ion.</HI> And 1&s;t by imputation. As Adam's &s;in; &s;o Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s is imput|ed. And as by the fir&s;t we are &s;ubjected to mortality, and mu&s;t &s;oon|er or later die; &s;o by the &s;econd we &s;hall be rai&s;ed from the dead. Had not Chri&s;t &s;tepped in to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and voluntarily &s;uf|fered death for fallen man, it would have had perpetual dominion over their bodies. But <HI>now as in Adam all die; &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive. There &s;hall be a re&s;urrection both of the ju&s;t and the unju&s;t. The time is coming, when all that are in their graves &s;hall hear the voice of the Son of God, and come forth; they that have done good to the re&s;urrection of life; and they that have done evil to the re&s;urrection of damnation.</HI> John v, 29. The grave cannot now boa&s;t a complete and la&s;ting victory over the bodies of men; for Chri&s;t having ari&s;en the fir&s;t fruits of them that &s;leep, has become a mighty conqueror, and virtually &s;ays to death and the grave, <HI>Oh death, I will be thy plague! Oh grave, I will be thy de&s;truction!</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. HIS obedience is imputed for our ju&s;tification, at the bar of God, from the condemning &s;entence of the law. The Apo&s;tle Paul repre&s;ents mankind, univer&s;ally, both Jews and Gentiles, in a &s;tate of condemnation, as having come &s;hort of the moral law, or the law of their nature. By this, we are <HI>all</HI> condemned, whether young or old, till we are ju&s;tified by the righteou&s;ne&s;s or obedience of Chri&s;t. This ju&s;tification, to tho&s;e in|capable of moral agency, comes, as does the re&s;urrection, without their &s;eeking. But to the adult it is the con&s;equence of faith, repent|ance, and renewed temper. But immediately on their faith in Chri&s;t, they are <HI>ju&s;tified from all things, from which they could not be ju&s;tified by the law,</HI> either of nature or <HI>of Mo&s;es.</HI> Now to &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of this, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the character of an holy and righteous God, to pronounce any one righteous unle&s;s he comes up to the demands of the law in all re&s;pects. But &s;ince the fall, no man is without &s;in; there is not a ju&s;t man on earth, who doeth good and &s;inneth not. Hence it is impo&s;&s;ible that any of the &s;ons of Adam &s;hould be
<PB N="24" REF="023103_0023_0FBC3AE09E034210">
ju&s;tified at the bar of God, unle&s;s they have a righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;u|perior to their own. Now this righteou&s;ne&s;s they enjoy by <HI>im|putation. Even as David de&s;cribed the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the man unto whom God imputeth righteou&s;ne&s;s without works.</HI> Romans iv, 6. <HI>Chri&s;t has fulfilled the law, has magnified and made it honorable;</HI> has obeyed its precept and &s;uffered its penalty; and by this means has atchieved a righteou&s;ne&s;s highly delectable to his Father. Hence we read, <HI>that the Lord is well plea&s;ed for his righteou&s;ne&s;s' &s;ake.</HI> Now this righteou&s;ne&s;s is the matter of the believer's ju&s;|tification before God; and it avails to his benefit by imputation; or in other words, it is &s;et down to his account; as St. Paul tells Philemon, <HI>if One&s;imus had wronged or owed him any thing, to put that on his account.</HI> In &s;hort, as a pious writer on another &s;ub|ject ob&s;erves, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doctor DODDRIDGE.</NOTE>"all manner of imputation is a metaphor taken from books of account between debtor and creditor. To im|pute any act of &s;in or obedience is to &s;et it down to his account. The great God is repre&s;ented in conde&s;cen&s;ion to our manner of acting and conceiving things, as keeping an exact book of records, by which our final account &s;hall be determined. And as the mo&s;t perfect obedience is a debt which we owe to him as our Creator, Pre&s;erver and Benefactor; &s;o on the breach of his law we owe him &s;ome proper &s;atisfaction. In this view, we are all, as the &s;ons of an apo&s;tate father, charged as in&s;olvent debtors in the book of God. Innumerable &s;ins are &s;et down, or imputed to our account. And were things to go on in this cour&s;e, we &s;hould, ere long, be arre&s;ted by the divine ju&s;tice; and being incapable of payment, &s;hould be ca&s;t into the pri&s;on of hell to come out no more. But God, in compa&s;&s;ion to our calamitous &s;tate, has found out a &s;urety and a ran&s;om for us; has provided a &s;atisfaction in the obedience and &s;ufferings of his Son. It is on the account of this, and from the complacency which God has in it, that all who are finally ju&s;tified meet the divine acceptance, and are delivered from that condemnation which has pa&s;&s;ed upon us all, as appears from the ver&s;e immediately preceding my text. In this ca&s;e, ac|cording to the metaphor mentioned above, the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t is in the book of God imputed or &s;et down to their ac|count, as that by which the debt is balanced, and they are en|titled to &s;uch exemptions and favors as righteous per&s;ons might expect from God. But then it is a fixed rule in the divine ad|mini&s;tration, that this obedience of Chri&s;t &s;hall be imputed to none but &s;uch as believe in him, or have the &s;eeds of holine&s;s in their hearts. But immediately upon this, they are treated as in|nocent per&s;ons, di&s;charged from their obligations to puni&s;hment,
<PB N="25" REF="023103_0024_0FBC3AE212F9AA80">
and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> in the divine favor." Now agreeably to this, our righteou&s;ne&s;s in &s;cripture is plainly a&s;&s;erted to be in Chri&s;t; God <HI>hath made him to be &s;in for us who know no &s;in, that we might be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God through him.</HI> 2 Corinthians, vth chap|ter, 21&s;t ver&s;e. In the &s;ame figurative manner are the following texts of &s;cripture to be under&s;tood, viz. that we are ju&s;tified by the obedience of Chri&s;t. <HI>All we like &s;heep have gone a&s;tray, but the Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all.</HI> I&s;aiah <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">., <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>I count all things but lo&s;s for the excellency of the knowledge of Je&s;us Chri&s;t my Lord, for which I have &s;uffered the lo&s;s of all things, and do count them but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> that I may win Chri&s;t, and be found in him, not having mine own righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Chri&s;t, the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of God by faith.</HI> Accordingly Chri&s;t is expre&s;sly called <HI>our righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>the Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> as in the Prophet Jeremiah. In a &s;en&s;e analogous to this, he is called, <HI>our &s;urely,</HI> or <HI>our &s;pon&s;or;</HI> and, for every believer, hath cancelled his obligation to puni&s;hment. His whole obedience on earth was for the &s;ake of &s;inners. <HI>In the fulne&s;s of time God &s;ent forth his Son, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the fle&s;h, God &s;ending his own Son, in the likene&s;s of &s;inful fle&s;h; and for &s;in, or being made a &s;acrifice for &s;in, hath condemned &s;in in the fle&s;h; that the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the fle&s;h, but after the &s;pirit.</HI> The&s;e texts are only a &s;mall part of what <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> be quot|ed to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. So that it appears, no doctrine is more amply &s;upported, than that of our ju&s;tification through the obe|dience of Chri&s;t. I have ob&s;erved already, that the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions are figurative; and the true literal meaning of them, I &s;uppo&s;e, is the following, viz. That as man had fallen and broken the divine law, it was nece&s;&s;ary that &s;omething &s;hould be done to re|pair the injury, and &s;ave, harmle&s;s, the perfections of God in the ju&s;tification and &s;alvation of guilty men. If an ea&s;y pardon had been granted them, without any &s;atisfaction made, the cha|racter of the Deity, as a righteous and holy Governor, would have been le&s;&s;ened in the view of his moral creatures. They would have &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;in was a light and trivial matter, and would have been encouraged to trample on his laws and de&s;pi&s;e his authority for the future. But, to pre&s;erve, in the view of &s;urrounding intelligences, the dignity of his government, and the rectitude of his character, he &s;aw fit to pardon their offences only on condition of his own Son, being a voluntary &s;ub&s;ti|tute, and &s;uffering in their &s;tead; hereby plainly demon&s;trating, that his laws were not to be tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed with impunity; that <HI>&s;in is the abominable thing which his &s;oul hateth;</HI> and that he main|tains
<PB N="26" REF="023103_0025_0FBC3AE4B12EDDB8">
a moral government over rational and free agents. Though no example exactly &s;imilar to this can be produced among men, yet the matter may be in a degree illu&s;trated, by the following &s;tory of a King, who, in order to di&s;courage the heinous practice of adultery among his &s;ubjects, ordained, that whoever was guilty of this crime in future, &s;hould be puni&s;hed with the lo&s;s of both his eyes. His only &s;on was the fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;or. He had great affection for him, and could not contemplate the idea of making him completely wretched, without the mo&s;t painful &s;en&s;ations; and yet the dignity of his law and government <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be main|tained. In this exigency, in order at once to manife&s;t his ju&s;tice as a legi&s;lator, and his compa&s;&s;ion as a father, he put out one of his own, and one of the eyes of his &s;on. Thus, in a way &s;ome|what analagous, God hath &s;et forth his Son, <HI>to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteou&s;ne&s;s for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins that are pa&s;t; that he might be ju&s;t, and the ju&s;tifier of him who believeth in Je&s;us.</HI> So that now in granting pardon to the penitent, on the &s;ufferings and merit of his Son, who willingly &s;ubmitted to die in their room, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> di&s;plays both his righte|ou&s;ne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion. And &s;peaking in reference to this meth|od of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> mankind, the P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays, <HI>Mercy and truth have met together, righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace have ki&s;&s;ed each other.</HI></P>
<P>BEFORE I proceed to the next particular, I &s;hall only make this ob&s;ervation, viz. that though it is abundantly evident from what has been already &s;aid, that Chri&s;t's obedience is imputed in its legal re&s;ult, or meritorious effects, to the believer, for his ju&s;tification from the condemning &s;entence of the law; yet it is not his <HI>inherent,</HI> or <HI>per&s;onal obedience.</HI> As &s;in in this &s;en&s;e cannot be transferred from one per&s;on to another; &s;o neither can righteou&s;ne&s;s. Sin and righteou&s;ne&s;s, in this &s;en&s;e, are the effects of moral agency; of per&s;onal obedience, and di&s;obedience; the abu&s;e or right im|provement of our own mental and moral faculties. Hence &s;aith St. John, <HI>little children, be not deceived, he that doth righteou&s;ne&s;s is righteous.</HI> There &s;eems to be the greater nece&s;&s;ity of mentioning this; &s;ince it is known in fact, that &s;ome per&s;ons tru&s;t to the imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t alone, not only for ju&s;tification at the bar of God in the pre&s;ent world, but for &s;alvation at the tribunal of Chri&s;t in the future; and are ready to &s;ay that Chri&s;t has done all, and men have nothing to do in order to be &s;aved. This is a dangerous mi&s;take, founded on the fal&s;e apprehen&s;ion that the per&s;onal obedience of the Saviour is, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, the per&s;onal obedience of the &s;inner, or rather of the believer. That this cannot be true, is evident from this &s;ingle con&s;idera|tion; that then every per&s;on, participating of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;|ne&s;s through faith, mu&s;t be equally holy, and equally entitled to

reward. But the whole &s;cope of the Bible teaches the contrary. It tells us that &s;ome are more righteous than others; and that different degrees of happine&s;s will be a&s;&s;igned to men in the fu|ture &s;tate; that whil&s;t &s;ome &s;hall &s;hine only <HI>as the brightne&s;s of the firmament,</HI> others <HI>&s;hall &s;hine as the &s;tars</HI> which are much more re&s;plendent, <HI>for ever and ever.</HI> All therefore that can po&s;&s;ibly be meant by the imputation of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s to the believer is, that they are delivered from the condemnation of God's law, by means of it, and placed under a covenant of grace, by the terms of which, if they are &s;incere, though not perfect in their obedience, they &s;hall be accepted, and rai&s;ed hereafter to a de|gree of happine&s;s exactly proportioned to their improvements in holy and virtuous obedience.</P>
<P>THIS leads me to &s;ay thirdly, that by <HI>the obedience of one many are made inherently righteous.</HI> This inherent holine&s;s is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to qualify any per&s;on for the kingdom of heaven; <HI>for without holine&s;s no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord.</HI> Now this is the effect of Chri&s;t's obedience unto death, and not the mere con&s;equence of fallen man's own endeavours without divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the operations of the &s;pirit of God upon his heart. Man is now &s;o lo&s;t to every principle of holi|ne&s;s, &s;o &s;unk in &s;en&s;e, and under the dominion of corrupt fle&s;hly appetites, that unle&s;s his powers are &s;trengthened by divine a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, he would for ever go on in a way of di&s;obedience and rebellion. Chri&s;t therefore, that he might perfect his work of redemption, and become a complete Saviour, has not only vin|dicated the believer from the damnatory &s;entence of a broken law, but tenders, by his &s;pirit, help to comply with the condi|tions of the go&s;pel covenant. This &s;pirit, in his beneficial ope|rations, our Saviour purcha&s;ed by his &s;ufferings; and when he a&s;cended to heaven, &s;ent him down to a&s;&s;i&s;t mankind under their great weakne&s;&s;es; to alleviate their burthens and to comfort their hearts; to arou&s;e them to a &s;erious con&s;ideration of their &s;piritu|al intere&s;ts; to mortify their lu&s;ts; to in&s;pire them with &s;orrow for their &s;ins; to lead them to repentance; to &s;anctify their na|ture; and animate them to the con&s;cientious performance of GOOD WORKS; or in the language of &s;cripture, <HI>to reprove,</HI> or con|vince <HI>the world, of &s;in, of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and of judgment.</HI> Now the &s;pirit, which may be re&s;i&s;ted, operates on the hearts of men in a way con&s;entaneous to their rational nature. And as rea&s;on|able creatures we ought to cooperate with him, and in this way to be <HI>workers together with God;</HI> that we may <HI>be &s;ealed to the day of redemption;</HI> or in the expre&s;s language of &s;cripture, <HI>we mu&s;t work out our &s;alvation with fear and trembling; for it is God that worketh in us both to will and to do of his own good plea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="023103_0027_0FBC3AEB4C72EF78">BEFORE I come to the improvement, it is proper that I &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething to that particular mode of expre&s;&s;ion in the text, from which &s;ome men have inferred the doctrine of <HI>univer&s;al &s;alvation.</HI> The word <HI>many,</HI> in the former part of the text, intends <HI>all,</HI> as I have already told you. In the latter clau&s;e it is to be under&s;tood in a &s;en&s;e equally exten&s;ive. Now what rational and con&s;i&s;tent meaning can we put on this expre&s;&s;ion, if we do not grant that <HI>all</HI> will be finally &s;aved? As, therefore, I do not believe the even|tual &s;alvation of all men, it becomes me to &s;how how this term can be explained in con&s;i&s;tency with my own, and the common per&s;ua&s;ion. I an&s;wer in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, that by the obedience of Chri&s;t, <HI>all</HI> &s;hall be rai&s;ed from the dead, which is one thing ev|idently intended <HI>by all being made righteous.</HI> 2dly. The &s;acrifice of Chri&s;t was <HI>intentionally</HI> for <HI>all;</HI> and there is virtue enough in his death to atone, or &s;atisfy for the &s;ins of <HI>all</HI> the &s;ons of Adam. Hence we read, <HI>that he died for all; that he ta&s;ted death for every man; that he was a propitiation for our &s;ins, and not for ours only, but for the &s;ins of the whole world;</HI> from which, and &s;undry other &s;imilar pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, we learn, that <HI>univer&s;al redemption</HI> is a true doctrine. My meaning is, Chri&s;t did not &s;o die for any par|ticular number of mankind, as to exclude the remainder, or leave them in a hopele&s;s condition; but by removing impediments out of the way, has rendered &s;alvation po&s;&s;ible to <HI>all,</HI> &s;o that if they do not attain it, the fault is wholly their own. But 3dly. The nature of religion, as well as the nature of man, makes it for ever nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould maintain a di&s;tinction, between the <HI>offer,</HI> and the <HI>acceptance</HI> of &s;alvation on the terms of the go&s;pel. The offer we mu&s;t believe is by God in &s;incerity made to <HI>all,</HI> and unle&s;s we would reflect great di&s;honor on the &s;incerity of our heavenly Father, mu&s;t believe that &s;piritual a&s;&s;i&s;tances are tender|ed to <HI>all,</HI> &s;ufficient to enable them to repent and believe. But then though this be very true, the nature of religion obliges us to conclude, that it is in the <HI>power,</HI> and experience teaches us that it is often times in the <HI>will</HI> of man, to re&s;i&s;t the &s;trivings of the &s;pirit; <HI>to reject the coun&s;el of God again&s;t them&s;elves, and receive his grace in vain.</HI> This re&s;ults from that liberty in man which he &s;till retains, &s;ince the apo&s;tacy; and is nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute him a free agent, in the mo&s;t proper &s;en&s;e of the word: for the idea, <HI>that liberty con&s;i&s;ts altogether in voluntarine&s;s,</HI> and <HI>is not to be oppo&s;ed to nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> mu&s;t be rejected, as without &s;ufficient founda|tion either in rea&s;on or &s;cripture. Now, if this idea of liberty be rational, that the redemption from the cur&s;e of the law be by Chri&s;t purcha&s;ed for <HI>all;</HI> and grace &s;ufficient to enable them to comply with the conditions of the go&s;pel covenant, be offered to <HI>all,</HI> yet &s;till it is in the compa&s;s of man's <HI>power</HI> to reject the prof|fered
<PB N="29" REF="023103_0028_0FBC3AEC94C9ABA8">
good. And that this is often done by the &s;inful children of men, &s;cripture and experience abundantly convince us. Some become holy, whil&s;t others remain wicked. And to the&s;e dif|ferent characters, a proper retribution is a&s;&s;igned by the <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> of God, in the future world. The righteous at death will be admitted to eternal life; and why may we not &s;uppo&s;e that the wicked, at the &s;ame period, &s;hall be &s;ent down to eternal puni&s;hment? We have as much rea&s;on from revelation to believe the one as the other. St. Matthew, &s;peaking by in&s;piration, tells us, <HI>the&s;e,</HI> that is the wicked of whom he had ju&s;t before been &s;peaking, <HI>&s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment; but the righte|ous into life eternal.</HI> Yet it is to be ob&s;erved that the epithet in the Greek, is in both places the &s;ame, and therefore from this text we have as much rea&s;on to believe the eternal damnation of the wicked, as the eternal &s;alvation of the righteous. But <HI>&s;ome</HI> tell us that the words <HI>for ever, everla&s;ting,</HI> &amp;c. do not always intend or imply a &s;trict eternity. It is readily granted. But does the text ju&s;t now quoted, &s;ufficiently prove the eternal happine&s;s of the righteous, as all believe? Why does it not al&s;o prove the endle&s;s mi&s;ery of the wicked? The one is expre&s;&s;ed in as &s;trong terms as the other. Still it has been &s;aid by the fautors of uni|ver&s;al &s;alvation, that God is held to fulfil his promi&s;es, but not his threatenings; becau&s;e if he does not fulfil his promi&s;es, he does an injury to his creatures, as di&s;appointing them of an ex|pected good: but if he forbears to execute his threatenings, he leaves his creatures better than they expected. Very true. But where is the truth and rectoral holine&s;s of the great Governor of the world, on this &s;uppo&s;ition? <HI>Let God be true though every man be a liar.</HI> Others tell us, that though all who die impenitent &s;hall be doomed to mi&s;ery <HI>awfully long and &s;evere,</HI> yet that they &s;hall &s;ooner or later be recovered by means of their torments, to an holy temper, and their puni&s;hments &s;hall finally cea&s;e. But how can they certainly tell this? From what text in the Bible, con|&s;i&s;tently interpreted, do they infer this conclu&s;ion? How do they certainly know that the future world will be a world of proba|tion? St. John, in the Apocalyp&s;e, &s;eems to repre&s;ent this mat|ter in a different light; for &s;peaking of the time of death, or of the general judgment, he &s;ays, <HI>He that is unju&s;t let him be unju&s;t &s;till; and he that is filthy let him be filthy &s;till; and he that is righte|ous let him be righteous &s;till; and he that is holy let him be holy &s;till.</HI> Rev. xxii chapter, 11 ver&s;e. The&s;e words, I think, cannot po&s;|&s;ibly be better explained than by interpreting them to this &s;en&s;e, that there will be no alteration in men's characters after death, and the time of probation ends with the pre&s;ent world. But granting we are mi&s;taken in our interpretation of them, and the
<PB N="30" REF="023103_0029_0FBC3AEE5399BEF8">
time of probation &s;hall continue in the future world, through many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;tates, how can we certainly &s;ay, that tho&s;e who die impenitent in this world, &s;hall be recovered to a penitent temper in the future? If we acknowledge that men, in order to be righteous or wicked, mu&s;t have liberty to chu&s;e or refu&s;e, to repent or rebel; and that &s;uch a liberty con&s;titutes them moral agents, the &s;ubjects of prai&s;e or blame, of rewards or puni&s;h|ments, how can we certainly know how they will conduct under any given circum&s;tances? Is it po&s;&s;ible for us, on this &s;uppo&s;i|tion, to pronounce that any quantity of puni&s;hment, let it be ever &s;o long and &s;evere, will reclaim them to a better temper! And yet it is a matter of publick notoriety, that the be&s;t writers, in favor of univer&s;al &s;alvation, believe that men are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the liberty abovementioned, and that without an holy temper none can be happy. In a&s;&s;erting, therefore, that <HI>all</HI> &s;hall be &s;aved, &s;uch per&s;ons contradict their own principles, and cut up the ground on which they &s;tand; or at lea&s;t form conclu&s;ions, which, from their premi&s;es, are infallibly precarious. Since therefore every text of &s;cripture which &s;eems to countenance the doctrine of <HI>the &s;alvation of all men,</HI> is fully explained on the &s;uppo&s;ition of the doctrine of univer&s;al redemption, as I have above explained it; and &s;ince the notion that a certain degree of puni&s;hment, will inevitably recover the wicked to an holy temper, militates with the e&s;&s;ential liberty of man; and e&s;pecially, &s;ince we know that the in&s;tituted means of grace, and all God's providential di&s;pen|&s;ations, intermingled with mercy and puni&s;hment, with &s;everity and kindne&s;s, have never, in this world, (confe&s;&s;edly a &s;tate of probation,) been &s;ufficient to reclaim certain characters; but not|with&s;tanding they die in a &s;tate of impenitency, and con&s;equently out of favor with God; we may conclude, that the rea&s;onings of tho&s;e who are advocates for the final &s;alvation of all men, are extremely inconclu&s;ive and precarious. And hence we cannot act a more rational part, than to believe in the <HI>expre&s;s words,</HI> and <HI>mo&s;t probably</HI> in the <HI>very &s;en&s;e</HI> of &s;cripture, that the <HI>wicked &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment.</HI> But when I &s;ay this I will not di&s;&s;emble, that the doctrine of eternal torments for the tempora|ry and tran&s;ient acts of men, is attended with <HI>great</HI> difficulties, when viewed in the light of rea&s;on, and &s;ome <HI>&s;mall</HI> ones when contemplated in the gla&s;s of revelation. It is impo&s;&s;ible for me with certainty to declare, that all men &s;hall not, through the good|ne&s;s of God, and the &s;uperabounding merit of his &s;on's obedi|ence to death, be finally reduced from mi&s;ery, after an awful pe|riod of &s;ufferings, inten&s;e in degree and long in duration. Great|ly rejoiced &s;hould I be, could I pronounce this with certainty from the &s;acred pages: for nothing more delights me than the
<PB N="31" REF="023103_0030_0FBC3AEFF13A2858">
contemplation of the happine&s;s of the <HI>whole world.</HI> But the force of truth, according to my pre&s;ent ideas, con&s;trains me to believe otherwi&s;e. However, let this doctrine be decided as it will, yet of this one thing we may be ab&s;olutely certain, that &s;in|ners act with great imprudence, who allow them&s;elves in wick|edne&s;s, under an expectation that they will be gainers by their impenetency in a cour&s;e of &s;in; for though we &s;hould allow that there is great plea&s;ure in &s;inning, even much greater than in keeping the divine commands; yet if God the &s;upreme Lawgiver, be wi&s;e as well as righteous, we may pre&s;ume, that under his gov|ernment, the pains attending the puni&s;hment annexed to the breach of his laws, &s;hall exceed all the plea&s;ures of &s;in; for oth|erwi&s;e he has &s;o framed his laws as to be, on the whole, an en|couragement to rebels. Now our ideas of God teach us that this cannot po&s;&s;ibly be; becau&s;e he would not, on this &s;uppo&s;ition, be a wi&s;e Legi&s;lator. If there be really a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments, both the puni&s;hments and the rewards, mu&s;t be very incon&s;iderable indeed, not to make it worth a man's while to live a life of obedience: For if God's laws were given to &s;e|cure this obedience, he certainly mu&s;t have annexed &s;uch puni&s;h|ments &s;o long and &s;evere to the breach of them, as to make it the intere&s;t of all to obey; and their exceeding great folly to tran&s;gre&s;s. It is in vain therefore for per&s;ons to &s;pend their time in zealous di&s;putes about the <HI>nature</HI> or the duration of <HI>hell tor|ments,</HI> with a view to &s;olace or encourage them&s;elves in &s;in; for let this doctrine of final &s;alvation for all men be decided as it will; of this we mu&s;t have the fulle&s;t conviction, and the mo&s;t indubitable a&s;&s;urance, that the impenitent &s;inner &s;hall, upon bal|ancing the pains and plea&s;ures of &s;in, find him&s;elf a lo&s;er; and mu&s;t in the end confe&s;s that he &s;inned contrary to all the dictates of wi&s;dom and prudence, and &s;tands ju&s;tly obnoxious to the im|putation of extreme folly: <HI>The fear of the Lord is wi&s;dom, and to depart from evil is under&s;tanding.</HI> Thus, to make the word <HI>many,</HI> in the latter clau&s;e of the ver&s;e, as exten&s;ive as it is in the former, without recurring to the doctrine, that all men will eventually be &s;aved, by the obedience of one, we have only gone upon the principle of <HI>univer&s;al redemption,</HI> which is doubtle&s;s an important truth, and have taken into our con&s;ideration the liberty of the will in all matters of real and per&s;onal righteou&s;ne&s;s, and its frequent abu&s;e in the refu&s;al of the greate&s;t good; for the many, in the fulle&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word, &s;hall be made righteous, as delivered from the power of the grave, in which no moral agency can be exerted; yet none are made righteous or inherently holy, except|ing tho&s;e who voluntarily concur with the gracious purpo&s;es of God in the death of his dear Son; con&s;equently, though Chri&s;t
<PB N="32" REF="023103_0031_0FBC3AF11EE14218">
died for all, that all through him might live &s;piritually and eter|nally, as well as naturally; yet not all not concurring in this plan of grace, not rightly improving their own moral powers, they do not become inherently holy; and therefore <HI>peri&s;h,</HI> though for them <HI>Chri&s;t died.</HI></P>
<P>IN the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, I have run a parallel between the &s;in of Adam, and the obedience of Chri&s;t, and their re&s;pective effects on the children of men, the one reducing to death, the other rai&s;ing to life; the one making them &s;inners, and the other righte|ous; the one condemning, and the other ju&s;tifying, &amp;c. Yet to the honor of my Saviour, and in compliance with the declara|tions of &s;cripture, I am con&s;trained to declare that the antithe&s;is, or parallel, is not, in all re&s;pects, exact; for the obedience of Chri&s;t avails to deliver from more penal effects, than tho&s;e to which we were &s;ubjected by Adam's di&s;obedience. There is more me|rit in the one, than demerit in the other. Hence the Apo&s;tle, in this very chapter, &s;ays; <HI>But not as the offence &s;o al&s;o is the free gift; for if through the offence of one, many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, hath abounded unto many.</HI> And again, <HI>not as it was by one that &s;inned, &s;o is the gift: for the judgment was by one &s;in to condemnation; but the free gift is of many offences unto ju&s;tification; for if by one man's offence death reigned by one, much more they who receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hall reign in life by Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> which in few words may be explained to the following &s;en&s;e; the obedience of Chri&s;t not only delivers the believer from all the penal effects of Adam's &s;in, but from the evil con&s;equences of their own tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, be they ever &s;o numerous.</P>

<P N="1">1&s;t. FROM the repre&s;entation given above, we learn, that we are under infinite obligations to God for the gift of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the redemption of fallen man from all the effect of Adam's and our own per&s;onal offences. Though it does not be|come us to &s;ay, that God could not in any other way have re|deemed man from the wretched con&s;equences of the <HI>fall,</HI> than by the death of his only begotten Son; yet we know that this was a mo&s;t glorious method, by which at once to di&s;play, his dignity as a righteous Governor, and his infinite compa&s;&s;ion to fallen man.

all wi&s;dom and prudence. O the depth of the riches both of the wi&s;dom and knowledge of God; how un&s;earchable are his judgments, and his ways pa&s;t finding out!</HI> Let us adore with mo&s;t profound &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion and gratitude, this a&s;toni&s;hing method of &s;alvation by the in|carnation of his Son; and whil&s;t we rejoice that every man may be &s;aved if he <HI>will,</HI> let us endeavour, by the right improvement of our own powers, to be in the happy number of tho&s;e to whom the Redeemer &s;hall &s;ay, <HI>Come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</HI> All that Chri&s;t has done and &s;uffered for the apo&s;tate &s;ons of Adam, will no further avail the adult, than to rai&s;e them from the dead, un|le&s;s they believe and repent, and are found in the number of tho&s;e who comply with go&s;pel grace, in the religious improve|ment of tho&s;e moral powers, which God has given them, for the &s;trengthening of which he proffers the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his holy &s;pirit. Salvation is now made po&s;&s;ible to us, but none will final|ly &s;ecure it, notwith&s;tanding all that Chri&s;t has done and &s;uffer|ed, unle&s;s we diligently improve tho&s;e means of grace which are within our reach, and in the compa&s;s of our power. Though all moral impediments on the part of God are now removed by the death and mediatory undertaking of his Son; yet none can be &s;aved who have arrived to years of rea&s;on, and do not improve it, in a hearty compliance with tho&s;e terms and conditions which the go&s;pel propo&s;es. Some per&s;ons have made mo&s;t dangerous mi&s;takes on this &s;ubject, as &s;uppo&s;ing that every thing is done for them by Chri&s;t; whereas the true &s;tate of the ca&s;e is this only, that our Saviour has delivered us from the condemning &s;entence of the law, and placed us under the gracious con&s;titution of the go&s;pel covenant, by which perfect obedience is not required for &s;alvation. But then it requires a <HI>&s;incere</HI> and <HI>holy obedience</HI> to the law of faith, in the performance of which our own endeavours are nece&s;&s;ary: if we do not exert them, it had been better for us if Chri&s;t had never appeared in our world, and died in our &s;tead. His death therefore does not &s;uper&s;ede the nece&s;&s;ity of the diligent improvement of our time and talents; and when we have offended, of repentance; but only makes them available to pardon and final &s;ecurity. Too much cannot be &s;aid on this &s;ubject in this connexion; for men are not mechanically made holy, nor &s;ent to heaven without their own voluntary con&s;ent. We &s;hall be rai&s;ed from the dead, whether we chu&s;e or not; <HI>for there &s;hall be a re&s;urrection both of the ju&s;t and unju&s;t;</HI> but none go to heaven if they have arrived to years of di&s;cretion, without a proper improvement of their own powers, in the u&s;e of tho&s;e means which Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed, and now &s;incerely tenders to the children of men.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="023103_0033_0FBC3AF422E7B6F8">LET me therefore, in the &s;econd place, exhort you all to put your tru&s;t in Chri&s;t for pardon and acceptance; and let it be done in the proper u&s;e of your own mental abilities. You are not like the Jews of old, <HI>to go about to e&s;tabli&s;h a righteou&s;ne&s;s of your own, in order for ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of God,</HI> for your be&s;t performances as falling &s;hort of the law, which requires <HI>perfect un&s;inning obedience,</HI> in this view are of no avail, and <HI>are but filthy rags.</HI> But that you may be intere&s;ted in the perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, and may be not only ju&s;tified, but &s;anctified, and made meet for the kingdom of heaven, you mu&s;t lean to him and de|pend on him, not only for pardon by his obedience, but for &s;anctification by his &s;pirit. As your greate&s;t exertions will not bring you to a full compliance with the moral law; &s;o neither will your own endeavours, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tances of Chri&s;t's &s;pirit, po&s;&s;e&s;s you of a covenant holine&s;s. Look to him therefore, de|pend on him, as a whole and complete Saviour; <HI>whole and complete,</HI> as not only ju&s;tifying you by his righteou&s;ne&s;s, but as &s;anctifying you by his holy &s;pirit. Plead therefore his righteou&s;ne&s;s for your ju&s;tification at the bar of God, and depend on his go&s;pel and &s;pirit, in the diligent u&s;e of the means of grace for tho&s;e holy qual|ifications, without which you cannot be prepared for the happi|ne&s;s of heaven. Had it not been for the kind advent of the Sa|viour, we mu&s;t all have been for ever condemned by the law to a &s;tate of perpetual mi&s;ery; but &s;ince his arrival, none &s;hall be made happy in heaven, but tho&s;e who are ju&s;tified by his righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;anctified by his &s;pirit. And this &s;pirit we enjoy, to any &s;aving purpo&s;e, only in the way of go&s;pel obedience, and by a &s;erious attention to the means of grace. Let me then exhort you to <HI>pray,</HI> to <HI>read,</HI> and <HI>hear,</HI> to live a life of holy obedience, and when you have done the utmo&s;t in your abilities, &s;ay, <HI>that you are but unprofitable &s;ervants; that you have done no more than your duty,</HI> and ca&s;t your&s;elves on the mercy of God through Chri&s;t, hoping for eternal &s;alvation only through his &s;acrifice, who died the ju&s;t for the unju&s;t, that he might bring them to God, not only in acts of wor&s;hip <HI>here,</HI> but to endle&s;s felicity in the coming world.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. LET us live as becometh righteous and holy per&s;ons. We &s;hould not only be careful that our hearts are right with God, but that our external practice is right in the &s;ight of the world. If the &s;aints cannot fall <HI>finally,</HI> they certainly can fall <HI>faulty.</HI> That our religion may not be <HI>evil &s;poken of,</HI> it becomes them, <HI>to let their light &s;o &s;hine before men, that others &s;eeing their good works may glorify their heavenly Father. They &s;hould provide things <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> as it is tran&s;lated, but <HI>honorable,</HI> as it &s;hould have

been, <HI>in the &s;ight of all men, that their good may not be evil &s;poken of.</HI> It is highly incumbent in true believers, to walk in wi&s;dom be|fore others, and demon&s;trate by the holine&s;s and piety of their conver&s;ation, that they are the &s;aved of the Lord, that they have felt the power of religion on their &s;ouls, in its renewing and tran&s;|forming influences. In this way we be&s;t recommend the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; and exhibit the mo&s;t illu&s;trious proofs of its divinity to others. In this way we &s;hall mo&s;t effectually di&s;arm unbeliev|ers of their prejudices again&s;t Chri&s;t, and the purity of his doctrines; and finally in this way, contribute &s;ucce&s;sfully to &s;pread the triumphs of his cro&s;s!</P>
