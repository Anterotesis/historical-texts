<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS it's likely the following <HI>Treaty</HI> may fall into the Hands of many Per&s;ons who are unac|quainted with, or have any Idea of, the Power, Strength, and Confederacy of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> of <HI>In|dians,</HI> their pre&s;ent <HI>Tributaries, Dependents, Allies,</HI> and <HI>Form of Government</HI>; I judg'd the publi&s;hing the following in&s;tructive and entertaining Account of them, might be u&s;eful; and the more &s;o, as it never was made Publick 'til lately, that it was communi|cated to a Friend, by a Per&s;on

<P><HI>Cone&s;togo Indians</HI> have been all de&s;troyed by the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> except a few whom the <HI>Onoyders</HI> adopted: When the&s;e had forgot their Language, they were &s;ent back to <HI>Cone&s;togo,</HI> where a few are now left, and &s;peak the <HI>Onoyder</HI>'s Language.</P>

<P>Thus far proceeds CONRAD WEISER'S Account.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now give the be&s;t Account I could collect, of their <HI>RELIGION,</HI> and <HI>Form of GOVERNMENT.</HI> As to their <HI>RELIGION,</HI> It appears from &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages in their Treaties with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that they believe in <HI>One GOD,</HI> the Creator of the Univer&s;e; that there is a future State of Rewards and Puni&s;hments; the Influence of evil Spirits upon human Actions. As a Reward to the fir&s;t Founders of their Union, they believe them to be now Gods in Heaven. Their Form of Wor&s;hip I have not learnt. Upon the Whole, they &s;eem to be the be&s;t Sort of <HI>Dei&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>Their <HI>Form of GOVERNMENT,</HI> is a Council of their olde&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t Men, who have been great Warri|ours: Every one of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> have &s;uch a Council, in which all Matters relating to that Na|ture, are determin'd: And if it is of great Moment, they con&s;ult their young Warriours, and the Bu&s;ine&s;s is debated with great Deliberation. In Foreign Af|fairs, which relate to the Union in general, every one of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> &s;ends Deputies out of their Coun|cil, to a General Council; and this General Council, as well as the Particular Ones, con&s;ult the young Warriours, and have their Concurrence, before any Matter of great Con&s;equence is determined. All their Debates in Council, are manag'd with great Decency and Deliberation; and the Re&s;olution is imprinted in 
<PB N="ix" REF="005417_0009_10182C32712E6888">
the Memory of One cho&s;en from among them, of great Reputation and Elocution, who is appointed to &s;peak in Publick. He is a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a Prompter, who puts him in Mind of any Thing he forgets. They have no coercive Power over their young Warriours; they can only per&s;uade and admoni&s;h; nor have they any Pu|ni&s;hment but Death; Crimes that by their Laws do not de&s;erve that, are forgiven, after proper Reproofs.</P>
<P>When any Propo&s;als are made by them, in their Treaties with the white People, or by the white Peo|ple to them, they make the <HI>Io&mdash;hau,</HI> or Shout of <HI>Approbation,</HI> which is performed thus: The Speaker, after a Pau&s;e, in a &s;low Tone pronounces the <HI>U&mdash;huy</HI>; all the other <HI>Sachems</HI> in perfect Silence: So &s;oon as be &s;tops, they all with one Voice, in exact Time, be|gin one general <HI>Io',</HI> rai&s;ing and falling their Voices as the Arch of a Circle, and then rai&s;e it as high as at fir&s;t, and &s;top at the Height at once, in exact Time; and if it is of great Con&s;equence, the Speaker gives the <HI>U&mdash;huy</HI> thrice, and they make the Shout as often. It is u&s;ual, when the white Peo|ple &s;peak to them, as they give a Belt or String of <HI>Wampum,</HI> for the <HI>Interpreter</HI> to begin the <HI>U&mdash;huy,</HI> and the <HI>Indians</HI> to make the Shout.</P>
<P>The <HI>Six Nations,</HI> as was ob&s;erved before, border upon the Provinces of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> and <HI>New-York:</HI> The re&s;t, which are mentioned as their <HI>Dependents</HI> and <HI>Allies,</HI> lye near the <HI>French</HI> Settlements, &s;ome amid&s;t, and &s;ome beyond them. The <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of the <HI>Chiefs</HI> in this <HI>Con&s;ederacy</HI> hath gained them no le&s;s <HI>Reputation</HI> than their <HI>courage</HI>; which indeed has &s;truck <HI>Terror</HI> into the remote&s;t <HI>Indian</HI> Nations of North <HI>America,</HI> and forc'd them to court the Friend&s;hip and Protection of &s;uch a formidable Power.</P>

The <HI>Moderation</HI> and <HI>Equity</HI> of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Proprietor of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> gained the ab&s;olute Confidence and Affection of this <HI>brave People:</HI> They were convinced of his <HI>Tenderne&s;s</HI> for them, and in Return they have erected him la&s;ting Monuments in their grateful Hearts: They <HI>revere</HI> this good Man's <HI>Memory,</HI> and his Prai&s;es will only <HI>cea&s;e</HI> with the Nations them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>The following Clau&s;es from a Collection of <HI>Charters,</HI> &amp;c. printea at <HI>Philadelphia 1740,</HI> are, among&s;t many others, &s;trong Proofs of the <HI>Proprietor</HI>'s equitable Regard to the&s;e People.</P>
<Q><P>That no Man, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> &s;hall by any Ways or Means, in Word or Deed, affront or wrong any <HI>Indian</HI>; but he &s;hall incur the &s;ame Penalty of the Law, as if he had committed it again&s;t his <HI>fellow Planter:</HI> And if any <HI>Indian</HI> &s;hall abu&s;e, in Word or Deed, any <HI>Planter</HI> of this <HI>Province,</HI> that he &s;hall not be his own Judge upon the <HI>Indian</HI>; but he &s;hall make his Complaint to the <HI>Governor</HI> of the <HI>Province,</HI> or his <HI>Lieutenant</HI> or <HI>Deputy,</HI> or &s;ome inferior <HI>Magi&s;trate</HI> near him; who &s;hall, to the utmo&s;t of his Power, take Care, with the KING of the &s;aid <HI>Indian,</HI> that all rea&s;onable Sati&s;|faction be made to the &s;aid injured <HI>Planter.</HI></P>
<P>That all Differences between the <HI>Planters</HI> and the <HI>Natives,</HI> &s;hall al&s;o be ended by <HI>Twelve Men,</HI> that is, by <HI>Six Planters</HI> and <HI>Six Natives,</HI> that &s;o we may live friendly together, as much as in us lieth, preventing all Occa&s;ions of Heart-burnings and Mi&s;chief.</P></Q>
<P>A Conduct regulated by &s;uch Principles of <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> could not fail to influence this di&s;cerning

People, and bia&s;s them in favour of the <HI>ENGLISH;</HI> a Continuance of the like Conduct mu&s;t attach them in|violably: And the pre&s;ent worthy <HI>Governor</HI> and <HI>Coun|cil</HI> &s;eem &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the Nece&s;&s;ity of cultivating a good Under&s;tanding with the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> as to be likely to omit no Opportunity of <HI>brightening the Chain,</HI> or <HI>increa&s;ing the Fire of Friend&s;hip</HI> with them.</P>
<P>The Confidence which the&s;e Nations repo&s;e in their <HI>Interpreter,</HI> is a Proof of his <HI>Indu&s;try, good Sen&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Addre&s;s:</HI> Nothing could have happened more fa|vourably to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Settlements, than that tho&s;e delicate Affairs &s;hould be in the Hands of a Per&s;on equally ju&s;t, and a Friend to both.</P>
<P>The <HI>FRENCH</HI> are perpetually labouring to <HI>debauch</HI> their Faith to the <HI>ENGLISH:</HI> Their Emi&s;&s;aries, the Prie&s;ts, an indefatigable, artful, in&s;inuating Race, are con&s;tantly labouring to gain Admittance among&s;t them. They a&s;&s;ume all Shapes, try every Spring; they mag|nify the Power and Grandeur of <HI>FRANCE;</HI> they &s;tudy to render the <HI>ENGLISH</HI> diminutive and contemptible; they foment every little Occa&s;ion of Di&s;gu&s;t, and leave no Stone unturned to prejudice us in their E&s;teem.</P>
<P>Hitherto the Honour of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and the experienced good Intentions and Probity of the <HI>ENG|LISH,</HI> have been a &s;ufficient Barrier again&s;t all their Intrigues: But it cannot be imprudent to countermine the intended Mi&s;chief, by giving &s;uitable Encourage|ment to proper Per&s;ons, to conver&s;e with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and &s;tudy their Genius. An open-hearted Genero&s;ity wins them effectually: The Temper of the <HI>ENGLISH</HI> is happily &s;uited to this; and the additional Qualifica|tions of <HI>Integrity</HI> and <HI>Prudence,</HI> mu&s;t in Time pave the Way to an A&s;cendency in their Councils; and by this Means the Subtilty of the <HI>FRENCH</HI> would be utterly defeated.</P>

<P>The Governor &s;poke as follows:</P>
<Q><P><HI>Honourable Gentlemen, Commi&s;&s;ioners for the Governments of</HI> Virginia <HI>and</HI> Maryland, <HI>and BRETHREN, Sachems or Chiefs of the</HI> Indians <HI>of the</HI> Six Nations,</P>
<P>At a Treaty held by me two Years ago, in be|half of the Government of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> with a Number of the Chiefs of the <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> I was de&s;ired by them to write to the Government of <HI>Maryland,</HI> concerning &s;ome Lands in the back Parts of that Province, which they 
<PB N="4" REF="005417_0016_10182C4B78FB8258">
claimed a Right to, from their Conque&s;ts over the antient Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and which have been &s;ettled by &s;ome of the Inhabitants of that Government, without their Con&s;ent, or any Purcha&s;e made from them.</P>
<P>It was at that Time under&s;tood, That the Claim was upon <HI>Maryland</HI> only; but it has &s;ince appeared, by &s;ome Letters formerly wrote by Mr. Pre&s;ident <HI>Logan,</HI> to the late Governor of <HI>Mary|land,</HI> that it related likewi&s;e, to &s;ome Lands in the back Parts of <HI>Virginia.</HI></P>
<P>The Governors of tho&s;e Colonies &s;oon manife&s;t|ed a truly equitable Di&s;po&s;ition, to come to any rea&s;onable Terms with the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> on ac|count of tho&s;e Lands; and de&s;ired, that, for that End, a Time and Place might be fixed for a Treaty with them.</P>
<P>But before this cou'd be effected, an unfortu|nate Skirmi&s;h happened, in the back Parts of <HI>Virginia,</HI> between &s;ome of the Militia there, and a Party of the <HI>Indian</HI> Warriors of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> with &s;ome Lo&s;s on both Sides. Who was the Aggre&s;&s;ors, is not at this Time to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, both Parties having agreed to bury that Affair in Oblivion; and the Government of <HI>Virginia,</HI> hav|ing, in Token of the Continuance of their Friend|&s;hip, pre&s;ented the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> through my Hands, with Goods to the Value of One Hundred Pounds <HI>Sterling,</HI> to prevent further Ho&s;tilities, and to heal this Breach.</P>
<P>I had, before the Pre&s;ent was given, made a Tender of my good Offices, which both Parties accepted, and con&s;ented, on my In&s;tances, to lay down their Arms: Since which, the Faith pledg|ed to me has been mutually pre&s;erved, and a 
<PB N="5" REF="005417_0017_10182C4F1103DD90">
Time and Place has been agreed upon, through my Intervention, for accommodating all Differ|ences, and for &s;ettling a firm Peace, Union, and Friend&s;hip, as well between the Government of <HI>Virginia,</HI> as that of <HI>Maryland,</HI> and the <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Six Nations.</HI></P>
<P>The Honourable the Commi&s;&s;ioners for the&s;e two Governments, and the Deputies of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> are now met at the Place appointed for the Treaty.</P>
<P>It only remains therefore for me to &s;ay, that if my further good Offices &s;hall be thought u&s;eful, for the Accompli&s;hment of this good Work, you may rely mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly upon them.</P>
<P><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The foregoing Paragraph was intended to be &s;poke, but was not.</NOTE> But I hope, Honourable Gentlemen Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, it will not be taken ami&s;s, if I go a little further, and briefly repre&s;ent to you, how e&s;pecially nece&s;&s;ary it is, at this Juncture, for His Maje&s;ty's Service, and the Good of all His Colo|nies, in this Part of His Dominions, that Peace and Friend&s;hip be e&s;tabli&s;hed between your Go|vernments, and the <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Six Nations.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> by their Situation, are a Fron|tier to &s;ome of them; and from thence, if Friends, are capable of defending their Settlements; if E|nemies, of making cruel Ravages upon them; if Neuters, they may deny the <HI>French</HI> a Pa&s;&s;age through their Country, and give us timely Notice of their De&s;igns.</P>
<P>The&s;e are but &s;ome of the Motives for cultiva|ting a good Under&s;tanding with them, but from hence, the Di&s;advantages of a Rupture are abun|dantly
<PB N="6" REF="005417_0018_10182C509CC595D8">
evident. Every Advantage you gain over them in War, will be a Weakening of the Bar|rier of tho&s;e Colonies, and con&s;equently be, in Ef|fect, Victories over your&s;elves, and your Fellow Subjects. Some Allowances for their Prejudices and Pa&s;&s;ions, and a Pre&s;ent now and then, for the Relief of their Nece&s;&s;ities, which have, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, been brought upon them, by their In|tercour&s;e with us, and by our yearly extending our Settlements, will probably tye them more clo&s;ely to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>This has been the Method of <HI>New-York,</HI> and <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and will not put you to &s;o much Expence in Twenty Years, as the carrying on a War again&s;t them will do, in One.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> very well know the Importance of the&s;e Nations to us; and will not fail by Pre|&s;ents, and their other u&s;ual Arts, to take Advan|tage of any Mi&s;under&s;tandings we may have with them.</P>
<P>But I will detain you, Gentlemen, no longer; your own &s;uperior Knowledge will &s;ugge&s;t to you, more than I can &s;ay, on this Subject.</P>
<P><HI>FRIENDS and BRETHREN, Sachems or Chiefs of the</HI> Indians <HI>of the Six Nations,</HI> The&s;e, your Brethren of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Mary|land,</HI> are come to enlarge the Fire which was almo&s;t gone out, and to make it burn clearer, to brighten the Chain which had contracted &s;ome Ru&s;t, and to renew their Friend&s;hip with you; which it is their De&s;ire, may la&s;t &s;o long as the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars &s;hall give Light.</P>
<P>Their Powers are derived from the great King of <HI>England,</HI> your Father, and whatever Conclu|&s;ions 
<PB N="7" REF="005417_0019_10182C52659A1558">
they &s;hall come to with you, will be as firm and binding, as if the Governors of the&s;e Provin|ces were them&s;elves here.</P>
<P>I am your Brother, and, which is more, I am your true Friend: As you know from Experience that I am &s;o, I will now give you a few Words of Advice.</P>
<P>Receive the&s;e your Brethren with open Arms; unite your&s;elves to them in the Covenant Chain, and be you with them as one Body and one S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ul.</P>
<P>I make no Doubt, but the Governor of <HI>Cana|da</HI> has been taking Pains to widen the Breach between the&s;e, your Brethren of <HI>Virginia,</HI> and you; but as you cannot have forget the Hatred the <HI>French</HI> have always born to your Nations, and how kindly on the contrary you have been treated, and how faithfully you have been pro|tected by the great King of <HI>England,</HI> and his Subjects, you will not be at a Lo&s;s to &s;ee into the De&s;igns of that Governor. He wants to divide you from us, the more ea&s;ily to de&s;troy you; which he will mo&s;t certainly do, if you &s;uffer your|&s;elves to be deluded by him.</P>
<P>As to what relates to the Friend&s;hip, e&s;tablith|ed between the Government of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and your Nations, I will take another Day to &s;peak to you upon it.</P></Q>
<P>And to enforce what had been &s;aid, the Gover|nor laid down a Belt of <HI>Wampum</HI>; upon which, the <HI>Indians</HI> gave their u&s;ual Cry of Approbation.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort Pau&s;e, the Governor ordered the Interpreter to tell the <HI>Indians,</HI> That as they had greatly exceeded their appointed Time of meeting 
<PB N="8" REF="005417_0020_10182C584A0239B0">
the Commi&s;&s;ioners, he recommended to them, to u&s;e all the Expedition po&s;&s;ible, in giving their An|&s;wer to what had been &s;aid, that they might forth|with proceed to treat with the re&s;pective Commi&s;|&s;ioners, on the Bu&s;ine&s;s they came about.</P>
<P>Then the Governor addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the Honourable Commi&s;&s;ioners, in the following Man|ner:</P>
<Q><HI>GENTLEMEN, the Honourable the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners of</HI> Virginia <HI>and</HI> Maryland, If, in the future Cour&s;e of this Treaty, my good Offices &s;hall be thought u&s;eful, you may mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly rely upon them.</Q>
<P>For which Speech, all the Commi&s;&s;ioners return'd the Governor their Thanks.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Cana&s;ateego</HI> repeated to the Interpreter, the Sub&s;tance of what the Governor had &s;poke, in order to know if he had under&s;tood him right; a Method always made U&s;e of by the <HI>Indians:</HI> And when the Interpreter told him, he had taken the true Sen&s;e, <HI>Cana&s;ateego</HI> proceeded to re|turn the Thanks of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> for the Gover|nor's kind Advice, promi&s;ing to follow it, as far as lay in their Power; but as it was their Cu&s;tom, when a Belt was given, to return another, they would take Time till the Afternoon, to provide One, and would then give their An&s;wer.</P>

<P>CANASATEEGO's An&s;wer to the Governor's Speech, delivered in the Morning.</P>
<Q><P><HI>BROTHER ONAS,</HI></P>
<P>You &s;poke, in the Pre&s;ence of <HI>A&s;&s;araquoa,</HI> and the Governor of <HI>Maryland,</HI> to us, advi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ng us to receive them as our Brethren, and to unite with them in the Covenant Chain, as one Body, and one Soul. We have always con&s;idered them as our Brethren, and as &s;uch, &s;hall be willing to brighten the Chain of Friend&s;hip with them.</P>
<P>But &s;ince there are &s;ome Di&s;putes between us, re&s;pecting the Lands po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by them, which formerly belonged to us; we, according to our Cu&s;tom, propo&s;e to have tho&s;e Differences fir&s;t adju&s;ted, and then we &s;hall proceed to confirm the Friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between us, which will meet with no Ob&s;truction, after the&s;e Matters are &s;ettled.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="10" REF="005417_0022_10182C5FF7E88000">
Here they pre&s;ented the Governor with a Belt of <HI>Wampum,</HI> in Return for the Belt given them in the Morning, by the Governor.</P>
<P>Then the Governor, in Reply, &s;poke as follows:</P>
<Q>I receive your Belt with great Kindne&s;s and Affection; and as to what relates to the Govern|ments of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland,</HI> the Honourable Commi&s;&s;ioners now pre&s;ent, are ready to treat with you. I &s;hall only add, that the Goods for the Hundred Pounds <HI>Sterling,</HI> put into my Hands by the Governor of <HI>Virginia,</HI> as a Token of his good Di&s;po&s;ition to pre&s;erve Friend&s;hip with you, are now in Town, and ready to be delivered, in Con&s;equence of what was told you by <HI>Conrad Wei&s;er,</HI> when he was la&s;t at <HI>Onondago.</HI></Q>
<P>Then the Governor, turning to the Commi&s;&s;ioners of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland,</HI> &s;aid,</P>
<Q><P><HI>GENTLEMEN,</HI></P>
<P>I have now fini&s;hed what was incumbent upon me to &s;ay, by way of Introduction, to the <HI>Indi|ans</HI>; and as you have full Authority from your re&s;pective Governments, to treat with them, I &s;hall leave the re&s;t entirely to you, and either &s;tay, or withdraw, as you &s;hall think it mo&s;t for your Service.</P></Q>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;aid, they were all of Opinion, it would be for their Advantage to have the Go|vernor to &s;tay with them; and therefore, they una|nimou&s;ly de&s;ired he would favour them with the Continuance of his Pre&s;ence, while they &s;hould be
<PB N="11" REF="005417_0023_10182C6360165B00">
in Treaty with the <HI>Indians:</HI> Which, his Honour &s;aid, he would, at their In&s;tance, very readily do, believing it might expedite their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and pre|vent any Jealou&s;y the <HI>Indians</HI> might conceive, at his withdrawing.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners of <HI>Maryland</HI> ordered the In|terpreter to acquaint the <HI>Indians,</HI> that the Gover|nor of <HI>Maryland</HI> was going to &s;peak to them; and then &s;poke as follows:</P>
<Q><P><HI>FRIENDS and BRETHREN, of the united</HI> Six Nations,</P>
<P>We who are deputed from the Government of <HI>Maryland,</HI> by a Commi&s;&s;ion under the Great Seal of that Province, now in our Hands, and which will be interpreted to you, bid you welcome; and, in Token that we are very glad to &s;ee you here as Brethren, we give you this String of <HI>Wampum.</HI></P></Q>
<P><HI>Here the u&s;ual Cry of Approbation was given,</HI></P>
<Q><P>When the Governor of <HI>Maryland</HI> received the fir&s;t Notice, about Seven Years ago, of your Claim to &s;ome Lands in that Province, he thought our Friends and Brethren of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> had little Rea&s;on to complain of any Injury from <HI>Ma|ryland</HI>; and that they would be &s;o well convinc'd thereof, on further Deliberation, as he &s;hould hear no more of it: But you &s;poke of that Matter again to the Governor of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> about two Years &s;ince, as if you de&s;igned to terrify us.</P>
<P>It was very incon&s;iderately &s;aid by you, <HI>That you would do your&s;elves Ju&s;tice, by going to take Payment your&s;elves.</HI> Such an Attempt would
<PB N="12" REF="005417_0024_10182C656CE6E368">
have intirely di&s;&s;olved the Chain of Friend&s;hip, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting not only between us, but perhaps be|tween the other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and you.</P>
<P>We a&s;&s;ure you, our People, who are numerous, courageous, and have Arms ready in their Hands, will not &s;uffer them&s;elves to be hurt in their Lives and E&s;tates.</P>
<P>But however, the old and wi&s;e People of <HI>Ma|ryland,</HI> immediately met in Council; and upon con&s;idering, very cooly, your ra&s;h Expre&s;&s;ion, a|greed to invite their Brethren, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> to this Place, that they might learn of them, what Right they have to the Land in <HI>Maryland</HI>; and, if they had any, to make them &s;ome rea&s;on|able Compen&s;ation for it.</P>
<P>Therefore, the Governor of <HI>Maryland</HI> has &s;ent us to meet and treat with you, about this Affair, and the brightening and &s;trengthening the Chain, which hath long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between us; and as an Earne&s;t of our Sincerity and good Will towards you, we pre&s;ent you with this Belt of <HI>Wampum.</HI></P></Q>
<P><HI>Here the Cry of Approbation was given.</HI></P>
<Q><P>Our great King of <HI>England,</HI> and his Subjects, have always po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Province of <HI>Maryland,</HI> free and undi&s;turbed from any Claim of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> for above One Hundred Years pa&s;t; and your not &s;aving any Thing to us before, convin|ces us, you thought you had no Pretence to any Lands in <HI>Maryland.</HI> Nor can we yet find out, to what Lands, or under what Title, you make your Claim.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Su&s;quehannah Indians,</HI> by a Treaty a|bove Ninety Years &s;ince, which is on the Table, 
<PB N="13" REF="005417_0025_10182C6A65D735C8">
and will be interpreted to you, <HI>GIVE</HI> and <HI>YIELD,</HI> to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, their Heirs and A&s;&s;igns for ever, the greate&s;t Part, if not all, of the Land we po&s;&s;e&s;s, from <HI>Patuxent</HI> River, on the <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> as well as from <HI>Choptank</HI> River, on the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Side of the great Bay of <HI>Che&s;apeak:</HI> And near Sixty Years ago, you acknowledged to the Governor of <HI>New-York,</HI> at <HI>Albany,</HI> That you had given your Lands, and &s;ubmitted your&s;elves, to the King of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>We are that great King's Subjects, and we po&s;|&s;e&s;s and enjoy the Province of <HI>Maryland,</HI> by Vir|tue of his Right and Sovereignty thereto: Why then will you &s;tir up any Quarrel between you and our&s;elves, who are as one Man, under the Protection of that great King?</P>
<P>We need not put you in Mind of the Treaty, which, we &s;uppo&s;e, you have had from your Fa|thers, made with the Province of <HI>Maryland,</HI> near Seventy Years ago; and renewed and confirmed twice &s;ince that Time.</P>
<P>By the&s;e Treaties, we became Brethren: We have always liv'd as &s;uch, and hope always to continue &s;o.</P>
<P>We have this further to &s;ay, that altho' we are not &s;ati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fied of the Ju&s;tice of your Claim to any Lands in <HI>Maryland</HI>; yet we are de&s;irous of &s;hewing our brotherly Kindne&s;s and Affection, and to prevent, by any rea&s;onable Way, every Mi&s;|under&s;tanding between the Province of <HI>Maryland</HI> and you, our Brethren of the <HI>Six Nations.</HI></P>
<P>For this Purpo&s;e, we have brought with us a Quantity of Goods, for our Brethren the <HI>Six Na|tions,</HI> and which will be delivered you, as &s;oon as we &s;hall have received your An&s;wer, and made 
<PB N="14" REF="005417_0026_10182C6BF57610D0">
&s;o bright and large a Fire, as may burn pure and clear whil&s;t the Sun and Moon &s;hall &s;hine.</P>
<P>We have now freely and openly laid our Bo|&s;oms bare to you; and that you may be the bet|ter confirmed of the Truth of our Hearts, we give you this Belt of <HI>Wampum.</HI></P></Q>
<P><HI>Here the u&s;ual Cry of Approbation was given.</HI></P>
<P>After a little Time, <HI>Cana&s;ateego</HI> &s;poke:</P>
<Q><HI>BROTHER, the Governor of</HI> Maryland, We have heard what you have &s;aid to us; and as you have gone back to old Times, we cannot give you an An&s;wer now; but we &s;hall take what you have &s;aid into Con&s;ideration, and return you an An&s;wer &s;ome Time To-morrow.</Q>
<P>He then &s;at down; and after &s;ome Time, &s;poke again:</P>
<Q><HI>BROTHER, the Governor of</HI> Maryland, If you have made any Enquiry into <HI>Indian</HI> Af|fairs, you well know, that we have always had our Guns, Hatchets, and Kettles mended, when ever we come to &s;ee our Brethren: Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> and the Governor of <HI>New-York,</HI> always do this for us; and we give you this early Notice, that we may not thereby be delayed, being de&s;irous, as well as you, to give all po&s;&s;ible Di&s;patch to the Bu&s;ine&s;s, to be tran&s;acted between us.</Q>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland</HI> &s;aid, &s;ince it was cu&s;tomary, they would give Or|ders to have every Thing belonging to them mended, that &s;hould want it.</P>

<Q><P><HI>BROTHER, the Governor of</HI> Maryland, When you mentioned the Affair of the Land Ye&s;terday, you went back to old Times, and told us, you had been in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Province of <HI>Maryland,</HI> above One Hundred Years; but what is a Hundred Years, in Compari&s;on of the Length of Time &s;ince our Claim began? Since we came out of this Ground? For we mu&s;t tell you, that long before a Hundred Years, our Ance&s;tors came out of this very Ground, and their Children have remained here ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>You came out of the Ground in a Country that lies beyond the Seas; there you may have a ju&s;t Claim, but here you mu&s;t allow us to be your elder Brethren, and the Lands to belong to us long before you knew any Thing of them.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="18" REF="005417_0030_10182C79B906A200">
<Q>It is true, that above One Hundred Years ago the <HI>Dutch</HI> came here in a Ship, and brought with them &s;everal Goods, &s;uch as Auls, Knives, Hat|chets, Guns, and many other Particulars, which they gave us: And when they had taught us how to u&s;e their Things, and we &s;aw what Sort of People they were, we were &s;o well plea&s;ed with them, that we tied their Ship to the Bu&s;hes on the Shore; and afterwards, liking them &s;till bet|ter the longer they &s;taid with us, and thinking the Bu&s;hes too &s;lender, we removed the Rope and tied it to the Trees; and as the Trees were liable to be blown down by high Winds, or to decay of them&s;elves, from the Affection we bore them, a|gain removed the Rope, and tied it to a &s;trong and big Rock:</Q> <HI>Here, the Interpreter &s;aid, they mean the</HI> Oncido <HI>Country.</HI> <Q>And not content with this, for its further Security, we removed the Rope to the big Mountain,</Q> <HI>Here, the Interpreter &s;ays, they mean the</HI> Onondago <HI>Country.</HI> <Q>and there we tied it very fa&s;t, and rolled <HI>Wampum</HI> about it; and to make it &s;till more &s;ecure, we &s;tood upon the <HI>Wampum,</HI> and &s;at down upon it, to defend it, and to prevent any Hurt coming to it, and did our be&s;t Endeavours, that it might remain unin|jur'd for ever.</Q></P>
<Q><P>During all this Time, the New-comers the <HI>Dutch,</HI> acknowledged our Right to the Lands, and &s;ollicited us from time to time, to grant them part of our Country, to enter into League and Covenant with us, and to become one People with us.</P>
<P>After this, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> came into the Country, and as we were told, became one People with the <HI>Dutch:</HI> About two Years after the Arrival of
<PB N="19" REF="005417_0031_10182C7B7A55CEB0">
the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Governor came to <HI>Albany</HI>; and finding what great Friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween us and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> he approv'd it mightily, and de&s;ired to make as &s;trong a League, and to be upon as good Terms with us, as the <HI>Dutch</HI> were, with whom he was united, and to become one People with us; and by his further Care in looking into what had pa&s;s'd between us, he found, That the Rope which tied the Ship to the great Mountain, was only &s;a&s;t'ned with <HI>Wampum,</HI> which was liable to break and rot, and to peri&s;h in a Cour&s;e of Years: He therefore told us, that he would give us a Silver Chain, which wou'd be much &s;tronger, and wou'd la&s;t for ever: This we accepted, and &s;aft'ncd the Ship with it, and it has la&s;ted ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>Indeed, we have had &s;ome &s;mall Differences with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and during the&s;e Mi&s;under&s;tand|ings, &s;ome of their young Men wou'd, by way of Reproach, be every now and then telling us, that we &s;hou'd have peri&s;hed, if they had not come into the Country, and furni&s;hed us with Strowds, Hatchets, Guns, and other Things nece&s;&s;ary for the Support of Life: But we always gave them to under&s;tand, that they were mi&s;taken; that we liv'd before they came among&s;t us, and as well or better, if we may believe what our Fore-fathers have told us: We had then Room enough, and Plenty of Deer, which was ea&s;ily caught; and tho' we had not Knives and Hatchets, and Deer, &s;uch as we have now, yet we had Knives of Stone, and Hatchets of Stone, and Bows and Arrows, and the&s;e &s;erv'd our U&s;es, as well then, as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ones do now: We are now &s;traightned, and &s;ometimes in want of Deer, and liable to

many more Inconveniences, &s;ince the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> came among us, and particularly from that Pen and Ink Work, that is going on at the Table; and we will give you an In&s;tance of this.</P>
<P>Our Brother <HI>ONAS,</HI> a great while ago came to <HI>Albany,</HI> to buy the <HI>Su&s;quehannah</HI> Lands of us; but our Brother the Governor of <HI>New-York,</HI> who, as we &s;uppo&s;e, had not a good Under&s;tanding with our Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> advi&s;ed us not to &s;ell him any Land, for he wou'd make an ill U&s;e of it; and pretending to be our good Friend, he advi&s;ed us, in order to prevent <HI>Onas,</HI> or any other Per|&s;ons impo&s;ing upon us, and that we might always have our Land when we &s;hou'd want it to put it into his Hands; and told us, he wou'd keep it for our U&s;e, and never open his Hands, but keep them clo&s;e &s;hut, and not part with any of it, but at our Reque&s;t.</P>
<P>Accordingly, we tru&s;ted him, and put our Land into his Hands, and charged him to keep it &s;a&s;e for our U&s;e: But &s;ome Time after, he went away to <HI>England,</HI> and carried our Land with him, and there &s;old it to our Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> for a large Sum of Money; and when, at the In&s;tance of our Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> we were minded to &s;ell him &s;ome Land, he told us, we had &s;old the <HI>Su&s;quehannah</HI> Lands already, to the Governor of <HI>New-York,</HI> and he had bought them from him in <HI>England</HI>; tho' when he came to under&s;tand, how the Go|vernor of <HI>New-York</HI> had deceived us, he very generon&s;ly paid us for our Lands over again.</P>
<P>Tho' we mention this In&s;tance of an Impo&s;i|tion put upon us, by the Governor of <HI>New-York,</HI> yet we mu&s;t do the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> the Ju&s;tice to &s;ay, We have had their hearty A&s;&s;i&s;tance, in our Wars

<Q><P><HI>BROTHER A&s;&s;araquoa,</HI></P>
<P>Since you have join'd with the Governor of <HI>Maryland,</HI> and Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> in kindling this Fire, we gladly acknowledge the Plea&s;ure we have, in feeing you here, and ob&s;erving your good Di&s;po&s;itions, as well to confirm the Treaties of Friend&s;hip, as to enter into further Contracts about Land, with us: And in Token of our Satisfaction, we pre&s;ent you with this String of <HI>Wampum.</HI></P></Q>
<P><HI>Which was received with the u&s;ual Ceremony.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>BROTHER A&s;&s;araquoa,</HI></P>
<P>In your Speech this Morning, you were plea|&s;ed to &s;ay, We had wrote a Letter to <HI>James Lo|gan,</HI> about Eight Years ago, to demand a Con&s;i|deration for our Lands, in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome of the <HI>Virginians</HI>; that you held them, under 
<PB N="26" REF="005417_0038_10182C9316197C68">
the great King, for upwards of One Hundred and Sixty Years, and that we had already given up our Right; and that therefore, you had de&s;ired the Governor of <HI>New-York</HI> to &s;end his Interpreter to us la&s;t Year, to <HI>Onondago,</HI> which he did; and, as you &s;ay, we, in Council at <HI>Onondago,</HI> did de|clare, <HI>That we had no Demand on you for Lands; and that if we had any Preten&s;ions, we &s;hould have made them known to the Governor of</HI> New-York.</P>
<P>And likewi&s;e, you de&s;ire to know if we have any Right to the <HI>Virginia</HI> Lands; and that we will make &s;uch a Right appear, and tell you what Nation of <HI>Indians</HI> we conquered tho&s;e Lands from.</P>
<P>Now we an&s;wer.</P>
<P>We have the Right of Conque&s;t, a Right too dearly purcha&s;ed, and which co&s;t us too much Blood, to give up, without any Rea&s;on at all, as you &s;ay we have done, at <HI>Albany.</HI> But we &s;hou'd be oblig'd to you, if you would let us &s;ee that Letter, and inform us, who was the Interpreter, and who&s;e Names are put to the Letter; for as the whole Tran&s;action can't be above a Year's Standing, it mu&s;t be fre&s;h in every Bodies Memo|ty, and &s;ome of our Council would ea&s;ily remem|ber it.</P>
<P>But we a&s;&s;ure you, and are well able to prove, that neither we, nor any Part of us, have ever relinqui&s;hed our Right; or ever gave &s;uch an An|&s;wer, as you &s;ay is mentioned in your Letter.</P>
<P>Cou'd we, &s;o many Years ago, make a formal Demand by <HI>James Logan,</HI> and not be &s;en&s;ible of our Right? And hath any Thing happened &s;ince that Time, to make us le&s;s &s;en&s;ible? No: And 
<PB N="27" REF="005417_0039_10182C96C4535C60">
as this Matter can be ea&s;ily cleared up, we are anxious it &s;hou'd be done; for we are po&s;itive, no &s;uch Thing was ever mentioned to us at <HI>Onondago,</HI> nor any where el&s;e.</P>
<P>All the World knows, we conquered the &s;eve|ral Nations living on <HI>Su&s;quehanna, Cohongaronta,</HI> and on the Back of the great Mountains in <HI>Virgi|nia:</HI> The <HI>Conoy-uch-&s;ugh-roonoa, Coch-naw-wa&s;|roonaw, Tohod-irough-roonow,</HI> and <HI>Canut&s;-hin|ough-roonaw,</HI> feel the Effects of our Conque&s;t, be|ing now a Part of our Nations, and their Land at our Di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>We know very well, it hath often been &s;aid, by the <HI>Virginians,</HI> That the great King of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and the People of that Colony, conquered the <HI>Indians</HI> who lived there; but it is not true: We will allow, they have conquered the <HI>Sachdag|ugh-roonaw,</HI> and drove back the <HI>Tu&s;caroras</HI>; and that they have, on that Account, a Right to &s;ome Part of <HI>Virginia:</HI> But as to what lies beyond the Mountains, we conquered the Nations re&s;iding there; and that Land, if ever the <HI>Virginians</HI> get a good Right to it, it mu&s;t be by us. And in Te&s;timony of the Truth of our An&s;wer to this Part of our Speech, we give you this String of <HI>Wampum.</HI></P></Q>

<Q><P><HI>BROTHER A&s;&s;araquoa,</HI></P>
<P>We have given you a full An&s;wer to the fir&s;t Part of your Speech, which we hope will be &s;ati&s;|factory: We are glad to hear you have brought with you a big Che&s;t of new Goods, and that you have the Key in your Pockets. We do not doubt but we &s;hall have a good Under&s;tanding in all

Points, and come to an Agreement with you. We &s;hall open all our Hearts to you, that you may know every Thing in them; we will hide nothing from you. And we hope, that if there be any Thing &s;till remaining in your Brea&s;t, that may occa&s;ion any Di&s;pute between us, you will take this Opportunity to unbo&s;om your Hearts, and lay them open to us; that henceforth, there may be no Dirt or any other Ob&s;tacle in the Road between us.

You may remember, that about Twenty Years ago, you had a Treaty with us at <HI>Albany,</HI> when you took a Belt of <HI>Wampum</HI> and made a Fence with it on the Middle of the Hill, and told us, that if any of the Warriors of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> came on your Side of the Middle of the Hill, you would hang them; and you gave us Liberty to do the &s;ame with any of your Peo|ple, who &s;hould be found on our Side of the Middle of the Hill: This is the Hill we mean; and we de&s;ire that Treaty may now be confirm'd.</P>
<P>After we left <HI>Albany,</HI> we brought our Road a great deal more to the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> that we might comply with your Propo&s;al; but tho' it was of your own making, your People never ob&s;erv'd it, but came and lived on our Side of the Hill; which we don't blame you for, as you live at a great 
<PB N="29" REF="005417_0041_10182C9D89F44B48">
Di&s;tance, near the Seas, and can't be thought to know what your People do in the back Parts: And on their &s;ettling, contrary to your own Pro|po&s;al, on our new Road, it fell out, that our War|riors did &s;ome Hurt to your Peoples Ca&s;tle; of which a Complaint was made, and tran&s;mitted to us by our Brother <HI>Onas</HI>; and we, at his Reque&s;t, altered the Road again, and brought it to the Foot of the great Mountains, where it now is: And it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to remove it any further to the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> tho&s;e Parts of the Country being ab|&s;olutely impa&s;&s;able, by either Man or Bea&s;t.</P>
<P>We had not been long in the U&s;e of this new Road, before your People came like Flocks of Birds, and &s;at down on both Sides of it; and yet we never made a Complaint to you, tho' you mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, the&s;e Things mu&s;t have been done, by your People, in manife&s;t Breach of your own Propo&s;al, made at <HI>Albany.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore, as we are now opening our Hearts to you, we cannot avoid complaining, and de&s;ire all the&s;e Affairs may be &s;ettled: And that you may be the &s;tronger induc'd to do us Ju&s;tice for what is pa&s;t, and to come to a thorough Set|tlement for the future, we, in the Pre&s;ence of the Governor of <HI>Maryland,</HI> and Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> pre&s;ent you with this Belt of <HI>Wampum.</HI></P></Q>
<P><HI>Which was received with the u&s;ual Ceremony.</HI></P>
<P>Then <HI>Tachanoontia</HI> added, <Q>He forgot to &s;ay, that the Affair of the Road mu&s;t be look'd upon, as a Preliminary to be &s;ettled before the Grant of Lands; and that either the <HI>Virginia</HI> People mu&s;t be oblig'd to remove more Ea&s;terly, or if they are
<PB N="30" REF="005417_0042_10182CA582CEAC78">
permitted to &s;tay, that our Warriors, marching that Way to the Southward, &s;hall go Sharers with them in what they plant.</Q></P>

<P>The Governor &s;poke as follows:</P>
<Q><P><HI>FRIENDS and BRETHREN, of the</HI> Six Nations,</P>
<P>I am always &s;orry, when any Thing happens, that may give you or us the lea&s;t Unea&s;ine&s;s; but as we are mutually engag'd, to keep the Road between us clear and open, and to remove every Ob&s;truction that may lye in the Way: I mu&s;t in|form you, That three of the <HI>Delaware Indians,</HI> lately murdered <HI>John Arm&s;trong</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Trader, and his two Men, in a mo&s;t barbarous Manner, as he was traveling to <HI>Alligany,</HI> and &s;tole his Goods of a con&s;iderable Value.</P>
<P><HI>Shikalamy,</HI> and the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;ettled at <HI>Shomockin,</HI> did well, they &s;eized two of the Murders, and
<PB N="31" REF="005417_0043_10182CA7EB4BA228">
&s;ent them down to our Settlements; but the <HI>In|dians,</HI> who had the Charge of them, afterwards &s;uffered one of them to e&s;cape, on a Pretence, that he was not concern'd in the bloody Deed; the other is now in <HI>Philadelphia</HI> Goal.</P>
<P>By our Law, all the Acce&s;&s;aries to a Murder, are to be tried and put to Death, as well as the Per&s;on that gave the deadly Wound; if they con|&s;ented to it, encouraged it, or any otherwi&s;e a&s;|&s;i&s;ted in it, they are to be put to Death; and it is ju&s;t, it &s;hou'd be &s;o.</P>
<P>If upon Trial, the Per&s;ons pre&s;ent at the Mur|der, are found not to have done any of the&s;e Things, they are &s;et at Liberty.</P>
<P>Two of our People were, not many Years ago, publickly put to Death, for killing two <HI>Indians.</HI> We therefore expect, you will take the mo&s;t ef|fectual Mea&s;ures, to &s;eize, and deliver up to us, the other two <HI>Indians,</HI> pre&s;ent at the&s;e Murders, to be tried with the Principal now in Cu&s;tody. If it &s;hall appear, upon their Trial, that they were not advi&s;ing, or any ways a&s;&s;i&s;ting in this horrid Fact, they will be acquitted and &s;ent home to their Towns: And that you may be &s;atisfied, no In|ju&s;tice will be done to them, I do now invite you, to depute Three or more <HI>Indians,</HI> to be pre&s;ent at their Trials.</P>
<P>I do likewi&s;e expect, that you will order &s;trict Search to be made, for the Remainder of the &s;tolen Goods, that they may be re&s;tor'd to the Wife and Children of the deceas'd.</P>
<P>That what I have &s;aid, may have it's due Weight with you, I give you this String of <HI>Wampum.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Which was received with the u&s;ual Cry of Approbation.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="005417_0044_10182CAA9F1D0EB0">
The Governor ordered the Interpreter to tell them, He expected a very full An&s;wer from them, and that they might take their own Time to give it, for he did not de&s;ire to interfere with the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s of <HI>Virginia</HI> or <HI>Maryland.</HI></P>

<Q><P><HI>Our good FRIENDS and BRETHREN the Six united</HI> Nations,</P>
<P>We have con&s;idered what you &s;aid, concerning your Title to &s;ome Lands now in our Province,
<PB N="33" REF="005417_0045_10182CADEA3655E0">
and al&s;o of the Place where they lye: Although we cannot admit your Right, yet we are &s;o re&s;olved to live, in brotherly Love and Affection with the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> that upon your giving us a Relea&s;e in Writing, of all your Claim to any Lands in <HI>Maryland,</HI> we &s;hall make you a Compen&s;ation, to the Value of Three hundred Pounds Current; for the Payment of part whereof, we have brought &s;ome Goods, and &s;hall make up the re&s;t, in what Manner you think fit.</P>
<P>As we intend to &s;ay &s;omething to you, about our Chain of Friend&s;hip, after this Affair of the Land is &s;ettled: We de&s;ire you will now examine the Goods, and make an End of this Matter.</P>
<P>We will not omit acquainting our good Friends the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> That not with&s;tanding we are likely to come to an Agreement, about your Claim of Lands; yet your Brethren of <HI>Maryland,</HI> look on you to be as one Soul and one Body with them&s;elves: And as a broad Road will be made between us, we &s;hall always be de&s;irous of keep|ing it clear, that we may from time to time take Care, that the Links of our Friend&s;hip be not ru&s;ted. In Te&s;timony, that our Words and Hearts agree, we give you this Belt of <HI>Wampum.</HI></P></Q>
<P><HI>On pre&s;enting of which, the</HI> Indians <HI>made the u&s;ual Cry of Approbation.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wei&s;er</HI> acquainted the <HI>Indians,</HI> That they might now look over the &s;everal Goods, plac'd on a Table in the Chamber, for that Purpo&s;e: And the Honourable Commi&s;&s;ioners bid him tell them, if they diflik'd any of the Goods, or if they were

damaged, the Commi&s;&s;ioners would put a le&s;s Price on &s;uch, that were either di&s;lik'd or damnified.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> having view'd and examined the Goods, and &s;eeming di&s;&s;atisfied at the Price and Worth of &s;ome of them; requir'd Time to go down into the Court-Hou&s;e, in order for a Con&s;ultation to be had by the Chiefs of them, concerning the &s;aid Goods, and likewi&s;e, that the Interpreter might retire with them, which he did; accordingly they went down into the Court-Hou&s;e, and &s;oon after returned again into the Chamber.</P>

<P><HI>SACHEMS and Warriours of the</HI> Six Nations,</P>
<P>We are now come to an&s;wer what you &s;aid to us Ye&s;terday, &s;ince what we &s;aid to you before, on the Part of the great King our Father, has not been &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>You have gone into old Times, and &s;o mu&s;t we: It is true, that the great King holds <HI>Vir|ginia</HI> by Right of Conque&s;t, and the Bounds of that Conque&s;t to the We&s;tward, is the great Sea.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Six Nations</HI> have made any Conque&s;t over <HI>Indians,</HI> that may, at any Time have liv'd, on the We&s;t Side of the great Mountains of <HI>Vir|ginia</HI>; yet they never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any Lands there, that we have ever heard: That Part was altoge|ther de&s;erted, and free for any People to enter upon, as the People of <HI>Virginia</HI> have done, by order of the great King, very ju&s;tly, as well by an antient Right, as by it's being freed from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any other; and from any Claim, even of you the <HI>Six Nations</HI> our Brethren, until within the&s;e eight Years.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Treaty between the great King, in behalf of his Subjects of <HI>Virginia,</HI> and you, that we can find, was made at <HI>Albany,</HI> by Colonel <HI>Henry Cour&s;ey,</HI> &s;eventy Years &s;ince; this was a Treaty of Friend&s;hip, when the fir&s;t Covenant Chain was made, when we and you became Bre|thren.</P>
<P>The next Treaty was al&s;o at <HI>Albany,</HI> about Fifty eight Years ago, by the Lord <HI>Howard</HI> Governor of <HI>Virginia</HI>; then you declare your|&s;elves Subjects to the great King our Father; and gave up to him all your Lands, for his Pro|tection.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="005417_0049_10182CBDA29B4C78">
This you own in a Treaty, made by the Go|vernor of <HI>New-York</HI> with you, at the &s;ame Place, in the Year 1687, and you expre&s;s your&s;elves in the&s;e Words:</P>
<P><HI>O Brethren, you tell us, the King of <HI>England</HI> is a very great King; and why &s;hou'd you not join with us in a ju&s;t Gau&s;e, when the</HI> French <HI>join with our Enemies in an unju&s;t Cau&s;e? O Brethren, we &s;ee the Rea&s;on of this: For the</HI> French <HI>would kill us all, and when that is done, they wou'd carry all the Beaver Trade to</HI> Canada; <HI>and the great King of</HI> England <HI>wou'd lo&s;e the Land likewi&s;e: And therefore, O GREAT SACHEM beyond the great Lakes, awake, and &s;uffer not tho&s;e poor</HI> Indi|ans <HI>that have given them&s;elves, and their Lands, under your Protection, to be de&s;troyed by the</HI> French <HI>without a Cau&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The la&s;t Treaty we &s;hall &s;peak to you about, is that made at <HI>Albany</HI> by Governor <HI>Spot&s;wood,</HI> which you have not recited as it is; for the white People, your Brethren, of <HI>Virginia,</HI> are in no Ar|ticle of that Treaty, prohibited to pa&s;s and &s;ettle to the <HI>We&s;tward</HI> of the great Mountains: It is the <HI>Indians,</HI> tributary to <HI>Virginia,</HI> that are re|&s;trained, as you, and your tributary <HI>Indians</HI> are, from pa&s;&s;ing to the <HI>Ea&s;tward</HI> of the &s;ame Moun|tains, or to the <HI>Southward</HI> of <HI>Cohongoronta</HI>; and you agree to this Article in the&s;e Words:</P>
<P><HI>That the great River</HI> Potomack, <HI>and the high Ridge of Mountains, which extend all along the Frontiers of</HI> Virginia, <HI>to the</HI> We&s;tward <HI>of the pre|&s;ent Settlements of that Colony, &s;hall be, for ever, the e&s;tabli&s;hed Boundaries between the</HI> Indians, <HI>&s;ub|ject to the Dominion of</HI> Virginia, <HI>and the</HI> Indians <HI>belonging to, and depending on the</HI> Five Nations: 
<PB N="38" REF="005417_0050_10182CBF3074E840">
<HI>So that neither our</HI> Indians <HI>&s;hall not, on any Pre|tence what&s;oever, pa&s;s to the</HI> Northward <HI>or</HI> We&s;t|ward <HI>of the &s;aid Boundaries, without having to produce a Pa&s;port, under the Hand and Seal of the Governor or Commander in Chief of</HI> Virginia; <HI>nor your</HI> Indians <HI>pa&s;s to the</HI> Southward <HI>or</HI> Eaftward <HI>of the &s;aid Boundaries, without a Pa&s;port in like Man|ner, from the Governor or Commander in Chief of</HI> New-York.</P>
<P>And what Right can you have to Lands that you have no Right to walk upon, but on certain Conditions? It is true, you have not ob&s;erved this Part of the Treaty, and your Brethren of <HI>Virgi|nia</HI> have not in&s;i&s;ted on it with a due Strictne&s;s; which have occa&s;ioned &s;ome Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>This Treaty has been &s;ent to the Governor of <HI>Virginia,</HI> by Order of the great King, and is what we mu&s;t rely on; and being in Writing, is more certain than your Memory: That is the Way the white People have, of pre&s;erving Tran&s;|actions of every Kind, and tran&s;mitting them down to their Childrens Children for ever; and all Di&s;|putes among them are &s;ettled by this faithful kind of Evidence, and mu&s;t be the Rule between the great King and you.</P>
<P>This Treaty your Sachems and Warriors &s;ign'd: Some Years after the &s;ame, Governor <HI>Spot&s;wood,</HI> in the Right of the great King, had been, with &s;ome of the People of <HI>Virginia,</HI> in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e very Lands, which you have &s;et up your late Claim to</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs at <HI>Albany,</HI> gave the Account we mentioned to you Ye&s;ter|day, to the Governor of <HI>New-York,</HI> and he &s;ent it to the Governor of <HI>Virginia</HI>; their Names will be given you by the Interpreter.</P>

<HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P>This Di&s;pute is not between <HI>Virginia</HI> and you; it is &s;itting up your Right again&s;t the great King, under who&s;e Grants the People you complain of are &s;ettled: Nothing but a Command from the great King can remove them: They are too pow|erful to be removed by any Force of you, our Bre|thren; and the great King, as our common Fa|ther, will do equal Ju&s;tice to all his Children: Wherefore we do believe, that they will be con|firm'd in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>As to the Road you mention, we intended to prevent any Occa&s;ion for it, by making a Peace between you and the <HI>Southern Indians,</HI> a few Years &s;ince, at a con&s;iderable Expence to our great King; which you confirmed at <HI>Albany:</HI> It &s;eems, by your being at War with the <HI>Catawbas,</HI> that it has not been long kept between you.</P>
<P>However, if you de&s;ire a Road, we will agree to one, on the Terms of the Treaty you made with Colonel <HI>Spot&s;wood</HI>; and your People, be|having them&s;elves orderly, like Friends and Bre|thren, &s;hall be u&s;ed, in their Pa&s;&s;age thro' <HI>Vir|ginia,</HI> with the &s;ame Kindne&s;s as they are, when they pa&s;s thro' the Lands of your Brother <HI>Onas.</HI></P>
<P>This, we hope, will be agreed to, by you, our Brethren; and we will abide by the Promi&s;e made to you Ye&s;terday.</P>

<Q><P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P>Ye&s;terday you &s;poke to us, concerning the Lands on this Side <HI>Potomack</HI> River; and as we

<P>We are willing to renounce all Right to Lord <HI>Baltimore,</HI> of all tho&s;e Lands lying Two Miles above the uppermo&s;t Fork of '<HI>Potomack,</HI> or <HI>Cohon|goronta</HI> River, near which <HI>Thomas Cri&s;&s;up</HI> has a hunting or trading Cabbin, by a <HI>North</HI> Line, to the Bounds of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania:</HI> But in ca&s;e &s;uch Li|mits &s;hall not include every Settlement or Inhabitant of <HI>Maryland,</HI> then &s;uch other Lands and Cour&s;es, from the &s;aid Two Miles above the Fork, to the outermo&s;t Inhabitants or Settlements as &s;hall include every Settlement and Inhabitant in <HI>Maryland</HI>; and from thence, by a <HI>North</HI> Line to the Bounds of '<HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> &s;hall be the Li|mits.</P>
<P>And further, If any People already have, or &s;hall &s;ettle, beyond the Lands now de&s;cribed and bounded, they &s;hall enjoy the &s;ame, free from any Di&s;turbance of us, in any Manner whatever; and we do, and &s;hall accept tho&s;e People, for our Brethren, and as &s;uch, always treat them.</P>

<Q><P><HI>BROTHER A&s;&s;araquoa,</HI></P>
<P>The World at the fir&s;t, was made on the other Side the great Water, different from what it is on this Side, as may be known from the different Colours of our Skin, and of our Fle&s;h; and that which you call Ju&s;tice, may not be &s;o among&s;t us: You have your Laws and your Cu&s;toms, and &s;o have we: The great King might &s;end you over to conquer the <HI>Indians,</HI> but it looks to us, that God did not approve of it; if he had, he would not have placed the Sea where it is, as the Limits between us and you.</P>
<P><HI>BROTHER A&s;&s;araquoa,</HI></P>
<P>Tho' great Things are well remembered among us, yet we don't remember that we were ever conquered by the great King; or that we have 
<PB N="43" REF="005417_0055_10182CD1C1A927D8">
been employed by that great King to conquer others: If it was &s;o, it is beyond our Memory. We do remember we were employed by <HI>Maryland,</HI> to conquer the <HI>Cono&s;togas</HI>; and that the Second Time we was at War with them, we carried them all off.</P>
<P><HI>BROTHER A&s;&s;araquoa,</HI></P>
<P>You charge us with not acting agreeable to our Peace with the <HI>Catawbas</HI>; we will repeat truly to you what was done. The Governor of <HI>New|York,</HI> at <HI>Albany,</HI> in Behalf of <HI>A&s;&s;araquoa,</HI> gave us &s;everal Belts from the <HI>Cherrokees</HI> and <HI>Cataw|bas</HI>; and we agreed to a Peace, it tho&s;e Nations would &s;end &s;ome of the great Men to us, to con|firm it Face to Face; and that they wou'd trade with us; and de&s;ired, that they would appoint a Time to meet at <HI>Albany,</HI> for this Purpo&s;e: But they never came.</P>
<P><HI>BROTHER A&s;&s;araquoa,</HI></P>
<P>We then de&s;ired a Letter might be &s;ent to the <HI>Catawbas</HI> and <HI>Cherrokees,</HI> to de&s;ire them to come and confirm the Peace: It was long before an An&s;wer came; but we met the <HI>Cherrokees</HI> and con|firm'd the Peace, and &s;ent &s;ome of our People to take Care of them, until they returned to their own Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>Catawbas</HI> refus'd to come, and &s;ent us Word that we were but Women; that they were Men, and double Men, for they had Two
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is a Figure by which the <HI>Indians</HI> expre&s;s Strength and Power. So when the Governor of <HI>Canada</HI> de&s;igns to explain to the <HI>Indians</HI> the Power and Strength of the grand Monarch, he tells them his <HI>P&mdash;k</HI> is as large as he can &s;pan with both his Hands.</NOTE> <HI>P&mdash;ks</HI>;
<PB N="44" REF="005417_0056_10182CD445FCA760">
that they could make Women of us, and wou'd be always at War with us. They are a deceitful People; our Brother <HI>A&s;&s;araquoa</HI> is deceived by them; we don't blame him for it, but are &s;orry he is deceived.</P>
<P><HI>BROTHER A&s;&s;araquoa,</HI></P>
<P>We have confirm'd the Peace with the <HI>Cherro|kees,</HI> but not with the <HI>Catawbas</HI>; they have been treacherous, and know it, &s;o that the War mu&s;t continue till one of us is de&s;troyed: This we think proper to tell you, that you may not be troubled at what we do to the <HI>Catawbas.</HI></P>
<P><HI>BROTHER A&s;&s;araquoa,</HI></P>
<P>We will now &s;peak to the Point between us: You &s;ay you will agree with us as to the Road; we de&s;ire that may be the Road which was la&s;t made the Waggon Road. It is always a Cu&s;tom, among Brethren or Strangers, to u&s;e each other kindly: You have &s;ome very ill-natur'd People living up there; &s;o that we de&s;ire the Per&s;ons in Power may know, that we are to have rea&s;on|able Victuals when we are in Want.</P>
<P>You know very well when the white People came fir&s;t here, they were poor; but now they have got our Lands, they are become rich, and we are now poor: What little we have had for the Land goes &s;oon away, but the Land la&s;ts for ever. You told us you had brought with you a Che&s;t of Goods, and that you have the Key in your Pockets; but we have never &s;een the Che&s;t, nor the Goods that are &s;aid to be in it; it may be &s;mall, and the Goods few; we want to &s;ee them, and are as de&s;irous to come to &s;ome Conclu&s;ion as 
<PB N="45" REF="005417_0057_10182CD6E83B0AB0">
you are: We have been &s;leeping here the&s;e Ten Days pa&s;t, and have not done any Thing to the Purpo&s;e.</P></Q>
<P>The Honourable Commi&s;&s;ioners told them, they &s;hou'd &s;ee the Goods on <HI>Monday,</HI> and ordered &s;ome Punch, &s;ufficient for the Number of <HI>Indians</HI> then pre&s;ent.</P>

<P>The other Day, you was pleas'd to tell us, you was always concern'd, when ever any thing hap|pened, that might give you or us Unea&s;ine&s;s, and that we were mutually engag'd, to pre&s;erve the Road open and clear between us; and you in|form'd us, of the Murder of <HI>John Arm&s;trong</HI> and his two Men. by &s;ome of the <HI>Delaware Indians,</HI> and of their &s;tealing his Goods to a con&s;iderable Value: The <HI>Delaware Indians,</HI> as you &s;uppo&s;e, are under our Power.

<P><HI>Which was received with the u&s;ual Ceremony.</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="50" REF="005417_0062_10182CE80FED6480">
<P><HI>BROTHER ONAS,</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Things happen frequently, and we de|&s;ire you will con&s;ider them well, and not be too much concerned. Three <HI>Indians</HI> have been kill'd at different Times at <HI>Tohio,</HI> and we never men|tioned any of them to you, imagining it might have been occa&s;ioned by &s;ome unfortunate Quar|rels, and were unwilling to create a Di&s;turbance: We therefore de&s;ire you will con&s;ider the&s;e Things well; and to take the Grief out of your Heart, we give you this String of <HI>Wampum.</HI></P></Q>
<P><HI>Which was received with the u&s;ual Ceremony.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>BROTHER ONAS,</HI></P>
<P>We had heard of the Murder of <HI>John Arm|&s;trong,</HI> and in our Journey hither, we had a Con|ference with our Cou&s;ins the <HI>Delawares</HI> about it, and reprov'd them &s;everely for it; and charg'd them to go down to our Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> and make him Satisfaction, both for the Men that were kill'd, and for the Goods.</P>
<P>We under&s;tood by them, that the principal Actor in the&s;e Murders, is in your Pri&s;on, and that he had done all the Mi&s;chief him&s;elf; but be&s;ides him, you had accus'd and demanded two others, who were in his Company, when the Murder was committed.</P>
<P>We promi&s;e faithfully, in our Return, to renew our Reproofs, and to charge the <HI>Delaware</HI>'s to &s;end down &s;ome of their Chiefs, with the&s;e two young Men, but not as Pri&s;oners, to be examined by you; and as we think, upon Examination, you will not find them guilty, we rely on your Ju&s;tice, not to do them any Harm, but to permit them to return home in Safety: We likewi&s;e un|der&s;tand,
<PB N="51" REF="005417_0063_10182CE9A05A8438">
that Search has been made for the Goods, belonging to the deceas'd, and that &s;ome have been already return'd to your People, but that &s;ome are &s;till mi&s;&s;ing: You may depend upon our giving the &s;tricte&s;t Charge to the <HI>Delaware</HI>'s, to &s;earch again with more Diligence, for the Goods, and to return them, or the Value of them in Skins: And to confirm what we &s;ay, we give you this String of <HI>Wampum.</HI></P></Q>
<P><HI>Which was received with the u&s;ual Ceremony.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>BROTHER ONAS,</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Canoy Indians</HI> have inform'd us, that they &s;ent you a Me&s;&s;age &s;ome Time ago, to advi&s;e you, that being ill u&s;ed by the white People, in the Place where they have their Land, and that they had come to a Re&s;olution of removing to <HI>Shomcc|kin,</HI> and reque&s;ted &s;ome &s;mall Satisfaction for their Lands: And as they never have received any An&s;wer from you, they have de&s;ired us to &s;peak for them: We heartily recommend their Ca&s;e to your Genero&s;ity; and to give Weight to our Re|commendation, we pre&s;ent you with this String of <HI>Wampum.</HI></P></Q>
<P><HI>Which was received with the u&s;ual Ceremony.</HI></P>
<P>The Governor having confer'd with the Honour|able Commi&s;&s;ioners of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland,</HI> made the following Reply:</P>
<Q><P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P>I am glad to find, that you agree with me, in the Nece&s;&s;ity of keeping the Road between us, clear and open; and the Concern you have ex|pre&s;s'd, on account of the barbarous Murders
<PB N="52" REF="005417_0064_10182CEE8D33A768">
mentioned to you, is a Proof of your brotherly Affection for us.</P>
<P>In Crimes of this Nature, be not &s;trictly in|quir'd into, and the Criminals &s;everely puni&s;hed, there will be an Fnd of all Commerce, between us and the <HI>Indians</HI>; and then you will be alto|gether in the Power of the <HI>French</HI>; they will &s;et what Price they plea&s;e on their Goods, and give you what they think fit for your Skins: So it is for your own Intere&s;t, that our Traders &s;hould be &s;afe in their Per&s;ons and Goods, when they travel to your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P>I con&s;idered this Matter well, before I came from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and I advi&s;ed with the Coun|cil there upon it, as I have done here, with the Honourable the Commi&s;&s;ioners of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland</HI>; I never heard before, of the Murder of three <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Hohio:</HI> Had Complaint been made to me of it, and it had appear'd, to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">en committed, by any of the People under my Government, they &s;hould have been put to Death, as two of them were, &s;ome Years ago, for killing two <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>You are not to take your own Satisfaction, but to apply to me, and I will &s;ee that Ju&s;tice be done you; and &s;hou'd any of the <HI>Indians</HI> rob, or murder, any of our People; I do expect, that you will deliver them up, to be tried and puni&s;hed in the &s;ame Manner, as white People are: This is the Way to pre&s;erve Friend&s;hip between us, and will be for your Benefit, as well as ours.</P>
<P>I am well plea&s;ed with the Steps you have al|ready taken, and the Reproofs you have given, to 
<PB N="45" REF="005417_0065_10182CF325F61420">
your Cou&s;ins the <HI>Delawares</HI>; and I do expect, you will lay your Commands on &s;ome of their Chiefs, to bring down the two young Men that were pre&s;ent at the Murders: If they are not brought down, I &s;hall look upon it as a Proof of their Guilt. If, upon Examination, they &s;hall be found not to have been concerned in the bloody Action, they &s;hall be well u&s;ed and &s;ent home in Safety: I will take it upon my&s;elf, to &s;ee that they have no Inju&s;tice done them.</P>
<P>An Inventory is taken of the Goods already re&s;tor'd, and I expect Satisfaction will be made for &s;uch as cannot be found, in Skins, according to their Promi&s;e</P>
<P>I well remember the coming down of one of the <HI>Canoy</HI> Indians, with a Paper, &s;etting forth, that the <HI>Canoys</HI> had come to a Re&s;olution, to leave the Land re&s;erved for them by the Proprietors; but he made no Complaint to me of ill U&s;age from the white People: The Rea&s;on he gave for their Removal was, that the Settling of the white People all round them, had made Deer &s;carce; and that therefore, they cho&s;e to remove to <HI>Joni|atta,</HI> for the Benefit of Hunting. I ordered what they &s;aid to be entered into the Council-Book: The old Man's Expences were born, and a Blan|ket given him at his Return home.</P>
<P>I have not heard from the Proprietors yet on this Head; but you may be affur'd, from the Fa|vour and Ju&s;tice they have always &s;hewn to the <HI>Indians,</HI> that they will do every Thing that can be rea&s;onably expected of them, in this Ca&s;e.</P></Q>

The&s;e Goods, and Two Hundred Pounds in Gold, which lie now on the Table, we will give you, our Brethren of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> upon Condition, that you immediately make a Deed,

recognizing the King's Right to all the Lands that are, or &s;hall be, by His Maje&s;ty's Appointment, in the Colony of <HI>Virginia.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Road, we agree you &s;hall have one; and the Regulations are in a Paper, which the In|terpreter now has in his Cu&s;tody to &s;hew you: The People of <HI>Virginia</HI> &s;hall perform their Part, if you and your <HI>Indians</HI> perform theirs: We are your Brethren, and will do no Hard&s;hips to you, but, on the contrary, all the Kindne&s;s we can.</P></Q>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> agreed to what was &s;aid; and <HI>Cana|&s;ateego</HI> de&s;ired that they would repre&s;ent their Ca&s;e to the King, in order to have a further Con&s;iderati|on, when the Settlements increa&s;ed much further back: To which the Commi&s;&s;ioners agreed, and promi&s;ed they would make &s;uch a Repre&s;entation faithfully and hone&s;tly; and for their further Secu|rity that they would do &s;o, they would give them a Writing, under their Hands and Seals, for that Purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>The Governor &s;poke as follows:</P>
<Q><P><HI>FRIENDS and BRETHREN of the</HI> Six Nations.</P>
<P>At a Treaty held with many of the Chiefs of your Nations, Two Years ago, the Road between us was made clearer and wider; our Fire was en|larged, and our Friend&s;hip confirm'd, by an Ex|change of Pre&s;ents, and many other mutual good Offices.</P>
<P>We think our&s;elves happy, in having been in|&s;trumental to your Meeting with our Brethren of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland</HI>; and we per&s;uade our|&s;elves that you, on your Parts, will always re|member it, as an In&s;tance of our good Will and Affection for you: This has given us an O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">r|tunity of &s;eeing you &s;ooner than perhaps we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> otherwi&s;e have done; and as we are und<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Obligations by Treaties, we to hear with our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> 
<PB N="54" REF="005417_0070_10182D03D7B317C8">
for you, and you to hear with your Ears for us, we take this Opportunity to inform you of what very nearly concerns us both.</P>
<P>The Great King of <HI>England,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> King, have declared War again&s;t each other: Two Battles have been &s;ought, one by Land and the other by Sea; the Great King of <HI>England</HI> commanded the Land Army in Per&s;on, and gain'd a compleat Victory; Numbers of the <HI>French</HI> were kill'd and taken Pri&s;oners, and the re&s;t were &s;orc'd to pa&s;s a River with Precipitation, to &s;ave their Lives: The Great God covered the King's Head in that Battle, &s;o that he did not receive the lea&s;t Hurt; for which you, as well as we, have Rea|&s;on to be very thankful.</P>
<P>The Engagement at Sea was likewi&s;e to the Advantage of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>: The <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spani|ards</HI> join'd their Ships together, and came out to &s;ight us: The brave <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Admiral burnt one of their large&s;t Ships, and many others were &s;o &s;hatter'd, that they were glad to take the Op|portunity of a very high Wind and a dark Night to run away, and to hide them&s;elves again in their Harbours. Had the Weather prov'd &s;air, he wou'd, in all Probability, have taken or de&s;troy'd them all.</P>
<P>I need not put you in Mind how much <HI>Wil|liam Penn,</HI> and his Sons, have been your Friends, and the Friends of all the <HI>Indians</HI>; you have long and often experienc'd their Friend&s;hip for you: Nor need I repeat to you how kindly you were treated, and what valuable Pre&s;ents were made to you, Two Years ago, by the Governor, the Coun|cil, and the A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI> The Sons of <HI>William Penn</HI> are all now in <HI>England,</HI> and have
<PB N="55" REF="005417_0071_10182D07A497EF68">
left me in their Place, well knowing how much I regard you, and all the <HI>Indians:</HI> As a fre&s;h Proof of this, I have left my Hou&s;e and am come this far to &s;ee you, to renew our Treaties, to brighten the covenant Chain, and to confirm our Friend|&s;hip with you. In Te&s;timony whereof, I pre&s;ent you with this Belt of <HI>Wampum.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Which was received with the u&s;ual Cry of Approbation.</P>
<Q>As your Nations have engaged them&s;elves, by Treaty, to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, your Brethren of <HI>Penn&s;ylva|nia,</HI> in Ca&s;e of a War with the <HI>French,</HI> we do not doubt but you will punctually perform an En|gagement &s;o &s;olemnly entered into. A War is now declar'd, and we expect you will not &s;uffer the <HI>French,</HI> or any of the <HI>Indians</HI> in Alliance with them, to march through your Country to di&s;turb any of our Settlements; and that you will give us the earlie&s;t and be&s;t Intelligence of any De&s;igns that may be formed by them to our Di&s;advantage, as we promi&s;e to do of any that may be to yours. To enforce what I have now &s;aid to you, in the &s;tronge&s;t Manner, I pre&s;ent you with this Belt of <HI>Wampum.</HI></Q>
<P>Which was received with the u&s;ual Ceremony.</P>
<P>After a li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">le Pau&s;e, his Honour the Governor &s;poke again:</P>
<Q><P>FRIENDS and BRETHREN of the Six Nations,</P>
<P>What I have now &s;aid to you, is in Conformi|ty to the Treaties &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the Province of which I am Governor, and your <HI>Nations:</HI> I 
<PB N="56" REF="005417_0072_10182D09B22324E0">
now proceed, with the Con&s;ent of the Honourable Commi&s;&s;ioners of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland,</HI> to tell you That all Differences having been adju&s;ted, and the Road between us and you made quite clear and open, we are ready to confirm our Trea|ties with your <HI>Nations,</HI> and e&s;tabli&s;h a Friend&s;hip that is not to end but with the World it&s;elf: And in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">half of the Province of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> I do, by this fine Belt of <HI>Wampum,</HI> and a Pre&s;ent of Goods, to the Value of Three Hundred Pounds, confirm and e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;aid Treaties of Peace, Union, and Friend&s;hip; you, on your Parts, do|ing the &s;ame.</P></Q>
<P>The Governor further added,</P>
<Q>The Goods bought with the Hundred Pounds <HI>Sterling,</HI> put into my Hands by the Governor of <HI>Vuginia,</HI> are ready to be delivered when you plea&s;e: The Goods bought and &s;ent up by the Peo le of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> according to the Li&s;t which the Interpreter will explain, are laid by them&s;elves, and are likewi&s;e ready to be delivered to you at your own Time.</Q>
<P>After a little Time, the Commi&s;&s;ioners of <HI>Virginia</HI> &s;poke as follows:</P>
<Q><P><HI>SACHEMS and Warriours of the</HI> Six Nations,</P>
<P>The Way between us being made &s;mooth by what pa&s;s'd Ye&s;terday, we de&s;ire now to confirm all former Treaties, made between <HI>Virginia</HI> and you our Brethren of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and to make our Chain of Union and Friend&s;hip as bright as 
<PB N="57" REF="005417_0073_10182D0ECAFF0C58">
the Sun, that it may not contract any more Ru&s;t for ever; that our Childrens Children may rejoyce at, and confirm what we have done: And that you and your Children may not forget it, we give you One Hundred Pounds in Gold, and this Belt of <HI>Wampum</HI></P></Q>
<P><HI>On pre&s;enting of which, the</HI> Indians <HI>gave the u&s;ual Cry of Approbation.</HI></P>
<Q><P>FRIENDS and BRETHREN,</P>
<P>Altho' we have been di&s;appointed in our En|deavours to bring about a Peace between you and the <HI>Catawbas,</HI> yet we de&s;ire to &s;peak to you &s;omething more about them: We believe they have been unfaithful to you, and &s;poke of you with a fooli&s;h Contempt; but this may be only the Ra&s;hne&s;s of &s;ome of their young Men.</P>
<P>In this Time of War, with our common Ene|mies, the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> it will be the wi&s;e&s;t Way, to be at Peace among our&s;elves; they the <HI>Catawbas,</HI> are al&s;o Children of the great King, and therefore we de&s;ire you will agree, that we may endeavour to make a Peace between you and them, that &s;o we may be all united, by one common Chain of Friend&s;hip; therefore we give you this String of <HI>Wampum.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Which was received with the u&s;ual Ceremony.</P>
<Q><P>BRETHREN,</P>
<P>Our Friend <HI>Conrad Wei&s;er,</HI> when he is old, will go into the other World, as our Fathers have done; our Children will then want &s;uch a Friend, to go between them and your Children, to recon|cile any Differences, that may happen to ari&s;e between them, that like him, may have the Ears and Tongues, of our Children and yours.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="005417_0074_10181049368E3B78">
The way to have &s;uch a Friend is, for you to &s;end three or four of your Boys to <HI>Virginia,</HI> where we have a fine Hou&s;e for them to live in, and a Man on purpo&s;e, to teach the Children of you, our Friends, the Religion, Language, and Cu&s;|toms of the white People.</P>
<P>To this Place we kindly invite you to &s;end &s;ome of your Children; and promi&s;e you, that they &s;hall have the &s;ame Care taken of them, and be in&s;tructed in the &s;ame Manner, as our own Chil|dren; and be return'd to you again when you plea&s;e: And to confirm this, we give you this String of <HI>Wampum.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Which was received with the Cry of Appro|bation.</P>
<P>Next &s;poke the Commi&s;&s;ioners of <HI>Maryland:</HI></P>
<Q><P>FRIENDS and BRETHREN, the Chiefs or Sachems of the <HI>Six</HI> united <HI>Nations,</HI> The Governor of <HI>Maryland</HI> invited you hither; we have treated with you as Friends, and agreed with you as Brethren.</P>
<P>As the Treaty now made, concerning the Lands in <HI>Maryland,</HI> will, we hope, prevent effectually, every future Mi&s;under&s;tanding between us, on that Account; we will now bind fa&s;ter the Links of our Chain of Friend&s;hip, by a Renewal of all our former Treaties: And that they may &s;till be the better &s;ecur'd, we &s;hall pre&s;ent you with One Hundred Pounds in Gold.</P>
<P>What we have further to &s;ay to you is, let not our Chain contract any Ru&s;t; when ever you perceive the lea&s;t Speck, tell us of it, and we will make it clean; This we al&s;o expect from you, that it may 
<PB N="59" REF="005417_0075_10182D141C017EA0">
always continue &s;o bright, as our Generations may &s;ee their Faces in it. And in Pledge of the Truth of what we have now &s;poken, and our Affection to you, we give you this Belt of <HI>Wampum.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Which was received with the u&s;ual Cry of Approbation.</P>
<P><HI>Cana&s;ateego,</HI> in Return, &s;poke as follows:</P>
<Q><P>BROTHER Onas, A&s;&s;araquoa, and To|carry-hogan,</P>
<P>We return you Thanks for your &s;everal Speeches, which are very agreeable to us; they contain Mat|ters of &s;uch great Moment, that we propo&s;e to give them a very &s;erious Con&s;ideration, and to an|&s;wer them &s;uitably to their Worth and Excellence: And this will take till To-morrow Morning, and when we are ready, we &s;hall give you due Notice.</P>
<P>You tell us you have beat the <HI>French</HI>; if &s;o, you mu&s;t have taken a great deal of Rum from them, and can the better &s;pare us &s;ome of that hot Liquor, to make us rejoice with you in the Victory.</P></Q>
<P>The Governor and Commi&s;&s;ioners ordered a Dram of Rum to be given to each, in a &s;mall Dram-Gla&s;s, which the Governor called a <HI>French</HI> Gla&s;s.</P>
