<SALUTE>MY DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had la&s;t the plea&s;ure of writing to you from this city, in which I gave you a particu|lar de&s;cription of the lands in this &s;tate, and in the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, together with the mode of &s;ettlement, and the manner in which they are to be purcha&s;ed, I have made a tour through the province of Upper Canada, and &s;hall endeavor to give you a particular and impartial account of that country, &s;o far as I have travelled through it, with its laws, government, and commercial advantages. In my letter from Albany, I mentioned that I went to that city by water, from thence I proceeded to Schenectady, fifteen miles by &s;tage, Schenectady is a hand&s;omely &s;ituated little town on the banks of the Mohawk river, inhabited mo&s;tly by Low.

Dutch, but from the appearance of the place, one would imagine it a de&s;erted village, the hou&s;es be|ing generally old, &s;mall, and mo&s;tly &s;hut up, but &s;urrounded by the fine&s;t flats of interva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l land you can po&s;&s;ibly imagine, which continue to the &s;ource of that river. The de&s;olate appearance of this town was accounted for to me by the current of Indian trade turning down the River St. Lau|rence, &s;ince the revolution. It has, however, the pro&s;pect of becoming a flouri&s;hing place, ere long, by the va&s;t increa&s;e of the &s;ettlements to the we&s;t of it, the produce of which mu&s;t centre there.&mdash;At this place I took an open boat, na|vigated by three men, in which I pa&s;&s;ed to Lake Ontario, without any other interruption than two &s;hort portages, one at the little falls of half a mile, round which they are now cutting a canal; the other of one mile, at Fort Stanvix, about one hundred miles we&s;t of Schenectady; at which place we leave the Mohawk river, and de&s;cend the current to O&s;wego, one hundred miles more to the we&s;t, where the Briti&s;h hold a po&s;t at the entrance of Lake Ontario, commanded by a cap|tain, from whom I received every mark of civili|ty and attention. A Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Officer is al&s;o &s;tationed there to prevent an illicit trade being carried on between the United States and the Bri|ti&s;h Colonies. No merchandize i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, nor furs out,

are permitted to pa&s;s this po&s;t, without a pa&s;&s;port from the Governor of Upper Canada; but &s;ettlers moving into that province to re&s;ide, are permitted indi&s;criminately to pa&s;s with all uten&s;ils of hu&s;band|ry, hou&s;hold furniture, and &s;tores for their own consumption. &mdash;The high prices which hatters' fur at pre&s;ent command in the United States is the only inducement I conceive for &s;muggling pa&s;t that po&s;t, for except a few articles imported from the Ea&s;t Indies, I found the retail &s;hops at King|&s;ton and Niagara, &s;elling as low, and many articles, particularly woolens, lower than in the City of Philadelphia.</P>
<P>From O&s;wego, ve&s;&s;els &s;ail to Niagara, King&s;ton, and any other port on the lake; but &s;ettlers more frequently continue along the &s;outh &s;hore of the lake to Niagara, about one hundred and twenty miles in the &s;ame open boats which bring them hither, as they are generally manned by them|&s;elves. But finding a ve&s;&s;el here ready to &s;ail for King&s;ton, I di&s;mi&s;&s;ed my boatmen, and embar|ked in her for that place, about twelve hours fail.</P>

Laurence, the banks of which are thick &s;ettled down to Lake St. Francois, where the provin|ces of Upper and Lower Canada are divided. This river is navigable for ve&s;&s;els of one hundred tons, and upwards, to O&s;wegatche, &s;eventy miles below King&s;ton, but ve&s;&s;els &s;eldom go down the river, as the fort which is at King&s;ton &s;erves as a depo&s;it for all the public &s;tores, provi&s;ion, and merchandi&s;e for the upper po&s;ts.</P>
<P>The land immediately about King&s;ton, is co|vered by valuable quarries of lime-&s;tone, and through all the &s;ettlements round it are plenty of thin valuable &s;tones, which are con&s;idered by the inhabitants rather as an acqui&s;ition than detri|ment to their plantations. The mo&s;t flouri&s;hing part of this &s;ettlement is round the bay of Kenty, the &s;oil of which is rich, ea&s;y worked, and pro|duces from one to three crops, without any other cultivation than what is done by the iron tooth harrow, and yields from 20 to 30 bu&s;hels of wheat to the acre; tho&s;e lands are &s;omewhat heavy timbered, having va&s;t quantities of the &s;ugar|maple, hickory and ba&s;s wood, and in &s;ome places white pines of a &s;urpri&s;ing height, but where the latter grows the land is more &s;andy, and al|though it is warm, &s;weet land, it is not &s;o &s;tony as the maple or oak land. This bay is &s;eventy

miles in length, beginning about twenty miles South We&s;t from King&s;ton, leaving a neck of land from two to twelve miles wide, between it and the lake, all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which is &s;ettled, and round the whole bay &s;o thick &s;ettled, that their im|provements already meet, and form the appear|ance of a beautiful old &s;ettled country. This bay and the creeks emptying into it, abound in great quantities of wild fowl, and fi&s;h of various kinds.</P>
<P>From King&s;ton I proceeded to Niagara, in a &s;chooner of upwards of one hundred tons burthen acro&s;s this little &s;ea of fre&s;h water; a &s;ea it may ju&s;tly be called, for we were a great part of the time for three days out of &s;ight of the land; though pa&s;&s;ages have been made in twenty hours; we enter the Niagara river between the fort and the town called Newark, with a beautiful pro&s;|pect of both.</P>
<P>The fort &s;tands in a commanding &s;ituation, on a point formed by the junction of the river and lake, upon the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the river, and is a re|gular fortification, in good repair, and well gar|ri&s;oned.</P>
<P>The mouth of this river affords a &s;afe and co|pious harbour, &s;ufficiently large for half the Bri|ti&s;h navy.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="029236_0008_0FDFF66384A2A928">
The town of Newark is &s;ituate in latitude 43 north, on the We&s;t banks of the river, extend|ing along the lake about a mile, enjoying in the &s;ummer the fre&s;h breezes from this little &s;ea, in almo&s;t every direction, plentifully &s;upplied with fi&s;h at all &s;ea&s;ons of the year. In the winter here are caught by &s;eines, quantities of white fi&s;h, which &s;eem to be peculiar to that river, they are generally from two to &s;ix pounds weight, and are considered the be&s;t fi&s;h in the lakes; be&s;ides there &s;turgeon, ba&s;s, and many other excellent fi&s;h, are in great plenty; &s;almon are taken in all the creeks round the lake; the&s;e varieties of fi&s;h are not only e&s;teemed a luxury, but a great a&s;&s;i&s;tance to new beginners in &s;upporting their families, many laying in a half dozen barrels or more for their winter's u&s;e.</P>
<P>The land about the town of Newark for many miles, though not &s;o good as the land further back is well inhabited each way upwards of fifty miles around. &mdash;What gave me a more parti|cular knowledge of this &s;ettlement was, being intimate with the Surveyor-General, a gentle|man of liberal education, good information, and indefatigable in the duties of his office, by which means he has collected notes, from the different field-books of his Deputies, of the &s;oil, timber,
<PB N="11" REF="029236_0009_0FDFF6669D234250">
and &s;treams, of all that country; and &s;uch parts as I went over I found his notes very correct, and by no means exaggerated. In many places there is little more for the farmer to do, than cut a &s;ufficiency of timber to fence his fields, girdle or ring the remainder, and put in the harrow, for in few places only is it nece&s;&s;ary to make u&s;e of the plough, till the &s;econd or third crop, there being little or no under bru&s;h; yet in many pla|ces, there is beautiful white pine, oak and black walnut timber; &s;ugar wood which is al&s;o found here in plenty mixed with beach, hickory, and ba&s;s wood.</P>
<P>At Newark re&s;ides the Governor who&s;e cha|racter is well known in England, and is de&s;erved|ly held here in high e&s;timation. &mdash;Here are al&s;o mo&s;t of the principle officers of government, be&s;ides many other gentlemen of re&s;pectability who form a very intelligent and agreeable &s;ocie|ty.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides Newark there are &s;everal important &s;ituations in this part of the province, which bid fair to become places of con&s;equence, the mo&s;t important of which are, the landing places at each end of the portage, Fort Erie, the head of
<PB N="12" REF="029236_0010_0FDFF66AB184F8B0">
Lake Ontario, and York, <HI>called</HI> by the natives Torento.</P>
<P>The lower landing or Queen&s;ton is about &s;e|ven miles up the river from Newark, where the ve&s;&s;els di&s;charge their cargoes, and take in furrs collected from three to one thou&s;and five hundred miles back, there have I &s;een four ve&s;&s;els of &s;ixty and one hundred tons burden unloading at the &s;ame time, and &s;ometimes not le&s;s than &s;ixty waggons loaded in a day, which loads they carry ten miles to the upper landing place or Chipawa Creek, three miles pa&s;t the great falls. This port|age is an encrea&s;ing &s;ource of wealth to the farm|ers for many miles round, who carry from twenty to thirty hundred weight for which they get one &s;hilling and eight pence N. Y. currency, per hun|dred weight, and generally load back with furrs &amp;c.&mdash;From Chipawa the merchandize is tran&s;|ported in batteaux to Fort Erie a di&s;tance of eighteen miles and are &s;hipped there on board of ve&s;&s;els for Detroit and Michilamackinac. &mdash;Detroit I was told was a plea&s;ant country, though a low and mar&s;hy &s;oil, more noted for its furr trade, than its agriculture.</P>
<P>At the head of Lake Ontario, about fifty miles we&s;t from Newark a &s;mall town is laid out and
<PB N="13" REF="029236_0011_0FDFF66C59E739C0">
public &s;tores are building, being a central place between Newark, York and Detroit, from thence a road of twenty two miles to the grand river is cut our and cro&s;&s;es that river about fifty miles above its entrance into Lake Erie, and continues in a &s;outhern direction to the river La Trenche, now called the <HI>Thames,</HI> which empties it&s;elf into Lake St. Clair, about twenty miles above Detroit. Settlements are making <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> road, and along the river <HI>Thames</HI> partial ones are made for an ex|tent of eighty or ninety miles in length. &mdash;On the&s;e two rivers are exten&s;ive open flatts of land equal to tho&s;e of the Mohawk river, on which may be cut a &s;ufficiency of hay for many thou&s;and head of cattle yearly; the lands on this road are of an excellent quality and in many places light timbered, in others covered with thri&s;ty oak, black walnut, &s;ugar maple, beach and lindar.</P>
<P><HI>York</HI> formerly <HI>Torento</HI> is &s;ituate on the be&s;t harbour round the lake, oppo&s;ite Niagara, and about forty miles di&s;tance acro&s;s the lake, but round by land near one hundred miles, along the &s;hore of which great quantities of fi&s;h are caught; a town is here in great forwardne&s;s, and &s;hould the &s;eat of government be removed from Newark thence, as is contemplated, it will &s;oon become a flouri&s;hing place. &mdash;From this a road is cut out
<PB N="14" REF="029236_0012_0FDFF66DF6A040C0">
acro&s;s to Lake Simcoe, or the Rice Lakes thirty three miles, the outlet of which empties it&s;elf in|to Lake Huron a di&s;tance of forty five miles from Lake Simcoe, thirty &s;ix miles in length; this rout affords an ea&s;y communication with Michilimac|kinac. &mdash;From York to that lake, a tier of lotts of two hundred acres each, is laid out on each &s;ide of this road called <HI>Dundas-&s;treet,</HI> granted on the expre&s;s condition of building and improving on them, within one year from the time they are taken up; many of the&s;e are now built upon and occupied.</P>
<P>On the ea&s;t &s;ide and joining the rear of the&s;e lotts is a &s;ettlement of near one hundred German families, on an excellent tract of land, much of which is open, white oak woods; the&s;e Germans came on this &s;ummer, furni&s;hed with every thing nece&s;&s;ary to make their &s;ituation comfortable and enable them to improve their land to advantage, and no doubt in a &s;hort time will make a fine &s;et|tlement; they are &s;upported by a company who have liberally &s;upplied them. With teams, farm|ing uten&s;ils and provi&s;ions, &s;ent them a Clergyman of their own country, and are about to build them mills, a church, and &s;chool hou&s;e.</P>

If this generous example was with equal &s;pi|rit followed by a few more companies, it would add to the population of the country, more than any other mode yet pur&s;ued. &mdash;There is &s;till plenty of vacant lands of the be&s;t kind, and &s;uch as &s;hew a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;ettle and improve them, meet from the Governor every encouragement they merit, who makes liberal grants to all &s;uch as do actually bring on &s;ettlers, and prove them|&s;elves de&s;irous of promoting the intere&s;t of the country, the whole of which is well adapted for rai&s;ing wheat, Indian corn, and other &s;ummer grain; flax (where the land has borne a few other crops) &s;ucceeds remarkably well, and the face of the whole country yields gra&s;s in abun|dance; hops of a good quality grow here &s;pon|taneou&s;ly, al&s;o a variety of wild fruits &s;uch as plumbs, mulberry, blackberry, &s;trawberry, ra&s;p|berry and grapes. &mdash;Orchards are in great for|wardne&s;s, for the age of the &s;ettlement, &s;ome of which already bear fruit. &mdash;Peaches, cherries, and currants are plenty among all the fir&s;t &s;et|tlers. &mdash;The farmers rai&s;e great quantity of pork, without any other expence than a little indian corn, for a few weeks previous to killing, and often kill their hogs out of the woods, well fat|ted on nuts; in many places &s;alt &s;prings have been di&s;covered, and &s;ome of them already work.

ed to &s;uch advantage that in all probability that article, which generally comes heavy in the inte|rior part of a country, may in a &s;hort time be af|forded here, as low as in many of the old &s;ettled places in the United States.&mdash;Many valuable &s;treams for water works, run in every direction through this country; and upon &s;ome of them are mills built, which prove very lucrative to the owners, particularly &s;aw-mills, from the quantity of good timber and great demand of boards, as more buildings are going on than carpenters and ma&s;ons can be found to fini&s;h: &s;tones being &s;carce, bricks are generally u&s;ed in ma&s;on work.</P>
<P>This &s;ettlement was begun by a few di&s;banded troops after the peace of 178<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and being but little known by the people of the United States, who had imbibed an opinion that it was entirely under control of the military, few emigrants bent their cour&s;e this way, till they were con|vinced of the civil government, being well e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, and upon a con&s;titution happily adopted to the minds of the people, &s;ince which numbers of re&s;pectable inhabitants have come in from the different States. Some of whom have come in their waggons quite from North Carolina, but as there is a &s;pace of countiy, for about &s;eventy miles, between Niagara and the Gene&s;ee coun|try,
<PB N="17" REF="029236_0015_0FDFF675F88FB898">
where the roads are not &s;ufficiently open for waggons, they tran&s;port them from the mouth of that river to Niagara in boats. However this ob&s;truction will probably be &s;oon removed, when it will be a plea&s;ant jaunt to get into a carriage at Niagara, and drive to this city, which may be effected without difficulty, in about two weeks, par|ticularly by &s;leighs in the winter.&mdash;The mode of &s;ettlement generally pur&s;ued here, and which &s;eems be&s;t calculated to &s;ave expence, is by two, three or more men coming on in the &s;ummer, who throw up a log hou&s;e each, put in a field of wheat, and return for their familier, which they bring on the following &s;pring, by the rout be|fore de&s;cribed pad O&s;wego, if by water; but &s;uch as come by land, bring their families as far as the mouth of Gene&s;ee river, there take boat, and &s;end their cattle by land. This country from the reduction till the year 1790, was included in the province of Quebec, and from the year 1774, the civil admini&s;tration was ve&s;ted in a Governor and Legi&s;lative Council, at that time be&s;t adapt|ed to the ideas of the people, who were mo&s;t entirely French, and from prejudice, preferred that form of government, being mo&s;t analogous to what they had been accu&s;tomed to prior to the conque&s;t of Canada, but at the conclu&s;ion of the late di&s;&s;entions between Great Britain and Ame.

rica, Upper Canada, then called the back po&s;ts, was held out as an a&s;&s;ylum to tho&s;e who had ad|hered to the unity of the Briti&s;h Empire, and who generally came under the denomination of Loy|ali&s;ts. &mdash;From the peace to the year 1790, go|vernment delegated to land boards the power of granting lands to any applicants, if men of mora|lity and &s;obriety.</P>
<P>In the year 1790, the wi&s;dom of the Briti&s;h government, was eminently evinced in dividing that large country, into two &s;eparate govern|ments, and granting to each a con&s;titution, on the mo&s;t liberal and di&s;intere&s;ted principles, a con&s;titution for freedom and the ju&s;t rights of man, perhaps unequalled in the hi&s;toric page, with all the advantages, enjoyed by the Briti&s;h colonies in America previous to the revolution, and with many additional, the Briti&s;h Parlia|ment having renounced for ever the right of tax|ation. &mdash;Here no man's property for any cau&s;e whatever, is taxed, directly or indirectly; the Briti&s;h government mo&s;t generou&s;ly paying for even the &s;urveying of the lands, and the whole &s;upport of the civil e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>You will naturally wonder, how with all the&s;e advantages this country has hitherto e&s;caped the

notice and keen ob&s;ervations of Land Speculators, and the elogeums of Pamphleteers too frequently the hired and u&s;eful a&s;&s;i&s;tant of the former cla&s;s of men, but this I have found is accounted for on the be&s;t of principles. The Indians being un|doubtedly the original proprietors of the &s;oil, and it even has and continues to be the policy of the Briti&s;h government to extingui&s;h their right, by fair and equitable purcha&s;es. Large purcha&s;es of this kind has been made from time to time by go|vernment, as the population of the country re|quired, and as yet there is not a &s;ingle in&s;tance of di&s;&s;atisfaction on the part of the Indians; having thus liberally paid them for their lands, very ad|vantageous terms are held out to actual &s;ettlers, (the only cla&s;s which at fir&s;t can enrich any coun|try) who get a grant of two hundred acres each. However for the encouragement of men, com|manding the means of improving on a larger &s;cale, by proper application they get a hand|&s;ome additional quantity. By this means the &s;ub&s;tantial farmer becomes the inhabitant, and large tracts to the detriment of any country, ne|ver lie wa&s;te.</P>
<P>Had I not re&s;olved on examining minutely, and judging for my&s;elf, I &s;hould never have become acquainted with a country which for richne&s;s of

<P>The noble river St. Laurence &s;upplies this coun|try for an extent of two thou&s;and miles with com|mercial advantages inferior to none on this &s;ide of the Atlantic. &mdash;Conceive to your&s;elf ve&s;&s;els of &s;ix hundred tons burthen, unloading all kinds of Bri|ti&s;h goods at the port of Montreal, five hundred miles from the &s;ea, and again receiving in return, furs from the interior parts of the country, as far as the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi is known to the we&s;tward, and the waters emptying into Lake Superior from the northward. &mdash;This town, when the banks of

the different lakes and rivers are &s;ettled by hu&s;|bandmen, which is at no di&s;tant period, mu&s;t have a va&s;t increa&s;e of trade, for without doubt all Briti&s;h manufactures, through the&s;e va&s;t water communications, will come much cheaper, through the whole cour&s;e of its windings, than can be af|forded from any other quarter. Goods on impor|tation being liable to no duty; which will un|doubtedly give this country a va&s;t advantage over the new &s;ettlements that I de&s;cribed in my former letters; indeed nature points out this place as the emporium of trade for the people inhabiting both &s;ides of the&s;e lakes and rivers emptying into them as far as they extend to the we&s;t. From Montreal <HI>boats</HI> called by the Canadians batteaux, containing twenty five barrels bulk, are worked by four men to King&s;ton, a di&s;tance of nigh two hundred miles up the river in the cour&s;e of &s;ix or eight days, and again return in three, loaded with furs, pot|a&s;h, and other produce of the country.&mdash;Ve&s;|&s;els, generally &s;chooners, receive the goods at King&s;ton, and convey them in a &s;hort time to the landing or Queen&s;ton, below the great fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ls of Niagara.

and Michigan. The expences incurred during all this rout are comparatively tri&s;ling, as you will ob&s;erve there is but one portage, and that only ten miles in the cour&s;e of this communication. And when one reflects on the temperate climate, rich &s;oil, And other natural advantages of this in|terior country, you anticipate a great population in a &s;hort time.&mdash;The &s;treights of Niagara, from its peculiar &s;ituation, being the channel through which all the produce of the va&s;t country above mu&s;t pa&s;s, is looked forward to as a place of the fir&s;t con&s;equence, and where a farmer will at all times find a market for his produce, the tran&s;|port being ea&s;y from thence to the Atlantic.&mdash; Here have I &s;een with amazement that famed ca|taract, which exceeds every de&s;cription I have ever heard of it, but it would be idle in me to pretend to give you an idea of it&mdash;It &s;trikes the eye with more grandeur and &s;ublimity than the pen can convey.&mdash;Among&s;t many other natural curio&s;ities, a &s;pring, about two miles above the&s;e falls, attracts the attention of the curious; emit|ting a gas, or inflammable air, which, when con|fined in a pipe, and a flame applied to it, will boil the water of a tea-kettle in fifteen minutes:&mdash; whether this may hereafter be applied by machine|ry, to u&s;eful purpo&s;es, time will determine.</P>

It was lately di&s;covered in clearing away and burning: the bru&s;h under the bank of the river, to erect a mill, and was ob&s;erved after the bru&s;h was con&s;umed to burn for days together, to the great a&s;toni&s;hment of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>About three hundred miles we&s;t of this is Fort Detroit, &s;ituate on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the &s;treights, between Lake Erie and Huron, around which, a French &s;ettlement was e&s;tabli&s;hed before the re|duction of the province, but attending more to the Indian trade than agriculture, made but little progre&s;s as farmers. The Engli&s;h &s;ettlements lately begun on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore are already in a higher &s;tate of cultivation, however the French have line orchards, from which Niagara is at pre&s;ent &s;upplied with cyder and apples. About one hun|dred miles we&s;t from Detroit lies a valuable coun|try on the waters emptying into the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, now unhappily conte&s;ted by the United States and the natives of the &s;oil.</P>
<P>To the northward of Detroit about three hundred and fifty miles, lies Fort Michillmacki|nac, on an i&s;land between Lake Huron and Michi|gan, is about five miles round, and an entire bed of gravel incapable of cultivation, but mo&s;t remarka|ble for being the general depot and grand rendez|vous

Spani&s;h &s;ettlements many miles down the Mi&s;&s;i|&s;ippi are &s;upplied with Briti&s;h goods through this channel, to much greater advantage than from New Orleans, where the rapids of the Mi&s;|&s;i&s;ippi oppo&s;e almo&s;t un&s;urmountable difficulties in a&s;cending it.</P>
<P>This fort, the forts of Detroit, Niagara, and O&s;wego, fell within the United States, when the lines of &s;eparation were drawn, at the treaty of peace, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and eighty three; fort Miami, which was built by the Briti&s;h lately, is al&s;o within tho&s;e lines.&mdash; Previous to that peace, &s;tores of depo&s;it had been occupied at the foot of the Miami rapids, where the fort now &s;tands, and the annual pre&s;ents to the Indians, which they have long been in the habits of receiving from the Briti&s;h government, were there i&s;&s;ued. This place was prudently cho|&s;en for thar purpo&s;e, in order to prevent the In|dians from coming through the &s;ettlement, croud|ing about and mixing with the troops at Detroit, where the too frequent u&s;e of &s;piritous liquors would have occa&s;ioned numerous quarrels and ac

<P>Hitherto, have I &s;aid little re&s;pecting the abo|rigines of this country. &mdash;Various are the opinions entertained by different people, and different hi&s;torians have ri&s;ked conjectures how this conti|nent was originally peopled; their own ideas of it are not le&s;s curious than extraordinary. They do not believe, nor have rhey the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;tige of traditional memorial to induce them to believe, but that they are a di&s;tinct race of men from the whites, &s;ome of the mo&s;t intelligent among&s;t them will at this day relate in detail the natural and original hi&s;tory of them&s;elves and the conti|nent they live upon. &mdash;They fully believe in a good and evil &s;pirit, and in a future &s;tate of re|wards and puni&s;hments, and have certain times in the year for their particular modes of wor&s;hip, when they more generally endeavor to appea&s;e and avert the wrath of the bad, than invoke the good Spirit, to which, however, after favorable crops, a good hunt, or &s;ucce&s;s in war, they, in a &s;ervent manner, return thanks. &mdash;They &s;ay that the face of the globe was fir&s;t covered with one great water, in which the turtle was the principal
<PB N="27" REF="029236_0025_0FDFF690626C83E8">
inhabitant. That the Great Spirit cau&s;ed this turtle to grow to &s;uch a &s;ize that the waters could no longer float it, and in con&s;equence, it became &s;tationary, continuing to grow until the mo&s;s and rubbi&s;h collecting on his back, became a &s;oil, and &s;hot forth herbs, bu&s;hes, and at length trees, and now forms this great i&s;land (as they term it) up|on which they were created a di&s;tinct race of men, and that the Great Spirit made, after them, eve|ry kind of bea&s;ts and birds of the fore&s;t, for their food and u&s;e, (from the fir&s;t twelve of which they took the names of their twelve tribes,) and that the&s;e are as different in their kind, from tho&s;e given by the Great Spirit to the white people, for their u&s;e, as they are them&s;elves from us.&mdash; That they encrea&s;ed in &s;trength and numbers, till the white people came among&s;t them, and in|troduced their habits, with the u&s;e of &s;trong drink, <HI>to which they</HI> ju&s;tly impute their degene|racy.</P>
<P>When the feeling mind re&s;lects on the former &s;ituation of the&s;e credulous people; the various deception practi&s;ed on them under the ma&s;k of friend&s;hip, the artle&s;s, and faithful attachment they bear to the white people where they are treated with, upon &s;eeming principles of ju&s;tice

and candor, it mu&s;t truly &s;ympathize with them in their pre&s;ent gloomy pro&s;pects.</P>
<P>This people who were two centuries ago po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the whole of this va&s;t continent, afford|ing them &s;pontaneou&s;ly every comfort of life, without rivals in the enjoyment of it, now dri|ven back &s;tep by &s;tep, to the la&s;t &s;pot of their fertile &s;oil, and that conte&s;ted. Conte&s;ted by the very people whom they have been led to con|&s;ider, as their brothers, fathers and protectors. &mdash; Prejudice from education, habit, and particular &s;ituations in life may warp the minds of the be&s;t of men, but a virtuous and penetrating mind, will always e&s;timate in a proper degree, the re|lation and ties they have a claim to on us, if it is only from our &s;uperior cultivation of mind and manners. Would it not therefore argue a great|er degree of virtue, and redound more to the honor of humanity, for Chri&s;tians, bordering on the remains of their country, to turn their at|tention to the civilization of the&s;e people, than to endeavor by art and arms to extirpate them from the face of a country, which they conceive to have been given by the Great Spirit to them alone. It is idle to &s;ay that people of their quick ideas, and lively imagination, are incapable of ci|vilization, for where education, and a proper at|tention
<PB N="29" REF="029236_0027_0FDFF6967B16B968">

<P>Thus have I now as generally made you ac|quainted with this great country, as correctly as my &s;hort &s;tay in it would admit of; but I can|not conclude this without giving you a piece of information, equally new to every body here as to me.</P>
<P>For many years pa&s;t adventurers have attempt|ed without &s;ucce&s;s to cro&s;s to the Pacific Ocean. The honor of this arduous ta&s;k was left to a Mr. Alexander Mac Kenzie, a partner in the North-|we&s;t fur company, who lately returned by the way of the lakes, having fully accompli&s;hed the object of his undertaking in the cour&s;e of two years, by tra|ver&s;ing the Continent of America to the north|ward of we&s;t, over va&s;t mountains covered with ice, which obliged him to make new canoes, where|ever
<PB N="30" REF="029236_0028_0FDFF698EA27EE60">
he had the waters in his favor. On his ar|rival on this coa&s;t, &s;even weeks fail from Canton in China, and 2 degrees to the north of Nootka Sound, he &s;ound the Indians without fire-arms, but furni&s;hed with &s;ome cloathing and ornaments, principally Spani&s;h manufacture. The Indians accompanying him were not under&s;tood by tho&s;e on that coa&s;t, and appeared to be perfect &s;trangers to one another. It was with difficulty he could reconcile them to him as a white man, on ac|count, as he under&s;tood, of &s;ome injury given them by people of his color, a few days before that time. The&s;e are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the Americans from the port of New York, who had touched there in their trade with China.</P>
<P>After remaining a few days and making the nece&s;&s;ary observations, he returned and brought along with him &s;ome valuable &s;kins of the &s;ea offer, and other natural curio&s;ities, peculiar to that coa&s;t; but as the gentleman him&s;elf has it in idea to go &s;oon to London, I have little doubt but he will meet with the reward due to his ex|ertions, and give to the world an account of the wild and uninhabited tract he traver&s;ed.</P>
