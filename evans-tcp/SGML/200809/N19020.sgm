<Q><BIBL>ROMANS IX. 18.</BIBL> Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>UNBIASSED rea&s;on clearly dictates, that God has an original inalienable right and propriety in all things; and particularly in mankind&mdash;a right to make what u&s;e of them he plea&s;es. And that he is not obliged to render an account, why he deals with one in this, and another in that manner. Becau&s;e, as creatures, they are his ab&s;olute property, and, as &s;inners, are obnoxious to his wrath.</P>
<P>BUT it is evident that the divine di&s;po&s;al, relatively to mankind, has met with great oppo&s;ition and com|plaint&mdash;Is a doctrine very di&s;agreeable to human pride&mdash;And is what the Apo&s;tle labored to e&s;tabli&s;h, in the text and context, again&s;t the carnal rea&s;onings, and &s;elf-conceited preten&s;ions of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and all <HI>others</HI> who have the audacity to deny, or que&s;tion God's ab&s;olute right, and uncontrolable authority to di&s;po&s;e of men and things according to his &s;overeign plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e in this chapter is the re|jection of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and the exten&s;ion of &s;aving mercy to the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> The former prided them&s;elves in their de&s;cent, their privileges, and their legal righte|ou&s;ne&s;s. On the&s;e grounds they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> expectations of life and &s;alvation. And claiming the peculiar favour and protection of the Almighty, they de&s;pi&s;ed the <HI>Gentile</HI> world; as out<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">s from God, and not de&s;erving their regard.

<P>THE FIRST PART, Containing an attempt to explain the text.</P>
<P>To do this orderly and clearly it is nece&s;&s;ary to inve&s;tigate the meaning of God's having mercy on whom he will have mercy.</P>
<P>MERCY, when applied to God in the Bible, is &s;ome|times u&s;ed with greater latitude, than at others. The divine character, generally &s;ummed up in holi|ne&s;s, is &s;ometimes expre&s;&s;ed by mercy. But mercy, more &s;trictly con&s;idered, is a branch of holine&s;s&mdash;is of the nature of benevolence; yet doth imply &s;ome|thing in the object towards which it is exerci&s;ed, whereby it is differenced from benevolence in a gen|eral view. Benevolence re&s;pects being&mdash;intelligent exi&s;tence. Mercy re&s;pects the ill-de&s;erving. Great favor may be &s;hown, much good, may be conferred upon the innocent: but favor &s;hown to the innocent is not of the nature of mercy, &s;trictly con&s;idered: becau&s;e mercy is contrary to de&s;ert; or the good, which is the effect of mercy, is &s;o far from being merited by tho&s;e who are the recipients, that they de&s;erve only evil.</P>
<P>WE may, therefore, define mercy applied to God by &s;aying, It is the divine inclination to do good to the ill de&s;erving.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to this definition, mercy may be di&s;|tingui&s;hed from compa&s;&s;ion, as well as from bene|volence. It is true, that mercy and compa&s;&s;ion are oftentimes u&s;ed &s;ynonimou&s;ly; yet &s;trictly &s;peaking, mi&s;ery is the object of compa&s;&s;ion, without joining to it either innocence, or ill de&s;ert: whereas mercy has re&s;pect to mi&s;ery well de&s;erved.</P>
<P>Now, as all mankind are &s;inners, "for there is none righteo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, no, not one," and con&s;equently, odi|ous to divine purity, and obnoxious to divine wrath: &s;o all the good things men enjoy ought to be con|&s;idered,
<PB N="9" REF="024750_0007_0FC864D89BD52710">
as flowing to them from mercy. The in|numerable ble&s;&s;ings con&s;erred upon them in the pre|&s;ent &s;tate, are mercies equally numberle&s;s. Where|by it appears, that in different ways and degrees, all have experience of mercy from God. It is evident, however, that, in the text, mercy is not to be un|der&s;tood in this general &s;en&s;e. <HI>Here</HI> re&s;pect is had, not only to di&s;criminating, but al&s;o to &s;aving mercy. That which, in a lower &s;en&s;e, may be called di&s;cri|minating mercy, is exerci&s;ed towards many who are not the &s;ubjects of &s;aving mercy. Di&s;criminating mercy is exerci&s;ed in temporal ble&s;&s;ings and &s;piritual privi|leges. Some abound in riches; and enjoy better health of body than others do. Some are under bet|ter advantages in re&s;pect to &s;ociety: and better ad|vantages for mental and moral improvement, than o|thers are. And there are more powerful operations of the Holy Spirit on the minds and con&s;ciences <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ome, than of others, who yet may be left to &s;tifle their convictions, and never experience the change of regeneration and a &s;aving conver&s;ion to God. And in &s;uch re&s;pects it may be truly &s;aid, He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy.</P>
<P>THAT, in the text, particular reference is had to &s;aving mercy, is evident from the tenor of the di&s;|cour&s;e in this chapter. For it was obviou&s;ly Paul's de&s;ign to vindicate the divine conduct, in rejecting the body of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> nation, and extending &s;av|ing mercy to the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> Moreover, it is &s;uffici|ently evident from the latter part of the ver&s;e. Whom he will he hardeneth. For they who are not hardened, are &s;oftened, i.e. renewed and &s;anctified: becau&s;e there is no medium between the&s;e. There|fore &s;aving mercy is <HI>here</HI> intended.</P>
<P>As there is a difference in the exerci&s;e of divine mercy, in other re&s;pects; &s;o there is a mo&s;t wide and important difference in the exerci&s;e of &s;aving mercy. It is not be&s;towed upon all mankind; but upon &s;ome
<PB N="10" REF="024750_0008_0FC864D9C87C4D60">
only&mdash;even tho&s;e upon whom God is plea&s;ed to be|&s;tow it. In the text, and many other places, the exer|ci&s;e of mercy is re&s;olved into the will or &s;overeign plea&s;ure of the Deity. No rea&s;on is <HI>he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> a&s;&s;igned only his will. He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy. What then, are we to under&s;tand by this mode of &s;peaking?</P>
<P N="1">1. WE are not to conceive that God acts from mere will, as this is generally under&s;tood, when applied to men. The potentates of the earth are frequently re|pre&s;ented as acting from <HI>mere</HI> will, to &s;ignify that they act tyrannically, contrary to all rea&s;on and equity; by di&s;playing their power, in numberle&s;s ways of vio|lence and oppre&s;&s;ion, to gratify their ambition and a|varice. The will of God, in the exerci&s;e of his &s;a|ving mercy, is not <HI>arbitrary</HI> in any &s;uch &s;en&s;e. For no wrong is done to tho&s;e upon whom he doth not be|&s;tow his mercy: neither is partiality exerci&s;ed, in the &s;en&s;e that being partial or a re&s;pecter of per&s;ons, im|plies any thing mean and unworthy.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE are not to conceive that God acts without wi&s;dom&mdash;without a regard to that which upon the whole is be&s;t, in the choice he makes of the&s;e, upon whom he is determined to be&s;tow his &s;aving mercy. The divine will is not blind, nor capricious. Altho' we are not able to inve&s;tigate them, no doubt there are good and &s;ufficient rea&s;ons, why God be&s;tows his &s;aving mercy upon &s;ome, and not upon others. And why tho&s;e very per&s;ons upon whom he doth be|&s;tow it, rather than others. But, in re&s;pect to this mat|ter, his tho'ts are not our tho'ts&mdash;are high above them, as the heavens are high above the earth. It is not, becau&s;e &s;ome are more noble, wi&s;e, and mighty than o|thers; or have done more to recommend them&s;elves, than others have done. It is tho&s;e, upon whom, in his infinite wi&s;dom, God &s;ees be&s;t to be&s;tow it: Who&s;e &s;alvation will mo&s;t effectually conduce to his own glory, and the illu&s;trious di&s;play of his grace.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="11" REF="024750_0009_0FC864DE78E6D178">3. "HE hath mercy on whom he will have mercy" &s;ignifies to us; That God hath and exerci&s;eth a right to do what he will with his own.</P>
<P>ALL men being &s;inners, he is not obliged to exerci&s;e his &s;aving mercy towards any. And it lies in his own brea&s;t to determine on whom he will confer it; and on whom he will not. By this, we &s;ee, the exerci&s;e is <HI>ar|bitrary,</HI> in re&s;pect to <HI>&s;ubjects.</HI> Neither they upon whom &s;uch mercy is be&s;towed, nor they upon whom it is not be&s;towed, have any claims to advance. There|fore, if any are &s;aved; their &s;alvation mu&s;t be the ef|fect of <HI>mere</HI> mercy, &s;overeign grace.</P>
<P N="4">4. WE may farther ob&s;erve, That this mode of &s;peaking doth naturally lead us to conceive; that as mercy is the only &s;pring of &s;alvation: So in the exer|ci&s;e of it, God is &s;elf moved, and perfectly free. No|thing out of him&s;elf, &s;trictly &s;peaking, doth induce God to &s;hew mercy. The exerci&s;e of &s;aving mercy, in its whole extent, flows from his infinitely free &s;elf-mo|ved propen&s;ity. It is true, God exerci&s;es mercy in a view of the guilt, and ruin of &s;inners: For if &s;in had not taken place, there would have been no room for the exerci&s;e of it. Therefore we may humbly con|ceive, Sin was permitted to take place, to prepare the way for the manife&s;tation of divine ju&s;tice, in the pu|ni&s;hment of &s;ome; and that the infinitely merciful heart of the Deity might work forth, in the pardon &amp; &s;alvation of others: And that the mo&s;t important ends, re&s;pect|ing the Deity him&s;elf, and the created intelligent &s;y&s;|tem, might be accompli&s;hed in the final re&s;ult. But the whole &s;cene is laid, and the exerci&s;e conducted in &s;uch a manner, as to make it manife&s;t; that when God be&s;tows his &s;aving mercy upon any, he acts of, from, and for him&s;elf. And the regard &s;hown to tho&s;e upon whom he confers his &s;aving mercy is rather &s;ubordi|nate, than original and ultimate: or if ultimate, yet certainly, not &s;upreme.</P>
<P>ON the whole, God hath determined the objects of
<PB N="12" REF="024750_0010_0FC864DFC13858F0">
&s;aving mercy according to the coun&s;el of his own will, and &s;o as to an&s;wer his own mo&s;t important ends. Not needing, nor a&s;king any a&s;&s;i&s;tance; not looking upon him&s;elf amenable to any creature. And without pay|ing the lea&s;t attention &amp; regard to tho&s;e circum&s;tances and di&s;tinctions, men are apt to think, ought to influ|ence in &s;uch a determination, and con&s;equent proce|dure. For, "Who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his coun&s;ellor?" in&s;tructing and aid|ing him in what he ought to re&s;olve and do. "Or who hath fir&s;t given to him?" Certainly none.</P>
<P>MANY are ready to think it is proper they &s;hould be the objects of divine favor, on account of their.de|&s;cent; or becau&s;e they have &s;uperior abilities and ad|vantages; or becau&s;e they have made a profe&s;&s;ion of religion, are civil and moral in their behaviour, and if not &s;inle&s;s, are le&s;s criminal &amp; unworthy than many oth|ers they could ea&s;ily name. Or becau&s;e they have taken abundant pains to recommend them&s;elves to divine fa|vor. Indeed there is a great variety of particulars, implying different circum&s;tances and di&s;tinctions which take place among mankind, on account whereof they are apt to imagine, God will &s;hew them his &s;alvation. But the Almighty doth not regard tho&s;e di&s;tinctions, in which weak mortals are &s;o apt to pride them&s;elves. He doth not make le&s;s comparative guile and unwor|thine&s;s the ground of his choice; For upon &s;ome he be&s;tows &s;alvation who&s;e guilt is very great&mdash;even up|on the chief of &s;inners. Some of one; and &s;ome of a|nother nation are &s;aved. Some de&s;cended from wor|thy progenitors; others not &s;o de&s;cended. Some of &s;uch a &s;tation and employment are cho&s;en; others of the like &s;tation are rejected. And where there is a &s;i|milarity of circum&s;tances, it is probable, &s;ome are &s;a|ved; others not.</P>
<P>We cannot determine beforehand who will be &s;a|ved, From the &s;ituation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">en are in, the way they
<PB N="13" REF="024750_0011_0FC864E139442FD0">
pur&s;ue, the exertions they make, we cannot know that God hath &s;aving mercy in de&s;ign for them. It is not po&s;&s;ible to know that God will be&s;tow mercy upon one, or another before he doth be&s;tow it; unle&s;s he &s;hould be plea&s;ed to reveal his purpo&s;e, in re&s;pect to certain per&s;ons, to &s;ome of his &s;ervants. But he is not wont often, if ever to do this. And although the &s;ituation &s;ome per&s;ons are in, who have not as yet obtained re|generating grace, may render it more probable they will obtain mercy, than that others in general will, and more probable in the given &s;ituation, that they in par|ticular &s;hall obtain, than it would be, were they not in &s;uch a &s;ituation: Yet no &s;ituation&mdash;no external circum|&s;tances, or even &s;tate of mind per&s;ons may be in antece|dently to regeneration, ought to be con&s;idered, as ha|ving the lea&s;t influence in the divine determination, re&s;pecting the be&s;towment of his &s;aving mercy.</P>
<P>ON the other hand; when we find &s;aving mercy, in event is conferred upon per&s;ons, who were in &s;uch a particular &s;ituation, external and internal, we are to conceive they were brought thereunto, becau&s;e God purpo&s;ed to &s;ave them.</P>
<P>HAVING thus &s;tated what we are to under&s;tand by God's having mercy on whom he will have mercy. The way is prepared.</P>
<P>II. To inve&s;tigate the meaning of the counterpart to this, And whom he will he hardeneth.</P>
<P>IT is true that he hardeneth whom he will, as it is that he hath mercy on whom he will; becau&s;e the &s;ame pen of in&s;piration a&s;&s;erts both. They on whom he hath mer|cy are regenerated, are united to Chri&s;t, are ju&s;tified, and &s;hall be &s;aved: &s;eeing, as hath been ob&s;erved, there is a particular reference, not to common and pro|mi&s;cuous; but to &s;pecial &s;aving mercy. Con&s;equently, by the hardened we are to under&s;tend tho&s;e who are, or &s;hall be le&s;t in an imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">t unbelieving &s;tate to the la&s;t&mdash;to their eternal ruin and de&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">n. For the e|vent of remaining impenitent and unbelieving to the
<PB N="14" REF="024750_0012_0FC864E38F822B48">
end of this probationary &s;tate will be endle&s;s ruin &amp; mi|&s;ery. Of the truth of this doctrine the Scriptures afford abundant proof. At pre&s;ent, I &s;hall only refer to the 22d. ver&s;e, which is not only in point, but deci&s;ive. For <HI>here</HI> we are taught, that God will &s;hew his wrath, and make his power known on the ve&s;&s;els of wrath fitted to de&s;truction, and endured with much long &s;uffering. Now &s;hould the&s;e ve&s;&s;els be eternally happy after ha|ving been ever &s;o many millions of ages in torment; they would be ve&s;&s;els of mercy, and not ve&s;&s;els of wrath. And &s;alvation, rather than de&s;truction would be their end&mdash;that to which they are fitted.</P>
<P>WE are compelled to under&s;tand the text to mean being hardened in this awful &s;en&s;e. The &s;cope of the Apo&s;tle evinces it: which was the rejection of the <HI>Jews</HI> through unbelief to their de&s;truction, and the exten|&s;ion of &s;aving mercy to the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> The adduced in&s;tance of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> who&s;e heart was hardened to his de&s;truction, proves it. For this in&s;tance is brought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to &s;upport the declaration &s;tated in the text. As he hardened <HI>Pharaoh</HI> to his de&s;truction: &s;o whom he will he hardeneth to their de&s;truction. And more than all this, the antithe&s;is u&s;ed in the text doth nece&s;&s;arily require &s;uch a con&s;truction. Becau&s;e, although there are various re&s;pects and degrees, according to which, &s;everal per&s;ons may be &s;aid to be hardened, and even the &s;ame per&s;on at different times. Yet if any &s;hould be hardened in impenitence ten, twenty, forty years or more: but &s;hould be renewed by divine grace, and &s;aved at la&s;t; upon &s;uch God would have mercy in the &s;en&s;e of the text. Therefore it is evident, this would de&s;troy the contra&s;t&mdash;would leave no oppo&s;ition be|tween tho&s;e upon whom he hath mercy, and tho&s;e whom he hardeneth.</P>
<P>THE expre&s;&s;ion, he hardeneth, is u&s;ed in a metapho|rical &s;en&s;e. It is borrowed from particular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that are called hard; &s;uch as a &s;tone, piece of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> or dried clay, which are not ea&s;ily penetrated, broken

and changed. They will re&s;i&s;t a con&s;iderable power applied to alter them. And &s;ome bodies naturally hard, being worked upon, will grow harder &s;till. Whereas &s;ub&s;tances that are &s;oft will readily yield, giv|ing way to impre&s;&s;ions made upon them. Hardne&s;s, when applied to the mind, doth import an unaptne&s;s to be rightly moved and affected; a bent to re&s;i&s;t the truth, and oppo&s;e the authority and commands of God. Leaving the metaphor&mdash;a hard is the &s;ame with a &s;elf|i&s;h, proud, unholy heart. And according to the degree of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and oppo&s;ition to truth and holine&s;s is the degree of hardne&s;s. And la&s;tly, what&s;oever &s;erves to render men's minds &s;tupid, aver&s;e to good, proud and &s;tubborn, may be &s;aid to harden them.</P>
<P>WHAT being hardened doth intend may now be &s;een. But the great que&s;tion is, what we are to under&s;tand by, whom HE will HE hardeneth? Or in what &s;en&s;e may it be truly &s;aid God hardeneth any man? For it needeth not to be a laboring point in our minds, that he &s;hould harden whom he will, if we can find a con&s;i&s;tent &s;en&s;e, in which he may be &s;aid to harden any one. Be|cau&s;e that which will &s;erve to vindicate his character in hardening any one, may &s;erve as well to vindicate it in hardening another, and as many as he &s;hall &s;ee fit to har|den. For, if doing it in one in&s;tance implies no deni|al of his holine&s;s; doing it in ten, or ten thou&s;and in|&s;tances will imply no denial thereof&mdash;It being ea&s;y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to &s;ee, that where there is no denial or oppo&s;ition in a &s;ingle in&s;tance; there will be none in ever &s;o many in|&s;tances of the &s;ame nature. The que&s;tion returns, what are we to under&s;tand by whom HE will HE hard|eneth?</P>
<P>THIS indeed is a tremendou&s;ly delicate &s;ubject; and by u&s;ing great freedom and boldne&s;s of enquiry there may be danger of our conceiving, and uttering what &s;hall be exceedingly reproachful to the Deity. And there &s;eemeth to be danger on both hands; So that by &s;teering beyond the proper point to avoid <HI>Scylla</HI>; we
<PB N="16" REF="024750_0014_0FC864EA1B9D2B08">
fall into <HI>Charybdis.</HI> And this I apprehend we &s;hall do. If on one hand, we wholly deny any interpo&s;ition <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and divine di&s;po&s;al in re&s;pect to the taking place of &s;in, and a continued &s;eries&mdash;a confirmed &s;tate in wicked|ne&s;s, ending in eternal ruin and de&s;truction. Or by a|&s;cribing more, in any e&s;&s;ential re&s;pect, to a divine inter|po&s;ition and di&s;po&s;al than ought to be a&s;cribed, on the other. And it may not be ea&s;y to determine which would be mo&s;t injurious and reproachful. Yet, per|haps, it is not po&s;&s;ible for us to fix the point preci&s;ely, by a&s;certaining with exactne&s;s, how far the will, and di&s;po&s;al of the Deity are concerned in this delicate af|fair.</P>
<P>To proceed with humility and due caution in the en|quiry, it may be ob&s;erved, that &s;ince God hardeneth whom he will, it is certain his will, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, mu&s;t be concerned in hardening men; and the active verb hardeneth doth import &s;ome divine agency and di&s;po|&s;al. So that, without flat contradiction to the plaine&s;t a&s;&s;ertion of the pen of in&s;piration, we cannot wholly ex|clude the will and agency of God. From this however, it doth not follow, that there is the &s;ame agency or exertion of divine power in producing the event called &s;in, and hardne&s;s of heart, as there is in producing the ef|fect called holine&s;s. And notwith&s;tanding the divine will &amp; di&s;po&s;al are concerned in the former; they may be, &amp; we may have rea&s;on to apprehend they are concerned in a very different &s;en&s;e and manner, in the latter, i. e. in the communication of holine&s;s, and con&s;ervation of &s;aints in a holy &s;tate. Indeed this mode of &s;peaking doth not nece&s;&s;arily imply, that God exerts any imme|diate influence at all in hardening men. For, &s;hould we &s;uppo&s;e &s;in&mdash;hardne&s;s of heart to take place in con|&s;equence of the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of a particular kind of influ|ence, which by many hath been called &s;upernatural in|fluence, producing, &amp; continuing holine&s;s in creatures: Even as the ab&s;ence of light is darkne&s;s; as night fol|lows the going down of the &s;un, without any po&s;itive
<PB N="17" REF="024750_0015_0FC864EDD087C408">
immediate exertion to produce night or darkne&s;s&mdash;I &s;ay, on &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition, the manner of &s;peaking in the text, would not be improper. For the night&mdash;dark|ne&s;s is &s;ometimes repre&s;ented as being made, yea crea|ted. And, we ordinarily &s;ay the ab&s;ence of light cau|&s;eth darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>IT is true, that &s;in is in oppo&s;ition to holine&s;s; &s;elf|i&s;hne&s;s to benevolence; &s;o that we may invariably &s;ay &s;elfi&s;h and benevolent exerci&s;es are contrary to each o|ther. And it is certain, that holy benevolent exerci&s;es in creatures are the effect of divine exertion; do take place in con&s;equence of the influence of the Holy Gho&s;t upon the heart. For God worketh in the &s;aints, "both to will and to do of <HI>his</HI> good plea&s;ure." It is al&s;o evi|dent, that men do not act independently of God, when they act &s;infully. God doth not withhold every kind of influence and &s;upport. If he &s;hould they would cea&s;e to be. There would be no ability, no &s;ufficiency for any kind of perception, and exerci&s;e. "In him we live, move, and have our being." This is true in re&s;pect to the wicked, as it is in regard to others. But it doth not follow, becau&s;e holy, and &s;inful exerci&s;es are oppo&s;ite to each other, and holy exerci&s;es are the effect of a divine &s;upernatural operation; that &s;inful ex|erci&s;es mu&s;t be the fruit of any &s;imilar exertion of di|vine power. For the &s;ame efficiency that produces an effect of one kind may not be nece&s;&s;ary to produce an effect of another, and an oppo&s;ite kind. Allowing the &s;ame cau&s;e may produce different, and even oppo&s;ite effects; as the &s;ame fire that melts wax, and fu&s;es me|tals will dry, and harden humid &s;oft clay: Yet, per|haps, in nature's ample field we &s;hall not find an in|&s;tance, affording a deci&s;ive proof, that the &s;ame cau&s;e doth produce oppo&s;ite effects in the &s;ame &s;ubject; un|le&s;s there is a materil variation in &s;ome circum&s;tance, or circum&s;tances attending the &s;ubject, and then indeed as to the ca&s;e in hand, the &s;ubject is not the &s;ame. And many con&s;iderable effects &s;eem to be produced, or oc|ca&s;ioned
<PB N="18" REF="024750_0016_0FC864F849C66160">
by privation of influence, rather than by po&s;i|tive exertion. A river congealed &s;o as to form a bridge &s;ufficiently &s;trong for an army, with ammunition and baggage to pa&s;s &s;afely over, is a great, real, &s;en&s;ible ef|fect. How is it produced! Not by the pre&s;ence and powerful influence of the &s;un; but by his ab&s;ence, or the faint influence of his beams. It is true, there can be no ice without water; and there can be no water without an omnipotent hand to create it: al&s;o, the pre&s;ence and power of God in the beams of the &s;um is nece&s;&s;ary to keep the water in a warm flowing &s;tate. But that, the beams of the &s;un being withdrawn, there is need of a &s;uperadded influence to turn the flowing water into a congealed &s;tate may not ea&s;ily, if at all, be made to appear. And who would choo&s;e to affirm? There may not be &s;omething as great, and even more con&s;iderable in re&s;pect to moral voluntary effects, than in regard to tho&s;e which are natural and mechani|cal: where there is no pretence of any proper agency in the &s;ubjects of the effects, or their mediate cau&s;es.</P>
<P>LET it be farther ob&s;erved, That, in regeneration and &s;anctification, the Scriptures a&s;cribe a peculiar in|terpo&s;ition and influence to God, This argues that &s;inful exerci&s;es are not the effect of divine influences in the &s;en&s;e holy excrci&s;es are. Should it be urged, "that although the extrin&s;ic influence which produces holi|ne&s;s in creatures is not the &s;ame with that which produ|ces &s;in: Yet as creatures have no independent &s;ufficien|cy for any kind of perception and volition, there nece&s;|&s;arily mu&s;t be an extrin&s;ic divine influence, and as im|mediately exerted, to the production of &s;inful, as of ho|ly volitions." An&s;wer. This will not follow. Be|cau&s;e the &s;infulne&s;s of volitions may proceed from a privative, rather than a po&s;itive cau&s;e. In other words. According to Scriptural repre&s;entation there &s;eemeth to be a peculiar, and what hath been called &s;u|pernatural influence, in producing holy perceptions and volitions, which influence is over and above that
<PB N="19" REF="024750_0017_0FC864FA0A4D5C10">
general influence&mdash;extrin&s;ic exertion, nece&s;&s;ary to pre|pare the way for perceptions and volitions, to take place in creatures. i. e. to enable them to under&s;tand and choo&s;e. If &s;o; then there is not a nece&s;&s;ity of influence tantamount to this, to prepare the way for &s;inful exerci&s;es to take place. Becau&s;e the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the kind of influence, which hath been mentioned, may be attended with this con&s;equence. Sinful exerci&s;es may be conceived of as taking place, without any other kind of influence&mdash;extrin&s;ic exertion, than what is nece&s;&s;ary, to enable man to under&s;tand, choo&s;e and act.</P>
<P>To &s;um up the whole, I think it is more &s;afe, and doth better accord with the Scriptures to &s;ay, That God orders the occa&s;ion; and for wi&s;e, and important ends, doth not interpo&s;e that influence, which in the given circum&s;tances, would be nece&s;&s;ary to prevent &s;in and impenitence; than that he cau&s;es &s;in and impeni|tence by his own po&s;itive and immediate energy. And that he permits, which is to &s;ay doth not effectually prevent, than that he produces, or infu&s;es &s;uch hard|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>SOME very bold inquirers, and rea&s;oners, may cen|&s;ure this permitting; ordering the occa&s;ion; not pre|venting; as making u&s;e of expre&s;&s;ions, too lenient and timid. And may urge, that &s;uch a &s;tating of the ca&s;e is only an expedient to relieve the imagination; but doth afford no relief to any real difficulty. In regard to &s;uch per&s;ons I would farther ob&s;erve. Although I do not a&s;&s;ert, that the &s;uppo&s;ition of &s;uch a direct, po&s;i|tive agency in the taking place, the continu nce, and prevalence of wickedne&s;s in the &s;y&s;tem, as they may in|&s;i&s;t upon; would nece&s;&s;arily involve the idea, or con&s;e|quence that God is the author of &s;in, in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e, as to render the &s;inner le&s;s criminal, and &s;in le&s;s odious to the divine being, than it would appear to be on any other &s;uppo&s;ition, and the Scriptural repre&s;entatious make it to be. And although the abettors of the di|rect, po&s;itive agency of the Deity in the production of
<PB N="20" REF="024750_0018_0FC864FB815308F8">
all moral evil, for ought I choo&s;e to &s;ay to the contra|ry, may have clear conceptions of the evil of &s;in, ju&s;t de&s;ert of the &s;inner, and God's infinite hatred and aver|&s;ion to &s;in: Yet there &s;eems to be &s;omething in it which doth naturally, if not nece&s;&s;arily &s;hock the mind. And, as I apprehend, hath a powerful tendency to pre|judice the minds of people in general, and of many pi|ous well-meaning per&s;ons (who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> able to pur&s;ue references metaphy&s;ically refined) again&s;t the &s;y&s;tem of truth revealed in the Bible, and lead them to entertain very unworthy thoughts of the ble&s;&s;ed God, the glori|ous fountain of being and good. And after all, it &s;eems to be a philo&s;ophical point, re&s;pecting the manner of accompli&s;hing the divine purpo&s;es, about which it is not nece&s;&s;ary the world &s;hould be exerci&s;ed.</P>
<P>As Paul drew the con&s;equence, whom he will he hardeneth, from what is &s;aid concerning <HI>Pharaoh</HI>&mdash;our conceptions may po&s;&s;ibly be a&s;&s;i&s;ted, by bringing into view what is narrated of <HI>him</HI> in the hi&s;tory given by Mo&s;es.</P>
<P>GOD &s;ent Mo&s;es to demand of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> permi&s;&s;ion for the children of I&s;rael to go, and offer &s;acrifice in the wilderne&s;s; but told him, that he would harden <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s heart &s;o that he &s;hould not let the people go. When Mo&s;es delivered the me&s;&s;age to <HI>Pharaoh</HI>; he an&s;wered, "who is the LORD that I &s;hould obey his voice to let I&s;rael go? I know not the LORD, nei|ther will I let I&s;rael go." <HI>Pharaoh</HI> made the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> &s;erve with hard bondage in brick, and mortar. His pride and covetou&s;ne&s;s could not con&s;ent, to loo&s;e the <HI>&s;ervice</HI> of &s;o many men. Therefore, in&s;tead of com|plying with the demand God made by Mo&s;es he or|dered a heavier ta&s;k to be impo&s;ed upon <HI>them.</HI> By the divine command, Mo&s;es began to work &s;igns and wonders to convince the king of <HI>Egypt,</HI> that he was really &s;ent by God, and influence him to comply with his demand. <HI>Pharaoh</HI> called for his magicians; <HI>Jan|nes</HI> and <HI>Jambres</HI> with&s;tood Mo&s;es. And &s;o long as
<PB N="21" REF="024750_0019_0FC864FD052980B0">
they did &s;omething in imitation of the miracles wrought by Mo&s;es and Aaron, this &s;erved to fix him in his re&s;olution, not to let the people go. When the magicians could not produce lice; but owned them&s;elves defeated, and that what Mo&s;es did was the finger of God; it is not improbable <HI>Pharaoh</HI> thought Mo&s;es did this; becau&s;e he had greater &s;kill in magic, than <HI>Jannes</HI> and <HI>Jambres,</HI> and thereby his heart was hardened. When the magicians were farther contoun|ded: &s;o that they could not &s;tand before Mo&s;es, be|cau&s;e of the blains that broke forth upon them; as they did upon man and bea&s;t throughout all the land of Egypt. It is &s;aid,."the LORD hardened the heart of <HI>Pharaoh.</HI>" Yet, after this it is &s;aid, "<HI>Pharaoh</HI> &s;inned yet more, and hardened his heart he and his &s;ervants." And when the judgments &s;ucceeding the hail were in|flicted it is repeatedly &s;aid, "the LORD hardened the heart of <HI>Pharaoh</HI>". And although at la&s;t, by the de|&s;truction of all the fir&s;t born in <HI>Egypt, Pharaoh</HI> was con&s;trained to let the people depart; they had not gone far before he recanted, and pur&s;ued them with his chariots and hor&s;emen, the LORD hardening the heart of the king of <HI>Egypt</HI> to do this, and the hearts of the <HI>Egyptians.</HI> Which is thus expre&s;&s;ed: "the en|emy &s;aid I will pur&s;ue, I will overtake, I will divide the &s;poil: my lu&s;t &s;hall be &s;atisfied upon them; I will draw my &s;word, my hand &s;hall de&s;troy them."</P>
<P>HERE a mo&s;t wonderful &s;cene was laid open: re|markable in re&s;pect to manife&s;ting the extreme wick|edne&s;s, and hard-hear edne&s;s of <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> and his <HI>&s;er|vants</HI>; and di&s;playing the power and glory of JEHO|VAH in the deliverance of his people, and the puni&s;h|ment and overthrow of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and the <HI>Egyptians.</HI>" "For the LORD triumphed gloriou&s;ly by throwing the hor&s;e and his rider into the &s;ea." Upon this occa|&s;ion it was proper to a&s;k in a &s;train of devout admir|ation, as Mo&s;es did, "who is like unto thee O Lord among the gods! who is like thee, glorious in holi|ne&s;s,
<PB N="22" REF="024750_0020_0FC864FE94B00158">
fearful in prai&s;es, doing wonders?"</P>
<P>No one who reads and attends to the whole narra|tion ought to entertain the lea&s;t doubt, whether this &s;cene, antecedently to its being opened, was compre|hended in the divine plan. And it is evident, there was a previous certainty that <HI>Pharaoh's</HI> heart would be har|dened. And that God rai&s;ed him up for this very pur|po&s;e, that he might &s;hew his power in him, and that his own glorious name might be declared throughout all the earth.</P>
<P>BUT how are we to under&s;tand this? Shall we &s;ay, "that God intended to make his power known by har|dening <HI>Pharaoh's</HI> heart, in virtue of his own po&s;itive immediate energy, working &s;uch hardne&s;s in his heart?" An&s;wer. This doth not appear from the hi&s;|tory: but rather this. God intended to make his pow|er known in many &s;tupendous miracles wrought to convince, and per&s;uade <HI>Pharaoh</HI>; who&s;e heart he did not &s;ee fit, by any po&s;itive efficiency, to prevent grow|ing hard, and increa&s;e in obduracy, notwith&s;tanding all that was &s;aid and done calculated to reduce him to a willing &s;ubjection and compliance. And to make his power and name glorious by triumphing over him, as he did at la&s;t, in his de&s;erved de&s;truction.</P>
<P>IT may be ob&s;erved, that three modes of expre&s;&s;ion are u&s;ed in &s;etting forth the hardne&s;s of <HI>Pharaoh's</HI> heart. The LORD hardened his heart; his heart was hardened: and he i. e. <HI>Pharaoh</HI> him&s;elf hardened his heart. According to this account, his hardne&s;s is &s;ometimes a&s;cribed, neither to God, nor to <HI>Pharaoh</HI> directly, leaving room to &s;ay it was occa&s;ioned, in part, by certain circum&s;tances. And although the&s;e circum&s;tances were ordered by the wi&s;e holy provi|dence of God: yet this may be far from amounting to a direct po&s;itive divine efficiency in producing &s;uch hardne&s;s. And it is evident, there was no &s;uch agency of the Deity in the affair as to prevent his hardne&s;s of heart being with propriety a&s;cribed to <HI>Pharaoh</HI> him|&s;elf.
<PB N="23" REF="024750_0021_0FC86506E221DAA0">
And as it is &s;ometimes a&s;cribed to <HI>him&s;elf</HI> it is apparent, there was no compul&s;ion&mdash;there was no o|ther, than a moral nece&s;&s;ity, of his remaining in a har|dened &s;tate. Or what con&s;i&s;ted in his own inclination and choice. <HI>He</HI> acted &s;pontaneou&s;ly; <HI>he</HI> cho&s;e to gra|tify his avarice by detaining the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> in his &s;er|vice; notwith&s;tanding all that was &s;aid and done, to gain a compliance with what was demanded of him by Mo&s;es, in the name of JEHOVAH.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, the narration given by Mo&s;es only ren|ders it nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould maintain, that hardening the heart of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> was comprehended in the divine plan&mdash;That it was previou&s;ly certain he would conti|nue in a hardened &s;tate, God not being obliged thereto, and not &s;eeing fit to prevent it, by the efficacious influ|ences of his &s;pirit and grace. And in this, or &s;ome &s;en&s;e like this, it may be &s;aid God hardeneth whom he will. He hath determined whom he will harden, and upon whom he will have mercy. There is a previous certainty in re&s;pect to a certain number unknown to us, but perfectly well known to God, who will be harden|ed to their eternal ruin: notwith&s;tanding all that hath been, is, or &s;hall be done, to prevent it. That is to &s;ay, who after their hardne&s;s and impenitent heart, will trea&s;ure up to them&s;elves wrath and damnation, by de|&s;pi&s;ing the riches of his goodne&s;s, long-&s;uffering and forbearance. Whom the goodne&s;s of God (however well adapted in it&s;elf to that purpo&s;e) will not lead to repentance; nor the divine &s;everity drive from the love, and pur&s;uit of their evil ways. In all of whom God will make his power known; and at la&s;t, not only declare his name throughout all the earth; but render it divinely glorious to the utmo&s;t extent of creation, and to the endle&s;s ages of eternity; as he will al&s;o, the exceeding riches of his grace in their &s;alvation, upon whom it &s;hall plea&s;e him to have mercy.</P>

<P>WHEN the P&s;almi&s;t &s;aith, "power belongeth unto God," he no doubt means, that original ab&s;olute pow|er belongs to him, inherently, and e&s;&s;entially. That he doth not in the lea&s;t degree derive his power from any other, and is not at all dependent on any other for the exerci&s;e of it. And &s;trictly &s;peaking, that he doth not derive it from him&s;elf; any more than he derives his exi&s;tence from him&s;elf: But this power is in him ne|ce&s;&s;arily, with a nece&s;&s;ity ab&s;olute, like that of his being.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT may ea&s;ily be &s;een, that the denial of ab&s;olute perfection, perfection original and every way exempt from derivation, implies a denial of divine exi&s;tence, although, in our conception, and the order of &s;tating things, we place exi&s;tence fir&s;t. For divine exi&s;tence is the exi&s;tence of a being ab&s;olutely perfect. There|fore,
<PB N="25" REF="024750_0023_0FC8650C03E3F8C0">
&s;ince in the idea of Deity ab&s;olute perfection is included, we cannot admit the idea of &s;uch exi&s;tence, without being compelled to admit the idea of ab&s;olute perfection, as nece&s;&s;arily pertaining thereunto: And to deny &s;uch perfection is impliedly, to deny the exi&s;t|ence to which the perfection doth nece&s;&s;arily belong.</P>
<P>WE may indeed Without this conceive of exi&s;tence, and call it Deity: however it is not Deity, &s;trictly &s;peaking, but our own fal&s;e conception, and vain ima|gination. It may be proper al&s;o to ob&s;erve here, That the will of God ever is, and nece&s;&s;arily mu&s;t be wi&s;e and good in the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e: becau&s;e it is repugnant to the idea of ab&s;olute perfection to admit the po&s;&s;ibili|ty of the contrary. For, if his will, in any in&s;tance and re&s;pect, &s;hould be unwi&s;e, not good this would be a proof of the want of ab&s;olute perfection.</P>
<P N="3">3. WHEN we con&s;ider God as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing ab&s;olute per|fection, originally and independently. And al&s;o con&s;i|der him as the creator of all things. Of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things!" That he hath an original inalienable right and propriety in all things, to order and di&s;po&s;e of them according to his wi&s;dom and good plea&s;ure, is implied therein, or doth flow therefrom by infallible con&s;equence. In &s;o|much, that it will amount to a denial of his ab&s;olute per|fection, and his divine exi&s;tence, by nece&s;&s;ary implicati|on, to deny he hath &s;uch an inherent inalienable right.</P>
<P N="4">4. As it thus appears, That it belongs to God to di&s;po&s;e of all creatures and things, according to the coun&s;el of his own will: Therefore it belongs to God &mdash;is his e&s;&s;ential prerogative to have mercy on whom he will, and to harden whom he will; as the matter hath been explained. For a denial of this, is, in ef|fect, a denial of his right to di&s;po&s;e of all creatures and things as he plea&s;eth; becau&s;e this is comprehen|ded in his having &s;uch an original inalienable right. Con&s;equently, by what hath been &s;aid, a denial of this will involve a denial of his ab&s;olute perfection&mdash;his di|vine
<PB N="26" REF="024750_0024_0FC8650D892CE468">
exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>IN all the divine arrangements, perhaps, there is no higher, brighter di&s;play of prerogative; than what is exerci&s;ed in the Salvation and Damnation of &s;inners. And we may not limit the divine prerogative, by ad|mitting the exerci&s;e of it in other matters; but deny|ing that it doth extend to this. However contrary to the pride, the overweening conceits men have of them&s;elves; and however they may be di&s;po&s;ed to &s;et up, and maintain their notions of independent power and liberty to choo&s;e for them&s;elves, and fix <HI>even</HI> their eternal &s;tate: Yet God a&s;&s;erts it to be his prerogative to have mercy on whom he will, and to harden whom he will. And on good ground; for it doth e&s;&s;ential|ly and nece&s;&s;arily belong to him.</P>
<P>ARG. II. Ju&s;tice and mercy are e&s;&s;ential to the di|vine character&mdash;a character, complete in all perfection. Therefore it belongs to God, to have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and to harden whom he will har|den.</P>
<P N="1">1. IF ju&s;tice, <HI>even</HI> punitive ju&s;tice, be not a perfec|tion it is an imperfection. And, if it be an imperfection, then the character of Jehovah revealed in the Scrip|tures, "To me vengeance belongeth, I will repay &s;aith the Lord," is a bad character. And the Bible doth not give us the knowledge of the true God. Like|wi&s;e, if mercy be not a perfection, it is an imperfec|tion. For, in a moral con&s;ideration, there is no me|dium between perfection and imperfection. We &s;ee then, it is impo&s;&s;ible that mercy and ju&s;tice &s;hould not be a beauty, or a blemi&s;h in the divine character. And we &s;ee with equal evidence, that mercy and ju&s;tice are included in the idea of ab&s;olute perfection.</P>
<P N="2">2. IF mercy and ju&s;tice are e&s;&s;ential to the divine character; it is proper that the&s;e &s;hould be made to appear in exerci&s;e, in events. The propriety of the&s;e being made to appear is the &s;ame, with the propriety of the divine character or ab&s;olute perfection, being
<PB N="27" REF="024750_0025_0FC8651078272710">
made to appear: becau&s;e the character cannot be ma|nife&s;ted, if any thing e&s;&s;entially di&s;tingui&s;hing in the character, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eft out. Moreover, the character cannot be &s;een, cannot be under&s;tood by creatures; unle&s;s it is manife&s;ted in &s;ome &s;uitable effects, or work, For none but God him&s;elf, by intuition, &s;elf con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s can know who, and what he is.</P>
<P>By this it appears, that in denying the propriety of mercy and ju&s;tice being exerci&s;ed, there is implied a denial of the propriety of ab&s;olute perfection being made to appear, as belonging to the divine character. And this will run us into a denial of ab&s;olute perfecti|on: and in fine the denial of a God&mdash;will land us in athei&s;m.</P>
<P N="3">3. IF &s;in had not taken place, never had and never &s;hould take place, there would have been no room and opportunity; and con&s;equently no po&s;&s;ibility, that pu|nitive ju&s;tice and redeeming mercy &s;hould be exerci|&s;ed. It is no limitation of divine power, on &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition, to &s;ay there would not be a po&s;&s;ibility. For, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, the po&s;&s;ibility implies a contradic|tion. And it is no limitation of divine power to &s;ay God cannot do what implies a contradiction, A con|tradiction is not the object of power. Hence it fol|lows, That &s;in mu&s;t be comprehended in the projection of a plan, de&s;igned and calculated to exhibit ab&s;olute perfection of character to the minds of creatures. And in the &s;ame view, a divine decree relative to &s;in in e|vent, and &s;uch a di&s;po&s;al of things in the &s;y&s;tem, as &s;hould be followed with this event, wholly by the fault of the creature, was nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P N="4">4. SIN hath taken place in this lower world, by the fault of man, according to the determinate coun&s;el and foreknowledge of God. And, in un&s;earchable wi&s;|dom, he hath devi&s;ed a method, that of redemption by Chri&s;t, according to which mercy can be exerci&s;ed in the &s;alvation of &s;inners, con&s;i&s;tently with ju&s;tice, and to the honor of the divine law and government. It there|fore
<PB N="28" REF="024750_0026_0FC8651556489ED0">
belongs to God&mdash;is his e&s;&s;ential prerogative to be&s;tow mercy on whom he plea&s;es, and inflict de&s;erved puni&s;hment on whom he plea&s;es. Mercy on tho&s;e, in his un&s;earchable wi&s;dom, he finds it be&s;t &s;hould be made the &s;ubjects of mercy: And puni&s;hment on the re&s;t, the ve&s;&s;els of wrath fitted to de&s;truction, and en|dured with much long &s;uffering.</P>
<P>By this it is demon&s;tratively evident, That the de|termination of the character, &amp; di&s;po&s;al of the &s;tate and circum&s;tances of creatures, particularly the eternal &s;tate of men, is God's peculiar province, and e&s;&s;ential prero|gative. That it belongs to him originally, and inde|pendently; is what he cannot be dive&s;ted of by any, and indeed is that of which he cannot dive&s;t him&s;elf: It being e&s;&s;ential as ab&s;olute perfection, involving ju&s;|tice and mercy, is e&s;&s;ential; and the denial of it, in|ferring the denial of divine exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>ARG. III. GOD actually hath mercy on &s;ome, and hardeneth others, Therefore it belongs to him to have mercy on whom he will and to harden whom he will.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE fact is certain, becau&s;e it is a&s;&s;erted in the Holy Scriptures. He hardened <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his <HI>&s;ervants</HI> to their de&s;truction. He had mercy on <HI>Paul,</HI> and many <HI>others</HI> have been the &s;ubjects of his &s;aving mercy. The fact cannot be que&s;tioned, unle&s;s we will que&s;tion the truth of the Bible.</P>
<P N="2">2. IF it be &s;o done in a few in&s;tances or a &s;ingle in&s;tance of each &s;ort; it may be done in more, <HI>even</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s many as God &s;ees fit and be&s;t. And as the weight of objection, &s;uppo&s;ing any are di&s;po&s;ed to object, mu&s;t lie again&s;t his hardening whom he will; becau&s;e it may be fairly pre&s;umed none will find fault, that God exerci&s;es &s;a|ving mercy, except it be in this point of light, that he ex|erci&s;es it, toward &s;ome &amp; not others, tho&s;e toward whom he exerci&s;es it, being no le&s;s guilty &amp; ill-de&s;erving, an|tecedent to the exerci&s;e thereof, than tho&s;e in who&s;e favor he doth not exerci&s;e it. But this will bring the
<PB N="29" REF="024750_0027_0FC865186A9E0CA8">
objector to the other point, whom he will he harden|eth. I &s;ay, then, If God doth harden any&mdash;doth &s;o di&s;|po&s;e of things in the &s;y&s;tem that they are hardened to their eternal de&s;truction, as te&s;timony concerning fact evinces he hath done. Then it belongs to him, it is his province &s;o to do. For he never did, and it is impo&s;&s;i|ble he ever &s;hould act out of his real province, contra|ry to his e&s;&s;ential prerogative. It al&s;o follows; that it is his prerogative to harden whom, and as many as he will. For, if the thing it&s;elf implies any oppo&s;iti|on to ab&s;olute perfection&mdash;the holine&s;s of the Deity; &s;uch oppo&s;ition will be implied in a &s;ingle in&s;tance. And if one in&s;tance doth not imply oppo&s;ition; neither will two, ten, or ten thou&s;and; becau&s;e ten thou&s;and nothings are nothing.</P>
<P N="3">3. By what hath been &s;aid it is manife&s;t; that from the in&s;tance of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and the <HI>other</HI> in&s;tances men|tioned in the context, with great propriety the Apo&s;tle drew the con&s;equence. Therefor hath he marcy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hard|eneth. If he hardened <HI>Pharaoh</HI> he may harden <HI>whom</HI> he will. There can be nothing to object again&s;t his con|duct, let him do it in another, and ever &s;o many other in&s;tances, as many as he plea&s;es; any more than there is for his having done it in that in&s;tance.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t therefore prove, that he did not harden <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> and that he never hath hardened <HI>any</HI>; other|wi&s;e the con&s;equence will follow, let us make ever &s;o many, attempts to evade it.</P>
<P>ARG. IV. THE potter hath power over the clay, of the &s;ame lump to make one ve&s;&s;el unto honor, &amp; ano|ther to di&s;honor. Therefore it belongs to God to have mercy on whom he will, and to harden whom he will.</P>
<P>THIS illuminating proof is &s;ugge&s;ted by Paul him&s;elf as an an&s;wer to the objection &s;tated thus, ver&s;e 19. "Thou wilt &s;ay unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? for who hath re&s;i&s;ted his will?" After having &s;aid, "Nay but O man, who art thou that replie&s;t again&s;t
<PB N="30" REF="024750_0028_0FC8651B388E6C90">
God? Shall the thing formed &s;ay to him that formed it, Why ha&s;t thou made me thus? He adds, "Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the &s;ame lump to make one ve&s;&s;el unto honor, and another unto di&s;|honor?"</P>
<P>THE &s;ame compari&s;on is frequently u&s;ed to repre&s;ent God's &s;overeign power and uncontroulable authority in his di&s;po&s;al of men and things. I&s;aiah &s;aith XLV. 9. "Woe unto him that &s;triveth with his maker, <HI>Let</HI> the pot&s;herd <HI>&s;trive</HI> with the pot&s;herds of the earth. Shall the clay &s;ay to him that fa&s;hioneth it, What make&s;t thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?" And Jeremi|ah, XVIII. 2&mdash;7. "Ari&s;e and go down to the potter's hou&s;e, and there I will cau&s;e thee to hear my words. Then I went down to the potter's hou&s;e, and, behold he wrought a work on the wheels. And the ve&s;&s;el that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter; &s;o he made it again another ve&s;&s;el, as &s;eemed good to the potter to make it. Then the word of the LORD came to me &s;aying, O hou&s;e of I&s;rael, cannot I do with you as this potter? &s;aith the LORD. Behold, as the clay <HI>is</HI> in the potter's hand, &s;o <HI>are</HI> ye in mine hand O hou&s;e of I&s;rael."</P>
<P>HERE &s;everal things may be ob&s;erved. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. THE potter acts in regard to the clay ju&s;t as he plea&s;es. He holds no con&s;ultation with it; and if he &s;hould the clay could not inform him what is proper to be done. He only con&s;ults him&s;elf; he forms his own plan; he moulds and fa&s;hions the clay according to his own &s;kill, and plea&s;ure. Of the &s;ame lump he makes &s;ome into larger &s;ome into &s;maller ve&s;&s;els; &s;ome into one &s;hape, &s;ome into another, &s;ome he de&s;igns for this, &s;ome for that purpo&s;e, ju&s;t as he will&mdash;as he conceives will be&s;t an&s;wer his own ends; in di&s;playing his work|man&s;hip, or in gaining profit.</P>
<P N="2">2. IN this affair no one pretends to find fault. It is readily granted by all that the potter hath power over the clay; that it belongs to him&mdash;is his unque&s;tionable
<PB N="31" REF="024750_0029_0FC8651F4BAA1968">
prerogative to fa&s;hion the clay as he plea&s;eth.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT appears from the above cited pa&s;&s;ages, That as clay is in the potter's hand; &s;o are men, and all crea|tures in the hand of God. And that there is no room to que&s;tion his power, right and prerogative, to di&s;|po&s;e of them as he plea&s;eth; any more than to que&s;ti|on the power the potter hath over the clay, to mould and fa&s;hion it as he plea&s;eth.</P>
<P N="4">4. WE may add, that this figure is not &s;ufficient to give a full idea. Nor can any &s;imilitude be introdu|ced that will every way an&s;wer the purpo&s;e: Becau&s;e it is a prerogative ab&s;olutely without a parallel. Per|haps no figurative illu&s;tration can be devi&s;ed, better adapted to render the idea clear and familiar, than that of the potter and clay. But this fails. For, Should, it be a&s;ked, What right hath the potter to the clay? The an&s;wer mu&s;t be. He hath not an original underiv|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &amp; title to it. The potter doth not make the clay, he only fa&s;hions the clay already made to his hand; and made by God, as al&s;o was the potter him&s;elf. Therefore the potter hath not a right to the clay, as he would have, were he the maker of it. God grants him liberty to u&s;e the clay him&s;elf hath formed. So that it is only in a &s;econdary &s;en&s;e, and by derivation the potter hath the lea&s;t right to make u&s;e of clay for his work. Whereas the divine right and propriety in all creatures and things is ab&s;olutely original, and wholly underived. And it ought to be remembered, that men are at an infinitely greater di&s;tance from God than the clay is from the potter. And that he hath infi|nitely more important de&s;igns, to be accompli&s;hed in his di&s;po&s;al of men and things; than the potter hath in forming different ve&s;&s;els from the &s;ame lumps.</P>
<P N="5">5. WE may therefore argue from the le&s;s to the greater. If the potter hath power over the clay, of the &s;ame lump to make one ve&s;&s;el unto honor, and ano|ther unto di&s;honor: Much more doth it belong to God to determine the character, and di&s;po&s;e of the eternal
<PB N="32" REF="024750_0030_0FC86526CE587858">
&s;tate of men as he plea&s;eth. It belongs to him in a much higher degree, and in the mo&s;t ab&s;olute &s;en&s;e. And it appears, that God exerci&s;es conde&s;cention, when he compares his power and prerogative to that of the potter over the clay: Becau&s;e, although there is &s;ome likene&s;s; yet it repre&s;ents the ca&s;e only in a very faint manner. However, as no one pretends to que&s;tion the right of the potter to make what ve&s;&s;el he plea&s;es, and appropriate them to his own purpo&s;es: much le&s;s ought any to di&s;pute God's right to be&s;tow his &s;aving mercy on whom he plea&s;es, and withhold it from whom he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>ARG. V. EVERY po&s;&s;ible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">othe&s;is re&s;pecting the determination of the character and di&s;po&s;al of the e|ternal &s;tate of men, except that which is re&s;olved into the wi&s;dom, and good plea&s;ure of the Deity, is weak and in&s;ufficient if not impious and ab&s;urd. Therefore it belongs to God&mdash;is his e&s;&s;ential prerogative to have mercy on whom he will <HI>have, mercy,</HI> and to harden whom he <HI>will harden.</HI></P>
<P>To fini&s;h the &s;eries of argumentation. Let us for once &s;uppo&s;e, That God doth not claim it as his inalie|nable prerogative to determine the character, and di&s;|po&s;e of the &s;tate and circum&s;tances of creatures; and in particular the character, and eternal &s;tate of the indi|viduals of the human race. And then a&s;k, Who doth or &s;hall determine and order &s;uch a variegated, infinite|ly important &s;cene of things? And con&s;ider withal what the probable; yea certain con&s;equence mu&s;t be. In doing this it may be expected. That they who attend without prejudice, and with becoming &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and care, will be throughly convinced of the folly and ab&s;ur|dity of denying, or calling in que&s;tion, the divine pre|rogative to have mercy on whom he will, and to har|den whom he will.</P>
<P>I WOULD premi&s;e, That this &s;uppo&s;ition ought not to be admitted a &s;ingle moment, in any other view, than to manife&s;t the fal&s;hood, the va&s;t ab&s;urdity of that doc|trine
<PB N="33" REF="024750_0031_0FC8652BA0E635F0">
which teaches, that it doth not belong to God to exerci&s;e a wi&s;e and holy &s;overeignty in the &s;alvation and damnation of &s;inners. And this is to &s;ay, it doth not belong to God to exerci&s;e his ju&s;tice and mercy as he plea&s;es&mdash;as he &s;ees it to be nece&s;&s;ary, and be&s;t they &s;hould be exerci&s;ed. Unle&s;s I mi&s;take the point en|tirely, it doth, appear by what hath been &s;aid that there is no room to make the &s;uppo&s;ition, as though God might con&s;i&s;tently relinqui&s;h his claim to &s;uch a prerog|ative. For, if the precedent rea&s;oning be just, it is ab|&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential and inalienable. It &s;o belongs to God, that he cannot relinqui&s;h it any more than he can deny him&s;elf; can dimini&s;h his perfection, which would be the &s;ame as to undeify him&s;elf.</P>
<P>WITH this premi&s;ed let us proceed. If it doth not belong to God to determine the character, and a&s;certain the eternal &s;tate of men, the que&s;tion will return. To whom doth it belong?</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place. "Is this to be determined and or|dered by the &s;kill and power of &s;ome created being, or by the united deliberations, the joint con&s;ent of finite intelligencies?"</P>
<P>IT is very weak indeed to imagine this great affair may be determined and ordered by any one created be|ing. Gabriel alone is not &s;ufficient. And there is no room to &s;uppo&s;e the united deliberations of finite intel|ligencies, not tho&s;e of the human kind; Becau&s;e they come into exi&s;tence by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and only a few are a|live on earth at once. And &s;hould the &s;uppo&s;ition only comprehend tho&s;e who are alive on earth at once. It would be impracticable for them to meet together, and unitedly con&s;ult and determine who &s;hould, and who &s;hould not be the objects of &s;aving mercy. Moreover, if they could meet together, and the affair, in re&s;pect to each individual, might i&s;&s;ue, according to the deter|mination in which they &s;hould be united; there is not the &s;hadow of a probability they would unite. Their various &s;elfi&s;h bia&s;es, and de&s;igus would nece&s;&s;arily,
<PB N="34" REF="024750_0032_0FC8652D12F16938">
and effectually prevent an agreement.</P>
<P>IN the next place, "Shall we &s;uppo&s;e it is the pro|vince of the angels to determine and order who of the human race &s;hall be &s;aved, and who &s;hall be left to pe|ri&s;h?" But what angels? The good? Or the bad? Or &s;hall we &s;ay? That the good angels determine how many, and who of the human kind &s;hall be the &s;ubjects of &s;aving mercy. The evil angels how many, and who &s;hall be hardened to their de&s;truction."</P>
<P>IN regard to the evil angels it may be ob&s;erved. That they fain would have all without exception hard|ened and de&s;troyed. And are unwearied in their attempts to accompli&s;h the eternal ruin of mankind. Are repre&s;ented going about as roaring lions &s;eeking whom they may devour. Not for the &s;ake of ju&s;tice, the &s;upport of government, and vindication of the di|vine character; but to gratify their malice, and re|venge.</P>
<P>As to the holy angels&mdash;They would find the affair &s;o awful, &s;o deeply involved, and attended with &s;uch infi|nitely important and eternal con&s;equences, as that they would not dare to attempt it, were it to be propo&s;ed to them, and if they &s;hould attempt, would find them|&s;elves wholly unequal to it.</P>
<P>IN the la&s;t place, "Shall we &s;ay this great affair is left to men them&s;elves? Each one is to determine and a&s;certain his own character and eternal &s;tate?" This indeed is not <HI>morely</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed; but a&s;&s;erted, and <HI>&s;tren|uou&s;ly</HI> in&s;i&s;ted upon by many. It is not as God wills and di&s;po&s;es; but as men them&s;elves will and order. There are who &s;ay, "Men &s;hall be ble&s;t as far as man permits; A nature Rational implies the power Of being ble&s;t or wretched as we plea&s;e. Heaven wills our happine&s;s, allows our doom; Heaven but per&s;uades, Almighty man decrees; Man is the maker of immortal &s;ates."</P>

<P>CONCERNING what is now before us, it may be pro|per to mention &s;everal things, and proceed by &s;teps. Here then.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT may be granted, That it was referred to <HI>Adam</HI> (as far as any &s;uch thing could be referred to a crea|ture) to determine his <HI>own,</HI> and the character and &s;tate of his <HI>po&s;terity.</HI> It is certain, however, that Adam had not that liberty of indifference, that &s;elf-determining power, that power of originating volitions, which is urged by many as being e&s;&s;ential to moral agency; and nece&s;&s;ary to render the volitions and actions of men worthy of prai&s;e, or blame. Becau&s;e &s;uch power and liberty is no where to be found, in men, angels, or the Deity; the very notion being ab&s;urd. Real perfect indifferency in &s;uch a &s;tate of mind as takes away the very idea of will or inclination. And to &s;uppo&s;e a power to choo&s;e without motive, and <HI>even</HI> again&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t motive, or motives, is to &s;uppo&s;e a power to do nothing. For without motive there can be no choice; becau&s;e motive is implied in choo&s;ing. It is in reality to &s;ay, men have a power to choo&s;e without choo&s;ing, without being able to choo&s;e any thing. And if a real indifferency might be &s;uppo&s;ed without ab&s;ur|dity it would be evil&mdash;&s;inful. For there ought to be no indifference, re&s;pecting holine&s;s, in the hearts of moral agents. To return,</P>
<P>IT may be granted; that, in a low qualified &s;en&s;e, it was referred to <HI>Adam</HI> to determine his <HI>own,</HI> and the character and &s;tate of his <HI>po&s;terity.</HI> And we well know the i&s;&s;ue of that trial was &s;in and ruin. As the affair &s;tood at the fir&s;t fail of man: <HI>Adam,</HI> and all the <HI>human race</HI> would have been hardened, to <HI>his,</HI> and <HI>their</HI> eter|nal de&s;truction, if not prevented by a &s;pecial divine in|terpo&s;ition.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE work of redemption by Chri&s;t hath opened the way to prevent the eternal de&s;truction of the hu|man kind. But it is ever to be remembered, that the
<PB N="36" REF="024750_0034_0FC865315ACA5278">
work Chri&s;t fini&s;hed on the Cro&s;s, in it&s;elf con&s;idered, doth make no alteration in the &s;tate of mens minds. The bias of their minds, while unregenerate, is only in favor of &s;in. Certainly it is not in favor of holine&s;s: For then there would be no need of being born again. And our Saviour did not prea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and inculcate the truth when he &s;aid, "Except a man be born again he can|not &s;ee the kingdom of God." Were the deci&s;ion, therefore, to be left to men them&s;elves, as the ca&s;e now &s;tands, they would determine in favor of &s;in, of per&s;evering oppo&s;ition to God; would reject &s;alvati|on, unle&s;s they might be &s;aved in their own way, and on their own terms. And truly, the very mercy&mdash;the &s;alvation it&s;elf, holine&s;s being e&s;&s;ential thereto and as it were the whole thereof, would be rejected on whate|ver terms it might be propo&s;ed. And &s;o the con&s;e|quence would be no &s;alvation: but de&s;truction to the whole race: notwith&s;tanding what Chri&s;t hath done, and &s;uffered to procure redemption.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE way of recovery and &s;alvation by Chri&s;t being revealed, offers made, and calls given to men; Should it be conceded, that &s;ome may po&s;&s;ibly be pre|vailed upon to accept the propo&s;als of the Go&s;pel, without any &s;pecial &s;upernatural influence to change their hearts, and captivate them to the obedience of Chri&s;t: Yet, it mu&s;t be uncertain, whether any would comply. It might turn out &s;o in event, that Chri&s;t &s;hould not &s;ee his &s;eed; not &s;ee of the travail of his &s;oul, and be &s;atisfied; and might have none finally to pre&s;ent to his Father. In a word, his death, as to its &s;a|ving effects, might be wholly fru&s;trated.</P>
<P N="4">4. THIS will lay us under a nece&s;&s;ity of maintaining that God (with awe may it be &s;poken) hath projected a vague plan&mdash;a plan &s;ome of the mo&s;t important parts of which are undetermined&mdash;a plan full of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">certain|ty &mdash;the event of which him&s;elf could not know before hand; although it is &s;aid, "Known unto God are all his works, from the beginning." For, if there is no
<PB N="37" REF="024750_0035_0FC86532593287F0">
certainty who &s;hall, and who &s;hall not be &s;aved, it can|not be known who &s;hall &s;hare the &s;aving effects of divine mercy. Becau&s;e the previous certainty of an event is implied in the knowledge, or foreknowledge of the e|vent. For, to know that an event &s;hall take place when it is uncertain that it will take place, and may never take place, is a contradiction in terms. And it is no limitation of divine knowledge to &s;ay, God can|not know that which is unknowable; any more than it is a limitation of divine power to &s;ay, God cannot do that which is impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;that which implies an ab&s;urd|ity. For, as the latter is not the object of power; &s;o neither is the former the object of knowledge.</P>
<P N="5">5. FROM this view of things it appears to be no ways &s;itting, that the determination of the character, and di&s;|po&s;al of the eternal &s;tate of men &s;hould be left to men them&s;elves; nor to any created beings. And if it were, the utmo&s;t uncertainty and confu&s;ion would be the con|&s;equence. And as God could not know what would be the event of things in the &s;y&s;tem; he might be brought to vary and &s;hift, to alter and amend; &s;o as to accomo|date him&s;elf to the fickle changing humors of creatures. The folly and ab&s;urdity of which doth clearly evince, that it belongs to God to determine the character, and di&s;po&s;e of the eternal &s;tate of men according to his own wi&s;dom, and good plea&s;ure.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="38" REF="024750_0036_0FC8653584C4FE38">6. As without this &s;uppo&s;ition, the &s;y&s;tem of things is a chaos, without any con&s;i&s;tent de&s;ign: So when we admit the idea, He hath determined, and a&s;certained the character, and eternal &s;tate of men according to his wi&s;e and holy will; it appears at once, there is order, connection and effect. JEHOVAH takes, and fills the throne&mdash;acts in character of a glorious independent &s;o|vereign &mdash;hath a plan of operation &s;ettled&mdash;knows what he is about to effect&mdash;can &s;peak of things that are even|tual, as if they were already in event&mdash;has the i&s;&s;ue &s;o determined as to be liable to no di&s;appointment&mdash;his coun&s;el &s;tands, and he doth all his plea&s;ure. Hence,</P>
<P N="7">7. THIS dilemma is unavoidable. Either the Dei|ty hath no will, no plea&s;ure re&s;pecting the &s;alvation, and damnation of the individuals of the human race, or his coun&s;el doth not &s;tand; Unle&s;s it be true that he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and harden|eth whom he will; as fully and definitively as hath been mentioned.</P>
<P>To &s;ay his coun&s;el doth not &s;tand, is not only to de|ny the &s;pirit, and expre&s;s letter of the &s;criptures by a daring contradiction. But is al&s;o to affirm in effect, that "the ble&s;&s;ed and only Potentate" is liable to mutation; is &s;ubjected to caprice, multiplied beyond expre&s;&s;ion; and expo&s;ed to experience and le&s;s di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>ON the other hand; to &s;ay he hath no will, no plea&s;ure re&s;pecting the character and eternal &s;tate of men, is as much as to &s;ay, he is unconcerned in regard to what takes place in this part of the &s;y&s;tem. And we may as well &s;ay he is unconcerned in regard to what takes place in another, and in every other part of the univer&s;al &s;y&s;|tem. Or &s;ay he hath no &s;y&s;tem, no plan of operation. And for any to urge, "That the divine will is conditi|onal. There is nothing definitively fixed in the divine mind re&s;pecting the individuals that &s;hall be &s;aved, and that &s;hall peri&s;h: Only this in general: He is re&s;olved to have mercy on all who repent, and to harden and de&s;troy all tho&s;e who remain impenitent. And this be|ing the &s;um of his will and coun&s;el: he not only hath a will in the matter; but his coun&s;el mu&s;t &s;tand, let it fall as it may with the individuals of the human race." I &s;ay, to urge this will afford no relief. Becau&s;e re|pentance is implied in God's having mercy on any, in the &s;en&s;e of the text; and impenitence continued to the la&s;t is implied in his hardening whom he will. To &s;ay God is determined to have mercy on whom he will, le&s;s or more, on &s;uppo&s;ition they repent; when, at the &s;ame time, his having mercy compri&s;es their repentance on whom he will have mercy. And to &s;ay God is doter|mined to harden whom he will, le&s;s or more, on &s;uppo|&s;ition
<PB N="39" REF="024750_0037_0FC86536C3859C80">
they remain impenitent; when impenitence is what is meant by being hardened, is plainly ab&s;urd&mdash;is, ab&s;olutely, &s;aying nothing to the purpo&s;e. By this it may be &s;een, that there cannot be any conditional de|cree or determination in the divine mind, re&s;pecting his having mercy on &s;ome, and hardening others.</P>
<P N="8">8. THEREFORE on the whole. Since a denial that it belongs to God&mdash;is his e&s;&s;ential prerogative to have mercy on whom he will <HI>have mercy,</HI> and to harden whom he will; is &s;o full of weakne&s;s, and ab&s;urdity. Since there are no other beings to whom it doth or can belong. And &s;ince the admi&s;&s;ion of this &s;ets God upon the throne; &s;ubjecting the materials and the intellectu|al world, to his authority and will. And in fine, leads us to &s;ee how his own, which are the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t ends, may be certainly and infallibly accompli&s;hed. We ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in a clear conviction, and full per&s;ua&s;ion of this great truth: That it belongs to God&mdash;is his e&s;&s;ential prerogative to determine the cha|racter, and di&s;po&s;e of the eternal &s;tate of men; in holi|ne&s;s, and &s;alvation; or in &s;in, and damnation, accord|ing to his own good plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>THE THIRD PART. Containing an&s;wers to ob|jections, and an improvement of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I APPREHEND the following are the mo&s;t con&s;iderable objections any can pretend to advance again&s;t what hath been &s;tated and urged.</P>
<P>OBJ. I. "THE preceeding repre&s;entation mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily be contrary to truth, and is really chargeable with bla&s;phemy: For it makes God the author of &s;in."</P>
<P>ANS.1. IF, by author of &s;in, is meant acting, loving &s;in, or being a &s;inner; to &s;ay God is the author of &s;in would be full of bla&s;phemy. And any &s;cheme any &s;en|timent fairly implying this, ought to be rejected with the greate&s;t abhorrence. What hath been &s;aid upon the &s;ubject implies no &s;uch thing. It is not a&s;&s;erted, that God is the creator of &s;in. It is not &s;aid, he wills &s;in, as de&s;iring it to take place, for its own &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e. And
<PB N="40" REF="024750_0038_0FC865389B42F548">
the divine agency and di&s;po&s;al are not concerned in the event, in any &s;uch &s;en&s;e, as to render the &s;inning crea|ture le&s;s to blame than he would be, &s;hould &s;in take place, without any divine agency and di&s;po&s;al re&s;pecting it.</P>
<P>Now when all the&s;e ideas are removed, &s;hould any in&s;i&s;t that God's hardening whom he will doth make him the author of &s;in; he mu&s;t be the author of it, without any thing criminal being implied, or any denial of his infinite holine&s;s, his ab&s;olute perfection, And con&s;e|quently, without any thing to be faulted, to be object|ed again&s;t with any really colourable pretext.</P>
<P N="2">2. SINCE the phra&s;e, author of &s;in, is odious, and calculated to excite the prejudices of mankind again&s;t any doctrine. It may not be uncharitable to &s;uppo&s;e, there are who &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;t, that the taking place of &s;in, and the damnation of sinners, in con&s;equence of any divine decree and di&s;po&s;al; makes God the author of &s;in, and the ruin of his creatures, on purpo&s;e to pre|judice the minds of men, again&s;t admitting &s;uch doc|trine. And in event, again&s;t what the &s;criptures plainly and unequivocally declare, and <HI>even</HI> urge, as being e&s;|&s;ential in the plan of the divine coun&s;els and works.</P>
<P N="3">3. IF to have &s;in, as an event, comprehended in the divine plan, and &s;uch a di&s;po&s;al of things in the &s;y&s;tem that a certain number &s;hall be hardened in wickedne&s;s, entirely by their own fault, to their eternal de&s;truction, makes God the author of &s;in: Then, that God is the author of &s;in is implied in what hath been &s;tated and de|fended. But, what is there in this to di&s;gu&s;t an inqui|&s;itive, unprejudiced mind? In this ca&s;e, it would be a harmle&s;s, mi&s;applied epithet&mdash;mi&s;applied; becau&s;e the word author is calculated to convey &s;ome other idea, and prejudice the mind again&s;t the doctrine&mdash;yet harm|le&s;s; becau&s;e, in reality, it would not imply the impu|tation of blame, or any thing wrong on God's part.</P>
<P N="4">4. WILL, the objector in&s;i&s;t, "that &s;in in event was not comprehended in the divine plan. And that God
<PB N="41" REF="024750_0039_0FC8654100702308">
meant every way as much as po&s;&s;ible, to guard again&s;t and prevent &s;uch an effect?"</P>
<P>HE may as well &s;ay there was no plan, &amp; there is no divine di&s;po&s;al; and deny there is any &s;uch thing as moral evil in the &s;y&s;tem. But the fact is clear and in|di&s;putable: Sin has taken place, and is con&s;tantly ta|king place in this world. And it is fact that &s;in takes place under the divine government. God, therefore, hath not interpo&s;ed &s;o as to prevent &s;in taking place.</P>
<P>FROM this it follows. Either <HI>fir&s;t.</HI> That God did not de&s;ign effectually to prevent &s;in taking place. Or <HI>&s;econdly.</HI> That he was not able to accompli&s;h his own purpo&s;e. And certainly, it is too much for any to &s;ay he could not po&s;&s;ibly have prevented it. But, if any will in&s;i&s;t that he did de&s;ign to prevent it, and has fail|ed in accompli&s;hing his purpo&s;e. Then it will follow <HI>thirdly.</HI> That he is di&s;appointed. Becau&s;e di&s;appoint|ment con&s;i&s;ts in this very thing, a rational being not reaching, not accompli&s;hing his intention and expecta|tion. Moreover, the di&s;appointment, in this ca&s;e, mu&s;t needs be great, va&s;tly ineffably great. So that, accord|ing to this doctrine the coun&s;el of God, in&s;tead of &s;tan|ding, is broken and de&s;troyed in in&s;tances and ways in|numerable.</P>
<P N="5">5. IT will not avail any thing to &s;ay, "That, al|though &s;in was not comprehended in God's original plan; and it has taken place contrary to his intention and will in every view: Yet, upon the taking place of &s;in, in his un&s;earchable wi&s;dom, he hath devi&s;ed a me|thod to defeat the &s;inner; to vindicate and e&s;tabli&s;h his character and government mo&s;t fully and mo&s;t glori|ou&s;ly; and in the end gain by di&s;appointment, of which &s;in is the occa&s;ion, in the fru&s;tration of his original plan and &s;cheme of things." For this in effect would be a denial of his eternal exi&s;tence, and ab&s;olute per|fection; a denial of his omni&s;cience, omnipotence, and immutability. For, if &s;omething hath taken place which he did not comprehend before, he cannot be
<PB N="42" REF="024750_0040_0FC8654492820598">
"the high and lo&s;ty One that inhabiteth eternity." And if he has changed his original plan he mu&s;t be a metable being; and not that father of lights&mdash;that fountain of knowledge, excellence, power and glory "with whom is no variablene&s;s, neither &s;hadow of turning." This therefore, is a futile impious eva&s;ion; full of athei&s;m and bla&s;phemy.</P>
<P N="6">6. IT is evident that the work of redemption is more glorious than any, than all the other works of God. In the contrivance and execution of which there is the clea|re&s;t and fulle&s;t exhibition of the divine character. Al|&s;o the di&s;play of perfection therein to be made, and the good thereby to be produced, was the ultimate end of creation. Now to deny this was comprehended in the divine plan is to deny, that the mo&s;t illu&s;trious di&s;play of perfection, and that in reference, and &s;ome &s;ort of &s;ub&s;ervience to which all other divine works are done, was comprehended therein. Which is a weakne&s;s, and an ab&s;urdity too gro&s;s to be admitted a &s;ingle moment. But, if the work of redemption was comprehended in the divine plan &s;in was comprehended therein: becau&s;e the work of redemption &s;uppo&s;es, and nece&s;&s;arily im|plies &s;in. For without &s;in there would have been no room, no need of atonement for &s;in. If there had been no &s;inners, lo&s;t peri&s;hing creatures, in the nature of the ca&s;e, there could be no &s;aviour of &s;inners. If God had not been di&s;honored his character could not be vindi|cated by the obedience, and death of Chri&s;t. There would have been no opportunity for the united, and contra&s;ted di&s;play of vindictive ju&s;tice, and redeeming meray. Therefore, by excluding &s;in in event from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> comprehended in the divine plan, we exclude <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. In a word, we mu&s;t turn athei&s;ts; and a|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> what&s;oever takes place to chance, or blind &s;ate; le&s;t by admitting a providence, and fore&s;ight we &s;hould make God the author of &s;in. And when we have done this, all talk of &s;in and moral evil will be vain and fool|i&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="024750_0041_0FC86547735E48A8">OBJ. II. ACCORDING to what hath been advanced "it is nece&s;&s;ary that &s;ome &s;hould be hardened to their de&s;truction. If &s;o, liberty is de&s;troyed; men are <HI>mere</HI> machines; and there can be no rea&s;on to impute guilt and blame to them."</P>
<P N="1">ANS. 1. I THROW &s;everal ideas and different ex|pre&s;&s;ions into this objection; becau&s;e they &s;eem to be united, and will &s;tand or fall together. For, if men are moved and acted like a wind mill, or a watch, there is no liberty&mdash;no moral agency. And if there is no li|berty, and moral agency doubtle&s;s men are not to blame; and there can be no rea&s;on to impute guilt when they commit, what are called, the gro&s;&s;e&s;t crimes. And finally, the doctrine of a natural ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;i|ty and fatality mu&s;t be admitted. But none of the&s;e horrid con&s;equences do follow from this po&s;ition, He hardeneth whom he will. Men are not machines, are not acted like machines when they are hardened in &s;in: For they are voluntary, they move and act of choic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Whereas in a <HI>mere</HI> machine there is no volition, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> acted upon; but doth not act, doth not put forth any exertion. There is then, an e&s;&s;ential difference. A <HI>mere</HI> machine cannot exercise liberty, cannot be to blame; becau&s;e it has no de&s;ign, no volition. But God in hardening &s;inners doth not influence them in a|ny &s;uch manner, as to prevent &s;in being their own act&mdash; or to prevent their actins of choice. And becau&s;e they act voluntarily, re&s;pecting that which is evil and make the evil their own, they are to blame, are whol|ly without excu&s;e. Sinners are not compelled to do wickedly. Whatever extrin&s;ic influence there may be in the production of volition it is not of the nature of compul&s;ion. For we mean by compul&s;ion, that power which effects a thing again&s;t, or at lea&s;t, without our will and con&s;ent. But there is nothing of this. Nei|ther hath it been maintained that God infu&s;eth hardne&s;s into men. There is no nece&s;&s;ity, therefore, of mens' &s;inning at all, and remaining under the power of lu&s;t,
<PB N="44" REF="024750_0042_0FC86548D2B2ED20">
of any &s;uch kind as will exculpate them; as will exte|nuate their &s;in and guilt in the lowe&s;t degree, by taking away their liberty.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE mo&s;t hardened &s;inners are, to all intents, moral agents and accountable; becau&s;e they act freely. And the more hardened they are the other criminal; be|cau&s;e this is no more than voluntarily and freely acting wickedne&s;s to a higher degree.</P>
<P N="3">3. ALTHOUGH there is, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, a nece&s;&s;ity of being hardened when it is &s;aid, "Whom he will he hardeneth" i. e. a nece&s;&s;ity of a moral kind&mdash;a certain|ty: yet this is no &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity as is oppo&s;ed to liber|ty. The greate&s;t certainty or moral nece&s;&s;ity may be con&s;i&s;tent with the highe&s;t liberty. It is nece&s;&s;ary God &s;hould act in a holy manner; yet he acts with the mo&s;t perfect freedom. And there is a certainty that the glo|rified &s;aints will be holy and happy forever; by which their liberty, their moral agency will not be de&s;troyed, or infringed; but confirmed, and exalted.</P>
<P>OBJ. III. "THE &s;entence, Whom he will he harden|eth as it hath been &s;tated, implies a denial of the divine holine&s;s. For the moral law is a tran&s;cript of the divine perfections; di&s;covers the heart&mdash;the will and plea&s;ure of the Deity. He <HI>there</HI> forbids &s;in upon pain of his eternal di&s;plea&s;ure, and repre&s;ents it to be that abominable thing which his &s;oul abhors. But, if &s;in was comprehended in his plan and di&s;po&s;al of things it mu&s;t be agreeable to his mind that &s;in &s;hould take place. And it is fal&s;e to &s;ay, He is of purer eyes than to be|hold iniquity: for he mu&s;t, according to this doctrine, behold it with complacency rather than abhorrence; be|cau&s;e it is hischoice &amp; the con&s;equence of his di&s;po&s;als.</P>
<P N="1">ANS. 1. IF the &s;entiment which has been advanced doth really imply a denial, or any repugnancy to the holine&s;s of the Deity, it ought to be rejected. Cer|tainly God is a holy being, infinitely holy. With the greate&s;t propriety do Seraphim, and Cherubim cry, "Holy, holy, holy <HI>is</HI> the LORD of ho&s;ts." So that
<PB N="45" REF="024750_0043_0FC8654B96399B10">
no &s;entiment that denies God's e&s;&s;ential infinite purity is to be endured 2 moment. Al&s;o, &s;in is diametrically oppo&s;ite to holine&s;s&mdash;is what God mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily hate with perfect dete&s;tation. Evil doth not, cannot dwell with him.</P>
<P N="2">2. THERE is no denial of holine&s;s in &s;aying, God wills the event; or wills not effectually to prevent &s;in taking place, and di&s;po&s;es things &s;o as not effectually to prevent it. Indeed this is &s;o far from implying a deni|al of holine&s;s, that his will and di&s;po&s;al in reference to &s;in is entirely holy&mdash;is done in the exerci&s;e of his infi|nite purity. And his perfect hatred of &s;in it&s;elf is im|plied therein. For,</P>
<P N="3">3. A DISTINCTION is to be made between God's pre|ceptive, and decretive providential will. The Bible teaches us to make &s;uch a di&s;tinction. And it is nece&s;|&s;ary to reconcile what otherwi&s;e might appear to be ir|reconcileable. A di&s;tinction of this kind is evidently implied in what is &s;aid, re&s;pecting the conduct of <HI>Jo|s;eph's</HI> brethren, in &s;elling him to the <HI>I&s;hmaelites</HI>&mdash;In what is &s;aid re&s;pecting the king of <HI>A&s;&s;yria</HI>&mdash;and the part the <HI>Jews</HI> acted in the crucifixion of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Now were &s;in in event as contrary to the decretive and providential, as &s;in it&s;elf is to the preceptive will of God; we may be &s;ure it never would take place, on &s;uppo&s;ition there was no po&s;&s;ibility of preventing it. And to &s;ay there was no po&s;&s;ibility is to limit the di|vine power. But God certainly could prevent it, if no other way, by withholding exi&s;tence. And this he no doubt would do rather than &s;in &s;hould take place, were &s;in in event, as contrary to his providential, as it is to his preceptive will.</P>
<P N="4">4. WHATSOEVER takes place through the &s;y&s;tem from beginning to end, takes place in con&s;i&s;tence with the decretive and providential will of God; but &s;in takes place in perfect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">no&s;ition to his preceptive will. From which it doth not follow, that the decree is in re|pugnance to the command&mdash;it doth not follow, that
<PB N="46" REF="024750_0044_0FC865522B42C4A0">
God's will in the former ca&s;e oppo&s;es his holy will in the latter&mdash;it doth not follow that God hath two wills thwarting each other. Were there a real oppo&s;ition in&s;i&s;ting on the di&s;tinction would run us into the Ma|nichean here&s;y, or what would be as gro&s;s. And would even amount to a denial of divine exi&s;tence. For God is one and ever con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf in all he purpo|&s;eth, faith and doth. Let me add,</P>
<P N="5">5. THERE may be a clear ground for di&s;tinction where there is no oppo&s;ition. Order and harmony im|ply di&s;tinction; but no oppo&s;ition, So that while the exerci&s;e of one and the &s;ame, will of the Deity is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, it is and may appear, <HI>even</HI> to our under&s;tand|ings, perfectly harmonious.</P>
<P>HERE it may be urged. "Sin is in full oppo&s;ition to the preceptive will of God. And it appears that his preceptive will is holy; becau&s;e it forbids, and by for|bidding oppo&s;es &s;in. But the providential will of God, as allowed above, is in favor of &s;in taking place. Now if this doth not imply a contradiction, What doth or can? For, if that <HI>will</HI> which forbids &s;in be <HI>holy,</HI> that <HI>will</HI> which decrees and gives it event mu&s;t be <HI>unholy.</HI>"</P>
<P>REPLY. THERE is no oppo&s;ition. The will of De|ity in both is perfectly holy: For, although God deter|mined not to prevent the taking place of &s;in, and doth di&s;po&s;e things in the &s;y&s;tem &s;o as not effectually to pre|vent it; and the certain con&s;equence of his not pre|venting it is, that &s;in doth take place by the creatures fault: Yet his decretive providential will is not at all in favor of &s;in it&s;elf; doth not imply a di&s;po&s;ition to be plea&s;ed with &s;in or any the lea&s;t approbation of it; but the contrary. Sin is con&s;idered by God, in his de|cree and providence relative to it, as being perfectly e|vil and hateful. And as &s;uch by him to be oppo&s;ed. Perhaps the matter may be rendered more intelligible, and &s;atisfactory to &s;ome, by expre&s;&s;ing it <HI>thus.</HI> The will of Deity, in his decree and di&s;po&s;al of things rela|tive to &s;in, doth not fix upon and cleave to &s;in, as its

<HI>object.</HI> Properly &s;peaking &s;in is not the <HI>object</HI> in view; the <HI>object,</HI> &s;trictly &s;peaking, is that which the mind re&s;ts upon&mdash;that which is <HI>ultimate.</HI> The divine mind doth not terminate on &s;in; but his own <HI>glory,</HI> and the final e&s;tabli&s;hment and reign of <HI>holine&s;s</HI> to be accompli&s;hed, through his overruling wi&s;dom and providence, by oc|ca&s;ion of &s;in taking place. And as the advancement of holine&s;s, and the divine glory were ultimate in his de|creeing &s;in, and in all the di&s;po&s;als of his providence re|latively to it: So his decretive providential will, mu&s;t be perfectly holy, and entirely concordant with his pre|ceptive will.</P>
<P>SHOULD any, hoping to evade, or greatly embarra&s;s this reply, a&s;k, "Why may not God command his crea|tures to &s;in with a view to his own glory, and the ad|vancement of holine&s;s; as well as decree &s;in in event with &s;uch a view? Al&s;o, Why may not creatures com|mit &s;in, they having the &s;ame thing in view, that God is &s;aid to have in decreeing it&mdash;to give him occa&s;ion by their oppo&s;ition eventually to honor him&s;elf, and e|&s;tabli&s;h holine&s;s? And in &s;ine, Why may not &s;inners expre&s;s their good will in &s;inning, as it is in&s;i&s;ted God expre&s;&s;es his good will in permitting &s;in to take place?"</P>
<P>To all that can be urged in any &s;uch line this will be a &s;ufficient rejoinder. That Paul has obviated and re|pelled with indignation a &s;imilar in&s;inuation, as if it were a ju&s;t con&s;equence from the doctrine lie had advanced. See Rom. III. 7.8.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, it is a plain ab&s;urdity, a manife&s;t contra|diction. The ca&s;e &s;tated or &s;uppo&s;ed, in the above queries, de&s;troys it&s;elf. For in &s;inning the <HI>love</HI> of evil is implied: But none can love evil, which nece&s;&s;arily implies the <HI>hatred</HI> of good, an overlion to holine&s;s, with an ultimate view to that <HI>good</HI>&mdash;that <HI>holine&s;s</HI>&mdash; To &s;ay this is an evident contradiction: Whereas in God's de|creeing &s;in, and his di&s;po&s;al of things no <HI>love</HI> of evil is implied; but a perfect <HI>hatred</HI> thereof, &amp; a determination to counteract its bad tendency. &amp; bring good out of evil.

Or thus. Creatures in &s;inning ultimately regard <HI>them|&s;elves.</HI> This e&s;&s;entially belongs to the idea, the true de&s;cription of &s;in.

So that, this doctrine being true, men mu&s;t be brought to renounce dependence on them&s;elves <HI>altogether,</HI> and &s;ubmit to di|vine &s;overeignty.</P>
<P N="2">2. ALL this notwith&s;tanding; the doctrine is &s;o far from being gloomy, and calculated to drive men, par|ticularly awakened &s;inners to de&s;pair, that it is their only proper &s;ource and ground of hope. It is the hinge, on which the door turns from de&s;pair to a ray of hope. For were it not &s;o, that God hath mercy on whom he will have mercy there would be no hope at all. Or whatever expectations might be rai&s;ed, would be no o|ther than deceiving pre&s;umptions. It is mo&s;t falla|cious and prepo&s;terous for &s;inners to think they can, by their doings, confer any obligation upon God, and re|commend them&s;elves as worthy of his regard. The unregenerate do not remove; nor le&s;&s;en their guilt by their exertions. Therefore, if God could, or would not exerci&s;e his &s;aving mercy, unle&s;s by their &s;trivings unregenerate &s;inners &s;hould recommend them&s;elves to his favor; there ab&s;olutely would be no ground of hope; their ca&s;e would be remedile&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly de&s;perate.</P>
<P>BUT &s;ince the way is open for God to have mercy on whom he will have mercy; &s;inners who&s;e minds are exerci&s;ed about their eternal concerns need not de&s;pair. They are in the hand of a holy and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; yet merciful being. God can &s;ave them; it m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">e he will. And
<PB N="56" REF="024750_0054_0FC8657467AF60C8">
although they find that they have &s;inned exceedingly; find them&s;elves ever &s;o guilty, ill and hell-de&s;erving; yet God can, and it may be, he will have mercy upon and &s;ave them. Add to this,</P>
<P N="3">3. IF any are awakened, and &s;olicitou&s;ly inquiring after God and &s;alvation, it is more probable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">at &s;aving mercy is intended for them; than if they were not awa|kened and inquiring. And more probable; than that it is intended for others who are going on carele&s;&s;ly and daringly in ways of impiety. Becau&s;e; before God vi&s;its &s;inners with &s;aving mercy, he is wont to bring them into an exerci&s;ing &s;ituation. And if any continue to give them&s;elves no concern about their &s;ouls, and ob|taining &s;alvation, it is a token of dereliction.</P>
<P N="4">4. THERE is not the lea&s;t ground from the doctrine to &s;ay, If we are to be &s;aved we &s;hall be &s;aved let us live as we may, and whether we take any pains or not. Becau&s;e repentance, faith, and obedience are implied in, or will certainly follow the exerci&s;e of &s;aving mer|cy, whenever it is be&s;towed upon any. And it is pal|pably ab&s;urd to &s;ay, If God purpo&s;eth to have mercy on &s;uch an one he will have mercy upon him, although he &s;hould remain carele&s;s and impenitent, and continue to live in wickedne&s;s to the la&s;t; becau&s;e repentance is compri&s;ed in God's having mercy. For this would be to a&s;&s;ert, and at the &s;ame time deny his having mer|cy, in the &s;en&s;e intended.</P>
<P N="5">5. THAT any may on good ground be per&s;uaded they are the &s;ubjects of &s;aving mercy, they mu&s;t find, mu&s;t experience tho&s;e exerci&s;es and effects, which the Scrip|tures &s;tate, as what will proceed therefrom. Such as humility, faith, &s;elf denial and obedience. They mu&s;t live in the exerci&s;e of the graces, and practice of the vir|tues and duties of Chri&s;tianity. We are to make our calling and election &s;ure by adding to our faith virtue, Knowledge, temperance, patience, godline&s;s, brotherly kindne&s;s and charity.

<P>I. FROM what hath been argued and illu&s;trated in the proceeding di&s;cour&s;e we may learn the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and futility of the objections, commonly advanced, again&s;t the divine decrees. And that decree, in particular, whereby a certain number of mankind were from eter|nity ordained to everla&s;ting life, called the decree of e|lection.</P>
<P>THE doctrine of an eternal decree, in a general view, is di&s;carded by many. Barely to mention an eternal irrevocable decree fires their indignation; and more e|&s;pecially to men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion and in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t upon the decree of elec|tion. If God, according to the coun&s;el of his own will from eternity, did choo&s;e a certain number in Chri&s;t and appoint them to obtain &s;alvation and pa&s;s by the re&s;t; and that number will be &s;aved, and the re&s;t per|i&s;h. Then &s;ay they: "He mu&s;t be a hateful re&s;pecter of per&s;ons, one who exerci&s;es partiality, inju&s;tice and cruelty: Mu&s;t have a de&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o make creatures on pur|po&s;e to damn them, and &s;port with their mi&s;ery and de|&s;truction: Mu&s;t be the author of their &s;in and de&s;truc|tion: Events are unalterably fixed beforehand: and being fixed there can be no liberty in re&s;pect to choo&s;|ing and acting: Men are machines, and ought not to be blamed: The old heatheni&s;h doctrine of fate is palmed upon the Bible: A great part of mankind have no chance for their lives: And, it is as much in vain for men to &s;eek and &s;trive and exert them&s;elves, as it is to attempt to alter immutability it&s;elf. In a word, Men are chai|ned down by an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">trable decree; The divine gov|ernment is an exerci&s;e of the mo&s;t o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ous tyranny: And it is not rea&s;onable, nor po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ible to love a being of &s;uch a character."</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="024750_0056_0FC86581B4A3C8C8">IT is in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> way of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, that &s;uch con&s;e|quences are drawn, and turned into objections again&s;t the divine decree, in general, and that of election, in particular. They are, mo&s;t if not all of them illogical, unfounded, vain and impious. Werethere a real ground for &s;uch objections from any quarter (and mo&s;t certain|ly there is not,) it is evident they are not with the lea&s;t propriety drawn from and pointed again&s;t the divine decree. For if the arrangement and di&s;po&s;al of things in the manner they are actually arranged and di&s;po&s;ed of in the &s;y&s;tem be not faulty, be not really objectiona|ble; a decree to arrange and di&s;po&s;e of them in &s;uch manner can by no means be blame-worthy. If the di|vine providence can be vindicated, in re&s;pect to things taking place, as they do in fact take place, a divine decree preordaining the taking place of things as they do take place, will be vindicated of cour&s;e; for the former is a full unan&s;werable vindication of the latter. Nei|ther can eternal annexed to the decree be any real ob|jection. It is no more contrary to human liberty; no more the exerci&s;e of partiality, inju&s;tice, and tyranny to choo&s;e one, and pa&s;s by another, in a decree from eternity; than to have done it only a thou&s;and years a|go; or <HI>even</HI> a day, an hour, a moment before the event doth actually take place. Be&s;ides, to object to the eter|nity of the decree is, in effect, to object to the eternity of God him&s;elf. What&s;oever he re&s;olved mu&s;t be from eternity; unle&s;s he is a mutable being.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, if men will object, let them point their objections, not again&s;t the decree; but again&s;t facts. Let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fault the &s;y&s;tem; and not the divine determi|nation to produce, and order it as it is produced and or|dered. And evince, that &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem in the final i&s;&s;ue is not a good one&mdash;I &s;ay, in the final i&s;&s;ue. For we are prone to judge by a part, and not the whole, and it is true, we are not able to comprehend the whole; yet the i&s;&s;ue is &s;o &s;tated in the Scriptures, as that we may know in &s;ome good mea&s;ure what it <HI>will be,</HI> and judge

Drive them through; and it may be clearly perceived that they center in this, "The fool hath &s;aid in his heart&mdash;no God."</P>
<P>II. WE may learn the obligation men are under to admit the doctrine which teaches, that God is a &s;ove|reign in the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e, an ab&s;olute &s;overeign.</P>
<P>WHAT I intend by ab&s;olute &s;overeign, and what I ap|prehend has been generally meant is, that God hath an original right and propriety in all things, to di&s;po&s;e of them as he plea&s;es. And in regard to mankind to di&s;po&s;e of them as he plea&s;es. In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing a &s;overeign and acting as an ab&s;olute &s;overeign, were there, implied a di&s;po&s;ition to act blindly, unwi&s;ely, ra&s;hly, and unju&s;tly, it would be altogether improper to call God a &s;overeign; be|cau&s;e it is contrary to infinite perfection that he &s;hould act &s;o, in any in&s;tance. But that God who is infinitely wi&s;e, holy ju&s;t &amp; good, who is the creator of all things, and the high po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of heaven and earth, &s;hould di&s;|po&s;e of all creatures as he plea&s;es, is perfectly fit and &s;uitable. To act as an ab&s;olute &s;overeign is to act in character; and &s;hould he act otherwi&s;e, he would, act beneath him&s;elf, and not like God over all. His &s;ove|reignty is nece&s;&s;ary; and no more to be relinqui&s;hed than his God-head and Lord&s;hip. So that for any to deny this prerogative is, in effect, to deny the divinity.</P>
<P>THEREFORE it is not a mere ceremony, an empty name and title. And it is by no means a matter of but &s;mall moment, whether we allow him this character or not. But the que&s;tion with many will be, how far we are to conceive the &s;overeignty of the divine being doth extend: And particularly whether it belongs to God, as an e&s;&s;ential inalienable prerogative, to deter|mine the character, and di&s;po&s;e of the eternal &s;tate of men according to his own wi&s;dom and good plea&s;ure.
<PB N="60" REF="024750_0058_0FC8658409472710">
<HI>Here</HI> many will admit no &s;uch thing as a divine deter|mination and di&s;po&s;al, except it be merely conditional, in&s;i&s;ting that it is left with men them&s;elves to deter|mine their own character, and fix their own eternal &s;tate. Now to deny God the exerci&s;e of &s;overeignty, in regard to this, is to deny him the exerci&s;e of that glorious prerogative, in one of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious di&s;|plays of it. And it is certain, that he has a&s;&s;erted his &s;overeignty in re&s;pect to this, as fully and unequivocal|ly, as he hath in regard to any point what&s;oever. He faith, "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compa&s;&s;ion on whom I will have com|pa&s;&s;ion. <HI>It is</HI> not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that &s;heweth mercy. Therefore, hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, &amp; whom he will be hardeneth. Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the &s;ame lump to make one ve&s;&s;el unto ho|nor, and another unto di&s;honor! <HI>What</HI> if God willing to &s;hew <HI>his</HI> wrath, and to make his power known, en|dured with much long &s;uffering the ve&s;&s;els of wrath fit|ted to de&s;truction; and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the ve&s;&s;els of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory? And not only the Ho|ly Scriptures, but the dictates of unbia&s;ed rea&s;on al&s;o clearly evince the truth of this great doctrine. To e|&s;tabli&s;h your minds in a conviction and per&s;ua&s;ion of this truth has been one principal de&s;ign of the foregoing di&s;cour&s;e. May I not with propriety, as a deduction therefrom, call for your a&s;&s;ent? And urge that you do not per&s;i&s;t in making oppo&s;ition to the doctrine? For certainly, it is a doctrine of great importance, and not to be oppo&s;ed without extreme hazard. This is a pre|rogative&mdash;a part of the divine glory, which God will not give to another.</P>
<P>III. WE may learn the importance not only of a&s;&s;enting to the doctrine of divine &s;overeignty, but al&s;o, of being cordially reconciled to it.</P>
<P>IT is not &s;ufficient that we a&s;&s;ent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it as true; it is
<PB N="61" REF="024750_0059_0FC8658582704480">
al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary that we con&s;ent to it as right and good. A di&s;tinction is to be made between a&s;&s;ent of mind, and con&s;ent of heart. The rea&s;on and con&s;cience may be convinced, while the heart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oth not approve. Although di&s;ta&s;te, di&s;appro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation of heart hath a tendency to blind, and warp the rea&s;on and con&s;cience, (men be|ing with difficulty made to believe, what they do not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ove &s;hould be true:) Yet light and evidence may be &s;o clear and cogent, as to engage an a&s;&s;ent of the mind. Although they fain would, men may not be able, to gain&s;ay &s;ome di&s;agreeable truths. The hearts of &s;in|ners are oppo&s;ed to an acknowledgment of the ju&s;tice of God, in that &s;entence of his law which is annexed to tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion: Yet conviction may be &s;o powerful as to make it &s;tand clear in their con&s;ciences, that it would be ju&s;t in God to execute the &s;entence upon them. The wicked at the day of judgment will without doubt be fully convinced of the truth and ju&s;tice of that &s;en|tence. "Then every <HI>objecting</HI> mouth <HI>&s;hall</HI> be &s;topped, and all the world &s;hall become guilty before God."</P>
<P>Now as the doctrine is not only true, but al&s;o excee|dingly important, wherein the divine character and ho|nor are very nearly and deeply intere&s;ted and concern|ed, we ought both firmly to believe, and cordially to embrace it. None ought to view them&s;elves as being truly reconciled to God, unle&s;s they are reconciled to his holy &s;overeignty. Or to what is really implied in his &s;overeign authority and uncontrollable dominion. By the influence of in&s;en&s;ible prejudice and mi&s;take &s;ome may po&s;&s;ibly di&s;like the term, and yet heartily ap|prove the thing intended. If any are in this predica|ment, I &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to embrace them with cordi|ality; looking upon them mi&s;taken, and not &s;tubborn. But there is rea&s;on to apprehend that a great, if not the greater part of tho&s;e who object to the doctrine, do it from real di&s;ta&s;te and hatred. They cannot bear the Deity &s;hould be repre&s;ented as cloathed with &s;uch &s;o|vereign authority and power. They choo&s;e to take
<PB N="62" REF="024750_0060_0FC865870C8F7440">
the throne them&s;elves rather than bow and &s;ubmit to him who is, by natural and e&s;&s;ential right, "King of kings and lord of lords." They re&s;ent with acrimony the idea of God's determining the character, and di&s;po|&s;ing of the eternal &s;tate of men as he plea&s;es. They who do thus are the enemies of God.</P>
<P>SHOULD it be urged, "that by this &s;troke, many of the mo&s;t amiable character and engaging behaviour are cut off, and in effect doomed to de&s;truction. Many ci|vil, &s;erious per&s;ons: and con&s;tant in their attendance on divine in&s;titutions; in meditation and prayer, in reading and hearing the word."</P>
<P>To this it may be an&s;wered; that for any to wi&s;h needle&s;&s;ly to cut off, or di&s;turb per&s;ons of &s;uch a de&s;crip|tion would argue a very ba&s;e rancorous di&s;po&s;ition: but if the truth doth cut them off, they mu&s;t be cut off. And it would be the greate&s;t kindne&s;s to make them &s;en|&s;ible, that they mu&s;t be finally cut off and &s;ent to hell, unle&s;s an e&s;&s;ential alteration doth take place in the frame of their minds. It is &s;adly true, that among the civil and externally well behaved, too many do di&s;relish and reject &s;uch doctrine. And it is al&s;o true, that morality, as it is commonly called, never did, and never will &s;ave any man. Let it be valued as highly, as in any con&s;i&s;|tence with rea&s;on and Scripture it can be done; &s;till &s;omething el&s;e, &s;omething farther is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;a|ry. Who more virtuous and well behaved, in the common acceptation of &s;uch words, than the young ru|ler mentioned by the Evangeli&s;ts? Yet he refu&s;ed to ac|cept the &s;elf-denying propo&s;al made to him by our &s;a|viour. All &s;elf-righteous per&s;ons are oppo&s;ed to the &s;overeignty of God; and many of them have a very a|miable exterior: But this doth not render their in&s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion le&s;s criminal or le&s;s dangerous.</P>
<P>SHOULD it be urged on the other hand, "That among the licentious and pro&s;tigate there are to be found, not a few, who will patronize &s;uch doctrine."</P>
<P>IN regard to &s;uch it may be replied; that although
<PB N="63" REF="024750_0061_0FC86589EE336480">
they abu&s;e, they do not prove the doctrine to be un|true; nor to be, in it&s;elf con&s;idered, of a bad tendency. All the doctrines, pertaining to the glorious grace of God in the &s;alvation of men by Chri&s;t, are apt to be abu|&s;ed by &s;inners; but let them turn the grace of God in|to la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, as they may, and many do, the doc|trines &s;tand firm, and un&s;haken notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>IT may and ought to be a&s;&s;erted, in re&s;pect to all, who through real hatred make attempts to evade, and all, who directly oppo&s;e the doctrine of divine &s;ove|reignty, that they are not reconciled to God; are not his true friends; are not in favor with him; but are, in very deed his enemies, and obnoxious to his wrath, how high &s;oever their hopes may be rai&s;ed; and how &s;anguine &s;oever their confidence of obtaining eternal life may be. Men are as far from faith in Chri&s;t, and obtaining &s;alvation as they are from embracing the doc|trine of divine &s;overeignty, in its ju&s;t extent.</P>
<P>IV. WE may infer, that want of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to God's &s;overeignty, and the objections <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> his uncontrollable dominion mu&s;t be owing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> that is criminal, and very wrong.</P>
<P>SOME pretend a high regard to Deity, and concern for the honor of the divine Maje&s;ty; and may be ready to &s;ay, "by all the regard we owe a Deity, and moral governor &s;uch doctrine ought to be rejected." And I am not about to deny their &s;incerity. But that men do not embrace the doctrine mu&s;t be owing to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ruption, their pride, their &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. Many are in&s;en|&s;ible what it is to be creatures; what it is to be &s;inners. That &s;pirit of &s;elf dependence, &s;elf importance, gods half &s;elf-made &s;o much cultivated by mankind is a di&s;|grace to human nature. God will, and ought to be ex|alted: Men are di&s;po&s;ed to exalt them&s;elves. And in this lies a main point of controver&s;y between God and men. Their high thoughts, and rea&s;oning imaginati|ons prevent a compliance with the propo&s;als made to them in the word of God. The&s;e mu&s;t be brought into
<PB N="64" REF="024750_0062_0FC8658E75DD7978">
&s;weet captivity to the obedience of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, el&s;e &s;alvation cannot be obtained.</P>
<P>V. WE may learn what is nece&s;&s;ary to remove ob|jections from the hearts of men, and effect a real recon|ciliation to God.</P>
<P>IT is not to be effected by making men per&s;uaded in the fir&s;t place, that their &s;ins are forgiven; that Chri&s;t died for them in particular; that the divine mercy hath been, or will be directed towards them in di&s;tinction from others; that God hath the &s;ame partial fondne&s;s for them they have for them&s;elves. If is not to be ef|fected by their doing tho&s;e things, the doing of which they tru&s;t, will recommend them to the divine accept|ance and favor. Neither is it to be effected by the pro|po&s;al of arguments and motives, mo&s;t appo&s;ite and weighty, and by the&s;e working upon tho&s;e &s;prings and principles in the unregenerate which are unconnected with real holine&s;s. Their &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s remaining in its full &s;trength will forever prevent a reconciliation, men mu&s;t become meek, humble, benevolent. With &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition they will be led to &s;ee and feel, that "it is every way proper and fit, the government and di&s;po&s;al of all creatures and things &s;hould be, and remain in the hands of infinite wi&s;dom, power and goodne&s;s." All this is to &s;ay, that to effect a real cordial reconciliation men "mu&s;t be born again&mdash;born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of the will of man, BUT OF GOD."</P>
<P>VI. THE &s;ubject pre&s;ents a criterion by which men may try them&s;elves, and come to know what manner of &s;pirit they are of, know their true character and &s;tate.</P>
<P>THE Scriptures draw the line which &s;eparates friends from foes with &s;ufficient clearne&s;s and exactne&s;s. It is true many flatter them&s;elves that they are reconciled to God, who mo&s;t certainly are not. But this &s;eems to be principally owing to their drawing a wrong character of Deity in their minds, which they call God, and becau&s;e they are plea&s;ed with the character they have drawn, and fal&s;ely applied, they imagine they are reconciled to
<PB N="65" REF="024750_0063_0FC86591CF682EF0">
God, and accepted to favor with him. Were we to go through the world, and &s;tate the claims of JEHOVAH; draw his titles properly, and a&s;&s;ert his authority and do|minion, in their fulne&s;s and extent; we &s;hould not find very many doubting and halting. A great, if not the greater part would object and find fault. As we are in regard to reli&s;hing and approving the <HI>true</HI> character of God; &s;o are we in <HI>reality</HI>; &s;o are we in re&s;pect to our <HI>true</HI> character and &s;tate.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, let every of us apply the &s;ubject by a careful examination. Let each one put the que&s;tion to him&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly and clo&s;ely. Am I reconciled to the divine character? to the holy &s;overeignty of God? Doth it &s;eem proper, and fit that he &s;hould have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and harden to their eter|nal de&s;truction whom he will? And do I find my&s;elf wil|ling to &s;ubmit all to his arbitrament without any re&s;er|vation?</P>
<P>"SHOULD any a&s;k, what is intended by All?" I an|&s;wer, Our lives, our circum&s;tances on earth, and the va&s;t concernments of eternity.</P>
<P>AT this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">me may boggle and &s;tart. "What &s;ubmit our eternal concerns to the divine deci&s;ion. Perhaps he will not have mercy upon me, may one and another &s;ay, but pour his vengeance upon my devoted head. Submit to this! I will not. I cannot. It is the &s;ame as being willing to be damned, which none can, no one ought to be."</P>
<P>IF being willing to &s;uffer the damnation of hell is im|plied in a true &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and reconciliation to God; &s;uch willingne&s;s would certainly be right, fit and nece&s;|&s;ary. I have not &s;aid it is implied; neither do I &s;up|po&s;e that it is. To me it is a very uncouth phra&s;e. The damned will be the eternal enemies of God, as well as &s;uffer great torment. Submi&s;&s;ion to divine &s;ov|ereignty cannot imply a willingne&s;&s; to be his eternal e|nemy; becau&s;e it is ab&s;urd. Or thus, The damned do not, and never will cordially &s;ubmit to the &s;overeignty

of God. So that in&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion&mdash;an eternal refu&s;al to &s;ubmit belongs to the character and state of the dam|ned. But it is a contradiction to &s;ay, that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion im|plies in&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, or a willingne&s;s to be eternally oppo|&s;ed to a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. To return. It is nece&s;&s;ary that men &s;ee, feel, and own, that God might ju&s;tly ca&s;t them off, and make them completely mi&s;erable to all eterni|ty. And be of a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;ay, Let all heaven for|ever love, and adore the infinitely glorious Maje&s;ty; although we &s;hould receive our ju&s;t de&s;erts, and peri&s;h forever. Po&s;&s;ibly, &s;ome may come on and &s;ay, "did we know that God had a de&s;ign to exerci&s;e his &s;aving mercy towards us in particular, we would &s;ubmit the deci&s;ion to him." This, as I &s;hould be ready to under|&s;tand them, would be no &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion at all. And yet it is true, that God will exerci&s;e his &s;aving mercy towards all who do cordially &s;ubmit, or rather, cordial &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion and reconciliation implies the actual exerci&s;e of &s;a|ving mercy. If men's uncircumci&s;ed hearts are hum|bled, and they accept the puni&s;hment of their iniquities they need not fear a rejection. At the &s;ame time, it is evident that God's having mercy upon a particular per|&s;on cannot be the idea&mdash;the ground on which he &s;ub|mits and becomes reconciled. Becau&s;e, that God hath or will have mercy upon any one in particular, cannot be known until a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is actually made. To &s;ay that a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is made upon this idea, that God hath or will have mercy, when this cannot be known until an actual &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion hath taken place is a contradicti|on in terms. In true &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion men re&s;olve them|&s;elves into the will of God; and make a &s;urrender to his di&s;po&s;als with no more than this: It may be he will have mercy; and if he doth not he is perfectly ju&s;t and divinely glorious.</P>
<P>LET &s;ecure profane &s;inners, and all &s;elf-righteous per&s;ons be rou&s;ed from their lethargy, and renounce their vain hopes; be awakened to attention, to due con&s;ideration, and unfeigned repentance; before it is

too late. Know for certain that you are in an extreme|ly hazardous &s;ituation; "in the gall of bitterne&s;s, &amp; in the bond of iniquity." And may, for ought you know, be &s;truck dead and &s;ent to hell any day, hour, or mo|ment. And that &s;o long as you remain carele&s;s, or de|pend on your own exertions, there is not the lea&s;t pro&s;|pect you will obtain mercy and &s;alvation.</P>
<P>LET awakened &s;inners be cautioned again&s;t the innu|merable delu&s;ions, to which they are expo&s;ed; again&s;t mi&s;taking convictions of con&s;cience for &s;piritual illumi|nation, and godly &s;orrow; and a forced humiliation for cordial &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. And &s;ee that you do not con|tent your&s;elves with loving God from any &s;elfi&s;h, par|tial con&s;iderations. Be reconciled to God, as God.</P>
<P>AND let penitent believers in Chri&s;t upon whom it hath plea&s;ed God to have mercy, "&s;hew forth the prai|&s;es of him who hath called <HI>them</HI> out of darkne&s;s into his marvellous light, by denying ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts; by living &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and god|ly, in this pre&s;ent world."</P>
