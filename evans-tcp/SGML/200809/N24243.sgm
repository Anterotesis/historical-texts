<P>THE writer of this di&s;cour&s;e is per&s;uaded, that many years ago, when he fir&s;t began the &s;tudy of the Scriptures, and for &s;ome time afterwards, he &s;hould have con&s;idered it as an exceeding great benefit if the&s;e truths had been unfolded to his un|der&s;tanding as he has now declared them. And this is his rea&s;on for making them public; that others may receive that benefit which he &s;hould have &s;o highly e&s;teemed during his great embara&s;&s;ment when he was trying to under&s;tand them.</P>

<Q><BIBL>ACTS, XVIth, 30th and 31&s;t. Ver&s;es.</BIBL>
<P>"Sirs, what mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved? And they &s;aid, believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and thou &s;halt be &s;aved, and thy Hou&s;e."</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE are two ways of Salvation menti|oned in Scripture.</P>
<P>One is. by a perfect uncea&s;ing obedience:</P>
<P>The other is by tru&s;ting in the mercy of God, through Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is called the Covenant of works.</P>
<P>The &s;econd that of Grace or the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is an impracticable way: the &s;econd is po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>If it be a&s;ked why the fir&s;t &s;hould ever be propo&s;ed, &s;eeing it is impracticable, the an&s;wer is, it leads the way to the &s;econd, which is the only po&s;&s;ible way.</P>
<P>The more &s;trict the fir&s;t covenant is the more it leads men to &s;ee that they are &s;inners, and under condemnation; and when they &s;ee them|&s;elves under condemnation, and that they can|not
<PB N="5" REF="032050_0004_0FF107EBD4955538">
come up to the terms of the fir&s;t covenant it leads them to &s;eek for &s;helter under the &s;e|cond.</P>
<P>The terms of the &s;econd covenant are con|tained in the words of the text.&mdash;"Believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t and thou &s;halt be &s;aved." which is a plain and &s;imple condition, and whoever does that, comes up to the &s;tand|ard which the go&s;pel requires; including this in the idea of believing on the Lord. i.e. To believe on him and continue to believe&mdash;to tru&s;t in him and continue to tru&s;t&mdash;for to believe on the Lord is to tru&s;t in him, as when we believe in a man, we tru&s;t in him, in his word or promi&s;e.</P>
<P>As God, in his holy word, is &s;aid to be lov|ing to every man, and his mercy is over all his works, and he will have all men to be &s;aved, and come to the knowledge of the truth, we might &s;uppo&s;e that in &s;ending his go&s;pel for the &s;alvation of men, the terms of it would be made as plain as po&s;&s;ible, and at lea&s;t as plain as the terms of the fir&s;t covenant&mdash;and &s;o they are. Believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is a plain direction. And this is not an arbitrary condition. It is a nece&s;&s;ary one. For by faith the door of in|tercour&s;e is opened between God and our &s;ouls, and divine communications are made thro' faith as the door. God wills our happine&s;s, and in or|der to it wi&s;hes us to be like him, and in propor|tion as we are like him we &s;hall be happy, and in proportion as we are unlike him we &s;hall be mi|&s;erable. Now God is love&mdash;love in his very
<PB N="6" REF="032050_0005_0FF107EE21E3BC48">
e&s;&s;ence&mdash;then according to the degree of our love will be our happine&s;s, and according to our hatred or enmity to him &s;o will be our mi|&s;ery. Now there is no way of attaining to this love, but through a &s;en&s;e of his goodne&s;s, and of his benefits conferred upon us; through a belief in his reconciliation; by con&s;idering him as a friend and not as an enemy; and that is only had through the knowledge of Je&s;us Chri&s;t in the go&s;pel. So that faith in him is not only the condition required on our part but it is al&s;o the door or way, by which all &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, and heavenly tempers and graces de&s;cend into the hearts of all believers, united to Chri&s;t their head, as the branch receives nouri&s;hment from the vine. And as the branch mu&s;t continue in the vine in order to bear fruit, &s;o mu&s;t the members of Chri&s;t continue al&s;o united to him by faith, in order to bring forth fruit to the glory of God, and to the &s;trengthening and confirming their faith.</P>
<P>By this &s;tate of the ca&s;e it is very apparent that no other condition is requi&s;ite. And yet the plain go&s;pel is clouded by a multitude of errors which from time to time have been &s;pread over the minds of men by the great enemy of &s;ouls, as we may well &s;uppo&s;e, when he is the only hindrance to &s;alvation. For we are told that "if our go&s;pel be hid, it is hid to them that are lo&s;t, in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, le&s;t the light of the glorious go&s;pel of Chri&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="032050_0006_0FF107EFB8A58A88">
who is the image of God &s;hould &s;hine unto them:" and that <HI>I. Corinthians,</HI> I. <HI>chap. and</HI> 18<HI>th ver&s;e.</HI> "The preaching of the Cro&s;s is to them that peri&s;h fooli&s;hne&s;s; but unto us which are &s;aved it is the power of God."</P>
<P>Among the many errors, one in particular &s;eems to have prevailed, and prevailed the more becau&s;e it &s;eems plau&s;ible: and it is this&mdash;that if a man believes the &s;criptures; believes that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the &s;on of God, and came into the world as a Savior, and will yield a &s;incere obedience to the moral law, he will be &s;aved.</P>
<P>A zeal to religion though a fal&s;e one &s;eems to have introduced this opinion. The abettors of this &s;ay, that if believing in the Lord or tru&s;ting in him will &s;ave a man, then a man may live as he li&s;t&mdash;there is no hold upon him; he may live as wickedly as he plea&s;es, and yet tru&s;t to be &s;aved at la&s;t. This is a very com|mon, though unfound objection. And it is to be feared that tho&s;e who make it know not what faith in Chri&s;t is. When tho&s;e who are united to him by faith receive from God the Father and through the &s;on as mediator, all &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings; when love, joy, peace, long&s;uffering, gentlene&s;s, goodne&s;s, and all heavenly graces bringing &s;alvation in their train de&s;cend into the heart, will &s;uch a one live wickedly? No. He will have as great a de&s;ire to &s;erve God as ever he had to &s;erve &s;in, "for the love of Chri&s;t con&s;traineth him," and he &s;erves as a &s;on and not as a &s;ervant. For the fear of damnation
<PB N="8" REF="032050_0007_0FF107F1B656ACD0">
never carried any man to Heaven. It may lead him to Repentance. It is the hope of glory which purifies his heart and makes him fit for heaven: and that is to be had through a belief in the promi&s;es, obtained through the know|ledge of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Although a man &s;hould be led a&s;tray by a fal&s;e per&s;ua&s;ion of his &s;afety at the beginning of his faith before he becomes e&s;tabli&s;hed, yet the a&s;&s;ertion is &s;till true that if a man continues to believe on the Lord he will be &s;aved. So that if he receives the whole of the doctrine, that of believing, and continuing to believe, he cannot be injured by it, becau&s;e he cannot tell that he &s;hall continue in the faith till he receives the &s;pirit of adoption, and is &s;ealed with the holy &s;pirit of promi&s;e, as the earne&s;t of his inheri|tance, and then the love of Chri&s;t will con&s;train him to &s;erve God although he was per&s;uaded that there was no hell at all.</P>
<P>Another rea&s;on for this opinion of &s;incere obedience may be this,</P>
<P>The law of God mu&s;t require perfect obedi|ence, every law mu&s;t exact it: and none of us can perform every tittle&mdash;that is &s;uch a complete obedience as is required.</P>
<P>Therefore a relaxation of the law mu&s;t be made, or who can be &s;aved? For which rea&s;on &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed that the Go&s;pel Covenant comes in, like a court of chancery, to mitigate the &s;everities of the rigid law. This is plau&s;ible, but a great mi&s;take.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="032050_0008_0FF107F5AB029308">God intends that we &s;hall be happy by loving him, and therefore to give us heaven not as a matter of debt but as a favor&mdash;by pardoning our multiplied tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions under the fir&s;t co|venant, and &s;o drawing us to love him and be happy; all which is de&s;troyed by this &s;cheme.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. A man who looks to his &s;incere obedi|ence as one of the conditions of &s;alvation is thereby kept from tru&s;ting in the mercy of God, or in the Lord to &s;ave him; becau&s;e he can ne|ver tell whether his obedience is good enough &mdash;a &s;incere obedience cannot be defined: and I never knew an in&s;tance of one who looked to his &s;incere obedience as the ground of his ac|ceptance that knew what was to become of him in the next life&mdash;He was always in a &s;tate of uncertainty. Such will &s;ometimes have a glim|mering hope; but it is like the morning cloud that &s;oon pa&s;&s;eth away.</P>
<P>Some under &s;uch a per&s;ua&s;ion will have a fal&s;e hope when their obedience is very imperfect indeed; and others who&s;e obedience is much better will be troubled with doubts and &s;cruples concerning their &s;tate, and that becau&s;e, having chalked out to them&s;elves a &s;econd condition be&s;ides the one which the go&s;pel covenant re|quires, and not knowing whether they have performed it they cannot tru&s;t in the mercy of God and cannot have true peace of mind from a &s;en&s;e of God's reconciliation; that peace of God, which pa&s;&s;eth all under&s;tanding; nor that love which ca&s;teth out fear.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="032050_0009_0FF107F7B0567F18">So that when men out of zeal want to e&s;ta|bli&s;h the doctrine of &s;incere obedience in order to &s;hut the door of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, they little think by &s;o doing that they actually &s;hut the door of holine&s;s. For holine&s;s is from the Lord; &s;o is love, if it be di&s;tinct from holine&s;s, &s;alvation is a &s;upernatural work, wrought by a divine power in the heart of believers.</P>
<P>It is a mi&s;taken notion in &s;ome to &s;uppo&s;e that a man is &s;aved by being lifted up and carried to a delightful &s;pot. For &s;alvation is in a man's own brea&s;t. The kingdom of God, &s;aid our Lord, is within you: and that kingdom we are told is righteou&s;ne&s;s, peace, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. A man under the per&s;ua&s;ion of &s;incere obedience being part of the go&s;pel covenant, is kept al&s;o in a great mea&s;ure from the benefit he might reap from the fir&s;t covenant which was intended to &s;hew him his utter helple&s;&s;ne&s;s&mdash;that he is under the wrath of God, and mu&s;t peri&s;h unle&s;s he can flee to the mercy of God in Chri&s;t. &mdash;But this benefit is lo&s;t to him becau&s;e he has got a &s;alvo; a mitigation of that &s;evere law that was intended as a &s;choolma&s;ter to bring us to Chri&s;t that we might be ju&s;tified by faith; as the apo&s;tle writes to the Galatians, whom he was trying to bring back to the go&s;pel, and who had been per&s;uaded to depart from it. And &s;uch a man not &s;eeing his danger is not dri|ven to the foot of mercy, and to ca&s;t his &s;oul as it were upon Chri&s;t to be &s;aved by him as the
<PB N="11" REF="032050_0010_0FF107FBA69C1FF0">
only Savior. But the man that thus cometh to him he will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out.</P>
<P>The advocates for this third way of &s;alvation have been called upon to &s;hew in what part of &s;cripture it is contained; and though they are unable to do it; yet they &s;ay it is agreeable to the general tenor of &s;cripture.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t therefore beg leave to quote many pa&s;|&s;ages, that you may judge whether the doctrine of &s;alvation by faith in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is not fully maintained therein, and with this ob|&s;ervation that all the&s;e are po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertions which ought to have more weight than conclu|&s;ions drawn from inferences, e&s;pecially as there is often much fallacy in rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>Then 2dly, I &s;hall from the old te&s;tament &s;hew that tru&s;ting in the Lord amounts to the &s;ame thing as believing on him, becau&s;e the &s;ame ble&s;&s;ings, or as great, are annexed to the one as to the other.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. I &s;hall &s;hew what foundation we have to tru&s;t in the Lord, as every faith or tru&s;t mu&s;t have a foundation.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. Shall add a few &s;hort arguments, and afterwards an&s;wer &s;ome objections and conclude.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ages are as follow:</P>
<P>"He came unto his own, and his own re|ceived him not: but as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the &s;ons of God, even to them that believe on his name." <HI>John I.</HI> 11<HI>th &amp;</HI> 12<HI>th, ver&s;es.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="032050_0011_0FF107FE0C26D700">"As Mo&s;es lifted up the &s;erpent in the wilder|ne&s;s, even &s;o mu&s;t the &s;on of man be lifted up; that who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hould not pe|ri&s;h, but have eternal life."</P>
<P>"For God &s;o loved the world that he gave his only begotten &s;on that who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life. For God &s;ent not his &s;on into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be &s;aved." <HI>John III.</HI> 14.15, 16, 17, <HI>Ver&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>"Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you, he that be|lieveth on me hath everla&s;ting life." <HI>John VI.</HI> 47<HI>th Ver&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>St. Peter when he was &s;ent to Cornelius to tell him words whereby he and his hou&s;e &s;hould be &s;aved, among other things when he was &s;peaking of Chri&s;t, &s;aid the&s;e words, "To him give all the Prophets witne&s;s, that, through his name, who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hall receive remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins." Now we &s;hould con&s;ider what all the prophets give witne&s;s to as the con|current Te&s;timony of Scripture.</P>
<P>"What &s;hall we &s;ay then, that Abraham our father as pertaining to the fle&s;h hath found? For if Abraham were ju&s;tified by works he hath whereof to glory, but not before God, for what &s;aith &s;cripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for Righteou&s;ne&s;s." <HI>Ro|mans</HI> IV, 1, 2, <HI>&amp;</HI> 3<HI>d ver&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>"Therefore being iu&s;tified by faith, we have

peace with God through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t." <HI>Rom. V. &amp;</HI> 1 <HI>v.</HI></P>
<P>"Behold I lay in Sion a &s;tumbling block and rock of offence: and who&s;oever believeth on him &s;hall not be a&s;hamed." <HI>Rom. IX.</HI> 33 <HI>v.</HI></P>
<P>"Moreover brethren, I declare unto you the go&s;pel which I preached unto you, which al&s;o you have received, and wherein ye &s;tand; by which al&s;o ye are &s;aved if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unle&s;s ye have belie|ved in vain." <HI>I Cor.</HI> XV. <HI>&amp;</HI> 1 <HI>&amp;</HI> 2. Here we &s;ee that they would be &s;aved by keeping in mind that go&s;pel which they had received, which con|firms what I before advanced that it is nece&s;&s;ary to continue in the faith that God may thereby work in us that which is plea&s;ing in his fight. It neverthele&s;s &s;till makes faith the condition; and is no objection to its being the only one.</P>
<P>"That we &s;hould be to the prai&s;e of his glory who fir&s;t tru&s;ted in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>In whom ye al&s;o tru&s;ted after that ye heard the word of truth, the go&s;pel of your &s;alvation: in whom al&s;o after that ye believed, ye were &s;ealed with that holy &s;pirit of promi&s;e, which is the earne&s;t of our inheritance."&mdash;<HI>Ephes. I.</HI> 12, 13 <HI>&amp;</HI> 14 <HI>v.</HI></P>
<P>"According to the eternal purpo&s;e which he purpo&s;ed in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord, in whom we have boldne&s;s and acce&s;s with confidence by the faith of him." <HI>Ephes III.</HI> 12 <HI>&amp;</HI> 13 <HI>v.</HI></P>
<P>"I am crucified with Chri&s;t neverthele&s;s I live, yet not I but Chri&s;t liveth in me: and the
<PB N="14" REF="032050_0013_0FF10802AE9F2E40">
life which I now live in the fle&s;h I live by the faith of the &s;on of God, loving and giving him|&s;elf for me." <HI>Galatians II.</HI> 20 <HI>v.</HI></P>
<P>All the hopes we have of heaven are founded upon the promi&s;e made to Abraham; who is called the father of the faithful, and was made by God him&s;elf the father of many nations, be|cau&s;e in him &s;hould all nations of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed. Therefore St. Paul writes to the Gala|tians thus, "Even as Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s. Know ye therefore, that they which are of faith are the children of Abraham and they which be of &s;aith are ble&s;&s;ed with faithful A|braham." He writes al&s;o, "ye are all the chil|dren of God by faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us" And again "becau&s;e ye are &s;ons God hath &s;ent forth the &s;pirit of his &s;on into your hearts crying Ab|ba, Father." When they are united by faith to Chri&s;t their head, they become one with him, they are children of Abraham, and children of God, and if children then heirs. So that the benefits of being fixt, permanent believers in Chri&s;t are inexpre&s;&s;ible&mdash;And yet attempts are continually making to rob men of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, by drawing off their attention from the&s;e things and by various devices hindering their faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. The Phari&s;ees did it of old&mdash;they &s;hut up the kingdom of heaven again&s;t men: They neither went in them&s;elves, neither &s;uffe|red they them that were entering to go in. Our Lord &s;aid, "Wo unto you lawyers: for ye
<PB N="15" REF="032050_0014_0FF10805512C6490">
have taken away the key of knowledge; ye en|tered not in your&s;elves, and them that were en|tering in ye hindered." And this &s;hould be a warning to us all not to hinder the &s;ucce&s;s of the go&s;pel; which a man unde&s;ignedly may yet ignorantly do. God had mercy on St. Paul becau&s;e he did it ignorantly in unbelief: yet it became a great grief to him, perhaps as long as he lived.</P>

<P>I &s;hall forbear any more quotations on this point, the&s;e perhaps being &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h it: and &s;hall proceed to &s;hew from the old te&s;ta|ment that tru&s;ting in the Lord amounts to the &s;ame thing as believing in him: the word tru&s;t being the term commonly u&s;ed in the former, whil&s;t faith or belief is the more general term in the latter, though both are &s;ometimes u&s;ed in the old as well as the new.</P>
<P>I&s;aiah XXVI. 3. "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace who&s;e mind is &s;tayed on thee: be|cau&s;e he tru&s;teth in thee."</P>
<P>Here we &s;ee a man is kept in peace becau&s;e he tru&s;ts in the Lord&mdash;which an&s;wers to St. Paul's &s;aying in the 5th of Romans, "Being ju&s;tified by faith we have peace with God, through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t."</P>
<P><HI>P&s;alm XXXI,</HI> 27. "Be &s;trong and he &s;hall
<PB N="16" REF="032050_0015_0FF10808B0EA7DD0">
e&s;tabli&s;h your heart, all ye that put your tru&s;t in the Lord."</P>
<P><HI>Ps. XXXII.</HI> 11. Great plagues remain for the ungodly; but who putteth his tru&s;t in the Lord mercy embraceth him on every &s;ide."</P>
<P><HI>Ps. XXXIII.</HI> 17, 18. "Behold the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, and upon them that put their tru&s;t in his mercy; to deli|ver their &s;oul from death and to feed them in the time of dearth."</P>
<P><HI>Ps. XXXVII.</HI> 40. "The &s;alvation of the righteous cometh of the Lord, who is al&s;o their &s;trength in time of trouble. And the Lord &s;hall &s;tand by them and &s;ave them; he &s;hall de|liver them from the ungodly, and &s;hall &s;ave them, becau&s;e they put their tru&s;t in him."</P>
<P>Now they who tru&s;t in the Lord are the right|eous&mdash;they come up to the &s;tandard which the &s;econd covenant requires, and therefore the Lord will &s;ave them.</P>
<P>The la&s;t I &s;hall quote on this point is from the CXXV. <HI>Ps.</HI> and 1&s;t ver&s;e&mdash;"They that put their tru&s;t in the Lord &s;hall be as Mount Sion, which may not be removed, but &s;tandeth fa&s;t forever."</P>
<P>By comparing all the&s;e together we find that believing in the Lord is the &s;ame thing as tru&s;t|ing in him.</P>
<P>But not only will &s;alvation from wrath be &s;e|cured to tho&s;e who tru&s;t in him, but deliverance from temporal evils and dangers al&s;o. Whoe|ver can tru&s;t in the Lord will &s;urely be deliver|ed, becau&s;e by tru&s;ting in him they become the
<PB N="17" REF="032050_0016_0FF1080BAD2D4308">
&s;ubjects of the promi&s;es, and his promi&s;es can never fail. Daniel was delivered in this manner from the lion's den. "So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, becau&s;e he believed in his God."</P>
<P N="3">3dly. I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how what founda|tion we have to tru&s;t in the Lord, as every faith or tru&s;t mu&s;t have a foundation.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, it is nece&s;&s;ary to believe the &s;criptures as the word of God; and every man where the go&s;pel is preached, may, by examina|tion have a good ground to believe that the &s;criptures are of divine revelation; and this according to the clear dictates of that rea&s;on with which God originally endued mankind. Then from the &s;criptures he may learn that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the &s;on of God, and from thence have an idea that he is able to &s;ave. Believing that he is able to &s;ave, he may next learn that he is willing to &s;ave all that will receive him as a &s;a|vior. He may learn that Chri&s;t died for all men, and became a propitiation for &s;in, &s;o that God may receive &s;inners without any infringe|ment of his ju&s;tice, becau&s;e a full and &s;ufficient atonement hath been made for their &s;ins. He may further learn that Chri&s;t declared that he came to &s;ave &s;inners&mdash;that he came to &s;ave that that was lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Therefore every man has good ground to &s;ay,</P>
<P>As Chri&s;t died for all men, he died for me
<PB N="18" REF="032050_0017_0FF1080E1AA1AC38">
As Chri&s;t came to &s;ave &s;inners he came to &s;ave me. As he came to &s;ave that that was lo&s;t, he came to &s;ave me. Every man then has a good foundation to tru&s;t in the mercy of God, or to tru&s;t in the Lord for &s;alvation. And this is an|&s;werable to St. Paul's declaration that "Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God."</P>
<P>It is true, faith is the gift of God. So are many other gifts which we know do in &s;ome mea&s;ure depend on our&s;elves; &s;uch as riches, knowledge, and one more general, not fit to be mentioned.</P>
<P>As faith cometh by the word of God it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that he gives faith by en|lightening the mind to under&s;tand his word; by removing the blindne&s;s ca&s;t over the under&s;tan|ding, that a man may di&s;cern the truth; may di&s;cern what is true whether he believes it or not.</P>
<P>Some are earne&s;tly &s;eeking after faith as a gift; and &s;ometimes they think they have it, then again that they are mi&s;taken, making it an un|certain thing. Perhaps they mean God's gracious act of imputing righteou&s;ne&s;s to a man, which is the con&s;equence of faith. "Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteou&s;|ne&s;s. This imputation is a &s;ub&s;equent act howe|ver &s;peedily it may follow. So is peace.&mdash;Be|cau&s;e they believe, and by faith, peace is given: which may &s;olve the di&s;pute, whether it is becau&s;e of faith, or by faith as the means.</P>
<P>Some al&s;o wait for certain good frames and
<PB N="19" REF="032050_0018_0FF10811174E7610">
feelings, before they can venture to tru&s;t on the Lord. This &s;eems to ari&s;e from the opinion that Chri&s;t died only for a certain &s;elect number, and then how can they tru&s;t in him unle&s;s they had &s;ome tokens whereby they might hope to be of that number. But the&s;e frames and feelings are the con&s;equence of faith: if &s;o, and they wait for the&s;e frames before they will tru&s;t, they will probably wait in vain.</P>
<P>What &s;aith the &s;cripture; I&s;aiah, "Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his &s;ervant, that walketh in dark|ne&s;s and hath no light? Let him tru&s;t in the name of the Lord, and &s;tay upon his God." This &s;eems like the way to be enlightened with the light of the living. "Behold all ye that kin|dle a fire, that compa&s;s your&s;elves about with &s;parks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the &s;parks that ye have kindled. This &s;hall ye have of mine hand, ye &s;hall lie down in &s;orrow." <HI>I&s;aiah I.</HI> 10, 11. <HI>v.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this point I cordially agree with &s;ome good divines; that Je&s;us Chri&s;t being generally offered to the world as a &s;avior, all men have alright to lay hold on him as a &s;avior, and to commit them&s;elves to him, ju&s;t as they are, with|out waiting for any qualification in them&s;elves, but to come as &s;inners, and rely upon him. We may &s;uppo&s;e that the publicans and harlots did &s;o in his day, for they entered into the kingdom of heaven before the Phari&s;ees.</P>
<P>The former had nothing to offer, and there+fore
<PB N="20" REF="032050_0019_0FF108135D8AED60">
could more ea&s;ily &s;ee them&s;elves &s;inners, and be more ready to receive mercy and hea|ven as a free gift, than the others who had much merit to plead in their behalf.</P>
<P>All men have then a foundation to receive the Lord as a &s;avior, and to look to him for it, be|cau&s;e being God he is able to &s;ave: as it is written in the XLV. of I&s;aiah, "There is no God el&s;e be&s;ide me; a ju&s;t God, and a &s;avior; there is none be&s;ide me. Look unto me, and be ye &s;aved, all the ends of the earth for I am God; and there is none el&s;e."</P>
<P>This is the &s;um of what I teach&mdash;</P>
<P>Look unto the Lord for &s;alvation and he will &s;ave you. And as all men have a good founda|tion to receive the Lord Je&s;us as a &s;avior, they who reject him will fall under the &s;in of unbe|lief, which they could not incur if he did not come to &s;ave them.</P>
<P N="1">I. John, v. &amp; 10. "He that believeth on the &s;on of God hath the witne&s;s in him&s;elf: he that believeth not God, hath made him a liar, be|cau&s;e he believeth not the record which God gave of his &s;on."</P>
<P N="4">4thly. I am to add a few &s;hort arguments, an&s;wer &s;ome objections, and conclude.</P>
<P N="1">1. John, VI. 28, &amp; 29. The Jews &s;aid to our Lord, in an&s;wer to his telling them to labour for the meat that endureth to everla&s;ting life, "What &s;hall we do, that we might work the works of God? Je&s;us an&s;wered and &s;aid unto them, This
<PB N="21" REF="032050_0020_0FF0D3466820D7A8">
is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath &s;ent."</P>
<P>This declaration of our Lord is a &s;trong ar|gument in &s;upport of what has been advanced.</P>
<P N="2">2. He &s;aid him&s;elf on another occa&s;ion, "all things are po&s;&s;ible to him that believeth." And again, "who&s;oever &s;hall &s;ay unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou ca&s;t into the &s;ea, and &s;hall not doubt in his heart, but &s;hall believe that tho&s;e things which he &s;aith &s;hall come to pa&s;s, he &s;hall have what&s;oever be &s;aith. Therefore I &s;ay unto you what things &s;oever ye de&s;ire when ye pray, believe that ye receive them and ye &s;hall have them."</P>
<P>Now it is not at all more difficult to conceive that a man will go to heaven by believing he &s;hall go there, than to remove a mountain by believing he can do it. But he can believe neither the one nor the other without a good rea&s;on for it. A man at the beginning of his faith does not believe he &s;hall go to heaven; but when the Lord gives him the &s;pirit of adop|tion, and &s;eals him with his &s;pirit as the earne&s;t of his inheritance, he then has a good and &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;on, to believe that he &s;hall inhe|rit. And by the hopes of glory he is made fit for glory. "Beholding as in a gla&s;s the glory of the Lord, (we) are changed into the &s;ame image from glory to glory, even as by the &s;pirit of the Lord." II. Cor. III. 18. And the a|po&s;tle John &s;ays "now we are the &s;ons of God? and it doth not yet appear what we &s;hall be: but
<PB N="22" REF="032050_0021_0FF10818700DD970">
we know that when he &s;hall appear we &s;hall be like him; for we &s;hall &s;ee him as he is." By beholding as in a gla&s;s the glory of the Lord, i. e. as I apprehend it, beholding now by faith, we are changed in &s;ome degree, &s;o as to behold him hereafter without fear, but when the time comes that he &s;hall appear we &s;hall be like him or compleatly changed becau&s;e we &s;hall &s;ee him as he is, i. e. face to face. This I think St Peter alludes to when he &s;ays, "Hope to the end for the &s;alvation that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t." For then &s;aith will be &s;wallowed up in vi&s;ion. "Now we &s;ee through a gla&s;s darkly; but then face to face." So then we may &s;ay, let a man believe that he &s;hall go to heaven and continue to be|lieve it, he will a&s;&s;uredly go there. St. Paul &s;ays the &s;ame thing to the Colo&s;&s;ians "You that were &s;ometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he re|conciled in the body of his fle&s;h thro' death, to pre&s;ent you holy and unblameable and unre|proveable in his fight; if ye continue in the faith grounded and &s;ettled and be not moved away from the hope of the go&s;pel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every crea|ture under heaven; whereof I Paul was made a mini&s;ter." Colos. I. 21, 22, 23.</P>
<P N="3">3. In the LVth chapter of I&s;aiah it is written "Ho, every one that thir&s;teth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye buy wine and milk without money and without
<PB N="23" REF="032050_0022_0FF1081BADBEBD38">
price. Wherefore do ye &s;pend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which &s;atisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your &s;oul delight it&s;elf in fatne&s;s. Incline your ear and come unto me: hear, and your &s;oul &s;hall live: and I will make an everla&s;ting covenant with you, even the &s;ure mercies of David."</P>
<P>This I apprehend is a figurative expo&s;tulation with &s;uch as hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;|ne&s;s, &s;hewing them a &s;horter way to be filled than by labouring and toiling as they do in the painful works of the law, or thinking to attain to righteou&s;ne&s;s by what they can do. As the apo&s;tle writes concerning the Gentiles and Jews. "The Gentiles, &s;aith he, which follow|ed not after righteou&s;ne&s;s have attained to righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, even the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of faith; but I&s;rael, which followed after the law of righteou&s;ne&s;s, hath not attained to the law of righteou&s;ne&s;s. Wherefore? becau&s;e they &s;ought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law: for they &s;tumbled at that &s;tumbling &s;tone." He &s;aid a little before "a &s;hort work will the Lord make upon the earth" And this is a &s;hort work to attain to righteou&s;|ne&s;s by faith, in&s;tead of labouring for that which &s;atisfieth not: and therefore the expo&s;tulation in I&s;aiah about labouring in vain, concludes with this advice. Incline your ear and come unto me, hear and your &s;oul &s;hall live: i. e. hearken diligently to the word of God; get knowledge;
<PB N="24" REF="032050_0023_0FF1081DF9CAA998">
hear the glad tidings of the go&s;pel, and your foul &s;hall live; and the Lord will make an ever|la&s;ting covenant with you; his covenant of peace; the &s;ame that he promi&s;ed to make with the hou&s;e of I&s;rael&mdash;"I will put my laws in their mind, and write them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they &s;hall be to me a people. And they &s;hall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother, &s;aying, know the Lord: for all &s;hall know me from the lea&s;t to the greate&s;t. For I will be mer|ciful to their unrighteou&s;ne&s;s and their &s;ins and iniquities will I remember no more." For when the Lord &s;ends his love into their hearts, this love blots out their &s;ins, and they al&s;o know him according to the promi&s;e; for God is love, and "he that loveth is born of God, and know|eth God." I. John IV. And this is the &s;ame co|venant that is promi&s;ed to the Jews when they &s;hall be gathered out of all lands. "I will make an everla&s;ting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good: but I will put my fear in their hearts that they &s;hall not depart from me."</P>
<P>A promi&s;e is al&s;o made to tho&s;e who continue in the faith that they &s;hall be &s;et free. In John the 8th chap. 31 v. &amp;c. "Then &s;aid Je&s;us to tho&s;e Jews which believed on him, if ye continue in my word, then are ye my di&s;ciples indeed, and ye &s;hall know the truth and the truth &s;hall make you free." It is plain from the following words that he meant a freedom from &s;in, and
<PB N="25" REF="032050_0024_0FF108205BF72630">
this freedom from &s;in is obtained by a deliver|ance from the law: It is not only from the law that we have the knowledge of &s;in; but &s;in has its power from the law. "The &s;trength of &s;in is the law." When a man is delivered from the law he is delivered from the power of &s;in: as the apo&s;tle writes to the Romans. "Sin &s;hall not have dominion over you; for ye are not under the law but under grace." Therefore it is through knowledge that we become delivered and that in our own apprehen&s;ion. We con&s;i|der the law as having nothing to do with us, no more than if a law had never been made, which could have brought us under condemnation; though it remains as a rule of life, that by it we may regulate our conduct &s;o as to plea&s;e God our Father. And by this we &s;ee how the knowledge of the truth can &s;et us free: and St. Paul in a very particular manner attributes that freedom from &s;in which the Roman Con|verts enjoyed, to their having obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered them, or as &s;ome reader it, into the mould of which they were ca&s;t or delivered. When a man is &s;et free from the law he &s;erves God as a &s;on, and not as a &s;ervant, as our Lord &s;aid upon the occa&s;ion, "If the &s;on &s;hall make you free you &s;hall be free indeed."</P>
<P>Again, We may con&s;ider faith as owing to a certain degree of humility. As a proof of this we often &s;ee it follow great convictions for &s;in which humble men much. The jailor, who
<PB N="26" REF="032050_0025_0FF10822B375F728">
&s;pake the words of the text, we may &s;uppo&s;e to be much humbled by the earthquake; and that it di&s;po&s;ed him the more readily to hear the words of St. Paul which brought him to receive bap|ti&s;m, to believe in God and rejoice in him. We find too that charity which is the highe&s;t attainment, believeth all things, hopeth all things, as well as endureth all things.</P>
<P>Add to this, tho&s;e who are &s;trong in faith are &s;aid to give glory to God: and that without faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e him, in&s;omuch that the heavy wrath of God came on I&s;rael becau&s;e they believed not in God and put not their tru&s;t in his help; whereas Enoch by faith was tran&s;lated that he &s;hould not &s;ee death; and all tho&s;e worthies we read of, and of whom the world was not worthy, obtained a good report through faith, though they received not the promi&s;e. From this we judge that faith is no trifling thing; and from all that has been &s;aid to e&s;tabli&s;h this doctrine we may conclude, that to believe in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is the con|dition required under the Go&s;pel Covenant; and that there is no other way, as "there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we mu&s;t be &s;aved." <HI>Acts,</HI> IV. 12 <HI>v.</HI></P>
<P>I am now to an&s;wer &s;ome objections.</P>
<P>Obj. 1&s;t. The maintainers of a &s;incere obedi|ence or the nece&s;&s;ity of works joined to faith to make out the conditions of our acceptance, have in the cour&s;e of time been driven from a former
<PB N="27" REF="032050_0026_0FF1082498ADDF00">
hold which they maintained, and have &s;ince ta|ken &s;helter in another.</P>
<P>They have been made to &s;ee that a man is not ju&s;tified by the deeds of the law. This has been made &s;o evident to them, that they now acknowledge that by faith alone a man is ju&s;ti|fied, and brought into a &s;tate of &s;alvation; but that hereafter he will be ju&s;tified by his works. By this &s;ubterfuge they hope to reconcile St. Paul and St. James&mdash;The former they &s;uppo&s;e &s;peaks of our fir&s;t ju&s;tification, the latter of our &s;econd at the day of judgment. But un|luckily for them, St. Paul almo&s;t con&s;tantly &s;peaks of ju&s;tification by faith in the fight of God&mdash;of that ju&s;tification which we mu&s;t have when we appear before him.</P>
<P>They quite rever&s;e the matter. Abraham was ju&s;tified by works, &s;ays St. Paul, or if he was ju&s;tified by works he hath whereof to glory but not before God. Though he were ju&s;tified here, yet before God, or in his &s;ight, he could not by his obedience, becau&s;e no obedience not ab&s;olutely perfect can &s;tand before the ab&s;olute purity of God.</P>
<P>"By the deeds of the law there &s;hall no fle&s;h be ju&s;tified, in his &s;ight: for by the law is the knowledge of &s;in." <HI>Rom. III.</HI> 20 <HI>v.</HI></P>
<P>In the 3d of <HI>Galatians</HI> the &s;ame apo&s;tle writes, "that no man is ju&s;tified by the law in the &s;ight of God, it is evident, for the ju&s;t &s;hall live by faith." "If there had been a law given which could have given life verily righteou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="28" REF="032050_0027_0FF108266D5C6570">
&s;hould have been by the law. But the &s;cripture hath concluded all under &s;in, that the promi&s;e by faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t might be given to them that believe."</P>
<P>The inheritance was promi&s;ed to Abraham and to his &s;eed&mdash;that is to Chri&s;t, and all that are his. All that are of Faith are the children of Abraham. If they become united to Chri&s;t by faith or Abraham's children by faith, why &s;hould the badge of their &s;on&s;hip be altered? Why &s;hould not the &s;ame faith which con&s;tituted them children continue them &s;uch? To &s;ay that they are now by faith tran&s;lated into the king|dom of Chri&s;t, but that after they are put into the kingdom other terms are impo&s;ed is quite fanciful, for it has no foundation in &s;cripture.</P>
<P>"If the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promi&s;e, but God gave it to Abraham by promi&s;e." What are the children to do? Why like their father to live by the promi&s;es, be per&s;uaded of them and embrace them, and then the promi&s;e will have effect in purifying their hearts, otherwi&s;e not. For the apo&s;tle &s;ays, if they which be of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promi&s;e of none effect. Accord|ing to his rea&s;oning I &s;hould judge that in pro|portion as a man looked to his obedience for his acceptance in the &s;ame proportion would his faith be made void, and the promi&s;e of none effect: and this mu&s;t be the ca&s;e of tho&s;e who look for acceptance on account of their good works at the day of judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="032050_0028_0FF1082969E7EF90">The apo&s;tle &s;ays further, as the law worketh wrath&mdash;"therefore it is of faith, meaning the inheritance, that it might be by grace; to the end the promi&s;e might be &s;ure to all the &s;eed: not to that only which is of the law, but to that al&s;o which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all." The promi&s;e will be &s;ure to all believers both among Jews and Gentiles&mdash; and if the inheritance is fir&s;t promi&s;ed to faith is it not &s;trange that it &s;hould be changed to &s;omething el&s;e; when it is declared that it is of Faith that it might be by grace, and el&s;ewhere to be of grace and not of works le&s;t any man &s;hould boa&s;t&mdash;and el&s;ewhere it is &s;aid that "to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt." Which the Lord will not allow of, becau&s;e he wills men to love him and be happy&mdash;and to love him by receiving Hea|ven as a free gift.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if St. Paul had any idea of a &s;econd ju&s;tification by works, could he have concluded his life with this declaration? "I am now rea|dy to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight I have fini&s;hed my cour&s;e. I have kept the faith. Hence|forth there is laid up for me a crown of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, which the Lord the righteous judge will give me at that day: and not to me only but to all them that love his appearing." He re&s;ts all his hope upon his having kept the faith.</P>
<P>St. Ignatius in his epi&s;tle to the Ephe&s;ians has a very bold expre&s;&s;ion, "my &s;oul be the &s;urely
<PB N="30" REF="032050_0029_0FF1082CCFC0B700">
of all them that tru&s;t in the Cro&s;s," which he could not have u&s;ed if he had thought any other condition nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation.</P>
<P>But the epi&s;tle of St. James is reckoned to afford a &s;trong argument in favor of ju&s;tification by works; at lea&s;t in the day of judgment: which it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider.</P>
<P>St. James a&s;ks, "what doth it profit, my brethren, though a man &s;ay he hath faith, and have not works? can faith &s;ave him?" And a little further he &s;ays&mdash;"Even &s;o faith, if it hath not works is dead, being alone." This is not denied. It is not contended that a faith which doth not produce works will avail any thing.</P>
<P>But the apo&s;tle goes on to declare, that A|braham was ju&s;tified by works when he offered up his &s;on&mdash;and that faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect: And that the &s;cripture was fulfilled which &s;aith, Abraham believed God and it was imputed to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;and adds, "ye &s;ee then how that by works a man is ju&s;tified, and not by faith only."&mdash;And at the end of the chapter ob&s;erves, "as the body without the &s;pirit is dead, &s;o faith without works is dead al&s;o." And this &s;eems to be the conclu&s;ion of his rea&s;oning, that faith without works is dead, which is not denied, it being a living faith producing works which is contended for.</P>
<P>I will not &s;ay that the apo&s;tle meant that the works of Abraham and of Rahab were a ju&s;ti|fication
<PB N="31" REF="032050_0030_0FF1082F19816758">
of their faith in the eyes of men, be|cau&s;e the&s;e were &s;ecret tran&s;actions, but that his meaning was as he &s;ays, that Abraham's faith was made perfect by works, and that his works were a confirmation that he was a believer, be|cau&s;e he thereby fulfilled the &s;cripture which declared him to be one. This is giving faith its due preeminence. Then when he adds, "ye &s;ee then how that by works a man is ju&s;tified; and not by faith only," I &s;uppo&s;e him to mean, con&s;i&s;tently with what he had &s;aid, that as works &s;trengthen faith they tend to our ju&s;tification. This may be illu&s;trated thus. A man being alive is enabled to eat, and eating continues life or enables him to live. So faith being alive produces works, and works keep faith alive. Yet life is the principle by which a man can &s;ee his friend and enjoy his company, not his eating which is only a &s;econdary help. In like manner it is faith which enables a man to &s;ee God with Joy; and his works only &s;trengthen and confirm his faith. For where there is no opportunity of performing good works as in the ca&s;e of the thief on the cro&s;s, there faith without works is &s;ufficient, and makes it evident that faith is the e&s;&s;ential thing, For &s;alvation depends upon a man's being in &s;uch a &s;tate or di&s;po&s;ition, as to be able to bear the glory of God. Faith and love con&s;titute his &s;tate, fir&s;t faith, followed by love, as good works &s;trengthen faith, then they tend to bring as into a &s;tate of ju&s;tification in our own mind,
<PB N="32" REF="032050_0031_0FF108325E2E45C8">
or &s;uch a &s;tate of faith and love as will enable us to &s;tand before God without confu&s;ion, and to love him.</P>
<P>But if a right faith mu&s;t have good works where is the u&s;e of contending in this manner? It is very u&s;eful, and highly proper to clear the truth of tho&s;e difficulties with which it is em|barra&s;&s;ed; becau&s;e a man is naturally di&s;po&s;ed to look to his own endeavors for acceptance; even tho&s;e who know better are prone to it; and every look or thought of that kind tends to make void faith and render the promi&s;e of none effect.</P>
<P>On the other hand when we con&s;ider that nothing we can do will give us any title to &s;al|vation, but that when we have done all we are yet unprofitable &s;ervants, then we &s;hall be more di&s;po&s;ed to humility, tru&s;t in the mercy of God, and rely upon his promi&s;es.</P>
<P>Object. 2. But it is &s;aid, every man &s;hall be rewarded according to his works.</P>
<P>An&s;wer. So they will. Believers will be rewarded in proportion to their works, and unbelievers will be rewarded&mdash;puni&s;hed, in proportion to theirs. "Say ye to the righte|ous it &s;hall be well with him: for they &s;hall eat the fruit of their doings. Wo unto the wicked! it &s;hall be ill with him: for the re|ward of his hands &s;hall be given him." <HI>I&s;aiah III.</HI> 10 &amp; 11 <HI>v.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides, our Lord told the Jews that if they were the children of Abraham they would do
<PB N="33" REF="032050_0032_0FF10835591ED8E0">
the works of Abraham and as this is the ca&s;e that true believers will do the works of Abra|ham, when two qualities appertain to the &s;ame people, the promi&s;es may be made indifferently to either; or ble&s;&s;ings be annexed to both; as where it is &s;aid; "There is no condemnation to them that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who walk not after the fle&s;h but after the &s;pirit." <HI>Rom. VIII.</HI></P>
<P>But again it is &s;aid, that St. Paul writes to Timothy&mdash;"Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, nor tru&s;t in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be rich in good works, rea|dy to di&s;tribute, willing to communicate; lay|ing up in &s;tore a good foundation again&s;t the time to come, that they may lay hold of eternal life." Now as there is no laying hold of eter|nal life but by faith, and it is allowed that good works help us &s;o to do, there is no force in this objection.</P>
<P>That &s;alvation is not granted to good works we may judge al&s;o from this rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Good works are only &s;igns or indications of goodne&s;s. It is goodne&s;s not works which meet with the reward of heaven. Then a man if he have goodne&s;s of heart, or love will be happy without performing any good works if he dies without having an opportunity, which is commonly allowed upon this account; becau&s;e God fore&s;ees what he would do if he had lived, and takes the will for the deed. They who thus
<PB N="34" REF="032050_0033_0FF10837C08A84F0">
argue &s;till go upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that good works will obtain the reward; whereas the truth is, it is the di&s;po&s;ition of heart, and not the outward indications of it that will meet with a reward, and that of cour&s;e, tho commonly ex|pre&s;&s;ed as if done by a &s;pecial donation.</P>
<P>Object. 3. As I have mentioned that Chri&s;t died for all men as a rea&s;on why all men might tru&s;t in him, be&s;ides his being generally offered as a &s;avior, which &s;ome believe who do not allow the former, I mu&s;t an&s;wer an objection to it.</P>
<P>I have been told that St. Augu&s;tine believed that be died for all men till he con&s;idered that faith is the gift of God, which kind of rea&s;oning ought not to be oppo&s;ed to plain declarations of &s;cripture. The chief argument of the objectors I mean is this.</P>
<P>As all men are not &s;aved, Chri&s;t did not die for all men, for if he died for all men, all would be &s;aved.</P>
<P>But in an&s;wer to this it may be ob&s;erved, that the death of Chri&s;t does not of it&s;elf quali|fy any man for &s;alvation, or make him meet for heaven. It does not qualify one of the elect, becau&s;e it makes no alteration in the heart. Salvation is wrought in the heart through a faith in the atonement, and a tru&s;t in God's mercy in con&s;equence of it. Therefore this objection &s;hould not hinder us from yielding to po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertions, which ought not to be bent to preconceived opinions.</P>
<P>St. Paul writes to Timothy, that God "will
<PB N="35" REF="032050_0034_0FF10839D1153AE0">
have all men to be &s;aved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. For there is one media|tor between God and men, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us; who gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all to be te&s;tified in due time." Again St. Peter &s;peaks of fal&s;e teachers who &s;hall privily bring in damnable here&s;ies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon them&s;elves &s;wift de&s;truc|tion." Both the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages are very plain: the one &s;hewing in expre&s;sterms that God is willing that all men &s;hould be &s;aved; and that there is one mediator between God and men, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all" &mdash;the other, that &s;ome will bring upon them|&s;elves &s;wift de&s;truction, denying the Lord that bought them. Now though it &s;hould be &s;aid that a ran&s;om for all does not mean all men, but only all the elect, which &s;eems to be a poor &s;hift, this cannot be applied nor evaded with re|&s;pect to tho&s;e who deny the Lord that bought them, and bring de&s;truction on them&s;elves, un|le&s;s they &s;hould &s;ay that the Lord bought them without dying for them, or that de&s;truction does not hinder their &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Again, Chri&s;t dying for all men does not hinder tho&s;e who reject him as a &s;avior from falling under a &s;in of unbelief. As faith is the condition of the go&s;pel covenant, &s;o unbelief is the peculiar &s;in again&s;t it; and a horrible &s;in it is to make God a liar, in not believing the record which he gave of his &s;on It is therefore, I &s;uppo&s;e, that the "go&s;pel of the kingdom
<PB N="36" REF="032050_0035_0FF1083EC56C6998">
&s;hall be preached in all the world for a witne&s;s to all nations," before the end of the world. St. Peter al&s;o informs us why the go&s;pel was preached to them al&s;o that are dead &mdash;namely that they might be judged according to men in the fle&s;h, but live according to God in the &s;pirit," i. e. that the&s;e departed &s;pirits, might be judged like men living in the fle&s;h, tho' as &s;pirits they are alive like God, who is a &s;pirit. For he had ju&s;t before told us that Chri&s;t after his death preached to the Antede|luvian &s;pirits that lived in the days of Noah; and this is the rea&s;on given for it, that they might be judged like men living in the fle&s;h.</P>
<P>Another rea&s;on why Chri&s;t died for all men is this. All men will be rai&s;ed from the dead by virtue of this atonement. "For as in Adam all die &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive." As they will be rai&s;ed at the la&s;t day whether they believe or not, &s;o did he die for them whether they believe or no, but tho&s;e who believe in his death now may have a good ground to tru&s;t in his mercy, and look for &s;alvation through him; thro' the divine influence flowing from the glory of the Almighty, and communicated from time to time as he &s;hall think fit; whil&s;t his death cannot &s;creen from wrath tho&s;e who believe not in it, becau&s;e God in glory will be a con&s;uming fire to unbelievers, and at the &s;ame time the hope and con&s;olation of I&s;rael.</P>
<P>But we may yet con&s;ider Chri&s;t as a general &s;avior&mdash;that he offered him&s;elf as a general
<PB N="37" REF="032050_0036_0FF108408BB89858">
&s;acrifice for &s;in; that who&s;oever will, may lay hold on him as a propitiation, and look to him for &s;alvation; ju&s;t as if a fountain was opened near a town for general u&s;e, that who&s;oever will may take of the water freely. In this ca&s;e he died as much for one man as another, though his death with re&s;pect to &s;alvation becomes ef|fectual only to &s;uch as apply it to them&s;elves. Still here is good ground for every man, not only to believe the hi&s;torical facts concerning him, but al&s;o to tru&s;t in him. Whereas when his death is con&s;idered only as intended for the elect, I cannot conceive upon what ground any man can believe in him otherwi&s;e than that he came to &s;ave the elect. How then can any man believe in him for &s;alvation? For though faith is the gift of God, yet he tells no man that he is one of the adopted till after he is a believer. "Ye are all the children of God by faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us." and "becau&s;e ye are &s;ons, God hath &s;ent forth the &s;pirit of his &s;on into your hearts, crying Abba, Father." And if "the &s;pirit it&s;elf beareth witne&s;s with our &s;pirit, that we are the children of God," then we are children before we receive that te&s;timo|ny. If no man receives the &s;pirit of adoption till after he is a believer, how can he with pro|priety wait for any &s;uch token before he can venture to tru&s;t in Chri&s;t? or how can he do it unle&s;s he receives him generally as a &s;avior, who died for one man as well as another. It is probably owing to this, that &s;ome get a hope,
<PB N="38" REF="032050_0037_0FF10842596CC618">
from a text of &s;cripture applied to their minds, that they are one of the number for whom Chri&s;t died; which hope they lo&s;e after a while and then they are to &s;eek again for &s;ome other &s;ign.</P>
<P>But Mr. Hervey and his friends place this matter on a much &s;urer footing. They con&s;ider the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t as offered generally as a &s;avior; and as all where the go&s;pel comes are invited to receive him as &s;uch, they all have &s;uf|ficient ground to do &s;o, in&s;omuch that they will be condemned if they do not.</P>
<P>If the go&s;pel is to be preached in all the world as a witne&s;s to all nations, and all tho&s;e, who, having an opportunity of hearing it, re|ject the Lord Je&s;us as a &s;avior, will be condem|ned for rejecting him, this is a proof that he died equally for all. And though none can be|lieve effectually but by the power of God; and though it &s;hould be the ca&s;e, that this power is not exerted but in behalf of a certain number, yet tho&s;e who reject Chri&s;t as a &s;avior will ju&s;tly fall under condemnation, becau&s;e &s;alvation is open to all; and there is no hindrance on the part of the Lord? the hindrance being only owing to Satan, who blinds their under&s;tanding: And their rejecting the go&s;pel is a proof that they are under his power. Therefore the &s;en|tence of condemnation can be as well con&s;idered as coming upon them, as that the Lord &s;hould &s;wear in his wrath, that the Jews &s;hould not enter into his re&s;t becau&s;e they had erred in their hearts and had not known his ways. It
<PB N="39" REF="032050_0038_0FF108443536B9F8">
is for this rea&s;on the go&s;pel will become a wit|ne&s;s again&s;t them. But it could be no witne&s; again&s;t them, if Chri&s;t did not die as well &s;o them as for others,</P>
<P>I &s;hall now conclude with a few exhortations.</P>
<P>As Salvation is a matter of &s;uch great mo|ment it becomes every man to examine him&s;elf whether he be in a good way; therefore according to St. Paul's advice to the Corinthians it would be proper to examine "your&s;elves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own&s;elves; know ye not your own&s;elves how that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is in you, except you be reprobates," or di&s;appro|ved, as rendered by &s;ome? Abiding in the faith is al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary. No time is limited we mu&s;t abide in order to bear fruit. Our Lord &s;aid, "as the Branch cannot bear fruit except it abide in the vine, no more can ye except ye abide in me." For &s;ome believe only for a while and in time of temptation fall away; whil&s;t the word in others is "choked with cares and riches and plea&s;ures of this life, and brings to fruit to perfection. How nece&s;&s;ary is it then to examine your&s;elves whether ye be in the faith. This is to be done by comparing your &s;tate and conduct by the word of God. For every man attentive to &s;alvation may under divine teaching know his &s;tate from the holy &s;criptures. The works of the fle&s;h and the fruit of the &s;pirit are there de&s;cribed. The fruit of the &s;pirit is love, joy, peace, long&s;uffering, gentlene&s;s, goodne&s;s, faith, meekne&s;s, temperance; and all the&s;e are
<PB N="40" REF="032050_0039_0FF108479FB727E8">
the con&s;equence of believing and continuing to believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>To live under a known and habitual in|dulgence in &s;in is without que&s;tion not to be in a good &s;tate. But as &s;ome indulge them&s;elves in fa&s;hionable exce&s;&s;es and think no harm of it, and be in error thro' ignorance, it is proper to remind them, that there are three great ene|mies, the devil, the world, and the fle&s;h, and it is no great matter which a man is en&s;laved to in re&s;pect to &s;alvation, as either will exclude from heaven if per&s;i&s;ted in. If many did not deceive them&s;elves and one another, they ne|ver could conceive that a man could &s;erve God and mammon at the &s;ame time. It is true it depends upon how much the heart is affected by the things of the world. God has given us all things to enjoy in moderation, but when the heart is drawn from him, whether it be by idols of gold or &s;ilver, toys or plea&s;ures it &s;hould be a proof to us that we are not &s;piritually minded, which is called life and peace. Worldly mind|edne&s;s then is al&s;o a bad &s;ign. "Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, and the lu&s;t of the eyes, and the pride of life is not of the Father, but is of the world." I. John. II. 15. &amp; 16. v. Altho' it is not a determinate thing how far a man may be attached to the world with &s;afety, as all men have concerns in it, yet each man
<PB N="41" REF="032050_0040_0FF108492E6BCDE8">
by attention may examine how far his thoughts are weaned from the right object; and &s;o far the injunction will be a rule to examine him&s;elf by. On the other hand we are told that we know we are pa&s;&s;ed from death into life if we love the brethren. This rule is but little attended to, becau&s;e few think much of the profe&s;&s;ed fol|lowers of Chri&s;t, becau&s;e of prejudices on ac|count of the walk of &s;ome who make &s;uch pro|fe&s;&s;ion. Many do not con&s;ider that &s;ome only believe for a while, and the faults of others are enlarged upon they being more narrowly watch|ed by their neighbours, who have been awaken|ed in &s;ome mea&s;ure by their conver&s;ions, and are rather glad of an excu&s;e to trouble them&s;elves no more about &s;uch things but to go on in the old way of being &s;aved if they are as good as others.</P>
<P>A di&s;po&s;ition to prayer is al&s;o a &s;ign of being in the faith; heavenly mindedne&s;s and prayer being great indications of &s;piritual life.</P>
<P>Fatherly cha&s;ti&s;ements for your faults is an|other mark, "for whom the Lord loveth he cha&s;teneth, and &s;courgeth every &s;on whom he re|ceiveth." And if you are &s;ons and have any ex|perience in religion you will very &s;en&s;ibly feel the force of this truth.</P>
<P>And if you have abided, you will preceive the fruts of the &s;pirit, producing a conduct an|&s;werable to them.</P>
<P>But if after examination you find that you have no well grounded tru&s;t in the Lord, and
<PB N="42" REF="032050_0041_0FF1084BE00C6438">
no fruits an&s;werable to it, you &s;hould try, by humiliation and prayer, and diligent applicati|on to get your mind informed and get that knowledge which will enable you to ca&s;t your whole dependance upon that almighty Savior who came down from heaven for us men and for our &s;alvation. And when you tru&s;t in the Lord you will come to &s;ee, becau&s;e the Lord will teach you, if ye continue long enough to learn, that you have nothing to do with the law but as a rule of life, whereby you will be judg|ed and cha&s;tened as &s;ons, that you may not be condemned with the world. You will know what it is to be alive unto God, and will expe|rience the truth of that &s;aying in the P&s;alms, "I will run in the way of thy comandments when thou ha&s;t &s;et my heart at liberty."</P>
<P>On the contrary, if you fall back to the law, by not taking heed to the things which you have heard, and by not continuing in the doctrine of Chri&s;t, you will find deadne&s;s in all your do|ings,&mdash;that you "build again the things which you de&s;troyed, and make your&s;elf a tran&s;gre&s;|&s;or, (Galatians) and that Chri&s;t will profit you nothing becau&s;e you are fallen from grace."</P>
<P>May the Lord give you a right under&s;tand|ing in all things!</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS ON MR. LOCKE'S <HI>Paraphra&s;e &amp; Notes.</HI> ON ST. PAUL'S EPISTLES.</HEAD>
<P>MR. LOCKE does not &s;eem fully to ex|pre&s;s St. Paul's meaning in &s;ome material points. For in many places where there is a &s;eeming incon&s;i&s;tency in the apo&s;tle, there is al&s;o an appearance of the like incon&s;i&s;tency in Mr. Locke. This is ob&s;ervable with regard to the great point which has been much canva&s;&s;ed in the world&mdash;whether our &s;alvation is to be obtained by works or by faith. Therefore al|though the expo&s;ition in each place &s;hould ap|pear ju&s;t, yet if the &s;eeming incon&s;i&s;tency is not removed, the enquirer after truth is not &s;atisfied with it, nor can he be in &s;uch ca&s;e, as long as he is per&s;uaded that there is no real, but only an apparent incon&s;i&s;tency in the di|vine writings.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="032050_0043_0FF1085209B96CF8">Mr. Locke in his paraphra&s;e on the III. chap|ter of the Galatians, has the&s;e words&mdash;"As A|braham believed in God, and it was accounted to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s; &s;o know ye that tho&s;e who are of faith, i. e. who rely upon God and his promi&s;es of grace and not upon their own per|formances, they are the children of Abraham who &s;hall inherit." And in his notes upon the &s;ame chapter he &s;ays, that the ble&s;&s;ing&mdash;ju&s;tifi|cation&mdash;righteou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;life&mdash;inheritance&mdash;be|ing the children of God, therein mentioned, are in effect all the &s;ame thing on one &s;ide; and the cur&s;e, v. 13th. the direct contrary on the other &s;ide; and al&s;o that the ble&s;&s;ing promi|&s;ed to Abraham and his &s;eed was wholly upon the account of faith. Indeed this point he is &s;o clear in, that there can be no doubt of his opinion about it: for he does not &s;uppo&s;e with &s;ome, that the apo&s;tle meant only the Jewi&s;h law, when he &s;aid by the deeds thereof there &s;hould no fle&s;h be ju&s;tified; but that his mean|ing was, that men could be ju&s;tified by no law whatever&mdash;becau&s;e every one failing of an ex|act conformity of his actions to the immutable rectitude of the eternal rule of right, will be found unrighteous. Again, upon Ephe&s;ians, he &s;ays, "The apo&s;tle gives &s;uch a draught as in every part of it &s;hews, that in the Kingdom of Chri&s;t they are &s;et far above the Mo&s;aical rites, and enjoy the &s;piritual and incomprehen&s;ible benefits of it, not by the tenure of a few out|ward ceremonies, but by their faith alone in
<PB N="47" REF="032050_0044_0FF108556ED8A530">
Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to whom they are united, and of whom they are members."</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e and &s;uch like expre&s;|&s;ions, &s;ignifying that it is by faith and not by works of any kind that we are ju&s;tified; yet in other places he a&s;&s;erts, and that as the apo&s;|tle's meaning, that it is faith and a &s;incere o|bedience joined that will procure us everla&s;ting life. For in&s;tance on the 7th of Romans, &s;peaking of tho&s;e under the law, he &s;ays "their endeavors after obedience delivered them not from that death which their bodies or carnal appetites running them into tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions brought upon them. That deliverance was to be had from grace, by which tho&s;e putting them&s;elves from under the law into the go&s;pel &s;tate were accepted, if with the bent of their minds they &s;incerely endeavoured to &s;erve and obey the law of God, though &s;ometimes thro' the frailty of the fle&s;h they fell into &s;in." A|gain, "Converts to chri&s;tianity are free from condemnation, if they perform what is requi|red of them."</P>
<P>Now in order to reconcile the&s;e contradicti|ons, he &s;uppo&s;es, that a man before he is brought into a &s;tate of grace, is in a &s;tate of death: that he is then as in&s;en&s;ible to &s;piritual things, as a dead man, and that he can do no|thing to recover him&s;elf&mdash;that his being re&s;to|red is altogether of grace, and that it is by faith alone;&mdash;But when a man is re&s;tored to a &s;tate of grace, or life, or &s;alvation, which are
<PB N="48" REF="032050_0045_0FF10856FA2EFD30">
&s;aid to &s;ignify one and the &s;ame thing, then in order to obtain eternal life hereafter or the King|dom of Heaven, he mu&s;t yield a &s;incere obedi|ence, which the following quotations may &s;erve to evince.</P>
<P>"It is the favor of God alone through Je&s;us Chri&s;t that delivers frail man from death. Tho&s;e under grace obtain life upon &s;incere intentions and endeavors after obedience, and tho&s;e en|deavors a man may attain to in this &s;tate of frailty. But good intentions and &s;incere en|deavors are of no behoof again&s;t death to tho&s;e under the law, which requires compleat and perfect obedience, but gives no ability to attain it. And &s;o it is grace alone through Je&s;us Chri&s;t that aceepting what frail man can do, de|livers from the body of death." Again, "The&s;e two con&s;iderations of the kingdom of heaven &s;ome men have confounded and made one; &s;o that a man being brought into the fir&s;t of the&s;e wholly by grace without works, &s;aith being all that was required to in&s;tate a man in it, they have concluded that for the attaining eternal life, or the kingdom of God in the world to come, faith alone and not good works are re|quired, contrary to expre&s;s words of &s;crip|ture, and the whole tenor of the go&s;pel: But yet not being admitted into that &s;tate of eter|nal life for our good works, it is by grace here too that we are &s;aved, our righteou&s;ne&s;s after all being imperfect, and we by our &s;ins liable to condemnation and death: But it is by grace
<PB N="49" REF="032050_0046_0FF1085A39A14008">
we are made partakers of both the&s;e kingdoms; it is only into the kingdom of God in this world we are admitted by faith alone without works, but for our admittance into the other, both faith and obedience, in a &s;incere endeavor to perform tho&s;e duties, all tho&s;e good works; which are incumbent on us, and come in our way to be performed by us from the time of our believing till our death."</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;hew Mr. Locke's opinion very clearly, and the ideas he had of this matter; but whe|ther they are an&s;werable to what the apo&s;tle had on this &s;ubject may be much di&s;puted.</P>
<P>If ble&s;&s;ing, ju&s;tification, righteou&s;ne&s;s, life, inheritance mean the &s;ame thing, and mean as he &s;ays, the thing promi&s;ed to Abraham and his &s;eed, &s;ometimes called ble&s;&s;ing, &s;ometimes inheritance &amp;c. and a man partakes of this pro|mi&s;e &s;olely by faith without works, then accor|ding to his idea of the two &s;tates, the being admitted into the fir&s;t &s;tate was all that the Apo&s;|tle meant by receiving the ble&s;&s;ing and partak|ing of the inheritance promi&s;ed to Abraham. It was only an admi&s;&s;ion into an ea&s;ier covenant, &s;uch as Beveridge compares to a court of Chan|cery with re&s;pect to a court of Common law. So that the matter as far as it re&s;pects Mr. Locke's argument will depend upon what this inheritance is; for if it means only that &s;piritu|al &s;tate of grace, which believers are now pla|ced in as preparatory to the kingdom of hea|ven, all the arguments drawn from the expre&s;|&s;ions about ju&s;tification by faith, are of no
<PB N="50" REF="032050_0047_0FF1085D3AC764D0">
force when applied to the &s;tate of glory hereaf|ter.</P>
<P>With deference to the opinion of that great man, I would &s;uppo&s;e, that the kingdom of Chri&s;t was begun in this world and continued on to the other: and that obtaining an inheri|tance in him was being tran&s;lated into his king|dom; that as chri&s;tians are now ble&s;&s;ed with all &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings in heavenly places in Chri&s;t, they in him receive the ble&s;&s;ing promi&s;ed to Abraham, In thy &s;eed &s;hall all nations of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed: that when they are now rai&s;ed up and made to &s;it together in heavenly places in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, they are created in him unto good works; and that being joined to him in one &s;pirit they are in&s;tated in this inheritance, as the &s;ealing of the holy &s;pirit is the earne&s;t thereof; and that men in this world are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of eternal life, and pa&s;s from death unto life, according to our Savior's words.</P>
<P>So far this &s;eems to be St. Paul's meaning with re&s;pect to the inheritance; but not that they were different kingdoms, the admi&s;&s;ion into which was upon different terms: for all who &s;hall be found of this kingdom will meet with the happine&s;s annexed to it hereafter.</P>
<P>Can we &s;uppo&s;e that Abraham when he was ju&s;tified was admitted into an ea&s;ier covenant, that required a le&s;s perfect obedience than he was in before? and if we do not &s;uppo&s;e it with re&s;pect to him why &s;hould we in re&s;pect to his offspring? God gave him the inheritance by promi&s;e: and he and his &s;eed are the heirs to
<PB N="51" REF="032050_0048_0FF1085F74130A18">
it. He was made the father of all that believe, "And all that are of faith are the children of Abraham. Here is one and the &s;ame inhe|ritance promi&s;ed to Abraham, and to his &s;eed, then all that is nece&s;&s;ary in order to become heirs to it, is to become children of Abraham; and whatever the term believer may &s;ignify, believers undoubtedly are the true heirs. For which rea&s;on we &s;hould &s;tick by this truth, and make it a rule when we get upon &s;ure ground there to keep footing: otherwi&s;e &s;ome &s;eeming|ly contrary &s;cripture will in&s;en&s;ibly pu&s;h us from it. This has been often ob&s;erved. Therefore let <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> adhere to this truth that believers are the true heirs to the inheritance promi&s;ed unto A|braham.</P>
<P>But an admi&s;&s;ion into this kingdom is not only by faith, but the privileges, as well as the future benefits annexed to it, are al&s;o deri|ved from faith. The &s;ame apo&s;tle writes thus to the Colo&s;&s;ians, You that were &s;ometimes alienated, and enemies in your minds by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his fle&s;h through death, to pre&s;ent you holy, and unblameable, and unreproveable in his light; if ye continue in the faith grounded and &s;ettled and be not moved away from the hope of the go&s;pel, which ye have heard &amp;c." In like manner he &s;ays to the Hebrews, "we are made partakers of Chri&s;t if we hold fa&s;t the beginning of our confidence, &s;tedfa&s;t unto the end." If believers are now tran&s;lated into the kingdom of Chri&s;t, and if they conti|nue
<PB N="52" REF="032050_0049_0FF10861C8878860">
in the faith, will be pre&s;ented holy, and unblameable and unreproveable. It &s;hows that it is either one and the &s;ame kingdom, or that the terms or way of admi&s;&s;ion are the &s;ame, i.e. by becoming and remaining believers.</P>
<P>But to proceed&mdash;Mr. Locke in one of his notes on the 2d of Romans &s;ays, "we &s;ee by the doctrine of St. Paul and the new te&s;tament, there is one and the &s;ame rule of rectitude &s;et to the actions of all mankind, Jews, Gentiles, and Chri&s;tians, and that failing of a compleat obedience to it in every tittle, makes a man unrighteous, the con&s;equence whereof is death." Again, "Every one failing of an exact confor|mity of his actions to the immutable rectitude of that eternal rule of right, will be found un|righteous, and &s;o incur the penalty of that law." And yet he &s;uppo&s;es, that God di&s;pen&s;es with the exact performance of this eternal rule; and that he accepts of a le&s;s perfect obedience as more &s;uitable to the frailty of men: and that the merits of Chri&s;t are the foundation of this change, &s;o that tho&s;e who came under this mild|er covenant by faith, are not under the law, but under grace. This I judge to be his mean|ing. But we no where find that God accepts of a le&s;s perfect obedience. He may pardon &s;in, and yet require compleat obedience; an immutable eternal rule mu&s;t forever remain unchangeable. Chri&s;t died to pay the penalty of this law, of this eternal law, but not that the rigor of it &s;hould be abated afterwards. It does not &s;eem con&s;i&s;tent with the wi&s;dom of
<PB N="53" REF="032050_0050_0FF1086362C69A68">
God's government that an obedience to him &s;hould in any in&s;tance be di&s;pen&s;ed with. As governor of the univer&s;e he has a right to com|pleat obedience, and cannot con&s;i&s;tently with that order nece&s;&s;ary to be pre&s;erved admit of deviations from it: neither can we conceive how any line can be drawn to di&s;tingui&s;h how far the&s;e deviations may be allowed, &s;o as to &s;atis|fy the creature: For though God may define it, yet man cannot, and therefore he mu&s;t be uncertain of his fate. But we can conceive how God can be reconciled to men con&s;i&s;tently with his ju&s;tice. When a perfect atonement has been made for &s;in&punc; we readily &s;ee how the penalty of the law has been paid, &amp; how our offended crea|tor can love us freely. Then there is no occa|&s;ion for introducing this doctrine of &s;incere obedience. For &s;inners being, rein&s;tated by faith, whenever they tran&s;gre&s;s there is the &s;ame atonement to fly to: Chri&s;t is &s;till the propitiato|ry, or mercy &s;eat; by faith in whom they can be healed as well as they could at fir&s;t be re&s;to|red. So that this eternal rule of right may &s;till remain as inflexible as ever in its demands. If a &s;incere obedience is believed as acceptable, it is likely to cau&s;e men either to be in doubt of their &s;tate; or el&s;e to think they are good e|nough, and &s;o keep them from looking to the mercy &s;eat of Chri&s;t. Whereas he who con&s;i|ders not his &s;incere obedience, but what the law requires, will be more apt to look to the mercy of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and by &s;o doing to yield a more perfect obedience.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="032050_0051_0FF108663948D738">This doctrine of being accepted by thus en|deavouring to plea&s;e God, is no where plainly declared in &s;cripture. It is only from deductions taken up. Then we will next con&s;ider the VIth chapter of Romans, from whence it would &s;eem that Mr. Locke was induced to embrace it, in order to reconcile the doctrine there with what he had &s;o &s;trongly enforced of ju&s;tification by faith alone; for his comments are otherwi&s;e &s;eemingly irreconcileable.</P>
<P>The &s;cope of this chapter &s;eems to be this; to &s;how to the di&s;ciples the con&s;equence that would follow their yielding them&s;elves to the &s;ervice of &s;in; namely that it would produce death. He had ju&s;t before &s;aid that the law entered that &s;in might abound, but where &s;in abounded grace did much more abound; therefore le&s;t any &s;hould &s;ay, &s;hall we &s;in then that Grace may abound, he a&s;ks, how &s;hall we that are dead to &s;in live any lon|ger therein? he &s;hews, that they were delivered from the &s;ervice of &s;in. He con&s;iders &s;in as a ma&s;ter to whom they had been &s;ubject&mdash;and ob&s;erves that they were now delivered from that &s;ubjection&mdash;and that &s;in &s;hould not have dominion over them, becau&s;e they were not under the law but under grace. Yet from what he &s;ays it may be inferred that they might re|turn to the &s;ervice of their old ma&s;ter; there|fore he warne them again&s;t it, and tells them not to yield to &s;in, but unto God as tho&s;e that are alive from the dead; and that if they do yield to &s;in the wages he will give them is death; but that the gift of God is eternal life through
<PB N="55" REF="032050_0052_0FF1086926AEADF0">
Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord. This &s;eems to be nearly the &s;ub&s;tance of the chapter. Now Mr. Locke &s;eems to give this interpretation to the pa&s;&s;age about &s;in not having dominion over them&mdash; "If their obedience were to &s;in, they were va&s;&s;als of &s;in, and would certainly receive the wages of that ma&s;ter, which was nothing but death: But if they obeyed righteou&s;ne&s;s, i. e. &s;incerely endeavored after righteousne&s;s, though they did not attain it, <HI>&s;in &s;hould not have do|minion over them by death.</HI> i. e. <HI>&s;hould not bring death upon them:</HI> Becau&s;e they were not under the law which condemned them to death for eve|ry tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; but under grace, which by faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t ju&s;tified them to eternal life from their many tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions." Again in his note on the 14th ver&s;e. "The force of St. Paul's rea&s;oning here &s;tands thus: You are obliged by your taking on you the profe&s;&s;ion of the go&s;pel, not to be any longer &s;laves and va&s;&s;als to &s;in, nor to be under the &s;way of your carnal lu&s;ts, but to yield your&s;elves up to God to be his &s;ervants in a con&s;tant and &s;incere purpo&s;e and endeavor of obeying him in all things; this if you do, &s;in &s;hall not be able to procure your death; for you Gentiles are not under the law which condemns to death for every the lea&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, though it be but a &s;lip of infir|mity; but by your bapti&s;m are entered into the covenant of grace, and being under grace, God will accept of your &s;incere endeavors in the place of exact obedience; and give you eternal life through Je&s;us Chri&s;t;
<PB N="56" REF="032050_0053_0FF1086C76617A70">
but if you, by a willing obedience to your lu&s;ts, make your&s;elves va&s;&s;als to &s;in, &s;in, as the Lord and ma&s;ter to whom you belong, will pay you <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ith death, the only wages that &s;in pays."</P>
<P>From hence we &s;ee Mr. Locke is of opinion, that &s;in not having dominion, over them means, that &s;in &s;hould not bring death upon them, be|cau&s;e every tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion under grace was not puni&s;hed with death, but under the law it was. But it does not appear, that the being delivered from the dominion of &s;in meant their deliver|ance from death the con&s;equence of &s;in, but their deliverance from their ma&s;ter &s;in who gave death only as his wages. He repents it again and again, that the wages of &s;in is death, and yet a&s;&s;erts that &s;in not having dominion over them means, that &s;in &s;hall not procure their death as they yield to him in a few in&s;tances only, and do not give them&s;elves up entirely to his &s;way. But the meaning I think is, that when they were under grace and not under the law, &s;in lo&s;es it's &s;trength, becau&s;e "the &s;trength of &s;in is the law," and if they were delivered from the law and no longer under it, &s;in lo&s;es it's force, and con&s;equently has no more dominion over them; which it would have if they returned again to the law. Therefore the apo&s;tle in this chapter attributes their deli|verance to their having obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which he had delivered them; or into the mould of which they had been delivered or ca&s;t, i. e. The doctrine of the go&s;pel which he taught them they had re|ceived,
<PB N="57" REF="032050_0054_0FF1086E1C721EA8">
and it ca&s;t them into that form of thought which overpowered &s;in, and made them alive for the &s;ervice of God. In the &s;ame man|ner he tells the Galatians, that if they walked in the &s;pirit, they &s;hould not fulfil the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h"&mdash;for this is being freed from the do|minion of &s;in. But it is &s;aid, "If ye live af|ter the fle&s;h ye &s;hall die, but if ye through the &s;pirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye &s;hall live." And this &s;eems to imply that life will be given to tho&s;e that obey. But if we reflect a little we &s;hall not find that to be the ca&s;e; but that the meaning is, that if they mortify the deeds of the body they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> continue to live. For they were already alive; the expre&s;&s;ion that they &s;hall die if they live after the fle&s;h, denotes that they were alive, as well as the whole con|text. They were made alive by faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and it was nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould obey in order to continue &s;o: for if they again yield|ed them&s;elves "&s;ervants to &s;in, his &s;ervants they were to whom they obeyed whether of &s;in un|to death, or of obedience unto righteou&s;ne&s;s." We mu&s;t remember that believers are the heirs. They obtain the inheritance and keep it by faith; and as good works are enjoined as nece&s;&s;ary to their future happine&s;s, the ea&s;ie&s;t way to &s;olve this difficulty is to &s;uppo&s;e, that a certain degree of obedience is nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve their faith. If this can be allowed all the difficulty will va|ni&s;h. For a proof of it we may refer to what the apo&s;tle writes to the Hebrews. "Take heed Brethren le&s;t there be in any of you an evil
<PB N="58" REF="032050_0055_0FF1086FD5531F28">
heart of unbelief in departing from the living God. But exhort one another daily while it is called, to day le&s;t any of you be hardened through the deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in. For we are made partakers of Chri&s;t if we hold the begin|ning of our confidence &s;tedfa&s;t unto the end."</P>
<P>This &s;hews that &s;in hardens the heart and in|troduces unbelief. The apo&s;tle al&s;o advi&s;ing Timothy about holding faith and a good con&s;ci|ence, adds, "which &s;ome having put away, concerning faith have made &s;hipwreck;" which further proves that without obedience there is no continuance in the faith; and it is conform|able to what has been already mentioned, that &s;in will produce death; and it does &s;o by de&s;troying that faith by which life is pre&s;erved. And that obedience will confirm our faith St. James a&s;|&s;ures us when he &s;ays, that Abraham's faith by works was made perfect." So that we may &s;till &s;ay that believers are the true heirs, and yet allow that good works are nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, becau&s;e they &s;trengthen that faith that men mu&s;t pre&s;erve in order to partake of the fulne&s;s of the inheritance. This &s;eems to be an ea&s;ier way of reconciling the matter, than either by &s;aying on the one hand, that faith in it's nature includes e|vangelical obedience, or on the other, that good works are not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, but are only u&s;eful, ornamental, and evidences of a true faith; or even to &s;ay with Mr. Locke, That faith alone in&s;tates a man in a way of &s;alvation, and that a &s;incere obedience joined with faith is the condition on which he is finally &s;aved; be|cau&s;e
<PB N="59" REF="032050_0056_0FF108736846E9C0">
it is more agreeable to the tenor of the Go&s;pel, which declares that chri&s;tians are not only by grace &s;aved through faith, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the fir&s;t &s;tate they are brought into, but al&s;o that they are "kept by the power of God, thro' faith unto &s;alvation;" and that if that which they had heard &s;hould remain in them, they al&s;o &s;hould continue in the &s;on and in the father."</P>
<P>Now tho' we could not define obedience &s;o as to know when it was &s;incere or not, yet we may conceive a certain degree of it to continue us in the faith, and that of cour&s;e; or that a cer|tain degree of deviation <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> moral rectitude might de&s;troy our faith; and yet this to be ve|ry different from &s;aying that &s;incere obedience is the condition upon which eternal life is given. It is different in it's nature, and different in it's con&s;equences; becau&s;e a man who con&s;iders his future life to depend on his obedience is always under bondage, &amp; has not the freedom of a Son: whereas a &s;on looks upon the inheritance as his own, and though he &s;hould think it po&s;&s;ible to be ca&s;t off, yet as long as he finds in him&s;elf no di&s;|po&s;ition to revolt, he is under no fears about it. But the ca&s;e is very different in him "who thro' fear of death is all his lifetime &s;ubject to bondage."</P>
<P>When Mr. Locke mentions that "Adam's one &s;in had brought death on the Gentiles, from which they were all re&s;tored by Chri&s;t's death, with addition of eternal bli&s;s and glory to all tho&s;e who believe in him;" how can he con&s;i&s;t|ently
<PB N="60" REF="032050_0057_0FF108769B827718">
with this &s;ay el&s;ewhere, that a &s;incere obe|dience was al&s;o a condition? For the expre&s;&s;ion of eternal bli&s;s mu&s;t relate, not to the &s;tate of grace here, but to the &s;tate of glory hereafter. But perhaps the word obey was omitted by mi&s;|take. But when he &s;ays that tho&s;e who rely up|on God and his promi&s;es of grace and not upon their own performances, they are the children of Abraham who &s;hall inherit; There it is plain he means the fir&s;t &s;tate of grace to which they were admitted by faith alone; for he had ob&s;er|ved that the ble&s;&s;ing promi&s;ed to Abraham and to his &s;eed was wholly upon the account of faith."</P>
<P>And is it not a&s;toni&s;hing th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hould con|fine this inheritance to the &s;tate of grace only in this life? St. Paul de&s;ired to be found in Chri&s;t having the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God by faith&mdash;he does not mention it as a thing only to in&s;tate him in the favor of God, but as what he wi&s;hed to continue and be found in. And when he was about to be offered up what he &s;eemed to rejoice in was that "he had fought a good fight&mdash;that he had kept the faith&mdash;that thence|forth there was laid up for him a crown of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, which the Lord, the righteous judge would give him at that day, and not to him on|ly, but to all them that loved his appearing." And this we may readily &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e &s;uch as rely upon the promi&s;es of God being children of Abraham, would look for him and rejoice to &s;ee him.</P>
