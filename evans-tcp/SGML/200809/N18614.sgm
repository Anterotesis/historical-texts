<P><HI>THE following Sermon which was primarily de&s;igned for your private u&s;e, at your reque&s;t, is made public by the pre&s;s; whereby it is hoped (that by the ble&s;&s;ing of God) it will become u&s;eful to others, as well as to you. I &s;uppo&s;e one rea&s;on why you have de&s;ired its publication, may be for the purpo&s;e of tran&s;mitting down to the ri&s;ing generation, &s;ome &s;ignal di&s;pen&s;ations of divine Providence and grace in your day: Al&s;o, in part, in that 'tis a Half Century Sermon, it being rare that &s;uch an one is preach|ed; I my&s;elf never heard, nor &s;aw one: Partly, al&s;o, as I hope, for your own in&s;truction and edification. Although I was twice, or more than twice as long as common in the delivery, (being two hours) yet I ob&s;erved that your at|tention was kept up and increa&s;ing to the end. Under each branch of my di&s;cour&s;e I &s;tudied preci&s;ion and brevity, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing a flow of thought that I might avoid prolixity; but I found I could not po&s;&s;ibly do ju&s;tice in any tolerable degree, to &s;uch a variety of intere&s;ting</HI> topics, <HI>and avoid being lengthy. As to this little piece of mine, I que&s;tion not, but like the generality of &s;ingle &s;ermons, after it has had a peru&s;al for once, it will, by</HI> &s;ome, <HI>be laid a&s;ide as worn out and forgotten; but "as your times are in the hand of the Lord," I tru&s;t you will find &s;omething here, that may be u&s;eful in all the times that pa&s;s over you; that it will e&s;pecially be u&s;eful for Communicants to read after they come from the Lord's-Table; and when you are called to elect a Pa&s;tor, if I am then dead, I &s;hall hereby &s;peak to you.&mdash;May the Lord continue to own and ble&s;s you&mdash;and inrich you with all the graces of his Spirit&mdash;And may we rejoice together in the pre&s;ence of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, at his appearing. To this end may He ble&s;s the following &s;ermon to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, (and al&s;o to o|thers) which is the prayer of him who is your &s;ervant for Je&s;us' &s;ake.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Anniver&s;ary, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I AM come into this awful and delightful de&s;k at this time with a view to deliver you an Anniver&s;ary Eu|chari&s;tical and Half-Century Sermon. This three-fold occa&s;ion will nece&s;&s;arily invite your mediation upon a variety of topics. I &s;hall not undertake that which is beyond the compa&s;s of my power, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> fully to a&s;certain how far forth we &s;tand connected with things pa&s;t, pre|&s;ent and to come, but I &s;hall lead you to &s;ee, that as call|ed into exi&s;tence, "your times are in the hand of God"&mdash;That you are acting a part upon the &s;tage of life, as in a probationary &s;tate for an endle&s;s eternity&mdash;That you will &s;oon exchange worlds, and meet the augu&s;t realities of an everla&s;ting &s;tate&mdash;That preparation therefor, is of the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible importance&mdash;That you are under in|finite obligations to live to God, and to acknowledge Him in all that variety of di&s;pen&s;ation, wherein he pa&s;&s;es before you; &s;uffice it to &s;ay, at pre&s;ent, I &s;hall invite your run of meditation corre&s;pondent to the three-fold occa&s;ion of my preaching at this time. While a num|ber of texts have been revolved in my mind, adapted to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, I have elected tho&s;e words which you may read in
<Q><BIBL>PSALM xxxi. 15.</BIBL>
<HI>My Times are in thy Hand.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIS P&s;alm was pen'd by the Royal Prophet <HI>Da|vid</HI> in his advanced age, and when expo&s;ed to the lo&s;s of life. In this &s;ituation he had recour&s;e by faith to his God, and &s;oon became the &s;ubject of apprehended &s;afety, triumphant joy, and divine gloriation in Him. He had ju&s;t &s;aid, "thou art my God," my God in co|venant with me, and then adds, "my times are in thy Hand." The P&s;almi&s;t makes u&s;e of the plural number,
<PB N="6" REF="024155_0004_0FC3C87E323A8D10">
"my times," that is, all the events of time, and the tim|ing of them; pro&s;perity, adver&s;ity, life and death, all the changing &s;cenes of life from the fir&s;t aera or beginning of time, to the end thereof with us, are in God's hand. That is, in the hand of divine power, and under the all-di&s;po&s;ing providence of God: for this figurative mode of expre&s;&s;ion, a&s;cribing a hand to God, who is a Spirit, and hath not bodily parts, is to be under&s;tood only as expre&s;s'd by way of analogy or allu&s;ion, and principally imports divine power and providential influence, or the exertment of God's power and perfections on the crea|ture.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. 59. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. Job 2. 10. &amp;c.</NOTE> The words of our text contain an excellent con|fe&s;&s;ion of faith, made by the "man after God's own heart:" A confe&s;&s;ion highly worthy of our imitation, both as to the matter and manner thereof; truly be|lieving that "our times are in the hand of God." In as much as we <HI>all</HI> give our a&s;&s;ent to this intere&s;ting truth, the proof thereof at this time may be the le&s;s needful.</P>
<P>Therefore in di&s;cour&s;ing further upon the words, it is propo&s;ed by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of divine grace,

<P>I. In the fir&s;t place then, I am to point out &s;ome &s;ignal times and capital events, to which the words of our text may refer, or will aptly apply. Here we may fir&s;t ob&s;erve, that the fir&s;t exi&s;tence of man and beginning of time with him is in the Lord's hand. Let philo&s;ophers di&s;pute about the origin, nature and e&s;&s;ence of the &s;oul of man&mdash;when fir&s;t formed by the creating power of the Father of Spirits, and when fir&s;t united to the body; and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> divines determine with St. Augu&s;tin, that the &s;oul is
<PB N="7" REF="024155_0005_0FC3C87F8BF87400">
created in infu&s;ing, and in infu&s;ing it is created, <HI>all</HI> mu&s;t agree that there is the beginning of time with man. Self-exi&s;tence, independency and eternity, as being from ever|la&s;ting to everla&s;ting, is peculiar to the great I AM, or Jehovah. As to man, a creature of time, in connexion with eternity, he is called into exi&s;tence and is born in the &s;et time that God de&s;igned and ordered, as doing all things "according to the coun&s;el of his will:" Hence the royal in&s;pir'd Preacher tells us, "there is a time to be born." Thus it hath been with reference to <HI>all</HI> that have come into exi&s;tence and been born in the old or new world; or that &s;hall till time will be no more. God "hath made of one blood <HI>all</HI> nations of men for to dwell upon the face of the earth, and hath determined"&mdash;or <HI>hath marked out</HI> in his eternal and unerring coun&s;el <HI>the times</HI> fore allotted [to each] in their re&s;pective order, and appointed the &s;everal boundaries of their <HI>habitation</HI>&mdash;to this one great end, that they might be excited to &s;eek after the Lord their maker.</P>
<P>I proceed&mdash;the time of the new birth, and for the effec|tual application, or actual be&s;towment of &s;alvation <HI>which is by Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> is in the Lord's hand. This implies the mi&s;&s;ion of the Holy Spirit, his preparatory work, (in the adult)&mdash;his regenerating act, or his implanting a principle of &s;piritual life and grace&mdash;and effectual calling by his powerful efficiency:&mdash;by all which, the happy &s;ubjects thereof, are now made <HI>partakers of Chri&s;t,</HI> and brought into the <HI>fellow&s;hip of the Son of God:</HI> they are now <HI>in him,</HI> "who of God is made unto <HI>them</HI> wi&s;dom, and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;anctification, and redemption." They now through faith receive the <HI>atonement,</HI> and are not only ju&s;tified and &s;anctified, but have al&s;o "power given them to become the children of God; and if chil|dren, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The Holy Spirit is given to them to dwell in them, as his proper la&s;ting abode, and as a divine &s;uper|natural &s;pring of life and action. They &s;hare in all the benefits of redemption by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and are crowned
<PB N="8" REF="024155_0006_0FC3C8810AC2BED8">
with the loving-kindne&s;s of God, in the life which now is, but mo&s;t eminently in the life which is to come.&mdash;Now the time for <HI>all this,</HI> is in the Lord's hand. He hath his &s;et time therefor, "a day of power," "the day of e&s;pou&s;al," of joy and gladne&s;s, "the accepted time, the day of &s;alvation:" the hour now comes, in which the dead are made to hear and live. They mu&s;t have pre&s;ervation in life, till the happy moment of their &s;pi|ritual marriage with Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The Lord &s;aid unto them when in their blood live: (Heb.) "I &s;aid unto thee live in thy blood."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezek. 16. 6.</NOTE> They mu&s;t live until the fixed time for God to manife&s;t his infinite love to them. Then the decree brings forth by all-powerful and all-glorious operation. A work this is of equal nece&s;&s;ity as that of impetration or procurement of redemption. This work of application, is therefore a work of the la&s;t importance:&mdash;What is Chri&s;t to me, unle&s;s he is mine?</P>
<P>Again, Times of increa&s;ing light, for transformation&mdash;for the formal &s;ealing the Holy Spirit, and thereby a&s;&s;urance of divine love&mdash;and for &s;en&s;ible nearne&s;s to, and &s;olemn, delightful fellow&s;hip and communion with the divine Trinity&mdash;and for abounding &s;olid joy and peace divine, are in the Lord's hand. The&s;e &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, the&s;e divine beatitudes lie inwrap'd in precious promi&s;es, as rich veins of gold and &s;ilver do in a mine, and by the experiment or power of faith, become inlay|ed and clu&s;tered together in the heart of the real Chri&s;|tian. Every true convert as the &s;ubject of divine illu|mination, has a &s;piritual knowledge of the glorious ob|jects of divine faith and love; and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;ome degree of peace and joy divine, at lea&s;t, &s;ome times, or if under de&s;ertion, is mourning the want thereof. For otherwi&s;e, how can it be, that "old things are pa&s;&s;ed away, and all things are become new?" Every true believer is the &s;ub|ject of the <HI>object &s;eal</HI> of the Holy Spirit, which di&s;tin|gui&s;hes the per&s;on from others, as now &s;anctified and &s;et apart for God and his &s;ervice. The <HI>formal &s;ealing</HI> of
<PB N="9" REF="024155_0007_0FC3C8828AB25F70">
the Holy Spirit, is, his giving a &s;ure and certain te&s;|timony to the reality of that work of grace He hath wrought in our &s;ouls, and to our intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, and our eternal &s;alvation, according to the promi&s;es, "that are yea and amen in him, to the glory of God." Now fears and doubts are exiled, and the love of God ratified and cleared up to the &s;oul. This certificate brought from the throne of mercy, by the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit &s;ealed with Chri&s;t's blood, u&s;hers into the heart light and life, joy and peace divine, and even heaven upon earth. This formal &s;eal of the Holy Spirit never preceeds, but is con&s;equent upon be|lieving, as the Apo&s;tle &s;aith to the <HI>Ephe&s;ians,</HI> "after ye believed, ye were &s;ealed by the Holy Spirit of promi&s;e."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. 1. 13.</NOTE> Sometimes it follows immediately upon the &s;oul's fir&s;t clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t. The happy young convert hath &s;uch powerful illumination, clear views of divine ob|jects, vi&s;ible actings of grace, and &s;en&s;ibility of divine love as give a comfortable or full a&s;&s;urance of an inter|e&s;t in Chri&s;t, and the promi&s;es. Unutterably happy the portion of &s;uch converts, if they never lo&s;e their fir&s;t love&mdash;per&s;evere in a walk under the cloudle&s;s &s;hines of Jehovah's precious countenance, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the power and comfort of religion, till time with them is no more. But commonly young converts are the &s;ubjects of light and darkne&s;s hopes and fears, and are often well nigh, or quite giving up their hope of a &s;aving change, after their fir&s;t light and comfort. If for a time they think their mountain &s;tands &s;trong, they &s;hall never be moved, yet pre&s;ently they are in darkne&s;s and trouble again. Noth|ing can, or ought to give &s;atisfaction in this ca&s;e, &s;hort of increa&s;ing light and &s;en&s;ible actings of grace&punc; That which is now wanting is the formal &s;ealing of the Holy Spirit, which is frequently given after exerci&s;es have run high, and the &s;oul has followed hard after God.&mdash;"Then &s;hall we know, when we follow on to know the Lord, his going forth is prepared as the morning;"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ho&s;ea, 6. 3.&mdash;P&s;alm 30. 5.</NOTE> that after

a night of darkne&s;s, perplexity and weeping, the morn|ing comes with beams of light and joy, leading on to meridian &s;plendor, and fulne&s;s of bli&s;s, in duration eter|nal. The Lord's people who make bu&s;ine&s;s of religion, and keep up a clo&s;e walk with Him, find more &s;en&s;ible nearne&s;s to him, and more intimate communion with him at &s;ome particular &s;ea&s;ons than they enjoy in a con|&s;tant way. Times in which, comparatively, (as <HI>Job</HI> &s;peaks) they only hear with the ear, and times in which they &s;ee with the eye.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job 42. 5.</NOTE> The Father of mercies and of lights raying into their &s;ouls, they have encrea&s;ing, &s;pi|ritual knowledge; and thereby increa&s;ing views of the true moral beauty and infinite amiablene&s;s of divine ob|jects and divine things. They behold the moral perfec|tion of Chri&s;t, the infinite excellency and amiablene&s;s of his per&s;on, and his &s;ufficiency as mediator; and under clear and lively views of his divine and mediatorial glo|ry, they find and feel a divine gloriation in him, and ravi&s;hing &s;weetne&s;s, and heavenly joy in his excellent and tran&s;cendent love. They behold him as "altogether lovely," having all de&s;irable excellencies in him. The Lord's people now behold his glory &s;hining in all his works; in &s;pecial the harmony and infinite glory of his redeeming attributes as manife&s;ted in the face, in the Per|&s;on and mediation of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in the a&s;to|ni&s;hing work of man's redemption by him. They &s;ee "that mercy and truth have met together; that righte|ou&s;ne&s;s and peace have embraced each other.&mdash;In Chri&s;t all the divine attributes appear united in the mo&s;t glori|ous manner. When mercy &s;hines and triumphs in infi|nite grace and glory; when love divine &s;toops down to the deeps of mi&s;ery to fetch poor, lo&s;t, ju&s;tly condemned &s;inners to the heights of eternal glory, inflexible, &s;evere and awful ju&s;tice, and ab&s;olute purity and holine&s;s &s;it on the throne of glory, and triumph in infinite eternal ho|nour. If a Saint were to &s;peak out and tell us his own expe|riences at &s;uch an hour as this, might we not expect to hear

He appears in the glory of his infinite and adorable &s;overeignty; the &s;upreme of Beings, &s;itting on a throne of grace, in the glory of his holine&s;s.

it&s;elf to gra&s;p as much of it, as it can receive for the pre|&s;ent.

The &s;oul is now in&s;pired with undi&s;&s;embled gratitude, adoration and prai&s;e; but it &s;eems to be a &s;ort of ra&s;hne&s;s and boldne&s;s for a creature &s;o vile, &s;o feeble and in&s;ufficient therefor, to attempt the celebration of the prai&s;es of a Being &s;o infinitely great and glorious in holine&s;s, as Jehovah now appears to the view of the &s;oul; yet a &s;ight of the moral beauty and infinite amiablene&s;s of his perfections, &s;en&s;ibility of his infinite love, and of infinite obligation to Him, &s;eem to have a &s;ort of an omnipotent efficacy and &s;weet con&s;traint in them, &s;o that the &s;oul cannot refrain "crying, Hallelu|jah!

I find a new en|gagedne&s;s of heart and di&s;po&s;ition therefor, and con|&s;ecrate my&s;elf afre&s;h to the &s;ervice and glory of the adorable TRINITY forever and ever.</Q> Whatever o|thers may imagine, the Lord's people well know, that <HI>the&s;e</HI> divine manife&s;tations and operations, communica|tions and prelibations of future immen&s;e and immortal glory, are of and from the Lord; and that the timing thereof is in his &s;overeign hand.</P>
<P>I add, tho&s;e changes and vici&s;&s;itudes of time which take place among men, with reference to pro&s;perity and ad|ver&s;ity are ordered by, and are in the hand of God.&mdash;The P&s;almi&s;t makes u&s;e of the plural number <HI>times,</HI> as expre&s;&s;ive of vici&s;&s;itudes.&mdash;The world is a rolling wheel, and every thing in it, even tho&s;e things that appear mo&s;t &s;table, may &s;uffer change and mutation. Nobles, Prin|ces, States, Kingdoms and Empires; Cities, Towns, Fa|milies and Individuals may appear for the pre&s;ent in a flouri&s;hing &s;ituation, and &s;eem to &s;wim on the &s;mooth face of plea&s;ure; wait but a little while and the &s;cene is all changed; the Lord, in who&s;e hand our times are, turns a leaf in the volume of his decrees, and tho&s;e who &s;ung for joy of heart, are &s;uddenly plunged in mi&s;ery and &s;or|row.&mdash;Others that have long groaned under burdens, &s;ighed in mi&s;ery under painful &s;ufferings, as ha&s;tily leap from them to liberty, light and comfort. The Lord's people have new &s;cenes almo&s;t continually opening to view; all cannot exhibit vi&s;ibility of change as <HI>Job, Jo|&s;eph</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="024155_0012_0FC3C88A1A5126F0">
and many others have done; but all are acquaint|ed with vici&s;&s;itudes.&mdash;Happy they who are habitually and actually prepared to meet all the changing &s;cenes of life, "and &s;tand &s;ecure amid&s;t a falling world:" And who can truly &s;ay,
<Q><L>Through all the changing &s;cenes of life,</L>
<L>In trouble and in joy,</L>
<L>The prai&s;es of my God &s;hall &s;till</L>
<L>My heart and tongue employ.</L></Q>
All this &s;trange variety of changes rolling on in perpetu|al &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, is the work of God; He forms the light of pro&s;perity, and creates the darkne&s;s of adver&s;ity; good and evil come from his hand.</P>
<P>Moreover, the time of deliverance from trials and af|flictive ills is in God's hand. The Lord's people in this their &s;tate of probation often &s;hare in heavy trials; &s;ometimes they are grievou&s;ly per&s;ecuted; &s;ometimes they have to conflict with terrible temptations, keen priva|tions under the lo&s;s of their deare&s;t outward comforts; and &s;ometimes are lamenting the ab&s;ence of the Comfor|ter. Their exerci&s;es often run high in a great variety of re|&s;pects; they learn that in the "world they &s;hall have trou|ble," and the cro&s;s is the way to the crown. The kind, the degree, and the duration of their &s;uffering afflictive ill is in the Lord's hand, and he hath a &s;et time for their deliverance as really as for Zion's pro&s;perity; and as he had for the liberation of his people from <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Ba|bylon</HI></P>
<P>I add, the time for a per&s;on to exerci&s;e faith and re|pentance is in the Lord's hand. Sinners under the go&s;|pel are called upon to exerci&s;e repentance towards God, and faith in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that they e&s;cape eternal death, and po&s;&s;e&s;s eternal life. For this infinite|ly important purpo&s;e the Lord allows &s;inners a &s;pace of time, as he gave <HI>Jazabel</HI> a &s;pace to repent. The day of grace hath differing periods; is &s;ometimes longer and
<PB N="15" REF="024155_0013_0FC3C88F5EDC73A0">
&s;ometimes &s;horter, as the day of life is. We &s;ay the &s;in|ner's time for faith and repentance is in the hand of God, not eternity in the hand of God for this purpo&s;e; for beyond time, in eternity, there is no repentance unto life; in&s;piration a&s;&s;ures us that all beyond time is eter|nal; therefore if the &s;inner goes into the eternal &s;tate without grace, he will abide without grace forever. Here it may be ob&s;erved, that our day of grace may ex|pire before the day of life; as the <HI>&s;talk</HI> may continue after the <HI>flower</HI> be dropt off. There may be a judicial weighing of the &s;inner, a <HI>mene t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">kal,</HI> that puts an eter|nal period to his day of grace. God in ju&s;t and right|eous judgment may give up di&s;obedient &s;inners to a &s;tate of blindne&s;s and hardne&s;s of heart, and by oath bar them out of re&s;t forever. Hence then how exceedingly precious is <HI>time,</HI> an happy or mi&s;erable eternity may de|pend on the good or ill improvement of the pre&s;ent fleeting moments.</P>
<P>Moreover the time for a per&s;on's u&s;efulne&s;s on the &s;tage of life is in the Lord's hand. Every per&s;on, e&s;pe|cially every one that lays claim to the chri&s;tian character, is indi&s;pen&s;ably obligated to live to God, and to be u&s;eful to &s;ociety. Obligation is increa&s;ed by the powers, ca|pacities, talents and &s;tations, with which per&s;ons are be|tru&s;ted for the purpo&s;e of &s;erving God, and their gener|ation. Very various are the &s;tations a&s;&s;igned mankind, and as various the &s;ervices called for; &s;ervices to be per|formed for the glorifying of God, and innumerable &s;er|vices to be done for the bodies and &s;ouls of men; to pro|mote their &s;ecular and civil intere&s;ts, and their eternal &s;alvation. Some are advanced to the mo&s;t honorable and important &s;tations in <HI>Church</HI> or <HI>State</HI> for the pur|po&s;e of u&s;efulne&s;s. Many are u&s;eful in the humble walk of private life. Others in a two-fold capacity at the &s;ame time, or at divers times in different &s;tations. The &s;overeign Lord of the univer&s;e can with infinite ea&s;e rai&s;e up, qualify and eminently improve a man for a time in a &s;tation high, intere&s;ting and va&s;tly important,

and &s;oon improve him in a &s;phere of action equally high and important. Surpri&s;ing and inconceivable as the be|neficial con&s;equences are, and will be, we may behold the &s;ame extraordinary per&s;on endowed with rare mea|&s;ures of military &s;kill and prowe&s;s, acting the <HI>Hero</HI> in the military line, "for our people, and for the cities of our God," and by his ble&s;&s;ing, &s;ucce&s;s, and in con&s;equence crowned with the laurels of victory and triumph over mighty forces, ra&s;hly acting the part of oppo&s;ition to the free enjoyment of liberty and property.

purpo&s;es we &s;erve are high and God-like. We are to "gather fruit unto life eternal." If <HI>&s;ome</HI> mo&s;tly employ their time and talents in the lower &s;phere of &s;caffolding work; there are <HI>others</HI> more highly and happily employ|ed as at work upon the Temple, as in&s;trumental in &s;quar|ing and laying the &s;tones in the &s;piritual building, "the church of the living God." They are enabled to improve their gifts and exerci&s;e their graces with a wi&s;e reference to promoting the Redeemer's kingdom among men:&mdash;and by the co-operation of the Holy Spirit with their mini&s;trations they "turn &s;inners to righteou&s;ne&s;s, and build up &s;aints in faith, holine&s;s and comfort:" and as a gracious reward &s;hall &s;hine as &s;tars of the fir&s;t magnitude in the kingdom of glory forever. Now the duration of time for u&s;efulne&s;s in any &s;tation what&s;oever is in the Lord's hand. Some have but a &s;hort &s;pace of time and opportunity allowed them for u&s;efulne&s;s in the world; others a longer &s;pace.&mdash;Some have a long run and &s;eries of opportunity for &s;pecial &s;ervice, and are eminently u&s;eful to a good old age. More eminent u&s;efulne&s;s may cea&s;e before the expiration of life; yet are the Lord's people u&s;eful as long as they can pray and exhibit prai&s;e-worthy example. With re&s;pect to degrees of u&s;efulne&s;s, and the duration of time therefor, the glorious and adorable &s;o|vereignty of God is mo&s;t eminently di&s;played.</P>
<P>La&s;tly here, the duration and end of a man's time is in God's hand. "There is a time to die," as well as to be born, and the one, and the other abide unalterably fixed in the va&s;t volume of the divine decrees. We are im|mortal till the appointed time comes, for the end of time with us, beyond that we cannot po&s;&s;e&s;s life for a moment, whether elder or younger. "Man knoweth not his time;" but God as the &s;overeign Lord of life and death, "hath appointed his bounds that he cannot pa&s;s," and hath <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the final hour and moment, when time with us, "&s;hall be no more."

Thus have we taken a brief &s;urvey of the times of men as in the hand of God, and &s;een how the text will apply: We now proceed,</P>
<P>II. <HI>Secondly,</HI> to con&s;ider the import of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">aint's con|fe&s;&s;ion, that his "times are in Gods hand." Now this implies a firm belief of the being and infinite perfections of God. To profe&s;s that the times of men are in the hand of God, and yet not to believe the exi&s;tence of a God, is infinitely ab&s;urd. That there is a &s;upreme and e|ternal Being, and that he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all infinite perfect|ions, are truths &s;o vi&s;ible by the light of nature, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> declares the <HI>heathen</HI> inexcu&s;able that call the&s;e truths in que&s;tion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE> Every thing in the natural and moral world&mdash;the effects of the exertion of infinite attributes, and the vi&s;ible accompli&s;hment of the prophecies and promi&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;cripture demon&s;trate to the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">aint that there is a &s;upreme eternal Being, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an a&s;&s;emblage of all infinite po&s;&s;ible perfections. Superadded to <HI>all this</HI> the true believer has a &s;piritual &s;upernatural knowlege of God in Chri&s;t, by divine illumination, and a feeling &s;en&s;e of the pre&s;ence of God; of his divinity, and the divinity of bible truth; as every one has that is the happy &s;ubject of &s;aving faith.</P>
<P>We proceed, this confe&s;&s;ion as made by the &s;aint acting in character, implies regeneration, the infu&s;ion of grace, and exerci&s;e of &s;aith, by the energy of the Holy Spirit. No unregenerate per&s;on can make this confe&s;&s;ion both as to matter and manner, as it ought to be made; for it &s;uppo&s;es the exerci&s;e of &s;aith. The p&s;almi&s;t in the exer|ci&s;e of &s;aith, &s;aid, "my God," and in the exerci&s;e of that &s;aith, he adds, "my times are in thy hand."</P>
<P>I add, this confe&s;&s;ion, "my times are in thy hand," implies a firm belief and full per&s;ua&s;ion of the governing providence of God. The &s;aint has full a&s;&s;urance from divine revelation that the ONE &s;upreme God, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> great Creator, is al&s;o the governor of the univer&s;e: that his
<PB N="19" REF="024155_0017_0FC3C8955F6A4450">
providence is <HI>univer&s;al,</HI> and extends to every individual in the whole &s;y&s;tem of beings. The &s;aint knows and be|lieves that the divine pages plainly teach us, that God is qualified, by his infinite perfections, for the government of the world; that 'tis nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould govern it, and that he therefore does. "The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom ruleth over all:"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm 103. 19.</NOTE> over all things in the natural world; and he is governor and judge al&s;o of the moral world, angels and men,&mdash;"and he doth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dan. 4. 35.</NOTE> The &s;aint believes and confe&s;&s;es, that every thing which comes to pa&s;s is by the ordinative or permi&s;&s;ive provi|dence of God.</P>
<P>Again, this confe&s;&s;ion implies, that the time allowed us here is God's time, and man's talent. To confe&s;s that our times are in God's hand, is to acknowledge that we are not lords of the time allowed us; but &s;tewards under him, intru&s;ted by him with time, as a mo&s;t precious tal|ent, for the improvement of which we are accountable to him. Time ought to be con&s;idered as one of the mo&s;t important betru&s;tments committed to us, to be employed, in the &s;ervice of God; and in a way of preparation for eternity. Precious and important we call the talent of time, for the man is yet unborn that can fully weigh and comprehend the worth of it; while on it hangs &s;u&s;pended the weight of worlds eternal: yet there is no one talent &s;o mi&s;u&s;ed and &s;o univer&s;ally, wretchedly abu&s;ed by man|kind as the talent of time. Shall death-beds tell us what it is to murder time? time that is God's, and in his hand.</P>
<P>Moreover, this confe&s;&s;ion&mdash;as connected with the fore|going words implies a firm belief of protection and &s;afety. The <HI>p&s;almi&s;t</HI> had &s;aid in the preceding ver&s;e, his enemies had devi&s;ed to take away his life, he adds, "but I tru&s;ted in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> O Jehovah: I &s;aid thou art my God:" Jeho|vah imports being and eternity, and his name [FL.] that
<PB N="20" REF="024155_0018_0FC3C89774114110">
follows, tran&s;lated [GOD] notes forth his power: Now this "Jehovah, my God," who is Being from everla&s;t|ing to everla&s;ting, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of omnipotent, &s;upreme and eternal power is become engaged for my protection and &s;afety. His Name is the a&s;ylum or tower to which I have recour&s;e by &s;aith, and am entirely &s;afe. Jehovah, God, is my <HI>&s;hield,</HI> as well as "my exceeding great re|ward:" I &s;hall abide &s;afe and comfortable "under the &s;hadow of the Almighty, in the &s;ecret place of the Mo&s;t HIGH:" His infinite attributes a&s;certain my &s;afety and felicity for ever and ever.</P>
<P>Again, this confe&s;&s;ion&mdash;as in connexion with the fore|going words, implies &s;ight and &s;en&s;ibility of infinite di&s;t|ance between God and man, the Creator and the creature. "Jehovah my God," "my times are in thy hand," all &s;tand connected together, but imply infinite di&s;proportion between the beings &s;poken of. Jehovah &s;peaks being it&s;elf, a fulne&s;s of being, an immen&s;e &s;ea of being, and in whole very being it&s;elf. Self-exi&s;ting, independent, fountain of all being, eternal, immutable, infinite in power and all perfections. Now if we &s;et this acknowledgement in contra&s;t with the confe&s;&s;ion the p&s;almi&s;t makes of him|&s;elf, the di&s;tance and di&s;proportion will appear as it really is infinite. <HI>Jehovah,</HI> thou art being it&s;elf, very being; I am but &s;hew, little more than a &s;hew, a mere &s;hadow, a &s;emblance of being: Thou ha&s;t an infinitude of being, which I have not; I am nearer to nothing than fulne&s;s of being: Thou art &s;elf-exi&s;tent and independent; what little of being I have is derived; I am a created, depen|dant creature: "my times are in thy hand," thou art eternal, from eternity to eternity unchangeably the &s;ame. I have ju&s;t come into exi&s;tence, am but of ye&s;terday, a creature of time; thou art eternal, what thou now art thou ever ha&s;t been, and what thou ever ha&s;t been, and now art, thou forever mu&s;t needs be. Thus we &s;ee the im|port of the confe&s;&s;ion in our text.</P>
<P>I again add&mdash;this confe&s;&s;ion, "my times are in thy
<PB N="21" REF="024155_0019_0FC3C8A04B811180">
hand," implies a nece&s;&s;ary dependance upon God, and acquie&s;cence in it, as &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to the divine will, as fit|ting it &s;hould be &s;o. The dependance of the ray upon the &s;un, of the &s;tream upon the fountain, can be but a faint emblem of the nece&s;&s;ary dependance of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">aint upon God for being and well-being. This the <HI>p&s;almi&s;t</HI> well knew, when he made the confe&s;&s;ion in the text; he &s;aw the events of time were in the hand of his God, and that it was fitting it &s;hould be &s;o, he therefore &s;ubmitted to him as on the throne of government and grace. He now did that which the Lord's people can when they have a right frame of heart, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> &s;ign a blank and leave it with the Lord to fill up: knowing that his power is immen&s;e and uncontrollable, his &s;overeign will ab&s;olutely good and infinitely perfect, and that the &s;upreme wi&s;dom can|not err.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, this confe&s;&s;ion, "my times are in thy hand," implies &s;piritual joy and divine gloriation. The words evidently carry in them an air of joy and triumph. My times, all the events of time, are in the hand of Jehovah, who is my God, who will order all things for me accord|ing to covenant engagement. In Jehovah, my God, I boa&s;t all the day long, my &s;oul goes to him as to my "exceeding joy," my God in Chri&s;t. I am the &s;ubject of ineffable joy and divine gloriation, and &s;hall be forever, for "my times are in the hand of Jehovah my God."</P>
<P>We may hence &s;ee and learn, that there is much inclu|ded in the &s;aint's confe&s;&s;ion rightly made.&mdash;That it con|cerns us to be looking and preparing for changes.&mdash;That it becomes us to be reconciled to our own decea&s;e, and the decea&s;e of relatives and friends; for our, and their times, are in the Lord's hand.&mdash;That to &s;ee all things and events in the hand of God, and to acquie&s;ce therein, is the one only certain way for re&s;t and comfort in the world.&mdash;But we mu&s;t not dwell here at pre&s;ent.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here this <HI>&s;ermon</HI> may be divided.</NOTE></P>

Careful to avoid every thing of a &s;uper&s;titious a&s;pect, yet employing common time to holy purpo&s;es, as we have opportunity; from a principle of zeal toward God, and of care for our &s;ouls: wi&s;hing to redeem time, and to begin the year with God, by the exerci&s;es of wor|&s;hip and &s;olemn devotion.

How very &s;ingular and important our exi&s;tence here in this world: formed with &s;uch an alliance to angel and &s;pirit as to take rank above all the creatures on this &s;ide the &s;tars! From the noble &s;tructure and powers of the human mind, it appears that we were formed with a &s;ubjective capacity, capable of the everla&s;ting fruition of God.

How hath the Lord opened the trea&s;ures of his goodne&s;s and pour'd his ble&s;&s;ings in upon you on all &s;ides, and followed you with his rich, various, free and repeated mercies from the fir&s;t commencement of your exi&s;tence to the pre&s;ent moment. In the days of helple&s;s infancy, and through every &s;tage of life, how hath he provided for you, and conferred the ble&s;&s;ings of health, food and raiment upon you? The luminaries of heaven &s;hine, the earth labours, and all the (otherwi&s;e di&s;cordant) elements con&s;pire to promote your comfort. Power and goodne&s;s divine have accompanied every moment of life, equally &s;wift in approach, for your con&s;ervation and con&s;olation. If the &s;eries of mercies &s;eem'd for a time in a mea&s;ure interrupted, by afflictive ills, this manner of di&s;pen&s;ation, was wi&s;ely and well and even kindly calculated to afford you le&s;&s;ons of u&s;eful in|&s;truction. When &s;ickne&s;s and death have invaded your neighbours, your friend; or relative, and &s;pread havock and de&s;olation around you, and it may be have taken away a member of the family in which you live, you have e&s;caped; and this day appear as monuments of God's &s;paring mercy. How great the preventing and deliver|ing goodne&s;s of God! What numerous &s;een, and yet more un&s;een dangers have been e&s;caped? What numberle&s;s po&s;itive ble&s;&s;ings, temporal, &s;piritual, per&s;onal and rela|tive, public and private, have been confer'd upon you by the <HI>immediate</HI> hand of God, your bountiful benefactor.

In con&s;equence of the <HI>donation,</HI> the <HI>mediation,</HI> the <HI>obedi|ence</HI> and <HI>death</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> you are invited, and urged by

motives that have &s;anctions of infinite weight, to make &s;ure of an intere&s;t in Him by faith, and thereby of eternal ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.

In the view of the&s;e numerous and mighty efforts of divine goodne&s;s to promote your <HI>well-being</HI> in both <HI>worlds,</HI> may it not be &s;aid, "what could have been done more, that has not been done?"&mdash;Surely &s;uch an amazing &s;eries of &s;ingular unmerited favours ought to inflame your gratitude, and to excite entire con&s;ecration to the &s;ervice and glory of God, your, &s;upreme benefactor. But if you refu&s;e,&mdash;hear O earth, with horror; be a&s;toni&s;hed, O ye heavens, that God the fountain of being and all good, has &s;o little gratitude from our &s;tupid world! Here I might naturally addre&s;s the Lord's people, who hope they have experi|mentally known his love; but this will &s;oon come in of cour&s;e.

and crowned the year with numerous &s;alvations; but the time would fail. In the view of &s;uch a profu&s;ion of ble&s;|&s;ings let me call upon you cautiou&s;ly to avoid vile and horrid ingratitude; ingratitude that may ju&s;tly &s;hock and confound&mdash;while it is enough to &s;ink the whole world into the depths of hell! To be every moment receiving ble&s;&s;ings from God, and yet perpetually offending him to his face; can <HI>infernal &s;pirits</HI> in everla&s;ting chains be|come guilty of &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing ingratitude! Let me invite you to abound in the duty of commemorating glorious divine operations, relative to God's wonderful works of <HI>creation, redemption,</HI> and <HI>providence:</HI> and take heed that you don't content your&s;elves with a mere <HI>hi&s;t|orical</HI> and <HI>&s;uperficial</HI> commemoration; but ever look that your <HI>remembrance</HI> of the&s;e high and mighty events be attempered to the <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>importance</HI> of them, and applied to <HI>experimental, devotional</HI> and <HI>practical</HI> purpo&s;es in religion. Our remembrance mu&s;t be attended with the exerci&s;e of particular graces and virtues&mdash;with a&s;&s;ent and per&s;ua&s;ion&mdash;with approbation and wonder&mdash;with humility and reverence&mdash;with contrition and penitence&mdash;with affection and complacence&mdash;with thank&s;giving and prai&s;e&mdash;with faith, hope, prayer, frequency and per&s;eve|rence&mdash;and with corre&s;pondent life and cour&s;e of action.&mdash;Thus let us enter upon a new revolution of time; and as knowing our "times are in the Lord's hand." I have only to add here, as in the view of &s;uch peculiar di&s;tingui&s;hing favours as we all &s;hare in; and of the an|&s;werable obligations we are all under,&mdash;"I be&s;eech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you pre|&s;ent your bodies a living &s;acrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your rea&s;onable &s;ervice.

<P>Fora&s;much as a large number of this large auditory have this day partaken of the commemorating ordinance of the <HI>Lord's &s;upper,</HI> this hath given occa&s;ion for this part of my di&s;cour&s;e, which is called <HI>Euchari&s;tical.</HI> The &s;acrament of the Lord's-&s;upper hath &s;everal <HI>names</HI> by which it is known. It is frequently called the <HI>euchari&s;t;</HI> &s;o the <HI>Greek church</HI> called it, and we from them give it the &s;ame name, which properly &s;ignifies a thank&s;giving; and it is &s;o called in the fir&s;t place, becau&s;e our Lord in the in&s;titution of it, <HI>gave thanks,</HI> (1 Cor. 11. 24.) In the next place it is &s;o called, becau&s;e we in partaking thereof ought to give thanks. It is an ordinance of thank&s;giving, appointed for the joyful celebrating of the Redeemer's prai&s;es. The cup of <HI>&s;alvation</HI> mu&s;t be "the cup of ble&s;&s;ing:" the high prai&s;es of God &s;hould be in our mouths and in our hearts.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It hath been the practice of many churches of Chri&s;t to have a thank&s;giving day, following the <HI>euchari&s;t</HI>&mdash;others have a euchari&s;tical &s;ermon, exhorting to give thanks, and to walk with God.</NOTE> To attend the euchari&s;t or holy &s;acrament, is to take an oath of allegiance unto the Lord. God doth in and by this ordinance &s;eal to us, "to be to us a God:" and herein we &s;eal to him "to be to him a people." We re&s;ign and give up our whole &s;elves, body, &s;oul, and &s;pirit to God the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t; covenanting and promi&s;ing to walk clo&s;ely with him in all manner of go&s;pel obedience all our days.&mdash;Therefore it will be natural upon this occa&s;ion to exhort the Lord's people to thank&s;giving&mdash;and con&s;ecration to the &s;ervice of God.</P>
<P>I therefore now make an addre&s;s in particular to you my fellow-communicants, and fellow-candidates for eter|nal glory. That I may inflame your love, increa&s;e your gratitude, and excite you to give thanks and prai&s;e to the Divine Trinity, "and to walk as you have received the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t," an&s;werable to the de&s;ign of this <HI>eu|chari&s;tical</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="024155_0027_0FC3C8ABD7A0DBD0">
part of my di&s;cour&s;e, it may be u&s;eful to exhibit to your view the infinite obligations you are under to the performance of <HI>the&s;e</HI> and all other duties; and the exerci&s;e of <HI>the&s;e</HI> and all other graces: obligations re&s;ulting from the infinite perfections of God, and his communicative goodne&s;s, and &s;ingular kindne&s;s toward you. But here let me ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that whatever my charitable per&s;ua|&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ward you may be in general, by that which I may now &s;ay, I do not mean to give my &s;anction to your hope that you have received the grace of God. If in our Lord's little family of twelve, there was a <HI>Judas</HI> that betrayed him under the ma&s;k of friend&s;hip, it will be marvellous indeed, if there be not a <HI>traitor</HI> found among hundreds. But as knowing that tho&s;e who come to the <HI>Lord's-&s;upper</HI> in this place, come with a prevailing hope that they have experienced a &s;aving change, I now meet and addre&s;s you on your own ground.&mdash;Ye children of God, his pe|culiar favourites, you have heard "that your times" in every point of view, are in "the hand of your God," therefore make confe&s;&s;ion of this truth with thank&s;giving and prai&s;e. View the kindne&s;s of your God in your admirable formation; "there is a &s;pirit in man, and the in&s;piration of the Almighty giveth him under&s;tanding." You will view the timing of your exi&s;tence and coming into the world, and with gratitude acknowledge the kind|ne&s;s of your God: your lot is ca&s;t in a land of marvellous light, and in a day of abounding grace, by plentiful mea|&s;ures of divine influence. You will often recognize with gratitude the infinite kindne&s;s of the Lord toward you in that he pre&s;erved you in life amid&s;t perils of death, from the moment of your exi&s;tence, for a number of years "when lying in your blood" and guilt, until the fixed time came for your effectual calling. You will remem|ber, that when the Holy Spirit fir&s;t took hold of your heart by way of powerful conviction of your &s;in, guilt, and mi&s;ery, he found you ru&s;hing on toward de&s;truction, and that even <HI>then</HI> when "the arrows of the Almighty

You will often review the more &s;ignal tokens of the Lord's infinite lov|ing-kindne&s;s towards you through all the vici&s;&s;itudes of life &s;ince your fir&s;t &s;aving acquaintance with him. How you have been a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the holy Spirit to exert your graces, and to perform duties &s;piritually and evangeli|cally; and to conform to the divine will, providential and revealed, with a &s;acred plea&s;ure. How you have by the power of divine grace repelled and broke the force of temptation, by &s;atan, the world and the fle&s;h. How when di&s;mal gloom by de&s;ertion over-&s;pread your mind, and tormenting doubts and fears ru&s;hed in upon you, the Lord di&s;pelled your darkne&s;s, and revived your hope and comfort by light divine. How he often enabled you "to cry <HI>Abba Father,</HI>" and often appeared for you as a prayer-hearing God. How he hath upheld and &s;up|ported you under trials and afflictive <HI>ills,</HI> and hath cau&s;ed your con&s;olation to exceed your tribulation. How &s;ome events mo&s;t unpromi&s;ing and adver&s;e in them&s;elves, have by the over-ruling power and love of God &s;erved to pro|mote your temporal and &s;piritual felicity. How when your graces and virtues withered, he noticed your &s;ighs for want of the ab&s;ent <HI>Comforter,</HI> and granted you "fre&s;h anointings, &s;o that your &s;ouls became "as a watered garden."&mdash;How hath the Lord, from time to time ad|mitted you to conver&s;e with him in public ordinances,
<PB N="31" REF="024155_0029_0FC3C8B2FA6F07B8">
and al&s;o met with you in your retirements, both by day and night, in the hou&s;e and by the way, and held divine communion with you. In a word, how have you found upon all occa&s;ions a &s;ufficiency in the grace of God, for doing and &s;uffering his will: &s;o that you have been ready to &s;ay a thou&s;and times, "&s;urely God is good to I&s;rael."

<P>Thus hath the Lord le<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> you on in your way to heaven by his Word and Spirit to this day; and this day hath given a renewed te&s;timony of his infinite kindne&s;s by ad|mitting you to communion with him at the holy <HI>euchari&s;t,</HI> which demands thank&s;giving and prai&s;e. You will now reflect, that this is the Lord's Day, our communion Day, and a new-year's Day.&mdash;Have we not to day, as it were, heard the Lord of love &s;aying unto us, "Come ye chil|dren of my love, I will begin this <HI>new year</HI> with you at a love fea&s;t: as inviting you to behold the Lamb of my election and affection in &s;ufferings, even unto death for the purpo&s;e of your eternal &s;alvation. Here at <HI>my board,</HI> richly furni&s;hed, in and through the Mediator the <HI>Son</HI> of my love, I make over my &s;elf to you in all my infinite perfections, and all my mo&s;t glorious &s;ub&s;i&s;tences, I will be your God, and you &s;hall be my people. By faith a|vouch me to be your God, and the promi&s;es and ble&s;&s;ings of the new covenant are ratified to you by &s;olemn oath, and &s;ealed by &s;acred blood.

We have all indeed occa&s;ion &s;o to do, who are truly the Lord's people and have had &s;uch marvellous &s;ights exhi|bited to view to day. In the holy &s;acrament is to be &s;een the <HI>Lamb</HI> of God &s;lain, and as both able and worthy to open the &s;eals of the everla&s;ting go&s;pel, the book of light and life eternal.&mdash;Here we &s;ee the infinite evil of &s;in in the red gla&s;s of Chri&s;t's &s;ufferings, and by his atonement made for it, even by blood and death:&mdash;here we &s;ee his free, di&s;tingui&s;hing, conde&s;cending, expen&s;ive, &s;trong and everla&s;ting love; and all needful ble&s;&s;ings for time and eternity flowing to us, as believers, in the &s;tream of his precious blood as incarnate God.

religion. Others at this time became the &s;ubjects of &s;ome hope of a &s;aving change. In the la&s;t year, 1791, the work of God among us, claims our remem|brance "as one of the years of the right hand of the mo&s;t high." The Lord "with whom is the re&s;idue of the &s;pirit" has been plea&s;ed to vi&s;it us again with the divine influences. Between thirty and forty have been lately added to the church, more we tru&s;t are on their way about to come, in that many hope they have been the &s;ubjects of this work. The &s;ubjects of this work have been very powerfully wrought upon; and &s;eem to have been uncommonly &s;elected out from among others. This late work has not been &s;o general among &s;inners as u&s;ually we have known. But for a univer&s;al vi&s;ita|tion and fre&s;h anointings of the Lord's people and their increa&s;ing light and comfort, I never know a revival of religion among us equal thereto &s;ince I have been your pa&s;tor.&mdash;It is to be noted and remember'd, that in the intermediate &s;paces of the&s;e plentiful effu&s;ions of the Holy Spirit from fir&s;t to la&s;t there have been &s;ome hope|ful in&s;tances of &s;aving conver&s;ion to God. We have during the whole time enjoyed &s;ome &s;pecial tokens of the Lords gracious pre&s;ence with us. Thus have we &s;een and known &s;ince I have been your pa&s;tor, (exclu|&s;ive of 41-2) four harve&s;t times and &s;ea&s;ons of the plen|tiful out pouring of the Holy Spirit, and times of the flocking of &s;ouls to Chri&s;t, and of acce&s;&s;ions thereupon to his church. I have not heard or known of a people in any department of <HI>Zion</HI> that within the &s;pace of fifty years, have been &s;o frequently favoured with &s;uch plentiful "out pourings of the Holy Spirit" upon them; infinitely vile, unworthy and ungrateful as we are! Having thus briefly reminded you of the infi|nite kindne&s;s of the glorious and eternal Trinity toward us, you will naturally reflect that our obligations to tho&s;e <HI>divine per&s;ons</HI> ri&s;e an&s;werably high; and that our ingratitude will be proportionably aggravated, ba&s;e, and vile.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="024155_0044_0FC3C8D0B682CDB0">
I have now to ob&s;erve, that the Rev. Mr. Hunt|ing, my predece&s;&s;or, and my&s;elf, have between us, com|pleated 92 years in the go&s;pel-mini&s;try in this <HI>place.</HI> That &s;ince my in&s;talment in the year 1746, nine hundred eighty nine per&s;ons have departed life, that belonged to this town&mdash;thirteen of them the year pa&s;t. In the &s;ame &s;pace of time I have baptized in this place &s;ixteen hundred&mdash;45 of them the year pa&s;t: near two hundred more than there are inhabitants at pre&s;ent. When I received this church, it con&s;i&s;ted of 81 members, but three of which are now living. During this time, we have been called to part with many excellent chri&s;ti|ans, rich in experience of divine grace; many of them died in the triumphs of faith, others comfortably. Many valuable chri&s;tians have removed from us into various parts of the country, where, as we hear, they are u&s;eful.&mdash;Numerous heavy breaches and mournful vacancies have been made in this our <HI>Zion;</HI> but the Lord, from time to time, hath filled them all, and more than filled them; "and cau&s;ed joy, rejoicing, thank&s;giving, and the voice of melody to be heard in this city of our God." We have had the acce&s;&s;ion of hundreds to the church: and perhaps the number of communicants was never larger than at the pre&s;ent time. It mu&s;t be re|gi&s;tered in the catalogue of divine favours that I have enjoyed &s;uch a &s;eries of health, that for 44 years I was not &s;o much as once prevented preaching by indi&s;po&s;i|tion, nor had I a &s;ick day or hour during the whole &s;pace of time. Forty-three of tho&s;e years I &s;pent in your &s;ervice; and never to this day have I been pre|vented&mdash;except when for a few &s;abbaths I was debili|tated by the <HI>influenza.</HI> Such an uncommon mea&s;ure of health, but little broke in upon for fifty years, hath been improved for the purpo&s;e of abounding mini&s;terial &s;ervices: I have preached in this &s;pace of time, above ten thou&s;and times. De&s;ignation to office, opportu|nities for mini&s;terial labours, gifts, graces, abilities

more or le&s;s, aids, a&s;&s;i&s;tances and &s;ucce&s;&s;es, are all of and from the Lord; to whom be all the glory. "A man can receive nothing (of this kind), except it be given him from heaven." The Lord as an infinite &s;ove|reign upon his throne, in rai&s;ing up in&s;truments for his &s;ervice, can take them from the ru&s;hes, the &s;heep|folds, or fi&s;h-nets, qualify them for u&s;efulne&s;s, and by them "confound the wi&s;dom of the mighty." If He crowns our feeble attempts in his &s;ervice with any de|gree of &s;ucce&s;s, we wi&s;h to &s;peak of it with undi&s;&s;em|bled gratitude, and with deep aba&s;ement, as con&s;cious of our unworthine&s;s, of our deficiences, and our &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s intermixed with all our performances; and with a &s;pring of joy, that yet a little while, and He will have all the glory of our u&s;efulne&s;s.</P>
<P>Although I have preached abundantly in other places, &s;ince my connexion with you, yet mo&s;tly with you, the people of my &s;pecial charge. With you, my dear peo|ple, I have laboured and travelled in the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try, for a long cour&s;e of years; I may &s;ay it without o&s;tentation, that "I have obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful: I have made it my con&s;tant endeavour and bu&s;ine&s;s to gain &s;ouls to Chri&s;t, and build them up in faith and holine&s;s: principally in&s;i&s;t|ing upon &s;uch truths as expre&s;s the &s;pirit of true reli|gion; and tending to direct, quicken and encourage you in the way to eternal life. I e&s;teem it as one of the pre|cious mercies of the Lord towards me, that I have not "run in vain nor laboured in vain." I have abundant cau&s;e to bow my knee to the Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and ble&s;s his name that I have grounds to hope that he hath made me in&s;trumental of bringing many among you into a &s;aving acquaintance with him&s;elf.&mdash;Although you can ea&s;ily recollect many of the impor|tant capital doctrines which I have mainly in&s;i&s;ted upon in the cour&s;e of my preaching; yet I have prepared therefor, and de&s;igned now to have given you a &s;um|mary
<PB N="48" REF="024155_0046_0FC3C8D74186BB58">
account of them, but the time is elap&s;ed.&mdash;I mu&s;t only &s;ay, "I have not &s;hunned to declare to you the whole coun&s;el of God;" "and have kept back no|thing that is profitable unto you." The apo&s;tolic doct|rines I have preached to you are your crown and glory, as <HI>St. John</HI> &s;peaks, "your crown of twelve &s;tars:" If ever you depart from &s;uch doctrines and let the&s;e truths go, the "crown falls from your head," and the glorious God him&s;elf will depart and be gone; yea, be gone far from a for&s;aken &s;anctuary; and you will &s;ee an <HI>Ichabod</HI> upon the mini&s;try! It is the more needful that I give you warning, and exhort you to become rooted and e&s;tabli&s;hed in the faith, and belief of the truth at pre&s;ent, and thereby become guarded and fortified again&s;t error, becau&s;e you live in a day in which errors abound.</P>
<P>There are preachers and writers in this day, who boldly and freely &s;peak out and publi&s;h errors and prin|ciples, pernicious to the &s;ouls of men: and &s;ome, &s;o artfully, under the &s;pecious &s;hew of &s;anctity, that they would deceive the elect, if that were po&s;&s;ible. The mo&s;t artful &s;educers are tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ert many go&s;pel doctrines, which they &s;uppo&s;e will be plea&s;ing to &s;uch as are &s;ound in the faith, concealing their corrupt prin|ciples, until they &s;uppo&s;e they have &s;ufficiently gain'd intere&s;t in the affections of their hearers, and then they will gradually give vent to them with as much plau|&s;ibility as po&s;&s;ible. You will watch again&s;t verging to "another go&s;pel." and contend earne&s;tly for the &s;aith once delivered to the &s;aints; as knowing that the Holy Spirit co-operates with truth; "and makes the go&s;pel the power of God to every one that believeth."&mdash;But as having preach'd the grand principles of the everla&s;ting go&s;pel to you, I might now naturally put you upon examination and enquiry how you have received and improved them: And ob&s;erve to you, that if any of you continue finally to &s;light and neglect them, your eternal condemnation will be amazingly aggravat|ed;

"your blood will not be required of me;" I &s;hall appear as a witne&s;s again&s;t you before the awful bar of Chri&s;t, our final judge: But the time will not admit to dwell here.&mdash;If it &s;hould plea&s;e the Lord to prolong my life I &s;hall count it worth while to &s;pend the re&s;i|due of my days in promoting the welfare and pro&s;perity of your &s;ouls. Although I do not perceive that pub|lic &s;ervices are now more weari&s;ome than they were thirty years ago, yet, if no acute di&s;ea&s;e invades accord|ing to a cour&s;e of nature I cannot continue your pa&s;tor much longer. For length of time we have had en|dear'd connection as <HI>one,</HI> mutually rejoicing in pro&s;pe|rity; &s;ympathetic in adver&s;ity. I pre&s;ume I am not now preaching my valedictory &s;ermon, however, I take this opportunity to thank you for all your benevolence and kindne&s;&s;es expre&s;&s;ed towards me and mine.&mdash;Who will be my &s;ucce&s;&s;or I know not; though I know what he ought to be in character. I hope, "no grievous wolves will enter in among you, not &s;paring the flock:" Nor "&s;ubtle foxes that &s;poil the tender vines which have grapes:" Nor any that will dare "to li&s;t up their axes upon the carved work of the temple."&mdash;I pray the Lord in infinite mercy to pre&s;erve you from the greate&s;t outward judgment and calamity that can befal you, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that of an unconverted mi|ni&s;try! I have often thought, that could I know this would be your awful <HI>doom,</HI> from love to your &s;ouls, and the &s;ouls of your dear children, I &s;hould grieve my&s;elf down into the grave. I &s;peak the truth, the very thought thereof, gives me a more &s;en&s;ible &s;hock, than the thought of death it&s;elf.&mdash;I &s;hould account it one of the choice&s;t favours in life to &s;ee an a&s;cen|&s;ion gift of our enthroned Saviour Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Lord, conferred upon you, before my departure hence.&mdash;Now you ob&s;erve that all is harmony, love and good-will&mdash;that there is not a &s;eparate, a &s;ectarian, or any one of a different denomination from us in

the boundaries of the town:&mdash;but who can &s;ay it will be <HI>thus,</HI> if after my departure, you are called to the re-&s;ettlement of the go&s;pel mini&s;try among you?&mdash;There may be that concealed in the heart, which as yet is not acted out in the life, for want of time and an&s;werable temptation to draw it forth. Your pre&s;ent outward vi&s;ible harmony, by rea&s;on of an internal dif|ferent ta&s;te and reli&s;h, may be broken in upon, when you come to elect a pa&s;tor, and di&s;cord unhappily pre|vail. Although I thus &s;peak (with a degree of fear) "yet I hope better things." I pre&s;ume you will not take up &s;atisfied with a flouri&s;h of words, and the art of oratory in &s;peaking, if there be wanting, &s;olidity of thought, and apparent &s;olemnity of &s;pirit: Nor with an unconnected, undige&s;ted, and confu&s;ed manner of &s;peaking, with much apparent fervency and little know|ledge. You will wi&s;h to have a mini&s;ter that is "both a burning and &s;hining light;" having knowledge and zeal proportionably a&s;&s;ociated, and both ri&s;ing to a degree of eminency;&mdash;a man of &s;olid judgement, of a fruitful invention, of learned acquirements, and <HI>Paul|ine</HI> in principle;&mdash;endowed with gifts and graces, and furni&s;hed with a fund of doctrinal and experimental knowledge; not preaching up all his divinity in a few &s;ermons; but bringing out of his trea&s;ures things new and old&mdash;"feeding you with knowledge and under|&s;tanding;"&mdash;rightly dividing, and clo&s;ely applying the <HI>word,</HI> giving to &s;inners their portion; and "feeding the &s;heep and lambs of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> as a workman that need not be a&s;hamed:"&mdash;a preacher that does not <HI>divine</HI> for money, (though to be honorably &s;upported) preach|ing Chri&s;t, and wi&s;e to win &s;ouls to him&mdash;powerfully pre&s;&s;ing upon you faith and repentance, and &s;trict con|formity to all divine precepts; but always with evan|gelical references.&mdash;You will a&s;&s;uredly &s;ee to it, that your elect pa&s;tor, both in praying and preaching gives due honour to the Holy Spirit;&mdash;that he frequently

reminds you of the nece&s;&s;ity, the excellency, and ad|vantage of the <HI>Spirit's</HI> mi&s;&s;ion&mdash;that his gracious pre|&s;ence is the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, vital, and fundamental good;&mdash;that where He &s;u&s;pends his influence there will be weakne&s;s, darkne&s;s, and deadne&s;s,&mdash;that where He divinely exerts the powers of his office and the perfections of his nature, there will be light, &s;trength, and life divine.&mdash;And that as a preacher he comes to you in the demon&s;tration of the Spirit and of power.&mdash;May the a&s;cended and exalted Saviour, from his un|wa&s;ted &s;tores and immen&s;e fulne&s;s, confer upon you the royal donative of a &s;piritual pa&s;tor and teacher, "that the Lord God may meet with you in every place, where He has recorded his Name," ble&s;s you, and dwell with you forever!</P>
<P>Finally, brethren, pray for me, (as I hope to for you, 'till my expiring breath) and when I have gotten be|yond the reach of your prayers, I hope you will have occa&s;ion to prai&s;e the Lord for ever, that I was once for a time your mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now conclude in few words.</P>
<P>Having this day entered upon the thre&s;hold of a new year, let us now unite in making the &s;aint's confe&s;&s;ion, Jehovah, "my times are in thy hand."&mdash;Let us offer undi&s;&s;embled prai&s;e to God, that we have life pro|longed to this day.&mdash;Let us al&s;o enter upon this new revolution of time under realizing views of the brevity and uncertainty of life. Nothing is more certain than that our time here will be &s;hort; nothing more uncer|tain than how &s;hort it will be.</P>

It &s;eems that neither revelation, nor providence will let us live long in this world. How &s;hort a duration is there for us on this &s;ide the grave? It is not only po&s;&s;ible, but highly probable, that death may meet &s;ome of us within the compa&s;s of this year. If we could look into the volume of the divine decrees, no doubt, one and another of us would there &s;ee our &s;entence, and the time of its execution fixed&mdash;"this year thou &s;halt die."&mdash;Surely it infinitely concerns each and every one of us to be found in readine&s;s for an exchange of worlds:&mdash;without interpo&s;ing delay to tran&s;act with God through Chri&s;t the divine Mediator relative to our eternal &s;alvation. Suffice it to &s;ay, my dear hearers, (or readers) you mu&s;t remember, always remember, that you were made for God, religion and eternity; and that you mu&s;t have a religion that will befriend you in life, at death, at judgment, and be as la&s;ting as eternity.</P>
<P>In fine&mdash;"whether we live, may we live unto the Lord; or whether we die, may we die unto the Lord; whether we live therefore, or die, may we be the Lord's."</P>
