<P>ADVERTISEMENT&mdash;BY WAY OF APOLOGY.</P>
<P>I HOPE Gen. Allen will pardon any reproach, that may be &s;uppo&s;able, in comparing him to the Pro|digal Son, &s;ent by the Citizen (i. e. the Devil) into his fields to feed &s;wine with hu&s;ks, when he con&s;iders what an infinitely greater reproach he ca&s;ts upon the holy oracles of GOD, and upon his prophets, apo&s;tles and mini&s;ters; and upon the <HI>Lord of life and glory him|&s;elf</HI>; the Saviour and Judge of the world; at who&s;e &s;olemn tribunal we mu&s;t all &s;hortly appear; when he repre&s;ents HIM as an impo&s;tor and cheat, and all the ble&s;&s;ed doctrines of his go&s;pel, as fal&s;ehood and lies.</P>
<P>I have been informed, &s;ince this Sermon was fir&s;t publi&s;hed, that Gen. Allen doth not think him&s;elf fair|ly treated in this way of an&s;wering him, becau&s;e par|ticular &s;entences of his book have not been explicitly quoted and an&s;wered. But in reply to this objection, it may be &s;aid&mdash;that this mu&s;t have been a very ex|pen&s;ive and laborious method, and of no advantage: For many things contained in his book are not di&s;pu|ted, and need no an&s;wer: Others carry their own re|futation in them; &s;uch as his &s;uppo&s;ing there were as many pairs as nations created, and all mankind were not made of one blood; for we have no account of the creation but what is contained in divine revelation; and what he affirms is in oppo&s;ition to that, and hence he affirms without any authority.</P>
<P>And eternal creation is a perfect &s;oleci&s;m; for it &s;uppo&s;es an <HI>eternal effect,</HI> and a <HI>cau&s;e before it</HI>; and &s;o doth eternal generation. And to deny the decrees of

God, is in effect to deny that God is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of infi|nite knowledge, wi&s;dom and benevolence. For if God is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of infinite knowledge, he mu&s;t comprehend in his under&s;tanding all things, and all po&s;&s;ible plans of government: And if he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of infinite wi&s;|dom and benevolence, he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily determine in his own mind, of all po&s;&s;ible plans which is the wi|&s;e&s;t and be&s;t; and this is <HI>forming decrees:</HI> But this doth not imply any <HI>cau&s;ality</HI> in them, or <HI>cau&s;e</HI> any <HI>fix|ed</HI> &s;tate of things; or render means u&s;ele&s;s in produ|cing effects, or de&s;troy blame, or prai&s;e-worthine&s;s, or human liberty, &amp;c. &s;o that Gen. Allen mu&s;t, with the greate&s;t incon&s;equence, draw this inference, That if God hath decreed whatever comes to pa&s;s, mini&s;ters, and means of in&s;truction, are hereby rendered u&s;ele&s;s; &mdash;and it is better to purcha&s;e generous wine, and good old &s;pirits, to chear the heart, than to be at the expence of purcha&s;ing bibles or &s;upporting mini&s;ters. &mdash;And would it not be a u&s;ele&s;s expence of time and pains, ink and paper, to write an&s;wers to &s;uch argu|ments as the&s;e&mdash;with which his book abounds?</P>
<P>And his ob&s;ervations on the formation of Eve&mdash;and on many things contained in Solomon's &s;ongs &mdash;only betray profound ignorance of divine things; and a mind repleni&s;hed with athei&s;m and profanene&s;s&mdash;But, he hath one objection to the divine origin of the holy &s;criptures, that may have a tendency to &s;trengthen the prejudices of <HI>weak</HI> and <HI>wicked</HI> minds again&s;t them; which is to this purpo&s;e, viz. How is the command gi|ven to Saul utterly to de&s;troy the Amalikites&mdash;and the conduct of Samuel in hewing Agag in pieces&mdash; and the declaration made concerning Edom and Ba|bylon&mdash;"Happy &s;hall he be, that taketh and da&s;heth thy little ones again&s;t the &s;tones,"&mdash;con&s;i&s;tent with benevolence? Can that be a revelation from God that commands and approves &s;uch cruelties, and many o|thers recorded in the Old Te&s;tament, and yet enjoins the forgivene&s;s of injuries, and univer&s;al benevolence and charity to all men?&mdash;To this I an&s;wer&mdash;That

the&s;e are fully ju&s;tified by the law of <HI>retaliation,</HI> prac|ticed in all nations, and abundantly warranted in &s;cripture. It is the con&s;tant declaration of the great God him&s;elf, that he will reward every one <HI>according</HI> to his works, and vi&s;it the iniquities of the fathers up|on the children. And this was only treating them as they had treated others; and this is the rea&s;on a&s;&s;ign|ed by the in&s;pired writers in both the&s;e in&s;tances, for their being treated in this manner. And thus was Adon-bezek treated. See Judges 1. 6. 7. And had not God a right to command them to be treated according to their treatment of others? If &s;o, then this can be no rea&s;onable objection again&s;t the divine original of the &s;criptures; but an argument in favour of it.</P>
<P>But I de&s;ire that Gen. Allen, and all the dei&s;ts, be|fore they reject and villify the &s;criptures of in&s;piration, would read&punc; 'A view of the internal evidence of the chri&s;tian religion'&mdash;wrote by Soame Jenyns, E&s;q. wherein he frankly owns to the dei&s;ts that he once be|lieved as little of the chri&s;tian religion as them&s;elves; but on a candid inquiry, he &s;oon &s;ound its pretentions to a &s;upernatural revelation were founded on the mo&s;t &s;olid grounds.</P>
<P>But the principle de&s;ign of the following Sermon is, to convince Gen. Allen, and the Dei&s;ts, that they mi&s;|apply and mi&s;con&s;true, and &s;peak evil of tho&s;e doctrines of &s;cripture to which they have not properly attended, and do not under&s;tand.</P>
<P>I beg the favour that none would be &s;o fooli&s;h and ra&s;h as to judge, condemn, or reject this Sermon, be|fore they have read it through, and are convinced that they well under&s;tand the &s;entiments it contains. If you do, you will affront your humble &s;ervant,</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the beginning of this paragraph, our ble&s;&s;ed Sa|viour tells us, "A certain man had two &s;ons: And the younger &s;aid unto his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living." By the&s;e two &s;ons, we under|&s;tand the whole church of God, con&s;i&s;ting of Jews and Gentitles. By the elder &s;on, we are to under&s;tand that part of the vi&s;ible church, which continued where di|vine revelation was &s;upported. By the younger &s;on, we under&s;tand that part of the church that wandered off from God's hou&s;e, and the re&s;t of the church, till they lo&s;t the means of the knowledge of divine revelation. For by the goods the father divided to his &s;ons, we are to under&s;tand the truths contained in divine revelation, and the means of coming to the knowledge of tho&s;e truths&mdash;and this was the &s;ub&s;tance the younger &s;on wa&s;ted. And the famine that aro&s;e in that land, was a famine of hearing the word of God&mdash;a want of di|vine revelation.</P>
<P>But yet it &s;eems this younger &s;on retained a great de|gree of the light of natural rea&s;on, &s;o that he was able to feed &s;wine, i. e. to in&s;truct others in tho&s;e truths which the light of nature dictated.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="020706_0006_0FB0A4D339570FD8">The Citizen to which he joined him&s;elf, is general|ly thought to be the Devil; who may, with great pro|priety, be called a Citizen; as his kingdom is called the great City&mdash;that is &s;piritually called Sodom and Egypt&mdash;where, al&s;o, our Lord was crucified. Rev xi. 8</P>
<P>THE fields into which he &s;ent him, were tho&s;e parts of the devil's kingdom which were overrun with dark|ne&s;s, error and wickedne&s;s. And he was to teach them the oracles of rea&s;on, or direct them to happine&s;s by the light of nature, and cau&s;e them to re&s;t ea&s;y without di|vine revelation. But the Prodigal was convinced, that rea&s;on, or the light of nature, were not &s;ufficient, without divine revelation, to direct &s;inners in the way to future happine&s;s, in the favour of God. He there|fore began to be in want of a better and more certain rule: But yet he would fain con&s;ider rea&s;on, or the light of nature, &s;ufficient; and endeavoured, by this means, to ea&s;e his con&s;cience and &s;upport his hopes&mdash; this is implied in our text.&mdash;But when he came to him|&s;elf, to &s;et rea&s;on to work, he bethinks him&s;elf of his father's hou&s;e, the church of God, the pillar and ground of truth; and &s;ays, "How many hired &s;ervants of my father have bread enough, and to &s;pare, and I peri&s;h with hunger."</P>
<P>BY this <HI>bread</HI> in his father's hou&s;e, we are to un|der&s;tand the truths contained in divine revelation, in oppo&s;ition to the dim light of nature: And by the hi|red &s;ervants, we are to under&s;tand all tho&s;e who are fa|voured with divine revelation, as a mini&s;tration of the &s;pirit, but yet are not regenerated and made true be|lievers, and the &s;ons of God, by the word and &s;pirit of truth; but are &s;eeking to earn heaven by their obedi|ence to the precepts of the go&s;pel, without depending upon the righteou&s;ne&s;s and grace of Chri&s;t alone for &s;alvation.</P>

<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t. CONSIDER the hu&s;ks here mentioned.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. THE &s;wine that feed on the&s;e hu&s;ks.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3d. WHAT is implied in eating them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>LASTLY, make improvement.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I MEAN to &s;tudy brevity in every part, le&s;t I &s;hould weary your patience, and lo&s;e your attention.</P>
<P>FIRST, then, let me draw your attention to the hu&s;ks here mentioned.</P>
<P>BY the&s;e hu&s;ks (as we before ob&s;erved) we are to under&s;tand the dictates of the light of nature, or the oracles of rea&s;on, when &s;ub&s;tituted as a &s;ufficient rule to direct <HI>&s;inners</HI> to future happine&s;s, in the room of di|vine revelation.</P>
<P>I WOULD by no means &s;ay any thing to depreciate the value of rea&s;on; for unle&s;s we were endowed with the noble faculty of under&s;tanding, by which we are rendered capable of rea&s;oning, judging and determi|ning in matters of religion, divine revelation could be of no advantage to us: We could not be the &s;ubjects of law, or be influenced by threatnings or promi&s;es, by rewards or puni&s;hments. Rea&s;on gives us an eleva|tion of mind above the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h.</P>
<P>BUT rea&s;on never was given for a rule in matters of religion: But the <HI>will</HI> of God, our creator, is the only rule; and when known, every intelligent creature, as he is imperfect in knowledge and wi&s;dom, is under in|finite obligations to yield an implicit obedience to it, however incon&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on the matter of com|mand may appear to them.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="020706_0008_0FB0A4D62293A770">SOME have &s;uppo&s;ed that the imperfection of know|ledge and wi&s;dom, in created intelligences, alleviates or excu&s;es their &s;in, and dimini&s;hes their blame; but it is evident, that their imperfection of knowledge and wi&s;dom, which renders them incapable of &s;elf-govern|ment, increa&s;es their obligation to put an <HI>implicit</HI> con|fidence in the wi&s;dom, an <HI>implicit</HI> faith in the word, and yield an <HI>implicit</HI> obedience to the known command of their all-wi&s;e and benevolent Creator. And this infinitely increa&s;es our &s;in and folly in leaning to our own rea&s;on and under&s;tanding, or hearkening to the temptations of &s;atan, or tru&s;ting in our own heart, &s;o as to reject the word, and tran&s;gre&s;s a known command of our all-wi&s;e and benevolent Creator. In this con|&s;i&s;ted the infinite evil of original &s;in in angels and men &mdash;It was a rejecting the revealed word of God and the divine government over us, and &s;etting up the &s;ugge&s;|tions of the devil, or our own rea&s;on, in the room of the <HI>known will</HI> of our Creator, and not putting an <HI>im|plicit</HI> confidence in his wi&s;dom and benevolence.</P>
<P>THE de&s;ign of rea&s;on is not to be a rule it&s;elf, but only a mean to come to the knowledge of the <HI>word</HI> or <HI>will</HI> of God; and not a rule by which to mea&s;ure them.</P>
<P>HATH God made a revelation of his <HI>will</HI> to us, and &s;hall we di&s;pute the rea&s;onablene&s;s or the righteou&s;ne&s;s of his commands, and refu&s;e to believe and obey, be|cau&s;e they are not level to our rea&s;on? Shall we, who are &s;o imperfect in our knowledge and wi&s;dom, reject the known laws of our all-wi&s;e Creator, and &s;et up for &s;elf-government? The light of nature, and oracles of rea&s;on, when &s;et up for a rule in oppo&s;ition to the ora|cles of God, contained in divine revelation, are hu&s;ks, on which none but &s;wine do feed.</P>
<P>BUT the truths contained in divine revelation are bread for the &s;oul; yea, angels food! and received by
<PB N="9" REF="020706_0009_0FB0A4D860A281E8">
faith and love by &s;inners, they &s;trengthen, nouri&s;h and rai&s;e to eternal life! But con&s;ider our&s;elves as &s;inners, in a &s;tate of rebellion to our Creator, and can all the oracles of rea&s;on di&s;cover to us the will of God, or a way for our pardon and &s;alvation? Who can know that God will pardon men rather than devils, and on what terms he will pardon, unle&s;s God him&s;elf makes it known to us by immediate revelation?</P>
<P>SECOND, Let us con&s;ider the Swine that feed on the&s;e hu&s;ks.</P>
<P>AND the&s;e I take to be Pagans, Dei&s;ts, Infidels, and all who deny the divine original and authority of the holy &s;criptures, and &s;ub&s;titute the light of nature, and the oracles of rea&s;on, or the dictates of con&s;cience, in the room of them.</P>
<P>OF the&s;e we have a famous, or rather infamous Swine, in Julian the Apo&s;tate, who had been a pro|fe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tian, but fell from chri&s;tianity and turned Pagan or Dei&s;t, and u&s;ed his utmo&s;t endeavours to over|throw the chri&s;tian church; and became a mo&s;t noto|rious per&s;ecutor of the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, and the chri&s;tians; and as is thought, again&s;t his own light. He u&s;ed to call Chri&s;t, by way of reproach, the Gali|lean. The la&s;t words he uttered at his death were,&mdash; "Thou ha&s;t overcome, O Galilean!"&mdash;And he is commonly thought by divines, to have committed the unpardonable &s;in.</P>
<P>AND of the &s;ame number are all Dei&s;ts, who wholly ca&s;t off the chri&s;tian religion and are profe&s;&s;ed infidels, &mdash;"They deny the whole chri&s;tian religion. In|deed they own the being of a God, but they deny that Chri&s;t was the &s;on of God; and &s;ay that he was a meer cheat; and &s;o they &s;ay all the Prophets and Apo&s;tles were; and they deny the whole &s;cripture: They deny
<PB N="10" REF="020706_0010_0FB0A4DE033A33D0">
that any of it is the word of God? They deny that there is any revealed religion, or any word of God at all; and &s;ay that God hath given mankind no other light to walk by, but their own rea&s;on."</P>
<P>AND though it is manife&s;t they are beholden to the light of divine revelation for all their &s;y&s;tems of moral philo&s;ophy, and all the &s;en&s;e that is contained in their oracles of rea&s;on; yet they de&s;pi&s;e it, and declare it to be needle&s;s; and in&s;i&s;t upon the &s;ufficiency of their own rea&s;on to direct them to happine&s;s without it. But in this they re&s;emble the country clown, who &s;aid, "We &s;hould be obliged to the &s;un if it would &s;hine in the night, but we have light enough in the day with|out it."</P>
<P>LET the&s;e men look for &s;y&s;tems of moral philo&s;ophy, and oracles of rea&s;on, among the Hottentots, the Af|ricans, and the aboriginals of this land, w<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">e the rays of divine revelation have never darted any light.</P>
<P>THIRD, We proceed to con&s;ider what is implied in eating the&s;e hu&s;ks.</P>
<P>EATING, in the literal &s;en&s;e of the word, implies, or pre&s;uppo&s;es, that we have the knowledge of the food &mdash;that we have a ta&s;te and reli&s;h for it&mdash;that we are delighted with it&mdash;that we receive it &s;o as to make it our own&mdash;that it incorporates, and is rendered one with the body&mdash;that it nouri&s;hes and &s;upports, and &s;trengthens the body, and maintains its life, &s;pirits and vigour, and animates to action.</P>
<P>AND in this manner it may, with great propriety, be &s;aid, that <HI>intellectual &s;wine</HI> feed on the&s;e hu&s;ks. They obtain the knowledge of the&s;e productions of darkne&s;s, error and wickedne&s;s, formed in the devil's kingdom: They have a ta&s;te and reli&s;h for them&mdash;they
<PB N="11" REF="020706_0011_0FB0A4E1509CBB38">
are delighted with them&mdash;they receive them by faith and love, &s;o as to make them their own&mdash;they are in|corporated and rendered one with their &s;ouls&mdash;they ea&s;e their con&s;ciences, nouri&s;h, &s;upport and &s;trenth|en their delu&s;ive hopes, and maintain their life and vigour, in infidelity and wickedne&s;s&mdash;and animate them to action in building up the devil's kingdom, and in bla&s;pheming God, de&s;pi&s;ing his word, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing his laws, rebelling again&s;t his wi&s;e and righteous go|vernment; and privily bringing in damnable here|&s;ies; even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon them&s;elves &s;wift de&s;truction&mdash;And many &s;hall follow their pernicious ways, by rea&s;on of whom the way of truth &s;hall be evil &s;poken of. See ii Pet. 2.1.</P>
<P>THIS prophecy being fulfilled at this day, is a &s;trong argument for the divine original and authority of the &s;acred &s;criptures.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="improvement">

<P>AND this &s;hall be by way of earne&s;t exhortation to all my hearers, or readers, not to &s;eek to fill their bellies with the hu&s;ks that the &s;wine do eat, but repair to their father's hou&s;e, where they will find bread enough and to &s;pare; and by faith and love re|ceive and feed on tho&s;e heavenly dainties, tho&s;e truths which are good, and let their &s;ouls delight them&s;elves in fatne&s;s.</P>
<P>GEN. ETHAN ALLEN, hath of late been at great pains and co&s;t to write a book to little good pur|po&s;e, but to tell the world that he is a prophane, prayerle&s;s, gracele&s;s infidel. I once gave it a cur&s;ory reading; but as I have it not by me at pre&s;ent, I pur|po&s;e not to enter into any particular con&s;ideration of his arguments, or the prophane flouts he ca&s;ts upon the &s;acred oracles of God. He may hereafter find that he hath done this to his eternal co&s;t, unle&s;s true re|pentance, and faith in that Saviour which he de&s;pi&s;es, prevents.</P>
<P>BUT my de&s;ign, in order to di&s;&s;uade all men of &s;en&s;e from attending to the&s;e hu&s;ks, is to point out &s;ome of the foundation errors, which being obviated, the &s;u|per&s;tructure mu&s;t fall to the ground.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="020706_0013_0FB0A4E3A59E7A58">AND the fir&s;t foundation error that I &s;hall mention, in which he betrays a &s;wini&s;h ignorance is, his not ma|king a proper di&s;tinction between the <HI>e&s;&s;ence</HI> and <HI>will</HI> of God. Hence, in creation, he doth not con&s;ider the Divine Being as producing this great work, in which &s;uch infinite wi&s;dom, power, benevolence and <HI>de&s;ign,</HI> is manife&s;ted, by the word of his power, or by the free act of his will, under the influence of infinite wi&s;dom, benevolence and coun&s;el: But he con&s;iders the creation as proceeding from the e&s;&s;ence of God, without any wi&s;dom or de&s;ign of his, by an eternal nece&s;&s;ary ema|nation.</P>
<P>AND hence he makes the futile di&s;tinction between creation and formation, as if the <HI>will</HI> of God, in a cour&s;e of nature, produced the latter, but not the for|mer.</P>
<P>AND hence he con&s;iders the divine government as a fixed cour&s;e of nature, not under the direction of an all-wi&s;e, all-powerful benevolent Being! po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of perfect liberty, and able every moment to alter the cour&s;e of nature as he plea&s;es, without increa&s;ing his own knowledge, or altering his mind or purpo&s;es, but as under the influence of blind fatal nece&s;&s;ity; &s;o that according to his idea, prayer, and all other means, are rendered u&s;ele&s;s in the divine government, becau&s;e the fates are inflexible; which &s;eems to be his idea of <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>AND his idea of the decrees of God is very gro&s;s. He makes no di&s;tinction between <HI>forming</HI> and <HI>executing</HI> a decree. The ble&s;&s;ed God, in forming his decrees, had, in his infinite under&s;tanding, a clear ordination or arrangement of all things, into all po&s;&s;ible plans; and under the influence of infinite wi&s;dom and benevo|lence, he determined in eternity, in his own mind, of all po&s;&s;ible plans, which is the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t. This I take to be <HI>forming</HI> a decree.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="020706_0014_0FB0A4E5984AF2C8">BUT this <HI>determination,</HI> of all po&s;&s;ible plans, which is the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t, doth not execute any plan, cre|ate a world, or produce any effect, or make God the Author of &s;in or any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>GOD's forming decrees in his own eternal mind, in eternity, is very different from the execution of them in time, and doth by no means imply the <HI>eternal</HI> exi&s;t|ence of tho&s;e things which were in eternity, ordained or arranged in the divine knowledge and under&s;tanding &mdash;if it does, then all created exi&s;tences are coeval with the divine exi&s;tence; which mu&s;t appear fal&s;e and ab|&s;urd at the fir&s;t blu&s;h.</P>
<P>NONE but God him&s;elf could form his decrees in eternity; but angels, men and devils, execute many of them in time. And it is no impeachment of the divine wi&s;dom and power to &s;ay, that God never could execute the decrees he hath formed, according to his own plan, without angels, and men and devils, and &s;econd cau&s;es; &s;uch as human ideas, perceptions, vo|litions, prayers, and other actions that depend upon the free will of creatures; becau&s;e the&s;e &s;econd cau&s;es were con&s;idered in his plan in eternity; and the&s;e be|ing left out in the execution, it would not be the exe|cution of God's eternal decrees, but &s;ome other plan.</P>
<P>AND the eternal decrees of God, have not the lea&s;t influence on the mind of man, in forming his de&s;igns, or inclining him to action by way of efficiency or mo|tive, any more than if there were no decrees formed. They do not deprive man of any liberty, or take away any blame. And in directing the cour&s;e of nature, and in overruling all things, God acts as a being per|fectly free, without the lea&s;t nece&s;&s;ity, but what is with|in him&s;elf&mdash;his own wi&s;dom and benevolence.</P>
<P>AND he determined from all eternity, to alter the
<PB N="15" REF="020706_0015_0FB0A4E6D4AC4068">
cour&s;e of things ju&s;t as he plea&s;es, in an&s;wer to prayer; and he can alter the cour&s;e of nature by miracles, without increa&s;ing his knowledge, or changing his de|crees. And General Allen &s;eems to deny that God is a free agent, but is under a fatal nece&s;&s;ity to act with|out any wi&s;dom or de&s;ign. And though he &s;ays &s;ome things well, upon the free and moral agency of man; yet, in treating on that &s;ubject, he di&s;covers he is very deficient in philo&s;ophy: For he does not tell us what con&s;titutes a moral agent: He gives us no account of the three faculties of the &s;oul, <HI>under&s;tanding, principle</HI> and <HI>will,</HI> as di&s;tinct from its exerci&s;es. And how the under&s;tanding differs from the other faculties, as it is the &s;eat of ideas and &s;peculative knowledge, and not of moral perception or volition&mdash;And that the <HI>will</HI> cannot be the &s;eat of &s;peculative knowledge or moral ta&s;te, but only of volition; but the power of percep|tion, or moral ta&s;te, mu&s;t be alone &s;eated in the <HI>prin|ciple</HI>; and this being right, lays a foundation for holy and righteous exerci&s;es, but being corrupted, lays a foundation for &s;inful exerci&s;es in the will;&mdash;and &s;in con&s;i&s;ts radically in hating the true character of God, and in loving or embracing a fal&s;e or erroneous cha|racter of God, when formed in the under&s;tanding&mdash; and holine&s;s or righteou&s;ne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in loving or em|bracing the truth, and acting in conformity to it.</P>
<P>IN &s;peaking again&s;t the &s;cripture doctrine of a tri|nity of per&s;ons, or agents exi&s;ting in the divine e&s;&s;ence, he &s;peaks evil of that which he under&s;tands not any more than a &s;wine.</P>
<P>THAT three di&s;tinct per&s;ons, or agents, &s;hould exi&s;t eternally and nece&s;&s;arily in one infinite e&s;&s;ence, and yet be di&s;tinct in their agency and operations, is no more repugnant to rea&s;on, than that one agent &s;hould exi&s;t from eternity infinite in his e&s;&s;ence and perfec|tions, and yet limitted in his agency and operations
<PB N="16" REF="020706_0016_0FB0A4E82880BE70">
by his own wi&s;dom and will&mdash;for all mu&s;t grant, that although God is infinite in his e&s;&s;ence and perfections, yet he limits him&s;elf in his agency and operations&mdash; his exertions of power are limitted by his wi&s;dom and will; otherwi&s;e, God's works would be as infinite as God him&s;elf&mdash;which is a glaring ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>AND why may not three di&s;tinct agents depend on one e&s;&s;ence for their exi&s;tence and operations, as well as thou&s;ands of di&s;tinct agents depend on one will (the will of God) for their exi&s;tence and power of opera|tion? The &s;econd per&s;on in the &s;acred trinity doth not depend on his own will or act, or on the will or act of the fir&s;t or third per&s;on for his exi&s;tence&mdash;nor do either of them depend on the will or act of each other, or their own, for their exi&s;tence; but all exi&s;t nece&s;&s;ari|ly, in one infinite eternal e&s;&s;ence; and in this they differ from creatures, who depend on the will and act of God for their exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>AND all he &s;ays about the eternal generation of the &s;on is futile, and is in direct oppo&s;ition to the argu|ments he u&s;es in favour of eternal creation. In &s;crip|ture, the &s;econd per&s;on in the &s;acred trinity is called the <HI>prototoros</HI>; rendered, <HI>fir&s;t born,</HI> or <HI>fir&s;t begotten</HI> in our tran&s;lation; but according to the mo&s;t judicious critics, &s;hould have been rendered, the fir&s;t <HI>progenitor, producer,</HI> or father of every creature. "For by him (&s;ays the in&s;pired writer) were all things created that are in heaven and on earth, vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible&mdash;And he is before all things, and by him all things con&s;i&s;t." See Col. i. 15, 16, 17.</P>
<P>AND the &s;econd per&s;on, or the eternal <HI>logos,</HI> being &s;poken of as a <HI>&s;on,</HI>&mdash;an only begotten or fir&s;t begotten &s;on&mdash; as one brought up with the father, and daily his delight&mdash;I take to be only figurative expre&s;&s;ions, to &s;et forth the perfection of their happine&s;s: For happi|ne&s;s
<PB N="17" REF="020706_0017_0FB0A4E9ABAF9FD0">
lies not in &s;olitude but &s;ociety; and the &s;acred trinity mu&s;t have enjoyed infinite delight, commu|nion, complacency and happine&s;s in them&s;elves before any creature exi&s;ted. See Prov. 8, 30.</P>
<P>AND the hypo&s;tatical union, when rightly under|&s;tood, is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on as well as &s;cripture. For the &s;econd per&s;on in the trinity to cre|ate a man with &s;oul and body, and &s;o cloath it with the moral perfections of the divine nature, as to give it the character of a divine per&s;on, and one with him|&s;elf, &s;o as to put the divine character, as moral Go|vernor, into the power of his enemies; and con&s;iders all their &s;pite and enmity to truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and all their reproaches and cruelties acted out again&s;t this <HI>Theanthropos,</HI> as acted out again&s;t the character of God him&s;elf, as moral Governor of the univer&s;e, is by no means repugnant to rea&s;on, is a wonderful di&s;play of infinite wi&s;dom and power, in giving opportunity to &s;inners to act out the infinite evil of &s;in as oppo&s;ed to God's moral character, law and government&mdash;and to convince them of the <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and righteou&s;ne&s;s of the divine threatening.</P>
<P>AND all the doctrines our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour taught, and all the miracles he wrought, &s;hew that God was with him, and that he did ri&s;e from the dead by his own divine power. He had power to lay down his life and power to re&s;ume it again; and no man had power to take it from him again&s;t his will. No truths can come better atte&s;ted than the&s;e. And to deny that there can be any miracles, is to deny that God is po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of infinite wi&s;dom, power and liberty to alter the cour&s;e of nature as he plea&s;es; but that the ble&s;&s;ed God, and all his volitions and operations, are &s;ubject|ed to a fatal nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>GEN. Allen labours exceedingly to oppo&s;e the &s;crip|ture
<PB N="18" REF="020706_0018_0FB0A4EB4C779EB0">
doctrine of the &s;ub&s;titution of the innocent to &s;uf|fer for the guilty, and the imputation of merit and de|merit. But how he came by his idea of this doctrine, doth not appear; for I am &s;ure it is not contained in the bible: And to impute the mi&s;taken notions of fal|lible men, and their corrupt explanations of the &s;crip|tures, to the &s;criptures them&s;elves, and then vilify and reproach the &s;criptures, as containing &s;uch ab&s;urd unrea&s;onable doctrines, is very unfair.</P>
<P>IF I believed that many doctrines, as held by &s;ome we call orthodox divines, were contained in the &s;crip|tures, I &s;hould &s;cruple their divine original and autho|rity: For &s;uch doctrines as &s;ome hold them, are, in my opinion, unworthy of a God of infinite wi&s;dom and righteou&s;ne&s;s. But we mu&s;t under&s;tand the &s;criptures them&s;elves, and the doctrines contained in them, be|fore we reject and vilify them.</P>
<P>THE holy &s;criptures no where, as I can find, &s;up|po&s;e, that criminality can be imputed or transferred from one to another&mdash;nor can an innocent per&s;on be &s;o &s;ub&s;tituted as to become the object or victim of the divine wrath and di&s;plea&s;ure, or &s;uffer the individual penalty or puni&s;hment threatened to the guilty, con&s;i&s;t|ent with rea&s;on or ju&s;tice: But an innocent per&s;on may undertake, and with his own con&s;ent be &s;ub&s;tituted, to <HI>an&s;wer</HI> for the guilty, by paying the price of his re|demption or ran&s;om, by di&s;charging a debt, or making good the damages to the injured, &s;o that the merit of the innocent per&s;on may avail for the pardon and di&s;|charge of the guilty or criminal, from the penalty or puni&s;hment, con&s;i&s;tent with the honour of the charac|ter, law and government of the injured prince or ruler. And this is common among men, that a glorious, in|nocent, worthy per&s;on, &s;hould in &s;uch a ca&s;e become a mediator, and &s;urety and advocate for the guilty, who hath forfeited his liberty, life and inheritance,
<PB N="19" REF="020706_0019_0FB0A4ECA920BF60">
and by his arduous &s;ervices and great &s;ufferings, bring that honour to the injured prince, and that intere&s;t to his kingdom, as might purcha&s;e a pardon and redemp|tion for the guilty&mdash;and this is vicarious &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>FOR in&s;tance, we will &s;uppo&s;e, in the time of the late conte&s;t, that Gen. Allen was a great and worthy friend of his country: He hath a number of &s;ons that become enemies to his country, and join the Britons to conquer and de&s;troy it: According to a law of this empire they are condemned to death. Gen. Allen hath a great af|fection to his &s;ons, and de&s;ires their &s;alvation, if it can be obtained con&s;i&s;tent with the rights of government. At the appointment of Congre&s;s, and with his own con|&s;ent, he is &s;ub&s;tituted to undertake the war at his own expence. He engages the enemies of his country, and is fir&s;t made a victim by them; and they &s;acrifice, for a time, his liberty, his ea&s;e and honour, and all his wealth, and he faces death in all its formidable &s;hapes&mdash;and his &s;ufferings are extremely great&mdash;more bitter than death it&s;elf, and his &s;ervices arduous. But yet he, by this means, finally overcomes all his ene|mies, and puts an end to the war. His &s;ons are now convinced, that their enmity and oppo&s;ition to their worthy father, and the laws and government of the empire, are unrea&s;onable and vile; the puni&s;hment threatened ju&s;t, and the threatening ought to be verified, notwith&s;tanding their repentance; becau&s;e the honour of government mu&s;t be &s;upported.</P>
<P>WHEN they are called before the tribunal to receive their &s;entence according to law; the General, their worthy father, &s;teps in as their mediator, &s;urety and advocate&mdash;&s;hews his wounds that he hath received in the cau&s;e of his country, and pleads his expence of ho|nour, blood and trea&s;ure, and all his humiliation, ar|duous &s;ervices, and great &s;ufferings, and the honour hereby brought to the rulers, laws, and government,
<PB N="20" REF="020706_0020_0FB0A4EE464368A8">
and good to the empire; and if by all the&s;e he hath merited any thing of his country, he may receive the pardon of his penitent &s;ons as his reward.&mdash;The Con|gre&s;s pardon them freely of their own grace, on ac|count of the merit that is in their father; which is a proper merit of condignity with the Congre&s;s. This I take to be the &s;cripture &s;en&s;e of &s;ub&s;titution, vicari|ous &s;ufferings, and the imputation of merit. Is this repugnant to rea&s;on, ju&s;tice, common &s;en&s;e, or the u&s;a|ges of nations?</P>
<P>BUT had Gen. Allen been &s;ub&s;tituted to bear the penalty, in order to redeem his &s;ons, and &s;o been hang|ed, and his &s;ons relea&s;ed from the threatened puni&s;h|ment on the account of his &s;uffering it; would this be con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice, rea&s;on or common &s;en&s;e? But Gen. Allen doth not redeem his &s;ons by &s;uffering the penalty, but by paying the price of their redemption, by his &s;ervices and &s;ufferings. And though he doth not purcha&s;e the benevolence or grace of the Congre&s;s to his &s;ons; yet he opens a way for them to exerci&s;e it con&s;i&s;tent with the rights of government; which they would not have done, had it not have been for the merit of their father. But hanging Gen. Allen in his &s;ons &s;tead, would not have &s;upported the honour of the law and government, in the &s;ame manner as they are &s;upported by his &s;ervices and &s;ufferings in the cau&s;e, and for the good of the empire.</P>
<P>AND as to the imputation of demerit, &s;uppo&s;e a man of great wealth and honour, and high in the fa|vour of his country&mdash;and having a numerous family of &s;mall children, and many yet to be born with his wife &mdash;turns enemy to his country, and according to a law of the empire, his whole e&s;tate is confi&s;cated, and they with their families are bani&s;hed their country, and de|prived of all the privileges and immunities of it. He removes with his family into another kingdom, who&s;e
<PB N="21" REF="020706_0021_0FB0A4EFC75B77F8">
prince is a &s;worn enemy to the righteous laws and good government of this empire, and trains up his children in enmity and oppo&s;ition to the righteous government of this land&mdash;and there they live and die in darkne&s;s, error and wickedne&s;s, and in extreme poverty, all in con&s;equence of their parents conduct. Will General Allen condemn the law of this empire, by which this man and his family was bani&s;hed, and his e&s;tate confi&s;|cated, as unrea&s;onable and unju&s;t?</P>
<P>AND as to Gen. Allen's de&s;cription of the objects of Faith, I under&s;tand he is convinced him&s;elf that he hath made &s;uch gro&s;s blunders, that there needs a &s;up|plement to his Oracles of Rea&s;on, in order to correct them; and I leave him and the &s;wine he feeds to cook that di&s;h.</P>
<P>I THINK I have &s;aid enough to di&s;&s;uade all rea&s;on|able people, that would con&s;ult their own honour and be&s;t intere&s;t, from &s;eeking to fill their belly with the&s;e hu&s;ks.</P>
<P>I WOULD now endeavour to per&s;uade all to leave the&s;e hu&s;ks, and repair to their father's hou&s;e, where there is bread enough and to &s;pare, le&s;t they peri&s;h with hunger, yea, peri&s;h to all eternity, in the land of darkne&s;s, error and wickedne&s;s, in &s;atan's king|dom; where they will be &s;o de&s;titute of all relief as not to have a drop of water to cool their tongue.</P>
<P>AND O, be prevailed upon to attend to the oracles of divine truth without prejudice, and &s;eek fir&s;t to ob|tain the knowledge of the&s;e truths, as contained in di|vine revelation, and a right under&s;tanding of there, and then receive them, and feed upon them with faith and love, and you will find the word of the Lord will be unto you the joy and rejoicing of your heart &mdash; The truths contained in divine revelation are infinite|ly
<PB N="22" REF="020706_0022_0FB0A4F141D24F00">
more precious than pearls. O be not like the &s;wine, who trample them under their feet, and turn again and rent &s;uch as pre&s;ent them, for mocking them with pearls in&s;tead of hu&s;ks. The Dei&s;ts would per&s;uade you not to attend to the oracles of God, becau&s;e there is danger that they are corrupted by length of time, and being frequently tran&s;lated and tran&s;cribed. And they have many other objections; all which may be ea&s;ily an&s;wered, and have been an&s;wered a thou&s;and times. But the principal objection in their mind is, they do not love the truths therein contained: Their &s;ore eyes cannot bear the light, which condemns their heart and conduct. They hate truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the inflexible ju&s;tice of God, and love darkne&s;s, error and wickedne&s;s; and therefere will not come to the light of revealed truth, le&s;t their deeds &s;hould be reproved, and it be made manife&s;t that they are in the kingdom of the devil, and going down to hell, to &s;uffer the ju&s;t penalty of di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>BUT the principal truths contained in divine reve|lation, &s;peak for them&s;elves; and it mu&s;t appear to all that under&s;tand them, that they are not corrupted, but afford clear evidence that they are from God. And were we to take only a cur&s;ory view of the principal truths contained in divine revelation, we mu&s;t be con|vinced, that there is no e&s;&s;ential corruption of tho&s;e &s;a|cred volumes, but that they now contain pure truths &s;ufficient to guide every benighted &s;oul to happine&s;s, who will but obtain the true knowledge and under&s;tand|ing of them, receive them with faith and love, and make them the only rule of their faith and manners, and conform their hearts and lives to them. And there is no book on earth contains &s;uch a full and compleat a &s;y&s;tem of theology.&mdash;The&s;e volumes contain in them a clear account of the eternal exi&s;tence of one &s;upreme God, in three di&s;tinct per&s;ons united in one e&s;&s;ence, independent on their own <HI>will,</HI> or the will or act of
<PB N="23" REF="020706_0023_0FB0A4F29DFC3D30">
each other, for their exi&s;tence. And this God is po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of all po&s;&s;ible perfections, both natural and mo|ral&mdash;and doth from eternity to eternity comprehend, in his infinite under&s;tanding, all things po&s;&s;ible&mdash;and of all po&s;&s;ible plans of government, his will, under the influence of infinite wi&s;dom and benevolence, deter|mines which is the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t. And in the exe|cution of this plan, he created the heavens and the earth, and all their numerous ho&s;ts of creatures. An|gels and men, he made free moral agents, endowed with <HI>under&s;tanding, principle</HI> and <HI>will</HI>; capable of thinking, perceiving, rea&s;oning, judging and chu&s;ing&mdash;and &s;o &s;ubjects of moral law and government, capable of knowing, loving and &s;erving their Creator.&mdash;And the oracles of God contain a mo&s;t compendious and com|pleat &s;y&s;tem of moral precepts, compri&s;ing our duty to God, our&s;elves, and one another&mdash;and both the fir&s;t and &s;econd table &s;ummed up in love to God and our neighbour.</P>
<P>THE oracles of God do not place religion in ab|&s;tru&s;e &s;peculation, and mere metaphy&s;ical &s;ubtilties&mdash; not in outward &s;how and tedious ceremony&mdash;not in &s;uper&s;titious au&s;terities, and in enthu&s;ia&s;tic vi&s;ion and impul&s;es;&mdash;but in love to God and our neighbour, and purity of heart and holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s of life.&mdash; Only con&s;ider what a &s;y&s;tem of morality is contained in the decalogue. Where will you find one equal to it in all the Heathen writers who were unacquainted with it?&mdash;But divine revelation is not merely a re|fined &s;y&s;tem of morality; but it contains a &s;tupendous plan of providence, de&s;igned for the recovery of man|kind from a &s;tate of guilt and ruin to the favour of God, and the hopes of a happy immortality through a Mediator. For herein we are taught that &s;ome of the angels apo&s;tati&s;ed from God, and fell under his di&s;plea&s;ure and the penalty threatened to the di&s;obe|dient, and were doomed to hell, in a confirmed &s;tate of wickedne&s;s and mi&s;ery, under the wrath and cur&s;e of God for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="020706_0024_0FB0A4F423EFB500">UPON this there commenced a grand moral conte&s;t between heaven and hell, concerning the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God as moral Governor. The devil &s;et him&s;elf to oppo&s;e God, not by natural power or force, but in tho&s;e things in which the nature of virtue and vice, and the very e&s;&s;ence of moral government require, that moral agents &s;hould not be over-ruled and influ|enced by irre&s;i&s;table force and divine efficiency, as God governs the material world; but by manife&s;tation of truth to their minds&mdash;by in&s;tructions and motives &mdash;by laws containing promi&s;es and threatenings, re|wards and puni&s;hments. This conte&s;t is of a <HI>moral</HI> kind&mdash;the devil doth not contend with the Almighty for the <HI>natural</HI> kingdom or dominion of the univer&s;e; but he oppo&s;es God by oppo&s;ing his truth and righte|ou&s;ne&s;s. And the kingdom of the devil is founded in darkne&s;s, error and wickedne&s;s, in oppo&s;ition to God's moral kingdom&mdash;founded in light, truth and righte|ou&s;ne&s;s. The devil cannot be conquered in a moral &s;en&s;e by natural force, even by Omnipotence. The devil, by his erroneous rea&s;onings concerning the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, deceived, and &s;o induced our fir&s;t parents to tran&s;gre&s;s a plain, po&s;itive command of their Creator; and by this means brought them and all their po&s;terity into his kingdom.</P>
<P>ALL created intelligencies being imperfect in their knowledge and wi&s;dom, are unfit for &s;elf-government, and &s;o mu&s;t be under infinite obligation to put an <HI>im|plicit</HI> confidence in the wi&s;dom and benevolence, an <HI>im|plicit</HI> faith in the word, and yield an <HI>implicit</HI> obedience to the known command of their Creator; as they can|not but be rationally convinced that God is all-wi&s;e and infinitely benevolent. And to tran&s;gre&s;s a com|mand, is the breach of an infinite obligation, and pregnant with infinite mi&s;chief to the divine govern|ment.

And this emboldened them to par|take of that fruit that they &s;aw plea&s;ant to the eyes, good for food, and to be de&s;ired to make one wi&s;e; contrary to the known command of their all-wi&s;e and infinitely benevolent Creator. They fir&s;t, under the influence of the devil's beguiling and deceiving them by his erroneous rea&s;onings, di&s;believe the truth of the threatening, and then tran&s;gre&s;s the command; notwith&s;tanding their infinite obligation to put an im|plicit faith in God's word, and yield an implicit obe|dience to his known command, and their love to his moral character. This tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of our fir&s;t parents involved them in death, temporal and &s;piritual, and eternal; which was the threatened penalty: by this tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion they forfeited their own and their po&s;te|rity's liberty, life and inheritance of glory and felici|ty: For this they were bani&s;hed the favourable pre|&s;ence of their Creator, totally deprived of the vital influences of the holy &s;pirit, and the rectitude of their moral principle; and left of God to &s;uffer all the na|tural and moral con&s;equences of their apo&s;tacy in the devil's kingdom, under the power of darkne&s;s, igno|rance and error and wickedne&s;s; under the wrath and cur&s;e of God, the power of &s;in, and the tyranny of &s;a|tan, forever.</P>
<P>BUT the &s;econd per&s;on in the adorable Trinity, en|gaged to be a mediator, &s;urety and advocate in behalf of man; and engaged to fulfil all righteou&s;ne&s;s, and to procure &s;uch an infinite fountain of merit or righte|ou&s;ne&s;s with the Deity, as &s;hould be abundantly &s;uffi|cient to pay the price of man's redemption from the

And in order to accompli&s;h the&s;e ends, the &s;on of God engages in this grand moral conte&s;t concerning the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God as moral governor, and he decided the controver&s;y when he died on the cro&s;s and ro&s;e again from the dead triumphing over all the pow|ers of darkne&s;s. He then by his perfect and &s;inle&s;s obedience and death, fully <HI>declared the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God as moral governor.</HI> And it was by the intrin&s;ic value of the dignity of his per&s;on, his amazing humi|liation, his arduous &s;ervices and great &s;ufferings in obedience to the law of mediation, in order to declare God's righteou&s;ne&s;s, that he procured an infinite foun|tain of merit with the Father, &s;ufficient to pay our debt, that we had contracted by &s;in, in reproaching the divine character, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing his laws, and rebel|ling again&s;t his righteous government; and thus, by a merit of condignity, he hath paid the price of our redemption, and purcha&s;ed liberty, life and glory for all that believe in him. And God the father hath be|&s;towed on him, as a reward of condignity, the honour and glory of governing the whole univer&s;e. The re|ward is equal in value to the &s;ervices and &s;ufferings. As a reward of his humiliation, &s;ervices and &s;uffer|ings, he hath all judgment committed into his hands &mdash;and receives homage and wor&s;hip from angels and men&mdash;and hath pardoned, and ju&s;tified and &s;aved, a numerous offspring given him by the Father&mdash;and he is appointed to be the judge of all, to pa&s;s the la&s;t &s;en|tence on his friends and on his enemies. He will have the honour at the la&s;t day to &s;ay to his friends, and all that believe in him&mdash;"Come ye ble&s;&s;ed of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">y Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you"&mdash;
<PB N="27" REF="020706_0027_0FB0A4FF0DF6E3E0">
And he will reward them with granting them an open and an abundant enterance into his heavenly kingdom, where they &s;hall live and reign with Chri&s;t, with crowns of victory on their heads, and palms of victory in their hands, for ever and ever.&mdash;He will al&s;o have the honour to &s;ay to his enemies, and all that re|jected his go&s;pel by enmity and unbelief&mdash;"Go ye cur&s;ed into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels." And he will &s;ay to all infidels in that day, "Tho&s;e my enemies that would not that I &s;hould reign over them, bring them hither and &s;lay them be|fore me."&mdash;"And they &s;hall be tormented with fire and brim&s;tone in the pre&s;ence of the holy angels, and in the pre&s;ence of the Lamb. And the &s;moke of their torments a&s;cendeth up for ever and ever." And this will be the day of the manife&s;tation of the righteous judgement of God. God declared to angels and man, If they tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed his command, they &s;hould &s;urely die: And the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in this &s;entence, is witne&s;&s;ed by the law and the prophets. But &s;inners will not believe God's word. They imagine that God will violate his ju&s;tice and truth, to &s;ave tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors; &mdash;and &s;inners have been ever &s;ince the fall, di&s;puting the ju&s;tice and righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, in the eternal damnation of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. The eternal &s;on of God, appeared by the appointment of the Father, to decide this controver&s;y, and put an end to this quarrel, and make the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God as moral governor, i. e. the infinite benevolence, the inflexible ju&s;tice, and in|violable truth of God appear. To this end he con&s;ent|ed to become a victim in the devil's kingdom, and to be &s;acrificed in that great city, which is &s;piritually called Sodom and Egypt, by the hand of his enemies. And this was according to the determinate coun&s;el and fore knowledge of God; as being a part of the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t plan that could be devi&s;ed. And in all this &s;inners, with wicked hands, did nothing to him, but what God's hand and coun&s;el determined before to be
<PB N="28" REF="020706_0028_0FB0A502EA07C7E8">
done. And this moral conte&s;t between the &s;on of God and the devil, concerning the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God's character as moral governor; e&s;pecially concerning the inflexiblene&s;s of his ju&s;tice, and the inviolablene&s;s of his truth, expre&s;&s;ed in the threatening; and how it was decided by Chri&s;t on the cro&s;s, was foretold by all the prophets.</P>
<P>TO this, that mo&s;t ancient prediction had refer|ence, Gen. iii. 15. "And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy &s;eed and her &s;eed: It &s;hall brui&s;e thy head, and thou &s;halt brui&s;e his heel." And P&s;al. xlv. 3. &amp;c. "Gird thy &s;word upon thy thigh, O mo&s;t mighty! with thy glory and thy maje&s;ty. And in thy maje&s;ty ride pro&s;perou&s;ly, becau&s;e of truth, meekne&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s; and thy right hand &s;hall teach the terrible things," &amp;c. And I&s;a. ix. 5.6. &amp;c. "For every battle of the warrior is with confu&s;ed noi&s;e, and garments rolled in blood; but <HI>this</HI> &s;hall be with burning and fuel of fire," &amp;c. See al&s;o I&s;a lxiii. from the fir&s;t to the &s;ixth ver&s;e.&mdash; And all the victims and &s;acrifices under the law, were types of the victim and &s;acrifice that Chri&s;t was made in the devil's kingdom, not by God the father, but by his enemies; by means of which he decided this moral controver&s;y. And although this was decreed, fore-known and predicted by God; yet &s;inners execu|ted the&s;e decrees, and fulfilled the&s;e predictions, in the exerci&s;e of their own free agency, without any influ|ence from the decrees, fore-knowledge, or predictions of God, as inclining them to form or execute the&s;e wicked de&s;igns of theirs.</P>
<P>GOD did not by his decrees or efficiency put Chri&s;t to death, or either form or execute, by his creating power, the wicked de&s;igns of his crucifiers; if he had, his &s;ufferings and death would not have declared God's righteou&s;ne&s;s. For what manife&s;tation of righteou&s;|ne&s;s
<PB N="29" REF="020706_0029_0FB0A503E3C33278">
is it for a righteous Governor to inflict that pu|ni&s;hment on the innocent, that is threatened only to the guilty. But God in his wi&s;e and holy providence over-ruled what they meant for evil, and naturally tended to evil, for great good. But becau&s;e God was more than a match for them, and prevented their de|&s;ign to dethrone him as moral governor, and ruin his kingdom from producing its natural effects and con&s;e|quences; this doth by no means exculpate the &s;inner, or remove the blame, or imply that God is in any &s;en&s;e the Author of Sin. This proves their de&s;ign to de|throne God, and ruin his moral kingdom, in putting Chri&s;t to death, to be an infinite evil, in its nature and tendency, and their own production; and that they de&s;erve an infinite or endle&s;s puni&s;hment for it. This proves that they were enemies to God, and op|po&s;ed to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of his government; and they would prevent his ju&s;tice taking place, and the truth of his threatening being verified, if it was in their power. And they would make all intelligent creatures believe, that for God to execute the threat|ening on tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, according to truth and ju&s;tice, is incon&s;i&s;tent with the exerci&s;e of infinite goodne&s;s, love and benevolence and righteou&s;ne&s;s to his creatures.</P>
<P>AND this &s;in is not a created exi&s;tence as the &s;oul it&s;elf is, made by God; nor is it an e&s;&s;ential mode as activity or exerci&s;e is to a living &s;oul; but a contin|gent mode of exerci&s;e, produced or formed by the &s;in|ner in tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the divine law. As crookedne&s;s is not an e&s;&s;ential mode of a line as extention is, but only a contingent mode.</P>
<P>THE controver&s;y between God and devils, Chri&s;t and infidels, is this&mdash;Is God a righteous Governor? Is his law holy, ju&s;t and good? Will God execute the threatening in damning &s;inners to all eternity?&mdash;And to decide this, Chri&s;t Je&s;us &s;ubmitted to be made a
<PB N="30" REF="020706_0030_0FB0A50568451118">
victim and &s;acrifice by devils and wicked men, to give them opportunity to act out their enmity to the ju&s;tice and righteou&s;ne&s;s of God as moral Governor, that they might be convinced of the evil nature and tendency of this enmity, and their own ju&s;t de&s;ert of eternal damna|tion for it, according to the threatening of the law.</P>
<P>AND this &s;acrifice of the &s;on of God was infinite! For the Lord of life and glory, a per&s;on of infinite dignity, freely to humble him&s;elf to take human nature, and cloath it with the moral perfections of his divine, &s;o as to make it one with him&s;elf, on purpo&s;e that he might put his divine character, as heir of the king|dom, into the power of his enemies, who denied the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the divine government&mdash;and had an inveterate enmity to it&mdash;how wonderful! Of this won|derful humiliation of the Son of God, the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks,&mdash;Phil. ii. 6.7.8.&mdash;"Who being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with God; but made him&s;elf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a &s;ervant, and was made in likene&s;s of men. And being found in fa&s;hion as a man," &amp;c.</P>
<P>AND for a per&s;on of &s;uch infinite dignity to &s;uffer him&s;elf to be conquered by his enemies, and be as a helple&s;s victim in the power of his creatures, and give them opportunity to deny his divinity&mdash;and challenge his veracity&mdash;when he appeared unable to vindicate him&s;elf. And for God the Son to make &s;uch repre|&s;entations to his holy benevolent &s;oul, of the evil of &s;in&mdash;the di&s;plea&s;ure of God again&s;t it&mdash;the dreadful &s;ufferings of the damned&mdash;and the awful &s;cene of &s;uf|ferings through which he had to pa&s;s in order to make atonement, and for&s;ake it and leave it in the power of the enemy&mdash;and to deliver up his body to poverty, pain and death, when cloathed with the moral cha|racter of his divine, mu&s;t be an infinite &s;acrifice!&mdash; But this was the only way in which the grand contro|ver&s;y,
<PB N="31" REF="020706_0031_0FB0A506E1ED5938">
concerning God's righteou&s;ne&s;s as moral Go|vernor, that commenced upon the apo&s;tacy of angels, could be decided; for would a le&s;s expen&s;ive one an|&s;wer, this would not have been wi&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT in this way God's righteou&s;ne&s;s was declared in every part of it, viz. Benevolence, Ju&s;tice and Truth. By the Son of God, thus being &s;et forth to be a propitiation, and made a cur&s;e by being crucified and &s;lain, not by his Father, but by his enemies; the infinite benevolence of God to his moral kingdom, is manife&s;ted and declared in a manner in which it could be declared by no other means. For God not to &s;pare his own Son, but deliver him up to &s;uch &s;ufferings for the &s;ake of redeeming &s;inners, how great the love!&mdash; And for the Son of God to offer his liberty, life and glory, a &s;acrifice to pay the price of our ran&s;om, what an infinite expre&s;&s;ion of benevolence!</P>
<P>AND the ju&s;tice of God in the threatened penalty, and his di&s;po&s;ition and determination to execute it on the &s;inner, that is not intere&s;ted in the atonement by faith, is fully declared in this tran&s;action.</P>
<P>THE Son of God in this way gave opportunity to &s;inners to act out their enmity to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God as moral Governor, in a manner in which it could by no other means be expre&s;&s;ed. For he puts the whole moral character of God, as moral Governor, in their power, and gives them opportunity to dethrone him, and put him to death, as the heir of the Crown. And if this is the tendency and nature of &s;in&mdash;it is an in|finite evil&mdash;and de&s;erves eternal death&mdash;the threaten|ing is ju&s;t&mdash;and the lea&s;t degree of puni&s;hment cannot be remitted, con&s;i&s;tent with the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God as moral Governor, unle&s;s adequate &s;atisfaction be made; but the &s;inner being a creature, can neither do nor &s;uffer any thing by virtue of which he can be re|lea&s;ed
<PB N="32" REF="020706_0032_0FB0A50861D04000">
from the threatened penalty. And hence God in&s;i&s;ts upon the mediator and &s;urety, being a per&s;on of infinite dignity and merit; and that he do and &s;uf|fer that which is of infinite value;&mdash;that, which &s;hall bring infinite honour to his character as moral Gover|nor, and infinite good to his kingdom. And this our mediator and &s;urety did, when he declared God's righteou&s;ne&s;s, by being made a propitiation. He then condemned &s;in as an infinite evil, broke the &s;erpent's head, expo&s;ed all his wicked de&s;igns again&s;t God's character and kingdom, and de&s;troyed the devil's pow|er and dominion, that is &s;upported by error and wic|kedne&s;s; and e&s;tabli&s;hed the kingdom of God by the manife&s;tation of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s.&mdash;As Samp|&s;on, by being conquered by his enemies conquered them; and by being &s;lain by them &s;lew them; &s;o Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Captain of our &s;alvation, by being made a cur&s;e, i. e. a victim by his enemies, and be|ing &s;acrificed by them, hath conquered and de&s;troyed them all in a moral &s;en&s;e. The cur&s;e which the Son of God was made, was not the cur&s;e threatened to the &s;inner in the law, but the &s;ub&s;titute of it, and fully an&s;wered the penalty; for the cur&s;e threatened to the &s;inner included in it &s;piritual and eternal death, and implies that the &s;inner is the victim or object of the wrath and anger of God: But the Son of God, in be|ing made a cur&s;e for us, never was the object or victim of the divine anger or wrath, nor did he &s;uffer &s;piri|tual or eternal death. When it plea&s;ed the Father to brui&s;e him, and put him to grief, and make his holy &s;oul an offering for &s;in, God the Father was not him|&s;elf the executioner, but he delivers him up out of his bo&s;om, into the power of the enemy, and &s;aith, "A|wake, O &s;word, again&s;t my Shepherd, again&s;t the man that is my fellow." And God laid on him the iniqui|ties of us all, i. e. imputed to him the immen&s;e debt we had contracted by our iniquities&mdash;and were unable to di&s;charge&mdash;but Chri&s;t paid it, by his &s;ervices and
<PB N="33" REF="020706_0033_0FB0A50A94DDCFE8">
&s;ufferings, in declaring God's righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;o executing judgement on God's enemies.</P>
<P>THE &s;word which God waked up again&s;t Chri&s;t, mu&s;t not be con&s;idered as a pa&s;&s;ive weapon in the hand of God; but free di&s;tinct agents, capable to form their own wicked de&s;igns, and execute them on Chri&s;t; and their enmity to him was waked up by the manife&s;ta|tion of the truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s of God's character to their con&s;ciences. But God's conduct in deliver|ing him up, and leaving him in the power of the ene|my, to be treated by them as he was, gave occa&s;ion to many to e&s;teem him &s;tricken and &s;mitten of God, and afflicted: But he was then paying our debt in this manner, and was the object of his Father's love, and not the victim of his wrath. And God the Father's in&s;i&s;ting on &s;uch an adequate &s;atisfaction being made, before he would pardon one &s;in, or relea&s;e the &s;inner from the threatened penalty, declares God's <HI>di&s;po&s;ition</HI> and determination to puni&s;h the devils, and every chri&s;tle&s;s &s;inner, to all eternity, as fully as if we had &s;een eternal damnation already executed on them.</P>
<P>AND how dreadful mu&s;t be the ca&s;e and condition of all &s;uch as neglect to attend to this go&s;pel plan of &s;al+vation, &s;o as to obtain the knowledge of it, and be+lieve it, and cordially embrace it, and return to the knowledge, love and &s;ervice and enjoyment of God, in this way, which he hath in infinite wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s provided? This way is not provided to &s;ave &s;in|ners in their &s;ins, but to &s;ave them from their &s;ins. Without holine&s;s of heart and life, no man can &s;ee the Lord. Faith in Chri&s;t is not de&s;igned to make void the moral law, and give us a low e&s;teem of God's ju&s;|tice; but to e&s;tabli&s;h it, and to &s;upport the moral go|vernment of God. Chri&s;t Je&s;us is not the mini&s;ter of &s;in. All that preach up &s;alvation for &s;inners, without their exerci&s;ing faith in Chri&s;t's merits and holine&s;s,
<PB N="34" REF="020706_0034_0FB0A50B69E572D8">
and a conformity to the moral law as a rule of life, encourage rebellion in God's kingdom, and may ex|pect to receive an aggravated damnation. This is the only &s;tate of probation for &s;inners&mdash;all that die without faith in Chri&s;t, and holine&s;s of heart, will re|main under the guilt and power of &s;in, and the tyran|ny of &s;atan, and the wrath of God and the Lamb, to all eternity!&mdash;Do not dream of any other &s;tate of pro|bation after this life is ended, for God hath expre&s;sly declared the contrary in his word; and it is incon&s;i&s;t|ent with rea&s;on, and the de&s;ign of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of probation, that any other &s;hould be revealed to us in this &s;tate; for this would fru&s;trate the de&s;ign of it. O then, our improvement of the pre&s;ent, will move an eternity for or again&s;t us!&mdash;But you will &s;ay, Then what will become of the heathen? How can they be|lieve in Chri&s;t, who have not the go&s;pel?&mdash;To this I an&s;wer, That tho&s;e who never had the means of knowledge in their power, and &s;o never could know that God had found a ran&s;om, or provided an atone|ment, will never be condemned for not believing the go&s;pel; but they will be condemned for their en|mity to God and his righteou&s;ne&s;s, as manife&s;ted to them by the light of nature or the moral law; for the&s;e afford light enough to convince and condemn &s;inners, though not enough to &s;ave them. But the &s;a|cred &s;criptures declare, that the go&s;pel hath been preached to all; and that all may have &s;ufficient means of knowledge of the atonement to &s;ave them, if they do not neglect to hear and under&s;tand the &s;aving truth. See Rom. x. 17.18. Col. i. 23. Wherever &s;acrifi|ces were known, the go&s;pel hath been preached&mdash;and it hath been communicated from one nation to another by tradition&mdash;and in&s;pired men have been rai&s;ed up formerly, and &s;ent into all nations, to &s;pread the go&s;|pel;&mdash;and if any have not received &s;ufficient know|ledge of the atonement for &s;alvation, it will not be be|cau&s;e they could not obtain &s;ufficient means of know|ledge,
<PB N="35" REF="020706_0035_0FB0A51130659278">
but becau&s;e they hated the light, and would not attend to it. Much le&s;s knowledge of the go&s;pel was &s;ufficient for &s;alvation, before Chri&s;t came, and among the heathen, than is now required of us, who have the written word in our hands, and have mini&s;ters to ex|plain it to us, and u&s;e in&s;tructions and motives with us. If we &s;hould not repent and believe the go&s;pel, but remain infidels, it will not be for want of means of knowledge, but our neglect to attend and hear and under&s;tand the truth. We &s;hall have no excu&s;e, if we neglect to hear, &s;o as to obtain the &s;aving knowledge of the truth, and the influences of the holy &s;pirit. God is inflexible in his ju&s;tice, and would not pardon or pa&s;s by one in&s;tance of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion or di&s;obedience, 'till adequate &s;atisfaction was made, &s;ufficient to vin|dicate the honour of his ju&s;tice, expre&s;&s;ed in the threatening. And he verifies the truth of this threat|ening in that he doth not pardon one &s;inner, 'till he is united to the Mediator by faith in him, and &s;o is intere&s;ted in that infinite fountain of merit which he hath procured, and is lodged with the Father.</P>
<P>IT would be as incon&s;i&s;tent with the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, as moral Governor, and all the rights of his go|vernment, to pardon and &s;ave an infidel or unbeliever, remaining &s;uch, as it would have been to &s;ave &s;inners, had Chri&s;t never come, or any atonement been made. And God can as con&s;i&s;tently pardon and &s;ave devils as infidels, or any that finally reject the atonement or deny the nece&s;&s;ity of it. We mu&s;t fir&s;t own our&s;elves rebels ju&s;tly condemned, and no way to make &s;atisfac|tion by any thing we can do or &s;uffer&mdash;and receive the atonement Chri&s;t hath made&mdash;and own there is no o|ther name by which we can be &s;aved&mdash;or Chri&s;t will profit us nothing.</P>

Chri&s;t Je&s;us did not die to make God the Fa|ther benevolent&mdash;the death of Chri&s;t was the effect, and not the cau&s;e, of God's love and grace, manife&s;t|ed to &s;inners. "God &s;o loved the world, that he gave his only begotten &s;on," &amp;c. What Chri&s;t did and &s;uf|fered, was only to open a way for God freely to exer|ci&s;e his love and grace to &s;inners, in pardoning, ju&s;ti|fying, and &s;aving them, con&s;i&s;tent with his ju&s;tice and truth, expre&s;&s;ed in the threatening. And it is a grand mi&s;repre&s;entation of this affair, which the Univer&s;ali&s;ts make, when they tell us, that becau&s;e the merit of the Son of God was a proper merit of condignity, equiva|lent in value to all the honours conferred on him, and benefits be&s;towed on his friends, that therefore God is obliged to &s;ave all mankind on account of the merit of the Redeemer: For the Son of God hath, by a merit of condignity, purcha&s;ed of the Father the honour to

damn his enemies, as much as to &s;ave his friends; and therefore univer&s;al damnation may be as clearly infer|red from the merit of condignity, as univer&s;al &s;alva|tion. The merit of Chri&s;t being a merit of condigni|ty and &s;ufficient for the &s;alvation of all, doth not lay God under obligation to pardon any. And if he doth pardon and &s;ave any, it is free and &s;overeign grace in the Father, to which the &s;inner can lay no claim, any more for what Chri&s;t hath done and &s;uffer|ed.&mdash;Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in declaring God's righteou&s;ne&s;s, obtains of God all the honours he receives him&s;elf, and all the benefits men have through him, by a proper <HI>merit</HI> of <HI>condignity,</HI> and a true purcha&s;e by an equiva|lent.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Pre&s;ident Edwards&mdash;Origl. Sin. p. 183.</NOTE> And hath hereby opened a way for God to appear faithful and ju&s;t, in forgiving the &s;ins of peni|tent believers. And hereby Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath purcha|&s;ed the gift of the Holy Spirit to be the great agent in his kingdom, to accompany tho&s;e truths exhibited by his cro&s;s, by his power and efficacious influences to rectify the moral principle, that was totally corrupted by the fall, and to convince of &s;in, produce repent|ance, faith and love in the &s;oul, and bring the &s;inner into a &s;tate of union with Chri&s;t Je&s;us, in order to ren|der it con&s;i&s;tent with the ju&s;tice of God to pardon ju&s;tify and &s;ave him. And the Holy Spirit accompanying the truths of the go&s;pel, which is the only mini&s;tration of the Spirit, in its &s;aving influences, brings the &s;oul to the practice of holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;o car|ries on a work of &s;anctification, 'till it becomes me<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> for the &s;ight and enjoyment of God in heaven.</P>
<P>NOW it is evident, that the principal de&s;ign of di|vine revelation is to communicate the&s;e truths to man|kind, and &s;o mini&s;ter the Holy Spirit to men. And now, whatever alterations or corruptions the divine oracles may have &s;uffered as to any circum&s;tantial parts
<PB N="38" REF="020706_0038_0FB0A515463D1F48">
of the hi&s;tory, yet this principal part of divine revela|tion, it is evident, never hath been corrupted, but is now contained in the &s;acred &s;criptures pure and entire; and the Spirit doth accompany the&s;e truths: For as it is &s;elf-evident to every one who under&s;tands it, that this plan could not have been devi&s;ed at fir&s;t by any created wi&s;dom, and never could be known but by im|mediate revelation from God; &s;o if it had been cor|rupted, it never could have been rectified by any crea|ture, &s;o as to appear as it now doth, with all the di&s;tin|gui&s;hing marks of divine wi&s;dom, power and benevo|lence, and accompanied by the &s;pirit of truth. How is it po&s;&s;ible for creatures to know that God is willing to pardon rebels, unle&s;s he reveals it? Or how he can pardon &s;uch as have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed his laws, con&s;i&s;tent with his truth, and the righteou&s;ne&s;s of his govern|ment? Rea&s;on could not di&s;cover this! And this doc|trine of atonement by the Son of God, if rightly un|der&s;tood, carries in it as plain marks of infinite wi&s;|dom, power and benevolence, as are manife&s;ted in cre|ation: And we can in the &s;ame manner prove the di|vine original of the go&s;pel, as we can that this world is of divine original. We need not go to any external evidences to prove that the go&s;pel is from God, if we have but a right &s;peculative under&s;tanding of the doc|trines therein contained. No created benevolence could conceive &s;uch mercy and grace to enemies&mdash;no created wi&s;dom could devi&s;e &s;uch a method for the ex|erci&s;e of it&mdash;and no created power could accompli&s;h &s;uch a plan in &s;uch an a&s;toni&s;hing way! The devil ne|ver invented it; for it is &s;ubver&s;ive of his kingdom and intere&s;t: It is incon&s;i&s;tent with the character of any good creature to put &s;uch a cheat upon mankind (if he was able) as to attribute that to God, of which he him&s;elf was the author. But no created being was able to lay out &s;uch a plan&mdash;thus to di&s;play the perfec|tions of God by occa&s;ion of &s;in, and even to render them more illu&s;trious than if &s;in had never entered in|to

his moral kingdom: And thus bring the greate&s;t good out of the greate&s;t evil!</P>
<P>HOW much doth this plan of redemption by Chri&s;t exceed all created wi&s;dom! What a glorious di&s;play of the divine! You might as well &s;et a created under|&s;tanding to lay out the plan of a world, as to devi&s;e &s;uch a plan as this! Let any rational infidel attend to it, and under&s;tand it, and he mu&s;t confe&s;s that the go&s;|pel in which it is contained, is of divine original. And that all the writings of heathen, and all the oracles of rea&s;on, are but hu&s;ks for the &s;wine to feed upon in com|pari&s;on of it. Who among them ever wrote concern|ing this grand moral conte&s;t, and how it commenced &mdash;and how it was decided&mdash;and the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God as moral Governor was declared, and atonement made, and the &s;pirit of truth in its &s;upernatural influ|ences, mini&s;tred, and a foundation laid to convert &s;in|ners from &s;in to righteou&s;ne&s;s, and deliver them from the power of darkne&s;s, and tran&s;late them into the kingdom of God's dear Son&mdash;and de&s;troy and torment wicked men and devils by the manife&s;tation of divine truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s? The&s;e truths will be the en|tertainment of heaven to all eternity. And, O! what an aggravated damnation will be their portion who finally reject this go&s;pel for the Oracles of Rea&s;on, and will not come to the light of this &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s, but do all they can to extingui&s;h it, and &s;o damn as many of mankind as they can. Should men and de|vils &s;trive to extingui&s;h the influences of the natural &s;un, and deprive mankind of the benefit of them; what a cruel and wicked de&s;ign would this di&s;cover: But this would be nothing in compari&s;on of the at|tempt of the Dei&s;ts, who are &s;eeking to extingui&s;h the light, and deprive mankind of the ble&s;&s;ed influences of the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, who hath ari&s;en on this dark and di&s;ea&s;ed world, with healing in his wings! On this Sun all depend for light, righteou&s;ne&s;s and

life; for grace and glory. O, then, attend to the light of this Sun! &s;tudy the &s;criptures&mdash;come to your Father's hou&s;e, and you will find bread enough and to &s;pare: But feed on hu&s;ks and you will to all eternity pe|ri&s;h with hunger. Could I but draw your earne&s;t atten|tion to the truths of the go&s;pel, &s;o that you would read, hear and meditate upon them, and improve Sabbaths and other opportunities, &s;eriou&s;ly to attend to them, and &s;eek to under&s;tand them; I &s;hould have hope con|cerning the wor&s;t of you, though you had been as bad as publicans and harlots&mdash;that you will obtain the knowledge of the truth, receive the &s;pirit of truth, that accompanies it, be convinced, repent of &s;in, be|lieve in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, receive his righteou&s;ne&s;s, be|come holy, and obtain &s;alvation with eternal glory. But &s;o long as you remain &s;ecure, and do not wake up and earne&s;tly attend to the truths of the go&s;pel&mdash;and do not improve Sabbaths and other opportunities to read the go&s;pel, or hear it preached; I &s;ee no rea&s;on to en|tertain hope, that your eyes will be opened 'till they are opened in the flames of hell&mdash;where your know|ledge and conviction of the truth will tend to torment you for ever and ever. But hear now, and receive the truth with faith and love, and your &s;ouls &s;hall live!</P>
