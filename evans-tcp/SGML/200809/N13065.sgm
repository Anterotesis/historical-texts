<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following collection of &s;ongs, idle and trifling as they may &s;eem at fir&s;t view, will, it is hoped, have a further u&s;e than mere amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>The &s;ongs are principally Naval and Military, join'd to a few others that have a tendency to ex|cite that love of our King, of our country, and of Liberty, which, in the brea&s;ts of Engli&s;hmen, are one and the &s;ame thing; and which, of all the pa&s;&s;ions, affords the noble&s;t &s;tock, upon which to graft the Military Virtues. It were to be wi&s;hed that there was greater choice; how|ever, the man who&s;e bo&s;om is open to the glow of patrioti&s;m and of glory, will hear few of them without &s;ome worthy feelings.&mdash;What is wanting in &s;entiment and poetry, may be often &s;upplied by the energy and ma&s;culine tones of the mu&s;ic; and when both combine, the &s;oul is rai&s;ed to a grateful pitch of gallant enthu&s;ia&s;m, the emo|tions of which make la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions, and give the &s;oldier a ta&s;te for tho&s;e hard&s;hips and dan|gers, which he would otherways undergo with reluctance, as mere points of duty.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h troops have for &s;ome years, had to do with an enemy that has never as yet beheld with &s;teady countenance, the glare of a rank of bayonets; and the navy, &s;kulking pirates alone to contend with, full of trick, but without bot|tom.&mdash;Men who, altho' of Engli&s;h de&s;cent, are
<PB N="ii" REF="016530_0003_0F9C8B232144E438">
thus deba&s;ed by engaging in pur&s;uits repugnant to all &s;en&s;e of honour, ju&s;tice and humanity. &mdash;There is now the pro&s;pect of a tougher ta&s;k for both. The e&s;tabli&s;hed armies and navies of the great European powers, (compo&s;ed of &s;oldiers and &s;eamen, train'd to firm &s;ervice, and full of officers po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a high point of honour and military ardour,) pre&s;ent a very different field for their ambition, and call for a full ex|ertion of all their ancient virtue.&mdash;A field, in which &s;uperior valour and di&s;cipline will not only command that re&s;pect which is ever their own, but in&s;ure complete &s;ucce&s;s; in which, the de|ci&s;ion will depend more upon the arms than the legs, and in which the mo&s;t &s;trenuous gra&s;p will always reap a full harve&s;t of glory. There the firm &s;oldier will not be balked of his object by the illu&s;ive &s;hifts of a &s;hrinking enemy, nor obliged to imitate practices de&s;pi&s;ed, and indeed heretofore unknown to the Briti&s;h troops, in or|der to gain, at be&s;t, a negative triumph; but will have fair occa&s;ions, amid&s;t the &s;erious but liberal contentions of civilized war, to di&s;|play all the virtues of his profe&s;&s;ion, and contra&s;t the awful qualities that &s;way the fate of battle, with that humanity which alone can gild his lau|rels with true &s;plendor, and &s;tamp a &s;acred &s;eal upon his merit.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who have any knowledge of the hu|man heart, a knowledge of all others the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to an officer, and who are aware of the powers of mu&s;ic and poetry over the mind of man, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay much in favour of this at|tempt.&mdash;With others of lighter minds, it may po&s;&s;ibly incur ridicule and excite to laughter, but until &s;uch gentlemen are plea&s;ed, by giving the
<PB N="iii" REF="016530_0004_0F9C8B23E1924CA0">
rea&s;ons of their merriment, to &s;how whether their cen&s;ure is more owing to the accutene&s;s of their wit or the depth of their judgment, it is in vain to contend with them. In the mean time they will have an opportunity of amu&s;ing them &s;elves occa&s;ionally, with a &s;ong that they might not &s;o readily procure a copy of, and &s;o far they will allow there is no harm done.</P>
<P>To readers of ta&s;te and &s;entiment, it is need|le&s;s to ob&s;erve, that many of tho&s;e odes breathe a pure &s;pirit of liberty, warlike ardor, and pa|trioti&s;m, adorned with much of the fire, ima|gination, and melody of genuine poetry: Some of a more tender nature, throw a mild and plea|&s;ing lu&s;tre upon the military profe&s;&s;ions and the duties attending them; while others of a coar&s;er ca&s;t, are peculiarly calculated to engage the people and &s;trengthen their attachment to their King, country, and its con&s;titution, by combining the intere&s;ts of their enjoyments and appetites, as well as their rights, with the duties of good citi|zens: Of tho&s;e, many may appear not to de&s;erve a place, but the popular ta&s;te has &s;tamped a va|lue upon them which ought not to be di&s;puted&mdash; Even the Briti&s;h Grenadiers, unworthy as the words are of the &s;ubject, will reach the heart of every Engli&s;h &s;oldier.</P>
<P>An officer of &s;ervice, if po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a poetical genius, might certainly, in compo&s;itions of this kind, inculcate the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential points of mili|tary duty and honour, by adapting the words and mu&s;ic to the various operations of war.</P>
<P>In a light infantry &s;ong, for in&s;tance, the 1&s;t ver&s;e to repre&s;ent that corps turning out upon an alarm, and forming in front of its wigwams&mdash; the mu&s;ic irregular, bouncing, elevated. The
<PB N="iv" REF="016530_0005_0F9C8B25623E8678">
2d ver&s;e, advancing upon the enemy into cover, the mu&s;ic &s;prightly, animated, but regular.&mdash;In &s;hort, a good quick-&s;tep tune. The 3d ver&s;e, firing, gaining ground, and operating to the flanks &mdash;the mu&s;ic broken, confus'd, elevated. The 4th ver&s;e, a bloody pur&s;uit&mdash;the mu&s;ic rapid, crowd|ed, har&s;h. The 5th ver&s;e, the action decided and re&s;i&s;tance at an end, the &s;oldiers yielding to the impul&s;e of pity and humanity, &s;paring and protecting the vanqui&s;h'd&mdash;the mu&s;ic in melting tones of tender &s;ympathy, unbending the high wound &s;pirits to the &s;ofter, but equally manly feelings of generous compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In a Song for the heavy foot, the line to be repre&s;ented as moving on to battle, &s;teady, firm, and &s;low.&mdash;The mu&s;ic &s;olemn, regular, <HI>d&eacute;cid&eacute;.</HI> Then engaged in clo&s;e action and charging.&mdash; The mu&s;ic lofty, &s;trenuous. La&s;tly, the enemy routed, the line leaving the pur&s;uit to the light troops, and employed in regaining its order, preparatory to a &s;econd attack.&mdash;The mu&s;ic more calm and regular, with &s;ome &s;wells of triumph.</P>
<P>The Highland March is &s;ingularly &s;uited to &s;uch a &s;ubject. The fir&s;t part&mdash;the line in march. The &s;econd part or chorus&mdash;engaged, and the few la&s;t notes re&s;uming its order.</P>
<P>A Song for the Cavalry might repre&s;ent that body as availing it&s;elf of its advantages.&mdash;If again&s;t hor&s;e, the &s;quadrons advancing with velocity to the charge, avoiding all u&s;e of fire arms, and tru&s;ting entirely to the momentum of their hor&s;es and the points of their &s;words, ral|lying in&s;tantly to their &s;tandards, after the di&s;order nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;ing from the &s;hock, and carrying every thing before them by the joint
<PB N="v" REF="016530_0006_0F9C8B262162E3E8">
effect of their cohe&s;ion and impetuo&s;ity.&mdash;If again&s;t infantry, the &s;quadrons taking &s;helter from the effect of their fire, by plunging among them, and, once in, remaining there to keep them down&mdash;If in pur&s;uit, the hor&s;e abandon|ing them&s;elves at all hazards without he&s;itation upon the enemy, to retard their flight.</P>
<P>Many other general points of duty, and of intere&s;t might be interwoven among the imagery in the&s;e Songs, as equally &s;uitable to all of them; &s;uch as &s;ilence&mdash;obedience&mdash;to &s;tand by the colours&mdash;to adhere to their officers and to their comrades&mdash;to keep up their fire, and rely chiefly on their bayonets or &s;words&mdash;the little lo&s;s that troops ever &s;uffer in action, compared to the &s;laughter in flight&mdash;the triumph and ad|vantages of victory, with the mi&s;ery attending captivity, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The above hints may be of u&s;e to tho&s;e gen|tlemen, who, although not bred to the profe&s;|&s;ion of arms, may be di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t this de&s;ign by their poetical exertions. To Soldiers it is not meant to pre&s;cribe rules&mdash;their ideas will naturally keep the proper bounds, and their ge|nius uncon&s;trained make bolder efforts.</P>
<P>The Corps of Artillery well de&s;erve to have a Song apart, but it mu&s;t come from them&s;elves.</P>
<P>With regard to the Navy, it would require the knowledge of a thorough bred Seaman, joined to great powers of imagination, and a warm predilection in favour of his country and pro|fe&s;&s;ion, to enable a man to compo&s;e any thing worthy of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent when the warlike &s;pirit of the na|tion is thoroughly rou&s;ed, this Book may be look|ed into by others as well as military men, and
<PB N="vi" REF="016530_0007_0F9C8B26DF4BBFD0">
therefore the occa&s;ion is proper for taking no|tice of an unworthy and narrow prejudice, which in England not only prevails among the lower people, where alone it is excu&s;able, but is al&s;o received by an order of men, who both from their rank in the community and general edu|cation, ought to entertain more liberal and ju&s;t opinions.</P>
<P>Many of the country gentlemen indulge in an ungenerous jealou&s;y and di&s;like of the Bri|ti&s;h Army that does little honour either to their knowledge of the con&s;titution or of the hi&s;tory of their country. Tho&s;e who truly under&s;tand the nature of the government of England, its &s;ituation and commercial intere&s;ts, perceive the unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity of &s;tanding forces, not only to &s;upport the power of the nation by pro|tecting its foreign e&s;tabli&s;hments, and to com|mand the forbearance and re&s;pect of its neigh|bours, by enabling it to act offencively again&s;t tho&s;e who may adventure to injure or in&s;ult it, but al&s;o to &s;ecure us from the &s;udden enterprizes of the immen&s;e armies kept ever on foot by the enemies of England and of liberty, within twelve hours &s;ail of our coa&s;t. Brave as the people of Britain are, time is nece&s;&s;ary to form and train them to arms, and it requires a guarded and cautious hand to introduce gradually the &s;ub|ordination nece&s;&s;ary to qualify the militia to act in any degree in concert for the general pur|po&s;es of &s;ervice, and to cheri&s;h at the &s;ame time that high and independant &s;pirit which renders Engli&s;hmen when undi&s;ciplined the wor&s;t, and when di&s;ciplined the very be&s;t &s;oldiers of the world.&mdash;For this purpo&s;e too the in&s;tructions of the officers of the army and the example of
<PB N="vii" REF="016530_0008_0F9C8B27A47AF188">
the troops are both e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary; and granting it practicable by this means to put the militia in a few months in a condition to cope with men who had pa&s;&s;ed their lives in arms and had been long inured to war, it would &s;till re|quire a proportion of thorough bred officers to a&s;&s;i&s;t in conducting and fighting it, as well as a train of regular artillery and a good cavalry, which, with many other nece&s;&s;ary aids, can on|ly be derived from a permanent military e&s;ta|bli&s;hment. In fact, the militia and the army are equally nece&s;&s;ary to the power and &s;ecurity of the Briti&s;h Empire, and mo&s;t ju&s;tly has the former been termed the &s;hield, the latter the &s;word of England: But he who a&s;&s;erts that a militia is alone &s;ufficient or equal to all the oc|ca&s;ions of war, mu&s;t either be uncapable of counting, or prompted by &s;ome bad de&s;ign.</P>
<P>A brave militia, conducted by officers who knew the extent of its powers, and exacted no more from it than was to be expected from its di&s;cipline and experience, might certainly in a country &s;o &s;ingularly &s;trong as England is from its inclo&s;ures, render every hedge a bloody en|trenchment to an invading enemy, with the co|operation of a certain proportion of veteran foot to &s;teel the edge of the points of attack, &s;o as to enable the nation to adopt an offen&s;ive mode of defence, (the only one worthy of the &s;pirit of Britons or of &s;ucce&s;s,) and take the lead in every &s;ervice which required that coolne&s;s and pre|ci&s;ion of manoeuvre in the face of an enemy, that alone can enable troops to attack and re-attack with confidence and effect, and which is &s;carce to be attained without long practice and the habit of danger.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="016530_0009_0F9C8B2861A20BE0">Perhaps there has only been two periods &s;ince the re&s;toration in which the militia of England could be deemed in any degree equal to the in|ternal defence of the country&mdash;in the war of 56, after two years of great exertion and dili|gence, and at pre&s;ent, when a twelvemonth has been heartily employed by the united con&s;ent of all men to prepare it&mdash;at both times they have been formed under the in&s;truction, and &s;timulated by the example of very gallant and highly di&s;ciplined &s;tanding armies.</P>
<P>It has been a cu&s;tom to cite the brilliant mi|litary &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the Edwards and the Henries as proofs of the inutility of &s;tanding forces; but before this plea is urged, it may not be im|proper to recollect that France and Spain were in tho&s;e ages &s;everally divided within them&s;elves, as well as unconnected with each other; and their kings, with very little authority, &s;carce any revenue, and no army at all; whereas at pre&s;ent the&s;e monarchs have entire command of the properties and per&s;ons of their &s;ubjects, an immen&s;e revenue, 500,000 regular troops at their nod, and are clo&s;ely united, with the &s;ame objects in view.</P>
<P>With regard to the Navy, no doubt without its &s;upport we could neither be powerful abroad, nor &s;afe at home, and were fighting at &s;ea alone in que&s;tion, it is equal to every thing; but it cannot &s;ail again&s;t the wind, it cannot be every where at the &s;ame time, nor can it follow an in|vading enemy on &s;hore.</P>
<P>Without the advantage of a &s;uperior marine, as well as of a willing con&s;titutional militia, an army of 200,000 men, with a number of &s;trong fortre&s;&s;es, would &s;carce be &s;ufficient to &s;ecure
<PB N="ix" REF="016530_0010_0F9C8B29232DDC00">
Great-Britain again&s;t the Hou&s;e of Bourbon. As it is, 30 or 40,000 made &s;oldiers, under officers who know how to employ them with oeconomy, and draw from the militia the aids it may be ca|pable of, will, whil&s;t our navy is in condition to di&s;pute the dominion of the &s;ea, prove a full match for any force that an enemy may in an un|guarded moment, or in con&s;equence of a favour|ing wind, or of a &s;ucce&s;sful &s;ea action find means to land. But the man who from his enthu&s;ia&s;m for liberty, &s;hould de&s;ire to &s;ee this very &s;mall comparative proportion of &s;tanding forces further reduced, mu&s;t have di&s;covered with the rebel Con|gre&s;s, that the French king is the be&s;t protector of our rights and con&s;titution, and therefore wi&s;h to give him an opportunity of reforming the errors of our government, by introducing among&s;t us 60 or 80,000 of tho&s;e legi&s;lators, u&s;ually employed by his predece&s;&s;ors to e&s;tabli&s;h peace, liberty and happine&s;s among their neighbours.</P>
<P>Gentlemen of this ca&s;t mu&s;t indeed be little read in hi&s;tory not to have in mind, that to the virtue of a &s;tanding army we owe a re&s;toration and a revolution without blood&s;hed, wa&s;te or confu&s;i|on; and the reduction of two rebellions, &s;ub|ver&s;ive of all liberty and property, at times when the nation &s;eemed re&s;igned to its fate, or over|whelmed with de&s;pondency&mdash;and al&s;o that to the virtue of the army it has been often owing that the promoters of &s;edition have been prevented from endangering real liberty by de&s;troying all order and government.</P>
<P>All circum&s;tances weighed, it cannot but ap|pear to tho&s;e who are &s;uperior to prejudice, and capable of taking a comprehen&s;ive and liberal view, that, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the world, a
<PB N="x" REF="016530_0011_0F9C8B29E56712C0">
&s;tanding army is e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ecurity of the Briti&s;h empire again&s;t foreign attacks&mdash;con&s;e|quently to the exi&s;tence of the rights and proper|ty of the inhabitants; and that it is of equal im|portance to the great objects of liberty, that this army &s;hould not be mercenary, but have an in|tere&s;t in the con&s;titution of its country. Certain re&s;traints are no doubt nece&s;&s;ary to command the obedience and &s;ubordination of the military to the civil power, and to cru&s;h in the bud all attempts that might be made by unprincipled men to turn again&s;t the people tho&s;e arms which it is only ho|nourable to bear in their defence.</P>
<P>But tho&s;e who endeavour to undervalue the military character, or to make unnece&s;&s;ary en|croachments upon its profe&s;&s;ional rights, or by inferior u&s;age and invidious di&s;tinctions try to e&s;trange the troops from all attachment to their country and intere&s;t in the con&s;titution, can on|ly &s;tand acquitted of trea&s;on again&s;t the freedom of their fellow-&s;ubjects, at the expence of their intellects.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the army is held in that e&s;timation which its actions heretofore well claim, and which is the be&s;t &s;ecurity for its behaviour in future, it will continue to be full of officers, who from their education, property and rank in the kingdom, mu&s;t have an intere&s;t in the well-being of the na|tion, &s;uperior to all views of military command or emolument; &s;econded by &s;oldiers, who&s;e na|tural attachment to their country will be con|firmed by the &s;hare they are allowed in its credit and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>But &s;hould the profe&s;&s;ion of arms ever be held in di&s;re&s;pect, and tho&s;e that follow it unnece&s;&s;arily deprived of the common rights of citizens, or ex|po&s;ed
<PB N="xi" REF="016530_0012_0F9C8B2AF26B0350">
to in&s;ult and oppre&s;&s;ion, then indeed the army may become mercenary, as no man of ho|nour or property will remain in it, and tho&s;e who do, will naturally favour every change, having nothing to lo&s;e and every thing to gain.</P>
<P>As the writer of the&s;e lines may po&s;&s;ibly be gue&s;&s;ed at, and tho&s;e who are di&s;po&s;ed to judge with &s;everity, may among many other faults, cen|&s;ure the expre&s;&s;ions as too &s;trong or hazarded, and the language as not &s;ufficiently cha&s;te or indeed correct, he begs leave to be allowed in extenuation of his offences to ob&s;erve, that licences which might be extremely improper in a Sermon, may perhaps admit of excu&s;e in a preamble to a Book of Songs. In other re&s;pects, if he &s;hould &s;ucceed in drawing the attention of officers to an object that appears to him u&s;eful, he is little &s;olicitous about the appearance he him&s;elf may make upon this occa&s;ion, and with much indif|ference gives up his literary character to the wrath of whatever enraged critic may choo&s;e to exerci&s;e his gall upon it; recommending it to the gentlemen of that family, when they &s;hall find their bile overheated by &s;o doing, to quit the Preface and apply to the Songs, which will probably excite &s;ome unu&s;ual feelings of candor and good humour, that, however ill they may &s;uit the temper of a Critic's mind, will certainly contribute to the health of his body.</P>
