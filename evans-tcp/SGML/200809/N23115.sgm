<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE remarkable change which has lately took place in the circum&s;tances of a noted defender of Briti&s;h enormities, occa&s;ioned the writing of the following letter, and the reader will plea&s;e ob&s;erve, that it was wrote &s;olely for the information of a friend, and without the lea&s;t expectation that it would ever find its way into a printing-office.</P>
<P>The per&s;on whom we are led to &s;uppo&s;e the writer means, has been four years in this country. He came to it in a clande&s;tine manner, without a far|thing, and has lived here, <HI>&s;eemingly</HI> in the mid&s;t of plenty, without any <HI>known</HI> means of procuring &s;ub&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Lately, he has commenced bu&s;ine&s;s in a line which would require a con&s;iderable capital:&mdash;Whether Briti&s;h guineas or Tory dollars have, or have not, been the reward of his &s;currility&mdash;his abu&s;e of the immortal heroes of the American revolution, and of the friends of liberty in Europe&mdash;and his unwearied attempts to involve the United States in war with their republican allies, is worthy of examination by the friends of the happine&s;s and
pro&s;perity of America. Be that as it may, he de&s;erves the reprobation of all good men, by his profound devo|tion
<PB REF="030553_0005_0FE7C96A15664198">to that mon&s;ter who&s;e &s;attelites have, in the mo&s;t barbarous mon&s;ter, ravaged the United States, end whom, every man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the common feel|ings of humanity mu&s;t <HI>dete&s;t</HI> and <HI>abhor</HI>!</P>
<P>Much has been lately wrote in this city re&s;pec|ting the <HI>occupation</HI> of the per&s;on alluded to, in Europe and America; and &s;ome have even hinted, that the thefts, hous&s;e and &s;hop-breakings, &amp;c. which have been &s;o numerous lately in and about Philadelphia, has enabled him to emerge!</P>
<P>The editors, on &s;eeing the letter, earne&s;tly &s;oli|cited permi&s;&s;ion to tran&s;cribe it for the pre&s;s, which its author could &s;carcely be prevailed on to con&s;ent to.&mdash;It is printed verbatim from the original.</P>
<P>The "Po&s;t&s;cript to Peter Porcupine" expo&s;es only the mo&s;t glaring of the fal&s;ehoods, ab&s;urdities, contradictions, and incon&s;i&s;tencies, with which the pamphlet of his "Life and Adventures" abounds; but which mu&s;t at once &s;trip it of every particle of credit for authenticity which it may have ob|tained from the &s;uperficial reader.</P>

<SALUTE>MY DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT your reiterated &s;olicita|tions I have attempted to procure you a faith|ful narrative of the life and tran&s;actions of that mercenary incendiary who for &s;ome time pa&s;t has been, by <HI>foreign</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;tance, <HI>forcing</HI> him&s;elf into notice, on the theatre of American poli|tics. After a mo&s;t vigilant &s;earch, I have procured, be&s;ides other authentic documents, a rough &s;ketch of his life, drawn up by him&s;elf in a paroxy&s;m of de&s;pair, when the gallows &s;tared him in the face; but, as he e&s;|caped puni&s;hment at that time, he has been as careful to prevent its publication as "<HI>exi&s;ting circum&s;tances</HI>" would permit. The gentleman
<PB N="6" REF="030553_0007_0FE7C97184B3EF08">from whom I have procured that manu&s;cript, got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it at a time when its wretched author had not wherewithal to procure him a hiding-place from the &s;torm. He wi&s;hed my friend to dige&s;t it for publication, expecting by that means to procure a little money, but before it could be got ready for pre&s;s, its owner reque&s;ted its &s;uppre&s;&s;ion; nor would I at this time have procured the loan of it, had not the brazen-faced Porcupine declared in my friend's company, when he mentioned it in a jocular manner, that he never gave it him, and that not a word contained therein was true, with re&s;pect to him: The fal&s;ity of this declaration, I am convinced, will appear as obvious to you as it did to my friend, when you are informed, that it was written and dated in Ip&s;wich jail; at a period when he could have no inducement for making <HI>his crimes</HI> appear more hideous than they really were.</P>
<P>By the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this, and other informa|tion, I have traced him through the compli|cated vici&s;&s;itudes of a life abandoned to every &s;pecies of wickedne&s;s, and recorded the prin|cipal actions of his life as accurately, as con|&s;idering my &s;ources of information, and di&s;|tance from the various &s;cences, could po&s;&s;ibly be done, the&s;e con&s;idered, I will have no oc|ca&s;ion to apologi&s;e for the errors which may unavoidably have place in any part of this letters.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="030553_0008_0FE7C97447F72F40">
<P>HE was born (whether above or below ground I know not) on the e&s;tate of that ce|lebrated Engli&s;h peer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Lan&s;dale</NOTE> whom Peter Pindar lately recommended to the Royal Academy of London, as a &s;uitable repre&s;entation of the <HI>Devil,</HI> if they wi&s;hed to procure <HI>a &s;triking like|ne&s;s</HI> of the "<HI>Sovereign Lord and King</HI>" of the internal regions. This <HI>effigy</HI> of his Satanic Maje&s;ty became the Porcupine's ma&s;ter; for by the law which at that period exi&s;ted in England, the children of miners became the property of the per&s;on to whom their parents belonged. From this &s;tate of bondage, the decea&s;e of the father before the 14th year of the child's exi&s;tence could only relea&s;e it, for as the women on the death of their hu&s;band's were declared <HI>free,</HI> immemorial cu&s;tom had con&s;idered the offspring as the mother's pro|perty, if it had not attained the above-men|tioned age. The&s;e children were generally received into the pari&s;h workhou&s;e, but &s;tar|vation &s;tared the mother in the face, and &s;he had no alternative but that of returning to her &s;ubterraneous employment.</P>
<P>Unfortunately for the Porcupine, ere he had attained the eighth year of his age his <HI>reputed</HI> father departed this life, in con&s;equence of a brui&s;e he received by the falling of a huge rock of coal; and in the year 1774 the Por|cupine emerged from the coal-pit, which, for &s;ucceffive generations, had contained the cradle
<PB N="8" REF="030553_0009_0FE7C97A2A5591F8">and the death-bed of his ance&s;tors&mdash;Unfortu|nately for the Porcupine, I &s;ay, was this pre|mature death of his father, for had it not hap|pened, he might have pa&s;&s;ed from the womb to "that bourne from whence no traveller re|turns," in oblivion; but for this fatal accident, the "political pilots of America" would have been under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;teering their ve&s;&s;el without the aid and guidance of a "<HI>bloody buoy,</HI>" and an Engli&s;h whipping-po&s;t would not have been <HI>graced</HI> with the carca&s;e of the Porcupine; but for it, the Executive of the United States would never have been puffed with the <HI>flatter|ing panegyrics</HI> of this di&s;hone&s;t hypocritical wretch, nor would an Engli&s;h judge have been under the nece&s;&s;ity of pa&s;&s;ing on him a &s;entence of death; but for it, the light-fingered tribe would have lacked a &s;kilful a&s;&s;ociate, and his Britannic Maje&s;ty an <HI>able</HI> agent.</P>
<P>The Porcupine, on his arrival <HI>above</HI> ground, was admitted into the pari&s;h work-hou&s;e, thro' the influence of a very cha itable lady in the neighbourhood; and his mother having ac|cepted the hand of another <HI>pit-mate,</HI> returned to her former &s;lavery. The Porcupine had not been long in the work-hou&s;e, until that covetuous di&s;po&s;ition, which has accompanied him in an <HI>eminent</HI> degree through life, began to appear, but for a while it was confined to the toys, &amp;c. of his companions. During the fir&s;t two years he was in the work-hou&s;e, he made a very rapid progre&s;s in his education;
<PB N="9" REF="030553_0010_0FE7C97BB56D0C38">but as he advanced in years, he advanced likewi&s;e in roguery, he had been often con|victed of petty thefts, yet his in&s;inuating ad|dre&s;s, and progre&s;s in learning counterbalanced his bad actions with his too-credulous teachers, and he often e&s;caped the puni&s;hment his crimes de&s;erved.</P>
<P>He had been nearly four years in the work|hou&s;e when he commenced his depradations on its proyerty, and on that of its officers: Our hero has, throughout his whole life, been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an unconquerable propen&s;ity for &s;tealing, and drinking &s;trong liquors&mdash;Several &s;mall articles had from time to time di&s;appeared from the work-hou&s;e, and the Porcupine had frequently been ob&s;erved to be in liquor. Once, in particular, having found means to convey a bra&s;s goblet from the governor's kitchen, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of one of tho&s;e mon&s;ters who are to be found in all the towns in England, who&s;e who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s is to purcha&s;e &s;tolen goods, and to encourage youth to &s;teal, he converted the goblet into ca&s;h, and part of that into gin, with which he got drunk; and returning to the work-hou&s;e, yet intoxicated, he went directly to the governor's kitchen, and told the cook that he ob&s;erved one of the boys on the road to town with a goblet under his arm; <HI>inquiring</HI> if it be|longed to the work-hou&s;e. The goblet being, in con&s;equence, immediately mi&s;&s;ed, and in|formation thereof given to the governor, he ordered the boy charged with the crime to be
<PB N="10" REF="030553_0011_0FE7C98182A9F9F0">brought before him, when low! it appeared that he had not been without the gates of the gates of the work-hou&s;e that day: The Por|cupine was con&s;equently caught in the &s;nare he had laid for another&mdash;the charge of theft reverted to him, who was brought before the governor, but the gin having commenced its operation, he was &s;peechle&s;s, in a &s;tate of ine|briation, di&s;graceful at any age, but more &s;o at his. Next day, the treble crimes of theft, drunkenne&s;s, and lying, procured him a mo&s;t &s;evere cha&s;ti&s;ement: his credit in the work|hou&s;e was at an end; and from that day he formed the de&s;ign of leaving it the fir&s;t favou|rable opportunity.</P>
<P>Some time in the &s;pring of 1780, the year in which he commenced pocket-picking, he found means to extract from a countryman's pocket, who had come to town to attend a fair, a few &s;hillings. Con&s;cious of detection if he did not leave the work-hou&s;e immediately, and already &s;ufficiently tired of its confinement, he determined to depart as &s;oon after &s;upper as he conveniently could, for, by &s;o doing, he would have a night's travelling before his go|ing off would be known.</P>
<P>His memory was at this time pretty reten|tive&mdash;his late &s;evere flogging he had not for|got&mdash;he had likewi&s;e perfect remembrance of another recent di&s;grace, which, though not &s;o <HI>corporeally</HI> painful, got him the hootings, hi&s;|&s;ings and contemptuous jeerings of all his com|panions;
<PB N="11" REF="030553_0012_0FE7C9839C5D7D68">the&s;e, had he not been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a heart &s;o naturally prone to thieving, <HI>might</HI> have &s;uperinduced a repri&s;al, before his <HI>final</HI> leave on the body of the object of his ven|geance; but the property, rather than the body, of the per&s;on who, when fulfilling his duty, he &s;uppo&s;ed had injured him, was his object; and as he had neither clothes nor money to over|burden him when travelling, a little addition to the production of his fir&s;t <HI>public</HI> e&s;&s;ay, he was determined to attempt procuring; with this view, he employed the evening in &s;chem|ing, and while the governor, teachers, &amp;c. were &s;uping, he put his &s;chemes in execution; the governe&s;s's chamber was the fir&s;t object of his examination&mdash;in it he could di&s;cover no|thing worth carrying off, &s;ave an antique re|peating watch, which was immediately &s;ecured &mdash;the governor's was next in cour&s;e, and after &s;trict examination, a &s;olitary <HI>Queen Ann's</HI> half|guinea, which its owner had long kept as an object of curio&s;ity, was the only thing he could find worthy of capture:&mdash;The rooms of the teachers came next under review, but none of the precious metals were to be found in them; however, he determined they &s;hould not fare better for that: In one room he thought a change from the work-hou&s;e dre&s;s would pre|vent his being &s;topped when travelling, and in the other, a determination to de&s;troy, as he could not carry off, entered his malicious mind. The be&s;t &s;uit belonging to the junior teacher
<PB N="12" REF="030553_0013_0FE7C989659A8E70">he cut in pieces with a pen-knife he found in the room, and from that of the &s;enior he car|ried off a black cloth coat, a pair of black &s;attin breeches, and a three-cocked hat, with the&s;e under his arm he &s;allied forth from the work-hou&s;e, and continued walking, nor dared to look behind him, till he was at lea&s;t a mile di&s;tant from his late home. Here he &s;toped for the purpo&s;e of &s;hifting&mdash;you may ea&s;ily conceive what a ridiculous figure a youth of his years would make in &s;uch a dre&s;s.</P>
<P>The teacher's po&s;teriors were equal in &s;ize to tho&s;e of any man in this city, and his coat would have been too large for Mr. Sedgwick; not with &s;tanding which, this offspring of a coal-pit union determined to change his dre&s;s, and having thrown into an adjoining meadow-drain the principal part of his work-hou&s;e uniform, he equipped him&s;elf in the clothes he had &s;tole, and, in that ridiculous dre&s;s, he &s;et off for Bir|mingham. On the road he committed &s;everal petty acts of theft; the people &s;uppo&s;ing he had e&s;caped from &s;ome mad-hou&s;e, were not very watchful of their property when he en|tered their dwellings.</P>
<P>He arrived at that town about eight o'clock in the morning, in the &s;ame ludicrous dre&s;s, which arre&s;ted the attention of every eye: A huge old-fa&s;hioned very fine cocked hat, and a pair of wooden-&s;oaled work-hou&s;e manufac|tured, &s;hoes&mdash;a &s;uperfine very large black cloth coat, and a coar&s;e grey cloth work-hou&s;e jacket
<PB N="13" REF="030553_0014_0FE7C98B8FAB7980">&mdash;a pair of very large and fine &s;attin breeches, and a pair of the coar&s;e&s;t grey work-hou&s;e &s;tockings&mdash;a very rich antique watch-chain dangling on his thigh, and a great notty oak-branch in his hand, were contra&s;ts &s;o truly &s;triking, as to have a very vi&s;ible effect on the vi&s;ible faculties of every beholder.</P>
<P>A member of a gang of thieves, who had for &s;ome time infe&s;ted Birmingham, acco&s;ted our young hero, and very &s;oon di&s;covered him to be of "<HI>the &s;ort;</HI>" he therefore carried him before their &s;cheming committee, by the una|nimous voice of whom, he was admitted a member of their a&s;&s;ociation, and from whom he received a complete change of dre&s;s. What became of the repeater he never knew, and its lo&s;s he has often lamented. Under the tuition of the&s;e <HI>light-fingered gentlemen,</HI> however, he &s;oon became a proficient in the <HI>art</HI> of pick|ing locks and every &s;pecies of thieving. He continued in this place near twelve months; during which he a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in robbing the &s;tores, &amp;c. of &s;everal capital merchants, and always &s;hared equal in the booty. Early in the year 1781, an end was put to this a&s;&s;ocia|tion, by &s;ome of the gang being &s;eized in the act of breaking open the cellar of an inn, and the rogues not having confidence in one ano|ther, for per&s;onal &s;afety a retreat was unavoid|able. He, therefore, with a companion of the trade, left Birmingham the morning after &s;aid detection, determining to carry on on their own
<PB N="14" REF="030553_0015_0FE7C990DDA34BA8">account, and took the road to Oxford. Near Coventry, they fell in with a chai&s;e and four, containing a young lady and her inamorato, on their way to Gretna Green, and having &s;topped the carriage, the loving couple, alarmed at the appearance of a ru&s;ty pi&s;tol without a lock, delivered to the robbers, all their ca&s;h, con|&s;i&s;ting of nearly 200 guineas; how the lovers were to proceed, or whether the Caledonian <HI>hor&s;e-&s;hoeing</HI> divine would unite them in the holy bands of matrimony without the <HI>appear|ance</HI> of a pur&s;e, were objects which never &s;truck the minds of either of the&s;e hard-heart|ed followers of Phorbas. They &s;lept that night, and breakfa&s;ted next morning, in the hou&s;e of of a poor, but hone&s;t and indu&s;trious, country|man, from which, not with &s;tanding, they took care not to depart without a prize. The la|borious man being up at the dawn of day to his work, when the un&s;u&s;pecting woman was empleyed preparing breakfa&s;t, a &s;it opportu|nity offered, and the mon&s;ters, callous to every feeling of humanity, picked the locks of an ancient bureau, and extracted therefrom one guinea and three half-crown pieces, which were carefully wrapped up in rags, and depo|&s;ited in a corner of one the drawers, undoubt|edly a part of the hard earnings which the in|du&s;trious couple had collected for the purpo&s;es of paying their rent and the teacher's quar|terly bills for the education of their children: they departed un&s;u&s;pected, after paying the
<PB N="15" REF="030553_0016_0FE7C99300FB0D88">good woman he moderate charge, and receiv|ing her hearty thanks; this day they dined at a tavern, from which they carried off a &s;ilver pot. They arrived at Oxford that &s;ame night, in which city they re&s;ided &s;ome time: during which they broke open, a variety of haber|da&s;hers, mens mercers, hardware and jewellery &s;hops, &amp;c. the products of which they ea&s;ily di&s;po&s;ed of, as our hero takes notice, in the manu&s;cript already mentioned, that "he never was in any town two days without di&s;cover|ing &s;ome place for the di&s;po&s;al of &s;tolen goods."</P>
<P>The accomplices in villainy had not been in <HI>partner&s;hip</HI> &s;ix months, when, in con&s;equence of a difference re&s;pecting the divi&s;ion of &s;ome booty, they determined to &s;eparate, but not before each had &s;olemnly &s;wore never to be|come volunteer evidence again&s;t the other. It was the Poroupine's lot to leave Oxford; he therefore &s;et off with the intention of going to London, but having &s;topped a few days at Ban|bury fair, he picked &s;everal pockets, &s;tole two or three pieces of cloth, &s;everal pairs of gloves, &s;tockings, &amp;c. which occa&s;ioned his return to Oxford to di&s;po&s;e of them. During his ab|&s;ence, a reward of 50 guineas had been ad|verti&s;ed for the di&s;covery of the per&s;ons guilty of a late daring robbery, and if one of the de|linquents made the di&s;covery, he was to re|ceive pardon as well as the reward. It was the la&s;t robbery that the Porcupine and his companion had been jointly guilty of, and the
<PB N="16" REF="030553_0017_0FE7C9984FFC6458">promi&s;e of pardon and reward induced him to break his &s;olemn engagement by making di&s;|covery of his companion in iniquity. As the the a&s;&s;izes were &s;itting the trial &s;peedily com|menced, but, <HI>unfortunately</HI> for the Porcupine, he could not re&s;train his hands even in the court; when retiring from giving his evidence, he was caught in the act of picking a gentle|man's pocket&mdash;he was accordingly committed to jail; his trial came on before the a&s;&s;ize ro&s;e, and he and his companion were found guilty; the latter, on account of the magnitude of his crime, death&mdash;and the former, on account of his youth, got off with a &s;entence of impri&s;on|ment "for &s;ix months, and receiving on the fir&s;t Friday of the fir&s;t, third, and fifth months, 100 la&s;hes on his naked back, by the hands of the common hangman." This puni&s;hment had no other effect on the Porcupine than that of hardening him in iniquity. The period of his confinement had no &s;ooner expired, than he &s;et off again for London; when he arrived there, he had in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, in addition to what he carried from Oxford, about 20 yards printed calicoe, I piece book mu&s;lin, 4 large &s;hawls, a quantity of ribbons, gloves, &s;tockings, &amp;c. a &s;ilver watch, two &s;ilver table-&s;poons, one &s;il|ver porter-mug, be&s;ides &s;ome ca&s;h, all of which he picked up at the different hou&s;es he halted at on the road.

Shortly after his arrival in that city, he became, and con|tinued during his &s;tay, the <HI>protector</HI> of one of the fair dames of St. Giles's, who &s;upplied him very liberally with drink and money; but he and a companion being on a foot-pad expe|dition in the neighbourhood of London, one evening, they &s;toped a carriage, and demanded the money of a gentleman who was in it, which he having refu&s;ed, the companion of the Por|cupine fired in at one door, which mi&s;&s;ing the gentleman, wounded our hero at the other, who was immediately apprehended and conducted to pri&s;on. Next court he was tried, and re|ceived &s;entence to be &s;logged at the cart's tail, and impri&s;oned three months in Tothilfields Bridewell. On his liberation he &s;et off for Canterbury, on the road to which picked up &s;everal &s;mall articles of value, and by his cun|ning addre&s;s, prevailed on the daughter of a farmer, at who&s;e hou&s;e he tarried one night, to &s;leep with him, and in the morning carried off her father's watch and two guineas, which had been carele&s;sly left in the parlour over night.

<P>Having arrived at Canterbury, he com|menced his old trade, and was pretty &s;ucce&s;|ful, but a &s;earch being &s;et on foot, his narrow e&s;cape from the officers of ju&s;tice, induced him to enter in the &s;ervice of "<HI>The Defender of the Faith,</HI>" by inli&s;ting in one of his regi|ments of infantry, which was &s;hortly after commanded to prepare for a voyage to Ame|rica; before the time fixed for their departure, however, the negociations for peace com|menced, the order for embarkation was coun|termanded, and the regiment ordered to Glou|ce&s;tor, where he continued &s;ome time; when being ordered to Leice&s;tor on a recruiting party he began again to &s;teal. The day of their arrival, he and other two of the party took a trunk from behind a carriage, in the vicinity of that town, which contained &s;everal articles of great value. In this place they re&s;ided &s;e|veral months, during which he married a daughter of the tavern-keeper on whom he was billetted.</P>
<P>The party being ordered to join the regi|ment, on their return through Birmingham, he &s;elt in with &s;ome of his old acquaintances, in who&s;e company the night he was there was &s;pent in the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;everal petty acts of theft.

<PB N="19" REF="030553_0020_0FE7C9A25D799BC8">
<P>Shortly after this, having met one night in the &s;treets with one of his officers in a &s;tate of intoxication, he, being <HI>as u&s;ual</HI> di&s;gui&s;ed, at|tacked and robbed him of his watch and mo|ney; he then left him, went for his uniform, and returning to the officer led him home. This unfortunate man's property again temp|ted the rapacious villain, and he took off a few &s;hirts, &amp;c. which he found in the room. The&s;e he was careful to di&s;po&s;e of that night, but he thought him&s;elf &s;afe enough with the watch; he was however mi&s;taken: the officer had per|fect recollection which &s;oldier it was who &s;aw him home, and upon mi&s;&s;ing his &s;hirts, he or|dered a &s;trict &s;earch to be made at the Porcu|pine's lodging&mdash;his &s;hirts could not be found, but his watch unexpectedly was: The unfor|tunate wretch was immediately took under guard, and &s;hortly after tried by a court-mar|tial, who &s;entenced him to receive, which he actually did, 500 la&s;hes. He de&s;erted imme|diately after his recovery, and went directly to Derby. The &s;ame night that he arrived there he &s;tole from a &s;hop a va&s;t number of &s;ilk handkerchiefs, and next night, from another &s;hop he took &s;ome bundles of &s;tockings, &s;ome dozen pair of gloves, and other &s;mall articles; with the&s;e he travelled the country as a haw|ker, and &s;tealing whenever an opportunity of|fered. In the cour&s;e of this journey, he fell in with a fellow rogue, who advi&s;ed him to commence coiner; the two accordingly &s;et to
<PB N="20" REF="030553_0021_0FE7C9A7A3DA63F8">work, and having fini&s;hed a quantity of money they &s;eparated. The hero, of this letter was &s;oon after this apprehended at Notingham for pa&s;&s;ing bad money, but the magi&s;trates, not knowing he was a de&s;erter, agreed not to pro|&s;ecute him if he would enli&s;t in the army; this he con&s;ented to, and immediatly joined a re|giment then in town. He had not been long in this regiment until he was &s;ent on a recruit|ing party into the county of Stafford; he had no &s;ooner, however, been &s;eperated from the main body than he determined to de&s;ert. He picked the lock of a trunk belonging to the owner of the fir&s;t hou&s;e he was billeted in, and exchanged his regimentals for a &s;uit of his land|lord's; this done, he &s;et off for Birmingham; when he arrived there, hearing of the fatal end of a number of his companions, and recol|lecting his own hair-breadth e&s;capes, he re|&s;olved to follow thieving no longer: With this view he &s;ought out for a footman's place in &s;ome gentleman's family. He was of a good appearance, which by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a for|ged certificate of good character, got him in|to the &s;ervice of a young gentleman who was going to make the tour of Europe, and they ecordingly &s;et off for France. His not know|ing the French language was a great incon|venience to his ma&s;ter, who, therefore deter|mined to be at the expence of teaching him. They &s;pent a long time in vi&s;iting the different towns in the north of France; but the wretch
<PB N="21" REF="030553_0022_0FE7C9A930519160">had no &s;ooner acquired a knowledge of the language, which was highly plea&s;ing to his ma&s;ter, than he determined to return to Eng|land. Since he had been in this gentleman's &s;er|vice, he conducted him&s;elf hone&s;tly, or at lea&s;t if he did &s;teal, it was not di&s;covered, this ho|ne&s;t di&s;po&s;ition, however, did not long conti|nue &mdash;his ma&s;ter having gone out with &s;ome companions on a party of plea&s;ure for two days, he, being an un&s;u&s;picious man, left him the charge of his clothes and money, but he had no &s;ooner gone, than having put the money and mo&s;t valuable part of his ma&s;ter's wardrobe into one trunk, he took it with him and &s;et off immediately for Calais, from thence to Dover, and from Dover to Bath, without &s;topping a a longer time than was nece&s;&s;ary at any place on the road. His going to Bath, he &s;ays in the before-mentioned manu&s;cript, was for the purpo&s;e of making his fortune, by marrying an heire&s;s! Had this happened, he adds, he would really have lived <HI>hone&s;t</HI> and <HI>&s;ober</HI> ever after; but fortunately for the ladies, he could not re&s;train his hands from &s;tealing when there.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of a con&s;tant attendance at the card-room, a &s;how of ca&s;h, a va&s;t &s;tock of impudence, and a &s;mattering of French, he got intimate with &s;everal young gentlemen, one of whom having lo&s;t very con&s;iderably at play, was enabled by a pre&s;ent of the Porcu|pine's to continue, and in the end came off gainer; this <HI>genero&s;ity,</HI> as the young gentleman
<PB N="22" REF="030553_0023_0FE7C9AF02CEE710">thought it, induced him to invite our hero to his father's hou&s;e next night to tea, which was complied with, and the vi&s;its often repeated, in the conr&s;e of which, he pretended to be deeply &s;mitten with the charms of the young gentleman's &s;i&s;ter, and made her &s;everal rich pre&s;ents. His endeavours were &s;ucce&s;sful&mdash;ugly as he is, he &s;ays he won her heart, and had he de&s;i&s;ted from robbery for two weeks, he might have been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an amiable and accompli&s;hed lady with a hand&s;ome for|tune; but being apprehended attempting to rob the &s;tage between Bath and Cricklade, an end was put to the affair.</P>
<P>On examination, one of his accomplices &s;erved him ju&s;t as he did his old companion at Oxford, by turning evidence for the crown, in con&s;equence of which, three indictments for capital crimes were found again&s;t him. That for robbing the &s;tage was fir&s;t tried, and the evidence being clear, he was found guilty, and &s;entenced to be <HI>banged!</HI> but the di&s;turbance between England and Spain, re&s;pecting Nootka Sound, breaking out at this time, he received a pardon on condition of joining one of the regiments ordered for Gibraltar; this he gladly con&s;ented to. He was kept confined till they were ready to embark, at which he and &s;everal others were marched under a &s;trong guard for Port&s;mouth to be put aboard the tran&s;ports which were lying at that place; but on the way, the Porcupine found means to e&s;|cape
<PB N="23" REF="030553_0024_0FE7C9B12A2805D0">from his guard, and went to London, from whence fear of di&s;covery made him take immediate &s;hipping for Dublin. He arrived in that city with an empty pur&s;e, but not hav|ing forgot his old trade, he the evening of his arrival, picked a gentleman's pocket of about &s;eventy pounds in ca&s;h and bank-notes, and continued his depradations during his &s;tay in that town. By his attendance at the places of public amu&s;ement, he got acquaint with &s;everal genteel families, in particular, he be|came intimate in the family of a re&s;pectable citizen, the elde&s;t daughter of whom he paid the clo&s;eft attention, and &s;oon prevailed upon her to con&s;ent to marriage, although her fa|ther had refu&s;ed his con&s;ent. He took lodg|ings for her in Parliament &s;treet, and lived in the mid&s;t of plenty and plea&s;ure for &s;ome time; notwith&s;tanding which, he was no le&s;s a&s;&s;idu|ous in his attention to another young lady, in the out-&s;kirts of the city, with who&s;e parents he pa&s;&s;ed for the &s;on of an Engli&s;h gentleman of fortune. He made her &s;everal very valu|able pre&s;ents, and &s;he received him in a favou|rable manner; but, when the young lady was on the point of yielding to his &s;olicitations, her father having a&s;&s;ented to the plan, which was to &s;et off on the morning of their marriage, to <HI>his father's e&s;tate</HI> in England, an accident hap|pened, which, though it &s;toped the marriage, ruined the lady. In one of their walks in her father's garden, when drawing out his hand|kerchief
<PB N="24" REF="030553_0025_0FE7C9B65E687838">he dropped a letter from one of his old companions, then under &s;entence of death in England. She took no notice of it, and he not ob&s;erving it, it lay till &s;he had an op|portunity of picking it up and peru&s;ing its contents, which made her acquaint with his true character.</P>
<P>At his next interview &s;he laid the letter be|fore him&mdash;in vain did he invent a variety of excu&s;es, &s;uch as finding it, &amp;c. it was directed to him, &s;he remarked, and &s;he concluded by telling him, &s;he was determined never to &s;ee him again&mdash;it would have been well for her, if &s;he had continued firm in her determination. He now re&s;olved to leave Ireland without the knowledge of his <HI>wife</HI>; before which, how|ever, he wi&s;hed to &s;ee the young lady who had found the letter, and that he might accompli&s;h this, he wrote her a letter, reque&s;ting her to meet him that evening at nine o'clock, near her father's gate (for he dur&s;t not go within it now), that he might <HI>explain</HI> what had happened. This &s;he unfortunately complied with: he tied his hor&s;e to a tree, and they walked on a little way; he endeavoured to reconcile matters, but to no purpo&s;e. He then threw her down, and having &s;tuffed his handkerchief in her mouth, ravi&s;hed, and afterwards robbed her&mdash;left her almo&s;t &s;en&s;ele&s;s, and never &s;aw her more.</P>
<P>He then made for his hor&s;e, which having mounted, he rode off directly for Donaghadee, at which place he embarked for Port-Patrick,
<PB N="25" REF="030553_0026_0FE7C9BA398FCB48">from whence he &s;et off for Carli&s;le, at which place he continued &s;ome time pur&s;uing his old trade, and continuing his old licentious way of life. He &s;educed a &s;ervant maid, and after|wards induced her to live with him; notwith|&s;tanding which, he paid his addre&s;&s;es to a young lady in the neighbourhood, but finding her father prejudiced again&s;t his very appear|ance, and re&s;olved to have no connection what|ever with him, he changed his de&s;ign, and prevailed on the young lady to &s;ubmit to his lu&s;tful de&s;ires. Her father, irritated at her di&s;obedience, determined to put an effectual &s;top to any future interviews, and had her con|fined to her chamber. She however contrived to corre&s;pond with him, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a female &s;ervant, and in her letters earne&s;tly in|treated him to form &s;ome plan to convey her from her pri&s;on; but as he was not ha&s;ty in di&s;covering one, &s;he reque&s;ted him, by letter, as her window-&s;hutters were fa&s;tened, to come at midnight with a rope, mount to the top of the hou&s;e, and let the rope down the chimney of her chamber, to which &s;he promi&s;ed to tie her clothes and money, after that was drawn up, and the rope again let down, &s;he was to fa&s;ten her&s;elf. He repaired to the hou&s;e at the hour appointed, which he very ea&s;ily mounted by a peat-&s;tack and a &s;table which were rai&s;ed at one of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> gables; having hoi&s;ted her money and clothes, he let the rope down again, not with intention of carrying off mi&s;s, for as he
<PB N="26" REF="030553_0027_0FE7C9BFF5660F28">could not procure her e&s;tate, &s;he had no more charms for him; however, not &s;u&s;pecting his intention, &s;he fa&s;tened her&s;elf to the rope, and he having hoi&s;ted her about half-way up, he fa&s;tened it round the chimney-top, and went off with her clothes and money, leaving her in that &s;ooty &s;ituation to reftect on her credu|lity. By this treacherous nocturnal expedi|tion, he acquired clothes, ornaments, a watch, &amp;c. of nearly 150l. value, and in ca&s;h about 53 guineas, with which, to avoid another whipping-po&s;t exhibition, he took a moon|light leave of Carli&s;le; taking care, however, to carry likewi&s;e with him, from his own lod|gings, whatever could conveniently be done, without giving his Cumberland dear "<HI>in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion</HI>" cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect his intention of elope|ment. At Brampton he di&s;pofed of the goods. He continued in this place about 10 days, &s;tealing whenever an opportunity occurred. Having entered the hou&s;e of an aged widow woman one night, he demanded of her where her money lay, the woman told him &s;he had none; however, he ob&s;erved a watch, which when attempting to take, &s;he laid hold of him by the arm, be&s;eeching him not to take it&mdash;it had been her hu&s;band's before &s;he knew him, &s;he &s;aid, and &s;he had kept it with the greate&s;t care &s;ince his death&mdash;it was an agreeable com|panion in her hours of &s;olitude, &s;he added, and begged him to leave it. The callous mon&s;ter irritated at her holding him, &s;truck her with a
<PB N="27" REF="030553_0028_0FE7C9C1850D80B8">&s;hort bludgeon which he always carried with him, and laid her lifele&s;s at his &s;eet. He then took the watch, and even riffled the unfortu|nate woman's pockets. Having locked the door, he made off for Litchfield, where falling in with a branch of the grand a&s;&s;ociation, they carried on the bu&s;ine&s;s on an exten&s;ive plan for three months; churches, dwelling-hou&s;es, &s;hops, cellars, &amp;c. all were examined in turn by this band of ru&s;&s;ians. Their attack on the country-hou&s;e of an exten&s;ive whole&s;ale mer|chant is particularly worthy of notice: it was &s;ituated about three miles from Litchfield, and as nobody was left to take care of the hou&s;e during winter, the rogues had an opportunity to empty it of almo&s;t every thing it contained; they took a cart with them, and having picked the locks, rumaged the hou&s;e, and loaded their cart with the mo&s;t valuable articles they could find, which they immediately took to town. Next day, while two of the gang were ob&s;erving whether any of the family went to the hou&s;e, the others were employed di&s;po&s;ing of what they had &s;tole. At night they paid the hou&s;e another vi&s;it, and carried off another cart-load of the mo&s;t valuable and portable articles which it then contained. For three weeks this ex|traordinary robbery remained undi&s;covered, and even then the perpetrators were not known. In the mean time, the&s;e villains had broke in|to two of the pari&s;h churches and a di&s;&s;enting meeting hou&s;e, from each of which the carried
<PB N="28" REF="030553_0029_0FE7C9C6AF0D49C0">off the communion-cups, &amp;c. &s;tripped the pul|pits and covered pews, and took from one of the churches a large folio bible full of notes, which they burnt. The ve&s;t number of hou&s;e and &s;hop-breakings, and other daring robbe|ries lately committed in this town, occa&s;ioned a &s;trict &s;earch to be &s;et on foot, particularly among&s;t &s;trangers, in con&s;equence of which, two of the gang were apprehended, but our hero and the other e&s;caped; he did not, how|ever, leave town, he was doomed to grace the Litchfield whipping-po&s;t. On the next mar|ket day, ob&s;erving a countryman with a pur&s;e|ful of guineas, he determined to attempt pro|curing it, and following him till an opportu|nity occurred, he decoyed the &s;imple fellow into an alley, then knocked him down, and robbed him of his all; but he had not left him long when the dreadful cries of the unfortunate man alarmed &s;ome people in the adjoining hou&s;es; a purfuit was accordingly made, and the Porcupine was &s;eized and committed to jail; before he was apprehended, however, he had di&s;po&s;ed of the pur&s;e &s;ome way. He was &s;oon after tried, and found guilty&mdash;he was &s;en|tenced to three months impri&s;onment, and to receive 50 la&s;hes under the gallows. It was a fortunate circum&s;tance for him, that nothing tran&s;pired in the cour&s;e of the trial, re&s;pecting the late robberies&mdash;had he been convicted of them he would undoubtedly have met with that &s;ate he has &s;o long de&s;erved.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="030553_0030_0FE7C9C8DF718F80">
<P>Afraid of a di&s;covery which would put an effectual &s;top to his career, he petitioned to be allowed to enli&s;t, which being granted, he en|tered with a company then in town, belonging to a regiment lying at Ip&s;wich, to which he was immediately &s;ent with &s;ome other recruits. At a fair they halted one day trying to procure more recruits, and our hero prevailed on his guard to take off his hand cuffs, which being done, he went to the fair, at which he picked a farmer's pocket of about 20 guineas, 6 of which he gave to his comrades. Having ar|rived at Ip&s;wich, and being re&s;tored to the <HI>li|berty</HI> of a <HI>Briti&s;h &s;oldier,</HI> he began again to &s;teal. It would require a volume to contain a parti|cular account of the crimes he committed du|ring his &s;tay in this town. Shortly after he arrived, he married a &s;ervant girl; this wretch, who has been guilty of &s;o many enormities, made no &s;eruple to break through the holy bands of matrimony whenever it &s;uited his purpo&s;es. At this time he had wives in various parts of England, and one in Ireland; be&s;ides which, he had ruined a number of young wo|men, who never had the honour of being united to him by wedlock's &s;acred ties.</P>
<P>The Porcupine having with &s;everal of his fellow-foldiers, broke into the &s;tore of an ex|ten&s;ive whole&s;ale merchant, and carried off a quantity of goods, ca&s;h, bills, &amp;c. to a very con&s;iderable amount. The Porcupine knew this could not remain long undi&s;covered, and
<PB N="30" REF="030553_0031_0FE7C9CEA8C1BF10">being more provident than his companions, he arranged matters &s;o as to procure his &s;hare in ca&s;h, and with the addition of a watch, a few guineas, and a complete change of dre&s;s, be|longing to the owner of the hou&s;e in which he was billeted, he made off directly for New|market, at which place the races were to com|mence the next week.</P>
<P>This daring robbery was the occa&s;ion of a very &s;trict &s;earch, and a few of the Porcupine's companions were among tho&s;e apprehended on &s;u&s;picion. Some of the goods being found in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and one of their accomplices having become king's evidence, a full di&s;clo|&s;ure was made. A reward was offered for ap|prehending our hero, by the military as well as civil authority, and he was arre&s;ted and dragged out of an a&s;&s;embly, at which he had promi&s;ed him&s;elf the be&s;t crops he had yet reaped, and &s;ent to pri&s;on. He was &s;oon af|ter &s;ent under a military guard to Ip&s;wich, and lodged in jail. It was while lying there, under the horrors of a guilty con&s;cience, and expec|ting the gallows as the reward of his crimes, that he wrote the manu&s;cript I mentioned at the begianing of this letter.</P>
<P>He had not lain long there when he and his companions were tried by a court-martial, and he and another was &s;entenced to receive 1000 la&s;hes each, to be drummed out of the regi|ment, and to be delivered over to the civil law. They &s;tood 700 the fir&s;t time, and as &s;oon as
<PB N="31" REF="030553_0032_0FE7A75DF0B2B490">they were able, they got the remainder, were drummed out of the regiment, and again com|mitted to jail; but the humane gentlemen who fu&s;tained the principal lo&s;s wi&s;hing to decline any further pro&s;ecution, they had their choice whether to &s;tand trial, or to join the Queen's Rangers, Botany Bay, or the Royal Americans, Nova Scotia, in either of which latter ca&s;es, they were never to return to Great-Britain. The Porcupine made choice of Nova Scotia, and his companion of Botany Bay. After our hero arrived at the place of his choice, he ex|erted his talents to procure a little ca&s;h, with the intention of making off for the United States as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. In them he arrived in the year 1792, and has lived ever &s;ince without any <HI>vi&s;ivle</HI> means of procuring an <HI>ho|ne&s;t livelihood!</HI> it is evident, that he mu&s;t either have &s;tole or been the <HI>&s;ecret</HI> agent of the king his ma&s;ter; I am inclined to believe the latter is his employment, for the wretch hardened in iniquity, who could go to the gallows with compo&s;ure, &s;hudders as the thought of many year's confinement.</P>
<P>I am the more inclined to believe it, as he has &s;uddenly emerged from his late &s;tate of poverty and mi&s;e y, and has opened a &s;hop in this city in <HI>one</HI> of his names; this, however, I have been informed from the be&s;t authority, is only a temporary &s;cheme of the <HI>&s;ervants</HI> of our late "<HI>mo&s;t excellent king,</HI>" to <HI>try the pul&s;e</HI> of the American people!</P>

<P>After expo&s;ing the wretched hovel and the indigence in which your grandfather dwelt, and &s;aying, that all he left behind him was his &s;cythe, his reap-hoop, and his flail, you have the con|&s;cience to tell us that your father was a farmer; and a very &s;ub&s;tantial one he mu&s;t have been too, for you &s;ay that he had dealings with the. London hop-merchants, and mentions his tur|nip crops, his wheat, his barley, his peas, &amp;c. moreover, your father was <HI>a very learned man</HI> for his rank (a farmer); he was perfect in &s;e|veral branches of the mathematics; he under|&s;tood land &s;urveying well, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed <HI>expe|rience</HI> and <HI>under&s;tanding.</HI> The&s;e &s;tories will not do, Peter, for in&s;tead of rai&s;ing you, as you wi&s;h, in the e&s;timation of the public, they mu&s;t have an effect the very rever&s;e, becau&s;e it is
<PB N="34" REF="030553_0035_0FE7C9DD55127478">pretty well known, that farms are not &s;o ea&s;ily acquired in England, and to &s;tock &s;uch a one as you &s;ay he had would require &s;everal hun|dred pounds &s;terling, con&s;equently, you mu&s;t have publi&s;hed a lie, unle&s;s your father pro|cured the ca&s;h &s;ufficient to teach him what you &s;ay he knew, and &s;tock the farm which you &s;ay he had, by &s;ome means which you have thought proper to hide from the public.</P>
<P>You &s;ay your father worked for <HI>two-pence</HI> a-day, when a boy; now &s;uppo&s;ing the did &s;o for 8 years, that is, from 8 to 16 years of age, and &s;pent nothing during that time, neither on eating nor drinking, clothing nor lodging, at the end he would have had neatly 24l. 4s.</P>
<P>Having arrived at the age of 16 (which is at lea&s;t two years before farmer's &s;ervants receive full wages) I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e he got man's wages, or 6d. a-day, and that he worked at that rate for 8 years more, or till he was aged 24, which, if he lived as I have &s;uppo&s;ed he did the fir&s;t 8 years, would amount to 72l. 16s. Thus your father, if he lived the 16 years he was at work <HI>without eating, went naked, and &s;lept without other covering than the canopy of Heaven,</HI> would be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;um of 97l. &s;ter|ling, not one quarter &s;ufficient to place him in the &s;ituation you &s;ay he was; be&s;ides you &s;ay he &s;pent part of his earnings at an evening &s;chool, when he attended it he mu&s;t have had a few rags on; to purcha&s;e them, pay the teach|er's bills, buy books, &amp;c. would require almo&s;t
<PB N="35" REF="030553_0036_0FE7C9DEE1BCAC48">all his earnings. Now, as your grandfather left nothing of value behind him, how did your father get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this farm and &s;tock; or if he had them not, what did you mean by publi&s;hing here that he really had them? was you foolith enough to think any one would believe that in England, however cheap things are, a man could acquire &s;uch a con&s;iderable property <HI>hone&s;tly,</HI> who&s;e annual income never amounted, on an average, to <HI>twenty-&s;even dollars.</HI> No, Peter, this is an age of excessive creduli|ty, but not ju&s;t &s;o bad as you imagine yet.</P>
<P>"How much better would it have been to have told the naked truth," you &s;ay your fa|ther had property, but how he acquired it you do not mention; your be&s;t friends mu&s;t en|tertain &s;u&s;picions, when they read that part of your hi&s;tory. If your father, in the early part of his life <HI>made free</HI> with his neighbour's pro|perty, till he procured &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf as a farmer, you might have mentioned it, it would nor affect <HI>your</HI> character&mdash;chieving is not the &s;in which the Almighty threatens to vi&s;it the third and fourth generation for; and there is little danger to be apprehended for your relations in England, if you have any, &s;eeing you have been &s;o faithful to your &s;ove|reign Lord and King.</P>
<P>You had three brothers you &s;ay; the eld|e&s;t was a <HI>&s;oop-keeper</HI>&mdash;the &s;econd a <HI>farmer,</HI> and the third a &s;oldier in the Ea&s;t-India com|pany's &s;ervice&mdash;If you really had a brother a

Had you mentioned the&s;e things, they would have at lea&s;t given this &s;tory the <HI>appearance</HI> of truth.</P>
<P>But there is no end to your incon&s;i&s;tencies: You &s;ay your religion was that of the Church of England, to which you have ever remained attached. Now, what is attachment to re|ligion? Is it only <HI>&s;aying</HI> you are of that reli|gion, or is it a firm adherence to its creed; if it is the latter why do you &s;ay in another place, that at a particular time you would not have li&s;ted your pen although your <HI>&s;alvation had de|pended on it!</HI> or why do you &s;ay the <HI>name</HI> it bears has attached you to it; if it is the <HI>name</HI> it cannot be the <HI>religion,</HI> for if Unitariani&s;m, was to receive that name, by your own words we mu&s;t believe you would become of that religion, and remain firmly attached to it while it was called by that name, although at pre&s;ent you affect to execrate its adherents.</P>
<P>You &s;ay your <HI>ance&s;tors</HI> were <HI>never</HI> per&s;ecuted for their religious opinions, and con&s;equently had not an oportanity of giving &s;uch a &s;ingular proof of their faith as Dr. Franklin's grand|father, and yet you tell us at the &s;ame time that you <HI>never heard of any of your ance&s;tors</HI> prior to your grandfather&mdash;&s;ure in his day there was no per&s;ecution again&s;t people of his religious
<PB N="37" REF="030553_0038_0FE7C9E64C171F90">opinions in England; but what reliance can we place on any thing you advance in your "Life and Adventures," no man can &s;uppo&s;e you have wrote the <HI>truth,</HI> when they read at its beginning, that, had you been Dr. Franklin, you would not have mentioned &s;omething that he has done, becau&s;e it appears <HI>to you</HI> ridicu|lous.</P>
<P>I now come to that place where you men|tion your attempts to become &s;ailor: Here your fal&s;ehoods appear really evident; you &s;ay, that having gone aboard the Pega&s;us, and ap|plied to its captain for leave to remain in the fleet, then lying at Spithead, you was denied; that you afterwards applied to the Port-Admi|ral, but could not prevail with him either. When you was writing this account of your life, you ought to have recollected, that the time you mention was near the conclu&s;ion of the American war, that it is pretty well known here, that at that time the navy was in greater want of hands than they have been this war; and yet we well know what &s;hifts they have been put to to man their fleets&mdash;we well know that their pre&s;s-gangs have invaded the peace|ful dwellings of many happy families, and car|ried off their hu&s;bands, fathers, and &s;upporters, leaving the mothers and their little ones to pe|ri&s;h! &mdash;who can then &s;uppo&s;e they would re|fu&s;e an able-bodied volunteer.

<P>You have, throughout the account of your life and adventures, many touches of the mar|velous &mdash;the way you &s;ay you &s;pent your time in Chatham barracks is not the lea&s;t &s;o&mdash;you acted differently from any Briti&s;h &s;oldier I ever heard of. Writing a fair hand, you &s;ay, procured you the <HI>honour</HI> of being copye&s;t to Colonel Debieg, but pray how came the commandant of the garri&s;on to know you wrote a fair hand, or that you could write at all&mdash;What, not in all Chatham barracks could be found one, from &s;erjeant to fifer, but William Cobbet, who could write a fair hand&mdash;a pretty picture, indeed, of the Briti&s;h army&mdash;the commandant of Chatham was obliged to make a young man, whom no|body knew, who had come to the place and enli&s;ted, no one knowing for what rea&s;on, his confident and his copye&s;t.

<P>Talking of an affair between the Duke of Richmond and Col.

<P>Having gone with your regiment to Nova Scotia, continued there 7 years, and returned without any adventure worth noticing, you &s;ay, at your own reque&s;t, you was di&s;charged; but, good God, of all the wonderful wonders which appear in the cour&s;e of your life, there is none calculated to excite &s;o hearty a laugh as the concluding clau&s;e of a piece you have in&s;erted in it as your di&s;charge from the army: it &s;ays, "he, in con&s;ideration of <HI>his good beha|hior</HI> and the <HI>&s;ervices</HI> he has rendered the regi|ment, <HI>is hereby di&s;charged!!!</HI>" This is indeed a &s;trange reward for &s;ervices rendered&mdash;Why was you not promoted&mdash;"promotion (you &s;ay) is the reward of merit in the Briti&s;h army."&mdash; No man in his &s;ober &s;en&s;es would, for a mo|ment, &s;uppo&s;e that a di&s;charge would be the con&s;equence of good behavior&mdash;No, no, Peter, no man will believe that di&s;charge to be au|thentic, unle&s;s they &s;ee the original, with Lord

<P>How fooli&s;hly you triumph after producing what you call a copy of your di&s;charge&mdash;you a&s;&s;ert that your character was good, and hope it will be looked upon as &s;uch, down to 1792, that you <HI>never was whipt for &s;tealing!</HI> and calls upon your readers to recollect that the Aurora has &s;aid <HI>you wast.</HI> Had you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the lea&s;t knowledge or penetration, you would have known, that to deny an a&s;&s;ertion will not prove the negative, and that man is prone to believe an a&s;&s;ertion the truth of which is barely denied. Not one rogue in a hundred but pleads not guilty, yet his &s;aying he is not guilty never ac|quits him. Your readers will undoubtedly ar|gue thus, that they know B. F. Bache, who is a re&s;pectable citizen, and who has publi&s;hed that Peter Porcupine <HI>was fogged for &s;tealing</HI>&mdash; that William Cobbet, a man of a very doubt|ful character, who fled from England to France, and there took &s;hipping for America, although he could have got it more convenient and much cheaper in his native country, and who &s;ays he is Peter Porcupine, has denied it&mdash;now, which of the two are we to believe, the runnaway &s;er|jeant-major, whom nobody knows, or Mr. Bache, whom we well know&mdash;undoubtedly the latter. But you, Peter, are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more
<PB N="42" REF="030553_0043_0FE7C9F9A77A00B8">inconte&s;tible proofs than Mr. Bache can be, if you have been flogged, your back will bear witne&s;s again&s;t you, if not, again&s;t Mr. Bache. I would, therefore, recommend to you, for your character's &s;ake, to make public exhibition of your naked back, for two market days, on the balcony at the Old Court-hou&s;e; after which no one can doubt, as you will give every one an opportunity to have occular demon&s;tration of the truth or fal&s;ity of Mr. Bache's a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>But, having returned to Old England after &s;even year's ab&s;ence, and having left the army, &s;uch a dutiful child as you were, who has re|pented your fir&s;t di&s;obedience from that mo|ment to this, ought to have gone to &s;ee your aged parents or your beloved brothers; but you had forgot them at that time I &s;uppo&s;e&mdash; had your 8 year's &s;ervice in the army really be|reft you of every filial feeling. What you &s;aid re&s;pecting your brothers, I &s;uppo&s;ed all along was fal&s;e, and that you only in&s;erted it for the purpo&s;e of making your family <HI>appear</HI> a little more re&s;pectable, therefore I am not &s;urprized at their being no mention of them on your re|turn. However, being now from the army, where it would be impo&s;&s;ible to ama&s;s a &s;ingle farthing, I would like to know how you was able to procure a change from your regimentals, or to obtain a livelihood&mdash;the&s;e principal things you have omitted&mdash;&s;hould you ever have oc|ca&s;ion to print a &s;econd edition of your life and adventures, but I am much afraid you never
<PB N="43" REF="030553_0044_0FE7C9FBC5A7F7B0">will, do, for your own credit, pay a little at|tention to the&s;e remarks.</P>
<P>To free you from the imputations of <HI>garret-&s;cribbling</HI> and <HI>night-work,</HI> you appeal to the la|dies if you had time, for in the cour&s;e of the&s;e three months you got married; &s;ure that would not &s;top you, I have heard often of &s;oldiers procuring wives in one night's time.</P>
<P>After living three months in England on <HI>nothing,</HI> or rather procuring &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for your&s;elf and family during that time in an <HI>un|known manner,</HI> (for you have not a&s;&s;urance to &s;ay you either &s;aved money in the army, or married a lady of forturne,) you went to France, and continued ther upwards of &s;ix months more without doing any thing, which you have <HI>thought proper to publi&s;h</HI>&mdash;pray, did the amia|ble <HI>&s;he-porcupine</HI> accompany you?</P>
<P>You &s;ay that <HI>excepting</HI> tho&s;e who were al|ready bla&s;ted with the principles of the <HI>ac|cur&s;ed revolution,</HI> you found the people in in France hone&s;t, pious, and kind to exce&s;s; but how can you reconcile this with what almo&s;t immediately follows, where you &s;ay that your coming to this country was in con&s;equence of your having imbibed principles of republi|cani&s;m, and an ambition to become a citizen of the&s;e free &s;tates&mdash;You had imbibed notions of republicani&s;m &s;o early as 1791, yet you called the revolution in France <HI>accur&s;ed,</HI> which at that period, had no other object in view, than &s;ecuring to the people all the liberty that
<PB N="44" REF="030553_0045_0FE7CA00EDC4D7B8">can be expected under a <HI>limited</HI> monarch. At the period you was in France, and could ob|&s;eve the change that had took place among the people, in con&s;equence of their attach|ment to the principles of the <HI>accur&s;ea</HI> revolu|tion, the per&s;on of the <HI>purjured</HI> Louis was held more &s;acred, than that of your beloved &s;ove-George is at pre&s;ent by your beloved country-men&mdash;You left England to come to America becau&s;e the people here enjoyed more liberty than tho&s;e in Old England, and yet, &s;ince you have been here, tho&s;e who&s;e wi&s;dom and cou|rage procured that liberty to America, and tho&s;e who have attempted to perpetuate it, have been the con&s;tant objects of your malice and your railery, while the &s;ame men and &s;ame government, who&s;e every effort was u&s;ed to prevent the independence of the&s;e &s;tates have been the &s;ubjects of your admiration. Thus we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e either that you lied when you &s;aid you had imbibed principles of republicani&s;m, or that you do not write from principle but for guineas: What, had the Scare-Crow frightened you? Did you expect that a de&s;erved puni&s;hment was likely to fall on your <HI>guillotine worthy</HI> head, that you hurried out a pamphlet to &s;top the axe, by publi&s;hing abroad that "you had imbibed principled of republicani&s;m."</P>
<P>Again you &s;ay, your determination to &s;ettle in the United States was formed before you left the army, and as you left the army imme|diately

Can I call it an over&s;ight? No, for you have been very careful to mention things which were not of &s;uch moment; I mu&s;t there|fore &s;uppo&s;e that the account at the beginning of your life was fal&s;e, and that you know not where you was brought up.</P>
<P>You le&s;t England becau&s;e you <HI>heard</HI> the king was dethroned&mdash;a tyrant who had been guilty of &s;pilling the blood of thou&s;ands, and who had broke the mo&s;t &s;olemn engagements; this is unacountable in one who, before that had imbibed the principles of republicani&s;m, but tis more unaccountable to hear you who fied from your native country becau&s;e it was not &s;o free as this&mdash;who fled from under the protection of the "<HI>be&s;t of governments,</HI>" from the <HI>limited government</HI> of that &s;overeign <HI>madman</HI> who&s;e mental "abilities would not fit him for
<PB N="46" REF="030553_0047_0FE7CA08EF45DA38">the office of pari&s;h con&s;lable," becau&s;e you was ambitious of becoming a citizen of this republic, telling that another nation never can be happy but under an ab&s;olute monarchical government.</P>
<P>Before I leave you, I would ju&s;t wi&s;h to in|quire what you did in France, Holland, &amp;c. for &s;o long a time, and why you did not go to England to take &s;hipping, when you deter|mined to leave Europe. Your native country was &s;o near, the pa&s;&s;age &s;o much cheaper, ve|&s;&s;els for America always &s;ailing from its various ports, and to have the plea&s;ure of &s;pending a few days among&s;t ones country men and friends, would be objects of the fir&s;t magnitude with any one who <HI>dur&s;t</HI> be &s;een in their native land. I therefore am of opinion, that your leaving England <HI>was not a matter of chuce!</HI> but to prevent an interview with certain Bow-&s;treet runners&mdash;to return would con&s;equently be imprudent.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, by your own account, you knew knothing of your ance&s;tors prior to your grand|father, who was a day-labonrer, and died as poor as he lived&mdash;your father was <HI>a very learned man,</HI> and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an exten&s;ive farm, yet you run off from him to &s;erve your king&mdash;one of your brothers was a merchant, and one a &s;ol|dier in the Ea&s;t India Company's &s;ervice!&mdash; another a farmer, and you a &s;oldier in the Bri|ti&s;h army! from whence you was di&s;charged on account of <HI>your &s;ervices</HI> and <HI>good behaviour!</HI>
