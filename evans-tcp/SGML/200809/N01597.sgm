<P>A Man who&s;e Name was JEREMIAH FENWICK, was upon a Fair Trial brought in GUILTY of having Murdered his Neighbour with an <HI>Axe,</HI> which he took up, and Employed a Repeted Blow thereof, at a Per&s;on at whom his Anger was Enraged.</P>

You are doubtle&s;s willing to know the Name of the <HI>Murderer</HI> upon whom I have this De&s;ign. I inform you then, UNGOVERNED ANGER, I &s;ay, UNGOVERNED ANGER is the Malefactor.

Let it have a due Attention from us: Let all <HI>I&s;rael Hear and Fear,</HI> and let that <HI>Fooli&s;h Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> be no more indulged among us.</P>
<P>If I &s;hould &s;ay, That the <HI>Sacri|fice</HI> of the lea&s;t Good Thing in the World, unto UNGOVERNED ANGER, is the <HI>Sacrifice of a Fool,</HI> I have read unto you a Text from whence the A&s;&s;ertion would be Ju&s;tified.</P>
<P>My Text is found in a Book, which contains the Wi&s;e and Ju&s;t Sentiments of a <HI>Soul</HI> upon the Strokes of <HI>Recollection:</HI> A Soul <HI>Repenting</HI> of the <HI>Follies</HI> Commit|ted

<HEAD>&V;NGOVERNED ANGER is a ve|ry Fooli&s;h Thing; has very much Folly in it.</HEAD>

There was a Caution once given; Judg. XVIII. 25. <HI>Let not thy Voice be heard among us, le&s;t Angry Folks run upon thee.</HI> But I don't u&s;e to be afraid of the <HI>Fools.</HI> It is now E&s;pecially to <HI>Angry Folks,</HI> that my <HI>Voice</HI> is to be directed. But the whole Auditory is deeply con|cern'd. Let every Per&s;on in it, be <HI>flow to wrath, and receive with Meek|ne&s;s, the Word,</HI> which, Oh! how well would it be for us, if it might be <HI>Engrafted into our Souls!</HI></P>
<P N="1">I.

<P>The <HI>meekne&s;s</HI> to be de&s;ired is, that whereof we read; Gal. V. 22,
<PB N="10" REF="001898_0010_0FB9D3A8B8D1CAA8">23, <HI>The Fruit of the Spirit, is meek|ne&s;s.</HI> And it being a <HI>Grace</HI> which is a <HI>Fruit</HI> of the Holy <HI>Spirit,</HI> it is peculiar to them, whom the Holy <HI>Spirit</HI> has Renewed and Quickened; and who have begun to <HI>live unto GOD.</HI> It is the <HI>meekne&s;s,</HI> which is <HI>put on</HI> by the <HI>Elect of GOD,</HI> who are become <HI>Holy and Beloved.</HI> My Friend, Until a Principle of PIETY have animated thy Soul, it will be a Stranger to the True, Right, Genuine <HI>Meekne&s;s;</HI> UNGOVER|NED ANGER will be one of thy unhealed Maladies.</P>
<P>There is a <HI>Meekne&s;s</HI> of <HI>Complexi|on,</HI> wherewith &s;ome are advantaged. They are of a more &s;tayed, a more &s;ettled, a more compo&s;ed Humour than other Men; and &s;o <HI>Phlegmatick</HI> is their <HI>Complexion,</HI> that they be not &s;oon Enraged.

Rational Con|templations of pure <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> have mightily compo&s;ed their Souls; and the Le&s;&s;ons of <HI>Morality</HI> have
<PB N="11" REF="001898_0011_0FB9D3B0E6A737C8">&s;weetly tempered them. Yea, But the <HI>Meekne&s;s</HI> after which we are to a&s;pire, &s;hould be of an Higher elevation in Chri&s;tianity; It &s;hould be nothing &s;hort of that; Jam. III. 17. <HI>The Wi&s;dom that is from above, which is Peaceable, Gentle, Ea&s;y to be Entreated.</HI></P>
<P>I will give one Remarable Dif|ference, between the <HI>Meekne&s;s</HI> of meer <HI>Nature;</HI> and that more <HI>Spi|ritual Meekne&s;s</HI> which a Mind Rec|tified by the Holy <HI>Spirit</HI> of GOD arrives unto. The <HI>Meekne&s;s</HI> of meer <HI>Nature</HI> is equally In&s;en&s;ible under all &s;orts of <HI>Provocations.</HI> But the <HI>Meekne&s;s</HI> of a <HI>Sanctified Mind</HI> is not &s;o. In the former <HI>Meekne&s;s</HI> Men are as unconcerned about A|bu&s;es offered unto GOD, as they are about Abu&s;es offered unto <HI>them|&s;elves.</HI> But in the latter <HI>Meekne&s;s</HI> it is not &s;o. We are to be Ea&s;y, when Abu&s;es are offered unto <HI>our &s;elves.</HI> And this from a Principle of <HI>Obedience</HI> and <HI>Submi&s;&s;ion</HI> unto GOD. At the &s;ame Time, when
<PB N="12" REF="001898_0012_0FB9D3B1C32E50D8">Abu&s;es are offered unto our glori|ous GOD, Now a Certain Com|motion of <HI>Zeal</HI> &s;hould-be rai&s;ed in us. <HI>Now</HI> we &s;hould be <HI>Zealous,</HI> be Troubled, be grieved. <HI>Now</HI> with an Holy <HI>Anger</HI> we &s;hould let it be &s;een, <HI>Things are not, as we &s;hould have them to be!</HI> A <HI>Meek</HI> Man &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>In aliis Man&s;uetus ero; at in Injuriis contra Chri&s;tum non ita.</HI> No <HI>Injuries</HI> but what are offered unto GOD, &s;hall make any Impre&s;&s;ions on my <HI>Man&s;uetude.</HI></P>
<P>Briefly. 'Tis prae&s;cribed, Eph. IV. 26. <HI>Be Angry, but do not Sin.</HI> The Rule for this would be, <HI>Be Angry at nothing but Sin.</HI> I humbly con|ceive, That this may be fairly main|tained, as the <HI>Golden Rule</HI> of <HI>Meck|ne&s;s.</HI> If you would not <HI>Sin</HI> in your <HI>Anger,</HI> let nothing but <HI>Sin</HI> be the Object of your <HI>Anger.</HI> If <HI>Anger</HI> begin to boil, Examine, <HI>Is there any Sin against GOD committed, in what I am going to be Angry at?</HI> If there be None, it will be <HI>Meekne&s;s of Wi&s;dom</HI> to throw away no <HI>Anger</HI>

<P>Fir&s;t. We are to make our <HI>Sup|plications</HI> and <HI>Re&s;ignations,</HI> unto the Holy SPIRIT of GOD our SA|VIOUR; to obtain the Grace of <HI>Meekne&s;s</HI> from Him. It was En|joyned of old, <HI>Seek ye the Lord, All ye Meek of the Earth.</HI> 'Tis now to be the Injunction laid upon us all, <HI>Seek ye the Lord, That ye may be made the Meek of the Earth</HI> Yea, <HI>Seek Meekne&s;s,</HI> is the Thing Ex|pre&s;ly directed to. When <HI>Meek|ne&s;s</HI> is called for, there is that Di|rection given for the obtaining of it; Jam. 1.5. <HI>If any of you lack Wi&s;|dom, let him ask of GOD, and it &s;hall be given him;</HI>&mdash;The <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> to &s;teer clear of UNGOVERNED ANGER, with a <HI>Spirit of Meekne&s;s.</HI> My <HI>Angry</HI> Brother, Carry that <HI>Fro|ward Heart</HI> of thine unto the Ho|ly SPIRIT of GOD thy SAVIOUR, and plead, <HI>O my GOD, I have the Heart of a fierce Tyger in me, but thou can&s;t change my Heart, and make
<PB N="14" REF="001898_0014_0FB9D3B7CAF71160">me as meek as a Lamb.

<P>Secondly. Having &s;o <HI>&s;ought Meek|ne&s;s,</HI> let us now proceed unto the <HI>Exerci&s;es</HI> of it.</P>
<P>You are aware; That <HI>Meekne&s;s</HI> does not propo&s;e to <HI>De&s;troy</HI> our
<PB N="15" REF="001898_0015_0FB9D3B94F55BC48"><HI>Anger,</HI> but only to Govern it.

Goodne&s;s</HI> it &s;elf may have <HI>Anger</HI> in it; <HI>Meekne&s;s</HI> it &s;elf may be <HI>Angry.</HI> But then, Fir&s;t; <HI>Meekne&s;s</HI> mu&s;t <HI>Govern</HI> our <HI>Anger,</HI> as to the Rea&s;ons of it. You mu&s;t be <HI>well-advi&s;ed</HI> by <HI>Meekne&s;s,</HI> a|gain&s;t that <HI>Weakne&s;s,</HI> of being, <HI>An|gry without a Cau&s;e;</HI> Le&s;t you be <HI>plea&s;ed</HI> no otherwi&s;e than,&mdash;you know how!

When the words of GOD in <HI>Sound Doctrines,</HI> or in <HI>Just Reproofs</HI> are brought un|to us, 'tis a Wicked Thing to be <HI>Angry</HI> at them.

Hu&s;h; Do not &s;ay, Thou Do&s;t! But then, I will go on with my Limitations, Take the&s;e Two; Be not <HI>Angry for No|thing;</HI> and, Be not <HI>Angry for Every Thing.</HI> Both of the&s;e are Exor|bitances. Your <HI>Anger</HI> &s;hould not be <HI>for Nothing.</HI> If you are <HI>Angry</HI> you &s;hould be Able to give a &s;uf|ficient, and a &s;ignificant Account, <HI>why you are &s;o!</HI> Not fret and fume for you know not what your &s;elves: Nor upon a meer mi&s;take, a meer Fancy, and ungrounded &s;u&s;picion; &s;ome wrong Information. Over all your <HI>Anger,</HI> and all that you do or &s;peak in your <HI>Anger</HI> be able to &s;ay with him; I Sam. XVII. 29. <HI>Is there not a Cau&s;e?</HI> Nor &s;hould

<P>Secondly. <HI>Meekne&s;s</HI> mu&s;t <HI>Govern</HI> our <HI>Anger</HI> as to the <HI>Sea&s;ons</HI> of it. If you are <HI>Angry out of Time,</HI> Ve|rily, your Spirit is out of <HI>Tune.</HI> You make wretched <HI>Jars,</HI> if you don't <HI>keep Time</HI> in your <HI>Anger.</HI> There are Two Cautions to be ten|dred you.</P>
<P>One Caution is this; You mu&s;t not be <HI>Angry</HI> too <HI>Soon.</HI> What a Reprimand have our &s;hort-winded, ha&s;ty, huffy People, given to them! In Prov. XIV. 17. <HI>He that is &s;oon Angry, dealeth fooli&s;hly.</HI> Syrs, My

<P>I Con&s;ider my &s;elf as a dying, Man, and I de&s;ire to dye giving Glory to God, before whom I am now to make my Appearance. I offer up my Prai&s;es unto God who has granted me &s;uch a &s;pace of Repentance, and &s;o many helps and means to bring me to it</P>

<P>To all the other Sins of a Wicked Life, I have added this; That I have too much delayed my Repentance, even &s;ince my Impri&s;onment, while the Sentence again&s;t my evil work, was not yet certain to be Executed. Though I have hereby &s;o affronted and provoked the good Spirit of Grace, that He might ju&s;tly with|draw for ever from me, yet &s;uch has been his Free and Rich Grace, as to continue &s;till to vi&s;it me with his In|fluences; and bring on a work of Repentance in my Soul.</P>
<P>I heartily mourn for all the Sins of my Life; and above all for the Fountain of all Sins, which I have in an Heart that is de&s;perately wick|ed. I mo&s;t particularly confe&s;s and bewail my Blood Guiltine&s;s. I owe my Life to Ju&s;tice, for having wrong|fully taken away the Life of my Bro|ther, whom I ought to have loved as my &s;elf. I own the Ju&s;tice of the Government in their Proceeding a|gain&s;t me. <HI>But, Lord, there is For|givene&s;s with thee, that thou maye&s;t be feared.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="001898_0052_0FB9D429CCFF4158">
I behold the Infinite Mercy of a God ready to Pardon; and my Soul is amazed at it. I behold a great Saviour, &s;hedding his Blood, which clean&s;es from all Sin. And I hear him &s;aying to the chief of Sinners, <HI>Him that cometh unto me I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out.</HI> With a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Soul I fly to him, to be reconciled unto God, and to be led into Paths of Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s. I am not without Hope. And one fruit of my Hope, is, that it cau&s;es me to look on my Sins with more Sorrow for them, and Hatred of them; which till I had this Hope, I did not care or dare to think upon. Another fruit of it, is, that my Heart is melted, and filled with De&s;ires to Glorify God.</P>
<P>And I know not how to glorify God more, than by &s;olemn warnings unto all People to take heed of &s;uch Sins, as have brought me to &s;uch a Ruin as is now come upon me.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that lies heavy on my Heart is, My Prophanation of the Lords Day, and my frequently &amp; needle&s;ly neglecting the Publick Wor|&s;hip of God. A Sin, which let all that love their Souls be afraid of.
