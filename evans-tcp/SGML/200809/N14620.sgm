<P>THE next &s;tep of a Nation towards the happine&s;s of its individuals, after having &s;truggled for, and glo|riou&s;ly obtained, its freedom, is to e&s;tabli&s;h Ju&s;tice, which is generally ob&s;tructed by party and lawle&s;s men, to gratify their private views during &s;uch conte&s;t. It is not &s;ufficient in this country to e&s;tabli&s;h ju&s;tice for the American-born &s;ons only, it mu&s;t be al&s;o impartial for, or again&s;t, any naturalized men in the United States. Patrioti&s;m does not con&s;i&s;t in oppre&s;&s;ing the dutiful emigrants to indulge the avidity of the rapacious countrymen, but to &s;upport either, when in|jured at home or abroad, by unju&s;t powers.</P>
<P>I &s;ubmit, with all po&s;&s;ible humility, this Memorial to the judgment of the candid Reader; but I &s;tand in the greate&s;t need of his indulgence, being under the di&s;advan|tages of not knowing thoroughly the language; obliged to &s;peak of my&s;elf, which always appears &s;elfi&s;h; compelled to detect a number of artful men and parties, which may be &s;u&s;pected from me as a&s;per&s;ions again&s;t my enemies: All the&s;e con&s;iderations would have kept me a &s;ilent victim, was it not my duty to do my utmo&s;t to &s;hew the inju&s;tice done to me, in order to warn others, if po&s;&s;ible, in &s;imilar circum&s;tances; and al&s;o the legi&s;lative power, that they may be enabled to prevent the &s;ame: being confident that the proofs thereof, I am about to give, are &s;o obvious that every body who will read this Memorial, will be convinced that I was in fact &s;acrificed.</P>

<HEAD>MEMORIAL, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I Was born at St. Malo, city of France, and was admitted in the King's &s;ea-&s;ervice of that country in the capacity of Lieutenant of a Frigate, in the beginning of the year 1763, and had the misfortune to be dangerou&s;ly wounded in an engagement &s;ix months after During the peace, which was concluded then, I was almo&s;t all the time employed at &s;ea in the &s;ame &s;tation, and made the voyage round the world on board the Etoile (the Star) under the orders of Mr. de Bougainville. During the Mini&s;try of Mr. de Boyneis, I was promoted to the rank of Captain de Brulot (Fire-&s;hip) in the year 1773; and a month after was appointed Captain of the line of battle-&s;hip the Flamand; which preferment rou&s;ed the jealou&s;y of the officers of &s;imilar rank in that &s;ervice again&s;t me to &s;uch a degree that it never &s;ub&s;ided &s;ince. When Mr. de Sartine &s;ucceeded to that Mini&s;try, all the officers who had been mo&s;t inveterate again&s;t his predece&s;&s;or, &s;urrounded him, took the advantage over the others, and forgot nothing to annoy tho&s;e who had obtained any of the King's favour during the preceeding Mini&s;try: in con&s;equence thereof, the Cro&s;s of St. Louis, which I had the promi&s;e to be knighted immedi|ately with, was refu&s;ed me after by Mr. de Sartine, and he ordered me to go to Bre&s;t; where, being arrived, I received the commi&s;&s;ion of Lieutenant of that harbour. Soon after, an ordi|nance from the King was i&s;&s;ued, by which the officers of the harbour were no longer to be pro|moted in their rank with the other officers in the navy; whereupon I wrote and repre&s;ented to the Mini&s;ter, that I was not in that line of &s;ervice I had been in hitherto, and wherein I had merited and obtained the King's favour, and begged to be re&s;tored to it; and to the contrary, I occupied one I was ignorant of, and of cour&s;e u&s;ele&s;s in it: he &s;ent in an&s;wer my di&s;charge to General D'orvilliers, wherein was expre&s;&s;ed the King's &s;atisfaction for the &s;ervice I had ren|dered in the &s;everal offices I had occupied; but there was no pen&s;ion as u&s;ual, nor the Cro&s;s of St. Louis, was added to it. Mr. de Sartine &s;ent it thus, thinking I would never leave the &s;er|vice, or accept my di&s;charge, without having obtained fir&s;t tho&s;e things. General D'orvilliers &s;aid and did all he could to make me &s;tay in the &s;ervice; but I in&s;i&s;ted &s;o effectually, that after three days, he delivered to me my di&s;charge, and I went to Paris.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year 1777, I imparted a plan to D. Franklin, which he approved of much; but Mr. de Sartine, having been told of it, forbid to put it in execution. I acquainted Dr. Franklin with this di&s;appointment; he told me he had taken &s;ome informations about me which were to my advantage, and my &s;ervices would be agreeable to America; in con&s;equence thereof, that Mr. Deane was going to fit out two &s;hips loaded with very nece&s;&s;ary &s;tores for America, and I could not recommend my&s;elf better to Congre&s;s than by carrying one of them, and to &s;peak to Mr. Deane, who was in the next room: accordingly I went, but he informed me that expedition could not take place yet, that he would let me know when it &s;hould be time.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="018549_0004_0FA7AD65024F9550">In April we agreed verbally, Mr. Deane and I, that the &s;um of twelve thou&s;and livres tour|nois, on my arrival in America, with the &s;hip and cargo, would be paid to me as a gratuity; and the commi&s;&s;ion of Captain of man-of-war in the American navy would be delivered to me with my in&s;tructions, how to carry on &s;aid expedition. But having heard that &s;everal officers &s;ent in America by Mr. Deane, had not been employed when arrived, I told him I wi&s;hed to &s;ee Dr. Franklin (who was removed to Pa&s;&s;y) give his a&s;&s;ent to our tran&s;action, which he did on the fir&s;t of May, and Dr. Franklin wi&s;hed me a happy pa&s;&s;age, and &s;aid he expected to hear that on my arrival in America, I had obtained the command of one of the 74 gun &s;hips, which would be launched by that time: and Mr. Deane a&s;&s;ured me he would write by all opportuni|ties to acquaint Congre&s;s with our tran&s;actions, and that I &s;hould find every thing in America as I wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>The &s;ame afternoon I &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t off for Mar&s;eilles, where the &s;hip was: being arrived there, with the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ecrecy and great difficulties, I had her loaded with bra&s;s guns and mortars, bomb|&s;hells, &s;hots, powder, brim&s;tone and mu&s;kets; but was detained there five months by contra orders from Mr. Deane: during which time I was &s;ent for by Mr. Bertin, the General Com|mi&s;&s;ary for the navy, who told me he had received orders from Mr. de Sartine to make a &s;ecret expedition, and to offer me the command of it; and if I accepted it, I might depend upon ob|taining all the reward I could expect for my former &s;ervice. I an&s;wered I was very &s;orry I could not accept and accompli&s;h the Mini&s;ter's order, as I had the command of a &s;hip in the harbour confided to my care, which I could not leave: he replied, that he would prevent my &s;ailing in her, and ordered me to unload her: I told him I had no money to do it; but I would write to Paris for &s;ome; and accordingly I wrote to Mr. Deane, and at la&s;t all difficul|ties were over.</P>
<P>I &s;ailed on the 29th September from Mar&s;eilles, with a crew compo&s;ed of all &s;orts of men of different nations, having on board as pa&s;&s;engers, General Stuben, two of his Aids-de-camp, and Mr. de Francy. We went pretty &s;lowly and quietly as far as Bermuda: but when the crew perceived the &s;hip &s;teered northerly, they began one day to grumble from breakfa&s;t time until after dinner, when a great many of them gathered together on the fore-ca&s;tle, where they were very &s;aucy, and &s;aid they would not go to North-America; having ob&s;erved there were three ring-leaders among them, and that it was indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to &s;top the mutiny by open force, &s;ince they would not yield to rea&s;on, I ordered the Gunner to have &s;ome mu&s;kets ready loaded, and to hand me a couple of hangers, of which I gave one to the Fir&s;t-Lieutenant, and told him to follow me on the fore-ca&s;tle, having left General Stuben, with his own &s;word in hand, on the quarter-deck, to prevent the mutineers from getting ma&s;ters there, I went di|rectly with my hanger up to the thicke&s;t of the mutineers, di&s;per&s;ed the three ring-leaders: &s;eeing they were abandoned by the re&s;t, they got up in the fore-ma&s;t &s;hrowds; but &s;eeing I had called for loaded mu&s;kets, which were brought to me, they all three &s;urrendered them&s;elves. I had them put in irons, and without any further puni&s;hment, all were quieted. We met with very heavy and &s;qually gales of north-we&s;t winds, and rough &s;eas, for a long time, but at la&s;t got into Port&s;mouth River, in Hamp&s;hire, on the 2d December 1777; the place of my de&s;tination, where I delivered, as per orders, the &s;hip and cargo to Mr. de Francy.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as arrived I wrote to, and acquainted, the Honourable Congre&s;s with the important cargo I had brought in the &s;hip, and how I came upon promi&s;e and expectation of having &s;oon a command, being commi&s;&s;ioned Captain in the American navy, and had al&s;o the promi&s;e of being paid, as &s;oon as arrived, the &s;um of twelve thou&s;and livres tournois gratuity, for bring|ing her there, but received no an&s;wer to that letter, nor tho&s;e I wrote after from Bo&s;ton, where

I &s;pent the winter, which determined me to go to York-Town. Being arrived there, in the latter end of April, 1778, I applied to the Marine Committee, and exhibitted my commi&s;&s;ion and corre&s;pondence with Silas Deane, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> which contained his promi&s;e, that I &s;hould be pro|moted and well rewarded; but no &s;um was &s;tipulated, and they &s;aid they had received no in|telligence thereof, although he had told me he would &s;end; however, having made their re|port, it was re&s;olved,

</LETTER>
<P>Having already heard of the undutifulne&s;s of &s;ome of the officers in the navy, I reque&s;ted a letter to recommend the Navy-Board at Bo&s;ton to appoint &s;uch ones as they thought would obey my orders, which was given me, and I tran&s;mitted to the Hon. James Warren, E&s;q, Pre|&s;ident thereof, as &s;oon as arrived there; but he told me the two Fir&s;t-Lieutenants were already appointed and on board the Frigate Alliance at Sal&s;bury, where &s;he was built. I enquired about them, and was told they were the mo&s;t litigious in the &s;ervice, and had already participa|ted to have one of the able&s;t Captains in the &s;ervice broke.</P>
<P>I went to Sal&s;bury and took the command of the Frigate Alliance, but the two Lieutenants received me with vi&s;ible reluctance, which was confirmed by their conver&s;ation; however, I over-looked it, thinking good u&s;age would over-come their prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t me: they &s;oon
<PB N="6" REF="018549_0006_0FA7AD6635937440">
finding that they could expect no rea&s;ons to alledge again&s;t my dutifulne&s;s and activity, began to try to draw me in their &s;nares; they feigned to have an irreconcilable quarrel together, and came both to me, one after the other, to tell me they could never, for the future, agree, and reque&s;ted I would di&s;charge one of the two: I told them it was forbid me, by the regula|tion of the navy; that we would &s;oon be in Bo&s;ton, where they might make their reque&s;t on that account, to the Navy-Board there; but if they could not &s;tay till then, they might write and &s;tate their affair to &s;aid Navy-Board, and wait for their an&s;wer; when they &s;aw I had pene|trated into their &s;cheme, they never &s;aid a word more about it.</P>
<P>When we were come down with the Frigate before Newbury town, the fir&s;t Lieutenant came to a&s;k my leave to go to Bo&s;ton; I told him I could not grant it, as there were but two Lieu|tenants, and the &s;hip being in a narrow bed of the river, where &s;he mu&s;t be kept afloat, by &s;laking or heaving every change of tide upon the cables according to the wind, otherwi&s;e &s;he would be aground: he replied, he did not care whether &s;he went aground, nor for my leave to go to Bo&s;ton, he would go, and accordingly went. I wrote the &s;ame day to the Navy-Board, ac|quainting them that the Fir&s;t-Lieutenant had applied to me for leave to go to Bo&s;ton, but I had refu&s;ed his reque&s;t, as the &s;hip required his attendance then more than ever; and as he in&s;i&s;ted upon going there, if they chu&s;ed, he &s;hould go to &s;end him their leave, without mentioning that he was already gone again&s;t my will, knowing they mu&s;t know it by &s;eeing him there; and it happened, he was in the Navy-Board when they received my letter, by which they could p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ainly &s;ee the di&s;obedience of that officer; neverthele&s;s, they wrote to me two days after, in an open letter by him, that I could give leave of ab&s;ence to the officers whenever I &s;hould think proper; by which I &s;aw that, in&s;tead of puni&s;hing the &s;aid Lieutenant for leaving the &s;hip and his duty, again&s;t my con&s;ent, they &s;upported him, and gave me a charge which would bring new trouble upon me, as it would di&s;atisfy the officers, when, by the &s;ervice, I &s;hould be com|pelled to refu&s;e them leave of ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>We brought the Frigate Alliance to Bo&s;ton in the beginning of Augu&s;t, where the Lieute|nants undutifulne&s;s increa&s;ed daily; they &s;eldom remained on board in the night, and rarely any one was on deck in the day time, and did all they could to oppo&s;e my orders and &s;ubvert the &s;ervice. The Fir&s;t-Lieutenant one day came at the head of the &s;ea-men, among&s;t which were a great many Engli&s;hmen, to reque&s;t of me, that, in&s;tead of having their allowance given to them as u&s;ual, in grog, I would order the &s;hip's Steward to give it to them in rum: I told him it could not be done, by the danger that, after having drank their rum, they mu&s;t drink water to quench their thir&s;t, which would make them &s;ick with cholic, loo&s;ene&s;s and &s;lux; but he in|&s;i&s;ted, with the &s;ea-men, upon it, &s;aying it was cold weather then. I cau&s;ed my Clerk to read on the quarter-deck, an article which forbids it, from the Engli&s;h regulations of the navy, which I was directed to follow; neverthele&s;s, when I was abroad, the officers ordered the Stew|ard to give raw rum to the people; and did &s;uch things to coax the people, and to alienate them from me. It was given out in town, that I u&s;ed the &s;ea-men on board very ill, on pur|po&s;e to prevent others to enli&s;t.</P>
<P>The Navy-Board ordered me to prepare and di&s;po&s;e, with all po&s;&s;ible &s;ecret, the Frigate to receive the Marquis de la Fayette and his &s;uit, con&s;i&s;ting of nine gentlemen and their &s;er|vants, on board in order to carry them to France: as the bread-room had been made before I took the command, by the direction of the fir&s;t Lieutenant, of double the room requi&s;ite to put the nece&s;&s;ary bread, I ordered to take three feet and half on each &s;ide of it to make a gallery round it, as there was all round the &s;hips in&s;ide, for in an engagement to have it clear, that the Carpenter might ea&s;ily plug any &s;hot holes under water; be&s;ides that advantage, and keeping
<PB N="7" REF="018549_0007_0FA7AD672BE2CD60">
the bread drier, it procured room where to put in &s;ix beds for the pa&s;&s;engers: and in order to have the bread &s;teady in the bread-room, upon the different tacks and motions of the &s;hip, pre&s;erved better, and have &s;ufficient room, I ordered the Fir&s;t-Lieutenant, when I was going on &s;hore, to have all the bi&s;cuits &s;towed one by one, by which means it would take only the two-thirds of the &s;ame room it would by being promi&s;cuou&s;ly thrown in: but in&s;tead of having my order ful|filled, he had two men to empty the bags of bread in the bread-room, as fa&s;t as they could. When I came back on board, I found them employed at that work, in his pre&s;ence: I told him it was very &s;trange, that though I charg'd him po&s;itively to have one thing done one way, he always had it done in the contrary: he replied, that it was none of his bu&s;ine&s;s to have the bread &s;towed: I told him it was his bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;mit the orders I gave him when I went on &s;hore, that they might be executed: he &s;aid he had never heard before of &s;towing the bread, and I might order &s;ome body el&s;e to have it done, as he could not order it. He told me that they wanted to have a &s;tove in the ward-room: I replied, it was always warm enough there without one; he &s;aid no more, but all the three Lieutenants of the &s;hip (as there was a third one come) and the Captain and Lieutenant of marines, all together left the &s;hip.</P>
<P>I went to the Navy Board; Mr. Warren was upon his Farm at Plimouth, Mr. Di&s;chaus at New-London, to fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> out the frigate Confederacy, and there was no body but Mr. Vernon, I told him all the officers undutifulne&s;s, and how it was impo&s;&s;ible to have the &s;ervice done with them, and that they had left the &s;hip; he told me I might depend upon having a new &s;et of officers before I &s;hould &s;ail, but as there were none in Bo&s;ton to receive them on board until they could be replaced, and they returned after four days ab&s;ence: the Captain of the Marines told me, he and all the other officers had agreed together, that, if ever I put any one under an arre&s;t there, every one would go. I acquainted again the Navy-Board with the officers re&s;olution, which would take out of my power, all manner of corrections and con&s;equently of amendment. Mr. Vernon repeated his promi&s;es, &s;aying tho&s;e officers &s;hould not go in the &s;hip.</P>
<P>Capt. Barry told me, with an air of confidence, that my officers, with all the Captains, had wrote a petition to the Admiralty or Congre&s;s (I dont remember which) again&s;t my command|ing the Alliance, though they had no other rea&s;on to give again&s;t me but that I was a French|man; and he added, that he would not &s;ign it, as Congre&s;s knew what they were about when they re&s;olved giving me &s;aid command; which la&s;t part was fal&s;e, as he &s;igned it one of the fir&s;t as will appear hereafter.</P>
<P>The Frigate Alliance being almo&s;t ready, I wrote to the Marine Committee in Philadel|phia, where they had removed with Congre&s;s, that Silas Deane, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> having been there &s;ome time, they had opportunity, according to their de&s;ire, to enquire of him about our tran&s;action between he and I, a&s;&s;ented to by Dr. Franklin, about the twelve thou&s;and livres gratuity pro|mi&s;ed to be paid on my arrival in America, for bringing the &s;hip Flaman, as I had done; and as I doubted not he would confirm my right claim on that account, I begged that Congre&s;s, who waited only for their report on that &s;ubject to have me paid, would order &s;aid &s;um to be paid to me whil&s;t in France, where I was ordered to go in the Alliance; I received no an&s;wer.</P>
<P>The crew of the Alliance being by great many too &s;hort, the other men-of-war at Bo&s;ton, gave twenty men to increa&s;e it, and I had be&s;ides thirty &s;ick Frenchmen left there by Ad|miral Count d' E&s;taing's &s;quadron, to enable me to carry the Frigate to France, where I was told I would find American &s;eamen enough coming from the Engli&s;h pri&s;ons to complete the crew with.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="018549_0008_0FA7AD6A6E971BD8">Before the Frigate Alliance went down to Nanta&s;ket road, I applied to the Navy-Board to have their promi&s;e of a new &s;et of officers fulfilled, as tho&s;e I had grew wor&s;e every day; but the an&s;wer was, tho&s;e I had would be better, when once out of Bo&s;ton, and that they had no others; but they wrote a letter to recommend tho&s;e officers to behave well; the Marquis de la Fayette being on board, who might take notice of any thing that might happen to the contrary.</P>
<P>The Marquis de la Fayette and the other French gentlemen being on board, and all ready, I went to the Navy-Board to take my &s;ailing orders from them, but they told me there was a report, that about eighty Engli&s;h &s;ea-men from the Sommer&s;et Engli&s;h man-of-war lo&s;t upon Cape-Cod, were on board the Frigate Alliance, where they had entered with the plot and pro&s;pect to rai&s;e again&s;t the American and Frenchmen on board, in order to get ma&s;ters of the Frigate and carry her to New-York; I went with Mr. Vernon to the goal were it &s;prung from, to hear more about it, but the man who had gave it out as a certain truth had been relea&s;ed the day before and could be found no where. The Navy-Board neverthele&s;s ordered me to &s;ail and keep good look out to prevent any &s;uch things happening. It may be remarked under what &s;ini&s;ter au&s;pices I was to proceed, having no officers that would obey me, and an appearance of &s;uch plot on board, having no twenty born Americans in the crew to help me to prevent or oppo&s;e it. I went on board, and we &s;ailed on the 14th January 1779, in com|pany with the Frigate Deane, which we parted with the 16th in&s;tant.</P>
<P>On the 20th in&s;tant, having had the three days before very various &s;trong winds and high &s;eas, by which all the riggings, which was new and frozen, when we &s;ailed out of Bo&s;ton, and had &s;tretched to &s;uch decree that only the preventers &s;tays kept the lower ma&s;ts &s;tanding up, &s;even of the main and fore-ma&s;ts &s;hrowds plate having given way, though the top-gallant-ma&s;ts and yards was &s;truck down, the main-top ma&s;t went overboard in the night, a heavy &s;ea came on board, kept the &s;hip on her beams end for about a minute, and carried away the pi|nace boat, &s;ome &s;pare ma&s;ts and yards from upon the beams, and all the crew abandoned the deck and went to hide them&s;elves between decks, were one was found &s;mothered dead. On the 24th in&s;tant, having been prevented till then by the bad weather and continual high &s;ea, we had a another main-top-ma&s;t rigged and hoi&s;ted up, after which we had all fixed as well as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t February, at 3 o'clock A. M. one of the Ma&s;ter's Mate came to acquaint me that he had heard &s;omething that night, of a con&s;piracy, to take the Frigate from us and carry her to England, by a party of the crew, but that they intended to do it only when we would be upon &s;ounding ground, as he knew but few of them, and he had heard but loo&s;e words about it, I told him to be watchful and keep him&s;elf, or another, that could under&s;tand them in Iri&s;h, always in the place where from he &s;aid he could hear all they &s;aid in the Marines birth, where they a&s;&s;embled to con&s;ult how to put their plan in execution, and to let me know as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible whatever he could hear: I told likewi&s;e the Fir&s;t Lieutenant to watch on his &s;ide and let no body know it but the Captain of Marines, that he might put no centries by the arm-che&s;ts and other important po&s;ts, but tho&s;e he could well depend upon, tho&s;e officers being very punctual in their duty, and no pre&s;ent dangers, I thought unnece&s;&s;ary to ac|quaint the Marquis de la Fayette with it, which might make him unea&s;y, until it became urgent.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Ma&s;ters Mate came the next night after to tell me further, that he had heard the plotters agree to put their plan in execution the night following at one o'clock, A. M. as there would be none out of bed but tho&s;e on watch upon deck. As &s;oon as it was day-light I went in the &s;tate-room which the Marquis de la Fayette occupied, awoke and acquainted him with the
<PB N="9" REF="018549_0009_0FA7AD6B51EF81C8">
plot going on, and begged he would tell the &s;ame to the other French gentlemen, and at the &s;ame time to keep it yet &s;ecret; and I went to give proper orders to prevent the mutineers to &s;ucceed in their attempt; I &s;ent for the Fir&s;t-Lieutenant, told him to go in the ward-room with &s;ome tru&s;ty men, to hand out of the ward-room &s;tern ports to the Cabin windows, where I would have &s;ome body to take in &s;ome &s;pears, mu&s;kets, bayonets, pi&s;tols, hangers and cartridges, which were there; that was done in a moment's time, the bayonets fixed to the mu&s;kets, which were loaded, and the pi&s;tols in &s;ufficient quantity. I did this, becau&s;e if we had taken the arms out of the arm-che&s;ts on the quarter-deck, the mutineers perceiving it, might have ru&s;hed all together, or pointed the two fore-ca&s;tle nine-pounders, which were ready loaded, and ru&s;hed upon us before one mu&s;ket would have been loaded; be&s;ides, they might have ea&s;ily &s;eized up|on two bunches of pikes which were laying in the quarter-deck netting: when we were thus prepared, we could wait for the event calmly, as the Marine officer on the quarter-deck had orders to &s;tamp with his feet on the quarter-deck, if he &s;aw any extraordinary motion, for a &s;ignal to twenty who were in the cabin, to come altogether armed upon the quarter-deck.</P>
<P>When we were &s;itting at dinner, the Ma&s;ter's Mate came in a hurry to tell me, that the plotters were a&s;&s;embled and coming whil&s;t we would be at dinner. I a&s;ked him whether he knew the ring-leaders; he told me he did. I begged of the Marquis de la Fayette, that he would tell eight of the French gentlemen to arm them&s;elves with mu&s;kets, &amp;c. and come upon the quarter-deck: the Marquis did, and headed them. I de&s;ired Col. Duplecix to head all the &s;ervants, &s;ent for the re&s;t of the French fore-ma&s;t men, and all to remain in the cabin, and look out of it, to pre|vent the mutineers from pointing the deck guns on the cabin, and to fire upon them if they of|fered to do it. I went with the Marquis de la Fayette and the eight gentlemen upon the quarter-deck, &s;howed them the two arm-che&s;ts and two bunches of pikes, which I begged the Marquis de la Fayette to have well guarded, and to &s;ee that nobody touched the two fore-ca&s;tle guns, and prevent any body from going up in the tops, where there were arms and ammuni|tions. I told the Fir&s;t-Lieutenant to &s;ee upon deck, and &s;ent another between decks to pre|vent any party of &s;eamen a&s;&s;embling together.</P>
<P>I &s;ent for the Armourer, told him to bring hand-cuffs and fore-locks in the cabin, and went there, where I found the Ma&s;ter's Mate; I a&s;ked him who were the ring-leaders, he told me the Ma&s;ter at Arms, who had the charge of the &s;mall-arms; the fir&s;t Serjeant of Marines, who had the care of the arm-che&s;t; and the fir&s;t Gunner's Mate. I &s;ent for the fir&s;t of tho&s;e, had him hand-cuff'd and put in the &s;tarboard quarter-gallery, under the guard of a Frenchman; the &s;econd was likewi&s;e &s;hut in the larboard quarter-gallery; and the third was, in the &s;ame way, put in the &s;tate-room. As &s;oon as tho&s;e three were well &s;ecured and parted, I &s;ent eight of the Frenchmen, under the command of an officer, to relieve the officers upon the quarter-deck, and went to de&s;ire the Marquis de la Fayette, the French gentlemen, the officers of the &s;hip and of marines, to a&s;&s;emble in the cabin to make a Court of Inquiry.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;ter at Arms was fir&s;t brought in; but he would own nothing: he was put again in the &s;ame place. The Serjeant of Marines was brought in next; he would own nothing before the Court, but he &s;aid to Col. Duplecix, who went with him to have him &s;ecured in the ward-room, that if the Court would &s;ave his life, he would di&s;clo&s;e all the plot. The Gunner's Mate being brought in, he owned the plot, and &s;aid the Ma&s;ter at Arms was the headmo&s;t of the ring-leaders, and had plann'd it in Bo&s;ton as he was employed in enli&s;ting the crew; that they were about eighty that agreed together to carry this horrid plot on, as they had determined to ran|&s;act almo&s;t every one except the Marquis de la Fayette, who&s;e life they would have &s;aved, ex|pecting to have a reward for him of the Engli&s;h government. He named &s;ome of the abettors,
<PB N="10" REF="018549_0010_0FA7AD6B6FFCB2D0">
which were in&s;tantly put in irons; he was &s;ent down the ward-room and &s;ecured there. The Serjeant was brought in again, and charged likewi&s;e the Ma&s;ter at Arms, and that he was the mover of the plot when at Bo&s;ton enli&s;ting the men: that the plan was, to take the &s;hip as &s;oon as &s;ailed out of Bo&s;ton, and carry her to New-York; but the company of the Frigate Deane, and the bad weather prevented their doing it then: that to put it in execution, they had agreed that one of them would go at the ma&s;t-head and cry out, a Sail, upon which all hands would be ordered to their quarters: that the Gunner's Mate, who had the management of the two fore-ca&s;tle guns, with all the fore-ca&s;tle forema&s;t men, which were in the plot, would help him to point on the quarter-deck and fire one thereof on one &s;ide, and the other on the other, to &s;weep off all they could, and all together, armed with crows and hand-&s;pikes, to ru&s;h on the quarter-deck, get ma&s;ters of the arm-che&s;ts and pikes; next de&s;troy all the Frenchmen on board, ex|cept the Marquis de la Fayette: the Captain was to be put in irons in one of the boats, and let loo&s;e at &s;ea; and &s;ome of the officers of the &s;hip were to be &s;kinned alive, &amp;c. We had thirty-eight put in irons, mo&s;t of which owned the plot; but the Ma&s;ter at Arms, though char|ged by all the others, did never own any thing. Having all the mo&s;t guilty in irons, in a clo&s;e birth between decks, well guarded by Frenchmen, a good guard upon the quarter-deck, and the Marquis de la Fayette, the French gentlemen and their &s;ervants, as well as all the offi|cers of the &s;hip, keeping guard day and night by hours, we left the Court of Inquiry, as it re|quired a regular Court-Martial to proceed further with the culprits, and proceeded on our pa&s;|&s;age. I have been particular in relating as conci&s;ely as po&s;&s;ible this affair, becau&s;e is was printed differently in the papers at Paris; and becau&s;e I think the infallible method to bring out a plot in a crew was taken, which will never fail in &s;uch ca&s;e: to the contrary, had the three ring-leaders been confined together, it would have been more difficult to bring the truth out of their own mouths.</P>
<P>On the fourth in&s;tant we &s;aw and came up with two Swedi&s;h ve&s;&s;els, one a &s;hip, the other a &s;now, coming la&s;t from Mounts-Bay, in England, where they had taken in their cargo: I or|dered the two Ma&s;ters thereof to bring their papers on board to be examined; but they brought but part of the nece&s;&s;ary one; I a&s;ked the officers opinions; they told me they appeared to be Engli&s;h property, and it was their advice to carry them into France to be examined. I &s;ent a crew on board each of them, and ordered them to the fir&s;t port they could make; but only the &s;hip arrived at Morlais: the &s;now was met with by an Engli&s;h privateer, which carried her to England. We arrived at Bre&s;t on the 6th February, where the Marquis de la Fayette and the French gentlemen landed the &s;ame day.</P>
<P>An hour after the Marquis de la Fayette was gone on &s;hore, the officers who I had not a word with during the pa&s;&s;age, &s;eeing that there was no witne&s;s left to &s;ee their conduct but my&s;elf, a&s;&s;embled and came all together in the cabin, and told me they were come to de&s;ire me to write to Dr. Franklin to &s;end them &s;ome money: I told them I could not, but that I would &s;end &s;omebody to him if they would all together write to him, and repre&s;ent their want of money; it would be the be&s;t way to obtain it, without &s;aying a word more about it. They a&s;ked me for their di&s;charge; I told them I could not give it. Some &s;aid they would not &s;tay in the &s;hip unle&s;s I would procure them &s;ome money, and they went all away grumbling.</P>
<P>The next day after I &s;ent Dr. Wind&s;hip, the &s;hip's head Surgeon, to Paris to carry to Dr. Franklin the pacquets I had for him; by whom I wrote to him that which had happened during our pa&s;&s;age; &s;ent him copy of what we had gathered from the mutineers; acquainted him with the want of papers produced by the two Swedi&s;h Ma&s;ters, to prove them neutral property; how the Frigate Alliance had &s;uffered, and wanted repair in her rigging, iron work, &amp;c. and
<PB N="11" REF="018549_0011_0FA7AD6C39A8B248">
begged of him his orders in general, and in particular concerning the mutineers and repairing the &s;hip. I wrote likewi&s;e to Mr. Shwighau&s;er, agent at Nantes, and &s;ent him the&s;e copies ju&s;t mentioned, and reque&s;ted of him his orders on tho&s;e topicks.</P>
<P>Some days after, Mon&s;ieur de Grogniard, the chief Engineer for the French navy, came the &s;ame day he arrived from Paris on board: he told me that if I would write to Mr. de Sartine, and reque&s;t of him the reward I expected for my former &s;ervice, he knew, from good authority, I &s;hould obtain it: I told him I could not, as I was in another &s;ervice then. He took the plan of two &s;liding gun carriages I had had made for the cabin &s;tern guns; admired the &s;hip's Car|penter's work, and went away.</P>
<P>In Dr. Franklin's an&s;wer of the 16th in&s;tant and following, he acquainted me with all the difficulties he met with to have the con&s;pirators tried, or put on &s;hore; of having the Frigate admitted in the port to be repaired, &amp;c. and ordered me to repair the &s;hip as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, but gave me no means whatever to do it. Mr. de Shwighau&s;er, on the other hand, gave po&s;|tive order to Mr. Cottentin, agent at Bre&s;t, to allow for the Alliance nothing el&s;e but the daily provi&s;ion for the crew. I could not even obtain old canvas to &s;erve the rigging with: though Dr. Franklin knew by all my letters, that I could not proceed to repair the &s;hip, every means to do it being refu&s;ed me, wrote to me to fit out the &s;hip and to give a rendezvous to fifteen American ve&s;&s;els, richly laden with nece&s;&s;ary articles for Congre&s;s, in order to convoy them home, which I could not do without having obtained means to repair the &s;hip: he wanted me to a&s;k him to go to Port l'Orient, I think, where was Capt. Jones, for he hinted it in one of his letters to me, &s;aying, "<HI>You and Mr. Shwighau&s;er mu&s;t judge whether they are be&s;t done, (&s;peaking of the &s;hrowd's iron plates) at Port l'Orient. I mentioned the latter place only becau&s;e I know they often fit large Indiamen there.</HI>" In the whole it appears that his Excellency B. Franklin <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> never intended that the Alliance &s;hould convoy the American ve&s;&s;els to America, but from the beginning contrived it &s;o, as to detain her until tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els were &s;ailed, to join her with Capt. Jones's &s;hip, which was fitting out at l'Orient, and that he played as well upon the Honourable John Adams <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> as upon others, as may be &s;een by the following certificate and by the &s;equel, viz.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>"THESE may certify, that on the eighth of March, <HI>1779,</HI> I &s;at off from Paris to Nantes, ex|pecting to meet the Alliance Frigate, and go in her to America. When arrived at Nantes, I learned from the American agent, that the Alliance was &s;till at Bre&s;t, and by Capt. Landais' letter it was uncertain how long &s;he would remain there; upon which I determined to take a journey to Bre&s;t, to a&s;&s;i&s;t, if I could, in expediting her.&mdash;Upon my arrival, there were thirty-eight pri&s;oners on board, charged with having been concerned in a mutiny, or con&s;piracy, in the pa&s;&s;age from Bo&s;ton, whom Capt. Landais had not been able to obtain permi&s;&s;ion to put them on &s;hore, which he thought nece&s;&s;ary to be done before he could go to &s;ea with &s;afety.</P>
<P>"The Frigate wanted &s;tores and repairs, which he could not obtain until &s;ome one would become re&s;pon&s;ible for the pay for them, which Mr. Cottentin declined doing until he had orders from the American Mini&s;ter at Court, or the American Agent at Nantes: that Mr. Cottentin on my arrival, told me he had ju&s;t received orders from Mr. Shwighau&s;er to take my advice, which he took accord|ingly, and engaged for what was wanted. And after an application from me and Capt. Landais, to the Intendent, and afterwards from me in writing, the pri&s;oners were permitted to be &s;ent on &s;hore, and the &s;tores and repairs were provided. Certified at the reque&s;t of Capt.

<P><PB N="12" REF="018549_0012_0FA7AD6CF7BEF348">I had wrote to his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> that there was left on board the Al|liance but 150 men in all, among which were at lea&s;t forty-odd of the con&s;pirators; and three-quarters of the re&s;t of the &s;eamen were Engli&s;hmen born. He wrote in an&s;wer, he was concer|ned I had &s;o few men, but nothing was done to procure me any; which might have been done ea&s;ily, as he knew that there was a cartel-&s;hip with Americans coming from pri&s;on, expected at Nantes.</P>
<P>I received a letter from Mr. Shwighau&s;er, who advi&s;ed me that an Engli&s;h cartel-&s;hip was arrived in Nantes' river, with ninety Americans on board, and ordered me to take on board the Alliance, &s;ame number Engli&s;h pri&s;oners from the guard-&s;hip, and carry them to Nantes.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t in the road of Bre&s;t, the officers behaved wor&s;e than ever; they went on &s;hore when they plea&s;ed, without acquainting me with it, knowing that I dur&s;t not put one under an ar|re&s;t, as they would all go: the Ma&s;ter was as bad as them. I told him three days running to have the haw&s;e cleared, he never would do it; and a&s;ked me his di&s;charge. Being ready to &s;ail, the Surgeon, with the advice of the Fir&s;t-Lieutenant, took the &s;hip's cutter, with &s;even men in her, and was three days ab&s;ent, I not knowing what was become of her; at la&s;t &s;he came, I took the Engli&s;h pri&s;oners on board, and &s;ailed out of Bre&s;t for Nantes on the 11th of April.&mdash;When we were, on the 18th in&s;tant, out&s;ide of the entry of the river of Nantes, the officers told me we were going upon a bank of &s;and; that the French coa&s;ting pilot did not know the entry of the river: &s;ome told me they had been there the year before, that the chanel was to the We&s;t of the rock called <HI>Grand Charpentier,</HI> and wanted me to go that way; but I brought to and waited for a pilot-boat of the river for a pilot, who &s;aid the other pilot was right, and if I had gone the way the officers would have me gone, the Frigate would &s;oon have been lo&s;t. The new pilot told me to have all po&s;&s;ible &s;ail &s;at; the Ma&s;ter being gone up|on deck on pretence to &s;ee that the cables were clear, I told the Second-Lieutenant, who was on watch, to have all &s;ail &s;at; he put down the &s;peaking-trumpet, laughed at me, and &s;aid he would not, as there was a pilot on board, I ordered the two other Lieutenants, one after the other, to have the &s;ails &s;at, but they would not order it; I took the &s;peaking-trumpet, being very nigh the rocks, and we got &s;afe, again&s;t my officers wi&s;hes, up the river as far as Menden, where we came at anchor before night.</P>
<P>During our pa&s;&s;age from Bre&s;t to Nantes, the Surgeon came to tell me that the Fir&s;t-Lieu|tenant and the Captain of Marines, propagated in the ward-room, before every body, that when we were there, the Captain of the harbour had told them I was a pea&s;ant, and he wonder|ed how Congre&s;s had entru&s;ted me with the command of the Alliance, &amp;c.

<P>Mr. Thevenard had wrote one al&s;o on the &s;ame &s;ubject to the Hon. John Adams, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> which proved enough that his opinion on my account, did not agree with what the Fir&s;t-Lieutenant and Captain of Marines had reported he &s;aid of me: but had it been &s;o, it would have proved their undutifulne&s;s and animo&s;ity in &s;preading a report which might come from an enemy.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t in Nantes, Jonathan Williams, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> invited me to a &s;plendid dinner at his hou&s;e; after which he took me a&s;ide and told me he had goods to &s;end to America: as the Frigate Alli|ance was going there, he would be glad if I would let them be &s;hipped in her; and added, that it was not with a view to &s;pare the freight, for he would pay it to me. I told him it was very generous in him, that in return I would &s;how him my unintere&s;tedne&s;s, in telling him to write to Dr. Franklin to &s;end me an order to do it; I would obey, with no other pro&s;pect than to oblige him: he &s;aid he did not chu&s;e it. The next day after, his uncle John Williams told me the goods his nephew had de&s;ired me to take in the Alliance, were not his own property, but were a quantity of bolts of canvas belonging to the Fir&s;t-Lieutenant of the Alliance. It &s;truck me, and I &s;u&s;pected at once it was a plan concerted to corrupt me, and after bring me guilty.</P>
<P>I had twenty of the Americans that came in the cartel-&s;hip, which preferred forty livres ad|vance to enli&s;t on board the Alliance, rather than 120 livres for the Bon-homme Richard; and I would have had every one had not the concerned in fitting out that &s;hip had them enli&s;t|ed before my arrival in Nantes' river.</P>
<P>His Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> wrote me a letter, dated April 24, 1779, in which he &s;aid,
<Q>"The American &s;hips which I propo&s;ed at fir&s;t you &s;hould convoy to America, being all &s;ailed, and the Alliance's return there &s;eemed not nece&s;&s;ary until &s;he had made a cruize: with the&s;e views, my orders now are, that you proceed fir&s;t to l'Orient, where you will receive your complement of men and &s;uch other things as may be nece&s;&s;ary for your cruize, and where you will meet the farther orders I am preparing to &s;end you."</Q></P>
<P>The American &s;hips were &s;aid to be at Aix-I&s;land yet, waiting for a convoy, but &s;ailed without any for America, and mo&s;t of them were taken in their pa&s;&s;age: they were not the only ones di&s;appointed in their expectation, as the Hon. John-Adams, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> had been &s;ome time on board the Alliance in hopes to go in her directly to America; but by this change of de&s;tina|tion, he &s;aw that he had been play'd upon (as his Excellency had wrote to me two months be|fore about his pa&s;&s;age) and that the detention of the Alliance in Bre&s;t appeared to me to give time to the Bon-homme Richard to be fitted out, and make the American &s;hips &s;ail without the Alliance's convoy.</P>

<P>Monday, May 10, 1779, the wind being fair, I &s;ailed from Nantes' river; in the afternoon the coa&s;ting pilot thought expedient, the wind being &s;hifted to the We&s;t, to play the &s;hip wind-ward between Beli&s;le-I&s;land and the adjacent rocks to the Main: he told me to have all hands to work the &s;hip, and to command my&s;elf, as he could not make him&s;elf be under&s;tood by the officers, which I did accordingly; but the Ma&s;ter being jealous to &s;ee me take the com|mand, and to prevent me thereof, anticipated upon the proper time, by giving the word too &s;oon in tacking about, to have main-&s;ail hawled, by which means the &s;hip mi&s;taking, &s;he was very nigh being lo&s;t upon the rocks: this he repeated &s;everal times; the pilot &s;tamped with his foot on the deck, &s;aid that man would have the &s;hip lo&s;t: being &s;en&s;ible of the danger thereof, to avoid it I told the pilot to give up the point, and to bear round about Beli&s;te-I&s;land, which we did.

</LETTER>
<P>The Hon. John Adams, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who had been on board the Alliance, always expecting that he would go to America in her, &s;eeing tho&s;e orders, appeared to be convinced he had been play'd upon all the while by His Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and being exa&s;perated thereat, exclaimed very highly again&s;t him for his keeping that Frigate in Europe to fulfil his own views, when &s;he was &s;o much wanted in America, and had mi&s;&s;ed rendering &s;o important a &s;er|vice in convoying the American &s;hips there, by being detained when at Bre&s;t.</P>
<P>For my part, I had had rea&s;ons from his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> &s;ufficient to decrea&s;e, in a great degree, the high opinion I had conceived for him; as when at Bre&s;t I had wrote to him a letter, &s;tating how the gratuity of the twelve thou&s;and livres promi&s;ed to me by Silas Deane, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a&s;&s;ented to by him, for carrying the &s;hip Flamand to America, had not been paid me there. But that, previous to my &s;ailing from thence, I had wrote and begged, that Congre&s;s, being confirmed by Silas Deane, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> how that &s;um was really due to me, would or|der it to be paid to me whil&s;t in France, and that I expected he had received, or would &s;oon re|ceive, order to pay it to me. In his fir&s;t an&s;wer he denied his being acquainted with that af|fair; but having wrote to him again particularly about that tran&s;action, his Excellency wrote to me a &s;econd an&s;wer, by which he &s;aid, "<HI>He doubted not Mr. Deane's communicating it to him,
<PB N="15" REF="018549_0015_0FA7AD6F4BE54DA8">
and that he might have approved of it</HI>"&mdash;But it was his opinion, that whatever agreement <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aid Deane made ought to be honorably complied with, and he made no doubt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Congre&s;s, when acquainted with the circum&s;tances, would do what is ju&s;t and proper; by which I thought he remembered it as well as I did, but would not own it, in order to make as much delay as po&s;&s;i|ble to that payment; and what appears to confirm it is, that Congre&s;s, after Silas Deane, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> had been long and was &s;till in Philadelphia, and had known my reque&s;t to have that &s;um paid to me whil&s;t in France, they re&s;olved the 15th of March, 1779, that &s;aid &s;um &s;hould be paid me there, and that Dr. Franklin &s;hould be directed to pay it to me; which he mu&s;t have known before the end of May, 1779, either by letters, or the pamphlets containing Congre&s;s's re&s;olves, tran&s;mitted to him, which he never owned to me, though I &s;poke &s;everal times to him about it, and &s;tay'd in France until July, 1780, which may make one &s;u&s;pect that one of his inducements for keeping me there, and doing all he did after again&s;t me, was to prevent my com|ing to America, by which I would not learn &s;aid re&s;olve, and he might keep that &s;um from me.</P>
<P>His Excellency's letter to me about Mr. Hezekiah Ford, coroborated, in my opinion, with his impolitical and improper dealing, which I have had too many proofs of as will appear.</P>
<P>As I wanted to convince the Hon. John Adams, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> more fully yet, that what the Fir&s;t-Lieutenant had &s;aid again&s;t my character was a calumny, I de&s;ired him to come before him, where I told him that, be&s;ides his undutifulne&s;s in all re&s;pects, it had been reported to me, that he had &s;aid things on board again&s;t me, which mu&s;t be proved true or fal&s;e, as there was a fair opportunity of knowing which of the two, and in con&s;equence thereof, went with him before the Commander, and a&s;ked the Lieutenant whether he knew the Commander, he &s;aid no; and the Commander &s;aid he had never &s;een the man. I explained to the Lieutenant that it was that gentleman who&s;e name was Mr. Thevenard, who was the Captain of the harbour of Bre&s;t when we were there, which he had &s;aid told him things again&s;t my character.</P>
<P>I don't know what encouragement Capt. Jones gave to the officers of the Alliance, but he en|tertained them daily, and their undutifulne&s;s encrea&s;ed in&s;tantly. The &s;hip called the Bon-homme Richard, which he was fitting out, was but a very precarious command, as the con|cerned in her might every moment change her de&s;tination, or Captain: but the Alliance was a fine and pretty good Frigate, which he could not de&s;pi&s;e the command of, and which was worth &s;ome of his attention; and he had kept a corre&s;pondence, I was told &s;ince &s;he arrived fir&s;t in France, with the Captain of Marines on board, who he had had made an officer &s;ome time be|fore in the American navy, and which I always &s;u&s;pected, to promote Capt. Jones's intere&s;t among&s;t my officers to my prejudice.</P>
<P>On the other hand, a Lieutenant in the American navy, who had known Capt. Jones in America, and had been under his orders, gave me a very bad character of him: having learn|ed this, &s;eeing my officers undutifulne&s;s increa&s;ing, and their inventions again&s;t my character, which might be augmented and &s;upported by Capt. Jones, if he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to come to his end; having not a man on board upon who&s;e veracity I could depend; having already proofs of the ways of dealing of his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> the only one I could apply to for redre&s;s.</P>
<P>Having well con&s;idered on my dreadful po&s;ition, I fore&s;aw that, one day or other, I mu&s;t be &s;acrificed, either to the old plan and jealou&s;y of my officers, which would not &s;pare the lo&s;s of the Frigate to &s;atiate their animo&s;ity again&s;t me: to the ambition of Capt. Jones, to have the command of the Frigate Alliance; or to the views and intere&s;t of his Excellency: and that it was impo&s;&s;ible for me alone to do any great things for the &s;ervice, having the undu|tifulne&s;s of the fir&s;t always ready, by their di&s;obedience and oppo&s;ition, to make all my plans
<PB N="16" REF="018549_0016_0FA7AD71A7AFC270">
and orders mi&s;carry. The &s;econd who might give me ambigous orders by which he might ap|propriate to him&s;elf the &s;ucce&s;s, and charge me with the misfortunes which might happen: and the third who might refu&s;e me ju&s;tice. On the other hand, though I had &s;pent already a great deal of money &s;ince I was in the American &s;ervice, I would have con&s;ented to lo&s;e it, and the &s;um due to me to get clear, with honor, of the command of the Alliance: but I could not in a foreign country leave her, after Congre&s;s had been &s;o generous to intru&s;t her to my care, without proper documents from his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to ju&s;tify my nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ignation and retreat from her.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence I wrote (the copy has been lo&s;t or took from my papers) as much as I can remember, for the fir&s;t and only time to his Excellency B. Franklin <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> about the Alliance's officers undutifulne&s;s, that a Captain cannot do every thing by him&s;elf, but mu&s;t have officers willing to, and that &s;ee his orders executed; otherwi&s;e &s;oon or late he mu&s;t mi&s;carry: if tho&s;e who are to obey him do exert their animo&s;ity again&s;t him, in de&s;troying all &s;ubordination by which a Frigate may be every moment in danger to be lo&s;t, &amp;c. that I had rather &s;een another Captain named commander of the Alliance, than to expo&s;e her any more, and my honor, with tho&s;e that &s;pared nothing to de&s;troy both, in order to hurt me: that I was con&s;cious of the honor Congre&s;s had be&s;towed on me in giving me the command of the Frigate Alliance; and nothing but her &s;afety, and my long &s;uffering, and anxiety on board of her, by the mi&s;conduct of the officers, could have induced me to write him this.</P>
<P>"<HI>His Excellency B. Franklin E&s;q'rs an&s;wer of May</HI> 19<HI>th</HI> 1779, <HI>was that he was exceedingly afflicted of that I had wrote to him about the officers, that at the di&s;tance he was, he could but leave the matter to Commodore Jones, who&s;e authority, with the aid of Court-Martial, if nece&s;&s;ary, would be &s;ufficient to compo&s;e the&s;e di&s;&s;entions.</HI></P>
<P>Though I was warn'd again&s;t Capt. Jones's character, by all I heard &s;aid of him, either by American and Engli&s;h gentlemen, and had been told he wanted to &s;ecure the command of the Alliance to him&s;elf: I thought nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;ome change in my &s;ituation, and in con|&s;equence I applied to him for a Court-Martial, to judge between my officers and me. But either by Captain Jones's councils to the officers, or by the officers con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt, they refu&s;ed, he told me, to &s;ubmit to that Court, becau&s;e there were three French Captains who would &s;et in it, and they would not be judged by Frenchmen. I told him, that if he could form one, of all Americans, I would &s;ubmit to it; he gave me no an&s;wer, and I thought no more about it.</P>
<P>Better than a week after, being on &s;hore on the &s;hip's bu&s;ine&s;s, Captain Jones called me in from Jonathan Williams E&s;q'rs chamber-windows, I went in, he acquainted me then for the fir&s;t time, that he had &s;elected five American gentlemen; of which number was Mr. Williams, and that they were to meet together in half an hour's time, to hear and judge the difference between me, and my officers. I a&s;ked Captain Jones whether he had acquainted the officers thereof, and who were tho&s;e five gentlemen, and if they approved of his choice, he &s;aid yes: I told him, I was &s;urpri&s;ed that he had never let me know before that &s;uch things was to be done, though he had advi&s;ed and con&s;ulted my officers about it, that I &s;aw his plan, however I would &s;ubmit to it, and go there in half an hour, but I mu&s;t &s;ee &s;ome body fir&s;t; and went a|way directly to acquaint Mr. le Ray de Chaumont, who was the French and American Mini|&s;ter's agent, to whom I related what pa&s;&s;ed; he looked very indi&s;po&s;ed again&s;t this plan, and hinted that if &s;uch tricks as taking the Alliance from me took place, I would have the com|mand of the Bon-homme Richard given to me; I was going out to &s;ee &s;ome body el&s;e when I met Captain Jones in the &s;treet, who told me that that Court &s;hould not take place, and a&s;ked me
<PB N="17" REF="018549_0017_0FA7AD74AC9AB768">
if I knew Captain Robi&s;on of South-Carolina, that he had wrote to him to come from Nantes, and could be in two days arrived, and would &s;et in the Court as Pre&s;ident. I &s;aid I did not care who &s;hould &s;it as Pre&s;ident; but as there were thirty American gentlemen then in l'Orient, I reque&s;ted they would be all invited to come in the Court, and that every one who would might be admitted to &s;it as a member of &s;aid Court.</P>
<P>Capt. Jones appointed a day for the Court (&s;tyled Court of Honor) to meet on board the Alliance. He &s;ubmitted the li&s;t of the members to the officers: I don't know whether they objected again&s;t any one; but there were but &s;eventeen &s;itting, among which Capt. Robin&s;on Pre&s;ident; (I was told after) had the promi&s;e of Capt. Jones to have the command of the Al|liance, Mr. Williams, Judge-Advocate, a man devoted to Capt. Jones, and Mr. Amiel, the Fir&s;t-Lieutenant of the Bon-homme Richard, who was another who had very likely &s;ome pro|mi&s;e of Capt. Jones, for helping to take the command from me; all the re&s;t were very impar|tial, I think, being mo&s;tly of Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>The officers fir&s;t charge again&s;t me was, that I preferred Mr. Blodget's company to theirs: I &s;aid I did, becau&s;e he behaved always with civility to me, and they never did.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t-Lieutenant &s;aid I never ordered in the &s;torm we had four days after &s;ailing from Bo&s;ton, to have the guns howled in; I an&s;wered to the contrary, I ordered &s;ix tons of pig-iron balla&s;t to be took from out the hold and put between decks, becau&s;e &s;he rolled too hard wind|ward, and it would have been wor&s;e had the guns been how&s;ed in.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t-Lieutenant &s;aid that, whil&s;t at Bre&s;t, I had never ordered the exerci&s;e of the great guns to be done: I &s;aid they had orders to exerci&s;e the great guns; and the Captain of Ma|rines to exerci&s;e the Marines when ever the weather and the &s;hip's bu&s;ine&s;s permitted; and &s;ent in the ward-room for their book of orders, and &s;howed to the Court it was the fir&s;t order in it.</P>
<P>The Captain of Marines &s;aid I had never introduced any one of them in French company: I &s;aid that I had not, becau&s;e I thought the company they kept and tho&s;e I u&s;ed to &s;ee, were quite different.</P>
<P>The Second-Lieutenant &s;aid I &s;lighted my officers, and &s;howing his left-hand, added he had lo&s;t two of his fingers in the American &s;ervice: I an&s;wered that I would have never &s;lighted my officers had they not forgot they were &s;uch; that it was unfortunate to have lo&s;t two fin|gers, but it gave no right to undutifulne&s;s.</P>
<P>Then I related their undutifulne&s;s in the entry of the river of Nantes: they denied the fact, and produced a witne&s;s, but he declared it was as I had &s;aid; by which evidence they appeared too guilty, and the Court &s;aid they were not competent judges, as &s;uch undutifulne&s;s required the immediate juri&s;diction of a Court-Martial.</P>
<P>An American gentleman came from Nantes to l'Orient, having heard of the plan going on again&s;t me, and that Capt. Jones wanted to take the Alliance from me, which he had promi|&s;ed to Capt. Robin&s;on, who was prevented to &s;it any longer in the Court by him. I gave no other charges again&s;t the officers, as the Court had &s;aid they were not competent judges; and I would have forgot all, if the officers would have promi&s;ed to be dutiful: but Capt. Robin&s;on being prevented &s;itting in the Court, put an end to it. Capt. Jones, being di&s;appointed, ne|ver gave me the judgment of the Court; but I have had it &s;ince&mdash;it is as follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>"In compliance with your reque&s;t, contained in your letter of the tenth in&s;tant directed to A.

</LETTER>
<P>By the above it appears that &s;aid Court judged the Lieutenants had no real cau&s;e of com|plaint again&s;t me: but the Court don't &s;ay that I had not &s;ufficient rea&s;on of complaint again&s;t the&s;e Lieutenants; and are &s;ilent on that account, becau&s;e they were not competent judges of the fir&s;t charge and the only one (being &s;topped by the Court) I charged the Lieutenants of.</P>
<P>Captain Jones being di&s;appointed by the above judgment (of which he never &s;poke to me) affected to &s;how me more confidence than ever: he wanted me to make the book of &s;ignals, but I told him I could not, as I was compelled to go on &s;hore for the lea&s;t thing wanted, having no body in the &s;hip who could &s;peak French but my&s;elf; and the &s;ervice on board required my pre&s;ence all the time I was not bu&s;y on &s;hore: however Capt. Cottineau of the Pallas made &s;aid book of &s;ignals and had it printed for him.</P>
<P>A few days before we were ready to &s;ail, it was reported to me, that the Fir&s;t-Lieutenant had all the bolts of canvas heretofore mentioned, on board; and that they had been there ever &s;ince the &s;hip's cutter had been away from the &s;hip in Bre&s;t three days, and brought them on board, when at Bre&s;t; I &s;ent for him, and told him I could not &s;uffer them to remain in the &s;hip, having orders to the contrary, and to make him mind what I &s;aid, I told him if I found them in the &s;hip, I would have them thrown overboard; and I went on &s;hore on purpo&s;e to give him an opportunity to take them out of the &s;hip; which he did, and he with the Second-Lieu|tenant went away and never returned on board the &s;hip again: the reader mu&s;t con&s;ider, by the by, had I granted Jonathan Williams, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to have tho&s;e goods on board, or his uncle John Williams that the Fir&s;t-Lieutenant might have them on board, it would have been brought in by the court, again&s;t me, by which the &s;hip would have been taken from me.</P>
<P>Capt. Jones perceiving that Lieutenant Brown of the Navy and Mr. Amiel the two Fir&s;t-Lieu|tenants of the Bon-homme Richard, Mr. Dick, the Capt. of Marines, would not &s;toop to be his tools to all intents and purpo&s;es, found out &s;ome way or other to di&s;charge them, and replaced others who&s;e delicacy would never cau&s;e them to be di&s;charged by Capt. Jones. On the 17th of June, 1779, the Bon-homme Richard, Alliance, Pallas, Vengeance, and Cutter Cerf, &s;ailed out of port l'Orient to Groay-I&s;land: and on the 19th in&s;tant we &s;ailed from thence all toge|ther
<PB N="19" REF="018549_0019_0FA7AD75F3BBA318">
with a number of ve&s;&s;els under our convoy, which were going to Rochefort, Bourdeaux, &amp;c. At &s;even o'clock, P. M. all the fleet hove to on the larboard tack (the i&s;le Dieu bore from S. E. by E. to S. E. by S. of us) under the three top-&s;ails, &s;ettled on the caps with the main and mizen-top-&s;ails back'd. At midnight, going upon the quarter-deck, I met Lieutenant Degge, who was then the Fir&s;t-Lieutenant (the Ma&s;ter, named Mr. Buckley, and a Mid&s;hip|man called Lynd, acted both as Second and Third-Lieutenants) who told me that the Bon-homme Richard and the Pallas were both pretty nigh, one by our weather-bow, the other by the lee, and that we were about the middle of the fleet. As &s;oon as I was on the quarter-deck I perceived the windward &s;hip, which was about three cable<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s length in the wind's eye of us, bearing away without any &s;ignal whatever; thinking her to be the Pallas, I hailed her in French, and told her &s;he would come and board us if they did not take care; but by the confu&s;ed voices I heard on board of her, I &s;oon knew her to be the Bon-homme Richard; I ordered the helm a-weather, to &s;heaver the after &s;ails, hoi&s;t up the fore-top-&s;ail, and run up the gibb; at the &s;ame in&s;tant, not conceiving that the Bon-homme Richard would wear &s;hip in the night, and in the middle of a fleet, brought to, without making a &s;ignal therefor fir&s;t, and knowing mo&s;t of her crew was compo&s;ed of Engli&s;h &s;eamen, took out of the pri&s;ons, which had already muti|ned in the port of l'Orient, and very likely would not mi&s;s a fair opportunity, if they found it, to get ma&s;ters of that &s;hip: I imagined they had done it, as I heard them cry and &s;cream all to|gether as if they had been murdering one another; and thinking they were coming to board us on purpo&s;e, I a&s;k'd Capt. Park whether he had the key of the arm-che&s;t, he &s;aid no; in that very moment when the Alliance began to move a-head, but not enough to an&s;wer her helm, the Bon-homme Richard boarded her windward on our larboard &s;ide ju&s;t off the main &s;hrowds, car|ried away our mizen-ma&s;t, driver boom; cut our quarter down to the deck; broke the mizen-chain's plate, the quarter-gallery, &amp;c. &amp;c. Seeing all the men upon the fore-ca&s;tle and bow|&s;prit of the Bon-homme Richard, and being &s;till per&s;uaded they were going to jump on board, I &s;tepped in the cabin and a&s;ked a negro for my pi&s;tols, who told me they were lock'd up in one of my trunks; I went up again and ordered to cut any of the Bon-homme Richard or Alliance's rigging which kept the two &s;hips fa&s;t together, which being done we went ahead and got clear. The next morning I had a mizen &s;ail rigged properly in&s;tead of a &s;now &s;ail, and at ten o'clock, A. M. the Alliance was reduced to a &s;now, &s;ailed and worked thus very well.</P>
<P>At noon I went on board the Bon-homme Richard, and told Capt. Jones that I had never heard before of a &s;hip wearing in the middle of a fleet in the night, without making &s;ignal therefor; and that I was &s;o far from thinking it, that I a&s;cribed that manoeuvre to a mutiny from the Engli&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> board his &s;hip: he replied, that the Bon-homme Richard had much &s;uffered, as all her head and cut-water had been carried away, and her bow&s;prit was &s;prung, &amp;c. thereby.</P>
<P>The ve&s;&s;els under our convoy went into Rochefort and Bourdeaux on the 21&s;t in&s;tant, and we kept cruizing going we&s;tward.</P>
<P>On the 22d in&s;tant, at four o'clock, P.

<P>On the 26th in&s;t. by want of &s;ignal made on board the Bon-homme Richard during the night, the Alliance and Pallas lo&s;t &s;ight of her and kept company together.&mdash;On the 28th in&s;t. fell in with a brig under Engli&s;h colours, made her come to; &s;he proved to be called the Three Friends belonging to Dublin, bound there from Bordeaux, loaded with wine and brandy, having French and Engli&s;h papers dated 1778, but none from the American Mini&s;ter in France, for which rea&s;on I thought it my duty to carry her in to be examined.

<P>I had her into l'Orient delivered to Me&s;&s;i'rs Gourlade and Moylon, took their and Mr. Le Ray de Chaumont's certificate how I had put her under their care. And I wrote to his Excel|lency B. Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> on my arrival about her.</P>

When the tide came up again we had her off without any damage to appearance, but as &s;he had been on an unlevel and rocky ground and was very foul, I thought it prudent to have her careened, her bottom cleaned and repair the damages if there was any; and though I was no longer under Capt. Jones's orders by tho&s;e I had from His Excellency B. Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> I a&s;ked his advice, which was to have it done. I went in on the 7th in&s;t. and had her careened accordingly, and went out of the harbour on the 20th.</P>
<P>Capt. Cottineau of the Pallas, on our arrival at Groais had wrote to Mr. Le Ray de Chaumont, that Capt. Jones was incapable of commanding a fleet what ever, and that the accident which had happened on board the Bon-homme Richard and Alliance, and the &s;eparation was owing to want of &s;ignals being made on board the Bon-homme Richard, &amp;c. &amp;c. Mr. Le Ray de Chau|mont had told it to &s;omebody el&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d Capt. Jones had been made acquainted with it; and he thir&s;ted for vengeance again&s;t Mr. Cottineau: One day being on board the Bon-homme Richard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e flattered me much and paid me great compliment on the expedition I had made in having the Alliance careened in &s;o &s;hort a time with no other help but her crew; after thinking that he had &s;oothed me enough he a&s;ked me what I thought of Capt. Cottineau; I told him I thought well of him: Capt. Jones told me &s;omebody had wrote to Paris again&s;t him, and a&s;ked me whether I thought he had done his duty during the cruize we had made, I an&s;wered I had not wrote to Paris at all; &s;eeing that I did not an&s;wer his purpo&s;e he a&s;ked me, on the 22d ultimo when we &s;aw three &s;ails, did we not cha&s;e them as &s;oon as Capt.

Cottineau thought he knew more than others, becau&s;e he had made the book of &s;ignals, which he could have made him&s;elf; however he dur&s;t never &s;peak to Capt. Cottineau about it, nor bring him before a Court-Martial for his pretended running away.&mdash;After a while he appeared calm and told me he was going to order a Court-Martial to try a party of his crew who had made a plot to get ma&s;ters of the &s;hip, in order to carry her to the enemies.</P>
<P>Capt. Jones accordingly appointed a Court-Martial, and we &s;at and tried a number of his people; and as I &s;at as Pre&s;ident, I went to acquaint him &s;everal times that the man or men tried were acquitted; at which he always look'd angry, and &s;everal times &s;aid we would acquit them all. The la&s;t one who was tried when I &s;at in the Court was a Jer&s;eyman, who was con|victed to have &s;aid to other Engli&s;hmen that he wi&s;hed to meet with an Engli&s;h 74 man-of-war becau&s;e the Bon-homme Richard would be taken without fighting, and he &s;hould go to his country and &s;ee his family: the Court agreed that &s;uch words were very licentious and dange|rous to be &s;pread among &s;uch a crew, and that the man de&s;erved to be puni&s;hed for an example,
<PB N="22" REF="018549_0022_0FA7AD7837D2A640">
not with death, but with la&s;hes; and that all the members &s;hould give by ballot (that is by writing the number of la&s;hes the criminal was to receive upon a billet, and that the &s;um &s;hould be divided by the number of the members &s;itting) the number thereof they thought he de&s;erved to receive to puni&s;h him and make an example: accordingly, every one having given me their ticket, Capt. Cottineau, who &s;at at my right, helped to open them, found in one of them wrote <HI>hung,</HI> he &s;howed it to me; I a&s;ked who could wrote that after the Court had agreed that the man tried de&s;erved nothing but la&s;hes; every one di&s;owned having wrote the billet where it was wrote <HI>hung.</HI> I told that every one mu&s;t take again their own ticket; we did, &s;o the ticket on which was wrote <HI>hung</HI> was left on the table, and one of the members without ticket, which proved him to be the owner thereof (he was one that I have mentioned heretofore, which Capt. Jones had recruited to reimplace the officers he had di&s;charged.) Several of the Court exclaimed at him; he being confu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, &s;aid that Capt. Jones wanted the man to be hung, and took his ticket and wrote upon another five hundred la&s;hes: the Court exclaimed at him again, &s;aying they were not a&s;&s;embled there to do Capt. Jones's will, but they were to do ju&s;tice, and his billet was not at all received. I went and carried the &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed to Capt. Jones, and told him of that officer &s;aying that he, Capt. Jones, wanted to have the man hung: Capt. Jones replied, that if he had &s;at upon the Court he would have cro&s;s-que&s;tioned the culprit in &s;uch manner that he would have proved more guilty, and made an example of. I told him I had no &s;uch art, and would never give my vote again&s;t a man without I knew, by impartial evidences, that the man tried was guilty, and would judge then, in my own con&s;cience, of the puni&s;hment. Capt. Jones told me I could &s;it no longer in the Court, as it was to try who was guilty for the Bon-homme Richard and the Alliance boarding one another on the 19th ultimo. Being one of the party, I thought he meant that, having been the &s;ufferer by being the Captain of the Alliance which had been boarded, I could not &s;it for fear of partiality; I &s;aid very well.</P>
<P>The next day following a Court &s;at, I was &s;ent for there and told, that it was reported 'twas the Alliance which had boarded the Bon-homme Richard; in a minute's time I demon&s;trated that all the fleet was brought to on the larboard tack, the Bon-homme Richard lying in the wind's eye of the Alliance, con&s;equently that the Alliance being brought to could not go in the wind's eye to board the Bon-homme Richard there; but on the contrary the Bon-homme Richard wear|ing, without &s;howing any &s;ignal, had boarded the Alliance, tho' I had ordered the helm a-weather, &amp;c. but that the Alliance not an&s;wering her helm, having no head way, could not avoid it; and though Capt. Jones had very likely a &s;trong party in that Court, they told me that it was enough, and I went about my bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>But Capt. Jones not being able to put his fault, in that re&s;pect, upon me, looked for another victim to lay it upon, in order to clear him&s;elf before tho&s;e in Paris who had been told of his i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bility in that in&s;tance: his Fir&s;t-Lieutenant, who was called Capt. Rob&s;on, of New-London, (I was told) who was very &s;ick upon his bed at l'Orient, was pitched upon; and though I never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that Capt. Jones had ordered a &s;ignal to be made (by which he was the only guilty) tho' all the Bon-homme Richard's Quarter-ma&s;ter, who &s;teered the &s;hip, were Engli&s;hmen known to be ill-minded, and may have de&s;ignedly or by mi&s;take boarded the Alliance, though it was moral<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y impo&s;&s;ible in the night for Lieutenant Rob&s;on to wear &s;uch a &s;hip as the Bon-homme Richard, in the middle of a fleet brought to, which went, &s;ome a&s;tern, others ahead, without boarding one or the other: not being in a condition to make his defence, he was condemned as appears by &s;ome influence in the Court, to be &s;u&s;pended for a year and &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed therefor.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="018549_0023_0FA7AD78F604B088">Capt. Jones fearing that Lieutenant Rob&s;on after being recovered, being an American, would, before the twelve months of &s;u&s;pen&s;ions were expired or after, &s;peak with other officers better acquainted with the rule of &s;ervice than he was, who would advi&s;e him how and who to apply for redre&s;s for the inju&s;tice he had received, and at &s;ame time might have &s;howed that all the fault was Capt. Jones's; he, Capt. Jones, imagined to have Lieutenant Rob&s;on broke and rendered incapable of &s;erving his country, by which he &s;hould be deprived of any intercour&s;e with the Navy-Officers and would be forgotten as being really guilty: according to his views he &s;poke to me of it and told me the &s;entence given by the Court again&s;t Lieutenant Rob&s;on was incon&s;i&s;tent with the fault committed, as if he was faulty, being a middling-age man, after having been &s;o long a &s;ea-faring man, it could be expected growing old he would lo&s;e rather than gain the knowledge of working a &s;hip, and never become a good officer, of con|&s;equence he would always be incapable of being a Lieutenant in the &s;ervice, and of cour&s;e he was going to have a Court appointed to annihilate the former &s;entence and have Lieutenant Rob&s;on rendered incapable of &s;erving in the American Navy: I told him that I thought al&s;o the for|mer &s;entence was incon&s;i&s;tent and unju&s;t as I thought Lieutenant Rob&s;on guiltle&s;s, thinking 'twas unavoidable for him to board one &s;hip or another in &s;uch circum&s;tances; but &s;uppo&s;ing him ever &s;o guilty, &s;ince the Court-Martial had pa&s;&s;ed a &s;entence, they could not revoke it and make another, by which the puni&s;hment would be aggravated, and that no power in America could do it; he &s;aid he would have it done.</P>
<P>Capt. Jones had accordingly the day after a Court appointed, and went in it him&s;elf, and by his influence there and &s;ome of his &s;pecious rea&s;ons, had the former &s;entence broke and a new one pa&s;&s;ed, by which Lieutenant Rob&s;on was broke and rendered incapable to &s;erve his country (as was reported to me by the Alliance's officers &s;itting there) a deed that none but an arbitra|ry power could effect; and Lieutenant Rob&s;on was inhumanly left &s;ick without being paid his wages, compelled to receive alms, and now perhaps is bewailing his mi&s;ery with his family, in &s;ome corner of America, his unde&s;erved di&s;grace and appearance of di&s;honour, though he was innocent.</P>
<P>The Surgeon of the Alliance imparted to me the news he had from America, viz. that the Captains of the Warren and that of the Queen of France, both United States' men-of-war had &s;everally received orders in Bo&s;ton to go together upon a cruize, and to carry the ve&s;&s;els they could take into one the Southern States' harbour, but that they had brought them in Bo&s;ton, wherefore both Captains was &s;u&s;pended, the &s;enior one for going there again&s;t his orders and the minor for following his Commodore again&s;t his orders, by which I learned that a Captain was not to follow a &s;enior officer when he had his own orders given to him to the contrary, and that he was to go ab&s;olutely to the place directed to.</P>
<P>Pur&s;uant literally to the orders I had had from his Excellency B. Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> dated April 28, 1779, I had joined Capt. Jones and had been under his orders cruizing, &amp;c. until the 2d July following, when we returned and anchored in France, therefore they were fulfilled.</P>

<P>I &s;igned the above agreement after having read it and found nothing contrary or derogatory to his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, E&s;q'rs orders, or the intere&s;t of any one officer or forema&s;t man of the Alliance; as in the fir&s;t article it was ju&s;t that the &s;enior officer &s;hould have the command by preference to a junior one; and that any one who was not directed by his Mi|ni&s;ter's orders to remain in &s;aid &s;quadron, could, if he thought nece&s;&s;ary, retire. In the &s;econd article it was likewi&s;e ju&s;t to &s;erve whil&s;t in &s;aid &s;quadron, in con&s;equence of one &s;eniority in the American navy, and under the American flag. In the third it was right to have the prizes &s;hared according to the American law, and to &s;ubmit to the two Mini&s;ters to regulate the &s;hare of each &s;hip. By the fourth it was indi&s;pen&s;able that any one who had private orders from his Mini&s;ter &s;hould execute them, having no regard to part the &s;quadron, if nece&s;&s;ary to fulfil them: and Mr. Le Ray de Chaumont, being the real Agent of France and the United States, employ|ed as &s;uch by the French and the United States' Mini&s;ters; and had provided for the expences in fitting out the Alliance as well as other ve&s;&s;els, and to who&s;e orders were to be directed the prizes. That by the fifth article he, Mr. Le Ray de Chaumont, &s;hould be de&s;ired to be an&s;werable for the &s;hares of the &s;hip's company, in his own name, for tho&s;e he directed the prizes to be &s;ent to, as his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who had made him Agent for the Alliance, mu&s;t be an&s;werable for him to Congre&s;s for the United States' &s;hare and the &s;hip's company, if he failed, &amp;c. The &s;ixth article was very proper. The &s;eventh very natural: And the eighth article I could have no objection to.</P>
<P>Being all ready, we &s;ailed in the Alliance, Saturday, Augu&s;t 14, 1779, in company with the Bon-homme Richard, Pallas, Mon&s;ieur, brig Vengeance, brig Grenville, and cutter Cerf.</P>
<P>On the 19th in&s;tant, the Mon&s;ieur privateer cha&s;ed and came up with a Dutch &s;hip, which in her pa&s;&s;age from Spain to Holland had been taken by a privateer belonging to Liverpool; the Mon&s;ieur's Captain took on board &s;ome bales of &s;ilk goods out of her, which Capt. Jones pre|tended to have a right to have on board the Bon-homme Richard, which the Captain of the Mon&s;ieur did not think proper nor &s;afe for him to do, and made him and the prize depart from our company.</P>
<P>The next morning wind pretty fre&s;h S. E. &s;aw and &s;ignaled five &s;ails in the wind's eye at a great di&s;tance, the Bon-homme Richard made a &s;ignal for the Alliance to cha&s;e, which we did after the large&s;t; at noon being upon contrary tacks and in her wake, about nine miles di&s;tance, we tacked about, but the wind lulling and &s;hifting to the E. N. E. &s;he bore two points wind|ward at &s;ame di&s;tance; we being then about four miles di&s;tance in the wind's eye of the Bon-homme Richard who made &s;ignal about two o'Clock, P. M. which we could not di&s;cern, the weather being hazy, and from our po&s;ition, which I &s;uppo&s;ed to be for joining the Alliance to the fleet, as the &s;ea was pretty rough and we could gain none hardly. However, not being cer|tain of the &s;ignal, I kept cha&s;ing yet, imagining, from the beginning of the cha&s;e, that Captain
<PB N="27" REF="018549_0027_0FA7AD7C0165AE68">
Jones would &s;end the cutter Cerf, which was the fitte&s;t ve&s;&s;el to gain in the wind's eye to recon|noitre the cha&s;e, at lea&s;t that he would order &s;aid cutter to get between the Bon-home Richard and the Alliance, to repeat the &s;ignals, which was not done; at four we gained very little upon the cha&s;e which was yet above &s;even miles di&s;tance in the wind's eye; &s;he made a lee lurch, we did the &s;ame to try to draw her to cha&s;e us, &s;eeing it was impo&s;&s;ible to come up with her, but &s;he came clo&s;e to the wind again; the night coming on I bore away to join the fleet, which I did about 9 o'clock, P. M. and told Capt. Jones that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> cha&s;e had appeared to be as large as a fifty gun &s;hip or an Ea&s;t-India-man, but could not well judge what &s;he was, the weather being very hazy.</P>
<P>We all kept clo&s;e to the wind all night, and the next day &s;aw the &s;ame large &s;hip, and all together gave cha&s;e to her, but the &s;ea being rough ahead, the Bon-homme Richard cut &s;ailed fa&s;t the Alliance, and was above two miles ahead of us, gaining very fa&s;t upon the cha&s;e, when a little brig called the May-Flower, from Limerick to London, loaded with beef and butter, &s;truck her colour; the Bon-homme Richard gave up the cha&s;e after the large &s;hip, though he could have continued it, as he could have the brig manned by five men by the Vengeance which was a&s;tern of her. Capt. Jones kept all the fleet brought to from 5 o'Clock, P. M. until 10, to man the prize and have potatoes, &amp;c. brought from the prize on board his &s;hip, at which the Alliance's crew grumbled much, &s;aying that they ought to have their &s;hare thereof, and hinted it was my fault if they had not, however the prize was ordered to France, where &s;he arrived &s;afe.</P>
<P>On the 23d in&s;tant, at 1 o'clock, A. M. the Pallas, who had been out of &s;ight, appeared by our weather beam, the Bon-homme Richard who was half a mile ahead of us, on &s;ame tack we were, fired &s;everal &s;hots at her, tacked about without &s;howing a &s;ignal for the fleet &s;o to do, but after being tacked &s;he hoi&s;ted at her mizen yard three lanthorns therefor, but having her mizen &s;heeted off, it prevented our &s;eeing the &s;ignal at all, and the fir&s;t thing we perceived was the Bon-homme Richard within two mu&s;ket &s;hots, upon contrary tack, coming right again&s;t us at the rate of &s;ix knots, and the Alliance as much, by which both &s;hips would have &s;unk one another had they fully boarded; but I ordered main-&s;ail haul and let go and haul all at once, which was done in an in&s;tant, by which all our &s;ails were upon the ma&s;t, and the Bon-homme Richard's quarter gallery pa&s;&s;ed within two feet of the Alliance's gib-boom; Lieutenant Degge who was upon the Alliance's fore-ca&s;tle was &s;o exa&s;perated at the bad and dangerous manner of the Bon-homme Richard's way working, that he told Capt. Jones he would &s;ink along &s;ide of the Bon-homme Richard; this I was told &s;ince.</P>
<P>At 8 o'clock, A. M. made the land, which we found to be Cape-Buff, in Ireland.</P>
<P>On the 24th in&s;tant, at 11 o'clock, A. M. the Alliance being a mile a&s;tern of the Bon-hom|me Richard we &s;aw a &s;ail bearing N. N. W. we &s;hewed &s;ignal therefor, and &s;at all &s;ails in order to cha&s;e her, the &s;ea being very &s;mooth; at one o'clock, P. M. we pa&s;&s;ed along &s;ide of the Bon-homme Richard as if &s;he had been at anchor; &s;he &s;howed a &s;ignal for us to drop a&s;tern, we &s;hortened &s;ail and kept only the three top-&s;ails on the caps, under which we &s;ailed as fa&s;t as the Bon-homme Richard under all her &s;ails, and were compelled to make a lee lurch to let her go ahead of us; at half pa&s;t three o'clock, when we might have been along &s;ide, or very nigh the cha&s;e, had Capt. Jones let the Alliance continue the cha&s;e, it grew quite calm; the Bon-homme Richard &s;ent her boats, with others, after the cha&s;e, which was yet above five miles di&s;tance, not knowing what force &s;he might be, and could have took or &s;unk all the boats, being out of our power to &s;upport them at that di&s;tances; be&s;ides on that coa&s;t where fogs are very frequent and &s;udden, it was very dangerous to &s;end the boats thus; but Capt. Jones having I &s;uppo&s;e,
<PB N="28" REF="018549_0028_0FA7AD7CB37D1B48">
heard that my crew had grumbled again&s;t me, for having not had their &s;hares of what had been taken out of the fir&s;t prize, knew by doing the &s;ame again, it would increa&s;e their di&s;content, as it really did; however, the cha&s;e not having a mu&s;ket on board, was taken, and proved to be an Engli&s;h brig loaded with fi&s;h-oil, from Newfoundland to England. But Capt. Jones paid dear with his men for having prevented my going to take her, as will appear hereafter. At noon the Skillocks beared S. E. &frac12; E.</P>
<P>In the afternoon a &s;ignal was hoi&s;ted on board the Bon-homme Richard for all the Captains to go on board of her, which they did: being there, it was reported that there was a London privateer di&s;armed up in Limerick river, but there was always an exci&s;e armed &s;loop, be&s;ides there was an Engli&s;h 50 gun &s;hip lying at anchor in Gallway bay, between the i&s;land and the main, where there was one good and &s;afe pa&s;&s;age to go to. It was moved which of the two was be&s;t to go after; I an&s;wered, that as to go in Limerick river with the Alliance, or &s;end there her boats, it was too dangerous, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the orders I had, con&s;equently I would have no hands in it. As to the 50 gun &s;hip, being on my way to go where I was order|ed, as we were all together more than a match for her, be&s;ides the probability of &s;urpri&s;ing her, or engage her, whil&s;t &s;he laid at anchor, which would have given us great advantage over her, I was willing to join in the undertaking of &s;uch atchievement, as it would deviate but little from the cour&s;e I was to keep to go on my &s;tation. I &s;uppo&s;e it was propo&s;ed only in order to have my refu&s;al, that Capt. Jones might make a charge again&s;t me, &s;aying that by my unwillingne&s;s he mi&s;&s;ed taking a 50 gun &s;hip, and there was no more &s;aid about it.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved to Capt. Jones that he had expo&s;ed his boats in going after a ve&s;&s;el which I might have reached before the calm came on, had he not prevented me by a &s;ignal to do it; he deni|ed that &s;uch &s;ignal had been made, but it was proved it had; and I added that, not being un|der his orders by tho&s;e I had from his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> I joined with him for the good of the &s;ervice, as he told me he was going al&s;o in the North Sea, &amp;c. but if he made me again any &s;uch &s;ignal as he had done in the morning, again&s;t the &s;aid good and &s;uc|ce&s;s of the &s;ervice, I would do what I &s;hould think my duty therefor, without taking notice of the &s;ignals which he might make again&s;t the good of &s;aid &s;ervice. As I was going on board the Alliance, Capt. Jones followed me in the &s;teerage, &s;topped me there, and pointing with his finger at the Alliance, told me, you &s;ee that Frigate, you may thank me for having the com|mand of her &s;till, for I was empowered by Dr. Franklin to take her from you. I &s;uppo&s;e, finding that I was &s;trict to the orders I had from his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and he could not keep me with him to prevent me from executing them, he told me that, in order to lay me under an obligation, thinking, if I believed him, out of gratitude I would do that which he wanted, which was to keep me from doing my mi&s;&s;ion; but in&s;tead of that, I told him I knew better, and that I did not believe him, as I was advi&s;ed in time that he had done all he could to take &s;aid command from me; and moreover, I told him that I believed no more that Dr. Frank|lin had empowered him to take &s;aid command from me, as he had not that power him&s;elf, I left him and went on board the Alliance.</P>
<P>At ten o'clock, P. M. the Bon-homme Richard fired &s;everal guns without &s;howing any &s;ig|nal: at eight o'clock, A. M. we &s;aw the Cerf making all &s;ail towards the land: at ten o'clock the Bon-homme Richard came and &s;poke to me; &s;omebody &s;peaking for Capt. Jones, told me that the evening before, one of their boats with &s;even men in her, had run away towards the land, that they had fitted and &s;ent another with &s;eventeen men after her, which was not come back; I an&s;wered I was &s;orry for it: he a&s;ked me to go on board the Bon-homme Richard; I told him the weather was too foggy to leave my &s;hip <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="018549_0029_0FA7AD7D85E450E8">In the afternoon of the 25th (a&s;tronomick date) I went on board the Bon-homme Richard and a&s;ked Capt. Jones what he wanted of me, gue&s;&s;ing he would try to make me &s;ay the lo&s;s he had made was not by his fault, he told me he had lo&s;t two boats and twenty-four men; I repeated I was very &s;orry for it, and ob&s;erved, if he had let me cha&s;e the preceeding day it would not have happened; he replied he did not let me cha&s;e for fear I would have run too nigh the &s;hore; I proved it could not be the Skillocks which he mentioned bore Ea&s;terly of us, and the cha&s;e bore N. W. at nine or ten miles di&s;tance, having her head at the S. W. In cha&s;ing I would have got further and farther from any part whatever of the land, of which we were already at nine or ten miles di&s;tance: he told me that I wanted to charge him of the lo&s;s of his boats and men, but that they had not run away coming from taken the brig as I really thought; and Lieut. Col. Wirbert, who was there, explained to me that the boats being come back from the prize, and the Bon-homme Richard being in calm, and too nigh the &s;hore, the boats were &s;ent ahead to tow her off; but as &s;oon as it was dark, one of the boats cut off her tow-line and ran off towards the land, whereupon the other boat was fitted ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d &s;ent after her: I &s;aid if I had not been prevented from cha&s;ing, the boats of the Bon-homme Richard would have been kept on board, and during the day they might have towed off the Bon-homme Richard, as I had the Alliance towed by her boats, when they would not have offered to run away; but to the con|trary, the Bon-homme Richard's boats being on board the prize, could not do the &s;ame &s;ervice to their &s;hip in the day time as they would have done, and they took the opportunity of night, knowing that in five minutes time they would be out of &s;ight, as they did; therefore it was the con&s;equence of having prevented me from cha&s;ing the prize which occa&s;ioned the lo&s;s of his men and boats: Capt. Jones, having no rea&s;on to give again&s;t what I &s;aid, told me 'tis a lie; as he &s;poke very low, I told him I hoped I had not well under&s;tood what he had &s;aid, and to repeat it; which he did a &s;econd time and repeated a third, &s;aying 'twas a d&mdash;m lie: I could help my anger no longer, I got up from my &s;eat and told him had he not been on board his own &s;hip I would have puni&s;hed him as he de&s;erved for giving me the lie the fir&s;t time, and I offered to go away; but he took the key of the cabin door which laid upon the &s;tarboard cup|board, and was going to lock the door: I &s;natched the key from his hand as he was putting it into the key-hole; he tried to take it again out of my hand, but I pu&s;hed him off in &s;uch a manner as to intimate to him to go no further; finding he had been too far, and that way would not an&s;wer, he became as mild as a lamb, tried to exculpate him&s;elf, &s;aying that, in lock|ing the door, he pretended only to prevent any body to come in. I told him he had a centry out &s;ide of the door, whom he could have ordered to let no body come in: I told him before Colonel Chamillard and Wirbert, the only two there, that I would have &s;atisfaction of him, for his abu&s;ive language and demeanours to me as &s;oon as arrived; he &s;aid he would give it to me as &s;oon as we might be on &s;hore, any way I plea&s;ed; and I went away telling him, I would not come for the future on board his &s;hip; he made no more oppo&s;ition to my going on board the Alliance.</P>
<P>The Bon-homme Richard kept firing guns, to call back his two boats and the cutter Cerf, which he had &s;ent after the elopement to look out for them, but none ever appeared. On the 26th he came to &s;peak to the Alliance, and told that none their boats nor the Cerf were come back. I had &s;omebody to an&s;wer, nor never would I &s;uppo&s;e, on the contrary, that the de&s;erters were on &s;hore, where they would give the alarm and tell our force, by which they might gather together a &s;tronger one to come again&s;t us; and that it was neither prudent nor &s;afe to remain there any longer: moreover, that if they intended to remain there, to let me know it that I might proceed where I had orders to go&punc; they &s;aid they would &s;tay a day longer only.</P>

<P>All the night the wind blew very fre&s;h, and all &s;hips laid to under main-&s;ail: the next morning the Bon-homme Richard being three miles di&s;tance by the Alliance's weather bow, made her a &s;ignal to go and &s;peak to her, which was impo&s;&s;ible, having then enough of our main-&s;ail, but the Bon-homme Richard could have clewed her own to let the Alliance come up with her, or could have &s;ent the Vengeance to tell her what &s;he wanted: as &s;oon as the wind lulled, I made &s;ail and &s;poke to her; Capt. Jones told me to go and tell the prizes to make more &s;ail, which I accordingly did, though it would have been more proper if he had ordered the &s;ame to the Vengeance, which was a fitter ve&s;&s;el for that purpo&s;e, and had nothing el&s;e to do; but Capt. Jones did it out of &s;pight, to try to put an end to my patience.</P>
<P>On the 2d September, the wind and &s;ea falling, I &s;ent Mr. White, one of the Alliance's Mid&s;hipmen, on board, as ma&s;ter of the prize Union, with &s;imilar orders I had given to Mr. Fitz|gerald for the Bet&s;ey, but I told him if Capt. Jones &s;ent him any, to receive them; we took all the pri&s;oners on board, and manned her properly.</P>
<P>On the 3d in&s;tant, at four o'clock, A. M. &s;aw from the Alliance, a &s;ail bearing N. E. &s;how|ed the &s;ignal therefor to the Bon-homme Richard, who did not an&s;wer it; I ordered to cha&s;e the &s;ail in &s;ight; the Bon-homme Richard &s;howed a &s;ignal to form the line, but did not &s;how by a &s;ignal what line to form; and as I was upon a line with her, I continued the cha&s;e, and &s;oon knew the &s;hip cha&s;ed to be the Pallas, which had been parted from the Bon-homme Richard ever &s;ince the 27th ultimo, when we parted her al&s;o. I went on board the Pallas, and a&s;ked Capt. Cottineau if he could receive &s;ome of the hundred and forty pri&s;oners that were on board the Alliance, where there was no room to &s;ecure them properly: he told me I might &s;end him &s;ome; accordingly I &s;ent him the Union's crew, and kept the others.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, the Bon-homme Richard &s;howed a &s;ignal for all Captains to go on board of her; I &s;ent Mr. Blodget, and de&s;ired him to a&s;k Capt. Jones's order to me in writing, as I could not go to receive them my&s;elf. Capt. Cottineau came him&s;elf to require me to go on board the Bon-homme Richard, and told me 'twas to agree together how to land at Shetland, where Capt. Jones was going; I told him as to go on board the Bon-homme Richard I would never go; that I was not under Capt. Jones's orders was evident, his mi&s;&s;ion being to land as he intended to do, and mine was to cruize by his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, E&s;q'rs orders to me; neverthele&s;s, if he wanted to con&s;ult me upon any plan, he might do it in writing, or &s;end an officer to communicate it to me verbally, and I would give my opinion thereupon; moreover, though I was not under Capt. Jones's orders, if he would &s;end them to me in wri|ting, I would do all I could to execute them&mdash;he went away. Capt. Jones &s;ent me by Mr. Meaze, the following, viz.</P>

<P>On the 3d in&s;tant, at noon, the two prizes were almo&s;t out of &s;ight, on our lee quarter, and the Bon-homme Richard a mile ahead by our weather bow, carrying pre&s;&s;ed &s;ail; in following her, we &s;oon after lo&s;t &s;ight of the prizes.</P>

<P>On the &s;eventh in&s;tant a high N. W. wind drove every one of us from the land, laid to un|der-main &s;ail only; at ten P. M. the Richard windward of the Alliance and the Pallas leeward of her, we lo&s;t &s;ight of every one, &s;howed &s;everal times a light to the mizen-pick, but none an|&s;wered; at day light none in &s;ight of us&mdash;the wind and &s;ea very high, found the Alliance's cut-water had parted from her &s;tem of above an inch; kept the &s;ame tack. On the ninth in&s;t. we had &s;ounding by fifty-three fathoms: and on the eleventh in&s;tant made land north of Scarborough.</P>
<P>On the twelfth in&s;tant at &s;ix o'clock A. M. &s;aw a &s;hip-of-war and a cutter by our weather-bow, they bore down upon us for a &s;hort time, and the Alliance kept always clo&s;e to the wind, but they came clo&s;e to the wind al&s;o; the Alliance cha&s;ed them until night, but could not come up with them. The next day we took a brig, loaded with coal, bound from New-Ca&s;tle to Hamborough; I took her crew on board, manned and &s;ent her to Bergen, in Norway.</P>
<P>The Alliance having cruized ever &s;ince, off Flamborough-head; on the 22d in&s;tant, &s;he &s;aw, at the break of day, a large &s;hip and a brig; &s;he gave cha&s;e to them, and they run away, but &s;he came up with them very fa&s;t, when I knew the &s;hip to be the Pallas: I &s;howed her the Alli|ance's private &s;ignal, and &s;he &s;hewed me hers; the Alliance &s;howed her a &s;ignal to cha&s;e a brig in &s;ight, which &s;he went after, took and &s;cuttled, as well as the other &s;he had with her, when perceived; and the Alliance cha&s;ed another, which got into Burlington harbour, before &s;he could come up with it; being in &s;hoal water, &s;he &s;tood off: at &s;ix o'clock, P. M. &s;poke to the Pallas, who told me they had parted the Bon-homme Richard and Pallas three days before, that they had done nothing but took a &s;mall brig, which the Bon-homme Richard had ran&s;omed, and that the Vengeance had parted them the &s;ame night the Alliance did, but had joined them again two days after.</P>
<P>At 7 o'clock, P. M. on the 22d September (a&s;tronomic reckoning) &s;aw two &s;ails, but &s;o clo&s;e to the land, that we could not give them cha&s;e; at three o'clock, A. M. &s;aw two &s;ails windward of us, one of them appeared to be a large &s;hip, which had lights fore and aft, and fired two guns; we brought to, waiting for them, and prepared for action, but they brought to al&s;o, and &s;tood upon the defen&s;ive; Capt. Cottineau, of the Pallas, a&s;ked me, if the large&s;t proved to be a &s;ixty-four Engli&s;h &s;hip, what I intended to do; I an&s;wered, we mu&s;t in that ca&s;e, try to e&s;cape, and even if &s;he was above fifty, being too &s;hortly manned, I would have nothing to do with her: at day-light, we &s;aw they were the Bon-homme Richard and Vengeance.</P>
<P>About 8 o'clock, A. M. we &s;aw &s;everal &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, clo&s;e to Flamborough-head, which we were cha&s;ing all together, when at ten o'clock, we &s;aw windward, one of the brigs, prize to the Pallas, &s;cuttled and abandoned the day before, which could be ea&s;ily perceived, as &s;he had all her &s;heets and braces loo&s;e, that ve&s;&s;el offing and loffing &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; the Bon-homme Richard cha&s;ed her, and &s;howed a &s;ignal to all the others to follow; about half an hour, P. M. the Bon-homme Richard fitted out a pilot &s;chooner &s;he had taken, to go and take her; but Capt. Jones, in all appearance, forgot to give the officer he &s;ent in her, a &s;ignal to recall her on board the Bon-homme Richard, if he thought proper.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="018549_0035_0FA7AD846AC6CE40">At one o'clock, P. M. &s;aw from the Alliance, two &s;ails, bearing N.

Jones had &s;ent after the brig abandoned. The Alliance and Pallas bore away, &s;at all &s;ails, and &s;teered at fir&s;t N. E. by N. to cut off from the land the two &s;ails cha&s;ed; in cha&s;ing and going from the land, we &s;oon di&s;covered the fleet of Engli&s;h merchantmen clo&s;e to the land, Northerly of Flamborough-head, which had been hidden 'till then from us by &s;aid Cape: at four o'clock the wind &s;hifted to the S. W. one of the two &s;ails cha&s;ed tacked about and went clo&s;e to the wind, upon the larboard tack, towards the fleet; the other, which was the large&s;t, kept upon the &s;tarboard tack; the Bon-homme Richard and Ven|geance, which had been clo&s;e to the wind, or brought to upon the larboard tack 'till then, began to bear away, being five miles a&s;tern of the Alliance, and con&s;equently &s;o much farther from the ve&s;&s;els cha&s;ed; at five o'clock, the large&s;t of the two ve&s;&s;els, &s;eeing the Alliance draw nigh very fa&s;t, &s;howed a &s;ignal to the other, and fired a gun; they both tacked about to join one another the &s;ooner; the Pallas two miles a&s;tern, &s;hortened &s;ail to wait for the Bon-homme Richard; at &s;ix o'clock, the two &s;ails cha&s;ed, had formed a line upon the &s;tarboard tack, clo&s;e to the wind, at half a cable length di&s;tance, brought to under top-&s;ails, the fore one full, the main and mizen ones on the ma&s;t, the large&s;t ahead; the Alliance being then a mile di&s;tance from them, &s;eeing the lower battery ports open of the large&s;t, and both having St. George's flag and pendent flying, the Alliance brought to upon their &s;tarboard quarter, being not half manned, and &s;o inferior in &s;trength to the enemies, waiting for the others to agree with them how to attack, having no &s;ignal during all the cha&s;e; at &s;even o'clock the two Engli&s;h men-of-war having wore and put in a line clo&s;e to the wind upon the larboard tack as they were before upon the other, the Bon-homme Richard coming down at a mile di&s;tance windward of the Alliance, I had her three top-&s;ails filled and went clo&s;e to the wind to &s;peak to Captain Jones, acquaint him of the enemies force, and agree together how to attack them; I had him hailed, but in&s;tead of an&s;wering, the Bon-homme Richard, which was right before the wind, went large upon the larboard tack, to avoid &s;peaking to us; &s;eeing which, the Alliance bore away and went on the weather-quarter of the enemies as they were, having the large&s;t of them at two mu&s;ket's &s;hot di&s;tance by the lee-bow, and the other at the &s;ame di&s;tance by her beam's end, which hailed the Alliance, but was not an&s;wered: the Bon-homme Richard went and brought to, about a mile di&s;tance, by the large&s;t of the enemies bow, where &s;he &s;tay'd above half an hour: the Bon-homme Richard bore head-long upon the large&s;t of the enemies broad-&s;ide, who taking the advantage thereof, raked the Bon-homme Richard &s;ore and aft, from her &s;tarboard bow to her larboard quarter, by which he was &s;o di&s;abled that the men, after having fi|red her upper and lower deck guns, left their quarters, as did tho&s;e upon her poop. At the in&s;tant the fir&s;t gun of the Bon-homme Richard was fired, the Alliance began the engagement with the other enemies &s;hip, which returned broad-&s;ide for broad-&s;ide, during twenty minutes; but finding the Alliance's fire too heavy for her, filled her top&s;ails, and had main and fore-tack on board to go ahead, before &s;he was perceived, in the &s;moke to give way: as &s;oon as perceiv|ed, the Alliance had her top&s;ails filled, and both main and foretacks on board, to join the ene|my's again. The Pallas being on the Alliance's quarter, coming down under top&s;ails, I hail|ed and told her to make more &s;ail and come to engage the &s;malle&s;t of the two enemies, and I would go to help the Bon-homme Richard, who had been &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the enemies broad-&s;ides
<PB N="36" REF="018549_0036_0FA7AD870DB05D30">
that &s;he fired now and then, &s;ome of her quarter deck-guns: Capt. Cottineau de&s;ired me to fire a broad-&s;ide pa&s;&s;ing windward of the &s;hip the Pallas was going to engage, which we did; being &s;oon come up with the Bon-homme Richard, and the enemy &s;he was en|gaged with, we found them fa&s;t along &s;ide, head and &s;tern of one another, the enemy being windward, and having her head towards the north, fired &s;ix or &s;even of her larboard lower bat|tery guns at the Alliance, but the &s;hots went between her ma&s;ts; &s;eeing the po&s;ition of the&s;e two &s;hips, I judged, that if I went along &s;ide of the enemy, that all my cannon and &s;mall-arm &s;hots would go on board the Bon-homme Richard, and hers come on board the Alliance, by which we mu&s;t have de&s;troyed one another, and the enemy would have the advantage to play her two &s;ide batteries upon us; therefore I thought the be&s;t and only way to reduce the enemy was to rake her from &s;tern to head; accordingly the Alliance bore away, I called the Lieutenants and Ma&s;ter-Gunners, &s;howed them the enemy, which had her &s;tern towards us, and recommended them to tell the Gunners, to point upon a light &s;he had in her cabin, and told them to take care not to fire upon the Bon-homme Richard, who had her head towards us; we cro&s;&s;ed a&s;tern of the enemy, within a mu&s;ket &s;hot, and all the guns were fired at her one by one, as we went along; at &s;ame time, our tops fired at her, and upon her quarter-deck; &s;he returned only a few mu&s;ket &s;hots at us (one of which went through a man's hat brim, who was upon the foreca&s;tle, without hurting him: I mention this only to prove the impo&s;ition of Capt. Jones, in his relation about the di&s;tance) the Alliance's broad&s;ide had made &s;uch havock on board the enemy's &s;hip, that though before &s;he fired twenty cannon to the Bon-homme Richard's one, &s;he was reduced to the &s;ame level, they both fired but now and then: the Alliance being then right before the wind, and in the impo&s;&s;i|bility of coming again in any po&s;ition to fire upon the enemy's &s;hip, without running two tacks; having the Pallas and Engli&s;h &s;malle&s;t Frigate engaged together, our &s;tarboard bow at two cables length di&s;tance, I thought the be&s;t &s;ervice I could do, for fear that &s;aid Engli&s;h Frigate, by &s;ome ac|cident or other, might conquer the Pallas, by which the enemies would have been three &s;hips again&s;t two of us; but if I could, by a broad&s;ide, make this Engli&s;h Frigate &s;trike, we &s;hould be four again&s;t one, by which we would be &s;ure of the victory, which manoeuvre could not keep the Alliance above a quarter of an hour from helping the Bon-homme Richard; accordingly, the Alliance went in order to rake the Engli&s;h Frigate, but &s;he &s;eeing the danger thereof, had &s;he &s;tood ten minutes longer, &s;truck her colours; &s;eeing which, the Alliance went clo&s;e to the wind, with main and fore tack on board, on the larboard tack, the current going to the S.

<P>The Alliance took in tow the Serapis, and drew her from the land; very foggy weather, and very weak &s;outh wind; at nine o'clock, A.

At ten o'clock, the Bon-homme Richard coming right upon the Alliance, &s;he was compelled to pre|vent being boarded, to let go the haw&s;er &s;he towed the Serapis by. Then Capt. Jones left the Bon-homme Richard, and went on board the Serapis.</P>
<P>On the 24th in&s;tant, at &s;ix o'clock, A. M. I heard with pain, that Capt. Jones, who had left the Bon-homme Richard the day before, and was gone on board the Serapis, &s;ent me word, to take out of her the wounded people, the only ones left there, and to abandon her; when I knew &s;he could have been &s;aved had he been willing, as the &s;ea had been very &s;mooth the day before, during which &s;he might have been heeled from one &s;ide to the other, and the &s;hot holes at her water line, mended by thirty Carpenters and Calkers, with the nece&s;&s;ary &s;tuffs we had on board the &s;everal &s;hips; and even at eleven o'clock, when we abandoned her, though the&s;e holes were only pluged up, and &s;he had not been pumped &s;ince &s;even o'clock the preceeding evening, and had her lower battery ports open in a high &s;ea to let in the water, &s;he was not &s;ix inches deeper in the water than when &s;he came out of port l'Orient.</P>
<P>But Capt. Jones being &s;en&s;ible that his faults during the engagement, were too deeply printed by the enemies &s;hot upon his &s;hip's &s;ides and head to be erazed, and be&s;ides that, &s;he being a great deal larger and &s;tronger &s;hip than the Serapis, in&s;tead of fal&s;e glory he aimed at by his mi&s;re|pre&s;ented relation, he mu&s;t have been blamed by every body, who might have &s;een and compared the difference of &s;ize and &s;trength of the&s;e two &s;hips, and how little the Serapis had &s;uffered from the Bon-homme Richard; how much the latter had &s;uffered from the former, owing to
<PB N="45" REF="018549_0045_0FA7AD933456B650">
the difference of ability in the two Captains of them, had the Bon-homme Richard been brought into harbour; moreover, by the direction of the &s;hot holes he had received, it might have been judged who &s;he had received them from, all which would have been proofs of the fal&s;hood of the pompous relation he gave of his boa&s;ted glory and ability.</P>
<P>At nine o'clock, A. M. the Serapis, Counte&s;s of Scarborough, Pallas and Vengeance made &s;ail and left the Alliance, taking out of the Bon-homme Richard twenty wounded men left there: but at eleven o'clock, the&s;e &s;hips being about &s;ix miles, Captain Jones imagining and fearing I &s;uppo&s;e that the Alliance would undertake to &s;ave the Bon-homme Richard (which was impo&s;&s;ible, as &s;he had only a hundred and fifteen men in all her crew on board) &s;ent the &s;chooner on board of her, to cut all the main-ma&s;t &s;hrowd's lanyard, by which it went overboard, and unplug'd the &s;hot holes to make her &s;ink, and &s;he accordingly &s;unk at noon.</P>

Jones was in the hou&s;e, I told Mr. de Neuville I wanted to &s;peak to him, he told me he was at the Hague; he did not appear in public for two days: at la&s;t I learned that he was to dine at the Crown, a tavern: being with &s;omebody in a room whence he could have &s;een me come into the hou&s;e, I &s;ent him word three times that I wanted to &s;peak to him before he came; at la&s;t being come, I told him that he remembered how he had in&s;ulted me on board his &s;hip, and had promi&s;ed to give me &s;atisfaction therefor when we &s;hould be on &s;hore, that I was accordingly come to reque&s;t it of him: but as his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> had wrote to Mr. Damas to tell the Captains that, whil&s;t in Holland, there &s;hould be no vari|ance, or &s;omething to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, we might in a few hours go out of Holland where we might accompli&s;h his promi&s;e and my de&s;ire; he denied knowing any thing about &s;aid letter to Mr. Dumas, and added that he would give me no &s;atisfaction, but Dr. Franklin would, whom he had wrote to that I had fired upon the Bon-homme Richard during the engagement, and killed many of his men; I replied I knew him well enough not to wonder at his forging &s;uch fal&s;hood, in order to avoid giving me the &s;atisfaction I reque&s;ted of him, and to charge, if

he could, the Alliance with the blood of above &s;ixty men he had lo&s;t by his blunders and mi&s;|conduct in attacking the Serapis, to whom he mu&s;t have &s;urrendered in three-quarters of an hour's engagement, had not the Alliance re&s;cued him, de&s;troyed and made the Serapis yield: &s;eeing that I grew warm he &s;uddenly withdrew, and went again in the room he came from. Knowing all he was capable of, and fearing that he would tell barely that I was come to cha|lenge him, in order to find a charge again&s;t me; I went in the room and a&s;ked him if he had any orders to &s;end on board the Serapis; he &s;aid no, and I went away.</P>

<P>"I received the letter you did me the honor of writing to me, the fourth in&s;tant, with an ab&s;tract of your journal; I thank you for your care in &s;ending it &s;o early; and I congratulate you on the &s;uc|ce&s;s of your cruize.</P>

A Court-Martial is the regular way, if you choo&s;e it, but as that may occa&s;ion a long di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and be in many re&s;pects, at this time, inconvenient to the &s;ervice, I have (with the advice of your friend Mon&s;ieur de Chaumont) thought it better to give you an opportunity of ju&s;tifying your&s;elf both to the Mini&s;try and to me, by coming directly to Paris, which I do hereby accordingly de&s;ire (or to u&s;e a &s;tronger expre&s;&s;ion, as you may think &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary to ju&s;ti|fy your leaving your &s;hip, I do require) that you render your&s;elf here as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.

<P>I thought I perceived, by his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> he wanted to give a dou|ble interpretation to his orders to me, &s;aying that there was charges again&s;t me for di&s;obedience of orders, though there was nothing in them that directed me to obey Capt. Jones; and by the French Mini&s;ter's interfering in the matter of the engagement&punc; that there was a plan laid again&s;t me before I left l'Orient, and Capt. Jones had been directed to take advantage of events to carry it on as he did, being &s;ure to be backed by his Excellency Benjamin Eranklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who, he had owned to me and others, had empowered him when at l'Orient, to take the command of the Alliance from me.</P>
<P>For what would have become of Capt. Jones's pretended glory, and how could he have bro't any charge again&s;t me had he owned,&mdash;that the Alliance, out of &s;even merchant ve&s;&s;els which were taken, &s;he alone took five of them, and &s;he was in company with the others when the two other &s;mall ones were taken,&mdash;his conduct and blunders in general during all the time the Al|liance had been in company with the others,&mdash;and in particular in the time of the cha&s;e and en|gagement
<PB N="48" REF="018549_0048_0FA7AD956DCBB588">
of the 23d September, 1779,&mdash;that he began in the Bon-homme Richard to cha&s;e but two hours after the Alliance and Pallas did, he running or bringing too clo&s;e to the wind for his pilot &s;chooner, by which he mi&s;&s;ed the opportunity of engaging, as he could have done, with the Alliance and Pallas, the enemies during day time, when he might have better &s;een the enemies po&s;ition and force,&mdash;that during the cha&s;e he made no &s;ignal whatever to be per|ceived by the Alliance, and when &s;he went to &s;peak to him he avoided her, thinking the enemies much inferior than they were, and that he could reduce them by giving them each a broad-&s;ide, without the help of the Alliance,&mdash;that he took the wor&s;t po&s;ition to attack the enemies, going on the bow of the headmo&s;t of them, though he &s;aw the Alliance placed on their quarter, which was the be&s;t one to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the engagement in,&mdash;that he bore his &s;hip head-long upon the ene|mies broad&s;ide, which took advantage of his blunder, raked him in &s;uch a manner that his &s;hip was di&s;abled and di&s;ordered, the crew much le&s;&s;ened, and the remnant left their quarter in a &s;hort time, without having done any damage to the enemy, not having been in a po&s;ition to fire at him,&mdash;that the Alliance began at &s;ame time he did, to engage the Counte&s;s of Scarborough (where, had &s;he remained all the engagement long, &s;he could not have been cen&s;ured therefor, as no &s;ignal was made to the contrary, not even to engage) for twenty minutes with &s;uch ad|vantage, that the latter to avoid the continuation thereof, by the &s;moke unperceived, filled her &s;ails and got ahead, that the Alliance &s;eeing it, filled hers, had main and foretack on board, leaving the Pallas, which was two dull &s;ailing &s;hip to get ahead, to engage the Counte&s;s of Scarborough, and went, &s;eeing it immediate nece&s;&s;ity, to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Capt. Jones, who mu&s;t have been in that moment ab&s;ent, &s;ince he did not make a &s;ignal for it,&mdash;that by the only ad|vantageous manoeuvre, by which the Alliance raked the Serapis the fir&s;t time, &s;he was almo&s;t as di&s;abled as the Bon-homme Richard, and mu&s;t have lo&s;t many of her men,&mdash;that the Alli|ance, in the po&s;ition &s;he was then in, could no better manoeuvre, to in&s;ure the victory again&s;t the common enemies, than to make the Counte&s;s of Scarborough &s;trike as &s;he did,&mdash;that the Alliance went after as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, and raked from head to &s;tern the Serapis a &s;econd time, &mdash;that with the &s;ame diligence &s;he ran a tack and went to rake &s;o effectually the Serapis a third time, that &s;he &s;truck, by which Capt. Jones was delivered from the inevitable &s;ad fate he could expect in falling in the Engli&s;h hands, &mdash;that after all this, Capt. Jones, to an&s;wer his purpo&s;e, had the Bon-homme Richard &s;unk, becau&s;e, had &s;he been brought in, it would have been a palpable witne&s;s again&s;t him. Had Capt. Jones owned all tho&s;e truths, he would have been de&s;pi&s;ed for his ignorance, and called to an account for his conduct and confu&s;ion in all tho&s;e ca&s;es (not to &s;ay wor&s;e) during the action, by which he had &s;o many mens' lives lo&s;t, and mu&s;t have lo&s;t more &s;till in the action and his &s;hip, had not the Alliance, by her &s;uperior manoeuvre, in taking all po&s;&s;ible advantage over the enemies po&s;ition, re&s;cued him by reducing them, as &s;he did without lo&s;ing a man: but Capt. Jones was wonted, when guilty, to lay his faults on others, invented all to clear him&s;elf and charge me, knowing he was in the &s;ecret of the con|cerned, which mu&s;t have paid for the Bon-homme Richard had &s;he been proved to have been lo&s;t by his faults, therefore he knew, had they had no previous de&s;igns again&s;t me, they would, to &s;ave their money, &s;upport him with all their power and influence.</P>
<P>However, thinking that his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> would have charged me with di&s;obedience of his orders had I not gone, as ordered, to Paris; and his Excellency and Mr. de Sartine the French Mini&s;ter, would have made it appear in the world, that I was really guilty, &s;ince I would not go there to ju&s;tify my&s;elf: and on the other hand, being con&s;cious of my dutifulne&s;s in all re&s;pects, and per&s;uaded that I mu&s;t not only be ju&s;tified, but applauded for my conduct; not con&s;idering enough that it is not &s;ufficient to be innocent and dutiful therefor,
<PB N="49" REF="018549_0049_0FA7AD97EBEBAAE8">
but there is another condition of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, which is the impartiality in the judges, which I could have no rea&s;ons to expect; prefering even to be a victim, rather than to appear guilty, I determined to go, and in con&s;equence had the undeniable certificate of my conduct by all the officers, &s;ome my known enemies, all Americans, to whom I repeatedly told not to &s;ign any thing but that they were certain of. I ordered, by a written order to the Fir&s;t-Lieutenant, to keep the command of the Alliance during my ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>I went to the Helder, where I tarried three days, to have from Capt. Cottineau a certificate of my an&s;wers to him, when he came to tell me to go on board the Bon-homme Richard; but Capt. Cottineau being &s;o &s;ick that his life was de&s;paired of, could not give it to me then. Du|ring the time I was there, Capt. Spencer, who had been volunteer on board the Alliance du|ring the la&s;t cruize, brought me word that Capt. Jones appeared to u&s;e his u&s;ual tricks in bringing every one he could to &s;ign a pack of his forged charges again&s;t me; that he told the officers he had wrote to Paris, and &s;ilver-handle &s;words would be &s;ent for them. He made &s;ome of his Mid&s;hipmen Aid-de-camps on board his &s;hip; promi&s;ed that he was going to &s;ell the Se|rapis and Counte&s;s of Scarborough to let them have money, &amp;c. &amp;c. Finally, he promi&s;ed pro|motion at random, even gave a commi&s;&s;ion and the command in chief of the Alliance to the Fir&s;t-Lieutenant Mr. Degge (whom I had given my la&s;t order to) as follows, viz.</P>

<P>Whil&s;t I was in Am&s;terdam, it would have been ea&s;y for me to over&s;et Capt.

<P>I arrived at Paris November 8th, and went directly at Pa&s;&s;y to &s;ee his Excellency Benjamin Franklin <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and told him I was ready to an&s;wer all charges laid again&s;t me: he not ex|pecting me was &s;urpri&s;ed, unprepared, and knew not what to an&s;wer, at la&s;t he told me he had yet no charges again&s;t me, but he expected them &s;oon (by which an&s;wer it appeared that he had commended Captain Jones to make charges again&s;t me, or Captain Jones mu&s;t have wrote to him, that he met with difficulties to make any, or to bring people to &s;ign them) I told him I was a&s;toni&s;hed, that he had ordered me to leave the command of the Alliance in a foreign country, and make me come from Holland to Paris, before he had any charges again&s;t me, he replied they would come, and not knowing what to &s;ay, he added, I have only Captain Jones's relation: I a&s;ked him whether he had not received al&s;o the relation, &s;ketch, &amp;c. of the battle I had &s;ent him, he &s;aid he had: he told me he had wrote me to come only by the French Mi|ni&s;ter's de&s;ire, and I had better go and &s;ee him; I a&s;ked him what I had to do with the French Mini&s;ter, and whether he was al&s;o the United States' Mini&s;ter; he giving me no an&s;wer, I told him though I was an&s;werable to nobody but him&s;elf, &s;ince he directed me to go to the French Mini&s;ter, I would go.</P>

me to come and &s;ee him, in con&s;equence thereof, I was come directly, and waiting for admittance to hear what he had to tell me: Mr. de Sartine &s;ent me word that he was very bu&s;y for the pre&s;ent moment, but would write me as &s;oon as he could, when to come.&mdash;He has never done it.</P>
<P>Next Monday after I went to Pa&s;&s;y, to enquire whether his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> had received the &s;aid charges, he &s;aid he had not, but his grand&s;on coming in the next in&s;tant after, having not heard his grandfather's an&s;wer, hearing me mention charges, &s;aid that &s;ome were in his office; the grandfather rebuked him and &s;aid it was not tho&s;e; upon which I &s;aid it was very &s;trange, after having been ordered, as I was, to come to an&s;wer charges laid again&s;t me, when arrived, there was none; and after they were come, though I was upon the place ready to an&s;wer them, they were kept from me, and I was told there was none, which looked as if his Excellency wanted to keep me from the Alliance: he gave me a written order to remain in Paris, and told me to come again the next Monday.</P>
<P>Being there, I found a&s;&s;embled with his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Doctor Pengraff, (one of his Excellency's &s;ecretary) and Mr. Le Ray de Chaumont; his Excellency told me verbally there were the four following charges again&s;t me, viz.</P>

<P>Fourth, For having not taken the fleet the next day after the engagement.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved to his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> that there was no body competent judges of tho&s;e charges, as the fir&s;t one depended whether I had obeyed his orders literally; and the three others required &s;ea-officers to under&s;tand the nature of the ca&s;e, and judge whether I had done, or not, all that could be done in the&s;e ca&s;es, for the be&s;t; however, that for his &s;atisfaction I was going to an&s;wer every one of them.</P>
<P>To an&s;wer the fir&s;t article I &s;howed the order to me of his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> dated April, 28th, 1779, by which, "<HI>He ordered me to put my &s;hip and my&s;elf under Capt.

Jones's order, he being on board the Bon-homme Richard, and obeyed him until my own and his return to France, in Port l'Orient, where by the purport of &s;aid order ended his command over my &s;hip and me: his Excellency replied it could not be called a cruize out of France, becau&s;e we had cruized then only in the Bay of Bi&s;cay, which was called the French &s;ea; I told him he might give what interpretation he plea&s;ed, but there were Engli&s;h men-of-war and privateers to cruize for, as well as in the channel, and that in his order he had not mentioned any particular place to cruize in, I could not know whether he intended, or not, any other cruize at that time, and therefore having cruized there under Capt. Jone's order, where he laid me, I had fulfilled li|terally the contents of his Excellency's order: his Excellency in&s;i&s;ted by &s;imilar rea&s;ons, that that cruize was no real cruize; I told him it appeared he was determined to find me guilty, even again&s;t his own hand writing proofs to the contrary, and that all which had pa&s;&s;ed, and that I had heard, convinced me of what Capt. Jones had told me, on the 25th September 1779, that his Excellency had given had power to take the command of the Alliance from me, when at l'Orient: and he had not told it to me only, as will appear by the following certificate, viz.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>His Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> denied the fact, and that Capt. Jones could not have &s;aid any &s;uch thing, and that I wanted to reflect upon him; to put an end to that charge, I &s;howed his Excellency's order to me, dated "Pa&s;&s;y, July 28th, 1780," in which there was no|thing mentioned that I was, or &s;hould be, in any ca&s;e, under Capt. Jones's orders, but it was &s;aid, "<HI>But in ca&s;e the Bon-homme Richard was not ready to &s;ail with you, what Mr. de Chaumont will inform you, then go to cruize in the North Seas, by &s;uch route you will judge proper for intercepting the Northen trade to England, &amp;c.</HI>" as I have before mentioned &s;peaking of my departure from l'Orient. That according to his orders, I had applied to Mr. de Chaumont, and enquired whether the Bon-homme Richard would be ready to &s;ail with the Alliance, that he had given me &s;uch an|&s;wer, as is certified by him heretofore (which he repeated before his Excellency) that I had told him I was not under Capt. Jones's orders, by tho&s;e he had brought me from his Excellency; that Mr. de Chaumont had directed me to a&s;k Capt. Jones a copy of his Excellency's orders to him relative to the Alliance or me; that he had given me thereof an extract, which I produced to his Excellency (of which a copy is heretofore) wherein the Alliance's or my name is not mentioned; that I then told Capt. Jones I was not under his orders, by tho&s;e I had from his Excellency, to which he &s;aid not a word.</P>
<P>That I &s;ailed out of port l'Orient to Groais alone, not knowing when the Bon-homme Rich|ard could be ready for &s;ea, if ever &s;he was; that he came there after, where Capt. Jones told me he was going likewi&s;e, in the North-Sea, where Commodore John&s;tone was cruizing, and &s;aid we had better go together, which I agreed to, thinking it for the good of the &s;ervice, and not derogatory to his Excellency's order to me; that in con&s;equence the la&s;t rendezvous for the cruize was agreed and given to be off Flamborough-head, and a concordat drawn and &s;igned in ca&s;e of taking any prizes whil&s;t in company together (new proof I was not under Capt. Jones's orders, as he knew there was no need thereof had I been &s;o.) But being off the coa&s;t of Ireland, where it was propo&s;ed to go or &s;end in Limorick river; and upon which coa&s;t we re|mained &s;even days. I told him, I not being under his orders, if he intended to tarry or land there, I would go alone to cruize, as ordered by his Excellency; that Capt. Jones then pre|tended his Excellency's orders to me were of no force, and that I was directly under his immedi|ate orders, though he never offered to ju&s;tify it by giving me a copy of any order he might have had from his Excellency for that cruize concerning the Alliance or me, and even would never give me written orders therefor, though I demanded them &s;everal times, as I had a right to, and could not remain under his orders when they were contrary to tho&s;e I had from his Ex|cellency (he knew better than to give me written orders to follow him in his intended landing, &amp;c. as he had no right to do it) therefore, being parted after, by &s;tre&s;s of weather in con&s;e|quence of his Excellency's order to me, the Alliance had cruized and done alone far more harm to the Engli&s;h trade than all the &s;hips with Capt. Jones together, and I had fulfilled literally his Excellency's orders to me for that cruize.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="018549_0054_0FA7AD9C51A81C70">His Excellency in&s;i&s;ted I was under Capt. Jones's orders by his to me, and even as being my &s;enior officer: I related that (which I have mentioned heretofore) of the Captain of the Continental Frigate called the Queen of France, who was condemned, &s;u&s;pended, and his com|mand took from him for having followed his &s;enior officer, in the Frigate Warren, in Bo&s;ton, as an in&s;tance how a Captain was liable to &s;uffer when he broke &s;uperior orders to follow any &s;e|nior officer's to the contrary: I added there was another proof in his Excellency's orders to me that I was not under Capt. Jones's, becau&s;e he intended to land at Shetland and other places, did never cruize, and met only accidentally the Baltic fleet off Flamborough-head (where the Alliance had been cruizing three weeks) as he came there but the very &s;ame day that we &s;aw and engaged them, &amp;c. having been all the while to try to land upon the coa&s;t of Scotland, without effect: and that in the orders from his Excellency to me, it was expre&s;&s;ed that I was to cruize in the North Sea, for intercepting the Northern trade to England, which proved tho&s;e orders to me quite different from tho&s;e of Capt. Jones. His Excellency replied, that the word cruizing implied as well landing as remaining at &s;ea; I told him I never under&s;tood it &s;o, but it was cro&s;&s;ing to and fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in a &s;tation given: he maintained it was not. I begged to have a Dictionary, which was at la&s;t procured me, wherein I found and &s;howed his Excellency the word cruize was explained much like what I had &s;aid: his Excellency &s;aid it was a mi&s;take of the Printer. What can officers do who is &s;ubject to receive orders from a &s;uperior, who, out of par|tiality, u&s;es &s;uch &s;ubterfuges to find him guilty? I could not help telling him that it was not my fault if there was &s;uch mi&s;take in the Dictionary, and if he had fully explained his inten|tion, I would have done my utmo&s;t to fulfil it; and I made this ob&s;ervation&mdash;&s;uppo&s;ing that your Excellency had died, and in the mean time, in following Capt. Jones, in landing without a pilot, I had, by accident, lo&s;t the Frigate Alliance on a rock, &amp;c. and begged his Excellency to &s;how me, in his orders to me, a word which would have ju&s;tified me before Congre&s;s for lo&s;ing their Frigate in following Capt. Jones: his Excellency knowing he could find none, &s;aid not a word. If I had followed Capt. Jones, as he wanted me, it would have been ea&s;ier for his Excellency to prove I had broke his orders in following him.</P>
<P>Having proved obviou&s;ly I was not under Captain Jones's orders, and had fulfilled his Excel|lency's to me, I proceeded to the &s;econd charge again&s;t me viz. "<HI>Of having fired upon the Bon-homme Richard on the</HI> 23<HI>d September,</HI> 1779." By &s;hewing his Excellency the &s;ketch, relati|on, and certificates of that engagement, &s;igned by all the officers of the Alliance, which he could not &s;u&s;pect to have &s;igned it in my favour, knowing they had been at variance with their Captain ever &s;ince the beginning of the voyage; I explained all the po&s;itions, evolutions and motions of every &s;hip, and all the faults of Capt. Jones, as I have done heretofore in giving the &s;ketch, &amp;c. His Excellency, who had li&s;tened attentively, all the while, &s;aid after I had ended, I might through mi&s;take, have fired upon the Bon-homme Richard; I an&s;wered, admit|ing that for a moment, it would not be a guilt in me, but only a mi&s;take, which might have happened in the night: &s;ince it happened even in day time in Admiral Keppel's fleet, when engaged again&s;t Admiral Count D'orviller's, and nothing was &s;aid about it more than that it was a mi&s;take. But it was not the ca&s;e in our engagement, as I &s;howed him, a &s;econd time, by the officers certificate, where it is &s;aid, "<HI>As there could be no mi&s;take made, &s;eeing the colours of the &s;hips, &amp;c.</HI>"&mdash;But Capt. Jones charged me with it to cover his compounded faults and blunders, by which he had lo&s;t &s;o many men, which he could not account for; and in that ca&s;e as all others, to extricate him&s;elf, he wanted to charge me with their blood. I went further, &s;aying, if I had been black minded enough to have Capt. Jones, his &s;hip and crew de&s;troyed, I had only to &s;tay a&s;tern in my &s;tation with the Counte&s;s of Scarborough, the enemy would &s;oon
<PB N="55" REF="018549_0055_0FA7AD9CF348D478">
have accompli&s;hed it, and no body could have blamed me, as I would have been in my &s;tation: moreover, if by a refined treachery, and blackne&s;s of mind, which can never be imagined, but by tho&s;e who are capable of perpetrating &s;uch a deed, I had been willing to de&s;troy Captain Jones, &amp;c. as hinted by him: as I did not my&s;elf fire a cannon, I mu&s;t have told the officers of my black de&s;ign, which would not have failed to take the command from me and put me in irons therefor; but &s;uppo&s;ing further, I had &s;educed or bribed the officers to have done it, would the Gunners and all the crew have obeyed them in firing upon their American brothers on board the Bon-homme Richard? His Excellency &s;aid it was not likely; then &s;aid I, &s;ince Capt. Jones is capable of devi&s;ing &s;uch charge again&s;t me, to ju&s;tify him&s;elf and appear mighty and glorious, after having been relea&s;ed by the Alliance from the &s;ad fate he was &s;o nigh falling into, it may be imagined what he is capable of.</P>
<P>I proceeded to the third charge again&s;t me, "<HI>Of not having a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Bon-homme Richard as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</HI>" I &s;aid, &s;uppo&s;ing that the Alliance had remained all the engagement long, in her &s;tation, without giving any a&s;&s;i&s;tance whatever to the Bon-homme Richard, &s;he could not have been blamed therefor, having done that duty of hers, as no &s;ignal for preparing engaging the enemies, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Bon-homme Richard, were &s;een from the Alliance: but in&s;tead of that, having been fir&s;t to take her &s;tation on the weather-quarter, at two mu&s;kets &s;hot di&s;tance from the enemies &s;hips, &s;he began to engage with the &s;tern-mo&s;t of them, at the &s;ame time the Bon-homme Richard and Serapis began together; and as &s;oon as the Pallas was come down, &s;he left her, being a dull &s;ailing &s;hip in a light wind, to engage the Counte&s;s of Scarborough; and &s;he, the Alliance, went with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed, to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Bon-homme Richard, which by her bad conduct in the attack, had been almo&s;t totally de&s;troyed; and the Alliance, without any &s;ignal being made, by her good manoeuvres, during the whole engagement, reduced both the enemies &s;hips to &s;urrender, as is proved by the &s;ketch, relation, and certificate of all the officers of the Alliance, by which &s;he did not only her &s;imple duty, but all that could be done; all which coroborates with the two Engli&s;h Captains letter to the Engli&s;h Admiralty (to be found in the Engli&s;h Magazine, for October, 1779) in that one of Capt. Richard Pear&s;on of the Serapis, it is &s;aid, "<HI>At the &s;ame time the large&s;t of the two Frigates</HI>" (which he &s;ays after was the Alliance) "<HI>kept &s;ailing round us the whole action and raking us fore and aft, by which means &s;he killed or wounded almo&s;t every man on the quarter and main decks.&mdash;When the Frigate coming acro&s;s our &s;tern, and pouring her broad-&s;ide into us again, without our being able to bring a gun to bear upon her, I found it in vain, and in &s;hort, impracticable, from the &s;ituation we were in, to &s;tand out any longer with the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s; I therefore &s;truck.</HI>"&mdash;By which it appears, that that Captain owns the Alliance killed and wounded almo&s;t every man on his main and quarter decks, and at half pa&s;t ten, the &s;aid Frigate came acro&s;s his &s;hip's &s;tern and poured her broad-&s;ide into it, without his being able to bring a gun to bear upon her, which is a full apology of the Alliance's conduct, as &s;he not only de&s;troyed all tho&s;e which were de&s;troyed, but conducted it in &s;uch manner that the Serapis could not hurt her, and the Serapis could &s;tand it no longer, and therefore &s;truck.&mdash;Captain Thomas Piercy, of the Counte&s;s of Scarborough, in his let|ter to Captain Pear&s;on, &s;ays, "<HI>About two minutes after you began to engage with the large&s;t of the enemy's &s;quadron, I received a broad-&s;ide from one of the Frigates, which I in&s;tantly returned, and continued engaging her for about twenty minutes, when &s;he dropt a&s;tern;</HI>" which Frigate could be no other than the Alliance, as the Pallas came down after,&mdash;"<HI>And another Frigate coming on my larboard quarter. In that &s;ituation I &s;aw it was in vain to contend any longer, with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t &s;uch &s;uperior force, I &s;truck to the Pallas.</HI>"&mdash;Being engaged with the Pallas, it could be no other than the Alliance, after having raked the Serapis, who coming upon the lar|board
<PB N="56" REF="018549_0056_0FA7AD9DF267D2E8">
quarter of the Counte&s;s of Scarborough to rake her, made her &s;trike to the Pallas &s;he was engaged with, therefore the Alliance made no motion whatever during that action. But great advantage to her party was reaped by it.&mdash;But if the Alliance had bore head-long upon the Counte&s;s of Scarborough's broad-&s;ide, &s;he would have been &s;erved by her, as the Bon-homme Richard had been by the Serapis; but thinking her duty was to de&s;troy the enemies as much as &s;he could, with as little lo&s;s as po&s;&s;ible, &s;he in con&s;equence thereof, took &s;o well the advantage of every po&s;ition, that &s;he contributed in a great degree, to the &s;ucce&s;s of the battle, without having a &s;ingle man killed, which conduct Capt. Jones wanted to make appear to his advan|tage, becau&s;e &s;he had been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>His Excellency &s;aying nothing, I proceeded to an&s;wer the fourth charge again&s;t me, "<HI>Why I had not gone and take the fleet the next day after the engagement,</HI>" &s;aying that when I &s;ailed from l'Orient, the whole crew of the Alliance was compo&s;ed only of two hundred and twenty men in all, out of which the Alliance had manned five prizes &s;he had taken. That as &s;oon as the Serapis had been abandoned, going towards the &s;hore, Capt. Jones &s;ent word to the Alliance to go and take the pri&s;oners out of the Serapis, which &s;he did, and took her in tow to draw her from the land, and put forty of her men on board; that the weather being very foggy when &s;he &s;aw the other &s;hips, the Bon-homme Richard &s;howed a &s;ignal to &s;end to that &s;hip both her men and people, that the Alliance &s;ent all her boats and all the men &s;he could &s;pare, keeping not above &s;ixty men of her crew on board, although &s;he had two hundred and twenty-five pri&s;oners to guard; that the fleet was out of &s;ight, con&s;equently &s;he was not in a &s;ituation, without boat, and with &s;o few hands, to go in &s;earch of them; be&s;ide, Capt. Jones never made a &s;ignal therefor to the Alliance, nor to the other, though they were more able, the Vengeance having her whole crew to do it; therefore the Alliance was in the impo&s;&s;ibility of doing better in this ca&s;e, as well as in all others.</P>
<P>I told his Excellency that out of complai&s;ance I had enumerated all the motions of the dif|ferent &s;hips to him, but as he was not, perhaps, conver&s;ant with the nautick tactick, as he had the copy of the &s;ketch, relation, and certificate of the officers of the Alliance, he might carry it to Ver&s;ailles and a&s;k Mr. de Sartine to have a number of &s;ea-officers (as there were no Ame|ricans to be had) to examine it, and if they &s;aid the Alliance had not done during that en|gagement all &s;he could do, I would look upon my&s;elf as condemned, knowing the French offi|cers were men of honor who would not condemn me unle&s;s they found &s;ome fault in my conduct: his Excellency expecting, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ome fault or other might be found in it, accepted the pro|po&s;al, and it might have been examined for all I know, but &s;ome time after (as he always found &s;ome eva&s;ion for prolonging the time, before I could have made my defence, by giving time to Capt. Jones to &s;ail in the Alliance; one week he had the gout, another he was indi&s;po&s;ed, others he was very bu&s;y, &amp;c.) his Excellency told me he had carried the &s;aid &s;ketch, relation, &amp;c. to Ver&s;ailles, and had a&s;ked the French Mini&s;ter, Mr. de Sartine, to have it examined by &s;ome French &s;ea-officers, but he had refu&s;ed to have it done.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t ob&s;erve here by the bye, that it appeared to me very &s;urpri&s;ing that Mr. de Sartine, who earne&s;tly wrote to his Excellency to have me brought to an account for my conduct during &s;aid engagement, would refu&s;e to have the proper voucher thereof examined. It increa&s;ed in me the following &s;u&s;picions which were, that Mr. de Sartine who was the cau&s;e of my leaving the French &s;ervice, was apprehen&s;ive (my character being well e&s;tabli&s;hed, as may appear even in a London magazine, December 1779. <HI>In the ju&s;tifying memorial of the K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Great-Britain, page</HI> 588, <HI>where it is &s;aid, the &s;hip Heureux (called after Flamond) &s;ailed from Mar&s;eilles, the</HI> 26<HI>th of September, &amp;c. this &s;hip is commanded by Mr. Lundi (in&s;tead of Landais) a French offi|cer

<P>Having received advice from Am&s;terdam, which was confirmed by Mr. de Chaumont, that Capt.

<P>"We the officers, &amp;c. &amp;c. of the American &s;quadron, now at the Texel, this <HI>30</HI>th day of Oc|tober, <HI>1779,</HI> do atte&s;t and declare on our word of honor, that all the following articles which we &s;ub&s;cribe, re&s;pecting the conduct of Peter Landais, Captain of the American Frigate Alliance, are really and truly matters of fact, in witne&s;s whereof, we hereunto &s;ign our names and qualities, and will at any time hereafter, be ready to prove the &s;ame upon oath, if required.</P>
<P>"Article <HI>1</HI>&s;t. The Captain of the Alliance did not take the &s;teps in his power from getting foul of the Bon-homme Richard, in the Bay of Bi&s;cay; for in&s;tead of putting his helm a-weather, and bear|ing up to make way for his commanding officer (which was his duty) he left the deck for to load his pi&s;tols.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="58" REF="018549_0058_0FA7ADA21FC20CF8">"<HI>2</HI>d.

<P N="3">"<HI>3</HI>d. Captain Landais behaved with di&s;re&s;pect and impertinence towards the commander in chief of the &s;quadron, on frequent occa&s;ions.</P>

<P N="5">"<HI>5</HI>th. He very &s;eldom an&s;wered any of them.</P>
<P N="6">"<HI>6</HI>th. He expre&s;&s;ed his fears and apprehen&s;ions of being taken off the coa&s;t of Ireland, and in&s;i&s;ted on leaving &s;ight of it immediately, when we had cruized there only two days.</P>
<P N="7">"<HI>7.</HI> His &s;eparation from the &s;quadron the fir&s;t time, mu&s;t have happened either through ignorance or de&s;ign, becau&s;e, though he had di&s;tinctly &s;aw the &s;ignal for the cour&s;e before night, yet he altered it fir&s;t two, then four points of the compas before morning.</P>
<P N="8">"<HI>8</HI>th. His &s;eparation from the &s;quadron the &s;econd time, mu&s;t al&s;o have happened through igno|rance or de&s;ign, becau&s;e the wind being at N. W. and the other &s;hips, <HI>to his knowledge,</HI> laying to, and being a-&s;tern of the Alliance, what le&s;s than &s;eparation could be the con&s;equence of his ob&s;tinacy in ordering the weather main-brace to be hauled in, and the &s;hip to be &s;teered S. W. and S.

<P N="9">"<HI>9</HI>th. On the morning of the <HI>23</HI>d of September, when the Bon-homme Richard, after being off the Spurn, came in &s;ight of the Alliance and the Pallas off Flamborough-head, Capt. Landais di&s;tinctly told Capt. Cottineau that if it was, as it appeared, a <HI>50</HI> gun &s;hip, they mu&s;t run away, although he mu&s;t have been &s;ure that the Pallas, <HI>from her heavy &s;ailing,</HI> mu&s;t have fallen a &s;acrifice.</P>
<P N="10">"<HI>10</HI>th. In the afternoon of the &s;ame day, Capt. Landais paid no attention to &s;ignals, particularly the &s;ignal of preparation and for the line, which was made with great care and very di&s;tinctly on board the Bon-homme Richard.</P>
<P N="11">"<HI>11</HI>th. Although the Alliance was a long way ahead of the Bon-homme Richard, when bearing down on the Baltic fleet, yet Capt. Landais lay out of gun &s;hot to windward, until the Bon-homme Richard, pa&s;&s;ed and clo&s;ely engaged the Serapis, and then in&s;tead of coming to clo&s;e action with the Counte&s;s of Scarobrough, the Alliance fired at very long &s;hot.</P>
<P N="12">"<HI>12</HI>th. He continued to windward, and a con&s;iderable time after the action began, fell a&s;tern and &s;poke the Pallas, leaving the Counte&s;s of Scarborough in the wake of the &s;hips engaged, and at free liberty to rake the Bon-homme Richard.</P>
<P N="13">"<HI>13</HI>th. After the Bon-homme Richard and Serapis were made fa&s;t a long &s;ide of each other, as in the margin, (which was not done till an hour after the engagement began) Capt Landais, <HI>out of mu&s;ket &s;hot,</HI> raked the Bon-homme Richard with cro&s;s-bar and grape-&s;hot, &amp;c. which killed a number of men, di&s;mounted &s;undry guns, put the &s;ide lights cut, and &s;ilenced all the <HI>12</HI> pounders.</P>
<P N="14">"<HI>14</HI>th. The Alliance then ran down towards the Pallas and Counte&s;s of Scarborough, that were at that time engaged at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance to leeward of the Bon-homme Richard and Serapis; and Capt. Landais hovered about there out of gun-&s;hot, and without firing, till &s;ome time after the Counte&s;s of Scarborough had &s;truck, and then bore down under his top&s;ails, and &s;poke fir&s;t the prize, and then the Pallas, a&s;king a number of que&s;tions.</P>
<P N="15">"<HI>15</HI>th. At la&s;t Capt. Landais made &s;ail under his top&s;ails to work up to windward, but made tacks before he (being within the range of grape &s;hot, and at the longe&s;t three quarters of an hour before the Serapis &s;truck) fired a &s;econd broad-&s;ide into the Bon-homme Richard's larboard quarter, the part whereof was fired when the Alliance was not more than three points abaft the Bon-homme
<PB N="59" REF="018549_0059_0FA7ADA2369338D0">
Richard's beam, although many tongues had cried from the Bon-homme Richard that Capt. Landais was firing into the wrong &s;hip, and prayed him to lay the enemy along &s;ide. Three large lanthorns with proper &s;ignal wax candies in them and well lighted, had al&s;o previou&s;ly to his firing, been long over the bow-quarter, and wai&s;t of the Bon-homme Richard, in a horizontal line, which was the &s;ignal of reconnoitring and the &s;hips, the one having a high poop, and being all black, the other having a low &s;tern, with yellow &s;ides, were ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hable, it being full moon.</P>
<P N="16">"<HI>16</HI>th. The Alliance then pa&s;&s;ed at very con&s;iderable di&s;tance, along the larboard or off &s;ide of the Bon-homme Richard, and having tacked and gained the wind, ran down again to leeward, and in cro&s;&s;ing the Bon-homme Richards' bow, Capt. Landais raked her with a third broad&s;ide, after being con&s;tantly called to from the Bon-homme Richard, not to fire, but to lay the enemy along &s;ide.</P>
<P N="17">"<HI>17</HI>th. Sundry men were killed and wounded by the broad&s;ides mentioned in the two la&s;t articles.</P>
<P N="18">"<HI>18</HI>th. Capt. Landais never pa&s;&s;ed on the off &s;ide of the Serapis, nor could that &s;hip ever bring a gun to bear on the Alliance, at any time during the engagement.</P>
<P N="19">"<HI>19</HI>th. The leaks of the Bon-homme Richard increa&s;ed much after being fired upon by the Alliance, and as the mo&s;t dangerous &s;hot which the Bon-homme Richard received under water, were under the larboard bow and quarter, they mu&s;t have come from the Alliance, for the Serapis was on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P N="20">"<HI>20</HI>th. Several people on board the Alliance told Capt. Landais at different times, that he fired on the wrong &s;hip, others refu&s;ed to fire.</P>
<P N="21">"<HI>21</HI>&s;t. The Alliance fired only three vollies, which within gun-&s;hot of the Bon-homme Richard and Serapis.</P>
<P N="22">"<HI>22</HI>d. The morning after the engagement, Capt. Landais acknowledged on board the Serapis, that he raked each time with grape &s;hot, which he knew would &s;catter.</P>
<P N="23">"<HI>23</HI>d. Capt. Landais has acknowledged &s;ince the action, that he would have thought it no harm if the Bon-homme Richard had &s;truck, for it would have given him an opportunity to retake her, and to take the Serapis.</P>
<P N="24">"<HI>24</HI>th. He has frequently declared that he was the only American in the &s;quadron, and that he was not under the orders of Capt. Jones.</P>
<P N="25">"<HI>25</HI>th. In coming into Texel, he declared that if Capt. Jones &s;hould hoi&s;t a broad pendant he would, to vex him, hoi&s;t another.</P>

<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that though his Excellency had tho&s;e charges again&s;t me long before, that he had never let me know it 'til then; but had examined me upon the four articles that contained them all, to which I had fully an&s;wered, &s;o that it left no room for tho&s;e articles to be brought in again,&mdash;that Capt. Jones had been a month mi&s;repre&s;enting facts, and having them &s;igned by men who dreaded to be detected for having left their quarters during the &s;laughter made on board the Bon-homme Richard by the Serapis (as may be &s;een in Capt. Jones's relation) that the younger were brought to &s;ign it fir&s;t, with Lieutenant-Colonel Wir|bert, who appears, nominally, detected in &s;aid relation; moreover, it appears that Capt. Jones had no real weighty charges to lay again&s;t me, &s;ince he invented or mi&s;con&s;tructed trifling fact to charge me with; however, to leave no room for his Excellency to &s;how he had a right to ex|ecute any plan again&s;t me, I made the following an&s;wers in writing.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>"The following articles are the an&s;wers to the five and twenty articles made by Capt. Jones, and other officers, the <HI>30</HI>th day of October, <HI>1779,</HI> at Texel, re&s;pecting the conduct of Capt. Landais, Captain of the American Frigate Alliance, brought to him November <HI>26</HI>th, <HI>1779.</HI></P>
<P>"The <HI>1</HI>&s;t. article has been an&s;wered and examined in a Court-martial, kept at l'Orient; for which the Fir&s;t-Lieutenant of the Bon-homme Richard was condemned and &s;ent away by a &s;econd &s;entence.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="018549_0061_0FA7ADA3B82FC230">"As to the helm, it was put a-weather, on board the Alliance, that was lying to, and the fore-top-&s;ail, that was &s;et on the cap, and lying a-back, it was filled; but the Alliance having no head-way, did not an&s;wer her helm, but &s;he began to go a-head when &s;he was boarded by the Bon-homme Richard, on her larboard mizen chains, or el&s;e &s;he would have been boarded in her main chains.</P>
<P>"Capt. Landais thinking it was the Pallas, when at a mu&s;ket &s;hot off, hailed her in French, and told them to take care, they were coming on board of him, and he could not avoid it, for the Alli|ance would not &s;teer, having no head-way: then he knew by the confu&s;ed voices he heard on board that &s;hip, that they &s;poke Engli&s;h, hearing no commander among&s;t the voices, and &s;eeing that &s;hip coming as de&s;ignedly to board him, he imagined the Engli&s;hmen that were on board had revolted, and had got ma&s;ters of the &s;hip, and were coming down upon the Alliance, on purpo&s;e to run her over, and if not, to board and take her by &s;urprize; he called Capt. Parke, who was but little way from him, a&s;ked him whether there was any mu&s;ket loaded, and if he had the arm-che&s;t key; Capt. Parke an|&s;wered him no (all that pa&s;&s;ed in le&s;s than &s;ix minutes) in that in&s;tant the Bon-homme Richard board|ed the Alliance, and the bow&s;prit of the former carried away the mizen-ma&s;t of the latter: Mr. Buckley a&s;ked Capt. Landais to hoi&s;t up the fore-top-&s;ail, the Captain told him yes, and run up the gibb: Then Capt. Landais almo&s;t convinced of what he imagined before, &s;eeing that manoeuvre, confu&s;ion, &amp;c. ran down in the cabin, and a&s;ked Jube (Mr. Blodget's negro) who was laying in the cabin, for his pi&s;tols; Jube told him they were in one of the trunks. Capt. Landais &s;taid in the cabin only the time of a&s;king the que&s;tion, and having the an&s;wer, which did not la&s;t more than five &s;econds, and he went back immediately upon the quarter deck, the &s;ame way he had gone down, (by the larboard gangway, the companion being covered with the mizen-ma&s;t pieces and rigging) and did not load his pi&s;tols"</P>
</LETTER>
<P>N. B I might have added that Capt. Jones in making that article, and &s;aying with empha&s;is, "<HI>for in&s;tead of putting his helm a-weather, and bearing up to make way for his commanding officer,</HI> (which was his duty) he &s;hows he knows no more the duty of an officer, under another's orders, than he knows how to command him; for an officer under orders is not to move his &s;hip from the &s;tation &s;he is in, until the commander has made a &s;ignal therefor, as the commander may have &s;ome rea&s;on to alter his own &s;hip's po&s;ition without any motion in the others; moreover Lieut.

Jones cau&s;ed to be broke, and had him condemned by a greater inju&s;tice &s;till, to be broke and rendered incapable to &s;erve his own country, America; all which I was told by Lieut.

After</HI> 2, <HI>A. M. the Bon-homme Richard, better than three miles leeward of us, made &s;ignal for forming the line of battle. As I was windward of her, and always ma&s;ter at any time to bear away in my &s;tation, I continued cha&s;ing; the wind very weak, at four, came Ea&s;t by South; then I began to bear away little; the cha&s;e being

Jones had no notion of it, nor which ve&s;&s;el was fit to get better windward: but the Alliance had gained only four miles during ten hours of fre&s;h breeze upon the cha&s;e, and could not gain five in two hours, being in the wind's eye, and in almo&s;t a calm weather, before night: moreover the wind had been ea&s;terly the four la&s;t days before, and there was &s;ome &s;ea, in which the Bon-homme Richard could &s;ail as well as the Alliance, for all that, the latter gained about four miles in the wind's eye, more than the former, which proves &s;he did not her utmo&s;t to come up, as did the Alliance, with the cha&s;e.</P>

<P>I carried and delivered tho&s;e written an&s;wers to his Excellency, and told him I had fully an|&s;wered all the charges laid again&s;t me, either verbally or in writing, that if there was any new one, or any of the other not completely an&s;wered, to give them to me in writing; he replied he knew no others.</P>
<P>His Excellency, after I had read to him and commented upon tho&s;e an&s;wers, told me I had better tran&s;late them in French, that he might &s;how them to the French Mini&s;ter; but I &s;uppo&s;e he wanted to have them tran&s;lated to be examined by &s;ea officers, to try whether nothing could be found therein to be taken hold of again&s;t me; however, though I had no bu&s;ine&s;s with the French Mini&s;ter, I did it, and carried it to him.</P>
<P>In pre&s;ence of Mr. Le Ray de Chaumont I, being an American officer, begged as a favor and ju&s;tice of his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to authori&s;e me, by his leave and appro|bation in writing, to have the &s;ketch, relation and certificates, &s;igned by all the officers of the Alliance; to be printed in Paris, &s;ince Capt. Jones's had been printed there; he refu&s;ed to give it me: I told him it was &s;urpri&s;ing to me, that he would not grant me my lawful demand, not only for my&s;elf, but for all the Alliance's crew which was concerned in it; their honour as well as mine having been calumniated by Capt. Jones's fal&s;e relation; which in all appearance had been printed by his authority or con&s;ent, as it was printed to be an extract of a letter from Capt. Jones to Dr. Franklin, which could not be taken out of &s;aid letter without his con&s;ent; he declared and a&s;&s;ured me he knew not by who&s;e authority, nor where it was printed, and &s;aid Capt. Jones might have had it printed in Holland for all he knew: though I imagined that which he told me was not likely, as I had no proof to the contrary, I &s;aid no more about it; but if his Excellency had been a philanthropos, as he is &s;aid to be, &s;ince he had arrogated him|&s;elf with, the power to take the command from a Captain and give it to another, and to judge between them, he would have had the &s;ketch &amp;c. of the Alliance printed, as the lea&s;t ju&s;tice that ought to be done to the Alliance's crew, but quite the contrary, and though he wanted to appear a competent and empowered judge, thought he was the &s;tronge&s;t party again&s;t the Alli|ance's crew and me.</P>
<P>The next day after I went occa&s;ionally to Mr. Le Ray de Chaumont, who told me I had puz|zled his Excellency the day before, about the relation of Capt. Jones, &amp;c. and he added it was not his Excellency that had it printed, but his grand&s;on had a&s;ked &s;everal times his grandfather to have it printed, and at la&s;t his Excellency gave it him to be printed: as &s;oon as I had made &s;ome ob&s;ervations thereabout, I left Mr. de Chaumont and went directly to his Excellency's, and reminded him how he had declared and a&s;&s;ured me he knew not by who&s;e authority, or where, Capt. Jones's relation had been printed, adding, that I had ju&s;t learned by Mr. Le Ray de Chaumont that his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, E&s;q: had him&s;elf given &s;aid relation to his grand&s;on William Franklin, to be printed, who had it done. His Excellency coolly di&s;|owned
<PB N="69" REF="018549_0069_0FA7ADAD6E07CC58">
the fact, and &s;aid I had mi&s;under&s;tood Mr. de Chaumont, or that gentleman was mi&s;ta|ken; but at that very in&s;tant, in came Mr. Le Ray de Chaumont, I a&s;ked him whether he had not told me that it was his Excellency's grand&s;on who had Capt. Jones's relation from his Ex|cellency's hands, to be printed: his Excellency gave no time to Mr. Chaumont to an&s;wer; but &s;aid it was not his grand&s;on he had given it to, to have it printed, it was to his nephew, Jonathan Williams; I replied it was the &s;ame to me, whether he gave it to his nephew or grand&s;on to be printed, and I told his Excellency, &s;ince you own it was to your nephew you gave it to be printed, you know then by who&s;e authority, and where it was printed, though you declared and a&s;&s;ured me you did not know either. His Excellency &s;aid as an excu&s;e, that he took particular care in giving it to his nephew, that there was nothing mentioned again&s;t any body, and that my name was not in it. I took out of my pocket the news-paper wherein it was printed, in which the Alliance was charged of having not paid attention to the &s;ignals made by the Bon-homme Richard, during the cha&s;e&mdash;that at la&s;t (at half pa&s;t nine o'clock) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Alliance appear|ed, and he di&s;charged a broad-&s;ide full into the &s;tern of the Bon-homme Richard, yet he pa&s;&s;ed along &s;ide the &s;hip and continued to fire; there was no po&s;&s;ibility of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;taking the enemies &s;hip for the Bon-homme Richard; he pa&s;&s;ed round firing into the Bon-homme Richard's head, &s;tern, and broad-&s;ide; and by one of his vollies killed eleven of his be&s;t men, and mortally wounded a good officer, on the foreca&s;tle only; the Bon-homme Richard received various &s;hots under water, from the Alliance. I a&s;ked his Excellency whether he remembered I had &s;howed him Congre&s;s' re&s;olve, by which I had the command of the Alliance, and therefore I could not be more formally charged before the public, than I was by that relation: his Excellency being put to a nonplus, I continued a&s;king him, was that your meaning, when you wrote and order|ed me to come from Holland to Paris, to ju&s;tify my&s;elf, "<HI>That I might be &s;ure to find in your Excellency, every di&s;po&s;ition to do that ju&s;tice to my character, which it &s;hould appear to merit.</HI>"&mdash; And at the &s;ame time you gave &s;uch relation again&s;t me to be printed in the news-papers, fir&s;t for caluminiating my character, in order after to do that ju&s;tice to my character, which it &s;hould then appear to merit by the public. I do not wonder that Capt. Jones told me you had em|powered him when at l'Orient, to take the command of the Alliance from me; I do not won|der if he has been &s;o ba&s;e as to accu&s;e me fal&s;ely, as he has done, knowing that he would be thus &s;upported; I do not wonder now, that out of partiallity, you have taken the Alliance from me, to give her to Capt. Jones; and I do not wonder if you are &s;o partial for Capt. Jones, he being &s;upported by your grand&s;on and nephew, and a proper man to &s;econd you in &s;uch things, as tho&s;e which have been done again&s;t my character: his Excellency &s;aid not a word: thought I is this the great, the wi&s;e, the ju&s;t, the deep man, &s;o much extolled; he ap|peared to me all the rever&s;e.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked his Excellency to give me an extract of Capt. Jones's letter relating to all he &s;aid about the Alliance, certified by him; he told me he had no time do it then, but he would as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. I told him, &s;ince he had detained me in Paris, and had given the command of the Alliance to Capt. Jones, that I begged his Excellency would write him to land my trunks and de|liver them into the American Agent's hands, in Holland: his Excellency would not do it, but wanted me to write to Capt. Jones, which I could not do in tho&s;e circum&s;tances; therefore all my things remained on board the Alliance, when &s;he went under Capt. Jones's command from Holland.</P>

<HEAD>"Extract of a letter from J. P. Jones, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to B. Franklin, dated on board the &s;hip of war Serapis, at anchor without the Texel, <DATE>Oct. <HI>3</HI>d, <HI>1779.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>"In the afternoon (<HI>23</HI>d Augu&s;t, <HI>1779</HI>) Capt. Landais came on board the Bon-homme Richard, and behaved towards me with great di&s;re&s;pect, in the mo&s;t indelicate language and manner, affirming that I had lo&s;t my boats and people, through my imprudence, in &s;ending boats to take a prize. He per|&s;i&s;ted in his reproaches, though he was a&s;&s;ured by Me&s;&s;'rs de Whichbort and Chamillard, that the barge was actually towing the &s;hip at the time of the elopement, and had not been &s;ent in pur&s;uit of the prize. He was affronted becau&s;e I would not the day before &s;uffer him to cha&s;e, without my or|ders, and to approach the dangerous &s;hore I have already mentioned (Skillocks) where he was an en|tire &s;tranger; and when there was not a &s;ufficient wind to govern a &s;hip. He told me he was the only American in the &s;quadron, and was determined to follow his own opinion, in cha&s;ing when and were he thought proper, and in every other matter that concerned the &s;ervice; and that if I continued three days longer in that &s;ituation, the &s;quadron would be taken, &amp;c.</P>
<P>"In the afternoon (<HI>31</HI>&s;t Augu&s;t <HI>1779</HI>) another &s;ail appeared, and I immediately made the &s;ignal for the Alliance to chace, but in&s;tead of obeying, he wore and laid the &s;hip's head the other way; the next morning I made &s;ignal to &s;peak with the Alliance, to which no attention was paid.</P>
<P>"The next morning (<HI>4</HI>th Sept) having weathered Fair I&s;le, and not &s;eeing the Vengeance nor the two prizes: I &s;poke the Alliance, and ordered her to &s;teer to the northward, bring them up to the rendezvous. On the morning (the <HI>5</HI>th) the Alliance appeared again, and had brought to two very &s;mall coa&s;ting &s;loops in balla&s;t, but without having attended properly to my orders of ye&s;terday; the Vengeance joined me &s;oon after, and informed me, that in con&s;equence of Capt. Landais orders to the Commanders of the two prizes &s;hips, they had refu&s;ed to follow him to the rendezvous. I am this mo|ment ignorant what orders the&s;e men received from Capt. Landais, nor know I by virtue of what authority he ventured to give his orders to prizes in my pre&s;ence, and without either my knowledge or approbation.</P>
<P>"In the evening I &s;ent for all the Captains to come on board the Bon-homme Richard, to con&s;ult on future plans of operations; Captains Cottineau and Ricot obeyed me; but Capt. Landais ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed; and after &s;ending me various uncivil me&s;&s;ages, wrote me a very extraordinary letter in an|&s;wer to a written order, which I had &s;ent him on finding that he had trifled with my verbal orders.</P>
<P>"When the fleet di&s;coverd us bearing down, all the merchants &s;hips crouded &s;ails towards the &s;hore; the &s;hips of war that protected the fleet, at the &s;ame time &s;teered from the land and made di&s;po&s;ition of battle; in approaching the enemy, I crouded every po&s;&s;ible &s;ail, and made the &s;ignal for the line of battle, to which the Alliance &s;howed no attention. Earne&s;t as I was for the action I could not reach the Commander's &s;hip, until &s;even in the evening, being then within pi&s;tol-&s;hot, when he hailed the Bon-homme Richard; we an&s;wered him by firing a whole broad&s;ide. The battle being thus be|gun, was continued with unremitting fury. Every method was practi&s;ed on both &s;ides, to gain an advantage, and rake each other; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s that the enemy's &s;hip being much more mana|gable than the Bon-homme Richard, gained thereby &s;everal times an advantageous &s;ituation, in &s;pite of my be&s;t endeavours to prevent it. As I had to deal with an enemy of a greatly &s;uperior force, I was under the nece&s;&s;ity of clo&s;ing with him to prevent the advantage which he had over me in point of manoeuvre. It was my intention to lay the Bon-homme Richard athwart the enemy's bow, but as that operation required great dexterity in the management of both &s;ails and helm, and &s;ome of our braces being &s;hot away, it did not exactly &s;uccced to my wi&s;h. The enemy's bow&s;prit, however, came over the Bon-homme Richard's poop, behind the mizenma&s;t, and I made both &s;hips fa&s;t together in that &s;ituation, which by the action of the wind on the enemy's &s;ails, forced her to &s;tern clo&s;e to the Bon-homme
<PB N="71" REF="018549_0071_0FA7ADB3E1918D38">
Richard's bow, &s;o that the &s;hips lay &s;quare along &s;ide of each other, the yards being all entangled and the cannon of each &s;hip touching the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. When this po&s;ition took place, it was near <HI>8</HI> o'clock, previous to which the Bon-homme Richard had received &s;undry eighteen pounds-&s;hot below the water, and leaked very much; my battery of twelve pounders, on which I placed my chief depen|dance, being commanded by Lieut. Dale and Col. Wirbert, and manned principally by American, &s;eamen and French volunteers, was entirely &s;ilenced and abandoned. As to the old &s;ix eighteen poun|ders that formed the battery of the lower deck, they did no &s;ervice whatever, except firing eight &s;hots in all, two out of three of them bur&s;t at the fir&s;t fire, and killed almo&s;t all the men who were &s;tati|oned to manage them. Before this time too, Col. Chamillard, who commanded a party of twenty &s;oldiers, on the poop, had abandoned that &s;tation, after having lo&s;t all his men except fiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I had now two pices of cannon (<HI>9</HI> pounders) on the quarter deck, that were not &s;ilenced, and not one of the heavier cannon was fired during the remainder of the action. The pur&s;er, Mr. Mea&s;e, who com|manded the guns on the quarter-deck, being dangerou&s;ly wounded in the head, I was obliged to fill his place; and with great difficulty rallied a few men, and &s;hifted over one of the lee quarter-deck guns, &s;o that we afterwards played three pieces of nine pounders upon the enemy. The tops only &s;econded the fire of this little battery, and held out bravely during the whole of the action e&s;pecially the maintop, which Lieut. Stack commanded. I directed the fire of one of the three cannons again<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the mainma&s;t, which doubled-headed &s;hot; while the two others were exceedingly well &s;erved, with grape and can|ni&s;ter-&s;hot, to &s;ilence the enemy's mu&s;ket, and clear her decks, which was at la&s;t effect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; The enemy were, as I have &s;ince under&s;tood, on the in&s;tant of calling for quarter, when the cowardi&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> treach|ery of three of my under officers, induced them to call to the enemy. The Engli&s;h Commodore a&s;ked me if I demanded quarters, and I having an&s;wered him in the mo&s;t determined negative, they renewed the battle with double fury; they were unable to &s;tand the deck; but the fire of their cannon, e&s;pe|cially the lower battery, which was entirely formed of eighteen pounders, was ince&s;&s;ant. Both &s;hips were &s;et on fire in various places, and the &s;cene was dreadful beyond the reach of language.</P>
<P>"To account for the timidity of my three under officers, I mean the Gunner the Carpenter, and the Ma&s;ter at Arms: I mu&s;t ob&s;erve that the two fir&s;t were badly wounded; and as the &s;hip had re|ceived various &s;hot under water, and one of the pumys being &s;hot away, expre&s;&s;ed his fears that &s;he would &s;ink; whence the two others concluded, that &s;he was &s;inking, which occa&s;ioned to run aft the poop, without my knowledge, to &s;trike the colours. Fortunately for me, a cannon-ball had done that long before, by carrying away the en&s;ign: he was therefore reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;inking, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, or of calling for quarters, and he preferred the latter.</P>
<P>"All this time the Bon-homme Richard had &s;u&s;tained the action alone, and the enemy though much &s;uperior in force, would have been glad to have got clear, as appears from their own acknowledge|ments, and by their having let go an anchor, the in&s;tant I laid them on board, by which means they would have e&s;caped, had I not made them well fa&s;t to the Bon-homme Richard: At la&s;t (at half pa&s;t <HI>9</HI> o'clock) the Alliance appeared, and I now thought the battle at an end, but to my utter a&s;toni&s;hment he di&s;charged a broad&s;ide full into the &s;tern of the Bon-homme Richard. We called to him for God's &s;ake to forbear firing into the Bon-homme Richard; yet he pa&s;&s;ed along the off &s;ide of the &s;hip, and continued firing. There was no po&s;&s;ibility of his mi&s;taking the en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">my's &s;hip for the Bon-homme Richard, there being the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential difference in their appearance and con&s;truction; be&s;ides, it was full moon light, and the &s;ides of the Bon-homme Richard we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> all black, while the &s;ides of the prize were yel|low. Yet for greater &s;ecurity I &s;howed the &s;ignal of our recogni&s;ance, by putting out three lanthorns, one at the head, one at the &s;tern, and the third in the middle, in a horizontal line. Every tongue cried that he was firing into the wrong &s;hip, but nothing would avail; he pa&s;&s;ed rou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d firing into the Bon-homme Richard, head, &s;tern, and broad&s;ide, and by one of his vollies killed clo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en of my be&s;t men, and
<PB N="72" REF="018549_0072_0FA7ADB4ED935FA8">
mortally wounded a good officer on the foreca&s;tle only. My &s;ituation was really deplorable; the Bon-homme Richard received various &s;hot, under water, from the Alliance; the leak gained on the pumps, and the fire increa&s;ed much aboard both &s;hips; &s;ome officers per&s;uaded me to &s;trike, of who&s;e courage and good &s;en&s;e, I entertain an high opinion. My treacherous Ma&s;ter at Arms, let loo&s;e all the pri&s;oners, without my knowledge, and my pro&s;pect became gloomy indeed. The enemy's mainma&s;t be|gan to &s;hake; their firing decrea&s;ed fa&s;t; ours rather increa&s;ed, and the Briti&s;h colours were &s;truck at half an hour pa&s;t <HI>10</HI> o'clock. This prize proved to be the Briti&s;h &s;hip of war the Serapis, a new &s;hip of forty-four guns, built on their mo&s;t approved con&s;truction, with two complete batteries, one of them eighteen pounders, and commanded by the brave Commodore Richard Pear&s;on. The Alliance too was in a &s;tate to pur&s;ue the fleet, not having had a &s;ingle man wounded, or a &s;ingle &s;hot fired at her from the Serapis, and only three from the Counte&s;s of Scarborough, at &s;uch di&s;tance, that one &s;truck in the &s;ide, and the other ju&s;t touched, and then dropped into the water. The Alliance killed one man only on board the Serapis.</P>
<P>"Upon the whole, the Captain of the Alliance has behaved &s;o very ill in every re&s;pect, that I mu&s;t complain loudly of his conduct; he pretends he is authori&s;ed to act independent of my command; I have been taught the contrary; but &s;uppo&s;ing it to be &s;o, his conduct has been ba&s;e and unpardonable.</P>

I am going for tho&s;e that are no &s;ea-officers (for tho&s;e who are, may &s;ee through it) to put in a clear light the fal&s;hood hidden in Capt. Jones's letter and relation to his Excellency: the fir&s;t extract begining thus "<HI>In the afternoon</HI> (23<HI>d Au&s;t.</HI> 1779) <HI>Capt. Landais came on board the Bon-homme Richard, &amp;c.</HI>" is explained page 12 and 13, where it is &s;aid, that the Skillocks bore S. E. &frac12; E. at five miles di&s;tance, certified by Mr. Varage, and the cha&s;e N. N. W. therefore there was no danger in cha&s;ing, to go towards the Skillocks, but to the contrary, in cha&s;ing &s;he would have gone further from tho&s;e rocks, which &s;hews it is an eva&s;ion and an impo&s;ition of Capt. Jones's. The &s;econd extract beginning thus "<HI>In the af|ternoon</HI> (31<HI>&s;t Augu&s;t,</HI> 1779) <HI>another &s;ail, &amp;c.</HI> is explained (page 31) he does not mention that the Alliance was manning the prize-&s;hip Union, and had on board, her own boats and thirty men, which made it impracticable for her to leave them, and cha&s;e: But Capt. Jones does not &s;ay that the Bon-homme Richard was there doing nothing, and did not cha&s;e the &s;ail in &s;ight, as &s;he ought to have done. The third extract beginning thus "<HI>The next morning</HI> (4<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h Sept.) having weathered, &amp;c.</HI>" is explained (page 31 and 32) he &s;ays he is ignorant by what autho|rity
<PB N="73" REF="018549_0073_0FA7ADB5067BD210">
I ventured to give orders to my prizes, one of which took when the Bon-homme Richard was above fifty leagues di&s;tance from the Alliance, which he had certainly no right to; the other I had taken when he was three miles off; I may &s;ay I gave them orders, being authorized to do it by my commi&s;&s;ion from Congre&s;s, and by his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, E&s;qr's orders to me. The fourth extract beginning thus, "<HI>In the evening I &s;ent for all the Captains,</HI>" is explained (page 15th) but he does not mention the purport of my extraordinary letter I wrote to him in an&s;wer to his orders, becau&s;e therein was hinted the rea&s;on he had given me (on the 23d Sept.) to never go again on board his &s;hip; he does not &s;ay that he never was willing to &s;how me any voucher to prove I was under his orders, becau&s;e it was the &s;nare laid, wherein to find me guilty, had I obeyed him and broke his Excellency's orders to me, and by the &s;ame principle he would never give me written order to follow him, though demanded, as certified by Capt. Cottineau, as it would in &s;ome degree have ju&s;tified me.</P>
<P>Now I am going to comment on Captain Jones's own relation, of the cha&s;e and engage|ment on the 23d September, &s;how his art in writing fal&s;hood and mi&s;repre&s;ention, and explain the motives I conceived he did it for: to do it clearly, I will take it by paragraphs, and write the fir&s;t and la&s;t words of each and explain it thus&mdash;"<HI>When the fleet di&s;covered us, &amp;c."&mdash; "The Alliance &s;howed no attention.</HI>"</P>
<P>If Capt. Jones means, when at half pa&s;t one o'clock, the Alliance &s;howed a &s;ignal for two &s;hips in &s;ight, and the Bon-homme Richard &s;howed another to cha&s;e them, he then could not &s;ee the fleet, which was imbayed clo&s;e to the land, between Flamborough's and Scarborough's-head, his &s;hip being &s;outh of Flamborough's-head; Capt. Jones being at ten miles di&s;tance, could not know what di&s;po&s;ition they were making on board the Engli&s;h men-of-war but by gue&s;s, he could not mean that they formed the line then, as it was about &s;ix o'clock when they did it; Capt. Jones, with his peculiar art of di&s;gui&s;ing the truth, &s;ays, he crowded "<HI>every po&s;&s;ible &s;ail,</HI>" wanting to be under&s;tood as though he did it as &s;oon as the enemies appeared, and do not &s;ay it was after the Bon-homme Richard had kept clo&s;e to the wind or brought to, wait|ing for the pilot &s;chooner, until after four o'clock, which fir&s;t blunder and delay gave ri&s;e to all which &s;ucceeded:&mdash;Capt. Jones &s;ays that he made the &s;ignal for the line of battle, but do not &s;ay when, nor what line of battle, by which he proves that he knows words, but do not under|&s;tand their meaning, as there are as many different lines upon which a battle may be given as may be imagined, be&s;ides the di&s;tance from &s;hip to &s;hip mu&s;t be given likewi&s;e; therefore if Capt. Jones had made &s;uch an in&s;ignificant &s;ignal, and the Alliance had &s;een it, &s;he could do no more to obey it than &s;he did, for wherever &s;he was, &s;he was upon a line with the Bon-homme Richard: but Capt. Cottineau of the Pallas, which was between the Bon-homme Richard and Alliance (in a letter whereof I will give a copy) &s;ays, if Capt. Jones made any &s;ignal, the Alliance could not perceive it in the po&s;ition &s;he was in.</P>
<P>&mdash;"<HI>Earne&s;t as I was, &amp;c."&mdash;"A whole broad-&s;ide.</HI>"</P>
<P>If Capt. Jones had been earne&s;tly willing for the action from the beginning, and had acted in con&s;equence as he ought to have done, with our combined &s;uperiour force, the battle would have been fought and ended during day time, without perhaps the lo&s;s of five men on our &s;ide, after which we might have been in a condition to take and de&s;troy the whole fleet of merchants ve&s;&s;els: by the watches of Capt. Spencer and mine, the engagement, or rather the fir&s;t gun fired, was at 8 minutes pa&s;t eight o'clock, and by Capt. Cottineau's it was four minutes pa&s;t eight; but Capt. Jones wants to make it appear it began &s;ooner for his own purpo&s;es: if Capt. Jones fired then his whole broad-&s;ide, he lo&s;t by it his &s;hots, as coming head long, as he did, upon the Serapis's broad-&s;ide, he could not point his guns to any effect, but his two foreca&s;tle cha&s;e
<PB N="74" REF="018549_0074_0FA7ADB5D90B25E8">
ones, and the Serapis had received during the engagement, but five &s;hots on her larboard &s;ide.</P>
<P>&mdash;"<HI>The battle being thus began, &amp;c."&mdash;"Endeavours to prevent it.</HI>"</P>
<P>It appears that the Serapis, taking advantage of the awkwardne&s;s of the Bon-homme Richard in coming upon her, began and continued with <HI>unremitting</HI> fury; but on board the Bon-homme Richard, I &s;uppo&s;e, without pretending to blame her crew, there was unremitting fear, owing to their leader's bad attack. Capt. Pear&s;on's method was by far better practi&s;ed than Capt. Jones's for raking his enemy: Capt. Jones &s;hould have &s;aid the enemy's &s;hip, being much bet|ter managed than the Bon-homme Richard (though &s;he al&s;o had a helm, braces, and bowlines as well as the other, of which I made no u&s;e) gained thereby &s;everal times an advantageous &s;ituation, in &s;pite of my be&s;t endeavours to prevent it, and defeated me by her three fir&s;t broad-&s;ides: he would have owned the truth clearly in that particular; but though he don't &s;ay &s;o directly, it may be under&s;tood by that, which he &s;aid con&s;idering that he wrote it.</P>
<P>&mdash;"<HI>As I had to deal, &amp;c."&mdash;"To my wi&s;h.</HI>"</P>
<P>The Bon-homme Richard could fight with &s;ix eighteen pounders on her lower deck, fourteen twelves upon her upper deck, five eights upon her quarter-deck and foreca&s;tle, all French me|tal, on one &s;ide; had three hundred and &s;eventy-five men going out of l'Orient, and twelve which were enli&s;ted out of the prizes men, which make in all three hundred and eighty-&s;even, out of which number to be deducted five-and-twenty men that ran away from her to Ireland, there then remains three hundred and &s;ixty-two.&mdash;The Serapis had ten eighteen pounders on her lower deck, ten nines upon her upper deck, and four &s;ixes on the quarter-deck and foreca&s;tle, all Engli&s;h metal, which &s;he could fight with on one &s;ide, had two hundred and eighty-eight men in all, out of which eight Ea&s;t-India men which would not fight, remains two hundred and eighty; in con&s;eqence the Bon-hommme Richard could &s;end every broad&s;ide on the enemy, three hundred and &s;ixteen pounds of &s;hots, French metal; the Serapis could, return but two hundred and eighty-four, Engli&s;h metal; if with this difference in metal, the Bon-homme Richard could &s;hoot in one broad-&s;ide is combined eighty two fighting men, &s;he had more than the Serapis, the moment of the Bon-homme Richard's whole force compared to the Serapis's whole one, will be :: 5 : 2; if the thickne&s;s and &s;toutne&s;s of the Bon-homme Richard, her height of quarter-deck, foreca&s;tle and tops, above tho&s;e of the Serapis, are con&s;idered as advan|tageous as they were in their po&s;ition, it will prove the Bon-homme Richard was really double the force of the Serapis, and will prove again, that Capt. Jones was wrong in &s;aying he had to deal with a &s;uperior force.&mdash;Capt. Jones pretends to a&s;cribe to his dexterity, the event of put|ting the Bon-homme Richard athwart the enemy's bow, which happened only by his &s;econd blunder in attacking the enemy, and it was impo&s;&s;ible in the &s;ituation he was in, after having received the fir&s;t broad-&s;ide, to do it otherwi&s;e, as the Bon-homme Richard, when coming down head-long upon the enemy's broad-&s;ide, had the Quarter-Ma&s;ter at the helm wheel killed (I have heard &s;ay) and the Bon-homme Richard, of it&s;elf, ran before the wind perpendicularly again&s;t the Serapis's larboard main &s;hrowds, which by their re&s;i&s;tance and oppo&s;ition fir&s;t &s;tuped, and after by their ela&s;ticity and re-action, made the Bon-homme Richard go &s;omewhat a&s;tern, at the &s;ame time the Serapis's &s;tern, by the impul&s;ion &s;he had received in her main &s;hrowds, falled leeward, and of cour&s;e her head came in the wind; the wind being then on her top-&s;ails made her go a&s;tern, by that time the Bon-homme Richard, who had been pu&s;hed back, was &s;oon &s;topped, having the wind off, which made her go ahead, and pa&s;s before the Serapis, who had been a&s;tern enough to let her, but the Serapis having made her falling, going ahead, ran her bow&s;prit in the Bon-homme Richard's &s;tarboard mizen &s;hrowds, (&s;ee the tenth po&s;ition) what proves it was accidental, and not de&s;igned by Capt. Jones, is, that the Bon-homme Richard in that advantage|ous
<PB N="75" REF="018549_0075_0FA7ADB679034E70">
po&s;ition, did not fire a &s;ingle gun to rake the Serapis, which would not have been omitted had it been fore&s;een.</P>
<P>&mdash;"<HI>The enemy's bow&s;prit, &amp;c."&mdash;"All his men except five.</HI>"&mdash;</P>
<P>The que&s;tion might properly be made to Capt. Jones, what could induce him to leave his command and po&s;t on the quarter-deck, to go upon the poop and make fa&s;t him&s;elf the Serapis's bow&s;prit to his &s;hip, at a time when all his crew had fled from their quarters, &s;ince they had not fired a gun in that advantageous po&s;ition, which Capt. Jones owns him&s;elf in the latter part of the paragraph; another que&s;tion to the &s;ame purport might be put to him, which is, whether the crew had abandoned him, &s;o that he had not a &s;ingle man left to &s;end to make fa&s;t the Sera|pis's bow&s;prit to his &s;hip, or not? if he &s;ays he had, why did he leave his command and po&s;t at &s;uch a critical time to do it him&s;elf? If he &s;ays he had not, what rea&s;on can he give for making fa&s;t the Serapis's bow&s;prit to his &s;hip, when he had not a &s;ingle man left to obey him or defend her, whil&s;t the Serapis's crew encouraged by the confidence, well de&s;erved, they had for their leader, their fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, and the Bon-homme Richard's firing being &s;ilenced, kept their quar|ters and fired with unremitting fury? he could certainly make no an&s;wer that could ju&s;tify his boa&s;ted action of making fa&s;t the two &s;hips together; but here is my opinion of the motive, which I leave the reader to judge, that induced Capt. Jones to make fa&s;t the two &s;hips together him&s;elf, as he could have no other (&s;ee the tenth po&s;ition) he &s;eeing that the Serapis having not yet fired a gun from her &s;tarboard &s;ide batteries, had them all ready to fire as &s;oon as the bow of one &s;hip &s;hould come again&s;t the &s;tern of the other, as in the eleventh po&s;ition, which was unavoid|able; fearing that he &s;hould fall by that broad-&s;ide, had he &s;tood at his po&s;t on the quarter-deck, he went upon the poop, where none of the Serapis's batteries guns could be pointed under her own bow&s;prit, and where the tops were prevented from firing by the top-&s;ails bunts, therefore Capt. Jones was there very &s;afe from any danger in that dreadful moment; but there were &s;everal wounded volunteers lying on the poop, who might have ob&s;erved his retreat there and revealed it, to prevent which, he made the enemies bow&s;prit fa&s;t to his &s;hip, for an excu&s;e of his being there.&mdash;Capt. Jones &s;ays it was near eight o'clock when the two &s;hips lay &s;quare along &s;ide each other, and had their yards entangled together; but he &s;ays previous to that (which mu&s;t be a very &s;hort time after the engagement began) his &s;hip had received &s;undry eighteen pound &s;hots, and leaked very much (by and by he will &s;ay, as is already &s;aid in the 19th arti|cle, that tho&s;e &s;hots and others &s;he had received from the Serapis, during the re&s;t of the engagement were fired by the Alliance) and he adds that his battery of twelve pounders was entirely &s;ilenced and abandoned then (how could he &s;ay in the accu&s;ations he made again&s;t me, &s;igned by his abettors, that Capt. Landais, which he &s;ays, came after nine o'clock, article 13th, raked the Bon-homme Richard, killed a number of men, di&s;mounted &s;undry guns, and &s;ilenced all the twelve pounders? this paragraph proves evidently his and abettors impo&s;ition as well as the re&s;t) moreover, he owns that his lower battery was then likewi&s;e abandoned, as well as his poop, where fifteen men had been killed out of twenty; therefore it proves con&s;picuou&s;ly that his &s;hip was totally abandoned &s;oon after the engrgement began, that &s;he was not in a condition to be fa&s;tened with the enemy, and that Capt. Jones and his abettors were wrong in charging the Alliance of all the di&s;a&s;ters the Bon-homme Richard had &s;uffered by her leader's fault from the Serapis's fire.</P>
<P>&mdash;'<HI>I had now two pieces, &amp;c."&mdash;"At la&s;t effected.</HI>"</P>
<P>Capt. Jones owns that no other cannon was fired from his &s;hip, during the remainder of the action, but three nine pounders on the quarter-deck, "<HI>that with great difficulty he rallied a few men.</HI>" Certainly that part of his &s;hip was al&s;o abandoned,&mdash;He &s;ays, "<HI>Mr. Maze being
<PB N="76" REF="018549_0076_0FA7ADB7362A0EF0">
wounded, he was obliged to fill his place.</HI>" This was wrong again of Capt. Jones, in &s;uch cir|cum&s;tance, not to try to rally more men, and leave his command on the middle of the quarter-deck, and go him&s;elf to load or point a cannon during the re&s;t of the action, as he did, when he could certainly &s;end an officer to force a man to come and replace Mr. Meaze; but it ap|pears he preferred that new po&s;t, where he was covered by the &s;hip's &s;ide or brea&s;twork (being impo&s;&s;ible for the enemy to point any cannon there) to his real po&s;t on the middle of the quarter-deck, where he would have been in danger of being fired at from the Serapis's tops. He &s;ays, "<HI>That he directed the fire of one of tho&s;e three cannon again&s;t the main-ma&s;t of the enemy.</HI>"&mdash; He does not tell the true rea&s;on why, but is mo&s;t likely he wanted to clear his &s;hip, which he could not do but by &s;hooting away the Serapis's main-ma&s;t, which was entangled with his; this &s;hows that though he had his little battery more then, than when he had made the two &s;hips fa&s;t together, he wanted to go away, which proves he made them fa&s;t together for an excu&s;e of his going upon the poop, and al&s;o it proves he knew, and took, the places where there was no danger.</P>
<P>&mdash;"<HI>The enemies were, &amp;c."&mdash;"Reach of language.</HI>"</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing that Capt. Jones had really cleared the enemy's quarter-deck, and &s;ilenced his mu&s;ketry there, as he pretends to per&s;uade the public (which is totally di&s;owned by Captain Pear&s;on's relation) he is more guilty than a common impo&s;ter to invent, that the enemy were on the in&s;tant to call out for quarters, when on their lower and upper deck they had not yet had a &s;ingle man even wounded by the Bon-homme Richard's fire, and where &s;he could not wound one with her three quarter-deck guns, which were &s;o high above the quarter-deck of the enemy, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to point them low enough to &s;hoot even in the quarter-deck planks; he dares not only refu&s;e the eulogium due to the notorious good conduct of Capt. Pear&s;on, but charges him of his willingne&s;s to call for quarters, when he was certain to &s;ink at la&s;t the Bon-homme Richard with her two batteries, had &s;he not been a&s;&s;i&s;ted: all which &s;hows his only principle was to hide his faults, charge them upon others, and appear a hero (at lea&s;t upon paper) to tho&s;e that could not under&s;tand thoroughly his relation.</P>
<P>&mdash;"<HI>To account for the timidity, &amp;c."&mdash;"Preferred to the latter.</HI>"</P>
<P>This paragraph proves that the Bon-homme Richard was very leaky by the various &s;hots &s;he had received under water from the Serapis, even at that time: and had Capt. Jones been at his po&s;t on the middle of the quarter-deck, it would have prevented tho&s;e three men who did not &s;ee any com|mander left whatever, to call to the enemies for quarters, and go upon the poop to &s;trike the colours.</P>
<P>&mdash;"<HI>All this time, &amp;c."&mdash;"Well fa&s;t to the Bon-homme Richard.</HI>"</P>
<P>Capt. Jones repre&s;ents Capt. Pear&s;on as a coward, &s;aying fal&s;ely that his &s;hip was &s;uperior in force to the Bon-homme Richard, though the latter had been almo&s;t totally di&s;abled, and was nigh &s;inking by the three fir&s;t broad-&s;ides &s;he had received from the Serapis, which Capt. Jones &s;ays then, "<HI>would have been glad to have gone clear, as appears by their own acknowledge|ment.</HI>" This is fully di&s;owned in Capt. Pear&s;on's relation, as well as by all the verbal decla|rations I have heard by his officers; and he gives as proof thereof, that the Serapis "<HI>let go an anchor the in&s;tant the Bon-homme Richard hung by her mizen-&s;hrowds, to the Serapis's gib-boom, and Capt. Jones made the&s;e two &s;hips fa&s;t together.</HI>" Though Captain Pear&s;on can never be too much prai&s;ed for his pre&s;ence of mind in that particular in&s;tance, con&s;idering that the &s;mall S. W. wind which blew then was decrea&s;ing very fa&s;t from the time of the beginning of the cha&s;e, and to &s;uch a degree, that a quarter of an hour after the engagement was over, it was quite calm until &s;ix the next morning, that the current then until midnight, ran at the rate of more than two knots and an half from north to &s;outh, and that the Alliance, Pallas, and Counte&s;s
<PB N="77" REF="018549_0077_0FA7ADB80056C6D8">
of Scarborough were &s;outhward of the Bon-homme Richard and Serapis, whence if it had calmed a little &s;ooner, or the Alliance had not &s;ailed in a light wind and &s;mooth &s;ea, as &s;he did, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for her to go to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Bon-homme Richard, which mu&s;t have been taken, by being fa&s;tened along &s;ide the Serapis, being at anchor: there|fore Capt. Jones, in this paragraph, as in all others, is wrong in impeaching the brave Capt. Pear&s;on, in&s;tead of giving the prai&s;e due to his &s;kill, and rai&s;ing his own fallacious glory.</P>
<P>&mdash;"<HI>At la&s;t (at half pa&s;t nine o'clock) &amp;c."&mdash;"And continued firing.</HI>"</P>
<P>Capt. Jones hinted the engagement began at &s;even o'clock, and &s;ays in this paragraph the Alliance appeared only at half pa&s;t nine, which is two hours and an half after: but in the 13th article of the charges he made again&s;t me, and had &s;igned by his abettors, he &s;ays, "<HI>That after the Bon-homme Richard and Serapis were made fa&s;t along &s;ide of each other (which was not done until an hour after the engagement begun) Capt. Landais out of mu&s;ket &s;hot raked the Bon-homme Richard, &amp;c.</HI>" which implies it was about an hour after the begining of the engagement, that the Alliance raked (he &s;ays) the Bon-homme Richard, which makes an hour and an half difference that there is between the time mentioned in &s;aid charges &s;igned by his abettors, and this charge in his relation, for the time the Alliance appeared, which is enough to prove that he was wrong in his articles, or relation of accu&s;ations: moreover, both are wrong, as it was not above thirty-five minutes after the beginning of the engagement when the Alliance raked the Serapis from &s;tern to head: but Capt. Jones's mi&s;repre&s;entation as to time, is not the only &s;triking ones in this paragraph, as he &s;ays, "<HI>But to my utter a&s;toni&s;hment he di&s;charged</HI> (&s;peaking of me) <HI>a broad-&s;ide full into the &s;tern of the Bon-homme Richard, yet pa&s;&s;ed along the off &s;ide of the &s;hip and continued firing.</HI>"&mdash;Any impartial man who was in that engagement, or had &s;een the &s;ketch and relation, &s;igned by all the officers of the Alliance, would be apt to think that Capt. Jones was not there, or had lo&s;t all his natural &s;en&s;e or remembrance, when he wrote his relati|on, in making &s;uch charges again&s;t me: there is no further need of proving the fal&s;hood of it, but by looking at the eleventh po&s;ition of the &s;ketch, to &s;ee that the Alliance, after having raked the fir&s;t time the Serapis full in her &s;tern by a broad-&s;ide, fired no more then, but pa&s;&s;ed before the head of the Bon-homme Richard, as they were head again&s;t &s;tern; con&s;equently, it was impo&s;&s;ible to rake the Bon-homme Richard in her &s;tern, after which the Alliance turned her &s;tern to the Bon-homme Richard's bow, as may b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;een by the dotes in the &s;ketch, to mark her way, and went directly towards the Counte&s;s of Scarborough, far from pa&s;&s;ing along &s;ide of his &s;hip, as he awkwardly &s;ays, by which he proves that he does not leave the appearance of a po&s;&s;ibility in his fal&s;e accu&s;ations.</P>
<P>&mdash;"<HI>There was no po&s;&s;ibility of his mi&s;taking, &amp;c"&mdash;"On the foreca&s;tle only.</HI>"</P>
<P>There was no po&s;&s;ibility of any on board the Alliance to mi&s;take one &s;hip for another, which is certified by all the officers of the Alliance, and that &s;he raked effectually, at three different times, the Serapis, without any mi&s;take whatever: but Capt. Jones peremptorily and preci&s;ely affirms, "<HI>That by one of my vollies, I killed eleven of his be&s;t men, and mortally wounded a good officer on the foreca&s;tle only.</HI>" How can Capt. Jones affirm any &s;uch thing &s;o particularly and po&s;i|tively, as to tell the number and quality of men killed, and mention an officer mortally wounded on the foreca&s;tle only by the Alliance, without telling his name to have it known? it mu&s;t be all a my&s;tery to every body, even to Capt. Jones, if the gho&s;t of tho&s;e eleven of his be&s;t men did not ap|pear and tell him they were killed by the Alliance: and Capt. Jones might then have cro&s;s-que&s;ti|oned them, to know the truth, a&s;king them how they could remain unhurt upon the foreca&s;tle, when raked from head to &s;tern; where all the Serapis's &s;hots pa&s;&s;ed fir&s;t, and de&s;troyed every thing in their way, going upon the poop, where they de&s;troyed fifteen volunteers out of twenty,
<PB N="78" REF="018549_0078_0FA7ADB8B2171AD8">
and made the re&s;t, with their officer, leave that quarter. The gho&s;t mu&s;t have recour&s;e to &s;u|pernatural cau&s;es, as their only play, for their pre&s;ervation there then, to a&s;&s;ert their depo&s;ition, or be proved liars. But &s;uppo&s;e they made u&s;e of that play, and convinced thus Capt. Jones; another might be put to him, which is, why did he leave expo&s;ed, from head to toes, eleven of his be&s;t men, and a good officer, doing nothing whatever, upon the foreca&s;tle, in an unavoid|able danger, under the Serapis's tops and quarter-deck mu&s;keteers, which was clo&s;e to, and predominated the Bon-homme Richard's foreca&s;tle, and not &s;end nor call for one, at lea&s;t, of tho&s;e men, to replace him in loading and pointing the quarter-deck guns, that he might have re&s;umed his command? his an&s;wer mu&s;t be that he preferred his new po&s;t to the command of his &s;hip, and wanted to have tho&s;e men killed by the Serapis, or mu&s;t own there was none, as real|ly there could be none alive. But Capt Jones, to cover the true cau&s;e, thought expedient to charge me thus, with his mens lives, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e had lo&s;t by his own fault.</P>
<P>&mdash;"<HI>My &s;ituation was really deplorable."&mdash;"Gloomy indeed.</HI>"</P>
<P>I conceive that Capt. Jones's &s;ituation was deplorable even in his &s;econd &s;ituation, being re|duced from the beginning, to be &s;unk, or &s;trike to the enemy, which would have carried him to England, where he could expect nothing but a &s;ad reception, which made him hold on until the Alliance effected his deliverence out of tho&s;e dangers, and the reduction of the enemy: but he &s;ays, "<HI>That the Bon-homme Richard received various &s;hots under water from the Alliance, and the fire increa&s;ed much on board both &s;hips.</HI>" He does not remember, that he &s;aid before eight o'clock the Bon-homme Richard had received &s;undry eighteen pound &s;hot below the water, and leaked very much, and &s;ince that time, the ince&s;&s;ant fire of the Serapis's lower battery, could by no means &s;top the&s;e leaks, but rather increa&s;ed them, and naturally the water coming in the &s;hip all the time, and no body to pump it out, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily gain, without any other cau&s;e; and his charging the Alliance of having fired &s;everal &s;hots under water of the Bon-homme Richard, is like all the other damages he received by his own faults, from the Serapis.</P>
<P>&mdash;"<HI>The enemy's main-ma&s;t began to &s;hake, &amp;c."&mdash;"Richard Pear&s;on.</HI>"</P>
<P>Every one mu&s;t wonder and admire, what a &s;udden and happy change befel Captain Jones, when under &s;uch a gloomy pro&s;pect; and tho&s;e that believe his relation, all along, and particu|larly in this paragraph, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily acknowledge, fir&s;t his holine&s;s to credit it and a&s;cribe &s;aid change to a miracle wrought in his favor, for he &s;aid before eight o'clock his two decks battery and poop were abandoned, that his &s;hip was very leaky, &amp;c. &amp;c. that &s;ince that time he had &s;uffered an ince&s;&s;ant fire of the Serapis's two batteries; that he had nothing left but three quarter-deck guns (which could not point to the Serapis's hulk, or any man contained in it) that be&s;ides the Alliance came, and gave a full broad-&s;ide into the Bon-homme Richard, and pa&s;&s;ed along &s;ide and continued firing (and after he &s;ays) he pa&s;&s;ed round firing into the Bon-homme Richard's head, &s;tern, and broad-&s;ide, and by one of his volies killed eleven of my be&s;t men, and wounded a good officer, on the foreca&s;tle only. The Bon-homme Richard received various &s;hot under water from the Alliance: for all that, all at once he &s;ays, the enemy's main-ma&s;t began to &s;hake, their firing decrea&s;ed fa&s;t, ours rather increa&s;ed, and the Briti&s;h colours were &s;truck, at half pa&s;t ten o'clock. Miracles are un&s;peakable!&mdash;But tho&s;e that will not believe, blindly will find the natural cau&s;es of this change in Captain Jones's pro&s;pect, contained in the &s;ketch, relation, and certificates, &s;igned by all the officers of the Alliance, and in the relation of Captain Pear&s;on, to the Briti&s;h admiralty, which will prove the whole relation of Captain Jones, is compounded of mi&s;repre&s;entations, of fal&s;e imputations artfully contrived again&s;t the Alliance, tending to this paragraph, to extol him&s;elf above hu|man nature, and charge me, as Captain of the Alliance, of all he could imagine, to cover his
<PB N="79" REF="018549_0079_0FA7ADBCD5084AE8">
inability and mi&s;conduct (by which he had his &s;hip and crew almo&s;t all de&s;troyed) to make me appear wor&s;e than any man extant. And tho&s;e that &s;crutinize and examine the po&s;&s;ibility, or impo&s;&s;ibility of things, after having peru&s;ed Capt. Jones's relation, in which he owns his &s;hip and crew were almo&s;t de&s;troyed, from the begining of the engagement, and all the engagement long by the Serapis, his &s;aying, that in addition the Alliance de&s;troyed his &s;hip and crew almo&s;t a &s;econd time, and as if by being de&s;troyed by her, it had rou&s;ed the courage of his men left at his little battery; dejected and ca&s;t down all the Serapis's crew; he &s;ays that their fire decrea&s;ed fa&s;t, that his rather increa&s;ed, without giving any rea&s;on why, the Briti&s;h colours were &s;truck; I leave to judge the probality thereof, and what Capt. Jones is capable of.</P>
<P>&mdash;"<HI>The Alliance &amp;c."&mdash;'On board the Serapis.</HI>"</P>
<P>I have already an&s;wered heretofore, all this paragraph, but the la&s;t phra&s;e that "<HI>the Alli|ance killed one man only on board the Serapis.</HI>" How is it po&s;&s;ible that Capt. Jones can a&s;&s;ert that the Alliance killed one man, and no other than one man, on board the Serapis; when Capt. Pear&s;on &s;ays, &s;he killed or wounded almo&s;t all his men on the quarter-deck and decks, which was the common report, likewi&s;e, of all his remaining officers; but it is in re&s;pect to this as the re&s;t of his relation.</P>
<P>&mdash;"<HI>Upon the whole, &amp;c.&mdash;'unpardonable.</HI>"</P>
<P>I will make but one ob&s;ervation in this la&s;t paragraph, as all the re&s;t is nothing but in&s;ults, from a man that knows how to avoid giving any &s;atisfaction for them. He &s;ays, &s;peaking of the Captain of the Alliance, "<HI>he pretends that he is authorized to act independent of my command, I have been taught the contrary.</HI> He does not &s;ay that he had any orders either from his Ex|cellency Benjamin Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> or any other by which I was really under his command, up|on which he would have in&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>I am afraid that I have been too prolix upon &s;uch a &s;ubject for &s;agacious readers, who may at once &s;ee through Capt. Jones's relation and views, but I thought it nece&s;&s;ary for tho&s;e that tru&s;t more to others judgment than to their own, who when they &s;ee any thing printed in a news|paper, believe it as being authentic, without daring to examine the propriety of it; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I never wondered at Capt. Jones's writing &s;uch relation as his to his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> but I always &s;ince did, do, and ever &s;hall, wonder how any impar|tial reader could believe it.</P>
<P>I expatiated verbally upon Capt. Jones's relation, before his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to prove to him the impo&s;ition contained therein, but all in vain; nothing could avail with him, though his Excellency could not give a rea&s;on why he had taken the command of the Alliance from me, to give it to Capt. Jones.</P>
<P>Here follow pieces which will &s;erve to de&s;troy &s;ome of the 25 articles made by Capt. Jones, and &s;igned by his abettors, and tho&s;e by him&s;elf, made again&s;t me, and will bring the truth to light, viz.</P>

<P>As it is proved heretofore and after, that on board the Bon-homme Richard, they commonly made &s;ignals in places where they could not be perceived, they omitted to make nece&s;&s;ary ones; and in the fir&s;t article above-mentioned, they did not an&s;wer the cutter Cerf's &s;ignal, it is evi|dent that Capt. Jones was guilty of the charge laid again&s;t me in his fifth article.</P>
<P>The &s;econd article above proves the rea&s;on Capt. Jones gives for having prevented the Al|liance from cha&s;ing on the 23d Augu&s;t (by which he had five-and-twenty of his men run away in two boats) to be fal&s;e, &s;aying it was to prevent the Alliance from approaching the dan|gerous &s;hore mentioned (Skillocks) which, according to Mr. Varage, bore S. E. &frac12; S. at five miles di&s;tance; and by the Alliance's logg-book, the ve&s;&s;el cha&s;ed, bore then N. N. W. there|fore if the Alliance had continued the cha&s;e, &s;he would have been in no danger of approaching the Skillocks, but to the contrary, &s;he would have gone further and further from it. It may be ob&s;erved al&s;o that Capt Jones had &s;aid to Mr. Varage, there was no danger in going clo&s;e to the Skillocks; but to ju&s;tify his preventing the Alliance cha&s;ing, by which he lo&s;t his men and boats; he contradicts him&s;elf, in &s;aying it was very dangerous.</P>
<P>By Mr. Varage's third article, it appears that Capt. Jones declared to him that his boats had run away ju&s;t after they came from taking the prizes: but Capt. Jones pretends in his own fir&s;t

charge again&s;t me, that his barge had not been &s;ent to take the prize, if &s;o, he was guilty of neglect in his duty, for not having made &s;aid barge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow off his &s;hip again&s;t the current from the land, &s;ince 3 o'clock, P.

<P>Capt. Cottineau's fourth, ninth, and twenty-fourth articles, corroborate with that, which I &s;aid there about, that I would not break his Excellency's orders to me, in following Capt. Jones, unle&s;s he would &s;end me written orders therefor: and that when the Bon-homme Richard and Vengeance appeared in the night to us, and Capt. Cottineau, &s;up|po&s;ing they would have proved enemies, a&s;ked me what I &s;hould do if the &s;hip proved to be a &s;ixty guns: that I an&s;wered, if &s;he was above fifty, we had nothing better to do than to make the be&s;t of our way to avoid them. In his eleventh he is mi&s;taken, as to the di&s;tance, which he could not a&s;certain, in the night, and being in the wind's eye, the Counte&s;s of Scarborough, right leeward of the Alliance, in the beginning, and before the engagement: it is explained in the Alliance's officers relation, which were in a better po&s;ition to judge it. In his twelfth, he gives the rea&s;on why the Alliance could not engage the Counte&s;s of Scarborough clo&s;er, becau&s;e, if &s;he had bore on her to do it, &s;he could not have fetched after, on the &s;ame tack, the Bon-homme Richard and Serapis: he explains likewi&s;e, that the Alliance remained windward, relatively to the Pallas, who bore before the wind. In the 24th he owns the Alliance bore upon him about an hour after the engagement began; but as &s;he had bore away, fir&s;t to go and rake the
<PB N="83" REF="018549_0083_0FA7ADBF72BB5DA0">
Serapis (which took about a quarter of an hour's time to perform) it was then at mo&s;t three quarters of an hour after the engagement began. Capt. Cottineau mu&s;t be mi&s;taken again, owing to the &s;moke or &s;omething el&s;e, as to the di&s;tance, he thinks he was then leeward of the Bon-homme Richard; for it &s;hould have been impo&s;&s;ible for the Alliance to gain &s;ix hundred fa|thoms in the wind's eye, by &s;uch weather, to run two other tacks, tack about twice and bear away twice in that &s;pace of time, remaining until &s;eventeen minutes pa&s;t ten o'clock. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, by the by, that Capt. Cottineau owns that the Counte&s;s of Scarborough received &s;everal &s;hots in her larboard &s;ide (three of which at her water line were plugged) he would not &s;ay they were &s;ent from the Alliance&punc; though no other engaged her on that &s;ide, he always took care to &s;ay, the Alliance was at a greater di&s;tance when &s;he fired, than &s;he really was, fearing to dimini&s;h his glory.</P>
<P>I was upon very indifferent terms with Mr. Cottineau, he being affronted becau&s;e, during the engagement, I had told him to make more &s;ail and go to engage the Counte&s;s of Scarborough, whil&s;t I would go to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Bon-homme Richard, as mentioned in the Alliance's re|lation.</P>

<LETTER>
<P>"Extract of a letter from Mr. Cottineau, Captain of the Frigate Pallas, dated Nov. <HI>15</HI>th, <HI>1779,</HI> and his ob&s;ervations about the engagement on the <HI>23</HI>d of September.</P>
<P>"The &s;aid Mr. Cottineau di&s;approved Capt. Jones's conduct, for remaining three weeks off Scot|land, to burn Colier's ve&s;&s;els, rather than to go off Cape Muis, where he was ordered to cruize, warning him, that when one don't follow the orders he has, nothing but a complete &s;ucce&s;s can ju&s;tify him.</P>
<P>"The &s;aid Capt. Jones has ba&s;ely and fal&s;ely charged Mr. Ricot, Captain of the Vengeance: he has likewi&s;e overcharged Capt. Landais with a number of complaints again&s;t him.</P>
<P>"The &s;aid Capt. Jones is at mo&s;t capable of commanding a &s;mall privateer; one may judge it by the relation he has given about the engagement on Sept. <HI>23</HI>d, again&s;t the Sarapis and the Counte&s;s of Scarborough; wherein he &s;ays, he made the &s;ignal for the line of battle, which cannot be formed but in con&s;equence of the enemy's po&s;ition, then there is no &s;uch line determined, therefore &s;aid Capt. Jones proves his incapacity.</P>
<P>"That engagement &s;o famous, would have been le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful, if the Frigate Alliance had not raked twice the Serapis, and by that manoeuvre had not de&s;troyed <HI>35</HI> of her men; and Capt. Jones is wrong in &s;aying that the Alliance was a &s;econd enemy again&s;t him.</P>
<P>"The &s;aid Capt. Jones has mi&s;repre&s;ented the circum&s;tances, in &s;peaking of cha&s;ing the Baltic fleet, that fleet was four leagues windward, and clo&s;e to the land when the engagement began; after which there was a very thick fog that made the pur&s;uit after the fleet impracticable; and moreover, Capt. Jones never made a &s;ignal therefor; that is not the only thing he did forget, as during the en|gagement, he forgot that his &s;hip had a rudder and &s;ails, &s;ince he made no u&s;e of either whatever; his only occupation then was to cry out fire, and to point him&s;elf a cannon, by which neglect he left the Serapis to rake him three different times, which killed, by that awkwardne&s;s, at lea&s;t <HI>40</HI> of his men.</P>
<P>"If Capt. Jones, rather than go to the two Figates, which were going from the land, had cha&s;ed the fleet, we would have come near, and the action would have been nigh it, and we might have joined it after the reduction of the two Frigates.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="018549_0084_0FA7ADC2F875CFC8">"Had even Capt. Jones made any &s;ignals for the battle, the Alliance was in a po&s;ition whence &s;he could not perceive them. Said Capt.

When I departed from the Texel for Paris, according to your order, I brought with me only the nece&s;&s;ary papers for my ju&s;tification, and few cloaths, leaving on board the Frigate four trunks, containing my cloaths, books, &s;ea-charts, mathematics, optics and a&s;tronomic in&s;truments, all the &s;hip's papers and my own private ones: as I mu&s;t go to America to crave ju&s;tice and &s;ince I cannot go prudently there without the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary of tho&s;e things, I hope you will procure me the money to buy them, having been deprived of tho&s;e I had by following your orders; be&s;ides, I want &s;ome money for my daily expences.</P>

<P>Suppo&s;ing that letter was wrote to his Excellency, on that date, by the French Mini&s;ter, who being mi&s;informed on that account, not knowing the truth then, he was right, in &s;ome re&s;pects, to recommend to his Excellency an inquiry, in order to know whether I was really faulty or not, but he was wrong in dictating an arbitrary act to his Excellency, who being the repre&s;entative in France of a nation, which was contending for their freedom, in which conte&s;t that nation was &s;upported by France; and his Excellency &s;hould not have, again&s;t the principle that na|tion contended for, tyrannically put his le&s;&s;on in execution without my being &s;ent to America to be tried by a Court-martial, before I &s;hould be blotted out of Congre&s;s officers li&s;t: but his Excellency did not &s;top to the arbitrary dictate of Mr. de Sartine, which was conditional, be|ing in ca&s;e I had been found faulty, his Excellency, without Congre&s;s's order or a&s;&s;ent, out of of his own will, again&s;t a great many authentic proofs, corroborating one with the others, my dutifulne&s;s and good conduct, and Capt. Jones's bad conduct in general, and particularly for the lo&s;s of tho&s;e French volunteers, he tyrannically took the command of the Alliance from me, to give it to Capt. Jones.</P>
<P>Moreover it may be ob&s;erved by the by, that the French Mini&s;ter, did not even dictate the lawful cour&s;e, he was to follow him&s;elf for the officers of the French Navy, in &s;imilar ca&s;e, which is to &s;end the faulty one to his own nation, to be tried there, by a Court-martial, and be condemned therefor: but dictated his Excellency, to write to Congre&s;s, in order that they &s;hould blot me out of their &s;ea-officers li&s;t, without further puni&s;hment, as if he had nothing in view but to have me out of the American navy.</P>
<P>Another ob&s;ervation to be noticed in that French Mini&s;ter's letter is that, in &s;peaking of the &s;hip Alliance, he calls her an American Frigate, which, in French, imply a King or Re|public &s;hip from 20 to 60 guns: but &s;peaking of the Bon-homme Richard, he don't &s;ay &s;he was a French or American Frigate, or a French one in the American &s;ervice, which he could not have omitted had &s;he been either of the three. This particular, that &s;he was neither, but that &s;he was a privateer, appears to me fully corroborating with the extract of his Excellency's letter fol|lowing in an&s;wer to Commodore Gillon, who had acquainted him of the Engli&s;h de&s;ign (which they effected) to go and take Charle&s;town, in South-Carolina, and who a&s;ked for the command of the American fleet, compo&s;ed of the Bon-homme Richard, Alliance, Pallas, &amp;c. in order to go and relea&s;e, or defend that city, viz.</P>

<P>Which above letter from his Excellency coincides with the French Mini&s;ter's, to prove that the Bon-homme Richard, &amp;c. was not a King's nor United States' &s;hip, nor a King's &s;hip in the United States' &s;ervice, but that &s;he was a privateer belonging to the concerned, as expre&s;&s;ed in his Excellency's letter, who would not have made u&s;e of that derogatory mercantile deno|mination for man-of-war, in&s;tead of allied powers: another proof thereof is, that Capt. Cot|tineau told me he was concerned in the Pallas for the &s;um of eighty thou&s;and livres, and the Vengeance was Mr. Le Ray de Chaumont's property: that the Bon-homme Richard was not re&s;itted for the &s;econd cruize, as the King's &s;hips are, by the direction of the Commander and Intendant of the harbour; and any &s;tores &s;he wanted out of the King's yard &s;he could not ob|ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u without Mr. Gowrlade (Mr. Le Ray de Chaumont's corre&s;pondent) had given in writing that he was bound for the payment thereof, and that Capt. Jones had no French commi&s;&s;ion &s;ince being in the Texel, where he could &s;tay no longer by the winter &s;ea&s;on coming; a com|mi&s;&s;ion from the King was &s;ent him there (for the cruize only) in ca&s;e he &s;hould be compelled to go to Denmark or Sweden, to be received there.</P>
<P>But to acquaint the reader how I have heard (which I relate only as hear-&s;ay) that Capt. Jones became Captain of the Bon-homme Richard; that he had obtained from Congre&s;s, by the Hon. Robert Morris's influence, a commi&s;&s;ion of Captain of one of their &s;chooners; after he was &s;ent in the Ranger &s;loop of war to France, where he tyrannically u&s;ed both his officers and &s;eamen, particularly his Fir&s;t-Lieutenant, Mr. Simp&s;on (of Port&s;mouth in Hamp&s;hire) which he had confined at Bre&s;t in a common pri&s;on, where were the common French &s;eamen u&s;ually impri&s;oned for &s;ome crimes or others, during twenty-odd days, &amp;c. at which treatment to Lieut. Simp&s;on the other officers and crew were &s;o incen&s;ed again&s;t Capt Jones that they found means to drive him and Capt. Parke, his favourite, out of that &s;hip, and the com|mand of her was given to Lieut. Simp&s;on, who brought her to America. Capt. Jones having no pro&s;pect then left to come &s;afely and be employed there, as he had rea&s;on to think Lieut. Simp|&s;on's countrymen would &s;how him their di&s;atisfaction for having u&s;ed that officer as he had; but he had &s;omebody or other to &s;peak in his favour to Mr. de Sartine; be&s;ides, his Excellency, who has &s;hown &s;o much partiality in Capt. Jones's favour, and to whom he might have been re|commended by his intimate friend, the Hon. Robert Morris, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> &s;poke, very likely, a word in his behalf to Mr. de Sartine, who wrote a letter either to his Excellency or to Capt. Jones, that he would procure him, &s;ome employment; but by the indi&s;cretion of &s;ome one or other, the
<PB N="87" REF="018549_0087_0FA7ADC63311F980">
French navy officers having had &s;ome intelligence thereof, gave to under&s;tand to the French Mi|ni&s;ter, that a man who bore &s;uch character as Capt. Jones did in England, was not fit to be ad|mitted among&s;t them; at which Mr. de Sartine was puzzled, knowing the combined power and influence of tho&s;e officers in &s;uch ca&s;e on one &s;ide, and on the other that Capt. Jones had his a&s;|&s;urance to be employed, which, had Capt. Jones made public, might have given a &s;hake to Mr. de Sartine. In order to avoid either, a plan was laid for obtaining a King's &s;hip to fit out (the Bon-homme Richard was pitched upon) in order to go and land on &s;ome part of the coa&s;t of Ire|land or other adjacent i&s;land: the Marquis de la Fayette, and part of the regiment he was Colo|nel of, were to go on board of her, the planner repre&s;ented that the force of a &s;ingle &s;hip was too little to have any great effect, he had &s;omebody then to &s;upport his repre&s;entation, and the Alliance, Pallas, Vengeance, and Cerf, were ordered to l'Orient, where being all arrived and joined with the Bon-homme Richard, they were put under Capt. Jones's orders; when all the expences for fitting out tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, were made, and they were ready, the plan of that expediti|on was dexterou&s;ly printed in the Engli&s;h public news-paper, by which the execution of it became impractible, whereof, I &s;uppo&s;e, Capt. Jones did not grieve at, as he might have been embara&s;&s;ed in puting it in execution, and would have had a &s;uperior on board capable of judging his conduct in this re&s;pect: but by that plan being abandoned, he remained, he thought. Command|er of the little &s;quadron, without any &s;uperior on board to cen&s;ure his future deeds: the former plan being put a&s;ide, there was no immediate employment for tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, and if they had been di&s;armed, part of the expences for fitting them for &s;ea, mu&s;t have been totally lo&s;t, &s;ome|body of power or influence being well acquainted with the ca&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e, a&s;&s;ociated together, and obtained them for a cruize, an&s;wering for them, and accordingly became concerned in that little &s;quadron. But his Excellency, after the government had made over tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els to private men, would have expo&s;ed him&s;elf in keeping any longer the Alliance, United States' Frigate, under the Bon-homme Richard, become, by the above-mentioned circum&s;tance, a privateer, which happened during the time between the dates of his Excellency's fir&s;t and &s;econd orders to me, relative to the Bon-homme Richard, therefore he took care in the la&s;t one, not to put me under Capt. Jones's command: moreover, Capt. Jones was, perhaps, acquainted with &s;ome of the concerned's tran&s;actions, which they might not chu&s;e to have publi&s;hed, and had to pay for the &s;unk &s;hip, the Bon-homme Richard, but by rai&s;ing and &s;upporting Capt. Jones, far above his de&s;ert, they avoided tho&s;e dangers, as I &s;uppo&s;e the King took the lo&s;s of that &s;hip on govern|ment's account, on con&s;ideration of the unparelleled bravery, his Maje&s;ty was taugnt to believe of Capt. Jones.</P>

<P>Whil&s;t I was kept by his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> in Paris, I vi&s;ited frequently the Honorables Arthur Lee, R. D.

<P>One day, after I had dined, at the Honorable Arthur Lee, E&s;q's, he told me he conceived how wrongly I had been u&s;ed by my enemies in France: and added, that they had many friends in America, to whom they would write, and who would make intere&s;t there to ju&s;tify their deeds again&s;t me; be&s;ides that, Mr. de Sartine, by all appearance, would al&s;o write there to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, and I &s;hould never obtain ju&s;tice, therefore I had better deliver to him the commi&s;&s;ion I had of Congre&s;s; &s;uch a propo&s;al offended me (as it &s;howed me the little opinion he had of Congre&s;s' ju&s;tice or &s;agacity, and of my delicacy in &s;uppo&s;ing I would not come to America, my adopted country, where I was naturalized, to be tried, in order to ju&s;tify my former conduct) I told him that I wondered how he could a&s;k of an officer of honour, to deliver his commi&s;&s;ion to him, and expect he would do it, rather than go and &s;ubmit to the event of his trial, which would never vilify him more, let it be never &s;o unju&s;t, than to deliver his commi&s;&s;ion, to avoid it; but in&s;tead of giving up the point, he in&s;i&s;ted more than before upon it, which made me leave him abruptly, and I never &s;aw him &s;ince in Paris: had I been of a &s;u&s;pectful di&s;po&s;ition, it might have created in my mind, without other foundation, that pri|vate orders had been given, to get rid of me, by &s;ome means or other, as my reward for hav|ing brought the &s;hip Flamand and her cargo to America; for I could not comprehend what good my commi&s;&s;ion would have done him otherwi&s;e, but it would have deprived me of my right to claim for ju&s;tice, the gratuity, my pay and prize-money owing to me, as a de&s;erter who has abandoned his po&s;t, if I had given willingly my commi&s;&s;ion away: on the other hand, if he really wanted to give good coun&s;el in telling me not to go to America, he could have done it without in&s;i&s;ting on my delivering to him my commi&s;&s;ion, even if I had de&s;i&s;ted from all claim, I could have kept it without being a great burden to me; but I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e he had his own views in it, which I could never gue&s;s at, fearing to offend &s;omebody or other in thoughts.</P>

<P>I received the letter you did me the honor of writing to me the fir&s;t in&s;tant, and the enclo&s;ed certifi|cate, dated Feb. <HI>14, 1780,</HI> it might have been on the table when I was at your hou&s;e, but I don't recollect of having &s;een it at all.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t ob&s;erve that before that time, I had a&s;ked of your Excellency for &s;ome money, having long &s;ince &s;pent the remaining of the fifty Louis-d'ors, after I had reimbur&s;ed my&s;elf of what money I had took out of my own pocket for coming to Paris.</P>
<P>I have none of the officers on board the Frigate Alliance, now under my command, nor friend enough to a&s;k them to take the trouble to have my trunks landed and delivered to my direction; be&s;ide, they don't know, nor my&s;elf neither at pre&s;ent, what they contain; all I know is, that all the &s;hip's papers were in them, and I will not make my&s;elf accountable for the &s;hip's expence accounts, when I may have been deprived of them; be&s;ide, all my own things may have been plundered, and nothing but the trunks left. The Captain and officers are under your orders, and will obey them as &s;oon as your Ex|cellency will take the trouble to write to them to have the &s;aid trunks, &amp;c. &s;ealed up and delivered to the agent at l'Orient, where I expect to go and &s;earch whether they are as I left them, for I have to deal with people who have not the be&s;t character in England, according to their public papers; it was not &s;o either in England or France before your Excellency had a letter filled with fal&s;hood, from Capt. Jones, printed again&s;t mine. For my part, I don't judge in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tance, but will
<PB N="91" REF="018549_0091_0FA7ADCC39463B40">
not confide any more in them. If your Excellency had wrote to me at Texel, that the command of the Frigate Alliance was to be taken from me and given to another, I would have &s;pared you &s;uch trouble, but I came as you directed me&mdash;confiding in your ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>As to the Dutch money I received in Holland, and that which I received &s;ince in Paris, I am go|ing to make a &s;hort account of what I have &s;pent out of it, viz.&mdash;In Holland to go twice from the Helder to Am&s;terdam, and going back once; for twelve days during my &s;tay in Am&s;terdam, being two different times there, and travelling through Holland, I &s;pent all the Dutch money I had received: I &s;pent out of my own pocket money travelling through Flanders and France coming to Paris, nineteen Louis-d'ors, &s;o remained but thirty-one Louis-d'ors of the fifty I received fir&s;t for my daily expences. I have been here four months, and compelled to go to Pa&s;&s;y may be twenty times, and hire every time a coach, which expence amount to fifteen Louis-d'ors; my expence for my&s;elf and &s;ervant for living, lodging, firing, &amp;c. during four months, amount to about &s;ixty Louis-d'ors: and I find I have &s;pent ten Louis-d'ors for other &s;mall expences, &s;o I have now left &s;ixty-four Louis-d'ors: I &s;hall &s;pend five-and-twenty more to go where I may find a &s;hip; then I will have for provi&s;ions, &amp;c. twenty-nine Louis-d'ors; &s;o I wi&s;h your Excellency would be &s;o obliging as to tell me what I mu&s;t do for my pa&s;|&s;age, if I find one, which I have wrote for: for all, I believe it ought to be procured for me by your Excellency's order, as is u&s;ual among&s;t all nations, to provide proper means for an officer to go to be tried when accu&s;ed, even if he has been puni&s;hed before hand for what he is accu&s;ed of, without proper method.</P>
<P>As to my prize-money, I wi&s;h your Excellency would be &s;o obliging as to let me know whom I mu&s;t apply to for receiving it, that I may reimbur&s;e the money I have borrowed and &s;pent &s;ince I have been in Europe. I don't imagine your Excellency would have me receive in America, in paper money, what came to my &s;hare for the prizes &s;old in Europe for hard money, it &s;hould be a poor trade, and I doubt that my friends would accept it in return for the money I have drawn upon them. Excu&s;e my error if you plea&s;e; but I was told by &s;omebody that the Bon-homme Richard, &amp;c. were belonging to Congre&s;s; that you or the Congre&s;s' agent, had them at your command. When I have a&s;k'd your Ex|cellency for my monthly pay, I thought it ju&s;t, as I have received none &s;ince my arrival; and what I have &s;pent has been chiefly when I was on the &s;hip's duty, po&s;tage of letters, &amp;c. But your Excellen|cy don't judge it proper.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry to hear your Excellency &s;ays tis not in your power to give me a pa&s;&s;age for America. I beg of your Excellency to con&s;ider your power, and recollect that by it you had me drawn from the &s;hip the Hon. Congre&s;s had entru&s;ted me with, and that you gave and left it to my accu&s;er, who is accu&s;ed by Capt. Cottineau, in a letter you have had in your own hands; recollect too, if you plea&s;e, that I have &s;hown you my commi&s;&s;ion and naturalization in America, where I mu&s;t be judged. If your Ex|cellency will not procure me a pa&s;&s;age for going there, I mu&s;t at lea&s;t give you my humble thanks for your advice upon the many ve&s;&s;els you &s;ay are bound to America.</P>

<P N="3">3dly. It was then, and it is &s;till his Excellency's duty to have the Alliance's officers and crew, paid their prize-money, by Mr. le Ray de Chaumont, &s;ince upon a reque&s;t of &s;ome concerned in fitting out the Bon-homme Richard, &amp;c. he had lent the Alliance, with her of|ficers and crew, to them, and had ordered the prizes to be delivered to &s;aid Mr. le Ray de Chaumont, or his corre&s;pondents.</P>

<PB N="94" REF="018549_0094_0FA7ADCE779AECA0">
which (as well as I remember, the minute of that letter being lo&s;t) I acquainted him that I pre|ferred to &s;ee another command the Frigate Alliance, rather than to continue in her with &s;uch officers as tho&s;e, and I acquainted thereof, likewi&s;e, M. le Ray de Chaumont, as being his agent; but by his Excellency's order to Capt. Jones, a court of honor was held at l'Orient, in order to judge between the officers and me, who&s;e report to Capt. Jones was, that the officers had no &s;ufficient roa&s;ons to complain again&s;t me; which report I &s;uppo&s;e Capt. Jones tran&s;mit|ted to his Excellency; if he did not, I told him of it, and that the Fir&s;t and Second-Lieutenants having left the &s;hip on the 17th June, 1779, the other officers had behaved better the la&s;t cruize, and therefore the &s;ame cau&s;e was extant no longer, which his Excellency knew very well; but he gra&s;ped at any thing to ju&s;tify his taking &s;aid command from me; and what proves more the incon&s;i&s;tency of what he &s;ays, with his judgment, is that if the officers had had any rea&s;ons to complain again&s;t me, it would have given &s;till more force to their certifi|cate, of my good conduct during the engagement of the 23d Sept. His Excellency &s;ays, that <HI>I never gave the lea&s;t intimation of a wi&s;h to return to the Alliance during the four months I had been in Paris;</HI> though all my conver&s;ation with him implied it, being on that topic, and which is expre&s;&s;ed in &s;everal of my letters to him, a&s;king him by what right he had took the command of the Alliance, and kept it from me, by giving it to Capt. Jones. Moreover, it was his own duty (&s;ince he had ordered me to leave her to come to Paris, where he kept me by his orders) to order me to go back to my office on board of her. His Excellency &s;ays, with the &s;ame a&s;|&s;urance, that <HI>I made the demand of being re-placed in that &s;hip, when I knew &s;he was ju&s;t on the point of &s;ailing;</HI> though three months after, when I re&s;umed my command of her, &s;he was far from being ready to &s;ail. His Excellency &s;ays that, perhaps, my demand is chiefly made to obtain a refu&s;al, which may be of &s;ervice to me in America; and after having &s;aid a parcel of things, as the opinion he formed of me, he proceeds and &s;ays, I may burn it; what a paradox! for if I had burnt it, it could not be of any &s;ervice to me in America; indeed, I &s;uppo&s;e, he made &s;aid refu&s;al, as he did, on purpo&s;e that I might be a&s;hamed to &s;hew it, and would burn it; but as it was made thus by him, and the rea&s;on why he made it thus, may be &s;een through better than it can be explained. I am very far from being a&s;hamed to &s;hew it, but I &s;hould be, if it had been made by any man le&s;s partial than his Excellency.&mdash;His Excellency &s;ays, he thinks me &s;o imprudent, &s;o litigious, and quarrel&s;ome, &amp;c. if his Excellency means that I was imprudent in taking the command of the &s;hip Flamand, and brought her to America, up|on his bare word, that I &s;hould receive twelve thou&s;and livres therefor, as &s;oon as arrived there; if he means that I was imprudent to come from Holland to Paris, on his promi&s;e of ju&s;tice; if he means that I was imprudent to deliver to him the orders he had given me to &s;tay in Paris, which he kept, and gave me only a certificate therefor, he is right; his Excellency is al&s;o right, if he means by litigious, that I would not obey Capt. Jones's verbal orders, in preferrence to tho&s;e I had received from his Excellency; if he means that I found and proved that which he had told me was not as he had &s;aid, but quite the contrary; if he means that again&s;t his intention and others, I gave him &s;o many authentic proofs of my good conduct before, during and after the engagement, on the 23d 1779: if he means that I proved Capt. Jones and abettors' charges again&s;t me, were groundle&s;s; and moreover, the bad conduct of Capt. Jones, all along, he is right.&mdash;His Excellency is right, if he means by quarrel&s;ome, that I feel and re&s;ent any in&s;ult done to me by men who have any principle, and a&s;k &s;atisfaction of tho&s;e, but when they have no honor, and refu&s;e it, I de&s;pi&s;e and overlook them.&mdash;His Excellency &s;ays, tho&s;e things are the opinion he formed of me, but if his opinions proceed from his mind, and his mind is bad, I cannot help it, but will not be judged by his opinion only, as there are im|partial

Jones, who is really accu&s;ed by me and others.&mdash;His Excellency &s;ays that the &s;ame temper which excluded me from the French marine, would have weight with him. What does he mean by that? does he want to give me al&s;o a bad cha|racter whil&s;t I was in the French &s;ervice, upon no more ground than he has done in the Ame|rican one? I defy him and any other who&s;oever, to prove any thing again&s;t my official, public or private character, during the time I was in the French &s;ervice, before or after; I have no good foundation to &s;ay as much of him, and &s;hould be afraid to be really proved imprudent, if I did; but I was never excluded the French &s;ervice, as is proved by the King's certificate hereafter; and the French Mini&s;ter's indirect offers, I have given heretofore, and others I will give hereafter, to make me return from the American &s;ervice into the French one.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. His Excellency &s;ays that <HI>he is a&s;&s;ured I have two good qualities as Captain of a mer|chant &s;hip, oeconomy and integrity.</HI> I always thought either were very e&s;&s;ential to be in a Cap|tain of man-of-war, or I could or would never have accepted &s;uch a command; and both more nece&s;&s;ary &s;till on board a republic one, becau&s;e if I am not mi&s;taken, oeconomy &s;aves the repub|lic's property; be&s;ides, in his Excellency's letter to me at <HI>Bre&s;t, Feb.</HI> 10<HI>th, he recommended to me to be very moderate in my demands for re&s;itting the Alliance;</HI> and in an&s;wer to my demands of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, to refit her; in his letter al&s;o at <HI>Bre&s;t, March</HI> 4<HI>th,</HI> he &s;aid, I am afraid you will contrive to make &s;uch expences, that being unable to pay. I &s;hall be obliged to &s;ell the Alliance, and therefore oeconomy was recommended by him to me, which he cannot blame in a Captain of man-of-war, without being incon&s;i&s;tant with him&s;elf. Integrity, if he was capa|ble to conceive it, as I do, implies ju&s;tice and honor, which are mo&s;t requi&s;ite in a Captain of man-of-war, and particularly in a Captain of a free people, more than in any other, as there are a number of freemen under the Captain, who is inve&s;ted with all powers whatever, legi&s;la|lative, military juri&s;prudence, &amp;c. &amp;c. until his return to his country, when and where he is accountable for the u&s;e he has made of &s;uch exten&s;ive a power, before his &s;uperiors and peers&punc; therefore an arbitrary or tyrannical man ought to be excluded from &s;uch office, and a man of integrity, preferred to him.

<P>Seeing that I could expect neither ju&s;tice, redre&s;s, pa&s;&s;age to America, pay, nor prize-money, from his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, E&s;q, I left Paris, and went to l'Orient.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as arrived there, I went to pay my vi&s;it to Mr. Thevenard, Commander of the harbour, at that time; he told me if I had a mind to have the command of the &s;hip of war, Serapis (which had been brought into that harbour) he would help me to obtain it; I repre&s;en|ted to him I could not, as I was in the American navy, and that charges again&s;t my conduct in that &s;ervice, having been publi&s;hed in the papers, the command of the Alliance taken from me, my only wi&s;h then was to go to America, to ju&s;tify my&s;elf on all accounts whatever, before tho&s;e that had entru&s;ted &s;aid command to me; he replied, as to what was printed again&s;t you and made public, it is ea&s;y to mend it by having your ju&s;tification, and as much prai&s;e in your favor printed in the &s;ame paper; but if you go to America for ju&s;tice, it will be ea&s;y for tho&s;e who have prevailed, to have the Alliance taken from you, by their influence, to have you al&s;o &s;acrificed there; I &s;aid I expected more ju&s;tice there, than that came to, but even if it proved &s;o, it was my duty to go there, at all event.</P>
<P>Some days after, during my &s;econd vi&s;it to Mr. Thevenard, he was more explicit, and told me that if I would have the command of the Serapis, I might, as he had it in his hand; it was his words; meaning, I &s;uppo&s;e, that he was empowered by the French navy's Mini&s;ter, to give it me; my an&s;wer was &s;imilar to the one I made on my fir&s;t vi&s;it, and that I mu&s;t go to America: he replied, I could not go there, as I &s;hould be prevented, and that all my &s;teps were watched; I turned it into a joke, a&s;king him if his &s;pies had reported to him, whether I kept bad company or not; he &s;aid he was convinced I kept no bad one, but that I &s;hould not go to America; I told him that he might do his duty, in his &s;ervice, in preventing me, and that I would do my utmo&s;t in the American one, in order to go there.</P>
<P>The King's certificate is an evident and undeniable proof that I was not excluded the French &s;ervice, as hinted in his Excellency's letter, and the offer of Mr. Thevenard is a new &s;emi-proof that I was wanted to return in it. Moreover, it may be ob&s;erved, that all the precautions were taker to prevent my coming to America, my enemies fearing that I would obtain ju&s;tice there.</P>
<P>On my arrival at l'Orient, the officers te&s;tified to me the de&s;ire they had that I would re&s;ume my command on board the Alliance. And her former crew which had &s;erved under my order, &s;wore loudly, in the &s;treets, they would never &s;ail on board &s;aid Frigate, under any other Captain but me.</P>

<P>I have been waiting ever &s;ince I came to l'Orient, for your order to me, to take the command of the Alliance, thinking you could have reflected how &s;he was taken from me. I &s;hould look upon my|&s;elf culpable to remain a tame &s;pectator, while my authority on board her is u&s;urped by another, &s;ince I have been placed to that command by a re&s;olve of the honorable Congre&s;s. It appears to me upon con&s;ideration, that nothing can authori&s;e your Excellency to this proceeding of di&s;placing me; I am per&s;uaded that even the Congre&s;s them&s;elves would never pretend to exerci&s;e a power &s;o arbitrary as to overthrow their officers without tryal, were their rea&s;ons ever &s;o well founded, much le&s;s upon a parcel of &s;candalous charges, invented to cover the ignorance and mi&s;behaviour of a man who would &s;acrifice the reputation of the officers and men of a whole fleet, to e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I con&s;ider it my duty to return to my &s;tation on board her; I know of nothing that I have done that can ju&s;tify your detaining me from this; I am re&s;pon&s;ible to them that entru&s;ted the &s;hip to my charge, to return her to them again. If you have any expre&s;s authority for depriving me of my command, I mu&s;t beg a copy of it, and will pay due obedience to it; otherwi&s;e I mu&s;t con&s;ider my&s;elf as Captain of the &s;hip, and I beg that Dr. Franklin will not encourage any body to interfere with me in my duty, but give me all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power.</P>
<P>It appears moreover that I am con&s;idered as Captain of the Alliance, by the Admiralty-office of the United States, by the letter which I have the honor to enclo&s;e your Excellency a copy, (<HI>as the above letter</HI>) I mu&s;t beg a &s;peedy an&s;wer to this, and if your Excellency is determined to withold me from my &s;tation, you mu&s;t be an&s;werable for any di&s;agreeable con&s;equences that may take place, which I would wi&s;h to avoid.</P>

<P>"You tell me you have been drawn out of your &s;hip, that you have not been &s;u&s;pended or put under any arre&s;t by any &s;uperior officer, that you have not &s;een or known of any order of the Honorable the Continental Congre&s;s, to dive&s;t you of your continuing in the command of their &s;hip Alliance, and that an officer in the commi&s;&s;ion of Congre&s;s, has a&s;&s;umed the command of her, you do not know by what right, and that his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> has not furni&s;hed you with a copy of any orders he may have received from Congre&s;s, entitling him to di&s;mi&s;s you, and to appoint another officer to command her, though you have repeatedly applied to him for them, and for his direction for you to go on board of the &s;hip he ordered you out of.</P>

<P>I a&s;ked the officers formerly belonging to the Bon-homme Richard, whether the acknow|ledged me to be the only lawful Captain of the Alliance; they an&s;wered they had &s;hipped with P.

<P>I in&s;tantly wrote, to the Commander of the harbour, to the Commander of the road, and to Capt Jones, each a letter, acquainting them that I had re&s;umed my command on board the Alliance; Capt. Jones only refu&s;ed to receive my letter.</P>

<P>On the 18th in&s;tant, being ready to &s;ail, I &s;ent a letter to acquaint the Commanding officer upon the road, I &s;hould go out of the harbour as &s;oon as the wind would permit. I &s;ent like|wi&s;e one to Mr. de Thevenard, to a&s;k him to &s;end me a pilot: at the &s;ame time the &s;ignal for the want of a pilot was hoi&s;ted, and a gun fired. About eighty men belonging formerly to the Bon-homme Richard, but &s;ince &s;ix months had made part of the Alliance's crew, being paid and fed as &s;uch, were &s;ent for by Capt. Jones; I refu&s;ed to deliver them, having none to re|place them; &s;aid people mutined, and refu&s;ed to do any duty whatever on board, wherefore I ordered them to be put in irons. On the &s;ame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay Me&s;&s;'rs Moylan and Jonathan Williams came on board to bring me a letter, they &s;aid, from Dr. Franklin, but in&s;i&s;ted that, as the direction was to Peter Landais, formerly Captain of the Alliance, I &s;hould expre&s;s the &s;ame words; I offered to open the letter, &s;how them the date and &s;ignature in it, and give a receipt, mentioning whom it came from, and on what date, but they would not, and carried it back.</P>
<P>On the 20th in&s;tant, the wind S. W. calm, I ordered in the evening to unmoor and me warped down the Frigate; at day-break, being two mu&s;ket-&s;hots off Port Louis's citidal, the wind beginning to blow fre&s;h, we came at an anchor. In the afternoon, many boats came down from l'Orient, with cables and anchors, and made a boom acro&s;s the entry of the harbour, ju&s;t below the Alliance. I had intelligence that Capt. Jones had obtained the fitting out of a row-galley, with many boats, loaded with &s;oldiers, in order to come, board, and &s;urprize the Alli|ance in the night: in the evening I &s;ent a letter to the Commander of the citadel, to de&s;ire him to have the entry of the harbour open, that the Alliance might go out: he gave no an&s;wer: About 9 o'clock, P. M. I perceived the row-galley, in the dark, coming down, as I had heard, an hour before, one of the Bon-homme Richard's men, who was in irons, with the re&s;t of them, &s;ay to the others, that they would &s;oon be free, and I &s;hould not live in two hours time; as the Gunner had brought me word of their threats, on that account; as I thought I had &s;trong rea|&s;on of &s;u&s;pecting the Captain of marines, to be in Capt. Jones plot, I ordered tho&s;e men of the Bon-homme Richard to be put between decks, and divided the officers and men all along the &s;hip; the latter armed with pikes, with order to prevent any body who would offer to
<PB N="103" REF="018549_0103_0FA7AC58ABAA2D48">
come on board; I drew my &s;word, took a &s;peaking-trumpet, and went on the foreca&s;tle; I &s;ent word to the Captain of marines to deliver &s;ome mu&s;kets to the crew, but he would not; I went off my&s;elf and a&s;ked him why he refu&s;ed to obey my orders; he replied, he had his marines under arms, and they were enough: as I knew that one Serjeant and &s;everal of the marines had already received, on &s;hore, &s;ome money by Capt. Jones's direction, and, may be, a great many others, I had no great tru&s;t in any of the marines under Capt. Parke; I went to open the arm-che&s;ts, but &s;aw a quantity of mu&s;kets, with bayonets ready fixed, &s;tanding up at the end of the che&s;t; I told the people to take them and di&s;per&s;e all along the &s;hip: this increa&s;ed &s;till my &s;u&s;picion, as I conjectured tho&s;e mu&s;kets were there ready in order to arm the Bon-homme Richard's people, who could have ea&s;ily got out of irons, had I not ordered them &s;ecretly to be put between decks: almo&s;t convinced of Capt. Parke's treachery, by his denial to have mu&s;|kets delivered as I had ordered, I told him to take care how he &s;hould behave: and I told Mr. Blodget, a&s;ide, to run him through, if he proved undutiful and a traitor. I went again for|ward, the galley coming down very &s;ilently, when at two mu&s;ket-&s;hots di&s;tance, I hailed her; as &s;oon as they heard my voice, finding I was not kept down to read a pack of letters that Capt. Parke had received, and attempted to make me read a quarter of an hour before; they came at anchor, and undertook nothing, hearing me upon deck all night. The next morning they took off the boom, and having weighed the anchor, we drove out with the tide, paying away of a haw&s;er, fa&s;tened to a mooring; and aboat 9 o'clock, A. M. came at anchor, and moored about two miles South We&s;t of the citidel of Port Louis.</P>

<SALUTE>"SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"The re&s;olution you declared ye&s;terday of not &s;ailing 'til the prize-money was paid, has given me &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s, as well on your account as on that of the public, that I cannot help &s;tating to you on paper my rea&s;ons for thinking you ought not to delay &s;ailing one moment after the wind will permit.</P>
<P>"It is manife&s;t, from the expre&s;s order &s;ent for the immediate return of the Frigate, that &s;he is wanted in America; and &s;he contains &s;o valuable a cargo, that every moment's delay, or unnece&s;&s;ary ri&s;que of it, is a public injury; when the attainment of what your are waiting for is &s;o far di&s;tant and uncertain, even in your own opinion, that you might make a voyage to America and return again, before there is a probability of the matter being decided. I &s;uppo&s;e the &s;hip and cargo under your care, are of two millions value to the public: your &s;tay, e&s;pecially in &s;uch an expo&s;ed &s;ituation, ri&s;ques the&s;e for a precarious expectation of fifty thou&s;and; add to this, that the former is a public, the latter a private object, which &s;hould never be preferred. It is certainly very laudable in you to endeavour to have ju&s;tice done to the officers and men under your command; but it is as a&s;&s;uredly culpable to &s;acri|fice the e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts of the public to that pur&s;uit, nor will any thing ju&s;tify an officer for di&s;obey|ing his orders, but the impo&s;&s;ibility of executing them.</P>
<P>"The de&s;ire of the officers and crew to return to their native country, prevails at pre&s;ent over the wi&s;h of obtaining their prize-money; but who can an&s;wer how long that di&s;po&s;ition will continue? If you &s;tay here, you mu&s;t let them come on &s;hore and expo&s;e them to involve them&s;elves in new debts, and to be acted upon by the arts of &s;ugge&s;tions of tho&s;e who are watching every opportunity of &s;educing them and di&s;turbing the harmony on board, which will inevitably &s;oon produce ill-humour and di&s;content; upon which your enemies will contrive, in &s;pite of every precaution you can take, to improve &s;o as in|finitely to embarra&s;s, if not totally &s;top your proceedings. It is in the power of tho&s;e who wi&s;h you ill, and would be happy to &s;ee you incur blame, to delay the payment of the prize-money; and you are fur|ni&s;hing them the &s;tronge&s;t of all inducements to do this, becau&s;e they know it will delay, embarra&s;s, and bring cen&s;ure upon you: and this they may do, without its being po&s;&s;ible for you to obtain proofs of its being their fault. Thus your delay will give the plea&s;ure to your enemies of &s;aying, with every appearance of truth, that your taking the command has prevented the return of the Frigate, detained the &s;upplies, and thrown every thing into confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>"As to the ju&s;tice due to the people of the Alliance, it appears to be a &s;trange way of repairing the injuries they have &s;uffered from being detained &s;o long in Europe, and not having any prize-money; to detain them &s;till longer, and be the means of delaying the payment &s;till more: more e&s;pecially as they cannot get the payment of their wages until they return to America, and that one month's cruize upon their own coa&s;t, would not only do great &s;ervice to the public, but obtain prizes for them, of which they would be &s;ure to receive the profits, all which they lo&s;e by waiting here in expectation of that which it is not rea&s;onable to expect.</P>

<P>"Your Excellency well knows, that I ever avoided interfering with the officers or directions of any of the continental &s;hips in Europe, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have avoided all that has now happened, as you know I was clear of opinion la&s;t year, that all the ve&s;&s;els that appeared to be continental in this harbour la&s;t June and July, &s;hould have directly proceeded to the relief of the country, who&s;e flag they hoi&s;ted; excepting your Excellency and the Captains of &s;uch &s;hips, had po&s;itive orders to &s;end them on other cruizes, and as a farther proof, you know I at the &s;ame time offered to go with all the State-officers under my directions, as volunteers in that fleet then fitting out here, if going to America; this I &s;ay proves I did not &s;eek to interfere with continental officers; but, Sir, whenever I am officially cal|led on for my opinion, I &s;hould be wanting in my duty, did I neglect giving it; I therefore gave it as per enclo&s;ed copy, as an officer and as a citizen of America; and &s;o clear I am in it, that I &s;hall trouble the Continental Congre&s;s with a relation of all I do in this and every of any bu&s;ine&s;s in Europe, and &s;hall al&s;o reque&s;t the Governor of the State, under who&s;e particular direction I am, to lay my conduct, in this matter, regularly before Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>"If I have erred in this opinion, it can only proceed from being ignorant of any orders Congre&s;s has &s;ent to Capt. Landais, to deliver up the Alliance to you, to appoint another Captain, becau&s;e as Capt. Landais has a po&s;itive order from Congre&s;s, for the command of the Alliance, and that the Admiralty or Navy-Board, &s;till addre&s;s Capt. Landais as Captain of the Alliance; he and all pro|per officers in the &s;ervice, mu&s;t conceive it to be his duty, to take care of his &s;hip; your Excellency may, therefore, I pre&s;ume, ea&s;ily rectify this di&s;pute, by complying with what every officer has a right to demand, before he obeys, that is, by your directing any per&s;on whom you nominate to &s;uper&s;ede Capt. Landais, as al&s;o to the next officer on board the Alliance, whenever your officer goes on board to take the command, the Fir&s;t-Lieutenant of that &s;hip &s;hould &s;ee that order; this, Sir, is u&s;ual in all &s;er|vices, el&s;e any man might go on board of any &s;hip, and take the command of her.</P>
<P>"I hope your Excellency will do me the ju&s;tice to believe that all my conduct herein proceeds from no other motive but a true regard to the country I ever will revere, and from ju&s;tice that is due to every officer in our &s;ervice, and becau&s;e I am called on officially in this unhappy bu&s;ine&s;s which I con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eive is in your power to redre&s;s, in a few words, by furni&s;hing Capt.

<P>By the above letter given by an American officer, the only one acquainted with the &s;ea &s;er|vice, to be con&s;ulted in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, it was undeniably and fully proved to his Excellency that he could not take nor keep from me the command of the Frigate Alliance, without break|ing all laws, making an abu&s;e of the power he was entru&s;ted with, again&s;t a free man, and an officer, unle&s;s he could produce an order of Congre&s;s to dive&s;t me thereof: but he was unwilling to li&s;ten to ju&s;tice, rea&s;on, law, or coun&s;els, and tho&s;e could avail me nothing again&s;t his Ex|cellency's arbitrary acts to my prejudice, for he was determined thereupon, being per&s;uaded he would have, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;omebody to &s;upport him and his tyranny, in America.</P>

<P>It does not appear by the above letter, that the French Mini&s;ter had any rea&s;on there to complain again&s;t my conduct, during the time I had been on board the Alliance, nor when I was formerly in the French &s;ea &s;ervice (as his Excellency hinted in his letter to me) or he would have expre&s;&s;ed &s;omething of it; but it appears rather, that I was a &s;ubject the King did not like to part with: moreover it appears that &s;aid Mini&s;ter exculpated him&s;elf, in &s;ome degree, of having had any hand in taking the command of the Alliance from me, &s;aying, Mr. Franklin did it; be&s;ides, he appears to in&s;i&s;t that &s;aid command was given by his Excellency to Mr. Jones, as if he wanted to get rid of the latter.</P>

<SALUTE>"GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"I received your letter, dated the <HI>12</HI>th of April pa&s;t, expre&s;&s;ing that you were in nece&s;&s;itous cir|cum&s;tances, and that you were alarmed at having received neither wages nor prize-money, when the &s;hip was &s;o nearly prepared for &s;ea.</P>
<P>"Having had nothing to do with the prizes, and under&s;tanding that they could not &s;oon be turned into money, I had an&s;wered the purpo&s;e of your letter, in the be&s;t manner in my power, by advancing twenty-four thou&s;and livres, to &s;upply the mo&s;t urgent of your nece&s;&s;ities, 'till the prize-money could be obtained.</P>
<P>"With regard to your wages, I thought the expectation of having them paid here, was wrong. No body in Europe is empowered to pay them, and I believe it is a rule with all maritime &s;tates, to pay their &s;hips only at home, by an officer where the accounts are kept, and where only it can be known what agreements were made with the officers and men, what advances they have received, and what their families attornies may have received in their ab&s;ence. I had many letters and informations from l'Orient, acquainting me with the di&s;content of the people of the Alliance, at the method propo&s;ed of valuing the prizes, in order to their being paid for by the King; and that our &s;hip would not po&s;&s;i|bly be got out, unle&s;s that method was changed, and the prizes fairly &s;old at auction to the highe&s;t bid|der. I then applied to have the change made, and it was readily agreed by the Mini&s;ter of the ma|rine, that they &s;hould be &s;old: but to &s;ell them &s;uddenly, would again have been liable to objection, and therefore time was given in the adverti&s;ements, that di&s;tant purcha&s;ers of &s;hips might know of the &s;ale, and a greater number of buyers give a chance of a higher price for your benefit; had the fir&s;t me|thod been complied with, I am inclined to think, from his Maje&s;ty's known genero&s;ity, a better price would have been obtained (as &s;imilar in&s;tances have proved) than is likely to be got by the &s;ale, and you would have had your money &s;ooner: I con&s;ented to change, to &s;atisfy, and if po&s;&s;ible, plea&s;e you. The delay, was, by no means, agreeable te me, as it occa&s;ioned a great additional expence, and I heartily wi&s;hed the &s;hip in America.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="018549_0108_0FA7AC5DEE7D36F0">"I did, as you have heard, &s;end a memorial to the Court of Denmark, claiming a re&s;titution of the prizes or of their value; this memorial was received long before they &s;ailed from France; they were, neverthele&s;s, allowed to depart for England, and the only an&s;wer I have had from that Court is, that the re&s;titution was made in pur&s;uance of treaties between the two powers.</P>
<P>"I am not &s;atisfied with this an&s;wer, but have laid the whole matter before Congre&s;s, de&s;iring their in&s;tructions. You may be a&s;&s;ured that not a penny of the value has yet been paid; and that if any thing is recovered while I am concerned in the bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;trict ju&s;tice will be done you, which I have al&s;o no doubt, will be done with regard to the Serapis and Counte&s;s of Scarborough.</P>
<P>"Having received &s;everal letters from you formerly, complaining in &s;trong terms of Capt. Landais' conduct in the government of the &s;hip, and his ill treatment of all the officers, except the Pur&s;er; and having received al&s;o from Capt. Landais him&s;elf a letter, dated at l'Orient, May <HI>15, 1779,</HI> in which he &s;ays, "You all joined together again&s;t him, even before he left Bo&s;ton; that he was pro|mi&s;ed another &s;et, but being ready to &s;ail, the Navy-Board thought your behaviour would be better when at &s;ea; on the contrary it grew wor&s;e, and was come to that pitch, that he was compelled to acquaint me with it, that I might take a proper method to remedy it; and if no other was to be found he would rather chu&s;e to leave the command, than continue with &s;uch officers.&mdash;After all this, it is a little &s;urpri&s;ing to me, that Capt. Landais, who came to Paris only to vindicate him&s;elf from &s;ome charges again&s;t him, and there voluntarily, as I thought (and in pur&s;uance of his former re&s;olution) relinqui&s;hed the &s;hip, by de&s;iring me repeatedly to give an order for taking out of her the things he had on board; and who never once, during all the time he &s;taid here, expre&s;&s;ed the lea&s;t wi&s;h, or gave the lea&s;t hint of a de&s;ire to be continued in her, 'till he heard &s;he was upon the point of &s;ailing; and now that he could demand to be placed over you, and that you &s;hould wi&s;h to be again under his com|mand &mdash;I know not how to account for this change.&mdash;But having agreed to what I imagined from the letters on both &s;ides, would be agreeable to both you and Capt. Landais, and placed another Captain in the &s;hip, I cannot now comply with your reque&s;t. I have related exactly to Congre&s;s the manner of his leaving that &s;hip, and though I declined any judgement of his manoeuvres in the Frigate, I have given it as my opinion, after examining the affair, that it was not all likely either that he &s;hould given orders to fire into the Bon-homme Richard, or that his officers would have obeyed &s;uch orders if he had given them. Thus I have taken what care I could of your honor in that particular; you will therefore excu&s;e me, if I am a little concerned for it in another. If it &s;hould come to be publicly known, that you had the &s;tronge&s;t aver&s;ion to Capt. Landais, who had u&s;ed you ba&s;ely, and that is only &s;ince the la&s;t year's cruize, and the appointment of Commodore Jones to the command, that you reque&s;t to be again under your old Captain, I fear &s;u&s;picions and reflections may be thrown upon you by the world, as if this change of &s;entiment mu&s;t have ari&s;en from your ob|&s;ervations during that cruize, that Capt. Jones loved clo&s;e fighting, and that Capt. Landais was &s;kilful in keeping out of harm's way, and that therefore you thought your&s;elves &s;afer with the latter. For my&s;elf, I believe you to be brave men, and lovers of your country and its glorious cau&s;e; and I am per&s;uaded you have only been ill advi&s;ed, and mi&s;led by the artful and malicious mi&s;repre&s;entations of &s;ome per&s;ons I gue&s;s at.&mdash;Take in good part this friendly coun&s;el of an old man, who is your friend.&mdash; Go home peaceably with your &s;hip: do your duty faithfully and cheerfully: behave re&s;pectfully to your Commander, and I am per&s;uaded he will do the &s;ame to you. Thus you will not only be happier in your voyage, but recommend your&s;elves to the future favours of Congre&s;s, and to the e&s;teem of your country.</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="109" REF="018549_0109_0FA7AC5EB1E21C70">The officers received the foregoing letter only, June 18th 1780, by which it appears that it was antidated, to prove his Excellency's readine&s;s to give them money.</P>
<P>If his Excellency had been really willing to let the Alliance's officers and crew have &s;ome of their prize-money, he might have done it &s;ooner, as the two prize-brigs, one loaded with fi&s;h oil, the other with beef and butter, had been &s;old in France for ready money, in the pre|ceeding month of October; he hints that, previous to his an&s;wering on that account, he gene|rou&s;ly had advanced twenty-four thou&s;and livres, to &s;upply the mo&s;t urgent of their wants; but it appears that letter was wrote only after his Excellency knew I had re&s;umed (according to the officers and crew's invitation) my command on board the Alliance, in order to &s;ooth the officers by his liberality, to their reque&s;t, and draw their affection from me, who had nothing but my right and hone&s;ty, to offer to them, to balance his kind writing and compliance to them.</P>
<P>The money was &s;ent at the &s;ame time to the direction of Capt. Jones, who&s;e adherents made u&s;e of it to draw, I was told, every one they could, from their duty to me; and any one of tho&s;e that would not acknowledge Capt. Jones to be the lawful Captain of the Alliance, either officers or forema&s;t men, did not receive a farthing of it.</P>
<P>It may be ob&s;erved how his Excellency wants to appear ready, in order to plea&s;e the officers and crew, to &s;ell the prizes which had been in France five months, and could have been &s;old then, and tho&s;e officers and crew paid therefor, when he might have agreed with the French Mini&s;ter and others concerned thereupon; but in&s;tead of that, he &s;till makes u&s;e of &s;pecious rea&s;ons for retarding the &s;ale of them, and keep them from being paid for. His Excellency after a long prologue, &s;ays, that he con&s;ented to change (the way of &s;elling the prizes) to &s;atisfy and plea&s;e the officers. N. B. by which word <HI>con&s;ented,</HI> he owns it was in his power to have them &s;old any way, at any time, though he and the other concerned, had no bu&s;ine&s;s to meddle with the Serapis and Counte&s;s of Scarborough men-of-war prizes, which were wholly belonging to their conquerors, if the Bon-homme Richard had been either King or United States' ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>His Excellency is pretty explicit in the paragraph relative to the Alliance's prizes &s;ent to Bergen, &s;aying he had &s;ent him&s;elf a memorial to the Court of Denmark about them (though he &s;aid in the &s;econd paragraph he had had nothing to do with the prizes, but he does not &s;ay as much with regard to their produce) But there is another ob&s;ervation to be made about his Excellency's &s;ending him&s;elf a memorial, claiming tho&s;e prizes from the Court of Denmark, as if the Bon-homme Richard and the Vengeance had been King's ve&s;&s;els, having an appear|ance of right to claim a &s;hare in the prize-&s;hip Union; the French Mini&s;ter's memorial to claim that prize in the King's name, would have had more weight then with that Court, than the United States' Mini&s;ter. The United States' independence, being yet unacknowledged by that Court; therefore his Excellency writing &s;aid memorial to that Court, corroborates with his let|ter to Commodore Gillon, that the Bon-homme Richard, &amp;c. (were not King's &s;hips but pri|vateers) belonging to concerned. Moreover, his Excellency, even by that paragraph and others, is bound for the prize &s;hare to the Alliance's company.</P>
<P>In the paragraph wherein his Excellency &s;ays, that a year before the officers of the Alliance had complained again&s;t me, then in &s;trong terms; he does not &s;ay they ever complained again&s;t me &s;ince that time, becau&s;e at that time the Fir&s;t and Second-Lieutenants having left her, the others were all pretty quiet. It may be ob&s;erved, that his Excellency knew tho&s;e two Lieutenants had left the &s;hip, &s;ince he directed the foregoing letter to Lieut. Degge, who was the year before only Third-Lieutenant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> moreover, he knew that all the officers and crew had lately wrote to him to rein&s;tate me Captain of the Alliance, as the only lawful one of her: on the other hand, his Excellency rehear&s;e the purport of my letter, dated May 15, 1779, the only one in which I com|plained again&s;t the officers undutifulne&s;s; but &s;ince that time no letter either &s;ide had been
<PB N="110" REF="018549_0110_0FA7AC5F6CE681C0">
wrote on the &s;ame &s;ubject, con&s;equently he had no rea&s;on then to deprive me of my command on that account. But it appears to me, that his Excellency having exhau&s;ted all his &s;kill to take the command of the Alliance from me, and give it to Capt. Jones; knowing that he could never find any good rea&s;on to ju&s;tify his conduct therein, he wrote to the officers that he had &s;ent them &s;ome money to &s;ooth them fir&s;t, after he reminded tho&s;e of the animo&s;ity they had again&s;t me a year before, and how, word by word, I had complained again&s;t them, to rai&s;e it again; both which inducements might have prevailed upon their minds, and made them prefer the money and Capt. Jones, to me; was it wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice, and duty in a Mini&s;ter, to write thus to officers, in order to rai&s;e their jealou&s;y again&s;t their Captain, I leave it to be judged, and whether it is not owing to that letter to the officers, that they aro&s;e, and the whole crew afterwards, again&s;t Congre&s;s's orders and mine?</P>
<P>How his Excellency mi&s;repre&s;ents the fact, &s;aying that I went to Paris, &amp;c. he does not &s;ay he wrote me to go there, but hints I went on my own accord; he does not &s;ay neither that he gave me an order to &s;tay there, fearing I would go back on board the Alliance, in Holland, and that he kept me thus there, about four months; he rather gives to under&s;tand that I relinqui&s;h|ed my command, all which is proved fal&s;e by my letters to him; he pretends I a&s;ked only for my things; but he does not &s;ay it was long after Capt. Jones had the command of the Alliance; be&s;ides, his Excellency knew it was in obedience to his letter to me in Holland, that I went to him in Paris, where he kept me by his order, and where it was his duty to give me another order to go and take my command, even if I had never &s;poke to him about it, as I did. His Excellency pretends I never hinted the lea&s;t de&s;ire, during the time I was in Paris, to be con|tinued in that &s;hip, but when I knew &s;he was on the point of &s;ailing: he does not mention at what time I claimed of him my command, wanting to make under&s;tand that I never did it before I was in l'Orient, as the Alliance had never, &s;ince her la&s;t arrival there, been on the point of &s;ailing, until after I re&s;umed my command on board of her, as he &s;ays, <HI>and that now he &s;hould demand to be placed over you, and that you &s;hould wi&s;h to be again under his command;&mdash;I know not how to account for this change:</HI> wherein he expre&s;&s;es the word now, as if I had never before mentioned any thing about it; and he did not forget to make them &s;en&s;ible I demanded to be placed <HI>over them,</HI> and they wi&s;hed to be again under my command, I &s;uppo&s;e, to rai&s;e their jealou&s;y again again&s;t me. But a &s;triking ob&s;ervation may be made here, which is, if his Ex|cellency was fully per&s;uaded of the e&s;&s;ential prejudice and animo&s;ity of the Alliance's officers again&s;t me, their certificates of the &s;ketch and relation of the engagement on the 23d Sept. 1779, to ju&s;tify my good conduct, had &s;o much the more force, being given by my enemies.&mdash;His Ex|cellency &s;ays, that <HI>he had agreed to what he imagined from the letters on both &s;ides, would be a|greeable to both the officers and me.</HI> He knew the &s;ame cau&s;e did not exi&s;t for a year pa&s;t, there|fore there was no rea&s;on remaining then therefor: moreover, if his Excellency, out of complai|&s;ance, did conde&s;cend to the officers wi&s;hes and mine, made a year before, why did not his Ex|cellency likewi&s;e conde&s;cend to the then wi&s;hes of the Alliance's officers, crew and mine, in re|e&s;tabli&s;hing me in the command of the Alliance, which would have agreed with my right to it, ju&s;|tice and the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s thereabout? and why did he prefer to keep Capt. Jones in that command, though accu&s;ed, and again&s;t all right! let his Excellency account for it. But his Excellency &s;ays, <HI>he has related exactly to Congre&s;s, the manner of my leaving that &s;hip.</HI> I &s;hould be very curious to know how he had related to Congre&s;s, I had left her: But I may &s;ay with exactne&s;s, I left her in a &s;imilar manner as I had commanded her; that is, having be|fore delivered a li&s;t of the articles &s;he wanted, to be refitted, to Mr. Neuville; having a&s;ked of Capt. Jones part of her crew he kept by force, on board the Serapis, which he refu&s;ed to re|turn, though he knew the quantity of her &s;ick people, and the number of pri&s;oners on board to
<PB N="111" REF="018549_0111_0FA7AC6031FA47F0">
be guarded, all which prevented the repair of the Alliance: When I received his Excellency's letter to me for going to Paris, I gave a written order to Mr. Degge, Fir&s;t-Lieutenant of the Alliance, to keep the command of her until my return back on board, after which I proceeded to Paris, in obedience to his Excellency; if he has not related thus my leaving that Frigate in Holland, he has not been more exact in that particular, than in others: but the reader may judge by the foregoing letter to the officers, what he was capable of writing to Congre&s;s, and others in America, again&s;t me.&mdash;His Excellency &s;ays to the officers, <HI>that he had taken care of their honor;</HI>&mdash;but after he &s;ays, <HI>if it &s;hould come to be publicly known that you had the &s;tronge&s;t aver&s;ion to Capt. Landais, who had u&s;ed you ba&s;ely, &amp;c.</HI> which is paradoxical as much as can be, for if the officers had honor to take care of by his Excellency, they having given me their authentic certificate of my good conduct, during the engagement, though they had the &s;tronge&s;t aver&s;ion to me, who had u&s;ed them (his Excellency &s;ays) <HI>ba&s;ely;</HI> it mu&s;t be acknowledged that the officers certificate was given to my good conduct, without any favour whatever and there|fore that my conduct was really good.&mdash;His Excellency's reflections and apprehen&s;ions of the public &s;u&s;picion on the cau&s;e, why the officers preferred me to Capt. Jones, for commanding the Alliance, may have taken place, becau&s;e his Excellency had per&s;uaded the &s;aid public, by his having had the fal&s;e relation of Capt. Jones (authenticated by his Excellency's name to it) printed: therefore the public might very well have been deceived by it, and believe in con|&s;equence thereof, Capt. Jones was a mighty man, and that I was a very guilty one. But his Excellency was not &s;atisfied yet, with all he had done to &s;acrifice my character in the United States' navy. He attacked it al&s;o, in his letter to me, dated Pa&s;&s;y, March 12th, 1780, in the French one: be&s;ides, his Excellency's letter to the officers, after having fir&s;t promi&s;ed them money, after &s;oothed them, tried to rai&s;e and imbitter their animo&s;ity again&s;t me; he threatens them with the public reflection on their preferring me to Capt. Jones, for Commander! but moreover and above, his Excellency does not &s;top there, he does all he can to per&s;uade al&s;o tho&s;e officers again&s;t their own &s;ight, hearing, knowledge, judgment, certificate, &s;ign, and honor, (they having been pre&s;ent with me in the engagement) of my cowardice, and of Capt. Jones's bravery, &s;aying, <HI>I fear &s;u&s;picions and reflections may be thrown upon you by the world; as if the change of &s;entiments mu&s;t have ari&s;en from your ob&s;ervations during that cruize, that Capt. Jones loved clo&s;e fighting, and that Capt. Landais was &s;kilful in keeping out of harms way, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Was all this the duty and ju&s;tice of a Mini&s;ter of a free people, of a wi&s;e, candid philantro|phos and philo&s;opher, was it prudent and politic in him to alienate, rai&s;e the animo&s;ity, ha|tred, un&s;ubordination and treachery of tho&s;e officers again&s;t their &s;uperior; and was not the foregoing letter, the origin of the officers and crew ri&s;ing, &s;ix weeks after, again&s;t Congre&s;s's order! does not &s;uch a Mini&s;ter de&s;erve the contrary epithets to the name I have u&s;ed ju&s;t above: I leave to the reader to judge what his Excellency was capable of writing again&s;t me to his ad|herents; I leave to his &s;agacity to find all the unexplained blackne&s;s concealed in the foregoing letter, and formers to me: and al&s;o to judge his Excellency's and Capt. Jones's conduct towards me.</P>
<P>On the 4th July, 1780, Thomas Elick, one of the Alliance's Boat&s;wain's-mate, told me he had received five French guineas, of Mr. Dale, upon promi&s;e that he would do his utmo&s;t to bring the crew to a re&s;olution to claim and e&s;tabli&s;h Capt. Jones, Commander of the Frigate Alliance; and that he was al&s;o directed to tran&s;mit a pack of letters (which he delivered to me) to the forema&s;t men of &s;aid Frigate: which was directed, <HI>To the &s;hip's company of the American Frigate Alliance, at anchor in the road of Grava, in France,</HI> and under Capt.

Landais,</HI> is re&s;tored to them, or to that effect. This mu|tiny has undoubtedly been excited by that Captain, probably by making them believe that &s;atisfaction has been received for tho&s;e Norway prizes delivered up to the Engli&s;h, which GOD knows, is not true; the Court of Denmark not having yet re&s;olved to give us a &s;hilling on that account. That he is concerned in this mutiny, he has been fooli&s;h enough to furni&s;h us with proofs; the &s;ailors letter be|ing not only enclo&s;ed under a cover, directed to me in his hand writing, but he has al&s;o, in the &s;ame writing, interlined the words <HI>their legal Captain P. Landais,</HI> which happen to contain his &s;ig|nature. I went immediately to Ver&s;ailles to demand the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of government; and on &s;howing the letter by which his guilt plainly appeared, an order was immediately granted, and &s;ent away the &s;ame evening, for apprehending and impri&s;oning him; and orders were given at the &s;ame time to the Commi&s;&s;ary of the Port, to afford you all kind of a&s;&s;i&s;tance: we thought it be&s;t, at the &s;ame time, to give directions that tho&s;e &s;ailors who have &s;igned this letter, &s;hould not be favoured with receiving any part of the money ordered to be advanced, unle&s;s to &s;uch as expre&s;s their &s;orrow for having been &s;o mi&s;led, and willingne&s;s to do their duty; and that they may be known, this letter was &s;ent down to Mr. de Monplai&s;ir; but care &s;hould be taken that it be returned, as it contains the proofs above-menti|oned again&s;t Landais, who will be tried for his life, being con&s;idered by the Mini&s;ters as an emigrant, without the King's permi&s;&s;ion, and therefore &s;till a Frenchman.

</LETTER>
<P>By the letter number one from his Excellency Benjamin Franklin to Capt. Jones, it ap|pears, that his Excellency was to direct me as the lawful Captain of the Alliance, to put in execution, with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, the orders of the Board of Admiralty for the return of the Alliance, contained in the extract of the letter from the Board of Admiralty to his Excel|lency Benjamin Franklin, number two. And it was evident by that extract that the Alliance was ordered to go to Philadelphia.&mdash;By the leter from his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, number three, dated Pa&s;&s;y, June 7, 1780, to the Honorable Captain Landais, late Commander of the Alliance, it appears that it was a copy of the letter which Me&s;&s;i'rs Williams and Moy|lon would not deliver to me, unle&s;s I gave them a receipt for it, in which they wanted me to in&s;ert, that I was <HI>late Commander of the Alliance,</HI> which I refu&s;ed to do, and they carried the letter back; it appears further that his Excellency had &s;ent &s;aid copy to Capt. Jones; that letter is deviced and wrote, like all his Excellency's other letters to me, with the &s;ame arbitrary abu&s;e of power and mi&s;repre&s;entations, therefore I leave the propriety of impropriety of it to be judged by the reader as well as the other; number four, which I received and gave a receipt for;&mdash;in the letter number five, from his Excellency Benjamin Franklin to Capt. Jones, dated Pa&s;&s;y, June 12, 1780, his Excellency &s;hows his art, his &s;orrow and anger, for being di&s;|appointed after all the inju&s;tice he had done to me, for taking and keeping &s;aid command from me, to give it to Capt. Jones; his Excellency charges me of guilt of which he and Capt. Jones are the only guilty, and pretends it is a mutiny to take my lawful command, taken from me by encroachment and u&s;urpation. <HI>And he threatens that I &s;hall be tried for my life, as an emigrant, by the Mini&s;ter, without the King's permi&s;&s;ion</HI> (and his Excellency &s;ays) and therefore &s;till a Frenchman, and all that pretended pro&s;ecution made again&s;t my life, as it appears exacted from the French Mini&s;ter, <HI>by his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, Mini&s;ter Plenipotentiary of the United States,</HI> in France, who&s;e ab&s;olute and direct duty was to &s;upport me, being naturalized in America, but after all that he had done, there is no wonder that he overlooked this immedi|ate
<PB N="115" REF="018549_0115_0FA7AC64D1E69C70">
part of his duty as well as others.&mdash;The letter number &s;ix, from his Excellency Benja+min Franklin, to the officers and &s;eamen of the Alliance Frigate, dated Ver&s;ailles, June 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 1780, was a &s;cheme to try whether he could make once more an abu&s;e of his power with them<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in order to take &s;aid command from me, and give it to Capt. Jones.</P>
<P>Number &s;even is the order of Capt. Jones to me, dated l'Orient, June 28, 1780, by which he acknowledged that I was then in actual command of the American Frigate Alliance; it may be ob&s;erved, that he wanted to make me appear again, that I was then (being at Groais I&s;land, at anchor &s;ix miles from the main land in danger to be attacked every moment by the enemies) under his order, though his Excellency had not ordered me to be &s;o, &s;ince I had re|&s;umed my command on board the Alliance. Moreover, it appears by the impropriety of the contents of Capt. Jones's order, that he wanted to expo&s;e the Frigate Alliance to the danger of being made defencele&s;s again&s;t the attack of the enemies in the road &s;he was in, where they came very often, by ordering me to &s;end him eighty of my be&s;t riggers, and all the joiners, and perhaps to &s;educe them to come and &s;urprize with others, the few people on board the Fri|gate Alliance during the night. All which papers are announced to the &s;hip's company of the Frigate Alliance, by a letter of Capt. Jones to the &s;aid &s;hip's company, inclo&s;ed al&s;o in the &s;ame cover, under the &s;eal of Capt. Jones, by which letter Capt. Jones prays &s;aid &s;hip's company to read all he &s;ends them with attention, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;By which the reader may judge how far his Excellency Benjamin Franklin and Capt. Jones agreed in their lawle&s;s principles, in calling mutiny what was lawful in the &s;hip's company in acknowledging and paying due obedience to me as Captain of the Alliance: and how they coincided in their threats and pro|mi&s;es of money, to rai&s;e undutifulne&s;s and real mutiny in &s;aid &s;hip's company, again&s;t my rightful command over them, in order to deprive me, and u&s;urp again &s;aid command in favour of Capt. Jones.</P>
