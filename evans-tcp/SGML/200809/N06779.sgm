</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ONE grand De&s;ign of the <HI>holy Scriptures</HI> is to rebuke the common Stupidity of a de|generate World, in not regarding the mighty Acts of Divine Providence; to call GOD to our Remembrance; and point our At|tention to his Agency, as the prime Efficient, the &s;overeign Moderator of all Events, whether in the na|tural or moral World.&mdash;The Book of <HI>P&s;alms,</HI> in particu|lar, is mo&s;t excellently calculated to &s;erve this important De&s;ign; e&s;pecially as Example carry's with it a peculiar Force, the mo&s;t &s;triking and attractive to human Nature. For this Part of the &s;acred Records very &s;ingularly abounds with admirable Patterns of devotional Exerci&s;es, Medita|tion, Prayer and Prai&s;e: every where confe&s;&s;ing and ador|ing GOD, in Character of the fir&s;t Cau&s;e and &s;upreme Agent, the original Creator and con&s;tant Pre&s;erver, Bene|factor, Proprietor, and Lord of all; celebrating the
<PB N="2" REF="008599_0004_102F9552B44A4AA0">
Perfections of his Being and Government; recounting the Operations of his Hand; and rendering to Him all religi|ous Honours and Acknowledgments,&mdash;many of which are in the Strain of Thank&s;giving and Ble&s;&s;ing,&mdash;which were recorded in Scripture for our In&s;truction and Imitation.</P>
<P>In the P&s;alm now before us (thought to be pen'd by <HI>Ezra,</HI> or &s;ome other Man of God, about the Time of the Jews Return from the Babyloni&s;h Captivity) we find the Church of I&s;rael avouching the Agency of GOD in the glorious Tran&s;actions and happy Revolutions of that extra|ordinary Day. They had lately &s;een very intere&s;ting and &s;urprizing Occurrences in Favour of Zion; which they contemplate with &s;acred Plea&s;ure and Wonder. It is a de|votional Admiration and Joy they expre&s;s on this mirthful Occa&s;ion; uttering their Words before the LORD, and a&s;cribing to Him the Prai&s;e of tho&s;e &s;ignal and pro&s;perous Events they were now rejoycing in. <HI>The</HI> LORD (&s;ay they) <HI>hath done great Things for us:</HI> whereof <HI>we are glad.</HI></P>
<P>Amid&s;t the pre&s;ent Tumult of different and blending Pa&s;&s;ions, betwixt melancholy Reflections and plea&s;ant Pro&s;|pects intermingling with one another, on their &s;udden e|merging out of Servitude and Sorrow, into Liberty &amp; Joy, they &s;eemed to them&s;elves <HI>like them that dream.</HI> Their former <HI>Di&s;tre&s;s</HI> was &s;o recent in every one's Memory, and had been &s;o long &amp; heavy upon them, that they &s;till &s;eem'd to feel it, and could hardly realize their actual Recovery out of it. Their pre&s;ent <HI>Enlargement</HI> was &s;o &s;udden, was attended with &s;uch wonderful Circum&s;tances, and promi&s;ed &s;uch glorious Con&s;equences, &s;uperiour to their highe&s;t and mo&s;t &s;anguine Expectations, that they were a&s;toni&s;h'd at it, and could &s;carce "believe it for Joy." As it is &s;tory'd of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> when miraculou&s;ly deliver'd out of his Impri&s;onment, "He wi&s;t not that it was <HI>true,</HI> which was done by the Angel; but thought he &s;aw a <HI>Vi&s;ion</HI>": &s;o in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, the People of God, marvellou&s;ly re&s;cued from the Oppre&s;&s;ion of the Enemy, and re&s;tored to glorious Liberty, &s;ay of them&s;elves, "We were like them that <HI>dream</HI>". They were even lo&s;t in a plea&s;ing Confu|&s;ion
<PB N="3" REF="008599_0005_102F955A3A8DCAB8">
and Amazement, to find their Mourning turned to <HI>Laughter</HI> &s;o unexpectedly, and joyful Songs &s;o &s;uddenly &s;ucceeding their Tears and Groans. Such a Revolution &s;eem'd almo&s;t incredible to them.</P>
<P>The very <HI>Pagans</HI> round about them were alarm'd, and &s;truck with Surprize, to ob&s;erve what Wonders the God of I&s;rael had wrought for his Favourite-Nation. "Then &s;aid they among the <HI>Heathen,</HI> The LORD hath done great Things for them". Such uncommon Events, and of &s;o favourable an A&s;pect, had Divine Providence effected in behalf of his People, that they became the Topic of Conver|&s;ation every where; the &s;triking News apace flew abroad, and &s;pread univer&s;al Surprize. The Heathen them&s;elves were not in&s;en&s;ible of a Divine Interpo&s;ition in this Affair; but &s;aw and confe&s;s'd the Hand of the LORD working Salva|tion for the I&s;raelites. How much &s;oever they hated the <HI>Jews,</HI> they were convinced, and could not but own, the LORD their GOD had &s;ignally appeared on their Side, and wrought Wonders for their Relief and Welfair.&mdash;Be&s;ure, the <HI>Jews</HI> them&s;elves were con&s;cious of this; and while their <HI>Pagan</HI> Neighbours made the&s;e Providential Wonders the Subject of common Talk only, the <HI>Jews</HI> acting in Character, in a ju&s;t Corre&s;pondence with their profe&s;s'd Attachment to the Service of the God of Heaven, and in Order properly to &s;ignify their Gratitude, as became a Peo|ple laid under &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hing Obligations, made the&s;e Things the Matter of their <HI>devotional</HI> Acknowledgments; and in a Way of Addre&s;s to the GOD of I&s;rael, they ut|tered the grateful Confe&s;&s;ion in our Text, "The LORD hath done great Things for us: whereof we are glad".</P>
<P>The <HI>Heathen,</HI> that &s;aw or heard of the &s;tupendous Di&s;|pen&s;ations of Providence which gave &s;uch <HI>Gladne&s;s</HI> to the Jews, might be affected in a Way of Surprize: but &s;till might conceive little <HI>Plea&s;ure,</HI> and offer no Thanks to God, on the Occa&s;ion; nay rather, from the Power of Prejudice and Super&s;tition, might give Way to invidious and indignant Pa&s;&s;ions, when they view'd the&s;e a&s;toni&s;hing Events as the Products of a &s;pecial Divine Agency in be|half
<PB N="4" REF="008599_0006_102F955C0DBB6D38">
of them who were Partakers of the Benefit; when they con&s;ider'd the&s;e Wonders as wrought, not by any of their own gods, but by the GOD of the <HI>Jews,</HI> whom, in his &s;uper-eminent Character of "the only living and true God, the Holy One of I&s;rael", they were truly Haters of; and when they con&s;ider'd the &s;ame as wrought in Fa|vour of a Nation, whom, in their Character of "a holy Nation, and the peculiar People of the mo&s;t High", the <HI>Heathen</HI> rather maligned and de&s;pi&s;ed. However, while others might be vexed at the&s;e Things, and might envy the Jews, or at be&s;t only &s;tand amazed at the&s;e great Events, the obliged People them&s;elves, con&s;cious of their being highly favoured of the Lord, took <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> therein, and devoutly confe&s;&s;ed GOD the Author of them; &s;aying, "The LORD hath done great Things for us: whereof we are <HI>glad</HI>".</P>
<P>As Chearfulne&s;s is u&s;ually expre&s;s'd by Songs, and Thank&s;giving is the proper Language of Joy, on the Re|ceipt of Divine Benefits, they expre&s;&s;ed the <HI>Gladne&s;s</HI> of their Hearts in an Addre&s;s of <HI>Thanks,</HI> a Hymn of <HI>Prai&s;e;</HI> which is handed down to us in the in&s;pired Records. It is one of the "Songs of Zion", in which the Words of our Text occur. The People of God had been "&s;owing in Tears", but were now "reaping in Joy": And their pre|&s;ent <HI>Rejoycing</HI> was "after a godly &s;ort", as we may pre|&s;ume their antecedent <HI>Sorrowing</HI> had been. They "walk|ed mournfully before the Lord", while "their Harps hung on the Willows", untuned to "&s;ing the Lord's Song" in their &s;uffering State. But upon their Deliverance they "awaked up their Glory, and &s;ang, and gave Prai&s;e". They now "rejoyced before the Lord", and paid their grate|ful Honours to the God of their Salvation. "Then (&s;ay they) was our Mouth filled with <HI>Laughter,</HI> and our Tongue with <HI>Singing</HI>". It is a Dictate of Rea&s;on, as well as a Precept of Revelation, "Is any <HI>merry?</HI> let him <HI>&s;ing P&s;alms</HI>". This is univer&s;ally the Temper and Tendency of devout Souls. They are di&s;po&s;ed to "&s;anctify the Name of God" on all Occa&s;ions of Mirth. Not re&s;ting in <HI>Laughter,</HI> in natural and civil Merriment, the Children
<PB N="5" REF="008599_0007_102F955F3AE312C0">
of Zion have their devotional <HI>Singing.</HI> Not contented with entertaining one another, by &s;inging Ballads or re|hear&s;ing Poems among them&s;elves, on the joyful Themes in View, they addre&s;s Heaven with &s;acred "P&s;alms, Hymns, and &s;piritual Songs, &s;inging and making Melody in their Hearts to the LORD", in Proportion as they are "filled with the Spirit." So <HI>Mary</HI> &s;aid, "My Soul doth <HI>magnify</HI> the Lord, and my Spirit hath <HI>rejoyced</HI> in God my Saviour."&mdash;And &s;urely, it mu&s;t be granted, this is <HI>our</HI> rea&s;onable Ser|vice. "For it is good, to &s;ing Prai&s;es unto our God: for it is plea&s;ant, and Prai&s;e is comely".</P>
<P>Verily "<HI>every Day</HI> we &s;hould ble&s;s the Lord," and "rejoice in <HI>every good Thing</HI> which the Lord our God be|&s;toweth on us". But when he doeth great Things for us, as the&s;e furni&s;h us with Matter of exceeding Joy, &s;o they &s;hould proportionably warm our Hearts, and fill our Mouths with Prai&s;e; introducing the livelie&s;t Accents and mo&s;t chearful Notes into our Songs of Joy, while extolling Him who is great and greatly to be prai&s;ed. When God exalteth the Horn of his People, when he beautify's them with Salvation, crowns them with Loving-kindne&s;s, and marvellou&s;ly operates in his Providence for their Safety and Welfair, he then expects they be abundantly joyful in Glory, and &s;ing aloud the high Prai&s;es of their Divine Be|nefactor. On &s;uch Occa&s;ions, very eminently, the Call from Heaven is in tho&s;e emphatical Strains&mdash;"Prai&s;e ye the Lord. Sing unto the Lord a new Song, and his Prai&s;e in the Congregation of Saints. Let I&s;rael rejoyce in Him that made him: let the Children of Zion be joyful in their King.&mdash;"Prai&s;e him for his mighty Acts: prai&s;e him according to his excellent Greatne&s;s.&mdash;Declare his Do|ings among the People; make mention that his Name is exalted. Sing unto the Lord; for he hath done excellent Things: be it known in all the Earth. Shout, thou Inhabitant of Zion; for great is the Holy One of I&s;rael in the mid&s;t of thee.&mdash;O clap Hands, all ye People; &s;hout unto God with the Voice of Triumph. Sing Prai&s;es to God, &s;ing Prai&s;es. For God is King of all the Earth: &s;ing ye Prai&s;es with Under&s;tanding. The Shields of the
<PB N="6" REF="008599_0008_102F9560D8BD1588">
Earth belong unto God: He is greatly exalted.&mdash;"Sing ye to the Lord; for he hath triumphed gloriou&s;ly.&mdash;A&s;|cribe ye Greatne&s;s unto God.&mdash;"O &s;ing unto the Lord a new Song: for he hath done marvellous Things; his right Hand, and his holy Arm hath gotten him the Victory.&mdash;"Sing unto the Lord with the Voice of a P&s;alm: make a joyful Noi&s;e before the Lord, the King.&mdash;"Let Mount Zion rejoyce; let the Daughters of Judah be glad, becau&s;e of his Judgments.&mdash;"O give Thanks to Him who alone doeth great Wonders. O give Thanks unto the God of Heaven.&mdash;"Sing unto the Lord with Thank&s;giving. Prai&s;e the Lord, O Jeru&s;alem: prai&s;e thy God, O Zion."&mdash;In this pathetic Language, and with much Re-iteration, the Scriptures urge the Duty of Prai&s;e, joyful Prai&s;e, and fervent Thank&s;giving, to Him who&s;e Name alone is ex|cellent, and who doeth excellent Things, great and mar|vellous Things, without Number.</P>
<P>In Conformity to the&s;e Divine Injunctions, that is the Saint's Di&s;po&s;ition and Re&s;olution, and his Heart's De&s;ire, in the Language of the holy P&s;almi&s;t&mdash;"Thou, Lord, ha&s;t made me glad through thy Work: I will triumph in the Works of thy Hands. O Lord, how great are thy Works!&mdash;"I will extol thee, my God, O King; and I will ble&s;s thy Name for ever and ever. I will &s;peak of the glorious Honour of thy Maje&s;ty, and of thy wondrous Works. My Mouth &s;hall &s;peak the Prai&s;e of the Lord: and let all Fle&s;h ble&s;s his holy Name for ever and ever."&mdash;</P>
<P>Not &s;atisfy'd with his own per&s;onal Thank&s;givings and Prai&s;es, or with tho&s;e of the happy <HI>Few,</HI> like-minded with him&s;elf, the good Man (with the Spirit of the Royal P&s;al|mi&s;t) wi&s;hes, that "all the Earth" may &s;ing unto the Lord; that "all the Kindreds of the People" may give unto the Lord the Glory due to his Name; that "the People" may prai&s;e him, that "all the People" may prai&s;e him; that "every one that hath Breath" may prai&s;e the Name of the Lord.&mdash;</P>
<P>Not only does he &s;tir up his own Soul, and all that is within him, to ble&s;s the Lord; but con&s;cious of his Ine|quality to the heavenly Bu&s;ine&s;s, he calls in Help, and
<PB N="7" REF="008599_0009_102F956279797488">
would fain a&s;&s;ociate others with him&s;elf herein. He would have all unite their Prai&s;es with his, to honour God more &s;uitably to his Greatne&s;s, and to the Worthine&s;s of the Oc|ca&s;ion, on receiving of great and common Salvations, great and general Benefits. The Man who is animated with the P&s;almi&s;t's excellent Spirit, is ready to re&s;ound and echo to tho&s;e his pious and affectionate Exhortations&mdash;"O mag|nify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his Name toge|ther.&mdash;"O come, let us &s;ing unto the Lord: let us make a joyful Noi&s;e to the Rock of our Salvation. Let us come before his Pre&s;ence with Thank&s;giving and make a joyful Noi&s;e unto Him with P&s;alms. For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods.&mdash;"Ble&s;s the Lord, O hou&s;e of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> ble&s;s the Lord, O hou&s;e of <HI>Aaron;</HI> ble&s;s the Lord, O hou&s;e of <HI>Levi;</HI> ye that fear the Lord, ble&s;s the Lord&mdash;"Kings of the Earth; and all people; Princes, and all Judges of the Earth; both young Men and Maidens, old Men, and Children; let them prai&s;e the Name of the Lord."&mdash;This now I think, mu&s;t be the Voice of every pious Ob&s;erver of the Times, and Lover of Zion, concurrent with the Voice of God in his Word and Pro|vidence, re&s;pecting our Nation and Land at this Day. For, with the &s;tricte&s;t Propriety and upon the ju&s;te&s;t Grounds, we may adopt the Language of our <HI>Text</HI> (and may we all, by a &s;pecial Influence from the Spirit of Chri&s;t, unite in an Acknowledgement &s;o appo&s;ite to our Ca&s;e, with the like Fervor of Devotion, Gratitude and holy Triumph, as did the Church that fir&s;t made this exulting Speech!) <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>hath done great Things for us:</HI> whereof <HI>we are glad.</HI></P>

<P>Certainly GREAT BRITAIN is that happy I&s;land, where many the mo&s;t notable Tran&s;actions of a favourable Pro|vidence have been &s;een, both in former and later Ages.

Which was the Kingdom's Deliverance from the Tyranny of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome,</HI> and his dete&s;table Enormities; the Church's Purification from Abundance of vile Errors, Idolatries and Super&s;titions; the re&s;toring of the Holy Bible to common U&s;e; the &s;preading of Chri&s;tian Knowledge, and the ob|taining of a more &s;criptural Wor&s;hip than <HI>Britain</HI> for Ages before had ever &s;een; and in Con&s;equence of a Divine Ble&s;&s;ing on Divine In&s;titutions, the Recovery of Multi|tudes of Souls from Darkne&s;s to Light, from Bondage to Liberty, and from Death to Life, in a moral and &s;piritual Sen&s;e. A Work this, which mu&s;t needs appear truly &s;ur|prizing, if we review it in its Ri&s;e and Beginning; if we trace it in its Progre&s;s; if we attend to its Con&s;equences and Effects; if we reflect, how it has been guarded and watched over by a &s;pecial Providence, and carry'd &s;afe thro' many a dangerous Cri&s;is; how it has been &s;upported again&s;t the mo&s;t powerful Efforts of the combined Forces of Earth and Hell in Oppo&s;ition to it; how it has been re|vived, when &s;ometimes fallen into Decay and Langui&s;h|ment; and even when threatned with utter Ruin, has been renewed and re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, if not further advanced, by &s;ome happy and &s;ea&s;onable, but unexpected Turn of Affairs, in which have appeared very plain Signatures of a Divine Interpo&s;ition. And th&ocirc; the Reformation, &s;o &s;uc|ce&s;sfully begun, and &s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, has never been pro&s;ecuted to &s;uch a Degree of Perfection, as to leave no Room for future Improvements and Refinements, accord|ing to Scripture-Rule; yet was it, even from its fir&s;t Com|mencement

and in its lowe&s;t State, &s;uch a Wonder of Mercy to <HI>Britain,</HI> as de&s;erves to be had in everla&s;ting Remem|brance, and ju&s;tly claims a very thankful Mention when|ever we are thus in the &s;olemn A&s;&s;embly commemorating the great and manifold Mercies of God towards us.</P>
<P>The &s;hort Reign of that illu&s;trious young Prince (our engli&s;h <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI>) King EDWARD the &s;ixth, who &s;tood at the Head of the Reformation in <HI>England,</HI> truly meriting his hereditary Title "the Defender of the Faith", and ap|proving him&s;elf the Patron of pure Religion, as well as a con&s;picuous Example of Royal Virtue and early Piety; his &s;hort Reign, I &s;ay, if we had Lea&s;ure to take a parti|cular View of it, would pre&s;ent us with &s;ome of the mo&s;t admirable Scenes of Providence, and entertain us with a plea&s;ing Variety of great Things done for the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> I&s;rael, e&s;pecially in the Conduct and Succe&s;s of that glorious En|terprize, the Reformation, then &s;o happily in Pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>And when, upon the Demi&s;e of that incomparable Royal Reformer, a <HI>Popi&s;h Queen,</HI> the infamous MARY, &s;ucceeded to the Crown, who &s;et her &s;elf to ruin the Pro|te&s;tant Intere&s;t, and &s;oon prevailed to reduce Things into the old Channel of Corruption; reviving the Here&s;ies and Idolatries, that had been exploded and purged away; pro|&s;tituting Maje&s;ty by an abject Submi&s;&s;ion to a foreign Yoke, and reconciling her Court and Realm to his offended Holi|ne&s;s of <HI>Rome;</HI> but kindling the Flames of Per&s;ecution again&s;t the Puritan Reformers, and pur&s;uing with Ven|geance all &s;uch as were brave and hone&s;t enough not to &s;trike in with her impious and tyrannous Mea&s;ures; which drove great Numbers of her be&s;t Subjects into Exile, impove|ri&s;h'd Multitudes, ruin'd many a fair E&s;tate, and &s;acri|ficed many a precious Life;&mdash;O what a merciful Inter|po&s;ition of Providence was it, by the <HI>Queen'</HI>s Decea&s;e, to put a quick Period to her bloody Reign, and &s;o to the mo&s;t &s;hocking Scenes of Horror!</P>

<P>In the Reign of King CHARLES the Fir&s;t, when, under the too prevalent Influence of a <HI>Popi&s;h Queen,</HI> and the Coun&s;els of a <HI>Popi&s;hly affected</HI> Party about the Court, &s;uch large Strides were taken towards arbitrary Power, and when the Nation was groaning under &s;uch Stretches and Abu&s;es of the Prerogative, and &s;uch Incur&s;ions upon Li|berty and Property, to which violent and illegal Mea&s;ures all the Calamities of that impolitic and impro&s;perous Reign &s;eem to have been radically &amp; primarily owing; what a &s;ig|nal Interpo&s;ition of Divine Providence on behalf of a Peo|ple &s;o injured and threatned with Ruin, was to be &s;een in that &s;ea&s;onable and noble Stand, a &s;pirited and free, but loyal <HI>Parliament</HI> made, in Support of civil Right, and for the Redre&s;s of national Grievances! And was there not vi&s;ibly the Hand of God in &s;uch a general Coale&s;cence and firm U|nion of all Ranks of People, Gentry and Commonalty, on the Side of the Oppo&s;ition! And indeed it &s;eems to have been the natural Right of the People, if not their indi&s;pen|&s;able Duty, to adhere to the <HI>Parliament,</HI> at lea&s;t &s;o long as they acted in Character, as authorized Guardians of the Community, as the public Con&s;ervators of their legal Rights and civil Liberties, and went into none but true Patriotic Mea&s;ures.

<P>The <HI>Interregnum</HI> that follow'd, however &s;ome Circum|&s;tances attending it, or &s;ome of its Tran&s;actions, might ca&s;t a Gloom over it, yet I think, was not without a Mixture of &s;uch Events in Providence, in that Day, as con&s;pired to advance the Glory and Felicity of <HI>Britain,</HI> and &s;uch as may ju&s;tly &s;trike the calm unprejudiced Reflector with Ad|miration.

That notwith&s;tanding &s;uch Emulations and Cla&s;hings among a Variety of Parties, and &s;uch Changes in the Admini&s;tra|tion of civil Government, there &s;hould be &s;o much good Or|der maintained, and the Cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice &s;o well pre&s;erved!

<P>When the Re&s;toration of Monarchy in the Per&s;on of King CHARLES the Second came on, it is ob&s;ervable, though together with this there was a Re&s;toration of arbitrary Mea&s;ures of Government, though a Deluge of Corrupti|ons and Di&s;orders broke in with it, and though the Per&s;e|cution of Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters was renewed and carried on with a high Hand, yet by a Divine over-ruling Providence Good was brought out of Evil, and <HI>Britain'</HI>s Happine&s;s the more advanced, and better &s;ecured, in the Event.

<P>Mo&s;t of the&s;e Remarks are equally applicable to the Ca&s;e as it &s;tood in the next Reign, that of King JAMES the Second.

gratifying one Party, and at other times courting the other, and all with an Aim to weaken the common Cau&s;e, the&s;e Managements only &s;erved to draw their Attention to the common Danger, to drive the contending Parties nearer together, to make them willing to come to a Tem|per among them&s;elves, and unite their Efforts for the com|mon Safety. And &s;uch at length was the Union of the whole Nation in Oppo&s;ition to the KING's Religion and Politicks, that an Invitation was &s;ent to that celebrated General and Politician, the PRINCE of <HI>Orange</HI> (the King's Son in Law) to come over to their Help, for the Redre&s;s of Grievances, the Re&s;cue of civil Liberty, and Security of the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t. A Conduct highly becoming a free People, ju&s;tifiable by the great Law of Self-Pre&s;erva|tion, and in my Views of it, &s;o near a-kin to the Parlia|mentary Oppo&s;ition to King CHARLES the Fir&s;t, that I know not how any can con&s;i&s;tently approve the one and condemn the other. This Precedent may &s;uffice forever to &s;ilence all Pleas for indefea&s;ible hereditary Right, Non|re&s;i&s;tance and pa&s;&s;ive Obedience; which have &s;ometimes made &s;uch a Noi&s;e, but now &s;eem happily laid a&s;leep. This Conduct, at lea&s;t, has declared the general Sen&s;e of the Nation, and left a notable Te&s;timony to the Cau&s;e of civil Liberty, and the Prote&s;tant Religion. In this a won|derful Hand of God is to be &s;een and acknowledged.&mdash;This prepared the Way for the Nation's Deliverance. And a ble&s;&s;ed Deliverance it was, when King JAMES, either through Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of Guilt, or through Cowardize, un|der the Apprehen&s;ion of approaching Danger, made his <HI>Exit</HI> (as inglorious a one perhaps as that of his Royal Fa|ther, though not in the &s;ame Manner) fir&s;t abdicating his Crown, and then for&s;aking his Kingdom, and going into a kind of voluntary Exile. By which Means a civil War was happily prevented; and hereby, pur&s;uant to na|tural Right, the Nation was at Liberty to fill the vacant Throne by Election of a Succe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>And upon whom &s;hould the Eyes of the Nation more naturally be turn'd, than their glorious Deliverer, who &s;tood &s;o nearly related to the Throne, e&s;pecially by his

As a Medium to this ble&s;&s;ed Purpo&s;e, God put it into the King's Heart, to get the Crown legally entail'd, in &s;uch a Manner, that <HI>Britain</HI> might hope for a glorious Race of <HI>Pro|te&s;tant Princes,</HI> to &s;way the Sceptre in Righteou&s;ne&s;s and in Mercy.&mdash;And the Royal Favour, not re&s;train'd by Bigotry to any one Sett of the King's Prote&s;tant Subjects, but conducted by an impartial View to the public Good, procured an Act of Parliament to e&s;tabli&s;h a Toleration and Allowance of <HI>Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters;</HI> to their great Relief and Quiet, as well as to the greater Advantage and firmer Security of the common Cau&s;e, wherein all, who&s;e Hearts are truly Prote&s;tant, are con&s;tantly united.&mdash;However, while he e&s;teem'd it his Glory to rule over a free People, and con&s;ulted the general Good in allowing a rea&s;onable Liberty to all his loyal Subjects; yet, as be|came a true Father, he at the &s;ame time took Care to fence them about with whole&s;ome Laws, for the Security of good Manners, and would indulge none in a wicked Li|centiou&s;ne&s;s. His Heart appear'd warmly engaged in the

noble De&s;ign of exalting the National Character, and im|proving the Genius of his People, by rectifying and rai&s;ing their Morals. And it is not the lea&s;t among the Glories of his au&s;picious Reign, that tho&s;e excellent "Societies for Re|formation of Manners" had their Ri&s;e in it, and flouri&s;hed under his powerful Patronage.&mdash;Nor was his Royal Care limited to the Shores of <HI>Britain,</HI> but extended it &s;elf to the remote&s;t <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Factories and Plantations beyond Sea. As a Father mindful of his Children ab&s;ent, the King &s;ought the Weal of his Prote&s;tant Subjects abroad, as well as at home, and was equally concerned to &s;ecure their Religion and Liberty. Where any of them were in Hazard of being &s;educed to <HI>Popery,</HI> and &s;o of being drawn into Slavery, he was in Care to have them provided with a good Pre&s;erva|tive; and where any Factory or Settlement had not Strength enough within it &s;elf to procure and maintain the Mini&s;try of the Word, he took Care to make Provi&s;ion for their A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and even for the Support of Prote&s;tant Mi&s;&s;i|ons, to pro&s;elyte the <HI>Heathen</HI> to Chri&s;tianity. On &s;uch heroic De&s;igns, and not on any little narrow Party. Views, was founded that Royal In&s;titution of the "Society for propagating the Go&s;pel in foreign Parts".&mdash;[Nor can I believe, it ever entred into the KING's generous Heart, that the Charities given on this noble Foundation, &s;hould be principally applied to &s;erve the Intention of reclaiming <HI>Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters</HI> to the Epi&s;copal Communion, whe|ther at home or abroad.

Providence, the&s;e Colonies were delivered from im|pending Ruin, by Means of the glorious Revolution, and the happy Acce&s;&s;ion of King WILLIAM to the Throne: who of his Royal Grace renewed or continued their Char|ters, and with a Paternal Plea&s;ure &s;aw them ca&s;ed of their Grievances, and re&s;tored to a &s;ecure and pro&s;perous State. Now were their Complaints turned into Songs, and they were <HI>like unto them that dream.</HI> They now found Re|po&s;e and Solace, in the undi&s;turbed Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Liberty and Property, of their Laws, their civil Rights, and their religious Privileges; partaking largely in the National Happine&s;s, under the wi&s;e, the equal, the Prote&s;tant Go|vernment of King WILLIAM, who&s;e Memory is ble&s;&s;ed: And it may fitly be &s;ubjoined here, on who&s;e Royal Head (even after the Lo&s;s of his excellent Partner in the Throne) &s;till the Crown &s;at &s;afe and flouri&s;hing, to the Joy of his loyal Subjects, both at home and abroad.

For it is very remarkable, how a gracious Providence watch'd over the Deliverer of the Nation, and the Shield of its Liberty, civil and &s;acred; to defend his Per&s;on, to &s;upport his Throne, and to crown his Reign with Pro&s;pe|rity and Fame, to the great Glory and Happine&s;s of <HI>Bri|tain</HI> and its Dependences.&mdash;The&s;e &s;urely are Wonders of interpo&s;ing Mercy, never to be forgotten; &s;uch as mu&s;t al|ways make a di&s;tingui&s;hing Figure in the Engli&s;h Story; and well de&s;erve a grateful Mention on this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Nor was Queen ANNE's Reign, who next &s;ucceeded to the Crown, without tho&s;e In&s;tances of a benevolent over|ruling Providence in Favour of <HI>Britain</HI> and its Colonies, that merit our grateful Reflexions.

It mu&s;t be acknowledg'd, this female Reign was for a Cour&s;e of Years very much &s;ignaliz'd and honoured in Providence. It was highly dignify'd in particular, by a ju&s;t, a mild, a wi&s;e Admini&s;tration of civil Government; by a Parliamentary Confirmation of the Revolution-Entail of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Crown; by a Ratification of the legal Allow|ance or Toleration of Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters; by the Union of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> in one common Kingdom, to the &s;trengthning their common Intere&s;ts, in re&s;pect of civil Li|berty and the Prote&s;tant Religion; by the Reduction of <HI>Port-Royal</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> which open'd the way for the Con|que&s;t and Recovery of all <HI>Nova-Scotia;</HI>&mdash;in fine, by an almo&s;t incredible Series of prodigious Victories, and tri|umphant Succe&s;&s;es in War, under the Conduct of that con&s;ummate martial Genius, the <HI>Duke</HI> of MARLBO|ROUGH a General mo&s;t de&s;ervedly of the fir&s;t Character in his Day.&mdash;But alas, in Proce&s;s of Time much of the Glory departed. Several of the la&s;t Years of this Reign make no very honorable or con&s;i&s;tent Figure in its Annals. The <HI>Queen,</HI> thr&ocirc; &s;ome unhappy Weakne&s;s, was tempted to di&s;card her old and be&s;t Servants; and a Change of her Mini&s;try brought on a Change of her Mea&s;ures.

<P>In vain had there been repeated Attempts before, to effect what is now &s;o happily accompli&s;hed.

Yet now at length, through the good Hand of our God upon us, we &s;ee the happy Day of its Accompli&s;hment.

<P>I congratulate my Country upon &s;o illu&s;trious an Event, &s;o felicitous a Conclu&s;ion of the&s;e martial Enterprizes, and upon the joyful Pro&s;pects now before us.</P>
<P>We join our <HI>Thanks</HI> with tho&s;e of the <HI>General,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the "<HI>Journal</HI> of the Proceedings of the Army under <HI>Gen.</HI> AMHERST", we find this Article among the <HI>Orders,</HI> dated "Camp before MONTREAL, <HI>Sept.</HI> 9" being the Day after the Surrender&mdash;<Q>The GENERAL fees with infinite <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> the Succe&s;s, that has crowned the indefatigable Efforts of his Maje&s;ty's Troops, and faithful Subjects in <HI>America.</HI>&mdash;The three Armies are intituled to the General's <HI>Thanks</HI> on this Occa&s;ion; and he a&s;&s;ures them, that he will take the fir&s;t Opportunity of acquainting his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> with the Zeal and Bravery, which has always been exerted by the Officers and Soldiers, of the <HI>Regular</HI> and <HI>Provincial</HI> Troops, and al&s;o by his faithful <HI>Indian</HI> Allies.</Q></NOTE>&mdash;to the brave TROOPS, that have fought our Battles for us, and been otherwi&s;e In&s;trumental in <HI>doing for us tho&s;e great Things, whereof we are glad.</HI></P>
<P>We owe our <HI>Thanks</HI> to the GENERAL him&s;elf, who has by his re&s;pectable Pre&s;ence and Example been the very Soul of this deci&s;ive Enterprize, and in his Conduct and Succe&s;s united &s;hines unrivald.</P>

who otherwi&s;e mu&s;t have &s;unk under an immen&s;e Load of Debt.</P>
<P>Above all, we owe our humble <HI>Thanks</HI> to his MAJESTY: and with loyal Hearts, full of joyous Gratitude, we <HI>ble&s;s the King</HI> for his Paternal Goodne&s;s in &s;ending &s;uch effectual Aids to his <HI>American</HI> Subjects, in our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed State, when we &s;o needed the Royal Protection; as the Enemy were daily increa&s;ing in their Advantages again&s;t us, and threatning our Ruin; which is now happily prevented, by the extraordi|nary Turn of Affairs, upon his MAJESTY's gracious In|terpo&s;ition.</P>
<P>But &s;till our <HI>Thanks</HI> are not to centre &amp; determine here. No; they mu&s;t ri&s;e above all human Agents, and a&s;cend to the &s;upreme Efficient, the God of Armies, the King of Kings, and the primary Source of every pro&s;perous Event. "The Race is not to the Swift, nor the Battle to the Strong"; but "Victory is of the LORD". It is "through God", that our Forces "have done valiantly". It is God, who hath "trodden down our Enemies". It is God, who hath "given us Re&s;t", incircling us on all Sides. To the Maje&s;ty of Heaven we are &s;upremely indebted, for the glorious Salvations and Succe&s;&s;es we are this Day rejoycing in.

<P>Now then that "our Heads are lifted up above our Ene|mies round about", we &s;hould rai&s;e our wondring Eyes &amp; our thankful Hearts up to God in the Heavens; "offering in his Tabernacle the Sacrifices of Joy"; with joyful Lips &s;inging Prai&s;es to the LORD, who hath done for us all the&s;e <HI>great Things,</HI> whereof we are <HI>glad;</HI> but the Accompli&s;h|ment whereof we once look'd upon as hopele&s;s; and for the <HI>one half</HI> or even any &s;mall Part whereof, we &s;hould have been very thankful, at lea&s;t very <HI>glad,</HI> &s;ome few Years ago. A Reflexion this, which may well exalt our Joy, warm our Gratitude, and rai&s;e every pious &amp; plea&s;ing Affection to an uncommon Height, while on an uncommon Occa&s;ion we are pre&s;enting our Thanks to the LORD, who hath done &s;uch great Things for us.</P>

Worthy our Attention and Imitation is that Example of King <HI>Jeho&s;haphat</HI> and his People's uniting their joyful. Thank&s;givings to God, on an Occa&s;ion &s;omething &s;imilar. The Scripture-Story (2 <HI>Chro.</HI> 20.) informs us, how "on the fourth Day" after a &s;ignal Conque&s;t, the King and his Peo|ple on the Field of Action, <Q>a&s;&s;embled them&s;elves, &amp; <HI>ble&s;&s;ed the</HI> LORD. Then they returned every Man, and <HI>Jeho&s;ha|phat</HI> in the Fore-front of them, to go again to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> with <HI>Joy:</HI> for the LORD <HI>had made them to rejoyce over their Enemies.</HI>&mdash;And the Fear of GOD was on all the King|doms of tho&s;e Countries, when they had heard that the LORD had <HI>fought again&s;t the Enemies of I&s;rael.</HI> So the Realm of <HI>Jeho&s;haphat</HI> was <HI>quiet:</HI> for his <HI>God gave him Re&s;t round about.</HI></Q> The <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> they had, and their <HI>Joy</HI> upon it, are a&s;cribed to God, as equally the Author of both. Doubtle&s;s, as to the Royal General, and ma|ny of his People, it was that <HI>Joy</HI> which <HI>is the Fruit of the Spirit,</HI>&mdash;a religious Exultation, a "Rejoycing <HI>be|fore the Lord</HI>", and "triumphing in <HI>his Prai&s;e</HI>". They triumphed and rejoyced <HI>over their Enemies;</HI> but &s;till in a Frame and Manner becoming &s;uch as &s;aw and owned the Hand of <HI>God</HI> in their Succe&s;s, and meant to "give Glory to his Name". This Scripture-Pattern &s;erves to ju&s;tify the pre&s;ent <HI>Fe&s;tival;</HI> and recommends to our Practice the &s;olemn, but chearful Duties, we are now called together joyntly to perform.</P>
<P>Let us then give our&s;elves, on this delightful Occa&s;ion, to holy Rejoycing, Thanksgiving and Prai&s;e. Let us "<HI>con|&s;ider</HI> how great Things God hath done for us", particularly re&s;pecting the important <HI>Conque&s;t,</HI> whereof we are <HI>glad.</HI> Let us reali&s;e what abundant Rea&s;on we have to admire the Conduct of Divine Providence, relative to this Affair, view'd in its whole State, from its Beginning, through all its Progre&s;s, to its happy Termination. We &s;hould take Notice of GOD's Goodne&s;s in putting into the <HI>King's</HI> Heart &s;uch an earne&s;t Care for our Security and Welfair: and in guiding the Coun|&s;els of the King's <HI>Mini&s;try,</HI> to project the be&s;t Mea&s;ures, and to employ the be&s;t Agents in executing the wife Plan of Operations. In &s;hort, every In&s;tance of good Conduct, and of Re&s;olution, and Fortitude, every In&s;tance of Support
<PB N="34" REF="008599_0036_102F95BBD010CB00">
and Succe&s;s in this grand Affair, from its Commencement to its Conclu&s;ion, &s;hould be taken Notice of, as the Effect of a propitious <HI>Providence</HI> &s;uper-intending &amp; pre&s;iding in it. Every advantageous Circum&s;tance, every &s;ub&s;ervient and auxiliary Incident, as well as the grand and final Event, is to ob&s;erved, as the Fruit of Divine Benignity. All tends to heighten the Glory and the Mercy of the Succe&s;s: and all con&s;pires to demand our grateful Acknowledgments to "the Lord of Ho&s;ts" the &s;upreme Author of Victory.</P>
<P>We are called, on this Occa&s;ion to &s;ing both of <HI>Mercy,</HI> and of <HI>Judgment;</HI> to &s;ing of both "to the Lord our God" to celebrate the Wonders of <HI>Mercy</HI> to us, and of <HI>Judgment</HI> on our Enemies.&mdash;Yea, his <HI>Judgments</HI> on our&s;elves, in the general Calamity of War, and in particular Di&s;a&s;ters, are not to be forgotten, even in our Songs of Prai&s;e. As mourn|ful and joyful Events are mingled in Providence, we &s;hould have our Reflexions on both, in the Exerci&s;e of various Pa&s;&s;ions, corre&s;ponding to each. Antecedent <HI>humbling</HI> E|vents might be de&s;ign'd in Providence to prepare a ju&s;t <HI>Allay</HI> to future Joys: And the <HI>Evil</HI> intermixed with the <HI>Good</HI> we receive at the Hand of the LORD, may well &s;erve to cor|rect and qualify the <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> his Benefits give us. It will be wife in us to to temper the Joy that now expands our Brea&s;ts, by proper Reflexions on the inau&s;picious and dark Appearances preceding our late Succe&s;&s;es, &amp; on the di&s;a&s;trous Events attending them. One Circum&s;tance, in particular, &s;hould not a little affect us, that human Life has &s;o often been &s;acrificed (by the Sword, or Di&s;ea&s;e, or Accident) in the Pur|&s;uit of <HI>Victory;</HI> and as Victory is apprehended to have been <HI>lo&s;t,</HI> in one memorable In&s;tance, by "the Fall of the Mighty,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The brave Lord Howe. in that fruitle&s;s Attempt at <HI>Ticonderoga.</HI></NOTE> &s;o it hath in &s;everal In&s;tances been <HI>purcha&s;ed</HI> at the Expence of &s;ome of the mo&s;t precious Blood, in the Fall of heroic <HI>Generals</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. WOLFE, and Gen. PRIDEAUX, who both expired amid&s;t Glory, in the near View of Conque&s;t.</NOTE> and other gallant Officers and Men. The&s;e are &s;triking Events, at the Remembrance of which we can &s;carce refrain mingling Tears with our pre&s;ent Joys. But the Sorrow for <HI>former</HI> Lo&s;&s;es, of this Kind, we mu&s;t balance with the Joy of our la&s;t Succe&s;&s;es being obtained without any
<PB N="35" REF="008599_0037_102F95BD64661998">
&s;uch aggravated Lo&s;&s;es, and with an uncommonly &s;mall Effu&s;ion of Blood.&mdash;However, I think, no Reflexions whatever &s;hould &s;uppre&s;s our <HI>Joy</HI> on this grand Occa&s;ion, though they may be needful to re&s;train &amp; moderate it.</P>
<P>A Tran&s;port of Mind, on the News of a Conque&s;t and Acqui&s;ition, &s;o big with Salvation and Ble&s;&s;ing to one's Country as this we are now rejoycing in, is &s;carce avoida|ble, and is certainly allowable. And the more nearly we are intere&s;ted in the Succe&s;s, naturally the more elevated will the Plea&s;ure be. In this Re&s;pect, though the Pro&s;pe|rity of the <HI>Pru&s;&s;ian, Hanoverian,</HI> and <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Arms in <HI>Ger|many</HI> at this Day is ju&s;t Matter of Joy and Prai&s;e; yet it is rea&s;onably to be expected, that Victory nearer <HI>Home,</HI> and more immediately affecting our &s;elves, &s;hould &s;trike our Minds with a &s;ingular Force, and that &s;o great &amp; important a Conque&s;t as that which occa&s;ions this Day's Solemnity, &s;hould open all the Springs of plea&s;ing Pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;well the Tide of Joy beyond its common Bounds.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, let it not be meerly a <HI>rejoycing over our E|nemies,</HI> nor only rejoycing in our own Pro&s;perity. But let the Joy be &s;ublimated, &s;piritualized, and carried up to its proper ultimate Object, "the Captain of our Salvation," the Giver of Victory.&mdash;By all Means let us &s;ee to it, that our rejoycing on the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion be duly regulated&mdash;Not the meer Mirth of <HI>Brutes,</HI> centring in animal Plea&s;ures&mdash;Not the Mirth of <HI>Fools,</HI> conducted as if we had no Fear of God before our Eyes, and expre&s;&s;ed only in Laughter &amp; Levity, in lawle&s;s Fea&s;ting and Frolicking&mdash;Nor yet only the more &s;ober and temperate (but almo&s;t as carnal) Joy of <HI>Hypo|crites,</HI> who honour God with joyful Lips, while yet in their Hearts and Lives they di&s;honour Him; being in truth "evil and unthankful".&mdash;Nor let it be a proud and &s;elf-boa&s;ting Joy, as if "our own Arm had &s;aved us", or our own Worthine&s;s had procured us the Victory. "Neither glory ye in Men."&mdash;"All &s;uch Rejoycing is evil."&mdash;"But he that glorieth, let him glory in the LORD."</P>
<P>Let our Rejoycing be manly, rational, &s;piritual, devotio|nal, and "after a godly Sort", in all its Exerci&s;es &amp; Expre&s;|&s;ions.&mdash;Let the Joy of our Hearts tran&s;pire thro' our Lips in the mo&s;t grateful Acknowledgments &amp; Prai&s;es to God, in the
<PB N="36" REF="008599_0038_102F95C0E814AA78">
Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Thus will our <HI>Joy</HI> be con&s;ecrated, and turned into a <HI>Sacrifice;</HI> a "&s;piritual Sacrifice, accep|table to God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t". And the &s;acred Plea&s;ure will be gradually increa&s;ed by daily renewed Thank&s;giv|ings and Prai&s;es.&mdash;Only, at the &s;ame Time, "let our <HI>Con|ver&s;ation</HI> be as becometh the Go&s;pel", that by our obedient Lives, as well as joyful and thankful Lips, we may te&s;tify our Delight in God, and prove the Sincerity of our Gratitude to Him. Surely the Call of Heaven to us at this Day is in &s;uch Language as that (1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 12. 24.) "<HI>Only fear the Lord, and &s;erve him in Truth: for con&s;ider how great Things he hath done for you.</HI> Or, that (P&s;al. 2. 11.) <HI>Serve the Lord with Fear, and rejoyce with Trembling.</HI> As God has been doing great Things for us, &s;urely he expects great Things <HI>from</HI> us, in a way of practical Returns. And be it remembred, He that has done great Things <HI>for</HI> us, the &s;ame can al&s;o do great Things <HI>again&s;t</HI> us. We &s;ee, his almighty Hand can bring about great Changes in a little Time. And when we reflect on the Mutability of human Affairs, toge|ther with our Unworthine&s;s of Divine Favours, and our De&s;ert of Judgments, it becomes us to "rejoyce with Trem|bling." In un&s;potted Ju&s;tice, God might have made our Enemies to rejoyce over us: and he may do it &s;till. What can we expect, but the Tokens of his Di&s;plea&s;ure, in this or &s;ome other tremendous Way, unle&s;s his Goodne&s;s effectu|ally leadeth us to Repentance!</P>
<P>To our Prai&s;es therefore let us add our <HI>Prayers,</HI> that Pro&s;perity may be &s;anctify'd to us, and made a prevailing Argument with us, from a Sen&s;e of Ingenuity &amp; Gratitude, to &s;erve the LORD with Gladne&s;s. Let us pray that the Spirit may be poured from on high, to re&s;tore Religion to a pro&s;perous and victorious State. Let us implore a Divine Ble&s;&s;ing on the King's Coun&s;els and Efforts for a &s;afe and ad|vantageous Peace. But above all, let it be our Care and Prayer, that the Kingdom of the Son of God may be advan|ced; that the Conque&s;ts of his Power &amp; Grace over the Souls of Men may &s;pread through the World; that there may be Glory to God in the highe&s;t, Peace on Earth, and Good|will towards Men.</P>
