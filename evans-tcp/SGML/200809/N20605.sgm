<HEAD>The following TESTIMONY concerning <HI>Acceptable Wor&s;hip to Almighty God,</HI> was given in writing by <HI>DNNIS GETCHELL,</HI> late of Va&s;&s;alborough, in the ea&s;tern part of Newengland, a little before his death, who was educated in the Congregational or Pre&s;byterian relig|ion; was in the office of Captain and afterwards a Major, in the late war, and for &s;ome time a member of the general court at Bo&s;ton; he decea&s;ed aboat the month called April, <HI>1791.</HI></HEAD>
<P>"I AM moved and di&s;po&s;ed to leave this te&s;ti|mony for the truth, in humble gratitude, prai&s;e and thank&s;giving unto the great author and pre&s;erver of my being, who in his marvellous lov|ing kindne&s;s hath vi&s;ited my &s;oul with a &s;en&s;ible knowledge of what I now communicate; and that I have not been moved thereunto by the advice, con&s;ultation or direction of any mortal; but pure|ly for the honour of the holy head of the church of God, and the good of my fellow mortals, to bear te&s;timony, that no man can acceptably wor&s;hip the adorable God, but in, through and by the influ|ence of his own Eternal Spirit of Truth and Right|cou&s;ne&s;s, in the pure &s;ilence of all fle&s;h; not as

<P>"And I feel my &s;oul impre&s;&s;ed through a &s;en&s;e of duty to God, and as a warning to others, who are or may have been made &s;en&s;ible of the truth as held by this people, to freely own, that being blinded by the god of this world, in love with the honour and friend&s;hip thereof, and through a fear of the &s;hame of the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, I have been di&s;obedient to the heavenly vi&s;itation of God's love, and thereby deprived my&s;elf of many pre|cious opportunities, that I believe I &s;hould have been favoured with, had I been faithful to the ju&s;t witne&s;s which (during the time of my confine|ment) I have often had deeply to mourn for before God: I feel therefore de&s;irous that none may &s;light the day of their vi&s;itation, or &s;han the cro&s;s through fear of man, or the reproach of the world, but
<PB N="5" REF="027050_0004_0FD37966550C8CC0">that they may be prevailed upon to give cheerful obedience to the dictates of truth in the mind, where is placed God's witne&s;s, a mini&s;ter of the &s;anctuary whom all ought to hear and obey.</P>
<P>"In te&s;timony of my love to the pure wor&s;hip of God, I do reque&s;t and advi&s;e, that my family meet with and attend the religious meetings of Friends.</P>
<P>"Given forth this &s;ixth day of the fourth month 1791, at Va&s;&s;alborough, as a te&s;timony for the truth, in the fear of God, under the enlivening in|fluence of good hope and de&s;ire that the Lord may make it u&s;eful for the promotion of truth; and that he who is a ju&s;t rewarder of all &s;uch as love, and diligently &s;eek him, will graciou&s;ly conde&s;cend to receive this free will offering at my hands, un|to whom be all Glory, Honour, Maje&s;ty and Pow|er, with everla&s;ting thank&s;giving a&s;cribed for ever|more.

<HEAD>Some Account of Dennis Getchell afore&s;aid, as certified by a per&s;on who was well acquaint|ed with him in Years pa&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>HE was a man of good natural abilities, and reputation in the parts where he lived, hav|ing his re&s;idence at Va&s;&s;alborough afore&s;aid, ap|pearing &s;trong in argument, cogent in rea&s;oning, deep in his re&s;earches after the origination of mat|ter and things, of a &s;teady conduct; was deemed a good neighbour and an u&s;eful member of civil &s;ociety: After &s;erving in &s;everal public &s;tations (as fir&s;t mentioned) in the latter part of his life he had conferred on him a commi&s;&s;ion of the peace: He had been convinced of the truth, relating to a principle of inward light and grace being confer|red on every man, as a pure infallible teacher, con|&s;i&s;tent with the doctrine of the people called Qua|kers (although it is &s;lighted and &s;poken again&s;t by many profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tianity:) And being up|wards of twelve years ago remarkably reached and tendered in his &s;pirit under the te&s;timony of a
<PB N="8" REF="027050_0006_0FD37EAF063EA9D0">mini&s;ter of that religious &s;ociety, at a meeting held near his dwelling, his mind was for &s;ome time apparently turned from the &s;entiments received by education, with de&s;ires to take up the cro&s;s and walk in a narrower way, which he then &s;aw was nece&s;&s;a|ry in order to obtain inward peace; but his re&s;olu|tions did not prove to be &s;trong enough to withdraw from, and with&s;tand the &s;tream he had been accu&s;|tomed to, in regard to worldly friend&s;hip with the maxims and honours thereof, &s;o as to make a &s;olid progre&s;s in the true chri&s;tian path of &s;elf denial; therefore, although he retained a regard for the &s;ociety called Quakers, he never joined him&s;elf among them as a member: When his health de|clined, through the prevalence of a &s;ore di&s;order, he was vi&s;ited with a &s;en&s;e of divine mercy, and it is hoped he witne&s;&s;ed forgivene&s;s of &s;ins; often greatly bemoaning his folly and di&s;obedience in not being faithful to the inward principle of truth and its di&s;coveries of chri&s;tian duty, which he had been favoured to &s;ee in time path was a &s;ore way of obtaining &s;alvation. The humble penitent &s;tate of his mind near the clo&s;e of his life, appears from the tenor of his expre&s;&s;ions heareafter in&s;ert|ed: Out of the many of like nature which he ut|tered in the time of his illne&s;s; the&s;e following having been faithfully pre&s;erved in writing, were lately communicated for more general benefit to a per&s;on at Provindence in the State of Rhodei&s;land, by one of &s;aid Getchell's near neighbours, who was formerly a magi&s;trate of that place, and re|mains to be a per&s;on of good reputation and un|doubted veracity.</P>
<P>Upon his giving over any expectation of help from phy&s;icians at the place where he lived, he con|cluded
<PB N="9" REF="027050_0007_0FD37EB03453ACF8">to embark for Bo&s;ton, and being about to take leave of his near connections and others, in an opportunity at that time happening, he appeared to be much contrited; but being evidently under the refining hand of divine power, which purifies from nature's dro&s;s (although heretofore he mo&s;tly had words at will) he was now &s;o reduced and curbed in by an awful &s;en&s;e of his own unworthine&s;s, be|fore the Supreme Judge of the world, that he &s;aid; "notwith&s;tanding it looks very dark and uncer|tain, whether I &s;hall ever &s;ee my family any more; yet I am &s;o &s;hut up that I cannot communicate any advice or in&s;truction to them; I can only ut|ter words without life: The Almighty hath &s;hut my mouth, and whether ever it will plea&s;e him to open it again, I know not; and if I am not fa|voured to &s;peak in the life, I mu&s;t leave them without a word, however trying."</P>
<P>Taking leave, he &s;aid, "Friends, all I can &s;ay is farewell," which he uttered in a broken man|ner.</P>
<P>Not long after his return from Bo&s;ton (being al&s;o given over by the phy&s;icians there) he &s;eemed favoured with a &s;en&s;e of divine mercy, in the liv|ing hope of pardon and &s;alvation; and many of his relations and neighbours being pre&s;ent, he warned them to beware of the polutions and vani|ties of the world; and &s;trongly advi&s;ed them to re&s;train their families from going out into compa|ny, and not to indulge their children in frequent|ing places of ill example, as he &s;aid he had too much done in his time; he warned them in a particular manner again&s;t the <HI>pernicious principle of Dei&s;m;</HI> and al&s;o the <HI>Univer&s;alian principle,</HI> as imbibed by many now-a-days; touching a belief
<PB N="10" REF="027050_0008_0FD37EB2110C22C0">that none are to be perpetually puni&s;hed after death, whatever their actions may have been in life; "this (&s;aid he) has a tendency to induce people to think light of God's attributes, mercy and judgment; to which principle I had given too much attention, to the &s;cattering of my own mind from the pure principle of truth: Oh, be|ware of its &s;ugge&s;tions, whereby many I fear are captivated to the rain of their poor immortal &s;ouls," with much more to the &s;ame purpo&s;e: At another time he &s;aid in &s;ub&s;tance thus, "Words do not &s;eem to me as once they did; I often feel &s;hut up, and cannot &s;ay a word; &s;ome people come in, and think they mu&s;t do &s;omething; and &s;o without life <HI>(or with un&s;anctified lips)</HI> &s;peak of things they have only heard with their <HI>(outward)</HI> ears; but it is a burden to me: At other times I feel &s;uch openne&s;s, that I fear I &s;hall exceed my bounds, if you &s;ee this to be my ca&s;e, pray admoni&s;h me."&mdash; He often de&s;ired to collect his family, when friends came, &s;aying, "I have no opportunity of getting out to meetings," upon which occa&s;ions there ap|peared evident tokens of divine goodne&s;s being near.</P>
<P>At one time while &s;ome per&s;ons &s;at with him at &s;upper, he &s;aid in a very &s;en&s;ible and feeling man|ner, "I have often (when &s;itting at meat) be&s;ought the Lord for more &s;ub&s;tantial food than this, which mu&s;t peri&s;h; for the bread of life which comes from heaven; and oh, may we all be &s;o pre&s;erved through life, as to meet in heaven, there is hap|pine&s;s without mixture and without end." At another time &s;oon after one had entered the room (and they being alone) he &s;aid nearly as follows, "I have been made &s;en&s;ible of the nature of ac|ceptable
<PB N="11" REF="027050_0009_0FD37EB694236158">wor&s;hip, through the emblem of the flow|ing and ebbing of the tide, which is by a &s;ecret influence unknown to man; that as the tide flows into rivers, rivulets and creeks, and again re|turns to the ocean, &s;o it is as the love and &s;pirit of God flows into the mind, when reduced into pure &s;ilence, it is in that which returns to the ocean of <HI>(love)</HI> that God is acceptably wor&s;hipped, and there is no other way, therefore I am convinced that Friends are before any other people; and my faith is &s;uch, that tho&s;e who are thus in the fellow&s;hip of one &s;pirit, feel the flowings thereof into one anothers minds: But oh! how have I de&s;pi&s;ed and trampled on the ble&s;&s;ed truth, through a contempt of its &s;mall appearence, as others now do; my &s;en&s;e of the greatne&s;s of my pride and rebellion is &s;uch, that I think my &s;uffering light, and that I &s;hall have further cha&s;ti&s;ement yet; though &s;o it is, in the extreme angui&s;h I am apt to think it is enough."</P>
<P>At another time he &s;aid "There was a per&s;on came to &s;ee me to day (naming him) being a man of note: And another (being one who had been convinced of the truth, and gone from it) and immediately it &s;truck my mind whether I &s;hould not be a&s;hamed of Chri&s;t's words, if any were given me to &s;peak, and, through fear of the &s;hame of the cro&s;s, I began in&s;tantly as words were given; and I have this to &s;ay, truth will comfort the believers, and cau&s;e devils to trem|ble:" And &s;peaking of the one above hinted, that was gone from the truth, &s;aid, "he is en|deavouring to patch up &s;omething, but never will obtain peace until he returns to the place from whence he went out: Truth is over all, and no
<PB N="12" REF="027050_0010_0FD37EBA767C2E60">&s;ub&s;titute will an&s;wer in its room: Many are making to them&s;elves &s;omething they think looks like it, but nothing will an&s;wer but the truth it|&s;elf; it is over all and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it will en|able a man to for&s;ake all: Ten thou&s;and worlds, one upon the back of another, would be no in|ducement to me, to live as I have lived. In the world is pollution, yea, there is <HI>poi&s;on in every vein of it."</HI></P>
<P>At another time he &s;aid, "Oh! that a &s;earch may go through the churches, and none be con|tented with a name, and in the end be di&s;appoint|ed:" At another time he &s;aid, "the help of man is vain, yea, even though they were princes; my tru&s;t and dependence is only on God, who hath power and can help; I am waiting in hopes, that in his own time he will ari&s;e for my help, which will be the be&s;t time: He is ju&s;t, and if he &s;hould ca&s;t me off forever, I feel nothing in me that can &s;ay, what do&s;t thou? If I peri&s;h, it &s;hall be at the feet of his power, begging mercy:" At another time "We are but as children under age, and don't know what is be&s;t for us: We need a wi&s;e and tender parent to guide and direct us, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould know on whom to depend; this keeps us poor and begging."</P>
<P>About two minutes before his departure his brother a&s;king him how it was with him, he &s;aid, "my tru&s;t and dependence is upon a merciful God."</P>
