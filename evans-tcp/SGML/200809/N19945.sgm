<L>AS lately at a Muirland fair,</L>
<L>Where cadgers, tinkers, thieves, repair,</L>
<L>With many others of like cla&s;&s;es;</L>
<L>And mo&s;t of them had with them A&s;&s;es.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To &s;ee how be&s;t they might devi&s;e,</L>
<L>To carry off &s;ome lu&s;ty prize;</L>
<L>The ma&s;ters went to bouze together,</L>
<L>And left their bea&s;ts among the heather;</L>
<L>Where, after picking &s;canty &s;upper,</L>
<L>Each A&s;s &s;at down upon his crupper:</L>
<L>I quite forgot to count them o'er,</L>
<L>But think there might be near three&s;core.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A DARING A&s;s pre&s;um'd to mention,</L>
<L>That now they ought to hold Convention;</L>
<L>And fir&s;t, he mov'd to chu&s;e a Pre&s;es,</L>
<L>(For there's &s;ome order among A&s;&s;es:)</L>

This done, with more than A&s;&s;es fire,</L>
<L>He ro&s;e, and audience did de&s;ire.&mdash;</L>

<LG>
<L>HE &s;aid, my friends, my fellow A&s;&s;es,</L>
<L>Regard we nought what round us pa&s;&s;es;</L>
<L>How other folks their rights maintain,</L>
<L>While we're oppre&s;t and ne'er complain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE &s;acred writers have reported,</L>
<L>How Patriarchs our &s;ervice courted;</L>
<L>We then ate corn, or graz'd in meadows,</L>
<L>But now our riders &s;eldom feed us:</L>
<L>When we for corn to Egypt went,</L>
<L>When Jacob's &s;ons were thither &s;ent,</L>
<L>They trudg'd be&s;ide us on their feet,</L>
<L>And we ate as our ma&s;ters ate.</L>
<L>But hor&s;es now in every land,</L>
<L>Stand in the &s;talls where we &s;hould &s;tand;</L>
<L>Great folks now keep va&s;t numbers by them,</L>
<L>Altho' "forbid to multiply them:"</L>
<L>To us, one hearty feed's a &s;tranger,</L>
<L>While they are full at hack and manger.</L>
<L>The hor&s;e, of more maje&s;tic mien,</L>
<L>With coach and harne&s;s in his train,</L>
<L>They &s;ay, can learn his duty fa&s;ten;</L>
<L>But, where's the hor&s;e e'er taught his ma&s;ter?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>MY friends, we have been long abus'd,</L>
<L>And for the meane&s;t drudg'ry us'd,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="026091_0004_0FCFACA70B4089F8">
While hor&s;es have been kept for plea&s;ure,</L>
<L>And take their airings at their lei&s;ure.</L>
<L>Of old, my friends, it was not thus,</L>
<L>For every great man rode his A&s;s;</L>
<L>And tho' not fram'd to lead in battle,</L>
<L>Yet we were deem'd mo&s;t u&s;eful cattle.</L>
<L>Now hor&s;es get what we de&s;erve,</L>
<L>And we are left to &s;teal or &s;tarve;</L>
<L>Come then, my friends, my hearty bloods,</L>
<L>Let's ri&s;e and kick them from their &s;tuds;</L>
<L>Our cau&s;e is ju&s;t. A few campaigns</L>
<L>Will &s;urely ea&s;e us of our chains.</L>
<L>He ceas'd:&mdash;Each A&s;s &s;tretch'd out his cre&s;t,</L>
<L>And bray'd applau&s;e, and &s;peaker ble&s;t.&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SAVE an old cautious, mod'rate Cuddie,</L>
<L>Who &s;aid he had it from his goodie,</L>
<L>To learn to brook &s;ome &s;mall re&s;traint,</L>
<L>For folks were happy, if content.</L>
<L>I own, my friends, we're not's we have been,</L>
<L>A&s;&s;es have many better days &s;een;</L>

<L>That others are as bad as we.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE former &s;peaker talks of hor&s;es;</L>
<L>What creature under heaven wor&s;e is?</L>
<L>Do ye not &s;ee him plow the field?</L>
<L>And we eat what his labours yield:</L>
<L>By him we have our hay and &s;traw,</L>
<L>Tho' whiles his litter we mu&s;t gnaw,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="026091_0005_0FCFACA5AC3C3BE8">
And, tho' our &s;kins be not &s;o &s;leek,</L>
<L>Yet &s;ome get corn once in a week.</L>
<L>'Tis true, he boa&s;ts of birth and blood,</L>
<L>And &s;prung from this, or that Lord's &s;tud;</L>
<L>But &s;ee ye not how much he's pain'd,</L>
<L>By &s;purs he's driven, by bits re&s;train'd:</L>
<L>See, from his &s;ides how &s;prings the blood,</L>
<L>And oft he faints upon the road:</L>
<L>See what he's forc'd to draw from Leith,</L>
<L>And &s;uff'ring &s;trokes much wor&s;e than death,</L>
<L>Unle&s;s beyond his &s;trengh he draws,</L>
<L>Nor lifts, from morn to night, his jaws.</L>
<L>At other times, he mu&s;t gain&s;ay not,</L>
<L>But face a cannon or a bay'net;</L>
<L>Compar'd with the&s;e, we live in peace,</L>
<L>Our lives are lives of happine&s;s.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YET more, my friends, if we but trace</L>
<L>Our breth'ren of the human race;</L>
<L>I &s;ay, if we but view tho&s;e great ones,</L>
<L>Ev'n tho&s;e who boa&s;t the birth of Britons:</L>
<L>View them with care, and ye will &s;ee,</L>
<L>That they are more oppre&s;t than we.</L>
<L>See how their rulers do oppre&s;s them,</L>
<L>And &s;train their wits how to a&s;&s;e&s;s them,</L>
<L>Soon as they &s;ee the light of day,</L>
<L>They for that light mu&s;t taxes pay;</L>
<L>Nor yet can one a Chri&s;tian be,</L>
<L>Until the King has got his fee;</L>
<L>Nor can be buried when they're dead,</L>

<L>I'VE often heard the farmers &s;ay.</L>
<L>(Be&s;ides what they to landlords pay)</L>
<L>From ev'ry boll there goes a firlot,</L>
<L>To feed &s;ome drone, or great man's harlot.</L>
<L>The hor&s;e he feeds, he cannot ride,</L>
<L>'Till fir&s;t a tax for him be paid;</L>
<L>With tax on beer, and tax on malt,</L>
<L>With tax on &s;pirits and on &s;alt:</L>
<L>With tax on coaches, &s;ervants, rents,</L>
<L>On all the&s;e taxes&mdash;<HI>ten per cents.</HI></L>
<L>And, (what is &s;tranger &s;till to &s;ay)</L>
<L>Tax'd if he &s;hould tho&s;e taxes pay;</L>
<L>Tax'd if he pay his hone&s;t debt,</L>
<L>With &s;tamps for this &s;um, &s;tamps for that:</L>
<L>Tax'd before he dare kill a hare,</L>
<L>Either with dog, or gun, or &s;nare;</L>
<L>Tax'd if o'er pot the news do chat,</L>
<L>And licences for this and that:</L>
<L>With tax on hats, on gloves, and &s;hoes,</L>
<L>Tax'd for the road on which he goes.</L>
<L>For phy&s;ic tax'd&mdash;and tax'd for law;</L>
<L>Tax'd if his wife lie in the &s;traw.</L>
<L>Thus, well and hearty, or relax'd,</L>
<L>Alive, or dead, he mu&s;t be tax'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THESE taxes, when they count them o'er,</L>
<L>Amount to millions near a &s;core;</L>
<L>And of the&s;e millions, not a few,</L>
<L>Are paid to bribe a venal crew.</L>
