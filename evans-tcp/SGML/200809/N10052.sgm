<HEAD>A SERMON.</HEAD>
<P>A SOLEMEN &s;ummons which the Almighty gave, through his prophet Joel, to a people whom he had owned above all the families of the earth, at a time when they had revolted and departed from him, has been revived in my mind, with an appre|hen&s;ion that the &s;ame authority requires the republication of it in this day, to a people likewi&s;e highly favour'd of him, and who have, in like manner, departed from their fir&s;t love.</P>
<P><HI>BLOW the trumpet in Zion, &s;anctify a fa&s;t, call a &s;o|lemn a&s;&s;embly. Gather the people, &s;anctify the congrega|tion, a&s;&s;emble the elders; gather the children, and tho&s;e that &s;uck the brea&s;t: Let the bridegroom go forth of his chambers, and the bride out of her clo&s;et: Let the prie&s;ts, the mini&s;ters of the Lord, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them &s;ay, &s;pare thy people, O Lord! and give not thy heritage to reproach, that the Hea|then &s;hould rule over them; wherefore &s;hould they &s;ay a|mong the people, Where is their God? Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his people.</HI></P>

As I am about to conclude, perhaps finally conclude, my labours among you in this quarter; I would query with &s;ome, with many that are pre&s;ent, whether they have not heard, intelligibly, the &s;ound of the trumpet, calling them, with a degree of certainty, to ari&s;e and prepare them&s;elves for the battle?</P>
<P>My brethren and &s;i&s;ters, among whom I have been con&s;trained, in the overflowings of the Father's love, to labour in a private capacity, breaking, I hope I may &s;ay, a little bread from hou&s;e to hou&s;e; the everla&s;ting go&s;pel has been preached among you with all the force of pathetic energy, with all the tenderne&s;s of divine com|pa&s;&s;ion: Let it not be ineffectual. The go&s;pel me&s;&s;age has been delivered with &s;uch indubitable clearne&s;s, that your judgments have been convinced; you have a&s;&s;ented to the truth as it is in Je&s;us: Suffer not the impre&s;&s;ion it has made upon your minds to be &s;peedily era&s;ed.</P>
<P>FAR, very far, be it from me to think highly of my|&s;elf, to exalt the officer, the mini&s;ter; I would not that you &s;hould hold any man's per&s;on in e&s;timation; I am deeply &s;en&s;ible that to me belongs blu&s;hing and confu&s;i|on of face: But I magnify mine office, and the Power of him who has &s;een meet to employ me therein. I would endeavour to exalt in your view the adorable goodne&s;s and conde&s;cen&s;ion of the great author of all our mercies, in that he has cau&s;ed the trumpet to be renewedly &s;ound|ed in your borders: Hear its important me&s;&s;age with &s;uitable attention; let it rou&s;e and prepare all the ranks in the armies of our Ifrael to engage in the glorious cau&s;e of our God: Let the daughters of our Zion ari&s;e from the bed of indolence, from the lethargic &s;tupor of a fa|tal forgetfulne&s;s; from all the deadening, benumbing
<PB N="7" REF="012770_0004_0F8ABA1F92A0B510">gratifications of &s;en&s;uality, and &s;hake her&s;elf from the du&s;t of the earth, that &s;he may come up to the help of him who hath called her with an high and holy calling.&mdash;The trumpet is blown in her &s;treets&mdash;the a|larm has been heard by all:&mdash;O! Let not its language be rendered unintelligible by the multiplicity of trivial things, that too much ab&s;orb the minds of many. I am fully per&s;uaded, that the gracious vi&s;itation of humb|ling, melting goodne&s;s has been afre&s;h extended to in|dividuals pre&s;ent, in (I had almo&s;t &s;aid a very memora|ble manner) nor will I recall the expre&s;&s;ion; for if it be not trea&s;ured up in your remembrance now, for your profit and advantage, it will be memorable in that awful, approaching period, when every neglected mercy will appear deeply engraven, in a dread hand writing on the wall, again&s;t us: Let me therefore tenderly entreat you with all the warmth of unutterable affection, as a bro|ther, as a fellow pilgrim, through the vici&s;&s;itude of time, to the unmixed joys of a happy eternity, that you will no longer neglect the offers of mercy, or turn a deaf ear to the reproofs of in&s;truction.</P>
<P>I FEEL my mind covered with that boundle&s;s love, that wi&s;hes, that ardently de&s;ires, you may indeed be wi&s;e for your&s;elves; for although I may be deficient in many qualifications of a go&s;pel mini&s;ter. I am not wanting in that pure, di&s;intere&s;ted love which &s;eeks not yours, but you unto the Lord.</P>
<P><HI>Blow the trumpet in Zion; &s;anctify a fa&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>IF we were but enough attentive to the &s;ound of the the trumpet, we &s;hould &s;ee the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of this &s;anctified fa&s;t, a fa&s;t from every of tho&s;e delu&s;ive plea|&s;ures
<PB N="8" REF="012770_0005_0F8ABA2050CF3CE8">&s;ures and &s;lavi&s;h attachments that render the mind in|&s;en&s;ible of good.</P>
<P><HI>Call a &s;olemn a&s;&s;embly.</HI></P>
<P>THIS branch of the &s;ummons &s;ome may think belongs only to a few, and we have no &s;hare in the duty it enjoins. I confe&s;s I am not of that opinion, I think every individual has a &s;hare in the in&s;truction couch'd in it.</P>
<P><HI>Call a &s;olemn a&s;&s;embly.</HI></P>
<P>OH, you active ones! Stop a while in your &s;wift career; make a &s;olemn pau&s;e: Stand collected from every object that can gratify or delight the &s;en&s;ual part: Labour di|ligently to a&s;&s;emble all the powers and faculties of the foul, that they may be &s;anctified by him who gave them. I believe there is no u&s;ele&s;s, dead, unactive member in the church of God; and tho&s;e who can thus a&s;&s;emble the collected attention of a redeemed mind, devoted to the divine will, tho&s;e have an undoubted right from the highe&s;t auth city to call an holy convocation. We can do nothing again&s;t the truth, but for the truth, was the language of &s;ome formerly, who had indeed &s;anctified an acceptable fa&s;t. I mu&s;t de&s;ire that tho&s;e who perhaps cannot be &s;o active in promoting this glorious cau&s;e a|mong the &s;ons of men, as &s;ome who are called into more eminent &s;tations in the Church, may, by a circum&s;pect, care, over all their words and actions, &s;ee that they do nothing again&s;t the truth.</P>
<P><HI>Call a &s;olemn a&s;&s;embly; gather the people.</HI></P>
<P>How &s;cattered are many of the members of this quar|ter? Scattered indeed, as &s;heep without a &s;hepherd, di&s;|per&s;ed
<PB N="9" REF="012770_0005_0F8ABA2050CF3CE8">up and down in the dark vale of in&s;en&s;ibility, and &s;elf-forgetfulne&s;s; many upon the barren mountains of an empty profe&s;&s;ion; lo&s;t to all religious fellow&s;hip, unacquainted with that holy union in which is the bond of peace. How many are the carele&s;s I have met with among&s;t you, who, alas! it may be &s;aid, care for none of tho&s;e things?&mdash;Oh! You elders, who might have been as pillars in the Lord's hou&s;e: You delegated &s;hepherds, who might have adorned the fir&s;t ranks, in the armies of our I&s;rael, if you had not &s;et down and taken up a re&s;t &s;hort of tho&s;e glorious abodes, which are prepared for them who &s;teadily per&s;evere in the line of divine appoint|ment! &mdash;To you the call is,</P>
<P><HI>Gather the people.</HI></P>
<P>AM I my brother's keeper? Let it &s;uffice for me that I look to my&s;elf, and that my own family is in tolerable order, is a language that too much prevails. But Oh! that you had the cau&s;e of God more at heart; that you were more engaged to gather the people; that you might, with a fatherly care, overlook tho&s;e who&s;e minds at pre&s;ent re&s;emble the barren de&s;art, the uncultivated wilderne&s;s; that you might comfort and encourage tho&s;e who tread the gloomy &s;cenes of an adver&s;e allotment, as it were cut out from every joy, and alive to each painful &s;en&s;ibility. How would it comfort many of the&s;e, if an experienced friend was now and then to drop into their fa|milies, and at times &s;peak a word in the openings of di|vine wi&s;dom, &s;uitable to their &s;everal &s;tates? I believe it would be a great means of gathering the people. Why &s;hould your care be circum&s;cribed within the narrow li|mits of your own families, although they might be well regulated? But you might be more exten&s;ively u&s;eful if
<PB N="10" REF="012770_0006_0F8ABA212892CF70">thus engaged in the care of the hou&s;ehold of God: I am per&s;uaded that the divine wing would be over you, and a ble&s;&s;ing would attend your labour. 'Tis not a time for us to dwell unconcerned in our ceiled hou&s;es, when the hou&s;e of God lies wa&s;te; we have many of us the &s;ame tender connexions as you. I my&s;elf have the &s;ame endearing attachments as &s;ome of you, the &s;ame ties of dome&s;tic love as &s;ome of you, not le&s;s attentive to every relative and &s;ocial duty than &s;ome of you; my nature is not har&s;h, my principles much le&s;s &s;o; yet I am made wil|ling to leave all to come and labour with you, if &s;o be I might be in&s;trumental to rou&s;e any to a more arduous pur&s;uit of their everla&s;ting intere&s;t, and I can freely ac|knowledge with humble thankfulne&s;s, that I never more fully experienced my peace to flow as a river, never could with greater joy &s;ay, Return O my &s;oul to the place of thy re&s;t, for the Lord thy God hath dealt bountifully with thee, than when I have been thus engaged in exten|&s;ive private labours, vi&s;iting the &s;ick, reviving the &s;or|rowful, encouraging the di&s;con&s;olate; &s;trengthening the weak, watching over and carefully admoni&s;h|ing the giddy, incautious youth; and I doubt not but you would have the rewards of peace in your own bo&s;oms, if, as heads of the &s;ociety, you were more often thus employed in endeavouring to gather the people.</P>
<P><HI>Sanctify the congregations; a&s;&s;emble the elders.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE been deeply concerned to &s;ee &s;ome of the el|ders &s;o deficient in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ling the line of divine appointment.

<HI>Blow the trumpet in Zion.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I know of no &s;tate harder to &s;peak to, more dif|ficult to reach, than that of an elder, who&s;e mind is over|grown by the earthly nature.</P>
<P><HI>Oh earth, earth, earth! Hear the word of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>I DON'T recollect any other in&s;tance, in &s;acred writ, where attention is demanded in a &s;imilar manner.</P>
<P>OH earth, earth, earth! Thus thrice repeated, plainly &s;ignifying the great difficulty there is in reaching to tho&s;e, who are as it were buried in the earth, who&s;e minds are fixed in it.</P>
<P><HI>Gather the children.</HI></P>
<P>You that have the ri&s;ing youth under your care, let me call upon you, let me entreat you to,&mdash;gather the children:&mdash;Gather them from all the bewitching, enticing allurements of the world; gather their attention to that of God in their own minds. O! How have I &s;ecretly mourn'd to &s;ee the poor children &s;o &s;orrowfully neglected, &s;o unin&s;tructed, &s;o much e&s;tranged from that holy, divine principle which would exceedingly beautity and enrich them? But, alas! How few parents are rightly qualified to teach their children the law of divine love, to in&s;till in|to their tender minds proper &s;entiments, to cultivate up|on them tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions that would be of everla&s;ting advantage;&mdash;and if the children, when the gracious vi&s;ita|tion of the father of mercies moves upon their hearts, warming and animating them with the love of virtue; rai&s;ing the &s;ecret &s;igh, and begetting de&s;ires after heaven
<PB N="12" REF="012770_0007_0F8ABA2447B50D90">and holine&s;s: I &s;ay, if the children &s;hould then a&s;k the negligent parent, What is this &s;ecret &s;omething which I &s;eel; this principle which impre&s;&s;es my mind with the love of virtue? What is it? What value &s;hall I &s;et up|on it? How then can you give them &s;uitable in&s;tructi|on? You cannot teach then obedience to its &s;acred dic|tates, when your own example &s;peaks a language quite oppo&s;ite? Oh! Why &s;hould the &s;ea-mon&s;ter be brought again&s;t you? "The &s;ea-mon&s;ter draweth forth the brea&s;t to the young, but the daughter of my people is become cruel as the o&s;trich in the wilderne&s;s, that leaveth her eggs in the &s;and, to be hatched by the beams of the &s;un, and con&s;idereth not that the foot of the pa&s;&s;enger may cru&s;h them."&mdash;The daughter of my people hath left her ten|der offspring to the uncertainty of being accidentally be|nefited, or, I &s;hould rather &s;ay, to the mercy of God un|a&s;ked, un&s;ought, expo&s;ed to all the dangers of a dreary wilderne&s;s, unaided, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by the care of a natural parent; the tongue of the &s;ucking child cleaveth to the roof of its mouth for thir&s;t; the children a&s;k bread, and there is none, in many families, to break it; they want to be nouri&s;hed by the &s;incere milk of the word; but, alas!</P>
<P><HI>The daughter of my people is become cruel.</HI></P>
<P>OH you parents, you delegated &s;hepherds! What ac|count will you have to render when the Lord of the whole earth ari&s;eth to make inqui&s;ition for blood? Bear with me my dear friends; &s;lattery and &s;mooth tales may plea&s;e fools, but they will not plea&s;e him whom I de&s;ire to &s;erve in the go&s;pel of his &s;on. All that is within me is moved while I thus earne&s;tly expo&s;tulate with you on behalf of the dear children; &s;uffer me to entreat you for God's &s;ake,
<PB N="13" REF="012770_0007_0F8ABA2447B50D90">for your own &s;oul's &s;ake, for the &s;ake of the cau&s;e of truth, <HI>Gather the children, and tho&s;e that &s;uck the brea&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>THOSE who are filling them&s;elves with the world's con&s;olation, with the intoxicating plea&s;ures and amu&s;e|ments of a degenerate age; wean them from tho&s;e de|lights: Gather them to the knowledge of them&s;elves, to a &s;en&s;e of the mercies that are offered them by the great author of mercies, ancient and new.</P>
<P>WHILE thy &s;ervant was bu&s;ied hither and thither, the man made his e&s;cape,&mdash;was the vain excu&s;e of the officer to who&s;e cu&s;tody a certain captive was committed, with the charge, "Take care of this man till I come, and if thou let him go, thy life &s;hall go for his life." No plea of other engagements, nor even want of ability to di&s;|charge our duty towards our offspring, will &s;tand us in &s;tead, if when the Almighty queries with us,&mdash;What ha&s;t thou done with tho&s;e lambs I left under thy care in the wilderne&s;s, tho&s;e tender offsprings I gave thee in charge?&mdash;We have through neglect, through unwatch|fulne&s;s, &s;uffered him or her to go; but we &s;hall mo&s;t cer|tainly &s;tand accountable for his or her life,&mdash;I &s;aid want of ability, becau&s;e I a&s;&s;uredly believe, that want of ability will be &s;o far from a palliation of our crime, that it will rather increa&s;e our condemnation. Can we plead want of ability to him who is always ready to furni&s;h us with it, if we are but willing to receive it at his hand? I am of opinion with re&s;pect to many of our youth, that if they had been properly in&s;tructed and carefully watched over, if they could have &s;een the beauty of holine&s;s &s;hine in the example of their parents, they would not have gone out &s;o widely as they have.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="012770_0008_0F8ABA24CDC4B438">
O YOU parents of both fexes! An important duty is repo&s;ed in you. Example your children in the practice of piety. Example &s;peaks louder than precept, its influ|ence is far more exten&s;ive, and while on the one hand you are excited to a faithful di&s;charge of your duty towards them, by the certain hope of a glorious reward; &s;o on the other hand the powerful ties of natural affection, the warm &s;olicitude for the happine&s;s of tho&s;e you love, mu&s;t &s;tir up to diligence in the work and <HI>&s;ervice appointed you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gather the children.</HI></P>
<P>IF after your attentive care has been employed for their pre&s;ervation; if after the forcible voice of example, you have called them to the perfecting of holine&s;s in the fear of God, they will go, they will turn a&s;ide, into the by ways &amp; crooked paths of &s;in &amp; iniquity, they mu&s;t &s;tand by their own choice. You will have redeemed your &s;ouls &amp; will be found in your lots at the end of time. A ponderous crown awaits; you will clo&s;e your eyes, and open them to the boundle&s;s fruition of unmixed joy, in a happy eter|nity. We do &s;ometimes with &s;orrow ob&s;erve the unwea|ried labours of a parent's love, be&s;towed without the de&s;i|red effect: 'Tis mournful to &s;ee children pierce with bitterne&s;s and anxiety the brea&s;t that has been their &s;up|port, in their infantile years; to fill that eye with &s;orrow, that has dropt over them the tear of maternal tender|ne&s;s; 'tis a cruel thing for a child to mingle gall and wormwood in the cup of a parent de&s;cending to the grave! Let &s;uch be a&s;&s;ured that their own portion of gall and wormwood will be doubly increa&s;ed thereby, in the &s;olemn hour of ju&s;t retribution.</P>
<P>BUT Oh, beloved youth! I earne&s;tly de&s;ire that you
<PB N="15" REF="012770_0008_0F8ABA24CDC4B438">may never thus widely deviate from the paths of rectitude 'Tis on you the hopes of the pre&s;ent age mu&s;t &s;hortly devolve: May you wi&s;ely chu&s;e an early &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the holy di&s;cipline of the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, that you may come up as an army for God. Con&s;ider the uncertainty of your &s;tay here: Con&s;ider the important bu&s;ine&s;s of life, and let the love of every unprofitable delight be &s;wallowed up in the arduous pur&s;uit of glory, honor, immortality, and eternal life. We are daily in&s;tructed by the powerful, eloquent language of mortality. Death invades all ranks, &s;natches tho&s;e of all ages from the bu|&s;y &s;tage of life.&mdash;She who was ye&s;terday &s;urrounded with nuptial joys mu&s;t, to-morrow, be confined within the cold inclo&s;ure of the &s;ilent grave.</P>
<P><HI>"Let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her clo&s;et."</HI></P>
<P>LET the young be joyous, and tho&s;e who are in the bloom of life leave every thing that tends to retard their progre&s;s towards the city of the &s;aints &s;olemnity: Let them relinqui&s;h their mo&s;t exalted &s;atisfactions, rather than neglect to lay hold on the joys of God's &s;alvation, which are unutterably more de&s;irable than all the &s;in-plea&s;ing gratifications that this world can be&s;tow.</P>
<P><HI>'Let the prie&s;ts, the mini&s;ters of the Lord, weep between the porch and the altar.'</HI></P>
<P>THIS &s;hould not be confined to tho&s;e only who&s;e mouths may be opened publicly among&s;t you; for it be|longs to all tho&s;e who preach to others by the regularity of a godly life and conver&s;ation, although we are favour|ed with a living mini&s;try of divine appointment, who dare
<PB N="16" REF="012770_0009_0F8ABA258D413428">not fill the ears of men with a repetition of unfelt truths nor amu&s;e them with the unprofitable productions of an empty mind; but are concerned to di&s;charge them&s;elves faithfully, as &s;tewards of the my&s;teries of God; yet let them be joined by all tho&s;e that mourn for the de&s;olation of Zion, by all who wi&s;h peace within her walls, and pro&s;|perity within her palaces.</P>
<P><HI>Let us weep between the porch and the altar, &s;aying,&mdash; Spare thy people, O Lord! And give not thy heritage to re|proach, that the heathen &s;hould rule over them; wherefore &s;hould they &s;ay among the people,&mdash;Where is their God?"</HI></P>
<P>IF we are thus unitedly engaged in behalf of our If|rael, it may be that the Lord will again be jealous over his land, with an holy jealou&s;y; for I cannot think that a peo|ple whom he has rai&s;ed by his invincible power, and &s;o &s;ignally placed his name among&s;t, were ever de&s;igned to be only the tran&s;ient glory of a couple of centuries.&mdash; I am &s;till revived by a &s;ecret hope of better times, when our Zion &s;hall again put on her beautiful garments, and in her and with her &s;hall ari&s;e judges, as at the fir&s;t, and coun&s;ellors, as at the beginning. Let us weep between the porch and the altar; let us interceed for the people, that the land may yet be &s;pared. The gracious ear of our heavenly Father is &s;till open to the &s;upplications of his children, and I believe he will yet be jealous over his land, and pity his people.</P>
<P>THE time approaches when the great da&s;her in pieces will more and more come up among&s;t us; and may all, who are broken by him, wait to be healed by the ari&s;ing of his love: I &s;hall not live to &s;ee it, but I live in the faith, and I believe I &s;hall die in the faith, that the Lord
<PB N="17" REF="012770_0009_0F8ABA258D413428">of Ho&s;ts will yet beautify the place of his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word"> our Zion will yet become an eternal excellency, and Jeru&s;a|lem the prai&s;e of the whole earth.</P>
<P><HI>Let us weep between the porch and the altar, for the Lord will yet be jealous over his land, and pity his people.</HI></P>
<P>THE bowels of adorable conde&s;cen&s;ion yet yearn over his children, with all the tenderne&s;s of a Father's love.</P>
<P>How &s;hall I give thee up, O Ephraim? How &s;hall I make thee as Admah, and &s;et thee as Zeboim?&mdash;How &s;hall I cut thee off from being a people before me?</P>
<P>BY this moving and pathetic language would the great Father of the univer&s;e induce you to return to the arms of everla&s;ting mercy; and if we are placed as watchmen in Zion, faithfully di&s;charge the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in us, we &s;hall be made in&s;trumental in gathering the &s;cattered and di&s;per&s;ed &s;heep, from the ea&s;t and from the we&s;t, from the north and from the &s;outh, to the great &s;hepherd, to the one &s;heepfold, and finally obtain an ad|mittance into tho&s;e glorious man&s;ions, where the morning &s;tars join in &s;inging hallelujahs! And where all the &s;ons of God for ever &s;hout for joy.</P>
<P>Now unto the King eternal, immortal and invi&s;ible, the only God, be honor and prai&s;e, for ever and ever!</P>
