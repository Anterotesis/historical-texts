<PB REF="037103_0002_100D32690D52DF98">
<HEAD>The following charge was delivered at the close of the pleadings, by the Hon. Judge Shippen.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS is an action brought by the Plaintiff again&s;t the Defendant for writing, printing and publi&s;hing divers &s;candalous libels, to defame and villify him. The defendant has pleaded that he is not guilty;&mdash;his coun&s;el, however have acknowledged the publication of the pa|pers, which, otherwi&s;e, it would have been incumbent on the plaintiff to prove. The que&s;tion, therefore, will be, whether they amount in law to defamatory libels or not?</P>
<P>By the law and practice in England, in the ca&s;e of libels, the only ta&s;k of the jury is, to judge of the fact of publication, and the truth and fair application of the inuendos. The court, as judges of the law, re&s;erving to them&s;elves the &s;ole power of deciding whether the paper amounts to a libel or not: But in this &s;tate, by the &s;pecial di|rections of our con&s;titution, the jury po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of judging both of the law and fact, under the direction of the court.</P>
<P>A libel is defined by the law, to be the malicious defamation, ex|pre&s;&s;ed either in printing or writing, or by &s;igns or pictures, tending to blacken either the memory of one who is dead, or the reputation of one who is alive, or to expo&s;e him to public hatred, contempt or ridi|cule. This offence may be puni&s;hed, either by indictment at the &s;uit of the commonwealth, or by a civil action at the &s;uit of the party inju|red. When the pro&s;ecution is by indictment, the court only are to direct the puni&s;hment; but is a civil &s;uit, the damages are to be a&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;olely by the jury.</P>
<P>The charges laid again&s;t the defendant in the declaration, are vari|ous; but they may be reduced in &s;ub&s;tance to the following.&mdash;That he repeatedly calls the plaintiff a quack, an empyric; charges him with intemperate bleeding, injudiciou&s;ly admini&s;tering Mercury in large do&s;es in the yellow-fever; puffing him&s;elf off; writing letters and an|&s;wering them him&s;elf, &s;tiling him the Samp&s;on in Medicine; charg|ing him with murdering his patients and &s;laying his thou&s;ands, and tens of thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>The counts laid in the declaration is full proved by the publications which are certainly libellous. In what manner do the defendant's coun&s;el repel the&s;e proofs? Not by ju&s;tifying the truth of the matters charged again&s;t Dr. Ru&s;h, which on the contrary they have repeatedly acknowledged to be fal&s;e, but by analyzing the &s;everal allegations in the new&s;papers, and from thence drawing a conclu&s;ion that no inten|tional per&s;onal malice appears, which they &s;ay is the e&s;&s;ence of the offence.&mdash;Malice re&s;ts in the heart, and is only to be judged of by the words and actions of the party; the words them&s;elves import malice, and in that ca&s;e the proof lies on the defendant to &s;hew the innocence of his intentions; if he has done THAT to your &s;atisfaction, you will acquit him; but as this is chiefly founded on the allegation that the attack was meant to be made on Dr. Ru&s;h's <HI>System,</HI> and not on the <HI>Man;</HI> it unfortunately appears that not the lea&s;t attempt is made to combat the Doctor's arguments with regard to the &s;y&s;tem it&s;elf, but the attack is made merely by gro&s;s &s;currilous abu&s;e of the Doctor him|&s;elf:
<PB REF="037103_0003_100D326C383150A0">
Added to this, one of the witne&s;&s;es proves a declaration made by the defendant, that if Dr. Ru&s;h had not been the <HI>Man</HI> he &s;hould never have meddled with the <HI>System.</HI></P>
<P>Another ground of defence is of a more &s;erious nature, as it leads to an important que&s;tion on our con&s;titution&mdash;it is &s;aid that the &s;ubject of di&s;pute between the plaintiff and defendant was a matter of public concern, as it related to the health and lives of our fellow citizens, and that by the words of our con&s;titution, every man has a right to di&s;cu&s;s &s;uch &s;ubjects in print. The liberty of the pre&s;s, gentlemen, is a valu|able right in every free country, and ought never to be unduly re&s;train|ed; but when it is perverted to the purpo&s;es of private &s;lander, it then becomes a mo&s;t de&s;tructive engine in the hands of unprincipled men; the utmo&s;t purity and integrity of heart, is no &s;hield again&s;t the &s;hafts and arrows of malice, conveyed to the world by printed publications. Verbal &s;lander may be frequently very injurious, but &s;lander writing or print being more generally di&s;&s;eminated and more durable in its ef|fects, is con&s;equently infinitely more pernicious and provoking. Our &s;tate con&s;titution of 1790, contains certainly very general words with relation to the right of a citizen to print his thoughts and offer them to the con&s;ideration of the public, but it at the &s;ame time guard again&s;t the generality of the privilege, by expre&s;sly declaring, that every per|&s;on availing him&s;elf of the liberty of the pre&s;s, <HI>should be responsible for the abuse of that liberty;</HI> thus &s;ecuring to our citizens the invaluable right of reputation again&s;t every malicious invader of it.</P>
<P>Printed publications attacking private character, is con&s;idered with great rea&s;on by the law as a very atrocious offence, from its evident tendency to the breach of the public peace&mdash;if men find they can have no redre&s;s in our courts of ju&s;tice for &s;uch injuries, they will naturally take &s;atisfaction in their own way, involving perhaps their friends and families in the conte&s;t, and leading evidently to duels, Murders, and perhaps to A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations.</P>
<P>The principal &s;ubject of con&s;ideration with the jury will be, what damages they are to a&s;&s;e&s;s. On this &s;ubject you are the almo&s;t un|controllable judges&mdash;it is your peculiar province:&mdash;The court have in|deed the power to order a new trial where damages are exce&s;&s;ive; but in ca&s;es of torts and injuries of this kind, the law books &s;ay the dama|ges mu&s;t be &s;o outrageou&s;ly di&s;proportionate to the offence, as at fir&s;t blu&s;h to &s;hock every per&s;on who hears of it, before the court will order a new trial.</P>
<P>Every one mu&s;t know that offences of this kind have for &s;ome time pa&s;t too much abounded in our city; it &s;eems high time to re&s;train them&mdash;that ta&s;k is with you, Gentlemen. To &s;uppre&s;s &s;o great an evil, it will not only be proper to give compen&s;atory, but exemplary damages; thus &s;topping the growing progre&s;s of this daring crime&mdash;at the &s;ame time, the damages &s;hould not be &s;o enormous as ab&s;olutely to ruin the offender.</P>
<P>I hope no party con&s;iderations will ever have place in this court in the admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice&mdash;and I intreat you, Gentlemen, to bani&s;h them, in con&s;idering this &s;ubject, entirely from your brea&s;ts.</P>
<P>The Jury, after an ab&s;ence of two hours, brought in a verdict in favor of the Plaintiff of <HI>Five Thousand Dollars.</HI></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>Tho&s;e who are in the habit of looking over the Gazettes, which come in from the different parts of the country, mu&s;t have ob&s;erved, and with no &s;mall degree of indignation, the arts that our remor&s;e|le&s;s <HI>Bleeder</HI> is making u&s;e of to puff off his prepo&s;terous practice. He has, unfortunately, his partizans in almo&s;t every quarter of the coun|try. To the&s;e he writes letters, and in return gets letters from them: he extols their practice, and they extol his; and there is &s;carcely a page of any new&s;paper that I &s;ee, which has the good fortune to e&s;|cape the poi&s;on of their pre&s;criptions.&mdash;Blood, blood! &s;till they cry more blood!&mdash;In every &s;entence they menace our poor veins. Their language is as frightful to the ears of the alarmed multitude, as is the raven's croak to tho&s;e of the &s;ickly flock.</P>
<P>Among all the&s;e puffs, I do not recollect a more &s;hamele&s;s one than the following from Dr. TILTON.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>Extract of a letter from Dr. Tilton, of Wilmington, to Dr. Rush, dated September 12.</HEAD>
<P>We have had repeated in&s;tances of <HI>your fever</HI> at this place. The infection has generally been taken in Philadelphia, I am not ac|quainted with any in&s;tances where the contagion has been received
<PB REF="037103_0005_100D3270B47BBEC8">
at Wilmington, but at Newca&s;tle and Newport there are unequivo|cal examples of the contagion being received from tho&s;e who brought it from the city.</P>
<P>In the treatment of the fever we u&s;e <HI>copious</HI> blood-letting in the beginning, and active <HI>mercurial purges.</HI> I have conceived however, that mercury is u&s;eful, not merely as a cathartic, but as <HI>a specific against all kinds of contagion.</HI>&mdash;There is no contagious di&s;ea&s;e in which its u&s;e is not acknowledged: not only &s;mall-pox, mea&s;les, dy&s;entery, &amp;c. but &s;carlitina and influenza yield to its &s;pecific vir|tues. You probably remember as well as I, that it was given with advantage in the ho&s;pital and camp fever. In &s;hort, I have e&s;ta|bli&s;hed it as a maxim, to give mercury as &s;oon as I know a di&s;|ea&s;e to be contagious.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>This Dr. Tilton is a kind of a puritan; a four wry-faced incorri|gible democrat. He has the pride of Lucifer him&s;elf, and, to me, it is a&s;toni&s;hing that he &s;hould have conde&s;cended to become the trumpet, the underling, the mere barber-&s;urgeon of the ma&s;ter-bleeder.</P>
<P>The mercurial purges too, Dr. Tilton mu&s;t break forth in prai&s;e of! Mercury is good for every thing that is contagious! Is good for &s;an&s;|culloti&s;m Doctor? If it be, in the name of goodne&s;s, take a double do&s;e of it twice a day, 'till it has wrought a cure.&mdash;Dr. Ru&s;h, in that emphatical &s;tile which is peculiar to him&s;elf, calls <HI>Mercury</HI> "the <HI>Sam|son</HI> of medicine." In his hands and in tho&s;e of his partizans it may indeed be ju&s;tly compared to <HI>Samson;</HI> for, I verily believe they have &s;lain more Americans with it, than ever Sam&s;on &s;lew of the Phili&s;|tines. The I&s;raelite &s;lew his thou&s;ands, but the Ru&s;hites have &s;lain their tens of thou&s;ands.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I find my ra&s;cally ho&s;tler has forgot the frequent injunctions I have given him, to mind his bu&s;ine&s;s, and has de&s;erted his curry comb and bru&s;h, for the pen and ink.</P>
<P>John is a very good man in his way, and under&s;tands his bu&s;ine&s;s well, particularly the art of bleeding hor&s;es; when I propo&s;ed to my brethren to commence bu&s;ine&s;s as phy&s;ician, I had an eye on John's abilities as a bleeder, and I hinted to him my intention. Would you believe it Mr. P&mdash;that the ra&s;cal after reading my e&s;&s;ay in your paper, purcha&s;ed <HI>"Dr. Rush on the Yellow Fever,"</HI> and has been &s;tudy|ing ever &s;ince, to my great lo&s;s and mortification. And now the wi&s;e illiterate thinks he can commence bu&s;ine&s;s for him&s;elf. But let him remember that <HI>"Ne sutor ultra crepidem," The cobler must not go be|yond his last.</HI> I ob&s;erve he is half a phy&s;ician already, for he has got the <HI>Cocoe iters scribendi</HI>&mdash;and has obliged the public with his fir&s;t medical e&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P><PB REF="037103_0006_100D32740CADC5F8">
Not content with de&s;erting my &s;ervice, he appears de&s;irous to pre|judice the public again&s;t me, and my brethren, a&s;&s;erting in &s;trong terms, that we are enemies to the <HI>noble science of blood-letting:</HI> This is abominable and contrary to the truth. For I am, and &s;hall be <HI>no|lens volens,</HI> an advocate for the practice, and it is my creed that it will cure all di&s;ea&s;es&mdash;as our good allies the French have clearly pro|ved in their practice,&mdash;I have al&s;o another rea&s;on for commencing the bu&s;ine&s;s of a phy&s;ician; In fact, the villainous liquors my wine mer|chant obliges me to &s;upply my gue&s;ts with, has lately cau&s;ed in the latter &s;evere and har&s;h expo&s;tulations, and, as I am a con&s;cientious man, I wi&s;h to follow a quiet bu&s;ine&s;s, and I prefer that of the lancet, be|cau&s;e you know Mr. P. <HI>dead men never tell tales.</HI></P>
<P>As I have now cautioned your readers, and I conceive the public again&s;t my ra&s;cally ho&s;tler, I have to ob&s;erve to you, that a meeting of our brethren was held at my tavern la&s;t evening; when the bu&s;i|ne&s;s I had recommended was very warmly approved; and a college was determined to be held the en&s;uing week, for the purpo&s;e of taking out our diplomas.&mdash;And it was unanimou&s;ly agreed to reque&s;t, Dr. J. Redman Coxe to favor us with a prefatory oration in prai&s;e of the noble &s;cience of blood-letting. We al&s;o voted a &s;erious expo&s;tulation to the public, on their prejudices again&s;t the new practice addre&s;&s;ed to Dr. Ru&s;h, the great patron of the art.</P>
<P>As our re&s;olves will appear in your paper, I think it unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate more at pre&s;ent, than that we determined not to adverti&s;e the particular taverns where compounds may be had; as we believed each of our brethren was well qualified in that re&s;pect. The &s;uperior me|rits of &s;ome, who &s;ell &s;tale porter, dead cider, &amp;c. will be &s;oon di&s;co|vered by their re&s;pective patients.</P>
<P>I have already got my carriage newly painted, and have engaged a <HI>French</HI> ho&s;tler, who&s;e merits and <HI>sang froid</HI> in the u&s;e of the lancet are I believe, unrivalled, for I believe he was an <HI>eleve</HI> of Robe&s;|pierre.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o hired a few nur&s;es, who&s;e abilities I am well acquainted with. They will never de&s;ert their patients, as I have engaged to &s;up|ply them con&s;tantly with excellent gin and have al&s;o promi&s;ed them the pillage of &s;uch of my patients who may be determined to die.</P>

<P>In reading thy paper of the 19th in&s;tant, I took notice of a curious ob&s;ervation made on a certain rye faced incorrigible democrat, one of the medical puffers. To complete the &s;tory, I will give thee a &s;hort &s;ketch of a curious fact (which happened &s;ome time pa&s;t in this place) concerning this &s;elf con&s;equent Mercurial gho&s;t.</P>
<P>There was a woman travelling from the head of Elk to German|town, and on her way her carriage was turned over, &s;he thrown out, and very much hurt, She has &s;ince returned from Germantown through Philadelphia, and made a &s;top at an inn, in this borough;&mdash;the woman overcome with fatigue and a cold &s;he had taken, felt her|&s;elf a little indi&s;po&s;ed.</P>
<P>This crooked faced Quack was called in. As &s;oon as he &s;aw her, he &s;aid he mu&s;t take &s;ome BLOOD, and I &s;uppo&s;e, if he had not got frightened, a good do&s;e of mercury would have en&s;ued.</P>
<P>But fortunate for the poor woman, he happened to pu&s;h up her &s;leeve a little, and di&s;covered a brui&s;e on her arm, which &s;he received in her fall from the carriage. Alarmed at the appearance of her arm, he a&s;ked her if &s;he had been to Philadelphia, the reply was, yes: he im|mediately pronounced her complaints to be the <HI>Yellow Fever,</HI> made his e&s;cape and has not &s;een her &s;ince. The good woman has recovered and proceeded on her way home. There now lies a per&s;on, a &s;mall di&s;tance from the town, in a hou&s;e (built for the reception of per&s;ons coming here with the contagion) who he pronounced to have the yel|low fever. But, who in fact, has nothing but the common ague.</P>

<P>The action now before you is an action of &s;lander, brought by Dr. Benjamin Ru&s;h, who has long been a di&s;tingui&s;hed ornament of our city, again&s;t William Cobbett, the printer and publi&s;her of a new&s;paper under the name of <HI>Porcupine's Gazette.</HI> It will ea&s;ily be imagined that no &s;light cau&s;e could bring a man of Dr. Ru&s;h's character into this, or any other competition, with a man of William Cobbett's character.&mdash;Dr. Ru&s;h is as well known for his peaceful habits and his amiable manners, as William Cobbett is for his di&s;ocial malignant di&s;po&s;ition and inveterate hate&mdash;While the one may well be termed the friend of humanity, the other has labored hard to be con&s;idered, <HI>hostis humani generis</HI>&mdash;It is not then to indulge a fondne&s;s for controver&s;y&mdash;It is not to gratify un&s;ocial, litigious or revengeful di&s;po&s;itions, for no &s;uch find a place in his heart, that Dr. Ru&s;h now pre&s;ents him&s;elf before the tribunal of his country, demanding ju&s;tice for barbarous and unprovok|ed injuries, and requiring that protection of an hone&s;t reputation which the law guarantees to every citizen&mdash;He comes here impre&s;&s;ed with high duties&mdash;To THE LAWS OF HIS COUNTRY he owes a duty, that they &s;hall not be violated;&mdash;TO HIS FELLOW CITIZENS he owes a duty to bring to puni&s;hment, and, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;uppre&s;s an abandoned and dangerous offender, who tramples over truth, decency and charact|er with a tiger's &s;tride, and a&s;&s;aults with venomous fury the mo&s;t &s;acred bands of &s;ocial order and peace; the mo&s;t endearing ties of private life and happine&s;s&mdash;TO HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY, he owes a duty of <HI>protection,</HI> which &s;hould never be di&s;regarded&mdash;let the father of a family a&s;&s;ert the honor and purity that it de&s;cend not as a &s;hame upon his children.&mdash;Let the hu&s;band pre&s;erve the tender feelings of a wife from in&s;ult, and her affections from the deep wounds of public re|proach.</P>
<P>On this high and dignified ground, Dr. Ru&s;h &s;tands before you&mdash;He appeals to his country in firm confidence in its ju&s;tice, and it is your province, Gentlemen, to admini&s;ter that ju&s;tice&mdash;you are to a&s;cer|tain the &s;ecurity in which a citizen of Penn&s;ylvania holds his good name, and to &s;anction or to check the ravages of defamation&mdash;This day we are to know whether character is deemed a valuable and &s;acred po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion among us, in which we have a perfect and inviolable right,
<PB REF="037103_0010_100D327C9E393A78">
or whether it is to be the mere &s;port and play-thing of malicious ridi|cule and vulgar wit, the undefended victim of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating malevo|lence; we are now to know if honor and virtue are known and re&s;pect|ed here; if a fair and unimpreached life, of above fifty years, &s;pent in im|portant public &s;ervices, and the con&s;tant exerci&s;e of private virtues, has a good claim to protection from premeditated ruin, and &s;hall not &s;ue for redre&s;s in vain.</P>
<P>The courts of ju&s;tice are &s;o often harra&s;&s;ed with actions of &s;lander, brought for trifling or revengeful cau&s;es, originating in pa&s;&s;ion, and ending in repentance,&mdash;founded on the quarrels of children, or the un|meaning intemperance of harmle&s;s old women, that they have fallen into &s;ome kind of di&s;repute, and lo&s;t much of that importance, which the law and good rea&s;on attaches to them, when properly founded.&mdash;In fact, it &s;eldom happens, that the kind of &s;lander which the law &s;o &s;e|riou&s;ly contemplates, occurs&mdash;The offence is &s;o enormous, &s;o de&s;titute of palliation or defence, &s;o unworthy, &s;o low and dete&s;table, the penal|ty &s;o exemplary, that few men are found regardle&s;s enough of &s;ocial order and decency, or &s;ufficiently outrageous and audacious to commit it. But when &s;uch a ca&s;e does occur, it ri&s;es in terrible pre-eminence above the multitude of actions for defamation which throng the dockets and di&s;grace the remedy.&mdash;When an offender is found hardy enough to a&s;&s;ault the &s;acred fortre&s;s of reputation, and &s;trive to po&s;trate it in the du&s;t; hardy enough to brave the vengeance denounced again&s;t him by God and man, he &s;hould be &s;truck with dreadful and &s;peedy ju&s;tice, and &s;tand a blighted picture of ruin and infamy, an awful le&s;&s;on to de|pravity and vice.&mdash;Such an offender, we a&s;&s;ert, is William Cobbett; and if &s;uch an offender we &s;hew him to be, we tru&s;t that &s;uch a puni&s;h|ment awaits him.&mdash;</P>
<P>[Here Mr. Hopkin&s;on read the declaration.]</P>
<P>You ob&s;erve, Gentlemen, that the controver&s;y between the plain|tiff and defendant in this cau&s;e, does not originate in any di&s;pute a|bout property; it is a que&s;tion of CHARACTER. And, as in its e&s;|&s;ence, it differs from &s;uits on que&s;tions of property, &s;o mu&s;t it in its mode of treatment, and in its objects of enquiry&mdash;While the defen|dant be permitted to a certain extent to &s;crutinize and inve&s;tigate the character and conduct of the plaintiff (to which inve&s;tigation Dr. Ru&s;h mo&s;t cheerfully offers him&s;elf) we &s;hall al&s;o claim a right of examin|ing or ob&s;erving upon, to a certain extent, the character and conduct of the defendant.&mdash;His <HI>character,</HI> as far as relates to his occupation of a printer and publi&s;her; and his <HI>conduct,</HI> as far as relates to the ge|neral management of his new&s;paper, are &s;urely proper objects of ob|&s;ervation at lea&s;t&mdash;Nothing can be more evident; nothing more rea|&s;onable. If the general character of his pre&s;s is that of decency, of tenderne&s;s for reputation, of candor, liberality and truth, and he has now, as if by accident, fallen into per&s;onal defamation, it will certain|ly be urged by his coun&s;el, as a powerful extenuation of his offence, as a &s;trong argument to induce you to believe that this &s;ingle devia|tion is error, and not crime, is ignorance and not malignity&mdash;The plea would mo&s;t ju&s;tly, hold a powerful influence over your judgments: and
<PB REF="037103_0011_100D3280D8CDF1F0">
although in the &s;trict eye of the law, the only que&s;tion in this action is on the &s;pecific charge of &s;lander, exhibited in the declaration, yet the con&s;truction of tho&s;e charges&mdash;the <HI>quo animo</HI> or di&s;po&s;ition with which the offen&s;ive paragraphs were written and publi&s;hed, will depend much on the general character and conduct of the defendant as a prin|ter, and will have a &s;trong influence over the verdict of an equitable jury.</P>
<P>Permit me gentlemen one further explanation&mdash;Parties have in our country, become wrought up to &s;uch illiberal fury, that every action of a man's life, from the mo&s;t important to the mo&s;t ob&s;cure and trifl|ing is traced to party motives and party principles&mdash;His attachments and his enmities&mdash;his connexions in bu&s;ine&s;s or otherwi&s;e, nay almo&s;t the color of the cloth he wears, and the &s;pecies of diet he feeds on, are a&s;cribed to his party and political principles&mdash;This is an unhappy &s;tate of things&mdash;Were I of the party to whom it has <HI>happened</HI> the defend|ant has oppo&s;ed him&s;elf&mdash;I &s;hould expect that all I &s;hall now or ever &s;ay again&s;t this man, would by many of my fellow-citizens, perhaps by you gentlemen, be deemed to be the mere vengeance of party &s;pirit, the unmanly gratification of political hatred&mdash;But my opinions of this man have ever, even from the commencement of his extraordinary ca|reer, been the &s;ame; and are now, as they always have been, hone&s;t, con&s;i&s;tent, and con&s;cientious&mdash;My political character depends not in the &s;lighte&s;t degree, upon his recommendation or his cen&s;ure&mdash;I have had both; I have regarded neither&mdash;Doubtle&s;s his dark and virulent &s;pirit prepares &s;ome attack, which his in&s;ufferable arrogance informs him will be formidable and de&s;tructive to lawyers, court and jury, that &s;hall dare <HI>to do him justice.</HI> For my&s;elf I declare, if the declaration be nece&s;&s;ary, that there is not in the bounds of creation that thing &s;o feeble or &s;o vile that I &s;hould hold it in greater contempt than the re&s;entment of Wil|liam Cobbett; and, I will an&s;wer that you will not be driven from your duty or your oaths, by a fear of being placed on his <HI>black list.</HI> He has indeed, the unquenchable and vindictive &s;pirit of an inqui&s;itor, but wanting all power, it is harmle&s;s and contemptible&mdash;The ridiculous vanity of this man, and his ignorance of his <HI>true situation</HI> in this country and of the <HI>kind of value or use</HI> that has been put upon him, has lead him into an opinion that his voice is the voice of fate, either with regard to public mea&s;ures and character, or to private reputation. This however is an error which it lies with the public to correct; and they will find their intere&s;t and their honor, deeply concerned in doing it &s;peedily and effectually. God forbid that my country &s;hould have &s;unk &s;o low, that an oppo&s;ition to &s;uch a wretch as this, will be deem|ed unfriendly to our government. When tempe&s;ts agitate the ocean to its foundation, and rock it in convul&s;ions, numerous noxious animals are thrown up, which would otherwi&s;e never have &s;een the light; &s;o in a troubled &s;tate of things, wretches are ca&s;t up from the very dregs and &s;lime of the community, who, in more happy times, would have li|ved and rotted in ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>The attack made on Dr. Ru&s;h is of the mo&s;t deadly and violent kind that malice could invent, or abandoned depravity execute&mdash;He is
<PB REF="037103_0012_100D3282B4CAB1B8">
accu&s;ed of murder, or de&s;troying the lives of his fellow citizens, in a time of dreadful calamity&mdash;It is then fair and nece&s;&s;ary to enquire&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. What was the conduct of Doctor Ru&s;h during that calamity&mdash;has it merited reproach or applau&s;e&mdash;If the former, the offence of W. C. is extenuated, though not ju&s;tified; if the latter, it is aggra|vated beyond all example.</P>
<P N="2">2. What inducement or motive had W. C. for this attack&mdash;If a de|&s;ire to inform the public mind on an intere&s;ting &s;ubject, his offence is extenuated, but not ju&s;tified&mdash;if private and political malice, it is aggravated.</P>
<P>Dr. Ru&s;h's reputation is not confined to the narrow circle of his pa|tients, nor his applau&s;e to the clamours of old women and nur&s;es. His fame has &s;pread as exten&s;ively as our commerce. He has added a fre&s;h and a blooming laurel to the head of American genius&mdash;he has done much to re&s;cue the American name from obloquy and contempt, which &s;ome of the proud Philo&s;ophers of Europe would ca&s;t upon us, ranking us as inferior to them&s;elves in the order of beings. From the Ea&s;t In|dies and from the We&s;t&mdash;from almo&s;t every part of Europe, he has re|ceived honors and compliments; and we are different from all the peo|ple on the face of the earth, if the&s;e honors reflect not &s;ome pride and &s;ome plea&s;ure into our brea&s;ts.&mdash;This participation in the honors and fame of our countrymen is coeval with the exi&s;tence of the pa&s;&s;ions of men, and he that does not feel it mu&s;t want a &s;ocial temper, and the true &s;pirit of patrioti&s;m. Nor, has the private character and deportment of Dr. Ru&s;h forfeited that e&s;teem which his public &s;ervices and fame &s;hould command. Where is the man who&s;e di&s;po&s;itions are more mild, who&s;e temper is le&s;s virulent, who&s;e affections, more warm and &s;incere.&mdash;From my &s;oul, I believe him to be among the mo&s;t unoffending and mo&s;t benevolent of mankind; &s;o that in the wide range of creation you cannot find too beings more unlike each other than Dr. Benjamin Ru&s;h and William Cobbett&mdash;Even when, day after day, this vile &s;ource of fal&s;hood and pollution, vomited forth the blacke&s;t venom of &s;lander upon his name, he &s;tood like a &s;uffering martyr, and dipped not his pen in the gall of controver&s;y.&mdash;And yet it is known that Dr. Ru&s;h can write&mdash;his pen has often been drawn in the &s;ervice of his country, never to blacken the name of his neighbour or wound the feelings of innocence. He did not even wipe away by contradiction the filth with which he was covered; determined that the hands of his country alone &s;hall either clean&s;e him from the&s;e foul a&s;per&s;ions, or &s;ink him deeper in di&s;grace.</P>
<P>When pe&s;tilence and death, walking hand in hand, &s;wept away the people of Athens with the be&s;om of de&s;truction, the immortal Hippo|crates threw him&s;elf undaunted into the mid&s;t of the danger, and endu|red the extremes of fatigue and di&s;tre&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t and deliver his peri&s;hing fellow citizens. How like this was the conduct of Dr. Ru&s;h in the memorable and dreadful year 1793. He then &s;tood foremo&s;t and al|mo&s;t alone to encounter and arre&s;t the ravages of death. Hundreds of our fellow citizens, &s;inking under the unparalleled calamities of po|verty and di&s;ea&s;e, &s;ought relief as well from the chri&s;tian charity and
<PB REF="037103_0013_100D3284EB0D2228">
benevolence of his heart as from the powerful application of his &s;kill. If there be any who &s;ought his attention in vain; if there be any who were repelled with unfeeling in&s;olence or mortifying neglect, let them declare it. For tho&s;e who received from him the relief they &s;ought, we a&s;k them not to &s;peak, it is not the applau&s;e of men or the tears of the grateful that he requires. The voice of con&s;cience &s;peaks a louder tone of applau&s;e, which the approbation of his God will render eternal&mdash;but, gentlemen, let us not forget the days of difficulty and di&s;tre&s;s, they have returned and may again return and utter dreadful reproach to the ungrateful. This flouri&s;hing city, where health, bu|&s;ine&s;s and plea&s;ure gave joy to every heart and ornamented every countenance, became at once &s;ilent as a wilderne&s;s, the &s;olemn the joyle&s;s habitation of di&s;ea&s;e and death; no longer the noi&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s was heard through our &s;treets, or the &s;prightly notes of mirth, but the dull &s;ounds of the heavy hear&s;e, and the lamentations of the wretched &s;truck an unea&s;y terror to the &s;oul "making night heidous." The day and the night were now the &s;ame. The ri&s;ing &s;un brought no comfort, no joy to the afflicted, nor night its u&s;ual re&s;t; all was &s;ad|ne&s;s ruin and de&s;pair; commerce bent her &s;ails for happier ports; your warehou&s;es no longer received or di&s;tributed the wealth of nations; the temples of God were clo&s;ed, and it was dangerous to meet together even to implore from divine mercy an i&s;&s;ue to our &s;ufferings&mdash;WHERE THEN WAS DR. RUSH? Where was this man, and HOW WAS HE EM|PLOYED, who has been treated as a very cut throat, or a worthle&s;s and abandoned vagabond, who di&s;graces the community which tolerates his exi&s;tence? Need I tell you where he was&mdash;God forbid that you &s;hould have forgotten&mdash;&s;eparated from a large and an amiable family, and expo&s;ed daily to a &s;eparation from them forever, he &s;eemed at once to have forgotten the hu&s;band, the father, and all tho&s;e tender ties and exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibilities which form the happine&s;s of &s;uch a man, and to have contemplated him&s;elf only as a citizen of Philadelphia. He &s;eems to have lo&s;t &s;ight of the duties he owes to his family, and to have been devoted to the more godlike duties he owes to his coun|try.</P>
<P>Twice he found him&s;elf langui&s;hing on the bed of &s;ickne&s;s, and ga&s;ping at the gates of death, di&s;tant from his family, and almo&s;t de|&s;erted by every friend&mdash;Scarcely had he recovered &s;trength to move, when he re&s;umed his dangerous duties; and often did he totter into the infected chambers of the &s;ick, when he could not a&s;cend to them with|out &s;topping to recover his exhau&s;ted &s;trength.&mdash;It was for the poor and helple&s;s too that he thus expo&s;ed him&s;elf to de&s;truction. The rich had generally fled&mdash;How like is this to the conduct of Hypocrates&mdash;I wi&s;h I could add how like Philadelphia to Athens. Athens heaped honors and wealth on her Phy&s;ician and his po&s;terity; but contumely and defamation have been the reward of ours. What are the rewards that Dr. Ru&s;h is ju&s;tly entitled to, ought not perhaps to be decided by his friends or enemies; but nearly all mu&s;t agree that he has not de&s;erved the treatment he has received from William Cobbett. It has been &s;trangely &s;ugge&s;ted by &s;ome (for this &s;uit has been a &s;ubject of pretty general conver&s;ation and concern) that Dr. Ru&s;h's character is
<PB REF="037103_0014_100D3288E4958E08">
too well known and e&s;tabli&s;hed to be injured by the attacks of Cob|bett, who is not worth his &s;erious attention, and therefore he &s;hould recover no damages in this action. I am &s;ure I think as highly of Dr. Ru&s;h, as any of tho&s;e who would in this manner palliate the con|duct of Cobbett, or weaken the claims of the plaintiff to redre&s;s. But, Gentlemen, there are few characters &s;o pure and &s;o impenetrable as to receive the con&s;tant, uncea&s;ing attack of malicious &s;lander, exerted in every po&s;&s;ible form and to every po&s;&s;ible point, without &s;tain or in|jury. Of a phy&s;ician this is mo&s;t emphatically nice. His reputation is a fabric delicate as air, the &s;lighte&s;t gu&s;t of popular prejudice or ca|price di&s;&s;ipates it, even &s;u&s;picion de&s;troys it; if he is di&s;tru&s;ted he is ruined. This notion that the purity of the object attacked is to ju&s;tify or le&s;&s;en the crime of the a&s;&s;ailant, is quite novel in morals and in law. Is the virtue of the injured, to be the defence of the injurer? Should it not rather be the protection of the ju&s;t? Have you a daughter of &s;potle&s;s virtue and di&s;cretion? Is it then no offence to proclaim her a pro&s;titute? are you unque&s;tionably upright and hone&s;t? Is it therefore no offence to publi&s;h you a &s;windler and a thief, while the real pro&s;ti|tute and the convicted thief would be entitled to exemplary damages?&mdash;Why, gentlemen, doctrines of this &s;ort are &s;o ab&s;urd, &s;o repugnant to every &s;entiment of ju&s;tice and propriety, that the hone&s;t heart &s;hrinks from them as from its bane? Let us &s;ee to what they would lead us. To &s;lander a man is &s;imply no offence; to villify a man pre-eminently wi&s;e and u&s;eful, is &s;omething better than merely an offence; and to bla&s;pheme the all pure and perfect God mu&s;t be highly meritorious. But to return to Dr. Ru&s;h's ability to with&s;tand the blows that have been aimed at him: It is not gentlemen this &s;ingle paragraph or that one that carries with it the deadly weight, and brings the intended victim to the ground. It is a regular concerted &s;y&s;tem of defamation, an uninterrupted and per&s;evering attack of calumny and &s;currility, in every form which they can a&s;&s;ume. Shmetimes it is made under &s;ome dark, my&s;terious paragraph, and &s;ometimes in the open language of denunciation. Now fear is alarmed with a bold a&s;&s;urance of danger, and now ridicule is exacted by the point of a je&s;t. Thus a net is thrown out for every weakne&s;s, pa&s;&s;ion or prejudice that is afloat in the community, and few e&s;cape the entanglement. This, gentlemen, is what &s;cribblers call, <HI>writing a man down,</HI> and is a mo&s;t abominable &s;pecies of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, although Dr. Ru&s;h's actual lo&s;s from the defendant's conduct mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been very important; yet it is not the only con&s;i|deration in the ca&s;e that calls for heavy damages. The utility of the&s;e actions is not merely to reimbur&s;e the pecuniary injury a man may have &s;u&s;tained; to <HI>pay</HI> for his character, which can have no price, but to correct vice, and give countenance to virtue; to confine the licentious within proper bounds; and give the worthy and good citizen a &s;afe and re&s;pectable &s;tation; to pre&s;erve the <HI>peace</HI> and <HI>purity</HI> of &s;ociety&mdash;The &s;econd que&s;tion then ari&s;es:&mdash;</P>
<P>From what motive or inducement has William Cobbett made his flagitious attack&mdash;was it a de&s;ire to inform the public mind?</P>
<P><PB REF="037103_0015_100D328B8078BE28">
The nature of the publications &s;hew this was not the ca&s;e. They do not con&s;i&s;t of any examination of the &s;y&s;tem and principles of Dr. Ru&s;h's practice, but merely of violent and low per&s;onal abu&s;e.</P>
<P>But, gentlemen, although the entire want of every thing like a ju&s;t cau&s;e of attack on Dr. Ru&s;h would ju&s;tify us and you in a&s;cribing a ba&s;e one to it, yet we &s;hall not rely even on this legal and rea&s;onable pre&s;umption. We &s;hall be able, by the light of living te&s;timony to trace the low malice of the defendant to its true &s;ource. We &s;hall trace it to per&s;onal hartred, grounded on political prejudice. You may remember, that &s;ome time pa&s;t, an eulogium was delivered, by the appoint|ment and direction of the Philo&s;ophical Society, on the late David Rittenhou&s;e; that this eulogium was delivered by Dr. Ru&s;h. Here, then originated the fir&s;t excitement of re&s;entment in the mind of Cob|bett again&s;t Dr. Ru&s;h. We &s;hall &s;hew you, as I am in&s;tructed, that, from that moment he determined on the attack. Long he waited for an opportunity to gratify this groveling re&s;entment, and di&s;charge the venom that rankled in his heart.</P>
<P>From the te&s;timony of a re&s;pectable witne&s;s we &s;hall al&s;o &s;hew you that the defendant did not him&s;elf pretend that his attack on Dr. Ru&s;h was commenced with a view to give u&s;eful information to the public on an intere&s;ting que&s;tion, to correct any errors in Dr. Ru&s;h's &s;y&s;tem or treatment of his patients, or di&s;pen&s;e any public benefit whatever; but that he avowed to be <HI>personal against the Dr.</HI> and <HI>not against his system,</HI> that he avowed his ignorance whether the &s;y&s;tem was right or wrong, and declared he &s;hould have &s;aid nothing about it, had any other man than Dr. Ru&s;h brought it forward. Where, then, can be the defence, were the ju&s;ti|fication, where the apology for the infamous &s;landers he has heaped upon a worthy and honor able citizen? Does he not &s;tand the mo&s;t barbarous, the mo&s;t wanton, the mo&s;t impudent defamer that has ever exi&s;ted?</P>
<P>Slander is a headlong torrent that ru&s;hes over the land&mdash;like a migh|ty water rolling from the mountain's top, it &s;preads and &s;trengthens as it goes&mdash;the palace and the cottage are involved in its common ruin&mdash;nothing is &s;o high that it cannot reach it, or &s;o mean that it will not de&s;cend to it&mdash;let not the great promi&s;e them&s;elves &s;ecurity in the unblemi&s;hed dignity of their characters, nor the humble expect &s;afety in their ob&s;curity&mdash;like death it comes to every man's door. What is there &s;o pure, or what &s;o &s;acred that it has e&s;caped this cormorant of defamation. From the highe&s;t magi&s;trate to the meane&s;t vagabond no|thing has been &s;ecure; all men and all nations have been called with an equal tone of authority to the bar of his reproach, and every law, liberty and in&s;titution has undergone his <HI>modest</HI> animadver&s;ions. He has a&s;&s;umed a haughty and tyranical juri&s;diction over every thing pub|lic or private; political or dome&s;tic; religious or moral, not only with|in the United States, but in every quarter of the globe. His arrogant vanity is as di&s;gu&s;ting as his crimes are dete&s;table. William Cobbett is indeed a phenomenon even in the courts of defamation.</P>
<P>He may look back on the endle&s;s li&s;t of his predece&s;&s;ors in the of|fices of &s;candal who have, at different times, infe&s;ted &s;ociety, and, al|though, he will find many &s;uperior in <HI>talents, learning</HI> and <HI>wit,</HI> he will di&s;cover few equal in <HI>boldness</HI> and <HI>scurrility.</HI> His opinion is the <HI>great law</HI> from whence there mu&s;t be no appeal; his a&s;&s;ertion, the <HI>high au|thority</HI>
<PB REF="037103_0016_100D328D497059F0">
from whence there mu&s;t be no enquiry. De&s;potic dogma u&s;urps the place of ju&s;t knowledge, and the mo&s;t loath&s;ome vulgarity is offered as a &s;ub&s;titute for wit. The eye of decency can &s;eldom read his pages without offence, and virtue turns from them with in|dignation and di&s;gu&s;t. Is there a &s;pecies of editorial pollution that has not blackened them? If there be, it is becau&s;e it has e&s;caped the laborious indu&s;try, and acutene&s;s of this <HI>strange man.</HI></P>
<P>There is, gentlemen, no &s;ubject of political enquiry that has excit|ed more anxiety among the people of every free country; there are few &s;ubjects that have employed more able pens, or received more fre|quent di&s;cu&s;&s;ions in every po&s;&s;ible form of argument than the <HI>Liberty of the Press</HI>&mdash;and yet perhaps, there is no &s;ubject now more remote from <HI>a general understanding</HI> or &s;ettled opinion. It is &s;o difficult to draw the ju&s;t and &s;afe line between the proper u&s;e and the in&s;ufferable abu&s;e of this liberty; &s;o difficult to fix its legal or its rea&s;onable bound; to &s;ay "thus far &s;halt thou go and no farther;" to &s;ay, here flow the whole&s;ome waters of Liberty, and there begins the poi&s;oned torrent of Licentiou&s;ne&s;s; that all that has been &s;aid, and I fear all that will ever be &s;aid, on the &s;ubject, has but little effect to produce an unity of &s;entiment, or e&s;tabli&s;h the point &s;ought after. Another rea|&s;on may be offered for the univer&s;al uncertainty and di&s;agreement on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The di&s;cu&s;&s;ion is conducted, the inferences are drawn, and the judg|ment is formed more by the pa&s;&s;ions and particular intere&s;ts, than by the ju&s;t rea&s;on of the &s;everal advocates and enquirers. While this &s;hall continue to be the ca&s;e, and while the pa&s;&s;ions and intere&s;ts of men &s;hall continue to drive them to different wi&s;hes and different objects, no coalition can be hoped for on this &s;ubject. But, gentlemen, this mighty uproar about the liberty of the pre&s;s, and all the <HI>violence,</HI> de|clamation and invective that it has excited, touch not the ca&s;e of <HI>private slander.</HI> By a common principle of &s;elf pre&s;ervation, by a common principle of unque&s;tionable ju&s;tice, by a common appreciation of the value of character, and by the dictates of hone&s;ty and &s;ound po|licy, all men have agreed that this admits of no defence. No writer, no declaimer, however mad with popular enthu&s;ia&s;m, has yet been wild and ab&s;urd enough to claim or defend a right of wanton abu&s;e of his neighbors character. The di&s;pute has been how far, and in what manner, public men in their public capacities, and public mea&s;ures in their public tendency, are to be inve&s;tigated and reproached at the bar of the public, through the medium of the pre&s;s. But no di&s;pute has ever been had upon the &s;anctity of private reputation and happine&s;s.&mdash;No que&s;tion has aro&s;e, whether a vindictive enemy may, with wanton fal&s;ehood and ungovernable rage, attack, through the pre&s;s, the cha|racter of the object of his hate; may di&s;tort truth and invent fal&s;hood, may &s;et every engine of malice, ingenuity and ridicule to work to render him contemptible and dete&s;ted; to &s;catter mi&s;ery through an unoffending and amiable family, and bring them down from a fair &s;tation in &s;ociety to contumely, wretchedne&s;s and want. Yet &s;uch have been the views and wi&s;hes of William Cobbett in this ca&s;e, and
<PB REF="037103_0017_100D328FE1B7E988">
to accompli&s;h them none of his va&s;t re&s;ources in this way have been unemployed.</P>
<P>I profe&s;s my&s;elf, gentlemen, a zealous and devoted friend to the <HI>true liberty of the Press.</HI> I view it as a lofty citadel from whence the people overlook the conduct of their governors; encourage, ap|prove and reward the virtuous, and cru&s;h the daring effects of ambi|tious oppre&s;&s;ion or unprincipled de&s;igns. The wicked &s;tand appalled before it, and the good flouri&s;h and rejoice. But, permit me to &s;ay that the &s;afety of this citadel in this country at lea&s;t, is more endan|gered by the treachery, malignity and arrogance of pretended friends, than from the violence of open foes. Such friends, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves of this important &s;tation, and protected under its &s;acred walls, u&s;e this high privilege for the mo&s;t abandoned purpo&s;es. That which was intended for the public good, is the pro&s;tituted in&s;trument of private malice&mdash;that which was erected for the &s;alvation of a people, becomes the foul avenger of a villain's wrath. That thunder which &s;tood ready to a&s;&s;ert violated rights, and protect the liberties of millions, is pointed with deadly vengeance again&s;t the dome&s;tic happine&s;s of &s;ome virtuous fa|mily, the private peace of &s;ome de&s;erving citizens. Nay, again&s;t the very inclo&s;ures of &s;ocial order and harmony and the ramparts of reli|gion and morality? Is this the Liberty of the Pre&s;s? Are the&s;e the ends for which it was in&s;tituted and pre&s;erved? You mu&s;t not, gentle|men, be made to believe that the Liberty of the Pre&s;s is attacked or endangered, whenever a &s;currilous printer is pro&s;ecuted and brought to ju&s;tice for &s;ome malicious and profligate attack upon an unoffending neighbor. The&s;e are truly the only means of pre&s;erving it pure, va|luable and undefiled. By the&s;e means only will it continue to be a ble&s;&s;ing&mdash;to be a terror to evil doers, and a prai&s;e and protection to tho&s;e that do well. Let not the fair fabric be defiled; and by becom|ing the ba&s;e engine of malignant per&s;ecution, become the ju&s;t object of univer&s;al dete&s;tation. Pre&s;erve it in its exqui&s;ite beauty; its elegant proportions, and its impenetrable &s;trength; and let not its foundations be &s;apped by treacherous guardians, till its high walls totter and fall. The&s;e high toned and pretended &s;ons of Liberty, who bawl ince&s;&s;ant|ly about the Rights of the Pre&s;s, while they blacken it with their de|te&s;table crimes; who tell you it is &s;acred, while they are plunging it in di&s;grace; who under its name and &s;anction practice the mo&s;t aban|doned licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and invade our mo&s;t important and valuable rights, mu&s;t be laid low, or they will work a fatal ruin to the liberty they abu&s;e; pretending to be its friends, they are its mo&s;t deadly foes; pre|tending to protect, they inevitably de&s;troy it. To pre&s;erve the Liberty of the Pre&s;s from ruin and contempt it is nece&s;&s;ary to bring down the&s;e wretched impo&s;tors. While frequent pro&s;ecutions again&s;t the Pre&s;s, are &s;ome times the refuge of tyranny &s;hrinking from inve&s;tigation, it mu&s;t be remembered, they may al&s;o be the &s;ymptoms of approaching extreme depravity and licentiou&s;ne&s;s among a people. When the latter is the ca&s;e, the evil is to be corrected by expo&s;ing every atrocious offender, to &s;evere and exemplary puni&s;hment, and not by &s;hielding him under the Liberty of the Pre&s;s. To make defamation dangerous and dete&s;table, is the only mode of pre&s;erving the pre&s;s from dete&s;tati|on.
<PB REF="037103_0018_100D32941514ED48">
Let this liberty and defamation never be cla&s;&s;ed together! Ask me, what are the evidences of the decay of religion and morals among a people, of the approaching di&s;regard of every &s;ocial law and duty, of the entire pro&s;tration of truth, honor and hone&s;ty, of the tottering &s;tate of government, of the bur&s;ting of the &s;ocial compact and of the con&s;equent &s;cenes of blood-&s;hed, revolutions and warring chaos, and I will tell you, it is a boundle&s;s multiplication of licentious libels, a pub|lic encouragement of malicious defamation, and unpuni&s;hed ravage upon reputation.</P>
<P>When good character lo&s;es its value and protection in &s;ociety, when it is fallen into ridicule and contempt, why &s;hould any man labor to obtain it? It is <HI>excess</HI> that is the great de&s;troyer of all things: human exce&s;s of health &s;ometimes &s;hatters the human frame, and bur&s;ts the &s;trong ligaments of life. Exce&s;s of de&s;poti&s;m has humbled the mo&s;t powerful monarchs; and exce&s;s of liberty has &s;ubverted the firme&s;t re|publics. Seldom has a tyranny been overthrown by the mere &s;pirit of liberty among the people, unle&s;s fir&s;t rou&s;ed, a&s;&s;i&s;ted and goaded to ac|tion by the in&s;olent and in&s;ufferable oppre&s;&s;ion of overgrown power, and never has the freedom of a republic been de&s;troyed by the bare &s;trength of the arm of the u&s;urper, unle&s;s favored by tho&s;e di&s;orders, di&s;tractions and con&s;equent weakne&s;s and di&s;union, which the corrup|tion and licentiou&s;ne&s;s of liberty never fail to produce. Permit me, gentlemen, to make a few more ob&s;ervations on this liberty of the pre&s;s. Is not this at once ab&s;urd and in&s;ulting to an intolerable de|gree? a printer will &s;pend months and years in unprovoked, uncea&s;ing exertions to de&s;troy the character and fortune of a fellow-citizen, to bring him into public hatred and contempt, to overturn every fair pro&s;pect in life, and reduce him and his family to poverty and di&s;|grace; but <HI>this</HI> is not <HI>persecution;</HI> it is <HI>liberty, the sacred liberty of the press.</HI> If the oppre&s;&s;ed individual &s;eeks redre&s;s for his in&s;ufferable in|juries, and endeavors to avert the threatening ruin; if he calls upon his &s;landerer in the mo&s;t decent and dignified manner to &s;upport his charges; if con&s;cious of innocence, and martyrs under injuries, he de|termines even to put his character in i&s;&s;ue again&s;t his vile and lurking defamer; this indeed is <HI>persecution,</HI> the whole country is alarmed and inflamed; the liberty of the pre&s;s is attacked; the great palladium of our rights, the &s;acred and unalienable pledge of freedom is threat|ened with immediate de&s;truction; and the poor innocent, unoffending printer, loudly demands univer&s;al &s;ympathy, and public protection from <HI>persecution.</HI> Can we li&s;ten a moment to &s;uch impudent ab&s;urdity and non&s;en&s;e, to &s;uch a horrid perver&s;ion of the eternal dictates of truth and ju&s;tice? If Dr. Ru&s;h is guilty of per&s;ecution in applying to the tribunal of his country for the ju&s;tification of his character, and the redre&s;s of his wrongs; if he is guilty of per&s;ecution when he calls his a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in to open, fair and dignified ground, to the courts of ju&s;tice of his country, making the great i&s;&s;ue between them TRUTH, and con|&s;enting to &s;tand or fall, to be ju&s;tified or di&s;graced by this infallible ar|biter; when he puts this i&s;&s;ue on trial before a jury of his fellow-ci|tizens, ju&s;t and impartial&mdash;I &s;ay, if this is <HI>persecution,</HI> what term, what language is vile, is ba&s;e, is indignant enough to expre&s;s a ju&s;t &s;entiment
<PB REF="037103_0019_100D3296B11D5D40">
of the conduct of a printer who attacks his neighbor with deadly weapons, condemns and de&s;troys him, unheard, undefended; who, without remor&s;e, will plant thorns in the hearts of unoffending chil|dren, and a tender wife, and tear down, with ruthle&s;s hands, the peace and pro&s;pects of an exten&s;ive, re&s;pectable and amiable family.</P>
<P>It is equally a&s;toni&s;hing and ab&s;urd in this man, &s;o loudly and &s;o frequently to a&s;&s;ert, that the American pre&s;s is the mo&s;t tame, humble and abject in the world, while his own daily publications, and tho&s;e of his competitor, the AURORA, give &s;o flat a contradiction to the a&s;&s;er|tion; while, from tho&s;e pre&s;&s;es there ince&s;&s;antly i&s;&s;ues a pe&s;tilential deadly vapor of the mo&s;t low and vile defamation; and the&s;e things are not only winked at by the law, but too much applauded by the peo|ple.&mdash;But the pre&s;s of Great Britain, he &s;ays, is more free and un|&s;hackled. If it be &s;o, &s;o much the greater the cur&s;e. But the fact is not &s;o. Their re&s;traints on this mo&s;t abominable &s;pecies of licentiou&s;|ne&s;s are whole&s;ome and &s;evere. I &s;ay, it is fal&s;e, that the ju&s;t and de|&s;irable liberty of the pre&s;s is more cheri&s;hed or protected in England, or any where el&s;e, than here. I &s;ay this to defend the con&s;titution and laws of my country from the groundle&s;s a&s;&s;ertion. We know what the con&s;titutional liberty of the pre&s;s is here, and do not our books inform us what it is in England? Is not page after page and volume after volume loaded with private actions and public pro&s;ecutions for libels and &s;landers? Do not we &s;ee the mo&s;t exemplary puni&s;hments inflicted for them, and very properly too: and are not the rights of reputation a &s;pecial object of protection with Engli&s;h law. Is not defamation re&s;i&s;ted and depre&s;&s;ed, as a mo&s;t dangerous foe to the order and ex|i&s;tence of &s;ociety, tending to the introduction of the mo&s;t enormous crimes, the fatal exce&s;&s;es of revenge. Indeed, does not Mr. Cobbett him&s;elf applaud the &s;everity and vigilance of the Engli&s;h courts of ju|ri&s;prudence in puni&s;hing the publi&s;her of Paine's infamous libel on religion and morality; and in the &s;ame book boa&s;t of the licentious la|titude which printers enjoy in England&mdash;Do we not know that men have there expiated on the pillory, expo&s;ed to the ferocity and in&s;ult of a mob, the offence of libelling; and mo&s;t ju&s;tly and de&s;ervedly too: Have we not &s;een a member of the Hou&s;e of Commons, driven from his &s;eat and not only &s;o, but declared ever after ineligible for the of|fence of libelling. And I rejoice that he was &s;o. To di&s;countenance and puni&s;h even to exce&s;s, indecent ob&s;cene and defamatory publicati|ons is the be&s;t proof of the virtue and purity of a people, and of the energy and &s;tability of their government.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not, Gentlemen, detain you much longer! I feel that I have already tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed too much on your patience. But &s;uffer me to turn your attention for a moment to the &s;ituation of the plaintiff in this cau&s;e. He has a tender and affectionate wife, who fully participates in all his misfortunes, injuries, and mortifications. The blow that pierces his character and happine&s;s, opens a deep wound in her heart, tearing with remor&s;ele&s;s rage all the fine fibres and delicate &s;ympathies of conjugal love. Have the&s;e no value, that they &s;hall be the wanton &s;port of ba&s;e malignity? He has an amiable and valuable young fa|mily

ju&s;t ri&s;ing into that age of nice feeling and generous &s;en&s;ibility, when the reputation of a parent, they have ever deemed immaculate (if this be weakne&s;s, where is the virtuous child that is not weak?) is peculiarly dear and intere&s;ting! and when every attempt to blacken or degrade it, corrodes their feelings with poi&s;onous rancor, &s;hocks with new horror, and excites a boundle&s;s indignation. Are the&s;e things of no importance, that they &s;hall be done with impunity? What a &s;cene for a hu&s;band and a father? By what crimes has he merited the&s;e things?

<P><HI>To conclude</HI>&mdash;Volumes need not be unfolded to inform you, Gentle|men, what &s;lander is.

An immediate, nay, a ju&s;tifiable re&s;ort to private vengeance for pri|vate wrongs; an immediate and a nece&s;&s;ary introduction of murder and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination.

<P>The alternative is obvious and inevitable. To my&s;elf and my own exertions I mu&s;t apply for that ju&s;tice which my country idly promi&s;es and &s;hamefully denies.

<HEAD>DR. COX, was &s;worn.</HEAD>
<P>He depo&s;ed that on the 2d of October, 1797, a gentleman who had ju&s;t arrived from the We&s;t Indies called upon him, and after &s;ome con|ver&s;ation told him he was &s;oon going to &s;ail for England; but wi&s;hed before he went, to &s;ee Peter Porcupine, (the defendant) who had ren|dered him&s;elf &s;o celebrated. He a&s;ked the witne&s;s to inform him where he lived; upon which he, (the witne&s;s) accompanied him to his hou&s;e, having occa&s;ionally been in the habit of &s;tepping into his &s;hop.&mdash;After &s;ome general conver&s;ation had pa&s;&s;ed, the witne&s;s expre&s;&s;ed to the de|fendant his di&s;approbation of his publications re&s;pecting the u&s;e of the lancet, and re&s;pecting Dr. Ru&s;h in particular, as this remedy had been recommended by him in certain ca&s;es.&mdash;He replied to my ob&s;ervation, &s;aid the witne&s;s, that his writing could be of very little con&s;equence, or have no effect upon the public mind; I replied that I thought it was impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould imagine what he &s;aid, for he mu&s;t know that all he wrote mu&s;t have a very con&s;iderable effect, particularly at the time the mind of the public was &s;o di&s;tracted. He returned the &s;ame reply adding that as he was not a phy&s;ician, people would naturally &s;uppo&s;e that he knew nothing of the &s;ubject. I ob&s;erved to him then, that the effect was certainly produced; he replied that he did not be|lieve he &s;hould ever have &s;aid &s;o much on bleeding or mercurials, if Dr. Ru&s;h had not been the author of it.</P>
<P>An article entitled THE POTENT QUACK, was then read in evidence of the de&s;ign, and per&s;i&s;tence of the defendant, from <HI>Porcu|pines Gazette,</HI> of October 5, 1797, which he introduces in the&s;e words:</P>
<P>[<HI>The following are Mr. Fenno, junior's remarks on Dr. Rush's let|ter to Brown, announcing that he had entered actions against Fenno and me.</HI>]</P>
<P>Here follows the letter from Fenno's paper.</P>
<P>After which the defendant introduces his remarks in the&s;e words:</P>
<P>[<HI>I defy the Grand Empiric, aided by all his legion of subaltern quacks, to compose a paragraph like this that closes young Fenno's remarks.</HI>&mdash;<HI>These are cutting truths for the Doctor.</HI>&mdash;<HI>They leave the mark.</HI>]</P>
<P>The words referred to in the latter part of Fenno's remarks are as follow:</P>
<P>"The fact is, and I have before glanced at it, that a loved &s;cheme of the Doctor's ambition met a rough blow in 1793, and in 1797 a re|petition, which threatens in progre&s;s to ca&s;t the &s;cheme and its author into the &s;hades of ob&s;curity. This has been effected through the

medium of the pre&s;s, and the pre&s;s, therefore, is the fir&s;t object whereon his vengeance is to be wreaked.&mdash;Con&s;cious as I am, of the pure&s;t motives, and mo&s;t upright intentions, I &s;hall wait with entire compo&s;ure the i&s;&s;ue of a trial, which I have no doubt will complete the downfall of quackery and empirici&s;m: and will at lea&s;t be valuable in one point of view, as it will &s;erve to &s;hew on what ground &s;tands the liberty of the pre&s;s, whether it is in America an empty name, or a valuable reality&mdash;whether that to which the country owes every po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which it can boa&s;t, aye! even its liberty and independence, &s;hall be trampled under foot by groundle&s;s pro&s;ecutions; and all tho&s;e barriers erected by the &s;pirit of freedom, as entrenchments round poverty and ob&s;curity, again&s;t the pride of wealth and the in&s;olence of power, are to be rudely thru&s;t down, and a liberticide medical tribunal e&s;tabli&s;hed on the ruins of rea&s;on and the wrecks of common &s;en&s;e."</P>
<P>A letter in&s;erted in Porcupine's Gazette of October 6, 1797, was al&s;o read in evidence which related a cure of the Yellow Fever by a &s;oldier's accidental immer&s;ion in Tar. The editor, William Cobbett, makes the following inferrence:</P>
<P>[<HI>This seems an odd kind of a remedy; but I would rather Tar with the addition of Feathers, than venture my life against the lancet of Dr. Rush.</HI></P>

<HEAD>MR. RAWLE Addre&s;&s;ed the Jury to the following effect:</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>With submission to your Honors,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I &s;tand up, Gentlemen of the Jury, much more impre&s;&s;ed with diffi|culty on account of the extraordinary and unu&s;ual manner with which the gentleman who preceded me has thought proper to open his cau&s;e, than of any danger in which my client &s;tands from the accu&s;ations on which this pro&s;ecution is grounded.</P>
<P>It has not fallen to my lot, &s;ince I have had the honour of appear|ing in the character of an advocate, or &s;ince I began my endeavors to obtain a knowledge of the law, to hear &s;uch &s;erious animadver&s;ions made, or &s;uch &s;trong &s;tigma u&s;ed on the character of any man, as that gentleman has u&s;ed in reference to my client, the defendant. I could not help being &s;truck with the compari&s;on of that addre&s;s and the publications which it was meant to implicate.&mdash;In that compari&s;on I declare I can perceive none which deals in &s;o &s;trong epithets&mdash;none bordering &s;o much on abu&s;e, as tho&s;e are with which the gentleman
<PB REF="037103_0025_100D32A61F02E760">
has amu&s;ed you. If it were po&s;&s;ible to commit this opening addre&s;s to paper, there would be no difficulty in di&s;criminating which was mo&s;t de&s;erving the appellation of <HI>slander.</HI>&mdash;Gentlemen, if you believe the declarations of my opponent, you mu&s;t be brought to believe William Cobbett to be the mo&s;t <HI>insignificant</HI> and <HI>worthless reptile in creation,</HI> and that under the &s;hape of a man, he has &s;talked abroad <HI>a very monster</HI>&mdash;that for him, no ju&s;tice ought to be had&mdash;that he is to be expunged from all ranks of &s;ociety, that he is to remain an eter|nal mark for hatred, and courts of Ju&s;tice are never to con&s;ider him as even the object of mercy!&mdash;Mercy, that which we all claim, that which we think we are all entitled to, &s;eems not to be his due! Gentlemen, even your opinions and your pa&s;&s;ions too have been a&s;&s;aulted, and called forth in a manner, which to me, has hitherto been perfectly unknown. This human mon&s;ter&mdash;this mo&s;t unheard of being&mdash;every thing that is entitled to the terms of <HI>vile</HI> and <HI>base,</HI> has been repre&s;ented as the de&s;troyer of the public peace and happine&s;s; as the di&s;turber of the harmony of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>But permit me to &s;ay, that this is not the way to appeal to the ju&s;tice of a Jury. Ju&s;tice is what even <HI>this man</HI> has a right to de|mand of you, ba&s;e as he has been made to appear. You have a right to &s;tand indifferent to the common received, or repre&s;ented &s;tate of any man's character, who &s;hall be brought before you. You are to po&s;&s;e&s;s no prejudices no opinions&mdash;no prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. I tru&s;t ju&s;tice will be your only impre&s;&s;ion in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. But although every effort has been u&s;ed to endeavor to excite your prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t the defendant, every other &s;en&s;ation that that of &s;trict equity, ought to be left at the door, the moment you enter this court.</P>
<P>On the contrary, you have heard the Gentleman amu&s;ing him&s;elf, and no doubt, agreeably entertaining his audience with repre&s;enting the <HI>highly superior</HI> character of the Plaintiff;&mdash;he is &s;uperior to men in general&mdash;nay any man&mdash;he is an angel from God, clothed with every virtue&mdash;with every qualification, while Mr. Cobbett is nothing but a daemon from the infernal regions. With you it is not left to judge of the di&s;tinction, but to you they &s;tand on equal grounds.</P>
<P>Dr. Ru&s;h &s;tands before you as a re&s;pectable citizen, who has done much to increa&s;e the good of &s;ociety; but permit me &s;ay, <HI>society have rewarded him for it.</HI> This is his happine&s;s, and I am not inclined to &s;ay it is not his de&s;ert. While we are entertained with &s;uch a &s;trik|ing and affecting picture of the calamity which has di&s;tre&s;&s;ed our city, and the general di&s;tre&s;s experienced thereon, we are told that this good angel went from door to door, communicating his a&s;&s;i&s;tance freely, but no doubt, every man who &s;o expo&s;ed him&s;elf, whatever general good he might admini&s;ter, received an adequate compen&s;ation. If he has bravely faced death, he has met the lot of his profe&s;&s;ion. The com|mon &s;ailor, who has &s;hipped him&s;elf on board a ve&s;&s;el of war, might, in the hands of my eloquent opponent, be repre&s;ented as a man who has faced the cannon ball, inured him&s;elf to the dangers and hard|&s;hips of the boi&s;terous ocean, and met danger at every avenue of his calling; but what would his oratory amount to more, than that others did &s;o, and it was their profe&s;&s;ion. Dr. Ru&s;h ought to have every
<PB REF="037103_0026_100D32A9CE028088">
merit which he de&s;erves: but let it not be forgotten that William Cobbett ought to have every merit <HI>he</HI> de&s;erves, and every privilege to which he is entitled&mdash;let him have every cen&s;ure he de&s;erves, and yet, I repeat, both &s;tand upon equal ground before you. Cobbett puts him|&s;elf upon the i&s;&s;ue, and you are to decide according to evidence, and thus only.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, to the declaration filed, we have pleaded not guilty. We are charged with having <HI>maliciously</HI> written &s;uch and &s;uch things, in order to de&s;troy the good name that Dr. Ru&s;h has heretofore borne a|mong his fellow-citizens. We deny the malicious part of the accu&s;a|tion, and to obtain our right, we put our&s;elves upon a jury of our country, and unle&s;s it can be proved that the publications laid to our charge are of the nature de&s;ignated, to wit, malicious, we are entitled to your acquittal in the action.</P>
<P>The malice of a libel is collected, in general, either from its nece&s;&s;a|ry con&s;truction, plainly apparent on the face of a publication, or from &s;ome circum&s;tances ea&s;ily deducible from the nature of the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>We have heard, upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, the te&s;timony of &s;ome medical gentlemen brought forward, alleging, that at periods &s;ub&s;e|quent to this pro&s;ecution being entered, the defendant u&s;ed words, tending to &s;how that the&s;e publications proceeded from per&s;onal ma|lice. To me, the whole of the publications and charges appear to be free from per&s;onal, private or dome&s;tic malice. How could they i&s;&s;ue from per&s;onal malevolence? I a&s;k whether it has been proved, in any ca&s;e, that Cobbett has endeavored to intermeddle with the family con|cerns of Dr. Ru&s;h? or whether, on the other hand, the whole of the publications have not been &s;o far ju&s;tifiable, in as much as they treat|ed only on a &s;ubject of public enquiry? Mo&s;t true it is that every man has a property in his own reputation&mdash;mo&s;t true it is that the law has &s;pread about the reputation of every man all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance po&s;&s;ible; but there is another thing <HI>demands</HI> your con&s;ideration: he who exi&s;ts in community, hath a property and intere&s;t equally valuable in the hap|pine&s;s, &s;afety and peace of that community. To every man, the&s;e are important con&s;iderations: every man is bound by them, and his own welfare is in them&mdash;every man is puni&s;hable for a neglect of them. It is of con&s;equence to a man, that in the &s;ociety he has &s;elected for his re&s;idence, he &s;hould &s;ee pro&s;perity about him, otherwi&s;e he can have but little hope of pro&s;ecuting his own means for his own benefit. In order to procure this object, he will exhort all the citizens of the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem, who enjoy a common cau&s;e with him, to adopt what is good, and leave what is evil. Where &s;uch have been the efforts of a man, he is undoubtedly entitled to re&s;pect. This principle is con&s;i&s;tent with the con&s;titution of Penn&s;ylvania, Sect. 3. Art. 9. And there exi&s;ts no law of the &s;tate or general governments that re&s;trains a full and free in|ve&s;tigation of the merits of any que&s;tion in which the public are inter|e&s;ted. If in the cour&s;e of this inve&s;tigation expre&s;&s;ions are u&s;ed, and ob&s;ervations made which may fall heavy on the concerns of the per|&s;on about whom he is writing, it is &s;ufficient for the per&s;on accu&s;ed, if he can &s;how that he has not been guilty of untruths, nor entered
<PB REF="037103_0027_100D32AC2197DE68">
into the family or moral connections of his accu&s;er; but that he has only thrown his mite into the public &s;tock of information.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, there are few offices in &s;ociety of more public import|ance than that of a phy&s;ician, few on whom &s;o much depends the hap|pine&s;s of the community. A good, &s;kilful, laborious, hone&s;t phy&s;ician, is a very valuable member of &s;ociety. But, on the contrary, an un|&s;kilful, avaricious, indolent phy&s;ician de&s;erves, not only public di&s;ap|probation, but, public contempt. Private compen&s;ation, and public confidence is the &s;ure reward of the meritorious practitioner; but you have heard this man's character even exalted above humanity; &s;uperi|or to humanity indeed mu&s;t he be, if in the whole of his <HI>exten&s;ive practice</HI> he never committed &s;ome error; if he never for a moment a|dopted &s;ome mi&s;taken principle, and perhaps tenaciou&s;ly, not to &s;ay ob&s;tinately adhered to it! Such in&s;tances in every profe&s;&s;ion, in men the mo&s;t celebrated we have known, and I pre&s;ume &s;hall continue to know. If on the <HI>public</HI> labors of any man in &s;ociety, animadver&s;ion is admi&s;&s;ible, on which can it be &s;o properly exerci&s;ed as on the man in who&s;e hands, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, is life and death? Who &s;o fit an object on whom to exerci&s;e the liberty of the pre&s;s? I &s;incerely tru&s;t we ne|ver &s;hall &s;ee the day when any public character, how e&s;pecial &s;oever the qualifications of his head or heart, or how bad &s;oever, as to ex|clude him from enjoying the common advantages of his good charac|ter, or &s;ecure him from ju&s;t odium for his reprehen&s;ible conduct, and I tru&s;t we never &s;hall &s;ee the time when any man, however ba&s;e his character may be, &s;hould be denied that ju&s;tice which our con&s;titution and laws make the common right of all men.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the Fever of 1793, it is well remembered, was truly &s;erious and awful, a di&s;ea&s;e then almo&s;t unknown among us, &s;o that the mo&s;t wi&s;e was at a lo&s;s how to act. Different modes of treatment, and different experiments were made, but notwith&s;tanding great numbers de&s;erted the city, and notwith&s;tanding the utmo&s;t exertions and inge|nuity of the Phy&s;icians, about one fourth of the people who remained died. Of the number who remained Dr. Ru&s;h was one. I need only appeal to your recollections how unlimited were the publications which &s;ucceeded that fever, &s;o unaccountable and various were the attacks, and &s;o difficult and various the modes of treatment, that it was con&s;i|dered a ju&s;tifiable &s;ubject of public di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. To &s;ome of the&s;e pub|lications I might appeal, and &s;hew you how &s;trong, how acrimonious was the language, u&s;ed even between the members of that learned pro|fe&s;&s;ion. The &s;ubject continued thus, for a long time a &s;ubject of pub|lic controver&s;y, and much warmth was u&s;ed. Finally, by the inter|po&s;ition of divine Providence, more than the united attempts of men, the di&s;order di&s;appeared, and for four years we happily remained free from its dreadful ravages, conceiving our&s;elves quite &s;ecure from its return. However it again made its appearance in 1797. What was a &s;ubject of &s;o much public di&s;cu&s;&s;ion in 1793, was re&s;umed in the &s;ub&s;equent attack, at that time others, be&s;ides the unfortunate defend|ant, who, it appears to me, is &s;ufficiently paid for his temerity by the accu&s;ations brought again&s;t him, others took the liberty to declare, as all mankind ought to encourage them to do, what their opinions were
<PB REF="037103_0028_100D32ADB4515750">
of the topic. At this period we find i&s;&s;ue from the pre&s;s of Mr. Cobbett what it has been thought proper to ground this pro&s;ecution on&mdash;not for a&s;&s;ailing the private character of Dr. Ru&s;h; not tearing open his connections, nor meddling with his family concerns, but for di&s;cu&s;s|ing a public que&s;tion, in &s;uch a manner as others had thought proper to do before him, and were then doing. The topics of public di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion were the free u&s;e of the lancet, and mercurial purges. And who &s;o natural, &s;o likely to be attacked as the per&s;on who was well known to be at the head of this &s;y&s;tem of treatment, a &s;y&s;tem peculiarly adopt|ed and recommended by Dr. Ru&s;h, and followed by his pupils. Hence the name of Dr. Ru&s;h, and the u&s;e of bleeding and Mercury in the Yellow Fever came into public notice at one period. We know that the two learned bodies in this city, who were incorporated for the purpo&s;e of e&s;tabli&s;hing public confidence, by an unanimity of &s;y&s;tem, (I refer to the academy of medicine and the college of Phy&s;icians)&mdash;Tho&s;e two bodies e&s;tabli&s;hed different &s;y&s;tems in the treatment of this di&s;ea&s;e. This certainly gave to Mr. Cobbett, allowing that he is a man entitled to the u&s;e of his faculty of rea&s;on, and the common pri|vilege enjoyed in the United States, this &s;urely gives to him the pri|vilege of expre&s;&s;ing his opinion, as applicable, not barely to the prin|ciple, but to the practice u&s;ed: and what might encourage him the more, he thought that whatever he might advance, as appeared in the evidence, could do no injury, not being a medical man him&s;elf, and if he was wrong he &s;hould only expo&s;e his ignorance, which he was willing to hazard, hoping however that he might eventually do good.</P>
<P>Doctor Ru&s;h was at that time a very public character, and exerci&s;ing an important public function: Mr. Cobbett was unque&s;tionably exer|ci&s;ing his con&s;titutional right to do at that time, what others did, to examine his public tran&s;actions, in which he thought he was on the &s;ide of humanity.&mdash;Suppo&s;e we &s;ee an individual, or a number of per|&s;ons running headlong towards a precipice, down which they mu&s;t ine|vitably fall, &s;hall I be blamed if I &s;ay to them &s;top, li&s;ten not to the man who advi&s;ed you to take that road: I will give you &s;olid advice, go the other way. They e&s;cape the danger, and I have done my duty. Gentlemen, however the conduct of Mr. Cobbett may appear in the &s;ub&s;equent part, it is plain that the &s;y&s;tem e&s;tabli&s;hed by Dr. Ru&s;h, has not produced all the good effects he wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>[Mr. Rawle here read a letter written in Augu&s;t 1798 from Drs. Phy&s;ic and Cooper at the ho&s;pital, reque&s;ting advice in ca&s;es of the fe|ver, to which Dr. Ru&s;h wrote an an&s;wer acknowledging the uncertainty of <HI>any</HI> preci&s;e method of treatment in <HI>all</HI> ca&s;es, and that bleeding and mercurials were not, in every &s;tage, and every appearance of the fever, a proper mode of treatment. He concludes, acknowledging the dif|ficulties tho&s;e Phy&s;icians had to meet, &s;carcely ever having an opportu|nity of commencing their treatment until an advanced &s;tate of the di&s;|ea&s;e, much of the &s;ucce&s;s in which, depended on a particular <HI>hour</HI> of application. Some, he &s;aid, "in 1797 he occa&s;ionally lo&s;t, even after the application of bleeding and mercurials.]&mdash;From which it appears that the new &s;y&s;tem of treatment, was not the infalliable cure which
<PB REF="037103_0029_100D32AFEBAF4210">
was &s;uppo&s;ed. But whether this medicine was found to an&s;wer the Doctor's expectation, I know not, my object is to prove that there was more than one method of counteracting that di&s;ea&s;e, and that it was the bu&s;ine&s;s of tho&s;e who had the misfortune to be expo&s;ed to the danger, to make their ob&s;ervations, with freedom on tho&s;e various modes, as much as experiment was the privilege of the practitioners. I take the principle of the Law to be, that your minds &s;hould be well &s;atisfied, either <HI>from an internal evidence of the publication, or from concomitant circumstances, that the writer had a malicious intent.</HI> This principle is well e&s;tabli&s;hed in the books: &s;ee Buller's Ni&s;i Prius p. 8. Where it is plain that the <HI>git</HI> of the expre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be MALICE, in order to con|&s;titute it a crime in the eye of the law. And again p. 110. &s;ame book "the words mu&s;t be malicious, as well as fal&s;e, to &s;upport an action for &s;lander." If it is ju&s;tifiable to &s;how that words u&s;ed with a &s;incere and liberal intention, in order to prevent mi&s;chief, is harmle&s;s, is not that man ju&s;tifiable, who &s;eeing a dangerous &s;y&s;tem likely to predo|minate, who prevents, as much as lies in his power, that &s;y&s;tem being put into action? This I con&s;ider as a very e&s;&s;ential ground of our de|fence.</P>
<P>We contend that Mr. Cobbett exerci&s;ed a right given him by the laws and Con&s;titution of this State; no law required him to publi&s;h, but he had liberty &s;o to do, and he is far from de&s;erving that odium with which he is now &s;tigmatized. That men's language, and modes of expre&s;&s;ion will differ according to their talents and education, I pre&s;ume you will all allow. When I &s;ay this, I hope you will not conceive me to mean that the whole of this man's merit con&s;i&s;ted in the &s;currility with which he treated his opponent. Here I may ju&s;ti|fiably apply the ob&s;ervation of Dr. John&s;on, that "tho&s;e who think profoundly will expre&s;s them&s;elves differently from the common accep|tation." This profundity of thought could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to be an attribute of my client; no doubt, he &s;poke from his momentary &s;en&s;a|tions. But for communicating the&s;e ob&s;ervations to the public, is the law to be appealed to in this &s;olemn and expre&s;&s;ive manner? Is the &s;trong arm of ju&s;tice to be called up, becau&s;e the little forms of &s;ocie|ty are &s;uppo&s;ed to be attacked by an individual! No, &s;uch is not the fixed principle of the law, nor of common ju&s;tice. The law will be found to &s;tate it as a principle, that in no in&s;tance where the party has gone wrong through the impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;beyond the bounds of &s;trict decency and propriety, that for this cau&s;e alone, the plaintiff is to recover damages. Salkeld 693 &s;ays, that "to &s;ay a ju&s;tice is a fool, an a&s;s, a blockhead, or a bufflehead, is not indictable, unle&s;s the words are in them&s;elves &s;uch as &s;how an intention to deprive the party get|ting his livelihood." The&s;e are rough expre&s;&s;ions, but it appears not indictable.</P>
<P>[Some di&s;tinction was here remarked by the court to exi&s;t between words that are "indictable," and words that are "actionable."]</P>
<P>Mr. Rawle contended that unle&s;s the party could &s;how that he had &s;u&s;tained &s;ome injury by the u&s;ing of the words, no damages could be laid; but he ob&s;erved that their opponents had not thought proper to prove any &s;pecial damages, from which it mu&s;t be deducted by a jury that none were &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P><PB REF="037103_0030_100D32B4872E0340">
In di&s;cu&s;&s;ing a matter of public intere&s;t, the amount of damages, if the jury &s;hould think proper to find for the plaintiff, mu&s;t depend on the &s;ituation and ability of the per&s;on who undertook to di&s;cu&s;s it. Be&s;ides, the powers of men's minds are not always alike. Truth is frequently attacked by ridicule, much le&s;s can we expect a public pro|fe&s;&s;ion to remain exempt. Pope &s;ays
<Q><L><HI>Safe from the Bar, the Pulpit and the Throne,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But truth is touch'd by "ridicule" alone.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>The enquiry always is in the ca&s;e of &s;candal. "Is it a matter in which the intere&s;ts of the nation are implicated?" If it is not; if it is a matter of public di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, as in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, it has ever been con&s;idered as harmle&s;s, though perhaps poignant ridicule. We find nothing in the declaration but words which relate to the public prac|tice and medical &s;y&s;tem of Dr. Ru&s;h. We were told that proofs of the malicious de&s;ign of our client would be produced; we have heard the evidence of three per&s;ons brought here to prove the malice a&s;&s;ert|ed. But neither of them has related an item whereupon to found that accu&s;ation. A clear proof to me, and mu&s;t be to you, Gentlemen, that no malicious de&s;ign, a temper and di&s;po&s;ition ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the conviction of the defendant&mdash;no malicious de&s;ign did exi&s;t.</P>
<P>The effort made to &s;upport malice from the evidence of Dr. Dewees, re&s;pecting the eulogium on Dr. Rittenhou&s;e, to me, is very feeble; for, from the words of the witne&s;s and the concomitant circum&s;tances, it is clear the attack was to be of a <HI>political</HI> nature, on account of po|litical principles publicly delivered. Change it, and &s;ay it was to be again&s;t the man, it mu&s;t be proved to have been carried into execution.</P>
<P>Another gentleman relates a conver&s;ation with Mr. Cobbett in Oct. 1798, about the con&s;equences of his publications. Mr. Cobbett then declared that he did not think his writing could have any effect, and at la&s;t he declares that he &s;hould not have attacked the practice of Dr. Ru&s;h, if the Doctor had not been the author of it. The true meaning of that expre&s;&s;ion, it will be difficult for you to a&s;certain: but if you under&s;tand it not fully, you are not to receive the lea&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ion from it. Perhaps it was this: if it was an ob&s;cure practiti|oner, a man of no note, it would not be worth my notice. But mark the difference. If a man, &s;uch as the Doctor has been held up to you,&mdash;not only the fir&s;t in America, but almo&s;t, if not quite, in the whole univer&s;e; &s;uch a man inculcates principles, and draws others into the adoption of them: a new &s;y&s;tem in the hands of &s;uch a man merited Mr. Cobbett's attention, in his editorial capacity; and I think he was ju&s;tifiable in thinking him a proper per&s;on for attack. Gentlemen, there mu&s;t be &s;omething more than mere &s;ugge&s;tion; there mu&s;t be &s;omething to prove the vi&s;cio&s;ity of the writings; or you mu&s;t give a verdict for the defendant.</P>
<P>Our client is ab&s;ent, he has re&s;ted his ca&s;e with you to give your deci&s;ion upon his rights of publication; we claim that right for him, a right which every free man is entitled to at your hands, and for him, I think we &s;hall not claim of you in vain. The farther exami|nation

into the publications and the evidences produced, I &s;hall leave to my colleagues, who I have no doubt will be able to prove to you that no &s;uch malice as is charged, is intended or is any way in|cluded. I will only remind you of one apparent incon&s;i&s;tency in the rea&s;oning of our opponent; If the &s;y&s;tem and practice of Dr. Ru&s;h has been &s;o u&s;eful, &s;o infallible, as you have been made to &s;uppo&s;e, in order that you may give judgment for large damages, it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e that the feeble efforts of Mr. Cobbett could not de&s;troy his celebrity, or injure that &s;y&s;tem, and therefore it could be but little or no offence for him to expre&s;s his opinion.</P>
<P>With you I &s;hall leave the weight of my arguments; we have no evidence to produce, but I tru&s;t you will &s;ee the ju&s;tice of our defence.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="address to the jury">
<HEAD>HON. MR. HARPER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the Jury,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE que&s;tion in this ca&s;e is not whether the plaintiff is a phy&s;ician of eminence, a man of worth, a peaceable citizen, a good father, or a tender hu&s;band,&mdash;was this the point to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, we mu&s;t &s;hrink from the oppo&s;ition, and allow the claim to be in his favor, nor is it whether our client has offended again&s;t decorum, and every principle of civility and good manners,&mdash;or it would be equally difficult to make out a defence. The que&s;tion is, whether, in the&s;e publications, con|tained in the declaration, which has been read, the defendant was ac|tuated by a de&s;ign to injure Dr. Ru&s;h in his per&s;onal character, or to injure him as a phy&s;ician, or to run down and laugh out of counte|nance a practice which he con&s;idered would have a mi&s;chievous ten|dency. Gentlemen as you mu&s;t be of one or the other of the&s;e opi|nions, your verdict mu&s;t be for the plaintiff or for the defendant: If from the whole of the te&s;timony you &s;hould be of opinion that the de|fendant, in making the&s;e publications, was induced merely by a de&s;ire to overthrow a &s;y&s;tem of medicine which he thought mi&s;chievous, you are bound to give him your verdict. And, why? Becau&s;e this acti|on is brought for the <HI>malicious</HI> de&s;ign with which it is &s;aid he u&s;ed tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>What is malice?</P>
<P>Malice in its pre&s;ent application mu&s;t be an attempt and de&s;ign to injure the plaintiff in his per&s;onal, or in his profe&s;&s;ional character. When this ingredient is not made out, either from its appearance on the very face of the action, or by direct inference, the action of &s;lan|der cannot be &s;upported. This is an obvious and incontrovertable fact. No man has a right to attack another in his profe&s;&s;ional pur&s;uits, &s;o as to rob him of the fruits of his indu&s;trious efforts, but every man has a right to attack a ruinous &s;y&s;tem, and whether a &s;y&s;tem is ruinous or mi&s;chievous, <HI>he</HI> who makes the attack, and <HI>he alone</HI> is to be the judge, becau&s;e if I lift my hand again&s;t a &s;et of opinions or practices which I hold to be evil to &s;ociety, I mu&s;t fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;e my liberties or privileges, or tho&s;e of &s;ociety to be in danger, before I &s;hould exerci&s;e my freedom of opinion.</P>
<P><PB REF="037103_0032_100D32B89F3EA458">
I will admit that if, in the combat of opinions or practices, I throw any unnece&s;&s;ary per&s;onal reflections, and attack the individual holding tho&s;e opinions, if I go beyond his opinions, and abu&s;e his per&s;on; if I go beyond his per&s;on, and traduce his character, then indeed the pretence that I meant only to attack his opinions, would not avail me in a court of ju&s;tice; it would be &s;uppo&s;ed merely a cloak, merely a fallacious excu&s;e, and therefore would fairly be actionable, and &s;ubject me to puni&s;hment. The que&s;tion, then, will recur whether William Cobbett meant to attack Dr. Ru&s;h's &s;y&s;tem, or his per&s;onal and pro|fe&s;&s;ional character? If the latter &s;hould appear to be his de&s;ign, he &s;urely has &s;tepped beyond due bounds. The utmo&s;t latitude of ad|mi&s;&s;ion that I &s;hall grant in this ca&s;e is, that if attempts are made to bring a phy&s;ician into general di&s;repute, then the injured party may claim retribution from the laws of his country. Having gone thus far, let us enquire how far the&s;e ingredients exi&s;t in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. Whether there be, in the paragraphs upon which this action is found|ed, any thing from which malice can be fairly and properly deducted, or whether the only de&s;ign of the defendant was to overturn, if he could by argument, that part of the practice of Dr. Ru&s;h which con|&s;i&s;ted in "BLEEDING" and "PURGING" in the yellow fever.</P>
<P>We will read the paragraphs, compare the evidences with them, and &s;ee whether this di&s;po&s;ition is contained in them.</P>
<P>[Mr. H. here read the paragraph of September 19th, 1797.]</P>
<P>Before I enter into the examination, I will admit that the &s;ame &s;tudied language which well-bred men ought to u&s;e, is omitted, and that the &s;ame &s;tile and decorum is not u&s;ed which, if I were to com|bat a public &s;y&s;tem, I &s;hould think it right to u&s;e.&mdash;But are we to wonder at it? Are we to wonder that writers, in a controver&s;y, in which they had excited &s;o much acrimony, even among the members of the facul|ty them&s;elves, &s;hould be led too far? Nay, have we not heard it &s;trik|ingly exemplified in the conduct of the Gentleman who opened this cau&s;e! Gentlemen in the Legi&s;lature do not always avoid this unbe|coming practice of per&s;onal abu&s;e. But although that fact would not ju&s;tify the man, ought we not to look with &s;ome little excu&s;e upon the author of a new&s;paper? If this con&s;ideration ought not to pardon the offence, it ought at lea&s;t to extenuate it.</P>
<P>Laying a&s;ide what is merely indecorus; what is merely har&s;h lan|guage, let us enquire what is the &s;ub&s;tance and meaning, and the total amount of the charges.</P>
<P>Having read the article entitled <HI>"Medical Puffing,"</HI> Mr. H. a&s;ked if there was any thing like &s;lander in that piece; if &s;o, hardly a new&s;|paper which was printed in the United States, but might be made a &s;ubject of enquiry by a Jury.&mdash;I do not, re&s;umed Mr. H. ju&s;tify the language; but what does it amount to? It calls an eminent phy&s;ician a remor&s;ele&s;s bleeder. What is that? It is that he pur&s;ued bleeding too far. But have not &s;ome of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable medical men &s;aid that it is remor&s;ele&s;s and de&s;tructive? There are &s;uch. The idea con|veyed is nothing to you; whether bleeding in his practice, is pu&s;hed too far, or whether it is not a &s;ubject of your enquiry; but whether this man meant more than to expo&s;e that &s;y&s;tem which was extreme in his view
<PB REF="037103_0033_100D32BA96608018">
is a proper &s;ubject for your enquiry. Was it not wrong that a ruinous &s;y&s;tem &s;hould have been per&s;i&s;ted in, when human life was &s;o material|ly connected? This was &s;o con&s;idered by him, and he thought it his duty to expo&s;e it. I am well convinced that it was not only unbe|coming language, but I believe it to be very untrue, but is it a &s;lan|der? No, it is merely unmeaning ribaldry. Suppo&s;e, I &s;ay, a man is in the habit of getting him&s;elf puffed in the paper: he may be laughed at, but could do nothing in it. He might get him&s;elf puffed, and yet be a very able phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>"Blood, blood, they cry more blood."</P>
<P>To be &s;ure this is very hyperbolical, but &s;trip it of its exaggeration, and is it not true? Was it not common, during that period, for the&s;e ideas to be reiterated through the papers and pamphlets of the city day after day? <HI>The free use of the lancet, the free use of the lancet,</HI> was con&s;tantly repeated by the medical men in favor of that &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>As to calling a man a &s;hamele&s;s &s;illy puff, and in general, the letter of Dr. Tilton, wherein he is called a &s;our wry-faced democrat, I do not know how it came to be introduced, or what it has to do with an acti|on brought by Dr. Ru&s;h! I have heard a very good character of Dr. Tilton, but if he is "a &s;our wry-faced incorrigible democrat," I am &s;orry for it. As to the epithet of "Ma&s;ter bleeder," I &s;ee no harm in its in|troduction; it is no &s;lander, but an high eulogium, rai&s;ing him to a pre-eminence, rather than giving any abu&s;e. The que&s;tion re&s;pecting mercurial purges is then introduced, "Is it good for Sans culotti&s;m, Doctor?" I wi&s;h it was, gentlemen, for if &s;o, it would be a ready cure for a great number of per&s;ons, who, I fear, are now utterly incura|ble. Comparing mercury to Samp&s;on, and &s;peaking of its ravages, Mr. Harper did not conceive it per&s;onally applicable to Dr. Ru&s;h, but to the &s;y&s;tem, which was particularly pointed at in reference to the "Ru&s;hites."</P>
<P>Not Dr. Ru&s;h but his partizans, which amounted to nothing. Is it &s;lan|der, &s;aid Mr. Harper, to &s;ay to a gentleman, when we contend in another place, (Congre&s;s Hall) that certain political opinions go to the &s;ubver&s;ion of Government, or in other in&s;tances tend to rob the country, &amp;c. No, far otherwi&s;e, a great di&s;tinction is always held between a man, per&s;on|ally, and his principles. Mi&s;erable would be the times, were it not &s;o, and much more mi&s;erable would it be if we could not be permitted to call in que&s;tion the practice of a phy&s;ician, without being &s;ubjected to an expen&s;ive action for &s;lander. The only meaning of the&s;e words is, that it is a mi&s;taken principle to attach to certain practice the vir|tue it has not, for that it has occa&s;ioned the death of many, rather than recovered them from di&s;ea&s;e. If the words had been that Doctor Ru&s;h killed more than he cured, it would have been actionable on good grounds, but it is only vaguely the "Ru&s;hites," &amp;c.</P>
<P>The next paragraph is in 25 September, &s;igned "a tavern keeper." Here we only find Dr. Ru&s;h's name mentioned as having publi&s;hed a book on the yellow fever, and his being a great patron of the art of blood-letting. This is known to all America and Europe, it has never been denied, but it is not &s;lander. It might with propriety be called a piece highly ridiculing the practice of blood-letting: I believe it
<PB REF="037103_0034_100D32BCC3EEAEF0">
was &s;o intended&mdash;but &s;hall &s;uch a piece of <HI>ridicule</HI> be made the foun|dation of an action of &s;lander? If &s;o, &s;ome of the mo&s;t admired produc|tions in every age ought to be con&s;idered as &s;landers. In every age ri|dicule of this &s;ort has been re&s;orted to, and where it does not run into &s;candal it is approved. But I &s;ay this does not, and I know you will &s;ay by your verdict, that it does not run to that length.</P>
<P>Mr. Harper then read the article in&s;erted September 26, 1797, which he contended contained nothing injurious to the reputation of Dr. Ru&s;h as a phy&s;ician, nor as a man, nor would it tend in the lea&s;t to deprive him of a livelihood, one of which mu&s;t be proved in order to &s;ub&s;tantiate the action. As to the terms "potent quack," and "me|dical puffer"&mdash;the words are very indecent, but it is always a principle of ob&s;ervation that &s;uch <HI>low, unmeaning ribaldry</HI> always recoils on its projector. Far be it from me to ju&s;tify, or even extenuate &s;uch lan|guage, but that it is no offence in a law view is ea&s;y to prove. Con|tempt is the only puni&s;hment it can have.</P>
<P>Next Mr. Harper took up the article of September 29, 1797, pre|face "A PUFF equal to Dr. Ru&s;h's." Here Mr. H. &s;aid was a puff introduced the mo&s;t ridiculous and ab&s;urd which could be conceived, and he called it EQUAL to <HI>Dr. Rush's.</HI> Surely he &s;aid it was EQUAL, and it could be no &s;lander to &s;ay &s;o. It was very indecorous to be &s;ure, to bring in the name of &s;o re&s;pectable a character as Dr. Ru&s;h, when &s;uch an extravagant piece was introduced, but it did not tend to le&s;|&s;en the man in his reputation and fame, and therefore could be no &s;lan|der. This Spil&s;bury had invented a remedy to cure impurities of the blood, but was it not a more perfect cure to let out that foul blood? Certainly &s;o. The indecent epithet of <HI>master Sangrado</HI> he could not defend; it was very unbecoming to apply it to &s;o re&s;pectable a cha|racter. But &s;uppo&s;e a man was called after in the &s;treet by this name, could he &s;upport an action for &s;lander upon it? No, actions of &s;lander are not to be brought for <HI>abuse</HI> but <HI>injury.</HI>&mdash;This <HI>Sangrado</HI> is mentioned in a novel as a famous quack, who u&s;ed to take blood and give water to his patients until he brought them to the grave.</P>
<P>Mr. Harper again contended, that from the whole &s;um of the evi|dence it was clear that not the man, but the mode of practice, which he con&s;idered dangerous, was the object of attack. He then took up the article in&s;erted in Porcupine's Gazette, Oct. 5, 1797, extracted from Fenno's Gazette, &s;ub&s;equent to the action being entered, which he &s;aid, the greater part of it, was only an extenuation, becau&s;e it ex|pre&s;sly &s;ays, that none of the paragraphs made the foundation of the action, were meant more than to combat "an erroneous &s;y&s;tem." This printer con&s;idered him&s;elf to be unju&s;tly a&s;&s;ailed by the action, and therefore it is no wonder if the &s;ub&s;equent publications are acrimonious; but is this a proof of his criminality in the fir&s;t in&s;tance? Even tho&s;e &s;ub&s;equent publications go principally to the &s;y&s;tem, and &s;ay very lit|tle about the man him&s;elf. If the malice was intended at the time he u&s;hered the publications for which he was &s;ued, he would not have waited to di&s;play it in the future ones.&mdash;Gentlemen, the &s;ub&s;equent publications cannot &s;upport the action, as they took place &s;ince the action was commenced, and flow only from the re&s;entment natural to
<PB REF="037103_0035_100D32BFCD358BC8">
a man who con&s;idered him&s;elf unju&s;tly pro&s;ecuted; they cannot there|fore be called as a proof of the motive with which the fir&s;t were written, except the malice had been plainly expre&s;&s;ed in them, which is not the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Verbal te&s;timony is next produced: three gentlemen of re&s;pectabi|lity for their age, appear in court, but I am &s;orry the action could not be &s;upported without re&s;orting to private conver&s;ations, perhaps u&s;ed in confidence, and certainly without a view of its going farther than the &s;pot where it was u&s;ed. This particularly referred to the two fir&s;t. But it may be laudable in the gentlemen to come and volun|teer them&s;elves in &s;upport of a man, their friend and patron, whom they con&s;ider a&s;&s;ailed. I will admit that the expre&s;&s;ions u&s;ed by the defendant, was proof of his vindictive &s;pirit, and were very improper, but I a&s;k what influence it can have on the action now before you? This &s;trong re&s;entment was in con&s;equence of his being &s;ued by Dr. Ru&s;h. If it proves any thing, it is that the defendant was certain of the inju&s;tice of the action, he having, legally &s;peaking, done no harm, at which his mind revolted, and being very much agitated at the men|tion of the &s;uit by Dr. Mea&s;e, the ebullition of his inflamed mind bur&s;t forth into an unwarrantable expre&s;&s;ion. Is this the mark of <HI>malice,</HI> &s;ettled, cool, deliberate malice? Malice &s;peaks le&s;s and does more, than is apparent in any part of the defendant's conduct. You may call him ill tempered, unamiable, har&s;h, &amp;c. if you plea&s;e; in &s;o doing you do him ju&s;tice, but to call an ha&s;ty expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>malice,</HI> is a perver&s;ion of terms.</P>
<P>The te&s;timony of Dr. Dewees amounts to le&s;s than the la&s;t. The defendant was di&s;plea&s;ed at certain pa&s;&s;ages in an eulogium &s;poken by Dr. Ru&s;h, and he &s;aid the Doctor had better have confined him&s;elf to medicine. This to be &s;ure was very impertinent, for he had nothing to do with it; but it was not criminal. What he meant by its being "too republican" does not appear. I have read it, and with plea&s;ure; but he or any man certainly had a right to find fault with it, if they di&s;liked it. He farther &s;aid he would attack the Doctor about it. Does this mean that he would commence a vindictive attack upon the Doctor, and endeavor to wound him in his reputation or profe&s;&s;ion? No, gentlemen, this is not to be inferred. It was a determination to attack the principle advanced, to expo&s;e it to ridicule, &s;o that it &s;hould not have the effect which it was intended to have. It could not po&s;|&s;ibly refer to any attack on his bu&s;ine&s;s, and therefore cannot &s;tamp a malicious intent upon words u&s;ed for another purpo&s;e &s;o long after|wards. It appears that Mr. Cobbett did afterwards employ Dr. Dewees in his family, and recommended him to &s;ome of his friends. I am very glad of it, I believe him to have merited that recommendation, but this is no proof that it was not to the &s;y&s;tem, but the man that Cobbett aimed at, for although Dr. Dewees was employed by him in other ca&s;es, he might not have done it, had the yellow fever came into his family, if he had, it would have changed the que&s;tion, and proved the &s;candal.</P>
<P>The evidence of Dr. Cox goes only to prove the opinion of Cobbett that all he could &s;ay would do no harm, &s;ince the attack upon the
<PB REF="037103_0036_100D32C20D4D1EF0">
bleeding was well known not to have flowed from profe&s;&s;ional know|ledge. This was paying homage to the character of Dr. Ru&s;h.&mdash;If a man of no note had introduced the &s;y&s;tem, he would not have &s;aid a word about it, but &s;ince a man of Dr. Ru&s;h's talents, had advocated it, it was an object worth attacking with all his might. But wherein is the coincidence between this te&s;timony, and that related by Dr. Dewees? The circum&s;tance of the eulogium occurred in December, '96, or in January following, but the evidence of Dr. Coxe relates what did not occur until the September following, that if Dr. Ru&s;h had not been the promoter of this purging and bleeding &s;y&s;tem, he &s;hould not have thought it worth while to &s;ay much about it. There can be no relation or connection between the two, becau&s;e one refers to expre&s;&s;ions which he denominated "too republican" for which he meant to attack him; but the other is wholly bent towards his &s;y&s;|tem of phy&s;ic. It was the weight of authority, &s;o great a man as Dr. Ru&s;h being at the head of that <HI>disapproved</HI> &s;y&s;tem, which called forth, not his malice, but his animadver&s;ions. It does appear to me that there was no appearance of the ingredient which the law calls malice, and which is nece&s;&s;ary to vitiate his conduct, through the whole pro|gre&s;s of the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and that this man was not injured in his name, fame or reputation: in his name as a man in &s;ociety, or in his dome&s;|tic connections; in his fame as a man of &s;kill and profe&s;&s;ion; or in his reputation as a Phy&s;ician, and con&s;equently there is no &s;lander to his character.</P>
<P>We have heard much of the family of the plaintiff, and of the keen feelings of his re&s;pectable wife, of which not a doubt can be enter|tained. I &s;hould never have thought it my duty to have hazarded my re&s;pectability by &s;tanding here to advocate a man who &s;hould &s;lander &s;o eminently u&s;eful a character as Dr. Ru&s;h, or his very re&s;pectable wife or family: far be it from me, I &s;hould rather have con&s;igned him and his cau&s;e to the fate it would de&s;erve. My profe&s;&s;ional name &s;hould never have borne the blot &s;uch conduct would ju&s;tly attach to it. But this I conceive not to be the ca&s;e. That my client has over&s;tepped the bounds of good manners and decorum, I have admitted, but that he had a right to run down what he believed to be a mi&s;|chievous &s;y&s;tem, I have contended for, and &s;till wi&s;h to impre&s;s upon your minds. His conduct mu&s;t meet with &s;trong di&s;approbation, but agreeable to the rules of law and ju&s;tice he merits your verdict, becau&s;e neither a breach of good manners, nor har&s;h opprobrious epithets can be con&s;trued to mean <HI>slander.</HI> How reprehen&s;ible &s;oever his conduct, if he has not &s;landered the good name, &s;ame or pur&s;uits in life of Dr. Ru&s;h, I repeat that William Cobbett has a demand of ju&s;tice at your hands, and that is to acquit him of the declaration.</P>

<HEAD>MR. MOSES LEVY. BY YOUR HONORS' LEAVE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the Jury,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE enquiry before us is of a nature to demand our mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration. From the attention which has been given to it through|out the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, by you and the Court, the utmo&s;t candor is evident, and a ju&s;t conclu&s;ion certain. The &s;uit you are now to con&s;ider &s;hould be perfectly open to your under&s;tanding; its nature &s;hould be explain|ed, and &s;ome of the errors corrected which have too generally e&s;caped from the coun&s;el for the defendant, though, I pre&s;ume without inten|tion.</P>
<P>This is not legally a &s;pecial action for &s;lander; it is true the action is to recover damages for grievous and unprovoked &s;lander, but in its nature, this is an action for a libel. An action for <HI>slander</HI> and an ac|tion for a <HI>libel</HI> is differently under&s;tood in courts of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Words may irritate and rankle; they may even bla&s;t the character of a man upon whom they are &s;poken, but they peri&s;h the moment they pa&s;s out of the mouth of the &s;peaker, and the &s;hortne&s;s of their dura|tion le&s;&s;ens their importance. But what is committed to paper,&mdash;what is <HI>printed,</HI> has a la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion, and is capable of much, and univer|&s;al mi&s;chief. It exi&s;ts through ages, and is not confined to the &s;eat of its birth, but may extend even to the remote&s;t parts of the earth. There can be no bounds of its effects. If &s;lander, then, is puni&s;hable by the law, with how much more nicety &s;hould reputation and private honor, be guarded from attacks by writing. For words, however public, the law has therefore provided no puni&s;hment: the law does not con&s;ider the public peace &s;o far injured thereby, as to command the public offi|cer to i&s;&s;ue pro&s;ecution. But words committed to paper demands more attention, becau&s;e more exten&s;ive are its effects. Taking notice, there|fore, as the law does by this pointed di&s;tinction between words &s;poken and &s;lander committed to the pre&s;s, the offence is defined.</P>
<P>In relation to words &s;poken, &s;ee 3 Black&s;tone 123, "Words which may impair, or hurt a man's trade or livelihood, as to call a trade&s;man a bankrupt, <HI>a physician a quack,</HI> or a lawyer a knave." The&s;e are an exception to the general propo&s;ition which I have laid down, that words are harmle&s;s. The&s;e words are con&s;idered as a good ground for action, becau&s;e they attack in a vulnerable point, and it remains with time defendant to &s;how that there was no malice intended in the u&s;e of them. Thus we find that the burden is put on the defendant.</P>
<P>Another way of attacking a man's reputation, and a more &s;erious one is by printing, writing, exhibiting pictures or &s;igns, &amp;c. &s;o as to &s;et any one in an odious and diminutive light, &s;ee 3 Black. 125. Every libel has a tendency to breaking the peace, by provoking the per&s;on li|belled to break it. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to multiply authorities to prove the law is pointedly again&s;t the defendant, he having written what
<PB REF="037103_0038_100D32C64F65D560">
would have been a libel even if &s;poken. I &s;hall take it for granted then, that this new&s;paper attacking of Dr. Ru&s;h, as "quack," "potent quack," "grand empyric," &amp;c. "who had &s;lain his tens of thou&s;ands," is a gro&s;s and infamous libel, except it &s;hould be made to appear other|wi&s;e by extenuating, and giving it a mild a&s;pect.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the principles of law laid down by my colleague, in his opening addre&s;s were ju&s;t, and con&s;i&s;tent with the Engli&s;h books of law. If, for a moment, his zeal carried him into a &s;tate of efferve&s;|cence, for which he is blamed by our opponents, it is what the mo&s;t moderate man, who is warmly attached to reputation and charac|ter, who has read what was in&s;erted again&s;t the plaintiff, can &s;carcely refrain from &s;howing. Who could re&s;train a warmth of expre&s;&s;ion at &s;eeing a worthy, valuable citizen &s;o lavi&s;hly abu&s;ed without provoca|tion; without ever appearing to have &s;poken with the defendant, or even glanced at his principles or conduct. Farther, we find this ma|levolent intention repeatedly pur&s;ued in, even after a pro&s;ecution was commenced.&mdash;It certainly will not be, nor has it been contended, that character is not a &s;acred thing; no one &s;hall touch it with impunity. Character is the road to private happine&s;s and public confidence and honor. De&s;troy the characters of men, and it di&s;&s;olves the union which blends together &s;ociety, nor wealth, nor real merit can conceal contempt. So careful is the law to pre&s;erve character inviolable, that even the memory of the decea&s;ed is &s;acred, and the offence of traducing that memory is puni&s;hed by law. It is not enough, then, to prove that the &s;lander cannot operate to injury; no, the imputation ca&s;t upon the memory of the dead, might lead to acts of violence between the living, and thus the peace be broken. Such a libel as this upon the character of a man, even after he had been dead fifteen years, would be &s;ufficiently atrocious to ju&s;tify an indictment and puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>If the importance of reputation is &s;o expre&s;sly acknowledged by the laws of this country, and if the&s;e laws are deemed &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the public peace, how are they to be carried into effect, but in one of two ways, legally.&mdash;Fir&s;t by public pro&s;ecution, in which the defendant is not at liberty to give the truth of the libel in evidence, or &s;econdly by an action for &s;lander, in which he is at liberty to prove the truth, which if he can do, exculpates him from legal blame. Of the&s;e two, Dr. Ru&s;h was not at a lo&s;s to know which was mo&s;t proper for him to adopt: it was rea&s;on enough for him to commence a civil action, becau&s;e it gave the defendant an opportunity to bring forward the truth in ju&s;ti|fication, if he could do it. This civil action being commenced, you are the organs through whom alone we claim ju&s;tice. A jury taken from the ma&s;s of the people, is a permanent and invaluable in&s;titution: they can be&s;t e&s;timate the value of private or public character, and di&s;pen&s;e ju&s;tice in proportion to the quality of the offence. The of|fice of a jury is permanent; however the per&s;ons compo&s;ing it, may vary or die, yet the in&s;titution ever remains, and they are the judges on whom the law has re&s;ted property, per&s;onal liberty, and per&s;onal character. In ca&s;es where a jury e&s;timate damages too high, wherein damages can be ea&s;ily e&s;timated, the court have a controlling juri&s;diction over their verdict, by ordering a new trial, and referring it to ano|ther
<PB REF="037103_0039_100D32C91F483D60">
jury. But in an action which refers to character, to cha&s;tity, or to the honor of an individual, you are the uncontrolled judges. Mat|ters of property the court is &s;uppo&s;ed to be able to e&s;timate, but of the value of character, &amp;c. the jury are &s;uppo&s;ed to be able to give the be&s;t judgment. If therefore the character of a valuable and re&s;pec|table man is wantonly and wickedly attacked, it lies with you, as the guardians of your fellow citizens, to e&s;timate the damages. <HI>You</HI> have characters of your own, and you know the importance of pre&s;erving them inviolate; all of you follow &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, and you cannot be ignorant of the violence and effects of an attack on the means you u&s;e to execute that bu&s;ine&s;s. You, who are merchants, mu&s;t conceive the danger a new&s;paper publication, declaring you a bankrupt would be to you: it would wound your reputation &s;o as to effectuate your ruin, by &s;topping your&punc; credit and your trade. It would be no excu&s;e to your opponent to &s;ay it was but a je&s;t, becau&s;e the defamation would be effected, and you mu&s;t &s;uffer. Picture to your&s;elves, if you can, how you would feel, if preci&s;ely &s;ituated as is the defend|ant! of what avail would it be to you to be told that it was only <HI>ridicule?</HI> Suppo&s;e an infamous picture was put before your door&mdash;&s;up|po&s;e a pair of horns, de&s;cribing the conduct of your wife, and that repeatedly, would you be &s;atisfied at being told it was "<HI>a test of truth</HI>" and that "<HI>ridicule could do you no injury?</HI>"&mdash;Suppo&s;e it was a label put, that you were guilty of this or that &s;pecies of &s;windling, or wor&s;e, &s;uppo&s;e this to be in&s;erted in the new&s;papers,&mdash;&s;uppo&s;e that in&s;tead of low, indecent, and ru&s;&s;ian-like vulgarity, you were attacked with a keen &s;atire,&mdash;would it be to your benefit that you were cut with a <HI>sharp</HI> knife? No, it mu&s;t have a direct tendency to ruin, or material injury, and notwith&s;tanding the utmo&s;t u&s;e of philo&s;ophy in calming the mind, to &s;ay it is only ridicule will not avail to compen&s;ate the injury.</P>
<P>Let us enquire what was the &s;ituation of Dr. Ru&s;h at the time this &s;lander was circulated. He re&s;ided in Philadelphia, and it was at a period when mo&s;t had de&s;erted it who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed property &s;ufficient to make their e&s;cape, from a &s;en&s;e of the danger to which they &s;hould otherwi&s;e expo&s;e them&s;elves. He had property to fly, but he cho&s;e to remain. Can you &s;uppo&s;e, Gentlemen, that he remained here unruf|fled? His object in &s;taying could not be to enhance his private pro|perty, for it could not be profitable for him to &s;tay when mo&s;t or all of his profitable patients had gone. No, his object in &s;taying was the ge|neral good&mdash;to mark the &s;teps of the di&s;order, and the &s;en&s;ible effects of the remedies which he applied, and to lay before the public a &s;eries of facts and ob&s;ervations which might in future, either keep the pe&s;|tilence out of our land, or if invaded again, re&s;train its progre&s;s.&mdash;Yes, at this important moment, in the execution of a great &s;ervice; when every citizen of Philadelphia ought to have acknowledged their obli|gations to the man who would brave Death for the general good&mdash;in&s;tead of public thanks, the great points for which he was contending, and the great labors he was executing, were attacked in a public news|paper with the mo&s;t degrading ridicule, &s;currility and vulgar je&s;t. Yes, the defendant then infamou&s;ly attacked his profe&s;&s;ional &s;kill, in order
<PB REF="037103_0040_100D32CBCB54B9F0">
to bring the man into deri&s;ion, and depre&s;s his name as one of the mo&s;t dangerous of the human race.&mdash;Gentlemen, what does &s;uch a man de|&s;erve; a man who does not claim the honor of a &s;ingle <HI>stick</HI> among us; a man who has taken the pre&s;umption of degrading the mo&s;t re|&s;pectable characters of our country, from the Pre&s;ident of the United States to the lowe&s;t citizen, whenever their &s;entiments have happened to come in contact with his. In the cour&s;e of this cau&s;e, he has &s;worn him&s;elf an Alien, and in another cau&s;e he has declared his intention of returning to his own country. Yet this man who profe&s;&s;edly de|clares him&s;elf of no country, pretended to wi&s;h Dr. Ru&s;h had &s;tuck to his medical profe&s;&s;ion, and have let alone politics! This man could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to be intere&s;ted in the politics of our country; he no doubt would have taken the part of his own country, when in collu&s;ion with this, for he glories that he is not the citizen of a republic. And &s;hall he be permitted to revile a re&s;pectable citizen of this country for do|ing that, which, if he had not done he would have merited cen&s;ure, or at lea&s;t not merited that good name now &s;o ju&s;tly given him. Dr. Ru&s;h had uttered &s;ome &s;entiments which were "too republican" for Mr. Cobbett. This furni&s;hed a clue to the &s;ub&s;equent attack which he made, not with a view to correct the medical practice; not to pre|vent the introduction, or &s;top the ravages of a dreadful di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;no, he &s;topped, as far as he was able, any examination into the truth; as much as he po&s;&s;ibly could, he weakened the force of the mind engaged in tho&s;e u&s;eful re&s;earches by clamor and abu&s;e, and the ground was, becau&s;e he was a <HI>republican!</HI> What could he mean by this declarati|on, that he would attack him for it? The re&s;ult will an&s;wer. While his republican opinions gave the offence, why did he not attempt to &s;how that tho&s;e opinions were founded upon wrong ideas of govern|ment? But not one word was ever &s;een upon that head. No, his at|tack was de&s;igned to be on a part more u&s;eful to his vicious de&s;igns, and more injurious to the man&mdash;on his reputable name as a <HI>Physician.</HI> This will account clearly for the di&s;tance of time between the threat and its accompli&s;hment. In January 1797 he threatens, and keeping in his mind the offence, he began not to put it in execution until Sep|tember following. The arrow which, was &s;tuck in his &s;ide, he did not attempt to draw out at the moment of re&s;entment, but there remaining it grew &s;tronger as it grew older&mdash;it mu&s;t remain until a fit period for making it felt. None &s;o fit as when his practice of Phy&s;ic was at its height, and the mind of his patients the mo&s;t weak and &s;u&s;ceptible.&mdash;Men differ much in opinions; to attack him therefore upon the repub|lican principles, he had laid down would not do; that was an injury not &s;ufficiently exten&s;ive, he would not attack him there; he would wound him to effect. Accordingly at the moment of trepidation and confidence he cries out "Dr. Ru&s;h has been the death of thou&s;ands." Thus he produced by &s;kill, what argument would never have effect|ed.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid Cobbett has the &s;ame right to offer his opinions, and to the liberty of the pre&s;s which others enjoy, and to examine public que&s;ti|ons, &amp;c. for which the con&s;titution is appealed to; but permit me to &s;tate to you the principle that though a right to examine into the con|duct
<PB REF="037103_0041_100D32CDEF3C1E08">
of public officers and di&s;cu&s;&s;ing public que&s;tions is there given, a right of re&s;pon&s;ibility for that examination is likewi&s;e given, in ca&s;e of the abu&s;e of that liberty. Admit that he has the right, (though in another ca&s;e it has been declared that aliens have not &s;imilar rights with citizens) there is &s;till much rea&s;on for jealou&s;y, becau&s;e, as he has not the &s;ame intere&s;t at heart with citizens, not expecting to &s;pend his days here, his di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of public que&s;tions &s;hould be care|fully looked to. Indeed I think the "cloven foot" is plainly ob&s;erva|ble in his writings. There is a &s;omething appears at the bottom, though it might not comport with his intere&s;ts to avow it. Suppo&s;e this man was inve&s;tigating a &s;y&s;tem, or &s;earching after truth, which he had a right to do, are the&s;e re&s;earches to be made with vulgarity, defamation, and &s;currility? Is this the way to come at truth? Are not ju&s;tifiable re&s;earches made by others, and with &s;ucce&s;s, without it? Surely you mu&s;t all think this the mo&s;t likely way to defeat his pre|tended object. The true mode, if I wi&s;h to convince of an opinion, is to rea&s;on with the under&s;tanding, and not traduce the character, and opinions of my pupil or opponent. What would the American people be thought of, if they could not be convinced without low abu&s;e? And what our Courts of Ju&s;tice, if this &s;landerous u&s;age was to be per|mitted with impunity?</P>
<P>The pre&s;s is of incalculable benefit; it is the great road to informa|tion. The nature of man is formed to a&s;pire after truth, but it can|not be expected by initiation, it mu&s;t come into the minds of men by a &s;eries of &s;teps, one leading to another: the pre&s;s is a very important help to this progre&s;s, becau&s;e by it we di&s;cover in one part of the world what has tran&s;pired at the mo&s;t di&s;tant part from it. Thus improve|ments in arts and &s;cience are made. It is for its ine&s;timable general u&s;e we value it. Do we value it becau&s;e it furni&s;hes any man, who is able to purcha&s;e a &s;et of types, and paper, with means to blacken ano|ther man's character, &s;o that old age, virtue nor cha&s;tity cannot throw a &s;hield round the victim of his envy?&mdash;It is nece&s;&s;ary to encourage the pre&s;s, but &s;hall it be done at the hazard of character&mdash;of all that is dear to man, his very means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence? If &s;o, in&s;tead of increa&s;|ing our knowledge and happine&s;s, it would operate as the greate&s;t cur&s;e upon frail humanity: There is no principle in government, in Philo&s;ophy, or in religion, that is &s;o &s;acred but the fangs of envy might &s;ucce&s;sfully attack through the licentious u&s;e of the pre&s;s. But if the aim of an individual is to improve the &s;ciences, or the happine&s;s of man in any way, whatever be his mode, he ought to be protected and encouraged. If his rea&s;oning is fair and candid; if his arguments are addre&s;&s;ed to the under&s;tanding; if he &s;hews a de&s;ign of increa&s;ing the ma&s;s of knowledge among mankind,&mdash;to him the pre&s;s ought to be free. It is by this means man is wre&s;ted from ignorance, and made as near to angelic as his nature will admit. If the defendant had taken the&s;e means to obtain his object&mdash;<HI>to destroy what be thought a ruinous system,</HI> as is pretended, far would it have been from the plaintiff even to have blamed him, much le&s;s commenced a &s;uit again&s;t him. The opinions of Dr. Ru&s;h were circulated from an idea that they were ju&s;t; he &s;ubmitted them to public &s;earch and enquiry. How were they to
<PB REF="037103_0042_100D32D0316F22D8">
be an&s;wered? who were the people to be convinced of their propriety or impropriety? Do the ma&s;s of the people know how to form a ju&s;t judgment on it? As for my&s;elf, my education, habit of life, nor lei|&s;ure has enabled me to form any judgment upon it; and I pre&s;ume few of you are able to &s;ay whether the &s;y&s;tem of Dr. Ru&s;h is fal&s;e or true. At the period alluded to, Philadelphia was in a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tate, and owing to the prevalence of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e in &s;everal parts of the union, commerce and wealth have been con&s;iderably impaired. Did this man endeavor to le&s;&s;en that affliction? were his efforts directed to promote public happine&s;s, or to &s;atisfy per&s;onal animo&s;ity? Gentle|men, you mu&s;t determine the&s;e points. Did he accompany his argu|ments with a &s;ingle &s;cientific remark, or give a &s;ingle argument as to the origin or nece&s;&s;ary treatment of the di&s;ea&s;e, as though he wi&s;hed to alleviate the prevailing di&s;tre&s;s? Every thing proves that he wi&s;hed not to improve the &s;y&s;tem, and why &s;hould be? he had no incitements; he declared his de&s;ign not to &s;pend his life among&s;t us, and of cour&s;e had no common intere&s;t with us. To him it was not an object whe|ther Philadelphia was de&s;olated or not. Perhaps, indeed, the reduc|tion of trade here would give him plea&s;ure: the diminution of the growing wealth of the principal cities of the United States, might af|ford him gratification, &s;ince his own country mu&s;t otherwi&s;e receive impre&s;&s;ions from our pro&s;perity. No, it is evident he did not wi&s;h to develope error, to convince men, or increa&s;e public happine&s;s, or he would have u&s;ed arguments to &s;how the fallacy of the practice e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. But he knew not, nor cared any thing about it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to prove, by the mo&s;t irrefragible evidence, the <HI>previous, concomitant,</HI> and <HI>subsequent malice</HI> of William Cobbett, from the te&s;timony you have heard.</P>
<P>There was a previous intention of attack. Before the writings i&s;&s;ued, the de&s;ign was formed. Whenever an act &s;hall appear, that corre&s;ponds with a previous declaration, we may ju&s;tly conclude a co|incidence therefrom. Thus, &s;hould a man &s;ay, "I will rai&s;e &s;uch an army, and oppo&s;e &s;uch a law:" if in nine months after, &s;uch things are done, the circum&s;tances are blended together, and it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be trea&s;on. As we ob&s;erved before, the circum&s;tances of January and September, '97 are coupled &s;o as to be impo&s;&s;ible to part them. He then really fulfilled his promi&s;e, endeavoring to make Dr. Ru&s;h appear as odious as po&s;&s;ible. I can &s;ee no excu&s;e for &s;uch epithets under the name of <HI>ridicule,</HI> but I will &s;ay, any writing that tends to &s;et a man in a ridiculous light <HI>is a libel.</HI> The words u&s;ed to ridicule the plain|tiff, might excite a laugh, but that is not all it ought to excite, as the honorable Gentleman &s;uppo&s;es, who &s;poke ju&s;t now. Shall the attick &s;alt, the elegance of language, or the keenne&s;s of a &s;atire, ex|cu&s;e a man's abu&s;e? Of what comfort would you think it to be cut with a <HI>sharp</HI> knife, and &s;hould the offender be excu&s;ed, becau&s;e the weapon was keen? Shall a man dare to bring the Pre&s;ident of the United States, or the Congre&s;s into contempt, and he be excu&s;ed un|der the name of <HI>ridicule</HI> and <HI>ribaldry?</HI> No, the laws of the United States, and of the States, provide that notwith&s;tanding the keenne&s;s of the expre&s;&s;ions, a libel &s;hall be puni&s;hed. It is not ju&s;tifiable merely
<PB REF="037103_0043_100D32D3250A4CC0">
becau&s;e it is calculated to excite a laugh. Does not the defendant repre&s;ent the plaintiff in an odious point of view, and a&s;cribe to him the murder of his fellow creatures, by the u&s;e of bleeding and mercu|ry? Can there be a more &s;evere attack upon a medical man, or upon his art than this? What kind of man mu&s;t he be, who follows a parti|cular &s;y&s;tem with callous heart and murderous hands, when he &s;ees direful effects attending that &s;y&s;tem? Who would follow &s;uch a &s;y&s;|tem of &s;laughter as this is repre&s;ented, but the mo&s;t abandoned and unfeeling wretch; and who would employ the man that &s;hould &s;o em|brue his hands in blood?&mdash;This "potent quack;" this "murderer;" this unfeeling empyric, rejoices at the murder of his fellow-citizens, and has no other way of getting over his mi&s;anthrophy, than by eu|logizing him&s;elf, or getting &s;ome weak men of his own profe&s;&s;ion to eulogize him!&mdash;Gentlemen, I a&s;k if this does not &s;et the plaintiff in a ridiculous point of view,&mdash;a fit object for the dete&s;tation of the world?</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to Spil&s;bury's anti&s;corbutic bill, it is an exemplary &s;pe|cimen of quacki&s;m&mdash;an univer&s;al no&s;trum worthy univer&s;al contempt. "There ma&s;ter Sangrado, beat that if you can." Meaning, by writing letters, and getting eulogi&s;tic an&s;wers purpo&s;ely to puff your&s;elf. In my opinion the&s;e words, and the words "a puff equal to Dr. Ru&s;h's" means no more nor le&s;s than that Dr. Ru&s;h has equalled it, and there|fore is an empyric. On the &s;econd of October Dr. Cox called on Cob|bett, when he advi&s;ed him to withold his publications, as he could not calculate on the injury they did. Notwith&s;tanding this evidence of their ill effects he went on publi&s;hing on the 5th, 6th and 20th of Oc|tober, increa&s;ing the aggravation of his crime. He &s;aid if any other man than Dr. Ru&s;h had done it, he &s;hould not have &s;o gone on. Was it that he thought Dr. Ru&s;h high in his profe&s;&s;ion, and therefore the mo&s;t proper object whereby to attack the &s;y&s;tem? No, I think it quite otherwi&s;e. Could any man hear the gentleman who &s;poke la&s;t, com|plimenting Dr. Ru&s;h on this pre-eminent &s;tation to which Mr. Cob|bett had exalted him, without laughing? Can any man think him &s;incere? I agree it was all the honorable gentleman could &s;ay, becau&s;e a ca&s;e like this mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily put ingenuity to its la&s;t &s;hift, and leave genius without even a plau&s;ible re&s;ource. No, we know better. He had called the Doctor "Sangrado" "potent quack, &amp;c:" he has a&s;per&s;ed him with "killing his tens of thou&s;and by his prepo&s;ter|ous practice" and can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, after all this, that his wri|tings were directed again&s;t the Doctor for his eminent &s;kill, and that it was honorable to him? No, we can trace it but to one cau&s;e&mdash;<HI>private, personal malice,</HI> without the lea&s;t regard to public duty, or public good. He declared he would attack, but little did he expect that this avowal would ever come again&s;t him.</P>
<P>"Let him withdraw his action, or I will per&s;ecute him while <HI>living,</HI> and his <HI>memory</HI> after he is <HI>dead.</HI>"</P>
<P>What an heart has this man? My colleague has been blamed for keen expre&s;&s;ions, and violence of attack. But what is violence? Gen|tlemen of the Jury, I wi&s;h you to remember that what is violence without evidence, is truth with evidence. To call murder only a&s;&s;ault and battery would be a perver&s;ion of terms. To call malice, <HI>"fun"</HI>
<PB REF="037103_0044_100D32D4B556F010">
is as much &s;o. To &s;ay that the defendant had malice at heart when he u&s;ed the&s;e words, I therefore contend is evident without a doubt. Perhaps he u&s;ed this violence for another purpo&s;e. I could name a per&s;on who fell a victim to the malice indefatigably thrown at him through this very news paper. A man that &s;hould u&s;e &s;uch threats, could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to u&s;e his weapons but to the mo&s;t ba&s;e intenti|ons. And &s;hall a man of this ba&s;e di&s;po&s;ition teach Americans poli|tics? Shall this man deal about the Theorems and Aphori&s;ms of the medical art, and examine &s;y&s;tems of practice which he does not even pretend to under&s;tand? Can there be any ca&s;e of malice more expre&s;s than the&s;e words convey, or a better key found whereby to explain his writings? If expre&s;s declarations are ever admitted as proofs of the meaning of writings, (and certainly they are) there can be no doubt, here, of the exi&s;tence of the overt act in &s;ix or even eight in&s;tances: if it was po&s;&s;ible to give a more bright coloring to the tran&s;action, it was done by the &s;ub&s;equent publications in which the re&s;pect which every man owes to the Law, is highly violated.</P>
<P>We live in a land where the public transactions, and the officers of government are to be regulated by written rules; the&s;e are well known; the&s;e rules give to the people their duty of obedience to the Laws, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the higher authorities; it limits to every man in &s;ociety, how far he can go; it puni&s;hes tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion in the one cla&s;s, and violation in the other. If any individual, therefore, &s;hall dare tran&s;gre&s;s the&s;e laws, he &s;ubjects him&s;elf to the puni&s;hment they inflict. Therefore if any action is brought again&s;t a man, he is not thereby to be irritated! Upon the doctrine advanced by the honorable gentleman, as impri&s;onment would undoubtedly irritate any man, he would have a right to break pri&s;on, and murder any per&s;ons who &s;hould &s;tand in his way. An action would be a great irritation if ju&s;tice was le&s;s certain than we happily enjoy. Well, in&s;tead of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the operation of the law, what does he do? He continues to i&s;&s;ue out from his pre&s;s, new libels, calculated to increa&s;e his crime. The &s;uit was commenced in the beginning of October 1797, the whole of the pub|lications of the 5th, 7th and 20th of October were &s;ub&s;equent to the commencement of the &s;uit. Can there be a doubt, then, that the true cau&s;e of Mr. Cobbett's publications again&s;t Dr. Ru&s;h, originated, not with a view to improve the medical practices, but to di&s;grace and villi|fy the individual? Was Cobbett capable of judging of, or is he ac|quainted with the &s;tructure of the &s;y&s;tem, or its relative parts? Can he point out how the different treatments operate on that or any other di&s;ea&s;e? Can he &s;how how a certain mode of admini&s;tration would re|lieve one, while it would de&s;troy another? Was he &s;killed in the &s;ci|ence of anatomy or medicine? He does not pretend to be; Nay, he declared that he had no knowledge of it at all! He plainly confe&s;&s;ed that his e&s;&s;ays were not to inform the public mind, but to ridicule a certain &s;y&s;tem, for he &s;uppo&s;ed no-body would take notice of his writ|ings. Gentlemen, his hardihood has left every act and declaration upon which he is called to an&s;wer, or which proves the charge, with|out a &s;ingle equivoke on which the mind of any man can he&s;itate.</P>
<P>We do not contend that Dr. Ru&s;h has e&s;tabli&s;hed the true mode of
<PB REF="037103_0045_100D32D7269303E8">
practice: he thinks &s;o, and has given to the world his rea&s;ons for think|ing &s;o. But the ca&s;e does not re&s;t upon that point, it is all one to you whether his practice is right or wrong. Did Cobbett &s;ay that he knew a better mode? No. He endeavoured to ri&s;e a public laugh upon Dr. Ru&s;h, and put him forth in a mo&s;t degrading point of view, at a mo|ment when drooping humanity found no longer a ba&s;is in its own &s;ur|face; when the &s;tate of the city was enough to appal the &s;toute&s;t heart; when the confidence of men in general was placed on the advice of this man;&mdash;at that moment his reputation is pulled down; his mode of treatment, almo&s;t the only one then practi&s;ed, is de&s;troyed, and no effort is made to put another in its place! Dr. Ru&s;h does not pretend to &s;ay he is right; he thinks &s;o: But the &s;uperior genius of Cobbett <HI>does</HI> pre&s;ume to declare that he is wrong, and that he has killed his tens of thou&s;ands, though at the &s;ame time he declares he does not know whether the mode is right or wrong. The true &s;y&s;tem is not di&s;covered perhaps, nor ever might be: it might be like the dreadful earthquake that de&s;olates the world, no means ever found to arre&s;t its awful progre&s;s. It lies behind a veil through which the human &s;ight cannot, and never might penetrate. But our duty and our intere&s;t re|quires that, though we may never find the cau&s;e and cure, we &s;hould be indefatigable in our endeavors to do it: perhaps we may only find the mode of avoiding, by keeping out of its way. But is it probable we &s;hall ever be able to di&s;cover any means of prevention or cure, if the man who &s;tays making tho&s;e re&s;earches in times of imminent dan|ger, in addition to the natural alarm di&s;tracting his mind, which mind at that moment ought to be the mo&s;t &s;trong and penetrating, to &s;pread all its &s;ails and catch every, even the mo&s;t minute idea&mdash;How, I &s;ay can we expect the fever to be &s;ubdued, or kept away from our doors, if an individual &s;hall be &s;uffered to vend his malice on &s;uch a man at a period &s;o momentous? Suffer that with impunity, and no efforts will ever in future be made to appal this foul de&s;troyer, no man will fortify him|&s;elf for the illiberal attack. Gentlemen, con&s;ider this in a public, or in a private point of view, can there ever be an in&s;tance in which a plaintiff can come before you more entitled to your ju&s;t verdict, or a defendant with le&s;s claim to your verdict? Can a ca&s;e occur in which there is le&s;s to plead even for extenuation or excu&s;e or the crime? Gentlemen, reputation is &s;acred: an injury done to honor can &s;carcely be redre&s;&s;ed. How can youth acquire pro&s;perity or affluence, or age re&s;pectability, if that character, which is the foundation of &s;ucce&s;s in every profe&s;&s;ion, may be attacked with impunity? If upon property there is protection, but there is no protection for character, ju&s;tice is but par|tially admini&s;tered, and it is time now, if for the fir&s;t time, for an Ame|rican court of ju&s;tice to &s;how the world that character is property, and a property mo&s;t &s;acred. But I hope our courts of ju&s;tice have proved this whenever called upon &s;o to do. Who can &s;ay when a man is at|tacked in his reputation how numerous the chinks through which he may &s;u&s;tain injury? When this &s;haft is directed by malice and ridi|cule, how are we to depreciate the value of the injury done? How much might it not prevent a young man progre&s;&s;ing in bu&s;i|ne&s;s? And does the attack upon age le&s;&s;en the crime: a time when
<PB REF="037103_0046_100D32D953C1F008">
the experience is matured, and &s;tudied labors become eminently u&s;e|ful? Who knows but this &s;candal might have prevented thou&s;ands from applying to Dr. Ru&s;h for advice? We &s;ee the defendant &s;tand upon the high ground of boa&s;ting of his income, from the number of per&s;ons who bought and read his papers: we may thence conclude that this &s;lander extended very wide, and therefore to attempt at forming an e&s;timate of &s;pecial damages, would be fruitle&s;s. To prove this ne|gative, would be impo&s;&s;ible&punc; and therefore cannot be expected from us, for who would come to Dr. Ru&s;h and &s;ay, "I &s;hould have employed you, had not I read &s;uch a character of you; you have murdered thou&s;ands, and therefore I could not tru&s;t my life with you." To e&s;|timate damages mu&s;t be your province agreeable to circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the que&s;tion of damages often came before the courts in England, of which we have &s;ome &s;ome accounts in the books, and they are not always guided by pecuniary circum&s;tances, but more to enforce the law, and &s;how example. The law has there e&s;timated the fine for &s;educing a man's wife at ten thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. Here is no pe|cuniary injury &s;u&s;tained, but a very heavy fine laid; for often it may happen that a man has a bad wife, and her lo&s;s is a real profit to him, but this is not the mea&s;ure of the fine. Though le&s;s than that &s;um is u&s;ually laid, yet it is always exemplary. We find other ca&s;es menti|oned in the books. 2 Wil&s;on, 206. A journey man printer, in the office of the North Briton, was &s;eized for publi&s;hing No. 45 of that paper. He was &s;eized by an order of the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, and de|tained but &s;ix hours in cu&s;tody, and during that time treated with beef &s;takes and beer. On examining this in a court, to which it was re|ferred, the jury gave 300l. &s;terling damages. The fact was, not the pecuniary injury &s;u&s;tained by the man was con&s;idered, but the political con&s;equences&mdash;the liberty of the &s;ubject, and therefore the award re|ceived the approbation of the court. In 244 &s;ame book, 1000l. was awarded for a fal&s;e impri&s;onment of &s;ix days; al&s;o p 252 there is a ca&s;e of a&s;&s;ault and battery. In all the&s;e, the con&s;equences were con&s;idered. 3 Black&s;tone 126, notes there was 4000l. damages laid for a reflection on the cha&s;tity of a lady. The&s;e, gentlemen, are in&s;tances of exem|plary damages, and that is what we a&s;k for in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, your verdict. Doctor Ru&s;h has a wife and children arrived to ages capable of reading new&s;papers. Can any man &s;et by with patience, when he &s;ees his children crying, or his wife in tears in con&s;equence of the perpetual new&s;paper abu&s;e lavi&s;hed upon a tender hu&s;band and a loving father?&mdash;abu&s;e and reproach the mo&s;t heart-rending&mdash;no le&s;s than a murderer and a quack. Suppo&s;e your&s;elves for a moment in his &s;ituation, and &s;ay whether the mea&s;ure of this new&s;paper libelling ought to be confi|ned merely to the damages any individual could &s;u&s;tain from it, or whether it ought not to be made a public example of, on account of the principle. It is high time to re&s;cue the American character from the indifference which has too long prevailed among&s;t us, while we &s;ee the characters of our unoffending fellow-citizens con&s;igned to infamy. If it has hitherto been too much di&s;regarded, let not this be &s;o, for &s;urely it is time to puni&s;h crimes &s;o daring. This man has declared, that he would "per&s;ecute the defendant while living, and his memory
<PB REF="037103_0047_100D32DC18AEE0D0">
after his death." How can you check this vindictive &s;pirit, but by timely and exemplary puni&s;hment? Let him be taught that he has wantonly attacked, and that with cool deliberate malice, an unoffend|ing individual, and though he has removed him&s;elf out of the juri&s;dicti|on of this court, yet that he is a marked man, and that a re&s;pectable jury of Philadelphia have &s;tudied only principles of truth and ju&s;tice with impartiality. Let others be taught by his puni&s;hment to avoid his offence.</P>
<P>On the other hand, let not Dr. Ru&s;h be a marked man for defama|tion, and his name be remembered with &s;corn. Let it not be &s;aid to him "your character is &s;o infamous that no &s;lander can defame it." Nor let it be &s;aid that the immaculacy of character, again&s;t which he drew his &s;haft, was &s;uch as to excu&s;e or protect the in&s;olent offender from damages. If Cobbett has never injured the character of Dr. Ru&s;h, it is evident he has attempted to do it, and with his utmo&s;t efforts&mdash;but I think he has injured it. He certainly has wounded his feel|ings; he has hurt his health, and he has wounded him in his family. There cannot be a doubt but he has wounded his fame and reputation, and of cour&s;e his pecuniary intere&s;t. As I think you mu&s;t be of the &s;ame opinion with me in the&s;e particulars, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with confiding this ca&s;e to you, and as I am &s;ure nothing in the conduct of Dr. Ru&s;h has merited &s;uch infamous treatment, &s;o &s;ure am I you will do him &s;atisfactory ju&s;tice.</P>

<P>MR. TILGHMAN then addre&s;&s;ed the jury as follows:</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="address to the jury">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the Jury,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AGREE mo&s;t heartily with the council for the plaintiff that if you came into the bar, previous to being &s;worn with any prejudice what|ever, you ought to lay it perfectly a&s;ide, and con&s;ider the cau&s;e, which you are called to try, fairly between man and man: you &s;hould come with minds, in the language of the law "like blank paper," and re|ceive &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions only as law and evidence mu&s;t make.</P>
<P><PB REF="037103_0048_100D32DDD29B0408">
William Cobbett, my client, though an alien, is entitled all the ad|vantages which law and ju&s;tice can be&s;tow; and if he can &s;atisfy you that damages ought not to be recovered from an <HI>American</HI> &s;tanding in his place, no damages are to be given again&s;t him.&mdash;The plaintiff de|mands damages of my client for certain publications written by him, &s;aid to be libellous, on his profe&s;&s;ional reputation and character, to &s;upport which much has been &s;aid, but what de&s;erves particular notice is, that the plaintiff's council are <HI>tremblingly</HI> alive as to the character of Dr. Ru&s;h, while Mr. Cobbett is treated in terms utterly de&s;tructive of all character and reputation.</P>
<P>This was not what I expected in any ca&s;e whatever, and e&s;pecially from the gentlemen whence it came, whom I much re&s;pect. Gentle|men, you are not to pay regard to the contemptuous light in which the defendant is held by the plaintiff's council: you are not to mea&s;ure your verdict by their re&s;entment. One gentleman in order to &s;how the contemptuous light in which he holds Cobbett's opinion, has &s;aid he mu&s;t extend his duty beyond the ordinary limits. There can be no doubt but his zeal for his client induced him to go an extravagant length, or he would not have &s;tiled the defendant an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in (which he has twice done) and a noxious animal thrown up from the very dregs and &s;lime of ob&s;curity, a being which has no equal in &s;ociety, taking his tigers &s;trides to do mi&s;chief, and guilty of every &s;pecies of editorial pol|lution. Farther he condemns him for his <HI>litigious</HI> di&s;po&s;ition. Where, I a&s;k is the evidence of this di&s;po&s;ition? It is not before the court, nor has it appeared in his conduct, for he has not appealed to the law to redre&s;s his wrongs, but has u&s;ed another weapon, his pen. So far has my friend's zeal carried him, that he declared he could name an individu|al who was brought to the grave by this man's publications. The&s;e are vague and unproved a&s;&s;ertions: words which have no tendency but to inflame your minds, but I can only impute it to a zeal, the impropri|eties of which they know as well as I am able to inform them. May we not &s;uppo&s;e, after all this that Mr. Cobbett is a man more &s;inned again&s;t, than &s;inning? For while abu&s;e and dete&s;tation is his lot, Dr. Ru&s;h is daubed with prai&s;es &s;o lavi&s;hly that he mu&s;t almo&s;t have blu&s;hed to hear them. <HI>He</HI> was compared to Hypocrates, at Athens, having done &s;o much as to be entitled to public thanks, and yet the public are much divided as to the efficacy of his means of treatment, but more particularly &s;o as to his opinion of the origin of that fatal di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Further. The defendant is &s;aid to be an alien, and to owe no al|legiance to our government, and that his di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of public que&s;|tions &s;how the <HI>cloven-foot.</HI>&mdash;With re&s;pect to country, it is a principle that every <HI>alien</HI> who comes here, does owe allegiance&mdash;a temporary allegiance. So long as he &s;tays to receive the benefit of our laws, &s;o long he is an&s;werable to them, and is bound to re&s;pect them. I am far from contending that the defendant is immaculate or infallible, yet I mu&s;t &s;ay that he is not without &s;ome merit. He certainly did, (whatever his motive, whatever <HI>cloven-foot</HI> he might have had con|cealed) at a critical period, give a very &s;ea&s;onable and proper alarm to this country; an alarm which did much towards uniting our citi|zens in an attachment to pre&s;erve the honor of our country, and which
<PB REF="037103_0049_100D32DF636497B8">
tended much to re&s;cue us from European influences and attachment. As he began, &s;o he per&s;evered, and we are not without experiencing its good effects. Twice were bills of indictments &s;ent to grand juries, who proved his innocence of the charges exhibited again&s;t him by his opponents, by returning both of them <HI>ignoramus.</HI> However, all this is foreign to the que&s;tion at pre&s;ent, but the plaintiff's council having departed to <HI>derogate,</HI> we may be allowed to <HI>extenuate.</HI></P>
<P>I agree with Mr. Levy in his &s;tatement of the law; he certainly has &s;tated it with preci&s;ion and accuracy, and I mu&s;t do honor to his talents and candor. It formerly became my duty to &s;tate to this court, that every writing is on the face of it independant of collateral matter (which does not appear upon the face) either criminal or in|nocent.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, If it appears on the face of it to be innocent, or not libellous, &s;till it becomes criminal and libellous, if written with a particular <HI>in|tent</HI> of a <HI>criminal nature</HI>&mdash;then &s;uch intent mu&s;t be proved.</P>
<P>Secondly. If it appears, from the face of it to be criminal or libel|lous, there may, from the occa&s;ion, be ju&s;tification or excu&s;e.</P>
<P>In each ca&s;e, the criminality or innocence depends on collateral matter, not appearing on the face of the paper.</P>
<P>Lawful excu&s;e is ju&s;tifiable either in legal proceedings;&mdash;Repre&s;en|tations of an injury, &amp;c. even when the publication is in a new&s;paper: From a &s;en&s;e of duty, and not with a malicious <HI>intent:</HI>&mdash;Or in confi|dence, or with a view to reform and amend.</P>
<P>Generally. <HI>Publications must include</HI> MALICE <HI>or a</HI> CRIMINAL IN|TENT <HI>either expre&s;s or implied.</HI></P>
<P>I agree that if the jury &s;hould find the words them&s;elves to be li|bellous, then the plaintiff can recover damages, to prevent which, it would be his duty to &s;how that the intention was innocent.</P>
<P>A ca&s;e to exemplify the&s;e doctrines, is found in a Burrows, 807. "This was an action upon the ca&s;e for &s;peaking and publi&s;hing defa|matory, fal&s;e, malicious and libellous words, of and concerning the plain|tiff, Sir John A&s;tley."</P>
<P>The defendant applied to the plaintiff (a ju&s;tice of the peace) for a tavern licence, and was refu&s;ed: on which account, words were u&s;ed by the defendant, which were &s;uppo&s;ed libellous.</P>
<P>Lord Mansfield in the ca&s;e &s;poke thus, page 810:</P>
<P>"The charge again&s;t the defendant is made upon oath, and &s;up|ported by the affidavit of Sir John A&s;tley, and of the <HI>defendant in an|swer</HI> to his complaint: he mentioned the charge, and denies it with this conclu&s;ion, calling it "what Sir J. A. has &s;o FALSELY &s;worn again&s;t him."</P>
<P>"Now in every di&s;pute in a court of ju&s;tice upon oath, where <HI>one by affidavit charges a thing,</HI> and the other <HI>by affidavit</HI> denies it, the ca&s;e is, ordinarily, <HI>much the same</HI> (in effect) with the pre&s;ent, and each party might bring a civil action again&s;t the other; for it TOO often happens that the affidavit and evidence <HI>are</HI> in terms DIRECTLY OPPO|SITE each other.</P>
<P>"As to the rea&s;on of the thing, there can be no SCANDAL if the allegation is <HI>material,</HI> and if it is not, the court before whom the in|dignity
<PB REF="037103_0050_100D32E2326B0F08">
is <HI>immaterial</HI> &s;candal, may <HI>order satisfaction,</HI> and expunge it out of the <HI>record,</HI> if it be upon the <HI>record."</HI></P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee that thought the defendant was charged with &s;wearing that Sir John A&s;tley had "for&s;worn him&s;elf, and be (the defendant) would not do it for his whole e&s;tate," yet, although the expre&s;&s;ion "fal&s;ely" was rather <HI>too rough,</HI> it was not taken notice of.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t agree with the gentlemen, that had I been engaged in oppo|&s;ing Dr. Ru&s;h's opinions, I &s;hould have deemed it very improper to have u&s;ed &s;uch <HI>coarse</HI> expre&s;&s;ions. This brings me to a more clo&s;e and immediate view of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The fever of 1793 you well remember. Dr. Ru&s;h &s;taid in the city, no doubt, from a &s;en&s;e of duty: no doubt this operated &s;trongly with him, but it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that he had no &s;en&s;e of the profit: he expected to be paid for his labor, but notwith&s;tanding that, his exer|tions did him very great honor. I do not pretend to ju&s;tify &s;uch as attack on the &s;y&s;tem he practi&s;ed, but I do not think that condemning the <HI>system</HI> was libellous. I am &s;ure that when he came to take even 70 or 80 ounces of blood he was under the mo&s;t perfect conviction that it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ave the life of his patient, and that in all his practice he was actuated by the mo&s;t hone&s;t motives. But the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible, ingenuous and ardent man; the mo&s;t indefatigable in his exertions, is mo&s;t &s;trong|ly impre&s;&s;ed with new &s;y&s;tems and ideas, when they come plau&s;ibly &s;up|ported. Inqui&s;itive minds, like that of Dr. Ru&s;h, are not of a ca&s;t to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">oggle at adopting &s;trong mea&s;ures, e&s;pecially when convinced of their utility. To us it was new: the u&s;e of mercurial purges and bleeding, to &s;o va&s;t an amount, was entirely unheard of by us, and therefore it was no wonder that the practice &s;hould &s;pread an alarm of nearly as &s;e|rious a nature as the fever it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Doctor Ru&s;h was &s;o confident of the &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;y&s;tem, that in a let|ter addre&s;&s;ed to his fellow-citizens on the 12th of September, 1793, he a&s;&s;ures them <Q>there is no more danger from it, when the&s;e remedies have been u&s;ed in the early &s;tage, than there is from the mea&s;les or in|fluenza.</Q> But with all his &s;ucce&s;s, and though he &s;tood <HI>foremost, and nearly alone,</HI> as his coun&s;el &s;ay, there was a de&s;truction in that year of nearly 5000 per&s;ons. Notwith&s;tanding &s;o many peri&s;hed, though he &s;tood almo&s;t alone, and notwith&s;tanding the novelty of the remedies, and the great applications of bleeding and mercury, the pub|lic mind was extremely agitated and divided as to the efficacy of them. What was &s;till more extraordinary, there is no man who&s;e per&s;ua&s;ive &s;oftne&s;s and tenderne&s;s of manners is more likely to attract the confi|dence and acquie&s;cence of either pupils or patients than tho&s;e of Doc|tor Ru&s;h. But &s;tories of bleeding and purging were much exaggera|ted in the relation, &s;o as to harra&s;s the public mind extremely. Indeed the phy&s;icians them&s;elves were much divided, and even parties were formed to &s;upport the different &s;y&s;tems. The event of this was a creation of animo&s;ity and new&s;paper contention. Of cour&s;e this increa&s;ed the public alarm, and dreadful was our &s;ituation. One &s;et of Doctors con|tended this was the true mode, and the other another. In this &s;tate of uncertainty and indeci&s;ion things remained until the fever again unhap|pily broke out in 1797, and with it the Doctors' quarrels, on account of
<PB REF="037103_0051_100D32E4F4AFDE88">
which numerous publications i&s;&s;ue forth. Nor even were the re&s;pecta|ble learned in&s;titutions exempt: the College of Phy&s;icians and the Medical Academy. I believe the difference between tho&s;e bodies &s;till exi&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The difference was explained to exist at present only as to the ori|gin, whether by importation or of domestic source. With respect to treatment they now both agree with the system of Dr. Rush.</HI></NOTE> Doctor Ru&s;h &s;taid again, and much to his honor. It is &s;aid that the great point for which he &s;taid was fru&s;trated.</P>
<P>Gentlemen I a&s;k by whom it was fru&s;trated? Can it be believed that it was fru&s;trated by Cobbett? Who&s;e oppo&s;ition to Dr. Ru&s;h was mo&s;t &s;erious, that of Cobbett, or that of the Doctors? As you are not &s;ure it was by Cobbett, but mu&s;t have good ground for believing the other more <HI>potent,</HI> there can be no doubt where his di&s;appointment ori|ginated. Or, I would a&s;k, was it fru&s;trated at all? No doubt the Doctor did much good by &s;taying, and as the di&s;pute was &s;o undecid|ed, I do not believe that any per&s;on would be prevented from apply|ing to Doctor Ru&s;h for a&s;&s;i&s;tance on account of Cobbett's publicati|ons.</P>
<P>In September 1797, out comes Cobbett's fir&s;t publication. I do not mean to vindicate the manner of the attack, but my client has been charged with calling the defendant a <HI>murderer.</HI> Now, Gentlemen, I appeal to your con&s;ciences, can any man who reads the publication look upon it as any thing like <HI>a serious charge</HI> again&s;t Dr. Ru&s;h as a <HI>murderer?</HI> I am very &s;ure that you will all allow with me that he meant no more than a ludicrous attack upon the &s;y&s;tem of which he certain|ly was the head.</P>
<P>What is murder? It is to kill a man by <HI>malice prepense.</HI> It can|not be &s;uppo&s;ed that the defendant had an idea of &s;o &s;erious a charge. There were numerous &s;kirmi&s;hes among the Doctors, and he &s;kirmi&s;h|ed among the re&s;t with the only weapon he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: <HI>Ridicule.</HI> In this &s;en&s;e "ridicule is &s;urely the te&s;t of truth," however the ingenuous gentleman may have u&s;ed it. I a&s;k, then, did this proceed from <HI>cool de|liberate malice,</HI> or was it ridiculing a &s;y&s;tem which he &s;uppo&s;ed to be ill founded? If he had meant that Doctor Ru&s;h went on murderou&s;ly rejoicing at the direful effects of his &s;y&s;tem, it &s;urely would have been a libel of the mo&s;t egregrious nature, but the idea cannot be proved, even by the greate&s;t ingenuity. That William Cobbet had a right to attack that &s;y&s;tem or any other we contend is indubitable, however &s;mall the &s;take he had among us, or however &s;hort his intended &s;tay, if he u&s;ed no improper words in making that attack. I allow, with Mr. Levy, that it is incumbent on the Defendant, when brought into the court, to prove that he did not u&s;e the words with an evil intention; with re&s;pect to this, we contend that if he exerci&s;ed his abilities with a view to the public &s;afety, he exerci&s;ed them not only innocently but laudably. I &s;ubmit to you that the publications include no de&s;ign to render Dr. Ru&s;h, in his per&s;on odious, or to injure him in his bu&s;ine&s;s. However free he has been in his attack upon Dr. Tilton, or any other per&s;on, he has here only attacked <HI>mercury</HI> and <HI>blood letting.</HI> If he ever di&s;approved of the private character of the defendant, he has not
<PB REF="037103_0052_100D32E7334B39C0">
exemplified it: the phy&s;icians were the main battle, and great was the &s;hock, but Cobbett was a mere &s;kirmi&s;her, on the practice and not on the man.</P>
<P>I &s;peak in reference to the publications mentioned in the declaration, for though the plaintiff's council have a right to read any other pub|lications, it is only to &s;hew the <HI>quo animo,</HI> or de&s;ign with which the others were written.</P>
<P>But the malice of this man is &s;aid to be <HI>deep, antecedent, concomit|ant and subsequent.</HI>&mdash;All this I deny. The te&s;timony of Dr. Dewees is called to prove that it was <HI>antecedent</HI>&mdash;Sometime in 1796, Doctor Ru&s;h delivered, on occa&s;ion of the departure of Dr. Rittenhou&s;e from this life, an <HI>elegant eulogium</HI>&mdash;too <HI>elegant</HI> to be forgotten.</P>
<P>However, there was &s;ome little of that &s;ort of <HI>spice</HI> in it which was not plea&s;ing to Mr. Peter Porcupine. It was <HI>too republican</HI> for his ta&s;te. I do not know what Dr. Ru&s;h's political &s;entiments are, but if they are of one &s;ort, I &s;hould di&s;like them as much as Cobbett. If of another &s;ort, I &s;hould approve of it, and perhaps not think it <HI>too republican.</HI> But that is to be no mea&s;ure for him; he had a right to attack them. In a conver&s;ation about the merits of that eulogium, he &s;ays "Damn him, I will attack him for it." This, to be &s;ure is very illiberal, but he did not &s;ay in what way he would attack him, on that he meant more than to attack him as a political man. There is no evidence of any private malice that <HI>Peter</HI> had in his heart, nor can it be contended that this eulogium was the ground of his attacks, mentioned in the declaration, for had it been &s;o it would not have re&s;ted &s;o long in &s;ilence as from January 'till September. No, from the repre&s;entation of gentlemen them&s;elves, he was of too combu&s;tible a matter to keep it &s;o long. If it made any impre&s;&s;ion at all, it was not &s;olid, for if it had, I think it would have been out of the power of <HI>bleeding and drastic purges</HI> to do it away. He was angry, and expre&s;&s;ed his anger in a very coar&s;e way. Well.&mdash;In September came the attack. Is into the <HI>man</HI> or the <HI>system?</HI> It has appeared that Dr. Dewees practi&s;ed upon the &s;y&s;tem of Dr. Ru&s;h, and yet he attended Cobbett's family. This is brought to prove the man, and not the &s;y&s;tem was the object of attack! I a&s;k whether, if there had come an alarm of the fever du|ring Dr. Dewees's attendance upon Mr. Cobbett's family, he would have been &s;uffered to u&s;e Dr. Ru&s;h's &s;y&s;tem? If that had been done, then indeed there would have been rea&s;on to conclude <HI>the man</HI> was attacked. I cannot but con&s;ider this circum&s;tance re&s;pecting the Eu|logium to be an attempt to draw the attention of the Jury from the real merits of the ca&s;e, tending to e&s;tabli&s;h a belief that there was deep &s;ettled malice, which he kept in his brea&s;t during that period, growing deeper and &s;tronger in proportion to the time it exi&s;ted in the mind, and therefore, gentlemen, you are earne&s;tly in&s;tructed to give verdict for the plaintiff. On the &s;ame account al&s;o, the que&s;tion is a&s;ked why Cobbett &s;hould wi&s;h a reform in medicine? and it has even been hinted that he might wi&s;h to leave the di&s;ea&s;e without a cure, and might not be di&s;plea&s;ed with the misfortunes of Philadelphia, becau&s;e it would dimini&s;h the commerce, and probably &s;erve his own country. This &s;urely is too much to &s;ay of any man, but tho'
<PB REF="037103_0053_100D32E9AE32EB68">
&s;erious, I have no doubt you will put the whole of the&s;e <HI>insinuations</HI> upon a candid footing, and decide only upon <HI>facts.</HI> As to his wi&s;hing to leave the di&s;ea&s;e without a cure, it is ab&s;urd, for he &s;tayed in Phila|delphia during the fever of '97, in which &s;ituation, he &s;ubjected him|&s;elf to be the fir&s;t victim of his ownenvy! This is what I think you will &s;carcely believe.</P>
<P>In the evidence of Dr. Mea&s;e it appears that Cobbett made u&s;e of a very intemperate expre&s;&s;ion, but having been &s;ued, he might be idle enough, knowing him&s;elf to be ma&s;ter of a very bitter weapon the pen&mdash;he might think he could thereby induce Doctor Ru&s;h to withdraw his action. If &s;o, he was guilty of a very great mi&s;conclu&s;ion. He was very wrong, but I rather think it mu&s;t have been the effect of ha&s;te, without any evil intention. Gentlemen, upon your oath, try if you can couple the&s;e words with tho&s;e &s;poken to Doctor Dewees! I think you cannot.</P>
<P>As to the words to Mr. Cox, I am of the &s;ame opinion with Mr. Harper: that he would "not have written again&s;t the &s;y&s;tem, if Dr. Ru&s;h had not been the author of it." It was paying a very great compliment to Doctor Ru&s;h. This appears to have taken place about the time the &s;uit was commenced, and to have been pre&s;&s;ed upon him by Doctor Cox. Doctor Cox him&s;elf &s;eems to believe it to be an attack upon the &s;y&s;tem. His view was no doubt to pre&s;erve the life, and health of his fellow creatures, many of whom, in his opinion, &s;uffered from this mode treatment, and therefore he did his utmo&s;t to point out the danger.</P>
<P>Upon this part I &s;hall not remain longer, &s;ince I think neither "keen, private, nor per&s;onal malice," as has been pretended, can be proved. Gentlemen view the whole together as Mr. Levy &s;aid, and if you &s;ee all this "fixed, keen, private, per&s;onal malice" again&s;t Doctor Ru&s;h, then you mu&s;t give verdict for, the plaintiff. But I con&s;ider that the great alarm which exi&s;ted in the public mind at that time, many deeming the practice in que&s;tion to be no le&s;s than poi&s;on, and death&mdash;If &s;uch was the alarm, and &s;uch the apprehen&s;ion, for which I appeal to your recollections&mdash;then, I &s;ay it was not improper to point the &s;haft of ridicule again&s;t the &s;y&s;tem &s;o replete with danger.</P>
<P>But, Gentlemen, &s;uppo&s;e you &s;hould be of opinion that the Plan|tiff has been injured by tho&s;e publications, and damages ought to be awarded, the next que&s;tion that occurs to you is <HI>what ought those damages to be?</HI> It has been a que&s;tion a&s;ked by the plantiff's coun|&s;el "Who knows how many have been prevented from applying to Dr. Ru&s;h"? How a negative can be proved I cannot conceive; neither he nor I can tell <HI>who has been prevented;</HI> that is entirely in the dark. Doctor Ru&s;h's Coun&s;el, when they drew up the declaration drew it upon &s;pecial damages. Near the conclu&s;ion of the declaration are the&s;e words! <HI>(The said Benjamin")</HI> is al&s;o thereby greatly pre|judiced in his bu&s;ine&s;s practice and profe&s;&s;ion of Phy&s;ician, and prac|titioner as afore&s;aid, <HI>many persons have been induced to withdraw their confidence from the said Benjamin, as Physician, aforesaid, and the following persons, who were previously accustomed to employ the said Banjamin a Physician as aforesaid to wit:</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="037103_0054_100D32ED122D9468">
"The <HI>mountains</HI> are in labour, and a rediculous <HI>mouse</HI> creeps forth"!!</P>
<P>Where, then, are the in&s;tances in which Doctor Ru&s;h has received damages? Wherein is he injured?&mdash;all the indu&s;try of tho&s;e Gentle|men could not find out &s;pecial damages, or a cu&s;tomer withdrawn. It appears that &s;uch was Dr. Ru&s;h's reputation, that he is not in|jured. You know what this reputation and character is at pre&s;ent. I do not mean by this that, if you di&s;cover the expre&s;&s;ions to have proceeded from <HI>malice</HI> you are to give any damages; but you mu&s;t be guided by the injury &s;u&s;tained in a great manner. Has not Doctor Ru&s;h from 1793 to 1797 and from 1797 to 1799 been in as great bu&s;ine&s;s as he could do?</P>
<P>Plaintiff's Coun&s;el.&mdash;We &s;ay No.&mdash;We can prove from his books that his bu&s;ine&s;s has materially le&s;&s;ened &s;ince this new&s;paper attack commenced on him.</P>
<P>Mr. TIGHLMAN.&mdash;It is &s;aid that Mr. Cobbett violated the law by &s;ub&s;equent publications. I grant that, from the moment the &s;uit was commenced he has done wrong in doing or &s;aying any thing until the trial. So far he was liable to puni&s;hment, but not in this way, nor at this time. He was liable for contempt of Court, and if Dr. Ru&s;h had complained, he could have been committed for that contempt. The moment a &s;uit takes place the law &s;ays the parties ought both to be &s;ilent, <HI>because every thing ought to come be|fore a Jury,</HI> who &s;hall not have their pa&s;&s;ions rai&s;ed, or be prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed in favor of either party. Therefore, this does not prove that he &s;hall recover aggravated damages.</P>
<P>One of the Coun&s;el has &s;uppo&s;ed libels to be the &s;ources of nume|rous evils, and laid down the po&s;ition that to &s;ecure good govern|ment you mu&s;t puni&s;h libels &s;everely; thus &s;evere puni&s;hment would be the be&s;t criterion of a good government? I tru&s;t this will never be a law principle; that no per&s;on will ever be puni&s;hed, not even an <HI>alien,</HI> to prove how good the government is. How fatal would be the admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice if this was law! To what &s;evere ties would it not lead!</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that you are the uncontrolled Judges of dama|ges. In matters of debt or property, there can be no difficulty as to the e&s;timate of damages proper, and then the Court will not &s;uffer what is ea&s;ily perceivable to be an extreme award. But, in civil &s;uits, as in an action for Slander, when damages are uncertain, and difficult, the a&s;certainment of tho&s;e damages are more pecu|liarly the province of the Jury, though in that they are not perfectly uncontrolled; but the Court will not grant a new trial, unle&s;s the damages given are "outrageous;" unle&s;s, "at the fir&s;t blu&s;h, all mankind would revolt again&s;t it." Farther, they are not uncon|trolled, becau&s;e they are to con&s;ider the Plaintiff's &s;uffering, and the Defendant's ability to pay. Would you give again&s;t William Cobbett the &s;ame damages as again&s;t a man with an hundred times the property? Surely not. You mu&s;t con&s;ider the circum&s;tances of the man. There has been no evidence adduced in re&s;pect to the circum&s;tances of the defendant, but it is a rule in Courts to fine the party <HI>not to his ruin.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="037103_0055_100D32EEA179C360">
The Coun&s;el has told you, that if a Phy&s;ician's character is &s;u&s;|pected, it is ruined. Then may I &s;ay that Dr. Ru&s;h's is not only not ruined, but in as high credit and reputation as can attend a phy&s;ician, and therefore not even &s;u&s;pected, and if not &s;u&s;pected, he is not injured.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that if damages were not given &s;ufficiently high, per&s;ons would take the law into their own hands, and the Jury mu&s;t take the con&s;equences, therefore you mu&s;t give high damages to avoid being implicated your&s;elves! Gentlemen, pay regard only to ju&s;tice, and leave the con&s;equences; mea&s;ure the degree of inju|ry received on the one hand, and the ability to pay on the other, and thus e&s;timate your damages. Remember, that although the doctor may have a right to damages, his reputation will not in the lea&s;t be affected by your not giving him <HI>large</HI> damages.</P>
<P>I pa&s;s by the gentleman's appeal to the ju&s;t heavens, and his pi|teous &s;cene of crying children and a weeping wife, becau&s;e I know you can only e&s;timate this as an appeal to your pa&s;&s;ions. I &s;hall, therefore, only proceed to examine the ca&s;es referred to you.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e in 2 Wil&s;on 206 was a flagrant violation of the liberty of the &s;ubject, by unju&s;t impri&s;onment, and 300&pound; was not too high an award, though the impri&s;onment was &s;hort, and the treatment good. The Secretary of State was there exerci&s;ing arbitrary power by taking the man up upon a general warrant. Thus it &s;truck the jury. <Q>To enter a man's hou&s;e by virtue of a namele&s;s warrant is wor&s;e than the Spani&s;h inqui&s;ition: a daring attack;&mdash;an attempt to violate <HI>magna charta,</HI></Q> &s;aid Lord Campden.&mdash;A more di&s;&s;imi|lar ca&s;e to the pre&s;ent cannot po&s;&s;ibly be cited.</P>
<P>The other ca&s;e p. 244 of the &s;ame book is al&s;o on a general war|rant. The ca&s;e 252 called the turtle ca&s;e, was an unprovoked and unrea&s;onable a&s;&s;ault and battery, where the damages ought to be great, but the defendant was able to pay.</P>
<P>It is di&s;agreeable for me to make any ob&s;ervations on the letter which I was impelled by my duty to read at the commencement of my defence. You will collect from that letter a few ideas which I think may prove that the Doctor has not only been intemperately, but uncommonly &s;evere upon every one who had the misfortune to differ from him in practice. He has &s;aid "As well might there be two &s;uns or two moons, as to &s;uppo&s;e that two &s;orts of lever prevailed in that year," although &s;o many different &s;ymptoms made their appear|ance. His treatment of the Health Laws is extremely &s;evere, he does not only &s;peak again&s;t the phy&s;icians, but again&s;t the Legi&s;lature it|&s;elf. One &s;olitary in&s;tance of good might happen therefrom, but upon the whole he declares the laws very de&s;tructive. Though he does not handle the objects of his attack in &s;trains &s;o &s;trong as Cobbett does, yet he is extremely &s;evere. If he &s;uffers him&s;elf to be led to &s;uch great lengths in his attacks, upon his brethren, the Phy&s;icians, and upon the Legi&s;lature it&s;elf, I tru&s;t you will not con&s;ider him entitled to as great damages as though he had been &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, with the&s;e remarks, I leave the cau&s;e to your deci&s;ion, and repeat that I hope, if you &s;hould con&s;ider the plantiff de&s;erving of <HI>damages,</HI> you will con&s;ider how little injury he has &s;u&s;tained, and what
<PB REF="037103_0056_100D32F04F4F0D58">
are the defendant's circum&s;tances; but I tru&s;t you will believe, with me, that none of the&s;e publications flowed from malice, and that no|thing in them was meant to injure the Doctor as a man or as a Phy&s;i|cian, but to attack his &s;y&s;tem. If the&s;e are your opinions, you mu&s;t give a verdict for the defendant.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the Jury,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Coun&s;el for the Defendant have dwelt much on an ob&s;ervati|on which is very trite, but certainly very true; that the under&s;tanding is not to be tru&s;ted when the pa&s;&s;ions are engaged.</P>
<P>I will therefore endeavor at pre&s;ent, to &s;uppre&s;s my feelings;&mdash;the hone&s;t indignation which, in &s;pite of my efforts is ready to bur&s;t forth; and examine calmly the facts; I will approach your pa&s;&s;ions through the fair and hone&s;t medium of <HI>your understandings,</HI> and if I &s;ucceed, as I think I &s;hall, in &s;hewing that every <HI>tittle</HI> of our declaration is &s;upported by the cleare&s;t proofs, then I contend that your &s;en&s;ibility ought to be excited. For, give me leave to &s;ay that any man who can believe the te&s;timony we have produced; he who reflects on the particulars &s;tated, with a full conviction of their truth, and then remains wholly unmoved, mu&s;t be callous, and lo&s;t to every hone&s;t &s;en|timent of humanity.</P>
<P>What, Gentlemen, is the nature of our complaint? Is it of a com|mon, or of a peculiarly aggravated nature? Wearing him&s;elf out in the duties of his profe&s;&s;ion, the Plantiff, like a &s;aving <HI>Angel,</HI> arre&s;ted the arms of Death, expo&s;ing him&s;elf, when it was difficult which mo&s;t to admire, the profundity of his profe&s;&s;ional &s;kill, or the vigor and be|nevolence of his mind, that bore him up again&s;t the dread of infectious &s;cenes, which the &s;toute&s;t Hero could not have approached without trembling. While thus employed, the foul attack is made; he is an|nounced to the world as a "Quack&mdash;Empyric&mdash;Potent Quack." and "Grand Empyric," and the confidence of his Patients is withdrawn; he is repre&s;ented as either by de&s;ign or ignorance, de&s;troying "thou|&s;ands and tens of thou&s;ands" of his fellow citizens. He is repre&s;ented by this printer, as the exterminating Angel, going through the &s;treets and heaping dead bodies on each other, and practi&s;ing little arts and tricks to &s;upport his reputation, which would di&s;grace even a moute|bank.</P>

You will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve that in this in&s;tance we do not pur&s;ue a <HI>Journeyman</HI> Printer, as in the ca&s;e of Gen. Hamilton at N. York. There was &s;ome pre|tence urged for pity; but here we bring before you the Printer and Editor; not the printer only, who may &s;uffer an innocent victim, from the concealed name of his corre&s;pondent, whom a &s;en&s;e of honor may induce him to &s;ecrete, but the editor him&s;elf, who made it his con&s;tant practice to <HI>vilify</HI> and traduce the unoffending, and in the&s;e in&s;tances, the man who&s;e upright conduct, and u&s;eful labors would have been &s;uppo&s;ed to remove him far even from <HI>suspicion</HI> of ill fame.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of re&s;orting to an Indictment where Dr. Ru&s;h might be a witne&s;s, we come fairly into the field with an action which puts the parties upon an equal footing. The que&s;tion is not now whether the truth may or may not be given in evidence, but we invite the conflict If William Cobbet can &s;ub&s;tantiate any thing again&s;t Dr. Ru&s;h, he may now come and do it; or he may come and ju&s;tify him&s;elf if he can, but <HI>that</HI> he pretends not to do; the publications are not de|nied, although loaded with &s;uch atrocious <HI>villainy.</HI></P>
<P>The defendant had his choice to <HI>take</HI> one of &s;everal cour&s;es; he might &s;ay all the&s;e things were true, and pretend to &s;ub&s;tantiate them, or he might &s;ay he did not mean it as it has been con&s;trued; or he might &s;ay "I have been very ra&s;h and unguarded in my treatment of an in|jured man, and upon reflection, I am at war with my&s;elf as much as you can be with me." But what has he done? He has undertaken to ju&s;tify him&s;elf in the acts. I appeal to your honors whether it has not always been the practice in Penn&s;ylvania, when a defendant has not endeavored to prove his di&s;avowal, but per&s;i&s;ted in a ju&s;tificati|on of him&s;elf, and aggravation of his offence&mdash;whether in &s;uch a ca&s;e, the guilt appearing plain, the jury does not always give <HI>exemplary</HI> da|mages? One of his Coun&s;el &s;peaks of Dr. Ru&s;h as all but &s;uper-natu|ral&mdash;another <HI>hints</HI> and in&s;inuates, and damns by feint prai&s;e; and a

third acknowledges that the publications contain many untruths; that they are <HI>"Stuff, Nonsense and Ribaldry;"</HI> but he wi&s;hes to ea&s;e his client from the <HI>legal</HI> con&s;equences. If he contends that we do not put the right meaning upon his publications, then it mu&s;t at la&s;t be left for us to under&s;tand their true meaning, except he can convince us otherwi&s;e. I therefore a&s;k you Gentlemen, where there is any thing to <HI>justify</HI> or <HI>palliate</HI> or whether they do not come up to the very <HI>climax</HI> of abu&s;e and vulgarity, more than I hope will ever appear again, ei|ther in this, or any other country.</P>
<P>A perfectly accurate idea of the&s;e publications, then, becomes in|di&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary; and here, &s;o far, I will accede to the wi&s;hes ex|pre&s;&s;ed by my learned opponents. I will not wander from the publi|cations; they &s;hall form my text, and I will keep clo&s;e to it.</P>
<P>I will analize it; I will di&s;&s;ect it; I will contemplate it in different points of view, and rea&s;on upon the&s;e points; I will follow the de|fendant through all his windings, and at every turn prove malice upon him. The&s;e publications furni&s;h an exhau&s;tle&s;s fund of ob&s;ervation, and &s;hould I &s;peak a week there would yet remain more to be &s;aid.</P>
<P>Two po&s;itions &s;tated by the fir&s;t Coun&s;el who &s;poke for the defend|ant mu&s;t be kept con&s;tantly in view through this cau&s;e; That Doctor Ru&s;h di&s;pen&s;ed his medicines, and admini&s;tered the healing art to the be&s;t of his great abilities, and without even &s;u&s;picion as to his integri|ty.&mdash;That the defence re&s;ts upon this ground that the defendant has made a public di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of a que&s;tion of general concern, free from per&s;onal abu&s;e of the plaintiff's moral or profe&s;&s;ional character. The gentleman then, as if apprehen&s;ive that his conce&s;&s;ions might furni&s;h a weapon again&s;t him&s;elf, immediately adds that a little acrimony mixed with the di&s;qui&s;itions does not render it &s;candal, and that <HI>acrimony</HI> exi&s;ted even among the Phy&s;icians them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Much depends upon what name we give a thing. What the gen|tlemen calls <HI>acrimony,</HI> I call <HI>slander</HI> and per&s;onal abu&s;e, with a deli|berate de&s;ign of demoli&s;hing the reputation of Dr. Ru&s;h.&mdash;God's Pro|vidence is by &s;ome called <HI>a lucky hit,</HI> Piety <HI>superstition,</HI> Seduction and Debauchery <HI>gallantry,</HI> violence <HI>spirit,</HI> and the whole &s;tore-hou&s;e of <HI>defamation,</HI> here ran&s;acked for epithets of reproach, is denominated <HI>Acrimony!</HI> We may call any thing by a <HI>soft</HI> name, but that does not alter the nature of the thing. The Coun&s;el in admitting the eminence in point of &s;kill, and the purity of Heart of the Plaintiff, takes from the defendant all po&s;&s;ibility of defence in attempting to lay its founda|tion. If Doctor Ru&s;h is thus de&s;ervedly eminent, and if there can be no &s;u&s;picion of his integrity, and he has acted &s;o uprightly in his at|tendance upon a di&s;ea&s;e, the mo&s;t fatal that ever Providence inflicted upon a guilty world, with what temper ought a man to come forward and &s;peak of him? Certainly it ought to be with much deference and re&s;pect to his character and conduct. But even &s;uppo&s;ing he did fall into an error, &s;hall he be held up to the world as the mo&s;t remor&s;ele&s;s of murderers?</P>
<P>We are told by the learned coun&s;el on the other &s;ide that <HI>"Ridicule</HI> is the te&s;t of <HI>truth."</HI> I deny the po&s;ition. This was the favorite po|&s;ition of that Arch Dei&s;t Shafte&s;bury&mdash;driven from the field of <HI>Rea|son</HI>
<PB REF="037103_0059_100D32F82BDD2FE0">
and <HI>Argument,</HI> this was his only &s;ubterfuge in his attacks on Chri&s;tianity. It is po&s;&s;ible, to be &s;ure, to render <HI>truth</HI> a <HI>ridicule;</HI> in the &s;ame manner you may dre&s;s a wi&s;e man in a fool's cap. This maxim, &s;o long ago exploded by the greater part of mankind, mu&s;t now be revived&mdash;its revival is worthy of the cau&s;e of the defendant!&mdash;The very go&s;pel of Heaven, by di&s;torting its &s;en&s;e, and by partial re|pre&s;entations, may be made to appear ridiculous: But this is no te&s;t of its intrin&s;ic merits.</P>
<P>The law, however, has re&s;olved this que&s;tion: <HI>"You shall not, by a libel, or by writing, set a man in a ridiculous light"</HI>&mdash;the rea&s;on forms a part of the rule&mdash;it goes on, <HI>"and thereby diminish his reputation."</HI> 3 Black&s;tone 125. The &s;ame doctrine is exemplified in the other books, and the law &s;ays expre&s;sly, that <HI>"you shall not make a repre|sentation even to impute to a man</HI> BOASTING <HI>and</HI> VAIN GLORY."&mdash;This is a principle laid down in Hawkins. Slander endeavors to creep behind every covert battery, and a&s;&s;umes every form&mdash;&s;ometimes it even pretends to prai&s;e and commend a man, for the very purpo&s;e of in|troducing its venom. Gentlemen, the law &s;ays this is a libel; judges have &s;aid &s;o throughout the annals of every court, and &s;hall <HI>we</HI> and <HI>juries</HI> affect not to under&s;tand what every illiterate man under&s;tands to be libellous?</P>
<P>The principle of innocence in the&s;e publications, on account of their pretended di&s;qui&s;itions on the yellow fever, is not ju&s;t; but if it was e&s;tabli&s;hed, it would not help the defendant. What di&s;cu&s;&s;ion on the &s;y&s;tem, or what re&s;pecting the treatment, or what that tends to &s;hew that &s;y&s;tem to be <HI>ridiculous,</HI> do you find in the&s;e publications? I will defy the coun&s;el to point out a &s;ingle &s;yllable either as to the <HI>nature, origin or treatment</HI> of the yellow fever; not a word even to ridicule the po&s;itions laid down!</P>
<P>Does the ridicule appear to be aimed at the <HI>system</HI> or the profe&s;&s;ion|al <HI>reputation</HI> and character of the phy&s;ician! that, &s;ays Mr. Harper, is the que&s;tion. You may not, &s;ays he, combat the &s;y&s;tem by de&s;troy|ing the reputation of the practitioner.&mdash;So far we agree. To this te&s;t, thus furni&s;hed by the opponents coun&s;el I appeal&mdash;If the defendant did enter into the nature and application of the remedies, I am quite un|informed; but I think he did not. Let us &s;ee how he attacked the &s;y&s;tem and not the man, as is pretended. The fir&s;t publication intro|duced begins with two lines, wherein it is repre&s;ented that Dr. Ru&s;h is one <HI>quack</HI> holding conver&s;ation with another. Now, gentlemen, I would &s;ubmit one que&s;tion to your under&s;tanding:&mdash;is it the &s;y&s;tem that he calls a <HI>Potent Quack,</HI> or is it Dr. Ru&s;h? Is it the &s;y&s;tem that he has &s;tigmatized with the degrading epithet of <HI>Don Sangrado,</HI> or is it Dr. Ru&s;h per&s;onally?</P>
<P>Who was this Don Sangrado?&mdash;Mr. Harper has told you in part&mdash;<HI>A Quack damned to everlasting fame,</HI> in the novel of Gil Blas.&mdash;What could be the meaning when it was applied to Dr. Ru&s;h? What would you think of it, if you were to be called Mo&s;es Ca&s;tello?&mdash;a man who practi&s;ing merchandize, was arraigned and convicted of a <HI>fraud</HI> in this court. Would you put up with the in&s;ult, merely becau&s;e the per&s;on who called you &s;o, &s;hould &s;ay "I was only di&s;cu&s;&s;ing a que&s;tion of
<PB REF="037103_0060_100D32FA9F441EB0">
commerce?" If this was to be done in a public paper, would you treat it with &s;ilent contempt?</P>
<P>William Cobbett, at the time he made the&s;e publications, whatever defence he has now &s;et up to the contrary, did not mean to adopt the &s;ubterfuge which is now u&s;ed. He meant to put it beyond all kind of doubt who he meant; for le&s;t <HI>all these names</HI> &s;hould not be perfectly under&s;tood; as if &s;ome per&s;ons would &s;till be at a lo&s;s to know who he meant that <HI>dishonored his profession, and was not worthy the public con|fidence;</HI> he proceeds on to the introduction of Spil&s;bury's adverti&s;e|ment, which pretends with the &s;ame remedy to cure all manner of di&s;|ea&s;es, however different their nature, calling it fir&s;t, "a puff equal to Dr. Ru&s;h's," and concluding "there, beat that if you can." Thus, you &s;ee, this <HI>Quack,</HI> this ridiculous <HI>Empyric</HI> is, for&s;ooth, put upon the &s;ame footing with Dr. Ru&s;h!&mdash;It would in&s;ult your under&s;tandings to in&s;inuate that this was not to degrade Dr. Ru&s;h. Nay, he expre&s;sly &s;ays in one of his public papers that <HI>he would demolish the fortress of his reputation.</HI></P>
<P>Now, gentlemen, I a&s;k you whether it is the &s;y&s;tem or the man at|tacked? he loads the Dr. with all kinds of epithets which malice and ill nature could po&s;&s;ibly invent; holding him up as a vain puffer; when the language of the law is expre&s;s that "you may not impute to a man vain boa&s;ting." A child could not be at a lo&s;s to under&s;tand the meaning of the&s;e attacks.&mdash;The idea of attacking the &s;y&s;tem was an after thought; it originated in the ingenuity of the coun&s;el; be|cau&s;e the defendant has never once &s;aid that he under&s;tood it, or was able to produce an argument again&s;t it. It was not the &s;y&s;tem which he attacked, when he a&s;cribed to Dr. Ru&s;h the vain boa&s;ting practice of courting and making encomiums upon him&s;elf, and rai&s;ing a reputa|tion which he did not de&s;erve, by writing letters and an&s;wering them him&s;elf, &amp;c.</P>
<P>What would you think of a man who would interfere in the deci&s;i|on of a cau&s;e, in which property to the amount of millions was depend|ing, or in a ca&s;e of <HI>life</HI> and <HI>death,</HI> that would tell you at the &s;ame time, he neither under&s;tood the cau&s;e, nor had &s;tudied the merits of it, nor the guilt or innocence of the accu&s;ed, and afterwards &s;ay he was only in je&s;t, he was only laughing; would you not declare lie was like the man in holy writ, who "threw firebrands, arrows and death, and &s;aid, <HI>I am only in sport?"</HI></P>
<P>Gentlemen, the que&s;tions which have been made, and which the learned coun&s;el have exerted them&s;elves &s;o much to overthrow, are an|&s;wered by Cobbett him&s;elf. In the dialogue between him and Dr. Cox, does he &s;peak as though he wi&s;hed to convince the public; as though he was attacking the &s;y&s;tem only? No, he does not pretend to have &s;pent a moments reflection either as to the &s;y&s;tem, or the cau&s;e, but that <HI>he knew nothing at all about it,</HI> he was only laughing about it, as his learned coun&s;el &s;ay! Here the "cloven foot" plainly appears, he acknowledges that if it had not been Dr. Ru&s;h who &s;upported the mode of treatment, he &s;hould not have troubled him&s;elf about it.</P>
<P>"Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth &s;peaketh." Little thought he that he was furni&s;hing evidence again&s;t him&s;elf at the trail.</P>
<P><PB REF="037103_0061_100D32FD79E92648">
In September, 1797, he &s;ets out &s;tigmatizing him with the epithet of "QUACK." Was not this the way to de&s;troy his reputation, by writing him down, by making the people believe he was a quack? Will gentlemen contend this is not actionable? If he is a quack in the yel|low fever, is he not to be pre&s;umed a quack in every other di&s;ea&s;e? If a man undertakes to be a phy&s;ician when he does not under&s;tand the nature or the cure of the di&s;order, is that man to be tru&s;ted?</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid that Dr. Ru&s;h's per&s;on was not attacked becau&s;e his family was not. Who could be ignorant of the contemptible point of view in which Dr. Ru&s;h was held up at this time, and &s;urely his family mu&s;t be very anxious as to his fate, and the in&s;ults he un|derwent. This, to me, is a good proof that it was the medical &s;kill of Dr. Ru&s;h that was attacked, for we find in other parts of the pub|lications that "Ru&s;h and <HI>the</HI> Ru&s;hites" are held in a very contempti|ble point of view, not being able to di&s;tingui&s;h between the &s;mall pox and the yellow fever, and the declaration is made, that pregnant wo|men were &s;ent by them to the ho&s;pital, thus &s;ugge&s;ting but in terms which cannot be mi&s;taken, the gro&s;s ignorance of this "Ma&s;ter Bleed|er," this "Potent Quack."</P>
<P>But &s;ay the Plaintiff's Coun&s;el this is not particularly aimed at Dr. Ru&s;h; it refers to a whole cla&s;s. But, Gentlemen, is it the <HI>less</HI> cri|minal becau&s;e the in&s;inuations extend to <HI>a whole class,</HI> in&s;tead of one individual? It is more a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;y&s;tem on that account. No, it cannot act as an extenuation, but an aggravation of the &s;lander.&mdash;Can you conceive that the introduction of Dr. Tilton, and this letter concerning him was nece&s;&s;ary to the mere di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;y&s;tem? 'Tis true that no action has been brought by Dr. Tilton, but Cobbett appears to be following up his abu&s;e upon Dr. Ru&s;h by that circum|&s;tance, repre&s;enting Dr. Tilton as a violent party man; mentioning him as ill formed, and that his judgment was wrong in as much as he mi&s;took a brui&s;e on the arm of a woman for the yellow fever. He attacks him as a Ru&s;hite and a "Bleeder."&mdash;As one of the exterminating Daemons. In&s;inuations, with &s;o much explanation, are fully equal to direct attacks. What means the in&s;inuation "that dead men tell no tales," &amp;c. but that he delighted in de&s;troying his fellow-creatures. That they are in&s;inuations does not deduct from the criminality. It is far wor&s;e than open attack, becau&s;e it adds <HI>meanness</HI> to <HI>malice.</HI></P>
<P>The words "Empyric" and "Quack," are u&s;ed through his whole reflections on Dr. Ru&s;h. We may therefore, a&s;k what means the word "Quack?"</P>
<P>"A boa&s;tful pretender to an art which he does not under&s;tand;&mdash;a vain boa&s;tful pretender to Phy&s;ic; one who proclaims his own medi|cal abilities in public places. So the learned Addi&s;on explains it. Pope calls it "an artful tricking practitioner in phy&s;ic."&mdash;"a mountebank; a bold and ignorant pretender to the art of phy&s;ic." It is a word of a determined, a&s;certained meaning, more &s;o than even bankrupt to a merchant.&mdash;Thus illiberally has he treated Dr. Ru&s;h, but has not ex|plained when bleeding ought, or ought not to be u&s;ed; what is mode|rate and what exce&s;&s;ive bleeding; nor an idea of the evils of the prac|tice; but with the mo&s;t inqui&s;itorial meanne&s;s, has blackened what he
<PB REF="037103_0062_100D3300D4303298">
could not attempt to confute. Can it be pretended that he was not well acquainted with the meaning of the words he u&s;ed? No, for at another period we perceive him boa&s;ting of his cla&s;&s;ical <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ading. He has de&s;ignedly called Dr. Ru&s;h a boa&s;tful pretender to phy&s;ic, an art which he did not under&s;tand; and this will appear from his fal&s;e repre|&s;entation of the Doctor's conduct in writing letters, &amp;c. Indeed in one place he &s;ays, the "citizens were duped" by that gentleman's conduct. It therefore cannot be doubted that he has been guilty of a libel.</P>
<P>While this profu&s;ion of abu&s;e is heaping on an innocent head, his coun&s;el think to le&s;&s;en his criminality by calling Doctor Ru&s;h a man as great as he is good. If they believe &s;o, how incon&s;i&s;tent is their de|fence of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of that great and good character!</P>
<P>If you wi&s;h information whether the&s;e words are in them&s;elves acti|onable or not, the law is very explicit on that head. The very words are &s;elected out in the elementary treati&s;es; they are the&s;e: "words are in them&s;elves actionable which injure a man in his trade or pro|fe&s;&s;ion; &s;uch as charge a want of hone&s;ty or ability, &amp;c." To call a "phy&s;ician a quack," is afterwards &s;elected <HI>particularly.</HI> William Cobbett, who is &s;tated by his coun&s;el to be a man of ability and learn|ing, no doubt knew this, and therefore, u&s;ed the very expre&s;&s;ions for|bid by the law, to defy the utmo&s;t power of the object of his attack. The words go on, "or that he has killed a patient with his phy&s;ic."&mdash;He has &s;elected the&s;e two parts which are actionable; he has called him "a quack," and then he has gone on to the comparative and &s;u|perlative degree&mdash;"a potent quack and mountebank," and in order to complete the degradation, he adds that in his mode of treatment he has "killed his thou&s;ands and tens of thou&s;ands."</P>
<P>But &s;ays my learned friend, this does not mean that <HI>he</HI> murdered them, but many died from this mode of treatment, and therefore it is only an attack upon the &s;y&s;tem. What &s;ays may authority? "If a man &s;ays a Phy&s;ician has killed his patients by his phy&s;ic" <HI>the words are actionable.</HI> Though a man does not charge mudrer on the Phy&s;i|cian, he is not excu&s;ed, it is enough, if it implies that per&s;ons were killed through ignorance; becau&s;e thereby he is not entitled to the confidence of his fellow citizens. The laws are not to be eluded by artful and ingenious con&s;tructions; you are the Judges, and can ea&s;ily under&s;tand the expre&s;&s;ions. Malice adopts an equivocal ambiguous &s;tile, but if the "cloven foot" is di&s;covered, if the veil is &s;een through, if the di&s;gui&s;e is di&s;covered, the law &s;trips the &s;heep's cloathing from the wolf, and expo&s;es him to indignation in his own natural deformi|ty.</P>
<P>But, &s;ay gentlemen, whatever might have been &s;aid, Dr. Ru&s;h has as much bu&s;ine&s;s as he can do, and therefore he is not injured.&mdash;Does this appear in evidence?&mdash;Is it fact?&mdash;I am authori&s;ed to &s;ay that his bu&s;ine&s;s has &s;en&s;ibly dimini&s;hed &s;ince the period at which the attack took place. But of this pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>It is enough for me if I prove that the words are actionable in them|&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB REF="037103_0063_100D33026171F360">
It is &s;aid that much di&s;pute and acrimony was u&s;ed in the controver|&s;y among the Phy&s;icians, and that it was no wonder if Cobbett forgot decency when Dr. Ru&s;h him&s;elf treated his opponents with &s;o much acrimony and &s;everity in his animadver&s;ions.</P>
<P>I do not &s;ee the force of this argument. If Doctor Ru&s;h <HI>had</HI> been guilty of even <HI>scandal</HI> in that di&s;qui&s;ition, would that ju&s;tify Cobbett to do &s;o too? If he has been guilty of &s;candal, let him &s;uffer for it from a due cour&s;e of law. But has Dr. Ru&s;h, from the beginning to the end of what has been read of his di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;y&s;tem, &s;tigma|tized any Phy&s;ician as a Quack? No, but he re&s;pectfully calls them his brethren and treats them with tenderne&s;s. He was learned on the &s;ubject, and was a proper per&s;on to lead the public opinion: if there|fore he has occa&s;ionally forgotten him&s;elf in &s;peaking of a countrary &s;y&s;tem, he may be excu&s;ed in part.</P>
<P>I &s;ay again if no injury, why take the&s;e methods if an injury, why not redre&s;s by law? My character&mdash;my profe&s;&s;ional and moral cha|racter attacked with the venom and art of a daemon&mdash;my daily bread about to be taken from me&mdash;the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for my family in danger of being lo&s;t to me&mdash;a head covered with grey hairs&mdash;fortune gone in pa|per money&mdash;prime of life pa&s;&s;ed in the revolutionary army&mdash;and law allow me no remedy: then the bands of &s;ociety are rent a&s;under&mdash;I am in a &s;tate of nature, let me &s;eek my private revenge, and I am &s;atisfied without the aid of courts&mdash;Oh no if the&s;e mea&s;ures are pur&s;ued I &s;hall be puni&s;hed&mdash;William Cobbett however ready to violate the law him|&s;elf we know is in the habit of appealing to law for his protections a|gain&s;t force and even again&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>The coun&s;el for the defendant then &s;oftened and we are told that the only con&s;olation left us under all this injury is &s;ilent contempt&mdash;&s;trange incon&s;i&s;tency&mdash;if a man takes my pur&s;e, value of one &s;hilling&mdash;laws and courts and juries give me remedy&mdash;but if he robs me of my good name, which ne'er enriches him, but makes me poor indeed, my only redre&s;s it is &s;aid is &s;ilent contempt.</P>
<P>If the evil extended, only to my&s;elf, the remedy the gentleman pre|&s;cribed, though much wor&s;e than bleeding or mercury, might be more palatable; but if I allow my&s;elf to be brought into di&s;repute in my pro|fe&s;&s;ion, to be con&s;idered as a Quack, as a pretender to knowledge in Phy&s;ic which I don't po&s;&s;e&s;s, my bu&s;ine&s;s will leave me, and my family &s;tarve&mdash;my wife be reduced to di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;my daughters expo&s;ed to &s;e|duction, my &s;ons be deprived of education and my&s;elf left a mi&s;erable object of delu&s;ion and pity.</P>
<P>It is true, as the learned gentleman ob&s;erved the &s;ame words, if &s;po|ken are not actionable which are &s;o when written or printed and pub|li&s;hed&mdash;the poi&s;on is in that way infinitely more di&s;&s;eminated&mdash;3 Black|&s;tone 126, words &s;poken to me in the &s;treets, may not be actionable, which if reduced to writing, are &s;o, the words in the in&s;tance of the young lady, who recovered &pound;4000 &s;terling damages, would not have been actionable if they had merely been &s;poken, the publication of actiona|ble words imply malice, unle&s;s explained by the defendant.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary however that we &s;hould &s;hew the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, in order to e&s;timate the nature of the offence. The&s;e po&s;itions
<PB REF="037103_0064_100D2DF46367BC68">
laid down, I &s;hall undertake to &s;hew that the defendant was determined to ruin Dr. Ru&s;h as a <HI>Physician,</HI> becau&s;e he was a <HI>"Republican."</HI></P>
<P>I think it is perfectly evident that he was not actuated by any motive to di&s;cu&s;s any &s;y&s;tem for the cure of the yellow-fever.&mdash;Let us examine the facts. The defendant began his pre&s;s early in 1796: the &s;entiments of Dr. Ru&s;h and his mode of treatment were perfectly notorious in 1793. I call upon the coun&s;el, even at this late hour, to &s;hew one word about Dr. Ru&s;h in that paper previous to the eulogium in De|cember 1796&mdash;immediately afterwards the defendant thinks him "too republican," and he &s;ays "damn him, I will attack him for it." I argue, the medical &s;y&s;tem of Dr. Ru&s;h being well known in 1793, why did he wait till the &s;pring of 1797 before he threatened, and till the September following before he executed his threat? Not a &s;ingle word about his republican principles! I know the ingenious turn that was endeavored to be given to the&s;e words&mdash;<HI>that he would attack the principle.</HI> No, gentlemen, the witne&s;s would not give the an&s;wer in that way: no, &s;aid he, he di&s;approved of the principle and he would attack HIM for it.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t we are all Republicans&mdash;Is there a man who hears me that does not feel and indignation in his brea&s;t that an <HI>alien</HI> &s;hould abu&s;e him becau&s;e he is a republican! The citizen of the United States who is not a republican, is a traitor. I am by choice a republican;&mdash;I am &s;o by oath: The con&s;titution of the United States is a republi|can form of government, and a republican form of government is guaranteed to each State.</P>
<P>But &s;ays the gentleman, there is a &s;en&s;e in which <HI>republicanism</HI> is a&s;&s;umed, it may mean <HI>democrat</HI> or <HI>sans cullotte:</HI> But I a&s;k, do they &s;how any paragraph in his writings or any action of his life in which he does not avow him&s;elf a <HI>republican,</HI> not in forced, but in the con&s;ti|tutional &s;en&s;e of the word. When a term is u&s;ed, of determinate &s;en&s;e in the con&s;titution of my country, I ought to be under&s;tood in that &s;en&s;e. And has Dr. Ru&s;h from the memorable day on which he voted for, and &s;igned the declaration of our independence, till the pre|&s;ent moment ever proved him&s;elf to be any other than a <HI>republican</HI> in the con&s;titutional &s;en&s;e? The in&s;inuations of his deviation might have been &s;pared, &s;ince they are totally void of foundation. But republi|cani&s;m is the whole extent of the offence for which he is to be per&s;e|cuted while living, and his very a&s;hes raked up to obtain a vindictive &s;atisfaction upon his mangled memory after his death! And for all this &s;hall we &s;ay, Go, and take a boxing match with William Cob|bett? No, gentlemen, courts and juries will give a righteous and honorable deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>I do not wonder at his re&s;entment again&s;t Dr. Ru&s;h: he is one of tho&s;e who in the language of the Pre&s;ident of the United States, have <HI>done too much, suffered too much, and succeeded too well</HI> in our glorious &s;truggle for liberty, ever to be forgiven. Gentlemen, I conceive an appeal to your feelings to be fair, becau&s;e by temperate deductions I have e&s;tabli&s;hed facts:&mdash;I &s;ee the &s;un &s;hine, and the &s;howers de&s;cend&mdash;I afterwards &s;ee the gra&s;s grow: I thence form a natural conclu&s;ion that one is the cau&s;e, the other the effect. The ingenious eva&s;ion of the
<PB REF="037103_0065_100D33074CB2AFC8">
gentlemen, that it was the political opinion he threatened to Dr. Dewees to attack, will not do: no, he mu&s;t approach under a ma&s;ked battery: the political &s;entiment was the real ground of the offence. When the threat was made, the opportunity to execute it was wanting; he therefore &s;uffered the malice to lie in his brea&s;t, until one the mo&s;t fit that could po&s;&s;ibly occur made its appearance: one which could not po&s;&s;ibly at the time of the threat have entered into the contemplation of the defendant. But the mea&s;ure was re&s;olved on&mdash;the death war|rant was prepared&mdash;a more fit opportunity could not have been wi&s;hed for than the fever of 1797 in one re&s;pect, nor one le&s;s fit in another. We cannot reflect on the &s;ituation of our deplorable city at that pe|riod, and not be &s;truck with horror at the recollection. We &s;ee the patient in extreme di&s;tre&s;s, &s;tretched on his bed of &s;ickne&s;s; phy&s;icians them&s;elves at a lo&s;s how to relieve that di&s;tre&s;s. It was at this event|ful period. William Cobbett began his malevolent attacks; tending to withdraw the confidence of the unhappy patients from their phy&s;ician, and thus doubling their affliction.</P>
<P>Farther. This attack was not only threatened, but with violence; he a&s;&s;igns his rea&s;on, "Damn him, I will attack him for it."&mdash;The reputation of Dr. Ru&s;h was intimately connected with his political &s;entiments, and therefore he attacks the phy&s;ician.&mdash;It is ob&s;ervable, that when he fir&s;t threatens the attack, &s;o far was he from being ac|tuated by a wi&s;h to repel an improper mode of practice in Dr. Ru&s;h as a phy&s;ician, that in that character he &s;peaks of him as liable to no exception: He wi&s;hes him to confine him&s;elf wholly to his practice as a phy&s;ician, and not to meddle with politics. But Dr. Ru&s;h was his ob|ject. "Malice rankles in his heart," and a few expre&s;&s;ions which find their way out now and then, prove it to be deep rooted.&mdash;He confe&s;&s;ed he knew nothing about the practice.</P>
<P>Doctors Griffith and Phy&s;ic, commonly made u&s;e of the medicine and practice of Dr. Ru&s;h, and to as great a degree, but they had &s;po|ken no eulogium; they had made no u&s;e of any <HI>republican</HI> expre&s;&s;ions, and therefore they e&s;caped without a &s;ingle remark. Farther than that, Cobbett employed a family phy&s;ician of the &s;ame &s;chool: Dr. Dewees, who followed the &s;ame mode of treatment, attended on the family. All this proves the meaning of the words u&s;ed to Dr. Cox: that if it had not been &s;upported by Dr. Ru&s;h, he &s;hould not have troubled him|&s;elf about it.</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons, gentlemen, I think I may pre&s;ume, without the po&s;&s;ibility of a doubt, that you will be of the opinion, that the action is well founded: that the words are, in them&s;elves, <HI>actionable,</HI> and that they imply <HI>malice.</HI> But we have not re&s;ted on the legal ground, as we might with &s;afety: we have gone farther, we have &s;hewn that per&s;onal re&s;entment in&s;tigated to the malicious attack, and that it was the &s;ole and entire motive.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I do not wi&s;h to introduce dome&s;tic &s;cenes unnece&s;&s;a|rily; but &s;urely when we contemplate injuries and damages &s;u&s;tained, we may, at lea&s;t, relate what effect it might probably have on the family. Doctor Ru&s;h was engaged amid&s;t &s;cenes of danger and death; not only expo&s;ed to, but actually attacked by that dreadful di&s;ea&s;e.
<PB REF="037103_0066_100D3309732FE5A8">
His family were re&s;iding in the country. In&s;tead of receiving letters from him, <HI>his affliction was so severe he could not write,</HI> &s;uppo&s;e they receive the&s;e papers, in which he is &s;tigmatized a "murderer" and "quack" and though he might &s;urvive the contagion, his character &s;hould remain a&s;per&s;ed and his memory after his death. So unde&s;erv|ing public confidence.&mdash;Would this have no effect on his family?</P>
<P>We have heard much about the liberty of the pre&s;s. I think I would not yield to any man in &s;incere e&s;timation of that invaluable right; I con&s;ider it the <HI>eye</HI> of our political body, and I would much rather a &s;peck a &s;mall blemi&s;h &s;hould remain, than that by a ra&s;h and un|&s;kilful operation the noble organ it&s;elf &s;hould receive an injury. But it is difficult to run the preci&s;e line in compo&s;ing the happy medium which the con&s;titution has formed for the &s;upport of every thing which is dear to a citizen. In the con&s;titution formed for Cor&s;ica, vide annual re|gi&s;ter of 1794 p. 90 are the&s;e words: "The liberty of the pre&s;s is de|creed, but the abu&s;e of it is left to the law." Private reputation and character is protected by the con&s;titution, the great fundamental law of this &s;tate.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I acknowledge that this ca&s;e, now about to be decided by you, is one of the mo&s;t important ever intru&s;ted to a jury of this country. It is true that for a long time pa&s;t the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the pre&s;s has been extreme: neither the government nor individuals have e&s;caped: no merit of character has &s;creened the individual from attack through that medium. It is therefore that you ought to keep a &s;tea|dy watch over tho&s;e intru&s;ions upon the good order of &s;ociety, for it is with you to protect character and government, which if you neglect, like the droppings of rain on a &s;tone, it will wear it imperceptibly away: though the progre&s;s be &s;low, the effect is certain.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, you mu&s;t take human nature as you find it, and we &s;hould not better it had we the power of formation: of the law does not give &s;atisfaction for injuries, it is a &s;entiment written on the heart of man that <HI>he will obtain it,</HI> and no law will then &s;top his re&s;entment. Of what avail, it will be argued, was it for me to re&s;train the impetuo&s;i|ty of my temper and a await the cour&s;e pointed out by the laws of my country: In vain do I re&s;pect them unle&s;s damages are given &s;ufficient to &s;top the progre&s;s of a gro&s;s offence.&mdash;You will have no more com|plaints of this &s;ort, but they will be obtained in another, and mo&s;t fatal way, if the law is not &s;ufficiently &s;trong to curb it.</P>
<P>In England we find that juries under&s;tood this &s;ubject perfectly well.&mdash;Mr. Tilghman &s;ays it was a general warrant which affected the individual liberty which made them &s;o &s;evere in the ca&s;es referred to. The judge &s;aid it ought to be exemplary in order to protect the magna|charta: &s;o we &s;ay. So ought you to &s;ay in your verdict: it is not the injury &s;u&s;tained by Dr. Ru&s;h by the number of patients he has lo&s;t. The gentleman read the declaration and made &s;ome ob&s;ervations upon the <HI>blanks.</HI> He &s;ays no &s;pecial damages are laid. Are we to run about to enquire who never came to Dr. Ru&s;h on this account? If that is re|quired, it may as well be &s;aid at once that we &s;hall have no damages, and that men &s;hall publi&s;h what they plea&s;e with impunity!</P>
<P><PB REF="037103_0067_100D330BA7F55EC0">
As I ob&s;erved before, in England juries under&s;tand this matter per|fectly well. If a libel involves the public peace and good, &s;pecific injuries are not con&s;idered. In the ca&s;e of a young lady who&s;e cha&s;|tity was attacked, 40<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">0&pound; was awarded.</P>
<P>I hope Dr. Ru&s;h will not have to &s;ay as a gentleman in Scotland once &s;aid, <Q>Oh that I had brought forward this trial in England, for there the Jury would take care the verdict &s;hould be &s;uch as would do honor to their impartiality.</Q> Gentlemen, the precedent cannot fail to have a de&s;irable effect, if you give &s;uitable damages. In&s;tances &s;eldom occur in Penn&s;ylvania of this nature, but in one not long &s;ince the Jury proved that they will knew the importance of private charac|ter: a per&s;on was proceeded again&s;t <HI>ex parte</HI> by one of the German religious &s;ocieties, and excluded. The proceeding was entered upon the books of the Society. As it was an attack upon character, the man brought an action, and the Jury gave a verdict for the plaintiff of 500&pound;. damages. Cafe, Stock again&s;t the German corporation.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, con&s;ider the &s;ituation of Dr. Ru&s;h at the time of at|tact;&mdash;a Phy&s;ician of con&s;iderable ability in his art&mdash;at a period when his whole attention was doubtle&s;s engaged for the advantage of a de|plorable city: when not an <HI>Herb</HI> nor <HI>Drug</HI> e&s;caped his utmo&s;t re&s;earch|es; when not a part of the Human Sy&s;tem but he pryed into; all his learning, all his ingenuity on the full &s;tretch. The life of thou&s;ands in his hands, an important charge! Surrounded with difficulties, and thus indefatigably engaged he is repre&s;ented as the mo&s;t de&s;picable of the human race. I a&s;k you, gentlemen, whether this did not di&s;able him from pro&s;ecuting his important pur&s;uits? much of cure in &s;uch deplorable &s;ituations, depend on the confidence of the patient in his Phy&s;ician, often more than in medicine: we know how much &s;mall &s;hocks affect the mind &s;o weakened by di&s;ea&s;e.&mdash;Who can tell what numbers peri&s;hed from the&s;e publications in this way?</P>
<P>We are told that though Dr. Ru&s;h has his merit, he no doubt had his reward. I a&s;k how he could receive his reward? among what cla&s;s of per&s;ons did his practice extend? We well know that the rich had left the city, and therefore the thou&s;ands upon whom he attended could not pay him: it would have been to his advantage to have left the city, for a man of his eminence could have commanded bu&s;ine&s;s any where, but his point was to di&s;cover if po&s;&s;ible, an alleviation of the general di&s;tre&s;s by examining and exploring this new &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;e, which has &s;o often baffled the utmo&s;t &s;kill of talents.</P>
<P>As to the merit of the defendant. It is &s;aid that he was of great u&s;e at a certain time in giving an alarm to the citizens of this country again&s;t foreign influence. I will tell you how far he went, and no farther: <HI>He did not wish to destroy, but to change this foreign influence.</HI> He wi&s;hed to de&s;troy it when it came from one foreign country, and place it on another. But to Americans &s;en&s;ible of the high de&s;|tinies of their country, what is it from whom the influence comes? it ought to be wholly de&s;troyed, come whence it may from France or from Britain.</P>
<P>I do not know that I need take up your time in referring to the opinion <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of the plaintiff in other countries: &s;uffice it to &s;ay
<PB REF="037103_0068_100D330D5C877398">
that almo&s;t every Philo&s;ophical and medical &s;ociety in the world have honored his character. He is an honorary member of almo&s;t every &s;o|ciety in Europe, or in the world. Dr. Trotter, the celebrated Phy&s;i|cian in England &s;peaks of him in terms &s;trongly indicative of the ve|neration in which he is held abroad.</P>
<P>Although &s;o great is his character and reputation, yet I acknow|ledge that the ca&s;e is between A. plaintiff and B. defendant. But al|though your verdict mu&s;t be according to evidence and ju&s;tice, yet you mu&s;t not be unmindful of character in order duly to e&s;timate the da|mages. If Dr. Ru&s;h had not obtained a well earned reputation, I &s;hould not be pre&s;&s;ing upon you to bear te&s;timony to that character by exemplary damages, but the malevolent de&s;ign, the &s;pite and the ill na|ture is much blackened by the uprightne&s;s of character procured and pre&s;erved for many year by the plaintiff.</P>
<P>Gentlemen I thank you for your attention&mdash;I mu&s;t in my conclu&s;i|on beg you to con&s;ider the great evils of <HI>slander.</HI> Permit me to at|tempt its definition. Among&s;t all the offences that degenerate man|kind can commit is one of the greate&s;t: there is nothing that an hone&s;t and brave man has &s;o much to fear.</P>
<P><HI>Man need not dread a worse foe&mdash;it stabs with a word&mdash;It is the PESTI|LENCE walking in darkness, spreading CONTAGION far and wide, which the most cautious traveller cannot avoid.&mdash;COURAGE cannot defend against its insidious attacks&mdash;It is the heart searching DAGGER of the dark AS|SASSIN.&mdash;It is the poisoned ARROW whose wound is incurable.&mdash;It is the mortal sting of the deadly ADDER:&mdash;nor GOVERNMENT nor OFFICER nor INDIVIDUAL can resist its fatal effects without the aid of LAW.&mdash;MUR|DER is its employment; INNOCENCE and MERIT its prey, and RUIN its SPORT.</HI></P>
