<Q><BIBL>2 PETER I.12, 13.14.</BIBL>
<P>"Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of the&s;e things; though ye know them, and be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the pre&s;ent truth: Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to &s;tir you up by putting you in remembrance; knowing that &s;hortly I mu&s;t put off this my tabernacle, as our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath &s;hewed me."</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>DEATH is the common lot of all a men. Whether we &s;u&s;tain a public, or private character in life, we &s;hall, in a little time, go the way whence we &s;hall not return. And the thought, that we mu&s;t certainly and &s;hort|ly
<PB N="6" REF="011207_0004_0F862C72F1C0F810">
leave this pre&s;ent world, is powerfully adapt|ed to awaken our powers, and excite us to dili|gence in doing the work that is re&s;pectively a&s;|&s;igned us, in the providence of God. Said our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, while on earth, "I mu&s;t work the work of him that &s;ent me." And why? the rea&s;on follows in the next words, "for the night cometh, wherein no man can work." To the like purpo&s;e, it was the re&s;olution of the apo&s;tle Peter, in my text, to be ever diligent in his duty, as a mini&s;ter of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and upon this motive, "knowing that &s;hortly I mu&s;t put off this my tabernacle."</P>
<P>HE &s;pake the&s;e words with a more imme|diate referrence to him&s;elf: But they are equal|ly applicable to all, whom it has plea&s;ed God to entru&s;t with the mini&s;try of the go&s;pel of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And in this accommodated view, the two following things are ob&s;ervable in them.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE duty of go&s;pel mini&s;ters, intimated in tho&s;e words, "I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of the&s;e things."</P>
<P N="2">II. THE motive by which this duty is en|forced; "knowing that &s;hortly I mu&s;t put off this my tabernacle, as our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath &s;hewed me."</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, the&s;e are the particulars to employ your thoughts, and then to be applied to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="7" REF="011207_0005_0F862C73B2699420">I. THE fir&s;t thing ob&s;ervable in the text is, the duty of go&s;pel mini&s;ters; &s;ugge&s;ted in tho&s;e words, "I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of the&s;e things; though ye know them, and be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the pre&s;ent truth: Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to &s;tir you up by putting you in remembrance."</P>
<P>THE per&s;ons, to whom the apo&s;tle Peter was now writing, had, for a con&s;iderable time, made a profe&s;&s;ion of the chri&s;tian faith; for which rea&s;on, he was rather concerned to refre&s;h their minds with a "remembrance of the things which they knew already," than to tickle their ears with new notions which they had never heard of before. Accordingly, having ex|horted them, in the foregoing part of this chap|ter, not to re&s;t &s;atisfied with their having "faith" in the go&s;pel revelation, but to "give diligence to add to their faith, virtue, and knowledge, and temperance, and patience and godline&s;s, and brotherly kindne&s;s, and charity," and to "abound" in the&s;e graces; a&s;&s;uring them "that &s;o entrance &s;hould be mini&s;tred to them abundantly into the everla&s;ting kingdom of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t:" I &s;ay, having thus exhor|ted them, he re&s;olves in the words of the text now under con&s;ideration, to repeat his exhor|tations "to the&s;e things;" and to go on &s;o doing "as long as he lived," not allowing him &s;elf to be ever "negligent" to put them in mind|of &s;uch important points, in the bu&s;ine&s;s of their &s;alvation. Not that he hereby intended to &s;ug|ge&s;t,
<PB N="8" REF="011207_0006_0F862C7466679E88">
that they were ignorant of the&s;e great truths of religion: He rather &s;uppo&s;ed they were "knowing" in them; yea, that they were "well e&s;tabli&s;hed" in the faith of them. But yet, he judged it "meet" to reiterate the enforcement of the&s;e truths; frequently bring|ing them to their "remembrance," and, by this means, keeping them, as it were, perpe|tually pre&s;ent in their minds for their &s;piritual advantage.</P>
<P>AND we may herefrom learn much of the duty of the pre&s;ent mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel. They have to do chiefly with tho&s;e, who may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to be well in&s;tructed al|ready in the principles and duties of chri&s;tianity. And their bu&s;ine&s;s is, not to gratify their cu|rio&s;ity, by telling them new and &s;trange things; but to "&s;tir up their minds" by way of recol|lection; to revive in their memories the actual pre&s;ence of old truths, and to do it in &s;uch a manner as that they may, if po&s;&s;ible, be quickened and excited by them to the purpo&s;es of &s;piritual edification.</P>
<P>IT may po&s;&s;ibly be an objection with &s;ome, to giving their attendance on the word publick|ly preached, that they &s;hall be in&s;tructed in nothing new. The preacher, &s;ay they, will have nothing to &s;ay but what has been often &s;aid already. And why &s;hould we trou|ble our &s;elves to go to hear that, which we have heard, and know before?</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="011207_0007_0F862C752F32E2C0">THE apo&s;tle Peter did not think there was any weight in objections of this kind. For he &s;pake very pre&s;&s;ingly to the gentile chri&s;tians concerning the things, which they "knew al|ready;" yea, and he re&s;olved to go on repeating "the&s;e things," though they were "e&s;tabli&s;hed" in the belief them, as long as he lived.</P>
<P>AND it is, in it&s;elf, a "meet," fit thing, that mi|ni&s;ters &s;hould repeatedly call people's attention to the things which they "already know" For they really need to have the great truths of God, and religion, urged upon them by reiterated exhortations. Tis not enough, that they are &s;peculatively acquainted with go&s;pel doctrines; but the&s;e mu&s;t be made pre&s;ent to their minds, by a frequent and continued "&s;tirring up" of your memories: Otherwi&s;e, though they "know them," they will receive little &s;piritual benefit from them. For, tis worthy of our no|tice, the truths of religion, however great and important, can operate upon men, to the produc|tion of corre&s;ponding effects, in no way but by their pre&s;ence in the mind, and its being actually employed in exerci&s;ing its thoughts, with reference to them. And in order to this, it is highly proper, in true rea&s;on, that they &s;hould be frequently made thus pre&s;ent by the mini|&s;ters of the go&s;pel. Many people would other|wi&s;e, it may be, &s;carce ever attend to tho&s;e things which they knew to be truths, and truths too of the greate&s;t importance. For however apt men may be to keep in mind the things that concern their outward, and temporal welfare,
<PB N="10" REF="011207_0008_0F862C75F496EBD0">
they are certainly very forgetful of tho&s;e, which relate to their &s;ouls, and their &s;piritual and ever|la&s;ting welfare. It is therefore no &s;mall part of the work, and duty, of go&s;pel mini&s;ters, to bring the great truths of chri&s;tianity frequently be|fore the view of their people; calling their atten|tion to them, and repeatedly fixing their thoughts upon them, if po&s;&s;ibly they may have a &s;utable operation upon their hearts and lives.</P>
<P>THIS was certainly the practice of the apo&s;tles of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The apo&s;tle Peter, in my text, "thought it meet" to enforce the &s;ame truths upon the chri&s;tians he was concern|ed with, and to be "always diligent" herein. And the apo&s;tle Paul applies to the chri&s;tians at Philippi, in &s;uch language as that, (Phil. iii.1.) "Brethren to write the &s;ame things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is &s;afe." And our Savior's character of a wi&s;e, and faithful &s;teward of the mi&s;teries of the go&s;pel is, "that he brings out of his trea&s;ure things that are old as well as new," Matt. xiii.52. And thus our Savior did him&s;elf. If we look over the ac|counts of his preaching, as they are recorded in the four go&s;pels, we &s;hall find that he often urged upon his hearers "the things pertaining to the kingdom of God;" reiterating his in|&s;tructions from time to time, and refre&s;hing their memories by calling them to attend to the "&s;ame truths;" and all, that He might fa&s;ten them in their hearts, &s;o as to be powerful prin|ciples of action.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="011207_0009_0F862C76AF1928D0">TIS true, our Savior, in his day, and his apo&s;tles in theirs, endeavoured to render the "&s;ame truths" agreable, by the various man|ner in which they propo&s;ed and urged them. Hence the many parables in which our Savi|or has &s;et forth the &s;ame divine truths. And hence the many &s;imilies and metaphors, that are u&s;ed to expre&s;s the &s;ame thoughts, both by our Lord him&s;elf, and his apo&s;tles after him.</P>
<P>THOSE, who are entru&s;ted with the care of &s;ouls, would do well to place their ma&s;ter, and his apo&s;tles, before their view, and to copy after the pattern they have &s;et them. It is proper, I may rather &s;ay nece&s;&s;ary, we &s;hould &s;ay the "&s;ame things", repeating them over and over again; yet, we &s;hould endeavour to do this, not in a round of the &s;ame words, but by an agrea|ble variety in phra&s;e, metaphor, and arange|ment of thought. It &s;hould be our &s;tudy to "find out acceptable words", &s;o to expre&s;s our|&s;elves as that, what we deliver may be handed to our people in a manner as little tedious, and as well-plea&s;ing as may be. And we &s;hall now, in the be&s;t adapted way, lay our &s;elves out to preach to them &s;o as that, if it be not owing to them&s;elves, they may be profited, even when their attention is called to tho&s;e truths, in point of faith or practice, which they knew before, and had been often inculcated on them.&mdash;But I mu&s;t proceed to the</P>
<P N="2">II. SECOND thing ob&s;ervable in my text, and this is, the motive by which the duty mentioned
<PB N="12" REF="011207_0010_0F862C7778F52D40">
is enforced. It is contained in tho&s;e words, "knowing that &s;hortly I mu&s;t put off this my ta|bernacle, as our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath &s;hew|ed me."</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle, you ob&s;erve, here &s;peaks of his body figuratively; calling it "his tent, or tabernacle:" and with great propriety and beau|ty. For the human body is, in its pre&s;ent con|dition, a frail feeble &s;tructure, ea&s;ily taken down, and de&s;igned but for a &s;hort continuance. We are "pilgrims and &s;trangers here on earth, as were all our fathers before us", and dwell in tents of clay, from which we &s;hall &s;oon be removed; though ble&s;&s;ed be the God of all grace, the time is coming, when the&s;e our "vile bodies" &s;hall, if we are "faithful to the death," be fa&s;hioned into fixed, durable, glorious buildings, "hou&s;es not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."</P>
<P>"PUTTING off" a garment is a common mode of diction; but we do not &s;peak of "putting off" a tent. "Taking it down, or going out of it," is the u&s;ual form of expre&s;&s;ion. Yet the Holy Gho&s;t has been plea&s;ed, while comparing the body to a tabernacle, to con&s;ider death as "putting off" one's cloths; blending together different metaphors: unle&s;s it &s;hould be &s;uppo|&s;ed, which, perhaps, is the truth, that the origi|nal word (apothe&s;is) here tran&s;lated "putting off," might as properly be rendered "laying a&s;ide", "laying down," as a thing to be u&s;ed no more; and then there will be no varying of figures.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="011207_0011_0F862C7835E6A908">THE apo&s;tle &s;ays, "he knew that he &s;hould lay a&s;ide his tabernacle," or, in other words, that he &s;hould die. Nor could he have been igno|rant of this mo&s;t certain truth. "The living know that they &s;hall die." They know it from the appointment of God, which is of univer&s;al extent; taking in the whole human race, with|out exception or limitation. And they knew it al&s;o from the univer&s;al empire of death over all the &s;ons and daughters of Adam, whether rich or poor, wi&s;e or fooli&s;h; or however di&s;crimina|ted from each other by their &s;tations in life.</P>
<P>HE adds, that he knew that he &s;hould "SHORT|LY lay a&s;ide his tabernacle, as our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t had &s;hewed him." Some of the ancient fathers have &s;aid, that the preci&s;e time of his death, which was now near at hand, was made known to him by a vi&s;ion from heaven; and that, in this way, he knew from Chri&s;t, that his continuance here would be "&s;hort." But this is nothing more than mere conjecture. Tis true, God acquainted Mo&s;es with the approach of his death, and made it certain to the apo&s;tle Paul that he &s;hould &s;oon be martyred. And he might, by vi&s;ion, or a voice from heaven, or in &s;ome other way, reveal it to Peter that he &s;hould "&s;hortly lay a&s;ide his earthly tabernacle." But there is no need of any &s;uch &s;uppo&s;ition. And tis mo&s;t probable, he collected the near approach of his death from tho&s;e words, in John xxi 18.19. which our Lord &s;pake to him, while he dwelt in fle&s;h. "Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto thee, when thou wa&s;t young, thou girded&s;t thy &s;elf, and
<PB N="14" REF="011207_0012_0F862C78E826A7F0">
walked&s;t whither thou woulde&s;t; but when thou &s;halt be old, thou &s;halt &s;tretch forth thy hands, and another &s;hall gird thee, and carry thee whi|ther thou woulde&s;t not". The in&s;pired evan|geli&s;t adds hereupon, in the following ver&s;e, "This &s;pake he (that is Je&s;us) &s;ignifying by what death he &s;hould glorify God". Tis cer|tain, and very obviou&s;ly &s;o, from tho&s;e words of our Lord to Peter, that he &s;hould die a martyr in his cau&s;e, when he was grown old; and be|ing now a man advanced in age, he "knew" by what "our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t had &s;hewed him," many years before, that he mu&s;t "&s;hortly" die. He firmly believed what he had been told by his Lord, and collected herefrom that the time of his departure was at hand, that he &s;hould "&s;hortly" be "girded," and carried to execution for his adherence to the religion of Je&s;us. And that he did, according to this prediction of Chri&s;t, &s;uffer martyrdom, and about the time that he here &s;ays he "knew" he &s;hould, we have the te&s;timony of Clement of Rome, of Lactan|tius, Eu&s;ebius, and others.</P>
<P>THE compo&s;ure of mind, the truly chri&s;tian fortitude, with which he here &s;peaks of his ap|proaching death, is worthy of &s;pecial notice. He was, in the fir&s;t days of his di&s;ciple&s;hip, &s;hame|fully intimidated in a time of danger; in&s;omuch that, through the influence of fear, he was over|come to "deny his Lord," affirming with great vehemency, "I know not the man." But, being recovered by repentance, and growing "&s;trong in faith," and in the grace that is in Chri&s;t
<PB N="15" REF="011207_0013_0F862C79A35BC200">
Je&s;us," he became fearle&s;s of death, yea, of death by the violence of per&s;ecutors; as knowing the truth of chri&s;tianity, and that, by quitting his tabernacle on earth, for the &s;ake of his ma&s;ter and &s;avior, he &s;hould be fixed in a building of God that would be gloriou&s;ly incapable of being ever pulled down by men, or devils.</P>
<P>INSTEAD of being di&s;couraged, or affrightened, at the knowledge of the nearne&s;s of his death, and by the hands of violence, he is rather influ|enced and quickened to greater zeal and dili|gence in pre&s;&s;ing important, though well-known, truths. He e&s;teemed the "&s;hortne&s;s" of his continuance in life a cogent rea&s;on, why he &s;hould be more laboriou&s;ly active, if po&s;&s;ible, than ever, in urging upon the chri&s;tians he had opportuni|ty to preach to, a due regard to the religion of Je&s;us, they had been already in&s;tructed in. And in the doing of this, he mentions that tender and affecting circum&s;tance, "his being to die &s;hortly", becau&s;e the words of a dying friend are won't ordinarily to come with greater force, and to make the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on the mind.</P>
<P>AND the con&s;ideration of the "&s;hortne&s;s" of the time he had to live excited his zeal to "write" as well as to preach, that he might promote the intere&s;t of the kingdom of Chri&s;t. So we read in the ver&s;e immediately following the text, "moreover, I will endeavour that you may be able, after my decea&s;e, to have the&s;e things al|ways in remembrance." The&s;e things he would endeavour they &s;hould "always have in remem|brance,"
<PB N="16" REF="011207_0014_0F862C7C7B94AB98">
were, the nece&s;&s;ity of practi&s;ing the virtues of the chri&s;tian life, mentioned, v.5. and onwards; and that, if they did &s;o, they &s;hould "have an abundant entrance into God's ever|la&s;ting kingdom." More important truths they could not remember. "The&s;e things" the apo&s;tle Peter had preached; and, not thinking this &s;ufficient, he committed them to writing in the two epi&s;tles that go under his name, that they might be remembered after he was dead and gone. As one ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, "He thought writing "much preferable to oral tradition, for pre&s;erving the exact knowledge and remem|brance of truths of the la&s;t con&s;equence. And he judged well. For what have we of certainty from "oral tradition?" whereas the&s;e two epi&s;|tles have already continued above 1600 years, and are as able to put us "in remembrance of the&s;e things," as ever they were to do the like to chri&s;tians of former ages. And I doubt not but they will continue to the end of the world, and be of &s;ervice, wherever they are carefully attended to". The &s;ame excellent author adds, tho&s;e who are heartily concerned for truth and purity, will do all they can to promote them while living, and that truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s may continue in the world when they are in their grave. St. Peter had the &s;ame regard for the chri&s;tian church, that Laelius expre&s;&s;ed for the common-wealth, when he &s;aid, "I have no le&s;s concern for the common-wealth after my death, than for its pro&s;perity at this pre&s;ent time."</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="011207_0015_0F862C7F13C17AD8">But the "motive" in my text, is not peculiar to the apo&s;tle Peter. It is adapted, in its nature, to operate powerfully upon all whom it has plea&s;ed God to put into the mini&s;try. Tis true, we do not "know," the &s;ame way in which Peter did, that we &s;hall "&s;hortly lay a&s;ide the&s;e our tabernacles"; we may not pre&s;ume to &s;ay, the time of our removal to another world has been "revealed" to us. We know not the day, or hour, or indeed the general period of life, when our Lord will call for us. But this notwith|&s;tanding, we certainly know, becau&s;e "our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t," in the &s;acred books of &s;cripture, "has &s;hewed us," that our continuance here is &s;hort; that, at longe&s;t, it will not be long, be|fore the places that now know us will know us no more. Says the apo&s;tle Paul, &s;peaking in the name of Chri&s;t, and as authori&s;ed by him, "the time is &s;hort." And this is the exact truth, &s;hould our time be protracted to the utmo&s;t length of human life. The &s;acred penmen, who wrote as they were influenced and guided by the Spirit of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, are repeatedly expre&s;s in their repre&s;entations of the brevity of our con|tinuance here on earth; and to impre&s;s our minds with a ju&s;t and deep &s;en&s;e of it, they not only affirm it as a truth, but make u&s;e of the &s;tronge&s;t metaphors to convey it to us in the mo&s;t &s;triking manner. They compare the dura|tion of life here to "a &s;hadow, which abideth not;" and to "a vapor, which appeareth for a little while, and then vani&s;heth away." They re&s;emble the &s;peed with which our days pa&s;s away to the ha&s;te of "a riding po&s;t;" to the
<PB N="18" REF="011207_0016_0F862C7FA8554970">
"&s;wift motion of a &s;hip under &s;ail;" yea, to the much &s;wifter motion of an "eagle in her flight towards her prey." With &s;uch &s;peed do we pa&s;s from one period of life to another, till life comes to an end, and we are here no more. Should "the days of our years" extend to "three&s;core years and ten; yea, &s;hould they, "by rea&s;on of &s;trength," reach to "fore&s;core years;" yet would they "&s;oon be cut off," they would &s;pend away "as a tale that is told", as the language is in the 90th P&s;alm.</P>
<P>WHAT more powerful motive, now, can be laid before go&s;pel-mini&s;ters, to engage their concern, and influence their endeavours, to &s;tir up their people to "keep in remembrance" the great things that pertain to the kingdom of God, and of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they may have been already in&s;tructed in? Mu&s;t we "&s;hortly" go out of the&s;e earthly tabernacles? Has "our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t," by the mo&s;t lively and af|fecting de&s;criptions, "&s;hewed us," that our con|tinuance here will be but a little while, at lon|ge&s;t? Oh! how can we, in this view of life, idle away our days in &s;loth, or that which is wor&s;e; neglecting to keep pre&s;ent in our minds, and in the minds of our people, the momentous truths of God and religion!

herewith? Is not Chri&s;t our Judge, as well as ma&s;ter? And will he not, when he "appears a &s;econd time in his own glory, and in his fathers, with the holy angels," reckon with us for our conduct in the mini&s;terial life? We &s;hall a&s;&s;uredly be called to render an account of the improve|ment of the great tru&s;t that has been committed to us.

<P>THUS go&s;pel mini&s;ters, in common, "know," by what "our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t has &s;hewed them," that they &s;hall "&s;hortly lay a&s;ide the&s;e their tabernacles," from whence they &s;hould be excited to the mo&s;t vigorous exertions in working the work which has been committed to them as their &s;pecial charge. But there are &s;ome, among the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, to whom he is "&s;hewing" that they will &s;till more &s;hortly leave the&s;e "hou&s;es of clay," who&s;e "foundation is in the du&s;t." So feeble is their make, &s;o weak their con&s;titution, and &s;o many the infirmities they are groaning under, that it is evidently made known to them, that they &s;hall not abide long in the fle&s;h." And this is eminently the ca&s;e of tho&s;e, who are ad|vanced in years, approaching towards, or having

already reached, the general period, the wi&s;dom of God has fixed for the duration of life. As for &s;uch, they know, becau&s;e it has been "&s;hewed" to them by the revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that the time of their departure is at hand. They are ignorant, it is true, of the preci&s;e time, when they mu&s;t leave this pre&s;ent world; but they certainly know, in general, that "the earthly hou&s;e of their tabernacle" will &s;hortly, very &s;hortly, "be di&s;&s;olved". And what a pow|erful motive is this to make them diligent and faithful in "&s;tirring up" their people, by "put|ting them in remembrance" of the great and nece&s;&s;ary truths of chri&s;tianity? The&s;e ought to have a mo&s;t lively and affecting pre&s;ence in their own minds. Their nearne&s;s to another world renders it eminently proper, I may &s;ay ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary. And if they have upon their own minds an impre&s;&s;ive &s;en&s;e of the infinite impor|tance of the great truths of God and religion, how can it be but that they &s;hould zealou&s;ly en|deavour to awaken, and keep alive, in the minds of their people, the like &s;erious and affecting &s;en&s;e of the&s;e things? They mu&s;t now be&s;tir them&s;elves, or they never will. For their time is &s;hort. In a little while, at longe&s;t, their &s;un will &s;et, and the night come on, when they can no more employ them&s;elves in &s;ervices for their own &s;ouls, or the &s;ouls of tho&s;e whom Chri&s;t has made their peculiar charge. They &s;hould therefore "do with their might what&s;oever their hands find to do;" remembring, that there is "no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wi&s;dom in the grave, whither they are going," and where they will &s;hortly be laid.</P>

Of the&s;e natural accompli&s;hments, &s;trengthened by improvement, his publications are a &s;pecimen; and they will do honor to him, as they have already done, in the opinion of all capable judges.</P>
<P>HE was a friend to liberty, e&s;pecially that "liberty wherewith our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t has made his churches free." In his younger years, particularly while at college, and under the pre|judice of education, his father being an epi&s;co|palian by profe&s;&s;ion and principle, he entertained &s;o &s;trong an opinion of the "Engli&s;h eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal e&s;tabli&s;hment," that it was his full intention to take orders in the church of England, and would &s;carce be per&s;uaded to read any authors but tho&s;e of that communion. But&punc; after he had proceeded batchelor of arts, in con&s;equence of diligent &s;tudy, and free conver&s;ation, he altered his &s;entiments, profe&s;&s;ing a firm adherence to the
<PB N="24" REF="011207_0022_0F862C84317C6D30">
mode of wor&s;hip and government practiced in the New-England churches. And though he always retained a candid charitable opinion of tho&s;e members of the Epi&s;copal church who&s;e be|havior was as becometh godline&s;s; yet it was his full per&s;ua&s;ion, that the church it &s;elf was defiled with the inventions of man, and laid an undue re&s;traint upon true chri&s;tian liberty. I know of no one that was, upon principle, a more zealous friend to the manner of wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline in the&s;e churches, and that more earne&s;tly de|precated tho&s;e innovations with which we have been threatned He has in as ma&s;terly a way, and with as comprehen&s;ive knowledge, wrote in defence of our "ordination by the hands of the pre&s;bytery," as any one I could name.</P>
<P>HE was al&s;o a fa&s;t friend to our college at cambridge, &s;ought its welfare, and laid him&s;elf out, within his proper &s;phere, to do it all the &s;ervice in his power.</P>
<P>HE was young when ordained a pa&s;tor of this church; but well qualified with gifts, and had, I tru&s;t, before that time, been made a partaker of the "grace that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us." He was, in that day, much applauded for his mini&s;terial accompli&s;hments. Multitudes flocked to hear him. No mini&s;ter in town, or country, was ac|counted either a more polite and elegant, or a more devout and edifying preacher. And this was the general voice concerning him, till di&s;or|ders, we are all liable to, weakened the vigor, perhaps, of his mind, as well as body. This
<PB N="25" REF="011207_0023_0F862C858CAF9AB8">
was undoubtedly the ca&s;e, in &s;ome of his later years. And if that chri&s;tian candor, which might rea&s;onably have been expected from tho&s;e e&s;pecially who had enjoyed the benefit of his for|mer more vigorous labors, had been in due exer|ci&s;e, it would have been no hindrance to their &s;piri|tual edification. Had he lived till the 20th of No|vember next, he would have been your fixed pa&s;tor for the long &s;pace of fifty two years. I bear him witne&s;s, he had an affectionate con|cern for your &s;piritual welfare, to which it was owing that he exhorted, rebuked, comforted, and charged you as a father doth his children; being willing to impart to you not only the go&s;|pel of the ble&s;&s;ed God, but his own &s;oul al&s;o, becau&s;e you were dear to him. Should I call you to it, you would openly declare, that he had been an "example to you in word, in con|ver&s;ation, in charity, in faith, in purity," and in all tho&s;e other virtues which adorn the chri&s;tian's and the mini&s;ter's character. Brethren, "you are witne&s;&s;es, and God al&s;o, how holily, and ju&s;tly, and unblamably, he behaved him&s;elf among you;" approving him&s;elf "a mini&s;ter of God, in much patience, in labor, in watchings, in fa&s;tings, by purene&s;s, by knowledge, by long|&s;uffering, by kindne&s;s, by the Holy Gho&s;t, by love unfeigned, by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteou&s;ne&s;s on the right hand, and on the left."</P>
<P>I may go on, and &s;ay, tho&s;e acquainted with Mr. Foxcroft mu&s;t have ob&s;erved his laudable
<PB N="26" REF="011207_0024_0F862C85B0CE0C90">
behaviour in the various relations of life. When an hu&s;band, how faithful and kind! As a father, how careful to in&s;truct, guide, and govern his children! As a ma&s;ter, how ju&s;t and equal! As a neighbour, how ready to all the offices of chri&s;tian goodne&s;s! As a mini&s;ter, how diligent, con&s;tant, and laborious in doing the duties of his calling! How &s;kilful a divider of the word of truth! How pungent in his applications to the &s;ouls of his hearers! How careful to adapt his di&s;cour&s;es to the various occurrences in provi|dence that they might, by this means, be the more &s;ea&s;onable, and profitable! How fervent was his zeal for the cau&s;e of God and religion! How re&s;olute his boldne&s;s in te&s;tifying again&s;t vice, and apprehended error! fearing the face of no man, while per&s;uaded in his own mind he was doing that, which would be acceptable in the &s;ight of God. He &s;hone with great bright|ne&s;s as a preacher, while in the full enjoyment of health and &s;trength. He was indeed a tho|rough divine. He had a general knowledge of mo&s;t of the learned arts; was a good gramma|rian, well acquainted both with latin and greek, e&s;pecially the new-te&s;tament greek, in which his critici&s;ms were frequent, and ju&s;t; and &s;uch, as if collected together, and placed in one view before the public, would give him an high repu|tation in the learned world. But he excelled in his knowledge of divinity. This was his principal &s;tudy; and he has left few who were equal to him.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="011207_0025_0F862C8683961B28">HE was, by bodily con&s;titution, liable to &s;ud|denne&s;s, which was heightned by the ill &s;tate of his health; but he made it his care to govern his re&s;entments, keeping them under the re|&s;traints of rea&s;on and religion. He was him&s;elf a &s;tranger to all the arts of intrigue and di&s;&s;imu|lation, and dete&s;ted them in others. His con|ver&s;ation was &s;erious, but not affected; plea&s;ant and affable, but not light and vain. He had a turn for &s;atyr, which he could expre&s;s with an emphatical air, but was always cautious that he did not needle&s;ly give offence.</P>
<P>HIS religion, though &s;piritual, was &s;ub&s;tanti|al; not tainted with &s;uper&s;tition, not made ridiculous by the influence of enthu&s;ia&s;m. He was, in the judgment of all who were acquaint|ed with him, a real good chri&s;tian; a partaker of the Holy Gho&s;t, and of that faith in the re|velations of God which purified his heart, wro't by love, and influenced his whole conduct in life. He was uniform and &s;teady in his walk with God, in the way of his commandments: though, in&s;tead of "tru&s;ting that he was righte|ous" in the eye of &s;trict law, he accounted him&s;elf an "unprofitable &s;ervant"; fixing his dependence, not on his own worthine&s;s, not on any works of righteou&s;ne&s;s which he had done, but on the mercy of God, and the atoning blood, and perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s, of Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Savior.</P>
<P>HE had upon his mind, for &s;ome time before
<PB N="28" REF="011207_0026_0F862C87237210F0">
his death, a prevailing apprehen&s;ion, that he &s;hould &s;oon go the way of all the earth; which he more than once &s;ignified to his children, and to a friend going a long journey, taking his final farewell and &s;aying, "She would &s;ee him no more". Whether it was from this apprehen&s;ion, or the general &s;ea&s;onablene&s;s of &s;peaking to his people upon &s;uch a &s;ubject I know not; but it may be worthy of notice, the four la&s;t Sermons he preached was from tho&s;e words, in the book of Job, "all the days of my appointed time I will wait, till my change comes." It may na|turally be &s;uppo&s;ed, he was, in &s;ome of the la&s;t weeks of his life, particularly thoughtful of the great change by death, and diligent in his pre|paration for it.</P>
<P>THE manner of God's calling him out of the world was &s;udden and violent. He was &s;o deep|ly &s;truck, as, in a few minutes, to be deprived both of his rea&s;on and his &s;en&s;es; and, in this lethargic &s;tate he continued about twenty eight hours, when he fell a&s;leep in Je&s;us; with whom, we tru&s;t, he is now pre&s;ent, in the paradi&s;e of God, re&s;ting from his labors, and enjoying the happi|ne&s;s that is proper to the "&s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect."</P>
<P>YOU, his dear relatives, I know, think thus concerning him; and while this is your faith, you can have no rea&s;on to "weep for him", however you may "weep for your &s;elves."</P>

Be thankful he was &s;o long continued to you, and that you enjoyed &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing in him.

May their be a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e, who &s;hall be eminently in&s;trumental in &s;erving the Redeemer's intere&s;t in the&s;e churches! Perhaps, there never was a town, in any part of the world, &s;ince the days of the apo&s;tles, more &s;ignally ble&s;&s;ed than this has been, from its beginning, with &s;kilful, able, faithful go&s;pel mini&s;ters. In&s;tead of tho&s;e that are gone, and going, off the &s;tage of life and action, may that God, with whom is the re&s;idue of the &s;pirit, rai&s;e up, and qualify, others to &s;upply their places, and to do more worthily for him in their day and generation!</P>
<P>IT were to be wi&s;hed, that both mini&s;ters and people would continually entertain in their minds the thought, that they dwell in weak feeble tabernacles, that will &s;hortly be broke to pieces by this or the other di&s;ea&s;e, or di&s;|a&s;ter, in the providential government of God.
<PB N="33" REF="011207_0032_0F862C8CA45B3C58">
Mini&s;ters would then preach, and their people would then hear, as becomes dying men. And &s;uch preaching, and &s;uch hearing, would, under the ble&s;&s;ing of God, be effec|tual to the &s;alvation of mini&s;ters them&s;elves, and tho&s;e that hear them.</P>
<P>NOW to the only living, unchangeable, immortal God, be given all glory, honor, maje&s;ty and Dominion, by the church of Chri&s;t, throughout all ages, in this world; and throughout eternity, in the coming one. AMEN and AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>Appendix. From the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Gazette,</HI> of June 22. 1769.</HEAD>
<P>LAST &s;aturday morning, the Reverend Mr. THOMAS FOXCROFT, &s;enior Pa&s;tor of the fir&s;t Church in this Town, was &s;uddenly &s;truck with a di&s;order, partly apo|plectic, partly pal&s;aic, which deprived him of his rea&s;on, locked up his &s;en&s;es, and put an end to his life the following day, about ele|ven of the clock, in the &s;eventy third year of his Age.</P>
<P>HE was born in Bo&s;ton, but in early child|hood became an inhabitant of Cambridge, the &s;eat of Harvard-College; where he was favored with as good an education as could be had in the country, in that day. This, toge|ther with the &s;uperior intellectual powers, the Father of &s;pirits was plea&s;ed to be&s;tow on them, laid the foundation for tho&s;e learned accom|pli&s;hments, which di&s;tingui&s;hed him from mo&s;t of his brethren in the mini&s;try. He took his degrees of Bachelor and Ma&s;ter of Arts in the years 1714, and 1717. His Father, FRANCIS FOXCROFT, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a Member of the Church of
<PB REF="011207_0034_0F862C8DEA6EFDC8">
England, tho' candid in his &s;entiments of other denominations of chri&s;tians, which he &s;ignified by &s;tatedly joining in wor&s;hip with the Congregational Church at Cambridge, where he re&s;ided, the remaining part of his life, after he left Bo&s;ton:&mdash;His Father in|tended he &s;hould be an Epi&s;copal Clergy|man. And this was his own intention, till, by diligent &s;tudy, and free conver&s;ation with that great Rea&s;oner, and eminently pious Man, the Rev. Mr. NEHEMIAH WALTER, (then Pa&s;tor of the Church at Roxbury, in which place he was called to be at the head of a Grammar-School for a few years,) he was obli|ged to think, that the mode of wor&s;hip and government in our Churches, was more agreeable to <HI>Scripture Rule</HI> than that of the Engli&s;h Church. In the year 1729, he publi&s;hed, in an&s;wer to "Mr. T. Barclay's Per&s;ua&s;ive," which had been di&s;tributed in New-England, his work entitled, "the <HI>ruling</HI> and <HI>ordaining</HI> Power of <HI>Congregati|onal Bi&s;hops,</HI> or <HI>Pre&s;byters</HI> defended;" in which he &s;hewed him&s;elf a ma&s;ter in this controver&s;y. The Power of <HI>Pre&s;byters,</HI> or <HI>Scripture Bi&s;hops</HI> to ordain and <HI>govern,</HI> is here &s;et in a &s;trong point of light: Few have wrote upon the &s;ubject with greater clearne&s;s, more accuracy, or ful|ler extent of knowledge. This highly valua|ble performance has received no an&s;wer to this day.</P>
<P>IN the Month of March, 1717, he was called to the pa&s;toral office of the fir&s;t Church in this Town, and on the 20th of Novem|ber following was ordained their Mini&s;ter in
<PB REF="011207_0035_0F862C8EAC622308">
partner&s;hip with the Rev. Mr. BENJAMIN WADSWORTH. Perhaps, no Mini&s;ter in Bo&s;ton, upon his fir&s;t &s;ettlement, was ever more uni|ver&s;ally admired. He was then held in high re|putation, as one of the be&s;t accompli&s;hed preachers; and this continued to be the ge|neral opinion of him, till there came on a change in the ta&s;te of people, and in the vigor of his con&s;titution by repeated di&s;or|ders of one kind or another. His publi&s;hed Sermons, upon a great variety of occa&s;ions, and in all the periods of his mini&s;terial life, will do honor to him as long as there are any capable judges of ju&s;tne&s;s of thought, copi|ou&s;ne&s;s of invention, elegance of &s;tile, &s;trength of rea&s;oning, enlivened with a &s;pirit of piety running through the whole. He was in &s;en|timent a &s;trict <HI>Calvani&s;t</HI>; though catholic in his di&s;po&s;ition towards others who did not think ju&s;t as he did. And, what ought to be men|tioned to his honor, he was no TRIMMER, but &s;teadily and uniformly adhered to the <HI>Calvinian</HI> principles, which he took to be the true Scripture ones; making them the chief &s;ubjects of his pulpit di&s;cour&s;es, as he thought he &s;hould hereby "plea&s;e God," if he did not always "plea&s;e Men." It may be ju&s;tly &s;aid of Mr. FOXCROFT, that he was a good &s;cholar, an able critick, both in Greek and Latin, and con&s;iderably acquainted with mo&s;t of the arts and &s;ciences; though Di|vinity was his favorite &s;tudy, in which he excelled; not having left many, if indeed any
<PB REF="011207_0036_0F862C8F7875BC40">
&s;uperior to him. But the be&s;t and greate&s;t thing that can be &s;aid of him is, that he was, as we have abundant rea&s;on to believe, a good chri&s;tian, and a faithful mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in who&s;e &s;ervice he labored, as a fixed pa&s;tor, nearly fifty-two years. He was called, in this period of time, to pa&s;s through a variety of trials, as well as &s;er|vices, which gave opportunity for the exer|ci&s;e and e&s;tabli&s;hment of many virtues, both private and &s;ocial, by which he honored God, did good in his generation, and was formed to a greater meetne&s;s for the enjoyment of the upper world, to which he was admit|ted, as we tru&s;t, of the free rich mercy of God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, at the day of his departure hence.</P>
<P>He has left behind a Son and five Daugh|ters, for whom we wi&s;h the guidance and ble&s;&s;ing of him who has &s;tiled him&s;elf "the father of the fatherle&s;s."</P>
<P>He was buried ye&s;terday with all decent re&s;pect; the Church to which he had long mini&s;tred bearing the expence of the funeral.</P>
