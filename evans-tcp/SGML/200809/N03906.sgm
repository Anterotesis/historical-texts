<P>Brethren, my Heart's De&s;ire and Prayer to God for I&s;rael is, that they might be &s;aved.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_AS we are fallen Creatures, and natu|rally in a lo&s;t, and peri&s;hing Condi|tion, the fir&s;t, and chief Thing that &s;hould be thought of by us, and that, which, (if we would act like rea|&s;onable Beings) ought in a Manner to &s;wallow up all our other Concerns, is; how, or whereby we may be &s;aved? But who is there of you, but mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that it is &s;omething el&s;e that takes up the Thoughts, and employs the Enquiries of a bui&s;y World; and that with too many this is the lea&s;t, and la&s;t of their Cares?</P>
<P>BUT then of tho&s;e that are not without all Man|ner of Anxiety as to their own Salvation, the Gene|rality of them appear to be too little concerned for the Salvation of the re&s;t of Mankind. Whereas tho' we are fir&s;t to look to our own Souls; the divine and heavenly Religion we profe&s;s, requires that we
<PB N="6" REF="004806_0004_100E29D556561BF0">
don't confine our Regards to our &s;elves, but extend them to others, and expre&s;s a ju&s;t Concern, not meer|ly for their pre&s;ent, but for their future and everla&s;t|ing Welfare. And accordingly the Words I have now read to you breath the true Spirit and Temper of it.</P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle having been &s;peaking of the Re|jection of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and the Calling of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and being about to di&s;cour&s;e farther upon the &s;ame Subject, lea&s;t what he had &s;aid, or might &s;ay, &s;hould &s;eem to proceed from any Di&s;affection to his Coun|trymen; he makes a &s;olemn Declaration of his un|feigned Love to them, and his deep Concern for them. Yea, &s;o great was the Regard he had for them, and &s;o &s;ollicitous was he for their Happine&s;s, that he was almo&s;t ready, and willing to forego his own for the &s;ake of it. As in the third Ver&s;e of the immediately preceeding Chapter, <HI>For I could wi&s;h that my &s;elf were accur&s;ed from Chri&s;t, for my Bre|thren, my Kin&s;men according to the Fle&s;h.</HI> If by wi&s;h|ing him&s;elf accur&s;ed from Chri&s;t, he means that he could be content to be cut off from the Land of the living, as an <HI>Anathema,</HI> or a devoted Per&s;on, and to be remov'd out of the World in a mo&s;t ignominious Manner, would it conduce to their Felicity. Or if he intends that he &s;hould be willing to be excom|municated from the Society of the Faithful, to be &s;eparated from their Communion, and even to be ac|counted as a Heathen Man, and a Publican. That if their be&s;t Intere&s;ts would be promoted by it, he could wi&s;h him&s;elf no more remembred among the Saints, and his Name blotted out of the Records of the Church: This is a &s;trong Evidence of his Affec|tion and Regard for them. But then there are &s;ome that carry the Expre&s;&s;ion higher, and &s;uppo&s;e that he here means his being really &s;eperated from Chri&s;t, and cut off from reaping any Benefit by him. But then they ju&s;tly ob&s;erve, that he does not &s;ay, I do
<PB N="7" REF="004806_0005_100E29D711E17BF0">
<HI>wi&s;h,</HI> but <HI>could wi&s;h my &s;elf accur&s;ed from Chri&s;t.</HI> As we are wont to &s;ay, when we would expre&s;s a Thing to the Heigth which is not fit, nor intended to be done by us: I could wi&s;h even &s;o, or &s;o: I could be content to do this, or that. So, when the Apo&s;tle thus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, they conceive it to be as much as if he had &s;aid, So great is my Concern for my Countrymen the <HI>Jews,</HI> that were it proper, and would it prevail to the procuring of their Salvation, I could be willing to undergo the greate&s;t of Evils, and almo&s;t to wi&s;h my own De&s;truction for the &s;ake of it. So that the Apo&s;tle may be con&s;ider'd as giving us the Sen&s;e of what he had before &s;aid, and as repeating much the &s;ame Thing, when he makes this &s;olemn Declaration, and &s;ays, <HI>My Heart's De&s;ire and Prayer to God for I&s;rael is, that they might be &s;aved.</HI></P>
<P>IN &s;peaking to the&s;e Words there are two Things that I would take Notice of, and briefly &s;ay &s;ome|thing to.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE va&s;t Worth and Importance of the Be|nefit, and Ble&s;&s;ing here &s;poken of, <HI>viz.</HI> The being &s;aved. And,</P>
<P N="2">II. THE vehement De&s;ire the Apo&s;tle had that others might be Partakers of it.</P>
<P N="1">I. I AM to take Notice of the va&s;t Worth, and Importance of the Benefit, and Ble&s;&s;ing here &s;poken of, <HI>viz.</HI> The being &s;aved. When the Apo&s;tle was about to give the &s;tronge&s;t and fulle&s;t Evidence that po&s;&s;ibly he could of his good Will to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation, how does he expre&s;s it, but by his De&s;ire that they might be &s;aved? Plainly intimating, that nothing el&s;e would be &s;o advantageous, or was of &s;o much Moment to them: And it is certainly of equal Importance to all. This being not the Thing that I had chiefly in View in di&s;cour&s;ing from the Words, I &s;hall &s;ay but little to it at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="004806_0006_100E29DCB6C70E58">BY the being &s;aved, I here mean the being &s;aved from the Wrath and Cur&s;e of God, and the Mi&s;eries con&s;equent upon it. This is what by the Sin of <HI>Adam,</HI> and our own actual Sin, we have fallen under. But as there is a Po&s;&s;ibility of Salvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, it is a Thing of the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence that we attain to it. It is of very great Importance to us that we be &s;aved at Death: That our Souls when they put off the&s;e Earthly Tabernacles, may be de|liver'd from falling into the Hands of Devils: That they may e&s;cape that Place and State of Torment that is prepared and re&s;erved for the &s;eparate Spirits of the Wicked, and go to a&s;&s;ociate with the pure and perfected Spirits of the Ju&s;t. And then it is of great Importance to us that we be &s;aved at the final Judgment, and general Di&s;&s;olution. We are told of a Day that is approaching when our <HI>Lord &s;hall de&s;cend from Heaven in flaming Fire to take Vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not his Go&s;pel:</HI> When <HI>the Heavens &s;hall pa&s;s away with a great Noi&s;e, and the Elements melt with fervent Heat; when the Earth, and the Works that are there|in &s;hall be burnt up.</HI> And if we look for &s;uch Things, mu&s;t it not be a Thing of great Concernment to every one, that when this Day of the Lord &s;hall come, they may be found of him in Peace? Will it not be a fearful Thing to be then di&s;owned and re|jected by him? O! What will become of you, when being doom'd to everla&s;ting Fire, you find your &s;elves &s;urrounded with mercile&s;s Flames, and being ca&s;t out of the Divine Protection, have no where to flee? How inconceivably wretched will be your Ca&s;e, when you find your &s;elves cut off from the Pro&s;pect of pre&s;ent Deliverance, and from any Hopes of future Relea&s;e?</P>
<P>OF what va&s;t Importance is it then now to pro|vide a Place of Refuge and Shelter again&s;t that great and terrible Day; that &s;o you may be accounted
<PB N="9" REF="004806_0007_100E29DF60726968">
worthy to e&s;cape the&s;e Things that &s;hall come to pa&s;s, and to &s;tand before the Son of Man? That whil&s;t others are ca&s;t into outer Darkne&s;s, and left to dwell with everla&s;ting Burnings, you may be caught up to the Heaven of Heavens, may take up your Re&s;idence with God, and ble&s;&s;ed Spirits in tho&s;e Realms of uninterrupted Light, and your Body and Soul be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of compleat and perfect Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s for ever and ever.</P>
<P>ALL this, and much more is included in the Salva|tion &s;poken of in the Text. It mu&s;t needs then be a rich and valuable Ble&s;&s;ing, and a Thing of the greate&s;t Importance to attain to it.</P>
<P>AND now if it be &s;o, why &s;hould we any of us wonder, and now can we think it &s;trange, that Per|&s;ons are &s;o deeply anxious as they &s;ometimes are, about their own Salvation? Such is the Importance of the Thing; &s;o much more difficult is it than many are aware of to attain to it; &s;o &s;trait is the Gate, and &s;o narrow the Way that leads to it, and &s;o few there be that find it: In a Word, &s;uch is the Danger of coming &s;hort of it, and &s;o di&s;mal the Thought of mi&s;carrying, and of being lo&s;t for ever, that there is not the lea&s;t Room to admire, that tho&s;e that are in the due Exerci&s;e of their Intellectual Powers &s;hould be under great Concern, and in deep Di&s;tre&s;s of Soul, till they have a good and comfortable Hope, and Pro&s;pect of it.</P>
<P>BUT on the other Hand, what Rea&s;on have we to &s;tand amazed at the Carele&s;ne&s;s and Security of the greater Part of Mankind? Were we to argue from the Behaviour of the Generality of the Sons and Daughters of Men, we &s;hould be apt to conclude that their Salvation was a Thing of but very little Con&s;e|quence, and be almo&s;t ready to think it a Matter of Indifferency to them, whether they are &s;aved, or whe|ther they are damned. They have commonly very fearful Apprehen&s;ions of Poverty and Contempt, and
<PB N="10" REF="004806_0008_100E29E38F7B8040">
the other Inconveniencies and Mi&s;chiefs they are liable to in this Life, and take a great deal of Pains to &s;ecure them&s;elves from them: But they &s;eem to be no ways afraid of Hell, or of the endle&s;s and inconcei|vable Mi&s;eries of another Life, and take hardly any Thought or Care that they may e&s;cape them. O! the lamentable Blindne&s;s and Stupidity of the Sons of Men. Wilt thou be plea&s;ed infinitely good God, to open their Eyes? Awaken their &s;leepy, dead Souls; &s;hew them the Dangers that &s;urround them; make them to &s;ee of what Importance it is to be &s;aved; and then they'll give all Diligence to work out their own Salvation; and not only &s;o, but will be doing all they can to promote the Salvation of all that are near to them. And &s;o I come to the</P>
<P N="2">II. Thing that I took Notice of, and am to &s;ay &s;omething to, from the Words, <HI>viz.</HI> The Apo|&s;tle's vehement De&s;ire that others might be Partakers of the great and important Ble&s;&s;ing he here &s;peaks of. <HI>Brethren,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>my Heart's De&s;ire and Prayer to God for I&s;rael is, that they might be &s;aved.</HI> And in &s;hewing him&s;elf thus earne&s;tly de&s;irous of the Sal|vation of others, he is to be con&s;ider'd as a Pattern to Chri&s;tians in all &s;ucceeding Ages, and as well wor|thy of their Imitation. We are all then to take Ex|ample from him in manife&s;ting our &s;elves earne&s;tly de&s;irous of the Salvation of others. And here I &s;hall &s;ay, 1&s;t, Who&s;e Salvation are we thus earne&s;tly to de&s;ire. 2. How and in what Way we are to manife&s;t our &s;elves de&s;irous of it. 3. Whence or upon what Account we are to do it: And then conclude with &s;ome proper U&s;e of the whole.</P>
<P>HERE then I am briefly to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. WHO they are who&s;e Salvation we are thus earne&s;tly to de&s;ire. And in general, we are to de&s;ire the Salvation of all, without excepting any of the whole humane Race.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="004806_0009_100E29E673F68938">GOD made of one Blood all Nations of Men for to dwell on the Face of the Earth. We had all one Father, and partake of one and the &s;ame Nature; and therefore however di&s;tingui&s;h'd into different Lan|guages or Religions, we are to be &s;ollicitous for the everla&s;ting Happine&s;s one of another. There are none of the Po&s;terity of <HI>Adam,</HI> of whatever Nation or Complexion, but may be &s;aid to be our Brethren; and therefore it &s;hould be our Heart's De&s;ire, if it were the Will of God, that they may be &s;aved: We are to de&s;ire with the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 67.2. <HI>That God's Way may be known in the Earth, and his &s;aving Health among all Nations.</HI> That they that are Stran|gers to the great Salvation that God reveals and offers in his Go&s;pel may be made acquainted with it. And that they that have the Overtures and Tenders of it, may accept of them and clo&s;e with them. And &s;o I proceed to &s;ay, that tho' we are to wi&s;h the Salva|tion of all, there are &s;ome who&s;e Salvation we are in a more e&s;pecial Manner to de&s;ire. And</P>
<P N="1">1. WE are e&s;pecially to de&s;ire the Salvation of tho&s;e that are not only of the &s;ame Nature, but of the &s;ame Faith and Religion with us.</P>
<P>BY tho&s;e of the &s;ame Religion with us, I don't here mean tho&s;e only that are exactly of the &s;ame Opinion, or of our own Party and Per&s;wa&s;ion; but all that own the &s;ame common Faith, that profe&s;s the &s;ame Chri&s;tian Doctrine; all that are of the Church or I&s;rael of God in general; all that as the Apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es it, in every Place call on the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord; both theirs, and ours; to whom he wi&s;hes Grace, Mercy, and Peace from God our Father, and from our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1&s;t Chap. 2d Ver&s;e. And thus far are we all oblig'd to extend our good and charitable Wi&s;hes; even to all our Chri&s;tian Brethren, however they may be divided into different Parties and Opinions, and
<PB N="12" REF="004806_0010_100E29E934A1F408">
di&s;tingui&s;h'd by various Denominations: It &s;hould be our Heart's De&s;ire concerning them all, that they may be &s;aved.</P>
<P>AGAIN, in the next Place, Chri&s;tians &s;hould yet more e&s;pecially wi&s;h this Ble&s;&s;ing to tho&s;e that are peculiarly near and dear to them, either on the Ac|count of the &s;pecial Relation they &s;tand in to them, or any Benefits they have conferred upon them. You are to be &s;ollicitous not only for the temporal, but for the &s;piritual and everla&s;ting Welfare of Hu&s;bands and Wives; of Parents and Children; of Brethren and Si&s;ters; of Benefactors and Friends that are as your own Souls. Brethren, it &s;hould be your Heart's De&s;ire for them that they may be &s;aved. You are indeed to wi&s;h well to the &s;piritual and eternal Inte|re&s;ts of Strangers, and even of Enemies; to ble&s;s them that cur&s;e you; to do good to them that hate you; to pray for them that de&s;pitefully u&s;e and per|&s;ecute you. But tho' your greate&s;t Per&s;ecutors, and bittere&s;t Enemies are not to be excluded from your kind Wi&s;hes, there is no Doubt but that your near Friends are peculiarly entitled to them.</P>
<P>AND then I may add once more, that Chri&s;tians &s;hould in a very peculiar Manner de&s;ire the Salvation of tho&s;e of their own immediate Hou&s;hold. If he that provides not for his own, e&s;pecially for tho&s;e of his own Hou&s;e, upon temporal Accounts, and takes no Care for the Supply of their bodily Wants, meets with &s;o &s;harp a Reproof from the Apo&s;tle, of how much &s;everer Cen&s;ure &s;hall he be thought worthy, who neglects their eternal Intere&s;ts, and cares not what becomes of their precious and immortal Souls. Whom|&s;oever they are that Providence brings into your Fa|milies and puts under your Care, be they bond or free, white or black, you are to be &s;ollicitous for their Souls Welfare, and to be heartily de&s;irous that they
<PB N="13" REF="004806_0011_100E29EC5936F4C0">
may be &s;aved. Having thus hinted to you who they are who&s;e Salvation we are earne&s;tly to de&s;ire, I pro|ceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">2. HOW and in what Way we are to manife&s;t our &s;elves de&s;irous of it. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. WE are to &s;hew our &s;elves heartily de&s;irous of the Salvation of others, by our fervent Prayers to God for it: This is agreeable to the Apo&s;tolick Pattern here in the Text; <HI>My Heart's De&s;ire,</HI> &s;ays this divine and in&s;pir'd Writer, he adds, and my <HI>Prayer to God for I&s;rael is, that they might be &s;aved.</HI> The &s;ame Apo&s;tle el&s;ewhere tells us, that it is the Will of God that Prayers and Interce&s;&s;ions as well as giving of Thanks &s;hould be made for all Men.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. ii. 1.</NOTE> Accordingly we are to pray for them that <HI>they may be &s;aved, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth.</HI> We are to beg of God that he would di&s;pel tho&s;e Clouds of Ignorance and Error that over&s;pread &s;o great a Part of the known World; that <HI>the Nations may be glad and &s;ing for Joy, and that all the Ends of the Earth may &s;ee the Salvation of God</HI>; that he would &s;end forth his Light and his Truth; that the Truth, even as it is in Je&s;us, may be embraced by all that profe&s;s his Name; and that all that own the &s;ame common Lord and Saviour, may &s;hare with us in his &s;aving Benefits.</P>
<P>BUT then we are to be peculiarly earne&s;t and fer|vent in our Prayers for the Salvation of &s;uch as fall under our more immediate Watch and Care; for &s;uch as &s;tand in any &s;pecial Relation, and for all that have been remarkably kind and beneficent to us. As we are e&s;pecially to de&s;ire the Salvation of &s;uch, &s;o I &s;ay we are with a peculiar Fervency to pray for it: We are to interceed with God for their temporal, but e&s;pe|cially for their eternal Welfare: We are to pray for them as the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> does for <HI>One&s;iphorus,</HI> who <HI>was not a&s;hamed of his Bonds, but when he was at Rome
<PB N="14" REF="004806_0012_100E29EE527F7940">
&s;ought him out diligently, found him, and oft refre&s;hed him: The Lord grant,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that he may find Mercy of the Lord in that Day,</HI> 2 Tim. 1.18. Thus &s;hould we expre&s;s our De&s;ires of the Salvation of others, by our fervent Prayers to God for it. And then,</P>
<P N="2">2. WE are to do this by our earne&s;t Endeavours to promote it. If the&s;e are wanting, our &s;eeming De&s;ires that they may be &s;aved are but an idle Pretence, and our Prayers nothing more than a vain and empty Shew. If we would make it evident that we heartily de&s;ire their Salvation, we mu&s;t do what we can as we have Opportunity for the Furtherance of it. It will become us to do all that is in our Power, that &s;uch as are de&s;titute of the appointed Means of Salva|tion, may be brought to the Enjoyment of them, and that tho&s;e that enjoy them, may reap the Benefit in|tended by them. We are particularly to endeavour the Salvation of &s;uch as come under our immediate View and Ob&s;ervation; e&s;pecially of tho&s;e we are any ways related to, or concerned with. Do we perceive them to be in the Gall of Bitterne&s;s and Bonds of Ini|quity, and apprehend that if they continue in their pre&s;ent State they are in the Way to Death and Hell, we are not to look upon them with Indifferency and Unconcernedne&s;s of Soul; nor barely to behold them with &s;omething of Compa&s;&s;ion and Concern, and &s;e|cretly to breath out a Wi&s;h on their Behalf; but to labour to convince them of their mi&s;erable and dange|rous E&s;tate, and do what we can that they may be converted and brought out of it: We are to endea|vour that they may be reclaim'd from their Errors of Practice, and al&s;o from their Errors of Judgment, which, tho' they are in a good Mea&s;ure recover'd from the former, may prove fatal to them: We are parti|cularly to do what we can to take them off from any mi&s;taken Notion they may be &s;ubject to, as to the Terms of their Acceptance with God: To put them
<PB N="15" REF="004806_0013_100E29F3F02FA1E0">
upon &s;eeking for Ju&s;tification only by Faith in the Son of God, by being found in him, and having on his Righteou&s;ne&s;s; and to guard them again&s;t tru&s;ting in their own Duties and Performances, which, without Doubt is, and has been the eternal undoing of a great many Souls. This the Text leads me particularly to take Notice of: It being the very Ca&s;e as to tho&s;e <HI>Jews</HI> for whom the Apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es &s;o much Con|cern; and therefore he adds in the very next Words, <HI>I bear them Record that they have a Zeal of God, but not according to Knowledge. For they being ignorant of God's Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and going about to e&s;tabli&s;h their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, have not &s;ubmitted them&s;elves unto the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God.</HI> They were very zealous for the Law, and for the ceremonial Ob&s;ervances of it; they were con&s;cientious and &s;crupulous in complying with them; and were &s;ome of them very exact and careful in their Morals: But here was their fatal Mi&s;|take, that they re&s;ted in the&s;e Things, and thought hereby to recommend them&s;elves to the Favour of God. And this it's to be feared is the Error of a great many profe&s;s'd Chri&s;tians at this Day: They have &s;ome &s;ort of Zeal for God, tho' not according to Knowledge: They make a con&s;iderable Stir with re|&s;pect to the Circum&s;tantials of Religion: They con|tend with a great deal of Warmth about outward Modes and Forms; &s;ome one Way, and others the Rever&s;e: They come before God as his People, and ob&s;erve all the &s;tated Sea&s;ons of his publick Wor&s;hip: They abound in external Performances, and are civi|liz'd in their Lives and Manners; and upon the&s;e Things they depend to procure them Acceptance with God. But if there be any of you that have no other Foundation for your Hope, it will a&s;&s;uredly <HI>be cut off, and your Tru&s;t be as the Spider's Web.</HI> Upon Enquiry you'll find that the Phari&s;ees did as much as this, and yet our Saviour expre&s;sly tells us, <HI>that our Righteou&s;|ne&s;s mu&s;t exceed the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Scribes and
<PB N="16" REF="004806_0014_100E29F6E289D3D0">
Phari&s;ees, or we &s;hall in no Ca&s;e enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>WE are therefore in endeavouring the Salvation of others, to do all we can to bring them to a humble Sen&s;e of the In&s;ufficiency of any Works or Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of their own; to put them upon a cordial Ac|ceptance of Chri&s;t, and an entire Reliance upon him, who, as the Apo&s;tle tells us in the Context, <HI>is the End of the Law for Righteou&s;ne&s;s to every one that be|lieveth.</HI></P>
<P>AND thus you have briefly heard how and in what Way we are to evidence and expre&s;s our De&s;ires of the Salvation of others. And &s;o I pa&s;s to the</P>
<P N="3">3d. THING propo&s;ed; which was to &s;ay, Whence or upon what Account we &s;hould do it. And to pa&s;s over this Head in two or three brief Hints, we &s;hould heartily de&s;ire and earne&s;tly endeavour the Salvation of others,</P>
<P N="1">1. OUT of Love to God, and from a Regard to his Glory, which is &s;o much concern'd in it. He is the mo&s;t amiable and excellent of Beings, and po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd of all imaginable Perfections con&s;ider'd in him|&s;elf: And how va&s;t has been his Bounty and Benefi|cence to us? He is the Author of our Beings; to him we are indebted for what we are, and for all that we have or hope for; He ought therefore to be the &s;upream Object of our Love, and con&s;equently his Glory &s;hould be our highe&s;t Aim, and what we &s;hould be ever &s;ollicitous to promote. And wherein is the Glory of God more advanced than in the Salvation of Sinners? As his infinite Wi&s;dom has pitch'd upon &s;uch a Way for the Accompli&s;hment of it, that it may be brought to pa&s;s without the lea&s;t Reproach to any one of his Attributes; &s;o his Mercy and Grace will be herein highly exalted, and un&s;peakable Ho|nour will redound to his Name. Since then the Glory
<PB N="17" REF="004806_0015_100E29FC61287AC8">
of God will be &s;o far promoted by the Salvation of others, upon this Account we &s;hould de&s;ire it, pray for it, and do all we can in order to it. Again,</P>
<P><HI>Nextly.</HI> We are heartily to de&s;ire and earne&s;tly to endeavour the Salvation of others in meer Love and Compa&s;&s;ion to them. One of the two great Com|mandments on which hang all the Law and the Pro|phets is, That <HI>we love the Lord our God with all our Heart, with all our Soul, our Strength, and Mind.</HI> And the other is, that we <HI>love our Neighbour as our &s;elves.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. 22.37, 38, 39.</NOTE> And if we have any real Affection for our Fellow-Creatures, if we have any Bowels and Mercies, when we look upon them as fallen from God, when we con&s;ider the &s;ad and unhappy State to which they are hereby reduc'd, and the amazing and never-ending Torments, which unle&s;s they are brought out of it, mu&s;t unavoidably be their Portion, we mu&s;t needs behold them with Compa&s;&s;ion, and it can't well chu&s;e but be our hearty De&s;ire, our fervent Prayer, and earne&s;t Endeavour that they may be &s;aved.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P>ONCE more. We are taught by a great many Scripture Precepts and Examples, to expre&s;s our hear|ty De&s;ires of the Salvation of others: It is included in the great Commandment before-mention'd, of <HI>loving our Neighbour as our &s;elves.</HI> The Scriptures are full of Injunctions to this Purpo&s;e. And then, how many excellent Patterns of this Nature are there exhibited to our View? Particularly we have the Example of JESUS the High Prie&s;t of our Profe&s;&s;ion to induce us to it. From whence was it but from a Regard to the Salvation of Men, that he came down from Heaven, that he was made Fle&s;h, and dwelt among us? And whil&s;t here, with what unwearied Diligence did he pro&s;ecute this great and noble De|&s;ign? And as he was content to live a mi&s;erable Life,
<PB N="18" REF="004806_0016_100E29FE0AC42A20">
he willingly &s;ubmitted to a &s;hameful and painful Death for the &s;ake of it. And then I might men|tion the Apo&s;tles of our Lord; particularly the great Apo&s;tle of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who&s;e Words I am di&s;cour|&s;ing from. How willing was he to &s;pend and be &s;pent for the Good of Souls? How ready to become all Things to all Men, if &s;o be he might &s;ave &s;ome? What Labours and Perils did he go through? How far was he from counting his Life dear to him, how freely did he part with the mo&s;t valuable of his temporal Intere&s;ts for the &s;ake of promoting the Cau&s;e in which he was engag'd? We &s;ee then that in de&s;iring and doing what we can to promote the Salvation of others, we imitate the greate&s;t and be&s;t Examples; and upon this Account it becomes us to do it.</P>
<P>HAVING thus briefly illu&s;trated and confirm'd the Ob&s;ervation here laid down, I proceed to make &s;ome U&s;e of it. 1. By way of In&s;truction. 2. Of Re|proof and Correction. And 3. Of Exhortation.</P>
<P N="1">I. WHAT has been &s;aid may be profitable for our In&s;truction. And we may hence learn &s;omething of the excellent and generous Nature of the Chri&s;tian Religion. So far is it from countenancing that Nar|rowne&s;s of Spirit that di&s;covers it&s;elf among &s;o many of its Profe&s;&s;ors, that nothing has a greater Tendency to ennoble Men's Minds, and to in&s;pire them with Largene&s;s of Heart. And when it is heartily em|brac'd, and has its due Influence, it teaches Men to look upon the Happine&s;s of others in a great Mea|&s;ure as their own, and as &s;uch, to wi&s;h it and &s;eek after it. Who that thinks of this Religion freely and without Prejudice, can chu&s;e but &s;ee it to be be|coming its ble&s;&s;ed Author, and like him, to be <HI>alto|gether lovely?</HI> The more clo&s;ely we view it, and the better we are acquainted with it, the more &s;en&s;ible we &s;hall be of its Charms, and the greater Beauties we &s;hall di&s;cover in it. How can we enough admire
<PB N="19" REF="004806_0017_100E2A011C3AAB58">
this holy and heavenly Doctrine, or be &s;ufficiently thankful for it? How much does it become us that profe&s;s it, to take Care that we don't deba&s;e and di&s;|honour it, but that by a becoming Temper and Be|haviour we exhibit the Amiablene&s;s and Excellency of it? And then,</P>
<P N="2">II. WHAT has been now offered may be profita|ble for Reproof and Correction: And that as to &s;everal Sorts of Per&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1. THEY mu&s;t needs &s;tand corrected, and de&s;erve very &s;everely to be rebuked, who in&s;tead of wi&s;hing the Salvation of others, are imprecating the contrary upon them. And how many &s;uch are there even among tho&s;e that wear the Chri&s;tian Name? How many, who with the &s;ame Mouth, wherewith <HI>they are,</HI> or &s;hould be <HI>ble&s;&s;ing God, even the Father, are cur&s;ing Men made after the Similitude of God,</HI> and cal|ling upon him to damn them for ever? How can we chu&s;e but &s;tand amazed, that any who &s;u&s;tain the Character of rational Beings, e&s;pecially who profe&s;s them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, &s;hould &s;uffer &s;uch horrid Lan|guage to proceed out of their Mouths? Certainly when they thus expre&s;s them&s;elves, they are not aware of what Damnation means, nor do they con&s;ider what they &s;ay. But this is far from being a &s;ufficient Ex|cu&s;e, that when they make u&s;e of the&s;e Terms, they don't fix any Ideas to them, and that they don't in|tend what the Words import in the &s;trict and literal Acceptation of them. Mu&s;t it not be highly affron|tive to the Divine Maje&s;ty for any thus &s;olemnly to invoke him upon the&s;e Occa&s;ions, and then to pre|tend that they have no Meaning in it? Is it not a vile Pro&s;titution and horrid Abu&s;e of the great and terrible Name which the Angels &s;o highly reverence and adore, and at which the very Devils can't forbear trembling, for Per&s;ons to to&s;s it about in their com|mon
<PB N="20" REF="004806_0018_100E2A042144D880">
and ordinary Conver&s;e, to no other Purpo&s;e but to fill up the Vacancies of their idle Di&s;cour&s;e? Is it not a direct Violation of the Letter of his Law, and a horrid Contempt and bold Defiance of his Ven|geance? And be&s;ides at the Time of their uttering this inhuman Language, their helli&s;h Pa&s;&s;ions are &s;ometimes rai&s;ed to that Heigth, that was it in their Power they would willingly inflict the wor&s;t of Mi&s;e|ries upon tho&s;e that are the Objects of their Rage. All then that allow them&s;elves in this profane Cur|&s;ing, mu&s;t needs be highly worthy of Rebuke. And then,</P>
<P>NEXTLY, They likewi&s;e fall under Cen&s;ure, and are ju&s;tly liable to a Reproof, who are one Way or other a Means of ob&s;tructing the Salvation of others, which it may be feared is the Ca&s;e with too many profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians at this Day. Men's wicked and profane Imprecations upon others, have no direct Tendency to ob&s;truct their Salvation, tho' without a deep Repentance they'll be a Bar to their own. Their wi&s;hing one's Mi&s;ery and De&s;truction will be no ways conducive to it: <HI>For as the Bird by wan|dring, and the Swallow by flying, &s;o the Cur&s;e cau&s;ele&s;s &s;hall not come,</HI> Prov. 26.2. But there are many other Ways whereby Men may be in&s;trumental of each other's Ruin, and are often a Means of leading one another into tho&s;e Practices that not only prove pernicious in this World, but i&s;&s;ue in their everla&s;ting Mi&s;ery and Perdition in the next. But how directly contrary is this to the true Spirit and Temper of a Chri&s;tian, and what a &s;ad Account will they have to give up when their Lord &s;hall come and reckon with them? Should any of you be found thus guilty, how will you be able to acquit your &s;elves from the Blood of tho&s;e who by your bad Coun&s;els, ill Examples, or any other Ways, you have help'd forward in the Way to Ruin? What will you do, when not only
<PB N="21" REF="004806_0019_100E2A07A01DFC20">
God and your own Con&s;ciences &s;hall accu&s;e and con|demn you, but when this and that Per&s;on &s;hall ri&s;e up in Judgment again&s;t you; yea, it may be &s;ome that were nearly related to you, perhaps the Children of your own Bowels, and lay their eternal Ruin to your Charge? How fearfully will this add to your Account, aggravate your Doom, and enhan&s;e your Mi&s;ery for ever? And then,</P>
<P>ONCE more, They are worthy of Reproof, who if they do nothing that has a direct Tendency to ob&s;truct the Salvation of others, are yet carele&s;s and indifferent about it, and unconcern'd what becomes of them for ever. And this &s;eems to be too generally the Ca&s;e with tho&s;e that call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians at this Day. They are too much of the Spirit and Temper of <HI>Cain:</HI> If Actions &s;peak as they certainly do, we can't but hear one and another of them &s;aying as he does, <HI>Gen.</HI> 4.9. <HI>Am I my Brother's keeper?</HI> Is it any thing to me what becomes of him? They &s;eldom, if ever, look beyond them&s;elves; they take but little Thought for the temporal, and le&s;s for the &s;piritual and eternal Good of their Neighbour; it &s;eems to be much the &s;ame Thing to them whither he be &s;av'd, or whether he peri&s;h; whether he be happy, or whether he be mi&s;erable for ever. But &s;uch are certainly of a very different Di&s;po&s;ition from that which the Apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es here in the Text: They are void of that Compa&s;&s;ion which the Reli|gion they profe&s;s &s;o &s;trongly recommends, are Stran|gers to the Power of it, and very ju&s;tly fall under Cen&s;ure. And then a</P>
<P N="3">III. and la&s;t U&s;e of what has been &s;aid is by Way of Exhortation. 1. If you have not yet done it, to &s;ecure your own Salvation. And 2. To expre&s;s a &s;incere and hearty Concern for the Salvation of others.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="004806_0020_100E2648C21D2728">IN the fir&s;t Place, my beloved Brethren, let me earne&s;tly exhort you, if you have not yet &s;ecur'd your own Salvation, that you would now exert your &s;elves in order to it. And here I would fir&s;t, offer a Word or two to &s;uch as are yet &s;o &s;en&s;ele&s;s and &s;tupid as to take little or no Thought or Care that you may be &s;aved. And let me a&s;k &s;uch of you, how you can po&s;&s;ibly be ea&s;y in a natural State, and what it is that encourages you in your pre&s;ent Secu|rity? Do you not think your Salvation a Thing of any Importance, and that it is worthy of your Con|cern? Do but think &s;eriou&s;ly what mu&s;t be the Con|&s;equence of coming &s;hort of it, and what it is to un|dergo the Damnation of Hell, and you'll &s;oon be convinced of the contrary, and &s;ee all your other In|tere&s;ts to be but perfect Trifles, and to vani&s;h into nothing, when compar'd with it. Or do you think it is a Thing &s;o ea&s;ily obtain'd, that there is no great Care or Pains requir'd in order to it? Do but im|partially &s;urvey the Scriptures from fir&s;t to la&s;t, and you'll find it to be a Mi&s;take. Nay, if you do no|thing more than con&s;ult the Words of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour him&s;elf, you'll be convinced that you have a great deal to do in order to your being &s;aved: That if you ever enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, you mu&s;t pre&s;s and force your Way into it; and that there is great Hazard of your coming &s;hort of it. Or is this the Ground of your Security, that it is Time enough to &s;et about this Bu&s;ine&s;s as yet, and that you may &s;afely put it off till hereafter? O that you would think &s;eriou&s;ly of your own Frailty, and con&s;ider how &s;oon your Time of Life, or Day of Grace may come to an End, and from hence you'll &s;oon &s;ee your Error. Is there any one of you that enjoys the mo&s;t confirm'd State of Health, or that is flouri&s;hing in the Vigour of Youth, who can tell but this Night his Soul may be requir'd of him; and but that before another Day his Opportunity of &s;ecu|ring

his Salvation may be at an End? What meane&s;t thou then, O Sleeper, ari&s;e and call upon thy God? O that all of you, young and old, or in the mid&s;t of your Days, would awake out of your Stupidity; that you would now re&s;olve, with a humble Dependance upon God's Grace, to be more concern'd for your Souls than you have ever yet been. <HI>Work out your own Salvation with Fear and Trembling, for it is God that worketh in you to will and to do of his good Plea|&s;ure.</HI> As it is now a Time when a great many are under a &s;erious and deep Concern for their Souls, one would think you &s;hould be afraid of mi&s;&s;ing this Sea&s;on, le&s;t you be left in your Security and be lo&s;t for ever. I would hope there are none here pre|&s;ent that &s;coff at this Work of Conviction, or that make Light of it. If they do, it is becau&s;e they are unacquainted with the Scriptures, and with the u&s;ual Way of Sinners being brought home to God. Con|&s;ider how tho&s;e that were converted by the Mini&s;try of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> were fir&s;t pricked at the Heart, and in the deepe&s;t Agony cried out, <HI>Men and Bre|thren, what &s;hall we do.</HI> Con&s;ider how it was with the Jaylor that came trembling to <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI>; and how it was with the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> him&s;elf, who trembled and cried out, <HI>What wilt thou have me to do?</HI> And con&s;ider what our Saviour him&s;elf &s;ays of the Office of the Holy Spirit, that when he was come he &s;hould <HI>reprove,</HI> or convince <HI>the World of Sin.</HI> And how is it po&s;&s;ible you &s;hould think &s;trange of this Work? And whoever of you expect Salva|tion without experiencing &s;ome Degree or other of it, you will doubtle&s;s find your &s;elves deceived. But then I would offer a Word or two to &s;uch of you as are under a deep and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Concern for your Souls, (which I tru&s;t is the Ca&s;e with &s;ome of you) who are full of trembling, and are ready with the Jaylor before mentioned to cry out, <HI>What &s;hall</HI> we <HI>do to be &s;aved?</HI> And how can I better reply than
<PB N="24" REF="004806_0022_100E2A10A6CE3058">
in the Words of the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Believe in the Lord Je&s;us, and you &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI> He calls upon you to come to him for Life and Salvation; and what is it that prevents your coming? Is it becau&s;e your Sins have been &s;o many and great? If you are but truly &s;en|&s;ible of them, this need be no Hindrance to it; No, if you are weary and heavy laden, you are the very Per&s;ons he invites to come, and whom he expre&s;ly promi&s;es upon your &s;o doing, that you &s;hall find Re&s;t for your Souls. Come then to him as your only and almighty Saviour, and don't cea&s;e &s;eeking and pray|ing till you have &s;uch a Sight of his &s;uitablene&s;s and &s;ufficiency, as heartily to embrace him, and to venture your Souls in his Hands: Then being found in him you'll be &s;afe and &s;ecure. And then,</P>
<P N="2">2. LET me exhort and per&s;wade you, having &s;e|cur'd your own Salvation, to expre&s;s a &s;incere and hearty De&s;ire for the Salvation of others. Be much in Prayer to God for it, and not only &s;o, but be &s;ure to u&s;e your be&s;t Endeavours to promote it. There are doubtle&s;s &s;ome who&s;e Happine&s;s ought to be very near your Heart. This as has been hinted to you, is the Ca&s;e of all that &s;tand in any near Relation to you; accordingly be exhorted in an e&s;pecial Manner to lay out your &s;elves for the Salvation of &s;uch. Be particularly &s;ollicitous for tho&s;e of your own Hou&s;e|hould. Let not tho&s;e that &s;erve with you, no not your poor Negroes, be excluded from your Care, but be mindful of their poor peri&s;hing Souls, and do what you can for them, that they may be &s;aved. But let your dear Children be in a peculiar Manner the Object of your Cares. As it mu&s;t needs be your De&s;ire and Prayer, &s;o let it be your earne&s;t Endea|vour, that they may not be lo&s;t, but &s;av'd for ever.

may and ought to begin at Home, don't let it end there, but extend it to all your Chri&s;tian Brethren, and even to the whole humane Race, and endeavour to promote the Salvation of all that come within your Reach. You have, Brethren, the Love of God, of Chri&s;t, and of your Neighbour to con&s;train you, and a great many excellent Examples to induce you to it. Yea, you have the Example of no le&s;s a Per&s;on than the Son of God him&s;elf, of the Apo&s;tles and primitive Chri&s;tians, and a great many noble Patterns of a later Date. What was it but an ardent De&s;ire of promoting the Salvation of precious and immortal Souls that induced that faithful Servant of Chri&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Rev Mr. Gilbert <HI>Tenvent.</HI></NOTE> that vi&s;ited &s;ome of our Towns the Winter pa&s;t to face the&s;e Northern Bla&s;ts, to undertake &s;uch a Jour|ney, and to go through &s;uch Fatigues in that difficult Sea&s;on? And as his coming into the&s;e Parts was owing to a Motion of Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> I can't but &s;peak of him as a bright and &s;hining Pattern of Zeal for the Salvation of Souls. Had he con&s;ulted his Ea&s;e, or had Wealth and Preferment been his Aim, it's ea&s;y to conceive how he could quickly have made his Way to the&s;e Things: But he took a Cour&s;e that he might be &s;ure would be a Bar to his Attainment to them, and that was no likely Way to procure him the Applau&s;e of any but the &s;erious and &s;trictly reli|gious, which are by far the &s;maller Part of Man|kind. But the Salvation of Souls was infinitely dearer to him, and this is the Thing that he was de&s;irous at all Hazards to promote. And how won|derful is it to &s;ee one in that Age with &s;uch burn|ing Zeal and unwearied Diligence pro&s;ecuting this great De&s;ign, and how glorious is the Sight? Did we &s;ee one in the prime of his Days freely ventu|ring his Life and Fortune, and facing the greate&s;t

Dangers to re&s;cue his Countrymen from the Ravages of a potent Adver&s;ary, and to deliver them from the temporal Mi&s;chiefs and Mi&s;eries which upon that Account they lay open to, it would doubtle&s;s gain our Admiration and E&s;teem. How much more &s;hould it do &s;o, to &s;ee an intrepid Youth voluntarily engaging in the War betwixt <HI>Michael</HI> and the Dra|gon, to &s;ee him boldly attacking this grand Adver|&s;ary in his &s;trong Holds, and expo&s;ing him&s;elf to a continual Scene of Labours and Perils, to re&s;cue poor Souls out of his Hands, to &s;ave them from Hell, and to prevent them from being bound in Chains of ever|la&s;ting Darkne&s;s? However it may be look'd upon by Men, it is I am well a&s;&s;ur'd a gracious Spectacle in the Sight of GOD and of the ble&s;&s;ed Angels. Let us then be thankful for the Examples that have been &s;et us by the&s;e Servants of CHRIST, and in|&s;tead of di&s;covering &s;o ba&s;e and envious a Di&s;po&s;ition as to take any Pains to find out their Failings, and magnify their Imperfections, let us ob&s;erve and emu|late their Vertues; and if we can't come up to them, let us follow them, tho' it be at &s;ome Di&s;tance, in their fervent De&s;ires and earne&s;t Endeavours to further the Salvation of others. Let us not only be careful to avoid every Thing that may ob&s;truct it, but do every Thing within our Power that may be conducive to it. It's certain we can't be employ'd in a Work more noble and honourable in it&s;elf, or that will be more advantageous to us; that will yield us greater Satisfaction in this World, or procure us a higher Degree of Glory in the next. <HI>They that be wi&s;e,</HI> &s;ays the Prophet, <HI>&s;hall &s;hine as the Bright|ne&s;s of the Firmament, and they that turn many to Righteou&s;ne&s;s as the Stars for ever and ever.</HI></P>
<P>LET us all then lay out our &s;elves in this Work, and let us be quicken'd to Diligence in it, by con|&s;idering
