<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORDS and GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER the many excellent Sermons that have been preached and pu|bli&s;hed by the members of your body, on the Propagation of <HI>Chri&s;t'</HI>s re|ligion, through the untutored parts of the earth, the pre&s;ent publication may be thought to argue &s;ome degree of pre|&s;umption. And this con&s;ideration, added to the difficulty of &s;aying any thing new or intere&s;ting, on a &s;ubject &s;o fully handled by many of the brighte&s;t ornaments of our

church, would have deterred the author from letting the <HI>fir&s;t Part</HI> of this Di&s;cour&s;e appear in print; if, on the other hand, he had not been encouraged therein, by the expre&s;s de&s;ire of his brethren who heard it, and the Hopes that his &s;ituation in <HI>America</HI> may have enabled him to place &s;ome particular points in a light, perhaps, &s;omewhat new.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to the <HI>&s;econd Part,</HI> it may be thought a very needle&s;s labour to attempt a proof&mdash;That the intere&s;ts of Chri&s;tianity will be advanced, by pro|moting the intere&s;ts of Science. But it hath been the author's misfortune, in his en|deavours for the latter, to meet with men, who &s;eeming to con&s;ider the advance|ment of Knowlege and <HI>free</HI> Enquiry as unfriendly to their illiberal Sy&s;tem, have &s;et them&s;elves up, with rage almo&s;t <HI>Gothic,</HI> to &s;tiffle the infant Sciences here. For this rea&s;on, he thought he could not do a better

And if, in the pro&s;ecution of this de&s;ign, he hath been led into a more particular Analy&s;is of the &s;ciences than &s;ome may judge needful in a di&s;cour&s;e of this kind, he hopes the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e will be his plea.</P>
<P>HE cannot conclude without taking this opportunity of expre&s;&s;ing his gratitude to the venerable &s;ociety in general, for the honor done him by their body; and to &s;undry illu&s;trious Members in particular for the countenance and protection &s;hewn him, at a time when their countenance and protection &s;tood him in much &s;tead.</P>

<P>"IF you would make the &s;oul of man great and good (&s;ays a &s;ublime<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Burnet in his Theory.</NOTE> writer) give her large and exten&s;ive pro&s;pects of the immen&s;ity of God's works, and of his inexhau&s;ted Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s."</P>
<P>NOW, tho&s;e divine attributes of Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s are no where more gloriou&s;ly di&s;played than in the Go&s;pel-di&s;pen&s;ation, and in tho&s;e marvellous Revolutions and Workings of Pro|vidence, which the Almighty has performed, and will yet perform, for the Salvation of mankind, and the final exten&s;ion of his Son's kingdom to the ends of the earth.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="008737_0008_1030A447F44BF468">
WELCOME, therefore, thrice welcome the holy Scriptures, tho&s;e living oracles of God, which can lend a clue to our meditations, and conduct them, by divine Grace, thro' the&s;e awfully improving &s;ubjects. Here is the "My&s;tery which was hid from ages and from generations, but which God at length manife&s;ted to his Saints, with a promi&s;e that the riches of the glory thereof &s;hould be made known among the Gentiles."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Colo&s;&s;ians i. 26, 27.</NOTE></P>
<P>THIS latter part of the Go&s;pel-di&s;pen&s;ation, which relates to the final conver&s;ion of the Gentiles, even <HI>to the uttermost parts of the earth,</HI> is that which, by the words of my text, and the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion of our meeting, I am more immediately led to con&s;ider. And, in doing this, I &s;hall, by divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, pur&s;ue the following Method.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> I SHALL endeavour to &s;hew, from the general voice of Prophecy&mdash;That it is the gracious purpo&s;e of God, in his own good time, to bring the Heathen around us to the knowlege of his ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pel, thro' the grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I SHALL make &s;ome remarks on the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of things on this continent with re&s;pect to the Go&s;pel-oeconomy, and the probability of a &s;peedy accompli&s;hment of the Prophecies which relate to the final conver&s;ion of the nations.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="008737_0009_1030A44ADFBFCEC0">
<HI>Lastly,</HI> FROM this view of things, I &s;hall offer an humble Addre&s;s to you, my Brethren, who are employed as in&s;truments in the hand of God for carrying on this great work of Conver&s;ion, by the Preaching of the Go&s;pel in places that heretofore "&s;at in darkne&s;s and the &s;hadow of death!"</P>
<P>YOU &s;ee here, what a large field is opened; and would to God that I were endued with gifts and powers &s;ufficient to acquit my&s;elf therein agreeable to your expectations. But I know the va&s;t, the glorious importance of the &s;ubjects propo&s;ed; and I feel my own weakne&s;s. I be&s;eech you, therefore, to &s;end forth your prayers for me to the throne of grace, that the&s;e &s;ubjects may not &s;uffer in my hands; and that I may be enabled to &s;peak as becomes one called to the pre&s;ent office.</P>
<P>I AM, in the <HI>First place,</HI> then, to con&s;ider the general voice of prophecy, with re&s;pect to the Conver&s;ion of the Heathen around us. And among many other illu&s;trious predictions of this event, the words of my text, and the ver&s;es preceeding it, are full and &s;trong.</P>
<P>"WHY do the Heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?&mdash;Yet have I &s;et my king upon my holy hill of Sion.&mdash;Thou art my &s;on; this day have I begotten thee. A&s;k of me, and I &s;hall give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance,
<PB N="4" REF="008737_0010_1030A44E23A9EDB8">
and the uttermo&s;t parts of the earth for thy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion." The meaning of which is, according to all the commentators&mdash;</P>
<P>THOU art my &s;on Je&s;us! This day have I anointed thee king over all the world, which thou ha&s;t purpo&s;ed to <HI>redeem.</HI> Go on; compleat the great eternal &s;cheme, and thereby e&s;tabli&s;h for thy&s;elf a kingdom of everla&s;ting holine&s;s. In vain &s;hall the nations rage. In vain &s;hall their proud leaders, Herod, Pontius Pilate, the Phari&s;ees and rulers of I&s;rael, combine them&s;elves again&s;t thee. In vain &s;hall they &s;eek to dethrone thee, to cut thee off from the earth, and to cru&s;h thy kingdom in its birth. My eternal purpo&s;es are fixed. The right hand of my power &s;hall be thy &s;trength and guide. It &s;hall defeat all the machinations of thy enemies, and rai&s;e thee even from the habitations of the dead, to thine inheritance in the man&s;ions of glory. There &s;halt thou dwell for ever, and whatever thou &s;halt a&s;k of me thou &s;halt receive, till the Heathen become thine inheritance, and the very ends of the earth thy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>HEREIN we &s;ee a mo&s;t &s;triking Prediction concerning the propagation and final exten&s;ion of Chri&s;t's kingdom to the very remote&s;t nations of the world. And indeed there is a beautiful
<PB N="5" REF="008737_0011_1030A4511129D838">
harmony among all the prophetic writers, relative to the &s;ame event.</P>
<P>THE venerable Patriarch Jacob, in ble&s;&s;ing his &s;on Judah, gives an early intimation thereof; and tells him that the &s;ceptre &s;hould not depart from his family till the immortal SHILOH &s;hould come, who was to erect an everla&s;ting kingdom, unto <HI>whom</HI> the <HI>gathering of the people was to be.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gene&s;is xlix. 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT of all the Prophetic writers, the &s;ublime I&s;aiah &s;eems to have been favored with the fulle&s;t view of the Go&s;pel-&s;tate, from the very birth of the Me&s;&s;iah to that glorious period, whereof we are now &s;peaking, when the "kingdoms of this world &s;hall become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chri&s;t." For this rea&s;on he has been called the Evangelical prophet, and has delivered many noble predictions concerning the exten&s;ion of the Go&s;pel, and the final conver&s;ion of the nations.</P>
<P>"THE<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah xi. 9. 10.</NOTE> earth, &s;ays he, in a language peculiarly &s;triking and emphatical, &s;hall be full of the knowlege of the Lord as the waters cover the &s;ea. And in that day there &s;hall be a root of Je&s;&s;e which &s;hall &s;tand for an en&s;ign of the people; to it &s;hall the Gentiles &s;eek, and his re&s;t &s;hall be glorious."</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="008737_0012_1030A453F94B7718">
AND again the &s;pirit of God, &s;peaking by the &s;ame Prophet concerning the Me&s;&s;iah &s;ays, "It<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chapter xlix. 6.</NOTE> is a light thing for thee, [or a &s;mall part of thy undertaking] that Thou [the &s;aviour of the world] &s;hould&s;t be my &s;ervant to rai&s;e up the tribes of Jacob, and to re&s;tore the pre&s;erved of I&s;rael. I will al&s;o give thee for a light to the GENTILES, that <HI>thou mayest be my &s;alvation unto the end of the earth."</HI></P>
<P>INDEED, the la&s;t chapters of this book are only one continued prediction of this period, and the glorious circum&s;tances attending it.</P>
<P>"I AM found, &s;ays he, of them that &s;ought me not. I &s;aid, behold me, behold me to a nation that was not called by my name.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chapter lxv. 1.</NOTE>"</P>
<P>NAY he even gives a Geographical divi&s;ion of the quarters of the world that were to receive the Go&s;pel, wherein he has included the whole Four.</P>
<P>"I WILL &s;end tho&s;e that e&s;cape of them, &s;ays he, to Tar&s;hi&s;h, Pul and Lud that draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the I&s;les afar off that have not heard my fame nor &s;een my glory; and they &s;hall declare my glory among the Gentiles.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chapter lxvi. 19.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now, according to our learned Commentators, Tar&s;hi&s;h denotes the <HI>East,</HI> Pul and Lud the
<PB N="7" REF="008737_0013_1030A4571F8E27D0">
<HI>South,</HI> Tubal and Javan the <HI>North,</HI> and the I&s;les the <HI>West.</HI> For, in holy &s;cripture, the I&s;les, the Sea, and the We&s;t are frequently put for one another; &s;o that "the i&s;lands afar off which have not heard of God's fame, nor &s;een his glory," may well be under&s;tood to comprehend this <HI>American</HI> continent, or <HI>West-Indies</HI> generally &s;o called, as the learned Dr. <HI>Lowth</HI> has ob&s;erved in his accurate commentary upon this pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>To the &s;ame purpo&s;e &s;peaks the prophet Jeremiah, in his &s;ixteenth chapter. Intending to reproach the Jews for their ab&s;urdity in apo&s;tatizing from the true God, after they had once known him, he tells them that, to their great di&s;grace, a time would come when the very Heathen them&s;elves, who had never heard the name of God, would come to him even from the <HI>uttermost parts of the earth;</HI> and confe&s;s that the gods which they had wor&s;hipped were no gods at all, but that they and their fathers had inherited Lies from the beginning, and put their tru&s;t in things that profited not.</P>
<P>"O<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jeremiah xvi. 19. 20.</NOTE> Lord, my &s;trength and my fortre&s;s and my refuge in the day of affliction; the <HI>Gentiles</HI> &s;hall come unto thee from the <HI>ends of the earth,</HI> and &s;hall &s;ay, Surely our fathers have inherited
<PB N="8" REF="008737_0014_1030A45A1A9C35C8">
lies and vanity, and things wherein there is no profit. Shall a man make gods unto him&s;elf, and they are no gods?"</P>
<P>LET us hear al&s;o the prophet Daniel.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Daniel ii. 44.</NOTE> "The Lord God of heaven &s;hall &s;et up a kingdom which &s;hall break in pieces and con&s;ume all tho&s;e kingdoms (i. e. the four monarchies) and it &s;hall &s;tand for ever and ever.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">vii. 13, 14.</NOTE> Behold, one like the &s;on of man came with the clouds of heaven, and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people and nations and languages &s;hould &s;erve him."</P>
<P>IN like manner &s;peaks Malachi. "From<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Malachi i. 11.</NOTE> the Ri&s;ing of the Sun to the Going-down of the &s;ame, my name &s;hall be great among the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> and in every place incen&s;e &s;hall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering; for my name &s;hall be great among the Heathen." All which is confirmed, with the utmo&s;t &s;olemnity by the angel's &s;ound in the revelation, and the great voices from heaven, declaring&mdash;</P>
<P>"THAT the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chri&s;t, and he &s;hall reign for ever and ever."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Rev. xi. 15.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now, although the&s;e Prophecies may, in part, have had their completion, by the va&s;t rapidity
<PB N="9" REF="008737_0015_1030A45D06383190">
with which the Go&s;pel &s;pread it&s;elf into almo&s;t every known corner of the old world, &s;oon after our SAVIOUR's A&s;cen&s;ion into heaven, yet, methinks, it is impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould ever have their full accompli&s;hment without the conver&s;ion of the Indian Natives around us, and the propagation of Chri&s;t's kingdom to the remote&s;t parts of this continent. We have many of the &s;tronge&s;t arguments to induce this belief. For, in the fir&s;t place, none of the&s;e Texts, which I have read, put any &s;horter limit to the &s;preading of the Go&s;pel than the Ends of the Earth, and from the Ri&s;ing of the Sun to the Going-down of the &s;ame. And &s;econdly our Saviour him&s;elf, that la&s;t and greate&s;t of all the Prophets, has expre&s;ly told us that "Jeru&s;alem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xxi. 22.</NOTE> &s;hall be trodden down of the Gentiles, till the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled." Now Jeru&s;alem is &s;till trodden down by the Gentiles, and<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Newton's Di&s;&s;ertations N^o. XX.</NOTE> con&s;equently their times are not yet fulfilled.</P>
<P>WE believe, therefore, on the mo&s;t &s;olid principles, that there is re&s;erved by Providence &s;ome future period or cri&s;is in the Go&s;pel-oeconomy, for a more remarkable and final <HI>fulfilling of the Gentiles, even to the ends of the earth;</HI> and that it is the great and gracious purpo&s;e of
<PB N="10" REF="008737_0016_1030A460380527F0">
God, in that day, to manife&s;t him&s;elf to the 'Heathen around us, and bring them to the knowlege of his ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pel, thro' the grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t;" which was the fir&s;t thing I propo&s;ed to &s;hew.</P>
<P>BUT here Infidelity u&s;ually urges the following que&s;tions, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>IF &s;uch be the intention of God, and &s;o great the efficacy of his Go&s;pel; what mu&s;t become of tho&s;e who have &s;at &s;o long in darkne&s;s and the &s;hadow of death? And why does he &s;o long delay the accompli&s;hment of his own eternal promi&s;es?</P>
<P>REVERENCE to the &s;upreme Lord of heaven and earth, it might have been hoped, would have &s;ecured the advocates of the Chri&s;tian Revelation again&s;t que&s;tions of &s;uch high pre&s;umption. For who &s;hall &s;ay unto the Almighty, what do&s;t thou? Or what man, of mortal de&s;cent, &s;hall hope to unfold tho&s;e &s;ecret rea&s;ons of divine conduct, which eternal wi&s;dom hath not thought fit to reveal?</P>
<P>AS for us, we &s;hall only reply in general that as "Tho&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Romans ii. 12.</NOTE> who have &s;inned in the Law &s;hall be judged by the Law, &s;o tho&s;e who have &s;inned without the Law <HI>[if they peri&s;h]</HI> &s;hall peri&s;h without it." As the &s;pirit of God hath not
<PB N="11" REF="008737_0017_1030A463775E3990">
thought fit to declare how far the <HI>Satisfaction</HI> of CHRIST will be applied to tho&s;e who never heard of his name, we mu&s;t not pre&s;ume to be wi&s;e above what is written. The nations that &s;it in darkne&s;s and the &s;hadow of death mu&s;t be left to God's <HI>uncovenanted</HI> Mercies, to judge them according to the mea&s;ure of Knowlege and Light which they have received. The Tribunal of the Almighty is erected upon infinite Wi&s;dom, Ju&s;|tice and Goodne&s;s&mdash;and infinite Wi&s;dom, Ju&s;tice and Goodne&s;s cannot commit Error or Wrong!</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to the &s;econd que&s;tion&mdash;"Why doth the Almighty &s;o long delay the accompli&s;hment of his own gracious promi&s;es?" We mu&s;t an&s;wer much in the &s;ame general manner. Known unto God, and him alone, are all his coun&s;els from the foundation of the world. Some Conjectures, however, we may humbly offer on this head, without incurring the charge of pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>EXCEPT in extraordinary ca&s;es, the &s;upreme Being &s;eems to conduct all his operations by general laws; and, both in the Natural and Moral world, the advances to Perfection are gradual and progre&s;&s;ive. The Law and the Prophets, which were of old, were but a faint and my&s;terious Revelation of the will of God, compared to the
<PB N="12" REF="008737_0018_1030A46662800418">
full blaze of the Go&s;pel, whereby his <HI>whole</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xx. 27.</NOTE> <HI>council</HI> &s;hone forth at la&s;t to mankind. The Lord &s;poke once in thunders and lightnings from Mount Sinai,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Exodus xix. 16.</NOTE> but now leaves the conver&s;ion of nations to the ordinary methods of his providence. God did not give the Chri&s;tian revelation it&s;elf, till the<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See &s;ome fine remarks on this head by Dr. Robert&s;on&punc; the celebrated author of the hi&s;tory of Scotland, in his &s;ermon before the &s;ociety in Scotland for propagating Chri&s;tian Knowlege.</NOTE> Roman ambition had brought almo&s;t the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to a kind of &s;imilarity of language and manners, and had opened &s;uch an intercour&s;e between di&s;tant nations, as made that one of the mo&s;t favorable periods for &s;preading a new Religion. Countries were now acce&s;&s;ible that had before been unknown; and univer&s;al peace, added to univer&s;al &s;ubjection to one common Empire, gave the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t and fir&s;t preachers of the Go&s;pel a great advantage in travelling from Clime to Clime.</P>
<P>NOW, who knows but almighty wi&s;dom may have predetermined a period &s;imilar to this, in the &s;ituation of affairs in this New World, for &s;preading his glorious Go&s;pel to the remote&s;t parts of it?</P>
<P>AND the con&s;ideration of this leads me to the
<PB N="13" REF="008737_0019_1030A46954B1D230">
<HI>Second</HI> head of my di&s;cour&s;e; which was "to make &s;ome remarks on the &s;ituation of things on this Continent, with re&s;pect to the Go&s;pel-oeconomy, and the probability of a &s;peedy accompli&s;hment of the Prophecies which relate to the <HI>fulfilling of the Gentiles,</HI> and final Conver&s;ion of the Nations."</P>
<P>AND here what a &s;eries of remarkable circum&s;tances claim our mo&s;t devout attention? Rea&s;oning upon <HI>moral</HI> as upon <HI>natural</HI> things, what a beautiful analogy &s;hall we find among all the operations of divine Providence?</P>
<P>THE Sun, the glorious Luminary of Day, comes forth from his chambers of the <HI>East,</HI> and, rejoicing to run his cour&s;e, carries Light and Heat and Joy thro' the nations to the remote&s;t parts of the <HI>West,</HI> and returns to the place from whence he came. In like manner it doth appear that the Light of the glorious Go&s;pel is to proceed, till it hath carried one bright Day over all the habitable world; and then will come the end of things. The in&s;pired Writers, we have already &s;een, love to &s;peak of the propagation of Chri&s;tianity, under this figure; as proceeding from the <HI>Ri&s;ing</HI> to the <HI>setting</HI> of the Sun; and this cour&s;e we find it has pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>IN the primitive ages of Simplicity, the fir&s;t indications of Divine&punc; Will were given to the

<HI>Patriarchs</HI> of mankind in the <HI>Eastern</HI> parts of the world, by God him&s;elf, conver&s;ing with them face to face, as they tended their flocks, or journeyed on from pa&s;ture to pa&s;ture. This was the <HI>Dawn</HI> of things. Soon afterwards followed the Law, and then the Prophets, advancing nearer and nearer to a full and perfect Revelation, till at la&s;t it broke forth in its <HI>Meridian</HI> glory, by the coming of the &s;on of God, at that period already re erred to, when the &s;ituation of the world had prepared the way for its more effectual reception. The Wi&s;dom of God was vi&s;ible in all this; and &s;oon did the Chri&s;tian Religion &s;pread it&s;elf <HI>Westward,</HI> till it reached the va&s;t Atlantic ocean, and the I&s;les of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> where the po&s;terity of Japhet dwelt.</P>
<P>NOW among the&s;e I&s;les, or places on the Ocean, or We&s;tern parts, as they are indifferently phra&s;ed, GREAT-BRITAIN, our Mother-country, that <HI>ultima Thule</HI> of the ancients, bore a principal figure.

HERE the matter re&s;ted. This was the <HI>first</HI> State of the Go&s;pel-progre&s;s. To the We&s;tward of Britain the ancients &s;eem to have known nothing. They con&s;idered the&s;e i&s;lands as the ends of the world; and exten&s;ive as the Roman empire was at our Saviour's coming, this American continent, more exten&s;ive than it all, lay entirely hid from their knowlege, and &s;eems to have been re&s;erved as the &s;tage of a <HI>&s;econd</HI> remarkable period in the Go&s;pel-progre&s;s. Not a ve&s;tige, therefore, of Chri&s;tianity was pro|pagated hither, till after it had kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Old World, in various forms and under various corruptions, for at lea&s;t fifteen centuries. But, at the expiration of that period, it plea&s;ed God to open the way to the di&s;covery of new countries, which likewi&s;e opened the way to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Go&s;pel in them. For it is obvious to remark, that the nations, which were rai&s;ed up for this purpo&s;e, were tho&s;e among whom Chri&s;tianity was openly profe&s;&s;ed, and con&s;equently they carried their religion along with them. Being likewi&s;e &s;uperior to all the re&s;t of the world in the arts of Commerce and every improvement of civil life, they were the

fitte&s;t to explore new &s;ettlements, conciliate the affections of the natives, and pu&s;h their di&s;coveries to the greate&s;t extent. This they did with remarkable zeal and &s;ucce&s;s; and, tho' it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that they have made u&s;e of the advantages which they enjoyed, chiefly for the &s;ecular purpo&s;es of extending their Empire and Commerce, yet they have not been altogether negligent of the propagation of the &s;acred Religion which they profe&s;s.</P>
<P>IN this divine work, our Mother-country, one of the pure&s;t branches of the Chri&s;tian-church, always foremo&s;t in every pious and humane undertaking, has &s;ignally exerted her&s;elf. In her, even in an age wherein Chri&s;tianity hath lo&s;t much of its influence on the lives of men, many public Societies have been formed, and noble contributions made, with the glorious view of extending the Knowlege of God over this va&s;t untutored Continent. At the head of the&s;e is ju&s;tly placed that venerable <HI>&s;ociety, incorporated for propagating the go&s;pel in foreign parts,</HI> in who&s;e &s;ervice mo&s;t of you, my brethren, have the Honor to be employed, and for promoting who&s;e pious de&s;igns we are now voluntarily a&s;&s;embled together. This augu&s;t and venerable body con&s;i&s;ts of the principal dignitaries of our

church, &s;undry of the prime nobility of the nation, and many other pious per&s;ons of every degree. It has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for near four&s;core of years, and, by the providence of God, has been remarkably enabled to &s;upport the great and <HI>growing</HI> expence incident to &s;uch an undertaking.</P>
<P>TWO objects have mo&s;t worthily employed the attention of this Society; the <HI>first</HI> to provide for the admini&s;tration of religious ordinances among our own Coloni&s;ts them&s;elves, who have hitherto been generally too thinly &s;ettled to be able to &s;upport a regular mini&s;try without &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and <HI>&s;econdly</HI> to win over the Heathen-natives to the knowlege of God, and a firm attachment to our national intere&s;t. The&s;e two de&s;igns, however much evil men may &s;trive to &s;eparate them, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily go hand in hand. Should the Society employ them&s;elves wholly to the bu&s;ine&s;s of converting the Indian natives from Heatheni&s;m, while they &s;uffered their own colonies to degenerate into a &s;tate little better than that Heatheni&s;m it&s;elf, the attempt would be equally vain and unju&s;t. For it would be to little purpo&s;e for us to &s;end out Mi&s;&s;ionaries among them to per&s;uade them to embrace our Religion, unle&s;s the fruits and "Light of our Religion &s;hould &s;o &s;hine before them, that they

<P>THE &s;upport, therefore, of Chri&s;tianity among our&s;elves, and the propagation of it among our Heathen Neighbours, are but different parts of the &s;ame undertaking; and tho' we have not hitherto had any great &s;ucce&s;s in the latter, yet it is our duty to continue our be&s;t endeavours. For who knows either the particular time when, or the means by which, the Lord may be plea&s;ed to accompli&s;h his own divine Promi&s;es?</P>
<P>THE Conver&s;ion of nations has often, before now, been brought about when but lea&s;t expected; and by means which, to human fore&s;ight, &s;eemed the lea&s;t probable. One &s;ingle Savage, fully convinced of the Truth of Chri&s;tianity, and truly animated by its &s;ublime &s;pirit, may perhaps, thro' the power of the living God, at &s;ome future period, be rendered an Apo&s;tle to the re&s;t, and an in&s;trument of turning thou&s;ands from the ways of Darkne&s;s and the "power of Satan, to the marvellous light of Chri&s;t, that they may receive forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, and an inheritance among them which are &s;anctified by faith that is in Him."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xxvi. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE></P>

INNUMERABLE methods, be&s;ides this, are in the providence of that God, who&s;e power who &s;hall tell? And it is impo&s;&s;ible but, in his own appointed time, he mu&s;t give the promi&s;ed ble&s;&s;ing to the pious endeavours which are continually u&s;ed for the propagation of his Go&s;pel in this We&s;tern world.</P>
<P>MANY ob&s;tacles, which formerly lay in the way of this great work, &s;eem now to be almo&s;t entirely removed. We were, heretofore, but a &s;mall people, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an incon&s;iderable &s;pot of this Continent. Our acce&s;s to the heathen nations was difficult and dangerous. Our knowlege of their country was but very limited; and the arts of our bu&s;y enemies had &s;own many prejudices among them to our di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>BUT now the ca&s;e is much altered. We are become a great and growing people; extending, and likely to extend, our, empire far over this continent. The pre&s;ent war, which we &s;hort|&s;ighted mortals con&s;idered as one of the greate&s;t evils, is like to be productive of the be&s;t of con&s;equences. With the deepe&s;t adoration, we behold the hand of Providence in it. A &s;eries of unlooked-for &s;ucce&s;&s;es has ble&s;&s;ed our arms, for which we and our po&s;terity, throughout all generations, ought to offer up continual Hymns

of gratitude and prai&s;e to the Giver of all victory. The Prote&s;tant intere&s;t in America has now received &s;uch &s;ignal advantages, and obtained &s;uch &s;ure footing, that we tru&s;t neither the machinations of its inveterate enemies, nor even <HI>the gates of hell</HI> it&s;elf, &s;hall ever prevail again&s;t it. Our credit with the Indian natives begins to &s;tand in a high point of light. A more thorough knowlege of their country and manners is obtained than ever we had before. Strong fortifications are fixed, which will always facilitate our acce&s;s to them. The attention of all ranks of men is now more turned to the pro&s;ecution of our intere&s;ts on this continent than ever was known at any former period; and if it &s;hall plea&s;e God to direct the hearts of our Rulers to a Peace which may in any degree be an&s;werable to our former &s;ucce&s;&s;es, then will be the time when we may expect to &s;ee Chri&s;tianity propagated to advantage.</P>

This zealous &s;ervant of Chri&s;t had formed a ju&s;t idea of the work he had undertaken, and con&s;idered it as a field wherein he was to encounter many difficulties, and reap but few worldly advantages.

<P>BUT not &s;o the man of comprehen&s;ive knowlege. Not &s;o the Preacher who has a clear and glowing view of his Ma&s;ter's religion in general.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>A full explanation of this text, compared with &s;undry others, that foretel the final Conver&s;ion of the Heathen, and &s;eem to have a particular reference to our &s;ituation on this Continent, hath been already attempted.</P>
<P>CHRISTIANITY, we ob&s;erved, was fir&s;t revealed in the <HI>Eastern</HI> Parts of the world. Like the &s;un, there it ro&s;e; and, like him, advancing <HI>Westward</HI> through the nations, diffu&s;ed light and love and joy, wherever it came. At length, it cro&s;&s;ed the va&s;t Atlantic;
<PB N="36" REF="008737_0041_1030A4AA4945FA48">
and, in the &s;ettlement of the&s;e colonies, a way was opened for adding a large inheritance to the Kingdom of Je&s;us, in the remote&s;t parts of the <HI>West.</HI></P>
<P>'TIS true that no great progre&s;s hath hitherto been made in this work. There is yet an immen&s;e depth of this continent, who&s;e forlorn inhabitants never had any opportunity "to hear the glad tidings of &s;alvation;" and, of tho&s;e who have been ble&s;t with &s;uch an opportunity, few, very few, have turned a li&s;tening ear to the joyful &s;ound.</P>
<P>BUT "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Corinth. i. 20.</NOTE> the Promi&s;es of God in Chri&s;t are all Yea and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">en." A careful examination of his revealed word hath thoroughly fixed our belief that the time will come, when the Heathen around us &s;hall be gathered into his fold, under the great &s;hepherd and bi&s;hop of &s;ouls. Nay many au&s;picious circum&s;tances in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of things on this continent, already enumerated, give us rea&s;on to expect that the accompli&s;hment of this event is now not far remote. And oh! What a triumphant con|&s;ideration is this, to tho&s;e who believe the Go&s;pel of Je&s;us "to be the power of God unto &s;alvation?"</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="008737_0042_1030A4AD4EA26DF0">
NOW, one of tho&s;e circum&s;tances, which was but &s;lightly mentioned before, I have at pre&s;ent the mo&s;t favorable opportunity of con&s;idering more at large. It is "the &s;pirit which di&s;plays it&s;elf, through the&s;e American colonies, for the founding &s;eminaries of Learning; and the great influence which the advancement of the Sciences has on the advancement of Chri&s;t's Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>IN order to do ju&s;tice to this &s;ubject, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ome account of the Human Sciences, as well as of the &s;ublime Science of Chri&s;tianity; to &s;hew the &s;ub&s;erviency of the former to the advancement of the latter, and thereby to engage your continued favour and protection of this infant &s;eminary. And that I may proceed with the greater preci&s;ion and clearne&s;s, l &s;hall recur to fir&s;t principles.</P>
<P>IF we con&s;ult the con&s;titution of our nature, we &s;hall find our&s;elves, in every pur&s;uit, actuated by the de&s;ire of Happine&s;s, and determined to account every thing more or le&s;s valuable, as it contributes more or le&s;s to that end.</P>
<P>HAPPINESS, however, is a complex thing, compounded of many ingredients; and the road to attain it has its labyrinths and windings, not to be travelled, but with caution and fore&s;ight.
<PB N="38" REF="008737_0043_1030A4B2CC0408D8">
For man, being made up of &s;oul and body, &s;u&s;tains a double relation, and is capable of a double kind of plea&s;ure; there being a variety of objects &s;uited to the variety of his affections, pa&s;&s;ions and tempers, when in their &s;ound moral &s;tate. His Happine&s;s, therefore, mu&s;t evi|dently depend on making a right e&s;timate of the&s;e objects, and maintaining this &s;ound tem|perament of con&s;titution; &s;o as to pur&s;ue each of them with a degree of force commen&s;urate to their re&s;pective values, or tendencies to give plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>HENCE, then, whatever enables a man to make a right e&s;timate of things, and to frame his conduct agreeably, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as an engine of his happine&s;s, and is to be valued proportionably. It follows, therefore, that tho&s;e re&s;earches which bring him acquainted with him&s;elf, the ends, u&s;es and mea&s;ures of his &s;everal powers and movements, together with the ends and u&s;es of the various objects with which he &s;tands connected, mu&s;t be a main &s;pring of his happine&s;s; and, in this view, may be denominated his <HI>true Wi&s;dom,</HI> the <HI>first and great Philo&s;ophy;</HI> or that glorious Sy&s;tem of Knowlege, which gives him his chief pre-heminence over the brutes, and exalts him to

the &s;upreme perfection and highe&s;t enjoyment of his nature!</P>
<P>OTHER Sciences may have their u&s;e, as matters of ornament or amu&s;ement. But whenever they interfere with this grand Science of Life and Manners, they are to be di&s;regarded as empty triffles; &s;ubjects at be&s;t but of vain curio&s;ity, or unavailing &s;peculation.</P>
<P>I SHALL, therefore, endeavour to di&s;tingui&s;h the True from the Fal&s;e, the &s;purious parts of Knowlege from tho&s;e of genuine growth, by pointing out to you the e&s;&s;ential branches of this great Ma&s;ter-&s;cience. In doing this, let us never lo&s;e &s;ight of the fundamental principle already laid down, namely that every part of knowlege, (humane knowlege I &s;peak of) derives its value from its tendency to inform us&mdash;</P>
<P>"Quid &s;umus, et quidnam victuri gignimur&mdash;" What we are, and whither de&s;tined; what our con&s;titution and connexions; and what our duties in con&s;equence thereof.</P>
<P>WHOEVER &s;ets out on this enquiry will, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, be &s;truck with the va&s;tne&s;s of the undertaking, and the in&s;ufficiency of his own abilities. Human nature, and the various natures around it, are a copious &s;ubject. Life

is &s;hort, and each man's own experience too &s;canty to trace for him&s;elf the relations and fitne&s;s of things; to examine into all Moral and Phy&s;ical Qualities; and, from thence, to de|duce the Rules of Conduct, and a&s;certain the true Path of Happine&s;s. Like a traveller in a &s;trange country, he will, therefore, be glad to enquire his way of others; and make all po&s;&s;ible u&s;e of the experience of tho&s;e who, with honor and &s;ucce&s;s, have travelled the path of life before him. He will endeavour to avail him&s;elf equally of the good and bad fortune of tho&s;e who&s;e cour&s;e is fini&s;hed, and &s;trive to bring all Antiquity under Contribution to him for wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>BUT how could this be done, if there were not &s;ome method of pre&s;erving, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing our&s;elves of, the experience of others? And here we &s;ee the u&s;e of Languages and Writing. Neverthele&s;s an acquaintance with all &s;orts of languages would be almo&s;t as difficult an acqui&s;ition, as the particular examination of all &s;orts of things. Hence then, it became ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the Learned to fix on &s;ome Univer&s;al Language or Languages, as the grand channel or in&s;trument of conveying their experiences, ob&s;ervations and conclu&s;ions, concerning the conduct of life and the truth of things.</P>

NOW Greek and Latin have been cho&s;en for the&s;e purpo&s;es, on &s;everal &s;ub&s;tantial accounts. For, not to mention that many of the noble&s;t productions of ancient genius were originally written in the&s;e languages, it is to be ob&s;erved that dead languages are more durable, and le&s;s fluctuating, than living ones; and, be&s;ides this, living nations, jealous of each other, would think it too great a mark of di&s;tinction to chu&s;e the language of any particular nation among them, as the grand channel of knowlege and experience.</P>
<P>WE &s;ee, then, that an acquaintance with what is called the Learned Languages is &s;till ju&s;tly con&s;idered as a part of liberal education, and a nece&s;&s;ary introduction to the Sciences. For, tho' words, ab&s;tractly con&s;idered, cannot in them&s;elves add to our knowlege, yet as the Means of Conveying and acquiring knowlege, they will be &s;tudied by all tho&s;e who, to their own experience, would add the experience of tho&s;e who have lived in former ages; or, living in the pre&s;ent, can no otherwi&s;e reader the fruits of their enquiries u&s;eful to mankind, than by Language and Writing.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author found it nece&s;&s;ary to be thus particular in explaining the u&s;e of the Learned Languages; &s;ome regarding them as a needle&s;s part of education, and others con&s;idering them as all the education nece&s;&s;ary to a &s;cholar: Opinions equally prejudicial to the advancement of Sound Knowlege.

NEVERTHELESS, a per&s;on, who knows him&s;elf endued with rea&s;on and under&s;tanding, will not be content to take his knowlege entirely at &s;econd hand. On &s;ubjects &s;o important as the nature and fitne&s;s of things, and the Summum Bonum of man, he will not rely wholly on a Hi&s;torical knowlege, founded on the Experience and Te&s;timony of others; how|ever much his labors may be &s;hortened thereby. He will think it is his duty to examine for him&s;elf, and to acquire a Moral and Phy&s;ical knowlege; founded on his own Experience and Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>THIS is what we call Philo&s;ophy in general; comprehending in it the knowlege of all things Human and Divine, &s;o far as they can be made the objects of our pre&s;ent enquiries. Now, the genuine branches of this Philo&s;ophy, or great &s;y&s;tem of practical Wi&s;dom, together with the nece&s;&s;ary in&s;trumental parts thereof, may be included under the following general heads; it appearing to me that the nature of things admits of no more.</P>
<P N="1">1. LANGUAGES, &amp;c. which have been

<P N="4">4. MORAL Philo&s;ophy; applying all the above to the bu&s;ine&s;s and bo&s;oms of men; deducing the laws of our conduct from our &s;ituation in life and connexions with the Beings around us; &s;ettling the whole OEconomy of the will and Affections; e&s;tabli&s;hing the pre|dominancy of Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience; and guiding us to Happine&s;s, thro' the practice of Virtue.</P>

<P>THIS la&s;t mentioned part of literary ac|compli&s;hment, like the fir&s;t, I grant, is to be con&s;idered rather as an In&s;trument, than a Branch, of Science. But if the above definition be ju&s;t, you will not wonder that we &s;eparate it from Languages, as being of much higher nature than they; and even place the &s;tudy of it after all the other Sciences, &s;eeing they are nece&s;&s;ary and &s;ub&s;ervient to its perfection.</P>
<P>THE materials of every work mu&s;t go before the work it&s;elf; and Compo&s;ition, from one's own &s;tock, can hardly be begun before Philo&s;o|phy and the Sciences have enriched the under|&s;tanding, ripened the judgment and furni&s;hed the Materials or Topics.</P>
<P>WERE any further arguments nece&s;&s;ary to ju&s;tify this di&s;po&s;ition of Rhetoric and Compo&s;i|tion, I might quote the authority of the greate&s;t ma&s;ter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Longinus.</NOTE> which antiquity can boa&s;t. In the

<P>THESE are the capital branches of Human Science, as taught in every liberal in&s;titution; and were there no connexion between them and the knowlege of Chri&s;t's religion, or did we &s;top &s;hort at the former without bringing them home to the latter; we &s;hould then indeed be building up to our&s;elves &s;tructures of emptine&s;s on foundations of rottenne&s;s. But it is im|po&s;&s;ible that ever Sciences, &s;o liberal as tho&s;e mentioned above, tending &s;o directly to elevate and enlarge the mind, &s;hould be at enmity to the divine Science of Chri&s;tianity, and the great my&s;tery of Godline&s;s; that &s;ublime&s;t &s;y&s;tem of Philo&s;ophy, into which even the Angels them|&s;elves de&s;ire to be further initiated!

thereof &s;obers them again. Such an acquain|tance with the &s;ciences, as is de&s;cribed above, will be &s;o far from damping the ardor of religious knowlege, that it will be more and more inflamed thereby; which is a mo&s;t con|vincing argument of the &s;trong and immediate connexion between them.</P>
<P>WERE it nece&s;&s;ary to be particular on this head, I might mention the example of the greate&s;t and be&s;t Philo&s;ophers of every age; who have always been the mo&s;t devout men. Far from being puffed up with the pride of human Learning, or "a&s;hamed of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t," they have made it their glory, and acknowlege it to contain the only infallible rules of their conduct in this life, and the only foundation of their hope in that which is to come. It is &s;aid of the great Sir I&s;aac Newton, that, tho' he entered further into the depths of Philo&s;ophy than ever mortal before him, yet he accounted the Scriptures of God to be the mo&s;t &s;ublime Philo&s;ophy; and never mentioned his Creator's name without an awful pau&s;e of adoration, wonder and &s;elf-aba&s;ement!</P>
<P>THE further we pu&s;h our enquiries into nature, the more we &s;hall be convinced of the greatne&s;s of its author, and the in&s;ufficiency of

unenlightened Rea&s;on. We &s;hall find many things of the utmo&s;t importance for us to know, which yet will baffle all our efforts, and elude our mo&s;t eager re&s;earches. The creation and various revolutions of the world; the fall and redemption of man; the la&s;t judgment and an immortality to come; are &s;ubjects in which no human wi&s;dom could in&s;truct us, unle&s;s the Lord had been plea&s;ed to reveal him&s;elf concerning them.</P>
<P>AND yet what is all the Philo&s;ophy in the world compared to a knowlege in the&s;e points? Where is its &s;ublimity, or what is its &s;ig|nificancy to us, if it affords us no infallible rule of duty at pre&s;ent, and no ground of hope hereafter? If it leaves us in the dark concerning our own original, the means of &s;alvation from &s;in and mi&s;ery, and the immortal &s;tate of our &s;ouls in the untried periods of eternity?</P>
<P>WHAT joy, then, mu&s;t it yield a &s;incere Enquirer, to be &s;ufficiently informed upon the&s;e important &s;ubjects, by a revelation from God him&s;elf?

Containing doctrines the mo&s;t ra|tional and exalted, precepts the mo&s;t humane and important, a &s;tile the mo&s;t rich and per&s;uasive, abounding in all the variety of tropes and figures, and "&s;harper than a two-edged Sword," the &s;criptures are calculated to &s;eize and purify the affections; to enlighten and exalt the under&s;tanding&punc; to alarm and rou&s;e the con&s;cience; to confirm our hopes and remove our fears; to bani&s;h &s;uper&s;tition and ca&s;t down the idols of the nations; to mitigate lawle&s;s power and humanize the rage of barbari&s;m; and to call men off from a vain dependence on external ceremonies to a tru&s;t in the Living God, obedience to his moral laws, repentance for pa&s;t offences, an acceptable and manly devotion of heart, a longing after immortality, an union with the divine nature, and an exaltation to the life of angels and felicity un&s;peakable!</P>
<P>EVERY thing which human rea&s;on would de&s;ire to know is fully brought to light in the Go&s;pel. Here the Origin, Connexions and
<PB N="49" REF="008737_0054_1030A4D4F8D23FD8">
Duties of man are amply de&s;cribed! Here his departure from his fir&s;t Innocence and rectitude, the degradation of his nature, and all the marvellous workings of omnipotence to reclaim and &s;ave him, are di&s;tinctly recorded! Here we &s;ee the Prophets prophe&s;ying for his &s;ake, the old world drowned, another fitted up, and la&s;t of all the Lord of Glory de&s;cending from heaven, to accompli&s;h the amazing Plan of Redemption, and re&s;tore him to divine favour! Here al&s;o Life and Immortality are brought to light, and the Future di&s;played! Here the &s;olemnity of the la&s;t Judgment, and the a&s;|toni&s;hing &s;cenes of the general Con&s;ummation, are laid before us! Here Death is di&s;armed of his Sting, and the Grave of Victory! Here the gates of immortality are &s;et open&mdash;and Oh! what an unutterable weight of Glory beyond&mdash;</P>
<P>SAY, then, ye Wi&s;e Ones of the earth! ye Sages, ye Philo&s;ophers, or by whatever other names ye would be called! &s;ay now, what is the amount of your knowlege, if it re&s;olves you not on &s;uch &s;ubjects as the&s;e? Can an acquaintance with human Science render you indifferent to &s;uch an exalted &s;y&s;tem of heavenly Wi&s;dom as this? Surely not. The one will only inflame your thir&s;t for the other, and make you pur&s;ue
<PB N="50" REF="008737_0055_1030A4D6AE3E93C8">
it as the fini&s;hing and mo&s;t durable part of the whole.</P>
<P>"FOR, whether there be Tongues, they &s;hall cea&s;e; or whether there be Knowlege, it &s;hall vani&s;h away." This vain world it&s;elf, all its gay &s;cenes, every thing that we account wi&s;e or curious in it, &s;hall come to an end and plea&s;e no more. But the &s;ublime &s;ubjects of the Go&s;pel will &s;till be New. They will be the object of our endle&s;s enquiries, and con&s;titute a Philo&s;ophy, the Marvellous of which eternity cannot exhau&s;t, not the longe&s;t period of duration bring to decay.</P>
<P>AND now, having &s;hewn the &s;ub&s;erviency of Human Science to the advancement of Chri&s;|tianity, and that a liberal education is a means of &s;preading a thir&s;t for heavenly wi&s;dom; what need I add more to be&s;peak your continued favour and protection of this Seminary? Surely it cannot be indifferent to us, whether the knowlege of Chri&s;t and his ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pel &s;hall be &s;pread over this continent, or not? Surely it cannot be indifferent to us, whether our own children &s;hould be bred up in ignorance; or whether they &s;hall &s;hine in every moral ex|cellence, the glory of their country and a light to the world around them? We mu&s;t know the
<PB N="51" REF="008737_0056_1030A4DAE1511938">
relation in which we &s;tand to them, and the account which we &s;hall one day be required to give of their tender years.</P>
<P>FOR whatever bu&s;ine&s;s a man may be de&s;igned, a liberal education will not only prepare him for that, but al&s;o for a life of general virtue.&mdash;If intended for the noble Profe&s;&s;ion of the Law, to be the protectors of the innocent and the advocates of ju&s;tice; the be&s;t foundation will be a love of huma|nity, and a thorough knowlege of the laws of nature, and general rights of mankind. If for the &s;ervice of the &s;tate, the &s;ame will hold good. The man be&s;t acquainted with the nature of civil government, the ju&s;t bounds of authority and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and the univer&s;al principles of equity and virtue, will always be the able&s;t Politician and firme&s;t Patriot. A|gain, if intended to follow the healing art of Phy&s;ic, the knowlege of Mathematics and the various branches of Natural Philo&s;ophy, will be the be&s;t introduction. If propo&s;ed for the Mini&s;try of the ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pel, every human Science ought to lend its aid, and kindle a love of wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>IF other arguments were nece&s;&s;ary to induce you to the cultivation of knowlege and the
<PB N="52" REF="008737_0057_1030A4DDD2FE6958">
&s;upport of &s;uch u&s;eful &s;eminaries as this, I might di&s;play to you the wonderful change which the Sciences have produced in the &s;tate of every country, where they have been received. Tho' they have not been able whol|ly to eradicate Tyranny, yet they have always checked and mitigated its influence; in&s;piring humanity, love of moral excellency, and every &s;ofter virtue.</P>
<P>BUT why &s;hould I bring in&s;tances from other countries, when one of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious is before our eyes? This poli&s;hed and flouri&s;hing City! what was it four&s;core years ago? Even its foundations were not then laid; and in their place was one depth of gloomy wilderne&s;s! This very &s;pot, this Seat of the Mu&s;es&mdash;where I have now the honour to &s;tand, the preaching the Go&s;pel of Je&s;us, &s;urrounded with men excelling in every valuable accompli&s;h|ment, and youths ri&s;ing after their great example&mdash;had I &s;een it then, what &s;hould I have found it? A &s;pot rank with weeds perhaps, or the ob&s;cure retreat of &s;ome lawle&s;s and gloomy &s;avage!</P>
<P>O GLORIOUS change! O happy day! that now beholds the Sciences planted where bar|barity was before! that now &s;ees this Re&s;titution
<PB N="53" REF="008737_0058_1030A4E0C6786AF8">
at length brought to &s;uch perfection, as to extend the Laurel to its fir&s;t worthy &s;ons! how ought &s;uch advances in knowlege to rejoice every heart among us; but e&s;pecially tho&s;e who&s;e pious labors have contributed e|minently to that end.</P>
<P>OH! heaven born Wi&s;dom, and thou divine Science! proceed, &s;till proceed! let other &s;e|minaries &s;uch as this ri&s;e, where other de&s;arts now extend; and, beyond the&s;e, let others and &s;till others ri&s;e, thro' the remote&s;t depths of this continent; till Chri&s;t's kingdom is made u|niver&s;al, and "the Heathen be given him for an inheritance, and the uttermo&s;t parts of the earth for a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion!"</P>
