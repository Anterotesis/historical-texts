<BIBL>REV. V. 11, 12.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>And I beheld, and I heard the Voice of many Angels round about the Throne, and the Bea&s;ts, and the Elders, and the Number of them was ten thou&s;and Times ten thou&s;and, and Thou&s;ands of Thou&s;ands, Saying with a loud Voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was &s;lain, to receive Power, and Riches, and Wi&s;|dom, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory, and Ble&s;&s;ing.</HI></Q>

<P>_IN this Book we have the <HI>Revelation</HI> of Je&s;us Chri&s;t delivered to his Ser|vant <HI>John,</HI> concerning Events relating to the Church to the la&s;t Judgment: Particularly, a wonderful Prophecy of the Ri&s;e and Reign of <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> who&s;e Coming is after <HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of Satan, with

<P>In the Beginning of this Chapter, <HI>John</HI> &s;eeth in Vi&s;ion a &s;ealed Book presented in his Hand who &s;itteth on the Throne, that is the Father. This Book no doubt was the Book of God's Coun&s;els and Decrees re&s;pecting the Things which &s;hould befall his Church to the End of the World, this Book of the <HI>Revelation.</HI> Proclamation is then made by an Angel, <HI>Who is worthy to open the Book, and to loo&s;e the Seals thereof,</HI> v. 2. None of all the Crea|tures is found able to reveal the&s;e deep Things of God, and to fulfil his Coun&s;els, both which are &s;up|po&s;ed, by a learned Expo&s;iter, to be comprehended in the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions. Upon this <HI>John</HI> weeps, ha|ving an earne&s;t De&s;ire to know the&s;e hidden Things: While he is mourning, one of the Elders faith to him, Weep not: Behold, <HI>the Lion of the Tribe of</HI> Judah&mdash;<HI>hath prevailed to open the Book,</HI> v. 5. Upon which <HI>John</HI> beheld, and &s;aw in the Mid&s;t of the Throne, <HI>a Lamb as it had been &s;lain,</HI> v. 6: He who is a <HI>Lion,</HI> the Chief in Dignity and Strength, and of the royal Tribe, is repre&s;ented al&s;o as a <HI>Lamb</HI> &s;lain; for it was in virtue of his Obedience to Death, that he opened the Seals. When our Lord had taken the Book out of the Hand of the Father, the four <HI>Bea&s;ts,</HI> and the four and twenty Elders the Mini&s;ters and Church, fall down before <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> humble Adoration, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> a

<HI>new Song, &s;aying, Thou art worthy to take the Book, and to open the Seals thereof: For thou wa&s;t &s;lain, and ha&s;t redeemed us to God by thy Blood, out of every Kindred, and Tongue and People, and Nation.</HI> A new Song, upon account of the joyful Occa&s;ion of it, the Lamb's taking the Book, and opening the Seals thereof; and upon account of the new Tran&s;ports of Devotion, with which they rai&s;ed the Song, upon &s;uch a wonderful Revelation. And the Redeemed are fitly repre&s;ented as beginning the Song, and leading in it; for they are mo&s;t nearly concern'd. And then the Angels join in Con&s;ort with them, and with united Voice &s;hout forth the Prai&s;es of the Son of God, in the Words which I have cho&s;en for my Text, <HI>Worthy is the Lamb that was &s;lain&mdash;.</HI> Here is a <HI>loud Voice</HI> attributed to the Angels, and perfected Spirits; for tho' the Angels have not bo|dily Organs of Speech as we, and the Saints have not, the mo&s;t of them, as yet receiv'd their Bodies glo|rified; yet have they the mo&s;t excellent Way of u|niting in the Wor&s;hip of God, and expre&s;&s;ing their high Prai&s;es to him. We read of the <HI>Tongues of Angels,</HI> and when the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> was caught up to the third Heaven, he heard <HI>un&s;peakable Words</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 13. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the Words we may ob&s;erve, 1. Our Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t is the Lamb that was &s;lain. 2. He is worthy to receive Power, and Riches, and Wi&s;dom, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory, and Ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P N="1">1. DOCT. <HI>Our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Lamb that was &s;lain.</HI> 1. He is the Lamb. 2. He was &s;lain.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="8" REF="005685_0005_1026BF80D88C2E00">1. <HI>Our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Lamb.</HI> He is &s;uch by way of Eminency, The Lambs u&s;ed in Sa|crifice of Old, were but &s;hadowy Emblems and Types of him, who is the Lamb of God. Here we may con&s;ider, upon what Accounts Chri&s;t may be compared to a Lamb. I &s;hall but ju&s;t Hint at two or three Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. Our Lord Je&s;us may be compared to a Lamb <HI>for his Purity, Innocence and U&s;efulne&s;s.</HI> The Lamb is a cleanly inoffen&s;ive Creature, and &s;o fit to re|&s;emble him who is <HI>holy, harmle&s;s and undefiled,</HI> Heb. 7.6. He was not &s;hapen in Iniquity, as we were. No, the Child Je&s;us was conceived in the Womb of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> by the Power of the Holy Gho&s;t, and con&s;equent upon this, it is &s;aid to her, <HI>That holy Thing which &s;hall be born of thee, &s;hall be called the Son of God,</HI> Luke 1.35. This Lamb was without Blemi&s;h in the perfect Rectitude of his Nature, and in his Life and Conver&s;ation. He did no Evil, nor was Guile found in his Mouth. And he is mo&s;t u&s;eful and profitable to all that obtain an Intere&s;t in him: They have in him the choice&s;t Food, of Virtue to nouri&s;h them to eternal Life; and cloath|ing that excells the pure&s;t and fine&s;t Wool, the Robes of his perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. Our Lord Je&s;us may be compar'd to a Lamb for his <HI>Meekne&s;s and Silence under Sufferings.</HI> The brute Creatures are not capable of moral Vertues, however there is &s;uch a Re&s;emblance of the&s;e even in &s;ome of them, that God in his Word is plea&s;ed to make u&s;e of them in Compari&s;ons. Mat, 10.16.
<PB N="9" REF="005685_0006_1026BF825E8C7710">
<HI>Be ye therefore wi&s;e as Serpents, and harmle&s;s as Doves.</HI> Now the Lamb is a lively Emblem of Meekne&s;s; gentle, &amp; free from Fiercene&s;s, &amp; goeth to the Slaugh|ter without that Noi&s;e and Re&s;i&s;tance which &s;ome other Creatures make. Thus Je&s;us under the hea|vie&s;t Sufferings, neither murmured again&s;t God, nor reviled Men; but &s;ilently and quietly bore that Puni&s;hment which was due to his People for their Iniquities, I&s;ai. 53.7. <HI>He is brought as a Lamb to the Slaughter, and as a Sheep before her Shearers is dumb, &s;o he opened not his Mouth.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. And it may be principally, <HI>becau&s;e he is the great Antitype, who was offered to God in Sacrifice once for all.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Lamb of God, which taketh away the Sin of the World,</HI> John 1.29. In this Allu&s;ion there &s;eems to be an e&s;pecial Reference to tho&s;e Sacrifices which were offered to God under the Levitical Di&s;pen&s;a|tion, and did prefigure Je&s;us Chri&s;t particularly, to the <HI>Lambs</HI> which were frequently offered to God as bloody Sacrifices. The daily Sacrifices offer'd Morn|ing and Evening, were <HI>two Lambs,</HI> Exod. 29. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">8. And the <HI>pa&s;chal Lamb</HI> did in an eminent Manner typify Je&s;us Chri&s;t our <HI>Pa&s;&s;over,</HI> 1 Cor. 5.7.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t was &s;lain.</HI></P>
<P>As the Sacrifices under the Law were kill'd, ha|ving their Blood, which is their Life, pour'd out at the Altar: So our Lord Je&s;us was &s;mitten with the Sword of Ju&s;tice, and his Blood was &s;hed on the Cro&s;s, when he gave his Life a Ran&s;om for many. No le&s;s a Price than the Blood of him who is God,
<PB N="10" REF="005685_0007_1026BF8603AD8F10">
was &s;ufficient for the Redemption of his People, <HI>Ye were not redeemed with corruptible Things, as Sil|ver and Gold, from your vain Conver&s;ation received by Tradition from your Fathers; but with the pre|cious Blood of Chri&s;t, as of a Lamb without Blemi&s;h and without Spot.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. DOCT. <HI>The Lord Je&s;us, the Lamb &s;lain, is worthy to receive Power, and Riches, and Wi&s;dom, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory, and Ble&s;&s;ing.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. In what Re&s;pects, and upon what Accounts may our Lord be &s;aid to be worthy of what is here a&s;cribed to him? 2. We may enumerate the &s;eve|ral Particulars, and &s;hew that our Lord is worthy of all and every one of them.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>In what Re&s;pects, and upon what Accounts may our Lord be &s;aid to be worthy of what is here a&s;cribed to him?</HI></P>
<P>Now in general, I may an&s;wer, He is worthy in a &s;trict and proper Sen&s;e, upon account of the infi|nite Dignity of his Per&s;on, as the Son of God; and upon account of the Merit of his Obedience as God-Man Mediator.</P>
<P N="1">I. Our Lord Je&s;us is worthy of this A&s;cription of Prai&s;e <HI>upon account of the infinite Dignity of his Per&s;on?</HI></P>
<P>As he is the Son of God, the &s;econd Per&s;on in the &s;acred Trinity, he is the Brightne&s;s of the Fa|ther's Glory, and is worthy to be glorified as God. The Name of God is in him, and he is one with the Father in the e&s;&s;ential Perfections of the divine
<PB N="11" REF="005685_0008_1026BF887AE71230">
Nature. <HI>I and my Father are One,</HI> John 10.30. His infinite Excellencies demand this religious Ado|ration, and he mu&s;t be worthy to receive this Doxo|logy and A&s;cription of Prai&s;e from the heavenly Quire. And indeed this may be &s;aid to be the Ground and Foundation of all; however the next Rea&s;on and Motive here &s;eem to be his perfect O|bedience as Mediator, to which his divine Nature communicates infinite Worth and Value; &s;o that he purcha&s;ed the Church with his own Blood, a compleat Deliverance from all the Evil of Sin, and the full Enjoyment of God for ever in Heaven; which leads me to the &s;econd Thing,</P>
<P N="2">2. The Lord Je&s;us is worthy of this <HI>as God-Man Mediator, having fini&s;hed the Work which God gave him to do upon Earth.</HI></P>
<P>Our Lord, when expiring on the Cro&s;s, &s;aid, <HI>It is fini&s;hed</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John 19.30.</NOTE>. And accordingly in his wonderful Prayer to his Father, he hath the&s;e Words, <HI>I have glorified thee on the Earth: I have fini&s;hed the Work which thou gave&s;t me to do. And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own &s;elf, with the Glory which I had with thee before the World was,</HI> John 17.4, 5. The Lord Je&s;us having fulfill'd his Fa|ther's Will on Earth by his active and pa&s;&s;ive Obe|dience, is worthy to receive the full Reward. Phil. 2.6,&mdash;11. <HI>Who being in the Form of God, thought it not Robbery to be equal with God: But made him|&s;elf of no Reputation, and took upon him the Form of a Servant, and was made in the Likene&s;s of Men. And being found in Fa&s;hion as a Man, he humbled
<PB N="12" REF="005685_0009_1026BF8BF0D9AD20">
him&s;elf, and became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Cro&s;s. Wherefore God hath al&s;o highly exalted him, and given him a Name which is above every Name: That at the Name of Je&s;us every Knee &s;hould bow, of Things in Heaven, and Things in Earth, and Things under the Earth: And that every Tongue &s;hould confe&s;s, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is Lord, to the Glory of God the Father.</HI> The Son of God may now, as the Head of the Church, challenge all Power, Riches and Glory; whatever is needful to perfect the Glory of his exalted State, and to put him into a Capacity to be&s;tow on his People all the Benefits of that eternal Redemption which he has purcha&s;ed. And he has accordingly receiv'd the Promi&s;e of the Father, the Gift of the Holy Gho&s;t, called here <HI>the &s;even Spirits of God,</HI> v. 6. upon account of his ma|nifold and perfect Operations.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>We may enumerate the &s;everal Particulars, and &s;hew that our Lord Je&s;us is worthy to receive all and every one of them.</HI></P>
<P>Now when it is &s;aid that our Lord is worthy to receive Power, <HI>&amp;c. Beza</HI> gives this as the Meaning of the Place, He is worthy to whom all Prai&s;e &s;hould be given as the mo&s;t powerful, wi&s;e&mdash; I &s;hall con&s;ider the Words as they lie in the Text.</P>
<P N="1">I. Our Lord Je&s;us is worthy to receive <HI>Power.</HI></P>
<P>The Lamb &s;lain de&s;erves to be celebrated, and re|ceive all Prai&s;e as one mo&s;t powerful. The Word here u&s;ed &s;ignifies Power, Fortitude.

Things, he mu&s;t have a Right to univer&s;al Domi|nion. <HI>Chri&s;t came, who is over all, God ble&s;&s;ed for ever,</HI> Rom. 9.5. But we are now &s;peaking of his Power as God-Man Mediator. Now look upon him in this Character, and he receiveth his Power as a Gift from the Father. <HI>All Power is given un|to me in Heaven and in Earth,</HI> Matth. 28.18. No mere Creature is worthy to receive univer&s;al Em|pire; to be King over all. But Je&s;us is worthy to receive Power and Dominion over all Creatures, both in Heaven and Earth. And this mediatorial Kingdom is given him as a Reward of his infinite Conde&s;cention in his Humiliation, and with an e&s;pe|cial Regard to the Salvation of his People.&mdash;<HI>And &s;et him at his own right Hand in the heavenly Places: Far above all Principality, and Power, and Might, and Dominion, and every Name that is named, not only in this World, but al&s;o in that which to come: And hath put all Things under his Feet, and gave him to be the Head over all Things to the Church,</HI> Eph. 1.20,&mdash;22. <HI>Angels,</HI> even the highe&s;t Order of them, Thrones and Dominions, are mo&s;t willing|ly &s;ubject to him, and fulfill his Plea&s;ure; they are all <HI>mini&s;tring Sprits</HI> under him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. 1.14.</NOTE>. Yea, the <HI>Devils</HI> are forcibly bro't under his Power, and he controuls them according to his &s;overeign Will. While on Earth, he ca&s;t them out of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and will in due Time &s;hut them up in the bottomle&s;s Pit. There's a burning Hell prepar'd for the Devil, and his Angels. Our Lord al&s;o rules among the <HI>Inha|bitants of the Earth,</HI> and di&s;po&s;eth of Kingdoms and Countries according to his Will. <HI>By him Kings

reign, and Princes decree Ju&s;tice.</HI> He makes Ru|lers Benefactors to their People, or permits Tyrants to oppre&s;s them in his holy Di&s;plea&s;ure. He makes Peace, or draws the Sword of War. He gives Health, or &s;ends wa&s;ting Di&s;ea&s;es. In a Word, He rules in the Mid&s;t of his Enemies, and when he plea|&s;eth, makes them his willing People in the Day of his Power. He &s;ets up his &s;piritual Kingdom when and where he plea&s;eth, giving his Covenant-People the Laws and Ordinances of his Hou&s;e, and be|&s;towing the &s;aving Ble&s;&s;ings of this Kingdom on all his faithful People, who by his Word and Spirit are made willing to &s;ubmit to him as their Prince and Saviour. Yea, he has the lower Orders of Creatures put under him, the Bea&s;ts of the Field, the Fowl of the Air, and the Fi&s;h of the Sea. And even the Winds and the Seas obey him. And this his me|diatorial Kingdom mu&s;t abide 'till all the glorious Ends of it are accomplished. <HI>He mu&s;t reign till he hath put all Enemies under his Feet,</HI> 1 Cor. 15.25. Even the la&s;t Enemy, Death, &s;hall be de&s;troy'd, when he &s;hall appear in the great Day of Judgment to the Salvation of his People; and after the Work of that Day is done, conduct them to the King|dom of Glory. Surely our Lord is then worthy to be prai&s;ed as the mo&s;t powerful, his Dominion ruleth over all, and he is every Way equal to this high Office. He is <HI>the bl&s;&s;ed and only Potentate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Our Lord Je&s;us is worthy to receive <HI>Riches.</HI></P>
<P>None may in this Re&s;pect be compar'd with him. The Riches of the whole World are his. Earthly Princes may have a Right to govern; but this doth
<PB N="15" REF="005685_0012_1026BF925CFA3680">
not give them the Property and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the E|&s;tates of their Subjects. But now, the Lord Je&s;us has the full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all Things in Heaven and Earth, of all Riches, whether temporal or &s;piritual. He is the high Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of Heaven and Earth. All Things are Chri&s;t's, and &s;o his People have a Right to them according as he &s;ees them needful and pro|per for them. <HI>Whether</HI> Paul, <HI>or</HI> Apollo, <HI>or</HI> Cephas, <HI>or the World, or Life, or Death, or Things pre&s;ent, or Things to come, all are yours. And ye are Chri&s;ts,</HI> 1 Cor. 3.22, 23. All being in his Hand, he com|municates Grace and Glory, and every good Thing to his People. Agreeably the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays to the <HI>Philippians, My God &s;hall &s;upply all your Need according to his Riches in Glory, by Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> 4 c. 19. We read of Chri&s;t that <HI>he was rich,</HI> 2. Cor. 8.9. Indeed he became <HI>poor,</HI> had not where to lay his Head; but then this was that he might pur|cha&s;e all Riches for his People; And now it has plea&s;ed the Father that <HI>in him &s;hould all Fulne&s;s dwell,</HI> Col. 1.19. As Mediator, our Lord inherits all Things. The <HI>Earth is the Lord's, and the Fulne&s;s thereof,</HI> P&s;al. 24. And &s;o is the Abundance of the Seas, and Trea&s;ures hid in the Sand. And he gives the&s;e Things to whom he will, a large Portion of|tentimes to the Men of this World. And tho' his Followers are not &s;eldom of the poor of this World, yet we mu&s;t remember, that the little they enjoy is better to them than the Abundance of many Wick|ed; for their Saviour gives Meat to them, as be|ing mindful of his Covenant; and be&s;tows infinite|ly better Things, they are rich in Faith, and Heirs of the Kingdom. Which brings me to &s;ay, that all <HI>&s;piritual Riches,</HI> the Riches of Grace and Glory
<PB N="16" REF="005685_0013_1026BF95D9862248">
are Chri&s;t's. And accordingly he invites them that are convinced of their &s;piritual Poverty, to come to him for <HI>Gold tried in the Fire, that they may be rich,</HI> Rev. 3.18. And promi&s;eth, that he will cau&s;e them that love him to <HI>inherit Sub&s;tance,</HI> and that he will <HI>fill their Trea&s;ures,</HI> Prov. 8.21. What an inexhau&s;tible Stock of Merit is laid up in him, in whom God declares his <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> for the Re|mi&s;&s;ion of Sins, the many and great Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of all true Believers! What inexhau&s;tible Stores of Grace are trea&s;ur'd up in him, thro' whom God makes all Grace abound towards his People, and enricheth them with every good and perfect Gift! All the Riches of the Kingdom of Heaven are his. We read of the <HI>holy Jeru&s;alem,</HI> de&s;cending out of Heaven from God, that the City was pure Gold&mdash;the Foundation of the Wall garni&s;h'd with all Man|ner of precious Stones, the Gates twelve Pearls, the Street pure Gold, <HI>Rev.</HI> 21. What Riches are here &s;hadow'd out to us by Metaphors taken from the mo&s;t co&s;tly and precious Things of this Life? And if this hath a next Reference to a glorious Church State upon Earth, the Argument ri&s;eth from the le&s;s to the greater. What an immen&s;e Trea&s;ure is laid up for God's People in Heaven! Upon which they &s;hall live mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly and happily, becom|ing the Children of the Kingdom, and that for ever and ever. And yet all this is a purcha&s;ed Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, bought with the Blood of Chri&s;t, and by him free|ly be&s;towed on them. <HI>Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Fa|ther, inherit the Kingdom.</HI> Well may the Riches of Chri&s;t be called <HI>un&s;earchable Riches;</HI> well may we a&s;cribe Prai&s;e to him as the mo&s;t wealthy, who is appointed <HI>Heir of all Things,</HI> Eph. 5.8.

it would be an Injury, but far from us, to with|hold civil Prai&s;e due to our valiant Commanders and Soldiers, whom the Lord has us'd and honour'd, as his In&s;truments in this wonderful Work. However, en|tirely con&s;i&s;tent with this, we now &s;ing to the Lord, for he has done marvellous Things. <HI>His right Hand, and holy Arm hath gotten him the Victory.

As in over-ruling the Views and Determinations of our honoured Fathers in the civil Government, and then in giving them &s;uch remarkable A&s;&s;i&s;tances in managing a Bu&s;ine&s;s in a Manner new, and attended with many Difficulties: In &s;piriting &s;o many effective Men to offer them&s;elves &s;peedily as Voluntiers in this hazardous Enterprize: In the very uncommon Moderation of the Winter and Continuance of fair Weather, whereby a favou|rable Opportunity was given of expediting this arduous Affair, in equipping Ships of War with Tran&s;ports in a &s;hort Time: In pre&s;erving us from the Small-Pox, when awfully threatned near the Time of embarking: In giving &s;uch a safe and pro&s;perous Voyage: In &s;ending &s;o &s;ea&s;onably to our Help a Number of his Maje&s;ty's Ships of War needful to prevent Succours going to the Enemy, and to defend us by Sea: In ordering the Weather &s;o favourable for the Landing our Forces on the Enemy's Shore,

and for tran&s;porting our Artillery by Land: In the great Security in which our Enemies were &s;urpriz'd by the formidable Approach of our Fleet, and &s;ud|den landing; and their con&s;equent contemptible Oppo&s;ition, which rather turn'd to our Advantage, and again&s;t them&s;elves. Behold! they flee with Lo&s;s, and intimidated precipitantly de&s;ert their Grand Battery, and give it up to us; and thus &s;ome of their heavie&s;t Cannon are turn'd again&s;t them&s;elves: And in this Way did our good God encourage his People with the Joy of his Salvation, even upon their fir&s;t Landing, an Earne&s;t of what he would further do for them. In delivering up &s;ome of our Ene|my's Ships into our Hands, e&s;pecially that large Ship of War &s;o full of Men and Stores, that had &s;he forc'd her Way in the Fog, our Enterprize might have been defeated; but God forbid it. In pre|serving or re&s;toring &s;uch Mea&s;ures of Health; and animating our Officers and Soldiers, tho' hitherto unacquainted with &s;uch Difficulties, to attend the Duties and bear the Fatigues and Hazards of a Siege, and this under the Trial of &s;ome awful Providences. In maintaining &s;uch an Harmony betwen our pru|dent and valiant General PEPPERRELL, and the brave Commodore WARREN, the contrary to which has proved fatal to Expeditions carried on by Land and Sea. In directing and helping our unexpe|rienc'd Soldiers &s;o &s;peedily and dextrou&s;ly to rai&s;e their Batteries again&s;t the Town, and I&s;land Fort; and then to play their Cannon and Mortars with &s;uch Skill and Succe&s;s that the Town is greatly di&s;|tre&s;s'd, and the I&s;land Battery &s;oon made too hot for the Be&s;ieged, they take to the Water for &s;ome Relief. And to crown all, in inclining the Enemy

to &s;urrender the Day before a general A&s;&s;ault was to have been made by Land and Sea, which mu&s;t in all Probability have co&s;t many precious Lives, and the Event have been doubtful. Whereas now, by the good Hand of God upon us, we have a City &s;trongly fortified by Nature and Art, deliver'd up without any great Effu&s;ion of Blood, our own or our Enemies, which mu&s;t have ca&s;t a Damp even upon the Joy of Victory. Ble&s;&s;ed be God the Pre|&s;erver of Men!
