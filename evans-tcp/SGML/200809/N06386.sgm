<P>The OPINION of one that has peru&s;ed <HI>the Summer Morning's Conver&s;ation, concerning Original Sin,</HI> wrote by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Peter Clark,</HI></P>
<P>In TWO Things principally:</P>
<P>FIRST, That he has offered that, which has rendered it impo&s;&s;ible <HI>the doctrine of the imputation of</HI> Adam's <HI>guilt</HI> to his po&s;terity, &s;hould be true in the &s;en&s;e it is held by <HI>Calvini&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>SECONDLY, That tho' he pretends to be a friend to the <HI>Calvini&s;tical</HI> doctrine of <HI>imputed guilt,</HI> yet he has de&s;erted this doctrine and given it up into the hands of its enemies, as it teaches the liablene&s;s of all mankind, without exception, to the torments of hell, on account of the fir&s;t Sin.</P>

<HEAD>The OPINION of one that has peru&s;ed <HI>the Summer Morning's Conver&s;ation, concerning Ori|ginal Sin.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ACCORDING to your de&s;ire, once and a|gain repeated, I now &s;end you my <HI>opinion</HI> of the book entitled, <HI>A &s;ummer morning's con|ver&s;ation,</HI> &amp;c. The intimacy between us may endanger your being prejudiced in favour of what I &s;hall write. I advi&s;e you therefore to read it with caution, judging of it from its intrin&s;ic weight, if it has any, and not as it comes from one that is your tried friend.</P>
<P>My expectations, I own, were con&s;iderably rai&s;ed, when I heard, that the Rev. Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> a Gentleman noted for piety, good &s;en&s;e, learning and candor, as well as for <HI>Calvini&s;tical Orthodoxy,</HI> had undertaken to an|&s;wer the <HI>Winter evening's conference about original &s;in,</HI> which was plau&s;ibly wrote, and, in its manner, I con|fe&s;s, the mo&s;t fitted, of any piece I have &s;een, to lead the common people into other &s;entiments concerning the doctrine of <HI>original &s;in,</HI> than <HI>tho&s;e</HI> they had been taught in our <HI>Catechi&s;m,</HI> and the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of faith</HI> commonly received among us. I &s;oon procured the an&s;wer to this Pamphlet upon its publication, and was eager to read it, having no &s;u&s;picion but that I &s;hould
<PB N="4" REF="008100_0003_102E2A3D4CDAD520">
&s;ee the <HI>Calvini&s;tical</HI> doctrine of <HI>original &s;in</HI> placed in a ju&s;t and &s;trong light, and in a manner &s;o &s;triking, and, at the &s;ame time, &s;o &s;oft and candid, as to gain the lik|ing, if not the conviction, of tho&s;e who were in a con|trary way of thinking: In all which re&s;pects to &s;peak plainly and freely, I am much di&s;appointed; as is the ca&s;e with &s;everal others I have had occa&s;ion to conver&s;e with.</P>
<P>I did not think, that a Gentleman &s;o generally well &s;poken of for his humility, meekne&s;s, candor and good nature, would have wrote in language &s;o evidently be|tokening the want of the&s;e excellent qualities, I mean, as to pre&s;ent exerci&s;e. I &s;ee not, that he di&s;covers a more mode&s;t &s;en&s;e of his own fallibility, than his anta|goni&s;t; or that he writes with a le&s;s imbittered &s;pirit. 'Tis &s;trange, we can't <HI>in meekne&s;s in&s;truct tho&s;e that oppo&s;e them&s;elves.</HI> This is the chri&s;tian manner of &s;peaking, and it is naturally &s;uited to bring men to an <HI>acknowledgment of the truth.</HI> I have frequently had rea&s;on to profe&s;s my&s;elf convinced of the propriety and truth of that &s;aying of Solomon, <HI>A &s;oft an&s;wer turn|eth away wrath; but grievous words &s;tir up anger.</HI> I imagine this Gentleman would have more honored him&s;elf, as well as the cau&s;e he is pleading, and been more likely to <HI>convince gain-&s;ayers,</HI> if he had wrote more in the <HI>meekne&s;s of wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P>How it may appear to others of more penetration than I am ma&s;ter of, I pre&s;ume not to &s;ay; but to me this Gentleman's performance is not &s;o free'd from ambiguity, darkne&s;s, and perplexity, as might be de&s;ired. If my &s;hare of under&s;tanding is not below what is com|mon, there are many, who, upon reading it, mu&s;t &s;ay, if they will &s;peak the real &s;en&s;e of their minds, that it is, in &s;ome places, at lea&s;t, unintelligible to them. Be|&s;ides,
<PB N="5" REF="008100_0004_102E2A3FB969E428">
'tis very unlucky for the common people, that he has been &s;o lengthy. I &s;u&s;pect, the good ends propo|&s;ed by this work will, in a great mea&s;ure, be lo&s;t as to them. They will have neither lei&s;ure nor patience to go thro' with it. I imagine, the tho'ts here expre&s;&s;ed might, to advantage, have been communicated in one third part of the room they at pre&s;ent take up; and the conver&s;ation would then have been more univer|&s;ally attended to.</P>
<P>But the&s;e are comparatively &s;mall things, and I men|tion them <HI>in tran&s;itu</HI> only. What I principally aim at is to let you know my <HI>opinion,</HI> with the <HI>grounds</HI> of it, in two articles. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is, that this Gentleman, &s;o far as I am able to judge, has unhappily &s;aid that, which renders it impo&s;&s;ible the doctrine of the <HI>imputation of</HI> Adam'<HI>s guilt to his po&s;terity</HI> &s;hould be true, I mean in the full &s;en&s;e in which it is maintained by <HI>Calvini&s;ts.</HI> The <HI>&s;econd</HI> is, that tho' he wears the appearance of a friend to the doctrine of imputed guilt, as held by <HI>Cal|vini&s;ts,</HI> yet he has de&s;erted this doctrine, nay, given it up, as it maintains that mankind <HI>univer&s;ally,</HI> infants as well as others, are liable to the damnation of hell-fire, on account of <HI>Adam</HI>'s fir&s;t Sin.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e articles, you will remember, I &s;ay, as 'tis maintained by <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI>; for I have no concern with any private &s;cheme this Gentleman may have of his own, that is aliene from their's. Agreably to the doctrine of <HI>Calvini&s;ts,</HI> (which will be made evi|dent to you under the next head) <HI>Adam</HI>'s po&s;terity, as he was their covenant head, or legal repre&s;entative, are liable to the death he was threatned with in its full &s;en&s;e, without abatement or mitigation, that is, as inclu|ding in it the mi&s;eries of hell after the death of the bo|dy. But 'tis, as I apprehend, impo&s;&s;ible, in con&s;i&s;tency
<PB N="6" REF="008100_0005_102E2A4278C9E338">
with what this Gentleman has &s;aid, that this &s;hould be true. A few words will &s;uffice to &s;et this matter in an ea&s;y, and, as I would hope, a convincing light. This Gentleman has told us, Page 55, that by the
<Q>threatning, they (our fir&s;t-parents) were to die in the very day that he &s;inned.</Q>
And again, in the next Page,
<Q>if there had been no redeemer appointed for fallen man, no &s;atisfaction to the injured ju&s;tice of God for that fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, to make way for his mercy to man, we don't &s;uppo&s;e, that <HI>Adam</HI> would have had any po&s;terity at all; but that he him&s;elf would have been cut off, and peri&s;hed, according to the rigor of the threatning, in the very day, in which he &s;inned, even as the &s;inning angels were, and that everla&s;ting|ly.</Q>
In the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, &s;o far as my under&s;tanding reaches, he has rendered it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;upport the doctrine of the imputation of <HI>Adam</HI>'s guilt to his po&s;|terity, at lea&s;t in the full &s;en&s;e in which <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> maintain it, becau&s;e, in con&s;i&s;tency with them, it don't &s;eem po&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould be their <HI>covenant head,</HI> or <HI>legal repre&s;entative,</HI> &s;o as that they &s;hould be liable with him to the threatned penalty. How could they, &s;ince by the covenant that was made with him, he was to "die the very day he &s;inned," and
<Q>could not have had po&s;terity without the appointment of a redeem|er</Q>
? Surely, if <HI>Adam</HI>'s po&s;terity could not have come into exi&s;tence, as he &s;inned, upon the foot of the covenant God entered into with him, but there was need of the interpo&s;ition of grace, and a &s;aviour, in or|der hereto, this covenant could not be made with him as legally acting for them. Is it po&s;&s;ible, this covenant &s;hould be &s;o made with <HI>Adam</HI> as that his po&s;terity, in virtue of it, &s;hould become liable to the penalty of it, when, according to the tenor of the covenant it&s;elf&punc; they
<PB N="7" REF="008100_0006_102E2A44093D72B0">
mu&s;t, in ca&s;e of his &s;in, have eternally remained in a &s;tate of nonentity? For it is to be remembered, it is not according to the tenor of this covenant, but (as this Gentleman pleads) by an after-provi&s;ional act of grace, mitigating its rigor, and &s;u&s;pending the operation of its penalty, that it became po&s;&s;ible for them to be brought into being. It mu&s;t be a &s;trange &s;ort of covenant, which is &s;o con&s;tituted as to make per&s;ons legally liable to a certain penalty, when, at the &s;ame time, 'tis not po&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be inflicted on them, but by the intro|duction of a po&s;terior act of grace to bring them into exi&s;tence that they might be the capable &s;ubjects of &s;uffering it! To &s;ay, that <HI>Adam</HI> &s;o repre&s;ented his po&s;terity as that they became legally &s;ubjected to the penalty threatned in the covenant made with him; and to &s;ay, at the &s;ame time, that he never could have had po&s;terity in ca&s;e he &s;inned, as in fact he did, but by an after provi&s;ion of grace, is, as far as I am able to con|ceive, &s;o evident an incon&s;i&s;tency, that no intermediate ideas can make it more clearly &s;o, than it at once ap|pears to be upon the bare propo&s;al of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;econd</HI> article concerning which I would give my opinion is, that this Gentleman, tho' he wears the appearance of a friend to the <HI>Calvini&s;tical</HI> doctrine of the imputation of <HI>Adam</HI>'s guilt to his po&s;terity&punc; yet has de&s;erted this doctrine, nay, given it up, as it teaches that they are univer&s;ally liable, on account of his &s;in, to the torments of hell for ever; which, by the way, is the principal &s;en&s;e, in which it is oppo&s;ed by <HI>Arminians,</HI> and, as I think, by the per&s;on he has been plea&s;ed to write again&s;t.</P>
<P>You will be fully let into the rea&s;ons, upon which I have taken up this opinion, and prepared to judge of the validity of them, if I make two things clear to you.
<PB N="8" REF="008100_0007_102E2A484C9AE5F0">
1&s;t. That the <HI>whole</HI> race of <HI>Adam, all</HI> his po&s;terity, according to the <HI>Calvini&s;tical</HI> &s;cheme, &s;o &s;inned in him, and fell with him, or, in other words, are &s;o chargeable with his guilt, have it &s;o imputed to them, as that they are, on that account, liable to, and de&s;erving of, eter|nal damnation, the pains of hell-fire for ever; that it would be con&s;i&s;tent with the ju&s;tice and mercy of God eternally to damn them all; and that, if any of them are not thus damned, it is owing to nothing but grace, which grace might not have been &s;howed to any of them. And 2dly. That this Gentleman has not only with caution avoided to a&s;&s;ert, or vindicate, the doctrine of imputation in <HI>this &s;en&s;e,</HI> but has really given it up into the hands of it's enemies.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. In proof of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e particulars, I might ea&s;ily bring te&s;timonies from all the approved, noted, <HI>Calvani&s;tical</HI> writers of bodies of divinity; I might cite a cloud of witne&s;&s;es from among the mo&s;t famous <HI>orthodox</HI> writers of &s;ermons and tracts, both in <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New-England</HI>; I might place before your view extracts from the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ions of Faith,</HI> as a&s;&s;ented to by mo&s;t of the <HI>Prote&s;tant reformed Churches:</HI> &mdash; But this would carry me too great a length; nor is there any need of &s;o much labour: As it happens, I can &s;upport the pre&s;ent fact by a &s;ingle evidence, that is &s;o circum&s;tanced as to be, at once, the evidence of the <HI>Elders</HI> and <HI>Me&s;&s;engers</HI> of the <HI>Churches of this Province,</HI> and of a great number of the mo&s;t celebra|ted <HI>orthodox</HI> divines in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> nation.</P>
<P>The <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith</HI> was, under the &s;olemnity of an oath, drawn up, and &s;ub&s;cribed by <HI>one Hundred and &s;ix</HI> of as noted and <HI>orthodox</HI> divines as could be collected together from all parts of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> And, as this <HI>confe&s;&s;ion of faith</HI> ex|pre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="9" REF="008100_0008_102E2A4A1FF6A5D0">
the <HI>doctrinal</HI> &s;entiments of the <HI>Elders</HI> and <HI>Me&s;&s;engers</HI> of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's</HI> churches, &s;ynodi|cally convened, Anno 1648, at the call of the govern|ment, they unanimou&s;ly tho't fit to profe&s;s their hear|ty a&s;&s;ent and atte&s;tation to it, excepting &s;ome &s;ections which relate to points of controver&s;ie in church di&s;ci|pline. So that what is bro't, in a way of evidence, from <HI>this confe&s;&s;ion,</HI> may fairly be looked upon as the joint te&s;timony not only of more than <HI>an hundred Engli&s;h Calvini&s;tical Divines,</HI> but of <HI>all the Churches of this Province.</HI> And the &s;ame may be &s;aid of the <HI>longer and &s;horter Catechi&s;ms,</HI> which were compiled, pub|li&s;hed, and recommended by this famous <HI>A&s;&s;embly,</HI> and have been generally taught our children from the beginning of the country to this day.</P>
<P>Be plea&s;ed now to attend to the evidence I &s;hall bring from this <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith,</HI> and the&s;e <HI>Cate|chi&s;ms.</HI></P>
<P>Says the former, I.
<Q>Our fir&s;t parents, being &s;e|duced by the &s;ubtilty and temptation of Satan, &s;in|ned in eating the forbidden fruit.&mdash;II. By this &s;in, they fell from their original righteou&s;ne&s;s and communion with God, and &s;o became dead in &s;in, and wholly defiled in all the faculties and parts of &s;oul and body.&mdash;III. They being the root of all man|kind, <HI>the guilt of this &s;in was imputed,</HI> and the &s;ame death in &s;in and corrupted nature convey'd, to <HI>all</HI> their po&s;terity, de&s;cending from them by ordi|nary generation.&mdash;IV. From this original corrup|tion&mdash;proceed all actual tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions.&mdash;VI. <HI>Every &s;in,</HI> both <HI>original,</HI> and actual, being a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the righteous law of God&punc; and contrary thereto, doth, in its own nature, bring <HI>guilt</HI> upon the &s;inner, whereby he is <HI>bound over to the wrath of God, and cur&s;e of
<PB N="10" REF="008100_0009_102E2A4C94D07DC0">
the law, and &s;o made jubject</HI> to death, with <HI>all mi&s;eries &s;piritual, temporal, and eternal.</HI></Q></P>
<P>In the <HI>Catechi&s;m,</HI> the evidence runs thus. <HI>Longer Ca|techi&s;m.</HI>
<Q><HI>Q.</HI> Did ALL mankind fall in that fir&s;t tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion</Q>
? that is, of our fir&s;t parents.
<Q><HI>A.</HI> The venant being made with <HI>Adam</HI> as a public per&s;on, not for him&s;elf only, but for <HI>his po&s;terity,</HI> ALL mankind, de&s;cending from him by ordinary genera|tion, &s;inned in him, and fell with him, in that fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. <HI>Q.</HI> Into what e&s;tate did the fall bring mankind? <HI>A.</HI> The fall bro't mankind into an e&s;tate of &s;in and mi&s;ery. <HI>Q.</HI> What mi&s;ery did the fall bring upon mankind? <HI>A.</HI> The fall bro't upon mankind the lo&s;s of communion with God, his di&s;plea&s;ure and cur&s;e, &s;o that they are by <HI>nature</HI> children of wrath, bond-&s;laves to &s;atan&punc; and JUST|LY LIABLE <HI>to all puni&s;hments in this world, and that which is to come. Q.</HI> What are the puni&s;h|ments of &s;in in the world to come? <HI>A.</HI> The pun|i&s;hments of &s;in in the world to come are everla&s;ting &s;eperation from the comfortable pre&s;ence of God&punc; and <HI>mo&s;t grievous torments in &s;oul and body, with|out intermi&s;&s;ion, in hell-fire for ever. Q.</HI> Did God leave all mankind to peri&s;h in the &s;tate of &s;in and mi&s;ery? <HI>A.</HI> God did not leave all men to peri&s;h in the e&s;tate of &s;in and mi&s;ery, <HI>into which they fell by the breach of the fir&s;t covenant,</HI>&mdash;but of <HI>his meer love and mercy</HI> delivereth his <HI>elect</HI> out of it, and bringeth them into an e&s;tate of &s;alvation by the &s;e|cond covenant, commonly called the covenant of grace.</Q>
The like que&s;tions are found in the <HI>&s;hor|ter Catechi&s;m,</HI> and the like an&s;wers are given to them, as is generally known to our children.</P>
<P>I have no need to be at the expence of any pains in
<PB N="11" REF="008100_0010_102E2A4FFB086570">
order to &s;hew you, that the above evidence is direct and full to the point in hand. If you will only tru&s;t your own eyes, you mu&s;t be convinced, that according to <HI>this Confe&s;&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>the&s;e Catechi&s;ms.</HI> THE WHOLE POSTERITY OF ADAM, all the de&s;cendants from him in the ordinary way, without exception or limitation, &s;o &s;inned in him, had his guilt &s;o imputed to them, as that, upon the account of <HI>this</HI> &s;in and guilt, they are <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> liable not only to temporal&punc; but <HI>eternal</HI> death; not only to mi&s;eries in this life, but to <HI>never-cea&s;ing torments in hell:</HI> And that they would all, in fact, have &s;uffered the&s;e <HI>eternal pains in hell</HI>&punc; if the grace of God&punc; thro' a redeemer, had not rendered it po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould e&s;cape them: which grace, being perfectly free and unde&s;erved, might have been with-held, and the whole human race, <HI>Adam</HI> with all his po&s;terity, left to peri&s;h <HI>everla&s;tingly in hell-fire.</HI></P>
<P>This, mo&s;t certainly, is the true real <HI>Calvini&s;tical orthodox</HI> doctrine of original &s;in, as it re&s;pects the im|putation of guilt: Nor can it be denied with a better grace, than that the &s;un &s;hines at noon day&punc; tho' it may be di&s;gui&s;ed, or kept out of &s;ight, if any valuable ends are to be an&s;wered thereby.</P>
<P N="2">2ndly, It remains now to &s;atisfy you, that this Gen|tleman has really de&s;erted the <HI>Calvini&s;tical</HI> doctrine in the above &s;en&s;e, yea, given it up into the hands of its enemies, yea, into the hands of the very author he is an&s;wering. This may &s;eem &s;trange; e&s;pecially as he was a volunteer in writing again&s;t one that had attacked the <HI>Orthodox</HI> doctrine in this &s;en&s;e, and &s;et it in an odi|ous light. But however &s;trange it may appear, it will&punc; I believe, upon examination, be found to be the real truth.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion, &s;tated by his Antagoni&s;t to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed
<PB N="12" REF="008100_0011_102E2A526AC4D270">
was this,
<Q>Whether we, and all <HI>Adam</HI>'s po&s;terity, are charged by God with this fir&s;t &s;in of his &s;o as that men, women and children are expo&s;ed, by this alone, to the eternal damnation of hell</Q>?
Whether this que&s;tion is &s;tated fairly, or unfairly, a thorough friend to <HI>Calvini&s;m</HI> would, one would think, have taken oc|ca&s;ion from it to a&s;&s;ert the liablene&s;s of all <HI>Adam</HI>'s po&s;|terity, infants as well as others, to the <HI>eternal damna|tion of hell,</HI> viewed as children of <HI>Adam,</HI> and under the imputation of his &s;in and guilt; and to labour in &s;hew|ing the con&s;i&s;tency of this doctrine with the perfections of God: But in&s;tead of a&s;&s;erting, or vindicating, this <HI>orthodox</HI> doctrine, this Gentleman &s;o &s;peaks upon it as really to give it up.</P>
<P>His finding fault with the &s;tate of the que&s;tion looks this way. If it had been &s;tated thus, "Whether all that have de&s;cended from <HI>Adam</HI> by ordinary generation are liable on account of every &s;in, both <HI>original</HI> and actual, to the pains of hell forever"; he could not have &s;aid it was unfairly &s;tated, without directly flying in the face of the <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter a&s;&s;embly,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>orthodox Calvini&s;tical</HI> doctrine upon this head is expre&s;&s;ed in their very words, no otherwi&s;e changed then by put|ting them into the form of a que&s;tion. And what is the difference, in real &s;en&s;e, between the que&s;tion as &s;tated by his <HI>Antagoni&s;t,</HI> and thus &s;tated from the <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-a&s;&s;embly?</HI> Are the words, "all <HI>Adam</HI>'s po&s;terity, men women and children," more exten&s;ive in their meaning, than "all that have de&s;cended from <HI>Adam</HI> by ordinary generation"? Surely, he will not &s;ay this. Are the words, "expo&s;ed to the eternal dam|nation of hell," &s;tronger than the&s;e, "liable to the pains of hell forever"? Neither will he pretend this. If therefore there is any unfairne&s;s in the &s;tate of the
<PB N="13" REF="008100_0012_102E2A5450362968">
que&s;tion, it mu&s;t be in the&s;e words, "by his &s;in alone"; but do the&s;e carry a different &s;en&s;e from tho&s;e, "every &s;in both ORIGINAL and actual"? The truth is, the que&s;tion is &s;tated according to the preci&s;e meaning of the <HI>orthodox</HI> doctrine; and it looks as tho' this Gen|tleman did not care to enter upon a vindication of it, as he thus finds fault with the que&s;tion to be debated.</P>
<P>But this will more fully appear by what he goes on to &s;ay. Tho' he owns, pag. 7. "the imputation of <HI>Adam</HI>'s &s;in to his po&s;terity, men, women and children"; yet, in the very next words, he denies this imputation in the full <HI>orthodox Calvini&s;tical</HI> &s;en&s;e. For he &s;ays,
<Q>Infants may be, and are, &s;ubject to the penal con&s;e|quences of the fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, viz. corruption of nature, pain, &s;ickne&s;s and death; in re&s;pect whereof it may be truly &s;aid to be imputed to them, &s;hould they not be thereby <HI>&s;ubject to eternal damnation.</HI></Q>
Compare this with the foregoing quotations, and judge, whether it agrees with the doctrine of <HI>Calvini&s;m.</HI> The doctrine of this Gentleman is, that &s;ome of <HI>Adam</HI>'s po&s;terity, namely infants, may not be &s;ubject to <HI>eternal damnation,</HI> tho' they may be &s;ubject to the <HI>penal con|&s;equences</HI> of his &s;in. The <HI>orthodox</HI> doctrine is, that the penal con&s;equence of the fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion is death <HI>eternal</HI> as well as temporal, the <HI>torments of hell-fire</HI> as well as the mi&s;eries of the pre&s;ent world; and that in|fants, unle&s;s they are not de&s;cended from <HI>Adam,</HI> have his guilt &s;o imputed to them as to be &s;ubject to all this puni&s;hment. In &s;hort, according to the doctrine re|ceived in the country, as that which is <HI>Orthodox,</HI> and <HI>Calvini&s;tical,</HI>" Every &s;in, original as well as actual, de&s;erves God's wrath and cur&s;e, both in this life, and that which is to come"; and con&s;equently, infants, if they are at all chargeable with original &s;in, are, in that
<PB N="14" REF="008100_0013_102E2A55DBFDCD50">
view of their ca&s;e, liable to the <HI>eternal damnation of hell.</HI></P>
<P>In the next page, he is &s;o far from &s;tanding up in defence of the <HI>Calvinian</HI> cau&s;e, even in the &s;en&s;e in which it was principally oppo&s;ed by his Antagoni&s;t, that he in&s;inuates as tho' <HI>eternal death,</HI> meaning thereby, an eternal privation of life, not including the <HI>torments of hell,</HI> was the mo&s;t any &s;uppo&s;e infants liable to. His words are the&s;e,
<Q>A thing [infants actually &s;uf|fering the torments of hell-fire] which few, or none maintain; even tho' <HI>&s;ome</HI> may &s;uppo&s;e them liable to eternal death, that is, an eternal privation of life; as they may be, and yet not &s;uffer the <HI>torments of hell.</HI></Q>
He is egregiou&s;ly mi&s;taken in the fir&s;t part of this &s;entence, as I &s;hall pre&s;ently have occa&s;ion to &s;hew you. But, in the latter, he has, to me unaccount|ably, &s;ub&s;tituted the private opinion of &s;uch men as Mr. <HI>Lock,</HI> and <HI>Taylor,</HI> in the room of the univer&s;ally known tenet of <HI>Calvini&s;m.</HI> What thoro' <HI>Calvini&s;t</HI> ever under&s;tood, by eternal death, <HI>meerly</HI> an eternal privation of life? I will be bold to affirm, that no one, who had not departed from the principles of <HI>Calvini&s;m,</HI> can be mentioned that explains this eternal death in any other &s;en&s;e, than including the <HI>torments of hell-fire.</HI> To be &s;ure, this is the &s;en&s;e in which it is to be un|der&s;tood in our <HI>Catechi&s;m,</HI> and <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of faith;</HI> in&s;omuch that the very children are acquainted with the di&s;tinction of death into temporal, &s;piritual, and <HI>eternal,</HI> meaning thereby <HI>eternal damnation.</HI></P>
<P>But this Gentleman has been more free &s;till with the <HI>orthodox Calvini&s;tical</HI> principle, upon the point under con&s;ideration. For he &s;ays plainly, in his mar|ginal note, page 8.
<Q>I could wi&s;h, that the latter part of the an&s;wer to the 19th que&s;tion of the <HI>A&s;|&s;embly's

&s;horter Catechi&s;m</HI> might be explained, &s;o as not to include tho&s;e who die in <HI>infancy</HI>; but to be under&s;tood of tho&s;e only of <HI>Adam</HI>'s po&s;terity, who, by indulging their natural corruption, in actual tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, render them&s;elves liable to the <HI>eternal pains of hell,</HI> as the utmo&s;t degree of mi&s;ery con&s;e|quent on the apo&s;tacy.</Q>
Being <HI>made liable to the pains of hell for ever</HI> is the part of this an&s;wer he wi&s;hes might be explained &s;o as not to include "tho&s;e who die in <HI>infancy.</HI>" If he means by this wi&s;h, that he would have this an&s;wer &s;o interpreted, as that people may be taught that there may be <HI>Elect</HI> infants as well as others, and that the&s;e may, of the meer good plea|&s;ure and free grace of God, thro' a redeemer, be de|livered <HI>from hell torments;</HI> this, I &s;uppo&s;e, is the ex|planation that is generally given this an&s;wer by well in|&s;tructed <HI>Calvini&s;ts;</HI> and there was no need of any wi&s;h in the ca&s;e.

And the&s;e words in the <HI>&s;horter Catechi&s;m</HI> are not the only ones he mu&s;t wi&s;h to be explained in a &s;en&s;e they don't contain, but a good many others in the <HI>longer Cate|chi&s;m,</HI> and <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of faith.</HI></P>
<P>In this &s;ame 8th pag. he affirms very peremptorily,
<PB N="16" REF="008100_0015_102E2A5C83710AE0">
that "we have no rea&s;on to conclude they [infants] &s;uffer the eternal torments of hell"; which affirmati|on, &s;o &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed, is the more &s;trange, as he in|troduces it, with what is previous to it, with this re|mark, "<HI>Secret things belong to God, but things re|vealed belong to us, and to our children.</HI>" 'Tis not a &s;ecret thing, in the opinion of <HI>Calvini&s;ts,</HI> that infants, as well as others, are ju&s;tly liable, viewed as the chil|dren of <HI>Adam,</HI> to the damnation of hell. That all <HI>Adam</HI>'s po&s;terity, upon the account of original &s;in, are liable to the pains of hell forever, is, with them, one of the <HI>things God has revealed to us, and to our chil|dren.</HI> Says the great <HI>Calvin,</HI> as I have met with the quotation, "Cunctos mortales in unius hominis per|&s;on&acirc; morti eternae mancipatos fui&s;&s;e, &s;criptura clamat." &mdash;That is, "that all mortals are held under the guilt of eternal death in the per&s;on of one man, is the loud voice of &s;cripture." And in this there is an univer&s;al agreement among <HI>Calvini&s;ts.</HI> But whether God, it being a matter of meer good plea&s;ure, will, thro' a re|deemer, deliver all infants from that eternal damnation, they de&s;erve, and are liable to, is the <HI>&s;ecret thing</HI> with <HI>Calvini&s;ts.</HI> I don't know of one thoro' <HI>Calvini&s;t,</HI> be|&s;ides this Gentleman, that &s;ays in the peremptory man|ner he does, "we have no rea&s;on to conclude they will &s;uffer the eternal torments of hell." The contrary is rather their opinion, that is, that &s;ome of them, at lea&s;t, will in fact &s;uffer <HI>eternal damnation</HI>; as will be made evident to you by and bye.</P>
<P>Not that I blame this Gentleman for hoping the be&s;t concerning the future &s;tate of <HI>infants:</HI> Nor do I find any fault with him, I rather think the better of him, for not &s;aying, with <HI>Calvini&s;ts,</HI> that the fir&s;t &s;in is &s;o imputed to them, as that they are liable to the damna|tion

of hell, and might ju&s;tly have it inflicted on them, if he don't believe it.

<P>In &s;hort, from what has been already offered, with|out troubling my&s;elf, or you, with any more citations, you will, I think, be fairly led to apprehend, that, ac|cording to the notion this Gentleman entertains of the imputation of <HI>Adam</HI>'s guilt to his po&s;terity, they are not, <HI>meerly</HI> or <HI>&s;olely,</HI> on this account, &s;ubject to that <HI>eternal damnation in hell,</HI> with which his &s;in was threatned; which, I am &s;ure, is not the doctrine of <HI>Calvini&s;m,</HI> but directly contradictory to it. For which rea&s;on, a con&s;iderable part of his book is no vindication of the <HI>Calvini&s;tical</HI> doctrine in this point, nor an&s;wer to the author he wrote again&s;t, as this was the <HI>&s;pecial</HI> point of <HI>Calvini&s;m</HI> which he attacked. And, as it ap|pears to me, this Gentleman, no more than his Anta|goni&s;t, is a friend to the <HI>Calvini&s;tical</HI> doctrine, as it maintains <HI>the liablene&s;s of all</HI> Adam'<HI>s po&s;terity, with|out exception, on account of his fir&s;t &s;in, to the eternal damnation of hell;</HI> which was the very thing propo|&s;ed by that writer to be debated.</P>
<P>As I ob&s;erved at fir&s;t, this Gentleman's book was, to my apprehen&s;ion, in &s;ome parts, ambiguous and dark, however clear it might be to others of deeper penetra|tion: For which rea&s;on, 'tis po&s;&s;ible I may have mi&s;|taken his &s;entiments. If this &s;hould be the truth, this letter may be a kindne&s;s to him, as I know you intend to make it public. Others, I have conver&s;ed with, if I am mi&s;taken, are mi&s;taken al&s;o. And he will now
<PB N="18" REF="008100_0017_102E2A5FEBEC7220">
have an opportunity, if he believes the <HI>Calvini&s;tical</HI> doctrine of the imputation of <HI>Adam</HI>'s guilt to all his po&s;terity in the &s;en&s;e of our <HI>Catechi&s;ms</HI>&punc; and the <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter confe&s;&s;ion of faith,</HI> more explicitly to &s;ay &s;o; and to &s;upply an e&s;&s;ential defect in his book, con&s;ider|ed as an an&s;wer to <HI>the Winter Evening's Conver&s;ation,</HI> I mean the want of a particular and full vindication of this doctrine, as maintained in the&s;e <HI>Catechi&s;ms</HI> and <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of faith,</HI> again&s;t the charge of its being in|con&s;i&s;tent with the ju&s;tice and mercy of God.</P>
<P>Nor is the good hope he has of the &s;alvation of all that die in <HI>infancy</HI> any objection again&s;t this, if he is a &s;ound and thoro' <HI>Calvini&s;t.</HI> For their being <HI>eventu|ally</HI> &s;aved, or damned, will make no alteration, logi|cally &s;peaking, in the force of the arguments either to prove, or di&s;prove, the con&s;i&s;tency of the <HI>Calvini&s;tical</HI> doctrine with the perfections of God. Even upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that all that die in infancy are &s;aved, this doctrine cannot be true, to me it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be true, if it was not con&s;i&s;tent with the per|fections of God everla&s;tingly to have damned them all. For the doctrine is, that they de&s;erve damnation; that they are liable to it, as chargeable with the guilt of the fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; and that, if they are not <HI>eventually</HI> damned, it is owing to the meer good plea&s;ure, and free grace of God, which might not have been di&s;pen&s;ed towards them. But the&s;e cannot be truths, if in the previous rea&s;on of things, it would have been incon&s;i&s;|tent with the ju&s;tice and other perfections of God, to have eternally damned them. The &s;uppo&s;ing there|fore that all that die in infancy are &s;aved is no vindica|tion of the <HI>Calvini&s;tical</HI> doctrine upon the head under debate. In true rea&s;on, &s;eperate from pa&s;&s;ion, affecti|on, and imagination, the objected difficulties are pre|ci&s;ely

the &s;ame, as if it be &s;uppo&s;ed that they are <HI>even|tually</HI> damned. I could therefore wi&s;h this Gentle|man, notwith&s;tanding his hoping &s;o well of tho&s;e who die in infancy, had gone particularly and largely into a reconciliation of the <HI>Calvini&s;tical</HI> doctrine, as oppo&s;ed by his Antagoni&s;t, with the perfections of God.

I profe&s;s an e&s;teem for the Reverend Clergymen who have &s;igned it; tho' I can't &s;ay, that I think they are infallible.

concerning original &s;in. Hear what he &s;ays. In his commentary on <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.17, having ob&s;erved, that there were two differences between Chri&s;t and <HI>Adam,</HI> and having de&s;cribed the fir&s;t, he goes on,
<Q>The other is, that the benefit by Chri&s;t does not come to all men, as <HI>Adam</HI> involved his whole kind in <HI>damnation.</HI> And the rea&s;on is in readine&s;s; for &s;ince the cur&s;e we draw from <HI>Adam</HI> is derived to us by nature, it is not to be wondered, if it embraces the whole ma&s;s: But that we may participate of the grace of Chri&s;t, it is needful we &s;hould be united to him by faith. Therefore that you may po&s;&s;e&s;s the mi&s;erable inhe|ritance of &s;in, it is enough that you are a man; for it re&s;ides in fle&s;h and blood. That you may enjoy the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, it is nece&s;&s;ary to be a man endowed with faith, becau&s;e fellow&s;hip with him is obtained by faith. This is communicated to <HI>infants</HI> in a peculiar way; for they have in the co|venant the right of adoption, by which they pa&s;s into the communion of Chri&s;t.

<P>I am ready to think, it appears pretty plain to you by this time, that the&s;e Gentlemen were mi&s;taken. Whether they will entertain this apprehen&s;ion of the matter, I know not; but this I am well &s;atisfied of, that they will not be free to declare, "that they are deeply concerned to find the &s;cripture-doctrine of orig|inal &s;in mi&s;-repre&s;ented and derided," by the la&s;t quo|ted author. And if not, why &s;hould they &s;ay this of the author of the <HI>Winter Evening's Conver&s;ation</HI> for
<PB N="26" REF="008100_0025_102E2A74C19D6420">
con&s;idering infants, in the cour&s;e of his arguments, as &s;uffering in the fire of hell?</P>
<P>But &s;hould it be even &s;uppo&s;ed, that the&s;e Gentle|men were not mi&s;taken in the fact we have been con|&s;idering, is it not very extraordinary, when they had &s;o fair an occa&s;ion to give their atte&s;tation to the known <HI>orthodox</HI> doctrine, that infants, as well as others, de|&s;erve the damnation of hell, and are ju&s;tly liable to it, as chargeable with the guilt of the fir&s;t &s;in; I &s;ay, is it not &s;trange, that they &s;hould omit dropping a word in&s;inuating the truth of this great <HI>Calvini&s;tical</HI> point: E&s;pecially, as they took care to give their readers to under&s;tand, that the <HI>orthodox</HI> doctrine did not &s;o much as "IMPLY that children dying in infancy &s;uffered the torments of hell for this fir&s;t &s;in." May not weak well-minded people be in danger of being hereby tur|ned a&s;ide from what they e&s;teem the truth of &s;cripture? If I am not mi&s;informed, &s;ome of the&s;e Gentlemen have found fault with others, and rebuked them too, for withholding the truth, when they had a fair occa|&s;ion to &s;peak to it. And the occa&s;ion here loudly cal|led upon them to &s;peak; for if they were at the pains carefully to read the book they recommended, before they &s;igned the preface to it, 'tis difficult to conceive how they could avoid &s;eeing, that the true <HI>Calvini&s;tical</HI> doctrine, as it re&s;pects the liablene&s;s of all <HI>Adam</HI>'s po&s;|terity to the torments of hell, on account of his &s;in, was rather oppo&s;ed than a&s;&s;erted, or vindicated. And yet, they leave this important point altogether untoucht, or rather &s;o &s;peak upon infants not &s;uffering the tor|ments of hell, as to endanger people's being led to think they were not liable to them, in any view what|ever. I can't but e&s;teem this a great omi&s;&s;ion in &s;uch Gentlemen.</P>
<P>There is one thing more that has given me &s;ome &s;ur|pri&s;e.
<PB N="27" REF="008100_0026_102E2A772D5D0980">
It is this. They
<Q>;&s;olemnly advi&s;e and entreat the churches, whenever vacant, to beware of &s;ettling any man in the pa&s;toral office, who does not profe&s;s a firm belief of the great doctrine here defended, and the other important articles of our holy religion dependent on it, or connected with it.</Q>
A man may firmly believe the doctrine here defended, and all o|ther articles connected with it, and not believe with our <HI>Catechi&s;ms,</HI> and the <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter confe&s;&s;ion of faith,</HI> that all <HI>Adam</HI>'s po&s;terity are liable to the damnation of hell, as chargeable with the guilt of his fir&s;t &s;in: And yet, in con&s;i&s;tency with the &s;olemn advice of the&s;e Gentlemen, any vacant church might &s;ettle him in the pa&s;toral office over them. What will a late venerable <HI>orthodox</HI> Council &s;ay to this, who &s;olemnly advi&s;ed one of our churches to di&s;mi&s;s their pa&s;tor, as unfit to be any longer their pa&s;tor, if not upon this charge only, upon this as a principal one, namely,
<Q>that he did not think it con&s;i&s;tent with the ju&s;tice and mercy of God eternally to damn any of <HI>Adam</HI>'s po&s;terity, MEERLY upon the account of his fir&s;t &s;in.</Q>
Surely, if a man may be &s;ettled in the pa&s;toral office, tho' he don't be|lieve <HI>Adam</HI>'s po&s;terity are liable to the torments of hell, <HI>meerly</HI> on account of his fir&s;t &s;in, it ought to be no rea&s;onable objection again&s;t his being continued in it, that he can't &s;ee the con&s;i&s;tency of this doctrine with the ju&s;tice and mercy of God.&mdash;But I &s;hall leave that Council, and the&s;e Gentlemen, to &s;ettle this point between them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I have now given you my opinion, with the grounds of it; and might ea&s;ily have enlarged this letter into the bulk of a book of 156 pages, but that I tho't it be&s;t not to be lengthy. Judge for your&s;elf, and do it impartially.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="008100_0027_102E2A7AC5D69930">I only add, I heartily join with the&s;e Gentlemen in praying, that
<Q>this people and their offspring may be <HI>nouri&s;hed up in the words of faith and good doc|trine;</HI> and that <HI>the faith once delivered to the &s;aints</HI> may be pre&s;erved pure and entire in the churches, throughout all generations.</Q></P>
