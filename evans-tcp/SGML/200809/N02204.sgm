<P>THEY that fir&s;t &s;et up, as the Spreaders of the Go&s;pel, and to give their te&s;timony to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his Doctrine, had &s;een little be&s;ide Boats and Men: a few illiterate <HI>Fi&s;hermen</HI> with a <HI>Publican</HI> and <HI>Tent maker;</HI> a &s;trange under|taking, for &s;uch unaccompli&s;hed Orators, to try to con|vert the World to <HI>Christ,</HI> and to &s;ubject the powerful, learned and wi&s;e, to the foot of a crucified Per&s;on! but they forgot not Chri&s;t's parting Promi&s;e, Mat. 28.20. <HI>Go ye therefore &amp; teach all nations; &mdash; and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.</HI> And fail|ed not to lean on <HI>Divine Aids and A&s;&s;i&s;tance;</HI> which brought the matter on to a wonderful Per&s;ection, in a lit|tle time; tho' they met with not only cold entertain|ment: but damping repul&s;e, and har&s;h treatment, when they fir&s;t preached Chri&s;t, to an ignorant, depraved, athe|i&s;tical and infidel World; as the Text intimates; which &s;ets forth, the bitter charge lay'd upon <HI>Paul &amp; Silas,</HI> for only Scripture rea&s;oning concerning Chri&s;t, and his Re&s;ur|rection. The charge lay'd upon them, by the implacable outragious <HI>Jews,</HI> was, as if they went about only upon a &s;editious De&s;ign, &amp; as <HI>State troublers;</HI> when they &s;ought <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> wor&s;e thing, than to per&s;uade the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians,</HI>

But the&s;e (the only Tumult and Uproar-makers of that Day;) continue the Charge, <HI>v.</HI> 7. for that they brought in <HI>Customs contrary to</HI> Cae&s;ar'<HI>s.</HI> Whereas, the&s;e Servants of God, try'd to advance the &s;piritual Kingdom of Chri&s;t, without the lea&s;t Injury <HI>to the Roman Empire:</HI> that the <HI>Jews</HI> knew to be &s;o in their Con&s;ciences; but ca&s;t the wic|ked A&s;per&s;ion on them, to make them odious to the peo|ple; and pretended regard <HI>to</HI> Cae&s;ar'<HI>s Decrees,</HI> only to ruin Chri&s;t's <HI>Servants,</HI> and hinder the Go&s;pel: whereas the <HI>traduced per&s;ons,</HI> honoured the <HI>Emperor,</HI> pray'd for his Life, for a pro&s;perous Reign, and valiant Armies; a faithful <HI>Senate,</HI> di&s;creet Coun&s;el, a good People, and a quiet World.

<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<Q><HI>That the Go&s;pel it&s;elf, when fir&s;t advanced in the World, and the first Preachers of it, had a formida|ble Outcry rai&s;ed upon them.</HI></Q>
<P>The Malignant world, did not know how to &s;peak bad eno', and contemptuou&s;ly eno' hereof they tho't. What &s;corn and hard frumps had <HI>Paul</HI> and his Doctrine from the <HI>Athenian Philo&s;ophers?</HI> v.18. <HI>Some &s;aid what will this babbler &s;ay? other &s;ome, He &s;eemeth to be a &s;etter Forth of &s;trange gods,</HI> &amp;c. The Apo&s;tles offered nothing more har&s;h to Rea&s;on, than convincing proofs, <HI>that Chri&s;t was the appointed, and expected Me&s;&s;iah to come &amp; &s;ave the world; and irrefragable Confirmations of the truth of his Re&s;urrection, that mon might be per&s;uaded, they had a living Saviour to trust in;</HI> and that they might quit the vices &s;poken of in Rom. 1.30.1 Cor. 6.10. Tit. 3.3. Gal. 5.21.2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.2. <HI>And get wa&s;hed, &s;anctified, justified,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And appear with the &s;pirit of love, joy, peace, long &s;uffering, gentlene&s;s, goodne&s;s, faithfulne&s;s, meekne&s;s, temperance and the like, as a proof that they had clo&s;ed with the Saviour of the world, as their Head and Saviour.</HI> And could this hurt any, need it to have di&s;turbed any! Yet har&s;h and very unwelcome treatment, had the Go&s;pel and the fir&s;t Preachers of it, when Chri&s;t
<PB N="5" REF="002627_0005_0FDB8029F4BF72D0">any more in&s;tance of this thing, it is but turning back to what the <HI>Apostles,</HI> at their fir&s;t &s;etting into the <HI>Mini&s;try,</HI> met with, Acts 4.18. &amp; 5.40. That was the un|pardonable Crime, viz. to preach Chri&s;t <HI>crucified;</HI> for fear men &s;hould get into a new &amp; better way of Salvation, than that of <HI>following their fooli&s;h &s;uperstitions, the Command|ments of men,</HI> that brought more gain to them, than pro|fit to any body el&s;e &mdash;. Thus Chri&s;tianity notwith|&s;tanding its brightne&s;s and purity, was not only expos'd naked in the day of its Birth, but made odious to the People.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>Whence was it thus?</HI></P>
<P N="1">An&s;. 1. <HI>The first Preachers of the Go&s;pel, were not &s;uch promi&s;ing, taking, quaint men.</HI> This was the ex|ception again&s;t <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.4. <HI>And my &s;peech, &amp; my preach|ing was not with enticing words of mans wi&s;dom, but in demonstration of the Spirit, and of power.</HI> Which the A|po&s;tle acknowledged, under the <HI>Denomination of infirmi|ty in the fle&s;h,</HI> Gal. 4 13. A crucified Chri&s;t was the Rhetorick! The <HI>Roman Empire</HI> was now at its height, <HI>Philo&s;ophy &amp; Eloquence</HI> in its flower &amp; vigour, and the <HI>Sages</HI> of that time pu&s;h'd again&s;t the Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t and their Doctrine with their might, as fine undertakers (to &s;peak ironically) to new model the World. (Say they) No, the me&s;&s;ages of God him&s;elf &s;hall be &s;lighted, if brought by &s;uch hands: like as the <HI>Emulation</HI> &s;hewed it&s;elf at the time of the <HI>Reformation,</HI> under <HI>Luther</HI>'s preaching, when many <HI>Church Dignitarys &amp; Eccle&s;ia&s;|ticks</HI> could not but own, that &s;undry things wanted Re|formation in the Church, but could not bear it &s;hould be lead on by a &s;orry <HI>Monk.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Go&s;pel in its Doctrine &amp; De&s;ign is very con|trary to men's Lusts.</HI> And hence might proceed the op|po&s;ition made unto it. This corrupt nature is very fond of, &amp; doth not know how to away with the hard &s;ayings of the Go&s;pel about them, <HI>to deny them&s;elves, &amp; take up their cro&s;s, plucking out a right eye, leaving mammon, and laying up trea&s;ure on Earth, giving liberally to the poor, &amp; depending upon Heavenly Refundments, loving
<PB N="6" REF="002627_0006_0FDB802B838D0EC0">Christ,</HI> &amp;c. which makes &s;ome go away from the hearing <HI>with damp, as the young man, who when he heard that &s;aying, went away &s;orrowful, for he had great po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</HI> Mat. 9.22. And others &s;et up with bold rages, and try to &s;purn at the Go&s;pel, and run over it.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Meerly for its newne&s;s the Go&s;pel might be excepted again&s;t.</HI> For our nature is apt to be fond of things we have had a long Intimacy with, and apt to recoyl at In|novation, if never &s;o much for the better. So you &s;hall &s;ee &s;ome fond of an old hou&s;e, 8 hou&s;e implements, cloaths, hats &amp;c. and if tho&s;e that are never &s;o much better &amp; more u&s;eful, be offered in their room, they are &s;lighted, becau&s;e tho&s;e they have had &s;uch long acquaintance with, are &s;o dear to them. So their old <HI>Super&s;titions,</HI> corrupt <HI>Cu&s;toms</HI> and <HI>Idolatries,</HI> the infidel world would not part with, for a <HI>&s;ound Go&s;pel</HI> &mdash;</P>
<P>USE. <HI>Hence the best things that God has &s;ent us in|to the World may be mi&s;construed &amp; mi&s;repre&s;ented.</HI> When God &s;ent Chri&s;t into the World, &s;ome &s;aid he was a <HI>friend of Publicans &amp; Sinners,</HI> &amp; held a compact with <HI>Belzebub,</HI> to &s;lur &amp; bla&s;pheme his mighty works. And the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> was by &s;ome reputed <HI>babbling, &amp; a &s;etting forth of strange gods.</HI> And the Apo&s;tles, <HI>who&s;e feet &s;hou'd have been beautiful, for bringing the glad &amp; gracious tidings of peace &amp; reconciliation by Christ, they were counted pestilent fellows &amp; mad men.</HI> But &s;urely this ought not &s;o to be. This was one effect of the mi&s;con|duct of Rea&s;on depraved, &amp; benighted with the fall, that in &s;ome ca&s;es it no better di&s;cerned good from evil. Whence I would take occa&s;ion, to offer to the Con&s;ciences of &s;ome Neighbours &amp; Brethren, that appear not &s;o well &s;atisfied, a|bout the E&s;&s;ay of Regulation &amp; Amendment, of the defects of our <HI>public P&s;almody,</HI> &amp; to have too <HI>tort &amp; &s;mart</HI> Objections, viz. that they may mi&s;s it, &amp; <HI>offend against the generation of the ju&s;t,</HI> tho' they &s;eem to be pretty &s;ure to them&s;elves; That I am well per&s;uaded, 'ere this Generation pa&s;s away, thou&s;ands upon better con&s;ideration, will &s;ee rea&s;on to re|tract precipitant Cen&s;ures, on con&s;cionable endeavours, to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the religious Intere&s;ts of <HI>New Engli&s;h Churches,</HI> by
<PB N="7" REF="002627_0007_0FDB15D9B48BBC88">to them, lead wrong in an affair of this Nature. But <HI>they have &s;o learned Christ,</HI> and &s;o they under&s;tand the Go&s;pel, as they have held forth to you, relating to this Subject. And in relation to &s;omething further that may be added on this head, I would premi&s;e,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That I can't &s;ee there &s;hould be any holine&s;s in a Tune; tho' there be holine&s;s in the matter of a &s;acred Song, to which a Tune is required when it is &s;ung.</HI> Sing|ing I take to be but melodious reading, &amp; who can &s;hew an In&s;titution for the &s;pecial moding a Service; nor &s;hould any mi&s;take from the propinquity of a <HI>Tune,</HI> to the matter of a <HI>&s;acred Song,</HI> to the mingling and counting that which is <HI>unhallowed,</HI> with that which is <HI>holy</HI>&mdash;. The <HI>grave Tunes</HI> u&s;ed in foreign Churches, are no more <HI>holy</HI> than ours, nor ours, than theirs; for tho' the <HI>Bible</HI> be an <HI>holy Book</HI> on all con&s;iderations, yet the <HI>Cover</HI> put on only to pre&s;erve, and put honour thereon, none can imagine <HI>to be holy.</HI> And tho' Chri&s;t put honour on a certain <HI>Tune,</HI> (if we knew which of them it was) that he u&s;ed to &s;ing an <HI>Hymn</HI> with, at the head of his family, &amp; at the fir&s;t Admini&s;tration of the &s;econd New Te&s;tament Sacrament, &amp; la&s;t public Ser|vice he was in on Earth, yet I don't conceive that hereby he put <HI>holine&s;s</HI> thereinto. And &s;uppo&s;e it to be as likely that he u&s;ed then one of tho&s;e <HI>Tunes,</HI> that are now excep|ted again&s;t by &s;ome, as any other; wherefore I would not have any go too fa&s;t in rejecting, or putting a &s;light upon any particular <HI>Tune,</HI> that is u&s;ed in the Churches, &amp; appro|ved by the skilful, learned &amp; judicious, lea&s;t (inverting Luk. 16 15. for a &s;ea&s;onable check here) they be found <HI>abominat|ing that which is approv'd in Heaven, &amp; was u&s;ed by Chri&s;t in his Family on Earth.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Singing is partly a natural, &amp; partly an acquired Gift.</HI> The <HI>To canere,</HI> or <HI>po&s;&s;e canendi,</HI> is concreated with us; the <HI>Ars canendi</HI> is an acqui&s;ition by practice, &amp; God's ble&s;&s;ing thereon. The <HI>po&s;&s;e</HI> of &s;inging is in-lay'd with us by the God of nature, (together with the <HI>&s;eeing Eye &amp; hear|ing Ear,</HI> Prov. 10.12.) And which Singers ri&s;e to &s;ome ex|pertne&s;s in u&s;ing, by the Divine ble&s;&s;ing, on their reading and hearing the Rules of &s;inging, &amp; practi&s;ing thereon, and by minding &amp; conforming to the Voices of them that were

<P N="3">3 <HI>It is a good Gift from the Father of Lights if any can Sing well.</HI> Jam. 1.17 <HI>Every good gift, &amp; every per|fect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of Lights, &amp;c.</HI> And he that &s;et up <HI>Solomon</HI> to &s;hine with wi&s;dom in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> made <HI>David</HI> eminently skilful this way, among his people; in which re&s;pect, as in many be&s;ide he &s;erved his Generation; for <HI>the di&s;pen&s;ation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal,</HI> be he Prince or Sub|ject: And <HI>as every one hath received the Gift,</HI> let him be a Civil or Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Ruler; <HI>&s;o let him minifier the &s;ame, that God in all things might be glorified.</HI> By what I can learn from the <HI>lively Oracles, David</HI> (&amp; no doubt by Hea|vens direction) was the fir&s;t that introduced <HI>&s;inging</HI> into the Church of God, that a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the devotion of the godly; and I take him to be at the head of the Regulation of the <HI>&s;acred Mu&s;ick,</HI> for <HI>Harmony &amp; Concord</HI> at that glo|rious <HI>Solemnity</HI> of removing the <HI>Ark to the cho&s;en place for it.</HI> 1 Chron. 15.16, 22.
