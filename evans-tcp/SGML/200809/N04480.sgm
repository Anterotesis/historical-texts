<P>O &s;ing unto the Lord a new Song, for he hath done marvellous Things: His right Hand and his holy Arm hath gotten him the Victory.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS we are now together in the Hou&s;e of the Lord, to pay him our humble and grateful Acknow|ledgments for the eminent Succe&s;s which he has granted the <HI>New England</HI> Arms again&s;t a neigh|bouring powerful Enemy, I could think of no Words more pertinent than tho&s;e I have read to you to employ your Meditations on &s;o remarkable an Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>SOME indeed refer them to the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and his &s;piritual Conque&s;ts in behalf of a rebel World; but others think they were penned in commemoration of &s;ome &s;ignal tem|poral Victory gain'd by the Troops of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> under the Command of <HI>David,</HI> over their Enemies. In this View of them they are properly applicable to the De&s;ign of this Day's Solemnity; for <HI>the Lord hath done marvellous Things</HI> for us; <HI>His right Hand and holy Arm hath gotten him the Victory</HI>: And we are hereupon obliged to <HI>&s;ing a new &s;ong</HI> to the Prai&s;e of his great Name.</P>
<P><PB REF="005558_0004_1018681F3461BAA0">IN &s;peaking to the Words,</P>
<P N="1">I. I &s;hall con&s;ider God as <HI>getting the Victory by his right Hand and holy Arm.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. I &s;hall take Notice of the <HI>marvellous Things</HI> which he &s;ometimes does in <HI>getting the Victory.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. I &s;hall &s;how what Rea&s;on a People, for whom God has thus gotten the Victory, have to <HI>&s;ing a new Song</HI> of Prai&s;e to him.</P>
<P>THESE are the Heads we are naturally led to di&s;cour&s;e to from the Text: And we &s;hall endeavour to &s;peak to them in a Manner not un&s;utable to the Occa&s;ion of the Day, and Circum&s;tances of divine Providence.</P>
<P N="1">I. I am, in the fir&s;t Place, to con&s;ider <HI>God</HI> as <HI>getting the Victory by his right Hand and holy Arm.</HI> The in&s;pired <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> a&s;cribes this Glory to him. He does not take it to him&s;elf, he does not be&s;tow it on the Troops of <HI>I&s;rael</HI>; but acknowledges the Efficiency of God, and gives him the Honour due to his Name. <HI>His right Hand and holy Arm hath gotten him the Victory.</HI> Literally &s;peaking it cannot be &s;aid of God, that he has an <HI>Hand</HI> or <HI>Arm</HI>; for he is a pure Spirit, without bodily Shape or Parts: But as 'tis by the <HI>right Hand and Arm</HI> that Men are wont to put forth their Strength, the&s;e Parts of the human Body are figuratively applied to God. So he is &s;aid in the Text to <HI>get him the Victory by his right Hand and Arm.</HI> The Lan|guage is u&s;ed by way of Accommodation to our Capacities, and obviou&s;ly leads us to conceive of Victory as obtain'd by God, bro't about under the Direction and Influence of his powerwful and alwi&s;e Providence.</P>
<P>AND this is a Truth every where acknowledged in the &s;acred Writings. They &s;peak of the great God as ruling in the Armies of Heaven and Earth; as pre&s;iding over the Kingdoms of this lower World, governing all their
<PB N="7" REF="005558_0005_101868210A4B6BF8">
Affairs, and deciding all their Battles. The Names by which he is commonly known in the Bible are the&s;e, <HI>the Lord of Ho&s;ts, the God of Armies, the Lord &s;trong and migh|ty, the Lord mighty in Battle</HI>; importing, that he directs, pre&s;ides and over-rules in all Armies, &s;o as to turn the Battle on which Side he plea&s;es. Nor is Victory ever ob|tained but under the divine Guidance and Ble&s;&s;ing. 'Tis in the Faith of this, that <HI>David,</HI> the <HI>General,</HI> as well as <HI>King</HI> of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> &s;o often applies to God to be his Shield and Help, and &s;ubdue the People under him. 'Tis in the Faith of this, that the <HI>I&s;rael</HI> of God do &s;o often make their religious thankful Acknowledgments to him for giving them the Necks of their Enemies. And 'tis upon this &s;ame Account, that we meet with &s;o many &s;acred Hymns of Prai&s;e, in Commemoration of glorious Victory in a Day of Battle.</P>
<P>NOT that God, in getting the Victory, <HI>immediately</HI> exerts his <HI>right Hand and holy Arm.</HI> He does it <HI>ordinarily</HI> by the intervention of &s;econd Cau&s;es, and of &s;uch as are naturally fitted, in a humane Way, to accompli&s;h his Pur|po&s;es: Tho' this ought not, in the lea&s;t, to take from him the Glory of his Agency; for the Victory is notwith&s;tanding his. He rai&s;es up and qualifies tho&s;e who are employed in a Day of Battle, he Spirits them to the Service, arms them with Re&s;olution, directs their Conduct, and crowns their Va|lor with Succe&s;s. The greate&s;t Generals are ab&s;olutely de|pendant on God. He gives them Pre&s;ence of mind, or confounds their Tho'ts; he directs their Coun&s;els, or &s;uffers them to be led a&s;ide by a Spirit of Infatuation; he renders their Projections pro&s;perous, or fru&s;trates their be&s;t concer|ted Mea&s;ures: He gives Courage to their Armies, or &s;trikes them with Surpri&s;e: And if he intends to render them victorious, he will order &s;uch a concurrence of Cir|cum&s;tances in their Favour, as that they &s;hall have the Advantage of their Enemies, and tread upon their High Places.</P>
<P>AND now, if 'its by the <HI>right Hand and holy Arm of God;</HI> that victory is obtained,</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="005558_0006_10186822DE1F78B8">THIS &s;hews us where our <HI>Dependance</HI> ought to be for Succe&s;s again&s;t our Enemies. Not on the be&s;t Means, or In&s;truments: Tho' we ought to make u&s;e of the&s;e, and may depend on them, provided we don't place them in the Room of God. For he is <HI>principally</HI> and <HI>ultimately</HI> to be confided in. And cur&s;ed is the Man, the Nation, the Province, that maketh Fle&s;h their Arm. The Lord Jehovah, and he only, is the Strength of his People; and whatever Tru&s;t is placed in Men or Means, it ought always to be in &s;ubordination to his all-governing Will and Providence.</P>
<P>AND 'tis owing, I would hope, to &s;uch a well-placed Tru&s;t in God, that we his People in this Land have been favoured with &s;uch remarkable Succe&s;s again&s;t our Ene|mies. We were not wanting in the U&s;e of all &s;utable Means; and yet, I could not but ob&s;erve a general Di&s;po|&s;ition in all &s;erious People, both high and low, to own their Dependance on God, without the concurrent Ble&s;&s;ing of who&s;e Providence, they had no Hope of Succe&s;s. It was this that brought us once and again publickly into the Hou&s;e of the Lord, under the Countenance of Authority, to humble our&s;elves before him, to confe&s;s our Sins, and beg that his Pre&s;ence might be with our Brethren gone again&s;t the Enemy. And upon no Occa&s;ion do I remem|ber to have &s;een a Spirit of Prayer more generally prevail|ing among tho&s;e who profe&s;s a Regard to Religion. Fer|vent Prayers were continually going up to God, from all Parts of the Country: And may it not be hoped, that God has heard our Prayers of Faith and Tru&s;t in his Power and Goodne&s;s, and, in An&s;wer to them, crowned our En|terprize again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> Enemy with &s;uch &s;ignal Glory and Victory?</P>
<P>WE are likewi&s;e taught from what has been di&s;cour&s;ed, that the <HI>Glory</HI> of Victories gained over Enemies is to be given unto God. To him therefore let us a&s;cribe the Glory of our late Conque&s;t, &s;o nearly connected with the Pro&s;perity of the&s;e Colonies. 'Twas by the <HI>right Hand and holy Arm of God</HI> that we got this Victory: And to him be the Prai&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="005558_0007_101868291C53C908">NOT that we are to be unmindful of tho&s;e whom God has been plea&s;ed to u&s;e as In&s;truments in this great Affair. 'Tis the Command of God, that we give Honour to whom Honour is due. And &s;hall we not think and &s;peak of tho&s;e, with all decent Re&s;pect, and entertain a graceful Sen&s;e of their Service, who have expo&s;ed them&s;elves to Hard&s;hips, and ventured their Lives in the high Places of the Field, for our Benefit; e&s;pecially, when they have been honored by God in being made victorious over our Ene|mies? All Nations have done Honour to their <HI>Heroes,</HI> both living and after they were dead: And if they have &s;ometimes exceeded herein, giving that Glory to <HI>Man</HI> which was due to <HI>God,</HI> this is no Rea&s;on why we &s;hould not make our grateful Acknowledgments to our <HI>Warri|ours,</HI> and in Proportion to the Extent and Value of their Atchievements on our Behalf, and the greatne&s;s of the Ha|zards and Difficulties they have gone thro' for our Sakes; always provided we keep within the Bounds of Religion, and honor not <HI>Man</HI> in Oppo&s;ition to <HI>God,</HI> but in &s;ub&s;ervi|ency to him, and <HI>ultimately</HI> reflecting Glory on him.</P>
<P>IT has been remarked, the Song of <HI>Deborah,</HI> tho' it gives the principal Glory of the eminent Victory it cele|brates to God, who&s;e is the Glory, and the Power, and the Victory, and the Maje&s;ty; yet at the &s;ame Time it forgets not to give all ju&s;t Applau&s;e to the Officers and Troops that acquired it under the divine Conduct and Ble&s;&s;ing. A good Example this! and we may learn our Duty from it both to <HI>God,</HI> and tho&s;e he has employed as <HI>In&s;truments</HI> in the glorious Conque&s;t we are this Duty celebrating.</P>
<P>WE ought highly to e&s;teem in Love and honour his <HI>Excellency,</HI> our <HI>Commander in Chief,</HI> who&s;e Wi&s;dom pro|jected this great and nece&s;&s;ary Undertaking; who&s;e Pru|dence directed to all &s;utable Mea&s;ures to conceal it from the Enemy; who&s;e indefatigable Labours, by Night and Day, carried it on with &s;uch &s;urpri&s;ing Di&s;patch; and, in a Word, who&s;e ju&s;t Influence at <HI>Home,</HI> and &s;ea&s;onable Ap|plications there, procured tho&s;e Ships of War, without which we could not have &s;ucceeded in this noble De&s;ign.
<PB N="10" REF="005558_0008_1018682E0705B2F0">
He has herein approved him&s;elf faithful to his <HI>Royal Ma&s;ter,</HI> and a Father to NEW-ENGLAND. The good Lord <HI>have re&s;pect</HI> to his Servant! And may he long live at the <HI>head</HI> of this <HI>Province,</HI> in high Favour with the <HI>King,</HI> and rejoicing in the Love Reverence and Obei&s;ance of a loyal People!</P>
<P>GREAT al&s;o are our Obligations to our wi&s;e and valo|rous <HI>General,</HI> who, from a di&s;intere&s;ted Love to his Coun|try, laid by his own private Affairs, left his honorable Seat at Court, and, what is more, his beloved Relatives and Friends, under all Advantages to be happy in the enjoy|ment of them, to go at the <HI>head</HI> of our Forces into the Enemies Land, and be&s;iege their &s;tronge&s;t Fortifications in this part of the World, expo&s;ing him&s;elf to known Difficulties and Hard&s;hips, and hazarding his Life, to make Acqui&s;itions for the public Safety. Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord his Strength, who taught his Hands to War, and his Fin|gers to fight; who hath been his Fortre&s;s and Deliverer; who hath pro&s;pered his Coun&s;els and Arms, to the &s;ubduing the People under him, and leading him into the <HI>&s;trong City,</HI> and putting him in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of its &s;trong Holds. May the great JEHOVAH be &s;till his Shield and Defence, and return him in Safety to his own Land, that he may here &s;peak of the mighty Acts of the Lord, and receive the ju&s;t Applau&s;es of his People!</P>
<P>WE &s;hould likewi&s;e be ungrateful, if we did not take a thankful Notice of our brave <HI>Commodore,</HI> to who&s;e Pru|dence, and Vigilance, and active Courage, under God, it was owing, that the Siege was covered. Relief for the Ene|my cut off, and a &s;trong Ship of War taken, which might otherwi&s;e have obliged our Forces to return with Di&s;|appointment and Damage. His readine&s;s, had there been a Nece&s;&s;ity for it, to have gone into the Harbour with his Ships, to join the Army in one general dreadful Attack upon the Town, ought always to be rememembred to his Honour: Nor will it be denied, that the Terror of &s;o many Ships, under the Command of &s;o brave an Officer, had a powerful Influence in the Surrender of the Place.
<PB N="11" REF="005558_0009_1018682FE1B41510">
Upon the&s;e Accounts the Name of <HI>Warren</HI> will, I tru&s;t, be ever treated with Re&s;pect in NEW-ENGLAND.</P>
<P>NEITHER &s;hould we forget to make an honourable Mention of the other <HI>Officers,</HI> yea, and of the <HI>Soldiers,</HI> who, in order to reduce the City of <HI>Loui&s;bourg,</HI> endured Hard|&s;hips, cheerfully went thro' Fatigues and Hazards, fearing nothing, and doing every thing Man could do!</P>
<P>AND &s;hall we not love and honor the&s;e brave In&s;tru|ments in the Shame that has been bro't upon tho&s;e who hated us, and the Salvation God has wrought out for this his People? We &s;hall be ba&s;ely ungraceful, if we withold from them their ju&s;t Prai&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT our Acknowledgments mu&s;t not be confined to <HI>Men,</HI> nor <HI>principally</HI> made to <HI>them</HI>; but to the <HI>God of Armies,</HI> the God who&s;e <HI>right Hand and holy Arm hath gotten us the Victory.</HI> Not unto us, O Lord, not unto any Skill, or Valor, or Strength of our Army or Fleet, but to thy Name be the Glory.&mdash;But I mu&s;t not anticipate what will more properly come in afterwards. I therefore go on to the next Thing propo&s;ed, which was,</P>
<P N="2">II. To take Notice of the <HI>marvellous Things</HI> which God &s;ometimes does in getting the Victory for a People. Says <HI>David</HI> in the Text, <HI>Marvellous Things hath he done: His right Hand and holy Arm hath gotten him the Victory.</HI> The meaning is, that it was in a <HI>marvellous</HI> Way, by &s;urpri&s;ing Events, that God gained this Victory for <HI>I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>NOR was this the only In&s;tance in this Kind. God often appeared <HI>wonderfully</HI> for that People, and made bare <HI>his holy Arm</HI> for the De&s;truction of tho&s;e who ro&s;e up again&s;t them. Sometimes he <HI>miraculou&s;ly</HI> exerted his Al|mighty Power, and did Things not only <HI>above,</HI> but <HI>con|trary</HI> to the Cour&s;e of Nature, and all humane Contrivance, to give them the Advantage of their Enemies. Thus, he rebuked the Red-Sea, and it was dried up: He led his <HI>I&s;rael</HI> thro' the Depth as thro' the Wilderne&s;s; while the Waters &s;wallowed up the <HI>Egyptians.</HI> The Walls of <HI>Jericho</HI> marvellou&s;ly fell down at the Sound of <HI>Rams-Horns</HI>; and the <HI>Lamps</HI> and <HI>Pitchers</HI> of <HI>Gideon</HI>'s three hundred Men
<PB N="12" REF="005558_0010_1018683331446570">
&s;truck the va&s;t Army of the <HI>Midianites</HI> with Con&s;ternati|on, &s;o that they madly turned every Man his Sword a|gain&s;t his Fellow. The Sun &s;tood &s;till to favour <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> in the pur&s;uit of his Enemies, while <HI>Hail-Stones</HI> from Hea|ven killed more than the Sword of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> And an <HI>An|gel</HI> was di&s;patch'd from the <HI>Armies above</HI> to rai&s;e the Siege at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> by de&s;troying an hundred and eighty five thou&s;and of the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> Army in one Night, which ob|liged the re&s;t immediately to retire from the Walls of that City.</P>
<P>BUT, in the <HI>ordinary</HI> Cour&s;e of Providence, God &s;ome|times does <HI>marvellous Things</HI> in favour of a People, and in order to their getting the Victory: Either, by a &s;ecret and invi&s;ible Influence, di&s;po&s;ing and ranging &s;econd Cau&s;es in &s;uch a Manner as to operate beyond all humane Expec|tation; or by interpo&s;ing &s;uch a Coincidence of Events, as could not have been fore&s;een, and when bro't to pa&s;s, draw the Attention of wi&s;e Ob&s;ervers, and force from them an Acknowledgment, that God's Throne is in the Heavens, and his Kingdom ruleth over all.</P>
<P>AND of this we have had an illu&s;trious In&s;tance, in the memorable <HI>Conque&s;t</HI> that has brought us together this Day.</P>
<P>I &s;carce know of a Conque&s;t, &s;ince the Days of <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> and the <HI>Judges,</HI> wherein the Finger of God is more vi&s;ible. There has been &s;uch a Train of Providences, &s;uch a Con|currence of favourable Circum&s;tances, making Way for it, as are truly wonderful; and, if con&s;idered in one collective View, render it proper to take up the Language of the Text, and &s;ay, <HI>Marvellous Things hath God done for us: His right Hand, and his holy Arm hath gotten us this Victory.</HI></P>
<P>IT may &s;eem &s;trange, that &s;uch a Country as this, &s;o weak in Strength, &s;o un&s;killed in the U&s;e of military Wea|pons, &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for want of Money, &s;hould make an Attempt upon &s;o &s;trong and fenced a City as <HI>Loui&s;bourg,</HI> at <HI>Cape-Breton</HI>: Nor &s;hould we have entertained the Tho't, if it had not been clearly pointed out to us by the <HI>Pro|vidence of God.</HI> It was apparently <HI>Providence</HI> that gave
<PB N="13" REF="005558_0011_10186838A64180B8">
Ri&s;e to this important De&s;ign; partly, by permitting the <HI>French,</HI> la&s;t Year, to take <HI>Can&s;o,</HI> and invade <HI>Annapolis,</HI> and form a Scheme to invade it again this Year; hereby open|ing to our View, in the cleare&s;t Manner, not only the <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> but <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of reducing this Place, from whence we were expo&s;ed to &s;uffer &s;o much, both on our <HI>Sea coa&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>Frontier-borders</HI>: Partly, by &s;ending a Number of rich <HI>Ea&s;t-India Ships</HI> into the Harbour of <HI>Loui&s;bourg,</HI> for the &s;upply and manning of which, in their Voyage to <HI>France,</HI> &s;o many of their Men, and &s;uch Quantities of their Stores, were taken off, and &s;o late in the Fall, as to render the Spring the <HI>Nick of Time</HI> (as we vulgarly &s;peak) the mo&s;t favourable Opportunity we might ever expect, for an En|terpri&s;e of this Nature: Tho' after all, it would probably have never been undertaken, if the Providence of God, notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t prudent Steps, under good Ad|vantages, to gain Intelligence, had not kept us &s;trangely in Ignorance, both as to the va&s;t Strengh of the Place, an Number of Inhabitants that might &s;uddenly be call'd in to its A&s;&s;i&s;tance. Many of our <HI>Officers</HI> and <HI>Soldiers,</HI> who now know the&s;e Things, have frequently declared, had they known them before, they &s;hould never have gone upon this Affair.</P>
<P>AND as it was by the Direction of Providence, we were led to form an Enterpri&s;e of &s;uch va&s;t Moment; to the &s;ame Cau&s;e mu&s;t it be a&s;cribed, that &s;o many Things were remarkably ordered all along in favour of it, and &s;o as finally to bring it to an happy I&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>IT was apparently owing to a &s;ignal interpo&s;ition in Providence, that &s;o many Per&s;ons, from all Parts of the Land, were &s;pirited to offer them&s;elves willingly for this Service; and that, within two Months from the Re&s;oluti|on of the Government to undertake this De&s;ign, the whole military Force was in readine&s;s for Embarkation, and un|der Sail for the Place they were intended to go again&s;t. I believe, I may &s;ay, &s;uch an Armament for an infant Pro|vince, &s;o voluntarily rai&s;ed, &s;o well fitted for their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;o &s;peedily di&s;patched away, can't be parallel'd in

Hi&s;tory: E&s;pecially, if we take into Con&s;ideration, toge|ther with our Inexperience in Affairs of this Nature, the con&s;iderable naval Force equipped; the great Number of Tran&s;ports provided; the va&s;t Quantity of Stores procured, both for the Support of our own Men, and the Annoyance of the Enemy: And as to many of the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary Stores, &s;uch as <HI>Cannon-Shot, Shells</HI> of various Sizes, <HI>Mortars, Co|horns, Hand-Granadoes, Scaling-Ladders, Field pieces, com|mon Carriages</HI> for many of our Cannon, and <HI>&s;pecial ones</HI> accommodated for the Tran&s;portation of tho&s;e Cannon that were to be u&s;ed in Battery; I &s;ay, as to the&s;e Stores, they were not only to be bought, but to be <HI>made</HI>: And yet, to the Surpri&s;e of every Body, the whole Work of Preparation, which was took in hand, after the Determi|nation of the Court, <HI>Jan.</HI> 29th, was compleated by <HI>March</HI> 21&s;t. when the <HI>General</HI> gave his Signal for &s;ailing.</P>
<P>I may, not improperly, remark here to the Honour of this <HI>Province,</HI> that the Men, &s;o &s;uddenly and &s;trangely got together to go upon this Expedition, were of a different Character from tho&s;e, who are commonly &s;ent upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions. They were not the Scum of the Land, idle worthle&s;s Creatures, given to Prophanene&s;s, Intemperance, and univer&s;ally debauched in their Manners. A Number of &s;uch there might be: But for the <HI>generality,</HI> they were Men who had upon their Minds an Awe of God, and feared an Oath; they were Men indu&s;trious in their Cal|lings, and well able to provide for them&s;elves and Fami|lies; in a Word, they were Men of Life and Spirit, ani|mated with love to their <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Country,</HI> and willing to venture their Lives, not &s;o much to <HI>&s;erve them&s;elves,</HI> as to promote the <HI>publick Good.</HI> 'Tis a rare Thing for &s;o many Men, of &s;uch a Character, to be engaged in a military En|terprize: And I can't but think, there was a &s;pecial Hand of Providence in it.</P>
<P>IT was owing remarkably to the Government of Pro|vidence, that the <HI>Weather</HI> was &s;o ordered in Favour of this Enterprize. Perhaps, the olde&s;t Man living does not remember &s;o long a Cour&s;e of moderate fair Weather as
<PB N="15" REF="005558_0013_1018683D75DFB3C8">
we were ble&s;&s;ed with, while preparing for the Expedition. There was not the lo&s;s of a Day, either by <HI>Snow, Rain,</HI> or <HI>Cold</HI>; which is wonderful, in this Climate, at this Time of the Year. Some, who have pre&s;erved an Ac|count of the Weather for more than twenty Years back, have been &s;urpri&s;ed to behold the Difference between the Months of <HI>February</HI> and <HI>March,</HI> this Year, and the fore|going ones; <HI>This,</HI> a continued Cour&s;e of good Weather; <HI>tho&s;e,</HI> as continually intermix'd with Storms of <HI>Snow,</HI> or <HI>Rain,</HI> or <HI>&s;everity of Cold.</HI></P>
<P>AND the Weather was as remarkably favourable to our De&s;ign at <HI>Cape-Breton:</HI> For, as &s;ome have ob&s;erved in their <HI>Letters,</HI> there was &s;carce ever known, among the <HI>French,</HI> &s;uch a Run of good Weather, as while they were laying Siege to <HI>Loui&s;bourg:</HI> Whereas, the very Afternoon they entered the City, the Rain came on, filled their Trenches with Water, and continued for &s;uch a Number of Days, that they mu&s;t have gone thro' in&s;ufferable Diffi|culties, and been in danger of rai&s;ing the Siege. The <HI>French</HI> them&s;elves took Notice of this Di&s;po&s;ition of Providence, and &s;aid, <HI>it was vi&s;ible God fought for us.</HI></P>
<P>IT was ob&s;ervably owing to Providence, that our <HI>Sol|diers</HI> were pre&s;erved from the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> as &s;uch Numbers of them were in this Town, in order to embark, when that <HI>infectious</HI> Di&s;temper broke out among us, threatning a univer&s;al Spread. And, perhaps, the Time was never known, when &s;o many Per&s;ons, in &s;o many different Parts of the Town, were taken ill with this Sickne&s;s, and it was notwith&s;tanding &s;topped in its Progre&s;s: Which is the more worthy of &s;pecial Notice, becau&s;e, if it had prevailed, it would unavoidably have put an End to the intended Ex|pedition.</P>
<P>IT was owing to the wonderful Conduct of a kind Pro|vidence, that &s;o con&s;iderable a military Force, at &s;uch a Sea&s;on of the Year, &s;hould be carried in Safety to the Place they were bound for, without the lo&s;s of a Man, or meeting with the lea&s;t Di&s;a&s;ter; and that their De&s;ign &s;hould be a <HI>perfect Secret</HI> to the Enemy, till they were
<PB N="16" REF="005558_0014_1018684049408F90">
&s;urpri&s;ed with the Sight of our Fleet, going into <HI>Chap|pereauge Bay.</HI> It was this that made way for landing our Men and Stores without Annoyance, unle&s;s from a &s;mall Party of the <HI>French,</HI> &s;ome of whom were taken, &s;ome killed, and the re&s;t obliged to flee for their Lives.</P>
<P>IT was owing to the extraordinary favour of Providence, that the Enemy, &s;o &s;oon after our landing, for&s;ook their <HI>Grand-Battery</HI>; allowing us to enter and take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it without the lea&s;t Oppo&s;ition. This &s;eems, on the one Hand, to have been a mo&s;t fatal Mi&s;take to <HI>them,</HI> which can &s;carce be accounted for, unle&s;s from a <HI>Spirit of Infa|tuation,</HI> or a <HI>mighty Terror &s;eizing their Hearts</HI>: And, on the other, the leading Advantage put into <HI>our</HI> Hands; as it animated our Men with Life and Vigor, furni&s;hed them with the <HI>heavie&s;t Cannon</HI> made u&s;e of in the Siege, and enabled them with greater Speed, and le&s;s Danger, to make their Attempt on the Town.</P>
<P>AND here was a Series of Things remarkably over|rul'd in Providence.</P>
<P>Not only were our Men di&s;po&s;ed and enabled to tran&s;|port their Cannon (&s;ome of which were of large Size and Weight) over Hills, and Rocks, and thro' Mora&s;&s;es, in which &s;ometimes they &s;unk with their Carriages &s;o as to be buried in the Mire; but, in &s;ight of the Enemy, and within reach of their Shot, they erected Batteries, mounted Guns, fixed Mortars, and &s;oon got all Things in readine&s;s, both to <HI>cannonade</HI> and <HI>bombard</HI> the Town: And all without the Lo&s;s of &s;carce a Man. And tho' they were nine and forty Days be&s;ieging the City, and had their neare&s;t advanced Battery within le&s;s than <HI>Thirty Rods</HI> of its <HI>We&s;tern Gate,</HI> (as the Mea&s;ure has &s;ince been taken) and were playing from it mo&s;t of the Time, and receiving the Enemies Fire; yet the Men &s;lain were but an hand|ful.</P>
<P>AND the like &s;ignal Pre&s;ervation they met with at their <HI>Battery</HI> by the <HI>Light Hou&s;e.</HI> This was the greate&s;t An|noyance to the Enemy, and, under God, the greate&s;t Cau&s;e of their Surrender. And the whole Time they were
<PB N="17" REF="005558_0015_10186843940E27C0">
erecting it, and getting their heavy Cannon up the high and &s;teep Rocks, to the Amazement of the Enemy, they were continually played upon both by their Cannon and Bombs: And yet, if I remember right, there was no more than one Man &s;lain. The whole Number indeed of Men lo&s;t, whether by the Sword, or Sickne&s;s, or Di&s;a&s;ter, du|ring the Siege, did not amount to more than an hundred and Twenty. This is <HI>the Doing of the Lord,</HI> and ought to be <HI>marvellous in our Eyes.</HI> The like has &s;carce been known in the World.</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ides the&s;e Favours of Providence, there was a mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable Coincidence of Events, all tending to point our View to God, and to lead us into an apprehen&s;ion of him as remarkably appearing to grant us Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>SUCH was the coming in of a large Supply of tho&s;e very Provi&s;ions which were wanted, ju&s;t as our Forces were ready to &s;ail, and without which they mu&s;t have been delayed.</P>
<P>SUCH was the taking a Number of <HI>Store Ships</HI> going to the relief of the Enemy, as well as intercepting a <HI>Pac|ket</HI> from <HI>France</HI> to the Governour of <HI>Cape-Breton,</HI> which might have contain'd Advices of great Importance to the <HI>French,</HI> and Di&s;&s;ervice to <HI>us.</HI></P>
<P>AND &s;uch al&s;o was the taking a large Ship of War, with more than five hundred Men, Provi&s;ions for eight Months, and about an hundred Barrels of Powder more than her own proper Store. Had the Providence of God permitted her to go in Safely, it might have defeated our De&s;ign. Such a Number of Men and &s;uch a Quantity of Provi&s;ion and Ammunition, would have given Heart as well as Strength to the Enemy, and, &s;ome think, mu&s;t have obliged us to rai&s;e the Siege. But what a merciful Turn did her Capture give to our Affairs? Not only were the Enemy weaken'd and di&s;pirited, but a great part of their Strength put into our Hands to be turn'd again&s;t them; be&s;ides that our <HI>Army</HI> received a Supply of Powder, which was now &s;o wanted, that our Canno mu&s;t have been &s;ilent without it.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="005558_0016_10186846DA3C2BD8">AND this Event is the more worthy of Notice, becau&s;e of the Incidents in Providence remarkably leading to it. A <HI>Packet boat</HI> from <HI>Great Britain</HI> arrives to Commodore <HI>Warren,</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> ordering him to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> with &s;everal Ships of War, to advi&s;e with Governour <HI>Shirley</HI> for the Protection of the <HI>Northern Colonies</HI>; which is the more ob&s;ervable, as the <HI>Commodore,</HI> thro' the Ignorance of his Pilot, had ju&s;t before lo&s;t his own 60 Gun-Ship, by Means whereof he could give our <HI>Governour,</HI> who had di&s;|patched Letters to him, advi&s;ing him of the De&s;ign again&s;t <HI>Cape-Breton,</HI> no great Encouragement to expect his Help; tho' being now acquainted with the Re&s;olution of this Government, he was prepar'd and di&s;pos'd to ha&s;ten away with the greater Speed, upon his Orders from <HI>Home.</HI> But had he come to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> as he intended, agreable to his Orders, he had probably been too late at <HI>Cape-Breton</HI> to have met with <HI>this Ship of War.</HI> A Ve&s;&s;el therefore is ac|cidently ca&s;t in his Way at Sea, accidentally to Man, but <HI>intentionally</HI> by God, giving him certain Information, that the <HI>New-England</HI> Forces had been &s;ome time on their Voyage; upon which, tho' in want of Water and Provi|&s;ions, he altered his Cour&s;e, and arrived before the Harbour of <HI>Loui&s;bourg,</HI> time enough to take the <HI>Vigilant,</HI> a fine new 64 Gun Ship, de&s;ignedly &s;ent from <HI>France</HI> for the Protec|tion of the <HI>French,</HI> and Di&s;tre&s;s of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing Article in the Conduct of Providence, was its di&s;po&s;ing the Enemy, by &s;urrendering their City and Fortre&s;&s;es, to prevent that general A&s;&s;ault, both by Sea and Land, which had been re&s;olved upon, and mu&s;t have occa&s;ioned a mo&s;t dreadful Effu&s;ion of Blood on both Sides: And God only knows, what the Event would have been; as the <HI>French</HI> were &s;o &s;trongly fortified, and had within their Walls 600 regular Troops, and, at lea&s;t, 1400 of the Inhabitants, whom they had valled in to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, the Reduction of <HI>Loui&s;bourg,</HI> con&s;i|dering the immen&s;e Sums of Money that have been laid out, by the King of <HI>France,</HI> to render it impregnable;
<PB N="19" REF="005558_0017_1018684A15F50090">
and con&s;idering al&s;o that it was accompli&s;hed by inexperi|enced undi&s;ciplined Troops from <HI>New-England,</HI> is an Event truly &s;urpri&s;ing, and will be &s;poken of as &s;uch at <HI>home,</HI> and handed down as &s;uch to the Children yet unborn.</P>
<P>WE may &s;ay, upon a review of the Providences obvi|ou&s;ly leading to undertake this Affair, and vi&s;ibly favour|ing it when undertaken, and all along remarkably concur|ring to its being delivered up into our Hands, <HI>Marvel|lous Things ha&s;t thou done for us, O Lord; thy right Hand and holy Arm have gotten us this Victory.</HI> And to thy Name be the Glory; which leads to the la&s;t Thing pro|po&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. To &s;how what Rea&s;on a People, for whom God has thus <HI>marvellou&s;ly</HI> gotten the Victory, have to <HI>&s;ing unto him a new Song</HI> of Prai&s;e. <HI>David,</HI> you &s;ee, calls upon the People of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to <HI>&s;ing unto the Lord a new Song,</HI> for the <HI>Victory his holy Arm had gotten</HI> for them. This gave them new Matter for a <HI>new Song,</HI> and ju&s;t Occa&s;ion to &s;ing it unto God.</P>
<P>AND the &s;ame may be &s;aid of us the People of God in this Land. He has given us a <HI>new</HI> and great Occa&s;ion to &s;ing Prai&s;e to his Name; and we &s;hall be horribly un|grateful, if we neglect to do &s;o. And the Ingratitude will ri&s;e in its Ba&s;ene&s;s, and Malignity, in proportion to the <HI>marvellous Things,</HI> which <HI>the right Hand and holy Arm</HI> of God hath done in getting for us &s;uch a glorious Conque&s;t; a Conque&s;t, putting us in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what may be called, <HI>the Key of North America</HI>; and which, if wi&s;ely improved, may be of va&s;t Service, not only to this and all the neigh|bouring Governments, but to <HI>Great Britain</HI> al&s;o, by guar|ding our Navigation, and &s;ecuring to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> the <HI>Cod-Fi&s;hery,</HI> the value of which will be great, at pre&s;ent, and may, in Time, go beyond Account.</P>
<P>'Tis ob&s;ervable, it was a common thing for God's Peo|ple of old, when &s;ucceeded again&s;t their Enemies, to cele|brate the Prai&s;es of that God who appeared for them, and gave them Victory. We have many Songs of Prai&s;e upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions in the &s;acred Writings. Such was the
<PB N="20" REF="005558_0018_1018684C060722F8">
Song of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> for the Victory of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> over the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> recorded in the 15th Chapter of <HI>Exodus.</HI> Such was the Song of <HI>Deborah</HI> and <HI>Barak</HI> for their intire Conque&s;t of <HI>Jabin</HI> and <HI>Si&s;era,</HI> as we may &s;ee in the 5th Chapter of <HI>Judges.</HI> And &s;uch al&s;o were &s;everal of the Songs of <HI>David,</HI> for God's powerfully delivering him out of the Hands of his Enemies, as they are to be met with in the Book of <HI>P&s;alms.</HI> All which In&s;tances of religiou&s;ly acknowledging God, upon Occa&s;ion of Victories obtain'd, were written for our Example, and call upon us, under the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances of Providence, <HI>to enter into God's Gates with thank&s;giving, and into his Courts with prai&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>AND as this is the De&s;ign of this Day's Solemnity, let us unite in <HI>prai&s;ing the Lord for the avenging of I&s;rael.</HI> Let us <HI>&s;ing Prai&s;es to the Lord God of I&s;rael.</HI> Let the in|&s;pired Language of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and the <HI>whole Body of the Jewi&s;h Nation,</HI> be our's upon this memorable Occa&s;ion, <HI>I will &s;ing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriou&s;ly.&mdash;The Lord is my Strength and Song, and he is become my Salvati|on: He is my God, and I will prepare him a Habitation; my Father's God, and I will exalt him.&mdash;The Lord is a Man of War, the Lord is his Name.&mdash;Thy right Hand, O Lord, is become glorious in Power.&mdash;Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the Gods? Who is like unto thee, glorious in Holine&s;s, fearful in Prai&s;es, doing Wonders? Thou ha&s;t &s;tretched out thy right Hand;&mdash;Thou, in thy Mercy, ha&s;t led forth the People which thou ha&s;t redeemed;&mdash;thou ha&s;t guided them in thy Strength</HI>&mdash;.</P>
<P>LET us recount the many Favours of God to our Bre|thren; the many wonderful Interpo&s;itions of Providence, making way for the glorious Conque&s;t they have gained: And let us mu&s;e on the&s;e Things, till our Hearts are war|med, and our Tongues opened to &s;hew forth the Divine Prai&s;es. Let us <HI>extol our God and King, and ble&s;s his Name forever and over.</HI> Let us <HI>&s;peak of the glorious Honor of his Maje&s;ty, and of his wondrous Works. Let us &s;peak of the might of his terrible Acts, and declare his Greatne&s;s. Let us abundantly utter the Memory of his great Goodne&s;s, and &s;ing of his Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="005558_0019_10186850F47467E0">AND let not the ble&s;&s;ed God have Occa&s;ion to &s;ay of us, as of his People of old, <HI>They &s;ang his Prai&s;e, they &s;oon for|gat his Works. They forgat God their Saviour, which had done great Things in</HI> Egypt, <HI>wondrous Works in the Land of</HI> Ham, <HI>and terrible Things by the</HI> Red-Sea.</P>
<P>LET us not think it enough, my <HI>Brethren,</HI> that we have laid a&s;ide our wordly Bu&s;ine&s;s, for a while, to appear in the <HI>Sanctuary</HI> of God, that we may &s;peak and &s;ing his Prai&s;es. The Lord hath <HI>done great things</HI> for us. The <HI>God of</HI> Je&s;hurun <HI>hath rode upon the Heavens in our help, and in his Excellency on the Skie.</HI> And this wonderful Ap|pearance of God for us, &s;hould excite our Love, warm our Devotion, confirm our Faith, encourage our Hope, and in&s;pire us with the firme&s;t Re&s;olutions of all holy Obedi|ence to the Commandments of God.</P>
<P>LET us not think, that God will be plea&s;ed with meer external Offerings of Prai&s;e. <HI>Nay, he hath &s;hewed thee, O Man, what is good. And what doth the Lord thy God re|quire of thee, but to do Ju&s;tice, and to love Mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? Behold, to obey is better than Sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of Rams. To love the Lord our God with all our Heart, and with all our Under|&s;tanding, and with all our Soul, and with all our Strength, and to love our Neighbour as our&s;elves, is more than whole Burnt-offerings and Sacrifices.</HI> Let us, together with <HI>Offer|ings of Prai&s;e, order our Conver&s;ation aright:</HI> So &s;hall we <HI>glorify God,</HI> and he will &s;till <HI>&s;hew us his Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>AND let me here mind you of one Way wherein 'tis peculiarly fitting you &s;hould expre&s;s your Gratitude on this joyful Occa&s;ion; and that is, <HI>by &s;hewing Mercy to the Poor.</HI> 'Tis ob&s;ervable, when the <HI>Jews</HI> pre|vailed again&s;t their Enemies, and &s;olemnized the <HI>Fea&s;t of Purim</HI> in Thank&s;giving to God, they <HI>gave Gifts to the Poor,</HI> as we read, <HI>E&s;ther</HI> 9.22. And if, when we fa&s;t, and humble our &s;elves before God, 'tis proper <HI>to deal our Bread to the hungry, when we &s;ee the naked to cover them, and &s;atisfy the afflicted Soul</HI>; is it not rea&s;onable al&s;o when we are called to <HI>&s;erve the Lord with gladne&s;s, and to come before his Pre|&s;ence with &s;inging,</HI> to be in the exerci&s;e of that <HI>Charity</HI> which &s;hall re|fre&s;h the Bowels of the poor and needy? Can there be a more fit Occa&s;ion than a Day of religious Gladne&s;s and Thank&s;giving, to open our Hands in liberal Di&s;tributions, cau&s;ing the Widow's Heart to &s;ing
<PB N="22" REF="005558_0020_10186852D1883090">
for Joy? Let us in this way, <HI>do good, for with &s;uch Sacrifices God is well plea&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>BUT what I would more e&s;pecially recommend to you is, the exer|ci&s;e of all Chri&s;tian Compa&s;&s;ion towards tho&s;e of the <HI>Enemies</HI> whom it has plea&s;ed God to put under our Power. <HI>Of old it was &s;aid, thou &s;halt love thy Neighbour, and hate thine Enemy</HI>; but our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;ays, <HI>love your Enemies.</HI> This <HI>Chri&s;tian Law</HI> mu&s;t not indeed <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;trued in prejudice of that Love which we owe to our &s;elves, our Families and Country, which may make it nece&s;&s;ary to take up Arms: But when by this Means our Enemies are fallen into our Hands, we &s;hould treat them, not only with Humanity, but Chri&s;tian Love; be|ing ready to all the Offices of Kindne&s;s and Compa&s;&s;ion towards them. We &s;hould not in&s;ult them, we &s;hould not upbraid them, we &s;hould not treat them with Har&s;hne&s;s and Severity; but endeavour to make their captive State as comfortable to them as may con&s;i&s;t with the publick Good.</P>
<P>SOME of you, it may be, have Friends or Relatives among their Ene|mies. How would you de&s;ire they &s;hould treat them? Would not you be glad, if they were kind to them? Would you not think hardly of them, if they &s;hould &s;hut up their Bowels of Compa&s;&s;ion, and be|have towards them with Diskindne&s;s? Let us treat tho&s;e who are our Captives in the &s;ame humane chri&s;tian Way, we &s;hould be glad our Friends &s;hould be treated, or our &s;elves, were we in our Enemies Pow|er. That is the Pre&s;cription of the Bible, <HI>Prov.</HI> 25.21. <HI>If thine Enemy be hungry, give him Bread to eat; and if he be thir&s;ty, give him Water to drink.</HI> And the Rea&s;on follows in the next Ver&s;e, <HI>For thou &s;halt heap Coals of Fire upon his Head, and the Lord &s;hall reward thee.</HI>&mdash; But I have no need to u&s;e any Arguments upon this Head. I believe there is no Place where Pri&s;oners of War are treated with more Kind|ne&s;s. They have no Rea&s;on to complain for want of all rea&s;onable Liberty, or that they are not &s;utably provided with all Things nece&s;&s;a|ry: Tho' the Ca&s;e of &s;ome of them may be &s;uch as to call for Chri&s;tian Charity; and in this Ca&s;e, I would hope, there are none of us but would willingly open our Hands for their Relief; and in &s;o doing we &s;hould honour God, and behave like the Di&s;ciples of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: Nor &s;hould we in any wi&s;e lo&s;e our Reward; it would be laid up for us in Heaven.</P>
<P>AND now as the Conclu&s;ion of all, May it plea&s;e the good and gra|cious God to over rule this glorious Conque&s;t to an happy I&s;&s;ue, the Good of our <HI>Nation</HI> and <HI>Land.</HI> May he give all needed Direction as to re&s;ettling the Place. And may all proper Care be taken, that the pure Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t be preached in this part of the Dominion of Antichri&s;t. May the Man of Sin, that Son of Perdition, be no longer acknowledged as Chri&s;t's Vicegerent. May all <HI>Graven Images</HI> be pul|led down, all <HI>Super&s;tition</HI> removed, and the Religion of our Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, as it is contained in the BIBLE, be upheld and practiced there.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="005558_0021_10186855FA848F70">AND may the happy Period come on, when Nation &s;hall no more life up Sword again&s;t Nation, nor the Alarm of War be heard on Earth. This happy Time can't be expected till the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t has taken to him&s;elf his great Power and Reign; till he is &s;eated <HI>King upon God's holy Hill of Zion,</HI> and has generally &s;ubdued the Lu&s;ts and Pa&s;&s;ions of Men: And when this is once the Ca&s;e, that will be fulfil|led which is &s;poken by the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah, The Wolf &s;hall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard &s;hall lie down with the Kid; and the Calf, and the young Lion, and the Fatling together, and a little Child &s;hall lead them. And the Cow and the Bear &s;hall feed, their young ones &s;hall lie down together.&mdash; They &s;hall not hurt nor de&s;troy in all my holy Mountain.</HI> The Meaning is, Love and Peace &s;hall reign on Earth among Men. The good Lord ha&s;ten this ble&s;&s;ed Time, for his Mer|cies &s;ake in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
