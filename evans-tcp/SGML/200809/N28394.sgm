<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM CXXXVII. 5. 6.</HI></BIBL>
<P>If I forget thee, O Jeru&s;alem, let my right hand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jeru|&s;alem above my chief joy.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE penman of this p&s;alm is un|known. He was, probably, &s;ome holy prophet, prie&s;t, or Levite, who penned it during his own and his brethren's captivity in Babylon. It has ever been ju&s;tly admired; and attempts have been made by &s;ome of the fir&s;t poets to render
<PB N="6" REF="037833_0004_100F821FF2C66DA8">
it into Engli&s;h ver&s;e. We regret that he who excelled all others in &s;acred poe&s;y, and who has given an admirable tran&s;|lation of this p&s;alm,
<Q>in its Jewi&s;h form," &s;hould have a&s;&s;erted, that it could not well be converted into Chri&s;|tianity;</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Watts's Mi&s;cellaneous Thoughts.</NOTE> and has, con&s;equently, omitted it in his &s;y&s;tem for divine wor|&s;hip. It appears to admit of an ea&s;y and u&s;eful application.</P>
<P>AS Jeru&s;alem was a type of the Chri&s;|tian church on earth, and of the general a&s;&s;embly of the fir&s;t-born on high, &s;o the captive &s;tate of the Jews, the &s;coffs which they endured from their enemies, the affectionate remembrance of their former privileges, and their pro&s;pects of a glo|rious re&s;toration, well repre&s;ent the af|flictions of the Church, and her final triumph; together with the exerci&s;es of the pious under the&s;e con&s;iderations. The words which have been read are beautifully and forcibly expre&s;&s;ive. To
<PB N="7" REF="037833_0005_100F8222E3DB3300">
manife&s;t the mo&s;t tender concern for the di&s;tre&s;s of Jeru&s;alem, and anxiety for her deliverance, the form of an imprecation is adopted.
<Q>If I forget thee, O Jeru|&s;alem, let my right hand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jeru&s;alem above my chief joy.</Q>
Rather than &s;tring their harps for the purpo&s;e of mirth, they wi&s;h that they might lo&s;e their &s;kill in playing; rather than cea&s;e to mourn their de&s;olate condition, and look forward to the return of pro&s;perity, they wi&s;h to be deprived of the u&s;e of their faculties.</P>
<P>THESE words teach us, my brethren, what ought to be our &s;entiment and con|duct with re&s;pect to the exten&s;ion of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; and they afford a pro|per &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e on this occa|&s;ion. They have been preferred, becau&s;e Chri&s;tians appear more to need excite|ment than information as to their duty. There is not one of us who does not
<PB N="8" REF="037833_0006_100F822487EF3830">
believe that a time will come when the Chri&s;tian religion will prevail over the whole earth, and that we are under obli|gation to promote this; but we are too &s;eldom aware of the means in our power, and too di&s;inclined to u&s;e them. In one word, while we a&s;&s;ent to the nece&s;&s;ity and benefit of mi&s;&s;ions, they are either not undertaken, or not &s;upported, for want of a mi&s;&s;ionary &s;pirit.</P>
<P>THE de&s;ign then is, &s;imply, to de&s;cribe the temper and practice of tho&s;e who can &s;incerely &s;peak the language of the text.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, The enlargement of the Church is to &s;uch, an object of their highe&s;t de&s;ire.
<Q>If I prefer not Jeru&s;a|lem above my chief joy.</Q>
To this, riches, honors, and plea&s;ures yield in e&s;|timation, and with the greate&s;t rea&s;on. The glory of God, and the welfare of mankind are the leading principles which govern the Chri&s;tian's heart; and the&s;e are advanced in proportion to the &s;ucce&s;s
<PB N="9" REF="037833_0007_100F8227CE4A7E38">
of the go&s;pel. Every &s;entiment of grati|tude, and every benevolent feeling unite in diffu&s;ing the knowledge of the love of God to our lo&s;t world.</P>
<P>THIS contributes to the temporal hap|pine&s;s of men, by enlightening their minds, &s;ubduing their evil pa&s;&s;ions, and directing them in the di&s;charge of the du|ties which they owe to the great Author of all, and to one another. That &s;o much mi&s;ery is found on this earth ari&s;es from the partial and imperfect prevalence of the Chri&s;tian religion. Even where it is profe&s;&s;ed, it is either mi&s;under&s;tood, or corrupted, or the power of it is not felt. Its real tendency is to produce righteou&s;|ne&s;s and peace; and we are a&s;&s;ured that this will be the effect when the nations generally embrace it; that
<Q>nation &s;hall not lift up &s;word again&s;t nation, nei|ther &s;hall they learn war any more.</Q></P>

and &s;ecure; when &s;he is tranquil at home, and commands re&s;pect abroad; he &s;ees in the revolutions of empires only the workings of human pa&s;&s;ions, and he fondly anticipates a time when civil rights being well under&s;tood, and free govern|ments e&s;tabli&s;hed, a melioration &s;hall take place. But he who prefers Jeru&s;alem above his chief joy, calls
<Q>that people happy who&s;e God is the Lord;</Q>
he views every revolution as connected with and &s;ub&s;ervient to Me&s;&s;iah's reign, and that on this ultimately depends the hap|pine&s;s of the great family of mankind. The fault lies in the innate corruption of our nature. That only which can and will effectually regenerate the world is the religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT when we con&s;ider that the re|demption of Chri&s;t is the way which God hath provided for the recovery of fallen men to holine&s;s and happine&s;s; that without the knowledge of this they mu&s;t &s;uffer endle&s;s mi&s;ery in a future &s;tate,

<Q>If I forget thee, O Je|ru&s;alem.</Q>

<P><PB N="12" REF="037833_0010_100F8230E5517B68">Is he, my brethren, e&s;teemed a bene|factor of mankind who breaks the yoke of tyrants, and &s;ecures to a people civil freedom? Much more ought he who de|livers them from the captivity of &s;in and &s;atan. Is he entitled to reward who in|troduces the arts of civilization? Much more is he who teaches the heavenly art of living to God, and prepares citizens for the New Jeru&s;alem. Is he the friend of the poor and mi&s;erable who vi&s;its, and cheers by his bounty, their gloomy abodes? Much more is he who directs the laboring con&s;cience where to find peace, and points to life and immortality through the Saviour. The progre&s;s of the go&s;pel is an object of the highe&s;t importance to the temporal and eternal welfare of our race, and it is an object of the highe&s;t de&s;ire to all who feel the &s;pirit of the text.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, Such will encou|rage and &s;trengthen one another in this glorious work. While they are not un|apprehen&s;ive

of the difficulties which they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily encounter, they will not be di&s;po&s;ed to magnify the&s;e, and to dwell upon them &s;o as to di&s;courage them&s;elves and others. Every enterpri&s;e is attended with difficulties. The Chri&s;|tian has nothing to do with the&s;e, when the path of duty is evident, but to fore|&s;ee and prepare to meet them; leaving the event to God who doeth according to his will, and before whom the mountains often become a plain.</P>
<P>IT has been &s;aid, by way of di&s;courag|ing the attempt to &s;end the go&s;pel to the Heathen, that now is not the time which God hath fixed for their conver&s;ion. Whence has this information been ob|tained? Who has relea&s;ed Chri&s;tians from the obligation to make con&s;tant and unwearied exertions? Are not the means and the end connected? And when the former are faithfully u&s;ed, have we not rea&s;on to believe that the latter will fol|low? Yea, when the proper methods are
<PB N="14" REF="037833_0012_100F823908E83E30">
vigorou&s;ly pur&s;ued, may it not be &s;aid, that the time is come?</P>
<P>IT has been objected that it is in vain to &s;end the go&s;pel to a people, until they are civilized? But how are they to be civilized? Will not the per&s;on who teaches them the things which belong to their everla&s;ting peace, teach them al&s;o the arts of civilization, and inculcate the duties of &s;obriety and indu&s;try? Will their meeting together for divine wor|&s;hip, and the in&s;truction of their children have no effect? Will not the&s;e gradually check their roving di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;often their ferocious nature? So far from wait|ing until a &s;tate of civilization precede the preaching of the go&s;pel, that the&s;e mu&s;t go together; or rather, the recep|tion of the Chri&s;tian religion will natu|rally produce the other.</P>
<P>AGAIN, It has been objected that mul|titudes on the frontiers, and even in the interior places of our country, are de&s;ti|tute
<PB N="15" REF="037833_0013_100F823A9891B028">
of religious in&s;truction; and that the&s;e fir&s;t demand our attention. It can|not be ju&s;tly &s;aid that they are &s;o de&s;titute as the &s;avages in the wilderne&s;s. Many of them once lived under the go&s;pel; and they either have, or might have now the means of &s;alvation. The holy &s;criptures, which te&s;tify of Chri&s;t, are acce&s;&s;ible to them. Be&s;ides mi&s;&s;ionaries are &s;ent among them by mo&s;t of the Chri&s;tian denomi|nations. Granting their condition to be pitiable, is not the condition of others more to be deplored? Should we not fly to &s;ave tho&s;e fir&s;t who are in the greate&s;t danger of de&s;truction? Who have the be&s;t claim to our benevolence? Tho&s;e who are deprived of every way of relief, or tho&s;e who will not u&s;e it when in their reach?</P>
<P>IT has been farther &s;tarted as a diffi|culty that proper mi&s;&s;ionaries cannot be procured. Such per&s;ons &s;eem to forget that "the Lord of the harve&s;t" hath
<PB N="16" REF="037833_0014_100F823D71B86C90">
promi&s;ed, and
<Q>that he will &s;end forth labourers into his harve&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>THESE objections will not deter tho&s;e who are intent on the work. They are an&s;wered by referring to the grace of the Redeemer, and by an appeal to repeated experience. Had the Apo&s;tles been af|frighted by dangers of this &s;ort, they had never gone forth into all the world. Had Paul con&s;ulted with fle&s;h and blood, he had not been
<Q>debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians;</Q>
he had never preached the go&s;pel
<Q>from Jeru&s;alem and round about unto Illyricum.</Q>

<P>THE in&s;titution of &s;uch &s;ocieties as of late years have taken place, embracing the different denominations, has a happy tendency to encourage, to animate, and to give efficacy to their efforts. The in|fluence of a &s;ingle man is often great; the influence of a number &s;triving to|gether for the &s;ame cau&s;e is &s;till greater,
<PB N="18" REF="037833_0016_100F8246B5902C68">
and renders &s;ucce&s;s almo&s;t certain. The expre&s;&s;ion u&s;ed in the addre&s;s of one of the Mi&s;&s;ionary Societies in Britain,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edinburgh.</NOTE> con|veys a noble and affecting idea;

<P>HOW con&s;olatory to Chri&s;tians to know that though &s;ome of them may be depri|ved of other means of affording a&s;&s;i&s;tance, yet they can all help by their prayers! And what encouragement to Mi&s;&s;ionaries &s;truggling with difficulties, that they have acce&s;s to Him who heareth prayer, and are a&s;&s;ured that they are continually remembered by the faithful in every part of the world!</P>
<P>BESIDES the &s;ecret addre&s;&s;es to God, tho&s;e who are truly engaged for the pro|motion of the Redeemer's kingdom, will meet together, and unite in their &s;uppli|cations. To this exerci&s;e a ble&s;&s;ing is promi&s;ed. Hear the words of our Lord!

cannot be &s;tretched forth? Is it not be|cau&s;e they forget Jeru&s;alem, and &s;et her pro&s;perity below their chief joy? Infidels may &s;neer, and carnal profe&s;&s;ors &s;tart alarmed as though they feared to be robbed of their gods, but let them know that accur&s;ed is every thing which is not &s;ub&s;ervient to the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t; and that who&s;oever &s;acrilegiou&s;ly withholds from God, his money &s;hall peri&s;h with him, the ru&s;t of it &s;hall witne&s;s again&s;t him, and &s;hall eat his fle&s;h as it were fire.</P>
<P>BUT there is no nece&s;&s;ity for &s;uch de|mands upon Chri&s;tians as would deprive them of a &s;ingle convenience or even comfort in life. There is an abundance for the work, of what the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors can|not po&s;&s;ibly enjoy; yea, of what is a burden to them, and may be a real inju|ry to their po&s;terity. None will under|&s;tand me as inveighing again&s;t indu&s;try and enterpri&s;e in the concerns of this world, or again&s;t a liberal provi&s;ion for our hou&s;eholds. Suffer me, however, to

&s;ay, and to a&s;k every one in this a&s;&s;em|bly to mark it, that the honor and ad|vantage of wealth lie &s;ingly in its proper u&s;e. It makes eminent when it is made the in&s;trument of eminent good.</P>
<P>WHEN God requires our &s;ouls, who&s;e &s;hall tho&s;e things be which we have pro|vided?

Had&s;t thou remembered Jeru&s;alem, and preferred her above thy chief joy, thou would&s;t have had a place there; but now thou art &s;hut out, and thy &s;hort-lived joys are followed by endle&s;s torments!</P>
<P>ADMITTING that the rich worldling &s;hould &s;till withhold his gifts, there is no occa&s;ion for de&s;pair. All who are im|pre&s;&s;ed with the importance of the de&s;ign will contribute time after time, accord|ing to their ability; and God will gra|ciou&s;ly

that the Directors employed, during the winter, an additional per&s;on as a catechi&s;t, and who is al&s;o a mechanic; and that both the&s;e per&s;ons with their wives and twelve children began their journey, in the &s;tate of Vermont, on the 13th day of la&s;t month, and are now on their way to the Chicka&s;aw country.

<P>HAVING thus effected a permanent re|&s;idence for per&s;ons who carry with them the joyful found of the go&s;pel, and the arts of civilized life, we believe that tem|poral and eternal ble&s;&s;ings are about to be extended to the&s;e poor heathen.

<HEAD>REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS.</HEAD>
<P>IN their report of November 14th, 1799, the Di|rectors &s;tated, in general, the arrival of the Mi&s;|&s;ionary, the Rev. Jo&s;eph Bullen, among the Chicka|&s;aw Indians, and their favourable di&s;po&s;itions towards him, although he had not been formally acknowledg|ed by the nation. They have it now in their power to communicate to the Society, the very plea&s;ing in|telligence, that his reception has been friendly and flattering even beyond expectation. The Indians appear to have vied with each other in their kind|ne&s;&s;es to him, and his &s;on who accompanied him; and to have li&s;tened with re&s;pect and reverence to his religious in&s;tructions. It will readily occur that during Mr. Bullen's &s;hort re&s;idence in the Indian country, viz. from the 20th May till the 4th of September 1799, no great progre&s;s in the work of his mi&s;&s;ion could rea&s;onably be expected. The diffe|rence
<PB N="35" REF="037833_0033_100F8279A5C8B6D8">
of language and of manners, the impo&s;&s;ibility of procuring proper interpreters, and the difficulty of procuring any worthy of confidence; the &s;tate of In|dian &s;ociety, and the jealou&s;y of the Indian temper, are ob&s;tacles which time, patience, and per&s;everance are nece&s;&s;ary to remove. Yet, under all the&s;e di&s;cou|ragements, added to the affliction of broken health, and the &s;evere &s;ickne&s;s of his &s;on, Mr. Bullen ap|pears to have laboured with fidelity, and not with|out effect. One of the Chicka&s;aw chiefs has been prevailed upon to &s;et up the wor&s;hip of God in his family: Others are cheerful in promoting the intro|duction of the go&s;pel into the nation; and the ne|groes, of whom it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es con&s;iderable numbers, have di&s;covered much anxiety to learn the things which belong to their peace. Several of them came miles to hear Mr. Bullen preach and catechi&s;e, and &s;ome of them &s;eemed &s;o to embrace the word of life, that he thought him&s;elf warranted to admini&s;ter bap|ti&s;m to one family, viz. a father and four children.</P>
<P>The Indian diet and mode of living in general di&s;agreeing with his con&s;titution, &s;o as gradually to impair his health and &s;trength &s;o far as to incapaci|tate him for the comfortable di&s;charge of mi&s;&s;ionary duties, and his &s;on having been brought, by di&s;ea&s;e, to the brink of the grave, Mr. Bullen thought it re|qui&s;ite to leave the country for a while and return home. He took his departure accordingly on the 4th of September, with the regrets of the chiefs and nation. He was e&s;corted a con&s;iderable di&s;tance on
<PB N="36" REF="037833_0034_100F827BDB6F25C8">
his journey, and parted with them after receiving their earne&s;t &s;olicitations to come back as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible. Two addre&s;&s;es to the board of Directors, one from Wolf's friend, the head man of the nation, and another from General William Colbert and Ma|jor George Colbert, both chiefs of influence, officially reque&s;ted that Mr. Bullen might return without de|lay, and bring his family to &s;ettle among them They al&s;o reque&s;ted that the board would &s;end &s;ome other per&s;ons who could teach them &s;ome of the arts of civilized life, and promi&s;ed lands during their continuance in the country, and &s;uch other &s;uccours as it &s;hould be in their power to give.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this application, the Directors thought it their duty, and of high importance to the objects of this Society, to attempt the formation of a &s;mall religious &s;ettlement in the Chicka&s;aw country. For this purpo&s;e they have connected in the mi&s;&s;ion with Mr. Bullen and his family, Deacon Ebenezer Rice and his family. With Mr. Rice, both from re&s;pectable information, and per&s;onal interview, they have every rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied, as a man of evan|gelical principles and experimental godline&s;s, and one well qualified to a&s;&s;i&s;t Mr. Bullen as a catechi&s;t. Be|&s;ides his u&s;efulne&s;s in catechi&s;ing, Mr. Rice, from his mechanical &s;kill, will be able to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Indians in the con&s;truction of hou&s;es, mills and looms. From his family and that of Mr. Bullen's jointly, they will learn agriculture and &s;everal of the dome&s;tic arts. While the females will be of eminent &s;ervice in in|&s;tructing
<PB N="37" REF="037833_0035_100F827F24F76100">
the Indian women. A number of per&s;ons of other occupations were willing to accompany the million. But the Directors, having adopted, as a fundamental principle, the re&s;olution of not employ|ing any who &s;hould not be primarily devoted to the propagation of the glorious go&s;pel, and with whom improvements, merely civil, &s;hould not be a &s;econdary object, and having nothing to convince them that the applicants are of this de&s;cription, were obliged to de|cline the offer.</P>
<P>Mr. Bullen, therefore, and Mr. Rice, with their families, agreed to go, by them&s;elves, on the noble and generous enterpri&s;e. They &s;et off on the 13th in&s;tant, and are now pro&s;ecuting their journey.</P>
<P>The number of per&s;ons belonging to the Mi&s;&s;ion is as follows:

<P><PB N="38" REF="037833_0036_100F82822EA0C480">They have al&s;o authorized Mr. Bullen to employ as a teacher under him for one year, a per&s;on of piety and &s;oundne&s;s in the faith, and have voted a compen&s;ation of 100 dollars.</P>
