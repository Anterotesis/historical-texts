<BIBL>PROV. XXII. Ver. 6.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Train up a Child in the Way he &s;hould go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BLindne&s;s and Ignorance in Things of the highe&s;t Moment for us to know, is one of the greate&s;t Mi&s;eries that can po&s;&s;ibly happen to the Soul in this Life; for as Souls are de&s;ign'd to live happy or mi&s;erable for ever, which Happine&s;s depends upon the right U&s;e of their Liberty; and that upon their Knowledge how to u&s;e and determine it; it will be impo&s;&s;ible for them to attain eternal Happine&s;s, or e&s;cape e|ternal Mi&s;ery, without Knowledge to &s;teer, or direct them right.</P>
<P>From hence appears the great Importance of train|ing up Children in the Ways of Vertue, that &s;o early Cu&s;tom may reconcile them to their Duty: And it is &s;o much the more indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e the Seducer is always at Hand to lead them a&s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="004478_0004_100D538CA4E36BA0">
My Bu&s;ine&s;s therefore &s;hall be, to enforce the good Work of training up Children in the Way they &s;hould go, for the important Rea&s;on intimated in my Text, that, <HI>when they are old, they may not de|part from it.</HI></P>
<P>And &s;hall then make an Application &s;uitable to the Occa&s;ion of our pre&s;ent &s;orrowful Meeting.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I am to enforce the good Work of training up Children in the Way they &s;hould go, for the im|portant Rea&s;on intimated in my Text, that, <HI>when they are old, they may not depart from it.</HI></P>
<P>I would not here be under&s;tood to &s;ugge&s;t, that this general Rule admitted of no Exception; there have been, and will be again, In&s;tances to the con|trary: But &s;uch In&s;tances are very uncommon; and it rarely happens, that &s;uch Per&s;ons totally and fi|nally mi&s;carry.</P>
<P>It is a great Advantage to Religion to have been &s;ea&s;onably planted in the tender Soil, and to have taken the fir&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: And Education has the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, tho' not the only Share in our Tempers and Manners.&mdash;Children are very early capable of ill Impre&s;&s;ions, and what is imbibed in Youth, is more la&s;ting &amp; influential.&mdash;The human Mind is as prone to bring forth Error and Vanity, as the Earth is to bring forth Thorns and Thi&s;tles; for by Nature we are Children of Wrath, and by the earlie&s;t Practice Children of Di&s;obedience. The I|maginations and Thoughts of our Hearts, from our Youth up, are only Evil continually. It is a <HI>lively</HI> tho' <HI>dreadful</HI> Picture, which St. <HI>Paul</HI> gives of our natural State, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. <HI>Ch.</HI> 16. 17 <HI>v</HI> That De&s;tructi|on and Mi&s;ery are in our Ways, and the Ways of Peace we have not known. Yet the&s;e very Souls thus vitiated by Sin, are capable of being re&s;tored
<PB N="7" REF="004478_0005_100D53AF05333510">
and &s;anctified, and of being prepared to &s;erve God graciou&s;ly in this World, and to enjoy him in Glory in the World to come.</P>
<P>Shall &s;uch Souls then as the&s;e be thrown away? Are they to be let alone? Are no Means to be u&s;ed to enlighten them, to turn them, and to deli|ver them from their Folly &amp; Mi&s;ery? The dread|ful Con&s;equences of &s;uch a Neglect, are worth our Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>As has been already ob&s;erved, we are naturally inclined to Evil; the neglect therefore of Education lays Children under a kind of Nece&s;&s;ity of pur&s;uing what they are by Nature inclined to; Sin and Vice become &s;oon habitual to them; and when once the&s;e are grown familiar, there &s;eems to be an End of Liberty and Choice; they are then for the mo&s;t Part deaf to good Coun&s;el and In&s;truction: or if they are di&s;po&s;ed to hear, they want the Power to follow it, being bound in the Chains of their Sins, and led Captive by Satan, at his Plea&s;ure. And when they are reduced to this Condition, their Ruin &s;eems to be &s;eal'd, and without a Miracle of God's Grace, are never to be reclaim'd. It fares with our Minds, as it does with our Bodies; They are &s;upple and pliable in their fir&s;t and early Years, ea&s;ily bow'd and turned this way or that: but they grow fix'd and &s;tiffen'd as they ripen into Age, then pre&s;erving the &s;ame Shape, Figure and Frame into which they had been fir&s;t moulded. The very Di&s;|po&s;ition and Turn of Mind depends much upon it: and perhaps a great deal of what we call <HI>natural Temper,</HI> is little more than that particular Frame of Heart, which was fir&s;t infu&s;ed in our Education. This &s;hews the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;owing the Seeds of Re|ligion early in &s;o tender a Soil, and the evil Con&s;e|quence of &s;uch a neglect.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="004478_0006_100D538E2BA293F8">
How invaluable a Ble&s;&s;ing then is it, to have been &s;et right at fir&s;t? How ea&s;ily, I had almo&s;t &s;aid in&s;en&s;ibly, may &s;uch arrive at the greate&s;t Heights? They run thro' the Difficulties of a religious Cour&s;e, without &s;o much as feeling the Pain and Toil of it. Happy they who have been thus conducted through the Paths of Virtue! Who have never known what it is to have been captivated to Sin and Satan, never felt the weight of prevailing Lu&s;ts, corrupt Cu&s;toms, or vicious Habits. How ea&s;ily may they obtain a Crown? which mu&s;t co&s;t others dear, and be hardly gain'd, (if gain'd at all) after many doubtful Strug|gles, many Sighs and Tears, many bitter Pains and Agonies of Mind.</P>
<P>To be then a Parent is &s;urely a Concern of great Weight and Moment, every Child being a con&s;ide|rable Charge intru&s;ted with &s;uch by God: And al|tho' Parents are not expre&s;ly named, yet are they nece&s;&s;arily implied and &s;uppo&s;ed in the <HI>Text,</HI> for all Acts mu&s;t have their Agents, as well as their Ob|jects. But what is hinted <HI>proverbally</HI> in my <HI>Text;</HI> is <HI>el&s;ewhere</HI> more <HI>expre&s;ly declared,</HI> Deut. 6. Ch. 6. v. 7. <HI>Thou &s;halt teach them diligently unto thy Children, and thou &s;halt talk of them when thou &s;itte&s;t in thy Hou&s;e, and when thou walke&s;t by the Way, when thou lie&s;t down, and when thou ri&s;e&s;t up.</HI> Nor is the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> in this particular le&s;s pre&s;&s;ing than the <HI>Law. Fathers provoke not your Children to Wrath, but bring them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord,</HI> Eph. 6. Ch. 4. ver. (i. e.) In a literal Sen&s;e, bring them up in the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion;</HI> teach them their Duty, what they are to believe and practice; in&s;truct them in the Knowledge of <HI>God,</HI> and of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; &s;hew them in what Condition they are by <HI>Nature;</HI> and to what they are advanced by <HI>Grace;</HI> let them know, that without believing in Chri&s;t, they can

reap no Benefit from his meritorious Undertakings; that without Holine&s;s there can be no Happine&s;s; and that therefore they mu&s;t be careful to keep a good Con&s;cience towards God and Man, and by a blamele&s;s Conver&s;ation to adorn the Doctrine of the Go&s;pel. Above all, inform and endeavour to con|vince them, that there is a Life after Death, where|in Men &s;hall receive from God, a mighty and eter|nal Reward, or a terrible and endle&s;s Puni&s;hment, according as they have done, or neglected their Duty in this Life; and therefore urge it upon them as an undeniable Truth, that if they live unholy Lives, they &s;hall die mi&s;erably; and that tho' their Lives be never &s;o long and pro&s;perous, yet if they die in their Sins, it would be better, far better for them they had never been born.</P>
<P>And as it is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Parents, to in&s;till into their Children's Minds the Principles of Religion; &s;o &s;hould it be their Care, to frame their Lives ac|cording to the Rules and Precepts of it: to train them up in the exerci&s;e of Obedience, and Mode&s;ty, of Diligence and Sincerity, of Tenderne&s;s and Hu|manity, as the general Di&s;po&s;itions to Religion; to accu&s;tom them to the government of their Pa&s;&s;ions and Tongues, as the Foundation of it; and to inure them to the Practice of Piety &amp; Devotion towards God; of Sobriety and Cha&s;tity with regard to them&s;elves, and of Ju&s;tice and Charity towards all Men, as the principal Parts of it.</P>
<P>By conducting them&s;elves in this manner, Parents no le&s;s con&s;ult their own Good, than that of their Children; for by this faithful di&s;charge of their Duty, they &s;ecure to them&s;elves &s;ome of the prime Ble&s;&s;ings both for this World and the other; hav|ing &s;ecured the refre&s;hing Te&s;timony of a well di&s;|charged
<PB N="10" REF="004478_0008_100D5390EBBD6B10">
charged Con&s;cience, &s;o as to wa&s;h their Hands in innocency from the Guilt of &s;haring in their Chil|dren's Sins, and Ruin, &s;hould they mi&s;carry; and taking the mo&s;t effectual Cour&s;e of enjoying the un&s;peakable Ble&s;&s;ing of good and dutiful Children while they live here; and of lying down at la&s;t in their Graves, with the tran&s;porting Hopes of meet|ing them all again with endle&s;s Joys in Glory here|after. Neither finally, will the <HI>Publick</HI> be le&s;s here|by obliged: &s;ince Families are both Nur&s;uries for <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State,</HI> on the Management whereof their Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery doth wholly depend; &s;o that Men can in no other Way de&s;erve better of Man|kind, or become greater Benefactors to the World, than by training up their Children in the Principles of Vertue and Goodne&s;s.&mdash;Which is the Rea&s;on, why in <HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>Athens,</HI> and <HI>Sparta,</HI> and other well order'd Governments, a more e&s;pecial Care was taken about the training up of Youth.&mdash;Without this, Men would grow wild and &s;avage, unfit for Socie|ty. Rebellions, Rapines, Murders, and other mon|&s;trous Impieties, are but the natural Fruits of deprav|ed Nature, uncultivated by Education. But if Youth be wi&s;ely &amp; ju&s;tly managed, how happy will its In|fluence be upon Society, and what Ble&s;&s;ings will it draw down from Heaven upon Men.&mdash;And Oh! happy the Children that have &s;uch Parents? And happy the Parents that thus take care of their Children?</P>
<P>But becau&s;e Providence brings Children into ma|ny other Dependencies and Relations in the World, and by various Ways cuts them off from the imme|diate Care of their Parents; as by the Parents Death, or Di&s;tance from them, or by their Inabi|litity or Unwillingne&s;s to in&s;truct them; it is there|fore incumbent on others, whether Ma&s;ters or Go|vernours,
<PB N="11" REF="004478_0009_100D53B2172FB6F8">
who have the Care of them, to provide In&s;truction for their Minds, as well as Food and Cloathing for their Bodies.&mdash;<HI>Abraham</HI> as the Head of the Family, has this honourable Te&s;timonial from God him&s;elf; <HI>I know him, that he will command his Children, and his Hou&s;hold after him, and they &s;hall keep the Way of the Lord,</HI> Gen. 18. Ch. 19. ver.&mdash;<HI>Jo&s;hua, Mo&s;es's</HI> Servant and Succe&s;&s;or &s;aid, <HI>As for me, and my Hou&s;e, we will &s;erve the Lord,</HI> Jo&s;h 24 Ch. 15. ver. The general Precepts of loving our Neigh|bour as our Selves, &amp; of doing to others as we would they &s;hould do unto us, makes it nece&s;&s;ary for all tho&s;e who have the Care of Children, to train them up in the Way they &s;hould go.&mdash;And let this be a fur|ther Motive towards promoting the Di&s;charge of this Duty of In&s;truction, that the neglect of it will not only involve tho&s;e concerned, in the Inconve|niencies, Shame, and Sorrow of Children's Mi&s;car|riages, but in a great Mea&s;ure in the Guilt of them. For certain it is, that Parents mu&s;t be one Day ac|countable for all their Neglects of their Children, in Matter of In&s;truction, Example, and Re&s;traint from Evil.&mdash;And let me intreat all Ma&s;ters of Families to be e&s;pecially careful in the Particular of &s;etting good Example; for there is &s;mall probability of Succe&s;s, where there is a con&s;tant Contradiction be|tween the In&s;tructor's Precepts and his Practice. The Force of a Pre&s;ident (as <HI>Experience</HI> convinces us) is va&s;tly more prevalent, than that of Precept. And even Children will be more apt to follow a bad Example, than the be&s;t In&s;tructions: Vain therefore will your Cautions again&s;t tho&s;e Things be, which you practice your &s;elves; vain will your Puni&s;hments be for the commi&s;&s;ion of them; when all your Arguments may be baffled with this &s;ingle Que&s;tion, <HI>Thou that teache&s;t another, teache&s;t thou not thy&s;elf? How then will it make your Ears tingle,
<PB N="12" REF="004478_0010_100D53927415BD80">
when God &s;hall ari&s;e terribly to Judgment, and &s;ay to you, Behold! the Children which I have given you; they were Ignorant, and you in&s;tructed them not; they made them&s;elves Vile, and you re&s;trained them not. Why did you not teach them at Home, and bring them to Church, to the publick Ordinances, and Wor&s;hip of God, and train them up to the Exerci&s;e of Piety and Devotion? But you did not only neglect to give them good In&s;truction, but you gave them bad Example: And lo! they have followed you to Hell, to be an addition to your Torment there.</HI></P>
<P>Would not &s;uch a Charge as this make every Joint of you to tremble, would it not cut your Hearts, would it not &s;trike you with Horror, to be thus reproached? I am not able to make &s;o dread|ful a Repre&s;entation of this Matter, as it de&s;erves, but I would awaken Parents to a Sen&s;e of their Duty, and terrify them out of this gro&s;s &amp; &s;hame|ful neglect, which too many are guilty of.</P>
<P>Let Parents then carefully admini&s;ter, and Chil|dren patiently and gladly receive In&s;truction, their future Intere&s;t depends upon it. And what is the Life of the Body compared with the Life of the Soul, or the Plea&s;ures of Time compared with eternal Torments? And let me prevail on all, (who are not yet arrived to Years of maturity) to con&s;ider, that no Objections or Prejudices again&s;t a compliance, can be of equal Weight with the eternal Life or Death of your Souls. When Satan or Sinners, or your own Hearts would cau&s;e you to refu&s;e Chri&s;t, and neglect Salvation; have this An&s;wer to all their Pleas in readine&s;s; My Life or Death, my eternal Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery depend upon my re|ceiving or neglecting Chri&s;t; If I have not Chri&s;t, I can't have Life; If I have no Grace, I can ne|ver have Glory.</P>

Since then you have precious and immortal Souls to be &s;aved? Since you have Helps and Encou|ragements which many others want? Is it not bet|ter to be good and happy with a few, than to be wicked and mi&s;erable with a Multitude? Shall all the Care, Co&s;t and Kindne&s;s of your Friends be lo&s;t, and your Souls undone for ever? Can all the Plea&s;ures of Sin make amends for the Sorrows it will bring in the End; when you will be forced to mourn at the la&s;t, and to &s;ay, <HI>How have we hated In&s;truction, and our Hearts de&s;pi&s;ed Reproof, and have not obeyed the Voice of our Teachers, nor inclined our Ears to them that in&s;tructed us?</HI> But before it comes to this, may the Lord incline your Ears that you may hear, and your Souls may live! <HI>Take fa&s;t hold of In&s;truction, let her not go, keep her, for &s;he is thy Life.</HI></P>
<P>The Time will not permit me to pro&s;ecute this important Subject any further; I mu&s;t break off the Thread of my Di&s;cour&s;e, by intreating you to turn your Eyes to a mi&s;erable poor Creature, under the deepe&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s and Agony of Soul, from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a mi&s;pent Life, and the certainty of her very near approaching Execution; reduced to this deplorable Condition, chiefly from a want of tho&s;e Opportunities of In&s;truction, you &s;o plen|tifully enjoy: being heretofore in&s;tructed neither in the Doctrines of Faith, nor &s;ea&s;on'd with the Principles of pure Religion. This was the Scource of all her Misfortunes; an utter In&s;en&s;ibility or Ig|norance of the Ways of living u&s;efully in this World, or happily in another. May her untimely End in|fluence you all to lay fa&s;t hold on In&s;truction; may her Example and Sufferings an&s;wer the Intention of the Law, and deter all viciou&s;ly and wickedly di&s;|po&s;ed Per&s;ons among you from incurring the like Condemnation.</P>

She is to die for concealing the Death of her Ba&s;tard Child, &s;uppo&s;ed to be murdered by her; and if &s;o, the mo&s;t unnatural Murder! But this Part of the Charge &s;he denies, yet acknowleges her Sentence to be ju&s;t, in as much as &s;he neglected the nece&s;&s;ary Means of it's Pre&s;ervation.&mdash;Murder is a horrid Crime, and therefore puni&s;h'd by the Laws of mo&s;t Nations with Death, becau&s;e the Common-Wealth is deprived of an innocent Member, by one that is apparently pernicious.&mdash;But why &s;hould I at pre&s;ent upbraid or in&s;ult this poor Malefactor!

<P>My Bu&s;ine&s;s is to addre&s;s my dull Hearers, to rou&s;e them up to a Con&s;ideration of their own Ways, and (altho' their Con&s;ciences may acquit them of the Sin of Murder) to exhort them to inquire if there are not Sins of as damning a Nature, that they may be involved in.&mdash;What think you of Adultery, Fornication, Extortion? The&s;e triumph with great Security, are left unmortified and un&s;ubdued, in fa&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your Hearts, and in full &s;way there.&mdash;What think you of Malice, Envy, Slander, Detraction, Backbiting, Lying? The&s;e, my Bre|thren, are Sins of the Fle&s;h, and tho' not puni&s;hed with a Gallows here, are re&s;erved for God's eternal Judgment. St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells us, that <HI>they which do &s;uch Things, &s;hall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</HI> It is dreadful to behold a poor mi&s;erable Sinner, in perfect Health, taking her Leave of the World, and all the Vanities of it: The uncommonne&s;s of the Sight &s;trikes us with Horror, and &s;hocks our very Nature. But upon Reflection, how is her Ca&s;e more de&s;perate than that of a forlorn wretch|ed Sinner upon a Death-Bed? Nay the Advan|tage

Therefore by <HI>Faith look up unto Je&s;us, the great Propitiatory Sacri|fice, the Lamb of God, that taketh away the Sins of the World</HI>&mdash;Then adore the divine Goodne&s;s, that has with &s;uch infinite Mercy to us, given Him to be the Propitiation for our Sins; and earne&s;tly beg from the bottom of thy Heart God's Pardon for all thy Sins from thy Youth up, until now, (par|ticularly that for which thou art &s;hortly to &s;uffer) in his Name, and for his Sake; humbly be&s;eeching the God of all Grace and Goodne&s;s, that He who is in Chri&s;t reconciling the World unto him&s;elf, would for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, be reconciled to thee, and receive thee to his Mercy.</P>

Here is comfort for the &s;incere Penitent, (tho' mi&s;erable Sinner,) by the Stripes of Je&s;us he is healed, the Benefit of his Blood does not only reach the Righteous, and the Innocent; tho&s;e that through a good Education, and a virtuous Di&s;po&s;ition have, in a great Mea&s;ure, e&s;caped the Pollutions of the World, and have all their Lives long given up them&s;elves to the Service of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; I &s;ay, it is not to the&s;e only, that the Mercies of the Go&s;pel are extended; (tho' of all others the&s;e are the mo&s;t happy People&punc;) but the Gate is open, even to the prodigal Children; tho&s;e that have wa&s;ted all their Father's Sub&s;tance in Lewdne&s;s and riotous Living; even the&s;e the Father is ready to receive with open Arms, if they can have but the Heart to return to him. Many In&s;tances and Examples do the Scriptures of the Old Te&s;tament afford of tho&s;e that have found Mercy from God, after their falling into &s;inful and grievous Crimes; as <HI>David,</HI> after his commi&s;&s;ion of Murder and Adultery; <HI>Solomon,</HI> af|ter a Cour&s;e of Debauchery and Idolatry; <HI>Ma|na&s;&s;es,</HI> after a long Life of horrid Impieties.&mdash;And &s;ure the Gates of Repentance are as open in the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> as the <HI>Old,</HI> under the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> as under the <HI>Law.</HI></P>
<P>I will not take upon me to &s;ay, which were the greate&s;t Sins that ever were committed by Mankind; but I will In&s;tance in two, that mu&s;t needs be acknowledged to have been very great, which yet have obtain'd Pardon: and they are the Sin of our fir&s;t Parents, and the Sin of the <HI>Jews</HI> in crucifying our Saviour.&mdash;In the latter of the&s;e In&s;tances, be&s;ides the greatne&s;s of the Per|&s;on, again&s;t whom they &s;inned, (putting to Death the Lord of Life and Glory) there was de&s;ign'd

Malice, Perjury, Subornation, Contumely, In|gratitude, Contradiction to the plaine&s;t Evidence of Miracles of all Kinds, and to the Conviction of their own Con&s;ciences: And notwith&s;tanding St. <HI>Peter</HI> exhorts the &s;ame Men to Repentance.&mdash;And our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour him&s;elf apologizes for their Ignorance, <HI>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do:</HI> And <HI>the Scriptures bear them witne&s;s, that if they had known him, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.</HI> This Igno|rance is all the Extenuation the horror of their Crime was capable of.&mdash;And &s;ome Extenuation it always is, tho' in proportion le&s;s, as the Means of Knowledge are greater.&mdash;I would not here be under&s;tood to in&s;inuate the Pri&s;oner's Ignorance of the capitalne&s;s and wickedne&s;s of the Crime &s;he is convicted of; I only apply it to &s;ome of the Actions of her pa&s;t Life, for which &s;he mu&s;t account at the great Tribunal, as well as for this.</P>
<P>Further, altho' I can by no Means think the Ca&s;e of the Labourers coming into the Vineyard at the eleventh Hour, nor that of the <HI>Penitent Thief</HI> upon the Cro&s;s to be exactly parallel with the Ca&s;e of this condemn'd Malefactor; yet &s;ome Re&s;emblance may be di&s;covered; and the&s;e In|&s;tances may afford &s;ome Encouragement to her, who&s;e Misfortune it has been to live a long Time in Ignorance and Sin.&mdash;In the Thief upon the Cro&s;s we have an In&s;tance of a poor Wretch almo&s;t expiring; certain Death upon him, dying under publick Puni&s;hment for a very heinous Crime: And yet at the End of a Life, led pro|bably after the Rate that theirs generally are, who&s;e Wickedne&s;s at length brings them to an untimely End: This Creature is &s;oftned at once,

received into Favour, and promi&s;ed a tran&s;lation from a <HI>Gibbet</HI> into <HI>Paradi&s;e.</HI>&mdash;This certainly is a Monument of Mercy, a &s;tanding Comfort to all in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances who truly repent, tho' at their la&s;t Hour.&mdash;For even they who have lain long in the Snares of the Devil, and thro' the Cour&s;e of a whole Life, been taken Captive by him at his Will, &s;hall like this reclaimed <HI>Thief,</HI> be re&s;cued, accepted, rewarded; provided they like him return to God, and improve their ne|ver &s;o &s;mall remainder of Time to the be&s;t Ad|vantage.</P>
<P>And this we tru&s;t is pretty near the Ca&s;e of our poor condemned Si&s;ter; the Scales have fal|len from her Eyes, and Streams of Tears gu&s;h'd out, the bitter, but whol&s;ome Tears of Repen|tance:&mdash;The Sincerity of which, tho' none but God that &s;ees the Heart can certainly tell, yet Man al&s;o may, and ought to believe, not on|ly in the Judgment of Charity, but of moral Practice, from all evident Signs of it, which are to be given by one in her Condition.&mdash;And tho' to for&s;ake Sins then, when we can no longer en|joy them, &s;eems to be rather the Effect of Impo|tency and Nece&s;&s;ity, than of Choice, and there|fore not &s;o acceptable, or Prai&s;e-worthy; yet we find Almighty GOD often u&s;es the one to bring about the other; and improves a forced ab&s;tinence from Sin, into a &s;ettled loathing and dete&s;tation of it.&mdash;So that I think we may charitably conclude, that her Condemnation, thro' the Grace of God has proved an effectual Means of a true, tho' late Repentance: And that if &s;he has done all that po&s;&s;ibly &s;he could in that little Time that has been allow'd her; even this her Work &s;hall not

<P>Grant we be&s;eech thee therefore, O Heavenly Father, that &s;he may End her Life in thy Fear and Favour, and that &s;he may receive her Death, which is &s;o very near at Hand, not as a <HI>Cur&s;e,</HI> but as a <HI>Deliverance.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>And I intreat you all here pre&s;ent to join with me in commending her Soul into the Hands of Almighty GOD, as into the Hands of a faithful Creator, and mo&s;t merciful Saviour, humbly be|&s;eeching Him, that it may be precious in his Sight.</P>
<P>Lord, wa&s;h her Soul in thy Blood, that it may be pre&s;ented without Spot unto thee. And let her die in thy Favour, and re&s;t in Peace, and ri&s;e again in Glory.&mdash;Strengthen her O God! in her Agonies; as her Strength fails, let her Pains wear off. But when her Strength fails, let not her Faith fail; even in Death, let her Tru&s;t in thee. And the nearer &s;he is drawing to thee, the more do thou manife&s;t thy Mercy.&mdash;Lord Je&s;us have Mercy upon her! Thou Lamb of God that tak|e&s;t away the Sins of the World, be merciful to this poor Sinner; perfect her Repentance, and accept it; blot out all her Mi&s; Deeds, as thou engage&s;t to do to all who &s;incerely repent of the &s;ame. Deliver her O Lord, from fear of Death, and from all violent Di&s;orders of a troubled Fancy, or painful Delu&s;ions of her Gho&s;tly Enemy. Let not him now be able to di&s;turb or terrify her, or any way to prevail again&s;t her, but guard thou thy Servant.&mdash;Give thy Holy Angels charge to &s;tand about her, to guard and receive her poor
