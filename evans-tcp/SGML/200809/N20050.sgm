<P>WHEN GOD gave his law to the children of I&s;rael at mount Sinai, the &s;cene was truly terrible. He de&s;cended upon the mount in awful pomp and terrible maje&s;ty; with thunders, lightnings and a thick cloud, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; &s;o that all the people in the camp trembled, and mount Sinai was altogether on a &s;moke, becau&s;e the Lord de&s;cended upon it in fire&mdash;and the &s;moke thereof a&s;cended as the &s;moke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. This is the account Mo&s;es gave of this &s;olemn and terrible &s;cene, Exod. 19th. The people terrified at the &s;ight, reque&s;ted that Mo&s;es might be the mouth
<PB N="4" REF="026266_0003_0FD00640BB0056F0" MS="y">
of GOD to them for the future, to declare his will; and promi&s;e obedience, ver&s;e 27 of the context. Go thou near, and hear all that the Lord our GOD &s;hall &s;ay; and &s;peak thou unto us all that the Lord our GOD &s;hall &s;peak unto thee, and we will hear it and do it. GOD heard and approved of their propo&s;al, as is declared ver&s;e 28, I have heard the voice of the words of this people which they have &s;poken unto thee, they have well &s;aid all that they have &s;poken.</P>
<P>BUT he fore&s;aw the &s;aid propen&s;ity of his people to back&s;lide; and &s;eems to lament over them as a people who would revolt to their ruin. But in the text expre&s;&s;eth an ardent and pathetic wi&s;h, that they would be as good as their word, that they would hear and do all that GOD by Mo&s;es &s;hould enjoin upon them.&mdash;O that there were &s;uch an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments al|ways, that it might be well with them, and with their children forever.</P>
<P>FROM the text this truth is obvious&mdash;viz&mdash;That it is the will of GOD and plea&s;ing to him, that we earne&s;tly, diligently and con&s;tantly &s;eek happine&s;s, by a con&s;cientious conformity to his requirements. My de&s;ign in attending to this &s;ubject, is that I may endeavor to vindicate the divine character, again&s;t the a&s;per&s;ions of &s;uch as &s;ugge&s;t that notwith&s;tanding the provi&s;ion made for the &s;alvation of fallen man, GOD ne|ver

de&s;igned or de&s;ired the &s;alvation of many of them, that a few cho&s;en ones will at all events be &s;aved, and the re&s;t mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily peri&s;h; GOD has from eternity decreed their everla&s;t|ing de&s;truction, and there is no e&s;caping&mdash;that three fourths of the human race are the objects of this dreadful decree&mdash;that Chri&s;t died only for a few, viz. the elect, and they only can be &s;aved; and the re&s;idue mu&s;t remain objects of divine wrath&mdash;That every event that takes place is the con&s;equence of an ab&s;olute decree, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily come to pa&s;s, even all the wick|ed actions of wicked men, as well as the virtu|ous and religious actions of good men. What wor&s;e idea can we po&s;&s;ibly form of any being, than to &s;uppo&s;e an all-powerful creator, bring|ing into exi&s;tence millions of rational agents only to render them mi&s;erable; de&s;igning that they &s;hould be wicked, that he might have the plea&s;ure of terribly de&s;troying them. Let us my brethren never harbour &s;uch a thought of an infinitely wi&s;e, ju&s;t, merciful and good, as well as powerful GOD. That he does not, cannot de&s;ign his rational agents for &s;in and mi&s;ery, but for holine&s;s and happine&s;s, I tru&s;t will pre&s;ently be rendered evident.&mdash;That a great propor|tion of mankind will finally peri&s;h there is great rea&s;on to fear. That few comparatively attend to the great, the all-important bu&s;ine&s;s of reli|gion is a melancholy truth&mdash;but this is not be|cau&s;e there is not &s;ufficient provi&s;ion made for their &s;alvation&mdash;not becau&s;e Chri&s;t did not die

for them&mdash;not becau&s;e Heaven has decreed that they &s;hould be wicked per&s;ons, and live in the neglect of GOD and religion; but becau&s;e they will not comply with the divine propo&s;als.&mdash;Po&s;&s;ibly it may be objected, it is the decree of Heaven that men &s;hould act as they do, and it cannot be otherwi&s;e&mdash;It appears to me &s;hock|ingly bla&s;phemous thus to make a pure and holy GOD the author of &s;in, by &s;ugge&s;ting that he can require his creatures to per&s;ue <HI>&s;uch</HI> a mode of conduct, and yet by an ab&s;olute decree lay them under a fatal nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;obeying him, and then terribly puni&s;h them for &s;uch di&s;obedience&mdash;Shocking thought! That the people of GOD are a cho&s;en people, will not be di&s;puted&mdash;they are frequently called &s;o in &s;cripture&mdash;I &s;hall mention but one text out of many that might be quoted to this purpo&s;e, 1 Peter, ii, 9. But ye are a cho&s;en generation, a royal prie&s;thood, an holy nation, a peculiar people, that ye &s;hould &s;hew forth the prai&s;es of him who hath called you out of darkne&s;s into his marvellous light. The doctrine of election is often mentioned in &s;cripture, and therefore &s;hould be con&s;idered as a doctrine of chri&s;tia|nity: but the preci&s;e &s;en&s;e in which it is to be under&s;tood, has been always matter of doubt and di&s;pute among the greate&s;t and be&s;t men; and perhaps, the highe&s;t angel in heaven, does not fully comprehend the &s;ubject&mdash;On a matter &s;o nice and intricate, it &s;urely becomes &s;uch &s;hort-&s;ighted creatures as we are, to think and &s;eek
<PB N="7" REF="026266_0006_0FD006485F8CD3F8">
&s;peak mode&s;tly and with great caution&mdash;and ever cultivate great charity toward &s;uch as think differently from us, on a matter which none of us can decide&mdash;and whatever &s;cheme we adopt, &s;urely we &s;hould ever guard again&s;t one that &s;hall imply any imperfection in the great and glorious GOD&mdash;And there can be no dif|ficulty in concluding that that is wrong which repre&s;ents him as an hard ma&s;ter, an unju&s;t and cruel being, requiring impo&s;&s;ibilities of his crea|tures and puni&s;hing them eternally for not per|forming them&mdash;This is a character of him &s;o contrary to rea&s;on, and that given of him in the &s;acred writings; that we ought to reject that &s;cheme which implies it. It is rational to &s;up|po&s;e a perfect being, po&s;&s;e&s;t of every thing a|miable and excellent, every thing to render him lovely in the eyes of his rational agents; and in the mo&s;t endearing light do the &s;criptures ex|hibit the character of the glorious GOD; as an infinitely wi&s;e, holy, ju&s;t, good, kind, compa&s;|&s;ionate being&mdash;con&s;ulting the good of his ratio|nal creatures like a tender father; yea, with a compa&s;&s;ion infinitely greater than the mo&s;t ten|der earthly parents exerci&s;e toward their chil|dren.</P>
<P>THAT &s;cheme of divinity therefore which re|pre&s;ents this gloriou&s;ly compa&s;&s;ionate being, as rendering the ruin of his creatures nece&s;&s;ary cannot be of GOD, and ought to be rejected with abhorrence?</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="026266_0007_0FD00649C92B5DC8">THE doctrine of the decrees, I think &s;hould be numbered among tho&s;e things which the Apo&s;tle Peter mentions in his 2d Epi&s;tle 3 chap|ter at the 16th ver&s;e&mdash;as contained in Paul's E|pi&s;tles, hard to be under&s;tood, which they that are unlearned and un&s;table wre&s;t unto their own de&s;truction. Concerning things which are hard to be under&s;tood, it mu&s;t be improper to a&s;&s;ert dogmatically.</P>
<P>THE doctrine of Election has been &s;adly abu|&s;ed to the di&s;honor of GOD, and the great in|jury of mankind; rendering &s;ome &s;ecure and throwing others into great di&s;tre&s;s. When the man who has no reli&s;h for the great bu&s;ine&s;s of religion, is called upon to attend to the con|cerns of the &s;oul, to quiet his con&s;cience while he indulgeth him&s;elf in iniquity, he will object and &s;ay, it is doubtful whether I am elected or not; if I am elected I &s;hall certainly be &s;aved, I need not give my&s;elf any concern about the matter. If I am not elected, I &s;hall inevitably be damned; and it will be to no purpo&s;e, to make any attempt to obtain &s;alvation. This is a &s;ubtil wile of the Devil to keep men &s;ecure in his &s;ervice, and in this way they &s;ometimes rea|&s;on them&s;elves out of religion&mdash;becau&s;e they have no heart to engage in it. On the other hand, it is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e that tho&s;e who are earne&s;tly and diligently &s;eeking the face and fa|vor of GOD, are greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed through fear that they are not of the number of GOD's elect
<PB N="9" REF="026266_0008_0FD0064B4DED79B8">
&mdash;and therefore &s;hall finally peri&s;h. Thus Sa|tan worries tho&s;e whom he cannot de&s;troy.</P>
<P>THE man who lives a life of rebellion again&s;t GOD has certainly no claim to happine&s;s; no rea&s;on to look upon him&s;elf one of GOD's cho|&s;en ones&mdash;but he who lives like a chri&s;tian, a life of faith and obedience to our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, has no rea&s;on to fear that he &s;hall mi&s;s of &s;alvation. We need not worry our&s;elves a|bout election if we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the character and temper of chri&s;tians, he that is holy will be happy. Let me ob&s;erve farther, rea&s;on and religion dictate that GOD governs the world agreeable to &s;ome wi&s;e and good plan; and it is equally evident that he has made us rational agents. Our bu&s;ine&s;s is, not to inquire into the &s;ecret coun&s;els of heaven; but to labour to know and do the revealed will of heaven; in this way &s;hall we make our calling and election &s;ure, this is what is plea&s;ing to GOD, and this is the way to &s;ecure our own eternal happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS is the truth &s;ugge&s;ted in the text, and which I &s;hall endeavor to e&s;tabli&s;h you in the belief of, viz. that it is the will of GOD and plea&s;ing to him that his rational creatures dili|gently and con&s;tantly &s;eek happine&s;s by a com|pliance with his propo&s;als. GOD has made us capable of happine&s;s; has given us &s;trong de|&s;ires after it. Tho&s;e de&s;ires are therefore law|ful: and he has amply provided for &s;atisfying them.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="026266_0009_0FD0064D332B9C00">IF it be inquired on what terms we may be happy, I an&s;wer, by a con&s;cientious compliance with the go&s;pel, by faith in and obedience to the dear redeemer, this is what GOD requires of all who enjoy go&s;pel light and privileges&mdash;this he has made the condition on which we may and &s;urely &s;hall be happy&mdash;and it certainly is his will and plea&s;ing to him that we &s;eek and &s;erve him in this way. The words of the text if du|ly attended to mu&s;t put the matter out of di&s;|pute&mdash;<Q>O that there were &s;uch an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep my com|mandments always; that it might be well with them, and with their children forever.</Q></P>
<P>ARE the&s;e the words of him who by a fatal decree has made the wickedne&s;s and ruin of mankind nece&s;&s;ary? Would he as it were la|ment that his people would be mi&s;erable through their own folly; and expre&s;s an ardent wi&s;h that they would do as they had &s;aid; would be in all things obedient, that it might be well with them? Tho&s;e words were &s;poken by the great GOD him&s;elf, who mu&s;t mean as he &s;aid&mdash;It would be bla&s;phemous to doubt of his &s;incerity.</P>
<P>HE is a GOD who cannot lie, and is under no po&s;&s;ible temptation to &s;ay one thing while he means another. Therefore when he expre&s;&s;eth his wi&s;h that his people would be virtuous and religious, that they might be happy; there can be no rea&s;onable doubt that it is his &s;incere de|&s;ire
<PB N="11" REF="026266_0010_0FD0064E3B994F18" MS="y">
fire that they comply with his will; that they may &s;ecure to them&s;elves the ble&s;&s;ings of this life, and that to come. And it mu&s;t be impu|dent, wicked and bla&s;phemous to &s;ugge&s;t that he has by a decree rendered it nece&s;&s;ary for them to pur&s;ue a contrary mode of conduct.</P>
<P>THAT GOD wills the happine&s;s of his ration|al agents is probable by a great variety of argu|ments.&mdash;This may be argued,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. FROM the goodne&s;s and benevolence of his nature. He is the fountain of goodne&s;s&mdash;goodne&s;s in the ab&s;tract. We have all po&s;&s;ible e|vidence that GOD is good, not only from the character he has given of him&s;elf; but from daily and hourly experience, it is his glory that he is unboundedly good. When Mo&s;es put up this petition, I be&s;eech thee &s;hew me thy glory. The Lord an&s;wered, I will cau&s;e all my good|ne&s;s to pa&s;s before thee; and proclaimed his name the Lord, the Lord GOD merciful and gracious, forgiving iniquity, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and &s;in, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> We are all witne&s;&s;es for GOD, that he is good. He di&s;pen&s;eth his &s;avors liberally and promi&s;euou&s;ly to the wicked and prophane as well as to the virtuous and holy; cau&s;eth his fun to ri&s;e and &s;hine on the evil and on the good. And &s;endeth rain on the unju&s;t as well as on the ju&s;t. Surely this infinitely good being who is kind to the evil and unthankful, cannot will the mi&s;eries of his creatures without great and ju&s;t cau&s;e; it is contrary to his nature to be cruel or unkind.
<PB N="12" REF="026266_0011_0FD0065870824620">
Therefore he never can by a decree render the wickedne&s;s and mi&s;ery of mankind nece&s;&s;ary&mdash; but his goodne&s;s mu&s;t incline and di&s;po&s;e him to promote the pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of his rational agents in all proper ways. Therefore it is plea&s;ing to him when we take a proper care of our&s;elves by pur&s;uing the road leading to hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2d. THIS is evident becau&s;e his glory is in a &s;en&s;e connected with the happine&s;s of his intel|ligent creatures&mdash;we do him the greate&s;t honor, when we pur&s;ue &s;uch a mode of conduct as tends mo&s;t to our comfort and felicity. It is a &s;elf-|evident truth, that GOD made man to honor and &s;erve him; and this qualifies him for hap|pine&s;s in the enjoyment of him; is he not plea&s;|ed when men make it their care to an&s;wer the end for which he gave them being? Is it po&s;&s;i|ble but he &s;hould be di&s;plea&s;ed when they do what in them lies, to fru&s;trate his de&s;igns?</P>
<P N="3">3d. SUCH a mode of conduct as infinite wi&s;|dom dictates as honorary to GOD and happy for man is infinitely wi&s;e and good in it&s;elf, the law of GOD is holy, and the commandment ho|ly, and ju&s;t and good, a con&s;ciencious conformi|ty to it therefore as it is happy for man, &s;o it mu&s;t be plea&s;ing to GOD.</P>
<P N="4">4th. THAT GOD wills the &s;alvation of man|kind, and is plea&s;ed when we &s;eek happine&s;s by
<PB N="13" REF="026266_0012_0FD0065BDA9A8430">
complying with his divine propo&s;als is evident, from a con&s;ideration of the ample provi&s;ion he has made for our &s;alvation. He made man up|right and completely happy. Withheld no good thing from him, but the u&s;e of one tree, this he prohibited his meddling with for a trial of his obedience, threatned death if he di&s;obeyed. But alas! this did not re&s;train him; he finned and introduced into the world mi&s;ery and death.&mdash;Now my brethren, had GOD delighted in the death of &s;inners, he would have &s;uddenly de|&s;troyed tho&s;e revolters from his government; would &s;uddenly have involved them in that de|&s;truction which is the ju&s;t demerit of &s;in: But &s;aid mercy how &s;hall I give him up! accor|dingly a gracious plan was revealed, for his re|covery. This did not imply any change of mind in the great GOD: but was agreeable to the plan which lay in the divine mind, from all e|ternity, on fore&s;ight of the fall of man; nor does it imply the lea&s;t abatement of his dete&s;tation of &s;in, or mitigation of the puni&s;hment threatened: for though the offender e&s;caped the immediate effects of divine vengeance; yet &s;in was not pardoned without a &s;atisfaction; and it was ter|ribly puni&s;hed in the per&s;on of the glorious &s;on of GOD, who appeared as &s;urety for &s;inful man, our glorious Lord laid down his life to ran&s;om man from de&s;truction. Now is it rational to &s;uppo&s;e that GOD would give his dear &s;on to die for &s;inners, and not be plea&s;ed to have them receive him as their &s;avior, tru&s;ting in him for
<PB N="14" REF="026266_0013_0FD0065EDA482258">
pardon and eternal life? But the objector will &s;ay (perhaps) Chri&s;t died only for the elect, a &s;mall proportion of mankind, but is this the lan|guage of &s;cripture? It has been often &s;aid. It is certainly worth while to inquire whether &s;uch a doctrine is contained in the &s;acred writings. I confe&s;s I know no pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture which repre&s;ents our ble&s;&s;ed Lord as having died only for a few: but many which declare the contra|ry&mdash;He has indeed &s;aid, Matthew vii&mdash;14. &s;trait is the gate, and narrow is the way leading unto life; and few there be that find it. That many are called but few cho&s;en, Matthew xx, 16. But it by no means follows from hence that he did not die to render &s;alvation po&s;&s;ible to all&mdash;But the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages intimate how awfully prone man|kind are to abu&s;e the riches of divine goodne&s;s: neglect the things which belong to their ever|la&s;ting peace.</P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle repre&s;ents our Lord as having ta&s;ted death for every man&mdash;Heb. ii, 9. we &s;ee Je&s;us who was made a little lower than the An|gels for the &s;uffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that he by the grace of GOD &s;hould ta&s;te death for every man.</P>
<P>1 JOHN ii, 2. AND he is the propitiation for our &s;ins, and not for ours only, but al&s;o for the &s;ins of the whole world&mdash;The Apo&s;tle Paul fre|quently mentions his dying for all. II Cor. v, 14. We thus judge, if one died for all (which is ta|ken for granted) then were all dead, I Tim. ii, 6,
<PB N="15" REF="026266_0014_0FD0066041B5AEE0">
Who gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all. And in the 5th to the Romans, the Apo&s;tle repre&s;ents the recovery by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as exten&s;ive as the ruin by Adam, ver&s;e 18, as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men unto con|demnation: even &s;o by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of one the free gift came upon all men unto ju&s;tifica|tion of life. It is exceeding unnatural to &s;up|po&s;e that by the fir&s;t all men are meant, all the de&s;cendants from Adam, and by the latter only a few of them both mu&s;t be under&s;tood preci&s;e|ly in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, to mean the whole human race ruined in Adam and recovered by Chri&s;t. Can any thing be more arbitrary than to &s;ay he ta&s;ted death for every man of the elect. He died for all men of the elect. Is not this an un|couth unnatural and forced con&s;truction of the&s;e &s;criptures?</P>
<P>I SEE no nece&s;&s;ity of concluding from tho&s;e texts with the UNIVERSALISTS, that all men will be finally happy. I am far from this opi|nion, nor, do I believe that the Apo&s;tles de&s;ign|ed to convey this idea; but that our Lord by his death brought all mankind into a &s;alvable &s;tate, and that any mi&s;s of happine&s;s will be their own fault, and not becau&s;e Chri&s;t did not die for them&mdash;&s;eeing GOD has made this provi&s;ion for the &s;alvation of all men it mu&s;t be his will that we accept of his &s;on: and it mu&s;t be ab|&s;urd indeed to &s;uppo&s;e he &s;hould by a fatal de|cree prevent it.</P>

<P>THESE gracious words of the GOD of I&s;|rael give us the &s;ulle&s;t a&s;&s;urance that this glorious and compa&s;&s;ionate being delights not in the &s;in and ruin of his rational creatures; much le&s;s has he made &s;in and mi&s;ery nece&s;&s;ary by a fatal decree. And yet this is the doctrine of &s;ome. And it is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e that the mo&s;t abandoned characters will endeavor to ex|culpate them&s;elves and connections in the com|mi&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t heinous and &s;candalous crimes, and con&s;ole them&s;elves under the in|famy of puni&s;hment with this con&s;ideration, that the&s;e things were decreed from all eternity.&mdash; &s;hocking! to lay the blame upon a &s;inhating GOD. But a merciful GOD has revealed his kind purpo&s;e of &s;alvation to fallen man, and has a&s;&s;ured us in the text and el&s;ewhere, that it is highly plea&s;ing to him that his rational agents comply with his propo&s;als, and thus &s;ecure their own happine&s;s.

<P>ALL this is evident from this con&s;ideration, viz.

<P>HE has declared and &s;worn that he is not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but that all &s;hould come to repentance. That he has no plea&s;ure in the death of the wicked, but that he turn from his way and live; and to effect this u&s;es a variety of means and arguments to pre|vail with men to comply with his gracious &s;cheme&mdash;laments over fallen men that they are &s;o little influenced by &s;uch motives, but choo&s;e the road to death.

&mdash;viz. by con&s;cientious compliance with the go&s;pel? That it mu&s;t be unrea&s;onable to &s;up|po&s;e that a gracious GOD would make &s;uch provi&s;ion at infinite expen&s;e for the &s;alvation of mankind, and have no de&s;ign, no de&s;ire that they &s;hould generally adopt his gracious plan, and obtain an intere&s;t in the purcha&s;ed &s;alvation&mdash;yea de&s;ign and decree the contrary&mdash;and yet at the &s;ame time declare that he takes no plea|&s;ure in the death of the wicked, but that they turn and live, and lament that they will fooli&s;h|ly turn a deaf ear to his calls and ru&s;h down to de&s;truction. What an idea does &s;uch a &s;cheme give us of the great GOD, as a mo&s;t deceitful and trifling being imaginable.</P>
<P>O MY brethren, let us reject with abhorrence a &s;cheme &s;o di&s;honorary to GOD, and injurious to men, and believe a GOD of truth when he a&s;|&s;ures us that he is not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but all &s;hould come to repentance.</P>
<P>BUT it may be objected, many will finally pe|ri&s;h, notwith&s;tanding all the care GOD has ta|ken for their &s;alvation; is this agreeable to his plan? Or is he fru&s;trated in his de&s;igns, de&s;ires and expectations? I know of no way to evade or obviate this objection, but to con&s;ider that GOD has made and deals with men as free a|gents&mdash;He made man though he fore&s;aw that he would &s;in again&s;t him and de&s;troy him&s;elf&mdash; But this opened the way for an a&s;toni&s;hing and
<PB N="28" REF="026266_0027_0FD0068582FD1748">
glorious di&s;play of the divine perfections, in the plan of redemption by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t&mdash; hence mercy and truth have met together, righ|teou&s;ne&s;s and peace have ki&s;&s;ed each other.</P>
<P>HE thus provided for the &s;alvation of his creatures, though he foreknew that multitudes would act an unrea&s;onable and wicked part; would &s;in again&s;t light, would reject the &s;avior, and neglect his religion; would abu&s;e the rich|es of divine goodne&s;s, and trea&s;ure up unto them&s;elves wrath again&s;t the day of wrath, and the revelation of the righteous judgment of GOD. It cannot be doubted that he foreknew all this and probably determined not to prevent it. But this by no means implies any compliance upon the creature, much le&s;s any decree, making &s;uch a wicked conduct nece&s;&s;ary. This is &s;o incon&s;i&s;tant with the divine character, that &s;uch a thought &s;hould never be indulged&mdash;nor does the the divine fore-knowledge of the un|rea&s;onable part mankind would act imply that it was not his will that they &s;hould do better; &s;hould be virtuous and happy. The truth is, he ever deals with mankind as what they are, not mere machines but moral agents, rational and accountable creatures, and this nece&s;&s;arily implies freedom. No man can be accountable for an action which he is compelled to do, GOD (as we have &s;een) provided for the &s;alvation of the children of men, revealed in his word, his kind and gracious de&s;ign, propo&s;ed the terms of

O that there were &s;uch an heart &amp;c. But though &s;inners will fru&s;|trate his kind purpo&s;es re&s;pecting them&s;elves, his perfect fore-knowledge of events prevents all di&s;appointment, and he who is &s;elf-exi&s;tent and independant, who is happy, compleatly and eternally happy in and of him&s;elf, can not be made unhappy by the folly and wickedne&s;s and mi&s;ery of his creatures. On the whole, I can|not doubt my hearers, if you have duly attended to the declarations in &s;cripture, that GOD is ready to pardon, ju&s;tify and &s;ave &s;inners, that he takes no plea&s;ure in their death, &amp;c.
