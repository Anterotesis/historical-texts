<HEAD>Divine righteou&s;ne&s;s in the Salvation, <HI>AND</HI> Damnation of Sinners exhibited.</HEAD>
<P>MR. ROBBINS, has taken for his text Rom. ix. 18. Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth. And pur&s;uant to his de&s;ign, to vindicate the Divine Sovereignty in the Salvation and damnation of Sinners, he 1&s;t propo&s;es,
<Q>To inve&s;tigate the meaning of GOD's having mercy on whom he will have mercy. 2. The meaning of the counter-part to this, and whom he will he hardeneth. 3. Evince, and illu&s;trate this great truth, that it be|longs to GOD&mdash;is his e&s;&s;ential prerogative, to have mer|cy on whom he will have mercy, and to harden whom he will harden. Then, 4. An&s;wer objections. And, 5. Improve the &s;ubject, by deduction, and application.</Q></P>
<P>Under the fir&s;t head, Mr. Robbins con&s;iders the latitude in which the word mercy, when applied to GOD, is &s;ome|times u&s;ed in the Bible. And in page, 9, comes to this conclu&s;ion,
<Q>In the text, particular reference is had to &s;aving mercy.</Q>
He explains him&s;elf more fully in page, 13,
<Q>They on whom he hath mercy are regenerated, are united to Chri&s;t, are ju&s;tified, and &s;hall be &s;aved: See|ing, as hath been ob&s;erved, there is a particular refer|ence, not to common and promi&s;cuous; but to &s;pecial and &s;aving mercy. Con&s;equently, by the hardened we are to under&s;tand the&s;e who are, or &s;hall be left in an impenitent unbelieving &s;tate to the la&s;t&mdash;to their eternal ruin and de&s;truction.</Q>
In page, 38, he &s;ays,
<Q>Re|pentance is implied in GOD's having mercy on any, in the &s;en&s;e of the text; and impenitence continued to the la&s;t is implied in his hardening whom he will.</Q>
In page,
<PB N="4" REF="026990_0003_0FD2B465A4894580">
39, he &s;ays,
<Q>It belongs to GOD&mdash;is his e&s;&s;ential prero|gative to determine the character, and di&s;po&s;e of the eternal &s;tate of men; in holine&s;s and &s;alvation, or in &s;in and damnation, according to his own good plea&s;ure.</Q>
From the&s;e quotations, and others of like import that might be made, it is p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ain to me, that when Mr. Rob|bins &s;ays,
<Q>In the text, particular reference is had to &s;a|ving mercy.</Q>
He means &s;uch mercy as is in&s;eparably connected with eternal life. And by hardened, to u&s;e his own words,
<Q>We are to under&s;tand tho&s;e who are, or &s;hall be left in an impenitent unbelieving &s;tate to the la&s;t, to their eternal ruin and de&s;truction.</Q>
While tho&s;e on whom he hath mercy, to u&s;e his own words,
<Q>Are regenerated, are united to Chri&s;t, are ju&s;tified, and &s;hall be &s;aved.</Q>
That the meaning of the text, accor|ding to Mr. Robbins, is plainly this, I will have mercy, i. e. &s;ave eternally whom I will, and harden, i. e. damn eternally whom I will. His own words are,
<Q>It be|longs to GOD&mdash;is his e&s;&s;ential prerogative, to determine the character, and di&s;po&s;e of the eternal &s;tate of men, in holine&s;s and &s;alvation, or in &s;in and damnation, accor|ding to his own good plea&s;ure.</Q></P>
<P>Wherefore, if Mr. Robbins is right, the election and reprobation the Apo&s;tle is arguing about in this chapter, is election by an ab&s;olute decree and purpo&s;e of GOD to eternal life, with re&s;pect to &s;ome men: and reprobation by a like ab&s;olute decree to eternal mi&s;ery, with re&s;pect to others. But, that this is not the meaning of the Apo&s;tle, in the 9th Chapter to the Romans; is what he had no thought of, as it lay quite wide of his de&s;ign, through this whole Chapter, I think I can ea&s;ily demon&s;trate. But as the &s;overeignty of GOD, is one thing which Mr. Robbins de&s;igns, very &s;pecially to &s;how by his di&s;cour&s;e. I &s;hall therefore, reply to him in the method following, viz.</P>

<P>Fir&s;t, I am to &s;how what we are to believe concern|ing the &s;overeignty of GOD. Now it is very evident, both from rea&s;on and &s;cripture; that Almighty GOD, as the creator and governor of mankind, &s;u&s;tains a double character; as &s;overeign benefactor and righteous judge. As creator and &s;overeign benefactor, GOD has a right to be, and actually is partial in the di&s;tribution of his grace. But as governor and judge, he is and ever will be impar|tial in the di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice. The doctrine of partial grace is held up to view, in Matthew xx. 15. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? And Chap. xxv, 34, 15. For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own &s;ervants, and delivered unto them his goods: And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his &s;everal ability. The&s;e &s;criptures hold forth a partial election, and a par|tial reprobation; both flowing from a free, wi&s;e, and &s;overeign grace, which is notoriou&s;ly re&s;pective of per|&s;ons.</P>
<P>By this partial election and reprobation of free grace, I mean, the choice which GOD, as a &s;overeign benefac|tor, makes or refu&s;es to make of &s;ome per&s;ons, church|es, cities and nations, to be&s;tow or withhold favours from them. It is the partiality, with which he imparts his talents, of nature, providence and grace to his creatures; giving five talents to &s;ome, two to others, and but one to others. This partiality of GOD, di&s;covered in di&s;pen|&s;ing his favours to his creatures, is doubtle&s;s in perfect wi&s;dom: but by no rules or methods of proceeding that we are acquainted with. The time when we &s;hall exi&s;t, the country where we &s;hall live, our parents, our con&s;ti|tution of body and turn of mind; the&s;e and numberle&s;s
<PB N="6" REF="026990_0005_0FD2B468B167B868">
other circum&s;tances are doubtle&s;s ordered wi&s;ely; but by rules that lay quite out of our &s;ight. Plain it is, that, GOD is good and gracious to all men; but it is as plain that he is not equally gracious: For he gives to &s;ome per&s;ons, families, churches and nations, more power and opportunity to do and receive good, more means of grace, more excellent means, more time to u&s;e tho&s;e means, and more energy of the &s;pirit in the u&s;e of them, than he gives to other per&s;ons, famil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, churches and nations. And this great partiality in God, which appears in the be&s;towment of his favours, is in no degree cau&s;ed by the works of the creatures; nay, &s;o far from this, it, is it|&s;elf the fir&s;t cau&s;e of all natural excellencies and evangel|ical worthine&s;s.</P>
<P>Uncreated Adam, did nothing to merit that di&s;tin|gui&s;hing election, which rai&s;ed him above the fir&s;t Ox: nor did the fir&s;t Ox, do any thing to de&s;erve to be repro|bated from all knowledge of his maker, and everla&s;ting|ly &s;hut out of the kingdom of heaven.</P>
<P>The Lark, did nothing to merit her election to tow|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ring flight and &s;prightly &s;ongs; nor did the poor Oy&s;ter do any thing to de&s;erve &s;uch a reprobation, to be &s;hut up between two &s;hells, without legs or wings. We may trace the foot&s;teps of an electing or reprobating provi|dence all the earth over; with re&s;pect to per&s;ons and places. We &s;ee one elected to &s;way a &s;ceptre, another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bated to handle a &s;pade. We &s;ee a rich glutton <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d to a plentiful fortune, while poor Lazarus, a no|torious reprobate of providence, lays &s;tarving at the door of me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s plenty. We &s;ee one elected to enjoy the ble&s;&s;ing of the five &s;en&s;es, the advantage of a &s;trong con&s;titution, and the prerogative of beauty; whil&s;t another is born blind or deaf, &s;ickly or deformed; but the poor creature has done nothing to de&s;erve &s;uch a re|probation; nor the other to merit &s;uch election. But with &s;uch apparent partiality does the great Lord of all di&s;pen&s;e, not only his providential ble&s;&s;ings, but like|wi&s;e his &s;piritual favours: as every one may &s;ee who takes a view of the &s;cripture account of the covenants of pro|mi&s;e, which GOD made at different times with &s;avoured
<PB N="7" REF="026990_0006_0FD2B4ACC2065B38">
men, families, churches and nations: peculiar cove|nants which flowed every one from a peculiar election of grace; by which we may &s;ee the election and reprobation of partial grace mo&s;t clearly. But GOD Almighty has a throne of ju&s;tice, as well as a throne of grace.</P>
<P>The doctrine of impartial ju&s;tice, is held forth in &s;uch &s;criptures as the&s;e, Luke, ix. 26, I &s;ay unto you, that to every one who hath, more &s;hall be given: and from him who hath not, even that he hath, &s;hall be taken away from him. Rev. iii. 4, Thou ha&s;t a few names even in Sardis, which have not defiled their garments; and they &s;hall walk with me in white: for they are wor|thy. Here is held forth an impartial election and an impartial reprobation; both flowing from divine ju&s;tice; which is always irre&s;pective of per&s;ons. The impartial election and reprobation of ju&s;tice is the righteous choice, which GOD makes or refu&s;es to make of &s;ome per&s;ons, churches, cities and nations, to reward them according to his promi&s;es, or puni&s;h them according to his threat|nings.</P>
<P>St. Paul, has taught us, that GOD will render to every man according to his deeds; to them who by patient continuance in well doing&mdash;eternal life: but unto them that obey unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, indignation and wealth. Rom. ii. 6, 7, 8. The &s;ame doctrine is taught by the Prophet I&s;aiah, Chap. iii. 10, 11; Say ye to the righteous, it &s;hall b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> well with him; for they &s;hall eat the fro&s;t of their doings. Wo to the wicked: it &s;hall be ill with him; for the reward of his hands &s;hall be given him. The &s;ame we have in Ezek. xviii. 30; Therefore I will judge you, O hou&s;e of I&s;rael, every one according to his ways, &s;aith the Lord GOD: Repent, and turn your|&s;elves from all your tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; &s;o iniquity &s;hall not be your ruin. But this doctrine is taught by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne more clearly, than by our Lord Je&s;us, in his la&s;t charge, Rev. xxii. 12; Behold I come quickly; and my reward is with one, to give every man according as his works &s;hall be. The election of ju&s;tice is then nothing but the im|partiality, with which GOD makes choice of his good and faithful &s;ervants, rather than his wicked and &s;lothful
<PB N="8" REF="026990_0007_0FD2B46A07D2DA78">
&s;ervants, to be&s;tow upon them the temporal and eternal reward of goodne&s;s and faithfulne&s;s, according to their works; when he cometh and reckoneth with them, about the talents which his free grace be&s;towed upon them. Nor is the reprobation of ju&s;tice any thing, but the im|partiality with which GOD as a righteous judge and di&s;|pen&s;or of his puni&s;hments, reprobates from his rewards of grace and glory, his wicked and unfaithful &s;ervants, who do not u&s;e, or who vilely abu&s;e the talents, which his free grace entru&s;ted them with.</P>
<P>The full <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ide of &s;cripture evidently flows in the&s;e two channels; an election of partial grace, according to which GOD grants or denies original favours as a &s;over|eign benefactor; and an election of impartial ju&s;tice, ac|cording to which he be&s;tows rewards and inflicts pun|i&s;hments as a &s;upreme judge. And as from the uncon|ditional, per&s;onal, partial election of grace, there fol|lows a harmle&s;s, unconditional, per&s;onal reprobation; as in the ca&s;e of Jacob and E&s;au, for while Jacob and the I&s;raelites were peculiarly loved, E&s;au and the Edo|mites were comparatively hated, i. e. while the I&s;raelites were greatly favoured, the Edomites were le&s;s favoured. So likewi&s;e from the conditional impartial election of ju&s;tice; there follows an impartial reprobation; for when the righteous are rewarded the wicked &s;hall be puni&s;hed; when the judge &s;hall &s;ay to tho&s;e that have done well, come ye ble&s;&s;ed, he will &s;ay to tho&s;e that have done ill, depart ye cur&s;ed.</P>
<P>Thus although GOD di&s;pen&s;es his favours as benefac|tor and Lord with a partial hand, by rules that lay quite out of our fight; and according to the in&s;crutable coun&s;el of his own will: yet his method of dealing with us as lawgiver, governor and judge, is perfectly known, being clearly revealed in the word, namely, that he will render to every man according to his works.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If any would wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to &s;ee this &s;ubject more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, they may find it excellently well done in the ingenious Mr. Fletcher's works, Vol. 3. p. 250.</NOTE> Now, keeping in view the &s;overeign partiality; which the great Lord of all has right to, and actually does exerci&s;e in
<PB N="9" REF="026990_0008_0FD2B4B2068528B0">
di&s;pen&s;ing, primiary and original favours: and the righteous impartiality and exact ju&s;tice, with which he as law-giver and judge forever rewards and puni&s;hes; we will try by this key to open the ninth chapter in St. Pauls Epi&s;tle to the Romans, which was the &s;econd thing propo&s;ed to be done, and to which I now come. 2 To give a brief explanation, of the ix chap. to the Rom. It will doubtle&s;s be allowed that before the coming of Chri&s;t, the Church, or peculiar kingdom of GOD's grace, was confined to the Jewi&s;h nation; including only &s;uch heathen, as were incorporated among them by becoming Jews and ob&s;erving the whole Law of Mo&s;es. And the Jews firmly believed it would always be &s;o. Even the be&s;t men among them, Chri&s;t's own di&s;ciples not excep|ted; appear to have no apprehen&s;ion of an alteration in this re&s;pect. Accordingly when our Lord came, and revealed this my&s;tery of God, which before was hid, both from Jews and Gentiles; namely, that the Gentiles &s;hould be called by the go&s;pel, and freely admitted into the Church, under the Me&s;&s;iah, and upon the &s;ame terms that the Jews them&s;elves were admitted; it was univer|&s;ally oppo&s;ed by the Jews. And although GOD's owning the Gentiles; by pouring out the holy gho&s;t upon them, in various miraculous gifts, did &s;atisfy in good mea&s;ure the chri&s;tian Jews at Jeru&s;alem, who were di&s;gu&s;ted at Peter, for treating the fir&s;t uncircumci&s;ed Gentile con|verts, as members of the church of GOD, Acts, xi. 2, 3, And extorted from them this confe&s;&s;ion, namely, Thou hath GOD al&s;o to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life, which they believed could not have been granted unto them, without obedience to the law of Mo&s;es. But the unbelieving Jews paid no regard to this, or any other argument in favour of the uncircumci&s;ed Gentiles.</P>
<P>The notion of admitting them into the church of GOD, only upon faith of Chri&s;t, they oppo&s;ed and per&s;ecuted every where, with great zeal and bitterne&s;s. And it &s;eems it was not long before good impre&s;&s;ions wore off, and old prejudices revived, even among the believing Jews.</P>
<P>Numbers of them very &s;tifly, and with much conten|tion,
<PB N="10" REF="026990_0009_0FD2B46B9AC96FE8">
endeavoured to per&s;uade the Gentile converts, that except they were circumci&s;ed after the manner of Mo&s;es, they could not be &s;aved, i. e. admitted to the privileges of the kingdom of GOD, and the hope of eternal life, Acts, xv. 1, 2.</P>
<P>But had the Jewi&s;h notion prevailed, that no part of mankind could have any &s;hare in the ble&s;&s;ings of GOD's mo&s;t gracious covenant, the pardon of &s;in, and the hope of eternal life, but only &s;uch as were circumci&s;ed, and brought them&s;elves under obligations to the law of Mo|&s;es; the exten&s;ive &s;cheme of the go&s;pel would have been ruined, and the gracious de&s;ign of freeing the church from the embarra&s;&s;ments of the law of Mo&s;es, would have been defeated.</P>
<P>The glad tidings of &s;alvation by Chri&s;t, mu&s;t, not on|ly have been confined to the narrow limits of the Jewi&s;h peculiarity, and clogged with all the ceremonial ob&s;er|vances belonging to it: but had the go&s;pel been built upon the foundation of the Jewi&s;h polity, it mu&s;t have been totally de&s;troyed when that was demoli&s;hed; and &s;o the whole peculiar kingdom of GOD in the world would have been overthrown and extinct at the &s;ame time: and all the light it was calculated to diffu&s;e throughout the world, would have been quite extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>This was therefore a matter of the greate&s;t importance to be clearly and fully determined and &s;ettled, namely, whether the Jewi&s;h pale &s;hould &s;tand or not, or whether, the Gentile converts might be trea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d as members of the church of GOD without becoming Jews, and ob&s;erving circumci&s;ion and the law of Mo&s;es. And as St. Paul was commi&s;&s;ioned to preach the go&s;pel to the Gentiles, it became his duty, to prove, that we Gentiles are the children of GOD, intere&s;ted in his covenant, and all the honours, ble&s;&s;ings and privileges of his family and king|dom here upon earth, only by faith in Chri&s;t, without coming under any obligations to the law of Mo&s;es, as &s;uch, which is the main drift and &s;ubject of this Epi&s;tle; which the Apo&s;tle begins, by &s;howing, Jews and Gen|tiles to be equally &s;inful and obnoxious to wrath; and therefore, there was no way for the Jews to be continued
<PB N="11" REF="026990_0010_0FD2B4B2B66C8A78">
in the kingdom of GOD, but by grace, through faith; and by grace and faith the Gentiles might be admitted into it. But as this would of cour&s;e overthrow the Jew|i&s;h peculiarity; &s;o likewi&s;e it would from hence follow, that all tho&s;e Jews, who do not embrace the faith of the go&s;pel, are ca&s;t out of the pale of the vi&s;ible church, and the kingdom of GOD taken from them.</P>
<P>Now as nothing could be more di&s;agreeable to the Jews than this doctrine; they accordingly levelled all their artillery again&s;t the Gentiles being called, or invited into the church or kingdom of GOD; and laboured every argument to unhinge the believing Gentiles, and per|&s;uade them, that they were not duly taken into the church. Therefore, to prove, that the Jews, by rejec|ting Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel, were them&s;elves ca&s;t out of the church, con&s;i&s;tantly with the truth of GOD's promi&s;e to Abraham, was a matter of the greate&s;t moment, to convince and confound the unbelieving Jews, and e&s;tab|li&s;h the Gentile believers.</P>
<P>And this the Apo&s;tle &s;ets him&s;elf, more e&s;pecially to do in the ix chap. to the Rom. Which he begins by declaring that it was the truth, that compelled him to the execution of this part of his commi&s;&s;ion, as Apo&s;tle of the Gentiles; and not ill-will to his countrymen; in who&s;e rejection, he was &s;o far from taking plea&s;ure, that it was a continual grief and &s;orrow to him; and the rath|er &s;o, he, having had an experimental acquaintance, with the prejudices they were under, with re&s;pect to Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel, ver. 1, 2, 3. In the 4th and 5th ver. he re|counts the honours and privileges, which his country|men the Jews, as the church of GOD had long enjoyed. Then ver. 6, proceeds to an&s;wer an objection that might he made again&s;t the rejection of the Jews; notwith&s;tan|ding the infidelity of the greate&s;t part of them, groun|ded upon the promi&s;e of GOD to Abraham, Gen. xvii. 7, 8: I will e&s;tabli&s;h my covenant between me and thee, and thy &s;eed after thee, for an everla&s;ting covenant; to be a GOD unto thee, and thy &s;eed after thee.</P>
<P>Now if the Jews were reduced to a level with the na|tions that lie out of the church, and excluded from the
<PB N="12" REF="026990_0011_0FD2B46D09703E98">
common-wealth, to which they once belonged, will it not follow; that GOD hath failed in the performance of his promi&s;e to Abraham? To this the Apo&s;tle an&s;wers ver. 6: That they are not all I&s;rael which are of I&s;rael, i. e. the Jews are not the whole of the I&s;rael of GOD com|prehended in the promi&s;e. For Abraham is the father of many nations; and his &s;eed is, not only that which is of the law, but that al&s;o which is of the faith of Abra|ham. Ver. 7, 8, 9, He ob&s;erves they had no right to conclude, that, becau&s;e they are the natural de&s;cends <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts of Abraham, therefore they are all of them, without ex|ception, the children in whom the promi&s;e is to be ful|filled. For the promi&s;e never was confined to natural de&s;cent, but may be accompli&s;hed in any part of Abra|hams &s;eed, as GOD in his &s;overeign plea&s;ure &s;hall &s;ee &s;it; as appears from the rejection of I&s;hmael and the election of I&s;aac.</P>
<P>And le&s;t it &s;hould be &s;aid, that I&s;hmael was rejected not by the &s;overeign will of GOD, but becau&s;e he was the &s;on of the bond woman, and therefore unworthy to be the peculiar &s;eed. Therefore the Apo&s;tle in&s;tances in another limitation of the &s;eed of Abraham, namely, the twin children of I&s;aac by Rebecca, before they were born, or had done either good or evil, that the purpo&s;e of GOD according to election might &s;tand; it was &s;aid, the elder &s;hall &s;erve the younger, Jacob have I loved, but E&s;au have I hated. In this ca&s;e it cannot be &s;aid, that E&s;au was reprobated becau&s;e profane and wicked, or Jacob loved becau&s;e he was righteous, for they had not done either good to de&s;erve, or evil to forfeit the divine favour: See ver. 10, 11, 12, 13.&mdash;This plainly demon|&s;trates; that the purpo&s;e and intention of GOD, accor|ding to his own free choice, is the only rule and &s;tan|dard of be&s;towing priminary and original favours: on men and nations; not of works, but the good plea&s;ure of GOD alone that called Jacob and the Jews to be his peculiar people, while E&s;au and his po&s;terity were re|probated, from the peculiar privileges of the church of GOD. And none may conclude, that GOD's be&s;towing religious privileges in &s;uch an unequal manner upon tho&s;e,
<PB N="13" REF="026990_0012_0FD2B4B3CF3C92E0">
who otherwi&s;e are in equal circum&s;tances, is contrary to equity and right; as the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, ver. 14. For &s;urely GOD may do what he will with his own.</P>
<P>GOD did no wrong to man, becau&s;e he made Angels; no wrong to the mou&s;e, becau&s;e he made the elephant: no wrong to the herring becau&s;e he made the whale, nor any wrong to E&s;au, becau&s;e he gave his brother five talents, when he gave him but two.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice is not concerned in be&s;towing original favours; but GOD as &s;overeign Lord and benefactor, di&s;pen&s;es the&s;e, with the mo&s;t notorious partiality, without any wrong or inju&s;tice to his creatures. Here let it be noti|ced, that the in&s;tances alledged by the Apo&s;tle, wherein the great Lord of all had di&s;covered his &s;overeignty, in the choice of per&s;ons to enjoy peculiar privileges, doth not re&s;pect the per&s;ons them&s;elves &s;o much as their po&s;te|rity. And it has no re&s;pect to the eternal &s;tate of either. This will appear plain to any one that looks into the texts in Gen. from whence they are quoted.</P>
<P>Of I&s;hmael 'tis &s;aid Gen. xvii. 20: Twelve Princes &s;hall he beget, and I will make him a great nation. So of Jacob and E&s;au, it was &s;aid to Rebecca, Gen. xxv. 23: Two nations are in thy womb, two manner of peo|ple &s;hall be &s;eperated from thy bowels, the one people &s;hall be &s;tronger than the other people, and the elder &s;hall &s;erve the younger; which &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, was &s;aid that the purpo&s;e of GOD according to election might &s;tand, ver. 11.12. So that this mu&s;t be an election of people and not of particular per&s;ons, for it never was fact in the per&s;ons them&s;elves. So likewi&s;e the next words, Jacob have I loved and E&s;au have I hated, quo|ted from Mal. 1, 2, 3, are manife&s;tly to be under&s;tood of the nations that were to de&s;cend from the&s;e per&s;ons, and not the per&s;ons them&s;elves.</P>
<P>For ought that appears E&s;au had as many talents as Jacob. The words of the text in Mal. are, I loved Ja|cob and hated E&s;au, and laid his mountains and heritage wa&s;te for the dragons of the wilderne&s;s; whereas Edom &s;aith, we are impover&s;hied, &amp;c. This is evidently &s;po|ken of the people, and &s;olely with regard to their condi|tion
<PB N="14" REF="026990_0013_0FD2B46F56150F98">
in this world.&mdash;Let it be further noted here, that by GOD's ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g the po&s;terity of E&s;au, we are not to under|&s;tand ab&s;olute <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tred, for they had a good ble&s;&s;ing; though not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> good a one as the po&s;terity of Jacob. Yet it is certain GOD loved them, and ble&s;&s;ed them; and hatred is no more intended, than when our Lord &s;ays as in Luke xiv. 26: He that hateth not father and mother &amp;c. cannot be my di&s;ciple: where he cannot be under|&s;tood to mean hatred, unle&s;s he contradict him&s;elf&mdash;but means what is expre&s;&s;ed, Mat. x. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">7. He that loveth father and mother more than me is not worthy of me. So GOD's hating E&s;au's po&s;terity and loving Jacobs, means nothing more than this, namely that he be&s;towed le&s;s talents and privileges on the one, than on the other. Such a highly figurative way of &s;peaking, di&s;tingui&s;hes the Hebrew language from all others, that I am ac|quainted with; and which if not attended to, we can never under&s;tand the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>We &s;hould ever remember, that as all creatures are equally related to GOD by creation; &s;o they are equally loved by him. And if any creature has a greater &s;hare in the Creators love than another, it is wholly owing to the improvement the creature has made of the grace the Creator be&s;towed upon it. The Lord loveth the right|eous, becau&s;e they do right: And he hateth the wicked becau&s;e they do wrong.</P>
<P>We have now con&s;idered this chapter, to the 15 ver. &s;o far as we have gone, the Apo&s;tle, has con&s;idered GOD's choo&s;ing or refu&s;ing any body of men in general, without &s;uppo&s;ing them to be wicked, or to have forfeited the di|vine favour by &s;in. But it is evident from the &s;criptural quotations, that from ver. 15 to 23, he con&s;iders them in quite another light; namely, as corrupt, wicked and de&s;erving de&s;truction; and as &s;uch re&s;pited and condi|tionally pardoned, by the pure mercy of GOD, or ruined by his righteous judgments. Which brings his argu|ment to the very ca&s;e of the Jews.</P>
<P>In order clearly to under&s;tand the Apo&s;tle in the&s;e ver|&s;es next to be con&s;idered, it mu&s;t be remembered, that the Apo&s;tle in the quotations he makes from the Old
<PB N="15" REF="026990_0014_0FD2B4B526F9BCC8">
Te&s;tament; doth not give the whole of the text, but only a hint or reference to the pa&s;&s;ages, to which they belong, directing us to recollect, peru&s;e the whole pa&s;|&s;ages, and there view and judge of the force of his argu|ments. This is evident from the Apo&s;tles having words in his conclu&s;ions ver. 16 and 18, which are not in his arguments; as any one may &s;ee that reads with atten|tion.&mdash;</P>
<P>This promi&s;ed we will attend to the Apo&s;tles argu|ment, by which he proves that GOD is &s;overeign, in ta|king forfeited favours from a wicked per&s;on or people; or in mercy continuing them according to his own good plea&s;ure. For this he quotes the words of GOD to Mo|&s;es, recorded Exod. xxxiii. 19, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compa&s;&s;ion on whom I will have compa&s;&s;ion. Now in order to under|&s;tand the Apo&s;tles argument from the&s;e words quoted by him, we mu&s;t read and con&s;ider well the xxxii and xxxiii chapters of Exodus. And here we find, that while Mo|&s;es was in the mount, receiving the law from God, a tu|multuous addre&s;s is made by the people to Aaron, up, make us GOD's, &amp;c. In con&s;equence of which, a molten calf is made, and wor&s;hipped by the people. Upon which GOD acquaints Mo&s;es, with the idolatry of the people, expre&s;&s;eth his di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t it, and the re|&s;olves of his ju&s;tice to cut them off. Then Mo&s;es be|comes an interce&s;&s;or; and obtains a reprieve.&mdash;And GOD promi&s;es to go on with his kind intention of giving them the land of Canaan for all this: Yet he threatens to remember this &s;in again&s;t them, when hereafter he &s;hould &s;ee cau&s;e to puni&s;h them for their other &s;ins.</P>
<P>This, as Mr. Henry ob&s;erves, occa&s;ioned this &s;aying among the Jews, that from hence forward no judgment fell upon I&s;rael, but there was in it an ounce of the pow|der of the golden calf. And even now immediately GOD plagued the people, becau&s;e of this.</P>
<P>Thus much we find in the xxxii chap. In the xxx<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i chap. we have a further account of the mediation of Mo&s;es between GOD and I&s;rael. Mo&s;es had obtained &s;ee them a promi&s;e that the covenant w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th Abraham &s;hould
<PB N="16" REF="026990_0015_0FD2B473D1AEFE28">
be made good, in giving them the land of Canaan; yet they are denied the extraordinary tokens of GOD's pre|&s;ence, hitherto enjoyed, and they left to the conduct of Mo&s;es, and the convoy of an Angel. But Mo&s;es inter|cedes for the divine pre&s;ence, and obtains a promi&s;e of that al&s;o, &s;ee ver. 14, And upon Mo&s;es' reque&s;ting a &s;ight of the divine glory; GOD &s;aid, I will make all my goodne&s;s pa&s;s before thee, and will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee, and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will &s;hew mercy on whom I will &s;hew mercy. As if he had &s;aid; my goodne&s;s is my glo|ry, and I will make &s;uch a di&s;play of it before thee, as fully to convince thee, that I am of a kind and benefici|ent nature. But know thou, that I &s;pare this &s;tiffnecked people, not becau&s;e either you, who intercede for them, or they them&s;elves, have any claim upon my favour: but of my own free and &s;overeign grace, I choo&s;e to &s;hew them mercy and compa&s;&s;ion; and not at this time bring that ruin upon them, which their &s;in ju&s;tly de&s;erves. From hence the Apo&s;tle concludes, as in ver. 16. So then, it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that run|neth, but of GOD that &s;heweth mercy, i. e. the making or continuing any body of men the peculiar people of GOD, after they have by &s;in forfeited the divine favour, is determined, not by the de&s;ires and wi&s;hes of men, but by the good plea&s;ure of GOD alone.</P>
<P>For Abraham de&s;ired this ble&s;&s;ing for I&s;hmael, and I&s;aac for E&s;au, but Abraham and I&s;aac who willed, and E&s;au who run for this mercy of being GOD's peculiar peo|ple, GOD of his mere good plea&s;ure, originally intended fir&s;t for I&s;aac, and then for Jacob and his po&s;terity, and to them it was given. And when, by their apo&s;tacy, they had forefited this privilege, it was not Mo&s;es' wil|ling, nor any obligation God was under, but his own &s;overeign mercy which continued the enjoyment of it to them. For in&s;tead of &s;hewing the I&s;raelites mercy, and continuing to them the peculiar privileges of his church and people, he might have &s;ignalized his anger, power and ju&s;tice in their de&s;truction; as he did in the ca&s;e of Pharaoh and the Egyptians.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="026990_0016_0FD2B4B6933E9320">To who&s;e ca&s;e the Apo&s;tle alludes in the 17th ver. And ob&s;erves that although Pharaoh was made to &s;tand through ten plagues, yet was treated with much greater &s;everity then the Jews were, whom God conditionally pardoned, and continued to be his peculiar people, not|with&s;tanding their rebellion. But the fir&s;t good oppor|tunity, to make Pharaoh and the Egyptians an illu&s;trious example of the divine vengeance is taken. Thus it ap|pears that God treats not all &s;inners alike, for while with &s;ome he waits long, on others he brings a &s;wift de&s;truct|ion; according to his own good plea&s;ure. From hence the Apo&s;tle concludes as in v. 18. Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth. By mercy here, the Apo&s;tle means nothing more, than GOD's re&s;piting a wicked people from de&s;erved ruin, and continuing to them the ble&s;&s;ings of providence and the enjoyment of vi&s;ible Church privile|ges; is too evident to admit of proof. And that by hardeneth, he means nothing el&s;e, than bringing de|&s;erved ruin upon a wicked per&s;on or people, is equally plain; as the Apo&s;tle evidently alludes to the &s;tory of Pharaoh and the Egyptians. To this the Apo&s;tle was aware, the Jews would object as in v. 19. Why doth he yet find fault? for who hath re&s;i&s;ted his will; i. e. If GOD, according to his own will, thus differently treats criminals, &s;paring &s;ome and bringing ruin upon others: why doth he yet find fault with, and hold guilty tho&s;e he &s;pares? for if it be his will to &s;pare them, yet hold them guil|ty and liable to puni&s;hment when ever he plea&s;es; they mu&s;t remain guilty, for who hath re&s;i&s;ted his will? To this the Apo&s;tle replies v. 20, by &s;hewing that its quite unfit for weak and ignorant man, to retort upon GOD his maker.</P>
<P>In v. 21, the Apo&s;tle alludes to the parable of the Potter, Jere. xviii. 1. to illu&s;trate the &s;overeign right that Almighty God has, to exalt one and depre&s;s a|nother. To make one more honorable and another le&s;s honorable, according to his own plea&s;ure. This premi&s;|ed, the Apo&s;tle comes more directly to an&s;wer the object|ion of the Jew, v. 22. What if GOD willing to &s;hew his
<PB N="18" REF="026990_0017_0FD2B4784E549440">
wrath, &amp;c. i. e. what can any object again&s;t GOD's choo&s;ing a time to puni&s;h the wicked, according to their wickedne&s;s; when it will mo&s;t redown to his own glory; and &s;u&s;pending their de&s;truction till that time comes? For in&s;tance, in the ca&s;e of the Jews; what wrong is it to them? If GOD de&s;igning more &s;ignally to di&s;play his vindictive ju&s;tice, and Almighty power, in overthrowing their con&s;titution, nation, and temple, that all may &s;ee, and be &s;en&s;ible; that rebellion again&s;t him was the cau&s;e of their dreadful overthrow, hath thought fit to forbear them with much patience, even when they were proper &s;ubjects of puni&s;hments, and to re&s;pite the de&s;truction they had long de&s;erved, to &s;uch a period, as would effec|tually do this; as he did in the ca&s;e of Pharaoh and the Egyptians. In the 23d and 24th v. the Apo&s;tle, &s;ugge&s;ts another rea&s;on why the Jews were &s;pared &s;o long, name|ly, that he might di&s;play his glorious grace, on tho&s;e, who before that Judgment was executed on them; were prepared for the honour of being his church and people, in &s;tead of the Jewi&s;h nation, i. e. all Chri&s;tians whom he had called to the faith and privileges of the go&s;pel, not only from among the Jews, but al&s;o from among the Gentiles. For although the Jews were fit for de|&s;truction long before, they were de&s;troyed, yet the fite&s;t time to de&s;troy them, was, after he had prepared the believing Gentiles unto the glory of being his church and people. The Apo&s;tle nextly proceeds, by two quotations, from the prophet Ho&s;ea, in the 25th and 26th v. to &s;hew that GOD intended to make the Gentiles his people, and declared it by that prophet. Then in, v. 27, 28 and 29. He &s;hews by quotations from the prophet I&s;aiah, that it is no new thing for GOD to abandon the greate&s;t part of the Jewi&s;h nation, when corrupt, and to confine his fa|vour to a righteous, believing few. Thus having vindi|cated the rejection of the Jews, from vi&s;ible Church pri|vileges; and the calling of the Gentiles thereto, with re|gard to the divine veracity and ju&s;tice; the Apo&s;tle pro|ceeds, v. 30, 31 and 32, to give the rea&s;on, why the Jews were ca&s;t off from being GOD's people, and the Gentiles admitted to that privilege. The Jews for re|jecting,
<PB N="19" REF="026990_0018_0FD2B4B80F2019D0">
the &s;cheme of life, publi&s;hed in the Go&s;pel, are &s;hut out from vi&s;ible Church privileges; and the Gen|tiles by embracing it are adopted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the family and Church of God. Then v 33, by a quotation from the prophet I&s;aiah he &s;hews this rejection of the Jews, and the cau&s;e thereof, as he had &s;tated it, was long ago fore|told.</P>
<P>Thus I have brie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y explained this chapter, about which &s;o much difficulty has been made. And I give it as my opinion, there is not a chapter in the Bible more ea&s;y to under&s;tand than this, if men would read it without bias, in favour of preconceived opinions.</P>
<P>But as all depends upon the kind of Election and Re|probation the Apo&s;tle is arguing about; mentioned v. 11, That the purpo&s;e of GOD according to election might &s;tand, &amp;c. If it be election, by the ab&s;olute decree of GOD, to eternal life; and reprobation, by a like ab&s;o|lute decree, to eternal mi&s;ery: Mr. R. is perfectly right. But if it be only election to &s;ome pre&s;ent privileges and external advantages, to be enjoyed in this world; and reprobation, or rejection, as it &s;ignifies the not being favoured with tho&s;e privileges and advantages: Mr. R. is wholly wrong, and has totally mi&s;taken the Apo&s;tle in this chapter. Wherefore, I come as propo&s;ed.</P>
<P N="3">3. To &s;hew that Mr. R. is totally mi&s;taken, as to what the Apo&s;tle means by election and reprobation in this chapter. And this I &s;hall do by the following ar|guments.</P>
<P>ARGUMENT 1. If the &s;ubject of the Apo&s;tles argu|ment, is only &s;uch privileges, as were enjoyed by the I&s;ralites in this world; while they remained the church of GOD: Then the election &s;poke of by the Apo&s;tle in this chapter, is not ab&s;olute election to eternal life. But, &amp;c.&mdash;Ergo.</P>
<P>The major, is evident from the enumeration the Apo&s;tle had made of the I&s;raelites privileges, v. 4 and 5. Who are I&s;raelites, to whom pertains the adoption, &amp;c. And the&s;e privileges were enjoyed by them in this world, while they were the Church and people of GOD. And it is &s;olely with reference to their being &s;tripped of the&s;e privi|leges,
<PB N="20" REF="026990_0019_0FD2B47DCF4FCCC0">
that he vindicates the truth and ju&s;tice of GOD, it the following ver&s;es. Therefore it is not ab&s;olute elect|ion to eternal life that the Apo&s;tle here treats of.</P>
<P>ARG. 2. If the election &s;poke of in this chapter re|&s;pects all Jacob's po&s;terity, or the whole nation of I&s;rael, then it is not ab&s;olute election to eternal life: But, &amp;c.&mdash;Ergo&mdash;</P>
<P>That the election &s;poke of in this chapter is rational, is, evident from Gen. xxv. 23. The LORD &s;aid unto her, two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people &s;hall be &s;eparated from thy bowels, and the one people &s;hall be &s;tronger than the other people, and the elder &s;hall &s;erve the younger. The&s;e are the words which &s;ig|nify the purpo&s;e of GOD according to election. There|fore the election refers to the whole nation of I&s;rael. But all the nation of I&s;rael were not ab&s;olutely elected to eternal life. Therefore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>ARG. 3. If to &s;erve, which was to be the condition of the elder, in &s;cripture, never &s;ignifies to be eternally damned in the world to come; then the oppo&s;ite ble&s;&s;|ing be&s;towed upon the younger, could not be eternal &s;alvation. But, &amp;c.&mdash;Ergo.&mdash;</P>
<P>THAT to &s;erve, was to be the condition of the elder, is plain from the text above quoted, namely, Gen. xxv. 23. But this in &s;cripture never &s;ignifies to be eternally damned.&mdash;Therefore &amp;c.&mdash;</P>
<P>ARG. 4. If the election the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of in this chapter, excludes all works, and is of the mere will of GOD, it is not election to eternal life.</P>
<P>But &amp;c.&mdash;Ergo&mdash;</P>
<P>That the election &s;poke of in this chapter, excludes all works is evident from ver. 11.&mdash;That it is not election to eternal life is evident, becau&s;e eternal life is always in &s;cripture &s;aid to be of works, though not of works alone.</P>
<P>The argument therefore is conclu&s;ive.&mdash;</P>
<P>ARG. 5. If the election the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of in this chapter, took place fir&s;t in Abraham and his &s;eed, before his &s;eed were born; then in I&s;aac and his &s;eed before they were born; then in Jacob and his &s;eed, before they were born; it is not ab&s;olute election to eternal life.</P>

<P><PB N="21" REF="026990_0020_0FD2B4B983EC41D8">That the election the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of in this chap|ter, took place as above, needs no proof.&mdash;But the &s;crip|ture no where repre&s;ents eternal life, as be&s;towed upon any family, or race of men in this manner.</P>

<P>ARG. 6. If by ve&s;&s;els of mercy, the whole body of Jews and Gentiles, who were admitted into the kingdom of GOD under the Go&s;pel; is intended, and the whole body of unbelieving Jews intended, by the ve&s;&s;els of wrath fitted to de&s;truction: it is not ab&s;olute election to eternal life, that the Apo&s;tle treats of in this chapter.</P>

<P>That in this chapter the Apo&s;tle is arguing about the unbelieving nation or people of I&s;rael, and vindicating the truth, and ju&s;tice of GOD, in their rejection; will be allowed by all.

Behold therefore the goodne&s;s and &s;everity of GOD: on them which fell &s;e|verity; but towards thee goodne&s;s, if thou continue in his goodne&s;s: otherwi&s;e thou al&s;o &s;hall be cut off. Thus evident it is that the election the Apo&s;tle here &s;peaks of may be made void and come to nothing.</P>
<P>Therefore &amp;c.&mdash;</P>
<P>I think it now appears mo&s;t plain, that Mr. R. has wholly mi&s;taken the meaning of the Scriptures, he pre|tends to predicate his di&s;cour&s;e upon. And likewi&s;e, that what Mr. R. pretends to be the Apo&s;tles meaning, is &s;omething that lay quite wide of the &s;ubject the Apo&s;|tle was di&s;cu&s;&s;ing, and could not therefore come into his mind. The ground of Mr. R's mi&s;take is al&s;o evident, namely, his not con&s;idering the double character of the Deity; as &s;overeign benefactor and righteous judge; as has been briefly con&s;idered above. Mr. R's founda|tion being now wholly removed, his &s;uper&s;tructure mu&s;t fall to the ground. But as he has advanced &s;everal ar|guments to prove his opinion, &s;o very ill founded upon &s;cripture, or rea&s;on: which may be thought, by the le&s;s di&s;cerning, to have &s;ome weight in them, I &s;hall now as propo&s;ed proceed.</P>
<P N="4">4. To examine Mr. R's arguments, to evince and il|lu&s;trate what he calls an, "important doctrine."</P>
<P><Q>ARG. 1. GOD hath an original inalienable right and property in all things. Therefore it belongs to him&mdash;is his e&s;&s;ential prerogative to have mercy on whom he will, and to harden whom he will.</Q>
Let it be re|membered here, that according to Mr. R. eternal &s;alva|tion is connected with GOD's having mercy, and eternal
<PB N="23" REF="026990_0022_0FD2B4BB0421FBC0">
damnation with his hardening. So that the argument &s;tands thus, GOD hath an original inahenable right and property in all things; therefore it belongs to him to &s;ave whom he will and damn whom he will. The property of GOD in all things will be allowed by all. But &s;uch a u&s;e of it as Mr. R. makes is quite new. Holy Job comforts him&s;elf with the thought of his being the prop|erty of GOD: Job, xiv. 15, Thou wilt have a de&s;ire to the work of thine hands. And the P&s;almi&s;t grounds his plea for mercy on the property of GOD in him: P&s;al. cxix. 94. I am thine, &s;ave me. But Job and the P&s;almi&s;t lived before Mr. R. doctrine was known; they &s;uppo&s;ed that GOD's tender mercies were over all his works. But Mr. R. has di&s;covered, that free wrath makes as large, or much larger part of the divine character than free grace!</P>
<P>The ground of Mr. R's mi&s;take is manife&s;t, he did not con&s;ider, that &s;aving and damning, rewarding and pun|i&s;hing, belong not to GOD as &s;overeign Lord and pro|prietor; but as righteous lawgiver and judge. We al|low the premi&s;es, but deny his conclu&s;ion, as totally void of truth.</P>
<P><Q>ARG. 2. Ju&s;tice and mercy are e&s;&s;ential to the di|vine character, a character complete in all perfection. Therefore it belongs to GOD to have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and to harden whom he will har|den.</Q>
Reply, neither ju&s;tice, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mercy as it re&s;pects mi&s;ery, are exerci&s;ed or di&s;covered, by withholding or be&s;towing original favours but the&s;e only are given by the mere will, of GOD.

<P><Q>ARG. 3. GOD actually hath mercy on &s;ome, and hardneth others. Therefore it belongs to him to have mercy on whom he will and to harden whom he will.</Q>
Reply, both premi&s;es and conclu&s;ion are fal&s;e; for GOD never had mercy on any nor hardened any, in Mr. R's &s;en&s;e of having mercy and hardening. And his will is not the rule by which he proceeds, in &s;aving and damning

men; but his law The obedient &s;hall be rewarded bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the di&s;obedient &s;hall be puni&s;hed. But as Mr. R. ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> under this argument had recour&s;e to the in&s;tance of Pha|raoh, to prove that GOD hardneth &s;ome; I will, for the &s;ake of &s;ome who may be impo&s;ed upon, by the bare &s;ound of words, attend a little to the &s;cripture account of this matter. I have already ob&s;erved, that by hardening in Rom. ix. 18. We are to under&s;tand ruining.</P>
<P>We will now inquire, what GOD actually did to Pha|raoh, previous to his bringing ruin upon him. It is true, we are told by Mr. R. that GOD hardened his heart; and we read Exod. vii. 3, that GOD &s;aid unto Mo&s;es, I will harden Pharaoh's heart. Now if we turn to Exod. viii. 15, we &s;hall gain a ju&s;t notion in what manner GOD hardened his heart, for it is there written, But, when Pharaoh &s;aw there was re&s;pite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them, <HI>as the Lord had &s;aid.</HI> And again chap. ix. 34, 35, When Pharaoh &s;aw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were cea&s;ed, he &s;inned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his &s;ervants; and the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the people go; <HI>as the Lord had &s;poken by Mo&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>GOD had &s;aid, he would harden Pharaoh's heart, and Pharaoh is, in the&s;e two places, &s;aid to harden his own heart; <HI>as the Lord had &s;aid.</HI> Therefore what the Lord had &s;aid, is to be explained, by what is here &s;aid, (chap. ix. 34, 35) concerning the hardening of Pharaoh's heart. But it is here &s;aid that Pharaoh wickedly took occa&s;ion, from the re&s;pite, which GOD granted him, to harden his own heart. Con&s;equently all that GOD did, towards hardening his heart, was granting him re&s;pite, from one plague after another; which indeed, &s;hould have &s;often|ed his heart. GOD therefore, hardened his heart, only as what GOD did was by him wickedly made the occa&s;ion of hardening his own heart in di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>Our Lord tells us Mat. x. 34, 35, I came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d peace, but a &s;word; for I am come to &s;et a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> vari|ance again&s;t his father, &amp;c. Now what did Chri&s;t do, to de&s;troy the peace of the world, and the peace of fam|ilies? Why nothing but publi&s;h the glad tidings of &s;al|vation,
<PB N="25" REF="026990_0024_0FD2B4C2003AC2F8">
and &s;et up his peaceable kingdom in the world. Neither did GOD do any thing to harden Pharaoh's heart, but what &s;hould, and would have &s;oftened it, had it not been his own fault.</P>
<P><Q>ARG. 4. The potte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hath power over the clay, of the &s;ame lump to make one ve&s;&s;el unto honor, and another to di&s;honor. Therefore it belongs to GOD to have mercy on whom he will, and to harden whom he will.</Q>
Reply, I deny the conclu&s;ion; for rewarding and puni&s;hing belong not to creating will and power, but to remunerative ju&s;tice. GOD may without any inju&s;tice, make one ve&s;&s;el more honorable than another; give five talents to one and but two to another, according to his own &s;overeign plea&s;ure. But his own plea&s;ure is not the rule, by which he will proceed, in rewarding and puni|&s;hing, but the improvement, or the mi&s;improvement of the talents freely given to each one, to occupy withal. The parable of the potter, Mr. R. calls an
<Q>illuminating proof &s;ugge&s;ted by Paul him&s;elf.</Q>
It is true, it was a good proof, and quite applicable to the &s;ubject St. Paul was upon, in the 9th chap. to the Romans, namely GOD's giving, or refu&s;ing to give, certain privileges in this life. But Mr. R's &s;ubject, is quite different from the Apo&s;tles, as it &s;olely re&s;pects the di&s;tributions of the life to come; a &s;ubject totally foreign to the Apo&s;tles in the 9th of Romans. The parable of the potter is, therefore totally mi&s;applied by Mr. R. and &s;o likewi&s;e the words he has taken from the prophet I&s;aiah; and fixed as a motto to his di&s;cour&s;e. I am &s;orry to &s;ee the &s;criptures perverted and abu&s;ed in &s;uch a manner, by means of men's mi&s;ta|king their true meaning.</P>
<P><Q>ARG. 5. Every po&s;&s;ible hypothe&s;is re&s;pecting the determination of the character, and di&s;po&s;al of the eter|nal &s;tate of men, except that which is re&s;olved into the wi&s;dom, and good plea&s;ure of the deity, is weak and in&s;ufficient if not impious and ab&s;urd. Therefore, it be|longs to GOD&mdash;is his e&s;&s;ential prerogative to have mer|cy on whom he will, and to harden whom he will har|den.</Q>
Reply, this argument is wholly fal&s;e; both premi&s;es and conclu&s;ion. I will attend upon Mr. R. in
<PB N="26" REF="026990_0025_0FD2B4868537F7D0">
his fruitle&s;s endeavour to &s;upport it. He begins, by blotting a little more than two pages, in a pretended &s;cuffle with men, angels, and devils, for no purpo&s;e that I can &s;ee, unle&s;s, to &s;how how ea&s;y a victory may be gain|ed, where there is none to oppo&s;e.</P>
<P>In page 34 he &s;ays,
<Q>In the la&s;t place, &s;hall we &s;ay this great affair is left to men them&s;elves? Each one is to determine and a&s;certain his own character and eter|nal &s;tate? This indeed is not merely &s;uppo&s;ed: but a&s;|&s;erted, as &s;trenou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted upon by many. It is not as GOD wills and di&s;po&s;es; but as men them&s;elves will and order. There are who &s;ay, men &s;hall be ble&s;t as far as man permits; a nature rational implies the pow|er of being ble&s;t or wretched as we plea&s;e; Heaven wills our happine&s;s, allows our doom; Heaven but per|&s;uades, almighty man decrees; man is the maker of immortal fates.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If this &s;uppo&s;ition &s;hould fail; I apprehend it will be allowed that every other hypothe&s;is mu&s;t be given up. Concerning what is now before us, it may be proper to mention &s;everal things and proceed by &s;teps.</Q>
I will attend to the things which Mr. R. mentions, and the &s;teps by which he proceeds; to prove that it is not left to every man to determine his own character and eternal &s;tate. And then, prove the contrary.</P>
<P>Mr. R. proceeds,
<Q>It may be granted, that it was re|ferred to Adam (as far as any &s;uch thing could be re|ferred to a creature) to determine his own, and the character and &s;tate of his po&s;terity.</Q>
And again he &s;ays,
<Q>It may be granted; that in a low qualified &s;en&s;e it was referred to Adam to determine his own, and the char|acter and &s;tate of his po&s;terity, p. 35.</Q>
In p. 28 Mr. R. tells us,
<Q>That the determination of the character, and di&s;po&s;al of the &s;tate and circum&s;tances of creatures, par|ticularly the eternal &s;tate of men, is GOD's peculiar pro|vince, and e&s;&s;ential prerogative. That it belongs to him originally and independently; is what he cannot be dive&s;ted of by any; and indeed is that of which he cannot dive&s;t him&s;elf; it being e&s;&s;ential as ab&s;olute per|fection, involving ju&s;tice and mercy, is e&s;&s;ential, and
<PB N="27" REF="026990_0026_0FD2B4C4329EF818">
the denial of it, infering the denial of divine exi&s;tence&middot;</Q>
Is it po&s;&s;ible for Mr. R. to reconcile the 28 and 35 pages, in his di&s;cour&s;e? Will the&s;e &s;aving words,
<Q>As far as any &s;uch thing can be referred to a creature,</Q>
or,
<Q>In a low qualified &s;en&s;e.</Q>
Save him from an open contradiction? e&s;pecially when according to him, it was granted to Adam, not only to determine his own &s;tate, but the &s;tate of his po&s;terity; which if true, does not look as if he had it in a 'low qualified &s;en&s;e.' It is much more than I claim for any other man, or believe that Adam ever had. And how Mr. R. will reconcile &s;uch an exten&s;ive grant, to the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of GOD, I know not.</P>
<P>Mr. R. &s;ays, that in a low qualified &s;en&s;e it was refer|red to Adam, &amp;c; and then adds,
<Q>And we well know the i&s;&s;ue of that trial was &s;in and ruin.</Q>
It is evident now from Mr. R's own acknowledgement; that this in|communicable prerogative of Deity, which Deity cannot dive&s;t him&s;elf of, without denying his own exi&s;tence; was actually &s;o transferred to Adam, as that he by the trial, determined his own character, to be that of a &s;in|ner, and his condition to be ruinous. And as it mu&s;t be cruel in his maker, to give him power only to de&s;troy him&s;elf; and withhold from him power to &s;ave him&s;elf; we may fairly conclude, that he had, full and complete power given him, by his maker; to be happy or mi&s;er|able according as he &s;hould choo&s;e.</P>
<P>It is very unlucky for Mr. R. that at his fir&s;t &s;etting out to di&s;prove a quotation from Dr. Young, he &s;hould by his own acknowledgment, &s;o fully prove it. Men &s;hall be ble&s;t as far as man permits; a nature rational implies the power of being ble&s;t or wretched as we plea&s;e. We have now Mr. R's te&s;timony to the truth of the&s;e lines. Great is the truth and will prevail! But we may not leave Mr. R's fir&s;t &s;tep yet, there is one thing further, which demands our notice; namely, what Mr. R. &s;ays of Adam, after allowing, that it was referred to him, to determine his own character, &amp;c. he adds,
<Q>It is certain, however, that Adam had not that liberty of indifference, that &s;elf determining power, that power of originating volitions, which is urged by many as being e&s;&s;ential to
<PB N="28" REF="026990_0027_0FD2B4884C7C3290">
moral agency, and nece&s;&s;ary to render the volitions and actions of men worthy of prai&s;e or blame. Be|cau&s;e &s;uch power and liberty is no where to be found, in men, Angels or the Deity; the very notion being ab|&s;urd.</Q>
Reply, Who determined Adams will to eat the forbidden fruit? If he did not determine it him&s;elf he is mo&s;t unju&s;tly charged with &s;in. If he did determine it him&s;elf, he had a &s;elf determining power. Is it indeed ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that Deity has a &s;elf determining power? I verily thought all who, believe there is a GOD; would al|low him &s;uch a power. For if he be the fir&s;t cau&s;e, how can his volitions, be determined by any cau&s;e antecedent or ex|trin&s;ic to him&s;elf? and of divine volitions, are not deter|minmined by an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e, as they cannot be in the fir&s;t cau&s;e; then Deity; if he be the fir&s;t cau&s;e, has a &s;elf detering power. And this power GOD has given to me, and every other man; by which I and all other men, deter|mine our own volitions, i. e. we our&s;elves will, or choo&s;e, we are agents in choo&s;ing, and not mere pa&s;&s;ive beings. On &s;econd thought, Mr. R. may think be&s;t to allow a &s;elf determining power in the Deity. And I do now tell him, that I claim this power for my&s;elf, in common, with all other men; and &s;hall do &s;o, until he &s;hall prove it an incommunicable attribute in the Deity; and when ever he &s;hall do that, I &s;hall be quite able to prove, that there is no &s;econd being that is an agent. I come now to take notice of Mr. R's &s;econd &s;tep.</P>

<Q>The work of redemption by CHRIST hath open|ed the way to prevent the de&s;truction of the human-kind. But it is ever to be remembered, that the work Chri&s;t fini&s;hed on the cro&s;s, in it &s;elf con&s;idered, doth make no alteration in the &s;tate of mens minds.</Q>

Mr. R. &s;ays,
<Q>The bias of their minds while unre|generated is only in favour of &s;in.</Q>
Reply, by unre|generate,
<PB N="29" REF="026990_0028_0FD2B4C5883E90B0">
I &s;uppo&s;e Mr. R. means men in their natural &s;tate; and would be under&s;tood to affirm with regard to all &s;uch, that the
<Q>bias of their minds is only in favour of &s;in.</Q>
But what is this, but to &s;lander human na|ture? Will Mr. R. &s;ay, that there are in the nature of man principles of &s;in? It &s;o, they mu&s;t be created in and with our nature by GOD; or the production of &s;ome evil being, who is in part the author of our nature; which is no other than the Manichean mi&s;take. How contrary is Mr. R's proportion now under con&s;ideration, to St. Paul's doctrine, Romans ii. 14, 15. For when the Gentiles which have not the law, do by nature the thing contained in the law, the&s;e having not the law, are a law unto them|&s;elves: which &s;hew the work of the law written in their hearts, their con&s;cience al&s;o bearing witne&s;s, and their thoughts the mean while accu&s;ing, or el&s;e excu&s;ing one another. Here the Apo&s;tle &s;hows, 1. That tho&s;e who are without the written law, have a law written in their hearts, which is a &s;elf law, or rule of action to them. 2. That this &s;elf law, agrees with tho&s;e things, written in the law of GOD; &s;o that men naturally do the things contained in the law. The &s;park of rea&s;on in man, &s;how|ing the &s;ame light, in its narrow &s;phere, as the immen&s;e ocean of intelligence in the father of Lights; the mind of man naturally harmonizing with the mind and will of GOD. The Apo&s;tle demon&s;trates this by three argu|ments, 1. The virtuous actions of &s;ome heathen, who have no guide but nature, prove, that by nature they know what is right. 2. The force of con&s;cience in them, &s;ecret|ly reproaching them, for their wicked actions. 3. Their debates among them&s;elves, and mutual accu&s;ations, or vindications of their conduct. Mr. R. &s;ays of natural men, "The bias of their minds is only in favour of &s;in." St. Paul &s;ays they do by nature the things contained in the law. I prefer St. Pauls account of human naure, to Mr R's. Mr. R. adds, certainly it is not in favour of holine&s;s. "By holine&s;s I &s;uppo&s;e Mr. R. means obedi|ence to GOD's Law. Now, St. Paul &s;ays, in the text we have been con&s;idering, that man do by nature the things contained in the law. How then, can Mr. R.
<PB N="30" REF="026990_0029_0FD2B494D7F387E0">
be certain, that mens minds naturally are not in favour of holine&s;s? The law is holy, and men do by nature the duties it requires. Why his rea&s;on for this follows, in the&s;e words,
<Q>For then there would be no need of be|ing born again. And our Saviour did not preach and inculcate the truth when he &s;aid, except a man be born again he cannot &s;ee the Kingdom of GOD.</Q>
Reply, by being born again, I &s;uppo&s;e Mr. R. means what i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> commonly called conver&s;ion, or a means being turned or turning from &s;in to holine&s;s. And if &s;o; I would a&s;k how our Saviour's making this a nece&s;&s;ary qualifica|tion for heaven obliges us to believe, that the minds of unconverted men are only in favour of &s;in: and certain that they are not in favour of holine&s;s? He that came to our Lord to be taught the way to eternal life, when directed to keep the commandments, could &s;ay all the&s;e have I kept. Je&s;us beholding him loved him, Mark x. 17&mdash;21. It is true, Chri&s;t tells him, that he lacked one thing; but &s;urely he did not lack every thing.</P>
<P>I think it very rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that the minds of tho&s;e born in chri&s;tian countries, and favoured with a religious education; from their youth up, are aver&s;e to the ways of &s;in in general, and in favour of holine&s;s. And yet they may need conver&s;ion from &s;ome one way of &s;in in order to their entering into the kingdom of GOD. Mr. R. concludes that,
<Q>Were the deci&s;ion, left to men them&s;elves, as the ca&s;e now &s;tands&mdash;the con&s;equence would be no &s;alvation: but de&s;truction to the whole race: notwith&s;tanding what Chri&s;t hath done.</Q>
Reply, tho&s;e who believe this conclu&s;ion, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily look upon all concern about their eternal &s;tate; as meddling with what belongs not to them. If Mr. R's &s;cheme is right, all in&s;trumental religion is but a farce. What can more effectually de&s;troy religion, than &s;uch a con|clu&s;ion, believed and practi&s;ed upon? But when it is &s;een, that flander and mi&s;repre&s;entation, are the grounds on which it &s;tands, 'tis hoped that it will not have weight with any.</P>

<P>Reply, I will a little examine Mr. R's notion of &s;u|pernatural influence, and then enquire how the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of this &s;uppo&s;ed influence, makes it uncertain with GOD whether any among men would comply with the propo|&s;als of the go&s;pel, and be &s;aved.</P>

And the term man, I think conveys an idea of a body fitly organized and formed as our bodies in the general are, and that this body is actuated by a mind, who&s;e principle faculties are intelligence and activity. Intelligence, by which it it capable of thinking or ta|king in ideas, of reflecting upon things pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, of to come; according as it has received information from abroad, and of looking into the nature and the con&s;e|quences of things, and &s;o forming a judgement of the fit|ne&s;s or unfitne&s;s of actions; and a faculty power of &s;elf-motion or action, by which it moves and directs the body in that way, and to &s;erve &s;uch purpo&s;es, as it intends. And as this is an idea, which I &s;uppo&s;e, is fixed to the term man; and ari&s;es from the human compo&s;ition; &s;o that compo&s;ition is the effect or produce of nature, and not of any &s;upernatural influence, which operates above, or contrary to tho&s;e laws. And as man is thus natural|ly compounded, is he is hereby con&s;tituted a moral agent, i. e. he by his natural compo&s;ition, has power or is at liberty for the choo&s;ing or refu&s;ing, for the doing or avoiding, either good or evil; and, as &s;uch he is ac|countable for his actions, being capable of approving or di&s;approving him&s;elf to GOD his maker; in the u&s;e of tho&s;e talents committed to his tru&s;t.</P>
<P>Now as man is naturally thus fitted for actions, for what does he need &s;upernatural influence? Will any &s;ay that &s;upernatural influence is nece&s;&s;ary, to enable man to perform the duty which GOD requires of him. I an&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1. This is to reflect, and mo&s;t &s;everely cen&s;ure the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of GOD, in giving laws to his creatures.</P>

<P>Men do good generally by their natural ability, with out any &s;uch co-opperation of GOD. And let it be re+membered here, that if GOD does co opperate with ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at any time, yet this does not add to the virtue or good+ne&s;s of the being he co-operates with; becau&s;e the virtu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> or goodne&s;s of any agent ari&s;es from the right exerci&s;e o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;uch power, as is exerted by his own will and agency an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not in the exerci&s;e of &s;uch power as is exerted by the wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and agency of another. If it &s;hould be urged, that, by &s;u|pernatural influence, man does not receive any new abili|ty, &s;trictly &s;peaking; but he receives a di&s;po&s;ition, to make a right u&s;e of the ability that he has, which di&s;po|&s;ition, he would not have, without a divine &s;upernatural influence; but would be di&s;po&s;ed to the contrary. I an|&s;wer, the &s;trength of this objection lies in the improper u&s;e of the word di&s;po&s;ition; and in order to remove it I would ob&s;erve, that we have before &s;hown, that intelli|gence and activity are nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute a moral agent. And as motive, which takes place in the under|&s;tanding, and which is the product of intelligence, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> nece&s;&s;ary to action, becau&s;e the active faculty will not be exerted, without &s;ome previous rea&s;on to di&s;po&s;e the mind to action: hence it appears, that, when a man is &s;aid to be di&s;po&s;ed, to one action rather than another, nothing is intended thereby but the prevaling influence, that one motive has upon a man to produce action, above what all others have to produce the contrary. For a motive is the ground and rea&s;on of action, &s;o the motive that prevails di&s;po&s;es the agent to act. And every mo|tive is what it is in its &s;elf, either good or evil, antece|dent to, and independent of any divine determination concerning them. When therefore, it is &s;aid that man
<PB N="35" REF="026990_0034_0FD2B4D3C4AC1F08">
cannot make a right u&s;e of his ability, except GOD by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;upernatural influence gives him a di&s;po&s;ition; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erm di&s;po&s;ition, mu&s;t &s;ignify either, 1 The giving a power to di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt one motive and another, and &s;o to judge of their moral fitne&s;s or unfitne&s;s; or a A power to act from right motives, when &s;uch are pre|&s;ent to the mind: or 3 The pre&s;enting &s;uch motives to the mind, as are nece&s;&s;ary to excite to right action.</P>
<P>Now if by a di&s;po&s;ition is meant either of the two fir&s;t, it is fal&s;e to &s;ay, that man would not have a di&s;po&s;ition to make a right u&s;e of the ability he has without &s;uper|natural influence, becau&s;e what is here &s;uppo&s;ed to be given by &s;upernatural influence, is what man has by his natural compo&s;ition; and that by which he is con&s;tituted a moral agent, as I have &s;hown above. Take away the&s;e powers or either of them, and men are no more &s;ub|jects of moral government, or accountable for their ac|tions, than the bea&s;ts of the field. But if by giving a di&s;po&s;ition is meant the pre&s;enting &s;uch motives to the mind, as are nece&s;&s;ary to excite to right action, and that &s;uch action cannot take place, except tho&s;e motives are thus pre&s;ented. Then I an&s;wer, it is true that a good and virtuous action cannot take place without a proper motive to excite to it, and that GOD may, and I believe often does, kindly interpo&s;e, and by his holy &s;pirit, pre|&s;ent proper motives to the mind, which motives &s;o pre|&s;ented, become the ground and rea&s;on of good action of|ten times. But then it is to be remembered,</P>
<P N="1">1. That &s;uch an interpo&s;ition, of the father of &s;pirits to a&s;&s;i&s;t our minds, is not, always nece&s;&s;ary to right action, becau&s;e the fitne&s;s or unfitne&s;s of our actions in general, is plain to be &s;een, without &s;uch help.</P>
<P N="2">2. When GOD does at any time interpo&s;e and by his holy &s;pirit pre&s;ent motives to the mind, this divine op|peration, is not the phy&s;ical, nor the moral cau&s;e of the right action that follows. For as the fitne&s;s of the action ari&s;es from the nature of things; &s;o our &s;eeing that fitne&s;s, and acting agreeable to it, is no other than the exerci&s;e of that ability, which ari&s;es from our natural compo&s;ition; and all that GOD does is only in&s;trumentally making that
<PB N="36" REF="026990_0035_0FD2B49C97BD35A0">
motive pre&s;ent to the mind, which is the excitement t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> right action: which motive might have been pre&s;ente<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ome other way, and if it had, it would have produced the &s;ame action. So that, &s;trictly &s;peaking GOD never gives any di&s;po&s;ition at all but 'tis wholly by the exerci&s;e of men's natural powers that they are di&s;po&s;ed this way or that.</P>
<P>Furthermore, &s;hould any &s;ay, that though man, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his natural capacity, is an agent, yet his agency is con|fined to things natural and rational; but as to things &s;piritual, he has no agency, until by a &s;upernatural influ|ence, he is put into a capacity therefor. This I &s;uppo&s;e is Mr. R's real &s;entiment, if I can under&s;tand him; and in &s;everal parts of his di&s;cour&s;e, more or le&s;s clearly ex|pre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>See p. 18 and 19,
<Q>In regeneration and &s;anctification the &s;criptures a&s;cribe a peculiar interpo&s;ition and influ|ence to God.&mdash;According to &s;criptural repre&s;entation there &s;eemeth to be a peculiar, and what hath been cal|led &s;upernatural influence, in producing holy pecep|tions and volitions, which influence is over and above the general influence&mdash;extrin&s;ic exertion, nece&s;&s;ary to prepare the way for perceptions and volitions, to take place in creatures, i. e. to enable them to under&s;tand and choo&s;e.&mdash;Sinful exerci&s;es may be conceived of as taking place, without any other kind of influence&mdash;ex|trin&s;ic exertion, than what is nece&s;&s;ary to enable men to under&s;tand choo&s;e and act.</Q></P>
<P>If I under&s;tand Mr. R. he means to hold forth, that over and above that general influence of GOD, by which all men are able to under&s;tand, choo&s;e and act; there is a &s;pecial, peculiar, &s;upernatural influence nece&s;&s;ary, in order to men's converting from &s;in, or becoming holy. By a general influence men can under&s;tand choo&s;e and act; as Mr. R. tells us; but they can only under&s;tand, choo&s;e and act in the common affairs of life. He doth not mean to extend this power, to religious, holy ac|tions; for with regard to the&s;e he tells us, that &s;uper|natural influence is nece&s;&s;ary to produce them. So that I think it is plain, that Mr. R. con&s;iders the agency of
<PB N="37" REF="026990_0036_0FD2B4D3C8036058">
a natural man to be confined, to things rational and nat|ural; but as to &s;piritual things men have no agency, un|til by a &s;upernatural influence they are put into a capaci|ty therefor. To this, I &s;hall in this place, only &s;ay, that if Mr. R. and others of his opinion are right, there mu&s;t be two &s;ets of powers in man, for the performance of good, one for temporal and the other for &s;piritual good. But, to me, this appears a mere fiction, both rea&s;on and &s;cripture agree, that it is by one &s;et of powers, namely, the human compo&s;ition, that we perform all good, whether it relates to this life or a better, and by which we plea&s;e either man or GOD. The &s;ame tongue with which we ble&s;s GOD, we cur&s;e men, out of the &s;ame mouth proceedeth ble&s;&s;ing and cur&s;ing, James iii. 9, 10. It is by the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion of fear, that men are lead to guard again&s;t the evils of this life, and of another.</P>
<P>It is the &s;ame natural pa&s;&s;ion of hope, which excites men to pro&s;ecute there pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s. It is by the &s;ame natural power, that a man loves GOD and his neighbour; which is the fulfilling of the law, and which will render him acceptable to his maker, and by which he loves any thing, that renders this life agree|able to him. Only the affection is exerci&s;ed on differ|en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> objects, and to a different degree, and it becomes either virtuous or vicious as it is exerci&s;ed upon a pro|per, or an improper object; or as it is kept within, or is indulged beyond its due bounds. It is the &s;ame nat|ural active faculty, or power of &s;elf-motion, by which a man u&s;es the members of his body, to commit murder or to &s;ave from death. The ca&s;e is the &s;ame with regard to all the parts of our compo&s;ition, and with regard to all the good which is performed by us.</P>
<P>And I do hereby call upon Mr. R. to give a ca&s;e, in which it will appear, that the natural man, has not abili|ty to perform any one branch of goodne&s;s, that will ren|der him acceptable to his maker. Our under&s;tandings may be enlightened, by truths brought to their view by the holy &s;pirit of GOD; which otherwi&s;e they might have remained ignorant of, or might not have attended to, and truth thus pre&s;ented, may become the ground or rea|&s;on
<PB N="38" REF="026990_0037_0FD2B4A4E748EA50">
of action. And if Mr. R. choo&s;es to call this by the name of &s;upernatural influence, I will not contend about words. Yet let it be remembered, that this does not in the lea&s;t affect our liberty, nor give us any new agency. But man is ju&s;t the &s;ame nature he was before, in that re&s;pect: his actions are performed in the &s;ame way, by the &s;ame natural faculties of intelligence and ac|tivity, as they were, antecedent to that illumination. How different &s;oever the ways are, by which man's un|der&s;tanding receives information, the faculty remains the &s;ame, being no more than a natural faculty. And if ac|tion follows a judgement, made up by means of truth &s;ugge&s;ted by the holy &s;pirit; that action is performed by men's natural faculty or power of &s;elf motion, exerted and directed by his intellectual faculty.</P>
<P>Thus I have a little examined Mr. R's. notion of &s;uper|natural influence, and to it appears a mere fiction: As it mu&s;t, I think be evident to every di&s;cerning per&s;on, that it is by man's natural agency, he performs all the actions which are performed by him. And if he is ever, by another made an in&s;trument, in matters wherein he has no agency, or that are above his agency, he is cer|tainly nothing the better for that; there being nothing of the nature of virtue in it.</P>
<P N="2">2. I come as propo&s;ed to enquire, how the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of this &s;uppo&s;ed &s;upernatural influence, makes it uncer|tain with God, whether any among men would comply with the propo&s;als of the go&s;pel and be &s;aved. Were it uncertain only with men, there would be no inconven|lency in it; as it would be equally uncertain, whether any one would fail of a compliance and &s;alvation. But if it be as Mr. R. &s;ays, an event which God him&s;elf could not know beforehand; God's plan is vague and uncertain.</P>
<P>Mr. R. tells us p. 37.
<Q>It is no limitation of divine knowledge to &s;ay, GOD cannot know that which is un|knowable.</Q>
But how does it appear, that, it is a thing unknowable how men under the go&s;pel will choo&s;e and act, without &s;upernatural influence to a&s;&s;i&s;t them? Mr. R. has offered no evidence of this, only &s;aying,
<PB N="39" REF="026990_0038_0FD2B4D551273088">
"It mu&s;t be uncertain," which is far from being &s;atisfac|tory to me. Is it not true, that the knowledge of the Deity is uncreated, underived, &s;elf exi&s;ting, independ|ant of any cau&s;e or medium whatever; e&s;&s;ential to the very exi&s;tence of Deity, and nece&s;&s;arily implied in the very idea of GOD; who by one &s;imple eternal act of his under&s;tanding, knows all things that have been, that are, that ever will be, and that never will be.</P>
<P>It is evident to me, that Mr. R. &s;uppo&s;es that GOD cannot know things properly contingent, that may or may not be, for ought that he hath decreed about them. Such as the choice, and actions of voluntary agents. And this fal&s;e notion has doubtle&s;s mi&s;led him. If the above definition of the divine knowledge is ju&s;t; his mi&s;take is thereby detected. But as this is a matter of the greate&s;t importance, I will take it up a little more largely. And the contingency of &s;ome events in re&s;pect of GOD, may be proved thus; GOD hath decreed, that all his creaturs &s;hould ordinarily work according to their &s;everal kinds and endowments, by which he in the creation di&s;tingui&s;h|ed them. For illu&s;tration, they may be ranked into three &s;everal forms. In the lowe&s;t &s;tand the mere natural a|gents, inanimate and &s;en&s;ele&s;s creatures. To the&s;e God hath given certain in&s;tincts and inclinations, by which they are determinately &s;wayed to the&s;e or tho&s;e certain ef|fects and operations, unle&s;s they are outwardly hinder|ed; for heavy bodies cannot choo&s;e but defend, fire can|not choo&s;e but burne.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd &s;tand the &s;en&s;itive creatures, bea&s;ts, &s;owls, fi&s;hes, &amp;c. to the&s;e GOD hath given &s;en&s;e and knowledge to di&s;cern what is good for their nature, and what is bad; and among many goods, to prefer that which is be&s;t, he hath given them al&s;o a free appetite, or a kind of &s;en&s;itive will, by which they may either freely pro&s;ecute, or avoid, &s;uch objects as they like or di&s;like; not determinately tied to this or that operation, as the other were. A &s;tone cannot but de&s;cend, but a bea&s;t may as well go up hill as down. In the upper form are men, rea&s;onable crea|tures, whom GOD hath made more voluntary than the other, by giving them greater freedom of choice, and pre|&s;enting
<PB N="40" REF="026990_0039_0FD2B4A4EB936928">
unto their more elevated knowledge, a greater variety of objects. Now, without doubt, GOD has di&s;|tingui&s;hed his creatures in abilities and faculties, that they might operate in their &s;everal kinds; that the natu|ral agents might work naturally, the voluntary, volun|tarily. The truth of this I think no man will deny ex|plicitly; but &s;ee the con&s;equence which follows mo&s;t un|deniably.</P>
<P>If GOD hath decreed, that many things &s;hould be done voluntarily by his creatures; then hath he decreed that many things &s;hould be done contingently in re&s;pect of him: but the fir&s;t is granted, therefore the &s;econd mu&s;t. The connexion I prove thus. All things are done con|tingently in re&s;pect of GOD, which for ought he hath de|creed, might with as much po&s;&s;ibility not be as be. But all things which are done by the creatures voluntarily, may as well not be done as done: therefore, if he hath decreed, that many things &s;hall be done voluntarily, he hath al&s;o decreed, that they &s;hould be done contingently. The minor is evident; becau&s;e if the creatures may not as well omit them as do them, they do them not voluntarily, but nece&s;&s;arily. Hence we &s;ee, that contingency is nece&s;&s;ary in re&s;pect of GOD's will, who will have many things done voluntarily; otherwi&s;e he would never have given his creatures wills. Now to &s;ay, that GOD cannot know things that are contingent, that may be, or may not be, according to the will of the creature; is the &s;ame as to &s;ay, that GOD's knowledge is but finite. For infinity of Knowledge mu&s;t re&s;pect either the number of objects, or the manner of comprehending them. But as no number can be infinite, &s;ince it may be doubled and trebled: knowledge in this re&s;pect can be but finite. But when we believe, that GOD from eternity decreed that volun|tary agents &s;hould have liberty to do, or not to do, and after what manner they plea&s;ed; &s;o that for any nece&s;&s;ity impo&s;ed upon their actions by him, what&s;oever they omit was as po&s;&s;ible to be done, as what they did &mdash; And yet from eternity knowing what&s;oever his creatures would do, or not do, his knowledge mu&s;t be infinite, and mo&s;t admirable. Infinite, not in re&s;pect of the number of ob|jects,
<PB N="41" REF="026990_0040_0FD2B4D6D6EC5CC8">
for &s;o no knowledge can be: but in re&s;pect of the boundle&s;s manner of actual comprehending tho&s;e things with an infallible fore-&s;ight, which in re&s;pect of GOD were contingent, their not being as po&s;&s;ible as their being. This is the royal prerogative of divine knowledge: and hence in the 41&s;t of I&s;aiah, GOD upbraideth the Pagan deities with this privilege peculiar to him&s;elf.&mdash;From what has been ob&s;erved, is it not apparent, that there is no previous or antecedent certainty in the things them|&s;elves, upon which the divine pre&s;cience is founded.&mdash; This &s;hows us the weakne&s;s and fallacy of Mr. R's rea|&s;oning, when he &s;ays, as in p. 37,
<Q>If there is no cer|tainty who &s;hall, and who &s;hall not be &s;aved, it can|not be known who &s;hall &s;hare the &s;aving effects of di|vine mercy, becau&s;e the previous certainty of an event, is imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed in the knowledge, or fore knowledge of the event.</Q></P>
<P>By certainty here, Mr. R. mu&s;t mean &s;ome medium di&s;tinct from the event, and by which it is made known. But had Mr. R. con&s;idered, that the knowledge of the Deity is an e&s;&s;ential attribute; independent of his decree, or any other act of his own, much le&s;s the actions of any finite or created being, he would never have rea&s;oned thus. I would a&s;k Mr. R. how the Saviour knew, that Sodom would have remained to his day, if the mighty works had been done in it, which were done in Capernaum? Will he &s;ay, the event was certain previous to its being known! It is very evident to me, that Mr. R. does not con&s;ider the difference between the knowledge of Deity, and our knowledge. It is readily granted, that &s;uch finite im|perfect creatures as we are, cannot po&s;&s;ibly know that any future event will certainly take place, unle&s;s it be nece&s;&s;arily connected with &s;omething that has a pre&s;ent exi&s;tence; for all we know, mu&s;t either be &s;elf evident, or evident by proof, i. e. It mu&s;t be connected with &s;ome cau&s;e or medium known to us at pre&s;ent, from which we can with certainty infer its future exi&s;tance. Our knowledge is thus limited and confined, becau&s;e wholly <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">b extra.</HI> We having no innate &s;tock of knowledge. But if Deity cannot know things, but only in this way,
<PB N="42" REF="026990_0041_0FD2B4A6CC626130">
how came he by the idea of po&s;&s;ible exi&s;tence? Upon the whole it now fully appears, that Mr. R. is greatly mi&s;|taken, in &s;aying, "GOD could not know what would be the event of things in the &s;y&s;tem." Upon the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of &s;upernatural influence. All therefore, that he infers from hence about the plan of GOD, as vague and full of uncertainty, is without the lea&s;t foundation. Thus I have followed Mr. R. four &s;teps, without geting any near|er, the point he &s;et out for.</P>
<P>His 5th and 6th &s;teps, have not &s;o much as the &s;hadow of an argument in them, being wholly recapitulatory, and anticipating a conclu&s;ion, from premi&s;es that are doubtful, not to &s;ay openly fal&s;e. His 7th &s;tep is in|troduced thus, p. 38.</P>
<P N="7"><Q>7. This dilemma is unavoidable. Either the Deity hath no will, no plea&s;ure re&s;pecting the &s;alvation, and damnation of the individuals of the human race, or his coun&s;el doth not &s;tand; unle&s;s it be true that he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and hardeneth whom he will, as fully and definitively as hath been mentioned.</Q>
Reply, GOD hath a will and plea&s;ure re|&s;pecting the &s;alvation and damnation of men, and has re|vealed and publi&s;hed it in his word; namely, that the righteous &s;hall be rewarded, and the wicked puni&s;hed: for he will render to every man according to his works. Which revelation, of GOD, is openly contrary to the &s;entiment advanced by you, and if true yours mu&s;t be fal&s;e. Now Sir, what becomes of your <HI>Crocodilinus</HI>? But it &s;eems you were aware of the weakne&s;s of your di|lemma; for a little below you &s;ay,
<Q>And for any to urge, that the divine will is conditional. There is nothing definititvely fixed in the divine mind re&s;pecting the in|dividuals that &s;hall be &s;aved, or that &s;hall peri&s;h, only this in general: He is re&s;olved to have mercy on all that repent, and to harden and de&s;troy all tho&s;e who remain impenitent. And this being the &s;um of his will and coun&s;el: he not only hath a will in the matter; but his coun&s;el mu&s;t &s;tand, let it fall as it may with the individuals of the human race. I &s;ay to urge this, will afford no relief.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="026990_0042_0FD2B4D84A1D89E0">But pray why doth it not afford relief? Why doth it not de&s;troy your dilemma? You have a pretended rea|&s;on ready, we will attend to it.
<Q>Becau&s;e repentance is implied in GOD's having mercy on any in the &s;en&s;e of the text.</Q>
Reply, Unhappy for you Sir, that you had not known the meaning of your text, before you un|dertook to preach from it; and I fear it may be &s;o to &s;ome of your readers. But as I have fully proved, that the text has no &s;uch meaning as you give it; that it was what could never come into St. Paul's mind when he wrote it; as it lay quite wide of his &s;ubject: you mu&s;t look up &s;ome better rea&s;on in future, or people will think that the divine will may be conditional. Thus we have followed Mr. R. &s;even &s;teps, and are quite as far from the point, as when we &s;et out. His eighth and la&s;t &s;tep followeth.</P>
<P N="8"><Q>8. Therefore on the whole, &s;ince a denial that it be|longs to GOD &mdash; is his e&s;&s;ential prerogative, to have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and to harden whom he will; is &s;o full of weakne&s;s and ab&s;urdity. Since there are no other beings to whom it doth or can belong. And &s;ince the admi&s;&s;ion of this &s;ets GOD up|on the throne; &s;ubjecting the materals of the intellectu|al world, to his authority and will. And in fine leads us to &s;ee how his own, which are the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t ends, may be certainly and infallibly accompli&s;hed. We ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in a clear conviction, and full per&s;ua&s;ion of this great truth: that it belongs to GOD, is his e&s;&s;ential prerogative, to determine the character, and di&s;po&s;e of the eternal &s;tate of men; in holine&s;s, and &s;alvation; or in &s;in and damnation according to his own good plea&s;ure.</Q>
As here is no argument of|fered, I &s;hall reply by only &s;aying. Therefore on the whole, &s;ince we &s;ee a gentleman of fine learning, of good di&s;cerning, of mature age and judgement, devoted to &s;tudy and find out truth, and di&s;cover it for the benefit of others; and under the be&s;t advantages &s;o to do: &s;o compleatly baffled, in his endeavours to prove, that it does not belong to men, to determine their own &s;tate and condition in the world to come. We ought to be e&s;tab|li&s;hed
<PB N="44" REF="026990_0043_0FD2B4A8516EE018">
in a clear conviction, and full per&s;ua&s;ion, that this good Gentleman did really undertake a forlorn hope. And have our minds prepared to receive evidence to the contrary to which I &s;hall now proceed as propo&s;ed. I have attended Mr. R. in his &s;truggle, to prove that it does not belong to men, to determine their own charac|ter and &s;tate in the world to come; and find him whol|ly failing. But this is not to be wondered a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;ince what he undertook to prove is again&s;t both rea&s;on and &s;crip|ture; and renders them both wholly u&s;ele&s;s unto men as bound for eternity.</P>
<P>I will now undertake to prove the contrary; a ta&s;k I &s;hould not have thought of undertaking, had not Mr. R. denied it. But I am apprehen&s;ive of no difficulty, but what will ari&s;e to me, from the propo&s;itions being to near a kin to a &s;elf-evident one; that it may be difficult to find proof clearer than the thing to be proved. However I will try with Mr. R. help to &s;et this matter beyond di&s;pute. I am greatly obliged to Mr. R. for &s;aving me the trouble, of an enquiry into the liberties and privileges of the fir&s;t man; by freely acknowledging, that what he calls an e&s;&s;ential prerogative of Deity; and what Deity could not dive&s;t him&s;elf of, was actually transfered to him; and that in a more full, ample and exten&s;ive man|ner, than I could de&s;ire.</P>
<P>Now that it does belong to men them&s;elves to deter|mine their own character and eternal &s;tate; I offer the following arguments as proof.</P>
<P>ARGUMENT 1. If the divine favour and acceptance depends wholly upon what men do: It belongs to them to determine their own character and eternal &s;tate. But the divine favour and acceptance depends wholly on what men do&mdash;Ergo&mdash;</P>
<P>Mr. R. has made it unnece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;ay any thing about the fir&s;t man; but if we may receive for truth what Mo&s;es has related, concerning GOD's treatment of the &s;econd man, my argument is fully e&s;tabli&s;hed, from one &s;ingle text of &s;cripture; namely, that in Gen. iv. 7, If thou doe&s;t well, &s;hall thou not be accepted? and if thou doe&s;t not well, &s;in lieth at the door. The context tells
<PB N="45" REF="026990_0044_0FD2B4DC39890CB8">
us that Cain and Abel brought their offerings&mdash;That GOD had re&s;pect unto Abel and to his offering: but unto Cain, and to his offering he had no re&s;pect. This made Cain very angry, and his countenance fell, upon this therefore Almighty GOD conde&s;cends to rea&s;on with him as in the text.&mdash;Here the great GOD lays down the rule of judgment, that rule by which he would proceed in di&s;tributing rewards and puni&s;hments to men. And it is done in &s;uch a way as to &s;how that Cain was fully ac|quainted with this before, and knew well the terms of ac|ceptance with GOD; for it is put by way of que&s;tion, which is a pointed way of &s;peaking, and &s;uppo&s;e the ca&s;e to be quite plain. <HI>If thou doe&s;t well,</HI> i. e. If thou had'&s;t brought &s;uch an offering, as thy circum&s;tances enabled thee, and as might be ju&s;tly expected from thee; and with &s;uch a temper of mind, as thou mighte&s;t and ough|te&s;t to have done, and as thy brother did. <HI>Shoulde&s;t thou not be accepted?</HI> Yes, &s;urely, it would have been wrong, unju&s;t and unequal in me to have rejected thee and thy of|fering; and this thou doe&s;t fully know. <HI>And if thou doe&s;t not well,</HI> i. e. doe&s;t evil, when thou hade&s;t power and wa&s;t at liberty to do the contrary, <HI>Sin lieth at the door.</HI> Thou oughte&s;t in all rea&s;on to expect to reap the fruit of thy folly and wickedne&s;s; thy re&s;entment there|fore is mo&s;t unrea&s;onable.</P>
<P>I a&s;k now, why Almighty GOD made this difference between the&s;e two brothers and their offerings? The an|&s;wer mu&s;t be, becau&s;e one did well and the other ill. I therefore &s;ay, if we may receive for truth what Mo&s;es has here related, it is certain that it did belong to Cain and Abel, to determine their own character and eternal &s;tate. And con&s;equently to the whole po&s;terity of Adam, to the end of the world. The divine favour depending wholly on the improvement men make of the talents committed to their tru&s;t; it belongs &s;olely to them to determine their eternal &s;tate.</P>
<P>ARG. 2. If GOD &s;ets life and death before men, and leaves it to them to choo&s;e either: it belongs to men to determine their own character and future &s;tate.</P>
<P>But &amp;c.&mdash;Ergo&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="026990_0045_0FD2B4A9C53538B0">If we may credit the writings called &s;acred, this argu|ment may be fully &s;upported from many pa&s;&s;ages in them; particularly Deut. xxx. 15, 16, See I have &s;et before thee this day life and good, and death and evil; in that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy GOD, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his &s;tatutes, and his judgments, that thou maye&s;t live. Ver&s;e 19, I call heaven and earth to record this day again&s;t you that I have &s;et before you life and death, ble&s;|&s;ing and cur&s;ing: therefore choo&s;e life that both thou and thy &s;eed may live.</P>
<P>ARG. 3. If GOD promi&s;es life to the righteous, and threateneth death to the wicked: it belongs to men to determine their own character and future &s;tate.</P>
<P>But &amp;c.&mdash;Ergo&mdash;</P>
<P>The &s;acred writings are full of promi&s;es to the righte|ous, and threatenings to the wicked. One in&s;tance may &s;uffice. See I&s;a. iii. 10, Say ye to the righteous it &s;hall be well with him&punc; for they &s;hall eat the fruit of their doings; v. 11, Woe unto the wicked; it &s;hall be ill with him, for the reward of his hands &s;hall be given him. But none can be righteous but by doing right, or wick|ed but by doing wrong. 1 John. iii. 7, He that doeth righteou&s;ne&s;s is righteous. It is men them&s;elves there|fore, that determine their own character and eternal &s;tate; and none other can do it for them.</P>
<P>ARG. 4. If GOD requires obedience of men, as a con|dition of his favour and eternal happine&s;s, it belongs to men to determine their own character and eternal &s;tate.</P>
<P>But &amp;c.&mdash;</P>
<P>The &s;acred writings a&s;&s;ure us that GOD does require obedience of men in order to happine&s;s. Acts xvii. 3. GOD now commandeth all men every where to repent. Rom. ii. 6, 7, 8, GOD will render to every man accor|ding to his deeds: to them, who, by patient continu|ance in well doing, eternal life; but unto them that do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, indigna|tion and wrath. Therefore it belongs to men to deter|mine their own character and eternal &s;tate.</P>
<P>ARG. 5. If men will be finally ju&s;tified, or condemned
<PB N="47" REF="026990_0046_0FD2B4E1A3F3EF08">
by their works, it belongs to men to determine their own character and eternal &s;tate.</P>
<P>But &amp;c.&mdash;Ergo&mdash;</P>
<P>If the draught and &s;cheme our Lord has given of the judgment of the great day, in Mat. xxv. 31&mdash;46 may be relied upon for truth my argument is fully &s;upported. I have founded all the&s;e arguments, upon &s;cripture; thinking it would be more agreeable to reading in gene|ral; as the &s;criptures are by mo&s;t people, in our coun|try, con&s;idered as a good hi&s;tory of divine revelation. But it is quite as ea&s;y to demon&s;trate from rea&s;on, with|out the aid of &s;cripture; that it belongs to men to deter|mine their own character and eternal &s;tate. That it is utterly unfit, yea, in the nature of things impo&s;&s;ible, that the character and &s;tate of men &s;hould be determined by any other than them&s;elves. As mu&s;t appear I think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> every one, that con&s;iders what is meant by the term man. I come as propo&s;ed, 5 To con&s;ider Mr. R's an&s;wers to objections again&s;t his doctrine.</P>
<P><Q>OBJ. 1. The preceeding repre&s;entation mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily be contrary to truth, and is really chargeable with bla&s;phemy: for it makes GOD the author of &s;in.</Q>
Mr. R. allows that if by author of &s;in,
<Q>is meant acting, loving &s;in, or being a &s;inner, to &s;ay that GOD is the author of &s;in would be full of bla&s;phemy. And any &s;cheme any &s;entiment fairly implying this, ought to be rejected with the greate&s;t abhorrence.</Q>
That the prece|ding repre&s;entation is contrary to truth I have proved already. That it is full of bla&s;phemy and ought to be rejected, according to Mr. R's own confe&s;&s;ion, I will now prove. By making it fully appear, that Mr. R's &s;cheme, does really make GOD the actor or doer of all &s;in. And that it does &s;o, all mu&s;t &s;ee, when they take into view the whole quantum of liberty that Mr. R. allows unto men. This we find in p. 43, 44.
<Q>Men are not machines, are not acted like machines when they are hardened in &s;in: for they are voluntary, they move and act of choice, whereas in a mere machine there is no volition. It is acted upon but doth not act, doth not put forth any exertion. There is then an e&s;&s;ential dif|ference.
<PB N="48" REF="026990_0047_0FD2B4E68564EF88">
A mere machine cannot exerci&s;e liberty, can|not be to blame, becau&s;e it has no de&s;ign, no volition. But GOD in hardening &s;inners doth not influence them in any &s;uch manner, as to prevent &s;in being their own act, or to prevent their acting of choice, and becau&s;e they act voluntarily, re&s;pecting that which is evil and and make the evil their own, they are to blame, are wholly without excu&s;e, &s;inners are not compelled to do wickedly, whatever extrin&s;ic influence there is in the production of volition it is not of the nature of com|pul&s;ion. For we mean by compul&s;ion, that power which effects a thing again&s;t or at lea&s;t without our will or con&s;ent. The mo&s;t hardened &s;inners are, to all in|tents moral agents and accountable becau&s;e they act freely.</Q></P>
<P>According to Mr. R. all the difference between men and machines, is, that men choo&s;e, or act of choice, but a mere machine does not. He tells us that men are not acted like a windmill, becau&s;e they act of choice, and the whole amount of liberty he allows men is liberty of choice; and becau&s;e they act voluntarily, he &s;ays, they are to all intents moral agents and accountable; and be|cau&s;e they choo&s;e that which is evil, he fixes blame upon them.</P>
<P>But are any &s;o blind as not to &s;ee that the bea&s;ts of the field, and the birds of the air, enjoy liberty in as full, complete, and ample a manner as men, according to Mr. R. for they will and choo&s;e what they do as really as men; and it may with as much truth, be &s;aid of them, as of men, that they do as they are plea&s;ed to do. That they act freely, voluntarily and with liberty. But I never &s;uppo&s;ed until I read Mr. R's di&s;cour&s;e, that they were accounted by any to be moral agents. But &s;uppo|&s;ed that they were con&s;idered as without blame, becau&s;e they had no power over their volitions. They being ef|fects produced in them by the operation of cau&s;es, not within their governing command. So likewi&s;e mad men, their actions are voluntary, they do nothing but in con|&s;equence of previous will and plea&s;ure; but who, except Mr. R. ever thought they were moral agents, and their
<PB N="49" REF="026990_0048_0FD2B4E429462980">
actions morally good or evil! Now what is the rea&s;on that men, 'till Mr. R. appeared in print, have thought &s;o differently of the actions of di&s;tracted men, and others who have the full u&s;e of their mental powers? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hy the true and only rea&s;on is, the former are hurried on to vo|lition by a wild impetuous, over which they have no power; but the latter have it in their power to re&s;train and govern their wills and choices.</P>
<P>We feel in our&s;elves, not only a power to will, but a power over our volitions; and &s;uch an one as enables us to direct, &s;u&s;pend, overrule, or put an intire &s;top to them: nor, unle&s;s we were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this dominion, could we be agents; however great liberty might be al|lowed us in bringing into event what we have previou&s;ly willed. It is e&s;&s;ential to free agency, and &s;uch a u&s;e of it as to make us capable of good or ill de&s;ert, that our volitions upon which our actions follow, &s;hould be with|in reach of our command. The plain truth is, &s;uch a power in men as will make them cau&s;es, real proper cau|&s;es of their volitions, and the effects con&s;equent upon them, is the grand &s;upporting pillar of the world con|&s;idered as moral. Take this away, and it at once falls into de&s;olation and utter ruin. If men's volitions, and their con&s;equent effects, are the re&s;ult of invariable ne|ce&s;&s;ity, in virtue of exterior cau&s;es &s;o inviolably connec|ted, as that they will and mu&s;t come to pa&s;s, the author of this connection, which, according to Mr. R. is GOD, is the only agent in out world, and the only efficient, and real author, of whatever has been, or &s;hall hereafter be brought into event; not excluding any of the mo&s;t complicated villanies that have been, or may be perpe|trated by any of the &s;ons of Adam.</P>
<P>Thus plain it is, that Mr. R's &s;cheme makes the ever glorious GOD, the actor of all &s;in and wickedne&s;s that ever was, or ever will be in our world. It is therefore according to his own acknowledgment, bla&s;phemous and ought to be rejected with the greate&s;t abhorrence.</P>
<P>Mr. R's &s;cheme makes it nece&s;&s;ary that GOD &s;hould &s;ome how or other, be the author of &s;in, and hence he labours this, to the utmo&s;t of his ability; and even quite

beyond his ability. In p. 41 he &s;ays,
<Q>Certainly, it is too much for any to &s;ay he (GOD) could not po&s;&s;ibly have prevented it.</Q>
Le&s;t &s;ome, le&s;s di&s;cerning, &s;hould be mi&s;led by this, and too ea&s;ily go into the opinion, that &s;in does belong to GOD's plan, is really agreeable to his dec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tive will, as Mr. R. &s;ays. I would in the fir&s;t place ob&s;erve. That moral evil as di&s;tingui&s;hed from natural, is e&s;&s;entially connected with free agency, in the beings upon whom this guilt is fa&s;tened. It's nature con&s;i&s;ts in wrong determinations, and di&s;orderly conduct, which yet are voluntary, and argue a wilful mi&s;application of moral and rational powers. Free agents therefore, them|&s;elves, and not GOD, are the &s;ole and proper authors of it. It takes ri&s;e intirely from them, and would never have been but for their corrupt choices, and voluntary perver&s;ion of faculties, which they might have employed to wi&s;e and good purpo&s;es. And &s;hall a production wholly owing to creatures, and which never could have exi&s;ted, had they not abu&s;ed their powers, be charged to the ever glorious GOD! How &s;urprizing, that it &s;hould ever enter into the heart of any man, that &s;in belongs to GOD's plan, is agreeable to his decretive and providen|tial will! Secondly, I would ob&s;erve, that &s;ince GOD is a being of infinite purity and holine&s;s, I think he mu&s;t have prevented &s;in if he could have done it. Yet let it be remembered that I have not &s;o much re&s;pect to a nat|ural, as to a moral ability; an ability invariably, guided, in all its exertions, by pre&s;ent wi&s;dom, and the rea&s;on and nature of things.</P>
<P>I think in this &s;en&s;e, it was not in the power of the great fir&s;t cau&s;e, to have prevented moral defection. If it was, why was it not done? and in what po&s;&s;ible way can the now prevention of it be reconciled with infinite holine&s;s and goodne&s;s? whereas if GOD could not pre|vent it, in con&s;i&s;tency with wife and fit conduct, it is a good rea&s;on why he did not do it. And this I verily be|lieve to be the ca&s;e; and therefore differ from Mr. R. as certain as he is, and think that it is not too much for us to &s;ay, that GOD could not po&s;&s;ibly prevent &s;in. I will give my rea&s;ons for differing from Mr. R. in this

point; and &s;ubmit them to the judicious. If GOD could prevent &s;in it mu&s;t be one of the&s;e ways, viz. Either by not giving free agents a place in the &s;cale of beings; or by making them &s;o perfect as to be incapable of any wrong conduct; or by interpo&s;ing at all times, as occa&s;ion might require, to hinder the mi&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of moral powers, in beings that po&s;&s;e&s;s them, either in a higher or lower de|gree.

If no free agents, there could be no virtue, in a word, there could be no &s;uch thing as moral government, without which, the riche&s;t di&s;plays of the mo&s;t amiable perfection could have no place in the creation. This con&s;idered, will it not be thought quite unfit that the ble&s;&s;ing of moral liberty &s;hould be withheld. As to the &s;econd, viz. by making free agents &s;o perfect as to be incapable of wrong conduct. But is not this im|po&s;&s;ible in the nature of things? As creatures with all their perfections, would yet be finite, and how intelligent moral beings that are finite &s;hould be wholly incapable of becoming faulty, in any kind, or degree, is beyond all conception, to me it appears rea&s;onable to think, that the infinitely perfect Being is the only one that can be ab&s;olutely impeccable. But &s;hould it be &s;uppo&s;ed na|turally po&s;&s;ible in con&s;i&s;tency with wi&s;e and fit conduct in the Deity? Perhaps thus &s;peaking it is not po&s;&s;ible. So far as our knowledge extends, it is certain, that in|tilligent moral beings are not when they fir&s;t come into exi&s;tance, either &s;o perfect or happy as they may be. But are &s;o formed as to be capable of progre&s;s, both in perfection and happine&s;s; which progre&s;s depends much
<PB N="52" REF="026990_0051_0FD2B4E8213B33C0">
on the u&s;e they make of their implanted powers. Their faculties at fir&s;t are feeble, but capable of gradual en|largement, and their enlargement in a great mea&s;ure de|pends on them&s;elves. Neither perfection nor happine&s;s, is communicated to us independent of our own choice and conduct, but in connection therewith, and in con&s;e|quence thereof, and as a reward therefor. And as this is the way that GOD hath cho&s;en to communicate happine&s;s, and we have good rea&s;on to believe, that he &s;aw it the fitte&s;t and be&s;t way, and being &s;o it was not po&s;&s;ible for him, acting morally, or as an intelligent wi&s;e agent, to communicate it any other way. And I think this appears to an attentive mind, the fitte&s;t method of communicat|ing good to rea&s;onable moral beings. And this rea&s;on|ing holds good with regard to all ranks of moral agents. In the &s;criptures we read of Angels which &s;inned, and of Angels which kept not their fir&s;t e&s;tate; which &s;uppo&s;es they were not made happy independent of their own vir|tuous conduct, but were made as men are, capable of happine&s;s but liable to voluntary &s;elf corruption. And all ranks of moral beings mu&s;t be created &s;o, if this was mo&s;t wi&s;e, and fit, and we have good rea&s;on to think it was &s;o. It does not &s;eem meet and fit, that happine&s;s &s;hould be conferred on moral intelligent beings; until they have gone through &s;ome &s;tate of trial, wherein they have made the happine&s;s proper to their natures their own choice.</P>
<P>This is certainly con&s;onent to the notions we mo&s;t rea|dily and naturally form of right and fit. And doubtle&s;s it did appear to the infinite and &s;upreme mind, to be the fitte&s;t way to communicate happine&s;s to moral beings; and if this was the real truth, it could not be within the moral power of the Deity, to have created free agents, and put them at once, without previous trial or improve|ment, in a &s;tate of full perfection, and confirmed happi|ne&s;s. And if &s;o they could not have been made impec|cable. As to the third and la&s;t way po&s;&s;ible to prevent moral defection, viz, by Deity's interpo&s;ing at all times, as occa&s;ion &s;hould require, to keep free agents from mi&s;|u&s;ing their liberty. And this looks like a moral impo&s;|&s;ibility,
<PB N="53" REF="026990_0052_0FD2B516615BE2F0">
as utterly unfit; in the rea&s;on of things, not being &s;uited to the nature of &s;uch kind of beings. Such a kind of government is well &s;uited to the unintelligent part of the creation, but un&s;uitable for moral agents, as it renders their moral agency wholly u&s;ele&s;s and and leaves no room for virtue, de&s;troys the moral gov|ernment of the Deity, and leaves no difference between them, and mere inanimate beings as to the Deity's exer|ci&s;ing rule over them. And why then &s;hould &s;uch pow|ers and abilities be given men, if they were by the inter|po&s;ition of the Deity thus tendered u&s;ele&s;s? The&s;e things con&s;idered, I think it not too much for us to &s;ay that GOD could not po&s;&s;ibly prevent &s;in; &s;ince it appears fit that moral agents &s;hould have a place in the &s;cale of be|ings, and this mu&s;t be with powers &s;o imperfect as to import a po&s;&s;ibility of their erring, without interpo&s;itions of the Deity to prevent it: which interpo&s;itions, could not con&s;i&s;t with wi&s;e and fit conduct, becau&s;e in true con&s;truction they would de&s;troy the very notion of free agency, and with it all foundation for any di&s;tinction between moral right and wrong.</P>
<P>The&s;e thoughts accrued to my mind, long &s;ince; when &s;tudying how to reconcile, the being of &s;in in the world, with the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of GOD, and were a relief to me, when I knew not as any other per&s;on ever thought in &s;uch a track. But upon con&s;ulting an|tiquity I found &s;everal among the ancients, who in their writing have &s;ugge&s;ted nearly the &s;ame thoughts. Among moderns Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> on the benevolence of the Deity is the be&s;t I have read, on the &s;ubject; I am much behol|den to him for that ingenious work.

<P>Mr. R. allows, a nece&s;&s;ity of being hardened but &s;ays 'tis
<Q>a nece&s;&s;ity of a moral kind&mdash;a certainty: yet this is no &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity as is oppo&s;ed to liberty. It is nece&s;&s;ary GOD &s;hould act in a holy manner; yet he acts with the mo&s;t perfect freedom. And there is a certain|ty that the glorified &s;aints will be holy and happy forev|er; by which their liberty, their moral agency will not be de&s;troyed or infringed; but confirmed and exalted.</Q>
What an attempt is here to reconcile the liberty of men in a &s;tate of trial with nece&s;&s;ity!</P>
<P>I would a&s;k Mr. R. whether GOD is in a &s;tate of trial, or can be tempted to do evil? Surely this is the ca&s;e with men. And as to what he &s;ays of glorified &s;aints it is openly fal&s;e; for if they are now in a confirmed &s;tate of holine&s;s they have lo&s;t their liberty, which they had in their &s;tate of trial; when they were not confirmed in ho|line&s;s. I am a&s;hamed, that &s;uch rea&s;oning, if it may be called rea&s;oning; &s;hould drop from the pen of a gentle|man of Mr. R's character. But unlucky for the good gentleman he propo&s;ed objections, to his &s;cheme, that never can be an&s;wered. And to me it is wonderful that he did not &s;ee that this objection was unan&s;werable. But we &s;hall find upon examination, that this is truly the ca&s;e with every objection, that they cannot be an&s;wered upon his principles; The fir&s;t part of the objection re&s;pects
<PB N="55" REF="026990_0054_0FD2B5192290A5E8">
the de&s;truction of liberty; and Mr. R. has done noth|ing to remove it. But before I pa&s;s to another objec|tion, I will attend to what he has to &s;ay to the other part of the objection, viz,
<Q>Men are mere machines; and there can be no rea&s;on to impute guilt and blame to them.</Q>
Mr. R. in reply &s;ays,
<Q>Men are not machined, for they move and act of choice, whereas in a mere machine there is no volition.</Q></P>
<P>But why did not Mr. R. con&s;ider, that the cattle on a thou&s;and hills act of choice as well as men? Mr. R. tells us,
<Q>If there is no liberty, and moral agency men are not to blame.</Q>
But all the liberty he allows men is liberty of choice, if this makes them moral agents, all the fi&s;hes in the &s;ea are moral agents. Mr. R. in&s;i&s;ts upon it that,
<Q>Sinners are not compelled to do wickedly; and becau&s;e they act voluntarily they are to blame, are wholly without excu&s;e.</Q>
But is it not a truth, and plain to the under&s;tanding of every man, except Mr. R. that, that which maketh a man &s;in by way of nece&s;&s;ity, with and not again&s;t his will, is the cau&s;e of his &s;in in a wor&s;e manner, than that which con&s;traineth him to &s;in again&s;t his will? I think it will be granted by all men, that he who by wicked art, draweth a man to &s;tab, hang, or poi&s;on him&s;elf, is in a gro&s;&s;er manner the cau&s;e of that evil action, then he that by force compelleth him, becau&s;e he maketh him to con&s;ent to his own death. Now if GOD's decrees do not only make men &s;in, but &s;in willing|ly too; not only cau&s;e that they &s;hall do evil, but will evil; GOD hath a deeper hand in men's &s;ins, than if he forced them again&s;t their wills. It is in vain therefore for Mr. R. to &s;ay,
<Q>Sinners are not compelled to do wickedly,</Q>
for according to him they are much wor&s;e than compelled. He tells us that GOD has decreed &s;in, that his providence orders the occa&s;ion; and he at the &s;ame time withholds that influence nece&s;&s;ary to pre|vent &s;in, &s;o that the &s;inner is under a nece&s;&s;ity of fining, and in order to make him guilty, he is by the arts of providence nece&s;&s;itated to will fin! This doctrine makes the &s;inners condition very &s;ad; but it is mo&s;t di&s;honorable to Almighty GOD. We now &s;ee, that Mr.
<PB N="56" REF="026990_0055_0FD2B4ED8993C840">
R. by attempting to remove this objection, has only made bad, wor&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>OBJ. 3. The &s;entence, whom he will he hardeneth, as it hath been &s;tated, implies a denial of the divine holine&s;s. For the moral law is a tran&s;cript of the di|vine perfections; di&s;covers the heart the will and plea|&s;ure of the Deity. He there forbids &s;in upon pain of eternal di&s;plea&s;ure, and repre&s;ents it to be that abomi|nable thing which his &s;oul abhors. But if &s;in was com|prehended in his plan and di&s;po&s;al of things, it mu&s;t be agreeable to his mind that &s;in &s;hould take place. And it is fal&s;e to &s;ay, he is of purer eyes than to behold ini|quity: for he mu&s;t according to this doctrine; behold it with complacency rather than abhorrence; becau&s;e it is his choice and the con&s;equence of his di&s;po&s;als.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. R. allows, that if the &s;entiment advanced doth really imply a denial, of any repugnancy to the holine&s;s of the Deity it ought to be rejected. And further he al|lows that &s;in is diametrically oppo&s;ite to holine&s;s, is what GOD mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily hate with perfect dete&s;tation. But in&s;i&s;ts upon it, there is no denial of holine&s;s in &s;aying GOD wills the event. To clear this he propo&s;es a di&s;|tinction to be con&s;idered, p. 45.
<Q>A di&s;tinction is to made between GOD's preceptive, and decretive provi|dential will. The Bible teaches us to make &s;uch a di&s;|tinction. And it is nece&s;&s;ary to reconcile what other|wi&s;e might appear to be irreconcilable. A di&s;tinction of this kind is evidently implied in what is &s;aid, re&s;pec|ting the conduct of Jo&s;eph's brethren, in &s;elling him to the I&s;hmaelites&mdash;in what is &s;aid re&s;pecting the king of A&s;&s;yria&mdash;and the part the Jews acted in the crucifixion of Chri&s;t. Now were &s;in in event as contrary to the decretive and providential, as &s;in it&s;elf is to the precep|tive will of GOD, we may be &s;ure it never would take place, on &s;uppo&s;ition there was a po&s;&s;ibility of prevent|ing it. And to &s;ay there was no po&s;&s;ibility is to limit the divine power. But GOD certainly could prevent it, if no other way, by withholding exi&s;tance. And this he no doubt would do rather than &s;in &s;hould take place, were &s;in in event, as contrary to his providen|tial as to his preceptive will.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="026990_0056_0FD2B51A5E4056C8">On reading what has been &s;aid above, Mr. R. may think, that it is no limitation of the divine power to &s;ay, that GOD could not po&s;&s;ibly prevent &s;in: and be le&s;s confident that if he could do it no other way, he would by withholding exi&s;tence. But in order to &s;et the mat|ter now before me in a clear light, it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to look a little into the di&s;tinction, which Mr. R. &s;ays is nece&s;&s;ary to be made; between GOD's preceptive and his decretive providential will. And likewi&s;e into the meaning of &s;in in <HI>event,</HI> as di&s;tingui&s;hed from &s;in <HI>it&s;elf.</HI> And then bring up to view, the &s;entence, whom he will he hardeneth, as it hath been &s;tated by Mr. R. and &s;ee whether there is in it any oppo&s;ition to the holine&s;s of the Deity. I am &s;orry that Mr. R. has not plainly told us what he means by the&s;e terms, then we &s;hould not be liable to mi&s;take him. However it is likely, he will agree with the A&s;&s;embly of Divines, that by the decree of GOD is to be under&s;tood, his eternal purpo&s;e, accor|ding to the coun&s;el of his own will, whereby for his own glory he foreordains what&s;oever comes to pa&s;s. As to GOD's providential will, it is likely he means, the con|&s;tant, wi&s;e, regular, powerful government of the world by GOD. By the preceptive will of GOD, he may un|der&s;tand, tho&s;e commands, laws and rules GOD has given to men, in his word. As to the di&s;tinction, between &s;in in <HI>event</HI> and <HI>&s;in it&s;elf,</HI> I am at a lo&s;s, re&s;pecting Mr. R's meaning; but I will venture to &s;uppo&s;e, that by &s;in it&s;elf, he means the &s;inful action, which the law forbids, and &s;o is again&s;t the preceptive will of GOD the lawgiver. And by &s;in in event the re&s;ult or i&s;&s;ue of the &s;inful action.</P>
<P>As to the &s;entence, whom he will he hardeneth, Mr. R. often tells us what it means, particularly, p. 15.
<Q>The great que&s;tion is what are we to under&s;tand by, whom he will he hardeneth? or in what &s;en&s;e may it be truly &s;aid that GOD hardeneth any man? This is a tremend|ou&s;ly delicate &s;ubject.&mdash;And there &s;eemeth to be dan|ger on both hands; &s;o that by &s;teering beyond the proper point to avoid Scylla, we may fall into Charyb|dis. And this I apprehend we &s;hall do. If on one

<P>After a long di&s;cour&s;e of &s;everal pages; in order to make out, that the event called &s;in, may not require the &s;ame agency of GOD for the production of it, as the effect call|ed holine&s;s, in p. 19. he comes to this conclu&s;ion.
<Q>To &s;um up the whole, I think it more &s;afe, and doth better accord with the &s;criptures to &s;ay, that GOD orders the occa&s;ion, and for wi&s;e and important ends doth not interpo&s;e that influence, which in the given circum&s;tan|ces would be nece&s;&s;ary to prevent &s;in and impenitence; than that he cau&s;es &s;in and impenitence by his own po&s;i|tive and immediate energy.</Q>
According to Mr. R. &s;in, and impenitence in &s;in, and the eternal ruin and de&s;|truction of &s;inners, is the effect of the will and agency of GOD. And to deny this, is to contradict the plaine&s;t a&s;&s;ertion of the pen of in&s;piration. The reader will here take notice, how Mr. R's mi&s;taking the meaning of the &s;cripture he predicated his di&s;cour&s;e upon, has unhappi|ly lead him into this bla&s;phemous opinion. But to &s;of|ten the matter a little, he is willing we &s;hould think, that GOD does not cau&s;e &s;in and impenitence by his own po&s;i|tive and immediate energy; but by his providence or|ders the occa&s;ion, at the &s;ame time withholds that influ|ence, which in the given circum&s;tances would be nece&s;|&s;ary to prevent &s;in and impenitence. But does this at all help the matter? Is it not true, that he that withholds light cau&s;es darkne&s;s? Is it not true, that he that with|holdeth a thing, which being pre&s;ent would hinder an event, is the &s;ole cau&s;e of the event? As he that with|holds a pillar which &s;hould &s;upport a hou&s;e, is the true cau&s;e of the falling of that hou&s;e. So GOD by withhhol|ding
<PB N="59" REF="026990_0058_0FD2B51BC6936538">
nece&s;&s;ary influence from men, is the true cau&s;e of their &s;in. It will not help the matter at all to &s;ay that GOD by withholding nece&s;&s;ary influence, becomes only an accidental, not a direct cau&s;e of men's &s;ins. For a cau&s;e is then only accidental in relation to the effect, when the effect is be&s;ide the intention &amp; expectation of the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>As digging in a field is then an accidental cau&s;e of fin|ding a bag of gold, when that event is not intended or expected by the hu&s;bandman in digging. But when the event is looked for and aimed at, the cau&s;e (though it be the cau&s;e only by withholding) is not accidental, as a pilot who withholdeth his care and &s;kill from a &s;hip in a &s;torm, fore&s;eeing that by his neglect the &s;hip will be lo&s;t, is not to be reputed an accidental, but a direct cau&s;e of the lo&s;s of that &s;hip. Hence, if it be true as Mr. R. tells us, that GOD hath decreed &s;in in event, and by his providence orders the occa&s;ion, he at the &s;ame time withholding nece|&s;&s;ary influence to prevent &s;in, not being ignorant of what will follow, but knowing it infallibly, determining preci&s;ely that which doth follow, namely the impenitence and dam|nation of &s;inners, becometh the proper and direct cau&s;e of their &s;ins and their damnation.</P>
<P>That Mr. R. had quite as good affirm that GOD cau|&s;es &s;in and impenitence, by his own po&s;itive and imme|diate energy. Mr. R. tells us that a di&s;tinction is to be made, between GOD's preceptive, and decretive provi|dential will; that &s;uch a di&s;tinction is nece&s;&s;ary in order to reconcile what otherwi&s;e might appear to be irrecon|cilable. But he has not applied it, and I know not how to do it. And for my life I cannot &s;ee, either any ground for the di&s;tinction, or any help it can po&s;&s;ibly af|ford. And I do hereby call upon Mr. R. to explain him&s;elf fully upon this head.</P>
<P>Mr. R. tells us,
<Q>that what&s;oever takes place through the &s;y&s;tem, from beginning to end, takes place in con|&s;i&s;tence with the decretive and providential will of GOD; but &s;in takes place in perfect oppo&s;ition to his precep|tive will.</Q>
But he denies that the decree is repugnant to the command. I will try to illu&s;trate this matter by what is recorded of David, 2 Sam. xi chap. I have al|ready
<PB N="60" REF="026990_0059_0FD2B4F43AF89E60">
ob&s;erved that if I under&s;tand Mr. R. by what he calls &s;in in event, and which he &s;ays is agreeable to the decretive and providential will of GOD; he means the re&s;ult or i&s;&s;ue of a wicked action. Now the re&s;ult of David's act of adultery with the wife of Uriah, was that &s;he was with child. This event of David's &s;in made a part of the divine plan, was what GOD purpo&s;ed accor|ding to the coun&s;el of his will and foreordained &s;hould be. And as GOD's decrees are powerful and active, his coun&s;el &s;tands and his plea&s;ure is done in heaven and on earth, providence therefore we may be &s;ure, will bring into event whatever GOD has decreed &s;hall be. Accor|dingly in this ca&s;e providence orders the occa&s;ion; Da|vid from the roof of his hou&s;e, &s;ees the woman, is &s;truck with her beauty, enquires her out, &s;ends for her, and when they come together that the eternal decree and purpo&s;e of GOD might not be fru&s;trated; GOD withholds from them both, that influence, which under the&s;e circum&s;tances, was nece&s;&s;ary to prevent Adultery. Accordingly David lay with her, and &s;he proving with child, the eternal de|cree and purpo&s;e of GOD was fulfilled, the end of his pro|vidence an&s;wered, and his will done, and David's prayers, if he prayed that the will of GOD might be done, were now mo&s;t happily an&s;wered. But there is a precept for|bidding this, under the name of Adultery, and threaten|ing death to the Adulterer; what &s;hall we do with this? The will of GOD decreeing the event, and ordering &s;uch a concurrence of circum&s;tances, as to render the action nece&s;&s;ary to the event eligible, and at the &s;ame time with|holding nece&s;&s;ary help again&s;t temptation, &s;eems not to agree with his forbidding the action, and under a &s;evere penalty too. It is wonderful to me, that when Mr. R. was making this di&s;cour&s;e, he did not advert to what the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, 1 Cor. x. 13. GOD is faithful, who will not &s;uffer you to be tempted above what ye are able; but will with the temptation al&s;o, make a way to e&s;cape, that ye may be able to bear it. I hope tho&s;e who&s;e minds may be filled with horror and de&s;pair, on viewing the character Mr. R. gives of our heavenly father, will ad|vert hereto and be comforted under all trials.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="026990_0060_0FD2B51D42A9D6C8">Mr. R. tells us p. 46.
<Q>It doth not follow, that the decree is in oppo&s;ition to the command&mdash;it doth not follow, that GOD's will in the former ca&s;e, oppo&s;es his will in the latter&mdash;it doth not follow that GOD hath two wills, thwarting each other. Were there a real op|po&s;ition, in&s;i&s;ting on the di&s;tinction would run us into the Manichean here&s;y, or what would be as gro&s;s. And would even amount to a denial of divine exi&s;tence.</Q>
What is there no oppo&s;ition between the will of GOD, de|creeing &s;in, ordering the occa&s;ion for it, and withhold|ing from men that influence nece&s;&s;ary to avoid it, and his will forbiding of it? Does not GOD's will decreeing and ordering &s;in oppo&s;e his will in forbiding of it? Doth it not follow that GOD hath two wills, thwarting each other, when he decrees &s;in and by his all powerful providence renders it inevitable, and yet in his law forbids it on pain of death? If GOD's will in all this is perfectly concor|dant, as Mr. R. tells us it is; I would pray him to tell us what does con&s;titute oppo&s;ition, or occa&s;ion things to thwart each other. I would pray Mr. R. to con&s;ider how he will make it appear that David and Uriah's wife &s;inned at all, &s;ince what they did was but fulfiling GOD's decree, and complying with his providence, and as to them inevitable, they having no power to do otherwi&s;e, or forbare doing as they did. Mr. R. has told us what he will &s;ay to this, p. 43.
<Q>And becau&s;e they act volun|tarily, re&s;pecting that which is evil and make the evil their own, they are to blame, are wholly without ex|cu&s;e.</Q>
But &s;urely they were not more to blame or in|excu&s;able than Balaam's a&s;s was for falling down under him. Sin has ever been con&s;idered by men, the will to do that from which we have freedom to ab&s;tain. But David and Uriah's wife had not that influence which was nece&s;&s;ary to prevent their doing ju&s;t as they did, and con&s;equently nece&s;&s;ary for them to do as they did, as nece&s;&s;ary as for Balaam's a&s;s to turn out of the way and at la&s;t to fall under him, and as &s;he was beat mo&s;t unju&s;tly, &s;o, according to Mr. R. to blame David and Uriah's wife for what they did would be mo&s;t unju&s;t. They cer|tainly wanted nothing but a righteous Judge and they
<PB N="62" REF="026990_0061_0FD2B4F795F6C1C8">
would be acquitted as well as the poor a&s;s; unle&s;s men have hitherto been mi&s;taken about what &s;in is. Mr. R. tells us p. 46.
<Q>Sin is con&s;idered by GOD, in his decree and providence relative to it, as being perfectly evil and hateful. And as &s;uch by him to be oppo&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P>Such a &s;entence as this, to fall from the lips of a gen|tleman of Mr. R's &s;entiments, is mo&s;t wonderful! If this be true, then when GOD willed to decree &s;in he hated to will it, or willed what he hated! i. e. Choo&s;e what he did not choo&s;e! And he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily hate his own decree, and his own providence that brings it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nto event, yea, he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily look upon his own decree and providence re&s;pecting &s;in, not only as being perfectly evil and hateful, but as what by him is to be con&s;tantly oppo&s;ed! Mr. R. tells us, p. 45.
<Q>What&s;oever takes place through the &s;y&s;tem, from beginning to end, takes place in con&s;i&s;tence with the decretive and providen|tial will of GOD; but &s;in takes place in perfect op|po&s;ition to his preceptive will.</Q>
In this &s;entence the&s;e three things are expre&s;&s;ed. 1. That &s;in does take place. 2. That it is agreeable to the decretive and providential will of GOD that it &s;hould. 3. That it is yet in perfect oppo&s;ition to his preceptive will. If this does not make out two wills in GOD, continually thwarting each other, I think no words can do it. Mr. R. tells us p. 46.
<Q>That while the exerci&s;e of one and the &s;ame will of the Deity is di&s;tingui&s;hed, it is and may appear, even to our un|der&s;tandings, perfectly harmonious.</Q>
Reply, It may ap|pear &s;o to Mr. R's under&s;tanding, but certainly it does not to mine. How a will exerci&s;ed in bringing into e|vent oppo&s;ites, as &s;in and holine&s;s, can be hermonious, is to me inconceivable. The harmony of the will exerci&s;ed upon oppo&s;ites, mu&s;t either de&s;troy the op|po&s;ition, or the oppo&s;ition mu&s;t de&s;troy the harmo|ny. If the will of GOD decreeing that Uriah's wife &s;hould be with child by David, is perfectly harmonious with his will forbidding adultery, then when Uriah's wife was with child by David according to the decretive and providential will of GOD, they could not be condemned by the precept forbidding adultery, nor could there be any rea&s;on for GOD's being di&s;plea&s;ed with David, for the
<PB N="63" REF="026990_0062_0FD2B51EECE42830">
thing that he had done. For this would at once de&s;troy the harmony of the divine will, exerci&s;ed in decreeing events and in giving laws; and clearly &s;how that they were oppo&s;ite and did thwart each other. Mr. R. mu&s;t now give up his di&s;tinction or run him&s;elf into &s;omething more gro&s;s, than the mi&s;take of Manes. In p. 47. Mr. R. &s;uppo&s;es, as well he might, that &s;ome would a&s;k,
<Q>Why may not GOD command his creatures to &s;in with a view to his own glory, and the advancement of holi|ne&s;s, as well as decree &s;in in event with &s;uch a view? (to which he an&s;wers) To all that can be urged in &s;uch a line, this will be a &s;ufficient rejoinder. That Paul has obviated and repelled with indignation a &s;imilar in|&s;inuation, as if it were a ju&s;t con&s;equence from the doctrine he had advanced, &s;ee Rom. iii. 7, 8.</Q>
But Mr. R. ought to con&s;ider, that there is no &s;imilarity be|tween the &s;ubject Paul was di&s;cour&s;ing and the &s;ubject of his di&s;cour&s;e. And although the objection the Apo&s;tle &s;uppo&s;es the Jews would make again&s;t his doctrine was without foundation, yet the objection again&s;t Mr. R's. doctrine is well founded, and could he have an&s;wered it, I think he would not have made u&s;e of &s;uch a mean eva|&s;ion. Upon the whole, the objection as &s;tated by Mr. R. &s;tands in full force again&s;t his &s;cheme, not only as it implies a denial of the divine holine&s;s, but as it mo&s;t evi|dently makes GOD the only &s;inner in the univer&s;e. And what he has &s;aid under the objection and to remove it, really makes the matter much wor&s;e, than otherwi&s;e it would have been. I have therefore his con&s;ent for re|jecting the &s;entence, whom he will he hardeneth, as &s;tat|ed by him.</P>
<P><Q>OBJ. 4. If GOD hath mercy on whom he will, and hardeneth whom he will, in the &s;en&s;e that hath been &s;tat|ed he is the mo&s;t tyrannical being in the univer&s;e. For it repre&s;ents him as exerci&s;ing an odious partiality in his treatment of his creatures, as making a multitude of ra|tional beings on purpo&s;e to damn them. And as acting manife&s;t inju&s;tice and cruelty in his di&s;po&s;al of things.</Q></P>
<P>To this Mr. R. replies, 1&s;t, by &s;hewing that &s;overeign|ty and tyranny are not the &s;ame. That although GOD is
<PB N="64" REF="026990_0063_0FD2B4F894923470">
a &s;overeign, it doth not follow that he is tyrant. But Mr. R. tells us that God withholds that influence from men, in the hour of trial, which is nece&s;&s;ary to prevent &s;in, who yet forbids it on pain of death. Now what makes a tyrant if requiring brick without &s;traw does not? 2d. Mr. R. tells us that,
<Q>In making one man unto honor and another unto di&s;honor, there is not the &s;hadow of in|ju&s;tice. This might be urged with good rea&s;on if God had, or &s;hould devote men to, de&s;truction without any con&s;ideration of their demerits.</Q></P>
<P>Let it be remembered here, that according to Mr. R. GOD not only decrees &s;in, but by his powerful provi|dence orders the occa&s;ion, at the &s;ame time withholding from men nece&s;&s;ary help again&s;t &s;in; &s;o that it becomes ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, that men &s;hould do otherwi&s;e than they do. Now is it not a plain ca&s;e, that &s;in is an action from which the &s;inner might ab&s;tain. But according to Mr. R. men can do no otherwi&s;e than they do; why then does he talk about demerit? According to him it is impo&s;&s;ible there can be any &s;uch thing. Three things are nece&s;&s;ary to make an action culpable. 1. That it be in our power to do or forbear it. 2. That we be obliged to do or forbear it. 3. That we omit what we ought to have done, or do what we ought not to have done.</P>
<P>If a tyrant &s;hould require me to tell whether the plan|et Jupiter is inhabited or not, or to fly to the moon, as one is above my intellectual faculty to di&s;cover, and the other above my active faculty to perform; neither of them can be my duty. And to neglect them cannot be my &s;in. According to Mr. R. tho&s;e whom GOD har|dens have no &s;in, and if damned as he &s;ays they will be; though they will be mo&s;t cruelly treated, yet they will &s;urely have a good con&s;cience, and be eternally a&s;&s;ured that could they but have a righteous judge, they &s;hould be honourably acquitted.</P>
<P N="3">3. Mr. R. tells us,
<Q>No cruelty will be exerci&s;ed. GOD will certainly inflict endle&s;s puni&s;hment upon finally impenitent &s;inners; yet he doth not delight in the death of &s;inners.</Q>
Reply, is it not cruel to inflict
<PB N="65" REF="026990_0064_0FD2B524D0B154A8">
endle&s;s puni&s;hment on men, for neglecting what they never could do; or doing what they never could avoid? And does not he delight in the death of men, who damn's them for nothing but his plea&s;ure?</P>
<P N="4">4. Mr. R. tells us p. 50 that,
<Q>Hardening &s;ome, and &s;aving others doth not make GOD to be a re&s;pector of per&s;ons, in the &s;en&s;e the &s;crip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;aith he is no re&s;|pector of per&s;ons.

Reply, the &s;entiment advanced by Mr. R. is that the ex|erci&s;e of mercy is wholly re&s;olved into the will and &s;ov|ereign plea&s;ure of the Deity, &s;ee p. 10. The &s;aying re|fered to, makes the fearing God, and working righteou&s;|ne&s;s the ground of acceptance. The &s;entiment is there|fore denied by the &s;aying. No &s;ays Mr. R. for

How vain is it for Mr. R. to try to reconcile his &s;entiments with &s;cripture. The reader now &s;ees, that the objection is not in the lea&s;t weakened by any thing that Mr. R. has &s;aid, but &s;tands in full force again&s;t him.</P>
<P><Q>OBJ. 5. The &s;ubject, as it hath been &s;tated and defended, makes GOD to act in a trifling in&s;incere manner, and impo&s;e upon men in the calls and offers of the go&s;pel. Becau&s;e he appears to expre&s;s great kind|ne&s;s and tenderne&s;s towards &s;inners, willing rather that they &s;hould turn and live; when he is determined at the &s;ame time, to withhold his &s;aving mercy from mul|titudes, and make them monuments of his eternal wrath. What po&s;&s;ible kindne&s;s and &s;incerity can their be in offering &s;alvation to any, except tho&s;e on whom he will have mercy? And why may it not with propriety be deemed ludicrous to invite and urge all to come? U&s;ing language too which carries the appearance of pa|thos
<PB N="66" REF="026990_0065_0FD2B4FA06612DC0">
and zeal, and proceeding &s;o far as to be&s;eech &s;in|ners to be reconciled; when by an unfru&s;trable decree he hath excluded from a &s;hare of his &s;aving mercy, it may he the greater part of tho&s;e to whom he makes the propo&s;al and gives the invitations, &s;o warmly and pa|thetically urged and enforced? And is determined that they &s;hall be hardened to their eternal de&s;truction.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. R. replies to this by &s;aying,
<Q>GOD is perfectly &s;incere in the offers he makes and the invitations he gives to &s;inners. Is as willing all &s;hould comply with his calls, as he is, that all &s;hould obey him.</Q>
But pray Sir, is GOD willing tho&s;e &s;hould obey him, from whom he withholds that influence nece&s;&s;ary to enable them &s;o to do? Is it not tantalizing men to clog the offers he makes them with impo&s;&s;ible conditions? Two ways Mr. R. attempts to vindicate the divine &s;incerity. 1&s;t. by &s;aying,
<Q>It is &s;ufficient to vindicate the divine &s;incerity, that GOD &s;tands ready to fullfill and be&s;tow what is &s;et forth in the calls and offers he gives and makes, on &s;uppo&s;ition they are complied with by &s;in|ners: For this is clear and certain, who&s;oever will may come; and him that cometh Chri&s;t will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out. There is no decree or divine di&s;po&s;al to prevent their coming if they will.</Q>
Here let it be remember|ed, that Mr. R. affirms a divine decree and di&s;po&s;al re|&s;pecting &s;in and impenitency therein; and that GOD ac|tually does withhold from men that influence nece&s;&s;ary to prevent &s;in and impenitency. Now that which di&s;a|bles a man from choo&s;ing good or refu&s;ing evil, mu&s;t de|&s;troy his liberty to choo&s;e good or refu&s;e evil. But GOD by withholding nece&s;&s;ary influence renders men totally unable to choo&s;e good or refu&s;ing evil, and of cour&s;e whol|ly de&s;troys all liberty of will. Hence there is no need of a decree to prevent their coming if they will, for the li|berty of their wills is already totally de&s;troyed; being determined by GOD's decree, providence and withhold|ing nece&s;&s;ary influence. Will Mr. R. &s;ay, that GOD does not take from men the faculty of willing, and there|fore they are to blame for not choo&s;ing good; &s;ince they attain the power. This is the &s;ame as to &s;ay, a Bird re|tains
<PB N="67" REF="026990_0066_0FD2B526C17E1098">
the power of flying when I hold his wings; or that a man chang'd, is free to walk, becau&s;e he retains the faculty of walking. Mr. R. mu&s;t remove out of the way his decrees, before he can vindicate the divine &s;in|cerity in making offers to men. The calls and offers GOD in his word gives and makes to men, upon Mr. R's principles, appears not a whit better, than it would in me, &s;hould I bind a man hand and foot, lock him up in a hou&s;e, then &s;et fire to it, and a&s;k him, why will you &s;tay there and be burnt? As I live I have no plea&s;ure in your death. Come unto me and you &s;hall not be ca&s;t out. But would not &s;uch conduct in me be morking and in&s;ulting upon the mi&s;ery of the man? But not more &s;o than go&s;pel offers are upon Mr. R's principles.</P>
<P N="2">2d. Mr. R. attempts to vindicate the divine &s;incerity by &s;aying as in p. 53.
<Q>There is the &s;ame kindne&s;s and &s;incerity as if GOD knew the offers would be mo&s;t cor|dially accepted. And his having mercy on &s;ome by di&s;po&s;ing them to except, is a di&s;tinct thing, and &s;uper|added to the calls and offers them&s;elves. Therefore, al|though it is readily conceded, that much greater kind|ne&s;s is exerci&s;ed by GOD towards tho&s;e on whom he hath mercy by making them willing in the day of his power, then towards tho&s;e who are not made willing: yet this greater mercy is not exerci&s;ed in the calls that are given, the offers that are made; but in re&s;pect to the offers and the arguments u&s;ed to induce a compliance, there is pre|ci&s;ely the &s;ame kindne&s;s and &s;incerity towards all.</Q>
i. e. none at all. For if &s;alvation depends on GOD's having mercy upon a per&s;on, and GOD's having mercy on them be a thing di&s;tinct from the calls and offers of the go&s;pel; then GOD in the calls and offers of the go&s;pel &s;hews <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o kindne&s;s to any, as I can &s;ee, The Angels quite mi&s;|under&s;tood the go&s;pel, and give us a very fal&s;e account of it, when they call it glad tidings of great joy to all people! Mr. R. tells us,
<Q>GOD might be &s;incere in making the offer to all on &s;uppo&s;ition none did, and not one ever &s;hould accept.</Q>
But your bu&s;ine&s;s Sir, is to &s;hew that GOD is &s;incere in making offers to tho&s;e he knows never can accept, and whom he has determined never &s;hall accept. Otherwi&s;e you do nothing towards an&s;wer|ing
<PB N="68" REF="026990_0067_0FD2B4FB8553D0B8">
the objection. Mr. R. &s;ays,
<Q>GOD is &s;incere, &s;erious and earne&s;t in requiring the &s;ubjection and obe|dience of all tho&s;e who are in a &s;tate of unregeneracy; although none in that &s;tate do yield a cordial &s;ubjection and obedience to his commands, and he knows perfectly well that they will not.</Q>
But does GOD know that they cannot? Has he predetermined that they &s;hall not? Do you mean to grant this in what followeth?
<Q>Al&s;o the not doing it, is as much the re&s;ult of the divine decree and di&s;po&s;al as hardening whom he will to their de&s;|truction is the re&s;ult of his decree and di&s;po&s;al.</Q></P>
<P>That the de&s;truction of men is the re&s;ult of the divine decree and di&s;po&s;al, you have before declared; here you affirm, that the di&s;obedience of men to GOD's commands is as much the re&s;ult of the divine decree and di&s;po&s;al. But this &s;ir, is what is objected to, and which the ob|jection &s;ays makes GOD to act in a trifling in&s;incere man|ner in the calls and offers of the go&s;pel. Do therefore reconcile the divine &s;incerity in the calls and offers of the go&s;pel, with &s;uch decrees and di&s;po&s;als, or own that you cannot an&s;wer the objection. Your &s;aying that GOD is &s;incere is not &s;atisfactory to me, I call for proof. You add,
<Q>We may as well &s;ay GOD acts &s;arca&s;tically, and tantalizes his creatures when he requires their &s;ubjec|tion and obedience, they being and remaining indi&s;po|&s;ed to yield obedience, as that he doth &s;o, when he makes offers, they being indi&s;po&s;ed to accept them.</Q>
Very true when creatures di&s;obedience is the re&s;ult of GOD's decree and di&s;po&s;al, he does tantalize, in&s;ult and abu&s;e them by commands, offers &amp;c. as I &s;ay; and you offer no proof to the contrary; yet go about to &s;top my mouth by dint of authority, when you &s;ay,
<Q>Who art thou that thus replie&s;t again&s;t GOD? let thy mouth be &s;topped; or &s;urely, thou &s;halt be mo&s;t ju&s;tly condem|ned.</Q>
This &s;ir, I de&s;pi&s;e in you, and it convinces me that you felt your&s;elf weak, or you would never take &s;uch a method to &s;ilence objectors. I do not reply again&s;t GOD, but again&s;t the fal&s;e character you ignorantly or wickedly give of the ever glorious GOD. And call upon you to vindicate your&s;elf from the guilt of &s;landering the

father of mercies before the world, if you can. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as you have nothing to &s;ay for your&s;elf. This objection, therefore like others lies with all its force again&s;t you.</P>
<P><Q>OBJ. 6. This is a gloomy uncomfortable doctrine calculated to bad men; e&s;pecially awakened &s;inners to de&s;pair: or el&s;e to &s;tif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le their convictions. The natur|al tendency of it is to render means and endeavours vain and u&s;ele&s;s. For if it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runeth: If the unregenerate may not lay any claim to &s;aving mercy after all their mo&s;t pain|ful &s;eekings and &s;trivings: If there is a certain num|ber on whom GOD will have mercy, and a certain num|ber whom he will harden to their de&s;truction, to what purpo&s;e can it be to &s;eek and &s;trive? each &s;inner may &s;ay, if I am to be &s;aved, I &s;hall be &s;aved, and if I am to peri&s;h I &s;hall peri&s;h, let my exertions be as they may. And &s;ince it is not left to men to determine their own character, and a&s;certain their eternal &s;tate, but it hangs on a decree and di&s;po&s;al which they cannot fru&s;trate; let them &s;tand &s;till, and &s;ee what GOD means to do, whether to &s;ave or damn; and give them&s;elves no exerci&s;e and concern about that which doth not be|long to them; and which to &s;ay it doth belong to them implies a denial of GOD's e&s;&s;ential, inalienable prero|gative.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. R. has attempted five an&s;wers to this objection, without &s;aying one word that does in the lea&s;t degree weaken it, but rather e&s;tabli&s;h it; particularly by his fourth an&s;wer, which is,
<Q>There is not the lea&s;t ground from the doctrine to &s;ay, if we are to be &s;aved we &s;hall be &s;aved, let us live as we may, and whether we take any pains or not. Becau&s;e repentance, faith, and obe|dience are implied in, or will certainly follow the exer|ci&s;e of &s;aving mercy, whenever it is be&s;towed upon any.</Q></P>
<P>The objection &s;ays, &s;ince there is a certain number on whom GOD will have mercy and a certain number whom he will harden to their de&s;truction; each &s;inner may &s;ay, if I am to be &s;aved I &s;hall be &s;aved &amp;c.&mdash;all exertions are

vain, e&s;pecially &s;ince it is not left with men to determine their own character &amp;c.&mdash;Mr. R. &s;ays, there is no ground for this objection, becau&s;e repentance, faith, and obedience are implied in, or will certainly follow the ex|erci&s;e of &s;aving mercy, whenever it is be&s;towed upon any. Now, according to Mr. R. eternal &s;alvation is connected with GOD's having mercy on any; but GOD's having mercy on any, depends neither in whole nor in part upon any thing done by them, or any &s;tate of mind they may be in. Therefore, if faith, repentance, and obedience, do certainly follow GOD's having mercy on any, it is a good rea&s;on why &s;inners &s;hould be uncon|cerned about faith, repentance and obedience, for as the&s;e will follow mercy, but not at all further it, there is no rea&s;on why &s;inners &s;hould be concerned about them. Every &s;inner may now &s;ay, not only, if I am to be &s;aved I &s;hall be &s;aved, and if I am to peri&s;h I &s;hall peri&s;h; but if I am to have repentance, faith and obedience. I &s;hall have them, and if I am to remain impenitent, un|believing and di&s;obedient I &s;hall remain &s;o. That upon Mr. R's &s;cheme, there is not one whit more rea&s;on for any man's concerning him&s;elf about religion, than about the ebbing and flowing of the tide. All that Mr. R. has done, in his an&s;wer to this objection, is to &s;how that &s;inners have good rea&s;on to be unconcerned about the means of &s;alvation as well as about &s;alvation it&s;elf I Mr. R. &s;ays, he apprehends the&s;e objections to be the mo&s;t con&s;iderable that any can advance again&s;t his &s;cheme. I do not think &s;o of them. However I have carefully attended the &s;cuffle he has had with them, and find them all &s;tanding in as good quality, condition and repair as before he threw a &s;now-ball at them. And Mr. R. has greatly di&s;honoured him&s;elf, by attempting to an&s;wer, that, which upon his plan, is ab&s;olutely unan&s;werable.</P>
<P N="6">6. I come as propo&s;ed to make &s;ome remarks on Mr. R's improvement of his &s;ubject. The improvement be|gins, p. 57. And is as followeth.</P>
<P N="1">1.
<Q>From what hath been urged and illu&s;trated in the preceeding di&s;cour&s;e we may learn the vanity and futil|ity of the objections, commonly advanced, again&s;t the
<PB N="71" REF="026990_0070_0FD2B52958349050">
devine decrees. And that decree in particular, where|by a certain number of mankind were from eternity ordained to everla&s;ting life, called the decree of election. The doctrine of an eternal decree, in a general view, is di&s;carded by many. Barely to mention in eternal irrevocable decree fires their indignation; and more e&s;pecially to mention and in&s;i&s;t upon the decree of elec|tion. If GOD according to the coun&s;el of his own will from eternity, did choo&s;e a certain number in Chri&s;t and appoint them to obtain &s;alvation, and pa&s;s by the re&s;t; and that number will be &s;aved and the re&s;t per|i&s;h. Then &s;ay they: He mu&s;t be a hateful re&s;pect|or of per&s;ons, one who exerci&s;es partiality, inju&s;tice and cruelty: Mu&s;t have a de&s;ign to make creatures on purpo&s;e to damn them, and &s;port with their mi&s;ery and de&s;truction: Mu&s;t be the author of their &s;in and de&s;|truction: Events are unalterably fixed beforehand; and being fixed, there can be no liberty in re&s;pect to choo&s;ing and acting: men are machines, and ought not to be blamed: The old heatheni&s;h doctrine of fate is palmed upon the Bible: A great part of mankind have no chance for their lives: And it is as much an vain for men to &s;eek and &s;trive and exert them&s;elves, as it is to attempt to alter immutability it&s;elf. In a word, men are chained down by unfru&s;trable decree; the di|vine government is an exerci&s;e of the mo&s;t obdious ty|ranny: and it is not rea&s;onable, nor po&s;&s;ible to love a being of &s;uch a character. It is in a mi&s;erable way of rea&s;oning, that &s;uch con&s;equences are drawn, and turn|ed into objections again&s;t the divine decree, in general, and that of election, in particular, they are mo&s;t not all of them illogical, unfounded, vain and imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ious.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. R. has plainly told us his &s;en&s;e of the doctrine of election in the&s;e words,
<Q>GOD according to the coun&s;el of his own will from eternity, did choo&s;e a certain num|ber in Chri&s;t and appoint them to obtain &s;alvation, and pa&s;s by the re&s;t, and that number will be &s;aved, and the re&s;t peri&s;h.</Q>
This I &s;uppo&s;e to be Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'s own &s;entiment, or that opinion of the decree or election which he means to defend. He denies a conditional election,
<PB N="72" REF="026990_0071_0FD2B501B4789A18">
mo&s;t expre&s;sly, p. 39,
<Q>There cannot be any conditio|nal decree or determination in the divine mind, re&s;pec|ting his having mercy on &s;ome and hardening others.</Q>
Mr. R's. opinion then is plainly this, namely, that GOD from eternity choo&s;e a certain number in Chri&s;t, whom he by an ab&s;olute decree appointed to &s;alvation; who &s;hall all infallibly be &s;aved, all the re&s;t be pa&s;&s;ed by, or left; and they &s;hall infallibly peri&s;h. That &s;alvation was from eternity as certain to all cho&s;en, and damna|tion as certain from eternity to all pa&s;&s;ed by, as GOD could make any thing.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now undertake to &s;how that all the con&s;equen|ces mentioned by Mr. R. as drawn from the decree of election, do nece&s;&s;arily follow from his own opinion of that doctrine as here &s;et down by him. And in doing this, I will take them &s;eparately as they follow.</P>
<P N="1"><Q>1. Then GOD mu&s;t be a hateful re&s;pector of per|&s;ons.</Q>
That GOD is the judge of all the earth. That he has given his rea&s;onable creatures a law, or rule of duty: and required them to obey his commands, promi|&s;ing rewards to the obedient, and threatening puni&s;hment to the di&s;obedient. And has bound him&s;elf to deter|mine their character, reward and puni&s;h them according as they &s;hall be found, keepers or tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of the law, that they are under. The&s;e are things which I &s;uppo&s;e need no proof. But Mr. R. tells us, that GOD from eternity did choo&s;e &s;ome in Chri&s;t and appoint them to obtain &s;alvation, leaving the re&s;t to peri&s;h. But is this according to law? He further tells us,
<Q>There is a mo&s;t wide and important difference in the exerci&s;e of &s;aving mercy, it is not be&s;towed upon all mankind; but upon &s;ome only even tho&s;e upon whom GOD is plea&s;ed to be&s;tow it.</Q></P>
<P>Now if men's characters are determined and eternal &s;tate fixed according to the plea&s;ure of the judge; the law is not the rule. But if a judge favours one and frowns upon, another according to his own plea&s;ure, is he not partial? Why were &s;ome cho&s;en, when others were pa&s;|&s;ed by? all were equally near, equally needy, and equal|ly de&s;erving or unde&s;erving. Why then were &s;ome pa&s;|&s;ed
<PB N="73" REF="026990_0072_0FD2B52B587F87B8">
by and left to peri&s;h? Mr. R. tells us it was the plea|&s;ure of GOD. But does not this to all intents make GOD a re&s;pecter of per&s;ons? Mr. R. tells us p. 13, that,
<Q>No &s;ituation&mdash;external circum&s;tances, or even &s;tate of mind per&s;ons may be in antecedently to regeneration, ought to be con&s;idered as having the lea&s;t influence in the divine determination, re&s;pecting the be&s;towment of his &s;aving mercy.</Q>
Reply, if the objects of &s;aving mercy were cho&s;en from eternity and appointed to &s;al|vation, as Mr. R. tells us; I can ea&s;ily believe, that re|penting, confe&s;&s;ing and for&s;aking &s;in, or any &s;eeking or &s;triving of &s;inners, will have no influence on the divine mind to be&s;tow mercy on any. But what does influence GOD to choo&s;e &s;ome of his children to be happy and leave others to be mi&s;erable? Their circum&s;tances were exactly alike, and for a judge to favour one and frown upon another, when in equal circum&s;tances is to have re&s;pect to per&s;ons; and what makes it hateful, is that it is contrary to equity. GOD as benefactor, may give five talents to one and but two to another, without wrong to any; but as a judge he has bound him&s;elf to do right. But to reward &s;ome with life and puni&s;h others with death, who are in equal circum&s;tances, mu&s;t make him a hate|ful re&s;pecter of per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Mr. R. p. 51, propo&s;es the ca&s;e of a per&s;on,
<Q>Ha|ving an e&s;tate and no natural heir, (who he &s;ays) might &s;elect one, or a few ju&s;t as he &s;hould plea&s;e, on whom to confer his e&s;tate, and no one would have a right to tax him with being a re&s;pecter of per&s;ons, becau&s;e he did not bequeath it to all without di&s;crimination. And if &s;uch a prerogative is allowed to men, in re&s;pect to what they po&s;&s;e&s;s and call their own, &s;hall not GOD be&s;tow his &s;pecial favours on whom he plea&s;es, without the imputation of being an odious re&s;pecter of per&s;ons?</Q>
Reply, if the per&s;on holding the e&s;tate, requires of all, &s;omething to be done, in order to their inheriting his e&s;tate, and he gives the nece&s;&s;ary aid to &s;ome to do what he requires, and withholds it from others, in like cir|cum&s;tances he is an odious re&s;pecter of per&s;ons. And &s;uch a one Mr. R. makes the ever glorious GOD to be,

<P>According to Mr. R. tho&s;e that are &s;aved are not one whit better or more de&s;erving than tho&s;e that peri&s;h. They were alike in eternity when the decree was made; and as to any difference in time, according to him it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> wholly effected by a &s;upernatural influence, in which they have no hand, as it is quite above their agency, and for which they are none the better.

<P>The excellent Bi&s;hop Hoadly, on terms of acceptance with GOD, p. 302, has this true ob&s;ervation,
<Q>If virtue be nothing but the irre&s;i&s;table operation of GOD upon us, there can be no rea&s;on in the world a&s;&s;ign'd why GOD &s;hould hate and puni&s;h a wicked man and love and reward another: becau&s;e as to them&s;elves they are exactly alike. The only difference here &s;uppo&s;ed is this, that GOD is plea&s;ed after an arbitrary manner, to work upon one: and wholly to pa&s;s by the other. If any parent &s;hould heap his favours upon one child, and then &s;how the greate&s;t fondne&s;s to him, merely be|cau&s;e tho&s;e favours have been heaped upon him, and ab&s;olutely refu&s;e to be&s;tow the lea&s;t degree of the &s;ame upon another of his children, and yet hate and puni&s;h him becau&s;e he had not what he could not have without his will; would not all the world condemn &s;uch a par|ent of the mo&s;t partial fondne&s;s, and the mo&s;t arbitra|ry proceeding; and attribute it to nothing but weak|ne&s;s of under&s;tanding, or &s;trength of pa&s;&s;ion? And yet this is what we are not afraid to lay upon Almighty GOD, when we repre&s;ent him as doing all for &s;ome, with an irre&s;i&s;table arm, and then loving them for what they have no part in, and on the other &s;ide, as pa&s;&s;ing by others, and refu&s;ing them the &s;ame &s;trength without which they cannot move, and yet hateing and condem|ning them for not being what they cannot be, and not doing what they cannot do.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. 'Then GOD is partial, unju&s;t and cruel.' And is not GOD more favourable to tho&s;e of his offspring that he

<Q>6. There can be no liberty in re&s;pect to choo&s;ing and acting.</Q>
If as you &s;ay, GOD cho&s;e &s;ome and pa&s;|&s;ed by others from eternity, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for men to choo&s;e or act, with regard to their future &s;tate; being quite as de&s;titute of liberty as a &s;tone.</P>
<P N="7"><Q>7. Then men are machines, and ought not to be blamed.</Q>
You deny to man a &s;elf determining power with regard to his volitions. Now as this is the ba&s;is of moral obligation; to talk of moral agency, unle&s;s this be fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed, is to contradict common &s;en&s;e. We might it is true, without the implantation of &s;uch a pow|er, in our natures, in con&s;equence of a chain of exterior cau&s;es, not within the reach of our controul, be made in&s;truments in the production of any effects which are unavoidably connected with their chain of fatality, &s;hould even volition or choice be one of its links. But free agents we could not be, and it could never with truth be affirmed of us that we were the producers of the&s;e ef|fects. Mr. R's decree of election, totally de&s;troys mor|al agency, and makes all men machines re&s;pecting the world to come. True we may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from windmills, carts and ploughs, becau&s;e con&s;cious and voluntary, whereas they are not. But there is an e&s;&s;en|tial difference between con&s;cious voluntary machines and agents. An agent mu&s;t be the efficient cau&s;e of his own volitions and actions. But &s;uch we are not, if there be &s;uch a decree as Mr. R. tells of; and therefore at be&s;t but machines, and con&s;equently ought not to be bla|med.</P>
<P N="8"><Q>8. The old heathen doctrine of fate is palmed upon the Bible.</Q>
Some among the Pagan philo&s;ophers, in former ages thought, that all effects take ri&s;e from a chain of cau&s;es, with the Deity at its head as the only efficient, &s;o unavoidably linked together, connected with, and dependent on each other, that the coming of the&s;e effects into event, in con&s;equence of the unavoidable operation of the&s;e cau&s;es, was not only certain, but ab&s;olutely inevitable. And they con&s;idered mankind, with all their powers, as &s;o many links in the adamantine chain, no one of which can po&s;&s;ibly fail in the produc|tion

of the effect a&s;&s;igned to it. This is the old heathen|i&s;h doctrine of fate. And the very doctrine which Mr. R. labours to palm upon the Bible, under the name of the decree of election, with regard to &s;in, he affirms a di|vine decree and di&s;po&s;al, and a continued &s;eries, a con|firmed &s;tate in wickedne&s;s, ending in eternal ruin and de&s;truction. p. 16.</P>

But here is &s;omething that at a di&s;tance looks like rea&s;oning, in page 58. I mu&s;t take notice of that as I pa&s;s a long.
<Q>If the divine providence can be vindi|cated, in re&s;pect to things taking place as they do in fact take place, a divine decree pre-ordaining the taking place of things as they do take place, will be vindicat|ed of cour&s;e; for the former is a full unan&s;werable vindication of the latter.</Q>
I will try this rea&s;oning by a particular in&s;tance.</P>
<P>Mr. R. allows that it was refered to Adam to deter|mine his own character and &s;tate. But Adam with the&s;e high powers committed to him did tran&s;gre&s;s and eat the
<PB N="79" REF="026990_0078_0FD2B52F6353F9D0">
forbidden fruit. Now how can providence be vindicat|ed in &s;uffering this to take place? E&s;ily as I think, for &s;ince GOD had made him a moral agent, and &s;et life and death before him, and his own choice and con&s;equent actions were to determine his character and &s;tate, it was fit that he &s;hould be left to act for him&s;elf, and unfit that providence &s;hould interpo&s;e to &s;top him, and therefore what GOD could not do; as I have el&s;ewere &s;hown. But does this vindication of providence in the taking place of this event, vindicate a divine decree preordaining the e|vent? By no means. For GOD's decrees are powerful and active, comprehending &s;uch means as &s;hall unfru&s;tr|ably produce the event decreed. But to affirm this with regard to the fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, is to make GOD the author, and indeed the door of the &s;in; and frees Adam from all blame. Thus it appears that providence can be vindi|cated in re&s;pect to things taking place as they do, when a degree preordaining the taking place of things as they do take place, cannot; but would be bla&s;phemy to affirm. I am &s;orry to &s;ee &s;uch &s;ophi&s;try made u&s;e of, the truth never needs it. Mr. R. tells us p. 58.
<Q>If man will ob|ject&mdash;let them fault the &s;y&s;tem and not the divine deter|mination.&mdash;And evince that &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem in the final i&s;&s;ue is not a good one.</Q>
Reply, I have no objections to the divine plan, I believe it wi&s;e, holy, ju&s;t, and good, But I object to your plan as totally bad, un&s;criptural and anti&s;criptual, unfit for GOD to reveal or men to be|lieve. And you may be &s;ure Sir, that di&s;cour&s;e contains no part of GOD's plan; if we are to judge of it by God's holy word, to which you refer us. Mr. R. proceeds.</P>
<P N="2"><Q>2. We may learn the obligation men are under to admit the doctrine which teaches, that GOD is a &s;over|eign in the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e, an ab&s;olute &s;overeign.</Q>

<P>He &s;ays p. 60, that with re&s;pect to mens eternal &s;tate,
<Q>Many will admit no &s;uch thing as a divine determina|tion and di&s;po&s;al, in&s;i&s;ting that it is left to men them|&s;elves

<P N="3"><Q>3. We may learn the importance not only of a&s;&s;ent|ing to the divine &s;overeignty, but al&s;o, of being cordially reconciled to it.</Q>
Reply, It is really of importance that we cordially &s;ubmit, to the &s;overeignty of GOD, in the differ|ence he makes among his creatures; in be&s;towing origi|nal favours. But as &s;overeignty has been explained by Mr. R. we never ought to &s;ubmit to it. Mr. R. tells us,
<Q>The wicked at the day of Judgement will without doubt be fully convinced of the truth and ju&s;tice of that &s;entence, every mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th be &s;topped, &amp;c.</Q>
But why did he not con&s;ider, that his decree of election is ab&s;olute|ly incon&s;i&s;tent with a day of Judgement; and with the &s;elf condemnation of all tho&s;e, he tells us were pa&s;&s;ed by from eternity!</P>
<P>Mr. R. tells us that &s;ome,
<Q>Re&s;ent with acrimony the idea of GOD's determining the character, and di&s;po&s;ing of the eternal &s;tate of men as he plea&s;es. They who do thus are the enemies of GOD.</Q>
I am &s;orry to &s;ee &s;uch uncharitable judging in this good gentleman; and will impute it rather to his pernicious principles than to his want of a benevolent heart. It is doubtle&s;s the duty of every man to reject the idea, Mr. R. holds up to view, as infinitely di&s;honourable to the ever glorious God, and de&s;tructive of all religion. Mr. R. proceeds,</P>
<P N="4"><Q>4. We may infer, that want of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to GOD's &s;overeignty, and the objections advanced again&s;t his uncontroulable dominion mu&s;t be owing to &s;omething that is criminal and very wrong.</Q>
True, if the doct|rine of the divine &s;overeignty be rightly explained. I have no rea&s;on to complain becau&s;e GOD made me a man, and not an Angel; or becau&s;e he gave my brother five talents, and me but two.</P>

But why did not Mr. R. con&s;ider, that in &s;aying thus, he reflected upon the wi&s;|dom of GOD, in making u&s;e of this very method, under every di&s;pen&s;ation, to bring men to be reconciled to him&s;elf? Reconciliation to GOD, Mr. R. tells us, can be effected no other way but by being <HI>born of God.</HI> I am &s;orry he has not told us what he means by being <HI>born of God</HI>; that we might know whether we have any part in it or not. If it is &s;omething that belongs wholly to GOD, then we are not to blame that the work is not done; and our being unreconciled is not our fault. Mr. R. proceeds,</P>
<P N="6"><Q>6. The &s;ubject pre&s;ents a criterion by which men may try them&s;elves, and come to know what manner of &s;pirit they are of, know their true character and &s;tate.</Q>
Mr. R. propo&s;es that we put it to our&s;elves, whether it &s;eem proper and fit, that GOD &s;hould have mercy on whom he will, and harden to their eternal de&s;truction whom he will: and whether we are willing to &s;ubmit all to his arbitrament without any re&s;ervation. To me, this appears a very &s;trange rule of trial. In order to know whether I am reconciled to GOD, I mu&s;t find my&s;elf wil|ling that my fellow creatures &s;hould be eternally de&s;troy|ed, and what is this but having a will oppo&s;ed to the will of GOD, who has declared that he will have all men to be &s;aved! That to be reconciled to GOD my will mu&s;t oppo&s;e GOD's will! But perhaps Mr. R. may intend GOD's decretive, providential will, which according to him is in con&s;tant oppo&s;ition to his preceptive will! Further Mr. R. would have me be willing to &s;ubmit all to GOD's arbitrament without any re&s;ervation. If &s;o, I &s;ee not but I mu&s;t be willing to be damned my&s;elf, as well as have my neighbours damned. Mr. R. &s;ays, 'At this &s;ome may boggle.' I do not wonder he thought &s;ome would boggle. But he goes on to &s;ay,
<Q>If being willing to &s;uffer the damnation of hell is implied in a true &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and reconciliation to GOD; &s;uch wil|lingne&s;s would certainly be right and fit.</Q>
Reply,
<PB N="82" REF="026990_0081_0FD2B50A8DE7AD58">
con&s;idering what a &s;ort of creature man is, it is quite un|fit that he &s;hould be willing to be damned. And if &s;uch willingne&s;s were nece&s;&s;ary in order to reconciliation to GOD, I &s;ee not, but it is be&s;t man never &s;hould be recon|ciled to GOD.</P>
<P>In p. 66 Mr. R. tells us plainly what he e&s;teems true &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to GOD.
<Q>In true &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion men re&s;olve them&s;elves into the will of GOD; and make a &s;urrender to his di&s;po&s;als with no more than this: it may be he will have mercy, and if he doth not he is perfectly ju&s;t and divinely glorious.</Q>
Mr. R. tells us, that it was the will of GOD from eternity, that &s;ome men &s;hould be damned, even all that he pa&s;&s;ed by. To be re&s;olved in|to the will of GOD, therefore, according to him, does imply, 1&s;t. That I am willing that &s;ome of my fellow creatures &s;hould be damned. 2d. That I am willing to be damned my&s;elf upon it &s;o falling out, that I am one that was pa&s;&s;ed by. But is this right? mu&s;t I be wil|ling that tho&s;e for whom Chri&s;t died &s;hould be damned eternally? That tho&s;e whom GOD will have to be &s;aved &s;hould be damned eternally? How does this agree with my duty to love and pray for all? And as to being wil|ling to be damned my&s;elf, 'tis the &s;ame as to be willing to oppo&s;e the will of GOD and Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Furthermore, Mr. R. tells me that in true &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion I mu&s;t &s;ay that GOD is perfectly ju&s;t, though he doth not have mercy on me. At this I &s;hall certainly 'boggle.' For I do not &s;ee it to be equitable, that &s;uch a difference &s;hould be made, by the great parent of all between the children of his family, and where there is no equity, there is no ju&s;tice. I believe it to be unju&s;t and cruel in the highe&s;t degree, to choo&s;e one and pa&s;s by another, as Mr. R. tells us GOD did from eternity. But ble&s;&s;ed be GOD we have no evidence of &s;uch a decree of election but Mr. R's word; which we count not worth a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ru&s;h, in this ca&s;e. As to what Mr. R. &s;ays, about our &s;ub|mitting the matter of our &s;alvation to GOD, I think he is wholly wrong. When we pray for earthly good things, as food, friends, &amp;c. we ought to pray for the&s;e with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of GOD; becau&s;e GOD has
<PB N="83" REF="026990_0082_0FD2B532BADEC530">
not made his will known to us in the&s;e matters, other|wi&s;e than in general terms; we ought therefore, to refer our&s;elves to the will, wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of GOD, to be dealt with as he &s;ees be&s;t for us, in our pre&s;ent &s;tate of education. But not &s;o with regard to eternal life, be|cau&s;e GOD has expre&s;sly told us that it is his will we we &s;hould have eternal life. To pray therefore for this with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion as for earthly good things would be to call in que&s;tion the truth of GOD's word, which declares GOD willing the &s;alvation of all men. In prayer there|fore we are to con&s;ider eternal &s;alvation as what GOD wills we &s;hould have, and what his grace has brought to eve|ry man, and what no man can mi&s;s of upon any other terms but his own putting of it away from him. Upon the whole, it is my opinion, that what Mr. R. calls a true &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is what would be very wrong, wicked and &s;inful for any man to make. As to what Mr. R. has &s;aid about an eternal refu&s;al to &s;ubmit to GOD, belonging to the character and &s;tate of the damned, who he &s;ays will be the eternal enemies of GOD. I freely own I do not believe it. But be it &s;o, according to Mr. R. this is agreeable to the will of GOD! But I would pray him to con&s;ider how he can reconcile this opinion of his, to the Apo&s;tle, 1 Cor. xv. 26, The la&s;t enemy &s;hall be de&s;troyed, death.</P>
<P>Mr. R's di&s;cour&s;e clo&s;es with a word of advice to pro|fane &s;inners, the &s;elf righteous and awakened &s;inners. I wonder the good gentleman did not con&s;ider, that if he was ever a&s;ked a rea&s;on for this, he mu&s;t be &s;ilent, or do wor&s;e. Pray &s;ir, how could you be &s;o cruel to profane &s;inners, as to try to terrify them with fear of hell, when you know their &s;tate was determined from eternity. And in this di&s;cour&s;e you declare that no &s;tate of mind has the lea&s;t influence in the divine determination re&s;pecting the be&s;towment of mercy? How could you go about to ter|rify and trouble the &s;elf-righteous, when certainly &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s is better than no righteou&s;ne&s;s, and you know that no righteou&s;ne&s;s can break up GOD's eternal decrees? How could you caution awakened &s;inners a|gain&s;t delu&s;ions and mi&s;takes, as though they were in
<PB N="84" REF="026990_0083_0FD2B50C9DF12170">
danger from the&s;e? When you know, that all that GOD cho&s;e from eternity mu&s;t be &s;aved, and all he pa&s;&s;ed by mu&s;t peri&s;h? Had you been con&s;i&s;tent with your &s;elf, you would have told the profane, never to admit fear or care about their future &s;tate. The &s;elf righteous, to per&s;evere in their &s;elf righteou&s;ne&s;s, as it was good and profitable unto men. And the awakened you would have &s;oothed as much as po&s;&s;ible, and plainly told them that their fears were quite fruitle&s;s.</P>
<P N="7">7thly. I &s;hall conclude as propo&s;ed by a letter to the Rev. Mr. ROBBINS.</P>
<P>REV. SIR, as you &s;ubmitted your di&s;cour&s;e, to pub|lic in&s;pection, you will not be offended with me that I have examined it. Had I not Judged upon reading of it, that it was mo&s;t di&s;honorable to GOD, injurious to re|ligion, and greatly encouraging &s;in, I had not taken &s;uch notice of it as I have. I have con&s;tantly endeavoured to under&s;tand your true meaning; and am not &s;en&s;ible that I have in any in&s;tance mi&s;taken it. I am a total &s;trang|er to you, otherwi&s;e than by reading the di&s;cour&s;e that is now before me. Mo&s;t certainly Sir I read your di&s;|cour&s;e without any prejudice again&s;t your per&s;on. But perhaps two men profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tianity never thought more differently from each other than we do. But al|though I look upon your di&s;cour&s;e, taken connectively as not containing one word of truth in it; yet I am wil|ling to con&s;ider you &s;ir, as one that truly fears GOD, loves the truth and would knowingly do nothing again&s;t it. Dr. Williams &s;ays of Dr. Cri&s;p, that he believes he was a pious and Godly man: that his life was a contra|diction to his doctrines; that the grace of GOD pre&s;er|ved his heart from being corrupted, by his wicked bla&s;phemous opinions. I am willing to have the &s;ame opinion dear &s;ir, of you; and would treat you accordingly. We are here in a dark &s;tate, and know but in part; I would ever be jealous of my&s;elf, that I may be wrong, willing to &s;ee my own mi&s;takes, and make all charitable allowance for the mi&s;takes of my brethren. I am &s;atis|fied that you think, or did when you publi&s;hed, that your opinion was right and would bear examination: For
<PB N="85" REF="026990_0084_0FD2B533D88E2200">
otherwi&s;e you would not have &s;ubmitted it to public in&s;pection; in a day &s;o remarkable as this for free en|quiry. Pious frauds will no longer do, my&s;tical di|vinity is going out of vogue; and men in&s;i&s;t now upon plain common &s;en&s;e. Had your di&s;cour&s;e been publi|&s;hed a hundred years ago, a great part of the Divines called Calvini&s;tical would have di&s;liked it, on account of its making GOD the author of &s;in; which although it was Calvin's opinion, yet it has not been univer&s;ally acknowledged by his followers. But there is but little compari&s;on between the light enjoyed one hundred years ago, and the light we enjoy.</P>
<P>We now clearly &s;ee that all the old creeds, con&s;ci|&s;ions of faith &amp;c. are wrong. That to have a di&s;cour&s;e like yours come abroad, in a day like ours, for light and liberty, is &s;trange indeed. Men in our nation have too high a &s;en&s;e of their liberty, to &s;ubmit to doctrine that &s;ets them upon a level with the brutal creation. Such doctrine will do among &s;laves, but not among freemen. You could not expect that any, who knew what it was to be men, or &s;inners; would ever approve of your doctrine. A doctrine which degrades men into brutes, and makes &s;in impo&s;&s;ible to them. I have of|ten thought, that the goodne&s;s of GOD is to be admired, in &s;o ordering of it, that men think nearly as differently from each other as they look: as hereby they are render|ed &s;o much the more nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful to each other, and have the noble&s;t opportunity for the exerci&s;e of char|ity. But it will be thought &s;trange that men devoted to &s;tudy, &s;hould be &s;o extremely wide of each other as we are. And to what can this great difference be attributed, unle&s;s one or the other of us, have been hampered with a &s;y&s;tem? And &s;o have &s;tudied rather to defend &s;ome|thing that we took for truth, without due examination; than to find out what was true.</P>
<P>You may, dear &s;ir, think that I am blinded by bigo|try, and &s;ee only with the eyes of others: but I think none acquainted with me, will have that opinion of me. For thirty years pa&s;t, I have &s;tudied without &s;hackles, as I think; fully convinced that the truth was not to be
<PB N="86" REF="026990_0085_0FD2B50D8C24EEB8">
found among the &s;avings of men; but is rooted in things, I have &s;ought it where, as I apprehend it is only to be found. And when I have di&s;covered it at any time, I have not been afraid to make it known for the good of others; however contrary to prevailing opinions. But do my dear brother, give me leave, without offence, to tell you, that I fear you have taken opinions too much upon tru&s;t; and have layed too much weight upon the &s;ayings of men. If not, how could one of your di&s;cern|ing, &s;o mi&s;take the meaning of the &s;cripture you founded your di&s;cour&s;e upon? How could you con&s;ider &s;in as the effect of the will and agency of GOD? What! &s;in the choice of that being who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity! I have heard it &s;coffingly &s;aid, that 'tis an article of faith in Connecticut, that GOD is the author of &s;in. Becau&s;e the confe&s;&s;ion of faith adopted by the elders and me&s;&s;engers of the Churches, a&s;&s;embled at Saybrook, 1708, &s;ays, GOD's determinate coun&s;el exten|deth it&s;elf even to the fir&s;t fall, and all other &s;ins of an|gels and men, and that not by a bare permi&s;&s;ion. But I did not think, 'till I read your di&s;cour&s;e, that there was a mini&s;ter now in the State that would avow that bla&s;phemous &s;entiment.</P>
<P>How could you &s;ay that GOD orders the occa&s;ion, and withholds influence nece&s;&s;ary to prevent &s;in? which makes &s;in nece&s;&s;ary, and lays the blame at GOD's door! For a deficient cau&s;e in things nece&s;&s;ary, is truely effici|ent.</P>
<P>How could you &s;o limit the knowledge of the Deity, as to &s;uppo&s;e things properly contingent unknowable to him? Surely all things are done contingently in re&s;pect to GOD, which for ought he hath decreed, might with as much po&s;&s;ibility not be as be. But all things which are done by the creatures voluntarily, may as well not be done, as done. Therefore, if GOD hath decreed, that many things &s;hould be done voluntarily, he hath decreed, that they &s;hould be done contingently. The minor is evident, becau&s;e, if the creatures may not as well omit them as do them, they do them not voluntarily, but nece&s;&s;arily. How could you charge &s;in and blame upon
<PB N="87" REF="026990_0086_0FD2B537C5188CD8">
men, meerly for acting voluntarily in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which is evil? Surely the prerogative of a voluntary agent con&s;i&s;teth not in doing that which it de&s;ireth to do; but in liber|ty of choice to do or not to do, this or that, not in free|dom from coercion only, but in freedom from nece&s;&s;ity al&s;o. How could you argue from the nece&s;&s;ary holine&s;s of GOD, that nece&s;&s;ity may con&s;i&s;t with liberty among men; &s;ince he is above and out of all predicaments wherein we are. How could you argue from GOD's right and propriety in all things, that it belongs to him to di&s;po&s;e of the eternal &s;tate of men; in &s;in and damna|tion, according to his good plea&s;ure? we know that by GOD's ab&s;olute and naked power, he can ca&s;t away the whole ma&s;s of mankind; it is not repugnant to &s;ove|reignty: but by that actual power of his, which is al|ways clothed with goodne&s;s and ju&s;tice, he cannot of his plea&s;ure ca&s;t away one. How could you &s;ay, that all men being &s;inners, GOD is not obliged to exerci&s;e his &s;aving mercy towards any? Is he not bound by his de|cree, by his promi&s;e, and by his giving &s;inners of men a law to keep?</P>
<P>How could you adopt the opinion of ab&s;olute elec|tion and reprobation? an opinion which drags after it the mo&s;t ab&s;urd, wicked and bla&s;phemous con&s;equences. Ab&s;olute reprobation being once granted, we may more properly call GOD a father of cruelties, than of mercies; and of hatred rather than of love; and a de&s;troyer of men, rather than the &s;aviour of men. Mr. Fletcher, illu&s;trates this, by a mother that "conceived <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n unac|countable antipathy to her &s;ucking child. She goes to the brink of a precipice, bends her&s;elf over it with the pa&s;&s;ive infant in her bo&s;om, and, withdrawing her arms from under him, drops him upon the craggy &s;ide of a rock, and thus he rolls down from rock to rock, 'till he lies at the bottom beaten to pieces, a bloody in&s;tance of fini&s;hed de&s;truction. The Judge a&s;ks the murderer what &s;he has to &s;ay in her own defence. The child was mine, replies &s;he, and I have a right to do what I plea&s;e with my own. Be&s;ides, I did neither throw him down, nor murder him: I only withdrew my arms from under
<PB N="88" REF="026990_0087_0FD2B50F044C47E0">
him, and he fell of his own accord." Upon your prin|ciples &s;ir, this mother mu&s;t be acquitted with honour; but common &s;en&s;e will condemn the murderer. The&s;e and many other, like &s;entiments in your di&s;cour&s;e, &s;atis|fied me that a gentleman of your di&s;cerning, would never embrace &s;uch opinions, had not your mind been warp'd by the opinions of others. Hence I concluded on reading your di&s;cour&s;e, that you was defending the opinions of other men rather than your own. And &s;eve|ral words and phra&s;es in your di&s;cour&s;e, which I ob&s;er|ved, made me think that you had been mi&s;lead by Mr. Edwards' treati&s;e on the will; than which I know of no book, where &s;o much labour and pains is taken to &s;o little purpo&s;e. I own the book, but have it not now by me, if I had, I would give you a confutation of it in one page, though, as I remember it contains near four hundred. But you may find the &s;inews of Mr. Edwards' arguments out by the ingenious Mr. We&s;t of Newbedford; in an e&s;&s;ay on liberty and nece&s;&s;ity, lately publi&s;hed. What conceivable ab&s;urdity dear &s;ir, can be more &s;hocking to the human mind, not corrupted with a fal&s;e glare of vain &s;cience, than for men to commend or blame them&s;elves, or for others to do it, for what they are no more the cau&s;es of, than of the beating of their pul&s;e, and could no more prevent than the ebbing and flowing of the &s;ea! This plan of fatali&s;m which Mr. Edwards pleads for, and which you have adopted; is wholly the product of metaphy&s;ical &s;ubtility; and in direct contra|diction to the invariable con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s mankind have of a power within them&s;elves to give motion to the facul|ties both of their &s;ouls and bodies. Nay, even tho&s;e who pretend to believe the doctrine of fatal cau&s;alty, directly contradict, by their practical &s;entiments, and in a &s;teady uniform cour&s;e, what they po&s;&s;e&s;s in words. For their whole conduct in life is ju&s;t as theirs is, who really think they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an active &s;elf-moving power, and are the cau&s;es of their own volitions, and the effects con&s;equent upon them. So their practice in life is a confutation of their faith in theory. I be&s;eech you my dear brother to review your whole &s;cheme, turn it upon
<PB N="89" REF="026990_0088_0FD2B53B2C80CAB0">
all &s;ides, trace it in all its con&s;equences; and &s;ee where and to what they will lead you.</P>
<P>I have pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence many things exception|able in your di&s;cour&s;e, becau&s;e I would not be tedious. And things that I have a little examined, I have not pur|&s;ued in there con&s;equences as I might have done. Read dear Sir, the remarks I have made on your di&s;cour&s;e, in the &s;pirit of love. Be a&s;&s;ured that your opponent is not your enemy. If any thing ju&s;tly offen&s;ive has e&s;caped my pen, I will certainly retract it the moment I &s;ee it. If after all you remain of the &s;ame mind, as when you pub|li&s;hed your di&s;cour&s;e, you will doubtle&s;s think that there is &s;omething nece&s;&s;ary now for you to do; in order to defend your di&s;cour&s;e, again&s;t the exceptions I have made to it. I am quite willing you &s;hould do your utmo&s;t to defend your &s;cheme. But you know my dear brother, that there is a certain number of fir&s;t principles, or primary moral truths, which are perceived and a&s;&s;ented to, with|out he&s;itation, by mankind in common; in con&s;equence of that power of di&s;cernment they come into being furn|i&s;hed with, and are the only ba&s;is on which there can be rea&s;oning to any purpo&s;e among men, with relation to the moral &s;y&s;tem. Hence, the further any one proceeds in error the further he departs from tho&s;e primary truths, which form the ba&s;is of rea&s;oning and con&s;equently will be the more ea&s;ily detected. If it is my ca&s;e, that I am in the wrong, as you may likely think; the further I go the weaker I &s;hall grow. And at length become a very ea&s;y tool to deal with. Should this be the ca&s;e, I will rejoice, may the truth but grain ground.</P>
<P>Controver&s;y, though not de&s;irable in it &s;elf, yet pro|perly managed, has often times re&s;cued truth groaning under the la&s;h of triumphant error. To pay a &s;trict at|tention to the thing, or object in di&s;pute, and u&s;e no other artillery again&s;t an adver&s;ary, than &s;oft words and hard arguments, is generally the be&s;t way to manage a di&s;pute. If you &s;hould write again in defence of your &s;cheme, whatever you advance, that is argumentative and to the point, you may depend upon my careful, and I hope candid examination; &s;hould it plea&s;e GOD to &s;pare life
<PB N="90" REF="026990_0089_0FD2B53C0F5648E8">
and continue health. But any thing that is other|wi&s;e I &s;hall treat with &s;ilence.</P>
<P>But as wide as we now are in opinion from each other, what hinders our being one in love? Let us my dear brother, notwith&s;tanding our difference in opinion, love one another out of a pure heart fervently, as the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t directs. Con&s;tantly praying for each other, that the GOD of patience and con&s;olation would grant us to be like minded, one towards another according to Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
