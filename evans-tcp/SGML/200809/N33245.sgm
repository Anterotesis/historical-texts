<P>IF any &s;hould &s;ay of me, as Dr. Mayhew &s;aid of Mr. John Cleveland, viz. "An ob&s;cure per&s;on, of little note," I have only to &s;ay, that thereby I have greatly the advantage. The low trees in the valleys, are not &s;o expo&s;ed to winds, and hurricanes, as the tall trees on the mountains.</P>
<P>If any &s;hould &s;ay, that the following performance, is an in|correct, inelegant, homely piece, I &s;hall only &s;ay, that a wi&s;e man never de&s;pi&s;es whole&s;ome food, becau&s;e it is &s;erved up in an homely di&s;h. Such as it is, I venture to &s;end it forth for thy careful peru&s;al: And de&s;ire nothing more of thee, than that thou &s;houlde&s;t impartially, and candidly, compare what Mr. Fo&s;ter delivered, and what I have &s;aid again&s;t it, with the word of God; and as truth turns the &s;cale in thy mind, &s;o let thy practice be conformable thereto.</P>
<P>Mi&s;takes in the effentials of religion while in this life, may prove fatal to us in the world to come. Therefore, it is of the highe&s;t concern, that we dig deep, and lay our foundation upon a rock; even the rock Chri&s;t Je&s;us: And not tru&s;t to our doing much towards our own &s;alvation; that if ever we are aved, we mu&s;t work it out. And it will be but a cold com|fort, to gracele&s;s church-members, when they &s;hall cry, Lord, Lord, we have eat, and drank, in thy pre&s;ence, &amp;c.

<HEAD>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE CALLED STANDING CHURCHES, AND THOSE CALLED STRICT CONGREGATIONALISTS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been thought by many, that di&s;putes in matters of religion, have been hurtful thereto; and from thence have rejected all di&s;putes in religious affairs. Although, I be|lieve, that many controver&s;ies in religious affairs, where ma&s;|tery has been &s;ought, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tended much to de&s;troy vital piety, and godline&s;s; yet, I believe, that many controver&s;ies that have been in the chri&s;tian church, have tended greatly to clear &s;ome truths, that have been in the chri&s;tian church, and hath made them appear more bright and glorious, than ever they would as yet, if they had never been di&s;puted. As for in|&s;tance, Athei&s;m, and Dei&s;m, that have been advanced in the world, have produced arguments again&s;t them, that have made the being of God, and the truth of divine revelation, appear in a very glorious light. And &s;o it has been, re&s;pecting how much &s;inners can do towards their &s;alvation by works of their own: And al&s;o who have right to church member&s;hip, and the &s;pecial ordinances of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Having had opportunity to read a &s;enmon, and a charge, delivered by Mr. I&s;aac Fo&s;ter, and the right hand of fellow|&s;hip, delivered by Mr. Ruffel, at the ordination of Mr. Emer|&s;on Fo&s;ter, in Killingly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ociety, 22d day of January, A. D. 1778; I thought there was a fit opportunity pre&s;ented, to an&s;wer a que&s;tion that has been a&s;ked by many, in the&s;e late years, viz. What is the difference, between tho&s;e called Standing Churches, and tho&s;e called Separates, (or a the law of this State hath termed them, Strict Congregationali&s;ts?) 
<PB N="4" REF="043597_0004_101D5A510833B370">
And this I &s;hall attempt, by making &s;ome remarks upon &s;aid &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mon, charge, and right-hand of fellow&s;hip; and then give the reader a &s;hort account, of the &s;entiments of the &s;eparate churches, &s;o far as it re&s;pects gathering churches, and church government; by which the difference may be &s;een, and &s;o people will need to a&s;k the que&s;tion no more. And,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. With re&s;pect to &s;aid &s;ermon, I &s;hall only remark the deficiency in it. The text laid a proper foundation, to have &s;hewn, how mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, come by the word of the Lord that they a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to preach, or &s;peak to the people; but this is in|tirely neglected, and only a few hints given, how the faithful preacher, will preach faithfully: And &s;o people are left in the dark, as to what makes a go&s;pel mini&s;ter; whether it is Chri&s;t, or human learning, or both, or whether it is Pope, Bi&s;hop, Pre&s;bytery, or A&s;&s;ociation. But,</P>
<P>Secondly, I &s;hall take notice and con&s;ider &s;ome things hand|ed out by Mr. F. in his charge to his &s;on. <Q>Always oppo&s;e in your preaching, (faith he) that wicked, abominable opi|nion, that prevails in the country at this day, viz. That the unregenerate can do nothing but &s;in;&mdash;nothing that will, in the lea&s;t, forward their eternal &s;alvation: That all their en|deavours can only aggravate guilt.</Q> This then is what he calls wicked and abominable. But let us examine what he calls wicked and abominable, and &s;ee if they are not &s;ome of the great truths of God, revealed in his word to lo&s;t &s;inners. Chri&s;t hath told us, that, <Q>a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit; neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</Q> The apo&s;tle faith, <Q>The carnal mind, is enmity again&s;t God, is not &s;ub|ject to his law, neither indeed can be.</Q> Further, God hath &s;aid of man, that, <Q>Every imagination of the thoughts of his heart, was only evil continually.</Q> I know of no medium, be|tween a &s;tate of nature, and a &s;tate of grace; &mdash; between a &s;tate of entire enmity again&s;t God, and a &s;tate of reconciliation with God. An unregenerate per&s;on, is in a &s;tate of depraved na|ture, at enmity with God, every part, power, and faculty of his &s;oul, fixt again&s;t God, and in oppo&s;ition to his law. And i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> impo&s;&s;ible that he can perform one act of obedience out of love to God; and love to God is what he requires, of all ra|tional 
<PB N="5" REF="043597_0005_101D5A52A4E121B0">
beings, in order to their &s;ervices being acceptable to him. And is it po&s;&s;ible that a child of the devil, and enemy of God, can do any thing but &s;in again&s;t God? We are told in God's word, that their plowing is &s;in, and their &s;acrifices an abomination. But Mr. F. hath implicitly charged his &s;on, to tell &s;inner, that they can do &s;ome hing be&s;ides &s;in; that is, that they can perform &s;ome holy actions: For there is no me|dium between &s;in, and holine&s;s. Chri&s;t hath determined the point, that a corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit. And therefore, he hath charged his &s;on, to preach directly again&s;t the word of God. I do not mean to be under&s;tood, that there is no actions done by &s;inners, that are con&s;idered ab&s;tractly in them&s;elves, but what is &s;in; far from it: But then con&s;idered, as the &s;inners acts, they are all wrapt up in &s;in. This was the ca&s;e with Jehu, he did right in executing God's wrath, upon the hou&s;e of Ahab: And yet God declared by the prophet, that the days &s;hould come, when he would avenge the blood of Jezreel, upon the hou&s;e of Jehu. And why? Becau&s;e, Jehu did not act from a principle of love to God; but with a mur|derous mind; and therefore it was all &s;in in him. Hear what that great divine, Mr. Bo&s;ton, hath &s;aid to this point; his words are the&s;e, <Q>Object. But God is a merciful God, and he knows we are not able to an&s;wer the&s;e demands; we hope therefore to be &s;aved if do as well as we can, and keep the commands as well as we are able. An&s;. Though thou art able to do many things, thou art not able to do one thing aright; thou can&s;t do nothing acceptable to God: John xv 5. Without me you can do nothing. An unrenewed man, as thou art, can do nothing but &s;in, as we have al|ready evinced. Thy be&s;t actions are &s;in, and &s;o they increa&s;e thy debt to ju&s;tice.</Q> Dr. Gill, in his &s;ermon upon the pre|&s;ent &s;tate of the church, faith, <Q>There is no good thing in unregenerate men, and therefore no good thing can come out of them; they have no true knowledge of that which is good, and much le&s;s to do it; they have no inclination or de&s;ire, nay, an aver&s;ion to it; they have no free will there|unto, nor power to perform; it may as rea&s;onably be ex|pected to gather grapes of thorns, or figs of th&s;tles, as good 
<PB N="6" REF="043597_0006_101D5A55475C6640">
works to be done by an evil man; a wicked man is to every good work reprobate and unfit. A man mu&s;t fir&s;t be a good man before he can do good works; men begin at the wrong end, when they propo&s;e to do good works, in order to make them&s;elves good men; the fir&s;t concern &s;hould be to have a good work of grace upon the heart, which is the Lord's work; the tree mu&s;t fir&s;t be made good, ere the fruit will be good.</Q></P>
<P>Now if what has been &s;aid, will &s;tand for truth, as it mo&s;t certainly will, then it will determine the two next particulars. That &s;inners can do nothing, that will forward their eternal &s;alvation: That all their endeavours can only aggravate guilt. For how is it po&s;&s;ible, if the unregenerate can do nothing but &s;in, that it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e? It is only increa&s;ing their debt to ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Further, Mr. F. charges his &s;on to tell &s;inners, <Q>They can do much towards their own &s;alvation:&mdash;That if ever they are &s;aved, they mu&s;t work it out.</Q> Now, I conceive that the &s;alvation of &s;inners, con&s;i&s;ts in the&s;e two things, the pay|ment of their debt to ju&s;tice, and a real change of heart, from &s;in to holine&s;s. Without the&s;e two things being done, for, and in, &s;inners, they can never be &s;aved. Now, where is the &s;on or daughter of Adam, that can do much towards pay|ing his debt to ju&s;tice; or changing his heart, from &s;in to ho|line&s;s? If they can do much, I pray how much? Can they do half, or two thirds? If &s;o, why not all, as well as much? And &s;o con&s;equently, Chri&s;t is dead in vain. The word of God hath taught us, that the &s;alvation of &s;inners, mu&s;t be all by works; or all by grace; there is no mixing them together. See Rom. iv. 4, 5. and chap. xi. 6. <Q>Now to him that worketh, is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that ju&s;tifi|eth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteou&s;ne&s;s. And if by grace, then it is no more of works; otherwi&s;e grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more of grace; otherwi&s;e work is no more work.</Q></P>
<P>But Mr. F. &s;ays, <Q>According to God's gracious con&s;tituti|on, they can do much towards their own &s;alvation,</Q> &amp;c. 
<PB N="7" REF="043597_0007_101D5A58063C1990">
But let us inquire into this affair, and &s;ee how much a &s;inner can do, even under the gracious con&s;titution of the go&s;pel. The apo&s;tle &s;ums up the whole of his preaching, in tho&s;e few, but comprehen&s;ive expre&s;&s;ions, viz. <Q>Repentance towards God; and faith towards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q> Now, it is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;alvation of &s;inners, even under the gracious con&s;titution of the go&s;pel, that &s;inners repent, and be|lieve the go&s;pel; and that repentance, and faith, that are of a &s;aving nature, are both the work of God's &s;pirit upon the &s;ouls of men: And they are as unable to repent, and believe the go&s;pel, as they are to &s;atisfy the law by works of their own; for if they could do much towards repentance, and faith, of them&s;elves, then &s;alvation would not be all by free grace, from the foundation to the top &s;tone. I wonder, how much Mr. F. thinks the Ephe&s;ian believers did towards their own &s;alvation, that the apo&s;tle faith, were dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins; and that it was God that quickened them; and that it was by grace they were &s;aved, through faith, and that not of them|&s;elves, but it was the gift of God. The bible hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> told &s;inners, that they can do much towards their own &s;alvati|on; but the rever&s;e, that it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runeth, but of God, that &s;heweth mercy. And that it is God, that mu&s;t work in us both to will, and to do, or we never &s;hall be &s;aved. See the opinion of the A&s;&s;embly of Di|vines at We&s;tmin&s;ter, upon this point. Con&s;i&s;s. chap. IX. fect. III. <Q>Man by his fall, into a &s;tate of &s;in, hath wholly lo&s;t all ability of will, to any &s;piritual good, accompanying &s;alvation; &s;o as a natural man, being altogether aver&s;e from that good, and dead in &s;in, is not able by his own &s;trength, to convert him&s;elf, or to prepare him&s;elf thereunto.</Q> Thus, I think Mr. F's. opinion, is not &s;criptural, nor calvini&s;tical; but a motley mixture of works and grace, and contrary to the opinion of the mo&s;t found orthodox Divines, that have wrote upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Mr F. &s;eems to in&s;inuate, as if the opinion he oppo&s;es, is &s;ome new opinion, that is prevailing in the country at this day. But he is mi&s;taken: It is the good old opinion, that has been held ever &s;ince there was a church on earth. Nor will I &s;ay, 
<PB N="8" REF="043597_0008_101D5A598E11BEE0">
that his opinion is a new opinion, though I am &s;orry to &s;ee it prevailing in the country, at this day. It is as old as Caln's day, he attempted to do <HI>much</HI> towards his own &s;alvation, by bringing the product of his own labour, an offering, to appea&s;e an offended Deity; and it was as good an offering, as any un|regenerate per&s;on ever brought to God &s;ince.</P>
<P>Mr. F. charges his &s;on, to <Q>&s;top the mouths of the&s;e unruly and vain talkers and deceivers.</Q> But pray, who are the&s;e vain, and unruly talkers, who mu&s;t have their mouths &s;topt? Why, horrid to think! they are Chri&s;t, and his apo&s;tles, and prophets; and not only &s;o, but that venerable A&s;&s;embly of Di|vines at We&s;tmin&s;ter, with a cloud of calvini&s;t writers. But he has &s;et his &s;on an hard to&s;k, that he never will accompli&s;h in this world, and I am &s;ure he will be of a different opinion from his father, when he arrives at the world to come.</P>
<P>There is one thing more, that Mr. F. calls a wicked opinion, viz. <Q>That the unregenerate can do nothing that has any more tendency to holine&s;s, than the exerci&s;e of lu&s;t.</Q> Which is an opinion I never heard of before, in them terms, and therefore I &s;hall leave it as I found it.</P>
<P>Furthermore, Mr. F. has told his &s;on, that, <Q>Bapti&s;m is the only badge of church member&s;hip, appointed by Chri&s;t.</Q> And from thence has directed him, <Q>to baptize all tho&s;e chil|dren that are born of baptized parents, or who&s;e ance&s;tors were in covenant with God.</Q> Upon which I would &s;ay, that although I am fully per&s;uaded in the doctrine of hou&s;hold bapti&s;m, yet I am very different in my opinion from Mr. F. in what he has &s;aid.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, In what he has &s;aid re&s;pecting bapti&s;m's being the on|ly badge of church member&s;hip.&mdash;As the word <HI>baage</HI> &s;ignifies a cognizance, or coat of arms, and as cognizance &s;ignifies knowledge, or a privilege which a corporation has to hold a plea, &amp;c. It will follow, from Mr. F's. principle, that all baptized per&s;ons, have a right to claim full privilege of mem|ber&s;hip in the church of Chri&s;t: Or in other words, that they are members of the vi&s;ible church. Bapti&s;m I allow to be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to member&s;hip in the vi&s;ible church; but not the only badge of church member&s;hip. Is a per&s;on baptized in the 
<PB N="9" REF="043597_0009_101D5A5B1DCA2110">
church of Rome, known to be a member of the church of Chri&s;t? Are children baptized in the half-way covenant, known to be members of the church of Chri&s;t? Surely, they are not more in the church, than their parents were which got them baptized; which were but half-way in. Suppo&s;e a Jew|i&s;h prie&s;t had wandered from home, and got among the Mo|abites, and Amorites, and had fallen to circumci&s;ing their children: Would they thereby be known to be members of the vi&s;ible church? Are all tho&s;e per&s;ons baptized by the Se|parate and Bapti&s;t mini&s;ters, cognized members of the vi&s;ible church? Surely Mr. F. won't allow it. Neither do I think that he believes his own a&s;&s;ertion. It would be difficult to prove from the bible, that the primary de&s;ign of the in&s;titution of cir|cumci&s;ion, or bapti&s;m, was to be the only badge of church member&s;hip; or even to be a badge of church member&s;hip to all upon whom them ordinances were admini&s;tered. Dr. Owen &s;aith, that in order to our being known to be members of Chri&s;t's vi&s;ible church, it is nece&s;&s;ary, <Q>That every man's own voluntary con&s;ent, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the ordinances of Chri&s;t in that church whereunto he is joined, is required for his union therewith, and fellow&s;hip therein.</Q> If bapti&s;m is the only badge, by which the church of Chri&s;t, and its mem|bers, are known; then the Prote&s;tant church of Scotland long ago, were mi&s;taken in their notes, by which the church of Chri&s;t is known; which they avow, and affirm to be, <Q>Fir&s;t, The true preaching of the word of God&mdash;Secondly, The right admini&s;tration of the &s;acraments of Chri&s;t Je&s;us&mdash; Thirdly, Eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline, uprightly mini&s;tred, as God's word pre&s;cribeth; whereby vice is repre&s;&s;ed, and virtue nouri&s;hed.</Q> But,</P>
<P>Secondly, If what Mr. F. has &s;aid, <Q>That all tho&s;e chil|dren that are born of baptized parents, or who&s;e ance&s;ters were in covenant with God,</Q> are to be baptized, then it will follow, that there is not a per&s;on on earth, of the human race, but what are proper &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m. If we may go back four generations, I &s;ee not why we may not go back a thou&s;and generations; and as all men de&s;cended from pious Noah, that was in covenant with God, &s;o all men have an equal right to bapti&s;m. I &s;uppo&s;e, that it was upon this prin|ciple, that the Spani&s;h mi&s;&s;ionaries drove the Mexico Indians, 
<PB N="10" REF="043597_0010_101D5A5D713E4ED8">
&s;word in hand, into the water, by thou&s;ands in a drove, and baptized them; or declared them to be baptized&mdash;And it &s;eems by the manner of Mr. F.'s delivering him&s;elf to his &s;on, in this affair, as if he intended he &s;hould baptize all he could lay hands upon, willing or unwilling, a&s;ked or una&s;ked. But as his opinion in his affair has no foundation in the word of God, and as it has been &s;o &s;ully refuted, by the learned Mr. Bo&s;ton, it will be needle&s;s for me to add.</P>
<P>I proceed, in the next place, to take notice, and con&s;ider, tho&s;e words in the charge. <Q>Ever reject that church-de&s;troy|ing opinion, that makes grace a term of communion in the vi&s;ible church; which opinion has no foot-&s;teps in the word of God, nor was ever known in the church, till that man of &s;in aro&s;e, who&s;e coming was after the working of &s;atan, with all &s;igns and lying wonders.</Q></P>
<P>When I fir&s;t read the&s;e words, I was a&s;toni&s;hed that any man in this day of great light, &s;hould be &s;o bold as to tread under foot, not only the word of God, but the opinion of great, learned, and pious divines, that have wrote upon the &s;ubject, and have demon&s;trated from the word of God, and from the nature of the ordinance of the Lord's &s;upper, the nece&s;&s;ity of grace in order to a due attendance thereupon, who&s;e little|fingers were thicker in divinity, than Mr. F.'s loins. But when I came to con&s;ider the affair, I was &s;atisfied that God, in his providence, &s;o ordered it, that upon &s;o public an occa|&s;ion, the real &s;entiments of our &s;tanding churches, (as they are called) &s;hould be brought out to public view. I take it for granted, that as Mr. F. was appointed by the venerable coun|cil, that a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the ordination, to be their mouth in giving the charge, that he &s;pake their minds, e&s;pecially as none of them objected to what he &s;aid; and therefore, it may ju&s;tly be &s;aid, that all tho&s;e mini&s;ters, and churches, that a&s;&s;i&s;ted in &s;aid ordination, hold to, and profe&s;s, the &s;ame principles that Mr. F. advanced, (though I hope, and charitably believe, that not all who are called &s;tanding churches, and mini&s;ters, hold &s;uch un&s;criptural opinions; yet I have rea&s;on to fear, they are very &s;carce.) Thus, I think, that venerable council, have ingenuou&s;ly publi&s;hed their &s;entiments to the world, &s;o that from this time forward, we need not a&s;k them what their &s;entiments are in the above particulars.</P>

I proceed therefore, to give &s;ome evidence of what I have &s;aid&mdash;That Mr. F. in a&s;&s;erting, that grace is not a nece&s;&s;ary term of communion in the vi&s;ible church, hath trodden under foot, not only the word of God, but the writings of &s;ome of the greate&s;t divines. And</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The &s;criptures, in giving the characters of the mem|bers of Chri&s;t's vi&s;ible church, every where &s;peak the rever&s;e of his opinion. I &s;hall name a few of them. P&s;alm xv. 1, 2. Lord, who &s;hall abide in thy tabernacle? Who &s;hall dwell in thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;peaketh the truth in his heart.&mdash;P&s;alm xxiv. 3, 4. Who &s;hall a&s;cend into the hill of the Lord? And who &s;hall &s;tand in his holy place? He that hath clean hand and a pure heart."&mdash;From which it may be &s;een, that truth in the heart, or heart purity, was nece&s;&s;ary even in the old te&s;tament times, for tho&s;e that would dwell <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> holy hill. And it always was, and always will be, a truth, that without <HI>faith</HI> it|is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God. So Rom. i. 7. To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be &s;aints. I Cor. i. 2. Unte the church of God, which is at Corinth, to them that are &s;anc|tified in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, called to be &s;aints. Eph. i. 1. To the &s;aints which are at Ephe&s;us, and to the faithful in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Heb. iii. 1. Wherefore holy brethren, partakers of the hea|venly calling. I Peter, ii. 5. Ye al&s;o as lively &s;tones, are built up a &s;piritual hou&s;e, an holy prie&s;thood, to offer up &s;pi|ritual &s;acrifices, &amp;c. All which &s;criptures hold forth, not on|ly the nece&s;&s;ity of grace, but the profe&s;&s;ion of grace, by &s;uch as were members of Chri&s;t's vi&s;ible church.&mdash;Now, with what propriety gracele&s;s per&s;ons, by their own profe&s;&s;ion children of the devil, can be called faints, holy brethren, and lively &s;tones, is beyond me to explain. But,</P>
<P>Secondly, The &s;criptures that &s;peak of the union, between Chri&s;t and his church, all &s;uppo&s;e grace as nece&s;&s;ary to that union. Read the whole book of Canticles; and many ex|pre&s;&s;ions in the prophets, as, I am married unto you, faith the Lord&mdash;Thy Maker is thy hu&s;band, the Lord of Ho&s;t is his name. All which &s;uppo&s;e, that there was not only an inward union, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the Lord, and his church; but a vi|&s;ible covenant relation, wherein the church had profe&s;&s;ed to be a cha&s;te virgin, e&s;pou&s;ed to one hu&s;band, even Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="043597_0012_101D5A63F2129E68">
So the near union between the members of Chri&s;t's vi&s;ible body, &s;uppo&s;es grace as nece&s;&s;ary to that union, The apo&s;tle compares the church of Chri&s;t to the human body; and tells us it was knit together in <HI>love.</HI> Now, if the &s;aving grace of love, or true charity, is not nece&s;&s;ary to be in the church in this world, in order for its union, and communion; or if Chri&s;t can be plea&s;ed with a gracele&s;s bride, in this world; I &s;ee not, why he may not have a church in <HI>hell,</HI> where hatred reigns, and be well plea&s;ed with it; e&s;pecially when (accord|ing to Mr. F.) he &s;ees them have the only badge of church member&s;hip. But the apo&s;tle hath fully &s;ettled the point, in telling us, <Q>That our fellow&s;hip is with the Father, and his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and one with another.</Q> That is, that fel|low&s;hip, or union with God, in Chri&s;t, is that, that lays a foundation, for our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> fellow&s;hip one with another, in his church in this world. Again,</P>
<P>Thirdly, The expre&s;s command of God forbids gracele&s;s member&s;hip, and communion, in his vi&s;ible church. See Ezek. xliv. 7, 8, 9. In that ye have brought into my &s;anctuary, &s;trangers, uncircumci&s;ed in <HI>heart,</HI> and uncircumci&s;ed in fle&s;h, to be in my <HI>&s;anctuary,</HI> to pollute it. And ye have not kept the <HI>charge</HI> of my holy things. <HI>Thus &s;aith the LORD,</HI> no &s;tran|ger, <HI>uncircumci&s;ed in HEART,</HI> nor uncircumci&s;ed in fle&s;h, &s;hall <HI>enter into my &s;anctuary.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall, in the next place, cite &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages, out of &s;ome of the mo&s;t approved divines, that &s;peak very different from Mr. F. in the point now under con&s;ideration. <HI>Ur&s;in,</HI> upon the que&s;tion, Who ought to come to the &s;upper? tells us,
<Q>The &s;acraments are appointed, for the faithful and converted only, to &s;eal the promi&s;es of the go&s;pel to them, and to con|firm their faith.</Q> And further he &s;aith, <Q>That God com|mands to all the u&s;e of the &s;acraments, yet the lawful u&s;e, which is not without faith and repentance.</Q> Mr. Bo&s;ton, in his &s;ermon upon the union of the body of Chri&s;t, faith, <Q>It is not in your power to know certainly, and infallibly, who are real members of this body; but the vi&s;ible body of Chri&s;t, is made up of &s;aints by profe&s;&s;ion; and as &s;uch, they admitted to the Lord's table, upon their de&s;ire.</Q> The pi|ous Mr. Willi&s;on, in his &s;acramental catechi&s;m, has this que|&s;tion, <Q>Ought all who come to the Lord's table, to have &s;av|ing

grace, as nece&s;&s;ary to qualify them for it? Ao&s;. Yes; for without &s;aving grace in the heart, we are uncapable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hold communion with God, or of putting forth tho&s;e act<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> faith, love, and repentance, which are nece&s;&s;ary in partak|ing of this ordinance.</Q> The late Mr. Edwards, has de|mon&s;trated the nece&s;&s;ity of grace, in order for church commu|nion, in &s;uch a light, that all his opponents, have not been able to gain-&s;ay his arguments, from &s;cripture or rea&s;on. The Prote&s;tant church of Scotland, in their confe&s;&s;ion of faith, &s;ay,

<P>I will tran&s;cribe a few articles, from the confe&s;&s;ion of faith, of the <HI>Vaudois</HI> churches, in the vallies of Piedmont; which churches are ge|nerally allowed to have kept neare&s;t to the primitive &s;tandard, in the dark days of popery, of any churches in the world.
<Q>Art. 24. That God hath gathered together a church in the world, for the &s;alvation of mankind. Art. 25. That this church is the company of the faithful, who being elected of God, before the foundation of the world, and called by an holy vocation, are united together for to follow the word of God, believing that which he teaches, and living in his fear. Art. 30. That he has in&s;tituted his holy &s;upper, for the nouri&s;hment of our &s;ouls, to the end, that by a true and lively faith, by the incomprehen&s;ible virtue of the Holy Gho&s;t, eating effectively his fle&s;h, and drinking his blood, and uniting us mo&s;t in&s;eparably to Chri&s;t, in him, and by him, we may have eternal life.</Q>&mdash;Dr. Hugh Knox, in his e&s;&s;ay upon a preparation for the Lord's &s;upper, faith, <Q>It is evident, from the very nature and de&s;ign of this ordinance, that it belongs only to true di&s;ciples, and real chri&s;tians. It is a nouri&s;hing ordinance; but &s;uch only can be nouri&s;hed who have life: Be&s;ides, the grace of faith, love, hope, &amp;c. which are properly exerci&s;ed in this ordinance, can only be exerci&s;ed by real, living chri&s;tians. It is a &s;olemn renewal of our covenant with God; but how can they renew a cove|nant which they never entered into at all? How can &s;uch as are in league with the devil and their lu&s;ts, be &s;aid to en|ter into covenant with God? What &s;incerity can there be in &s;uch a tran&s;action as this! Does it not imply the mo&s;t in&s;o|lent, bare-faced mockery.</Q>&mdash; 
<PB N="14" REF="043597_0014_101D5A6A482A87C8">
Thus, reader, you have a fair opportunity of judging for your&s;elf, whether Mr. F. is not criminally guilty, in a&s;&s;erting, that grace, as a term of communion in the vi&s;ible church, has no foot&s;teps in the word of God; but took its ri&s;e from the man of &s;in.</P>
<P>I remember, not many years &s;ince, in conver&s;ation with an eminent mini&s;ter, in one of the &s;tanding churches, to have a&s;k|ed him, how far he extended his communion? His an&s;wer was, to all that make the chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion. I a&s;ked him if he held communion with tho&s;e churches, that held, that grace was not nece&s;&s;ary for member&s;hip in the vi&s;ible church? His an&s;wer was, no, no more than he would with infidels. I a&s;k|ed him why? His an&s;wer was, becau&s;e they did not make the chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion. And for my part, I never could find a church in all the bible, that was built upon a gracele&s;s pro|fe&s;&s;ion, that ever God owned for his vi&s;ible church. There|fore, with a little variation from Mr. F's. words, I would &s;ay, that his opinion of gracele&s;s communion, has no foot-&s;teps in the word of God: Nor was ever known in the church, till error aro&s;e, and taught that works were meritorious.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that hold to gracele&s;s communion, make u&s;e of the tares, and wheat, growing together, to prove their opinion: But &s;top, reader, a minute, and pau&s;e upon the parable, and a&s;k, who &s;owed them tares among the wheat? Did God &s;ow them; or even order them to be &s;owed? No, it was the devil that &s;owed them, while men &s;lept. And may we not ju&s;tly &s;ay, that all who plead for gracele&s;s communion, are <HI>advocates</HI> for the <HI>devil,</HI> and labouring to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his work?</P>
<P>I always thought, when we give a mini&s;ter a charge, we ought to take the &s;ame from the word of God; but that part of Mr. F's. charge, that re&s;pects gracele&s;s communion, was ne|ver taken from the word of God; and I am humbly of the opinion, was the fir&s;t that ever was delivered in them terms, &s;ince there was a church on earth.</P>
<P>I only add, that as there is no difference, between the church militant, and the church triumphant, as to the nature of their union, and communion, only in the degree of it, I &s;ee not, why gracele&s;s &s;inners may not be as capable of holding com|munion with the church triumphant, as with the church mili|tant. The church militant is &s;aid to be one body, and one
<PB N="15" REF="043597_0015_101D5A6E449A0A20">
bread&mdash;one body and one &s;pirit; and if &s;inners are capable of being one body, and one bread&mdash;one body, and one &s;pirit, with the &s;aints in this life, why not in the life to come? Eve|ry argument that might be brought, to bar &s;inners out of hea|ven, might be u&s;ed with equal force, to bar them out of the church on earth. I do not mean to be under&s;tood, that I think there ever will be a pure church on earth: But I mean, as Mr. Bo&s;ton has well &s;aid, that unregenerate per&s;ons, are no more of the body of Chri&s;t in reality, than a wooden leg is part of the human body. I proceed,</P>
<P>La&s;tly, To con&s;ider tho&s;e words in the right-hand of fellow|&s;hip, viz. <Q>It is with real plea&s;ure, that we once more behold a candle lighted in this golden candle-&s;tick.</Q> The fir&s;t thing that came into my mind, when I read the&s;e words, was, that it was calling things by wrong names. I &s;uppo&s;e that the young gentleman, was of the &s;ame opinion with his honoured father, that gave him his charge; and the church over which he was ordained, was agreed with them in their principle of gracele&s;s communion. Now, it is beyond me to comprehend, how &s;uch a church can, with propriety, be called a golden candle-&s;tick. They are not &s;o by profe&s;&s;ion, but the rever&s;e; they profe&s;s, that gold is not nece&s;&s;ary, in building the church of Chri&s;t: Or in other words, that grace, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a term of com|munion, or member&s;hip among them, is a church-de&s;troying opinion, that took its ri&s;e from the man of &s;in. Were I to give the right-hand of fellow&s;hip to a mini&s;ter, and church, that held grace as a term of communion, a church-de&s;troying opinion, it &s;hould be conceived in the following terms, viz. That it is with real &s;orrow of heart, that we once more behold a gracele&s;s mini&s;ter, &s;it in this gracele&s;s church, (&s;o by their own profe&s;&s;ion) a blind leader of the blind, that are in danger of falling into the ditch together.</P>
<P>It may be thought by &s;ome, that I reject all that was &s;aid in the &s;ermon, charge, and right-hand of fellow&s;hip. Far from it; many things were excellently well &s;aid. But tho&s;e things that I have remarked upon, e&s;pecially in the charge, I take to be very poi&s;onous. Neither would I be thought to in&s;inuate, that there is no real &s;aints in &s;uch churches, as hold to grace|le&s;s communion. But then they are not vi&s;ible &s;aints, nor do they have communion with the churches that they belong to, 
<PB N="16" REF="043597_0016_101D5A70D6DCA940">
as the body of Chri&s;t; but live a lonely life, as to the commu|nion of &s;aints, except it be in a private manner.</P>
<P>Thus, reader, I have made tho&s;e remarks that I purpo&s;ed, upon the proceedings of the fore&s;aid ordination. And that you may have a clear view of the difference, between tho&s;e mini&s;ters, and churches, that a&s;&s;i&s;ted in &s;aid ordination, and tho&s;e church|es called &s;trict congregationali&s;ts, I will repre&s;ent them to you, in the following manner, by &s;itting the one over again&s;t the other.</P>

<P N="1">I &s;hall, in the next place, give a &s;hort account of the &s;enti|ments, or principles, of the Separates, (&s;o called) &s;o far as it re&s;pects gathering churches, and church government.</P>
<P N="1">I. As to a confe&s;&s;ion of faith, and platform of church go|vernment, we are generally agreed, in We&s;tmin&s;ter confe&s;&s;ion of faith, and Cambridge platform of church di&s;cipline (with &s;ome few exceptions.) But then, we look upon no human compo&s;ures of divine authority, no further than they agree ex|actly with the word of God. And therefore we believe, that the word of God, contained in the &s;criptures, of the old, and new te&s;tament, to be the only uncring rule of faith and practice.</P>
<P N="2">II. We believe, that where there is a competent number of vi&s;ible profe&s;&s;ing &s;aints, &s;o &s;ituated in the providence of God, as that they can conveniently meet together; and other cir|cum&s;tances of providence concurring, to make duty plain, have a good right to embody together, in a church &s;tate, without any re&s;pect to town, or pari&s;h lines.</P>
<P N="3">III. That the manner of their embodying together, ought to be, by a declaration of each other, of a work of God's grace upon their &s;ouls&mdash;And a &s;pecial re&s;pect, ought al&s;o to be had, to the fruits of grace, that will certainly di&s;cover them&s;elves, in the life and conver&s;ation of true believers. And they ought al&s;o, to enter into a voluntary covenant to walk together, in all the laws, ordinances, and in&s;titutions of the go&s;pel; and to be &s;ubject to the di&s;cipline of his kingdom. And the&s;e rules ought to be ob&s;erved in all after admi&s;&s;ions into their &s;ociety.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="18" REF="043597_0018_101D5A76A2079BE0">
IV. We believe, that a competent number of vi&s;ible pro|fe&s;&s;ing &s;aints, thus embodying, and covenanting together, are a vi&s;ible church of Chri&s;t; and have good right, full power, and lawful authority, delegated to them, by Chri&s;t their law|ful head, to act, and tran&s;act; every thing within them&s;elves, that is nece&s;&s;ary to their well-being, as a church of Chri&s;t, viz. To admit their own members; and reject them in ca&s;e of &s;in unrepented of&mdash;To try, prove, and examine their own can|didates for the mini&s;try&mdash;To chu&s;e them into office; and to put them into office by ordination; and to depo&s;e them from office&s;hip, in ca&s;e of &s;in, by which their office&s;hip is forfeited.</P>
<P N="5">V. We believe, that as a church is a free voluntary &s;ociety, and ought to be in bondage to no man, in matters of religion; that as they have right to chu&s;e their own mini&s;ters, &s;o it is their duty to &s;upport them, without ever making u&s;e of civil law for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">VI. We believe, that brethren in church covenant together, ought never, in any ordinary ca&s;es, to go to law with one another, while they remain in that relation together.</P>
<P N="7">VII. We believe, that all tho&s;e gifts of prayer, exhortation, or preaching, that are in the church; and are approved by the church; ought to be improved in the church, in their proper place, for the edification of the church, which is the body of Chri&s;t in a my&s;tery.</P>
<P>Thus, reader, I have gone throngh with what I propo&s;ed, in &s;hewing the difference between tho&s;e called Standing Churches, and tho&s;e called Strict Congregationali&s;ts, by which I think the difference may be &s;een; and &s;o the que&s;tion may be determined in peoples minds.</P>
<P>Therefore, I &s;hall conclude this &s;mall piece, by an&s;wering &s;ome objections; and making &s;ome reflections upon the fore|going remarks; and &s;ome addre&s;&s;es to &s;everal &s;orts of per&s;ons, or profe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid re&s;pecting &s;inners being unable to do any thing but &s;in, I fore&s;ee that &s;ome objections will ari&s;e. As fir&s;t. If &s;inners be under an utter inability to do any good, how can God require it of them? &amp;c. I find this objection &s;tated by Mr. Bo&s;ton, and therefore I will an&s;wer it in his words, viz. God made man upright, gave him a power to do every thing he &s;hould require of him: This power man lo&s;t by his own fault. We were bound to &s;erve God, and to do what&s;oever he commanded us, as being his creatures; and al&s;o, 
<PB N="19" REF="043597_0019_101D5A785AE8F638">
we were under the &s;uperadded tie of a covenant, for that ef|fect. Now, we having, by our own fault, di&s;abled our&s;elves, &s;hall God lo&s;e his right of requiring our ta&s;k, becau&s;e we have thrown away the &s;trength he gave us, where-withal to perform it? Has the creditor no right to require payment of his money, becau&s;e the debtor has &s;quandered it away, and is not able to pay him? Truly, if God can require no more of us than w are able to do, we need no more to &s;ave us from <HI>wrath,</HI> but to make our&s;elves unable for every duty: And &s;o the deeper one is immer&s;ed in &s;in, he will be the more &s;ecure from <HI>wrath.</HI> Now, if God can require of men the duty they are not able to do, he can in ju&s;tice puni&s;h them for not doing it, notwith|&s;tanding their <HI>inability.</HI> If he has power to exact the debt of obedience, he has power al&s;o to ca&s;t the in&s;olvent debtor into pri&s;on, for not paying of it.</P>
<P>I find another objection &s;tated, and an&s;wered, by the &s;ame author, that I &s;uppo&s;e will naturally ari&s;e, in &s;ome people's minds, again&s;t what I have &s;aid, viz. Why then do you preach Chri&s;t to us; call us to come to him, to believe, repent, and u&s;e the means of &s;alvation? An&s;. Becau&s;e it is your duty &s;o to do. It is your duty to accept of Chri&s;t, as he is offered in the go&s;pel, to repent of your &s;ins, and to be holy in all man|ner of conver&s;ation: The&s;e things are commanded you of God, and his command, not your ability, is the mea&s;ure of your duty. Moreover, the calls, and exhortations, are the means, that God is plea&s;ed to make u&s;e of, for converting his elect, and working grace in their hearts:&mdash;Upon very good ground may we, at the command of God, who raileth the dead, go to their graves and cry in his name, <Q>Awake, thou that &s;leepe&s;t, and ari&s;e from the dead, and Chri&s;t &s;hall give thee light.</Q></P>
<P>But, methinks it would be well for &s;inners to con&s;ider, that their inability is a voluntary, wilful inability. It is not a na|tural inability, that hinders &s;inners from doing their duty to God, and their neighbour: But it is a moral inability, that hinders them from doing what God requires of them. Their wills are oppo&s;ed to the will of God: Their under&s;tandings are dark, and they chu&s;e to have them &s;o. Their affectio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> are turned away from God, and &s;et upon the creature more than upon the creator; and &s;inners are well plea&s;ed that it &s;hould be &s;o. God requires that we give him our hearts, in all that we do; but an unregenerate &s;inner, never did give his

heart to God, in any thing that ever he did; he never gave his heart to God, in one religious duty that ever he attempted to do: And the rea&s;on is, becau&s;e he does not love to give his heart to God; if he cho&s;e to give his heart to God, it would not be in the power of men, or devils, to hinder him from it; and therefore, the whole of the blame lies at the &s;inner's door. Therefore, &s;inners &s;hould know, that unle&s;s their hearts are changed by renewing grace, they never will, they never can perform one act of obedience acceptable to God. And there|fore, are far from doing <HI>much</HI> towards their own &s;alvation. They mu&s;t be born again&mdash;born from above, or they cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God.</P>
<P>Perhaps &s;ome unregenerate &s;inner will &s;ay, If I thought I &s;hould do nothing towards my &s;alvation, by all my prayers, reading the word of God, attending upon public wor&s;hip, maintaining the go&s;pel, and giving alms to the needy, &amp;c. I would leave off all tho&s;e duties, and try no more.&mdash;Truly thou ha&s;t brought out the affair ju&s;t as it is; and at once has di&s;covered the &s;pring, and motive of all thy good doings. Not a love to God, nor to his law; but a &s;eeking ju&s;tification by thy own doings. And this is the highe&s;t motive, of all the doings of the unregenerate. But let me tell thee, if ever thou art converted, thou wilt be brought to clo&s;er work than this; thou wilt be brought to as great extremity, as I&s;rael was in Egypt; that keep the law you mu&s;t; and keep the law you cannot, till you are driven out of all &s;elf-dependance, and brought to fall into the hand of God ju&s;t as you be, a poor, wretched, helple&s;s, mi&s;erable, blind and naked creature; and will have no plea before God, but &s;overeign mercy, and that only, through the merits of a crucified Redeemer.</P>
<P>Again, from what has been &s;aid, it may be &s;een, what was the grounds, and rea&s;ons of our &s;eparation from the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed churches&mdash;The three capital articles in our &s;eparation from the &s;tanding churches, were the&s;e, viz.

To which may be added, many things of le&s;&s;er note, as may be &s;een in the pre|ceding pages.</P>

Moreover, from the preceding remarks, and ob&s;ervations, it may be &s;een, that the people called Separates, are, as to their profe&s;&s;ion of faith, and practice, truly &s;criptural, apo&s;tolical, calvini&s;tical, and congregational.</P>
<P>Once more, from the foregoing remarks, it may be &s;een, that the &s;entiments advanced by Mr. F. and his brethren, are the &s;oul, life, nerves, and &s;inews of <HI>arminiani&s;m,</HI> and border very clo&s;ely upon the popi&s;h doctrine of merit. It &s;eems that their notion about the &s;alvation of &s;inners, is, that by the death of Chri&s;t, &s;inners are &s;et again upon their own legs, to work out their own &s;alvation; or at lea&s;t that they can do <HI>much</HI> towards it. That &s;inners can be better to-day, than they were ye&s;terday, and to-morrow, than they were to day, and &s;o by little and little, they can grow into true chri&s;tians&mdash;They do not tell &s;inners, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> they are totally depraved, and can never bear any fruit to God until they be born again. And that the new birth, is entirely effected by the agency of the &s;pirit of God, ordinarily working by the word of truth.</P>
<P>What remains &s;hall be by way of addre&s;s. And, Fir&s;t, To tho&s;e of my brethren of the &s;trict congregational profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Beloved brethren, It appears that the days we live in, are perilous days; perilous on various accounts; but in none more than in the over&s;preading of errors, and fal&s;e opinions, in matters of religion&mdash;The doctrine of ju&s;tification by works, &s;eems &s;trangely to in&s;inuate it&s;elf into mens minds&mdash;The doc|trine of gracele&s;s communion in the church, is again openly avowed by &s;ome&mdash;The doctrine of univer&s;al redemption, is making a &s;trange, and unaccountable progre&s;s, in our land, of late&mdash;To which may be added, an ove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> flowing of &s;in, and wickedne&s;s of every &s;ort; cur&s;ing, &s;wearing, lying, cheating, &s;tealing, oppre&s;&s;ion, bla&s;ph my. &s;abbath breaking, and con|tempt of the go&s;pel, &amp;c.

good confe&s;&s;ion, by your lives and conver&s;ation in the mid&s;t of a crooked and perver&s;e generation. E&s;pecially have your minds rooted and grounded in the truth, that &s;o you may not be ea&s;ily carried about with every wind of doctrine; &s;tudy the word of God; make it the man of your council; conform to its rules and precepts, in your whole conduct in the world; hold fa&s;t the things you have been taught, knowing of whom you have learned them; labour according to your ability, and op|portunity, to in&s;till into the minds of tho&s;e you are conver&s;ant with, the pure doctrines of the go&s;pel; &s;uch as the total de|pravity of man by the fall; the nece&s;&s;ity of regeneration, in order to &s;eeing the kingdom of God; ju&s;tification by faith without the deeds of the law; the ab&s;olute unfitne&s;s for church communion, without &s;aving grace; the eternity of hell tor|ments, unle&s;s we be wa&s;hed from our &s;ins, in the blood of Chri&s;t, &amp;c.

Let your light &s;o &s;hine before men, that others beholding good work, may glorify your father which is in heaven, and ye become the epi&s;tle of Chri&s;t, read and known of all men.</P>
<P>Secondly, To tho&s;e mini&s;ters, and churches, that hold to, and profe&s;s the principles advanced by Mr. F. in his charge to his &s;on, Suffer me to propo&s;e the following queries: Fir&s;t, Whether it can be proved from the word of God, that a per&s;on believing in his heart, that an unregenerate per&s;on can do &s;omething be&s;ides &s;in; that is, can bear good fruit; that they can do much towards their own &s;alvation; that if ever they are &s;aved, they mu&s;t work it out&mdash;can be a true believer in Je|&s;us Chri&s;t? Secondly, Whether a per&s;on profe&s;&s;ing the above &s;entiments, can be a vi&s;ible &s;aint? Thirdly, Whether it can be proved from the bible, that a mini&s;ter, believing in his heart, and profe&s;&s;ing with his mouth, the above &s;entiments, can be a true mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t? Or that a church, pro|fe&s;&s;ing the above opinions, and al&s;o that grace, as a term of communion in the vi&s;ible church, is a church-de&s;troying opi|nion, that took its ri&s;e from the man of &s;in&mdash;can be a vi&s;ible church of Chri&s;t?</P>
<P>Now, if the affirmative of the above queries, cannot be proved from the word of God, then I affirm the&s;e two things: Fir&s;t, That no rational being of the human race, is bound in 
<PB N="23" REF="043597_0023_101D5A8961DAAFE0">
duty, to hear &s;uch mini&s;ters preach; or to hold communion with &s;uch churches. Secondly, That it is the indi&s;pen&s;able duty of all people, to come out from, or be &s;eparate from &s;uch mini&s;ters, or churches, and touch not the unclean thing.</P>
<P>Thirdly, As there is &s;ome mini&s;ters, and churches, in this land, that are called &s;tanding mini&s;ters, and churches, that differ as widely from the opinions advanced by Mr. F. as any of the Separates do; &s;ome at lea&s;t, that I have &s;ome knowledge of; and I tru&s;t, are labouring to promote the &s;ame intere&s;t of the Redeemer, that I hope the people called Separates are en|gaged in. To all &s;uch, &s;uffer me to propo&s;e the following queries: Fir&s;t, Whether it is not the duty of chri&s;tians, that are agreed in the e&s;&s;entials of religion, to labour to walk toge|ther as far as po&s;&s;ibly they can; e&s;pecially in &s;uch a day as we live in, when the united &s;trength of all true chri&s;tians is called for, to oppo&s;e that flood of corruption, both in doctrine and practice, that is &s;o prevailing in our land at this day? Thirdly, Whether the difference between &s;uch churches, and tho&s;e of us that are called &s;trict congregationali&s;ts, is &s;o great, that it ought to bar us from a fellow&s;hip together, or a free communi|on one with another? Thirdly, Whether it is not the duty of &s;uch churches, to break off their connection with &s;uch churches as hold to, and practi&s;e upon, the principles, and opinions, advanced by Mr. F. at the afore&s;aid ordination?</P>
<P>La&s;tly, To people in general, into who&s;e hands the&s;e pa|pers may come, e&s;pecially in the State of Connecticut, I &s;hall only &s;ay, that matters of a religious nature, are things of the highe&s;t concern; and therefore ought not to be taken up upon tru&s;t. The doctrine of an implicit faith, held to in the church of Rome, has long &s;ince been exploded by the Prote&s;tant churches. We ought not, therefore, to condemn others, in the thing that we allow. It is the duty of all men to &s;earch the &s;criptures for them&s;elves; and form their opinions, and practice, in matters of religion, according to the be&s;t under|&s;tanding they can obtain, of the will of God, in his holy word. This is a duty, and a privilege, that all men have a right to enjoy, (provided they do not abu&s;e it to acts of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, or di&s;turbance of the commonwealth) and cannot be deprived of, without an infringement upon the liberties of conference; a liberty which no man ought to give up, or can give up, without parting with his birthright; and ought to be contend|ed for, even to the lo&s;s of all earthly things.&mdash;The principal 
<PB N="24" REF="043597_0024_101D5A8B16324BF8">
de&s;ign of my writing the&s;e papers, is to put people upon &s;earch|ing the &s;criptures for them&s;elves; e&s;pecially in tho&s;e things that I have oppo&s;ed Mr. F. in. And to let people know what the difference is, between tho&s;e called &s;tanding churches, and tho&s;e called (by an act of a&s;&s;embly pa&s;&s;ed in May &s;e&s;&s;ions, 1777) &s;trict congregationali&s;ts; who by &s;aid act are freed from taxes to &s;upport the e&s;tabli&s;hed mini&s;try, or meeting-hou&s;es in this State, under certain limitations, and re&s;trictions;<NOTE PLACE="foot">It could have been wi&s;hed, that &s;aid act had extended to all &s;uch churches as are de&s;cribed in it, in their infant &s;tate; and whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> they are deprived of ordained mini&s;ters among them, by death or otherwi&s;e, which I think is but rea&s;onable. And I hope our Gene|ral A&s;&s;embly will find it their duty, as well as their glory, &s;pon|taneou&s;ly to make that addition to &s;aid act.</NOTE> that &s;o people, that are like minded with us, may take the benefit of &s;aid act of a&s;&s;embly, and not be obliged to pay their money for that which is not bread, nor their labour for that which &s;atisfieth not.&mdash;It is likely, that many people, when they hear the words <HI>&s;trict congregationali&s;t</HI> u&s;ed, form &s;ome barbarous ideas about the principle, and the profe&s;&s;ors of it; but if I may u&s;e the term without offence, I would &s;ay, that it is true chri&s;tian whigi&s;m, and rai&s;es the noble mind of man above the low, &s;ervile, prie&s;t-ridden condition, that chri&s;tendom has been of|ten &s;unk into, as whigi&s;m in a civil &s;tate does the minds of men above tyranny&punc; and therefore, I have given a &s;hort ac|count of our principles, &s;o far as it relates to gathering church|es, and church government; and hope, all my readers will carefully examine the &s;ame by the word of God, and form their practice according to the be&s;t light they can obtain therefrom.</P>
<P>P. S. It may be thought by &s;ome, that in what I have &s;aid, re&s;pecting tho&s;e that plead for gracele&s;s communion, are ad|vocate, for the devil that I have reproached that good man, Mr. Stoddard. To which I would &s;ay, that we look upon it no unju&s;t reproach to &s;ay that Solomon of old was an idolater, or at lea&s;t introduced idolatry into I&s;rael; and as his great grand-&s;on Jo&s;iah, beat down his high places; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Mr. Stod|dard's grand-&s;on Jonathan, hath fairly beat down what his grand-father laboured to build up! So that none &s;ince, have been able, to exculpate Mr. Stoddard, from being an advocate for the devil, in his pleading for gracele&s;s communion in the church. Although he was, perhaps, as good a man, as King Solomon of old.</P>
