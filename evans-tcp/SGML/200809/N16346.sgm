<HEAD>A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF THE MARQUIS DE CHATELLUX'S TRAVELS IN <HI>NORTH-AMERICA.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I TAKE the earlie&s;t opportunity of letting you know, how much I have &s;uffered by the peru&s;al of your travels, and I think it nece&s;&s;ary to make this declaration public. I have a very cogent rea&s;on for &s;o doing. They, in many places, contain errors, and, I will venture to &s;ay, a poi&s;on, which, under your name, will have a rapid circulation; and to which we cannot be too ha&s;ty in applying an antidote.</P>
<P>A poi&s;on! You may &s;tart at the expre&s;&s;ion; but I can neither &s;uppre&s;s or &s;often it, as it is &s;o preci&s;ely characteri&s;tic of your opinions re&s;pecting the Quakers, the Negroes, and the People.</P>
<P>In vilifying the Quakers, you may prevent the good effects of their pious example. In refu&s;ing the name of men to the Negroes, you give your &s;anction to the treating them like bea&s;ts of burthen, if not to the &s;pilling of their blood; and you hinder the effects of that philo&s;ophical commotion, which will no doubt procure their general emancipation. In making the People contemptible, you invite their oppre&s;&s;ors to rivet their chains. The&s;e are matters of great
<PB N="2" REF="020981_0003_0FB1695EFA5E7970">
importance.&mdash;They will ju&s;tify me to the pub|lic, for having taken up my pen in &s;o precipitate a manner; they will ju&s;tify me, even in your eyes, for having u&s;ed it again&s;t your&s;elf: your rea&s;on will undoubtedly plead for me, in oppo&s;ition to your feel|ings, and you will pardon me for having publi&s;hed truths, perhaps di&s;agreeable ones for you, when I &s;hall have convinced you, that they are of public uti|lity, and not to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. <HI>Amicus Plato &s;ed magis ami<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">a veritas.</HI> This &s;hould be the motto of every writer who has really the public good at heart.</P>
<P>I do not mean, in this place, to critici&s;e your book throughout.&mdash;Let the journali&s;ts point out the <HI>beau|ties</HI> of your &s;tile.&mdash;My bu&s;ine&s;s is to obviate the mi&s;|chievous tendency of your work, without paying any attention to the elegance of the language. I &s;hould, indeed, have been better plea&s;ed, if you had not &s;hewn &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s about getting a bad &s;upper, or &s;o muc h plea&s;ure from having made a good one; and could have di&s;pen&s;ed with the exact detail you have given us of every di&s;h; for it is not the journal of an Apicius, but that of a philo&s;opher and &s;tate&s;|man which we expect to read, when we &s;ee the name of the author of <HI>La Felicit&eacute; Publique</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An excellent treati&s;e, (allowing for a few errors.) attributed to the MARQUIS de CHATELLUX, and which I have commended in &s;everal of my writings.</NOTE> in the title page.&mdash;I &s;hould have been better plea&s;ed if your ob&s;ervations had not been confined to taverns, and if you had not &s;acrificed our American friends to the plea&s;ure of making je&s;ts.&mdash;Alas! what will be the opinion of tho&s;e whom you have thus offended, when they read your book&mdash;and how can we expect a friendly reception from them, when they find their &s;ecrets betrayed, and the unre&s;erved effu&s;ions of the heart ridiculed by a man decorated with &s;o many ti|tles? What confidence will they now place in an ob|&s;cure Frenchman? On his fir&s;t approach, the Ame|can will exclaim&mdash;are you al&s;o come to &s;py out our follies, and publi&s;h them to Europe?</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="020981_0004_0FB1696170985690">It would have been &s;atisfactory to have &s;een more penetration in your enquiries concerning the effects of the different political con&s;titutions of America.&mdash; I could have wi&s;hed for &s;ome account of the number of criminals; of the crimes which are mo&s;t frequent; of the difference of morals in the cities, in the coun|try, and in the newly &s;ettled parts; of the &s;tate of the finances, &amp;c. and I &s;hould al&s;o have been better plea&s;ed, if, in&s;tead of railing at democracies, you had &s;ummed up grievances and well atte&s;ted facts.&mdash; But this is not a proper place for the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the&s;e intere&s;ting &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The principal charges, I bring again&s;t you, may be reduced to three:</P>
<P N="1">I. You have calumniated and ridiculed the re&s;pect|able &s;ect of Quakers.</P>
<P N="2">II. You have vilified the Negroes.</P>
<P N="3">III. You have vilified Mankind and the People.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the three general charges again&s;t you, which I now lay before the tribunal of the Public.&mdash; After having di&s;cu&s;&s;ed them, I &s;hall add &s;ome reflec|tions on &s;everal other &s;ubjects you have treated of, which appear to me equally &s;u&s;ceptible of cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>In making this examination, I &s;hall, fir&s;t of all, quote your opinions and a&s;&s;ertions, and then endea|vour to refute them.</P>
<P>I begin with the article concerning the Quakers.</P>

<HEAD><HI>VINDICATION</HI> of the <HI>QUAKERS.</HI></HEAD>
<P><Q>In&s;tead of their company, we had that of Mr. Benezet, an old Quaker, who&s;e &s;hort &s;tature, and low, <HI>mean</HI> figure, formed a <HI>perfect</HI> contra&s;t to Mr. Pendleton's. This Mr. Benezet may be looked on rather as a model of what the Quakers ought to be than as a &s;pecimen of what they are.&mdash;As his only object was the good of others, his charity and genero&s;ity made him greatly re&s;pected in tho&s;e more happy times, when a citizen derived all his honor from his virtues. Now the din of arms has drowned the &s;ighs of charity, and the love of our
<PB N="4" REF="020981_0005_0FB1696379EE8160">
fellow creatures yields to patrioti&s;m. Yet Mr. Bene|zet &s;till continues in the practice of doing good. He came to get &s;ome information from me, on the means lately found out in France, of re&s;toring drowned per|&s;ons to life. I promi&s;ed, not only to &s;end him an account of the methods u&s;ed in tho&s;e ca&s;es, when I returned to Newport, but al&s;o to procure him one of the boxes which our government has ordered to be placed at every &s;ea-port town. We &s;oon got bet|ter acquainted; and, &s;peaking of the misfortunes of war, he &s;aid to me,&mdash;My Friend, I know thou art a man of letters, and a member of the French academy. Several good things have lately been writen by men of letters; they have attacked errors and prejudices, and e&s;pecially intolerance: Will not they try to give men a di&s;ta&s;te for war, and make them live to|gether like friends and brethren? Thou art right, &s;aid I, in expecting &s;omething from the progre&s;s of philo&s;ophical knowledge. Several active hands are now at work upon the great edifice of public good; but it will be to no purpo&s;e for them to fini&s;h any part of it, while the foundation is wanting, and this foundation is, as thou ha&s;t &s;aid, a general peace. As to intolerance and per&s;ecution, it is true, that tho&s;e two enemies of mankind are not yet &s;uf|ficiently chained down; but let me whi&s;per a word in thy ear, the full meaning of which thou wilt not perhaps comprehend, though thou art well ac|quainted with the French language. They are no longer <HI>fa&s;hionable;</HI> and, I &s;hould even think, they were nearly <HI>out of date,</HI> were it not for &s;ome little matters thou art unacquainted with: which is, that tho&s;e who attack them are &s;ometimes impri&s;oned, while their defenders are rewarded with livings of an hundred thou&s;and livres a year. An hundred thou&s;and livres a year! cries Benezet, why, with that they might build ho&s;pitals, and &s;et up manu|factories; and, to be &s;ure, that's what they do with their money. No, my friend, &s;aid I, per&s;ecution mu&s;t be paid for; and yet, I mu&s;t &s;ay, the pay is
<PB N="5" REF="020981_0006_0FB169650320CFD0">
but mean, and the highe&s;t price given by the riche&s;t per&s;ecutor, is no more than one thou&s;and, or twelve hundred livres a year, to &s;ome &s;atirical poets, or writers of journals, who are enemies to lite|rature, and who&s;e works are much read, tho' they have but a dull &s;ale. Friend, &s;ays the Quaker to me, this per&s;ecution is a &s;trange thing; I can hard|ly believe what has happened to my&s;elf. My fa|ther was a Frenchman born, and &s;o am I. It is now about &s;ixty years &s;ince he was obliged to &s;eek an a&s;ylum in England, carrying with him his chil|dren, the only trea&s;ures which he could &s;ave in his misfortunes. Ju&s;tice, or what is called &s;o in thy country, had him hung in effigy, becau&s;e he ex|plained the Go&s;pel in a different way from your prie&s;ts. The Engli&s;h clergy gave my father but lit|tle more &s;atisfaction, &s;o that he wi&s;hed to get away from all hierarchy, and came to &s;ettle in this coun|try, where I have lived very happily until the breaking out of the war. I have long &s;ince forgot|ten all the per&s;ecutions my family have undergone. I love thy nation, becau&s;e it is a mild and a feeling one; and for thee, my friend, I know thou do&s;t every thing in thy power to &s;erve thy fellow creatures. When thou returne&s;t to Europe, get thy brethren to a&s;&s;i&s;t thee:&mdash;and let me now recom|mend our friends in Rhode-I&s;land to thy attention. He then named all the Quakers who live in that &s;tate, and are pretty numerous; and recommended them to my care. At parting, he a&s;ked leave to &s;end me &s;ome pamphlets of his <HI>own manufacturing,</HI> written chiefly in defence of his &s;ect. I a&s;&s;ured him, <HI>it would give me great plea&s;ure to read them;</HI> and he did not fail to &s;end them next morning.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Of whatever &s;ect a man, glowing with zeal and love for his fellow creatures, may be, he is mo&s;t undoubtedly a re&s;pectable being; but, I confe&s;s, I cannot be&s;tow on this &s;ect in general, the e&s;teem which &s;ome individuals of it are entitled to. The law, which many of them follow, of not &s;aying
<PB N="6" REF="020981_0007_0FB169667B522070">
<HI>you,</HI> nor <HI>&s;ir, is far from giving them an air of plainne&s;s or candor.</HI> It is perhaps to make up for this clown|i&s;hne&s;s, that they often &s;peak in a <HI>whining, in&s;inuat|ing</HI> tone, which is perfectly <HI>je&s;uitical.</HI> Their con|duct too, is quite of a piece with their language. Concealing <HI>their indifference for the public good,</HI> un|der the appearance of religion, they are &s;paring of blood, it is true, and <HI>e&s;pecially of their own;</HI> they are mere &s;harpers at <HI>cheating</HI> both parties out of their money, and that <HI>without a blu&s;h,</HI> or the lea&s;t regard to what may be thought of them. It is a received maxim in trade, that they are not to be tru&s;ted. This opinion is a ju&s;t one, and time will more and more &s;hew the propriety of it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Indeed, nothing can be more dangerous than en|thu&s;ia&s;m in its decline; for hypocri&s;y is the only &s;ub&s;titute that can be found for it. This mon&s;ter, &s;o well known in Europe, gains but too much ground in every religious &s;ect.</Q></P>
<P><Q>On Sunday, the 10th, I determined to <HI>take a turn thro' the churches, and &s;tudy the different modes of wor|&s;hip.</HI> Unfortunately for me, the &s;everal &s;ects, who agree in nothing el&s;e, have fixed on the &s;ame hour for a&s;&s;embling their congregations; &s;o that I could only go to the Quaker's meeting-hou&s;e in the morning, and to the church of England in the afternoon. The Qua|ker's meeting is a &s;quare room, in every part of which, and parallel to the four walls, are benches and de&s;ks, &s;o that they &s;it oppo&s;ite to one another; without altar or pulpit to fix their attention. When they are met, &s;ome one of their elders makes an <HI>ex|tempore</HI> prayer, ju&s;t what comes into his head; they are then &s;ilent, 'till &s;ome man or woman is in&s;pired, and gets up to &s;peak. Travellers mu&s;t be believed on their words, let the account they give be ever &s;o extraordinary. Like Ario&s;to, I &s;hall relate pro|digies &mdash;<HI>dir&ograve; maraviglia.</HI> It is neverthele&s;s true, that a woman <HI>held her tongue</HI> ju&s;t as I came in. A man took her place, and &s;poke <HI>like a blockhead on in|ternal grace, the illumination of the Spirit, and all the
<PB N="7" REF="020981_0008_0FB169680EA44698">
other tenets of his &s;ect,</HI> which <HI>he had over and over again,</HI> without attempting to explain any thing. He at length got to the end of his &s;ermon, to the great joy of his brethren and &s;i&s;ters, who all appeared ab&s;ent and tired out. After &s;even or eight minutes &s;ilence, an old man got on his knees, and retailed us out of a very <HI>in&s;ipid</HI> prayer, after which they broke up the meeting.</Q></P>
<P><Q>On leaving this <HI>gloomy</HI> and <HI>clowni&s;h</HI> meeting, the &s;ervice of the church of England, with the mu&s;ic and ornaments, &s;eemed like an <HI>opera.</HI> An <HI>hand&s;ome</HI> pulpit, placed before a <HI>fine</HI> organ, a <HI>well-dre&s;&s;ed</HI> mini&s;ter in the pulpit, reading, &s;peaking, and &s;ing|ing, <HI>with a grace perfectly theatrical;</HI> the young women, <HI>from the pit and boxes,</HI> joining him with their melodious voices; a &s;oft and agreeable &s;inging, interrupted by &s;ome excellent airs on the organ; all this, compared to the wor&s;hip of the Quakers, Ana|bapti&s;ts, and Pre&s;byterians, &s;eemed rather a little Para|di&s;e, than the road to Paradi&s;e. However, by reflecting on &s;o many different &s;ects, &s;ome of whom are rigid, and &s;ome trifling, but every one imperious and narrow, one is lead to believe, that all mankind read the great book of nature, as <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Montauciel is the name of an ignorant &s;oldier, one of the characters in the De&s;erter, a comic opera. He engages the De&s;erter to teach him to read. He gets a bit of paper in his hand, on which the words, <HI>vous etes un blanc bee,</HI> are written, and on &s;pelling the letters, he makes out <HI>trompette ble&s;&s;&eacute;e.</HI> The De&s;erter &s;hews him his mi&s;take, and the word <HI>blanc bee</HI> (&s;impleton) becomes the &s;ource of altercation.</NOTE> <HI>Montauciel read his own;</HI> where, for <HI>"vous etes un blanc bee"</HI>&mdash;he always read, <HI>"trompette ble&s;&s;&eacute;e."</HI> It is a thou&s;and to one that he gue&s;&s;es the meaning of a &s;ingle line, as he cannot even &s;pell; but &s;hould &s;uch an one come to you for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, give him none. You had better leave him to enjoy his mi&s;take, than cut one another's throats.</Q></P>
<P>This is the mo&s;t violent attack in your travels a|gain&s;t the Quakers. In other parts you have &s;everal things again&s;t them, but none worth mentioning.</P>
<P>Before entering into the particulars which the ex|amination
<PB N="8" REF="020981_0009_0FB1696C0198B4E8">
of your &s;atire requires, I &s;hall make bold to a&s;k you, Sir, what facts, books, or men, have authori&s;ed you to condemn this &s;ect &s;o ha&s;tily? Have you known a great number, or the generality of Quakers? Have you lived a long time in habits of in|timacy with them? Can you form a judgment of them all, and know the worth of the whole &s;ociety, from having been at one or two of their meetings? or from having conver&s;ed with one or two of them in a ha&s;ty manner? or from having been introduced to one who did not think fit to look at you? When you went into that religious meeting, where you formed a judgment of the di&s;cour&s;e, or prayer which you heard, were you in a proper &s;tate of mind for the &s;incere inve&s;tigation of truth? Had you no prejudices again&s;t the Quakers? and your theatrical knowledge too, which brought ridicule into your head, this ridi|cule which is &s;o powerful an argument for a French Man; did not this &s;ame knowledge &s;pread a veil over your mind&mdash;Have you not been prejudiced again&s;t the Quakers by Voltaire, who has by turns, prai&s;ed them and endeavoured to make them appear ridiculous, though he knew but little of them? And indeed, who would not at fir&s;t &s;ight, regard your te&s;timony as &s;u&s;picious, and your judgment as partial, on con|&s;idering your moral and religious opinions, your cha|racter of academician, &s;oldier and man of quality, that three fold character, which this &s;ociety &s;o ju&s;tly dete&s;t.</P>
<P>And why have you, in forming a judgment of them, abandoned tho&s;e principles by which our judg|ment &s;hould ever be directed&mdash;We have no right to cen&s;ure any one, unle&s;s we have either our&s;elves de|tected him violating the laws of honour and probity, or upon the authentic and impartial te&s;timony of others on his crime. Vague reports ought never to have any weight.</P>
<P>To condemn a whole body of men at once, a &s;oci|ety of long &s;tanding, to accu&s;e them of cheating, of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and hypocri&s;y, requires a &s;eries of well
<PB N="9" REF="020981_0010_0FB1696DCBFC4490">
atte&s;ted facts, the truth of which is of the greater con&s;equence, as the charges are &s;erious, and involve &s;o many people in them.</P>
<P>Thus, &s;hould any one charge the Catholics with hav|ing been per&s;ecutors, they might prove it by their Autos|da-f&eacute;, their inqui&s;ition, Saint Bartholomew's day, the Iri&s;h ma&s;&s;acre, &amp;c. To prove that the Puritans of former times were per&s;ecutors, we need only men|tion the tragical &s;cenes which were acted during the revolution of 1650 in England, and the per&s;ecutions they excited in the new world.&mdash;To prove the ambi|tious, intriguing and per&s;ecuting &s;pirit of the Je&s;uits, we have only to refer to their uncea&s;ing manoeuvres in England and France, the de&s;truction of Port-Roy|al, and the many lettres de cachet, which they have made u&s;e of to de&s;troy, in &s;ecret pri&s;ons, a crowd of victims, who&s;e only fault was a different way of thinking&mdash;The&s;e are facts well atte&s;ted.</P>
<P>But have you, Sir, any &s;uch facts to allege again&s;t the Quakers? not a &s;ingle one&mdash;So far from that, you produce none but what are in their favour&mdash;For I &s;hall now and then have the &s;atisfaction of making u&s;e of your own words to refute you.</P>
<P>But it is becau&s;e you bring no po&s;itive charge of any crime again&s;t the Quakers; it is becau&s;e you judge them only by hear-&s;ay and vague reports, that I conclude you have no proof of the vices and crimes you reproach them with; and that your judgment of them is unju&s;t.</P>
<P>I will not, however, confine my&s;elf to this general method of rea&s;oning, but will follow you &s;tep by &s;tep&mdash; I believe your reflections on the Quakers may be re|duced to three principle heads; they affect</P>
<P>Either their moral and private conduct,</P>
<P>Their religious tenets,</P>
<P>Or their civil principles&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to &s;hew how unju&s;tly you have treated them in the&s;e three different re&s;pects.</P>

an <HI>air</HI> of &s;implicity and candor. This is not the cu|&s;tom of <HI>many,</HI> but of <HI>all</HI> the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>You &s;peak of an <HI>air,</HI> as if the Quakers a&s;&s;umed any <HI>airs;</HI> as if their plainne&s;s was but affectation. They are much above it; the plainne&s;s of their lan|guage con&s;i&s;ts in renouncing tho&s;e empty forms, tho&s;e ridiculous compliments and fa&s;hionable fal&s;hoods which French politene&s;s requires; it is on this plainne&s;s the Quakers value them&s;elves; they do not tell a &s;tranger that they are charmed to &s;ee him; they keep &s;ilence at the fir&s;t interview, and wait for an opportunity of forming a judgment; they do not &s;queeze the hand of a man whom they de&s;pi&s;e; they do not bow to a fine &s;uit of clothes, a cro&s;s, or a red or blue ribband; they do not pay court to a mini&s;ter, who is dete&s;ted by the nation&mdash;If they <HI>thee</HI> and <HI>thou</HI> every body, it is be|cau&s;e they believe all men are equal; are not the&s;e &s;ufficient rea&s;ons for a Philo&s;opher?</P>
<P>The undaunted manner in which they have &s;up|ported this cu&s;tom at court, and at the bar; that boldne&s;s which has con&s;trained tho&s;e in authority to give way to them, will not even this entitle them to your prai&s;e? For admitting with you, that it is a matter of indifference to &s;ay <HI>you</HI> or <HI>thou</HI> to a &s;ingle per&s;on, yet it mu&s;t be of importance, to have a cha|racter, and to po&s;&s;e&s;s a degree of firmne&s;s, of that un&s;haken firmne&s;s, which is &s;o hateful to oppre&s;&s;ors, becau&s;e they dread the con&s;equences of it; and, it matters not, that this firmne&s;s appears in &s;mall things, and trifling circum&s;tances; for there is no doubt, but it will be called forth with greater energy, on more important occa&s;ions. Now, the per&s;ecutions which the Quakers have undergone, for not giving up their <HI>Thee</HI> and <HI>Thou,</HI> &s;hew a greatne&s;s of character, and of con&s;equence a &s;uperiority over the re&s;t of mankind, which they have ever &s;u&s;tained, when their civil or religious principles have been attacked by govern|ment. But after all, as to this cu&s;tom of theirs, which you find &s;o much fault with, let us &s;ee whether they or the men of the world are in the right: &s;ince <HI>You</HI> takes in &s;everal per&s;ons, why make u&s;e of it to one

only? adulation fir&s;t invented this corrupt practice, and pride and ba&s;ene&s;s of &s;oul have brought it into general u&s;e: The Quakers wi&s;h to re&s;tore the cu&s;toms of propriety, and what objections can you make to them? mu&s;t they limp becau&s;e you are not &s;trong enough to walk upright?</P>
<P>If our &s;elf-conceited literati, and would-be philo&s;o|phers, had really any philo&s;ophy about them, would not they imitate the Quakers? Would they not re|nounce tho&s;e mean ceremonies, which &s;how the &s;lavi&s;h|ne&s;s and fal&s;hood of mankind? Would they not in|&s;tead of ridicuiling the Quakers, endeavour, like them to exalt human nature, and compel the great to be|lieve that the lowe&s;t of their fellow creatures is their equal: This was the conduct of Diogenes, the hero of our Academicians, who&s;e example however they will not follow; Diogenes in this re&s;pect acted like a true Quaker, that is to &s;ay, like a wi&s;e man, who knew the dignity of man, and the in&s;ignificancy of tho&s;e di&s;tinctions which we meet with in civil life.</P>
<P>And I would be glad to know too, what meaning you affix to the word <HI>candor,</HI> which you &s;ay the Quakers make u&s;e of as a blind? To have <HI>candor,</HI> is to &s;peak unre&s;ervedly from the very heart, which mu&s;t be pure for &s;uch a purpo&s;e&mdash;To have <HI>candor</HI> is to &s;peak what you think, and to pay the &s;tricte&s;t attention to truth. This is the general character of the Quakers, and it is a character they have obtained by the &s;acrifice of their lives.</P>
<P>But you think very differently; for you charge them with a <HI>whining, in&s;inuating tone, which is perfectly je&s;u|itical;</HI> you &s;ay too, <HI>that their conduct is quite of a piece.</HI> Horrid and fal&s;e compari&s;on! what do we mean by a Je&s;uit? a deceiver, with the air of candor, an art|ful hypocrite, one who is ambitious and plotting, un|der the appearance of renouncing honors and riches; a tyrant with an air of &s;oftne&s;s, &s;ubjection and polite|ne&s;s, and one who pretends to be humane, and yet is wholly given to &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Je&s;uits were inflamed with a de&s;ire of domi|neering over the the con&s;ciences of men, that they might
<PB N="17" REF="020981_0018_0FB1697AC75818B0">
rule kingdoms, open pri&s;ons by their nod, and bury alive their rivals and their enemies&mdash;this was <HI>their</HI> rea&s;on for affecting a <HI>whining in&s;inuating tone,</HI> which hurts no one's vanity, but flatters and mi&s;leads it.</P>
<P>The Je&s;uits raged with the de&s;ire of making pro|&s;elytes, they be&s;ieged the growing talents of the youth, and bent them to their own purpo&s;es; they over-reached great and &s;mall; they had &s;pies at court, and at the bar; they had their puffers and parti&s;ans in pay. In &s;hort they were for attempting and &s;ub|duing every thing.</P>
<P>I would a&s;k any one, who knows any thing of the Quakers, who has lived ever &s;o &s;hort a time among&s;t them, whether any part of this character &s;uits this plain people? can they, who renounce all places and honors, be charged with the lu&s;t of power? can they, who have no ambition, be called plotters? &s;hould they be &s;uppo&s;ed deceitful, without any motives for being &s;o? does not the whole world know, that they do not attempt to make pro&s;elytes! that they do not &s;eek for prai&s;e, either by writing or flattery! every body knows that they dete&s;t intolerance, and, of con|&s;equence, tho&s;e horrid methods which are practi&s;ed on per&s;ons in confinement, tho&s;e private tortures and inqui&s;itions which the Je&s;uits made u&s;e of to over|throw the doctrine of the <HI>efficacy of grace.</HI> The Quakers have been often derided, mutilated, and im|pri&s;oned; they have never treated their enemies in &s;uch a manner; can the &s;ame be &s;aid of the Je&s;uits?</P>
<P>Is there any thing extraordinary in this &s;oftne&s;s of their manners? does it not naturally accompany their love of humanity, and principles of univer&s;al tolera|tion? there is nothing in it characteri&s;tic of the in&s;inuating &s;harper; his &s;chemes are for the acqui|&s;ition of power, riches, fame or titles; but the true Quaker &s;eeks not for power, he is of all men the lea&s;t de&s;irous of wealth, he cares little for a name, and de&s;pi&s;es all marks of di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>But you are not &s;atisfied with denying them all preten&s;ions to plainne&s;s and candor; you are not
<PB N="18" REF="020981_0019_0FB1697C8EAAA380">
&s;atisfied with comparing them to one of the mo&s;t ambitious, plotting, and tyrannical &s;ects that ever ex|i&s;ted &mdash;but you will not even allow them to po&s;&s;e&s;s common hone&s;ty. You tell us, that during the Ame|rican war, they cheated both parties out of their mo|ney, without a blu&s;h, and carele&s;s of what might be thought of their conduct.</P>
<P>And yet you bring no proof in &s;upport of &s;o &s;e|vere an accu&s;ation: an accu&s;ation which affects the whole &s;ociety; which affects their Benezets and Mifflins: men whom you prai&s;e, and whom the lov|ers of virtue will admire. How could you, thus in a moment, endeavour to di&s;grace &s;o many re&s;pectable characters? And even admitting, what I neither can nor will believe, till you prove it by well-atte&s;ted facts&mdash;admitting, I &s;ay, that there were &s;ome Quak|ers who took advantage of the times, to &s;ell at exor|bitant prices, or, as you expre&s;s it, to cheat both par|ties out of their money, was it well done in you, to throw the odium on the whole &s;ociety? If any among&s;t them are culpable, name them; it is your duty to do &s;o. You, your&s;elf are culpable if you do not; for, indeed, by your &s;ilence, you involve both the innocent and guilty in the charge.</P>
<P>But as you never could have known the Quaker's methods of dealing; as you never could, nor ever will be able to prove, that they are all cheats, with|out exception, it follows that your a&s;&s;ertions are downright defamation; for which you ought to make amends at the public tribunal, where you have unfair|ly traduced them. At this tribunal, I now impeach you. I, who have been well acquainted with &s;ome Quakers, and am fully convinced of the general probity of their &s;ociety, and ob&s;erving, that they are accu&s;ed by a man of rank and quality, and member of &s;everal academies&mdash;con&s;iderations which might lead the pub|lic to doubt of the hone&s;ty of the Quakers, I &s;ummons you to produce your charges, and your proofs before the public; and if you are &s;till &s;ilent, let me once more repeat it, I &s;hall think my&s;elf authorized to treat your a&s;&s;ertions as mere defamation.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="020981_0020_0FB1697DC7681A58">This word will &s;hock you, &s;ir; I u&s;e it with re|gret; but I do not u&s;e it without having &s;ufficient|ly attended to the meaning of it.

Now, do not you accu&s;e the Quakers of being &s;harpers, cheats, hypocrites, and men carele&s;s of the public good?</P>
<P>We will &s;uppo&s;e the Quakers may have furni&s;hed the Engli&s;h, as well as the Americans, with provi&s;ions. Do you call that a crime? You &s;hould recollect that the Quakers look on all men as their brethren, and that no one is their enemy, not even their per&s;ecutors. In this point of view, Engli&s;h and Americans were the &s;ame to them. The greate&s;t part of them thought that England was carrying on an unju&s;t war. But the Quakers did not look on the He&s;&s;ians as part|ners in this act of inju&s;tice, they thought them equally entitled to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance with their American brethren.</P>
<P>According to my pre&s;ent &s;entiments that the on|ly ju&s;tifiable war, is that which is carried on to re|&s;i&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion, and that the American war was of this kind, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I &s;hould have been better plea&s;|ed if the Quakers had joined the Americans, that they might the &s;ooner have got rid of the de&s;troyers of their country.</P>
<P>But &s;ince they have not done &s;o, &s;ince they have &s;crupulou&s;ly adhered to their principles, of not &s;hed|ding blood, I cannot accu&s;e them of any thing crimi|nal; and the le&s;s &s;o, becau&s;e their principles and con|duct were known before hand, to both parties <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Author of his work, propo&s;es, in a future publication on the the Quakers, to examine into the truth of this charge.

glad of well &s;tated facts. But, as there are none, for you have not furni&s;hed me with any, I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, that you have been led away, by the common prejudice, again&s;t the merchant who takes the benefit of circum|&s;tances, to &s;ell at an advanced price.</P>
<P>When any trade is free, not in the hands of indi|viduals, when the buyer is not forced to give what|ever price may be demanded, there can be no cheat|ing, not even if they &s;old at the mo&s;t extravagant rates.</P>
<P>The natural con&s;equence of a war, is to rai&s;e the price of goods very high, becau&s;e produce is le&s;&s;ened, and goods become &s;carce. The &s;eller is then no more culpable for rai&s;ing the price on account of the &s;carcity, than the buyer would be for offering a &s;mall price in plentiful times. But the common people, who are u&s;ed to fixed prices, and who&s;e re&s;ources are dimini&s;hed in time of war; this common people, who are then forced to buy every thing at a high price, exclaim that they are cheated. And I dare &s;ay, that a great many of our French officers, in their travels through the United States, have, as well as you, met with poor inns, and bad fare; and yet were obliged to pay a high price, for a mean lodging, and a wretch|ed &s;upper. The&s;e, I have no doubt, often thought them&s;elves impo&s;ed upon, and looked upon all the American inn-keepers as cheats. And you, your|&s;elf, &s;eem to in&s;inuate as much in &s;everal places<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In one place among&s;t many others, when &s;peaking of one BESSONET, (whom you mi&s;take for a brother of BENEZET's.) you &s;ay, that he retain|ed none of his Quaker principles, but that of &s;elling at an extravagant price.</NOTE>. But you and your brother officers were all wrong; For you paid, fir&s;t, for the &s;carcity of hands, and ex|ce&s;&s;ive price of labour; &s;econdly, for the &s;carcity of provi&s;ions; thirdly, for the &s;carcity of travellers; and fourthly, for the &s;carcity of taverns; and, on the&s;e four different accounts, it is no wonder, if you paid four times as much as in France.</P>

I &s;hall only &s;ay, that this can never be called cheating, as long as the buy|er knows the quality of the goods, and the conditions of &s;ale: &s;econdly where there are many &s;ellers, the buyer is at liberty to purcha&s;e, or leave it alone.</P>
<P>The Quakers have the name of &s;elling at high rates, I &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e their merchandi&s;e is al|ways of a good quality.

<P>It is, be&s;ides, very well known, that the Quakers in general &s;ell nearly at a fixed price.

The&s;e are the men who are to be mi&s;tru&s;ted, and not the Quakers, who &s;ell at a fixed rate.</P>
<P>There is then very little probability in your &s;lan|derous a&s;&s;ertion, <HI>that it is a received maxim in trade, that they are not to be tru&s;ted.</HI></P>
<P>But I maintain that it is a fal&s;e a&s;&s;ertion. I have heard quite a different account of them at London&mdash; a city, wherein, if they were much inclined to cheat|ing and corruption, they would much &s;ooner become cheats, and be corrupted, than at Philadelphia. Now, this is far from being the ca&s;e, and it may be looked on as one of the greate&s;t prodigies of the age, that they have pre&s;erved their virtue in &s;uch a &s;ink of vice.</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay, you may have heard &s;uch an account in America. But would it not have been right for you to have traced out the foundation of this tale? Should you not have &s;ought for its origin in the

<HEAD><HI>RELIGIOUS TENETS</HI> of the <HI>QUAKERS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I &s;hall now go on to treat of the ridicule you throw on the Quakers, when &s;peaking of their mode of wor|&s;hip and religious tenets; and here too, I &s;hall follow you, &s;tep by &s;tep.</P>
<P><HI>On Sunday the</HI> 10th, &s;ay you, <HI>I determined to take a turn thro' the churches, and &s;tudy the different modes of wor&s;hip.</HI></P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that your's was a laughable way of <HI>&s;tudying;</HI> to go and hear a &s;ingle prayer or &s;ermon, and catch at hazard few expre&s;&s;ions, in a language and religion you were a &s;tranger to. Since all &s;ects have their peculiar idioms, and make u&s;e of com|mon words in a different way from other people&punc; the wit, who is for making &s;o &s;uperficial a cour&s;e of &s;tu|dies, runs a ri&s;k of under&s;tanding nothing, and of forming erroneous &s;entiments of every thing he hears.</P>
<P>But, what could you mean by taking this <HI>&s;trange turn through the churches?</HI> Was it to become ac|quainted with their ceremonies? The Pre&s;byterians have but few&mdash;and the Quakers none at all. Was it to become acquainted with the principles and &s;pirit of each &s;ect? This would have been a more rea&s;onable
<PB N="23" REF="020981_0024_0FB169868ABA8948">
and important object: But let a man be ever &s;o pe|netrating, how can he flatter him&s;elf with fully un|der&s;tanding, in a &s;ingle hour, at a &s;ingle opportunity, the principles and practice of any &s;ect? The fir&s;t is to be learnt from books, the &s;econd by frequent and long continued intercour&s;e.</P>
<P>We are but too much addicted to this mania of judg|ing of objects from &s;uperficial views, without going to the bottom of any thing. This is the ca&s;e with re|&s;pect to all the &s;ciences. A man will &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf very knowing in natural philo&s;ophy, and quite a ma&s;|ter of chymi&s;try, when he has attended a few lectures. This error has been already much complained of; but it does and will keep its ground, becau&s;e it is favora|ble to the quackery of teachers, and the lazine&s;s and vanity of &s;cholars.</P>
<P>"Unfortunately, &s;ay you, the &s;everal &s;ects, <HI>who agree in nothing el&s;e,</HI> have fixed on <HI>the &s;ame hour</HI> to a&s;|&s;emble their congregations."</P>
<P>How can you affirm, that the religious &s;ects in Eng|land, and in the United States, do not agree in any one point; when, all, to bring but a &s;ingle in&s;tance, look upon the Go&s;pel as a divine book; when, all, ex|cept the Unitarians, regard Chri&s;t as the Son of God, and all admit the nece&s;&s;ity of prayer, &amp;c. You know too much to be ignorant of the&s;e facts; but you have &s;acrificed the truth, to the pitiful plea&s;ure of making an antithe&s;is. It is rather &s;ingular too, that for the ac|commodation of the curious, you would wi&s;h to &s;ub|ject all the &s;ects to different hours, for the perform|ance of their wor&s;hip. Alas, why did not you make your <HI>tour</HI> of wor&s;hips, as the petits maitres of Paris do their <HI>tour</HI> of play-hou&s;es? A &s;ong at the Italian&mdash; a &s;cene at the French theatre&mdash;a dance at the Ope|ra &mdash;and a turn at Vauxhall&mdash;they have &s;een every thing, and know every thing, for they have &s;hewn them&s;elves every where, and all in the &s;pace of two hours.</P>
<P>When you made u&s;e of this expre&s;&s;ion, if you had but recollected, that the man, who&s;e &s;oul is rai&s;ed to God from a feeling &s;en&s;e of duty, has his attention
<PB N="24" REF="020981_0025_0FB169877B55BA50">
but little turned to &s;trangers, but is wholly fixed on one object; if you had remembered too, the perni|cious con&s;equences, which, I &s;hall hereafter &s;how, at|tend this way of degrading religious &s;ubjects, treating them in a light manner, and putting them on a level with play-hou&s;es, you would not have formed a judg|ment &s;o &s;uperficially of the Quakers, and Pre&s;byteri|ans, nor even of the members of the church of Eng|land.</P>
<P>If you had recollected too, that there is no di&s;tinc|tion of &s;ex in the &s;ight of God, you would certainly have &s;pared that &s;orry je&s;t upon the women, which no one expected to &s;ee from the pen of an admirer of the fair &s;ex, and an academician: <HI>"Like Ario&s;to, I &s;hall relate prodigies,</HI> dir&ograve; maraviglia, <HI>ju&s;t as I entered, a woman held her tongue."</HI></P>
<P>How could this trifling and hacknied piece of wit e&s;cape you, e&s;pecially with all the air of importance with which you make the quotation? You who are &s;o warm in the prai&s;e of our French ladies&mdash;have you, then, never been acquainted with any who knew how to be &s;till, or who&s;e conver&s;ation was agreeable? Have you never lived with Engli&s;h and American ladies? Have you not ob&s;erved that they are mode&s;t and &s;i|lent, never in ha&s;te to &s;peak, although well-inform|ed? Yes, well-informed, and well qualified to teach even men of learning and academicians. I &s;hall men|tion but one&mdash;Mrs. Macaulay: Her hi&s;tory of the Stuarts is certainly more u&s;eful than all the French academy has ever produced.</P>
<P>And be&s;ides, why would you le&s;&s;en the women? By undervaluing any one, you make him become de&s;|picable. The Quakers have done that ju&s;tice to their women which we refu&s;ed them. They have &s;hewn they were not unworthy of it; for <HI>Quakeri&s;m</HI> has had its <HI>Porcias.</HI></P>
<P>You &s;eem determined to find fault with every thing the Quakers do, whether they &s;peak or are &s;ilent. For you go on to &s;ay, "A man took the woman's place, and &s;poke <HI>like a block-head on internal grace, the illumination of the &s;pirit,</HI> and all the other tenets

of his &s;ect, which <HI>he had over and over again,</HI> but without explaining any thing.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here, &s;ir, make bold to a&s;k you if you were &s;ufficiently acquainted with the language of the &s;ect, to under&s;tand this Quaker, and to form a judgment of his di&s;cour&s;e? A foreigner may under&s;tand the eloquent Burke in the hou&s;e of commons, or Mi&s;s Young at the theatre, without being always able to comprehend the preacher of any &s;ociety. The Quakers, of all others, have a language of their own, which cannot be ea&s;ily under&s;tood, with|out having read &s;ome of their books, &s;uch as Barc|lay's Apology, with a great deal of attention. Now, I &s;hould &s;u&s;pect, from a word you have made u&s;e of, that you were not perfectly acquainted with the idiom and doctrine of the Quakers. It is when you find fault with the preacher for not <HI>explaining their religious tenets.</HI> Mo&s;t probably he was clear enough for his brethren who under&s;tood his language, while to you who did not comprehend it, he was ob&s;crue. Now on the &s;ame principles, what would you think of a man, who, having learned the Indo&s;tan language, only in the grammar of Halhed, &s;hould tell us of a Bramin's &s;peaking very &s;tupidly about Vi&s;tnou? What would you think of a wit, who, from his ignorance of the new doctrine of magneti&s;m, &s;hould call your <HI>reflec|tions on motion</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A pamphlet of the Marquis de Chatellux's, publi&s;hed at the end of Mon&s;. Berga&s;&s;e's reflections on magneti&s;m. This pamphlet has been generally complained of as ob&s;cure and unintelligible.</NOTE>, a collection of riddles? And what would you &s;ay, if an Engli&s;hman, ignorant of the many hundred revolutions which have happened in the Nomenclator of French chymi&s;try, &s;hould call the <HI>Oxigine</HI> of Me&s;&s;rs. Fourcroy and Lavoi&s;ier, a &s;tupid and ob&s;cure term?</P>
<P>It is no difficult matter to accu&s;e a &s;ect, or ridicule their tenets. I have &s;een &s;ome of tho&s;e je&s;ters, who could not even tell you the meaning of the technical terms which they had picked up&mdash;I have heard many of them quote the doctrines of Jan&s;enius with a &s;neer,
<PB N="26" REF="020981_0027_0FB1698AA3E94490">
who would have been greatly puzzled if any one had a&s;ked them to explain the very fir&s;t article.</P>
<P>The ignorant are led away by words, and I make no doubt, that mo&s;t per&s;ons who read your book, and know nothing of the Quakers, will form their judgment of them, from the caricatura you have drawn; from the&s;e &s;ingle words <HI>"inward grace, illumination which pro|ceeds from the &s;pirit,"</HI> and more e&s;pecially from the beautiful turn about <HI>&s;aying over and over again.</HI> They will exclaim&mdash;Where are the&s;e creatures from?&mdash; They are &s;urely born in the la&s;t age&mdash;or inhabitants of &s;ome other world&mdash;poor ignorant mortals!</P>
<P>I know nothing of the di&s;cour&s;e made by the Qua|ker you heard preach, but I will confe&s;s that the te|nets he &s;hould have &s;upported, the tenets of his &s;ect, do not appear to me to be &s;o <HI>&s;tupid</HI> as they did to you. I &s;hall now give a &s;hort account of them, not for your information, for you mu&s;t certainly have read Benezet before you ridiculed him, but for tho&s;e who have no other knowledge of the Quakers but what they get <HI>from the &s;tage.</HI></P>
<P>The Quakers believe in one almighty, eternal and unchangeable God.</P>
<P>They believe in the divinity and mi&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>They believe that all men <HI>may</HI> be &s;aved.</P>
<P>They <HI>admit</HI> of grace and univer&s;al light. That is to &s;ay, that God, of his grace, makes him&s;elf known, and di&s;clo&s;es the truth, to all tho&s;e who &s;incerely de&s;ire to know it, and &s;eek after it.</P>
<P>They believe that this grace was given to Socrates, Epictetus and Seneca, and to all tho&s;e ancient Philo|&s;ophers, who joined the practice of virtue to their &s;earch after truth. By the inward light, which they follow as their guide, they mean the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>Whoever, &s;ays Benezet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a &s;hort account of the People called Quakers; their ri&s;e, religious principles, and &s;ettlement in America, by Anthony Benezet.</NOTE>, retires &s;eriou&s;ly into him|&s;elf, with a &s;incere de&s;ire to know, and to do his duty, will never fail to find there a &s;ure guide, a ray from the fountain of light, which will enlighten his under&s;tand|ing,
<PB N="27" REF="020981_0028_0FB1698D43E74098">
and teach him, with certainty, to di&s;tingui&s;h good from evil. Tho&s;e who are obedient to this light, this divine guide, whatever religion they profe&s;s, &s;oon ar|rive at the enjoyment of purity, holine&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Bible is the principal book which they read, or have recour&s;e to, for council and direction. They cannot, however, &s;ays Benezet, regard it as the word of God, becau&s;e this title belongs to Chri&s;t alone; be|cau&s;e its contents admit of different interpretations, and becau&s;e men are apt to think that nothing further is nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Concerning wor&s;hip, they have neither ceremonies nor &s;acraments, becau&s;e they &s;ay the&s;e terms are not found in the holy &s;criptures.</P>
<P>They do not believe in elementary bapti&s;m, nor the u&s;e of bread and wine, as a &s;acrament, to be e&s;&s;ential; they look upon them as types and images; and think a good life is the certain way to &s;alvation.</P>
<P>They believe in the nece&s;&s;ity of prayer, but that it &s;hould always proceed from in&s;piration.</P>
<P>They keep meetings, becau&s;e God has promi&s;ed, that where two or three per&s;ons are gathered in his name, there he is in the mid&s;t of them.</P>
<P>They undertake not to ordain either prie&s;ts, bi&s;hops or mini&s;ters, according to the hierarchy maintained in other Chri&s;tian churches.</P>
<P>They think any man pre&s;umptuous who would pre|tend to the exclu&s;ive privilege of communion with God. Every believer may become a prie&s;t and mini&s;ter. Eve|ry Quaker is a preacher, when he feels him&s;elf autho|ri&s;ed thereto by divine in&s;piration. They therefore refu&s;e paying tythes. It is, according to their prin|ciples, degrading religion, to make it a matter of com|merce; it is di&s;obeying the Supreme Being, who has &s;aid, <HI>freely ye have received, freely give.</HI></P>
<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;on, they reject the &s;cience, called theology, as commonly taught in the &s;chools, believing that it &s;erves only to produce pride and di&s;putation.</P>
<P>I &s;hall in another place &s;peak of their &s;entiments concerning war.</P>
<P>It is well known that they never &s;wear, according
<PB N="28" REF="020981_0029_0FB1698F5B58DEA8">
to the command of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>&s;wear not at all, but let your communication be yea, yea, nay, nay: for what&s;oever is more than the&s;e, cometh of evil.</HI></P>
<P>The internal police of this &s;ect is very &s;trict and rational. They have their monthly meetings, which are made up of the members of &s;uch meetings as lie contiguous; their quarterly meetings, which are com|po&s;ed of the &s;everal monthly meetings, which are neare&s;t to each other; and in like manner, their year|ly meetings, compo&s;ed of the &s;everal adjacent quar|terly meetings. If a brother behaves ami&s;s, the el|ders caution him repeatedly, and get others to do the &s;ame. If he is irreclaimable, they lay his ca&s;e be|fore the monthly meeting, where it is judged. He may, if di&s;&s;atisfied with their deci&s;ion, appeal from this meet|ing to the quarterly meeting, where he has another hearing, and from thence, if &s;till di&s;contented, to the yearly meeting, where it is finally adjudged. They are careful to avoid law &s;uits; if any Quaker is poor, or unfortunate, the &s;ociety a&s;&s;i&s;ts him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I was told, at London, of a Quaker Merchant, who whs thrice re|lieved by his friends; but failing a fourth time, he was per&s;uaded to decline trade, and had a pen&s;ion &s;ettled on him.</NOTE></P>
<P>They look on it as a duty to contribute to general charities.</P>
<P>They hold no places of office in the magi&s;tracy; but in Penn&s;ylvania they were for &s;ome time in tho&s;e offices. Perceiving, however, that it was hardly po&s;|&s;ible to adhere to their principles, among&s;t the temp|tations that occurred there, they at length re&s;olved to give them up entirely.</P>
<P>Such are the civil and religious tenets of the Quak|ers; and to their prai&s;e be it &s;poken, they could never be compelled to abandon them, even in tho&s;e coun|tries where they were without power, and per&s;ecut|ed; and they obliged no one to embrace them, where they had the power in their own hands. To prove this, I &s;hall quote two &s;triking pa&s;&s;ages, from Barclay and Penn, in their own words:&mdash;</P>

a manife&s;t proof: for &s;o &s;oon as God revealed his <HI>truth</HI> among them, without regard to any oppo&s;i|&s;ition what&s;oever, or what they might meet with, they went up and down, as they were moved of the Lord, preaching and propagating the <HI>truth</HI> in mar|ket-places, highways, &s;treets, and publick temples, though daily beaten, whipped, brui&s;ed, haled, and impri&s;oned therefore. And when there was any where a church or a&s;&s;embly gathered, they taught them to keep their meetings openly, and not to &s;hut the door, nor do it by &s;tealth, that all might know it, and tho&s;e who would might enter. And as hereby all ju&s;t occa&s;ion of fear of plotting again&s;t the government was fully removed, &s;o this their courage and faithfulne&s;s in not giving over their meeting together (but more e&s;pecially the pre&s;ence and glory of God manife&s;ted in the meeting being terrible to the con&s;ciences of the per&s;ecutors) did &s;o weary out the malice of their adver&s;aries, that often|times they were forced to leave their work undone.

<P>And now, &s;ir, forget that you have written again&s;t the Quakers, lay a&s;ide your prejudices and wittici&s;ms, retire within, and after reading the ac|count I have ju&s;t given, a&s;k your&s;elf whether the te|nets and wor&s;hip of the Quakers are &s;o very &s;tupid as you would &s;uppo&s;e them.</P>
<P>But you will &s;ay, what is the meaning of that my&s;|terious farrago about inward grace, illumination and the &s;pirit? I under&s;tand you, and might an&s;wer your que&s;tion by referring to the belief and tenets of the Catholics and Prote&s;tants, whom your cen&s;ure in|volves equally with the Quakers; but a philo&s;opher, an academician, mu&s;t be an&s;wered in a different man|ner, and I &s;hall now attempt it.</P>
<P>The words illumination, inward grace, extacy, en|thu&s;ia&s;m, expre&s;s the &s;ame &s;piritual &s;tate of man, that &s;tate in which he is plunged, when ab&s;orbed, and en|tirely taken up in a profound meditation on his rela|tion to God and man. Were you never in this &s;ituation? If not, I pity you; for it is certainly the highe&s;t &s;ource of happine&s;s, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, of enjoyment on earth. I will not attempt to de&s;cribe the effects of it&mdash;they are beyond de&s;cription. Tho&s;e delightful reveries in which the &s;oul wanders, when e&s;caped from the wretch|ed coverings which confine her; that &s;ublime and con|&s;olatory glimp&s;e of things beyond her&s;elf, beyond the globe and in a better world, is fled and gone, when we attempt to de&s;cribe it.</P>
<P>This &s;tate is to be arrived at, &s;olely, by a perfect in|ward retirement, and a &s;olitary <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By a remarkable peculiarity, it happens that enthu&s;ia&s;ts and illuminat|ed Per&s;ons are oftene&s;t found in de&s;potic governments The rea&s;on is plain, for men are there forced to live a &s;olitary life; and when we are unhappy at home, we &s;eek for a retreat el&s;ewhere; when the earth is but a place of torment, the wretched look to heaven for relief, and be|come enthu&s;ia&s;ts, becau&s;e it is un&s;afe to be citizens.

can only be reli&s;hed by tho&s;e pure &s;ouls who are lifted above the vain plea&s;ures and trifling objects of worldly ambition.</P>
<P>This &s;tate is the direct road to the knowledge of God, of real happine&s;s, and of the proper objects of man's pur&s;uit. It leads us naturally to the true means of obtaining it. The&s;e means are the public and &s;ocial virtues. From whence it follows, that the man who is continually employed in &s;elf-meditation, becomes of cour&s;e, good, tolerant, ju&s;t and beneficent&mdash;for he endeavours to approach the Divinity, and to re&s;emble him; and it is virtue alone that can fill up the inter|mediate &s;pace which &s;eparates them.</P>
<P>Illumination, inward grace, the holy &s;pirit of the Quakers, is nothing el&s;e but this &s;tate of knowledge, which is to be attained by meditation. They never pray without meditating&mdash;they never preach without being in&s;pired, which is always the fruit of meditation.</P>
<P>I have then proved to you, that the man who is con|tinually employed in meditation on him&s;elf, on the Divinity, and on his own duty, will naturally become a virtuous man; and, of cour&s;e, the illumination of the Quakers directs them naturally to virtue; which con|clu&s;ion is &s;upported by facts; of con&s;equence their &s;y|&s;tem is a re&s;pectable one, and making a je&s;t of it, &s;hews an ignorance of it's principles and effects&mdash;It is an of|fence again&s;t virtue.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to me that the&s;e conclu&s;ions cannot be deni|ed, however, I challenge you to do it.</P>
<P>I well know that our wits, even &s;ome of the cele|brated ones, have been very ingenious in their &s;ar|ca&s;ms on this &s;tate of illumination. But what do &s;ar|ca&s;ms prove? What ab&s;urdity may not a wit be guilty of? What virtue is &s;afe from their ridicule? Let us leave irony apart, and come to facts and rea&s;oning&mdash; Turn over Voltaire from beginning to end, the man who has, above all others, brought into repute this rage of &s;ub&s;tituting ridicule for rea&s;oning, and who has carried it even to the &s;caffold. In all his writings,
<PB N="34" REF="020981_0035_0FB169982185B210">
you will not find one &s;olid argument again&s;t illuminati|on:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To do ju&s;tice to Voltaire, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that he &s;ome|times &s;peaks well of the Quakers, though in a ludicrous manner. See the words Quakers, and Egli&s;e primitive in the que&s;tions &s;ur l' Encyclo|pedie.</NOTE> His only weapons are puns and epigrams.</P>
<P>It is with regret I mention it, but the&s;e too, are the weapons mo&s;t frequently made u&s;e of by the Count de Mirabeau, in the book which he has ju&s;t publi&s;hed again&s;t the celebrated Lavater <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Comte de Mirebeau's Letter, on Me&s;&s;rs. Caglio&s;tro &amp; Lavater, Ber|lin. 1786.</NOTE> and his followers, whom he calls the enlightened, and again&s;t illumina|tion in general.</P>
<P>But there is a di&s;tinction to be made which has e&s;ca|ped this writer, and tho&s;e who have wrote on the &s;ame &s;ubject before him, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The famous Lord Shaft&s;bury has publi&s;hed a letter again&s;t en|thu&s;ia&s;m. I have not read the Letter; but by &s;ketches of it which I have &s;een, it appears that his principal de&s;ign was to prevent the mi&s;chief threatened by &s;ome fal&s;e prophets, who wi&s;hed to &s;pread de&s;olation thro' the country, by &s;ubjecting the minds of the people. His letter &s;hould have been entitled, <HI>on fal&s;e</HI> enthu&s;ia&s;m.</NOTE> and which is daily e&s;caping the vulgar who are &s;o ready to condemn every thing above their reach&mdash;He has confounded the pretended, with the real enlightened man.</P>
<P>I agree that the pretended are the mo&s;t numerous; for whenever there appears in the world characters &s;trongly marked, who announce important truths and fix the attention of mankind, they are &s;oon &s;urround|ed and followed by a crowd of intriguing per&s;ons, who take advantage of their di&s;coveries, and who, aping their appearance, hope to dupe the credulous public, and too often are &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>The real philo&s;opher ought to make the mo&s;t vigor|ous effors to detect the&s;e infamous cheats; he ought to inveigh again&s;t hypocri&s;y and illumination, when made a trade of, but not again&s;t real illumination: For by ridiculing this la&s;t only, they are di&s;appointed in their aims, they traduce what is re&s;pectable, and treat with re&s;pect, or pa&s;s over in &s;ilence, tho&s;e things which &s;hould be condemned. They give encouragement to
<PB N="35" REF="020981_0036_0FB1699C222F2CC8">
the hypocrite, who is put on a footing with the virtuous man, and finds a &s;helter under his protection.</P>
<P>But there is, in this ca&s;e, an infallible method of di&s;tingui&s;hing the fal&s;e from the true. Whenever one of the&s;e enlightened per&s;ons has ambitious, intere&s;ted, or worldly views, you may be certain that he is only a pretender to illumination, and you &s;hould never he|&s;itate to detect the <HI>cheat.</HI></P>
<P>Philo&s;ophy too, has been the in&s;trument of cheating in the hands of the &s;ophi&s;ts. But as it would be ab&s;urd to throw on real philo&s;ophers that odium which be|longs only to the cheats who have u&s;urped this title to acquire riches or reputation, &s;o it would be unju&s;t to confound George Fox, Penn, Benezet and the re&s;t of the true Quakers, with the fal&s;e, if there are any, who, as you tell us, make u&s;e of this covering to conceal their vices and intere&s;ted views. It would be unju&s;t to confound the hone&s;t Lavater with the ad|venturers who make a trade of illumination and ex|ta&s;ies.</P>
<P>What I now &s;ay, is equally applicable to the enlight|ened Catholics&mdash;I have no doubt but Fenelon was of this number&mdash;That &s;weet anointing virtue which runs through his letters, could only be produced by conti|nued exta&s;ies&mdash;And who is there &s;o devoid of rea&s;on and feeling as to &s;ay that Fenelon was a cheat or a fool?</P>
<P>Such a man would at once condemn almo&s;t every true philo&s;opher, and e&s;pecially Rou&s;&s;eau. Read this author's dialogues with him&s;elf; they &s;eem to be writ|ten in another world: And a man who exi&s;ts in this world only, and has never been beyond it, could not have written two words of them.</P>
<P>Were I to run over the catalogue of ancient and modern philo&s;ophers, there is &s;carce one of them who has not been enlightened, and con&s;equently been looked upon as a fool by his cotemporaries; this was Plato's ca&s;e; and did not De&s;cartes appear as a mad-man, when, in the public church, and pre&s;ence of the divinity, he con&s;ecrated him&s;elf by an oath to the defence of truth. And his pupil, the famous Mal|lebranche, do not all his works bear the wonderful
<PB N="36" REF="020981_0037_0FB1699D4DAE22E0">
&s;tamp of illumination? He was the child, the man of meditation.</P>
<P>The example of the&s;e great men will be another proof, &s;ir, of what I have already demon&s;trated, that this &s;tate, far from being dangerous to &s;ociety, is on the contrary, favourable to virtue. For where &s;hall we find a more di&s;intere&s;ted character than Malle|branche, where a more &s;ublime one than Rou&s;&s;eau, where one more beneficent, or more re&s;embling the divinity, than Fenelon?</P>
<P>And let it be ob&s;erved too, that this di&s;intere&s;ted|ne&s;s, this &s;ublimity, this beneficence, were the natu|ral fruits of that habit of &s;piritual contemplation, in which man becomes <HI>ex-organi&s;ed, and ex-humani&s;ed,</HI> if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>In forming a judgment of extraordinary men, I believe we do not pay a &s;ufficient attention to their private characters; I do not mean, that this &s;hould always influence us with regard to their opinions; but it &s;hould at lea&s;t teach us to be careful in pa&s;&s;ing our judgment, and above all things, not to blacken their characters: Their virtue &s;hould apologize for their mi&s;takes, but genius can never be an excu&s;e for vice.</P>
<P>I am further of opinion, that we are too apt to condemn whatever is foreign to us, and to our way of thinking. The courage of tho&s;e who dare to &s;trike out new paths, is not held in the e&s;timation it de&s;erves. The good con&s;equences of enthu&s;ia&s;m, ex|cited by new ideas, is not &s;ufficiently felt.</P>
<P>Every kind of enthu&s;ia&s;m is attended with a move|ment, a di&s;placing of the human mind, a flight be|yond the ordinary bounds. This is the natural con&s;equence of the elements of our &s;piritual princi|ciple, of it's re&s;tle&s;s activity, of it's curio&s;ity to know what is true, and to enjoy the be&s;t. This active di&s;|po&s;ition, often leads the &s;oul a&s;tray into errors and chimeras; but on the other hand, it often leads to the di&s;covery of u&s;eful truths. To &s;top the cour&s;e of enthu&s;ia&s;m then, by ridicule, is to limit the num|ber of truths, and to circum&s;cribe human perfection.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="020981_0038_0FB1699ECC782380">But further, the cau&s;e of tyranny is &s;erved by this kind of ridicule; for &s;ince there are among&s;t the&s;e truths which have been, or may be di&s;covered, &s;ome that might prove fatal to it; it is the intere&s;t of ty|rants to oppo&s;e that enthu&s;ia&s;m which cau&s;es them to be di&s;covered, &s;pread and adopted. Tyrants, by pur|&s;uing this &s;y&s;tem, would make man a mere machine. A Nero, were he now alive, would look with terror upon the pre&s;ent &s;tate of mens' minds. He would regard them with horror, agitated by a &s;ecret fer|ment, continually &s;eeking to change their &s;ituation, tor|mented with the weight they feel, and endeavouring to free them&s;elves from it. He would &s;ee, with horror, &s;ome launching into the regions of metaphy&s;ics, and there boldly hovering between heaven and earth; others penetrated with a &s;en&s;e of the dignity of <HI>man,</HI> are &s;hocked at the attempts of individuals, to degrade it, all moving with the &s;ame enthu&s;ia&s;m, boldly main|taining their doctrines, and giving ri&s;e to di&s;cu&s;&s;ions which tend to the public improvement.</P>
<P>As tyranny is continually ob&s;tructing the progre&s;s of knowledge, the &s;imple and ob&s;cure individual who re|&s;i&s;ts it, mu&s;t have a &s;upport, and none &s;o certain as enthu&s;ia&s;m&mdash;Armed with the inward conviction that he is the defender of truth, rai&s;ed above all fear, be|cau&s;e he is continually rai&s;ed above all earthly things; the enthu&s;ia&s;t gives a &s;hock to the mind, while he him|&s;elf remains immoveable.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Do you think, &s;ir, that truth would long maintain it's ground again&s;t tyranny, in a per&s;on of an indifferent turn of mind? If Phalaris had or|dered a Geometrician to &s;ay that two and two made five, he would cer|tainly have been obeyed. But in&s;tead of Geometry, let us &s;uppo&s;e the matter in que&s;tion, to have been of a nature, more clo&s;ely connected with the dignity of man, and more &s;u&s;ceptible of enthu&s;ia&s;m, the tyrant would then have found his mi&s;take.</NOTE></P>
<P>His exi&s;tence is a real benefit to the community that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es him; he in time makes them partakers of his exalted &s;tate. And indeed, enthu&s;ia&s;m, tran&s;porting the minds of men into a more exalted &s;phere, habituates them to a certain elevation, which they pre&s;erve when they de&s;cend into the common circle of things. The en|thu&s;ia&s;t,
<PB N="38" REF="020981_0039_0FB169A043897CB0">
the enlightened man, have not the &s;ame language nor the &s;ame phy&s;iognomy as common men. Theirs is an heavenly language, a noble countenance, which mo&s;t forcibly electrines tho&s;e who look upon it. Ob&s;erve the man who has frequent communion with him&s;elf and with his God&mdash;Serenity reigns on his vi&s;|&s;age and happine&s;s in his life; there is a &s;omething commanding in his looks, which &s;eems to make you feel your inferiority&mdash;In his pre&s;ence vanity &s;hrinks, vice blu&s;hes, and feeble virtue grows &s;trong. Thus, the real and virtuous enthu&s;ia&s;t, governs a whole commu|nity by his pre&s;ence, and by a firm and &s;teady <HI>re&s;olu|tion.</HI></P>
<P>You, &s;ir, who have &s;tudied the &s;ecrets of magneti&s;m, and who have boldly ranked your&s;elf among&s;t it's defen|ders, in &s;pite of the academic confederacy, you mu&s;t be well acquainted with the &s;ingular effects of this <HI>re|&s;olution,</HI> this beneficent enthu&s;ia&s;m, in which the whole &s;y&s;tem of magneti&s;m con&s;i&s;ts. Be no longer, then, the enemy of enthu&s;ia&s;ts and enlightened per&s;ons; make a je&s;t of them no longer. I have but one word more to &s;ay on this head: If the progre&s;s of George Fox and William Penn had been checked by ridicule, what a mi&s;|fortune would it have been for mankind! The Ame|rican Indians would &s;till be ma&s;&s;acred; the Negroes would &s;till be &s;laves; the principles of equality and their con&s;equence, democracy, would not have been &s;o well known, and the American revolution would not have been effected: And all this is owing to the &s;pirit of illumination and enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>No longer vilify the wor&s;hip of the Quakers, becau&s;e you think it gloomy and clowni&s;h. It is &s;imple, and of con&s;equence more re&s;pectful to the Deity. It turns the minds of men from idolatry, and by confi|ning them to a &s;tate of meditation, fixes their &s;erious attention on the &s;upreme being, which is of much greater importance than &s;inging his prai&s;es by rote.</P>
<P>No longer &s;peak &s;o highly of the Church of Eng|land's mode of wor&s;hip, for the re&s;emblance you &s;aw in it to an opera; for the fine pulpit, beautiful organ, hand&s;ome mini&s;ter, and elegant women; or for the
<PB N="39" REF="020981_0040_0FB169A1EA037288">
agreeable &s;onatas you heard &s;ung there. Good hea|vens! compare a church to a playhou&s;e; and the eja|culations of the devout man to the Divinity, to Italian &s;ongs! How could you de&s;cend to &s;uch puerile and in|decent compari&s;ons? It is excu&s;able in a child to be captivated by fine play-things, but how mean an opini|on mu&s;t we entertain of the judgment and metaphy|&s;ics of a man grown, an academician too, who calls him&s;elf a philo&s;opher, to &s;ee him looking after and admiring nothing el&s;e in divine wor&s;hip, but the dre&s;s of the ladies and the elegant theatrical grace of a &s;urplu&s;ed Petit-maitre. For what mu&s;t be your idea of the Divinity, if you &s;uppo&s;e that the prayers and homage of a hand&s;ome mini&s;ter and well-dre&s;&s;ed wo|men, are more acceptable to him, than tho&s;e of vir|tuous men, with plain clothes; or that charming &s;ongs are more acceptable than good works? At any rate, this &s;en&s;ual ta&s;te, can only belong to the indolent and voluptuous deities of Epicurus, but the God of the philo&s;opher is the &s;ource of all truth and virtue. Does he not receive a more acceptable homage from tho&s;e who &s;eek truth by meditation, and practi&s;e virtue, than from &s;inging and dancing. And is it not uttering bla&s;phemy again&s;t him, if it were po&s;&s;ible to do &s;o, thus to &s;uppo&s;e he can be wor&s;hipped by &s;tage-players and buffoons?</P>
<P>I by no means charge you with making &s;uch con|clu&s;ions, but would-be-wits, and weak minds, will draw them from your je&s;ts&mdash;How diverted they will be with your curious quotation from the De&s;erter, and that compari&s;on between the ignorant &s;ectary and Montauciel, who finds in his book, words that were never there.

<P>Which is as much as to &s;ay, that <HI>becau&s;e</HI> Montau|ciel, who did not know his letters, could not read, &s;o we have no method of becoming ver&s;ed in the &s;ci|ences; <HI>and con&s;equently,</HI> that we are not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of rea&s;on, inward feeling or con&s;cience, tho&s;e three guides of knowledge and conduct. That, in religious matters, it is a million to one, that the truth is yet concealed, that the true religion is yet unknown, and like to be &s;o, for there is a million of chances again&s;t it. Now is &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem as this defen&s;ible?

<P>Is there any more appearance of rea&s;on, in your traducing the Quakers, by charging them with bloody di&s;putes, and by &s;aying that it is better to leave them in their error than to go to cutting throats with them? How is this? do the Quakers endeavour to convince or gain over any one? And do they, when re&s;i&s;ted, wield the &s;word, or light the faggot?

<P>Philo&s;ophers, by being too warm in their oppo&s;i|tion to certain religious prejudices, have not yet &s;uffi|ciently con&s;idered the exten&s;ive influence which a be|lief in God and a future &s;tate, would have on political con&s;titutions: He who believes in God, can fear nobo|dy: He who believes in God, will &s;peak the truth bold|ly, he will de&s;pi&s;e torments and death it&s;elf: He who believes in God, will love and cheri&s;h all mankind, he will, if po&s;&s;ible, revenge them when oppre&s;t: He who believes in God, may become a Cato, a Sidney, a Benezet, the greate&s;t and mo&s;t re&s;pectable of hu|man beings, but he can never become a Cae&s;ar or a Sejancus.</P>

<HEAD>On the <HI>POLITICAL PRINCIPLES</HI> of the <HI>QUAKERS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Have you been more &s;ucce&s;sful or ju&s;t, &s;ir, in your attack upon the political or civil principles of the Qua|kers? I think not. One of them claims the favour and encouragement of all &s;overeigns. They are eve|ry where re&s;pectful and obedient to government, and never revolt, or have recour&s;e to arms, whatever im|po&s;itions they &s;uffer. You do not reproach them for this principle of forbearance, which, perhaps &s;ingly, prevents crowds of virtuous, but brave men, from embracing their &s;y&s;tem; but you are offended, be|cau&s;e in con&s;equence of it, they pro&s;cribe war, and that military art you &s;o ardently admire.</P>
<P>"Concealing, &s;ay you, their indifference for <HI>the public good,</HI> under the appearance of religion, they are &s;paring of blood, <HI>e&s;pecially their own,</HI> &amp;c."</P>
<P>Thus, &s;ir, you mi&s;apply words, which ill under|&s;tood, beget ab&s;urd and bloody conte&s;ts. If the di&s;|putes of princes, or the re&s;pective national preten&s;i|ons, often &s;upported with the unnece&s;&s;ary effu&s;ion of blood, con&s;titute what you denominate public good; it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that the Quakers are indifferent to &s;uch follies, and refu&s;e to contribute to them. But in re&s;pect to the general benefit of &s;ociety, that is to &s;ay, the relief of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed individuals, the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the indigent, zeal and liberality in the pro|motion of u&s;eful in&s;titutions, the Quakers, far from being indifferent, are among the fir&s;t to comfort and a&s;&s;i&s;t the unfortunate. For proof, I oppo&s;e you to your&s;elf, I quote you for all you allow them to have done for the public good at Philadelphia, where they have principally planned and &s;upported many u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary in&s;titutions. For, notwith&s;tanding they di&s;|courage public &s;pectacles, you will allow that they may promote the welfare of their fellow-citizens, without entertaining them with an opera or a &s;tage play. I quote that Benezet, whom you cannot but e&s;teem, that Mifflin, of whom M. St. John de Creve|coeur gives us &s;uch an amiable character, that Fother|gill, who&s;e life was one continued &s;cene of great and

good actions, in a word, I quote their general eman|cipation of the Negroes. Where &s;hall we meet with &s;uch another &s;ublime in&s;tance of regard for the public good! Can you &s;uppo&s;e that the re&s;toration of milli|ons of wretched beings to life, to virtue, and to &s;oci|ety; and the abolition of the mo&s;t dete&s;table trade that ever was undertaken, a trade in human blood! Can you &s;uppo&s;e, I &s;ay, that the&s;e are objects of le&s;s importance to the public welfare than the ma&s;&s;acre of thou&s;ands of Engli&s;hmen out of patrioti&s;m?</P>
<P>Confe&s;s, &s;ir, that this kind of public &s;pirit de|&s;erves the preference, and no doubt you will be con|vinced upon &s;erious reflection, that the Quakers have &s;hewn them&s;elves friends to the public good, by taking no part as a body in the civil commotions which have laid wa&s;te and di&s;membered the Briti&s;h empire in the la&s;t and pre&s;ent centuries. What! would you blame them becau&s;e they did not pray for the &s;ucce&s;s of that tyrant Charles II, uncorrected by the misfor|tunes of his father, who&s;e wars only &s;erved him for a pretence to rob his &s;ubjects of money to lavi&s;h upon his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es? For the ambitious William, who ca&s;t the fir&s;t link of that oppre&s;&s;ive chain of national debt, who&s;e weight becomes at pre&s;ent too heavy to be borne? For Ann &s;ucce&s;&s;ively governed by ambitious or ob&s;cure favorites, uninformed, intriguing, and a &s;tranger to her &s;ubjects? For the ab&s;urd di&s;pute about the Spani&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, or that of the empire no le&s;s ab&s;urd and expen&s;ive? In &s;hort, would you blame them for not having joined with Clive to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate Nabobs, who had been the benefactors of his country, with Verel&s;t, to hurry three millions of Indians into eternity by the cruel death of famine, with Ha&s;tings, to exterminate a hundred thou&s;and Rohillas; in &s;hort, with all the ravages of India, to rob, fetter, ma&s;&s;a|cre the mo&s;t mild, virtuous and friendly people upon earth.</P>
<P>If this ma&s;s of national enormities, is what you call public good, it is not only a virtue not to &s;tain our hands with it; it is a duty to avoid it&mdash;confe&s;s, &s;ir, that &s;uch public good is merely that of a few in|dividuals, of the mini&s;try, of the military, who for

But &s;uch public good is a general evil, an evil for all nations, and e&s;pecially to the people, who are always oppre&s;&s;ed, whether con|quering or conquered. Let us then commend the Quakers for their indifference to &s;uch nominal public good; let us commend them for weeping over its ca|lamitous con&s;equences, though they never contribute to them, and thus uniting religion and humanity.</P>
<P><HI>They are &s;paring of blood</HI>&mdash;&s;o much the better&mdash;Are there not enough who lavi&s;h it? Are not a million of bayonets at our brea&s;ts from one end of Europe to the other, &s;ufficient? Are there not murderers enough?

<P>The&s;e enlightened men, fully convinced that the ba&s;is of univer&s;al happine&s;s is univer&s;al peace, and that war mu&s;t be utterly renounced to introduce it. Convinced that preaching would be ineffectual, if not &s;econded by example, and that princes would find the means of perpetuating war as long as men could be hired to cut each others throats, determined never to u&s;e arms or contribute to the &s;upport of any war. They have been robbed, impri&s;oned, tortured, martyred; they endured it all, and at length, over|come by their con&s;tancy, tyranny has exempted them from military &s;ervices, and is obliged to u&s;e force in obtaining contributions from them. And indeed what &s;hould the Quakers pay for? To hire &s;oldiers? They would there were none. Prie&s;ts? they do not want any; they are all prie&s;ts. Magi&s;trates? they need none, they have no law-&s;uits.</P>
<P>What would become of our heroe's, if every &s;ect had imbibed this anti-military &s;pirit; if all anathema|tized war; if no Automaton would &s;uffer him&s;elf to be trained up for the infernal ta&s;k of murdering his bro|ther? &mdash;What would become of the ambition of con|querors, if all men, turned Quakers, &s;hould firmly, and with one con&s;ent, refu&s;e to &s;econd their preten|&s;ions with a mu&s;ket?

<P>Fir&s;t let me repeat your longe&s;t &s;ection relative to that people.</P>
<P><Q>Below this cla&s;s of inhabitants, (the whites of no property, in Virginia,) we mu&s;t rank the Negroes, who would be &s;till more to be pitied, if their <HI>natu|ral in&s;en&s;ibility did not in &s;ome mea&s;ure alleviate the wretchedne&s;s in&s;eparable from &s;lavery.</HI> Seeing them ill lodged, ill clothed, and often overcome with la|bour, I concluded that their treatment had been as rigorous as it is el&s;ewhere. Notwith&s;tanding I have been a&s;&s;ured that it is very mild, compared to what they &s;uffer in the Sugar Colonies. And indeed one does not hear <HI>habitually,</HI> as at Jamaica and St. Do|mingo, the &s;ound of whips, and the outcries of the wretched beings, who&s;e bodies are torn piece meal by their &s;trokes. It is becau&s;e the people of Virginia are commonly milder than tho&s;e of the Sugar Colonies, which con&s;i&s;t chiefly of rapacious men, eager to ama&s;s fortunes, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and return to Europe. The produce of their labours being al&s;o le&s;s valuable, their ta&s;ks are not &s;o rigorou&s;ly exacted, and in ju&s;tice to both, it mu&s;t be allowed that the Negroes them|&s;elves are le&s;s treacherous and thievi&s;h, than they are in the I&s;lands: for the propagation of the black &s;peices being very con&s;iderable here, mo&s;t of them are born in the country, and it is remarked that the&s;e are in general <HI>le&s;s depraved</HI> than tho&s;e import|ed from Africa. Be&s;ides, we mu&s;t do the Virgini|ans the ju&s;tice to remark, that many of them treat

their Negroes with a great deal of humanity, and what is &s;till more to their honor, they appear &s;orry there are any among them, and are forever talking of aboli&s;hing &s;lavery, and falling upon &s;ome other mode of improving their lands, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><Q>However this may be, it is fortunate that differ|ent motives concur to deter mankind from exerci&s;|ing &s;uch tyranny, at lea&s;t upon their own &s;pecies, if we cannot &s;ay, &s;trictly &s;peaking, <HI>their equals;</HI> for the more we ob&s;erve the Negroes, the more we are con|vinced that the difference between us <HI>does not lie in the colour alone,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Enough upon this &s;ubject, which has not e&s;caped the attention of the politicians and philo&s;ophers of the pre&s;ent age: I have only to apologize for treating it without declaimation; but I have al|ways thought, that eloquence can only influence the re&s;olutions of the moment, and that every thing which requires time, mu&s;t be the work of rea&s;on. And be&s;ides, it will be an ea&s;y matter to add ten or twelve pages to the&s;e few reflections, which may be con&s;idered as a concert compo&s;ed only of prin|cipal parts, <HI>con corni ad libitum.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Upon reading this pa&s;&s;age attentively, I was &s;ur|pri&s;ed to find it contain a &s;ingular mixture of contra|dictory principles, and in the &s;ame breath, the &s;enti|timents of a philo&s;opher and of a coloni&s;t; of an ad|vocate for the Negroes, and of their enemy.</P>
<P>It is evident that as a philo&s;opher, and a friend to humanity, you are inclined to alleviate the lot of the Negroes, and commend tho&s;e who do &s;o; but this tenderne&s;s it&s;elf conceals a &s;ubtile venom that ought to be expo&s;ed. For you only be&s;tow your pity upon the Negroes, while you owe them, if you are a philo&s;o|pher, vindication and defence; you wi&s;h their ma&s;ters to be humane; they ought to be ju&s;t. In&s;tead of prai&s;ing &s;uch humanity, you ought to have blamed them for &s;topping there, in &s;hort, &s;uch a contempt for the Negroes pervades this whole article, as will nece&s;&s;arily encourage their tormentors to rivet their

chains. Is not this contempt ob&s;ervable, for in&s;tance, in the very fir&s;t period?</P>
<P>"Below this cla&s;s of inhabitants (the meane&s;t whites of Virginia) we mu&s;t rank the Negroes, who would be &s;till more to be pitied, if their <HI>natural in|&s;en&s;ibility did not in &s;ome mea&s;ure alleviate the wretched|ne&s;s in&s;eparable from &s;lavery.</HI>"</P>
<P>And who told you, Sir, that nature had created the Negroes with le&s;s feeling than other men? do you judge &s;o becau&s;e they have vegetated for three cen|turies in European fetters, and at this day have not <HI>altogether</HI> &s;haken off the horrid yoke? But do not their frequent ri&s;ings, and the cruelties they from time to time retaliate upon their ma&s;ters, give the lie to this natural in&s;en&s;ibility? for an in&s;en&s;ible being has no re&s;entment. If he does not feel, how &s;hould he remember? Do you think the wretched Indians, who, &s;ince the di&s;covery of the new world, are bu|ried in the mines of Peru, are al&s;o naturally in&s;en&s;i|ble, becau&s;e they &s;uffer patiently?</P>
<P>You calumniate nature in making her grant fa|vours to particulars; in giving her a &s;y&s;tem of ine|quality among her offspring. All men are ca&s;t in the &s;ame mould&mdash;The varieties which di&s;tingui&s;h in|dividuals, are the &s;ports of chance, or the re&s;ult of different circum&s;tances; but the black comes into the the world with as much &s;en&s;ibility as the white, the Peruvian, as the European.</P>
<P>What then degrades this natural and moral &s;en&s;i|bility? The greater or le&s;s privation of liberty; in pro|portion as man lo&s;es it, he lo&s;es the powers of &s;en|&s;ation; he loo&s;es the man; he &s;ickens or becomes a brute. It is &s;lavery alone which can reduce a man to a level with the brute creation, and &s;ometimes de|prives him of all &s;en&s;ibility; but you blame nature, that kind parent, who would have us all equal, free and happy, for the crime of &s;ocial barbarity, and you pa&s;s by this crime, to extenuate another, to extenuate the horrid torments of &s;lavery! Not &s;atisfied with violating nature, by abu&s;ing her offspring, even in her name, you encourage &s;lave-holders to torment them.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="020981_0055_0FB169BF018F75B8">Do you not arm their tyrants, when you tell them, the in&s;en&s;ibility of the Negroes alleviates their tor|ments?</P>
<P>What! becau&s;e greatne&s;s of &s;oul rai&s;ed Sidney a|bove the terrors of death, the infernal Jefferies <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This Jefferies was the mo&s;t infamous Chief Ju&s;tice that ever exi&s;t|ed in England.

<P>I often quote the Hi&s;tory of England; unhappily for us it is too little known in France.</P></NOTE> who cau&s;ed his execution, was le&s;s guilty! becau&s;e the Quakers appeared in&s;en&s;ible to in&s;ults, blows, or puni&s;hments, they are le&s;s to be pitied, and it was right to martyr them! A dangerous notion, who&s;e con&s;equences I am &s;ure you would di&s;approve. If this in&s;en&s;ibility with which you reproach the Ne|groes mitigated the cruelty of their ma&s;ters, it were well: but their tormentors do not wi&s;h them not to feel; they would have them all feeling, for the plea|&s;ure of torturing them; and their puni&s;hments are increa&s;ed in proportion to their in&s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>"Seeing the Negroes, &s;ay you, "ill lodged, ill cloathed, and often overcome with labour, I conclu|ded that their treatment had been as rigorous as it is el&s;ewhere. Notwith&s;tanding I have been a&s;&s;ured that it is very mild, compared to what they &s;uffer in the Sugar Colonies."</P>
<P>Why this compari&s;on, which &s;eems to in&s;inuate a ju&s;tification of the Virginians? does a misfortune cea&s;e to be &s;uch, becau&s;e there is a greater el&s;ewhere? Was Cartouche le&s;s dete&s;table becau&s;e Brinvilliers had exi&s;ted before him? Let us not weaken by com|pari&s;ons the idea of criminality, nor le&s;&s;en the atten|tion due to the mi&s;erable, this were to countenance the crime. The Negroes are ill lodged, ill cloathed, oppre&s;&s;ed with labour in Virginia: this is the fact, this is the offence. It matters not whether they are wor&s;e treated el&s;ewhere; in whatever degree they are &s;o in Virginia, it is &s;till outrage and inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>And again, why are the Negroes of Virginia le&s;s
<PB N="55" REF="020981_0056_0FB169C0DF4A8368">
cruelly treated? Humanity is not the motive, it is be|cau&s;e covetou&s;ne&s;s cannot obtain &s;o much from their la|bours, as in the Sugar I&s;lands. Was it otherwi&s;e, they would be &s;acrificed to it here, as well as there; how can we prai&s;e &s;uch forced humanity? how, on the contrary, not give vent to all the indignation, which mu&s;t naturally ari&s;e in every feeling mind?</P>
<P>"And to do ju&s;tice to both, you add, if the Vir|ginians are not &s;o &s;evere, it is becau&s;e the Negroes them&s;elves are le&s;s treacherous and thievi&s;h than in the i&s;lands, becau&s;e the propagation of the black &s;pe|cies being very con&s;iderable here, mo&s;t of the Ne|groes are born in the country, and it is remarked, that the&s;e are in general le&s;s depraved than tho&s;e imported from Africa."</P>
<P>Here is a &s;trange confu&s;ion of cau&s;es and effects, and a &s;trange abu&s;e of words. Fir&s;t let us clear up the facts. Here are &s;ome valuable ones for the cau&s;e of the Negroes.</P>
<P>You &s;ay they are not &s;o thievi&s;h in Virginia, pro|pagate fa&s;ter, and are le&s;s depraved: Why? Becau&s;e they are le&s;s cruelly treated&mdash;Here is the cau&s;e and the effect, you have mi&s;taken one for the other.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t conclude from this fact, that if the Vir|ginians were no longer &s;evere, and &s;hould treat the blacks like fellow-creutures, they would not be more vicious than their white &s;ervants.</P>
<P>The degree of oppre&s;&s;ion is the mea&s;ure of what is improperly called the viciou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;laves.&mdash; The more cruel their tyrants, the more treacherous, villainous and cruel are the &s;laves in return&mdash;Can we wonder that Macronius &s;hould a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate his ma|&s;ter Tiberius? This viciou&s;ne&s;s is a puni&s;hment that heaven inflicts upon tyranny.</P>
<P>Can the efforts of a &s;lave for the recovery of his liberty, be denominated vicious or criminal? From the moment you violate the laws of nature, in regard to them, why &s;hould not they &s;hake them off in their relative duties to you? You rob them of their liberty, and you would not have them &s;teal your gold! You whip and cruelly torment them, and expect them not

to &s;truggle for deliverance! You a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate them eve|ry day, and expect them not to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate you once! You call your outrages, rights, and the courage which repul&s;es them, a crime! What a confu&s;ion of ideas! what horrid logic!</P>
<P>And you, &s;ir, a humane philo&s;opher! are acce&s;&s;ary to this inju&s;tice, by de&s;cribing the blacks in the &s;tyle of a dealer in human fle&s;h! You call what are no more than natural con&s;equences of the compre&s;&s;ion of the &s;pring of liberty&mdash;treachery, theft and depravation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mo&s;t authors who have not deeply &s;tudied the rights of men, fall into this error. I have remarked el&s;ewhere [Vol. II. of the Journ. du Lic&eacute;e, no. 4, page 222.) that a writer, who notwith&s;tanding. de&s;erves our e&s;teem, for having written again&s;t the de&s;poti&s;m of the Turki&s;h go|vernment, has &s;uffered him&s;elf to be drawn into it. M. le Baron de Tott &s;ays, that the Moldavians are thievi&s;h, mean, and faithle&s;s. To tran&s;late the&s;e words into the language of truth, we mu&s;t &s;ay, the Turks, the ma&s;ters of the Moldavians, are unju&s;t, robbers, villains, and tyrants; and that the Moldavians revenge them&s;elves by oppo&s;ing deceit to op|pre&s;&s;ion, &amp;c. Thus, the people are almo&s;t every where wrongfully ac|cu&s;ed.</NOTE>. But can a natural con&s;equence be criminal? Remove the cau&s;e, or is it not the only crime?</P>
<P>For my part, &s;ir, I firmly believe, that the barba|rities committed by the Negroes, not merely again&s;t their ma&s;ters, but even again&s;t others, will be attribut|ed at the bar of eternal ju&s;tice, to the &s;lave-holders, and tho&s;e infamous per&s;ons employed in the Guinea trade. I firmly believe, that no human ju&s;tice has the right of putting a Negro &s;lave to death for any crime whatever, becau&s;e not being free, he is not &s;ui juris, and &s;hould be regarded as a child or an idiot, being almo&s;t always under the la&s;h. I be|lieve that the real criminal, the cau&s;e of the crime, is the man who fir&s;t &s;eized him, &s;old him, or en&s;laved him&mdash;And if ever I &s;hould fall under the knife of an unhappy runaway, I would not re&s;ent it upon him, but upon tho&s;e white men who keep blacks in &s;lavery. I would tell them, your cruelty towards your Negroes, has endangered my life&mdash;they execrate you, they take me for a tyrant becau&s;e I am white like you, and the vengeance due to your crimes has fallen upon me.</P>
<P>God forbid, however, that I &s;hould undertake to encourage the blacks to take up arms again&s;t their
<PB N="57" REF="020981_0058_0FB169C3975EBA20">
ma&s;ters! God forbid, however, that I &s;hould under|take to ju&s;tify the exce&s;&s;es to which their re&s;entments have &s;ometimes hurried them, and which have often fallen on per&s;ons who were not acce&s;&s;ary to their wretchedne&s;s! The &s;lavery under which they groan, mu&s;t be aboli&s;hed by peaceable means; and thanks to the active &s;pirit of benevolence which animates the Quakers, the prious undertaking is already begun. In mo&s;t of the United States of America, the yoke has been taken from their necks; in others the Gui|nea-trade has been prohibited. Societies have been formed both at Paris and London, to collect and cir|culate information upon this intere&s;ting &s;ubject, to induce the European governments to put a &s;top to the Negro trade, and provide for their gradual eman|cipation in the We&s;t-India i&s;lands: No doubt &s;ucce&s;s will crown their views, and the friends of liberty will enjoy the &s;atisfaction of communicating its ble&s;&s;ings to the blacks.</P>
<P>But the blacks mu&s;t wait for the happy moment that &s;hall re&s;tore them to civil life, in &s;ilence and in peace; they mu&s;t rely upon the unwearied diligence and zeal of the numerous writers who advocate their cau&s;e, and the efforts of the humane to &s;econd their endea|vours; they mu&s;t &s;trive to ju&s;tify and &s;upport the argu|ments that are adduced in their favour, by di&s;playing virtue in the very bo&s;om of &s;lavery; they mu&s;t en|deavour, in a word, to render them&s;elves worthy of liberty, that they may know how to u&s;e it when it &s;hall be re&s;tored to them; for liberty it&s;elf is &s;ome|times a burthen, when &s;lavery has &s;tupified the &s;oul.</P>
<P>Such blacks, therefore, as are &s;o incon&s;iderate as to be concerned in in&s;urrections, are guilty of retard|ing the execution of the general plan for their eman|cipation; for the que&s;tion is not, at the pre&s;ent day, whether a million of &s;laves ought to be &s;et at liberty, but whether they can when free, be put into a capa|city of providing for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of them&s;elves and their families. In&s;urrections, far from effecting this purpo&s;e, would de&s;troy the means. Regard, therefore, to their own intere&s;ts, if there were no
<PB N="58" REF="020981_0059_0FB169C52A9594B0">
other motive, &s;hould therefore engage the blacks to patient &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and no doubt but they will yield it, if their ma&s;ters and the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel in particular, to whom the ta&s;k of comforting and in|&s;tructing them, is committed, endeavour to prepare them for approaching freedom.</P>
<P>You &s;ir, have adopted the vulgar notion, that the Negroes born in Virginia, are le&s;s depraved than tho&s;e imported from Africa. You call the firmne&s;s which is common in the early &s;tages of their &s;lavery, <HI>greater degeneracy;</HI> they are depraved, that is, in your lan|guage &mdash;they are wicked and treacherous to tho&s;e who have purcha&s;ed them, or brought them from their own country&mdash;But in my mind, they are not depra|ved, becau&s;e the acts of violence their genius in|&s;pires them to revenge them&s;elves upon their tyrants, are ju&s;tified by the rights of nature.</P>
<P>And why are tho&s;e imported, more wicked in your opinion? In mine, more quick, more ardent in their re&s;entments? becau&s;e, not having forgotten their former &s;ituation, they feel their lo&s;s the more &s;en&s;ibly; and having &s;trong ideas, their re&s;olutions are more firm and their actions more violent, they not having yet contracted the habits of &s;lavery.</P>
<P>They &s;oon fall into that degree of apathy and in|&s;en&s;ibility, which you unju&s;tly believe to be natural to them; that is, in your language, they become le&s;s depraved; but I would &s;ay that their depravity begins with this apathy and weakne&s;s&mdash;For depravity is the lo&s;s of nature, and the want of tho&s;e virtues inhe|rent in man, courage and the love of liberty. Our readers may judge from this article, how &s;trangely writers have wre&s;ted words to condemn the&s;e unhap|py Negroes, and the unfortunate in general.</P>
<P>I do not, however, pretend to &s;ay, that the Ne|groes of Africa are all good, or even that many of them are not depraved. But is this fact to be impu|ted to them as a <HI>per&s;onal</HI> crime? Ought you not ra|ther to have a&s;cribed it to the foreign &s;ource by which they are corrupted. Alike in them and in the whites,
<PB N="59" REF="020981_0060_0FB169C67AF02668">
the depravity of man is a con&s;equence of his wretched|ne&s;s, and the u&s;urpation of his rights, Wherever he is free and at ea&s;e, he is good; wherever the con|trary, he is wicked. Neither his nature nor the cli|mate corrupt him, but the government of his coun|try. Now that of the Negroes is almo&s;t univer&s;ally de&s;potic, &s;uch as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily deba&s;e and corrupt the Negro.</P>
<P>How much is the depravity, occa&s;ioned by the go|vernment of his country, encrea&s;ed by his &s;econd &s;lavery, far wor&s;e than the fir&s;t&mdash;for he is no longer among friends in his native land&mdash;&s;urrounded by the plea&s;ing &s;cenes of his childhood, he is among mon&s;ters who are going to live by, and trade in his blood, and has nothing before his eyes but death, or oppre&s;&s;ion equivalent to an endle&s;s puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>How is it po&s;&s;ible &s;uch horrid pro&s;pects &s;hould not fire his &s;oul? How, if chance &s;hould pre&s;ent him with arms and liberty, &s;hould he re&s;i&s;t u&s;ing them, to put an end to his own exi&s;tence, or that of his torment|ors? What white man would be le&s;s cruel in his &s;itu|ation? Truly I think my&s;elf of a humane di&s;po&s;ition, that I love my fellow-creatures and dete&s;t the effu&s;ion of blood; but if ever a villain, white or black, &s;hould &s;natch me from my freedom, my family, and my friends; &s;hould overwhelm me with outrages and blows, to gra|tify his caprice, &s;hould extend his barbarities to my wife and children&mdash;My blood boils at the thought&mdash; perhaps in a tran&s;port of revenge * * * * * * * If &s;uch vengeance would be lawful in me, what makes the Negro more guilty? Why &s;hould that be called wickedne&s;s and depravity in him, which would be &s;tiled virtue in me, in you, in every white man? Are not my rights the &s;ame as his? Is not nature our common parent? God his father as well as mine? His con&s;cience an infallible guide as well as mine? Let us then no longer make other laws for the blacks than tho&s;e we are bound by our&s;elves, &s;ince Heaven has placed them on a level with us, has made them like us, &s;ince they are our brethren and our fellow-creatures.</P>

The Negroe who killed him&s;elf when his ma&s;ter who had injured him was in his power, was &s;uperior to Epictetus, and the exi&s;tence of a &s;ingle Negro of &s;o &s;ublime a character, ennobles all his kind.</P>
<P>But how could you judge whether the blacks were different from the whites, who &s;aw them only in a &s;tate of &s;lavery and wretchedne&s;s? Do we e&s;timate beauty by the figure of a Laplander? magnanimity by the &s;oul of a courtier? or intelligence by the &s;tu|pidity of an E&s;quimaux?</P>
<P>If the traces of humanity were &s;o much weakened and effaced in the Negroes, that you did not recog|nize them, I conclude not that they do not belong to our &s;pecies, but that they mu&s;t have been cruelly tor|mented to reduce them to this &s;tate of degeneracy. I do not conclude that they are not men, but that the Europeans who kidnap the blacks, are not wor|thy of the name.</P>
<P>You con&s;ider what precautions it may be nece&s;&s;ary to take to avoid the danger which might attend a ge|neral emancipation of the Negroes.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not now enter into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this nice que&s;tion, but re&s;erve it for another work: yet I mu&s;t &s;ay in a word, that the Negroes will never be our

friends, will never be men, until they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all our rights, until we are upon an equality. Civil liberty is the boundary between good and evil, order and di&s;order, happine&s;s and mi&s;ery, ignorance and knowledge. If we would make the Negroes worthy of us, we mu&s;t rai&s;e them to our level by giving them this liberty.</P>
<P>Thus, the chief inconvenience you expect will fol|low the emancipation of the Negroes, may be avoid|ed; that although free, they will remain a di&s;tinct &s;pecies, a di&s;tinct and dangerous body.</P>
<P>This objection will vani&s;h when we intermix with them, and boldly efface every di&s;tinction. Unle&s;s this is the ca&s;e, I fore&s;ee torrents of blood &s;pilt and the earth di&s;puted between the whites and blacks, as America was between the Europeans and Savages.</P>
<P>Perhaps, and it is no extravagant idea&mdash;perhaps it might be more prudent, more humane, to &s;end the blacks back again to their native country, &s;ettle them there, encourage their indu&s;try, and a&s;&s;i&s;t them to form connections with Europe and America. The cele|brated doctor Fothergill conceived this plan, and the &s;ociety for the abolition of &s;lavery, at London, have carried it into exccution at Sierra Leona. Time and per&s;everance, will di&s;cover the policy and utility of this &s;ettlement. If it &s;hould &s;ucceed, the blacks will quit America in&s;en&s;ibly, and Sierra Leona become the centre from whence general civilization will &s;pread over all Africa.</P>
<P>Perhaps, &s;ir, you will place the&s;e thoughts upon the Negroes with tho&s;e declamations you are plea&s;ed to ridicule: But what is the epithet of declaimer to me, if I am right, if I make an impre&s;&s;ion upon my read|ers, if I dart remor&s;e into the brea&s;t of a &s;ingle &s;lave-holder; in a word, if I contribute to accelerate the general impul&s;e toward liberty.</P>
<P>You di&s;approve the application of eloquence to this &s;ubject; you think nothing can affect it but the exer|tions of cool rea&s;on. What is eloquence but the lan|guage of rea&s;on and &s;en&s;ibility? When man is op|pre&s;&s;ed, he &s;truggles, he complains, he moves our pa&s;&s;ions, and bears down all oppo&s;ition.

Notwith&s;tanding, your ob&s;erva|tions upon the Negroes, conclude with a je&s;t.</P>
<P>"It will be an ea&s;y matter, &s;ay you, to add ten or twelve pages to the&s;e few reflections, which may be con&s;idered as a concert, compo&s;ed only of princi|pal parts, <HI>"con corni ad libitum."</HI></P>
<P>I hope there is nothing cruel, becau&s;e there is no|thing &s;tudied in this connection, this incon&s;iderate manner: but how could &s;uch a compari&s;on come into the head of a man of feeling? It is the &s;ad effect of wit, as I &s;aid before; it contracts the &s;oul. Ever glancing over agreeable objects, it is unfeeling when intruded upon by wretchedne&s;s&mdash;unea&s;y to obliterate the &s;hocking idea, and elude the groans of nature, it rids it&s;elf of both by a je&s;t. The humane Benezet would never have connected this idea of harmony with the &s;ound of a Negro driver's whip.</P>

<P>And &s;o, &s;ir, you think the people of the pre&s;ent day, are a very different &s;et of beings from the peo|ple of old times, and of con&s;equence, more di&s;po&s;ed to and fit for &s;lavery&mdash;And you blame our philo&s;o|phers too, for putting the people of our day more on a level with tho&s;e of antiquity, and for a&s;&s;erting, that the only difference between them, is owing to the government they live under&mdash;Your conclu&s;ions, though not avowed, are, that the people of the pre|&s;ent day are to be kept in a &s;tate of the &s;evere&s;t thraldom&mdash;for you a&s;&s;ert that their vices and follies are more numerous, and that their depravity is irre|mediable.</P>
<P>Now, I maintain, that the&s;e &s;entiments are fal&s;e and detrimental to the people, whom you have thus tra|duced. You have already had my creed on this head.

<P>We may conclude then, that there is no more natural di&s;tinction between the ancients and mo|derns, than there is between the whites and the blacks; and that tho&s;e which do exi&s;t, are merely ac|cidental &mdash;Tran&s;port the government of Athens to Con&s;tantinople, and tho&s;e very Turks who now

appear &s;o like barbarians, would equal the Athenians in valour, patrioti&s;m and knowledge. Liberty would animate the&s;e machines. The mine is prepared, the combu&s;tibles are all ready, nothing but the &s;park is wanting.</P>
<P>Cea&s;e then to vilify the people of the pre&s;ent day; drive them not to a &s;tate of de&s;peration; but rather try to encourage them, by &s;howing them that their &s;tate of degradation is owing to a cau&s;e which may be remov|ed; and that when it is removed, they will become men.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I do not rightly under&s;tand your meaning, when you &s;ay, that the defenders of the People of our days, have been liberal of their prai&s;es to tyrants; this is &s;aying, that Locke, Sidney, Price, Rou&s;&s;eau, Helvetius and Raynal, have commended them; for the&s;e writers too, have unfortunately been of opinion, that the People of modern times will be quite on a footing with the ancients, when they &s;hall be placed in the &s;ame &s;ituation.</P>
<P>But I can clearly &s;ee, that your &s;y&s;tem is far more favourable to the real oppre&s;&s;ors of mankind; for by teaching them to con&s;ider the people of the pre&s;ent times as unworthy of liberty, and incapable of en|joying it; that the people, and mankind in general are daily degenerating, and will continue to do &s;o, even if the cau&s;e of their degeneracy were removed&mdash; I &s;ay, by teaching &s;uch pretended truths as the&s;e, you encourage their oppre&s;&s;ors to continue their &s;ervitude.</P>
<P>But your &s;y&s;tem is utterly fal&s;e; the revolution of America has clearly proved it to be &s;o: for the chief actors of this revolution, are the de&s;cendants of En|gli&s;hmen, (who were oppre&s;&s;ed by the Stuarts,) or of German &s;laves.</P>
<P>You think to exalt the Americans by putting them on a level with the Greeks and Romans: for my part, I think them va&s;tly &s;uperior to tho&s;e ancient nations; But I do not mean to prove my a&s;&s;ertion at pre&s;ent&mdash;I &s;hall now content my&s;elf with ju&s;t men|tioning my &s;entiments on this head; and on a future occa&s;ion demon&s;trate, that the men of the pre&s;ent age, &s;o far from having degenerated, will be &s;uperior to their predece&s;&s;ors, when placed in a more favourable &s;ituation.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="020981_0068_0FB169D3FB8B1290">After having decried the people of the pre&s;ent age, you go on to vilify mankind, and the dignity of man, which you look upon as merely comparative, and of cour&s;e, you reckon up the different degrees of the dignity of man.

<P>The dignity of the freeman, compared with that of the &s;lave, has at fir&s;t &s;ight, &s;omething more plau&s;i|ble in it; and yet it is a mere chimera: For by na|ture they both po&s;&s;e&s;s an equal degree of dignity; their natural rights are the &s;ame&mdash;Slavery may de|prive a man of the u&s;e of his rights and dignity, but it cannot deprive him of his title to them.

<P>But what can you mean by that &s;trange kind of dignity which you have invented to rai&s;e the whites above the blacks? What title is there to be found for this dignity and &s;uperiority? What author has men|tioned it? Have not the blacks on the coa&s;t of Gui|nea, who are robbed of their gold du&s;t, their gums, and their children, by European pilferers, as good a rea&s;on for arrogating to them&s;elves a dignity and a &s;uperiority over the whites?</P>

<P>As the military form a di&s;tinct body, they think them&s;elves &s;uperior to their fellow-citizens, e&s;peci|ally tho&s;e who are peaceable. The prejudice en|crea&s;es; it renders &s;ome in&s;olent, and deba&s;es others.</P>
<P>The military art dimini&s;hes true courage. It is to nations what fencing is to individuals. It &s;upplies the place of true courage, but does not in&s;pire it. But it is with courage only that republics mu&s;t defend them&s;elves from foreign attacks.</P>
<P>When men &s;hall be thoroughly in&s;pired with the love of liberty, and accu&s;tomed to exerci&s;e it in its full ex|tent, they will po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;pirit no military art can &s;ub|due. The man who exclaims <HI>I will die or be free,</HI> has no ma&s;ter; the nation that repeats it, is no longer en|&s;laved. A conqueror might ma&s;&s;acre them all, but he could not make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of a &s;ingle individual. Such courage does not need the &s;upport of art or fortifications<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an excellent letter of M de la Clos, upon the boa&s;ted utility of fortifications, addre&s;&s;ed to the academy, on occa&s;ion of the eulogium of Vauban.</NOTE>. It can &s;upport it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The real &s;trength of a republic, depends upon the in&s;uperable attachment of its members to liberty and their rights. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing this, the republican repels every attack, he &s;oon learns the military art, he har|ra&s;&s;es and overcomes all his enemies: Witne&s;s many of the American generals, who&s;e virtues and abilities you acknowledge. The greate&s;t part of them had ne|ver handled a mu&s;quet; they had been merchants, far|mers,

And no wonder that republicans &s;o &s;peedily acquire military &s;kill. The pre&s;ervation of their li|berties engages every faculty; a more powerful in|centive than the pay of mercenaries, or even the di&s;tinctions of European armies. This is the rea&s;on that one or two years experience, and two or three defeats, in&s;truct republicans more than twenty or thirty years &s;pent in the &s;ervice of other govern|ments<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">While we prai&s;e the Americans for their gallant defence of liberty; we mu&s;t not forget to pay the &s;ame tribute to the patriotic ardour of our own countrymen.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Animated by the love of liberty, republican &s;oldi|ers are more patient, and bear fatigue better than hi|red troops. Witne&s;s your own commendations of the American &s;oldiers, who always fought bravely, although ill paid, ill provided for, ill cloathed, and unaccu&s;tomed to the bu&s;ine&s;s. You allow that they &s;oon learned to &s;erve the artillery, that their bar|racks were of the be&s;t con&s;truction, that they were brave, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. What produced the&s;e wonders? The love of liberty. While they pre&s;erve it, they will have nothing to fear, and the military art will be u&s;ele&s;s to them.</P>
<P>They will do well to remember the battles you de|&s;cribe, not to &s;tudy the plans or circum&s;tances of them, but as &s;plendid monuments erected to liberty. If they are ever obliged to rea&s;&s;ume their arms, the &s;ame genius will in&s;pire them without this &s;tudy.</P>
<P>In a word, every individual of a republic, &s;hould be brave, &s;hould be a &s;oldier, by birth the defender of his country; but none &s;hould be &s;o by profe&s;|&s;ion.</P>

Heaven pre&s;erve tho&s;e re|publicans from &s;uch depravity!</P>
<P>Perhaps, and it is to be hoped, that the &s;atires upon the Americans, and their cha&s;te partners, with which your book abounds, will operate as an antidote to the plea&s;ing venom it contains. Satires, you will &s;ay. Yes, ca&s;t your eye over the following li&s;t, which compre|hends but a very &s;mall part of them.</P>
<P>You repre&s;ent the American women, as being lit|tle accu&s;tomed to give them&s;elves any trouble, and indifferent about every thing, except &s;ipping their tea, and keeping the hou&s;e clean. Let the reader compare this picture, with that of their virtues, drawn by St. John de Crevecoeur, who has lived &s;o long in America, and he may judge how much you wrong them.</P>
<P>Your informing them in another place, that you did not think any of them hand&s;ome, or that they danced ill, is a piece of rudene&s;s that French urbani|ty &s;hould have forbidden.</P>
<P>But your &s;atiric vein flows mo&s;t freely, when you bring an old or homely woman upon the &s;tage.

<P>This decided character, now quite lo&s;t among our writers, was univer&s;al, during the &s;ixteenth and &s;e|venteenth centuries. The civil di&s;&s;entions, which then divided the citizens into parties, and impre&s;&s;ed them with peculiar characters, influenced the writers of tho&s;e times: Each was attached to a party, and treat|ed its opponents with rigor. And this was not with|out its u&s;e: for the apprehen&s;ion of a &s;evere cen&s;ure, obliged them to be ju&s;t and accurate.

<P>It may be objected that abu&s;e proves nothing. I grant it; but it &s;erves to unma&s;k a character. What is proved by our perfidious compliments, our cutting-ironies, and our Italics e&s;pecially? Mere malice with|out any of that frankne&s;s which might palliate its ma|lignity.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, abu&s;e is too often applied to that boldne&s;s of feature, wherein the man of virtue is obliged to paint the villain.

<P>The generality of our writers pre&s;erve their mo|deration amid&s;t the&s;e &s;hocking &s;cenes: They treat even criminals and oppre&s;&s;ors, with civility and ten|derne&s;s, becau&s;e they have neither &s;pirit, nor charact|er. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Notwith&s;tanding, we mu&s;t do ju&s;tice to &s;ome late writers who have boldly defended the rights of mankind.

<P>But how rare are the&s;e habits! can &s;uch meditati|on be enjoyed amid&s;t the hurry and di&s;&s;ipation of a metropolis: yet here our geniu&s;es are &s;ent to receive that poli&s;h which is often fatal to every bold and original quality. Here they connect them&s;elves in &s;ocieties, communicate indi&s;criminately with each other, or with men of weaker minds, and thus de|ba&s;e them&s;elves. Intere&s;t or habit, accu&s;tom them to prai&s;e whatever they meet with in the&s;e &s;ocieties, and &s;o the public is deceived. Is it worth while to undeceive it? All mu&s;t live&mdash;and to live in peace, mu&s;t avoid giving offence.

<P>Perhaps you will &s;ay that all this has been in print twenty times before&mdash;granted; it has been twen|ty times true, is now &s;o for the twenty-fir&s;t time, and is &s;till nece&s;&s;ary to be repeated, for the evil re|mains unreformed. It may al&s;o be affirmed, that truth, virtue and reformation, are only to be expected from the man who devotes him&s;elf to &s;olitude and ob&s;curity. Elevated ideas, bold re&s;olutions, in a word, great characters are formed in &s;olitude; and what can be expected from &s;uch a man, but &s;everity of cen&s;ure, which, notwith&s;tanding, is by no means incompatible with kindne&s;s or urbanity. Authors &s;hould be friendly when they meet, &s;hould cheri&s;h and a&s;&s;i&s;t each other in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity, and be&s;tow their applau&s;es when merited; but they &s;hould al&s;o openly, candidly and vigorou&s;ly, oppo&s;e each other, when wrong. Thus Price and Prie&s;tly, Kirwan and Cavendi&s;h, now treat each other in England. They are friends as far as is con&s;i&s;tent with truth. Thus the patriot Jebb, treated the celebrated Charles Fox. Although inti|mately connected with him in private life, he warmly oppo&s;ed him in his writings, and in all public a&s;&s;emblies.</P>

<HEAD>POSTCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD ju&s;t fini&s;hed this letter, when a friend handed me the review of your travels, which ap|peared in the <HI>Mercure</HI> of the fir&s;t of July.</P>
<P>The following pa&s;&s;age in which the Quakers are mentioned, &s;truck me particularly: "A conver&s;a|tion with <HI>one</HI> Mr. Benezet leads the author to &s;peak of the Quakers. Some think he has not done them ju&s;tice. We al&s;o doubt whether his reproaches may be generally de&s;erved by them. The religious princi|ples of <HI>the&s;e people</HI> do not in&s;pire them with bad mo|rals, be&s;ides it appears improbable that theirs &s;hould differ from tho&s;e of their fellow-citizens, &amp;c. &amp;c."</P>
<P>I do not know the writer of this article. Whoe|ver he was, it is a&s;toni&s;hing that he &s;hould take the liberty to &s;peak in this contemptuous &s;tyle of Mr. Benezet and the Quakers. He could not be ignorant that the article <HI>one</HI> before a proper name is never &s;o applied in our language but to men of contemptible characters: he could not be ignorant, that the expre&s;&s;i|on <HI>tho&s;e people,</HI> is in&s;ulting and blends a body of valua|ble men with what we call the vulgar: If he was not ignorant, how dared this journali&s;t to make u&s;e of &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions, to de&s;cribe an individual and a &s;ociety who are equally re&s;pectable? Where is the man in all Europe, of whatever rank or birth, who is equal to Benezet? who is not obliged to re&s;pect him? How long will authors &s;uffer them&s;elves to be &s;hackled by the prejudices of &s;ociety? Will they ne|ver perceive that nature has created all men equal&mdash; that wi&s;dom and virtue are the only real criterion of &s;uperiority? Now who was more virtuous than Be|nezet? who more u&s;eful to &s;ociety, to mankind? What author, what great man, will ever be follow|ed to his grave by four hundred Negroes, &s;natched, by his own a&s;&s;iduity, his own genero&s;ity, from igno|rance, wretchedne&s;s, and &s;lavery? Who, then, has a right to &s;peak haughtily of this benefactor of men?</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the Quakers, after having con&s;i|dered the ab&s;tract here given, of their religious, moral
<PB N="86" REF="020981_0087_0FB169F5275D4158">
and political principles, it mu&s;t excite indignation, to hear them de&s;cribed under the contemptuous appel|lation of <HI>tho&s;e people.</HI> Shall nothing be honored but titles, rank, or &s;plendor? and will authors always con&s;pire with the favourers of ari&s;tocracy, to place the mode&s;t and &s;imple virtues below titles, to which they are infinitely &s;uperior? On looking over what you &s;ay again&s;t the Quakers, I &s;ee with concern that you have not only u&s;ed a like expre&s;&s;ion of contempt your&s;elf when &s;peaking of Benezet, but that you have even affected to <HI>thee</HI> and <HI>thou</HI> him in conver|&s;ation. Permit me to make a remark upon this &s;ubject, which e&s;caped me before: It is a principle of the Quakers, to reject tho&s;e ceremonious expre&s;&s;ions, which have been invented by vanity or meanne&s;s. They cannot &s;ee any <HI>natural</HI> difference in their fellow-creatures, &s;ufficient to authorize a di&s;tinction in their addre&s;s or deportment toward each other. The prac|tice of &s;aying <HI>you</HI> to a &s;ingle per&s;on, appears to them fal&s;e and ab&s;urd. Whether they are right or wrong, in this re&s;pect, it is equally certain, that plain lan|guage cannot be rude in them. They u&s;e it among them&s;elves, whatever relation they bear to each other: they u&s;e it to every body. But it does not follow, that tho&s;e who are not of their &s;ect, who have not their principles, or way of thinking, &s;hould &s;peak in the &s;ame &s;tyle to them. It would not only be very im|polite to do &s;o, but a mi&s;placed familiarity: yet plain language is not a mark of familiarity in the Quakers. Without departing from their <HI>thee</HI> and <HI>thou,</HI> they are careful to acknowledge the re&s;pect due to merit, to age, and to authority; and are decently re&s;erved in their addre&s;s to &s;trangers. They know what good breeding requires, and are plea&s;ed with re&s;pect|ful treatment as well as the re&s;t of the world: for they are at no lo&s;s to account for the affected plainne&s;s of tho&s;e who&s;e manners and principles are not con&s;i&s;tent with &s;uch behaviour. It mu&s;t appear to them either a mi&s;placed familiarity or the mi&s;take of ignorance, which being unable to comprehend the motive of their cu&s;toms, thinks to
<PB N="87" REF="020981_0088_0FB169F679C5EEA8">
flatter them by a conformity to one of the lea&s;t im|portance. Or indeed (as is mo&s;t commonly the cafe) from that contracted &s;elf-love which is mortified by &s;uch bluntne&s;s, although it is univer&s;al and without re&s;pect of per&s;ons. In a word, they are &s;en&s;ible that plainne&s;s of &s;peech is not contemptuous in them, but that it is &s;o in other people, unle&s;s dictated by friend&s;hip or con&s;angui|nity. There is another ab&s;urdity, &s;ir, in this review: its author doubts the ju&s;tice of your charges again&s;t the Quakers, becau&s;e, &s;ays he, <HI>their religious principles do not in&s;pire them with bad morals.</HI> As if any religious principles in&s;pired bad morals!&mdash;as if all the mem|bers of a &s;ect mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be hone&s;t men, becau&s;e its principles are good!&mdash;as if there had never been any Prote&s;tant or Catholic rogues, becau&s;e Prote&s;|tant or Catholic principles do not inculcate roguery! Contemptible argument! weak defence! only cal|culated to confirm the public in the idea you give of the Quakers, which it is evident that the fawn|ing or cowardly author of this article did not care to oppo&s;e.</P>
<P>Such critici&s;m is a di&s;grace to the man who under|takes to give the public the true character of a book. He &s;hould be perfectly ma&s;ter of the &s;ubject it is written upon. And, to return to the Quakers: if this writer mu&s;t give his opinion between you, he &s;hould have been well acquainted with Barclay's Apo|logy, and every other publication in their favour, but e&s;pecially the letters of M. St. John de Crevecoeur; or if he had never read them, he might have confe&s;&s;|ed his ignorance, and kept his judgment to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>If I were inclined to di&s;cu&s;s mo&s;t of the other ar|ticles in this review, it would be ea&s;y to demon&s;trate that almo&s;t all of them are &s;tamped with the &s;ame marks of frivolou&s;ne&s;s, ignorance, and adulation.</P>
<P>Every thing is prai&s;ed down to the very table of contents, perhaps, becau&s;e your dinners and &s;uppers are faithfully regi&s;tered there, and not a &s;ingle fact is critici&s;ed, not a &s;ingle idea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am a&s;toni&s;hed that he &s;hould &s;uffer your contemptuous expre&s;&s;ions &s;o liberally, and often unju&s;tly be&s;towed, to pa&s;s entirely unnoticed. For in&s;tance, I meet with the word 'babbler,' in three different places, and it is mi&s;applied in them all. A brave hatter is &s;tigmati&s;ed with it, who had for&s;aken every thing to defend the liberties of his country, and after travelling four hundred miles on foot to join the American forces, had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by a gallant action. He relates it to you very ingenuou&s;ly, and you reward his civility with the opprobrious epithets of babbler and braggart. It is applied in another place to a re&s;pectable officer, who had taken care of a poor old man that was bit|ten by a mad dog, and who&s;e good qualities might have apologized for the failing if he had been guilty of it, which does not appear to have been the ca&s;e, And la&s;tly, you apply it to the good woman who &s;heltered the unhappy girl, who&s;e &s;tory ought not to have been expo&s;ed to the world, although this babbler, as you call her, had prudence enough to an&s;wer your enquiries by replying that it would be too tedious to relate. How many more &s;uch remarks might I have made! But they were nece&s;&s;arily &s;acrificed to the important truths which I had pledged my&s;elf to defend.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="020981_0089_0FB169F80B029E68">We mu&s;t both agree, that people of quality and men of e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation have a &s;ad privilege in France; it is that of receiving nothing but in|cen&s;e. As critici&s;m is never wholly free with re&s;pect to them, this incen&s;e is never pure; and the di&s;grace of their works, &s;o pompou&s;ly announced, &s;hews them &s;ooner or later, that encomiums obtained from mean|ne&s;s, by <HI>prudential</HI> con&s;iderations, will not entitle them to the e&s;teem of their own age, much le&s;s to de&s;cend to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t give you one in&s;tance, &s;ir, of the pu&s;illanimity of writers of the lower cla&s;s towards privileged authors: it relates to your&s;elf.</P>
<P>I was lately in company, when the conver&s;ation turning upon your travels, an author related, that not long &s;ince he could not help conceiting you frowned upon him, at table, and a&s;ked the per|&s;on who &s;at next him, what could be the rea&s;on of it, who an&s;wered, M. Le Marquis de Cha|tellux believes you to be the author of the article again&s;t his travels, in the <HI>Corre&s;pondence Lit|teraire Secrette:</HI> he has been told that you write for it. For Heaven's &s;ake undeceive him directly; I have no hand in it; I did not write that article. Why need you deny it &s;o warmly? replied I; the work may de&s;erve critici&s;m. That may be, rejoins my gentleman; but I would not attack M. de Cha&s;tellux;

he has the ear of M. de Monte&s;quieu, who is in fa|vour with Mon&s;ieur the King's brother: it would be the ruin of me; I have a wife and children to provide for. Well, &s;ir, replied I, I am a father and a hu&s;band as well as you, but I will critici&s;e the&s;e travels, and that openly: for I have too good an opinion of M. le Marquis de Chatellux not to believe, that if I &s;hould be per&s;ecuted for it (which but to &s;uppo&s;e, were ab&s;urd and injurious to the per&s;ons you mention) he would him&s;elf be the fir&s;t to defend me. Indeed it appears to me, that every judicious man, who regards his own intere&s;t, &s;hould be of the opinion of Lycurgus upon public di&s;cu&s;&s;ions. This pa&s;&s;age of Plutarch is &s;o &s;triking, and you are &s;o great a lover of antiquity, that I am tempted to tran&s;cribe it entire.</P>
