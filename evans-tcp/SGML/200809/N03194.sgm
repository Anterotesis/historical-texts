<P>&para; 3. This Order is the Ground of Our Complaint. There are &s;undry Things in it which we&s;hall take Notice of, in order to entitle our &s;elves to the Relief of this Honourable Hou&s;e: The publick Intere&s;t of this Colony is greatly concerned in the Con&s;equences of this Order; and for our own Parts, we think it exceeding hard to be deprived of our Sub&s;i&s;tance, meerly for having done our Duty.</P>
<P>&para; 4. This a &s;urprizing Thing to us, that the Gentlemen who made this Or|der, could proceed the Length they have done. The good Opinion we were willing to entertain of them di&s;po&s;ed us to think, That they would never have done their Country and us &s;o great an Injury. Could any Man have thought, that they would have <HI>denyed the Subject a Liberty to take an Exception to their Commi&s;&s;ions, when his Right to do &s;o, is &s;o clearly founded in Rea&s;on and Law?</HI> He mu&s;t be but little acquainted with the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> who could po&s;|&s;ibly make a Doubt, <HI>Whether the Subject had &s;uch a Right?</HI> But the&s;e Gentle|men, without Que&s;tion, had &s;een that Matter fully treated of in the Ca&s;e of Mr. <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n Dam,</HI> in his Plea to the Juri&s;diction of the Ju&s;tices of the Supream Court, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">oceed in a Cour&s;e of Equity. The Argument on that Head had been de|livered to one or both of them in Manu&s;cript, before the Day appointed for hearing thereof, and had been long printed before they made the above&s;aid Order. In that Argument, from <HI>page</HI> 14, to 35, <HI>the Right of the Subject to take
<PB N="4" REF="003864_0004_100206CDC1772EE0">
&s;uch Exception,</HI> is e&s;tabli&s;hed upon &s;uch Principles as have not yet been &s;haken, nor do we &s;uppo&s;e that the Rea&s;ons and Authorities there offered will ever be an&s;wered. The Sub&s;tance of what is there printed, would have been repeat|ed in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Zenger,</HI> had not the&s;e Gentlemen thought fit to CONDEMN <HI>us and the Exceptions</HI> UNHEARD. This &s;urprizing Method of Conduct, is not to be warranted by the Practice of any Country, but where ARBITRARY POWER prevails, and where TYRANTS rule and SLAVES obey. How un|warrantable &s;uch a Precedent, in an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court of Ju&s;tice is, and what is the plain Tendency of it among a free People, needs but little Penetration to di&s;|cover.</P>
<P>&para; 5. Nothing can be more evident, than that by the Laws of <HI>England, the Subject may in all Courts plead to the Juri&s;diction</HI> (12 <HI>Co.</HI> 53.) This was the Opinion of My Lord <HI>Coke</HI>; and if what that Oracle of the Law &s;aid, was true, it cannot but be e&s;teemed a bold Act in our Judges, <HI>not only to deprive the Sub|ject of that Right, but al&s;o to inflict one of the mo&s;t &s;evere Puni&s;hments, for their mode&s;tly claiming it.</HI></P>

<P><Q>My Lord (&s;ays Capt. <HI>Streater</HI>) this Law of <HI>England</HI> is <HI>a Law of Freedom and a Law of Freeme and not of Slaves</HI>; it is a Law that &s;etleth a Right in its Subjects.</Q></P>
<P>&para; 7. Thus has the Law and Liberty of the People, been always under&s;tood to be in our Mother Country.

<P>This &s;ingle Authority proves, not only the Right of the Subject to take &s;uch Exception to the Commi&s;&s;ions of Judges; but al&s;o &s;hews many Cau&s;es and Grounds for it. And what was here above 500 Years ago declared to be Law, was, in the Ca&s;e of Mr. <HI>Van Dam,</HI> proved by many Rea&s;ons and Authorities, to have been the Law in all pa&s;t Times; and al&s;o, that it &s;till is the Right of the Subject, and the Law of the Land to this very Day.</P>
<P>&para; 8. But as the Cau&s;e of Mr. <HI>Van Dam</HI> was <HI>a Civil Cau&s;e,</HI> and the Examples there given, to prove the Right of the Subject to plead to the Juri&s;diction, and to take Exception to a Judge's Commi&s;&s;ion, are chiefly taken from <HI>Cau&s;es of the &s;ame Nature</HI>; therefore, to bring the Matter more home to the Ca&s;e of our Client <HI>Zenger,</HI> we beg Leave to add here <HI>&s;ome modern Examples,</HI> even in <HI>cri|minal Cau&s;es,</HI> that prove the &s;ame Point. And the &s;ame Examples will al&s;o clearly prove, that a Council's &s;igning &s;uch Plea, or Exception, which he thinks pertinent to his Client's Cau&s;e, cannot, con&s;i&s;tent with Rea&s;on or Law, be termed a CONTEMPT; as has groundle&s;sly been &s;ugge&s;ted again&s;t us in the afore&s;aid Order.</P>
<P>&para; 9. But we mu&s;t fir&s;t ob&s;erve here, that it is a Rule in Pleading (as <HI>in Regula P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">itandi</HI> 56) That all &s;pecial Pleas (which tho&s;e to the Juri&s;diction particu|larly are) ought to be &s;igned by Council, otherwi&s;e it is a &s;ufficient Objection again&s;t them, (which Rule is exemplified in <HI>State Tryals, Vol.</HI> 3. <HI>pag.</HI> 229. and in <HI>Vol.</HI> 4. <HI>pag.</HI> 212, 213, 214.) From whence we may infer, that when a Plea to the Juri&s;diction, made by the Advice of Council, is offered, or received, it con&s;equently is to be e&s;teemed &s;igned by Council, tho' it is not expre&s;sly men|tioned, to be &s;igned by Council.</P>
<P>&para; 10. The fir&s;t modern Ca&s;e we &s;hall mention, is the Ca&s;e of <HI>Fitzbarris (State Tryals, Vol.</HI> 3. 229) who, in the Year 1681, was indicted of High Trea&s;on. That Man offered to plead to the Juri&s;diction of the King's Bench (who&s;e Powers our Judge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;eem to claim by the common Law) but the Judges there were &s;o far from thinking it a Contempt in him, to offer to plead to their Juri&s;diction, that they a&s;&s;igned him &s;everal of the be&s;t Council in <HI>England</HI> to draw it, and gave him three Days Time for tho&s;e Council to draw that Plea in, which Plea tho&s;e Council drew, and brought it into the King's Bench, and prayed that it might be received, and it accordingly was received, and the Attor|ney General demurred to it, and the Council for the Pri&s;oner joyned in Demurrer.</P>
<P>I believe none will &s;ay, that the Time in which this Example happened, was the mo&s;t favourable to the Liberty of the Subject; yet even then it was look'd upon to be lawful to pread to the Juri&s;diction of the King's Bench, the highe&s;t Court of Common Law of ordinary Juri&s;diction in the Kingdom; and it was not e&s;teemed any Crime or CONTEMPT for a Lawyer to &s;ign and file &s;uch Plea.</P>
<P>&para; 11. A &s;econd Example to this Purpo&s;e, is the Ca&s;e of the Lord <HI>Delamere (State Tryals, Vol.</HI> 4. 212.) who was tryed for High Trea&s;on, in the Year 
<PB N="6" REF="003864_0006_1002082BC02CBD20">
1685. a Time when Arbitrary Power threatned the De&s;truction of the Con&s;ti|tution, and which brought about that Revolution, which &s;oon followed. In that Ca&s;e the Lord <HI>Delamere</HI> offered a Plea to the Juri&s;diction of the Lord High Steward, and the Peers commi&s;&s;ioned to try him; but his Plea was ob|jected to, for want of Councils Hand to it; whereupon he prayed to have Council a&s;&s;igned him, to put it in Form, and to argue it, which was agreed to be allowed him, if he had them ready; the Lord High Steward &s;aying, <HI>If the Lord</HI> Delamere <HI>in&s;i&s;ts upon having his Council heard, it is not fit for me to re|fu&s;e bearing what they can &s;ay</HI>; and afterwards, <HI>If you in&s;i&s;t upon it to have your Council beard,</HI> GOD FORBID THAT I SHOULD DENY IT! Upon which it may be ob&s;erved, that tho' this was in the Year 1685. three Years before the Revolution, &amp; a very bad Time, yet even <HI>JEFFERYS</HI> then Lord High Stew|ard, was &s;o far from thinking Council criminal to &s;ign a Plca to the Juri&s;dic|tion, that it was allowed the Pri&s;oner to get Council to do it, and it was ob|jected to, for being without Council's Hand; and lea&s;t it may be &s;uppo&s;ed he might be <HI>Guilty of Condemning unheard,</HI> he, even <HI>JEFFERYS,</HI> in an apparent <HI>Horror</HI> at &s;uch a Thing, &s;ays, <HI>God forbid that I &s;hould deny to hear his Council!</HI></P>
<P>&para; 12. But if it &s;hould be objected, that the Pleas in the&s;e two Ca&s;es, were not to the Judges Commi&s;&s;ions, nor to the Being of tho&s;e Courts, but tended only to <HI>ou&s;t</HI> or deprive tho&s;e Courts, of the Juri&s;diction of tho&s;e particular Cau&s;es, we &s;hall offer two other Examples.</P>
<P>In the Year 1686, two Years before the Revolution, King <HI>James</HI> the &s;econd erected High Commi&s;&s;ion Courts, and made the Lord Chancellor <HI>JEFFERYS</HI> and other In&s;truments of Arbitrary Power, who&s;e Names are now infamous, to be the Judges thereof; before which Court, by Virtue of one of the&s;e Com|mi&s;&s;ions, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> was cited, for not obeying the King's Com|mand to &s;u&s;pend Dr. <HI>Sharp,</HI> for preaching again&s;t Popery. When the Bi&s;hop appeared, he demanded a Copy of their Commi&s;&s;ion. <HI>JEFFERYS</HI> told him, it was on Record, and to be bought for a Penny in every Coffee-Hou&s;e in Town; the Bi&s;hop &s;aid, he had not &s;een it, and begged &s;ome Time to ad|vi&s;e with Council what to an&s;wer; and they, <HI>even they,</HI> gave him a Week, and in five Days afterwards, he came and begged a Fortnight more, and they al&s;o gave it to him, to advi&s;e with Council. At the Time la&s;t appointed, the Bi&s;hop came with four Council, and a Plea ready drawn, to their Juri&s;diction, and offered that Plea; and the Bi&s;hop &s;aid, he was told, <HI>That to plead &s;uch Plea, was a Right every one has to make u&s;e of, when he finds it for his Advantage,</HI> and &s;ays, my Council tell me, <HI>That Tour Proceedings in this Court are directly contrary to the Statute Law, and are here to plead it, if Tour Lord&s;hips will admit them.</HI> Upon which the Lord Chancellor <HI>JEFFERYS</HI> &s;aid, <HI>We will neither hear Tour Lord&s;hip, nor Your Council, We are &s;atisfied of the Legality of Our Commi&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>Upon which it may be ob&s;erved, That tho' tho&s;e Council had advi&s;ed, &s;ign|ed, and were ready to argue in &s;upport of that Plea to their Juri&s;diction, which was to their Com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;&s;ions and whole Power; yet it does not appear, that even this infamous Chan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">llor <HI>JEFFERYS</HI> gave them the lea&s;t har&s;h Word, for &s;o doing (tho', to his p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">petual Shame, he refu&s;ed to hear the Bi&s;hop or his Coun|cil to that Plea,) but admitted tho&s;e Council afterwards to argue upon the Merits of the Cau&s;e. This appears by <HI>Vol.</HI> 3. of <HI>Kennet's</HI> Hi&s;tory of <HI>England, pag..</HI> 458. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and <HI>State Tryals, Vol.</HI> 4. <HI>pag.</HI> 846. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and Hi&s;tory of the Reign of the <HI>Stewards,</HI> 711.</P>
<P>&para; 13. The &s;econd of the&s;e Examples is in the Year 1687. one year before the Revolution, before the High Commi&s;&s;ioners, Chancellor <HI>JEFFERYS,</HI> and
<PB N="7" REF="003864_0007_1002082DEB75BB80">
others: The Ca&s;e was thus; King <HI>James</HI> the 2d commanded the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Cambridge</HI> to admit <HI>a Papi&s;t</HI> to the Degree of <HI>Ma&s;ter of Arts,</HI> which they refu&s;ed to do; and for that Contempt were cited before the High Commi&s;&s;ion. They appeared by their Vice Chancellor, and eight of their Senate. Where|upon the Vice Chancellor <HI>prayed, and bad Time to an&s;wer, with Leave to put the An&s;wer in Writing, and with Council, and by what Council be plea&s;ed.</HI> At the Time appointed they pleaded to the Juri&s;diction of the Court, both as to that particular Ca&s;e they were cited for, and as to the whole Power of the Court, by &s;etting forth the Act of 16<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t, that enacted, that no &s;uch Court as that &s;hould be afterwards held. Which Plca was received, and read, and when read, the Chancellor <HI>JEFFERYS</HI> a&s;ked, if it was &s;igned? Where|upon it was an&s;wered, <HI>Tes My Lord</HI>; and then the Matter was taken into Con|&s;ideration for a Week: But it appears not by this Ca&s;e, that even that wicked Man, the Chancellor <HI>JEFFERYS,</HI> ever &s;o much as thought, that tho&s;e Council acted ami&s;s, for advi&s;ing or &s;igning of that, or the former Plea in the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI>'s Ca&s;e: Tho' in the la&s;t Ca&s;e, to the &s;hame of that Court, <HI>JEFFERYS</HI> pronounced the Judgment of it, which was, <HI>That, as a Mark of His Maje&s;ty's and their Lord&s;hips</HI> DISPLEASURE, <HI>they thought fit to appoint, that the Vice Chan|cellor &s;hould be thenceforth deprived of that Office.</HI> All which appears in the 4<HI>th Vol.</HI> of the <HI>State Tryals,</HI> from <HI>pag.</HI> 250. to 259.</P>
<P>&para; 14. The&s;e Authorities, with what is referred to in the Argument of Mr. <HI>Van Dam</HI>'s Council, are a full Proof, that it is by Law the Right of the Sub|ject to take Exception, either to the Juri&s;diction of the Court, or the Commi&s;|&s;ion of a Judge. And if this be the Right of the Subject, how con&s;i&s;tent is it with the GREAT CHARTER to deny it to him? It is &s;aid there, <HI>Nulli negabi|mus, nulli differemus Ju&s;titiam vel Rectum. We will deny no Man, we will delay to no Man, Ju&s;tice or Right.</HI></P>
<P>Now this Law was made our Birth-Right (&s;ee My Lord <HI>Coke</HI>'s Comment. upon 2<HI>d In&s;t.</HI> 56.) And to ob&s;erve this Law, not only the King, at His Coro|nation, but all his Judges of Common Law, are or ought to be &s;worn. And if this is the Subjects Right, what Judge, without Violation of his Oath, can deny it? And how can it, con&s;i&s;tent with either Rea&s;on, Law or com|mon Sen&s;e, be termed <HI>a CONTEMPT</HI> to claim that Right? Or for Coun|cil to &s;ign and file Exceptions in Con&s;equence of that Right?</P>
<P>&para; 15. In the next Place we ob&s;erve, that the Sugge&s;tion, in the &s;aid Order, <HI>That the Exception denys the Being of the Supream Court,</HI> is altogether without Truth and groundle&s;s. Had the Supream Court no other Foundation than the Judges Commi&s;&s;ions, there might have been &s;ome Truth in that Sugge&s;tion. In &s;uch Ca&s;e, to deny the Lawfulne&s;s of their Commi&s;&s;ions, would be to deny the Being of the Court: But it is well known, that the Being of the Supream Court has a quite different Foundation.</P>
<P>&para; 16. It was, till lately, under&s;tood to have been founded on Ordinances, &s;everal of which have been made from Time to Time, either to give or con|tinue its Being, the la&s;t of which was publi&s;hed in the Supream Court, in the Pre&s;ence, and by Order, of the&s;e Gentlemen, and bears date no longer ago than the 19<HI>th March,</HI> in the &s;ixth Year of His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty's Reign. But &s;uppo&s;e it to exi&s;t or have its being <HI>by the Common Law,</HI> as &s;ome have lately imagined, and which &s;eems to be Mr. Chief Ju&s;tice's Opinion (&s;ee his Charge to the Grand Jury of 15<HI>th January,</HI> 1733. <HI>pag.</HI> 4. <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> &mdash; [whole Para|graph to] &mdash; <HI>now.)</HI> Yet in either Ca&s;e, it doth not derive its Being from 
<PB N="8" REF="003864_0008_1002065677A56838">
the Commi&s;&s;ions of the Judges, but wholly from <HI>the Ordinance,</HI> or <HI>Common Law</HI>; and therefore to deny the Lawfulne&s;s of their Commi&s;&s;ions, cannot, con&s;i&s;tent either with Truth or Rea&s;on, be called <HI>a Denyal of the Being of the Supream Court.</HI></P>
<P>&para; 17. Now the Exceptions deny only the Legality of the Judges Commi&s;|&s;ions, and neither affirm or deny any Thing, with re&s;pect to the Supream Court. But both &s;pecial Matter pleaded, and the Conclu&s;ion, are expre&s;s to that Commi&s;&s;ion, whereof Hearing was given, as will appear to any one that reads them. We in&s;i&s;ted, that the Exceptions did not deny the being of the Supream Court, at the Time that the Order was publi&s;hed, and tho' Mr. <HI>De Lancey</HI> was plea&s;ed then to acknowledge (with great Truth) That the Court might well exi&s;t, tho' the Commi&s;&s;ions of the Judges were unlawful; yet when we prayed, that the Order might be amended in that Point, our Reque&s;t was not granted, but the Order was &s;uffered to remain as it had been entred. Which Conduct in the&s;e Gentlemen, fir&s;t in declaring that the Exception <HI>denyed the Being of the Supream Court,</HI> when <HI>it did not,</HI> and making it a Ground of &s;o &s;evere a Sentence; and afterwards, when this Matter was objected to them, and it was admitted, That the Court might exi&s;t, tho' all the Com|mi&s;&s;ions were unlawful (which of it &s;elf plainly implys, that the Denial of the Legality of the Commi&s;&s;ions, was no <HI>Denial of the Being of the Supream Court</HI>) we &s;ay, after all this, &s;till to continue that Sugge&s;tion, &s;o plainly repugnant to Truth, as a Rea&s;on of their Sentence, carries with it a more heavy Imputation, than we wi&s;h we had Occa&s;ion to take Notice of.</P>
<P>&para; 18. Again, in the next place, we would humbly a&s;k, whether any Thing can be more Arbitrary, than the&s;e Gentlemen's pretending to make the Notifi|cation of their <HI>Di&s;plea&s;ure</HI> to be the Rule of our Conduct? Is not, or rather, ought not the Law to be the only Rule of their and our Duty? Indeed, had they received their Commi&s;&s;ions from the <HI>French</HI> King, who a&s;&s;igns no other Rea&s;ons for his Mandates, Writs, or Commands, than, <HI>Car tel e&s;t notre Plai&s;ir,</HI> or <HI>for &s;uch is our Plea&s;ure</HI>; they might in this Point have been excu&s;ed by the Example of their Ma&s;ter, and the Arbitrarine&s;s of his Government. But for Judges, pretending to act by Commi&s;&s;ion from the King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> who could give no Authority, but to act according to Law, and who them&s;elves were, or ought to have been &s;worn, to judge according to that Rule; for them, we &s;ay, to &s;et up their <HI>Plea&s;ure or Di&s;plea&s;ure,</HI> as a Rule of Conduct, in the Supream Court of Common Law in this Country, and avowedly to make that any part of the Rea&s;on of &s;o &s;evere a Sentence, we believe is not to be paralleled by one Example within the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Dominions, unle&s;s in &s;uch Reigns as that of King <HI>James</HI> the &s;econd, and in &s;uch Courts as the <HI>High Commi&s;&s;ion Court,</HI> or <HI>Star Chamber,</HI> and by &s;uch Judges as the cruel <HI>JEFFERYS,</HI> and others, who&s;e Names will be tran&s;mitted to the late&s;t Po&s;terity with Infamy and Re|proach. What can be more a&s;toni&s;hing in a free Country, than for Judges in the Seat of Ju&s;tice, executing the mo&s;t &s;acred Tru&s;t that is delegated by Man|kind, who in the Execution of their Offices, ought to be dive&s;ted of all Mo|tives either from <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> or <HI>Di&s;plea&s;ure, Favour</HI> or <HI>Fear</HI>; who cannot &s;uffer the lea&s;t Mixture of the&s;e, to &s;way their Judgments, or influence their Deter|minations, without Violation of their Oath and &s;acred Tru&s;t; for Men, under &s;uch &s;olemn Obligations, to do right to every Man, according to Law, for &s;uch Men, to make either their <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> or <HI>Di&s;plea&s;ure,</HI> the Rule of their Conduct! &mdash; to own it without Blu&s;hing or Remor&s;e! &mdash; nay, to record it in the Supream Court of this Province, as a Rea&s;on of &s;o &s;evere a Sentence! &mdash; It &s;eems to us &s;o &s;hocking as to leave no Room for an Apology!</P>

<P>&para; 20. The&s;e Gentlemen, in <HI>that Point,</HI> we believe are truly an Original; they &s;eem to have found out &s;ome new Law for this Young Country, and &s;uch as its ancient Mother Country has never heard of: They will not &s;uffer their Commi&s;&s;ions to be di&s;puted or tryed, whether they are legal or not, tho' the Law requires their Commi&s;&s;ions to be publi&s;hed, and the Hearing thereof gi|ven, for that very End: Indeed in this they acted not without a Precedent; The High Commi&s;&s;ion Judges, and &s;ome others that we could mention, acted in the &s;ame Manner.

as the&s;e have i&s;&s;ued in Times pa&s;t, witne&s;s the Commi&s;&s;ions to the Pre&s;i|dent and Council of the North, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (4 <HI>In&s;t.</HI> 243.) which have produced much Rum and Confu&s;ion in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation. What has been may be, and in all Probability will be, if the Example our Judges have given be drawn in|to Con&s;equence. And if &s;uch a Commi&s;&s;ion &s;hould i&s;&s;ue what Security has the Subject again&s;t being utterly ruined by it, if he may not be allowed his Excep|tion? And if he cannot take &s;uch Exception, but by the Help of a Lawyer, and his Lawyer cannot defend him again&s;t &s;uch illegal Commi&s;&s;ion, but with the Lo&s;s of his Livelihood, and the Ruin of his Family; how deplorable mu&s;t the Ca&s;e of the Subject be? How de&s;titute and helple&s;s! For what Lawyer will dare to undertake his Defence? And what Motive can induce him to it, when he knows. That the very Attempt to &s;erve his Client, will have no other Effect than his own Ruin? What a Wound is given by this <HI>Arbitrary Proceeding,</HI> to the Liberties of this Country! In con&s;equence of this Proceeding, Life, Liberty and E&s;tate, are at once &s;eized into the Hands of <HI>Arbitrary Power:</HI> For if the <HI>be&s;t Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> upon Earth is not to be di&s;puted, and Lawyers mu&s;t be &s;ilenced for daring to attempt it, then the very <HI>wor&s;t Commi&s;|&s;ion</HI> in the World may &s;oon be obtruded upon a People. For, if it be a Crime to except to a <HI>good Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> and &s;o grievous a Penalty is annexed to the do|ing of it, who will dare to except to a <HI>bad one,</HI> when no Man can know, but the Judge may declare the mo&s;t <HI>illegal Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> to be <HI>good</HI>? Such were the <HI>High Commi&s;&s;ions</HI> granted in 1686, by King <HI>James</HI> the 2<HI>d.</HI> two Years before the Revolution, and &s;uch were they declared to be, by the Stature that gave King <HI>William</HI> the Crown. But yet Chancellor <HI>JEFFERYS,</HI> and the other <HI>High Commi&s;|&s;ioners,</HI> the In&s;truments of <HI>Arbitrary Power</HI> in that Day, had the Front to de|clare. <HI>We will neither bear you nor your Council in the Matter,</HI>

How nece&s;&s;ary therefore is it, that the Guardians of our Liberties, &s;hould, in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, look diligently into the Cau&s;es of the general Dif|content, that prevails within this Colony, and in particular into this? And apply tho&s;e Remedies to the&s;e Grievances, that art within their Power; Not only as they regard that Peace and Pro&s;perity, which will naturally attend the &s;ecure Enjoyment of our Liberties, but as they would prevent the bitter Con&s;equences that may follow the Neglect of &s;o plain a Duty.</P>

<HI>any Man may renounce</HI> (if he plea&s;es) <HI>a Matter of Law in his Favour.</HI> Tis u|pon this Di&s;tinction, that our pa&s;t Conduct, in re&s;pect of our different Clients, has been diver&s;ified. In the Supream Court we never advi&s;ed an Exception but in one Ca&s;e before, and that was in the Ca&s;e of Mr. <HI>Van Dom,</HI> who excepted to the Power of the Judges to proceed according to a Cour&s;e of E|quity.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ght al&s;o to have been &s;aid.&mdash; And after|wards excepted to Judge <HI>Philip&s;e's</HI> Commi&s;&s;ion, &s;oon after the Date of it, for Per&s;ons nearby the &s;ame with the&s;e in <HI>Zenger's</HI> Exception.</NOTE> We advi&s;ed it then, becau&s;e we thought that Exception nece&s;&s;ary for his Safety, and the Good of the Country.</P>
<P>&para; 25. We advi&s;ed <HI>Zenger's</HI> Exception for the like Rea&s;on; but we have al|ways omitted it, where we &s;aw our Clients Safety did not require it. Mr. <HI>Van Dam's</HI> Exception would not be of any Service to Mr. <HI>Zenger,</HI> nor will Mr. <HI>Zenger</HI>'s Exception be of any Service to any one that &s;hall hereafter be pro&s;e|cuted in the &s;ame Manner, unle&s;s &s;uch Per&s;on will take &s;uch Exception in his own particular Ca&s;e. We ever thought it lawfull for any of our Clients, to bring the Commi&s;&s;ions of the Judges to the Touch&s;tone of the Law: But we never thought it &s;o nece&s;&s;ary as in this Ca&s;e. We conceived the Innocency of our Client, no &s;ufficient Security, while we e&s;teemed the Governour his Pro&s;ecutor, who had his Judges in his Power. We had too much Rea&s;on for Caution from the Conduct of the Chief Ju&s;tice. We heard, how His Honour had vented his Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t him, when he accidentally met him in the Streets, on a <HI>Sunday</HI> before his Arre&s;t. We had been near Witne&s;&s;es to &s;undry warm Charges, and moving Addre&s;&s;es, to &s;everal Grand Juries, plainly levelled again&s;t <HI>Zenger,</HI> and with Intention to procure his Country to Indict him. And we &s;aw his Name among&s;t that Committee of Council, which conferred with a Committee of this Hou&s;e, in order to procure a Concurrence to condemn &s;ome of <HI>Zenger's Journals,</HI> without giving him an Opportunity to defend them. We heard that the Chief Ju&s;tice was a principal Manager upon that Conference, and &s;poke much on that Occa&s;ion. We &s;aw his Name among tho&s;e who i&s;&s;u|ed that Order of the Council, which commanded the Magi&s;trates of this City to attend the Burning of &s;ome of tho&s;e <HI>Journals</HI>; and which &s;ets forth, <HI>that they bad been condemned by the Council to be burnt by the Hands of the common Hang|man.</HI> We much doubted of the Legality of the&s;e Extraordinary Proceedings, of the Chief Ju&s;tice, and the Re&s;t of the Council. We &s;aw the Chief Ju&s;tice's Name, among th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e, who i&s;&s;ued that Extraordinary Warrant, by which our Client was apprehended. We had &s;een his Want of Moderation, in demand|ing Security in <HI>Eight Hundred Pounds,</HI> when <HI>Zenger</HI> was brought before him, on his <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> tho' the Act only required Bail to be taken, <HI>according to the Quality of the Pri&s;oner, and the Nature of the Offence,</HI> and tho' at the &s;ame Time, the poor Man had made Oath before him, <HI>That be was not worth Forty Pounds, be&s;ides the Tools of his Trade, and Apparel.</HI> We had heard the Chief Ju&s;tice declare, in the fulle&s;t Court we had then ever &s;een in that Place, <HI>That if a Jury found Zenger Not Guilty, they would be perjured</HI>; or Words to that Effect; and even this before any Information in Form was lodged again&s;t him, As for Ju&s;tice <HI>Philip&s;e,</HI> we had been sold, how vigorous and Active he had been, in the General A&s;&s;embly, to procure the Concurrence of that Hou&s;e, with the Council, in the Order for burning of <HI>Zenger</HI>'s Papers; even before they were legally Condemned; and Addre&s;&s;ing the Governour to i&s;&s;ue a Proclamation, with Promi&s;e of Reward for the Di&s;covery of the Writers of them; and in an Order for Pro&s;ecuting the poor Printer. We wi&s;h we had no Occa&s;ion to repeat the&s;e Things, to &s;hew the Motives of our Conduct; had we not been obliged thereto, In Order to vindicate our &s;elves we had much rather that they had been buri|ed
<PB N="12" REF="003864_0012_100265BC068A7428">
in Silence: But under the&s;e many Forewarnings, what could we, what ought we to do for our Client? Surely every Thing that was lawfull and like|ly to contribute to his Safety. And in taking the Exception, we conceived &s;ome Benefit would accrue: For, had the Exception been allowed, the Depen|dence of the Judges on the Governour (which we thought dangerous to our Client) would be in &s;ome Mea&s;ure removed, and the Judges have &s;tood more indifferent between the real Parties; Had it been over-ruled, yet we had Rea&s;on to think, that it might have proved &s;ome Check to an exorbitant Stretch of Power; becau&s;e, That if in the <HI>dernier RESORT,</HI> the Commi&s;&s;ions had been judged illegal, any Abu&s;e offered, after Exception taken, might have rendered the Judges, not only civilly, but criminally, an&s;werable for their Conduct.</P>
<P>&para; 26. Thus either Way, &s;ome Advantage was expected, which would have been entirely lo&s;t, if the Validity of the Commi&s;&s;ions had been admitted, by pleading to the Merits of the Cau&s;e, without taking the Exception. Hence, with a &s;incere Regard to the Safety of the Poor Man, who&s;e Cau&s;e we had undertaken, we advi&s;ed, and &s;igned, and filed the Exceptions. And had we done otherwi&s;e, our Con&s;ciences mu&s;t have reproached us, with a Breach of Tru&s;t, and Neglect of Duty: Yet neither the Lawfullne&s;s of the Action, nor the Uprightne&s;s of our Intention, could &s;creen us from the Re|&s;entment of the&s;e Gentlemen. We might have been innocently mi&s;taken, in &s;uppo&s;ing an Exception would lye, when it would not, or for Cau&s;es not &s;uf|ficient; and by Law &s;hould have de&s;erved no Cen&s;ure for offering them. The Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Judges in &s;uch Ca&s;e would have only been, to have over-ruled our Exceptions, and &s;aved us the Benefit of them, in the la&s;t Re&s;ort, if we had thought they would have been of Service to us. But in this Ca&s;e, whe|ther the Exceptions were valid or not, was no Ways determined. The Of|fence was in <HI>offering any Exception at all,</HI> and it is for this only that we are Sufferers. The hone&s;t Defence of Our Client in that Point, was Crime enough with the&s;e Judges, to merit what's next to a Capital Puni&s;hment. A re&s;pectful Propo&s;al of a Matter of Law to their Judgment, that had a Tendency to bri|dle lawle&s;s Power, was by the&s;e Gentlemen treated, as Cau&s;e &s;ufficient, to de|prive us at once of the Fruits of many Years hard and laborious Study, to di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;s us of an exten&s;ive and profitable Practice.</P>
<P>&para; 27. It was then full <HI>two and Thirty</HI> Years, &s;ince one of us had fir&s;t applied to the Study of the Law (a Time near equal to the whole Age of either of the&s;e Judges) and who for &s;everal Years had been one of the olde&s;t Practitioners at the Barr here; the other of us did not want <HI>two</HI> Months of <HI>Ten</HI> Years &s;tanding there, and had had a good Share of Practice for &s;everal Years, before either of the&s;e Judges were known to have had any Knowledge of the Law, or pre|tended to have made it any Part of their Study. What hath been our Cha|racter and Reputation for Ability, of Integrity, in our Practice, and Morals, belongs not to us to declare: But we hope, our being employed in almo&s;t all the Cau&s;es within this Colony, of any Importance, that have depended for &s;everal Years la&s;t pa&s;t, may, as to tho&s;e Points, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, witne&s;s in our Favour. Yet no Regard to our Age, to the Experience of &s;o long Practice&punc; to our Innocency, our Integrity, or Abilities; no Concern for the Intere&s;t of our Clients, who had a Right to our A&s;&s;i&s;tance; nor the publick Admini&s;tra|tion of Ju&s;tice, which demanded our Help; no Tenderne&s;s or Compa&s;&s;ion for our Wives, our many Children, with which it hath plea&s;ed God to ble&s;s us, which as well as our &s;elves, had a Right to be provided for, by our hone&s;t In|du&s;try,

<P>&para; 28. We have not in all our Reading found, and believe the&s;e Gentlemen cannot produce, any Example of &s;uch a Conduct, from the Hi&s;tory of <HI>England,</HI> in the wor&s;t of Times. They may indeed produce Examples of Silencing Attornies, for notorious Villany, or Ignorance, in their Profe&s;&s;ion. They may po&s;&s;ibly al&s;o find &s;ome, and but few Examples of doing the like for other Grimes; as for In&s;tance, one <HI>Brown,</HI> convicted of Lybelling, was fined 1000 Marks, and &s;truck out of the Roll of Attornies: But (becau&s;e this Crime being neither Villany nor Ignorance in his Profe&s;&s;ion) the Inju&s;tice of that Part of the Sentence was taken Notice of by the Hou&s;e of Commons, and for that, among other Arbitrary Acts, as the Hindring the Publi&s;hing of a weekly News Paper, and putting People to their <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> to be bailed, without ju&s;t Cau&s;e, and di&s;countenancing the People in Petitioning the King for a Parlia|ment; They, in 1680, re&s;olved to impeach the Judges, and did impeach Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Scrogs,</HI> the mo&s;t guilty Per&s;on, and had they not been prorogued, and Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Scrogs</HI> di&s;placed, and another put in his Room, before the Hou&s;e &s;at again, they probably would have pro&s;ecuted their Impeachment again&s;t him.</P>
<P>&para; 29. <HI>America</HI> po&s;&s;ibly may furni&s;h &s;ome Examples of the Silencing of At|tornies, as, we have heard, did happen in the Ca&s;e of one Mr. <HI>Carter,</HI> in <HI>Parha|does,</HI> who was &s;ilenced by Governour <HI>Louther,</HI> a Man famous, not for his Vir|tues; and we have heard that Mr. <HI>Carter</HI> recovered &s;everal Thou&s;and Pounds Damages in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall,</HI> for that Arbitrary Act.</P>

<P>&para; 31. We believe this Province can afford no Example of &s;uch a Treatment, tho' there had been the &s;ame Occa&s;ion for it before this Time. We remember that in the Year 1725, in the Ca&s;e between the <HI>French</HI> Church and Mr. <HI>Ron,</HI>

The&s;e Judges might, with as much Ju&s;tice, have burnt all our Law Books, as to have deprived us of the U&s;e of them; and have de&s;troyed our Deeds, and taken away our Hou&s;es and our Lands, as to have taken away the Liberty of Exerci&s;ing our Employments, which were as dearly bought as any Thing we enjoy. We came not to them but by the Way of an expen&s;ive Stu|dy of &s;everal Languages, Arts and Sciences; our Abilities for them were the Purcha&s;e of many Years hard and co&s;tly Labour; we were duly admitted to our Practice, we ever u&s;ed it with Fidelity and a good Con&s;cience, and with what Acceptance, and E&s;teem of our Country, we doubt not but that a Thou&s;and Witne&s;&s;es can declare. What we had thus gotten, could not law|fully be taken from us, but for &s;ome notorious Crime, which our wor&s;t Ene|mies hitherto have not laid to our Charge. And we may venture to &s;ay, that we &s;till have, notwith&s;tanding the Act of the&s;e Ju&s;tices, as much Right to live and maintain our Families by our Callings, as any Merchant, Hu&s;bandman or Tradesman in the Country. And we have as good a Title to be relieved a|gain&s;t any Injury done to that Right, as any other Men. It would doubtle&s;s have been e&s;teemed a crying Grievance, if the&s;e Gentlemen had ordered the Warehou&s;e of any Merchant in Town to be &s;topped up, and di&s;abled him from any farther carrying on of his Trade, whereby he &s;upported and main|tained his Family; or if they had ordered the Farm and In&s;truments of Til|lage to be taken from any Hu&s;bandman in the Country, or if we &s;uppo&s;e that they had only di&s;abled him from Improving his Lands, and rai&s;ing Bread for him&s;elf and his Family; if they had block'd up the Way to a Mil|ler's Mill, or broke down his Dam, and hindred him from grinding; if they had taken away the Tools of a Carpenter, or &s;hut up a Tanner's Pits, and &s;poiled his Leather; and reduced the&s;e Men with their Wives and Children to a Nece&s;&s;ity of Peri&s;hing for Want of Sub&s;i&s;tance; and all this, not for hav|ing done any unlawful Act, but, for doing their Duty, and that which they were bound to perform by all po&s;&s;ible Obligations, both &s;acred and humane: We &s;ay, if our Judges had done all or any of the&s;e things, the Inju&s;tice of &s;uch Proceedings would have lain open to every Man's Ob&s;ervation; but no le&s;s than all this is contained in the Injury of which we complain, and much more, in that not only our &s;elves and our innocent Families are great Sufferers, but the publick Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice is greatly ob&s;tructed, and great Num|bers of Per&s;ons, who are our Clients, are much injured, either in the Reco|very or Defence of their ju&s;t Rights by this Arbitrary Proceeding, and we doubt not, but that it has appeared to a Demon&s;tration, from what has been &s;aid, that the Act of the&s;e Judges in debarring us from our Practice, meerly for having tendered an Exception to their Commi&s;&s;ions, is al&s;o, in its Nature and Tendency, de&s;tructive to the Liberties and Properties of the People of this Colony.</P>
<P>&para; 36. We are clearly of Opinion, that when Judges act uprightly and do ju&s;tly, they have a Right to all the Honour due to their Stations: But when they act otherwi&s;e, in plain Defiance of Common Law and Common Sen&s;e, 
<PB N="16" REF="003864_0016_10020659DF3DA288">
the injured have a Right to complain; and if the Injury be of a publick Na|ture, have a Right to demand the Aid of the Repre&s;entatives of a free People again&s;t them.</P>
<P>&para; 37. Perhaps the&s;e Gentlemen, who have done us this Wrong, and whom we accu&s;e of having greatly injured their Country thereby, may buoy up them&s;elves in their Wealth, their Power, their Friends, and Alliances, and may think, that under the Umbrage of the&s;e, they may do what they p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">, and not be called to any Account.</P>
<P>&para; 38. But, Mr. <HI>Chairman,</HI> no Man is too great for the Notice or above the Reach, of the Repre&s;entatives of a free People. If our General A&s;&s;embly will but exert that Authority that they have, by Law, a Right to, they may make the haughtie&s;t Sinner tremble before them; an Inquiry into the Conduct of publick Officers is properly their Bu&s;ine&s;s; and a publick Re&s;entment of their Mi&s;conduct (permit us to &s;ay it) is mo&s;t certainly their Duty.</P>
<P>&para; 39. The Parliament in <HI>England</HI> has always been thought the proper Court to animadvert on the Mi&s;conduct of the Judges.

<P>Mr. <HI>Speaker,</HI></P>
<P>The State of this poor Nation is to be deployed, that in almo&s;t all Ages, the Judges, who ought to be Pre&s;ervers of the Laws, have endeavoured to De|&s;troy them; and that to plea&s;e a Court Faction, they have by Treachery attempted to break the Bonds a&s;under of MAGNA CHARTA, the great Trea&s;ury of our Peace; it was no &s;ooner pa&s;t, but a Chief

<P>In the Time of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, an unthink|ing di&s;&s;olute Prince, there were Judges that did In|&s;inuate into the King, that the Parliament were only his Creatures and dependedon his Will, and not on the Fundamental Con&s;titutions of the Land; which treacherous Advice proved the ruin of the King, and for which all tho&s;e evil In&s;truments were brought to Ju&s;tice. In his late Maje&s;ty's Time, his Misfortunes were chiefly occa&s;ioned by the Corruptions of the <HI>Long Robe, his Judges</HI> by an Extrajudicial Opinion, gave the King Power to rai&s;e Money upon an Extraordinary Occa&s;ion with|out Parliament, and made the King Judge of &s;uch Occa&s;ions. Charity Prompts me to think, they thought this a Service to the King; but the &s;ad Con&s;equences of it may convince all Mankind, that every illegal Act weakens the Royal Intere&s;t&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 words"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters">our to introduce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Dominion in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">o&s;e Realms, is the wor&s;t of Trea&s;ons; becau&s;e while it bears the Face of Friend&s;hip to the King, and de&s;igns to be for his Service, it never fails of the contrary Effect.</P>
<P>The two great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">illars of the Government, are <HI>Parli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters"></HI> and <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">es,</HI> it is this gives us the Title of <HI>Freeborn Engli&s;hmen,</HI> for my Notion of <HI>free Eng|li&s;hmen</HI> is this, that they are ruled by Laws of their own making, and tryed by Men of the &s;ame Con|dition with them&s;elves. The two great and un|doubted Priviledges of the People, have been lately invaded by the Judges that now fit in <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter</HI>-Hall; they have e&s;pou&s;ed Proclamation again&s;t Law; they have di&s;countenanced and op|po&s;ed &s;everal legal Acts that tended to the &s;itting of this Honourable Hou&s;e; they have gra&s;ped the Legi&s;lative Power into their own Hands, as in that In&s;tance of Printing; the Parliament was con&s;i|dering that Matter, but they, in the Interim, made their private Opinion to be Law, to &s;uper&s;ede the Judgment of this Hou&s;e; they have di&s;charged Grand Juries, on purpo&s;e to quell their Pre&s;ent|ments, and &s;helter great Criminals from Ju&s;tice; and when Juries have pre&s;ented their Opinion for the &s;itting of this Parliament, they have in Di&s;|dain thrown <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> at their Feet, and told them, they would be no Me&s;&s;engers to carry &s;uch Peti|tions, and yet in a few Days after, have encoura|ged all that would &s;pit their Venom again&s;t the Government; they have &s;erved on Ignorant and Arbitrary Faction, and been the Me&s;&s;engers of Ab|horrences to the Kim.</P>

<P>What we have no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o do, is to load them with Shame, who bid Def<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nce, to the Law; they are guilty of Crimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t Nature, again&s;t the King, again&s;t their Knowledge, and again&s;t Po&s;terity.

The End of my Moti|on therefore is, That we may Addre&s;s warmly to our Prince again&s;t them; let us &s;ettle a Committee to enquire into their Crimes, and not fail of doing Ju&s;tice upon them that have perverted it, let us purge the Fountain, and the Streams will i&s;&s;ue pure.</P>
