<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>BECAUSE all Men are <HI>Sinful,</HI> there|fore they are <HI>Mortal.</HI> For as <HI>by one Man Sin entred into the World, &s;o Death hath pa&s;&s;ed upon all Men for that all have &s;inned.</HI> But, Eternal Prai&s;es be to the Ever-living God, that, <HI>As by one Man's di&s;obedience many were made Sinners, &s;o, by the Obedience of One &s;hall many be made Righteous.</HI> Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, God-Man-Mediator, is the Only One, by whom &s;inful Men can be Saved. He &s;aves, in <HI>Ju&s;tifying</HI> Per&s;ons by His <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> in Renewing and <HI>Sanctifying</HI> them by His <HI>Spirit.</HI> Prai&s;es be to His Great Name, that from time to time there are many &s;uch Triumphs of His Grace. We have ground to hope (&s;o far as we can judge) that Several lately remov'd from us by Death, were &s;uch.</P>

Particularly, that Aged Handmaid of the Lord Madam <HI>Bridget U&s;her,</HI> upon who&s;e Death the following Sermon was Preached. I ne|ver heard to the contrary, but that from her Youth up, her Life was Sober, Vertuous, Religious. Ever &s;ince I have known her (which has been many Years) &s;he has had (and I think ju&s;tly) the Character of an holy, blamele&s;s, clo&s;e Walker with God. She was firm and &s;tedfa&s;t in the Faith, even to the end. She &s;o walked, as to adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour. She was watchful, not only over her <HI>Actions,</HI> but over her <HI>Words</HI> too; far from that <HI>backbiting, reviling</HI> temper, which too &s;hamefully and commonly appears in many. She was very ready to promote and incou|rage <HI>pious &s;avoury Di&s;cour&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> a thing too much neglected by many Chri&s;tians. She was a wonderful Example of Chri&s;tian <HI>Patience</HI> under great Pains and Bodily Afflictions. She was a careful, con&s;tant, diligent <HI>At|tender on God's publick Wor&s;hip and Ordinan|ces;</HI> and would not &s;uffer &s;mall Inconveni|encies or difficulties to keep her therefrom, as too many are apt to do.</P>
<P>AS her Outward Carriage was commen|dable, courteous, religious; &s;o her great Sollicitude was (as appear'd from Di&s;cour&s;e and Conference) to <HI>be a Chri&s;tian indeed,</HI>

to have <HI>Faith Unfeigned,</HI> to have Integrity and Uprightne&s;s of Soul <HI>before God that trieth the Hearts.</HI></P>
<P>After a long and holy Life, &s;he died in the Lord, and re&s;ts from her Labours, and her Works follow her. Let us follow her, &s;o far as &s;he followed Chri&s;t. To be &s;incere|ly and practically Godly and Religious; is our indi&s;pen&s;able Duty, highe&s;t Honour, and greate&s;t Intere&s;t. Let us be mo&s;t &s;tudious and careful to lead &s;uch a Life; for we know not how &s;oon we may be call'd to an Account by our Glorious Judge, who can't be deceiv'd and wont be mock'd.</P>
<P>That the Sermon publi&s;hed herewith, by my dear and worthy <HI>Colleague</HI> and Fel|low-Labourer in the Work of the Go&s;pel; may be In&s;trumental of quickening Per&s;ons to an holy Life, which is the be&s;t Prepara|tion for Death; is the Prayer of him, who writes this &s;hort Preface,</P>

<HEAD>The Character of Anna, the Prophete&s;s, Con&s;ider'd and Apply'd.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>LUKE II. 37.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>She was a Widow of about Four&s;core</HI> &amp; <HI>four Years, which departed not from the Temple&mdash;.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THEY are &s;ome of the excellent Proverbs of wi&s;e <HI>Solomon,</HI>&mdash;That, <HI>The Memory of the Ju&s;t is ble&s;&s;ed:</HI> That, <HI>A Woman which feareth the Lord, &s;he &s;hall be prai&s;ed:</HI>&mdash;And that, <HI>The hoary Head is a Crown of Glory, being found in the way of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>THAT is the ju&s;t Character of all <HI>Saints,</HI> which we find given of &s;ome Women, (Act. 1350.) <HI>Devout</HI> and <HI>Honourable.</HI> And none <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|norable than the <HI>Aged</HI> Saints, the Old Di&s;ci|ples. The&s;e &s;acred Pieces of Antiquity are truly beautiful and glorious: they &s;hould be venerable in our eyes, and ought to have a double Reverence paid them. Great is the re&s;pect, which GOD has put on his aged Saints. Special Honours have been done them many times in Providence, both living and
<PB N="2" REF="002431_0008_0FDB42FE85639BB0">
dying: and the Regards &s;hown them in holy Scripture, are not &s;mall no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> common.</P>
<P>THE ancient <HI>Women</HI> as well as Men, have had &s;ingular Honours do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e them. The&s;e Mo|thers in I&s;rael have always been much e&s;teem'd and reverenc'd in the Church: Many of them have their Names recorded&punc; and their virtuous Lives celebrated in Scripture &s;tory: and in Divine Providence many times &s;ignal Favours and Dignities have been confer'd upon them.</P>
<P>TO pa&s;s over other Things, that might be mention'd,&mdash;I &s;hall only cite two famous In|&s;tances. We may ju&s;tly e&s;teem it a &s;uperior Glory to the female Sex, That <HI>GOD &s;ent forth his Son, made of a Woman,</HI> and this by a mira|culous Conception: by which means He has in a great mea&s;ure wiped off the Reproach, that was fallen upon that Sex, upon account of the Woman's being fir&s;t in the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT another thing, whereby this Sex hath been not a little dignify'd, is the extraordinary Honour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> upon godly <HI>Anna,</HI> in her being imploy'd (together with devout <HI>Simeon</HI>) to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> publick Te&s;timony to the holy Child <HI>Je&s;us:</HI> An account of which we have before us, in the Chapter containing our Text.</P>
<P>OUR Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t being made under the Law, humbled him&s;elf to attend &amp; ob&s;erve all the In&s;titutions and Ceremonies of it. He was circumcis'd, on the day and in the manner appointed. Afterwards at the time pre&s;cribed, when he was about Six Weeks old, His Parents brought Him to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> (being a Fir&s;t-born
<PB N="3" REF="002431_0009_0FDB43008E25F2C0">
Son) to pre&s;ent Him to the Lord, and offer a Sacrifice, according to the cu&s;tom of the Law.</P>
<P>NOW, at the time when the Child <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was pre&s;ented in the Temple, there came thi|ther (by the direction of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI>) a cer|tain Jew, named <HI>Simeon,</HI> a ju&s;t and devout and (probably) an aged Man, waiting for the Con|&s;olation of I&s;rael: who, &s;eeing the Child, the Lord's Chri&s;t, (as it had been revealed to him, He &s;hould do before his Death) He took him up into his venerable Arms, with the greater Affection &amp; Joy, with loud Thank&s;giving and Prai&s;e, and with publick Declarations and Pre|dictions, upon the &s;olemn and glad Occa&s;ion. [See, Ver. 25, &amp;c.]</P>
<P>AND then (that one of each Sex might bear <Q>witne&s;s to Him, in whom both Men &amp; Women are invited to believe, that they may be &s;aved</Q>) there came in al&s;o at that happy juncture a godly aged <HI>Woman,</HI> to help make up a harmony of Confe&s;&s;ions, and joyn with <HI>Simeon</HI> in a Te&s;timony to the holy Je&s;us:&mdash;which was not only a Reputation to the Child, and a Comfort to his Parents, but al&s;o an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|nour to that venerable Matron. A high Pri|vilege and Favour 'twas &s;he partook of! And 'tis a double Honour put upon her, that Record was made of this; &s;o that where&s;oever the Bible comes in the whole World, there is this told for a Memorial of her.&mdash;But 'tis &s;till a greater piece of Re&s;pect done her, that in the account thereof, we have not only her <HI>Name</HI> mention'd, but a very honorable <HI>Character</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="002431_0010_0FDB4301F9BCC300">
given of her; and this rather more large and particular than that given of <HI>Simeon,</HI> though an eminent Man in Jeru&s;alem, 'tis &s;uppos'd.</P>
<P>HER <HI>Name</HI> is called <HI>Anna;</HI> which in Hebrew is Hannah, and in Engli&s;h is often abbreviated into Ann. It &s;ignifies <HI>Gracious,</HI> or <HI>Gratify'd,</HI> An&s;wered, Comforted. The Woman in our Text, according to her Name, was both graci|ous and gratify'd. She was &s;trong in the Grace of the Lord. Great Grace was upon her. She was highly favoured, and &s;weetly comforted, when &s;he &s;aw the Holy Je&s;us pre&s;ented in the Temple.</P>
<P>Further, WE have her <HI>Parentage</HI> mentioned. She was the Daughter of <HI>Phanuel:</HI> A Man of Note, we may &s;uppo&s;e; or, his Name &s;ignifying <HI>The Face of God,</HI> it might be bro't in to remind us of <HI>Jacob'</HI>s Penuel or Phanuel<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Gen. 32. 30.</NOTE>; that now (as one ob&s;erves) the my&s;tery of that &s;hould be unfolded, when in Chri&s;t we &s;hould, as 'twere, &s;ee God face to face, and our Lives be pre|&s;erved.</P>
<P>Again, WE are told the <HI>Tribe</HI> &s;he belong'd to which was that of <HI>A&s;her;</HI> one of the Ten <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, that revolted (under the Conduct of Jeroboam) from the Hou&s;e of <HI>David,</HI> and from the true Wor&s;hip or God, and that were after|wards carried into the A&s;&s;yrian Captivity. But tho' the Generality were in the defection, yet many particular Per&s;ons continu'd in their Alle|giance to <HI>David'</HI>s Family, united them&s;elves to <HI>Judah,</HI> and remov'd their Habitations thither,
<PB N="5" REF="002431_0011_0FDB43061D7EDF70">
to expre&s;s their Zeal for the true Line of Succe&s;&s;ion, and to enjoy the true Religion, the pure Wor&s;hip of God. The pious Woman in our Text, was (probably) the remote O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">spring of one that did do &s;o, according to that anci|ent Prophecy, Jer. 50. 4. <HI>In tho&s;e days&mdash;the Chil|dren of I&s;rael &s;hall come</HI> [to Jeru&s;alem] <HI>they and the Children of Judah together, going &amp; weeping,&mdash;to &s;eek the Lord their God.</HI></P>
<P>Further, WE have her <HI>Age,</HI> and her <HI>Circum|&s;tances</HI> de&s;cribed. She is &s;aid to be a <HI>Widow,</HI> and &s;he had <HI>long</HI> been &s;o. She liv'd in a mar|ry'd State but about &s;even years; and that it &s;eems was in her Youth. 'Tis &s;aid, <HI>She lived with an Husband &s;even years from her Virginity;</HI> which denotes her tender Age as well as un|defiled Cha&s;tity. Her Husband dying, and leaving her a young Widow, &s;he &s;pent all the Remain of her Life in a &s;olitary State, never marrying again; which the &s;acred Hi&s;torian &s;eems to take notice of to her Commendation. For, in &s;ome Ca&s;es, this may be a wi&s;e part, and very prai&s;e worthy. (See the Apo&s;tle's Judgment, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 8, &amp; 40.) Yet there are other Ca&s;es, wherein 'tis advi&s;eable to marry again. (See 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5. 14. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 9.) What <HI>Anna'</HI>s Ca&s;e was, and what the Mo|tives or Rea&s;ons of her abiding in a &s;ingle State, it doth not appear. But &s;o it was, and it &s;eems to be commended in her, that &s;he con|tinued a Widow to her dying Day.&mdash;And &s;he lived to very <HI>advanced</HI> Years. Tis &s;aid, &s;he was of <HI>a great Age:</HI> She was a Widow of a|bout <HI>four&s;core and four Years.</HI> Some take it, &s;he
<PB N="6" REF="002431_0012_0FDB4307390C3B98">
liv'd &s;o long a Widow, which mu&s;t make her to be upwards of an hundred. But others reckon it from her Birth, and call it the mea&s;ure of her Life, not the duration of her Widowhood. Which &s;eems rather the more probable: For it is unlikely that a Woman &s;o very old, &s;hould be capable of fa&s;ting and praying at that rate as &s;he is &s;aid to have done. And &s;uppo&s;ing her to be but Eighty four Years old, this were a great Age; what but very few attain to; and which &s;eldom permits any ex|traordinary Fa&s;tings and Devotions; &s;uch as we may think that godly Woman was emi|nent for.</P>
<P>BUT again, in the De&s;cription of Her, we may ob&s;erve, She is &s;tyled a <HI>Prophete&s;s.</HI> By which &s;ome think is meant, &s;he had the Spirit of Prophecy, and was in&s;pired to foretell future <HI>Events.</HI> But this Title is very ambiguous, and often u&s;ed in a different Sen&s;e in both Te&s;taments. <HI>Deborah</HI> that judged I&s;rael, is call'd a <HI>Prophe|te&s;s:</HI> Which, for ought appears, only be&s;peaks her to be a Woman of eminent Holine&s;s and Prudence, and Knowledge in the Law, whereby &s;he was &s;ingularly qualified for judging of the People, though not endowed with any mi|raculous Gifts and Graces<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pool'</HI>s Annota. on Judg. 4. 4.</NOTE>. And perhaps nothing of extraordinary In&s;piration is intend|ed when the Word is applied to <HI>Anna.</HI> It may only mean that &s;he was a Mother in I&s;ra|el; a wi&s;e Woman, knowing in the Scriptures,
<PB N="7" REF="002431_0013_0FDB430B99E38870">
and di&s;pen&s;ing her In&s;tructions, Coun&s;els and Ble&s;&s;ings to all about her, as a Mother to her Children, or a Prophete&s;s to the People. It was perhaps her &s;pecial Employment to teach Children, and &s;he might make it her bu&s;ine&s;s to in&s;truct the younger Women, which the Apo&s;tle makes a &s;pecial Duty of aged Matrons. (Tit. 2. 3.) She was <HI>a Teacher of good Things:</HI> Not a public Preacher, but a private In&s;tructor; full of godly Di&s;cour&s;e at all times, and (which is the lea&s;t that can be meant) applying her &s;elf to in&s;truct tho&s;e about her. Like another <HI>Bath&s;heba,</HI> of whom ('tis thought by many) her Son <HI>Solomon</HI> de&s;igns tho&s;e words as part of her excellent Character, Prov. 31. 26, 29. <HI>She open|eth her mouth with Wi&s;dom, and in her tongue is the law of Kindne&s;s.&mdash;Many Daughters have done vertuou&s;ly, but thou excellest them all.</HI>&mdash;Anna might be call'd a Prophete&s;s on the account of her pious Di&s;cour&s;e, whereby her lips fed many. For godly Coun&s;els &amp; Exhortations are oft-times (as well as Predictions) called <HI>Prophecies.</HI> Prov. 31. 1. <HI>The words of King Lemuel, the Prophecy that his mother taught him.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore, Another Excellency of this Woman celebrated in our Text, is her uncommon <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Devotion.</HI> 'Tis &s;aid, <HI>She departed not from the Temple, but &s;erved God with Fa&s;tings and Prayers night and day.</HI></P>
<P>'TIS the <HI>Fear of God</HI> that crowns &amp; completes the Character of the virtuous Woman. No doubt, <HI>Anna</HI> was in her general behaviour as becometh Holine&s;s,&mdash;&s;ober, grave and tempe|rate in all things, ju&s;t and hone&s;t, true and
<PB N="8" REF="002431_0014_0FDB430D44712560">
faithful, charitable and peaceable, and &s;at an Example of moral Virtue in all the In&s;tances of it. But 'tis only her <HI>Piety</HI> towards God, that is expre&s;sly mentioned&punc; all the re&s;t being of little account without this, and being ne|ce&s;&s;arily comprehended in it.</P>
<P>'TIS &s;aid of Her, <HI>She departed not from the Temple:</HI> which implies at lea&s;t her con&s;tant attending on the public Wor&s;hip of God. The Generality of Expo&s;itors think it means no more. Not that &s;he had her <HI>Habitation</HI> in the Temple, but only gave her <HI>Attendence</HI> there con&s;tantly at the times of Divine Service. Thus the Prie&s;ts were bid, (Lev. 10. 7) <HI>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t to go out of the door of the Tabernacle;</HI> that is, during the appointed time of their holy Mini&s;trations. So 'tis &s;aid of the Di&s;ciples, Luk. 24. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. <HI>They were continually in the Temple, prai&s;ing &amp; ble&s;&s;ing God:</HI> that is frequently, and always at Tem|ple-hours of Wor&s;hip; as the Sacrifice offer'd Morning and Evening is call'd the <HI>continual</HI> Burnt offering. It may be explain'd by, <HI>Act.</HI> 5. 42. where it is &s;aid, <HI>DAILY in the Temple, and in every Hou&s;e, they cea&s;ed not to teach &amp; preach Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI>&mdash;Even &s;o <HI>Anna</HI> kept clo&s;e to the Public Wor&s;hip, was daily in the Temple at the hours of Prayer, Morning and Evening.&mdash;It is &s;aid, <HI>She departed not from the Temple, with Fa&s;tings and Prayers wor&s;hipping night and day</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>See the Original.</HI></NOTE>. Some think 'tis <HI>Public Wor&s;hip</HI> is &s;till &s;poken of. She &s;trictly ob&s;erv'd the <HI>Weekly Fa&s;ts</HI> of the Church, as well as attended the daily Prayers.

She laboured always fervently in Prayers.

<P>THUS, this devout Widow liv'd a Life of Prayer; and to help her Devotion, &s;he was much in <HI>Fa&s;ting.</HI> She led a Life of Mortifica|tion, us'd her &s;elf to all proper acts of Di&s;ci|pline and Self-denial, and often employ'd tho&s;e hours in Fa&s;tings and Prayers, which others generally wa&s;te in &s;leeping and feeding and diverting them&s;elves.&mdash;We may well then conclude Her to be an <HI>uncommon Saint,</HI> one of high Attainments in Grace and Knowlege.

as in general exemplary for their Virtue, for their Religion, their Knowlege in Divine Things, their edifying Conver&s;ation, their great Freedom from the too common Vices of Speech, and the like: So more particularly remarkable for their mo&s;t diligent and reverent Attendence at the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> and <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord. They were Patterns of Con&s;tancy to the Publick Wor&s;hip, and a readine&s;s to hear the Word, in &s;ea&s;on, and out of &s;ea&s;on, upon the Lord's Day, and all other Occa&s;ions: and (which was pretty &s;ingular in them) they practiced (even to the la&s;t) the good old Way of <HI>writing</HI> after the Mini&s;ter.

<P>BUT 'tis Time now to come to the <HI>Ob&s;ervations,</HI> that I particularly intended to di&s;cour&s;e upon, from the Text. We may take occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve&mdash;</P>
<P>I. PUBLIC <HI>Wor&s;hip is part of that Homage we owe to GOD, and what has been the u&s;ual Practice of His People in all Ages.</HI></P>
<P>BY the <HI>Temple</HI> in our Text, is meant the Place of God's &s;olemn and public Wor&s;hip, in Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>IN that Age and in every Generation, the People of God have had their &s;tated <HI>A&s;&s;emblies</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="002431_0021_0FDB431CF930A3E8">
for religious Wor&s;hip: And they have general|ly had &s;ome public and &s;ettled Places of Con|vention.&mdash;In the beginning of times, even in <HI>Abel'</HI>s days, we read of open and &s;ocial Wor|&s;hip. The <HI>Patriarchs,</HI> in one age and another, we find erecting Altars for this Purpo&s;e. The <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> in the Wilderne&s;s and in Canaan, had their Tabernacle (called, the Tabernacle of the Congregation) for the name of the Lord. In <HI>Solomon'</HI>s days, and afterwards, they had their <HI>Temple</HI> at Jeru&s;alem, and <HI>Synagogues</HI> through all the Land.&mdash;And in the times of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> Chri&s;tians have ever had their A&s;&s;emblies for public Wor&s;hip; and have ge|nerally had their appointed Places or Meeting|hou&s;es for it.</P>
<P>YEA, the very <HI>Heathens</HI> have been wont al|ways to pay &s;ome public Homage to their Deities.</P>
<P>INDEED, I think, the wor&s;hipping God publickly is to be refer'd to the head of <HI>natu|ral</HI> Religion, in the fir&s;t place. Though there be po&s;itive Appointment of Go&s;pel Churches for the maintaining and carrying on the pub|lic Wor&s;hip of God; yet this public Homage is founded in natural Rea&s;ons principally, at lea&s;t is &s;upported by them. There are <HI>&s;pecial</HI> Ordinances admini&s;tred in Church-Societies, which are purely grounded on the In&s;titution of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is ab&s;olute Head of the Church, and to whom &s;upremely be|longs the Regulation of the Hou&s;e of God: But public Wor&s;hip in the <HI>general,</HI> is a Dic|tate of <HI>Nature.</HI> Natural Light tells us, that
<PB N="16" REF="002431_0022_0FDB4321A2E833F8">
as we are God's Creatures, and made for His Service, we do (by con&s;equence) owe Wor|&s;hip to Him: And al&s;o that &s;eeing we are for|med for Society, we ought (as we have op|portunity) to wor&s;hip God in a &s;ocial Way.&mdash;God is the Author, Benefactor, Lord and Judge of Communities, as well as of particu|lar Per&s;ons: Therefore wor&s;hip in Societies is due to God.&mdash;Further, The Intere&s;t we have in each others <HI>Welfare</HI> as Members of the &s;ame Body, (and which we are jointly to pray for, and give Thanks for, and endeavour the Pro|motion of) does afford another and good Ar|gument. The Law of Nature does oblige Men to combine and convene in eccle&s;ia&s;tical Socie|ties and A&s;&s;emblies, for mutual Edification, as well as to unite in civil Communities for mu|tual Security, Strength and Order.</P>
<P>BUT I wou'd not enlarge here. Some fur|ther Hints may be given under the next Ob|&s;ervation: Which is,&mdash;</P>
<P>II. <HI>GOD's Public Wor&s;hip ought to be</HI> con&s;tant|ly and diligently <HI>attended.</HI></P>
<P>WE &s;hould be ambitious of <HI>Anna'</HI>s excellent Character, of whom 'tis &s;aid, <HI>She departed not from the Temple night nor day.</HI> We &s;hould love the Hou&s;e of God, the place where His Honour dwells. We &s;hould de&s;ire to dwell there al|ways; take all Opportunities to come into God's Sanctuary, and con&s;tantly wait upon him there in all the Ways of His appointment.</P>
<P>HERE I &s;hall only con&s;ider the <HI> Rea&s;ons of the Doctrine,</HI> or &s;how the Obligations lying on Chri&s;tians to be con&s;tant and diligent in their
<PB N="17" REF="002431_0023_0FDB4322F6FCE780">
attending on the public Wor&s;hip. They are various and numerous: But I &s;hall endeavour to reduce them all under the following Heads. Now then, con&s;ider&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>GOD</HI> requires <HI>this of us in His Word.</HI></P>
<P>THE revealed Will of God is the Rule of Man's Duty. That then mu&s;t be of the greate&s;t Weight with us in every ca&s;e; and what&s;oe|ver that pre&s;cribes to us, we mu&s;t attend and ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>NOW it's evident, that God in His Word requires us to frequent his Hou&s;e, and wait on Him in public Wor&s;hip diligently. It is plain, God required this of the <HI>Jews.</HI> And 'tis as plainly demanded of Chri&s;tians. That Pro|phecy which looks forward to Go&s;pel times, is a declaration of God's preceptive Will, and Expectations concerning us: I&s;ai. 2. 3. <HI>Many people &s;hall &s;ay, Come ye and let us go up to the hou&s;e of the God of Jacob; and he will teach <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of his ways, and we will walk in his paths.</HI></P>
<P>WE have an <HI>Apo&s;tolic Canon</HI> expre&s;ly forbid|ding and rebuking <HI>Negligence</HI> in this Matter. Heb. 10. 25. <HI>For&s;ake not the a&s;&s;embling your&s;elves together as the manner of &s;ome is.</HI> This Prohi|bition of Negligence implies a Demand of Di|ligence and Con&s;tancy in attending upon God's Wor&s;hip. It directs Chri&s;tians to <HI>keep up</HI> pub|lick A&s;&s;emblies for religious Purpo&s;es, and requires all to frequent them.&mdash;That ancient Command is not yet out of Date. Lev. 19 30. <HI>Ye &s;hall keep my Sabbaths and reverence my Sanc|tuary: I am the Lord.</HI> We mu&s;t &s;hew a due Re&s;pect and Reverence to the Hou&s;e of God;
<PB N="18" REF="002431_0024_0FDB43248515F4C8">
and in taken hereof, it is our duty con&s;tantly to frequent it. The Reverence required is to be under&s;tood in Oppo&s;ition <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> contemp|tuous <HI>Neglect,</HI> as well as carele&s;s Attendence. We implicitly <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Church of God,</HI> by needle&s;s Ab&s;ence from it; as well as by pro|fane Behaviour in it. Eccl. 5. 1. <HI>Keep thy Foot when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t to the Hou&s;e of God, and be&mdash;ready to hear</HI>&mdash;the Word read and preach|ed there every Sabbath.</P>
<P>BUT <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">arther, <HI>The weekly Revolution of the Lord's Day</HI> calls for our frequent attending on his Public Wor&s;hip. God has in&s;tituted a ho|ly Sabbath, which returns once every Week, and is to be &s;olemnized partly, yea principal|ly, by Public Wor&s;hip. The Sabbath is not to be devoted to meer Idlene&s;s; nor to be em|ployed in private Duties only, but in public Exerci&s;es al&s;o.&mdash;One End of the Sabbath is to acknowledge God as the common Creator and Benefactor of Mankind. And this End is be&s;t attained by a publick Appearance and joint Wor&s;hip. Now to accommodate this, one certain Day is appointed to be the Sabbath. And this divine appointment does very evidently be&s;peak the Sabbath to be de&s;ign|ed peculiarly for public Wor&s;hip. For, what need is there of a public Day for private Wor|&s;hip? Every Man might have cho&s;en his own Time for this, and &s;uited the Day to his own Affairs. But God hath &s;een meet to fix the Sabbath on one particular Day and common Sea&s;on: And why has He done &s;o, but that we might a&s;&s;emble together; and might know
<PB N="19" REF="002431_0025_0FDB432889CC83B0">
<HI>when</HI> to a&s;&s;emble our&s;elves, without the con|&s;tant Trouble of agreeing upon the Time?&mdash;This Sabbath (as I &s;aid) returns every week. The Seventh part of our Time is devoted to it, by the Fourth Commandment: which al&s;o obliges <HI>all</HI> to keep the Sabbath, and to ob&s;erve it carefully. <HI>Remember</HI> the Sabbath to keep it holy. We mu&s;t no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> forget the Sabbath at any time, nor wilfully neglect any of the Duties of it.&mdash;By virtue of this Precept therefore, we are bound to give our con&s;tant Attendence on the public Wor&s;hip, one day every Week. <HI>Thus often</HI> at lea&s;t there mu&s;t be a holy Convocation. <HI>Thus often</HI> we are, with|out Fail, to wor&s;hip God publickly, if we can.</P>
<P>MOREOVER we may ob&s;erve, <HI>The Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t has in&s;tituted particular Churches,</HI> which are Societies for Wor&s;hip, united and agreeing to walk together in the Faith and Order of the Go&s;pel. Now the Nature, Ends, and Occa&s;ions of the&s;e Societies call for their frequent Convention. There are Duties and Ordinances of a public Nature, to be ob&s;erv'd by Chri&s;tians; which can't be attended by us in our own Clo&s;ets or Families, but require a general Meeting of the &s;everal Members of the religious Body. And the&s;e Things we are call'd upon to attend with Frequency.</P>
<P>THUS, <HI>Prayer</HI> is one Part of public Wor&s;hip, and a Church-Duty<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Tim. 2. 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> Hence God's Hou&s;e is called an <HI>Hou&s;e of Prayer,</HI> I&s;ai. 5. 7.

<P>AGAIN, <HI>Singing of P&s;alms</HI> and <HI>Prai&s;ing</HI> of God, is another public Du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y; and what we are bid to be frequent in.

<P>AGAIN, <HI>Preaching the Word</HI> is a public Ordinance. It &s;uppo&s;es the pre&s;ence of &s;ome to hear, and requires a Convention of the Flock to be fed with Mini&s;terial In&s;tructions. Now this Work is to be diligently attended by Go&s;|pel-Mini&s;ters. 2 Tim. 4. 1, 2. <HI>I charge thee before God&mdash;, Preach the Word, be instant in &s;ea|&s;on, out of &s;ea&s;on,</HI> &amp;c. So 1 Tim. 4. 13. <HI>Give attendence to Reading, to Exhortation, to Doctrine.</HI> And if Mini&s;ters mu&s;t be diligent in preaching, the People &s;hould be diligent in attending.</P>
<P>YEA, Chri&s;tians are expre&s;ly <HI>requir'd</HI> to be diligent Hearers of the Word. Jam. 1. 19, 20. <HI>My beloved Brethren, let every man be &s;wift to hear;&mdash;and receive with meekne&s;s the Ingra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed word, which is able to &s;ave your &s;ouls.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN, The <HI>Sacraments</HI> of Bapti&s;m and the Lord's Supper are public Ordinances. <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> is &s;o. Tho' in &s;ome extraordinary ca&s;es it has
<PB N="21" REF="002431_0027_0FDB432B39CA9228">
been and may be admini&s;tred not in a public Congregation: yet (I pre&s;ume) 'tis expedient that it &s;hould ordinarily be di&s;pen&s;ed in Pub|lick, in the Face of the Church. The Nature, Ends, and U&s;es of Bapti&s;m &s;peak it proper and requi&s;ite that it &s;hould be openly admini&s;tred and receiv'd. Now the Calls and Occa&s;ions for this Ordinance are frequent: and therefore religious A&s;&s;emblies for the Admini&s;tration of this (among other Ordinances) &s;hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d be fre|quent.&mdash;Again, The <HI>Lord's Supper</HI> is a pub|lic Ordinance. Chri&s;tians mu&s;t <HI>come together in the Church, into one place,</HI> when they would eat the Lord's Supper. (1 Cor. 11. 18, 20.) It is a common Fea&s;t, and one In&s;trument of the Communion of Saints, with one another as well as with Chri&s;t. 1 Cor. 10. 16, 17. <HI>The Bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the Body of Chri&s;t? For, we being many, are one Bread and one Body; for we are all partakers of that one Bread,</HI> or Loaf; the vi&s;ible &s;ign of Chri&s;t's Body, and emblem of the Union and Fraternity of His People. Now this Ordinance is of &s;tanding Obligation, and to be <HI>frequently</HI> cele|brated in the Church of Chri&s;t. 1 Cor. 5. 8. <HI>Let us keep the Fea&s;t.</HI> 1 Cor. 11. 26, 28. <HI>As often as ye eat this bread and drink this Cup, &s;hew ye the Lord's Death <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ill he come. Let a man examine him&s;elf, and &s;o let him eat.</HI> This Ordinance is to continue in the Church 'till Chri&s;t's &s;econd and per&s;onal Coming at the day of Judgment. 'Till then it mu&s;t be kept up and ob&s;erv'd in the Chri&s;tian World. And every real Chri&s;tian ought to attend upon it diligently.&mdash;It &s;hould

<P>THESE and many other Promi&s;es there be to &s;uch as are con&s;ciencious Sabbatizers, and therefore &s;trict to the public Wor&s;hip.

<P N="4">4. <HI>I might draw another Argument from the con&s;tant</HI> Inclination <HI>and Tendency of the</HI> New Nature <HI>in real Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>THE Fruit of the Spirit is <HI>Love:</HI> Love to God, to his Name, Wor&s;hip, and Service; Love to his Day, to his Mini&s;ters and People: A Delight in the Communion of Saints; A Zeal for the public Good; Re&s;entment of public Evils, &amp;c. All which gracious Di&s;po&s;i|tions have a tendency to bring us to the Hou&s;e of God frequently: and they are all to be put into the <HI>Character</HI> of a devout Soul. <HI>David</HI> &s;peaks the common Language of real Saints, when he &s;ays, <HI>How amiable are thy Taberna|cles, O Lord of Ho&s;ts!

<P>THESE are the Di&s;po&s;itions of a renewed Soul; and they are the fruits of the Spirit. The&s;e divine Principles and Pa&s;&s;ions are in|&s;pir'd from above. And they are not implant|ed <HI>in vain:</HI> but mu&s;t be improv'd and pur&s;u'd into agreeable practice. This is the Temper

<P>WE may hence then very well form an Argument for public Wor&s;hip, and &s;trongly infer our Obligations to a diligent Attendence on it, as we would approve our &s;elves the true Children of God, and not forfeit the Character of Chri&s;t's Di&s;ciples.</P>

<P N="5">5. <HI>OUR Duty is enforced and recommended by many worthy and warranted</HI> Patterns <HI>of it.</HI></P>
<P>WE have the be&s;t Examples (worthy of all Imit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ion and Regard) to quicken, direct and encourage us in this matter. I &s;hall only in|&s;tance in the Example of Chri&s;t and His pri|mitive Di&s;ciples.</P>
<P>WHAT more engaging Con&s;ideration is there than the Example of our <HI>ble&s;&s;ed Lord?</HI> Who&s;e practice it was, in the days of His Fle&s;h&punc; to appear at the public Wor&s;hip in &s;ea&s;on and out of &s;ea&s;on, &s;ometimes hearing and &s;ometimes teaching, in the Tem|ple and in the Synagogues&punc; and herein <HI>He has le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t us an Example, that we &s;hould follow his Steps, and walk as he al&s;o walked.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> and <HI>primitive Christians</HI> were zealous Imitators of Chri&s;t in this: Of whom we read, Luke 24. 53. <HI>They were continually in the Temple, prai&s;ing and ble&s;&s;ing God.</HI> So Act. 2. 42. <HI>They continued &s;tedfa&s;tly</HI> in the Apo&s;|tles Doctrine and Fellow&s;hip, and in breaking of Bread and Prayers.

Here He graciou&s;ly (by his Word and Spirit) convinces and converts them, opens their eyes, and turns them from darkne&s;s to light; from the power of Satan unto God: cau&s;es them to behold wondrous Things out of his Law and Go&s;pel: brings them to a fight of their Sin and Mi&s;ery by Nature, and of their Remedy by Chri&s;t&punc; to a &s;en&s;e of their need of Chri&s;t, and to a &s;aving clo&s;ure with him. In a Word, Here Sinners are brought to know the Things of their Peace, and to acquaint them&s;elves with God; and are begotten by his word of truth. P&s;al. 87. 5. <HI>Of Zion it &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;aid, This and that Man was born in her.</HI>&mdash;O what Ble&s;&s;ings are the&s;e: Worthy of all Acceptation! Infinitely worth all the Pains that Sinners can be at (and loudly calling upon them) to come unto the Hou&s;e of God for them.</P>
<P>BUT further, Here are many Benefits accru|ing to the <HI>Saints and Children of God.</HI> Here Believers are edify'd in Knowledge, Grace, and Comfort. We read (fore-cited Act. 9. 31.) <HI>Then had the Churches re&s;t, and were edifyed, walking in the Fear of the Lord, and in the Comfort of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> Hence tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of the P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;al. 84. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are they that dwell in thy Hou&s;e.</HI>&mdash;<HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is the man, who&s;e &s;trength is in thee:</HI>&mdash;<HI>They go from &s;trength to &s;trength;</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="002431_0041_0FDB434B93449A18">
<HI>every one of them in Zion, appeareth before God.</HI> By the Word and Ordinances of God the <HI>new Creature</HI> begotten here, is maintained, cheri&s;h|ed, and invigorated. Here all the Graces of the Divine Nature in the Saints do receive Vigour and Nouri&s;hment: and they that <HI>wait on God renew their &s;trength,</HI> &s;o that they mount up, as with Eagles Wings, and have their Conver&s;ation in Heaven.</P>
<P>THE public Wor&s;hip of God, if duly at|tended, has a <HI>natural</HI> Efficacy, to promote our Holine&s;s and Heavenly-mindedne&s;s. The very calling us out of our Hou&s;es, and taking us off from our Secular Affairs, and engaging in religious Exerci&s;es, even the&s;e Things have a tendency to wean us from the World, and make us &s;piritually minded.&mdash;Again, The Pre&s;ence of our Fellow Saints is <HI>profitable</HI> to us in the Wor&s;hip of God. This hath a natural influence to unite our hearts in brotherly Love; to di&s;po&s;e us unto a becoming Reverence and Solemnity; to awaken our at|tention, to &s;trengthen our Faith, and to inflame our Devotion. The union of many devout Souls in a joint pre&s;ence, mutually rai&s;es and enlivens their affections. As the Collection of many di&s;per&s;ed <HI>Rays</HI> into a narrow Compa&s;s, gives them a greater &s;trength and heat; or as the laying <HI>Coals</HI> of Fire together in a body, makes them burn the fiercer: Even &s;o the Concurrence of a Multitude in the Solemnities of God's Hou&s;e, tends to kindle and diffu&s;e a common Ardour in the wor&s;hipping A&s;&s;embly. The grave Faces, the &s;erious Airs, and reverent
<PB N="36" REF="002431_0042_0FDB434F13F52950">
Ge&s;tures, the &s;olemn Voices and Example of our Fellow-wor&s;hippers, all con&s;pire to warm our Hearts, and compo&s;e us to a like &s;erious frame and carriage, by a natural efficacy.</P>
<P>BUT then there is al&s;o a <HI>&s;upernatural</HI> Influ|ence and Pre&s;ence of the Holy <HI>Spirit,</HI> our &s;upreme Teacher and only Sanctifier; from whom the Saints often receive ble&s;&s;ed Di&s;cove|ries of God, and &s;pecial Communications, when waiting on him in his Hou&s;e. Here they re|ceive increa&s;e of Knowlege, and fre&s;h &s;upplies of Grace in the u&s;e of holy Ordinances: new Recruits of Strength, to fortify them again&s;t Temptations, to enable them unto Duty, &amp;c. I might ob&s;erve, 'Twas, <HI>when they were all with one accord in one place,</HI> a&s;&s;embled for the Wor|&s;hip of God, that there was &s;uch a marvellous Effu&s;ion of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> upon the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> as we read of, <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t.</HI> 2. 1.</P>
<P>FURTHER, How often in the A&s;&s;emblies of the Saints, are there the mo&s;t refre&s;hing <HI>Com|forts</HI> derived to pious Souls! Here the Lord meets his People, and &s;peaks Peace unto them. They &s;ee him in his power and glory in his Sanctuary. They &s;ometimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it under his &s;hadow <HI>with great delight,</HI> and his fruit is &s;weet unto their ta&s;te. They are abundantly &s;atisfy'd with the fatne&s;s of his Hou&s;e, and made to drink of the River of his plea&s;ures. Here he regales them with the bread of Life, and with wine of Con&s;olation.</P>
<P>HERE are tho&s;e <HI>Exerci&s;es,</HI> as well as <HI>Enter|tainments,</HI> that afford the true&s;t, the &s;weete&s;t Plea&s;ure and Satisfaction to the &s;piritually

minded. Here they &s;ing the <HI>Songs</HI> of Sion, and celebrate the Prai&s;es of their God and Saviour. Here they pour out their Souls in humble <HI>Prayer,</HI> and are permitted familiarly to unbo&s;om them&s;elves (in all their troubles) to their chief Friend and mighty Helper, the ble&s;&s;ed God. Here they preach or hear the <HI>Word</HI> of Chri&s;t, which is better to them than their nece&s;&s;ary food, &s;weeter al&s;o than honey, and rather to be cho&s;en than fine Gold. Here al&s;o they are admitted to <HI>faederal</HI> Tran&s;actions with God, which are the mo&s;t awful, and yet joyful acts of Devotion. Here they &s;it down at the <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord; where they are brought nigh by the blood of the Lamb, and behold the King in his beauty. Here they fea&s;t upon the Memorials of Chri&s;t's dying Love, have their neare&s;t and mo&s;t delightful approaches to God, and have their whole Souls &s;ometimes drawn out in ardent breathings and elevations heavenward. Their Hearts are in&s;pired with devout Fervours: and O how &s;ublime, how &s;weet, the plea&s;ures of true Devotion! We read of the primitive <HI>Chri&s;tians, They gladly received the word; and they continued daily with one accord in the Temple, being stedfa&s;t in the Apo&s;tles doctrine and fellow&s;hip, and in breaking of bread &amp; prayers; and did eat their meat with gladne&s;s and &s;inglene&s;s of heart, prai&s;ing God.</HI> How often are the Saints enlarged and carried out in Communion with God; and made joyful in his hou&s;e of Prayer, by gra|cious an&s;wers of Peace, &s;o that they cannot but &s;ay, <HI>It's good being here!</HI> Hither they
<PB N="38" REF="002431_0044_0FDB435243086DA0">
come (it may be) with their various bur|dens, their griefs, or fears, their doubts and temptations; as <HI>Hannah</HI> of old in the bitter|ne&s;s of her Soul came to <HI>Shiloh,</HI> or as <HI>A&s;aph</HI> in his darkne&s;s and perplexity went into the <HI>Sanctuary of God:</HI> And here (like them) they receive help from above, obtain light and peace many times, &s;o that they go away with their countenances no more &s;ad, and with their Mouths full of chearful Prai&s;es.</P>
<P>IN a word, Here our Lord commands the Ble&s;&s;ing, <HI>even Life for evermore.</HI> This is the Ble&s;&s;ing out of <HI>Sion,</HI> the Ble&s;&s;ing out of the <HI>hou&s;e</HI> of God. This is the Benediction pro|nounced (from the Prie&s;ts lips) upon the Congregation of the Lord: And if there be any Sons of peace among them, it comes down and re&s;ts upon the&s;e devout Souls. This Ble&s;s|ing is on the head of the Ju&s;t. In the hou&s;e of God they have Him by his witne&s;&s;ing Spi|rit, &s;aying <HI>Amen</HI> to mini&s;terial Benedictions given in his Name. Here he &s;eals them to the Day of Redemption. Here they often re|ceive ble&s;&s;ed A&s;&s;urances of their title to Hea|ven, as well as are trained up and advanced in their meetne&s;s for Heaven; being inur'd to the Employments and anticipating the En|joyments of it. So that we may &s;ay with <HI>Jacob,</HI> Verily, <HI>this is none other but the hou&s;e of God, and this is the gate of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>WE may well then conclude with the P&s;al|mi&s;t, That <HI>it is good for us to draw near to God:</HI> And truly, the nearer the better. A devout and diligent waiting upon God in his hou&s;e
<PB N="39" REF="002431_0045_0FDB43546008D9F8">
is the &s;ure way, and ordinarily nece&s;&s;ary, to our obtaining tho&s;e rich and great Ble&s;&s;ings. Thus runs the Promi&s;e <HI>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you,</HI> Jam. 4. 8. So Prov. 8. 34. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is the man that heareth me,</HI> (&s;aith Chri&s;t) <HI>watching daily at my Gates.</HI> P&s;al. 92. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e that be plan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed in the hou&s;e of the Lord, &s;hall flouri&s;h in the Courts of our God.</HI> And the more frequently, and diligently we do attend on the public Wor&s;hip, the greater Benefit we &s;hall (by a common ble&s;&s;ing) receive. The oftner we come to the hou&s;e of God, the better prepared for it we are like to be. E|very opportunity duly imployed, will &s;erve to confirm our Souls, to quicken and &s;treng|then our Graces, and improve our Comforts.</P>
<P>IN a word, Waiting on God in his Ordi|nances is the way to obtain tho&s;e &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings we need: And the more diligent and con&s;tant we are in the Application of proper means, the more likely we are to &s;e|cure the de&s;ired End.</P>
<P>NONE are got above the need of outward Helps and Means, whatever Proficiency they have already made in Knowledge and Grace.</P>
<P>THE Benefit, the Succe&s;s of Ordinances is ab&s;olutely in Chri&s;t's gift.</P>
<P>WE have ground to hope for this Ble&s;&s;ing to pro&s;per us in the regular u&s;e of the Means at one time as well as another: And at all times, his In&s;titutions as means, have a like aptitude and tendency to the ble&s;&s;ed End.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e Reflections then it appears, that we may look for a <HI>more abundant Ble&s;&s;ing</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="002431_0046_0FDB435850D7C868">
to be upon us, the more con&s;tant and diligent we are in our &s;erious attendence on the pub|lic Wor&s;hip of God.</P>
<P>NOW, what a &s;trong Incentive to our Duty is here, and what an irre&s;i&s;tible Argument is brought us? For every regular Motive affords a good Rea&s;on, and infers our ju&s;t Obligations to a Thing. When Intere&s;t and Duty meet together and unite in their Demands, there is a double Bond upon us: And I would here add; None can rationally imagine but that, what hath &s;uch an A&s;pect upon our pre&s;ent and future Well-being, and &s;o great a Tenden to our real Happine&s;s, as a clo&s;e Adherence to the public Wor&s;hip of God thus apparent|ly hath, mu&s;t needs be our very important Duty, and bound upon us by the Laws of our own Con&s;titution. For Self-love is a fundamental Principle in human Nature. Every thing has an innate and invincible <HI>Conatus</HI> or Endeavour and Propen&s;ity towards it's own Perfection and Welfare: And every regular Exerci&s;e of this natural Pa&s;&s;ion is undoubtedly our proper Duty.</P>
<P>BUT in the <HI>la&s;t</HI> place, I &s;hall only add this one Hint further, to inforce all that has been &s;aid,<ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>BY a frequent, &s;teddy and devout Atten|dence on the Wor&s;hip of God in his Hou&s;e, we &s;hall <HI>imitate</HI> and hold a <HI>corre&s;pondence</HI> with the ble&s;&s;ed Congregation of Saints in the <HI>upper</HI> world, who are <HI>continually</HI> prai&s;|ing God and &s;erving him in his temple above
<PB N="41" REF="002431_0047_0FDB4358F9E06800">
<HI>day and night,</HI> and &s;hall <HI>go no more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t.</HI> By wor&s;hipping God aright here, we begin the Employment, that a ble&s;&s;ed Eternity is to be &s;pent in. And by Temple-Wor&s;hip, in a par|ticular manner, we do re&s;emble and have Communion with the glorious Society above, where Millions perhaps at once join their melodious Songs, and pay their exalted De|votions together. By this means there's a <HI>Harmony</HI> between Heaven and Earth; yea, in &s;ome &s;ort, a <HI>Heaven</HI> upon <HI>Earth.</HI> Churches walking in the faith and order of the Go&s;pel, are &s;o many little Emblems of Heaven: and every pious Soul, when joyning in the public A&s;&s;emblies, may ju&s;tly look upon him&s;elf as tran&s;ported into the very &s;uburbs of the Hea|venly Jeru&s;alem; it being the neare&s;t Re&s;em|blance and Approach to it in this World. In the ardours of his Devotion, the pious Soul mounts up, as upon Eagles Wings, and by faith joyns with the innumerable Company of glorify'd Spirits; mingling his humble prai&s;es with their triumphant adorations, and having &s;ometimes Joy un&s;peakable and full of glory.&mdash;Altho' indeed, it is a Joy that a &s;tranger intermeddles not with, and a Glory which the carnally minded know nothing of.</P>
<P>BUT thus I have &s;omewhat largely (much more largely than I at fir&s;t intended) &s;hown our manifold Obligations and Induce|ments to be very con&s;tant and diligent in the practice of public Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="002431_0048_0FDB435B4F43A760">
<HI>AND now, to apply in &s;ome general hints, what has been &s;aid:</HI></P>
<P>HENCE much Compa&s;&s;ion is due to &s;uch pious Souls, as love and long for the Hou&s;e of God, but are deny'd the advantage of public Wor&s;hip, either wholly or frequently. <Q>Such are truly to be pity'd and pray'd for, and (as there is opportunity) vi&s;ited and comforted<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>See a Sermon, by my Rev. Father &amp; Collegu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Mr.</HI> Wad&s;worth, <HI>on P&s;al</HI> 122 1. <HI>Where you will find mo&s;t of the Heads of Application, that I only hint at, pathetically enlarg'd upon.</HI></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>AGAIN, Hence 'tis a fault and folly in Chri&s;tians (for the &s;ake of worldly Accommo|dations) to &s;ettle, and content them&s;elves in &s;uch places, where the public Wor&s;hip of God cannot be enjoy'd; where they for&s;ake God, and forget his holy Mountain.</P>
<P>AGAIN, Hence 'tis the important duty of every Place and People de&s;titute of God's pub|lic Wor&s;hip, to &s;eek after the Settlement of Go&s;pel-Ordinances among them.</P>
<P>AGAIN, Chri&s;tians &s;hould quicken and ex|hort and call upon one another (as there is occa&s;ion) to go up to the Hou&s;e of the Lord. Heads of Families &s;hould command their Hou&s;hold to keep the way of the Lord. Parents &s;hould bring their Children betimes (as &s;oon as can be convenient) with them&s;elves to the Hou&s;e of God, and &s;hould reach them an early Reverence and E&s;teem for his public Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>AGAIN, Great is the Folly and Impiety of tho&s;e, who de&s;pi&s;e or lightly e&s;teem the pub|lic Wor&s;hip, or any part of it; who count
<PB N="43" REF="002431_0049_0FDB435CB34C56E8">
the public Attendence in God's Hou&s;e a Burden, and the Sabbath a Wearine&s;s, and his Table or any of his Ordinances contemptible. Some there are who altogether ab&s;ent them&s;elves from public Wor&s;hip: others that come to it but &s;eldom; and Multitudes that attend it very carele&s;ly; or very defectively, omitting &s;ome of the main duties of it.&mdash;But how great is the folly and guilt of all &s;uch! O that they might be brought to Conviction and Re|formation; and no longer let any fooli&s;h Lu&s;ts, or carnal Rea&s;onings, or &s;mall Inconveniences, detain them from the Hou&s;e of God, or hinder them from their Duty in any In&s;tance!</P>
<P>BUT again, What has been &s;aid, &s;ugge&s;ts matter of Humiliation to us all; in that we have no more affection and zeal towards the Hou&s;e of God; that we are no more thankful for the Sanctuary-Opportunities we are &s;o happily di&s;tingui&s;hed withal above mo&s;t in the World; that we bring forth no better fruit; and that we are &s;o di&s;pos'd upon any trivial pretences many times to tarry away from the public Wor&s;hip. O what a heavy Account, have multitudes of us to give up to God, of our abu&s;ed or neglected Privileges!</P>
<P>FURTHER MORE, What has been &s;aid may &s;erve to encourage and comfort &s;uch as are careful duly to attend upon and to maintain the public Wor&s;hip of God. Surely the&s;e &s;hall receive the Ble&s;&s;ing from the Lord, and Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s from the God of their Salvation! They take the be&s;t method to &s;ecure their own Happine&s;s, as well as to promote the Glory of

God; and herein approve them&s;elves Men of Wi&s;dom and good Under&s;tanding.&mdash;And O how happy is the People, how happy the Places, that abound with Per&s;ons of &s;uch an excellent Spirit, and among whom the Hou&s;e of God flouri&s;hes, and his Children like Olive-plants &s;tand round about his Table. Happy is the People, that is in &s;uch a Ca&s;e. Surely Salva|tion is nigh to &s;uch a People, and Glory dwells in their Land. Peace will be within their Wails and Pro&s;perity in their Palaces. This they have ground to hope for, from that Pro|mi&s;e, in <HI>Jer.</HI> 17. 24, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Finally, LET what has been &s;aid, <HI>excite</HI> us all diligently and devoutly to frequent the public Wor&s;hip of God, and not depart from his holy Temple. Let us all be firmly per|&s;uaded of our Duty, and Intere&s;t, and innume|rable Obligations, in this matter.

Let none neglect public Wor&s;hip from a <HI>mi&s;taken notion</HI> as if they could perform their Devotions as acceptably, and get as much Good, at Home, as in the Church of God.

<P>IT is a Duty, incumbent on them, in common with others. However e&s;tabli&s;h'd &amp; improv'd in Grace they may be, yet they are not above the need of Ordinances: and however advanc'd in Years, they mu&s;t never think them&s;elves pa&s;t them, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it only for young Beginners. It is expected of them that have dwelt in the Hou&s;e of the Lord, that they &s;till bring forth Fruit even <HI>in old Age,</HI> (P&s;al. 92. 14.) That they continue their Attendence on public Ordinan|ces, and grow in their Fruitfulne&s;s under them.</P>
<P>MOST commonly Aged Per&s;ons have &s;ingu|lar Advantages and Accommodations to attend God's Hou&s;e with a greater frequency than others; I mean particularly, in re&s;pect of freedom from Bu&s;ine&s;s, and worldly Avocati|ons. They have ordinarily more Lei&s;ure, and fewer Impediments from the World. And hav|ing
<PB N="48" REF="002431_0054_0FDB436A33B22950">
thus &s;pecial Opportunities, it is peculiarly incumbent on them, to be living a Life of De|votion &amp; Communion with God; and therefore to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it loo&s;e from the Cares and Bu&s;ine&s;s of the World, as well as to be weaned much from the Diver&s;ions &amp; Conver&s;ation of it. Indeed Elder Per&s;ons, as well as Younger, &s;hould have &s;ome Calling or Employment, in which they ought to &s;pend part of their Time, for the &s;erving of their Generation, and not devote them&s;elves (as the manner of &s;ome is) to Sloth and Ea&s;e; which often betrays them into many fooli&s;h and hurtful Lu&s;ts. However, It is not expected of the Ancient, nor is it commonly needful, that they attend their &s;ecular Affairs with that Indu&s;try and Application, which is both law|ful and commendable in younger People. Per&s;ons in Years may be allowed more Relax|ations, and may in &s;ome ca&s;es exchange a difficult or inferiour Calling, for a more ea&s;y and honourable Employment. Neverthele&s;s, in their &s;erving of God and working out their own Salvation, it is incumbent on them and becomes them to be eminently zealous and indu&s;trious. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">igher their Life is to a Period, the more &s;hould they abound in the work of the Lord, and in the Communion of Saints. Heb. 10. 25. <HI>Not for&s;aking the a&s;&s;embling of our &s;elves together, as the manner of &s;ome is; but exhorting one another: and &s;o much the more as ye &s;ee the day approaching.</HI></P>
<P>THE Hou&s;e of God is an Emblem of <HI>Heaven,</HI> whither aged Saints are ha&s;tning to take up their everla&s;ting Abode. How amiable then
<PB N="49" REF="002431_0055_0FDB4370389A66F8">
&s;hould God's Tabernacles be to them; and his Wor&s;hip how much their Delight, how con|&s;tantly their Bu&s;ine&s;s&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> beautiful to them &s;hould be the Feet of tho&s;e, that bring the Tidings of Salvation and preach the good Word of God! How plea&s;ant his Sabbaths; and how glad ought they to be, when called upon to go up to the Hou&s;e of the Lord! There they &s;hould be waiting for the Salvation of God! And not depart from his Temple!</P>
<P>IT is expected of aged Saints, that their long <HI>Experience</HI> of the Sweetne&s;s and many Benefits of God's public Wor&s;hip do inflame their Zeal and Love to his Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>AND then who &s;hould be <HI>Examples</HI> to others&punc; if not the aged Saints? The&s;e &s;urely are in an eminent degree obliged to be exemplary. They &s;hould &s;tudy to be living Rules to their Juni|ors; bright Patterns of all Piety, and Virtue; particularly of a love to and diligent attend|ence at the hou&s;e of God. It is required of the Aged, that they be <HI>in behaviour as becometh Ho|line&s;s,</HI> and that they be <HI>Teachers of good things</HI> by pattern as well as precept. (Tit. 2. 3.) A &s;teddy and zealous Attendence upon the public Wor&s;hip and Ordinances of God's hou&s;e, is one in&s;tance of good Behaviour becoming Holine&s;s, in aged Saints e&s;pecially; and is one of tho&s;e good things, which they are requir'd to teach the Younger, and lead them into by their own inviting practice. Example is generally more attractive and engaging than bare In&s;truction. The Example of Aged Per&s;ons carries a peculiar Authority &amp; Impre&s;&s;ion with it; their Juniors
<PB N="50" REF="002431_0056_0FDB4371C7BF0458">
being led, by a principle of Reverence and E&s;teem, to the Imitation of them. When therefore Aged People are carele&s;s and indiffe|rent about the public Wor&s;hip, and omit any Duties or Ordinances of it. They &s;et an ill Example, that will probably prove infectious and in&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aring, e&s;pecially to younger Ones, to their Children, and Servants, and others. It is then a very aggravated mi&s;-behaviour, and double Guilt in aged Per&s;ons, to neglect the Hou&s;e of God, or the Table of Chri&s;t. In them it &s;eems to be an open condemning the Divine Appointments, and giving a Judgment in favour of Irreligion, upon long ob&s;ervation or expe|rience: whence it often proves a &s;tumbling and Temptation to younger People. It is there|fore a very un&s;eemly, unnatural, and criminal thing in them. Hence then aged Per&s;ons &s;hould beware they don't &s;et an ill example in this matter: but on the contrary, let their Light &s;o &s;hine before others, that they may (by the winning Pattern) be induced in like manner to glorify God. Elder Chri&s;tians &s;hould go before others, and lead by their example in a diligent, reverent and early attendence on the public Wor&s;hip: Thus they'l take one happy method to propagate the &s;pirit of De|votion, and a Love to God's hou&s;e, unto coming Generations.</P>
<P>Finally. IN a word, It behoves aged People, to be very frequent, and double their dili|gence, in attending on public Wor&s;hip, in order to redeem the many Opportunities they have lo&s;t in the cour&s;e of their Lives, to repair
<PB N="51" REF="002431_0057_0FDB4376101FBF20">
former Defects, and make amends for pa&s;t Neglects, if it might be. <Q><HI>Omi&s;&s;ions</HI> are a grievous Article of Guilt, in the Saints Ac|compts; Pa&s;t Unprofitablene&s;s will lie <HI>heavy</HI> on a gracious heart, and be mo&s;t &s;en|&s;ibly re&s;ented by the mo&s;t faithful Servant; And his <HI>Inference</HI> is, <HI>Then</HI> let me redeem and improve the few days to come, with &s;o much the more Zeal!

And knowing you mu&s;t &s;hortly put off this your Tabernacle, con&s;ider what manner of Per&s;ons you ought to be in all holy Conver&s;ation and Godline&s;s.

IN every Generation God has had &s;ome, that have faithfully adhered to him, publickly own'd and wor&s;hip'd him. Some of all Ages, &s;ome of both Sexes; Old and Young, Male and Female. My Text leads me only to take notice of the <HI>Ancient,</HI> and the <HI>Female. Anna</HI> is the In&s;tance in our Text, who was a Widow of great Age, and departed not from the Tem|ple. And in the Chapter preceeding, we have another famous in&s;tance in aged <HI>Eli&s;abeth,</HI> of whom that excellent Character is given, <HI>&s;he was righteous before God, walking in all the Ordi|nances &amp; commandments of the Lord blamele&s;s.</HI>&mdash;And how many may we &s;uppo&s;e were <HI>Aged</HI> Women (be&s;ides <HI>Mary</HI> the Mother of our Lord) among the Daughters of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> that fol|lowed <HI>Je&s;us</HI> to his Cro&s;s; concerning whom we have that honourable Record, Act. 1. 14. <HI>They continued</HI> (with the Brethren) <HI>in prayer and Supplication with one accord.</HI>&mdash;Al&s;o among the <HI>honourable Women</HI> &amp; devout <HI>Greeks,</HI> of whom we read, (Act. 17.) that they <HI>received the word with all readine&s;s, and &s;earched the Scriptures daily,</HI>&mdash;We may &s;uppo&s;e not a few were Aged Ones.&mdash;No doubt they were chiefly <HI>ancient</HI> Matrons, that compos'd the <HI>Women's Meeting,</HI> to which <HI>Paul</HI> preached; as we read, Act. 16. 13. <HI>On the Sabbath we went out of the City by a River|side, where Prayer was wont to be made, and we &s;at down and &s;pake to the Women, which re&s;orted thither.</HI> We read of <HI>Mark'</HI>s pious Mother, at who&s;e hou&s;e many were gather'd together praying, <HI>Act.</HI> 12. 12. Furthermore, How cele|brated is <HI>Timothy's</HI> Grand-Mother <HI>Lois,</HI> and

<P>BUT what &s;hall I more &s;ay? For the time would fail me to tell of <HI>Eve</HI> (the Mother of all Living) and <HI>Sarah,</HI> and <HI>Rebekah,</HI> and <HI>Deborah</HI> her Nur&s;e; of <HI>Miriam,</HI> who pre&s;ided in an A&s;&s;embly of pious Women of I&s;rael, leading the Song in the prai&s;es of God, as afterwards did <HI>Deborah</HI> that judged I&s;rael; &s;o likewi&s;e <HI>Huldah,</HI> the Prophete&s;s, who is &s;aid to dwell in the College at Jeru&s;alem; and <HI>Naomi,</HI> and <HI>Hannah,</HI> and <HI>Bath&s;heba,</HI> and many other holy Women in old time, who tru&s;ted in God, and continued in Supplications and Prayers; who brought forth fruit in old Age, and were &s;till flouri&s;hing in the Courts of the Lord.</P>
<P>IN all Ages of the Church there have been &s;ome &s;uch; Daughters that have done virtu|ou&s;ly; and aged Mothers in I&s;rael, that have
<PB N="54" REF="002431_0060_0FDB437DB2595FB0">
<HI>excelled</HI> in Virtue and been &s;hining Patterns of vital Piety and Devotion. In <HI>Church Hi&s;tory</HI> we meet with many In&s;tances, worthy to be added unto tho&s;e which the <HI>Scripture-Story</HI> pre&s;ents us withal.</P>
<P>AND no part of the World (I believe) is capable of furni&s;hing out a better Hi&s;tory, than <HI>New-England,</HI> the place of our happy Abode; which (through the Grace of God) has hi|therto been very highly favoured and honored in this Regard. From the beginning to this day, our pious praying Mothers (who always make up a con&s;iderble part of our Congregations for Wor&s;hip) have been in no little degree the Strength and Beauty of our Churches.</P>
<P>BUT alas! How is the Glory departing from us, in this re&s;pect as well as others! The fir&s;t &s;tock of godly Men &amp; Women is long &s;ince extin|gui&s;hed. Their Succe&s;&s;ors fell &s;hort of them abundantly, both in number and worth; as the pre&s;ent Generation does even of them. Yet (ble&s;&s;ed be God) there is &s;till a remnant among us, in whom the power and life of Religion is vi&s;i|ble; &s;ome aged Women as well as Men pro|fe&s;&s;ing Godline&s;s, who&s;e grave Faces and good Deportment in the Hou&s;e of God and at his Table, add no little beauty and &s;olemnity to our wor&s;hipping A&s;&s;emblies.&mdash;May they &s;till live, our Glory and Joy, our Strength and Safety! And the Lord God of our Fathers make them a thou&s;and times &s;o many as they are; and ble&s;s them as He hath promi&s;ed, &s;aying, <HI>Even to old age I am He, and even to hoar hairs will I carry you and deliver you!</HI> I&s;ai. 46. 4.</P>

<P>V. <HI>AMONG other Saints, the</HI> aged Handmaids <HI>of the Lord do particularly de&s;erve a Name in I&s;rael; are to be highly e&s;teem'd and honour'd, and their Memory reverenc'd after their Decea&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>WE are required to honor all them that fear the Lord, but e&s;pecially the <HI>aged</HI> Saints. The&s;e are, while <HI>living,</HI> to have a peculiar Re&s;pect &s;hown them. What&s;oever, Infirmities natural or moral may attend them, yet they are worthy of double Honour from us. Lev. 19. 32. <HI>Thou &s;halt ri&s;e up before the hoary Head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God.</HI> So 1 Tim. 5. <HI>Rebuke not</HI> (magi&s;teri|ally) <HI>an aged Per&s;on, but intreat him as a Fa|ther, and the elder Women as Mothers.

E&s;pecially the Children of &s;uch &s;hould put this Honour upon them. Hence the Apo&s;tle adds, <HI>If any Widow have Children or Nephews</HI> (Grand-children or other near Relations) <HI>let them learn fir&s;t to &s;hew Piety at home, and to requite their Parents, for this is good and acceptable before God.</HI>&mdash;The fifth Commandment requires Children to ho|nour their Father and Mother, and that how|ever aged.
