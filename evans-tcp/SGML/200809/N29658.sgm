<P>THE Things of greate&s;t moment are by mo&s;t men little believed, le&s;s con&s;ider|ed, till it be too late; That be&s;ides this pre&s;ent World, (which mu&s;t have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> period) there is another World of in|ternal duration: And that according to our choi&s;e&punc; life, and doing here will our doom and eternal ha|bitation be in the World to come; &s;o that there is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n indi&s;pen&s;ible Nece&s;&s;ity to make ready for a ble&s;|&s;ed Life of Immortality.

under the &s;econd part. <HI>viz. The Bridegroomes coming to fetch home his Bride:</HI> O welcome day! The words &s;erve as a Gla&s;s or bright Sun-beam, to repre&s;ent the different e&s;tate of believers and unbelievers, wi&s;e and fooli&s;h Virgins, at Chri&s;ts coming by Death or Judgement.</P>
<P>In which ob&s;erve three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. The preparation of the wi&s;e Virgins, <HI>They were ready.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Their Welcome and Admi&s;&s;ion to the Marriage, <HI>They went in with him,</HI> i e. <HI>into the Pre&s;ence-Chamber of the King of Glory.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. We have the doleful Rejection and Exclu&s;ion of the fooli&s;h Virgins, <HI>And the Door was &s;hut.</HI></P>
<P>The Doctrine that I &s;hall Collect and Handle from the words is this, <HI>They and only &s;uch who are graciou&s;ly qualified and prepared for Chri&s;t in this World, &s;hall enjoy eternal Fellow&s;hip and Communion with Christ in the other World.</HI></P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of our happine&s;s that we &s;hall have in Heaven lies in this, <HI>That we &s;hall be with Chri&s;t.</HI> Do&s;t thou de&s;ire a better Countrey? <HI>viz. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;afe to Heaven</HI>: Keep thine eye ever upon thine end, and know that here life is gotten or lo&s;t to Eternity. Sinner, do not deceive thy &s;elf, to hope for Heaven, and do the work of Hell; if thou do&s;t expect to go in with Chri&s;t, and enjoy God and glory hereafter, daily u&s;e the means, and go in the way to Heaven here. There is a congruity between the way and the end: They an&s;wer one another, as face an|&s;wereth face in the water; or as the War and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Seal, the Voice and the Eco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> an&s;wer each <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.

they drink, and receive wages according to their work; and as you &s;ow you reap: the Harve&s;t is the end of the World; they that were ready went in, not one more. Heaven con&s;i&s;teth partly in the fit|ne&s;s and preparation of the Soul and body for that ble&s;&s;ed Society above. The Paradi&s;e of God would be a Pri&s;on, may I not &s;ay a hell, to the impious and unholy.</P>
<P>Sore eyes cannot behold the Sun without grief, Swine will not &s;tay in the mo&s;t plea&s;ant Medows <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hence, no work &s;o irk&s;ome as Chri&s;ts, no time &s;o uncomfortable and tedious to wicked men, as abi|ding under Chri&s;ts wings in his Ordinances.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to &s;peak to the &s;everal branches in the Doctrine, I mu&s;t enter a Caveat or Caution.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, this Meetne&s;s, Fitne&s;s, and Preparation for Heaven, is not to be under&s;tood in a way of Popi&s;h Purgation or Merits, <HI>viz.</HI> by <HI>Prayers, Acts of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ifi|cence, Almes, Pilgrimages, Penance, Purgatory, &amp;c.</HI> The Reward is of Grace, not of Debt, or De&s;ert, for <HI>all our Righteou&s;ne&s;&s;es are but as filthy rags; and when we have done all we art but unprofitable Servants</HI> (&s;aith our Sa|viour,) <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 64.6. <HI>Luke</HI> 17.10. Our good hope and everla&s;ting con&s;olation is through grace.</P>
<P>Secondly, the readine&s;s is not to be under&s;tood&punc; as if all that &s;hall go to Heaven with Chri&s;t have an inherent, &s;inle&s;s, and per&s;onal Perfection; As Stars have their twinklings, and Diamonds their flaws, and the be&s;t Gold doth need &s;ome grain of al|lowance, &s;o the mo&s;t eminent Chri&s;tians have their frailties and mixtures of corruption. <HI>Solomon</HI> chal|lengeth the whole world, when he &s;aith&punc; <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ay I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> made my heart clean, I am pure from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> 'Tis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> there is a generation pure in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> yet, you are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> from their filthine&s;s,</HI> Prov. 30, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.

And if none die comfortably, or go in with Chri&s;t but tho&s;e who have lived per|fectly, then every man mu&s;t go out of the World with de&s;pair and terrour; for the failings of Gods People are more than their duties, their Corruptions more than their Graces: &s;o that whoever goes to Heaven, mu&s;t be beholding to the redeem|ing blood, and ju&s;tifying righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Lord Je&s;us. This being premi&s;ed, I &s;hall proceed to the Explanation of the Doctrine, in which I &s;hall ob&s;erve this Order and Method.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t &s;hew, <HI>That there is a Fitne&s;s and Preparedne&s;s in Believers for their future &s;tate of ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>That this Fitne&s;s is in the day and time of Life, not after Death.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>What this Fitne&s;s for Chri&s;t &amp; Heaven is.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>I &s;hall give the Rea&s;ons upon which all must prepare, and why none el&s;e mu&s;t goe with Christ.</HI></P>

<P>FIr&s;t, <HI>That Believers are divinely qualified for their &s;tate of Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; being a People made ready and prepared for the Lord,</HI> Luke 1.17. That tho&s;e wi&s;e Virgins are fit and accounted worthy to go in with Chri&s;t, will appear three ways.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, by their int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">fecal Endowments and Qua|lifications, or what God hath done in them</P>
<P>Secondly, by the choice Epithites and Titles given to them.</P>
<P>Thirdly, their Priviledges and Regalities with which they are inve&s;ted and ennobled.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, their inward Frame and Con&s;titution dot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> exceed the whole World. There is mo&s;t rare, curi+ous and inimitable work of the Divine Spirit upon the &s;ouls of all that &s;hall go in with Chri&s;t. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|vers are his Workman&s;hip; They are renewed in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Spirit of their mind, and have put on the new man, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

after God is created in righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s. They are holy Brethren, Partakers of the heavenly Calling, and a divine Nature, and transformed and changed from glory to glory into the &s;ame Image.</HI> They are &s;aid <HI>to be called to Glory and Vertue,</HI> and the life they live is cal|led <HI>the Life of God,</HI> and their conver&s;ation is &s;aid <HI>to be in Heaven,</HI> Eph 2.10. Eph 4.23, 24. Heb. 3.1. 2 Pet. 1.4. 2 Cor. 3.17.</P>
<P>Secondly, their Titles do &s;peak their Fitne&s;s; They are called, <HI>the Children of the Bride-chamber, Children of the Kingdom, Children of the Re&s;urrestion, Chri&s;ts fair One, the Kings Daughter, Gods Jewels, his peculiar Trea&s;ure, his excellent Ones, &s;uch of whom the World is not worthy.</HI></P>
<P>What is the chaff to the Wheat, or pebbles to Pearls, or clods of Earth to the bright Stars, or the children of hell to the&s;e earthly Angels. The Name of a Chri&s;tian is a mo&s;t honourable Name. <HI>Alexander</HI> thought him&s;elf happy that he might be named <HI>Achilles,</HI> and <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> if he might be called <HI>Alexander.</HI> The Believers Name is of greater Renown. <HI>Solon</HI> was called <HI>the Wonder of</HI> Greece, <HI>and the Glory of the</HI> Greeks, but he was not to compare with the meane&s;t Saint. <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> and <HI>Valentinian,</HI> two famous Em|perours, called them&s;elves <HI>Va&s;&s;allos Chri&s;ti,</HI> the Va&s;&s;als of Chri&s;t; and <HI>Theodo&s;ius</HI> another Emperour profe&s;&s;ed, <HI>It was more honour to him, to be</HI> Membrum Eccle&s;iae quam Caput Imperii, <HI>a Member of the Church, than Head of the Empire.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, their Priviledges al&s;o do evidence this Fitne&s;s, which are all Royal&punc;</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, they have a Royal De&s;cent, and &s;o the Sons and Daughters of the Lord God Almighty, <HI>My Fir&s;t-born,</HI> &s;aith the Lord of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> of his people. We read of the children of ba&s;e men, viler than the Earth, <HI>Job</HI> 30.8. <HI>Jezabel</HI> is called a cur&s;ed woman, though a Kings Daughter. <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> is called an abomi|nable branch, and <HI>Antiochus Epiphanes,</HI> a vile per&s;on.
<PB N="6" REF="039482_0008_101425765C49FD38">
Believers are of God, and born not of blood, nor of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of men, but from above, <HI>John</HI> 3.</P>
<P>Secondly, Moreover they have a Royal Spirit. <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> told <HI>Daniel. In him was the Spirit of the holy Gods. Jo&s;hua</HI> and <HI>Caleb</HI> (that entred into the holy Land) were men of another &s;pirit, <HI>Numb</HI> 14 24. This Spirit that fits them for Heaven is a holy Spi|rit, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.4 <HI>A Spirit of Grace, a Spirit of Glory.</HI> 1 Pet 4 14 So called, becau&s;e it comes from the God of Glory, and prepares them for Glory.</P>
<P>Thirdly, they have Royal Offices, and are em|ployed about Royal bu&s;ine&s;s They are Kings and Prie&s;ts, who&s;e Employment is Prayer &amp; divine prai&s;e, <HI>Rev</HI> 1.6. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 6 24. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.5, 9</P>
<P>Fourthly, they have Royal attendance, the glo|rious Angels; the&s;e Watchers who are great in &s;trength, &s;tand as Sentinels at their doors to protect their Per&s;ons, day and night while they live: And they mu&s;t Convey their Souls thorough the Devils Territories &s;afe to the Place of their everla&s;ting habi|tation, after they are dead, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 34 8 <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.14. <HI>Luke</HI> 16.22. If you are by Grace prepared for Glo|ry. God is your God, and this is your Guard.</P>
<P>Fifthly: they have a Royal Law, which is the Rule and Standard of their Obedience to God. <HI>Jam.</HI> 2. 8. The Writing was the Writing of God, who was both the Doctator and the Scribe, <HI>Exod.</HI> 32.16. where note, that the Scripture is the word of God, <HI>John</HI> 10 35.</P>
<P>Sixthly, they have Royal Apparel a Royal pre|&s;ence, and belong to a Royal City: and when they go in with Chri&s;t, they &s;hall be on the Throne Roy|al, and have the Crown-Royal.</P>
<P>It cannot be denied, but that they are &s;et apart for God, and fitted for his Pre&s;ence, <HI>P&s;al</HI> 4 3 <HI>God hath &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the man that is godly for him&s;elf.</HI> Mire &s;egre|gavit cum indicio excellentiae, (<HI>&s;aith one upon the

Place</HI>) God hath gloriou&s;ly, wonderfully, miracu|lou&s;ly &s;eparated to him&s;elf the godly man. Here Note.</P>
<P>That we do not make our &s;elves fit, or meet for Heaven, God mu&s;t do it. <HI>Who can make his heart clean?</HI> we may wa&s;h the out-&s;ide of the Cup, God mu&s;t clean&s;e that which is within, <HI>viz.</HI> the heart, from wickedne&s;s. <HI>I am the Lord that healeth thee.</HI></P>
<P>Chri&s;tians are made fit by Redemption, by Voca|tion, by Adoption, by Ju&s;tification, by Sanctifica|tion.</P>
<P>This &s;hall cau&s;e the godly to wonder at the Pow|er of Divine Grace. If a King ca&s;t his favour on a mean &s;ubject or &s;lave, and prefer him to a great and honourable Office, yet he cannot change his na|ture, and give him fitne&s;s for that place: But God doth not only give a Kingdom to his Saints, but in|wardly adapt, and fit them for that Kingdom. And as none had right to the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> but the <HI>I&s;rae|lites,</HI> &s;o none have right to Heaven but the Saints; (but of this more afterwards.)</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<P>SEcondly, <HI>This Readine&s;s is in the day and time of Life, not after death. Oh that thou had&s;t known in this thy day</HI> (&s;aid Chri&s;t to the Jews) <HI>the things that belong to thy peace.</HI> There is a time known and ap|pointed of God, after which they &s;hall never repent and be converted, who have enjoyed and lived un|der the means of grace, and are not converted. 'Tis true, the eternal God is not limited to any term or means, but man is limited to time and means. Sin|ner, thou ha&s;t a great work to do, a long journey to go, and many and mighty adver&s;aries to divert and hinder thee; thy Work is to prepare for Death and Judgment, which is very near; thy Voyage or Jour|ney is to the everla&s;ting World, Provi&s;ion mu&s;t be

made while in the way. To apply this a little, and to quicken you to husband the precious Talent of Time in order to Eternity. I &s;hall propo&s;e three things; Fir&s;t, con&s;ider how &s;hort and uncertain our being in the World is. Secondly, as life is &s;hort, &s;o the continuance of the means of grace will not be long Thirdly, when gray hairs, old age, &s;ick|ne&s;s, (<HI>Solomons</HI> evil day) comes, that is not &s;o fit and proper a &s;ea&s;on to prepare for Heaven: Fir&s;t, re|member how &s;hort and uncertain thy being in the World is; <HI>Our life is but a vapour,</HI> Jam. 4 14. that &s;oon appeareth and di&s;appeareth, di&s;per&s;ed as &s;oon as rai&s;ed. 'Tis a little &s;pot of time between two Eter|nities. One of the Ancients doubteth, whether to call it a dying life, or a living death: And if our life (which is a breathing death) had been le&s;s then a vapour, it had been nothing at all. The P&s;almi&s;t de&s;cribes Man as <HI>Gra&s;s,</HI> P&s;al. 90 <HI>In the Morning it flouri&s;heth, in the Evening it is cut down, and withereth.</HI></P>
<P>Man continueth but a very &s;hort time, his life is but a &s;pan long, or but a day long, like <HI>Jonah</HI>'s Gourd, came up in a night, and peri&s;hed in a night. The fir&s;t &s;tep man &s;ets upon the &s;tage of this World, he is going out of the World. The Naturali&s;ts &s;peak of a Fly they call <HI>Ephemeron,</HI> a creature of one day, which cometh forth in the Morning, is very active about Noon, but when the Sun declineth, it declineth too, and &s;ets with the &s;etting of the Sun.</P>
<P>Man is an <HI>Ephemeron,</HI> a creature of one day. The Ancient of days &s;ets up our Gla&s;s in Heaven, there at is running, and we &s;ee not how it ha&s;tens to an end. Think, O devout &s;oul, of the &s;ugarity and &s;wiftne&s;s of thy time here below, the Line and Lea&s;e of Life will quickly be out: It is but a point of time that we live, while we do but turn, Immor|tality is pre&s;ent. This pre&s;ent Life is but the

place of our Inn and Sepulchre; The Beginning of this Life is but the <HI>Exordium</HI> of Death, <HI>Vita hujus Principtum statim Mortis e&s;t Exordium</HI> We are carried every moment of time to the <HI>End of Time.</HI> Our Life is but but like one &s;ailing; he who doth &s;ail, whe|ther he &s;tand or &s;it, whether he &s;leep, watch or walk, he is carried nearer the Port; may we not &s;ay with old <HI>Jacob,</HI> Gen 47.4 <HI>Few and evil have the days of the years of my life been</HI>: where we have his Ac|count ca&s;t up; God is the great Landlord of our time, the Lea&s;e is for life, not years but days, not many days but few. <HI>Life</HI> (&s;aid one) <HI>is a Ro&s;e which if we view in its growth the Cold nips it, the Heat wi|thers it, the Wind &s;hakes it, be it never &s;o fair it withers:</HI> Another &s;aith, <HI>Life is a counterfeit, what if the Colours be fair, and the Re&s;emblance near, the Shadows of Death, and the Curtains of the Grave will darken all</HI>; 'Tis a Play, We enter at our Birth, and Act all our Life, pre&s;ently there is an <HI>Exit,</HI> or end, and away we go. One being asked what was Life, he &s;hews him&s;elf a little, and hides him&s;elf again, his mean|ing was this. Our Life is but a little &s;hew, no &s;ooner are we &s;een, but immediately we are hid and gone. O &s;leepy and &s;ecure &s;inner, think of the certainty of Death, the danger of thy Soul, the nearne&s;s and length of Eternity, and the Nece&s;|&s;ity of preparing in a moment of time for an ever|la&s;ting e&s;tate. Die and leave the World we mu&s;t, in the Grave there is no work, after Death the Judgement, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9 27. Sin poi&s;ons the Arrow in the Quiver of the King of Terrours, and puts the Sythe into Deaths hand that cuts us down&punc; Methinks Sins &s;peaks to the &s;everal Generations of men whom Death hath conquered, as <HI>David</HI> to the Prie&s;t who had e&s;caped <HI>Sauls</HI> bloody &s;word, <HI>I have been the occa&s;ion of all this.</HI> Sin and Death are coupled to|gether, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8 2.</P>
<P>Secondly, as Life is &s;hort, &s;o the continuance
<PB N="10" REF="039482_0012_101425824CA56570">
of the means of Grace will not be long.

<P>We have but a little time to intreat and to treat with you about your Souls, to call, invite and per|&s;wade you to come to Chri&s;t, and accept of mercy: and which Mini&s;ter or Sermon &s;hall be the la&s;t thou &s;halt hear, who can tell? <HI>There are &s;ix days,</HI> &s;aid the Ma&s;ter of the Synagogue, <HI>Luke</HI> 13. <HI>in which men ought to work, in them therefore come and be healed.

Moreover, as the Mini&s;try and outward means is uncertain, &s;o the time of the Spirits working with the Word is uncertain, <HI>My Spirit &s;hall not always &s;trive with man:</HI> The Spirit is compared to the Wind, who can tell when the Wind will blow, and how long it will continue its &s;weet gales to convey us to glory. The Door of grace is yet open to lo&s;t and undone &s;inners, who have &s;lighted mercy. God did not deal &s;o with the Angels that fell, they &s;inned, and the Lord ca&s;t them down, and &s;hut the Gate of Glory upon them immediately.

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<P>THirdly, <HI>Let us now enquire what this Prepara|ration to go in with Chri&s;t is.</HI> And I wi&s;h that all who read this Di&s;cour&s;e may under&s;tand it, not only notionally, and &s;peculatively, but al&s;o heartily and experimentally.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this third Particular, here is &s;ome|thing Negatively, and &s;omething Po&s;itively, and both in reference to believers and unbelievers.</P>
<P>Negatively, Preparation for Chri&s;t and Heaven, doth not lie or con&s;i&s;t in any thing that is natural, or acquired by mans utmo&s;t indu&s;try. Let the Qualifications, Endowments, Improvements and Attainments of men be never &s;o rare &amp; excellent, while without &s;upernatural regenerating Grace, they cannot be fit and prepared for immediate &amp; eternal fellow&s;hip with God. To explicate this, take the&s;e four Particulars.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Readine&s;s for Chri&s;t and Heaven doth not con&s;i&s;t in being Virgins, <HI>i. e.</HI> Church Members,
<PB N="13" REF="039482_0015_10142587B5B7B580">
and in having the &s;pecious leaves of Profe&s;&s;ion. There are more than a few who pretend to and profe&s;s the true Religion, that are carnal, rotten &amp; fal&s;e in that Religion: All in the vi&s;ible Church, that are &s;ealed with the Sign and Sacrament of Initiation, are not fit for Divine Communion. <HI>Ni|codemus</HI> was Circumci&s;ed, yet not fit for the King|dom of Heaven <HI>Judas</HI> was an Apo&s;tle &amp; Preacher, but the Son of Perdition: <HI>Simon Magus</HI> was Bap|tized, and in the gall of Bitterne&s;s.</P>
<P>Many think, 'tis &s;ufficient to &s;ave them, that they were born in <HI>England,</HI> and de&s;cended of Re|ligious or Prote&s;tant Parents, that they keep their Church, &s;ay their Prayers, receive the Lords Sup|per, and procure their ab&s;olution when dying; The unbelieving <HI>Jews</HI> gloried in their External Rites and Priviledges, crying out, <HI>The Temple of the Lord!</HI> And becau&s;e they had their Prie&s;ts and Sacrifices and could go up to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to wor&s;hip, they were (as they thought) the happie&s;t people in the whole world. How many Athei&s;ts and Haters of God and Holine&s;s, have been Baptized? Re&s;t not here; for he is not a <HI>Jew</HI> that is one out|wardly, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.28. <HI>Gal.</HI> 6.13.

<P>Secondly, Neither doth it con&s;i&s;t in trimming of <HI>Lamp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, i. e.</HI> in External Duties and Religious Acts, which to the view of the world may be &s;plendid and very plau&s;ible. <HI>Bona opera non fa|ciunt bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">um <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">irum, &s;ed vir bonus facit opera bona<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Luther.</HI> Good works do not make a good man, but a good man makes good works Unregenarate men their &s;ervices proceed from the &s;ame princi|ple that their &s;ins do.

<P>Thirdly, Neither doth this readine&s;s for Chri&s;t lie in being of &s;uch a party, and opinion, or in being hot and zealous for &s;uch modes and forms of Religion and Wor&s;hip. A man may be Epi&s;|copal, a Presbyterian, an Independent, an Anabap|ti&s;t, and a &s;tranger to the Life and Power of Reli|gion. The <HI>Jews,</HI> High Prie&s;ts, and Elders: The Scribes and Phari&s;ees were zealous for <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> Law, the Cu&s;tom and Traditions of their Fathers; but the wor&s;t Enemies Chri&s;t had.

<P>Fourthly, Neither doth it lie in mental Illumi|nations and excellent rare Parts, Gifts, Common Grace, and good Opinion, and Approbation of the be&s;t, mo&s;t &s;erious and judicious men. A mans Mind and Intellectuals may be Adorned with rare Notions; he may be able to di&s;pute mo&s;t readily, accurately and profoundly about Theological

Principles; he may Pray and Preach like an An|gel, and be in high e&s;teem in the Church; and yet have nothing in him to Intitle him to Chri&s;t, and prepare him for heaven.

<P>Having &s;poken &s;omething in the Negative con|cerning this fitne&s;s and readine&s;s for Chri&s;t. I proceed now to the Po&s;itive part of my An&s;wer, wherein it doth con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is an initial, or an habitual readine&s;s for Heaven, and there is al&s;o a more actual fitne&s;s to go in with Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as a man is taken out of his Natural Soil, and the Seed of God is &s;own in his heart, he is habitually ready for his future Happine&s;s. If a Believer &s;hould Die the fir&s;t Day of his Con|ver&s;ion, he would certainly go to Heaven, witne&s;s the Thief upon the Cro&s;s. But truly there are many dear Children of God not actually prepared, becau&s;e their Spiritual E&s;tate is not &s;o well &s;ettled. 'Tis a great Duty for all that are e&s;pou&s;ed to Chri&s;t, to be in a con&s;tant and continual readine&s;s to meet Chri&s;t, and have immediate Communion with him: but &s;ad experience proves it is not &s;o. A Woman may be E&s;pou&s;ed to another, and yet &s;he may be &s;ometimes not ready to meet him

her Ornaments may be off, and her &s;oul Apparel on. To Re&s;olve this I &s;hall &s;hew.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, When the Chri&s;tian is not Ready.</P>
<P>Secondly, When he is actually Ready.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, When the Believers Soul, like <HI>Hezekiah</HI>'s Sun, is gone &s;ome degrees backward, <HI>i. e.</HI> under re|markable declinings; And the be&s;t things in him are ready to die, <HI>viz.</HI> Grace, Inward Joy, Peace, Old Experiences, Godly Sorrow are ready to die. If the fir&s;t warm, burning, flaming Love of the E&s;pou&s;als be le&s;&s;ened, and much abated towards Chri&s;t, &s;o that the mans heart doth vigorou&s;ly go forth after &s;en&s;ual Objects, and the Dead Child is put in the place of the Living Child; is he fit to go in with Chri&s;t? If Grace be under remarkable decays and witherings, and the Souls <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">auty de|parted, can a man then welcome Chri&s;t? What cau&s;e have thou&s;ands to Cry out with the Prophet, <HI>My Leanne&s;s! My Leanne&s;s!</HI> Is it not Autumn or Winter in many a Soul? How little life and love have you, and much ado to maintain it. I heard a good Woman, in a de&s;pairing condition, complain of want of Natural Affection to her Hus|band and Children. And may we not with ho|ly <HI>Bradford,</HI> weep for want of love to our deare&s;t Lord and embracing the bo&s;om of a Stranger. If the Wives affection be withdrawn from her Hus|bands Per&s;on is &s;he fit now to appear before him, when &s;he hath no heart to receive him? There|fore &s;trengthen the things that are ready to die, blow up the &s;park of love into a flame, and thou may&s;t &s;ay, <HI>Come, Lord Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, When the poor Chri&s;tian, being un|der De&s;ertion, is doubtful of his Eternal Condi|tion, and cannot tell what will be his place when he leaves the world, he is unfit. When thick
<PB N="18" REF="039482_0020_101806AE5DCECC60">
Mi&s;ts &s;urround us, and black Clouds cover us, the many &s;inking fears, jealou&s;ies and damping doubts about the love of Chri&s;t renders us Un|ready. This is the ca&s;e of many a Soul who hath made choice of God to be his, and wonders at his love to him, yet is ready to &s;peak as the Church, <HI>Zion &s;aid, The Lord hath for&s;aken me, my God hath forgotten me,</HI> I&s;a. 49.14. <HI>My Soul is cast down,</HI> &s;aith <HI>David, within me, all his billows pa&s;s over me; hath God forgotten to be Gracious?</HI> I doubt my heart is not upright, that my foundation is not &s;ound, that I &s;hall be &s;hut out of Heaven, &s;aith the de&s;|ponding Soul. <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> tho' he walked before God with a perfect heart, yet bitterly complain|ed that he was cut off. A very Holy and Learned Mini&s;ter complains thus, <HI>I have often di&s;puted, whether or no I knew any thing of Chri&s;tianity, ex|cept the Letter of the Name.</HI></P>
<P>The Woman in Mr, <HI>Bolton</HI> &s;aid, <HI>I have been the Mother of Nine Children, and have born them with as much Pain as mo&s;t Women, yet I could be contented to bear the &s;ame Pain every Day, that I have endured with all my Children, to be a&s;&s;ured of my Part in Chri&s;t.</HI> Another Cried out, <HI>He could be contented that his Body &s;hould burn in Hell a Thou&s;and Years, &s;o that he might be a&s;&s;ured of the least Favour from God after|wards. And will you not pity me,</HI> &s;aith Mrs. <HI>Drake, that mu&s;t burn in Hell for ever?</HI> Sirs, in a time of De&s;ertion, when God hides his Face, and Heaven is out of &s;ight, the Child of Light walks in Dark|ne&s;s, the Soul is not ready. The thoughts of God are terrible. <HI>I remembred God, and was troubled,</HI> &s;aith <HI>David, I &s;ink, the deep waters are come into my Soul. The Arrows of the Almighty are within me, the Poi&s;on whereof drinketh up my &s;pirit: the Terrors of God do

Another walking in the Field (&s;eeing a Fly) Cried out, <HI>This Fly comes Armed with the Wrath of God against me.</HI> Now when the trembling Soul apprehends it &s;elf to hang like an equal ballance between two Eterni|ties, and cannot tell whether he &s;hall go up or down, live or die, be &s;aved or damned; he is not fit to &s;hoot the Gulf: This made <HI>David</HI> Pray, P&s;al. 39 ult. <HI>Spare me a little before I go hence and be no more.</HI></P>
<P>Here Note, That there is a double De&s;peration, <HI>A De&s;peration of Infidelity,</HI> and, <HI>A De&s;peration of Ex|tremity</HI>; The former, <HI>viz.</HI> A total and perpetual De&s;peration, none of Gods Elect ones &s;hall fall under: but the latter, the De&s;peration of Extremi|ty, (which doth cure their &s;tupidity, and provoke and prompt them to the u&s;e of the means) they are obnoxious to: They are &s;ometimes brought very low in their Souls. <HI>Luther,</HI> by rea&s;on of the trouble of his mind, wi&s;h'd he had never been a man. The Chri&s;tian &s;its &s;olitary as a Widow for|&s;aken, his &s;ighs are many, and his heart is faint, when God covers Him&s;elf with a Cloud. This made a Godly Woman dying (who&s;e Evidences for Heaven could not be read) Pray, <HI>Lord, Let me not go to the Place where the Wicked are, for I never loved them in my Life.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, After &s;ome &s;ad Fall, and when a man is under &s;ome violent Temptation, on Pa&s;&s;ion, he is Unready. A Good Man may be under the power of &s;ome &s;udden, hot and &s;inful Pa&s;&s;ion, and a&s;&s;aulted with an helli&s;h Temptation, he may be tempted to Cur&s;e and Bla&s;pheme God, to De&s;troy him&s;elf; he may be bereaved of his Rea&s;on and

Under&s;tanding, and be ragingly Mad: Pa&s;&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is the Law of the Soul, and <HI>brevis in&s;ania,</HI> a &s;hort Madne&s;s. <HI>Job</HI> and <HI>Jeremiah</HI> in their Pa&s;&s;ion, did both Cur&s;e the Day of their Birth; <HI>Jonas</HI> told God, <HI>He did well to be angry.</HI> Moreover, after a Chri&s;ti|an hath fallen into &s;ome gro&s;s foul &s;in God may frown and write bitter things again&s;t him, fill his Con&s;cience with terror, hang him over Hell, and threaten to remove him out of his &s;ight: till he hath renewed his Repentance. A foul Fall doth &s;o grieve the Spirit, that it may make God carry him&s;elf towards his as if he were an Enemy. God doth deal with his for their great Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, as <HI>David</HI> with <HI>Ab&s;olom,</HI> who commanded him out of his &s;ight, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 14.24 In this &s;ad and deplo|rable Ca&s;e, Evidences for Heaven are blurred, and all old Experiences of the Love and Favour of God are under Ground. <HI>David</HI> after his fall was as a Dead man, and Prayed, <HI>Ca&s;t me not away from thy pre&s;ence,</HI> P&s;al. 51.11.</P>
<P>Fourthly, When a man hath Omitted known and commanded Duties, let down his Watch, and neglected his Lords Work: and falls a nodding, or into a Lethargy, (as the&s;e Virgins did) till rou&s;ed up with the Cry of Midnight, he is not prepared to go in with Chri&s;t. If a Mans Con&s;cience draweth up a black Bill of Indictment again&s;t him, for the neglect of the mo&s;t weighty and important Duties, he is no more fit to meet Chri&s;t, than <HI>Adam</HI> after he had eaten the Forbid|den Fruit, or a Steward who had much betru&s;ted him to improve for his Lords u&s;e, and let all &s;ea|&s;ons go wherein he might have Traded &amp; G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in'd &s;omewhat for him.

O thus it is with many a Chri&s;tian, who hath lo&s;t that vigour, zeal, activity and forwardne&s;s for the Work of God that once he had. Hence come tho&s;e &s;ad A|larms, &s;tings &amp; convictions of Con&s;cience, &s;hakings and &s;inkings of &s;pirit under the &s;en&s;e of guilt.</P>
<P>And is not this the ca&s;e of many Virgins? &s;o that if Chri&s;t &s;hould arre&s;t, and &s;ummon them by death, and call them to <HI>reddere rationem,</HI> give an Account, how many mu&s;t An&s;wer, <HI>Not ready Lord, my work is not done.</HI> O then betimes do your work, and &s;et things right in your &s;ouls every day.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>When is a Chri&s;tian actually ready?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> A Chri&s;tian is actually ready when he hath tho&s;e rare and gracious qualifications of the wi&s;e Virgins, (<HI>viz.</HI>) his Ve&s;&s;el clean, and the Oyl in his Lamp and Ve&s;&s;el, <HI>i. e.</HI> The Spirit of Chri&s;t &amp; the graces of the Spirit: which are called Rows of Jewels, Chains of Gold, and Rivers of Living Water. This is the Anointing, 1 <HI>Job.</HI> 2.27.

The Law was written on the two Tables with the Finger of God, and this upon the hid|den man of the heart, is al&s;o the Lords Work, and mar|vellous in our eyes.

<P>Chri&s;tians, you mu&s;t not only have Grace habitu|ally, but actually, in its mo&s;t lively and vigorous exerci&s;e, to prepare you for Heaven.

the new man is very weak and feeble in very many. What are become of the graces, comforts, and delights of the Spirit? This &s;treem doth not run, Rivers of Living Water do not flow out of our Bellies: Where is the old &s;tock, and the new in|crea&s;e? That plenty and fulne&s;s of the Spirit, that mu&s;t ripen our Souls and make us ready? If grace like the hou&s;e of <HI>David</HI> did revive, and wax &s;tronger and &s;tronger in you, it would cure your Stupor and Security: and give you (bear with the expre&s;&s;ion) a fre&s;h Start, or new Alarm for Heaven. That grace is not in the gaining hand, is mo&s;t apparent by your letting down your Watch, and falling a&s;leep. By your Li&s;tle&s;sne&s;s to Duties, and want of Life, and affection in them, by them, by the prevalency of cor|ruption, and decay of Godly &s;orrow for &s;in, and in|ward peace, by the blotting of your Evidences for heaven, and want of communion with Chri&s;t, who &s;tands aloof off from the withered &amp; decayed Chri&s;ti|an. Friend, do&s;t then not hear the Lord &s;ay, I have &s;omething again&s;t thee becau&s;e thou ha&s;t lo&s;t thy fir&s;t Love? We read of the fir&s;t days of <HI>David,</HI> and of the fir&s;t Ripe Fruits; The fir&s;t Fruits of the Spirit; the love of the E&s;pou&s;als. But where &s;hall we find it? What is become of the &s;weet Incen&s;e of Pray|er and Prai&s;e, thou wa&s;t wont to &s;end up to heaven? The time was, thou could&s;t be early and late with God by &s;olemn and &s;ecret Prayer, and direct, and dart up thy &s;oul to heaven often in a day, by oc|ca&s;ional ejaculatory Prayers, Is not this golden Lamp gone out? Was there never a Spirit of Pray|er among Gods People in this Nation? What is become of that inward affection in Prayer, where &s;hall we find it? Is all our Religion re&s;olv'd into forms and formality? How little &s;piritual Wor|&s;hip hath God by the be&s;t of us, who will accept of no other Wor&s;hip? Where are tho&s;e frequent

<Q><HI>Que&s;tion.</HI> Do all Gods People (who &s;hall go in with Chri&s;t) die in a comfortable condition, and with <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;ee the Promi&s;ed Land: or have they a Pro&s;pect of their heavenly Country?</Q>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> No: Scripture and Experience prove the contrary. And here I &s;hall lay down &s;ome Particu|lars, both to quicken and &s;upport Gods people, who&s;e &s;ouls &s;eem to be at the very point of de&s;pair.</P>
<P N="1">1. The &s;tate of a godly man, and his future feli|city is not to be adjudged by the manner of his death, or his &s;en&s;ible comforts at the end of his days, but by the general cour&s;e and tendency of his life. A Ship that comes home richly laden may meet with a &s;torm at the Harbours mouth. <HI>It mat|ters not much</HI> (&s;aith Dr. <HI>Harris</HI> to his holy di&s;con&s;o|late wife,) <HI>whether comfort comes an hour before death, or an hour after death.</HI> A godly man may die mourn|ing; God may give him the Garment of gladne&s;s in Heaven, for his &s;pirit of heavine&s;s in Earth. A holy Mini&s;ter of this Nation was wont to &s;ay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>never tasted the &s;weet of Religion all his Life,</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ng A&s;&s;urance of Heaven.</P>
<P>Secondly, Believing doth precede &s;ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">g&punc; the direct act of Faith goes before the reflect act of Faith, the Faith of Adherence before the Faith of Evidence, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.13.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The Kingdom of Glory is not promi&s;ed to A&s;&s;urance, but to Faith and Repentance. There are many now in heaven that were not a&s;&s;ured of it
<PB N="60" REF="039482_0062_101426074BD86110">
till they come thither. And how many tender &s;e|rious &s;ouls are there who prize none in the World like a Chri&s;t, who love him with all the regards of the Lord, who hate the Enemies of his Scepter with a perfect hatred, who would not willingly offend or grieve him in the lea&s;t mea&s;ure, who cleave unto him as the only Rock of Salvation, who would not re|linqui&s;h their intere&s;t in him for Millions of Worlds. And yet they weep with <HI>Mary,</HI> becau&s;e they cannot &s;ee their Lord. They conflict with fears and doubts day and night, and have not that reflective Evidence and A&s;&s;urance that he is their Chri&s;t their God. The hour (&s;aid one) in which A&s;&s;urance comes is &s;el|dom, and its &s;tay is &s;hort. Tho&s;e that have it, have it not at all times; as there are degrees of Grace, &s;o there are different mea&s;ures of A&s;&s;urance. The Jewels of Grace may lie hid in the clo&s;e and dark Cabinet of the heart, until the Spirit &s;hine upon its own Grace, The choice&s;t Flowers have their Roots out of &s;ight. There are who be as truly in the favour of God, as the Angels them&s;elves, but they are very doubt|ful of it. 'Tis reported that two Mini&s;ters came to vi&s;it a godly woman, who was weeping over her Child in the Cradle: and being asked by one of the Mini&s;ters the cau&s;e of griefs, &s;he &s;aid, Becau&s;e I have profe&s;t Religion more than twenty years, and am not A&s;&s;ured of my Salvation. One of the Mini&s;ters asked the woman, Who&s;e child is this in the Cra|dle? &s;he an&s;wered, Mine, but &s;aid he, Doth the Chri&s;t know you are the Mother of it? She replied, No: which que&s;tion was a con&s;olation to this de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> woman. <HI>The Lord knoweth tho&s;e that are his.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, A man may come &s;afe to heaven without A&s;&s;urance, but not without Grace and inherent&punc; Ho|line&s;s. But remember this, the more carele&s;s and in|different a man or woman is about the a&s;&s;urance of Heaven, the further off he is from it. Therefore
<PB N="61" REF="039482_0063_1014260AA1A40F80">
prize it highly, pre&s;s after it vehemently, if thou would&s;t attain it.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Great ca&s;tings down, and &s;oul-di&s;tre&s;&s;es, do often u&s;her in much joy and inward peace. As a dark mi&s;ty Night goes before a bright Morning, and a cold long Winter before a Fruitful Spring. Some that have been brought down to the Valley of the &s;hadow of Death, have al&s;o been carried up to the Mount of Transfiguration. The Spirit of Bondage doth lead the way to the Spirit of Adoption, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. A Chri&s;tian that is poor and contrite in his own &s;en&s;e, may have his Soul in a pro&s;perous condition. And 'tis a great Faith to cleave to Chri&s;t and the Promi&s;es, when man hath little comfort. <HI>The time may come</HI> (&s;aith a great Divine) <HI>when the Faith of Adherence may be all in all.</HI> Tho' thy &s;oul is ca&s;t down, a&s;&s;urance may be at the door. When <HI>Mary Magdelen</HI> was weep|ing, and thought her Lord was ri&s;en and gone, Chri&s;t was behind her, <HI>Joh.</HI> 20.</P>
<P>Sixthly, Saints do not u&s;ually die in a Swoon or Spiritual Con&s;umption. If <HI>Eutichus</HI> fall down dead, he mu&s;t ri&s;e up again. So God will one way or o|ther recover his declining people, and revive his work in them, and make them ready. Con&s;ider, it greatly concerns all that will live and die comfortably, and enjoy Chri&s;t and Heaven Eternally, to pre&s;s after certainty, and to make ready. Are all our de&s;irable and be&s;t things in the world uncertain, and &s;hall our Souls and Heaven be &s;o too? In things of infinite le&s;s value, men are for certainty, and why not in this? The U&s;urer would have Money told twice, who was wont to &s;ay to his man, It is good to be &s;ure. In ca&s;e of Money lent, men will have double Security, by Bond and Land In <HI>London,</HI> there is an En&s;uring-Office for Merchandize. And will you have no care to pre&s;erve your Souls; If certainty of Salvation were to be bought, <HI>God knows, if I had ten Earths</HI> (&s;aid a very Holy and Learned Divine) <HI>I would part with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for it.</HI></P>

<P>To de&s;cend to Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. Tho&s;e that are gro&s;ly ignorant of God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> Ignorant of his Nature, Per|&s;on, Offices, they have neither a head or hearty knowledge of Chri&s;t.

<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t is, the cry or voice of the Spirit, which is a more &s;ecret and &s;till voice to excite us unto our duty. The Holy Gho&s;t &s;aith, <HI>To day, The Spirit &s;aith, Come, Rev. ult.</HI></P>

<P>The delay of the Bridegroom, is the time of re|pentance. There's not a Sabbath-day, nor a Sacra|ment-day, nor a Sermon-day, after the Judgment-day. Now God warns by his Judgments, waits to be gracious, calls by his Mini&s;ters, &s;trives by his Spirit: and you may be welcome to him. And upon your Repentance, and clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t, you &s;hall be ju&s;tified, pardoned, accepted, and taken into the Marriage, and Crowned: But &s;tay a little longer, and the Door is &s;hut, and then all your prayers, cryes, tears, will be fruitle&s;s, O &s;inner, ari&s;e; make ha&s;te and return unto the Lord before it be too late.</P>

Chri&s;tian, with greate&s;t care and con&s;cience practi&s;e the&s;e four duties to make ready for Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. With love and delight attend the Mini&s;try of the Word, wait on it, as the poor man at the Pool for healing, <HI>and &s;o hear that thy Soul may live. Mary</HI> attending upon the Word is commended by Chri&s;t. <HI>The Go&s;pel</HI> (&s;aith Dr. <HI>Sibs</HI>) <HI>is a Chariot to carry Christ up and down in the World</HI>; re&s;olve to follow this Chariot, be often under the Influences of Heaven, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s may let down his warm <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> upon you. The Spirit of God in the Mini|&s;try of the Word hath converted many a Soul, and prepared them for Heaven.</P>
<P>Secondly, Let the holy Sabbath or Lords day be always welcome to thee. <HI>How glad am I,</HI> &s;aid one, <HI>when I &s;ee the fir&s;t light of the Lords day</HI>: Inure thy &s;elf to the &s;trict Ob&s;ervation of that high and holy day of God, keep it as for thy life, that at the end of every Lords day, thou may&s;t be fit to enter upon an eternal Sabbath: how &s;ea&s;onable and &s;weet is it when Gods Spirit and our Hearts meet in the Duties we perform. <HI>I was in the Spirit,</HI> &s;aith <HI>John, on the Lords day.</HI></P>
<P>Three Duties in Religion are very hard, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. we watch the heart. 2. To pray without wan|dring
<PB N="109" REF="039482_0111_1014268F6154E9C8">
and di&s;traction; and 3. To keep the Lords Day well.</P>
<P N="3">3. Be frequent and affectionate in the celebration of that mo&s;t u&s;eful and glorious Ordinance the Lords Supper, by which we mu&s;t &s;hew forth the Lords death till he come. And if you would feed on, and fea&s;t with Chri&s;t in this ble&s;&s;ed Banquet, of which Chri&s;t is both the Ma&s;ter and the Matter, do three things: Fir&s;t, always come with due Pre|paration. Secondly, with high expectation. Thirdly, when come, make application.</P>
<P N="4">4. Be very &s;olemn and &s;erious in thy Clo&s;et-Vi&s;its, <HI>viz.</HI> be early and late with God by &s;ecret Prayer. The great <HI>Roman</HI> Captain <HI>Scipio,</HI> before he under|took any bu&s;ine&s;s, was wont fir&s;t to enter the Ca|pital, pretending a con&s;ulting with the gods; &s;everal Mini&s;ters being at Table where the Que&s;tion was asked, <HI>What was the be&s;t Trade</HI>? One an&s;wered, <HI>Begging,</HI> meaning Prayer. Would&s;t thou be pre|pared to go in with Chri&s;t, follow him with un|utterable groans from day to day for Grace, and fitne&s;s for Heaven, &s;peak out thine heart before God, as <HI>Hannah</HI> did when &s;he obtained a Son. The Voice is not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in Prayer, but the Heart: It matters not though the door of the Lips be &s;hut, &s;o the clo&s;et of the Heart be open. When thou art going into thy Chamber, or come into thy Clo&s;et to bow before the Lord, ob&s;erve the&s;e Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. Search and find out thine heart, and &s;ay, I am going about a great work, to beg Grace to prepare me for Heaven, Where art thou my heart?</P>
<P N="2">2. Summon in thine heart; 'tis often out of the way, &s;end a word of command after it, and fetch it in.</P>
<P N="3">3. Stir and lift up thine heart; the heart is like bell that will make no Mu&s;ick till it be rai&s;ed
<PB N="110" REF="039482_0112_1014269292032520">
up, like green Wood that will not burn without much blowing.</P>
<P N="4">4. Fix thy Heart on God to whom thou praye&s;t, and on Je&s;us Chri&s;t in who&s;e Name thou do&s;t it. Should a Man make a &s;uit to the King for his life, and not mind his bu&s;ine&s;s? The mo&s;t High looks upon the heart.</P>
<P N="5">5. Watch thine heart, and look for a return of thy Prayer, otherwi&s;e thine heart will give thee the &s;lip, and thy Prayer is lo&s;t. Prayer one com|pares to a Chain, one end of which is fa&s;tened to the Believers tongue, the other to Gods Ear, who is called, <HI>A God hearing Prayer.</HI> Say with <HI>Job, I will fill my mouth with Arguments.</HI> When <HI>David</HI> had taken good order for building the Temple, he directs his Prayer to God to prepare their hearts.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> had a cu&s;tom to ask nothing of their gods, but things of weight and moment. Is not this of greate&s;t concernment? Try what Prayer can do, plead before God by Ardent and Importunate Prayer to make thee ready, render thy &s;elf to God as an undone Creature to new mould, form and fa&s;hion thine Heart for him&s;elf; carry thy Heart to him on thy Knees, as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> brought the two Tables of Stone after the fir&s;t were bro|ken and defaced, for God to Write what he Will. Say Lord, I have heard what a di&s;mal, dark, dread|ful place Hell is, and what a ble&s;&s;ed and glorious place Heaven is, and yet I am not prepared for it. This heart of mine I have had on many a &s;ick-bed, and &s;entence of Death, and under many a Sermon, and &s;ometimes it hath been &s;tartled, and awakned, then I have purpo&s;ed and promi&s;ed to repent, pray, leave my &s;ins, to part with the World, and to be|come a new man, but I have acted the Hypocrite, all this is come to nothing; Lord do that in me and for me, which none but a God can do.</P>
<P>The bloody Child cannot beautifie and adorn

it &s;elf. The <HI>Ethiopian</HI> cannot change his Skin, nor the <HI>Leopard</HI> his Spots. The preparation of the heart in man is from the Lord. <HI>And I have cryed day &amp; night before thee,</HI> &s;aid <HI>David</HI>: 'Tis &s;toried of a Wo|man in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> after the Sentence was pa&s;t upon her, &s;he cryed &s;o earne&s;tly to the Judge for Mercy, that the Judge and Ju&s;tices rebuked her, to whom &s;he replied, <HI>I be&s;eech you my Lord, it is for my life.</HI> Chri&s;tian, 'tis for Heaven and the Eternal life of thy Soul, therefore be earne&s;t with God for his Spirit to &s;anctifie, and prepare thine heart, which by Nature, is a filthy polluted Ve&s;&s;el. God can make thine heart as &s;oft Wax, and &s;tamp his Image on it, but he will be &s;ought unto. The poor man cryed, and the Lord heard him, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 34 6. <HI>My Prayers</HI> (&s;aid <HI>Jonah) came in unto thee,</HI> Chap. 2.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

<P>THe fifth <HI>&V;&s;e</HI> is of Comfort, to tho&s;e who are prepared to go in with Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tian, why weepe&s;t thou? Why is thine Heart grieved? Why is thy Countenance &s;ad? Thou art to go in with Chri&s;t, <HI>where is fulne&s;s of Joy, and Plea&s;ures for evermore.</HI> Say, <HI>Why art thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t down, O my Soul?

<P>Fir&s;t, In general, You &s;hall go in from, and leave behind every thing that is afflictive and grievous to you. When <HI>Elijah</HI> went to Heaven,

he left his Mantle behind him. So when Chri|&s;tians go in with Chri&s;t, they &s;hall be perfectly and perpetually exempted from all Sinful and Penal Evils, both of Soul and Body.</P>
<P>Secondly, In particular,</P>
<P N="1">1. You &s;hall be freed from all the Defector Deformities, and Superfluities of the Body. There will be no Dim or Sore Eyes, no Feeble Knees, Trembling Hands, Bald Heads, Crooked Backs, Broken Bones; no Wens, Warts, Wounds, Can|cers, Fi&s;tulaes, Scars, or any Bodily Blemi&s;h.</P>
<P N="2">2. You &s;hall be Perfectly, and for ever free from all your Bodily Toil, Pain, Labour, with which the Lives of many of Gods People have been made bitter. Some to get a little bread have been labouring in the very Fire, others grind|ing at the Mill, &s;ome digging in the Mines, others ca&s;ting up of Ditches, &s;ome &s;pinning at the Tourn, others weaving at the Loom, &amp; thre&s;h|ing in the Barn, and carrying heavy Burdens, and many of them have been Servants to cruel hard Ma&s;ters, like <HI>I&s;rael</HI> under their Task-Ma&s;ters: This will be the Jubilee and Year of the Lords Relea&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. You &s;hall be freed from all your anxious, vexing and tormenting Cares and Perplexities, about your carnal and bad Relations, as Hus|bands, Wives, parents, Children, Friends, E&s;tates, Law-Suits, Debts, Ill-neighbours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. You &s;hall be freed from all your Sighs, Complaints, Groans, Ri&s;ing from within or from without. <HI>Abraham</HI> &s;hall no more complain for the want of an Heir, nor <HI>Rachel</HI> of her Barren|ne&s;s, nor <HI>Rebecca</HI> of the Daughters of <HI>Heth,</HI> nor <HI>Jacob</HI> of his lo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">&punc; <HI>David</HI> &s;hall not complain

of his treacherous familiar Friend, nor of his rebellious Son <HI>Ab&s;alom,</HI> or of being in the Tents of <HI>Kedar,</HI> the Song of the Drunkard, There &s;hall be no grieving Thorn, or pricking Briar, or a <HI>Canaanite</HI> in the Hou&s;e of the Lord, neither &s;hall they be &s;en&s;ible of Hunger, or Cold, or Naked|ne&s;s, any more for ever.</P>
<P N="5">5. You &s;hall be freed from all your Weakne&s;&s;es, Sickne&s;&s;es, and all Di&s;ea&s;es what&s;oever.

<P N="6">6. You &s;hall be freed from all your Pain and Travel, through Cold, Dirt, Winds, Storms, and other Difficulties, to come at the Word and Or|dinances of God, and from all your Deadne&s;s and Wearine&s;s in Duties, which is the grief and &s;or|row of your Souls.</P>
<P N="7">7. You &s;hall be perfectly freed from all your Fears, Corruptions, Temptations, De&s;ertions and Doubts, about your Souls and Heaven. The Spou&s;e will never &s;ay, Her Beloved is withdrawn and gone from her. <HI>Job</HI> &s;hall never feel the poi&s;oned Arrows within him more. <HI>David</HI> will never &s;ay, <HI>Save me, O Lord, for the Waters are come in upon my Soul: mine Eyes fail, while I wait for my God.</HI> The Believer &s;hall never be heard to &s;ay or wi&s;h, Oh! That I knew the work of Grace in me were true and &s;aving, that God's Heart were towards me, and that my Heart were truly &s;et on God. Then all their De&s;ires &s;hall be &s;atisfied, all their Fears removed, all their Doubts re&s;olved, all their Prayers fully an&s;wered,
<PB N="133" REF="039482_0135_10188080630CBB88">
and all their Graces perfected: and each Saint &s;hall come to the fulne&s;s of the Stature of the Gift of Chri&s;t. When <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was in the Mount, he came &s;hining down. Surely, the prepared Chri&s;tian &s;hall go &s;hining in, when clad with the Robe of Chri&s;ts Glorious Righteou&s;ne&s;s. The Bodies and Souls of Believers &s;hall be as <HI>Adam,</HI> when the Crown of Original Righteou&s;ne&s;s was &s;et upon his head: The Body will be in its per|fect &s;trength, and (as &s;ome think) as it was be|tween Thirty and Forty Years; and the Colours &s;o rare, fre&s;h, bright and tran&s;parent, that all the veins and nerves will be di&s;cerned, and &s;o full of &s;trength and agility, as it &s;hall be able (&s;aith <HI>Luther</HI>) to To&s;s the greate&s;t Mountain as a Ball.
