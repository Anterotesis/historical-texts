</ARGUMENT>
<P>ON my fir&s;t &s;etting out in life, I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no in|con&s;iderable &s;hare of what I &s;uppo&s;e is com|mon to all at the &s;ame age,&mdash;a high opinion of my own abilities. The world was new to me; I knew nothing of the difficulties I had to encounter in it, nor imagined there was to be found in it all a wi&s;er lad than my&s;elf. But time, and intercour&s;e with my own &s;pecies, have totally rever&s;ed my opinion; and taught me, that it requires a very large &s;hare of wi&s;|dom
<PB N="14" REF="035035_0007_0FFFF4EDDE1EE830">
to &s;teer through the tempe&s;tuous ocean of life with any tolerable degree of &s;afety; and no incon&s;ider|able degree of fortitude, to encounter the various evils to which human life is expo&s;ed. Of the&s;e propo|&s;itions the following &s;imple narrative will fully demon|&s;trate the truth.</P>
<P>I was born in <HI>Ayre&s;hire,</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> of re&s;pectable parents in their &s;tation, which was of the middle rank in &s;ociety. Having acquired an education &s;uitable to my years and expectations, I was given up by my fa|ther to a neighbouring &s;urgeon, who had taken a fancy to have me, at eleven years of age. My worthy ma&s;|ter, and all his family, gave me every indulgence my tender years required. Rigidly virtuous, and regular in his morals, my ma&s;ter took every opportunity of &s;ea|&s;oning my young mind with the be&s;t advice, and of in|&s;tructing me in every religious and moral obligation. Both he and my good old mi&s;tre&s;s, often expre&s;&s;ed their delight at &s;eeing the attention and re&s;pect I paid to their injunctions; and in order to pre&s;erve me from the contagion of vice, and keep me under their own eye, they con&s;tantly took me along with them wherever they went.</P>
<P>It was the intention of my ma&s;ter to in&s;truct me in his own profe&s;&s;ion, and happy had it been for me if I had been ruled by his advice. But I had got an ear|ly bias for a &s;ea faring life, and the more than parent|al
<PB N="15" REF="035035_0008_0FFFF4EF8338A178">
kindne&s;s of my ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s was totally lo&s;t upon me; for while they made it their daily &s;tudy to promote my happine&s;s at home, I was eagerly watch|ing every opportunity of di&s;engaging my&s;elf from a yoke, which to me &s;eemed intolerable. A mind de|termined will &s;eldom be long at a lo&s;s for an excu&s;e. A &s;light quarrel with my ma&s;ter's &s;on effected my pur|po&s;e; and though the blame was wholly on my &s;ide, I told him, I never would &s;tay another day in his father's hou&s;e. The young man reported this to his mother, who in&s;tantly &s;ent for me, and in the mo&s;t earne&s;t lan|guage, laid before me the hard&s;hip and danger of a &s;ea|faring life: and often, when I have thought of her kind remon&s;trances, have I regretted the fatality, that they &s;hould have only &s;erved to confirm me the more in my re&s;olution. Taking therefore a ha&s;ty leave of this good family, I paid a vi&s;it to my father, who, though much enraged at the part I had acted, was, in a few days, prevailed on to rig me out after the manner I wi&s;hed: and as I &s;till dreaded a more &s;erious oppo&s;ition to my favourite &s;cheme from my parents, than I had met with from my ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s, I &s;et out one morn|ing before the family were out of bed, for <HI>Por<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Gla&s;|gow;</HI> where I under&s;tood there was no dange<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of be|ing long at a lo&s;s for want of employment. A &s;on-in-law of the doctor's, my late ma&s;ter, was the only ac|quaintance I had in the town; and as he was the own|er of &s;everal &s;hips in the We&s;t-India trade, I thought him the mo&s;t likely per&s;on to whom I could apply. He
<PB N="16" REF="035035_0009_0FFFF4F5694D0368">
eagerly embraced my offer, as at that time they were much at a lo&s;s for hands, and de&s;ired me to lodge at his hou&s;e for a few days, till &s;ome of his ve&s;&s;els return|ed, and I &s;hould go in the fir&s;t that came. I in&s;tantly wrote to my father, informing him of every thing that had pa&s;&s;ed; who &s;eeing no better could be done, &s;ent me my clothes, and &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries as he judged pro|per for my new occupation.</P>
<P>Next day my indentures were made out; and in fourteen days a ve&s;&s;el arrived. Never did the heart of a bridegroom exult more on the morning of his nup|tials, than did mine at the &s;ight of a fine large &s;hip, in which I was to make my fir&s;t voyage to &s;ea. The world I had left behind me never co&s;t me a &s;igh; the wooden world was all to me: But alas! I had not yet &s;een the dark &s;ide of the picture. Few repairs were ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and in a &s;hort time we began to take in our loading for the We&s;t-Indies, where we were to di&s;po&s;e of it in the i&s;lands of Barbadoes, Antigua, and St. Kitts. On the fir&s;t of May we completed our cargo, and on the 10th of the &s;ame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onth, 1781, we weighed anchor. Our crew con&s;i&s;ted of forty men, be&s;ides fifteen pa&s;&s;engers of both &s;exes; among the latter was a Mrs. Murray, of a remarkable &s;ize: &s;he had lived the greater part of her time in the We&s;t-Indies; but the warm climate &s;o far from reducing her to a &s;keleton, as is the ca&s;e with many Europeans, &s;eemed to have agreed very well with her, as &s;he mea&s;ured in height five feet five in|ches,
<PB N="17" REF="035035_0010_0FFFF4F6F10CEA50">
and round the &s;malle&s;t part of the wai&s;t, &s;ix feet and an half. When the boat that brought her came along &s;ide, &s;he called out to the mate, in a voice like thunder, de&s;iring him to be &s;ure every thing was right, and the tackles &s;trong enough to hoi&s;t on board twenty-two &s;tone, as that &s;he &s;aid, was her neat weight two days ago. It required &s;ome &s;trength to hoi&s;t her on board; but the difficulty did not end here, for upon my &s;hewing her the room appropriated for her, &s;he could not, with all her art, get her&s;elf &s;queezed in at the door, till the carpenter was obliged to widen it. There was likewi&s;e a young pa&s;&s;enger of the name of <HI>Kemp,</HI> who had been bred a weaver, but had given up his loom with an inten|tion of pu&s;hing his fortune in the We&s;t-Indies, as a clerk. This young adventurer, from a total ignorance of the world, added to an ardent de&s;ire to appear a gentleman, furni&s;hed the crew and pa&s;&s;engers with daily entertain|ment, during the whole voyage.</P>
<P>At the mouth of the Clyde, lies the rock of Ilay, remarkable for the va&s;t number of &s;olan gee&s;e, and other &s;ea-fowls, which continually re&s;ort to it. A propo&s;al was made by the captain to &s;end the boat on &s;hore, as the weather was moderate; and &s;everal of the hands arming them&s;elves with mu&s;kets, Mr. Kemp enquired into the bu&s;ine&s;s. The captain pointed out the rock, telling him, it was a de&s;ert uninhabited i&s;land, where lions and tygers abounded in great numbers; and that if he had courage for an attack, he would furni&s;h
<PB N="18" REF="035035_0011_0FFFF4F879F6BEC0">
him with a gun. Accordingly he put into his hands an old ru&s;ty mu&s;ket, bayonet, and hanger, and on his head a grenadier's cap; he likewi&s;e advi&s;ed him to exchange cloaths with &s;ome of the &s;ailors, as the &s;ight of a &s;ailor's dre&s;s, he &s;aid, would fright the mo&s;t ferocious wild bea&s;t in the world. Thus accoutred, Mr. Kemp joined the party that were going a&s;hore, declaring him&s;elf ready to attack the fir&s;t wild bea&s;t that came in his way. The &s;ailors began on their pa&s;&s;age a&s;hore, to propo&s;e bets who &s;hould kill the fir&s;t game. Mr. Kemp immediately ac|cepted a wager of half a guinea, that the fir&s;t &s;hould be killed by him&s;elf: but upon loading their pieces, Mr. Kemp, for the fir&s;t time, made the di&s;covery that his gun wanted a lock; he therefore in&s;i&s;ted the bet &s;hould be drawn; but the captain willing to entertain him&s;elf a little longer at his expence, accommodated him with his own. The fir&s;t object that pre&s;ented our adventurers upon their landing, was a few &s;heep, which the captain per&s;uaded the credulous pa&s;&s;enger, were &s;o many white boars. Kemp creeping upon his knees till he got within gun-&s;hot of them, let fly among them; the affrighted &s;heep fled at the report of the gun, but one of them be|ing a little lame, could not run &s;o fa&s;t as the re&s;t: Our &s;port&s;man called out with great &s;elf-compla&s;ency, that he had got the wager, as he had hit one of the boars. His companions, after indulging the laugh at his expence, told him that his game was no other than a &s;heep. "But," &s;ays the captain, "if you will go to the top of the rock you will find plenty of game," and at the &s;ame time
<PB N="19" REF="035035_0012_0FFFF4FA1E0E2B08">
pointing out the neare&s;t road to him. The credulous young man mounted the rock, but no &s;ooner was he got out of fight, than his companions made off in the boat, and left him to find game as he could. Upon mi&s;&s;ing the boat, he fell into a &s;tate little &s;hort of di&s;traction: nor did the captain for &s;ome hours, think proper to relieve him; and when he ordered the boat a&s;hore for him, the &s;ai|lors found him &s;itting on the rock in a &s;tate of ab&s;olute de&s;pair. After he got on board, the wind &s;pringing up from the &s;outhward, we intended going out of the North channel, and this we rather would do, as there was le&s;s likelihood of meeting with any of the enemies' &s;hips. I need not inform my reader, that at this period, Great Britain was engaged in a war with America, and three of the greate&s;t maritime powers in the world.</P>
<P>May 15th, at 3 o'clock, A. M. we di&s;covered a ve&s;|&s;el crowding all the &s;ail &s;he could to come up to us. All hands were in&s;tantly called; the decks were cleared; mu&s;kets put into the hands of the pa&s;&s;engers, and every thing ready for an engagement; but about 8 o'clock &s;he hailed us, when we di&s;covered her to be the Hinde &s;loop of war, then &s;tationed in that channel. The wind blowing &s;omewhat fre&s;h, we parted, and proceeded on our voyage. The weather for &s;ome days continuing favourable, and every thing &s;ucceeding to our wi&s;hes, our captain returned to the malicious amu&s;ement of roa&s;ting Mr. Kemp. He had ob&s;erved this young ad|venturer pay much more attention to his dre&s;s, and
<PB N="20" REF="035035_0013_0FFFF4FED3198E90">
wa&s;h him&s;elf more frequently than is commonly done at &s;ea; and one day he told him, he would furni&s;h him with a wa&s;h for his face and hands, that would totally take away the appearance of the mechanic, and give his &s;kin a &s;moothne&s;s and delicacy equal to any lady's. As nothing was more agreeable to Mr. Kemp than the pro&s;|pect of a gentleman-like appearance when he got to the We&s;t-Indies, he loaded the captain with a profu&s;ion of thanks, and told him he could not do him a greater favour. I was ordered to prepare the wa&s;h; which was a panful of oatmeal and water, mixed without &s;alt, which, when going to bed, he was to &s;pread upon his handker|chief and apply to his face; and fill his &s;tockings, into which he was to put his hands, and in that manner to &s;leep all night. Kemp begged my a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the ap|plication of it, and went to bed in high &s;pirits, expecting to appear an <HI>Adonis</HI> in the morning. Next day the cap|tain had prepared the company for his appearance, and as he had not been &s;een till the whole of the pa&s;&s;engers were a&s;&s;embled to breakfa&s;t, I was ordered to call him. He in&s;tantly obeyed the &s;ummons, and placing him&s;elf at the table, pre&s;ented to the company the appearance of an old man of ninety, or an hundred. The applica|tion of the poultice had contracted the &s;kin, and pur&s;ed it to &s;uch a degree, that it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for any of his over-night acquaintances to recollect the &s;malle&s;t traces of his former face. The laugh again&s;t him was long and loud, without his being able to di&s;co|ver the cau&s;e, till ri&s;ing from the table, and applying to
<PB N="21" REF="035035_0014_0FFFF5025D9A5A98">
a looking gla&s;s, it pre&s;ented to him a hideous form with which he had not the &s;lighte&s;t acquaintance. Enraged to the highe&s;t degree at the lo&s;s of his beauty, he began in the bittere&s;t terms to revile the captain; &s;wearing, he would make him pay dearly for his u&s;age on their arri|val at Barbadoes. He then went upon deck, a&s;king every one he met, if they knew any method of re&s;tor|ing him to his natural complexion: One of the &s;ailors, who was as much the wag as the captain, told him, he knew of an infallible method; and gathering up a kind of blob, common in tho&s;e &s;eas, known to the &s;ailors by the name of the <HI>Portugue&s;e-man-of-war,</HI> de&s;ired Mr. Kemp to rub his face with it. The poor &s;impleton took his advice, and immediately his face was all over in a flame. This drove poor Kemp almo&s;t to di&s;traction; but as the laugh, at his expence, had been general all over the &s;hip, and no means of revenge occurring to him, he re|tired, &s;ullen and di&s;gu&s;ted, to indulge his private thoughts in his own apartment. In this manner our time pa&s;&s;ed, our captain ever fertile in expedients, to entertain one part of his pa&s;&s;engers at the expence of another.</P>
<P>The day at la&s;t arrived when we were to cro&s;s the line, and as this day is &s;pent, time immemorial, in a &s;pecies of humour peculiar to a &s;ea-faring life, I &s;hall give a &s;hort account of it, for the benefit of tho&s;e who never were at &s;ea. The great bug-bear of the ocean is <HI>Davie Jones.</HI> Whence this old gentleman had his origin, I cannot certainly &s;ay. It mu&s;t be granted, that we &s;ons
<PB N="22" REF="035035_0015_0FFFF504E9103CD0">
of Neptune have no incon&s;iderable &s;hare either of &s;uper|&s;tition or credulity; and it is mo&s;t probable one or both had the principal hand in bringing him into exi&s;tence. However that may be, at the cro&s;&s;ing of the line, he has often been found an exi&s;tence not merely ideal. The day before, great preparations are made for pa&s;&s;ing this old gentleman in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful manner. Mats, &s;wabs, &s;kins, or whatever comes fir&s;t to hand of dark co|lour, are laid in readine&s;s to dock out two of the &s;ailors, who are to repre&s;ent him and his wife, who mu&s;t be pre&s;ent on the occa&s;ion. The pa&s;&s;engers are, if po&s;&s;ible, kept below at the approach of the &s;uppo&s;ed boat, when the farce is to be acted; and when every thing is in readine&s;s, one of the hands runs up and down the deck making a great noi&s;e with a trumpet, and calling out, that Davie Jones and his wife are coming on board, and that every thing mu&s;t be made ready for their re|ception. Every pa&s;&s;enger, who knows no better, is made to believe that this good old couple keep a kind of turnpike-gate here, which it impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s with|out paying &s;omething to &s;ecure their friend&s;hip. Pa&s;|&s;engers, or &s;ailors, who can afford it, pay a &s;mall ran|&s;om and are free; but &s;uch as will not, undergo a very rigid di&s;cipline. They are fir&s;t of all brought upon the deck blindfolded, then led to a large tub full of water, acro&s;s which is placed a &s;tick, upon which they are for|ced to &s;it down. Old Davie then makes his appearance in the character of a barber, a tub being placed by his &s;ide full of tar, grea&s;e, and lampblack, into which he
<PB N="23" REF="035035_0016_0FFFF506744F28B8">
dips a bru&s;h, and with this compound lathers the face of the unfortunate pa&s;&s;enger, and then proceeds to apply a razor to his face, which is generally a piece of an old hoop, or &s;ome ru&s;ty iron. The devil is &s;aid once to have &s;haved a pig, and after the operation, to have ob&s;erved, there was <HI>more moi&s;e than wool.</HI> So it generally force with old Davie, and tho&s;e upon whom his operations are performed. My reader will ea&s;ily conceive the wry faces, and horrid exclamations made on this occa&s;ion. After the &s;having operation is over, it is nece&s;&s;ary to wa&s;h them, and for this purpo&s;e, the &s;tick upon which they &s;at is pulled away, the con&s;equence of which is, they are &s;ou&s;ed over head and ears into the tub of water over which they were placed, and immediately a &s;cramble takes place for all the water on deck, every one throw|ing as much as he can upon his neighbour, till all are completely drenched; and the bu&s;ine&s;s ends in a hearty cann of grog. Such has heretofore been the manner of cro&s;&s;ing the line.</P>
<P>The bad con&s;equences, however, attending this rough procedure, pa&s;&s;engers &s;ometimes &s;uffering &s;evere|ly in the experiment, has of late years, made the captains of &s;hips di&s;courage this &s;pecies of humour; and the fine of half a crown, or even a &s;hilling, is now deemed &s;uffi|cient for Davie and his wife, without having recour&s;e to the &s;having operation at all. On the 22d of June, in the morning, we made the i&s;land of Barbadoes; but were under the greate&s;t apprehen&s;ions about landlag, as
<PB N="24" REF="035035_0017_0FFFF5090A25D6E0">
a number of war-&s;hips were lying in Carli&s;le-bay, and we were afraid of having our men pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;er|vice. Our fears were not groundle&s;s. The fleet lying here, con&s;i&s;ted of twenty-&s;ix &s;ail of the line, which in a few days expected to attack the French fleet then lying at Dominica, and hands were much wanted. From one of the &s;hips we were &s;aluted by a gun, and ordered to come to anchor; which we had no &s;ooner done, than we were boarded by all the boats belonging to the fleet; every one &s;triving who &s;hould get mo&s;t of our men. They took from us nine, and departed, leav|ing us barely as many as were &s;ufficient to navigate the &s;hip. Next day we put a&s;hore our pa&s;&s;engers, and begun to unload &s;o much of our cargo as was configned to this i&s;land, which we accompli&s;hed in &s;ix days. Barbadoes is the mo&s;t ea&s;terly of all our We&s;t-India i&s;lands, lying in 59 degrees we&s;t longitude, and 13 degrees north latitude. It is about 21 miles long, and 14 broad. The capital of the i&s;land is Bridgetown, &s;ituated at the head of Carli&s;le-bay. Here the governor re&s;ides. The bay will contain a very great number of &s;hips, which can anchor in from ten to thirty fathoms water, and a tolera|ble bottom. Two large fortre&s;&s;es command the harbour. The i&s;land produces &s;ugar, cotton, and coffee. They ex|port likewi&s;e large quantities of rum; though it is con|&s;iderably inferior to that of Jamaica, or even of Antigua. The climate is healthy; and the native of Britain, of which a con&s;iderable number are &s;ettled here, &s;eem to be lively, active, and happy.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="035035_0018_0FFFF50D9BF7E598">A fleet being preparing at this place to &s;ail to the leeward, we made all imaginable ha&s;te for the benefit of their convoy; and on the fir&s;t of July, every thing being in readine&s;s, we &s;et &s;ail for Antigua, being in all thirty merchant &s;hips, under convoy of the Boreas, Sable, and La-fortune frigates. The fifth of July we parted from our convoy, their de&s;tination being for St. Lucia, and on the &s;ixth we made the i&s;land of Antigua.</P>
<P>This i&s;land is &s;ituated in 60 degrees we&s;t longitude, and 17 degrees north latitude. It is of a circular form, being nearly 20 miles in diameter, and the country ra|ther mountainous, though the &s;oil is in general very good. It produces &s;ugar, cotton, and coffee, and on the i&s;land a con&s;iderable quantity of rum is made, but a little inferior to that of Jamaica. The climate is healthy, and the inhabitants, in general, live to an old age. The negroes, of which there are a great number, appear hap|py, notwith&s;tanding the wretchedne&s;s of their condition. They are, in general, allowed a &s;mall lot of ground, and have one day in the week, namely Sunday, for its culti|vation, and their ma&s;ters &s;ometimes indulge them with a &s;mall mor&s;el of pork, or a &s;alt herring, but the&s;e are luxuries they are not every day accu&s;tomed to.</P>
<P>Engli&s;h Harbour, &s;ituated on the &s;outh &s;ide of the i&s;land, is well adapted for the accommodation of &s;hips of war for repairing; but St. John's is the capital for trade. There is only another &s;mall harbour, on the north-ea&s;t
<PB N="26" REF="035035_0019_0FFFF50F25E96DD8">
&s;ide of the i&s;land, called Param: but as the entrance is dangerous and difficult, few &s;hips of any con&s;iderable burden attempt it, but commonly &s;end their boats for what loading they take in there. This i&s;land is gene|rally kept in an excellent &s;tate of defence; and in time of war, when the alarm is made, every fortification can be in readine&s;s in the &s;pace of an hour. The greate&s;t difficulty under which the inhabitants of Antigua labour, is a &s;carcity of water: there is not a &s;pring upon the i&s;land, the only &s;upply therefore they have, comes im|mediately from the clouds.</P>
<P>On the twenty-&s;eventh of July we weighed anchor, and on the twenty-ninth we made St. Kitts, or St. Chri&s;topher's, &s;o called from the famous Cri&s;topher Columbus, who fir&s;t di&s;covered it. This i&s;land is &s;itu|ated in 62 degrees we&s;t longitude, and 17 degrees north latitude. It is about fourteen or fifteen leagues di&s;tant from Antigua, and is twenty miles long, and nine broad: the we&s;t end of the i&s;land is very mountain|ous, and the woods abound with va&s;t numbers of apes and monkies, which the negroes lay hold of very rea|dily, by the following &s;tratagem:&mdash;They have cocoa|nut &s;hells prepared on purpo&s;e, with a hole in each, &s;o large as to admit the paw of the animal: into the &s;hell they put a lump of &s;ugar, of which the monkey tribe are &s;o exceedingly fond, that when they once di&s;|cover their prize, they make various efforts to get it out, and will &s;ooner allow them&s;elves to be taken, than
<PB N="27" REF="035035_0020_0FFFF510AD5EE228">
leave it before they made good their purpo&s;e. For a monkey or baboon &s;ome of the &s;ailors will perhaps give a bottle of rum, or &s;omething of equal value, and this a negro deems an ample compen&s;ation.</P>
<P>If no men of war are in the harbour here, the &s;tron|ge&s;t of the merchant &s;hips generally lies guard. On the twentieth of September it was our turn, when we di&s;|covered to the we&s;tward a brig, which we &s;u&s;pected to be French, or American, wanting to cut &s;ome of the fleet out of the harbour. Having alarmed the fleet, we lay that night upon our guard, bringing on board a number of men out of the &s;maller ve&s;&s;els that lay to the &s;hore of us. About twelve o'clock at night &s;he en|tered the harbour, when we di&s;covered her to be a &s;loop of war, belonging to Britain. Her lieutenant came on board our &s;hip, and reque&s;ted the favour of our boat for a few hours, to go through the other &s;hips with a view of impre&s;&s;ing men, a&s;&s;uring our captain at the &s;ame time, he would take none of his. This was readily granted, and in a &s;hort time he returned with about forty-men, after which they immediately left the harbour. There are in St. Chri&s;topher's &s;everal harbours, but the mo&s;t commodious for trade is Ba&s;&s;a|terre, in which we now lay. Notwith&s;tanding this harbour is the mo&s;t frequented, it is very inconvenient for loading and unloading: a continual &s;urf, or &s;well, making it very un&s;afe, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, to venture a&s;hore. The negroes, however, who are by no means
<PB N="28" REF="035035_0021_0FFFF5144713B0F8">
afraid of dying by water, perform, upon the&s;e occa|&s;ions, what would be very difficult to any other per&s;on. They are very dextrous in the management of their canoes, which though &s;o &s;mall as to contain only one hog&s;head or two puncheons, will live almo&s;t in any &s;ea. When they get them a&s;hore, a number of them &s;eize upon them, and haul them out of the way of the &s;urf, where they take in their loading, and wait the &s;mooth|ing of the &s;ea; and the moment they have a proper opportunity, they all join in pu&s;hing them into the wa|ter. Each canoe is manned by two negroes, who, in an in&s;tant leap on board of her, and proceed to what|ever &s;hip they are de&s;tined.</P>
<P>On the twenty-eighth of September we &s;ailed from St. Kitts, and proceeded to the northward, with a brig under our convoy. We &s;et out with a very fine breeze, which carried us acro&s;s the Trades, but which was &s;uc|ceeded by a violent gale of wind, in latitude 29&deg; longitude 50&deg;, which greatly di&s;abled us: in the cour&s;e of the gale we had parted from the brig, and did not &s;ee her till the &s;econd day after.</P>
<P>On the 25th of October, in the morning, we de&s;|cried two brigs &s;tanding to the &s;outhward, and we &s;oon found them to be Americans, and entertained the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes of making them prizes. We fired a gun at the fir&s;t, which &s;he not &s;eeming to mind, we gave her a broad&s;ide at once, upon which &s;he hoi&s;ted an
<PB N="29" REF="035035_0022_0FFFF515CE5261C0">
American flag. We made a &s;ignal for our brig to cut her off, and were preparing to give chace to the other; but in&s;tead of ob&s;erving our &s;ignal &s;he &s;till kept under our &s;tern: &s;eeing this, we in&s;tantly put about, but a &s;hort chace &s;oon convinced us, that we were by no means a match for the enemy at &s;ailing, and by the ob&s;tinacy of the brig, we lo&s;t both our expected prizes.</P>
<P>When we found this we &s;tood on our cour&s;e, and the wind being fair for a few days, we expected to make our port without any further interruption. But on the &s;econd of November, we were overtaken by a very heavy gale of wind, which obliged us to heave our &s;hip, as we could no longer carry any &s;ail. In this con|dition we lay for the &s;pace of fourteen days, the wind con&s;tantly blowing from the north we&s;t. The &s;ixth day after the gale came on, our captain judged it proper to put us all upon &s;hort allowance, as there were on board &s;ixty two per&s;ons, and but a very moderate quantity ei|ther of water or provi&s;ions. Our &s;hip's company was made up of men from different nations; among others we had eight Dutchmen, who di&s;liking the allowance a&s;|&s;igned them, determined upon rai&s;ing a mutiny; and in all probability would have effected their purpo&s;e, had they not been detected by a &s;oldier who was our pa&s;&s;en|ger, and who over-heard the whole of their plot. They had determined fir&s;t to make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the arms which were on the quarter deck, after which they were to proceed to the cabin, and murder all who would
<PB N="30" REF="035035_0023_0FFFF51755DE7708">
not join their party; then they were to &s;eize upon the &s;hip, and ran her into the fir&s;t American port. The &s;oldier who over-heard them, took the fir&s;t private op|portunity of reporting what he had heard. The captain was determined to try them to the la&s;t, and at the &s;ame time to take &s;uch precautions as &s;hould prevent the ef|fects they intended. When night came on, he had the re&s;t of the hands di&s;po&s;ed of in &s;uch a manner as to &s;e|cure them with the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible ca&s;e. The hour ar|rived when their operations were to commence, when proceeding to the arm che&s;t they found it empty, and going down to the cabin, the men who were waiting to give them a proper reception, &s;eized upon them and brought them upon deck. They were chained two by two for the &s;pace of &s;even days; but being unable to work our &s;hip without their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, we were at la&s;t obliged to relea&s;e &s;ix, leaving the two ring-leaders, to &s;uffer a puni&s;hment little &s;hort of death: for &s;o incle|ment was the &s;ea&s;on, that any water that happened to wa&s;h the deck, was ice in a moment. Our captain, of who&s;e barbarity and inhumanity every day brought fre&s;h in&s;tances, would not, during the &s;pace of fourteen days, allow them to change their cloaths, though they were often drenched over head and ears: but I &s;hall have occa&s;ion &s;oon to mention other in&s;tances of his cruelty, and &s;hall for the pre&s;ent proceed with my narrative.</P>
<P>On the twenty-&s;econd of November we were cha&s;ed by a large Dutch-built &s;hip, which appeared to be com|ing
<PB N="31" REF="035035_0024_0FFFF51BF6D71BB8">
up to us very fa&s;t. At the &s;ight of her, the eyes of the two Dutchmen chained to the fore-ca&s;tle, &s;parkled with joy. Upon this occa&s;ion however their a&s;&s;i&s;tance was wanted, and our captain very <HI>generou&s;ly</HI> &s;et them at liberty. The pa&s;&s;engers were all furni&s;hed with &s;mall arms, and every man ordered to his po&s;t. At this time I acted in the capacity of cabin-boy, and the captain cal|ling to me to bring him a &s;peaking trumpet, in the tre|pidation and hurry I was in, I unluckily appeared in his pre&s;ence without remembering to pull on my cap; but he &s;oon gave me rea&s;on to repent my forgetfulne&s;s, by dealing me a few hearty blows, which cut me mo&s;t un|mercifully, and laid me almo&s;t &s;peechle&s;s at his feet. After the &s;hip that had &s;o alarmed us came up, &s;he prov|ed to be a Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;el from New-York, bound to the We&s;t-Indies. After di&s;cour&s;ing with one another for a little, we parted, wi&s;hing each other a good pa&s;&s;age. We directed our cour&s;e for the port of New-York, whither we were bound; and having a bri&s;k gale, on the twenty-fifth of November, we di&s;covered land, which proved to be <HI>Never Sink;</HI> but night coming on, obliged us to heave too, till the morning of the following day, when we found our&s;elves in le&s;s than ten fathoms water, but the wind abating and veering to the north-we&s;t, we then came to anchor, to prevent our being drove farther off the &s;hore. On the twenty-&s;eventh, at four o'clock, A. M. four men of war &s;hips coming out of the harbour, one of them made right to us; and making a demand of men, our captain delivered up the whole of the Dutchmen con|cerned
<PB N="42" REF="035035_0025_0FFFF51D826A5110">
in the late plot. But this not &s;atisfying the lieu|tenant, who had boarded us, he took &s;o many of our o|ther hands, as rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for us to navigate the &s;hip into port. The captain found it nece&s;&s;ary to apply to the commodore, who ordered the &s;ame &s;hip to &s;end men to conduct us; the lieutenant quarter ma&s;ter, and &s;ixteen hands therefore coming on board, took the command of our &s;hip, and on the morning of the twenty-eighth brought us &s;afe into Sandy Hook. The men how|ever, willing to indemnify them&s;elves for their trouble, had, in the cour&s;e of the &s;even or eight hours they were on board of us, made free with twelve ca&s;es of our gin. When they were about to leave us, the lieutenant, to whom I had rendered &s;ome little menial &s;ervices, ex|pre&s;&s;ed an intention of taking me along with him; but the captain, who was unwilling to part with me, offered him another in my &s;tead. We were all obliged to range our&s;elves on the deck, when the lieutenant made choice of a boy who had been in the &s;ervice before, and to our great &s;atisfaction bade us adieu.</P>
<P>On the twenty-ninth we weighed anchor and &s;tood for New-York; but as the ice in large quantities was coming down the river, we were obliged to bring to an|chor again till the tide flowed, when we expected to meet with le&s;s oppo&s;ition. Next morning at two o'clock we again weighed anchor, and at four, A. M. we arrived at the port.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="035035_0026_0FFFF5200E3D1C70">A few days after our arrival, die brig we parted with at &s;ea, arrived al&s;o, in a very leaky &s;hattered condition, having lo&s;t a part of her &s;ails, one of her ma&s;ts, and part of her rigging. There was at this time a very great demand for our cargo, and we began to unload with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed.</P>
<P>As the city of New-York &s;tands at the mouth of Hud|&s;on's river, its &s;ituation for trade is admirable; a com|munication is thereby opened with Albany, and many other inland towns towards Canada, and the Lakes; and as the conveyance is &s;o commodious and ea&s;y for all &s;ort of goods, the quantities that pa&s;s through this city, are immen&s;e. The hou&s;es, in general, are elegant; and the city, though irregularly built, forms a beautiful pro&s;|pect from the river. The export trade of New-York, con&s;i&s;ts of wheat, flour, &s;kins, and furs, and a variety of other articles. Its markets are well &s;upplied, as it has in all &s;ea&s;ons of the year, a &s;hort and ea&s;y pa&s;&s;age to the ocean; and commands the inland trade of a great proportion of the be&s;t &s;ettled, and be&s;t cultivated part of the United States. Hud&s;on's river is navigable for ve&s;&s;els of 80 tons, as far up as Albany, which is one hundred and &s;ixty miles north of New-York; and for &s;hips of any &s;ize to Hud&s;on, which is about one hundred and thirty miles. To a per&s;on fond of angling, a &s;ail up this river affords excellent pa&s;t time. In the Mohawk river, which emp|ties into the Hud&s;on, there is a large cataract, where the water falls thirty feet perpendicular; but including
<PB N="34" REF="035035_0027_0FFFF521972235F0">
the de&s;cent above the fall, &s;ixty or &s;eventy feet. The rock over which the water pours, extends almo&s;t in a line acro&s;s the river.&mdash;But I return to my narrative, hoping the reader will excu&s;e this digre&s;&s;ion re&s;pecting a country for which I entertain the greate&s;t partiality.</P>
<P>Before we left the harbour of New-York, our cap|tain ordered me one day to have an hundred oy&s;ters ready for him by nine o'clock in the evening. I took care to have every thing ready at the appointed hour, when he entered, handing into the cabin two ladies of the <HI>Cyprean corps,</HI> who without any ceremony &s;at down with him to &s;upper. During their repa&s;t, he ordered me to bring him a pair of candle-&s;nuffers: I went to find them, but not immediately &s;ucceeding, he took his watch out of his pocket, and &s;wore a mo&s;t tremendous oath, that if I did not bring them in five minutes, he would &s;hoot me dead on the &s;pot. Still I continued my &s;earch, and the time expired without my being able to find then. He in&s;tantly &s;eized me, and leading me to one &s;ide of the cabin, ordered me to &s;trip. I was un|der the hard nece&s;&s;ity to comply, and fixing me to a ring, drove into one of the beams, he gave me a flog|ging, which had nearly deprived me of life: after|wards he drew me upon deck, naked as I was, where he left me in a very inclement &s;ea&s;on, in a &s;tate which I am unable to de&s;cribe. In this &s;tate I was forced to re|main for two full hours, when the captain's voice again &s;truck horror to my heart. With many horrid oaths
<PB N="35" REF="035035_0028_0FFFF526274B8A30">
and imprecations, he ordered me down to the cabin, threatening to to&s;s me overboard if I did not immedi|ately obey. This however was not in my power; the &s;tripes he had given me, and the exce&s;&s;ive cold, had al|mo&s;t deprived me of &s;en&s;e and motion. My tyrant was not yet &s;atisfied, but coming upon deck, found me out, and kicked me from one end of it to the other with his feet. The noi&s;e brought all hands upon deck; but though every one pitied me, no one dur&s;t interpo&s;e, well knowing if they did, he would &s;oon &s;end them on board a man of war. At la&s;t, having glutted his re|venge, he pulled me upon my legs, and giving me a quarter-dollar, ordered me to go on &s;hore and buy him a pair of &s;nuffers. Glad to be relieved on any terms from his barbarity, I made every exertion my little re|maining &s;trength would admit of, and got a&s;hore, re|&s;olving to &s;ee him no more: but alas! I was a &s;tranger, without money or friends, and at &s;o late an hour, no hou&s;e would admit me, &s;o that I had no alternative but to return to the &s;hip. A man in the &s;treet directed me to a brazier's, and having purcha&s;ed a pair of &s;nuf|fers, I once more went on board, firmly determined to make my e&s;cape in the morning.</P>
<P>By the time I returned, the ladies propo&s;ed taking their departure, when I was ordered to &s;et them a&s;hore, after which I retired to my hammock, with a brui&s;ed body and aching heart. Next morning I took the ear|lie&s;t opportunity of going a&s;hore, and getting on board
<PB N="36" REF="035035_0029_0FFFF528B5A4DD48">
a &s;hip where I had &s;everal acquaintances, pa&s;&s;ed that day and the next night with them; but I had left my cloaths, and &s;everal articles on board my own &s;hip, which I was unwilling to lo&s;e, and I could devi&s;e no method of re|covering them without returning my&s;elf. I was in hopes of obtaining my object without the knowledge of the captain, but one of the men &s;u&s;pecting my intentions, would not permit my going a&s;hore again; and the cap|tain over-hearing our altercation, ordered me in&s;tantly into the cabin; he a&s;ked me in the &s;terne&s;t manner my rea&s;on for quitting the &s;hip: I told him the rea&s;on was, a dread of loo&s;ing my life, and in the &s;tate to which he had reduced me, I was good for nothing, and my lo&s;s could not be felt. The captain, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions were all &s;ub&s;ervient to his intere&s;t, finding that, while we were in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he harbour at lea&s;t, har&s;h mea&s;ures would not an&s;wer his purpo&s;e, immediately began to footh and coax me, de|claring him&s;elf &s;orry for what he had done, and a&s;&s;uring me I &s;hould never have rea&s;on for the future to com|plain. By &s;uch flattering promi&s;es I was ea&s;ily induced to forget the injuries he had done me, and once more to repair to my po&s;t, in hopes of more humane u&s;age dur|ing the remainder of the voyage. We were in hopes of being freighted in the tran&s;port-&s;ervice, but, upon in|&s;pection, our &s;hip was found unfit for it, being old and incommodious. We were therefore obliged to return to the We&s;t-Indies, as one of our owners lived in Antigua, who would find us a loading for Britain. Leaving the wharf therefore on the 13th of Jan. 1782, we went into
<PB N="37" REF="035035_0030_0FFFF52A42571B18">
the river Mohawk; where we were to take in our balla&s;t. About &s;ix hours afterwards, the tide beginning to ebb, brought the ice down in &s;uch large quantities, as made us tremble for the &s;afety of the &s;hip. All hands were employed with large poles to ward it off, but in &s;pite of every effort, the large &s;heets of ice cut our cables, and drove us on &s;hore among the rocks. All hopes of &s;aving the &s;hip, where now almo&s;t at an end; the Chatham and Experiment lying in the river, ob&s;erving our di&s;tre&s;s, &s;ent their boats with twelve men, and a lieutenant in each, to offer their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but to no purpo&s;e, till the tide returning, rai&s;ed us up again, and brought us off without any material damage. We then proceeded to a creek on Long-I&s;land &s;ide of the river, about one mile above New-York; but having lo&s;t our anchors, we were obliged to run our hawfer on board the pri&s;on-&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&punc; The fro&s;t at this time, &s;et in very inten&s;e; the river was frozen over, and we, as well as all the victuallers, and tran&s;ports, which generally lie here, were for &s;ome weeks blocked up. Our captain, during this interval, was very much out of humour with every one around him; and was daily giving proofs to every per&s;on on board, of a capricious temper. It went much again&s;t his nature to feed the men without giving them plenty of work. One day he would &s;end a party to the woods to bring fuel, which they were obliged to drag upon the ice, or to carry on their backs; next day he would employ them in cutting a pa&s;&s;age through the ice, for the boat to go a&s;hore; but as the di&s;tance was about a mile, and the

ice of an amazing thickne&s;s, they could only make &s;mall progre&s;s in one day; and what they did was to no purpo&s;e, as it was &s;ure to be hard frozen again before next morning. Thus during five weeks which we lay here, did this re&s;tle&s;s unhappy man, make every man's life as mi&s;erable as po&s;&s;ible; till at la&s;t, on the 17th of February, the ice began to break, and the pri&s;on-&s;hip letting go our haw&s;er, we drifted out of the creek; and being drove into the ebb tide of the Mohawk river, we got happily down to New-York again, where we took on board the remainder of our balla&s;t; and having got all clear for &s;ea, we only waited for a fair wind.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of March, we weighed anchor, and &s;et &s;ail, and the day being plea&s;ant, afforded us a mo&s;t en|chanting pro&s;pect of the beautiful country we were leaving behind. Between New-York and the ocean, lie Governor's-I&s;land, Staten-I&s;land, and Sandy-I&s;land. During the war, the &s;ick and wounded of the army and navy, were kept on Governor's-I&s;land, on account of its healthy &s;ituation, and the ready &s;upply of provi|&s;ions they had from Long-I&s;land. After you pa&s;s San|dy-I&s;land, the &s;ea opens into a large &s;ound, having Long-I&s;land on the one &s;ide, and New-Jer&s;ey on the other. Sandy Hook is a low point of &s;andy ground, which runs into the ocean: from this point we took our departure the &s;econd of March, directing our cour&s;e for the i&s;land of Antigua.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="035035_0032_0FFFF52FA3115350">During three weeks nothing material happened, and wind and weather favouring, we were likely to make a very plea&s;ant voyage; but the captain was determined to make it very unplea&s;ant to me; for when we got as far as 23 deg. lat. a number of whales were playing around us, and having never &s;een one, I was re&s;olved to &s;atisfy my curio&s;ity; and going up the &s;hrouds a little for this purpo&s;e, the captain coming on deck e&s;|pied me. From the time I had left the &s;hip at New-York, he had taken every opportunity of revenging him&s;elf, and I was certain my pre&s;ent curio&s;ity, how|ever natural, would co&s;t me dear. I was not deceived: the captain ordered me to be called, and when I ap|proached him, I &s;aw him prepared with a rope's-end, which he began to make u&s;e of with all his might for a con&s;iderable time. He continued his di&s;cipline till he ren|dered me incapable of moving, and when he let me go, he ordered me to quit his pre&s;ence; which I being una|ble to do, he laid hold of a log of wood, and &s;triking me over the head with it, I fell upon the deck as &s;en&s;e|le&s;s as the wood with which I received the blow. In this &s;ituation I remained for a con&s;iderable &s;pace; the blood which flowed fa&s;t from my wound, over&s;pread a part of the deck, and not one of the hands dur&s;t &s;ympa|tize with, or lend me the &s;malle&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Whil&s;t I lay in this wretched condition, a captain Campbell of the &s;ixty-ninth regiment, one of our pa&s;&s;engers, coming upon deck perceived me, and imagining me to be dead, enquired into the bu&s;ine&s;s: and being informed by one
<PB N="40" REF="035035_0033_0FFFF5335B2781F0">
of the hands, of my crime and puni&s;hment, he kindly made up to me, and taking me by the hand, rai&s;ed me on my feet, and endeavoured to re&s;tore me to my &s;cat|tered &s;en&s;es. It was &s;ometime before his endeavours were &s;ucce&s;sful, and when they were, he advi&s;ed me to lock up my cloaths, bloody as they were, till we got to Britain, where I might produce them as evidence again&s;t the captain, and get ample &s;atisfaction. With a kindne&s;s and humanity, which I &s;hall ever bear in grateful re|membrance, did this gentleman a&s;&s;i&s;t in dre&s;&s;ing my wounds; and when I was &s;omewhat recovered, he put a guinea into my hand, and &s;poke the fir&s;t con&s;olatory words I had ever heard from any one &s;ince my fir&s;t &s;et|ting out.</P>
<P>At this time I was only thirteen years of age, and the voice of tenderne&s;s by degrees reconciled me to life: I made the be&s;t acknowledgments I was able to my benefactor, and told him, I &s;hould in every re&s;pect fol|low his advice. He afterwards went to remon&s;trate with the captain about the u&s;age he had given me, and told him it would be remarkable if none of my friends brought him to puni&s;hment on our arrival in Britain. The other an&s;wered, he did not believe they &s;hould, for he certainly would kill me before ever I reached them; adding, "Had any one given me, as much as I have done him, I &s;hould have been dead my&s;elf." From what captain Campbell had &s;een and heard, he had lit|tle doubt of his putting the threat in execution; and in
<PB N="41" REF="035035_0034_0FFFF534E33440B8">
the evening he took an opportunity of charging me, as I valued my own life, to &s;tudy every method of plea&s;ing him, and to bear his u&s;age with all the patience I could mu&s;ter, as a little time would bring us to the end of our voyage, and put it in my power to take ample revenge. Encouraged by the&s;e hopes, I re&s;olved to conduct my|&s;elf &s;trictly by the advice I had received, and my wor|thy benefactor leaving me to re&s;t, I the next day, though extremely weak, attended at the call of my tyrant.</P>
<P>On the 28th of March we pa&s;&s;ed De&s;eada, an i&s;land belonging to the French, lying in 59 deg. we&s;t longi|tude, and 17, 30 deg. north lat. It is di&s;tant from Anti|gua about 30 leagues, E.S.E. is &s;eventeen miles long, and at the part that is broade&s;t, about twelve miles. It produces cotton, and &s;ome &s;mall quantity of &s;ugar; but little of the latter is &s;ent out of the i&s;land. Running down the north-&s;ide of Antigua, we pa&s;&s;ed the i&s;land of Barbuda: this is a &s;mall flat i&s;land, about twenty miles long, and from ten to twelve broad. The only &s;ervice derived from this i&s;land, is a &s;upply of fre&s;h provi&s;ions and fuel, for Antigua, e&s;pecially for the town of St. John's. Upon the fir&s;t of April we arrived at Antigua, and getting into harbour we began to repair our rig|ging, which with getting out our lumber, and making other preparations, kept us employed till the twentieth of May. The evening of that day we were &s;urprized with the appearance of a remarkable light from the head of the town, which gradually increa&s;ed, till at la&s;t, with
<PB N="42" REF="035035_0035_0FFFF5366CAB93D0">
a tremendous noi&s;e, it bur&s;t out, and the flames a&s;cend|ed to the clouds: it had broke out in a gentleman's rum &s;tore, and as the wind happened to blow from the end of the &s;treet, where the &s;tore was, it reduced in a &s;hort &s;pace of time one of the fine&s;t &s;treets in the town, to a heap of a&s;hes. Here the hou&s;es are only built of wood, and the &s;tores very plentiful. The conflagration there|fore was beyond all de&s;cription, rapid and dreadful; and the &s;hrieks of men, women, and children, running about in a &s;tate of di&s;traction, to &s;ave their relations, their property, and their lives, added to the horrors of the &s;cene. A few of the &s;tores, to which the flames were directing their cour&s;e, were emptied of their contents, and the ca&s;ks rolled into the &s;ea. But as the conflagra|tion was making rapid &s;trides towards the harbour, all the &s;hips were obliged to hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s. Very luckily however, it &s;topped at the water's edge, without doing any damage to the &s;hipping. Never was I witne&s;s to a more awful &s;pectacle, than the morning pre&s;ented to our view; nor perhaps did ever any coun|try produce a more wretched group of di&s;tracted, mi&s;|erable mortals, than pre&s;ented them&s;elves upon the pre|&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>On the eighth of June, another melancholy accident happened to a brig, lying along &s;ide of us. She was that day to &s;et &s;ail for the i&s;land of Newfoundland, and hav|ing cleared out of the harbour, they only waited for the captain and &s;ome pa&s;&s;engers, to come on board. A
<PB N="43" REF="035035_0036_0FFFF53A02675370">
quantity of powder which they had that day got on board, was carele&s;ly lying on the cabin floor, till they got time to put it into the magazine; and the two mates, going down to the cabin, began to examine &s;ome pi&s;|tols which lay be&s;ide them; and &s;napping one of them, the fire unhappily caught hold of the powder, and in a moment blew the ve&s;&s;el into the air. The dreadful ex|plo&s;ion alarmed the whole harbour, and ca&s;ting our eyes to whence it proceeded, we di&s;covered the &s;moke ri&s;ing in a va&s;t cloud, but the ve&s;&s;el was gone, all but the bottom. There were twelve men on board, and five of them being on the fore-yard, were taken up, without receiving any material damage, the re&s;t were never &s;een more. Some minutes after the explo&s;ion, a large piece of her fell near the place where &s;he lay; other parts of her were carried to the di&s;tance of a mile. What is re|markable, the captain, with a lady, her maid, and a young gentleman, who were going pa&s;&s;engers, were within a pi&s;tol &s;hot of her, going on board, when the accident happened. A boat, in attempting to pick up a dead body, &s;uppo&s;ed to be one of the unfortunate &s;uf|ferers, was pur&s;ued clo&s;ely by a &s;hark, and almo&s;t o|ver&s;et by it. The &s;hark was allowed to be about fourteen feet long, which for that fi&s;h is a remarkable &s;ize.&mdash;By this time we had got the half of our cargo on board; and as it was reported the fleet would &s;ail by the fir&s;t of July, we made all imaginable ha&s;te to be ready to &s;ail in it. This fleet was to comprehend all the &s;hips from the We&s;t-India i&s;lands, from Barbadoes to Torto|la:
<PB N="44" REF="035035_0037_0FFFF53D97E89EE8">
and was to be protected by one &s;eventy-four gun &s;hip, one of fifty, and three frigates.</P>
<P>During our &s;tay here, nothing more happened parti|cular; and by the time appointed, we were ready for &s;ea. Our cargo con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ugar, rum, and cotton, which we were to di&s;charge at Liverpool, and Gla&s;gow. Our &s;upply of water here, was &s;canty, and bad as can be imagined; it was taken from a pond, full of mud, and dirt, and &s;old at the enormous price of &s;ix dollars a ca&s;k; we therefore took in only &s;o much as would car|ry us down to the leeward. On the tenth of July our convoy arrived from St. Lucia, and brought with them thirty &s;ail; they were joined by forty more from this port, and on the fourteenth, we all &s;et &s;ail from Anti|gua, for St. Chri&s;topher's, where we were joined by twenty-five &s;ail more; and here we took in a plentiful &s;upply of water. Leaving St. Chri&s;topher's, we pro|ceeded to the Virgin-I&s;lands; and in going to the lee|ward, we had a view of St. Eu&s;tatia, which lies about three leagues to the we&s;tward of St. Chri&s;topher's; we likewi&s;e pa&s;&s;ed St. Bartholomew's, St. Martin's, and the Dog and Prickly-Pear; the&s;e two rocks are remarka|bly &s;teep and bold, and lie clo&s;e together. Some ve&s;|&s;els through curio&s;ity, pa&s;s between them, which in mild weather they may do without danger. St. Bartholo|mew is a low i&s;land, about twelve miles long, and five broad, and produces &s;ome &s;mall quantity of cotton, and con&s;iderable quantities of &s;alt are made, by the
<PB N="45" REF="035035_0038_0FFFF53F20E2F9D0">
heat of the &s;un. There are &s;ettlers here, from different nations, but the principal part are Danes. St. Martin's is &s;omewhat better than the former; it is about ten miles long, and &s;even broad; it produces &s;mall quanti|ties of &s;ugar, cotton, and coffee; and exports a con&s;ider|able quantity of &s;alt. The Virgin-I&s;lands, which are numerous, lie to the ea&s;tward of Portorico, but two of them only are of any note; namely, Tortola and St. Thomas's. Tortola produces only a &s;mall quantity of &s;ugar, but it is the mart of all Briti&s;h goods for the other i&s;lands; and they take in return, &s;ugar, coffee, &amp;c. Hence the trade of this i&s;land is pretty con&s;ider|able. The whole produce of the i&s;land of St. Thomas is trifling, and their trade carried on chiefly with the Spaniards; the town and harbour lie on the &s;outh &s;ide of the i&s;land, where there is a large bay, commanded by a fort and battery: their trade con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of mahog|any, logwood, &amp;c. which come from Portorico, and Hi&s;paniola, in the Spani&s;h main, and is carried on at a con&s;iderable ri&s;k, on the part of the &s;ailors; for if taken they are committed for life to the mines, the trade being prohibited. St. John's, a &s;mall i&s;land, in length eight miles, and in breadth two, lies on the ea&s;t of St. Thomas's. Crab-I&s;land lies on the &s;outh of Tor|tola: the&s;e two i&s;land form the ea&s;tern entrance into what is called the Virgins. In &s;ailing through this, and approaching towards St. John's, the pa&s;&s;age becomes very narrow, and there is con&s;tantly a &s;trong cur|rent. Our fleet being &s;o very numerous, required par|ticular
<PB N="46" REF="035035_0039_0FFFF540A92E9E28">
attention to keep the ve&s;&s;els clear one of an|other; and night comings on, every one crowded all the &s;ail he could, by which means con&s;iderable damage was done to &s;everal of the &s;hips. However, about &s;even that evening we got clear of the i&s;lands; and next day, being the eighteenth of July, we took our departure from them; our fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of one hun|dred and fifty &s;ail, was commanded by the honourable captain Cro&s;by, of the Robu&s;te; an officer who, by his care and attention, &s;hewed him&s;elf worthy of &s;o im|portant a charge.</P>
<P>We proceeded acro&s;s the trade-winds, directing our cour&s;e to the ea&s;tward, for the &s;pace of eight days, when we got into the variables. We had, among other pa&s;&s;engers, one of the owners of the &s;hip, with his wife and brother-in-law. One day as I &s;tood attending them at dinner, the captain began to quarrel with me about his fork; telling me, with many oaths and im|precations, that it was not clean. I an&s;wered nothing, remembering the advice given me by captain Camp|bell; and the a&s;&s;ertion he had made him, that he would never let me &s;ee my friends. The captain im|mediately got up, and aiming a blow with the fork in his hand, &s;truck it into my body: every one &s;eemed alarmed, and the owner e&s;pou&s;ing my cau&s;e, I told him, that was but a &s;mall &s;pecimen of his bad u&s;age, and that if he would &s;tep to the &s;teerage with me, I could give him proofs of his barbarity. His wife ro&s;e from
<PB N="47" REF="035035_0040_0FFFF54439070B78">
the table, and pulling the fork out of my brea&s;t, gave the captain a &s;evere reprimand, charging him, while &s;he was on board, never to let her &s;ee &s;uch another in|&s;tance of cruelty.</P>
<P>About this time another incident happened, which &s;hewed his di&s;po&s;ition in a ju&s;t light. One of the pa&s;|&s;engers had a negro maid &s;ervant, who having in &s;ome|thing or another di&s;obeyed her mi&s;tre&s;s, was &s;everely re|primanded by her: the captain &s;aid, that if &s;he belong|ed to him, he would certainly give her a good flog|ging; her mi&s;tre&s;s told him, &s;he would be much obli|ged to him if he would. Now it happened a few even|ings before, that the captain had a&s;ked a certain favour of this &s;ame negro wench, which &s;he had thought pro|per to refu&s;e; this had turned the love he bore her into the mo&s;t violent hatred: glad of an occa&s;ion of reveng|ing him&s;elf, he embraced the opportunity which the &s;anction of her mi&s;tre&s;s afforded him; and getting her upon deck, he tied her to one of the pumps, and was going to proceed. The pa&s;&s;engers were all a&s;&s;embled to &s;ee the operation, and none of them could forbear execrating the cruelty of a man, who in cool blood, and without any provocation, could &s;o deliberately think of inflicting &s;uch a puni&s;hment: one of the pa&s;|&s;engers &s;tepping forward, charged him at his peril to touch the girl, and ordered me to take her down. I proceeded to obey him, and the captain running to pre|vent me, was laid hold of by the pa&s;&s;enger, and a fu|rious
<PB N="48" REF="035035_0041_0FFFF547F8BC5290">
&s;cuffle en&s;ued, in which the pa&s;&s;enger was victo|rious, and gave him a hearty drubbing. Upon a pro|mi&s;e of better behaviour the pa&s;&s;enger let him go.</P>
<P>On the twentieth of Augu&s;t we were met by a heavy gale of wind, in which two &s;hips of the fleet, belong|ing to London, &s;teering different cour&s;es, ran foul of each other, by which accident one of them was &s;evere|ly damaged; the men during the whole night labour|ed at the pumps, and with the utmo&s;t difficulty kept her from &s;inking. Next morning the Lizard frigate got along &s;ide of her, to the great joy of the crew, who by that time had almo&s;t given up all hopes of life, and were in a &s;ituation truly deplorable. In a few minutes after they left her &s;he &s;unk. The gale continued &s;even days, and at the end of it we found our&s;elves near the coa&s;t of Ireland.</P>
<P>September the fir&s;t, we fell in with a frigate, &s;ent out from England, to order us to take the north chan|nel, as the French fleet was &s;uppo&s;ed to be in the mouth of the &s;outh channel; but on the &s;eventh, a lugger, which had likewi&s;e been di&s;patched to meet us, order|ed us to &s;teer for the &s;outh channel, which we did, and and on the twelfth we di&s;covered land, and found it to be Cape Clear: while we were four leagues di&s;tant from land, &s;everal boats were &s;ent off with fre&s;h provi&s;ions, &s;uch as butter, eggs, potatoes, &amp;c. which proved very acceptable to the pa&s;&s;engers. On the thirteenth, the
<PB N="49" REF="035035_0042_0FFFF54985CF8898">
commodore made a &s;ignal for all the fleet to proceed to their re&s;pective ports. One of the frigates was to go to the Bri&s;tol channel, the other to the North, or St. George's channel, and the commodore to the King's channel. We parted from the commodore on the fourteenth, along with &s;ix other merchant &s;hips, and proceeded up St. George's channel, under convoy of the Lizard. We mounted &s;ixteen guns, and had on board between thirty and forty men. On the even|ing of the fourteenth we were &s;aluted by a &s;trange &s;hip, who run up along &s;ide of us, and fired a gun. All hands were immediately called to quarters, and we gave her a whole broad &s;ide, which made her &s;heer off; but in the cour&s;e of a few minutes, &s;he returned, when we di&s;co|vered that we had been engaged, not with an American privateer, for &s;uch we imagined her to be, but with a Briti&s;h &s;loop of war, the Bonetta mounting eighteen guns, and then in the impre&s;&s;ing &s;ervice. On the fifteenth we had got as far in the channel as the banks of Dublin, when the commodore made a &s;ignal for us all to heave too, which we obeyed; and having gone through all the &s;hips, and taken &s;ome men out of each of them, he di|rected us to proceed.</P>
<P>On the &s;eventeenth we got as far as Beau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ris, where we took a pilot on board, and arrived at Liver|pool. At our entrance, the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers find|ing more &s;pirituous liquors than the legal allowance, on board, &s;eized the &s;hip, and prevented us from entering
<PB N="50" REF="035035_0043_0FFFF54D23A248B0">
the dock; but the owners upon application to the board, got the ve&s;&s;el cleared, by paying a &s;um of money, and loo&s;ing all the &s;tores. During the time we lay here, di&s;charging our cargo, the captain was become as mild and gentle in his treatment of me, as before he had been tyrannical. He &s;eldom went a&s;hore that he did not take me with him: in all his tran&s;actions he con&s;ulted me, and was now quicker &s;ighted in di&s;covering virtues, than he had hitherto been in finding faults. Every day brought me &s;ome fre&s;h pre&s;ent from him; cloaths, &s;hirts, &s;hoes, every article of wearing apparel, he now loaded me with, and in every re&s;pect behaved with &s;uch a de|gree of &s;ervility, and meanne&s;s, as would have a&s;toni&s;h|ed me, had I not known perfectly how to account for it. He &s;u&s;pected, and ju&s;tly, that I had pre&s;erved my bloo|dy cloaths, to produce as evidence again&s;t him. And one day after he had expre&s;&s;ed a wonderful degree of affection for me, he de&s;ired me to &s;hew him all my cloaths, and &s;hirts, that he might &s;ee, what I wanted, and have me properly equipped. I &s;hewed him all I had on board; but upon our fir&s;t landing, I had carried tho&s;e he wanted to lay hold of, a&s;hore, and placed them out of his reach. Thus by his cruelty, and bar|barity, had this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> man put him&s;elf in my pow|er; and the extreme &s;ervility with which he treated me, convinced me of a truth which I have often &s;ince had occa&s;ion to remark, viz. that the greate&s;t tyrants are the greate&s;t cowards.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="035035_0044_0FFFF54EAA9DE1B0">On the twenty-eighth of October, we were ready for &s;ea, having unloaded &s;o much of our cargo, as was in|tended for Liverpool, and as the re&s;t was con&s;igned to Port-Gla&s;gow, we &s;et &s;ail for that place. The extreme kindne&s;s of the captain, during this voyage, had entire|ly obliterated the remembrance of his former u&s;age; and in con&s;equence I had &s;eriou&s;ly determined to for|give him. He had however, bribed the other appren|tices to di&s;cover my bloody cloaths, and one of them &s;ucceeding, carried them on board to him. He had no &s;ooner laid his hands upon them, than calling me to him, de&s;ired me to take a la&s;t look of them, and in the greate&s;t triumph, threw them into the &s;ea. From Liverpool to Port-Gla&s;gow, we had on board only &s;even men, and nine boys, who had left the lat|ter port with us, when we fir&s;t &s;et out, and had e&s;cap|ed being pre&s;&s;ed; with the&s;e, however, we made out to navigate the &s;hip, and on the fifth of November we landed at Port-Gla&s;gow, after a voyage of near eighteen months, di&s;agreeable on account of the tyran|ny and caprice of our captain.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN we landed at Port-Gla&s;gow, I obtained leave of the gentleman, to whom I was bound, to vi&s;it my friends; whom I found all well, and rejoi|ced to &s;ee me once more at home. I enjoyed their &s;o|ciety only about a fortnight, when I was &s;ummon|ed by my ma&s;ter to repair to my po&s;t; and upon my vi&s;iting him, I was informed, that he had purcha&s;ed a &s;chooner of 100 tons burden, which he intended to &s;end to New-York. As the war &s;till continued, and hands were uncommonly &s;earce, he ordered all the appren|tices who had been in the &s;hip I la&s;t &s;ailed in, to pre|pare for the voyage. We were nine in number, and with the addition of a captain, mate, and carpenter, were to con&s;titute the crew. At Greenock, we took in a loading of coals, which we were to di&s;charge at Cork,
<PB N="54" REF="035035_0047_0FFFF557A5B10C40">
and to take in a cargo of butter, beef, pork, &amp;c. for the Bri&s;tol army at New-York. Every per&s;on reprobated the idea of &s;ending &s;o &s;mall a ve&s;&s;el deep loaden, manned as ours was, acro&s;s the Atlantic, at &s;o late a &s;ea&s;on of the year; for it was on the twenty-&s;ixth of November, 1782, that we weighed anchor, and got under way; but the wind coming contrary, we were obliged to put in to Fairly-road, a harbour on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the mouth of the Clyde. On the twenty-ninth, the wind coming fa|vourable, we put to &s;ea, and proceeded &s;o far as the Mull of Galloway, when we were again obliged by con|trary wind, to put about for the harbour of Campble|town. This harbour is about two miles long and one and a half broad, to the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Mull of Kyn|tyre.</P>
<P>Here we remained till the third of December, when we again &s;et &s;ail, and getting through the channel with a &s;teady breeze, we arrived at the Cove of Cork on the tenth, where we came to anchor. Next morning, with the fir&s;t of the tide, we proceeded to the town of Pa&s;&s;age; and on the twelfth, began to di&s;charge our cargo into lighters, which carried the coals up to the city. I need &s;carcely inform my reader, that Cork is the &s;econd city in Ireland, for magnitude, grandeur, and trade; it lies one hundred and twenty miles &s;outh we&s;t of Dublin, and contains upwards of eight thou&s;and hou&s;es; its haven is deep and well &s;heltered, but &s;mall ve&s;&s;els only can get to the city, which lies &s;even miles up the river Lee.

Large ve&s;&s;els load and di&s;charge their cargoes at Cove Pa&s;&s;age, and the Rock. The &s;mall craft, of cour&s;e, are very numerous upon the river, every merchant having one or more for his own u&s;e. As this is the chief port in the kingdom, for victualling &s;hips, their trade in this way is immen&s;e: almo&s;t every ve&s;&s;el, bound from Bri|tain to America, the We&s;t-Indies, or the Mediter|ranian, takes in the greate&s;t part of its &s;tores here. Cork is well built, and &s;tands upon a ri&s;ing ground: the principal &s;treets are broad and elegant; but like mo&s;t of the hou&s;es, have a mean appearance at the extremities. There are &s;even e&s;tabli&s;hed churches, &s;ix Roman Catho|lic chapels, one &s;ociety of Quakers, and two Pre&s;by|terian meeting hou&s;es. The pea&s;antry are very healthy, athletic, and &s;trong, and embrace every opportunity of trying their &s;trength one again&s;t another, e&s;pecially if they have had a &s;ufficient do&s;e of their favourite liquor, wi&s;key: but to &s;trangers they are generous, humane, and ho&s;pitable, to a proverb. It was not till the twenty-eighth of January, that we fini&s;hed our lading, and were ready to &s;ail; on that day we left Cork, and having a favourable breeze from the northward, we got as far &s;outh as cape Fini&s;tere on the fifth of February; that day however the wind veering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the &s;outh-we&s;t, began to blow a hurricane, which &s;oon obliged us to heave our &s;hip too; and on the &s;ixth, we were &s;truck by a &s;ea, which totally di&s;abled us, and rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for us to proceed, having &s;prung our forema&s;t, and bow-&s;prit, and carried away the cabin &s;cuttle, raf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er, binna|cle,
<PB N="56" REF="035035_0049_0FFFF55C0C8667D8">
and companion, and almo&s;t foundered our little ve&s;&s;el. We had no time for he&s;itation, but repairing our damage, in the be&s;t manner our &s;ituation would admit off, we bore away before the &s;ea, for Li&s;bon, not with|out the greate&s;t apprehen&s;ions of going to the bottom before we reached the port, the water being four feet deep in the hold. On the eighth we fell in with a large cutter from Guern&s;ey, in a pitiable condition, as &s;he could not run for any port, the &s;ea ran &s;o high; and being extremely low in the &s;tern, &s;he was not capable of &s;ounding. Our condition was &s;o extremely bad, we were incapable of affording her any relief. During all that day, the gale continued to increa&s;e, and night brought with it the mo&s;t dreadful apprehen&s;ions; nor was it till the morning of the tenth, that we made the Rock of Li&s;bon. The entrance into this harbour is danger|ous, on account of a number of &s;and-banks, which lie at the mouth of the river, and frequently vary their po&s;ition; as we were all &s;trangers, and no pilot boat dur&s;t venture out, our &s;ituation was &s;ufficiently preca|rious. There remained nothing for us but to make a bold pu&s;h on a venture, which we did, and were lucky enough to get &s;afe over the bar. The Rock of Li&s;bon, remarkable for its height, &s;tands at the mouth of the river Tagus. Upon entering the river, a beautiful view of the city pre&s;ents it&s;elf, together with the different fortre&s;&s;es, that guard the pa&s;&s;age up to it; one of them, called <HI>Fort-Petre,</HI> &s;tands upon the left hand, and con|tains near one hundred pieces of cannon, placed in
<PB N="57" REF="035035_0050_0FFFF55E992EFDB0">
three rows, one above another; we pa&s;&s;ed this and ano|ther of le&s;s note, and went up as far as Beli&s;le-Ca&s;tle, when we were obliged to bring to anchor, till we got a permit. Here we lay for three days, and having obtained our object, we proceeded to the harbour to repair our damage.</P>
<P>Li&s;bon, the capital of Portugal, &s;tands upon the river Tagus, and before the year 1755, when it was almo&s;t de&s;troyed by an earthquake, it was a large, magnificent, and &s;trong city. It is &s;ituated about ten miles above the mouth of the river; and the harbour, when once the &s;hips get over the bar, is perhaps as good as any in Europe, and capable of containing &s;everal thou&s;and ve&s;&s;els. The city &s;tands upon &s;loping ground, which ri&s;es gradually from the river, and pre&s;ents to the eye the whole of it at one view, where palaces and churches, &s;quares and public buildings, form a mo&s;t beautiful pro&s;pect. Though the city is far from being &s;o large as it was before the earthquake, yet that dreadful vi&s;itation has had the effect of rendering it more beautiful; as the &s;treets, in that part of the city which was de&s;troyed, are con&s;iderably widened, and the hou&s;es built in a very &s;uperior &s;tile. They are mo&s;tly four or five &s;tories high, remarkably uniform, and all built of a kind of white &s;tone, which has the appearance of marble, at a little di&s;tance. The church|es are numerous, and have excellent bells, which are almo&s;t continually ringing. The royal palace &s;tands
<PB N="58" REF="035035_0051_0FFFF56020B67F18">
con&s;picuous, on a beautiful eminence, and has a mo&s;t delightful appearance. Strangers are readily admitted to &s;ee both the hou&s;e and gardens, on giving a &s;mall gratification to the keepers. The climate is mild; and numbers from the northern countries of Europe, carry hither a broken con&s;titution to get it repaired, and return with a new lea&s;e of life. Here the earth &s;pontaneou&s;ly produces all kinds of vegetables, fruits, and flowers; but whether it be that the &s;oil, or the extreme indo|lence of the inhabitants, prevents the growth of corn, certain it is, that it is always a &s;carce article in Por|tugal, unle&s;s imported from foreign countries. Indeed agriculture, and all the u&s;eful arts, are e&s;teemed altoge|ther below the dignity of the rich and the noble; and the poorer &s;ort are &s;o cramped by the de&s;poti&s;m of the government, and their minds &s;o deba&s;ed by the &s;hackles of &s;uper&s;tition, that every thing noble or u&s;e|ful is lo&s;t in the will of the &s;overeign, or the influence of the prie&s;t. To divert their minds from reflection or &s;tudy, public entertainments are tolerated and encour|aged, which tend only to &s;ink them &s;till deeper in the aby&s;s of brutality and in&s;en&s;ibility. One of the prin|cipal &s;quares in the city is &s;et apart for the inhuman amu&s;ement of bull-baiting, from which they go with the greate&s;t devotion to a religious proce&s;&s;ion, and fall &s;quat in the dirtie&s;t part of the city, at the image of our Saviour, the Virgin Mary; or indeed &s;o little &s;paring are they of their cloaths, that they &s;cruple not to dirty them for the meane&s;t &s;aint in the calendar. But not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="59" REF="035035_0052_0FFFF563DE8A38D8">
their devotions, no country in the world, perhaps, abounds with more &s;lagitious crimes. Mur|der is &s;o common, that in its mo&s;t aggravated &s;en&s;e, it excites but little emotion. Strangers in particular run the greate&s;t ri&s;k: if found in the &s;treets at night, they are di&s;patched without noi&s;e, plundered of any thing valuable they have in their cu&s;tody, found dead in the morning, and buried without any further enquiry. Night &s;eems to be the only time they are capable of en|terprize; li&s;tle&s;s and indolent during the day, they doze away the hours in &s;loth and inactivity, and even frequently lay them&s;elves down to &s;leep in corners of the &s;treets. The &s;ame li&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit, &s;eems to pervade every department of &s;ociety, and even their govern|ment &s;eems half a&s;leep. It is true, when they do pu|ni&s;h, their puni&s;hments are inflicted with the utmo&s;t &s;e|verity; but this happens &s;eldom, and has very little ef|fect upon the morals of &s;ociety. Indeed the holy fathers of the Inqui&s;ition form one exception to the general character of the Portugue&s;e; for did their &s;alvation de|pend upon their exertions, they could not be more ac|tive in puni&s;hing evil doers: but &s;o long as the people meddle not with the religion as e&s;tabli&s;hed, attempt no philo&s;ophical experiments, and &s;peak with reverence of that <HI>venerable</HI> body, they may break the whole deca|logue, without coming under that denomination.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we continued at Li&s;bon, an Engli&s;h frigate ar|rived with the news of a peace between England and
<PB N="60" REF="035035_0053_0FFFF56782A80208">
the other powers, with which &s;he had been at war, and though the Portegue&s;e had no hand in the quarrel, the intelligence was received with a general joy. The En|gli&s;h merchants, re&s;iding here, and captains of trading ve&s;&s;els in the harbour, were loud in expre&s;&s;ing their &s;a|tisfaction; and all ranks and degrees &s;eemed unanimous, in hailing the return of tranquility and peace. Intelli|gence was immediately di&s;patched to the queen, who was then at Braga, and who in&s;tantly came back to the metropolis, to join in the public rejoicings. She per|formed her journey, which was about one hundred and eighty miles, by water. She was attended by a number of barges, decorated in a very elegant manner; but the barge which contained the royal pa&s;&s;enger, was grand beyond de&s;cription. It was beautifully painted, and gilt, and con&s;iderably larger than the re&s;t, with an elegant a|partment rai&s;ed over it for the accommodation of the queen and her &s;uit. The re&s;t of the barges were filled with the principal nobility and gentry, and were in general about one hundred feet long. Each of them had from &s;ixty to eighty oars, rowed by men, all dre&s;&s;ed in white cloaths, with black caps upon their heads. The whole city was in a bu&s;tle, and the people a&s;&s;embled in crowds, in all the public places, where there was any chance of &s;eeing their &s;overeign. She landed a little below the palace; all her guards were ready to receive her, every &s;hip in the harbour hung out colours, &s;hips of war gave her the royal &s;alute, as did al&s;o the ca&s;tle, and fort. She was received by a guard of one thou&s;and
<PB N="61" REF="035035_0054_0FFFF569093479D0">
hor&s;e, and three thou&s;and foot, in the middle of which &s;he took her &s;tation, and the proce&s;&s;ion marched &s;lowly on to the palace. The calvalcade was joined by coaches and hor&s;es, and an immen&s;e multitude of both &s;exes, and all denominations, followed in the rear; and from the curio&s;ity expre&s;&s;ed by the crowd, one would have ima|gined they had never beheld their &s;overeign before.</P>
<P>After witne&s;&s;ing this &s;cene, I was about to return to the ve&s;&s;el, along with &s;ome of my me&s;s-mates, who like my&s;elf, had come a&s;hore to gratify our curio&s;ity. But we had not proceeded far, when our ears were &s;aluted by &s;omething like the &s;ound of mu&s;ic; turning round we &s;aw about two hundred men, dre&s;&s;ed in the clergical habit, marching along the &s;treet. As they approached us, we di&s;covered the crowd fall po&s;trate; and when they came up to us, all our neighbours were lying among our feet. As none of us had ever been in the country before, we were at a lo&s;s to a&s;&s;ign a rea&s;on for this extraordinary humiliation, and we did not think proper to follow the example. The proce&s;&s;ion was preceded by twelve flambeaux, which were followed by twenty prie&s;ts, eve|ry one carrying an image in his hand. The Virgin Mary, with a number of attendants, and three flambeaux, followed next, and after all, our Saviour upon the cro&s;s, &s;urrounded by a number of flambeaux, all carried by young men. Hitherto we retained our upright po&s;ture, but had &s;oon rea&s;on to repent our &s;ingularity; for a few ruffiian-like fellows came up to us, and knocked
<PB N="62" REF="035035_0055_0FFFF56A920DFE78">
us all down. They &s;tripped our jackets off, made free with our hats, and left us to bewail our misfortunes, and &s;cramble to our boat in the be&s;t manner we were able. For my own &s;hare I received &s;uch a blow, as I would not have had &s;econded, for a &s;ight of the Virgin Mary, and all the other &s;aints in the calendar. Upon our relating our mi&s;adventure to the captain, he told us we might think our&s;elves extremely lucky, in getting off at &s;o cheap a rate, and that the wonder was we were not &s;acrificed, to appea&s;e the fury of the offended &s;aints.</P>
<P>The natives of Portugal, are of a dark &s;warthy com|plexion, and few of them grow to what an Engli&s;hman would call the middle &s;ize. They are in general, proud, vindictive and cruel; and though the women have a greater degree of liberty here, than in Spain, the men are not a little addicted to jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>Soon after we arrived here, our captain and mate, upon &s;ome &s;light difference, had come to high words, and the mate had left the &s;hip, to the great grief of the other hands, with whom he was a particular favourite. Our captain finding he could not well do without him, or perhaps afraid the owners would blame him for part|ing with a man of con&s;iderably greater experience than him&s;elf, determined to find him out, and make conce&s;|&s;ions to him; in this he &s;ucceeded, before the nece&s;&s;ary repairs were fini&s;hed. On the fourth of March we
<PB N="63" REF="035035_0056_0FFFF56F452DE5B0">
weighed anchor, and bade idieu to this land of &s;uper|&s;tition, with a fine ea&s;terly wind, which brought us as far as the i&s;land of Madeira, on the fourteenth. This i&s;land is of a triangular form, and was di&s;covered, as it is &s;aid, by an Engli&s;h gentleman, in the year 1344, and conquered by the Portegue&s;e in 1431. The latter kin|dling a fire in a fore&s;t to warm them&s;elves, it continued to burn for a con&s;iderable number of years, by which means the i&s;land was much fertilized. The air is tem|perate and &s;erene; and no kind of venomous animal is to be found in it. Here are produced oranges, lemons, pomegranates, corn, wheat, honey, &amp;c. But what ren|ders this i&s;land mo&s;t famous, is the wine it produces, which takes its name from that of the i&s;land, and is much reli&s;hed in Europe, e&s;pecially after it has been carried to the We&s;t-Indies. There is only one town on the i&s;land, called Funchal, &s;ituated at the bottom of a large bay, on the &s;outh &s;ide of the i&s;land. It is defended by batteries, and is the only place where even a boat can go a&s;hore; and that it&s;elf is not practicable at all times, as there is a continual &s;urf beating upon the &s;ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. There are merchants &s;ettled here, from every nation in Europe, but the greater part are Briti&s;h, who carry on a con&s;iderable trade to the We&s;t-Indies. The inhabi|tants are in general Portugue&s;e, and the i&s;land is &s;ubject to the crown of Portugal. In the neighbourhood of this i&s;land lies Porto-Sancho, about fifteen miles in cir|cumference, where are plenty of wild hogs, and a va&s;t
<PB N="64" REF="035035_0057_0FFFF571CEAECDE8">
number of rabbits. It has excellent mooring in the road, in which &s;hips to and from India generally &s;top.</P>
<P>Leaving Madeira, we directed our cour&s;e we&s;tward, for the coa&s;t of America, and being for &s;ome days fa|voured with plea&s;ant weather, we amu&s;ed our&s;elves by &s;triking fi&s;h, particularly the porpoi&s;e, great numbers of of which daily &s;urrounded us. But upon the twenty-eighth we di&s;covered a ve&s;&s;el &s;teering to the we&s;tward, at &s;ome di&s;tance a &s;tern of us, and being a remarkable fa&s;t &s;ailor, we found &s;he mu&s;t &s;peedily come up to us. Upon her nearer approach, we &s;u&s;pected her to be an American privateer. Our captain being a very young man, with rather more valour than di&s;cretion, wanted to have a bru&s;h at her, though he had heard of the peace at Li&s;bon; and a very pretty battle we &s;hould have made of it, three or four men, and nine boys, to op|po&s;e thirty &s;tout &s;eamen, and fourteen guns. Upon com|ing up to us we hailed her, and to our great &s;atisfac|tion, found her to be a brig belonging to the &s;ame own|ers with our&s;elves, and bound to the &s;ame port. She had it &s;eems, been purcha&s;ed after we &s;ailed from the Clyde, and &s;ent to Cork to take in a cargo, &s;even weeks after our departure. With this ve&s;&s;el we kept company till we reached our port. On the thirteenth of April, we made the coa&s;t of America, but found our&s;elves &s;outh of New-York. As we &s;tood to the northward, we were met by an American privateer who had been from her port about eight weeks: &s;he
<PB N="65" REF="035035_0058_0FFFF5735558DBE8">
had heard nothing of the treaty of peace, and immedi|ately &s;he boarded us, and in &s;pite of all our remon|&s;trances, made us her prize; till another privateer com|ing up, told her they had the intelligence of peace from an Engli&s;h privateer of much &s;uperior force, who would have made a prize of them, if the information had been fal&s;e. The frigate which boarded us, was the A&s;&s;ur|ance, captain Evans, who put us all on board his own &s;hip, and u&s;ed us with the utmo&s;t civility during our captivity. Upon receiving the above intelligence, he made a &s;ignal for our ve&s;&s;el to heave too, and putting us on board of her, wi&s;hed us a good voyage. When we began to examine our own ve&s;&s;el, we found &s;everal things mi&s;&s;ing, &s;uch as cloaths and &s;tores, and not doubt|ing but the American &s;ailors had made free with them, we complained to captain Evans, who immediately cau|&s;ed the &s;tricte&s;t &s;earch to be made, and every thing to be re&s;tored to the rightful owners. On the fifteenth of April we arrived at our intended port, and came to an|chor near the place where we were to di&s;charge, and next day put into a wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> where we were to lie till our cargo was cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ared out.</P>
<P>The unconquerable de&s;ire I had always entertained of &s;eeing the world, was not yet gratified. I had no wi&s;h to return to my own country, without having a more exten&s;ive view of the new world; and without imparting my intention to any of my me&s;s mates, I I began to mediate a de&s;ign of making my e&s;cape. As
<PB N="66" REF="035035_0059_0FFFF574DEF2A350">
I was &s;till very young, I had but little hopes of receiv|ing any encouragement from a &s;tranger; but I was re|&s;olved not to make many words about the article of wages. One day as we were getting &s;ome lumber out of a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, from New-London, I a&s;ked the ma&s;|ter what wages would be given in that country, to &s;uch a lad as I was: he an&s;wered without he&s;itation, that he would give me eight dollars per month. This gave me all the encouragement I wi&s;hed, and made me &s;e|riou&s;ly re&s;olve, the fir&s;t favourable opportunity that oc|curred, to become my own ma&s;ter. After our cargo was di&s;po&s;ed of, our captain had orders to expo&s;e the &s;hip to &s;ale; but not meeting with a purcha&s;er, his next orders were, to proceed to Antigua. I had delay|ed my &s;cheme of eloping, till the evening before the &s;hip was to &s;ail. The ma&s;ter of the little American ve&s;|&s;el who offered to engage me, proffered his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and getting as many of my cloaths &s;muggled out of the &s;hip as I conveniently could, I left her in the even|ing; and next morning, to my great &s;atisfaction, &s;aw her &s;et &s;ail for Antigua. During the day, as I was patroling the &s;treets, I met with three of my &s;hip|mates, who told me they had left the &s;hip immediately after me. Our meeting was joyful: only one thing &s;at heavy upon our &s;pirits&mdash;among us all we had not two dollars. The little we had, however, was common, and enabled us to &s;pend the evening together; but a new day brought with it new wants, and we were all obliged to be as expeditious as po&s;&s;ible in finding em|ployment.
<PB N="67" REF="035035_0060_0FFFF5787956D540">
Hands were now very plentiful, the peace having thrown numbers out of employ; and for three days no one would have any thing to &s;ay to me. By this time I began to repent my ra&s;hne&s;s, in leaving my own ve&s;&s;el. The American captain, who had proffered me &s;uch hand&s;ome wages, was &s;ailed I knew not whi|ther, and I began to think my ca&s;e de&s;perate enough.</P>
<P>On the morning of the fourth day, I went along &s;ide of a brig, which was taking in balla&s;t, and inquired of one of the men, if the captain wanted a hand. He told me he did, and he believed I would an&s;wer his purpo&s;e. As the captain was gone a&s;hore, I re&s;olved to wait till his return, and the more to recommend my&s;elf, I began with all my might to heave in balla&s;t. It was not long till the captain came on board, and inquiring who I was, I told him I wanted to go a voyage with him, and &s;hould make no terms with him, but take whatever he cho&s;e to give me. He liked my propo&s;al, and told me I &s;hould not fare the wor&s;e for my diffidence in a&s;king. &mdash;Mr. Seaton, for that was our captain's name, had &s;omething in his appearance and manners, inexpre&s;&s;ibly engaging. He was about &s;ixty years of age; his looks and behaviour to his crew, had more of the parent than the ma&s;ter in them. Every word he &s;poke com|manded re&s;pect, and in all his actions he di&s;played the integrity and &s;implicity of the hone&s;t uncontaminated American. From the fir&s;t moment I &s;aw him, he drew from me &s;omething like a filial reverence. This made
<PB N="68" REF="035035_0061_0FFFF57C0FCD8070">
me a&s;&s;iduous to plea&s;e, and I found my&s;elf extremely happy in being told my endeavours were &s;ucce&s;sful. The ve&s;&s;el he commanded, had, during the war, been captured from the Americans, and &s;old at New-York, about &s;ix months after &s;he had been built, and at this time &s;he was not above a year at &s;ea: the gentleman who had bought her lived at Alexandria, in Virginia, and thither we were bound. During our pa&s;&s;age the captain treated me with marks of di&s;tinction, which were highly flattering. He would often call me into the cabin, and chat away whole hours with me; or make me read to him, when we found nothing to &s;ay; and, in &s;hort, made me as happy as I po&s;&s;ibly could ex|pect to be, in the line of life I had cho&s;en.</P>
<P>One day as we were chatting together, he told me, he had taken a particular fancy to me, and the rea&s;on was, that I re&s;embled a &s;on of his &s;o much, that every time he &s;aw me, he thought he was ri&s;en from the dead. He told me, this &s;on, though but very young, had di&s;&s;uaded him with all the rhetorick he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, from the only action of his life of which he was a&s;ham|ed, and which would embitter all his future days. In the cour&s;e of his conver&s;ation, I learned that he had been entru&s;ted with the command of a &s;hip in the &s;er|vice of the American States, but that in the cour&s;e of the war he had become &s;o violent a royali&s;t, that he had &s;ettled an account with his con&s;cience, and run the ve&s;&s;el into New-York, where &s;he was delivered to
<PB N="69" REF="035035_0062_0FFFF57EA6F874A8">
the Briti&s;h by his particular de&s;ire; and now he was entru&s;ted with the command of this pre&s;ent &s;hip, only to navigate her to Alexandria. The owner of this brig intended her for a coa&s;ting trade, from Virginia to Philadelphia, and the above-mentioned circum&s;tance had put it out of our captain's power to go to the lat|ter place, or even to make a public appearance in the former. Towards the end of our voyage he had me con&s;tantly with him, and often a&s;ked me, if I would con&s;ent to remain with him, a&s;&s;uring me at the &s;ame time, that I would meet a kind reception from his wife, and in every re&s;pect be put upon the footing of a &s;on. I had no intention of complying with his re|que&s;t, and therefore made no po&s;itive promi&s;es. My extreme de&s;ire of &s;eeing the world, did not at all a|gree with his plan of &s;ettling in America; and though I am certain I lo&s;t the whole of his fortune by not com|plying, which was not incon&s;iderable, I per&s;evered in my re&s;olution of &s;eeing more of the world.</P>
<P>He told me he was to return no more to New-York, as that town was now to be given up to the Americans; but was to go to the Briti&s;h &s;ettlements, where he was allotted a portion of land, as a refugee, and that to the la&s;t moment of his life, he &s;hould regret the unlucky tran&s;action, that rendered a reconciliation with his for|mer friends impractable. On the fourteenth of May, we pa&s;&s;ed the two points of land, called Capes, which open a pa&s;&s;age into the bay of Che&s;apeak; into which
<PB N="70" REF="035035_0063_0FFFF5804A9EEAF8">
many large navigable rivers empty them&s;elves, &s;uch as the Potomak, James' river, York river, &amp;c. which are all navigable for many miles up the country. On the fifteenth we got as far up the bay as the Wind-mill Point, which lies at the mouth of York river, and here we came to anchor, and took on board a pilot to car|ry us up the river Potomak. On the &s;ixteenth we weighed anchor, and had the plea&s;ante&s;t pa&s;&s;age ima|gination can paint: the country on either &s;ide is delight|ful; it is mo&s;tly cleared of wood, and furni&s;hes a mo&s;t beautiful land&s;cape. Here the banks of the river are inter&s;per&s;ed with country &s;eats, &s;urrounded by gardens, which produce all the vegitative luxuries of nature. In all my wanderings through this world, I never met with a man, I thought &s;o truly happy as an American far|mer. His looks are the index of health, and his man|ners of independence. The pride and &s;oppery of Euro|pean nations are here unknown, but all the &s;olid advan|tages of life are enjoyed in the greate&s;t perfection. The earth bountifully rewards the toil of the hu&s;band|man; his farm &s;upplies him with food, his orchard with drink. A moderate &s;hare of labour only is nece&s;&s;ary&mdash; nature does much. He is looked upon as the mo&s;t re|&s;pectable member of &s;ociety. At home he commands a kind of patriarchal reverence, and abroad he neither is obliged to give, nor receive that ful&s;ome adulation, that language of art, which reduces men below the dignity of nature; and a moderate &s;hare of application and fru|gality, enables him to leave the world, with the plea&s;ing
<PB N="71" REF="035035_0064_0FFFF583D52E9798">
pro&s;pect of bequeathing to his children, a competency to enable them to &s;et out in life, when he &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P>In our pa&s;&s;age from the Capes to Alexandria, we pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal towns in miniature, both in Virginia and Maryland. Alexandria, the principal trading town, is di&s;tant from the Capes about three hundred miles. It is built upon a bank, ri&s;ing gradually from the river. The plan intended &s;eems to re&s;emble that of Philadel|phia, the &s;treets inter&s;ecting one another, at right angles. On our landing here, the captain renewed his &s;olicita|tions for me to go into exile with him, for &s;o he termed the &s;ettlement allotted him in Briti&s;h-America; but as I continued firm in my re&s;olution, he gave over pre&s;|&s;ing me; and after giving me a pecuniary mark of his re&s;pect, and many whole&s;ome advices in private, with a heavy heart he bade us all adieu. We were now left without a captain, but the mate a&s;&s;uming the command, we began to take in our cargo, which con&s;i&s;ted of tobac|co and wheat; and in a little time after our cargo was completed, a captain came on board. The gentleman proved to be good-natured, and agreeable. The beha|viour of my commanders, &s;ince I entered into the trade of America, had made me &s;till fonder of the life I had cho&s;en, and had made me totally forget the mi&s;eries of my fir&s;t &s;etting out; I determined therefore not to be in ha&s;te to leave this country. We &s;ailed from Alexandria on the eighteenth of May, and proceeded for Philadel|phia.
<PB N="72" REF="035035_0065_0FFFF5865E81EFC0">
After we had pa&s;&s;ed the Capes of Virginia, in the cour&s;e of the night, we &s;truck upon a bank of &s;and, which lies fourteen leagues ea&s;t of Cape-Charles, and a|bout twelve miles from the &s;hore. The weather being favourable, however, we kept in the ve&s;&s;el, re&s;olving to wait the i&s;&s;ue of the next tide. This an&s;wered our wi&s;h|es, for next day the tide ri&s;ing higher, and the wind ta|king a favourable direction, &s;he was got off without any material damage. For &s;everal days we were to&s;&s;ed about by contrary winds, and having only laid in provi&s;ions for eight days, and being twice that number at &s;ea, we were all put upon &s;hort allowance. We pa&s;&s;ed the two points of land called Cape-Henlopen, and Cape-May, which form the bay of Delaware. This bay is ex|tremely dangerous, on account of a number of &s;hoals, banks, and ridges of rocks, with which it abounds. One of the latter, called the Frying-Pan, extends half acro&s;s, and is in length about fifteen miles. It is covered at half-tide, and &s;hips that have no pilot on board, are o|bliged to go by &s;oundings. The river Delaware divides the &s;tate of Jer&s;ey on the ea&s;t, and Maryland on the &s;outh and we&s;t, from Penn&s;ylvania; and is navigable one hun|and fifty miles from the &s;ea. This river opens an ea&s;y communication with the inland country.</P>
<P>On the fourth of June, we came to anchor, at the mouth of the Delaware, till the tide made next morn|ing, when we weighed anchor, and &s;ailing up the river we pa&s;&s;ed Ready-I&s;land, a &s;mall &s;pot, which in the me|mory

of &s;ome per&s;ons &s;till alive, was covered all over at low water, and is now from two to three feet above the &s;urface of the water in the highe&s;t tides. It is all covered with reeds, and is every year growing &s;omewhat lar|ger. Immediately after this, we pa&s;&s;ed the town of Newca&s;tle, which &s;tands clo&s;e by the river-&s;ide. The country on both &s;ides is cleared of wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, and pre&s;ents a beautiful, and rich pro&s;pect. The river at this time was much incommoded by a number of chevaux-de|frize, placed by the Americans to prevent the Briti&s;h fleet from getting up to Philadelphia. Oppo&s;ite to the&s;e &s;tands fort Mifflin, on a &s;mall i&s;land, which is the only place of &s;trength in the river. In the year 1777, the Briti&s;h were enabled to take this fort by the follow|ing &s;tratagem:&mdash;The i&s;land was fortified only on the &s;ide next to the great body of the water, as they had no &s;u&s;picion of an attack from the other &s;ide. But as the &s;inking of the chevaux de-frize had ob&s;tructed the main current, and diverted the water into a new chan|nel, an American pilot undertook to carry a ve&s;&s;el of a certain draught of water, up the back &s;ide of the i&s;l|and; and a &s;hip of &s;ixty-four guns being cut down for the purpo&s;e, &s;he proceeded to the attack, while three &s;loops of war began to batter the fort in front, to di|vert their attention. The &s;tratagem &s;ucceeded: the &s;urprize of being attacked from a quarter they lea&s;t ex|pected it, and the want of time to remove their artillery to the other &s;ide, obliged them to &s;urrender, though not till after a &s;mart engagement, and a con&s;iderable

number had been killed on both &s;ides. Pa&s;&s;ing this memorable &s;pot, we in a &s;hort time made up to the much famed city of <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> This metropolis of the American States, has &s;o often been de&s;cribed, that I &s;hall be very brief in my account of it, and with this &s;hall conclude the pre&s;ent chapter.</P>
<P>Philadelphia is &s;eated between the rivers Delaware and Schuylkill. Its form is an oblong &s;quare, being two miles in length, and one in breadth. The prin|cipal &s;treet is in the centre of the city, and is one hun|dred and thirteen feet wide. Parallel to this, from north to &s;outh, run twenty-three &s;treets, cro&s;&s;ed by nine at right angles, all of them fifty feet wide. This is its original plan, laid out by William Penn; but the inhabitants, finding it more convenient for trade, have extended the buildings north and &s;outh on the river Delaware, far beyond this plan. In the mid&s;t of the city is a public &s;quare of ten acres, in the front of which &s;tands the State-hou&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here the account has been con&s;iderably &s;hortened, as has al&s;o that of &s;everal other places in America. The work was originally intended to have been publi&s;hed in Bri|tain, where a minute de&s;cription of Philadelphia would have been very acceptable; but here &s;uch de&s;criptions are fre|quently to be met with, and would prove unintere&s;ting in this place. Indeed, its elegant public and private buildings, numerous humane and u&s;eful in&s;titutions, places of wor|&s;hip, &amp;c. erected both before and &s;ince the peace, would far exceed our limits to detail.</NOTE>. The market place is the mo&s;t convenient and beautiful of any in America,

or perhaps in the world. It is extremely commodious, and is abundantly &s;upplied with all the nece&s;&s;aries and luxuries of life. The wharves are commodious, and ve&s;&s;els of five hundred tons burden can lie at them quite &s;ecure. The country above Philadelphia is well cultivated, and peopled with &s;ettlers from many Eu|ropean nations, particularly from Germany; the re|ligious per&s;ecutions of that country, having formerly induced many colonies to emigrate to this land of milk and honey; and as they are very indu&s;trious, and the &s;oil productive, they are every year enabled to export va&s;t quantities of grain to all parts of the world. The population of Penn&s;ylvania, and e&s;pecially of Philadel|phia, has had a more rapid increa&s;e than that of any other of the States, owing to the amazing multitudes which flock to it from Europe. Scotland and Ireland furni&s;h a very ample &s;hare. Many of the emigrants from the&s;e places are <HI>redemptioners,</HI> that is, they agree with the captain in their own country for a certain &s;um, to have a pa&s;&s;age to America; who carries them over, and if they can find any per&s;on upon their land|ing, to indemnify the captain, they agree to &s;erve their new ma&s;ter for a limited time, till the money he paid for them be made up. If they cannot find any &s;uch

them&s;elves, they are at the captain's di&s;po&s;al, till he can indemnify him&s;elf. The inhabitants are &s;ober, in|du&s;trious, and frugal, and of con&s;equence wealthy and &s;ub&s;tantial. As the country produces abundance of all kinds of materials and food, they have very few demands from abroad.&mdash;A Penn&s;ylvania farmer keeps but one table, at the head of which is placed his wife and him&s;elf, next to them their children, and at the foot of the table their &s;ervants place them&s;elves, who all &s;hare of the &s;ame food, and are entertained in the &s;ame manner as their ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s. Whether or not this kind of levelling behaviour be proper, I take not upon me to determine; but certain I am, no people in the world are &s;erved more faithfully, or obeyed more punctually.&mdash;The &s;ky is clear and &s;erene: the winter continues from December to March; the fro&s;t being often &s;o &s;evere as to freeze the Delaware over. In the months of July and Augu&s;t, the heat is &s;o inten&s;e, that in the year 1763, twenty per&s;ons drop|ped dead upon the &s;treets of Philadelphia <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This could only have happened by an imprudent u&s;e of cold water.</NOTE>.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ON the eleventh of June we left Philadelphia, and without any material accident arrived at Virginia. Before our arrival, our owner had determined to &s;end the ve&s;&s;el with a cargo to Spain: for which purpo&s;e e|very thing was got in readine&s;s, with all po&s;&s;ible expe|dition. July 9th, 1784, our &s;hip's company, con&s;i&s;ting of captain, mate, and &s;even men, received pay in ad|vance, at our merchant's hou&s;e, and took a part of our cargo on board at Alexandria&punc; from whence we were to proceed down the river Potomak to Dumfries, and take in the remainder. Our cargo con&s;i&s;ted of flour, fi&s;h, tar, and oil, with which we were to proceed to Ca|diz. Our &s;tay at Dumfries was &s;hort, as the cargo was in readine&s;s. Five other &s;hips lay at anchor here at this time; one from France, one from Gla&s;gow, and the other three from England. The &s;econd day after our arrival at Dumfries, I went on board the Gla&s;gow ve&s;|&s;el, where I &s;pent &s;ome time very agreeably with my
<PB N="78" REF="035035_0071_0FFFF594CFBAB008">
countrymen, who had &s;ome ca&s;ks of liquor for &s;ale, with &s;everal other articles which I &s;tood in need of, and ta|king them off their hands, I gave them tobacco in ex|change, of which I had a &s;mall quantity. On the fif|teenth we went a&s;hore, and laid in a plentiful allowance of fre&s;h &s;tock, &s;uch as pigs, turkeys, gee&s;e, and various kinds of poultry; and having obtained &s;tores of all kinds &s;ufficient for our voyage, we only waited for a fair wind to proceed to &s;ea. In the mean time, I had an opportu|nity of viewing this little town.</P>
<P>The town of Dumfries is, like many other of the A|merican towns, &s;till in its infancy. It is delightfully &s;it|uated, at the head of Quantico creek, and the country is clear of wood, to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the town. In the neighbourhood are many rich planters, who &s;end the greater part of their produce, to be &s;hip|ped at Alexandria, as the water &s;carcely ever ri&s;es to more than &s;even feet, &s;o that only &s;mall boats can get up to the town; con&s;equently, the trade of this place is incon&s;iderable; their principal traffic is in fi&s;h, of which they take great quantities, as they have nets and wiers placed in &s;uch a manner, as to make &s;ure of all that en|ter the creek. They will draw their nets two or three different times during an ebb, and are always &s;ure of a great draught. The drum fi&s;h and &s;turgeon are very plentiful here, as are al&s;o rock and perch. The noi&s;e of the drum fi&s;h to a per&s;on unacquainted with it, appears very &s;trange. A ve&s;&s;el once arrived here from Bermu|das,
<PB N="79" REF="035035_0072_0FFFF597D610C5F0">
and after getting a pilot on board, the captain went to take a little re&s;t, but he had not repo&s;ed long before a &s;hoal of the&s;e noi&s;y animals a&s;&s;embled about the bottom of the ve&s;&s;el, and began in their u&s;ual method to make a drumming and thumping, which exceedingly alarmed the captain; upon which he immediately flew to the deck, with many hearty imprecations on the pilot, for letting the &s;hip get a ground: nor could he be per&s;ua|ded that all was well, till he ordered one of the men to heave the lead overboard. The &s;turgeon is larger than our &s;almon, and has the large&s;t &s;cales of any other fi&s;h that ever I have &s;een, every one of them being about an inch in diameter.</P>
<P>Seven miles above this &s;tands the &s;eat of the great WASHINGTON, at a little di&s;tance from the river Po|tomak. It is &s;eated on a ri&s;ing ground, having an ea&s;y de&s;cent to the river, and is &s;urrounded by groves of trees, delightful gardens, and enchanting walks; and furni&s;hes a beautiful pro&s;pect from the river. To the cha|racter of the proprietor, who&s;e merits command the ad|miration of a world, my &s;lender tribute of prai&s;e can add nothing. If it be true, however, what &s;ome author &s;ays, that &s;ervants and near neighbours, are be&s;t qualifi|ed to give a man's real character, his will &s;uffer nothing from being brought to the te&s;t; for <HI>General Wa&s;hington,</HI> at the head of his army, or <HI>Pre&s;ident Wa&s;hington</HI> at the head of the American Congre&s;s, never commanded the admiration of the world in a greater deg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> than <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r|mer
<PB N="80" REF="035035_0073_0FFFF59B7887B9B8">
Wa&s;hington,</HI> on the banks of the Potomak, does the love and admiration of his neighbours and dependents. At the foot of an avenue, which leads from the hou&s;e to the river, is erected a fort, defended by twelve pieces of bra&s;s cannon: this during the war was manned by the general's own negroes, who had been carefully trained for the purpo&s;e. I &s;pent a day in viewing the re&s;idence of this truly great man, and returned very much plea&s;ed, that the contrary wind had afforded me &s;o good an opportunity.</P>
<P>On the &s;eventeenth, our captain's patience began to exhau&s;t, and he re&s;olved to tide it down the river. The fir&s;t tide we made Port-Tobacco creek, at the di&s;tance of eighteen miles. This creek, which lies on the Mary|land &s;ide of the river, is &s;even miles long, and naviga|ble for &s;mall ve&s;&s;els to the town of Port-Tobacco, which &s;tands at the head of it. Con&s;iderable quantities of tobacco, wheat, Indian corn, &amp;c. are annually exported from this creek, and va&s;t quantities of Briti&s;h, French, and Dutch manufactures are imported here. On the eighteenth we had a fine breeze of wind, which brought us as far as the cliffs of Noman, and on the nineteenth we got into the bay; but on a &s;udden the wind coming round, blew a hurricane, attended with thunder and lightening, and forced us to think of making for a port; and as Little-Yeockomaeo was at no great di&s;tance, we made for it with all expedition, and came to anchor about three o'clock. Here we lay till the twenty-fir&s;t, when the tempe&s;t abating, we hove up, and &s;tood down the
<PB N="81" REF="035035_0074_0FFFF59D065892A0">
bay, in company with the Congre&s;s, of Philadelphia, from Baltimore to France, laden with tobacco.</P>
<P>On the coa&s;t of America, this is generally the wor&s;t month in the year, for thunder and lightening, &s;udden gu&s;ts, whirlwinds, and water-&s;pouts; at pre&s;ent however, appearances were favourable, and we &s;tood to the ea&s;t|ward with a fine breeze. We kept company with the Congre&s;s till the &s;econd of Augu&s;t, when we were obliged to part, as &s;he was going more to the northward. At night it became almo&s;t calm, and the wind veering to the &s;outh-ea&s;t it began to blow and rain, accompa|nied with lightening, and tremendous peals of thunder. The gale increa&s;ed, and blew violently, and before we could get our &s;ails taken in we lo&s;t both our jib and fore|top-&s;ail. On the third it became more moderate, and the wind getting back to the &s;outh-we&s;t, permitted us to pur&s;ue our cour&s;e. The wind continued with us till the ninth, when according to our reckoning, we found our&s;elves in lat. 38&deg; north, longitude 39&deg; we&s;t; but at two o'clock a man at the fore-top-ma&s;t-head, called out <HI>land,</HI> when according to our captain's reckoning, there was no land within four hundred miles of us: upon going up the rigging, however, every one could plainly di&s;co|ver it, and lucky it was that we di&s;covered it in day light, as we were &s;teering right upon it, and mu&s;t have got on &s;hore in the dark. This land turned out to be the We&s;|tern-I&s;lands, or Azores; which lie between twenty-five and thirty-two degrees we&s;t longitude, and thirty &s;even
<PB N="82" REF="035035_0075_0FFFF59E90BC6898">
and forty degrees north latitude, nine hundred miles we&s;t of Portugal, and as many ea&s;t of Newfoundland.</P>
<P>The&s;e i&s;lands are nine in number; viz. Santa Ma|ria, St. Meguel, or Michael, Tercera, St. George, Gracio&s;a, Fayal, Pico, Flores, and Corvo. They were di&s;covered in 1439, by &s;ome Flemi&s;h &s;hips, and after|wards by the Portugue&s;e in 1449, who took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, and have hitherto retained them. They are extremely fertile, and &s;ubject to a governor, who re|&s;ides at Angra, in Tercera; where al&s;o a bi&s;hop re&s;ides, who&s;e dioce&s;s extends over all the i&s;lands, and who&s;e income, which is paid in grain, amounts only to two hundred pounds per annum. On each of the i&s;lands there is a deputy governor, and a judge in the law depart|ment, from who&s;e deci&s;ions an appeal may be had to the general court at Tercera, and from thence to the &s;upreme court at Li&s;bon. St. Meguel, the mo&s;t ea&s;terly, is the mo&s;t populous. In Pico, there is a remarkable promontoray, or peak, which in clear weather, may be di&s;cerned one hundred miles di&s;tant at &s;ea. The natives, like the Iri&s;h, have an opinion, that no &s;erpent or ven|emous animal will live in any of the&s;e i&s;lands, but will expire immediately upon their being landed. One tenth of all the productions of the Azores belong to the crown, and the article of tobacco, which is monopolized by it, brings a very con&s;iderable revenue. From eighteen to twenty thou&s;and pipes of the wine called <HI>Fayal,</HI> is an|nually made in the i&s;land of Pico, which is the large&s;t
<PB N="83" REF="035035_0076_0FFFF5A32203A058">
of all the&s;e i&s;lands; every pipe of which, when &s;old on the &s;pot, will bring the proprietor &s;even pounds &s;terling. The Azores are ble&s;&s;ed with a &s;alubrious air, though the violent earthquakes, which frequently happen, ren|der them but an unplea&s;ant re&s;idence.</P>
<P>Leaving the&s;e i&s;lands, we held on our cour&s;e without interruption till the twelfth, when we di&s;covered a cut|ter &s;tanding after us, and crowding all the &s;ail &s;he could to come up. The captain propo&s;ed lying too for her, but all hands oppo&s;ing the mea&s;ure, we crowded all the &s;ail we could, and altering our cour&s;e, we perceived that &s;he followed our example: we &s;u&s;pected her to be a pi|rate, and the &s;equel proved we were not mi&s;taken. A|bout four o'clock a breeze &s;prung up, and our &s;hip be|ing a very &s;wift &s;ailer, we &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of her. On the fourteenth we &s;poke with the Antonia, a Spani&s;h frigate of thirty-&s;ix guns, to whom we mentioned this cutter, who told us, he would u&s;e every endeavour to come up to her. Nothing material happened till the twenty-&s;eventh, when we got in &s;ight of the land, to the ea&s;tward of Cadiz, and though we came up to the light hou&s;e that evening, we did not choo&s;e to venture in till day light. Accordingly, on the morning of the twenty-eighth, we came to anchor in the bay, but were obliged to perform quarantine till the fir&s;t of Sep|tember, then we weighed and came to anchor again off the pier-end; when the captain went a&s;hore, and rela|ted to the governor, upon oath, the circum&s;tan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of a

pirate being in tho&s;e &s;eas. Several &s;hips of war were ly|ing in the harbour ready for a cruize, four of which were immediately ordered out in que&s;t of her. Another ve&s;&s;el arrived the &s;ame evening with intelligence, that they had &s;een her likewi&s;e, and had been &s;o near her as to di&s;cover that &s;he carried eighteen guns; but they had likewi&s;e out&s;ailed her. The &s;quadron ordered out, &s;ail|ed next morning.</P>
<P>September the third, we began to unload our car|go, and continued to di&s;charge till the &s;eventh, when our merchant ordered us to &s;top for a few days from unloading our fi&s;h, as he expected in a little time a much better price for them, the &s;uper&s;tition of the Spa|niards rendering it an article of general u&s;e. On the tenth, a &s;ignal for a fleet was made from the light|hou&s;e: they &s;oon reached the harbour, and proved to be the four ve&s;&s;els, ordered out in que&s;t of the pirate, with their prize along with them, in a very &s;hattered condition. They had fallen in with her on the &s;ixth, and upon &s;eeing them, &s;he had made all the &s;ail &s;he could to get away, but they had given cha&s;e and come up with her. When they hailed her, to know from whence &s;he came, &s;he told them &s;he came from Leg|horn, and was bound to Dunkirk. When the evening came on, they ordered her to keep clo&s;e by them during the night, which &s;he promi&s;ed to do; but notwith&s;tand|ing, &s;he made &s;everal attempts to give them the &s;lip. In the morning, when they found it impo&s;&s;ible to get
<PB N="85" REF="035035_0078_0FFFF5A742A75628">
away, they grew de&s;perate; and when the commodore ordered their captain on board, he flatly refu&s;ed, and told him, he would never &s;urrender &s;o long as he had a man able to fire a gun. A &s;mart engagement en&s;ued, in which the captain, mate, and &s;everal of the men, had paid for their ob&s;tinacy with the forfeit of their lives. They were at la&s;t obliged to &s;trike, and the &s;urvivers ordered on board the commodore, who gave the following account of them&s;elves, viz. That they belonged to Dunkirk, and having been un&s;ucce&s;sful by privateering during the war, they had determined at the clo&s;e of it, to try their fortunes in this manner. They had &s;ailed from Dunkirk in April 1783, and had been till then crui&s;ing in the Spani&s;h main, and taken &s;ome prizes; but before they left tho&s;e &s;eas, they thought proper to &s;ail towards the we&s;tern i&s;les, and try their fortune a little longer; after which they were to &s;ail for the north of Scotland, and run the ve&s;&s;el a&s;hore. It likewi&s;e appeared that the&s;e de&s;peradoes had taken &s;ome rich Portugue&s;e ve&s;&s;els from the Brazils, which they had plundered and &s;unk, putting their crews to death. No fewer than ten ve&s;&s;els, according to their own accounts, had fallen into their hands. When they left Dunkirk, they had on board one hundred and fifty men, commanded by a captain Dodd, a man about thir|ty-&s;ix years of age, who was born in Guern&s;ey; and the mate, they &s;aid, was a native of Ireland. Such was the account the pri&s;oners gave of them&s;elves. Ten of them &s;uppo&s;ed to be officers, were &s;ent to Madrid, to
<PB N="86" REF="035035_0079_0FFFF5A8CADE9BA8">
receive the reward of their demerits, and the re&s;t, &s;ixty in number, to the galleys. Upon &s;earching the ve&s;&s;el, goods and money were found to a va&s;t amount.</P>
<P>On the thirteenth, our captain and four of us went a&s;hore, and as the captain had bu&s;ine&s;s, that we knew would detain him &s;ome time, we agreed to go and &s;ee the fa&s;hionable amu&s;ement of Spain, a <HI>bull-fight,</HI> having heard there was to be a great entertainment of that kind, that &s;ame day. The place appropriated to this purpo&s;e, &s;tands at the out&s;ide of the town, and is of a circular form, and &s;eated all round for the accommodation of the &s;pectators. The charge at entrance depends upon the &s;eat, and like our theatres, the &s;eats are accommo|dated to the different ranks, for at this <HI>polite</HI> amu&s;e|ment all ranks attend. We paid a pi&s;treen each, (about eleven-pence &s;terl.) and took our &s;eats accordingly. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, a young cavalier has it in his power to recommend him&s;elf to his mi&s;tre&s;s by his prowe&s;s and &s;kill. In Britain, a man recommends him|&s;elf by the number of females he has ruined; but in Spain he recommends him&s;elf to his mi&s;tre&s;s, by the number of bulls he has killed. A young Spaniard be|comes the object of female notice, in proportion to the number and fiercene&s;s of the animals he has conquered; and is honoured, proclaimed, and rewarded accordingly. Previous to the combat, &s;ome pains and time are re|qui&s;ite to adju&s;t the weapons, and the manner of con|ducting it. The two-legged combatants take their
<PB N="87" REF="035035_0080_0FFFF5AD61831A00">
&s;eats in the centre, and with &s;eeming ea&s;e, loll on a ta|ble, and drink a gla&s;s of wine and &s;ugar; the qua|druped is led to the door, and immediately let loo&s;e a|mong them. They are generally prepared with darts, which if the bull &s;eems of a tame di&s;po&s;ition, they &s;tick in his &s;ides to rou&s;e him up, and enrage him to the ut|mo&s;t pitch; and having gained this point, they mount their hor&s;es or mules, armed with &s;words or &s;pears, and the battle begins. One bull frequently kills two or three hor&s;es, and wounds the rider in a &s;hocking man|ner; if he has agility enough he can prevent this, by getting into a hole made for the purpo&s;e, and while the bull is in pur&s;uit of one cavalier another combatant attacks him behind, to divert him from his object, and makes him face about. In this manner the combat is conducted, till &s;ome cavalier more lucky than the re&s;t, puts him to death, and receives the plaudits and accla|mations of the &s;pectators: after which the bull is carried to the market, and &s;old at a cheap rate to the poor; and as that cla&s;s of men are very numerous over all Spain, they are &s;ure to find plenty of cu&s;tomers. This is an amu&s;ement which a Spaniard doats upon, and I believe there is not a town of any note in all the king|dom, where there is not a hou&s;e or &s;quare &s;et apart for the purpo&s;e: Even in the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant villages, the inhabitants will enter into clubs, to procure an ox or bull, and fight them mounted upon a&s;&s;es, when a hor&s;e cannot be got: or rather than want the diver&s;ion, they will venture on foot. Their general fondne&s;s for this
<PB N="88" REF="035035_0081_0FFFF5AFEE21B910">
amu&s;ement, can only be accounted for from a cau&s;e al|ready mentioned, namely, procuring them a recommen|dation to the other &s;ex; for a &s;pirit of gallantry pre|vails much among them, and it is di&s;played in a more quixotical manner than in any other nation in Europe.</P>
<P>The I&s;land of Cadiz is about eighteen miles long, and nine broad at the one part of it; though it does not exceed one where the town &s;tands. Two forts guard the pa&s;&s;age into the harbour, the one called Puntal, and the other Malagorda. The town is &s;aid to have been fir&s;t built by the Phoenicians, and to have been afterwards po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Romans. Some Roman antiquities are &s;till to be &s;een on the i&s;land. It is a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, and has a communication with the continent by means of a bridge. The bay is twelve miles in length, and &s;ix in breadth. All the Spani&s;h ve&s;&s;els in the We&s;t India or American trade re&s;ort to this port, as al&s;o all trading ve&s;&s;els from every country in Europe. Though the town is rich, hand&s;ome, and populous, the country part of the i&s;land is extremely barren. There is not a drop of fre&s;h water to be &s;ound on it, nor any thing like agriculture to be &s;een. An Iri&s;h gentleman, who was at this time governor, had excited a &s;pirit of emulation in garden|ing. He had got a piece of ground walled in, col|lected manure to enrich it, and planted herbs, flowers, and fruit trees, which in a &s;hort &s;pace of time, had ar|rived at great perfection. In the year 1778, he began his work, and in the year 1782, he had a con&s;iderable
<PB N="89" REF="035035_0082_0FFFF5B1779E24D8">
produce of grapes, and other kinds of fruit; and in the year 1783, he had oranges in abundance. The gentlemen upon the i&s;land, fired by his example, began every one to enclo&s;e a &s;pot of ground, who could com|mand it; and this year, there was not le&s;s than twenty gardens in the neighbourhood of the town, all in great forwardne&s;s. Water is here a very &s;carce, and &s;ometimes a very co&s;tly article. It is all brought from the continent in boats, and the Levant winds frequently prevent them from pa&s;&s;ing for a con&s;iderable time. The town &s;tands on the we&s;t end of the i&s;land. The &s;treets are &s;o narrow, that two wheeled carriages can with difficulty pa&s;s each other in the broade&s;t of them; and till the pre&s;ent go|vernor came upon the i&s;land, they were always kept &s;hamefully dirty. The town is &s;urrounded by a wall, which is at the lowe&s;t parts of it twenty feet high, and in &s;ome places almo&s;t forty; the thickne&s;s of it, two thirds of the circumference, is from thirty to forty feet, and it is one entire battery. The pier is about two thou&s;and feet long, all built with large &s;quare &s;tones, and is about thirty feet wide. Here lie all the guard-&s;hips and boats, the &s;mall craft that trade to the coa&s;t of Barbary and the Mediterranean. In the wall are only two gates, by one of which people enter into the town, and by the other go out. Upon enter|ing, officers appointed for the purpo&s;e &s;trictly &s;earch them, if &s;trangers, for prohibited goods; and as no one is allowed to take Spani&s;h money out of the king|dom, people di&s;po&s;ing of their goods here, mu&s;t either
<PB N="90" REF="035035_0083_0FFFF5B305798CE0">
take goods in return, or bills of exchange. The mar|ket place is a large &s;quare, tolerably &s;upplied with beef, mutton, and veni&s;on, none of them of the be&s;t quality; but they have fi&s;h and poultry in the greate&s;t perfection. The inhabitants of Cadiz are a &s;trange mix|ture of French, Portugue&s;e, Italians and Moors, Iri&s;h adventurers and Engli&s;h &s;mugglers. Pride, lazine&s;s, and filth, are their characteri&s;ticks. They have much ex|ternal &s;anctity, and on &s;ome occa&s;ions are very devout. Here are &s;even churches, one of which has been up|wards of fifty years in building, and is not yet near fini&s;hed; it is of an octagonal form, and is about &s;ixty feet high, all built of a kind of marble. Upwards of five hundred clergymen, of different denominations, are in this town, many of them mendicant friars, who are more trouble&s;ome to &s;trangers, than our &s;treet beggars in England. I was one day acco&s;ted in Engli&s;h by a man well advanced in years, and upon entering into conver&s;ation with him, he told me he was a native of Leith, in Scotland; that at an early period of life he had come to Cadiz, in the capacity of a common &s;ai|lor; and that an old lady had taken a fancy to him, and found means to &s;ignify her wi&s;hes. That he had been induced to become Roman Catholic, and marry her; and that &s;he had left him in excellent circum&s;tan|ces. I ob&s;erved to him, that I had no objections to any part of his conduct but the change of his religion. "As to the matter of that, &s;ays he, I give my&s;elf no manner of trouble. I had made but &s;mall proficiency in
<PB N="91" REF="035035_0084_0FFFF5B5A5373CA8">
any religion when I came to this country, and had but little to renounce; and &s;o far as I can yet judge, two hundred per annum, which I received by my marriage, will make up for the difference between the two reli|gions." As I found we &s;hould not agree in our &s;entiments about religion, I wi&s;hed him good morning, and we parted.</P>
<P>September twentieth, our cargo being di&s;charged, we began to prepare for &s;ea; and taking in &s;ome &s;alt for balla&s;t, with &s;ome boxes of &s;ilk, and a few pipes of wine, we &s;et &s;ail on the 10th of October for the i&s;land of Teneriffe, where we were to take in the re&s;t of our cargo. But a dead calm prevented us from proceeding farther than the mouth of the harbour that evening. About three o'clock next morning, however, a gale &s;prung up, when we weighed anchor and &s;tood on our cour&s;e. At five o'clock, Cadiz light-hou&s;e bearing N. E. di&s;tant about three leagues, we di&s;covered a ve&s;|&s;el to windward lying too; who upon &s;eeing us, be|gan to crowd all her &s;ail and come down upon us. The captain had heard before we left Cadiz, of an Engli&s;h &s;hip lying off the harbour, and taking it for granted that this mu&s;t be her, he made not the &s;mal|le&s;t effort to get out of her way; on the contrary, as he had &s;ome particular me&s;&s;age to &s;end to England, he rather waited for her coming down. The &s;un was ri&s;|ing, and as &s;he was in a line between us and the ea&s;t, we could not make out her colours, till coming within
<PB N="92" REF="035035_0085_0FFFF5BA447B85A0">
gun-&s;hot, we received two &s;hots from her, and could plainly perceive Turki&s;h colours. We all in&s;i&s;ted up|on our captain to run, but by &s;ome &s;trange infatuation, he delayed it till we were totally in her power. We were ordered to hoi&s;t out the boat and go on board of her, which, though much again&s;t our wills, the captain, three other men, and my&s;elf, were obliged to do; and no &s;ooner had we &s;et our foot on board, than the cap|tain declared our &s;hip a prize, and our&s;elves pri&s;oners of war. We now, to our &s;orrowful experience, found our&s;elves in the power of a ma&s;ter, from whom we had nothing like mercy to expect. Slavery for life was all we could promi&s;e our&s;elves, and death alone could &s;et us free. With &s;uch pro&s;pects before us, my reader will ea&s;ily imagine, that this day, and many that &s;uc|ceeded, were mi&s;erable in the extreme.&mdash;As the &s;e|quel of our captivity will take many pages to relate it, I &s;hall re&s;erve it for another chapter.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE were now in the hands of &s;avages, belonging to a country where mercy was never &s;hewn to Chri&s;tians&mdash;doomed to we knew not what&mdash;to &s;uffer, perhaps, immediate death&mdash;to be re&s;erved for the mo&s;t deba&s;ing &s;pecies of &s;lavery&mdash;to drag out a life of un|tried mi&s;ery, far from our own country, where our friends could never more receive intelligence of our being in the land of the living. Alas! conjecture was vain; we dreaded the wor&s;t that could po&s;&s;ibly befall us, and the rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of di&s;mal apprehen&s;ions brought with it la&s;t complete &s;tupefaction.</P>
<P>They placed us upon the brea&s;t of the quarter deck, giving a negro the charge of watching us, while our captain, along with twelve of their men, went on
<PB N="94" REF="035035_0087_0FFFF5BF95854ED0">
board of our ve&s;&s;el. They &s;oon returned, bringing along with them our two mates: the re&s;t of our men they left on board the prize to navigate her, for the conducting of a brig was what they were unacquainted with them&s;elves, that being rather beyond the abilities of a Moor; and after giving &s;trict charge to the prize to keep company with us, they &s;et &s;ail for the coa&s;t of Barbary. Soon after, the boat&s;wain, or counterma&s;|ter, (as the word in their language &s;ignifies) along with two others, came up to us, and dive&s;ted us not only of every thing that was in our pockets, but of the pock|ets them&s;elves. They &s;tript us of all our cloaths that were good for any thing, and as the operation was la&s;t performed on me, I had rea&s;on to be convinced, that no &s;ituation is &s;o dreadful, that the pro&s;pect of immedi|ate death will not add to its horrors; for ju&s;t as they had &s;tripped off my handerchief from my neck, a fel|low of Herculean appearance, and a terrible counte|nance, came upon deck with a hatchet in his hand, and &s;tood for &s;ome time eyeing us with the mo&s;t <HI>Jack-Ketch</HI> like face I ever beheld in my life; and bad as my &s;ituation was, I confe&s;s I never felt greater plea|&s;ure, than when I &s;aw him, in&s;tead of applying his hatchet to our necks, take up a log of wood to &s;plit it for fuel. After we had got time to ruminate on our un|happy condition for about the &s;pace of an hour, the cap|tain acco&s;ted us, and talked to us for &s;ome time in his own language, which we neither under&s;tood nor at|tended to; at la&s;t the boat&s;wain beckoned us to follow
<PB N="95" REF="035035_0088_0FFFF5C221173CB8">
him, and taking us to his own apartment, pre&s;ented us with oil-olives and bread, neither of which could we ta&s;te; we were too full of grief to think of any kind of food, and the boat&s;wain having left us, we threw our|&s;elves upon the floor, and in the mo&s;t &s;orrowful accents bewailed our wretched condition.</P>
<P>Nature at la&s;t became exhau&s;ted, and all of us &s;unk down to &s;leep. This happy interval of care la&s;ted till morning, when we awoke, and found our&s;elves in a mo&s;t &s;hocking &s;ituation, being all covered over with vermin; but as the Turks had not left them many cloaths to take &s;helter in, we &s;oon di&s;engaged our&s;elves from &s;uch di&s;a|greeable companions, and went upon deck. We were anxious to &s;ee if our own ve&s;&s;el was &s;till in company, but &s;oon found &s;he was not in &s;ight. We were ex|tremely impatient to know what was become of her, but could not fall upon any method of receiving infor|mation, nor dur&s;t we &s;hew any anxiety about her, as we imagined our men, who were left on board of her, had been too many for the Moors, and carried her off to &s;ome other port, and we dreaded the con&s;equences that might re&s;ult to our&s;elves. At all rates we gave up the hopes of &s;eeing our companions again, and could not but regret the unlucky fate, that &s;ingled us out of all the &s;hip's company for &s;lavery, whil&s;t they, as we conjectured, were enjoying the &s;weets of liberty. The call of hunger is irre&s;i&s;tible, and now we began to feel it make powerful demands. We had ta&s;ted nothing
<PB N="96" REF="035035_0089_0FFFF5C3A7CBC268">
from the time we came on board; the boat&s;wain com|ing acro&s;s us, we made &s;igns to him for &s;omething to eat; he &s;et down the bread and oil-olives we had for|merly refu&s;ed, and I never remember to have made a more &s;ati&s;factory meal on roa&s;t beef and plumb pud|ding, though it was the fir&s;t time any of us had fed on &s;uch fare. Soon after the captain called us all on deck, and taking our mate by the hand, led him to the helm, and made a &s;ignal for him to &s;teer. After he had been at the helm about ten minutes, he made another take it, and &s;o on till he had tried us all. Finding us all better qualified than his own men, he gave us the charge of the helm, and became very kind to us, every now and then offering us food and tobacco. We &s;oon began to think our &s;ituation was not &s;o de&s;perate as we had at fir&s;t imagined, and by degrees became &s;omewhat better reconciled to our fate.</P>
<P>On the fourteenth we made the Barbary coa&s;t, to the &s;outhward of Salee, and &s;tanding to the northward all that day, we came up to the port of Larache, to which port we were bound. We were obliged to come to anchor, as no ve&s;&s;el can enter this port but upon one tack, it being exceedingly narrow, and the entry con|fu&s;ed. On the &s;ixteenth, however, we got into port, not without &s;ome danger of the &s;hip's being da&s;hed to pieces by the un&s;kilful management of the Moori&s;h &s;ailors. As &s;oon as we came to anchor, the captain and &s;ome of the other officers went a&s;hore. Two of our
<PB N="97" REF="035035_0090_0FFFF5C63935A910">
number projected a &s;cheme of running away with the boat, which we might ea&s;ily have accompli&s;hed, but for the &s;econd mate, who had a brother on board the prize, and as we did not know for certain that &s;he had got clear of the enemy, the mate re&s;olved at all events to &s;tay and &s;hare his fate. The &s;ucce&s;s he &s;aid was uncer|tain, and &s;hould we &s;ucceed, he dreaded that his bro|ther's life might pay the forfeit. As we could not bring him to our mind, therefore, we re&s;olved unanimou&s;ly to &s;ubmit to our fate, whatever it might be, with fortitude. The port of Larache is &s;ituated in north lat. 35&deg; longi|tude 7&deg; we&s;t of London. When we entered the port, we were &s;aluted by a fort with nine guns, which com|pliment was returned with &s;ix. The entrance into this port is extremely narrow, in&s;omuch that two &s;hips can|not pa&s;s each other. On the one &s;ide is a low point or neck of land, which forms a &s;emi circle, in which is a ba&s;on or harbour, which perhaps might contain one hundred &s;ail of &s;hips, though there are &s;eldom in it at one time above five or &s;ix, which, together with two which con&s;tantly lie at Mogodore, form the whole of the Moori&s;h navy, and excepting one ve&s;&s;el which mounts twenty-&s;ix guns, not one of them carry more than &s;ixteen. The town of Larache is defended by this &s;mall battery of nine guns, already mentioned. It is of a &s;quare form, with a wall round it, having two gates in each &s;quare</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="035035_0091_0FFFF5CA00316870">On the nineteenth in the morning, we were put into the boat and ordered to go on &s;hore. As &s;oon as we were got &s;eated in the boat, the &s;hip fired all her guns, and when we reached the &s;hore, we found the governor, with all the officers and &s;oldiers of the fort, ready to receive us. They were in number about &s;ix hundred, all under arms. The governor and officers were all mounted on fine Arabian hor&s;es, and led the van in a kind of proce&s;&s;ion, which was immediately begun. The crews of the &s;hips which were in the harbour, formed a circle round us. They were again &s;urrounded by the military. If we &s;eemed objects of wonder to them, they were no le&s;s &s;o to us. For what purpo&s;e we were thus guarded, we could by no means conjecture. For a|bout 100 yards we marched &s;lowly on, the multitude in a kind of mu&s;ical tone crying out, <HI>Laca laca la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e fide Mahomed;</HI> or, "Long live king Mahomed." Af|ter this we made a full &s;top, when they opened the ranks, and twelve men with loaded mu&s;kets in their hands, pointed to our faces, came running up to us with an intention, as we imagined, to blow out our brains; when they came within two yards of us, they lowered their pieces, pointing them to the ground, and fired them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> before our feet; the&s;e fell back, and other twelve performed the &s;ame ceremony, and &s;o on, till all tho&s;e in front of us had done the &s;ame thing, after which they all turned their faces <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the ea&s;t, and in a very devout manner offered up ejaculatory prayers. They led us all round the town, making a full &s;top, and pray|ing

at each of the gates, till we arrived at the gate we &s;et out from, when the &s;oldiers opening to the right and left, lined on each &s;ide the pa&s;&s;age to the governor's hou&s;e, and we were marched up between the ranks till we came to the governor, who with &s;everal other great men, was &s;tanding in the outer court, before his own door. He &s;at down when we approached him, cro&s;s|legged, as the Moori&s;h cu&s;tom is, having only a kind of mat or &s;opha &s;pread underneath him; and an interpre|ter being called, he, with great dignity in his manner, began to que&s;tion us; and as we did not know but he was going to pa&s;s &s;entence of death upon us immedi|ately, we made rather an aukward appearance. The following dialogue pa&s;&s;ed between us. Of what coun|try are you? We an&s;wered from America. What kind of a country is America? A woody country. What is your religion? but I &s;uppo&s;e you wor&s;hip the trees. We an&s;wered we were Chri&s;tians. Are you connected with England? Our country is principally peopled from thence. Is the king of England your king? No, but he lately was. Why is he not now? He now gives us leave to govern our&s;elves. How do you like this country? It is a very good country. Will you embrace our religion, and prevent your&s;elves from being &s;laves? We are not yet acquainted with it. After putting a number of &s;imilar que&s;tions, he a&s;ked us, If we would eat any thing? We told him we were very hungry; up|on which he ordered each of us a piece of bread, and ri&s;ing with great &s;tateline&s;s, walked into the hou&s;e.
<PB N="100" REF="035035_0093_0FFFF5CE17646740">
Immediately we were led to a jail, with the portion of bread a&s;&s;igned us in our hands, and here, if we had no other comfort, we had at lea&s;t the uninterrupted &s;ociety of one another. The jail in which we were lodged was dark, dirty, and every way uncomfortable. We did not &s;ee a human face till late in the evening of the day in which we entered it, when a man made his ap|pearance, bringing us a di&s;h in great e&s;timation in that country, called <HI>cu&s;co&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.</HI> It is made of flour, wet in the manner we do it to make bread; after which they rub it between their hands, till it forms it&s;elf into &s;mall portions like barley corns, they afterwards &s;pread it on the bottom of a pot, made on purpo&s;e with holes in it. Underneath it they flew a fowl, mutton, or beef, with onions, pepper, &s;alt, and a pumpkin, the &s;team of which gives a nice reli&s;h to the &s;mall particles above, and make them very delicious. They were delicious at this time, to us all at lea&s;t, and we made a very comfortable meal; after which the keeper took away the di&s;hes, and care|fully locked the door. We then began to look about for beds, but nothing of that kind being to be found, we &s;tretched our&s;elves on the cold &s;tones, and &s;lept as well as our cares would let us. Next morning a man entered with a cake for each of us, and a &s;mall portion of butter and honey, which he &s;et down and di&s;appear|ed. We made an excellent breakfa&s;t of this delicious fare, not without thanking Providence, that our treat|ment hitherto had &s;o much exceeded our expectations. At noon the &s;ame per&s;on entered the pri&s;on with ano|ther
<PB N="101" REF="035035_0094_0FFFAE7BCD5AC320">
di&s;h of cu&s;co&s;oo, and placing it upon the floor, withdrew to the door. We had never &s;een either a knife or &s;poon, and when he was gone, we began to look a|bout for a piece of wood to make &s;omething to an&s;wer our purpo&s;e as a &s;ub&s;titute. We began to &s;plit it, when the jailor appeared and made &s;ignals for us to eat our victuals. We gave him to know what we wanted. He took up the di&s;h, and gathering up a handful, threw it into his mouth, giving us to under&s;tand that this was the method of eating it. We could by no means reconcile our&s;elves to this method, and with a great degree of ob&s;tinacy, more than prudence, per&s;i&s;ted in preparing our wooden &s;poons, upon which he ordered our provi|&s;ions to be taken away, and we neither received any more vi&s;its from him, nor any more food during the re|mainder of that day.</P>
<P>Next morning, after pa&s;&s;ing a night of complete mor|tification, we received from a beautiful young woman, a vi&s;it upon &s;piritual bu&s;ine&s;s. She was, it &s;eems one of the &s;aints, or enthu&s;ia&s;ts of that country, who had given up the plea&s;ures of the pre&s;ent world, with a view of preparing her&s;elf and others, for the enjoyments of the next. She had in her hands a piece of bread, which when &s;he had &s;pit upon &s;he divided among us, and we were very glad to &s;ee it, and devoured it greedily. Af|terwards &s;he wet her fingers with her &s;pittle, and rubbed our temples, frequently breathing upon us as &s;he did it. She had brought a negro as an interpreter, who told us,
<PB N="102" REF="035035_0095_0FFFF5D22F4541E0">
&s;he wanted to make us pro&s;elytes to the religion of Maho|met, and that all the ge&s;tures and ab&s;urdities &s;he prac|ticed, were done with this view. She made him pro|mi&s;e us great honour and preferment, both in this world and the next, if we would acknowledge and embrace the religion of the prophet; but finding us ob&s;tinately determined to adhere to our own faith, &s;he gave us up for lo&s;t, and went away greatly di&s;appointed. During all this day we got nothing to eat, we had indeed plenty of tar water, and that was all our drink. Next morn|ing a man coming in, brought us each a &s;mall cake, not much larger than a &s;ea-bi&s;cuit, and left about a farthing's worth of tobacco, to be divided among&s;t us. Night came on without bringing us any more vi&s;its or victuals; and next morning the &s;ame man entered, bringing us the &s;ame quantity of bread, and at the &s;ame time gave to under&s;tand this was to be our daily allowance. We had the liberty of five rooms, and in one of them, we had with chalk, made an imitation of a chequer-board, on the floor, and cutting &s;ome corks into &s;mall pieces, amu&s;ed our&s;elves in the be&s;t manner we could, by play|ing at this game.</P>
<P>This morning we agreed to re&s;erve the half of our cakes till the evening, and left them behind when we went to our game. Whil&s;t we were amu&s;ing our&s;elves with this diver&s;ion in another room, the guard, who had us in charge, came into the one which we had left, and made off with the remainder of our cakes, which
<PB N="103" REF="035035_0096_0FFFF5D6EF2342C0">
we had pre&s;erved for our evening's repa&s;t. This there|fore, was a mi&s;erable day with us, and to add to our grief, we had to &s;uffer cold in the extreme, for it was now the mo&s;t inclement &s;ea&s;on of the year, and as I al|ready ob&s;erved, we had been &s;tript of all our cloathing that was worth taking. The little we had left was all over vermin, and next morning we were obliged to re|&s;erve the water that was brought us to drink to wa&s;h our &s;hirts: after which we cut off our hair to prevent them from finding &s;helter among it, &s;o that the figure we cut was truly ridiculous. On the twenty-fifth our &s;econd mate, who was naturally of a very happy di&s;po|&s;ition <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gan to &s;ing, and all the re&s;t of us fell to dancing. This brought a great a&s;&s;emblage of Moors to &s;ee us per|form. Our woe-worn faces excited compa&s;&s;ion in &s;ome, who brought us bread <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tobacco. We tried the &s;ame experiment for &s;ome days with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s, but they &s;oon became accu&s;tomed to it, and by its loo&s;ing the charm of novelty, it cea&s;ed to produce any good effects.</P>
<P>Thus we were obliged to drag out a mi&s;erable exi&s;|tence till the twenty-ninth of November, when the go|vernor gave orders to have us taken out to get a little fre&s;h air, and this day, for the fir&s;t time, we received accounts of the re&s;t of our crew. A caravan had ju&s;t arrived from Tangiers, and one of the men who guard|ed it, came to us, and in broken Engli&s;h began a con|ver&s;ation, in the cour&s;e of which we learnt, that the
<PB N="104" REF="035035_0097_0FFFF5D98553F3E0">
prize had been carried in there &s;ometime before, that the re&s;t of the crew were all to be &s;ent here in a few weeks, when we were to go to Morocco, and be kept pri&s;oners, till the United States &s;hould &s;end over an amba&s;&s;ador to make a treaty of alliance with the em|peror. The only comfort we derived from this intel|ligence, was the hope of &s;eeing our companions: as to gaining our liberty, the pro&s;pect was as di&s;tant as ever, for it was uncertain when the Congre&s;s would &s;end an amba&s;&s;ador to Barbary, or whether one might ever be &s;ent. Patience is a cure for all di&s;tempers, to this, therefore, we were forced to have recour&s;e, and leave the event to the Supreme Di&s;po&s;er of all.</P>
<P>On the twelfth of December, the &s;ame female devo|tee, who had vi&s;ited us before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gain made her appear|ance, bringing with her two others of her own &s;ex, and the &s;ame negro interpreter. She began to anoint our temples in the &s;ame manner as before. They then buf|fetted us with their hands, and each of them pulling out a &s;hort dagger, threatened as if they meant to &s;tab us, and, at every interval, made the negro a&s;k us, if we were yet willing to embrace the religion of Mahomet. When they found their threats ineffectual, they began to coax, flatter, and promi&s;e, and made u&s;e of every argument they could &s;ugge&s;t, with as much earne&s;tne&s;s as if their own &s;alvation had depended on their &s;ucce&s;s. They told us, if we complied, we would immediately be re|&s;tored to liberty, that we would be advanced to honour and
<PB N="105" REF="035035_0098_0FFFF5DB0D6F9EF8">
dignity in the country, and receive from the hands of the emperor, the mo&s;t beautiful wives. This la&s;t argu|ment they repeated &s;o earne&s;tly and &s;o often, as convin|ced us, they thought it one of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings that could be conferred. Finding us ob&s;tinate, they left us to our own meditations.</P>
<P>The next day a me&s;&s;age was &s;ent to me from the captain who had taken us pri&s;oners, to go to his hou&s;e. He had, it &s;eems, laid up his ve&s;&s;el for the winter, and as he expected to go to Morocco, he wanted to have &s;ome tents in readine&s;s, to &s;helter him and his men du|ring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> long and tire&s;ome journey. The rea&s;on of my being &s;ent for, was, that I might give him &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance in fini&s;hing them, having ob&s;erved me when at &s;ea, &s;ewing &s;ails with more dexterity than his own men. I was obliged to obey the order, not without &s;ome apprehen&s;ions, as I was not made acquainted with his intentions till I went to the hou&s;e. When I arrived I was obliged to &s;top in an outer court, till they ap|prized him of my coming, and got the women all put out of the way; for they will not &s;uffer them either to &s;ee Chri&s;tians, or be &s;een by them. I was at length permitted to enter, when the captain, who was an old man, received me with a &s;miling countenance, &s;itting upon a &s;traw matra&s;s. He a&s;ked me in Spani&s;h, to &s;it down. I knew a little of that language, and was glad to hear him &s;peak it. He then told me the bu&s;i|ne&s;s he wanted me to perform; and accordingly I en|tered
<PB N="106" REF="035035_0158_100019B5CEFDEBD0">
upon my ta&s;k immediately. I had not been long at work, when the captain &s;ent me a di&s;h of maca|roone and milk, and after I had fini&s;hed my day's la|bour, he again &s;ent me two cakes to carry with me to the jail. The&s;e I accepted with a joyful heart, happy to be the in&s;trument of a &s;mall relief to my fellow|&s;ufferers. On the twentieth of December our work was fini&s;hed, and I was remanded back to my con|finement.</P>
<P>On the twenty-&s;econd, we were allowed to take an airing on a ri&s;ing ground between the town and the &s;ea, where we had a mo&s;t delightful pro&s;pect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> both. In a little time we perceived two ve&s;&s;els crowding all the &s;ail they could, the one flying and the other pur|&s;uing, and heard the report of &s;everal guns. Next day we learned from &s;ome fi&s;hermen, that they were a Spani&s;h merchantman and an Algerine crui&s;er; that the latter had been for two days in chace of the former, but that a breeze of wind had luckily &s;prung up, and enabled her to make her e&s;cape. In our return to our pri&s;on, we were met by the governor, who a&s;k|ed us by an interpreter, how we liked his country, and that if it was not the be&s;t we had ever &s;een? We told him we liked it much; though our hearts gave the lie to our tongues, for in our &s;ituation, paradi&s;e it&s;elf would have been di&s;agreeable. He de&s;ired us to make our&s;elves as happy as we could, and &s;aid he hoped all would be well. We returned to our pri&s;on, and in a
<PB N="107" REF="035035_0099_100019C7D44FDC10">
&s;hort time the governor &s;ent us about one pound of to|bacco, which was a very acceptable pre&s;ent, as our &s;canty allowance of food required &s;uch a &s;ub&s;titute. In this country, acorns and nuts of all kinds are very plentiful, and extremely large, and for &s;ome days we had a &s;lender relief from the children, who threw hand|fuls of the&s;e in at our windows, and entertained them|&s;elves by &s;eeing us &s;cramble for them in a very raven|ous manner. Had we not been &s;upported by good con|&s;titutions, and &s;tout hearts, we mu&s;t inevitably have &s;unk under the extreme cold and hunger we were for|ced to undergo, for all the cloathing we could mu&s;ter among &s;ix of us, was not &s;uffic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">t for the comfort of two; but we danced to keep our&s;elves warm, we chewed tobacco to allay our hunger, and we comforted our&s;elves with the reflection, that whatever might be our future fate, we could not well be wor&s;e.</P>
<P>On the twentieth of January, we were informed, that our me&s;&s;mates were on their way from Tangiers to join us, and that we were all to be &s;ent off to Mo|rocco, by a caravan, which was &s;oon to leave this place. The thoughts of this journey almo&s;t di&s;tracted us. At this &s;ea&s;on of the year it blows the mo&s;t dreadful hurri|canes in Barbary, attended with thunder, lightning, and rain; and accoutred as we were, it was likely to be a very uncomfortable journey, through a de&s;ert country, without the conveniency of an inn to re&s;t or refre&s;h at.
<PB N="108" REF="035035_0100_1000196323DE9630">
We ca&s;t many a wi&s;hful look towards the &s;hore, never expecting after our removal to &s;ee it again.</P>
<P>On the twenty-fifth we were made happy by the &s;ight of the captain and the re&s;t of the crew, and whil&s;t we were recounting to one another the hard&s;hips we had undergone &s;ince we parted, an order was &s;ent for us to appear before the governor. He de&s;ired us to hold our&s;elves in readine&s;s, for next morning the cara|van was to &s;et out for Morocco, and we mu&s;t go along with it. We returned to our pri&s;on; but as hor&s;es and mules could not be got in the morning, we were obli|ged to put off our journey to another day. During this day our captain wrote a letter to the American con&s;ul at Cadiz, which all of us &s;igned, acquainting him with our captivity, and pre&s;ent circum&s;tances and pro&s;|pects; and reque&s;ting him to apply to the Congre&s;s, to take mea&s;ures in our behalf. The con&s;ul, who&s;e name was Mr. Harri&s;on, was part owner of our brig, and upon receiving our letter, he took the readie&s;t me|thod of relieving our nece&s;&s;ities, by &s;ending fifty dol|lars; which the captain afterwards receiving, applied it to his own purpo&s;es, without giving us any &s;hare of it; a conduct which was the more unpardonable, as his folly had been the original cau&s;e of all our misfortunes.</P>
<P>On the morning of the twenty-&s;eventh, at an early hour, a va&s;t concour&s;e of men and women, hor&s;es and mules, were a&s;&s;embled in the &s;treet, oppo&s;ite to our
<PB N="109" REF="035035_0101_100019694F25CAD8">
place of confinement. The governor, the captain of the &s;hip which had captured us, with &s;everal officers of inferior rank, came into the pri&s;on, and a&s;ked us what we thought of an excur&s;ion through the country as far as Morocco; and without waiting for an an&s;wer, they ordered us out, and mounted us upon camels, when our march began for the city of Morocco, and we bade adieu to Larache, with hearts full of anxiety and grief.</P>
<P>The caravan con&s;i&s;ted of about two hundred hor&s;e-guards, &s;eventy camels, and thirty mules. The fir&s;t day we travelled about twenty miles, when we came to a valley called Zedith, and pitched our tents for the night. The form of our encampment was this: The grand ba&s;haw, who commanded in chief, pitched his tent in the middle, and all the other tents, to the num|ber of thirty, were pitched in a circle round him, at a little di&s;tance. The provi&s;ions, baggage, &amp;c. were brought into the centre, and the cattle let loo&s;e to feed. One half of the &s;oldiers mounted guard, and during the night patrolled round the tents, calling out every now and then in their own language, "All is well." About four o'clock next morning, we &s;truck our tents, and were ready by five to continue our march, which we did till about ten, when coming to a &s;pring of water, (an invaluable luxury in this country) we &s;topped to refre&s;h our&s;elves and hor&s;es. After we had received our &s;mall portion of bread, which was &s;oon di&s;patched, we began to look out for &s;ome wild fruit. About one
<PB N="110" REF="035035_0102_1000196B009D3618">
hundred yards from the road, we e&s;pied a little grove, and two of the &s;oldiers accompanying us, we found it produce grapes, pomegranates, figs, and oranges, but only the la&s;t were ripe. We took as many along with us as we could carry, and found them of infinite &s;ervice to us upon the road. Joining the calvacade, we con|tinued our march, and that night halted at a place called <HI>Mo&s;&s;ata,</HI> which is named after a &s;aint of that name, who lived and was murdered here, as it is &s;aid, and to who&s;e memory a tomb is erected. Next morn|ing we &s;tarted at the u&s;ual hour, and travelled through a delightful country, exceeded perhaps by no part of the globe. At every little interval we pa&s;&s;ed a grove, where all &s;orts of delicious fruits grew wild, and invi|ted us to ta&s;te; and cattle, &s;heep and hor&s;es were &s;cat|tered all over the plains. This evening we pitched our tents by the &s;ide of a wood: we did not &s;tart next morning till &s;even o'clock, and by twelve we reached Mamora, a &s;mall town, one hundred and fifty miles north of Salee, con&s;i&s;ting of about one hundred hou&s;es, and defended by a &s;mall fort of &s;ix guns. Pa&s;&s;ing this place, we arrived about &s;ix in the evening at Zeriff, a river which takes its ri&s;e in the kingdom of Fez, and empties it&s;elf into the we&s;tern ocean. The banks of this river abounding with all &s;orts of ferocious animals, &s;uch as lions, tygers, leopards, and wolves, it was judged improper to form an encampment here, on account of &s;uch dangerous neighbours; we therefore marched on five miles farther, till we came to a &s;mall plain, where
<PB N="111" REF="035035_0103_1000196EE9EEE8B8">
we pitched our tents till next morning. At nine o'clock, we again &s;et out, and about ten came to a place called Fedela, where the foundation of a fortre&s;s was laid &s;ome|time &s;ince by Sidi Mahomed the reigning emperor, but on account of a war breaking out between him and his &s;on, it never was fini&s;hed. We travelled on till five in the evening, when we came to the only fre&s;h water lake in all that country. Its water has a ta&s;te &s;omewhat like our Engli&s;h Spa-waters, owing to the va&s;t quantities of &s;alt-petre, with which the country abounds. It is only about a mile and a half in circumference, and a|bounds with a variety of fi&s;h. We had &s;een many large flocks of &s;heep in our journey, but I never in all that country &s;aw a &s;hepherd, but upon the &s;ide of this lake. Here, however, they think their flocks worth the tend|ing; and their mode of living deviates as little from the original &s;implicity of nature, as the manners of the &s;hep|herds in the patriarchal ages.</P>
<P>On the morning of the thirty-fir&s;t, being heartily ti|red of riding on the camels, we obtained leave of our guards to walk for &s;ometime, and entertained our&s;elves running after the amazing &s;warms of rats, which over|&s;pread all the country. Their numbers are incredible, and one rea&s;on for their amazing increa&s;e may be the mode of thra&s;hing corn practi&s;ed here. After it is out down and bound into &s;heaves, they let it &s;tand for a few days, after which they lay down the &s;heaves in a circular form, in the field where it grows, and tying two hor&s;es
<PB N="112" REF="035035_0104_1000197195EDD888">
together, lead them round and round, till they tread the grain totally from the &s;talk; after which they dig a pit, into which they throw the grain, which owing to the dryne&s;s of the &s;oil, is &s;afely pre&s;erved till they have ac|ca&s;ion to take it up. The rats therefore can find food in every field, and con&s;equently re&s;ort but little to the habitation of man. We frequently met them in large bodies, &s;ome of them of an enormous &s;ize. They &s;tood &s;urveying as with great compo&s;ure, &s;hewing as little dread of us, as we did of them. When their re&s;ources fail in one field, they will travel in thou&s;ands to ano|ther; for like the inhabitants of the country, they are every where at home where grain is to be had.&mdash;At five o'clock this evening we arrived at a valley, called Kora, where finding water, we filled our pitchers, and got each a large &s;upply of excellent fruit, and after travelling &s;even miles further, we pitched our tents. Next day we travelled through a country, beautiful beyond de&s;|cription. For this garden of the world, nature has done every thing; and yet a Briton, accu&s;tomed to arts and indu&s;try, could not but behold it with an eye of commi&s;eration. Not le&s;s than two thirds of the land lies wa&s;te, unoccupied, and uncultivated. A law|le&s;s banditti occupy the mountainous parts of the country, who prey upon the indu&s;trious inhabitants, carry off their cattle, de&s;troy their grain, and often leave behind them dreadful traces of brutal ferocity, by murdering whole families or villages. Happy is the

<P>On the morning of the &s;econd of February we a&s;|cended a hill, where we had a view of Salee and Rabat, and about eleven o'clock we came to the river Guero, on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore of which &s;tands Rabat.

<P>Ba&s;haw Zeriff, commander of the caravan, ordered the camels and mules we had brought with us, to be &s;ent back, and fre&s;h ones to be got at Rabat to carry us forward the re&s;t of the journey. We began to &s;end over all our baggage and provi&s;ions, and as there was only two pa&s;&s;age boats, it was evening before we all got landed on the other &s;ide. None of our party had ta&s;ted food during the day, and had we not had a few oranges in our pockets, we mu&s;t have peri&s;hed with hunger and fatigue.</P>

<P>After we had cro&s;&s;ed the river, we entered the town of Rabat. Among other &s;pectators who were pre&s;ent at our landing, was the Sardinian con&s;ul, a native of France, who had for &s;ome time re&s;ided <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">re. As &s;oon as he di&s;covered us to be Chri&s;tians, he ha&s;tened to meet us, bringing with him a Jew interpreter. He fir&s;t &s;poke to us him&s;elf, in French; but as we could not an&s;wer him in that language, the interpreter told us, he a&s;ked what countrymen we were? We gave him a brief detail of
<PB N="115" REF="035035_0107_0FFFF5DC951CDC88">
our country and misfortunes, and as we did it, his eyes were moi&s;tened, and he could not refrain from dropping a tear. He told us, he &s;incerely &s;ympathized with us, and wi&s;hed he could a&s;&s;i&s;t us, but was &s;orry he had &s;o lit|tle in his power; what he could do, he told us, he would, and in the mean time we &s;hould be his gue&s;ts; for which purpo&s;e he would &s;olicit the ba&s;haw. This was the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian face we had &s;een in this country, and his looks, manner, and kind expre&s;&s;ions, had &s;o much of the phil|anthropi&s;t, that we were convinced he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a warm benevolent heart. He left us not a little &s;urprized and plea&s;ed with his generous offer, and went to the ba&s;haw, who readily complied with his reque&s;t. He then came up to us, took us &s;everally by the hand, and de&s;ired us to follow him to his hou&s;e. We &s;et out for the habitation of our benevolent friend, and were &s;hewn into an elegant apartment, ragged and dirty as we were, where a plentiful &s;upper was &s;et before us of different kinds of meat, with a variety of fruit, and two large flagons of wine. This was the fir&s;t time we had it in our power to eat a hearty meal in the country, and we indulged appetites, long unaccu&s;tomed to indulgence, with rather too much freedom; for in a &s;hort time every one of us began to be racked with pains, &s;o that we could neither &s;peak nor keep upon our &s;eats. Our kind enter|tainer &s;oon came to a&s;k how we liked our &s;upper, when he found &s;ome of us &s;prawling on the floor in the utmo&s;t agony. He a&s;ked the captain if we had wanted food long before, and being told the truth, he
<PB N="116" REF="035035_0108_10001979A21A9B28">
pre&s;cribed a bumper or two of brandy to each of us, which &s;oon had the de&s;ired effect, and re&s;tored us to tranquility and ea&s;e. Our &s;tay at Rabat was prolonged to four days, owing to a &s;carcity of camels, and during all that time did this generous man entertain us in the &s;ame &s;umptuous manner. He gave us many friendly advices re&s;pecting our conduct in this country; in par|ticular he begged us to be cautious of having the &s;mall|e&s;t intimacy or connection with the Moori&s;h women, whatever advances they might make to us, as the laws of their country made it death to any Chri&s;tian, found intriguing with them, and the Moors certainly would avail them&s;elves of this privilege. We did not fail to ob&s;erve his precaution during our re&s;idence. in this country. One day our benevelent ho&s;t (who devi&s;ed every method he could to &s;weeten our &s;tay with him) propo&s;ed to entertain us by a country walk, and taking us along with him, we pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;treets to the gate, the croud &s;taring at us like wild bea&s;ts all the way. He led us to the top of a mount, by an ea&s;y a&s;cent, where &s;tands a fortification, if one may give it the name, of very little &s;trength. Here we had a view of the town and the mo&s;t enchanting country I ever be|held&mdash;its wall all one garden. The mo&s;t delicious fruits of all kinds every where pre&s;ented them&s;elves. In &s;hort, did the indu&s;try of the inhabitants, in any de|gree, &s;econd the bountiful hand of nature, this country would be the garden of the world. We pulled as much fruit as we could conveniently carry, and bring|ing

it home, our landlord, after dinner, made each of us drink a bottle of wine to help to dige&s;t it. But our happine&s;s here was too complete to be of long duration. On the evening of the fourth day, captain Rice Ham|mond, paid us a vi&s;it and told us, we were to march next morning. All the remaining part of that even|ing, did the worthy con&s;ul &s;pend in our company, mak|ing u&s;e of every argument his imagination could &s;ugge&s;t to cheer our drooping &s;pirits: he told us, he was cer|tain we would not long be &s;laves, but as he a&s;&s;igned no rea&s;on for his a&s;&s;ertion, we imputed it to his good na|ture only. He often expre&s;&s;ed his wi&s;h he could &s;peak Engli&s;h, which made us imagine he had &s;ome &s;cheme for our emancipation, which he dur&s;t not impart through the medium of an intepreter. We left our kind enter|tainer next morning with a tear of gratitude in each of our eyes. But his kindne&s;s was not limited to the time of our &s;tay with him; he had got prepared for us four large pots, full of boiled meat, five gallons of wine and one of brandy, together with &s;ixty pound weight of bread, and each a pound of tobocco.</P>
<P>After this gentleman's behaviour, no man &s;hall ever per&s;uade me, that di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence is not a plant of this world, nor that any country is &s;o barren that it will not produce it. Full of gloomy thoughts and dreadful apprehen&s;ions, on the eighth of February, we entered again upon our hopele&s;s journey. Our ig|norance of the language of our companions made every
<PB N="118" REF="035035_0110_0FFFF5E3E06BFCE0">
enquiry fruitle&s;s re&s;pecting our future fate. We had &s;till one half of our journey to perform, and whether it &s;hould terminate in liberty or &s;lavery, life or death, we were totally ignorant. The fir&s;t night we reached a plain, twenty-four miles from Rabat, where we pitch|ed our tents; as the wind was ea&s;terly that evening, we were much infe&s;ted with va&s;t &s;warms of locu&s;ts, who flew about our ears, making a kind of humming noi&s;e. I had the curio&s;ity to kill &s;everal of them, and exa|mine them minutely. They are generally from two to three inches long, their head re&s;embling that of a hor&s;e: they have four feet, and a tail gradually taper|ing to the end. They are of a greeni&s;h colour, inter|mixed with &s;treaks of black and brown: they have a near re&s;emblance to the larger kind of our beetles in &s;ize and form. The following night we pitched at Ar|bodia, &s;aid to have been once the fine&s;t town on the coa&s;t, but a war breaking out between the emperor and his brother, the army of the latter laid it in rains. It con&s;i&s;ted of three hundred hou&s;es, and now there is not one left &s;tanding to &s;hew where the town &s;tood. Euro|pean ve&s;&s;els u&s;ed to trade to this port for grain, but &s;ince the de&s;truction of the town, the harbour is totally de&s;erted. Still however a great number of families re&s;ort here, at certain &s;ea&s;ons of the year, for the a|mu&s;ement of fi&s;hing, hunting, &amp;c. It is like our water|ing places in England, a place of fa&s;hionable re&s;ort, and at this time a va&s;t number of tents, were erected, and an incredible number of people had come to enjoy the
<PB N="119" REF="035035_0111_0FFFF5E5688EDBB8">
amu&s;ements of the country. Immediately after we had pitched our tents, a young man of a very graceful ap|pearance, with &s;omething in his air and manner above the common rank, came out of a tent, followed by a great retinue. Ba&s;haw Zeriff Hammond no &s;ooner e&s;|pied him, than he ha&s;tily made up to him, and ki&s;&s;ing the ground before him, &s;oon gave us to under&s;tand that he was &s;ome very great per&s;onage; and in a little we learned that he was &s;on to the emperor. He took a walk round all the tents of the caravan, in company with the ba&s;haw, and the captain of the &s;hip who had taken us, &s;urveying us with a very inqui&s;itive eye, and a&s;king a number of que&s;tions, as we imagined, at the captain.</P>
<P>We had the greater part of the gallon of brandy we brought from Rabat &s;till with us, and though we knew the Alcoran &s;trickly prohibits the u&s;e of &s;piritous liquors, yet as we had &s;een Rice Hammond u&s;e them with the greate&s;t freedom, we de&s;ired him to offer a gla&s;s of our brandy to the prince. He did &s;o, and it was accepted with plea&s;ure. By this time he had &s;ent for an interpreter, who fell down before him, and ki&s;|&s;ed the ground. He a&s;ked us how we liked the coun|try, and whether it was not the be&s;t we had ever &s;een? We told him we only wanted liberty to make us think it &s;o. He then de&s;ired the interpreter to inform us of his rank, and of his connection with, and friend&s;hip for the Engli&s;h. The interpreter then proceeded to inform
<PB N="120" REF="035035_0112_1000197D776A1C88">
us, that he was the favourite &s;on of the reigning em|peror, by an Engli&s;h woman. About thirty years ago, &s;ays he, a number of Engli&s;h &s;hips were ca&s;t a&s;hore on the coa&s;t of Barbary, the crews of which were all ta|ken up by the emperor, who having &s;o many Briti&s;h &s;ubjects in his power, took occa&s;ion to declare war again&s;t that nation. He marched them all to Morocco, and made &s;laves of the men, expecting them to be ran|&s;omed at a high rate. Among the unfortunate &s;uffer|ers, was a beautiful female, whom the emperor no &s;oon|er beheld, than &s;he entirely gained his affections. He ordered her to be &s;ent to the &s;eraglio, and for many years, her good &s;en&s;e, and una&s;&s;uming behaviour, main|tained the conque&s;t which her beauty had gained. By that lady the emperor had this prince, who is generally expected to &s;ucceed him on the throne. The emperor, who has between eighty and ninety &s;ons, &s;hews a great|er degree of fondne&s;s for him, than for any of the re&s;t; and as he is a very great favourite in the empire at large, the emperor's declaration in his favour will be highly reli&s;hed, and warmly &s;upported by every indi|vidual in the country. We gave the interpreter thanks for his intelligence, and paid our re&s;pects to the prince in the Engli&s;h manner; who de&s;ired the interpreter to tell us, that he looked upon every Engli&s;hman as his friend, and that he &s;hould be happy to have it in his power to be of &s;ervice to us; upon which he left the tent, and we found means to detain the interpreter for a little, wi&s;hing to receive every po&s;&s;ible information
<PB N="121" REF="035035_0113_0FFFF5EA9365CE18">
re&s;pecting our future de&s;tination. He told us, if this prince &s;hould ever come to the throne, the Engli&s;h might a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves of the be&s;t treatment from him; that it was happy for us we were in the power of his father, who, he &s;aid, was a very humane prince, and that if we had been taken by a &s;ubject of the dey of Algiers, our fate would have been much harder. When you go to Morocco, &s;ays he, you will not have much work, if you have any, and I am per&s;uaded the em|peror will not &s;ell you to any other ma&s;ter. Perhaps he will grant you your liberty at once. It is fortunate for you that you have &s;een his &s;on, who it is more than probable will intercede for you; at all rates, endea|vour to make your&s;elves happy, and whatever your &s;entiments may be, let your looks be cheerful.</P>
<P>We parted with the interpreter, and &s;ome of our number could recollect the circum&s;tance of the Litch|field man of war being ca&s;t on that coa&s;t, in the year 1755, together with &s;everal tran&s;ports, on an expedi|tion to the i&s;land of Goree. This corroborated the &s;tory we had heard, and convinced us, that the fair &s;ul|tana mu&s;t have been one of the adventurers in that un|fortunate expedition. Before we went to &s;leep, (bed we had none &s;ince we left our own ve&s;&s;el) the prince paid us another vi&s;it, in company with the ba&s;haw, and cap|tain Rice Hammed, and giving them &s;trict charges to be kind to us on our journey, he bade us adieu. Next morning at &s;even o'clock, we began our march, and
<PB N="122" REF="035035_0114_0FFFF5F0B9FD1F90">
pa&s;&s;ed through a country extremely fertile; we came to a valley, between two hills, where we e&s;pied a great number of huts, inhabited by a very &s;avage-looking race of people. The day following we entered a very &s;pacious plain, named Zebra, about nine o'clock in the morning; and when we &s;topped in the evening, we were &s;even miles on the other &s;ide of it. It is from ca&s;t to we&s;t thirty miles long, and twenty-five broad from north to &s;outh. On the &s;outh &s;ide of it runs the river of Lions, &s;o called from the va&s;t number of tho&s;e animals that re&s;ort to the banks of it. We dur&s;t not go nearer than within &s;even miles of this river, to form an encampment, as they generally go abroad in the night to hunt for their prey. We were informed, that near two years before this period, about twelve fa|milies lived on the plain, at no great di&s;tance from each other, and that one evening, an a&s;&s;emblage of wild bea&s;ts came down, and de&s;troyed upwards of &s;ixty cam|els, a great number of &s;heep, and two or three of the pea&s;ants. We had to cro&s;s part of the fore&s;t in the day time, and even then were alarmed with the roaring of lions, the barking of wolves, and the &s;creaming of leo|pards and tygers. The &s;oldiers however were all on on their guard, and nothing appeared to mole&s;t us but one wild boar, which was in&s;tantly &s;hot. On the thir|teenth, about ten o'clock, we reached the plain of Mo|rocco, and could di&s;cover the cloud-capt Atlas, at a very great di&s;tance, terminating this immen&s;e plain on
<PB N="123" REF="035035_0115_0FFFF5F249E7B4A0">
the &s;outh. From this much famed mountain, or rather chain of mountains, the Atlantic ocean takes its name.</P>
<P>The va&s;t plain upon which we now entered, is ninety miles long and forty broad. On the north it is bounded by a chain of very high hills, called the Valena mountains, and on the ea&s;t by a part Egypt. In the middle, be|tween the mountains of Atlas and Valena, &s;tands Mo|rocco, the capital of this va&s;t empire. We encamped about five miles from the city, at four in the afternoon, when di&s;patches were &s;ent to the emperor, to inform him of our arrival. Next day about ten o'clock we received orders to enter the gates of the city, and were marched through the &s;treets, in the mid&s;t of an innu|merable crowd of &s;pectators, till we came to one of the emperor's gardens, where we were ordered to pitch our tents till the emperor's further orders were received. We lodged here for that night, anxious for the light of another day, on the event of which every thing that was dear to us depended. The important day at length arrived, and at eleven o'clock, a guard of &s;oldiers came into the garden, and gave orders for us to march. We pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal divi&s;ions of the garden, and came to the &s;ide of it next the palace, where was a &s;quare of about two miles in circumference, in which were rang|ed &s;ome thou&s;ands of &s;oldiers, all under arms. Old captain Rice Hammed, with the other officers of his ve&s;&s;el, marched in our front. Here we were detained for the &s;pace of an hour, without exchanging a word
<PB N="124" REF="035035_0116_0FFFF5F86CEF4FA8">
with any one; till at la&s;t the old captain came and told us, that the &s;ignal for the emperor's appearance would be a camel drove out before him, that the army might be in readine&s;s to receive him. In the middle of this large area, was a &s;ummer &s;hade, beautifully painted and adorned, to which the emperor frequently re&s;orts, to review his troops; and round this were planted all the cavalry. The camel at la&s;t made its appearance, and was followed by the monarch, riding in a two-wheeled chariot, drawn by four Arabian mules of a jet black co|lour. He was followed by a body guard, con&s;i&s;ting of about one hundred men, who be&s;ides their arms, were furni&s;hed each with a &s;tick in his hand. He moved &s;lowly along, &s;urveying every thing with a quick, pen|etrating eye; the army at every little interval, calling out in their own language, "Long live the emperor Mahomed." When he came to the di&s;tance of about twenty yards from us, the chariot &s;topped, and about twenty of the footmen came running toward us, and each of them taking one of us by the hand, led us forward, together with the Turki&s;h &s;ailors; the cavalry at the &s;ame time contracting the circle, and coming as near as they could: when we came to the di&s;tance of about &s;even yards, all the foot guards and Moors of every de|nomination, who were in the park, fell down upon their knees, and ki&s;&s;ed the ground three times. We paid our compliments in the manner of our country, by un|covering our heads, and bowing very profoundly. The emperor, who &s;eemed to have his eyes con&s;tantly fixed
<PB N="125" REF="035035_0117_1000197EF9562960">
on us, returned our compliment with a &s;mile, which we (who watched his looks with no &s;mall degree of anxi|ety) interpreted as a good omen. An interpreter was called, who a&s;ked us, of what country we were, and and of what religion? where we were bound to when we were taken? and what was our cargo? Our captain who was chief &s;peaker, told him, we were from Amer|ica, that we had landed a cargo in Spain, and were hound to Teneriffe, when we were taken. He a&s;ked us, if we did not belong to the Briti&s;h government? We told him we belonged to that part of America, which had become independent of Britain? How happens it, &s;ays he, that your nation have not &s;ecured my friend|&s;hip before you attempted to come upon my coa&s;t? To this (as we knew not what to an&s;wer) we were totally &s;ilent. The interpreter then, by his order, a&s;ked if we would conform to the religion of the country? To which we an&s;wered, Our con&s;ciences would not allow us. He did not &s;eem to re&s;ent our an&s;wer, and the in|terpreter, a Mr. Chapman, who was a native of Genoa, and agent to the emperor, afterwards told us, he would have de&s;pi&s;ed us heartily if we had given him any other an&s;wer. I do not mean, &s;ays the emperor, to treat you with &s;everity; the power I have over you &s;hall not be abu&s;ed: you &s;hall not be &s;old to another, nor kept in a &s;tate of &s;lavery by my&s;elf; but I mu&s;t detain you in my country till I &s;ee whether your nation choo&s;es to &s;end an amba&s;&s;ador to enter into a treaty with me: you may retire, and I &s;hall give orders to the proper per&s;ons to

di&s;po&s;e of you. We left his pre&s;ence, and retired to to our fir&s;t &s;tation, where we &s;tood till we &s;aw the em|peror ride round the park, and return to the palace. No &s;ooner was he gone than Mr. Chapman, the inter|preter, came to us, and congratulated us upon our fa|vourable reception, and the mildne&s;s of our &s;entence. I have orders, &s;ays he, to prepare a hou&s;e for you, to &s;upply you with food and other nece&s;&s;aries, and I &s;hall endeavour to make your &s;tay in Morocco as plea&s;ant as your &s;ituation will admit. We returned our warme&s;t acknowledgments to this gentleman for his proffered kindne&s;s, and bidding adieu to old Rice Hammed, and the re&s;t of the crew, we followed our leader with exalt|ing hearts. He led us out of the gardens, and brought us to a hou&s;e, which, he &s;aid, had formely been a ma&s;s hou&s;e for the Spaniards, in which were &s;everal apart|ments. He made an apology for leaving us for a little, telling us, he would return immediately. And now, for the fir&s;t time, we began to recollect that none of us had eaten a mouthful that day, and to be anxious for Mr. Chapman's entering upon the benevolent part of his of|fice. He &s;oon returned, followed by a Jew, carrying a large ba&s;ket full of bread, and a pot of butter, mak|ing many excu&s;es for having nothing better to offer us, and a&s;&s;uring us we &s;hould have plenty of beef next day, with coals and uten&s;ils for cooking. After this he &s;ent for a pound tobacco, and di&s;tributed it among us, and then left us to our own meditations.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="035035_0119_10001984554AE998">We now gave way to the mo&s;t abounded joy; we had anticipated our reception at Morocco with horror, but how very different was our pre&s;ent &s;ituation from what we expected.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN every part of this empire there are va&s;t numbers of Jews, who have a quarter of every town &s;et apart for their re&s;idence. In the city of Morocco, they are very numerous, and are extremely u&s;eful to the Moors, e&s;pecial in money tran&s;actions, and accounts. A Moor is generally too indolent, or too little informed to tran&s;act his own bu&s;ine&s;s. A Jew in this, as in all other countries, is &s;hrewd, cunning, and well ver&s;ed in the management of bu&s;ine&s;s; and renders him&s;elf nece&s;&s;ary to a rich African, too fond of ea&s;e to mind his own concerns.

and in&s;ulted, without daring to complain, or &s;eek for redre&s;s.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e allotted to us &s;tood in the Jewi&s;h quar|ter of the city, or as it is called, the <HI>Jews'-town,</HI> and we were allowed to a&s;&s;ociate with them at plea&s;ure. We found them extremely ready to cultivate our ac|quaintance, and oblige us in &s;mall matters that co&s;t them nothing. We had likewi&s;e permi&s;&s;ion to walk through every part of the city, Mr. Chapman giving us the &s;ame caution the Sardinian con&s;ul had formerly done, re&s;pecting the Moori&s;h women. The ninth night of our re&s;idence in our new habitation, we eat our &s;upper and went to &s;leep; but we had not been long gone to re&s;t, when we were rou&s;ed by a very loud rapping at the gate, which continued &s;o long that we were forced to get up and enquire what it meant. In&s;tead of going to the gate, however, we went up to the hou&s;e|top, where we di&s;covered not le&s;s than twenty Moors, &s;tanding and calling out for admittance. We dread|ed they had &s;ome evil de&s;ign again&s;t us, and returning to our apartment we found a large log of wood, which we laid at the back of the door, to prevent their breaking it open. They continued knocking for the &s;pace of an hour, but at la&s;t finding they could obtain no an&s;wer, they retired. They had ob&s;erved us on the top of the hou&s;e, and two of them had, by &s;ome means or other, got into the yard; for after we ima|gined they were gone, one of our number opening the
<PB N="130" REF="035035_0122_0FFFF605292B0C18">
door, and offering to go up the &s;tairs which led to the top of the hou&s;e, was &s;uddenly &s;eized by them. He called out for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and we all immediately went up to him, &s;eized the Moors, and taking them to our own apartment, detained them till day-light. Mr. Chapman, who made his appearance at an early hour, was not a little &s;urprized to find we had made two pri|&s;oners; and enquiring into the bu&s;ine&s;s we gave him a brief account of their behaviour. He immediately or|dered them to be carried to the pre&s;ence of the empe|ror, who made them give up the names of their ac|complices, and Mr. Chapman told us, they were all immediately ba&s;tinadoed with great &s;overity, as a warn|ing to others, not to di&s;turb us for the future. This however, was an unlucky accident for us; it created us many &s;ecret enemies; we could &s;carcely walk through any &s;treet in the city without being in&s;ulted, and even the Jews, from a de&s;ire of plea&s;ing the Moors, did us every injury in their power. We &s;uffered, without complaining, as long as we could, but were at la&s;t for|ced to make our ca&s;e known to Mr. Chapman, who immediately reported the matter to the emperor. The emperor told him he would order us to be &s;ent to Mo|godore in a few days, where we could live unmole&s;ted, and enjoy the &s;ociety of Europeans and Chri&s;tians, of whom a great number are &s;ettled there.</P>
<P>Previous to our departure, Mr. Chapman obtained liberty for us to vi&s;it all the curio&s;ities of this large city,
<PB N="131" REF="035035_0123_10001989A87C0F38">
and appointed a guard of Moors to protect us from in|&s;ult. Our fir&s;t excur&s;ion was to &s;ee the emperor's col|lection of wild bea&s;ts, which is I &s;uppo&s;e the large&s;t in the world. The place in which they were kept, is very &s;pacious. On the right hand were lions, wolves, tygers, cats, bears, &amp;c. on the other &s;ide were a col|lection of tame bea&s;ts, with a great variety of fowls of various kinds. I was much &s;truck with the appearance of the antelope, which I &s;uppo&s;e, has been called the unicorn, for that animal is not now at lea&s;t to be found in the world, and this in &s;ome re&s;pects re&s;em|bles what it is &s;aid to be, particularly in its having a horn right in the middle of its forehead. It is of a light brown colour, &s;omewhat re&s;embling the deer of this country. The antelope of Barbary is con&s;iderably &s;maller than that of the &s;outh of Africa or Egypt. One of the latter country was likewi&s;e in this collection, which was of a delicate grey colour, dark on the back, but gradually becoming lighter towards the belly. The horn is in general five or &s;ix inches long. It would take a volume to de&s;cribe the great variety of animals contained in this collection. I &s;hall not therefore at|tempt it, but proceed to our next day's entertainment.</P>
<P>We aro&s;e in the morning, and directed our cour&s;e towards the &s;eraglio, but our guards were particularly cautious of allowing us to approach it. This large building or &s;quare, is &s;urrounded by a wall of fourteen feet high, and is inacce&s;&s;ible to all but the emperor and
<PB N="132" REF="035035_0124_0FFFF60DDD5EE7D8">
his emi&s;&s;aries. We were told it contained near one thou&s;and per&s;ons, but I do not &s;uppo&s;e the man from whom we received our information, could by any means a&s;certain the number.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The place where the emperor's women are kept is cal|led the HAREM, and forms a part of the palace, or &s;eraglio. LEMPRIERE, in his tour to Morocco, lately publi&s;hed, has giv|en a particular account of this place. He was &s;ent by the gov|ernor of Gibraltar, in 1789, as phy&s;ician, to attend Muley Ab&s;ulem, a favorite &s;on of the late emperor, at the particu|lar reque&s;t of that prince, who&s;e health was on the decline. While at Morocco, waiting the emperor's di&s;patches to re|turn home, he was called to attend one of his principal &s;ul|tanas, who was labouring under the effects of a do&s;e of poi|&s;on, admini&s;tered to her by &s;ome of her jealous companions. The admi&s;&s;ion of an European, and one of the male &s;ex, into the Royal Harem, is a thing, we believe, unprecedented; but whatever induced the emperor thus to violate Moori&s;h decorum, it enabled the writer to furni&s;h the world with a particular account of this &s;eat of ea&s;tern debauchery; of which we &s;hall pre&s;ent a brief ab&s;tract.</P>
<P>"The public and u&s;ual entrance to the Harem," &s;ays Lempriere, "is through a very large arched door-way, guarded on the out&s;ide by ten body guards, which leads to a lofty hall, where the captain or alciade, with a guard of &s;eventeen eunuchs, are po&s;ted. Upon entering the court into which the women's apartments open, I di&s;covered a motley group of concubines, dome&s;tics, and negro &s;laves, who were variou&s;ly employed. Tho&s;e of the fir&s;t de&s;cription had formed them&s;elves into circles, &s;eated on the ground in the open court, and were apparently engaged in conver&s;a|tion. The dome&s;tics and &s;laves were chiefly employed in preparing their cu&s;co&s;oo. My appearance in the court &s;oon attracted their attention, and a con&s;iderable number of them, unacquainted with the means by which I had been admitted into the Harem, retreated with the utmo&s;t precipitancy; while others, more courageous, approached, and enquired of my black attendant, who I was, and by who&s;e orders he had brought me thither. The moment it was known that I was of the medical profe&s;&s;ion, parties of them were di&s;patched to inform tho&s;e who had fled, that I was &s;ent in by order of the emperor, to attend Lalla Zara, [Lady or Mrs. Zara] my intended patient's name, and reque&s;ting them to come back and look at the Chri&s;tian. Seranio Tibib! Chri&s;tian Doctor! re&s;ounded from one end of the Harem to the other; and in the cour&s;e of a few minutes I was &s;o completely &s;ur|rounded by women and children, that I was unable to move a &s;ingle &s;tep. Every one of them appeared &s;olicitous to find out &s;ome complaint on which &s;he might con&s;ult me, and tho&s;e who had not ingenuity enough to invent one, obliged me to feel their pul&s;e; and were highly di&s;plea&s;ed, if I did not di&s;co|ver &s;ome ailment or other. All of them &s;eemed &s;o urgent to be attended at the &s;ame time, that while I was feeling the pul&s;e of one, others were behind pulling my coat, and en|treating me to examine their complaints, while a third par|ty were upbraiding me for not paying them the &s;ame attention. Their ideas of delicacy did not at all corre&s;pond with tho&s;e of our European ladies, for they exhibited the beauties of their limbs and form with a degree of freedom that in any other country would have been thought indecent; and their conver&s;ation was equally unre&s;trained." But in this "they were not con&s;cious of tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing the limits of decency." This was evident on other occa&s;ions, "wherein they mani|fe&s;ted a &s;ingular attention to what they conceived to be de|corum;" for "when I reque&s;ted to &s;ee the tongues of &s;ome patients who complained of feveri&s;h &s;ymptoms, they refu&s;ed to comply, con&s;idering it as incon&s;i&s;tent with their mode&s;ty and virtue.</P>
<P>"From the fir&s;t court into which I had been introduced, I pa&s;&s;ed through two or three &s;imilar, till I arrived at the chamber of my intended patient. I found the lady &s;itting cro&s;s-legged on a mattre&s;s placed upon the floor, and cov|ered with fine linen, with twelve white and negro attendants, &s;eated on the floor al&s;o, in different parts of the chamber. A round cu&s;hion was placed for me next to the lady, on which I was de&s;ired to be &s;eated." He then proceeds to give &s;ome account of his patient, who a few years previous to this, had been remarkable for her beauty and accompli&s;hments; on which account &s;he was then in every re&s;pect the favorite wife of the emperor. This exciting the jealou&s;y of tho&s;e who&s;e charms were le&s;s con&s;picuous, they had effected her ruin by mixing poi&s;on in her food, which, though not &s;ufficiently &s;trong to take away her life, had completely de&s;troyed that beauty, which had been the fatal cau&s;e of her misfortune. After which, being &s;trongly &s;olicited, he vi&s;ited &s;everal other ladies, in their own apartments, though at a con&s;iderable ri&s;k, and without the knowledge of the emperor. Mo&s;t of the&s;e were exceedingly corpulent, which they con&s;ider as a mark of beauty, and u&s;e various means to attain. Some of them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed con&s;iderable accompli&s;hments, and were po|lite and attentive in their behaviour. One of them, from her being able to read and write well the Arabic language, was con&s;idered by the other females as a &s;uperior being.</P>
<P>"The apartments," continues he, "which are all on the ground floor, are &s;quare, very lofty, and four of them enclo&s;e a &s;quare court, into which they open by means of large folding doors. In the centre of the&s;e courts, which are floored with blue and white tiling, is a fountain, &s;upplied by pipes from a large re&s;ervoir on the out&s;ide of the palace, which &s;erve for the frequent ablutions recommended by the Mahometan religion, as well as for other purpo&s;es. The whole of the Harem, con&s;i&s;ts of about twelve of the&s;e &s;quare courts, communicating with each other by narrow pa&s;&s;ages, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> acce&s;s from one part of it to another, and of which all the women are allowed to avail them&s;elves. The apartments are ornamented with beauti|ful carved work, much &s;uperior to any I have ever &s;een in Europe. Mo&s;t of the rooms are hung with rich dama&s;k of various colours; the floors are covered with beautiful car|pets, and there are mattre&s;&s;es di&s;po&s;ed at proper di&s;tances, for the purpo&s;es of &s;itting and &s;leeping. The apartments are al&s;o furni&s;hed at each extremity with an elegant European mahogany bed&s;tead, hung with dama&s;k, having on it &s;everal mattre&s;&s;es, placed one over the other, which are covered with various coloured &s;ilks; but the&s;e are merely to orna|ment the room. Some of the rooms were garni&s;hed with large and valuable looking-gla&s;&s;es, hung on different parts of the walls. In others, clocks and watches of different &s;izes, in gla&s;s ca&s;es, were di&s;po&s;ed in the &s;ame manner;" with a variety of other ornaments. "The whole Harem was under the management of the principal &s;ultana, with|out any particular control over the other woman.</P>
<P>"Each female had a &s;eparate daily allowance from the emperor, proportioned to the e&s;timation in which they were held by him." This allowance was exceeding &s;mall; there|fore their chief dependence was "on the pre&s;ents they re|ceived from tho&s;e Europeans and Moors who vi&s;ited the court, and who employed their influence in obtaining &s;ome particular favour from the emperor.</P>
<P>"The ladies &s;eparately furni&s;h their own rooms, hire their own dome&s;tics, and, in fact, do what they plea&s;e in the Harem, but are not permitted to go out without an expre&s;s order from the emperor, who very &s;eldom grants them that favour, except when they are to be removed from one pa|lace to another. In that ca&s;e a party of &s;oldiers is di&s;|patched a little di&s;tance before them, to di&s;per&s;e the male pa&s;&s;engers in particular, and to prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of their being &s;een. This previous &s;tep being taken, a piece of linen cloth is tied round the lower part of the face, and afterwards the&s;e mi&s;erable females cover them&s;elves entirely with their Haicks, and either mount mules, which they ride like men, or, what is more u&s;ual, are put into a &s;quare carriage, or litter, con&s;tructed for this purpo&s;e, which by its lattice work allows them to &s;ee with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> being &s;een. In this manner they &s;et off under the charge of a guard of black eunuchs. This journey, and &s;ometimes a walk round the bounds of the palace, is the only exerci&s;e they are permitted to take.</P>
<P>"The emperor's Harem con&s;i&s;ted of between &s;ixty and a hundred female, be&s;ides their dome&s;tics and &s;laves, which were very numerous." However it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved here, that the number of females frequently change, &s;ome dying, and others being repudiated. The emperor only vi&s;ited the Harem occa&s;ionally: It was "u&s;ual for him to give no|tice to tho&s;e ladies who&s;e company he wi&s;hed, to attend in his apartment; when they made a point of &s;etting off their charms to the be&s;t advantage. In his pre&s;ence they &s;hewed him every attention which a common &s;lave would do to his ma&s;ter, and never attempted to offer their opinion, except by his approbation.</P>
<P>"The dre&s;s of the ladies con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;hirt, with re|markably full and loo&s;e &s;leeves, hanging almo&s;t to the ground, the neck and brea&s;t of which are left open, and their edges are neatly embroidered with gold. They wear linen draw|ers, and over the &s;hirt a-Caftan, which is a dre&s;s &s;omething &s;imilar in form to a loo&s;e great coat without &s;leeves. A &s;a&s;h of fine linen or cotton is tied gracefully round the wai&s;t, and its extremities fall below the knees. To this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> two broad &s;traps are annexed, and pa&s;&s;ing over each &s;houlder, form a cro&s;s on the brea&s;t, and to that part of it which pa&s;&s;es between the brea&s;t and &s;houlder of each arm is fixed a gold tortoi&s;e, carele&s;sly &s;u&s;pending in front a gold chain. Over the whole is extended a broad &s;ilk band of the Fez manufacture, which &s;urrounds the wai&s;t and completes the dre&s;s, except when they go abroad, and then they inve&s;t them&s;elves in a carele&s;s manner with the Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ck.

<P>Next morning we took a view of the &s;outh &s;ide of the city, which overlooks a rich exten&s;ive plain, that appears a dead level, till Atlas ri&s;es and terminates the pro&s;pect. This plain, which extends, as I already ob|&s;erved, from Morocco to the Atlas mountains, twenty miles, is but thinly inhabited, and the rea&s;on of this is, a numerous banditti of Arabs, outlawed, and di&s;affected per&s;ons, have, time immemorial, inhabitated the moun|tainous part of the country The&s;e were, &s;ometime be|fore this, headed by one of the emperor's &s;ons, who wanted to dethrone his father, and a&s;&s;ume the govern|ment.

It is therefore dangerous for any family to think of liv|ing in the country, and this is one rea&s;on why &s;o much of this beautiful empire is totally de&s;erted. We had taken &s;ome refre&s;hment in our pockets this day, and wandering into the country a con&s;iderable way, we did not think of returning home till the evening. It was almo&s;t dark when we entered our habitation, when we were alarmed by the violent &s;creams of a woman. We in&s;tantly made towards her, a&s;king what was the matter? She begged us, in Spani&s;h, to give her a knife; we did &s;o, and &s;he no &s;ooner received it, than &s;he cut the back of her hand, acro&s;s, till it bled violently. We attempted to hold her, and to &s;top the blooding, but &s;he begged us to let her alone, telling us, &s;he had been bit by a &s;corpion, and there was no other way of ea&s;ing the pain.

She told us, they never ventured out of their lurking places till it was dark, but that &s;he could ea&s;ily convince us &s;he had told us the truth, if one of us would get the lamp lighted. We did &s;o, and &s;he pointed out &s;ev|eral holes, into which we pu&s;hed our &s;ticks, when &s;eve|ral i&s;&s;ued forth, which we took care to kill as &s;oon as they made their appearance. We killed ten &s;corpions, and two &s;nakes, the latter from two to three feet long. The knowledge we had gained of our <HI>fellow-lodgers,</HI> made us afraid of &s;leeping in the hou&s;e, though we had done it often before with no bad effects: We therefore went upon the hou&s;e-top, and &s;lept in the open air, and this we continued to do every night, during our re&s;idence at Morocco.</P>
<P>Though the bite of the &s;corpion is often almo&s;t in&s;tant death, yet the precaution of this young Jewe&s;s, who was as &s;en&s;ible as &s;he was beautiful, prevented the poi|&s;on from taking effect. After having &s;carified her hand, &s;he bound up her arm very tight, which pre|vented the poi&s;on from circulating upwards, and in a|bout &s;even days &s;he was entirely freed from its effects, and the wound healed.</P>
<P>It is indeed &s;hocking to &s;ee this great city, the capi|tal of a va&s;t empire, &s;o dreadfully over-run by all &s;orts of venemous animals. It pre&s;ents to an European eye, a painful pro&s;pect, to look at a great metropolis, nearly

<P>The city of Morocco is built nearly &s;quare, inclo&s;ed by a wall, which, if po&s;&s;ible, adds horror to its in&s;ide appearance. It is twenty feet high, and twelve thick, built of the &s;ame materials as the hou&s;es; having three gates in each quarter, making twelve in all. Round the
<PB N="143" REF="035035_0135_100019970F3EADF0">
wall are three different ditches or entrenchment about twenty feet deep, and &s;ixteen wide, which were made, like mo&s;t of their public works, by Chri&s;tian &s;laves. The &s;treets inter&s;ect each other at right angles, and on the out&s;ide of each gate are drawbridges over the en|treachments. It is indeed impo&s;&s;ible, at the pre&s;ent day, to &s;ay what the appearance of this place has been, as whole &s;treets are lying in ruins, &s;warming with poi|&s;onous reptiles. The wall however, is nine miles in circumference, and my reader may form &s;ome idea of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the city, when he is informed, that from upwards of 400,000 inhabitants, which it is &s;aid once to have contained, they are now reduced to twenty, or at mo&s;t to twenty-five thou&s;and. The principal &s;treet con&s;i&s;ts almo&s;t entirely of &s;hops; many of them belong to the emperor, who is the chief trafficker in the country, as he receives one tenth of all the goods of his Mahom|etan &s;ubjects, and &s;eizes as much from the others as he plea&s;es. But as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak of the government of the country, and the manners of the in|habitants, afterwards, I &s;hall at pre&s;ent go on with my narrative.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd of February, we were told by Mr. Chapman to hold our&s;elves in readine&s;s in the morning, to march to Mogodore, where he told us we would be much happier, as the &s;ituation was healthier, and the &s;o|ciety we would have, would be mo&s;tly Chri&s;tians. He begged us to live peaceably one with another, and to be
<PB N="144" REF="035035_0136_0FFFF6330D10CD88">
obliging <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the inhabitants of the country. He entreated us not to think of making our e&s;cape, le&s;t we &s;hould fail in the attempt, in which ca&s;e he gave us to under&s;tand, that we &s;hould &s;uffer the mo&s;t cruel death that could be devi&s;ed. He a&s;&s;ured us, that whil&s;t we ob&s;erved his injunctions, we might always look upon him as a friend, and he would take care that we &s;hould not be put to any kind of &s;lavery. After this he gave us a letter, addre&s;|&s;ed to the Venetian con&s;ul at Mogodore, who, he told us, was his own brother, and would befriend us as much as lay in his power. We returned our warme&s;t acknow|ledgments to this worthy gentleman for his kindne&s;s, when he wi&s;hed us a good journey, and left us.</P>
<P>About &s;un-ri&s;ing next morning, we were ready to proceed on our journey, accompanied by an alcaide, fifty hor&s;emen, and twenty camels, loaded with corn, bread, water, tents, and every other nece&s;&s;ary for our journey. We &s;oon &s;et out, and having travelled for four hours, the alcaide, who&s;e name was Saliber, gave orders to &s;top, and refre&s;h the men and hor&s;es. We were &s;erved each, with a &s;mall cake, about the &s;ame &s;ize of that we u&s;ed to receive in the pri&s;on of Larache. We con&s;oled our&s;elves with the hopes of its being re|peated in the cour&s;e of the day, but night came on with|out bringing us any more food. We were again called to &s;top, in the middle of the day, when the meridian &s;un was &s;corching beyond mea&s;ure. We unloaded all our camels, and let them loo&s;e to feed; and a grove
<PB N="145" REF="035035_0137_0FFFF63724850F60">
of figs being in the neighbourhood, we took &s;helter un|der the branches for our&s;elves. Here we found &s;ome oranges growing, with which we refre&s;hed our&s;elves, taking as many along with us, as we conveniently could. After we had re&s;ted about two hours, we were &s;um|moned to proceed on our march, which we continued till, ten o'clock, when we halted by the &s;ide of a &s;mall riv|er, called Niffis, which has its &s;ource in mount Atlas, and runs we&s;tward from this place, nine leagues, when it joins another river; and after many windings, it falls into the Atlantic ocean, thirty leagues north of Mogo|dore. One would expect to find plenty of fi&s;h in &s;uch a river, but the Moors informed us, there was nothing but eels and water-&s;nakes to be found in any river in the country. Whether &s;ome of the great variety of metal|lic &s;ub&s;tances, with which this country abounds, may not prove fatal to the finny tribe, I take not upon me to determine. Certain it is, the rivers in this empire are different from all other running water I ever &s;aw. After rain, they are of a high red colour, and in dry weather thick and muddy.</P>
<P>Next morning, about &s;even o'clock we &s;et forward on our journey, and travelled about three miles on the banks of the river, through a beautiful country which the &s;pring had begun to decorate with all the &s;weets of nature. Before we parted from the river, we &s;topped to refre&s;h our&s;elves, and wandering about the banks of it, we picked up &s;everal o&s;trich feathers, and collected from
<PB N="146" REF="035035_0138_10001998B8CABDF8">
the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> large quantities of &s;ilk. One of our men laid hold of a camelion, the fir&s;t I had ever &s;een. This little animal is about &s;even inches long from the top of the no&s;e to the end of the tail. Its head re&s;embles that of a frog, and it has four legs, very &s;hort, with feet which likewi&s;e re&s;emble a frog's. One remarkable property of this animal, is its changing its colour. It is generally found in a woody country, mo&s;t commonly on a bu&s;h or tree, and its colour is &s;ure to re&s;emble the fruit pro|duced by the tree where you take it. It is &s;aid to live upon air. Certain it is, it is never &s;een to eat any thing, and it is probable the flies and other in&s;ects that inhabit the air, an&s;wer all its purpo&s;es; in the cour&s;e of this journey, we &s;hould have been happy in di&s;covering the art of making them an&s;wer <HI>ours;</HI> for our &s;tated allow|ance was very inadequate to our wants. About &s;ix o'clock this evening we came to a village of about twenty hou&s;es, where we were ordered to pitch our tents. The inha|bitants came flocking around us, every one &s;hewing a degree of curio&s;ity to &s;ee the Chri&s;tians; &s;ome of them gave us &s;mall pieces of bread, and others of tobacco, which by this time were very acceptable pre&s;ents. Next night we encamped at the foot of a little hill, the mo&s;t beautiful eminence I ever beheld; it is half a mile in circumference, and by an ea&s;y a&s;cent of about fifty paces, we got to the top of it. Here we found a beauti|ful plain, &s;urrounded by a grove of vines, and in the middle of it a well, which we were glad to &s;ee, and made towards it to drink. But ju&s;t as we were a|bout
<PB N="147" REF="035035_0139_0FFFF63CC9F197E0">
to quench our thir&s;t, the Moors called us back, telling us, that this was the burial place of &s;everal &s;aints, who had ble&s;&s;ed the water, and none but Mu&s;&s;elmen were allowed to ta&s;te it, and that if either Jew, or Chri&s;tian, pre&s;umed to drink of it, the &s;aints would be enraged, and mu&s;t put the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or to death. We would very gladly have ri&s;ked the anger of the &s;aints, but the vengeance of the Moors, was a more &s;erious bu|&s;ine&s;s, and though our thir&s;t was extreme, we were obli|ged to &s;uffer, with the temptation of excellent water before us. We pulled a few bunches of grapes, and returned to the encampment.</P>
<P>Next day at noon we re&s;ted by the &s;ide of a rivulet, which no &s;aint had meddled with. We took with us a large &s;upply of that nece&s;&s;ary article, as our guides told us, we would not meet with any again for &s;ome time. In the evening we encamped on a very barren plain, where neither water, nor fruits of any kind were to be found. Here, however, were great numbers of ante|lopes, one of which a &s;oldier &s;hot and brought to the camp; but in all this plain we could not find as much wood as would make a fire to roa&s;t it. The &s;oldier therefore cut it up, and putting it in his &s;ack, re&s;erved it for the next night, when we were invited to partake of it, and in all my life, I think, I never eat a better &s;upper. The fle&s;h of this animal is delicate beyond any thing I ever ta&s;ted, and as it was the only animal food, we received during our journey, it was a wel|come

mor&s;el. Next day we had to travel over a long and dreary de&s;ert; we therefore, &s;tarted betimes in the morning, that we might accompli&s;h our journey be|fore night. This de&s;ert extends about thirty miles on the road we had to go, and about fifty miles along the coa&s;t, from north to &s;outh. It is impo&s;&s;ible for the imagination to conceive a more dreary wa&s;te, than that which this day pre&s;ented it&s;elf. We had to travel over mountains of &s;and, on this exten&s;ive de&s;ert, where the rapid whirlwind &s;weeps every thing before it, and where the helple&s;s traveller is frequently buried, never more to ri&s;e. Here the wind often rai&s;es va&s;t quantities of &s;and, and carries it about, till exhau&s;ting it&s;elf, the &s;and falls down; and not unfrequently, a whole cara|van di&s;appears. As the &s;and is perpetually varying its &s;ituation, it is no ea&s;y matter to keep in a direct road, &s;o that one may travel thirty miles without advancing ten, towards the place of their de&s;tination. Our guides, who had often travelled through this de&s;ert before, were frequently at a lo&s;s which way to turn, after holding con&s;ultations among them&s;elves, and often very irre&s;o|lute and undetermined; whil&s;t we, with a burning &s;un over our heads, and almo&s;t fainting with thir&s;t and hunger, became totally indifferent about the pre&s;ervation of lives, which yielded us &s;o little comfort. Frequent|ly we could not for &s;ome minutes open our eyes, and when we did, could not &s;ee &s;ix yards before us. At la&s;t, about four o'clock, one of our guides di&s;covered the i&s;land of Mogodore, which is high land, and di&s;cover|able

at &s;ome di&s;tance. This gave hopes that we &s;hould reach the end of our journey before dark. This hope was our only &s;tay; for we had ta&s;ted nothing to &s;up|port nature, during that whole day, except an orange or two each, which we had luckily pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>About &s;ix o'clock we reached the town, but were o|bliged to &s;top on the out&s;ide of the walls, till the al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ide went to the governor to acquaint him of our arri|val. He did not return for the &s;pace of an hour, by the end of which, the little &s;park of life that remained to us, was almo&s;t extingui&s;hed. Whil&s;t we were ruminating on our wretched condition, we ob&s;erved two gentlemen approach us, in the habit of Chri&s;tians, and on their coming nearer, could hear them talk Engli&s;h. The &s;ight of an European, of whatever country, was a joy|ful di&s;covery; but the mo&s;t delicious mu&s;ic could not equal the &s;ound of the Engli&s;h language. The two gen|tlemen came up to us, and a&s;ked what bad fortune had reduced us to our pre&s;ent condition. We gave them a brief detail of our &s;ituation and &s;ufferings. One of them, Mr. Bain, a native of Ireland, heard us with an emotion, which he could not conceal. "Alas!" &s;ays he, "I have been at the &s;chool of adver&s;ity my&s;elf, and mo&s;t &s;incerely do I &s;ympathize with you in your mis|fortunes. At pre&s;ent my circum&s;tances are ea&s;y, and happy &s;hall I e&s;teem my&s;elf, if I can by any means light|en the burden you are doomed to bear. Follow me, my Chri&s;tian friends, my hou&s;e and heart &s;hall be open

to you; your misfortunes are the be&s;t letter of recom|mendation you can bring, and if I cannot procure your liberty, I will at lea&s;t endeavour to make your bondage le&s;s irk&s;ome." We were endeavouring to find words to expre&s;s our gratitude, when the other gentleman, who&s;e name was Hutchi&s;on, prevented us. "Mr. Bain," &s;ays he, "the goodne&s;s of your heart, hurries you in this in&s;tance beyond the bounds of prudence. The&s;e unfor|tunate men, mu&s;t not upon any account, leave this place, till the alcaide returns, otherwi&s;e he will be enraged, and perhaps cau&s;e the governor to puni&s;h them &s;everely. Let them remain where they are at all events; only take one of the &s;oldiers with you, and &s;end &s;ome relief to their pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ities, which I plainly perceive are very pre&s;&s;ing; and when the governor has a&s;&s;igned them their re&s;idence, we &s;hall &s;oon know where it is, and be able to give them what &s;upport they &s;tand in need of." Mr. Bain thanked him for his caution, and a&s;&s;enting to his propo&s;al, immediately went to &s;end us the relief we &s;tood &s;o much in need of; and happy it was for us that he went; for I believe there was not one among us had as much remaining &s;trength, as w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d have carried him a mile from the &s;pot. A Jew, who was the me&s;&s;enger, &s;oon returned, bringing a large piece of beef, with bread &s;ufficient for a whole day, and a bottle of excel|lent brandy. I am certain I owe it to this worthy per&s;on that I am at this moment alive, and able to write his name; and never &s;hall I write or mention it without the tear of gratitude, while memory holds her

&s;eat. The alcaide gave him&s;elf no trouble about us, as a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the lea&s;t &s;park of humanity, would have done, after the dreadful day we had pa&s;&s;ed; he went away, and returned without offering us a mor&s;el of food, and &s;tood very deliberately with the governor &s;urveying us, and telling him our hi&s;tory, for at lea&s;t, another hour after he returned, before we were order|ed to march to the place a&s;&s;igned us. After we had &s;taid long enough to gratify public curio&s;ity, we were at la&s;t taken to a hou&s;e, which the governor informed us was to be our re&s;idence, where they left us, and in a &s;hort time we were again vi&s;ited by our two benevolent friends. Mr. Hutchi&s;on informed us, he had been with the gov|ernor, and made enquiry what was to be done with us; and that he had informed him, he had no particular or|ders concerning us, further, than that we were to re|main under his care, till the emperor &s;hould further &s;ig|nify his plea&s;ure. "And now," &s;ays he, "my dear fellows, con&s;ider you are in the mid&s;t of enemies, who will take every opportunity of working your ruin. On your behaviour much depends. There are many Chri&s;|tians in this town, but the mo&s;t independent among us, are obliged to walk with the utmo&s;t circum&s;pection. The very name <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> &s;ounds odious in the ears of a Moor. Be &s;trict ob&s;ervers of the laws of morality, pre|&s;erve unanimity among your&s;elves, and tru&s;t to that good Being, who will &s;ooner or later reward the virtu|ous, for a happy i&s;&s;ue to your&s;elves." He then de&s;ired to know, if any of us belonged to Britain: I told him, I
<PB N="152" REF="035035_0144_0FFFF64AF91E7790">
did, and pointed out another young man, a native of England, and a third who came from Ireland. He then pulled out of his pocket, three dollars and gave it to us to purcha&s;e, as he &s;aid, pipes and tobacco. You will have many dull hours, &s;aid he, to pa&s;s by your&s;elves, but all of you I hope can read, and &s;ome of you no doubt can write. I have a large collection of books of all kinds, and &s;hall be happy in &s;eeing you pa&s;s your time in reading, rather than enter into the company of your enemies, who, from your ignorance of the lan|guage, and cu&s;toms of the country, will have many ad|vantages over you, of which they will avail them&s;elves. Employ your lei&s;ure hours in books, you will find them innocent companions; &s;uch of you as can write, &s;hall be furni&s;hed with nece&s;&s;aries for, that purpo&s;e. The&s;e a|mu&s;ements will both help to make your time pa&s;s agree|ably, and be a &s;ource of improvement for your under|&s;tandings, a trea&s;ure no accident can deprive you of in all time coming. If any of you wants any thing el&s;e, be not backward in letting your wi&s;hes be known. Mr. Bain and I have it in our power, to add con&s;iderably to your happine&s;s, without injury to our&s;elves; and while you continue to befriend your&s;elves, you &s;hall never want our be&s;t offices.</P>
<P>We attempted to thank the&s;e worthy gentlemen, but for my own part language was too imperfect to expre&s;s my feelings. I had, all my life, accu&s;tomed my&s;elf to reading, when my time would permit, but this was a

plea&s;ure I had been totally deprived of &s;ince I came into this country. I therefore told Mr. Hutchi&s;on, I would accept his kind offer with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure. He went away, promi&s;ing to &s;end us a little library next day, with writing uten&s;ils. He punctually ob&s;erved his promi&s;e, and now I thought my &s;ituation more com|fortable than it ever had been &s;ince I &s;et my foot on this inho&s;pitable &s;hore. I had from my fir&s;t going to &s;ea, kept a journal of the little tran&s;actions I had wit|ne&s;&s;ed, and gone through; and as I was now con&s;idera|bly behind, I thought this was the mo&s;t proper time to make up my leeway, as our &s;ea phra&s;e is. I continued my journal, therefore, from the day we were taken by the cor&s;air; which, without any material alterations, is the &s;ame I now offer to the public. Next morning Mr. Hutchi&s;on called to &s;ee how we were employed, and taking a look at my work, he encouraged me to go on with it, promi&s;ing me any information I &s;hould wi&s;h for, as my pre&s;ent circum&s;tances put it out of my power, to go abroad into the country for that purpo&s;e; and to him I am indebted for &s;everal circum&s;tances I could not o|therwi&s;e have known. In this manner I continued to amu&s;e my&s;elf for about the &s;pace of a month, at the end of which, we were joined by ten French &s;ailors, who were in as bad a plight as our&s;elves, and had met with a &s;till harder fate.</P>
<P>In the year 1783, they had &s;ailed from Bordeaux for the coa&s;t of Guinea, but as they drew near it, there

aro&s;e a heavy gale of wind from the we&s;tward, which forced them upon this dreadful &s;hore. The captain no &s;ooner found his &s;hip aground, and like to be lo&s;t, than he flew to his cabin, gra&s;ped a pi&s;tol, and lodged the fatal contents in his own brain. This ra&s;h act, which no di&s;tre&s;s could ju&s;tify, totally robbed the crew of their remaining &s;pirits, and reduced them to a &s;tate of &s;tupefaction. But the &s;hip was going to pieces, and time was precious. They hoi&s;ted out the long boat, and made towards the &s;hore, which by that time was crowded with the inhabitants of the country, and though they expected little mercy, they were willing to protract the &s;pan of exi&s;tence to as great length as po&s;&s;ible. In the mo&s;t be&s;eeching po&s;ture, therefore, they made their approaches to them; but they had not long reached the &s;hore, when a quarrel aro&s;e among them, the cau&s;e of which they could not di&s;cover: af|ter a bloody battle, the victorious party &s;eized and bound them, and in that &s;ituation left them, and went down to the beach.</P>
<P>By this time the &s;hip was gone to pieces, and the wreck coming a&s;hore. Among other things a puncheon of rum was ca&s;t out, which they &s;eized upon, and began to drink, till they were all in a &s;tate of complete intox|ication: they then continued to rage about for &s;ome time, after which they all fell fa&s;t a&s;leep. The unfor|tunate Frenchmen, who had anxiou&s;ly watched their motions, no &s;ooner ob&s;erved this, than they di&s;engaged
<PB N="155" REF="035035_0147_0FFFF656B7EA7FB8">
them&s;elves from their &s;hackles, and fled to the moun|tains. By day they hid them&s;elves, and by night they journeyed through the mo&s;t de&s;olate uninhabited parts of the country, depending upon nature's &s;pontaneous produce, for the &s;canty nouri&s;hment they received. Thus they exi&s;ted for three weeks, when one day as they were &s;eeking for food, they were &s;urprized by a party of the mountaineers, who, as I already ob&s;erved, are headed by the emperor's &s;on. They kept them in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for &s;ome days, and then carried them to the prince, who was glad of &s;uch a prize, knowing that his father would purcha&s;e them at almo&s;t any price: ac|cordingly he &s;ent to inform the emperor, and to offer to &s;ell them to him at the rate of two hundred dollars per man. The bargain was &s;truck, and the men &s;ent down, by the emperor's orders, to Mogodore. Nei|ther their &s;ituation nor ours was enviable at the time when we met, and yet. I &s;uppo&s;e, it gave each party plea&s;ure to meet with the other. There is a plea&s;ure in &s;ociety, even in the mo&s;t wretch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d condition. Nei|ther party were acquainted with the language of the other, but to make up for this, the greater part of us un|der&s;tood Spani&s;h, and in this language we recapitulated our misfortunes, and felt a mutual plea&s;ure in the &s;ym|pathy they excited. It unfortunately happened, how|ever, that they had neither &s;o much liberty, nor &s;o many friends as we had; and as the emperor had pur|cha&s;ed them at &s;o high a rate, they de&s;paired of ever
<PB N="156" REF="035035_0148_0FFFF65BD4C16E48">
obtaining their liberty, and expected nothing el&s;e but to end their days in a &s;tate of wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>Six weeks after their arrival, we had an addition to our &s;ociety of ten men more. The&s;e were the crew of a ve&s;&s;el, which had been out fi&s;hing; they belonged to the we&s;tern i&s;les, and had been put on &s;hore by the heavy gales, upon this coa&s;t; and being taken up by the inhabitants, were likewi&s;e made pri&s;oners by the impe|rial order. The Spani&s;h language was now become pretty familiar to us, and the&s;e la&s;t perfected us &s;o much, that in a &s;hort time we could conver&s;e with fluency and ca&s;e: and though we were of different countries and religions, both national and religious differences were lo&s;t, in the con&s;ideration that we were all Europe|ans and Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>For &s;everal weeks we &s;pent our time in the utmo&s;t harmony, till one day our captain was invited to dine with Mr. Hutchi&s;on, and returning home in the even|ing, heated perhaps with liquor, he began to abu&s;e a young man, who was a great favourite with us all, to a degree that was in&s;ufferable. He had conceived a di&s;like to this young man, which had manife&s;ted it&s;elf in many in&s;tances during our voyage; and now, though they were on a footing, he began to &s;peak to him in a man|ner, which the high mettled youth could not bear. He told him he was not now &s;ubject to his authority, that he was as much a &s;lave as any of his men, and he
<PB N="157" REF="035035_0149_0FFFF662134A56D8">
&s;hould certainly cure him of his impertinence if he heard any more of it. The re&s;t of the hands all e&s;|pou&s;ed the young man's cau&s;e, which the captain per|ceiving &s;wore he would revenge him&s;elf on us all, by having us put in chains next day; which, he &s;aid, he could ea&s;ily get done by &s;peaking to Mr. Hutchi&s;on. He did not forget his threat in the morning, but went to Mr. Hutchi&s;on to complain. This worthy gentleman was much hurt at hearing there was any di&s;&s;ention a|mong us and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the captain with a &s;harp repri|mand; de&s;iring him, in his pre&s;ent &s;tate, to con&s;ider him&s;elf on a footing of equality with his men, and not a&s;&s;ume a power over them, till he got them again on his own element. He was a&s;hamed, he &s;aid, to hear of Chri&s;tians in our &s;ituation quarrelling among them&s;elves, and if the governor heard of it, we &s;hould all be put under the yoke immediately. The captain returned ve|ry much di&s;&s;atisfied and out of humour; which the hands perceiving, and partly gue&s;&s;ing the cau&s;e, gave him a very hearty drubbing. The French and Spani&s;h &s;ailors, who were pre&s;ent, gave an unanimous deci&s;ion again&s;t him, and the captain led but a very unea&s;y life ever after, as the Chri&s;tian merchants, who had paid him &s;ome attention before, totally de&s;erted him, and of all that were in the pri&s;on, &s;carce one would &s;peak to him. One very bad con&s;equence of this di&s;pute, how|ever, was a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of Mr. Hutchi&s;on's friend&s;hip, who, together with the worthy Hibernian already men|tioned, had &s;upplied us liberally with food, and many
<PB N="158" REF="035035_0150_100019ADA07D4A90">
other nece&s;&s;aries. They did not for many days come near us, and we were obliged to fall upon many &s;chemes to get our&s;elves &s;upported. I lo&s;t my &s;upply of paper, and was obliged to give up the bu&s;ine&s;s of writing.</P>
<P>Nece&s;&s;ity is the mother or intention&mdash;I went to a cooper, and getting &s;mall pieces of wood fit for my purpo&s;e, &s;et about making little &s;hips, and got them rigged with &s;ome old rags of linen. I &s;oon became a proficient at the bu&s;ine&s;s, in&s;omuch, that I got a de|cent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by &s;elling them. I have &s;old my ve&s;&s;els, &s;ometimes, at &s;ix and &s;even dollars each, and even a very indifferent one brought me four or five. Thus I got my&s;elf plentifully &s;upplied with paper and many other things I &s;tood need of, and was &s;ometimes enabled to a&s;&s;i&s;t a neighbour. This too afforded me a little variety, for when I was tired of the carpenter bu&s;ine&s;s; I took to writing, and when I grew weary of &s;tudy I again be|came a mechanic.</P>
<P>For &s;everal weeks I carried on this traffic, during which time, neither of our good friends had ever cal|led to &s;ee us; at la&s;t Mr. Hutchi&s;on &s;urpri&s;ed us with a vi&s;it. He found me writing, and began to enquire how I had found materials. I told him of my carpenter &s;cheme with which he was highly plea&s;ed. He promi&s;ed, that for the future, I &s;hould be under no nece&s;&s;ity to rack my invention, for a &s;mall &s;upply of money. He then gave me three dollars as an earne&s;t of future fa|vours,
<PB N="159" REF="035035_0151_0FFFF6639BDA0CF8">
and giving us many good advices, and putting a dollar into the hand of each of the re&s;t, he bade us adieu.</P>
<P>We were one day availing our&s;elves of the liberty granted us of walking in the Jew's-town when we di&s;|covered a large ve&s;&s;el, making towards the harbour. The hopes of her being an American, for a few minutes rai&s;ed our &s;pirits; but we &s;oon came to learn, that &s;he brought the Dutch amba&s;&s;ador and his &s;uit. Upon his landing, he went to a hou&s;e prepared for his reception, and as this was the fir&s;t European ve&s;&s;el which had arri|ved during our &s;tay in the place, we ca&s;t many a wi&s;h|ful look towards the harbour, and &s;ighed bitterly for that liberty, which we began to fear we &s;hould never regain. One of our number &s;ugge&s;ted that the Dutch amba&s;&s;ador might ea&s;ily obtain our liberty, if he could be prevailed with to a&s;k it. It was agreed, at all hands, that an application to the amba&s;&s;ador could do no harm; and as he was to &s;et out next morning for Morocco, we thought no time was to be lo&s;t. We went to his lodg|ings, and were readily admitted to his pre&s;ence; he heard our &s;tory with a Dutch indifference, and when we had told it, he promi&s;ed, courtier-like, to do every thing in his power for us: and courtier-like, I &s;uppo&s;e, thought no more about us, for we never heard another word of the bu&s;ine&s;s. Soon after this, the Portugue&s;e amba&s;&s;a|dor arrived, and to him, we made a &s;imilar application, with the like &s;ucce&s;s. Still, however, we were in ex|pectation
<PB N="160" REF="035035_0152_0FFFF668CC31A888">
of the arrival of amba&s;&s;adors from Britain and America; from either of which we made our&s;elves cer|tain of obtaining every thing we wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>About this time orders were &s;ent to Mogodore, to prepare for the reception of the emperor, who meant to pay a vi&s;it to this part of his dominions, which he had never &s;een before. The town for &s;everal days, was all bu&s;tle and uproar, preparing for his reception. At la&s;t the important day arrived that was to give the inhabi|tants a &s;ight of their &s;overeign. The road for many miles was lined with &s;pectators. Among others, a large body of Jews went out to meet him, but to their great mortification, he &s;ent orders for them to di&s;per&s;e imme|diately, before they approached him. The hills on every &s;ide were covered with the impatient multitude, who, with loud and repeated huzzas, hailed his approach. About noon he made his appearance attended by an ar|my of fifteen thou&s;and men, nine thou&s;and of which were infantry, and the re&s;t cavalry. This guard, great as it may appear, was but a &s;mall part of his forces, for he generally keeps a &s;tanding army of one hundred thou&s;and men, the mo&s;t of them blacks, or &s;laves. The &s;tate kept up by an ea&s;tern monarch appears incredible to &s;uch as never have &s;een it. It is cu&s;tomary for the emperor, when he vi&s;its any town in his own dominions, to do &s;ome generous act or other, &s;uch as giving &s;ome magnificent pre&s;ent, granting liberty to &s;laves, or advancing &s;ome of his &s;ubjects to &s;ome dignity or pre|ferment.
<PB N="161" REF="035035_0153_100019B04A7571C8">
The wretched lay hold of &s;hadows&mdash;for &s;eve|ral days we indulged a hope that we could be of the number of them who would receive the royal clemen|cy; but alas! no &s;uch good fortune awaited us. The emperor entered the city in the middle of a long pro|ce&s;&s;ion, riding in a chariot, drawn by four beautiful Ara|bian hor&s;es. After him in other chariots followed five of his wives. And when all his guards had entered the gates, the nobility, who had a&s;&s;embled from many parts of the empire, with a long li&s;t of ba&s;haws, governors, &amp;c. brought up the rear. About four hundred camels, loaded with provi&s;ions, corn, tents, &amp;c. were left on the out&s;ide of the gates. The emperor went &s;traight to a now fortification, where apartments were provided for him.</P>
<P>After witne&s;&s;ing this grand di&s;play of imperial dig|nity, we retired to our apartment. Scarcely could we clo&s;e our eyes during the whole night for alternate hopes and fears about our freedom, but in the morning, hope began to preponderate, when a me&s;&s;age was received for all the Chri&s;tian &s;laves in Mogodore to hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s to appear in the royal pre&s;ence. Then we almo&s;t made our&s;elves certain that the happy hour was come. He received us in a garden &s;itting cro&s;s-legged in the Mahometan manner, on a rich carpet &s;pread upon the ground, with many of his nobles about him, and part of his guard ranged behind him at &s;ome di&s;tance. We were marched, up within a few yards of him, and
<PB N="162" REF="035035_0154_0FFFF66F6AD0F7D0">
&s;tood in the form of a &s;emi-circle. He fir&s;t addre&s;&s;ed the Spaniards&mdash;"An amba&s;&s;ador from your country is &s;oon expected here, when you will be at liberty to go off with him. You, Frenchman, mu&s;t remain till your king thinks proper to &s;end his u&s;ual tribute to me, which has been &s;everal years neglected. As for you, Engli&s;h|men, (for &s;o he always called us) I have &s;uffered you to live at your ca&s;e, and you appear to be healthy and well fed. I have already told you, and I again repeat my promi&s;e, that you &s;hall not be put to any kind of &s;lave|ry; but I mu&s;t, and will detain you, till that country of yours &s;hall &s;end an amba&s;&s;ador to treat with me, and &s;e|cure my friend&s;hip and protection for your trade." He &s;at for &s;ometime &s;urveying us, and afterwards ri&s;ing and walking towards his guard, we were remanded to the hou&s;e of our captivity, which we again entered with heavy hearts.</P>
<P>During the emperor's &s;tay at Mogodore, he inflicted a mo&s;t cruel puni&s;hment upon one of his ba&s;haws. He was commander of the ba&s;haw's band, and perhaps one of the be&s;t officers the emperor had. On their way from Morocco hither he had, by &s;ome irregular &s;tep, incurred the emperor's di&s;plea&s;ure; for which he was re&s;olved to puni&s;h him. Yet the emperor found it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to act with caution, and did not attempt this till &s;ome time after his arrival here. Having ordered him to be &s;eized and brought before him, he &s;entenced him to have his beard pulled out by the roots. He was ac|cordingly
<PB N="163" REF="035035_0155_100019B1F4DF9178">
taken from the royal pre&s;ence into a large &s;quare, which was lined with ba&s;haws, and there openly expo&s;ed to the cruel operation; after which he was for ever di&s;charged from the pre&s;ence of his royal ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the emperor remained at Mogodore, two large &s;hips entered the harbour with Engli&s;h colours flying. One of our men who had been out walking, ob&s;erving them, came running in with the news, when we all walked to the harbour, and learnt, to our great &s;atis|faction, that the Engli&s;h con&s;ul, or amba&s;&s;ador was in one of them. This we looked upon as a joyful event, as we made our&s;elves believe our liberty now was cer|tain. The guards were drawn up in order to receive this repre&s;entative of his Britannic maje&s;ty, the &s;hip &s;alu|ted, and the forts returned the compliment, and a great number of the nobility attended to welcome him a&s;hore, and conduct him to his lodgings. We did not for &s;ome days think proper to trouble him, till he had time to get a fir&s;t audience of the emperor, and deliver his pre|&s;ents; which were twelve bra&s;s cannons, with a large quantity of powder and &s;hot, two eight inch mortars, an elegant time piece, and a mu&s;ical in&s;trument. The emperor liked no mu&s;ic &s;o well as the &s;ound of a cannon, con&s;equently the mu&s;ical in&s;trument was given to his wives; and the people ob&s;erved that the Engli&s;h con|&s;ul mu&s;t be a man of con&s;ummate addre&s;s, who could find out the &s;ecret of plea&s;ing, at once, both the em|peror and his wives. After the fir&s;t audience was over,
<PB N="164" REF="035035_0156_0FFFF6782AB61CD0">
we made it our bu&s;ine&s;s to pay our re&s;pects to this great man; and our two worthy friends Me&s;&s;rs. Bain and Hutchi&s;on, did us the honour to accompany us. We gained admittance, after he had kept us long enough at the door to convince us of his dignity; when in the mo&s;t moving terms our imagination could &s;ugge&s;t, we preferred our petition. With all the hems, and haws, which great men make u&s;e of on little occa&s;ions, he heard our &s;tory. "You &s;ailed in an American bottom, you &s;ay? Why do you not apply to the great Mr. Wa&s;hington? he is the mo&s;t proper per&s;on to procure your liberty." One of the Americans an&s;wered him, that Mr. Wa&s;hington had already convinced the world, that he had too great a regard for liberty to have any human being in &s;lavery, if he had the &s;ame opportunity that he now had of &s;etting him free. "Well," &s;ays he, "you had better apply to him. Had your country re|mained under the Briti&s;h government, you might then have had &s;ome claim upon my friend&s;hip, but as mat|ters now &s;tand, if one word from me would procure you liberty, you &s;hould not have it." I then told him, that other two young men and my&s;elf were natives of the Briti&s;h dominions, and were willing to enter on board of a man of war, if he would procure liberty for us; but without deigning to an&s;wer us, he turned round, and with a &s;tately air-walked into another apartment.</P>
<P>Half frantic with grief, rage, and di&s;appointment, we returned to our own hou&s;e. Our high-built hopes were
<PB N="165" REF="035035_0157_0FFFF67D495484F0">
now levelled with the du&s;t, and nothing but perpetual bondage could we perceive between us and the grave. In a few days afterwards, the Engli&s;h con&s;ul left Mogo|dore, and &s;ailed for Gibraltar; and on the &s;ame day the emperor took his departure for Morocco. We had been confined to our pri&s;on ever &s;ince the arrival of the em|peror, but were now indulged with the liberty of walk|ing as u&s;ual; and going one day to the Quay, to &s;ee a boat land, a man in a Chri&s;tian habit came a&s;hore, and &s;urveying us with attention, a&s;ked how we happened to come to this country. We were happy to hear him ad|dre&s;s us in Engli&s;h, and told him our &s;tory. "I am heartily &s;orry," &s;ays he, "to find you in a country, where, in all probability, you will be confined for life. I think there is a po&s;&s;ibility of your e&s;caping, and if you do not get off in that manner, you may lie here till you rot. I think it is in my power to effect your e&s;cape, if you have &s;pirit to follow my advice." We he&s;itated in returning an an&s;wer, not being certain, on &s;o &s;hort an acquaintance, whether or not we might tru&s;t him. "Blood!" &s;ays he, "what are you afraid of? am not I your friend and countryman, a native of Ireland? and before I'd betray you, I would lo&s;e my heart's blood. I am pilot of a Portugue&s;e &s;chooner which lies off this harbour, take a walk and &s;hew me where you live, and my life for it, I'll do your bu&s;ine&s;s in the cour&s;e of a few weeks." We &s;hewed him our hou&s;e, when he ha&s;tily took leave of us; telling us he would &s;ee us a|gain. We knew not what judgment to form of this man.
<PB N="166" REF="035035_0159_0FFFF682614CCF90">
His &s;cheme he had not told us, con&s;equently we could be no judges of its practicability; we therefore determin|ed, at all rates to &s;ay but little about the matter, till time &s;hould enable us to judge of his hone&s;ty, and the po&s;&s;ibility of making good his promi&s;e.</P>
<P>Next morning he paid as a vi&s;it, and placing him&s;elf on a &s;eat without ceremony, he pulled a bottle of bran|dy out of his pocket. "Come my boys," &s;ays he, "this will make us under&s;tand one another better than a whole days conver&s;ation. Here is liberty to all who dare con|tend for it." And putting the bottle to his mouth, took a hearty &s;wigg; after which he handed it round, and invited us all to follow his example. In the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation, he told us, his name was Griffiths, that he had been &s;everal years in Portugal, but was heartily &s;ick of the country, and would take an early opportunity of either returning to his own country, or of going to A|merica. In the mean time he was &s;ure he had hit upon a &s;cheme for obtaining our liberty, which could not fail of &s;ucce&s;s; and if we had but &s;pirit to undertake it, he would defy either the emperor of Morocco, or the grand Turk him&s;elf to thwart it. He de&s;ired us, how|ever, to be cautious of &s;aying a word about it, till we heard farther from him. We told him there would be no danger of that, as he had not yet imparted it to our|&s;elves. He told us, he did not mean to impart it to us till nearer the time of its execution, and pulling another bottle of brandy out of his pocket, drank &s;ucce&s;s to
<PB N="167" REF="035035_0160_100019B751096B70">
all good intentions. When he had fini&s;hed this, he took his leave of us, bidding us keep up our &s;pirits and tru&s;t to an Iri&s;hman for once.&mdash;There was a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and hone&s;ty vi&s;ible in the countenance and behaviour of this worthy Hibernian, which entirely bani&s;hed all &s;u&s;|picion of his having any de&s;igns to betray us, and made us re&s;olve to tru&s;t our&s;elves entirely to his management and directions.</P>
<P>Next day &s;ix of us agreed to take a walk into the country, we wi&s;hed to have &s;ome Moors of our acquain|tance along with us, but not finding any willing to go, we &s;et out by our&s;elves. We extended our walk to the di&s;tance of four or five miles from the town, on the road leading to Saffic, and going carele&s;sly on, were &s;uddenly alarmed with the appearance of a caravan of mountain|eers, to the number of twelve, who had been at the town di&s;po&s;ing of their oil and corn. We immediately made off, to avoid them, and getting into a little plain between two ri&s;ing hills, re&s;olved to wait till they &s;hould pa&s;s us: but all of a &s;udden we were alarmed with a di&s;mal &s;cream, which was &s;ucceeded by a &s;hower of &s;tones, and immediately perceived them all running in upon us. We were certain, if they could lay hold of us, they would carry us into the country; and though it was on|ly exchanging one &s;pecies of bondage for another, we were afraid that their treatment of us might not be &s;o mild as that we had hitherto experienced; and what was wor&s;e, our chance of getting out of the country
<PB N="168" REF="035035_0161_0FFFF68A18F93810">
was lo&s;t for ever. We re&s;olved, therefore, to defend our&s;elves to the la&s;t, and taking up &s;tones, began a bat|tle which la&s;ted for an hour. On our part we main|tained a kind of running &s;ight, till we had got between them and the town, and finding we had gained the point, we attacked them vigourou&s;ly, and, though they were twice our number, they were obliged to make a preci|pitate retreat, and leaving their camels behind them, which we immediately drove off, intending to take them along with us to the town. We drove the camels on without interruption till we were within a &s;hort di&s;tance of the town, when we e&s;pied at a di&s;tance, another body of the &s;ame kind meeting us, and not caring to be at|tacked in both front and rear at once, we quitted our booty, and made off the road till they pa&s;&s;ed us, when we made the be&s;t of our way to the town. It was (as Mr. Hutchi&s;on afterwards informed us,) a fortunate circum&s;tance that we came off &s;o well, for had we been taken, we would in all probability have been carried to Algiers, and &s;old to hopele&s;s and perpetual &s;lavery.</P>
<P>A few days afterwards, we took a walk on the other &s;ide of the town, towards the burying ground. In this excur&s;ion we were met by crowds of women, who had been vi&s;iting the &s;ilent habitations of their decea&s;ed re|lations. Five of them coming up to us, made a &s;tand right before us, and taking off their veils, &s;hewed us much hand&s;omer faces than we expected to find in that country. They made &s;igns for us to &s;top, and though
<PB N="169" REF="035035_0162_0FFFF68E3074CCE8">
they were unable to conver&s;e with us by words, they made u&s;e of a language univer&s;ally under&s;tood&mdash;the lan|guage of the eyes&mdash;and mo&s;t eloquent and per&s;ua&s;ive their rhetoric was. We had &s;carcely &s;een a Moori&s;h woman's face, &s;ince we entered the country, and were &s;trongly tempted to take up the gauntlet. But we dreaded the con&s;equences, and fled from the&s;e bewitch|ing Syrens with the utmo&s;t precepitation. We pur&s;ued our rout till we came to the burying ground, where great numbers were &s;cattered up and down, bewailing and lamenting in the mo&s;t pitiable manner over their de|cea&s;ed friends. On our way home, we had &s;everal re|counters &s;imilar to that already mentioned, the women always beginning the attack by taking of their veils and &s;hewing their faces; but as we &s;u&s;pected they only meant to lead us into trouble, we with&s;tood every temp|tation.&mdash;The Moori&s;h women, &s;o far as we could judge, would be beautiful, had they only the delicate com|plexions of our fair country women, to &s;et off the mo&s;t regular features in the world. But,
<Q><L>The &s;un that rolls its chariot o'er their heads,</L>
<L>Brings too much fire and colour to their cheeks.</L></Q>
They are generally tall, &s;traight, and well formed, with a luxuriant crop of black hair, hanging down, almo&s;t to their heels.</P>
<P>Returning to our habitation, we found our good friend Mr. Griffith's had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it before us.
<PB N="170" REF="035035_0163_0FFFF692DCAED1B8">
He had as u&s;ual, brought an antidote again&s;t care; hav|ing lined his pockets with two bottles of brandy, which, he told us, he had purcha&s;ed of a Jew, who made it him&s;elf; for, though the laws of Mahomet &s;trictly pro|hibit the u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors and wines of all &s;orts, the Jews in this country make large quantities of both, and &s;ell them at a very cheap rate. The brandy is com|monly &s;old for two ounces, or one Engli&s;h &s;hilling the quart, and wine proportionably lower. Mr. Hutchi&s;on had enabled us to a&s;k our new friend to dine with us; and after we had fini&s;hed our repa&s;t, we were joined by two Engli&s;h, who, each of them brought a bottle in his pocket, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of which, we were enabled to forget our cares, and to &s;pend the afternoon together with the greate&s;t hilarity.</P>
<P>Next morning Mr. Hutchi&s;on paid us a vi&s;it, and informed us, that a con&s;ul or amba&s;&s;ador from Sweden, was ju&s;t come into the harbour, and would come a&s;hore immediately. We all repaired to the harbour to &s;ee his landing. In about an hour's time he came a&s;hore, at|tended by thirty other gentlemen, &s;ome of whom meant to make a tour through Barbary; and others to return with the con&s;ul to their own country. He was received with all the compliments u&s;ually paid upon the like occa&s;ions, and conducted to his lodgings by a num|ber of ba&s;haws, alcaides, &amp;c. attended with a &s;trong guard of cavalry. His coming was a joyful &s;ight to one of our mates, who being a native of Sweden, began
<PB N="171" REF="035035_0164_100019B8D29A8708">
to entertain the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes of obtaining his liberty. Next morning he took the opportunity of calling at his hou&s;e, and telling him his &s;tory. The amba&s;&s;ador told him to make him&s;elf ea&s;y, as he would certainly apply for his liberty, and had little doubt of obtaining it. He &s;et out the next morning for Morocco, and in a &s;hort time a guard arrived, to con|duct our companion thither, with intelligence, that the amba&s;&s;ador had applied and been &s;ucce&s;sful. We parted from him with heavy hearts; but &s;orrow was unavailing, and we were obliged to &s;ubmit to our fate. We had no other hopes but from Mr. Griffith's &s;cheme, and what that &s;cheme was, we were &s;till ignorant, but we all determined to a&s;k him &s;eriou&s;ly the fir&s;t time he came to vi&s;it us. He did not let us wait long for an opportunity, as he vi&s;ited us daily. We told him we were very impatient to know by what means he intend|ed to effect our e&s;cape. "Well," &s;ays he, "I mean to gratify you,&mdash;my &s;cheme is this: The &s;chooner to which I belong lies in the bay. Some of you, I doubt not, are expert at &s;wimming: I will give you notice when we mean to &s;ail, and the night before our depar|ture you mu&s;t all come down to the &s;hore about twelve o'clock. Let the be&s;t &s;wimmer come and take of the long boat, which &s;hall be riding a&s;tern for that purpo&s;e, and go a&s;hore for the re&s;t, and when you get to the &s;chooner, confine us all below and run off with the ve&s;|&s;el. I &s;hall take care to manage the captain, &s;o that no bad con&s;equences &s;hall en&s;ue, and we can run the
<PB N="172" REF="035035_0165_0FFFF696F0EED330">
&s;hip into Gibraltar or Cadiz, as circum&s;tances will per|mit." And now you have heard my &s;cheme, how do you like it? We told him it would do admirably, and agreed to walk by his directions in every re&s;pect. The &s;chooner, however, he told us was not to &s;ail for a month; and I re&s;olved to fill up the interim with viewing every thing worthy of notice about this town, and collect what information I could re&s;pecting the cu&s;toms and manners of the country. In one of my rambles I hap|pened to pa&s;s one of the churches or mo&s;ques, and as I had never &s;een the form of wor&s;hip, I felt my&s;elf &s;trong|ly impelled to enter, and going up to the door, I learned my&s;elf again&s;t it, to deliberate whether or not I &s;hould go in, immediately the door opened, and expo&s;ed me to the view of a congregation, many of whom began to make &s;ignals for me to enter. Whil&s;t I was he&s;itating what to do, a Jew with whom I had &s;ome previous ac|quaintance, came &s;uddenly behind me, and pulling me back with all his might, laid me &s;prawling on the ground. His mode of attack enraged me to that degree, that I got up with a full intention to cha&s;ti&s;e him, but he &s;oon pacified me, by letting me know, that if I had entered the mo&s;que, I mu&s;t either have turned Mu&s;&s;ulman, or I would in all probability, never have got out alive. In|&s;tead of the cha&s;ti&s;ement I intended him, I took him by the hand, thanked him kindly for his interference, and inviting him home with me, I repaid his civility with a bumper or two of brandy. Two Engli&s;h coopers, who were with my companions, hearing the &s;tory, were &s;ur|pri&s;ed

they had not followed us, and for &s;ome hours I could &s;carcely per&s;uade my&s;elf that I was &s;afe in our own hou&s;e.</P>
<P>About this time a circum&s;tance took place &s;imiliar to that of the young Jewe&s;s before related, but of a more fatal nature. The Moors from their ignorance and in|attention to all kinds of bu&s;ine&s;s, pa&s;s away their time in &s;loth and indolence, indulging them&s;elves in almo&s;t every gratification. They are particularly fond of &s;leep|ing in the open fields, or among the rocks on the &s;ea|&s;hore. One day a number of them were enjoying them|&s;elves in this manner, about a quarter of a mile from the town. Now it is u&s;ual for them on almo&s;t all occa|&s;ions, to throw off their &s;lippers, or <HI>pampoo&s;es</HI>; and one of them awaking, ha&s;tily thru&s;t his feet into his &s;lippers&punc; un&s;u&s;picious of danger; when he received the fatal &s;ting of a &s;corpion between two of his toes. Whether the &s;ting of this had been more venomous than that of the young Jewe&s;s, or whether the Moor was ignorant of the mode of preventing the poi&s;on from operating, I cannot determine; but it proved almo&s;t in&s;tant death. His &s;creams awakened his companions, who immediately came to his relief, but could afford him none; and in about three minutes he expired, &s;wollen to a &s;hocking degree.</P>
<P>We u&s;ed frequently to go to the &s;ea &s;ide, in a body to wa&s;h our &s;hirts, and after we had performed this ope|ration,
<PB N="174" REF="035035_0167_100019BDED0417F8">
and laid them out to dry, we went into the wa|ter, and amu&s;ed our&s;elves &s;wimming till we could put them on; and as the &s;un is very powerful in that coun|try, they were &s;oon as dry as we could wi&s;h. One day after we had been thus employed we were returning home, when we e&s;pied a great crowd of people not far from us, and going to &s;ee what was the matter, we ob|&s;erved an idiot &s;tanding in the middle of the crowd, holding a large &s;nake in his hand. His looks and ge&s;|tures bore evident marks of the mo&s;t complete in&s;anity; he frequently put the &s;nake in his bo&s;om, and took it out again, &s;peaking to it all the while: whil&s;t the crowd, with the mo&s;t profound veneration in their looks, &s;eem|ed ready to wor&s;hip him.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A &s;hort De&s;cription of the Empire of Morocco&mdash;Cu&s;toms and Manners of the Inhabitants; Government, Pun|i&s;hments, Religion, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;The Author and his Companions, by means altogether unexpected, obtain their Liberty and leave the Country in great ha&s;te.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THIS va&s;t empire, including Fez, Tablet, Sus, and the province of Dara, extends &s;ix hundred and twenty miles from north to &s;outh, and &s;ix hundred and fifty from ea&s;t to we&s;t. It is bounded on the north by the Mediterranean &s;ea, on the &s;outh by Te&s;&s;er, and on ea&s;t by Segelme&s;&s;a and Algiers. The Algerines inhabit a large extent of country, extending along the coa&s;t of the Mediterranean four hundred miles, and in breadth from fifty to one hundred. The Turks, who have the government of that country in their hands, are not above &s;even thou&s;and in number, the Moors, or native Afri|cans, have no &s;hare in it. It is a kind of ill-formed republic, under the protection of the grand Signior; but the government may be &s;aid to be totally in the hands of the Jani&s;&s;aries, who advance or depo&s;e, elect or put to death the viceroy at plea&s;ure. They lately murder|ed four, and depo&s;ed two of their deys, and all this hap|pened in the &s;pace of twenty years. Fez, which makes
<PB N="178" REF="035035_0171_100019C21DFB1068">
a part of the empire of Morocco, is two hundred and fifty miles long, and about as many in breadth, bound|ed on the ea&s;t by Algiers, and on the &s;outh by Morocco. The air of this country is mild, temperate, and plea&s;ant, except in the months of July and Augu&s;t, when it is ex|tremely &s;ultry. This country may be &s;aid to have but one harve&s;t, which continues all the year round, for in every &s;ea&s;on one may find grain or fruits of &s;ome kind or other growing in full perfection. At the time I was there, the then emperor, father to the pre&s;ent, appeared to be a man about &s;ixty years of age, &s;ix feet high, maje&s;|tie in his appearance, though mild and gentle in his words and looks. He governed a country, which may be termed the garden of the world; but the nature of the government, and the want of laws, render it a very unplea&s;ant country to re&s;ide in. Liberty, property, life, and death, every thing dear to man, is in the power of the &s;overeign, or his &s;ub&s;titutes. The only re&s;traint upon the will of the monarch, is the dread of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and the va&s;t guard that continually &s;urrounds him, is by no means a &s;ecurity again&s;t &s;uch a cata&s;trophe; for what can be expected from a guard of &s;laves. A people en|joying the &s;weets of liberty, are anxious for the &s;afety of the &s;overeign, that maintains it, but the &s;laves of de&s;|poti&s;m can hardly alter their condition for a wor&s;e. Like the a&s;s in the fable, they mu&s;t carry their panniers, into who&s;e hands &s;oever they fall. The government has a very vi&s;ible effect upon the appearance of the country. Nature does much, but nature is no where &s;econded by arts or
<PB N="179" REF="035035_0172_0FFFF6B4DE23E588">
indu&s;try. Who, indeed, will cultivate fields or plant vineyards under a burning &s;un, unle&s;s he expects to reap the fruits of his labours; be&s;ides the people are the mo&s;t indolent perhaps on the face of the globe. A Moor, in the hot &s;ea&s;on, &s;eems to ri&s;e but little above vegeta|tive exi&s;tence, unle&s;s, indeed, he is mounted on a hor&s;e; but in the exerci&s;e of riding, he is active to an uncom|mon degree. Their hor&s;es, or as they are called in Eu|rope, <HI>barbs,</HI> are famous over all the world for their beauty and unparrallelled &s;wiftne&s;s, and the riders in the management &s;hew the utmo&s;t &s;kill and agility. Few hor&s;es in this country, are put to any kind of drudgery; camels, dromedaries, mules and a&s;&s;es, an&s;wering the pur|po&s;es of carrying burdens. As they are, in a great mea|&s;ure, exempted from the drudgery to which that animal is &s;ubjected in other countries, it is le&s;s to be wondered at, that their breed of hor&s;es has been &s;o long famous. Notwith&s;tanding the extreme lazine&s;s and indolence of the inhabitants of this country, they are enabled to ex|port great quantities of corn, oil, hides, fowls, and fruits, &s;uch as citrons, lemons, oranges, dates, figs, rai&s;ins, al|monds, &amp;c. &amp;c. to Italy, Spain, Portugal, Gibraltar, and many other parts of Europe. They likewi&s;e export &s;ome woolen cloths, leather, which bears the name of the country, indigo, cochineal, o&s;trich feathers, flax, and hemp.</P>
<P>The Mahometan religion, is the religion of the em|pire, and this &s;trictly prohibits the u&s;e of wines and &s;pi|rituous
<PB N="180" REF="035035_0173_0FFFF6B7EFE0BAA8">
liquors; but this prohibition of the prophet is very little attended to by the rich, who indulge in pri|vate, the u&s;e of them, with the utmo&s;t freedom; and the Jews, who are the principal di&s;tillers in the country, and them a plentiful &s;upply. Many European manu|factures have been attempted here, but except the weav|ing branch, few of them have arrived at any perfection. A merchant is a re&s;pectable character in this country; perhaps the more re&s;pected for having the emperor at the head of his cla&s;s; for in every town and village throughout his va&s;t dominions, he has &s;hops kept open, &s;ome of which are managed by Moors, and others by Jews, who are very ready in ca&s;e of fraudulent dealing, to inform again&s;t each other, as a mortal hatred &s;ub|&s;i&s;ts between them.</P>
<P>The inhabitants are obliged to carry arms, if requir|ed, and to march wherever the emperor gives orders; but as I already ob&s;erved, the greater part of the &s;tand|ing army con&s;i&s;ts of &s;laves, and this amounts to one hun|dred thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>The natives of Morocco are &s;warthy and very dark complexioned. The Arabs, who are the Aborigines of this country inhabit the mountains, and have a kind of government of their own. I have already mentioned the circum&s;tance of the emperor's &s;on having gone to head them, and at this time there was &s;omething like di&s;cipline kept up among them, and a kind of traffic
<PB N="181" REF="035035_0174_0FFFF6BCA75EEF08">
carried on between them and the other inhabitants of the country; but this by no means tends to create friend|&s;hip, on the contrary, they hate, de&s;pi&s;e and over-reach one another; and the mountaineers are everla&s;tingly pillaging and de&s;troying the property of the peaceful inhabitants of the plains, to &s;uch a degree, that they have depopulated a great part of this fertile country. The dre&s;s of the mountaineers is very &s;imple. A long coar&s;e woollen robe, thrown about them in a carele&s;s manner, con&s;titutes the whole of it; but this is &s;ufficient to gratify the wi&s;h of unambitious nature; and in this garb, which &s;erves them for every occa&s;ion, they are as happy as the mo&s;t foppi&s;h European, in the co&s;tlie&s;t attire that ever was invented. The clothes of the women are as coar&s;e as tho&s;e of the men, only they have drawers made of linen, and, the&s;e excepted, there is but a &s;mall differ|ence in their dre&s;s. The women have mo&s;t delicate features, but the &s;un gives them a tawny complexion. They &s;pare no pains to plea&s;e the lords of the creation; even the art of painting is not left untried. Where three or four women are, each make it the &s;tudy of the day, to outvie one another, and to be cho&s;en the companion of the night by the man, whom all wi&s;h to plea&s;e; one need not therefore wonder, that every art &s;hould be employed to captivate.</P>
<P>In gaining this point, two pa&s;&s;ions are gratified, and, perhaps, di&s;appointing their rivals is not the lea&s;t agree|able of the two. It is only on particular occa&s;ions the
<PB N="182" REF="035035_0175_100019C5F2CCBED8">
women are allowed to a&s;&s;ociate, or &s;it at table with the men, both poor and rich looking upon them as no bet|ter than &s;ervants, or merely as toys, made for the a|mu&s;ement of the other &s;ex. They &s;pend very little of their time with them by day; but &s;hould an opulent Moor take a fancy to dine with one of his wives, he gives her previous notice of his intentions; and a vi&s;it from a king would not make her exert her talent of plea&s;ing more, than a vi&s;it from her lord and ma&s;ter. The mo&s;t delicate di&s;hes are provided, and all the arts of cookery made u&s;e of to render them palatable. A|mong the higher ranks, a wife is permitted to fit at the table, and partake of the banquet which &s;he has prepa|red; but among the lower orders, the wife &s;tands at the back of her gormandizing hu&s;band, till he has eat his dinner, and then &s;he will perhaps be admitted to take her own.</P>
<P>The Jews form a very large body in this country, though they are kept in a &s;tate of &s;ubordination, which would weary the patience of any other people on the face of the globe but them&s;elves. If any part of a town to is be cleared, the town major &s;ummon&s;es the Jews: and however trouble&s;ome the ta&s;k may be, or whatever their avocations are at the time, they are obliged to at|tend; and during the time they are performing their work, they are abu&s;ed and in&s;ulted with the mo&s;t op|probrious epithets, and often beat unmercifully without any fault. They are obliged to take off their &s;lippers
<PB N="183" REF="035035_0176_0FFFF6C24BBB6B00">
upon pa&s;&s;ing a mo&s;que, or the hou&s;e of a governor, ba&s;haw, or alcaide; and even if they meet any of the a|bove mentioned ranks, they are forced to take them off in the &s;treets. The Jewi&s;h women are generally fair complexioned, open in their countenances, and engaging in their manners. They make con&s;tant u&s;e of paint, in|&s;omuch, that no vi&s;ible part of their body wants its ar|tificial coat.</P>
<P>The Moori&s;h women go con&s;tantly ma&s;ked, but the Jewe&s;es expo&s;e their faces without di&s;gui&s;e or ceremony. The men are dre&s;&s;ed in a long black robe, which covers them from head to foot, with a pair of linen drawers and ve&s;t. Their legs are bare from their knees to the feet, and they wear &s;lippers, which they put their feet into, and can throw them off without any trouble; and this they are obliged to do &s;o frequently, that they ei|ther have them made without any quarters, or never take them up. The dre&s;s of the Jewi&s;h women is not unlike the dre&s;s of an Engli&s;h woman, only before they are married, they never wear any cap or covering on the head, but have their hair plaited down the back, intermixed with &s;ilk of various colours; the richer &s;ort frequently have ta&s;&s;els of gold or &s;ilver hanging down with it. They wear upon their feet &s;mall &s;lippers, which cover the toes, the re&s;t of the feet are bare, only they take care to bedaub them with a very thick coat of paint.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="035035_0177_0FFFBB972FBC7580">The Jews are the only mechanics in the country; and the greater part of the mercantile bu&s;ine&s;s of Mo|rocco is likewi&s;e conducted by them. The genius of a Moor, &s;eldom rai&s;es him to a degree of mediocrity, ei|ther in bu&s;ine&s;s or mechani&s;m. It is to me &s;urprizing that they have ever had any kind of &s;ucce&s;s by &s;ea; as their nautical knowledge is &s;o limited, that it is by ac|cident only, the greater part of their &s;ailors find the way to their own ports. The mi&s;eries of the &s;oldiers, not in actual &s;ervice, are great beyond conception. They are let loo&s;e upon the community, with no more than one ducat, or five &s;hillings &s;terling, per month, to &s;ub|&s;i&s;t upon; and as they are obliged to be ready at a call, they cannot, even if they were qualified, enter upon any kind of bu&s;ine&s;s. Out of this &s;mall allowance, they are obliged to buy all their nece&s;&s;aries, from one or other of the emperor's brokers, who generally take care to fleece them effectually; and it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, the emperor almo&s;t &s;olely engro&s;&s;es this bu&s;ine&s;s, and has agents in every town to carry it on for him. Some Jews, indeed, carry it on upon their own bottom, but not without paying a large &s;um, annually, into the royal coffers; and in this ca&s;e they are allowed to trade with|out interruption, till they have made a good round &s;um of money; which the emperor no &s;ooner hears off, than he falls upon &s;ome method of &s;ecuring it for his own u&s;e. An in&s;tance happened at Mogodore, when I was in the country, which I &s;hall briefly mention.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="035035_0178_0FFFF6C98F6AABA8">A Jew, pretty far advanced in years, had an only daughter, on whom his fonde&s;t hopes were built. He had ama&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable &s;um of money, as a broker, and for this rea&s;on was hated by all the Moors who fol|lowed the &s;ame kind of traffic. They carried daily ac|counts to the governor, of the Jew's great riches; and at la&s;t the governor gave intelligence to the emperor, who immediately &s;ent to demand his daughter, to be taken to the &s;eraglio. The unfortunate Jew could not think of enduring life without the &s;ociety of his darling child. The governor had her taken to his hou&s;e, and the fond father followed in an agony of grief and de&s;|pair. He re&s;olved to try the power of money, and of|fered the governor one hundred dollars, if he would in|tercede with the emperor to have her re&s;tored to him. The governor was glad to find the Jew fonder of his child than his money, and a&s;ked him how much he would give the emperor to buy her off at once. He &s;aid he would willingly give the emperor three hundred, and the governor &s;hould have one for him&s;elf. The young Jewe&s;s was in the mean time kept in the governor's hou&s;e, and her father's propo&s;al &s;ent to the emperor, who agreed to let him have her back again, upon paying one thou&s;and, at which the governor had e&s;ti|mated the whole of his property. The poor old Jew was forced to agree to this inhuman propo&s;al, which &s;tript him of the gains of a whole life time, and redu|ced him to a &s;tate little &s;hort of di&s;traction. After the emperor had received his all, he began to think, that as
<PB N="186" REF="035035_0179_100019CCDB7962E0">
the Jew had &s;ucceeded &s;o well in trade for him&s;elf, it might be very proper to make him an agent for manag|ing his own bu&s;ine&s;s. He therefore, very <HI>generou&s;ly</HI> lent him back three hundred dollars of his own money, to trade under the imperial commi&s;&s;ion. Indeed the Jews are the only people in the country who ever think of a|ma&s;&s;ing money, and are therefore &s;ubjected to every &s;pe|cies of fraud and oppre&s;&s;ion that de&s;poti&s;m can invent. A Moor &s;eldom lays up for a future contingency; if he finds money to an&s;wer his pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ities, he is rich enough, and never thinks of to-morrow.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the inland parts of the country are a harmle&s;s, &s;imple, inoffen&s;ive people, and extremely ho&s;pitable to &s;trangers. They are as poor as oppre&s;&s;ion can make them, but their poverty does not prevent them from enjoying happine&s;s. Naturally indolent, they en|joy the pre&s;ent, without allowing one unea&s;y thought about the future to ruffle their tempers or embitter their pre&s;ent enjoyments. Placed in a luxuriant country, where bountiful nature amply &s;upplies their unambitious wi&s;hes, without much toil or labour on their part, nothing cre|ates an unea&s;y apprehen&s;ion, but the de&s;potic exactions of the government, or the dread of a vi&s;it from their enemies, the mountaineers. The men and women dre&s;s much alike, only the drawers of the latter are longer, and in&s;tead of the turban, they wear a kind of caul upon their heads. The hou&s;e of a Moor is ea&s;ily furni&s;hed, a large carpet or mattra&s;s, &s;pread upon the
<PB N="187" REF="035035_0180_0FFFF6D0341530E0">
floor, &s;erves them for chairs and bed; and there are neither plates, knives, forks nor &s;poons to be &s;een in the hou&s;e. Their meat is placed in the middle, in a large di&s;h, and after wa&s;hing their hands, (which is &s;trict|ly enjoined by the religion of the prophet) they make them an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of knives, forks, and &s;poons. Their meat is generally boiled or roa&s;ted to tatters, &s;o that it ea&s;ily can be divided without the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of a knife.</P>
<P>The woods and de&s;erts are full of &s;avage animals, &s;uch as lions, tygers, wolves, leopards, hyenaes, and large wild bears. From the &s;ervice of the camel, the African derives un&s;peakable advantages. This patient u&s;eful animal, &s;eems to have been created on purpo&s;e for this very country. Through the barren de&s;ert, &s;corched by a burning &s;un, where vegetative life is nipped in the bud; the camel performs his painful journey, under a heavy load; the thi&s;tle or the thorn which he crops as he walks, is all he requires for food. Nature has furni&s;hed him with a re&s;ervoir within, in which he lays up water to quench his thir&s;t; and with this &s;upply he will travel for thirty days together, through never cooling &s;ands, which the dew of heaven &s;carce ever moi&s;tens.</P>
<P>The cows here are &s;mall, and yield but a &s;canty por|tion of milk; but what they give is uncommonly good. The &s;heep are large, but their wool is much inferior to that of Spain. Almo&s;t every quadruped, found in Bri|tain,
<PB N="188" REF="035035_0181_100019CE5DD924D0">
is to be-found here, together with many which we have not. They have al&s;o a variety of fowls, which are unknown to us. Among the&s;e is the <HI>Ca&s;pa-&s;parrow,</HI> remarkable for its beautiful plumage, and the &s;weetne&s;s of its notes. It is allowed to be the mo&s;t melodious of all the winged tribe, but, unfortunately, it cannot ex|i&s;t but in its natural climate. The bays of Barbary, and all round the coa&s;t, abound with a great variety of dif|ferent kinds of fi&s;h. I have bought a fi&s;h, almo&s;t thirty pounds weight, for a piece of money, equal in value to fix-pence &s;terling; and in general, they may be had at the rate of a farthing per pound. The Moors, though poor and oppre&s;&s;ed, are very numerous round the &s;ea coa&s;t. Why they &s;hould give a perference to the out-&s;kirts of the empire, I know not, unle&s;s it be to remove them&s;elves at a di&s;tance from the &s;eat of a government, readier, on every occa&s;ion, to puni&s;h and oppre&s;s than to encourage and protect them; trade with other nations cannot be their motive, as that is but trifling, and they have no ve&s;&s;els of their own, but for plunder and piracy.</P>
<P>Renegadoes, tho' not &s;o numerous here as in Algiers, are not more de&s;pi&s;ed by the Chri&s;tians than the natives. They &s;eldom arrive at places of public tru&s;t or prefer|ment; but are generally employed in the mo&s;t degra|ding offices, and in time of war, they are &s;ure to be placed where there is the greate&s;t danger. Slaves here are very numerous, and their treatment &s;uch as would melt the heart of a &s;avage. In Tunis and Algiers they
<PB N="189" REF="035035_0182_0FFFF6D54F335F68">
&s;uffer much, but it does not equal their &s;ufferings here. They are employed in the harde&s;t and vile&s;t kinds of drudgery, almo&s;t without intermi&s;&s;ion; and their daily allowance is only a pound of coar&s;e barley bread, &s;teeped in oil, which they are obliged to eat without a moment's re&s;t, often holding it in the one hand, whil&s;t they are labouring hard with the other. At night they are loaded with heavy irons, with nothing but cold earth for their bed and pillow. Their dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ts of a long coar&s;e woollen robe, with a hood, which &s;erves them for hat, coat, ve&s;t, breeches, and every thing; for they are neither allowed &s;hoes nor &s;tockings. They are often harne&s;&s;ed in carts with a&s;&s;es and mules, and unmercifully la&s;hed for the very lea&s;t intermi&s;&s;ion from labour. From the readine&s;s of their cruel ta&s;k ma&s;ters, to inflict the la&s;h, one would be led to imagine it the greate&s;t plea&s;ure of their lives.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tians of every denomination, are held in the greate&s;t abhorrence by the Moors; &s;carcely can they mention the word Chri&s;tian, without adding to it the e|pithet <HI>dog,</HI> and cur&s;ing mo&s;t vehemently. Even Euro|pean amba&s;&s;adors have no &s;ecurity again&s;t public in&s;ult, but are &s;ometimes pelted with dirt and &s;tones as they walk the &s;treets. The emperor who has the &s;ole power of life and death, appoints the time, place and manner of all public executions. Sawing a&s;under, either acro&s;s or dividing the body at length, hanging them up by the feet, and roa&s;ting them before a &s;low fire, are the pun|i&s;hments
<PB N="190" REF="035035_0183_0FFFF6DE131325F0">
the emperor frequently inflicts, to the great en|tertainment of the &s;avage populace. The renegadoes are put to death in a &s;till more cruel manner; they have a chain fa&s;tened round their wai&s;t, by which they are dragged from the pri&s;on to the place of execution, where they are anointed all over with boiling tallow, then drawn to a &s;take before a &s;low fire, where they are allowed to roa&s;t while any &s;igns of life appear, and at la&s;t the breathle&s;s body is ca&s;t into the fire. From &s;uch wanton cruelties the mind &s;hrinks back with hor|ror. I &s;hall therefore change the &s;ubject for one le&s;s gloomy, namely, the ceremonial of a Moori&s;h wedding.</P>
<P>In the article of wife, the Koran is very indulgent, and admirably adapted to the voluptuous de&s;ires of men bred in warm climates. It allows to every man as many wives as he is able to maintain; but the generality find two, three, or four at mo&s;t, &s;ufficient for their purpo&s;es. As the &s;exes are kept at a di&s;tance from each other before marriage, a Moor knows very little more of his future bride, than a Briti&s;h king or heir apparent does about his. Some female friend recommends his future help-mate, and he is either obliged to take her upon the word of the go between, or live unmarried. But the latter &s;eldom happens&mdash;his imagination does every thing&mdash;the bargain is &s;truck, and the friends meet to &s;ettle the preleminaries. The bridegroom &s;ends pre&s;ents of the mo&s;t delicious fruits, or what other entertainments he can afford, and thinks proper. The day before the
<PB N="191" REF="035035_0184_100019D009924970">
wedding, the bride invites and entertains her female friends, and the bridegroom his male ones, according to their rank, with mu&s;ic, dancing, and every other a|mu&s;ement they can po&s;&s;ibly command. On the follow|ing morning, the bride appears to her friends, (who then renew their vi&s;it) dre&s;&s;ed out in all the finery her cir|cum&s;tances will admit of, &s;eated on a &s;opha or carpet, &s;urrounded by bride-maids, all as fine as po&s;&s;ible. The contracting parties pa&s;s the day, each, with their friends, in their own apartments; but in the evening the bride is conducted to the hou&s;e of her future &s;pou&s;e, under a veil or canopy, or carried in a &s;edan, and attended by all her female friends. The bridegroom i&s;&s;ues forth with his company, to receive them, dancing to the pipe and tabor. The happy couple are immediately con|ducted to a private apartment, the re&s;t of the company wait till the bridegroom declares him&s;elf &s;atisfied with his bride, when the company parade through every &s;treet in the town, afterwards giving notice, that &s;he went to the arms of her hu&s;band&mdash;a maid. But in ca&s;e anti-nuptial incontinency is di&s;covered, (which indeed very &s;eldom happens to be the ca&s;e) &s;he is &s;ent back to her friends with infamy and di&s;grace, and for ever &s;hut up from the &s;ociety of man.</P>
<P>The Moori&s;h phy&s;icians confine their pre&s;criptions entirely to &s;imples and charms; and perhaps they do as little harm as any others of their profe&s;&s;ion. However that may be, no man is allowed to go out of the world

A &s;olemn phiz is a nece&s;&s;ary qualification, for profe&s;&s;ional men in all countries; and in this qualification the phy&s;i|cians of Barbary are by no means deficient. They at|tend and pre&s;cribe with an infinite deal of grimace; and when, in &s;pite of all their art, they find their patient will e&s;cape from a bad world, and un&s;kilful phy&s;icians, they turn his face to the ea&s;t, and apply for &s;uperior aid, till he expires. They then wa&s;h the body with &s;oap and warm water, and wrap it up in a long coar&s;e robe; and when the friends of the decea&s;ed are informed of the event, they a&s;&s;emble and carry it on a bier to the bury|ing ground; repeating in this, as in mo&s;t of their pro|ce&s;&s;ions, "There is but one ju&s;t God, and Mahomet is his prophet." When the corp&s;e is let down, every one throws &s;omething into the grave, which is generally a &s;tone, till it is filled up, calling out in their own lan|guage, words which &s;ignify, "Light of God," and ac|companying every je&s;ture with violent outcries and la|mentations for the death of their friend.</P>

At fir&s;t they are obliged to &s;erve in the in|fantry, and after continuing in it &s;o many years, or per|forming &s;ome action worthy of preferment, they are ad|vanced to a corps of cavalry, which in this country is e&s;teemed great military preferment. Their education is &s;olely confined to the u&s;e of arms, and the manage|ment of a hor&s;e. Trained from early life to pay an im|plicit re&s;pect to the commands of their &s;uperiors, they know nothing but to obey. Their &s;oldiers are variou&s;ly armed, one part of the cavalry have a gun, pi&s;tol, and &s;cymet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r, and another mu&s;kets and lances.

The naval force of this country is, as I already ob&s;erved, on a very de&s;picable footing, con&s;i&s;ting only of &s;even badly rigged ve&s;&s;els, little better than entire wrecks. The admiral-&s;hip, which is the large&s;t, mounts twenty-&s;ix guns, and when they are not cruizing, &s;he, with other two, lies con&s;tantly at Mogodore, four of the re&s;t winter at Larache, and one at Salce. They com|monly are laid up in the month of October, and again begin the bu&s;ine&s;s of piracy, or crui&s;ing, in March or April. It is perhaps a happy circum&s;tance for Chri&s;tian traders, that in all the dominions of Morocco, there is

not one good port. If their ports were better, they would in all probability, make a much greater figure at &s;ea, and be a &s;till greater &s;courge upon the re&s;t of the world; but be&s;ides this, they are extremely ignorant of the art of &s;hip building, in want of proper timber, tackling, &s;ails, and anchors, and have neither powder nor &s;hot, except what they receive from England or Holland.</P>
<P>The Moors are Mahometans of the &s;ect of <HI>Molech,</HI> and are, perhaps, the mo&s;t &s;uper&s;titious people in the world. They enforce, by the mo&s;t rigid puni&s;hments, attendance upon public wor&s;hip. Their mo&s;ques are open every day; but the Sabbath, or day of re&s;t, is Friday. The women are never &s;uffered to enter the mo&s;que, as they are &s;uppo&s;ed to attract the attention of men, and fill their minds with impure thoughts; and as they imagine they were only created for the plea&s;ure of man, and the propagation of &s;pecies, they have no con|cern in the bu&s;ine&s;s of religion.</P>
<P>The Mahometans enter the mo&s;que barefooted, and are &s;aid to behave with the utmo&s;t decency and decorum during their &s;tay there. In ordinary life they are high|ly exemplary in many re&s;pects.

<P>By this time I &s;uppo&s;e, the reader will imagine I have totally forgot my narrative; and yet I can a&s;&s;ure him, I had no wi&s;h to &s;tay any longer in this country than I could po&s;&s;ibly get clear of it. He may remember, I told him of the plan of our liberation &s;ugge&s;ted by Mr. Grif|fiths, in the contemplation of which, we were making our&s;elves happy. A circum&s;tance however happened, which thwarted that de&s;ign, and led, if not to a &s;peedier, at lea&s;t to a &s;afer relea&s;e. We had been about fourteen months in the country, when the Spani&s;h am|ba&s;&s;ador arrived, bringing with him fifteen Moors, who had been taken and detained &s;ome time by the Spaniards. The&s;e were not the only pre&s;ents he brought to the emperor. He brought a great variety of European cu|rio&s;ities,
<PB N="196" REF="035035_0189_0FFFF6EF0B8347E8">
which he valued more than men, be&s;ides a large &s;um of money. His pre&s;ents were graciou&s;ly received by the emperor; and this prince, like &s;ome of the ea&s;tern monarchs of old, de&s;ired him, to ASK WHAT HE WOULD AND IT SHOULD BE GRANTED HIM. With a gene|ro&s;ity, which did honour to his feelings, he a&s;ked a pre|&s;ent, which the emperor could very well &s;pare, and which &s;hewed that the high character he &s;u&s;tained, had not made him unmindful that he was a man&mdash;it was liberty for the Chri&s;tian pri&s;oners confined at Mogodore, belonging to Frances, Spain, and America. The emperor very readily granted his reque&s;t, and next day di&s;patch|ed a caravan to bring us all to Morocco. The caravan arrived at Mogodore the very day, on the evening of which, we were to &s;eize, and run off with the Portugue&s;e &s;chooner, as Mr. Griffiths had directed, and orders were &s;ent for us to &s;et out immediately, as the caravan was to go eighteen miles out of town that day.</P>
<P>We were totally ignorant of the favourable turn our affairs had taken, and &s;uch a me&s;&s;age, at &s;uch a time, was wor&s;e than death to us. We made our&s;elves certain that the emperor had &s;old us for &s;laves to &s;ome other ma&s;ter, and gave up all thoughts of ever &s;eeing our dear native countries more. Me&s;&s;rs. Bain and Hutchi&s;on had befriended us to the la&s;t, and now, with heavy hearts we bade them adieu. Mr. Griffiths entered ju&s;t as we were about to depart, we told him our &s;orrowful tale, but he very good naturedly told us, he had a pre&s;enti|ment
<PB N="197" REF="035035_0190_0FFFF6F52F8E4160">
that the emperor meant to grant us our liberty. This kind hearted fellow came along with us four miles out of the town, &s;aying every thing his friendly heart could &s;ugge&s;t, to remove our &s;u&s;picions and lighten our &s;orrow. We parted from him, not without &s;hedding tears, and pur&s;ued our journey. For five days we tra|velled through a country already de&s;cribed, almo&s;t &s;tarved for want of food, and on the &s;ixth we arrived at Morocco, when we were &s;hewn to our former re&s;idence, and left till next morning to our own unplea&s;ant reflec|tions. About eleven o'clock next day, we were all &s;ent for to the emperor's pre&s;ence, who was that morn|ing reviewing a part of his troops, &s;eated in an elegant little model of an European hou&s;e, &s;ent him by the king of Spain, and brought over by the amba&s;&s;ador already mentioned.</P>
<P>It con&s;i&s;ted of four apartments, in one of which was a bed, elegantly furni&s;hed. The frame was mahogany, the floor marble, and the roof was covered with a kind of blue marble which &s;erved for &s;late; and all round the door and windows was adorned with gilt bra&s;s, which in that country pa&s;&s;ed very well for &s;olid gold. Upon this pre&s;ent the emperor &s;et a high value; and I doubt not, it contributed confiderably to the procuring of our liberty. We approached him with the profounde&s;t re|&s;pect, which we expre&s;&s;ed by bowing almo&s;t to the ground. With a half &s;mile in his countenance, he ad|dre&s;&s;ed us by his interpreter: "I hope your bondage

here has been ea&s;y&mdash;you are now at liberty&mdash;I have made a pre&s;ent of you to the king of Spain, and to-mor|row you &s;hall depart with his amba&s;&s;ador. When you go to Rabat, you will receive cloaths, and at Tangiers you &s;hall have tho&s;e that were taken from you&mdash;you may depart." Never did I hear &s;uch cheering accents, the joy they occa&s;ioned was almo&s;t too much for me to bear with moderation: I would have danced, &s;ong, and ca|pered like a madman, had not the pre&s;ence of this &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or to Mahomet kept me within &s;ome kind of bounds. The number of pri&s;oners, upon whom this favourable &s;en|tence was pa&s;&s;ed, were thirty, and certainly this day was not lo&s;t to Sidi Mahomed, emperor of Morocco, who had in the cour&s;e of it made thirty human beings completely happy. What his feelings were on the occa&s;ion I can|not determine, or whether he thought at all about the matter, I know not; but from what I felt then, and for|merly, I could have wi&s;hed for the &s;upreme power of that country, for one day in the year, that I might annually, on that day, have enjoyed the luxury of making the wretched happy.</P>
<P>We were without ceremony hurried from the pre|&s;ence of the emperor, and &s;hewn into that of our hu|mane deliverer, who in the mo&s;t cordial manner, took us each by the hand, and congratulated us upon the e&s;cape we had made from bondage, a&s;&s;uring us, at the &s;ame time, that he would loo&s;e no time in conveying us out of the country, and that till he had accompli&s;hed this,
<PB N="199" REF="035035_0192_0FFFF6FCF7D47B00">
he did not think us &s;afe. The caravan was ordered to be in readine&s;s at &s;ix o'clock in the morning, and at that hour we were all prepared; but ju&s;t as we were a|bout to &s;et out, a guard arrived from the emperor, with orders to detain all the pri&s;oners belonging to France, as the emperor had determined po&s;itively, that none from that kingdom &s;hould leave his dominions till their king &s;ent an amba&s;&s;ador to &s;olicit their freedom. The Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador delayed, for &s;ome hours, entering upon his journey, wi&s;hing to inform him&s;elf, if it was po&s;&s;ible to per&s;uade the emperor to revoke his orders; but he found there was no hope on that &s;core, and there|fore thought it be&s;t to &s;et off, lea&s;t the emperor &s;hould recall us all; and &s;o great was the intere&s;t he took in our behalf, that, during a journey of four hundred miles from Morocco to Rabat, he &s;carce allowed either him|&s;elf or us to have a rea&s;onable time either to eat or &s;leep, le&s;t the emperor &s;hould &s;end after us, and deprive him of the plea&s;ure of carrying us to Europe. Our ha&s;te de|prived us of the very great plea&s;ure we promi&s;ed our|&s;elves in calling upon the Sardinian con&s;ul, who had been &s;o much our friend in the time of need; but our pre&s;ent chance of freedom was not to be trifled with, and as we had nothing to repay his kindne&s;s with but words, we followed our leader, who thought it un&s;afe to &s;top at Rabat, or Salee, but carried us, on the evening of the tenth day after we &s;et out, &s;even miles north of the latter. During all this journey we had never, at any one

time, &s;topped &s;ix hours, the benevolent amba&s;&s;ador, be|ing always more afraid for us than we were for our&s;elves.</P>
<P>The caravan con&s;i&s;ted of about one hundred Chri&s;|tians, and two hundred Moori&s;h cavalry, commanded by a ba&s;haw and two alcaides. There were likewi&s;e one hundred Jews &s;ent with us, to &s;trike our tents, fill our water-pots, &amp;c. and one hundred camels to carry our provi&s;ions. We arrived at Tangiers the nineteenth day after our &s;etting out, happy once more to reach a port which contained a ve&s;&s;el ready to carry us to Europe. The amba&s;&s;ador would not allow us to &s;top for a mo|ment a&s;hore, being &s;till afraid the emperor might change his mind and &s;end after us. We therefore went imme|diately on board the ve&s;&s;el, in which we were to &s;ail for Suto, a Spani&s;h &s;ettlement on the coa&s;t of Barbary, where we were to perform quarantine for fourteen days, before we &s;ailed for Spain. After an impri&s;onment of fifteen months, expo&s;ed to &s;o many hard&s;hips, and with &s;carcely the mo&s;t di&s;tant hope of ever being relea&s;ed, my reader will ea&s;ily conceive it filled our hearts with the mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite plea&s;ure, to find our&s;elves once more at liberty, and likely to revi&s;it our native lands.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>SUTO is an i&s;land, or rather penin&s;ula, on the Bar|bary coa&s;t, a little above Gibraltar, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the king of Spain, to which all criminals bani&s;hed from Spain, are exiled; and indeed few of any other de|nomination are to be found on it be&s;ides the bani&s;hed and their offspring, it is but &s;mall, though &s;trongly for|tified. In the middle is a hill, at the foot of which &s;tands a town; adjoining to this, there is an excellent bay, at the head of which is a pier about one hundred yards long, which &s;mall ve&s;&s;els can lay their &s;ides too, but tho&s;e of a larger &s;ize lie in the bay. During the fourteen days we had to &s;tay here, we were allowed to go a&s;hore as often as we thought proper, and in every re&s;pect to be our own ma&s;ters, and di&s;po&s;e of our&s;elves as we judged proper; the amba&s;&s;ador all the while &s;up|plying us with plenty of provi&s;ions. We were, how|ever, in a wretched condition for want of cloaths, hav|ing got no &s;upply &s;ince we entered Morocco. The em|peror,
<PB N="202" REF="035035_0195_0FFFF7072D7CF178">
it is true, had promi&s;ed us a &s;upply at Rabat, and our own at Tangiers, but we were in too great ha&s;te to be out of his dominions, to &s;top to demand them, and the fate of the French pri&s;oners had made us &s;omewhat &s;u&s;picious, that a regard to his word was not to be nam|ed in the catalogue of his virtues. It was very lucky for us that we were in a mild climate, where much cloathing was not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and the thoughts of having regained our liberty made up for every thing.</P>
<P>At the end of fourteen days, a frigate arrived from Spain to carry us to Cadiz, on board of which we em|barked, and performed our voyage in twenty-four hours. On board the frigate, the &s;ailors all &s;trove who could mo&s;t oblige us, and every one was anxious to get our hi&s;tory; as we could conver&s;e with them tolerably in their own language, we were able to gratify their cu|rio&s;ity, by relating the mo&s;t remarkable circum&s;tances. We no &s;ooner landed than the ambo&s;&s;ador took us a&s;hore and pre&s;ented us to the governor, and the American con&s;ul. Our dre&s;s, as may ea&s;ily be conceived was not the be&s;t in the world, and not altogether proper for vi&s;iting. With a de&s;cription of my own, as it will be very &s;hort, I &s;hall pre&s;ent my reader; and this with a little alteration may &s;erve for every one's in the com|pany. I had on the body and part of the &s;leeves of an old check &s;hirt, part of a pair of trow&s;ers which had once been new, but now &s;erved more for the purpo&s;es of mode&s;ty, than for &s;helter from the cold, and this was

all; jackets, hats, &s;hoes, and &s;tockings, had long ago de|&s;erted their &s;tations; and this was the wardrobe we brought with us to Europe. The governor &s;urveyed us with commi&s;erating looks, but gave us no cloathing; and after he had conver&s;ed &s;ometime with the amba&s;&s;a|dor, apart, he told us, we mu&s;t &s;tay at Cadiz till the king was appri&s;ed of our arrival, and &s;hould grant us our liberty.</P>
<P>Di&s;patches were &s;ent off to Madrid, and as we con|&s;idered our&s;elves the property of the king of Spain, we thought we had no right to take any &s;teps without his con&s;ent or orders. We, therefore, re&s;olved to wait with patience, in hopes that his an&s;wer, would &s;et us at full liberty to pur&s;ue our own inclinations. We were a&s;&s;igned a hou&s;e for our re&s;idence, with a pi&s;tareen each, for our daily maintenance, which furni&s;hed us with two good meals, which we took at eleven and four o'clock, and thought our&s;elves extremely happy in having for &s;auce to them, the air of a Chri&s;tian country. Here we had no re&s;traint put upon our inclinations, and con|&s;equently walked through the town &s;eparately or to+gether, as we plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>One day as I was walking by my&s;elf in a &s;treet lead|ing to the bay, I was acco&s;ted by a man in a &s;ailor's garb, who told me, he thought my face was familiar to him, and de&s;ired to know my name. As &s;oon as I mentioned it, he &s;eemed much confounded. "Heavens!" &s;ays

he, "in what plight do I meet with you? What unkind fortune drove you to this &s;hore, in this mi&s;erable &s;itua|tion?" I immediately gave him the outlines of my hi&s;|tory, without recollecting the features of the per&s;on to whom I directed my di&s;cour&s;e. After I had fini&s;hed, I reque&s;ted he would let me know his name, and when he had gratified me, how &s;urprized was I, to find that he was one of my earlie&s;t acquaintances in life, who had been for &s;ome years my &s;chool-fellow. He a&s;ked me to go on board his &s;hip, promi&s;ing me the fight of a num|ber of my old acquaintances; I cheerfully complied with his reque&s;t, and found almo&s;t every per&s;on on board ac|quainted either with my&s;elf or my friends, for the ve&s;&s;el was from Greenock, and mo&s;t of the hands from that part of Scotland.</P>
<P>A long ab&s;ence from my native country made me anxious to hear news of my relations and acquaintances, and after &s;atisfying me on this head to the utmo&s;t of their power, they went and &s;upplied me with &s;uch cloaths as they could &s;pare, and I &s;tood mo&s;t in need of. One brought me a jacket, another trow&s;ers, another a hat, another a pair of &s;hoes. In &s;hort, in a very little time I was as well rigged out as I could rea&s;onably have de&s;ir|ed, and after pa&s;&s;ing a few hours in the company of my benevolent countrymen, I returned to the companions of my adventures, altogether a different man, in appear|ance, from what I had left them. They were not a little &s;urprized at the figure I cut, and wondered much how I

came by my pre&s;ent rigging I &s;oon &s;atisfied them on that head. Good fortune, &s;ays &s;omebody, &s;eldom come by halves. I took a walk to the harbour next day, and &s;auntering along in a carele&s;s manner, I was again ac|co&s;ted.&mdash;A &s;ailor made up to me, and a&s;ked me my name and country. I &s;atisfied him in both, and at his reque&s;t told him part of my misfortunes. Looking &s;ted|fa&s;tly in my face, with a &s;mile, he a&s;ked me, if I did not know him? I told him I did not. "My name," &s;ays he, "is Hutchi&s;on, I was born within a few miles of your father's hou&s;e, and I mu&s;t beg you to go on board our &s;hip, and allow me to help to rigg you." We accord|ingly took a boat, and went on board, where I received the kinde&s;t treatment during my &s;tay, which was very &s;hort, as they were preparing to get under way.</P>
<P>My good friend Hutchi&s;on gave me a jacket, a pair of &s;tockings, a &s;hirt, and two dollars. This was the fir&s;t time I had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o much money &s;ince my ar|rival in Europe. I therefore re&s;olved my companions &s;hould &s;hare it, and &s;ending for wine to the amount of it, I told them, I would give them a treat, which they were a little &s;urpri&s;ed at, not knowing that I was the riche&s;t man in the company. Next morning one of our company told me, he meant to be my companion for the day, as he looked upon me to have run away with the good luck of all the company. We accordingly &s;et out, but after travelling till five o'clock, we neither met with an acquaintance, nor with any accident worthy of re|cording.

In the evening, after having fatigued our&s;elves in que&s;t of we knew not what, we were returning home, when a per&s;on &s;urpri&s;ed me by giving me a hearty &s;lap on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e &s;houlder. I turned ha&s;tily about, and di&s;covered, to my great &s;atisfaction, our old friend Mr. Griffiths, the Portugue&s;e pilot, formerly mentioned. I never in my life recognized an old acquaintance with more &s;incere joy. "You will be a little &s;urpri&s;ed," &s;ays he, "to find me in this country, but I have been in more towns than Tepherary, and botheration to me, if I am not happy to find that you have got out of the hands of the black complexioned emperor by fair means, for if you had made your e&s;cape by running off with the &s;chooner, as I propo&s;ed, and any of his cor&s;airs had laid hold of you afterwards, I would not have given a roa&s;ted potatoe for your chance. But where are your companions? &s;hew me to them, and let me welcome them all to a Chri&s;tian country." We made the be&s;t of our way to out lodgings, and Griffiths would &s;carce &s;peak to any of my me&s;&s;mates, till he ran out and brought us &s;ix bottles of wine, over which we di&s;cour&s;ed till towards evening. He told us he was now at liberty to accompany us to America, as he had quitted the Portugue&s;e &s;chooner, and might go where he plea&s;ed. "But," &s;ays he, "if it &s;hould be long before di&s;patches arrive from Madrid, I will go before you, and tell them you are coming." We parted with our good friend in the highe&s;t &s;pirits, and this good-natured fellow continued to vi&s;it us every day du|ring our &s;tay Cadiz.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="035035_0200_0FFFAFA4A286B6F0">It was not long till an order came down from the king of Spain to have us all &s;ent to America, in the fir&s;t &s;hip that &s;hould &s;ail, at his expence, as he wi&s;hed to pay a compliment to his new allies. Mr. Griffiths had not, during this time, found a pa&s;&s;age to the New World, and we were daily favoured with more or le&s;s of his com|pany, and now we entertained the pro&s;pect of being fellow pa&s;&s;engers in the &s;ame &s;hip. My countrymen too, who had &s;o kindly &s;upplied me with cloaths, came one day to vi&s;it us, and told us their &s;hip had been &s;old the day before, and that they had formed a re&s;olution of accompanying us to America. A French &s;hip was &s;oon to &s;ail, and the governor &s;ending for us, told us he had orders to find us a pa&s;&s;age in her, and provi&s;ions for Vir|ginia. As we looked upon this province as our home, we were happy to hear of our being landed there, and waited the hour of our departure with &s;ome degree of impatience.</P>
<P>In the mean while we &s;pent our time very happily to|gether. The Briti&s;h &s;ailors, who had been paid off when the &s;hip was &s;old, &s;hared with us the fruits of their labours; and this, with our own allowance, made us live comfortable and ea&s;y. But &s;till we were unemployed; and the bread that is purcha&s;ed at the expence of ano|ther, never has &s;o &s;weet a reli&s;h in the mouths of men, who have inclination and ability to labour for them&s;elves, as that which is earned by their own indu&s;try.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="035035_0201_0FFFF5FFED867310">Our &s;tay at Cadiz being ten weeks, I was enabled, not only to view every curio&s;ity in this place, but to in|form my&s;elf of the nature of the country, and of the manners of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>Spain is the mo&s;t we&s;terly kingdom of Europe, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;urrounded by the &s;ea, except on the &s;ide adjoining to France, from which it is &s;eparated by the Pyrenean mountains. On the ea&s;t and &s;outh it is bounded by the Mediterranean, the Straits of Gibraltar, and part of the Atlantic, and on the north by the bay of Bi&s;cay, and Pyr|renus. It is &s;ituated in the the temperate Zone, between the thirty-&s;ixth and forty-fourth degrees of north lati|tude, and is in length from the tenth degree of we&s;t longitude, to the third degree of ea&s;t longitude, being thirteen degrees from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and nine from north to &s;outh.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t writers, who have undertaken to de&s;cribe this country, have, in my opinion, done it very great inju&s;|tice, by repre&s;enting the &s;oil as entirely barren. It mu&s;t be allowed, the exports from it are &s;o trifling, that peo|ple but little acquainted with the country, may readily conjecture, that there is but little can be got to export, e&s;pecially if they are natives of Britain or America, where they are accu&s;tomed to &s;ee the hu&s;bandman make the mo&s;t of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. But in fact the fault lies not &s;o much with the &s;oil as the inhabitants.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="035035_0202_0FFFF6029DAA7F68">It is impo&s;&s;ible for a per&s;on, who has never been in Spain, to conceive the liftle&s;s, indolent appearance of the cultivators of the &s;oil. Labour of any kind &s;eems to be their greate&s;t puni&s;hment. The ruling feature of the Spaniards is pride, or &s;tateline&s;s of appearance&punc; which I really believe has no particular effect upon the heart, for I imagine the duties of humanity are as well under&s;tood, and practi&s;ed among them, as they are among many of their neighbours: but this &s;tateline&s;s of appearance, and affectation of grandeur, pervades all ranks and condi|tions; and even prevents the pea&s;ant from giving that attention to labour which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, not on|ly for the cultivation of the country, but for the relief of his own mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t barren mountain in the country will pro|duce &s;omething for the &s;ervice of the community; but the extreme indolence and pride of the inhabitants, will not allow them to cultivate even tho&s;e parts of the coun|try, which with the &s;malle&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance, would yield the mo&s;t luxuriant produce. The riche&s;t and mo&s;t delicious fruits are to be found in almo&s;t every plain, the &s;ponta|neous productions of nature: but tilling the ground, &s;owing the &s;eed, and reaping the autumnal fruits, are drudgeries which the indolent Spaniard can by no means &s;ubmit to, &s;o that it is no uncommon ca&s;e to &s;ee a family half &s;tarved the greater part of the year, who have thou&s;ands of acres lying without cultivation, producing

nothing but food for the bea&s;ts of the earth, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ls of heaven.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible that the nature of the government may be unfavourable to indu&s;try; it undoubtedly will be &s;o in Spain, and every other country where the rights of people are not under&s;tood nor a&s;certained; where the monarch can &s;eize at his plea&s;ure, the fruits of the hu&s;|bandman's labour; and wherever an embargo is laid up|on human rea&s;on by a numerous ho&s;t of clergy, &s;warm|ing all over the country, with the profe&s;&s;ed intention of preventing man from exerci&s;ing the right which he de|rives from heaven&mdash;of judging for him&s;elf. But the&s;e unfavourable circum&s;tances, can never fully excu&s;e the extreme indolence of the people, who would rather &s;tarve than labour, who have the faire&s;t portion of the globe parcelled out to them, and can neither &s;upply them&s;elves nor others. Of late years it has been the fa&s;hion to de|cry nobility, but their cla&s;s has never been on &s;o de&s;pi|cable a footing in any country as in Spain. When I &s;ay this, I only mean in the eyes of people who have not the &s;ame exalted ideas of that cla&s;s, as the Spaniards en|tertain; for a Signior in Spain, without knowing where, or how to come by a &s;upper, demands and obtains that re&s;pect, which the riche&s;t Indian nabob would receive from a populace, fond of paying every attention to the man who brings to his native country rupees enough to gratify his own avarice, and his countrymen's vanity. A good deal of Quixoti&s;m &s;till exi&s;ts in Spain, but if
<PB N="211" REF="035035_0204_0FFFF60A460C5AE8">
this &s;pirit has its ab&s;urdities and inconveniencies, it is productive of many good con&s;equences. A Spaniard carries about with him an exalted &s;oul; a mean or unge|nerous action he can neither commit him&s;elf, nor endure in another. He pays a profound re&s;pect to the other &s;ex. The &s;erious air with which he conducts him&s;elf may not, perhaps, be &s;o congenial to the wi&s;hes and expecta|tions of a young woman, as the lively ratling way of a Frenchman; but if a Spaniard profe&s;&s;es to be in love, his mi&s;tre&s;s may give him credit: whereas the warme&s;t ad|dre&s;&s;es of a Frenchman, pa&s;s with the other &s;ex as &s;o many in&s;tances of unmeaning gallantry. I would not be thought to in&s;inuate, that an illicit commerce does not take place between the &s;exes in this country, as often as in tho&s;e countries where they are le&s;s ceremonious. No part of the globe has furni&s;hed more frequent in|&s;tances of amourous improprieties and follies than Spain, nor have they in any other country, been attended with more fatal con&s;equences. Jealou&s;y is a powerful ingre|dient in the compo&s;ition of a Spaniard. His wife or daughter he guards with a watchful eye. Locks, bolts, and duennas are employed as barriers to keep them from the &s;ight of man. But &s;ome how or other it happens, that the ca&s;tles mo&s;t carefully guarded, are ea&s;ie&s;t taken. Women are the &s;ame I &s;uppo&s;e, in all countries, and un|le&s;s &s;omething is left to their own mercy, nothing can ever be made of them.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="035035_0205_0FFFF60F665AA250">The Spani&s;h ladies completely verify the truth of this ob&s;ervation.

<P>The &s;tateline&s;s of the Spaniard is manife&s;t even in the article of dre&s;s. Their cloaths are generally of a dark colour, and they wear long black cloaks over all, which give them a very &s;olemn appearance; but this is only the dre&s;s of the common people. The nobility and fa&s;hionable part of the kingdom, have for &s;ome time pa&s;t, in a great mea&s;ure, adopted the dre&s;s and manners of the French: &s;o that in the higher circles, the Span|iard has fallen off con&s;iderably from his natural character.

This has made them li&s;tle&s;s and indolent in the cultivation of a country, which, with the &s;malle&s;t indu&s;try, would be a &s;ource of certain wealth, comfort and happine&s;s.</P>

by preventing the increa&s;e of population; and when to the&s;e con&s;iderations we add the va&s;t emigrations to A|merica, which annually take place, we cannot wonder that this fertile country &s;hould neither be half peopled nor cultivated.

<P>We were all &s;ummoned to appear on board the French &s;hip one evening when we little expected it. Accord|ingly we repaired each to our quarters, happy in the thoughts of once more revi&s;iting the land of liberty. There were fourteen Briti&s;h and American pa&s;&s;engers, nine Frenchmen, which was the number of the hands, and our old friend Griffiths, who had kept his re&s;olution of accompanying us to Virginia. With a favourable breeze we left the bay of Cadiz, for the we&s;tern world, and pa&s;&s;ed the Madeiras on the &s;ixth day after our de|parture. But on the &s;eventh our favourable breeze left us, and a gale blew from the &s;outh; which, neverthele&s;s, allowed us to lay on our cour&s;e.</P>
<P>We had this wind for fourteen days, when it removed to the ea&s;t, and would &s;carcely carry us through the water three knots an hour. Our captain, who was the mo&s;t complete puppy I ever &s;ailed with, began to tell his men he mu&s;t put them all to &s;hort allowance, as the pa&s;|&s;age was like to be tedious. He immediately put his threat in execution, and began to feed his hands

with hor&s;e beans, at every meal, and, except now and then, we were enabled to &s;pare them a &s;mall mor&s;el of our allowance, this was the whole of their fare.</P>
<P>Our pa&s;&s;age proved mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing; frequent gales reduced us to the utmo&s;t extremity. Our captain was as ob&s;tinate as a mule, and would not be advi&s;ed by any one on board, con&s;equently, our dangers were fre|quent, and our pa&s;&s;age, in even &s;en&s;e of the word, di&s;|agreeable.</P>
<P>We had no concern in the management of the &s;hip, but were like &s;o many pa&s;&s;engers on board of tran&s;ports; and every one of my readers, who has been in that &s;it|uation, knows that it is not the mo&s;t eligible.</P>
<P>Our pa&s;&s;age was tedious, but at la&s;t we di&s;covered the land; about midnight, &s;ome of the hands giving the welcome intelligence, we all got upon the deck, and could &s;ee the American &s;hore, to the &s;outh of Cape Henry. At day-break we got a pilot on board, and proceeded up the bay.</P>
<P>Four days afterwards we arrived at Alexandria, and were met and welcomed by every one in the town, who knew, or had ever heard of us. Every one was anxious to hear the &s;tory of our captivity, to relieve our wants, and make us forget our long and painful bondage. On our part, we were no le&s;s happy to meet with our old
<PB N="218" REF="035035_0211_0FFFAEDF0C546AF8">
friends, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> plea&s;ing reception we met with, half-compen&s;ated for all our &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>An American has very little of the Frenchman about him. His invitations are not ceremonious, but they are from the heart. Many invitations we were obliged to refu&s;e, for this day at lea&s;t, as we had agreed among our&s;elves, before we ca&s;t anchor, to make our fir&s;t vi&s;it to a hou&s;e where we were all acquainted, in order to &s;pend the day all together. Thither we went, and were im|mediately &s;urrounded by almo&s;t every per&s;on in the town, who had the &s;lighte&s;t acquaintance with any of us.</P>
<P>We &s;pent the mo&s;t plea&s;ant day I ever experien|ced. I had yet neither got my&s;elf rigged out with cloaths, nor any birth to enable me to make money to purcha&s;e them; but I was in the land of liberty, plenty and peace, I never be&s;towed a thought on to-morrow, and ragged as I was, like the fir&s;t pair in paradi&s;e, I knew not that I was naked. We told our &s;ufferings to a multitude of both &s;exes, and many of our female friends, like De&s;dimonia, "loved us for the dangers we had pa&s;&s;ed:" and "we loved them that they did pity us." After &s;pending a very jovial afternoon, we &s;allied forth into the &s;treets, and in walking down to the river, I was met by an old ac|quaintance, one Farria, mate of a brig which traded to Philadelphia. I did not like to make my&s;elf known to him, and therefore took to the other &s;ide of the &s;treet, but I could not pa&s;s unnoticed. He immediately ran
<PB N="219" REF="035035_0212_0FFFF6238DEE8358">
to me, and took me by the hand. I had divided all the clothes I had got, among my me&s;&s;mates, and con&s;equently my pre&s;ent appearance did not by any means indicate affluence. "Heavens!" &s;ays he, "what a figure you are! Where have you been? Have the Turks laid hold of you, and left you no better cloaths? I live, &s;ays he, near by, here is the hou&s;e, (pointing to a &s;tore that &s;tood on a wharf) I will not take you from your friends now, but beg I may &s;ee you to-morrow, and I will give you new rigging." I was highly plea&s;ed with the offer, and re|&s;olved to accept of his invitation.</P>
<P>We went back to the hou&s;e we fir&s;t entered, and &s;pent the evening to our mutual &s;atisfaction. Our friend Griffiths, who was the merrie&s;t man in the company, helped to enliven us all, by mixing every now and then a &s;troke of that humour, which his countrymen bring from the cradle, and by giving us a bottle of wine to enable us to reli&s;h it. For my own part, I enjoyed that evening a happine&s;s to which I had long been a &s;tranger, and often ble&s;&s;ed the memory of Columbus, for having di&s;covered a country, where &s;o much peace, harmony, liberty and plenty, may be attained without any violent exertions to come at them.</P>
<P>The next day we were &s;ent for to the hou&s;e of our owner, colonel Howe, who received us with the warm|e&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of joy for our deliverance. He told us, he had made &s;everal applications to Congre&s;s about pro|curing
<PB N="220" REF="035035_0213_0FFFF62514B08240">
our liberty, and was willing to have paid half our ran&s;om out of his own pocket; a per&s;on, he &s;aid, was actually nominated to go and treat for our freedom, when the news arrived of our having obtained it by means of the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador. He enquired parti|cularly about the treatment we had received, and fini&s;h|ed the interview by putting into the hands of each, a pre&s;ent of eight guineas. This was a &s;ea&s;onable relief to us all, for my own &s;hare I laid out a part of it on &s;uch cloathing as was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ent, and as my fortune had been &s;o very indifferent in this quarter of the globe, I determined at all events to &s;ee my native country. A new ve&s;&s;el was upon the &s;tocks here, getting ready for Briti&s;h owners. The captain was a countryman of my own, and I re&s;olved to go as a hand to Port-Gla&s;gow, whither &s;he was bound. It was the middle of the bleak month of December before we were ready to &s;ail, and on the fourteenth of that month we left Alexandria, after I had taken leave of all my friends, particularly of Mr. Griffiths, whom I left be|hind with the utmo&s;t reluctance; but he was re&s;olved, he &s;aid, never to revi&s;it Ireland till he could purcha&s;e a few acres of land, and a little cabin to lay up in du|ring the winter of life. We had a part of our cargo to take in at Yeokomaco, and it was not till the fifth of January that we got all ready for &s;ailing. We &s;ailed down the &s;pacious bay of Che&s;apeek, and took our de|parture from Cape Henry with a favourable breeze. At midnight, however, we were alarmed with a call of
<PB N="221" REF="035035_0214_0FFFAEE98FDAF1D8">
"All hands;" and running upon deck, found both pumps employed, and from three to four feet water in the hold. After labouring at the pumps for &s;ome hours, we could perceive we were gaining ground, and at la&s;t got the ve&s;&s;el almo&s;t dry. At day break, to our great joy, we di&s;covered a &s;ail &s;teering the &s;ame cour&s;e with our&s;elves. We hove too for her coming up, and upon her nearer approach, found her to be the John, of Hull, bound for that port; we told them our condition, and begged they would &s;tay by us for a day or two, to which the captain agreed. During all this time we were con|&s;tantly employed at the pumps, but we re&s;olved to run every ri&s;k rather than de&s;ert her; and telling captain Brown, of the John, our re&s;olution, he wi&s;hed us a good voyage, and left us.</P>
<P>During the whole of our pa&s;&s;age, one pump was kept almo&s;t con&s;tantly employed; but our &s;hip was new, our &s;ails and rigging good, the wind was fair, and the hopes of a quick pa&s;&s;age made us &s;ubmit the more readily to ince&s;&s;ant toil and fatigue. The twenty-third day after our departure, we ob&s;erved the water change its colour; and trying for &s;oundings, we found, to our great comfort, that we were in eighty fathoms water, and in one day more di&s;covered the land to the &s;outh of Dublin. The &s;trong gale we had for &s;ometime been favoured with, &s;till continued, and carried us rapidly up the channel, and we landed at Port-Gla&s;gow the twenty-&s;ixth day af|ter our departure from Cape Henry.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="035035_0215_0FFFF62CCB89F2F0">Thus was I once more landed in my own country, rich in experience, but without any other kind of pro|perty; and to mend the matter, the captain refu&s;ed paying a farthing of my wages unle&s;s I returned to Vir|ginia in the ve&s;&s;el. I never could wor&s;e afford to &s;ub|mit to &s;uch a lo&s;s.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A Voyage to Canada.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I had not been many weeks at home, when I found my&s;elf weary with the want of employment, and al|together out of my element. I therefore, re&s;olved to embrace the earlie&s;t offer of going again to &s;ea, and an opportunity &s;oon offered from a port in the neighbour|hood, to vi&s;it a part of America, which I had never yet been in, namely Canada.&mdash;Four miles north of Irvine, lies Saltcoats, a &s;mall &s;ea-port town, the trade of which is under the in&s;pection of the Irvine cu&s;tom-hou&s;e. From this port a &s;hip was &s;oon to &s;ail for the above-mentioned country; and hearing they were in want of hands, I went and engaged as one. We took on board a loading of coals, to be delivered at Cork, and on the thirteenth of March, 1787, I again &s;et out for the New World. On the nineteenth we had got within about a day's &s;ail of the Cove of Cork, when the wind veered &s;uddenly round to the &s;outh, and blowing very hard, we found we &s;hould not long be able to contend with it; there|fore we bore away for Dublin harbour, which we could &s;till command. On the hill of Howth, which lies at the mouth of the bay, is an excellent light-hou&s;e, which &s;tanding high &s;hews light at a very great di&s;tance at &s;ea,
<PB N="224" REF="035035_0217_0FFFF6359C917230">
and as night was fa&s;t approaching, and the tide an&s;wered, we thought this our wi&s;e&s;t cour&s;e, and accordingly reach|ed the harbour in &s;afety.</P>
<P>Being got into this harbour, we thought it be&s;t to di&s;po&s;e of our cargo; and having done this, we took in balla&s;t, and pur&s;ued our voyage to Cork, where we were to take in provi&s;ions for the Briti&s;h army in Canada. Upon the fir&s;t of April we &s;ailed from Dublin, and on the third we ca&s;t anchor at the town of Pa&s;&s;age. We were employed till the &s;eventeenth in getting our load|ing on board, and on the eighteenth we &s;ailed from Cork, with a &s;teady and favourable breeze.</P>
<P>On the twentieth we took our departure from Cape Clear, and directed our cour&s;e for the river St. Laurence. At this &s;ea&s;on of the year in Britain, the winter gene|rally is over, and the weather grows milder; but we were bound to a country where winter pays a longer vi&s;it. We continued our cruize, and on the eighth of May we judged, by the extreme coldne&s;s of the weather, that we could not be far from the coa&s;t; but on the morning of the ninth we found our&s;elves &s;urrounded by &s;everal i&s;lands of ice, which convinced us the gulf was not yet pa&s;&s;able. On the tenth we came in &s;ight of &s;e|veral &s;hips, &s;ome of which were froze up, and could not move. We began to be alarmed for our own &s;afety, and making every exertion in our power, we at la&s;t got clear, and meeting with the Mentor of London, the
<PB N="225" REF="035035_0218_0FFFAEF76D371E78">
captain informed us of his having been in company with twenty other merchantmen, who had been frozen up for &s;ometime, and that he him&s;elf had been fourteen days in that condition, and had &s;u&s;tained con&s;iderable damage from the ice, in&s;omuch, that he was obliged to throw a con&s;iderable part of his cargo overboard, in order to find out the holes made by it. He likewi&s;e told us, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to reach our port, and for his part he meant to run for &s;ome port in Newfoundland, and wait till the body of the ice broke. Our captain thought it prudent to follow his example, and accordingly we both made the be&s;t of our way for Port-Amboy, a com|modious harbour for the &s;afety of &s;hips; but the coun|try is uninhabited in the neighbourhood, except in the fi&s;hing &s;ea&s;on, when the fi&s;hermen re&s;ort to it. It is &s;ituated in nearly forty-five degrees north lat. and is fif|ty-nine degrees we&s;t of London. Here for a few days, we occupied our time in fi&s;hing and fowling, finding plenty of divertion in either line; &s;carce a day pa&s;&s;ed over our heads that we did not kill great numbers of ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e, ducks, partridges and pigeons, which &s;warm all over this country; and when tired of this exerci&s;e, we took to the amu&s;ement of fi&s;hing.</P>
<P>One day in walking along the &s;hore, our captain could perceive &s;omething at a di&s;tance like part of a &s;hip's wreck, and returning to the ve&s;&s;el, we hoi&s;ted the long-boat, and made towards the place, and upon coming up to it, e&s;pied four pieces of cannon; with part of the
<PB N="226" REF="035035_0219_0FFFF63A29C6D300">
ropes, &s;ails and rigging of a &s;hip. The&s;e we got on board of the boat, and returned to the &s;hip, well plea&s;ed with our prize.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we lay here, our fleet was daily augmenting till the twenty-fourth, when a French ve&s;&s;el arriving, told us that they had come down from St. John's, and that the gulf was perfectly clear. Upon hearing this, we prepared for &s;ailing, and early next morning we weighed anchor, and &s;tood up this immen&s;e gulf, till on the twenty-eighth, we arrived at Quebeck the capital of Canada, where we came to anchor. The river at Que|beck is not above one mile broad, though at the i&s;land of Orleans which is only a little below, it is in breadth four or five leagues, and from the river narrowing thus &s;uddenly, the city is &s;aid to take its name; <HI>Que-beck,</HI> in the Indian language, &s;ignifying a &s;traight or narrow place. Our captain immediately went a&s;hore, and was ordered by an agent from the victualling office, to weigh anchor again, and &s;ail for Montreal, as the garri&s;on there was in great want of provi&s;ions. As the wind was fair no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was to be lo&s;t; we therefore &s;et &s;ail next day. Twenty leagues above Quebeck the tide began to a|bate, and con&s;equently the current again&s;t us was very &s;trong.</P>
<P>The di&s;tance from Quebeck to Montreal is about one hundred and &s;eventy miles. On the banks of this river the hou&s;es are &s;o plentiful; that it appears like one
<PB N="227" REF="035035_0220_0FFFF640AA5E7750">
continued village. Large plantations, and gentlemen's &s;eats appearing in continual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. After pa&s;&s;ing the i&s;land of Riclieu, the weather became &s;o extremely mild and plea&s;ant, that we began to think our&s;elves tran&s;ported into another climate. The i&s;land of Mon|treal is about thirty miles in length, and twelve in breadth. The town is built at the foot of a mountain, about half a league from the &s;outh &s;hore. It is &s;urrounded by a wall, flanked with eleven redoubts, which &s;erve in&s;tead of ba&s;tions. The ditch is eight feet deep, and proportionably wide. Here is al&s;o a citidel, the batteries of which command the &s;treets of the town, from one end to the other. The town is divided into two parts, the upper and the lower, in the la&s;t of which merchants, mechanics, and men of bu&s;ine&s;s re&s;ide. The hotel-dieu, the royal magazines and armoury, are likewi&s;e placed here. In the upper|town however, are the principal buildings, &s;uch as the palace of the governor, the pari&s;h church, and free-&s;chool, be&s;ides many other piles which have a princely appear|ance, and the neighbourhood has a beautiful a&s;pect; the whole adjoining country being cultivated and inter|&s;per&s;ed with many delightful villages. The harbour is formed by a &s;mall i&s;land, which lies at a convenient di&s;|&s;tance from the beech, and forms a very &s;afe port. A number of large ve&s;&s;els may lay their broad &s;ides to the beach, &s;o that there are no wharfs, as in mo&s;t of the American ports.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="035035_0221_0FFFAF15A6A474C0">Two miles below Montreal are the <HI>rapids,</HI> a declivity of the river, where the current runs &s;o &s;trong, that &s;hips frequently lie a long time before they can get over, hav|ing to wait for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a &s;trong ca&s;terly wind. This current often runs at the rate of eight or nine miles in an hour, and ve&s;&s;els frequently take &s;ix or &s;even weeks to perform a voyage from Quebeck to Montreal, though we were lucky enough to accompli&s;h it in thirty-&s;ix hours. On our arrival, we found the garri&s;on had very urgent demands for provi&s;ions, and as we were the fir&s;t victualling &s;hip that had reached the port for the &s;ea&s;on, we met with a welcome reception. The troops joyful|ly a&s;&s;i&s;ted us in di&s;charging our cargo, and in a very &s;hort time we were clear. We employed our&s;elves for a few days in cleaning the &s;hip, and overhauling the rigging, and then took on board part of another cargo, con&s;i&s;ting of wheat, and were to &s;top to complete our quantity at Quebeck.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the month of July we left Mon|treal, and had a mo&s;t delightful pa&s;&s;age down a river, either &s;ide of which exhibited a country adorned with nature's mo&s;t elegant vegetable productions. Here the &s;pring is rapid in its progre&s;s, and a few days will alter the appearance of the country &s;o much, that one can &s;carcely know it for the &s;ame; and were not this the ca&s;e, in its &s;hort &s;tay, it would be inadequate to the provi|ding again&s;t a long and dreary winter, which generally is prolonged for eight or nine months of the year.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="035035_0222_0FFFF64337414768">We had to touch at the lake of St. Thomas, but be|ing unacquainted with the channel, we run our ve&s;&s;el aground; but as the bottom was of &s;oft clay, we got off without any material damage. Next morning we found out the right channel, and as we meant to take in a &s;mall quantity of wheat here, we &s;ent our boat a&s;hore, and in the cour&s;e of the day had what wheat we were to re|ceive all put on board, and next morning we proceed|ed for Quebeck, where we arrived &s;afe.</P>
<P>On the morning after our arrival, I had liberty to go a&s;hore, and my fir&s;t excur&s;ion was to &s;ee the ground where the brave general Wolf, in the moment of victory, courageou&s;ly fell, fighting for his country. I &s;urveyed the remains of the ditches and entrenchments which had been formed on the memorable occa&s;ion. On the &s;pot where the general fell, is the remains of a &s;mall monu|ment erected to his memory. I approached the hal|lowed &s;pot with re&s;pect, and felt within me a &s;ecret pride that I could call my&s;elf a Briton.</P>
<P>Leaving the plains of Abraham, I viewed the ground on which the French army had been encamped, which is a beautiful level, under the protection of the city forts. The back part of Quebeck is enclo&s;ed by a wall about &s;ixteen feet high, and on the top is placed a row of cannons, at regular di&s;tances.&mdash;The harbour is flank|ed with two ba&s;tions, above one of which is a demi|ba&s;tion, and on the &s;ide of the gallery of the fort, is a

battery of twenty-five pieces of cannon; above this a|gain, is a &s;quare fort, called the citadel; be&s;ides the&s;e, there are &s;everal other large batteries and fortifications, which would render the taking of this place a very dif|ficult enterpri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t con&s;iderable towns in Canada, are Quebeck, Trois Riviers, and Montreal; but Quebeck is the capi|tal. It contains from &s;even to eight thou&s;and inhabi|tants, and was begun to be built by the French in the year 1608, who had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country in the year 1525, and retained it till 1759, when it was conquered by the Briti&s;h, and confirmed to them by the peace of 1763. This city is divided into the upper and the lower towns. The banks of the hou&s;es of the latter are placed again&s;t a rock, on which the former &s;tands, and an ea&s;y a&s;cent is made from the one to the other, by &s;teps cut out of the rock, for foot-pa&s;&s;engers, and at another place by a gentle declivity, which opens a pa&s;&s;age for all kinds of vehicles.</P>
<P>Here is an Epi&s;copal palace, which &s;tands upon as plea&s;ant a &s;ituation as imagination can conceive.&mdash;On one &s;ide of an elegant &s;quare &s;tands a cathedral, and on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide a Je&s;uit college; the re&s;t of the &s;quare is filled up with very hand&s;ome buildings. The ho&s;pitable is plea&s;antly &s;ituated, and contains two wards, one for men and the other for women. There is likewi&s;e a con|vent, which at this time was &s;aid to contain a con&s;ider|able

number of devotees. To de&s;cribe every &s;quare and public building would be an endle&s;s ta&s;k, I &s;hall there|fore clo&s;e the de&s;cription of this city, and give a &s;hort &s;ketch of the country.</P>
<P>The neighbourhood of Quebeck, and indeed all the banks of this large river, is beautiful beyond de&s;crip|tion. At this enchanting &s;ea&s;on of the year, the mo&s;t luxurious foliage covers the fields, and the meadows &s;end forth the mo&s;t delicious flavour. Pears, peaches, plumbs, and apples, with many other kinds of fruit, are here produced in the greate&s;t abundance. Wheat is &s;own in the month of May, and reaped in the month of Augu&s;t. The rivers and lakes are full of fi&s;h of va|rious kinds, which furni&s;h the inhabitants with a con|&s;tant &s;upply. This is the appearance of the country in &s;ummer; but alas! their &s;ummer is but &s;hort-lived, and their winter produces an awful rever&s;e; then the rivers are all frozen up&mdash;all intercour&s;e by means of naviga|tion is totally at an end. For &s;ix, &s;even or eight months, every field is covered with &s;now, frozen as hard as the &s;urface of the water. The half-frozen inhabitants can hardly find fuel to keep them&s;elves from &s;tarving. All this happens in a latitude, which in Europe is moderate and plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>The Indians of this country, with whom the Euro|pean &s;ettlers carry on a con&s;iderable trade, are account|ed very tractable and humane.&mdash;They are, during the
<PB N="232" REF="035035_0225_0FFFF64D87D33450">
&s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, to be found upon the river &s;ailing in all directions, in little canoes, in which they generally carry about with them all their families, they are ex|tremely fond of &s;pirituous liquors, and a gla&s;s or two of brandy, &s;ea&s;onably given them, will often help the dealer to a very advantageous bargain. So long as they can by any means obtain this, they are &s;ure to be in|toxicated, and will &s;tay as long in a place as any kind of liquor is to be had in it, and then betake them&s;elves to their wild habitations.</P>
<P>The&s;e aborigines of the country, carry on a kind of barter with the European &s;ettlers, by furni&s;hing them with beaver, deer &s;kin, &amp;c. in return for which they receive trinkets, and toys of various kinds, coar&s;e duffles, blankets, hatchets, tomahawks, liquors, and to|bacco. The &s;kin of a beaver is one con&s;iderable article of trade from this country to Britain.&mdash;The natural hi&s;|tory of that animal is &s;o well known, that I &s;hall not at|tempt a particular account of it. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that in regulating and conducting the bu&s;ine&s;s of their commonwealth, and in con&s;tructing their winter habi|tations, they not only leave all other gregerious animals, but even man him&s;elf in his natural &s;tate, greatly be|hind them. The Newfoundland dogs, are remarka|ble over all the world for their &s;agacity, fidelity, and u&s;efulne&s;s. They are employed in this country for ma|ny dome&s;tic purpo&s;es, and perform the ta&s;k required of them, with a wonderful degree of exactne&s;s and atten|tion.
<PB N="233" REF="035035_0226_0FFFF650971F3850">
They can ea&s;ily be taught to carry any thing committed to their care, wherever they are directed. They have carts and harne&s;&s;ing made on purpo&s;e, in which they will tran&s;port a large loading to a con&s;ider|able di&s;tance. By their a&s;&s;i&s;tance the butcher and baker are enabled to convey, with ea&s;e, their goods to their different cu&s;tomers. Ma&s;ters of ve&s;&s;els, by their means, have all &s;orts of provi&s;ions brought to their &s;hips; fami|lies are by the &s;ame means &s;upplied with water and with fuel. In &s;hort, this faithful dome&s;tic, with a little training, an&s;wers &s;o many purpo&s;es, and is &s;o u&s;eful, both by land and water, that an extirpation of the &s;pecies would be a very &s;erious misfortune to this country.

<P>The reptile race is at lea&s;t as numerous here as in o|ther parts of North America. The rattle-&s;nake, in par|ticular, &s;eems to thrive remarkably on this &s;oil. They &s;ometimes are found of the amazing length of fourteen, fifteen, and &s;ixteen feet, with a proportionable thickne&s;s. Fortunately, however, the noi&s;e they make in moving, prevents the bad effects that would otherwi&s;e happen, as they are certain to give warning of their approach, by the rattling of their tail, by which means the travel|ler is enabled to avoid their venomous bite.&mdash;The al|mo&s;t inexhau&s;table fore&s;ts here, produce a variety of dif|ferent kinds of trees. The pines, which are of two

&s;orts, the red and the white, from both of which pitch and tar may be extracted; &s;everal kinds of firs, which grow to an amazing &s;ize, and furni&s;h excellent ma&s;ts for &s;hips; the cedar and the oak are likewi&s;e both di&s;tingui&s;hed by the qualities of white and red; and the maple, which generally grows on an elevated &s;ituation, and makes ex|cellent hou&s;hold furniture, is likewi&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed by the qualities of male and female. But it would be an endle&s;s ta&s;k to particularize the various &s;orts of trees and vegetables, which cover the face of this wonderful coun|try. I &s;hall therefore proceed with my narrative.</P>
<P>In a few days our loading was completed at Que|beck, and we lo&s;t no time in weighing anchor. We &s;ail|ed down the river about thirty leagues, when we &s;top|ped for &s;ome time to take in &s;pars. We ca&s;t anchor, and &s;even of us, among whom was the captain, went a|&s;hore and began to cut down trees; but we had not been long at work, when our captain, who was at &s;ome di&s;tance, came running to us breathle&s;s, and calling up|on us to make ha&s;te, as a large body of Indians was at no great di&s;tance. None of our number had a mind to tru&s;t to their mercy, we therefore, with all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te got our trees into the water, and tying them toge|ther as well as we could, got into the boat; but we then di&s;covered that one of our comrades was a mi&s;&s;ing: we waited for him in the mo&s;t dreadful &s;tate of anxiety; none of us being hardy enough to venture through the woods in que&s;t of him. At la&s;t we e&s;pied him running towards

as with all his might, and reaching the &s;hore, he lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d into the boat, begging us for heaven's &s;ake to pull of, as the Indians had e&s;pied him, and were following. He had &s;carcely uttered the&s;e words when a great number of them came in &s;ight, but before they e&s;pied us we had made off from the &s;hore, to which they came with all imaginable ha&s;te, and &s;houted, and made &s;ignals for us to put back; but as we did not know whether their inten|tions were friendly or ho&s;tile, we thought it mo&s;t pru|dent to return to the &s;hip. As &s;oon as we had got on board, they lighted up a fire on the &s;hore, and placing them&s;elves round it, began to di&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ch &s;ome kind of food, after which they all ro&s;e and began to dance to a &s;ort of mu&s;ic; but as none of us had the lea&s;t inclination to mix in the dance, we immediately &s;et &s;ail, and had a very a|greeable pa&s;&s;age down the river.</P>
<P>We again entered the immen&s;e gulf, and having made cape St. George, the wind &s;etting in from the &s;outh ea&s;t, began to blow very violently. We &s;tood to the north ea&s;t, but could only carry a fore&s;ail; when we got &s;o near the land as to di&s;cern what part of it we were oppo&s;ite to, we wore the &s;hip and &s;tood out again, but the flood-tide dragged us rapidly towards the botto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f the bay, where we mu&s;t inevitibly have been da&s;he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to pieces.

being to the bay of Cadiz, where we were to deliver our cargo. Nothing remarkable happened du|ring a very plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;age; we reached Madeira on the twenty-eighth of Augu&s;t, and then directed our cour&s;e for cape St. Vincent, the mo&s;t we&s;terly point of Spain, lying in lat. thirty-&s;even degrees, and longitude nine, we&s;t of London. This cape we made on the &s;ixth of September, and arrived at Cadiz on the ninth. We did not get product, or liberty to land, till the twelfth.</P>
<P>Our captain during the time of our di&s;charging, en|deavoured to procure a freight either up the Mediter|ranean, or to the coa&s;t of Barbary, but could not &s;ucceed for either. We were therefore, obliged to take in bal|la&s;t, and proceed up the Mediterranean to Alicant, where we expected to get a cargo of &s;alt for Cork. Upon the fifth of October we left Cadiz, and &s;tood for Cape Spar|teel, or the mouth of the gulf, which we made on the &s;eventh. Here the current always runs ea&s;tward, and if the wind happens to be from that direction, it makes a very crooked &s;ea. Very luckily for us we had a &s;trong gale from the we&s;tward, and upon the eleventh we found by our ob&s;ervation that we were right abrea&s;t of Ali|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">t, which is &s;eated at the bottom of a deep exten&s;ive bay of the &s;ame name.

<P>Alicant is remarkable for the flavour of its wines, and the excellent fruits of all kinds it produces.

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A Voyage to the Hebrides, Denmark, and Pru&s;&s;ia.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE extreme de&s;ire of &s;eeing the world, by which I had ever been governed, was not yet abated, what I had &s;een &s;erved but the more to increa&s;e it; my only &s;tudy was how to vary the &s;cene. I had &s;een the manners of the &s;outhern nations, and now wi&s;hed to ex|amine tho&s;e of the northern. I had not been long at home till an opportunity pre&s;ented it&s;elf of gratifying my de&s;ire. A brig, from the Clyde, was to &s;ail for Copenhagen and Memmil, and as this was a voyage greatly to my mind. I engaged as a hand. We &s;et &s;ail, with a favourable wind for the Hebrides, a group of i&s;lands on the we&s;t of Scotland. The &s;afe&s;t and readie&s;t pa&s;&s;age to the north, lies through the&s;e i&s;lands, as, in ca&s;e of a &s;torm, &s;hips can always command a port to take &s;helter in, all the Hebrides being furni&s;hed with excel|lent harbours, be&s;ides almo&s;t every kind of provi&s;ions, &s;uch as mutton, fowls, fi&s;h and eggs, which are both plen|tiful and cheap.</P>
<P>In the&s;e latitudes the weather is often tempe&s;tuous to a great degree; many ve&s;&s;els keep to the we&s;tward of them altogether, and by that means are deprived of
<PB N="240" REF="035035_0233_0FFFF66DE33970D8">
&s;helter in the hour of danger, and not unfrequently lo&s;e both their lives and ve&s;&s;els. Among the&s;e i&s;lands the wind blows in tremendous gu&s;ts, but the intervals be|tween them, are &s;o calm, that one may expo&s;e a light|ed candle in their hand, without its being extingui&s;hed. But &s;hips run very little ri&s;k, for if the wind &s;hould be unfavourable for one pa&s;&s;age it generally an&s;wers for a|nother, and in the&s;e &s;ounds or channels, there are very few in&s;tances of any dangerous accidents happening. The mo&s;t &s;outherly of the&s;e i&s;lands are Ju&s;a and Ila, in the la&s;t of which is a fre&s;h water lake, with an i&s;land in the middle of it, on which may &s;till be &s;een the ruins of a large building, &s;aid to have been built by Donald, king of the I&s;les. Between the&s;e two i&s;lands is the entrance, known by the name of the Sound of Ila. In &s;ailing to the northward the i&s;land of Mull makes its appearance, which is about twenty-four miles long, and near twenty broad. Further north lies Lewis, which is &s;eventy miles we&s;t of the main land of Scotland, and is eighty miles in length, and forty-one in breadth; and Barra, which is five miles long, and three broad. Cod and ling are caught here in great quantities, and &s;everal &s;mall ve&s;&s;els come to the i&s;land la&s;t mentioned, in the &s;ummer, and return laden with fi&s;h.</P>
<P>We came to anchor in the harbour of Stornway, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land of Lewis, which is extremely commodious; and in the town of Stornway, which con|tains about one hundred hou&s;es, provi&s;ions are plentiful
<PB N="241" REF="035035_0234_0FFFF67416400798">
and cheap. The weather &s;etting in &s;tormy, we were forced to lie here for fourteen days, during which time I had an opportunity of informing my&s;elf of the man|ners of tho&s;e i&s;landers, and of mixing with &s;uch &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ty as the place afforded.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the&s;e i&s;lands &s;till retain a won|derful degree of veneration for their chiefs, or heads of their clans.&mdash;No Jew ever valued him&s;elf more on his de&s;cent from the father of the faithful, than one of the&s;e i&s;landers does, if by any means he can trace back his de&s;cent from &s;ome lord of a clan; and this they will go back through fifty generations to make out; and though poor as oppre&s;&s;ion can make them, they a&s;&s;ume a con&s;e|quence, from their illu&s;trious de&s;cent, that makes up for the want of more &s;ub&s;tantial gratifications. Happy is the man who has had the good fortune to be born a <HI>Mac Donald,</HI> a <HI>Mac Pher&s;on,</HI> or a <HI>Mac</HI> of any kind; in the&s;e i&s;lands he is &s;ure to meet with &s;ome illu&s;trious cou&s;ins. Their dre&s;s perhaps may but ill accord with their noble extraction, but clothes are but trifles, their views are more exalted. Allow them to tell you over their illu&s;|trious pedigree, and whil&s;t they are doing it, enliven their &s;pirits with a gla&s;s of u&s;quebaugh, or a pinch of &s;nuff, and the ragged Hebredian becomes as great a man as the cham of Tartary.&mdash;The&s;e remains of feudal idol|atry, however, are beginning to wear out among the ri&s;ing generation; and as trade and manufactures get footing in the Hebrides, the&s;e ideal advantages will pro|portionably
<PB N="242" REF="035035_0235_0FFFF676A22AF2C0">
fall in their value. At pre&s;ent their princi|pal trade, as well as food, is drawn from the ocean; and did the indu&s;try of the inhabitants, keep pace with their nece&s;&s;ities, they might thence extract va&s;t &s;ources of wealth: nature has brought the means to their doors, but they are extremely indolent in the application of them. Accu&s;tomed to humble fare, and coar&s;e apparel, their wants are few and &s;oon &s;upplied. They ri&s;e in the morning without many wi&s;hes, and go to bed with the &s;atisfaction of having them gratified. Indolent as they are in application to bu&s;ine&s;s, no men in the world make better &s;oldiers, or endure the fatigues of a pain|ful campaign, with more un&s;haken patience and re&s;o|lution; hunger, thir&s;t and fatigue, are unable to van|qui&s;h their undaunted &s;pirits. Let their leaders be cho|&s;en from their own country, and no degree of danger can affright them. When they choo&s;e to exert them|&s;elves, they &s;hew a wonderful degree of agility and acti|vity, and nothing gives &s;uch life to their motions as the &s;ound of the bagpipe. Every chieftian, or great man, has a bagpiper of his own, who entertains him and his dependents with this animating mu&s;ic, and while he plays over the <HI>peebroch</HI> or <HI>&s;trath-&s;pay,</HI> unle&s;s his audience were tied hand and foot, it would be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to keep them from dancing. Their coar&s;e food is gene|rally little indebted to the cook, nor is cleanline&s;s much attended to among them; they are, however, kind and ho&s;pitable to &s;trangers, fond of &s;hewing them eve|ry civility in their power, and you cannot more oblige
<PB N="243" REF="035035_0236_0FFFF679B22C6410">
them, than by &s;itting down without ceremony, to par|take of their humble repa&s;t. Their expert trade con|&s;i&s;ts almo&s;t entirely of fi&s;h, but this is trilling to what it might be if the people were indu&s;trious, or were put upon proper methods of taking the va&s;t &s;hoals that vi&s;it this coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Leaving the we&s;tern i&s;les, we directed our cour&s;e for the Orkneys, another group of i&s;lands on the north of Scotland, &s;eparated from the main land by the tempe&s;|tuous &s;traits, called Pentland Firth, which is twenty-four miles long and twelve broad. The inhabitants of the&s;e i&s;lands have been long vi&s;ited from almo&s;t every nation in Europe, con&s;equently they have in a great mea&s;ure lo&s;t the originality of manners which once cha|racterized them; and their language begins to be mixed with that of other nations. They have in particular, borrowed &s;everal words from the Dutch, who, during the fi&s;hing &s;ea&s;on, con&s;tantly re&s;ort here.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t every Greenland &s;hip calls here, whether outward or homeward bound, for the purpo&s;e of laying in fre&s;h provi&s;ions, which are both plentiful and very cheap; al&s;o ve&s;&s;els to and from the different ports in the Baltic, &s;o that in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, the inhabi|tants of the Orkneys have no want of company. But in winter, thick clouds, darkne&s;s and &s;torms, continu|ally hang over them. In the months of June and July they can &s;ee to read ordinary print at midnight. Four

months of the year is all the time they have for bu&s;i|ne&s;s, for in the &s;hort vi&s;its the &s;un pays them in winter, he is &s;o exceedingly &s;hy, that they derive very little ad|vantage either from his light or heat, and the weather is generally &s;o very tempe&s;tuous, that they can but &s;eldom vi&s;it one another, much le&s;s their neighbours on the main land.&mdash;The number of i&s;lands is twenty-eight; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> taking in the very &s;mall ones, they will amount to forty. From the&s;e i&s;lands two members are &s;ent to the Briti&s;h parliament, one for Orkney and Zetland, and the other for the burghs of Kirkwall, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In Kirkwall, the capital of the Orkneys, there re|mains entire, a fine Gothic building, formerly a cathe|dral, and now the pari&s;h church. It is &s;upported by fourteen pillars on each &s;ide, and is &s;teepled by four. It has three gates, checquered with red and white &s;tone, embo&s;&s;ed and elegantly flowered.&mdash;I need not &s;pend the time of my reader in an account of a people who are already &s;o well known, I &s;hall therefore proceed with my narrative.</P>
<P>After waiting at Stormne&s;s for &s;ome time, we &s;et &s;ail with a fine &s;outh-we&s;terly wind, and pa&s;&s;ing through Ham-Sound, directed our cour&s;e for the Naze in Nor|way, which we made in two day's &s;ailing; from thence we &s;ailed along the mouth of the Catigate, and made the penin&s;ula of Jutland. Nothing material happened us during the re&s;t of our pa&s;&s;age, till we arrived at Co|penhagen,
<PB N="245" REF="035035_0238_0FFFF683E8C3DA20">
the capital of Denmark, where we had to di&s;charge our cargo, which detained us for &s;everal weeks, during which time I had an opportunity, as my cu&s;tom was wherever I went, of viewing what app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">d worthy of notice in the city.</P>
<P>The excellency of the harbour, and its advantageous &s;ituation for trade, cannot be &s;urpa&s;&s;ed. It is guarded on both &s;ides by &s;trong fortifications, and the entrance is &s;o narrow, that one &s;hip only can enter at a time; and when once &s;hips get in they are perfectly &s;ecure either by night or by day; for at night the harbour is &s;ecured by a &s;trong boom laid acro&s;s the mouth of it, and chain|ed at both ends. This large commodious harbour can contain four or five hundred ve&s;&s;els, and is &s;ur|rounded by a wooden gallery, to which &s;hips may lay their broad &s;ides, and where every ve&s;&s;el has her ap|pointed &s;tation.&mdash;Were we to judge of the power or revenues of a monarch from the extent of his domin|ions, the king of Denmark would make a very con&s;pi|cuous figure among the potentates of Europe. His titles are, <HI>King of Denmark and Norway, and of the Goths and Vandals; Duke of Hol&s;tein, Oldenbourg and Delmenhor&s;t:</HI> of all of which he is the actual &s;overeign.&mdash;But the va&s;t territories he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, are by no means populous, in proportio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as they are exten&s;ive; and the greater part of the inhabitants are in a &s;tate of real indigence, and in what is commonly looked upon by other European nations, as a &s;tate of real mi&s;ery.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="035035_0239_0FFFF688906AD9B0">The kingdom of Norway is of a va&s;t extent, being no le&s;s than eight hundred miles long, and one hundred broad. It is inhabited by amphibious animals in the &s;hape of men, who, during the &s;hort &s;ummer, are con&s;tantly employed in catching and eating fi&s;h; and in winter &s;leep, or do what they plea&s;e. Here, in the &s;pace of &s;ix weeks they both &s;ow and reap, but a long and dreary winter &s;ucceeds, and for nine months of the year the ground is covered with &s;now. The pitiful inhabitants then retire to their mi&s;erable huts, and dream away an uncomfort|able winter, without variety or enjoyment. If ever there was nece&s;&s;ity for a man choo&s;ing an agreeable com|panion for life, it is here: for in this uncomfortable part of the globe, his wife is for three-fourths of the time his only companion. The &s;now &s;huts him up from all his neighbours; and if he is not happy at home, mi&s;erable indeed mu&s;t be his &s;ituation.&mdash;One thing re|markable in this country is, that all animals of chace, &s;uch as hares, rabbits, deers, &amp;c. are entirely white; and even any of tho&s;e animals taken from Britain, in the cour&s;e of one &s;ea&s;on change their colour; &s;o that none of them in Norway, are to be found after a few months re&s;idence, in the &s;ame coloured garb in which they fir&s;t vi&s;ited the country.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this kingdom are numerous, bar|ren as it is. They multiply fa&s;t; and the nature of the climate, and the food they make u&s;e of, I imagine, are no ways unfavourable to propagation. I need not men|tion
<PB N="247" REF="035035_0240_0FFFF68CA797E128">
to my readers, that the climate is beyond endurance cold, and the greater part of their food is fi&s;h. The king of Denmark, therefore, has a numerous body of men yearly propagated in the&s;e his Norwegian domin|ions; and if the maxim be true, that the riches of a kingdom depend upon the number of its inhabitants, he has no rea&s;on to complain of poverty. I am apt how|ever to imagine, that men introduced into the world, in the &s;tate his Dani&s;h maje&s;ty &s;ubjects vi&s;it it, can do very little either for them&s;elves or their &s;overeign. They are produced, it is true, by their parents, and nur&s;ed by their mother, from the &s;ame principal, or in&s;tinct, (if my reader will allow the term) that the bears &s;uckle their offspring, and &s;o their care is at an end. The father in|&s;tructs them as &s;oon as they are capable, in the my&s;te|ries of handling the oar, and &s;triking the fi&s;h; and when he has perfected them in the&s;e manly exerci&s;es, he gives up the rein, and leaves them to the direction of Pro|vidence.&mdash;Learning is not much known or coveted. It is not the fa&s;hion of the country to train up philo&s;ophers, metaphy&s;icians, or divines.&mdash;Poets however there are, who relate the legendary tale, in numbers deemed har|monious: and no people under heaven have &s;o great a ta&s;te for poetry of the marvellous ca&s;t, or tell a &s;tory &s;o much in the &s;tile of ea&s;tern improbabilty, and in &s;uch per&s;ua&s;ive language, as the Norwegian poet, or dra|mati&s;t.&mdash;It is certain, mankind expre&s;s mo&s;t forcibly the pa&s;&s;ions which they feel mo&s;t acutely. Savage nations have, without the aid of refinement or education, &s;ung

<P><PB N="251" REF="035035_0244_0FFFF6987A46CED8">Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, is &s;eated in the i&s;land of Zealand. This i&s;land, the re&s;idence of the royal family, is nearly of a circular form, mea&s;uring a|bout &s;ixty leagues in circumference. The channel, cal|led the Sound, divides it from Sohonin, a province of Sweden. The &s;oil is by no means fruitful, e&s;pecially in dry &s;ea&s;ons, on account of its &s;andy foundation; notwith&s;tanding the people make all their own bread, but this is the only grain produced here, &s;ufficient for the con&s;umption of the inhabitants. There is not one river of any con&s;equence in this i&s;land, and but few brooks or rivulets large enough to turn a mill. There are however, a number of lakes, plentifully &s;tored with various kinds of excellent fi&s;h. Their cattle are &s;mall and lean, owing perhaps to long confinement in winter, for during the &s;pace of eight months of the year they are kept almo&s;t continually within doors. A fourth part of the i&s;land, at lea&s;t, is a fore&s;t, in which there are a great variety of game, re&s;erved, by the royal man|date, for the amu&s;ement of the court. The i&s;land is divided into twenty-&s;ix di&s;tricts or bailiwicks; contain|ing thirteen towns, twelve ca&s;tles, and three hundred and forty-&s;even pari&s;hers.

In mo&s;t northern countries, both men and women are fond of &s;trong li|quors.

A &s;tranger no &s;ooner enters a hou&s;e, then the bottle is pre&s;ented. The proper hour of drinking is whenever the liquor is to be had; nor are they &s;o puny as to require a dilution of water to make it go down, but take it without the &s;malle&s;t mix|ture. The higher orders of females commonly leave the table after a gla&s;s or two goes round; but the men drink till they forget that they live in a cold climate, and are carried to bed in a &s;tate of complete &s;tupefac|tion.</P>

It is fortified by three whole and two half ba&s;tions, be&s;ides &s;trong out|works, and a regular citadel. On the Memmel &s;ide of the river, the land is fertile and productive, but on the &s;ide oppo&s;ite, it is only a barren &s;and, producing no|thing either for man or bea&s;t. The river is broad and navigable a con&s;iderable way above the town, but no &s;hips go further up, owing perhaps, to the want of trade in the inland parts of the kingdom: for commerce is al|mo&s;t &s;olely confined to the towns on the coa&s;t.</P>

<P>Our ve&s;&s;el being only fifty tons burthen, a captain, three men and a boy, were all that was nece&s;&s;ary to navigate her. We had a favourable breeze, which &s;oon carried us acro&s;s the channel to our intended port, and finding a ready market for our cargo, we loaded with grain, with an intention of di&s;po&s;ing of it in Liverpool. I had the opportunity, however, of &s;pending a few days in this ancient Iri&s;h city, and I mu&s;t here frankly ac|knowledge, that in all the different places I have been in, I never yet met with &s;o much real, unexpected and unmerited ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>The city of Drogheda is the principal town in the county of Luth, in the province of Ul&s;ter. It had for|merly been &s;urrounded by a wall, the greater part of which is now in ruins. It contains from &s;ix to &s;even thou&s;and inhabitants, and has an excellent harbour, from which va&s;t quantities of grain are exported. The greater part of the inhabitants are of the Roman Cath|olic per&s;ua&s;ion. The e&s;tabli&s;hed church is a large and elegant building. Formerly there was a Pre&s;byterian church here, but the clergyman getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the deed of the ground and hou&s;e, and finding he had but
<PB N="265" REF="035035_0258_0FFFF6CDA5EC5FC0">
few hearers, &s;old it to a company of players, who have hitherto u&s;ed it as a theatre.</P>
<P>This city &s;tands on both &s;ides of the river Boyne, but the greater part of it is on the north &s;ide. About a mile and a half above Drogheda, the famous battle of the Boyne was fought, where king James made the la&s;t &s;tand for three kingdoms, if a &s;tand it could be cal|led, for the man, who in a &s;ubordinate capacity was an undaunted commander, when his all was at &s;take, retired to the &s;ide of a hill, at a &s;afe di&s;tance from the &s;cene of action, where he had a view of the battle, and &s;tood till he beheld his army routed and put to &s;light; after which he, him&s;elf, fled with the precipita|tion of a coward, and made the be&s;t of his way to France, where he dragged out the remainder of an in|glorious life, a dependent upon the bounty of Lewis XIV.</P>
<P>In memory of this famous battle, or as it is &s;aid, in memory of duke Schomberg, who fell in cro&s;&s;ing the Boyne, a monument is erected clo&s;e by the river &s;ide, about twenty-two or twenty-four feet high, exactly op|po&s;ite to the &s;pot where king William's army cro&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Iri&s;h &s;eem to prize the Dutch deliverance at a very high rate, for in mo&s;t of the northern countries, and e&s;pecially in this neighbourhood, it is cu&s;tomary for a whole company of convivial friends to fall down up|on their knees and drink the glorious and immortal me|mory

of king William III. and till of late, that politics have taken a new direction, this, in almo&s;t every com|pany, was certain to be a toa&s;t.</P>
<P>I happened while in this place, one day to fall in company with a Roman Catholick clergyman, at a gen|tleman's hou&s;e. In the cour&s;e of the conver&s;ation, he entertained the company with the following profe&s;&s;ional anecdote, which amu&s;ed us not a little. "One night lately," &s;ays he, "I was &s;ent for, to ble&s;s a piece of mould to put into the coffin of an old woman, about half a mile out of town, who was to be buried next day. As I had half undre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf, and was almo&s;t ready to go bed, I told them to go and ble&s;s it them&s;elves, and as they had the orders of a clergyman it would do equally as well as if I was on the &s;pot. This did not by any means plea&s;e them, and before the me&s;&s;enger went home he got another clergy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n, who went and ble&s;&s;ed the mould, and anathematized me.</P>
<P>"Next morning they went and complained of me to the tutelar bi&s;hop, who immediately &s;ent for me, and reprimanded me &s;everely, telling me I ought to com|ply with popular prejudices, for the world was not yet ripe enough for the government of rea&s;on, and that it we did not keep mankind in awe by the&s;e little arts, we &s;hould &s;oon lo&s;e all power over them. I told him, (&s;ays the frair, for &s;uch he was) that power &s;o gained was better lo&s;t than kept, upon which we parted very
<PB N="267" REF="035035_0260_0FFFAF6BA9461DC8">
bad friends." I have &s;ince been informed that this &s;ame hone&s;t friar had, a few months after this, read his recan|tation in the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, and became an or|thodox preacher, according to the laws of the land.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, however, that the apo&s;tacy of a Roman Catholick prie&s;t has never yet had much effect in hurting the cau&s;e they de&s;erted, for the government of the country obliges the county in which they live, to pay every one of them forty pounds per annum, till they are provided with a living to that amount on the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment. When a prie&s;t apo&s;tatizes, therefore, they &s;el|dom place his defect to the account of con&s;cience. Our governor &s;ays, "They very well know the value of money, and if our religion was not the be&s;t in the coun|try, they would never give &s;o much <HI>to boot.</HI>" This bribe, indeed, is &s;eldom accepted by the clergy, and when any one does take it, he is heartily de&s;pi&s;ed by both parties. The legi&s;lative body, at the time this was made, might promi&s;e them&s;elves great effects, as it would be &s;uppo&s;ed that many of the clergy would be tempted by it, and many of their hearers would follow their exam|ple. But in my opinion, a &s;mall matter laid out in pa|rochial &s;chools, &s;uch as are e&s;tabli&s;hed in Scotland, would have had much better effect. By the&s;e all &s;ectaries would have been freed from that profound ignorance &s;o vi&s;ible among the lower ranks of &s;ociety; and whatever reli|gion their parents had trained them to, they would have, in time, been enabled to judge for them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="035035_0261_0FFFF6D6D7D45B68">After a&s;king my reader pardon for this long digre&s;|&s;ion, I return to my narrative. The loading of our ve&s;&s;el engaged us for three days, and on the twenty-fifth of December, we proceeded down the river, with a good north-we&s;terly breeze, and cro&s;&s;ing the channel, expected &s;oon to reach our port; but when we had got right a-brea&s;t of Holymouth, the wind &s;hifted &s;uddenly round to the ea&s;tward, and began to blow mo&s;t violent|ly; we &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ome of our &s;ails and rigging, and be|gan to fear our little ve&s;&s;el would be overpowered. We found there was no other chance for her than to keep before the wind; but perceiving we were getting fa&s;t to the we&s;tward, our captain thought proper to lay too: finding however, no probability of the wind abating, or our making a port, we were forced to drift before the wind for the &s;pace of eight days, during the greater part of which we &s;carcely knew where we were, nor had any of us a dry &s;hirt upon our back. In this &s;tate we continued, half frozen to death, and &s;carcely able to &s;tand upon our legs, till the fourth of January, when the wind veered round to the &s;outh, the &s;ea became &s;omewhat &s;moother, and the air milder; but our &s;ails were all tattered to pieces and &s;ome of them totally gone. What remained we patched up as well as we could, and at la&s;t reached the bay of Liverpool, more dead than alive. We entered it on the &s;ixth, but either through ignorance of the pilot, or the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of the man at the helm, we run upon the rocks, where we lay for &s;ome hours, and &s;u&s;tained con&s;iderable damage.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="035035_0262_0FFFF6DB820096A8">At la&s;t we got clear off, and proceeded to the dock, where we unloaded our cargo. The nece&s;&s;ary repairs detained us here for &s;ometime, after which we took in balla&s;t, but one gale coming after another, our captain judged it very un&s;afe to proceed to &s;ea with &s;o &s;mall a ve&s;&s;el; and the misfortunes that had already befallen us, made us all wi&s;h for more favourable appearances to &s;et out with.

<P>On the morning of the twelfth a young &s;ailor came on board, and be&s;poke a pa&s;&s;age to Scotland, which was readily agreed to.&mdash;He went on &s;hore to bring his clothes, but ju&s;t as he was about to come on board again he met with the captain of another Scotch ve&s;&s;el, who was in want of a hand, and offered him wages if he would go with him. The young man providentially a|greed with him, and by that means e&s;caped, in all pro|bability, the dreadful fate that befel my unhappy me&s;&s;|mates.</P>
<P>This day the wind became &s;omewhat more favoura|able, and the weather more inviting. We &s;et &s;ail, there|fore, and the captain took an affectionate farewell of a &s;on, the captain of another ve&s;&s;el, whom he left behind

him in Liverpool harbour, without &s;u&s;pecting it was to be the la&s;t parting.&mdash;With an ebbing tide and a fair wind we were &s;oon carried clear of all tho&s;e banks that render the navigation &s;o difficult and dangerous; when parting with our pilot, we directed our cour&s;e for the I&s;le of Man, but we had not long left the &s;hore, till a &s;trong gale began to blow, and the &s;ky overca&s;ting to|wards the clo&s;e of the day, threatened us with a dread|ful night; and alas! our fears had by no means magni|fied our dangers, for a mo&s;t dreadful night it certainly proved to us all.</P>
<P>We &s;tood on our cour&s;e as long as we could perceive which way it lay, but night brought along with it impe|netrable darkne&s;s; and now it was that we felt the hor|rors of our &s;ituation, for indeed a more dreadful &s;ituation can &s;carcely be conceived. The wind continued to blow with unu&s;ual violence, the &s;eas ran mountains high, we had no hopes of our ve&s;&s;el living long in &s;uch circum&s;tances, nor knew we the minute &s;he might be da&s;hed to pieces again&s;t a rock.</P>
<P>About eleven o'clock at night, the captain alarmed us with the di&s;mal tidings that the &s;hip was full of wa|ter. We flew to the pumps, but the balla&s;t had &s;hifted, and choked up the pumps &s;o, that all our endeavours that way was in vain, and we had by this time three feet water in the hold. We began to clear the hold with canns, and &s;uch other ve&s;&s;els as we had on board; but
<PB N="271" REF="035035_0264_0FFFAFA1E9E57E90">
alas! this was to little purpo&s;e, &s;till the water continued to gain upon us. Death now &s;eemed inevitable.

<P>A very thick &s;now was falling, we had not the &s;mal|le&s;t idea where we were, and to add to our horrors, one of the men gave the &s;hocking alarm, that we were get|ting fa&s;t upon &s;ome dreadful rocks.

Another of the hands &s;hared the &s;ame fate; three of us remained in the ve&s;&s;el, ca&s;ting about us a hopele&s;s eye for &s;ome means of pre&s;ervation. It im|mediately occurred to me to cut the la&s;hing of the long-boat, and try to heave her out; one of my &s;urviving companions ran to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, but all our efforts were vain, and we found the ve&s;&s;el mu&s;t immediately be da&s;hed to pieces. Another of my companions took to the ma&s;t, which, from the motion of the &s;hip lying up|on her broad &s;ide, was &s;ometimes in the water, and &s;ometimes out of it, and at the interval between the waves, I could perceive him making towards the end of it. The other, who was a boy, held fa&s;t by the rig|ging, and pierced the air with his cries. I kept by the ve&s;&s;el till I found her going to peices, and then fol|lowed my companion to the end of the ma&s;t, to which he was clinging clo&s;e. No other chance remained for me, but to endeavour to &s;ave my life by &s;wimming; and the tremendous appearance of the ocean made that a very hopele&s;s alternative. I called to my companion to follow me, and recommending my&s;elf to the mercy of the Almighty, plunged into the ocean.</P>
<P>I neither knew on what &s;hore we were ca&s;t, nor what di&s;tance we were from it. The ebb-tide at one time &s;weeping me at a greater di&s;tance from the land then when I fir&s;t &s;et out, for after &s;truggling about an hour

I found the wreck of the &s;hip between me and the &s;hore. My &s;trength by this time was nearly exhau&s;ted; I threw my&s;elf upon my back and tried to di&s;engage my|&s;elf from my clothes; this, however, I found I was una|ble to effect, and I mu&s;t inevitably have &s;unk to ri&s;e no more in a &s;hort time, if the returning tide had not a&s;|&s;i&s;ted me in making the &s;hore. This in a little time it did, without my being able to make any other exertion than barely to keep my&s;elf above the water. I reached a rock, but had &s;carcely &s;trength enough remaining to rai&s;e my&s;elf upon my feet, or get to the top of it.</P>
<P>When with much &s;truggling, I got my&s;elf &s;eated on it, I began to look about for my companions, hoping &s;ome of them had &s;aved them&s;elves by the &s;ame means. While I &s;at here, cold, wet, and trembling as I was, I found my&s;elf irre&s;i&s;tibly born down to &s;leep, and had nearly given way to my inclinations, when it occurred to me that I had not yet reached the &s;hore. I left the rock, and cro&s;&s;ing a &s;mall bay, found my&s;elf on a &s;andy beach. Here I threw my&s;elf down, not knowing what to do, or which way to turn my&s;elf. The morning was &s;till dark, and a deep &s;now had fallen upon the ground; I got up and tried to walk, but found I was unable to go any di&s;tance; I threw my&s;elf down again, and ca&s;t many a wi&s;tful look towards the &s;ea, for the arrival of &s;ome of my companions, but to no purpo&s;e. I found I mu&s;t attempt to find a hou&s;e, or my reaching the &s;hore would be of no con&s;equence, as I mu&s;t infallibly expire

upon the &s;pot. Once more I got up, and walked as I could, I knew nor whither. Providence at la&s;t directed me to a hou&s;e. I rapped, and called aloud for &s;ome time. I went round it, and exhau&s;ted my little remaining &s;trength, endeavouring to make the people hear, but could obtain no an&s;wer. I then endeavoured to find &s;ome place of &s;helter from the dreadful &s;torm, and at la&s;t found a little hovel with &s;ome &s;wine in it; and rough as my bed-fellows were, I found the heat they imparted extremely agreeable; I fell into a &s;tate of &s;lumbering, or rather &s;tupefaction; nor can I recollect from that moment any thing that befel me, till I found my&s;elf &s;tretched before a large fire, &s;eemingly made for my account, wrapped in blankets, and &s;urrounded by a number of peoples. It &s;eems I had neither opened my eyes nor uttered a word for &s;ome hours, and when I came to my &s;en&s;es, and began to thank God that I was in the land of the living, every one te&s;tified the utmo&s;t joy. They made the tendere&s;t enquiries how I found my&s;elf. I told them I would &s;oon be well, and thanked them in the be&s;t manner I could for their care and at|tention.</P>
<P>A worthy man, to whom I afterwards found the hou&s;e belonged, begged me not to di&s;tre&s;s my&s;elf with &s;peaking.

time they made me drink &s;ome warm milk and water; and now, for the fir&s;t time, I began to regain the com|mand of my &s;cattered &s;en&s;es. I recollected I had been ca&s;t away, but knew not, as yet, in what country I was. I conjectured it might be in the I&s;le of Man, but was anxious to &s;atisfy my&s;elf. Upon enquiry, they told me, I was in the north of Ireland, about &s;ix miles from Porto-Ferry, and three from Balywater. I then en|quired if they had heard any thing of my companions, but on that head received no &s;atisfaction. I had many que&s;tions to a&s;k, but my benevolent ho&s;t undertook to &s;atisfy me of every thing he knew concerning me, by the following acccount:</P>
<P>"About &s;even o'clock in the morning," &s;ays he, "the &s;torm was raging with the greate&s;t violence, and had torn the greater part of the thatch from the hou&s;e, &s;o that the &s;now was coming fa&s;t in upon the bed where we &s;lept.

Upon going nearer the yard, my wife thought &s;he heard the groans of a human being, we followed the &s;ound, and perceived you creeping in the ditch, gra&s;ping at thorns, and whatever was within your reach. La&s;t year a poor maniac in this country had frightened many of the neighbours; and my wife at fir&s;t &s;ight, imagined you to be him, and was for going off and leaving you. I was convinced, however, upon a nearer view, that you was &s;ome per&s;on in the utmo&s;t agony; and de&s;iring

her not to be afraid, we went up to you, and lifting you between us, the few cloaths you had upon you convinced of you was a &s;ailor. We carried you into the hou&s;e, but your &s;en&s;es were &s;o totally gone, that you frequent|ly attempted to bite us. After we had brought you in, we alarmed the neighbours, who gathered all about us, bewailing your fate, as they imagined you in the ago|nies of death: you could an&s;wer none of our que&s;tions, not even by &s;igns, and indeed &s;eemed totally in&s;en&s;ible to every thing that pa&s;&s;ed.

You became altogether motionle&s;s, and continued for &s;ome hours in &s;uch a &s;tate, that none of us could tell whether you was dead or alive. At la&s;t you made us all happy with the recovery of your &s;en&s;es, and you can remember what pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince.

<P>After thanking the good man again and again for his kindne&s;s, I told him as much as I knew of my mis|fortune; but when I came to mention my having gone into the hovel, they imagined I was &s;till deranged, as there was no &s;uch place as I de&s;cribed about the hou&s;e. While we were di&s;cour&s;ing the me&s;&s;enger returned,

bringing &s;ome whi&s;ky, a gla&s;s or two of which did me a mo&s;t material &s;ervice.</P>
<P>I was anxious beyond mea&s;ure to learn the fate of my companions, and in a &s;hort time &s;et out, accom|panied by my kind ho&s;t, and &s;ome of his neigh|bours, towards the &s;hore; but how greatly was I &s;urpri&s;ed to find that I was about a mile di&s;tant from it. After we had got more than half way, we came up to a hou&s;e, which I was per&s;uaded was the one I had fir&s;t come to, and there was a &s;wine hovel exactly like that into which I had fir&s;t entered. I endeavoured to per|&s;uade them that this was my late lodging, but it ap|peared unaccountable both to them and to my&s;elf, that I &s;hould have gone &s;o far afterwards, without any recollection of what had pa&s;&s;ed; I had &s;ome recollec|tion however, of having thrown off my jacket in the hovel, and begged them to go and look for it. They did &s;o, and found it, and this convinced them I was not mi&s;taken; but how my &s;teps had been directed to the ho&s;pitable man&s;ion of my pre&s;ent landlord, heaven on|ly knows. Upon going down to the beach, we found the wreck had come a&s;hore; and the people in the neighbourhood were all &s;crambling for what they could get to carry off.</P>
<P>The greater part of what was mo&s;t valuable was al|ready gone. I began to remon&s;trate with &s;ome who had got clothes and other things, begging them to lay

them down, but received no other an&s;wer than a volley of oaths, and was ordered to &s;tand off, or they would &s;end me to eternity.</P>
<P>After I &s;aw nothing could be done with them, and had made many fruitle&s;s enquiries about my companions, &s;ome of whom, I &s;till hoped, might have reached the &s;hore, I obtained twelve men to watch over the wreck, and inform me if any per&s;on attempted to meddle with it; then I returned to the hou&s;e of my landlord, and con&s;ulted with him what was be&s;t to be done.</P>
<P>James Baillie, for that was the name of the pre&s;erver of my life, was of a very different di&s;po&s;ition from the mo&s;t of his neighbours.

He per&s;uaded me to go before a magi&s;trate, and declare every circ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">um&s;tance upon oath, and take a prote&s;t. A magi&s;trate, one Mr. Savage, lived at the di&s;tance of five miles, and in pur&s;uance of the advice of my landlord, I immediately &s;et out for his hou&s;e; but had not walked two miles when I was met by Mr. Main, a coa&s;ting officer, who told me Mr. Savage, the ju&s;tice, was gone from home; but that, if I would re|turn with him, he would take a particular account of e|very thing, and I might lodge a prote&s;t in his hands. I agreed to his propo&s;al, and delivered him a prote&s;t of

all I knew. He promi&s;ed to meet me in the morning, and appoint proper per&s;ons to take care of the wreck, and make the mo&s;t of it for the owners. I returned immediately to the wreck, and found, notwith&s;tanding of the guard I had appointed, many things were mi&s;&s;ing which I had before ob&s;erved, but I could obtain no re|dre&s;s, nor even find out the per&s;ons that had taken them. I &s;pent the re&s;t of the day in the boat, grappling for the bodies of my unfortunate companions, without being a|ble to find any of them.</P>
<P>I met Mr. Main according to appointment, who came to the beach with &s;ome other gentlemen. It was thought proper to carry what portable things had been &s;aved, to my landlord's barn, which was accordingly done. By Mr. Main's orders, a &s;trict &s;earch was made for the goods that had been carried away, through all the hou&s;es in the neighbourhood, but to little purpo&s;e, as the depredators had taken care to conceal them ef|fectually. I was therefore, forced to &s;it down con|tented with what I had done, con&s;cious that I had o|mitted nothing in the compa&s;s of my power, to &s;ecure to the &s;urvivors the remainder of my worthy ma&s;ter's effects.</P>
<P>In the whole of the bu&s;ine&s;s, Mr. Main conducted him&s;elf with a degree of attention and humanity which de&s;erves the highe&s;t encomiums, and the warme&s;t grati|tude from all concerned. He &s;aw every thing di&s;po&s;ed

of, and wrote a letter to the collector of Irvine, at my reque&s;t, to give notice of the tragical event. We judg|ed it mo&s;t advi&s;able to adverti&s;e what goods were left, for &s;ale; and accordingly they were &s;old for what they would bring, which was a mere trifle.</P>
<P>For &s;ome days I found my&s;elf &s;o weak and &s;ickly as to prevent my undertaking a journey to Scotland; this however I did as &s;oon as I was able; leaving the mel|ancholy &s;hore where I had lo&s;t all companions, who&s;e lifele&s;s bodies had been diligently &s;earched for every day during my &s;tay.</P>
<P>My ho&s;pitable landlord had acquired the rights of a father over me, by giving me a &s;econd exi&s;tence. He &s;eemed &s;orry when I propo&s;ed leaving him, and did all in his power to detain me till my health &s;hould be con|firmed. On my part, I felt for him all the affections of a &s;on. He had endeared him&s;elf to my heart by ma|ny good offices, and our parting was tender on both &s;ides. I had &s;carcely a rag of clothes on my back; tho&s;e I had on when the &s;hip &s;truck upon the rocks, being all cut and tore to peices. But the ho&s;pitality of my Iri&s;h friends &s;upplied me. One brought me a &s;hirt, another a pair of &s;hoes, &amp;c. and the captain's great coat, which had been wa&s;hed on &s;hore, covered all defects. I therefore parted reluctantly from the good man and woman that &s;aved my life, and who ever &s;hall be re|membered by me with grateful affection, and &s;et out for

Donaghadee, a &s;ea-port not far di&s;tant, on the twenti|eth of January.</P>
<P>At this port, which is the neare&s;t to Scotland, packet-boats are employed by government for convey|ing the mails between the two kingdoms; and in the&s;e pa&s;&s;engers may be accommodated with every thing heart could de&s;ire. The fare in the packet-boats is according to the pur&s;es and inclinations of the pa&s;|&s;engers, and the accommodations are proportioned to the fare. They can &s;ail in almo&s;t any weather, &s;o that one can never be at a lo&s;s, for any length of time, for a pa&s;&s;age between the two &s;i&s;ter kingdoms.</P>
<P>On my going on board the packet-boat, I met five unlucky men, who had been as unfortunate as my&s;elf, their &s;hip having been ca&s;t away on the coa&s;t of Spain. The &s;imilarity of our &s;ituations created a mutual &s;ympa|thy, and we entertained one another, during the pa&s;&s;age, with a recital of our misfortunes. They had procured a pa&s;&s;age in a Briti&s;h &s;hip, and had the day before landed at Belfa&s;t. In the &s;pace of four hours we got to Port-Patrick, and as we were all to travel the &s;ame road, we agreed to keep one another company; &s;till however, I found my&s;elf &s;o weak that I was hardly able to keep up with them; my feet and legs had been cut and brui&s;ed &s;o much on the morning our unfortunate accident hap|pened, it was with the greate&s;t pain I could move a foot.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="035035_0275_0FFFAF97853943D8">With much difficulty I reached the place of my na|tivity, where I was joyfully received by my friends, who had ju&s;t got intelligence of our unlucky fate; Mr. Main's letter having come to hand only a few hours before I arrived. The widow of my decea&s;ed friend, the captain, I found in a &s;tate little &s;hort of di&s;traction: and indeed it was no great wonder, &s;he had lo&s;t one of the be&s;t of hu&s;bands, and a &s;troke &s;o unexpected mu&s;t have been &s;everely felt.</P>
<P>He was at the time of his death upwards of fifty, and through life had retained the mo&s;t amiable char|acter. Providence had ble&s;t his endeavours, and ena|bled him to leave his family in good circum&s;tances; notwith&s;tanding they &s;u&s;tained con&s;iderable lo&s;s from this melancholy accident, for the ve&s;&s;el was &s;olely his own property. The other &s;ufferers on this occa&s;ion, though unmarried, left behind them parents, who had been mo&s;tly &s;upported by their indu&s;try; and what is remarkable, they were all widowed mothers. I found my&s;elf very unea&s;y in my native place for a long time after my return; the fight of me always producing a &s;hower of tears from the eyes of tho&s;e unfortunate &s;ur|vivors.</P>
<P>Thus have I given my reader a faithful account of my nautical life and tran&s;actions; and &s;hall be happy if any part of this work affords him a little entertain|ment, when his mind is relaxed from more importan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

employments. I can with confidence a&s;&s;ure him, that in the foregoing pages, I have adhered rigidly to truth; and as there are &s;everal living witne&s;&s;es of many of the tran&s;actions herein recorded, to them I can appeal for a confirmation of what I write.</P>
<P>As I am not to be deterred by the misfortunes of my pa&s;t life from pro&s;ecuting my favourite employment, but mean immediately to vi&s;it &s;ome other part of the globe. I beg leave for the pre&s;ent to bid my reader a|dieu: if my after life &s;hould be productive of any thing de&s;erving his notice, we may perhaps renew our acquaintance upon &s;ome future occa&s;ion.</P>
