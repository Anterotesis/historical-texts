</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_AS the Apo&s;tles of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, and many other primi|tive mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, were &s;ent forth with an exten|&s;ive commi&s;&s;ion, to teach all nations, and gather them into the Chri&s;tian church, &s;o they were endowed with power from on high, &s;uited to the de&s;ign of their
<PB N="4" REF="010873_0003_0F851BA712AD20C0">
mi&s;&s;ion. They were not only &s;anctified to an eminent degree by the &s;pecial grace of GOD; but al&s;o furni&s;hed with various extraordinary, and miraculous powers: among the&s;e was the gift of Tongues; which was an ability to &s;peak with ea&s;e, and propriety various languages, which they had not learned in the ordinary way of gaining the knowledge of them. Hereby two impor|tant ends were an&s;wered; one was this, that hereby they were enabled to teach and in&s;truct the different nations, to which they were &s;ent, by &s;peaking to them intelligibly in their own native tongue&mdash;the other; that &s;uch an incon|te&s;table miracle afforded &s;trong proof of their ex|traordinary mi&s;&s;ion, &s;o that they might be ju&s;tly regarded, as true me&s;&s;engers of the LORD OF HOSTS.</P>
<P>This gift of tongues appears to have been an abiding, permanent endowment, when once be|&s;towed: otherwi&s;e 'tis inconceivable how they could have been able to abu&s;e it, as many in the <HI>Corinthian</HI> church evidently did. They were unduly elated with this, and other miraculous gifts, and thence di&s;po&s;ed to make a vain o&s;ten|tation of it, by exerci&s;ing it needle&s;sly in their wor&s;hiping a&s;&s;emblies, where there was no oc|ca&s;ion for working a miracle, by &s;peaking in an unknown tongue, whereby the hearers received no in&s;truction or edification.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="010873_0004_0F851BA7E32FDFA0">For this the apo&s;tle very ju&s;tly reproves them in this chapter, &s;hewing them the unprofitable|ne&s;s, the great impropriety, and even ab&s;urdity of &s;uch a practice; ob&s;erving to them, that the gift of tongues was intended to be a &s;ign to them that believe not, as other miracles were: and not to be u&s;ed with tho&s;e, who had already believed, and profe&s;&s;ed the Chri&s;tian Faith, and only need|ed farther in&s;truction in the truths of the Go&s;|pel, which they had embraced upon &s;ufficient evidence.</P>
<P>He leads them to con&s;ider, that while any of them &s;pake in the church, in a language not un|der&s;tood by the a&s;&s;embly, either in praying, &s;ing|ing or preaching, it was impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould profit, or edify their hearers, who could not, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, bear any part in the wor&s;hip, or &s;ay, Amen to their prayers, or thank&s;|giving, however ju&s;t and pertinent they might otherwi&s;e be. Indeed the ca&s;e was very plain. The apo&s;tle therefore declares to them, that al|tho' he had rea&s;on to acknowledge with grati|tude to GOD, the gift of tongues, and his ability to &s;peak divers languages, more than all of them, an&s;werable to his exten&s;ive commi&s;&s;ion, as the apo&s;tle of the Gentiles, yet he was far from an inclination to &s;pend his time in a wor&s;hiping a&s;|&s;embly of profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians, in di&s;playing the&s;e his gifts, without any advantage to the hear|ers;
<PB N="6" REF="010873_0005_0F851BA827A202E8">
and affirms, under in&s;piration, that <HI>in the church he had rather &s;peak five words with his under&s;tanding,</HI> that is, intelligibly, or in a known tongue, <HI>than ten thou&s;and words</HI> of gibberi&s;h, <HI>in an unknown</HI> language.</P>
<P>It is plain from the text, as well as &s;everal o|ther pa&s;&s;ages in this chapter, that &s;peaking with the under&s;tanding intends &s;peaking intelligibly, or &s;o as to be under&s;tood by the hearers, in di|rect oppo&s;ition to &s;peaking in <HI>an unknown tongue.</HI> This is very evident from the rea&s;on here a&s;&s;ign|ed by the apo&s;tle, viz. <HI>that by his voice he might teach others al&s;o,</HI> which he could not do by ut|tering ever &s;o many pompous, unintelligible &s;ounds. The text clearly teaches us this
<Q><HI>DOCTRINE,</HI> That it is a matter of great im|portance, that all teaching or &s;peaking in the chri&s;tian church, &s;hould be in the mo&s;t plain intelligible manner, and not in an unknown tongue.</Q></P>
<P>This is very forcibly expre&s;&s;ed by the apo&s;tle's compari&s;on of five intelligible words, with ten thou&s;and unmeaning &s;ounds, or words of doubtful &s;ignification, and his giving the preference to the former. So that taking the expre&s;&s;ion in literal ex|actne&s;s, it is above two thou&s;and times better to &s;peak intelligibly, than in an unknown tongue.</P>
<P>We may briefly con&s;ider what is required in &s;peaking with the under&s;tanding, or intelligibly:&mdash;
<PB N="7" REF="010873_0006_0F851BA8E47F8180">
and offer a few con&s;iderations to &s;hew the im|portance of it in the church.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>We may briefly con&s;ider, what is required in &s;peaking with the under&s;tanding, or intelligibly.</HI></P>
<P>Now as this is directly oppo&s;ed to &s;peaking in an unknown tongue; and as per&s;ons may u&s;e a language unknown either to them&s;elves, or their hearers, or to both, in order to avoid each of the&s;e, it is nece&s;&s;ary,</P>
<P N="1">1. That tho&s;e who &s;peak in the church &s;hould them&s;elves have as clear ideas, as may be, af|fixed to the words they u&s;e. I &s;ay, as clear ide|as as may be, becau&s;e there are &s;ome &s;ublime My&s;teries a&s;&s;erted in the &s;acred Oracles, of which we can have but very imperfect and inadequate conceptions in the pre&s;ent &s;tate&mdash;Such are the doctrines of the Trinity, the Union of the hu|man and Divine Nature in the Per&s;on of the one MEDIATOR. Here we may have clear ideas of the truths a&s;&s;erted; altho' when we would at|tempt to illu&s;trate the manner, in which the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions are true, our conceptions mu&s;t be very imperfect, by rea&s;on of the incomprehen&s;iblene&s;s of the &s;ubject, or our not having any thing in the &s;en&s;ible world, that bears any near re&s;emblance to it. But where the nature of &s;ubjects is &s;uch, as bears any con&s;iderable proportion to the mea&s;ure of our &s;canty intellectual capacities, we &s;hould be care|ful to get the cleare&s;t ideas of them, when we
<PB N="8" REF="010873_0007_0F851BA9C7AAFB70">
attempt to &s;peak about them; and not deal out meer empty, unmeaning &s;ounds, without knowing what we intend. When per&s;ons in &s;peaking thus, u&s;e words without any clear ideas affixed to them, they are chargeable with u&s;ing an unknown tongue in a double &s;en&s;e: for if they know not what they mean them&s;elves, 'tis certain their hearers cannot under&s;tand what their meaning is. This great abu&s;e of language is extremely common among the le&s;s thinking part of mankind, e&s;pecially when they conver&s;e about things of a religious or moral nature. How common is it to hear them prattle out the words they have learnt, as Parrots do, without any clear, fixed meaning to them in their own minds? So that a more difficult que&s;tion can't be put to them, than to a&s;k them, what they mean. And it would be well, if there were le&s;s of this to be found in the di&s;cour&s;es of tho&s;e, who are under advantages for knowledge and learning, and make preten&s;ions to it.</P>
<P>This great mi&s;chief in the u&s;e of language, ari&s;es very much from learning fir&s;t the words u&s;ed to convey the more complex ideas of moral and religious &s;ubjects, and re&s;ting in the bare words, without taking due care and pains to get clear and determinate ideas annexed to them in their minds.</P>
<P>This is to be carefully avoided by all tho&s;e who &s;peak in the chri&s;tian church.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="9" REF="010873_0008_0F851BAA6E74DE38">2. They &s;hould &s;peak with <HI>propriety,</HI> or u&s;e words in the plain, generally received &s;en&s;e, which e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom hath affixed to them.</P>
<P>Altho' words are mere arbitrary &s;igns of our ideas, yet cu&s;tom fixes and determines their mean|ing. And he that would talk to others in a known tongue, mu&s;t u&s;e them in the &s;en&s;e, in which they are generally u&s;ed and under&s;tood in that language; otherwi&s;e he is guilty of the gro&s;s impropriety of calling darkne&s;s light, and light darkne&s;s. He may not affix to them a new and different &s;en&s;e, and u&s;e them to &s;ignify this new meaning, unle&s;s he gives &s;uitable notice of it, by defining the meaning of the terms he u&s;es. This is &s;o plainly requi&s;ite to &s;peaking intelligibly, that 'tis needle&s;s to enlarge upon it.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is nece&s;&s;ary, that tho&s;e who &s;peak in the chri&s;tian church, &s;hould adapt their language and di&s;cour&s;es to the under&s;tanding and capacity of their hearers in general.</P>
<P>There will indeed be &s;ome in every chri&s;tian a&s;&s;embly of &s;o low attainments in knowledge, as not to under&s;tand even plain di&s;cour&s;es. The&s;e are to be taught and in&s;tructed more privately; as it is highly improper that the public teaching &s;hould be brought down &s;o low, as to be adapt|ed, and as it were confined to a few &s;uch, to the neglect and injury of a much greater number. The ob&s;ervation only intends, that all public
<PB N="10" REF="010873_0009_0F851BABAB0BA358">
teaching or in&s;truction in the church &s;hould be &s;uited to the under&s;tanding and conception of the <HI>generality</HI> of the hearers, which may be done in our a&s;&s;emblies, without de&s;cending to a very low, groveling or puerile manner of diction. This great ma&s;ter of language, the apo&s;tle Paul, who al&s;o had the gift of divers tongues, commends him&s;elf to the Corinthians, as having u&s;ed great <HI>plainne&s;s of &s;peech</HI> with them in his in&s;tructions, 2 Cor. iii. 12. This is highly nece&s;&s;ary in all teaching, as it is the fir&s;t and principal de&s;ign of all &s;peaking, to communicate our ideas clearly to tho&s;e with whom we conver&s;e. If therefore any per&s;ons in public teaching indulge them&s;elves in the u&s;e of &s;uch a &s;ublime &s;tile, abounding with lengthy intricate periods, or frequently introduce abundance of &s;uch hard words or lofty expre&s;&s;i|ons, as are unintelligible to their hearers, they are guilty of a very unpardonable fault, and mi&s;s the great end of edifying their hearers. For &s;o far as the language u&s;ed is unintelligible to them, it is an unknown tongue; and then it matters not, as to the important purpo&s;e of their in&s;truc|tion, whether it be Engli&s;h, or Hebrew. If any public teachers practi&s;e thus under the notion of excellency of language, or goodne&s;s and elegance of &s;tile, they greatly mi&s;s-judge as to the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential quality of a good &s;tile, which is <HI>intelli|giblene&s;s,</HI> or <HI>per&s;pecuity.</HI> And if there be any,
<PB N="11" REF="010873_0010_0F851BAC2693EE48">
who affect the u&s;e of &s;uch hard words, and &s;cho|la&s;tic phra&s;es with a view to gain the reputation of <HI>profound learning,</HI> among the common people, they are herein <HI>profoundly &s;illy,</HI> and ridiculou&s;ly vain. Such language thus u&s;ed ju&s;tly de&s;erves the title of <HI>high &s;welling words of vanity.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. That they avoid, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the u&s;e of ambiguous words, or tho&s;e of a double and doubtful meaning. There is a va&s;t number of words in every copious language, to which men have annexed more meanings than one; and &s;o they are u&s;ed, and may be under&s;tood, in dif|ferent &s;en&s;es. And hence a per&s;on's u&s;ing &s;uch words doth not clearly determine, or &s;atisfy the hearers, what the &s;peaker means by them, be|cau&s;e they are of doubtful &s;ignification. They are, as the apo&s;tle ob&s;erves in the context, like a trumpet that gives an uncertain &s;ound, and &s;o doth not certify the army, whether they are cal|led to prepare for battle, or to retreat from the enemy. They are words not ea&s;y to be under|&s;tood&mdash;they dont give &s;uch a di&s;tinction in the &s;ound, i. e. do not convey &s;uch a certain deter|minate meaning, as that it can be known, what is &s;poken, or intended by the &s;peaker. This is a defect, and imperfection nece&s;&s;arily attending human language in &s;ome mea&s;ure; and there|fore ought not to be increa&s;ed and promoted; but to be avoided and remedied, as much as po&s;|&s;ible.
<PB N="12" REF="010873_0011_0F851BAD6BED7BC0">
This is ju&s;tly complained of, as a fruit|ful &s;ource of much confu&s;ion in di&s;cour&s;es, of great mi&s;under&s;tandings and di&s;putes in the world. And to affect this ambiguity of expre&s;|&s;ion in &s;peaking, is to affect one of the greate&s;t im|perfections of language. This mu&s;t be utterly unbecoming the character of a philo&s;opher, and much more beneath the character of a go&s;pel mini&s;ter, a me&s;&s;enger of the Lord of Ho&s;ts. And therefore tho&s;e who would &s;peak in the church with the under&s;tanding, &s;hould carefully avoid it, as much as they can, and never u&s;e any expre&s;&s;ions of a doubtful meaning in matters of religion, while they can find others more free from ambiguity, and which will more preci&s;ely and determinately convey the &s;entiments of their minds, and make known to their hearers the me&s;|&s;ages they bring from GOD. And the de&s;igned u&s;e of &s;uch ambiguous expre&s;&s;ions, when &s;peak|ing in the church, either in praying, preaching, or any other way of declaring to the church our &s;entiments upon religious &s;ubjects, is evident|ly affecting to &s;peak in an unknown tongue, which is &s;o plainly condemned by the Holy Gho&s;t in the text. It would be very &s;hocking indeed, to &s;uppo&s;e that any mini&s;ter, &s;peaking in the name of GOD, u&s;es &s;uch doubtful ambiguous language, on de&s;ign to conceal what he really takes to be the truth of GOD, revealed in his
<PB N="13" REF="010873_0012_0F851BAE2572BF08">
word. To &s;uppo&s;e this, without &s;trong evidence, would be gro&s;&s;ly uncharitable; while it is the pro|fe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of the go&s;pel mini&s;try clearly to lay open, and explain the great truths of the go&s;pel, and declare the whole coun&s;el of GOD.</P>
<P>But if this be a defect &s;o nece&s;&s;arily attending all languages, how can it be avoided in &s;peaking? I an&s;wer,</P>
<P N="5">5. By u&s;ing great care in defining and explain|ing our words, where there is any danger of a mi&s;under&s;tanding. For altho' this may not al|ways ab&s;olutely an&s;wer the de&s;ired end, yet it is the mo&s;t natural, and indeed the only po&s;&s;ible re|medy for this imperfection of language, as is ve|ry judiciou&s;ly pointed out by Mr. Locke, and many others upon this &s;ubject. And if proper care be taken in this matter, we may con&s;iderably remedy this defect of language, convey our ideas with clearne&s;s, avoid the inconveniency, and ab|&s;urdity of &s;peaking in an unknown tongue. Nor will it be ordinarily nece&s;&s;ary to &s;pend much time in defining our words: it may therefore be ea&s;ily done, and ought always to be carefully practi&s;ed, when we apprehend there is any danger of being mi&s;under&s;tood; or whenever they that hear us de&s;ire an explanation of the words we u&s;e. This is the great end, and advantage of all expo&s;itions on the &s;criptures by preaching or printing. The only pertinent de&s;ign of all this mu&s;t be to point out and explain the true &s;en&s;e and meaning of
<PB N="14" REF="010873_0013_0F851BB295116AD8">
&s;cripture-expre&s;&s;ions, which meaning is the Scrip|ture it&s;elf, the object of faith, the word and truth of GOD, which liveth and abideth forever. This hath al&s;o been ever regarded, and aimed at, as one great end of tho&s;e human compo&s;ures, called Confe&s;&s;ions of Faith. They are only an open, plain, hone&s;t definition of what a church or per|&s;on means by &s;cripture-expre&s;&s;ions; and their a&s;|&s;ent to them is only a declaration of their belief of the word of GOD, i. e. of the truths or pro|po&s;itions revealed in the word of GOD. And all this with a de&s;ign to avoid the irrational practice of &s;peaking in the church in an unknown tongue. For in however plain and determinate language the holy Scriptures were fir&s;t delivered, it is un|deniably evident in fact they are got to be am|biguous, and of doubtful meaning in the mouths of profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians: &s;o that by the &s;ame &s;cripture-expre&s;&s;ion one will under&s;tand and mean one thing, and another will mean quite a diffe|rent thing. This is not owing to any defect of the &s;acred Scriptures, properly &s;peaking: but partly to the unavoidable imperfection of human language, which is the channel, wherein divine truths are conveyed to us, and more e&s;pecially to the perver&s;ene&s;s of men, who have been labour|ing from age to age to wre&s;t them from their true genuine meaning, as they were fir&s;t given by In&s;piration of GOD. The expre&s;&s;ions of Scrip|ture
<PB N="15" REF="010873_0014_0F851BB2ABDC8400">
having been mon&s;trou&s;ly tortured and wre&s;t|ed by various &s;ects of nominal chri&s;tians for &s;e|venteen hundred years, it is not in the lea&s;t &s;trange, that they are become ambiguous, by rea|&s;on of the various different, and contrary &s;en&s;es affixed to them by the many different &s;ects in the chri&s;tian world. Notwith&s;tanding this, the Scriptures indeed in <HI>the mouth of God,</HI> and as they are <HI>his</HI> language to us, are &s;ufficiently clear, plain and determinate in their meaning; &s;o that by comparing &s;cripture with &s;cripture, the true &s;en&s;e thereof may be di&s;covered and determined in all important points by them that are hone&s;tly de|&s;irous to know the truth, as it is in JESUS. So that this ambiguity of &s;cripture-expre&s;&s;ions doth not properly belong to the &s;criptures, con&s;idered as the <HI>word of God</HI> to us; but as the&s;e &s;ame ex|pre&s;&s;ions are u&s;ed by <HI>men</HI> of contrary &s;entiments, they are evidently become of uncertain, doubt|ful meaning in <HI>their</HI> mouths. And that this is true in fact, is demon&s;trably evident from hence, that both Prote&s;tants and Papi&s;ts will readily give their a&s;&s;ent fully and plumply to the &s;acred &s;crip|tures, while they differ as widely in their real be|lief concerning the true &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture, even in very e&s;&s;ential points, as Heaven from Hell, or Light from Darkne&s;s. In what intelligible &s;en&s;e can it be &s;aid, that both the&s;e believe the &s;crip|tures, i. e. the truths which GOD hath revealed,
<PB N="16" REF="010873_0015_0F851BB3691CB820">
concerning tho&s;e important points, wherein they &s;o widely differ? The utmo&s;t that can be ratio|nally under&s;tood, from their declaring their be|lief of the holy &s;criptures to be the word of GOD, is &s;imply this, that they believe there is &s;ome &s;en&s;e or other, which may be put upon the&s;e &s;cripture-expre&s;&s;ions, which &s;en&s;e they believe to be true, and de&s;ignedly revealed from GOD. What hath been here ob&s;erved concerning Pa|pi&s;ts and Prote&s;tants, is well known to be true with regard to all the different &s;ects of chri&s;tians in the known world, however mon&s;trou&s;ly erro|neous, or diametrically contrary to each other, their religious &s;entiments may be.</P>
<P>I mention the&s;e things to &s;hew, that the expre&s;|&s;ions of &s;cripture, both in the original languages, altho' they are <HI>words taught by the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> and al&s;o in our tran&s;lation of the Bible, however judiciou&s;ly cho&s;en by the tran&s;lators, are in fact come to be of a doubtful, uncertain meaning, <HI>in the mouths of men,</HI> and are therefore in a great mea&s;ure an unknown tongue; or, to u&s;e the apo&s;|tle's &s;imile, are like a <HI>trumpet that gives an uncer|tain &s;ound.</HI> And certainly tho&s;e mu&s;t be endow|ed with a very extraordinary di&s;cernment, who can be fully &s;atisfied of the &s;oundne&s;s of a per|&s;on's Faith, by a declaration of his belief of the holy &s;criptures; or under&s;tand with clearne&s;s what a per&s;on means, when he &s;peaks in an un|known

<P>After what hath been here &s;aid, it may &s;eem the le&s;s &s;trange, that &s;uch an ambiguity, or un|certainty of meaning &s;hould have happened to the &s;acred &s;criptures, <HI>as they are u&s;ed by men,</HI> when we con&s;ider a very notorious fact of a &s;imilar na|ture, re&s;pecting the doctrinal articles of the church of England, which are very intelligibly expre&s;&s;ed, and have been compiled but a few years, comparatively &s;peaking; and yet they are become &s;o very ambiguous, and of &s;uch uncer|tain meaning, by the dexterity and &s;ubtlety of learned expo&s;itors, that they are now under&s;tood by thou&s;ands to mean almo&s;t any thing, or no|thing, and are readily a&s;&s;ented to, and &s;ub&s;cribed by huge multitudes of the Epi&s;copal Clergy, who no more believe them in the true, natural, genu|ine &s;en&s;e of the Compilers of them, than they believe the doctrine of Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, or the Infalibility of his burle&s;que Holine&s;s, the Bi&s;hop of Rome.

order to avoid the ab&s;urd conduct of &s;peaking in an unknown tongue.</P>
<P>To make this further evident, I proceed,</P>
<P N="2">II. To offer a few con&s;iderations, &s;hewing the importance of &s;peaking intelligibly in the chri&s;ti|an church, in oppo&s;ition to the u&s;ing of an un|known tongue.</P>
<P>It is the plain de&s;ign and &s;pirit of the text, to|gether with the context, to a&s;&s;ert and illu&s;trate the preferablene&s;s, and &s;o the importance of this Matter. The in&s;pired apo&s;tle was directed to write particularly to the <HI>Corinthian</HI> church upon this &s;ubject, and to reprove the public teachers therein for &s;o gro&s;s an error, as that of &s;peaking unintelligibly in the church, although they here|in made u&s;e of a language miraculou&s;ly given them of GOD, which might &s;eem to furni&s;h them with &s;ome plau&s;ible excu&s;e for the u&s;ing of it in the church. And yet the practice was utterly to be condemned: the Apo&s;tle in&s;i&s;ted upon plainne&s;s and intelligiblene&s;s of &s;peech; that they &s;hould utter words <HI>ea&s;y to be under&s;tood</HI>; and not of a doubtful, ambiguous meaning, like the trum|pet that gives an uncertain &s;ound. The expre&s;|&s;ion in the text to this purpo&s;e, is very forcible: as if the apo&s;tle had &s;aid, You had almo&s;t as good be &s;ilent in the church, as to &s;peak in this un|profitable, trifling manner. The fewe&s;t intelli|gible words, that can form a propo&s;ition, upon
<PB N="19" REF="010873_0018_0F851BB5B44FD498">
any important &s;ubject of religion, are more ad|vantageous, and convey more in&s;truction to the church, than ten thou&s;and words of an unknown, or uncertain meaning. I will briefly ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. The importance of it appears from hence, that the great end and de&s;ign of all &s;peaking, is the communicating of our ideas, or the convey|ing of truth to others. When this end is not an&s;wered, or properly aimed at, &s;peaking is vain; and this noble gift of language, whereby GOD hath &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed, and rai&s;ed the hu|man race above the brutal creation, is ungrateful|ly perverted and abu&s;ed, and pro&s;tituted to a ve|ry low and trifling purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is the only way, in which there can be any &s;uch thing, as teaching or in&s;truction in the chri&s;tian church.</P>
<P>The great de&s;ign of the go&s;pel mini&s;try, and of all &s;peaking in the church, is the edification of the body. <HI>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations.</HI> But what teaching or edification can there be, with|out the conveyance of knowledge or truth to the mind? Or how can the&s;e be conveyed by meer unmeaning, unintelligible, or uncertain &s;ounds? Some indeed may be &s;o weak, as to feel very de|voutly affected, and perhaps imagine them&s;elves extremely edified, only by the &s;ound of words, without any ideas or meaning to them; or only by a peculiarly modulated, &s;anctimonious tone of
<PB N="20" REF="010873_0019_0F851BB684CDEB60">
the voice. And there is ju&s;t rea&s;on to fear, that a great deal of tho&s;e high religious affections, vi&s;ible in &s;ome wor&s;hiping a&s;&s;emblies, hath its ri&s;e from no better cau&s;e, than meer &s;ound and noi&s;e, with|out the clear perception of any important, affect|ing truths pre&s;ented to the view of the mind. But all &s;uch devotion, or &s;uppo&s;ed edification is ju&s;t as worthle&s;s, and as far from any thing truly &s;pi|ritual, as tho&s;e emotions of animal nature which are rai&s;ed by the bla&s;t of a trumpet, the thunder of a drum, or the &s;ound of a violin. And the ir|rational practice of &s;peaking in the church, in an unknown tongue, or the dealing in &s;ounds, to the neglect of &s;en&s;e, without any clear, determinate meaning, hath a powerful tendency to promote this kind of animal devotion, in which there is no religion at all. The apo&s;tle de&s;pi&s;es, and con|demns all &s;uch &s;peaking, as being de&s;titute of any real in&s;truction. He cho&s;e on the contrary, to &s;peak with the under&s;tanding, for this important purpo&s;e, <HI>that by his voice he might teach others</HI>; not divert or amu&s;e them with empty noi&s;e. The &s;incere milk of the word, i. e. pure go&s;pel truths, is the only food or nouri&s;hment, whereby Chri&s;|tians can grow in grace, be truly edified, and make advances in a life of faith and holine&s;s. And if any per&s;ons can be &s;atisfied with meer uncertain &s;ounds, 'tis evident they feed upon the wind, al|mo&s;t in a literal &s;en&s;e; and &s;urely no &s;olid growth
<PB N="21" REF="010873_0020_0F851BB72D613FA0">
can be expected from &s;uch &s;lender airy aliment.</P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;peaking in an unknown tongue, or in ambiguous, doubtful terms, is a gro&s;s affront to common &s;en&s;e, and a manife&s;t impo&s;ition upon tho&s;e whom we pretend to teach.</P>
<P>It would certainly be taken &s;o in the common, and civil affairs of life, to have an an&s;wer return|ed to a proper, pertinent que&s;tion, in an unknown language, or in words of &s;uch uncertain &s;ignifica|tion, as leave ju&s;t room to doubt the true mean|ing of him that an&s;wers. If a per&s;on, pretend|ing to give a &s;erious an&s;wer to a plain que&s;tion, does it in &s;uch a manner, as doth not amount to a real an&s;wer, or a plain declaration of his mean|ing, we are obliged to look upon it as a meer eva|&s;ion, and impo&s;ition: and if he refu&s;es to explain his meaning clearly, 'tis ju&s;t the &s;ame as refu&s;ing to give an an&s;wer. And if this would be ju&s;tly re&s;ented in the common affairs of life, it &s;urely ought to be greatly di&s;liked, and avoided in the more weighty concerns of religion.</P>
<P N="4">4. Speaking intelligibly in the church, is plainly required by that great principle of chri&s;tian mora|lity, the doing to others, as we would have them do to us.</P>
<P>When we are &s;poken to, or addre&s;&s;ed by others, e&s;pecially in matters of any con&s;iderable impor|tance, we always choo&s;e to have it done in &s;uch a manner, as that we may clearly under&s;tand
<PB N="22" REF="010873_0021_0F851BB809773BA8">
what they intend. And if, while they make a &s;hew of informing us by &s;peaking, they di&s;cover a de&s;ign to conceal their true meaning from us, we directly judge, they really abu&s;e and mock us. And therefore, as we &s;hould ju&s;tly look upon this abu&s;ive in others, we ought to avoid it in our dealings with them, and endeavour to let them know our meaning clearly and plainly, when we make a preten&s;ion to it. Hence,</P>
<P N="5">5. This is ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite to the character of <HI>Integrity and Uprightne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Without uprightne&s;s and godly &s;incerity there can be no true religion. Without this moral ho|ne&s;ty, and integrity of heart, all preten&s;ions to it are vain. <HI>Lord, who &s;hall abide in thy tabernacle, who &s;hall abide in thy holy hill? He that walketh up|rightly, and worketh righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;peaketh the truth in his heart.</HI> P&s;al. xv. 1.2. Whenever there|fore in preaching, or in any other method of &s;peaking in the church, we make a profe&s;&s;ion of declaring the truth, or delivering our &s;entiments upon the great &s;ubjects of religion, if we de&s;ign|edly endeavour to conceal our real &s;entiments, or what we take to be the truth, by &s;peaking in an unknown tongue, or by u&s;ing doubtful ambigu|ous expre&s;&s;ions on de&s;ign, we mu&s;t be guilty of gro&s;s di&s;hone&s;ty; we do not uprightly &s;peak the truth in our hearts, i. e. the true meaning and re|al &s;entiments of our hearts. Such a conduct can|not
<PB N="23" REF="010873_0022_0F851BB9B0928260">
be reconciled with moral hone&s;ty; 'tis plain, wilful deception; and would be ju&s;tly &s;tigmatized with the name of <HI>knavery,</HI> in bargains, civil con|tracts, or commerce. And why it &s;hould be any better in matters of religion, when we are pro|fe&s;&s;edly declaring the truth, as witne&s;&s;es for GOD, is very hard to conceive.</P>
<P N="6">6. Speaking in the church unintelligibly, or in an unknown tongue, is acting the part of a child, of a Barbarian, and even of a madman.</P>
<P>Children are very apt to u&s;e words without ide|as, to be plea&s;ed with their own unintelligible prattle. And &s;uch the Apo&s;tle plainly intimates this conduct of the Corinthian teachers to be, in the ver&s;e following the text: <HI>Brethren, be not children in under&s;tanding; howbeit, in malice be ye children; but in under&s;tanding be men.</HI> And in ver. 11, the Apo&s;tle plainly declares it to be act|ing the part of a barbarian; <HI>Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice,</HI>&mdash;he that &s;peaketh <HI>&s;hall be a barbarian unto me</HI>; i. e. it will be much the &s;ame, as if he &s;hould talk <HI>Indian</HI> to an Eng|li&s;h auditory. There needs nothing &s;aid to di&s;|play the ridiculous ab&s;urdity of &s;uch a piece of conduct. Nay the Apo&s;tle proceeds farther, and repre&s;ents it as acting the <HI>madman,</HI> ver. 23. <HI>If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all &s;peak with tongues, and there come in tho&s;e that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they
<PB N="24" REF="010873_0023_0F851BBA2ACBAC58">
not &s;ay that ye are mad?</HI> that is, will they not have <HI>ju&s;t rea&s;on</HI> to look upon you in that light, and to &s;ay you act like <HI>madmen?</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Speaking intelligibly in the chri&s;tian church is of great importance, as it tends to promote bro|therly Love and Union, and pre&s;erve the Liberty of the churches of CHRIST.</P>
<P>The time will not allow me to dwell upon the great importance, and excellency of brotherly love, or di&s;play, <HI>how good, and how plea&s;ant a thing it is for brethren to dwell together in Unity:</HI> nei|ther need I do it; they are by the con&s;ent of all confe&s;&s;edly &s;o excellent and de&s;irable, and the want of them &s;o uncomfortable and de&s;tructive to religion and the wellfare of the church of CHRIST. Now the Practice of &s;peaking very in|telligibly and unre&s;ervedly upon religious &s;ubjects hath the greate&s;t tendency to promote this bro|therly love among Chri&s;tians: Whereas &s;u&s;picions, jealou&s;ies, and mi&s;under&s;tandings are frequently occa&s;ioned, and abundantly &s;trengthened by &s;hye|ne&s;s, re&s;ervedne&s;s, and apparent reluctance to unbo&s;om our&s;elves, and &s;peak our minds freely to one another upon all religious &s;ubjects. I am ve|rily per&s;uaded, that many unhappy, mi&s;under|&s;tandings, and wide divi&s;ions, which have terri|bly rent the churches of CHRIST, might have been prevented, or &s;peedily healed by &s;uch an o|pen, hone&s;t, ingenuous proceedure. Such an up|right,
<PB N="25" REF="010873_0024_0F851BBAE54E6270">
chri&s;tian-like conduct in per&s;ons, who might not intirely agree in &s;entiments with their brethren in all points, would be the likelie&s;t way to their receiving light, if they were in an error; or enable them to admini&s;ter conviction to their brethren, if the error &s;hould be on their &s;ide. At the &s;ame time &s;uch an open, hone&s;t behavi|our would very powerfully invite to mutual con|de&s;cention, even where they could not after all fully agree in le&s;&s;er, circum&s;tantial matters. Whereas a contrary conduct unavoidably gives ju&s;t occa&s;ion for di&s;tru&s;t and jealou&s;ies. There is ju&s;t rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect a per&s;on, who is not wil|ling to u&s;e the greate&s;t freedom, openne&s;s, and plainne&s;s of &s;peech in declaring his religious &s;enti|ments. In all &s;uch ca&s;es, common &s;en&s;e will dictate, that there is ju&s;t ground for &s;u&s;picion. Nor will it be at all &s;trange, if, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, per&s;ons &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected of holding wor&s;e, and more erroneous tenets, than they really do. And if this &s;hould happen to be the ca&s;e, they can ju&s;tly blame no-body but them&s;elves, and ought in ju&s;tice to impute it to their own culpable unwil|lingne&s;s to &s;peak plainly in a known tongue, with|out affecting the covert of ambiguity. And then farther, there is &s;omething &s;o inexpre&s;&s;ibly charm|ing, engaging &amp; winning in right down openne&s;s, and hone&s;t, plain dealing in the&s;e matters, that it cannot fail to conciliate re&s;pect and e&s;teem, and
<PB N="26" REF="010873_0025_0F851BBE84819080">
mightily promote Love and Union among chri&s;|tian brethren.</P>
<P>And then the important Liberty of the church|es, wherewith CHRIST hath made them free, can't be too &s;olicitou&s;ly, and tenderly regarded by us, when rightly under&s;tood. Now this Liber|ty of the churches is e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame with the right of private Judgment in Individuals, and in|cludes the &s;ame things; as for in&s;tance, the churches Right and Liberty to think and judge for them&s;elves; to wor&s;hip GOD according to their own Con&s;ciences, to choo&s;e their own mi|ni&s;ters, and to determine for them&s;elves, what form of church di&s;cipline they judge to be mo&s;t agreeable to the word of GOD; and with what churches and mini&s;ters they will choo&s;e to walk in &s;tated Union and Communion, and with whom they will not, as judging it not con&s;i&s;tent with their purity and &s;afety, or not conducive to their Edification, according to the word of God. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">It is here to be carefully ob&s;erved, that the true liberty of particular churches con&s;i&s;ts in their Right of choo&s;ing their own Con&s;titution, or Form of Church Government, which they &s;hall judge to be pointed out by CHRIST in his Word; and in de|termining for them&s;elves, whether they will be Independent, or Con&s;ociated with other neighbouring churches, and walk in &s;trict Union with them, in tran&s;acting the more weighty and important matters relative to the churches, (as the Ordination, Removal or Depo&s;ition of Mini&s;ters, or any difficult ca&s;es of di&s;cipline) ac|cording to &s;uch Rules and Orders, as they &s;hall judge to be a|greeable to the Word of GOD, mo&s;t conducive to their peace and e|dification. Here they have full, intire Liberty. And when they have freely come into &s;uch a voluntary Union with other church|es, it is no Diminution of their Liberty, but rather the heighth and full Enjoyment of it, to be &s;ubject to the Rules and Conditions of this Union. And in perfect con&s;i&s;tency with Freedom, they are evidently obliged to a &s;trict ob&s;ervance of this Agreement, until they &s;hall be convinced in their con&s;ciences, that this Agree|ment or Union is un&s;criptural and wrong. And if that &s;hould be the ca&s;e, 'twill then be their indi&s;pen&s;able duty, to &s;ignify to the other churches their change of Sentiments, either with re&s;pect to principles, or the Plan and Rules of their Union, freely propo&s;ing to con&s;ideration their difficulties, &s;cruples and objections. And if they &s;hall not get them removed, or convince their brethren, then they may peaceably <HI>di&s;&s;ent,</HI> or withdraw from that &s;pecial Union, without any ju&s;t Offence. But the renouncing of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titution, or breaking over the rules of it, without taking the&s;e previous mea&s;ures, is evidently a di&s;orderly and unchri&s;tian Sepa|ration, and ought to be treated as &s;uch. And &s;uch a conduct is yet more criminal in any church or mini&s;ter, when they appre|hend them&s;elves liable to be called to an Account, or cen&s;ured, for di&s;orderly walking, by the body of churches with which they have been united. This mu&s;t be deemed a meer &s;ham de|&s;ign, attended with all the aggravating circum&s;tances of a clan|de&s;tine attempt to e&s;cape from ju&s;tice, which can't be the lea&s;t rea&s;on why they &s;hould not be proceeded again&s;t in a way of Cen&s;ure.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="010873_0026_0F851BBF6E715BC8">Now I apprehend, that &s;peaking plainly, in|telligibly, and unre&s;ervedly in the church, and upon all &s;ubjects relative thereto, is very condu|cive, and highly nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of this important liberty.

And &s;uch a knowledge of each o|thers belief, and religious &s;entiments, as can be obtained only by &s;peaking plainly, and intelligi|bly, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to their walking toge|ther con&s;i&s;tently in the Fellow&s;hip of the Go&s;pel.

Sup|po&s;e I am concerned with a church, or a number of churches and mini&s;ters, of whom a great ma|ny, or even the greater part, labour under unhap|py prejudices and mi&s;takes; perhaps they are narrow, contracted and bigotted in their &s;enti|ments, and lay a mighty &s;tre&s;s upon &s;ome meer circum&s;tantials, in which I cannot agree with them; and if I &s;hould open my mind freely up|on all religious &s;ubjects, they would reject me, and not hold communion with me; may I not in that ca&s;e keep upon the re&s;erve, or deal a lit|tle in doubtful, ambiguous expre&s;&s;ions, which I apprehend they will under&s;tand in a &s;en&s;e diffe|rent from what I really intend, in both which &s;en&s;es the words will well bear to be under&s;tood? May I not prudently do this with an hone&s;t view and de&s;ign to in&s;truct them better, and gradually bring them off from their unrea&s;onable prejudi|ces, as I &s;hall find they will be able to bear it?

It is true, they may err, and hold tho&s;e things to be of great im|portance, or even e&s;&s;ential, which I believe, or know to be otherwi&s;e; and for this they mu&s;t an&s;wer to GOD another day: and I &s;hall act a very chri&s;tian part, in labouring to convince them of their mi&s;takes, and in&s;piring them with more ju&s;t and generous &s;entiments, if I can. But then after all, they have as good a right to judge for <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> as I have to judge for <HI>my&s;elf</HI>; and to determine for them&s;elves, what truths are of high importance, or e&s;&s;ential in religion, as I have to determine for my&s;elf in the&s;e matters. And
<PB N="32" REF="010873_0031_0F851BC329F43048">
if herein they gro&s;sly err, they are accountable to GOD for it; not to me. And if I pre&s;ume to make <HI>my</HI> judgment a rule for them, I encroach upon their Liberty, and deny them that right of judging for them&s;elves, which I claim to my|&s;elf, which does not very much breathe the true &s;pirit of Liberty and Freedom.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e there to be a number of <HI>Roman-catholic</HI> churches in any particular place, who firmly believed the Infallibility of the Pope, the doctrines of Purgatory and Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation to be &s;o e&s;&s;ential in religion, that they could not in con&s;cience receive any mini&s;ter or member, who could not profe&s;s his belief of the &s;ame; I con|ceive they have a clear and indi&s;putable right, <HI>in the &s;ight of men,</HI> to believe and judge for them|&s;elves concerning the truth and importance of the&s;e points; and no men upon earth have any right to hinder them from practi&s;ing conforma|bly to the&s;e erroneous &s;entiments, provided they be otherwi&s;e peaceable, orderly members of Soci|ety. They may be ju&s;tly blamed for holding &s;uch ab&s;urd tonets, contrary to the go&s;pel; but they cannot be ju&s;tly accu&s;ed of invading the rights, or of doing any thing again&s;t the liberty of other per&s;ons or churches, while they readily allow to others the &s;ame right of judging and acting for them&s;elves. And if I, being a prote&s;|tant, &s;hould endeavour to get into the communi|on or mini&s;try, in the&s;e churches, by concealing
<PB N="33" REF="010873_0032_0F851BC442D97630">
or di&s;gui&s;ing my true principles upon the&s;e points, I &s;hould be a criminal invader of their liberty: becau&s;e they have a clear right, in con&s;equence of their principles, to reject me from their com|munion, and I mu&s;t wor&s;hip by my&s;elf, which is the only liberty and privilege they claim to them|&s;elves. And if I &s;hould call their conduct in this matter, tyranny, or an arbitrary infringment up|on my liberty, I &s;hould be guilty of as gro&s;s im|propriety of &s;peech, as if I termed it murder, a|dultery, or high trea&s;on. I ought to pity them for their ignorance, &s;uper&s;tition and errors; and may ju&s;tly blame them for departing from the truths of divine revelation: but cannot, with a|ny propriety, accu&s;e them of violating the prin|ciples of chri&s;tian liberty, and &s;hall be guilty of the greate&s;t Impertinency in bringing &s;uch a charge again&s;t them. 'Tis true, their mi&s;takes and errors will be attended with <HI>prejudicial ef|fects and con&s;equences</HI> to me; ju&s;t as any per&s;on's imprudent di&s;po&s;al, or wrong application of his own private property will always be con&s;equenti|ally detrimental to the welfare of the community.</P>
<P>On the other hand, &s;hould I endeavour to get into the communion, or mini&s;try in one of the&s;e churches, even with the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted de|&s;ign to reclaim them from their errors, and &s;hould &s;ucceed in my attempt, by concealing my real tho' true &s;entiments from them, they would have
<PB N="34" REF="010873_0033_0F851BC4C7C7E9B0">
very ju&s;t rea&s;on to complain of me, as invading their liberty, and doing the &s;ame thing in effect, as if, having it in my power, I had forced a member, or mini&s;ter upon them contrary to their mind, judgment and choice. They might ju&s;t|ly complain of me, as injuriou&s;ly di&s;turbing them in the enjoyment of their undoubted right, and liberties, and treat me as <HI>a fal&s;e brother,</HI> crept <HI>in privily, unawares</HI> to them, <HI>to &s;py out their liberty, in order to de&s;troy it, and bring them into bondage.</HI> And I may venture to affirm, that the de&s;tructi|on of liberty, both in church and &s;tate, is much oftner effected by &s;uch clande&s;tine, delu&s;ive mea|&s;ures, than by the open exertions of power. And therefore the true liberty of the churches is in the greate&s;t danger from this quarter. And &s;peak|ing in the mo&s;t plain, open, intelligible manner upon all religious &s;ubjects, according to the be|lief, and real &s;entiments of our Hearts, is evident|ly nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of this de&s;irable and important Liberty; and is the mo&s;t effectual guard again&s;t eccle&s;ia&s;tical Tyranny.</P>
<P N="8">8. Speaking in an unknown tongue in the church is &s;ymbolizing with the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> in one in|&s;tance of their conduct, ju&s;tly condemned by all Prote&s;tants.</P>
<P>The <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> &s;ay their public prayers in the church, in a language unknown to the common people. A mo&s;t ab&s;urd ridiculous practice. For
<PB N="35" REF="010873_0034_0F851BC5732696D8">
however well they may pray in the &s;pirit, 'tis cer|tain that tho&s;e who hear, cannot &s;afely &s;ay, Amen, to their prayers, or join in the wor&s;hip. But all de&s;ignedly unintelligible &s;peaking in the church partakes of the very nature and effence of this ab|&s;urdity, and is &s;o far a verging towards popery.</P>
<P N="9">9. The infinite importance of religious &s;ubjects is a weighty rea&s;on, why we &s;hould &s;peak upon them in the mo&s;t plain, intelligible manner.</P>
<P>This con&s;ideration gives force to all the pre|ceeding rea&s;ons. In matters of &s;mall concern|ment there may be &s;ome allowance for trifling. But to trifle in the church of GOD, with religion, with the go&s;pel, is very horrible, and ab&s;olutely in|tolerable. Here the Glory of GOD, the liberty and welfare of the church, which he hath pur|cha&s;ed with his own blood; here the endle&s;s hap|pine&s;s or mi&s;ery of immortal &s;ouls is very nearly concerned. Certainly where &s;uch infinitely weighty con&s;equences are depending, the greate&s;t plainne&s;s of &s;peech is highly important. That which is of importance enough to be &s;poken in the church, ought to be clearly under&s;tood. And indeed the mo&s;t of &s;ubjects, proper to be treated upon in the church, are &s;o intere&s;ting in their na|ture, and practical con&s;equences, that 'tis of high concernment they be clearly and rightly under|&s;tood. Such as the doctrines concerning the Per|&s;on, Natures, and Offices of CHRIST: the doc|trines
<PB N="36" REF="010873_0035_0F851BC623EB9A38">
of faith, repentance, &amp;c. How can the ho|ne&s;t <HI>Arian,</HI> who believes our Saviour to be only a meer creature, per&s;i&s;t in applying the name and titles of GOD to him, without ever clearly inform|ing his hearers, that he is only a God, in a lower &s;en&s;e, as angels and civil rulers are &s;tiled Gods in &s;cripture?&mdash;how can he let them go on de|ceived, as they mu&s;t be, <HI>in his opinion,</HI> in the very Object of their Wor&s;hip, paying divine homage and honours to one, who is not by nature true e|ternal GOD, and be thereby a&s;&s;i&s;ting to their ido|latry? And I may &s;ay in general, that 'tis utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with integrity, and is a violation of one of the mo&s;t &s;acred tru&s;ts, ever committed to mortals, to neglect declaring in the mo&s;t plain, intelligible language, what we take to be the truths of GOD revealed in his word. Since there|fore the &s;ubjects treated on are &s;o important; &s;ince GOD &s;peaks plainly in his word, and the Spirit &s;peaks plainly, and the grand de&s;ign of all &s;peak|ing, is to be clearly under&s;tood, tho&s;e that &s;peak in the church &s;hould u&s;e great plainne&s;s of &s;peech, that all who hear may rightly under&s;tand the things that belong to their everla&s;ting peace.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. We hence infer it to be very nece&s;&s;ary, that all who &s;peak, as public teachers in the church, &s;hould have clear ideas of divine things, and be well acquainted with language.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="010873_0036_0F851BC9CD266CB0">It is a very ju&s;t ob&s;ervation, that the having of clear ideas is very conducive, and highly nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peaking clearly and intelligibly upon any &s;ub|ject. And the rea&s;on is very obvious; for if the conceptions of the mind are confu&s;ed, this con|fu&s;ion of thinking will unavoidably run into a per|&s;on's di&s;cour&s;e, and leave a vi&s;ible tincture of it|&s;elf in his Speaking. Language is the picture of the mind's thoughts; and will therefore natural|ly bear a re&s;emblance thereto, in point of clear|ne&s;s or confu&s;ion. How then can he be &s;up|po&s;ed to &s;peak clearly, who&s;e mind is always be|clouded with the thick fogs of confu&s;edly float|ing vague ideas? In order to avoid this mi&s;chief, it is highly nece&s;&s;ary, that mini&s;ters &s;hould be much devoted, not only to reading, but al&s;o to meditation, clo&s;e thinking, and <HI>writing</HI> too; and not content them&s;elves with uncertain, fa&s;hiona|ble &s;ounds, in &s;tead of clear, determinate ideas. And then in order to be apt to teach, it is plainly requi&s;ite, that a per&s;on be well &s;killed in the lan|guage he u&s;es in teaching. Indeed the know|ledge of the original languages, in which the &s;criptures were written, which are the words the Holy Gho&s;t hath taught, is for many weighty rea|&s;ons highly advantageous; that &s;o per&s;ons may be able to go to tho&s;e &s;acred Fountains of divine knowledge, &amp; &s;ee, and judge for them&s;elves, com|paring &s;cripture with &s;cripture. For the be&s;t
<PB N="38" REF="010873_0037_0F851BCA766A38B8">
tran&s;lation is, in a &s;ort, an human performance, and partakes of the general nature of the tran&s;|lators confe&s;&s;ion of their faith, or a declaration of what they take to be the true meaning of the words u&s;ed here and there, in the &s;acred Origi|nal. Indeed our tran&s;lation of the Bible is &s;o confe&s;&s;edly ju&s;t, that it may be &s;afely regarded and relied upon, as a true declaration of the mind and will of GOD in all material points; and ought to be very thankfully prized, as a mo&s;t invaluable Ble&s;&s;ing, whereby GOD &s;peaks to us in a known tongue, if we will be at the pains to &s;tudy the &s;criptures, and compare one place with ano|ther. And certainly the &s;tudy of the Engli&s;h language, &s;o as to be accurately acquainted with the true import, and preci&s;e meaning of the words e&s;pecially as they are u&s;ed in the &s;criptures, is exceedingly requi&s;ite for tho&s;e who &s;peak in the church of GOD, or preach the go&s;pel. With|out this, we &s;hall be in great danger of mi&s;|leading and mi&s;guiding tho&s;e that hear us.</P>
<P N="2">II. We &s;hould, as much as po&s;&s;ible, avoid all ambiguous expre&s;&s;ions, or words of a double, doubtful meaning, in &s;peaking in the church.</P>
<P>Words are &s;aid to be an unknown tongue, for this rea&s;on only, that their <HI>meaning</HI> is unknown, or cannot be determined by the hearer. And when this is the ca&s;e, it makes no material diffe|rence, whether the words be Engli&s;h, Greek, or
<PB N="39" REF="010873_0038_0F851BCBE5D65EF0">
Hebrew. And this is evidently the ca&s;e with all ambiguous words: for as they are frequently u&s;ed in different, or perhaps contrary &s;en&s;es, the hearer cannot know in what &s;en&s;e the &s;peak|er intends them, unle&s;s he defines them by other words, to &s;hew their meaning. They an&s;wer exactly to the Apo&s;tle's de&s;cription of, <HI>words not ea&s;y to be under&s;tood</HI>; by which it cannot be <HI>known,</HI> what is &s;poken. Hence they are &s;o fitly repre|&s;ented by a trumpet that gives an <HI>uncertain &s;ound.</HI></P>
<P>It is true indeed, the hearers may them&s;elves have right ideas annexed to the&s;e words: but then it is al&s;o very probable they may have wrong ones. And in that ca&s;e, we &s;hall be all the while teaching them error, and not the truths of GOD, if we dont carefully define, and explain the mean|ing of our words. Should any, for in&s;tance, get to conceive, that the title of GOD, when applied to our REDEEMER, intends only <HI>a God by Office</HI>; and that notwith&s;tanding this, he is only an ex|alted creature: our calling him GOD ever &s;o of|ten, without clearly defining what we mean by the term, would only &s;erve to confirm them in this their fal&s;e opinion, and &s;erve to uphold, and &s;trength|en them in denying the only LORD that bought them. The &s;ame might be ob&s;erved concerning the words, faith, repentance, grace, ju&s;tification, &amp;c. Where the frequent u&s;e of the words, with|out a clear, preci&s;e definition of what we mean by them, will give no in&s;truction, and may be as like|ly
<PB N="40" REF="010873_0039_0F851BCC2BFB0880">
to lead into error, as to convey the know|ledge of the truth. Since therefore &s;uch is the imperfection of human language, the careful ex|plaining of our meaning is an incumbent duty of high importance, and the neglect of it is an un|pardonable with-holding of in&s;truction and knowledge from the church of GOD, which we are appointed to teach and feed: Yea, 'tis a prac|tical declaring in the Name of GOD, that we will not explain to them what the &s;cripture &s;aith, and what GOD hath revealed in his word con|cerning the&s;e things. Mu&s;t not this approach near to the &s;in of perjury, in tho&s;e who have bound them&s;elves by &s;olemn vowes to be witne&s;&s;es to the truth. Let us then, as faithful witne&s;&s;es for GOD, u&s;e great plainne&s;s of &s;peech, while we are profe&s;&s;edly endeavouring to make known the whole coun&s;el of GOD, in the knowledge of which the &s;alvation of tho&s;e immortal &s;ouls, for which CHRIST died, is very nearly concerned. To this we are mo&s;t &s;acredly bound, as we de&s;ire to &s;ave the &s;ouls that hear us;&mdash;as we would pro|mote brotherly love, that great chri&s;tian duty, and di&s;tingui&s;hing badge of CHRIST's di&s;ci|ples, and as we would pre&s;erve, and perpetuate the important Liberty of the churches.</P>
