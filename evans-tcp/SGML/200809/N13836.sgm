<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THAT <HI>Mankind Univer&s;ally</HI> &s;hall, in the final i&s;&s;ue of the Go&s;pel plan of mercy, be delivered from the bondage of corruption, and be admitted to the felicity of the &s;ons of God, is no <HI>novel doctrine,</HI> as many may be ready to imagine. It was (as &s;ome writers upon this &s;ubject have ob&s;erved) received as a <HI>revealed truth</HI> by Origen and Clement of Alexandria, who both lived in the latter end of the Second Century, And it appears from Augu&s;tin, Jerom, and other celebrated writers, in their day, that it was not then either a <HI>new</HI> or <HI>uncommon</HI> tenet. And, in later times, a variety of books have been publi&s;hed in favour of it, in the French, High-Dutch, Low-Dutch and Engli&s;h languages. There is al&s;o an ingenious piece&punc; written in French by a noble mini&s;ter of the court of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, &s;tiled <HI>A Treati&s;e on the Univer&s;al Re&s;ti|tution of the Creation.</HI> A con&s;iderable number of other books, upon the &s;ame &s;ubject, are now extant in <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> I &s;hall only mention one or two out of many others. <HI>Jeremiah White,</HI> chap|lain to Oliver Cromwel, and an eminently pious, good man, has writ a large book, in <HI>Vindication of God's goodne&s;s to be manife&s;ted, at la&s;t, in
<PB N="ii" REF="017489_0003_0FA1239DEEF4E3A8">
the recovery of the whole lower creation from the fall.</HI> From this book many of the following extracts are made: <HI>Dr. David Hartley,</HI> in his <HI>ob|&s;ervations upon man,</HI> has &s;everal chapters upon <HI>&s;alvation for all men</HI>; from which I may collect &s;ome thoughts in the following work. I &s;hall &s;ay of him, he was a man of known &s;erious piety, a di&s;ciple of Mr. <HI>John We&s;ley,</HI> and in common with him and all his followers, a believer in the <HI>Re&s;toration of all mankind, in God's time and way, to final happine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>It may not be un&s;ea&s;onable to add here, that it is freely and fully acknowledged, by all the above writers, that <HI>many,</HI> among the &s;ons and daughters of Adam, will pa&s;s through a &s;tate of <HI>unutterable mi&s;ery</HI>; before they will be pre|pared for, and admitted to the joys of God's pre&s;ence, in the heavenly world.</P>
<P>This I judge proper to mention, becau&s;e the doctrine of <HI>Univer&s;al Salvation</HI> has in this, and &s;ome other towns, been held forth by a &s;tranger, who has, of him&s;elf, a&s;&s;umed the character of a <HI>preacher,</HI> in direct contradiction not only to all the before mentioned writers, but to the <HI>whole tenor of the New-Te&s;tament-books, from their beginning to their end.</HI> According to this <HI>preacher,</HI> a man may go to heaven, notwith|&s;tanding all the &s;ins he has been guilty of in the
<PB N="iii" REF="017489_0004_0FA1239FF1FD7470">
cour&s;e of his life. Such a doctrine looks very like an <HI>encouragement</HI> to <HI>Libertini&s;m,</HI> and falls in with the &s;cheme of too many in this degenerate age, who, under pretence of <HI>promoting religion, undermine it at the very root.</HI> It is certainly fitted to this end, and has already had this effect upon many, e&s;pecially of our younger people, who, by means of it, have lo&s;t all &s;en&s;e of religion, and given them&s;elves up to the mo&s;t criminal exce&s;&s;es! If this kind of preaching is encouraged, it may prove as hurtful to <HI>civil &s;ociety</HI> as to <HI>religion.</HI></P>
<P>Would to God it might be realized as an <HI>undoubted truth,</HI> that there is the &s;ame rea&s;on, from &s;cripture, to believe there is a <HI>HELL</HI> as a <HI>HEAVEN.</HI> And tho&s;e who are infidels as to the former, would do well to take care le&s;t they &s;hould know, from their <HI>own experience,</HI> the <HI>horrors</HI> of that <HI>dreadful place.</HI></P>
<P>The doctrine held forth, in the following extracts is capable (as is the truth with every other doctrine) of being perverted and abu&s;ed. If any &s;hould be &s;o di&s;ingenuous, as to turn <HI>this grace into wantonne&s;s,</HI> they can reflect the blame no where but on them&s;elves, if they are made to &s;uffer, God only knows how <HI>long,</HI> or to what an <HI>awful degree,</HI> in the future &s;tate.</P>

<HEAD>Salvation for all Men.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER &s;ome pertinent ob&s;ervations, the pious and ingenious Mr. <HI>White</HI> proceeds in the fol|lowing manner.&mdash;"And here I do, in the fear of God, mo&s;t humbly pro&s;trate my&s;elf before his divine maje&s;ty, and in the deepe&s;t &s;en&s;e of my own darkne&s;s and di&s;tance from him, do, with all my might, beg of that in|finite goodne&s;s I am endeavouring to repre&s;ent to others, that if &s;omething like to this platform and pro&s;pect of things be not agreeable to that revealed and natural light he hath given to us, that my undertaking may be interrupted; my de&s;ign fall; and that the Lord would pardon my attempt. And I know he will do &s;o, for he hath given me to have no further concern in this matter, than as I apprehend it to be a mo&s;t glo|rious truth, witne&s;&s;ed to both by the &s;criptures of truth, and by the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential principles of our own rea&s;on, and which will be found &s;o at the la&s;t opening of the go&s;pel, to recover, in that opening, a degenerate world. But if this be a true repre&s;entation of the glorious de&s;ign of the ever ble&s;&s;ed goodne&s;s of the great God, who is goodne&s;s it&s;elf; and if the holy &s;criptures and right rea&s;on do bear witne&s;s unto it, how clear, how fair, how open lies the way before us to ju&s;tify the &s;overeign power, and di&s;po&s;e of God, which he exerci&s;es by Election and Reprobation too, with all the methods he u&s;es in his holy and glorious wi&s;dom and prudence, in giving way to the entrance of &s;in, and then inflaming the angui&s;h of it by the law, that he
<PB N="2" REF="017489_0006_0FA123A0F000AE58">
may thereby have occa&s;ion to glorify his wrath again&s;t it, and his ju&s;tice; and &s;o make his way to the more glorious illu&s;tration of his grace and love in the clo&s;e.</P>
<P>In this account and pro&s;pect, there is, as we &s;hall &s;ee in the &s;equel of this di&s;cour&s;e, nothing omitted, nothing excluded, of all the ways and methods of God with men, which have been, by good minds, variou&s;ly con|tended for. Here his univer&s;al grace doth no longer thru&s;t out his &s;pecial and peculiar favour. <HI>Reprobation</HI> here will be found con&s;i&s;ting with <HI>Election,</HI> yea, <HI>Dam|nation</HI> it&s;elf with <HI>Salvation.</HI> Here all tho&s;e knots which other &s;y&s;tems of divinity have tied fa&s;ter, are in a great mea&s;ure loofned. Here all tho&s;e difficulties, in the Chri&s;tian religion, which have &s;o long perplexed the more thinking and enquiring minds, are, if not quite removed, at lea&s;t made &s;o ea&s;y, that we may, with &s;ome contentment and plea&s;ure, wait for that &s;tate which can alone perfectly &s;atisfy us. And yet, all this while, nothing of moment in Chri&s;tianity is any way a&s;&s;aulted and &s;haken, but all is much better e&s;tabli&s;hed and confirmed, being hereby made one entire piece mo&s;t pure and plea&s;ant, from the highe&s;t truth, and the highe&s;t good, meeting both in one, throughout the whole contrivance.</P>
<P>Here all tho&s;e fal&s;e, barbarous and mon&s;trous re|pre&s;entations of a God are taken away, which have hitherto hindred &s;o many minds (otherwi&s;e ingenuous) from owning him, for fear they &s;hould, at the &s;ame time they acknowledge the &s;upreme Being, reproach and bla&s;pheme him, by leaving out the highe&s;t and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential perfection of the Deity, which is good|ne&s;s, or at lea&s;t making it more narrow and contracted than that of a finite imperfect creature.</P>
<P>Here, in a word, all the &s;cenes of time, and all things done therein, are with at un&s;peakable plea&s;ure di&s;co|vered
<PB N="3" REF="017489_0007_0FA123A1AF9FB238">
and &s;een to be invironed, encompa&s;&s;ed, enfolded in the arms and embraces of eternity, lying down and re&s;ting there, as in the end to which they were eter|nally ordained.</P>
<P>He is not a Chri&s;tian, he is not a man, he hath put off the tenderne&s;s and bowels of a man, he hath lo&s;t humanity it&s;elf, he hath not &s;o much charity as Dives expre&s;&s;ed in Hell, that cannot readily cry out,&mdash; <HI>this is good news, if it be true:</HI> that will not &s;ay <HI>Amen</HI> to it, provided it be agreeable to God, and what his word will countenance and own. For under no other law or condition can we groundedly rejoice in any doctrine, than as it bears the impre&s;s and &s;tamp of divine authority, and tends to his glory, to which all mu&s;t bow; for heaven it&s;elf mu&s;t pa&s;s away, rather than the go&s;pel be innovated, or another go&s;pel broach|ed, how gratifying or acceptable &s;oever to our fle&s;hly minds. Upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, therefore, I conclude this doctrine mu&s;t be acceptable and welcome to every <HI>good man.</HI></P>
<P>I have often ob&s;erved, with admiration and plea&s;ure, tho&s;e mo&s;t affectionate irruptions of &s;pirit and pangs of love in Mo&s;es and Paul. <HI>Blot me out of thy book,</HI> &s;ays one; <HI>I could be accur&s;ed from Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;ays the other: for the &s;ake of my brethren, I &s;ometimes feel &s;o much of the &s;ame love working in my &s;oul, that I verily believe, a man, thoroughly acted by a &s;pirit of goodne&s;s, would be ever content to live in a bani&s;hment from God, I mean from the &s;weet illap&s;es and touches of his love, &s;o that he might be without &s;in, rather than any of God's creation &s;hould be ever unacquainted with him: and therefore, he thinks it would be the be&s;t employment and greate&s;t happine&s;s, in the world, to be u&s;ed as an in&s;trument to &s;uch an <HI>univer&s;al good.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="017489_0008_0FA123A2707CB070">And whil&s;t I &s;ometimes entertain my&s;elf with &s;uch thoughts as the&s;e, I feel a &s;ecret joy &s;pringing in my &s;oul, and whi&s;pering to me, if there be &s;o much love in a <HI>drop,</HI> in a <HI>beam</HI> in a <HI>creature,</HI> there mu&s;t &s;ure be infinitely more in the <HI>ocean,</HI> in the <HI>&s;un,</HI> in <HI>God</HI> him&s;elf. I find all the&s;e good de&s;ires and cares in my&s;elf &s;wal|lowed up by the di&s;covery of an object, which is all goodne&s;s and omnipotence, an infinitely wi&s;e and al|mighty goodne&s;s; and a ravi&s;hing &s;ight of all things already lying in his tender arms, and &s;acred embraces; who, in his &s;overeign and incomprehen&s;ible wi&s;dom, hath &s;till been conducting them through all their va|rious intricacies, for a greater good and glory."</P>
<P>Having ended his introduction, which breathes a &s;pirit of piety and benevolence, our author proceeds to confirm the doctrine of an <HI>Univer&s;al Re&s;toration of the human race,</HI> by a variety of te&s;timonies, from &s;cripture. I &s;hall not quote every thing he advances under each head, as that would &s;well this work to too large a &s;ize: But, in as few words as po&s;&s;ible, I &s;hall endeavour to give you his ideas.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t text he produces is from the 1&s;t Epi&s;tle of Timothy ii. 3.&mdash;<HI>God our &s;aviour, who will have all men to be &s;aved and come to the knowledge of the truth.</HI> Upon which he ob&s;erves&mdash;"The letter of this text is full and expre&s;s; God will have ALL MEN to be &s;aved, and &s;hould we pre&s;s it, there are almo&s;t as many argu|ments as words. For 1&s;t, It is not &s;aid God <HI>would</HI> have all to be &s;aved by his <HI>good will,</HI> but that he <HI>authoritatively wills it: wills</HI> it as a being of &s;upreme, uncontroulable power, a being that <HI>will</HI> be obeyed in &s;pite of the corrupt di&s;po&s;itions of men, or the
<PB N="5" REF="017489_0009_0FA123A330199170">
mi&s;chievous arts of devils. It is a <HI>fixed, determined, immutable</HI> will, no <HI>tran&s;ient,</HI> nor revocable. Thus <HI>power|fully</HI> and <HI>irre&s;i&s;tibly</HI> does God <HI>will all men to be &s;aved.</HI></P>
<P>And as he <HI>wills</HI> the end, &s;o does he <HI>will</HI> the <HI>ne|ce&s;&s;ary means</HI> leading to it. In order to their being <HI>&s;aved,</HI> he will have <HI>all men come to the knowledge of the truth.</HI> No man <HI>is</HI> or can be &s;anctified or &s;aved without the knowledge of the truth; God wills this therefore, that they be &s;aved, and that this means of &s;alvation &s;hall pa&s;s upon them.</P>
<P>Further&mdash;this will has its ground in the e&s;&s;ential benevolence of God's nature, The &s;alvation of all men is good and acceptable in his &s;ight. The words <HI>God our &s;aviour</HI> are not to be re&s;trained to the <HI>Elect,</HI> for that would not carry forth a will to &s;ave all men; this, therefore, is to be taken in the &s;ame latitude and extent with other places, where he is called <HI>the &s;aviour of all men,</HI> Ch. iv. 10. And <HI>God that quickneth all things.</HI> Ch. vi. 13. And our &s;aviour tells us, <HI>all things live to God.</HI> Luke xx. 38. And he is called <HI>the God of the &s;pirits of all fle&s;h.</HI> Numb. xvi. 22. And mark you, who is this &s;aviour? It is <HI>God,</HI> not <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> for of him he &s;peaks di&s;tinctly afterwards. But <HI>God</HI> the <HI>father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this principle therefore, that <HI>God wills the &s;alva|tion of men,</HI> he hath commanded us to pray for the whole world of mankind. He hath a&s;&s;ured us, this is peculiarly <HI>good and acceptable in his &s;ight,</HI> And with the highe&s;t rea&s;on, for it perfectly falls in with his gracious de&s;ign, and tends to bring it into effect. Neither does this over&s;et the doctrine of <HI>Election,</HI> as we &s;hall &s;hew in the &s;equel of this di&s;cour&s;e. For tho' <HI>many are called few are cho&s;en to happine&s;s in the</HI> NEXT <HI>&s;tate.</HI> When there|fore, we are required to <HI>pray for all men,</HI> even for their
<PB N="6" REF="017489_0010_0FA123A3EEEE38A0">
<HI>&s;alvation,</HI> it is not meant to throw down the di&s;tinction between the <HI>Elect</HI> and <HI>Reprobate.</HI> It is not meant to rever&s;e and alter God's decrees, whereby he hath given &s;ome the <HI>preheminence</HI> and <HI>double portion</HI> above others, but it is a &s;eeking that <HI>&s;alvation</HI> for <HI>all,</HI> which God hath prepared for them in <HI>his own time and way.</HI></P>
<P>It is the <HI>will</HI> of God then, that <HI>all men &s;hould be &s;aved.</HI> But remember, this <HI>will</HI> of his does not re&s;t in pitying men and wi&s;hing it were better with them. No, the <HI>will</HI> of God and his <HI>work</HI> are one. He <HI>wills</HI> nothing but he <HI>works</HI> it. Being an <HI>omnipotent</HI> and <HI>wi&s;e</HI> agent, he can never be re&s;i&s;ted. But in as much as he <HI>wills</HI> the &s;alvation of <HI>all men,</HI> he will finally bring it about; &s;o that the wickedne&s;s of the human heart &s;hall be tempered and &s;ubdued, the cur&s;e and wrath be done away, and a mo&s;t delightful and bli&s;sful harmony take place."</P>
<P>This rea&s;oning our author further illu&s;trates, by the following words.&mdash;<HI>For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and man, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, to be te&s;tified in due time.</HI> 5th and 6th ver&s;es.</P>
<P N="1">"1&s;t. <HI>There is one God,</HI> or more properly&mdash;<HI>God is one.</HI> That is, <HI>all men reprobate</HI> as well as <HI>elect,</HI> have <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>&s;elf &s;ame God.</HI> The <HI>Elect</HI> have not <HI>one</HI> God and <HI>Reprobate another;</HI> but <HI>one God</HI> is the God of them <HI>both.</HI> To adopt the words in Malachy ii. 10. <HI>Have we not all one father? Hath not one God created us? Yea, the &s;ame good and kind and merciful God and father made all.</HI> So then we &s;ee the ble&s;&s;ed God &s;tands in &s;ame near and tender relation to the whole human race.</P>
<P>Again&mdash; 2dly, The <HI>mediator is al&s;o one. One mediator,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <HI>between God and man.</HI> Here again, all men are recapitulated and headed in one, who is the
<PB N="7" REF="017489_0011_0FA123A4B594A8D8">
mediator of reconciliation, and of all communion of good from God to man, in whom, as &s;uch, all men have joint and equal intere&s;t. He is not &s;tyled a <HI>Mediator</HI> between <HI>God</HI> and the <HI>Elect,</HI> but between <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man,</HI> that is, <HI>All Men,</HI> All that come under the denomi|nation of men, as they have an intere&s;t in the great God as their common father, &s;o have they in his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t as their common mediator. Under this character, he is not nearer to one part of the human race than another. So that <HI>all men</HI> are under an equally gracious coun&s;el and de&s;ign of &s;alvation.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, This mediator <HI>gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all.</HI> The&s;e words can &s;ignify no le&s;s than <HI>general redemption. God wills that all men &s;hould be &s;aved,</HI> and therefore, he has given <HI>his &s;on a ran&s;om for all.</HI> Here a price is paid down, &s;uch as ju&s;tice required, and God was plea&s;ed to accept. And this <HI>univer&s;al ran&s;om</HI> is what the <HI>my&s;tical Jews</HI> can no more bear now, than the <HI>literal Jews</HI> could hear of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> being taken into the covenant of Abraham. One would imagine the apo&s;tle fore&s;aw what a grudging &s;pirit would prevail in the world. But the &s;criptures of the New Te&s;tament &s;peak yet more fully as touching this point. See Titus ii. 11. <HI>The grace of God, which bringeth &s;alvation to all men, hath appeared,</HI> &amp;c. i Tim. iv. 10. Rom. v. 18. 1 John ii. 2. <HI>If any man &s;in we have an advocate with the father, Je&s;us Chri&s;t the righteous, who is the pro|pitiation for</HI> OUR <HI>&s;ins, and not for ours only, but for the &s;ins of the</HI> WHOLE WORLD. A text &s;o worded, with a <HI>Not Only,</HI> and the <HI>Whole World,</HI> looks as if the &s;pirit had purpo&s;ely con&s;ulted to obviate and prevent all clippings of it.</P>
<P>But to come to the argument: From hence it will be &s;aid, what tho' <HI>Chri&s;t gives him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all,</HI> we &s;ee yet all men, nay the <HI>greate&s;t part</HI> of men, have
<PB N="8" REF="017489_0012_0FA123A5701A58A8">
no benefit by it, but live and die unreconciled to God. It is granted; but becau&s;e this redemption, this ran&s;om does not operate now, have we authority to &s;ay it never &s;hall? The blood of Chri&s;t never lo&s;es its virtue. Tho' the happy effects of his undertaking may not yet appear, yet the time will come when they &s;hall be univer&s;ally felt, and mo&s;t illu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;played. For which rea&s;on the apo&s;tle adds&mdash;<HI>to be te&s;tified in due time.</HI> The mean|ing of St. Paul is&mdash;that there &s;hall be a time, when it will be manife&s;t that <HI>all men</HI> are ran&s;omed and bought by the blood of Chri&s;t. God will not deny his &s;on the price of his blood. But before he gives up the kingdom, he &s;hall &s;ee of the travail of his &s;oul and be &s;atisfied. The reconciliation &s;hall finally operate upon all, and if the <HI>Elect</HI> are fir&s;t received to favour, the re&s;t &s;hall follow after in their proper order."</P>
<P>Another text produced by our author is in 1 Tim. iv. 10. <HI>The living God, who is the &s;aviour of all men, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e that believe.</HI>" Nothing could be more to our purpo&s;e than the&s;e words. They imply that God is the common &s;aviour of the whole human race, and yet that he is <HI>particularly</HI> &s;o of them that believe the go&s;pel of his &s;on. But the que&s;tion here is, what this <GAP DESC="foreign"> imports, <HI>chiefly</HI> of them that believe, where|in it is, that &s;ome, even of tho&s;e that believe, have the advantage of the re&s;t of men: Before we look further let us take what this place affords. And the &s;pecial ad|vantage of <HI>believers</HI> above other men is, that they are &s;aved from the wrath to come, &s;aved in the next &s;tate, and immediately upon the coming of Chri&s;t, are admitted to the heavenly happine&s;s. Others mu&s;t &s;tay for this; being unqualified for &s;uch felicity, they mu&s;t wait till they are bro't to a better temper of mind. Yet this does not prove that God is not <HI>their</HI> &s;aviour; becau&s;e he con|demns

them to &s;uffering, he has not ca&s;t them off. If you will turn to 1 Cor. xv. 22. &amp;c. and, you will &s;ee this matter fully cleared up. <HI>As in Adam all die, &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive, but every one in his own order, Chri&s;t the fir&s;t fruits, afterwards they that are Chri&s;t's at his coming: And when he &s;hall have put down all rule, authority and power, cometh the end.</HI> The argu|ment ari&s;ing from hence is, that believers will be rai&s;ed to everla&s;ting life at Chri&s;t's &s;econd coming; that unbe|lievers will be rai&s;ed too, but only in order to puni&s;h them in <HI>hell;</HI> and that when their puni&s;hment &s;hall have produced a proper effect, they will be recovered to the &s;ame happine&s;s with the &s;aints.

<P>From what has been &s;aid it appears that this term <GAP DESC="foreign"> is not quie&s;cent, idle, or in&s;ignificant, but im|porting a great difference between believers and others; yet not excluding the re&s;t altogether, or forever, from &s;alvation; nay it &s;trongly implies the contrary, it implies that <HI>all</HI> are or mu&s;t be &s;aved in one degree or another, and at &s;ome time or another."</P>
<P>The ingenious Mr. <HI>White</HI> pur&s;ues his &s;ubject, by re|ferring us next to Romans v. from the 15th to the 19th ver&s;e. <HI>But not as the offence, &s;o al&s;o is the free gift: for if through the offence of one, many be dead; much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man Je&s;us Chri&s;t, hath abounded unto many. And not as it was by one that &s;inned, &s;o is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto ju&s;tification. For if by one man's offence death reigned by one, much more they which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hall reign in life by one, Je&s;us Chri&s;t. There|fore,
<PB N="10" REF="017489_0014_0FA123A7B08E8EA8">
as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even &s;o by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of one, the free gift came upon all men, unto ju&s;tification of life. For as by one man's di&s;obedience many were made &s;inners, &s;o by the obedience of one &s;hall many be made righteous.</HI></P>
<P>"In the&s;e words, the gracious de&s;igns of God are laid open at large. <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> are oppo&s;ed to each other; the one as the &s;ource of <HI>&s;in</HI> and <HI>death,</HI> the other of <HI>life</HI> and <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> to the human race. Between the&s;e two, there is a parallel drawn by the apo&s;tle, &s;hewing wherein they agree, and wherein they differ. They agree in this, that they each, by turns, repre&s;ented mankind, and greatly affected tho&s;e they repre&s;ented, by their conduct. And in this they ma|terially differ, that one will be the occa&s;ion of much more <HI>good</HI> than the other was of <HI>hurt</HI> to the human &s;pecies. For thus we read, ver. 15. <HI>But not as the offence, &s;o al&s;o is the free gift, for if through the offence of one many be dead,</HI> MUCH MORE <HI>the grace of God, and the gift by grace, hath abounded unto many.</HI> I can|not conceive other meaning of the&s;e words than this. <HI>That there is much more in the heart of God to make men righteous by the &s;econd Adam, without their own per&s;onal merit, than to make men &s;inners by the fir&s;t Adam, without their per&s;onal demerit:</HI> Here you &s;ee, <HI>grace</HI> has the <HI>preference,</HI> in the plot, God hath a de|&s;ign to &s;hew his wrath, and to make his power known, but more to glorify his <HI>grace.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;econd difference is in the compari&s;on in&s;tituted between the one &s;in of Adam, charged upon all <HI>his</HI> &s;eed, and the abundance of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s imputed to <HI>his</HI> &s;eed. It was but one &s;lip, one tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and that was the eating forbidden fruit, that men &s;mart for to this day; but Chri&s;t performed <HI>many acts of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> he was all righteous, and therefore our many

offences are forgiven, and they who "receive abun|dance of grace; and the gift of righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hall reign in life by one man Je&s;us Chri&s;t." ver. 16, 17. yea, ver. 18. The apo&s;tle extends the re&s;pect and relation of this to <HI>all men</HI>; therefore, &s;ays he, <HI>as by the offence of one judgment came upon all to condemnation, even &s;o by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of one the free gift came upon all men to ju&s;tification of life.</HI> This is directly to my general argument. There is one offence upon <HI>all men</HI> to condemnation, and the righteou&s;ne&s;s of one upon <HI>all men</HI> to ju&s;tification. Tho' it is true, none but tho&s;e who <HI>now</HI> lay hold on it, have the <HI>immediate benefit</HI> of it yet, it was a price paid for <HI>all,</HI> and that many other &s;criptures do atte&s;t. And therefore the <HI>many,</HI> in the next ver&s;e, is not a bounding or limitation of the &s;cope and intention of Chri&s;t's death, but it is equivalent to the <HI>all</HI> before, el&s;e it &s;hould be le&s;s than the &s;everity, for <HI>all died in Adam</HI>&punc; and therefore, <HI>in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive.</HI> For as the grace and righteou&s;ne&s;s of the <HI>&s;econd Adam</HI> are much more than the &s;in of the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> &s;o the extent of them, with re&s;pect to the &s;ubject that reaps the benefit, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be <HI>le&s;s.</HI> We conclude therefore, with the apo&s;tle that <HI>as &s;in hath reigned univer&s;ally unto death, &s;o grace &s;hall reign through righteou&s;ne&s;s as univer&s;ally, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord. Grace</HI> will triumph at la&s;t. Though Chri&s;t has not yet reigned &s;o powerfully, as to bring into effect all the&s;e glorious advantages of his death, yet he will do it before the end; for he <HI>mu&s;t reign till he has put all enemies under his feet.</HI> And will not that <HI>end,</HI> when he &s;hall deliver up the kingdom to God&punc; even his father, when he &s;hall have de&s;troyed <HI>all the works of the Devil,</HI> when he &s;hall have exhibited acts of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t <HI>univer&s;al</HI> grace, be viewed with admiration by the whole intelligent creation, and celebrated with the loude&s;t anthems of prai&s;e!"</P>

And the word which is rendered to <HI>reconcile</HI> &s;ignifies to <HI>change</HI> a thing from a &s;tate of enmity to har|mony; to make it <HI>another thing</HI> from what it was.

&s;lain the enmity between them, and made provi&s;ion for an <HI>Univer&s;al re&s;toration to favour.</HI> The &s;ubject-matter upon which God means to act is evidently <HI>univer&s;al.</HI> This is expre&s;&s;ed by the <HI>comprehen&s;ive</HI> term ALL THINGS.

<P>And is there not power in the life and reign of Chri&s;t to do it? Is he not fully able to bring <HI>all things</HI> back to him&s;elf, as their proper head, and to continue them &s;o? Surely he is. And when he has once recovered them to him&s;elf, it will appear that none are able to tear them from him.

<P>Another text produced by the &s;ame writer, is the <HI>very fir&s;t</HI> that reveals the promi&s;e of a &s;aviour, and <HI>&s;um|marily</HI> comprehends the <HI>whole</HI> of what has been &s;aid concerning the <HI>reduction of mankind univer&s;ally</HI> to an <HI>obedient &s;ubjection</HI> to the governing will of God. The text is that Gene&s;is iii. 15.&mdash;<HI>And I will put enmity be|tween thee and the woman, and between thy &s;eed and her &s;eed: it &s;hall brui&s;e thy head, and thou &s;halt brui&s;e his heel.</HI> Expo&s;itors &s;eem univer&s;ally agreed, that <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> who was <HI>born of a woman,</HI> is the <HI>&s;eed</HI> here intended. And when 'tis affirmed of him, that <HI>he &s;hall brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head,</HI> the <HI>thought</HI> de&s;igned to be conveyed is the <HI>complete victory</HI> he &s;hould gain over the <HI>Devil,</HI> here &s;poken of under the emblem of a &s;erpent. For the words are evidently an allu&s;ion to the way of <HI>de&s;troying</HI> &s;erpents, by &s;triking at their head. To <HI>brui&s;e a &s;erpent's head</HI> is a phra&s;e expre&s;&s;ive of <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>&s;ame</HI> thing with <HI>killing a &s;erpent.</HI> Con&s;equently, when it is &s;aid of Chri&s;t, that he &s;hould <HI>brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head,</HI> the idea obviou&s;ly and naturally communicated by the words, is that he <HI>&s;hall de&s;troy the Devil,</HI> not his <HI>being,</HI> but that <HI>kingdom of his,</HI> which as a <HI>tempter,</HI> he had introduced into the world, accompanied with <HI>&s;orrow</HI> and <HI>death.</HI> I &s;ee not, but this <HI>fir&s;t promi&s;e</HI> of God fairly leads us to look for the time, when <HI>&s;in, that work of the Devil,</HI> &s;hall be totally and ab&s;olutely de&s;troyed, by him who was <HI>born of a woman.</HI> This is certainly the mo&s;t &s;imple and plain con&s;truction that can be put upon the words, if they refer to Chri&s;t, and his <HI>conque&s;t of the Devil,</HI> that is, of the <HI>kingdom of &s;in,</HI> he has been an in&s;trument of introducing into the world. So that the whole of what
<PB N="17" REF="017489_0021_0FA123AE71D850A0">
has been offered is nothing more than an enlargement upon that, which was <HI>&s;ummarily,</HI> and in a few &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ive words, delivered as the <HI>grand intention</HI> of God, in con&s;tituting his &s;on Je&s;us the &s;aviour of men. And I mu&s;t freely acknowledge, if the time does not come before Chri&s;t's delivery of the kingdom to the Father, when it &s;hall be true in <HI>event</HI> and <HI>fact,</HI> that SIN is totally <HI>de&s;troyed,</HI> by a reduction of <HI>all men</HI> under <HI>moral &s;ubjection</HI> to God, that it ought to be fairly and ho|ne&s;tly owned, that he has not <HI>brui&s;ed the &s;erpent's head,</HI> as it is declared that he &s;hould.

<P>Another text from this &s;ame writer, and the la&s;t I &s;hall bring to view, is recorded Revelation v. 13. <HI>And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and &s;uch as are in the &s;ea, and all that are in them, heard I &s;aying, ble&s;&s;ing and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that &s;itteth upon the throne, and unto the lamb for ever and ever.</HI></P>

For the <HI>whole human kind</HI> are to be found in the places here &s;pecified; and the &s;pecification of the&s;e places which contain them <HI>all</HI> is a &s;ure argument that he intended to comprehend them <HI>all.</HI> Why el&s;e &s;hould he be thus particular in &s;pecify|ing them? In &s;hort, the <HI>creatures</HI> the apo&s;tle John &s;aw paying their thankful acknowledgments, together with the angels, for the &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, were the <HI>whole po&s;terity of Adam, mankind,</HI> without ex|ception.

<P>Mr. Jo&s;eph Nicol Scott, in an&s;wer to this objection, &s;ays&mdash;"for my own part, I mu&s;t frankly confe&s;s, that after having, with repeated care, examined <HI>all</HI> the pa&s;|&s;ages of &s;cripture, that relate to the <HI>future puni&s;hment,</HI> I have not been able to find <HI>one &s;ingle text,</HI> in which this article of <HI>an eternal and endle&s;s mi&s;ery</HI> is either <HI>ex|pre&s;sly affirmed,</HI> or <HI>nece&s;&s;arily implied.</HI> And as to the term &s;o commonly tran&s;lated <HI>eternal, everla&s;ting, for ever and ever,</HI> it does not from any force of the word, imply what we mean by a <HI>&s;trict and proper eternity.</HI> The original words, both in the Hebrew and Greek, &s;ignify nothing more than an <HI>age,</HI> and in the plural <HI>ages,</HI> either <HI>longer</HI> or <HI>&s;horter, definite</HI> or <HI>indefinite.</HI>" Says another writer upon this &s;ubject, "there are hundreds of texts, in the old and new te&s;tament, in which this word, tran&s;lated eternal and forever, cannot po&s;&s;ibly mean more than a <HI>definite</HI> or <HI>indefinite duration,</HI> which may not be <HI>eternal.</HI> Gen. ix. 12. <HI>This</HI> (the rain-bow) <HI>is the token of the covenant
<PB N="20" REF="017489_0024_0FA123B0B0228A50">
between me and you, for</HI> PERPETUAL GENERATIONS. In the original it is, if tran&s;lated as the word is el&s;ewhere, &mdash;for <HI>eternal generations.</HI> Gen. xiii. 15. <HI>All the land which thou &s;ee&s;t, to thee will I give it, and to thy &s;eed</HI> FOR EVER. Gen. xvii. 8. <HI>I will give unto thee</HI> and to thy &s;eed, all the land of Canaan for an EVERLASTING POSSESSION. In the 13th ver. <HI>He that is born in thy hou&s;e, mu&s;t needs be circumci&s;ed, and my covenant &s;hall be in your fle&s;h for an</HI> EVERLASTING COVENANT. Exod. xii. 24. <HI>And ye &s;hall ob&s;erve this thing</HI> (the pa&s;&s;over) <HI>for an ordinance to thee and to thy &s;ons</HI> FOREVER. But there is no end of citing <HI>ordinances, &s;tatutes</HI> or <HI>grants,</HI> which were to be <HI>eternal, everla&s;ting</HI> and <HI>forever</HI> in our modern way of interpreting the <HI>original</HI> &s;cripture words, which yet were to la&s;t no longer, at the utmo&s;t, than the Mo&s;aic Oeconomy, and have cea&s;ed more than 1600 Years ago."</P>
<P>"And the &s;ame u&s;e of the&s;e words is retained in the New-Te&s;tament, as may be &s;een by the following texts. Matth. xxviii. 20. <HI>Lo I am with you even to the end of the world:</HI> So the Engli&s;h tran&s;lation is, becau&s;e the tran&s;lators found it nece&s;&s;ary. But had they tran&s;lated the Greek word here, as in other places, it mu&s;t have been to the <HI>end of eternity.</HI> The evangeli&s;t Luke &s;peaks of <HI>holy prophets which have been &s;ince the world began.</HI> But had the original been rendered, as in other places, it mu&s;t have been <HI>from eternity.</HI> I &s;hall take up no more time and room in citing texts to the purpo&s;e we are upon. The reader may, if he plea&s;es, look into the <HI>Greek Con|cordance,</HI> and he will there find, a greater number than he can well imagine." I &s;hall only &s;ay further here, from Dr. <HI>Hartley,</HI> that "it does not appear from the writings of the mo&s;t ancient fathers, that they con&s;trued the texts that &s;peak of the future puni&s;hment in the
<PB N="21" REF="017489_0025_0FA123B174DA9BF0">
<HI>never-ending</HI> &s;en&s;e. And the omi&s;&s;ion of this &s;en&s;e, in the <HI>ancient creeds,</HI> &s;hews that it was no <HI>original doctrine.</HI> And indeed the doctrine of <HI>Purgatory,</HI> as now taught by the papi&s;ts, &s;eems to be a corruption of a genuine doc|trine held by the ancient fathers, concerning that <HI>fire of hell</HI> which will <HI>burn out Sin and Lu&s;t.</HI>" He adds, "it may be, that the <HI>ab&s;olute eternity</HI> of puni&s;hment was not received, till after the introduction of metaphy&s;ical di&s;putes concerning time, eternity, and the ways of ex|pre&s;&s;ing the&s;e; that is, not till after the <HI>pagan philo&s;ophy</HI> and <HI>vain deceit</HI> had mixed them&s;elves with, and cor|rupted Chri&s;tianity."</P>
<P>"Another text applicable to our purpo&s;e, is Gal. i. 4. <HI>That he might deliver us from this pre&s;ent evil world.</HI> Had the original been rendered as in other places, it would have been&mdash;<HI>from this pre&s;ent evil eternity,</HI> which is palpable non&s;en&s;e. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of Luke xvi. 8. <HI>The children of this world are wi&s;er,</HI> &amp;c. In the Greek it is, <HI>the children of this Eternity,</HI> which the tran&s;lators knew would be an improper and ab&s;urd ren|dering of the <HI>Original Word.</HI>"</P>
<P>"It is objected, that the word <HI>eternal,</HI> the <HI>very word</HI> which is connected with the <HI>puni&s;hment</HI> of wicked men, is applied to <HI>God,</HI> repre&s;enting <HI>his &s;trict proper eternity;</HI> for which rea&s;on we may conclude, that the <HI>mi&s;ery</HI> of &s;inners, in the other world, will be <HI>endle&s;s,</HI> and therefore, incon&s;i&s;tent with their being finally &s;aved."</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this objection, a great number of writers upon the &s;ubject, unite in &s;aying,&mdash;"that the <HI>eternity</HI> of God cannot be argued from the mere force of the word rendered <HI>eternal.</HI> As it &s;ignifies duration either <HI>definite</HI> or <HI>indefinite,</HI> it may be applied as well to that which has <HI>no end,</HI> as to that which is of a determinate continuance.
<PB N="22" REF="017489_0026_0FA123B234E96130">
But then, it is the <HI>nature</HI> of the <HI>&s;ubject,</HI> and not the <HI>mere force</HI> of the word that mu&s;t a&s;certain its meaning. And did we not know, before hand, that <HI>eternity</HI> was an e&s;&s;ential attribute of God, it could never be argued from the application of this word to him."</P>
<P>"It is again objected, that the <HI>happine&s;s</HI> of good men, and the <HI>mi&s;ery</HI> of the wicked, are both connected with the <HI>&s;ame word,</HI> and in the <HI>&s;ame &s;entence.</HI> And hence, if <HI>one</HI> is <HI>endle&s;s,</HI> &s;o mu&s;t the <HI>other</HI> be al&s;o."</P>
<P>The an&s;wer is, that "the <HI>bare force</HI> of the word will not &s;upport us, in maintaining an <HI>endle&s;s duration</HI> with re&s;pect, either to the <HI>happine&s;s</HI> of the <HI>righteous</HI> &s;hall be <HI>happy forever.</HI> And why! becau&s;e they are &s;aid, in other texts of &s;cripture, to be <HI>incorruptible, indi&s;&s;oluble, immortal,</HI> not to <HI>die any more,</HI> and the like. But the&s;e terms are no where, in the in&s;pired pages, applied to the <HI>wicked.</HI> On the contrary they are &s;aid to <HI>die the &s;econd death,</HI> which means their &s;uffering the <HI>future torments,</HI> which they may do, and yet be finally &s;aved, as has been proved."</P>
<P>"Another objection, and, in the opinion of &s;ome, the <HI>&s;tronge&s;t</HI> that can be urged, is taken from tho&s;e words of our Saviour in Mark ixth, thrice &s;olemnly repeated,&mdash;WHERE THEIR WORM DIETH NOT, AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED; which words, it is thought, are irreconcilable with the doctrine of <HI>Salvation for all men.</HI>"</P>
<P>In an&s;wer hereto, it is &s;aid by one and another of the before mentioned writers, that "this declaration of our Saviour can prove, in &s;trict argument, no more than that the <HI>torments of the wicked &s;hall la&s;t as long as
<PB N="23" REF="017489_0027_0FA123B2F3F8F268">
their next &s;tate of exi&s;tence la&s;ts,</HI> without determining <HI>how long</HI> that &s;hall be. If their worm preys upon them, without cea&s;ing, <HI>as long as they are in hell,</HI> it is to them, &s;trictly and rigidly &s;peaking, a <HI>worm that does not die.</HI> So if the fire torments them <HI>as long as they exi&s;t in the next &s;tate,</HI> it is to them <HI>a fire which is not quenched,</HI> though their exi&s;tence in that &s;tate may not be <HI>ab&s;o|lutely eternal.</HI>"</P>
<P>"But the mo&s;t plain, ea&s;y and &s;atisfactory an&s;wer is&mdash;that the&s;e words are taken from the book of <HI>I&s;aiah's prophecy,</HI> and allude to the puni&s;hment of tho&s;e, who&s;e bodies were either buried in the valley of Hinnom, or permitted to lie on the ground in the form of <HI>dead car|ea&s;es,</HI> to be fed upon by worms, that delight in putrefac|tion. And con&s;equently, as the <HI>fire</HI> which <HI>burned</HI> the&s;e bodies, and the worms that fed on them, can in no &s;en&s;e be &s;aid <HI>not to be quenched,</HI> and <HI>not to die,</HI> than this, that they continued till the&s;e <HI>carca&s;es were con&s;umed;</HI> &s;o may it be &s;aid of the <HI>worm</HI> that preys on the wicked in <HI>hell,</HI> and of the <HI>fire</HI> that <HI>torments</HI> them, that the <HI>one dieth not,</HI> and the <HI>other is not quenched,</HI> till they have certainly effected the <HI>di&s;&s;olution,</HI> or <HI>death</HI> of wicked men, in the future &s;tate. If any de&s;ire to &s;ee a more full and large account of this text, they may find it in Mr. Jo&s;eph Nicol Scott's di&s;cour&s;e upon the <HI>future torments,</HI> in the 2d Vol. of his Sermons."</P>
<P>"It is objected yet further, that it will greatly tend to encourage wicked men, in their vicious cour&s;es, to be told that the <HI>future torments</HI> will have an <HI>end,</HI> which mu&s;t be the ca&s;e, if <HI>All are finally &s;aved.</HI>"</P>
<P>To this it is an&s;wered, that "<HI>moral depravity</HI> is ab&s;o|lutely incon&s;i&s;tent with <HI>rational happine&s;s:</HI> and that the
<PB N="24" REF="017489_0028_0FA123B3B88E5CF0">
<HI>&s;uffering</HI> of wicked men, in the next &s;tate, will be <HI>exceed|ingly great</HI> in <HI>degree,</HI> as well as <HI>long</HI> in <HI>duration,</HI> in order that they may be made the <HI>willing people of God.</HI> Nor will they be delivered from their <HI>&s;uffering,</HI> till this is effected. And will it not argue folly, as great as can be imagined, for any rather than not <HI>proceed in their vicious cour&s;es,</HI> to chu&s;e to expo&s;e them&s;elves to pain, <HI>unutter|able pain, for a long duration</HI> (God only knows how long) when they might, only by approving them&s;elves faithful &s;ubjects to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, pa&s;s, without &s;uffering this pain, into the joys of the <HI>re&s;urrection &s;tate?</HI> And this folly will de&s;erve the name of <HI>downright madne&s;s,</HI> if it be remembered, they mu&s;t cea&s;e from <HI>being wicked,</HI> before they can po&s;&s;ibly be in&s;tated in <HI>final happine&s;s.</HI> There is no room for debate here. Per&s;ons mu&s;t act in contradiction to all wi&s;dom, in defiance of common &s;en&s;e, who will venture, for the &s;hort lived plea&s;ures of &s;in, to expo&s;e them&s;elves to that <HI>fire</HI> of <HI>hell</HI> which will effect their <HI>death a &s;econd time,</HI> under all the circum&s;tances of <HI>lingering horror</HI> and <HI>tormenting agony:</HI> e&s;pecially if it be con&s;idered they may avoid all this by renouncing their &s;ins, and be admitted to <HI>immortal life and happine&s;s at the re&s;urrection morn.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it may be worthy of con&s;ideration, whether the <HI>common doctrine</HI> is &s;o likely to re&s;train men from &s;in, as <HI>that,</HI> which has been explained and defended, in the foregoing pages. 'Tis undeniably certain, notwith|&s;tanding all that has been &s;aid to make men believe the <HI>torments of hell will have no end,</HI> that they generally <HI>walk in the way of their own heart,</HI> and will not be kept under due re&s;traint. And perhaps, upon examination, it will be found, that one principal rea&s;on of this is, that the <HI>terrrors</HI> propo&s;ed for their per&s;ua&s;ion, <HI>exceed their belief.</HI>
<PB REF="017489_0029_0FA123B475E973E0">
The conceptions they <HI>naturally</HI> form of the ALL MERCIFUL BEING are a counter-balance to their fear of <HI>never-ending mi&s;ery.</HI> Whereas, in the other &s;cheme, there is nothing <HI>incredible,</HI> in the torments of another world. They are perfectly analogous to what is experienced in the <HI>pre&s;ent &s;tate.</HI> And there is no more rea&s;on to object again&s;t them, than the <HI>pre&s;ent judicial proceedings</HI> of heaven again&s;t wicked <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. They are <HI>equally</HI> con&s;i&s;tent with mens natural notions of the <HI>benevolence of God.</HI> And con&s;equently. As pro|po&s;ed in the above &s;cheme, their influence would not be <HI>ob&s;tructed</HI> by their <HI>incredibility:</HI> But they would &s;trike the mind with <HI>full force,</HI> and operate to a much better purpo&s;e, re&s;training men more <HI>effectually</HI> from their <HI>wicked cour&s;es.</HI>"</P>
<P><HI>Finally</HI>&mdash;It is &s;aid, "upon &s;uppo&s;ition of the <HI>truth</HI> of <HI>Univer&s;al Salvation,</HI> it may yet be <HI>improper</HI> and <HI>hurtful</HI> to open it, as a &s;cripture doctrine to the world." To which I have &s;een the proper an&s;wer, in the&s;e words.</P>
<P>"It would be very <HI>extraordinary,</HI> if &s;etting a <HI>&s;crip|ture truth</HI> in its genuine light &s;hould have a dangerous tendency. To &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a thing would reflect di&s;honour upon the <HI>revelation</HI> of God. If <HI>final, uni|ver&s;al happine&s;s</HI> is a <HI>doctrine of the go&s;pel,</HI> we need not fear its injuring mankind, if they were brought <HI>&s;in|cerely</HI> and <HI>univer&s;ally</HI> to believe it. And indeed, all fear of this kind is founded <HI>ultimately</HI> on <HI>man's wi&s;dom,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to the <HI>wi&s;dom of God,</HI> which &s;tands in need of no <HI>human art</HI> or <HI>contrivance,</HI> but can, without it, guard mankind again&s;t wickedne&s;s, and make them good and faithful &s;ubjects, in the kingdom of righteou&s;ne&s;s."</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add, as a conclu&s;ion of the&s;e <HI>extracts,</HI> that, if we &s;hall <HI>All,</HI> before the completion of the &s;cheme
<PB N="26" REF="017489_0030_0FA123B6A7DD8548">
of God, be crowned with <HI>immortality and honour,</HI> what an argument have we for patience, contentment and an entire re&s;ignation to the divine plea&s;ure, under the nu|merous trials of this frail, vain, mortal &s;tate. And how ea&s;ily reconcilable are the <HI>&s;ufferings of the world to come</HI> with the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, as well as ju&s;tice of God? And how ab&s;olutely are all complaints upon this head, &s;ilenced and refuted? For if we are brought into being <HI>expectants</HI> of a <HI>ble&s;&s;ed immortality,</HI> and upon a foundation that will not di&s;appoint us, why then &s;hould we find fault with that <HI>di&s;cipline,</HI> however <HI>&s;evere,</HI> which may, in true rea&s;on, be <HI>morally</HI> connected with <HI>the actual enjoy|ment of it</HI>? We are, upon this plan of things, <HI>infinitely obliged</HI> to God, and ought to <HI>love</HI> and <HI>thank</HI> him for our being, notwith&s;tanding all we may be called to pa&s;s through, before we are received into <HI>his pre&s;ence above,</HI> where is <HI>fulne&s;s of joy forever.</HI></P>
