<P>'TIS not at all improper to add a Treati&s;e of the Day of Grace, to a Di&s;cour&s;e concerning Conver&s;ion. This is the only time wherein he that turns will be accepted: Oh therefore receive not the Grace of God in vain. Though the &s;inner by his iniquity is remo|ved far away from God, the Gulph not|with&s;tanding is not yet fixed. We are ca&s;t out by Nature in a far Country indeed, but this Country is not Hell, though ju&s;t upon the borders of Hell: a return is po&s;&s;i|ble unto our Fathers hou&s;e; and upon our return how joyfully &s;hall we be embraced!</P>
<P>One principal rea&s;on why Time is &s;o ex|ceeding precious, is, becau&s;e it contains the
<PB REF="003114_0003_0FF087098670B268">
Day of Grace. This pre&s;ent time, though &s;o very &s;hort, is of greater value than an whole Eternity hereafter; for then mercy will be out of reach, and Reprobates unal|terably concluded in &s;in, and under the hea|vy load of divine vengeance and indigna|tion. This is the Day of thy gracious vi|&s;itation: Wa&s;te it not away in doing no|thing, or which is wor&s;e, in doing wicked|ly; for there is another Day a coming, which will be a Day of darkne&s;s and of gloomine&s;s, a Day of di&s;tre&s;s and de&s;tructi|on, if Grace and Salvation be neglected.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Luke 19.41, 42.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And when he was come near, he beheld the City, and wept over it, &s;aying, If thou had&s;t known, even thou, at lea&s;t in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE time was now approaching in which our Lord was to make his Soul an offering for &s;in, and to te&s;tifie his love to his Sheep, by laying down his life, to redeem theirs from death, which by going a&s;tray they had de&s;erved. And <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> is ap|pointed the Stage, on which Chri&s;t was to act the greate&s;t part, both of &s;orrow and affection. Well might he cry out, <HI>Behold ye that pa&s;s by; Was ever Grief,</HI> and <HI>Was ever
<PB N="2" REF="003114_0004_0FF086824C02EF98">
Love like Mine?</HI> Unto <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> he comes mo&s;t willingly, though he fore&s;aw the Cro&s;s and &s;hame. The Head was forward to &s;uf|fer him&s;elf, that hereby the &s;ufferings of the Members might be prevented. And accor|ding as it was foretold by the Prophet, his approach is not with outward pomp and &s;plendour; but he is meek and lowly, riding upon an A&s;&s;es Foal. Thus he that thought it not robbery to be equal with God, made him&s;elf of no reputation, and humbled him|&s;elf to this end, that we might be rai&s;ed and exalted.</P>
<P>When he was ju&s;t at the de&s;cent of the Mount of <HI>Olives, the whole multitude of the di&s;ciples began to rejoyce, and to prai&s;e God with a loud voice, for all the mighty works which they had &s;een, v.</HI> 37. They cry <HI>Ho&s;anna to the Son of David, and ble&s;s the King that cometh in the name of the Lord, &s;aying, Peace in heaven and glory in the highe&s;t, v.</HI> 38. Even through the darke&s;t cloud of Chri&s;t's Humiliation, &s;ome beams and rayes of this Sun of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, of this Lord of glory, did break forth. The Phari&s;ees are offended at the Di&s;ciples Acclamations, and <HI>de&s;ire Je&s;us to rebuke them,</HI> v. 39. Unto which unrea&s;onable reque&s;t of theirs he makes this reply, <HI>That if the&s;e &s;hould hold their peace, the &s;tones would immediately cry out, v.</HI> 40. As if he had &s;aid, My Per|&s;on,
<PB N="3" REF="003114_0004_0FF086824C02EF98">
my Doctrine, my Actions, my Won|ders are &s;o evident, that they who are not as &s;tupid as the &s;tones them&s;elves mu&s;t needs be convinced.</P>
<P>At la&s;t he comes within view of <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem,</HI> and the &s;ight of this faithle&s;s, ungrateful and ob&s;tinate City, where &s;o many Pro|phets had been kill'd, and which now it &s;elf was &s;o near to de&s;olation, rai&s;es a &s;orrow in his &s;acred brea&s;t, &s;o that in the mid&s;t of his Di&s;ciples triumph he bur&s;ts out into tears, &s;aying, <HI>If thou had&s;t known; even thou, at lea&s;t in this thy day, the things which belong to thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.</HI></P>
<P>Which words expre&s;s how our Lord was affected towards <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>'s Inhabitants. His commi&s;eration is very great, and 'tis joyned with a kind of exprobration or upbraiding of them: he pities their &s;ad e&s;tate, and up|braids their ignorance, and folly, in not minding the things which would have con|duced to their peace and welfare.</P>
<P>The text may be thus divided.</P>
<P N="1">1. Our Saviour mourns: <HI>When he came near, he beheld, and wept.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Per&s;ons over whom: <HI>The City of Jeru&s;alem.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The cau&s;es why, and they are the&s;e,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They know not, no not they</HI> who had &s;o much means of knowledge, <HI>the things that belonged to their peace.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="4" REF="003114_0005_0FF08680C4B4B258">2. They improved not, but neglected <HI>Their day</HI> of vi&s;itation.</P>
<P N="3">3. This neglect and ignorance of theirs being wilful, was puni&s;hed with a greater degree of blindne&s;s, <HI>Now they are hid from thine eyes,</HI> and that was a judgment mo&s;t de|plorable.</P>
<P>Beloved, I am to &s;peak of the Day of Grace, I wi&s;h you may all know the things which concern your peace, el&s;e <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>'s puni&s;hment may be al&s;o yours; the day may be gone, the lights of the Sanctuary may be put out, and the things of your peace may be hid from your eyes.</P>
<P>I &s;hall illu&s;trate the words of the Text by this en&s;uing Commentary upon them.</P>
<P><HI>And when he was come near, he beheld the City.</HI> The nearne&s;s of a mi&s;erable object does affect the &s;ight and heart: And as with his eyes he &s;aw the City, &s;o by the eyes of Prophe&s;ie he &s;aw the City be&s;ieged, the enemy ca&s;ting a trench about it, and keeping it on every &s;ide; he fore&s;aw how it would be laid even with the ground by <HI>Roman</HI> Armies, and not &s;o much as one &s;tone left upon another.</P>
<P><HI>And he wept over it.</HI> The&s;e tears &s;hewed the truth of his humane nature, and how (iniquity excepted) he was in all things made like unto his brethren. Our Lord
<PB N="5" REF="003114_0005_0FF08680C4B4B258">
could hunger, and groan, and weep, and dye, but &s;in indeed he could not, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.15. It was the de&s;ire of Chri&s;t to execute the Office which his Father had put him in, which was to be a Gatherer and a Saviour of the hou&s;e of <HI>I&s;rael</HI>: But when he percei|ved tho&s;e Sheep transformed into Wolves, ready to devour their own Shepherd, pe|remptorily re&s;olved to peri&s;h, and to refu&s;e the &s;alvation which he brought them; 'tis no wonder if he did not hold his tears.</P>
<P><HI>Saying, If thou had&s;t known, even thou.</HI> There is a mixture of grief and indignation in Chri&s;t, at the ignorance and perver&s;ne&s;s of mi&s;erable <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>; and this made his &s;peech to be abrupt and imperfect. <HI>Calvin</HI> tran&s;lates <HI>O &s;i cognovi&s;&s;es!</HI> Our Lord wi&s;hes that they had known what &s;o highly and nearly concerned them. But 'tis plainly implied that they <HI>knew not</HI>: and this is that of which the Prophet long ago complained, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 1.3. <HI>The Ox knows his owner, and the A&s;s his Ma&s;ters crib, but I&s;rael doth not know, my people do not con&s;ider.</HI> This is very emphatical. As if Chri&s;t &s;hould have &s;aid, O thou <HI>Jeru|&s;alem,</HI> who ha&s;t enjoyed &s;o many means and mercies, and ha&s;t &s;lighted and abu&s;ed them all, notwith&s;tanding all former folly and unkindne&s;s to God, to thy &s;elf, I wi&s;h that <HI>even thou,</HI> would&s;t at la&s;t have open'd thy
<PB N="6" REF="003114_0006_0FF086F803B3E810">
eyes and ears, and become wi&s;e unto thy own &s;alvation.</P>
<P><HI>At lea&s;t in this thy day.</HI> That was a day of &s;pecial vi&s;itation. God who at &s;undry times and in divers manners &s;pake in time pa&s;t unto the Fathers by the Prophets, in that day &s;pake unto them by his Son. And al|though many Me&s;&s;engers and Servants which were &s;ent, had been de&s;pi&s;ed and per&s;ecuted to the death by them, yet at lea&s;t the Son &s;hould have been reverenced. This was <HI>their</HI> day, a time in which they might have been accepted, a day in which &s;alva|tion was brought near to them.</P>
<P><HI>The things which belong unto thy peace!</HI> Peace (according to the Hebrew phra&s;e) does imply all the parts of happine&s;s, the principal whereof does certainly lie in be|ing reconciled to, and enjoying God. But the way of peace and reconciliation, name|ly, Ju&s;tification by faith in Je&s;us, they knew not. An humbled Me&s;&s;iah, who was <HI>to make Mens peace by the blood of his Cro&s;s, Col.</HI> 1.20. they hid their faces from, and e&s;teemed him not: Being puffed up with their own righ|teou&s;ne&s;s and external priviledges and pre|rogatives, they would not &s;ubmit unto the righteou&s;ne&s;s of faith which is revealed in the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="003114_0006_0FF086F803B3E810"><HI>But now they are hid from thy eyes.</HI> Chri&s;t here Sets forth the &s;piritual judgment which they lay under, and likewi&s;e removes the &s;candal and offence which his infirm Di&s;|ciples might be apt to take, becau&s;e <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem</HI> did reject him. They had long refu&s;ed to look unto the Lord, that they might be &s;aved; and now God &s;ends them the &s;pirit of &s;lumber, eyes that they &s;hould not &s;ee, and ears that they &s;hould not hear, and hearts that they &s;hould never under&s;tand. This is a very &s;ore and yet u&s;ual puni&s;h|ment, when Men receive the grace of God in vain, and are re&s;olved to walk contrary to the light which &s;hines about them.</P>
<P>The Text does yield &s;everal points of Doctrine.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t is exceeding full of pity and compa&s;&s;ion.</HI> His weeping here over <HI>Jeru|&s;alem,</HI> &s;hews how kindly affectioned he was towards them, and is towards others in mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>The Lord does grant unto &s;inners a Day of Grace, in which pardon and life are proffer'd to them, and may be obtained by them.</HI> If thou had&s;t known in this thy Day.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>To know in this Day of Grace the things which belong to our peace, is our great happine&s;s and wi&s;dom.</HI> If <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> had been &s;o wi&s;e, her ruine would have been pre|vented.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="003114_0007_0FF086864DEEA680">Fourthly, <HI>When &s;inners will not &s;ee, they are &s;mitten many times with &s;piritual blindne&s;s, and the things of their peace are in a way of judg|ment hid from them.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, <HI>Souls being thus left under darkne&s;s, their &s;tate is wretched and deplorable.</HI> Our Lord with tears laments this &s;ad condition of <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Doct.</HI> 1. The fir&s;t Doctrine is this, <HI>That Je&s;us Chri&s;t is exceeding full of pity and com|pa&s;&s;ion.</HI> The tears which he &s;hed prove this; and if tears will not &s;atisfie, a little af|ter you may behold him &s;hedding of his blood.</P>
<P>This compa&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t extends it &s;elf to them that peri&s;h, as well as unto tho&s;e he &s;aves.</P>
<P>To them that peri&s;h, his compa&s;&s;ion is &s;een in four things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In cau&s;ing the Light whereby he is di&s;co|vered to &s;hine upon them.</HI> 'Tis a mercy that the lo&s;t are told of a Saviour, that they are informed how &s;in hath cau&s;ed their mi&s;ery, and Chri&s;t is &s;ufficient to cure it. <HI>Tender mercy appears, that the Day &s;pring from on high does vi&s;it them that &s;it in darkne&s;s, which can guide their feet into the way of peace, Luke</HI> 1.78, 79. They need not &s;ay, <HI>Who &s;hall a&s;cend into heaven,</HI> to under&s;tand the means of

fallen Mans recovery? <HI>The word is nigh,</HI> which can give a &s;ufficient information. 'Twas the great advantage of the <HI>Jews, that to them were committed the Oracles of God, Rom.</HI> 3.1, 2. But now tho&s;e Oracles are pronounced more fully and plainly; and to enjoy them is the priviledge of &s;uch, as in a Land of light have their lot given them. It was great mercy towards <HI>Capernaum,</HI> that &s;he was lifted up to Heaven, that &s;uch words were &s;poken, that &s;uch works were done in her; and becau&s;e &s;he improved not the mercy, how does our Lord upbraid her?</P>
<P N="2">2. Chri&s;ts compa&s;&s;ion towards them that peri&s;h is &s;een, <HI>in calling and inviting them to come to him:</HI> The Marriage-fea&s;t is prepared, and the &s;ervants are &s;ent into the high|ways, to invite all to come, and partake of it, <HI>Matth.</HI> 22. <HI>Wi&s;dom cryeth without, &s;he ut|tereth her voice in the &s;treets, &s;he cryeth in the chief places of concour&s;e; How long ye &s;imple ones will ye love &s;implicity? and &s;corners delight in &s;corning, and fools hate knowledge? turn ye at my reproof,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.20, 21, 22. And <HI>Prov.</HI> 9.2, 3, 4, 5, 6. we read, <HI>Wi&s;dom hath killed her bea&s;ts, &s;he hath mingled her wine, and furni&s;hed her table, &s;he hath &s;ent forth her mai|dens, &s;he cryeth upon the highe&s;t places of the City; Who&s;o is &s;imple let him turn in hither; as

for him that wanteth under&s;tanding, &s;he &s;aith unto him, come eat of my bread, and drink of my wine which I have mingled; for&s;ake the fooli&s;h and live, and go in the way of under&s;tan|ding.</HI> Thus &s;inners are called after, and though Dogs, yet the &s;ame bread which is prepared for the Children is proffer'd to them; the &s;ame ine&s;timable benefits of Chri&s;t, as pardon, peace, grace, glory, are tendred to them, which believers have ac|cepted of; with the &s;ame eye-&s;alve their eyes &s;hall be anointed, with the &s;ame tried gold they &s;hall be enriched; with the &s;ame white rayment all their nakedne&s;s &s;hall be covered, if they will but come and clo&s;e with Je&s;us.</P>
<P N="3">3. Chri&s;ts compa&s;&s;ion towards them that peri&s;h is &s;een, <HI>in waiting long that be may be gracious</HI>; he knocks at the door, and he <HI>&s;tands</HI> knocking there, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.20. He &s;tands <HI>till his head is filled with dew, and his locks with the drops of the night.</HI> He &s;ees how Sa|tan hath admi&s;&s;ion at his plea&s;ure, and unto <HI>Mammon</HI> at fir&s;t approach the door is &s;et wide open to receive him, but again&s;t Chri&s;t 'tis lock'd and bolted; and yet his love and patience overcomes the&s;e indignities, and he waits &s;till to &s;ee, if at la&s;t &s;inners will con|&s;ult their own good, and entertain him. Chri&s;t by his Spirit &s;trives long, checking

them from &s;in, moving them to duty, de|mon&s;trating the rea&s;onablene&s;s of conver&s;ion and obedience, the danger of continuance in their provocations. Chri&s;t does not go away at the fir&s;t repul&s;e, nor cur&s;e the Fig-tree for the fir&s;t years unfruitfulne&s;s, but he digs about it and dungs it, and expects a great while, before that &s;entence be pro|nounced, <HI>Cut it down, why cumbereth it the ground?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Chri&s;t's compa&s;&s;ion towards them that peri&s;h, is &s;een, <HI>in wi&s;hing, when for their ob&s;ti|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters"> they are given over to them&s;elves, that they would have hearkened and obeyed.</HI> Thus he weeps and wi&s;hes, that <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> had known what they were ignorant of.

P&s;al.</HI> 81.11, 12, 13. Tho&s;e that peri&s;h will have no rea&s;on to complain of Chri&s;t, but of them&s;elves; he wanted not pity, but to them&s;elves they were unmerciful.</P>
<P>But in the &s;econd place; the compa&s;&s;ion of our Lord is manife&s;ted, and that princi|pally to them that are &s;aved; they are cal|led <HI>Ve&s;&s;els of mercy.</HI></P>

of grace is granted, in which they may be accepted, and &s;alvation is brought near them, that they may lay hold upon it.</P>
<P>My work in the handling of this truth will be: Fir&s;t, to &s;hew upon what account the Sea&s;on of Grace is called a Day. Secondly, to declare what are the priviled|ges of this Day of Grace. Thirdly, to lay down the properties of it. Fourthly, I &s;hall give &s;ome rea&s;ons why &s;uch a Day is gran|ted. And then conclude with the Appli|cation.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Upon what account the Sea&s;on of Grace is called a Day.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Sea&s;on of Grace is called a Day, <HI>in regard of the light that then &s;hines.</HI> The Son of Righteou&s;ne&s;s is ri&s;en, and this Day is made by that Suns &s;hining. <HI>Light</HI> from the Go&s;pel <HI>&s;prings up unto them, which</HI> el&s;e would have <HI>&s;at in darkne&s;s, and in the region and &s;hadow of death, Matth.</HI> 4.16. By this, light things are di&s;cover'd which were hid from Ages and Generations. Gods eternal coun&s;el to glorifie his Grace in the pardon, adoption, clean&s;ing and &s;aving of Men that have all &s;inn'd, and thereby come &s;hort of his glory, is by this light made manife&s;t.</P>
<P>The light of Nature is but weak and dim, and cannot make it day; it gives &s;uch a di&s;covery both of God and &s;in, as is &s;uffici|ent
<PB N="21" REF="003114_0013_0FF08714795D93D0">
to leave tho&s;e that &s;in again&s;t God without excu&s;e, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.20. But the way how enemies may be reconciled it cannot &s;hew. Nay, becau&s;e the fir&s;t Covenant ran thus, <HI>Do this and live,</HI> the light of Nature doth &s;trongly incline us to put a confidence in our own works, than which nothing is more contrary to the Go&s;pel of the Grace of God.</P>
<P>But though the Light of Nature be apt to lead out of the way, as well as imperfect, the Light of the Go&s;pel is &s;ufficient. All that are now in glory made u&s;e of this Guide in their pa&s;&s;age through the world. <HI>David, P&s;al.</HI> 19. doth make a compari&s;on between the Light of Nature, and that of the Word: From the Heavens, Firmament, Sun, and Moon, and other Creatures, &s;omething of the Glory of God may be di&s;cover'd: but then after he adds, <HI>The Law of the Lord is perfect</HI>; as if he had &s;aid, From the Word &s;hines forth a greater light, than from the Sun, and Moon, and Stars; a light, which guides infallibly to the Light that's everla&s;t|ing. And this Light is one thing, which makes the Day the text &s;peaks of.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Sea&s;on of Grace is called a Day, <HI>in that it is de&s;ign'd for working.</HI> When the day comes, <HI>though the bea&s;ts gather them&s;elves, and lay them down in their dens, yet Man ari&s;es
<PB N="22" REF="003114_0014_0FF086A0BA0ED6B8">
and goes forth to his work and labour till the evening, P&s;al.</HI> 104.22, 23. In like manner, this day of the Go&s;pel; though they, who are bruti&s;h, lay them down in the bed of ea&s;e, and fall a&s;leep in carnal &s;ecurity, yet &s;uch as have the under&s;tanding of Men, will go forth unto their work and labour; and &s;urely they who have lu&s;ts to mortifie, a world to overcome, a devil to re&s;i&s;t, and &s;ouls to &s;ave, have work enough to do. <HI>Why &s;tand ye here all the day idle?</HI> (&s;ays our Lord in the Parable) <HI>Matth.</HI> 20.6. Spiritual &s;loth is now un&s;ea&s;onable and unrea&s;onable. Now is the time, and the only time, for working; <HI>Whatever therefore our hand finds to do, we &s;hould do it with our whole might.</HI> The Painter gave a good rea&s;on, why in his Piece he was &s;o accurate, <HI>In Immortalitatem pingo,</HI> I paint for Immortality; intimating, that the picture he made, was to continue in view after he was dead and gone: So we &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>In Aeternitatem operamur,</HI> Our days work is for Eternity, therefore we dare not trifle. The Church is likened unto a Vineyard, and every one &s;hould be a la|bourer.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Sea&s;on of Grace is called a Day, <HI>in regard of the brevity and &s;hortne&s;s of its conti|nuance</HI>; It cannot exceed the term of natural life, and how &s;hort that is experience &s;hews,
<PB N="23" REF="003114_0014_0FF086A0BA0ED6B8">
and the Scripture to affect us, doth expre&s;s by &s;everal notable &s;imilitudes: Says the A|po&s;tle, <HI>What is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little while, and then vani&s;h|eth away,</HI> Jam. 4.14. And <HI>Job</HI> 9.25, 26. <HI>Now my days are &s;wifter than a po&s;t, they flee away; and &s;ee no good; they are pa&s;&s;ed away as the &s;hips of de&s;ire, as the Eagle that ha&s;teth to the prey.</HI> How fa&s;t doth the Po&s;t ride? how &s;wiftly doth the Ship &s;ail? what ha&s;te doth the hungry Eagle make to the prey? Such &s;peed, O Man, O Woman, thou art making towards another world. The Day of Grace &s;hortens as thy life &s;hortens; re|flect upon the opportunities thou ha&s;t lo&s;t with grief, condemn thy folly, and be &s;o wife as now to redeem time, by doubled care and diligence.</P>
<P>And as this Day of Grace cannot exceed the bounds of life, &s;o it may come to a pe|riod before. Long re&s;i&s;ting of the Spirit, and &s;tanding out again&s;t the means of Grace, the Lord may, and often doth pu|ni&s;h, by re&s;olving, his Spirit &s;hall &s;trive no longer, and that to the working of Grace, the means &s;hall never be made effectual: The accepted time is not an <HI>Age,</HI> but a <HI>Day,</HI> and much of this day is gone already. Now as the Traveller being &s;traitned, as to time, makes the greater &s;peed, &s;o &s;hould we
<PB N="24" REF="003114_0015_0FF086D40E9C3FE8">
in our Chri&s;tian race; we &s;hould lay a&s;ide the clogs of the world, and the <HI>weights of &s;in, that we may run with</HI> the greater freedom and <HI>patience, Heb</HI> 12.1.</P>
<P>We may ob&s;erve great difference in the days of the year; very long they are in the mid&s;t of Summer, in compari&s;on with what they are in the depth of Winter. And verily &s;uch an inequality there is between the day of grace, which &s;ome have, and which o|thers do enjoy. And what knowe&s;t thou, O &s;ecure &s;oul, who reckone&s;t upon a long &s;ea&s;on yet to come, but that thy day of grace may prove as it were a Winters day, having not half &s;o many hours, as to others are allotted! Rouze up thy &s;elf therefore, and loo&s;e no more of that time which is &s;o exceeding &s;hort at longe&s;t, and may be &s;o much &s;horter than thou imagine&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Sea&s;on of Grace is called a Day, <HI>with relation to the night that is coming</HI>; and when the night is come, thy main work cannot be done, if then it be undone; and if it be undone, thou thy &s;elf art undone for ever. <HI>I mu&s;t work the work of him that &s;ent me while it is day</HI> (&s;ays Chri&s;t) <HI>the night com|eth, when no Man can work, John</HI> 9.4. When the day of the righteous concludes, they re&s;t from their labour, and their works fol|low them; and though the night of death

over&s;preads their earthly tabernacle, yet their &s;pirits are made perfect, and 'tis an everla&s;ting day of glory with them. And on the other &s;ide, when the day of the wicked comes to a period, either they are left under invincible blindne&s;s, and dead|ne&s;s, and obduration; and how can they work then, unle&s;s the works of darkne&s;s? or el&s;e death fini&s;hes both the day of life and grace together, and then 'twill be too late to think of working, for they will be bound hand and foot, and thrown into outer dark|ne&s;s. When you hear of a day of grace, withal remember, that the night and dark|ne&s;s are ha&s;tning; and if &s;o, for you to de|lay that great bu&s;ine&s;s, for which this day is afforded, &s;hews the wor&s;t and mo&s;t perni|cious imprudence. Let me &s;peak to you in the words of our Lord, John 12 35. <HI>Yet a little while is the light with you; walk while ye have the light, le&s;t darkne&s;s come upon you; for he that walketh in darkne&s;s knoweth not whither he goeth.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, I am to declare the priviledges of the Day of Grace. The&s;e are priviledges of ine&s;timable value: the lo&s;s of the&s;e, and of the hopes that ever they will be again enjoyed, is one thing which makes Hell &s;o &s;ad a place. A time of trade and thriving in the world, a time
<PB N="26" REF="003114_0016_0FF086AFE2A7BFF8">
of peace, and plenty, and outward pro&s;pe|rity, though to be pray'd for and prized, yet it is nothing near &s;o much to be prized as <HI>the accepted time,</HI> as <HI>the day of &s;alvation.</HI></P>
<P>The priviledges of the Day of Grace are the&s;e following.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>One is the enjoyment of the Word of God.</HI> Becau&s;e of this <HI>I&s;rael</HI> of old was look'd upon as priviledg'd above the whole earth be&s;ides, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 147.10, 20. <HI>He &s;heweth his Word unto Jacob, his Statutes and his Judgments to the Children of I&s;rael; he hath not dealt &s;o with any nation; and as for his Judgments they have not known them.</HI> The Saints in Scripture, who&s;e eyes were more fully open, and who&s;e judgments were more clear, to appre|hend the worth of things, what an e&s;timate do they put upon the Word of God!

will be at peace with you, &s;o they u&s;e many Arguments to work upon your con&s;ciences and affections; they will not let you alone in your vanity, but Sabbath after Sabbath cry to you, and tell you, that when you ru&s;h into &s;in you ru&s;h into a battel, and 'tis again&s;t that great God, who mu&s;t needs be too hard for you: Who ever fought with him, and got any thing but blows, wounds and death? <HI>Who ever hardned him&s;elf again&s;t him and pro&s;pered? Job</HI> 9.4. They are ever commending Je&s;us Chri&s;t to you, and de|claring how able, and how willing he is to &s;ave you, and how certain you are to be damn'd without him. And is it not a pri|viledge to be thus importuned for your own good? to have ble&s;&s;edne&s;s and life in a manner obtruded and forc'd upon you? Now Me&s;&s;engers of Peace are &s;ent in this Day of Grace; now glad tidings are brought, that God is willing to be reconciled; but when once you come to the Region of darkne&s;s below, &s;uch tidings will never come to your ears more.</P>
<P>The greatne&s;s of this priviledge, to enjoy the Word, will further appear, if the admi|rable effects of the Word of God are duly con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="31" REF="003114_0018_0FF0871794320370">1. <HI>The Word of God doth make the &s;imple wi&s;e,</HI> P&s;al. 119.130. <HI>The entrance of thy words giveth light, it giveth under&s;tanding to the &s;imple.</HI> Tho&s;e, whom Satan before be|fool'd, putting them off with husks in&s;tead of what is &s;olid and &s;atisfying, are by the Word made too wi&s;e for this &s;ubtle Serpent: Now they are undeceived, and perceive how little fruit they have had of their evil works, therefore they are a&s;hamed of them, and of their own folly, in giving way to them. The Word di&s;covers the pearl of price to them, and makes them wi&s;e Mer|chants, they &s;ell all to purcha&s;e it: This wi&s;dom which the Word infu&s;es, <HI>is not of this world, nor of the Princes of this world, which come to nought,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.6. The great ones of the earth may be prudent, in chu&s;ing and ordering the means, for the attaining of the end which they aim at, but in the choice of their end, they di&s;cover the greate&s;t &s;im|plicity. All that greatne&s;s and glory, which they de&s;ign, and them&s;elves al&s;o, will come to nought; Death will certainly and &s;pee|dily contract all their honour and power, and cover it with tho&s;e two words, <HI>Hic jacet,</HI> Here it all lies buried. But the wi&s;dom, which the Word imparts, makes us to look higher, <HI>at a better and more enduring &s;ub&s;tance, at an inheritance which never fades away:</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="003114_0019_0FF086B851F57920">
And the word &s;hews, how by &s;anctification we may be prepared for that inheritance; and tho&s;e who are made meet to be &s;o, &s;hall at length be made partakers of it. While the Day of Grace la&s;teth, thou may&s;t be made wi&s;e to &s;alvation; but if this be not improved, <HI>in the greatne&s;s of thy folly thou &s;halt go a&s;tray, and dye without in&s;truction,</HI> Prov. 5.23.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Thou Word doth rai&s;e the dead to life.</HI> That Voice, <HI>Ari&s;e ye dead and come to Je&s;us,</HI> mu&s;t needs be powerful, &s;ince upon it follows the fir&s;t Re&s;urrection; <HI>John</HI> 5.25. <HI>Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead &s;hall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear &s;hall live.</HI> At the hearing of this Word of God, the Con&s;cience, which was before &s;tupid, is &s;tartled; the heart, that was all of &s;tone, becomes a heart of fle&s;h, it is tender and &s;en&s;ible, it feels the weight of &s;in and of the cur&s;e, and longs to be freed from both, though before it matter'd neither. A new principle of grace is put into the Soul, whereby it is inclined towards God, and acts for him. The Lord is breathed after, and there is a de&s;ire to plea&s;e him now, as there was formerly to plea&s;e the Fle&s;h, by fulfilling the Lu&s;ts of it. O di&s;mal &s;tate to lie dead in &s;in! to be

&s;en&s;ele&s;s and unconcern'd under &s;uch a load! But that's a life indeed, to be alive to God. And while this Day of &s;alvation continues, thou may&s;t be que&s;tioned; but if this be lo&s;t, the &s;econd death will be thy portion, and then Life will be eternally far from thee.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>This Word doth clean&s;e tho&s;e defilements, which nothing in the world can do away. The Word of God</HI> is compared to <HI>fire,</HI> and to an <HI>hammer; as an hammer</HI> it breaks the rocky heart, and then as <HI>fire</HI> it melts the heart, and from its dro&s;s doth purifie it: <HI>Joh.</HI> 15.3. <HI>Now are ye clean, through the Word which I have &s;poken to you.</HI> In the <HI>Word,</HI> as in a <HI>Gla&s;s,</HI> we may behold the abominable filthine&s;s, and vile ingratitude, that is in &s;in; and al&s;o the <HI>beauty of holine&s;s</HI> is pre&s;ented to our eye; no wonder then, if the former be abhorr'd, the latter de&s;ired. Be&s;ides, the Word holds forth a Promi&s;e from the Lord him&s;elf, <HI>to make the &s;inner clean,</HI> and that <HI>from all filthi|ne&s;s both of the fle&s;h and &s;pirit, Ezek.</HI> 36.25. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.1. The Day of Grace is a day of healing; now thou may&s;t be purged and cured of thy &s;piritual plagues; but if this &s;ea&s;on be neglected, thou wilt dye of them.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>This Word doth afford &s;uch peace and joy, as the creatures cannot yield.</HI> Corn, and Wine, and Oyl, cannot yield &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">e comfort.

Hark to <HI>David, P&s;al.</HI> 119.111. <HI>Thy te&s;timo|nies have I taken as an heritage for ever, for they are the rejoycing of my heart.</HI> In &s;en&s;ual mirth the heart is &s;ad, mi&s;gives, and is un&s;atisfied; but the Word makes the very heart joyful. In the Word, we may &s;ee at pre&s;ent the reconciled face of God, the frowns and other &s;igns of anger gone, and it &s;peaks plainly of fuller manife&s;tations, and infinite|ly greater plea&s;ures, which are re&s;erved for hereafter, and the lively hopes of the&s;e, which are &s;o near, as well as &s;ure and glo|rious, may well make the heart to leap for joy.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>This Word is able to build up tho&s;e who are converted, and to bring them &s;afe unto their Country:</HI> 'Tis a means to increa&s;e the grace, which 'tis a means to work: As it is <HI>the in|corruptible &s;eed,</HI> whereby we are regenerated and begotten again, &s;o it is <HI>the milk</HI> where|with we grow and thrive in holine&s;s. <HI>Act.</HI> 20.32. <HI>I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them that are &s;anctified.</HI> I might add, That even tho&s;e whom the Word doth not &s;avingly change, yet it prevails upon many times a great way, it brings them near to the Kingdom, and 'tis their own fault that they mi&s;s of it.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="003114_0020_0FF087191F849698">And &s;eeing the Word of God hath &s;uch effects, that the enjoyment of it is a great priviledge, is without controver&s;ie.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another priviledge of the Day of Grace, <HI>is the pre&s;ence of the Spirit.</HI> The Word, and all other Ordinances, without the Spirit, are but like the carca&s;s without the &s;oul. He makes the <HI>Word quick and pow|erful, and &s;harper than a two-edged Sword,</HI> which al&s;o would be found but a dead and inefficacious Letter. 'Tis ob&s;erved concer|ning the hotter Climates, that when the Sun is up, and begins to &s;hine, and &s;corch more vehemently, there is al&s;o a Wind ari&s;es to fan and cool the dwellers there, el&s;e tho&s;e Regions would be uninhabitable. In like manner, where the Sun of the Go&s;pel &s;hines, there is the Wind of the Spirit; and the&s;e his gales, how refre&s;hing, how power|ful are they? The acce&s;&s;es of the Spirit are much to be ob&s;erved and e&s;teemed; with|out his concurrence, no advantage will be reaped by all the means of grace we u&s;e.</P>
<P>If the &s;everal operations of the Spirit are con&s;ider'd, 'twill be very evident what a priviledge of the Day of Grace this is, to en|joy his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>'Tis the work of the Spirit to convince.</HI> Though the &s;ecure ones of the world had rather be let alone to &s;leep on and cannot
<PB N="36" REF="003114_0021_0FF0870785E12850">
endure to be jogged by conviction; yet the&s;e convictions are great mercies. What the Spirit doth convince the world of, our Lord informs us, <HI>John</HI> 16.8. <HI>And when he is come, he will reprove or convince the world of &s;in, of righteou&s;ne&s;s and of judgment: of &s;in, becau&s;e they believe not on me; of righteou&s;ne&s;s, becau&s;e I go to the Father, and ye &s;ee me no more; of judgment, becau&s;e the Prince of this world is judged.</HI> The Spirit convinces Men of <HI>&s;in</HI>; he &s;hews the evil in it, and the dan|ger of it, and among other &s;ins, that grand one of unbelief, that is to &s;ay, their rejecting Chri&s;t &s;o long, and &s;lighting and refu&s;ing the remedy he proffers, is in a &s;pecial man|ner &s;et home upon their hearts to their affliction and humbling. He convinces likewi&s;e of <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> as well as of &s;in. He di&s;covers the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, where|by all &s;in may be covered; and this righte|ou&s;ne&s;s appears to be compleat and accep|ted, becau&s;e Chri&s;t is gone to his Father. Chri&s;t undertook by his &s;ufferings to &s;atisfie for our offences; and if the &s;atisfaction had not been full, he would never have been rid of the Cur&s;e, which, &s;in being imputed to him, was laid upon him; neither would his righteous Father have &s;uffered him to have &s;it down in the Throne with him. But now &s;ince he is gone to his Father, and
<PB N="37" REF="003114_0021_0FF0870785E12850">
&s;et down in the Throne, we may conclude, he hath paid the utmo&s;t farthing of our debt; and through him the Father is ready to &s;hew grace and favour to us. And if the conviction and &s;ight of &s;in ca&s;t down, the di&s;covery of this righteou&s;ne&s;s may again revive. 'Tis a happine&s;s to &s;ee our &s;cores, &s;ince we are &s;hew'd a way how to have them all cro&s;s'd; were it not for the &s;ight of the one, we &s;hould never mind the other.</P>
<P>Again, the Spirit doth convince of <HI>Judg|ment.</HI> By <HI>Judgment</HI> we may under&s;tand, the condemnation of the impenitent and unbelieving, who, though they are convin|ced of &s;in, continue in &s;in; and though Chri&s;t be proffer'd, &s;till refu&s;e to embrace him. <HI>The Prince of this world is judged,</HI> and condemned; and &s;hall the&s;e, who &s;in again&s;t a remedy (which the Devil never did) e&s;cape? No certainly, <HI>God, who &s;pared not the Angels which &s;inned, but ca&s;t them down to hell, knows how to re&s;erve the unju&s;t unto the day of judgment to be puni&s;hed,</HI> 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.4, 9. Or el&s;e by <HI>Judgment</HI> we may under&s;tand, the Government and Kingdom of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <HI>All power is given to him,</HI> and <HI>Judgment com|mitted into his hand. Satan, the Prince of this world, is already ca&s;t out</HI> and overcome. And if he <HI>hath &s;poiled principalities and powers,</HI> certainly <HI>all his foes will be made his foot &s;tool.</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="003114_0022_0FF086C55BC91D08">
Well then, it highly concerns all to &s;ubmit unto the Scepter of Chri&s;t, &s;ince el&s;e they will be da&s;h'd in pieces by him. And in this Day of Grace, Chri&s;t is ready to pa&s;s by former rebellions, if you now will be|come obedient to him.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>'Tis the work of the Spirit to renew.</HI> 'Tis a difficult matter to charge an heart that is &s;o unconceivably wicked as Mans is; and yet the Spirit doth effect this change; he &s;hews his mighty power, in cau&s;ing a vehe|ment love to be turned into a perfect hatred. Sin, which was lov'd better than the &s;oul, better than &s;alvation, the heart by the Spi|rit is turn'd again&s;t it, and how earne&s;t are the cries that it may not reign, no, nor live any longer! And Holine&s;s, again&s;t which there was a very &s;trong, though unrea&s;ona|ble antipathy, is now hungred and thir&s;ted after; there is a tide which runs upwards, contrary to the former &s;tream which ran downward. The Lord hath tho&s;e affecti|ons, which before &s;in and the world com|manded. <HI>The de&s;art is become as Sharon,</HI> and in the ruines which corruption hath made, there is a Temple for the Spirit of God to dwell in. The Day of Grace is the only time to be made new creatures in. Now thy earthly heart will be made heavenly, thy impure heart clean&s;ed, thy mind, which
<PB N="39" REF="003114_0022_0FF086C55BC91D08">
was vain, carnal, enmity again&s;t God, may be made &s;erious, and to approve, and &s;ubject it &s;elf to the Law of God.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>'Tis the work of the Spirit to guide&punc;</HI> They who are the children of God, are led by him, and 'tis <HI>in the way everla&s;ting that he leads them</HI>; they are directed into &s;uch a path, as will certainly bring them to the everla&s;ting enjoyment of the Eternal God. Neither doth he only guide, but &s;trengthen; the Spirit puts might into their inner man, and makes them to hold on their way, till they come to the ble&s;&s;ed end of it. <HI>We have all like &s;heep gone a&s;tray, we have turned every one to his own way, I&s;a.</HI> 53 6. But in this Day of Grace, the Spirit is near, to chalk out a path, in which we cannot mi&s;s of happine&s;s, and to help us over all the &s;tum|bling blocks, and difficulties, which are ca&s;t in our way. The Spirit doth al&s;o comfort as well as &s;trengthen: He &s;heds abroad the &s;en&s;e of the love of God into the heart; and &s;uch a joy i&s;&s;ues from this &s;en&s;e of love, that tribulation cannot turn into &s;orrow.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Many of them that peri&s;h, have experience, while this Day of Grace continues, of the Spirits workings.</HI> The Spirit doth u&s;e a kind of holy violence, to hinder them from pulling down vengeance upon them&s;elves. Thus he did &s;trive with the old world in the day
<PB N="40" REF="003114_0023_0FF0871BB9916188">
of their vi&s;itation. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.18, 19, 20. <HI>Chri&s;t was quickned by the Spirit, by which al&s;o he went and preached unto the &s;pirits in pri&s;on, which &s;ometime were di&s;obedient, when once the long &s;uffering of God waited in the days of Noah.</HI> This place is wre&s;ted, and may &s;eem diffi|cult, but the meaning is plainly this, That Chri&s;t was rai&s;ed from the dead by the power of the Holy Gho&s;t, by which Holy Gho&s;t, accompanying the mini&s;try of the ancient Patriarchs, he preached unto the impenitent &s;inners of the old world, who&s;e &s;pirits are now impri&s;oned in hell, becau&s;e in their life time they were di&s;obedient to the Spirits voice, all the while the long &s;uf|fering of God did wait upon them. Thus the Spirit likewi&s;e did &s;trive with the chil|dren of <HI>I&s;rael, but they rebelled, and vexed the holy Spirit of God, I&s;a.</HI> 63.10. 'Tis not an unu&s;ual thing, for the Spirit to enlighten and awaken the Con&s;cience, to clap chains and fetters upon corruption, for a while, that it breaks not forth as formerly, to con|&s;train unto a frequent performance of duty. But the Soul hankers after its beloved lu&s;ts and vanities, grows weary of the Spirits re&s;traint, grudges the time and pains which duty takes up, and wi&s;hes that the Spirit would go away, and accordingly the Holy Gho&s;t departs from him. However this is
<PB N="41" REF="003114_0023_0FF0871BB9916188">
true, that the Spirit works much, and would more, were he not re&s;i&s;ted. That's the &s;e|cond priviledge of the Day of Grace, the pre&s;ence of the Spirit.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another priviledge of the Day of Grace, <HI>is liberty to come to the Throne of Grace.</HI> All fle&s;h is now invited to the Hearer of Prayers, and their prayers &s;hall be regarded, if they no longer regard iniquity.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Lord now is near, and may be found, I&s;a.</HI> 55.6. His merciful nature inclines him to come to the help of them that need it. As he is near to give them that grace which they cry for, &s;o to give them grace to cry after a right manner. We cannot &s;o much as come that we may be help'd, unle&s;s we are help'd to come. The Lord is within hearing of all that call; who ever &s;ought him &s;eriou&s;ly and &s;ought in vain? He is &s;o near as to hear our very wi&s;per'd &s;upplica|tions, and to take notice of the inward groanings of our &s;pirits, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 38.9. <HI>Lord, all my de&s;ire is before thee, and my groaning is not hid from thee.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;ome may object, <HI>Doth not the Scrip|ture &s;ay, that the Lord and his &s;alvation are far from the wicked? and therefore wicked ones have no encouragement to come to him.</HI></P>
<P>Well, But if the wicked Man doth cry, that he may be renewed, and that his wick|edne&s;s,
<PB N="42" REF="003114_0024_0FF0871E445A6140">
both as to the guilt and practi&s;e, may be put far away from him, then the Lord will draw near immediately.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>God is not only in this day of grace willing to be found, but he &s;eeks after us</HI> John 4.23. <HI>The true wor&s;hippers &s;hall wor&s;hip the Father in &s;pirit and truth, for the Father &s;eeketh &s;uch to wor&s;hip him.</HI> Fervent prayer is delightful mu&s;ick in his ears, <HI>Cant.</HI> 2 14 <HI>O my Dove, that art in the clefts of the rocks, in the &s;ecret places of the &s;tairs; let me &s;ee thy countenance, let me hear thy voice, for &s;weet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.</HI> The Lord is plea&s;ed to &s;ee us gather about him, and to hear us cry for this, and that, and the other mercy, &s;ince his mercies are &s;o great a multitude, that he hath enough and enough for all. Nay, the Lord him&s;elf doth &s;eek to us, and <HI>be&s;eech us to be reconciled,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.20. And if he intreat us to accept of mercy, &s;hall not we &s;peed in our intreaties for the obtaining of it?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The promi&s;e which God hath made may now be pleaded.</HI> This is the time to lay hold up|on his Covenant. <HI>Lord! thou ha&s;t promi&s;ed to blot out iniquity as a cloud; Oh when &s;hall this cloud be &s;catter'd, that I may walk in the light of thy countenance!

<P>The wor&s;t of Men, <HI>the chief of &s;inners,</HI> may urge the promi&s;e of a new heart, and of wa&s;hing from filthine&s;s, as long as <HI>they &s;eek unto the God of I&s;rael to do this for them, Ezek.</HI> 36.37. and are &s;o far wrought upon, as to de&s;ire to be &s;anctified; the whole Co|venant &s;hall be made good to them, if their unbelief of God's power and truth be not an hinderance.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Now in this Day of Grace the great High-prie&s;t &s;tands ready to intercede for us.</HI> Never any &s;incerely begg'd for pardon and for grace, but Chri&s;t pray'd that Prayer over again, and a gracious return was made to it. The Spirit al&s;o is ready to help infir|mities, to fill our hearts with &s;uch de&s;ires as &s;hall be &s;urely &s;atisfied; and truly we have to do with a God, who of the be&s;t things, which are mo&s;t needful, mo&s;t de&s;ireable, is always mo&s;t liberal.

<P N="4">4. Another priviledge of the Day of Grace is this, <HI>That now the way is open to the Kingdom.</HI> As you may come to the Throne of Grace, &s;o 'tis po&s;&s;ible to get into the Throne of Glory, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.21. <HI>To him that overcometh will I grant to &s;it with me in my Throne, even as I overcame, and am &s;et down with my Father in his Throne.</HI> Our Lord doth &s;tand, as it were, with a Crown of Life in his hand, and &s;ays, <HI>Believe in me, and conti|nue faithful to the death, and this Crown &s;hall be put upon your heads.</HI> The Kingdom is of|fered, and the &s;ure way to the Kingdom is revealed. <HI>Life and Immortality are brought to light by the Go&s;pel,</HI> that is, &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ed and glorious life, as will never by death have a period; and if you <HI>cea&s;e to do evil, learn to do well, and patiently continue in well-doing,</HI> this eternal life &s;hall a&s;&s;uredly be given you.</P>
<P>The fooli&s;h Virgins had a Day of Grace as well as the wi&s;e: The Bridegroom came, and the door was open; if they had been ready, they might have entred; but having lo&s;t the opportunity, they knocked at la&s;t, but it was too late, the door was &s;hut, and
<PB N="45" REF="003114_0025_0FF0873F93AA9778">
they were &s;ent away with, <HI>I know you not,</HI> Mat. 25. We read of <HI>a Ladder that reached from earth to heaven</HI>; now there is a po&s;&s;ibi|lity of climbing up thither: But there is no Ladder that reaches from hell to heaven: If this pre&s;ent day of &s;alvation be lo&s;t, &s;al|vation it &s;elf al&s;o will be lo&s;t for ever.</P>
<P N="5">5. Another priviledge of the Day of Grace is this, <HI>That during this &s;ea&s;on the &s;tate of the wicked is not unalterable.</HI> 'Tis true, the Holy Gho&s;t expre&s;ly &s;ays, that impenitent and unbelieving ones are <HI>condemn'd already, John</HI> 3.18. Sentence of condemnation is pa&s;t, but it may be repealed, if they at la&s;t are brought to mourn for their rejecting of a Saviour, and with their hearts <HI>believe in the Name of the only begotten Son of God</HI>; the con|&s;equent of this faith will be freedom from condemnation, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.1. <HI>There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who walk not after the fle&s;h, but after the &s;pirit.</HI> There was condemnation hereto|fore to them as well as to others, but now there is none, for they are in Chri&s;t, and &s;hew it, by renouncing the lu&s;ts and works of the fle&s;h, and giving them&s;elves up to the Spirits guidance.</P>
<P>They whom &s;in hath &s;et at a great di&s;|tance from Chri&s;t, are called to come to him; and while this Day of Grace la&s;ts,
<PB N="46" REF="003114_0026_0FF087219E5EDF30">
that word holds good, <HI>I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out.</HI> But when this day is done, then 'twill be, <HI>I will in no wi&s;e receive.</HI> The Lamb him&s;elf then will be full of wrath, and that's dread|ful. The Lamb can pacifie the anger of God, but who can appea&s;e the Lambs an|ger? When the only Reconciler is him&s;elf irreconcileable; when the only Interce&s;&s;or is inexorable; when the only Saviour pu|ni&s;heth with everla&s;ting de&s;truction, what hope of help remains then?</P>
<P>But as yet 'tis po&s;&s;ible for Rebels to ob|tain a pardon, and to be made children. Though thou ha&s;t &s;inn'd thy &s;elf near to hell, yet thou ha&s;t not &s;inn'd thy &s;elf into hell. Though &s;in hath abounded, if thou art brought by the entring of the Law, to a &s;ence how thy offences have abounded, <HI>Grace will much more abound, Rom.</HI> 5.20. The Lord hath turn'd and chang'd as bad as the wor&s;t of you, and that which hath been done may be done again, &s;ince his hand is as mighty to &s;ave, and his Grace as free as ever.</P>
<P>I have done with the priviledges of this Day of Grace. In the third place follow the properties of it, which are the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>This Day of Grace is uncertain, as to its duration,</HI> 'tis more uncertain than the day of life, for that may end before this doth:
<PB N="47" REF="003114_0026_0FF087219E5EDF30">
Nay, the Day of Grace may be pa&s;t, while the very means of Grace continue. The acceptable time was pa&s;s'd with the <HI>Jews,</HI> when the Prophet was &s;ent to preach among them. Hark what a &s;ad Commi&s;&s;ion he had, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 6.9, 10. <HI>Go make the heart of this people fat, make their ears heavy, and &s;hut their eyes, le&s;t they &s;ee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and under&s;tand with their hearts, and convert, and be healed.</HI> 'Tis dreadful when the Word &s;hall make the ear more deaf, and the Light the eye more blind, and awaken|ing means the heart more gro&s;s and &s;tupid.</P>
<P>The Sons of <HI>Eli</HI> had out&s;tood their day, and yet after this their Father admoni&s;hes them, and endeavours to reclaim them. They were la&s;civious, and <HI>made them&s;elves vile</HI>; and <HI>Eli</HI> &s;aid, <HI>'Tis no good report I hear of you, my &s;ons, ye make the Lords people to tran&s;|gre&s;s: If one man &s;in again&s;t another, the Judge &s;hall judge him; but if a man &s;in again&s;t the Lord, who &s;hall intreat for him? Notwith&s;tan|ding they hearkened not unto the voice of their Father, becau&s;e the Lord would &s;lay them.</HI> When Drunkards, Sorcerers, Liars, Whoremon|gers, Worldlings, are reproved often, and will not hearken, who knows but the &s;ea&s;on of mercy may be ended, and the Lord in|tends to &s;lay them, to damn them: And if at the hearing of this they are unconcern'd,
<PB N="48" REF="003114_0027_0FF086D281A87FE0">
there is greater cau&s;e to fear (though we cannot ab&s;olutely conclude) that 'tis &s;o in|deed.</P>
<P>The day of grace is uncertain: the means of grace may be before you are aware re|moved. The golden Candle&s;tick doth not &s;tand &s;o fa&s;t in any place, as that 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be took away. Tremble at that threatning uttered to the Church of <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> Rev. 2.5. <HI>I will come unto thee quick|ly, and remove thy candle&s;tick out of his place, except thou repent.</HI> And although Ordinan|ces remain, a ble&s;&s;ing may be withheld from them. Thou do&s;t not know but every call may be the la&s;t time of asking, and Chri&s;t may for ever after hold his peace; and therefore pre&s;ently give con&s;ent to be e&s;pou|&s;ed to him; thou do&s;t not know, but that every motion of the Spirit may have his la&s;t &s;triving with thee, and if thou &s;till re&s;i&s;te&s;t, the Spirit may take his leave, and &s;ay, <HI>Fooli&s;h Soul, go on in &s;in, go on to hell, I will not &s;trive any more to hinder thee.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>This Day of Grace is exceeding precious</HI>: This is the very flower and cream of time. What's the rea&s;on the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> begs, the Lord would <HI>teach him to number his days aright? P&s;al.</HI> 90.12. What's the rea&s;on one Apo&s;tle exhorts, <HI>See then that ye walk circum&s;pectly, not as fools, but as wi&s;e, redeeming the time?</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="003114_0027_0FF086D281A87FE0">
Eph. 5.15, 16. and another advi&s;es, <HI>Pa&s;s the time of your &s;ojourning here in fear,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.17. Surely the&s;e holy Men &s;aw more in time, than mo&s;t in the world are aware of; they were &s;en&s;ible, the pre&s;ent time contains the Day of Grace; and that eternal Glory mu&s;t now be got, or lo&s;t for ever. If there were no hope at all of being reconciled unto God, of obtaining mercy, and finding grace, ala&s;s our time would be of no value! But we may without prejudice to truth affirm, that time is more precious than gold; for now only Chri&s;t, who is &s;o precious, is to be received; now only the Soul, which is &s;o precious, is to be &s;ecured.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle calls this the <HI>accepted time, and the day of &s;alvation:</HI> If now we come the Lord will accept us, and give his Son, him&s;elf, and freely all things to us&punc; and Salvation, which &s;ince we are lo&s;t we &s;o much need, &s;hall not be denied. This Sal|vation is called, <HI>Salvation of the Soul, Heb.</HI> 10.39. The better part, the Jewel which the De&s;troyer principally aims at, and de|&s;igns to make his prey, is &s;ecured. This &s;alvation al&s;o is affirmed to be <HI>great, everla&s;|ting, and &s;alvation to the uttermo&s;t.</HI> From the greate&s;t evils the heirs of &s;alvation are deli|vered, everla&s;tingly delivered, and that good work which is begun in them, &s;hall be per|fected
<PB N="50" REF="003114_0028_0FF087234D507668">
to the uttermo&s;t, and all of them &s;hall &s;tand in Glory, as &s;o many Monuments of Power, and Mercy, and Grace, unto Eter|nity. And is not the Day of Grace preci|ous, &s;ince a day of &s;uch &s;alvation?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>This Day of Grace is a Day of Power,</HI> P&s;al. 110.3. <HI>Thy people &s;hall be willing in the day of thy power.</HI> The Arm of the Lord is now revealed, in making the report of the Go&s;pel to be believed; the &s;ame power is exerted in rai&s;ing a &s;inner to the life of faith, that was &s;hewn in rai&s;ing up Je&s;us our Lord from the dead. Strong holds are pull'd down, rea&s;onings again&s;t Religion, as if it were either ab&s;urd, or intollerably burthen|&s;ome, are &s;ilenced. Tho&s;e lu&s;ts, which be|fore bare all the &s;way, have a deadly wound, which &s;hall not be healed again. Sins do|minion is overthrown, and the world is overcome, 'tis now under foot, which u&s;ed to have its &s;eat in the very heart. Thus be|lievers find this day a day of power. They are powerfully drawn to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and as powerfully upheld and &s;upported by him.</P>
<P>And of this power the ungodly are not without &s;ome ta&s;te and experience. Mighty convictions and re&s;traints for a while they have, but by degrees they grow &s;tupid, and get loo&s;e again, and then fulfil their fle&s;hly
<PB N="51" REF="003114_0028_0FF087234D507668">
and their worldly lu&s;ts with the greater ea|gerne&s;s; ju&s;t as water being dam'd up, when that re&s;traint is taken away, doth run with greater &s;trength and &s;peed for having been re&s;trained.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>This Day of Grace it is but one, when this is gone, another is not to be expected</HI>: In Nature there is a vici&s;&s;itude of day and night, even at midnight 'twill not be many hours before the morning, and the light return, <HI>Soles occi|dere &amp; redire po&s;&s;unt</HI>; but the night which follows after the Day of Grace is everla&s;ting. The abu&s;ed light of the Go&s;pel will be fol|lowed with that which is called, <HI>The black|ne&s;s of darkne&s;s for ever.</HI> Life indeed will re|turn again at the general re&s;urrection, but another &s;ea&s;on of mercy will not be vouch|&s;afed. The Day of Grace is like the Dove, which <HI>Noah</HI> &s;ent the third time out of the Ark, when once 'tis flown away, 'twill re|turn no more. What mean the carele&s;s world to &s;port, and play, and &s;in away this golden &s;ea&s;on? Every moment that &s;lips by you is irrevocable; and 'tis but a little while, and the whole &s;tock will be &s;pent of this accepted time: Oh improve &s;ome of it, at lea&s;t, before it be all gone.</P>
<P>If after death you were certain to be &s;ent into the world again, and to hear the joyful &s;ound of the Go&s;pel again, and that the
<PB N="52" REF="003114_0029_0FF08726583E67D8">
Lord again would try you, and wait that he might be gracious, then pre&s;ent carle&s;|ne&s;s were not altogether &s;o much without apology. But &s;ince immediately upon your di&s;&s;olution, you mu&s;t go to your long, your eternal home, either of weal or wo, Oh let Eternity, which is ju&s;t at the door, be pro|vided for, before this your day be ended.</P>
<P>Thus you have the Properties of the Day of Grace. In the fourth place I am to lay down the Rea&s;ons, why &s;uch a Day of Grace is granted. Several rea&s;ons of this may be a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>One &s;hall be drawn from the Son's Incarna|tion, and taking our nature on him.</HI> Hence it comes to pa&s;s, that unto Man &s;uch kindne&s;s is expre&s;&s;ed. The Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>Verily, he took not on him the nature of Angels, but he took on him the &s;eed of Abraham, Heb.</HI> 2.16. He was made in the likene&s;s of Men, therefore mankind is the dearer to him. There is a difference put between apo&s;tate Angels and fallen Men; I &s;peak even of tho&s;e, that through their own wickedne&s;s and folly mi&s;s of &s;alvation. The reprobate Angels never had a remedy provided, nor a Day of Grace afforded; Chri&s;t a&s;&s;umed not their nature, but as &s;oon as ever they had &s;inned, they fell, like lightning, &s;uddenly, in the twink|ling
<PB N="53" REF="003114_0029_0FF08726583E67D8">
of an eye, from Heaven to Hell. But Man was not thus dealt with; even tho&s;e whom the Apo&s;tle calls <HI>Ve&s;&s;els of Wrath fitted to de&s;truction, are yet endured with much long|&s;uffering, Rom.</HI> 9.22. Their &s;alvation is in it &s;elf really po&s;&s;ible, I &s;ay, <HI>in it &s;elf,</HI> though all things con&s;ider'd, there is an impo&s;&s;ibility of any other event, than the de&s;truction of &s;inners continuing in their rebellions; and this real po&s;&s;ibility of &s;alvation will make them ca&s;t the whole blame of their perdition on them&s;elves, that the day of &s;alvation was trifled away, and the &s;alvation of that day was neglected.</P>
<P>This matter may be made more obvious and plain by a &s;imilitude. The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul, Acts</HI> 26. admoni&s;heth the Centurion, who was to conduct him to <HI>Rome,</HI> that the voyage they were about to make, would be with much damage and hurt, not only of the lading and &s;hip, but al&s;o of their lives. Who can deny, that the tarrying in the Haven where they were, and where they might have been in &s;afeguard, was in it &s;elf really po&s;&s;ible? and they could not rea&s;ona|bly lay the blame of their &s;hipwrack on God's decree and determination, but upon their own ra&s;hne&s;s. In like manner &s;inners are admoni&s;hed, that if they go on in wick|edne&s;s 'twill be to their hurt and eternal
<PB N="54" REF="003114_0030_0FF086DD175217C0">
damage, not only of their lives, but al&s;o of their &s;ouls. Who can deny, that the ab|&s;taining from &s;uch and &s;uch &s;ins is really po&s;&s;ible? therefore God's decree is not to be blamed (which brings no coaction upon the will of Man) but Mans own perver&s;ne&s;s, if he is wrack'd, and mi&s;carries to eternity.</P>
<P>We read of the <HI>kindne&s;s and love of God our Saviour towards Man appearing, Tit.</HI> 3.4. The Son of God was manife&s;ted in the fle&s;h of Man; and upon this &s;core it is that light comes into the world, and &s;hines even up|on tho&s;e dark &s;ouls that are unwilling to comprehend it, and &s;alvation is proffer'd al&s;o unto them that refu&s;e to embrace it.</P>
<P N="2">2. A Day of Grace is granted, <HI>that the power of God may be known.</HI> His power is much &s;poken of in the Go&s;pel, and believers feel the wonderful effects of that power. We are inform'd of a twofold Creation, the fir&s;t and the &s;econd, the old and the new: In the fir&s;t Creation, the power of God was glorious indeed, in making the world out of nothing; but here, as there was nothing to help, &s;o there was nothing to re&s;i&s;t this power of God: But in the new Creation, in making new creatures, there is a great oppo&s;ition and re&s;i&s;tance met withal, and how glorious is the power of God that over|comes it? What wonders are wrought in
<PB N="55" REF="003114_0030_0FF086DD175217C0">
this Day of Grace by the hand of the Lord? He not only &s;ays, <HI>Let there be light,</HI> where darkne&s;s is, but where darkne&s;s is loved: He not only &s;ays, <HI>Ari&s;e,</HI> to them that are dead, but to them that are unwilling to be rai&s;ed. <HI>Indi&s;po&s;ition</HI> and <HI>oppo&s;ition</HI> likewi&s;e are to be found in &s;inners, when the Lord fir&s;t comes to work upon them. The Bul|lock cannot endure the yoak, though hereby its life is lengthened; for the bea&s;t that works not is fatted immediately for the &s;laughter. A &s;inner is likened <HI>to a bullock un|accu&s;tomed to the yoak, Jer.</HI> 31.18. he di&s;co|vers a great reluctancy and unwillingne&s;s to yield; now in turning &s;uch an one (with who&s;e corruption and lu&s;ts Satan joyns, to hinder conver&s;ion) the power of God is the more to be admired.</P>
<P N="3">3. A Day of Grace is granted <HI>for the ma|nife&s;tation of divine goodne&s;s and mercy.</HI> The Lord is &s;aid to <HI>delight in mercy,</HI> Mic. 7.18. therefore he allows a day, in which mercy may be had, and now it is to be obtained or never. It is not &s;mall mercy that rai&s;es the &s;ons of Men out of tho&s;e depths of mi&s;e|ry into which they are fallen: <HI>Great is thy mercy towards me,</HI> &s;aith the P&s;almi&s;t; and the greatne&s;s of it is demon&s;trated, <HI>for thou ha&s;t redeemed my &s;oul out of the lowe&s;t hell.</HI> And if the unworthine&s;s of Man be duly
<PB N="56" REF="003114_0031_0FF0872DAA000F58">
con&s;idered the freene&s;s of this mercy is to be admired, as much as the abundance of it. Mercy is free, as well as plenteous; 'tis expre&s;&s;ed not only above de&s;ert, but without de&s;ert, nay contrary to de&s;ert; therefore according to that ancient Fathers phra&s;e, 'tis <HI>Omni modo gratuita,</HI> free every way, Hence it is, that Saints have u&s;ed that as an argument to obtain mercy, which one would have thought &s;hould have quite di&s;couraged them from entertaining any hopes of it, namely, <HI>the greatne&s;s of &s;in.</HI> P&s;al. 25.11. <HI>For thy Name &s;ake pardon my iniquity, for it is great</HI>; as if he had &s;aid, <HI>Lord, I know 'tis thy de&s;ign in this day of grace to manife&s;t and to magnifie thy mercy; and the greatne&s;s of my &s;in will &s;erve to &s;et thy mercy higher; the richne&s;s and freene&s;s of it will be the more wondred at, becau&s;e &s;hewn to a gro&s;s tran&s;gre&s;&s;or.</HI> Mercy, nay, abundant mercy is expre&s;&s;ed in ju&s;tifying the ungod|ly, in quickening the dead, and <HI>begetting them again to a lively hope,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.3. And this is the only &s;ea&s;on; if it be not now laid hold on, it will be clean gone for ever.</P>
<P N="4">4. A Day of Grace is granted, <HI>that the Lord's long-&s;uffering and forbearance may be wondred at.</HI> He is an eye-witne&s;s of all the wickedne&s;s that is done again&s;t him; he hates all the &s;in he &s;ees, and can ea&s;ily take vengeance upon the committers of it; he

&s;tands not in the lea&s;t need of any of them, and yet he &s;pares them, and that a great while: Oh how great is the &s;tock of his Patience! <HI>Lord, what is Man, that thou doe&s;t forbear him &s;o long, &s;ince thou can&s;t &s;o ea&s;ily cru&s;h him?

<P N="5">5.

<P N="1">1. <HI>In this day of Grace, to &s;leep is very im|proper.

<P>The Lethurgy of the Con&s;cience is a &s;ore malady; when the Sinners heart is ever and anon ready to drop a&s;leep, notwith|&s;tanding all the Means which are u&s;ed to rouze it&punc; But though Threatnings, though Judgments will not awaken &s;ome, that are &s;eized upon by the Spirit of Slumber, yet I'll tell you what will do it; The &s;ight of an angry &s;in-revenging Judge upon the Tribunal; the &s;eeing and feeling of the Torments of Hell, will awaken them that are mo&s;t fa&s;t a&s;leep in Sin: What, wilt thou &s;leep upon the pit's brink? U&s;ually Sinners fears lea&s;t, when becau&s;e of the nearne&s;s of Evil, they have mo&s;t rea&s;on to be afraid.</P>

as no plague, which is infinitely wor&s;e than that of <HI>Egypt</HI>; if you e&s;teem the famine of the Word (which is wor&s;e than <HI>a famine of bread,</HI> or <HI>a thir&s;t of water, Amos</HI> 8.11) no &s;uch great judgment, as long as from tempo|ral judgments you are exempted, this is a mo&s;t wretched temper of &s;oul; and the Lord mu&s;t needs be angry, when the great|e&s;t mercies and favours are &s;lighted; and what puni&s;hment more probable or equal than to be deprived of them?</P>
<P N="4">4. Another &s;ign that the Day of Grace is near an end, is <HI>contradicting and per&s;ecuting of the Lords Me&s;&s;engers.</HI> We read, <HI>Mat.</HI> 22. of a Marriage fea&s;t prepared, &s;ervants are &s;ent forth to invite many to the Marriage; &s;ome, who were invited, took tho&s;e &s;er|vants and intreated them &s;pightfully. Could the King which made this Supper bear this? No, he was wrath, and did de&s;troy the&s;e per&s;ecutors, and none of them were permitted to partake of tho&s;e good things he had provided, and once proffer'd to them. That is a dreadful text, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 36.16. <HI>But they mocked the Me&s;&s;engers of God, and de&s;pi&s;ed his words, and mi&s;u&s;ed his Prophets until the wrath of the Lord aro&s;e again&s;t his people, and there was no remedy.</HI> The A|po&s;tles <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> preached the Go&s;|pel, the multitude flock to hear them; when
<PB N="77" REF="003114_0041_0FF086FC20B74650">
the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;aw the multitudes, they were fil|led with envy, and &s;pake again&s;t the A|po&s;tles doctrine; but the Apo&s;tles &s;eeing them reject the Go&s;pel, and them, in &s;uch a way, make this reply, <HI>It was needful that the Word of God &s;hould be fir&s;t &s;poken unto you, but &s;ince you put it from you,</HI> you &s;hall not be troubled with it, <HI>lo, we turn to the Gentiles,</HI> Acts 13.45, 46. and then to the <HI>Gentiles</HI> did the light ari&s;e and &s;hine forth, and the <HI>Jews</HI> were left under darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>Another &s;ign the Day of Grace is near an end, if not quite ended, is <HI>ob&s;tinacy in &s;ome opinions, which are damnable.</HI> When fundamental truths are denied, when all means u&s;ed to reclaim and turn the erro|neous, through prejudice, do but confirm and harden them, how near to de&s;perate is their ca&s;e? When the Lord &s;ends &s;trong delu&s;ions to any, and they believe a lye, Oh 'tis to be feared he intends their ruin, and that <HI>their judgment will now linger,</HI> will not &s;lumber long: 2 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 2.11, 12. <HI>And for this cau&s;e God &s;hall &s;end them &s;trong delu&s;ion, that they &s;hould believe a lye, that they all might be damned, who believe not the truth, but had plea&s;ure in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Error may extin|gui&s;h the light of the Go&s;pel, and cau&s;e the Ordinances of God to be &s;lighted, the Word to be ca&s;t a&s;ide, and the Spirit to de|part,
<PB N="78" REF="003114_0042_0FF08679DBE914A0">
and leave &s;inners to the &s;eduction of Satan, and the imagination of their dark and fooli&s;h hearts. Let me therefore &s;peak to you in the words of the Apo&s;tle, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3 17. <HI>Ye therefore, beloved, &s;eeing ye know the&s;e things before, le&s;t ye al&s;o being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Another fatal &s;ign, that the Day of Grace is near its period, is <HI>an habit of back|&s;liding.</HI> Hark how the Lord upbraids his people with this; and after, they are told of their de&s;perate &s;tate; <HI>Jer.</HI> 8.4, 5. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Laid, &s;hall they fall and not ari&s;e? &s;hall they turn away, and not return? why is this people of Jeru&s;alem &s;lidden back with a per|petual back&s;liding?</HI> And then it follows, ver. 20, 21, 22. <HI>The harve&s;t is pa&s;t, the Summer is ended, and we are not &s;aved. For the hurt of the daughter of my people I am black, a&s;toni&s;hment hath taken hold upon me. Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no Phy&s;ician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people re|cover'd?</HI> There are many Profe&s;&s;ors, who &s;ome times look <HI>Sion</HI>-ward, and have &s;ome common work upon them, but after do draw back, and by often doing &s;o contract &s;uch a &s;earedne&s;s, that they make light of doing &s;o. They do po&s;&s;ibly under &s;ome awakenings confe&s;s their &s;ins, but quickly
<PB N="79" REF="003114_0042_0FF08679DBE914A0">
return to the commi&s;&s;ion of them again; they are convinced 'tis their duty, and yet they will not be per&s;waded to do the work of the Lord vigorou&s;ly; they are convinced of &s;uch and &s;uch &s;ins, and yet they will not be di&s;&s;waded from following after them. They may have a <HI>form of godline&s;s,</HI> but they will not be brought under the <HI>power of godli|ne&s;s,</HI> nor give their con&s;ent to be &s;incerely and thorowly &s;anctified. Divers motions and proffers of a&s;&s;i&s;tance they have had from the Spirit, but all in vain, they are bent upon back&s;liding. Surely then they have ju&s;t ground to fear, that &s;entence is ready to be, if not already pronounced, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 24.13. <HI>Becau&s;e I have purged thee, and thou wa&s;t not purged, thou &s;halt not be purged from thy fil|thine&s;s any more, till I have cau&s;ed my fury to re&s;t upon thee.</HI></P>
<P>Thus concerning the Signs when the Day of Grace is declining and drawing towards night. Pre&s;umptuous &s;oul, if thou finde&s;t in thy &s;elf any of the&s;e &s;igns, Oh &s;tartle ex|ceedingly at the di&s;covery, and before the la&s;t hour of the day be ended, enter into, and labour to purpo&s;e in the Lords Vine|yard.</P>
<P N="2">2. A &s;econd word of Caution is this, <HI>Don't ra&s;hly conclude the Day of Grace is pa&s;s'd, and that the Sun is already &s;et upon you.</HI> This
<PB N="80" REF="003114_0043_0FF087059E503930">
is an extreme contrary to that of pre&s;ump|tuous ones, which tempted and troubled &s;pirits are very prone to run into. They are ready to take up <HI>Jobs</HI> complaint, only with &s;ome &s;ad variations, <HI>Oh that I were as in months pa&s;t&punc; as in the days when God would have pre&s;erved me! when his candle &s;hined upon my head, and by his light I might have been de|livered from the power of darkne&s;s! The Al|mighty was then with me; he call'd upon me to turn, and was ready upon my turning to hear my calling to him. But now I cry, and he doth not hear me; I &s;tand up, and he regards me not: I have &s;o bitterly provoked him to leave me, that I am afraid he is now gone for ever.</HI></P>
<P>Three things are here to be con&s;ider'd.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>No man can certainly conclude concerning another, that his day is pa&s;s'd.</HI> If we con&s;ult the Scripture, we &s;hall find tho&s;e that have gone far in wickedne&s;s at la&s;t reclaimed; therefore we &s;hould not de&s;pair of the wor&s;t. Indeed the pride and &s;tubbornne&s;s of the ungodly makes us fear that all our labour will be in vain, yet we &s;peak &s;till, <HI>and exhort and reprove with all long-&s;uffering,</HI> 2 Tim 4 2. becau&s;e with God all things are po&s;&s;ible; and tho&s;e &s;heep that are gone much a&s;tray, &s;eemingly pa&s;t reach, he can lay hold of, and bring home again to the &s;old.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="81" REF="003114_0043_0FF087059E503930">2. <HI>No man ought to draw &s;uch a &s;ad conclu|&s;ion in reference to him&s;elf, that the &s;ea&s;on of mercy is quite expired.</HI> Though our election may be made &s;ure, yet reprobation is not pre&s;ently to be di&s;cover'd: Though upon thy comparing thy heart and life with the Word of God, thou may&s;t know of a cer|tainty thou ha&s;t no grace; yet thou ha&s;t no warrant to &s;ay, thou never &s;halt have any: As filthy as thou have been wa&s;hed; as un|holy as thou have been &s;anctified; as guilty as thou have been <HI>ju&s;tified in the Name of the the Lord Je&s;us, and by the Spirit of our God,</HI> 1 Cor. 6.11.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>When Satan pe&s;ters you with thoughts, that there is no help remaining, but the accepta|ble time is all &s;lipt away, rather hope the con|trary</HI>; for Satan is a liar; and becau&s;e he is &s;o bu&s;ie about you, 'tis a &s;ign that he is afraid of loo&s;ing you; if he knew certain|ly that your day of vi&s;itation were gone, he would be &s;ure of you, and &s;o he would be quiet, and not as he doth, mole&s;t and trouble you.</P>
<P>But for the further relief of tho&s;e, who are apt to di&s;courage them&s;elves, and to damp their own endeavours after grace, by thinking the day is ended, and 'tis now too late, I &s;hall do two things. Fir&s;t, <HI>Lay down &s;ome probable &s;igns.</HI> Secondly, <HI>Some
<PB N="82" REF="003114_0044_0FF0870B0ECAAEA0">
certain &s;igns of this Day of Grace's continuance.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>probable &s;igns</HI> of its continuance are the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. When the heart is inclined to &s;it un|der powerful means, who knows but by the word of faith which you attend upon, the grace of faith may be wrought in you.</P>
<P N="2">2. When ever and anon the heart is &s;tir|red, and Con&s;cience awakened by the Spi|rit, and the Lord doth not let you alone in your iniquities, nor &s;uffer you to &s;leep quietly and undi&s;turbedly the &s;leep of death.</P>
<P N="3">3. When tho&s;e fal&s;e grounds of hope, which you have built upon, are more and more di&s;cover'd; when you are made to perceive the vanity of confidence in your &s;elves, or in your own righteou&s;ne&s;s, and that 'tis not enough to be &s;omewhat bet|ter than the wor&s;t are; and that the name of Chri&s;tians &s;ignifies nothing, unle&s;s you <HI>depart from iniquity,</HI> 2 Tim. 2.19. Who knows, but that being beaten off from in|&s;ufficient bottoms, you may at length be &s;ettled upon the right foundation, Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">4. When there is a great fear lea&s;t the Day of Grace &s;hould be pa&s;t, 'tis to be hoped that 'tis not pa&s;t. <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> in the next war far from any &s;uch fear. U&s;ually &s;ouls are le&s;t &s;en&s;ele&s;s, when the Lord leaves
<PB N="83" REF="003114_0044_0FF0870B0ECAAEA0">
them. Of the old world, and of <HI>Sodom</HI> 'tis &s;aid, <HI>They eat, they drank, they bought, they &s;old, they planted, they builded, they married and were given in marriage,</HI> and minded no|thing el&s;e but things of this nature, though the floud was &s;o near the one, and fire rea|dy to con&s;ume the other.</P>
<P N="5">5. When &s;inners are inqui&s;itive what they &s;hall do to be &s;aved, 'tis probable at lea&s;t, that the day of &s;alvation is not terminated, but &s;alvation is near, and may be obtained, if the terms on which 'tis proffer'd are not quarrel'd at, but &s;ubmitted to as good and equal.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd&punc; place follow the <HI>certain &s;igns</HI> that the Day of Grace is not yet con|cluded.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>This day is not pa&s;s'd when the Soul is for peace with God upon any conditions.</HI> If this be the yielding frame and temper of thy heart, certainly thou do&s;t not only know, but al&s;o art willing to do the things which belong unto thy peace. If this be thy lan|guage, <HI>Lord! Doth a right eye offend thee? it &s;hall be pluckt out; doth a right hand offend thee? it &s;hall be cut off: Tho&s;e &s;ins that &s;eem mo&s;t &s;weet and nece&s;&s;ary, as long as thou hate&s;t them, that is &s;ufficient to di&s;commend them, I am re&s;olved to love them no longer!</HI> Thou ha&s;t no rea&s;on to give up all for lo&s;t; No, no,
<PB N="84" REF="003114_0045_0FF0873E0ABC2B40">
being thus made willing to <HI>ca&s;t away every tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, iniquity &s;hall not be thy ruin,</HI> as you may &s;ee <HI>Exek.</HI> 18.30.</P>
<P N="2">2. This Day of Grace it is not pa&s;s'd, <HI>whon the &s;inner &s;ets open the door of his heart, that Chri&s;t the Lord may enter.</HI> The promi&s;e is mo&s;t &s;ure, <HI>If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him, and &s;up with him, and he &s;hall &s;up with me, Rev.</HI> 3.20. Chri&s;t complains of the <HI>Jews,</HI> that <HI>They would not come to him that they might have life</HI>; but if any are made willing to come, the waters of life are open, and none that de|&s;ire &s;hall be denied them, <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.17. <HI>Let him that is a thir&s;t come, and whoever will, let him drink of the water of life freely.</HI> Do&s;t thou know Chri&s;t? Art thou acquainted with his Kingdom as well as his Prie&s;thood? and art thou willing to have his Kingdom &s;et up in thy heart, and thy very thoughts and affections brought into obedience and captivity? Art thou willing thus to receive him? Certainly thou &s;halt be received by him, and <HI>have power to become a child of God,</HI> John 1.12.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Day of Grace is not pa&s;s'd, <HI>if Grace be de&s;ired above all things in the world.</HI> If the edge of thy appetite towards the things that peri&s;h is turn'd, if the pearl of price be indeed of price in thy e&s;teem;
<PB N="85" REF="003114_0045_0FF0873E0ABC2B40">
if that be thy will and de&s;ire, which is <HI>the will of God, even thy &s;anctification</HI>; &s;urely the Spirit is &s;o far from having left thee, that he is in thee: 'Tis he who rai&s;es this <HI>hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> which as it <HI>&s;hall be &s;atisfied,</HI> &s;o it argues thy e&s;tate ble&s;&s;ed, <HI>Matth.</HI> 5.6.</P>
<P N="4">4. This Day of Grace is not pa&s;s'd, <HI>when the heart is grieved for the mi&s;pence of &s;o much of this day, and is willing to live the re&s;t of it to the will of God,</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 4.2. If you judge that the time pa&s;t of your life doth &s;uffice, nay, more then &s;uffice, to have been fool|i&s;h and di&s;obedient to God, and to have o|bey'd and &s;erved divers lu&s;ts and plea&s;ures, and if you re&s;olve to dedicate the remain|der of your lives in the fle&s;h to the Lord, that he may di&s;po&s;e of it, certainly the Lord will accept both of your time and you: Though you come in late, &s;o it be but pre|&s;ently, into the Vineyard, you &s;hall receive a penny; and diligence in your Ma&s;ters work will be rewarded with your Ma&s;ters joy.</P>
<P N="3">3. A third word of Caution is this, <HI>Take heed of being &s;trengthened and emboldned by the general practi&s;e to idle this Day of Grace away.</HI> We read concerning <HI>Lai&s;h, That the People dwelt carele&s;s, after the manner of the Zid<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">nians, quiet and &s;ecure,</HI> Judg. 18.7. And truly
<PB N="86" REF="003114_0046_0FEFA82DA947BFC0">
this is the manner of mo&s;t in the world, careful po&s;&s;ibly they are about many things, but as to the main thing utterly carele&s;s: Their time is of little, and their &s;ouls of le&s;s value in their judgments. But that the humour and cu&s;tom of the world may not be followed, let the&s;e con&s;iderations be ponder'd by you.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The mo&s;t in the world are blind.</HI> As <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;peaks, they are void of coun&s;el, nei|ther have they any under&s;tanding in them, <HI>they are not wi&s;e to con&s;ider their latter end,</HI> Deut. 32.28, 29. nor the worth of that gracious &s;ea&s;on, in which alone preparati|on can be made for it. And &s;hall we write after the Coppies which a company of fools &s;et us? Shall we follow the blind, that quickly will fall into the ditch, and have not eyes to &s;ee their danger?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The mo&s;t are unbelieving, a froward ge|neration, children, in whom there is no faith,</HI> and from this root of infidelity doth &s;pring their prodigality of the day of Grace. Did they indeed believe that death will make an end of them, but that after this is fini&s;hed, another life will follow, either of the grea|te&s;t joy, or of as great &s;orrow; and that joy or &s;orrow in the next world will be their lot, according as the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on is, or is not improved; certainly they
<PB N="87" REF="003114_0046_0FEFA82DA947BFC0">
would be more &s;paring of that which is &s;o precious. Oh the &s;ecret pagani&s;m that is in the hearts of multitudes! they live as if Eternity were a fiction, and Hell a fa|ble; but will it be thought a fable, when they feel the tortures of it? And what &s;hall we tread in the &s;teps of &s;uch Infidels? No, <HI>we are to follow,</HI> not the unbelief, but <HI>the faith of others,</HI> Heb. 13.7. <HI>Who&s;e faith follow, con&s;idering the end of their conver&s;ation.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Are not many, who are &s;uch &s;pendthrifts of this Day of Grace, &s;elf-condemned?</HI> How often doth Con&s;cience reproach them for their &s;piritual &s;loth? and 'tis very unrea&s;on|able to go in that way, which they them|&s;elves do frequently condemn them&s;elves for: Idlene&s;s is a &s;in which leaves behind it a great deal of regret and di&s;&s;atisfaction in the heart; 'tis common for the &s;lothful to hear a voice behind them, &s;aying, <HI>Time is a trea&s;ure that ought not to be thus fooli&s;hly, and to no purpo&s;e, wa&s;ted.</HI></P>

<P>Let me per&s;wade all to a &s;erious improve|ment of this day of their gracious vi&s;itation. The Arguments to prevail are the&s;e,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>This day is continually pa&s;&s;ing:</HI> Your gla&s;s is running every moment, whether you &s;leep
<PB N="88" REF="003114_0047_0FEFA870A09B1390">

Your days are but an hand|breadth; and whether of this hand breadth there be an rich remaining, is a que&s;tion. <HI>Time</HI> is not unfitly <HI>pictur'd with wings,</HI> be|cau&s;e it flies &s;o fa&s;t away; and <HI>bald behind,</HI> becau&s;e you cannot catch hold of it to pull it back.

<P N="2">2. <HI>You all mu&s;t be reckoned with, how you have husbanded this gracious &s;ea&s;on.</HI> Oh what a ca&s;e will the &s;lothful &s;oul be in, when death gives him a &s;ummons; and he hears that word, <HI>Render an account of thy &s;teward|&s;hip, for thou may&s;t be no longer &s;teward.</HI> Con|&s;cience mu&s;t needs very much amaze the &s;inner, when it &s;hall before the Judge bring in &s;uch Indictments as the&s;e again&s;t him. <HI>So much of this day of &s;alvation was &s;pent in immoderate recreations: So much in carnal and ungodly company: So much in eager pur&s;uing af|ter the deceitful riches and plea&s;ures of this world: So much in making provi&s;ion for the fle&s;h, that the vile and ba&s;e lu&s;ts of it might be fulfilled:
<PB N="89" REF="003114_0047_0FEFA870A09B1390">
So much in proud and towring imaginations: So much in amorous and filthy mu&s;ings: So much in vain and rotten communication: So much in Ta|verns, and Ale-hou&s;es, and in the Harlots habi|tations: So much in tricking and adorning the body: And Chri&s;t and the &s;oul were all the mean while neglected and forgotten. Often ask thy &s;elf this Que&s;tion</HI>; Do I &s;pend my Day of Grace after &s;uch a manner, as I may account for it at la&s;t with comfort? Such thoughts would make you &s;erious.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Let the diligence of the earthly minded, in improving the worlds day, &s;hame you out of your idlene&s;s in this day of &s;alvation.</HI> If the greedy trade&s;man hears of an excellent bargain, what madne&s;s doth he count it to neglect the &s;ea&s;on wherein he may have it?

<P>This is a &s;ubject no le&s;s profitable than plea&s;ant, <HI>Dulce nomen pacis,</HI> the name of peace hath a &s;weet &s;ound. <HI>Peace</HI> implies a ble&s;&s;ed conjunction between heaven and earth, between the Creator and us his crea|tures; and, which follows here-upon, a &s;a|tisfaction and quietne&s;s in our hearts, &s;o that tho&s;e di&s;turbances and di&s;orders, which were cau&s;ed by &s;in, are becalmed and re|gulated.

<P>This Peace with God, &s;everal things are implied in it.</P>
<P N="1">1. Peace with God implies <HI>the removal of his wrath.</HI> All &s;in is pardon'd and done a|way in the blood of Chri&s;t, and guilt being cover'd, the Lords anger cea&s;es, for &s;in is the only provocation to him.

<PB N="96" REF="003114_0051_0FEFA868F3D25B80">
middle wall of partition between God and unregenerate &s;inners; the former, namely, the Gulph, indeed cannot be pa&s;&s;ed thorow; but the latter, the middle wall, may be bro|ken down, and 'tis broken down when our peace is made: His wrath abides on tho&s;e that will not believe, that refu&s;e to be re|conciled; but his anger cea&s;es towards them who believe and yield to him. Thrice hap|py they, who are ea&s;ed of &s;uch a load as the wrath of God!</P>
<P>Speak O ye troubled Con&s;ciences, is not this anger your greate&s;t trouble, and that which makes the deepe&s;t wounds? Speak, O Hells Inhabitants, is not divine wrath a puni&s;hment too heavy for you to bear? is not this the weight which &s;inks you lowe&s;t in the bottomle&s;s pit? Finally, hear what Chri&s;t &s;pake when he felt the di&s;plea&s;ure of his Father, <HI>My Soul,</HI> &s;ayes he, <HI>is exceeding &s;orrowful, even unto death.</HI> Well may they rejoyce, who through Je&s;us are freed from this di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P N="2">2. Peace with God implies <HI>an intere&s;t in his love.</HI> His love is every whit as great to|wards tho&s;e who are at Peace with him, as before his wrath was. We may cea&s;e to be angry with another, and yet not have any great affection for him. But where the Lord turns away his wrath, the &s;tream of
<PB N="97" REF="003114_0051_0FEFA868F3D25B80">
his love doth run amain. The time of our reconciliation and returning is called <HI>a time of love</HI>: And this love is the more to be admired, becau&s;e it finds us in our blood, which makes us de&s;erve loathing; it finds no beauty, no comeline&s;s at all in us, but what it puts upon us. The Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of <HI>rich mercy,</HI> and <HI>great love,</HI> which the re|conciled have an intere&s;t in, <HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> 2.4, 5. <HI>But God, who is rich in mercy, for the great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in &s;ins, hath quickned us together with Chri&s;t: by grace ye are &s;aved.</HI> This love of God is exceeding liberal, it &s;ets open his fulne&s;s which is &s;o all-&s;ufficient, and we may come, and take what we need at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>And as they, who are at peace with God, have an intere&s;t in his love, &s;o this love doth enkindle love in them to him again: The unrea&s;onable enmity of their hearts a|gain&s;t God is cured; the &s;oul lifts up it &s;elf to God, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 25.1. which before very un|rea&s;onably doated upon the World, and much more unrea&s;onably upon its own lu&s;ts.</P>
<P N="3">3. Peace with God implies <HI>the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of a &s;ure and everla&s;ting Covenant between him and us.</HI> As the Lord makes this Cove|nant, &s;o he makes over him&s;elf in this Co|venant; He becomes ours, and he takes us for his own, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16.8. <HI>Now when I pa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="98" REF="003114_0052_0FEFA85F05C5C0B0">
by thee, and looked upon thee, behold thy time was the time of love, and I &s;pread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedne&s;s; yea, I &s;ware unto thee, and entered into Covenant with thee, and thou became&s;t mine.</HI> This Covenant is &s;tyled <HI>the Covenant of Peace.</HI> The Lord being once a friend will never become an enemy! he will be merciful to the unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of them that are in Covenant with him; and as he had engaged not to leave and for&s;ake them, &s;o he hath promi&s;ed to put his love and fear into their hearts, that they &s;hall not leave and for&s;ake him: they are apt to be un&s;teadfa&s;t, 'tis well they have to do with a God that is faithful and changeth not; to this is owing their per&s;everance and their ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. That's a &s;weet place, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 54&punc; 10. <HI>For the mountains &s;hall depart, and the hills be removed, but my kindne&s;s &s;hall not depart from thee, neither the Covenant of my peace be removed, &s;aith the Lord that hath mercy on thee.</HI> Oh that our hearts were but &s;et to &s;tudy this Covenant of our God! How precious, how &s;uitable are the Promi&s;es of it! We are guilty, defiled, troubled, weak and lo&s;t creatures, but in this Covenant, Pardon, the Spirit, Peace, &s;trengthening Grace, and eternal Salvation are made over. And he that hath promi&s;ed can as ea&s;ily perform as promi&s;e. Nay, Chri&s;t hath con|firmed
<PB N="99" REF="003114_0052_0FEFA85F05C5C0B0">
this Covenant by his death, &s;o that it cannot be altered. Our Lord at his death engaged his Father to be a Friend un|to all that did or &s;hould believe in him; and therefore that he will be a &s;ure and never failing Friend, may &s;ecurely be built upon.</P>
<P N="4">4. Peace with God implies, <HI>his taking us into a new and near relation to him&s;elf.</HI> He makes us his Children, and &s;urely then we &s;hall abide in his hou&s;e for ever. He not only &s;ays I will be <HI>a God to you,</HI> but al&s;o, <HI>I will be a Father unto you, and ye &s;hall be my &s;ons and daughters, &s;aith the Lord Almighty,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.18. Well may we wonder with the Apo&s;tle, 1 <HI>Job.</HI> 3.1. <HI>Behold, what manner of love the Father hath be&s;towed upon us, that we &s;hould be called the Sons of God</HI>! Tho&s;e who are at peace with God are e&s;pou&s;ed unto Je&s;us Chri&s;t, unto &s;uch, a Bill of divorce &s;hall never be given. And as Chri&s;t becomes their Husband, and God their Father, &s;o they con&s;ent to carry it like Children, to love and fear the Lord in a child like man|ner, to follow fully and hard after him; they are willing to be faithful unto Chri&s;t, and to be &s;ubject unto his commands, which are far from being grievous.</P>
<P N="5">5. Peace with God implies <HI>freedom of ac|ce&s;s to him.</HI> Tho&s;e who proudly harden
<PB N="100" REF="003114_0053_0FEFA85CA127BF48">
them&s;elves in &s;in, the Lord beholds them afar off, but he is nigh to tho&s;e who&s;e peace is made; &s;uch are invited not only to come, <HI>but to come with boldne&s;s to the throne of grace</HI>; and mercy and grace to help &s;hall not be denied them, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4. <HI>ult.</HI> They may with|out di&s;couragement approach to God, and tell him of their temptations; He is ready to &s;uccour them: they may tell him of their weakne&s;s, he is ready to &s;trengthen them with might in their inward man; they may tell him of the di&s;tempers, which they are burthen'd with, he is ready to heal them; they may &s;pread their de&s;ires before him, he is ready to fulfil the de&s;ire of the humble, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 10 17. <HI>Lord, thou ha&s;t heard the de&s;ire of the humble, thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cau&s;e thine ear to hear.</HI></P>
<P>And as the Soul, who&s;e peace is made hath freedom of acce&s;s to God, &s;o God hath freedom of acce&s;s unto the &s;oul. When Chri&s;t knocks, the heart opens; when the Spirit moves, he doth prevail; when God comes to dwell, the heart yields it &s;elf to be his Temple and habitation; and how much hereby is the &s;oul dignified and advanced? The &s;inner it no longer fooli&s;hly &s;tubborn, he denies the Lord nothing; when he re|quires his heart, his de&s;ire, his love, none of the&s;e &s;hall be kept backary longer from him.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="101" REF="003114_0053_0FEFA85CA127BF48">6. Peace with God <HI>implies fellow&s;hip and communion with him.</HI> There is a kind of a <HI>commonne&s;s</HI> between God and them that are reconciled to him; whatever is in God is theirs, becau&s;e <HI>God is not a&s;hamed to be called their God,</HI> Heb. 11.16. They have an in|tere&s;t and propriety in his Power, and Wi&s;|dom, and Mercy, and fulne&s;s, and they are &s;en&s;ible of the ble&s;&s;ed effects of the&s;e and o|ther of the Lords Attributes. God having given them him&s;elf, what will he refu&s;e to communicate? He is ever manife&s;ting him|&s;elf, and be&s;towing tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings upon them, which Aliens never do receive. He deals not towards them with a &s;paring hand; the promi&s;e runs thus, <HI>Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it,</HI> P&s;al. 81.10. And this is certain, that the more open our mouths are, the more open will the hand of God be.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee what Peace above, what Peace with God is.</P>
<P>In the next place I am to &s;peak of Peace within.</P>
<P>'Tis natural to Man to be his own enemy and tormentor. He that was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with unclean &s;pirits, 'tis &s;aid no Man could bind him, no not with chains, but he was in the Tombs and Mountains, crying and cutting him&s;elf with &s;tones, <HI>Mar.</HI> 5.5. In like man|ner, a child of di&s;obedience, in whom the
<PB N="102" REF="003114_0054_0FEFA84D3AE0C4E8">
Prince of the power of the Air worketh, will not be bound, will not be hindred from doing his &s;oul harm; tho&s;e cords of re&s;traint that the Word ca&s;ts upon him, he breaks a&s;under and ca&s;ts away; he is continually cutting and wounding his own Con&s;cience, and if he be not quickly tran&s;lated out of this e&s;tate, he will quickly give him&s;elf the fatal blow. As long as any are enemies to God, they are al&s;o their own adver&s;aries; but when they leave off fighting again&s;t God, they cea&s;e warring again&s;t them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>Peace within is very comprehen&s;ive, &s;e|veral things are therein included.</P>
<P N="1">1. Peace within comprehends <HI>calmne&s;s in the Con&s;cience:</HI> This calmne&s;s follows upon the apprehen&s;ion and &s;en&s;e of our peace with God, and that now he is in his Son reconciled. A reproaching Con&s;cience is a fearful companion; we cannot fly away from Con&s;cience, it is always with us; if a|wakened 'twill &s;peak boldly, and tell us our own, be we never &s;o proud or high in the world, and the ear is forced to hear Con&s;ci|ence's accu&s;ations; when God gives it a command to &s;peak, how impo&s;&s;ible is it for us to impo&s;e &s;ilence on it? Oh what a &s;torm doth the remembrance of manifold &s;ins, with their manifold aggravations, rai&s;e in
<PB N="103" REF="003114_0054_0FEFA84D3AE0C4E8">
the Con&s;cience? how amazed is it to &s;ee &s;o much guilt, and God &s;o much and &s;o ju&s;tly incen&s;ed? But when God by his Spirit doth &s;ay, <HI>Soul, though &s;in hath abounded, my grace doth &s;uperabound; thy debts are all paid, thy ini|quities are all pardoned.</HI> Then the &s;torm cea|&s;es, and there follows a great calm; Then Con&s;cience lays a&s;ide the whip of &s;teel, wherewith before it la&s;h'd it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Con&s;cience acquits the &s;inner, becau&s;e God hath fir&s;t ju&s;tified and ab&s;olved him. Sins which are pa&s;t are remitted, and in&s;tead of continuing in &s;in, the heart is changed, and is &s;incerely de&s;irous to have it &s;lain; and this godly &s;incerity Con&s;cience gives te&s;timony to, the effect of which is peace and joy, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.12. <HI>Our rejoicing is this, the te&s;timony of our con&s;cience.</HI> Con&s;cience tells us of our duty, and urges us to the per|formance of it; now when Con&s;cience is heeded by us, and what we do for God our very hearts are in it, Con&s;cience will not condemn, but approve us, and this will qui|et us; for &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.20. <HI>Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Peace within comprehends <HI>&s;atisfaction in the heart. Solomon,</HI> while making trial what &s;ufficiency was in the things under the Sun, was far from peace within, vanity was
<PB N="104" REF="003114_0055_0FEFA85B00DF9260">
the fruit of all his labour, and his &s;pirit is &s;o far from being &s;atisfied, that 'twas filled with vexation. But when God doth give him&s;elf to us, whom our hearts mu&s;t then needs look upon as a proportionable happine&s;s, as a &s;ufficient portion, Oh then we are come to our centre, and are at re&s;t. When the Soul cea&s;es to tire and weary it &s;elf in pur&s;uing after the creatures, and is fixed upon God, who is a Sun, a Shield, an exceeding great Reward; who is the God of all grace, and calls us to eternal glory; who cannot only &s;atiate our de&s;ires, but do exceedingly above our de&s;ires and thoughts, according to that power which worketh in us, <HI>Eph.</HI> 3.20. Then, then our peace abounds, and pa&s;&s;es all under&s;tanding. The heart is exceedingly plea&s;ed with its choice, having made choice of God; it would not exchange conditions with the greate&s;t gracele&s;s ones in the whole world.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledg'd indeed, that in this only the back parts of the Lord <HI>Jehovah</HI> are &s;een, and little of him in compari&s;on is to be enjoyed: Yet this is certain, that <HI>Gods little</HI> is much more than the <HI>worlds all</HI>: The enjoyment of the Lord in part, affords more peace and &s;atisfaction, by ten thou&s;and de|grees, than the creatures are capable of yielding; and that &s;ati&s;faction, how much is
<PB N="105" REF="003114_0055_0FEFA85B00DF9260">
it heightned by the a&s;&s;ured hopes, that at la&s;t we &s;hall be fully &s;atisfied?</P>
<P N="3">3. Peace within comprehends <HI>an agreement in our wills to the will of God.</HI> 'Tis but rea|&s;on, that &s;ince Gods will is &s;o high, &s;o holy, &s;o good, our wills &s;hould &s;toop and &s;ubmit; and we cannot have peace but in that &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion. The carnal mind is enmity again&s;t God, and refu&s;es to be &s;ubject to the Law and Word of God: Nay, by that very Law the corrupted heart is irritated and provo|ked, 'tis the more forward to &s;in, becau&s;e forbidden to tran&s;gre&s;s: He was not unac|quainted with Man's nature, who &s;aid,
<Q>Nitimur in vetitum &s;emper, cupimu&s;&abque; ne|gata.</Q>
We are very prone to do that which is for|bidden, and to de&s;ire what is denied us: And while the heart is thus irritated by the Law, ala&s;s! the &s;inner is like the troubled &s;ea, when it cannot re&s;t: <HI>Sin taking occa&s;ion by the commandment, doth work all manner of con|cupi&s;cence,</HI> Rom. 7.8. But now what peace is there, when our hearts are reconciled to our duty, when we do not quarrel at, but love the Law, and wi&s;h, Oh that our ways were directed to keep it! How can there be peace within, unle&s;s there be &s;ome &s;uitable|ne&s;s

between our &s;pirits and Gods Word and Ordinances? unle&s;s what was before look'd upon, without cau&s;e, as a burthen and wea|rine&s;s, be now e&s;teem'd as a priviledge and advantage?</P>
<P N="4">4. Peace within comprehends <HI>ordinatene&s;s in the affections.</HI> Our pa&s;&s;ions and affections, being corrupted by &s;in, are very tumultuous and unruly; and except the&s;e are tamed and brought into right order, we &s;hall not know peace. Tho&s;e are &s;ome of the wor&s;t kind of &s;laves that are en&s;laved by their own affections. How is that Man hurried, who is under the power of worldly or unclean de&s;ires? His fle&s;hly and his worldly lu&s;ts do &s;o take up his time and pains, that they will not permit him to eat, or drink, or &s;leep, and much le&s;s pray in quiet. How is that heart rent and torn, that is by inordinate love glued to any creature, when of that creature 'tis deprived? Oh the overwhel|ming &s;orrow which follows upon love that is exce&s;&s;ive! What a rack and torture is an|ger? What an evil is fear? many times wor&s;e than the evil feared: And &s;o I might in&s;tance in other affections.</P>

<P>But 'tis the work of the Spirit of God to renew the&s;e affections; the anger and &s;orrow are turned again&s;t and on &s;in, the love and the de&s;ire are towards God: And as here there is no danger of exce&s;s, &s;o there is a certainty of enjoyment: The heart &s;its loo&s;e from the world, and the world is not able to di&s;turb that peace which it hath in God. None are more free from trouble than tho&s;e that are mo&s;t ma&s;ters of their own affections: And well may the Apo&s;tle &s;ay, that <HI>the fruit of the Spirit is peace and joy,</HI> Gal. 5.22. &s;ince he brings our affections in|to captivity.</P>
<P N="5">5. Peace within comprehends a <HI>cea&s;ing to be our own foes.</HI> When are we our own foes? Surely when we &s;ide with Satan again&s;t our &s;elves, when we cheri&s;h tho&s;e lu&s;ts that war again&s;t our own &s;ouls. The Vipers off &s;pring do eat out the Vipers bowels; and &s;inful lu&s;ts, in like manner, will de&s;troy at la&s;t tho&s;e in whom they are bred and fo&s;ter'd. Oh let us all be reconciled to our &s;elves, and not continue any longer the greate&s;t acce&s;&s;ories to our own mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>I have &s;hewed now what Peace is.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="003114_0057_0FEFA8423AF2D5E8">In the &s;econd place I am to manife&s;t what are the things which belong unto our peace.</P>
<P>'Tis in the Go&s;pel that the&s;e things are revealed, which therefore is called the Go&s;|pel of Peace, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.15. <HI>How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Go&s;pel of peace, and bring glad tiding of good things.</HI> Herein is contained an Emba&s;&s;age of re|conciliation: The God of peace proclaims to the world what an inclination he hath to be a friend and Saviour to the children of men, and informs them upon what ar|ticles a peace &s;hall be made and e&s;tabli&s;hed between him and them. The Law of Na|ture is here &s;ilent; the Heathens by the light of that could never find out the way, how Divine Ju&s;tice may be &s;atisfied, and an attonement for &s;in made. Nay, the writ|ten Law of God &s;peaks not a word con|cerning it: The Law teacheth our duty, convinceth of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, thunders out cur&s;es again&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, and they would be left under the cur&s;e, if the Go&s;pel did not tell them how to be redeemed from it, and how Grace, and Mercy, and Peace may be obtained.</P>
<P>There are three things which the Go&s;pel reveals concerning our peace.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Who is the Mediator or Peace-maker, Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="109" REF="003114_0057_0FEFA8423AF2D5E8">2. <HI>What are the conditions of this Peace.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>How we may attain to an a&s;&s;urance of it.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. One thing which we mu&s;t know con|cerning our peace is, <HI>Who is the Mediator or Peace-maker between God and man, and he is Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> I Tim, 2.5, 6. <HI>For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and man, the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, to be te&s;tified in due time.</HI> Here it was that <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> was ignorant; a crucified <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> (though his crucifixion was nece&s;&s;ary to his making of our peace) they hid their faces from, di&s;e&s;teemed. Chri&s;t crucified was to the <HI>Jews</HI> a &s;tumb|ling-block, and to the <HI>Greeks</HI> fooli&s;hne&s;s, but to them that are reconciled and &s;aved, he is the power of God, and the wi&s;dom of God: Hence 'tis that the Apo&s;tle re|&s;olves to know nothing be&s;ide him. All things that are revealed in Scripture mu&s;t be known with relation to Chri&s;t, el&s;e our knowledge will be uncomfortable and with|out advantage.</P>
<P>What good will it do us to hear that God is gracious and merciful, unle&s;s in Chri&s;t he be reconciled? what good, to be infor|med of heaven and glory, unle&s;s Chri&s;t, who hath the Key of <HI>David,</HI> do open the door that we may enter? What good, to hear of the Promi&s;e, unle&s;s in Chri&s;t
<PB N="110" REF="003114_0058_0FEF968D4D8E0C08">
they be Yea and Amen to the glory of God? Finally, what will it benefit us to hear of the priviledges of the Go&s;pel, un|le&s;s through Chri&s;t we are admitted to them? There is an excellency in the know|ledge of Chri&s;t our Peace-maker, in com|pari&s;on of which the Apo&s;tle counted all things but lo&s;s and dung, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.8.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t Je&s;us is our Peace maker by a threefold means. His <HI>Satisfaction,</HI> his <HI>In|terce&s;&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>the communication of his benefits.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Chri&s;t Je&s;us is our Peace-maker by <HI>means of his &s;atisfaction</HI>: For the iniquity of his people was he &s;mitten, and the cha&s;ti&s;e|ment of their peace was laid upon him: He was &s;ent on purpo&s;e to be a propitiati|on; 1 <HI>John</HI> 4 10. <HI>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and &s;ent his Son to be the propitiation for our &s;ins.</HI> Chri&s;t is &s;aid to reconcile both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> unto God, by the blood of his Cro&s;s, and to have &s;lain the enmity thereby. Cor|ruptible things, as &s;ilver and gold, were in|&s;ufficient, but the blood of Chri&s;t was a &s;uf|ficient price for our redemption.</P>
<P>We may conceive &s;uch a kind of dialogue as this, between Ju&s;tice, and Chri&s;t, and Man who hath offended.</P>
<P N="1">1. Divine Ju&s;tice thus begins: <HI>Bring forth the Soul which hath &s;inned that it may dye: A
<PB N="111" REF="003114_0058_0FEF968D4D8E0C08">
righteous Law hath been broken, and 'tis but righteous that the cur&s;e &s;hould be inflicted: Here are not one, or two, but thou&s;ands of &s;ins upon record: Now therefore I am re&s;olved to whet my glittering &s;word, and my hand &s;hall imme|diately take hold on vengeance, and I'll make the &s;inner know to his co&s;t, what 'tis to provoke the Lord to jealou&s;ie.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Chri&s;t an&s;wers; <HI>Hold Ju&s;tice, &s;tay thy hand! tho&s;e &s;ins thou &s;peake&s;t of, they are tran&s;|ferred unto another, therefore the Soul mu&s;t not dye that's guilty of them: The debt it great, but I undertake to pay it all; where thou art wronged, it &s;hall be put wholly on my account, I am re&s;olved to be the &s;inners Security, I am content to be made &s;in for him, though I knew none, though I never was my &s;elf in the lea&s;t guilty.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Unto this Ju&s;tice replies, <HI>Then, O thou Son of God, I mu&s;t &s;heath my &s;word in thy bowels, I mu&s;t wound, and brui&s;e, and afflict thee where ever I find &s;in, though but imputed, I can't forbear to puni&s;h it.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Chri&s;t an&s;wers again; <HI>Do Ju&s;tice, &s;trike, and &s;pare not; I am willing to be wound|ed, that the &s;inners wounds may be clo&s;ed and cured; I am willing to dye that he may live; I am willing to undergo the cur&s;e, that he may receive the ble&s;&s;ing, even life for evermore.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Upon this the &s;inner wonders and
<PB N="112" REF="003114_0059_0FEFA86239907728">
cries out, <HI>Oh love that pa&s;&s;eth knowledge! My Lord, my Saviour! &s;ince thou ha&s;t given thy life a ran&s;om for me, I am re&s;oled to tru&s;t in thee, and to lay the &s;tre&s;s of my &s;alvation no thee, I expect and de&s;ire favour and pardon no other way, than by thee, who art both the Price and the Prince of Peace.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Chri&s;t is our Peace-maker by <HI>means of his interce&s;&s;ion.</HI> As his &s;atisfaction is one, &s;o his interce&s;&s;ion is the other part of his Prie&s;t|ly office. He &s;econds his &s;ufferings by his interce&s;&s;ion; and we may be confident his interce&s;&s;ion will be prevalent, becau&s;e of that love which his Father bears him, and becau&s;e by his &s;ufferings he hath purcha&s;ed whatever he intercedes for. <HI>Chri&s;t the righ|teous is our Advocate with the Father,</HI> I John 2.1. He pre&s;ents before his Father the compleatne&s;s of his &s;atisfaction, and how he hath endured the Cro&s;s and &s;hame, and drank off that whole Cup which his Father put into his hand, and fulfilled all righte|ou&s;ne&s;s; how he did, and &s;uffered all that was required of him, and all this, not for him&s;elf, but us. Whereupon the Father looks upon us with an eye of love, he is pacified towards us; and as he is Chri&s;ts God and Father, &s;o he is ours too: <HI>John</HI> 20.17. <HI>Go tell my brethren, I a&s;cend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="113" REF="003114_0059_0FEFA86239907728">3. Chri&s;t is our Peace-maker <HI>by the com|munication of his benefits</HI>: He is made unto us wi&s;dom, and then we &s;ee the way of reconciliation: He is made unto us righte|ou&s;ne&s;s; &s;in is no longer imputed, and that quarrel which Ju&s;tice had with us comes to an end: He is made unto us &s;anctification, and then the holine&s;s of God cea&s;es to be our enemy, and we no longer hate that holine&s;s; there is a &s;weet agreement be|tween our renewed nature and an holy God, and his holy Law, which he would have us walk according to. They that are &s;anctified in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, love God be|cau&s;e of his holine&s;s, and they love the Word of God upon the &s;ame &s;core, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.139, 140. <HI>My zeal hath con&s;umed me, becau&s;e mine enemies have forgotten thy words: Thy Word is very pure, therefore thy &s;ervant loveth it.</HI> Finally, Chri&s;t is made unto us redemption, that's a fourth benefit reckoned up by the Apo&s;tle, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.30. He makes us free indeed, becau&s;e he frees us from that which is &s;lavery indeed, he delivers us from the bondage of corruption, and cau&s;es us to become the &s;ervants of God and righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6. And now we are recon|ciled to Gods Sovereignty and Authority, we own him as our Lord, who as he hath right to rule us, &s;o 'tis our honour, our ad|vancement,
<PB N="114" REF="003114_0060_0FEFA86BEE38B3E0">
out freedom to be ruled by him.</P>
<P N="2">2. As we mu&s;t know who is our Peace|maker, &s;o what are the conditions of our peace.</P>
<P N="1">1. One condition is <HI>godly &s;orrow:</HI> And as the Lord doth grant us peace, &s;o he him|&s;elf doth work this and the other conditions of it. If we will be reconciled, we mu&s;t mourn for our offending and provoking God to be an enemy. The eye of the bo|dy can look every way but inward, and &s;hall the eye of our mind never look in|ward neither? Were our hearts but more acquainted with them&s;elves, they would be more broken and contrite hearts: How deeply is the Law of &s;in engraven there? and this Law of &s;in forbids whatever the Law of God commands, and commands whatever the Law of God forbids. The mo&s;t venemous creature is not more full of poy&s;on, then our hearts are full of enmity again&s;t the Lord, and reprobatene&s;s to what is good: This corruption of our nature is not a thing which hath lain dorment and idle; no, but as a Fountain perpetually &s;ends forth water, &s;o from the heart pro|ceed evils abundantly, whereby the man is defiled. 'Tis difficult to reckon up the &s;ins of one day, or of one duty; and how va&s;t
<PB N="115" REF="003114_0060_0FEFA86BEE38B3E0">
then is the total &s;um of our whole lives a|bominations? Oh break hard heart for &s;hame! who ha&s;t &s;o often broken the mo&s;t equal laws, and broken thorow &s;o many obligations to obedience. If the offending God be made light of, this will anger him more than all thy other offences.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another condition of our Peace is <HI>Be|lieving.</HI> When the Jaylor was under the &s;en&s;e of Gods anger and wrath, and tor|tur'd with the fears of damnation, and cry'd out, <HI>What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved? Paul</HI> and <HI>Si|las</HI> made this an&s;wer, <HI>Believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and thou &s;halt be &s;aved,</HI> Acts 16.30, 31. How much is faith preached up in the Go&s;pel? and unto Chri&s;t our faith is directed, for 'tis in him that God is well plea&s;ed, and 'tis through that be|loved Son alone, that he will be at peace, and well plea&s;ed with us: If we expect favour or mercy any other way, but thro' Je&s;us, that very expectation is &s;ufficient to be an eternal impediment to our obtaining of either. The Lord hath made Faith one great condition of our peace and &s;alvation, for two rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1. Man being thus reconciled and &s;aved by believing, <HI>all the glory redounds to God a|lone:</HI> Mans boa&s;ting is utterly excluded: The hand of faith is an empty hand, it
<PB N="116" REF="003114_0061_0FEFA839AE068050">
brings nothing along with it; but it receives Chri&s;t, <HI>and with him, and for him, freely all things.</HI> Faith exalts Chri&s;t, and aba&s;es the &s;inner, and makes him &s;ee, that he is wretched, and mi&s;erable, and poor, and naked, and that to Chri&s;t he mu&s;t thank be be|holding for every thing, he mu&s;t thank him&s;elf for nothing.</P>
<P>Man being thus reconciled and &s;aved by believing, his peace with God is la&s;ting, his &s;alvation &s;ure, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.16. <HI>Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace, to the end the promi&s;e might be &s;ure. Adam</HI> was at peace with God when fir&s;t created; but &s;ince the continuance of peace depended upon the con&s;tancy of his obedience, peace and life were &s;oon lo&s;t by him. But faith puts our peace and &s;alvation in the hands of another, in the hands of Chri&s;t, he undertakes to be <HI>the fini&s;her of our faith,</HI> Heb. 12.2. He hath promi&s;ed to keep us from falling, and <HI>to confirm us to the end,</HI> 1 Cor. 1.8. And the believer re&s;ts upon this word of promi&s;e, which will never fail him.</P>
<P>That's the &s;econd condition of peace, be|lieving.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another condition is, <HI>Conver&s;ion with the whole heart to God.</HI> How often doth the Spirit cry out, <HI>Turn and live?</HI> And though the Lord was bitterly provoked, yet upon
<PB N="117" REF="003114_0061_0FEFA839AE068050">
his peoples returning, he promi&s;es to be pa|cified, <HI>Jer.</HI> 3.12. <HI>Go and proclaim the&s;e words towards the North, and &s;ay, Return thou back|&s;liding I&s;rael, &s;aith the Lord, and I will not cau&s;e my anger to fall upon you, for I am merci|ful, &s;aith the Lord, and I will not keep anger for ever.</HI> Our returning to him mu&s;t be without delay, without deceit; we mu&s;t not divide our hearts between him and &s;in, between him and Mammon, but we mu&s;t con&s;ent to be <HI>wholly his,</HI> and never to leave him any more; but if through infirmity we do fall, we mu&s;t look unto the Lord to pity, and pardon, and heal, and rai&s;e us. To turn away from God &s;o as not to re|turn, is incon&s;i&s;tent with peace. Thus you know the&s;e things, which are the conditi|ons of your peace; let me add, <HI>Happy are ye if ye do them.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. It concerns us to know, <HI>how we may attain to an a&s;&s;urance of Peace.</HI> The &s;oul in|deed may be &s;afe without this a&s;&s;urance, but withal 'twill be di&s;con&s;olate. Now 'tis the Spirit who makes this di&s;covery: We read, <HI>Rom.</HI> 14.17. <HI>of peace and joy in the ho|ly Gho&s;t.</HI> Peace and joy are the fruits of this ble&s;&s;ed Comforter. In Scripture the Saints are &s;aid to be <HI>&s;ealed by the Spirit unto the day of redemption,</HI> Ephe&s;. 4.30. And their being thus &s;ealed, as it denotes their
<PB N="118" REF="003114_0062_0FEFA8450A7D7878">
di&s;tinction from the re&s;t of the world, their being approprieted unto God, and the value that is put upon them; &s;o it &s;erves to confirm them in that pre&s;wa&s;ion, that God is their, and they are his. There is indeed a privy Seal of his gracious Decree, of which the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.29. <HI>Neverthele&s;s the foundation of God &s;tandeth &s;ure, having this &s;eal, the Lord Knoweth them that are his.</HI> But afterwards, when the Spirit works upon <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, we are &s;ealed in a more di&s;cernable way. Now the work and me|thod of the Spirit in &s;ealing and bringing tho&s;e, who are reconciled, unto an a&s;&s;u|rance of peace, I &s;hall declare.</P>
<P N="1">1. the Spirit convinces us to &s;in and mi|&s;ery of our worthle&s;ne&s;s and weakne&s;s, and bows our hearts to a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, and draws us to a clo|&s;ure with him.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Spirit &s;anctifies and clean&s;es us from the filthine&s;s, in which we wallowed, and cau&s;es us to yield obedience to the commands of God, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.27.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Spirit doth more and more &s;tir up and increa&s;e the grace which he hath wrought, &s;o that the actings of faith, and love, and hope, and zeal, are the more &s;trong and &s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="119" REF="003114_0062_0FEFA8450A7D7878">4. The Spirit doth di&s;cover the truth of the&s;e graces, leting us &s;ee, that our hearts do prize Chri&s;t, and breath after God, and after a greater degree of likene&s;s to him, as the Saints in Scripture have done before us.</P>
<P N="5">5. Then peace and joy follows. But here we mu&s;t under&s;tand, that this peace is twofold. Fir&s;t, more weak, mixed and im|perfect. Secondly, more ravi&s;hing, glori|ous and triumphant.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is a peace <HI>more weak, mixed and imperfect,</HI> which is for our &s;upport and en|couragement, and this is common with be|lievers, when they &s;tir up them&s;elves, and &s;eek the Lord with their whole de&s;ire, as they did, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 15.15. Seldom is a duty performed with our heart and might, but &s;ome degree of peace and &s;atisfaction fol|lows, the Spirit giving &s;ome intimation, and rai&s;ing a &s;ecret hope, that God through Chri&s;t doth accept of us. Oh who would not labour &s;ince there is &s;uch peace and re&s;t attends it?</P>
<P N="2">2. There is a peace <HI>more ravi&s;hing, glori|ous, and triumphing.</HI> How brightly doth the light of Gods countenance then &s;hine upon us! How &s;weet is that love, the &s;en&s;e of which the Spirit &s;heds abroad in the heart! <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.5. What confidence have we then in God! How do we admire the richne&s;s of
<PB N="120" REF="003114_0063_0FEFA83DB3939918">
his grace! how low are we in our own eyes, being a&s;toni&s;hed that &s;uch vile creatures &s;hould be &s;o advanced! How do we then de&s;pi&s;e the worlds delights, and the plea|&s;ures of &s;in! How forward are we to obey, and to walk in all Ordinances blamele&s;s! How undaunted at danger, and at death, which will but increa&s;e our plea&s;ures, &s;end|ing us much nearer to the Lord, than here we are capable of approaching! Thus 'tis by the Spirit that peace is &s;poken to us; and if we would attain to this peace, we mu&s;t heed the Spirits coun&s;els, we mu&s;t readily clo&s;e with his motions, we mu&s;t gladly ac|cept of his help and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, we mu&s;t give up our &s;elves unto his guidance.</P>
<P>In the third place follow the rea&s;ons of the Doctrine.</P>
<P>Why, to know the things of our peace is our great happine&s;s and wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons are the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e <HI>a true knowledge of the&s;e things will be practical and indu&s;trious</HI>; It will very much affect the heart, and quicken dili|gence, in &s;eeking peace before it be too late: A right under&s;tanding of it, will hin|der a bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;uch eternal con&s;equence, from being any longer neglected by us.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="121" REF="003114_0063_0FEFA83DB3939918">2. Becau&s;e <HI>of the evil which unavoidably follows, if of the things which concern our peace we are ignorant.</HI> The ignorant &s;oul is wret|chedly carele&s;s, it matters not whether God be a friend or foe; as if his loving kindne&s;s were not to be valued; as if his wrath were not to be feared; and at la&s;t, the &s;oul mi&s;&s;es of mercy, which it doth not regard, and falls &s;uddenly and irrecoverably into the pit of de&s;truction, which it dreams not of, nor endeavours to prevent.</P>
<P>Now follows the Application.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="application">
<HEAD><HI>USE I.</HI> Of In&s;truction.</HEAD>
<P>There are two great le&s;&s;ons which we may learn from this Doctrine.</P>
<P N="1">1. One le&s;&s;on is this, <HI>That believers are the wi&s;e&s;t and happie&s;t &s;ouls, for the things of their peace are under&s;tood by them.</HI> Tho&s;e things which are hid from the prudent of the world are unto the&s;e di&s;cover'd: I know they are accounted children and babes by the carnal|ly minded, but in the end they will be found to have had of all others the greate&s;t fore|&s;ight, the farthe&s;t reach, the true&s;t under|&s;tanding: <HI>Matth.</HI> 11.25, 26. <HI>At that time Je&s;us an&s;wered and &s;aid, I thank thee, O Fa|ther, Lord of heaven and earth, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t hid the&s;e things from the wi&s;e and prudent, and
<PB N="122" REF="003114_0064_0FEFA836F29BCF80">
ha&s;t revealed them unto babes; even &s;o Father, for &s;o it &s;eemed good in thy &s;ight.</HI></P>
<P>Peace is a thing which all &s;eek after, but mo&s;t are mi&s;taken in judging what is peace, and are wofully deceived in the way to it: Only the believer hits right, for he is led by a Guide that leads only into truth.</P>
<P>'Tis indeed found by experience, that en|deavours are u&s;ed to blind and deceive the believer him&s;elf; but he is too wi&s;e to be put off with peace and happine&s;s only in &s;hew.</P>
<P>Many things do proffer peace to him.</P>
<P N="1">1. Plea&s;ures do u&s;e this charming language. <HI>What is it, O Man, which thou &s;eeke&s;t for? Is it quiet and &s;atisfaction? Come ta&s;te the &s;weet|ne&s;s which gratifying thy &s;en&s;es will afford: Is it not fine to glitter in &s;ilk and &s;ilver bravely? to be clothed in purple and fine linen, and to fare &s;umptuou&s;ly and deliciou&s;ly every day? Who are more free from care and trouble, than tho&s;e who chaunt to the &s;ound of the viol, who drink wine in bowls, who eat lambs out of the flock, and calves out of the mid&s;t of the &s;tall, and after lay them down upon beds of Ivory, and &s;tretch them|&s;elves upon their couches? Come, come, away with needle&s;s &s;cruples, indulge unto thy appetite, plea&s;e thy &s;en&s;es, whatever thy eyes de&s;ire with|hold not from them, and quench thy longing flame in</HI> Dalilah's <HI>embraces.</HI></P>

<P>Unto this al&s;o the believing &s;oul an&s;wers: <HI>To expect peace and contentation from worldly a|bundance, is as ab&s;urd, as to hope to &s;leep quietly in a bed of thorns.

<P>O that you would be per&s;waded unto peace! Many arguments I may fill my mouth with, to prevail with you to he reconciled.</P>
<P N="1">1. Do but con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly, <HI>what kind of enemy the Lord is,</HI> and that con&s;ideration will make you afraid, that he &s;hould be your enemy any longer.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>You cannot fly from his reach.</HI> Though you exalt your &s;elves as the Eagle, though you &s;et your Ne&s;t among the Stars, yet from
<PB N="128" REF="003114_0067_0FEFA83337516850">
thence the Lord can bring you down, <HI>Obad.</HI> 4. Though you &s;hould go down to the bottom of the Sea, and hide your &s;elves at the earths centre, yet there his hand can take you. If you imagine that any refuge can &s;ecure you from God, that refuge will be found a lye, and will deceive you. The Lord does fill both heaven and earth, nay the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain him, how then is it po&s;&s;ible any &s;hould fly from him?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>You cannot re&s;i&s;t his power.</HI> Far &s;tronger creatures than you, were not able to with|&s;tand the God of heaven: The Dragon fought and his Angels, but how ea&s;ily were they overcome? After that <HI>Jehu</HI> had &s;lain <HI>Joram</HI> and <HI>Ahaziah,</HI> the Kings of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and <HI>Judah,</HI> we read that the Elders of <HI>Samaria were exceedingly afraid, and &s;aid, behold two Kings &s;tood not before him, how then &s;hall we &s;tand?</HI> 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 10.4. So may I &s;ay, Be|hold the Angels that excel in &s;trength, &s;tood not before the Lord, he ca&s;t them, when they &s;inned, into chains, which they can never bread a&s;under; And how then &s;hall man be able to &s;tand, who dwelleth in a hou&s;e of clay, who&s;e foundation is in the du&s;t, and who is cru&s;hed before the moth? Sinner! God will certainty be too hard for thee, thou can&s;t no more re&s;i&s;t his

power, than a feather can bear up again&s;t a whirlwind, or dried &s;tubble defend it &s;elf from the fierce&s;t flame.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>You cannot bear his indignation.</HI> How doth <HI>David</HI> faint end cry out, when a lit|tle of Gods anger was &s;tirred up again&s;t him? <HI>Remove thy &s;troak away from we, I am con&s;umed by the blow of thy hand, P&s;al.</HI> 39.10. And if a little be &s;o intollerable, what will the whole weight be? The Prophet brings in the un&s;en&s;ible creatures, as if they had &s;en&s;e, fearing and quaking, when the Lord doth &s;hew his wrath, <HI>Nehem.</HI> 1.5, 6. <HI>The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burnt at his pre&s;ence, yea, the world and all that dwell therein; who can &s;tand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierce|ne&s;s of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.</HI> Sure|ly that heart is wor&s;e than rocky, which doth not tremble before him.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>He can engage all the creatures again&s;t you.</HI> He is the Maker and al&s;o the great Commander of the Ho&s;t of Heaven and Earth. The Angels are ready pre&s;s'd for his &s;ervice, and to do his will; all the De|vils are at his beck, and forward to be the Executioners, when he hath pa&s;s'd an an|gry &s;entence: The Thunder and the Light|ning &s;ay unto him, <HI>Here we are</HI>: The &s;tor|my

<P N="5">5. He hath acce&s;s unto your very &s;pirits, and can wound and fill your &s;ouls with horror. When the Lord impre&s;&s;ed his anger upon the heart of <HI>Judas,</HI> how re&s;tle&s;s was he? though a covetous man, he flings away his &s;ilver, <HI>that</HI> would not ea&s;e him: his life is a burthen, and with his own hands he puts an end to it. <HI>A wounded &s;pirit who can bear</HI>? and wounds <HI>there</HI> the Lord can give you.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>His power will reach his enemies in the next world:</HI> Nay, then his hand will be hea|vie&s;t of all; God will lay on load upon his adver&s;aries, and not in the lea&s;t &s;pare them: His patience will then be at an end, his goodne&s;s totally and eternally withdrawn; and how low then will his vengeance weigh them down? Such an enemy the Lord is, and this is one argument to per&s;wade you to peace.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Be mindful of the dependance you have upon him.</HI> In him you live, and move, and have your being, and if he &s;hould withdraw his vi&s;itation, your life would pre&s;ently con|clude and vani&s;h: And is it &s;afe, or a wi&s;e

part in you, to provoke that God to be your enemy, in who&s;e hand your breath is, and who can take it out of your no&s;trils when he plea&s;eth? He can loo&s;e the &s;ilver cord, he can break the golden bowl, and require your &s;ouls at your hands, without giving you an hours or a minutes warning. Who&s;oever you fall out with, methinks you &s;hould get and keep in with God, for 'tis his patience and mercy which keeps you out of the grave and hell; of both which, by rea&s;on of &s;in, you are in great danger.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The conde&s;cen&s;ion and &s;tooping of God is admirably great, in be&s;eeching &s;uch as you to be reconciled:</HI> And &s;hall he intreat in vain?

That is a text that &s;hould work upon the mo&s;t refractory, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.20. <HI>Now then we are Emba&s;&s;adors for Chri&s;t, as though God did be&s;eech you by us, we pray you, in Chri&s;t</HI>'s <HI>&s;tead, be ye reconciled to God.</HI> What is it come to this, doth God be&s;eech, and Chri&s;t pray, that we, who are &s;o mean and &s;o vile, would be friends, and &s;hall we continue rebels? <HI>O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord!</HI> for the im|penitent, than the earth or &s;tones, are much more &s;tupid. To &s;light the proffer of mer|cy, and to di&s;obey the command to come for it, is both a fault and a folly inexcu&s;a|ble;
<PB N="132" REF="003114_0069_0FEFA82F2FE14748">
but to be deaf to intreaties, is wor&s;t of all; this goes neare&s;t unto God when his conde&s;cen&s;ion and kindne&s;e is di&s;regard|ed and abu&s;ed, and upon this abu&s;e the greater contempt, and anger, and hatred mu&s;t needs follow.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Con&s;ider what kind of friend the Lord is:</HI> I might be large in de&s;cribing his excel|lencies, which they who are acquainted with him &s;ee and admire. Three things at pre&s;ent I &s;hall mention.</P>
<P N="1">1. God is &s;uch a friend, <HI>who&s;e love is tran|&s;cendent.</HI> That &s;weet name (which is as an oyntment poured forth) he calls him&s;elf by, <HI>The God of love and peace,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.11. Nay, he is &s;tiled <HI>Love</HI> in the ab&s;tract, 1 <HI>John</HI> 4.8. <HI>He that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love.</HI> Whatever returns of love we make, tho&s;e returns fall infinitely &s;hort of the love of God from whence they come. Indeed it is as po&s;&s;ible to equal him in &s;trength, in wi&s;dom, or any other of his perfections, as to equal him in love. Oh let this love of God be as a load&s;tone to draw yours, and as a whet&s;tone to &s;har|pen it.</P>
<P N="2">2. God is &s;uch a friend, <HI>who&s;e fulne&s;s can never he exhau&s;ted.</HI> The Sun, although it hath &s;hined ever &s;ince the Creation, yet 'tis as full of light as ever it was. And tho'
<PB N="133" REF="003114_0069_0FEFA82F2FE14748">
the Lord hath &s;upplyed the wants of all them, whom he hath made his friends from the beinning, yet his &s;tock and &s;tore is not at all dimini&s;hed; His wi&s;dom is never po|&s;ed in their greate&s;t difficulties; when be|lievers know not what to do, and their eyes are unto him, he knows what to do for them: His power can rai&s;e them out of the lowe&s;t deep; his all-&s;ufficiency can give to the uttermo&s;t of their de&s;ires, nay ex|ceedingly more than it hath entred into their hearts to de&s;ire or conceive: Who in his wits would not leave a vain world, and de|ceitful lu&s;ts, to come to &s;uch a friend as God hath always &s;hewed him&s;elf to be?</P>
<P N="3">3. God is &s;uch a friend, <HI>as will la&s;t when all other friends fail.</HI> He is the Lord who changes not: He can as &s;oon cea&s;e to be, as cea&s;e to be faithful; and the faithfulne&s;s of God towards his friends, will make them al&s;o faithful; he will not turn away from them, and he will hold them fa&s;t that they &s;hall not depart from him. The Lord is mo&s;t con&s;tant; the Ordinances of the Sun, and Moon, and Stars are not &s;o immutable as the Promi&s;es he hath made. <HI>Men of low degree are vanity, men of high degree are a lye, P&s;al.</HI> 62.9.

<PB N="134" REF="003114_0070_0FEF96930506D1C8">
may fail, but the Lord will be a friend and a portion for ever. Oh con&s;ent to be reconci|led, &s;ince &s;uch a friend hereby will be gained.</P>
<P N="5">5. Con&s;ider, <HI>If God be at peace with you, he will &s;hield you from all other adver&s;aries</HI>; he will wre&s;t tho&s;e weapons out of your own hands, whereby you endeavoured your own de&s;truc|tion; he will give a deaths wound to &s;in, that it &s;hall not be your death. And though the world, and the God of the world, fight a|gain&s;t you, they &s;hall not be able to prevail: Nay, their very enmity &s;hall befriend you, <HI>and God will turn to good what they do mean for evil.</HI> 'Tis admirable to con&s;ider, how the ad|ver&s;aries of the Lords people, though they have the <HI>inten&s;ion</HI> of enemies, yet are forced to <HI>act</HI> like friends, and do a kindne&s;s unto Saints by tho&s;e means, whereby they thought to have injured and de&s;troyed them. Ju&s;t as <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s brethren, when they would hinder his promotion, &s;old their brother into <HI>Egypt,</HI> where he arrived to that honour, which be|ing foretold was the matter of their envy.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Gods late di&s;pen&s;ations, in a way of judg|ment, do call upon you aloud to &s;ue for peace.</HI> He hath di&s;played his Flag of Defiance, and the Motto of it hath been, <HI>Pe&s;te, Ferro, &amp; Flam|ma, By Plague, and Sword, and Fire</HI>; By all the&s;e the Lord hath been fighting with us and our &s;ins, and rebelling again&s;t him is the
<PB N="135" REF="003114_0070_0FEF96930506D1C8">
ground of the quarrel. The Sword was drawn, which devoured fle&s;h, and dyed red the Sea with blood. The Quiver was opened, and out flew the Arrows of the Pe&s;tilence; and what &s;laughter did tho&s;e Arrows make? Heaps upon heaps the De&s;troyer kill'd, many thou&s;and went down to the Cham|bers of Death. We were ready to conclude, when the Plague was over, that God had done with us, but we were mi&s;taken: A Fire was kindled in his wrath, which the &s;trong|e&s;t, the &s;tatelie&s;t buildings could not &s;tand a|gain&s;t: How did the flames roar? what ha|vock did they make? In three days &s;pace, <HI>London</HI> was no more like it &s;elf, than the dead bones, which have lay'n in the grave for &s;everal years, are like unto the Man, when he was alive, and in his greate&s;t &s;trength and beauty.</P>
<P>When the&s;e effects of his di&s;plea&s;ure are look'd upon with a con&s;iderate eye, who can doubt that God was angry? and how little hath been done to appea&s;e his wrath? 'Tis high time to beg for mercy, and to abandon whatever is a bar in Mercy's way. Oh that <HI>London,</HI> Oh that <HI>England,</HI> would know the things that belong to their peace! We are not brought &s;o low but we may be brought lower, if we provoke the Lord to continue &s;till an enemy.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="136" REF="003114_0071_0FEF969164931920">7. Con&s;ider, <HI>as yet there is a po&s;&s;ibility of be|ing reconciled ot God:</HI> His Arms are open and &s;tretched forth, if you will but ca&s;t your &s;elves into them: If the mo&s;t wicked will but for&s;ake their ways and thoughts, and return to the Lord, he will have mercy upon them; and though &s;in hath abounded, he will abun|dantly pardon, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 55.7.

<P>I hope by this time your ears will be rea|dily open to hearken to &s;ome Direction&punc; now you may have your peace with God made.</P>

But the Lord is ju&s;tly an enemy to you, be|cau&s;e your tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions again&s;t him have been &s;o many and &s;o mighty. That you &s;hould have hearts alienated from &s;uch a God, &s;o holy and gracious, and to whom you owe all that you are and have, it &s;hould make your hearts break and melt within you; and that you have engaged this God again&s;t you, &s;hould be e&s;teemed an evil and a bitter thing, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.19.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let your cries be &s;trong for peace</HI>: Re&s;olve never to give over, till he whom you have provoked to be your enemy, is become your friend.

to per&s;wade believers to endeavour after an a&s;&s;urance of peace.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;igns are the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>True peace follows after contrition and trouble for &s;in.</HI> Thou art at peace; but wa&s;t thou ever troubled? if not, 'twere well if thy peace were gone, and trouble in the room of it. Thou art troubled at thy tem|poral lo&s;&s;es, and when thy expectation from the creatures is fru&s;trated; affliction al&s;o is trouble&s;om, and acknowledg'd an e|vil, but were thine eyes open to &s;ee the e|vil of &s;in? was thy heart ever troubled for it? If guilt be made light of, if future pu|ni&s;hment be not thought on, nor feared, if thou art un&s;en&s;ible that &s;in is a plague, and 'tis not noy&s;om to thee, if thy offending of God be the &s;male&s;t matter of a thou&s;and, as long as thou feele&s;t nothing of his hand, certainly thou waft never broken, and &s;o thy peace is not thy priviledge, but thy pu|ni&s;hment. Chri&s;t <HI>was annointed to bind up the broken-hearted, and to comfort tho&s;e who fir&s;t have mourned, I&s;ai.</HI> 61.1. and tho&s;e who have true re&s;t given them, were fir&s;t weary and heavy laden.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>True peace is the fruit of the lips.</HI> I&s;ai. 57.9. <HI>I create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near.</HI> Peace is called the fruit of the lips,
<PB N="142" REF="003114_0074_0FEF969861E41A08">
partly becau&s;e 'tis grounded upon the Go&s;|pel which is preached to us: Where true peace is, there hath been a crying and lift|ing up the voice for it. Oh what importu|nities have been u&s;ed, that the Lord would cea&s;e to be an adver&s;ary? what wre&s;tlings for his favour and friend&s;hip? This peace hath been valued above all the world, and the &s;oul hath been contented to do any thing, to be any thing, &s;o it may be at peace with God.</P>
<P>True peace is likewi&s;e grounded upon the word; 'tis a peace not of our own, but of the Lords &s;peaking, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 85.8. <HI>I will hear what God the Lord will &s;peak, for he will &s;peak peace to his people, and to his Saints, but let them not turn again to folly.</HI> And when he &s;peaks peace, who then can make trou|ble? The word di&s;covers the marks and cha|racters of &s;uch as are indeed reconciled unto God, and become his children; that they prize the Lord Je&s;us above all, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.7. that they hunger and thir&s;t af|ter holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.6. that they love and fear, and are de&s;irous to follow their Father, <HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> 5.1. And the Spirit by the Word doth work the&s;e graci|ous qualities and inclinations in our hearts, and di&s;covers that he hath wrought them; and &s;o we come to conclude that we are in|deed reconciled.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="143" REF="003114_0074_0FEF969861E41A08">3. <HI>True peace is joyned with the &s;piritual combat.</HI> The Spirit lu&s;ts again&s;t the fle&s;h in all tho&s;e who are reconciled unto God. There is a war with &s;in where-ever there is a peace with God. If any of our lu&s;ts, which are both the Lords enemies and our own too, are winked at, and provi&s;ion is made for them that they may be fulfilled, we plainly &s;hew we are &s;till alienated from him. But if the remainders of corruption, if that evil which is pre&s;ent with us, be our burthen, and makes us cry out, <HI>O wretched as we are, Rom.</HI> 7.24. and we would e&s;teem it one of the greate&s;t happine&s;&s;es, to be ea|&s;ed of that &s;in that dwells in us, this &s;hews evidently, <HI>that with our minds we &s;erve the Law of God, that we are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and there is no condemnation to us, Rom.</HI> 6, 25: and 8.1.</P>
<P>I grant, that in a wicked man there may be a combat between his will and his con|&s;cience: Con&s;cience may check and re|proach him, for what his will hath a &s;trong propen&s;ion towards. But the combat be|tween the fle&s;h and the Spirit is another thing: Here the very heart and will is re|newed, holine&s;s is longed after, &s;in, not only becau&s;e of its guilt, but becau&s;e of its filth, a burthen; and the heart is de&s;irous that con&s;cience were more awakened, that
<PB N="144" REF="003114_0075_0FEFA83183BB7990">
it might exerci&s;e greater power, and cau&s;e a greater re&s;traint from what is evil; where|as the de&s;ire of unrenewed ones is, that con&s;cience, when troubled, may be hu&s;ht a&s;leep, that &s;o &s;in may be committed with|out any remor&s;e.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>True peace is incon&s;i&s;tent with carele&s;s walking.</HI> A Child of God, who hath at|tained unto peace, if he grows loo&s;e, and begins to live at random, pre&s;ently his peace withers, and con&s;cience grudges and is un|&s;atisfied, e&s;pecially if temptation to &s;in, that hath no more of pre&s;umption, doth prevail. Can&s;t thou omit thy duty? can&s;t thou be proud and peri&s;h? can&s;t thou be exce&s;&s;ive in thy recreations? can&s;t thou be unwatch|ful over thy heart, and words, and ways, and yet thy peace not at all abate? A&s;&s;ure thy &s;elf thy peace is but a meer delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The quicknings of the Spirit may be without the comforts, but never the com|forts without the quicknings. If thou grie|ve&s;t the Spirit by thy lukewarmne&s;s and for|mality to withdraw his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and to leave thee under deadne&s;s, and thy peace &s;till remains, that peace is not the Spirits fruit, but thy own hearts pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>Thus of the &s;igns of peace.</P>
<P>Now follows the arguments to per&s;wade unto endeavours after a&s;&s;urance that your peace is made.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="145" REF="003114_0075_0FEFA83183BB7990">1. <HI>A&s;&s;urance of peace will inflame your hearts with love.</HI> How will the fire kindle, and your hearts burn within you, when you percieve, that you, even you in particular, have an intere&s;t in that love which pa&s;&s;es knowledge? that God hath had thoughts of kindne&s;s and mercy towards you, before the foundation of the world was laid, and that as his love is from everla&s;ting, &s;o to evrla&s;t|la&s;ting it will endure? 1 <HI>John</HI> 4.19. <HI>We love him,</HI> &s;ayes the Apo&s;tle, <HI>becau&s;e he fir&s;t loved us.</HI> And this manife&s;tation and &s;en&s;e of the love of God will have the greater influence, becau&s;e it u&s;ually finds us in &s;orrow, doubt|ing whether ever favour will be extended towards &s;uch as we, fearing we are ca&s;t-a-ways. Now when in this doleful darkne&s;s the light of Gods countenance is lifted up, and he &s;hews his reconciled face, oh how do our affections work towards him! The Prodigal, who came home with a &s;ad and doubtful mind, when he found him&s;elf in his Fathers armes, when he &s;aw that &s;o long ab&s;ence and great exorbitancies had not ex|tingui&s;h'd his Fathers love, &s;urely the work|ings of his love towards his Father again were beyond expre&s;&s;ion.</P>

Well may your hearts rejoyce, and your joy no man taketh from you. This joy is not like that of the carnal and ungodly, 'tis built up|on a &s;urer foundation, affliction cannot damp it, and the thoughts of death and judgment, which quite &s;poil the mirth of the wicked, will but highten and increa&s;e it, it being an earne&s;t of that fulne&s;s of joy, which after di&s;&s;olution will be entred into.</P>
<P N="3">3&punc; A&s;&s;urance of peace <HI>will mightily engage you unto thankfulne&s;s.</HI> This is one rea&s;on cer|tainly, why <HI>David</HI> is called a man after the heart of God, becau&s;e he was &s;o much in prai&s;e.

Unbelieving doubts and fears cau&s;e us to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a dumb devil, &s;o that though our receipts are va&s;t, our returns, are &s;mall: We mi&s;con&s;true mer|cies, and &s;ay, they are common to hypo|crites, and that they are given in anger to us, and will &s;erve only to increa&s;e both our

But when we know that our peace is made, we &s;hall al&s;o know our intere&s;t in tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings which are peculiar to Gods cho&s;en ones; and as for outward mercies, they will be very much &s;weetned, becau&s;e coming not only from the hand, but from the heart of God; and hereupon we &s;hall be the more forward <HI>to offer the &s;acrifice of prai&s;e to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name,</HI> Heb. 13.15.</P>
<P N="4">4. A&s;&s;urance of peace <HI>will quicken you to du|ty, &amp; make you &s;tedfa&s;t in obedience.</HI> With what forwardne&s;s will you pray, when you know you &s;hall be heard? with what willingne&s;s will you engage in other Ordinance, when you know that God will meet with you in them? When you attend upon the mini&s;try of the Word, the Lord him&s;elf hath engaged to be your in&s;tructer; when you come to the table, he will certainly make you welcome, and will be, not only the inviter, but the fea&s;t likewi&s;e. Your expectations may be ju&s;tly rai&s;ed, and you &s;hall not be a&s;hamed of them. What encouragement doth this afford? And al&s;o, when you know that you are reconciled to God, and have a &s;ight and ta&s;te how good and gracious he is, you will cleave to him with the fuller purpo&s;e of heart; you will find &s;o much &s;weetne&s;s in him, that all the delights of &s;in and the world, which Satan doth &s;o

<P N="19">19. Live as Strangers and Pilgrims; look upon the World as your Inn, and Heaven as your Home, and act as within view of Death, and Judgment, and Eternity.</P>
<P N="20">20. At evening reflect how you have &s;pent the day. An Heathen of old gave this nota|ble advice,
<Q><L>Never let &s;leep, which &s;en&s;es tyes,</L>
<L>At any night clo&s;e up thine eyes,</L>
<L>Before the actions of the day</L>
<L>Thou thrice and &s;eriou&s;ly doe&s;t weigh;</L>
<L>Where have I &s;inn'd? what have I done?</L>
<L>What duty have I let alone?</L></Q></P>
<P>If you would walk after this manner, how perfect might your peace be? and how much might your pa&s;&s;age be &s;weetned through his vale of tears?</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="003114_0080_0FEFA8492DF32348">I have done with the third Doctrine: I &s;hall be very brief in the two which remain.</P>
<P><HI>Doct.</HI> 4. The fourth Doctrine is this, <HI>That when &s;inners will not &s;ee, they are &s;mitten many times with &s;piritual blindne&s;s, and the things of their peace are in a way of judgment bid from them.</HI></P>
<P>The Lord hides the things of their peace from them &s;everal ways.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>He cau&s;es his Spirit to withdraw</HI>: 'Tis the Spirits work to enlighten dark under|&s;tandings; but if the Spirit be gone, how great mu&s;t the darkne&s;s be?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Lord gives Men up to the perver&s;e rea&s;onings and coun&s;els of their own hearts</HI>; and then a thou&s;and ab&s;urdities will, by the car|nal mind, be imagined in the doctrine which is according to godline&s;s; and how bur|then&s;ome will the practi&s;e of godline&s;s be made to appear?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Lord permits Satan to blind them</HI>; and by his means their hatred of light, and of the works of light, is very much augmented; and hereupon, either more abominable prophanene&s;s, or &s;trong delu&s;ions follow.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The Lord in his providence cau&s;es &s;everal things to happen,</HI> which &s;inners &s;tumble at, and by which they are more confirmed in their prejudices again&s;t the Word, and in their infidelity. The righteous are &s;uf|fer'd &s;ometimes to fall into &s;in, and many times into great di&s;tre&s;s: The wicked often pro&s;per in the world, and live and dye in a fal&s;e peace: And upon this the ungodly are more darkned and hardned.</P>
<P N="5">5. In all this the Lord acts as a Judge, and intends to puni&s;h their refu&s;ing to be enlightned, and yet he
<PB N="155" REF="003114_0080_0FEFA8492DF32348">
is not the Author of &s;in: <HI>He is light,</HI> 1 <HI>John</HI> 1.5. and no darkne&s;s can come from him. All ignorance and mi&s;take is from corrupted nature, being wrought upon by the Prince of darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>Neither is the ju&s;tice of God to be quarrelled at for dealing thus with them that reject illumination.</P>
<P N="1">1. The merit of their &s;in is great. <HI>Ne&s;cire e&s;t igno|rantis nolle &s;cire e&s;t &s;uperbiae</HI>; there is abundance of pride in them that are unwilling to be informed, and a great love to evil deeds, and al&s;o mighty ingratitude, for light is a very great priviledge.</P>
<P N="2">2. This puni&s;hment is very &s;uitable; What more equal, than that tho&s;e, who would not be enlightned by the Spirit of the Lord, and directed into the paths of peace, &s;hould be &s;uffered to be beguiled by Satan and their own &s;pirits, and &s;o be mi&s;guided and lo&s;t for ever?</P>
<P><HI>U&s;e</HI> 1. Take heed of &s;inning again&s;t the light, for fear it be put out in ob&s;curity. The clearer the light &s;hines, the more it aggravates the works of darkne&s;s. Let not the lu&s;ts of your hearts be cheri&s;hed and fulfil|led, le&s;t the light of your heads be hereby extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P><HI>U&s;e</HI> 2. Do not unwarrantably &s;urmi&s;e, that the things of your peace are in judgment hid from you. All blindne&s;s is not judicial. If thou would&s;t fain know the will of God and do it, God upon thy <HI>asking will give wi&s;dom liberally without upbraiding, Jam.</HI> 1. He will not fail by his Spirit to in&s;truct thee, who hath made thee thus willing to be in&s;tructed.</P>
<P><HI>Doct</HI> 5. The la&s;t Doctrine follows, <HI>When &s;ouls are left under darkne&s;s, their &s;tate is wretched and deplorable.</HI></P>
<P>Con&s;ider, with &s;uch</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>God is extreamly angry.</HI> When he puni&s;heth &s;in with &s;in he is mo&s;t of all di&s;plea&s;ed; and truly he cannot puni&s;h it with a wor&s;e evil than it &s;elf is. In temporal judgments, 'tis to be hoped, the Lord aims at our reformation and amendment; but when he gives up any to blindne&s;s of mind, and a reprobate &s;en&s;e, 'tis a &s;ign his love and mercy have done with
<PB N="156" REF="003114_0081_0FEFA865112A97A0">
them. As by the Spirit of God believers are &s;ealed up to the day of redemption, &s;o by the &s;pirit of &s;lumber the unbelievers are &s;ealed up to the day of de&s;truction.</P>
<P N="2">2. With &s;uch Satan doth what he plea&s;es; he leads them along. and how little do they perceive whither they are going? how do means make them wor&s;e? how bold are they in &s;in? how quickly are they like to fill up the mea&s;ure of their iniquity, and grow rotten ripe for vengeance? and when that vengeance overtakes them, then they will weep over them&s;elves, as Chri&s;t doth over <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and too late lament their own mi&s;ery, when 'twill be impo&s;&s;ible to have it removed.</P>
<P><HI>U&s;e</HI> 1. Earne&s;tly intreat, that this may never be yours, which which was the puni&s;hnent of <HI>Jeru&s;alem:</HI> And if you would not lye under the like plague, you mu&s;t not be guilty of the like &s;in, namely, rejecting Chri&s;t, end the Go&s;pel of peace.</P>
<P><HI>U&s;e</HI> 2. Pity tho&s;e who tread in <HI>Jeru&s;alems</HI> &s;teps, and provoke the Lord to clo&s;e their eyes; tell them of their danger, which they them&s;elves do not per|ceive; awaken them out of their Lethargis, if it be po&s;&s;ible, before it become pa&s;t remedy.</P>
<P><HI>U&s;e</HI> 3. If the Lord, when others are blinded, is be|come both light and &s;alvation to any of you, break out into prai&s;e. The light is marvellous which you are called to, and marvellous &s;hould be your joy. You have that eye-&s;alve, with which few eyes are anointed, you have that Spirit which the world doth not receive. You were born blind as well as others, but a miracle of grace hath been wrought upon you; the vail is taken off, and you &s;ee the Lord, and your intere&s;t in him, how &s;hould all that is within you ble&s;s him? This pre&s;ent light, where|with you are vi&s;ited, is, as it were the dawning of the day of glory, and a certain forerunner of the light that's everla&s;ting.</P>
