<P>ON Friday la&s;t came on before a &s;pecial court of Oyer and Ter|miner, the trial of David M'Lean for high trea&s;on; the indictment was o|pened by Mr. Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on, and the ca&s;e &s;tated by the Attorney General. Af|ter the evidence for the crown was clo&s;ed, the pri&s;oner de&s;ired to be heard in his own defence&mdash;which was granted. He began by thanking the court for the indulgence he had re|ceived, and after a &s;hort addre&s;s to the Jury on the &s;ubject of his inno|cence, he turned round and began to harrangue the audience; hereupon he was interrupted by the Chief Ju&s;|tice who informed him that a patient hearing &s;hould be given to whatever he might have to urge, but that it &s;hould be addre&s;&s;ed to the court or jury, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s.

Mr. Pyke and Mr. Franklyn, who had been a&s;&s;igned, were then heard for the pri&s;oner; but they cal|led for no witne&s;&s;es. The Attorney General made a very able reply, in which he commented on the pri&s;oner's indi&s;cretion in attempting his own defence, and clearly refuted all the pretexts he had &s;et up, to the convic|tion of every body. The evidence was then &s;ummed up by the Chief Ju&s;tice, who ob&s;erved, that mo&s;t of the overt acts charged, which were fourteen in number had been proved by three or four witne&s;&s;es; many of whom (which was rarely the ca&s;e in pro&s;ecutions of

The pri&s;oner was again a&s;ked if he had any thing further to &s;ay, and an&s;wer|ing nothing, the Chief Ju&s;tice pro|ceeded to give &s;entence, as nearly as we could collect it, to the following effect:</P>
