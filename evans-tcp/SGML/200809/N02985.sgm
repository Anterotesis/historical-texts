<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear and intirely beloved Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is an afflicting Providence from God, and ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Shame to me <HI>(for I cannot clear my &s;elf from a great deal of ju&s;t Blame</HI>) that I have not done, nor can now do any Thing for you in Regard of tho&s;e Writings you de&s;ired of me: I have, and am continually pre&s;&s;ed with Variety of urgent Occa&s;ions, and much Time (<HI>in the Way I am in</HI>) is daily taken up from my per&s;onal Studies, be&s;ides many incident Avoca|tions. And alas! I can do little, and make but &s;low Progre&s;s in the long Race of Learning I have to run! And it is my mi&s;erable Gui&s;e, either by Wickedne&s;s or Weakne&s;s, to fall &s;hort of that Good I &s;hould either get or do; and if it be &s;o in this Ca&s;e towards you, it is no Wonder, tho' it &s;hould be my deep Sorrow! But yet con&s;ider|ing &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages in your la&s;t and former Letters concerning your &s;piritual Condition, and know|ing by Experience in my &s;elf, the Reality of &s;uch Complaints; I would not be &s;o gracele&s;s as to neglect you wholly therein. And tho' I can &s;ay or do very little, yet a Word or two might be of &s;ome U&s;e; nor do I know what Guilt might lie upon me, if I &s;hould be &s;ilent or &s;light in this Ca&s;e! And therefore (<HI>Dear</HI> &mdash;) if my barren Heart would &s;uffer me, I would pre&s;ent you with a few Words, as if you and I were alone in a Corner, in the Pre&s;ence of God!</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="003575_0003_0FF82F680ECF2728">The Condition you expre&s;s, is the common (<HI>but fearful</HI>) Epidemical Calamity of tho&s;e Times and Places where the Go&s;pel is preached, and among &s;uch as outwardly carry fair: Convinced, but not humbled; &s;ome Apprehen&s;ions of Mi|&s;ery and Affections now and then, but not deep effectual Mournings; &s;omething burdened with Sin and Mi&s;ery, and Wrath of God; but yet able to bear it, and contented to live, without being delivered from it: Knowing every Thing and feeling nothing; or rather knowing every Thing, and yet indeed knowing nothing; in &s;eeing not, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For my own Part, it is that which hath been the baneful Mi&s;ery of my Soul (<HI>even that very Thing which you &s;ay and mean</HI>) ever &s;ince I knew any Thing; and the Lord knows how little I am delivered from it, and how much of my Work in this Point (<HI>upon which the very Hinges of our Salvation turn</HI>) is yet to do to this Day! Oh <HI>(my</HI> &mdash;) if my Heart were not Adamant, I &s;hould weep with and for you: And truly when I am mo&s;t near God, I have no greater Reque&s;t than this for my &s;elf and you, that God would u&s;e any Means to make us &s;ee Things really as they are, and pound our Hearts all to Pieces, and make indeed Sin mo&s;t bitter, and Chri&s;t mo&s;t &s;weet, that we might be both humbled, and comforted to Purpo&s;e! An im|perfect Work of the Law, and then an imper|fect Work of the Go&s;pel is the Bane and Ruin of us in the&s;e Days! Some Fears and Affecti|ons, and then &s;ome Hopes of Mercy <HI>(without finding full Re&s;t and Satisfaction in Chri&s;t only</HI>)
<PB N="4" REF="003575_0004_0FF82F699E04B910">
Men re&s;t in, and here peri&s;h! But hence is the Ground of that you &s;peak of&punc; An Heart that doth not, cannot feel Sin, (<HI>and con&s;equently, no other Thing that God's Word &s;peaks of)</HI> and the Wrath of God for it, to purpo&s;e; cannot be &s;en&s;ible of Sin or Mi&s;ery in an effectual Manner! Now a Word or two of Coun&s;el to you in this Ca&s;e!</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> Con&s;ider the End and Things you are to &s;trive after. <HI>Secondly,</HI> The Way and Manner how: Your Bu&s;ine&s;s is never to re&s;t till you come to feel Sin as an in&s;upportable Burden, and then to find Re&s;t and everla&s;ting Satisfaction in Chri&s;t, imbracing him as your own! To go on humbling to be humbled, and to &s;ee &s;uch intolerable Evil in Sin; and to be &s;o burdened with the Wrath of God lying upon you for it, as it may make Sin everla&s;tingly odious to you, and force you to fly for Refuge to lay hold of the Hope &s;et before you; and to have &s;trong Con&s;olation there! This is a great Thing, not ea&s;ily and quickly gotten: But &s;it not down at Quiet, till you come to this! This is the Way to make all &s;ure. But you will &s;ay I know not whether I ever had any true Hu|miliation; whether there is any Thing in me that will &s;tand by me, when an Hour of Temptation comes! Therefore now re&s;olve, I will padle and dally with God and my own Soul no longer, I will never give God re&s;t till he &s;hew me Things really, and till I have attained that Sen&s;e of Sin, and Faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, which is real and effec|tual! This is the Work of our Lives, <HI>Joh.</HI> 6.29. Let me never re&s;t till it be put out of all Doubt,
<PB N="5" REF="003575_0005_0FF82F6BC19B31A0">
that God in Chri&s;t is mine own, and hath made an everla&s;ting Covenant with me! This I will have, or I will be in Bitterne&s;s before the Lord while I have any Being; and for the Re&s;idue of my Days, I will dwell with them that lie down in Sorrow, I will have my Society with &s;uch for&s;aken Souls; who being de&s;olate and de&s;erted, are free among the Dead: If the ble&s;&s;ed God &s;hall excom|municate this wretched Soul from his gracious Pre&s;ence, <HI>(which yet is but an Act of his mo&s;t holy and ju&s;t Severity.)</HI> O! let me find this Favour in his Sight, that I may al&s;o excommunicate my &s;elf from the Plea&s;ures and Enjoyments of this pre&s;ent World! And re&s;olve this, If God will not me &s;ee the Good of his Cho&s;en, (<HI>and I have nothing to &s;ay why he &s;hould.)</HI> I will mourn, I will mourn; let me live &amp; dye in the Hou&s;e of Mour|ning! If God will not Comfort me, nothing el&s;e &s;hall; if I may not have Peace and Re&s;t in God. I'll have none at all; if God will take no Plea|&s;ure in me; I'll take no Plea&s;ure in my&s;elf: Let my Tears be my Meat continually; let me go mourning up and down the World while I <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> a Day to live: If God ca&s;t me off, let this be my Condition! Nay, (<HI>come to this Pa&s;s</HI>) I <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> not live, unle&s;s God be reconciled to me: My Spirit fails, if the Lord redeem not pre&s;ently. There is no Being, no Biding for me, unle&s;s he &s;peak a Word of Peace to me. (<HI>P&s;al.</HI> 69.2, 3, 17, 18. and 143.4, 7.) And in a Time of Need God will help; when you are lo&s;t, God will find you, when you are &s;ick to Death, he will heal you, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 57.16, 28, 29. His Bowels will yearn

towards you! Never fear want of Con&s;olation, if your Humiliation be not ineffectual! And here let me warn you of a Thing or two!</P>
<P>Take heed le&s;t &s;ome le&s;&s;er Sorrows and Affec|tions heal and ea&s;e you, and &s;o you be kept from great and effectual Sorrows and from Comfort by Chri&s;t only! Many a one &s;ees him&s;elf in a mi&s;e|rable Condition; hereupon he goes alone, he prays (<HI>and weeps too it may be</HI>) very affectionately for Mercy: Upon this he grows well and whole again! His good Affections plea&s;e him, and heal him; tho' he be indeed &s;till as far from Chri&s;t and grounded Comfort as ever! Take Heed of this: As al&s;o &s;econdly, Of re&s;ting in &s;ome Hopes of Mercy, or in &s;ome Ta&s;tes of Mercy! Many Things give a Man a good Hope that God may &s;ave him, and the Words of Comfort are &s;ome|times &s;weet and refre&s;hing to his Heart; this quiets him: He hath enough now, he runs away with this, when as Chri&s;t him&s;elf is not yet his; nor is he &s;atisfied with him only! Many peri&s;h here; not but that the&s;e Affections and Hopes are very good, and they may be true, <HI>(and be &s;ure to be exceeding thankful for any &s;uch Thing; that you have any De&s;ire to &s;eek God, any Tears at any Time before him, and Hope toward him; it's more than Thou&s;ands have)</HI> and very good Encourage|ment to &s;eek after Chri&s;t more; but not to be re&s;ted in without Chri&s;t. It's a Sign a Man's Heart is fal&s;e when a little of any thing will &s;erve him! U&s;e tho&s;e Sorrows, Heart-breakings and Hopes, as ble&s;&s;ed Encouragements and Engage|ments to follow on &s;till, and get nearer to Chri&s;t,
<PB N="7" REF="003575_0007_0FF82F7004E382B8">
and to gain in upon him; but re&s;t not till you be &s;ure you have Chri&s;t; and fully re&s;t in him, and your Heart live upon him only, alone, wholly and always! Now for the Way you are to take in the Ca&s;e, owned and expre&s;&s;ed by your&s;elf, I would add a little as the Lord &s;hall help.</P>
<P>Do not &s;ay there is no Hope, and &s;o give over &s;triving! Give not Way to a &s;ullen De&s;perate|ne&s;s and Deadne&s;s of Heart; to a dulled, &s;unk, di&s;couraged Spirit, as if it were in vain to &s;tir, and will never be better with you! Do not &s;ay, Thus it hath been, and thus it is, and you cannot help it, and there leave it! No, no, <HI>Ari&s;e and be doing, and God will be with you</HI>; is an old Rule! Whatever your Ca&s;e be, never be <HI>di&s;cou|raged:</HI> Be humble and afflicted under Sin and Mi&s;ery, (<HI>the more the better</HI>) but never be <HI>di&s;cou|raged!</HI> Re&s;olve, I will yet follow God for all this, come on me what will! See 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 12.20. Know that God is God, and not Man, he <HI>can</HI> help, nay he <HI>will!</HI> He is willing to help you, if you be not unwilling to have it: See <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 55.8. <HI>Jer.</HI> 33.3. <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 13.9. <HI>Joh.</HI> 4.10. and 6.36. He hath after Mercies for them that have abu&s;ed former Mercies, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 39.26. <HI>Jer.</HI> 3.1, 22. If it were but a <HI>may be, Amos</HI> 5.15. <HI>Zeph.</HI> 2.3. A <HI>who can tell? Jon.</HI> 3.9. <HI>Joel</HI> 2.14. A <HI>Lord, if thou wilt,</HI> Mat. 8.2. It's enough to make us follow after God to the la&s;t Ga&s;p! Secondly, Look up to the infinite God to help you for his Name &s;ake, and for the Lord Je&s;us &s;ake. You know you are mi&s;erable, and have un&s;peakable Need of his Help; tho' you do not feel it, and
<PB N="8" REF="003575_0008_0FF82F7217EC9688">
be not affected with it. Upon this Ground <HI>(and this is Ground enough</HI>) go to God and tell him, that the le&s;s Sen&s;e you have, the greater is your Mi&s;ery, and the more Need you have of his Help: None but God can pull you out of this Pit, can inlighten this Darkne&s;s, and break this Adamant; to him therefore you come according to his own Coun&s;el, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.18. Tell him, He knows you and &s;ees you, tho' you do not know or &s;ee him, no, nor your &s;elf neither: He can take hold of you, tho' you cannot take hold of him, <HI>Joh.</HI> 15.16. Bring &s;uch an Heart as you have <HI>(longing that it were better</HI>) to him, that he would mend it: Bewail this impenitent Heart, cry out of this &s;ecure &s;otti&s;h Heart, as the greate&s;t Evil that could befal you; be&s;eech him to u&s;e any Means to break it and change it: Fill your Mouth with Arguments before him; tell him of his free, (<HI>Oh hang there upon free Mercy</HI>) his tender, his preventing, his manifold rich Mercy: Say you are re&s;olved never to leave him till he give you this Grace effectually, and all the Grace you want, everla&s;ting Mercy: Cry to him out of the thick Darkne&s;s, and out of the low Dun|geon, <HI>Lam.</HI> 3.55. When you have no Mind to pray, when Devil and World, when Heart and the Gates of Hell are again&s;t you: Yet then, even then, pray in Spite of all your &s;piritual Ad|ver&s;aries: Offer Violence to the Kingdom of Heaven, &s;tir up your &s;elf to take hold on God; lay hold on Eternal Life, when nothing but Dark|ne&s;s and Death is about you; when God &s;tops his Ear again&s;t you, and &s;huts up his Heart too;
<PB N="9" REF="003575_0009_0FF82F7428A11F80">
yet then fall down before him, put your Mouth in the Du&s;t; judge and loath your &s;elf, hate your Sin, that brought you to this Pa&s;s: Look again toward him, (as <HI>Jon.</HI> 2.4, 7.) clo&s;e with him at and upon the Sword's Point, (<HI>tho' he kill</HI> me, <HI>yet will I tru&s;t in him.</HI>) Ble&s;s his Name and &s;ay as <HI>Lam.</HI> 3.21. Chatter before him; leave your &s;elf to his Mercy, to his ab&s;olute, &s;overeign, meer Mercy, renouncing all other Props &amp; Comforts: See <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 50.10. Tell him as <HI>Dan.</HI> 9.9. re&s;olve to follow him, tho' blindfold, and &s;ee <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.32, 33. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.22. When you are &s;hut up under Sin and Unbelief, then look to him who is able to &s;ave to the utmo&s;t them that come to God by him: You know not how to look to him, nor what it is to believe, nor how to go about &s;uch a Thing; therefore tell God that you come to him for Faith, as well as other Things. You want every Thing, &amp; you come for every Thing: (<HI>the poore&s;t Creature that lives)</HI> and know that the ble&s;&s;ed God would have you come to him in Chri&s;t for every Thing: Chri&s;t hath all Power in his Hands to help you, <HI>Joh.</HI> 17.2. and &s;ee <HI>Joh.</HI> 6.37. Thirdly, continue in &s;eeking God till you find him: <HI>Follow on to know the Lord</HI>; and then be your Ca&s;e what it will, you &s;hall know him, <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 6.2. <HI>Col.</HI> 4.2. <HI>Luk.</HI> 18.1. Many are very &s;erious and earne&s;t for a Fit; but they give over before the Lord come, and will rather patch up their Comfort and Salvation of any Fa&s;hion, than take the Pains to hold out in &s;eeking God with all their Might: Multitudes peri&s;h here. Oh! look to this; for do not think (<HI>e&s;pe|cially
<PB N="10" REF="003575_0010_0FF82F7672364B38">
in the Ca&s;e you are in</HI>) to get Grace &amp; Chri&s;t (<HI>in the Sen&s;e before &s;poken of)</HI> pre&s;ently! No, no, God may make you &s;eek and wait many a Day; but you &s;hall reap in due Time if you faint not, <HI>Gal.</HI> 6.9. Diligently therefore and con&s;tantly attend and improve all the Ordinances and Op|portunites that God gives: In &s;pecial, let me &s;peak a Word or two for your better Help in them, <HI>(being more private and per&s;onal)</HI> viz.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>Meditation (a mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and effectual Thing which few Practice:</HI>) Get a little Time to meditate daily, laying a&s;ide other Things, and in other Occa&s;ions too, think as much of &s;piritual Things as you can: We do not &s;ee nor feel be|cau&s;e we do not think of Things; think of God and of Chri&s;t, of Sin, of Heaven, of Hell, of Judgment, of Eternity, how few &s;hall be &s;aved, how nece&s;&s;ary it is to take the pre&s;ent Time: What we come into the World for; of quick|ning Pa&s;&s;ages in Scripture, of God's Dealings with you, of your former Life and pre&s;ent Con|dition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But you will &s;ay, my Heart is &s;o vain and &s;tupid, I cannot think of Things. I an&s;wer, Fir&s;t, Let this deeply humble you; and the Vilene&s;s of your Heart that here di&s;covers it &s;elf will be worth the while. Secondly, be&s;eech God to help you. Thirdly, By u&s;e of Time you will find it more ea&s;y. Fourthly, Take Advan|tage upon all the evil Frames that at pre&s;ent you feel, to apply and &s;et on &s;ome &s;oaking Expre&s;&s;ion in Scripture: As in Ca&s;e of Hardne&s;s, Blindne&s;s, Vanity, &s;ee <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.18. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.4. <HI>Prov.</HI> 10.20. Yea, hence &s;ee and &s;ay, that God is true, and his
<PB N="11" REF="003575_0011_0FF82F780A8B7E50">
Word is true; for the Scripture tells me of this Heart I feel; and the re&s;t of it will be verified upon me as well as this. Fifthly, Take the Ad|vantage of &s;pecial Sea&s;ons for Meditation, when your Heart is in a feeling Frame (<HI>as after Prayer, after Sermon, if you cannot before</HI>) and lay up what you get: One Truth felt in Meditation, is worth a World, and it will make Way for more. Sixthly, Do &s;omething that is equivalent and helping to it, at lea&s;t when you cannot &s;o directly meditate: as reading of a good Book, writing of your former and pre&s;ent Life: (<HI>that is a Thing of endle&s;s U&s;e)</HI> gathering up God's Mercies, &amp; your Sins, in writing &s;ometimes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Prayer,</HI> this is the ble&s;&s;ed Means of getting a poor Soul to Heaven: And what an Happine&s;s is it, that we may pray to God! Be|&s;ides Family Prayer, get &s;ome Time for &s;ecret Prayer, daily le&s;s or more: Be telling God your Heart alone; I know your Occa&s;ions &amp; Labours (<HI>the Lord break my Heart for you</HI>) would not afford you that Liberty that I (<HI>Wretch</HI>) have: But do what you can; love the Duty, and God will pity you, wherein you are ju&s;tly and by his Providence (<HI>not your own Negligence</HI>) hindred. And this is cer|tain, he that hath an Heart, &s;hall never want Time nor Place to pray! Endeavour to order your Mat|ter &s;o, as you may have Time for it: And if you could weekly have a Piece of an Afternoon (<HI>as Saturday in the Afternoon an Hour or two or as God guides</HI>) &s;et a part for &s;ecret &amp; clo&s;e conver&s;e with God by Meditation &amp; Prayer, thinking, writing, reading, examining, mourning before God; and
<PB N="12" REF="003575_0012_0FF82F7A268E6C20">
do this con&s;tantly, you will never repent it: The Bu&s;ine&s;s of Salvation is mainly carrried on in &s;e|cret between God and a Man's own Soul: And by all Means provide, that you may have your Sabbaths as free as po&s;&s;ible all the Day, and the Evening before and after, for &s;piritual Work: Ply God in &s;uch Sea&s;ons as the&s;e be, and be very thankful if you <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">et but any little Ground of your Corruptions and Mi&s;eries: Go about your law|ful Occa&s;ions, not as a Liberty to the Fle&s;h, <HI>(as to think that now my Ta&s;k of praying is over, now I may plea&s;e my &s;elf &amp; refre&s;h my Heart in the World,</HI> &amp;c.) but as the Service of God, and as unto him, becau&s;e he bids you be thus employed; as when he bids me pray, I will pray with all my Might; &s;o I will work too, when he bids me work; and not do it to plea&s;e my&s;elf (<HI>alas, if I con&s;ider it, what Plea&s;ure or Comfort is there in this evil World</HI>) but to plea&s;e him I will bu&s;y and employ my &s;elf in this World, (<HI>becau&s;e he bids me</HI>) but my Place and my Re&s;t &s;hall be only in God, or no where: As Seamen go to Sea, but build their Hou&s;es on Land; &s;o I'll go into the World, but lay up my Heart and Comfort and my whole Support in God! I will live <HI>in</HI> the World, but not <HI>upon</HI> it; I will live only upon God, &amp; have my Portion in him. And do not think that this Sorrow &amp; Sen&s;e of Sin, &amp; mourning after God, &s;tands in a monki&s;h drooping Sullenne&s;s and Sadne&s;s, (<HI>tho' it's certain that by the Sadne&s;s of the Countenance the Heart is made better; and one &s;hould not give him&s;elf to unnece&s;|&s;ary Mirth, which is very poy&s;onful; nor purpo&s;ely choak his &s;piritual Sorrows with temporal Delights:</HI>)
<PB N="13" REF="003575_0013_0FF82F7C2910F468">
But when you have &s;eriou&s;ly &s;pent your Time with God, and have left your Heart with him, and he calls you to your Occa&s;ions; go about them with Alacrity and Chearfulne&s;s, &s;o as you may di&s;patch them comfortably; and carry amiably and delightfully to tho&s;e about you. And let your Sorrows &amp; Sen&s;e of your Soul's Mi&s;eries lie deep and undermo&s;t, &s;o as you may recall them in their Sea&s;on; when you come to pray, or be alone with God again! Labour to have a con&s;tant ha|bitual feeling of your &s;elf, (<HI>and get as many good Thoughts and Affections as you can, at all Times)</HI> &s;o as it may be livelily, actual, e&s;pecially in your Sea&s;ons of attending upon God; and in them drive on the Bu&s;ine&s;s of your Soul, as if there were nothing el&s;e to be minded but that. And if you find your Heart gone when the Sea&s;on of &s;eeking God comes, then know that you have in &s;ome Mea&s;ure back&s;lidden and for&s;aken God; and never leave till you have recovered it. Re|call and review often the chief Sins of your Life that you can remember; confe&s;s and aggravate them before God in a &s;pecial Manner, <HI>(but have your Times of confe&s;&s;ing and bewailing all the Sins that ever you can remember</HI>) and think of what Sins or Cour&s;e it was that cau&s;ed God to leave you to this woful Impenitency of Heart, &amp; bewail them bitterly. One thing more I mu&s;t add; Do not think it much to have &s;ome &s;pecial Sea&s;ons of &s;eeking God, be&s;ides tho&s;e I have named. If you had a Friend with whom you might now &amp; then &s;pend a little Time, in conferring together, in opening your Hearts, and pre&s;enting your unut|terable
<PB N="14" REF="003575_0014_0FF82F7E47E6A8C8">
Groanings before God, it would be of excellent U&s;e: Such an one would greatly &s;trength|en, be&s;tead, and further you in your Way to Hea|ven. Spend now and then (<HI>as Occa&s;ions permit)</HI> an Hour (<HI>or &s;o)</HI> with &s;uch a Friend more than ordinary <HI>(&s;ometimes a Piece of a Day, &s;ometimes a whole Day of extraordinary Fa&s;t, in &s;triving and wre&s;tling with God for everla&s;ting Mercy.</HI>) And be much in quickning Conference, giving and taking mutual Encouragements &amp; Directions in the Matters of Heaven! Oh! the Life of God that falls into the Hearts of the Godly, in and by gracious heavenly Conference. Be open hearted one to another, and &s;tand one for another again&s;t the Devil and all his Angels. Make it thus your Bu&s;ine&s;s in the&s;e and &s;uch like Ways, to provide for Eternity <HI>while it is called to Day; looking unto Je&s;us the Author and Fini&s;her of your Faith.</HI> But you will &s;ay (<HI>it may be</HI>) and I &s;peak but what I have found in my own Heart: (<HI>Dear &mdash; I deal plainly with you, as I know you would have me do, and therefore let me &s;uppo&s;e it &s;hould be &s;aid</HI>) This is a tedious and hard Ta&s;k, and my Heart likes not to be &s;o yoaked and toiled in &s;uch Things? I can take no Plea&s;ure therein; and if I force my &s;elf to it for a while, yet it would &s;oon weary me: I have no Heart to the&s;e Things; it may be &s;omething might be done in this Way, or another might do &s;omething; but I have no Heart to it.</P>
<P>An&s;. 1. <HI>Wonder not at this, nor think the wor&s;e of that Cour&s;e, becau&s;e your Heart lu&s;teth again&s;t it; but think the better of it.</HI> For, the better any
<PB N="15" REF="003575_0015_0FF82F80B300E668">
Thing is, and the more in&s;trumental for our Sal|vation, the more it is oppo&s;ed by our vile Hearts, which are Enemies to God, and con&s;equently to our own chief Good.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Confe&s;s to God this Naughtine&s;s of your Heart:</HI> Be&s;eech him to help you again&s;t&punc; this Devil, to change your Nature, and let this occa&s;ion you to &s;ee, and loath the Wickedne&s;s of your Nature, and be enraged again&s;t it. <HI>The Spirit that dwel|leth in us lu&s;teth unto Envy, but he giveth more Grace</HI>; Jam. 4.5, 6.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Con&s;ider what is the Rea&s;on why this Way &s;eems &s;o irk&s;ome and tedious, and you have no Heart to it?</HI> Is it not becau&s;e of inward Blindne&s;s and Security? becau&s;e you &s;ee not Things as they be, nor the Weight and Worth of them? It is an irk&s;ome Thing to a Man to ri&s;e out of his Bed in the Night, when he lies warm, &amp; knows no Danger, nor urgent Occa&s;ion to ri&s;e; but if he awake, and &s;ee his Hou&s;e on Fire about his Ears, he will make no Demur about the Matter, but be glad he may ri&s;e! Verily, one real Glimp&s;e of the Wrath of God burning about us, or of <HI>Eternity</HI> that is a coming; one real Glimp&s;e of God's Anger (<HI>lying upon our Souls</HI>) which is in|finitely above the mo&s;t awful Apprehen&s;ion of Man or Angel; Oh! this would make us &s;kip at a Time to <HI>pray</HI> in, at an Hour to cry out to God for <HI>Mercy</HI> in, e&s;pecially if we might do it with any Hope of being heard and &s;aved, as now we may. So the Rea&s;on why I have no Heart to this Cour&s;e, is not becau&s;e there is Want of Rea&s;on to per&s;wade me, but becau&s;e I am blind;
<PB N="16" REF="003575_0016_0FF82F82B60FB0F0">
and I feel my Blindne&s;s, I know that I do not &s;ee Things as they be, and therefore I have good Rea&s;on to be deaf, to the Coun&s;el of mine own blind ignorant Heart, and to &s;trive by all Means to &s;ee better; and in the mean Time to believe what I do not &s;ee.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Offer Violence therefore to the Kingdom of Heaven, and be re&s;olved in this Point:</HI> Let my Heart &s;ay what it will, let Hell and World be a|gain&s;t me; my God I mu&s;t have! my God I will have! I mu&s;t get Sight of Sin, and Faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us? I mu&s;t make my Salvation &s;ure, or el&s;e I am undone for ever; and therefore pray I will, and follow God I will, in De&s;pite of the Devil: Unto him will I look and (<HI>in &s;uch a Cau&s;e as this)</HI> on him will I wait, who giveth the &s;ame Spirit of Zeal, of Indignation again&s;t Sin &amp; Self, as &s;ome|times was in holy <HI>Samuel,</HI> when he hewed <HI>Agag</HI> in Pieces before the Lord in <HI>Gilgal.</HI> Lord, thou ha&s;t commanded me to <HI>&s;eek thy Face, and thy Face will I &s;eek:</HI> I will not confer with Fle&s;h and Blood; I will not con&s;ult with carnal Rea&s;on; but what God bids me do, that will I do, and do it with all my Might.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Know that if you con&s;cionably attend upon God, he will by Degrees make it &s;weet and ea&s;y to you: He will &s;trengthen your Heart and Hands in your Way and Work,</HI> I&s;a. 40.31. You will find it a &s;weet and ble&s;&s;ed Thing to &s;tand confe&s;&s;ing your Sins before God, and emptying your Heart in his Sight, opening all your Complaints and Soul Concernments to him: You will find it an Happine&s;s that you may pray to the God of Hea|ven,
<PB N="17" REF="003575_0017_0FF82F84D39C4380">
and have any Communion with him. Our wicked Hearts make religious Duties irk&s;ome; el&s;e they are in them&s;elves the &s;weete&s;t Things in the World: Oh! if ever we come to know God aright, we &s;hall account it our Happine&s;s that we may do any thing in Way of Service to him, and Communion with him.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Salvation is worth all our Labour, he it what it will:</HI> Is it a Trifle to be &s;aved eternally? Do we think to get to Heaven by a good Wi&s;h? Or to go thither in a Feather-Bed? No, God will make us &s;trive, and &s;weat, and wre&s;tle for it: and be &s;ure it will quit the Co&s;t! It will never repent us of any Prayer we have made, or Tear we have wept, when we come there! Oh! fol|low not the Gui&s;e of this &s;ecure World, that (<HI>in the&s;e Days</HI>) is ca&s;t into a dead Sleep: Many profe&s;s, but few know what it is to work out their own Salvation with Fear and Trembling&punc; It is another Matter to be a Chri&s;tian indeed than mo&s;t make of it: And of tho&s;e that are &s;incere and lively, you &s;ee but their dark Side, you know not what they are in &s;ecret: Follow not Exam|ple, but follow the Word of God.</P>
<P>Thus I have given you the Sum of my Tho'ts, according to my Mea&s;ure and Manner. I be|&s;eech you to make &s;ome U&s;e of this poor Letter, and read it at &s;uch Times as may mo&s;t &s;uit you: You may have many Doubts &amp; Difficulties that I do not here touch; but &s;eek God, and he will guide you. As for your outward Condition, follow on in the&s;e Things, and your Trouble for Sin and Soul Mi&s;ery will &s;wallow up all other

<P>Now the tender Mercies of God be with you (<HI>Dear</HI> &mdash;) and the Lord lead you by the Hand to his eternal Re&s;t, through all Sins and Sorrows, to his own Glory, and your everla&s;ting Com|fort; &s;o I remain,</P>

<HEAD>A Copy of an excellent LETTER wrote by the Rev. Mr. <HI>John Eliot</HI> of <HI>Guilford,</HI> decea&s;ed, to his Brother Mr. <HI>Benjamin Eliot</HI> of <HI>Roxbury.</HI> <LB>Carefully corrected from <HI>Five</HI> &s;everal <HI>Manu|&s;cripts:</HI> By THOMAS PRINCE. <LB>Being an An&s;wer to this Que&s;tion, <HI>How to live in this World, &s;o as to live in Heaven.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR BROTHER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOurs I received, and thought on. The Que&s;tion, is, <HI>How &s;o to live in this World, as yet to live in Heaven?</HI> It is one of the common Places of my Heart that I have often Occa&s;ion to &s;tudy, and therefore takes me not unprovided. It is hard to keep the Helm up a|mong &s;o many cro&s;s Winds and Edyes, and Out-Land and boarding of Creatures, as we meet withal upon this Sea of Gla&s;s and Fire. And truly that Man knoweth not his own Heart who finds it not difficult to break through the Entan|glements of the World. Creature <HI>Smiles</HI> &s;top and intice away the Affections from JESUS CHRSIT: Creature <HI>Frowns</HI> encompa&s;s and tempe&s;tuate the Spirit, that it thinks it doth well to be angry: Both Ways Grace is a loo&s;er. We had all Need to watch and pray, le&s;t we en|ter into the&s;e Temptations. The greate&s;t of

your Conflicts &amp; Cau&s;es of your Complaints, &s;eem here to have their Original. Temptations fol|low Tempers. As there are <HI>two</HI> predominant Qualities in the Temper of every Body; &s;o there are <HI>two</HI> predominant Sins in the Temper of every Heart: And <HI>Pride is one</HI> in all Men in the World: the <HI>other</HI> is <HI>Care</HI> about <HI>Futurities.</HI></P>
<P>I will tell you familiarly what GOD hath done for my Soul, and in what Tract my Soul keeps to|wards him&s;elf. (1) I am come to a Conclu&s;ion to look for no great Matters in the World; but to know JESUS CHRIST and him crucified. I make be&s;t Way <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> low Gale. A high Spirit and a high Sail together will be dangerous: and therefore I prepare to live low. I de&s;ire not much, I pray again&s;t it. My Study is my Call|ing: &s;o much as to attend that, without Di&s;trac|tion, I am bound to plead for; and more I de|&s;ire not. By my &s;ecluded Retirements, I have Advantage to ob&s;erve how every Day's Occa&s;ions in&s;en&s;ibly wear off the Heart from GOD, and bury it in it &s;elf; which they that ever live in the Noi&s;e and Lumber of the World, cannot be &s;en&s;ible of. (2) I have learned to &s;ee a Need of every Thing GOD gives me; and to need nothing that he denies me. There is no Di&s;pen&s;ation, though cro&s;s and afflictive, but either <HI>in</HI> it or <HI>after</HI> it, I find I could not be without it: And nothing that I am without, whether it be taken from me, or not given to me; but &s;ooner or later GOD quiets me in him&s;elf without me. (3) I ca&s;t all my Care on the LORD, and live &s;e|curity on the Wi&s;dom and Care of my heavenly
<PB N="21" REF="003575_0021_0FF82F8DC1864A10">
Father. My Ways are you know, in &s;ome Sen&s;e hedged up with Thorns, and grow darker and darker daily; but yet I mi&s;tru&s;t not my good GOD in the lea&s;t; and live more quiet in the Ab&s;ence of all by Faith, than I &s;hould do, I am per&s;uaded, if I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them. I think the LORD deals kindly with me, to make me <HI>believe</HI> for all my Mercies, before I have them: they will then be <HI>I&s;aac's,</HI> Sons of Laughter. For the le&s;s <HI>Rea|&s;on</HI> hath to Work upon, the more freely <HI>Faith</HI> ca&s;ts it &s;elf on the Faithfulne&s;s of GOD. I find that while Faith is &s;teady, nothing can di&s;quiet me; and when Faith totters, nothing can e&s;ta|bli&s;h me. If I ramble out among Means and Creatures, I am pre&s;ently lo&s;t, and can come to no End: But if I &s;tay my &s;elf on GOD, and leave him to work in his own Way and Time, I am at re&s;t, and can lie down and &s;leep in a Promi&s;e, tho' a Thou&s;and ri&s;e up again&s;t me. Therefore my Way is not to ca&s;t before Hand, but to work with GOD by the Day. Sufficient to the Day is the Work thereof. I find &s;o much to do con|tinually with my Calling and my Heart, that I have no Time to puzzle my &s;elf with Per-adven|tures and Futurities.</P>
<P>As for the State of the Times, it is very gloomy and tempe&s;tuous: But why do the Heathen Rage? Faith lies at Anchor in the mid&s;t of the Waves, and believes the Accompli&s;hment of the Promi&s;e, thro' all the&s;e Overturnings, Confu&s;ions, and &s;eeming Impo&s;&s;ibilities. Upon this GOD do I live, who is our GOD for ever, and will guide us to the Death. Methinks I lie becalm'd in
<PB N="22" REF="003575_0022_0FF82F8FC933AEB0">
his Bo&s;om, as <HI>Luther</HI> in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, I am not much troubled; let CHRIST &s;ee to it. I know Prophecies are now dark, the Books are &s;ealed, and Men have all been deceived, &amp; every Vi&s;ion fails: yet GOD doth continue faithful: it's he that promi&s;eth, who will al&s;o do it. I believe the&s;e dark Times are the Womb of a bright Morning.</P>
<P>Many Things more I might have added; but enough. O! Brother, keep clo&s;e to GOD; and then you need fear nothing. Maintain &s;ecret and intimate Acquaintance with him; and then a little of the Creature will go a great Way. Take Time for Duties in private. Croud not Religion into a Corner of the Day. There is a <HI>Dutch</HI> Proverb, <HI>No body will get by thieving, or loo&s;e by praying.</HI> Lay up all your Good in GOD; &s;o as to over-ballance the Sweetne&s;s and Bitterne&s;s of all Creatures. Spend no Time in fore-hand Con|trivances for this World: they never &s;ucceed: God will run his Di&s;pen&s;ations another Way. Self-Contrivances are the Effects of Unbelief: I can &s;peak by Experience. Would Men &s;pend tho&s;e Hours they ware out in Plots &amp; Devices, in Com|munion with God, and leave all on him by ven|ture&s;ome believing; they would have more Peace and Comfort. I leave you with your GOD and mine. The LORD JESUS be with your Spirit. Pray for your <HI>own Soul,</HI> pray for <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>; and pray hard for your pour <HI>Brother.</HI></P>
