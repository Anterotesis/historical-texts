<HEAD>A mo&s;t <HI>UNACCOUNTABLE RELATION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THAT there are really Magicians, Conjurers and Witches, who have Commerce and Fa|miliarity with evil Spirits, is &s;o clear and plain, both from holy Scripture, Councils, Canons, and Civil Laws in all Nations, that none but tho&s;e Athie&s;ts, who would per&s;uade them&s;elves there are no Spi|rits, and con&s;equently no other Life after this, e|ver deny'd it; &s;ince the reality of this Conver&s;e with Spirits, their appearances and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions has been &s;o clearly demon&s;trated, not only in former Ages, but al&s;o in this, by Per&s;ons of mo&s;t acute Judgment and Learning, wherein they have fully an&s;wer'd all Objections to the contrary, &s;o that I need not enter any further into Controver&s;y, but &s;hall only give you an Account of one Mrs. <HI>Sarah Green,</HI> living at <HI>Bee&s;ley,</HI> in the County of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> who was a Per&s;on very well brought up, and de|&s;cended out of a good Family: At twenty Years of age &s;he was married to Mr. <HI>Thomas Green,</HI> a Farmer of a good E&s;tate, who had by her two Children, a Son and a Daughter, his Son being brought up a Clergyman. After they had been married near &s;ixteen Years, Mr. <HI>Thomas Green</HI> died, having &s;ettled his E&s;tate upon his two Children, and left a Competency &s;ufficient for the Mainte|nance of his Wife, but &s;he being a very proud wo|man, thought the Sub&s;tance left for her Support
<PB N="3" REF="041287_0003_101A6B50CEED4618">
not &s;ufficient to maintain her Pride and Greatne&s;s; in a little Time after &s;he fell into great Di&s;content, retiring her&s;elf from all Company, and by the &s;trong Temptations of the Devil, &s;he was drawn into the wicked Practice of Witchcraft, and in a &s;hort Time after, &s;old her&s;elf Soul and Body to the Devil, for fourteen Years, for the Enjoyment of worldly Plea&s;ures, and to have her De&s;ires &s;atis|fy'd: She was often &s;u&s;pected by &s;everal Per&s;ons to follow the wicked Practice of Witchcraft, be|cau&s;e if they happen'd to have any Difference with her, they commonly receiv'd Damage, either by Hurt to their Cattle or other Things; but in re|gard no certain Proof could be made, People dur&s;t not &s;peak their Opinion openly, but near the End of this fourteen Years &s;he grew very &s;ad and heavy, and &s;ending for her two Children, and three able Mini&s;ters, &s;he with abundance of Tears &s;poke thus to them: <HI>I have by my wretched Fate, followed Witchcraft &s;everal Years, and have &s;old my&s;elf both Soul and Body to the Devil for fourteen Years, only for the Plea&s;ures of this World, and to have my De|&s;ires &s;atisfied during that Time; but now all my Plea&s;ures and Delights are come to their la&s;t Period; for there remains only three Days of that Time; and then I &s;hall be carried away by infernal Spirits, in|to tho&s;e everla&s;ting Flames that will never have an End. And as the Devil was the Author of this my Wickedne&s;s, by per&s;wading me to it, &s;o he will like|wi&s;e be the Puni&s;her thereof. I de&s;ire you therefore that you would not cea&s;e to pray for me, but take me into the Church, and let there be u&s;ed P&s;alms

<HEAD>The Heads of the SERMON on this OCCASION.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>xvi. Chapter of</HI> Matthew, <HI>and 26 Ver&s;e,</HI></BIBL>
<P>For what is a Man profited if he &s;hall gain the whole World and lo&s;e his own Soul? Or what will a Man give in exchange for his Soul?</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AMong&s;t the many good Sermons that have been preached or publi&s;hed for the Salvati|on of Men's Souls, &s;urely no Subject can be more proper than that which teaches us to con&s;ider our latter End, by amending our Lives, and living Soberly, Righteou&s;ly, and Goldly in this pre&s;ent Life, that we may be partakers of Eternal Hap|pine&s;s in the Life to come. And indeed if Men were &s;o wi&s;e as to con&s;ider their latter End, it would be their chief Motive to them to leave their Sins and Wickedne&s;s, con&s;idering that the Soul ne|ver dies, but mu&s;t have a Being to all Eternity, and that there are but two Places for it to go to, either Heaven or Hell, for behold the Day com|eth that &s;hall burn as an Oven, and all the Proud yea, and all that do wickedly &s;hall be Stuble, and the Day cometh that &s;hall burn them up, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts, and &s;hall neither leave them Root nor Branch, <HI>Mat.</HI> iv. 10. While a Man

lives in Wickedne&s;s and Impiety, he hath not &s;o much as the hopes or a&s;&s;urance of eternal Salvati|on; and as touching this unhappy Woman, if &s;he had lived a more &s;ober and godly Life, and in&s;tead of &s;pending her precious Time in Pride and other ungodly Cour&s;es, had &s;pent it in read|ing the Scriptures, in Prayers, and hearing of Ser|mons, then &s;he would have been able to overcome and with&s;tand the Temptation and Delu&s;ions of the Devil, by which Means &s;he had never come to &s;uch a dreadful End; and we hope this terrible Example will be &s;ufficient Warning to all wicked profane Per&s;ons, how they dare to provoke God in &s;uch a dreadful Manner; and will be a Means to move all wicked Per&s;ons every where to amend their Lives. Many &s;trange Judgments and Warn|ings have happened in this Age. All which be|ing rightly con&s;idered, ought to put us in mind of Amendment of Life, and that our Tho'ts ought always to be on our latter End, and that there is a great Nece&s;&s;ity for us to turn from our Sins and Wickedne&s;s, or el&s;e our Ca&s;e hereafter will be dangerous, as more plainly appears, <HI>Luke</HI> xiii. 3, 5. <HI>Except ye repent ye &s;hall all likewi&s;e peri&s;h.</HI> So that if we continue in our Sins without Repen|tance, our Saviour expre&s;ly tells us what will be the Con&s;equence thereof, Let us therefore re&s;olve to turn from our evil Ways, while the Door of Mercy is open, that &s;o we may e&s;cape the Wrath to come. God might have cut us off before the&s;e awakening Judgments came, by which the Lord calls to the Inhabitants of the Earth to learn Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s,
<PB N="7" REF="041287_0007_101A6B53E9AD7AB8">
&s;o that thereby all wicked Per&s;ons might be awakened, and come out of that gro&s;s Dark|ne&s;s, and al&s;o all of us from a vain wicked and loo&s;e Conver&s;ation. Now as other Nations have had proofs of God's di&s;plea&s;ure, by the Plague that hath broke out among&s;t them, &s;o God in a wonderful Manner, has not only given us warning, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">t al&s;o time and &s;pace of Repentance; therefore let us &s;eek the Lord while he is to be found, that we may be ready prepared for his coming, le&s;t that Day &s;hould come upon us unawares. <HI>Watch therefore for ye know not what Hour your Lord doth come,</HI> Matt. xxiv. 42. We had need always to watch over our&s;elves, and be con&s;tantly upon our Guard, that there we may be able to overcome the Temp|tations of our Gho&s;tly Enemy, who goes about like a roaring Lion, &s;eeking who he may devour.</P>
<P>Certain it is, that it is appointed for all Men once to die and after that come to Judgment. Then how happy will it be for them that die well, watch therefore over your&s;elves that you may a|void Sin, which is the Wages not only of Tem|poral but of Eternal Death. No one is &s;ure how long he hath to live, therefore to live well is the greate&s;t Happine&s;s, that when the Lord cometh we may be found ready to meet him, and go with him into everla&s;ting Re&s;t. Then the Terrors of Death &s;hall not lay hold of you, nor the Flames of Hell affright you, though Heaven and Earth pa&s;s away with great Noi&s;e and fervent Heat, the Skies all flaming, and the World con&s;umed with Fire, no Evil &s;hall come nigh you; the Lord &s;hall come
<PB N="8" REF="041287_0008_101A6B56A5BA0CF0">
with thou&s;and of Angels and Saints to judge the Earth, whil&s;t the wicked ones &s;hall call for Rocks and Mountains to hide them from his Face; but &s;hall be to you a refre&s;hing Water in a thir&s;ty Land when you hear him &s;ay well done thou good and faithful Servant, enter thou into thy Ma&s;ter's Joy; you &s;hall be placed with the Sheep on the right Hand, and when the Wicked &s;hall go into ever|la&s;ting Fire prepared for the DEVIL and his Angels, you that have watched the Hour of his coming, and prepared your&s;elves to receive him, &s;hall a&s;|cend triumphantly with him, to &s;it down at his right Hand in Glory. Tho' the Sun be darkned and the Moon turned into Blood, and the Stars fall from Heaven in that great and eternal day of the Lord, your Bodies &s;hall rai&s;e gloriou&s;ly from the du&s;t to be united to the Soul, and not a Hair of your Head &s;hall be dimini&s;hed: you &s;hall receive the Reward of your Labour. For Eye hath not &s;een, nor Ear heard, nor hath it entered the Heart of Man to conceive tho&s;e Things that are laid up for the Righteous, nor the Torments tho&s;e feel that by wilful &s;inning &s;hall fail of that Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The Judgments and Exhortations mentioned, ought to make a deep Impre&s;&s;ion on our Minds, and give us &s;ober Thoughts: The which, God of his infinite Mercy give us that we may be always prepared for our latter End. <HI>The Grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the Love of God, be with you all evermore,</HI> AMEN.</P>
