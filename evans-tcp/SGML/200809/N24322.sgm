<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN it plea&s;ed God to manife&s;t the glorious Di&s;pen&s;ation of his ble&s;&s;ed Son, our Lord and Saviour, in the Fle&s;h, Apo&s;tles were called and &s;ent forth in his &s;ervice, and numbers believed in his name. The&s;e were to receive Power from on high after that the Holy Gho&s;t had come upon them, for which they were commaded to wait, and accordingly they were endued with the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>In the early times of Chri&s;tianity it was found nece&s;&s;ary for the Apo&s;tles, Di&s;ciples, and Believers, to meet often together for the con&s;olation and &s;trengthening one of another, when pur&s;uant to the very nature and de&s;ign of the Go&s;pel, which brought Peace on Earth, and good will to Men, a Care aro&s;e for the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment and edification of the Church, and their labour was, that all &s;hould be of one mind and become as one Family.</P>
<P>But in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of time the &s;implicity and good purpo&s;e of &s;uch Meetings declined, and a particular &s;et of Men, for worldly and carnal ends, a&s;&s;umed an authority, exerci&s;ing Lord&s;hip over the Flock (ob&s;erving the command of our Lord &s;o far only as to retain the name of Servants, when nothing was le&s;s in their view) pomp and power were a&s;&s;umed, and they made a di&s;tinction of them&s;elves by the aggrandizing name of the Peculiar Heritage of God, and then &s;ocial Good, and Charity in Mind and Practice was very much lo&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="032162_0007_0FF165C0EAF4B058">And as it hath plea&s;ed the Lord in the&s;e latter days, to call a People to freedom, and from under that unwarrantable Yoke of Bondage, &s;o he hath been plea&s;ed to rai&s;e in the Hearts of his Servants that primitive Love and Good will which eminently di&s;|tingui&s;hed his Di&s;ciples; wherein they have been per&s;uaded and directed, by his wi&s;dom and power, to have Meetings e&s;tabli&s;hed for like good purpo&s;es as in the primitive times, therein to wor|&s;hip him, and have over&s;ight, care, and compa&s;&s;ion one over ano|ther, and to endeavour that all may walk humbly, decently and hone&s;tly, and be of one mind, as becomes the Servants and Fol|lowers of our holy Lord.</P>
<P>This is called our Di&s;cipline, in the exerci&s;e whereof Per&s;ua&s;ion and gentle Dealing is and ought to be our practice; and when any, after all our Chri&s;tian endeavours cannot be reclaimed, the extent of our judgment is Cen&s;ure, or di&s;owning &s;uch to be of our religious Communion. And as this authority and Practice is Chri&s;tian, &s;o it is laudable and rea&s;onable in Society; for the good and reputation of the whole Body ought to claim our greate&s;t re|gard, &s;ubordinately including that of every Member. Hence ari&s;es a care and concern for Decency and comely order in all our Meet|ings for Wor&s;hip and Di&s;cipline, as well as hone&s;ty, plainne&s;s and orderly walking in all the Members of our religious Society, that others &s;eeing our good works may be induced to glorify our Fa|ther who is the Author of them, and thereby be brought into that Faith which works by Love to the purifying of the Heart.</P>
<P>And for the wor&s;hip of God, and the more regular and ea&s;y proceeding in the &s;ervice and di&s;cipline of the Church, Meetings have been by Divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as above hinted, &s;et up and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, &s;erviceable and &s;ubordinate to each other, as particular
<PB N="vii" REF="032162_0008_0FF165C2CA312568">
Meetings for wor&s;hip, one or more of which con&s;titute a Prepara|tive Meeting. Monthly, which mo&s;tly take in &s;everal particular or Preparative Meetings, who are to meet together once a month. Quarterly, including &s;o many monthly Meetings as may under right direction mo&s;t u&s;efully meet together once every three months. And Yearly, which is compo&s;ed of &s;o many Quarterly Meetings as may mo&s;t conveniently attend the &s;ame; each of which have their re&s;pective Powers and Service for the well ordering of Society, and advancement of Truth and Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>And whereas it hath been experienced, that in the&s;e Meetings great comfort, &s;upport, and &s;atisfaction have been received and enjoyed, when the members have attended them in awe, humility, and love, with no other views but the &s;ervice of God, and the help and a&s;&s;i&s;tance one of another, all friends who are, or would be, accounted members of tho&s;e Meetings, are, in brotherly love exhorted, that they come together in uprightne&s;s and &s;inglene&s;s of heart, &s;uitable to our calling, and the dignity of that power, which, as we rightly and meekly &s;o demean our&s;elves, will pre&s;ide and govern in all our Meetings; and there we ought to wait for the &s;pirit of Meekne&s;s and Charity, which is the e&s;&s;ential adorning which God will beautify and cloath his true Church with, with|out which none can be truly Members thereof, nor really &s;ervice|able therein. This will dive&s;t of Partiality, &s;tiffne&s;s in opinion, and high thoughts of our&s;elves, or of our own &s;trength and abili|ties, and rai&s;e in us Patience and conde&s;cen&s;ion, according to that excellent admonition of our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord, who knows the &s;ecrets of all Hearts, <Q>But he that is greate&s;t among you &s;hall be your Servant.</Q> Matt. XXIII. 11.22.26. 1719</P>

<P N="3">3rd. March was &s;o denominated from Mars, feigned to be the God of War, whom Romulus, Founder of the Roman Empire, pretended to be his Father.</P>
<P N="4">4th. April is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to derive its Name from the Greek appellation of Venus, an imaginary Godde&s;s, wor&s;hipped by the Romans.</P>
<P N="5">5th. May is &s;aid to have been &s;o called from Maia the Mother of Mercury, another of their pretended ethnic Deities, to whom in this Month they paid their Devotions.</P>

<P>The other Four Months, namely, September, October, No|vember, and December, &s;till retain their numerical Latin Names, which according to the late regulation of the Calender will for the future be improperly applied.

<P>As the Idolatrous Romans thus gave Names to &s;everal of the Months, in honour of their pretended Deities; &s;o the like Idolatry prevailing among our Saxon Ance&s;tors, induced them to call the Days of the Week by the Name of the Idol which on that Day they peculiarly wor&s;hiped&mdash;hence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Days.</NOTE>The Fir&s;t Day of the Week they called Sunday, from their ac|cu&s;tomary adoration of the Sun on that Day.</P>

<P>The Third Day of the Week they named Tue&s;day, in honour of one of their Idols called Tui&s;co.</P>
<P>The Fourth Day of the Week was called Wedne&s;day, from the Appellation of Woden, another of their Idols.</P>
<P>The Fifth Day of the Week was called Thur&s;day, from the Name of an Idol called Thor, to whom they paid their Devoti|ons on that Day.</P>

<HEAD>Some Ob&s;ervations relating to the E&s;tabli&s;hment of Schools.</HEAD>
<P>It is the opinion of the Committee, that Friends having united with others, in employing &s;uch Per&s;ons for Ma&s;ters, who have not &s;ubmitted to the operation of Truth, hath had a tendency to &s;trengthen a di&s;po&s;ition in our Youth to avoid the Cro&s;s, and unite with the &s;pirit of the World; whereby many hurtful and corrupt things have gained ground among&s;t us.</P>
<P>On reviewing the Minutes of the Yearly Meeting, we find, that at &s;everal Meetings, particularly at and &s;ince the Year 1750, the con&s;ideration of the importance of training up our Youth in u&s;eful Learning, under the tuition of religious, prudent Per&s;ons, &s;uitably qualified for that &s;ervice, came weightily before the Meeting; when it was recommended, that Friends &s;hould exert them&s;elves therein as fully as their circum&s;tances would permit; and that the likelie&s;t means to induce Per&s;ons properly qualified, to undertake the bu&s;ine&s;s would be, to have &s;ome certain income fixed, in con|&s;ideration of which the Ma&s;ter &s;hould be obliged to teach &s;o many Children, on behalf of each Monthly or Particular Meeting, as the &s;aid Meeting &s;hall judge adequate to the Salary; and that no Ma&s;ter &s;hould be employed, but with the approbation of a Com|mittee of the Monthly Meeting, appointed for that and other &s;er|vices, relating to &s;uch Schools: But we find that notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e pre&s;&s;ing recommendations, very little has been effectually done therein. We therefore think it nece&s;&s;ary that it be recom|mended to the Quarterly, and from thence to the Monthly and Preparative Meetings, that the former advice of collecting a Fund, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment and &s;upport of Schools, under the care of a &s;tanding Committee appointed by the &s;everal Monthly or Parti|cular Meetings, &s;hould generally take place, and that it be recom|mended by the Yearly Meeting, to Friends of each Quarter, to &s;end up the next Year an account of what they have done therein. And we al&s;o think it nece&s;&s;ary, that this weighty concern &s;hould in future become the continued care of the Yearly Meeting, by an Annual Query; that &s;o the matter may re&s;t on a &s;olid foundation, and every po&s;&s;ible encouragement and a&s;&s;i&s;tance may be afforded to
<PB N="116" REF="032162_0116_0FF166EFDBD70F58">
Friends, in the &s;ettlement of Schools, procuring Ma&s;ters &amp;c. &amp;c. through the whole extent of the Yearly Meeting. And, notwith|&s;tanding &s;ome difficulties may appear in the rai&s;ing a &s;ufficiency, fully to an&s;wer the end propo&s;ed, yet as improvements of this kind have often ari&s;en from &s;mall beginnings, it is de&s;ired, that Friends be not di&s;couraged, by their inability, but having faith in the divine ble&s;&s;ing, being conferred on their benevolent intentions, would begin, by making &s;ome provi&s;ion, agreeable to the circum|&s;tances of their re&s;pective Meetings. That within the compa&s;s of each Meeting, where the &s;ettlement of a &s;chool is nece&s;&s;ary, a lot of Ground be provided, &s;ufficient for a Garden, Orchard, Gra&s;s for a Cow, &amp;c. And that a &s;uitable Hou&s;e, Stable &amp;c. be erect|ed thereon. There are but few Meetings but which may, in la|bour, in materials or money, rai&s;e &s;o much as would an&s;wer this charge. Such a provi&s;ion would be an encouragement for a &s;taid Per&s;on with a family, who will be likely to remain a con&s;iderable time, perhaps, his whole life, in the &s;ervice, to engage therein. This will obviate the nece&s;&s;ity Friends often think them&s;elves under, of hiring no other but a &s;ingle per&s;on, for a Ma&s;ter, on account of boarding him, from one Hou&s;e to another, among&s;t them&s;elves; hence they are induced to bargain with tran&s;ient Per&s;ons, often of doubtful characters; &s;ome of whom have proved to be Men of corrupt minds; and even where their conduct is moral, yet they are &s;eldom likely to remain in the &s;ervice any longer than &s;ome employ more agreeable to &s;upport them&s;elves offers: Whereby the Teachers mi&s;s of opportunity of improvement, which nothing will give, equal to that experience gained by long practice, in the edu|cation or the Youth. A &s;ervice, which, however it may be &s;lighted by many, if duly performed, is as arduous to the Teacher, as it is of advantage to the Youth: And which if it was undertaken by pious minded Per&s;ons, more from an inclination of benefiting the Youth, than from a de&s;ire of gain, would afford a &s;atisfaction far exceeding that of &s;pending their time either in &s;upinene&s;s and ea&s;e, delighting them&s;elves in the enjoyment of their Wealth, or in the plea&s;ure of ama&s;&s;ing more. For indeed as the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves I. Cor. VI. 20. II. Cor. V. 15. <Q>Ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a price&mdash;that they which live &s;hould not henceforth live unto them&s;elves, but unto him which died for them.</Q> And here a &s;orrowful con&s;ideration occurs, which we
<PB N="117" REF="032162_0117_0FF166F2D4F08110">
de&s;ire to mention with caution and tenderne&s;s, that is the back|wardne&s;s &s;o apparent among&s;t us to contribute that part of our &s;ub|&s;tance, which the circum&s;tance of things and the nece&s;&s;ities of the People, have on different occa&s;ions made nece&s;&s;ary; if this had not been the ca&s;e, a matter of &s;o great importance as the virtuous edu|cation of our Youth, would not have lain neglected, for &s;o long a cour&s;e of Years; after &s;uch pre&s;&s;ing advices had been, &s;o expre&s;&s;ly, handed down from the Yearly Meeting: Hence ari&s;es a query, how far our neglect of applying to the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ervice of our fel|low-men, &s;uch part of the goods many have laid up in &s;tore, is one of the cau&s;es of the deep affliction which now &s;o feelingly at|tends, and how &s;mall a part of what has been forcibly taken from many, if it had been &s;ea&s;onably, and cheerfully contributed, would have an&s;wered the &s;everal good purpo&s;es, which have either been refu&s;ed, or neglected by us.</P>
<P>The giving proper encouragement to &s;uch Teachers as are capa|ble by example and precept, to promote the growth of piety and virtue; as well as due in&s;truction in our Youth, and are likely to continue in the &s;ervice, would be attended with further advanta|ges as well from the experience the Teachers would nece&s;&s;arily gain, as the opportunity they would have of training up lame Chil|dren, and &s;uch, who in other re&s;pects, may be incapable of &s;up|porting them&s;elves by labour, to be educated and qualified to &s;erve as School Ma&s;ters; a con&s;ideration well worthy our particular Care, as well from duty as intere&s;t. The benefit of the Youth, and the means of a comfortable living for the Ma&s;ter, may be in|crea&s;ed, by the conveniency which might be made, for boarding &s;ome children, under his care, who&s;e di&s;tant &s;ituation might other|wi&s;e impede their in&s;truction.</P>
<P>And if to what has been propo&s;ed, Friends were willing to add the promoting a &s;ub&s;cription, towards a Fund, the increa&s;e of which might be employed in paying the Ma&s;ter's Salary, if nece&s;&s;ary, and promoting the education of the poorer Friend's children; &s;uch a Fund though it might be but &s;mall in the beginning, being a fix|ed object, would draw the attention of Friends to contribute, whereas &s;o long as there is no beginning made, this weighty &s;er|vice is neglected, by many, who would be glad of giving encou|ragement to &s;o nece&s;&s;ary and good a work. And although many may not be able to give much, yet as they are willing to contri|bute,
<PB N="118" REF="032162_0118_0FF166F7ECCCB830">
in proportion to their abilities, it will, like the Widow's Mite, entitle them to the ble&s;&s;ing: People frequently appear to think it is at their option to do what they will with their &s;ub&s;tance which they call their own, to give or to withhold, at their plea|&s;ure, forgetting that they are but as Stewards, accountable to him who has entru&s;ted them: Others think they are ju&s;tifiable, though in the neglect of this plain Duty, in order to heap up the more Riches for their offspring, contrary to our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's expre&s;s Command, "Lay not up for your&s;elves trea&s;ures on the Earth," and notwith&s;tanding the multiplied experience, daily before our Eyes, that Riches, generally prove as Wings to rai&s;e their Children above Truth; or as thick Clay to bind them to the Earth; But neither of the&s;e conclu&s;ions will &s;tand the te&s;t of that Go&s;pel injunc|tion, "Thou &s;halt love thy Neighbour as thy&s;elf;" nor enable to give a &s;atisfactory account when that alarming proclamation will be made, <Q>Steward, give an account of thy Steward&s;hip, for thou maye&s;t be no longer Steward.</Q></P>
