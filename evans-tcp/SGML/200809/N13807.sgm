<Q><BIBL>ISAIAH <HI>viii. 20.</HI></BIBL>
<P>To the Law and to the Testimony: If they &s;peak not according to this Word, it is becau&s;e there is no Light in them.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HAPPY are the people who live where divine revelation &s;hines. This is not the portion of all the nations of the earth; <HI>I&s;rael</HI> of old was thus favoured. "GOD &s;hewed his word unto <HI>Jacob,</HI> his &s;tatutes and his judgments unto <HI>I&s;rael</HI>: He hath not dealt &s;o with any nations, and as for his judgments they have not known them(<HI>a</HI>)". Since the P&s;almi&s;t thus expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, GOD has been plea&s;ed to make a clearer and more explicit reve|lation or his will; contained in what is called the New Te&s;tament, this revelation <HI>we</HI> enjoy together with <HI>that</HI> which was anciently given to the <HI>Jews.</HI> But whil&s;t this is our happy &s;tate, a great part of the world &s;till lies in darkne&s;s, they have nothing but the light of nature to di|rect them, they "&s;et in the region and &s;hadow of death <HI>(b),"</HI> they grope in the dark, they "&s;eek the LORD, by the dim taper of rea&s;on, if haply they might feel after him and find him <HI>(c)".</HI> Whil&s;t this is the &s;ad condition of many of the nations around us, we have the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of "the people that know the joyful &s;ound <HI>(d)".</HI> The &s;overeignty of GOD is to be adored in the di&s;crimination that he has made among the nations of the earth; and greatly is he to be prai&s;ed that he has &s;o highly favoured us above many people, who by nature were equal, and perhaps on other accounts &s;uperior to our&s;elves. Well may we adopt the words of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour and &s;ay, "we thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, becau&s;e thou
<PB N="6" REF="017449_0004_0FA11DD332C8DAC0">
ha&s;t hid the&s;e things from the wi&s;e and prudent, and ha&s;t revealed them to us babes. Even &s;o Father, for &s;o it hath &s;eemed good in thy &s;ight<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> xi. 25.</NOTE>." This revelation thus grant|ed to us, is tran&s;mitted down in writing. Now all writ|ing is in a greater or le&s;s degree uncertain. This is e&s;|pecially true of all ancient compo&s;itions. Ob&s;curity is produced by length of time. An additional happine&s;s, therefore, do we enjoy in having an order of men, divine|ly appointed, to explain, as well as to inculcate and en|force, this <HI>word</HI> and <HI>will</HI> of GOD. The ignorance of a very con&s;iderable part of mankind, and the ambiguity of all kinds of writing being properly con&s;idered, it mu&s;t appear a mighty privilege to have a &s;et of men, who&s;e <HI>lei&s;ure</HI> and <HI>education</HI> &s;hall enable them, in &s;ome degree, to unfold the doctrinal truths of this writen revelation. Were multitudes upon reading the <HI>&s;criptures,</HI> to be a&s;ked, as Phillip of old a&s;ked the Eunuch, "under&s;tande&s;t thou what thou reade&s;t?" they like him mu&s;t an&s;wer, "how can I except &s;ome man guide me<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Acts</HI> viii. 30.</NOTE>!" Though the Old and New Te&s;tament be, in the mo&s;t important parts thereof, &s;ufficiently intelligible, yet there are not only in St. Paul's epi&s;tles, but in other books of &s;cripture, "&s;ome things hard to be under&s;tood, which the ignorant and un&s;table are liable to wre&s;t to their own de&s;truction<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">2. <HI>Pet.</HI> iii. 16.</NOTE>." The wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of GOD, therefore, are mo&s;t devoutly to be acknowledged in the in&s;titution of the go&s;pel mini&s;try. But alas! the be&s;t appointments are liable to be corrupt|ed. Mini&s;ters, who&s;e &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s it is to explain and en|force the doctrines of &s;cripture, &s;ometimes gro&s;sly mi&s;|repre&s;ent them. When this is the ca&s;e, lamentable is the condition of tho&s;e people who &s;et under them. If the "leaders of the people cau&s;e them to err, tho&s;e that are led of them will be de&s;troyed<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah <HI>ix. 16.</HI></NOTE>." If "they who&s;e lips &s;hould pre&s;erve knowledge, and at who&s;e mouths the people &s;hould &s;eek the law, are ignorant or erronious," then the "blind lead the blind and both will fall into the ditch." The light &s;hould be in the head, "but if the light that is therein be darkne&s;s, how great is that dark|ne&s;s<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Math.</HI> vi. 23.</NOTE>?" The prophet I&s;aiah, con&s;cious of the&s;e things,
<PB N="7" REF="017449_0005_0FA11DD3F176E720">
calls upon all that pretended to &s;peak in the name of the LORD to have recour&s;e not to <HI>familiar &s;pirits and wizards that peep and mutter, but to the law and the te&s;timony, and declared that if they &s;peak not according to that word, it was becau&s;e there was no light in them.</HI> From the words thus introduced I &s;hall attempt the following things.</P>
<P N="1">I. That it is the duty of the mini&s;ters of religion to preach and &s;peak both <HI>publickly</HI> and <HI>privately</HI> agreeably to the &s;criptures of truth.</P>
<P N="2">II. Shew that &s;ometimes they depart therefrom, and particularly point out when they may be &s;aid to do &s;o.</P>
<P N="3">III. Mention &s;ome of the rea&s;ons why mini&s;ters do not always &s;peak agreeably to the divine law and te&s;timony. And then conclude with a &s;uitable application.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e particulars, a few words will &s;uf|fice. We all agree that "mini&s;ters are in &s;ome peculiar <HI>&s;en&s;e put in trust with the people, and are &s;tewards of the my&s;teries of GOD."</HI> It is acknowledged very generally, that as the canon of &s;cripture is completed; &s;o vi&s;ions, in&s;pirations, prophecies and miracles have cea&s;ed. Mini&s;|ters have at this day no &s;uch extraordinary powers as they were ve&s;ted with, in the days of the Apo&s;tles; &s;o that if there were need of a new revelation, or an addition to the old one, there are no per&s;ons capacitated to undertake the mighty ta&s;k. But there is no &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity. The &s;cripture is full and complete. When the revelation of <HI>John</HI> the divine on the i&s;land of PATMOS ended, the canon of &s;cripture was clo&s;ed, and a cur&s;e denounced a|gain&s;t the pre&s;umptuous wretch "that &s;hould dare to add <HI>to</HI> or dimini&s;h therefrom; his part &s;hould be taken away from the book of life." Since therefore no addition is to be made to divine revelation, the <HI>&s;tewards of the my&s;teries of GOD</HI> have nothing el&s;e to do, than explain and incul|cate <HI>that</HI> which we now enjoy. They are not to make a new, but rationally to interpret the bible we at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;s. They are to come to their people, with a "thus &s;aith the LORD;" and no further are they to be re|garded, then as they &s;peak according to the <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Te&s;timony. The&s;e</HI> &s;hould not only be the foundation of their preaching, but frequent recurrence &s;hould be made thereto; and all their di&s;cour&s;es, on topicks dubious and
<PB N="8" REF="017449_0006_0FA11DD4B23AFE58">
di&s;putable &s;hould ever be vindicated and &s;upported by pa&s;&s;ages of revelation, con&s;i&s;tently interpreted. As the &s;criptures are a complete rule of faith and practice, &s;o no knowledge more than what is contained in them, is nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;alvation. Other knowledge indeed is convenient and ornamental, and &s;tudiou&s;ly to be &s;ought after; but it is no further u&s;eful to the go&s;pel mini&s;ters than as it is a <HI>hand-maid</HI> to divinity, and &s;erves to illucidate the dark and intricate parts of revelation. It is highly nece&s;&s;ary for this purpo&s;e; and the mo&s;t learned divine is qualified, and (other things being equal) will be, the be&s;t mini&s;ter. But if his exten&s;ive knowledge leads him a&s;tray (as it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed it &s;ometimes does) by indulging to &s;pe|culations of his own, and hearkening to the vagaries of a conceited mind, then in all important points, it may be &s;aid that there is no light in him; none that conduces to the &s;alvation of his hearers, none that will be profitable to him&s;elf, in <HI>the great day of the LORD.</HI> The&s;e ob&s;er|vations, &s;howing it to be the duty of public teachers, to make the &s;criptures the rule and mea&s;ure of their preach|ing, we find confirmed not only by my text, but al&s;o by the <HI>expre&s;s</HI> and <HI>direct a&s;&s;ertion</HI> of St. Peter, who &s;ays, "If any man &s;peak, let him &s;peak as the oracles of GOD<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">1. <HI>Pet.</HI> iv. 11.</NOTE>", &s;ince in the &s;acred &s;criptures we have "a &s;ure word of pro|phecy, and are per&s;uaded that we have not followed cun|ningly devi&s;ed fables, certainly we &s;hould do well to take heed thereunto," not only make them the men of our coun|&s;el, but the rule of our preaching. But though from &s;cripture, and the rea&s;on of the thing, it is &s;ufficiently evi|dent that mini&s;ters are obligated to repre&s;ent to their hearers only the truths and doctrines of divine revelation; yet &s;ome per&s;ons fail of this de&s;ign, and that in &s;o great a degree as to render them un&s;afe and dangerous to be be|lieved or followed. Of this I propo&s;ed to &s;peak in the &s;econd head of my di&s;cour&s;e. And here to prevent mi&s;|takes, let it be ob&s;erved, that among all the teachers of religion, none are to be found, who without error or mi&s;|take, are capable perfectly to expound the law and will of GOD; neither are <HI>any two</HI> ever to be met with, who al|ways,
<PB N="9" REF="017449_0007_0FA11DD57231F1F0">
in all points agree in the explanation of it. This is not to be expected. The lot of humanity will not per|mit it: There are &s;ome things, even in &s;cripture, of which we mu&s;t be contentedly ignorant, till we drop this mortal fle&s;h, and arrive at the world of perfect vi&s;ion. This igno|rance and imperfection of mini&s;ters does not de&s;troy the utility of their office. Neither are we to throw away any man, who as a public teacher, does not explain and inter|pret every pa&s;&s;age or doctrine of &s;cripture, according to our own &s;entiments. A man is not to be <HI>made an offender for a word.</HI> Allowances are to be made for the frailties of human nature. Freedom of enquiry is to be indulged; and great candour is to be exerci&s;ed, by the people, to|wards their mini&s;ters. We are not ha&s;tily to conclude, that a preacher is dangerou&s;ly erronious, becau&s;e all his &s;entiments do not co-incide with our pre-conceived opi|nion.</P>
<P>Though the exact knowledge of all parts of &s;cripture would be highly plea&s;ing to the inqui&s;itive mind; yet mi&s;takes in many parts thereof, are con&s;i&s;tent with a &s;tate of &s;alvation. The future happine&s;s of our &s;ouls will not be prevented thereby. If an exact knowledge of divine revelation, in all its parts, were nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, who then could be &s;aved? All the important doctrines of &s;crip|ture are &s;o plainly revealed, that good men are generally agreed in them. Differences among mini&s;ters are often|times merely verbal; and (if they are otherwi&s;e) their dif|ference is <HI>mo&s;tly</HI> about the more intricate and le&s;s impor|tant matters of revelation. But then, &s;ometimes it &s;o happens that they widely and e&s;&s;entially differ; differ in matters highly important, by which the &s;alvation of their own, and their hearers &s;ouls may be greatly endangered; if not finally lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Few mini&s;ters are ever to be found, &s;o corrupt and erro|nious, but will &s;ometimes entertain their hearers, with the true and genuine doctrines of the go&s;pel. The difficulty and the danger with un&s;ound teachers is, that they inter|mix fal&s;hood with truth; and too much neglect plain, &s;criptural doctrines, for the &s;ake of preaching up the fan|cies and figments of their own di&s;tempered brains. The <HI>church</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> is doubtle&s;s the mo&s;t corrupt chri&s;tian
<PB N="10" REF="017449_0008_0FA11DD633E06540">
church now in the world; yet it is well known that a part of their creed is agreeable to the belief of &s;ound pro|te&s;tants, and to the &s;tandard of &s;cripture. Their error and danger lie principally in the human mixtures they have introduced, and the corrupt additions they have made, to the &s;acred doctrines; as appears particularly from <HI>Pope Pius</HI>'s creed. That church holds to Chri&s;t as the head; they lay him in the foundation; but they have built on this foundation a mo&s;t erronious &s;tructure of error and fol|ly. On this foundation, they have built not only what the apo&s;tle calls <HI>"gold, &s;ilver, precious &s;tones,</HI> but <HI>wood, hay, and &s;tubble</HI><NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> iii. 12, 13.</NOTE>. Their doctrines of <HI>tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, invocation</HI> of &s;aints, prayers to the <HI>virgin Mary; indulgences,</HI> prayers for the dead, <HI>penance, pilgrimages, auricular confe&s;&s;ion,</HI> and a hundred other ab&s;urdities, have &s;o eaten out the vitals of chri&s;tianity, or at lea&s;t, have &s;o corrupted the &s;implici|ty, ob&s;cured the glory, and vailed the beauty of the go&s;|pel, as to make that communion an extremely danger|ous <HI>one</HI>; and &s;uch as we ought never to enter, even though we have no right to &s;ay that &s;alvation cannot be had therein. This la&s;t &s;uper&s;tructure, being compo&s;ed of combu&s;tible materials, as <HI>wood, hay, &s;tubble,</HI> will be burnt up; and the builders will &s;uffer lo&s;s, but them&s;elves may be &s;aved; yet &s;o, as by fire, that is with difficulty and narrowly, as goods are &s;aved out of an hou&s;e all in flames over our heads. The church of the Jews in the days of our Saviour, acted much the &s;ame part: They departed from the <HI>law</HI> and <HI>testimony.</HI> They <HI>tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the com|mandments of GOD,</HI> and in many in&s;tances made them of no effect <HI>by their traditions,</HI> as our ble&s;&s;ed LORD &s;aid, and made evident. Their partial repre&s;entations, corrupt comments and glo&s;&s;es, enervated the &s;criptures, and tend|ed to mi&s;lead their hearers, and cau&s;e them to expect &s;al|vation in a way in which it was not to be found. Leav|ing the &s;implicity of the law, "they taught for doctrines the commandments of men<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> xv. 9.</NOTE>". And as "the leaders of GOD's people anciently cau&s;ed them to err," &s;o it is no breach of charity to a&s;&s;ert that this is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e at
<PB N="11" REF="017449_0009_0FA11DD731B4D698">
the pre&s;ent day. There are tho&s;e among us who pervert the go&s;pel of CHRIST, who corrupt the word of GOD, and, even, in &s;ome in&s;tances, repre&s;ent things &s;o differently from the truth as it is in JESUS, that they may be &s;aid to preach another go&s;pel." If &s;ometimes they entertain their hearers with the <HI>doctrines</HI> of <HI>grace clearly,</HI> and <HI>&s;trickingly</HI> repre&s;ented, it nobly prepares their minds for the reception of their poi&s;onous errors, and greatly facili|tates the entrance of pernicious fal&s;hoods into them. In &s;uch a ca&s;e as this, the preacher, (if allowed to be erroni|ous at all) is &s;uppo&s;ed by many to err on the right &s;ide; that it is only an exce&s;s of orthodoxy, that he has a good de&s;ign, means to exalt the divine &s;overeignty; and if he &s;peaks wickedly, does it for GOD." But however the errors of &s;uch kind of teachers may be palliated and excu&s;ed by a particular kind of hearers, yet it is much to be doubted whether they will be excu&s;ed &s;o ea&s;ily at the bar of GOD. It is the duty of teachers to preach the truth, and nothing but the truth; to deliver the whole coun&s;el of of GOD and keep back nothing that is profita|ble." What then &s;hall we think of the man who oc|ca&s;ionally only preaches the genuine doctrines of the go&s;|pel, whil&s;t the mo&s;t of his time and zeal are expended in bringing into view a &s;ort of theology produced by the con|junctions of pride and metaphi&s;ic; as, one expre&s;&s;es it, a kind of Divinity "&s;pun, as the &s;pider does his web, out of his own bowels." The&s;e things being ob&s;erved in gene|ral, I would now particularly &s;ay, that a teacher of re|ligion goes counter to the directions of my text, when he preaches things concerning which the bible is totally &s;ilent. This at once will exclude from the pulpit all di&s;cour&s;es of <HI>phylo&s;ophy,</HI> a&s;tronomy, metaphi&s;ics, &amp;c. For the &s;criptures were never de&s;igned to teach us any of the above &s;ciences.</P>
<P>Again, the text is contradicted when a mini&s;ter con|fines his time in the pulpit in endeavors to explain matters that are too wonderful for him; my&s;teries that are high and &s;ublime; to which he cannot attain; and on which it is impo&s;&s;ible for him to throw any degree of light. The introducing the <HI>fine &s;pun distinctions</HI> and <HI>curious explications</HI> of the <HI>&s;chools</HI> into di&s;cour&s;es of divinity, has darkned rather then illu&s;trated the doctrines of &s;crip|ture. Revelation has been adultrated, and it's benevo|lent
<PB N="12" REF="017449_0010_0FA11DD8F1DE1D00">
purpo&s;e in &s;ome degree, ob&s;tructed by this method of procedure. How vain are all attempts to explain the manner of CHRIST's conception in the womb of the Virgin Mary, by the over&s;hadowing of the Holy Gho&s;t. How idle and futile are all pretended explana|tions concerning the modes of the union between the two natures of Chri&s;t, commonly called the hypo&s;tatic union? Who is able to declare CHRIST's eternal genera|tion; who can clearly and intelligibly &s;hew how he was the Son of GOD, and how the &s;on of man? how the &s;pirit operates upon the hearts of men, and how he origi|nally proceeded from the Father and the Son? and what is the unity of the divine per&s;ons, and what their differ|ence? Tho&s;e doctrines cannot be enlightened by any di&s;qui&s;itions of human rea&s;on. We believe them upon the authority of divine revelation and know no more about them, then that reveals. Nay, if the &s;pirit of GOD had de&s;cended to a particular explanation of the&s;e my&s;teri|ous matters, we could not have comprehended his meaning, or gained any light, unle&s;s our minds had been enlarged. But this we know, that it was not the manner of our Saviour and his apo&s;tles to enter into any explanation of the&s;e in|comprehen&s;ible things, the &s;cripture pa&s;&s;es them over in profound &s;ilence; and &s;o ought they who undertake to be the public di&s;pen&s;ers of it. That this is extending our enquir|ies to a latitude beyond what the bible will ju&s;tify, might be illu&s;trated by a multitude of in&s;tances; but to prevent being tedious, I &s;hall &s;elect only a few. And to go on; what avail all the di&s;tinctions <HI>divines</HI> have &s;ometimes made concerning the nature of <HI>grace,</HI> whether it differs in kind or degree, be <HI>&s;pecial</HI> or <HI>common,</HI> influence the mind in one way or another? So long as we know that GOD will a&s;&s;i&s;t us, if we endeavour to &s;erve him; and never wants means to effect his de&s;igns? Of what advantage are heated controver&s;ies concerning the abilities of unre|generate men? &s;o long as we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that they are commanded to love and obey GOD, and that GOD does not command impo&s;ibilities, but his com|mand makes it our duty to do what we can, and his grace will be perfect in our weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>That GOD is omni&s;cient, all agree; that all future events, even &s;uch as are called contingent&punc; are known by
<PB N="13" REF="017449_0011_0FA11DD932E5BD48">
him, long before they take place, is not di&s;puted. The preacher, who, not content with a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters">ming that this per|fection belongs to GOD, undertakes to explain how the pre&s;cience of the Deity does, or does not con&s;i&s;t with the liberty of man is wi&s;e above what is written, and oftentimes <HI>"darkens coun&s;el by words without knowledge."</HI> And if the re&s;ult of his &s;peculations on this head, &s;hould be, that man is not a free agent in the common acceptation of the words, that his will is fa&s;t bound in fate; that he has not a principle of efficiency, by which to determine his own volitions and actions, but like a machine is operated upon; that all his liberty con&s;i&s;ts meerly in voluntarine&s;s and is by no means to be oppo&s;ed to nece&s;&s;ity, I &s;ay if the re&s;ult of his rea&s;onings on the divine omni&s;cience, &s;hould be &s;uch as is repre&s;ented above (nearly as has been in fact the ca&s;e) then he departs from the <HI>law</HI> and <HI>te&s;timony</HI> in a &s;till higher and more important &s;en&s;e. In this ca&s;e he not only &s;peaks where the &s;cripture is &s;ilent; but really contradicts it in a point that is highly e&s;&s;ential.

For though &s;everal people, and &s;ome very wicked ones too, have taught the doctrine of fate and nece&s;&s;ity; and &s;ome of them evi|dently with a de&s;ign to &s;ubvert all religion, and even the being of GOD; yet nothing can be plainer than that the reverlation of GOD to man, uniformly con&s;iders him as <HI>free,</HI> and addre&s;&s;es him from the beginning of <HI>Ge|ne&s;is</HI> to the end of the <HI>Apocalyp&s;e,</HI> accordingly<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">Though it is &s;omewhat contrary to my pre&s;ent de&s;ign to enter into any rea&s;oning on this point, yet as it is a matter that has employed the thoughts and pens of many writers, I will beg leave ju&s;t to give the &s;enti|ments of the great and learned Dr. SAMUEL CLARKE, on it, &s;peaking of God's knowledge extending to the mo&s;t contingent futurities, even the actions of free agents, he &s;ays, "There is in this matter one difficulty which has in all ages employed the &s;peculations of con&s;idering men; namely, how foreknowledge in God, can be con&s;i&s;tent with liberty of ac|tion in men." In an&s;wer to which, he &s;ays, "1&s;t. That our finite under|&s;tanding may rea&s;onably be allowed, not to be able to comprehend all the ways of infinite knowledge; Job xi. 7. "Can'&s;t thou by &s;carching find out God? Can&s;t thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? &amp;c. This ac|knowledgement of the incomprehen&s;iblene&s;s of the ways of God mu&s;t al|ways be under&s;tood with relation to &s;uch things only as do not imply any expre&s;s contradiction.&mdash;Al&s;o, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that this acknow|ledgement ought to be under&s;tood <HI>only</HI> of things, expre&s;sly revealed, not of any human doctrines. 2dly, It is furher nece&s;&s;ary to promi&s;e that in the matter before us, the que&s;tion is not, whether men's actions be free; but whether or no, and how, that freedom of action which makes men to be men, can be con&s;i&s;tent with the foreknowledge of &s;uch actions: for if the&s;e two things were really incon&s;i&s;tent, and could by no means be re|conciled; it would follow, not that men's actions were not free; (for that would de&s;troy all religion, and take away all the moral attributes of God at once;) but on the other &s;ide, it would follow, that &s;uch free actions as men's are, and without which rational creatures could not be rational creatures, were not the objects of the divine foreknowledge. And in &s;uch ca&s;e, it would be no more a dimunition of God's omni&s;cience, not to know things impo&s;&s;ible and contradictory to be known; than it is a dimunition of his omnipotence, not to be able to do things impo&s;&s;ible and contradictory to be done: But this is not the ca&s;e: For the&s;e two things being premi&s;ed we may now an&s;wer directly to the difficulty it&s;elf, namely, how foreknow|ledge in God can be con&s;i&s;tent with liberty of action in men; and they are therefore con&s;i&s;tent, becau&s;e foreknowledge has no influence at-all upon the things foreknown; and it has therefore no influence upon them, be|cau&s;e things would be ju&s;t as they are, and not otherwi&s;e, if there was no foreknowledge. Foreknowledge does not cau&s;e things to be; but things that are to be hereafter, whether nece&s;&s;arily or freely, are the cau&s;e of it's being foreknown that they &s;hould &s;o be, whether nece&s;&s;arily or freely. The futurity of free actions is exactly the &s;ame, and in the nature of things them&s;elves, as the like certainty in event, whether they <HI>can</HI> or <HI>could not</HI> be foreknown. As our knowing a thing to be, when we &s;ee it is, does not hinder an action from being free, notwith&s;tanding it is then certain, and cannot but be, when it is: So God's foreknowing that any action will free|ly be done, does not at all hinder its being free, though he knows it cer|tainly; becau&s;e his fore&s;eeing things to come, does no more influence, or alter the nature of things, than our &s;eeing them when they are.&mdash;The manner of God's knowing future free actions, mu&s;t not indeed be, like his foreknowledge of things nece&s;&s;ary. I &s;ay, it mu&s;t not be by fore&s;eeing a continued chain of cau&s;es: For that would indeed de&s;troy their freedom. But it mu&s;t be a power, quite of another kind: a power, whereof we can only have an ob&s;ure glimp&s;e in &s;ome &s;uch manner as the following. What one man will freely do, upon any particular occa&s;ion, another man, by ob&s;er|vation and attention, may in &s;ome mea&s;ure judge; and the wi&s;er the per&s;on is, who makes the ob&s;ervation, the more probable will his judgment be, and the &s;eldomer will he be deceived. An angel, in the like ca&s;e, would make a judgment of the future event, as much nearer to certainty, than that of the wi&s;e&s;t man, as the angelic nature and faculties are &s;uperior to the human. In God him&s;elf, who&s;e powers are all in every re&s;pect infinitely tran&s;cending tho&s;e of the highe&s;t creatures; this judgment of future free actions, mu&s;t needs be infallible, that is, as truly certain (though entirely of a different kind) as that foreknowledge which he has of nece&s;&s;ary events, by &s;eeing their nece&s;&s;ary chain of cau&s;es: Nor ought it to appear &s;trange, that this divine foreknowledge of future free actions, &s;hould be entirely of a different nature, from his foreknowledge of nece&s;&s;ary events. For there is a not unlike di&s;tinction in &s;ome other of the divine attributes.&mdash; The omnipre&s;ence of GOD, is an attribute nece&s;&s;arily belonging to him, and altogether independent of his will. The goodne&s;s of GOD is like|wi&s;e a nece&s;&s;ary attribute, yet not in the &s;ame manner as his omnipre|&s;ence, by a mere ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of nature, but by the unalterable rec|titude of his will. This is the true rea&s;on why we return him thanks for being <HI>good,</HI> but not for being omnipre&s;ent. Thus both are nece&s;&s;ary, but by a nece&s;&s;ity of a totally different &s;ort or kind. In like manner, the foreknowledge of GOD, both that of nece&s;&s;ary, and that of free events, is in the i&s;&s;ue of things equally certain; yet in the one ca&s;e, this cer|tainty is entirely of a different nature from that in the other. It ari&s;es in the ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ary events from GOD's own fore-appointing a nece&s;&s;ary chain of cau&s;es to produce the&s;e events; but in the ca&s;e of <HI>free</HI> events it ari&s;es <HI>from</HI> and depends <HI>upon</HI> the mere futurity of the things them&s;elves. To illu&s;trate this matter by an example. That CHRIST, &s;hould die for the &s;ins of men, GOD not only fore-knew but fore-appointed it al&s;o, and &s;ent him into the world on purpo&s;e for that end. That Judas &s;hould betray our Savior, GOD foreknew, but did not fore-appoint it; only he cho&s;e on purpo&s;e, into the number of his di&s;ciples, one &s;uch per&s;on, the wickedne&s;s of who&s;e own heart, he <HI>&s;aw</HI> would prompt him to accompli&s;h that event. That Ahab &s;hould fall at Ramath-Gilead, GOD fore&s;aw, and fore-warned him of it; yet GOD's fore-knowledge did not make it nece&s;&s;ary for him, to go up and peri&s;h there; but the mere wickedne&s;s of his own will, de&s;pi&s;ing the divine admonition, as it was the only cau&s;e of the event, &s;o was it likewi&s;e the only ground of the fore-knowledge. And had Ahab been di&s;po&s;ed to repent at the advice of the Prophet, it was in his own power to have prevented his de&s;truction; and the fore-knowledge of God, would then have been accordingly the fore-knowledge of a con|trary event." The reader will pardon the length of the extract, when he con&s;iders that it could not have been &s;hortened without doing inju&s;tice to the rea&s;oning of the Author.</NOTE>.</P>

Finally, he directs <HI>Timothy,</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> to guard with care again&s;t &s;o dangerous a method of preaching.

I &s;hall now in the third place enquire into the rea&s;ons why mini&s;ters &s;ometimes do not
<PB N="19" REF="017449_0017_0FA11DDFD1143910">
preach according to the <HI>law</HI> and <HI>te&s;timony.</HI> It might be an&s;wered in general, that <HI>ignorance, inattention,</HI> and <HI>the cor|rupt principles of the human heart</HI> lead them a&s;tray. But I &s;hall be more particular, and an&s;wer fir&s;t, &s;ome per&s;ons mi&s;|repre&s;ent the doctrines of revelation, through de&s;ign, in order to accommodate them&s;elves to the corrupt humours of their hearers. Such is the abandoned temper of &s;ome teachers, that they will <HI>knowingly</HI> pervert the go&s;pel, that they may an&s;wer &s;ome wicked de&s;ign, or &s;ecure to them|&s;elves &s;ome worldly emolument. Per&s;ons that will thus conduct, are hereticks in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word. They are highly criminal in the &s;ight of GOD. To rea|&s;on with &s;uch men is vain; though it may be proper to ad|mini&s;ter to them, an whole&s;ome admonition or two. Hence &s;ays St. Paul, "an heretick after the fir&s;t and &s;econd ad|monition reject, knowing that he that is &s;uch, is &s;ubvert|ed and &s;inneth, being condemned of him&s;elf<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tit.</HI> iii. 10.</NOTE>". Charity obliges us to think there are but few &s;uch mini&s;ters at this day. Secondly, another rea&s;on why publick teachers mi&s;|repre&s;ent the truth, is their negligence in &s;tudying the &s;crip|tures. As the hu&s;bandman cannot cultivate his farm with|out proper uten&s;ils; &s;o neither is the preacher properly fur|ni&s;hed for his work, unle&s;s much acquainted which the &s;a|cred <HI>code,</HI> which is the foundation of the whole of his in|&s;tructions from the pulpit. In order to his having this acquaintance, much &s;tudy is nece&s;&s;ary. But as "&s;tudy is a wearine&s;s to the fle&s;h<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eccl.</HI> xii. 12.</NOTE>," &s;ome teachers content them|&s;elves with a carele&s;s and cur&s;ory reading the &s;criptures, which is by no means &s;ufficient to give us a clear and comprehen&s;ive knowledge of them. A&s;&s;iduous applica|tion is requi&s;ite for this purpo&s;e. Different pa&s;&s;ages &s;hould be compared with each other; the analogy of faith mu&s;t be pre&s;erved, a harmony maintained through the whole, and dark texts explained by tho&s;e that are more clear and intelligible. But alas! for want of this atten|tion, how horribly are the &s;criptures &s;ometimes perverted. The preacher is carried away by mere &s;ounds; and &s;trains texts to &s;uch unnatural &s;en&s;es, as are not only contrary to the general &s;cope of revelation, but &s;trike at the foundation of all religion. Through neglect of comparing one pa&s;|&s;age

with another; by rea&s;on of not attending to the ge|neral de&s;ign of the writer, the connexion of his di&s;cour&s;e, and the thread of his rea&s;oning, we rai&s;e doctrines upon incidental loo&s;e portions of &s;cripture, which contradict it's general tenor, and countenance immorality. The mi&s;take occa&s;ioned hereby, might be made evident by a variety of in&s;tances: I will mention a few. "What&s;oever is not of faith is &s;in<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> xiv. 23.</NOTE>". How often has this text been quoted to prove that whatever an unregenerate man does in re|ligion, is altogether &s;in, becau&s;e he is de&s;titute of true &s;av|ing faith in CHRIST? But if we carefully con&s;ult the context, will it not clearly appear, that it has no kind of reference to this matter? On the contrary, from &s;uch an examination, will it not be abundantly evident, that the rea&s;oning of St. Paul was only this, that with re&s;pect to a controver&s;y that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the <HI>judaizing</HI> and <HI>gentile</HI> chri&s;tians, concerning the lawfulne&s;s of ob&s;erving, or not ob&s;erving certain days, or of eating or not eating certain meats, they ought to be fully per&s;uaded in their own minds, and not go contrary to the belief of them; for though it was lawful under the go&s;pel, to eat all kinds of whole&s;ome meats; yet if any man thought otherwi&s;e, or even doubted the lawfulne&s;s of particular kinds of meat, and yet eat of them, he acted a &s;inful part, in going con|trary to the light of his own mind. He that doubteth is damned, that is, condemned in his own mind, if he eat, becau&s;e he eateth not of faith; for what&s;oever is not of faith, is &s;in.</P>
<P>Again, "who&s;oever will &s;ave his life &s;hall lo&s;e it, and who&s;oever &s;hall lo&s;e his life for my &s;ake, &s;hall find it<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> xvi. 25.</NOTE>." Has not this pa&s;&s;age al&s;o been greatly mi&s;repre&s;ented; either to &s;erve a particular favorite &s;cheme, or through neglect to con&s;ult the drift of our Saviour, in the chapter where he u&s;es it. Multitudes are &s;en&s;ible, that it has been of|ten u&s;ed in &s;upport of this &s;ingular opinion, viz. that if a man has any de&s;ire to &s;ecure his own &s;alvation by any acts of obedience he performs; nay, if he is not willing to forego his final happine&s;s, for the glory of GOD, and of CHRIST, he certainly &s;hall be damned! And yet, is it not &s;ufficiently evident from the connexion in which it
<PB N="21" REF="017449_0019_0FA11DE0B412B428">
&s;tands, that it means neither more nor le&s;s then this, that if a man through fear of temporal death, would renounce CHRIST and his go&s;pel, though by this means he might &s;ave his temporal, he &s;hould certainly lo&s;e his eter|nal life? I might ea&s;ily point out the perver&s;ion of many other pa&s;&s;ages of &s;acred writ, that have been mi&s;con&s;trued, either through inattention, or to &s;erve a particular turn; but the time would fail me. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that it cannot give us a very favorable opinion of &s;entiments, or doctrines, that have no other &s;upport in the bible than &s;uch texts, thus gro&s;sly mi&s;applied. Thirdly, Another rea&s;on why we do not &s;peak as the oracles of GOD, is that we come to the &s;tudy of them with prejudiced minds. This is a di&s;advantage we all, in a greater or le&s;s degree, labour under. A man totally free from prejudice, is no where to be found. There are cer|tain principles in the human heart, which imperceptibly lead us a&s;tray. We are always liable to be unduly bia&s;&s;|ed; but when young, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are mo&s;t apt to take place. The company we keep, the books we read in our juvenile years make a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion, and &s;ometimes &s;hackle the mind in &s;uch a manner, that it is with difficulty we get rid of the bias &s;o long as we live. We are formed for imitation; and whil&s;t incapable of judging for our&s;elves, we take our &s;entiments from tho&s;e, whom from their &s;ta|tions, and characters we are led to reverence. With &s;enti|ments thus previou&s;ly imbibed, we come to the &s;tudy of the &s;criptures. Therefore in&s;tead of enquiring impartially into the true meaning of them, with an upright de&s;ire to be acquainted with it, our bu&s;ine&s;s is rather to make them an eccho to our own voice, and accommodate them in the be&s;t manner we can to our pre-conceived &s;entiments. Pa&s;|&s;ages of revelation are hence tortured, wre&s;ted from their original de&s;ign, and made to &s;peak a language foreign from the intention of the writer.</P>
<P>Under this head of prejudice and the evil influence it has upon us, I &s;hall mention two particulars. Fir&s;t, Some men from this cau&s;e are unduly fond of the &s;enti|ments of the ancients, and will not be induced to believe any thing, on which <HI>they</HI> had not put the <HI>&s;tamp</HI> of <HI>ortho|doxy.</HI> The&s;e people have an undue reverence for anti|quity.

Happy indeed are we in having the opinions of our fathers delivered down to us in <HI>creeds</HI> and <HI>formularies,</HI> provided we make a di&s;creet u&s;e of them; but if they are &s;ub&s;cribed, and rigidly adhered to, as the &s;tandard of right opinion, they are then an in&s;uperable bar to any improvement in divine knowledge. We do well to avail our&s;elves of the writings and di&s;coveries of former times; but ought not to re&s;t contended with any attain|ments to which they had arrived. Modern improve|ments have been made in philo&s;ophy, juri&s;prudence, &amp;c. why not in divinity? There was a contrariety of &s;enti|ments even among the ancients; we ought to read both &s;ides of the controver&s;y; and from their interferings, as from the colli&s;ion of the flint and &s;teel, &s;hould labour to &s;trike out new light. In &s;hort, a blind attachment to mere hu|man creeds, hangs a dead weight upon the mind, fetters the native freedom of the &s;oul, prevents our impartial enquiries, and oftentimes greatly mi&s;leads. But, Secondly, Prejudice, in &s;ome per&s;ons has a quite contrary effect, and leads on the other hand, as far from the truth of &s;cripture. This is the ca&s;e of tho&s;e who would be thought more penetrating and &s;agacious than other people. Such per&s;ons take no &s;atisfaction in preaching that which others have preached before them. Their pride can content it&s;elf with nothing but what is <HI>new</HI> and <HI>&s;ingular.</HI> Thread bare

truth they hate. New and untrodden paths <HI>only</HI> can they brook to walk in. They love to &s;et the world a &s;taring by the novelty and &s;trangene&s;s of their a&s;&s;ertions. They love to be talked of, as men above vulgar prejudices, who act an independent part, and who think for them|&s;elves. To be tran&s;mitted down to po&s;terity, as the heads of a new <HI>&s;ect</HI> in religion, is an object &s;o tempting to their vanity that they cannot re&s;i&s;t it. Now to an&s;wer the&s;e purpo&s;es, to gratify their vanity, and to be thought wi&s;er than others, it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;trike out new walks of &s;cience, to broach new doctrines, and contradict the opi|nions of tho&s;e who have gone before them. If they think and preach like tho&s;e who went before them, what glory is it? But if they are the authors of new di&s;coveries; if they can unravel the <HI>Gordian knot</HI>; if they can account for the introduction of &s;in into the world, and explain <HI>that</HI> which has puzzled the brighte&s;t geniu&s;&s;es in former ages, then they an&s;wer their de&s;ign, they glory in their new invented divinity; and pertinaciou&s;ly adhere to <HI>that</HI> which &s;hocks the common &s;en&s;e of mankind in general. To &s;how that mankind have been in an error, even in the &s;malle&s;t matter, and to point out their mi&s;take, is &s;ome gratification to their vanity; but to prove that they have been in a mi&s;take in <HI>religion,</HI> which is a matter of univer|&s;al concern, for eighteen hundred years pa&s;t, affords to them matter of exultation and triumph! From &s;uch a &s;ource as this, &s;ome per&s;ons of vain and empty minds, deviate from the &s;cripture, and teach for doctrines not the truths of revelation, but the dictates of their own vanity and pride.&mdash;<HI>Fourthly, and la&s;tly.</HI> The la&s;t rea&s;on I &s;hall mention, why mini&s;ters depart from the <HI>law</HI> and <HI>the te&s;ti|mony</HI> is, their not &s;ettling before-hand ju&s;t &s;entiments of the <HI>Deity.</HI> Did we conceive of him, as we ought, as a be|ing of <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> of <HI>holine&s;s</HI> and infinite <HI>benevolence,</HI> we could not po&s;&s;ibly believe that a revelation from him, could contain &s;uch doctrines, as are &s;ometimes preached. Under the notion of exalting his &s;overeignty, we &s;hould by no means repre&s;ent him as cruel and tyrannical, merci|le&s;s and capricious. Whether this has not been done by &s;ome, I leave others to judge.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="017449_0022_0FA11DE2F328B9B8">I &s;hall apply the whole that has been &s;aid, to the mini&s;ters now pre&s;ent, and to the people who hear them. Fir&s;t, to the mini&s;ters. You will permit me, my reve|rend Fathers and Brethren, to ob&s;erve that it becomes us to be very careful how we &s;tudy the holy &s;criptures: with what tempers we come to the &s;tudy of them. There are many principles in the human heart that may lead us in&s;en&s;ibly to wre&s;t and pervert the &s;acred oracles. We &s;hould, therefore, watch over our own hearts, mortify our pride, our vanity, and every other pa&s;&s;ion that makes us aver&s;e to the truth, as it is in JESUS. The prevailing temper of the heart has an amazing influence on the &s;enti|ments of the head. Thus the pride of the heart is brought with difficulty to &s;ubmit to &s;ome of the humbling doctrines of the go&s;pel. How hard is it to con&s;ent to re|ceive &s;alvation as the free gift of GOD? Again, a man of a &s;elfi&s;h temper greatly devoid of benevolence, after having placed him&s;elf in the number of the elect, readily adopts the groundle&s;s doctrine of per&s;onal, unconditional reprobation; and contemplates with plea&s;ure the inevita|ble damnation of millions of his fellow men; and &s;o in an hundred other in&s;tances. It becomes us therefore, as public teachers of religion to exerci&s;e a godly jealou&s;y over our&s;elves, and labour to bring with us to the &s;tudy of the &s;criptures, an <HI>open, candid, meek</HI> and <HI>teachable</HI> tem|per. "The meek GOD will guide in judgment, the meek he will teach his way<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot"><HI>P&s;al.</HI> xxv. 9.</NOTE>". A di&s;po&s;ition to do the will of GOD is the be&s;t preparative for the right un|der&s;tanding the doctrines of chri&s;tianity. CHRIST &s;ays, if any man will do his will, he &s;hall know of the doctrine, whether it be of GOD, or whether I &s;peak of my&s;elf<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> vii. 17.</NOTE>. Accordingly &s;ays Daniel, "none of the wicked &s;hall un|der&s;tand, but the wi&s;e &s;hall under&s;tand<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dan.</HI> xxii. 10.</NOTE>". The pre-dominancy of lu&s;t and pa&s;&s;ion &s;huts up the avenues of the &s;oul, and bars the entrance of divine truth; it warps and di&s;torts the mind, and leads to gro&s;s mi&s;conceptions. As we cannot but be &s;en&s;ible of this, it &s;hould be our con|&s;tant endeavour to mortify the evil propen&s;ities of our hearts, and with meekne&s;s receive and di&s;pen&s;e the ingraf|ted word, which is able to &s;ave our &s;ouls". It &s;hould,
<PB N="25" REF="017449_0023_0FA11DE3B2DFD590">
moreover, be our great concern to dive&s;t our minds of all prejudicate opinions, not fir&s;t &s;ettle our &s;entiments and then examine, as is too often the ca&s;e; but examine with impartiality and care, in order to our being grounded and e&s;tabli&s;hed in the faith. And in this examination let us make the Bible the &s;tandard, receiving that more than the mo&s;t re&s;pectable human authority; being per&s;uaded that the fir&s;t is unerring; the la&s;t fallible and precarious. Finally, we &s;hould add our fervent addre&s;&s;es to the GOD of all grace for the illumination and guidance of his Holy Spirit, that we may be pre&s;erved from all dangerous errors, may know the truth our&s;elves, and be faithful di&s;pen&s;ors of it to others; for truly dreadful is it to mi&s;lead, either through ignorance or pa&s;&s;ion, tho&s;e <HI>who &s;eek the law at our mouths.</HI> Again&s;t the errors of teachers there is one &s;ecurity, and that is, the right under&s;tanding of their hearers in divine things. An intelligent people are rare|ly impo&s;ed upon by fal&s;e and erronious preachers. But be this as it will, certainly people are not obliged impli|citly to believe <HI>all</HI> that is delivered to them from the de&s;k. They have the Bible in their hands, written in a language which they under&s;tand, and by <HI>this</HI> they are to judge, whether what they hear be true or not. To you therefore who hear, I &s;hall in the Second place, apply my&s;elf. Suffer me, my brethren to &s;ay, that mini&s;ters "have no dominion over your faith, but are only helpers of your joy<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">2. <HI>Cor.</HI> i. 24.</NOTE>". You have not only a <HI>right,</HI> but it is your <HI>duty</HI> to judge for your&s;elves. "Prove all things, hold fa&s;t that which is good." "Believe not every &s;pirit, but try the &s;pirits whether they are of GOD; becau&s;e many fal&s;e prophets are gone out into the world." It was the commendation of the <HI>Bereans,</HI> that they &s;earched the &s;criptures <HI>daily,</HI> to &s;ee whether the things &s;poken by the apo&s;tles, were &s;o or not. It mu&s;t be equally to the prai&s;e of any other people, if they &s;ee with their own eyes, and compare the doctrines that are delivered to them from time to time, with the Bible, the only unerring &s;tandard. Implicit faith is degrading to the human mind. It argues a ba&s;e and &s;ervile temper. Hence, &s;earching the &s;crip|tures, to put us into a capacity to judge of the &s;entiments
<PB N="26" REF="017449_0024_0FA11DE471FE37C0">
that are advanced to us by our teachers, is a mark of a noble and ingenuous &s;oul, that will not be hood-winked or &s;hackled by authority. I &s;ay not this to excite a <HI>carp|ing, captious</HI> &s;pirit in hearers, of which there is full enough at pre&s;ent; but only to influence to a <HI>rational, diligent</HI> and <HI>manly</HI> examination of the word of GOD; and to enable them to &s;ee when the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel is preached, or contradicted by their mini&s;ters. To enable you to make this examination to any valuable purpo&s;e, &s;everal things are nece&s;&s;ary. Fir&s;t, a good and an hone&s;t heart, di&s;po&s;ed to keep the divine commands, will give you great in&s;ight into the will of GOD. <HI>David</HI> could &s;ay, I "have more under&s;tanding than all my teachers; for thy te&s;timonies are my meditation; I under&s;tand more than the ancients, becau&s;e I keep thy precepts<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot"><HI>P&s;al.</HI> cxix. 99, 100.</NOTE>". Secondly, It will be a mighty help to you in the under&s;tanding of &s;cripture in the dark and my&s;terious parts thereof, to &s;ettle and en|tertain in your minds right conceptions of the divine character. Thirdly, Remember that revelation was given not to introduce &s;peculative and curious opinions into the world, but to rectify the di&s;orders, and better the temper of the human heart. Fouthly, Lay it down as a maxim, that no doctrines can come from GOD, a being of infi|nite purity and holine&s;s, which in the lea&s;t degree tolerate or tend to encourage <HI>vice</HI> and <HI>immorality.</HI> Fifthly, That revelation is founded in <HI>rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>common &s;en&s;e,</HI> and there|fore that none of its doctrines can contradict either the one or the other; however, &s;ome of them may be above our comprehen&s;ion. <HI>That</HI> people who &s;hall attentively &s;tudy the &s;cripture agreeably to the rules and directions laid down in this di&s;cour&s;e, will be out of all danger of being carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the &s;light of men, and cunning craftine&s;s whereby they lie in wait to deceive<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> vi. 14.</NOTE>". I am con&s;trained to add, that a people well acquainted with the revealed will of GOD, will not ea&s;ily dige&s;t, or be reconciled to certain doctrines that have been propagated late in <HI>&s;ome</HI> of our <HI>Pari&s;hes.</HI> The <HI>Pastors and Deacons,</HI> who have in this place taken much pains to become acquainted with the religious

&s;entiments of the Rev. Mr. SCRIBNER; are, in general fully per&s;uaded that he has either <HI>publickly</HI> or <HI>privately</HI> advanced &s;ome &s;entiments, not only un&s;upported by &s;cripture, but al&s;o of a dangerous nature, and tendency. In particular, they conceive that he is dangerou&s;ly erronious in the two following points. Fir&s;t, in what he has &s;aid concerning &s;in's being the object of GOD's choice, and agreeable to his will. And Secondly, in &s;aying that the <HI>unregenerate</HI> have no right to attend the <HI>means of grace</HI>: Notwith&s;tanding Mr. SCRIBNER'S explanations or &s;oftenings of the&s;e heads, yet it finally did appear, that the &s;entiments he advanced, relative to the above particulars, were &s;uch, as not only could not be defended, but were really contrary to the very &s;pirit and genius of chri&s;tianity.&mdash;It mu&s;t be thought a matter of the highe&s;t importance, to entertain right conceptions of the deity. We are taught to conceive of him as a being of infinite purity and holine&s;s; but if &s;in, in any view of it be agreeable to him; if it was introduced into the world, by his influence, efficiency or creation, how can we recon|cile this with his <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> purity and holine&s;s? How can we reconcile it with his ju&s;tice to puni&s;h <HI>that</HI> in his crea|tures, which they did through his efficiency, and in the ex|ecution of his own will? How, with his holine&s;s to create, or effect, to will or choo&s;e <HI>that</HI> which is directly contrary to holine&s;s? The di&s;tinctions that have been made in re|lation to this &s;ubject, appear to be altogether futile; &s;uch as that, <HI>the &s;infulne&s;s of &s;in, and &s;in in its own nature,</HI> are di&s;plea&s;ing to GOD. Do not the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions imply that there is a kind of holine&s;s, or goodne&s;s in &s;in; and that &s;in out of it's own nature, is the object of GOD's choice? To introduce &s;uch uncouth phra&s;eology into popular &s;ermons; to de&s;turb the natural ideas that man|kind have of GOD, to di&s;tingui&s;h and &s;ubtilize beyond the limits of common &s;en&s;e, mu&s;t certainly be a very un|profitable way, a very dangerous method of preaching. But it will be &s;aid, that the &s;cripture repre&s;ents GOD as encouraging and promoting &s;in. I mu&s;t confe&s;s there are many pa&s;&s;ages which &s;eem to countenance the very &s;enti|ment I am now exploding. Thus we read that GOD.

That this is the meaning of the above quoted &s;crip|tures, and that they do not intend that GOD makes men wicked by his own po&s;itive influence, mu&s;t be evident from what is &s;aid in other parts of the <HI>bible.</HI> Thus, what is figuratively &s;aid to be done by GOD, 2. Samuel xxiv. 1&s;t. is, with greater accuracy of expre&s;&s;ion, attributed to &s;atan, 1&s;t. Chronicles xxi. And &s;atan &s;tood up again&s;t <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and provoked <HI>David</HI> to number <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> Accord|ingly, St. <HI>Peter</HI> &s;ays to <HI>Ananias,</HI> why hath <HI>&s;atan</HI> (not why hath GOD) filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Gho&s;t<NOTE N="(w)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Acts</HI> v. 3.</NOTE>."
