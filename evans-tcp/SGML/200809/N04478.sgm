religious Man, a true Wor&s;hipper of the true GOD. He was born indeed of <HI>Gentile</HI> Parents; and, 'tis probable, they educated him in the <HI>Super&s;titions</HI> and <HI>Idolatries</HI> of the <HI>Pagan</HI> Nations. But the&s;e he renounced, and became a <HI>Pro&s;elyte</HI> to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Religion; acknowledging the GOD of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to be the true GOD, and wor&s;hipping him as &s;uch, according to the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> In&s;titution, with an upright Heart.</P>
<P>He did not wor&s;hip he <HI>knew not what.</HI> His Devotion would then have been blind, and nothing better than <HI>Super&s;tition.</HI> So the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> told the <HI>Athenians,</HI> when he &s;aw them paying their Devotions to an unknown Object. <HI>Ye Men of</HI> Athens, (&s;ays he, <HI>Acts&punc;</HI> 17&punc; 22, 23.) <HI>I perceive <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> all Things ye are too &s;uper&s;titious. For as I pa&s;&s;ed by, and beheld your Devotions, I found an Altar with this In&s;cription,</HI> TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. <HI>Whom therefore ye ignorantly wor&s;hip, him declare I unto you.</HI> Neither did he mi&s;take the <HI>proper Ob|ject</HI> of Wor&s;hip; doing Service to an <HI>Idol,</HI> in&s;tead of the GOD who made Heaven and Earth, and is over all GOD ble&s;&s;ed for ever: He would then have de&s;erved the Character of an <HI>idolatrous,</HI> not a pious devout Man. But the Being he did Homage to was the GOD of the <HI>Univer&s;e,</HI> the GOD of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> the <HI>one true</HI> and <HI>living</HI> GOD; be&s;ides whom there is no other &s;utable Object of religious Adoration.</P>
<P>And he wor&s;hipped the true GOD according to <HI>his own Appointments.</HI> 'Tis true, he does not appear to have been what the <HI>Jews</HI> call, a <HI>Pro&s;elyte of the Covenant,</HI> i. e. one who had &s;ubmitted to <HI>Circumci&s;ion,</HI> and the <HI>whole Mo&s;aic In&s;titutions,</HI> and was counted as a <HI>Jew,</HI> and conver&s;ed with as &s;uch.

He was no ob&s;erver either of <HI>Heatheni&s;h Rites</HI> or <HI>Jewi&s;h Traditions.</HI> He did not go about to <HI>invent</HI> Methods of plea&s;ing GOD, as tho' tho&s;e of his own in&s;tituting were not &s;ufficient.

indeed has been too much the Way of the World in all pa&s;t Ages, and is &s;o at this Day. The <HI>Church of Rome</HI> has inven|ted <HI>Pilgrimages, Penances, Proce&s;&s;ions,</HI> and numberle&s;s other Super&s;titions; adding them to tho&s;e Exerci&s;es of Piety the <HI>Scripture</HI> has pointed out: Yea, they have introduced the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> and an hundred other Saints both dead and alive, as &s;o many <HI>Mediums</HI> of Approach to the divine Maje&s;ty, to the great Di&s;honour, if not Exclu&s;ion, of JESUS the <HI>one Me|diator between God and Man.</HI> And what Multitudes of poor deluded People are there, who think them&s;elves, and would be tho't by others, eminently devout and pious, becau&s;e they are religiou&s;ly &s;trict in the&s;e and &s;uch like Ob&s;ervances? CORNELIUS'S Devotion was not of this Kind. He &s;acredly adhered to the Pre&s;criptions of the <HI>Bible;</HI> thinking it enough, if he exerci&s;ed him&s;elf in tho&s;e Acts of Religion GOD had <HI>appointed.</HI> The&s;e he looked upon as bearing the Stamp of divine Authority; and the&s;e he ob&s;erved, hoping for the Pre|&s;ence and Ble&s;&s;ing of his Maker.</P>
<P>And as he wor&s;hipped the true GOD in his own Way, &s;o he took Care to do it with an <HI>hone&s;t Mind,</HI> having a <HI>&s;ingle Eye to the divine Glory.</HI> He did not honour GOD with his Lips, while his Heart was far from him; he did not flatter him with his Mouth, or lie to him with his Tongue, his Heart not be|ing right with him: But he was &s;incere in his religious Per|formances; the Man <HI>inwardly</HI> he &s;eemed to be <HI>outwardly.</HI> He did not put on Religion as a Cloak, nor wear the Form of it becau&s;e it was the Fa&s;hion; but he had a real Regard for GOD, and from this Principle ob&s;erved his <HI>Sabbath,</HI> went up to his <HI>Sanctuary,</HI> and attended the Duties of his <HI>Wor&s;hip.</HI> Nor did he content him&s;elf with the <HI>outward</HI> Exerci&s;es of Re|ligion, but his chief Concern was with his Heart, that he might <HI>inwardly</HI> honour GOD by unfeigned Acts of Faith in him, Love to him and Dependance on him.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="005556_0007_1018672CDF4D8108">
Thus CORNELIUS was a <HI>devout,</HI> i. e. a pious religious Man. But the Text is particular in mentioning two ob&s;er|vable In&s;tances of his <HI>Piety</HI> or <HI>Devotion;</HI> his <HI>fearing God with all his Hou&s;e, and his praying always.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> In&s;tance is, his <HI>fearing God with all his Hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>By this <HI>Fear of</HI> GOD, we mu&s;t not under&s;tand that Un|ea&s;ine&s;s of Mind, which is the Re&s;ult of an Apprehen&s;ion of him, as <HI>meerly</HI> a powerful and angry Being. This is a wrong Notion of the DEITY. And a Fear of him ari&s;ing from &s;uch a fal&s;e Conception, is nothing better than &s;uper&s;titious Awe and Dread.</P>
<P>Neither by this <HI>Fear of</HI> GOD are we to under&s;tand that <HI>Perturbation of Mind,</HI> which is founded on Con&s;ideration of tho&s;e many Sins, whereby we have expos'd our &s;elves to the divine Re&s;entments. This indeed is a rea&s;onable <HI>Fear of</HI> GOD; tho' whenever Men, thro' a Sen&s;e of Sin, &s;o employ their Thoughts on his <HI>&s;everer</HI> Attributes, as to forget his <HI>milder</HI> Ones, e&s;pecially as he has made a Repre&s;entation of them in the Go&s;pel of his SON JESUS CHRIST; and are &s;o over|whelmed with a Dread of his <HI>Anger,</HI> as to have no Hope in his Mercy, this is meer <HI>Horror of Soul,</HI> founded on fal&s;e Ideas of GOD, &s;uch as are neither fetched from <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> nor <HI>Scrip|ture:</HI> And the Tendency of it is, not to bring Men to GOD by Repentance, but to drive them away from him thro' Fright and De&s;pair.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides the&s;e Sen&s;es of the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> there is yet another; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>an humble Awe and Reverence of him,</HI> accompa|nied with <HI>Love</HI> to him, and con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>&s;weet Delight</HI> in him. The <HI>Subjects</HI> of this Fear are <HI>good Men:</HI> The <HI>Founda|tion</HI> of it, ju&s;t Conceptions of GOD; a due Con&s;ideration of his Maje&s;ty and Power, as tempered with Compa&s;&s;ion and Grace: And in whom&s;oever it re&s;ides, it di&s;po&s;es them to
<PB N="10" REF="005556_0008_1018672E6C5E5A48">
plea&s;e GOD, and re&s;trains them from every Thing offen&s;ive to him, or that would argue a Neglect or Contempt of him. This is that <HI>filial</HI> Fear of GOD which is &s;o much celebrated in the <HI>Scripture:</HI> And in this Sen&s;e it was, that CORNELIUS <HI>feared him.</HI></P>
<P>He had upon his Mind an habitual Awe of GOD; not &s;uch an one as drove him from his <HI>Pre&s;ence;</HI> not &s;uch an one as made his Life uncomfortable to him: But his Reverence of the divine Maje&s;ty was mixed with Love to him, and a <HI>Child|like</HI> Confidence in him. And it had a powerful Tendency to keep him from every Thing di&s;re&s;pectful towards GOD, either in Thought, Speech or Behaviour; and to put him upon expre&s;&s;ing the lowe&s;t Pro&s;tration both of Body and Soul before him: As in Children who have in their Minds a true Fear of their <HI>Parents;</HI> the Influence of this Pa&s;&s;ion is not to fill them with a flavi&s;h unea&s;y Dread, but it tends rather to engage their Care to behave towards them with all dutiful Submi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>'Tis added in Commendation of CORNELIUS'S <HI>Fear of God,</HI> that it had a good influence upon his whole Family. <HI>He feared God with his whole Hou&s;e.</HI> His Religion was not confin'd to him&s;elf; but all under his Roof were the better for it. It may be, they al&s;o <HI>feared God.</HI> It was the Happi|ne&s;s of &s;everal pious Men in that Day, to have their <HI>whole Hou&s;es</HI> converted together with them&s;elves, and brought over to the Profe&s;&s;ion of the true Religion. So we read of the <HI>Noble-man</HI> at <HI>Capernaum,</HI> (<HI>John</HI> 4. 5<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.) that he <HI>him&s;elf believed, and his Hou&s;e;</HI> and of <HI>Cri&s;pus</HI> the Ruler of the Synagogue, (<HI>Acts</HI> 18. 8.) that he <HI>believed on the Lord with all his Hou&s;e.</HI> And 'tis a Salutation &s;ometimes to be met with in the Epi&s;tles, (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 16. 19.) <HI>To &s;uch an one, and the Church in his Hou&s;e;</HI> importing, that the Family was converted, as it were, into a <HI>Church</HI> of CHRIST. And 'tis po&s;&s;ible, this might be the Ca&s;e
<PB N="11" REF="005556_0009_101867303B5B0D98">
of CORNELIUS'S Family. His Piety might have an Influence, under the divine Ble&s;&s;ing, to diffu&s;e Religion thro' his whole Hou&s;e. Or however this was, as became a true <HI>Fearer of God,</HI> he took all proper Care, that his Family might be a <HI>re|ligious</HI> One. He, no doubt, in&s;tructed them in the Know|ledge, and urg'd them to the Service of GOD: He, no doubt, &s;et up the Wor&s;hip of the GOD of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in his Family; re|&s;olving with <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> of Old, <HI>As for me and my Hou&s;e, we will &s;erve the Lord:</HI> He, no doubt, di&s;couraged the out-breaking of Sin in his Children and Servants; warning them again&s;t it, and laying the Re&s;traints of his Authority upon their Lu&s;ts and Vices: He, no doubt, carried them to the Throne of Mercy, humbly and fervently praying to GOD for them, and teaching them to pray to him them&s;elves: Nor can it be &s;uppo&s;ed but he recommended Religion to their Love and Practice, from his own <HI>exemplary</HI> good Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>And what a noble Evidence was this of the Truth of his Piety? 'Tis particularly mentioned to <HI>Abraham'</HI>s Honour, and as <HI>that</HI> whereby GOD knew him to be a pious holy Man, that he took all &s;utable Care to promote Religion in his <HI>Family. I know him</HI> (&s;ays God, <HI>Gen.</HI> 18. 19.), <HI>that he will command his Children and his Hou&s;hold after him, and they &s;hall keep the Way of the Lord, to do Ju&s;tice and Judgment.</HI> And the like Commendation is here given of CORNELIUS, whereby he is declared to be a <HI>&s;piritual</HI> Son of <HI>Abraham,</HI> a Partaker of his virtuous Di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The next In&s;tance the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> gives of CORNELIUS'S Piety, is, <HI>his praying always.</HI> Not that he &s;pent his whole Time in praying. This he could not do; it was not con&s;i&s;tent with the Frame of his Nature, nor with many Duties that are nece&s;&s;ary as well as Prayer: But the Meaning is, he was a Man of Prayer, di&s;pos'd to the Duty, and much us'd to the Practice of it.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="005556_0010_10186738BAD5D808">
He <HI>prayed always,</HI> i. e. He was always in a Frame for Prayer; habitually inclined to this noble Exerci&s;e of Piety. He was ever ready to open his Lips, that he might make known his Reque&s;ts to GOD. This was the &s;ettled perma|nent Di&s;po&s;ition of his Mind.</P>
<P>He <HI>prayed always,</HI> i. e. It was his frequent Practice, the daily Employment of his Life. With the devout <HI>P&s;almi&s;t,</HI> he began and ended the Day with GOD; &s;hewing forth his Loving-Kindne&s;s in the Morning, and his Faithfulne&s;s every Night. And 'tis ob&s;ervable, the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> which GOD ap|pointed to be <HI>daily</HI> offered in the <HI>Morning</HI> and in the <HI>Evening,</HI> is called the <HI>continual Burnt-offering</HI> (Numb. 28. 6.); and for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, and with like Propriety, Prayers <HI>daily</HI> put up to GOD, <HI>Morning</HI> and <HI>Evening,</HI> may be called <HI>continual praying, praying always.</HI></P>
<P>He <HI>prayed always,</HI> i. e. upon all proper and fit Occa&s;ions. He did not confine him&s;elf to &s;tated Sea&s;ons for Prayer; but ey'd the Face of Providence, and betook him&s;elf to GOD in humble Supplication, as new Occa&s;ions called for it. He, no doubt, had his Days of more &s;olemn Prayer, in a Way of <HI>Humiliation</HI> and <HI>Thank&s;giving,</HI> as his <HI>own</HI> Circum&s;tances, or the Affairs of the <HI>Public,</HI> made them &s;ea&s;onable and nece&s;|&s;ary. Nor was he a Stranger to <HI>Ejaculatory</HI> Prayer. We may rather &s;uppo&s;e, it was his Practice, in this Way, to lift up his Heart to GOD in devout Acknowledgments, as fre&s;h Occa|&s;ions were offered therefor, from what he daily met with in the Cour&s;e of Providence.</P>
<P>He <HI>prayed always,</HI> i. e. he prayed and did not faint; he prayed without growing weary of the Duty. He did not, as the Manner of &s;ome is, practice it for a while, and then lay it a&s;ide; but <HI>continued in Supplication, watching thereunto with all Per&s;everance.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="005556_0011_1018673D1AD68F48">
And, I may add, he &s;o prayed, with &s;uch Faith, Humility, Sincerity, Submi&s;&s;ion and holy Fervour of Soul, that his Prayers were graciou&s;ly accepted of GOD. So he was a&s;&s;u|red by the <HI>Angel of the Lord,</HI> who &s;aid unto him (Context v. 4.), <HI>thy Prayers are come up for a Memorial before God.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have &s;et before you the Character of CORNELIUS, as a <HI>devout religious Man.</HI></P>
<P>And have we not rea&s;on herefrom to reflect upon our &s;elves with Grief and Shame, that we fall &s;o far below him in true Piety? The be&s;t of us all may blu&s;h, while we &s;ee our &s;elves reproved by the <HI>Example</HI> of one, who&s;e Attainments in Reli|gion were &s;o con&s;iderable, under &s;maller Advantages than ours, who, from Children, have been favoured with the Go&s;|pel, and all the external Privileges of the Kingdom of GOD. O how languid is our Devotion! How &s;light the Awe of our Minds towards the divine Maje&s;ty! How feeble its In|fluence to re&s;train and govern us! How cold and lifele&s;s are our Prayers! How remi&s;s our Endeavours to promote Reli|gion, either in <HI>our Selves,</HI> or our <HI>Hou&s;es!</HI></P>
<P>And are there not tho&s;e who give too much Rea&s;on to be lamented over, as having no true <HI>Fear of</HI> GOD before their Eyes? Why el&s;e are they &s;o indifferent to the Duties of Piety? Why do they &s;o often prophane the <HI>Name,</HI> and ca&s;t Contempt upon the <HI>Day</HI> and <HI>Sanctuary</HI> of GOD? Why el&s;e are they &s;o indi&s;po&s;ed to <HI>Prayer,</HI> and &s;eldom engaged in this nece&s;&s;ary Exerci&s;e of Religion? It may be, there are &s;ome who never in all their Life entred into their Clo&s;ets, to put up a Prayer to almighty GOD! And can it be &s;aid of &s;uch, that they reverence their Maker? If Men <HI>re&s;train Prayer before</HI> GOD, 'tis a &s;ad Sign they have <HI>ca&s;t off the Fear of him.</HI> (Job 15. 4.) And to this al&s;o it is owing, that &s;o little Religion, or good Order, is to be &s;een in many of the Families of the pre&s;ent Age. How unin&s;tructed are their Children and Ser|vants?
<PB N="14" REF="005556_0012_1018673F39D9C4C8">
How unu&s;ed to good Coun&s;el and &s;erious Advice? How let alone to go on in the Ways of Sin, without Correc|tion or Re&s;traint? And are there no Families where GOD was never wor&s;hipped? Are there no Families, where the <HI>Heads</HI> of them, in&s;tead of Religion, encourage Vice by their evil Example, by their Prophane&s;s, their Intemperance, their In|ju&s;tice, their Pride, their ungovern'd Wrath and Pa&s;&s;ion? How unlike are &s;uch to devout CORNELIUS, <HI>who feared</HI> GOD <HI>with his whole Hou&s;e?</HI></P>
<P>O &s;ee your &s;elves condemned by his Example! And let me per&s;wade you from it to <HI>fear God your &s;elves,</HI> and then to do what you can to po&s;&s;e&s;s your <HI>whole Hou&s;es</HI> of the like religious Temper of Mind.</P>
<P>Charity, we &s;ay, begins at home. Your Religion, be &s;ure, mu&s;t do &s;o. See to it that you be <HI>your&s;elves</HI> Men of true Piety and Devotion; and approve your&s;elves &s;uch, by a con&s;tant Attendance on all the divine Appointments.&mdash;<HI>Exerci&s;e your &s;elves to Godline&s;s;</HI> but take Care that it be'nt that <HI>bodily Ex|erci&s;e which profiteth little.</HI>&mdash;Don't content your&s;elves with an <HI>external Shew;</HI> Don't ob&s;erve the In&s;titutions of Religion meerly to <HI>be &s;een of Men:</HI> But look well to your <HI>Aims,</HI> that they be <HI>good;</HI> and to your <HI>Hearts,</HI> that they be <HI>&s;incere.</HI> Take diligent Heed, that you may &s;erve the Lord with all your Heart, and with all your Soul; for the Lord &s;earcheth the Heart, and hath Plea&s;ure in Uprightne&s;s.</P>
<P>And being religious <HI>your &s;elves,</HI> give Proof that you are &s;o by &s;utable Endeavours to promote Religion in your <HI>Families.</HI> Like CORNELIUS, <HI>Fear God with your whole Hou&s;e.</HI> Let this be your faithful diligent Endeavour.</P>
<P>You can in no other Way expect <HI>Comfort</HI> in your Families. If <HI>Family-Religion</HI> is neglected, what may be looked for but an untowardly Temper and Conduct, in the &s;everal Members of

it? The Effect whereof mu&s;t be Di&s;order, Vexation, and Trouble: Whereas, if Religion is duly kept up in the Family, it will powerfully tend to correct the bad Di&s;po&s;itions, whe|ther of Children or Servants, and engage them to behave well in their re&s;pective Places. And if this, under the divine In|fluence, &s;hould be the Effect, what happy Families &s;hould we have? GOD would delight to dwell in them, to do them Good and not Evil.</P>
<P>And 'tis a Matter of va&s;t Importance to the <HI>Public,</HI> that Religion be maintained in <HI>Families;</HI> e&s;pecially that the <HI>Chil|dren</HI> in them be well in&s;tructed and governed. Their <HI>good</HI> or <HI>evil</HI> Behaviour, when they are grown up, and gone forth into the World, will very much depend upon the Care that has been taken of them, while <HI>Children</HI> in the Family. If they have been early taught the Principles of Virtue; if their Minds have been betimes impre&s;&s;ed with the Fear of GOD; if, from their fir&s;t coming to a Capacity of <HI>moral</HI> Conduct, they have been kept under Re&s;traints from Sin; if they have, all along as they grew up, had a good Example &s;et before them, there will be a happy Pro&s;pect of their ri&s;ing up a Generation to &s;eek and &s;erve the Lord. The&s;e are the Children that are the Hopes of a Country, and of whom it may be expected they will be Ble&s;&s;ings in the World. Whereas, on the other Hand, if they are neglected, little or no Care taken to engage them for GOD, and inure them to the Exerci&s;es of Religion, what may be expected but that they &s;hould prove the <HI>Troublers of I&s;rael?</HI> And the evil Effects of their bad Education may be of la&s;ting Continuance. For, when tho&s;e Children who have not been trained up in the Ways of Piety, come to have Chil|dren them&s;elves, 'tis mo&s;t probable they will neglect them, take no Care to plant in their Minds the Seeds of Religion; and, by this Means, the Generation which &s;prings out of their Loins will be likely to tread in their Steps, and &s;o Vice and
<PB N="16" REF="005556_0014_101867459D73FA60">
Ignorance, Prophane&s;s and Irreligion, will de&s;cend from Chil|dren to Children's Children, GOD only knows how long.</P>
<P>In a Word, 'tis a great Charge that is devolved on you who have the chief Direction of Families. You are, in a Mea&s;ure, accountable for the Souls of your <HI>whole Hou&s;es</HI> as well as your own. And the Day is coming, it ha&s;tens apace, it lingers not, when it will certainly be demanded of you, what Care you have taken to walk in your Hou&s;e with a per|fect Heart; what Pains you have been at to train up your Children and Servants for GOD; what In&s;tructions, Coun&s;els and Warnings you have given them; what Prayers you have put up to GOD for them: And if it &s;hould then appear, that you neither &s;erved GOD, <HI>your &s;elves,</HI> nor endeavoured that your <HI>Families</HI> might do &s;o; But neglected their Souls, as well as your own: You won't be able to an&s;wer it to GOD, or them. If thro' your Neglect of <HI>Family-Religion,</HI> or, what is wor&s;e, the Influence of your bad <HI>Family-Example,</HI> your Chil|dren or Servants &s;hould peri&s;h in another World, O what a doleful Account would you have to give up at the Bar of CHRIST! And &s;hould any of them there charge upon you the Ruin of their Souls, could you be able to bear up under it? Don't the Fore-thought of &s;uch an Accu&s;ation &s;trike you with &s;huddering Horror?&mdash;<HI>But, Beloved, we are per&s;waded better Things of you, and Things that accompany Salvation; tho' we thus &s;peak.</HI></P>
<P>II. The next Thing ob&s;ervable in CORNELIUS'S Character is, his <HI>Charity</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> towards Men, together with the <HI>good Reputation</HI> he had gained in the World.</P>
<P>He was a Man of <HI>Charity;</HI> ready to di&s;tribute, willing to communicate: And he was large and generous in his Di&s;tributions. So the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> de&s;cribes him, <HI>Which gave much Alms to the People.</HI> He does not appear to have been a Man of a va&s;t Income; but yet, in Proportion to what he had, he did
<PB N="17" REF="005556_0015_101867472377C5E0">
a great deal for the Poor. 'Tis probable, he lived frugally in his Family, retrenching all needle&s;s as well as &s;inful Expences, that he might have it in his Power to be thus beneficent. He was not like many Chri&s;tians, in the&s;e Days, who can &s;ee their Brethren have Need, and &s;hut up their Bowels of Com|pa&s;&s;ion; neither was he charitable in Word and Tongue only, but in Deed and in Truth. If he &s;aw a Brother or Si&s;ter naked, or de&s;titute of daily Food, he did not content him&s;elf with &s;aying unto them, Be ye warmed, be ye filled; but as far as his Ability would reach, gave them tho&s;e Things which are needful for the Body.</P>
<P>And he was, no doubt, prompted hereto from a truly <HI>bene|volent Heart.</HI> Had he &s;ounded a Trumpet before him, when he did his Alms, that he might have Glory of Men; had he opened his Hand to relieve the Poor, not from a Principle of real Love to his Neighbour, but to &s;erve his own Ends;&mdash;it would not have been declared to him from Heaven, <HI>that his Alms were come up for a Memorial before God.</HI> The merciful GOD accepted his Charities to the Poor: We may therefore be &s;ure they Proceeded from a truly charitable Mind. He was not one of tho&s;e hard-hearted Men, who could not be touched with a Fellow-Feeling of his Neighbour's Mi&s;eries; he was not one of tho&s;e &s;ordid Creatures, who imagine all is lo&s;t that is not laid out upon them&s;elves; but he had a hearty Good-Will to Mankind, tho&s;e of them e&s;pecially who wor|&s;hipped the true GOD in Sincerity; and was ever di&s;po&s;ed to all the Exerci&s;es of Kindne&s;s towards them. He was ten|der-hearted and compa&s;&s;ionate; apt to &s;hew Favour, ready to all the Offices of Humanity. In a Word, he was eminent for his benevolent Spirit and Conduct; one of tho&s;e good Men for whom one would even dare to die.</P>
<P>And he was a <HI>ju&s;t Man,</HI> (<HI>v.</HI> 22.) as well as charitable. What he gave away in Alms to the Poor was his <HI>own,</HI> not
<PB N="18" REF="005556_0016_1018674907A609D0">
the Property of his <HI>Creditors.</HI> He did not defraud one Man that he might exerci&s;e Charity towards another; much le&s;s did he think of atoning for his Inju&s;tice by being bountiful to the Nece&s;&s;itous. Neither did he heap up Riches, and not by right. He would not &s;teal, nor cheat; he would not de|ceive, nor over-reach; he would not impo&s;e on the Ignorance of his Brother, nor make an unrea&s;onable Advantage of his Nece&s;&s;ity; he would not be unfaithful to a Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him; he would not neglect the Payment of his Debts, nor <HI>violate</HI> his Promi&s;e; he would not keep back the Wages of the Poor, nor defer the Hire of the Labourer to his Damage. He was, in &s;hort, a downright hone&s;t Man. A Vein of Fairne&s;s and Equity run thro' all his Dealings with Mankind. He ever made that Law of <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> as well as of Chri&s;tianity, the Rule of his Conduct, <HI>All Things what&s;oever ye would that Men &s;hould do unto you, do ye even &s;o to them.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> adds, in this &s;ame 22d v. that he was a Man of <HI>good Report among all the Nation of the Jews;</HI> of a fair Cha|racter, highly e&s;teemed among his Neighbours, commonly reported to be a Man of an excellent Spirit. His Behaviour had been &s;o blamele&s;s and inoffen&s;ive, &s;o expre&s;&s;ive of Reve|rence towards GOD, and Benignity and Righteou&s;ne&s;s towards Men, that he had a <HI>good Name</HI> among the <HI>whole Nation of the Jews;</HI> they all &s;pake well of him. The true Fearers of GOD embraced him as a <HI>pious holy</HI> Man, and admired the divine Grace appearing in him. And, 'tis probable, tho&s;e who had no Religion them&s;elves &s;aw &s;o much of GOD in his devout, humble, charitable, and univer&s;ally exemplary Con|ver&s;ation, that they venerated his Per&s;on, and treated him with all decent Re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Let us now take Occa&s;ion, from this Part of CORNELIUS'S Character, to reflect upon our own. And may we not &s;ee our &s;elves reproved and condemned by his Example? May it not be &s;aid of too many of us, that, in&s;tead of <HI>giving much
<PB N="19" REF="005556_0017_101867500F576228">
Alms to the Poor,</HI> we have given &s;carce any at all? O how deaf have we been to their Cry! How often have we &s;hut up the Bowels of our Compa&s;&s;ion! How little have we done for their Relief under Difficulties and Nece&s;&s;ities! Have we not laid out <HI>that</HI> to pamper our Lu&s;ts, or adorn our Bodies, which might have better been be&s;towed to feed the Hungry, and cloath the Naked?&mdash;And are there none of us, who have added <HI>Inju&s;tice</HI> to Uncharitablene&s;s? Can we lay our Hands upon our Hearts, and &s;ay, that we have all along, in the Cour&s;e of Life, been fair and hone&s;t in our Dealings? Have we never oppre&s;&s;ed the Poor and Fatherle&s;s? Have we never wronged our Neighbour? Have we carefully kept our &s;elves from every Method of Fraud and Deceit, in our Trade and Traffick? Are there no Acts of Cozenage, no In&s;tances of Cheating and Over-reaching, that lie heavy upon our Con|&s;ciences? Let us review our pa&s;t Conduct. And wherein we may have failed of <HI>doing ju&s;tly,</HI> or <HI>loving Mercy.</HI> let us humble our &s;elves before GOD, and repent.</P>
<P>And let us learn, from the <HI>Example</HI> of CORNELIUS, both to <HI>give Alms</HI> and <HI>do Ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>With him, let us <HI>give much Alms to the Poor.</HI> This is a great Duty, much in&s;i&s;ted on in the <HI>Bible,</HI> and much is de|pendant on it. Inquiry will be made at the great and final Judgment, what Di&s;tributions we have made to the Poor? What Charities we have be&s;towed for the Relief of their Ne|ce&s;&s;ities? And according to what then appears, you will be <HI>ab&s;olved</HI> or <HI>condemned.</HI> If you have &s;hewed no Mercy, nei|ther will you then find Mercy; but that will be your Doom, <HI>Depart from me, ye Cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels. For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no Meat; I was thir&s;ty, and ye gave me no Drink; I was a Stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; &s;ick, and in Pri&s;on, and ye vi&s;ited me not.&mdash;Ina&s;much as ye did it not to one of the lea&s;t of the&s;e, ye did it not to me.</HI> Whereas, on the other Hand, if you have remembred the Poor, and
<PB N="20" REF="005556_0018_1018675328404688">
open'd your Hearts and Hands for their Help and Comfort, that will be the happy Sentence pronounced on you, <HI>Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you, from the Foundation of the World. For I was an hungred, and ye gave me Meat; I was thir&s;ty, and ye gave me Drink; I was a a Stranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye clothed me; I was &s;ick, and ye vi&s;ited me; I was in Pri&s;on, and ye came unto me.&mdash;Ina&s;much as ye have done it unto one of the lea&s;t of the&s;e my Bre|thren, ye have done it unto me.</HI></P>
<P>Do you believe, my <HI>Brethren,</HI> a coming Day of Judgment? Do you expect to &s;ee the <HI>Son of Man</HI> de&s;cending from Hea|ven in great Glory, with his holy Angels, to call the World to an Account? Do you hope to be found of your Judge, at that Day, in Peace? <HI>To do good and communicate, forget not: For with &s;uch Sacrifices God is well plea&s;ed.</HI> Be liberal in your Di&s;tributions to U&s;es of Charity. And be not weary of well-doing, neither faint in your Minds; but, as you have Oppor|tunity, do Good to all Men, e&s;pecially unto them who are of the Hou&s;hold of Faith: So will you be acquitted at the Bar of CHRIST, and received to the Rewards of Mercy in GOD's heavenly and eternal Kingdom.</P>
<P>And let me per&s;wade you to <HI>do Ju&s;tice</HI> as well as give Alms. This is equally a Matter of Nece&s;&s;ity, as you would hope, upon good Grounds, to give up your Account another Day, with Joy and not with Grief. Don't look upon the Prac|tice of <HI>Hone&s;ty,</HI> as little better than <HI>Pagan Morality,</HI> and be|low the Refinements of <HI>Chri&s;tianity.</HI> Deceive not your &s;elves. CHRIST is not a <HI>Mini&s;ter of Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s:</HI> And his Reli|gion is &s;o far from allowing its Profe&s;&s;ors to <HI>deal fal&s;ely,</HI> that it enjoins the contrary under the Penalty of Damnation. 'Tis true, the <HI>meer outward Part</HI> of Hone&s;ty, without an <HI>inward righteous Principle,</HI> is of no Value, <HI>religiou&s;ly</HI> &s;peaking: Neither ought our <HI>Hone&s;ty,</HI> or any other Virtue, to be plac'd in the
<PB N="21" REF="005556_0019_10186756B130D988">
Room of CHRIST, and depended on, in&s;tead of him, to pro|cure for us the Favour of GOD, and Admi&s;&s;ion into Heaven: But this don't at all weaken our Obligations to the Practice of Righteou&s;ne&s;s. The Law of <HI>Hone&s;ty</HI> is the Law of <HI>Chri&s;ti|anity;</HI> and if we think of being <HI>religious</HI> without being <HI>hone&s;t,</HI> we only put a <HI>Cheat</HI> upon our <HI>&s;elves.</HI> The righteous Lord loveth Righteou&s;ne&s;s; and they only who do Righteou&s;ne&s;s will be accepted of him: Neither will CHRIST &s;ave any but &s;uch. <Q>His Merits are no Refuge for <HI>religious Knaves;</HI> his Wounds no Sanctuary for <HI>&s;piritual Cheats, Extortioners</HI> and <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ors:</HI> And for &s;uch Per&s;ons to &s;helter them&s;elves in our SAVIOUR'S Propitiation, is to prophane and de&s;ecrate it.</Q> The plain Truth is, <HI>di&s;hone&s;t Dealing</HI> is a &s;hameful Thing in tho&s;e who call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians; and whatever their Pretences, or Hopes are, while they go on in the Practice of it, the LORD JESUS CHRIST will not own them for his Di&s;ciples at the great Day; but doom them to the Place of Weeping, and Wailing, and Gna&s;hing of Teeth.</P>
<P>III. But I mu&s;t now go on to the la&s;t Article in COR|NELIUS'S Character, <HI>his Faith in</HI> CHRIST, and <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> as <HI>his Di&s;ciple.</HI></P>
<P>We have hitherto con&s;idered him, not as a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> but an <HI>excellent good Man:</HI> For &s;o he really was, before he ever heard of CHRIST, as come in the Fle&s;h. 'Tis probable, in|deed, as he was a <HI>Jewi&s;h Pro&s;elyte,</HI> that he had heard of the <HI>Promi&s;e made to the Fathers,</HI> and believed it: But now that it was fulfilled, and CHRIST actually come, 'twas nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould <HI>believe</HI> in him as &s;uch. And in order to this, he was directed by an <HI>Angel,</HI> &s;ent on Purpo&s;e from GOD, to go to <HI>Peter,</HI> one of the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> of CHRIST: And it was from him, and under his Preaching, that he fir&s;t heard of CHRIST, and was enabled by Faith to embrace him as the SAVIOUR, not of the <HI>Jews</HI> only, but of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> al&s;o. The
<PB N="22" REF="005556_0020_10186758B6714950">
fir&s;t Sermon concerning CHRIST, CORNELIUS ever heard, we have recorded in this Chapter, from the 34th to the 43d v. And the <HI>Effect</HI> it had upon him, and tho&s;e that were with him, is recorded al&s;o in the following Ver&s;e, <HI>While</HI> Peter <HI>yet &s;pake the&s;e Words, the holy</HI> GHOST <HI>fell on all them which heard the Word.</HI> And that the <HI>holy</HI> GHOST &s;o fell on them, <HI>i. e. Cornelius</HI> and <HI>Company,</HI> as to di&s;po&s;e and enable them to re|ceive CHRIST by true <HI>Faith,</HI> we learn from the 15th Cha|pter of the <HI>Acts;</HI> where the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> giving the other <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> an Account of the <HI>Effect</HI> of this very Sermon upon CORNELIUS and the other <HI>Gentiles</HI> with him, &s;ays, v. 8, 9. <HI>God gave them the holy</HI> GHOST, <HI>purifying their Hearts by Faith.</HI></P>
<P>So that CORNELIUS was a <HI>Believer</HI> in CHRIST: And, as &s;uch, he took upon him the Badge of Di&s;ciple&s;hip; was <HI>bap|tized in the Name of the Lord,</HI> as we read in the la&s;t <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> of the <HI>Chapter.</HI></P>
<P>How he behaved him&s;elf in his <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> Capacity, we are not particularly told; but he, no doubt, continued &s;tedfa&s;tly in the Doctrine of CHRIST, and made Improvements in Grace and Holine&s;s, in Proportion to the greater Advantages he was now favoured with. We may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, if he was a <HI>good Man,</HI> while only a <HI>Jewi&s;h Pro&s;elyte,</HI> he was <HI>much more &s;o</HI> now that he was a <HI>Believer in</HI> JESUS; having &s;een and heard tho&s;e Things, which many Prophets and Kings have de&s;ired to &s;ee and hear, but could not.</P>
<P>And if <HI>Faith</HI> in CHRIST was a matter of Nece&s;&s;ity in Re&s;pect of CORNELIUS, 'tis certainly &s;o in Re&s;pect of us, who live where his Go&s;pel is preached, and the Evidences of it, as a Revelation from GOD, have been clearly &s;et before us. We are the Per&s;ons to whom our SAVIOUR &s;peaks, as it were, by Name, in tho&s;e Words, Mark 16. 16. <HI>He that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved: But he that believeth not &s;hall be damned.</HI> And again, John 3. 18. <HI>He that believeth on him is not condemned; but he
<PB N="23" REF="005556_0021_1018675E1C096DE0">
that believeth not is condemned already, becau&s;e he hath not belie|ved in the Name of the only begotten Son of God.</HI> And yet a|gain, v. 36. <HI>He that believeth on the Son hath everla&s;ting Life: And he that believeth not the Son, &s;hall not &s;ee Life; but the Wrath of God abideth on him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Take Heed then,</HI> my Brethren, <HI>le&s;t there be in any of you an evil Heart of Unbelief in departing from the living God,</HI> and his <HI>only begotten Son</HI> JESUS CHRIST.&mdash;Don't &s;atisfy your &s;elves with any Religion without CHRIST, nor with any Thing in Religion to the Exclu&s;ion of him. Deceive not your &s;elves: <HI>There is not Salvation in any other; for there is none other Name under Heaven given among Men, whereby you can be &s;aved.&mdash;Re|ceive it as a faithful Saying,</HI> and account it <HI>worthy of all Accep|tion, that</HI> CHRIST JESUS <HI>came into the World to &s;ave Sinners.</HI> And <HI>count all Things but Dung, that you may win</HI> CHRIST, <HI>and be found in him, not having your own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is of the Law; but that which is thro' the Faith of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of</HI> GOD <HI>by Faith:</HI> Yet, &s;ee to it that your <HI>Faith</HI> has a due Influence both on your <HI>Hearts</HI> and <HI>Lives;</HI> that it be an inward, active, powerful Principle of holy Obe|dience; &s;hewing it &s;elf in all the genuine Exerci&s;es of Love to GOD, and the REDEEMER, and your <HI>Neighbour:</HI> So may you look for the Mercy of the LORD JESUS CHRIST to eternal Life.</P>
<P>I have now done with my Text. But it remains, as I promi&s;ed at fir&s;t, to give you &s;ome Account of that excellent Servant of GOD, who&s;e Death gave Occa&s;ion to the preceed|ing Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>And I am inclin'd to this, not that I might flatter a dead Friend, but do Honour to that <HI>Grace of God, which was ex|ceeding abundant towards him, in Faith and Love that is in</HI> CHRIST JESUS. Such con&s;picuous In&s;tances of high Attain|ments
<PB N="24" REF="005556_0022_101867634B9FB540">
in the chri&s;tian Life are very uncommon. And GOD expects a ju&s;t Notice &s;hould be taken of them. It would be a Wrong to the World, Inju&s;tice to the Memory of the Dead, and a with-holding from GOD the Glory due to his rich Grace in JESUS CHRIST, to be &s;ilent, when &s;o fair an Occa&s;ion is offered publickly to recommend Religion. And I am the ra|ther di&s;po&s;ed to this Service, as, in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, I &s;hall be under no Temptation to exceed the Truth, and none will &s;u&s;pect I am govern'd by &s;ini&s;ter Views.</P>
<P>The Per&s;on who&s;e Death we are lamenting, &s;eems &s;o like to the <HI>Scripture</HI> CORNELIUS, that, I doubt not, your Thoughts were upon him, while I was opening the Character in the Text: Nor was he at all inferiour to him, either as a <HI>devout Man; fearing God with all Hou&s;e, and praying to God always:</HI> Or as a <HI>charitable Man; giving much Alms,</HI> con&s;idering his E|&s;tate, <HI>to the Poor:</HI> Or as a <HI>ju&s;t Man, and of good Report among all the People</HI> by whom he was known: Or as a &s;ound <HI>Belie|ver in</HI> JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not confine my &s;elf to the Method of my Text in giving his Character; but chu&s;e to &s;peak of the Things that were exemplary in him, as they may come to Mind: And I &s;hall &s;ay nothing but what I came to the Knowledge of, ei|ther by <HI>per&s;onal</HI> Acquaintance and Conver&s;ation with him, or have &s;een under his own Hand in Papers that he has left be|hind him.</P>
<P>It was when between <HI>fifteen</HI> and <HI>&s;ixteen</HI> Years of Age, that he had awakened in him a &s;erious Concern about his Soul, and everla&s;ting Salvation. His Sins were now &s;et in Order before him, and his Soul filled with Di&s;tre&s;s, from the View he had of him&s;elf as expo&s;ed to the Cur&s;e of the Law, and the Wrath of GOD. And he made a good U&s;e of his Convictions;
<PB N="25" REF="005556_0023_10186764F907A3D0">

I find him writing upon this Head in the following Words. <Q>Never did any Per&s;on more earne&s;tly &s;eek for Food for their Bodies to nouri&s;h and &s;trengthen them, than I did for Opportunies to pour out my Soul before GOD, in humble and importunate Prayer for Grace and Mercy. This was my con&s;tant and daily Work, not only on fre|quent and fixed Sea&s;ons for &s;olemn Prayer; but by con|&s;tant keeping my Heart with GOD, and by earne&s;t <HI>ejacu|latory</HI> Prayer, pouring out my humble and fervent Petitions to the GOD of all Grace, that he would be plea&s;ed, in his infinite Mercy, to have Compa&s;&s;ion on my mi&s;erable Soul, and not &s;uffer me to peri&s;h under his Wrath forever.</Q> And he was particular in his Care, not to &s;tifle his Convictions, but lay him&s;elf &s;till more open to them, that he might know the Wor&s;t of him&s;elf, and the All-&s;ufficiency of CHRIST, and be enabled to repair to him as the <HI>alone</HI> SAVIOUR, in the <HI>Go&s;pel-Way.</HI> <Q>I humbly ble&s;s GOD, &s;ays he, that he did not &s;uffer me to take any Methods, or u&s;e any Means, to &s;tifle the Convictions of the ble&s;&s;ed SPIRIT, and &s;o recover my carnal Ea&s;e and Re&s;t; but that I was influenced to do all that lay in my Power to cheri&s;h the&s;e Convictions, and to lay my Soul open yet further to them, by earne&s;tly begging of GOD, that he would be plea&s;ed to make me yet more and more &s;en&s;ible of my dreadful E&s;tate, and &s;hew me the Wor&s;t of my &s;elf, and the ab&s;olute Need I &s;tood in of the LORD JESUS CHRIST; and that he would di&s;|cover him to my Soul, as a mo&s;t &s;utable and all-&s;ufficient SAVIOUR for &s;uch a mi&s;erable undone Sinner as I am, and per&s;wade and enable me to receive him by a true and living

<P>He was but a very young Man, when he came into <HI>Fellow|&s;hip with this Church;</HI> and he did it, after great Exerci&s;e of Mind, and upon full Conviction of his Duty in this Regard.

<P>And he was particularly concern'd about his <HI>inward</HI> Prin|ciples and Springs of Action; not &s;atisfying him&s;elf with the <HI>external</HI> Performance of Duty, but reali&s;ing the Nece&s;&s;ity of right Aims and Views, and that the Heart be right with GOD.

Now it is with a View to GOD: And the plea&s;ing and glorifying him, I can &s;incerely &s;ay, is the great End I aim at, in all the Duties I perform.

And he was careful, not only that his Aims and Principles might be good, but that he might al&s;o place his <HI>Dependance right;</HI> not on <HI>his own Works of Righteoune&s;s,</HI> but the <HI>Merits of the</HI> LORD JESUS CHRIST.

<P>But there are &s;ome ob&s;ervable Things in the Life of this good Man, which mu&s;t not be pa&s;&s;ed over without &s;pecial Notice.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is, The Chri&s;tian Temper of Mind, and noble Re&s;olutions, with which he went out into the World when he came of Age. I &s;hall give you what I have to &s;ay here in his own Words. Says he, <Q>When I arrived at Age, and came into the World to act for my &s;elf, I ble&s;s GOD that by his

Grace, I can &s;ay, I came into it with this Di&s;po&s;ition and Re&s;olution, to make the Glory of GOD, and in Conjunction therewith, and Subordination thereto, the Salvation of my precious Soul, my great and principal Care; that I would, by the Help of Grace, make this World, and all the Af|fairs and Concerns of it, &s;toop and be &s;ubordinated thereto; that by a prudent Management of my <HI>particular</HI> Calling, I would make it &s;ub&s;ervient to my <HI>general</HI> Calling; and that I would endeavour to follow the Advice of my ble&s;&s;ed SA|viour, <HI>Seek fir&s;t the Kingdom of God and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and to rely on his Promi&s;e for the <HI>Addition of other Things,</HI> as he &s;hould &s;ee them to be <HI>needful</HI> for me. Accordingly, I was bro't to conclude with my &s;elf, that to be rich or great in this World was not nece&s;&s;ary for me, but to be religious and holy was <HI>nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> ab&s;olutely &s;o; and &s;o I was brought to this Re&s;olution, to hearken to, and comply with, that Admonition of GOD, by his holy Prophet, <HI>Seek|e&s;t thou great Things for thy &s;elf? Seek them not.</HI> And to this it was owing, that I never involved my &s;elf in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this World, &s;o as to make it become a Snare to my Soul; nor &s;uffer'd any worldly Affairs to hinder me from waiting on GOD, either in the <HI>public,</HI> or <HI>private,</HI> or <HI>&s;ecret</HI> Duties of Religion.</Q> How happy would it be, if our young Peo|ple would generally &s;et out in the World, under the Influence of &s;uch holy Di&s;po&s;itions and Re&s;olutions! Making Religion their <HI>principal</HI> Bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;ubordinating their temporal Affairs to the Concerns of their Souls and eternal Salvation.</P>
<P>Another Thing I can't but e&s;teem exemplary in him, was the con&s;iderate religious Temper, with which he engaged in the weighty Affair of <HI>Matrimony.</HI> He writes thus upon it; <Q>When I came to a Re&s;olution to alter my Condition, by entring into the married State, this I con&s;idered as a Matter of great Weight, and that it would be my making or un|doing in the World. And it put me upon mo&s;t humble

and importunate Supplications to GOD, my heavenly Fa|ther, for Guidance and Direction.</Q> And he &s;peaks with Thankfulne&s;s, of being directed to one, <Q>with whom he lived happily; and that they lived together as Heirs of the Grace of Life.</Q> It would be well, if our young Men and Women would bear in Mind this good Example, and act ac|cording to it. This of Marriage is one of the mo&s;t momen|tous Affairs of Life; and yet, tis too commonly engaged in with no more Con&s;ideration, than if it was a very trivial Con|cern.&mdash;It ought to be tho't upon in a &s;erious Manner, and carried to GOD, by frequent and earne&s;t Prayer, as a Matter of the greate&s;t Importance; that which has a near Connection, not only with our <HI>temporal</HI> Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery, but the Hap|pine&s;s or Mi&s;ery of our <HI>Souls</HI> in <HI>another World.</HI> If, in any Thing of a <HI>temporal</HI> Nature, you need the divine Guidance, 'tis in <HI>this:</HI> And you &s;hould religiou&s;ly acknowledge GOD, that he may direct your Steps. Tho&s;e Matches, in which GOD is not con&s;ulted, are mo&s;t likely to prove Cur&s;es.</P>
<P>Another Thing worthy of Remark in this good Man, is that <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Hone&s;ty</HI> he ever made Con&s;cience of exerci&s;ing, in the Cour&s;e of his Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s. He writes upon this Head in the&s;e Words; <Q>I am able, with Comfort, to look back upon the Whole of my Concerns in the World, and can &s;incerely &s;ay, I am not in the lea&s;t con&s;cious to my &s;elf of any Fraud, or of deceiving any Man, in the Cour&s;e of my Dealing with him. And, as for any Promi&s;es or En|gagements that I might, at any Time, bring my &s;elf under, it has been my con&s;ciencious Care, at all Times, to fulfill them, in the exacte&s;t Time, and to the Satisfaction of every Per&s;on to whom I &s;tood engaged; always believing and reali&s;ing, that a Man cannot be a <HI>good Chri&s;tian</HI> without be|ing a <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>hone&s;t</HI> Man.</Q> And he herein certainly judged right. In vain may any pretend to be the <HI>Di&s;ciples</HI> of CHRIST, if they break their Promi&s;es, neglect the Payment
<PB N="31" REF="005556_0029_10186779A9F43FE8">
of their ju&s;t Debts, and u&s;e the Methods of Fraud and Deceit in their Trade and Commerce. This de&s;erves our &s;erious Con&s;ideration in this Day of prevailing <HI>Di&s;hone&s;ty.</HI> For tho' it is not eno', that we <HI>deal ju&s;tly;</HI> yet this mu&s;t be one Ingre|dient in our Character, or we &s;hall never inherit the Kingdom of GOD.</P>
<P><HI>Family-Religion</HI> al&s;o is <HI>that</HI> in which he is worthy of Imitati|on. Says he, <Q><HI>Jo&s;hua'</HI>s Re&s;olution has been mine, <HI>As for me and my Hou&s;e, we will &s;erve the Lord.</HI> And it has been my con&s;tant and unfeigned De&s;ire and Endeavour to walk in my Hou&s;e, with a perfect Heart; and to &s;et the LORD always as pre&s;ent before me. And when it plea&s;ed GOD to increa&s;e my Family, by giving me Children, it was al|ways the great Concern of my Soul to be faithful to GOD and <HI>them,</HI> by in&s;tructing them, and bringing them up for GOD; and by &s;etting an holy Example before them.</Q> He has left, in Writing, a large Form of In&s;truction, by Way of Que&s;tion and An&s;wer, of his own drawing up: And as it was the Form he ordinarily u&s;ed in In&s;tructing his Children, he com|mitted it to Writing for their Benefit, not knowing but it might plea&s;e GOD to take him away, while &s;ome of them were young: And 'tis done with good Judgment, and di&s;co|vers con&s;iderable of Knowledge in Religion. His Children, 'tis to be hoped, will <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, and make a wi&s;e and and good U&s;e of it.</P>
<P>He was likewi&s;e <HI>eminently</HI> a <HI>Man of Prayer.</HI> Few, I be|lieve, were ever more con&s;tant in an Attendance on this Duty, or made it more their Bu&s;ine&s;s. I have heard him &s;ay, <Q>that Prayer to GOD had been his <HI>daily</HI> Employment, the Work and Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Life, from the Days of his Youth.</Q> And in his Papers I find him &s;aying, <Q>That, for the Space of <HI>Forty Years,</HI> hardly ever twenty-four Hours had rolled o|ver his Head, but, at lea&s;t, <HI>two Hours</HI> of it had been &s;pent
<PB N="32" REF="005556_0030_1018677D49AA6550">
in &s;erious &s;ervent Prayer to GOD, in <HI>Secret,</HI> in his <HI>Clo&s;et,</HI> and in his <HI>Family.</HI></Q> And he did not attend this Duty, as <HI>forced</HI> to it by his Con&s;cience, or as e&s;teeming it a Ta&s;k; but it was a real Plea&s;ure to him, in this Way, to repair to his heavenly FATHER. I have heard him &s;ay, <Q>Prayer was the Delight of his Soul:</Q> Nor otherwi&s;e could he have been &s;o abundant in it.</P>
<P>In fine, His <HI>Charity</HI> is what de&s;erves an honourable Men|tion. <Q>I humbly thank GOD, &s;ays he, that, by his Ble&s;&s;ing on my poor Endeavours, and &s;mall Bu&s;ine&s;s in the World, I have been enabled, not only to provide for my Family, and to live comfortably, but al&s;o to exerci&s;e my &s;elf in <HI>Works of Charity,</HI> as my Ability and Opportunity have re|quired; and that, I hope, from a &s;incere Love to GOD and CHRIST, and out of Obedience to his ble&s;&s;ed Will, and that I might honour the Lord with my Sub&s;tance, and te&s;ti|fy my Gratitude to him for his great Goodne&s;s to me.</Q></P>
<P>I would add here, I have had Occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve in him, &s;ince his Introduction into the <HI>Deacon'</HI>s Office, a peculiar Con|cern for the Poor: And he always appeared to me, not only faithful and prudent in di&s;tributing the Charities put into his Hands for their U&s;e, but con&s;ciencious in doing the utmo&s;t him&s;elf to relieve them under their Nece&s;&s;ities. And he took Plea&s;ure in mini&s;tring to their Help; and was ready, upon proper Occa&s;ions, to provoke his Friends and Neighbours to Love and good Works. In the&s;e, as well as in all other Re|&s;pects, he <HI>u&s;ed the Office of a Deacon well,</HI> and <HI>purcha&s;ed to him|&s;elf a good Degree, and great Boldne&s;s in the Faith, which is in</HI> CHRIST JESUS.</P>
<P>I have now acquainted you, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, with the <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Life</HI> of this good Man; his Love to CHRIST, and uniform, regular, humble and clo&s;e Walk, with him. And

what might be expected as the Fruit, but a good Hope to|wards GOD; yea, a comfortable A&s;&s;urance of his being inte|re&s;ted in his Favour here, and of dwelling with him in Heaven hereafter? And this accordingly was the Effect.

to eternal Life: And I the rather take this Opportunity to re|late it to you, becau&s;e it di&s;covers &s;o clear and &s;ound a Judg|ment in the true <HI>Scripture</HI> Way of arriving at <HI>A&s;&s;urance.</HI> It is this; <Q><HI>Sanctification</HI> is certainly the be&s;t and mo&s;t certain <HI>Evidence</HI> of our being <HI>pardoned</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tified,</HI> let Men boa&s;t and brag of their &s;trong Faith in the Merits and Righteou&s;|ne&s;s of CHRIST, and that they are ju&s;tified thereby, while they have no Regard to <HI>inherent Grace</HI> and <HI>Holine&s;s,</HI> as the <HI>Evidence</HI> hereof.

In order to be &s;atisfied in this great Go&s;pel Priviledge, that the ble&s;&s;ed GOD has <HI>pardoned</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tified</HI> me, by imputing the per|fect Righteou&s;ne&s;s of his SON, the Lord JESUS CHRIST, to my Soul; would I a&s;cend up to Heaven, to &s;earch into GOD'S &s;ecret Coun&s;els? No, I would rather de&s;cend into my own Heart, and make this &s;erious and &s;olemn Inquiry, whether the holy SPIRIT of GOD has come and taken Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of me, and &s;et up his Kingdom of Grace in me, &s;ubdued my Lu&s;ts, and de&s;troyed the Dominion of Sin and Satan in me, and enabled me heartily to embrace the Lord JESUS CHRIST, &s;ubmitting my Soul and Con&s;cience to his Rule and Government? What better <HI>Evidence</HI> can I have, that I am a Child of GOD, than to find that he has wro't the Temper of a Child in me? How can I know that GOD loves me, but by finding the Love of GOD rooted in my Heart?

<P>Thus you &s;ee, how this good Man came by his <HI>Hope</HI> of Heaven. And it was always (from the Time of my Acquain|tance

with him) the &s;ame &s;teady firm Per&s;ua&s;ion, without wa|vering or Interruption: And &s;o it continued, thro' the whole of his lingering Sickne&s;s. I never perceived in him the lea&s;t Unea&s;ine&s;s, thro' Fear of Death; but often had Occa&s;ion to take Notice of his calm and placid State of Mind, his Willing|ne&s;s to die, and &s;trong Faith that he &s;hould <HI>die in</HI> CHRIST, and go to be with CHRIST, in his heavenly FATHER'S King|dom. So far as fell within my Ob&s;ervation, he was a Stranger, both in <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Sickne&s;s,</HI> to a <HI>rapturous Kind of Joy;</HI> but he was favoured with that, which, in my Opinion, was much more de&s;ireable, a manly, &s;olid, &s;table Satisfaction of Soul, ever accompanied with a becoming Seriou&s;ne&s;s and Solemnity of Spirit. The greate&s;t Emotion I ever &s;aw in him was a few Days before our la&s;t <HI>Sacrament,</HI> when, looking upon me with a plea&s;ant, yet &s;erious Countenance, he &s;aid with &s;ome Degree of Warmth, <Q>I &s;hould e&s;teem it a great Favour, if GOD would plea&s;e to call me hence before the next <HI>Sabbath,</HI> that, while you, and the Church I belong to, are celebrating the <HI>Memorial of my dying</HI> SAVIOUR, <HI>at his Supper</HI> on Earth, I may be &s;itting down at the <HI>Supper of the Lamb in</HI> GOD'<HI>s heavenly Kingdom:</HI> Neverthele&s;s, not as I will, FATHER, but as thou wilt.</Q> He would often &s;ay, <Q>I ble&s;s GOD, I can with Appropriation call GOD MY FATHER, and JESUS CHRIST MY SAVIOUR.</Q> He would often &s;ay, <Q><HI>I know whom I have believed, and I am per&s;waded, that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him again&s;t that Day.</HI></Q> He would often &s;ay, <Q>I know GOD has wro't <HI>his own Work</HI> in my Soul; and <HI>I am confident of this very Thing, that he which hath begun a good Work in me, will per|form it unto the Day of</HI> CHRIST.</Q> He would &s;ometimes &s;ay, <Q>GOD is with me, and he will be with me; he has prepared me for him&s;elf, and he will take me to him&s;elf</Q> I have heard him &s;ay, <Q>He had not the lea&s;t Doubt of his going to Heaven when he died; <HI>For</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>God has made me meet for the heavenly Inheritance.</HI></Q></P>

I would not &s;ugge&s;t by all this, as tho' he was free from Infirmities and Faults. In this Sen&s;e, <HI>there is none that doth Good, no, not one.</HI> And he would often, in the Mid&s;t of his &s;tronge&s;t Expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>A&s;&s;urance,</HI> &s;peak of him&s;elf as a poor, frail, imperfect, &s;inful Man; and &s;ay, after all, '<HI>that</HI> I e&s;teem the fitte&s;t Prayer for me, GOD <HI>be merciful to me a Sin|ner:</HI> But then, he once added what I can't but think worth mentioning, <Q>So long, &s;ays he, as I know that my Heart is right with GOD, and that he has form'd <HI>his own ble&s;&s;ed Image</HI> in me, the <HI>Remains of Sin</HI> don't at all weaken my <HI>Hope.</HI> I de&s;ire, indeed, to be humble under a Sen&s;e hereof, and to mourn for my Infirmities and Sins; but they &s;hall not make me part with my <HI>Hope.</HI> It was not the De&s;ign of CHRIST to make Believers <HI>perfect</HI> in this World. Perfect Freedom from Sin, and Perfection in Holine&s;s, are re&s;erved for Heaven: And I hope to enjoy the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings there.</Q></P>
<P>In a Word, thro' his whole Confinement, 'twas more than a Recompence for a Vi&s;it to him, to behold the Serenity of his Soul, the Strength of his Faith in GOD and CHRIST, his intire Contempt of the World, perfect Indifference to Life, and con&s;tant actual Willingne&s;s and Readine&s;s for Death. This indeed was very much his <HI>habitual</HI> Frame for a Cour&s;e of Years before his Sickne&s;s: And it continued, yea, increa|&s;ed, in that <HI>trying</HI> Time. He was, all along, in his Sickne&s;s, in the <HI>lively</HI> Exerci&s;e of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Hope;</HI> and often expre&s;&s;ed, even his Longings to be with CHRIST, which is be&s;t of all. The la&s;t Time I &s;aw him was about three Hours before his Death; and he enjoy'd the &s;ame calm State of Mind, and expre&s;s'd the &s;ame <HI>A&s;&s;urance of Hope,</HI> he had all along done. The only Difference was, his Strength &s;o far failed, and Tongue faulter'd, that it was with Difficulty I was able to under&s;tand what he &s;aid: Tho' I di&s;tinctly remember, the la&s;t Words I heard him utter were the&s;e, <HI>When you come to Heaven, you will find me there.</HI></P>

Under the&s;e Circum&s;tances, by Faith looking beyond the Grave to the Joys of his LORD, his <HI>Body fell a&s;leep,</HI> while his <HI>Spirit,</HI> I have no Doubt, was receiv'd <HI>to the Spirits of ju&s;t Men made perfect:</HI> And when the <HI>Son of Man</HI> &s;hall come, in the Clouds of Heaven, at the great and la&s;t Day, to <HI>awake tho&s;e who &s;leep in the Du&s;t,</HI> He, among the <HI>Dead in</HI> CHRIST, &s;hall ri&s;e: And it will be to <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Immortality</HI> in GOD'S heavenly and everla&s;ting Kingdom.</P>
<P>And can the &s;urviving <HI>Relatives</HI> of &s;uch a Servant of JESUS CHRIST be di&s;con&s;olate?

<P>We unitedly bow the Knee to the GOD and FATHER of our LORD JESUS CHRIST; be&s;eeching him to be the <HI>Wi|dow'</HI>s GOD and <HI>Hu&s;band.</HI> And may &s;he be quickened in her Preparations to follow after her departed <HI>Companion,</HI> that &s;he may again &s;ee his Face, and live with him in Glory.</P>
<P>Nor can we wi&s;h any Thing better for the bereaved <HI>Chil|dren,</HI> than that their <HI>Father'</HI>s GOD would be their GOD, and give them a double Portion of that good Spirit which re&s;ted on him.

They will ri&s;e up in Judg|ment again&s;t you, if you don't.&mdash;Let it be your &s;ollicitous Endeavour to &s;upply his Place in the World, and be a like Ble&s;&s;ing in it.</P>

And let us all duly re&s;ent the Death of this <HI>Man of</HI> GOD.
