<BIBL>1 TIM. II. 4.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Who will have all Men to be &s;aved, and to come unto the Knowledge of the Truth.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE holy Apo&s;tle begins this Chapter with ear|ne&s;t Exhortations re&s;pecting the great Duty of Prayer, an e&s;&s;ential Part of Religion, and which every Man who knows him&s;elf, and &s;ees his Dependance upon God, will be in the daily Exerci&s;e of, for him&s;elf. But here the Apo&s;tle lets his Son <HI>Timothy</HI> know, that Prayers, and e&s;pecially publick Prayers, (in which he and other Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t were to lead, and be the Mouth of the People unto God) may not be confined unto their own &s;elves; but their devout Wi&s;hes, and thank|ful Acknowledgements, &s;hould extend even to all Mankind in general; and to tho&s;e of di&s;tingui&s;hed Character for Power and Authority, in a particular Manner. <HI>I exhort therefore that fir&s;t of all Supplications, Prayers, Interce&s;&s;ions, and giving of Thanks, be made for all Men: for Kings, and all that are in Authority.</HI> v. 1, 2. And he &s;ugge&s;ts a twofold Rea&s;on herefor. The fir&s;t taken from them&s;elves: that it would be for their own Good; even for the Peace, Order &amp; Welfare of Society. He and others &s;hould pray for Kings, and all in Authority, that they might rule &s;o in the fear of God, and with &s;uch Wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice and Clemency, as that the People might love and honour them; and under their wi&s;e and ju&s;t
<PB N="2" REF="006955_0004_102AC4589B3A2760">
Admini&s;tration, <HI>lead a quiet and peaceable Life, in all Godline&s;s and Hone&s;ty,</HI> v. 2.&mdash;The other Argument is taken from its being good, and right, and proper in it &s;elf, and plea&s;ing to God: <HI>For this is good and acceptable in the Sight of God our Saviour,</HI> v. 3.</P>
<P>And this Argument is further illu&s;trated and confirmed by the following Words, which I have cho&s;en for my Text: <HI>Who will have all Men to be &s;aved, and to come to the Know|ledge of the Truth.</HI> As much as to &s;ay, You may depend up|on it, that Prayers and Interce&s;&s;ions for all Men, are good and acceptable in the Sight of God our Saviour: For he would have all Men to be &s;aved: And if he would have all Men to be &s;aved; it mu&s;t needs be good and acceptable to him, that we &s;hould earne&s;tly pray for them: And it affords abundant Encouragement to be much in Prayer for them. Surely, &s;ince God is willing that they &s;hould all be &s;aved; we ought to expre&s;s our good Will &amp; Wi&s;hes in our Prayers for them, that they might be &s;aved. Since God will have all Men to be &s;aved; let it be our Hearts De&s;ire and Prayer to God, not only for I&s;rael, that they may be &s;aved; but that God's &s;aving Health might be made known to all Nations; and that all Fle&s;h might &s;ee the Salvation of God.</P>
<P>But what I propo&s;e on this Occa&s;ion, is to con&s;ider my Text by it&s;elf, as &s;etting forth the <HI>univer&s;al Benevolence,</HI> and <HI>good Will,</HI> that God bears to Mankind; which is expre&s;s'd in two Things, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>

<ITEM>2. In willing them the Means by which they may be &s;aved, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> The Knowledge of the Truth: <HI>Who will have all Men to be &s;aved, and to come unto the Knowledge of the Truth.</HI></ITEM>

<P>Accordingly the two Points which our Text pre&s;ents to our Meditation at this Time, are the&s;e, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>

<ITEM>I. <HI>That God may be &s;aid in &s;ome Sen&s;e to will the Salvation of all Men.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>As the Way and Means of their Salvation, be wills that they &s;hould come to the Knowledge of the Truth.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>To each of the&s;e I &s;hall &s;peak with all convenient Brevity; and then make &s;uch an Application as may lead you to &s;ee the Pertinency of the Subject to the &s;olemn Occa&s;ion now before us.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="006955_0005_102AC45A431D0328">
I. <HI>The great God may be &s;aid in &s;ome Sen&s;e to will the Sal|vation of all Men.</HI></P>
<P>So &s;ays my Text, <HI>Who will have all Men to be &s;aved.</HI>&mdash;The Word <GAP DESC="foreign">, here u&s;ed for <HI>Will,</HI> is that which is com|monly u&s;ed in the new Te&s;tament for willing any Thing, or for expre&s;&s;ing the Will of God. Sometimes it &s;ignifies an <HI>efficacious Willing,</HI> whereby God does certainly effect the Thing that he <HI>wills;</HI> as when Chri&s;t &s;aid, Matth. 8. 9. <HI>I WILL, be thou clean; and immediately his Lepro&s;y was clean&s;ed.</HI> So Joh. 5. 21. <HI>The Son quickneth whom He WILL.</HI>&mdash;Some|times it &s;ignifies a <HI>willing,</HI> wi&s;hing, or de&s;iring in God, that is not always <HI>efficacious.</HI> As <HI>Matth.</HI> 23. 37. <HI>How often WOULD I have gathered thy Children together &amp;c. and ye WOULD NOT.</HI></P>
<P>And now the Que&s;tion that naturally occurs here, is, <HI>How and in what Sen&s;e it may be &s;aid, that God WILLS the Salva|tion of all Men; or WILL have all Men to be &s;aved?</HI></P>
<P>To which I would an&s;wer and &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. It cannot be allowed to be with a <HI>decretive</HI> and <HI>efficaci|ous Will.</HI></P>
<P>Not with an ab&s;olute Purpo&s;e, and fixed Determination of his Will: For if &s;o, then all Men would be &s;aved; and yet by ob&s;erving the general Tenor of many Mens Lives, and comparing the &s;ame with the Tenor of the Go&s;pel Covenant, the contrary is &s;adly evident. If by the Will of God, in my Text, the divine <HI>Decree</HI> or <HI>Purpo&s;e</HI> or <HI>fixed Re&s;olution</HI> of his Will was intended; then all Men would certainly and infallibly be &s;aved: For all the Purpo&s;es of the divine Will &s;hall come to pa&s;s. <HI>The Coun&s;el of the Lord that &s;hall &s;tand, and the Thoughts of his Heart to all Generations,</HI> P&s;al. 33. 4. So Prov. 19. 21. <HI>There are many Devices in a Man's Heart, neverthele&s;s the Coun&s;el of the Lord that &s;hall &s;tand.</HI> And there is nothing can defeat or di&s;appoint God in any of his Purpo|&s;es: For as the &s;ame in&s;pired Preacher tells us, Prov. 21. 30. <HI>There is no Wi&s;dom nor Under&s;tanding nor Coun&s;el against the Lord.</HI> For <HI>the Lord of Ho&s;ts hath &s;worn, &s;aying, Surely as I have thought, &s;o &s;hall it come to pa&s;s; and as I have purpo&s;ed, it &s;hall &s;tand.</HI> I&s;ai 14. 24. And therefore, in&s;tead of its be|ing the ab&s;olute Purpo&s;e and Decree of God that all Men &s;hould be &s;aved; it mu&s;t be &s;aid, that in the Up&s;hot of
<PB N="4" REF="006955_0006_102AC45BD7960660">
Things with Re&s;pect to the whole World of Mankind, and when in&s;tead of their being all &s;aved, the Wicked are all &s;ent away into everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment, and only the Righteous enter into Life eternal; this is all according to the Purpo&s;e and Will of God; even according to the determinate Coun|&s;el and Fore-knowledge of God; as the Scripture expre&s;&s;es it concerning Chri&s;t being delivered to Death, <HI>Acts</HI> 2. 23.</P>
<P>But now, notwith&s;tanding all this, there is a Sen&s;e in which God is willing that all Men &s;hould be &s;aved. But this leads us into an Aby&s;s: a My&s;tery that is unfathomable by us.&mdash;The natural Notions we have of the divine Being, as well as Scripture Revelation, teach us, that <HI>known unto God are all his Works from the Beginning of the World,</HI> Act. 15. 18. And that &s;uch an infinitely wi&s;e Being mu&s;t needs have a Plan of Operation drawn in his own infinite Mind, from the Days of Eternity. And none can or dare &s;ay, that the Scheme drawn in the infinite Mind of God, &s;hall be broken in upon; but that all will come to pa&s;s according to the divine Determinations.&mdash;However, the natural Notions we have of the divine Goodne&s;s, and other Perfections; toge|ther with what we find in Scripture, plainly teach us, that God in &s;ome Sen&s;e or other wills the Salvation of all Men.</P>
<P>But now to form adequate Conceptions of the eternal Pur|po&s;es of God; and of that Willingne&s;s he has for the Sal|vation of all Men; &s;o as to reconcile them in our own Minds, is quite beyond the limited &amp; feeble Faculties of Man. And therefore it rather becomes us with humble Reverence to re|ceive them both as Truths concerning God, than to deny either, or too curiou&s;ly to pry into them: For it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that this is a Ca&s;e in which <HI>we know not how to order our Speech by Rea&s;on of Darkne&s;s.</HI> We are told, Deut. 29. 19. <HI>That &s;ecret Things belong to God.</HI> And &s;urely there is nothing more &s;ecret to us than the <HI>divine Decrees,</HI> which he keeps within his own Brea&s;t. It is utterly a Secret to us, not only what God has purpo&s;ed, and decreed, before it be revealed in his Word, or come to pa&s;s in his Providence: But we cannot &s;o much as conceive what the&s;e Purpo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> or how they lie or operate in the divine Mind; or what In|fluence they have upon natural Cau&s;es, or upon moral Agents, or how far they take away their free Agency, or nece&s;&s;itate Things as to their final Event.&mdash;But as we are told in the Ver&s;e
<PB N="5" REF="006955_0007_102AC45E41B13E28">
before quoted, <HI>That Things revealed belong to us and to our Children;</HI> &s;o then it is the <HI>revealed Will of God,</HI> that we have to do with, and that belongs to us to con&s;ider. Accordingly I proceed to an&s;wer po&s;itively,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>God may be &s;aid to will the Salvation of all Men, as he in his Word manife&s;ts &s;uch a Willingne&s;s, and gives us many ample Tokens thereof in the Di&s;pen&s;ations of his Grace to the Children of Men.</HI></P>
<P>When we read of God's willing the Salvation of all Men, we are to con&s;ider it as &s;poken after the Manner of Men, and in Accommodation to our Capacities: And we are to un|der&s;tand it after the &s;ame Manner as when we read of God's being <HI>angry,</HI> or <HI>vexed,</HI> or <HI>grieved,</HI> or that he <HI>repented</HI> of the Evil he thought to do; which Affections of Mind we may not attribute to God ju&s;t in the &s;ame Manner as we do to our &s;elves; becau&s;e they would be incon&s;i&s;tent with an infi|nitely perfect Being; and interrupt the perfect Tranquillity that forever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the divine Mind. So God's willing the Salvation of all Men, is not &s;uch a willing, as will give any Interruption to the divine Happine&s;s, tho' it be not ac|compli&s;hed: For altho' they be not all &s;aved, yet he is God ble&s;&s;ed for ever.</P>
<P>And therefore when it is &s;aid, God will have all Men to be &s;aved, it is to be under&s;tood, that the Declarations he has made of him&s;elf in his Word, and the Di&s;pen&s;ation of Grace he has put us under, are evident Tokens of &s;uch a Willingne&s;s in God. Accordingly, this may be con&s;idered as the decla|rative Will of God; as &s;uch a Willingne&s;s for the Salvation of all Men is declared in his Word: as in our Text, <HI>Who will have all Men to be &s;aved;</HI> which is expre&s;&s;ed without any Exception or Re&s;ervation; agreable to which, and further to &s;et forth the Univer&s;ality of the divine Benevolence to Mankind, &s;ays the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> 2 Epi&s;t. 3. 9. <HI>Not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but that ALL &s;hould come to Repentance.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, it may be con&s;idered as the Preceptive Will of God. He wills, that is, he commands, that all Men &s;hould be &s;aved; and this he does, as he commands, tho&s;e Things univer&s;ally that accompany Salvation, yea and in which Sal|vation does very much con&s;i&s;t.&mdash;The Preceptive Will of God is univer&s;al; what he &s;ays to one, he &s;ays to all who come within hearing of it. And now God may be &s;aid to will
<PB N="6" REF="006955_0008_102AC4615A70D838">
the Salvation of all Men, as truly &amp; as really as he wills they &s;hould keep his Commandments. As he wills that all Men &s;hould obey him, &s;o he wills that they &s;hould all be &s;aved; becau&s;e there is an in&s;eparable Connection between Obedience and Salvation, and the one implies the other. Thus we are told, <HI>Act.</HI> 17. 30. That <HI>God commands all Men every where to repent.</HI> Well, ju&s;t &s;o he wills that all Men every where &s;hould be &s;aved: For that Repentance which he wills, is unto Sal|vation: Nay true Repentance is Salvation; Salvation begun in the Soul: And it &s;eems by the Apo&s;tle as if Repentance and Salvation were &s;ynonimous or convertible Terms, in the forementioned 2 Pet. 3. 9. <HI>Not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but that all &s;hould come to Repentance.</HI> Where <HI>peri&s;hing</HI> and <HI>Repentance</HI> are put in Oppo&s;ition, plainly &s;ignifying that Re|pentance is the &s;ame with Salvation, which is the contrary or oppo&s;ite to peri&s;hing. So again, it is the Will of God that <HI>all Men &s;hould honour the Son even as they honour the Father,</HI> Joh. 5. 23. Well, this is as much as to will the Salvation of all Men: <HI>For this is Life eternal, to know</HI> and ho|nour the <HI>true God and Je&s;us Christ whom he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ent,</HI> Joh. 17. 3. Again, who is there but what will acknowledge that God wills Men to for&s;ake their Sins, turn to him, and lead holy Lives? For this is the Will of God, even your Sancti|fication. And if he wills that all Men &s;hould flee from Sin and follow Holine&s;s, he wills that all Men &s;hould be &s;aved, for Holine&s;s and Freedom from Sin, is that in which a great Part of our Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts. Finally here, &s;ince <HI>the Grace of God which has appeared unto all Men, bringing Salvation, teaches us to deny all Ungodline&s;s, and worldly Lusts, and to live &s;oberly, and righteou&s;ly, and godly in this pre&s;ent World,</HI> (Tit. 2. 11, 12.) it mu&s;t be allowed to be the Will of God that we &s;hould all thus live; and this is to will the Salvation of all: For it is in this Way that the Grace of God brings Salva|tion unto us.</P>
<P>Now therefore, if there be any Per&s;ons who doubt whether God is really willing that all Men &s;hould be &s;aved, let them con&s;ider whether God be really willing that all &s;hould repent, that all &s;hould believe, that all &s;hould for&s;ake their Sins, and obey the Go&s;pel; and con&s;ider whether all &s;uch do not con|tradict and oppo&s;e the Will of God, who do not repent of their Sins, and live as the Go&s;pel teaches them.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="006955_0009_102AC462DBDC81E0">
And now, would it not be very &s;hocking to you, for any to &s;ay, that God was not willing that all Men &s;hould repent, that he was not willing they &s;hould all turn from their Sins, and was not willing they &s;hould all obey his Commands? Why, it is really as &s;hocking for any to &s;ay, that God is not willing that all &s;hould be &s;aved: Becau&s;e Repentance, and Faith, and Obedience, and Salvation, are &s;o interwoven toge|ther, that the one nece&s;&s;arily implies the other.</P>
<P>But then, I would go on further to &s;ay, that God wills the Salvation of all Men, as he has done and is doing tho&s;e Things which indicate &s;uch a Willingne&s;s, or are outward, open, and manife&s;t Tokens of his Willingne&s;s that all Men &s;hould be &s;aved. As particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In the all &s;ufficient Saviour he provided for &s;inful Man.</HI></P>
<P>God did not provide a Saviour who was able only to &s;ave a few of the fallen Race; but One who was able to &s;ave every Son and Daughter of <HI>Adam.</HI> I am not now con&s;ider|ing the Extent of Chri&s;t's Redemption, as to the divine Inten|tion and De&s;ign, or as to the real Event of it; for this is a &s;ecret Thing, and belongs not to us, but to God. But what I am now con&s;idering, is the Extent of his Merits, and of his Power; and con&s;idered in this Re&s;pect, it is univer&s;al. Of &s;uch infinite Virtue are the Merits of Chri&s;t's Blood, that it is &s;ufficient to take away the Sin of the whole World. If every Man in the whole World &s;hould be &s;aved, there would not need any other Sacrifice than Chri&s;t has already made of him&s;elf; and therefore with Re&s;pect to the Sufficiency of A|tonement, Chri&s;t may be &s;aid to have died for all; <HI>to have ta&s;ted Death for every Man; and to be the Propitiation for our Sins, and not for ours only, but for the Sins of the whole World.</HI> Moreover there is not only &s;uch a Sufficiency of Merit in Chri&s;t, but a Sufficiency of Power: For all Power is given to him in Heaven, and in Earth: That as his Blood was &s;ufficient to wa&s;h away the Guilt of the whole World; &s;o his Power is &s;ufficient to &s;ubdue the &s;tronge&s;t Habits of Sin, and bring us over to a willing Subjection to him, and to his Go&s;pel. So that there is every Thing in him nece&s;&s;ary to render him a compleat All-&s;ufficient Saviour to the whole World of Mankind: Surely <HI>He is able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t.</HI> And now this may be con&s;idered as a Token of God's Will|ingne&s;s that all Men &s;hould be &s;aved: For when God has
<PB N="8" REF="006955_0010_102AC4655D8A5508">
provided a Saviour able to &s;ave the whole World; what are we led to argue from thence, but that God is willing that all &s;hould be &s;aved? Who can think that God is unwilling to have the Malady healed, for which he has been at infinite Co&s;t to provide a &s;overeign Remedy? And that when he has &s;pread a Plai&s;ter large enough for the whole Sore, he &s;hould be unwilling to have it applied?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>His Willingne&s;s that all Men &s;hould be &s;aved, appears in the exten&s;ive Commi&s;&s;ion and Charge that Chri&s;t gave to his Di&s;|ciples, when he &s;ent them forth to preach the Go&s;pel of Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>Thus when our ble&s;&s;ed Lord took Leave of his Di&s;ciples, he left this in &s;olemn Charge to them, &s;aying <HI>Matth.</HI> 28. 18. 19. All Power is given to me in Heaven and in Earth; Go ye therefore <HI>and teach all Nations,</HI> baptizing them &amp;c. or as <HI>Mark</HI> gives it to us, <HI>Mar.</HI> 16 15. Go ye into <HI>all the World,</HI> and preach the Go&s;pel to <HI>every Creature;</HI> he that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved &amp;c. So that the offers of Salvation upon Go&s;|pel Terms were to be made to every Creature, that is, to every Man thro'out the whole World, without Exception. And who dare &s;ay, that when the offers of Salvation are ordered to be made to all, but that God is willing all &s;hould accept and be &s;aved?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Another Token of God's Willingne&s;s that all &s;hould be &s;aved, is the Exten&s;ivene&s;s of the Proclamation of Grace, and the very general Terms he makes u&s;e of in inviting us to Pardon and Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>I&s;ai. 55. 1. <HI>Ho, every one that thir&s;teth, come ye to the Wa|ters &amp;c.</HI> v. 7. <HI>Let the Wicked,</HI> let him be who he will, and how wicked &s;oever, and how many &s;oever; there is &s;uch an unlimited Latitude in the Words, as may extend to every wicked Man and Woman in the World: <HI>Let him for&s;ake his Way, and turn unto the Lord, and he will have Mercy on him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</HI> So Joh. 7. 37. Je&s;us &s;tood and cried, <HI>If any Man thir&s;t;</HI> any Man, or every Man if he thir&s;ts, <HI>let him come to me and drink.</HI> So Rev. 22. 17. <HI>The Spirit and the Bride &s;ay, Come, and let him that is athir&s;t &s;ay, Come, and who&s;oever will let him take of the Waters of Life freely.</HI> Now who can read &s;uch general and gracious Invitations as the&s;e in the Word of God, and doubt his Willingne&s;s that they &s;hould be &s;aved?</P>

<P>Ezek. 18. 23. <HI>Have I any Plea&s;ure at all that the Wicked &s;hould die, &s;aith the Lord God: and not that he &s;hould turn from his Way and live?</HI> v. 32. <HI>For I have no Plea&s;ure in the Death of him that dieth, &s;aith the Lord God; wherefore turn your &s;elves, and live ye.</HI> And to convince People of the Truth hereof, and not leave the lea&s;t Room for doubting in this Matter, He &s;wears by him&s;elf, by his own Life, becau&s;e he could &s;wear by no greater, Ezek. 33. 11. <HI>As I live, &s;aith the Lord God, I have no Plea&s;ure in the Death of the Wicked; but that the Wicked turn from his Way and live; turn ye, turn ye, from your evil Ways, for why will ye die, O Hou&s;e of I&s;rael?</HI> And agreable to this, &s;ays the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> in the fore-men|tioned 2 Pet. 3. 9. <HI>God is Long-&s;uffering to us-ward, not will|ing that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but that ALL &s;hould come to Repen|tance.</HI> Add to this,</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>With what Reluctance and Backwardne&s;s God's giving up any to De&s;truction is repre&s;ented; and how much he is grieved when any by their Ob&s;tinacy and final Impenitency, make it ne|ce&s;&s;ary for him as a righteous Judge to deliver them over to De|struction.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee the Workings of the divine Compa&s;&s;ion to|wards Sinners, Ho&s;. 11. 8. <HI>How &s;hall I give thee up Ephraim? how &s;hall I deliver thee, I&s;rael &amp;c. Mine Heart is turned within <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> my Repentings are kindled together.</HI> And when our ble&s;&s;ed Lord &s;aw how Jeru&s;alem had &s;inned away their Day of Grace, and were ju&s;t giving the fini&s;hing Stroke as to the filling up the Mea&s;ure of their Sins: how did his Bowels of Com|pa&s;&s;ion yearn towards them? Luk. 19. 41, 42. <HI>And when he was come near, he beheld the City, and wept over it, &s;aying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at lea&s;t in this thy Day, the Things which belong unto thy Peace; but now they are hidden from thine Eyes.</HI></P>
<P>Now, laying all the&s;e Things together, it appears mo&s;t evident, that there is in God a Willingne&s;s that all Men &s;hould be &s;aved. So that whatever be the eternal Purpo&s;es of God, which are held in his own Brea&s;t, and entirely hid from us; yet they are not &s;uch, but God does in &s;ome Sen&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="006955_0012_102AC46CF27FF698">
will the Salvation of all Men. Indeed he don't &s;o will their Salvation as to break in upon the grand Scheme of Things drawn in his own infinite Mind; nor &s;o as actually to effect it. But then, there is a Sen&s;e wherein he wills the Salva|tion of all Men; in &s;o much that with Re&s;pect to tho&s;e who finally peri&s;h, it cannot be &s;aid that they peri&s;h, becau&s;e God was not willing they &s;hould be &s;aved, but becau&s;e they would not accept of Salvation upon the Terms that it was offered to them. Not becau&s;e Chri&s;t was not able or willing to &s;ave them; but becau&s;e <HI>they would not come unto him that they might have Life.</HI>&mdash;I am &s;en&s;ible, this is a very nice Point, and the Solution of Difficulties, and an&s;wering Objections that have been &s;tarted, has puzled and per|plexed the Minds of Men: And therefore to pretend to go to the Depth of the&s;e Things, will &s;hew our Curio&s;ity and Conceit, rather than our Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Let us therefore proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P>II. <HI>As the Way and Means of Men's Salvation, God wills that they &s;hould</HI> COME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH.</P>
<P>Who will have all Men to be &s;aved, <HI>and come to the Know|ledge of the Truth:</HI> That is, as the Way and Means of their being &s;aved. As he wills them to be &s;aved, &s;o he wills them the Means of Salvation, even <HI>the Knowledge of the Truth.</HI></P>
<P>And now, if any of you a&s;k with <HI>Pilate, What is Truth?</HI></P>
<P>I an&s;wer in general, It is Chri&s;t him&s;elf, and the Go&s;pel concerning him</P>
<P>Chri&s;t him&s;elf is the Truth: The only begotten of the Father was <HI>full of Grace and Truth,</HI> Joh. 1. 14. Yea, He is <HI>the Truth,</HI> and <HI>the Life,</HI> that is, the true and living Way unto the Father. <HI>For no Man cometh to the Father but by him,</HI> Joh. 14. 6. And as Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf is <HI>the Truth,</HI> &s;o is the Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for it declares <HI>the Truth</HI> concerning him. The Go&s;pel contains the true and faithful Sayings of God; even all the Account that God has &s;een Cau&s;e to give us concerning his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the Way to Salvation by him. The Go&s;pel may be called <HI>the Truth,</HI> as it was written by In&s;piration of God, even of the Spirit of Truth, which Chri&s;t promi&s;ed to &s;end to his Di&s;ciples to lead them into all Truth, that is, all ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="11" REF="006955_0013_102AC46E75FAA638">
Truth. So then the Go&s;pel is the Truth, as it contains a true Account of Chri&s;t, of his Per&s;on, and his Offices, of his Incarnation and Life, of his Doctrines and Miracles, of his Death and Re&s;urrection, and A&s;cen&s;ion into Heaven: Of the Salvation that he hath purcha&s;ed for poor Sinners: and the Terms upon which the &s;ame is offer|ed unto us. And &s;o in &s;hort the Go&s;pel is the Truth, as it contains every Truth, nece&s;&s;ary to be known, believed and practi&s;ed, in order to our being &s;aved: For it is able to make us wi&s;e unto Salvation, thro' Faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>According, I &s;hall here &s;ay two Things,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The appointed Means of Men's Salvation is the Know|ledge of the Truth. And therefore,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. God wills that all Men &s;hould come to the Knowledge of the Truth in order to their being &s;aved.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The appointed Way and Means of Men's Salvation is the Knowledge of the Truth.</HI></P>
<P>That is, the Knowledge of Chri&s;t, and of what the Go&s;pel reveals concerning him, is the only Way that we know of, for any to come to that Faith, that Repentance, that new Obedience, as &s;hall be unto Salvation. What God can do, or may have done in &s;pecial Ca&s;es, by an Act of his &s;overeign Power and Grace, in communicating Light and Grace to their Souls, who have not had the Light of the Go&s;pel, is not for us to &s;ay. But this we mu&s;t &s;ay, that the ordinary Way of Salvation is by the Knowledge of Go&s;pel Truths. Such in general as the Fall of Man by Sin, and the Redemption wro't out by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the Repentance towards God, and the Faith toward our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the Go&s;pel Obedience, which is the Way of Salvation. And altho' a di&s;tinct and particular Knowledge of every Point of Chri&s;tian Divinity be not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation: And al|tho' there are many Truths contained in the Word of God, that are not e&s;&s;ential Truths: And altho' there be many Truths that &s;ome Men lay great Stre&s;s upon, yet are not ne|ce&s;&s;ary fundamental Articles of our Creed; yet there is a Knowledge of Go&s;pel-Truths nece&s;&s;ary, according to the or|dinary Method of Salvation. Thus,</P>
<P>As true Repentance is nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation; &s;o in order to this, there mu&s;t be a Conviction of Sin: But now, there is
<PB N="12" REF="006955_0014_102AC470DDF39A40">
no coming to the Knowledge of Sin, but by the Knowledge of the Law &amp; Go&s;pel, that Sin is the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of. Moreover, Faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Go&s;pel-Way of Salvation: But now, as the Apo&s;tle argues, Rom. 10. 14, 15. <HI>How &s;hall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard? And how &s;hall they hear, without a Preacher? And how &s;hall they preach, except they be &s;ent? So then Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.</HI> v. 17.&mdash;Furthermore, Chri&s;t is declared to be the <HI>Author of eternal Salvation to all that obey him,</HI> Heb. 5. 9. But how can they obey him, unle&s;s they have the Will of Chri&s;t made known to them, and the Rule of Chri&s;tian Obedience &s;et before them; which is done only in the Go&s;pel? In &s;hort, for the Heart of Man to be without Knowledge, Go&s;pel-Knowledge, is not good, or &s;afe for him. Multitudes, Multitudes peri&s;h for lack of this Vi&s;ion. And many of God's profe&s;&s;ing People, who live in a Land of Light, and even in the Valley of Vi&s;ion; are de&s;troyed for lack of Knowledge: <HI>Whereas to know the only true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom he hath &s;ent, is Life eternal,</HI> Joh. 17. 3.</P>
<P>Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>God wills that all Men &s;hould come to the Knowledge of the Truth, as the Way to their being &s;aved.</HI></P>
<P>And now, God's willing that Men &s;hould come to the Knowledge of the Truth, appears in the Methods he has ta|ken for &s;preading the Go&s;pel among Mankind. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>God has delivered his Word, containing all nece&s;&s;ary and &s;aving Truths, in Writing to us.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He has written to us the great Things of his Law,</HI> and of his Go&s;pel. <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 8. 12. Now by this the Record of divine Truths is pre&s;erved, to which Men may repair, as to a Stan|dard of Truth for In&s;truction, Admonition or Coun&s;el. And being written <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> gives Opportunity for its being tran&s;cri|bed or printed; and for its being tran&s;lated into all Langua|ges, and &s;o tran&s;mitted to all Nations, as well as to all Ages and Generations of Men. The Word of God being written, I &s;ay, is capable of being thus exten&s;ively u&s;eful to Man|kind.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>God's Willingne&s;s that all Men &s;hould come to the Know|ledge of the Truth, appears by the &s;olemn Charge Chri&s;t gave his Apo&s;tles about Preaching the Go&s;pel in all Parts of the World.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="006955_0015_102AC474798B5E78">
So far was Chri&s;t from confining them to the lo&s;t Sheep of the Hou&s;e of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> or to any particular People, that he charges them to go and <HI>teach all Nations;</HI> yea, to <HI>go into all the World, and preach the Go&s;pel to every Creature,</HI> Mar. 16 19. Which plainly &s;hews, that it was the declared preceptive Will of God, that every Man &amp; Woman upon Earth &s;hould have the Go&s;pel of Salvation brought to them, without any Exception. Again,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The pouring out of the holy Gho&s;t in the miraculous Gift of Tongues, was a further Evidence that it was the Will of God, that all People &s;hould come to the Knowledge of the Truth.</HI></P>
<P>For being enabled all at once to &s;peak all Manner of Lan|guages, they were fitted to go immediately to any People or Nation or Language under the whole Heavens; and by that very Gift of Tongues they were enabled not only to teach every Nation, but as it was a miraculous Gift, it &s;erved to confirm their Mi&s;&s;ion at the &s;ame Time: For in that very Gift of Tongues, they not only carried a Capacity to teach People of every Language, but a Power to confirm to &s;uch a People, that they were &s;ent of God unto them; for the&s;e very Gifts of Tongues, together with other miraculous Gifts, were the Credentials and Te&s;timonials of the divine Mi&s;&s;ion. So that if we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the Apo&s;tles, when Chri&s;t order|ed them to go and teach all Nations, had objected, &s;aying within them&s;elves, How can we go to People of a &s;trange Language, and who&s;e Words we cannot under&s;tand, nor they under&s;tand ours, who can only &s;peak our Mother-Tongue? I &s;ay, &s;uppo&s;ing the Apo&s;tles had thus objected within them|&s;elves; yet on the Day of Penteco&s;t, all tho&s;e Objections were entirely removed; for the holy Gho&s;t no &s;ooner ap|peared <HI>in cloven Tongues like as of Fire, and &s;at upon each of them,</HI> but they found them&s;elves immediately qualified to go as their Ma&s;ter had commanded them, into all the World, and to preach the Go&s;pel to every Creature: and had this comforting and encouraging Word from Chri&s;t to animate them to &s;uch a Service, <HI>Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the End of the World,</HI> Matth. 28. 20. Intimating, that it was his Will that his Apo&s;tles &s;hould go into all the World preaching the Go&s;pel of Truth unto them, and that the Know|ledge of Go&s;pel-Truths, &s;hould be pre&s;erved among them by
<PB N="14" REF="006955_0016_102AC476F014D298">
a con&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion of Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters, with whom Chri&s;t would be, by his Power and Grace, tho' in a more ordinary Way, from Age to Age, even to the End of the World. All which plainly &s;hews it to be the Will of God, that all Men &s;hould come to the Knowledge of the Truth, as the Means of Salvation.</P>
<P>I proceed now to the</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Here we &s;ee the infinite Love, and good Will of God to Man, that he is willing that all Men &s;hould be &s;aved, and has given &s;uch abundant Tokens of his Willingne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Surely God in the Go&s;pel has given a mo&s;t glorious Di&s;|play of his infinite Goodne&s;s, and of his univer&s;al Benevo|lence, triumphing over all our &s;inful Unworthine&s;s; that not|with&s;tanding the infinite Provocation we have all offered to him by Sin, &s;o that the <HI>whole World is become guilty before God,</HI> yet he has a Love of Benevolence, and Compa&s;&s;ion to all Mankind; in &s;o much that we may all unite and &s;ing with the Multitude of the heavenly Ho&s;t upon the Birth of the great Saviour, <HI>Glory to God in the highe&s;t, Peace on Earth, and GOOD WILL TOWARDS MEN,</HI> Luk. 2. 14.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Hence the final De&s;truction of Sinners will lie at their own Doors.</HI></P>
<P>They will not be able to plead, that God was not willing they &s;hould be &s;aved: for God willeth that all Men &s;hould be &s;aved. Sinners will not be able to plead, that they were willing; but God was not willing they &s;hould be &s;aved. But on the contrary, it will be charged on Go&s;pel-Sinners, that God would have gathered them as a Hen doth her Chickens under her Wings, but they would not: That when Chri&s;t invited them, they would not come unto him, that they might have Life: That when he called, they re|fu&s;ed; when he &s;tretched out his Hand, they would not regard it. And therefore in&s;tead of charging their De&s;tru|ction upon God's not being willing they &s;hould be &s;aved; their own Con&s;ciences will everla&s;tingly upbraid them, as in Prov. 5. 12. <HI>How have I hated Instruction, and mine Heart de&s;pi&s;ed Reproof?</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="15" REF="006955_0017_102AC478A6DC70C8">
3. <HI>What infinite Obligations are we under to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in and by whom alone it is, that God is willing that all Men &s;hould be &s;aved?</HI></P>
<P>The dearly beloved Son of God has by his Obedience and Death, paid a Price &s;ufficient for the Sins of the whole World; &s;o that if every Sinner upon Earth was to be &s;aved, there would need no more Sacrifice for Sin: For by that one Offering of Chri&s;t, &s;uch Satisfaction is made to divine Ju&s;tice, re&s;pecting our Breaches of the divine Law, that upon the Terms of Go&s;pel-Faith and Repentance, God is recon|cilable to every Sinner upon Earth. With what Love and Gratitude then &s;hould we be filled to this great Redeemer: <HI>And how &s;hould our Souls magnify the Lord, and our Spirits re|joyce in God our Saviour?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>What Encouragement is here for all Sinners, let them be who they will, to come and be &s;aved?</HI></P>
<P>Are you never &s;o poor, and mean and de&s;picable? Nay, are you never &s;uch great and vile Sinners? Yet depend upon it, God is willing to be reconciled to you, if you will but return unto him. We have a Warrant from the Go&s;pel to &s;ay to any, and to every Sinner upon Earth, that God is willing to pardon and &s;ave him, if he will but repent, and turn, and lay hold on the Hope that is &s;et before him. If Sinners have gone to the greate&s;t Length of Sinning; yet even then it may be &s;aid, that God is willing to pardon and &s;ave them, if they will but accept of Salvation as offered in the Go&s;pel: It will not be God's Unwillingne&s;s to &s;ave, but Sinners Unwillingne&s;s to be &s;aved in the Way of the Go&s;pel, that will be their eternal De&s;truction: For <HI>him that cometh unto me,</HI> &s;ays Chri&s;t, <HI>I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out,</HI> Joh. 6. 37.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Since the Way and Means of Salvation is by the Know|ledge of the Truth, as it is in Je&s;us, and in his Go&s;pel; what an un&s;peakable Priviledge is it, to enjoy that Go&s;pel which reveals this Truth unto us?</HI></P>
<P>This is one of the greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings we can enjoy on this Side Heaven; becau&s;e it is the appointed Means of bring|ing us to Heaven at la&s;t. Let the Light of the glorious Go&s;pel be compared with meer natural Light; and e&s;pecially if we compare it with heatheni&s;h Ignorance and Darkne&s;s,
<PB N="16" REF="006955_0018_102AC47B01E2A2B0">
or with Mahometan Impo&s;tures, or with Romi&s;h Antichri&s;tian Errors, and Delu&s;ions; we &s;hall &s;ee how much they have the Advantage above all the re&s;t of Mankind, to whom are committed, and by whom are freely enjoyed the Oracles of God: It is by the In&s;trumentality of this Word of Truth, that Men are turned from Darkne&s;s to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God. How then &s;hould we and all Prote&s;tants who have the free Enjoyment of this Go&s;pel, ac|knowledge this di&s;tingui&s;hing Favour, and <HI>ble&s;s the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who hath</HI> thus <HI>ble&s;&s;ed us with all &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings in heavenly Things in Chri&s;t Je&s;us?</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>How aggravated will the Guilt and Condemnation of all &s;uch be, who have the Advantage of coming to the Knowledge of the Truth, and be &s;aved; and yet peri&s;h at la&s;t?</HI></P>
<P>Surely the&s;e of all Men will receive the heavie&s;t Doom. They will have no Cloke for their Sin; but will be utterly left without Excu&s;e. They will not be able to plead, that God was unwilling to &s;ave them; nor will they be able to plead want of Means, while they live under the clear Light of Go&s;pel-Truths: For they refu&s;e or neglect the very Means of Salvation, that God has provided; and &s;o all the Blame will lie upon them&s;elves. <HI>And this will be their Condem|nation</HI> (and none &s;o heavy as this) <HI>that Light is come into the World,</HI> and &s;hone round about them; <HI>but they have cho&s;en Darkne&s;s rather than Light, becau&s;e their Deeds were Evil.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Since the Go&s;pel contains the Knowledge of the Truth by which we may be &s;aved; of what Importance is it, that this Go&s;pel &s;hould be &s;ent into all Nations of the Earth?</HI></P>
<P>This is the Way for them to come to the Knowledge of the Truth, &s;o as to be &s;aved; and it is the very Means of Salvation that God has appointed. Surely then, there is nothing of equal Importance with this, to Mankind in gene|ral. The Nations who are de&s;titute of this Go&s;pel, are pe|ri&s;hing in Ignorance and Error: whereas this Go&s;pel is able to make them wi&s;e unto Salvation thro' Faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Wherefore of as much Importance as is the eternal Salvation of precious Souls, of &s;o much Importance is it, that they &s;hould have the Go&s;pel &s;ent unto them. We cannot wi&s;h a greater Ble&s;&s;ing to the dark benighted and bewildred World,
<PB N="17" REF="006955_0019_102AC47E6A069350">
than the Light of the Go&s;pel. And it is impo&s;&s;ible for Chri&s;tians to do a greater Kindne&s;s to the ignorant Heathen, than to &s;end the Go&s;pel to them. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the People who know the joyful Sound.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>From what we have heard we may learn, at who&s;e Door it lies, as the faulty Cau&s;e, that &s;o great a Part of Mankind are at this Day de&s;titute of the Knowledge of the Truth.</HI></P>
<P>Surely we may not lay it at God's Door: For he has not only manife&s;ted his Willingne&s;s that all Men &s;hould be &s;aved, but has publi&s;hed the Go&s;pel of Salvation, and gave expre&s;s Orders to his Apo&s;tles to go into all the World, and preach this Go&s;pel to every Creature; and they attended to his Charge, and went forth into all Parts of the known World, preaching the Go&s;pel to all Nations of the Earth. Accord|ingly the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, Rom. 10. 18. <HI>Yes verily, their Sound went into all the Earth: and their Words unto the Ends of the World.</HI> And as it was the Command of Chri&s;t, that his Go&s;pel &s;hould reach the Ends of the Earth; &s;o we may conclude, that it is agreable to his Will, that when any Part of the World is de&s;titute of the Go&s;pel, it &s;hould be &s;ent unto them. Surely he is willing that all &s;hould come to the Knowledge of the Truth; and has done &s;o much in order to it, as abundantly to &s;hew his Willingne&s;s: And therefore that &s;o great a Part of the World at this Day lies in Igno|rance, is not to be attributed to God's Unwillingne&s;s that they &s;hould receive the Go&s;pel; but it is to be attributed to the Oppo&s;ition, the Backwardne&s;s, the Negligence and Sloth of &s;ome or other of the Children of Men, as the faulty Cau&s;e hereof.</P>
<P>Indeed, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that the further Inter|po&s;itions of divine Providence, and the Influences of the Spirit, are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the further Spreading the Go&s;pel in the World. It depends upon God, who has the Hearts of all in his own Hands, to rai&s;e up, qualify for, and &s;pirit Men unto &s;uch a difficult &amp; &s;elf denying Service. It is with God al&s;o to enlarge the Hearts of the Rich &amp; Great, to &s;upport &s;uch Mi&s;&s;ionaries, who &s;hall carry the Go&s;pel to dark and di&s;tant Regions. And it likewi&s;e depends upon the divine Influence, to open a Door of Entrance for the Go&s;pel among &s;uch who naturally oppo&s;e the Principles and
<PB N="18" REF="006955_0020_102AC480E73FB2F0">
Precepts thereof; and to render it finally &s;ucce&s;sful: For altho' <HI>Paul planteth, and Apollos watereth,</HI> yet <HI>God giveth the Increa&s;e,</HI> 1 Cor. 3. 6. And yet it mu&s;t not be attributed to God, but to Man, as the faulty Cau&s;e, that &s;o great a Part of the World &s;till lies in Ignorance.</P>
<P>Here then let me &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It is to be attributed partly to a People's not receiving and embracing the Go&s;pel when brought unto them.</HI></P>
<P>Thus when the Apo&s;tles brought the Go&s;pel to &s;ome Pla|ces, it was generally di&s;believed, and de&s;pi&s;ed, and &s;o rejected by them; They believed not the Report of the Go&s;pel, but treated it with Reproach and Contempt; as the <HI>Athenians</HI> did, when the Apo&s;tle brought the Go&s;pel to them: For altho' &s;ome few believed, yet the Generality of them mocked, <HI>Act.</HI> 17. 32. calling him <HI>a Babler, and a &s;etter forth of &s;trange Gods,</HI> v. 18. So if the Go&s;pel was treated with &s;uch Contempt at <HI>Athens,</HI> and with cruel Outrage at &s;ome other Places, it was not of God, but of them&s;elves, and their own Fault, if they continued in their heatheni&s;h Ignorance.</P>
<P>Moreover,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It has been from People's not retaining the Go&s;pel, but &s;uffer|ing it by their Indifferency and Neglect to die away among them.</HI></P>
<P>This has been long ago the &s;ad Ca&s;e of many Places, where the Go&s;pel was preached, and at fir&s;t embraced, and Go&s;pel Churches founded, and in a flouri&s;hing State for a while; but by &s;inking away into <HI>Laodicean</HI> Lukewarmne&s;s, and Indifference about the Go&s;pel, Chri&s;tian Knowledge, as well as Holine&s;s, langui&s;hed and died away. The &s;even Golden Candle&s;ticks, or famous Churches of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> have been awful In&s;tances hereof, as well as many other Places; in that Part of the World e&s;pecially: For there, where Chri&s;tianity fir&s;t began, and flouri&s;hed in the primitive Ages of it, they by their Negligence, Sloth, and want of Zeal for the Go&s;pel, have &s;o lo&s;t it, that there are &s;carcely the Foot&s;teps of Chri&s;tianity left among them; but they are over&s;pread and &s;wallowed up with <HI>Mahometan</HI> Impo&s;tures. And many other Places which have had the Go&s;pel once among them, have let it drop by Degrees, and returned to heatheni&s;h Ignorance and Error.</P>

3. <HI>The pre&s;ent Ignorance and Darkne&s;s of &s;o great a Part of the World is owing to the &s;hameful Backwardne&s;s of Chri&s;tians to carry the Go&s;pel to them.</HI></P>
<P>Chri&s;tians have not &s;uch a Zeal for Spreading the Go&s;pel as the Importance of the Thing calls for. Tho&s;e who might be proper Per&s;ons to carry the Everla&s;ting Go&s;pel to the poor peri&s;hing Heathen, choo&s;e rather to &s;it down in Ea&s;e at Home, than to engage in &s;uch difficult and &s;elf-denying Service, as to carry the Go&s;pel to the dark and di&s;tant Re|gions of the Earth. There is &s;uch a general Backwardne&s;s to go forth upon &s;uch Errands, that when God does as it were inquire, as in I&s;ai. 6. 8. <HI>Whom &s;hall I &s;end, and who will go for us?</HI> It is a rare Thing to find one &s;o touched as with <HI>a live Coal from off the Altar;</HI> &s;o fired with a Zeal for the Glory of God, and the Salvation of Souls, as to an&s;wer with the Prophet, <HI>Here am I, &s;end me.</HI> But they &s;eem all with one Con&s;ent to make Excu&s;e. Verily, if they who are qualified for the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try, had &s;uch a Love to Chri&s;t, and &s;uch a Concern for his Honour, and the Enlargement of his King|dom as they ought to have; &s;o great a Part of the World would not lie in Ignorance and Darkne&s;s, as now it does. The Go&s;pel would at lea&s;t be carried to them, and they would have Go&s;pel-Light and Grace offered to them, whe|ther they received, or rejected it.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>It is very much owing to the Backwardne&s;s of profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians to expend of their Substance for the Support and En|couragement of tho&s;e who have been inclined to go forth upon &s;uch difficult Service.</HI></P>
<P>Altho' many gracious and generous Souls in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and in other Chri&s;tian Nations, have given liberally out of their E&s;tates for propagating the Go&s;pel in heatheni&s;h and ignorant Parts of the World; yet it mu&s;t be &s;aid, that in general there has been a narrow &s;tingy Spirit, among pro|fe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians upon this Account, whereby the Cau&s;e has been very much &s;tarved; and Per&s;ons di&s;couraged and di&s;heartned in the Undertaking. This is the unhappy Ca&s;e, People choo&s;e rather to lay out their Wealth to indulge their Luxury, and gratify their Pride, than to propagate the Go&s;pel, and &s;pread the Knowledge of the Truth.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="20" REF="006955_0022_102AC485415385F8">
5. <HI>It is very much owing to the unexemplary, unbecoming Carriage of Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ors.</HI></P>
<P>Chri&s;tians have not recommended the Go&s;pel by their Ex|ample, as they &s;hould have done. Pagani&s;m, Mahometi&s;m, or Antichri&s;tiani&s;m, would not have kept their Ground, or pre|vailed as they have done, if Chri&s;tians had in any good Mea|&s;ure lived up to their Character: But the loo&s;e and &s;inful Be|haviour of &s;ome who wear the Name of Chri&s;tians, have pre|judiced Multitudes again&s;t Chri&s;tianity: For they judging the Chri&s;tian Religion by the Lives of &s;ome who profe&s;s it, could not but have an ill Opinion of it. Whereas, if Chri&s;ti|ans, whenever they went Abroad, and among Strangers, were careful to live up to Chri&s;tian Precepts and Principles, they would greatly recommend it to others: Hence our Saviour &s;o earne&s;tly inculcates an exemplary Life, on all his Di&s;ci|ples, as the Way to bring others to receive and embrace Chri&s;tianity. Matth. 5. 16. <HI>Let your Light &s;o &s;hine before Men, that they may &s;ee your good Works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore,</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Let Chri&s;tians all be humble, that there has been &s;o little done by them for Spreading the Go&s;pel; and be exhorted to be&s;tir them&s;elves more vigorou&s;ly than ever, that the poor</HI> ignorant beathen <HI>might come to the Knowledge of the Truth, and be &s;aved.</HI></P>
<P>And there are many Things may be offered to Con&s;idera|tion, that may &s;erve to humble Chri&s;tians for their Neglects, and move them to do their Duty in this Matter. Thus,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Fir&s;t of all, the Argument of our Text is a very cogent one.</HI></P>
<P>Would God have all Men to be &s;aved, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth, as the Means of their Salvation? We may then very certainly conclude, it is agreable to the Will of God, that Chri&s;tians &s;hould do all they can, to &s;pread the Go&s;pel of Salvation among Mankind. Shall the great God, who has been &s;o affronted by our Sins, be will|ing notwith&s;tanding, that all Men &s;hould be &s;aved? And &s;hall we feel a Backwardne&s;s, or Indifferency about their Sal|vation? Shall God be willing for the Salvation of all Men; and &s;hall we be concerned only for our own Salvation, and the Salvation of our Friends &amp; Neighbours? Surely, true Grace is a more generous Principle than this.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="21" REF="006955_0023_102AC4879455D750">
2. <HI>The Example of our dear Saviour, is a mo&s;t powerful Argument why we &s;hould encounter the greate&s;t Difficulties to promote the Salvation of Men.</HI></P>
<P>He deny'd him&s;elf to make Way for our Salvation: and &s;o ought every one, as he would approve him&s;elf a true Di&s;|ciple of Chri&s;t. <HI>If any Man will come after me, let him deny him|&s;elf, and take up his Cro&s;s, and follow me,</HI> Math 16. 24. Did Chri&s;t the Son of God, to bring about our Salvation, leave the Bo&s;om of the Father, and the Realms of Light &amp; Glory above, and come down to this our Earth? And &s;hall &s;uch who are qualified for it, make &s;uch a Difficulty in leaving their Father's Hou&s;e, or their native Land, to carry the Go&s;pel of Salvation to other People? Did Chri&s;t &s;ubmit to be a Man of Sorrows, and to be acquainted with Grief; yea did he &s;ubmit to the cur&s;ed &amp; cruel Death of the Cro&s;s, to pur|cha&s;e Salvation for us; what a Shame then, that Chri&s;tians &s;hould be &s;o backward to undertake any hard &amp; difficult Service for bringing about the Salvation of Men? Moreover, do we &s;ee the Grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that altho' he was Rich, yet for our Sakes he became Poor, that we thro' his Poverty might be made rich? What a Shame then, that Chri&s;tians &s;hould be backward of giving out of their Abundance, for Spreading the Knowledge of the Truth, the appointed Means of Salvation? I am per&s;waded, there are many pro|fe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians, who have not duly con&s;idered, what they &s;hall an&s;wer, if Chri&s;t &s;hould thus expo&s;tulate the Matter with them.</P>
<P N="3">3. Again, <HI>Con&s;ider that a diligent Endeavour to &s;pread the Go&s;pel of Salvation, is but a grateful Return to God our Savi|our.</HI></P>
<P>Has Chri&s;t at &s;o dear a Rate purcha&s;ed Salvation for us; and has he favoured us with the Go&s;pel, that &s;hews us the Path of Life? Surely, Gratitude to Chri&s;t obliges us to do what we can, for the Spreading the Go&s;pel: whereby Chri&s;t's Intere&s;t may increa&s;e, his Kingdom inlarge; and &s;o his Glory be advanced.</P>
<P N="4">4. Again, <HI>This will be but to love our Neighbour as our &s;elves.</HI> Which is the Sum and Sub&s;tance of the &s;econd Table of the moral Law; and what the Go&s;pel of God
<PB N="22" REF="006955_0024_102AC48B890094A8">
our Saviour (which we enjoy,) indi&s;pen&s;ably obliges unto. For who is there that loves his Neighbour as him&s;elf, that is not ready to do what in him lies, that his Fellow. Men may enjoy the &s;ame Means of Salvation, that he him&s;elf is favoured with.</P>
<P N="5">5. Again, <HI>Let it be con&s;idered that our diligent and vigorous promoting the Salvation of others, will turn to our own good Account in the Conclu&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>They who go forth upon &s;uch a Service, &s;hall have an a|bundant Reward, if they have been faithful, even altho' they &s;hould fail of the de&s;ired Succe&s;s: But if they be the happy Means of Spreading Salvation, and of <HI>turning many to Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s; they &s;hall &s;hine as the Firmament, and as the Stars for ever and ever,</HI> Dan. 12. 3. And as for tho&s;e who ex|pend of their Sub&s;tance in this Way, from a true Chri&s;tian Charity; they will find it laid out to the be&s;t Advantage. It will be in a Sort tran&s;mitting their Goods to Heaven be|fore-hand; and there laid up in Store as a good Foundation again&s;t the Time to come. <HI>This, This,</HI> my Brethren, is the Way <HI>to make to your &s;elves Friends of the Mammon of Unrigh|teou&s;ne&s;s; that when ye fail, will receive you to everla&s;ting Habitations,</HI> Luk. 16. 9.</P>
<P N="6">6. Again, <HI>Con&s;ider with what Faith, or indeed with what Face. Chri&s;tians can pray for the Conver&s;ion and Salvation of the Heathen, without be&s;tirring them&s;elves in &s;ome Way or other for their coming to the Knowledge of the Truth?</HI></P>
<P>Prayers mu&s;t be accompanied with Endeavours, &s;o far as it lays in the Way of Chri&s;tians. And they who pray for the Salvation of the Heathen; and yet have no Heart to be&s;tir them&s;elves in any Way to promote the &s;ame; how can they think their Prayers will find any Acceptance with God?</P>
<P N="7">7. Finally, <HI>Con&s;ider in what Way we can expect the igno|rant Heathen World, &s;hould come to the Knowledge of the Truth, but by Per&s;ons being &s;ent forth, and &s;upported in that Service?</HI></P>
<P>We don't except any new Revelation to be made to the World; or to have this Go&s;pel Revelation carried by Angels to the ignorant Heathen. This Trea&s;ure of the Go&s;pel has hitherto been in, and conveyed by &s;uch earthen Ve&s;&s;els from
<PB N="23" REF="006955_0025_102AC48D0AB6E798">
Place to Place. And we have no Rea&s;on to think it will be otherwi&s;e: But that when the Knowledge of the Truth &s;hall &s;pread, and fill the Earth, as the Waters do the Seas; it will be carried to them by Men &s;ubject to like Pa&s;&s;ions with our &s;elves. And therefore Chri&s;tians do but fall in with the di|vine Methods, that have hitherto been, and we have Rea&s;on to think will be, in &s;ending forth and &s;upporting well quali|fied Per&s;ons to carry the Go&s;pel Light to the People that &s;it in Darkne&s;s? And we have no Rea&s;on to expect the Know|ledge of Go&s;pel-Truth to &s;pread in the World any other Way.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t indeed be acknowledged that in this Way there are many Difficulties and Di&s;couragements. As particularly, that they are of different Languages, that we cannot under|&s;tand one another: And that we have not the extraordinary and miraculous Gift of Tongues, as the Apo&s;tles had. But to this it may be &s;aid, that there is no Language, but what by Patience and Diligence may be learnt: And many Peo|ple for the Sake of Trade; yea, and meerly for the Sake of appearing polite in the World, will take pains to learn a fo|reign Language. And why &s;hould they not be as willing to learn a &s;trange Language, for the &s;preading Religion, and for the promoting the Salvation of Souls?</P>
<P>And altho' ordinary Mini&s;ters have not Power to confirm their divine Mi&s;&s;ion with divers Signs and Miracles, as the primitive Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t had; yet if Mini&s;ters would now go forth with &s;incere fervent De&s;ires to promote the Kingdom of Chri&s;t; They may hope for his Pre&s;ence to &s;upport, a&s;&s;i&s;t and pro&s;per them; and &s;o to concur with the Influences of his Spirit, as that the Word they preach &s;hall come with convincing Power upon the Hearts of Hearers.</P>
<P>But if others &s;hould go on to object by Way of Di&s;cou|ragement, the Un&s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s of &s;uch Mi&s;&s;ions in Times pa&s;t: It may be an&s;wered, <HI>that</HI> ought not to di&s;courage Chri&s;tians from going on in &s;uch pious and charitable At|tempts. It &s;hould lead us indeed to con&s;ider by what Means former Attempts have failed of the de&s;ired Succe&s;s; and to correct &s;uch Mi&s;takes as appear to have been in them: But we mu&s;t go on &s;till in further Attempts, waiting upon God to &s;et in with his almighty Spirit and Grace, to open a wide and effectual Door to &s;uch faithful Mi&s;&s;ionaries.
<PB N="24" REF="006955_0026_102AC48E8DCE8008">
Former Di&s;appointments &s;hould by no Means hinder us from further Endeavours; for if God has not as yet in all Re&s;pects an&s;wered our Expectations; yet we know not how &s;oon he may. Eccl. 11. 6. <HI>In the Morning &s;ow thy Seed; in the Evening keep not back; for thou knowe&s;t not which &s;hall pro&s;per, this or that.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>How is God to be acknowledged; and the Memory of &s;uch to be e&s;teemed and honoured, who have in their Life-time, or at their Death, given out of their E&s;tates, for the Support and Encouragement of tho&s;e who &s;hall carry the Knowledge of the Truth into the dark Corners of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>In all pious and charitable Benefactions, God is thankfully to be acknowledged: By who&s;e Providence and Grace it is, that Per&s;ons are &s;tirred up, and have their Hearts enlarged to give of their worldly Goods for the Encouragement and Support of tho&s;e who go forth to preach the Go&s;pel in dark and di&s;tant Lands. But altho' God is to be acknowledged, and Glory given to him in the fir&s;t Place; yet great Re&s;pect and Honour is due to &s;uch whom God enables, in larges, and inclines to give to &s;uch pious U&s;es.</P>
<P>And here I would ob&s;erve, that under God, it is owing to &s;uch pious and charitable Chri&s;tians in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> that the honourable Commi&s;&s;ioners, and Corporation of the College, are enabled to &s;end forth &s;everal Mi&s;&s;ionaries among the Indians, and carry the Knowledge of Go&s;pel Truths, and &s;o the appointed Means of Salvation to them. And al|tho' there has not been at all Times the de&s;ired, and the hoped for Succe&s;s; yet it mu&s;t be acknowledged to the Glory of divine Grace, that the faithful Labours of the&s;e Mi&s;&s;ionaries, have not been in vain. For many have been brought to the Knowledge of the Truth; yea, Tokens of Grace, and Things that accompany Salvation, have been found upon good Numbers of them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>vid.</HI> The Rev.

<P>And therefore without any further Delay, to you, <HI>Dear Sir,</HI> would I now apply my &s;elf.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indian</HI> Plantation to which you are now to be &s;ent, was in former Days, a very con&s;iderable one; and had in the very early Times of <HI>New-England,</HI> the Go&s;pel of Sal|vation brought to them: And many of them brought to the Knowledge, yea, it is rea&s;onably believed, to the &s;aving Knowledge of the Truth, by the indefatigable Labours of the late aged and venerable Mr. ELIOT, who for his abun|dant Labours among the <HI>Indians</HI> in their &s;everal Planta|tions about in the Country, has been &s;tiled the <HI>New-England Apo&s;tle.</HI> After who&s;e Death the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Natick</HI> were oc|ca&s;ionally in&s;tructed by &s;ome Neighbouring Mini&s;ters: till at Length for the Space of about thirty Years pa&s;t, the Go&s;pel has been preached to them in a more &s;tated Way by their late worthy and faithful Pa&s;tor, who has by his Death cea&s;ed from his Labours, and we tru&s;t, gone to receive the Reward of them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Rev. Mr. <HI>Oliver Peabody.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>And altho' the <HI>Indians</HI> have been in a declining State for many Years, as to their Numbers; yet &s;till there is a Rem|nant, and we hope a Remnant according to the Election of divine Grace; which together with a &s;mall Number of <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Inhabitants, are this Day to be committed to your Charge.</P>
<P>And now, &s;ince it is the Will of God that all Men &s;hould be &s;aved, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth as the Means thereof; it is the ju&s;t Expectation of God and Man, that you faithfully endeavour that they may all come to, &amp; be pre&s;erved in the Knowledge of divine, Go&s;pel-Truth.&mdash;We tru&s;t &amp; hope you have felt the Power of the&s;e divine Truths upon your own Soul; and have a due Sen&s;e of the Worth, the Importance, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of them: And that you will endeavour that every Member of your Charge may come to the &s;aving experimental Knowledge of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>It is but a little Flock that you will have under your im|mediate Care: But they are &s;uch as will require a great deal
<PB N="26" REF="006955_0028_102AC494C4F63F98">
of Pains to be taken with them, and who will need not only your publick, but more private In&s;tructions, even from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e. Mo&s;t of them are but as Children in Knowledge; and &s;o will require, <HI>Line upon Line; Precept upon Precept; here a little, and there a little.</HI> Let not the Smallne&s;s of your Flock tempt you to Slackne&s;s in your Bu|&s;ine&s;s; but put you upon taking a more &s;pecial Care of every Individual.</P>
<P>You will bear it always upon your Mind, that the Truth you are to in&s;truct them in, and inculcate upon them, is Go&s;pel-Truth; and that it will be of little Service to in&s;i&s;t upon nice Speculations, or Matters of doubtful Di&s;putation with them; but the grand e&s;&s;ential Points of Doctrine, and the practical Truths of the Go&s;pel, will be more to the Pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>And here for your quickning to Diligence and Faithful|ne&s;s, I would have you con&s;ider, that altho' but a few Souls will be committed to your immediate Care; yet they are <HI>Souls precious, and immortal Souls,</HI> and will de&s;erve your ut|mo&s;t Care: And you mu&s;t be faithful in a few Things, if you would have the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Euge</HI> at la&s;t, and be made Ruler over many Things.</P>
<P>Furthermore, I would ob&s;erve to you, that as it is the <HI>Indian</HI> Intere&s;t, you are more e&s;pecially to be concerned in; and will be chiefly &s;upported by Monies given for promot|ing the Knowledge of Chri&s;t among that poor and &s;eemingly for&s;aken People; &s;o it will very well become you to exer|ci&s;e your Thoughts and Cares, not meerly for the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Natick;</HI> but that you have at Heart the Intere&s;t of Religion among the <HI>Indians</HI> in all Parts of the Land; and endeavour as you have Opportunity to promote and encourage the Spreading the Go&s;pel among tho&s;e di&s;tant Tribes, which do &s;till lie in Ignorance.</P>
<P>And Oh! may the happy Times come, when Per&s;ons &s;hall be rai&s;ed up, qualified for, and &s;pirited to carry the Everla&s;ting Go&s;pel of Truth, to all the dark Corners of our Land: That &s;o the poor ignorant Tribes of <HI>Indians,</HI> may be turned from Darkne&s;s to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God!</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="006955_0029_102AC4964AAB8970">
As for the Ea&s;tern Tribes, to the Shame of Prote&s;tants it mu&s;t be &s;poken; That the Romi&s;h Prie&s;ts were more early, and more earne&s;t in &s;preading their Principles among them, than we Prote&s;tants have been. By which Means they have gained &s;uch Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and &s;tirred up &s;uch Prejudices in them, that it is become exceeding difficult to per&s;wade them now to &s;trip their Religion of tho&s;e Anti|chri&s;tian Errors and Delu&s;ions that have been impo&s;ed upon them, and to embrace the plain and &s;imple <HI>Truth as it is in Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>And as for the We&s;tern Tribes, they have been hitherto, mo&s;t &s;hamefully neglected: And would to God, that the Engli&s;h Government which lies neare&s;t to them, would &s;eri|ou&s;ly con&s;ider how they will an&s;wer it, another Day; that they have done &s;o little to propagate Chri&s;tian Knowledge among them: But that in&s;tead thereof &s;o many Blocks and Di&s;couragements have been laid in the Way to hinder others from undertaking and engaging in &s;o good a Work.</P>
<P>And I think it highly becomes <HI>This,</HI> and all the Neigh|bouring Governments, to exert them&s;elves with Speed and Vigour in this Matter; that tho&s;e poor People, who have for unknown Ages &s;at in Darkne&s;s, in the Region, and Sha|dow of Death, might at Length have the great and glorious Light of the Go&s;pel &s;pring up among them. I &s;ay, we ought to be <HI>&s;peedy</HI> as well as vigorous in our Endeavours in this Matter; before our French Neighbours &s;hall &s;pread An|tichri&s;tian Errors and Prejuices among them; which we un|der&s;tand they are at this Day earne&s;tly &s;triving for.</P>
<P>O let us not be more backward to &s;pread <HI>Truth, the glori|ous Truths of the Go&s;pel;</HI> than they are to &s;pread dangerous Errors: But let us out of an hearty Regard for the Honour and Intere&s;t of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and out of a Love to the poor and peri&s;hing Souls of the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> take &s;ome effectual Me|thods to &s;end the Go&s;pel in its Purity among them&punc; And by this Means we &s;hall be in the Way not only of doing un|&s;peakable Benefit to them; but of reaping great Advantage to our &s;elves thereby: This being the mo&s;t likely Method to &s;ecure Peace, and maintain a friendly Corre&s;pondence with them. But altho' this political Argument may very properly be thought of by us, and have con&s;iderable Weight with us;
<PB N="28" REF="006955_0030_102AC499A1764CA8">
yet the other Arguments, &s;uch as the Honour of Chri&s;t, and the &s;aving Good of their Souls, are the higher and more ge|nerous Motives, and ought to have the principal Sway with us. And indeed, if true Chri&s;tian, gracious and generous Love, did but glow with a &s;acred Ardor in the Brea&s;ts of Chri&s;tians, the&s;e poor <HI>Indians</HI> would not lie neglected; but &s;ome pious Candidates for the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, would ge|nerou&s;ly offer them&s;elves, &s;aying, one and another of them, <HI>Here am I, &s;end me.</HI> And others would readily contribute of their E&s;tates to the laying &s;ome generous Fund, for the Sup|port of &s;uch Mi&s;&s;ionaries and School-Ma&s;ters, as &s;hall thus offer them&s;elves.</P>

<P>WHEREAS you on whom we now lay our Hands, have received a Call to the Work of the Mini&s;try, and to the pa&s;toral Office in the Church lately ga|ther'd at <HI>Natick;</HI> and have accepted the &s;ame: We do in the Name of Chri&s;t, and by His Authority, <HI>Ordain</HI> you to be a <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> of the Everla&s;ting Go&s;pel, and a <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> to the &s;aid Flock.</P>
<P>And we Charge you before God, and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who &s;hall judge the Quick and the Dead at his Ap|pearing and his Kingdom, that you fulfill the Mini&s;try which you have received of the Lord.</P>
<P>Take heed to thy &s;elf, and to all the Flock over which the Holy Gho&s;t maketh you an Over&s;eer; to feed the Church of God, which He hath purcha&s;ed with his own Blood.</P>
<P>For this End, give thy &s;elf continually to Prayer, and to the Mini&s;try of the Word.</P>
<P><HI>Pray for all Men,</HI> for Kings, and for all in Authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable Life in all Godline&s;s and Hone&s;ty.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="006955_0032_102AC49F92AEB318">
And when you go to the Throne of Grace, let the Peo|ple of God, and particularly this Flock, lie near your Heart; and cea&s;e not to make mention of them in your Prayers.</P>
<P><HI>Preach the Word:</HI> Be in&s;tant in Sea&s;on, out of Sea&s;on; Reprove, Rebuke, Exhort, with all Long-&s;uffering and Doctrine. Study to &s;hew thy &s;elf approved unto God, a Workman that needeth not to be a&s;hamed, rightly di|viding the Word of Truth. In Doctrine &s;hew Uncorrupt|ne&s;s, Gravity, Sincerity, &s;ound Speech that cannot be con|demned. Teach God's People to ob&s;erve all Things what|&s;oever Chri&s;t hath commanded.</P>
<P><HI>Ble&s;s the Flock</HI> in the Name of the Lord our God, who is the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t: And thus put his Name upon them, that he may ble&s;s them.</P>
<P><HI>Admini&s;ter the Sacraments of the New-Te&s;tament,</HI> Bapti&s;m and the Lord's Supper, to the qualified Subjects, according to Chri&s;t's Appointment, as a faithful and good Steward of the My&s;teries of God</P>
<P><HI>Di&s;pen&s;e the Di&s;cipline of the Church of Chri&s;t,</HI> according to his Word, making a Difference between the holy and profane. Them that &s;in, rebuke before all, that others al&s;o may fear. Ob&s;erve the&s;e Things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by Partiality.</P>
<P><HI>U&s;e your be&s;t Endeavours to know the State of the Flock.</HI> And whereas they con&s;i&s;t of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> let you-watchful Care, and tender Regards be expre&s;s'd to both im|partially, giving to each their Portion in due Sea&s;on; and according to their various Circum&s;tances. Feed Chri&s;t's Sheep, feed his Lambs. Be ready to Coun&s;el and Pray with the Sick, and to &s;peak a Word in Sea&s;on to them that are weary.</P>
<P>And that you may be furni&s;hed to every good Work; <HI>Give Attendance to Reading:</HI>&mdash;Neglect not the Gift of God that is in thee. Meditate on the&s;e Things, and give thy &s;elf wholly to them, that thy profiting may appear unto all.</P>

<P>And the Things which thou ha&s;t heard of us among many Witne&s;&s;es, <HI>the &s;ame commit thou to faithful Men,</HI> who &s;hall be able to teach others al&s;o. Lay Hands &s;uddenly on no Man; neither be Partaker of other Mens Sins: Keep thy &s;elf pure.</P>
