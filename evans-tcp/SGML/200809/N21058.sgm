<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE delay of the following publication has been occa&s;ioned by the want of health to prepare it for the pre&s;s, during the winter months. It now goes forward, under the great di&s;advantages, of having been ha&s;tily copied from my notes, amid&s;t frequent pro|fe&s;&s;ional interruptions. Its imperfections I hope will be overlooked, when it is con|&s;idered, that my only de&s;ign in publi&s;hing thus prematurely, was to obviate as much as po&s;&s;ible, the danger of the di&s;ea&s;e, &s;hould it unhappily appear in our city in the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="027658_0003_0FD7C765E659F670">
In the hi&s;tory of the fever, I have intro|duced an account of the &s;ymptoms and progno&s;is, in &s;uch places as they occurred mo&s;t naturally, without a &s;trict regard to the artificial order of the &s;chools.</P>
<P>In the detail of the &s;ymptoms, I have divided the body into different &s;y&s;tems. This divi&s;ion I have found to accord more ea&s;ily with the principles of medicine which I have adopted, than the common method of de&s;cribing them, as they appear in the animal, natural, and vital functions.</P>
<P>In republi&s;hing an account of the con|trover&s;ies between the phy&s;icians of Phila|delphia, my motives were, to prevent the revival of certain opinions and modes of practice, by bringing them forward under the patronage of re&s;pectable names, and to ju&s;tify in a great mea&s;ure, from their influ|ence, the want of univer&s;al &s;ucce&s;s, by the
<PB N="v" REF="027658_0004_0FD7C824F2EBD7C8">
only &s;afe, and proper mode of treating the yellow fever. I hope I &s;hall be excu&s;ed for this part of the following work, when it is perceived, that I have been more minute in relating my own mi&s;takes, than tho&s;e of other Phy&s;icians; and that I have connected no names with the opinions and modes of practice which I have oppo&s;ed, but &s;uch as were given to the public by their au|thors, during the prevalence of the fever.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I proceed to de&s;cribe the fever which is to be the &s;ubject of this E&s;&s;ay, it will be proper to give a &s;hort account of the di&s;ea&s;es which preceded it.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of the weather during the fir&s;t &s;even months of the year, and during the time in which the fever prevailed in the city, as recorded by Mr Rittenhou&s;e, will be in&s;erted immediately after the hi&s;tory of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The MUMPS which made their appearance in December 1792, continued to prevail during the month of January 1793. Be&s;ides this di&s;order, there were many ca&s;es of catarrh in the city,
<PB N="4" REF="027658_0011_0FD7CA9633489210">
brought on chiefly by the inhabitants expo&s;ing them&s;elves for &s;everal hours on the damp ground in viewing the aerial voyage of Mr Blanchard on the 9th day of the month.</P>
<P>The weather which had been moderate in De|cember and January became cold in February. The mumps continued to prevail during this month with &s;ymptoms &s;o inflammatory, as to require in &s;ome ca&s;es two bleedings. Many people com|plained this month of pains and &s;wellings in the jaws. A few had the &s;carlatina angino&s;a.</P>
<P>The mumps, pains in the jaws, and &s;carlatina continued throughout the month of March. I was called to two ca&s;es of pleuri&s;y in this month, which terminated in a temporary mania. One of them was in a woman of ninety years of age, who re|covered. The blood drawn in the other ca&s;e, (a gentleman from Maryland) was di&s;&s;olved. The continuance of a ten&s;e pul&s;e, induced me notwith|&s;tanding to repeat the bleeding. The blood was now &s;izy. A third bleeding was pre&s;cribed, and my patient recovered. Several ca&s;es of ob&s;tinate ery&s;ipelas &s;ucceeded inoculation in children during this, and the next month, one of which proved fatal.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="027658_0012_0FD7CA98992D4830">
Blo&s;&s;oms were univer&s;al on the fruit-trees, in the gardens of Philadelphia, on the fir&s;t day of April. The &s;carlatina angino&s;a continued to be the reigning epidemic in this month.</P>
<P>There were &s;everal warm days in May, but the city was in general healthy. The birds ap|peared two weeks &s;ooner this &s;pring than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>The regi&s;ter of the weather &s;hews, that there were many warm days in June. The &s;carlatina continued to maintain its empire during this month.</P>
<P>The weather was uniformly warm in July. The &s;carlatina continued during the beginning of this month, with &s;ymptoms of great violence. A &s;on of James Shar&s;wood, aged &s;even years, had with the common &s;ymptoms of this di&s;order, great pains and &s;wellings in his limbs, accompanied with a ten&s;e pul&s;e. I attempted in vain to relieve him by vomits and purges. On the 10th day of the month, I ordered &s;ix ounces of blood to be drawn from his arm, which I ob&s;erved afterwards to be very &s;izy. The next day he was nearly well. Be|tween the 22d and the 24th days of the month, there died three per&s;ons who&s;e re&s;pective ages were 80, 92, and 96&frac12;. The weather at this time
<PB N="6" REF="027658_0013_0FD7C7546333FA68">
was extremely warm. I have el&s;ewhere taken no|tice of the fatal influence of extreme heat, as well as cold, upon human life in old people. A few bilious remitting fevers appeared towards the clo&s;e of this month. One of them under my care, ended in a tedious typhus mitior, from which the patient was recovered with great difficulty. It was the &s;on of Dr Hutchins of the i&s;land of Bar|badoes.</P>
<P>The weather for the fir&s;t two or three weeks in Augu&s;t was temperate, and plea&s;ant. The colera morbus, and remitting fevers were now common. The latter were attended with &s;ome inflammatory action in the pul&s;e, and a determination to the brea&s;t. Several dy&s;enteries appeared at this time, both in the city and in its neighbourhood. During the latter part of July, and the beginning of this month, a number of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed inhabitants of St Domingo, who had e&s;caped the de&s;olation of fire and &s;word, arrived in the city. Soon after their arrival, the influenza made its appearance, and &s;pread rapidly among our citizens. The &s;car|latina &s;till kept up a feeble exi&s;tence among chil|dren. The above di&s;ea&s;es were univer&s;al, but they were not attended with much mortality. They prevailed in different parts of the city, and each &s;eemed to appear occa&s;ionally to be the ruling
<PB N="7" REF="027658_0014_0FD7CA9A6B63DD48">
epidemic. The weather continued to be warm and dry. There was a heavy rain on the 25th of the month, which was remembered by the citi|zens of Philadelphia as the la&s;t that fell, for many weeks afterwards.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething in the heat and drought of the &s;ummer months, which was uncom|mon, in their influence upon the human body. Labourers every where gave out (to u&s;e the coun|try phra&s;e) in harve&s;t, and frequently too when the mercury in Fahrenheit's thermometer was un|der 84&deg;. It was a&s;cribed by the country people to the calmne&s;s of the weather, which left the &s;weat produced by heat and labour, to dry &s;lowly upon the body.</P>
<P>The crops of grain and gra&s;s were impaired by the drought. The &s;ummer fruits were as plentiful as u&s;ual, particularly the melons, which were of an excellent quality. The influence of the weather upon the autumnal fruits, and upon vegetation in general, &s;hall be mentioned hereafter.</P>
<P>I beg pardon for the length of this introduction. Some parts of it, I hope, will not appear u&s;ele&s;s in the &s;equel of this work.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="027658_0015_0FD7CA9C9AACF2F0">
I now enter upon a detail of &s;ome &s;olitary ca&s;es of the epidemic, which &s;oon afterwards &s;pread di&s;tre&s;s through our city, and terror throughout the United States.</P>
<P>On the 5th of Augu&s;t, I was reque&s;ted by Dr Hodge to vi&s;it his child. I found it ill with a fever of the billious kind, which terminated (with a yellow &s;kin) in death on the 7th of the &s;ame month.</P>
<P>On the 6th of Augu&s;t, I was called to Mrs Bradford, the wife of Mr Thomas Bradford. She had all the &s;ymptoms of a bilious remittent, but they were &s;o acute, as to require two bleedings, and &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive do&s;es of phy&s;ic. The la&s;t purge &s;he took was a do&s;e of <HI>calomel,</HI> which ope|rated plentifully. For &s;everal days after her re-recovery, her eyes and face were of a yellow colour.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame day, I was called to the &s;on of Mrs M'Nair, who had been &s;eized violently with all the u&s;ual &s;ymptoms of a bilious fever. I purged him plentifully with &s;alts and creamor tartar, and took ten or twelve ounces of blood from his arm. His &s;ymptoms appeared to yield to the&s;e remedies; but on the 10th of the month
<PB N="9" REF="027658_0016_0FD7CA9D99A39170">
an haemorrhage from the no&s;e came on, and on the morning of the 12th he died.</P>
<P>On the 7th of this month I was called to vi&s;it Richard Palmer, a &s;on of Mrs Palmer in Che&s;|nut-&s;treet. He had been indi&s;po&s;ed for &s;eve|ral days with a &s;ick &s;tomach and vomiting after eating. He now complained of a fever and head-ach. I gave him the u&s;ual remedies for the bilious fever, and he recovered in a few days. On the 15th day of the &s;ame month, I was &s;ent for to vi&s;it his brother William, who was &s;eized with all the &s;ymptoms of the &s;ame di&s;order. On the 5th day his head-ach became extremely acute, and his pul&s;e fell to &s;ixty &s;trokes in a minute. I &s;u&s;pected conge&s;tion to have taken place in his brain, and ordered him to lo&s;e eight ounces of blood. His pul&s;e became more frequent, and le&s;s ten&s;e after bleeding, and he recovered in a day or two after|wards.</P>
<P>On the 14th day of this month I was &s;ent for to vi&s;it Mrs Leaming, the wife of Mr Thomas Lea|ming. I &s;u&s;pected at fir&s;t that &s;he had the influ|enza, but in a day or two, her fever put on bili|ous &s;ymptoms. She was affected with an uncom|mon di&s;po&s;ition to faint. Her pul&s;e was languid, but <HI>ten&s;e.</HI> I took a few ounces of blood from her,
<PB N="10" REF="027658_0017_0FD7C75985FBFF68">
and purged her with &s;alts, and <HI>calomel.</HI> I after|wards gave her a &s;mall do&s;e of laudanum which di&s;agreed with her. In my note book, I find I have recorded, that "&s;he was the wor&s;e for it." I was led to make this remark by its being &s;o very uncommon, for a per&s;on who had been properly bled and purged, to take laudanum in a com|mon bilious fever, without being benefited by it. She recovered however &s;lowly, and was yellow for many days afterwards.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 18th of this month, I was reque&s;ted to vi&s;it Peter A&s;ton, in Vine-&s;treet&punc; in con&s;ultation with Dr Say. I found him on the 3d day of a mo&s;t acute bilious fever. His eyes were inflamed, and his face flu&s;hed with a deep red colour. His pul&s;e &s;eemed to forbid evacua|tions. We pre&s;cribed the &s;tronge&s;t cordials; but to no purpo&s;e. We found him at 6 o'clock in the evening, &s;itting upon the &s;ide of his bed, per|fectly &s;en&s;ible, but without a pul&s;e, with cold clam|my hands, and his face of a yellowi&s;h colour. He died a few hours after we left him.</P>
<P>None of the ca&s;es which I have mentioned, excited the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion of the exi&s;tence of a yellow fever in our city; for I had frequently &s;een &s;poradic ca&s;es in which the common bilious fever
<PB N="11" REF="027658_0018_0FD7CAA1557F3068">
of Philadelphia, had put on &s;ymptoms of great ma|lignity, and terminated fatally in a few days, and now and then with a yellow colour on the &s;kin, before, or immediately after death.</P>
<P>On the 19th of this month I was reque&s;ted to vi&s;it the wife of Mr Peter Le Maigre, in Water-&s;treet, between Arch and Race-&s;treets, in con&s;ul|tation with Dr Foulke and Dr Hodge. I found her in the la&s;t &s;tage of a highly bilious fever. She vomited con&s;tantly, and complained of great heat and burning in her &s;tomach. The mo&s;t powerful cordials, and tonics were pre&s;cribed, but to no pur|po&s;e. She died on the evening of the next day.</P>
<P>Upon coming out of Mrs Le Maigre's room, I remarked to Dr Foulke and Dr Hodge, that I had &s;een an unu&s;ual number of bilious fevers, ac|companied with &s;ymptoms of uncommon malig|nity, and that I &s;u&s;pected all was not right in our city. Dr Hodge immediately replied, that a fever of a mo&s;t malignant kind had carried off four or five per&s;ons within &s;ight of Mr Le Maigre's door, and that one of them had died in twelve hours af|ter the attack of the di&s;order. This information &s;atisfied me that my apprehen&s;ions were well found|ed. The origin of this fever was di&s;covered to
<PB N="12" REF="027658_0019_0FD7CAA45B388950">
me at the &s;ame time, from the account which Dr Foulke gave me of a quantity of damaged coffee which had been thrown upon Mr Ball's wharf, and in the adjoining dock, on the 24th of July, nearly in a line with Mr Le Maigre's hou&s;e, and which had putrefied there to the great annoyance of the whole neighbourhood.</P>
<P>After this con&s;ultation I was &s;oon able to trace all the ca&s;es of fever which I have mentioned to this &s;ource. Dr Hodge lived a few doors above Mr Le Maigre's, where his child had been expo|&s;ed to the exhalation from the coffee for &s;everal days. Mrs Bradford had &s;pent an afternoon in a hou&s;e directly oppo&s;ite to the wharf and dock on which the putrid coffee had emitted its noxious effluvia, a few days before her &s;ickne&s;s, and had been much incommoded by it. Her &s;i&s;ter Mrs Leaming had vi&s;ited her during her illne&s;s, and probably caught the fever from her, for &s;he per|fectly recollected perceiving a peculiar &s;mell unlike to any thing &s;he had been accu&s;tomed to in a &s;ick room, as &s;oon as &s;he entered the chamber where her &s;i&s;ter lay. Young Mr M'Nair and Mrs Pal|mer's two &s;ons had &s;pent whole days in a compting hou&s;e, near where the coffee was expo&s;ed, and each of them had complained of having been made

&s;ick by its offen&s;ive &s;mell, and Mr A&s;ton had fre|quently been in Water-&s;treet near the &s;ource of the exhalation.</P>
<P>This di&s;covery of the malignity&mdash;extent&mdash;and origin of a fever which I knew to be highly con|tagious, as well as mortal, gave me great pain. I did not he&s;itate to name it, the <HI>Bilious remitting Yellow Fever.</HI> I had once &s;een it epidemic in Philadelphia, in the year 1762. Its &s;ymptoms were among the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions which di&s;ea&s;es made upon my mind. I had recorded &s;ome of the&s;e &s;ymptoms. I had likewi&s;e recorded its mor|tality. I &s;hall here introduce a &s;hort account of it from a note book which I kept during my ap|prentice&s;hip.</P>
<Q><P>In the year 1762, in the months of Augu&s;t, September, October, November and Decem|ber, the bilious yellow fever prevailed in Phi|ladelphia, after a <HI>very hot &s;ummer,</HI> and &s;pread like a plague, carrying off daily for &s;ome time, upwards of twenty per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The patients were generally &s;eized with ri|gors, which were &s;ucceeded with a violent fever, and pains in the head and back. The pul&s;e was full, and &s;ometimes irregular. The eyes
<PB N="14" REF="027658_0021_0FD7C75F2023A170">
were inflamed, and had a yellowi&s;h ca&s;t, and a vomiting almo&s;t always attended.</P>
<P>The 3d, 5th and 7th days were mo&s;tly criti|cal, and the di&s;ea&s;e generally terminated on one of them, in life or death.</P>
<P>An eruption on the 3d or 7th day over the body, proved &s;alutary.</P>
<P>An exce&s;&s;ive heat, and burning about the region of the liver, with cold extremities, por|tended death to be at hand.</P></Q>
<P>I have taken notice in my note book, of the principal remedy which was pre&s;cribed in this fever by my preceptor in medicine, but this &s;hall be mentioned hereafter.</P>
<P>Upon my leaving Mrs Le Maigre's, I expre&s;&s;ed my di&s;tre&s;s at what I had di&s;covered, to &s;everal of my fellow citizens.

<P>A MALIGNANT fever has lately ap|peared in our city, originating I believe from &s;ome damaged coffee, which putrified on a wharf near Arch-&s;treet.

The di&s;ea&s;e puts on all the intermediate forms of a mild remittent, and a typhus gravior. I have not &s;een a fever of &s;o much malignity, &s;o general, &s;ince the year 1762.</P>

THE governor having directed an inquiry to a&s;certain the facts, re&s;pecting the exi&s;tence of a contagious fever in the city, and the probable means of removing it, Dr Hutchin&s;on, the phy&s;ician of the port, has made the fol|lowing &s;tatement upon the &s;ubject, in a letter to Natha|niel Falconer, <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> health-officer of the port of Phila|delphia.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IMMEDIATELY on the receipt of your letter, with the enclo&s;ure from the governor, &s;ta|ting that a con&s;iderable alarm had taken place, in con&s;equence of the appearance of an infectious di&s;|order in this city, I endeavoured to take mea&s;ures to a&s;certain the facts, relative to the exi&s;tence of &s;uch di&s;ea&s;e: for this purpo&s;e, I wrote to &s;uch of my medical brethren, who had been called on to attend per&s;ons &s;uppo&s;ed to have been infected; and from their an&s;wers, as well as from my own ob&s;er|vations, I am convinced that a malignant fever has lately made its appearance in Water-&s;treet and in Ken&s;ington; principally in Water-&s;treet between Arch and Race-&s;treets. This part of the city I examined per&s;onally on Thur&s;day and Friday la&s;t, and found that ea&s;t of Front-&s;treet, and between Arch and Race-&s;treets, &s;ixty-&s;even per&s;ons were di&s;ea&s;ed, many with the malignant fever. Thir|teen of them are &s;ince dead, and numbers remain ill. For a while this fever was confined to the
<PB N="19" REF="027658_0026_0FD7CAAED5ABF558">
abovementioned part of the city, but the di&s;order is &s;preading, and now appears in other places, &s;o that &s;everal are affected in other parts of Water-&s;treet, &s;ome in Second-&s;treet, &s;ome in Vine-&s;treet, &s;ome in Carter's-alley, &s;ome in other &s;treets; but in mo&s;t ca&s;es the contagion can be traced to Wa|ter-&s;treet. Dr Say, who has attended more in this di&s;ea&s;e than any other phy&s;ician, informs me, that he fir&s;t ob&s;erved it in Ken&s;ington, on the fifth or &s;ixth of this month; that he did not perceive it in Water-&s;treet, until about the twelfth or fifteenth, but that on its appearance in the latter place, the whole neighbourhood was &s;oon affected&mdash;He fur|ther informs me, that he has at this time upwards of 40 patients, which he &s;uppo&s;es to be infected; and that he has lo&s;t about 20 patients in this di&s;ea&s;e, &s;ince its fir&s;t appearance. As far as I have been able to a&s;certain, the number of per&s;ons who have died altogether of this fever, amounts to 40 or thereabouts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The regi&s;ter of the deaths &s;hows that it amounted at that time to upwards of 150.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The general opinion both of the medical gentle|men, and of the inhabitants of Water-&s;treet is, that the contagion originated from &s;ome damaged cof|fee, or other putrified vegetable and animal matters;
<PB N="20" REF="027658_0027_0FD7C7681F8AA178">
and, on enquiry, it appears, that on a few wharfs above Arch-&s;treet, there was not only a quantity of damaged coffee, which was extremely offen&s;ive, ex|po&s;ed for &s;ome time, but al&s;o &s;ome putrid hides, and other putrid animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances. Should, however, Dr Say's opinion be well found|ed, that he ob&s;erved the di&s;ea&s;e in Ken&s;ington pre|viou&s;ly to its appearance in Water-&s;treet, this can|not be the original cau&s;e of the contagion.</P>
<P>It does not appear to be an imported di&s;ea&s;e; for I have heard of no foreigners or &s;ailors that have hitherto been infected; nor has it been found in any lodging hou&s;es; but it is, on the contrary, principally confined to the inhabitants of Water-&s;treet, and &s;uch as have done bu&s;ine&s;s, or had con|&s;iderable intercour&s;e, with that part of the city. The Di&s;pen&s;ary phy&s;icians tell me, that out of the large number of &s;ick, now under the care of that charitable in&s;titution, they have had but one per|&s;on afflicted with this fever. In the Penn&s;ylvania Ho&s;pital, the di&s;order does not exi&s;t.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e appears differently in different per|&s;ons; it puts on all the intermediate forms between a mild remittent and the wor&s;t &s;pecies of Typhus Gravior.</P>

<P>From a conviction that the di&s;ea&s;e originated in the putrid exhalations from the damaged coffee, I publi&s;hed in the American Daily Adverti&s;er of Au|gu&s;t 29th, the following &s;hort addre&s;s to the citi|zens of Philadelphia, with a view of directing the public attention to the &s;pot where the coffee lay, and thereby of checking the progre&s;s of the fever as far as it was continued by the original cau&s;e.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr DUNLAP,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A DOUBT has been expre&s;&s;ed by Dr Hutchin&s;on, in his letter to the health-officer, whe|ther the malignant fever, which now prevails in our city, originated in an exhalation from &s;ome putrid coffee on a wharf, between Arch and Race-&s;treets, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> it made its fir&s;t appearance at Ken&s;ington.
<PB N="25" REF="027658_0032_0FD7C77DED783E58">
Upon enquiry, it appears that the fir&s;t per&s;ons who died with this fever, about the 5th of the month, in that village, had been previou&s;ly expo&s;ed to the atmo&s;phere of the wharf, and that three of the crew of the Dani&s;h &s;hip, who are now ill with it at Ken&s;ington, received the &s;eeds of the di&s;ea&s;e on board their &s;hip, while &s;he lay at or near Race-&s;treet wharf. If the&s;e facts could not be a&s;cer|tained, it does not follow, that the di&s;ea&s;e was not generated by the putrid coffee; for, morbid ex|halations, it is well known, produce fevers at the di&s;tance of two and three miles, where they are not oppo&s;ed by hou&s;es, woods, or a hilly country. This is obvious to all the farmers who live in the neighbourhood of mill-ponds.</P>
<P>It is no new thing for the effluvia of putrid vegetables to produce malignant fevers. Cab|bage, onions, black pepper, and even the mild po|tatoe, when in a &s;tate of putrefaction, have all been the remote cau&s;es of malignant fevers. The noxious quality of the effluvia from mill-ponds, is derived wholly from a mixture of the putrified leaves and bark of trees, with water.</P>
<P>It is much le&s;s common for the effluvia of pu|trid animal matters to produce fevers. How &s;el|dom do we hear of them in the neghbourhood of
<PB N="26" REF="027658_0033_0FD7CAB090EB4C80">
&s;laughter-hou&s;es, or of the work-&s;hops of &s;kinners or curriers?</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations are intended to &s;erve two purpo&s;es: 1&s;t, To &s;upport the opinion of Dr Hutchin&s;on, that the malignant fever, which has excited &s;o general, and &s;o ju&s;t an alarm in our city, is <HI>not an imported</HI> di&s;ea&s;e; and, 2dly, To direct the attention of our citizens to the &s;pot from whence this &s;evere malady has been derived. It will be impo&s;&s;ible to check it during the continuance of warm and dry weather, while any of the impure matter which produced it, remains upon the pe&s;ti|lential wharf.</P>

<P>This publication had no other effect, than to produce fre&s;h clamours again&s;t the author; for the citizens as well as mo&s;t of the phy&s;icians of Phila|delphia had adopted a traditional opinion, that the yellow fever could exi&s;t among us, only by impor|tation from the We&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence, however, of a letter from Dr Foulke to the Mayor of the city, in which he had de|cided, in a po&s;itive manner in favour of the genera|tion of the fever from the putrid coffee; the mayor gave orders for the removal of the coffee, and the
<PB N="27" REF="027658_0034_0FD7C771E87116A0">
cleaning of the wharf and dock. It was &s;aid that mea&s;ures were taken for this purpo&s;e; but Dr Foulke, who vi&s;ited the place where the coffee lay, has repeatedly a&s;&s;ured me, that they were &s;o far from being effectual, that an offen&s;ive &s;mell was exhaled from it many days afterwards.</P>
<P>I &s;hall pa&s;s over for the pre&s;ent, the facts and arguments on which I ground my a&s;&s;ertion of the generation of this fever in our city. They will come in more properly in the clo&s;e of the hi&s;tory of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;eeds of the fever, whether received into the body, from the putrid effluvia of the coffee, or by contagion, generally excited the di&s;ea&s;e in a few days. I met with &s;everal ca&s;es in which it acted, &s;o as to produce a fever on the &s;ame day, in which it was received into the &s;y&s;tem, and I heard of two ca&s;es in which it excited &s;ickne&s;s, fainting, and fever, within one hour after the per&s;ons were expo&s;ed to it. I met with no in&s;tance in which there was a longer interval than &s;ixteen days, be|tween the contagion being received into the body, and the production of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>This poi&s;on acted differently in different con&s;ti|tutions, according to previous habits, to the de|grees
<PB N="28" REF="027658_0035_0FD7C774E64DD8E0">
of predi&s;po&s;ing debililty, or to the quantity and concentration of the contagion which was ap|plied to the body.</P>
<P>In &s;ome con&s;titutions the contagion was at once a remote, a predi&s;po&s;ing, and an exciting cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e; hence &s;ome per&s;ons were affected by it, who had not departed in any in&s;tance from their or|dinary habits of living, as to diet, dre&s;s, and exer|ci&s;e. But it was more frequently brought on by &s;ome predi&s;po&s;ing, or exciting cau&s;e. I &s;hall briefly enumerate each of them.</P>
<P>Whatever be the &s;pecific quality of the matter which produced the fever, it is certain, that it acted as a &s;timulus upon the whole &s;y&s;tem. In a moderate degree, it produced only a quickne&s;s and fulne&s;s of the pul&s;e, but when it was more active, it induced that &s;pecies of debility which has been happily called <HI>indirect.</HI> It is the rever&s;e of <HI>direct</HI> debility, which is produced by the ab|&s;traction of natural, and u&s;ual &s;timuli from the body. When the contagion acted with &s;o much force, as to induce indirect debility, a fever &s;ome|times followed without the aid of an exciting cau&s;e, but this was &s;eldom the ca&s;e. In ninety-nine ca&s;es out of an hundred, which came under my notice, I could di&s;tinctly trace the formation
<PB N="29" REF="027658_0036_0FD7CAB1D52A8888">
of the di&s;ea&s;e to &s;ome of the following cau&s;es, act|ing &s;eparately, or in greater or le&s;s combination, and inducing indirect or direct debility upon the &s;y&s;tem. The cau&s;es which induced <HI>indirect</HI> debi|lity were,</P>
<P N="1">1. FATIGUE of body or mind, induced by labour, by walking, riding, watching, or the like. It was labour which excited the di&s;ea&s;e &s;o univer&s;ally a|mong the lower cla&s;s of people. A long walk often induced it. Few e&s;caped it after a day, or even a few hours &s;pent in gunning. A hard trotting hor&s;e brought it on two of my patients. Perhaps, riding on hor&s;eback, and in the &s;un, was the ex|citing cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e in mo&s;t of the citizens and &s;trangers who were affected by it in their flight from the city. A fall excited it in a girl, and a &s;troke upon the head excited it in a young man who came under my care. Many people were &s;eized with the di&s;order in con&s;equence of their exertions on the night of the 7th of Septem|ber, in extingui&s;hing the fire which con&s;umed Mr Dob&s;on's printing-office, and even the le&s;s violent exerci&s;e of working the fire engines for the pur|po&s;e of laying the du&s;t in the &s;treets, added fre|quently to the number of the &s;ick.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="30" REF="027658_0037_0FD7C7782CCAE370">
2. HEAT, from every cau&s;e, but more e&s;pecially the heat of the &s;un, was a very common exciting cau&s;e of the di&s;order. It aided the &s;timulus of the contagion in bringing on indirect debility. The re|gi&s;ter of the weather during the latter end of Au|gu&s;t&mdash;the whole of September, and the fir&s;t two weeks in October, will &s;hew how much the heat of the &s;un mu&s;t have contributed to excite the di&s;|ea&s;e, more e&s;pecially among labouring people. The heat of common fires, likewi&s;e became a fre|quent cau&s;e of the activity of the contagion, where it had been received into the body; hence the greater mortality of the di&s;ea&s;e among bakers, black&s;miths, and hatters, than among any other cla&s;s of people.</P>
<P N="3">3. INTEMPERANCE in eating or drinking. A plentiful meal, and a few extra-gla&s;&s;es of wine, &s;el|dom failed of exciting the fever. But where the body was &s;trongly impregnated with the contagion, even the &s;malle&s;t deviation from the cu&s;tomary &s;timulus of diet, in re&s;pect to quality or quantity, rou&s;ed the contagion into action. A &s;upper of twelve oy&s;ters in one, and only three, in another of my patients, produced the di&s;ea&s;e. A half an ounce of meat rendered the contagion active in a lady, who had lived by my advice for two
<PB N="31" REF="027658_0038_0FD7C77966AB2798">
weeks upon milk and vegetables. A &s;upper of &s;allad dre&s;&s;ed after the French fa&s;hion, excited it in one of Dr Mea&s;e's patients. It is becau&s;e men are more predi&s;po&s;ed by their con&s;titution, and employments, to indirect debility than wo|men, and that young and middle aged per&s;ons are more predi&s;po&s;ed to this &s;pecies of debility than old people; that more men than women, and more young than old people, were affected by the di&s;order.</P>
<P>There were &s;everal exciting cau&s;es of the di&s;ea&s;e, which acted by inducing <HI>direct</HI> debility upon the &s;y&s;tem. It may appear difficult at fir&s;t &s;ight to ex|plain, how cau&s;es &s;o oppo&s;ite in their nature, as <HI>in|direct</HI> and <HI>direct</HI> debility &s;hould produce exactly the &s;ame effect. The difficulty vani&s;hes when we reflect, that the ab&s;traction of one &s;timulus, by accumulating the excitability of the &s;y&s;tem, en|crea&s;es the force of tho&s;e which remain. The contagion when received into the body, was fre|quently innocent, until it was aided by the addi|tion of a new, or by the ab&s;traction of a cu&s;tomary &s;timulus.

<P N="1">1. FEAR. This pa&s;&s;ion debilitates, only be|cau&s;e it ab&s;tracts its antagoni&s;t pa&s;&s;ion of courage.
<PB N="32" REF="027658_0039_0FD7CAB8549F3490">
In many people the di&s;ea&s;e was excited by a &s;ud|den paroxi&s;m of fear; but I &s;aw &s;ome remarkable in&s;tances where timid people e&s;caped the di&s;ea&s;e, although they were con&s;tantly expo&s;ed to it. Per|haps a moderate degree of fear &s;erved to balance the tendency of the &s;y&s;tem to indirect debility from the exce&s;&s;ive &s;timulus of the contagion, and there|by to pre&s;erve it in a &s;tate of healthy equilibrium. I am certain that fear did no harm, after the di&s;|ea&s;e was formed, in tho&s;e ca&s;es where a morbid exce&s;s of action, or pro&s;tration of the moving powers from exce&s;s of &s;timulus, had taken place. It was an early di&s;covery of this fact which led me not to conceal from my patients the true name of this fever, when I was called to them on the <HI>day</HI> of their being attacked by it. The fear, co-ope|rated with &s;ome of my remedies (to be mention|ed hereafter) in reducing the morbid excitement of the arterial &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P N="2">2. GRIEF. It was remarkable that the great|e&s;t concentration of the contagion did not pro|duce the di&s;ea&s;e in many ca&s;es in the atten|dants upon the &s;ick, while there was a hope of their recovery. The grief which followed the extinction of hope, by death, frequently produ|ced the di&s;ea&s;e within a day or two afterwards, and that, not in one per&s;on only, but often in mo&s;t
<PB N="33" REF="027658_0040_0FD7CAB955714DB8">
of the near relations of the di&s;ea&s;ed. But the di&s;|ea&s;e was al&s;o produced by a change in the &s;tate of the mind directly oppo&s;ite to that which has been mentioned. Many per&s;ons that attended patients who recovered, were &s;eized with the di&s;order a day or two after they were relieved from the toils and anxiety of nur&s;ing. The collap&s;e of the mind from the ab&s;traction of the &s;timulus of hope and de&s;ire, by their ample gratification, probably pro|duced that debility, and lo&s;s of the equilibrium in the &s;y&s;tem which favoured the activity of the contagion.</P>
<P>The effects of both the &s;tates of mind which have been de&s;cribed, have been happily illu&s;trated by two facts which are recorded by Dr Jack&s;on.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Treati&s;e on the Fevers of Jamaica, page 298.</NOTE> He tells us that the garri&s;ons of Savannah and York Town, were both healthy during the &s;iege of tho&s;e towns, but that the former became &s;ick|ly as &s;oon as the French and American armies re|treated from before it, and the latter, immediately after its capitulation.</P>
<P N="3">3. COLD. It will not be nece&s;&s;ary to pau&s;e here, to prove that cold is a negative quality, and produced only by the ab&s;ence of heat. Its action
<PB N="34" REF="027658_0041_0FD7CABAD5221090">
in exciting the di&s;ea&s;e, depended upon the dimi|nution of the nece&s;&s;ary and natural heat of the bo|dy, and thereby &s;o far de&s;troying the equilibrium of the &s;y&s;tem, as to enable the contagion to pro|duce exce&s;&s;ive or convul&s;ive motions in the blood ve&s;&s;els. The night air, even in the warm month of September, was often &s;o cool as to excite the di&s;ea&s;e where the dre&s;s and bed clothes were not accommodated to it. It was excited in one ca&s;e by a per&s;on's only wetting his feet in the month of October, and neglecting afterwards to change his &s;hoes and &s;tockings. Every change in the weather, that was &s;hort of producing fro&s;t, evi|dently encrea&s;ed the number of &s;ick people. This was obvious after the 18th and 19th of September, when the mercury fell to 44&deg;, and 45&deg;. The hopes of the city received a &s;evere di&s;appoint|ment upon this occa&s;ion, for I well recollect there was a general expectation that this change in the weather would have checked the di&s;order. The &s;ame increa&s;e of the number of &s;ick, was ob&s;erv|ed to follow the cool weather which &s;ucceeded the 6th and 7th of October, on which days the mercury fell to 43&deg; and 46&deg;.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved that tho&s;e per&s;ons who were <HI>habitually</HI> expo&s;ed to the cool air, were le&s;s liable to the di&s;ea&s;e than others. I a&s;cribe it to the <HI>ha|bitual</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="027658_0042_0FD7C782985080A8">
impre&s;&s;ion of the cool night air upon the bodies of the city watchmen, that only four or five of them out of 25 were affected by the di&s;|order.</P>
<P>After the body had been heated by violent ex|erci&s;e, a breeze of cool air &s;ometimes excited the di&s;ea&s;e in tho&s;e ca&s;es where there had been no change in the temperature of the weather.</P>
<P N="4">4. SLEEP. A great proportion of all who were affected by this fever, were attacked in the night. Sleep induced direct debility, and thereby di&s;po|&s;ed the contagion which floated in the blood, to act with &s;uch force upon the &s;y&s;tem as to de&s;troy its equilibrium, and thus to excite a fever. The influence of &s;leep as a predi&s;po&s;ing, and exciting cau&s;e was often a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the want of bed cloaths, &s;uited to the midnight or morning coolne&s;s of the air.</P>
<P N="5">5. IMMODERATE EVACUATIONS. The efficacy of moderate purging and bleeding in preventing the di&s;ea&s;e, led &s;ome people to u&s;e tho&s;e remedies in an exce&s;s, which both predi&s;po&s;ed to the di&s;|ea&s;e, and excited it. The morbid effects of the&s;e evacuations, were much aided by fear, for it was this pa&s;&s;ion which perverted the judgment in &s;uch
<PB N="36" REF="027658_0043_0FD7C7AAE677F620">
a manner, as to lead to the exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of reme|dies, which to be effectual, &s;hould only be u&s;ed in moderate quantities.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e appeared with different &s;ymptoms, and in different degrees, in different people. They both varied likewi&s;e with the weather. In de&s;cribing the di&s;ea&s;e I &s;hall take notice of the changes in the &s;ymptoms, which were produced by changes in the temperature of the air.</P>
<P>The precur&s;ors, or premonitory &s;igns of this fever were, co&s;tivene&s;s, a dull pain in the right &s;ide, defect of appetite, flatulency, perverted ta&s;te, heat in the &s;tomach, giddine&s;s, or pain in the head, a dull&mdash;watery&mdash;brilliant, yellow or red eye, dim and imperfect vi&s;ion, a hoar&s;ene&s;s, or &s;light &s;ore throat, low &s;pirits, or unu&s;ual vivacity, a moi&s;ture on the hands, a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;weat at nights, or after moderate exerci&s;e, or a &s;udden &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of night &s;weats. The dull eye, and the lowne&s;s of &s;pirits appeared to be the effects of &s;uch an exce&s;s in the &s;timulus of the contagion as to induce indirect debility, while the brilliant eye, and the unu&s;ual vivacity, &s;eemed to have been produced by a le&s;s quantity of the contagion act|ing as a cordial upon the &s;y&s;tem. More or le&s;s of the&s;e &s;ymptoms, frequently continued for two or
<PB N="37" REF="027658_0044_0FD7C7C236762768">
three days before the patients were confined to their beds, and in &s;ome people they continued du|ring the whole time of its prevalence in the city, without producing the di&s;ea&s;e. I wi&s;h the&s;e &s;ymp|toms to be remembered by the reader. They will form the corner &s;tone of a &s;y&s;tem which I hope will either eradicate the di&s;order altogether, or render it as &s;afe as an intermitting fever, or as the &s;mall pox when it is received by inoculation.</P>
<P>Frequent as the&s;e precur&s;ors of the fever were, they were not univer&s;al. Many went to bed in good health, and awoke in the night with a chilly fit. Many ro&s;e in the morning after regular and natural &s;leep, and were &s;eized at their work, or after a walk with a &s;udden and unexpected attack of the fever. In mo&s;t of the&s;e ca&s;es the di&s;ea&s;e came on with a chilly fit, which afforded by its violence or duration a tolerable pre&s;age of the i&s;&s;ue of the di&s;order.</P>
<P>Upon entering a &s;ick room where a patient was confined by this fever, the fir&s;t thing that &s;truck the eye of a phy&s;ician, was the countenance. It was as much unlike that which is exhibited in the common bilions fever, as the face of a wild, is unlike the face of a mild dome&s;tic animal. The eyes were &s;ad, watery, and &s;o inflamed in
<PB N="38" REF="027658_0045_0FD7C7C766837770">
&s;ome ca&s;es as to re&s;emble two balls of fire. Some|times they had a mo&s;t brilliant or ferocious ap|pearance&punc; The face was &s;uffu&s;ed with blood, or of a du&s;ky colour, and the whole countenance was downca&s;t and clouded. After the 10th of Sep|tember, when a determination of blood to the brain became univer&s;al, there was a preternatural dilatation of the pupil. Sighing attended in al|mo&s;t every ca&s;e. The &s;kin was dry, and frequent|ly of its natural temperature. The&s;e were the principal &s;ymptoms which di&s;covered them&s;elves to the eye, and hand of a phy&s;ician. The an|&s;wers to the fir&s;t que&s;tions propo&s;ed upon vi&s;iting a patient, were calculated to produce a belief in the mind of a phy&s;ician, that the di&s;ea&s;e under which the patient laboured, was not the prevail|ing malignant epidemic. I did not for many weeks meet with a dozen patients, who acknowledged that they had any other indi&s;po&s;ition than a com|mon cold, or a &s;light remitting, or intermitting fever. I was particularly &s;truck with this &s;elf de|ception in many per&s;ons, who had nur&s;ed relations that had died with the yellow fever, or who had been expo&s;ed to its contagion in families, or neigh|bourhoods, where it had prevailed for days and even weeks with great mortality. I &s;hall hereaf|ter trace a part of this di&s;po&s;ition in the &s;ick to deceive them&s;elves, to the influence of certain
<PB N="39" REF="027658_0046_0FD7C78E69CC35E8">
publications which appeared &s;oon after the di&s;ea&s;e became epidemic in the city.</P>

<P>I. The BLOOD VESSELS (and not the &s;tomach and bowels according to Dr Warren) are the "&s;eat and throne" of this as well as of all other fevers. I have publicly taught for &s;eve|ral years, that a fever is occa&s;ioned by a convul|&s;ion in the arterial &s;y&s;tem. When the epidemic, which we are now con&s;idering, came on with a full, ten&s;e, and quick pul&s;e, this convul&s;ion was very perceptible; but it frequently came on with a weak pul&s;e; often without any preternatu|ral frequency or quickne&s;s, and &s;ometimes &s;o low as not to be perceived without pre&s;&s;ing the artery at the wri&s;ts. In many ca&s;es the pul&s;e intermitted after the 4th, in &s;ome after the 5th, and in others after the 14th &s;troke. The&s;e intermi&s;&s;ions occur|red in &s;everal per&s;ons who were infected, but who were not confined by the fever. They likewi&s;e continued in &s;everal of my patients for many days after their recovery. This was the ca&s;e in particu|lar in Mrs Clymer, Mrs Palmer's &s;on William, and in a &s;on of Mr William Compton. In &s;ome there was a preternatural &s;lowne&s;s of the pul&s;e. It beat 44 &s;trokes in a minute in Mr B. W. Morris&mdash;48 in Mr Thomas Wharton, Jun. and 64 in Mr William

San&s;om, at a time when they were in the mo&s;t im|minent danger. Dr Phy&s;ic informed me, that in one of his patients the pul&s;e was reduced in fre|quency to 30 &s;trokes in a minute. All the&s;e different &s;tates of the pul&s;e have been taken notice of by authors who have de&s;cribed pe&s;tilential fe|vers.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Verga&s;ca, Sorbait, and Boate in Haller's Biliotheca Me|dicinae, Vol. III. al&s;o by Dr Stubbs in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, and Riverius in his treati&s;e de febre pe&s;tilenti.</NOTE> They have been improperly a&s;cribed to the ab&s;ence of fever: I would rather &s;uppo&s;e that they are occa&s;ioned by the &s;timulus of the conta|gion, acting upon the arteries with too much force to admit of their being excited into quick and con|vul&s;ive motions. The remedy which removed it (to be mentioned hereafter) will render this expla|nation of its cau&s;e &s;till more probable. Milton de&s;cribes a darkne&s;s, from an exce&s;s of light. In like manner, we ob&s;erve in this &s;mall intermitting and &s;low pul&s;e, a deficiency of &s;trength from an exce&s;s of force applied to it. In every ca&s;e of it which came under my notice, it was likewi&s;e ten&s;e or chorded. This &s;pecies of pul&s;e occurred chief|ly in the month of Augu&s;t, and in the fir&s;t ten days in September. I had met with it former|ly in a &s;poradic ca&s;e of yellow fever. It was new to all my pupils. One of them, Mr Wa&s;h|ington,
<PB N="42" REF="027658_0049_0FD7CAC2E9071CE0">
gave it the name of the "undi&s;cribable pul&s;e." It aided in determining the &s;pecific na|ture of this fever before the common bilious re|mittent di&s;appeared in the city. For a while, I a&s;cribed this peculiarity in the pul&s;e, more e&s;peci|ally its <HI>&s;lowne&s;s,</HI> to an affection of the brain only, and &s;u&s;pected that it was produced, by what I have taken the liberty el&s;ewhere to call the <HI>phrenicula,</HI> or inflammatory &s;tate of the internal drop&s;y of the brain, and which I have remarked to be an occa|&s;ional &s;ymptom and con&s;equence of remitting fe|ver.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Medical Inquiries and Ob&s;ervations, Vol. II.</NOTE> I was the more di&s;po&s;ed to adopt this opi|nion, from perceiving this &s;low and intermitting pul&s;e more frequently in children than in adults. Impre&s;&s;ed with this idea, I reque&s;ted Mr Coxe, one of my pupils, to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in examining the &s;tate of the eye. For two days we di&s;covered no change in it, but on the third day after we began to in|&s;pect the eyes, we both perceived a preternatural dilatation of the pupils in different patients; and we &s;eldom afterwards &s;aw an eye in which it was ab&s;ent. In Dr Say it was attended by a &s;quinting, a &s;ymptom which marks a high degree of a mor|bid affection of the brain. Had this &s;lowne&s;s or intermi&s;&s;ion in the pul&s;e occurred only after &s;igns of inflammation or conge&s;tion had appeared in the

brain, I &s;hould have &s;uppo&s;ed that it had been de|rived wholly from that cau&s;e; but I well recollect having felt it &s;everal days before I could di&s;cover the lea&s;t change in the pupil of the eye. I am for|ced therefore to call in the operation of another cau&s;e, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in accounting for this &s;tate of the pul&s;e, and this I take to be a &s;pa&s;modic affection, accompanied with preternatural dilatation or con|traction of the heart.

"A ca&s;e (&s;ays my young corre&s;pondent) where a remarkable intermi&s;&s;ion of pul&s;e was ob|&s;erved, occurred in this city la&s;t year. A gentle|man of the medical profe&s;&s;ion, middle aged, of a de|licate habit of body, and who had formerly &s;uffer|ed
<PB N="44" REF="027658_0051_0FD7CAC7982E7DA0">
phthi&s;ical attacks, was attacked with the acute rheumati&s;m. Some days after he was taken ill, he complained of uncommon fulne&s;s, and a very peculiar kind of &s;en&s;ation about the praecordia, which it was judged proper to relieve by copious blood-letting. This being done, the unea&s;ine&s;s went off. It returned however three or four times, and was as often relieved by bleeding. During each of his fits (if I may call them &s;o), the pa|tient experienced an almo&s;t total remi&s;&s;ion of his pains in his limbs; but they returned with equal or greater violence after blood-letting. During the fit there was an intermi&s;&s;ion of the pul&s;e (the fir&s;t time) of no le&s;s than thirteen &s;trokes. It was when beating full, &s;trong, and &s;low. The third intermi&s;&s;ion was of nine &s;trokes. The gentleman &s;oon recovered, and has enjoyed good health for ten months pa&s;t. The opinion of &s;ome of his phy|&s;icians was, that the heart was affected as a mu&s;|cle, by the rheumati&s;m, and alternated with the limbs."</P>
<P>I am the more inclined to believe the peculia|rity in the pul&s;e which has been mentioned in the yellow fever, aro&s;e in part from a &s;pa&s;modic affec|tion of the heart, from the frequency of an uncom|mon palpitation of this mu&s;cle, which I di&s;covered in this di&s;order, more e&s;pecially in old people.
<PB N="45" REF="027658_0052_0FD7CACB6A8BA5B8">
The di&s;po&s;ition likewi&s;e to &s;yncope and &s;ighing, which &s;o often occurred, can be explained upon no other principle than inflammation, &s;pa&s;m, dilata|tion, or conge&s;tion in the heart. After the 10th of September this unde&s;cribable or <HI>&s;ulky</HI> pul&s;e (for by the latter epithet I &s;ometimes called it) became le&s;s ob&s;ervable: and in proportion as the weather became cool, it totally di&s;appeared. It was gradually &s;ucceeded by a pul&s;e, full, ten&s;e, quick, and as fre|quent as in pleuri&s;y or rheumati&s;m. It differed how|ever from a pleuritic or rheumatic pul&s;e, in impar|ting a very different &s;en&s;ation to the fingers. No two &s;trokes &s;eemed to be exactly alike. Its ac|tion was of a hobbling nature. It was at this time &s;o familiar to me, that I think I could have di&s;tin|gui&s;hed the di&s;ea&s;e by it, without &s;eeing the pati|ent. It was remarkable, that this pul&s;e attended the yellow fever even when it appeared in the mild form of an intermittent, and in tho&s;e ca&s;es where the patients were able to walk about, or go a|broad. It was nearly as <HI>ten&s;e</HI> in the remi&s;&s;ions and intermi&s;&s;ions of the fever, as it was in the ex|acerbations. It was an alarming &s;ymptom, and when the only remedy which was effectual to re|move it, was neglected, &s;uch a change in the &s;y&s;|tem was induced, as frequently brought on death in a few days.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="027658_0053_0FD7CACD36D35AC8">
This change in the pul&s;e, from extreme low|ne&s;s, to fulne&s;s and activity, appeared to be owing to the diminution of the heat of the weather, which by its &s;timulus, added to that of the con|tagion, had induced tho&s;e &s;ymptoms of indirect debility in the pul&s;e, which have been mentioned.</P>
<P>The pul&s;e mo&s;t frequently le&s;&s;ened in its ful|ne&s;s, and became gradually weak, frequent, and imperceptible before death, but I met with &s;everal ca&s;es in which it was full, active, and even ten&s;e in the la&s;t hours of life.</P>
<P>HEMORRHAGIES belong to the &s;ymptoms of this fever as they appeared in the &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;|tem. They occurred in the beginning of the di&s;|order chiefly from the no&s;e and uterus. Some|times but a few drops of blood di&s;tilled from the no&s;e. The men&s;es were unu&s;ual in their quantity, when they appeared at their &s;tated periods, but they often came on a week or two before the u&s;ual time of their appearance. I &s;aw one ca&s;e of an hemorrhage from the lungs on the fir&s;t day of the fever, which was mi&s;taken for a common hemop|ty&s;is. As the di&s;ea&s;e advanced, the di&s;charges of blood became more univer&s;al. They occurred from the gums, ears, &s;tomach, bowels, and urinary pa&s;|&s;ages. Drops of blood i&s;&s;ued from the inner Can|thus

of the left eye of Mr Jo&s;iah Coates. Dr Wood|hou&s;e attended a lady who bled from the holes in her ears, which had been made by ear rings. Many bled from the orifices which had been made by bleeding, &s;everal days after they appeared to have been healed, and &s;ome from wounds which had been made in veins in un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts to draw blood. The&s;e la&s;t hemorrhages were very trouble&s;ome, and in &s;ome ca&s;es precipitated death.</P>
<P>II. I come now to mention the &s;ymptoms of this fever as they appeared in the LIVER, the LUNGS, and the BRAIN. From the hi&s;tories which I had read of this di&s;order, I was early led to ex|amine the &s;tate of the LIVER, but I was &s;urpri&s;ed to find &s;o few marks of hepatic affection. I met with but two ca&s;es in which the patient could lie only on the right &s;ide. Many complained of a dull pain in the region of the liver, but very few complained of that &s;orene&s;s to the touch, about the pit of the &s;tomach which is taken notice of by authors, and which was univer&s;al in the yellow fever in 1762. In proportion as the cool weather advanced, a preternatural determination of the blood took place chiefly to the lungs and brain. Many were affected with pneumonic &s;ymptoms,
<PB N="48" REF="027658_0055_0FD7CAD226A70500">
and &s;ome appeared to die of &s;udden effu&s;ions of blood or &s;erum in the lungs. It was an unex|pected effu&s;ion of this kind which put an end to the life of Mrs Keppele after &s;he had exhibited hopeful &s;igns of a recovery.</P>
<P>I &s;aw one per&s;on who recovered from an affection of the lungs, by means of a copious expectoration of yellow phlegm and mucus. But the BRAIN was principally affected with morbid conge&s;tion in this di&s;order. It was indicated by the &s;uffu&s;ion of blood in the face, by the redne&s;s of the eyes, by a dila|tation of the pupils, by the pain in the head, by the hemorrhagies from the no&s;e and ears, by the &s;ickne&s;s, or vomiting, and by an almo&s;t univer&s;al co&s;tive &s;tate of the bowels. I wi&s;h to impre&s;s the reader with the&s;e facts, for they formed one of the &s;tronge&s;t indications for the u&s;e of the remedies which I adopted for the cure of this di&s;order. It is difficult to determine the exact &s;tate of the&s;e vi&s;cera in every ca&s;e of bilious and yellow fever. Inflammation certainly takes place in &s;ome ca&s;es, and internal hemorrhagies in others; but I believe the mo&s;t frequent affection of the&s;e vi&s;cera con&s;i&s;ts in a certain morbid accumulation of blood in them, which has been happily called by Dr Clark an <HI>engorgement</HI> or choaking of the blood ve&s;&s;els.

It is true the di&s;&s;ections of Dr Phy&s;ic and Dr Cathrall di&s;covered no morbid appearances in either of the vi&s;cera which have been mentioned, but it &s;hould be remembered, that the&s;e di&s;&s;ections were made early in the di&s;order. Dr Annan attended the di&s;&s;ection of a brain of a patient who died at Bu&s;h-hill &s;ome days afterwards, and ob&s;erved the blood ve&s;&s;els to be unu&s;ually turgid. In tho&s;e ca&s;es where con|ge&s;tion only takes place, it is as ea&s;y to conceive that all morbid appearances in the brain may cea&s;e after death, as that the &s;uffu&s;ion of blood in the face &s;hould di&s;appear after the retreat of the blood from the extremities of the ve&s;&s;els in the la&s;t mo|ments of life. It is no new thing for morbid affections of the brain to leave either &s;lender or no marks of di&s;ea&s;e after death. Dr Quin has given a di&s;&s;ection of the brain of a child that died with all the &s;ymptoms of hydrocephalus inter|nus, and yet nothing was di&s;covered in the brain but a &s;light turge&s;cence of its blood ve&s;&s;els.

III. The STOMACH and BOWELS Were affected in many ways in this fever. The di&s;ea&s;e &s;eldom appeared without nau&s;ea or vomiting. In &s;ome ca&s;es, they both occurred for &s;everal days, or a week before they were accompanied by any fever. This was more frequently the ca&s;e, where the di&s;|ea&s;e was taken by exhalation from the putrid coffee, than by contagion. Sometimes a pain, known by the name of ga&s;trodynia, u&s;hered in the di&s;ea&s;e. The &s;tomach was &s;o extremely irritable as to reject drinks of every kind. Sometimes green or yellow bile was rejected on the fir&s;t day of the di&s;order, by vomiting; but I much oftener &s;aw it continue for two days without di&s;charging any thing from the &s;tomach, but the drinks which were taken by the patient. If the fever in any ca&s;e came on without vomiting, or if it had been checked by remedies that were ineffectual, to remove it altogether, it generally appeared, or returned, on the 4th or 5th day of the di&s;order. I dreaded this &s;ymptom on tho&s;e days, for although it was not always the forerun|ner of death, yet it generally rendered the reco|very more difficult and tedious. In &s;ome ca&s;es the vomiting was more or le&s;s con&s;tant from the be|ginning to the end of the di&s;order, whether it ter|minated in life or death.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="027658_0059_0FD7CADA0D698C48">
The vomiting which came on about the 4th or 5th day, was accompanied with a burning pain in the region of the &s;tomach. It produced great anxiety and to&s;&s;ing of the body from one part of the bed to another. In &s;ome ca&s;es this painful burning occurred before any vomiting had taken place. Drinks were now rejected from the &s;tomach &s;o &s;uddenly as often to be di&s;charged over the hand that lifted them to the head of the patient. The contents of the &s;tomach (to be mentioned here|after) were &s;ometimes thrown up with a convul&s;ive motion, that propelled them in a &s;tream to a great di&s;tance, and in &s;ome ca&s;es all over the clothes of the by-&s;tanders.</P>
<P>Flatulency was an almo&s;t univer&s;al &s;ymptom in every &s;tage of this di&s;order. It was very di&s;tre&s;|&s;ing in many ca&s;es. It occurred chiefly in the &s;to|mach.</P>
<P>The BOWELS were generally co&s;tive, and in &s;ome patients, as ob&s;tinately &s;o, as in the dry gripes. In &s;ome ca&s;es there was all the pain and di&s;tre&s;s of a bilious colic, and in others, the tene&s;|mus, and mucous and bloody di&s;charges of a true dy&s;entery. A diarrhoea introduced the di&s;ea&s;e in in a few per&s;ons, but it was chiefly in tho&s;e who had been previou&s;ly indi&s;po&s;ed with weak bowels.
<PB N="53" REF="027658_0060_0FD7CADB32CF37A8">
A painful ten&s;ion of the abdomen took place in many, accompanied in &s;ome in&s;tances by a dull, and in others, by an acute pain in the lower part of the belly.</P>
<P>The vomiting and co&s;tivene&s;s in the fir&s;t &s;tage of this fever, I believe were occa&s;ioned chiefly by the morbid &s;tate of the brain. But the vomiting and burning in the &s;tomach, and the pain in the bowels which occurred on the 4th and 5th days, appeared to be the effects of inflammation induced in part by the effu&s;ion of acrid bile into the alimentary canal, and in part by a change in the action of the coats of the &s;tomach and bowels, induced by effu|&s;ions of &s;erum or red blood, &s;imilar to tho&s;e which take place on the &s;kin in malignant fevers, and which are known by the name of petechiae. I am the more di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;cribe a large portion of the inflammation, ero&s;ions, and mortifications, which have been ob&s;erved after death in the &s;tomach and bowels in this fever, to the latter cau&s;e, from the di&s;covery which has been made of petechiae and carbuncles in the bowels in the plague, exactly &s;imi|lar to tho&s;e which are found on the external parts of the body in that di&s;order<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haller's Biliotheca Medicinae, vol. iv. p. 375.</NOTE>.</P>

IV. I come now to de&s;cribe the &s;tate of the SECRETIONS and EXCRETIONS, as they appeared in different &s;tages of this fever.</P>
<P>There appeared to be a preternatural &s;ecretion and excretion of bile. It was di&s;charged from the &s;tomach and bowels in large quantities, and of very different qualities and colours.</P>
<P N="1">1. On the fir&s;t and &s;econd days of the di&s;order, many patients puked from half a pint to nearly a quart of green or yellow bile. Four ca&s;es came under my notice in which black bile was di&s;|charged on the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> day. Three of the&s;e patients recovered. I a&s;cribed their recovery, to the bile not having as yet acquired acrimony enough to in|flame, or-corrode the &s;tomach.</P>
<P N="2">2. There was frequently on the 4th or 5th day, a di&s;charge of matter from the &s;tomach, re&s;embling coffee impregnated with its grounds. This was always an alarming &s;ymptom. I believed it at fir&s;t to be a modification of vitiated bile, but I was led afterwards by its re&s;emblance to the urine (to be de&s;cribed hereafter) to &s;u&s;pect that it was pro|duced by a morbid &s;ecretion in the liver, and ef|fu&s;ed from it into the &s;tomach. Many recovered who di&s;charged this coffee-coloured matter.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="55" REF="027658_0062_0FD7CAE24A5B3308">
3. Towards the clo&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, there was a di&s;charge of matter of a deep or pale black colour, from the &s;tomach. Flakey &s;ub&s;tances frequent|ly floated in the ba&s;on or chamber-pot upon the &s;urface of this matter. It appeared to be bile in a highly acrid &s;tate. That the bile may become ex|tremely acrid in this &s;tage of the di&s;order is evident from &s;everal ob&s;ervations and experiments. Dr Phy&s;ic's hand was inflamed in con&s;equence of its being wetted by bile in this &s;tate, in di&s;&s;ecting a dead body. Dr Arthaud examined the body of a &s;oldier who died of the yellow fever at the French Cape on the 16th of May 1789, who&s;e bile im|parted a green colour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ro&s;ier's Journal for Jan. 1790. vol. xxxvi. p. 380.</NOTE>, to the tincture of radi&s;hes. I am not certain that the black matter, which was di&s;charged in the la&s;t &s;tage of this di&s;order, was al|ways vitiated or acrid bile. It was probably in &s;ome ca&s;es, the matter which was formed in con|&s;equence of the mortification of the &s;tomach. The matter which was di&s;charged from carbuncles on the &s;kin, as I &s;hall &s;ay hereafter, was always of a dark colour. Several di&s;&s;ections of per&s;ons who have died of the yellow fever, have &s;hewn ab&s;ce&s;&s;es in the &s;tomach, not unlike external carbuncles. May not the black matter in &s;ome ca&s;es be derived from the&s;e internal carbuncle-like ab&s;ce&s;&s;es?</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="56" REF="027658_0063_0FD7CAE400449698">
4. There was frequently di&s;charged from the &s;tomach in the clo&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, a large quan|tity of grumous blood, which exhibited a dark co|lour on its out&s;ide, re&s;embling that of &s;ome of the matters which have been de&s;cribed, and which I believe was frequently mi&s;taken for what is com|monly known by the name of the <HI>black vomiting.</HI> Several of my patients did me the honour to &s;ay, I had cured them, after that &s;ymptom of approaching di&s;&s;olution had made its appear|ance; but I am inclined to believe, dark-coloured blood only, or the coffee coloured matter, was mi&s;taken for the matters which con&s;titute the fatal black vomiting. I except here the black di&s;charge before mentioned, which took place in three ca&s;es on the fir&s;t day of the di&s;order. This I have no doubt was bile, but it had not acquired its greate&s;t acrimony, and it was di&s;|charged before mortification, or even inflamma|tion could have taken place in the &s;tomach. Se|veral per&s;ons died without a black vomiting of any kind.</P>
<P>Along with all the di&s;charges from the &s;tomach which have been de&s;cribed, there was occa&s;ionally a large worm, and frequently large quantities of mucus and tough phlegm.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="027658_0064_0FD7CAE547D664B8">
The colour, quality, and quantity of the <HI>faeces</HI> depended very much upon the treatment of the di&s;ea&s;e. Where active purges had been given, the &s;tools were copious, foetid, and of a black or dark colour. Where they were &s;pontaneous, or excited by weak purges, they had a more natural ap|pearance. In both ca&s;es, they were &s;ometimes of a green, and &s;ometimes of an olive colour. Their &s;mell was more or le&s;s foetid, according to the time in which they had been detained in the bowels. I vi&s;ited a lady who had pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal days with|out a &s;tool, and who had been treated with tonic remedies. I gave her a purge, which in a few hours procured a di&s;charge of faeces &s;o ex|tremely foetid, that they produced fainting in an old woman who attended her. The acrimony of the faeces was &s;uch as to excoriate the rectum, and &s;ometimes to produce an exten&s;ive inflammation all around its external termination. The quantity of the &s;tools produced by a &s;ingle purge was in many ca&s;es very great. They could be accounted for only by calling in the con&s;tant, and rapid formation of them, by preternatural effu&s;ions of bile into the bowels.</P>
<P>I attended one per&s;on, and heard of two others, in whom the &s;tools were as white as in the jaun|dice. I &s;u&s;pected in the&s;e ca&s;es, the bile was &s;o
<PB N="58" REF="027658_0065_0FD7C79E273C7AB8">
impacted in the gall bladder, or in its ducts, as not to be di&s;charged in a &s;ufficient quantity to co|lour the foeces. Large round worms were fre|quently di&s;charged with the &s;tools.</P>
<P>The <HI>urine</HI> was in &s;ome ca&s;es plentiful, and of a high colour. It was at times clear, and at other times turbid. About the 4th or 5th day it &s;ome|times a&s;&s;umed a dark colour, and re&s;embled &s;trong coffee. This colour continued in one in&s;tance for &s;everal days after the patient recovered. In &s;ome, the di&s;charge was accompanied by a burning pain re&s;embling that which takes place in a gonorrhoea. I met with one ca&s;e in which this burning came on only in the evening, with the exacerbation of the fever, and went off with its remi&s;&s;ion in the morning.</P>
<P>A total deficiency of the urine took place in many people for a day or two, without pain. Dr Sydenham takes notice of the &s;ame &s;ymptom in the highly inflammatory &s;mall pox.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wallis's Edition, Vol. i. p. 197.</NOTE> It general|ly accompanied, or portended great danger. I &s;u&s;pected that it was connected in this di&s;ea&s;e, as in the hydrocephalus internus, with a morbid &s;tate of the brain. I heard of one ca&s;e in which there
<PB N="59" REF="027658_0066_0FD7CAE6C82E0650">
was a <HI>&s;uppre&s;&s;ion</HI> of urine, which could not be re|lieved without the u&s;e of the catheter.</P>
<P>A young man was attended by Mr Fi&s;her, one of my pupils, who di&s;charged &s;everal quarts of limpid urine ju&s;t before he died.</P>
<P>Dr Arthaud informs us in the hi&s;tory of the di&s;&s;ection before quoted, that the urine after death imparted a green colour to the tincture of radi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Many people were relieved by copious <HI>&s;weats</HI> on the fir&s;t day of the di&s;order. They were in &s;ome in&s;tances &s;pontaneous, and in others, they were excited by diluting drinks, or by &s;trong purges. The&s;e &s;weats were often of a yellow co|lour, and &s;ometimes had an offen&s;ive &s;mell. They were in &s;ome ca&s;es cold, and attended at the &s;ame time with a full pul&s;e. In general, the &s;kin was dry in the beginning as well as in the &s;ub&s;equent &s;tages of the di&s;order. I &s;aw but few in&s;tances of the di&s;ea&s;e terminating like common fevers, by &s;weat after the third day. I wi&s;h this fact to be remembered by the reader, for it laid part of the foundation of my method of curing this fever.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="027658_0067_0FD7CAE9270FA240">
There was in &s;ome ca&s;es a preternatural &s;ecre|tion and excretion of <HI>mucus</HI> from the glands of the throat. It was di&s;charged by an almo&s;t con|&s;tant hawking and &s;pitting. All who had this &s;ymptom recovered.</P>
<P>The TONGUE was in every ca&s;e moi&s;t, and of a white colour on the fir&s;t and &s;econd days of the fever. As the di&s;ea&s;e advanced, it a&s;|&s;umed a red colour, and a &s;mooth &s;hining ap|pearance. It was not quite dry in this &s;tate Towards the clo&s;e of the fever, a dry black &s;treak appeared in its middle, which gradu|ally extended to every part of it. Few reco|vered after this appearance on the tongue took place.</P>
<P>V. In the NERVOUS SYSTEM the &s;ymptoms of the fever were different according as it affected the brain&mdash;the mu&s;cles&mdash;the nerves&mdash;or the mind. The &s;udden and violent action of the contagion, induced apoplexy in &s;everal people. In &s;ome, it brought on &s;yncope, and in others, convul&s;ions in every part of the body. The apoplectic ca&s;es generally proved fatal, for they fell chiefly upon hard drinkers. Per&s;ons affected by &s;yncope, or convul&s;ions, &s;ometimes fell down in the &s;treets. Two ca&s;es of this kind happened near my hou&s;e.
<PB N="61" REF="027658_0068_0FD7CAEAA84CC1D8">
One of them came under my notice. He was &s;uppo&s;ed by the bye-&s;tanders to be drunken, but his countenance, and convul&s;ive motions, &s;oon convinced me that this was not the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>A coma was ob&s;erved in &s;ome people, or an ob&s;tinate wakefulne&s;s in every &s;tage of the di&s;or|der. The latter &s;ymptom mo&s;t frequently attended the convale&s;cence. Many were affected with im|mobility, or numbne&s;s in their limbs.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ymptoms were con&s;tant, or temporary, according to the nature of the remedies which were made u&s;e of, to remove them. They ex|tended to all the limbs, in &s;ome ca&s;es, and only to a part of them in others. In &s;ome, a violent cramp both in the arms, and legs attended the fir&s;t attack of the fever. I met with one ca&s;e in which there was a difficulty of &s;wallowing from a &s;pa&s;modic affection of the throat, &s;uch as occurs in the locked-jaw.</P>
<P>A hiccup attended the la&s;t &s;tage of this di&s;or|der, but I think le&s;s frequently than the la&s;t &s;tage of the common bilious fever. I &s;aw only five ca&s;es of recovery where this &s;ymptom took place.</P>
<P>There was in &s;ome in&s;tances a deficiency of &s;en|&s;ibility, but in others a degree of it, extending to
<PB N="62" REF="027658_0069_0FD7C79FA7FFF5B0">
every part of the body, which rendered the appli|cation of common rum to the &s;kin, and even the lea&s;t motion of the limbs painful.</P>
<P>I was &s;urpri&s;ed to ob&s;erve the la&s;t &s;tage of this fever to exhibit &s;o few of the &s;ymptoms of the common typhus or nervous fever. Tremors of the limbs and twitchings of the tendons were un|common. They occurred only in tho&s;e ca&s;es in which there was a predi&s;po&s;ition to nervous di&s;|ea&s;es, and chiefly in the convale&s;cent &s;tate of the di&s;order.</P>
<P>While the mu&s;cles and nerves in many ca&s;es ex|hibited &s;o many marks of preternatural weak|ne&s;s, in &s;ome, they appeared to be affected with preternatural excitement. Hence patients in the clo&s;e of the di&s;order often ro&s;e from their beds, walked acro&s;s their rooms, or came down &s;tairs, with as much ea&s;e as if they had been in perfect health. I lo&s;t a patient in whom this &s;tate of mor|bid &s;trength occurred to &s;uch a degree, that he &s;tood up before his gla&s;s, and &s;haved him&s;elf on the day in which he died.</P>
<P>The mind &s;uffered with the morbid &s;tates of the brain and nerves. A delirium was a common &s;ymptom. It alternated in &s;ome ca&s;es with the exacerbations and remi&s;&s;ions of the fever. In
<PB N="63" REF="027658_0070_0FD7CAEB9BEAFCE8">
&s;ome, it continued without a remi&s;&s;ion, until a few hours before death. Many, however, pa&s;&s;ed through the whole cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e without the lea&s;t derangement in their ideas, even where there were evident &s;igns of a morbid conge&s;tion in the brain. Some were &s;eized with maniacal &s;ymptoms. In the&s;e, there was an apparent ab|&s;ence of fever. Such was the degree of this ma|nia in one man, that he &s;tripped of his &s;hirt, left his bed, and ran through the &s;treets with no other covering than a napkin on his head, at 8 o'clock at night, to the great terror of all who met him. The &s;ymptoms of mania occurred mo&s;t frequently towards the clo&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, and &s;ometimes continued for many days, and weeks, after all the febrile &s;ymptoms had di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>The temper was much affected in this fever. There were few, in whom it did not produce great depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits. This was the ca&s;e in many, in whom pious habits had &s;ubdued the fear of death. In &s;ome the temper became very irritable. Two ca&s;es of this kind came under my notice, in per&s;ons who in good health, were di&s;tingui&s;hed for uncommon &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition and man|ners.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved in &s;everal per&s;ons the operations of the under&s;tanding to be unimpaired, throughout
<PB N="64" REF="027658_0071_0FD7CAEE1B163440">
the whole cour&s;e of the fever, who retained no remembrance of any thing that pa&s;&s;ed in their &s;ickne&s;s. My pupil Mr Fi&s;her furni&s;hed a remark|able example of this correctne&s;s of under&s;tanding with a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of memory. He neither &s;aid, nor did any thing during his illne&s;s, that indicated the lea&s;t derangement of mind, and yet he recol|lected nothing that pa&s;&s;ed in his room, except my vi&s;its to him. His memory awakened upon my taking him by the hand on the morning of the 6th day of his di&s;order, and congratulating him upon his e&s;cape from the grave.</P>
<P>In &s;ome, there was a weakne&s;s, or total defect of memory for &s;everal weeks after their recovery. Dr Woodhou&s;e informed me that he had met with a woman who after &s;he had recovered, could not recollect her own name.</P>
<P>Perhaps it would be proper to rank that &s;elf-deception with re&s;pect to the nature and danger of the di&s;ea&s;e which was &s;o univer&s;al, among the in&s;tances of derangement of mind.</P>
<P>The pain which attended the di&s;order was dif|ferent according as the &s;y&s;tem was affected by direct or indirect debility. In tho&s;e ca&s;es in which the &s;y&s;tem &s;unk under the violent impre&s;&s;ion of the contagion, there was little or no pain. In
<PB N="65" REF="027658_0072_0FD7C7A880298100">
proportion as the &s;y&s;tem was relieved from this oppre&s;&s;ion it recovered its &s;en&s;ibility. The pain in the head, was acute and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. It affected the eye balls in a peculiar manner. A pain ex|tended in &s;ome ca&s;es from the back of the head, down the neck. The ears were affected in &s;everal per&s;ons with a painful &s;en&s;ation, which they com|pared to a &s;tring drawing their two ears together through the brain. The &s;ides, and the regions of the &s;tomach, liver and bowels, were all, in differ|ent people, the &s;cats of either dull or acute pains. The &s;tomach towards the clo&s;e of the di&s;order was affected with a burning or &s;pa&s;modic pain of the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing nature. It produced in &s;ome ca&s;es great angui&s;h of body and mind. In others it pro|duced cries and &s;hrieks which were often heard on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the &s;treets to where the patients lay. The back &s;uffered very much in this di&s;order. The &s;toute&s;t men complained, and even groaned un|der it. An acute pain extended in &s;ome ca&s;es from the back, to one or both thighs. The arms and legs &s;ympathized with every other part of the body. One of my patients, upon who&s;e limbs the di&s;ea&s;e fell, with its principal force, &s;aid that his legs felt as if they had been &s;craped with a &s;harp in&s;tru|ment. The &s;ympathy of friends with the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the &s;ick, extended to a &s;mall part of their mi&s;ery, when it did not include their &s;ufferings from pain.

One of the deare&s;t friends I ever lo&s;t by death, declared in the height of her illne&s;s, that "no one knew the pains of a yellow fever, but tho&s;e who felt them."</P>
<P>VI. The <HI>&s;en&s;es</HI> and <HI>appetites</HI> exhibited &s;everal marks of the univer&s;al ravages of this fever upon the body. A deafne&s;s attended in many ca&s;es, but it was not often as in the nervous fever, a favourable &s;ymptom. A dimne&s;s of &s;ight, was very common in the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e. Many were affected with temporary blindne&s;s. In &s;ome there was a lo&s;s of &s;ight in con&s;equence of gutta &s;erena, or a total de&s;truction of the &s;ub&s;tance of the eye. There was in many per&s;ons a &s;orene&s;s to the touch, which extended all over the body. I have often ob&s;erved this &s;ymptom to be the fore|runner of a favourable i&s;&s;ue of a nervous fever, but it was le&s;s frequently the ca&s;e in this di&s;order.</P>
<P>The <HI>thir&s;t</HI> was moderate or ab&s;ent in &s;ome ca&s;es, but it occurred in the greate&s;t number of per&s;ons whom I &s;aw in this fever. Sometimes it was very inten&s;e. One of my patients who &s;uf|fered by an exce&s;&s;ive draught of cold water, de|clared ju&s;t before he died, that "he could drink up the Delaware." It was always an alarming &s;ymptom, when this thir&s;t came on in this extra|vagant
<PB N="67" REF="027658_0074_0FD7CAF5C7889E90">
degree in the la&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;order. In the beginning of the fever, it generally abated upon the appearance of a moi&s;t &s;kin. Water, was preferred to all other drinks.</P>
<P>The <HI>appetite</HI> for food was impaired in this, as in all other fevers, but it returned much &s;ooner than is common after the patient began to recover. Coffee was reli&s;hed in the remi&s;&s;ions of the fever, in every &s;tage of the di&s;order. So keen was the appetite for &s;olid, and more e&s;pecially for animal food, after the &s;olution of the fever, that many &s;uffered from eating aliment that was improper from its quality or quantity. There was a general di&s;reli&s;h for wine, but malt liquors were frequently grateful to the appetite.</P>
<P>Many people retained a reli&s;h for tobacco much longer after they were attacked by this fever, and acquired a reli&s;h for it much &s;ooner after they began to recover, than are common in any other febrile di&s;ea&s;e. I met with one ca&s;e in which my patient, who was &s;o ill as to require two bleedings, continued to chew tobacco through every &s;tage of his fever.</P>
<P>The convale&s;cence from this di&s;order was mark|ed in &s;ome in&s;tances, by a &s;udden revival of the
<PB N="68" REF="027658_0075_0FD7CAF716FDE128">
venereal appetite. Several weddings took place in the city between per&s;ons who had recovered from the fever. Twelve took place among the con|vale&s;cents in the ho&s;pital at Bu&s;h-hill. I wi&s;h I could add, that the pa&s;&s;ion of the &s;exes for each other, among tho&s;e &s;ubjects of public charity, was always gratified only in a lawful way. Delicacy forbids a detail of the &s;cenes of debauchery which were practi&s;ed near the ho&s;pital in &s;ome of the tents, which had been appropriated for the recep|tion of convale&s;cents. It is not peculiar to the yellow fever to produce this morbid excitability of the venereal appetite. It was produced in a much higher degree by the plague which raged in Me&s;&s;ina in the year 1743.</P>
<P>VII. The <HI>lymphatic</HI> and <HI>glandular &s;y&s;tem</HI> did not e&s;cape without &s;ome &s;igns of the infection of this di&s;ea&s;e. I met with three ca&s;es of &s;wellings in the inguinal, two in the parotid, and one in the cervical glands: all the&s;e patients recovered without a &s;uppuration of their &s;wellings. They were ex|tremely painful in one ca&s;e in which no redne&s;s or inflammation appeared. In the others, there was con&s;iderable inflammation, and but little pain.</P>
<P>In one of the ca&s;es of inguinal buboes, the whole force of the di&s;ea&s;e &s;eemed to be collected into the
<PB N="69" REF="027658_0076_0FD7CAF8A7BE2608">
lymphatic &s;y&s;tem. The patient walked about, and had no fever nor pain in any part of his body, except in his groin. In another ca&s;e which came under my care, a &s;welling and pain extended from the groin along the &s;permatic cord into one of the te&s;ticles. The&s;e glandular &s;wellings were not pe|culiar to our late epidemic. They occurred in the yellow fever of Jamaica as de&s;cribed by Dr Williams, and always with a happy i&s;&s;ue of the di&s;order<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay on the Bilious or Yellow Fever, p. 35.</NOTE>. A &s;imilar concentration of the con|tagion of the plague in the lymphatic glands, is taken notice of by Dr Patrick Ru&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>VIII. The SKIN exhibited many marks of this fever. It was preternaturally warm in &s;ome ca&s;es, but it was often preternaturally cool. In &s;ome there was a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing coldne&s;s in the limbs for two or three days. The yellow colour from which this fever has derived its name, was not univer&s;al. It &s;eldom appeared where purges had been given in &s;ufficient do&s;es. The yellowne&s;s rarely appear|ed before the third, and generally about the fifth or &s;eventh day of the fever. Its early appearance always denoted great danger. It &s;ometimes appear|ed fir&s;t on the neck and brea&s;t, in&s;tead of the eyes. In one of my patients it di&s;covered it&s;elf fir&s;t be|hind
<PB N="70" REF="027658_0077_0FD7C7A9672AFA40">
one of his ears, and on the crown of his head, which had been bald for &s;everal years. The re|mi&s;&s;ions and exacerbations of the fever &s;eemed to have an influence upon this colour, for it appeared and di&s;appeared altogether, or with fainter or deep|er &s;hades of yellow, two or three times in the cour&s;e of the di&s;order. The eyes &s;eldom e&s;caped a yellow tinge; and yet I &s;aw a number of ca&s;es in which the di&s;ea&s;e appeared with uncommon ma|lignity and danger, without the pre&s;ence of this &s;ymptom. Two very different cau&s;es have been &s;uppo&s;ed to produce this yellow colour of the &s;kin. By &s;ome it has been attributed to the di&s;&s;olution of the blood; but I &s;hall &s;ay hereafter, that the blood was &s;eldom di&s;&s;olved in this fever. The yel|low colour, moreover, occurred in tho&s;e ca&s;es where the blood exhibited an inflammatory cru&s;t, and it continued in many per&s;ons for five or &s;ix weeks after their recovery. From the&s;e facts it is evi|dent, that the yellowne&s;s was in all ca&s;es the effect of an ab&s;orption and mixture of bile with the blood.</P>
<P>There was a clay-coloured appearance in the face in &s;ome ca&s;es, which was very different from the yellow colour which has been de&s;cribed. It occurred in the la&s;t &s;tage of the fever, and in no in&s;tance did I &s;ee a recovery after it.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="027658_0078_0FD7CAFB3A81C880">
There were eruptions of various kinds on the &s;kin, each of which I &s;hall briefly de&s;cribe.</P>
<P N="1">1. I met with two ca&s;es of an eruption on the &s;kin, re&s;embling that which occurs in the &s;carlet fever. Dr Hume &s;ays, pimples often appear on the pit of the &s;tomach in the yellow fever of Ja|maica. I examined the external region of the &s;to|mach in many of my patients, without di&s;covering this &s;ymptom.</P>
<P N="2">2. I met with one ca&s;e, in which there was an eruption of watery bli&s;ters, which after bur&s;ting, ended in deep, black &s;ores.</P>
<P N="3">3. There was an eruption about the mouth in many people, which ended in &s;cabs, &s;imilar to tho&s;e which take place in the common bilious fe|ver. They always afforded a pro&s;pect of a favour|able i&s;&s;ue of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P N="4">4. Many per&s;ons had eruptions which re&s;em|bled mo&s;chetto bites. They were red and circum|&s;cribed. They appeared chiefly on the arms, but they &s;ometimes extended to the brea&s;t. Like the yellow colour of the &s;kin, they appeared and di&s;|appeared two or three times in the cour&s;e of the di&s;order.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="72" REF="027658_0079_0FD7C7AFC6E56D38">
5. Petechiae were common in the latter &s;tage of the fever. They &s;ometimes came on in large, and at other times in &s;mall red blotches; but they &s;oon acquired a dark colour. In mo&s;t, ca&s;es they were the harbingers of death.</P>
<P N="6">6. Several ca&s;es of carbuncles, &s;uch as occur in the plague, came under my notice. They were large and hard &s;wellings on the limbs, with a black apex, which upon being opened, di&s;charged a thin, dark-coloured, bloody matter. From one of the&s;e malignant &s;ores, an hemorrhage took place, which precipitated the death of the amiable widow of Dr John Morris.</P>
<P N="7">7. A large and painful anthrax on the back &s;uc|ceeded a favourable i&s;&s;ue of the fever in the Rev. Dr Blackwell.</P>
<P N="8">8. I met with a woman who &s;hewed me the marks of a number of &s;mall boils on her face and neck, which accompanied her fever.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this di&s;po&s;ition to cutaneous eruptions in this di&s;order, it was remarkable that bli&s;ters were much le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to mortify than in the common nervous fever. I met with only one ca&s;e in which a deep-&s;eated ulcer followed the ap|plication
<PB N="73" REF="027658_0080_0FD7C7B0E7446DE0">
of bli&s;ters to the legs. Such was the in|&s;en&s;ibility of the &s;kin in &s;ome people, that bli&s;ters made no impre&s;&s;ion upon it.</P>
<P>IX. How far the <HI>blood</HI> may be con&s;idered as the vehicle of the contagion, it is not my bu&s;ine&s;s at pre&s;ent to inquire; nor &s;hall I in this place men|tion the different appearances it exhibited when drawn from a vein. It has been &s;uppo&s;ed to un|dergo a change from a healthy to a putrid &s;tate; and many of the &s;ymptoms of the fever which have been de&s;cribed, particularly the hemorrhagies and eruptions on the &s;kin, have been a&s;cribed to this &s;uppo&s;ed putrefaction of the blood. It would be ea&s;y to multiply arguments to prove, that no &s;uch thing as putrefaction can take place in the blood; and that the &s;ymptoms which have been &s;uppo&s;ed to prove its exi&s;tence, are all effects of a &s;udden, violent, and rapid inflammatory ac|tion, or pre&s;&s;ure upon the blood-ve&s;&s;els; and hence the external and internal hemorrhagies. The pe|techiae on the &s;urface of the &s;kin depend upon the &s;ame cau&s;e. They are nothing but effu&s;ions of &s;e|rum or red blood, from a rupture or preternatural dilatation of the capillary ve&s;&s;els<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Wallis's edition of Sydenham, Vol. I. p. 165. Vol. II. p. 52, 94, 98, 350. De Haen's Ratio Medendi, Vol. II. p. 162. Vol. IV. p. 172. Gaubii Pathologia &sect; 498, and Dr Sybert's inaugural di&s;&s;ertation, entitled "An at|tempt to Di&s;prove the doctrine of the Putrefaction of the Blood in Living Animals," publi&s;hed in Philadelphia in 1793.</NOTE>. The &s;mell
<PB N="74" REF="027658_0081_0FD7CAFE115BF840">
emitted from per&s;ons affected by this di&s;ea&s;e was far from being of a putrid nature; and if this had been the ca&s;e, it would not have proved the exi|&s;tence of putrefaction in the blood; for a putrid &s;mell is often di&s;charged from the lungs, and from the pores in &s;weat, which is wholly unconnected with a putrid, or perhaps any other morbid &s;tate of the blood. There are plants which di&s;charge an odor, which conveys to the no&s;e a &s;en&s;ation like that of putrefaction; and yet the&s;e plants exi&s;t at the &s;ame time, in a &s;tate of the mo&s;t healthy vege|tation: nor does the early putrid &s;mell of a body which peri&s;hes with this fever, prove a putrid change to have taken place in the blood before death. All animals which die &s;uddenly, and with|out lo&s;s of blood, are di&s;po&s;ed to a &s;peedy putre|faction. This has long been remarked in animals that have been killed after a chace, or by light|ning. The poi&s;onous air called <HI>&s;amiel,</HI> which is de&s;cribed by Chardin, produces, when it de&s;troys life, in&s;tant putrefaction. The bodies of men who die of violent pa&s;&s;ions, or after &s;trong convul&s;ions, or even after great mu&s;cular exertion, putrefy in a few hours after death. The healthy &s;tate of
<PB N="75" REF="027658_0082_0FD7C7B2663E38E0">
the body depends upon a certain &s;tate of arrange|ment in the fluids. A derangement of the&s;e fluids is the natural con&s;equence of the violent and ra|pid motions, or of the undue pre&s;&s;ure upon the &s;o|lids, which have been mentioned. It occurs in every ca&s;e of death from indirect debility, whe|ther it be induced by the exce&s;&s;ive &s;timulus of con|tagion, by the volatile vitriolic acid which is &s;up|po&s;ed to con&s;titute the de&s;tructive &s;amiel wind, or by violent commotions excited in the body by ex|ternal or internal cau&s;es. The practice among fi&s;hermen in &s;ome countries, of breaking the heads of their fi&s;h as &s;oon as they are taken out of the wa|ter, in order to retard their putrefaction, proves the truth of the explanation I have given of its cau&s;e, &s;oon after death. The &s;udden extinction of life in the fi&s;h, prevents tho&s;e convul&s;ive or violent mo|tions which induce &s;udden <HI>di&s;organization</HI> in their bodies. It was remarkable that putrefaction took place mo&s;t &s;peedily after death from the yellow fever, where the commotions of the &s;y&s;tem were not relieved by evacuations. In tho&s;e ca&s;es where purges and bleeding had been u&s;ed, putrefaction did not take place &s;ooner after death than is com|mon in any other febrile di&s;ea&s;e, under equal cir|cum&s;tances of heat and air.</P>
<P>There is a fact mentioned by Dr Ferriar, from Dr Hamilton, late profe&s;&s;or of anatomy at Gla&s;|gow,
<PB N="76" REF="027658_0083_0FD7C7C1A500EA68">
which may &s;eem at fir&s;t &s;ight to militate again&s;t the facts I have mentioned. He &s;ays that he had ob&s;erved bodies which were brought into the di&s;&s;ecting room, that had petechiae on them, were longer in putrefying than any others. The fevers of which the poor (the common &s;ubjects of di&s;&s;ection) die, are generally of the low ner|vous kind. Great <HI>direct</HI> debility is the charac|teri&s;tic of the&s;e fevers. The petechiae which oc|cur in them, appear in the la&s;t &s;tage of this direct debility. They are the effect, not of too much impetus in the blood, as in the yellow fever, but of a defect or total ab&s;ence of it in the la&s;t hours of life. The &s;low progre&s;s of the body to pu|trefaction after death, in the in&s;tances mentioned by Dr Hamilton, &s;eems to depend upon the &s;ame cau&s;e as that to which I have a&s;cribed it in tho&s;e ca&s;es of death from the yellow fever, in which e|vacuations had been u&s;ed, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>direct</HI> debility. In the former ca&s;es this &s;lowne&s;s of putrefaction is induced by nature&mdash;in the latter by art. The effects of debility from both cau&s;es are, notwith|&s;tanding, the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Thus have I de&s;cribed the &s;ymptoms of this fe|ver. From the hi&s;tory I have given, it appears that it counterfeited nearly all the acute and chronic di&s;ea&s;es, to which the human body is &s;ub|ject. An epitome, both of its &s;ymptoms and its the|ory,
<PB N="77" REF="027658_0084_0FD7C7B730426A78">
is happily delivered by Dr Sydenham in the following words. After de&s;cribing the epidemic cough, pleuri&s;y, and peripneumony of 1675, he adds, "But in other epidemics, the &s;ymptoms are &s;o &s;light from the di&s;turbance rai&s;ed in the blood by the morbific particles contained in the ma&s;s, that nature being in a manner <HI>oppre&s;&s;ed,</HI> is rendered unable to produce <HI>regular</HI> &s;ymptoms that are &s;uitable to the di&s;ea&s;e; and almo&s;t all the phaenomena that happen are <HI>irregular,</HI> by rea&s;on of the entire <HI>&s;ubver&s;ion</HI> of the animal oeconomy; in which ca&s;e the fever is often <HI>depre&s;&s;ed,</HI> which of its own nature, would be very high. Some|times al&s;o fewer &s;igns of a fever appear than the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e requires, from a tran&s;lation of the malignant cau&s;e, either to the nervous &s;y|&s;tem, to &s;ome other parts of the body, or to &s;ome of the juices not contained in the blood; whil&s;t the morbific matter is yet turgid"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wallis's edition, Vol. I. P. 344.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e ended in death in various ways. In &s;ome it was &s;udden; in others it came on by gra|dual approaches. In &s;ome the la&s;t hours of life were marked with great pain, and &s;trong convul|&s;ions; but in many more, death &s;eemed to in&s;inu|ate it&s;elf into the &s;y&s;tem, with all the gentlene&s;s of
<PB N="78" REF="027658_0085_0FD7CAFF160E02E8">
natural &s;leep. Mr Powell expired with a &s;mile on his countenance. Dr Griffitts informed me that Dr John&s;on exhibited the &s;ame &s;ymptom in the la&s;t hours of his life. This placid appearance of the countenance, in the act of dying, was not new to me. It frequently occurs in di&s;ea&s;es which affect the brain and nerves. I lo&s;t a patient three years ago in the gout, who not only &s;miled, but laughed, a few minutes before he expired.</P>
<P>I proceed now to mention &s;ome peculiarities of the fever which could not be brought in under any of the foregoing heads.</P>
<P>In every ca&s;e of this di&s;order which came under my notice, there were evident remi&s;&s;ions, or inter|mi&s;&s;ions of the fever, or of &s;uch &s;ymptoms as were &s;ub&s;tituted for fever. I have long con&s;idered with Mr Senac, a <HI>tertian</HI> as the only original type of all fevers. The bilious yellow fever indicated its de&s;cent from this parent di&s;order. I met with many ca&s;es of regular tertians in which the pa|tients were &s;o well on the intermediate days as to go abroad. It appeared in this form in Mr Van Berkel the mini&s;ter of the United Netherlands. Nor was this mild form of the fever devoid of danger. Many died who neglected it as a trifling di&s;order, or who took the common remedies for
<PB N="79" REF="027658_0086_0FD7CB00A79890F0">
intermittents to cure it. It generally ended in a remittent before it de&s;troyed the patient. The tertian type di&s;covered it&s;elf in &s;ome people after the more violent &s;ymptoms of the fever had been &s;ubdued, and continued in them for &s;everal weeks. It changed from a tertian to a quartan type in Mr Thomas Willing, nearly a month after his reco|very from the more acute and inflammatory &s;ymp|toms of the di&s;order.</P>
<P>It is nothing new for a malignant fever to ap|pear in the form of a tertian. It is frequently the garb of the plague. Riverius de&s;cribes a tertian fever which proved fatal on the third day, which was evidently derived from the &s;ame exhalation which produced a continual malignant fever.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Febre Pe&s;tilenti, vol. xi. p 9<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE></P>
<P>The remi&s;&s;ions were more evident in this, than in the common bilious fever. They generally oc|curred in the forenoon. It was my misfortune to be deprived by the great number of my patients, of that command of time which was nece&s;&s;ary to watch the exacerbations of this fever under all their various changes, as to time, force, and duration. From all the ob&s;ervations that were &s;ugge&s;ted by
<PB N="80" REF="027658_0087_0FD7CB068BAF60F8">
vi&s;its, at hours that were &s;eldom left to my choice, I was led to conclude, that the fever exhibited in different people all that variety of forms which has been de&s;cribed by Dr Cleghorn in his account of the tertian fever of Minorca. A violent ex|acerbation on even days was evidently attended with more danger than on odd days. The &s;ame thing was ob&s;erved by Dr Mitchell in the Yellow Fever of Virginia in the year 1741. <Q>If (&s;ays he) the exacerbations were on equal days, they generally died in the third paroxy&s;m, or the 6th day, but if on unequal days, they recovered on the 7th.</Q></P>
<P>The deaths which occurred on the 3d, 5th, and 7th days, appeared frequently to be the effects of the commotions or depre&s;&s;ion, produced in the &s;y&s;tem on the 2nd, 4th, and 6th days.</P>
<P>The remi&s;&s;ion on the third day, was frequently &s;uch as to beget a belief that the di&s;ea&s;e had run its cour&s;e, and that all danger was over. A vio|lent attack of the fever on the 4th day removed this deception, and if a relaxation had taken place in the u&s;e of proper remedies on the 3d day, death frequently occurred on the 5th or the &s;e|venth.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="027658_0088_0FD7C7BBDDF50588">
The termination of this fever in life, and death, was much more frequent on the 3d, 5th, 7th, 9th and 11th days, than is common in the mild remitting fever. Where death occurred on the even days, it &s;eemed to be the effect of a violent paroxi&s;m of the fever, or of great vigour of con|&s;titution, or of the force of medicines which pro|tracted &s;ome of the motions of life beyond the clo&s;e of the odd days which have been mentioned.</P>
<P>I think I ob&s;erved the fever to terminate on the third day more frequently in Augu&s;t, and during the fir&s;t ten days in September, than it did after the weather became cool. In this, it re&s;embled the common bilious remittents of our city, al&s;o the &s;imple tertians de&s;cribed by Dr Cleghorn<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Di&s;ea&s;es of Minorca, p. 185.</NOTE>. The danger &s;eemed to be in proportion to the tendency of the di&s;ea&s;e to a &s;peedy cri&s;is, hence more died in Augu&s;t in proportion to the number who were affected than in September or October, when the di&s;ea&s;e was left to it&s;elf. But, however &s;trange after this remark it may appear, the di&s;|ea&s;e yielded to the remedies which finally &s;ubdued it, more &s;peedily and certainly upon its fir&s;t ap|pearance in the city, than it did two or three weeks afterwards.</P>

The di&s;ea&s;e continued for fifteen, twenty, and even thirty days in &s;ome people. Its duration was much influenced by the weather, and by the u&s;e or neglect of certain remedies (to be men|tioned hereafter) in the fir&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;order.</P>
<P>It has been common with authors to divide the &s;ymptoms of this fever into three different &s;tages.

<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> includes tho&s;e in whom the &s;timulus of the contagion, produced the &s;ymptoms of indi|rect debility, &s;uch as coma, languor, &s;ighing, a di&s;|po&s;ition to &s;yncope, and a weak, or &s;low pul&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;econd</HI> includes tho&s;e in whom the conta|gion acted with le&s;s force, producing great pain in the head, and other parts of the body; deli|rium, vomiting, heat, thir&s;t, and a quick, ten&s;e, or full pul&s;e, with obvious remi&s;&s;ions or intermi&s;&s;ions of the fever.</P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> cla&s;s includes all tho&s;e per&s;ons in whom the &s;timulus of the contagion acted &s;o fee|bly as not to confine them to their beds or hou&s;es.

This cla&s;s of per&s;ons affected by the yellow fever, was very numerous. Many of them recovered without medical aid, or by the u&s;e of dome&s;tic pre&s;criptions; many of them recovered in con&s;e|quence of a &s;pontaneous diarrhoea, or plentiful &s;weats; many were &s;aved by moderate bleeding, and purging; while &s;ome died, who conceived their complaints to be occa&s;ioned by a common cold, and neglected to take proper care of them|&s;elves, or to u&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary means for their re|covery. It is not peculiar to the contagion of the yellow fever to produce this feeble operation up|on the &s;y&s;tem. It has been ob&s;erved in the &s;outh|ern &s;tates of America, that in tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons in which the common bilious fever is epidemic "no body is quite well," and that what are called in tho&s;e &s;tates "inward fevers" are univer&s;al. The &s;mall-pox even in the natural way, does not always confine the patient; and thou&s;ands pa&s;s through the plague without being confined to their beds or hou&s;es. Dr Hodges pre&s;cribed for this cla&s;s of patients in his parlour in London in the year 1665, and Dr Patrick Ru&s;&s;el did the &s;ame from a chamber window fifteen feet above the level of the &s;treet at Aleppo. Notwith&s;tanding the mild form the plague put on in the&s;e ca&s;es, it often proved fatal according to Dr Ru&s;&s;el. I have in|troduced the&s;e facts chiefly with a view of prepa|ring
<PB N="84" REF="027658_0091_0FD7CB0BD7091070">
the reader to reject the opinion that we had two &s;pecies of fever in the city at the &s;ame time; and to &s;hew that the yellow fever appears in a more &s;imple form than with "&s;trongly marked" characters; or in other words, with a yellow &s;kin, and a black vomitting.</P>
<P>It was remarkable that this fever always found out the weak part of every con&s;titution it attacked. The head, the lungs, the &s;tomach, the bowels, and the limbs, &s;uffered more or le&s;s, according as they were more or le&s;s debilitated by previous inflammatory, or nervous di&s;ea&s;es, or by a mix|ture of both, as in the gout.</P>
<P>I have before remarked, that the influenza, the &s;carlatina, and a mild bilious remittent, prevailed in the city, before the yellow fever made its ap|pearance. In the cour&s;e of a few weeks they all di&s;appeared, or appeared with &s;ymptoms of the yellow fever; &s;o that after the fir&s;t week of Sep|tember, it was the &s;olitary epidemic of the city.</P>
<P>The only ca&s;e like influenza which I &s;aw after the 5th of September, was in a girl of 14 years of age, on the 13th of the month. It came on with a &s;neezing and cough. I was called to her on the third day of her di&s;order. The in&s;tant I felt
<PB N="85" REF="027658_0092_0FD7CB0FA0CC60A8">
her pul&s;e, I pronounced her di&s;ea&s;e to be the yel|low fever. Her father was offended with this opinion, although he lived in a highly infected neighbourhood, and objected to the remedies I pre&s;cribed for her. In a few days &s;he died. In the cour&s;e of ten days, her father and &s;i&s;ter were infected, and both died I was informed, with the u&s;ual &s;ymptoms of the yellow fever.</P>
<P>It has been an axiom in medicine, time imme|morial, that no two contagious fevers of unequal force can exi&s;t long together in the &s;ame place. As this axiom &s;eems to have been forgotten by many of the phy&s;icians of Philadelphia, and as the ignorance or neglect of it, led to that contra|riety of opinion and practice, which unhappily took place in the treatment of the di&s;order, I hope I &s;hall be excu&s;ed by tho&s;e phy&s;icians to whom this fact is as familiar as the mo&s;t &s;imple law of nature, if I fill a few pages with proofs of it, from practical writers.</P>
<P>Thucydides long ago remarked that the plague cha&s;ed all other di&s;ea&s;es from Athens, or obliged them to change their nature, by a&s;&s;uming &s;ome of its &s;ymptoms.</P>

Dr Sydenham makes the &s;ame remark upon the plague in London in 1665. Dr Hodges in his account of the &s;ame plague, &s;ays that "at the ri&s;e of the plague all other di&s;tempers, went into it, but at its declen&s;ion, that it degenerated into others, as inflammations, headach, quin&s;ies, dy|&s;enteries, &s;mall-pox, mea&s;les, fevers, and hectics, wherein the plague yet predominated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr Hodges Account of the Plague in London, p. 26.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>During the prevalence of the plague in Grand Cairo, no &s;poradic di&s;ea&s;e of any kind makes its appearance. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation is made by Sauvage in his account of the plague at Alais in the province of Languedoc<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sed hoc ob&s;ervatu dignum fuit, omnes alios morbos acutos, durante pe&s;te <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ilui&s;&s;e, et omnes morbos acutos e pe&s;|tis genere &s;ui&s;&s;e.

<P>The &s;mall-pox though a di&s;ea&s;e of le&s;s force than the plague, has often cha&s;ed it from Con&s;tantino|ple, probably from its infecting at a greater di&s;tance than the plague. But this exclu&s;ive prevalence of a &s;ingle epidemic is not confined to the plague and &s;mall-pox. Dr Sydenham's writings are full of proofs of the dominion of febrile di&s;ea&s;es over each other: Hence after treating upon a &s;ympto|matic

It appears further from the writings of this excellent phy&s;ician, that where the monarchy of a &s;ingle di&s;ea&s;e was not immediately acknowledged, by a &s;udden retreat of all cotemporary di&s;ea&s;es, they were forced to do homage to it, by wearing its livery. It would be ea&s;y to multiply proofs of this a&s;&s;ertion, from the numerous hi&s;tories of epidemics which are to be found in his works. I &s;hall mention only one or two of them. A continual fever accompanied by a dry &s;kin, had prevailed for &s;ome time in the city of London. During the continuance of this fever, the regular &s;mall-pox made its appearance.

The bilious remitting fever which prevailed in Philadelphia in 1780, cha&s;ed away every other febrile di&s;ea&s;e; and the &s;carlatina angino&s;a which prevailed in our city in 1783 and 1784, furni&s;hed a &s;triking proof of the influence of epidemics over each other. In the account which I publi&s;hed of this di&s;ea&s;e, in the year 1789, there are the follow|ing remarks. "The intermitting fever which made its appearance in Augu&s;t, was not lo&s;t du|ring the month of September. It continued to prevail, but with &s;everal peculiar &s;ymptoms.

<P>I &s;hall mention only one more authority in fa|vour of the influence of a &s;ingle epidemic upon di&s;ea&s;es. It is taken from Mr Clark's e&s;&s;ay on the epidemic di&s;ea&s;e of lying-in women, of the

"There does not appear to be any thing in a parturient &s;tate, which can prevent women from being affected by the gene|ral cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e at that time; and &s;hould they become ill, their complaints will probably partake of the nature of the reigning epidemic<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE>." I have &s;aid that the fever &s;ometimes put on the &s;ymp|toms of dy&s;entery, pleuri&s;y, rheumati&s;m, colic, pal&s;y, and even of the locked jaw. That the&s;e were not original di&s;ea&s;es, but &s;ymptomatic af|fections only of the reigning epidemic, will appear from other hi&s;tories of bilious fevers. Dr Bal|four tells us in his account of the inte&s;tinal remit|ting fever of Bengal<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE>, that it often appeared with &s;ymptoms of dy&s;entery, rheumati&s;m, and pleuri&s;y. Dr Cleghorn and Dr Lind mention many ca&s;es of the bilious fever appearing in the form of a dy&s;entery.

as the yellow fever had &s;ymptoms, but to vindi|cate my&s;elf from the charge of innovation, in ha|ving uniformly and unequivocally a&s;&s;erted, after the fir&s;t week in September, that the yellow fever was the only febrile di&s;ea&s;e which prevailed in the city.

<P>The facts I have delivered upon this &s;ubject will admit of a very important application to the cure, not only of the yellow fever, but of all other acute and dangerous epidemics.

<P>All ages were affected by this fever, but per|&s;ons between fourteen, and forty years of age, were mo&s;t &s;ubject to it. Many old people had it, but it was not &s;o fatal to them, as to robu&s;t per|&s;ons in middle life. It affected children of all ages. I met with a violent ca&s;e of the di&s;order, in a child of four months, and a moderate ca&s;e of it, in a child of only ten weeks old. The latter had caught it from its mother. It had a deep yel|low &s;kin. Both the&s;e children recovered.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="027658_0101_0FD7C7D2A91DA280">
The proportion of children who &s;uffered by this fever may be conceived from a &s;ingle fact. Seventy five per&s;ons were buried in the grave|yard of the Swedi&s;h Church in the months of Augu&s;t, September, and October, twenty four of whom were children. They were buried chiefly in September and October; months, in which chil|dren, generally enjoy good health in our city.</P>
<P>Men were more &s;ubject to the di&s;ea&s;e than wo|men. Pregnancy &s;eemed to expo&s;e women to it.</P>
<P>The refugees from the French We&s;t-Indies, univer&s;ally e&s;caped it. This was not the ca&s;e with the natives of France, who had been &s;ettled in the city.</P>
<P>It is nothing new, for epidemics to affect per|&s;ons of one nation, and to pa&s;s by per&s;ons of other nations in the &s;ame city or country. At Nimu|guen in the year 1736, Deigner informs us that the French people, (two old men excepted), and the Jews, e&s;caped a dy&s;entery which was univer|&s;al among per&s;ons of all other nations. Ramazini tells us that the Jews at Modena, e&s;caped a tertian fever which affected nearly all the other inhabi|tants of the town. Shenkius &s;ays that the Dutch
<PB N="95" REF="027658_0102_0FD7C822E67E1488">
and Italians e&s;caped a plague which prevailed for two years in one of the towns of Switzerland, and Dr Bell, in an inaugural di&s;&s;ertaion publi&s;hed at Edinburgh in 1779, remarks that the jail fever which attacked the &s;oldiers of the Duke of Buc|cleugh's regiment, &s;pared the French pri&s;oners who were guarded by them. It is difficult to account for the&s;e facts. However numerous their cau&s;es may be, a difference in diet which is as much a di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of nations as dre&s;s, or man|ners, will probably be found to be one of them.</P>
<P>From the accounts of the yellow fever which had been publi&s;hed by many writers, I was led to believe that the negroes in our city would e&s;cape it. In con&s;equence of this belief, I publi&s;hed the following extract from Dr Lining's hi&s;tory of the yellow fever as it had four times appeared in Charle&s;ton in South-Carolina.</P>

There did not appear to be any advantage from &s;melling vinegar, tar, camphor, or volatile &s;alts, in preventing the di&s;order. Bark and wine were equally ineffectual for that purpo&s;e. I was called to many hundred people who were infected after u&s;ing one or more of them. Nor did the white-wa&s;hing of walls &s;ecure families from the action of the contagion. I am di&s;po&s;ed to believe garlick was the only &s;ub&s;tance that was in any degree u&s;e|ful, in preventing the di&s;order. I met with &s;eve|ral per&s;ons who chewed it con&s;tantly, and who were much expo&s;ed to the contagion, without being infected. All other &s;ub&s;tances &s;eemed to do harm by begetting a fal&s;e confidence in the mind, to the exclu&s;ion of more rational pre&s;erva|tives.

I have &s;aid formerly that intemperance in drink|ing predi&s;po&s;ed to the di&s;ea&s;e; but there were &s;e|veral in&s;tances of per&s;ons having e&s;caped it who were con&s;tantly under the influence of &s;trong drink. The &s;timulus of ardent &s;pirits, probably predominated over the &s;timulus of the contagion, and thus excited an artificial fever which defended the &s;y&s;tem from that which was epidemic.</P>
<P>I heard of &s;ome &s;ea-faring people who lived on board their ve&s;&s;els who e&s;caped the di&s;ea&s;e.

<P>Many people who were infected in the city, were attacked by the di&s;ea&s;e in the country, but they propagated it in very few in&s;tances, even to per&s;ons who &s;lept in the &s;ame room with them.</P>
<P>Dr Lind informs us that many per&s;ons e&s;caped the yellow fever which prevailed in Pen&s;acola in the year 1765, by retiring to the &s;hips which lay in the harbour, and that when the di&s;ea&s;e had been taken, the pure air of the water changed it

into an intermitting fever<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Di&s;ea&s;es of Warm Climates, p. 169.</NOTE>. The &s;ame changes have frequently been produced in malignant fevers, by &s;ending patients infected with them from the foul air of a city, into the pure air of the country.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons confined in the Hou&s;e of Employment, in the Ho&s;pital, and in the Jail, were pre&s;erved from the fever. The airy and remote &s;ituation of tho&s;e buildings, was probably the chief means of their pre&s;ervation.

<P>Several families who &s;hut up their front and back doors and windows, and avoided going out of their hou&s;es except to procure provi&s;ions, e&s;ca|ped the di&s;order.</P>
<P>I have taken &s;ome pains to a&s;certain whether any cla&s;s of trade&s;men e&s;caped the fever, or whe|ther there was any &s;pecies of labour which pro|tected from it. The re&s;ult of my inquiries is as follows: Three butchers only out of nearly one hundred who remained in the city, died with the di&s;order. Many of them attended the markets
<PB N="102" REF="027658_0109_0FD7CB21963F3890">
every day. Two painters, who worked at their bu&s;ine&s;s during the whole time of the prevalence of the fever, and in expo&s;ed &s;ituations, e&s;caped it. Out of forty &s;cavengers who were employed in collecting and carrying away the dirt of the &s;treets, only one caught the fever and died. Very few grave-diggers, compared with the number who were employed in that bu&s;ine&s;s, were infected; and it is well known, that &s;carcely an in&s;tance was heard of per&s;ons taking the di&s;ea&s;e, who were con&s;tantly employed in digging cellars. The fact is not new that grave-diggers e&s;cape the conta|gion of malignant fevers. It is taken notice of by Dr Clark. There &s;eems to be &s;omething in the fre&s;h earth which attracts or de&s;troys by mixture, contagion of every kind. Clothes infected by the &s;mall-pox are more certainly purified by being bu|ried under ground, than in any other way. Even poi&s;ons are rendered inert, by the action of the earth upon them. Dogs have long ago e&s;tabli&s;hed this fact, by &s;cratching a hole in the ground, and burying their limbs or no&s;es in it, when bitten by poi&s;onous &s;nakes. The practice I have been told, has been imitated with &s;ucce&s;s by the &s;ettlers upon new lands in &s;everal parts of the United States.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid by &s;ome phy&s;icians in the public pa|pers, that the neighbourhood of the grave-yards
<PB N="103" REF="027658_0110_0FD7C7E032CD1C98">
was more infected than other parts of the city. The rever&s;e of this a&s;&s;ertion was true in &s;everal ca&s;es, owing probably to the line of communica|tion of the contagion being broken by the ab&s;ence of hou&s;es, and to its being diluted and weakened by its mixture with the air of the grave-yards; for this air was pure, compared with that which &s;tagnated in the &s;treets.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid further, that the di&s;ea&s;e was propa|gated by the inhabitants a&s;&s;embling on Sundays for public wor&s;hip; and as a proof of this a&s;&s;er|tion, it was reported, that the deaths were more numerous on Sundays than on other days; occa|&s;ioned by the contagion received on one Sunday, producing death on the &s;ucceding fir&s;t day of the week. The regi&s;ter of the deaths &s;hows that this was not the ca&s;e. I am di&s;po&s;ed to believe that few|er people &s;ickened on Sundays, than on any other day of the week; owing to the general re&s;t from labour, which I have before &s;aid was one of the exciting cau&s;es of the di&s;ea&s;e. From &s;ome facts to be mentioned pre&s;ently, it will appear probable, that places of public wor&s;hip, in con&s;equence of their &s;ize, as well as of their being &s;hut up during the greate&s;t part of the week, were the free&s;t from contagion of any hou&s;es in the city.

<P>There were for &s;everal weeks two &s;ources of infection, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> exhalation, and contagion. The ex|halation infected at the di&s;tance of three and four hundred yards; while the contagion infected only acro&s;s the &s;treets. The more narrow the &s;treet, the more certainly the contagion infected. Few e&s;caped it in alleys. After the 15th of Septem|ber, the atmo&s;phere of every &s;treet in the city was loaded with contagion; and there were few citi|zens in apparent good health, who did not ex|hibit one or more of the following marks of its pre&s;ence in their bodies.</P>
<P N="1">1. A yellowne&s;s in the eyes, and a &s;allow co|lour upon the &s;kin.</P>
<P N="2">2. A preternatural quickne&s;s in the pul&s;e. I found but two exceptions to this remark, out of a great number of per&s;ons who&s;e pul&s;es I examined. In one of them it di&s;covered &s;everal preternatural intermi&s;&s;ions in the cour&s;e of a minute. This quickne&s;s of pul&s;e occurred in the negroes, as well as in the white people.

In two women, and in one man above 70, the pul&s;e beat upwards of 90 &s;trokes in a minute.

<P>It will be thought le&s;s &s;trange, that the conta|gion &s;hould produce the&s;e changes in the &s;y&s;tems of per&s;ons who re&s;ided con&s;tantly in the city, when I add, that many country people who &s;pent but a few hours in the &s;treets in the day, in attend|ing the markets, caught the di&s;ea&s;e, and &s;ickened and died after they returned home; and that others, whom bu&s;ine&s;s compelled to &s;pend a day or two in the city during the prevalence of the fever, but who e&s;caped an attack of it, declared that they were indi&s;po&s;ed during the whole time, with languor or head-ach.</P>
<P>I was led to ob&s;erve and record the above ef|fects of the contagion upon per&s;ons in apparent good health, by a fact I met with in Dr Mitchell's hi&s;tory of the yellow fever in Virginia in the year 1741. In that fever, blood drawn from a vein was always di&s;&s;olved. The &s;ame &s;tate of the blood was ob&s;erved in many per&s;ons who had been ex|po&s;ed to the contagion, who di&s;covered no other &s;ymptom of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="027658_0114_0FD7CB2ACBAD2A90">
A woman whom I had formerly cured of a ma|nia, who lived in an infected neighbourhood, had a fre&s;h attack of that di&s;order, accompanied by an unu&s;ual men&s;trual flux. I a&s;cribed both the&s;e complaints to the action of the contagion upon her &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Citizens thus impregnated with the contagion, communicated it in &s;everal in&s;tances to their coun|try friends. The di&s;ea&s;e produced in this way was very light, amounting in all the ca&s;es that came under my notice, to little more than a &s;ickne&s;s at &s;tomach or vomiting.</P>
<P>The &s;mell of the contagion, as emitted from a patient in a clean room, was like that of the &s;mall-pox, but in mo&s;t ca&s;es of a le&s;s di&s;agreeable na|ture. Putrid &s;mells in &s;ick rooms were the ef|fects of a mixture of the contagion with &s;ome fil|thy matters. In &s;mall rooms, crouded in &s;ome in|&s;tances with four or five &s;ick people, there was an effluvia that produced giddine&s;s, &s;ickne&s;s at &s;to|mach, a weakne&s;s of the limbs, faintne&s;s, and in &s;ome ca&s;es a diarrhoea. I met with a fetid breath in one patient, which was not the effect of that medicine which &s;ometimes produces it.</P>
<P>The contagion adhered to all kinds of cloath|ing, and &s;eemed to be propagated by them. It

was in no in&s;tance communicated by means of pa|per; a circum&s;tance which contributed both to le&s;&s;en and encrea&s;e the di&s;tre&s;s produced by the di&s;|ea&s;e, by enabling the citizens to keep up an inter|cour&s;e, by letters with their country friends.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere during the whole month of September, and the fir&s;t two weeks in October favoured the accumulation of the conta|gion in the city.</P>
<P>The regi&s;ter of the weather, &s;hews how little the air was agitated by winds during the above time. In vain were changes in the moon ex|pected to alter the &s;tate of the air. The light of the morning, mocked the hopes that were rai&s;ed by a cloudy &s;ky in the evening. The &s;un cea&s;ed to be viewed with plea&s;ure. Hundreds &s;ickened every day beneath the influence of his rays; and even where they did not excite the di&s;|ea&s;e, they produced a languor in the body un|known to the olde&s;t inhabitant of the city, at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on of the year.</P>
<P>A meteor was &s;een at two o'clock in the morn|ing on or about the twelfth of September. It fell between Third-&s;treet and the Ho&s;pital, nearly in a line with Pine-&s;treet. Mo&s;chetoes (the u&s;ual attendants of a &s;ickly autumn) were uncommonly

<P>It appears further, from the regi&s;ter of the wea|ther, that there was no rain between the 25th of Augu&s;t and the 15th of October, except a few drops, hardly enough to lay the du&s;t of the &s;treets on the 9th of September, and the 12th of Octo|ber. In con&s;equence of this drought, the &s;prings and wells failed in many parts of the country. The du&s;t in &s;ome places extended two feet below the &s;urface of the ground. The pa&s;tures were defi|cient, or burnt up. There was a &s;carcity of au|tumnal fruits in the neighbourhood of the city. But while vegetation drooped or died from the want of moi&s;ture in &s;ome places, it revived with preternatural vigor from unu&s;ual heat in others. Cherry-trees blo&s;&s;omed, and apple, pear, and plum-trees bore young fruit in &s;everal gardens in Trenton, thirty miles from Philadelphia, in the month of October.</P>

exi&s;t at that time in our city that was not derived from this contagion?</P>
<P>The We&s;t India writers upon the yellow fever have &s;aid, that it is &s;eldom taken twice, except by per&s;ons who have &s;pent &s;ome years in Europe or America in the interval between its fir&s;t and &s;econd attack. I directed my inquiries to this que&s;tion, and I now proceed to mention the re&s;ult of them. I met with five per&s;ons during the prevalence of the di&s;ea&s;e, who had had it formerly; two of them in the year 1741, and three in 1762, who e&s;caped it in 1793, although they were all more or le&s;s expo&s;ed to the contagion. One of them felt a con&s;tant pain in her head while the di&s;ea&s;e was in her family. Four of them were aged, and of cour&s;e le&s;s liable to be acted upon by the conta|gion, than per&s;ons in early or middle life. Mr Thomas Shields furni&s;hed an unequivocal proof that the di&s;ea&s;e could be taken after an interval of many years. He had it in the year 1762, and narrowly e&s;caped from a violent attack of it la&s;t year. Ca&s;es of reinfection were very common during the prevalence of this fever. They occur|red mo&s;t frequently, where the fir&s;t attack had been light. But they &s;ucceeded attacks that were &s;evere in Dr Griffitts, Dr Mea&s;e, my pupil

Mr Coxe, and &s;everal others, who&s;e ca&s;es came under my notice.</P>
<P>I have before remarked, that the contagion &s;ometimes excited a fever as &s;oon as it was taken into the body, but that it often lay there from one to &s;ixteen days, before it produced the di&s;ea&s;e. How long it exi&s;ted in the body after a recovery from the fever, I could not tell, for per&s;ons who recovered were in mo&s;t ca&s;es expo&s;ed to the action of the contagion from external &s;ources. The pre|ternatural dilatation of the pupils was a certain mark of the continuance of &s;ome portion of the contagion in the &s;y&s;tem. In one per&s;on who was attacked with the fever on the night of the 9th of October, the pupils did not contract to their natural dimen&s;ions, until the 7th of November.</P>
<P>Having de&s;cribed the effects of the contagion upon the body, I proceed now to mention the changes induced upon it by death.</P>
<P>Let us fir&s;t take a view of it as it appeared &s;oon after death. Some new light may perhaps be thrown upon the proximate cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, by this mode of examining the body.</P>

My information upon this &s;ubject was derived from the attendants upon the &s;ick, and from the two African citizens who were employed in bury|ing the dead, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Richard Allen and Ab&s;alom Jones. The coincidence of the information I re|ceived from different per&s;ons, &s;atisfied me that all that I &s;hall here relate, is both accurate and ju&s;t.</P>
<P>A deep yellow colour appeared in many ca&s;es within a few minutes after death. In &s;ome, the &s;kin became purple, and in others black. I heard of one ca&s;e in which the body was yellow above, and black below its middle. In &s;ome, the &s;kin was as pale, as it is in per&s;ons who die of common fevers. A placid countenance was ob&s;erved in many, re&s;embling that which occurs in an ea&s;y and healthful &s;leep.</P>
<P>Some were &s;tiff within one hour after death. Others were not &s;o, for &s;ix hours afterwards. This &s;udden &s;tiffne&s;s after death, Dr Valli informs us, occurred in per&s;ons who died of the plague in Smyrna in the year 1784<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Experiments on Animal Electricity, p. 90.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Many di&s;charged large quantities of black mat|ter from the bowels, and others blood from the no&s;e, mouth and bowels after death. The fre|quency of the&s;e di&s;charges, gave ri&s;e to the prac|tice of pitching the joints of the coffins which were u&s;ed to bury the dead.</P>
<P>The morbid appearances of the internal parts of the body as they appear by di&s;&s;ection after death, from the yellow fever, are different in dif|ferent countries, and in the &s;ame countries in dif|ferent years. I con&s;ider them all as effects only of a &s;timulus acting upon the whole &s;y&s;tem, and determined more or le&s;s by accidental circum&s;tan|ces, to particular vi&s;cera. Perhaps the &s;timulus of the contagion determines the fluids more vio|lently in mo&s;t ca&s;es to the liver, &s;tomach, and bow|els, and thereby di&s;po&s;es them more than other

parts to inflammation and mortification, and to &s;imilar effu&s;ions and eruptions with tho&s;e which take place on the &s;kin.

I tran&s;cribe with great plea&s;ure the following ac|count of the &s;tate of the bile in a female &s;lave of forty years of age from Dr Mitchell's hi&s;tory of the yellow fever, as it prevailed in Virginia in the years 1737 and 1741, ina&s;much as it was part of that clue which led me to adopt one of the remedies on which much of the &s;ucce&s;s of my practice depended.</P>
<P>"The gall bladder (&s;ays the Doctor) appeared outwardly of a deep yellow, but within was full of a black ropy coagulated atrabilis, which &s;ort of &s;ub&s;tance ob&s;tructed the pori biliarii, and duc|tus choledochus. This atrabilis was hardly fluid, but upon opening the gall bladder, it retained its form, and &s;hape, without being evacuated, being of the con&s;i&s;tence of a thin extract, and within, glutinous and ropy, like &s;oap when boiling. This black matter &s;eemed &s;o much unlike bile, that I doubted if there were any bile in the gall-bladder. It more re&s;embled brui&s;ed or mortified blood, eva|cuated from the mortified parts of the liver, &s;ur|rounding it, although it would &s;tain a knife or probe thru&s;t into it of a yellow colour, which with

<P>The liver in the abovementioned &s;lave, was tur|gid and plump on its out&s;ide, but on its concave &s;urface, two thirds of it were of a deep black co|lour, and round the gall-bladder, it &s;eemed to be mortified and corrupted.</P>
<P>The duodenum was lined on its in&s;ide near the gall bladder with a vi&s;cid ropy bile, like that which has been de&s;cribed. Its villous coat was li|ned with a thick fur or &s;lime, which when &s;craped or pealed off, the other va&s;cular and mu&s;cular coats of the gut, appeared red and inflamed.</P>
<P>The omentum was &s;o much wa&s;ted, that no|thing but its blood-ve&s;&s;els could be perceived.</P>
<P>The &s;tomach was inflamed both on its out&s;ide and in&s;ide. It contained a quantity of bile of the &s;ame con&s;i&s;tence, but of a blacker colour than that which was found in the gall bladder. Its villous coat like that of the duodenum, was covered with fuzzy and &s;limy matter. It moreover appeared to
<PB N="117" REF="027658_0124_0FD7CB3F9A9D04D0">
be di&s;tended or &s;welled. This peculiarity in the inner coat of the &s;tomach was univer&s;al in all the bodies that were opened, of per&s;ons who died of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The lungs in&s;tead of being collap&s;ed, were in|flated as in in&s;piration. They were all over full of black or livid &s;pots. On the&s;e &s;pots were to be &s;een &s;mall ve&s;icles or bli&s;ters, like tho&s;e of an ery&s;ipelas or gangrene, containing a yellow hu|mour.</P>
<P>The blood-ve&s;&s;els in general &s;eemed empty of blood, even the vena cava and its branches; but the vena portarum was full and di&s;tended as u&s;ual. The blood &s;eemed <HI>collected</HI> in the <HI>vi&s;cera;</HI> for up|on cutting the lungs or &s;ound liver or &s;pleen, they bled freely.</P>
<P>The brain was not opened in this body, but it was not affected in three others who&s;e brains were examined.</P>
<P>Dr Mackittrick, in his inaugural di&s;&s;ertation publi&s;hed at Edinburgh in the year 1766 "De fe|bre Indiae occidentalis, Maligna Flava," or upon the yellow fever of the We&s;t Indies, &s;ays, that in &s;ome of the patients who died of it, he found the
<PB N="118" REF="027658_0125_0FD7CB41142B5480">
liver &s;phacelated, the gall bladder full of black bile, and the veins turgid with black fluid blood. In others he found the liver no ways enlarged, and its "texture only vitiated." The &s;tomach, the duodenum, and ilium, were remarkably infla|med in all ca&s;es. The pericardium contained a vi&s;cid yellow &s;erum, and in a larger quantity than common. The urinary bladder was a little infla|med. The lungs were &s;ound.</P>
<P>Dr Hume in de&s;cribing the yellow fever of Ja|maica, informs us, that in &s;everal dead bodies which he opened, he found the liver enlarged and turgid with bile, and of a pale yellow colour. In &s;ome he found the &s;tomach and duodenum infla|med. In one ca&s;e he di&s;covered black &s;pots in the &s;tomach, of the &s;ize of a crown piece. To this account he adds, "that he had &s;een &s;ome &s;ub|jects opened, on who&s;e &s;tomachs <HI>no marks of in|flammation</HI> could be di&s;covered; and yet the&s;e had exce&s;&s;ive vomiting."</P>
<P>Dr Lind has furni&s;hed us with an account of the &s;tate of the body after death in his &s;hort hi&s;to|ry of the yellow fever, which prevailed at Cadiz in the year 1764. "The &s;tomach, (he &s;ays) me|&s;entery, and inte&s;tines were covered with gangre|nous &s;pots: there were ulcers on the orifice of the

&s;tomach, and the liver and lungs were of a putrid colour and texture<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Di&s;ea&s;es of Warm Climates, p. 125.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>To the&s;e accounts of the morbid appearances of the body after death from the yellow fever, I &s;hall only add the account of &s;everal di&s;&s;ections which was given to the public in Mr Brown's Ga|zette, during the prevalence of our late epidemic, by Dr Phy&s;ic and Dr Cathrall.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>BEING well a&s;&s;ured of the great importance of di&s;&s;ections of morbid bodies in the inve&s;tigation of the nature of di&s;ea&s;es, we have thought it of con&s;equence that &s;ome of tho&s;e, dead of the pre&s;ent prevailing malignant fever, &s;hould be examined; and without enlarging on our ob&s;ervations, it ap|pears at pre&s;ent &s;ufficient to &s;tate the following facts.</P>
<P>1&s;t. That the brain in all its parts has been found in a natural condition.</P>
<P>2d. That the vi&s;cera of the thorax are perfect|ly &s;ound. The blood, however, in the heart and veins is fluid, &s;imilar in its con&s;i&s;tence, to the blood of per&s;ons who have been hanged, or de&s;troyed by electricity.</P>
<PB N="120" REF="027658_0127_0FD7CB4962BE2E28">
<P>3d. That the &s;tomach, and beginning of the duodenum are the parts that appear mo&s;t di&s;ea&s;ed. In two per&s;ons who died of the di&s;ea&s;e on the 5th day, the villous membrane of the &s;tomach, e&s;peci|ally about its &s;maller end, was found highly infla|med; and this inflammation extended through the pylorus into the duodenum, &s;ome way.&mdash;The in|flammation here, was exactly &s;imilar to that indu|ced in the &s;tomach by acrid poi&s;ons, as by ar&s;enic, which we have once had an opportunity of &s;eeing in a per&s;on de&s;troyed by it.</P>
<P>The bile in the gall-bladder was quite of its natural colour, though very vi&s;cid.</P>
<P>In another per&s;on who died on the 8th day of the di&s;ea&s;e, &s;everal &s;pots of extrava&s;ation were di&s;covered between the membranes, particularly about the &s;maller end of the &s;tomach, the inflam|mation of which had con&s;iderably abated. Pus was &s;een in the beginning of the duodenum, and the villous membrane at this part was thickened.</P>
<P>In two other per&s;ons who died at a more ad|vanced period of the di&s;ea&s;e, the &s;tomach appeared &s;potted in many places with extrava&s;ations, and the inflammation di&s;appeared. It contained, as did al&s;o the inte&s;tines, a black liquor, which had been
<PB N="121" REF="027658_0128_0FD7C7EB69306730">
vomited and purged before death. This black li|quor appears clearly to be an altered &s;ecretion from the liver; for a fluid in all re&s;pects of the &s;ame qualities was found in the gall-bladder. This liquor was &s;o acrid, that it induced con&s;ide|rable inflammation and &s;welling on the operator's hands, which remained &s;ome days. The villous membrane of the inte&s;tines in the&s;e la&s;t two bodies was found inflamed in &s;everal places.</P>
<P>The liver was of its natural appearance, ex|cepting in one of the la&s;t per&s;ons, on the &s;ur|face of which a very few di&s;tended veins were &s;een: all the other abdominal vi&s;cera were of a healthy appearance.</P>
<P>The external &s;urface of the &s;tomach as well as of the inte&s;tines, was quite free from inflamma|tion; the veins being di&s;tended with blood, which appeared through the tran&s;parent peritoneum, gave them a dark colour.</P>
<P>"The &s;tomach of tho&s;e who died early in the di&s;|ea&s;e was always contracted; but in tho&s;e who died at a more advanced period of it, where extrava&s;a|tions appeared, it was di&s;tended with air."</P>

<P><PB N="122" REF="027658_0129_0FD7CB4B2E728890">
I have before remarked that the&s;e di&s;&s;ections were made early in the di&s;order, and that Dr Annan attended a di&s;&s;ection of a body at Bu&s;h-hill &s;ome time afterwards, in which an unu|&s;ual turge&s;cence appeared in the ve&s;&s;els of the brain.</P>
<P>Thus far have I delivered the hi&s;tory of the yel|low fever as it affected the human body with &s;ick|ne&s;s and death. I &s;hall now mention a few of tho&s;e circum&s;tances of public and private di&s;tre&s;s which attended it. I have before remarked, that the fir&s;t reports of the exi&s;tence of this fever were treated with neglect or contempt. A &s;trange apa|thy pervaded all cla&s;&s;es of people. While I bore my &s;hare of reproach for "terrifying our citizens with imaginary danger," I an&s;wered it by lament|ing "that they were not terrified enough." The publication from the college of phy&s;icians &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated this indifference and incredulity. Fear or terror now &s;at upon every countenance. The di&s;ea&s;e appeared in many parts of the town, re|mote from the &s;pot where it originated; although in every in&s;tance it was ea&s;ily traced to it. This &s;et the city in motion. The &s;treets and roads leading from the city were crouded with families flying in every direction for &s;afety to the country. Bu&s;ine&s;s began to langui&s;h. Water-&s;treet be|tween Market and Race-&s;treets became a de&s;art.
<PB N="123" REF="027658_0130_0FD7CB4C82B22B98">
The poor were the fir&s;t victims of the fever. From the &s;udden interruption of bu&s;ine&s;s, they &s;uf|fered for a while from poverty, as well as di&s;ea&s;e. A large and airy hou&s;e at Bu&s;h-hill about a mile from the city, was opened for their reception. This hou&s;e, after it became the charge of a com|mittee appointed by the citizens on the 14th of September, was regulated and governed with the order and cleanline&s;s of an old and e&s;tabli&s;hed ho&s;|pital. An American and French phy&s;ician had the exclu&s;ive medical care of it after the 22d of September.</P>
<P>The contagion after the &s;econd week in Sep|tember, &s;pared no rank of citizens. Whole fa|milies were confined by it. There was a deficiency of nur&s;es for the &s;ick, and many of tho&s;e who were employed were unqualified for their bu&s;ine&s;s. There was likewi&s;e a great deficiency of phy&s;i|cians from the de&s;ertion of &s;ome, and the &s;ickne&s;s and death of others. At one time, there were only three phy&s;icians who were able to do bu&s;i|ne&s;s out of their hou&s;es, and at this time, there were probably not le&s;s than 6,000 per&s;ons ill with the fever.</P>
<P>During the fir&s;t three or four weeks of the prevalence of the di&s;order, I &s;eldom went into a
<PB N="124" REF="027658_0131_0FD7CB505225EF60">
hou&s;e the fir&s;t time, without meeting the parents or children of the &s;ick in tears. Many wept aloud in my entry, or parlour, who came to a&s;k for ad|vice for their relations. Grief, after awhile de|&s;cended below weeping, and I was much &s;truck in ob&s;erving that many per&s;ons &s;ubmitted to the lo&s;s of relations and friends, without &s;hedding a tear, or manife&s;ting any other of the common &s;igns of grief.</P>
<P>A chearful countenance was &s;carcely to be &s;een in the city for &s;ix weeks. I recollect once in en|tering the hou&s;e of a poor man, to have met a child of two years old that &s;miled in my face. I was &s;trangely affected with this &s;ight (&s;o di&s;cordant to my feelings and the &s;tate of the city) before I recollected the age and ignorance of the child. I was confined the next day by an attack of the fever, and was &s;orry to hear upon my recovery, that the father and mother of this little creature died, a few days after my la&s;t vi&s;it to them.</P>
<P>The &s;treets every where di&s;covered marks of the di&s;tre&s;s that pervaded the city. More than one half the hou&s;es were &s;hut up, although not more than one third of the inhabitants had fled into the country. In walking for many hundred yards, few per&s;ons were met, except &s;uch as were in que&s;t of
<PB N="125" REF="027658_0132_0FD7CB54C7F89E70">
a phy&s;ician, a nur&s;e, a bleeder, or the men who buried the dead. The hear&s;e alone kept up the remembrance of the noi&s;e of carriages or carts in the &s;treets. Funeral proce&s;&s;ions were laid a&s;ide. A black man, leading, or driving a hor&s;e, with a corp&s;e on a pair of chair wheels, with now and then half a dozen relations or friends following at a di&s;tance from it, met the eye in mo&s;t of the &s;treets of the city at every hour of the day, while the noi&s;e of the &s;ame wheels pa&s;&s;ing &s;lowly over the pavements, kept alive angui&s;h and fear in the &s;ick and well, every hour of the night<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the life of Thomas Story a celebrated preacher among the Friends, there is an account of the di&s;tre&s;s of the city in its infant &s;tate from the prevalence of the yellow fever in the autumn of 1699, nearly like that which has been de&s;cribed I &s;hall in&s;ert the account in his own words. "Great was the fear that fell on all fle&s;h. I &s;aw no lofty or airy countenance, nor heard any vain je&s;ting to move men to laughter. Every face gathered pale|ne&s;s, and many hearts were humbled, and countenances fallen, and &s;unk, as &s;uch that waited every moment to be &s;ummoned to the bar, and numbered to the grave." The &s;ame author adds that &s;ix, &s;even, and &s;ometimes eight died of this fever in a day for &s;everal weeks. His fellow tra|veller and companion in the mini&s;try Roger Gill, di&s;co|vered upon this occa&s;ion an extraordinary degree of Chri&s;|tian philanthropy. He publicly offered him&s;elf in one of the meetings of the Society as a &s;acrifice for the people, and prayed that "God would plea&s;e to accept of his life for them, that a &s;top might be put to the contagion." He died of the fever a few days afterwards.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="027658_0133_0FD7C7F0DBAE3268">
But a more &s;erious &s;ource of the di&s;tre&s;s of the city aro&s;e from the di&s;&s;entions of the phy&s;icians, about the nature and treatment of the fever. It was con&s;idered by &s;ome, as a modification of the influenza, and by others as the Jail fever. Its va|rious grades, and &s;ymptoms were con&s;idered as &s;o many different di&s;ea&s;es, all originating from differ|ent cau&s;es. There was the &s;ame contrariety in the practice of the phy&s;icians that there was in their principles. The new&s;papers conveyed ac|counts of both to the public, every day. The minds of the citizens were di&s;tracted by them, and hundreds &s;uffered and died from the delays which were produced by an erroneous opinion of a plu|rality of di&s;ea&s;es in the city, or by indeci&s;ion in the choice, or a want of confidence in the reme|dies of their phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>The &s;cience of medicine is related to every thing, and the philo&s;opher as well as the Chri&s;|tian will be gratified by knowing the effects of a great and mortal epidemic upon the morals of a people. It was &s;ome alleviation of the di&s;tre&s;s
<PB N="127" REF="027658_0134_0FD7C7F3A5F9E898">
produced by it, to ob&s;erve its influence upon the obligations of morality and religion. It was re|marked during this time, by many people that the name of the Supreme Being was &s;eldom profaned either in the &s;treets, or in the intercour&s;e of the citizens with each other. Two robberies only, and tho&s;e of a trifling nature, occured in nearly two months, although many hundred hou&s;es were ex|po&s;ed to plunder, every hour of the day and night. Many of the religious &s;ocieties met two or three times a week, and &s;ome of them every evening, to implore the interpo&s;ition of heaven to &s;ave the city from de&s;olation. Humanity and charity kept pace with devotion. The public have already &s;een accounts of their benevolent exerci&s;es in other publications. It was my lot to witne&s;s the uncom|mon activity of tho&s;e virtues upon a &s;maller &s;cale. I &s;aw little to blame, but much to admire and prai&s;e in per&s;ons of different profe&s;&s;ions, both &s;exes, and of all colours. It would be foreign to the de&s;ign of this work, to draw from the ob&s;curity which they &s;ought, the many acts of humanity and charity, of fortitude, patience, and per&s;eve|rance which came under my notice. They will be made public, and applauded el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>But the virtues which were excited by our ca|lamity, were not confined to the city of Philadel|phia.
<PB N="128" REF="027658_0135_0FD7CB54C9CB8D98">
The United States wept for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their capital. In &s;everal of the &s;tates, and in many cities, and villages, days of humiliation and prayer were &s;et apart to &s;upplicate the Father of mercies in behalf of our afflicted city. Nor was this all. From nearly every &s;tate in the Union, the mo&s;t liberal contributions of money, provi&s;ions, and fuel, were poured in for the relief and &s;upport of &s;uch as had been reduced to want, by the &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion of bu&s;ine&s;s, as well as by &s;ickne&s;s, and the death of friends.</P>
<P>The number of deaths between the fir&s;t of Au|gu&s;t and the ninth of November, amounted to four thou&s;and and forty four. I &s;hall here in&s;ert a regi&s;ter of the number which occurred on each day, beginning on the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t and ending on the ninth of November. By comparing it with the regi&s;ter of the weather, it will &s;hew the influence of the latter on the di&s;ea&s;e. Several of the deaths in Augu&s;t were from other acute di&s;|orders, and a few in the &s;ucceeding months were from &s;uch as were of a chronic nature.</P>

heavy rains. The u&s;ual time for its arrival had come, but the weather was &s;till not only moderate, but warm. In this awful &s;ituation, the &s;toute&s;t hearts began to fail. Hope &s;ickened, and de&s;pair &s;ucceeded di&s;tre&s;s in almo&s;t every countenance. On the <HI>fifteenth</HI> of October it plea&s;ed God to alter the &s;tate of the air. The clouds at la&s;t drop|ped health in &s;howers of rain, which continued during the whole day, and which were &s;ucceeded for &s;everal nights afterwards by cold and fro&s;t. The effects of this change in the weather, appear|ed fir&s;t in the &s;udden diminution of the &s;ick, for the deaths continued for a week afterwards to be numerous, but they were of per&s;ons who had been confined before, or on the day in which the change had taken place in the weather.</P>
<P>The appearance of this rain was like a dove with an olive branch in its mouth, to the whole city. Public notice was given of its beneficial effects in a letter &s;ub&s;cribed by the mayor, of Phi|ladelphia, who acted as pre&s;ident of the commit|tee, to the mayor of New York. I &s;hall in&s;ert the whole of this letter. It contains, be&s;ides the above information, a record of the liberality of that city, to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed inhabitants of Phila|delphia.</P>

It is no new thing for bilious fevers of every de&s;cription, to be checked, or &s;ubdued by <HI>wet</HI> and <HI>cold</HI> weather.</P>
<P>The yellow fever which raged in Philadelphia in 1699, and which is taken notice of by Thomas Story in his Journal, cea&s;ed about the latter end of October, or the beginning of November. Of this there are &s;atisfactory proofs in the regi&s;ter of the interments in the Friends burying-ground, and in a letter dated November 9th, Old Style, 1699, from I&s;aac Norris to one of his corre&s;pon|dents, which his grand-&s;on Mr Jo&s;eph P. Norris, politely put into my hands, with &s;everal others, which mention the di&s;ea&s;e, and all written in that memorable year in Philadelphia. The letter &s;ays, "It has plea&s;ed God to put a &s;top to our &s;ore vi|&s;itation, and town and country are now generally healthy." The &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e was checked by wet and cold weather in the year 1741. Of this there is a proof in a letter from Dr Franklin to one of his brothers, who &s;topped at Burlington, on his way from Bo&s;ton to Philadelphia on account of the fever, until he was a&s;&s;ured by the Doctor, that a thunder gu&s;t which had cooled the air, had ren|dered it &s;afe for him to come into the city<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> in the regi&s;ter of the interments in the Friend's <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> ground, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> year made its fir&s;t appearance in the month of June.

Lynford Lardner in a letter to one of his Engli&s;h friends, dated September 24, 1747, Old Style, after mentioning the prevalence of the fever in the city, &s;ays "the weather is now much cooler, and tho&s;e under the di&s;order revive. The &s;ymp|toms are le&s;s violent, and the fever gradually abates."</P>
<P>I have in vain attempted to procure an account of the time of the commencement of cold weather, in the autumn of 1762. In the &s;hort hi&s;tory of the fever of that year, which I have in&s;erted from my note book, I have &s;aid that it continued to prevail in the months of November and Decem|ber. The regi&s;ter of the interments in the Friends burying-ground in tho&s;e months, confirms that account. They were nearly as numerous in November and December, as in September and October. <ABBR>Viz.</ABBR> in September 22, in October 27, in November 19, and in December 26.</P>

<P>Sir John Pringle will furni&s;h ample &s;atisfaction, to &s;uch of my readers as wi&s;h for more proofs of the efficacy of heavy rains, and cold weather, in checking the progre&s;s and violence of autumnal remitting fevers<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 5, 56, 180, and 323.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From the 15th of October, the di&s;ea&s;e not only declined, but a&s;&s;umed more obvious inflammatory &s;ymptoms. It was, as in the beginning, more ne|ce&s;&s;arily fatal where left to it&s;elf, but it yielded more certainly to art, than it did a few weeks be|fore. The duration of it was now more tedious, than in the warmer weather.</P>
<P>There were a few ca&s;es of yellow fever in No|vember, and December, after the citizens who had retired to the country, returned to the city.</P>
<P>I heard of only three per&s;ons who returned to the city being infected with the di&s;order; &s;o com|pletely

was the contagion de&s;troyed in the cour&s;e of a few weeks.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of a proclamation by the Go|vernor, and a recommendation by the Clergy of Philadelphia, the 12th of December was ob&s;erved as a day of thank&s;giving throughout the &s;tate, for the extinction of the di&s;order in the city.</P>
<P>It was ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h in walking the &s;treets, the per&s;ons who had returned from the country to the city, from tho&s;e who had remained in it during the prevalence of the fever. The former appeared ruddy, and healthy, while the latter ap|peared of a pale or &s;allow colour.</P>
<P>It afforded a &s;ubject of equal &s;urpri&s;e and joy to behold the &s;uddenne&s;s with which the city reco|vered its former habits of bu&s;ine&s;s. In the cour&s;e of &s;ix weeks after the di&s;ea&s;e had cea&s;ed, nothing but fre&s;h graves, and the black dre&s;&s;es of many of the citizens, afforded a public tra<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the di&s;|tre&s;s which had &s;o lately prevailed in the city.</P>
<P>The month of November, and all the winter months which followed the autumnal epidemic, were in general healthy. A catarrh affected a

number of people in November. I &s;u&s;pected it to be the influenza which had revived from a dor|mant &s;tate; and which had not &s;pent it&s;elf when it yielded to the predominance of the yellow fe|ver. This opinion derives &s;ome &s;upport from a curious fact related by the late Mr Hunter of the revival of the &s;mall-pox in a patient, in whom it had been &s;u&s;pended for &s;ome time by the mea|&s;les<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Introduction to a Treati&s;e on the Venereal Di&s;ea&s;e, p. 3, of the American edition.</NOTE>. The few fevers which prevailed in the winter were highly inflammatory. The &s;mall-pox in the natural way was in &s;everal in&s;tances confluent; and in one or two fatal. I was prepared to expect this inflammatory diathe|&s;is in the fevers of the winter; for I had been taught by Dr Sydenham, that the di&s;ea&s;es which follow a great and mortal epidemic, partake more or le&s;s of its general character. But the di&s;ea&s;es of the winter had a peculiarity &s;till more extraor|dinary; and that was, many of them had &s;everal of the &s;ymptoms of the yellow fever, particularly a puking of bile, dark-coloured &s;tools, and a yel|low eye. Mr Samuel D. Alexander, a &s;tudent of medicine from South Carolina, who was &s;eized with a pneumony about Chri&s;tmas, had with a yellow eye, a dilated pupil, and a hard pul&s;e
<PB N="139" REF="027658_0146_0FD7C7FDBA3F6080">
which beat only 50 &s;trokes in a minute. His blood was &s;uch as I had frequently ob&s;erved in the yellow fever. Dr Griffitts informed me, that he attended a patient on the 9th of January in a pneumony, who had an univer&s;al yellowne&s;s on his &s;kin. I met with a ca&s;e of pneumony on the 20th of the &s;ame month, in which I ob&s;erved the &s;ame degrees of redne&s;s in the eyes that were common in the yellow fever. My pupil Mr Coxe, lo&s;t blood in an inflammatory fever, on the 18th of February, which was di&s;&s;olved. Mr James In|nis, the brewer, had a deep yellow colour in his eyes, on the fourth day of a pneumony, on the 27th of the &s;ame month; and Mr Magnus Miller had the &s;ame &s;ymptom of a &s;imilar di&s;order, on the 16th of March. None of the&s;e bilious and ano|malous &s;ymptoms of the inflammatory fevers of the winter and &s;pring &s;urpri&s;ed me. I had been ear|ly taught by Dr Sydenham, that the epidemics of autumn often in&s;inuate &s;ome of their &s;ymptoms in|to the winter di&s;ea&s;es which follow them. Dr Cleghorn informs us, that "the pleuri&s;ies which &s;ucceeded the autumnal tertians in Minorca, were accompanied by a vomiting and purging of green or yellow bilious matters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 273.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="027658_0147_0FD7CB681B02B7F8">
It belongs to powerful epidemics to be followed by &s;ome di&s;ea&s;es after they di&s;appear, as well as to run into others at their fir&s;t appearance. In the former ca&s;e it is occa&s;ioned by a peculiar &s;tate of the body, created by the epidemic con&s;titution of the air, not having been changed by the weather which &s;ucceeded it.</P>
<P>The weather in March re&s;embled that of May; while the weather in April re&s;embled that of March in common years. A ra&s;h prevailed in many families in April, accompanied in a few ca&s;es by a &s;ore throat. It was attended with an itching, a redne&s;s of the eyes, and a &s;light fever in a few in&s;tances. The &s;mall-pox by inoculation in this month was more mortal than in former years. However unimportant the&s;e facts may appear at this time, future ob&s;ervations may perhaps con|nect them with a &s;imilar con&s;titution of the air which produced our late autumnal epidemic.</P>
<P>The appearance of bilious &s;ymptoms in the di&s;|ea&s;es of the winter, excited apprehen&s;ions in &s;eve|ral in&s;tances of the revival of the yellow fever. The alarms though fal&s;e, &s;erved to produce vigi|lance and indu&s;try in the corporation, in airing and purifying &s;uch hou&s;es and articles of furniture
<PB N="141" REF="027658_0148_0FD7CB6994A52418">
as belonged to the poor; and which had been ne|glected in the autumn, after the cea&s;ing of the di&s;|ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The modes of purifying hou&s;es, beds, and clothes were various. Fumigations of nitre and aromatic &s;ub&s;tances were u&s;ed by &s;ome people. Burying infected articles of furniture under ground, and baking them in ovens, were u&s;ed by others. Some de&s;troyed all their beds and cloth|ing that had been infected, or threw them into the Delaware. Many white-wa&s;hed their walls, and painted the wood-work of their hou&s;e. Is did not conceive the contagion required all, or any of tho&s;e means to de&s;troy it. I believed <HI>cold</HI> and <HI>water</HI> to be &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e. I therefore advi&s;ed keeping the windows of infected rooms open night and day, for a few days; to have the floors and walls of hou&s;es well wa&s;hed; and to expo&s;e beds and &s;uch articles of hou&s;ehold furniture as might be injured by wa&s;hing, upon the bare earth for a week or two, taking care to turn them every day. I u&s;ed no other methods of de&s;troying the accumulated contagion in my hou&s;e and furniture, and experience &s;howed that they were &s;ufficient. Tho&s;e branches of my fa|mily who had been ab&s;ent during the prevalence of the fever (amounting to eleven in number) re|turned
<PB N="142" REF="027658_0149_0FD7CB6E481B9F60">
to the city on the 22d of November, and occupied the hou&s;e and beds which had been highly infected, without &s;uffering a moment's in|di&s;po&s;ition from it. The weather of the winter favoured the complete de&s;truction of the conta|gion. It was alternately moderate and cold; by which means the contagion, if accidentally revi|ved by the former, was more effectually de&s;troyed by the latter &s;tate of the air.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible a portion of the contagion may ex|i&s;t in clothes or bedding, under &s;uch circum&s;tan|ces of warmth, as to be excited into action in the cour&s;e of the approaching &s;ummer and autumn; but it cannot &s;pread without a corre&s;ponding con|&s;titution of the atmo&s;phere. A trunk full of in|fected clothes, the property of Mr James Bing|ham, who died of the yellow fever in one of the We&s;t India i&s;lands about 40 years ago, was open|ed &s;ome months after they were received by his friends, by a young man who lived in his bro|ther's family. This young man took the di&s;ea&s;e, and died; but without infecting any of the fami|ly: nor did the di&s;ea&s;e &s;pread afterwards in the city.</P>
<P>The father of Mr Jo&s;eph Pa&s;chall was infected with the yellow fever of 1741, by the &s;mell of a
<PB N="143" REF="027658_0150_0FD7CB6F94DD4730">
bed in pa&s;&s;ing through Norris's Alley, in the lat|ter end of December, after the di&s;ea&s;e had left the city. He died on the 25th of the month, but without reviving the fever in the city, or even in|fecting his family.</P>
<P>In a letter from Dr Senter of Newport, dated January 7th, 1794, I find the following fact, which I &s;hall communicate in his own words. It is in|troduced to &s;upport the principle, that the yellow fever cannnot &s;pread in any country without the concurrence of a predi&s;po&s;ing con&s;titution of air. "This place (&s;ays the Doctor) has traded formerly very much to the We&s;t India i&s;lands, and more or le&s;s of our people have died there every &s;ea&s;on, when the di&s;ea&s;e prevails in tho&s;e parts. Clothes of the&s;e unfortunate people have been re|peatedly brought home to their friends, without any accident happening to them."</P>
<P>It is not peculiar to the contagion of the yellow fever to require the concurrence of a morbid con&s;ti|tution of the air to excite it into action. The con|tagion of the plague peri&s;hed twice in the city of Larnica, without &s;preading, from the ab&s;ence of that nece&s;&s;ary &s;tate of the air, in the year 1759<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. Ru&s;&s;el, p. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="027658_0151_0FD7CB712E4F29E0">
Several per&s;ons it is &s;aid died of the yellow fe|ver in the &s;ummer and autumn of 1763, the year after it had been epidemic in our city. I witne&s;&s;ed the &s;ymptoms which immediately preceded the death of one of them. Whether the di&s;ea&s;e in this ca&s;e was produced by a revival of the conta|gion, or by mia&s;mata generated in the city, I am unable to determine.</P>
<P>Dr Mitchell informs us, that the di&s;ea&s;e appear|ed in Virginia in the &s;pring of 1742, after the au|tumn of 1741. In this ca&s;e the contagion was probably kept alive during the winter by the want of cleanline&s;s in the negro-quarters; and perhaps by moderate weather.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the only facts which &s;upport the fears of the return of the di&s;ea&s;e to our city, in the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent year. To aid our hopes, that this will not be the ca&s;e, I have great plea&s;ure in ad|ding, that it has never occurred in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years either in this city or in Charle&s;ton; in one of which there are records of its having been five, and in the other four times epidemic.</P>
<P>I feel with my reader the fatigue of this long detail of facts, and equal impatience with him, to proceed to the hi&s;tory of the treatment of the fe|ver;
<PB N="145" REF="027658_0152_0FD7CB7299E63020">
but I mu&s;t beg leave to detain him a little longer from that part of the work, while I re&s;ume the &s;ubject of the origin of the fever. It is an in|tere&s;ting que&s;tion, as it involves in it the means of preventing a return of the di&s;order.</P>
<P>Soon after the fever left the city, the governor of the &s;tate addre&s;&s;ed a letter to the College of Phy&s;icians, reque&s;ting to know their opinion of its origin; if imported; from what place; at what time; and in what manner. The de&s;ign of this in|quiry was to procure &s;uch information as was pro|per to lay before the legi&s;lature, in order to im|prove the laws for preventing the importation or generation of infectious di&s;ea&s;es, or to enact new ones, if nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e.

No in&s;tance has ever occurred of the di&s;ea&s;e called the <HI>yellow fever,</HI> having been generated in this city, or in any other parts of the United States, as far as we know; but there have been frequent in&s;tances of its having been imported, not only into this, but into other parts of North America, and prevailing there for a certain period of time; and from the ri&s;e, progre&s;s, and nature of the malignant fever, which began to prevail here about the beginning of la&s;t Augu&s;t, and ex|tended it&s;elf gradually over a great part of the city, we are of opinion that this di&s;ea&s;e was im|ported into Philadelphia, by &s;ome of the ve&s;&s;els which arrived in the port after the middle of July.

I am &s;orry to meet my brethren upon every que&s;|tion of our late epidemic in a field of controver&s;y. In the pre&s;ent they will have a great advantage over me, for the prejudices of the citizens of Philadel|phia are in their favour. Loath&s;ome and dangerous di&s;ea&s;es have been con&s;idered by all nations as of foreign extraction. The venereal di&s;ea&s;e and the lepro&s;y have no native country, if we believe all the authors who have written upon their origin. Pro&s;|per Alpinus, derives the almo&s;t yearly plagues of Cairo from Syria, and Dr Warren flattered the people of Barbadoes, by an attempt to per&s;uade them, that the yellow fever of the We&s;t Indies, was originally imported from Siam. This princi|ple of referring the origin of the evils of life, from our&s;elves to others, is univer&s;al. It di&s;co|vered it&s;elf in paradi&s;e, and it is every where, an e&s;&s;ential feature in the character of man.</P>
<P>I have a&s;&s;erted in the introduction to the hi&s;tory of this fever, that I believed it to have been gene|rated in our city; I &s;hall now deliver my rea&s;ons for that belief.</P>
<P N="1">1. The yellow fever in the We&s;t Indies and in all other countries where it is endemic, is the off|&s;pring of vegetable putrefaction. Heat, exerci&s;e, and intemperance in drinking, (&s;ays Dr Lind) <HI>di&s;|po&s;e</HI>

to this fever in hot climates, but they do not produce it, without the concurrence of a remote cau&s;e. This remote cau&s;e exi&s;ts at all times, in &s;ome &s;pots of the I&s;lands, but in other parts of even the &s;ame i&s;lands, where there are no mar&s;h exhalations, the di&s;ea&s;e is unknown. I &s;hall not wa&s;te a moment in enquiring into the truth of Dr Warren's account of the origin of this fever. It is fully refuted by Dr Hillary, and it is treated as chimerical by Dr Lind. They have very limited ideas of the hi&s;tory of this fever who &s;uppo&s;e it to be peculiar to the Ea&s;t or We&s;t Indies. It was generated in Cadiz after a hot and dry &s;ummer in 1764, and in Pen&s;acola in 1765<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lind on the Di&s;ea&s;es of Hot Climates, p. 36 and 124.</NOTE>.

<P N="2">2. The &s;ame cau&s;es (under like circum&s;tances) mu&s;t always produce the &s;ame effects. There is nothing in the air of the We&s;t Indies above other hot countries, which di&s;po&s;es it to produce a yel|low fever. Similar degrees of heat, acting upon

dead and moi&s;t vegetable matters, are capable of producing it, together with all its various modifi|cations, in every part of the world. In &s;upport of this opinion, I &s;hall tran&s;cribe part of a letter from Dr Miller, of the Delaware &s;tate.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Dover, <DATE><HI>Nov.</HI> 5, 1793.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE the middle of la&s;t July, we have had a Bilious Colic epidemic in this neigh|bourhood which exhibits phaenomena very &s;ingu|lar in this climate; and &s;o far as I am informed, unprecedented in the medical records, or popular traditions of this country. To avoid unnece&s;&s;ary details, it will &s;uffice at pre&s;ent to ob&s;erve, that the di&s;ea&s;e on this occa&s;ion, has a&s;&s;umed not only all the e&s;&s;ential characters, but likewi&s;e all the vio|lence, ob&s;tinacy and malignity de&s;cribed by the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indian practitioners. If any differ|ence can be ob&s;erved, it &s;eems here to manife&s;t higher degrees of &s;tubbornne&s;s and malignity, than we u&s;ually meet in the hi&s;tories of tropical wri|ters. In the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, not only ex|treme con&s;tipation, frequent vomiting, and the mo&s;t excruciating pains of the bowels and limbs, harra&s;s the unhappy patient; but to the&s;e &s;ucceed paraly&s;is, convul&s;ions, &amp;c. and almo&s;t always un|common
<PB N="150" REF="027658_0157_0FD7C8016C81FF48">
mu&s;cular debility,&mdash;oppre&s;&s;ion of the praecordia, &amp;c. are the con&s;equence of a &s;evere attack. Bile di&s;charged in enormous quantities, con&s;tantly a&s;&s;umes the mo&s;t corrupted and acri|monious appearances, commonly aeruginous in a very high degree, and &s;ometimes quite atrabilious.</P>
<P>The inference I mean to draw from the phae|nomena of this di&s;ea&s;e, as it appears in this neigh|bourhood, and which I pre&s;ume will al&s;o apply to your epidemic, is THIS, that from the uncommon protraction and inten&s;ene&s;s of our &s;ummer and autumnal heats, but principally from the unu&s;ual drought; we have had &s;ince the middle of July, a near approach to a TROPICAL &s;ea&s;on, and that of con&s;equence we ought not to be &s;urprized if tropical di&s;ea&s;es, even of the mo&s;t malignant na|ture, are ENGENDERED among&s;t us.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>To the above information it may be added, that the dy&s;entery which prevailed during the late au|tumn in &s;everal of the villages of Penn&s;ylvania, was attended with a malignity and mortality, un|known before in any part of the &s;tate. I need not pau&s;e to remark that this dy&s;entery aro&s;e from putrid exhalation, and that it is like the bilious colic, only a modification of one original genus of bilious fever.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="027658_0158_0FD7CB81C137DFD8">
But further, a malignant fever re&s;embling that which was epidemic in our city, prevailed during the autumn in many parts of the United States, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> at Lynn in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, at Weatherfield and Coventry in Connecticut, at New Galloway in the &s;tate of New York, on Walkill and on Pen&s;ocken creeks in New Jer&s;ey, at Harri&s;burgh, and Hum|mel&s;town in Penn&s;ylvania, in Caroline country in Maryland, on the South branch of the Potowmac in Hardie county, al&s;o in Lynchburgh and in Alexandria in Virginia, and in &s;everal counties in North Carolina. In none of the&s;e places was there a &s;u&s;picion of the di&s;ea&s;e being imported from abroad, or conveyed by an intercour&s;e with the city of Philadelphia.</P>
<P>It is no objection to the inference which follows from the&s;e facts, that the common remitting fever was not known during the above period in the neighbourhood of this city, and in many other parts of the &s;tate, where it had u&s;ually appeared in the autumnal months. There is a certain combination of moi&s;ture with heat, which is e&s;&s;ential to the production of the remote cau&s;e of a bilious fever. Where the heat is &s;o inten&s;e, or of &s;uch long du|ration as wholly to di&s;&s;ipate moi&s;ture, or when the rains are &s;o great as totally to overflow the
<PB N="152" REF="027658_0159_0FD7CB838D5AA7C8">
mar&s;hy ground, or to wa&s;h away putrid ma&s;&s;es of matter, no fever can be produced.</P>
<P>Dr Dazilles, in his treati&s;e upon the di&s;ea&s;es of the Negroes in the We&s;t Indies, informs us, that the RAINY &s;ea&s;on is the mo&s;t healthy at Cayenne, owing to the neighbouring mora&s;&s;es being DEEPLY overflowed&mdash;whereas at St Domingo, a DRY &s;ea|&s;on is mo&s;t productive of di&s;ea&s;es; owing to its favouring tho&s;e degrees of moi&s;ture which pro|duce morbid exhalations. The&s;e facts will explain the rea&s;on why, in certain &s;ea&s;ons, places which are naturally healthy in our country, become &s;ickly, while tho&s;e places which are naturally &s;ickly, e&s;cape the prevailing epidemic. Previou&s;ly to the di&s;&s;ipation of the moi&s;ture from the putrid ma&s;&s;es of vegetable matters in our &s;treets, and in the neighbourhood of the city, there were (as &s;everal practitioners can te&s;tify) many ca&s;es of mild remit|tents, but they all di&s;appeared about the fir&s;t week in September.</P>
<P>It is worthy of notice, that the yellow fever pre|vailed in Virginia in the year 1741, and in Charle&s;|ton in South Carolina in the year 1699, in both which years, it prevailed in Philadelphia. Its pre|valence in Charle&s;ton is taken notice of in a
<PB N="153" REF="027658_0160_0FD7C803D213F1E8">
letter dated November 18th, O. S. 1699, from I&s;aac Norris to one of his corre&s;pondents. The letter &s;ays, that "150 per&s;ons had died in Charle&s;|ton in a few days," that "the &s;urvivors fled into the country," and that "the town was thinned to a very few people." Is it not probable, from the prevalence of this fever twice in two places in the &s;ame years, that it was produced (as la&s;t year) by a general con&s;titution of air, co-operating with mia&s;mata, which favoured its generation in differ|ent parts of the continent? But again, &s;uch was the &s;tate of the air in the &s;ummer of 1793, that it predi&s;po&s;ed other animals to di&s;ea&s;es, be&s;ides the human &s;pecies. In &s;ome parts of New Jer&s;ey, a di&s;order prevailed with great mortality among the hor&s;es, and in Virginia among the cows, during the la&s;t autumn. The urine in both was yellow.&mdash;Large ab&s;ce&s;&s;es appeared in different parts of the body in the latter animals, which when opened, di&s;charged a yellow &s;erous fluid. From the colour of the&s;e di&s;charges, and of the urine, the di&s;ea&s;e got the name of the <HI>yellow water.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. I have before remarked that a quantity of damaged coffee, was expo&s;ed at a time (July the 24th) and in a &s;ituation (on a wharf, and in a dock) which favoured its putrefac|tion, and exhalation. Its &s;mell was highly pu|trid
<PB N="154" REF="027658_0161_0FD7CB8494E3FDF0">
and offen&s;ive, in&s;omuch that the inhabitants of the hou&s;es in Water and Front Streets, who were near it, were obliged in the hotte&s;t weather to exclude it, by &s;hutting their doors and windows. Even per&s;ons, who only walked-along tho&s;e &s;treets, complained of an intolerable foetor, which upon enquiring, was con&s;tantly traced to the putrid cof|fee. It &s;hould not &s;urpri&s;e us, that this &s;eed, &s;o inoffen&s;ive in its natural &s;tate, &s;hould produce, af|ter its putrefaction a violent fever. The records of medicine furni&s;h in&s;tances of &s;imilar fevers be|ing produced, by the putrefaction of many other vegetable &s;ub&s;tances. Fourteen men out of &s;ix|teen, peri&s;hed by a malignant fever, a few years ago, at the i&s;land of Tortola, from the effluvia ge|nerated by &s;ome putrefied potatoes, which were taken out of the hold of a Liverpool ve&s;&s;el. "The effluvia (&s;ays Dr Zimmerman) from a little heap of flax, has been known to occa&s;ion a malig|nant fever, which proved fatal to the family, in which it fir&s;t began, and afterwards &s;pread its <HI>Con|tagion</HI> through a whole country." Dr Rodgers in his treati&s;e upon the di&s;ea&s;es of Cork, mentions a malignant fever which &s;wept away a great num|ber of the &s;tudents of Wadham College in Ox|ford, "The &s;ingularity of the ca&s;e (adds the Doc|tor) engaged all the gentlemen of the faculty, in a &s;erious inquiry into the cau&s;es of &s;o remarkable
<PB N="155" REF="027658_0162_0FD7CB8635FA86F8">
an effect, and all agreed that the <HI>contagious</HI> infec|tion aro&s;e from the putrefaction of a va&s;t quantity of cabbages thrown into a heap out of the &s;everal gardens near the College." Lanci&s;&s;i relates, that one end of the city of Rome was nearly de&s;olated by the effluvia of &s;ome rotted hemp, which lay in the neighbourhood of the city. The &s;ame author remarks, that "fevers often prevail at Con&s;tanti|nople, which owe their origin to the hemp which is brought from Cairo, and which is put wet into the public granaries, and &s;uffered to ferment du|ring the &s;ummer. It is afterwards &s;old, and the &s;eeds of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are afterwards &s;pread among the people." Many other facts might be adduced of radi&s;hes, turnips, garlic, and &s;undry other vegetables, generating by putrefaction, fe|vers, &s;imilar to tho&s;e which have been mentioned.</P>
<P N="4">4. The rapid progre&s;s of the fever from Water-&s;treet, and the cour&s;es through which it travelled into other parts of the city, afford a &s;trong evi|dence that it was at fir&s;t propagated chiefly by ex|halation from the putrid coffee. It is remarkable that it pa&s;&s;ed fir&s;t through tho&s;e alleys, and &s;treets which were in the cour&s;e of the winds that blew acro&s;s the dock and wharf where the coffee lay, and that per&s;ons were affected at a much greater di&s;tance from Water-&s;treet by that means, than
<PB N="156" REF="027658_0163_0FD7C80B6EE7F328">
was afterwards known by means of the contagion which was generated by infected per&s;ons.</P>
<P N="5">5. Many per&s;ons who had worked, or even vi|&s;ited in the neighbourhood of the exhalation from the coffee, early in the month of Augu&s;t, were indi&s;po&s;ed afterwards with &s;ickne&s;s, puking, and yellow &s;weats, long before the air of Water-&s;treet was &s;o much impregnated with the contagion, as to produce &s;uch effects; and &s;everal patients whom I attended in the yellow fever declared to me, or to their friends, that their indi&s;po&s;itions began ex|actly at the time they inhaled the offen&s;ive effluvia of the coffee.</P>
<P N="6">6. The fir&s;t ca&s;es of the yellow fever have been clearly traced to the &s;ailors of the ve&s;&s;el who were fir&s;t expo&s;ed to the effluvia of the coffee. Their &s;ickne&s;s commenced with the day on which the coffee began to emit its putrid &s;mell. The di&s;ea&s;e &s;pread with the encrea&s;e of the poi&s;onous exhala|tion. A journeyman of Mr Peter Brown's, who worked near the corner of Race and Water-&s;treets, caught the di&s;ea&s;e on the 27th of July. Elizabeth Hill, the wife of a fi&s;herman was infected by only &s;ailing near the pe&s;tilential wharf, about the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, and died at Ken&s;ington on the 14th of the &s;ame month. Many other names might be
<PB N="157" REF="027658_0164_0FD7CB8A2DB460E0">
mentioned of per&s;ons who &s;ickened during the la&s;t week in July or the fir&s;t week in Augu&s;t, who a&s;cribed their illne&s;&s;es to the &s;mell of the coffee. From three of tho&s;e per&s;ons who came under my notice, the di&s;ea&s;e was evidently propagated by contagion: from one of them, to nearly a whole family, and from another to a girl of eight years old, who was led by curio&s;ity to examine the yel|low colour which it was &s;aid had appeared in the face of the infected per&s;on, after death.</P>
<P N="7">7. It has been remarked that this fever did not &s;pread in the country, when carried there by per|&s;ons who were infected, and who afterwards died with it. This I conceive was occa&s;ioned, in part by the contagion being deprived of the aid of mi|a&s;mata from the putrid matter which fir&s;t produced it in our city, and in part, by its being diluted, and thereby weakened by the pure air of the coun|try. During four times in which it prevailed in Charle&s;ton, in no one in&s;tance, according to Dr Lining, was it propagated in any other part of the &s;tate.</P>
<P N="8">8. It is very remarkable that in the hi&s;tories of the di&s;order which have been pre&s;erved in this country, it has <HI>&s;ix</HI> times appeared about the fir&s;t
<PB N="158" REF="027658_0165_0FD7CB8BA11792A8">
or middle of Augu&s;t, and declined, or cea&s;ed about the middle of October&mdash;<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> in 1732, 1739, 1745, and 1748 in Charle&s;ton; in 1791 in New-York, and in 1793 in Philadelphia. This fre|quent occurrence of the yellow fever at the u&s;ual period of our common bilious remittents, cannot be a&s;cribed to accidental coincidence, but mu&s;t be re&s;olved in mo&s;t ca&s;es into the combination of more active mia&s;mata with the predi&s;po&s;ition of a tropi|cal &s;ea&s;on. In &s;peaking of a tropical &s;ea&s;on, I include that kind of weather in which rains and heats are alternated with each other, as well as that, which is uniformly warm.</P>
<P N="9">9. Several circum&s;tances attended the late epi|demic, which do not occur in the We&s;t-India yel|low fever. It affected children as well as adults in common with our annual bilious fevers. In the We&s;t Indies Dr Hume tells us it never attack|ed any per&s;on under puberty. It had, moreover, many peculiar &s;ymptoms (as I have already &s;hewn) which are not to be met with in any of the hi&s;to|ries of the We&s;t-India yellow fever.</P>
<P N="10">10. Why &s;hould it &s;urpri&s;e us to &s;ee a yellow fever generated among&s;t us? It is only a higher grade of a fever which prevails every year in
<PB N="159" REF="027658_0166_0FD7CB8D2BD2A0C0">
our city, from vegetable putrefaction. It con|forms in the difference of its degrees of violence, and danger to &s;ea&s;on, as well as climate, and in this re&s;pect it is upon a footing with the &s;mall-pox, the mea&s;les, the fore-throat, and &s;everal other di&s;|ea&s;es. There are few years pa&s;s, in which a ple|thoric habit, and more active but limited mia&s;|mata, do not produce Sporadic Ca&s;es of true yel|low fever in Philadelphia. It is very common in South and North Carolina and in Virginia, and there are facts which prove, that not only &s;trangers, but native individuals, and in one in&s;tance, a whole family, have been carried off by it in the &s;tate of Maryland. It proved fatal to one hundred per|&s;ons in the city of New-York in the year of 1791, where it was evidently generated by putrid exha|lation. The yellow colour of the &s;kin, has unfor|tunately too often been con&s;idered as the charac|teri&s;tic mark of this fever, otherwi&s;e many other in&s;tances of its prevalence might be di&s;covered, I have no doubt in every part of the United States. I wi&s;h with Dr Mo&s;ely, the term <HI>yellow,</HI> could be aboli&s;hed from the titles of this fever, for this co|lour is not only frequently ab&s;ent, but &s;ometimes occurs in the milde&s;t bilious remittents. Dr Hal|ler in his pathology, de&s;cribes an epidemic of this kind in Swi&s;&s;erland, in which this colour generally attended, and I have once &s;een it almo&s;t univer&s;al
<PB N="160" REF="027658_0167_0FD7CB8E55F2F138">
in a common bilious fever which prevailed in the American army in the year 1776.</P>
<P>If any thing could &s;urpri&s;e me after reading the report of the College of Phy&s;icians that our late fever was imported, in &s;pite of every po&s;&s;ible evi|dence to the contrary, it would be the opinion which was delivered publicly by &s;ome leading members of the College, that no fever produced by vegetable putrefaction and exhalation, had ever been contagious. It is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to open a practical book upon medicine, without meeting with facts which e&s;tabli&s;h a contrary opinion. The fevers generated by putrid cabbage, men|tioned by Dr Rodgers, and by putrid flax men|tioned by Dr Zimmerman, were both contagious. Dr Lind a&s;cribes the yellow fever every where to mar&s;h or putrid vegetable exhalations; and this fever, we know, &s;preads by contagion. Dr Lind, Jun. e&s;tabli&s;hes the contagious nature of the mar&s;h fever which prevailed in Bengal in the year 1762. I &s;hall tran&s;cribe his words upon this &s;ubject. "Although mar&s;h mia&s;mata (&s;ays he) fir&s;t bring on the di&s;ea&s;e, yet contagion pre&s;ently &s;preads it, and renders it more epidemic. Thus the Drake Indiaman continued free from the di&s;order for two weeks together, when &s;he had no commu|nication with other &s;hips; whereas as &s;oon as the
<PB N="161" REF="027658_0168_0FD7CB8FD3BC2B78">
di&s;order was brought on board, many were &s;eized with it within a few days in &s;uch a manner as to leave no room to entertain the lea&s;t doubt con|cerning its pe&s;tilential nature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 35, 36.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>Dr Clark mentions a contagious malignant fever from mar&s;h mia&s;mata, which prevailed at Prince's I&s;land in the year 1771, and which after|wards infected the crew of the Grenville India|man<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;ervations on the Di&s;ea&s;es of Long Voyages to hot countries, vol. i. p. 123, 124.</NOTE>. The contagious pe&s;tilential fever in France, &s;o accurately de&s;cribed by Riverius, was produced by an exhalation from putrid vegeta|bles, particularly hemp and flax<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">De Febre Pe&s;tilenti, vol. ii. p. 97.</NOTE>. Even inter|mittents, the mo&s;t frequent and the mo&s;t nume|rous offspring of mar&s;h exhalation, are contagi|ous. Of this there are many proofs in practical authors. Bianchi de&s;cribes an intermittent which was highly contagious at Wolfenbuttle in the year 1666<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tor. Hepat. p. 745.</NOTE>. Dr Clark mentions a number of ca&s;es in which this mild &s;pecies of fever was propagated by contagion. Dr Cleghorn has e&s;tabli&s;hed the contagious nature of intermittents by many facts. After mentioning numerous in&s;tances of their ha|ving

The United States, in common with other coun|tries, have in many places exhibited proofs of the contagious nature of fevers, produced by putrid vegetable exhalations. The yellow fever which the citizens of New York wi&s;ely admit to have been generated in their city from vegetable putre|faction in the year 1791, &s;pread by contagion<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Addoms's Inaugural Di&s;&s;ertation on the Malignant Fever which prevailed in New York, during the months of Augu&s;t, September, and October, in 1791, p. 7.</NOTE>. The bilious fever which prevailed in Philadelphia in the year 1778, was evidently contagious; &s;o were the bilious fevers which prevailed during the la&s;t autumn in Weathersfield, Harri&s;burgh, and on the &s;outh branch of the Potowmac. I hope I &s;hall be excu&s;ed by the phy&s;icians of other &s;tates (if this publication &s;hould fall into their hands) for having employed a &s;ingle page in combating an error which is &s;o obvious to common ob&s;erva|tion. My only de&s;ign in expo&s;ing it, is to prevent a repetition of its fatal influence in the only city in the world in which it has ever been believed or propagated.</P>

I am far however from denying that this di&s;ea&s;e has not &s;ometimes been imported into our coun|try. From the authority of Dr Lind, it appears that this has once been the ca&s;e in Philadelphia. In this re&s;pect it is upon a footing with the plague, which is both an imported and a generated di&s;|ea&s;e, in the cities of the Ea&s;t. I am di&s;po&s;ed how|ever to believe that the in&s;tances of the yellow fe|ver being imported are very few, compared with tho&s;e of its being generated in our country. What makes this opinion probable is, that neither Great Britain nor Ireland have ever, to my knowledge, been infected by this fever, notwith&s;tanding their long and frequent commercial intercour&s;e with the We&s;t India i&s;lands. The &s;ummers in each of tho&s;e countries, though &s;eldom <HI>hot</HI> enough to generate a contagious yellow or bilious fever, are notwith|&s;tanding <HI>warm</HI> enough to favour the propagation of an imported contagion of that di&s;order. The jail fever which has more than once been introdu|ced into our city in crowded &s;hips from Holland, I &s;u&s;pect has been &s;ometimes mi&s;taken for the yel|low fever of the We&s;t Indies. But I have ano|ther rea&s;on for di&s;crediting &s;ome of the accounts of the importation of this fever, which have been handed down to us by former generations, and that is, the manner in which the College of Phy|&s;icians decided upon the que&s;tion of the origin of
<PB N="164" REF="027658_0171_0FD7CB98441EC770">
the di&s;ea&s;e now under con&s;ideration. The go|vernor of the &s;tate reque&s;ted in his letter to them, to know whether it was imported; if it were, from what <HI>place,</HI> at <HI>what time,</HI> and in <HI>what man|ner.</HI> The report of the College of Phy&s;icians takes no notice of either of tho&s;e que&s;tions. In vain did Dr Foulke call upon the college to be more definite in their an&s;wer to the governor's letter. They had faithfully &s;ought for the infor|mation required, but to no purpo&s;e. The cha|racter of their departed brother Dr Hutchin&s;on, for capacity and vigilance in his office, as in&s;pec|tor of &s;ickly ve&s;&s;els, was urged without effect as an argument again&s;t the probability of the di&s;ea&s;e being imported. Public report had derived it from &s;everal different i&s;lands; had cha&s;ed it from &s;hip to &s;hip, and from &s;hore to &s;hore; and finally conveyed it at different times into the city, al|ternately by dead and living bodies; and from the&s;e tales, all of which when inve&s;tigated, were proved to be without foundation, the College of Phy&s;icians compo&s;ed their letter. It would &s;eem from this conduct of the College as if medi|cal &s;uper&s;tition had changed its names, and that in accounting for the origin of pe&s;tilential fevers, ce|le&s;tial, planetary, and demoniacal influence, has only yielded to the term&mdash;<HI>importation.</HI></P>

Let not the reader reject the opinion I have de|livered, becau&s;e it is oppo&s;ed by &s;o great a majo|rity of the phy&s;icians of Philadelphia. A &s;ingle phy&s;ician &s;upported an opinion of the exi&s;tence of the plague at Me&s;&s;ina in the year 1743, in oppo|&s;ition to all the phy&s;icians (33 in number) of that city. They denied the di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion to exi&s;t, becau&s;e it was not accompanied by glandular &s;wel|lings. Time &s;hewed that they were all mi&s;taken, and the plague, which might probably have been checked at its fir&s;t appearance by their united ef|forts, was by means of their ignorance, introdu|ced with great mortality into every part of the city. This di&s;po&s;ition of phy&s;icians to limit the &s;ymptoms of &s;everal other di&s;ea&s;es, cannot be &s;uf|ficiently lamented. The frequent ab&s;ence of a yellow colour in our late epidemic, led to mi&s;takes which co&s;t the city of Philadelphia &s;everal hun|dred lives.</P>
<P>The report of the College of Phy&s;icians has &s;erved to confirm me in an opinion, that the plagues which occa&s;ionally de&s;olated mo&s;t of the countries in Europe in former centuries, and which were always &s;aid to be of foreign extraction, were in mo&s;t in&s;tances of dome&s;tic origin. Between the years 1006 and 1680, and plague was epidemic 52 times all over Europe. It prevailed 14 times in
<PB N="166" REF="027658_0173_0FD7C80C66ADA450">
14th century. The &s;tate of Europe in this long period, is well known. Idlene&s;s, a deficiency of vegetable aliment, a camp life from the frequency of wars, famine, an uncultivated and mar&s;hy &s;oil, &s;mall cabins, and the want of cleanline&s;s in dre&s;s, diet, and furniture, all concurred to generate pe&s;|tilential di&s;ea&s;es. The plagues which prevailed in London every year from 1593 to 1611, and from 1636 to 1649, I &s;u&s;pect were generated in that city. The diminution of plagues in Europe, more e&s;pecially in London, appears to have been produced by the great change in the diet and man|ners of the people; al&s;o by the more commodious and airy forms of the hou&s;es of the poor, among whom the plague <HI>always</HI> makes its fir&s;t appear|ance. It is true, the&s;e plagues were &s;aid by au|thors to have been imported either directly or in|directly from the Levant; but the proofs of &s;uch importation were in mo&s;t ca&s;es as vague and defi|cient, as they were of the We&s;t India origin of our late epidemic. The pe&s;tilential fevers which have been mentioned, have been de&s;cribed by au|thors, by the generic name of the plague; but &s;ome of them appear to have originated from pu|trid vegetable exhalations, and to have re&s;embled in mo&s;t of their &s;ymptoms, the We&s;t India and <HI>North American</HI> yellow fever.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="027658_0174_0FD7CB9D8929C3A0">
I am aware that the opinion and facts which I have &s;tated upon the origin of the late epidemic, are not popular with our citizens, but I did not dare to conceal them; for I am per&s;uaded a know|ledge and belief of them, involve in their con&s;e|quences, the lives of millions that are yet unborn.</P>
<P>Commerce can no more be endangered than Re|ligion, by the publication of philo&s;ophical truth. On the contrary it mu&s;t &s;uffer mo&s;t by the adop|tion of the traditional error which I have endea|voured to refute, for while the cau&s;e of a malig|nant fever is obvious to the &s;en&s;es, it will be ea&s;y to guard again&s;t it; but while it is believed that the di&s;ea&s;e may be imported, and no body know, from what <HI>place,</HI> at what <HI>time,</HI> and in <HI>what man|ner,</HI> we &s;hall not only be carele&s;s in the mid&s;t of filth and danger, but our city will always hold its character for health by a timid and precarious te|nure. I am the more di&s;po&s;ed to expect forgive|ne&s;s from my fellow citizens for this attempt to &s;erve them, by the recollection of the &s;udden change in the health of our city which followed the arching the offen&s;ive dock between Front and Third &s;treets in the year 1782. By advi&s;ing that mea&s;ure (in which I &s;tood nearly alone) I incurred the cen&s;ure of &s;everal valuable citizens. The bills of mortality however &s;oon &s;hewed that the mea|&s;ure
<PB N="168" REF="027658_0175_0FD7CB9ED4560E00">
was right, and I have &s;ince &s;een with great plea&s;ure the extraordinary healthine&s;s of our city, a&s;cribed by indifferent people, to that, among other cau&s;es.</P>
<P>The climate of our country can no more &s;uffer than the commerce of our city, by this inve&s;tiga|tion; for it fixes the late fever, and all the other malignant fevers of the United States, upon putrid vegetable exhalation. Without the matrix of putrid vegetable matters, there can no more be a bilious or yellow fever generated among&s;t us, than there can be vegetation without earth&mdash;water or air. To a&s;cribe our late di&s;ea&s;e therefore to the exclu&s;ive influence of the atmo&s;phere, is a reflec|tion upon our climate which is equally unphilo&s;o|phical and unju&s;t.</P>
<P>Let it only be clearly proved, and boldly a&s;&s;ert|ed, that a bilious yellow fever has been, and may be generated in our country, under the circum|&s;tances before mentioned, and the return of it, as al&s;o of common bilious and intermitting fevers may every where be prevented by a due attention to the cleanline&s;s of the wharfs and &s;uburbs, as well as the &s;treets of our cities, and towns; by draining and cultivating mar&s;hy grounds in their neighbourhood, and in the neighbourhood of
<PB N="169" REF="027658_0176_0FD7CBA117EE4C08">
farm hou&s;es,&mdash;and where the la&s;t cannot be done, by &s;heltering them from the current of vegetable exhalations, by means of a body of trees that are of &s;peedy growth. In this manner, malignant and deadly fevers have been bani&s;hed from mo&s;t of the cities in Europe.</P>
<P>I have hinted in the cour&s;e of this hi&s;tory, at the re&s;emblance which the yellow fever bears to the plague. Before I di&s;mi&s;s this part of my &s;ub|ject, I &s;hall briefly enumerate the circum&s;tances, and &s;ymptoms, which belong to them in common; and afterwards mention tho&s;e which are peculiar to each of them. The utility of this digre&s;&s;ion will, I hope appear hereafter, when I come to deli|ver the hi&s;tory of the <HI>cure</HI> of the yellow fever.&mdash;The principles which &s;ugge&s;ted and directed it, will apply alike to both di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances and &s;ymptoms in which the plague, and the yellow fever (as it lately appeared in our city) re&s;emble each other, are as follow:</P>
<P>In being accompanied and encrea&s;ed by warm weather.</P>
<P>In affecting tho&s;e people mo&s;t generally who fol|low occupations which expo&s;e them to be much

heated. The bakers were great &s;ufferers by the plagues at Aleppo, de&s;cribed by Dr P. Ru&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>In affecting per&s;ons who are &s;uddenly debili|tated by fear or grief.</P>
<P>In affecting all ages; al&s;o the poor more than the rich; men more than women; and per&s;ons of robu&s;t, more than tho&s;e of weakly habits.</P>
<P>In attacking with, and without premonitory &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>In being excited by intemperance, and labour.</P>
<P>In being accompanied by a full, ten&s;e, depre&s;&s;ed, regular, or an intermitting pul&s;e.</P>
<P>In being accompanied by hemorrhagies. The&s;e are le&s;s frequent in the plague than in the yellow fever.&mdash;Abortions are alike common in both di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>The following &s;ymptoms of our late yellow fever occur likewi&s;e in the plague.</P>
<P>Inflammation of the brain.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="027658_0178_0FD7C811DDA81250">
Inflammation, mortifications, and carbuncles in the alimentary canal and &s;tomach.</P>
<P>Co&s;tivene&s;s or diarrhoea. Copious &s;weats in the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e which afford relief.&mdash;A di&s;charge of a blacki&s;h liquor from the &s;tomach by vomiting, in the clo&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>A moi&s;t white tongue, in its beginning, and a dry black tongue in its la&s;t &s;tage.</P>
<P>Ab&s;ence of heat and thir&s;t in &s;ome ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Convul&s;ions, &s;yncope, great depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, exqui&s;ite pain, &s;o as to excite &s;creamings in the &s;ick. Delirium and a temporary lo&s;s of memory after recovery.</P>
<P>A red or a brilliant eye, and great venereal ex|citability in the convale&s;cent &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>

Sizy, den&s;e, or di&s;&s;olved blood.</P>
<P>The plague appears in the forms of quotidian, tertian, and quartan fevers. It has different grades, al&s;o different durations, from one day to two, three and four weeks. It is mo&s;t fatal at its fir&s;t appearance. Convul&s;ive twitchings of the tendons are le&s;s common in the plague, than in the nervous fever. It cha&s;es away, or unites with all other febrile di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>I have before remarked, that during the pre|valence of the plague, &s;ome foreigners e&s;cape the contagion.</P>
<P>The contagion of the plague infects the atmo&s;|phere of a whole city, and is propagated without contact with the &s;ick. Many people di&s;cover marks of the pre&s;ence of this contagion in their bodies, who are in apparent good health; a di&s;|po&s;ition to &s;weat is very common in &s;uch per&s;ons. The di&s;ea&s;e is &s;ometimes propagated by contact by means of this &s;weat, when it affects the hands.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons infected with the contagion of the plague, communicate it before they are &s;en&s;ible of their being affected by it. The contagion is excited at different times, from the moment it is
<PB N="173" REF="027658_0180_0FD7CBA601883E10">
received into the body, until the 16th day after|wards.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons who have had the plague, are capable of re-infection.</P>
<P>Brutes, as cats and dogs are affected in &s;ome in&s;tances, with &s;ymptoms of the plague, particu|larly buboes.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons confined in Seraglios in Ea&s;tern coun|tries, and in Mona&s;teries in Catholic countries, al&s;o grave diggers, very often e&s;cape the plague.</P>
<P>The bodies of per&s;ons who die of the plague become &s;tiff in &s;ome in&s;tances immediately after death. Tears likewi&s;e often appear on their cheeks.</P>
<P>Cold weather checks the plague, but not &s;o uniformly as it does the yellow fever.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;es which &s;ucceed the plague, appear with more or le&s;s of its &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>It will appear hereafter that the cure of the yellow fever, accorded in &s;everal particulars, with that of the plague.</P>

The circum&s;tances and &s;ymptoms in which the plague <HI>differs</HI> from the yellow fever are as follow:</P>
<P>A vomiting is le&s;s common in the plague, than in the yellow fever. Bile is le&s;s frequently di&s;|charged, and the &s;tools are le&s;s foetid, and offen&s;ive.</P>
<P>There are &s;mall horny &s;wellings upon the brea&s;t and limbs in the plague which did not occur in the yellow fever. They are called <HI>tokens.</HI></P>
<P>The contagion of the plague does not infect as &s;o great a di&s;tance, as the contagion of the yel|low fever.</P>
<P>It affects more univer&s;ally, than the yellow fe|ver, and (with a few exceptions) it is more mor|tal when left to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>It &s;ometimes prevails in cold weather. It pre|vails likewi&s;e in a greater variety of &s;tates of the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>The body is of its u&s;ual, or of a greeni&s;h co|lour after death.</P>
<P>The plague is of animal origin. It is derived in &s;ome in&s;tances from dead animal matters. The

plagues which laid wa&s;te the Roman Empire in the reign of Ju&s;tinian, are a&s;cribed by Mr Gib|bon, to &s;warms of putrifying locu&s;ts. But the mo&s;t frequent &s;ource of the plague is from human mia&s;mata, rendered pe&s;tilential, by famine, grief, the want of cleanline&s;s, and by a number of per|&s;ons crouded together in &s;mall rooms, or hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The yellow fever has been confounded with the jail or ho&s;pital fever. I &s;hall briefly enume|rate the circum&s;tances and &s;ymptoms in which they agree and di&s;agree.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> are as follow:</P>
<P>The jail-fever affects per&s;ons who are debilita|ted by grief, fear, or intemperance.</P>
<P>The pul&s;e is &s;ometimes intermitting in this fe|ver. This is taken notice of by Dr Ferriar.</P>
<P>There are marks of conge&s;tion in the brain, without any &s;igns of inflammation in it after death. There are likewi&s;e in this fever great depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, &s;ighing, delirium, pal&s;y, and a debilita|ted &s;tate of the memory after recovery. This occurs more frequently, and in a greater degree, after the jail, than after the yellow fever.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="027658_0183_0FD7CBAA5607C158">
The eye is &s;ometimes red, and &s;ometimes dull in this fever. There is frequently an ab&s;ence of thir&s;t.</P>

<P>It is le&s;s contagious and mortal than the yellow fever.</P>
<P>It is derived from human mia&s;mata produced under inferior degrees of all tho&s;e circum&s;tances, which favour the generation of the plague. It is, to the plague in its degree, what the common bilious, is, to the yellow fever.</P>

<P>In contemplating the immen&s;e proportion of human mi&s;ery, which is produced by pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, we are naturally led to inquire whether their approaches are not indicated by &s;ome un|u&s;ual &s;igns in the operations of nature.

<P>I have endeavoured to di&s;cover whether any thing uncommon occurred in the operations of na|ture in the atmo&s;phere, or in the animal and ve|getable kingdoms in the cour&s;e of the winter and &s;ummer, which preceded our late epidemic. The re&s;ult of my inquiries is as follows.</P>
<P>The winter of 1793 was unu&s;ually moderate. It was &s;uppo&s;ed this had an influence upon the weather which favoured the generation and pro|pagation
<PB N="180" REF="027658_0187_0FD7CBB3175822A0">
of the di&s;ea&s;e. I &s;hould have been di&s;|po&s;ed to admit this opinion, had moderate winters in Penn&s;ylvania been uniformly &s;ucceeded by &s;ick|ly autumns. Livy records that a pe&s;tilential fever in Rome was preceded by an unu&s;ually <HI>cold</HI> win|ter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Riverius vol. ii. p. 98.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The wild pidgeons were common during the winter of 1793 in many parts of Penn&s;ylvania. But they have occa&s;ionally appeared in great &s;tocks in our &s;tate in former winters, without ha|ving been the harbingers of a &s;ickly autumn.</P>
<P>Dr P. Ru&s;&s;el &s;ays, that uncommon and violent di&s;ea&s;es generally preceded the plague at Aleppo. Dr Sydenham informs us, that acute inflammatory fevers were the forerunners of the plague in Lon|don in 1665. I &s;u&s;pect that uncommon circum|&s;tances attending certain di&s;ea&s;es, either as to their violence or time of appearance, will be found to &s;ugge&s;t a prelude to a &s;ickly autumn in all coun|tries. The &s;carlatina angino&s;a I have remarked was attended with an uncommon degree of inflam|matory diathe&s;is, in the month of July. Dr Por|ter informed me that he had been called to &s;eve|ral ca&s;es of dy&s;entery, attended with &s;ymptoms of
<PB N="181" REF="027658_0188_0FD7CBB4A3FBCEA8">
great malignity, in the neighbourhood of Frank|fort, in the months of July and Augu&s;t. Dr Sen|ter informed me in a letter dated the 26th of No|vember, 1793, that "during the la&s;t two &s;ummer months, fevers and fluxes were more ob&s;tinate than he had ever known them, at Newport in Rhode I&s;land." My pupil Mr Nathaniel Potter, in a letter from Caroline county, in Maryland, dated November 1&s;t, 1793, gave me the follow|ing information. "On my arrival at this place, on the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, I was informed by gentle|men of the faculty, that the dy&s;entery had pre|vailed from the fir&s;t of June to the fifteenth of July, with con&s;iderable mortality. From ob&s;er|vations and communications from different peo|ple in this county, I did not he&s;itate to predict a &s;ickly autumn; for it is an invariable maxim here, both among phy&s;icians and farmers, that if the wheat be damaged by ru&s;t or bla&s;t, a contagi|ous dy&s;entery is &s;oon to follow; and the &s;ooner in the &s;ummer the dy&s;entery appears, the more violent and mortal will be the di&s;ea&s;es of the autumn."</P>
<P>The&s;e communications, though &s;hort and few, will be u&s;eful if they &s;erve to lead phy&s;icians to ob&s;erve and record hereafter the di&s;ea&s;es which precede univer&s;al and mortal epidemics.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="027658_0189_0FD7C7CE26622818">
There can be no doubt of a warm &s;ummer, whether it be wet or dry, having often preceded malignant autumnal fevers. Mr Norris in a let|ter to one of his friends, dated the 24th of Au|gu&s;t, O. S. &s;ays that "the &s;ummer of 1699 was the hotte&s;t he had ever felt, and that &s;everal had died in the harve&s;t fields with the violence of the heat." It appears from another of Mr Norris's letters, dated the 12th of Augu&s;t, O. S. that the yellow fever made its fir&s;t appearance in that month. The yellow fevers of 1762 and 1793, were both preceded by warm &s;ummers.</P>
<P>I have one more remark to mention upon this &s;ubject, which was communicated to me by a gen|tleman who had re&s;ided occa&s;ionally in &s;outhern and tropical countries. He informed me that he had ob&s;erved in the month of July, &s;everal weeks before the yellow fever became general, a pecu|liar and univer&s;al allowne&s;s of complexion in the faces of the citizens of Philadelphia, &s;uch as he had ob&s;erved to precede the prevalence of malig|nant bilious fevers in hot climates. Dr Dick in|formed me that he had ob&s;erved the &s;ame appear|ance in the faces of people in Alexandria, accom|panied in &s;ome ca&s;es by a yellowne&s;s in the eyes, during the la&s;t &s;ummer, and &s;ome time before vio|lent
<PB N="183" REF="027658_0190_0FD7CBBC6F2EFEA8">
bilious fevers became epidemic upon the banks of the Potowmac.</P>
<P>With the&s;e ob&s;ervations I take leave of the hi&s;|tory of our late epidemic fever. A few of its &s;ymptoms which have been omitted in the hi&s;tory, will be included in the method of cure; for they were di&s;covered or produced by the remedies which were u&s;ed for that purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>IN the introduction to the hi&s;tory of the fever, I mentioned the remedies which I u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s, in &s;everal ca&s;es which occurred in the beginning of Augu&s;t. I had &s;een, and re|corded in my note book, the efficacy of gentle purges in the yellow fever of 1762; but finding them un&s;ucce&s;sful after the 20th of Augu&s;t, and ob&s;erving the di&s;ea&s;e to a&s;&s;ume uncommon &s;ymp|toms of great indirect debility, I laid them a&s;ide, and had recour&s;e to a gentle vomit of ipecacuanha on the fir&s;t day of the fever, and to the u&s;ual re|medies for exciting the action of the &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem. I gave bark in all its u&s;ual forms of in|fu&s;ion, powder, and tincture. I joined wine, brandy, and aromatics with it. I applied bli&s;ters to the limbs, neck, and head. Finding them all ineffectual, I attempted to rou&s;e the &s;y&s;tem by wrapping the whole body, agreeably to Dr
<PB N="194" REF="027658_0201_0FD7C85674529B88">
Hume's practice, in blankets dipped in warm vi|negar. To the&s;e remedies I added one more: I rubbed the right &s;ide with mercurial ointment, with a view of exciting the action of the ve&s;&s;els in the whole &s;y&s;tem, through the medium of the li|ver, which I then &s;uppo&s;ed to be principally, tho' &s;ymptomatically, affected by the di&s;ea&s;e. None of the&s;e remedies appeared to be of any &s;ervice; for although three out of thirteen recovered of tho&s;e to whom they were applied, yet I have rea&s;on to believe that they would have recovered much &s;ooner had the cure been tru&s;ted to nature. Per|plexed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by my want of &s;ucce&s;s in the treatment of this fever, I waited upon Dr Stephens, an eminent and re&s;pectable phy&s;ician from St Croix, who happened then to be in our city, and a&s;ked for &s;uch advice and information upon the &s;ubject of the di&s;ea&s;e, as his exten&s;ive practice in the We&s;t Indies would naturally &s;ug|ge&s;t. He politely informed me that he had long ago laid a&s;ide evacuations of all kinds in the yel|low fever; that they had been found to be hurt|ful, and that the di&s;ea&s;e yielded more readily to bark, wine, and above all, to the u&s;e of the cold bath. He advi&s;ed the bark to be given in large quantities by way of gly&s;ter, as well as in the u&s;ual way; and he informed me of the manner in which the cold bath &s;hould be u&s;ed, &s;o as to de|rive
<PB N="195" REF="027658_0202_0FD7C955683E0080">
the greate&s;t benefit from it. This mode of treating the yellow fever appeared to be rea&s;on|able. I had u&s;ed bark in the manner he recom|mended it in &s;everal ca&s;es of &s;poradic yellow fever with &s;ucce&s;s in former years. I had moreover the authority of &s;everal other phy&s;icians of repu|tation in its favour. Dr Cleghorn tells us, that "he &s;ometimes gave the bark when the bowels were full of vicious humours. The&s;e humours (he &s;ays) are produced by the fault of the circu|lation. The bark by bracing the &s;olids, enables them to throw off the excrementitious fluids, by the proper emunctories<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 223.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>I began the u&s;e of each of Dr Stevens's reme|dies the next day after my interview with him, with great confidence of their &s;ucce&s;s. I pre&s;cri|bed bark in large quantities; in one ca&s;e I ordered it to be injected into the bowels every four hours. I directed buckets full of cold water to be thrown frequently upon my patients. The bark was offen&s;ive to the &s;tomach, or rejected by it in every ca&s;e in which I pre&s;cribed it. The cold bath was grateful, and produced relief in &s;everal ca&s;es by inducing a moi&s;ture on the &s;kin. For a while I had hopes of benefit to my
<PB N="196" REF="027658_0203_0FD7C8577196AFD8">
patients from the u&s;e of the&s;e remedies, but in a few days, I was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to find they were not more effectual than tho&s;e I had previou&s;ly u&s;ed. Three out of four of my patients died to whom the cold bath was admini&s;tered in addition to the tonic remedies before mentioned.</P>
<P>Baffled in every attempt to &s;top the ravages of this fever, I anticipated all the numerous and complicated di&s;tre&s;&s;es in our city, which pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es have &s;o often produced in other coun|tries. The fever had a malignity, and an ob&s;tinacy which I had never before ob&s;erved in any di&s;ea&s;e, and it &s;pread with a rapidity and mortality, far beyond what it did in the year 1762. Heaven alone bore witne&s;s to the angui&s;h of my &s;oul in this awful &s;ituation. But I did not abandon a hope that the di&s;ea&s;e might yet be cured. I had long believed that good was commen&s;urate with evil, and that there does not exi&s;t a di&s;ea&s;e for which the goodne&s;s of Providence has not provi|ded a remedy. Under the impre&s;&s;ion of this be|lief, I applied my&s;elf with fre&s;h ardour to the in|ve&s;tigation of the di&s;ea&s;e before me. I ran&s;acked my library, and pored over every book that treated of the yellow fever. The re&s;ult of my re&s;earches for a while was fruitle&s;s. The accounts of the &s;ymptoms and cure of the di&s;ea&s;e by the
<PB N="197" REF="027658_0204_0FD7C9596B1079A0">
authors I con&s;ulted, were contradictory, and none of them appeared altogether applicable to the pre|vailing epidemic. Before I de&s;i&s;ted from the in|quiry to which I had devoted my&s;elf, I recollected that I had among &s;ome old papers, a manu&s;cript account of the yellow fever as it prevailed in Vir|ginia in the year 1741, which had been put into my hands by Dr Franklin, a &s;hort time before his death. I had read it formerly, and made extracts from it into my lectures upon that di&s;order. I now read it a &s;econd time. I pau&s;ed upon every &s;entence; even words in &s;ome places arre&s;ted and fixed my attention. In reading the hi&s;tory of the method of cure, I was much &s;truck with the fol|lowing pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>"It mu&s;t be remarked, that this evacuation (meaning by purges) is more nece&s;&s;ary in this, than in mo&s;t other fevers. The abdominal vi&s;cera are the parts principally affected in this di&s;ea&s;e, but by this timely evacuation, their feculent cor|ruptible contents are di&s;charged, before they cor|rupt and produce any ill effects, and their various emunctories, and &s;ecerning ve&s;&s;els are &s;et open, &s;o as to allow a free di&s;charge of their contents, and con&s;equently a &s;ecurity to the parts them|&s;elves, during the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e. By this evacuation the very minera of the di&s;ea&s;e, pro|ceeding
<PB N="198" REF="027658_0205_0FD7C859A651A970">
from the putrid mia&s;ma fermenting with the &s;alivary, bilious, and other inquiline humours of the body, is &s;ometimes eradicated by timely emptying the abdominal vi&s;cera on which it fir&s;t fixes, after which a gentle &s;weat does as it were nip it in its bud. Where the primae viae, but e&s;pecially the &s;tomach, is loaded with an offen&s;ive matter, or contracted, and convul&s;ed with the ir|ritation of its &s;timulus, there is no procuring a laudable &s;weat, till that is removed; after which a nece&s;&s;ary quantity of &s;weat breaks <HI>out of its own accord,</HI> the&s;e parts promoting it when by an ab|&s;terging medicine, they are ea&s;ed of the burden or &s;timulus which oppre&s;&s;es them."</P>
<P>"All the&s;e acute putrid fevers, ever require &s;ome evacuation to bring them to a perfect cri&s;is, and &s;olution, and that even by &s;tools, which mu&s;t be promoted by art, where nature does not do the bu&s;ine&s;s her&s;elf. On this account an <HI>ill-timed &s;crupulou&s;ne&s;s about the weakne&s;s of the body,</HI> is of bad con&s;equence in the&s;e urging circum&s;tances; for it is that which &s;eems chiefly to make evacua|tions nece&s;&s;ary, which nature ever attempts, after the humours are fit to be expelled, but is not able to accompli&s;h for the mo&s;t part in this di&s;ea&s;e; and I can affirm, that I have given a purge in this ca&s;e, when <HI>the pul&s;e has been &s;o low, that it could hardly</HI>
<PB N="199" REF="027658_0206_0FD7C95E4428B668">
be felt, and the <HI>debility extreme,</HI> yet <HI>both one, and the other</HI> have been <HI>re&s;tored by it."</HI></P>
<P>"This evacuation, mu&s;t be procured by <HI>leni|tive chologoque</HI> purges."</P>
<P>Here I pau&s;ed. A new train of ideas &s;uddenly broke in upon my mind. I believed the weak and low pul&s;e which I had ob&s;erved in this fever, to be the effect of debility of the <HI>indirect</HI> kind, but the un&s;ucce&s;sful i&s;&s;ue of purging, and even of a &s;pontaneous diarrhoea, in a patient of Dr Hutchin|&s;on's had led me not only to doubt of, but to dread its effects. My fears from this evacuation were confirmed, by the communications I had re|ceived from Dr Stevens. I had been accu&s;tomed to rai&s;ing a weak and low pul&s;e in pneumony and apoplexy, by means of blood-letting, but I had attended le&s;s to the effects of purging in produ|cing this change in the pul&s;e. Dr Mitchell in a moment di&s;&s;ipated my ignorance and fears upon this &s;ubject. I adopted his theory, and practice, and re&s;olved to follow them. It remained now only to fix upon a &s;uitable purge to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of di&s;charging the contents of the bowels. I have before de&s;cribed the &s;tate of the bile in the gall-bladder, and duodenum in an extract from the hi&s;tory of a di&s;&s;ection made by Dr
<PB N="200" REF="027658_0207_0FD7C85CA5A9F7C0">
Mitchell. I &s;u&s;pected that my want of &s;ucce&s;s in di&s;charging this bile, in &s;everal of the ca&s;es in which I attempted the cure by purging, was owing to the feeblene&s;s of my purges. I had been in the habit of occa&s;ionally purging with calomel in bilious and inflammatory fevers, and had re|commended the practice the year before in my lectures, not only from my own experience, but upon the authority of Dr Clark. I had more|over, other precedents for its u&s;e in the practice of Sir John Pringle, Dr Cleghorn, and Dr Balfour, in di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;ame cla&s;s with the yellow fever. But the&s;e were not all my vouchers for the &s;afety, and efficacy of calomel. In my attendance upon the military ho&s;pitals during the late war, I had &s;een it given combined with jalap in the bilious fever by Dr Thomas Young, a &s;enior &s;urgeon in the ho&s;pitals. His u&s;ual do&s;e, was ten grains of each of them. This was given once or twice a day, until it procured large evacuations from the bowels. For a while I remon&s;trated with the Doctor again&s;t this purge, as being di&s;propor|tioned to the violence and danger of the fever; but I was &s;oon &s;atisfied that it was as &s;afe as cre|mor tartar, or glauber's &s;alts. It was adopted by &s;everal of the &s;urgeons of the ho&s;pital, and was univer&s;ally known, and &s;ometimes pre&s;cribed, by the &s;imple name of <HI>ten</HI> and <HI>ten.</HI> This mode of
<PB N="201" REF="027658_0208_0FD7C87AE584EF48">
giving calomel occurred to me in preference to any other. The jalap appeared to be a nece&s;&s;ary addition to it, in order to quicken its pa&s;&s;age through the bowels; for calomel is &s;low in its operation, more e&s;pecially when it is given in large do&s;es. I re&s;olved after mature deliberation, to pre&s;cribe this purge. Finding ten grains of jalap in&s;ufficient to carry the calomel through the bow|els, in the rapid manner I wi&s;hed, I added fifteen grains of the former, to ten of the latter; but even this do&s;e was &s;low, and uncertain in its ope|ration. I then i&s;&s;ued three do&s;es, each con&s;i&s;ting of fifteen grains of jalap, and ten of calomel; one to be given every &s;ix hours until they procured four or five large evacuations. The effects of this powder, not only an&s;wered, but far exceeded my expectations. It perfectly cured four out of the fir&s;t five patients to whom I gave it, notwith|&s;tanding &s;ome of them were advanced &s;everal days in the di&s;order. Mr Richard Spain, a block-ma|ker, in Third-&s;treet, took eighty grains of calomel, and rather more of rhubarb and jalap mixed with it, on the two la&s;t days of Augu&s;t, and on the fir&s;t day of September. He had pa&s;&s;ed twelve hours, before I began to give him this medicine, without a pul&s;e, and with a cold &s;weat on all his limbs. His relations had given him over, and one of his neighbours complained to me, of my neglecting
<PB N="202" REF="027658_0209_0FD7C862F08134B0">
to advi&s;e them to make immediate preparations for his funeral. But in this &s;ituation, I did not de&s;pair of his recovery. Dr Mitchell's account of the effects of purging in rai&s;ing the pul&s;e, ex|citing a hope that he might be &s;aved provided his bowels could be opened. I now committed the exhibition of the purging medicine to Mr Stall, one of my pupils, who mixed it, and gave it with his own hand three or four times a day. At length, it operated and produced two copious, foetid &s;tools. His pul&s;e ro&s;e immediately afterwards, and a univer&s;al moi&s;ture on his &s;kin, &s;ucceeded the cold &s;weat on his limbs. In a few days he was out of danger, and he now lives in good health as the fir&s;t fruits of the efficacy of mercu|rial purges in the yellow fever.</P>
<P>After &s;uch a pledge of the &s;afety and &s;ucce&s;s of my new medicine, I gave it afterwards with con|fidence. I communicated the pre&s;cription to &s;uch of the practitioners as I met in the &s;treets. Some of them I found had been in the u&s;e of calomel for &s;everal days, but as they had given it in &s;mall and &s;ingle do&s;es only, and had followed it by large do&s;es of bark, wine, and laudanum, they had done little or no good with it. I imparted the pre&s;cription to the College of Phy&s;icians, on the third of September, and endeavoured to remove
<PB N="203" REF="027658_0210_0FD7C961D204A3F0">
the fears of my fellow citizens, by a&s;&s;uring them that the di&s;ea&s;e was no longer incurable. Mr Lewis, the lawyer, Dr M'llvaine, Mrs Bethel, her two &s;ons, and a &s;ervant maid, and Mr Peter Baynton's whole family, (nine in number) were &s;ome of the fir&s;t trophies of this new remedy. The credit it acquired, brought me an immen&s;e acce&s;&s;ion of bu&s;ine&s;s. It &s;till continued to be al|mo&s;t uniformly effectual in all tho&s;e which I was able to attend, either in per&s;on, or by my pupils. Dr Griffitts, Dr Say, Dr Pennington, and my former pupils who had &s;ettled in the city, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Dr Leib, Dr Porter, Dr Annan, Dr Woodhou&s;e, and Dr Mea&s;e, were among the fir&s;t phy&s;icians who adopted it. I can never forget the tran&s;port with which Dr Pennington ran acro&s;s the &s;treet, to inform me, a few days after he began to give &s;trong purges, that the di&s;ea&s;e, yielded to them in every ca&s;e. But I did not rely upon purging alone, to cure the di&s;ea&s;e. The theory of its proximate cau&s;e, which I had adopted, led me to u&s;e other remedies, to ab&s;tract exce&s;s of &s;timulus from the &s;y&s;tem. The&s;e were <HI>blood-letting, cool air, cold drinks, low diet,</HI> and <HI>applications of cold water</HI> to the body. I had bled Mrs Bradford, Mrs Leaming, and one of Mrs Palmer's &s;ons with &s;ucce&s;s, early in the month of Augu&s;t. But I had witne&s;&s;ed the bad effects of bleeding in the fir&s;t
<PB N="204" REF="027658_0211_0FD7C962A6BA2388">
week in September, in two of my patients who had been bled without my knowledge, and who appeared to have died in con&s;equence of it. I had moreover, heard of a man who had been bled on the fir&s;t day of the di&s;order, who died in twelve hours afterwards. The&s;e ca&s;es produced caution, but they did not deter me from bleeding as &s;oon as I found the di&s;ea&s;e to change its type, and in|&s;tead of tending to a cri&s;is on the third, to protract it&s;elf to a later day. I began by drawing a &s;mall quantity at a time. The appearance of the blood, and its effects upon the &s;y&s;tem, &s;atisfied me of its &s;afety and efficacy. Never before did I experi|ence &s;uch &s;ublime joy as I now felt in contemplat|ing the &s;ucce&s;s of my remedies. It repaid me for all the toils and &s;tudies of my life. The con|que&s;t of this formidable di&s;ea&s;e, was not the effect of accident, nor of the application of a &s;ingle re|medy; but, it was the triumph of a principle in medicine. The reader will not wonder at this joyful &s;tate of my mind, when I add a &s;hort extract from my note book, dated the 10th of September. "Thank God! Out of one hundred patients, whom I have vi&s;ited, or pre&s;cribed for, this day, I have lo&s;t none."</P>
<P>Being unable to comply with the numerous demands which were made upon me for the purg|ing

powders, notwith&s;tanding I had reque&s;ted my &s;i&s;ter, and two other per&s;ons to a&s;&s;i&s;t my pupils in putting them up; and finding my&s;elf unable to attend all the per&s;ons who &s;ent for me, I furni&s;hed the apothecaries with the recipe for the mercurial purges, together with a copy of the following di|rections, for giving them, and for the treatment of the di&s;order.</P>
<P>"As &s;oon as you are affected, (whether by <HI>night</HI> or day) with a pain in the head, or back, &s;ick|ne&s;s at &s;tomach, chills or fever; more e&s;pecially, if tho&s;e &s;ymptoms be accompanied by a redne&s;s, or faint yellowne&s;s in the eyes, take one of the pow|ders in a little &s;ugar and water, every &s;ix hours, until they produce four or five <HI>large</HI> evacuations from the bowels&mdash;drink plentifully of water gruel, or barley water, or chicken water, or any other mild drink that is agreeable, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the opera|tion of the phy&s;ic.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your letter to day, and &s;hall with plea&s;ure give you every information in my power re&s;pecting the malignant fever, which proves &s;o fatal among us. As I con&s;ider debility and putrefaction the alarming circum&s;tances to be attended to, and to be obviated from the earlie&s;t commencement of the di&s;ea&s;e, my method of treat|ment is in&s;tituted accordingly, and has been gene|rally &s;ucce&s;sful. I do not admini&s;ter any emetic,
<PB N="208" REF="027658_0215_0FD7C96A82271A08">
do I give a laxative, unle&s;s indicated by co&s;tive|ne&s;s, when I recommend cream of tartar or ca&s;tor oil, but prefer a cly&s;ter to either. In ca&s;e of nau|&s;ea I order a few bowls of camomile tea to be taken&punc; if the nau&s;ea continues, it is to be relieved with the &s;aline draught in a &s;tate of efferve&s;cence, elixir of vitriol, and if nece&s;&s;ary, laudanum. The &s;ickne&s;s of the &s;tomach may al&s;o be alleviated by applying mint, cloves, or any other &s;pice with wine or &s;pirits to the pit of the &s;tomach. The &s;tomach being compo&s;ed, 20 drops of elixir of vitriol are to be taken every two hours in a tea cup full of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> cold camomile tea, and if bark can be retained, two drachms of the be&s;t pale bark in &s;ub&s;tance are to be given every two hours, alter|nately with the elixir of vitriol. When an ounce of bark has been admini&s;tered in this manner, the do&s;e is to be dimini&s;hed to one drachm every two hours, as the continuance of the large do&s;es might di&s;order the &s;tomach or bowels. Should the bark prove purgative it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give 10 or 15 drops of laudanum after every &s;tool. But if the bark cannot be retained on the &s;tomach, 20 drops of elixir of vitriol are to be taken every hour, and recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to bark cly&s;ters.</P>
<P>Two ounces of bark are to be put into three half pints of boiling water, and boiled down to a
<PB N="209" REF="027658_0216_0FD7C96DE51C61A8">
pint; the decoction to be &s;trained, and to 4 ounces of the decoction we add from two to four drachms of finely powdered bark and fifty drops of lauda|num. This mixture is to be injected every four hours or oftner if the &s;ymptoms are violent. One or two gla&s;&s;es of Madeira wine may be added to each injection where the debility is great. Wine is to be given from the beginning; at fir&s;t the weaker wines &s;uch as claret and rheni&s;h; if the&s;e cannot be had, Li&s;bon or Madeira diluted with rich lemonade. The quantity is to be de|termined by the effects it produces and by the &s;tate of debility which prevails, guarding again&s;t its oc|ca&s;ioning or encrea&s;ing the heat, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and delirium. I prefer pale bark from a conviction that mo&s;t of the red bark offered for &s;ale, is adul|terated. But I place the greated dependance for the cure of the di&s;ea&s;e, on throwing cool water twice a day over the naked body. The patient is to be placed in a large empty tub, and two buckets full of water, of the temperature of about 75 or 80 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer, according to the &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere, are to be thrown over him.</P>
<P>He is then to be wiped dry and put to bed; it is commonly followed by an ea&s;y per&s;piration and is always attended with great refre&s;hment to the
<PB N="210" REF="027658_0217_0FD7C96F6C5FD148">
patient. This remedy however mu&s;t be applied from the earlie&s;t attack of the di&s;ea&s;e and conti|nued regularly through the whole cour&s;e of it. Of regimen it is needle&s;s to &s;ay much to you: ripe fruits, &s;ago with wine, and rich wine-whey are the mo&s;t proper. A &s;pacious chamber with a free circulation of air, and repeatedly changing the bed and body linen are highly nece&s;&s;ary. If the bark cly&s;ters &s;hould bring on co&s;tivene&s;s the laudanum may occa&s;ionally be omitted; if this is not attended with the de&s;ired con&s;equences, we have recour&s;e to a common injection. Sprinkling the chamber with vinegar, wa&s;hing the face, neck, hands and feet with it, and then wiping them dry, will have their u&s;e. The fumes of vinegar and of nitre will contribute much to &s;weeten the air in the chamber.</P>

In a malignant fever which prevailed at Bre&s;lau in Sile&s;ia and proved ex|tremely fatal, yielded to none of the u&s;ual reme|dies, Dr De Haehn a phy&s;ician of the place had recour&s;e to this remedy and found it effectual.

putrid fevers. In many of the We&s;t India i&s;lands it is generally employed in their malignant fevers. Dr Stevens, a gentleman of high character in his profe&s;&s;ion, who is now in this city, a&s;&s;ures me that in the i&s;land of St. Croix where he practi&s;ed me|dicine many years, it has been found more effec|tual than any method heretofore practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>I am moreover indebted to Dr Stevens for the following ob&s;ervations: that laxatives are ne|ver employed but when cly&s;ters are not attended with the de&s;ired effect of moving the bowels; that in violent attacks of the di&s;ea&s;e the bark cly&s;ters are repeated every two hours, and the water is applied to the body every 6 or 8 hours and even more frequently; that when there is a di&s;po&s;ition to diarrhoea, the elixir of vitriol has a tendency to encrea&s;e it, and is therefore laid a&s;ide, and that the di&s;ea&s;e which he has &s;een in this country is of the &s;ame nature with the malignant fever of the We&s;t Indies.</P>

am to attribute, under God, to the &s;kill and care of my friend Doctor Stevens, a gentleman lately from the i&s;land of St. Croix, one to who&s;e talents I can atte&s;t, from an intimate acquaintance began in early youth, who&s;e medical opportunities have been of the be&s;t, and who has had the advantage of much experience both in Europe (having been in Edinburgh &s;ome years &s;ince, when the &s;ame fever raged there) and in the We&s;t Indies, where it is frequent.

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN compliance with the reque&s;t of the learned body over whom you pre&s;ide, I now chearfully tran&s;mit them a few brief and detached ob&s;ervations on the nature and treatment of the
<PB N="217" REF="027658_0224_0FD7C86AE64D0DC0">
pre&s;ent malignant and fatal di&s;order which pre|vails in this city. Their humane anxiety to a&s;|certain the real character of the complaint, and to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome fixed and &s;teady mode of cure for it, are fre&s;h proofs of their benevolence, and clearly evinces that di&s;intere&s;ted liberality for which they are &s;o eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed. I only regret that their application to me has ap|proached &s;o near the moment of my departure, that I have not &s;ufficient lei&s;ure to elucidate the &s;ubject &s;o amply and &s;o &s;atisfactorily as the impor|tance of it de&s;erves. Imperfect, however, as the enclo&s;ed &s;ketch may be, I can with truth a&s;&s;ure them, that it is the re&s;ult of exten&s;ive experience and accurate ob&s;ervation; and that it is dictated &s;olely by a philanthropic de&s;ire of checking the ravages of di&s;ea&s;e, and of re&s;toring tranquillity to the dejected minds of the public.</P>
<P>This di&s;order ari&s;es from contagion. Its ap|proaches are &s;low and in&s;iduous at the commence|ment. It is u&s;hered in with a &s;light degree of lan|guor and la&s;&s;itude, lo&s;s of appetite, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and di&s;turbed dreams, depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, and a want of inclination to perform the ordinary occupations of life. The patient does not con&s;ider him&s;elf &s;uf|ficiently &s;ick to complain or call in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a phy&s;ician. His feelings are rather unplea|&s;ant
<PB N="218" REF="027658_0225_0FD7C97F72850F48">
than alarming. This train of &s;ymptoms con|tinue for two or three days, and if not removed by timely aid, is &s;ucceeded by a &s;harp pain in the head, anxiety, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ion about the praecor|dia, a feeble pul&s;e, great pro&s;tration of &s;trength, and a variety of other morbid phenomena, which are too well known to the faculty to need de&s;crip|tion. In the fir&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;order, a little at|tention, and the well directed efforts of a &s;kilful practitioner, may generally prove &s;ucce&s;sful in mi|tigating the violence of future &s;ymptoms, and pre|venting either much danger or long confinement.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t appearance of languor, la&s;&s;itude, &amp;c. e&s;pecially if the patient has been near the &s;ource of contagion, he &s;hould carefully avoid all fatigue of body and application of mind. Every thing that can tend to debilitate &s;hould be care|fully guarded again&s;t. He &s;hould remain at per|fect re&s;t. His diet &s;hould be fuller and more cor|dial than u&s;ual, and a few extraordinary gla&s;&s;es of old Madeira may be allowed. He &s;hould take the cold bath every morning; and if his &s;leep is di&s;turbed, a gentle opiate combined with a few grains of the volatile &s;alts and &s;ome grateful aro|matic may be admini&s;tered at night. A few do&s;es of good genuine bark may be taken in powder during the day; and if the &s;tomach &s;hould be af|fected
<PB N="219" REF="027658_0226_0FD7C984810031F0">
with nau&s;ea, a &s;trong decoction of the &s;ame may be &s;ub&s;tituted. Great care &s;hould be taken to keep the mind of the patient calm and &s;erene,&mdash;neither to terrify it with needle&s;s apprehen&s;ion, nor alarm it by the melancholy relation of the &s;preading mortality which &s;urrounds him. It is at this &s;tage of the complaint, that the phy&s;ician may lay the foundation of future &s;ucce&s;s. But unfortunately, it is al&s;o the period of the di&s;ea&s;e which is commonly too much neglected by the pa|tient. Gentlemen of the faculty are rarely called in until the &s;ymptoms are more alarming and dan|gerous. But it is a matter of material con&s;e|quence to the patient to know that by a little at|tention at the commencement, and by carefully watching the approaches of the di&s;ea&s;e even tho' it &s;hould be contracted, it may be rendered mild, and may terminate favourably. It is al&s;o of equal con&s;equence for practitioners to attend to the&s;e particulars in laying down the prophylaxis to their patients.</P>
<P>When the di&s;order has gained ground and be|come violent and when the danger is imminent, the mo&s;t unremitted exertions &s;hould be made by the phy&s;ician to mitigate the &s;ymptoms. The nau&s;ea and vomiting may be relieved by an infu&s;ion of ca|momile flowers, given frequently until the &s;tomach
<PB N="220" REF="027658_0227_0FD7C98879A6D1D0">
is &s;ufficiently emptied of all crude matter. Small do&s;es of a cordial mixture compo&s;ed of the oil of peppermint and compound &s;pirits of lavender, may then be taken until the fever abates. If, notwith|&s;tanding, the irritability of the &s;tomach &s;hould &s;till continue, recour&s;e mu&s;t be in&s;tantly had to the cold bath, which mu&s;t be u&s;ed every two hours or oftener if the urgency of the &s;ymptoms &s;hould require it. After each immer&s;ion a gla&s;s of old Madeira, or a little brandy burnt with cinnamon, may be admini&s;tered. Flannel cloths wrung out of &s;pirits of wine, impregnated with &s;pices, may be applied to the pit of the &s;tomach, and changed frequently.</P>
<P>An injection containing an ounce of powder|ed bark, mixed with thin &s;alap or <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ago, to which a tea-&s;poon full of laudanum has been added, &s;hould be admini&s;tered. The&s;e injections may be continued every two or three hours, omitting the laudanum after the fir&s;t. As &s;oon as the &s;tomach can bear the medicines and nouri&s;hment, the bark may be admini&s;tered in &s;mall do&s;es; as much Ma|deira wine may be given as the patient can bear without affecting his head, or heating him too much. All emetics and violent cathartics &s;hould be avoided. If the bowels &s;hould not be &s;uffici|ciently open, a laxative cly&s;ter may be nece&s;&s;ary,
<PB N="221" REF="027658_0228_0FD7C86E4D6EA8E0">
or a few grains of powdered rhubarb added to each do&s;e of bark until the de&s;ired effect is pro|duced. If diarrhoea &s;hould prevail, it mu&s;t be checked by &s;tarch injections blended with lauda|num by the tinctura E. kino japonica, or a decoc|tion of carcarilla. All dra&s;tic cathartics do in|jury when the di&s;ea&s;e is in its advanced &s;tage. If &s;tupor, coma, or delirium &s;hould come on, a large bli&s;ter &s;hould be applied between the &s;houlders, and &s;mall ones to the thighs; &s;timulant catapla&s;ms &s;hould al&s;o be applied to to the &s;oles of the feet: when hemorrhagies appear, the elixir of vitriol may be admini&s;tered in conjunction with the bark, but great care &s;hould be taken to prevent it from affecting the bowels.</P>
<P>If the pul&s;e &s;hould be much &s;unk, the pro|&s;tration of &s;trength great, and &s;ub&s;ultus tendinum take place, &s;mall do&s;es of the liquor mineralis Hoffmanni, or even vitriolic aether diluted with water may be given. Mu&s;k and camphor in this &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e have likewi&s;e proved effectual. Upon the whole, &s;ir, I may &s;um up this ha&s;ty out|line, by inculcating the u&s;e of the tonic plan in its fulle&s;t extent, and by warning again&s;t the ill con|&s;equences of debilitating applications, or profu&s;e evacuations in every period of the di&s;ea&s;e: the cold bath, bark and wine, a &s;pacious well ventila|ted

room, frequent change of bed and body linen, and attention to re&s;t and quiet, if properly per&s;e|vered in, will in mo&s;t ca&s;es prove &s;ucce&s;sful, and &s;trip this formidable di&s;ea&s;e of its malignity, its terror, and its danger.</P>
<P>The de&s;cription I have given of this di&s;order, and the utility of the plan of cure I have laid down, are confirmed by experience and coincides with our rea&s;on and the &s;ounde&s;t theory; the cau&s;e producing the effect is a &s;trong debilitating power; the &s;ymptoms occa&s;ioned by its applica|tion, indicate extreme debility in the animal func|tions, and great derangement of the nervous &s;y&s;|tem: ought not therefore the remedies adapted to this complaint to be cordial, &s;timulating, and tonic? Should not violent evacuations, which evi|dently weaken and relax, be avoided? The&s;e are hints which it would be pre&s;umptuous and a&s;&s;u|ming in me to extend or dwell upon: to gentle|men of &s;uch eminence as your colleagues, it is &s;uf|ficient to point out what rea&s;on and experience conjointly &s;ugge&s;t to me. Their &s;uperior judg|ment will, I am convinced, &s;upply every deficien|cy, and enable them to pur&s;ue that plan which is be&s;t adapted to public utility, and the effectual re|moval of the pre&s;ent dreadful malady. If the few ob&s;ervations I have &s;ugge&s;ted be &s;erviceable to

<P>IT is with extreme regret that I have read Dr Steven's letter to the pre&s;ident of our College in one of the news-papers. It will,
<PB N="224" REF="027658_0231_0FD7C9935F35DA58">
I fear, co-operate with Dr. Kuhn's plan of treat|ing the di&s;order, and Mr Hamilton's well-meant letter, in adding to the mortality of the di&s;order. If I &s;hould &s;urvive my pre&s;ent labours, I hope to prove that Dr Stevens's theory of the di&s;ea&s;e in the We&s;t Indies, is as erroneous, as the practice he has recommended has been fatal, in Philadel|phia. It is a mo&s;t inflammatory di&s;order in its fir&s;t &s;tage. The contagion, it is true, in its fir&s;t action upon the &s;y&s;tem, frequently produces debi|lity; but the debility here is of the <HI>indirect</HI> kind, and ari&s;es wholly from an exce&s;s of the &s;timulus of contagion upon the &s;y&s;tem. This indirect debility, as in many other di&s;ea&s;es, yields only to the ab|&s;traction of other &s;timuli, and to none &s;o &s;peedily as to large evacuations from the bowels and the blood-ve&s;&s;els.</P>

<P>As the weekly meetings of our College have become no longer practicable, I have taken the liberty of communicating to you, the re&s;ult of further ob&s;ervations upon the pre|vailing epidemic.</P>
<P>I have found bleeding to be u&s;eful, not only in ca&s;es where the pul&s;e was full and quick, but where it was <HI>&s;low</HI> and <HI>ten&s;e.</HI> I have bled in one ca&s;e, where the pul&s;e beat only 48 &s;trokes in a minute, and recovered my patient by it. The pul&s;e became more full and more frequent after
<PB N="226" REF="027658_0233_0FD7C996F1441F20">
it. This &s;tate of the pul&s;e &s;eems to ari&s;e from an inflamed &s;tate of the brain, which &s;hows it&s;elf in a preternatural dilatation of the pupils of the eyes. It is always un&s;afe to tru&s;t to the mo&s;t perfect re|mi&s;&s;ions of fever and pain in this &s;tate of the pul&s;e. It indicates the nece&s;&s;ity of more bleeding and purging. I have found it to occur mo&s;t fre|quently in children.</P>
<P>I have bled twice in many, and in one acute ca&s;e, four times, with the happie&s;t effects. I con|&s;ider intrepidity in the u&s;e of the lancet at pre&s;ent to be as nece&s;&s;ary, as it is in the u&s;e of mercury and jalap, in this in&s;idious and ferocious di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>I lament the contrariety of opinion among the members of our College, upon the remedies proper in this di&s;ea&s;e. This contrariety &s;eems to ari&s;e from the yellow fever being confounded with the jail or ho&s;pital fever. The fevers of Bre&s;lau, Vienna, and Edinburgh, mentioned in &s;ome late publications, in which the cold bath was u&s;ed with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s, were of the latter kind. The two di&s;ea&s;es are totally different from each other in their cau&s;e, &s;ea&s;ons of prevailing, &s;ymptoms, danger, and method of cure.</P>

Where the purges can|not be obtained, or do not operate &s;peedily, bleeding may <HI>now</HI> be u&s;ed before they are taken. The almo&s;t univer&s;al &s;ucce&s;s with which it hath plea&s;ed God to ble&s;s the remedies of &s;trong mer|curial purges and bleeding in this di&s;order, ena|bles Dr Ru&s;h to a&s;&s;ure his fellow citizens, that there is no more danger to be apprehended from it, when tho&s;e remedies are u&s;ed in its early &s;tage, than there is from the mea&s;les or the influenza.</P>
<P>Dr Ru&s;h a&s;&s;ures his fellow citizens further, that the ri&s;k from vi&s;iting and attending the &s;ick, in common ca&s;es, at pre&s;ent, is not greater than from walking the &s;treets. He hopes this informa|tion will be attended to, as many of the &s;ick &s;uffer greatly from the want of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of bleeders, and of the attendance of nur&s;es and friends.</P>

While the di&s;ea&s;e was &s;o generally mortal, or the &s;ucce&s;sful mode of treating it only partially adopted, Dr Ru&s;h advi&s;ed his friends to leave the city: at pre&s;ent he conceives this advice to be unnece&s;&s;ary; not only becau&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e is now under the power of medicine, but becau&s;e the citizens who now wi&s;h to fly into the country, cannot avoid carrying the infection with them.

<P>Having mentioned the conditional u&s;e of bark, wine, and laudanum, in my fir&s;t publication, and finding them not only u&s;ele&s;s, but hurtful, I pub|li&s;hed the following addre&s;s to the citizens of Phi|ladelphia, on the 16th of September.

<P>Dr Ru&s;h recommends to all &s;uch of his fel|low citizens as are expo&s;ed to the contagion of the prevailing fever, to live upon a milk and ve|getable diet, and take cooling purges once or twice a week. The effects of this regimen in ren|dering the di&s;ea&s;e mild (where it is taken) are nearly the &s;ame as in preparing the body for the &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P>Dr R. advi&s;es tho&s;e per&s;ons who cannot ob|tain the attendance of a phy&s;ician, by no means to take vomits, bark, wine, or laudanum, during the fir&s;t three or four days of the di&s;order. As the di&s;ea&s;e is highly inflammatory at pre&s;ent in its fir&s;t &s;tages, the only proper remedies for it are, &s;trong purges, copious bleeding, if the pul&s;e be <HI>full</HI> or <HI>ten&s;e,</HI> or if it be <HI>&s;lower</HI> than natural, and at the &s;ame time &s;ubject to pau&s;es in its pul&s;a|tion.</P>
<P>During this inflammatory &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e, the drinks &s;hould be &s;imple and cold. No animal food &s;hould be ta&s;ted; cool air &s;hould be admit|ted into the room, and napkins dipped in pump water, &s;hould be applied frequently to the fore|head.</P>

<P>IT affords me particular &s;atisfac|tion, that I now have it in my power to inform my fellow citizens, that the progre&s;s of the infec|tious fever has greatly abated, and that with a
<PB N="231" REF="027658_0238_0FD7C9A3622D15A0">
little longer per&s;everance in avoiding intercour&s;e with the infected, as far as humanity will permit, paying at the &s;ame time, proper attention to fu|migating and ventilating the hou&s;es, clothing, and uten&s;ils from whence the &s;ick have been removed, or where they have been confined, the infection which has proved &s;o mortal, will mo&s;t certainly, be entirely eradicated in a few days. The be&s;t method for effecting this, is contained in a late publication by the learned Dr Ru&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>I have made the &s;tricte&s;t enquiry re&s;pecting the number at pre&s;ent confined by the genuine yellow fever, and am convinced that it does not exceed 40 or 50 in the whole city.</P>
<P>There is, however, another formidable di&s;|ea&s;e prevalent, by which, I have rea&s;on to believe, there are above a thou&s;and ill at this time.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e I mean, is the common remittent or fall fever. This fever, however, is not in|fectious.</P>
<P>When the remitting fever attacks per&s;ons not fully recovered from the effects of the influenza, (which is al&s;o &s;till prevalent here) it occa&s;ions a violent determination of the blood to the head,
<PB N="232" REF="027658_0239_0FD7C9A909063DE0">
accompanied with acute pain, a redne&s;s of the eyes, with a faint tinge of yellow&mdash;the pul&s;e is quick and the &s;kin hot. This is the di&s;ea&s;e which is &s;o much under the power of blood-letting and purging; and is as different from the infectious, or genuine yellow fever, as the &s;un is from the moon, or light from darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>In the fall fever, which &s;ucceeds the influenza, the eye is &s;prightly, though red, the face turgid and flu&s;hed:&mdash;Whereas, in the genuine yellow fever, the eye is dull and inanimate, and &s;uffu&s;ed with a du&s;ky brown, the face pale, &s;hrunk, and cadaverous, almo&s;t from the fir&s;t attack. It is in the remitting fever, with the violent affection of the head, that the mode of treatment advi&s;ed by Dr Ru&s;h, can only be proper; and not in the in|fectious or yellow fever. On the contrary, in the yellow fever, it cannot fail of being certain death. In the yellow fever, the means recom|mended by Dr Kuhn and Dr Stevens, are the mo&s;t effectual, and the only ones that can be relied on, with &s;uch a variation as circum&s;tances, and the period of the di&s;ea&s;e may indicate.</P>
<P>It is in the fall fever, circum&s;tanced as already de&s;cribed, that there is &s;afety in vi&s;iting and at|tending the &s;ick, becau&s;e this fever is not conta|gious.
<PB N="233" REF="027658_0240_0FD7C877A5A67938">
Can there be the &s;ame &s;afety in vi&s;iting patients confined with the genuine yellow fever, which made its appearance in Water-&s;treet, the third of Augu&s;t la&s;t? Let tho&s;e judge who have had opportunities of &s;eeing its ravages! Is that fever, in which the bond of union is immediately di&s;&s;olved between the &s;olids and fluids, and where the purple current i&s;&s;ues from every pore, the &s;ame as that, for which Dr Ru&s;h directs bleeding and purging? and can there be &s;afety in vi&s;iting per&s;ons &s;o affected? Have we all got the conta|gion of the yellow fever in our bodies, only wait|ing for &s;ome exciting cau&s;e to put it into action? By no means. The di&s;ea&s;e, which Dr Ru&s;h calls the yellow fever, and of which Dr P. &s;ays he has cured &s;uch numbers by the <HI>new method,</HI> is only the fall fever, operating on per&s;ons who have been previou&s;ly affected by the influenza.</P>

<P>Dr Ru&s;h is extremely &s;orry to differ from his friend Dr Currie, in his opinion re&s;pecting the prevailing epidemic, publi&s;hed in the Federal Ga|zette of la&s;t evening. Dr R. a&s;&s;erts, from the au|thority of Dr Sydenham, as well as from the ob&s;ervations of three and thirty years upon epide|mic di&s;ea&s;es, that no two epidemics of <HI>unequal</HI> force can exi&s;t long together in the &s;ame place; and he is &s;ure, from what he has &s;een of the pre|&s;ent di&s;ea&s;e, that all the fevers now in the city, are from <HI>one</HI> cau&s;e, and that they all require dif|ferent portions of the &s;ame remedies. Dr R. has no other motives for wi&s;hing to be believed by his fellow citizens in the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, than to beget a confidence in them, in remedies, which he con|ceives to be as rational, as he knows them to be &s;ucce&s;sful in the prevailing di&s;order. If Dr Cur|rie will con&s;ult Blane, Hume, Lining, and Hillary, upon the &s;ubject of the yellow fever, he will find that they all de&s;cribe it as making its fir&s;t attack with the &s;ymptoms of a bilious remittent. Dr R. perfectly recollects its appearing not only in this form, but in that of an intermittent, in the year 1762.</P>
<P>Among many arguments which might be ad|duced to prove that all our pre&s;ent fevers ari&s;e from one &s;ource, and require the &s;ame treatment,

<P>No one can &s;uppo&s;e that Dr. R's late indi&s;|po&s;ition (after having been con&s;tantly expo&s;ed for three weeks, to the contagion of the yellow fever in all its degrees of malignity) was not occa&s;ioned by an attack of that di&s;order, and yet he owes his perfect recovery through divine goodne&s;s, &s;im|ply to two copious bleedings, and two do&s;es of the mercurial medicine, and that too, in the &s;hort term of only <HI>two</HI> days.</P>

<P>A NUMBER of the phy&s;icians of this city, who &s;uppo&s;e that we have two fevers now prevailing among us, have a&s;&s;erted that a yellow colour is e&s;&s;ential to what is called the yel|low fever. The following extract from Dr Mo&s;ely will &s;hew how much they have been mi&s;taken. This judicious phy&s;ician practi&s;ed phy&s;ic many years in Jamaica, and &s;aw the fever which he de&s;cribes, in all its different forms.</P>
<P>"I have u&s;ed (&s;ays the Doctor) the word <HI>yel|low</HI> in compliance with cu&s;tom; but I even di&s;tru&s;t that name, as the <HI>inexperienced</HI> may be looking out for that appearance, and not find, until it is <HI>too late,</HI> the di&s;ea&s;e he has to contend with.

Be&s;ides, the yellowne&s;s alone, leads to nothing certain; it may ari&s;e from an inoffen|&s;ive &s;uffu&s;ion of bile." p. 411&mdash;&s;econd edition.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent epidemic has likewi&s;e been called a putrid fever and the remedies for the cure of that &s;pecies of fever have been very generally pre|&s;cribed. The following extract from the &s;ame author will &s;how the error and mi&s;chief of that opinion and practice:</P>
<P>"This di&s;ea&s;e is in the highe&s;t degree po&s;&s;i|ble, an inflammatory one, accompanied with &s;uch &s;ymptoms, in a greater extent as attend all inflam|matory fevers, and mo&s;t &s;trikingly the rever&s;e of any di&s;ea&s;e that is putrid, or of one <HI>continued ex|acerbation.</HI> It attacks all &s;uch people and under &s;uch circum&s;tances as are &s;eldom the objects of putrid di&s;ea&s;es." p. 412.</P>
<P>In another place he &s;ays, Bleeding mu&s;t be performed, and repeated every &s;ix or eight hours, or whenever the exacerbations come on, while the heat, fullne&s;s of pul&s;e, and pains con|tinue;
<PB N="240" REF="027658_0247_0FD7CBD59470DD48">
and if the&s;e &s;ymptoms be violent and ob|&s;tinate, and do not abate during the fir&s;t 36 or 48 hours of the fever, bleeding &s;hould be executed even to fainting. Taking away only &s;ix or eight ounces of blood becau&s;e the patient may be faint, which is a &s;ymptom of the di&s;ea&s;e, is doing no|thing towards the cure. Where bleeding is im|proper, no blood &s;hould be taken away; where it is proper that quantity will not relieve, and it is lo&s;ing that time, which can never be regained. p. 427&mdash;428.</P>
<P>On PURGES, the doctor makes the following remarks.</P>
<P>"When a &s;ufficient quantity of blood has been taken away, (which is <HI>never</HI> done) let the patient's habit be what it may, while the heat, reiterated exacerbations, flu&s;hings in the face, thir&s;t, pains in the head, and burning in the eyes remain, the next &s;tep is to evacuate the contents of the bow|els, and turn the humours downwards." p. 435.</P>
<P>Speaking of opium, the Doctor &s;ays, In a fever &s;o highly inflammatory, where the contents of the whole alimentary canal are &s;o hot and acrid, opium mu&s;t be a fatal medicine. p. 459.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="027658_0248_0FD7CBD76580D480">
To the&s;e quotations I &s;hall only add, that the di&s;ea&s;e, from the influence of the cool weather is probably more univer&s;ally, and more highly in|flammatory, in our city, and requires more copious evacuations than in the I&s;land of Jamaica. It certainly requires more &s;peedy and more plentiful bleeding than a common pleuri&s;y, ina&s;much as the blood-ve&s;&s;els, rendered weak by the previous hot &s;ummer, are in more danger of being ruptured both externally and internally, from the violent &s;timulus of the contagion, than in an inflamma|tory fever, which &s;ucceeds cold weather.</P>

<P><PB N="243" REF="027658_0250_0FD7C88FA59A1558">
From the different publications which I have in&s;erted, it appears that there were two modes of practice pur&s;ued; the one dictated by an opinion that the di&s;ea&s;e was highly putrid, and the other, that it was of a highly inflammatory nature. But be&s;ides the&s;e there were two other modes of treat|ing the di&s;ea&s;e, the one by <HI>moderate</HI> purging with calomel only, and moderate bleeding, on the fir&s;t or &s;econd day of the fever, and afterwards by the copious u&s;e of bark, wine, laudanum, and aro|matic tonics. This practice was &s;upported by an opinion, that the fever was inflammatory in its fir&s;t, and putrid in its &s;econd &s;tage; the other mode referred to, was peculiar to the French phy&s;icians, &s;everal of whom had arrived in the city from the We&s;t Indies ju&s;t before the di&s;order made its appearance. Their remedies were va|rious. Some of them pre&s;cribed nitre, cremor tartar, camphor, centaury tea, the warm bath, gly&s;ters, and moderate bleeding, while a few, u&s;ed lenient purges, and large quantities of tama|rind water, and other diluting drinks. The di&s;|&s;entions of the American phy&s;icians threw a great number of patients into the hands of the&s;e French phy&s;icians. They were moreover &s;uppo&s;ed to be better acquainted with the di&s;ea&s;e than the phy&s;i|cians of the city, mo&s;t of whom it was well known had never &s;een it before.</P>

<HEAD>OF PURGING.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE already mentioned my rea|&s;ons for promoting this evacuation, and the medi|cine I preferred for that purpo&s;e. It had many advantages over any other purge. It was de|tergent to the bile and mucus which lined the bowels. It probably acted in a peculiar manner upon the biliary ducts, and it was rapid in its ope|ration. One do&s;e was &s;ometimes &s;ufficient to open the bowels; but from two to &s;ix do&s;es were often nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e; more e&s;pecially as part of them was frequently rejected by the &s;tomach. I did not ob&s;erve any inconvenience from the vomiting which was excited by the jalap.
<PB N="245" REF="027658_0252_0FD7CBDC56016088">
It was always without that &s;training which is pro|duced by emetics; and it &s;erved to di&s;charge bile when it was lodged in the &s;tomach. I did not re&s;t the di&s;charge of the contents of the bowels on the i&s;&s;ue of one clean&s;ing on the fir&s;t day. There is in all bilious fevers, a reproduction of morbid bile as fa&s;t as it is di&s;charged. I therefore gave a purge every day while the fever continued. I u&s;ed ca&s;tor oil, &s;alts, cremor tartar, and rhubarb (after the mercurial purges had performed their office) according to the inclinations of my pati|ents, in all tho&s;e ca&s;es where the bowels were ea|&s;ily moved; but where this was not the ca&s;e, I gave a &s;ingle do&s;e of calomel and jalap every day. Strong as this purge may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be, it was often ineffectual; more e&s;pecially after the 20th of September, when the bowels became more ob&s;tinately con&s;tipated. To &s;upply the place of the jalap, I now added gamboge to the calo|mel. Two grains and an half of each made into a pill, were given to an adult every &s;ix hours until they procured four or five &s;tools. I had other de|&s;igns in giving a purge every day be&s;ides di&s;charging the re-accumulated bile. I had ob&s;erved the fever to fall with its principal force upon &s;uch parts of the body as had been previou&s;ly weakened by any former di&s;ea&s;e. By creating an artificial weak part in the bowels, I diverted the force of the fe|ver

to them, and thereby &s;aved the liver and brain from fatal or dangerous conge&s;tions. The prac|tice was further ju&s;tified by the beneficial effects of a plentiful &s;pontaneous diarrhoea in the begin|ning of the di&s;order<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In &s;ome &s;hort manu&s;cript notes upon Dr Mitchell's account of the yellow fever in Virginia, in the year 1741, made by the late Dr Kear&s;ley, Sen. of this city, he remarks, that in the yellow fever which prevailed in the &s;ame year in Philadelphia "&s;ome recovered by an <HI>early</HI> di&s;charge of <HI>black</HI> matter by &s;tool." This gentleman, Dr Redman informed me, introduced purging with Glauber &s;alts in the yellow fever in our city. He was preceptor to Dr Redman in medicine.</NOTE>; by hemorrhagies from the bowels, when they occurred from no other parts of the body, and by the difficulty or impractica|bility of reducing the &s;y&s;tem by means of plen|tiful &s;weats. The purges &s;eldom an&s;wered the in|tentions for which they were given, unle&s;s they produced four or five &s;tools a day. As the fever &s;hewed no regard to day or night in the hours of its exacerbations, it became nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve the &s;ame di&s;regard to time in the exhibition of purges; I therefore pre&s;cribed them in the even|ing at all times when the patient had pa&s;&s;ed a day without two or three plentiful &s;tools. When purges were rejected, or &s;low in their operation, I always directed opening gly&s;ters to be given

every two hours. The effects of purging were as follow:</P>
<P N="1">1. It rai&s;ed the pul&s;e when low, and reduced it when it was preternaturally ten&s;e or full.</P>
<P N="2">2. It revived and &s;trengthened the patient. This was evident in many ca&s;es, in the facility with which patients who had &s;taggered to a clo&s;e-&s;tool, walked back again to their beds, after a co|pious evacuation. Dr Sydenham takes notice of a &s;imilar encrea&s;e of &s;trength after a plentiful &s;weat in the plague. They both acted by ab|&s;tracting exce&s;s of &s;timulus, and thereby removing indirect debility.</P>
<P N="3">3. It abated the paroxi&s;m of the fever. Hence aro&s;e the advantage of giving a purge in &s;ome ca&s;es in the evening, when an attack of the fever was expected in the cour&s;e of the night.</P>
<P N="4">4. It frequently produced &s;weats when given on the fir&s;t or &s;econd day of the fever, after the mo&s;t powerful &s;udorifics had been taken to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="5">5. It &s;ometimes checked that vomiting which oc|curs in the beginning of the di&s;order; and it al|ways a&s;&s;i&s;ted in preventing the more alarming occur|rence of that &s;ymptom, about the 4th or 5th day.</P>

6. It removed ob&s;tructions in the lymphatic &s;y&s;|tem. I a&s;cribe it wholly to the action of mer|cury, that in no in&s;tance did any of the glandular &s;wellings, which I formerly mentioned, terminate in a &s;uppuration.</P>
<P N="7">7. By di&s;charging the bile through the bowels as &s;oon and as fa&s;t as it was &s;ecreted, it prevented in mo&s;t ca&s;es a yellowne&s;s of the &s;kin.</P>
<P>However &s;alutary the mercurial purge was, ob|jections were made to it by many of our phy&s;i|cians; and prejudices, equally weak and ill-found|ed, were excited again&s;t it. I &s;hall enumerate and an&s;wer tho&s;e objections.</P>
<P N="1">1. It was &s;aid to be of too dra&s;tic a nature. It was compared to ar&s;enic; and it was called a do&s;e for a hor&s;e. This objection was without founda|tion. Hundreds who took it declared they had never taken &s;o mild a purge. I met with but one ca&s;e in which it produced bloody &s;tools; but I &s;aw the &s;ame effect from a do&s;e of &s;alts. It &s;ome|times, it is true, operated from twenty to thirty times in the cour&s;e of twenty-four hours; but I heard of an equal number of &s;tools in two ca&s;es from &s;alts and cremor tartar. It is not an ea&s;y thing to affect life, or even &s;ub&s;equent health, by

copious or frequent purging. Dr Kirkland mentions a remarkable ca&s;e of a gentleman who was cured of a rheumati&s;m by a purge, which gave him between 40 and 50 &s;tools. This patient had been previou&s;ly affected by his di&s;order 16 or 18 weeks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Treati&s;e on the Inflammatory Rheumati&s;m, vol. i. p. 407.</NOTE>. Dr Mo&s;ely not only proves the &s;afe|ty, but e&s;tabli&s;hes the efficacy of numerous and copious &s;tools in the yellow fever. Dr Say pro|bably owes his life to three-and-twenty &s;tools pro|cured by a do&s;e of calomel and gamboge, taken by my advice. Dr Redman was purged until he fainted, by a do&s;e of the &s;ame medicine. This venerable gentleman, in whom 70 years had not abated the ardour of humanity, nor produced ob|&s;tinacy of opinion, came forward from his retire|ment, and boldly adopted the remedies of purg|ing and bleeding, with &s;ucce&s;s in &s;everal families, before he was attacked by the di&s;ea&s;e. His reco|very was as rapid, as the medicine he had u&s;ed was active in its operation.

About the time the fever declined, I received a letter from Dr Shippen, Sen. (then above 82 years of age) dated Oxford Furnace, New Jer&s;ey, October 13th, 1793, in which, after approving in polite terms of my mode of practice, he adds "De&s;perate di&s;ea&s;es require de&s;perate remedies.

2. A &s;econd objection to this mercurial purge was, that it excited a &s;alivation, and &s;ometimes loo&s;ened the teeth. I met with but two ca&s;es in which there was a lo&s;s of teeth from the u&s;e of this medicine, and in both, the teeth were previ|ou&s;ly loo&s;e or decayed. The &s;alivation was a tri|fling evil, compared with the benefit which was derived from it. I lo&s;t only one patient in whom it occurred. I was taught by this accidental ef|fect of mercury, to admini&s;ter it with other views, than merely to clean&s;e the bowels, and with a &s;ucce&s;s which added much to my confidence in the power of medicine over this di&s;ea&s;e. I &s;hall men|tion tho&s;e views under another head.</P>
<P N="3">3. It was &s;aid that the mercurial purge, exco|riated the rectum, and produced the &s;ymptoms of pain and inflammation in that part, which were formerly mentioned.</P>
<P>To refute this charge, it will be &s;ufficient to remark that the bile produces the &s;ame excori|ation and pain in the rectum in the bilious and yellow fever, where no mercury has been given to di&s;charge it. In the bilious remitting fever which prevailed in Philadelphia in 1780, we find the bile which was di&s;charged by "gentle do&s;es of &s;alts, and cream of tartar, or the butternut pill, was &s;o
<PB N="252" REF="027658_0259_0FD7C884660BBF00">
acrid as to excoriate the rectum, and &s;o offen&s;ive as to occa&s;ion in &s;ome ca&s;es, &s;ickne&s;s and faintne&s;s both in the patients, and in their attendants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Medical Inquiries and Ob&s;ervations, London edition, vol. i. p. 112.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>Dr Hume &s;ays further upon this &s;ubject, that the rectum was &s;o much excoriated by the natural di&s;charge of bile in the yellow fever, as to render it impo&s;&s;ible to introduce a gly&s;ter pipe into it.</P>
<P N="4">4. It was objected to this purge, that it in|flamed, and lacerated the &s;tomach and bowels. In &s;upport of this calumny, the inflamed and morti|fied appearances which tho&s;e vi&s;cera exhibited upon di&s;&s;ection in a patient who died at the ho&s;|pital at Bu&s;h-hill, were &s;poken of with horror in &s;ome parts of the city. To refute this objection, it will only be nece&s;&s;ary to review the account formerly given of the &s;tate of the &s;tomach and bowels after death from the yellow fever, in ca&s;es in which no mercury had been given. I have before taken notice that Sir John Pringle, and Dr Cleghorn, had pre&s;cribed mercurial purges with &s;ucce&s;s in the dy&s;entery, a di&s;ea&s;e in which the bowels are affected with more irritation and inflammation than in the yellow fever. Dr Clark
<PB N="253" REF="027658_0260_0FD7CBEB1489D3E8">
informs us that he had adopted this practice. I &s;hall in&s;ert the eulogium of this excellent phy&s;i|cian, upon the u&s;e of mercury in the dy&s;entery in his own words. "For &s;everal years pa&s;t, when the dy&s;entery has re&s;i&s;ted the common mode of practice, I have admini&s;tered mercury with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s; and am thoroughly per&s;uaded that it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of powers to <HI>remove inflamma|tion,</HI> and <HI>ulceration</HI> of the inte&s;tines, which are the chief cau&s;es of death, in this di&s;temper<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 342.</NOTE>."</P>
<P N="5">5. It was urged again&s;t this powerful and effi|cacious medicine, that it was pre&s;cribed indi&s;cri|minately in all ca&s;es; and that it did harm in all weak habits. To this I an&s;wer, that there was no per&s;on &s;o weak by con&s;titution, or a previous di&s;ea&s;e, as to be injured by a &s;ingle do&s;e of this medicine. Mrs Meredith the wife of the Trea|&s;urer of the United States, a lady of uncommon delicacy of con&s;titution, took two do&s;es of the powder in the cour&s;e of twelve hours, not only without any inconvenience, but with an evident increa&s;e of &s;trength &s;oon afterwards. Many &s;imi|lar ca&s;es might be mentioned. Even children took two or three do&s;es of it with perfect &s;afety. This will not &s;urpri&s;e tho&s;e phy&s;icians who have
<PB N="254" REF="027658_0261_0FD7C885E5B8EFC8">
been in the practice of giving from ten to twenty grains of mercury, with an equal quantity of jalap, as a worm purge, and from fifty to an hun|dred grains of calomel in the cour&s;e of four or five days, in the internal drop&s;y of the brain. But I am happy in being able to add further, that many women took it in every &s;tage of pregnancy without &s;uffering the lea&s;t inconvenience from it. Out of a great number of pregnant women whom I attended in this fever, I did not lo&s;e one to whom I gave this medicine, nor did any of them &s;uffer an abortion. One of them had twice mi&s;|carried in the cour&s;e of the two or three la&s;t years of her life. She bore a healthy child three months after her recovery from the yellow fever.</P>
<P>No one has ever objected to the <HI>indi&s;criminate</HI> mode of preparing the body for the &s;mall-pox by purging medicines. The <HI>uniform</HI> inflammatory diathe&s;is of that di&s;ea&s;e, ju&s;tifies the practice, in a certain degree in all habits. The yellow fever admits of a &s;amene&s;s of cure much more than the &s;mall-pox, for it is <HI>more</HI> uniformly and more highly inflammatory. An ob&s;ervation of Dr Sydenham, upon epidemics applies in its utmo&s;t extent to our late fever. "Now it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved (&s;ays this mo&s;t acute Phy&s;ician) that &s;ome epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, in &s;ome years are uniformly and con&s;tantly the
<PB N="255" REF="027658_0262_0FD7CBEC8B163608">
&s;ame<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 9.</NOTE>." However diver&s;ified our fever was in &s;ome of its &s;ymptoms, it was in all ca&s;es accompa|nied by more or le&s;s inflammatory diathe&s;is, and by a morbid &s;tate of the alimentary canal.</P>
<P>Much has been &s;aid of the bad effects of this purge from its having been put up carele&s;sly by the apothecaries, or from its having been taken contrary to the printed directions, by many peo|ple. If it did harm in any one ca&s;e (which I do not believe) from the former of the above cau&s;es, the fault is not mine. Twenty men employed con|&s;tantly in putting up this medicine, would not have been &s;ufficient to have complied with all the de|mands which were made of me for it. Hundreds who were in health, called or &s;ent for it as well as the &s;ick, in order to have it in readine&s;s in ca&s;e they &s;hould be &s;urpri&s;ed by the di&s;order in the night, or at a di&s;tance from a phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>In all the ca&s;es, in which this purge was &s;up|po&s;ed to have been hurtful, when given on the fir&s;t or &s;econd day of the di&s;order, I believe it was becau&s;e it was not followed by repeated do&s;es of the &s;ame, or of &s;ome other purge; or becau&s;e it was not aided by blood-letting. I am led to make
<PB N="256" REF="027658_0263_0FD7C88767CB58F0">
this a&s;&s;ertion, not only from the authority of Dr Sydenham, who often mentions the good effects of bleeding in moderating or checking a diarrhoea, but by having heard no complaints of patients being purged to death by this medicine, after blood-letting was univer&s;ally adopted by all the phy&s;icians in the city.</P>
<P>It was remarkable that the demand for this purging powder continued to encrea&s;e under all oppo&s;ition, and that the &s;ale of it by the apothe|caries was greate&s;t towards the clo&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e. I &s;hall hereafter &s;ay, that this was not the ca&s;e with the We&s;t India remedies.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible that this purge &s;ometimes proved hurtful when it was given after the 5th day of the di&s;order, but it was &s;eldom given for the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> time after the third day, and when it was, the pa|tient was generally in &s;uch a &s;ituation that nothing did him either good or harm.</P>
<P>I derived great plea&s;ure from hearing after the fever had left the city, that calomel had been given with &s;ucce&s;s as a purge in bilious fevers in other parts of the Union be&s;ides Philadelphia. Dr Lawrence informed me that he had cured many patients by it, of the yellow fever which prevailed
<PB N="257" REF="027658_0264_0FD7CBEF957EBF20">
in New York in the year 1791, and the New York papers have told us that &s;everal practitioners had been in the habit of giving it in the autumnal fevers, with great &s;ucce&s;s in the We&s;tern parts of that &s;tate. They had probably learned the u&s;e of it from Dr Young, who formerly practi&s;ed in that part of the United States, and who lo&s;t no opportunity of making its prai&s;es public, wherever he went.</P>
<P>My pupil Mr Potter gave calomel and jalap in large do&s;es, with great &s;ucce&s;s in the bilious fever of Caroline county in Maryland, before he knew that I had adopted that purge in the cure of our epidemic. He had heard the hi&s;tory of its origin and u&s;e from me, &s;ome months before, in a con|ver&s;ation upon bilious fevers in my &s;hop.</P>
<P>I have only to add to my account of that purg|ing medicine, that under an expectation, that the yellow fever would mingle &s;ome of its bilious &s;ymp|toms, with the common inflammatory fevers of the winter, and fir&s;t &s;pring months, I gave that purge in the form of pills in every ca&s;e of inflam|matory fever to which I was called. The fatal i&s;&s;ue of &s;everal fevers in the city, during the win|ter, in which this precaution had been neglected, &s;atisfied me that my practice was proper and u&s;eful.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="027658_0265_0FD7C889E999EED0">
It is to be lamented that all new remedies are forced to pa&s;s through a fiery ordeal. Opium and bark were long the objects of terror and invective in the &s;chools of medicine.

<HEAD>OF BLOOD-LETTING.</HEAD>
<P>THE theory of this fever which led me to admini&s;ter purges, determined me to u&s;e blood-letting, as &s;oon as it &s;hould be indicated. I am di&s;po&s;ed to believe, that I was tardy in the u&s;e of this remedy, and I &s;hall long regret the lo&s;s of three patients, who might probably have been &s;aved by it. I cannot blame my&s;elf for not having u&s;ed it earlier, for the immen&s;e number of patients which poured in upon me, in the fir&s;t week of Sep|tember,

prevented my attending &s;o much to each of them, as was nece&s;&s;ary to determine upon the pro|priety of this evacuation. I was in the &s;ituation of a &s;urgeon in a battle, who runs to every call, and only &s;tays long enough with each &s;oldier, to &s;top the bleeding of his wound, while the encrea&s;e of the wounded, and the unexpected length of the battle, leave his original patients to &s;uffer from the want of more &s;uitable dre&s;&s;ings. The rea&s;ons which de|termined me to bleed were,</P>
<P N="1">1. The &s;tate of the pul&s;e, which became more ten&s;e, in proportion as the weather became cool.</P>
<P N="2">2. The appearance of a moi&s;t, and <HI>white</HI> tongue on the fir&s;t day of the di&s;order; a certain &s;ign of an inflammatory fever!</P>

5. The character of the di&s;ea&s;es which had pre|ceded the yellow fever. They were all more or le&s;s inflammatory. Even the &s;carlatina angino&s;a had partaken &s;o much of that diathe&s;is, as to re|quire one bleeding to &s;ubdue it.</P>
<P N="6">6. The warm and dry weather which had like|wi&s;e preceded the fever.

<P N="8">8. I was induced to pre&s;cribe blood-letting by recollecting its good effects in Mrs Plalmer's &s;on, whom I bled on the 20th of Augu&s;t; and who ap|peared to have been recovered by it.</P>

<P N="5">5. The blood was in &s;ome in&s;tances covered above with a blue pellicle of &s;izy lymph, while the part which lay in the bottom of the bowl was di&s;&s;olved. The lymph was in two ca&s;es mixed with green &s;treaks.</P>

<P N="7">7. In &s;ome patients, the blood, in the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, exhibited nearly <HI>all</HI> the appearances which have been mentioned. They were varied by the time in which the blood was drawn, and by the nature and force of the remedies which had been u&s;ed in the di&s;order.</P>
<P>The effects of blood-letting upon the &s;y&s;tem were as follow:</P>
<P N="1">1. It rai&s;ed the pul&s;e when depre&s;&s;ed, and quick|ened it, when it was preternaturally &s;low, or &s;ubject to intermi&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P N="2">2. It reduced its force and frequency.</P>
<P N="3">3. It checked in many ca&s;es, the vomiting which occurred in the beginning of the di&s;order, and thereby enabled the &s;tomach to retain the purging

medicine. It likewi&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;ted the purge in pre|venting the dangerous or fatal vomiting which came on about the 5th day.</P>
<P N="4">4. It le&s;&s;ened the difficulty of opening the bowels. Upon this account, in my publication of the 12th of September, I advi&s;ed bleeding to be u&s;ed <HI>before,</HI> as well as after taking the mercu|rial purge. Dr Woodhou&s;e informed me that he had &s;everal times &s;een patients call for the clo&s;e &s;tool while the blood was flowing from the vein.</P>
<P N="5">5. It removed delirium, coma, and ob&s;tinate wakefulne&s;s. It al&s;o prevented or checked he|morrhagies; hence perhaps another rea&s;on why not a &s;ingle in&s;tance of abortion occurred in &s;uch of my female patients as were pregnant.</P>
<P N="6">6. It di&s;po&s;ed in &s;ome ca&s;es to a gentle per&s;pi|ration.</P>
<P N="7">7. It le&s;&s;ened the &s;en&s;ible debility of the &s;y&s;tem, hence patients frequently ro&s;e from their beds, and walked acro&s;s their rooms in a few hours after the operation had been performed.</P>
<P N="8">8. The redne&s;s of the eyes frequently di&s;ap|peared in a few hours after bleeding. Mr Coxe

ob&s;erved a dilated pupil to contract to its natural &s;ize, within a few minutes after he had bound up the arm of his patient. I remarked in the former part of this work, that blindne&s;s in many in&s;tances attended or followed this fever. Only two &s;uch ca&s;es occurred among my patients. In one of them it was of &s;hort continuance, and in the other it was probably occa&s;ioned by the want of &s;uffi|cient bleeding. In every ca&s;e of blindne&s;s that came to my knowledge, bleeding had been omit|ted, or u&s;ed only in a very moderate degree.</P>
<P N="9">9. It ea&s;ed <HI>pain.</HI> Thou&s;ands can te&s;tify this effect of blood-letting. Many of my patients whom I bled with my own hand, acknowledged to me while the blood was flowing, that they were better; and &s;ome of them declared, that all their pains had left them, before I had completely bound up their arms.</P>
<P N="10">10. But blood-letting had in many ca&s;es an effect, the oppo&s;ite of <HI>ea&s;ing</HI> pain. It frequently encrea&s;ed it in every part of the body, more e&s;pe|cially in the head. It appeared to be the effect of the &s;y&s;tem ri&s;ing &s;uddenly from a &s;tate of indirect debility, and of an encrea&s;ed action of the blood-ve&s;&s;els which took place in con&s;equence of it. I have frequently &s;een complaints of the brea&s;t, and
<PB N="265" REF="027658_0272_0FD7CBFC91B0BB78">
of the head, made wor&s;e by a &s;ingle bleeding, and from the &s;ame cau&s;e. It was in &s;ome ca&s;es an unfortunate event in the yellow fever, for it pre|vented the blood-letting being repeated, by ex|citing, or &s;trengthening the prejudices of patients and phy&s;icians again&s;t it. In &s;ome in&s;tances, the patients grew wor&s;e after a &s;econd, and in one, after a third bleeding. This was the ca&s;e in Mi&s;s Redman. Her pains encrea&s;ed after three bleed|ings, but yielded to the fourth. Her father Dr. Redman concurred in this &s;eemingly ab&s;urd prac|tice. It was at this time, my old ma&s;ter reminded me of Dr Sydenham's remark, that moderate bleeding did harm in the plague, where copious bleeding was indicated, and that in the cure of that di&s;order, we &s;hould leave nature wholly to her&s;elf, or take the cure altogether out of her hands. The truth of this ob&s;ervation was very obvious. By taking away as much blood as re|&s;tored the blood-ve&s;&s;els to a morbid degree of action, without reducing this action afterwards, pain, conge&s;tion, and inflammation, were fre|quently encrea&s;ed, all of which were prevented, or occurred in a le&s;s degree, when the &s;y&s;tem ro&s;e gradually from the &s;tate of depre&s;&s;ion which had been induced by indirect debility. Under the in|fluence of the facts and rea&s;onings which have been mentioned, I bore the &s;ame te&s;timony in
<PB N="266" REF="027658_0273_0FD7CBFDDA812418">
acute ca&s;es, again&s;t what was called <HI>moderate</HI> bleeding, that I did again&s;t bark, wine and lauda|num in this fever.</P>
<P N="11">11. Blood-letting when u&s;ed <HI>early</HI> on the fir&s;t day, frequently &s;trangled the di&s;ea&s;e in its birth, and generally rendered it more light, and the con|vale&s;cence more &s;peedy and perfect. I am not &s;ure that it ever &s;hortened the duration of the fever where it was not u&s;ed within a few hours of the time of its attack. Under every mode of treatment, it &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed after it was completely formed to run its cour&s;e. I was &s;o &s;atisfied of this peculi|arity in the fever, that I ventured in &s;ome ca&s;es to predict the day on which it would terminate, not|with&s;tanding I took the cure entirely out of the hands of nature. I did not lo&s;e a patient on the third, whom I bled on the fir&s;t, or &s;econd day of the di&s;order.</P>
<P N="12">12. In tho&s;e ca&s;es which ended fatally, blood-letting re&s;tored, or pre&s;erved the u&s;e of rea&s;on, rendered death ea&s;y, and retarded the putre|faction of the body after death.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now mention &s;ome of the circum&s;tances which directed and regulated the u&s;e of this remedy.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="267" REF="027658_0274_0FD7CBFF1E42CBB0">
1. Where bleeding had been omitted, for three days, in acute ca&s;es it was &s;eldom u&s;eful. Where purging had been u&s;ed, it was &s;ometimes &s;ucce&s;sful. I recovered two patients who had taken the mercurial purges, whom I bled for the fir&s;t time on the 7th day. One of them was the daughter of Mr James Cre&s;&s;on, the other was a journeyman &s;hip-carpenter at Ken&s;ington. In tho&s;e ca&s;es where bleeding had been u&s;ed on the fir&s;t day, it was both &s;afe and u&s;eful to repeat it every day afterwards, during the continuance of the fever.</P>
<P N="2">2. I preferred bleeding in the exacerbation of the fever. The remedy here was applied when the di&s;|ea&s;e was in its greate&s;t force. A &s;ingle paroxi&s;m, was like a &s;udden &s;quall to the &s;y&s;tem, and unle&s;s abated by bleeding, or purging, produced univer|&s;al di&s;organization. I preferred the former to the latter remedy in ca&s;es of great danger, be|cau&s;e it was more &s;peedy, and more certain in its operation.</P>
<P N="3">3. I bled in &s;everal in&s;tances in the remi&s;|&s;ion of the fever, where the pul&s;e was ten&s;e or chorded. It le&s;&s;ened the violence of the &s;ucceed|ing paroxi&s;m.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="268" REF="027658_0275_0FD7CC02D7BB8FC0">
4. I bled in all tho&s;e ca&s;es in which the pul&s;e was preternaturally &s;low, provided it was ten&s;e. Mr Benj. W. Morris, Mr Thomas Wharton Jun. and Mr Wm. San&s;om, all owe their lives probably to their having been bled in the above &s;tate of the pul&s;e. I was led to u&s;e bleeding in this &s;tate of the pul&s;e, not only by the theory of the di&s;ea&s;e which I had adopted, but by the &s;ucce&s;s which had often attended this remedy, in a &s;low and depre&s;&s;|ed &s;tate of the pul&s;e in apoplexy and pneumony. I had, moreover, the authority of Dr Mo&s;ely in its favour, in the yellow fever, and of Dr Sydenham, in his account of a new fever, which appeared in the year 1685. The words of the latter phy&s;ician are &s;o appo&s;ite to the ca&s;es which have been men|tioned, that I hope I &s;hall be excu&s;ed for in&s;ert|ing them in this place. "All the &s;ymptoms of weakne&s;s (&s;ays our author) proceed from nature's being in a manner oppre&s;&s;ed, and overcome by the fir&s;t attack of the di&s;ea&s;e, &s;o as not to be able to rai&s;e regular &s;ymptoms adequate to the violence of the fever. I remember to have met with a remark|able in&s;tance of this &s;everal years ago, in a young man I then attended; for though he &s;eemed in a manner expiring, yet the outward parts felt &s;o cool, that I could not per&s;uade the attendants he had a fever, which could not di&s;engage, and &s;hew it&s;elf clearly, becau&s;e the ve&s;&s;els were &s;o full as to ob|&s;truct

the motion of the blood. However, I &s;aid, that they would &s;oon find the fever ri&s;e high enough upon bleeding him. Accordingly after taking away a large quantity of blood, as vio|lent a fever appeared as ever I met with, and did not go off till bleeding had been u&s;ed three or four times<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii p. 351.</NOTE>."</P>
<P N="5">5. I bled in tho&s;e ca&s;es in which the fever ap|peared in a tertian form, provided the pul&s;e was full and ten&s;e. I well recollect the &s;urpri&s;e with which Mr Van Berkel heard this pre&s;cription from me, at a time when he was able to walk and ride out on the intermediate days of a tertian fever. The event which followed this pre&s;cription, &s;hew|ed that it was not di&s;proportioned to the violence of his di&s;ea&s;e, for it &s;oon put on &s;uch acute and inflammatory &s;ymptoms as to require &s;ix &s;ub&s;e|quent bleedings to &s;ubdue it.</P>
<P N="6">6. I bled in tho&s;e ca&s;es where patients were able to walk about, provided the pul&s;e was the &s;ame as has been mentioned under the 4th head. I was determined as to the propriety of bleeding in the&s;e two &s;uppo&s;ed mild forms of the fever, by having ob&s;erved each of them when left to them&s;elves frequently to terminate in death.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="270" REF="027658_0277_0FD7C898C4BC0170">
7. I paid no regard to the di&s;&s;olved &s;tate of the blood, when it appeared on the fir&s;t or &s;econd day of the di&s;order, but repeated the bleedings after|wards in every ca&s;e, where the pul&s;e continued to indicate it. It was common to &s;ee &s;izy blood &s;uc|ceed that which was di&s;&s;olved. This occurred in Mr Jo&s;iah Coates, and Mr Samuel Powel. Had I believed that this di&s;&s;olved &s;tate of the blood aro&s;e from its putrefaction, I &s;hould have laid a&s;ide my lancet as &s;oon as I &s;aw it; but I had long ago part|ed with all ideas of putrefaction in bilious fevers. The refutation of this doctrine, was the object of one of my papers in the Medical Society of Edin|burgh, in the year 1767. The di&s;&s;olved appear|ance of the blood, I &s;uppo&s;e to be the effect of a certain action of the blood-ve&s;&s;els upon it. It oc|curs in fevers in which no putrid, or foreign mat|ter has been introduced into the &s;y&s;tem. The ty|phoid pneumony de&s;cribed by Dr Huxham in his epidemics, and well known in the &s;outhern &s;tates of America, in the &s;pring of the year, has never been a&s;cribed to any other remote cau&s;e, than the &s;en&s;ible qualities of the air.</P>
<P N="8">8. The pre&s;ence of petechiae did not deter me from repeating blood-letting, where the pul&s;e re|tained its fulne&s;s or ten&s;ion. I pre&s;cribed it with &s;ucce&s;s in the ca&s;es of Dr Mea&s;e, and of Mrs Geb|ler,
<PB N="271" REF="027658_0278_0FD7CC0720346A50">
in Dock-&s;treet, in each of whom petechiae had appeared. Bleeding was equally effectual in the ca&s;e of the Rev. Mr Keating at a time when his arms were &s;potted with that &s;pecies of eruptions which I have compared to mo&s;cheto-bites. I had precedents in Dr De Haen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ratio medendi, Vol. ii. p. 162. Vol. iv. p. 172.</NOTE>, and Dr Sydenham<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vol. 1. p. 210, and 264.</NOTE> in favour of this practice. So far from viewing the&s;e eruptions as &s;igns of putrefaction, I con&s;ider|ed them as marks of the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible inflamma|tory diathe&s;is. They di&s;appeared in each of the above ca&s;es after bleeding.</P>
<P N="9">9. In determining the quantity of blood to be drawn, I was governed by the &s;tate of the pul&s;e, and by the temperature of the weather. In the beginning of September, I found one or two mo|derate bleedings &s;ufficient to &s;ubdue the fever; but in proportion as the &s;y&s;tem ro&s;e by the dimi|nution of the &s;timulus of heat, and the fever put on more <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> &s;igns of inflammatory diathe&s;is, more frequent bleedings became nece&s;&s;ary. I bled many patients twice, and a few three times a day. I preferred frequent and &s;mall, to large bleedings, in the beginning of September; but towards the height and clo&s;e of the epidemic, I
<PB N="272" REF="027658_0279_0FD7CC08A0CE0A70">
&s;aw no inconvenience from the lo&s;s of a pint, and even twenty ounces of blood at a time. I drew from many per&s;ons &s;eventy and eighty ounces in five days; and from a few, a much larger quan|tity. Mr Gribble, cedar-cooper, in Front-&s;treet, lo&s;t by ten bleedings an hundred ounces of blood; Mr George, a carter in Ninth-&s;treet, lo&s;t about the &s;ame quantity by five bleedings; and Mr Peter Mierken, one hundred and fourteen ounces in five days. In the la&s;t of the above per&s;ons the quan|tity taken was determined by weight. Mr Toy, black&s;mith near Dock-&s;treet, was eight times bled in the cour&s;e of &s;even days. The quantity taken from him was about an hundred ounces. The blood in all the&s;e ca&s;es was den&s;e, and in the la&s;t very &s;izy. They were all attended in the month of October, and chiefly by my pupil Mr Fi&s;her; and they are all this day living and healthy in|&s;tances of the efficacy of copious blood-letting, and of the intrepidity and judgment of their young phy&s;ician. Children, and even old people, bore the lo&s;s of much more blood in this fever, than in common inflammatory fevers. I took above thirty ounces, in five bleedings, from a daughter of Mr Robert Bridges, who was then in the 9th year of her age. Even great debility, whether natural or brought on by previous di&s;ea&s;es, did not in tho&s;e few ca&s;es in which it yielded to the fever, deprive
<PB N="273" REF="027658_0280_0FD7CC0A1317AA30">
it of the uniformity of its inflammatory character. The following letter from my friend Dr Griffitts, written &s;oon after his recovery from a third attack of the fever, and ju&s;t before he went into the country for the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of his health, will furni&s;h a &s;triking illu&s;tration of the truth of the above ob&s;ervation.</P>

<P>I CANNOT leave town without a parting adieu to my kind friend, and &s;incere prayers for his pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry to find that the u&s;e of the lancet is &s;till &s;o much dreaded by too many of our phy|&s;icians; and while lamenting the death of a valua|ble friend this morning, I was told that he was bled but <HI>once</HI> during his di&s;order. Now if my poor frame, reduced by previous &s;ickne&s;s, great anxiety, and fatigue, and a very low diet, could bear <HI>&s;even</HI> bleedings in five days, be&s;ides purging, and no diet but toa&s;t and water, what &s;hall we &s;ay of phy&s;icians who bleed but once?</P>

<P>I have compared a paroxi&s;m of this fever to a &s;udden &s;quall; but the di&s;ea&s;e in its whole cour&s;e was like a tedious equinoctial gale, acting upon a &s;hip at &s;ea; its de&s;tructive force was only to be op|po&s;ed
<PB N="274" REF="027658_0281_0FD7CC4B8B5E2418">
by handing every &s;ail, and leaving the &s;y&s;|tem to float, as it were, under bare poles. Such was the fragility (if I may be allowed the expre&s;|&s;ion) of the blood-ve&s;&s;els, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to unload them of their contents, in order to prevent the &s;y&s;tem &s;inking, from hemorrhagies, or from effu&s;ions in the vi&s;cera, particularly the brain.</P>
<P N="9">9. Such was the indomitable nature of the pul&s;e in &s;ome patients, that it did not lo&s;e its force after numerous and copious bleedings. In all &s;uch ca&s;es, I con&s;idered the diminution of its frequency, and the ab&s;ence of a vomiting, as &s;ignals to lay a&s;ide the lancet. The continuance of this preter|natural force in the pul&s;e, appeared to be owing to the contagion which was univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed in the air, acting upon the arterial &s;y&s;tem in the &s;ame manner that it did in per&s;ons who were in apparent good health.</P>
<P>Thus have I mentioned the principal circum|&s;tances which were connected with blood-letting, in the cure of the yellow fever. I &s;hall now con|&s;ider the objections that were made to it at the time, and &s;ince the prevalence of the fever.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid that the bleeding was unnece&s;&s;arily copious; and that many had been de&s;troyed by it.
<PB N="275" REF="027658_0282_0FD7CC4CD35B69F0">
To this I an&s;wer, that I did not lo&s;e a &s;ingle pati|ent whom I bled &s;even times, or more, in this fe|ver. As a further proof that I did not draw an ounce of blood too much, it will only be nece&s;&s;ary to add, that hemorrhagies frequently occurred af|ter a third, a fourth, and in one in&s;tance (in the only &s;on of Mr William Hall) after a &s;ixth bleed|ing had been u&s;ed; and further, that not a &s;ingle death occurred from natural hemorrhagies in the fir&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;order. A woman who had been bled by my advice, awoke the night follow|ing in a bath of her blood; which had flowed from the orifice in her arm. The next day &s;he was free from pain and fever. There were many recoveries in the city from &s;imilar accidents. There were likewi&s;e &s;ome recoveries from copious na|tural hemorrhagies in the more advanced &s;tages of the di&s;order, particularly when they occurred from the &s;tomach and bowels. I left a &s;ervant maid of Mrs Morris's, in Walnut-&s;treet, who had di&s;|charged at lea&s;t four pounds of blood from her &s;tomach, without a pul&s;e, and with &s;carcely a &s;ymptom that encouraged a hope of her life; but the next day I had the plea&s;ure of finding her out of danger.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that fainting was much le&s;s common after bleeding in this fever, than in com|mon
<PB N="276" REF="027658_0283_0FD7CC4E5426DFE0">
inflammatory fevers. This circum&s;tance was ob&s;erved by Dr Griffitts, as well as my&s;elf. It has &s;ince been confirmed to me by three of the principal bleeders in the city, who performed the operation upwards of four thou&s;and times. It oc|curred chiefly in tho&s;e ca&s;es where it was u&s;ed for the fir&s;t time on the third or fourth day of the di&s;|ea&s;e. A &s;welling of the legs, moreover, &s;o com|mon after plentiful bleeding in pneumony and rheumati&s;m, rarely &s;ucceeded the u&s;e of this reme|dy in the yellow fever.</P>
<P N="2">2. Many of the indi&s;po&s;itions, and much of the &s;ub&s;equent weakne&s;s of per&s;ons who had been cured by copious blood-letting, have been a&s;cribed to it. This is &s;o far from being true, that the re|ver&s;e of it has occurred in many ca&s;es. Mr Mier|ken worked in his &s;ugar-hou&s;e in good health, nine days after his la&s;t bleeding; and Mr Gribble, and Mr George &s;eem by their appearance to have derived fre&s;h vigour from their evacuations. I could mention the names of many people who think their con&s;titutions have been improved by the u&s;e of tho&s;e remedies; and I know &s;everal per|&s;ons in whom they have carried off habitual com|plaints. Mr Richard Wells attributes his relief from a chronic rheumati&s;m to the copious bleed|ing and purging which were u&s;ed to cure him of
<PB N="277" REF="027658_0284_0FD7C897701AE160">
the yellow fever; and Mr William Young, the book&s;eller, was relieved of a chronic pain in his &s;ide, by means of the &s;ame remedies.</P>
<P N="3">3. It was &s;aid, that blood-letting was pre&s;cribed indi&s;criminately in all ca&s;es, without any regard to age, con&s;titution, or the force of the di&s;ea&s;e. This is not true as far as it relates to my practice. In my pre&s;criptions for patients whom I was un|able to vi&s;it, I advi&s;ed them, when they were inca|pable of judging of the &s;tate of the pul&s;e, to be guided in the u&s;e of bleeding, by the degrees of pain they felt, particularly in the head; and I &s;el|dom advi&s;ed it for the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> time, after the &s;econd, or third day of the di&s;order.</P>
<P>In pneumonies which affect whole neighbour|hoods in the &s;pring of the year, bleeding is the univer&s;al remedy. Why &s;hould it not be equally &s;o, in a fever which is of a more uniform inflam|matory nature, and which tends more rapidly to effu&s;ions, in parts of the body, much more vital than the lungs?</P>
<P>I have before remarked, that the debility which occurs in the yellow fever, is of the indirect kind. The debility in the plague is of the &s;ame nature. It has long been known that direct debility is to
<PB N="278" REF="027658_0285_0FD7CC5003A011F0">
be removed by the <HI>gradual</HI> application of &s;timuli, but it has been le&s;s ob&s;erved, that the exce&s;s of &s;timulus in the &s;y&s;tem is be&s;t removed in a <HI>gradual</HI> manner, and that too, in proportion to the de|grees of indirect debility, which exi&s;t in the &s;y&s;|tem.</P>
<P>This principle in the animal economy has been acknowledged by the practice of occa&s;ionally &s;top|ping the di&s;charge of water from a canula in tap|ping, and of blood from a vein, in order to pre|vent fainting.</P>
<P>Child-birth, induces fainting, and &s;ometimes death, only by the <HI>&s;udden</HI> ab&s;traction of the &s;ti|mulus of di&s;tention and pain.</P>
<P>In all tho&s;e ca&s;es where purging or bleeding have produced death in the yellow fever or plague, when they have been u&s;ed on the fir&s;t or &s;econd day of tho&s;e di&s;orders, I &s;u&s;pect that it was oc|ca&s;ioned by the quantity of the &s;timulus ab&s;tracted, being di&s;proportioned to the degrees of indirect debility. The following facts will I hope throw light upon this &s;ubject.</P>

<P N="4">4. There is a di&s;ea&s;e in North Carolina known among the common people by the name of the "pleuri&s;y in the head." It occurs in the winter after a &s;ickly autumn, and &s;eems to be an evane|&s;cent &s;ymptom of a bilious remitting fever. The cure of it has been attempted by bleeding, in the common way, but generally without &s;ucce&s;s.

<P>I have remarked in the hi&s;tory of the yellow fever of la&s;t autumn, that it was often cured on the fir&s;t or &s;econd day by a copious &s;weat. The Rev. Mr U&s;tick was one among many whom I could mention, who were &s;aved from a violent attack of the fever, by this evacuation. It would be ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that the contagion which produced the di&s;ea&s;e, was di&s;charged in this man|ner from the body. The &s;weat &s;eemed to cure the fever, only by le&s;&s;ening the quantity of the fluids, and thus <HI>gradually</HI> removing the indirect debility of the &s;y&s;tem. The profu&s;e &s;weats which &s;ometimes cure the plague, as well as the di&s;ea&s;e which is brought on by the bite of poi&s;onous &s;nakes, &s;eem to act in the &s;ame way.</P>
<P>The &s;y&s;tem under the impre&s;&s;ion of the conta|gion of a malignant fever, re&s;embles a man &s;trug|gling beneath a load of two hundred weight, who is able to lift only one hundred and &s;eventy-five. In order to a&s;&s;i&s;t him it will be to no pur|po&s;e to attempt to infu&s;e additional vigour into his mu&s;cles by the u&s;e of a whip or of &s;trong

drink. Every exertion will &s;erve only to wa&s;te his &s;trength. In this &s;ituation (&s;uppo&s;ing it impo&s;|&s;ible to divide the weight which confines him to the ground) let the pockets of this man be emp|tied of their contents, and let him be &s;tripped of &s;o much of his clothing, as to reduce his weight five and twenty or thirty pounds. In this &s;itua|tion he will ri&s;e from the ground; but if the weights be ab&s;tracted &s;uddenly, while he is in an act of exertion he will ri&s;e with a &s;pring that will endanger a &s;econd fall, and probably produce a temporary convul&s;ion in his &s;y&s;tem. By ab&s;tract|ing the weights from his body more gradually, he will ri&s;e by degrees from the ground, and the &s;y&s;|tem will accommodate it&s;elf in &s;uch a manner to the diminution of its pre&s;&s;ure, as to re&s;ume its erect form, without the lea&s;t deviation from the natural order of its appearance and motions.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid that the &s;timulating remedies of bark, wine, and the cold bath, were proper in our late epidemic in Augu&s;t, and in the beginning of September, but that they were improper after|wards. If my theory be ju&s;t, they were more improper in Augu&s;t and the beginning of Septem|ber, than they were after the di&s;ea&s;e put on the outward and common &s;igns of inflammatory dia|the&s;is. The rea&s;on why a few &s;trong purges cured
<PB N="284" REF="027658_0291_0FD7CC5765111320">
the di&s;ea&s;e at its fir&s;t appearance was, becau&s;e they ab&s;tracted in a <HI>gradual</HI> manner &s;ome of the immen&s;e portion of &s;timulus under which the ar|terial &s;y&s;tem laboured, and thus gradually relieved it from its low degrees of indirect debility. Bleed|ing was fatal in the&s;e ca&s;es, only becau&s;e it re|moved this indirect debility in too &s;udden a man|ner.</P>
<P>The principle of the gradual ab&s;traction, as well as of the gradual application of &s;timuli to the bo|dy, in all the di&s;ea&s;es of indirect debility on the one hand, and of direct, on the other, opens a wide field for the improvement of medicine. Perhaps all the di&s;coveries of future ages will con&s;i&s;t more in a new application of e&s;tabli&s;hed principles, and in new modes of exhibiting old medicines, than in the di&s;covery of new theories, or of new arti|cles of the Materia Medica.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons which induced me to pre&s;cribe purging and bleeding, in &s;o liberal a manner, na|turally led me to recommend COOL and FRESH AIR to my patients. The good effects of it were ob|vious in almo&s;t every ca&s;e in which it was applied. It was equally proper whether the arterial &s;y&s;tem was depre&s;&s;ed, or whether it di&s;covered in the pul&s;e, a high degree of morbid excitement. Dr
<PB N="285" REF="027658_0292_0FD7CC59EDE3E8D8">
Griffiths furni&s;hed a remarkable in&s;tance of the influence of cool air upon the fever. Upon my vi&s;iting him on the morning of the eighth of Oc|tober, I found his pul&s;e &s;o full and ten&s;e, as to in|dicate bleeding, but after &s;itting a few minutes by his bed-&s;ide, I perceived that the windows of his room had been &s;hut in the night by his nur&s;e, on account of the coldne&s;s of the night air. I de&s;ired that they might be opened. In ten minutes af|terwards, the Doctor's pul&s;e became &s;o much &s;lower and weaker, that I advi&s;ed the po&s;tpone|ment of the bleeding, and recommended a purge in&s;tead of it. The bleeding notwith&s;tanding be|came nece&s;&s;ary, and was u&s;ed with great advantage in the afternoon of the &s;ame day.</P>
<P>The cool air was improper only in tho&s;e ca&s;es where a chilline&s;s attended the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;on that I advi&s;ed cool air, I directed my patients to u&s;e cold DRINKS. They con&s;i&s;ted of lemonade, tamarind, jelly, and raw apple water, toa&s;t and water, and of weak balm, and camomile tea. The &s;ubacid drinks were pre|ferred in mo&s;t ca&s;es, as being not only mo&s;t agree|able to the ta&s;te, but becau&s;e they tended to cor|rect by mixture, the acrid quality of the bile. All the&s;e drinks were taken in the early &s;tage of the
<PB N="286" REF="027658_0293_0FD7CC5BD54E9700">
di&s;order. Towards the clo&s;e of it, I permitted the u&s;e of porter and water, weak punch, and when the &s;tomach would bear it, weak wine-whey.</P>
<P>I forbad all cordial and &s;timulating food in the active &s;tate of the arterial &s;y&s;tem. The le&s;s my patients ate, of even the milde&s;t vegetable food, the &s;ooner they recovered. Weak coffee, which (as I have formerly remarked) was almo&s;t univer|&s;ally agreeable, and weak tea were always inoffen|&s;ive. As the action of the pul&s;e dimini&s;hed, I in|dulged my patients with weak chocolate; al&s;o with milk, to which roa&s;ted apples, or minced peaches, and (where they were not to be had,) bread, or Indian mu&s;h were added.</P>
<P>Towards the cri&s;is, I advi&s;ed the drinking of weak chicken, veal, or mutton broth, and after the cri&s;is had taken place, I permitted mild animal food to be eaten in a &s;mall quantity, and to be increa&s;ed according to the wa&s;te of the excita|bility of the &s;y&s;tem. This &s;trict ab&s;tinence which I impo&s;ed upon my patients did not e&s;cape ob|loquy, but the benefits they derived from it, and the ill effects which aro&s;e in many ca&s;es from a contrary regimen, &s;atisfied me that it was proper in every ca&s;e in which it was pre&s;cribed.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="027658_0294_0FD7CC5E12C4C770">
COLD WATER was a mo&s;t agreeable and power|ful remedy in this di&s;order. I directed it to be applied by means of napkins to the head, and to be injected into the bowels by way of gly&s;ter. It gave the &s;ame ea&s;e to both, when in pain, which opium gives to pain from other cau&s;es. I like|wi&s;e advi&s;ed the wa&s;hing of the face and hands, and &s;ometimes the feet with cold water, and always with advantage. It was by &s;uffering the body to lie for &s;ome time in a bed of cold water, that the inhabitants of the i&s;land of Ma&s;&s;uah cured the mo&s;t violent bilious fevers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bruce's Travels.</NOTE>. When applied in this way, it <HI>gradually</HI> ab&s;tracts the heat from the body, and thereby le&s;&s;ens the action of the &s;y&s;tem. It differs as much in its effects upon the body from the cold bath, as re&s;t in a cold room, differs from exerci&s;e in the cold and open air.</P>
<P>I was fir&s;t led to the practice of the partial ap|plication of cold water to the body, in fevers of too much force in the arterial &s;y&s;tem, by ob&s;erv|ing its good effects in active hemorrhagies, and by recollecting the effects of a partial application of warm water to the feet, in fevers of an oppo&s;ite character. Cold water when applied to the feet as certainly reduces the pul&s;e in force and fre|quency,
<PB N="288" REF="027658_0295_0FD7CC62369DCBD8">
as warm water applied in the &s;ame way, produces contrary effects upon it. In an experi|ment which was made at my reque&s;t by one of my pupils, by placing his feet in cold pump water for a few minutes, the pul&s;e was reduced 24 &s;trokes in a minute, and became &s;o weak as hardly to be perceptible.</P>
<P>In the u&s;e of the remedies which were nece&s;&s;ary to overcome the inflammatory action of the &s;y&s;|tem, I was obliged to reduce it below its natural point of excitement. In the pre&s;ent imperfect &s;tate of our knowledge in medicine, perhaps no di&s;ea&s;e of too much action, can be cured without it.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid in another place, that I was early obliged to de&s;i&s;t from the u&s;e of wine, bark, and laudanum in the fir&s;t &s;tage of this di&s;order. I found them as offen&s;ive to the &s;tomach, and nearly as hurt|ful in its &s;econd &s;tage, as I had found them in its fir&s;t. In this &s;ituation new re&s;ources in the ma|teria medica were opened to me. I had ob&s;erved a favourable i&s;&s;ue of the fever in every ca&s;e, in which a &s;pontaneous di&s;charge took place from the &s;alivary glands. I had ob&s;erved further, that all &s;uch of my patients (one excepted) as were &s;a|livated by the mercurial purges recovered in a few

days. This, early &s;ugge&s;ted an idea to me that the calomel might be applied to other purpo&s;es, than the di&s;charging of bile from the bowels. I a&s;cribed its &s;alutary effects when it &s;alivated in the fir&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;order, to the excitement of in|flammation and effu&s;ion in the throat, diverting them from more vital parts of the body. In the the &s;econd &s;tage of the di&s;order, I was led to pre|&s;cribe it as a &s;timulant, and with a view of obtain|ing this operation from it, I aimed at exciting a &s;alivation as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible in all ca&s;es. Two precedents encouraged me to make trial of this remedy.</P>
<P>In the month of October 1789, I attended a gen|tleman in a bilious fever, which ended in many of the &s;ymptoms of a typhus mitior. In the lowe&s;t &s;tate of his fever, he complained of a pain his right &s;ide, for which I ordered half an ounce of mercu|rial ointment to be rubbed on the part affected. The next day, he complained of a &s;ore mouth, and in the cour&s;e of four and twenty hours, he was in a moderate &s;alivation. From this time his pul&s;e became full and &s;low, and his &s;kin moi&s;t. His &s;leep and appetite &s;uddenly returned, and in a day or two he was out of danger. The &s;econd precedent for a &s;alivation in a fever, which occurred to me was in Dr Haller's &s;hort account of the works of
<PB N="290" REF="027658_0297_0FD7CD28C9790C80">
Dr Cramer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bibliotheca Medicinae Practicae, vol. iii. p. 491.</NOTE>, and which I had a year before copied into my note book. The practice was moreover, ju&s;tified in point of &s;afety, as well as the probability of &s;ucce&s;s, by the accounts which Dr Clark has lately given of the effects of a &s;aliva|tion in the dy&s;entery<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Di&s;ea&s;es of long voyages to Hot Climates, vol. ii. p. 334.</NOTE>. I began by pre&s;cribing the the calomel in &s;mall do&s;es, at &s;hort intervals, and afterwards I directed large quantities of the oint|ment to be rubbed upon the limbs. The effects of it in every ca&s;e in which it affected the mouth, were &s;alutary. Dr Woodhou&s;e improved upon my me|thod of exciting the &s;alivation, by rubbing the gums with calomel, in the manner directed by Mr Clare. It was more &s;peedy in its operation in this way than in any other, and equally effectual. Several per|&s;ons appeared to be benefited by the mercury in|troduced into the &s;y&s;tem in the form of an ointment, where it did <HI>not</HI> produce a &s;alivation. Among the&s;e, were the Rev. Dr Blackwell, and Mr John Davis.</P>
<P>Since the above account was written of the good effects <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> mercurial &s;alivation in this fever, I have had great &s;atisfaction in di&s;covering that it was pre|&s;cribed with equal, and even greater &s;ucce&s;s, by Dr Wade in Bengal, in the year 1791, and by Mr Chi&s;holm in the i&s;land of Granada, in the cure of
<PB N="291" REF="027658_0298_0FD7CC65CCF57970">
bilious yellow fevers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Medical Commentaries, vol. xviii. p. 209. 388.</NOTE>. Dr Wade did not lo&s;e one, and Mr Chi&s;holm lo&s;t only one, out of forty eight prtients in whom the mercury affected the &s;alivary glands. The latter gave 150 grains of colomel, and applied the &s;tronge&s;t mercurial ointment below the groin of each &s;ide, in &s;ome ca&s;es. He adds further, that not a &s;ingle in&s;tance of a relap&s;e oc|curred, where the di&s;ea&s;e was cured by &s;alivation.</P>
<P>After the reduction of the &s;y&s;tem, <HI>bli&s;ters</HI> were applied with great advantage to every part of the body. They did mo&s;t &s;ervice when they were ap|plied to the crown of the head. I did not &s;ee a &s;ingle ca&s;e, in which a mortification followed the &s;ore, which was created by a bli&s;ter.</P>
<P>Brandy and water, or porter and water, when agreeable to the &s;tomach, with now and then a cup of chicken broth, were the drinks I pre&s;cribed to a&s;&s;i&s;t in re&s;toring the tone of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>In &s;ome ca&s;es I directed the limbs to be wrapped in flannels dipped in warm &s;pirits, and catapla&s;ms of brui&s;ed garlic to be applied to the feet. But my principal dependence, next to the u&s;e of mer|curial medicines, for exciting a healthy action in the arterial &s;y&s;tem, was upon mild and gently &s;ti|mulating
<PB N="292" REF="027658_0299_0FD7CC672AFD5348">
food. This con&s;i&s;ted of rich broths, the fle&s;h of poultry, oy&s;ters, thick gruel, mu&s;h and milk, and chocolate. I directed my patients to eat or drink a portion of &s;ome of the above ar|ticles of diet every hour or two during the day, and in ca&s;es of great debility, I advi&s;ed their being waked for the &s;ame purpo&s;e two or three times in the night. The appetite frequently craved more &s;avoury articles of food, &s;uch as beef-&s;takes, and &s;au&s;ages; but they were permitted with great caution, and never 'till the &s;y&s;tem had been pre|pared for them by a le&s;s &s;timulating diet.</P>
<P>There were &s;everal <HI>&s;ymptoms</HI> which were very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing in this di&s;order, and which required a &s;pecific treatment.</P>
<P>For the vomiting, with a burning &s;en&s;ation in the &s;tomach, which came on about the 5th day, I found no remedy equal to a table &s;poonful of &s;weet milk taken every hour, or to &s;mall draughts of milk and water. I was led to pre&s;cribe this &s;imple medicine, from having heard from a We&s;t India practitioner, and afterwards read in Dr Hume's account of the yellow fever, encomiums upon the milk of the cocoa-nut for this trouble|&s;ome &s;ymptom. Where &s;weet milk failed of giving relief, I pre&s;cribed &s;mall do&s;es of &s;weet oil, and in &s;ome ca&s;es a mixture of equal parts of milk, &s;weet
<PB N="293" REF="027658_0300_0FD7C8A73490CD68">
oil and mola&s;&s;es. They were all intended to di|lute, or blunt the acrimony of the humors which were either effu&s;ed, or generated in the &s;tomach. Where they all failed of checking the vomiting, I pre&s;cribed weak camomile tea, or porter, or cy|der and water, with advantage. In &s;ome of my pa|tients, the &s;tomach rejected all the mixtures, and liquors which have been mentioned. In &s;uch ca&s;es, I directed the &s;tomach to be left to it&s;elf for a few hours, after which it &s;ometimes received and re|tained the drinks that it had before rejected, pro|vided they were admini&s;tered in a &s;mall quantity at a time.</P>
<P>The vomiting was &s;ometimes &s;topped by a bli&s;ter applied to the external region of the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>A mixture of liquid laudanum and &s;weet oil, applied to the &s;ame place, gave relief where the &s;tomach, was affected by pain only, without a vomiting.</P>
<P>I have formerly mentioned that a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing <HI>pain</HI> often &s;eized the lower part of the <HI>bowels.</HI> I was early taught that laudanum was not a pro|per remedy for it.

In a publication dated the 16th of September, I recommended a diet of milk and vegetables, and cooling purges to be taken once or twice a week, to the citizens of Philadelphia. This advice was the re&s;ult of the theory of the di&s;ea&s;e I had adopt|ed, and of the &s;ucce&s;sful practice which had ari&s;en from it. In my intercour&s;e with my fellow citi|zens, I advi&s;ed this regimen to be regulated by the degrees of fatigue and contagion to which they were expo&s;ed. I likewi&s;e advi&s;ed moderate blood-letting to all &s;uch per&s;ons as were of a ple|thoric habit. To men who&s;e minds were influ|enced by the publications in favour of bark and wine, and who were unable at that time to gra&s;p the extent and force of the contagion of this ter|rible fever, the idea of dieting, purging, or bleed|ing the inhabitants of a whole village or city, ap|peared to be extravagant and ab&s;urd: but I had many precedents, be&s;ides the authority of rea&s;on, in favour of the advice. Dr Mitchell recommend|ed moderate bleeding with &s;ucce&s;s, as a preventive of the yellow fever in Virginia, in the year 1741. A military &s;urgeon belonging to the French troops at Hi&s;paniola, a&s;&s;ured Dr Foulke that he had for many years bled the recruits from France, as &s;oon as they arrived, and thereby &s;ecured them from a &s;ea&s;oning by the yellow fever.

than in the Engli&s;h I&s;lands, has been ju&s;tly attributed to the natives of France and Spain car|rying with them to the We&s;t Indies more tempe|rate habits, in the u&s;e of wine and animal food, than the natives of Great Britain. I had more|over, the analogy of the regimen made u&s;e of to prepare the body for the &s;mall-pox and plague, in favour of this advice. Dr Haller has given extracts from the hi&s;tories of two plagues, in which the action of the contagion was prevented, or mitigated, by bleeding<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bibliotheca Medicinae Practicae, vol. ii. p. 93, and 387.</NOTE>. Dr Hodges con|firms the utility of the &s;ame practice. The bene|fits of low diet, as a preventive of the plague, were e&s;tabli&s;hed by many authors, long before they received the te&s;timony of the benevolent Mr Howard in their favour. Socrates in Athens, and Ju&s;tinian in Con&s;tantinople, were pre&s;erved by means of their ab&s;temious modes of living, from the plagues which occa&s;ionally ravaged tho&s;e ci|ties. By means of the low diet, gentle phy&s;ic, and occa&s;ional bleedings, which I thus publicly recom|mended, the di&s;ea&s;e was prevented in many in|&s;tances, or rendered mild where it was taken. But my efforts to prevent the di&s;ea&s;e in my fel|low-citizens, did not end here. I advi&s;ed them, not only in the public papers, but in my inter|cour&s;e
<PB N="297" REF="027658_0304_0FD7CC7192A4F6E8">
with them, to avoid heat, cold, labour, and every thing el&s;e that could excite the conta|gion (which I knew to be pre&s;ent in all their bo|dies) into action. I forgot upon this occa&s;ion the u&s;ual laws which regulate the intercour&s;e of man with man in the &s;treets, and upon the public roads, in my excur&s;ions into the neighbourhood of the city. I cautioned many per&s;ons whom I &s;aw walking or riding in an un&s;afe manner, of the danger to which they expo&s;ed them&s;elves; and thereby I hope prevented an attack of the di&s;or|der in many people. If in a &s;ingle in&s;tance I un|happily excited an emotion of terror in a fellow-citizen, by this conduct, I thus publicly a&s;k his pardon. There &s;hould be no ceremony in cal|ling to a man to avoid a precipice; or in pulling him out of a fire.</P>
<P>It was from a conviction of the utility of low diet, gentle evacuations, and of carefully &s;hunning all the exciting cau&s;es which I have mentioned, that I concealed in no in&s;tance from my patients, the name of their di&s;order. This plainne&s;s, which was blamed by weak people, produced &s;trict obe|dience to my directions, and thereby limited the propagation of the fever in many families, or rendered it when taken, as mild as inoculation does the &s;mall-pox. The oppo&s;ite conduct of &s;e|veral
<PB N="298" REF="027658_0305_0FD7CC77DD13D518">
phy&s;icians, by preventing the above precau|tions, encrea&s;ed the mortality of the di&s;ea&s;e; and in &s;ome in&s;tances contributed to the extinction of whole families. Such have been, and ever will be, the effects of ignorance and fraud in the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of medicine.</P>
<P>I proceed now to make a few remarks upon the remedies recommended by Doctors Kuhn and Stevens, and by the French phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>Had the whole materia medica been ran&s;acked, there could not have been found any three medi|cines more oppo&s;ite to the di&s;order than bark, wine, and laudanum. In every ca&s;e in which I pre|&s;cribed bark, it was offen&s;ive to the &s;tomach. In &s;everal tertians which attended the convale&s;cence from a common attack of the fever, I found it al|ways un&s;ucce&s;sful, and once hurtful. Mr Wil|ling took it for &s;everal weeks without effect. About half a pint of a weak decoction of the bark produced in Mr Samuel Meredith, a parox|i&s;m of the fever, &s;o violent as to require the lo&s;s of ten ounces of blood to moderate it. Dr An|nan informed me that he was forced to bleed one of his patients twice, after having given him a &s;mall quantity of bark, to ha&s;ten his convale&s;cence. If in any ca&s;e it was inoffen&s;ive, or did &s;ervice, I
<PB N="299" REF="027658_0306_0FD7CC79F5195E58">
&s;u&s;pect it mu&s;t have acted upon the bowels as a purge. Dr Sydenham &s;ays the bark cured inter|mittents by this evacuation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 440.</NOTE>; and Mr Bruce &s;ays it operated in the &s;ame way, when it cured the bi|lious fevers at Ma&s;&s;uah.</P>
<P><HI>Wine</HI> was nearly as di&s;agreeable as the bark to the &s;tomach, and equally hurtful. I tried it in every form, and of every quality, but without &s;uc|ce&s;s. It was either rejected by the &s;tomach, or produced in it a burning &s;en&s;ation. I &s;hould &s;u&s;|pect that I had been mi&s;taken in my complaints again&s;t wine, had I not &s;ince met with an account in Skenkius of its having de&s;troyed all who took it in the famous Hungarian fever, which prevailed with great mortality over nearly every country in Europe, about the middle of the 16th century<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Omnes qui vini potione non ab&s;tinuerunt, interiere, adeo ut &s;umma &s;pes &s;alvationis in vini ab&s;tinentia collocata videreter. Lib. vi. p. 847.</NOTE>. Dr Wade declares wine to be "ill adapted to the fevers of Bengal, where the treatment has been proper in other re&s;pects."</P>
<P><HI>Laudanum</HI> has been called by Dr Mo&s;ely "a fatal medicine" in the yellow fever. In one of
<PB N="300" REF="027658_0307_0FD7C8AB172BF608">
my patients who took only fifteen drops of it, without my advice, to ea&s;e a pain in his bowels, it produced a delirium, and death in a few hours. I was much gratified in di&s;covering that my prac|tice, with re&s;pect to the u&s;e of opium in this fe|ver, accorded with Dr Wade's in the fever of Bengal. He tells us that "it was mi&s;chievous in almo&s;t every in&s;tance, even in combination with antimonials."</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;pices</HI> were hurtful in the fir&s;t &s;tage of the fever, and when &s;ufficient evacuations had been u&s;ed, they were &s;eldom nece&s;&s;ary in its &s;econd.</P>
<P>The <HI>elixir of vitriol</HI> was in general, offen&s;ive to the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>The <HI>cold bath</HI> was u&s;eful in tho&s;e ca&s;es where its &s;edative prevailed over its &s;timulating effects. But this could not often happen, from the &s;ud|denne&s;s and force with which the water was thrown upon the body. In two ca&s;es in which I pre&s;cribed it, it produced a gentle &s;weat, but it did not &s;ave life. In a third it removed a deliri|um, and reduced the pul&s;e for a few minutes, in frequency and force, but this patient died. The recommendation of it indi&s;criminately in all ca&s;es was extremely improper. In that chilline&s;s and
<PB N="301" REF="027658_0308_0FD7CC7B532C0520">
tendency to fainting upon the lea&s;t motion, which attended the di&s;order in &s;ome patients, it was an un&s;afe remedy. I heard of a woman who was &s;eized with delirium immediately after u&s;ing it, from which &s;he never recovered; and of a man who died a few minutes after he came out of a bathing tub. Had this remedy been the exclu|&s;ive antidote to the yellow fever, the mortality of the di&s;ea&s;e would have been but little checked by it. Thou&s;ands mu&s;t have peri&s;hed from the want of means to procure tubs, and of a &s;uitable number of attendants to apply the water, and to lift the patient in and out of bed. The rea&s;on of our citizens ran before the learning of the friends of this remedy, and long before it was abandoned by the phy&s;icians; it was rejected as u&s;ele&s;s, or not attempted, becau&s;e impracticable, by the good &s;en&s;e of the city. It is to be lamented that the remedy of cold water has &s;uffered in its cha|racter by the manner in which it was advi&s;ed. In fevers of too much action, it reduces the morbid excitement of the blood-ve&s;&s;els, provided it be <HI>applied without force,</HI> and for a con&s;iderable time to the body. It is in the jail fever, and in the &s;econd &s;tage of the yellow fever only, in which its &s;timulant and tonic powers are proper. Dr Jack&s;on e&s;tabli&s;hes this mode of u&s;ing it, by in|forming
<PB N="302" REF="027658_0309_0FD7CC826209F570">
us, that when it did &s;ervice, it "gave vi|gour and tone" to the &s;y&s;tem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fevers of Jamaica.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> mode of practice which I mentioned in this fever con&s;i&s;ted of a union of the evacuating, and tonic remedies. The phy&s;icians who adopted this mode, gave calomel by it&s;elf in &s;mall do&s;es on the fir&s;t, or &s;econd day of the fever, bled once or twice in a &s;paring manner, and gave the bark, wine, and laudanum in large quantities upon the fir&s;t appearance of a remi&s;&s;ion. After they began the u&s;e of the&s;e remedies, purging was omitted, or if the bowels were moved, it was only by means of gentle gly&s;ters. This practice I &s;hall &s;ay hereafter was not much more &s;ucce&s;sful than that which was recommended by Dr Kuhn and Dr Stevens. It re&s;embled throwing water and oil at the &s;ame time upon a fire, in order to ex|tingui&s;h it.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> remedies were nitre, and cremor tartar in &s;mall do&s;es, centaury tea, camphor, and &s;everal other warm medicines; &s;ubacid drinks taken in large quantities, the warm bath, and moderate bleeding.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="027658_0310_0FD7C8AC39D5FFF0">
After what has been &s;aid, it mu&s;t be obvious to the reader, that the nitre and cremor tartar in &s;mall do&s;es, could do no good, and that camphor and all cordial medicines mu&s;t have done harm. The diluting &s;ubacid drinks which the French phy&s;icians gave in large quantities were u&s;eful in diluting and blunting the acrimony of the bile, and to this remedy a&s;&s;i&s;ted by occa&s;ional bleeding, I a&s;cribe mo&s;t of the cures which were performed by tho&s;e phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e few per&s;ons in whom the <HI>warm bath</HI> pro|duced copious and univer&s;al &s;weats recovered, but in nearly all the ca&s;es which came under my no|tice, it did harm.</P>
<P>I come now to inquire into the comparative &s;ucce&s;s of the <HI>four</HI> different modes of practice which have been mentioned.</P>
<P>I have already &s;aid that ten out of thirteen pati|ents whom I treated with bark, wine, and lauda|num, and that three out of four, in whom I added the cold bath to tho&s;e remedies, died. Dr Pen|nington informed me, that he had lo&s;t all the pa|tients, (&s;ix in number) to whom he had given the above medicines. Dr John&s;on a&s;&s;ured me with great concern, about two weeks before he died,
<PB N="304" REF="027658_0311_0FD7C8ADA65798F8">
that he had not recovered a &s;ingle patient by them. Whole families were &s;wept off, where the&s;e me|dicines were u&s;ed. But further, mo&s;t of tho&s;e per&s;ons who caught the fever in the city, and &s;ick|ened in the country, or in the neighbouring towns, and who were treated with tonic remedies, died. There was not a &s;ingle cure performed by them in New York, where they were u&s;ed with every po&s;&s;ible advantage. But why do I multiply proofs of their deadly effects? The clamours of hundreds who&s;e relations had peri&s;hed by them, and the fears of others, compelled tho&s;e phy&s;icians who had been mo&s;t attached to them, to lay them a&s;ide, or to prepare the way for them (as it was called) by purging and bleeding. The bathing tub &s;oon &s;hared a wor&s;e fate than bark, wine, and lauda|num, and long before the di&s;ea&s;e di&s;appeared, it was di&s;carded by all the phy&s;icians in the city.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the&s;e facts, we have been told that Mr Hamilton, and his family recovered by the u&s;e of Dr Stevens's remedies. I &s;hall not &s;ay of tho&s;e cures, what &s;ome gentlemen of the faculty who had &s;een but little of the di&s;ea&s;e, and who had for|gotten that a powerful epidemic bani&s;hes, or unites with all other di&s;ea&s;es, have &s;aid of my cures, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that they were not of the yellow fever. It was impo&s;&s;ible for Mr Hamilton to have had a fever
<PB N="305" REF="027658_0312_0FD7CC83DAA2B5D8">
at that time of any other kind. The neighbour|hood in which he lived, was healthy, and he had been daily expo&s;ed at his office in Che&s;nut-&s;treet, to the contagion of the prevailing epidemic. The di&s;ea&s;e in this ca&s;e was either very light, or Mr Hamilton owes more to the &s;trength of his con&s;ti|tution, and the goodne&s;s of heaven, than mo&s;t of the people who recovered from the di&s;order. That it was light in all the branches of Mr Hamilton's family who were infected by him, I infer from this being the ca&s;e in every &s;imilar in&s;tance in which the di&s;ea&s;e &s;pread in the country.</P>
<P>"Succe&s;s (&s;ays Dr Sydenham) is not a &s;ufficient proof of the excellency of a method of cure in acute di&s;ea&s;es, &s;ince &s;ome are recovered by the im|prudent procedure of old women; but it is fur|ther required, that the di&s;temper &s;hould be <HI>ea&s;ily cured,</HI> and yield conformably to its <HI>own</HI> nature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 254.</NOTE>," and again, &s;peaking of the cure of the new fever of 1685, this incomparable phy&s;ician ob&s;erves, "If it be objected, that this fever frequently yields to a quite contrary method to that which I have laid down, I an&s;wer, that the cure of a di&s;ea&s;e by a method which is attended with &s;ucce&s;s only <HI>now</HI> and <HI>then</HI> in a <HI>few</HI> in&s;tances, differs extremely from
<PB N="306" REF="027658_0313_0FD7CC876BBDE040">
that practical method, the efficacy whereof appears both from its recovering <HI>greater numbers,</HI> and all the practical phenomena happening in the cure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 354.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>After what has been &s;aid of Mr Hamilton's cure, it will not be expected that I &s;hould &s;ay any thing of the three patients mentioned in Dr Kuhn's letter to the mayor who recovered under the u&s;e of Dr Stevens's remedies. The fourth patient mentioned by Dr Kuhn, whom he left on the 4th day of the di&s;ea&s;e with "no unfavourable &s;ymp|toms" was Dr Hutchin&s;on. I vi&s;ited him the day after Dr Kuhn left him, and found him &s;itting in a chair near the head of his bed, with all his clothes on, as if he had been in his u&s;ual health. A &s;hort examination of his ca&s;e, &s;atisfied me that he was in extreme danger. His face was &s;uffu&s;ed with blood. He had a full pul&s;e, and an hemor|rhage from his gums, which la&s;t &s;ymptom I was told came on the day before. I pre&s;&s;ed him to take a &s;trong mercurial purge, but he refu&s;ed it. From that moment I de&s;paired of his recovery. He died three days afterwards.</P>
<P>The reader will naturally pau&s;e after reviewing the&s;e remarks upon the above cures, and a&s;k,
<PB N="307" REF="027658_0314_0FD7C8B1849CE498">
whether it was con&s;i&s;tent with the rules of ju&s;t and &s;afe rea&s;oning in medicine, to deduce a general and uniform method of treating this di&s;order, from the favourable i&s;&s;ue of only four or five ca&s;es, and whether it was candid, to condemn in the mo&s;t un|qualified manner, a contrary mode of practice, after repeated public, and private declarations, that it had at that time, cured &s;everal hundred people.</P>
<P>Far be it from me to deny that indirect debility may not be overcome by &s;uch &s;timuli as are more powerful than tho&s;e which occa&s;ion it. This has &s;ometimes been demon&s;trated by the efficacy of bark, wine, and laudanum, in the confluent and petechial &s;mall-pox; but even this &s;tate of that di&s;|order, yields more ea&s;ily to blood-letting, or to plentiful evacuations from the &s;tomach and bowels on the fir&s;t or &s;econd day of the eruptive fever. This I have often proved, by giving a large do&s;e of tartar emetic, and calomel, as &s;oon as I was &s;a|tisfied from circum&s;tances, that my patient was in|fected with the &s;mall-pox. But the indirect debi|lity of the yellow fever appears to be much greater than that which occurs in the &s;mall-pox, and hence it more uniformly re&s;i&s;ted the mo&s;t power|ful tonic remedies.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="027658_0315_0FD7C937AF50E658">
I have publicly a&s;&s;erted, that the remedies which I adopted, and of which I have given a hi&s;tory, cured a greater proportion than ninety-nine out of an hundred of all who applied to me on the fir&s;t day of the di&s;order before the 15th day of September. I regret that it is not in my power to furni&s;h a li&s;t of them, for a majority of them were poor people, who&s;e names are &s;till unknown to me. I was not &s;ingular in this &s;ucce&s;sful prac|tice in the fir&s;t appearance of the di&s;order. Dr Penington a&s;&s;ured me on his death bed, that he had not lo&s;t one, out of forty-eight patients whom he had treated agreeably to the principles and practice I had recommended. Dr Griffitts tri|umphed over the di&s;ea&s;e in every part of the city, by the u&s;e of what were called the new remedies. My former pupils &s;pread by their &s;ucce&s;s, the re|putation of purging, and bleeding, wherever they were called. Unhappily the plea&s;ure we derived from this &s;ucce&s;s in the treatment of the di&s;order, was of &s;hort duration. Many circum&s;tances con|tributed to le&s;&s;en it, and to revive the mortality of the fever. I &s;hall briefly enumerate them.</P>
<P N="1">1. The di&s;traction produced in the public mind, by the recommendation of remedies, the oppo&s;ites in every re&s;pect of purging and bleeding.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="309" REF="027658_0316_0FD7CC8A729C19B8">
2. The opinion which had been publi&s;hed by &s;everal phy&s;icians, and inculcated by others, that we had other fevers in the city be&s;ides the yellow fever. This produced a delay in many people in &s;ending for a phy&s;ician, or in taking medicines for two or three days, from a belief that they had nothing but a cold, or a common fever. Some people were &s;o much deceived by this opinion, that they refu&s;ed to &s;end for phy&s;icians le&s;t they &s;hould be infected by them, with the yellow fever. In mo&s;t of the ca&s;es in which the&s;e delays took place, the di&s;ea&s;e proved mortal.</P>
<P>To obviate a &s;u&s;picion, that I have lave laid more &s;tre&s;s upon the fatal influence of this error than is ju&s;t, I &s;hall here in&s;ert an extract of a letter I have lately been favoured with from Mr John Connelly one of the city committee, who fre|quently left his brethren in the City Hall, and &s;pent many hours in vi&s;iting and pre&s;cribing for the &s;ick. "The publications (&s;ays he) of &s;ome phy&s;icians that there were but few per&s;ons infected with the yellow fever, and that many were ill with colds and common remitting and fall fevers, proved fa|tal to almo&s;t every family which was credulous enough to believe them.

&s;tage of the di&s;order, and beyond the power of medicine."</P>
<P N="3">3. The interference of the friends of the &s;ti|mulating &s;y&s;tem, in di&s;&s;uading patients from &s;ub|mitting to &s;ufficient evacuations.</P>
<P N="4">4. The deceptions which were practi&s;ed by &s;ome patients upon their phy&s;icians in their re|ports of the quantity of blood they had lo&s;t, or of the quality, and number of their evacuations by &s;tool.</P>
<P N="5">5. The impracticability of procuring bleeders as &s;oon as bleeding was pre&s;cribed. Life in this di&s;ea&s;e, as in the apoplexy, frequently turned upon that operation being performed within an <HI>hour.</HI> It was often delayed from the want of a bleeder, one or two days.</P>
<P N="6">6. The inability of phy&s;icians, from the num|ber of their patients, and from frequent indi&s;po&s;i|tion, to vi&s;it the &s;ick, at &s;uch times, as was nece&s;|&s;ary to watch the changes in their di&s;order.</P>
<P N="7">7. The great accumulation, and concentration of the contagion in &s;ick rooms from the continu|ance of the di&s;ea&s;e in the city, whereby the &s;y&s;tem
<PB N="311" REF="027658_0318_0FD7CC8CAE532950">
was expo&s;ed to a con&s;tant &s;timulus, and the effect of evacuations was thus defeated.</P>
<P N="8">8. The want of &s;kill or fidelity in nur&s;es to ad|mini&s;ter the medicines properly, to per&s;uade pa|tients to drink frequently; al&s;o to &s;upply them with food or cordial drinks when required in the night.</P>
<P N="9">9. The great degrees of indirect debility in|duced in the &s;y&s;tems of many of the people who were affected by the di&s;order, from fatigue in at|tending their relations or friends.</P>
<P N="10">10. The univer&s;al depre&s;&s;ion of mind, amounting in &s;ome in&s;tances to de&s;pair, which affected many people. What medicine could act upon a patient who awoke in the night, and &s;aw through the broken and faint light of a candle, no human creature, but a black nur&s;e, perhaps a&s;leep in a di&s;tant corner of the room; and who heard no noi&s;e, but that of a her&s;e conveying, perhaps a neighbour or a friend, to the grave? The &s;tate of mind under which many were affected by the di&s;|ea&s;e, is &s;o well de&s;cribed by the Rev. Dr Smith in the ca&s;e of his wife, in a letter I received from him in my &s;ick room, two days after her death, that I hope I &s;hall be execu&s;ed for in&s;erting an
<PB N="312" REF="027658_0319_0FD7C8B76724DFC0">
extract from it. It forms a part of the hi&s;tory of the di&s;ea&s;e. The letter was written in an&s;wer to a &s;hort note of condolence which I &s;ent to the Doctor immediately after hearing of Mrs Smith's death. After &s;ome pathetic expre&s;&s;ions of grief, he adds, "The &s;cene of her funeral, and &s;ome preceding circum&s;tances, can never depart from my mind. On our return from a vi&s;it to our daughter, whom we had been &s;triving to con&s;ole on the death of Mrs Keppele, who was long fa|miliar, and dear to both, my dear wife pa&s;&s;ing the burying ground gate, led me into the ground, view|ed the graves of her two children, called the old grave digger, marked a &s;pot for her&s;elf as clo&s;e as po&s;&s;ible to them and the grave of Dr Phineas Bond, who&s;e memory &s;he adored. Then by the &s;ide of the &s;pot &s;he had cho&s;en, we found room and cho&s;e <HI>mine,</HI> pledging our&s;elves to each other, and directing the grave digger that this &s;hould be the order of our interment. We returned to our hou&s;e. Night approached. I hoped my dear wife had gone to re&s;t as &s;he had cho&s;en &s;ince her return from nur&s;ing her daughter, to &s;leep in a chamber by her&s;elf, through fear of infecting her grand-child and me. But it &s;eems &s;he clo&s;ed not her eyes; &s;itting with them fixed through her chamber window on Mrs Keppele's hou&s;e, 'till about midnight &s;he &s;aw her her&s;e, and followed it
<PB N="313" REF="027658_0320_0FD7CC908BCCDFC0">
with her eyes as far as it could be &s;een. Two days afterwards Mrs Rodgers, her next only &s;ur|viving intimate friend, was carried pa&s;t her win|dow, and by no per&s;ua&s;ion could I draw her from thence, nor &s;top her &s;ympathetic foreboding tears, &s;o long as her eyes could follow the funeral, which was through two &s;quares, from Fourth to Second &s;treet, where the her&s;e di&s;appeared." The Doc|tor proceeds in de&s;cribing the di&s;tre&s;s of his wife. But pointed as his expre&s;&s;ions are, they do not convey the gloomy &s;tate of her mind with &s;o much force as &s;he has done it her&s;elf in two letters to her niece Mrs Cadwallader, who was then in the country. The one was dated the 9th, the other the 11th of October. I &s;hall in&s;ert a few extracts from each of them. "October 9th; It is not po&s;&s;ible for me to pa&s;s the &s;treets without walking in a line with the dead. Pa&s;&s;ing infected hou&s;es, and looking into open graves.

&s;ubjects which will admit of "innovation" in medicine.</P>
<P>After the 15th of September my &s;ucce&s;s was much limited, compared with what it had been before that time. But at no period of the di&s;ea&s;e did I lo&s;e more than one in twenty of tho&s;e whom I &s;aw on the fir&s;t day, and attended regularly through every &s;tage of the fever; provided they had not been previou&s;ly worn down by attending the &s;ick.</P>
<P>The following &s;tatement which will admit of being corrected, if it be inaccurate, will I hope, e&s;tabli&s;h the truth of the above a&s;&s;ertions.</P>
<P>About one half of the families whom I have at|tended for many years, left the city. Of tho&s;e who remained, many were affected by the di&s;or|der. Out of the whole of them, after I had adopted my &s;econd mode of practice, I lo&s;t only five heads of families, and about a dozen &s;ervants and children. In no in&s;tance did I lo&s;e both heads of the &s;ame family. My &s;ucce&s;s in the&s;e ca&s;es was owing to two cau&s;es; 1&s;t, To the credit my for|mer patients gave to my public declaration, that we had only <HI>one</HI> fever in the city; hence they ap|plied
<PB N="316" REF="027658_0323_0FD7CC967B73E110">
on the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> day, and &s;ometimes on the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> hour of their indi&s;po&s;ition; and 2dly, To the nu|merous pledges many of them had &s;een of the &s;afety and efficacy of copious blood-letting by my advice, in other di&s;ea&s;es: hence my pre&s;cription of that nece&s;&s;ary remedy, was always obeyed in its utmo&s;t extent. Of the few adults whom I lo&s;t, among my former patients, two of them were old people; two took laudanum without my know|ledge; and one refu&s;ed to take medicine of any kind; all the re&s;t had been worn down by previ|ous fatigue.</P>
<P>I have before &s;aid that a great number of the blacks were my patients. Of the&s;e not one died under my care. This uniform &s;ucce&s;s among tho&s;e people, was not owing altogether to the mildne&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e, for I &s;hall &s;ay pre&s;ently, that a great proportion of a given number died under other modes of practice.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of the comparative effects of purg|ing and bleeding, it may not be ami&s;s to repeat, that not one pregnant woman to whom I pre|&s;cribed them died, or &s;uffered abortion. Where the tonic remedies were u&s;ed, abortion or death, and in many in&s;tances both, were nearly univer&s;al.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="027658_0324_0FD7CC9DCF9FC180">
Many whole families, con&s;i&s;ting of five, &s;ix, and in three in&s;tances, of nine members, were recover|ed by plentiful purging and bleeding. I could &s;well this work by publi&s;hing a li&s;t of tho&s;e fami|lies; but I take more plea&s;ure in adding, that I was not &s;ingular in my &s;ucce&s;s in the u&s;e of the above remedies. They were pre&s;cribed with great advantage by many of the phy&s;icians of the city, who had for a while given tonic medicines without effect. I &s;hall not mention the names of any of the phy&s;icians who <HI>totally</HI> renounced tho&s;e medicines, le&s;t I &s;hould give offence by not men|tioning them all. Many large families were cured by &s;ome of them, after they adopted and pre|&s;cribed copious purging and blood-letting. One of them cured ten in the family of Mr Robert Haydock, by means of tho&s;e remedies. In one of that family the di&s;ea&s;e came on with a vomit|ing of black bile.</P>
<P>But the u&s;e of the new remedies was not di|rected finally by the phy&s;icians alone. The cler|gy, the apothecaries, many private citizens, &s;eve|ral intelligent women, and two black men, pre&s;crib|ed them with great &s;ucce&s;s. Nay more, many per|&s;ons pre&s;cribed them to them&s;elves; and as I &s;hall &s;ay hereafter, with a &s;ucce&s;s that was unequalled by any of the regular or irregular practitioners in the city.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="027658_0325_0FD7CC9F64003F60">
It was owing to the almo&s;t univer&s;al u&s;e of purging and bleeding, that the mortality of the di&s;ea&s;e dimini&s;hed in proportion as the number of per&s;ons who were affected by it, encrea&s;ed about the middle of October. It was &s;carcely double of what it was in the middle of September, and yet &s;ix times the number of per&s;ons were probably at that time confined by it.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of copious purging and bleeding was not confined to the city of Philadelphia. Se|veral per&s;ons who caught the di&s;ea&s;e in town, and &s;ickened in the country, were cured by them.</P>
<P>Could a compari&s;on be made of the number of patients who died of our late fever, after having been plentifully bled and purged, with tho&s;e who died of the yellow fever in the years 1699, 1741, 1747, and 1762, I am per&s;uaded that the propor|tion would be very &s;mall in the year 1793, com|pared with the former years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It appears from one of Mr Norris's letters, dated the 9th of November, O. S. that there died 220 per&s;ons in the year 1699, with the yellow fever. Between 80 and 90 of them he &s;ays belonged to the &s;ociety of Friends. The city at this time probably did not contain more than 2 or 3000 people, many of whom it is probable fled from the di&s;order.</NOTE>. Including all who died under every mode of treatment, I &s;u&s;pect the
<PB N="319" REF="027658_0326_0FD7CCA192E6E5D0">
mortality to be le&s;s in proportion to the popula|tion of the city, and the number of per&s;ons who were affected, than it was in any of the other years that have been mentioned.</P>
<P>Not le&s;s than 6000 of the inhabitants of Phila|delphia probably owe their lives to purging and bleeding, during the late autumn.</P>
<P>I proceed with reluctance to inquire into the comparative &s;ucce&s;s of the French practice. It would not be difficult to decide upon it from ma|ny facts that came under my notice in the city; but I &s;hall re&s;t its merit wholly upon the returns of the number of deaths at Bu&s;h-hill. This ho&s;pi|tal, after the 22d of September, was put under the care of a French phy&s;ician, who was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by one of the phy&s;icians of the city. The ho&s;pital was in a plea&s;ant and airy &s;ituation; it was provided with all the nece&s;&s;aries and comforts for &s;ick peo|ple that humanity could invent, or liberality &s;up|ply. The attendants were devoted to their duty; and cleanline&s;s and order pervaded every room in the hou&s;e. The reputation of this ho&s;pital, and of the French phy&s;ician, drew patients to it in the early &s;tage of the di&s;order. Of this I have been a&s;&s;ured in a letter from Dr Annan, who was ap|pointed to examine and give orders of admi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="320" REF="027658_0327_0FD7C8BBAAD600E0">
into the ho&s;pital, to &s;uch of the poor of the di|&s;trict of Southwark, as could not be taken care of in their own hou&s;es. Mr Olden has likewi&s;e in|formed me, that mo&s;t of the patients who were &s;ent to the ho&s;pital by the city committee (of which he was a member) were in the fir&s;t &s;tage of the fever. With all the&s;e advantages, the deaths between the 22d of September and the 6th of November, amounted to 448 out of 807 pati|ents who were admitted into the ho&s;pital within that time. Three fourths of all the blacks (near|ly 20) who were patients in this ho&s;pital died. A li&s;t of the medicines pre&s;cribed there may be &s;een in the minutes of the proceedings of the city committee. Calomel and jalap are not among them. <HI>Moderate</HI> bleeding and purging with Glauber &s;alts, I have been informed, were u&s;ed in &s;ome ca&s;es by the phy&s;icians of this ho&s;pital. The proportion of deaths to the recoveries, as it appears in the minutes of the committee from whence the above report is taken, is truly melan|choly! I hurry from it therefore to a part of this work, to which I have looked with plea&s;ure, ever &s;ince I &s;at down to compo&s;e it.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid that the clergy, the apothecaries, and many other per&s;ons who were unin&s;tructed in the principles of medicine, pre&s;cribed purging, and
<PB N="321" REF="027658_0328_0FD7CCA75BDA66D0">
bleeding with great &s;ucce&s;s in this di&s;order. Ne|ce&s;&s;ity gave ri&s;e to this undi&s;ciplined &s;ect of practi|tioners, for they came forward to &s;upply the places of the regular bred phy&s;icians who were &s;ick or dead. I &s;hall mention the names of a few of tho&s;e per&s;ons who di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves as volunteers in this new work of humanity. The late Rev. Mr Fleming one of the mini&s;ters of the Catholic church, carried the purging powders in his pocket, and gave them to his poor pari&s;hioners with great &s;ucce&s;s. He even became the advocate of the new remedies. In a conver&s;ation I had with him on the 22d of September, he informed me, that he had advi&s;ed four of our phy&s;icians whom he met a day or two before, "to renounce the pride of &s;cience, and to adopt the new mode of practice, for that he had witne&s;&s;ed its good effects in many ca&s;es." Mr John Keihmle, a German apothecary, has a&s;&s;ured me that out of 314 patients whom he vi&s;ited, and 187 for whom he pre&s;cribed from the reports of their friends, he lo&s;t only 47 (which is nearly but one in eleven) and that he treated them all agreeably to the method which I had recom|mended. The Rev. Mr Schmidt one of the mi|ni&s;ters of the Lutheran church, was cured by him. I have before mentioned an in&s;tance of the judg|ment of Mr Connelly, and of his zeal in vi&s;iting and pre&s;cribing for the &s;ick. His remedies were
<PB N="322" REF="027658_0329_0FD7CCA930C9EDE0">
bleeding and purging. He moreover, bore a con|&s;tant and u&s;eful te&s;timony again&s;t bark, wine, lau|danum, and the warm bath<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the letter before quoted, from Mr Connelly he ex|pre&s;&s;es his opinion of tho&s;e four medicines in the following words. "Laudanum, bark, and wine, have put a period to the exi&s;tence of &s;ome, where the fever has been appa|rently broken, and the patients in a fair way of recovery; a &s;ingle do&s;e of laudanum has hurried them &s;uddenly in|to eternity. I have vi&s;ited a few patients, where the hot bath was u&s;ed, and am convinced that it only tended to weaken, and relax the &s;y&s;tem, without producing any good effect."</NOTE>. Mrs Paxton in Carter's alley, and Mrs Evans the wife of Mr John Evans in Second-&s;treet, were indefatigable; the one in di&s;tributing mercurial purges compo&s;ed by her&s;elf, and the other in urging the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>copious</HI> bleeding and purging among her friends and neighbours, as the only &s;afe remedies for the fever. The&s;e worthy women were the means of &s;aving many lives<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The yellow fever prevailed at the Caraccos in South America in October 1793, with great mortality, more e&s;pe|cially among the Spani&s;h troops.

time, in which they were not employed in burying the dead, in vi&s;iting the poor who were &s;ick, and in bleeding and purging them, agreeably to the directions which had been printed in all the news papers. Their &s;ucce&s;s was unparalleled by what is called regular practice. This encomium upon the practice of the blacks, will not &s;urpri&s;e the reader when I add, that they had no fear of putrefaction in the fluids, nor of the calumnies of a body of fellow citizens in the republic of medi|cine, to deter them from plentiful purging and bleeding. They had be&s;ides no more patients, than they were able to vi&s;it two or three times a day. But great as their &s;ucce&s;s was, it was exceeded by tho&s;e per&s;ons who in de&s;pair of pro|curing medical aid of any kind, purged and bled them&s;elves. This palm of &s;uperior &s;ucce&s;s, will not be withheld from tho&s;e people, when I explain the cau&s;es of it. It was owing to their <HI>early</HI> u&s;e of the proper remedies, and to their being guided in the repetition of them, by the continuance of a ten&s;e pul&s;e, or of pain and fever. A day, an af|ternoon,
<PB N="324" REF="027658_0331_0FD7CCAC93DF1110">
and even an hour, were not lo&s;t by the&s;e people in waiting for the vi&s;it of a Phy&s;ician who was often detained from them, by &s;ickne&s;s, or by new and unexpected engagements, by which means the precious moment for u&s;ing the remedies, with effect, pa&s;&s;ed irrevocably away. I have &s;tated the&s;e facts from faithful inquiries, and numerous ob&s;ervations. I could mention the names, and families of many per&s;ons who thus cured them|&s;elves. One per&s;on only &s;hall be mentioned, who has &s;hewn by her conduct what rea&s;on is capable of doing when it is forced to act for it&s;elf. Mrs Long, a widow, after having been twice un&s;uc|ce&s;sful in her attempts to procure a phy&s;ician, un|dertook at la&s;t to cure her&s;elf. She took &s;everal of the mercurial purges, agreeably to the printed directions, and had her&s;elf bled <HI>&s;even</HI> times in the cour&s;e of five or &s;ix days. The indication for re|peating the bleeding, was the continuance of the pain in her head. Her recovery was rapid, and complete. The hi&s;tory of it was communicated to me by her&s;elf, with great gratitude, in my own hou&s;e, during my &s;econd confinement with the fever. To the&s;e accounts of per&s;ons who cured them&s;elves in the city, I could add many others, of citizens who &s;ickened in the country, and who cured them&s;elves by plentiful bleeding and pur|ging, without the attendance of a phy&s;ician.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="027658_0332_0FD7CCB033721EC8">
From a &s;hort review of the&s;e facts, rea&s;on, and humanity awake from their long repo&s;e in medi|cine, and unite in proclaiming, that it is time to take the cure of pe&s;tilential fevers out of the hands of phy&s;icians, and to place it in the hands of the people. Let not the reader &s;tartle at this propo|&s;ition. I &s;hall give the following rea&s;ons for it.</P>
<P N="1">1. In con&s;equence of the&s;e pe&s;tilential fevers affecting a great number of people at one time, it has always been, and always will be impo&s;&s;ible, for them <HI>all</HI> to have the benefit of medical aid, more e&s;pecially as the proportion of phy&s;icians to the number of &s;ick, is generally dimini&s;hed upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, by de&s;ertion, &s;ickne&s;s and death.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;afety of committing to the people the cure of pe&s;tilential fevers, particularly the yel|low fever and the plague, is e&s;tabli&s;hed by the &s;implicity and uniformity of their proximate cau&s;e, and of their remedies. However diver&s;ified they may be in their &s;ymptoms, the &s;y&s;tem in both di&s;|ea&s;es is always under a &s;tate of indirect debility, and in all ca&s;es requires the ab&s;traction of &s;timu|lus in a greater or le&s;s degree, or in a &s;udden or gradual manner. There can never be any danger of the people injuring them&s;elves by mi&s;taking any other di&s;ea&s;e for a yellow fever, or a plague,
<PB N="326" REF="027658_0333_0FD7C8BCA65C01E0">
for no other febrile di&s;order can prevail with them. It was probably to prevent this mi&s;take, that the Benevolent Father of mankind, who has permitted no evil to exi&s;t which does not carry its antidote along with it, originally impo&s;ed that law upon all great and mortal epidemics.</P>
<P N="3">3. The hi&s;tory of the yellow fever in the We&s;t Indies, proves the advantage of tru&s;ting patients to their own judgment. Dr Lind has remarked, that a greater proportion of &s;ailors who had no phy&s;icians, recovered from that fever, than of tho&s;e who had the be&s;t medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The fre&s;h air of the deck of a &s;hip, a purge of &s;alt water, and the free u&s;e of cold water, probably triumphed here over the cordial juleps of phy|&s;icians.</P>
<P N="4">4. By committing the cure of this and other pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es to the people, all tho&s;e cir|cum&s;tances which prevented the univer&s;al &s;ucce&s;s of purging, and bleeding in our late epidemic, will have no operation. The fever will be mild in mo&s;t ca&s;es, for all will prepare them&s;elves to receive it by a vegetable diet, and by moderate evacuations. The remedies will be u&s;ed the <HI>mo|ment</HI> the di&s;ea&s;e is felt, or even &s;een, and the con|tagion generated by it, will be feeble and propa|gated
<PB N="327" REF="027658_0334_0FD7CCB21F7567E0">
only to a &s;mall di&s;tance from &s;uch patients. There will then be no di&s;putes among phy&s;icians about the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e to di&s;tract the pub|lic mind, for they will &s;eldom be con&s;ulted in it. None will &s;uffer from chronic debility induced by previous fatigue, in attending the &s;ick, nor from the want of nur&s;es, for few will be &s;o ill as to re|quire them, and there will be no "foreboding" fears of death or de&s;pair of recovery, to invite an attack of the di&s;ea&s;e, or to en&s;ure its mortality.</P>
<P>The &s;mall-pox was once as fatal as the yellow fever and the plague. At pre&s;ent, it yields as univer&s;ally to a vegetable diet, and evacuations, in the hands of apothecaries, the clergy, and even of the good women, as it does in the hands of Doctors of phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>They have narrow conceptions, not only of the divine goodne&s;s, but of the gradual progre&s;s of human knowledge, who &s;uppo&s;e that all pe&s;tilen|tial di&s;ea&s;es &s;hall not, like the &s;mall-pox, &s;ooner or later cea&s;e to be the &s;courge and terror of man|kind.</P>
<P>For a long while air, water and even the light of the &s;un, were dealt out by phy&s;icians to their pa|tients with a &s;paring hand. They po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed for &s;e|veral centuries the &s;ame monopoly of many artificial
<PB N="328" REF="027658_0335_0FD7CCB395E0E038">
remedies. But a new order of things is ri&s;ing in medicine as well as in government. Air, water, and light are taken without the advice of a phy&s;i|cian, and bark and laudanum are now pre&s;cribed every where by nur&s;es, and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of families, with &s;afety and advantage. Human rea&s;on cannot be &s;tationary upon the&s;e &s;ubjects. The time mu&s;t, and will come, when in addition to the above reme|dies, the general u&s;e of calomel, jalap, and the lancet, &s;hall be con&s;idered among the mo&s;t e&s;&s;en|tial articles of the knowledge, and rights of man.</P>
<P>It is no more nece&s;&s;ary, that a patient &s;hould be ignorant of the medicine he takes to be cured by it, than that the bu&s;ine&s;s of government &s;hould be conducted with &s;ecrecy in order to en&s;ure obedi|ence to ju&s;t laws. Much le&s;s is it nece&s;&s;ary that the means of life &s;hould be pre&s;cribed in a dead language, or dictated with the &s;olemn pomp of a necromancer. The effects of impo&s;ture in every thing are like the artificial health produced by the u&s;e of ardent &s;pirits. Its vigour is temporary, and is always followed by mi&s;ery and death.</P>
<P>The belief that the yellow fever and the plague are nece&s;&s;arily mortal, is as much the effect of a &s;uper&s;titious torpor in the under&s;tanding, as the ancient belief, that the epilep&s;y was a &s;upernatural di&s;ea&s;e, and that it was an offence again&s;t heaven
<PB N="329" REF="027658_0336_0FD7C8BEAD6A5F90">
to attempt to cure it. It is partly from the influ|ence of this torpor in the minds of &s;ome people, that the numerous cures of the yellow fever per|formed by a few &s;imple remedies, were &s;aid to be of <HI>other</HI> di&s;ea&s;es. It is nece&s;&s;ary, for the con|viction of &s;uch per&s;ons, that patients &s;hould always <HI>die</HI> of that, and other dangerous di&s;orders, to prove that they have been affected by them.</P>
<P>The repairs which our world is undergoing, as far as they relate to the melioration of the condi|tion of man, will be incomplete, until pe&s;tilential fevers cea&s;e to be numbered among the wide&s;t outlets of human life.</P>
<P>There are many things which are now familiar to women and children which were known a cen|tury ago only to a few men who lived in clo&s;ets, and were di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of philo&s;o|phers.</P>
<P>We teach an hundred things in our &s;chools le&s;s u&s;eful, and many things more difficult, than the knowledge that would be nece&s;&s;ary to cure a yel|low fever or the plague.</P>
<P>In my attempts to teach the citizens of Phila|delphia by my different publications, the method
<PB N="330" REF="027658_0337_0FD7C8C3A7CE0C58">
of curing them&s;elves of our late fever, I ob&s;erved no difficulty in their apprehending every thing that was addre&s;&s;ed to them, except what related to the different &s;tates of the pul&s;e. All the know|ledge that is nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;cover when blood-letting is proper, might be taught to a boy or girl of twelve years old in a few hours. I taught it in le&s;s time to &s;everal per&s;ons during the pre|valence of our late epidemic.</P>
<P>I &s;hould as &s;oon believe that ratafia was intend|ed by the Author of Nature, to be the only drink of man, in&s;tead of water, as believe that the knowledge of what relates to the health and lives of a <HI>whole</HI> city, or nation, &s;hould be con|fined to one, and that a &s;mall or a privileged order of men.&mdash;But what have phy&s;icians, what have univer&s;ities, or medical &s;ocieties done after the labours, and &s;tudies of many centuries towards le&s;&s;ening the mortality of pe&s;tilential fevers? They have either copied, or contradicted each other in all their publications. Plagues and ma|lignant fevers, are &s;till leagued with war and fa|mine, in their ravages upon human life.</P>
<P>Botallus in France, and Dr Sydenham in Eng|land, it is true, long ago u&s;ed the proper remedies for tho&s;e di&s;orders with univer&s;al &s;ucce&s;s; but
<PB N="331" REF="027658_0338_0FD7CCB541B3E9C0">
they were unable to introduce them into general practice. The rea&s;on is obvious: They recom|mended them in their writings only to phy&s;icians. At the expence of an immen&s;e load of obloquy, I have addre&s;&s;ed my publications to the people. The appeal though hazardous, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of general knowledge in medicine, has &s;uc|ceeded. The citizens of Philadelphia are deliver|ed from their fears of copious evacuations, of cold air, and cold water, and above all, of a &s;ore mouth from mercury, in the cure of the yellow fever; and the pride and formalities of medicine, as far as they relate to this di&s;ea&s;e, are now as completely di&s;carded in our city, as the deceptions of witchcraft were, above a century ago.</P>
<P>To prevent the propagation and mortality of this fever, it will be nece&s;&s;ary when it makes its appearance in a city or country, to publi&s;h an ac|count of tho&s;e &s;ymptoms which I have called the <HI>precur&s;ors</HI> of the di&s;ea&s;e, and to exhort the peo|ple as &s;oon they feel tho&s;e &s;ymptoms, to have immediate recour&s;e to the remedies of purging or bleeding. The danger of delay in u&s;ing one, or both tho&s;e remedies, &s;hould be inculcated in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, for the di&s;ea&s;e, like Time, has a lock on its forehead, but is bald behind. The bite of a rattle-&s;nake is &s;eldom fatal, becau&s;e the
<PB N="332" REF="027658_0339_0FD7CCB7527B75E8">
medicines which cure it, are applied, or taken, as &s;oon as the poi&s;on comes in contact with the blood. There is le&s;s danger to be apprehended from the contagion of the yellow fever in the &s;y&s;tem than from the poi&s;on of the &s;nake, provided the reme|dies for it, are admini&s;tered within a few hours after it is excited into action.</P>
<P>Let per&s;ons who are &s;ubject to chronic pains, or di&s;ea&s;es of any kind, be advi&s;ed not to be deceiv|ed by them. Every pain at &s;uch a time, is the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e; for the contagion I have &s;aid, always acts fir&s;t on debilitated parts of the body. From an ignorance of this law of epide|mics many per&s;ons by delaying their applications for help, peri&s;hed with our late fever.</P>
<P>Let nature be tru&s;ted in no ca&s;e whatever, to cure this di&s;ea&s;e; and let no attack of it, however light, be treated with neglect. Death as cer|tainly performs his work, when he &s;teals on the &s;y&s;tem in the form of a mild intermittent, as he does, when he comes on with the &s;ymptoms of apoplexy, or a black vomiting.</P>
<P>Cleanline&s;s in hou&s;es and dre&s;s, cannot be too often inculcated during the prevalence of a yellow fever.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="027658_0340_0FD7CCB812C9A1A0">
La&s;tly, Let tho&s;e who are in health be directed to prepare their bodies by means of a low diet, for the reception of the di&s;ea&s;e in the manner that has been formerly mentioned; and let plea&s;ure, and even labour, where it expo&s;es men to the heat of the &s;un, or of a culinary fire, be every where &s;u&s;|pended. Thus, while the &s;y&s;tem is prepared to bend like the willow, the contagion of the fever will pa&s;s over it, without doing any harm.</P>
<P>Let it not be &s;uppo&s;ed, that I mean, that the hi&s;tory which I have given of the method of cure of our late epidemic, &s;hould be applied in all its parts, to the yellow fevers which may appear hereafter in the United States, or which exi&s;t at all times in the We&s;t India i&s;lands. Sea&s;on and climate vary this, as well as all other di&s;ea&s;es. Bark and wine, &s;o fatal in our late, may be pro|per in a future yellow fever. But without the fear of being refuted, I will notwith&s;tanding a&s;&s;ert, that the proper remedies for this fever at all times, and in all places in its <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;tage, <HI>mu&s;t be</HI> evacuations. The only inquiry, when the di&s;ea&s;e makes its appearance, &s;hould be, from what part of the body the&s;e evacuations &s;hould be procured; the order which &s;hould be pur&s;ued in obtaining them, and the quantity of each of the matters to
<PB N="334" REF="027658_0341_0FD7CCBCF08C0638">
be di&s;charged, which &s;hould be withdrawn at a time.</P>
<P>Thus far did I venture from my theory of the di&s;ea&s;e, and from the authorities of Dr Hillary and and Dr Mo&s;ely, to decide in favour of evacua|tions in the yellow fever in hot climates; but Dr Wade, and Mr Chi&s;holm again &s;upport me by their practice in the fevers of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies. They both gave &s;trong mercurial pur|ges, and bled in &s;ome ca&s;es. Dr Wade confirm|ed by his practice, the advantage, of <HI>gradually</HI> ab&s;tracting &s;timulus from the &s;y&s;tem. He never drew blood even in the mo&s;t inflammatory ca&s;es, until he had fir&s;t di&s;charged the contents of the bowels. The Doctor has further e&s;tabli&s;hed the efficacy of a vegetable diet, and of water as a drink, as the be&s;t means of preventing the di&s;or|der in a hot climate.</P>
<P>The manner in which the contagion of the plague acts upon the &s;y&s;tem, is &s;o much like that which has been de&s;cribed in the yellow fever, and the accounts of the efficacy of low diet in pre|paring the body for its reception, and of copious bleeding, cold air and cold water, in curing it, are &s;o &s;imilar, that all the directions which relate
<PB N="335" REF="027658_0342_0FD7CCF7D83E19B8">
to preventing, mitigating, or curing the yellow fever, may be applied to it. The fluids in the plague &s;hew a greater tendency to the &s;kin, than they do, in the yellow fever. Perhaps upon this account, the early u&s;e of powerful &s;udorifics may be more proper in the former, than in the latter di&s;order. From the influ|ence of early purging, and bleeding in pro|moting &s;weat in the yellow fever; there can be little doubt, but the efforts of nature to unload the &s;y&s;tem in the plague through the channel of the pores, might be accelerated by the early u&s;e of the &s;ame remedies. One thing with re&s;pect to the plague is certain; that its cure depends upon the ab&s;traction of &s;timulus, either by means of plentiful &s;weats, or of purulent matter from ex|ternal &s;ores. Perhaps the efficacy of the&s;e re|medies depends wholly upon their dimini&s;hing the indirect debility of the &s;y&s;tem in a <HI>gradual</HI> manner. If this be the ca&s;e, tho&s;e natural di&s;|charges might be ea&s;ily and effectually imitated by &s;mall and repeated bleedings.</P>
<P>To corre&s;pond in quantity with the di&s;charge from the &s;kin, blood-letting in the plague &s;hould be copious. A profu&s;e &s;weat continued for twen|ty four hours, cannot fail of wa&s;ting many pounds of the fluids of the body. This was the duration

of the critical &s;weats in the famous plague which was known by the name of the Engli&s;h &s;weating &s;ickne&s;s, and which made its appearance in the army of Henry VII. in Milford-Haven in Wales, and &s;pread from thence through every part of the kingdom.</P>
<P>The principles which lead to the prevention and cure of the yellow fever and the plague, apply with equal force to the mitigation of the mea&s;les, and to the prevention or mitigation of the &s;carlatina angino&s;a, the dy&s;entery, and the jail or ho&s;pital fe|ver. I have remarked in a former publication<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Medical Inquiries and Ob&s;ervations, vol. ii. page 244.</NOTE>, that a previous vegetable diet le&s;&s;ened the violence and danger of the mea&s;les. Dr Sims taught me &s;eve|ral years ago, to prevent or mitigate the &s;carlatina angino&s;a, by means of gentle purges after children are infected by it<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Medical Memoirs, vol. i.</NOTE>. Purges of &s;alts have in many in&s;tances pre&s;erved whole families and neighbour|hoods from the dy&s;entery where they have been expo&s;ed to the contagion.

effects of previous evacuations in abating the vio|lence, or preventing the mortality of the malig|nant &s;ore throat, but I can have no doubt of their efficacy from the &s;amene&s;s of the &s;tate of the &s;y&s;|tem in that di&s;order, as in other malignant fevers. The debility induced in it, is of the indirect kind, and the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ymptoms of putrefaction, are nothing but the di&s;gui&s;ed effects of a &s;udden and violent pre&s;&s;ure of an inflammatory &s;timulus upon the arterial &s;y&s;tem.</P>

My principal aim has been to revive, and apply to it, the principles, and practice of Dr. Sydenham, and however coldly tho&s;e principles, and that practice may be received by &s;ome phy&s;icians of the pre&s;ent day, I am &s;ati&s;|fied that experience in all ages, and in all coun|tries will vouch for their truth and utility.</P>

<P>NARRATIVES of e&s;capes from great dangers of &s;hipwreck, war, captivity, and famine, have always formed an intere&s;ting part of the hi&s;tory of the body, and mind of man. But there are deliverances from equal dangers, which have hitherto pa&s;&s;ed unnoticed; I mean, from pe&s;tilential fevers. I &s;hall briefly de&s;cribe the &s;tate of my body and mind, during my intercour&s;e with the &s;ick in our late epidemic. The account will throw additional light upon the di&s;order, and pro|bably illu&s;trate &s;ome of the laws of the animal economy. It will moreover &s;erve to furni&s;h a le&s;&s;on to all who may be placed in &s;imilar circum|&s;tances, to commit their lives without fear, to the protection of that BEING who is able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t, not only from future, but from pre|&s;ent evil.</P>
<P>Some time before the fever made its appearance, my wife and children went into the &s;tate of New-Jer&s;ey where they had long been in the habit of &s;pending the &s;ummer months. My family about
<PB N="340" REF="027658_0346_0FD7C8CC03EA0F58">
the 25th of Augu&s;t, con&s;i&s;ted of my mother, a &s;i&s;|ter who was on a vi&s;it to me, a black &s;ervant man, and a mulatto boy. I had five pupils, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Warner Wa&s;hington, and Edward Fi&s;her, of Virginia, John Al&s;ton of South Carolina, and John Red|man Coxe (grand&s;on to Dr Redman) and John Stall both of this city. They all crouded around me upon the &s;udden encrea&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s, and with one heart devoted them&s;elves to my &s;ervice, and to the cau&s;e of humanity.</P>
<P>The credit which the new mode of treating the di&s;ea&s;e acquired in all parts of the city, produced an immen&s;e influx of patients to me from all quar|ters. My pupils were con&s;tantly employed; at fir&s;t in putting up purging powders, but after a while <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> in bleeding and vi&s;iting the &s;ick.</P>
<P>Between the eighth and the 15th of September I vi&s;ited and pre&s;cribed for, between an hundred and an hundred and twenty patients a day. Several of my pupils vi&s;ited a fourth or fifth part of that number. For a while we refu&s;ed no calls. In the &s;hort intervals of bu&s;ine&s;s which I &s;pent at my meals, my hou&s;e was filled with patients, chiefly the poor, waiting for advice. For many weeks I &s;eldom ate without pre&s;cribing for numbers as I &s;at at my table. To a&s;&s;i&s;t me at the&s;e hours, as
<PB N="341" REF="027658_0347_0FD7CD02A357E5B8">
well as in the night, Mr Stall, Mr Fi&s;her and Mr Coxe accepted of rooms in my hou&s;e, and became members of my family. Their labours now had no remi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Immediately after I adopted the antiphlogi&s;tic mode of treating the di&s;order, I altered my man|ner of living. I left off drinking wine and malt liquors. The good effects of the di&s;u&s;e of the&s;e liquors, helped to confirm me in the theory I had adopted of the di&s;ea&s;e. A trouble&s;ome head-ach, which I had occa&s;ionally felt, and which excited a con&s;tant apprehen&s;ion that I was taking the fe|ver, now &s;uddenly left me. I likewi&s;e at this time left off eating &s;olid animal food, and lived wholly, but &s;paringly, upon weak broth, pota|toes, rai&s;ins, coffee, and bread and butter.</P>
<P>From my great intercour&s;e with the &s;ick, my body became highly impregnated with the conta|gion. My eyes were yellow, and &s;ometimes a yellowne&s;s was perceptible in my face. My pul&s;e was preternaturally quick, and I had profu&s;e &s;weats every night. The&s;e &s;weats were &s;o offen|&s;ive as to oblige me to draw the bed-cloths clo&s;e to my neck to defend my&s;elf from their &s;mell. They lo&s;t their foetor entirely upon my leaving
<PB N="342" REF="027658_0348_0FD7CD03D2E84948">
off the u&s;e of broth, and living intirely upon milk and vegetables. But my nights were ren|dered di&s;agreeable, not only by the&s;e &s;weats, but by the want of my u&s;ual &s;leep, produced in part by the frequent knocking at my door, and in part by anxiety of mind, and the &s;timulus of the con|tagion upon my &s;y&s;tem. I lay down in conformi|ty to habit only, for my bed cea&s;ed to afford me re&s;t or refre&s;hment. When it was evening, I wi&s;hed for morning; and when it was morning, the pro&s;pect of the labours of the day, cau&s;ed me to wi&s;h for the return of evening. The degrees of my anxiety may be ea&s;ily conceived, when I add, that I had at one time upwards of thirty heads of families under my care: among the&s;e were Mr Jo&s;iah Coates, the father of eight, and Mr Benjamin Scull, and Mr John Morrell, each fathers of ten children. They were all in immi|nent danger; but it plea&s;ed God to make me the in&s;trument of &s;aving each of their lives. I ro&s;e at 6 o'clock, and generally found a number of per&s;ons waiting for advice in my &s;hop or parlour. Hitherto the &s;ucce&s;s of my practice gave a tone to my mind, which imparted preternatural vigour to my body. It was meat and drink to me to ful|fil the duties I owed to my fellow citizens in this time of great and univer&s;al di&s;tre&s;s. From a hope
<PB N="343" REF="027658_0349_0FD7CD05DC93CFA8">
that I might e&s;cape the di&s;ea&s;e, by avoiding every thing that could excite the contagion in my body into action, I carefully avoided the heat of the &s;un, and the coldne&s;s of the evening air. I like|wi&s;e avoided yielding to every thing that &s;hould rai&s;e or depre&s;s my pa&s;&s;ions. But at &s;uch a time, the events which influence the &s;tate of the body and mind are no more under our command, than the winds or weather. On the evening of the 14th of September, after eight o'clock, I vi&s;ited the &s;on of Mrs Berriman, near the Swedes' church, who had &s;ent for me early in the morn|ing. I found him very ill. He had been bled in the forenoon by my advice, but his pul&s;e indicat|ed a &s;econd bleeding. It would have been diffi|cult to procure a bleeder at that late hour. I therefore bled him my&s;elf. From hanging over his breath and blood for ten minutes, and after|wards riding home in the night air, debilitated as I was by the labours of the day, I found my&s;elf much indi&s;po&s;ed the en&s;uing night. I ro&s;e not|with&s;tanding at my u&s;ual hour. At 8 o'clock I lo&s;t ten ounces of blood, and immediately after|wards got into my chair, and vi&s;ited between for|ty and fifty patients before dinner. At the hou&s;e of one of them, I was forced to lie down a few minutes. In the cour&s;e of this morning's labours, my mind was &s;uddenly thrown off its pivots, by
<PB N="344" REF="027658_0350_0FD7CD084F8C29E0">
the la&s;t look, and the pathetic cries of a friend for <HI>help,</HI> who was dying under the care of a French phy&s;ician. I came home about two o'clock, and was &s;eized immediately afterwards with a chilly fit and a high fever. I took a do&s;e of the mercurial medicine, and went to bed. In the evening I took a &s;econd purging powder, and lo&s;t ten ounces more of blood. The next morning I bathed my face, hands, and feet in cold water for &s;ome time. I drank plentifully during the day and night of weak hy&s;on tea, and of water, in which currant jelly had been di&s;&s;olved. At eight o'clock I was &s;o well as to admit per&s;ons who came for ad|vice into my room, and to receive reports from my pupils of the &s;tate of as many of my patients as they were able to vi&s;it; for unfortunately they were not able to vi&s;it them all (with their own) in due time; by which means &s;everal died. The next day I came down &s;tairs, and pre&s;cribed in my parlour for not le&s;s than an hundred people. On the 19th of the &s;ame month, I re&s;umed my la|bours, but in great weakne&s;s. It was with diffi|culty that I a&s;cended a pair of &s;tairs, by the help of a bani&s;ter. A &s;low fever, attended with irre|gular chills, and a trouble&s;ome cough, hung con|&s;tantly upon me. The fever di&s;covered it&s;elf in the heat of my hands, which my patients often told me were warmer than their own. The con|tagion
<PB N="345" REF="027658_0351_0FD7CD0BE5E03678">
now began to affect me in &s;mall and infect|ed rooms, in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible manner. On the morning of the 4th of October I &s;uddenly &s;unk down in a &s;ick room upon a bed, with a giddine&s;s in my head. It continued for a few minutes, and was &s;ucceeded by a fever which confined me to my hou&s;e the remaining part of the day.</P>
<P>Every moment in the intervals of my vi&s;its to the &s;ick, was employed in pre&s;cribing in my own hou&s;e for the poor, or in &s;ending an&s;wers to me&s;|&s;ages from my patients; time was now too pre|cious to be &s;pent in counting the number of per|&s;ons who called upon me for advice. From cir|cum&s;tances, I believe it was frequently 150, and &s;eldom le&s;s than 50 in a day, for five or &s;ix weeks. The evening did not bring with it the lea&s;t relax|ation from my labours. I received letters every day from the country, and from di&s;tant parts of the Union, containing inquiries into the mode of treating the di&s;order, and after the health and lives of per&s;ons who had remained in the city. The bu&s;ine&s;s of every evening was to an&s;wer the&s;e letters, al&s;o to write to my family. The&s;e em|ployments by affording a fre&s;h current to my thoughts, kept me from dwelling on the gloomy &s;cenes of the day. After the&s;e duties were per|formed, I copied into my note book all the ob&s;er|vations
<PB N="346" REF="027658_0352_0FD7CD0EA5151E48">
I had collected during the day, and which I had marked with a pencil in my pocket book in &s;ick rooms, or in my carriage. To the&s;e con&s;tant labours of body and mind were added di&s;tre&s;&s;es, from a variety of cau&s;es. Having found my&s;elf unable to comply with the numerous applications that were made to me, I was obliged to refu&s;e many, every day. My &s;i&s;ter counted forty &s;even in one forenoon before 11 o'clock. Many of them left my door with tears, but they did not feel more di&s;tre&s;s than I did, from refu&s;ing to fol|low them. Sympathy when it vents it&s;elf in acts of humanity, affords plea&s;ure, and contributes to health, but the reflux of pity, like anger, gives pain, and di&s;orders the body. In riding through the &s;treets, I was often forced to re&s;i&s;t the entreaties of parents imploring a vi&s;it to their children, or of children to their parents. I recollect, and even yet, I recollect with pain, that I tore my&s;elf at one time from five per&s;ons in Moravian-alley who at|tempted to &s;top me; by &s;uddenly whipping my hor&s;e, and driving my chair as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible beyond the reach of their cries.</P>
<P>The &s;olicitude of the friends of the &s;ick for help, may further be conceived of, when I add, that the mo&s;t extravagant compen&s;ations were &s;ometimes offered for medical &s;ervices, and in one
<PB N="347" REF="027658_0353_0FD7CD105AF2A2C8">
in&s;tance, for only a &s;ingle vi&s;it. I had no merit in refu&s;ing the&s;e offers, and I have introduced an ac|count of them, only to inform &s;uch phy&s;icians as may hereafter be thrown into a &s;imilar &s;ituation, that I was favoured with an exemption from the fear of death, in proportion as I &s;ubdued every &s;elfi&s;h feeling, and laboured exclu&s;ively for the be|nefit of others. In every in&s;tance in which I was forced to refu&s;e the&s;e pathetic and earne&s;t appli|cations, my di&s;tre&s;s was heightened by the fear, that the per&s;ons whom I was unable to vi&s;it, would fall into improper hands, and peri&s;h by the u&s;e of bark, wine, and laudanum.</P>
<P>But I had other afflictions be&s;ides the di&s;tre&s;s which aro&s;e from the abortive &s;ympathy which I have de&s;cribed. On the 11th of September, my ingenious pupil Mr Wa&s;hington, fell a victim to his humanity. He had taken lodgings in the coun|try, where he &s;ickened with the di&s;order. Having been almo&s;t uniformly &s;ucce&s;sful in curing others, he made light of his fever, and concealed the knowledge of his danger from me, until the day before he died. On the 18th of September Mr Stall &s;ickened in my hou&s;e. A delirium attended his fever from the fir&s;t hour it affected him. He refu&s;ed, and even re&s;i&s;ted force when u&s;ed to com|pel him to take medicine. He died on the 23d

</LETTER></NOTE>. Scarcely had I recovered from the &s;hock of the death of this amiable youth, when I was called to weep for a third pupil, Mr Al&s;ton, who died in my neighbourhood, the next day. He had worn him&s;elf down before his &s;ickne&s;s, by uncom|mon exertions in vi&s;iting, bleeding, and even &s;it|ting up with &s;ick people. At this time Mr Fi&s;her was ill in my hou&s;e. On the 26th of the month at 12 o'clock Mr Coxe my only a&s;&s;i&s;tant was &s;eized with the fever, and went to his grand father's.
<PB N="349" REF="027658_0355_0FD7CD172C5F6BB8">
I followed him with a look, which I feared would be the la&s;t, in my hou&s;e. At two o'clock my &s;i&s;ter who had complained for &s;everal days, yielded to the di&s;order, and retired to her bed. My mother followed her, much indi&s;po&s;ed, early in the evening. My black &s;ervant man had been confined with the fever for &s;everal days, and had on that day for the fir&s;t time quitted his bed. My little mulatto boy of eleven years old, was the only per&s;on in my fa|mily who was able to afford me the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance. At 8 o'clock in the evening, I fini&s;hed the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day. A &s;olemn &s;tillne&s;s at that time per|vaded the &s;treets. In vain did I &s;trive to forget my melancholy &s;ituation by an&s;wering letters, and by putting up medicines to be di&s;tributed next day among my patients. My faithful black man crept to my door, and at my reque&s;t &s;at down by the fire, but he added by his &s;ilence and dullne&s;s, to the gloom which &s;uddenly overpowered every faculty of my mind.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t day of October at two o'clock in the afternoon, my &s;i&s;ter died. I got into my carriage within an hour after &s;he expired, and &s;pent the af|ternoon in vi&s;iting patients. According as a &s;en&s;e of duty, or as grief has predominated in my mind, I have approved, and di&s;approved of this act, ever &s;ince. She had borne a &s;hare in my labours. She
<PB N="350" REF="027658_0356_0FD7CD18D4E08738">
had been my nur&s;e in &s;ickne&s;s, and my ca&s;ui&s;t in my choice of duties. My whole heart repo&s;ed it&s;elf in her friend&s;hip. Upon being invited to a friend's hou&s;e in the country, when the di&s;ea&s;e made its appearance in the city, &s;he declined ac|cepting the invitation, and gave as a rea&s;on for &s;o doing, that I might probably require her &s;er|vices in ca&s;e of my taking the di&s;order, and that if &s;he were &s;ure of dying, &s;he would remain with me, provided that by her death, &s;he could &s;ave my life. From this time I declined in health and &s;trength. All motion became painful to me. My appetite began to fail. My night &s;weats conti|nued. My &s;hort and imperfect &s;leep, was di&s;turbed by di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, or frightful dreams. The &s;cenes of them were derived altogether from &s;ick rooms, and grave yards. I concealed my &s;orrows as much as po&s;&s;ible from my patients, but when alone, the retro&s;pect of what was pa&s;t, and the pro&s;pect of what was before me, the termination of which was invi&s;ible, often filled my &s;oul with the mo&s;t poignant angui&s;h. I wept frequently when retired from the public eye, but I did not weep over the lo&s;t members of my family alone. I be|held or heard every day of the deaths of citizens u&s;eful in public, or amiable in private life. It was my misfortune to lo&s;e as patients, the Rev. Mr Fleming and Mr Grae&s;el, both exhau&s;ted by their
<PB N="351" REF="027658_0357_0FD7C8CD262240B8">
labours of piety and love among the poor, before they &s;ickened with the di&s;order. I &s;aw the la&s;t &s;truggles of departing life in Mr Powel, and de|plored in his death, an upright and faithful &s;ervant of the public, as well as a &s;incere and affectionate friend. Often did I mourn over per&s;ons who had by the mo&s;t unparalleled exertions, &s;aved their friends and families from the grave, at the expence of their own lives. Many of the&s;e martyrs to humanity, were in humble &s;tations. Among the members of my profe&s;&s;ion with whom I had been mo&s;t intimately connected, I had daily cau&s;e of grief and di&s;tre&s;s. I &s;aw the great and expanded mind of Dr Penington, &s;hattered by delirium, ju&s;t before he died. He was to me dear and beloved, like a younger brother. He was moreover a Joab in the conte&s;t with the di&s;ea&s;e. Philadelphia mu&s;t long deplore the premature death of this ex|cellent phy&s;ician. Had he lived a few years lon|ger, he would have filled an immen&s;e &s;pace in the republic of medicine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Before he fini&s;hed his &s;tudies in medicine, he publi&s;hed a volume of ingenious and patriotic "Chemical and OEco|nomical E&s;&s;ays, de&s;igned to illu&s;trate the connection between the theory, and practice of chemi&s;try, and the application of that &s;cience to &s;ome of the arts and manufactures of the United States of America."</NOTE>. It was my affliction to &s;ee my friend Dr John Morris breathe his la&s;t, and
<PB N="352" REF="027658_0358_0FD7CD1A52496968">
to hear the fir&s;t effu&s;ions of the mo&s;t pathetic grief from his mother, as &s;he bur&s;ted from the room in which he died. But I had di&s;tre&s;s from the &s;ick|ne&s;s, as well as the deaths of my brethren in phy&s;ic. My worthy friends Dr Griffitts. Dr Say, and Dr Mea&s;e, were &s;u&s;pended by a thread over the grave, nearly at the &s;ame time. Heaven in mercy to me, as well as in kindne&s;s to the public, and their friends, pre&s;erved their lives. Had they died, the mea&s;ure of my &s;orrows would have been com|plete.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid before, that I early left off drinking wine; but I u&s;ed it in another way. I carried a little wine in a vial in my pocket, and when I felt my&s;elf fainty, after coming out of a &s;ick room, or after a long ride, I kept about a &s;poonful of it in my mouth for half a minute, or longer, without &s;wallowing it. So weak and excitable was my &s;y&s;tem, that this &s;mall quantity of wine refre&s;hed and invigorated me as much as half a pint would have done at any other time. The only diffe|rence was, that the vigour I derived from the wine in the former, was of &s;horter duration than when taken in the latter way.</P>
<P>For the fir&s;t two weeks after I vi&s;ited patients in the yellow fever, I carried a rag wetted with
<PB N="353" REF="027658_0359_0FD7CD1FD8808988">
vinegar, and &s;melled it occa&s;ionally in &s;ick rooms: but after I &s;aw and felt the &s;igns of the univer&s;al pre&s;ence of the contagion in my &s;y&s;tem, I laid a&s;ide this, and all other precautions. I re&s;ted my|&s;elf on the bed-&s;ide of my patients, and I drank milk, or eat fruit in their &s;ick rooms. Be&s;ides be|ing &s;aturated with the contagion, I had another &s;ecurity again&s;t being infected by my patients, and that was, I went into &s;carcely a hou&s;e which was more infected than my own. Mo&s;t of the people who called upon me for advice, left a por|tion of contagion behind them. Four per&s;ons died next door to me on the ea&s;t; three a few doors above me on the we&s;t; and five in a &s;mall frame hou&s;e on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the &s;treet, to|wards the &s;outh. On the north &s;ide, and about 150 feet from my hou&s;e, the fever prevailed with great malignity in the family of Mr James Cre&s;|&s;on. But this was not all. Many of the poor people who called upon me for advice, were bled by my pupils in my &s;hop, and in the yard, which was between it, and the &s;treet. From the want of a &s;ufficient number of bowls to receive their blood, it was &s;ometimes &s;uffered to flow and pu|trify upon the ground. From all the&s;e &s;ources, &s;treams of contagion were con&s;tantly poured into my hou&s;e, and conveyed into my body by the air, and in my aliment. Thus charged with the fuel
<PB N="354" REF="027658_0360_0FD7C935DBC183B8">
of death, I was frequently di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ay with Job, and almo&s;t without a figure, to "corrup|tion, thou art my father; and to the worm, thou art my mother and my &s;i&s;ter."</P>
<P>The deaths of my pupils and &s;i&s;ter have often been urged as objections to my mode of treating the fever. Had the &s;ame degrees of labour and fatigue which preceded the attack of the yellow fever in each of them, preceded an attack of a common pleuri&s;y, I think it probable that &s;ome, or perhaps all of them, would have died with it. But when the influence of the concentrated con|tagion which filled my hou&s;e, was added to that of con&s;tant fatigue upon their bodies, what reme|dies could be expected to &s;ave their lives? Un|der the above circum&s;tances, I con&s;ider the reco|very of the other branches of my family from the fever (and none of them e&s;caped it) with emo|tions, &s;uch as I &s;hould feel, had we all been revived from apparent death, by the exertions of a hu|mane &s;ociety.</P>
<P>In getting ha&s;tily out of my carriage about the 22d of September, I wounded one of my fingers with a &s;mall nail. As my hands were con&s;tantly expo&s;ed to the contagion of the fever in feeling pul&s;es, I had this wound carefully wrapped up,
<PB N="355" REF="027658_0361_0FD7CD231CCC2D58">
from an apprehen&s;ion that the contagion when received directly into the blood, might more cer|tainly excite the fever, than when received in the ordinary way. In the hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s, the rag dropped off my finger without my noticing it. The wound inflamed, but healed notwith&s;tanding in a few days, and I found no inconvenience from it.</P>
<P>The i&s;&s;ue of this accident was highly &s;atisfacto|ry to me, as it e&s;tabli&s;hed the analogy between the &s;mall-pox and yellow fever, and confirmed me in the propriety of preparing the body for the re|ception of the latter, by the &s;ame regimen, as for the former di&s;order.</P>
<P>For upwards of &s;ix weeks I did not ta&s;te ani|mal food, nor fermented liquors of any kind. The quantity of aliment which I took inclu&s;ive of drinks, during this time, was frequently not more than one or two pounds in a day. Yet upon this diet, I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed for a while uncommon activity of body. This influence of ab&s;tinence upon bodily exertion, has been happily illu&s;trated by Dr Jack&s;on in his directions for pre&s;erving the the health of &s;oldiers in hot climates. He tells us, that he walked an hundred miles in three days in Jamaica, during which time he breakfa&s;ted on tea, &s;upped on bread and &s;allad, and drank nothing
<PB N="356" REF="027658_0362_0FD7CD247258DEC8">
but lemonade or water. He adds further, that he walked from Edinburgh to London in eleven days and an half, and that he travelled with the mo&s;t ea&s;e when he only breakfa&s;ted and &s;upped, and drank nothing but water. The fatigue of riding on hor&s;eback, is prevented or le&s;&s;ened by ab&s;tinence from &s;olid food. Even the hor&s;e &s;uffers lea&s;t from a quick and and long journey, when he is fed &s;paringly with hay. The&s;e facts add weight to the arguments formerly adduced, in favour of a vegetable diet in preventing or mitigating the action of the contagion of malig|nant fevers upon the &s;y&s;tem. In both ca&s;es the ab&s;traction of &s;timulus, removes the body fur|ther from the reach of indirect debility.</P>
<P>Food &s;upports life as much by its &s;timulus, as by affording nouri&s;hment to the body. Where an artificial &s;timulus acts upon the &s;y&s;tem, the natural &s;timulus of food cea&s;es to be nece&s;&s;ary. Under the influence of this principle, I encrea&s;ed, or dimini&s;hed my food with the &s;igns I di&s;cover|ed of the encrea&s;e, or diminution of the contagion in my body. Until the 15th of September I drank weak coffee, but after that time, I drank nothing but milk, or milk and water in the inter|vals of my meals. I was &s;o &s;atisfied of the efficacy of this mode of living, that I believed life
<PB N="357" REF="027658_0363_0FD7CC635460B0A8">
might have been pre&s;erved, and a fever prevented, for many days with a much greater accumulation of the contagion in my &s;y&s;tem, by means of a total ab&s;tinence from food. Poi&s;on is a relative term, and an exce&s;s in quantity, or a derangement in place, is nece&s;&s;ary to its producing deleterious effects. The contagion of the yellow fever pro|duced &s;ickne&s;s and death, only from the exce&s;s of its quantity, or from its force being encrea&s;ed by the addition of tho&s;e other &s;timuli which I have el&s;ewhere called exciting cau&s;es.</P>
<P>In addition to low diet, as a preventive of the di&s;order, I obviated co&s;tivene&s;s by taking occa|&s;ionally a calomel pill, or by chewing rhubarb.</P>
<P>I had read, and taught in my lectures, that fa&s;ting encrea&s;es acutene&s;s in the &s;en&s;e of touch. My low living had that effect in a certain degree upon my fingers. I had a quickne&s;s in my per|ception, of the &s;tate of the pul&s;e in the yellow fever, that I had never experienced before in any other di&s;order. My ab&s;temious diet, a&s;&s;i&s;ted perhaps by the &s;tate of my feelings, had like|wi&s;e an influence upon my mind. Its operations were performed with an ea&s;e, and a celerity, which rendered my numerous, and complicated duties, much le&s;s burden&s;ome, than they would
<PB N="358" REF="027658_0364_0FD7CD2A4D877870">
probably have been under other circum&s;tances of diet, or a le&s;s agitated &s;tate of my pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>My perception of the lap&s;e of time was new to me. It was uncommonly &s;low. The ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s and pur&s;uits of men appeared to me in a light that was equally new. The her&s;e and the grave mingled them&s;elves with every view I took of human affairs. Under the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions I re|collect being as much &s;truck with ob&s;erving a number of men employed in digging the of cellar a large hou&s;e, as I &s;hould have been at any other time, in &s;eeing preparations for building a palace upon a cake of ice. I recollect further, being &s;truck with &s;urpri&s;e about the 1&s;t of October, in &s;eeing a man bu&s;ily employed in laying in wood for the approaching winter. I &s;hould as &s;oon have thought of making provi&s;ion for a dinner on the fir&s;t day of the year 1800.</P>
<P>In the account of my di&s;tre&s;&s;es, I have pa&s;&s;ed over the &s;landers which were propagated again&s;t me by &s;ome of my brethren. I have mentioned them only for the &s;ake of declaring in this public manner, that I mo&s;t heartily forgive them; and that if I di&s;covered at any time, an undue &s;en&s;e of the unkindne&s;s and cruelty of tho&s;e &s;landers, it was not becau&s;e I felt my&s;elf injured by them, but
<PB N="359" REF="027658_0365_0FD7CD2C76503878">
becau&s;e I was &s;ure they would irreparably injure my fellow citizens, by le&s;&s;ening their confidence in the only remedies that I believed to be effectual in the reigning epidemic. One thing in my con|duct towards the&s;e gentlemen may require ju&s;tifi|cation; and that is, my refu&s;ing to con&s;ult with them. A Mahometan and a Jew might as well attempt to wor&s;hip the Supreme Being in the &s;ame temple, and through the medium of the &s;ame ceremonies, as two phy&s;icians of oppo&s;ite principles and practice, attempt to confer about the life of the &s;ame patient. What is done in cen&s;equence of &s;uch negotiations (for they are not con&s;ultations) is the ineffectual re&s;ult of neu|trali&s;ed opinions; and wherever they take place, would be con&s;idered as the effect of a criminal compact between phy&s;icians, to a&s;&s;e&s;s the property of their patients, by a &s;hameful pro&s;titution of the dictates of their con&s;ciences. Be&s;ides, I early di&s;|covered that it was impo&s;&s;ible for me by any rea|&s;onings, to change the practice of &s;ome of my bre|thren. Humanity was therefore on the &s;ide of leaving them to them&s;elves; for the extremity of <HI>wrong</HI> in medicine, as in morals and government, is often a le&s;s mi&s;chief, than that mixture of <HI>right</HI> and <HI>wrong</HI> which &s;erves by palliating, to perpetu|ate evil.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="027658_0366_0FD7CD3047772200">
After the lo&s;s of my health, I received letters from my friends in the country, pre<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">g me in the &s;tronge&s;t terms to leave the city. Such a &s;tep had become impracticable. My aged mother was too infirm to be removed, and I could not leave her. I was moreover, part of a little circle of phy&s;i|cians, who had a&s;&s;ociated them&s;elves in &s;upport of the new remedies. This circle would have been broken by my quitting the city. The weather varied the di&s;ea&s;e, and in the weake&s;t &s;tate of my body, I expected to be able from the reports of my pupils, to a&s;&s;i&s;t my a&s;&s;ociates in detecting its changes, and in accommodating our remedies to them. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, it plea&s;ed God to enable me to reply to one of the letters that urged my retreat from the city, that "I had re&s;olved to &s;tick to my principles, my practice, and my patients, to the la&s;t extremity."</P>
<P>On the ninth of October, I vi&s;ited a con&s;ider|able number of patients, and as the day was warm, I le&s;&s;ened the quantity of my clothing. Towards evening I was &s;eized with a pain in the back, which obliged me to go to bed at eight o'clock. About twelve I awoke with a chilly fit. A violent fever with acute pains in different parts of my bo|dy, followed it. At one o'clock I called for Mr Fi&s;her who &s;lept in the next room. He came in|&s;tantly,
<PB N="361" REF="027658_0367_0FD7CD319AAE23A0">
with my affectionate black man to my re|lief. I &s;aw my danger painted in Mr Fi&s;her's countenance. He bled me plentifully and gave me a do&s;e of the mercurial medicine. This was immediately rejected. He gave me a &s;econd do&s;e, which likewi&s;e acted as an emetic, and di&s;charged a large quantity of bile from my &s;tomach. The remaining part of the night was pa&s;&s;ed under an apprehen&s;ion that my labours were near an end. I could hardly expect to &s;urvive &s;o violent an at|tack of the fever, broken down, as I was, by labour, &s;ickne&s;s and grief. My wife and &s;even children, whom the great and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing events that were pa&s;&s;ing in our city, had jo&s;tled out of my mind for &s;ix or &s;even weeks, now re&s;umed their former place in my affections. My wife had &s;tipulated, in con&s;enting to remain in the country, to come to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance in ca&s;e of my &s;ickne&s;s; but I took mea&s;ures, which, without alarming her, proved effectual in preventing it. My hou&s;e was a Lazaretto, and the probability of my death, made her life doubly nece&s;&s;ary to my family. In the morning, the medicine operated kindly, and my fever abated. In the afternoon it returned, attended with a great inclination to &s;leep. Mr Fi&s;her bled me again which removed the &s;leepine&s;s. The next day the fever left me, but in &s;o weak a &s;tate, that I awoke two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive nights with a
<PB N="362" REF="027658_0368_0FD7CD337139DA38">
faintne&s;s which threatened the extinction of my life. It was removed each time by taking a little aliment. My convale&s;cence was extremely &s;low. I returned in a very gradual manner to my former habits of diet. The &s;mell of animal food, the fir&s;t time I &s;aw it at my table, forced me to leave the room. During the month of November, and all the winter months I was harra&s;&s;ed with a cough, and a fever &s;omewhat of the hectic kind. The early warmth of the &s;pring, removed tho&s;e complaints, and I now enjoy, through divine goodne&s;s, my u&s;ual &s;tate of health.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be deficient in gratitude, were I to con|clude this narrative without acknowledging my obligations to my &s;urviving pupils Mr Fi&s;her and Mr Coxe, for the great &s;upport and &s;ympathy I derived from them in my labours and di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>I take great plea&s;ure likewi&s;e in acknowledging my obligations to my former pupil Dr Woodhou&s;e, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in the care of my patients, after I became &s;o weak as not to be able to attend them with the punctuality their ca&s;es required. The di&s;intere&s;ted exploits of the&s;e young gentlemen in the cau&s;e of humanity, and their &s;ucce&s;s in the treatment of the di&s;order, have endeared their names to hundreds, and at the &s;ame time, afforded

a prelude of their future eminence and u&s;efulne&s;s in their profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
