<P>The committee appointed on the intere&s;ting concern for pro|moting the welfare of the Indian Natives&mdash;Report, that at &s;e|veral meetings in which we have had the company of divers concerned brethren not particularly named to the &s;ervice; we have deliberately con&s;idered this important &s;ubject, which hath for a &s;eries of years deeply exerci&s;ed the minds of many friends, and been latterly revived in the yearly meeting with increa&s;ing weight&mdash;Our minds have been mea&s;urably drawn into &s;ympathy with the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ed inhabitants of the wilderne&s;s, and on comparing their &s;ituation with our own, and calling to grateful remembrance the kindne&s;s of their predece&s;&s;ors to ours in the early &s;ettlement of this country; con&s;idering al&s;o our profe&s;&s;ed principles of peace and goodwill to men, we were in-induced with much unanimity to believe, that there are loud calls for our benevolence and charitable exertions to promote among&s;t them the principles of the Chri&s;tian religion, as well as to turn their attention to &s;chool learning, agriculture, and u&s;eful me|chanic employments, e&s;pecially as there appears in &s;ome of the tribes, a willingne&s;s to unite in the exerci&s;e of endeavours of this kind&mdash;We believe that this end may be much promoted under the Divine Ble&s;&s;ing, by a recommendation from this meeting to the &s;everal quarterly meetings, that a liberal &s;ub&s;cription be &s;et on foot and a fund rai&s;ed, to be under the direction of a &s;pecial committee to be appointed by the yearly meeting, in order that the&s;e pious purpo&s;es may be carried into effect as ear|ly as practicable, and the apparent friendly di&s;po&s;ition of go|vernment towards this de&s;irable object improved.&mdash;And con|ceiving that this &s;ubject is of &s;ufficient magnitude to claim the at|tention of our religious &s;ociety in different parts of this conti|nent, we think it may be u&s;eful to hint the &s;ub&s;tance of this concern in the Epi&s;tles to the re&s;pective yearly meetings.</P>

<HEAD>At a meeting of the &s;aid Committee in Philadelphia, on the <HI>3</HI>rd of the <HI>11</HI>th Month <HI>1795,</HI> the fol|lowing Epi&s;tle was directed to the Quarterly and Monthly Meetings belonging to the &s;aid Yearly Meeting.</HEAD>
<P>The committee appointed by the yearly meeting to attend to the growing concern for the welfare of our Indian Brethren, have &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered the important tru&s;t devolved upon them, the pro&s;ecution of which will evidently require prudence, patience and per&s;everance, its ultimate object, under the Di|vine Ble&s;&s;ing being no le&s;s than the temporal and &s;piritual welfare of &s;ome thou&s;ands of our fellow men, and their po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Difficulties however &s;hould not di&s;courage us from the exerci&s;e of our chri&s;tian duty toward the&s;e people, when we call to mind that they were the original inhabitants of this land, and that they kindly received and made room for our forefathers, when <HI>they</HI> were &s;trangers in it; e&s;pecially as <HI>we</HI> are &s;ettled upon the &s;ea coa&s;ts, and parts adjacent, enjoying, through the bounty of Providence, an abundance of temporal ble&s;&s;ings, where <HI>they</HI> once lived in ea&s;e and plenty, but are <HI>now</HI> wandering from hill to hill, &s;carcely able to find &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in their former way of life&mdash;Circum&s;tances which loudly call for our brotherly a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance&punc; to put them in a way to &s;upport them&s;elves by Agricul|ture and handicrafts.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="028715_0005_0FD9BCA81063E470">It is hoped that &s;ome &s;ober well qualified friends will be drawn to unite with the Concern &s;o far as to go among them for the pur|po&s;e of in&s;tructing them in hu&s;bandry, and u&s;eful trades; and teaching their children nece&s;&s;ary learning, that they may be ac|quainted with the Scriptures of truth, improve in the principles of Chri&s;tianity, and become qualified to manage temporal concerns&mdash; and it is expected that the committee will find it expedient to erect Gri&s;t and Saw Mills, Smith's &s;hops and other nece&s;&s;ary im|provements in &s;ome of their villages. For the &s;upport of tho&s;e who may be di&s;po&s;ed to undertake the performance of the&s;e &s;ervices, due provi&s;ion is intended to be made; and any propo&s;als from concerned friends will be received by Thomas Wi&s;tar of Phila|delphia our clerk, and laid before the committee for con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent appears to us a favourable period for carrying on this good work&mdash;the boundaries of &s;ome of the tribes are fixed by treaty&mdash;their lands cannot now be &s;o ea&s;ily alienated as hereto|fore, and evil communication with traders and others is intended to be prevented by Government, who&s;e con&s;ent and approbation of the mea&s;ures propo&s;ed has been already expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>We have appointed John Elliott our trea&s;urer, who is to re|ceive the collections that may be made in the &s;everal monthly meetings for the&s;e benevolent purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>To &s;pread before friends &s;ome information of the pre&s;ent opening for u&s;efulne&s;s, the following &s;peeches of &s;ome of their chiefs, and extracts of letters from others who have been taught to read and write, are &s;elected from a con&s;iderable number which &s;peak the &s;ame language, from different tribes.</P>

<P>When I was young and &s;trong our country was full of game, which the good Spirit &s;ent for us to live upon; the lands which belonged to us were extended far beyond where we hunted; I and the people of my nation had enough to eat, and always &s;omething to give to our friends when they entered our cab|bins; and we rejoiced when they received it from us: hunting was then not tire&s;ome, it was diver&s;ion, it was a plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><HI>Brothers,</HI></P>
<P>When your fathers a&s;ked land from my nation; we gave it to them, for we had more than enough: Gaya&s;huta was among&s;t the fir&s;t of the people to &s;ay, "Give land to our brother Onas, for he wants it," and he has always been a friend to Onas, and to his children.</P>

He is very old and feeble and he wonders at his own &s;hadow it is become &s;o little. He has no children to take care of him, and the game is driven away by the white people, &s;o that the young men mu&s;t hunt all day long to find game for them&s;elves to eat; they have nothing left for Gaya&s;huta. And it is not Gaya&s;huta only, who is become old and feeble, there yet re|main about thirty men of your old friends, who, unable to
