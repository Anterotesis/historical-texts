<OPENER><SALUTE>Chri&s;tian Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOU ha&s;t here pre&s;ented to thy View, <HI>A GLIMPSE of GLORY</HI> from the heavenly <HI>Zion,</HI> &s;o bright and lively, as nothing of humane Compo&s;ure, yet extant, can equal. A Ray of &s;uch hea|venly Fire, as, being received into an Heart affected with Eternal Objects, may prove a ble&s;t Mean to inflame it into a Divine Rapture of holy Longing, to &s;ee, and enjoy the&s;e un&s;een Things, which are here in &s;o bright Colours repre&s;ented. Who&s;oever will in Sincerity, and with At|tention, peru&s;e this &s;mall TREATISE, will be led in|to &s;uch a delightful Contemplation of divine and heaven|ly Things, as may, in a Manner, tran&s;port his very Soul into that heavenly <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI>; carry him along the beau|tiful Banks of that pure River of the Water of Life; and repre&s;ent to the Eyes of his Mind, that noble and glorious Company that &s;tands about the LAMB, on Mount <HI>Zion,</HI> in white Robes, with Palms in their Hands, &s;inging a new Song of Prai&s;e to JEHOVAH and the LAMB. Here &s;hall he find the incomparable Beauties of that upper <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> and royal Palace of the King of Kings, de&s;cribed &s;o brightly, in &s;uch high and lofty Expre&s;&s;ions, as well &s;uit the&s;e &s;ublime and &s;upernatural Objects; and yet withal &s;o ea&s;y to be under&s;tood, that
<PB N="iv" REF="005510_0003_101848B56311F760">
the meane&s;t Capacity, exerci&s;ed in &s;piritual Things may apprehend the true Sen&s;e and Meaning of them. The holy Heart of the Author has been &s;o much in Heaven, that from the End of the <HI>Prelude,</HI> to the Conclu&s;ion, he talks altogether like one in Heaven already, and as a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the GLORY he de&s;cribes: Which is to be attentively noticed, for the better under&s;tanding of the Scope and Intent of the Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the De&s;cription of Heaven, and the Glory which the Saints &s;hall enjoy there; (which is the profe&s;&s;ed Sub|ject of the Book:) There are not a few other excellent Subjects inter&s;per&s;ed, and pretty largely handled. How &s;weetly doth he expatiate upon the Prai&s;es of Chri&s;t, the ever-ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer? How lively doth he de&s;cribe him, in his humbled State: his humble, laborious, &s;orrowful, yet holy Life; his painful, &s;hameful and accur&s;ed Death; his infinite Love to his Cho&s;en, that put him upon all that voluntary Humiliation and Suffering? With what Ravi&s;hment doth he admire the Difference of the&s;e Two, &s;o di&s;tant E&s;tates? In what &s;weet, lively and bright Ex|pre&s;&s;ions doth he declare the mutual Intercour&s;e betwixt this glorious Redeemer, and his Cho&s;en, e&s;pecially in the upper HOUSE? It is al&s;o another great Aim of the Author, to di&s;play the Attributes of GOD, to his Glory: His Grace &amp; Mercy towards the Elect; his Sovereignty in his Works of Creation, Providence, and e&s;pecially Election; his Truth &amp; Faithfulne&s;s, in making good all his Promi&s;es; his Unchangeablene&s;s, in his Purpo&s;es of Love and Grace to his own; his &s;potle&s;s Holine&s;s and Ju&s;tice, in puni&s;hing the Wicked. How lofty is he in de&s;cribing the Sovereignty of God over his Creatures; either to create, or not create, elect, or pa&s;s by, as he plea&s;ed? How &s;weet, large &amp; ravi&s;hing is he, in holding forth the FREEDOM &amp; RICHES of REDEEMING GRACE! And how doth he exult and glory in the Unchangeablene&s;s of God, which &s;ecures the &s;ame to all Eternity? His wonderful Wi&s;dom, in contriving the
<PB N="v" REF="005510_0003_101848B56311F760">
Saints Way to the Kingdom, thro' a Life of Sufferings, Afflictions, Poverty, Labours, Watchings, Sorrows, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is plea&s;antly cleared up; and many my&s;terious Provi|dences, relating thereunto, judiciou&s;ly unfolded; which may &s;erve much for Confirmation and Con&s;olation to many poor drooping Believers. In de&s;cribing the Holi|ne&s;s and Ju&s;tice of God, in the eternal Puni&s;hment of the Damned, he takes Occa&s;ion largely to delineate the mi&s;e|rable E&s;tate of the Ungodly: Nor is this improper for his Subject; for Contraries, &s;et be&s;ide other, &s;erve to in|lighten one another. He &s;ets forth their extreme Mi&s;ery from the Greatne&s;s of their Torments; the great and in|conceivable Lo&s;s they undergo, in their eternal Bani&s;h|ment from the Pre&s;ence of GOD and the LAMB; the Eternity, yet Ju&s;tice of their Puni&s;hment: Which Ju&s;tice he founds not on an arbitrary Con&s;titution, but on the infinite Holine&s;s, Ju&s;tice and Sovereignty of God, again&s;t whom Sin is an infinite Offence, as &s;triking again&s;t his very BEING and GLORY; and therefore de&s;erving an Infinity of Puni&s;hment. The Bla&s;phemies they con|tinually belch forth again&s;t their Creator, for his puni|&s;hing them, tho' at the &s;ame Time their Con&s;ciences ap|prove him ju&s;t; and their horrid Inclination to fulfil their Lu&s;ts, tho' they cannot: All which he reckons their Pu|ni&s;hment, as well as their Sin, for he was at no Lo&s;s to believe, <HI>That there is Sinning in Hell.</HI> And finally here is &s;et forth the holy Triumph of the Righteous over the Wicked, Devils and Men, once their mortal Enemies; now laid low under the Soles of their Feet, and for ever bani&s;hed their holy and happy Society. All which the Author de&s;cribes in &s;uch a moving and pathetick Manner as might cau&s;e an Adamantine Heart to relent &amp; tremble, and to enquire, <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved? How &s;hall I e&s;cape the Wrath to come?</HI></P>
<P>And indeed, to bring Souls to &s;uch a &s;erious Enquiry, and draw Hearts from this ba&s;e, empty Earth, to an In|que&s;t after Heaven and Salvation, is the great Aim of the
<PB N="vi" REF="005510_0004_101848B8565A5210">
Author through all this Book. And hence, how pathe|tick and vigorous is he, in his Inviting, Per&s;wading, and Rea&s;oning with the Unconverted (whom he commonly &s;tiles <HI>Worldlings,</HI> becau&s;e yet intangled in the Lu&s;ts of the World) to awaken them to a due Concern about hea|venly Things, and wean their Hearts from earthly Vani|ties; and by le&s;&s;ening their E&s;teem of them, to draw their Affections from them?</P>
<P>And that &s;uch as are per&s;waded, &s;eriou&s;ly to mind and apply them&s;elves to this noble and nece&s;&s;ary Study, may not want an Help at Hand, to di&s;cover to them the Good|ne&s;s or Badne&s;s of their E&s;tate: He hath added in the Conclu&s;ion of the Work a con&s;iderable Number of Excel|lent Marks or Notes, whereby a Chri&s;tian may di&s;cern his being in Chri&s;t, and whether he be in an heavenly Frame, or not; al&s;o by them a formal Hypocrite may be detected.</P>
<P>If there be any Flights of lofty and &s;ublime Thought, here and there, that may offend the Cen&s;orious, 'tis de|&s;ired, That before they cen&s;ure, they would fir&s;t compare them with the Similitudes and Expre&s;&s;ions of holy Scrip|ture, and next with the Sentiments of &s;ound Divines, gi|ving &s;ome Grains of Allowance, on Con&s;ideration of the &s;ublime and rapturous Way of writing, here u&s;ed; and, 'tis confidently pre&s;umed, they'll find Nothing, but what is mo&s;t agreeable to Truth, in this whole Tractate. There is a Sentence, Sect. 54, where he &s;eems to make <HI>Sincerity</HI> the Condition of the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> as Perfecti|on of Obedience was the Condition of the <HI>Covenant of Works</HI>; which may perhaps offend &s;ome, who di&s;like the very Term <HI>Condition in a Covenant of Grace.</HI> But who|&s;oever con&s;iders how large and pathetick he is, in de|&s;cribing the free Grace of God, and a&s;cribing all the Glo|ry of Redemption and Salvation to Chri&s;t, and only to Chri&s;t, mu&s;t be per&s;waded, he cannot mean, that the Be|liever's Sincerity, or any Grate of his what&s;oever, is the Condition of the New Covenant, in a legal Sen&s;e; for &s;o
<PB N="vii" REF="005510_0004_101848B8565A5210">
Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s alone is the Condition of that Co|venant. Nor can we charitably judge, That this Term, <HI>Condition,</HI> is in any wor&s;e or &s;tricter Sen&s;e affirmed of <HI>Sincerity,</HI> which pre&s;uppo&s;eth and includes Faith, than it is of Faith it &s;elf, in the 32 <HI>An&s;wer</HI> of our <HI>Larger Cate|chi&s;m.</HI> It is clear then, That the Author takes <HI>Condition</HI> in a large Sen&s;e, for any Thing required or accepted in the new Covenant: And &s;o it is true, That as <HI>Adam</HI>'s Works were to be perfect, in Order to Acceptation; &s;o the Believer's good Works cannot be accepted without Sincerity; and will, thro' Chri&s;t, be accepted when Sin|cere: Which mu&s;t certainly be all the Author intends by <HI>Condition</HI> in that Place.</P>
<P>He is al&s;o pretty po&s;itive in his Opinion of the Reno|vation of the Earth and vi&s;ible Heavens, at the Day of Judgment; which he de&s;cribes in bright and beautiful Emblems. The Opinion is indeed controverted among the Learned: But mo&s;t of the Orthodox are of the Au|thor's Side. Hence, when he is &s;peaking of Things in that renewed State, after the Day of Judgment, none needs marvel, that he calls <HI>Sun, Moon</HI> and <HI>Stars everla&s;ting,</HI> and the Earth an <HI>eternal Monument,</HI> as in Sect. 43; Or, &s;tum|ble at any &s;uch uncommon Expre&s;&s;ions: For he &s;peaks as one beyond Time in Eternity.</P>
<P>Moreover, the intelligent and ob&s;erving Reader will here find &s;uch a &s;urpri&s;ing Variety of the mo&s;t profound Go&s;pel-My&s;teries, interwoven in &s;uch a beautiful and art|ful Contexture, as will every where entertain his Under|&s;tanding, with an uncommon Delight.</P>
<P>'Tis hoped, none will de&s;iderate Method, or quarrel the Want thereof as a Defect; if it be but reminded, That devotional Books, among&s;t which this may ju&s;tly claim a chief Room, are not u&s;ually a&s;tricted to the Rules of Art and <HI>Logical</HI> Method: It being the De&s;ign of &s;uch Writers, not &s;o much to plea&s;e the Fancy, or entertain the Under&s;tanding with an orderly Ranging &amp; Methodi|zing of Things, as to quicken and inflame the Affections
<PB N="viii" REF="005510_0005_101848BC60F3D250">
with divine and &s;ublime Meditations: Where, not a Gingle of empty Eloquence fills the Ear; but heavenly and &s;upernatural Objects, brought down, as it were, from the eternal World of Spirits, and made familiar to the Under&s;tanding, move and engage the Heart, and ele|vate the Soul to follow hard after the&s;e only worthy and &s;ub&s;tantial Delights. And be&s;ides, the intelligent Reader will find upon due Peru&s;al, that 'tis not a meer rude Heap of indige&s;ted Matter; but that there is really a comely Order ob&s;erved, in the Di&s;po&s;ing of the Thoughts herein contained, which will &s;ufficiently gratifie the Under|&s;tanding, while the incomparable Matter melts and in|flames the Affections.</P>
<P>As for the Titles of the Sections, the Publi&s;hers were not a&s;&s;ured, whether they were added by the Author him&s;elf, or by &s;ome other Hand: Nay, they did not want Ground of Su&s;picion, both from the Difference of Expre&s;&s;ion, and &s;ometimes from the Un&s;uitablene&s;s to the Matter, that &s;ome le&s;s &s;kilful Per&s;on had added them. Yet having no Copies &s;ave one (except the Letters, and Saint's Song, whereof we found &s;everal Copies) to com|pare, 'twas tho't &s;afe&s;t to retain them, le&s;t any Thing might be de&s;iderate that was in the Manu&s;cript: And the judicious Reader is left to his Choice, whether to read on the Matter, without Regard to the&s;e Titles, or otherwi&s;e; for it mu&s;t be owned, That, con&s;idering the Variety of heavenly Purpo&s;es, &s;ometimes comprized in one of the&s;e Paragraphs, 'tis no ea&s;ie Matter for any Man to devi&s;e an appo&s;ite Title, to expre&s;s the Sub&s;tance of the Matter therein contained.</P>
<P>There is no Doubt, but the Reader, by this Time, will be longing for &s;ome Account of the Author: And it were to be wi&s;hed, that a true and genuine Relation of the Life of that pious Youth could have been recovered, in or|der further to oblige the Publick; which had it been pra|cticable, no Pains would have been &s;pared to tran&s;mit it: And without all Doubt, &s;uch a Life would have been a
<PB N="ix" REF="005510_0005_101848BC60F3D250">
rare and excellent Draught, worthy of Chri&s;tian Imitation. He was the Son of a godly Father, Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;|pel at <HI>Tondergirth</HI> in <HI>Annandole</HI>; concerning whom there is related this remarkable Pa&s;&s;age. When the LORD had taken away from him his beloved Wife, the De&s;ire of his Eyes, he &s;pent the whole en&s;uing Night in Prayer and Medication in his Garden. One of the Elders of the Pari&s;h coming next Morning to vi&s;it him, and condoling his Want of Re&s;t by Rea&s;on of the Di&s;pen&s;ation &s;o lately befal|len him, he replied thus, or to this Effect: <Q>I declare I have not all this Night had one Thought concerning the Death of my Spou&s;e; I have been &s;o wholly taken up with the Meditation of heavenly Things. I have been this Night upon the Banks of <HI>Ulai,</HI> plucking an Apple here and there.</Q> This Pa&s;&s;age plainly &s;hews what a heavenly Soul this holy Man hath been; and how plentifully this gracious Youth, his Son, hath been ble&s;&s;ed with the &s;ame Spirit, is abundantly evident from the en&s;u|ing Treati&s;e. His Brother Mr. <HI>John Welwood</HI> was a Per|&s;on well known to many, and his Memory &s;till favory to all that knew him, for his Holine&s;s, Diligence in the La|bours of the Mini&s;try, amid&s;t many Perils from Bloody Per&s;ecutors and fal&s;e Brethren; his undaunted Zeal and Courage in the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, tho' under a very weak and &s;ickly Con&s;titution of Body. What a Life of Faith he lived in the&s;e Perillous Times, is evident from &s;everal Letters of his, written to his Godly Acquaintances, and Friends, yet extant in Manu&s;cript. And as he excelled in the Grace of Faith, &s;o this holy Youth, the Author, &s;eems to have peculiarly abounded in that of Love, as will be abundantly manife&s;t from the whole of this heavenly Tra|ctate. And how zealous he was for the royal Prerogatives of his lovely Redeemer, u&s;urped by wicked Rulers; and the public Concerns of His Hou&s;e and Glory; may be gathered from &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages in this Treati&s;e, tho' the Nature of the Subject did not permit him to enlarge much this Way. It appears plainly, from his Letters annexed
<PB N="x" REF="005510_0006_101848BE23DD84C0">
to this Treati&s;e, that he de&s;igned to have &s;erved the Lord Chri&s;t in the Work of the Mini&s;try, if it had plea&s;ed the Lord to have continued his Abode here below: But the good Lord was plea&s;ed early to tran&s;port him from the Wilderne&s;s of Earth to the Paradi&s;e of Glory; and to accept the Will, in that Matter, for the Deed, as him|&s;elf &s;peaketh. He died at <HI>London,</HI> in Time of our late Per|&s;ecution, as would &s;eem, of a Con&s;umption; under which Affliction, how much he profited and grew in Grace, ap|pears al&s;o evidently from the &s;ame Letters. He conclu|ded his holy and happy, tho' &s;hort, Life, with the &s;wee|te&s;t A&s;&s;urance of obtaining that Coele&s;tial Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, he here de&s;cribes, and quietly &s;lept in the Lord. And tho' the re&s;t of the Hi&s;tory of his Life cannot here be com|mitted to Writing, (as was de&s;ign'd, if certain Informa|tion could have been obtained) yet there is here a ge|nuine Tran&s;cript of it to be read; for no doubt he en|deavour'd to live what he wrote, and &s;uch a la&s;ting Monu|ment erected to the Glory of his Redeemer, as will al&s;o &s;erve to tran&s;mit his Memory embalmed to Po&s;terity, without needing an Elogium from any other Hand.</P>
<P>To conclude, the Treati&s;e it &s;elf will, upon due Pe|ru&s;al, &s;o approve it &s;elf to every gracious Heart, by its heavenly and divine Strain; the noble De&s;ign it drives, namely to exalt Chri&s;t, and allure Souls to him, by its mo&s;t &s;weet and taking Compo&s;ure; its Stile being both lofty, as to the Subject, and conde&s;cending to the mo&s;t I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">literate; and finally by the &s;weet Di&s;coveries it makes of that holy City, the heavenly <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> the Hope, Re&s;t and Joy of all the Saints: The Treati&s;e, I &s;ay, will &s;o recommend it &s;elf, as that it &s;hall need no Ivy to be hung out to invite the Pa&s;&s;enger; and will only need to be known, to recommend it &s;ufficiently to every de|vout Soul.</P>
<P>That the Almighty Lord, with whom is the Re&s;idue of the Spirit, and who only can command the Ble&s;&s;ing, may make this TREATISE a ble&s;&s;ed Mean, in the Hand

Natural Wi&s;dom, never &s;o inten&s;e, is not Glory: The Splendor of the Sun, tho' a thou&s;and Stages gradually augmented above what it is, is &s;till but natural Glory, and not a &s;upernatural Elevati|on.

The Wooing-time &s;eemed &s;mall and incon&s;iderable; O the Marriage is wonderfully glorious and excellent! What e&s;teemed a ba&s;e World of thy great Call, when thou &s;ent thine Am|ba&s;&s;adors to call them unto this everla&s;ting Supper? How did they &s;light &s;uch an a&s;toni&s;hing Di&s;pen&s;ation, as a well-invented Fancy, and turned them&s;elves wholly to their Earthly Enjoyments, as being the only real Things, which affected their <HI>bruti&s;h Minds?</HI> Do you not now &s;ee your de&s;perate Madne&s;s, O vile Worldlings?

You have gotten your Choice, a momentany Enjoyment of Earth have you received: This boundle&s;s Joy you never cared for. If you have done wi&s;ely, re|joice therein throughout Eternity.

Did&s;t thou not <HI>play fa&s;t</HI> and <HI>loo&s;e</HI> with JESUS, as all others? When He &s;aw, he could not prevail with thee, more than others, (all Mankind being alike in their Orignal) He put in his Hand by the <HI>Hole of the Door,</HI> and then cau&s;ed <HI>thy Bowels be moved for him</HI>: He filled thine Heart, <HI>ere ever thou wa&s;t aware,</HI> with his overcoming Love and Sweetne&s;s. Thou wa&s;t hearing the Sound of this Go&s;pel in a dead and natural Way, but he breathed upon all thy Faculties, and &s;aid unto thee, Live; and thou aro&s;e from the Dead, and heard, and &s;aw Wonders in the Go&s;pel, that blind &s;tupid World|lings could never perceive. Had he &s;uffered thee to follow thy natural Inclinations, thou had&s;t marched on, to end|le&s;s De&s;truction, contrary to all his loving Invitations. Nay, but &s;ince from Eternity he had cho&s;en thee, of his own good Plea&s;ure, out of the Ma&s;s of Mankind, He could not but manife&s;t his Love to thee, in Time, in a &s;pecial Manner; and therefore he pa&s;t from Intreaty, to Ravi&s;h|ments, and drew thee with &s;uch &s;trong <HI>Cords of Love,</HI> that thou could&s;t not but yield.

And no Wonder the Saint cannot want Chri&s;t, &s;ince he is transformed into his lovely Image, a Partaker of his divine Nature; one, who is endued with the &s;ame Mind that was in him; one, who hath Chri&s;t <HI>dwelling in him</HI>; one, who hath <HI>the Kingdom of Heaven within him</HI>: So that it is natural unto him to tend God-ward, and Heaven-ward; even as it is natural for the Worldling to tend Earth-ward and Hell-ward. Every Thing hath a Propen&s;ity and Love to its own Centre and Like; and bends off from its Oppo&s;ite: The Fire a&s;cends towards the Centre and great Glob of Fire; every Bit of Earth disjoined, tends back to the whole again. Tho' there were neither Reward, nor Puni&s;hment; yet a holy One mu&s;t love, &s;erve, obey, prai&s;e and adore his God; for Heaven mu&s;t operate like Heaven, even nece&s;&s;arily, tho'

freely, &s;weetly, and without Compul&s;ion. Again, World|lings mu&s;t tend Earth-ward, tho' they &s;hould find never &s;o much Vexation, Torment and Grief in it; tho' he &s;hould never be &s;o often threatned, and per&s;waded of all the Mi&s;eries that follow an earthly, &s;en&s;ual and bruti&s;h Way of living; &s;ince he is all Sen&s;e, Earth and Corrup|tion, altogether de&s;titute of the Divine Nature: In a Word, a Worldling is a vi&s;ible incarnate Devil; a Saint, a vi&s;ible incarnate Angel: Only Hell, on this Side of Time, is not fully accompli&s;hed in the one; nor Heaven fully perfected in the other. The holy One &s;mells &s;trongly of Glory; and the nearer he approacheth to his Journey's End, the more re&s;plendent a Lu&s;tre hath he of Heaven: <HI>The Path of the Ju&s;t</HI> being <HI>as the &s;hining Light, that &s;hi|neth more and more unto the perfect Day.</HI> O Tincture of Heaven! Their Actions have &s;till a greater Smell of Glo|ry; but all is nothing to the Glory and Excellency of their invi&s;ible and inward Operation: Little or nothing appears without, in Compari&s;on of that which is within. O the noble and &s;eraphick Thoughts! O the &s;trange Mo|tions of Love, and Joy, and Admiration, above all po&s;&s;i|ble Expre&s;&s;ion! O the ravi&s;hing Perfumes of pa&s;&s;ing Joys and Sweetne&s;s, wherewith the Beloved fills the Heart! It is impo&s;&s;ible for the Saint, to put down in Black and White, what he feels on his Soul: All the Tongues of Men and Angels cannot manife&s;t his &s;weet and noble Thoughts of his only WELBELOVED. He would glad|ly expre&s;s them to all that are about him, but he finds it impo&s;&s;ible. He is &s;ometimes contending with his nar|row Fancy, that it cannot find out a more &s;ublime, clear and excellent Way of expre&s;&s;ing the matchle&s;s Worth of his Welbeloved: Other whiles, he is angry at the cold, &s;hallow and putid Manner of others Di&s;cour&s;ing: He would have all Men &s;peak nobly, write nobly, do nobly, for Je&s;us. Nothing vexeth him more than to perceive the Generality of Men forget him: Or, when they &s;peak of him, to talk &s;o coldly and creepingly, as if he were a

common, ordinary Beloved. He would have his Lovely One filling the Hearts and Mouths of all: He hates the Fellow&s;hip where he is not highly e&s;teemed, loved, prai&s;ed and adored: He greatly honours, and loves that, (tho' otherwi&s;e never &s;o low and de&s;picable) where he is prai|&s;ed, wor&s;hipped and much accounted of. It is his conti|nual Torment and Affliction, he hath &s;o low and unbe|&s;eeming Thoughts of him: He is in great Rage at his Heart, that it &s;hould, at any Time, go a&s;tray, from &s;uch an excellent Object, after Vanity: He lays Bands on, watcheth over, and commands his Heart, that it have no|ble and excellent Thoughts of him; and entertain no other Beloveds be&s;ide him: He de&s;ires Nothing more, than to have his Heart wholly &s;et upon him, and forever ravi&s;hed and overcome with his Love. And no Wonder; &s;ince Chri&s;t, and he are One; One in Nature, Mind, Affections, Spirit, and all Things: As the Lord Je&s;us is, &s;o is he, in a great Part. Every one of the Saints re&s;em|bles the Children of the King of Kings: Among all the Sons of <HI>Adam,</HI> there are none their like; for they are <HI>a cho&s;en Generation, a royal Prie&s;thood, an holy Nation, a peculiar People; that they &s;hould &s;hew forth the Prai&s;es of him, who hath called them out of Darkne&s;s unto his mar|vellous Light.</HI> The Generality of Mankind hath, ever from the very Beginning, looked upon them, as &s;trange Manner of Per&s;ons, &amp; nick-named them with various and &s;trange Sorts of Names, according to the Iniquities of the Times and Places they lived in, becau&s;e of their Rare|ne&s;s in Number, Singularity in their Way of Living and Practice, Preci&s;ene&s;s in their Principles, and oppo|&s;ing the Sins of the Times their Lot is ca&s;t into.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Mother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF I were able to dictate now, when I am entring into Eternity, I could tell you the Con&s;olations, where|with I am comforted of God, even when the chiefe&s;t Delights of the World, the&s;e Trifles, upon which the Sons of Men dote, can be no Comfort to me. Alas! what are all the Comforts, that flee away at Death? Even the Vanities of Time, which cannot convoy a Man with|out the Borders of Time; and far le&s;s endure with him through Eternity. My Death would &s;eem Judicial-like to blind Worldlings, who &s;ee no Judgment, but to be de|prived of the empty and ta&s;tele&s;s Vanities of Time; But I &s;ee, That <HI>all Things work together for Good to them, who are the Called according to his Purpo&s;e</HI>: Even Dif|ficulties Temptations, Griefs and Woes have all an happy End to the Godly: <HI>Out of the Eater cometh Meat, and out of the Strong cometh Sweetne&s;s</HI>: So, even eating and con|&s;uming Griefs, Sickne&s;s and Lo&s;&s;es, which make the out|ward Man decay, renew the inward Man, and make him flouri&s;h; Even the &s;tronge&s;t Difficulties, Temptations and Foes, when overcome, yield the &s;weete&s;t Victory: And the Thoughts of having ru&s;hed through &s;o many Ene|mies, and &s;o &s;trong, &s;hall be &s;weet throughout Eternity. I &s;ee clearly, all the Steps of divine Providence toward me, have con&s;pired to a ble&s;&s;ed Clo&s;e; even the mo&s;t difficult of them, e&s;pecially this Half-Year: I would not,

for never &s;o much, but that I die were I die, and am &s;ick in this Place; for his Di&s;pen&s;ations have a wonderful Depth in them, &amp; cannot well be di&s;cerned, but by Eyes inlightned from above. But Worldlings are blind, and vary &s;trangely in their Judgment of Things; and even the Saints, while here, are much blinded with Sin and Infir|mities of this over-powering Mortality: Death has in|deed a terrible Face to the&s;e, that place all their Happi|ne&s;s in this Life; but I fear it not; it is not Death, but an Harbinger of Glory unto me: It is an hard-favoured Me&s;&s;enger, &s;ent from my &s;weet <HI>Lord</HI> to me; 'Tis a dark and &s;ad Chariot carrying to the Land of Light and Joy. My <HI>LORD</HI> hath done to me, what he hath determined from Eternity; and all his Purpo&s;es, even all the Tho'ts of his Heart, are full of Love, infinite Love, to tho&s;e that wait upon him. I re&s;olved to glorify him on Earth, and dedicated my Life wholly to my <HI>LORD's</HI> Service; and I know it is all one with him, as if I had done it: And I &s;hall, in another Manner, exalt and &s;erve him above, than I could have done here below, weighted with Mor|tality, and innumerable Infirmities. My <HI>Lord</HI> hath &s;aid to me, It would weary thee, to &s;tay too long in this Val|ley of Tears and Mi&s;ery; I take it, as if thou had&s;t done me many Years Service: I have abridged thy Days, but not thy Life: I have &s;hortned thy Toiling, but not thy Reward. And O what a ble&s;&s;ed Thing it is, that He takes the Ta&s;k of many weary Years Service off my Hand! My Warfare is ended; O the joyful Change I am undergoing! When &s;hall I &s;ee Him, as He is; When &s;hall I get my Fill of lovely Je&s;us? O his Beauty, his Beauty, his Beauty! Men and Angels may admire the Freene&s;s of his Grace, and admire it, and ever admire it! But what can they &s;ay, or comprehend of it? O the Freene&s;s of his Grace! that he &s;hould admit the like of me to &s;tand eternally before him, and to be for ever in his Pre&s;ence; to be one of his honourable Train; Nay, to enjoy him, as near as can be! O! think ye, I lo&s;e any

O, the beholding of the Face of the Ancient of Days! But I know in whom I have belie|ved; and that he is able to pre&s;ent me &s;potle&s;s before the Father, with exceeding great Joy.

O, the Difference betwixt this melancholious, &s;moky Inn, and the Magnificent Hall of Glory! O the Change I am undergoing! I go from the Twilight of the Sun and Moon, to the Noon-day of the Splendour of Glory; from a Dunghil, to a Throne; from bodily Infirmities, Di&s;|tre&s;&s;es, Di&s;ea&s;es, and Pains, to a Land, who&s;e Inhabitants do not &s;ay, I am &s;ick; from weari&s;om Labour and Toil|ing, into an inconceivable &s;weet Paradi&s;e, where I &s;hall re&s;t for evermore; from a mortal Company, to an innu|merable immortal <HI>Company of Angels, to the General A&s;|&s;embly,

of Joys! Death is far mi&s;taken by the mo&s;t Part of Saints, they have a wrong Conception of it; It is a &s;weet Repo&s;e to a weary Soul, and loo&s;eth the Soul from the Bands of Mortality, letting it out from a filthy, &s;tinking Pri&s;on, unto the &s;weet and fragrant Air of Glory; It ends all Sorrows and Sighings, and begins un&s;peakable Joys: 'Tis but a dark Cloud u&s;hering in the bright Dawn|ing of eternal Glory. O but my Lord hath excellent|ly circum&s;tantiated my Death! O I admire his Love! I could tell many &s;weet Pa&s;&s;ages of Providences he hath ca&s;t in my Way: But I delay, until I be &s;itting upon the Brink of the River of Life; and then I &s;hall number them: I cannot now prai&s;e him; Alas that I am &s;o &s;tu|pid and dull; but I &s;hall prai&s;e him anon, I &s;hall eter|nally prai&s;e him! <HI>O be glad and rejoice in our God!</HI> O &s;weet! that poor, dying, mi&s;erable I was not left to Uncertainties, not to know what to do; but to have &s;uch a &s;weet and kind Lord to repo&s;e on! Had I &s;tayed long|er in this wretched Life, I was re&s;olved to have &s;hown my &s;elf as faithful to you as I could: But I commit you unto his Grace, who hath cared for me, even unto Death: Commit your &s;elf to him, he will bring all to a good I&s;&s;ue that is tru&s;ted to him. We are not our own; therefore we are not to di&s;po&s;e of our &s;elves. CHRIST is a good Tutor and Governour, and carries all the&s;e well through, that commit them&s;elves to him. See that <HI>Mary</HI> neglect not Seeking of God, Praying, Reading of the Scriptures; Let her not frequent ill Company. O the Worth of a Soul! and the Reward of the&s;e, that are in|&s;trumental in gaining of a Soul! Our Bodies mu&s;t go to the Du&s;t; but our Souls are of more Worth than Ten thou&s;and Worlds.

I am &s;ure, and you are as &s;ure, Not to eat, and drink, and pa&s;s away your Time in earthly Bu&s;ine&s;s; but to get the Work of your Salvation well wrought and fini|&s;hed, before Death a&s;&s;ault you: It is mo&s;t uncertain, and &s;teals upon Men, as a <HI>Thief in the Night,</HI> when they are &s;ecure, never dreaming of &s;uch a great Change: Tho' truly my Gracious LORD lets me &s;ee Death &s;till ap|proaching nearer and nearer; that I may draw ever near|er and nearer him, who is Life. O! it concerns you, to try, Whether you &s;hall be a ba&s;e Mi&s;creant, crawling in the Bottomle&s;s Pit, with un&s;peakable Torments, in the Mid&s;t of wicked Men and Devils, bla&s;pheming Jehovah and the Lamb to Eternity; or, a glorious Saint, confor|med unto the Image of the SON of the eternal GOD, loving, prai&s;ing, adoring him, that &s;itteth on the Throne, and the Lamb, for ever and ever. Con&s;ider what I &s;ay, The Bu&s;ine&s;s is &s;o weighty, &s;o exceeding weighty, that Time, with all its Well and Wo, is to be overlooked, in Compari&s;on of this ab&s;olutely and only nece&s;&s;ary Thing: I tell you, There is an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity, that you be

holy (let not the Poor Name affright you; for Holine&s;s is the &s;weete&s;t, and mo&s;t ea&s;y Thing in the World, to them that are holy:) For, <HI>Without Holine&s;s, no Man &s;hall &s;ee the LORD</HI>: And Salvation mu&s;t be nearer your Heart, by many Degrees, than all other Concernments, tho' they were Ten thou&s;and Worlds. You mu&s;t know the Bargain of the New Covenant, &amp; clo&s;e heartily with it, in all its Fulne&s;s, without the lea&s;t Re&s;ervation: Upon it, I recommend unto you Mr. <HI>Guthry</HI>'s <HI>Trial of a &s;a|ving Intere&s;t in CHRIST</HI>; and de&s;ire you to read it, till you become &s;uch an one, as he de&s;cribes. Believe it, <HI>Godline&s;s is profitable for all Things; having the Promi&s;es of this Life, and that which is to come.</HI> Tho' it may &s;eem trouble&s;om in the Beginning; and tho' Chri&s;t's &s;weet and ea&s;y Yoke may &s;eem an hard Wreath; yet believe me, there is Nothing in the World, but it, which can give Re&s;t, and full Satisfaction to the Soul: All Things here are un&s;atisfying, tho' you had all that you can de&s;ire of them. O this is a vain World! The&s;e who are near Eternity will &s;ay &s;o. O the va&s;t Difference betwixt Time and Eternity! I a&s;&s;ure you, if you had all that your Heart could wi&s;h or de&s;ire of the Pomp, Trea&s;ures and Plea&s;ures of Time, you would find no Contentment in them: And when you &s;hall be in &s;uch a Condition, as I am in, when pale Death &s;hall be &s;taring you in the Face; then all the Glory of Time will be, in your Eyes, nothing but a withered Flower. But alas! we are drunk with this World; and we never know well what we are doing, till Death make us &s;ober. I mu&s;t &s;ay again, and again, O the Difference betwixt Time, &amp; Eternity! They that get Heaven, can get no more; for, alas! What are all Additions of Time? What is a few Days Eating, and Drinking, &amp; Trifling? Yea, what are all the ma&s;&s;ie Exer|ci&s;es of Time, compared with the Exerci&s;es of Glory? We place too much of our Happine&s;s in this Side of Time; and therefore Death is a great Di&s;appointer: But we &s;hould be indifferent to all Things in Time, and have our Eyes

ever fixed upon the Thoughts of Eternity: Then 'tis not at all to be regarded, in what Time of a Man's Life he die, if he die in the Lord: Yea, 'tis an invaluable Ble&s;|&s;ing for the Pri&s;oner, or weary Pilgrim, to have all his Toilings by his Hand, and to win to his native Soil. You may think, I put a hard Ta&s;k upon you; becau&s;e our Nature is all polluted, and we are accu&s;tomed to do Evil. But the Ways of Holine&s;s are &s;weet, and <HI>all its Paths are Peace</HI>: If you were once acquainted with the Ways of it, you would &s;ay, That Sin is the mo&s;t ba&s;e and vile Thing in the World; and Holine&s;s is the mo&s;t noble Ornament. And con&s;ider this, The more you &s;et your Mind on Holine&s;s, the more &s;weet and ea&s;y will you find it. As for temporary Things, take no Care for them; they are but Additions to the Son's Inheritance. I may &s;ay by Experience, He hath made good his Word to me in all the&s;e Things of Time; He hath made it good unto the End of my Race, in a mo&s;t &s;trange and wonderful Way: So that I have ta&s;ted more of my Lord's Good|ne&s;s, and wonderful Providence, in this la&s;t Half-year of my Life, than in many Years before: I think it a mer|ciful Di&s;pen&s;ation, that he hath weaned my Heart from the World, more in this Half-Year's Sickne&s;s, than in many Years Health; This whole Half-year of my Life hath been a continual Winter, for bearing down my Corruption, both Original and Actual: And now the World hath no Reli&s;h to me. Farewel, vain World, I heartily &s;ubmit unto Death, if it were for no more, but becau&s;e it is the good Plea&s;ure of my Lord, who mo&s;t mercifully takes me away from the Bondage of my Corruption, and from the dreadful Evils to come. Medi|tate &s;eriou&s;ly on Death: It is a Bu&s;ine&s;s mo&s;t weighty, a Bu&s;ine&s;s upon which your eternal Well or Wo de|pends: The End crowns the Work; die well, and you are well, even well for evermore. And O! is not E|VERMORE a ma&s;&s;ie Word? You &s;hall find Death ea&s;y, if you be a diligent Seeker of God in your Life|time:

If otherwi&s;e, you &s;hall find it the fore&s;t Battle, that ever you fought; and you &s;hall quake, when you &s;hall hear an avenging God &s;peaking audibly in your Con|&s;cience, <HI>He is not mine, take his evil Soul, Devils; pull him to Pieces, and hale him away to utter Darkne&s;s:</HI> The poor Soul wre&s;tles in vain, but an avenging God leaves it for a Prey to Devils. Look not on Death, as afar off: Lit|tle will be the Difference betwixt my Death and yours. This Generation will quickly be gone: Time is a gli&s;te|ring Star, appearing &s;omething before-hand, but indeed it is a tran&s;ient Nothing. And one that dies at Sixty Years of Age, and another that dies at Twenty Years, think both alike, their bypa&s;t Time is a Dream. Short, or long Time is not to be regarded, but in Preparation for Eterni|ty: And he that is prepared, hath lived long enough. I could give you many In&s;tructions, were I not very weak: Beware of ill Company; never think to &s;ee God, if you walk with ill Company: Companions in Time, &amp; Com|panions in Eternity. Lay &s;ome Vows upon your &s;elf; but remember this, That you vow to do nothing, in your own Strength; for you &s;hall find, that when you are weake&s;t in your own Eyes, then are you &s;tronge&s;t: I &s;ay, Lay &s;ome Vows upon your &s;elf, as to pray thrice a Day &s;eriou&s;ly and con&s;cientiou&s;ly; to read &s;o much Scripture; and to mediate. Not that Men are tied to particular Times, but it is mo&s;t profitable to lay Bands upon our loo&s;e Corruptions, which el&s;e will plead for too much Liberty. Imagine not your Thoughts to be free; vain Thoughts are the Source of vain Words, and unprofitable Actions; the Mind is the Spring of all. Be|ware of the Sins of the Time, as you would &s;hun the terrible Judgments that threaten an apo&s;tate Generation: The Pa&s;tors are become bruti&s;h, they are <HI>Sons of</HI> Belial, <HI>and know not the Lord</HI>; therefore they, who hear them, are Partakers of their Abominations. I need &s;ay no more. You never have rightly &s;ought God, until it be your chief Delight to &s;eek him; therefore, never re&s;t till you

can &s;ay, <HI>I will go to God, my chiefe&s;t Joy.</HI> O then you are as happy as God can make you (to &s;peak &s;o, with Reverence to that <HI>High and Lofty One, who inhabits Eternity</HI>) and can you be more happy? I take to wit|ne&s;s again&s;t you, your own Con&s;cience, and the great Judge of the Quick and the Dead, that, if you continue in any vain Imagination, <HI>living without God in the World,</HI> neglecting <HI>&s;o great a Salvation,</HI> you are <HI>a Trampler under Foot of the Blood of the Covenant,</HI> and a De&s;pi&s;er of all Ad|monitions: But all this will do little, until He, who made Heaven and Earth, regenerate you. It may be he will hedge up your Way on every Side by Affliction, that you may be con&s;trained to flee unto him, who is a <HI>pre&s;ent Help in Time of Trouble.</HI> This, if you follow it, is the be&s;t Legacy I could have left you; for, if you knew the Dan|ger of the Pelf of this World, little of it would &s;uffice. I would not for a World, I had been born to be rich: The lighter burdened with thick Clay, the better; 'tis hard to get up the Mount, tho' ye had but a very &s;mall Weight upon your Back: For our Corruptions are weighty e|nough, without any Addition. If you neglect that, which not I, but Chri&s;t commands you, Farewel for ever. If you obey, Farewel for a few Days; and then you and I &s;hall meet, in the only Paradi&s;e, the Flower of the whole Creation: We &s;hall &s;it down upon the flowery Banks of the River of Life, and ravi&s;h our &s;elves for ever and ever, with everla&s;ting and un&s;peakable Joys.

la&s;t Breath upon you, if I could do you any Good. I cannot forget you, even when I have forgotten the Vani|ties of the World; you are precious unto me, &s;ince I knew you in &s;ome Mea&s;ure a Seeker of God. O what Advantages there are in &s;eeking of Him! I defy Men and Angels to number and comprehend them: Endle&s;s Eternity &s;hall be &s;hort enough to lay open the inconcei|vable Gains of Godline&s;s. If you &s;eek him diligently, &s;incerely and con&s;tantly, you &s;hall have all Things: And O is not that a va&s;t Word, ALL THINGS? All &s;hall be yours, <HI>whether the World, Life or Death, Things pre&s;ent, or Things to come</HI>; all the&s;e &s;hall be yours, even the Great ALL, and what&s;oever is his. O but the Saints have a long, large and full Charter! If you had a Char|ter for many Lands, it were but a narrow Thing: But now every Place where you tread on is yours; and what can you de&s;ire more? Beheld the Heaven, and con&s;ider even the Heaven of Heavens; for the&s;e are yours: Is it po&s;&s;ible, that a Saint, the Heir of all Things, and Joint-Heir with the Son of the Eternal; Is it po&s;&s;ible, I &s;ay, that he can want any Thing? Nay, the great Eternal, the Maker of all Things, He is yours; and what can you de&s;ire more? Is it po&s;&s;ible, that a Saint can want any Thing, whether &s;piritual or temporal? I mean any Thing that is good for him: And he alone knows what is be&s;t for us. When I look through the Pa&s;&s;ages of my Life, I &s;ee my Lord and Guide hath led me the be&s;t Way; and the&s;e have been the &s;weete&s;t Di&s;pen&s;ations, which cro&s;&s;ed mo&s;t my natural Di&s;po&s;ition, and which &s;eemed mo&s;t Judgment-like to carnal Eyes. We are like ignorant Children, that have no Judgment to make Choice of Things; but would &s;wallow down &s;weet Poi&s;on, and give away a rich Inheritance for painted Trifles. No Wonder then, the World be Fools and Mad-men in their Choice. My Life hath been but a Tract of Afflictions, and I would not for a Thou&s;and Worlds it had been other|wi&s;e. Tho' my <HI>Old-Man</HI> de&s;ired &s;till to be &s;wiming in the

The la&s;t Part of my Life might &s;eem Judgment-like: But O you would wonder, if you knew what I know, and what my Lord hath done for me, in this la&s;t Half-year of my Life, both as to Things temporal and &s;piritual: I cannot under&s;tand them now, but I &s;hall very &s;hortly; and they &s;hall be to me Matter of eternal Prai&s;e. Tho' I had abounded with all the Ea&s;e, Delights, Pomp &amp; Glo|ry, and Riches of Time; yet would I be glad to die, and leave the Puddle of &s;wini&s;h Plea&s;ures, and drink of the pure River of everla&s;ting Joys, that floweth from be|neath the Throne of GOD. This World quite mi&s;takes Death: O! who would not willingly leave &s;uch a vain peri&s;hing World? wherein we are &s;till di&s;honouring our God; a World wherein the Saints get bad Entertainment; a World wherein the LORD of Glory was, and is daily, crucified: What is here? All the Glory and Excellency of the Creation is up above: A few imperfect Saints are only here. But it is above, I &s;hall &s;ee and embrace all the&s;e Worthies, the Courtiers of the King of Glory. You need not be &s;ad for my Death; and will not, if you po&s;t hard after me, and follow on to know the LORD: For Time is ju&s;t Nothing. We &s;hall be glad and rejoice, with Joy un&s;peakable and full of Glory, throughout all Eterni|ty, in that Land of Glory, and inconceivable Joys. O, if you knew but a little of the Excellency of that Land of Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s! You would, in a Manner, envy tho&s;e who go before you. Tho' you &s;hould pa&s;s never &s;o many &s;weet Days ere you can get thither, you would weary: For your &s;elf, you are yet in an Hell, of Sorrow and Sin, while out of Heaven, and while they are in an Heaven of Joy, and Plea&s;ure. O! Beware of Worldly-mindedne&s;s, &amp; car|ping Cares; Commit all to your Father: <HI>Seek fir&s;t the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Righteou&s;ne&s;s thereof; and then all other Things &s;hall be added unto you.</HI> Fear not, <HI>It is your Father's good Plea&s;ure to give you a Kingdom</HI>:

And he that gives Heaven, will give as much Earth as will &s;uffice you, and more than is &s;ufficient, is a heavy Weight, that will pull you down the Mount.

As for Things temporal, the le&s;s of the World, the better: All the Saints will te&s;tify it, at lea&s;t when they are leaving it. I can put my Seal to it now, when I am entring into Eternity, that it is mo&s;t dangerous to be intangled ei|ther with Riches, Honours, or Plea&s;ures; And that it is the &s;weete&s;t Di&s;pen&s;ation, to be afflicted, and cut &s;hort of them; for Pro&s;perity is the Neck-break of the Life of Godline&s;s, as the Experience of many a deceived Profe&s;|&s;or may te&s;tify; who &s;eemed Something, when afflicted; but when once they got the Bag, betrayed Chri&s;t. 'Tis hard for a <HI>Camel to go through a Needle's Eye</HI>: The more we are inveigled with this deceitful World, the le&s;s do we value Heaven. Now Nothing more glews a Man's Heart to the Earth, than Riches, which have weighed many a Man down to the Pit; where he is weeping and gna&s;hing his Teeth, cur&s;ing Riches, and tor|menting him&s;elf, that ever he de&s;ired them: Whereas, if he had been poor, he &s;hould have been now (as Men may conjecture) rejoicing among&s;t the&s;e glorified Ones. Remember, that it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible to &s;erve God and <HI>Mammon</HI>; And if your Trea&s;ure be not in Heaven, nei|ther will your Heart be there. I ble&s;s my LORD for mine Afflictions (which have been &s;till greater and great|er, till now, I am leaving them all) as much as for any Mercy, I ever received: For now I reap the peaceable Fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, And tho' now I be weeping, while I &s;ow; yet &s;hortly &s;hall I have as much as I can bear of the ma&s;ie Sheaves of unconceivable Glory. <HI>Weep and howl, ye rich Men, for your Mi&s;ery that &s;hall come upon you:</HI> For <HI>you now receive your good Things,</HI>

O! if Men did con&s;ider this, they would not toil for their Ea&s;e and Plea&s;ures of Sin, which are but for a Mo|ment; nor would they envy the rich Gluttons, but ra|ther the poor <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s, that are de&s;picable in the Eyes of all. <HI>Fret not when you &s;ee the Wicked pro&s;per</HI>; nor va|lue Poverty, Shame and Contempt; &s;ince the only excel|lent Ones, <HI>of whom the World was not worthy, wandered about in Sheep-skins, and Goat-skins; being de&s;titute, af|flicted, and tormented:</HI> And the honourable Apo&s;tles, and Followers of the Lamb, were accounted <HI>the Off&s;courings of all Things.</HI> O if the Saints would take Time, &s;it down and con&s;ider the&s;e Things! they would find it &s;weet, to be conformed, in Sufferings, to their Lord, <HI>who was a Man of Sorrows, &amp; acquainted with Grief</HI>; That they might al&s;o be conformed to him in Glory.

I per|&s;wade you, the only Way to have as much of the World as is nece&s;&s;ary and good for you, is to commit your tem|poral Lot wholly to Chri&s;t, without the lea&s;t Re&s;ervation: This is be&s;t; for Nothing can be committed to him, and go wrong: Try him, and if ye do not find that he will carry you bravely through, &s;o that you &s;hall lack Nothing that is good for you, then call him a Liar: Yet, never any of the Saints could &s;ay, he failed them in a Jot of what he promi&s;ed them. And how great are his Promi&s;es! as you will find in Scripture: They are all comprehended in this, <HI>The Lord is a Sun and Shield; he will give Grace and Glory; and no good Thing will he withhold from them that love him, and walk uprightly.</HI>

Eternity! Get &s;ome Sight of it, and your Thoughts &s;hall be wonderfully changed: For, I tell you, could you get a Glimp&s;e of that ma&s;&s;ie Thing, called, ETER|NITY, all the Things in Time &s;hould be no more in your Eyes, than a childi&s;h Toy in the Eyes of a Man. Even the World decked in its be&s;t Robes, &s;eems &s;uch a poor Thing to me, that I would not be at the Pains to &s;tretch out my Hand, if I had it for the taking up; &amp; &s;uch will it &s;eem ere long to many. Worldlings are but Bea&s;ts; and the riche&s;t and mo&s;t flouri&s;hing of them, could you &s;ee them with my Eyes, are but mean Dunghil Worms; their Meditations cannot flee over Time. Then look up|on the World as mad, they know not what they are doing; they value only Time, and yet they know not how to get it pa&s;t away. Be a great Reader of the Scriptures; for there &s;hall you find In&s;truction, to make you wi&s;e to Sal|vation; and thereby you may guide your Steps warily, in an evil Time: There &s;hall you find Threatnings, to rou&s;e you up; and Promi&s;es, to comfort and &s;u&s;tain you in the &s;adde&s;t of Conditions. Reverence the Ordinances, admini&s;tred by faithful Pa&s;tors; for they are the Amba&s;|&s;adors of the Lord, our King: But, abhor fal&s;e Pro|phets, which lead Men into De&s;truction. Alas that there &s;hould be any of Chri&s;t's Servants, who give an ill Ex|ample to the&s;e that are Simple, coun&s;elling them, by their Practice, to follow Thieves &amp; Robbers, who&s;e Voice Chri&s;t's Sheep will not hear. Set, at lea&s;t, three Times a Day apart, for Prayer; for when we neglect that, our Hearts are cold all the Day long; and then we are ea&s;ily &s;nared with any Temptation we meet with. Sometimes meditate, and con&s;ider your Self, and others; that &s;o you may not go on in your Journey like the World, who never ponder their Way, but are led to De&s;truction by their earthly De&s;ires, ru&s;hing into it, as Hor&s;es to the Bat|tle. What have you to do here, but to mind Salvation? Con&s;ider this; for Death will &s;trip you naked of all Things here; but chu&s;e the <HI>one Thing nece&s;&s;ary, that &s;hall never

One Hour of Heaven, yea, one Sight of the Face of the Ancient of Days, would do more than make up all the bitter Affli|ctions I have &s;wimmed through in Time: Nay, I think the very Fore-thoughts of Glory do already &s;wallow up all the Impre&s;&s;ions of the Tribulations of Time, that have &s;eized on me: They are nothing now; they are gone, and &s;hall never return again; Yea, they are, as if they had not been.

No Wonder <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aid, <HI>We look not at the Things that are &s;een, but the Things that are not &s;een; for the Things that are &s;een, are temporal; but the Things that are not &s;een, are eternal:</HI> The Things that are &s;een, were not from Eternity, neither &s;hall they be to Eternity. O then! overlook them: Clo&s;e your Eyes, as it were, upon them; and you &s;hall &s;ee &s;trange Sights, which &s;hall make your Cour&s;e to Glory &s;wift and cheerful? O! what think you of Chri&s;t?

What think you of it, that &s;inful wretched we &s;hould be as happy as can be? Even eternally, and unconceivably happy! and all this purcha&s;ed by the Death and Blood of our kin|de&s;t LORD JESUS? O who would not love &s;uch an

Increated Glory &s;hines through the Vail of his humane Nature: We cannot enjoy God more &s;weetly, familiarly and fully, than through him: He is the ble&s;&s;ed Days-Man betwixt God and Man; the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Him I wi&s;h I could declare evermore: But my la&s;t Words, tho' they were fewer, may have a &s;trong Impre&s;&s;ion upon you.

<P>THough I be almo&s;t amid&s;t Death's Pangs, I cannot forget you; becau&s;e of the &s;weet Friend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hip we have had together; and becau&s;e you are (I'm per&s;waded) one of the Heirs of Glory, and among tho&s;e who wre&s;tle through manifold Temptations, unto the Land of eternal Con&s;olations! O if I could tell you what my Lord hath done for me unto this very Hour; and much more &s;ince I came hither, than in many fore|going Years! I think, if I had Time, I could fill a whole Volume with wonderful Experiences of his Loving-kind|ne&s;s, &s;trange Providences, and &s;weet Cha&s;ti&s;ements: So that an Half-Year may be better than an hundred. 'Tis not the Length of Time, we are to look to: We have a race to run to Heaven; and when we have fini|&s;hed it, we have done. Oh! <HI>Cou&s;in,</HI> even a Saint may live long, and make very &s;mall Progre&s;s to Glory: Yea, many go backward; and it were better for them, they di|ed ere that be, before they di&s;honoured God by their back&s;liding Carriages: Therefore run fa&s;t, <HI>Eye the Joy that is &s;et before you,</HI> and patiently endure all the Temp|tations and Troubles in Time; for your Lord hath promi|&s;ed, that <HI>He will never leave you nor for&s;ake you: And none &s;hall be able to pluck you out of his Hand.</HI> Indeed you may have &s;ore Trials, both outward and inward; but <HI>be of good Courage, and he &s;hall &s;trengthen your Heart</HI>: For you are not to bear your own Burden, but to ca&s;t it fully over upon Him. And I promi&s;e you, in my Lord's Name, you &s;hall be &s;u&s;tained: He is our Strength, our Wi&s;dom, our Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and our All; even all that we want, all that we can de&s;ire.

long or &s;hort Life: but live to die, and then you die to live eternally. O! think much upon Eternity, and you &s;hall think Nothing of Time. Alas! alas! the Things of Time fill our Eyes &s;o, as we never regard Eternity: Yet, Time will be at a Clo&s;e ere ever we be a|ware. I have &s;omewhat the Advantage of you in getting the Fore-&s;tart: But we &s;hall be together perpetually, even immediately; &amp; we &s;hall have another Manner of Con|ver&s;e, than po&s;&s;ibly we could have had on Earth. In Heaven they are not confined to Moments, Days &amp; Years; we &s;hall have Eternity to rejoice and be glad in: O what a Life &s;hall we have, when you and I &s;hall <HI>follow the Lamb whither &s;oever he goes</HI>! When we &s;hall have Sin, Temptations and Mi&s;eries done away! We know not the Excellency of our invaluable Inheritance; and therefore are we &s;o much taken up with earthly Trifles, and Shadows, that are Nothing; which bewitch all the Worldlings out of their Wits, &amp; the Saints too, in a great Mea&s;ure: It were more Wi&s;dom in us, <HI>to u&s;e the World, as not abu&s;ing it,</HI> as not &s;etting our Hearts upon it. Be|ware of the Cares of the World, and the Deceitfulne&s;s of Riches, wherewith you may be intangled, in the Condi|tion you are in; if you take not Heed, your Cour&s;e to Glory will be the more &s;low, and you will drive your Chariot-Wheels heavily up to the higher City; yea, the thick Clay will make them come back upon you. O con&s;ider how great a Bu&s;ine&s;s Salvation is! We can never con&s;ider it enough. You will think &s;o, when you come to Death, which you ought to look upon as at the Door.</P>
<P>I &s;peak not the&s;e Things, as if you knew them not al|ready; but I put you in Remembrance, de&s;iring to com|municate a little of my Mind to you, now, when I am at the Brink of Time; becau&s;e Providence hath &s;o ordered that we cannot &s;peak Face to Face the&s;e Things, which are the true and genuine Thoughts of my Heart. Beware of the Pollutions of the Times. It is comfortable to me
<PB N="270" REF="005510_0136_101849FEC411EE60">
that I had Little or Nothing to do, as to outward Things, with this horrid, cur&s;ed Defection. <HI>Hate the Garments &s;potted with the Fle&s;h</HI>: Clean Garments are of great Worth; and the&s;e few, in this woful Time, that have kept their Garments clean, <HI>&s;hall walk with our Lord in White; for they are worthy.</HI> To keep clean Garments, that is, to be pious alone; pious in your Fa|mily, in your Wor&s;hip; pious in your worldly Employ|ments; full of Charity, de&s;pi&s;ing the World; walking wi&s;ely towards the&s;e that are without, and towards the&s;e that are within. And as to the Times, let your Zeal be wi&s;e, and your Wi&s;dom zealous. You may believe a dying Man, I am fully per&s;waded that this Prelacy is abo|minable Antichri&s;tiani&s;m; and that the Prelates and Cu|rates are the Mini&s;ters, not of CHRIST, but of Antichri&s;t and Satan; and that it is utterly unlawful to hear them, or do any Thing, that may &s;hew you e&s;teem them Mi|ni&s;ters, or any Way &s;trengthen their Hands. O the dread|ful Wrath, that is hanging over the&s;e Lands like a Cloud, which will fall down in a Deluge of Divine Vengeance. God will make this Land to &s;wim in Blood; even the Blood of all Sorts, Great and Small, Rich and Poor, Old and Young, &s;hall be poured out like Du&s;t: He &s;hall be a &s;trange Man, that &s;hall happily e&s;cape &s;uch a Con|&s;umption. I will not &s;peak much of the Matter, but I &s;ee fearful Things coming. But, O the glorious Days &s;ucceeding the&s;e! I cannot apprehend the Glory that &s;hall &s;hine in <HI>Britain,</HI> which &s;hall enlighten to the Ends of the Earth. I fear not Death, 'tis Sin only we ought to fear; <HI>The Sting of Death is Sin</HI>; That being taken away, it is mo&s;t harmle&s;s. It is &s;weet to die in Chri&s;t! O what an Exchange do I make! I &s;hall &s;ee him, and that glorious Company of Saints and Angels, <HI>following Him whither&s;oever He goes</HI>: The fir&s;t Hour of Glory &s;hall, in a Manner, make me forget that ever I was upon Earth.

at the Haven of eternal Re&s;t. O 'tis &s;weet! O 'tis &s;weet! after a great-Toil and Labour. My Lord is ta|king me in the fitte&s;t Time; for both Body and Soul are very weary and &s;ore to&s;&s;ed: But this Body &s;hall get a &s;ound Sleep, and a ravi&s;hing Wakning. O the great Dif|ference betwixt what it is now, and what it &s;hall be &s;hort|ly! Who can conceive what Chri&s;t hath done for the Saints? O the Depth of free, altogether free Love and Grace! It &s;hall take up Eternity to cry up the in|conceivable Love of JEHOVAH and the LAMB. O to think that Bits of Clay, &s;inful Clay, like you and me &s;hould be conformed unto the Image of our only Lord Je&s;us! That is a wonderful Exaltation! wonderful in the Eyes of all the&s;e, that &s;ee their own Emptine&s;s and Vile|ne&s;s. O admire! O prai&s;e! O adore! Let the&s;e Things be &s;till imprinted on your Heart; all other Things are but Trifles. Look upon the World, as a Number of mad Bodies: They are Bea&s;ts, who&s;e Conceptions are con|fined within an Inch of Time: They are poor Spirits, who gape after Time's Riches, Honour and Plea&s;ures. If the World knew what they were doing, they would wonder at them&s;elves; at lea&s;t, they would begin to que|&s;tion, whether their Life on Earth was real, or only emp|ty, and a Night-dream. O &s;uch a Sight as I have gotten of the World! O 'tis but vain, Vanity of Vanities: The Flower and Choice of it is curs'd, and al|together Vanity. O if I could tell you of the Nothing|ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of the World, and of Things temporal; and of the Ma&s;&s;ine&s;s of Things eternal! Compare them together, and you will wonder at the Difference! The mo&s;t Part of Profe&s;&s;ors (among whom I put my &s;elf) take an ea&s;y Way to Heaven: And O where will you find the Man, or Woman, that &s;tudies a clo&s;e Walk with God! 'Tis recorded of <HI>Enoch,</HI> that <HI>He walked with God Three hundred Years</HI>: But who can &s;ay, He hath walked with God one Day? We lo&s;e God in the Mid&s;t of our worldly Employments, and cannot &s;ay, <HI>We have &s;et the

Lord always before us</HI>; Therefore, we cannot &s;ay, <HI>We &s;hall not be moved.</HI> We approach to Him, in the Mor|ning, Evening, and at other Times; but we neglect our Thoughts: Whereas to live full of holy divine Tho'ts, is to live a Saint: As the Man is, &s;o are his Thoughts. Alas! I may &s;ay it, by &s;ad Experience, Unwatched-over Tho'ts have made me, many a Time, not to dif|fer much from a Worldling. Keep your Thoughts right, and all &s;hall be right: <HI>Keep thine Heart with all Dili|gence</HI> (&s;aith the Spirit of God) <HI>for out of it are the I&s;&s;ues of Life.</HI> If your Thoughts be right, your Prayers will be &s;ea&s;onable, your Words and Actions will be &s;ea&s;o|nable, for, <HI>out of the Abundance of the Heart the Mouth &s;peaketh,</HI> and the Hand acteth. Commit all your Affairs, temporal, &s;piritual and eternal, wholly to your heavenly Father, without the lea&s;t Re&s;ervation: <HI>He cares for you</HI>; Therefore, <HI>be careful in nothing, but in every Thing give Thanks. Run, run with Patience, the Race that is &s;et be|fore you; Laying a&s;ide every Weight,</HI> that may bear you down: Intangle not your &s;elf with the World; have as little ado with it, as you can: <HI>The Righteous &s;hall &s;carcely be &s;aved</HI>; they, who go uprighte&s;t, &s;hall find hard enough Work: We are &s;o full of Corruptions ori|ginal and actual, that Holine&s;s is quite contrary to our corrupt Natures: I mean not the common Holine&s;s, which even tho&s;e, that are &s;trict, are thought to have; but that which our Lord commands; <HI>He that loveth Father or Mother, Si&s;ter or Brother, or the World, or him&s;elf bet|ter than me, is not worthy of me.</HI> O it is an unknown Thing, to <HI>deny all, to take up their Cro&s;s daily, and follow CHRIST.</HI> I had a great De&s;ire to preach CHRIST; But He will accept the Will for the Deed: I go to bet|ter Exerci&s;e, whereof one Hour is better than all the Prea|chings betwixt this, and Chri&s;t's &s;econd Coming, com|pendized in one. All here are but Shadows; all above is Sub&s;tance. O what elevated Divines are above! They are all filled with all the Fulne&s;s of God; &amp; do preach

and cry up the tran&s;cendent Excellencies of JEHOVAH and the LAMB: There is a perpetual Crying-up of Chri&s;t. In <HI>Canticles,</HI> He can never enough &s;peak of his Spou&s;e: Up above, his Spou&s;e can never enough &s;peak of Him. There all are ravi&s;hed with the Ancient of Days! Who, but the Ancient of Days? Who but CHRIST? Who, but the Saints? Then, let never Earth &amp; Heaven be compared together; for I tell you, Earth, is but a tormenting Hell, in Compari&s;on of that un&s;peakably de|lightful, and altogether ravi&s;hing Land, unto which un|worthy (but happy) I am going, O methinks, I am touching the Skirts of the fragrant Breathings of the Mountains of Spices! And O how I mu&s;t be ravi&s;hed, when I &s;hall draw in no other Air, but the Breathings of the higher Paradi&s;e?

<P>THough I be &s;tepping into Eternity, and was thought to have been ju&s;t entring into it about Half an Hour ago, I could not but remember you and
<PB N="274" REF="005510_0138_10184A0458479F38">
dictate a little of my Mind unto you: Not that I intend|ed to write any In&s;tructions unto you, but only &s;hew, That God is good to them that &s;eek him; and that in his Providence, his Promi&s;es are all accompli&s;hed to the Full, to me. I cannot tell what he hath done for my Soul; but I think, He hath brought me to the End of my Days, to the End of my Race, by &s;uch a wonderful Chain of divine Providence, that I would not, for Ten thou&s;and Worlds, He had brought me any other Way; or, that my Race had been either longer, or &s;horter. He liveth long enough, who liveth till he get Heaven: All other Things are but Pendicles. He liveth &s;hort While, who is unprepared for it; of what&s;oever Age he be: Therefore my Death needs not offend any Man; for, what can I get more, than the <HI>Kingdom immoveable, undefiled, and that fadeth not away</HI>? I de&s;ired to live, for no other End, but to preach my <HI>Lord to the great Congregation</HI>; And think you not, He will accept the <HI>Will</HI> for the <HI>Deed</HI>? I de|dicated my Life for his Service; and I hope, He will graciou&s;ly take it off my Hand, as if I had done him many Years Service. And I mu&s;t tell you, He hath many wonderful Ways of Bringing his Children unto Glory: I could tell you it by &s;weet Experience, if my Weakne&s;s and Breath would permit. I would not, for all the Glo|ry, Riches and Plea&s;ures of a vain World, my Lot had been another than my Lord hath appointed it; yea, my la&s;t Half-Year's Providence hath been a golden Chain, which neither I, Men, nor Angels can &s;ufficiently value. Would you know, what I think now of Heaven? Tho' I were out of this State of Mortality, I could never think of it enough! O! O! O! the Joy of being with JEHO|VAH and the LAMB! O the <HI>Excellency of the Know|ledge of Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> even on this Side of Time! But to &s;ee Him as he is, O who can tell what a Sight it is?

To &s;hew my great Love and Re&s;pect I have e|ver had to you, both formerly and now, I write unto you, even when the Dead-Rittle is in my Throat: And tho' I be in a great Agnoy, I find the only Way to Heaven, that <HI>New and Living Way,</HI> is only by the Blood of the Son of GOD: There is no other Way, but, <HI>Believe</HI> in Chri&s;t and be <HI>Saved.</HI> But it is a lively, purifying, loving and believing Way. I cannot &s;ay much, I am in Death's Pangs. But, <HI>O Death! where is thy Sting? O Grave! where is thy Victory?</HI> I am like to have a &s;harp Combat; but, I hope, Chri&s;t will not be an indifferent Spectator. The End crowns the Work. And if once I were within <HI>Emmanuel</HI>'s &s;urpa&s;&s;ing &s;weet Land of Conque&s;t, then &s;hould I trample Death and Hell under Foot; and tri|umph over all the Mi&s;eries and Afflictions of Time, which &s;eemed to triumph over me. O Death what art thou, in mine Eyes! My LORD hath &s;wallowed thee up in Victory: And can a free-born Son, and Con|queror, through the Blood of the everla&s;ting Covenant, be afraid of a conquered Slave? <HI>Rev.</HI> 14.13.
