<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<Q><HI>To love the LORD our GOD with all the Heart, and with all the Soul, and with all the Mind; is the fir&s;t and great Commandment.</HI></Q>
<P>I &s;hall &s;peak to this Doctrine under the following Particulars: I. What is this Love of God? II. We may further explain the Command by &s;hewing what is intended by loving God with all the Heart,<HI>&amp;c.</HI> III. I &s;hall &s;hew that this is the fir&s;t and great Com|mandment.</P>
<P N="1">I.<HI>What is this Love of GOD?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Love to GOD is a Grace of the Spirit, whereby we e&s;teem and de&s;ire him above all, and cleave to him as to our chief Good with holy Delight, from a &s;piritual Sight of his mo&s;t amiable Perfections, as manife&s;ted in his Word and Works, and in the Per|&s;on of our Lord JESUS CHRIST. Under this gene|ral De&s;cription I may &s;ay more particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. LOVE to GOD is a <HI>Grace of the Holy Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>LOVE, con&s;ider it as an Affection or Pa&s;&s;ion whereby the Soul uniteth with that which appears amiable, is natural to us, and in its own Nature good, being from GOD: The Object of this uniting Affec|tion is whatever is apprehended to be good for us. And as this Pa&s;&s;ion was in our fir&s;t Parents while they retained their Integrity, it had not only a phy&s;ical, but moral Goodne&s;s, being placed on GOD as the
<PB N="7" REF="005054_0005_101692108165AE68">
&s;upreme Good, and Fountain of all Happine&s;s; and upon the Creature in due Mea&s;ure, and in a regular Subordination. But when Sin entred, <HI>Adam</HI> lo&s;t that divine Impre&s;&s;ion which was on this Affection: He became an idolatrous Lover of him&s;elf, and of tho&s;e carnal Plea&s;ures whereby &s;inful Self is gratified. And now &s;ince the Fall, the Character of Men is that, <HI>Lovers of their own &s;elves. Lovers of Plea&s;ures more than Lovers of GOD,</HI> 2 Tim. 3.2,&mdash;4. And be|cau&s;e they can find no true Satisfaction, they dote on many Lovers. And as their Inclination is turned to|wards Creatures which gratify their Lu&s;ts; &s;o they have a dreadful Aver&s;ion to GOD and his holy Law, which &s;tand in Oppo&s;ition to them. They delight not them&s;elves in the Almighty. The Character of Men left to the Darkne&s;s and Corruption of their own Minds is that, Rom. 1.30. <HI>Haters of GOD.</HI> Yea, when JESUS the Light of the World appear'd, many even of his own People loved Darkne&s;s rather than Light, becau&s;e their Deeds were evil. <HI>Now have they both &s;een, and hated both me and my Father,</HI> Joh. 15.24. Accur&s;ed Malignity. Is it po&s;&s;ible? Yes, the <HI>carnal Mind is Enmity again&s;t GOD,</HI> Rom. 8.7. The Holine&s;s and Ju&s;tice of GOD appearing in the Commands and Sanction of his Law, are very dis|agreeable to the Sinner: The Pre&s;ence of GOD is offen&s;ive to him, he doth not like to retain GOD in his Knowledge; yea, he &s;ays to GOD, <HI>Depart from me, I de&s;ire not the Knowledge of thy Ways,</HI> Job 21.14. This is the vile and wretched State of Men un|til GOD renew them in the Spirit of their Minds, and &s;o write this Law of Love upon their Hearts by his holy Spirit. Gal. 5.22. <HI>The Fruit of the Spirit is
<PB N="8" REF="005054_0006_101692120C80BAB8">
Love.</HI> This is Part of the divine Image drawn on the Hearts of Men when the GOD of Love cometh to dwell in them by his Spirit: They love the Lord, and hate Evil. And when this holy Impre&s;&s;ion is made on the Will and Affections, the Sinner who was going away from the ble&s;&s;ed GOD, returns to him as his Re&s;t and Happine&s;s. Which leads me to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">2. HE that loveth GOD, <HI>e&s;teems and de&s;ires him above all.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Language of the Soul is that, <HI>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon Earth that I de&s;ire be&s;ides thee,</HI> P&s;al. 73.25. GOD is infinite Gdodne&s;s, and there's nothing good but as it deriveth from him. <HI>There is none good but one, that is GOD,</HI> Matth. 19.17. And therefore mu&s;t we e&s;teem him above all other Beings, or we do not truly love him; for his Name alone is excellent, his Glory is above the Earth and Heaven. GOD alone is the Object of our religious Devotion in this Re|&s;pect, and the De&s;ires of our Souls mu&s;t be to his Name above every Name. De&s;ire and Joy may be call'd different Modifications of Love, as the Object is con&s;ider'd to be ab&s;ent or pre&s;ent. Agreeably, when a Child of GOD, who is born from above, is made &s;en&s;ible of the infinite Amiablene&s;s of GOD, and of the great Di&s;tance at which Sin hath &s;et him from this glorious Object; he reacheth after GOD in fervent De&s;ires and Longings of Soul. The inward Breathings of GOD's People after him, are well ex|pre&s;s'd by the P&s;almi&s;t when driven from GOD's Hou&s;e and Ordinances into the Wilderne&s;s of <HI>Judah, O GOD, thou art my GOD, early will I &s;eek thee: my
<PB N="9" REF="005054_0007_1016921645202DF8">
Soul thir&s;teth for thee, my Fle&s;h longeth for thee,</HI> P&s;al. 63.1. Such are the De&s;ires of them that truly love GOD, and have this Love in a lively Exerci&s;e; and the&s;e De&s;ires give Wings to the Soul as it were, they mount up as Eagles towards Heaven. They a&s;pire after the perfect Enjoyment of the ble&s;&s;ed GOD, and can't be fully &s;atisfied till they are pre&s;ent with the LORD in Heaven, where is Fulne&s;s of Joys. The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> when in the lively Exerci&s;e of this Love, had <HI>a De&s;ire to depart,</HI> and be with CHRIST. And the longing De&s;ires of GOD's Peo|ple after the glorious Appearing of their GOD and Saviour, we have expre&s;s'd at the Clo&s;e of the Revela|tion, <HI>Even &s;o, come, LORD JESUS.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. IN the Exerci&s;e of this Love, <HI>GOD's People take Complacency in him as their chief Good, and cleave to him in holy Delight.</HI></P>
<P>THE Language of &s;uch as truly love GOD is that,<HI>Return unto thy Re&s;t, O my Soul, for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee,</HI> P&s;al. 116.7. They re&s;t in GOD as the only &s;atisfying Portion of their Souls, &s;aying as the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>Thou art my Portion, O LORD.</HI> Love is a uniting Affection, and it takes Plea&s;ure in the Enjoyment of the Object beloved, and rejoiceth when in the neare&s;t Union with it. Agree|ably, he that truly loveth GOD, obeys that Com|mand, <HI>Delight thy &s;elf in the LORD,</HI> P&s;al. 37.4. He delights in drawing nigh to GOD, and holding Communion with him. From his Heart he &s;ays, It is good for me to draw near to GOD; the nearer the better in his Account. He goes to GOD as to his exceeding great Joy, and when it plea&s;eth GOD to give him the evident Tokens of his gracious Pre&s;ence
<PB N="10" REF="005054_0008_1016921A5252A0C8">
and Favour, this is better to him than all Earthly Joy, than the Joy of Harve&s;t. <HI>There be many that &s;ay, Who will &s;hew us any good? LORD, lift thou up the Light of thy Countenance upon us. Thou ha&s;t put Gladne&s;s in my Heart, more than in the Time that their Corn and their Wine increa&s;ed,</HI> P&s;al. 4.6, 7. Such delight in all GOD's Attributes, in his Holine&s;s and Ju&s;tice, as well as in his Grace and Mercy; which appears in their earne&s;t De&s;ires and Endeavours to perfect Holine&s;s in the Fear of the LORD. They al&s;o delight in GOD's <HI>Law</HI> after the inner Man, be|cau&s;e it is the Will of GOD declared to them. They likewi&s;e rejoice in the Day which the LORD has made, and call the <HI>Sabbath</HI> their Delight; becau&s;e this Day is holy to the Lord, and the ble&s;&s;ed Sea&s;on for Communion with him. They love the Habita|tion of <HI>GOD's Hou&s;e,</HI> the Place where his Honour dwells. <HI>How amiable are thy Tabernacles, O LORD of Ho&s;ts!</HI> P&s;al. 84.1. However, they are not &s;ati&s;|fied with a bodily Attendance on Ordinances, when they do not find and enjoy GOD in them; but when GOD draweth nigh to their Souls in the Ways of his Appointment, they are &s;atisfied with the good things of his Hou&s;e as with Marrow and Fatne&s;s, and prai&s;e him with joyful Lips. In a Word, where there is this <HI>Love &s;hed abroad in the Heart by the Spirit,</HI> we choo&s;e GOD as our chief Good and highe&s;t End, and cleave to him with holy Satisfaction. Indeed, our Love in this Life will at be&s;t fall &s;hort of &s;inle&s;s Perfection, and the Exerci&s;e of it mu&s;t be more or le&s;s ob&s;tructed by remaining Corruption. Alas! the be&s;t of GOD's Children here find &s;ad Occa&s;ion to complain of the Coldne&s;s and Deadne&s;s of their Affec|tions,
<PB N="11" REF="005054_0009_1016921BDBED5678">
while engag'd in religious Duties. However when this Love is in a lively Exerci&s;e, there's holy Joy in the LORD: Now they can &s;ay, <HI>My Heart is fixed, O GOD, my Heart is fixed, I will &s;ing and give Prai&s;e:</HI> Unle&s;s when it plea&s;eth a wife and &s;ove|reign GOD to hide his Face, then they are troubled for want of the &s;en&s;ible Manife&s;tations of his gracious Pre&s;ence. And when this is the &s;orrowful Ca&s;e, their Love expre&s;&s;eth it &s;elf in an holy mourning after God, <HI>Mine Eye runneth down with Water, becau&s;e the Comforter that &s;hould relieve my Soul, is far from me,</HI> Lam. 1.16.</P>
<P N="4">4. THIS Love to GOD <HI>is drawn forth by a be|lieving View of GOD, his mo&s;t amiable Perfections and Attributes, as the&s;e are manife&s;ted in his Works, his Word, and the Per&s;on of our Lord JESUS CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is no De&s;ire of, or Love to that which is unknown. We mu&s;t therefore be renewed after the Image of GOD in Knowledge, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Holine&s;s: And as there mu&s;t be a Likene&s;s to GOD in his imitable Perfections inwrought into the Soul as a Principle of Union, without this the mo&s;t excellent and glorious Being cannot be agreeable and plea&s;ing to us; &s;o there mu&s;t be a &s;piritual Sight of this glori|ous Object to draw forth the actings of Love. <HI>Faith,</HI> which is the Evidence of Things not &s;een, <HI>worketh by Love,</HI> Gal. 5.6. When the Eyes of the Under|&s;tanding are enlightned, and we can &s;ay, Mine Eye &s;eeth thee; we &s;hall not only abhor our &s;elves for our mo&s;t unnatural Rebellion again&s;t our heavenly Father, but al&s;o return to our Duty in filial Love. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> by Faith &s;aw him who is invi&s;ible, and then refus'd to be call'd the Son of <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Daughter; <HI>E&s;teeming
<PB N="12" REF="005054_0010_1016921E79205038">
the Reproach of CHRIST greater Riches than the Trea|&s;ures of Egypt.</HI> Agreeably the Apo&s;tle prays for the Chri&s;tian
<HI>Philippians,</HI> as Chap. 1.9, 10. <HI>And this I pray, that your Love may abound yet more and more in Knowledge, and in all Judgment; that ye may approve Things that are excellent.</HI> He that truly loveth GOD hath a &s;aving Di&s;covery of his infinite Excellency, a believing Sight of his Glory as revealed in his Word and Works, and in the Per&s;on of our Lord JESUS CHRIST. The Heathen had &s;ome general Notions of GOD's Perfections, tho&s;e of them which are made known in the Works of Creation and common Provi|dence; and accordingly they &s;tiled their <HI>Jupiter</HI> the be&s;t and the greate&s;t. But alas! notwith&s;tanding this, <HI>when they knew GOD, they glorified him not as GOD, neither were thankful, but became vain in their Imagina|tions, and their fooli&s;h Heart was darkned. And changed the Glory of the uncorruptible GOD, into an Image made like to corruptible Man, and to Birds, and four-footed Bea&s;ts, and creeping Things,</HI> Rom. 1.21,&mdash;23. The Light of Nature is not &s;ufficient to direct our Hearts into the Love of GOD. We mu&s;t by Faith receive the Witne&s;s which GOD's Works together with his Word give concerning him, or our Hearts will ne|ver be drawn forth towards him in this holy Love. <HI>Through Faith we under&s;tand that the Worlds were framed by the Word of GOD, &s;o that Things which are &s;een were not made of Things which do appear,</HI> Heb. 11.3. There was no pre-exi&s;tent Matter when GOD began to create the World; but all Things were made of Nothing by the Word of GOD's Power. Accordingly, when the Believer lifts up his Eyes to the Heavens which declare the Glory of GOD, or
<PB N="13" REF="005054_0011_101692201ECB2208">
looks to the Earth which is full of his Goodne&s;s; he admiring &s;ays, <HI>How excellent is thy Name in all the Earth! Thy Glory is above the Heavens.</HI> But GOD hath magnified his Word above all his Name upon the Account of the Di&s;coveries which he has been plea&s;ed herein to make of him&s;elf, and the only Way of Salvation by a Redeemer. The Way of the Sin|ner's Recovery by CHRIST could not be known 'till it plea&s;ed GOD to reveal it. In this Revelation GOD pa&s;&s;eth before us, and proclaims, <HI>The LORD, The LORD GOD, merciful and gracious, long-&s;uffering, and abundant in Goodne&s;s and Truth, keeping Mercy for Thou&s;ands, forgiving Iniquity, and Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and Sin,</HI> Exod. 34.6, 7. Herein GOD gives the Light of the Knowledge of him&s;elf in the Per&s;on of CHRIST, who is the <HI>Brightne&s;s of the Father's Glory.</HI> Here the Perfections of GOD, which are infinitely excel|lent, appear mo&s;t amiable unto us, when we behold them in CHRIST God-Man Mediator, con&s;piring to promote the Salvation of lo&s;t, mi&s;erable Man. And now the Believer, adoring &s;ays, How great is his Goodne&s;s! How great is his Beauty! It was the Say|ing of <HI>One, I would not have an ab&s;olute GOD,</HI> that is, a GOD out of CHRIST. Out of CHRIST GOD is a con&s;uming Fire to Sinners; and if we thus con|&s;ider him, we may well fly from him with that de|&s;pairing Cry, <HI>Who among us &s;hall dwell with the de|vouring Fire? Who among us &s;hall dwell with everla&s;t|ing Burnings?</HI> Accordingly, our <HI>fir&s;t Parents,</HI> when they had lo&s;t GOD's Image, and expos'd them&s;elves to his Wrath and Cur&s;e by their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, hid them&s;elves from the Pre&s;ence of the LORD, afraid to &s;ee his Face as a righteous Judge and Avenger of
<PB N="14" REF="005054_0012_1016922327EC2F30">
Sin. But now in CHRIST we behold GOD recon|ciling Sinners to him&s;elf, and may &s;ay with the Apo|&s;tle <HI>John, GOD is Love.</HI> What higher Te&s;timony could be given than this, the Father's &s;o loving us as to give his Son to take our Nature, and die for us? The Believer feels the Power of it con&s;training him to love GOD with mutual Affection. And &s;till the Love of GOD is further &s;hed abroad in his Heart, when he can with the A&s;&s;urance of Faith &s;ay concern|ing his GOD and Saviour, <HI>He has loved me, and given him&s;elf for me.</HI> Propriety in any de&s;ireable Object, much more in One infinitely worthy our highe&s;t Love, is very endearing. How tran&s;porting mu&s;t it be to &s;ay, <HI>He is altogether lovely;</HI> This is <HI>my Beloved,</HI> and this is my Friend? Surely &s;uch an one mu&s;t be con&s;train'd to &s;ay with <HI>Peter,</HI> Lord, thou knowe&s;t all Things, <HI>Thou knowe&s;t that I love thee.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. I &s;hall endeavour further to explain this Duty, by con&s;idering <HI>what is intended in loving GOD with all the Heart, with all the Soul, and with all the Mind.</HI></P>
<P>BEFORE I &s;peak particularly to this Head, I would ob&s;erve to you, that this Duty of Love is here &s;o fully expre&s;s'd, that our Love to GOD mu&s;t be com|pleated in &s;inle&s;s Perfection, before we can keep this great Command according to the full Extent of the&s;e Words. While we are in this imperfect State, there will be &s;ome &s;inful Defect in our Love to GOD, and &s;ome criminal Exce&s;s in our Love to the Creature. However in a qualified Sen&s;e, as Sincerity is called Perfection, every one that loveth GOD truly, may be &s;aid to love him with all the Heart,&mdash; By <HI>Heart</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="005054_0013_10169226E5E8E138">
as here u&s;ed, &s;ome under&s;tand the <HI>Will:</HI> We mu&s;t choo&s;e GOD with our whole Heart. By <HI>Soul,</HI> &s;ome under&s;tand the <HI>Affection.</HI> By <HI>Mind,</HI> the <HI>Under&s;tand|ing,</HI> which is the leading Faculty. In <HI>Mark</HI> we read, <HI>with all the Under&s;tanding,</HI> as the Command is re|peated, ch. 12. v. 33. In <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> where this Command is mentioned, <HI>Mind</HI> is omitted, and <HI>Might</HI> is added. In <HI>Mark, with all thy Strength</HI> is added, ch. 12. v. 30. But we need not be critical in exa|mining the particular Sen&s;e of each Expre&s;&s;ion; take them together, they may imply &s;uch Things as the&s;e following.</P>
<P N="1">1. WE mu&s;t love GOD <HI>with Sincerity, in Oppo&s;i|tion to hypocritical Pretences. My little Children, let us not love in Word, neither in Tongue, but in Deed and in Truth,</HI> 1 Joh. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> 18.</P>
<P>OUR Love to GOD mu&s;t be hearty, and in this Re&s;pect we mu&s;t wor&s;hip him in Spirit and in Truth. Behold, <HI>thou de&s;ire&s;t Truth in the inward Parts,</HI> P&s;al. 5<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> The inward Motions and Affections of the Heart mu&s;t agree with our outward Expre&s;&s;ions of Love. We mu&s;t take heed we be not like them, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 33.31. <HI>They come unto thee as the People co|meth, and they &s;it before thee as my People, and they bear thy Words, but they will not do them: For with their Mouth they &s;hew much Love, but their Heart go|eth after their Covetou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> GOD &s;earcheth, and re|quireth the Heart. <HI>My Son, give me thine Heart,</HI> Prov. 23.26. And we highly di&s;honour and pro|voke him, if we lie to the Lord in our outward Pro|fe&s;&s;ion; and we may depend upon it the holy GOD will reject us with Abhorrence, and give us our Por|tion with Hypocrites, except we repent. <HI>The End of
<PB N="16" REF="005054_0014_1016922B08133708">
the Commandment is Charity, out of a pure Heart, and of a good Con&s;cience, and of Faith unfeigned,</HI> 1 Tim. 1.5.</P>
<P N="2">2. THERE mu&s;t be <HI>Integrity, in Oppo&s;ition to a divided Heart.</HI></P>
<P>WE mu&s;t take Care we be not of double Heart. There mu&s;t not be an Heart for GOD, and an Heart for the World too; for our Saviour a&s;&s;ureth us, <HI>No Man can &s;erve two Ma&s;ters: For either he will hate the one, and love the other; or el&s;e he will hold to the one, and de&s;pi&s;e the other. Ye cannot &s;erve GOD and Mammon,</HI> Matth. 6.24. We mu&s;t choo&s;e and love GOD with a perfect Heart; we mu&s;t cleave to him wholly, and have our Hearts united in his Love, as well as in his Fear. We mu&s;t give the LORD our whole Souls, and not willingly withhold any Thing from him. Every Power mu&s;t be devoted to GOD's Service, and the Dominion of every Lu&s;t taken away. We mu&s;t have Re&s;pect to all GOD's Com|mandments from Love to him, and hate every fal&s;e Way. If there be any <HI>Idol</HI> retain'd, the Love of GOD doth not reign in us. <HI>Their Heart is divided; now &s;hall they be found faulty,</HI> Ho&s;. 10.2. The in|finitely glorious Jehovah will bear no Rival.</P>
<P N="3">3. OUR Love to GOD <HI>mu&s;t exceed all our other Love.</HI></P>
<P>WE mu&s;t e&s;teem him mo&s;t excellent, and our Love to him mu&s;t be &s;uperlative. <HI>If any Man come to me, and hate not his Father, and Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Brethren, and Si&s;ters, yea, and his own Life al&s;o, he cannot be my Di&s;ciple,</HI> Luk. 14.26. Not as if Chri&s;tians might be without natural Affec|tion. By no means; but then &s;o far as our neare&s;t
<PB N="17" REF="005054_0015_1016922CA4E35FE8">
and deare&s;t Enjoyments would tempt us to turn from the ble&s;&s;ed GOD; &s;o far mu&s;t we treat them as evil, and not count our very Lives dear when they &s;tand in Competition with the Glory and Enjoyment of GOD. Unle&s;s we love GOD above the Creature, and are in &s;ome true Mea&s;ure willing to for&s;ake all for him; our Love is not genuine. All the Good|ne&s;s of the Creature compar'd with the Goodne&s;s of GOD, is not &s;o much as a Spark to the Sun, or a Drop to the Ocean. <HI>Finite</HI> bears no Proportion to <HI>Infinite.</HI> Accordingly our Love to GOD mu&s;t excel. We ought to love nothing but in Subordination to GOD; for his &s;ake, and according to the Rule and Mea&s;ure of his Will declared in his Word. The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;uffered the Lo&s;s of all Things, and <HI>counted them but Dung that he might win CHRIST.</HI> However, this doth not &s;uppo&s;e that every true Chri|&s;tian is in a next Preparation to &s;uffer Martyrdom for JESUS CHRIST. There may be a willing Mind, and &s;ome true Mea&s;ure of Love, where there is not pre&s;ent Courage and Re&s;olution thus to &s;uffer for CHRIST. <HI>The Spirit indeed is willing, but the Fle&s;h is weak,</HI> Matth. 26.41. But then, GOD's People may not &s;atisfy them&s;elves with the lowe&s;t Degree of that Love which is true for kind. No! They mu&s;t la|bour to grow in this Grace, and &s;o to be going on towards Perfection.</P>
<P N="4">4. WE mu&s;t love GOD <HI>with the Strength of our Hearts; with a &s;trong and ardent Love, in Oppo&s;ition to that which is languid and weak.</HI></P>
<P>WE mu&s;t labour after that Love which is &s;tronger than Death, and burns like the Fire which hath a mo&s;t vehement Flame. Our Love to GOD &s;hould
<PB N="18" REF="005054_0016_1016922F4CD4BAA0">
be inten&s;e and active. In this Re&s;pect we &s;hould en|deavour to re&s;emble the holy <HI>Angels,</HI> who are as <HI>Flames of Fire</HI> for the Fervour and Activity of their Love; and are accordingly called <HI>Seraphim,</HI> burners I&s;a. 6.2. We mu&s;t burn in Love to GOD, and holy Zeal again&s;t Sin; &s;o as to be not &s;lothful in his Bu&s;ine&s;s, fervent in Spirit &s;erving the LORD; doing, his Will on Earth in &s;ome Mea&s;ure as the Angels do it in Heaven.</P>
<P N="5">5. OUR Love to GOD mu&s;t be <HI>intelligent.</HI></P>
<P>WE mu&s;t have right Thoughts and &s;piritual Ap|prehen&s;ions of GOD leading and directing the other Faculties. It mu&s;t be with the Under&s;tanding. We mu&s;t frequently think of GOD, and our Meditation of him &s;hould be &s;weet unto us. One Character of the Wicked is that, <HI>GOD is not in all their Thoughts,</HI> P&s;al. 10.4. We &s;hould then mu&s;e till the Fire burn, and often warm our Hearts with &s;erious Tho'ts of the ble&s;&s;ed GOD, his glorious Perfections, and wonderful Works. When the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> had been me|ditating of the Goodne&s;s of the LORD in his won|derful Works to the Children of Men, he clo&s;eth the P&s;alm with the&s;e Words, <HI>Who&s;o is wi&s;e, and will ob|&s;erve tho&s;e Things, even they &s;hall under&s;tand the loving kindne&s;s of the LORD,</HI> P&s;al. 107.43. The more we &s;ee of the Creature, the more we &s;ee its Vanity and Emptine&s;s; but the more we follow on to know the LORD, the more &s;hall we &s;ee of his divine Ex|cellency and Glory to increa&s;e our E&s;teem and Love. But I forbear, and &s;hall only further &s;ay in a Word: We &s;hould with all the Powers of Soul and Body ex|pre&s;s our Love to GOD, devoting our &s;elves wholly to him, employing all our Abilities in his Service,
<PB N="19" REF="005054_0017_1016923206259008">
and doing his Commandments with all our Might. I can't di&s;mi&s;s this &s;econd Head without this Reflecti|on, How far &s;hort do we fall of our Duty! Surely this Commandment is exceeding broad. Which brings me to the third and la&s;t Head.</P>
<P N="3">III. WHICH is to &s;hew, that <HI>This is the fir&s;t and great Commandment.</HI></P>
<P>THAT this is GOD's Command, is plain from the Old and New Te&s;tament. <HI>Hear, O l&s;rael, The LORD our GOD is one LORD. And thou &s;halt love the LORD thy GOD with all thine Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Might,</HI> Deut. 6.5, 6. But it would be to light a Candle in the Sun, to go about to prove that this is GOD's Commandment. We therefore proceed to &s;hew that it de&s;erveth the Character here given; the fir&s;t and great Commandment.</P>
<P>THE Love of GOD is the <HI>fir&s;t Commandment</HI> in Order and Dignity. In Order of Nature, &s;ays a worthy Divine, becau&s;e the Love of our Neighbour flows from our Love of GOD: And al&s;o in Dignity, &s;ays another, becau&s;e it commands us Things con|cerning GOD. And the <HI>great Command.</HI> That is, &s;ays BEZA, "The greate&s;t of All; for otherwi&s;e, as he al&s;o ob&s;erveth, there is nothing &s;mall which GOD commands." Here to confirm and illu&s;trate this la&s;t Head, I would &s;ay more particularly.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE Love of GOD may fitly be called the fir&s;t and great Command <HI>with re&s;pect to the Object of it, the infinitely great and good GOD, the fir&s;t Cau&s;e, and la&s;t End of all Things.</HI></P>
<P>BEHOLD, GOD is great. <HI>Behold, the Nations are as Drop of a Bucket, and are counted as the &s;mall
<PB N="20" REF="005054_0018_10169234AEE71098">
Du&s;t of the Balance: Behold, he taketh up the I&s;les as a very little thing. All Nations before him are as No|thing, and they are counted to him le&s;s than Nothing, and Vanity,</HI> I&s;a. 40.15,&mdash;17. A few Years pa&s;t, &s;o may we &s;peak when meditating on the Eternal GOD, there was no Creature exi&s;ting; only this &s;elf-exi&s;tent, &s;elf-&s;ufficient Being, who&s;e Name is JEHO|VAH, from Everla&s;ting to Everla&s;ting. And now let the <HI>Univer&s;e</HI> &s;tand in Compari&s;on with Him, and it &s;hrinks into Nothing before Him, the infinite GOD. But we are Babes: Let the Angels then declare how great and good the LORD is. Behold, They al&s;o &s;tand amazed in awful Silence before him, covering their Faces. The Tongues of Angels fail, and our mo&s;t enlarged Thoughts are &s;wallowed up. How great then is this Command objectively con&s;idered. Surely it challengeth the fir&s;t and chief Place.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS will further appear if we con&s;ider <HI>the Relations which GOD bears to his People.</HI></P>
<P>THAT GOD, who is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t; is the Creator, Redeemer and Sancti|fier of his People. He is the Father of our Spirits, and Former of our Bodies. We were nothing 'till GOD gave us our Being, and that this excellent Be|ing; and when we were wor&s;e than Nothing by our Apo&s;tacy from GOD, it plea&s;ed the Father of Glory to fond his Son to redeem us. When GOD deliver'd the <HI>Ten Commandments</HI> to his ancient People, we have that Preface to them, <HI>I am the LORD thy GOD, which have brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, out of the Hou&s;e of Bondage,</HI> Exod. 20.2. This was in|deed a &s;trong Obligation upon them to love GOD, and keep his Commandments; but it is as nothing if
<PB N="21" REF="005054_0019_1016923831A774D0">
compar'd with GOD's &s;ending his Son to take our Nature, and give his Life a Ran&s;om for us; and then with his &s;ending the Holy Spirit to apply the Benefit of this Eternal Redemption to us. What are our natural Parents, or &s;piritual Fathers in CHRIST, but In&s;truments of conveying to us the Goodne&s;s of GOD? Surely then the Love of GOD mu&s;t &s;tand as the fir&s;t and chief Commandment.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE Love of GOD is the fir&s;t and great Com|mandment, <HI>as it comprehends the Sum of the four fir&s;t Commandments.</HI></P>
<P>WE commonly call the&s;e the <HI>fir&s;t Table;</HI> tho' we do not certainly know how many Commandments were written on the fir&s;t, and how many on the &s;e|cond of the two Tables delivered to <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> by GOD. However, it is plain the&s;e &s;tand foremo&s;t as they con|cern our Duty to GOD. And the&s;e great Matters of GOD's Law are all &s;um'd up in this comprehen|&s;ive Command, <HI>Thou &s;halt love the LORD thy GOD with all thy Heart.</HI> Doth GOD require us to &s;erve him only; with religious Wor&s;hip, and that in the Ways of his own Appointment? Doth he require us to wor&s;hip him with Reverence and godly Fear, and to beware of taking his Name in vain? Doth he re|quire us to &s;anctify his Day by &s;eparating our &s;elves from worldly Cares and Bu&s;ine&s;s, and Plea&s;ures; and by devoting that holy Time to religious Exerci&s;es? In the&s;e Commands GOD has written to us the great Things of his Law, and all is comprehended in this <HI>of Love.</HI> Well then may it be call'd the fir&s;t and great Commandment.</P>
<P N="4">4. THIS is in a Sen&s;e, <HI>the End and Perfection of other Commandments.</HI> This may be &s;aid of Love in
<PB N="22" REF="005054_0020_1016923BEFB1F218">
general, and in an e&s;pecial Manner of this Love of GOD. <HI>The End of the Commandment is Charity,</HI> 1 Tim. 1.5. This is what GOD de&s;igns in the Du|ties he requireth of us, even to perfect his Love in us. And this is what we ought very much to aim at in our Attendance on religious Duties, the Exerci&s;e and increa&s;e of Love. This is one great End of the In|&s;titution of the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try, that the Body of CHRIST, his Church may be <HI>edified in Love.</HI> The mo&s;t excellent Gifts without this, are as nothing in GOD's Account, and the mo&s;t co&s;tly Performances, the giving our Goods to feed the Poor, and our Bo|dies to be burned, profit not without this Love, which is very much the animating Life and Soul of true Obedience, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.1, 2. But where there is true Love to GOD in Exerci&s;e, a willing Mind is accepted according to what a Man hath, and the giving a Cup of cold Water &s;hall not lo&s;e its Reward.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>This Love &s;hall never fail.</HI> 1 Cor. 13.8. And upon this Account e&s;pecially Love is &s;aid to be grea|ter than Faith and Hope. 13 v. <HI>And now abideth Faith, Hope, Charity, the&s;e three; but the greate&s;t of the&s;e is Charity.</HI> Not as if Faith and Hope would ab&s;olutely fail, and cea&s;e as to their Exi&s;tence. We are requir'd to <HI>tru&s;t in the LORD for ever.</HI> But then Faith and Hope, tho&s;e excellent Graces, may be &s;aid to fail re&s;pecting &s;ome principal Office or Exerci&s;e in which they are of eminent U&s;efulne&s;s in the pre&s;ent Life; <HI>Faith,</HI> as it is the Evidence of Things not &s;een, will cea&s;e, when we &s;hall walk by <HI>Sight.</HI> Faith, as it is a <HI>Shield</HI> to defend us from the fiery Darts of the Wicked, &s;hall not be u&s;ed, when our Warfare is ac|compli&s;hed. We are now commanded, <HI>above all to
<PB N="23" REF="005054_0021_1016923D7AD6E1A8">
take the Shield of Faith.</HI> But there will be no further Need of it or U&s;e for it under this Character, when the Believer &s;hall triumph for ever in Heaven; for the <HI>old Serpent</HI> can't enter the <HI>heavenly Paradi&s;e</HI> to tempt GOD's People. But now when Faith &s;hall as it were be &s;wallowed up in the open Vi&s;ion of GOD, and Hope in the full Enjoyment of him; then &s;hall Love, be perfected for ever re&s;pecting its highe&s;t Of|fice. Then there will be the highe&s;t Exerci&s;e of Love in Delight and Joy. The Man&s;ions of Glory are the happy Places in which Knowledge and Love are for ever compleated; and yet, the Object being infinite, I can't &s;ee why they may not continue to grow and increa&s;e to all Eternity. O divine Life! To have the highe&s;t Actings of Love on an infinitely glorious Object mo&s;t intimately pre&s;ent, and mo&s;t fully manife&s;ting his Love to us. O Joy un&s;peaka|ble, and full of Glory! Surely our perfect Confor|mity to GOD's Will in this great Matter of his Law, is our highe&s;t Perfection and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. In keeping this Commandment there's <HI>a great Reward.</HI> When the glorified Saint loveth the LORD with all his Heart, and Mind, and Strength; he reacheth the Cen|tre of all true De&s;ire and Perfection, and finds Re&s;t in the full Enjoyment of GOD to all Eternity.</P>
<P>AND thus have I con&s;idered a few Things to &s;hew the greatne&s;s of this Command; I now proceed to the</P>

<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>U&s;e</HI> 1. We may learn from what hath been &s;aid, that <HI>the Law of the LORD is perfect, and mo&s;t excel|lent.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="005054_0022_101692403ACEF650">THUS we read, <HI>The Law of the LORD is perfect,</HI> P&s;al. 19.7. It extends to the Heart and Con&s;cience, and requireth the Obedience both of the inward and outward Man. Well might the P&s;almi&s;t &s;ay, <HI>I have &s;een an End of all Perfection; but thy Commandment is exceeding broad,</HI> P&s;al. 119.96. Divine and mo&s;t ex|cellent are its Commands, and it is the whole of Man to be obedient to them. It is al&s;o the Law of Love. Let us then &s;ay, <HI>O how love I thy Law!</HI> it is my Meditation all the Day. We &s;hould highly e&s;teem the Law as a perfect Rule of Duty; but not pre|&s;ume to depend upon it for Ju&s;tification. No, it is weak through the Fle&s;h, by Rea&s;on of our Sin; and can't give Life. It is indeed perfect in it&s;elf, and Salvation had been by the Law, if we had kept it; but as it is now a Law broken by us, it can't give us Life; for it is written, <HI>Cur&s;ed is every one that continueth not in all Things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them,</HI> Gal. 3.10. We may conclude then, that by the Deeds of the Law &s;hall no Fle&s;h living be ju&s;tified in the Sight of GOD. Dare any pre&s;ume to &s;tand a Trial according to the Law as a Covenant of Works? Vain Man! Thou daily breake&s;t GOD's Law in Thought, Word and Deed. Let us then humbly plead, <HI>Enter not into Judgment with thy Servants,</HI> for in thy Sight &s;hall no Fle&s;h living be ju&s;tified. And let the Law be as a School-Ma&s;ter to lead us to CHRIST, and teach us our Need of Him, who is the End of the Law for Righteou&s;|ne&s;s. His Love and Obedience were every Way perfect, and equal to this great Command. But alas! our's are very imperfect at be&s;t. How much are our Affections di&s;temper'd? How often do we feel a
<PB N="25" REF="005054_0023_1016924408E26A00">
feveri&s;h Heat of carnal Concupi&s;cence working in us &s;o that when we go to offer GOD our Hearts, we are lame and defective. Surely we can't be accepted but in the <HI>Beloved.</HI> The Sins cleaving to our very be&s;t Duties need Pardon, and clean&s;ing in the Blood of JESUS. Let each one of us then &s;ay; <HI>I count all Things but Lo&s;s, for the Excellency of the Knowledge of CHRIST JESUS my LORD: for whom I have &s;uf|fered the Lo&s;s of all Things, and do count them but Dung that I may win CHRIST, and be found in him, not having mine own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of CHRIST, the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of GOD by Faith,</HI> Phil. 3.8, 9.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Here we &s;ee how to judge of our Duties, and reli|gious Performances.</HI></P>
<P>WE come before GOD as his People; hear his Word, and do many Things. But can we &s;ay, that true Love to GOD is the inward Spring and active Principle from which the&s;e religious Actions proceed? Do we attend on GOD's Wor&s;hip from an hearty De&s;ire of Communion with him? <HI>Do we as new born Babes de&s;ire the &s;incere Milk of the Word,</HI> that we may grow thereby? And do we receive the Truth in the Love of it, as tho&s;e that are de&s;irous to prove what is that good, and perfect, and acceptable Will of GOD? And then, Do we in <HI>Prayer</HI> offer up our &s;incere De|&s;ires to GOD, as the true Seed of <HI>Jacob,</HI> who cannot bear to go away without his Ble&s;&s;ing? Is this our great Petition, <HI>Lord, lift thou up the Light of thy Counte|nance upon us?</HI> When we &s;it at the <HI>Lord's Table,</HI> Do we renumber CHRIST's Love more than Wine, and yield our &s;elves to him according to the new Cove|nant,
<PB N="26" REF="005054_0024_10169246AB82C370">
as tho&s;e who are not our own, being bought with the Price of his mo&s;t precious Blood? In a Word, Is the remaining Deadne&s;s and Coldne&s;s of Affection in Duty our heavy Burden? This true God|line&s;s is profitable to all Things; but bodily Exerci&s;e without it will profit little. And unle&s;s this holy Fire of Love be enkindled in our Hearts, we &s;hall not offer to GOD &s;piritual Sacrifices acceptable through CHRIST; but may expect that GOD will reject us and our Services, tho' we &s;hould often appear before him as his People.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Learn the great Sin, and Evil of living in Enmity again&s;t GOD.</HI></P>
<P>To love the LORD our GOD with all the Heart, we have heard, is the fir&s;t and great Command. Cer|tainly then &s;uch are great Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, who under the clear Revelation of GOD's Word, are Lovers of Plea&s;ures more than Lovers of GOD; who love the World, and the Things of the World above GOD. This mu&s;t be an heinous Violation of GOD's Law, and highly provoking to him who is a jealous GOD, <HI>vi&s;iting the Iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children of them that hate him.</HI> How often have &s;uch appeared to be the abhorred of the LORD, and their Po&s;terity following their Steps? <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 49.11,&mdash;13. But it may be &s;ome imagine they love GOD, and the World too. But O Self-deceiver! Hear the Word of the LORD, <HI>Love not the World, neither the Things that are in the World. If any Man love the World, the Love of the Father is not in him,</HI> 1 Joh. 2.15. The idolatrous Love we are now &s;peaking of, is utterly
<PB N="27" REF="005054_0025_1016924833A8F1F0">
incon&s;i&s;tent with the true Love of GOD; and where it governs, the Heart is full of Enmity again&s;t GOD. <HI>The Friend&s;hip of the World is Enmity with GOD: Who&s;oever therefore will be a Friend of the World, is the Enemy of GOD,</HI> Jam. 4.4. Now how great a Sin mu&s;t this be to continue in Enmity again&s;t the infinitely good GOD, our Maker, Pre&s;erver and great Benefactor; again&s;t this GOD, who has manife&s;ted his Love beyond our highe&s;t Conceptions, in &s;ending his Son to &s;ave a peri&s;hing World; and &s;ends his Mini&s;ters to be&s;eech us in his Name to be reconciled to him. O the vile Nature and great Aggravation of this Sin, which virtually contains Di&s;obedience to the whole Law and Go&s;pel too, and by both &s;tands condemned as exceeding &s;inful. Surely it is an Evil full of deadly Poy&s;on, no le&s;s de&s;tructive to us than it is offen&s;ive to GOD. They that are far from GOD mu&s;t peri&s;h. <HI>My Soul lothed them, and their Soul al&s;o abhorred me,</HI> Zech. 11.8. If you continue in this Di&s;tance and Alienation from GOD, you mu&s;t de|part accur&s;ed from him for ever into everla&s;ting Fire. Nothing remains for you, but that fiery Indignation which &s;hall devour the Adver&s;aries. GOD was ma|nife&s;t in the Fle&s;h, and revealed in <HI>Flames of Love</HI> to &s;ave Sinners, of Love &s;tronger than Death. What Malignity then mu&s;t there be in the Hearts of them that de&s;pi&s;e him, and neglect &s;o great Salvation? And how &s;hall they e&s;cape, when he &s;hall be revealed in <HI>flaming Fire, taking Vengeance on them that obey not his Go&s;pel.</HI> You may read your Doom, <HI>If any Man love not the Lord JESUS CHRIST, let him be Anathe|ma, Maran-atha,</HI> 1 Cor. 16.22. When our LORD cometh again, you will fall under his mo&s;t dreadful

Cur&s;e, and his Wrath &s;hall abide upon you for ever.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Let us examine our &s;elves whether we truly love GOD.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is the fir&s;t and great Commandment, and therefore it mu&s;t be a Matter of the greate&s;t Impor|tance that we yield Obedience to it. Let us then &s;e|riou&s;ly enquire; Is our Love to GOD hearty? Is it &s;uperlative? Do we chu&s;e him as our Portion, and de&s;ire none in Heaven or Earth, in Compari&s;on with him? Do we truly give him our Hearts, mourning becau&s;e we do it no better? Do we &s;incerely reach after the neare&s;t Union, and greate&s;t Conformity to GOD? Do we make it our Study and Care to plea&s;e GOD by keeping his Commandments? <HI>Joh.</HI> 14.15. <HI>If ye love me, keep my Commandments.</HI> Are we afraid of GOD's Di&s;plea&s;ure; and do we hate Sin with an irreconcilable Hatred? <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 97.10. <HI>Ye that love the LORD, hate Evil.</HI> Again, Are we much concerned for GOD's Glory in the World? Do we rejoice when his Name is hallowed, and mourn when it is profaned? Do the Intere&s;ts of CHRIST's Kingdom lie near our Hearts, and are we glad when the&s;e pro&s;per and flouri&s;h? This is a genuine Fruit of Love, to regard the Intere&s;ts of the Per&s;on beloved &s;omething as if they were our own. In a Word, Do we &s;incerely love the Children of GOD, and that becau&s;e they bear his Image? 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 4.20. <HI>If a Man &s;ay, I love GOD, and hateth his Brother, he is a Liar: For he that loveth not his Brother whom he hath &s;een, how can he love GOD whom he hath not &s;een?</HI></P>
<P N="5"><PB N="29" REF="005054_0027_1016924CD305A4E8">5. <HI>Let us all be exhorted to love GOD, and that with all our Hearts.</HI></P>
<P>THE Goodne&s;s of GOD was in a di&s;tingui&s;hing Manner manife&s;ted to Man in his fir&s;t Creation, in that the <HI>Father of Spirits</HI> formed him with a <HI>rea&s;onable Soul,</HI> capable of knowing and enjoying him for ever; and made him <HI>in his Image,</HI> and after his Likene&s;s. It is our Sin and Mi&s;ery, that by the Fall we are alie|nated from GOD, and Enemies in our Minds. Cer|tainly then it mu&s;t be our great Duty and Intere&s;t to return to the LORD our GOD who hath made us, and who alone can make us happy. Let us then cry to GOD for his holy Spirit, to de&s;troy this accur&s;ed Enmity; and to reconcile us to GOD by the Blood of CHRIST's Cro&s;s. <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.16. <HI>GOD &s;o loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that who&s;o|ever believeth in him, &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have ever|la&s;ting Life.</HI> GOD the Son was manife&s;t in the Fle&s;h, and hath recommended his Love towards us, in that when we were Sinners, he died for us. Let this Love then con&s;train us to give up our &s;elves to GOD by JESUS CHRIST; to love, obey, and &s;erve him for ever according to the new Covenant. <HI>Ki&s;s the Son,</HI> believe in him, and embrace him as the only Saviour; then he will clothe you with his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and make you beautiful with his Comline&s;s put upon you: And being e&s;pou&s;ed to him in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and Judgment, and Loving kindne&s;s; GOD the Father will be well plea&s;ed with you; he <HI>will re&s;t in his Love,</HI> and rejoice over you with Singing.
