</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Words now read, naturally lead your Thoughts to the awful Providence of the Week pa&s;t; when the Earth &s;hook and trembled, and the Foundations al&s;o of the Hills moved and were &s;haken: When, like the trembling Jaylor, every one was awaken'd out of his &s;leep with the Roar of an Earthquake, and threaten'd with immediate De&s;truction. They al&s;o lead us to the Origin of that awful Event, <HI>viz.</HI> the Wrath of God. He &s;hook the Earth becau&s;e he was wroth, and therein expre&s;s'd his Indignation at Sin, and Re&s;ent|ment of the Affronts that were offer'd to his infinite Maje&s;ty, by a profane and rebellious World.</P>
<P>Accordingly, in &s;peaking to the Words,

<P N="1">I. I &s;hall di&s;cour&s;e to you upon Earthquakes; and &s;hall con&s;ider them either as univer&s;al or particular.</P>
<P N="1">1. Earthquakes may be univer&s;al. That God who at the Beginning
<PB N="4" REF="007374_0003_102B8BD735164560">
made the World, can &s;hake it at his Plea&s;ure; and as his Power is infi|nite and irre&s;i&s;tible, he can &s;hake all and every Part, as well as any parti|cular Part of it. Nor is there any Thing in Nature that militates again&s;t this Principle. The righteous and wi&s;e Maker and Governor of the Univer&s;e has planted his Artillery in every Part and Corner of the Earth, to pre&s;erve the Homage, and to &s;uppre&s;s the Rebellion of his Creatures; and the &s;ame natural Cau&s;es, by a Commi&s;&s;ion from God, may as well operate and concur to produce an univer&s;al, as a particular Earthquake.</P>
<P>Such an univer&s;al Earthquake there &s;eems to have been, both at the Death and Re&s;urrection of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. We read in <HI>Matt.</HI> 27.50. <HI>that when Je&s;us gave up the Gho&s;t, the Vail of the Temple was rent in twain, from the Top to the Bottom, and the Earth did quake, and the Rocks rent.</HI> And <HI>Matt.</HI> 28.2. <HI>That at his Re&s;urrection from the Dead, there was a great Earthquake.</HI></P>
<P>And no wonder that Nature was &s;eiz'd with an univer&s;al Convul&s;ion, when the God of Nature was &s;truggling in the Agonies of Death. When his Soul and Body were violently rending from each other, no wonder that the Rocks rent, and that the Earth trembled. And why &s;hould not the whole Earth be equally affected, when the Lord of Glory ex|erted a Divine Power, and bur&s;t the Doors, and broke the Bars of the Grave a&s;under, and came forth? Nature ow'd her Lord that Re&s;pect, to bear a Sympathy with him, both in the Agonies of his Death, and in the Triumphs of his Re&s;urrection.</P>
<P>And the &s;econd Coming of our Lord, will be attended with &s;uch an univer&s;al Earthquake, at which the mo&s;t hardy Sinner will be afraid, and trembling will &s;urprize the Hypocrite. Hence that Prediction in <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 24.17, 18, 19. <HI>Fear, and the Pit, and the Snare are upon thee, O In|habitant of the Earth. And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that he who fleeth from the Noi&s;e of the Fear, &s;hall fall into the Pit; and he that cometh up out of the Mid&s;t of the Pit, &s;hall be taken in the Snare; for the Windows from on high are open, and the Foundations of the Earth do &s;hake. The Earth is utterly broken down, the Earth is clean di&s;&s;olved, the Earth is moved exceedingly. The Earth &s;hall reel to and fro like a Drunkard, and &s;hall be removed like a Cottage, and the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion thereof &s;hall be heavy upon it, and it &s;hall fall and not ri&s;e again.</HI> And of the &s;ame awful Period, we read in <HI>Rev.</HI> 16.15, 18, 19. <HI>Behold, I come as a Thief. Ble&s;&s;ed is he that watcheth&mdash;And there were Voices, and Thunders, and Lightnings; and there was a great
<PB N="5" REF="007374_0004_102B8BD919538158">
Earthquake, &s;uch as was not &s;ince Men were upon the Earth, &s;o mighty an Earthquake, and &s;o great. And the great City was divided into three Parts, and the Cities of the Nations fell; and great</HI> Babylon <HI>came into Remembrance before God, to give unto her the Cup of the Wine of the Fiercene&s;s of his Wrath. And every I&s;land fled away, and the Mountains were not found.</HI></P>
<P>But (2) Earthquakes may be particular, <HI>i. e.</HI> in particular Places, at particular Times and Sea&s;ons. Before that awful Period, when univer|&s;al Nature &s;hall &s;truggle in its expiring Agonies, our Saviour tells us, in <HI>Matt.</HI> 24.7. <HI>That there &s;hall be Earthquakes in divers Places.</HI></P>
<P>Now the&s;e are various in their Duration, Extent, and Degree. And it is &s;aid, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Prince</HI>'s Sermons after the Earthquake in <HI>1727.</HI></NOTE>
<Q>Sometimes there are threatning Simptoms, and &s;ometimes they come &s;uddenly, and without any previous Notice. Sometimes in dreadful Tempe&s;ts, but oftener in the calme&s;t and &s;erene&s;t Sea&s;ons. They are &s;ometimes of a narrower, at others of a larger Compa&s;s. Sometimes their Shocks are of a &s;horter, at others, of a longer Dura|tion. Some are of a le&s;&s;er, others of a greater Violence. Sometimes they quickly cea&s;e, and leave the Earth at Re&s;t; at other Times they &s;oon repeat their terrible Efforts, and throw the Earth into new Con|vul&s;ions. Sometimes they make the Earth to jar and vibrate, and &s;ometimes to waver like the Waves of the Sea. In &s;uch a Manner was the Place &s;haken, where the Apo&s;tles were a&s;&s;embled, <HI>Acts</HI> 4.31. And thus the Foundations of the Pri&s;on where <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> lay bound, were &s;haken by a great and &s;udden Earthquake.</Q></P>
<P>And how terrible are the Effects of Earthquakes! Whole Towns and Cities have thereby been de&s;troyed as in a Moment; and the Inhabi|tants have either been buried in the Ruins, or gone down alive into the Pit. Whil&s;t they ble&s;s'd them&s;elves in their Security, and were ready to flatter them&s;elves with an uninterrupted Pro&s;perity, their vain Hopes have been di&s;mounted, and they have been overtaken with &s;wift De|&s;truction. The Earth has opened her Mouth, and &s;wallowed them up quick, and they were no &s;ooner &s;urpriz'd with a Sen&s;e of their Danger, but they de&s;pair'd of Relief.</P>
<P>How &s;udden and how terrible was the De&s;truction of <HI>Korah,</HI> and his Company, by an Earthquake! <HI>After</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>had made an End of &s;peak|ing, the Ground clave a&s;under that was under them, and the Earth opened her Mouth and &s;wallowed them up, and their Hou&s;es, and all the Men that appertained unto</HI> Korah, <HI>and all their Goods. They, and all that appertained
<PB N="6" REF="007374_0005_102B8BDB4F69F7F8">
to them, went down alive into the Pit, and the Earth clo&s;ed upon them; and they peri&s;hed from among the Congregation. And all</HI> I&s;rael <HI>that were round about them, fled at the Cry of them; for they &s;aid, Le&s;t the Earth &s;wallow us up al&s;o:</HI> Numb. 16.31, and onwards.</P>
<P>O the Di&s;tre&s;s and Angui&s;h of the guilty Inhabitants! when the Earth opened her Mouth to &s;wallow them up, and Heaven was inexorable to their Cries! When De&s;truction from the Lord was a Terror to them, and they could &s;ee no Refuge from the Storm of vindictive Ju&s;tice! O the dolorous Shrieks and Outcries of the People, when they &s;aw them|&s;elves going down alive into the Pit, and that there were none that could &s;tay them! No wonder that <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> when they heard their Cry, were terrify'd and amaz'd, and fled, le&s;t that they al&s;o &s;hould he overtaken with the De&s;truction which they &s;aw came upon <HI>Korah,</HI> and his Com|pany, from their incen&s;ed Sovereign. I proceed,</P>
<P N="2">II. To con&s;ider the Wrath of God as the Cau&s;e of Earthquakes.</P>
<P>An Inquiry into the natural Cau&s;es of Earthquakes, would be incon|&s;i&s;tent with my de&s;ign'd Brevity, and might divert your Thoughts from the great fir&s;t Cau&s;e of All; I &s;hall therefore only mention them as the Works of God, and the Means he u&s;es to accompli&s;h his Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Without Regard to &s;econd Cau&s;es, God the &s;upream Governor of the World, is to be con&s;idered as the Author of the&s;e great Events; and they are to be e&s;teem'd the Tokens of his ju&s;t Di&s;plea&s;ure: When God &s;hakes the Earth, and cau&s;es the Foundations of the World to tremble, it is becau&s;e that he is wroth.</P>
<P>As Earthquakes are the Works of God, &s;o he can produce them with|out the Help of natural Cau&s;es. He who at fir&s;t commanded the World out of Nothing into Being, by the Li&s;p of his Plea&s;ure, can di&s;&s;olve its Frame, and make it a Place of De&s;olation and A&s;toni&s;hment. Though he ordinarily makes U&s;e of &s;econd Cau&s;es, yet it is as ea&s;y for Omni|potence to work without them, as by their Co-operation and A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>If God who made the World at the beginning, &s;hould only &s;u&s;pend that Power by which he upholds and pre&s;erves it, it would reel and &s;tagger like a Drunkard, and tumble into Ruin. Without exerting any Power for its De&s;truction, it would as effectually an&s;wer his De&s;ign, to withdraw the Power by which he &s;upports it.</P>
<P>The Frown of his Countenance, without the Concurrence of natural Cau&s;es, would in&s;tantly bury the World in its own Ruins. Hence we read in <HI>Joh</HI> 9.4, 5. <HI>He is wi&s;e in Heart, and mighty in Strength&mdash;which removeth the Mountains and they know not; which overturneth them in his
<PB N="7" REF="007374_0006_102B8C8493CE5FA0">
Anger: Which &s;haketh the Earth out of her Place, and the Pillars thereof tremble.</HI> And in what lofty Expre&s;&s;ions does the P&s;almi&s;t &s;peak of the Maje&s;ty and Power of God, <HI>P&s;a.</HI> 104.32. <HI>He looketh on the Earth, and it trembleth; he toucheth the Hills, and they &s;moke.</HI></P>
<P>But if we con&s;ider Earthquakes as the Product of natural Cau&s;es, of contrary and di&s;agreeing Elements in the Bowels of the Earth, that meeting, make a mo&s;t violent Concu&s;&s;ion. I &s;ay, if we con&s;ider Earth|quakes as the Product of natural Cau&s;es, yet we mu&s;t ultimately re&s;olve them into the powerful Agency of God, the great Governor of the Univer&s;e. For, who but he made tho&s;e Cau&s;es which produce &s;uch Effects, and &s;ets them a Moving? Who planted that Artillery in the Bowels of the Earth, and di&s;charges it in &s;o terrible a Manner? Who directs its Cour&s;e, and cau&s;es it to &s;hake &s;ome Parts of the World, and not others? Who gives it a Commi&s;&s;ion to de&s;troy &s;ome Places, and at the &s;ame Time pre&s;erves others? Shall we look upon the&s;e Things only as the Effects of Nature, or &s;hall we not rather a&s;cribe them to a Divine Almighty Power? To that God who made all Things, and has all Nature under his Command, to &s;erve his Purpo&s;es in the Go|vernment of the World.</P>
<P>Now, as Earthquakes are the Works of a divine and almighty Agent, &s;o they are &s;ome of the terrible Effects of his Wrath. He &s;hakes the Earth, and cau&s;es the Foundations of the Hills to be moved and &s;haken, when he is wroth, He who made the World at fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> his Power, and governs it by an indi&s;putable Authority, hath placed his Artillery in the Earth and under the Earth, both to cha&s;ti&s;e the In&s;olence of his rebellious Creatures, and by the commanding Awe of his Judgments, to maintain the Homage and Obedience of his People.</P>
<P>As God is invi&s;ible, &s;o his Di&s;plea&s;ure is known by the Judgments which he executeth in the Earth. There is not any Number of his Armies; and from the Magazine of his Fury, he brings out many Judgments to cha&s;ti&s;e a &s;inful People. <HI>Fire and Hail, Snow and Vapour, &s;tormy Wind fulfil his Word.</HI> P&s;a. 148.8. <HI>He vi&s;its with Thunder and Earthquake, and great Noi&s;e, with Storm and Tempe&s;t, and the Flame of devouring Fire.</HI> I&s;a. 29.6.</P>
<P>Though God is terrible in all the Judgments that he brings upon a &s;inful People, yet in nothing does he appear &s;o full of Dread and Terror, as when he makes the Earth under us to tremble and quake. The Sword, and Famine, and Pe&s;tilence, are very terrible Judgments, that have no Re&s;pect to Per&s;ons, that devour one as well as another, and mul|tiply
<PB N="8" REF="007374_0007_102B845B765A6208">
the Slain of the Lord. But then the&s;e Calamities are gradual in their Progre&s;s, and either give us Time to e&s;cape them, or to prepare to meet them. But Earthquakes for the mo&s;t Part come &s;uddenly, without any previous Notice, and &s;urprize Sinners in the mid&s;t of their Security and Ea&s;e. Whil&s;t they are crying Peace to them&s;elves, &s;udden De|&s;truction comes upon them, as Travail upon a Woman with Child, and there is no e&s;caping.</P>
<P>To what can we impute &s;uch terrible Events, but to incens'd Omni|potence? Judgment is God's &s;trange Work, what he has an Aver&s;ion to, and &s;eems to proceed in with the greate&s;t Reluctance. When he is about to bring Ruin upon a &s;inful People, his Heart is oftentimes turned within him, and his Repentings are kindled together; &s;o that he does not execute the Fiercene&s;s of his Anger. The Father of Mercies does not grieve and afflict the Children of Men willingly, but for the Puni&s;h|ment of their Sins, to revenge the Affronts that are offered to his infinite Maje&s;ty, and he &s;ees that all other Means are ineffectual to reclaim them.</P>
<P>How dreadful then is the Wrath of God! The Wrath of a King is as the Roaring of a Lion, which &s;trikes with Surprize and Amazement; but what is that to the Anger of an incen&s;ed Deity? who removeth Mountains, and they know not; which overturneth them in his Anger, and at who&s;e Reproof the very Pillars of Heaven tremble, and are a&s;toni&s;hed. Hence &s;ays the Prophet, <HI>Hab.</HI> 3.10. <HI>The Mountains &s;aw thee and they trembled: Thou did&s;t march through the Land in Indignation.</HI></P>
<P>The Prophet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> expre&s;sly mentions (chap. 38.19, 20.) the Anger of God as the Cau&s;e of this particular Judgment. <HI>For in my Jealou&s;y, and in the Fire of my Wrath have I &s;poken: Surely in that Day there &s;hall be a great Skaking in the Land of</HI> I&s;rael; <HI>&s;o that the Fi&s;hes of the Sea, and the Fowls of Heaven, and the Bea&s;ts of the Field, and all creeping Things that creep upon the Earth, and all the Men that are upon the Face of the Earth, &s;hall &s;hake at my Pre&s;ence; and the Mountains &s;hall be thrown down, and the &s;teep Places &s;hall fall, and every Wall &s;hall fall to the Ground.</HI> And the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> after &s;uch a particular De&s;cription of this Judgment, as if he had been an Eye-witne&s;s of it, a&s;cribes it to the Anger of an offended Deity. <HI>I beheld the Mountains,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>and lo they trembled, and all the Hills moved lightly. I beheld and lo there was no Man, and all the Birds of Heaven were fled. I beheld, and in the fruitful Place was a Wil|derne&s;s, and all the Cities thereof were broken down at the Pre&s;ence of the Lord, and at his fierce Anger</HI>: Chap. 4.24, 25, 26.</P>
<P>Having con&s;idered Earthquakes as the dreadful Effects of God's Wrath, I proceed</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="9" REF="007374_0008_102B845D4507C010">III. To make &s;ome Application of the Subject, &s;uitable to the awful Occa&s;ion. And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. In Earthquakes, we have a mo&s;t lively and affecting Di&s;play of the glorious Maje&s;ty of the Lord our God.</P>
<P>What more lively Di&s;play can there be of the Maje&s;ty of God, than to &s;ee the inanimate Creation awaken'd out of its &s;lumber at his Pre|&s;ence! To &s;ee the Earth tremble, and the Mountains quake at his Re|buke! <HI>The Mountains &s;kip like Rams, and the little Hills like Lambs. The Earth trembles at the Pre&s;ence of the Lord, at the Pre&s;ence of the God of</HI> I&s;rael: <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 114.4, 7.</P>
<P N="2">2. We learn the wretched Stupidity of Sinners, who are regardle&s;s of God, and the Operations of his Hands. If the Heavens are a&s;ton|i&s;hed, and the Earth is afraid at the Anger of the Lord, it may well make Sinners tremble, and cau&s;e their Hearts to be removed out of their Place. For he that &s;hakes the Earth, can &s;hake them into Hell in a Moment, and torment them in the Fire of his Jealou&s;y forever.</P>
<P>But &s;uch is the unaccountable Stupidity and Hardne&s;s of Sinners, that oftentimes they will provoke God to his Face: They mock the Thun|der of his Judgments, and de&s;pi&s;e the glittering Spear of almighty Ven|geance. The Belief of his Ju&s;tice and Power makes the very Devils to tremble; and yet the Judgments of God are oftentimes ineffectual to reclaim ob&s;tinate and incorrigible Sinners, who dare to affront his infinite Maje&s;ty, as if they were a Match for Omnipotence, as if they could re&s;i&s;t his Fury, or &s;upport his heavy Indignation.</P>
<P N="3">3. We learn the dreadful Evil of Sin, and the woful Folly of Sin|ners, which provoke God's Wrath and Indignation.</P>
<P>Sin con&s;ider'd in it&s;elf, and ab&s;tracted from its woful Con&s;equences, is a mo&s;t tremendous Evil. As it is a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Law, it is an Affront to the &s;upream Lawgiver, and ob&s;cures the Glory of his At|tributes, which are exerci&s;ed in the Government of the World. As it &s;trikes at God, and provokes his Jealou&s;y, &s;o it recoils upon the Sinner, and involves him in innumerable Evils. It hath &s;trip'd Man of his ori|ginal Purity, and &s;tain'd him with an univer&s;al Pollution. It hath de|graded Man from that Honour and Dignity, in which he was at fir&s;t created; &s;o that he is become like the Bea&s;ts that peri&s;h, and expo&s;es him to Death, in all its fearful and amazing Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The Evil of Sin, &s;hews us the woful Folly of Sinners, who daily pro|voke God's Wrath and Fury. Tho' Sin is &s;uch an amazing Evil in it &s;elf, and &s;uch an Indignity to the ble&s;&s;ed God, as to rai&s;e his ju&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="007374_0009_102B845F25E30D08">
Re&s;entment, yet Sinners roll it as a &s;weet Mor&s;el under their Tongues; and, if we may judge by their Conduct, they had rather lo&s;e their Souls, than abandon their Lu&s;ts. They turn a deaf Ear to all the Warnings of God's Word, and de&s;pi&s;e the Grace of God, which teaches them to deny all Ungodline&s;s and worldly Lu&s;ts, and to live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly, in the pre&s;ent World.</P>
<P>O the amazing Folly of Sinners! to indulge their Lu&s;ts at the Hazard of their Souls! and to pur&s;ue their Sins with &s;uch Greedine&s;s, which, unle&s;s almighty Grace prevents, will end in Shame and everla&s;ting Death.</P>
<P N="4">4. Is the Wrath of God the Cau&s;e of the mo&s;t fearful Judgments, then let us &s;tand in awe, and not &s;in again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The Fear of God. and his Judgments, &s;hould create an unalterable Divorce between us and our Sins, and we &s;hould have nothing more to do with the accur&s;ed Thing which his Soul hates. Becau&s;e there is Wrath, we &s;hould beware of Sin, which an infinitely pure and holy God, cannot behold without the greate&s;t Indignation and Abhorrence.</P>
<P N="5">5. Let us reflect with the highe&s;t Gratitude, upon the Mercy of God, which interpos'd for our Pre&s;ervation and Safety, at the very In&s;tant of our Danger.</P>
<P>What a Con&s;ternation and Surprize were we in, when awaken'd out of our Sleep with the Roar of an Earthquake! Every One's Lips &s;eem'd to quiver, and their Knees to &s;mite one again&s;t another, when we were apprehen&s;ive of in&s;tant De&s;truction, and could &s;ee no Refuge in Nature for our Protection.</P>
<P>But in the mid&s;t of Judgment, God remember'd Mercy for us, and appear'd as a pre&s;ent Help in the Time of our Trouble and Di&s;tre&s;s. When the Sorrows of Death compa&s;&s;ed us about, and the Pains of Hell threaten'd to take hold upon us; before we had Time to call upon the Name of the Lord, he deliver'd us: He rode upon the Heavens for our Help, and in his Excellency upon the Skies, as our great Pre&s;erver. <HI>O that Men would prai&s;e the Lord for his Goodne&s;s, and for his wonderful Works to the Children of Men.</HI></P>
<P>The Goodne&s;s of God in our Pre&s;ervation, appears mo&s;t amiable and a&s;toni&s;hing, when we con&s;ider how we have provok'd him by our Sins, and how his Ju&s;tice would have been glorify'd in our De&s;truction. If he had &s;ent us quick into the Grave, and into Hell, God and his Throne would have been guiltle&s;s and un&s;potted forever, and we &s;hould have been ju&s;tly and eternally mi&s;erable: And his Mercy might have been extended to tho&s;e who would have receiv'd it with the highe&s;t Gratitude,
<PB N="11" REF="007374_0010_102B8460EF9F7F70">
and not abus'd it as we have done. But Mercy interpos'd for us, who were the Objects of avenging Ju&s;tice, and rejoic'd again&s;t Judgment for our Deliverance. <HI>It is of the Lord's Mercies that we are not utterly con&s;umed, even becau&s;e his Compo&s;&s;ions towards us have not failed.</HI></P>
<P>And what enhances the Goodne&s;s of God, and our Obligations to love and admire it, is the De&s;olations that Earthquakes have made in other Places, and to think how often God has appear'd for our Land, when in the like Danger. The mo&s;t rich and flouri&s;hing Cities have been depopulated as in a Moment, and buried in their own Ruins. And be&s;ides other remarkable Judgments that our Land has been vi&s;ited with, this is the <HI>eleventh</HI> or <HI>twelfth</HI> Earthquake that has been perceiv'd &s;ince the Arrival of our Fathers here, and within 120 Years. Many Shocks indeed have been &s;maller, and le&s;s exten&s;ive, but this is the <HI>fifth</HI> that has been very awak'ning, and that has ju&s;tly fill'd our Land with Terror and Surprize. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">For a more particular Account, &s;ee the Rev. Mr. <HI>Prince</HI>'s Letter on Earthquakes, lately publi&s;hed.</NOTE></P>
<P>And now, after &s;o many In&s;tances of remarkable Danger and Pre|&s;ervation, whil&s;t we tremble at his Rebukes; what Obligations are we under to love the Lord, and to admire his Goodne&s;s. When his Judg|ments awaken us out of our Security, and de&s;troy our vain Confidence, we &s;hould be encouraged by his Goodne&s;s, to make him the &s;upream Object of our Hope and Tru&s;t, and devote our&s;elves to his Glory, to &s;erve him in Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Holine&s;s all the Days of our Lives.</P>
<P N="6">6. When the Earth &s;hakes and trembles, it teaches us the Vanity of the World, and the Uncertainty of all its Enjoyments.</P>
<P>The World is the admir'd Idol that engro&s;&s;es the Affections of the unthinking Multitude, and engages them in the eager Pur&s;uit of it. This they make the Object of their &s;upream Dependance, their Views and Aims; their Hopes and De&s;ires are confin'd to the Things that are &s;een, and they vainly imagine that they are &s;ufficient to compleat their Felicity. But &s;ure I am, they are under a mo&s;t woful Infatuation; they tru&s;t to Vanity, and their Hope will end in Shame and Di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>How vain is the World, which how permanent and durable &s;oever, we may imagine it, trembles at the Pre&s;ence of the Lord, and is unable to &s;upport his heavy Indignation! How empty and uncertain are its Enjoyments, that will afford us no Relief in our greate&s;t Extremity&punc; The World is fickle and uncon&s;tant, the Fa&s;hion of it pa&s;&s;es away, anon
<PB N="12" REF="007374_0011_102B8463AC89E2D0">
it will vani&s;h in Flame and Smoke; and tho&s;e that now admire it, will &s;ee it no more. The Apo&s;tle a&s;&s;ures us, <HI>That the Heavens and Earth which now are, are kept in Store, re&s;erved unto Fire, again&s;t the Day of Judg|ment, and Perdition of ungodly Men:</HI> 2 Pet. 3.7.</P>
<P>What an indelible Reproach is it then to the human Nature, that Men who are endow'd with rea&s;onable Souls, &s;hould &s;uffer them&s;elves to be deluded and impos'd upon by a World, &s;o fal&s;e and uncertain, &s;o empty and un&s;atisfying; that they &s;hould embrace it as their &s;upream Good, and lo&s;e their Souls for the Sake of gaining the World! If Men would take as much Pains for heavenly, as they do for earthly Trea&s;ure, they would have a greater Probability of Succe&s;s, their Gains would be infinitely preferable, and their Rewards eternally glorious; they would then be rich in Grace, and Heirs of a Kingdom, Heirs of God, and joint Heirs with Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to an Inheritance which is incorruptible, and undefiled, and which fadeth not away. But tho&s;e who devote them|&s;elves to the Service of the World, and are engag'd in the eager Pur&s;uit of it, labour in vain, and &s;pend their Strength for nought, and in vain. For, what Profit will the Gains of this World be to a Soul which is &s;piritual, and of an immortal Duration, which will &s;urvive the Ruins of Nature, and be un&s;peakably ble&s;&s;ed in the Enjoyment of God forever, or eternally mi&s;erable, under the Weight of his dreadful Di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P N="7">7. How happy are all tho&s;e who have the everla&s;ting God for their Refuge, and are in a State of Peace and Favour with him.</P>
<P>They are happy in the mo&s;t perilous Times, the Favour of God is their Protection, and they are &s;afe under the Shadow of the Almighty. They po&s;&s;e&s;s their Souls in Peace, when all Nature is in Convul&s;ions; and are fearle&s;s and &s;ecure amid&s;t
<Q>the Wars of Elements and Cru&s;h of Worlds.</Q>
They may &s;ay, as in <HI>P&s;a.</HI> 46. beg. <HI>God is our Refuge and Strength, a very pre&s;ent Help in Trouble; therefore will we not fear, tho' the Earth be removed, and tho' the Mountains be carried into the mid&s;t of the Sea, tho the Waters thereof roar, and be troubled, tho' the Mountains &s;hake with the Swelling thereof.</HI> They know that if their earthly Tabernacles be di&s;&s;olved, they have a Building of God, an Hou&s;e not made with Hands, eternal in the Heavens: Or, that if the Earth &s;hould open her Mouth, and &s;wallow them up, it would afford them a quick and ea&s;y Pa&s;&s;age to a World of immortal Light and Love: Or, &s;hould &s;uch re|main alive at the Coming of our Lord, when he &s;hall come in the Clouds of Heaven, with Power and great Glory, they will welcome the Day of his Appearance, as the Day of the un&s;peakable Joy and Gladne&s;s of their
<PB N="13" REF="007374_0012_102B8BDD2F9D83A0">
Hearts. They will not be di&s;may'd at the Flames of a di&s;&s;olving World, when the Heavens &s;hall pa&s;s away with a great Noi&s;e, and the Elements &s;hall melt with fervent Heat, and the Earth al&s;o, and the Works that are therein, &s;hall be burnt up.</P>
<P N="8">8. Let us, from what has been &s;aid, enquire wherefore it is, that God is angry with us, and endeavour by a &s;peedy Repentance to appea&s;e his Wrath, and prevent further Tokens of his Di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The Judgments of God, with which our Land is vi&s;ited, are to be e&s;teem'd &s;o many Tokens of his Di&s;plea&s;ure: Particularly, that he is calling us to draw the Sword in our own Defence, and to maintain our Rights again&s;t the Encroachments of a potent, &s;ubtle, and malicious Enemy: That, notwith&s;tanding the Victory and Succe&s;s that have crown'd &s;ome of our Forces, others have been frown'd upon and di&s;ap|pointed: That we have been call'd to lament the Fall of the Mighty, and that &s;o much of the Beauty and Glory of our <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> have been &s;lain in the high Places of the Field: That mo&s;t of our Attempts have hi|therto prov'd abortive: That the Sword of the Wilderne&s;s is un&s;heath'd again&s;t us: That the unhappy People upon our Frontiers, are in Jeo|pardy every Hour, and expos'd to bloody and deceitful Men, who&s;e tender Mercies are cruel; and that we &s;o frequently hear of the De&s;o|lations that are made among them, of &s;ome butcher'd and &s;calp'd, and of others carried into a doleful Captivity.</P>
<P>And now, as if all the&s;e Calamities were in&s;ufficient to awaken us out of our Security, and to humble us for our Sins, God has been vi&s;iting with Earthquake, and thereby &s;ummoned us to dread and reverence. He march'd thro' the Land in Indignation, and his Pre&s;ence &s;truck us with Terror and Surprize.</P>
<P>It becomes us then to enquire, wherefore it is that God is contending with us, and to be humbled before him for our Sins, the Cau&s;e of his righteous Di&s;plea&s;ure. In&s;tead of complaining of the Severity of his Judgments, we have Rea&s;on to admire at the Patience and Forbearance of the mo&s;t High towards us; for our Iniquities are increa&s;ed over our Heads, and our Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es are grown up to the very Heavens, and cry for Vengeance again&s;t us. Should I attempt to draw up a black Cata|logue of the Crimes that prevail among us, I &s;hould &s;carce know where to begin and when to end; and therefore, in&s;tead of enumerating Par|ticulars, I &s;hall only mention two Things, as Aggravations of all our other Abominations, and which threaten to deluge our Land in Mi&s;ery
<PB N="14" REF="007374_0013_102B8BDEC0ED6570">
and Woe, namely, The Means of Grace that we enjoy, and our Impu|dence and Shamele&s;ne&s;s in Sin.</P>
<P>The Means of Grace, if they are not effectual to reform a &s;inful Peo|ple, &s;erve only to enhance their Guilt, and expo&s;e them a more fearful Prey to the Judgments of God. The Light of the Go&s;pel renders their Guilt inexcu&s;able, and their Contempt of his Grace, provokes God's dreadful Jealou&s;y. As we are a di&s;tingui&s;hed People, &s;o, if we think that the Privileges we enjoy, and our Relation to God, as his People, will &s;kreen us from his Wrath, whil&s;t we continue to provoke him by our Sins, we deceive our&s;elves with a vain Imagination. The People of the <HI>Jews</HI> gloried in their having the Temple, and Temple-wor&s;hip among them, as that which they thought would effectually &s;ecure the Pre&s;ence of God with them; but the Prophet tells them, That they deceiv'd them&s;elves, and tru&s;ted in lying Words, whil&s;t they cried, <HI>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord are we</HI>; as if that alone would &s;ecure his Favour, and keep off his Judgments from them. If our Fruitfulne&s;s is not in Proportion to what God hath done for us, we may expect that he will do by us, as he did by his Vineyard of old; that he will pluck us up, and pull us down; that he will lay us wa&s;te and de&s;troy us.</P>
<P>Shamele&s;sne&s;s in Sin, is another Thing that has a very threatning A&s;|pect upon a People. Thus we read, <HI>Jer.</HI> 6.15. <HI>Were they a&s;hamed when they had committed Abominations? Nay, they were not at all a&s;hamed, nei|ther could they blu&s;h: Therefore they &s;hall fall among them that fall: At the Time that I vi&s;it them, they &s;hall be ca&s;t down, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> That this is very much our Ca&s;e, is too evident to need any Proof. Vice and Immorality are grown barefac'd and impudent, and &s;o degenerate is the Age in which we live, that he that departeth from Evil, &s;eems to make him&s;elf a Prey, by expo&s;ing him&s;elf to the Scoff and Ridicule of pro|phane and licentious Tongues. Many there are who declare their Sin as <HI>Sodom,</HI> and hide it not, and even glory in their Shame. Now when Sinners grow &s;hamele&s;s and impudent in Sin, it looks as if no Laws were &s;ufficient to curb their Lu&s;ts, and re&s;train their In&s;olence; and the Cau&s;e of Virtue then makes its Appeal to the righteous Judge and Governor of the World, to cha&s;ti&s;e tho&s;e Enormities which are too &s;trong for the Laws of Men to correct and re&s;train.</P>
<P>God &s;eems to have taken us into his own Hands, to cha&s;ti&s;e us for our Rebellion and Di&s;obedience; and we have Rea&s;on to fear that the
<PB N="15" REF="007374_0014_102B8BE07A0C8110">
Earthquake with which he has vi&s;ited us, will be but the Beginning of our Sorrows, unle&s;s we hearken to his Voice, and turn at his Rebuke.</P>
<P>Wherefore, let us all be per&s;uaded to improve that awful Di&s;pen&s;ation, as a Motive to Repentance and Reformation. Like <HI>Saul</HI> in the mid&s;t of his A&s;toni&s;hment, when he fell down trembling to the Earth, let us cry out, <HI>Lord, what wilt thou have us to do?</HI> And like the Jaylor, when he was &s;urpriz'd with an Earthquake, let us make it our great Concern and Enquiry, <HI>What we &s;hall do to be &s;aved?</HI> Let us all hear the Rod, and him that appointed it: Let us &s;earch our Ways, and our Hearts: Let us con&s;ider what we have done to provoke the Holy One to Anger again&s;t us, and how much we have contributed to the public Flames and Judgments; and let us break off our Sins by Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and our Iniquities by turning to the Lord. Let us all return unto the Lord as one Man, and then we may depend upon it, that the Lord will have Mercy upon us, and that our God will abundantly pardon us: <HI>As he hath torn, be will heal us; as he hath &s;mitten, he will bind us up.</HI></P>
<P>Let us look to God, that he would &s;anctify this Di&s;pen&s;ation to us, and that his Holy Spirit may be poured out upon us, as it was when the Place was &s;haken, where the primitive Chri&s;tians were a&s;&s;embled; as we read <HI>Acts</HI> 4.31. <HI>And when they had prayed, the Place was &s;haken where they were a&s;&s;embled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Gho&s;t, and they &s;pake the Word of God with Boldne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>What an happy Effect had the Earthquake in 1727, to awaken the Secure, to reform the Vicious, and to make all &s;olicitous about their &s;piritual and everla&s;ting Concerns, as the Account is tran&s;mitted to us by a Per&s;on <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See an Appendix to the Rev. Mr. <HI>Prince</HI>'s Sermons after the Earth|quake in <HI>1727.</HI></NOTE> of Ob&s;ervation and Integrity. Says he,
<Q>The People are thereby thrown into the utmo&s;t Con&s;ternation; and &s;o mightily are many awakened, with the Sen&s;e of their Danger, and the Divine Di&s;|plea&s;ure, as has produc'd a wonderful Reformation. Profanene&s;s, Drunkenne&s;s, and other Vices are abandoned, the earne&s;t Pur&s;uits of the World di&s;carded, the Places of public Religion throng'd, the Wor&s;hip of God &s;et up in prayerle&s;s Families, and great Numbers continually added to the flouri&s;hing Churches.</Q></P>
<P><Q>What a Joy is there, even as the Joy of Harve&s;t, and as Men re|joice when they divide the Spoil! What an happy Effu&s;ion of the Holy Spirit! And O! how &s;hould this excite us, not only to glorify
<PB N="16" REF="007374_0015_102B8BE25DA658E8">
God for his Goodne&s;s among them, but al&s;o to de&s;ire and pray that the &s;ame Grace may likewi&s;e be &s;hewed to us, the &s;ame Spirit poured out upon us and ours, in the &s;ame glorious Mea&s;ures. And how &s;hould their Examples &s;tir us up to a wi&s;e and happy Imitation! For the Fear of the Lord is the Beginning of Wi&s;dom, and a good Un|der&s;tanding have all they that do his Commandments.</Q>
Thus he.</P>
<P>If the late Earthquake has the &s;ame Effect upon us and our Land, it will eventually prove an ine&s;timable Ble&s;&s;ing, as it will turn away the Anger of the Lord, and prevent further Tokens of his Di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Let us all then take the Alarm, and next to reforming our&s;elves, let us exert our&s;elves in our re&s;pective Capacities, for the Suppre&s;&s;ion of Vice and Immorality, and for the Encouragement of Virtue and Religion.</P>
<P>Thus, let tho&s;e who are clothed with Authority, be per&s;uaded to u&s;e it for the Suppre&s;&s;ion of Vice and Immorality, and for the Encourage|ment of Virtue and good Order among us. As you are the Mini&s;ters of God, &s;o it is for the Good of the People; and what greater Good can you do, than to puni&s;h Vice and Immorality, which are a Reproach to a People, and involves them in the fore&s;t Calamities.</P>
<P>Says the pre&s;ent Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> in a Letter about <HI>five</HI> Years ago upon a like Occa&s;ion,
<Q>I &s;hould be wanting in the Duty I owe to the Highe&s;t as well as the Lowe&s;t, &s;hould I omit on this Occa&s;ion to re|mind tho&s;e who are entru&s;ted by their Country with Government, how much the Welfare of the People depends upon the faithful Execution of the Law. I pretend not to accu&s;e them particularly of Neglect, a general Neglect of this Kind, is one of the wor&s;t Symptoms of the Times. Surely it is high Time to awake, and to let People once more know, what &s;eems to be almo&s;t forgotten, that Laws were made for the Puni&s;hment of Wickedne&s;s and Vice, and for the Mainte|nance of true Religion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Government is a great Tru&s;t, and the Powers of it are not intended meerly to do Honour to tho&s;e who have them, but mu&s;t be u&s;ed for the Good of the Community&mdash;If a Regard for the Public is not a Mo|tive &s;trong enough in this Ca&s;e, let every Magi&s;trate con&s;ider that there is another of infinite Importance to him&s;elf; for if all Power be the Ordinance of God, he will undoubtedly demand an Account of the Exerci&s;e of it. And who is he that has &s;o little to an&s;wer for up|on his own Account, as willingly to &s;ubject him&s;elf to be an&s;werable for the Sins of others, which either by his Encouragement, or his Connivance, he makes his own.</Q>
Thus he</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="007374_0016_102B8BE47342F878">And not only &s;hould Rulers, by a faithful Di&s;charge of the Tru&s;ts re|pos'd in them, be a Terror to evil Doers, but by their Examples, they &s;hould be a Prai&s;e and Encouragement to them that do well. If Rulers are not Examples of Virtue, it can never be expected that they will di&s;|courage Vice. With what Face can he puni&s;h Vice, who is a Man of known Immorality, and of a mo&s;t infamous and abandoned Character? Rulers are called <HI>Gods,</HI> and therefore &s;hould endeavour to imitate the ble&s;&s;ed God in his moral Perfections. An unholy God is a Contradiction in Terms: And how incongruous would it be, to &s;ee tho&s;e who are <HI>God's</HI> by Vicegerency and Deputation, live like Devils in the Indulgence of their Lu&s;ts.</P>
<P>And thus al&s;o, let Parents and Heads of Families exert them&s;elves in their proper Places, and endeavour by their Example and In&s;truction, to recommend Religion and Virtue to tho&s;e under their Care. Great are the Obligations you are under hereunto, and great are the Expectations of God, and his People from you. If Youth are corrupted in their Religion and Morals, before they come into the World, there is but little Hopes that ever the World will reform them.</P>
<P><Q>Reformation mu&s;t begin in private Families. The Law and the Magi&s;trate can only puni&s;h your Children when they become wicked, but it is you that mu&s;t make them good, by proper In&s;truction and proper Government.</Q></P>
<P>The Judgments of God will eventually prove our riche&s;t Mercies, if they are the Means of our Reformation and Amendment; for then Glory will dwell in our Land, and God, even our own God, will de|light to ble&s;s us.</P>
<P N="9">9. Let what we have heard, lead our Thoughts to that terrible Day of the Lord, which will come as a Thief in the Night, in the which the Hea|vens &s;hall pa&s;s away with a great Noi&s;e, and the Elements &s;hall melt with fervent Heat, and the World, and all Things in it, &s;hall be burnt up. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour has given us frequent Warnings of that Day, and tells us, That when we hear of Wars, and Rumours of Wars, and of Earthquakes, that the&s;e Things are but the Beginning of Sorrows.</P>
<P>And now, Brethren, <HI>&s;eeing that all the&s;e Things &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved, what Manner of Per&s;ons ought ye to be in all holy Conver&s;ation and Godline&s;s. Looking for and ha&s;tening unto the Day of the Coming of God; wherein the Heavens being on Fire &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved, and the Elements &s;hall melt with fer|vent Heat&mdash;Seeing that ye look for &s;uch Things, be diligent, that ye may be found of him in Peace, without Spot, and blamele&s;s,</HI> AMEN.</P>
