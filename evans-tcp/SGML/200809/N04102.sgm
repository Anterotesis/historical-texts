<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Matth. XXII. 39.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>And the &s;econd is like unto it, Thou &s;halt love thy Neighbour as thy &s;elf.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_WE have con&s;ider'd the <HI>fir&s;t and great Commandment,</HI> which &s;ummarily com|prehends in it our Duty towards God; <HI>Thou &s;halt love the LORD thy GOD with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind.</HI> We proceed now to con&s;ider the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> which comprehends our Duty towards Men in the&s;e Words; <HI>Thou &s;halt love thy Neighbour as thy &s;elf.</HI> And our Saviour declareth that this Commandment is like unto the fir&s;t. I &s;hall endeavour to explain the Text under the following Doctrine.</P>
<P>Doct. <HI>To love our Neighbour as our &s;elves, is the &s;econd Commandment of the Moral Law; and it is like unto the fir&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Under this Doctrine we may con&s;ider I. The Duty required, <HI>Thou &s;halt love thy Neighbour as thy &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="6" REF="005056_0004_101692AC8B998F08">II. Prove that this is the &s;econd Commandment, and is like unto the fir&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>We may con&s;ider the Duty here required; Thou &s;halt love thy Neighbour as thy &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>Under this Head I would &s;peak briefly to the following Particulars. 1. Who is our Neighbour? 2. What is implied in loving our Neighbour? 3. In loving him as our &s;elves?</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Who is our Neighbour?</HI></P>
<P>An&s;w. (1.) <HI>Every Man without Di&s;tinction of Nation, or outward Condition.</HI></P>
<P>Our Love is not to be confin'd to our Friends and Benefactors, or tho&s;e of our own Nation, as the <HI>Phari|&s;ees</HI> taught. The carnal <HI>Jews</HI> were ready to imagine that the <HI>Gentiles</HI> were not included in this Precept. But our great Lord and Lawgiver, in An&s;wer to this Que&s;tion, <HI>Who is my Neighbour?</HI> plainly &s;heweth us that every one is our Neighbour, and that we mu&s;t extend our Charity to all, of what Nation &s;oever, as we have Opportunity. <HI>Luk.</HI> 10.29, &mdash;36, 37. <HI>Which now of the&s;e three, thinke&s;t thou, was Neighbour unto him that fell among Thieves? And he &s;aid, He that &s;hewed Mercy on him. Then &s;aid Je&s;us unto him, Go, and do thou likewi&s;e.</HI> It hath plea&s;ed GOD of one Blood to make all Nations that dwell upon the Earth. We were all one in <HI>Adam,</HI> who was our fir&s;t Father, and our Head and Repre&s;entative in the fir&s;t Covenant: He was created in the Image of GOD, and altho' by his fir&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion we forfeited and lo&s;t that <HI>moral Rectitude</HI> in which the Image of GOD principally con|&s;i&s;ts, yet &s;till Man retains &s;omething of that Image, as he is a Spirit, tho' in Fle&s;h. And agreeably one Rea|&s;on why Murther is puni&s;h'd with Death by the divine Law, we have given, <HI>Gen.</HI> 9.6. <HI>Who&s;e &s;heddeth Man's Blood, by Man &s;hall his Blood he &s;hed; For in the Image
<PB N="7" REF="005056_0005_101692AF44C4F668">
of God made he Man.</HI> And then, we were, in the Loins of our Progenitors, pre&s;erved in the <HI>Ark,</HI> when other Families of Renown in the Earth, &s;unk under the Weight of GOD's Wrath in the Deluge, and have their Names blotted out from under Heaven: And that in a particular Manner for their Violation of this Command. <HI>Gen.</HI> 6.11. <HI>The Earth al&s;o was corrupt be|fore GOD; and the Earth was filled with Violence.</HI> And to ri&s;e higher &s;till, the Son of GOD became Man, and has bought a People with his Blood out of every Tongue and Tribe and Nation. We mu&s;t therefore love, and do good to all Men. And one Way where|in we are to expre&s;s our good Will to them that are unknown, and far from us; is by praying for them to that GOD who fills Heaven and Earth. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.1. <HI>I exhort therefore, that fir&s;t of all, Supplications, Prayers, Interce&s;&s;ions, and giving of Thanks be made for all Men.</HI> Thus we &s;hould expre&s;s our Charity for the Jews and Heathen-Gentile Nations, by looking up to GOD for them, that He would be plea&s;ed to &s;end forth his Light and Truth, and &s;o give them the Know|ledge of him&s;elf, as manife&s;ted in the Face of JESUS CHRIST. Thus the P&s;almi&s;t prays to GOD, <HI>P&s;al,</HI> 67.2, 3. <HI>That thy Way may be known upon Earth, and thy &s;aving Health among all Nations. Let the Peo|ple Prai&s;e thee, O GOD; let all the People prai&s;e thee.</HI> And we mu&s;t take heed we do not attend this Duty whether in public or private, after a formal cu&s;tomary Manner; but that with holy Fervency we thus ex|pre&s;s our earne&s;t De&s;ires of the Advancement of GOD's Glory, and of the Salvation of our Fellow-Creatures. There is a general <HI>Philanthropy,</HI> or Love of Men, which is a Duty that extends to all. We mu&s;t treat Men, tho' ever &s;o mean in their outward Condition and Circum&s;tances, with Humanity; and not like Bea&s;ts. Certainly then, it mu&s;t be a dreadful Violation of this Law for Men to take more Care of their Hor|&s;es,
<PB N="8" REF="005056_0006_101692B2DE3EF738">
and other Brute Creatures, than of the Souls and Bodies of their Servants, tho' in ever &s;o low a Degree of Servitude. And then I may here ob&s;erve that this Law of Love reacheth even to our per&s;onal Enemies. <HI>Mat.</HI> 5. 43, 44. <HI>Ye have heard that it bath been &s;aid, Thou &s;halt love thy Neighbour, and hate thine Enemy: But I &s;ay unto you, Love your Enemies, ble&s;s them that cur&s;e you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which de&s;pitefully u&s;e you and per&s;ecute you.</HI> The Roman Orator and Morali&s;t <HI>Tully,</HI> has this Ob&s;erva|tion, "It is the fir&s;t Duty of Ju&s;tice to hurt no Man, unle&s;s provoked by Injury.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ju&s;titiae primum munus e&s;t, ut ne cui quis noceat, ni&s;i Cace&s;&s;itus injuria. <HI>Tullius de Officiis.</HI> P. 10</NOTE> How divinely excellent are the Laws of Christ, and how far do they excel the mo&s;t refined Heathen Morality! Chri&s;tians are re|quir'd to do good even to them from whom they &s;uffer Evil. <HI>Rom.</HI> 12. 21. <HI>Be not overcome of Evil, but over|come Evil with Good.</HI> Indeed this doth not require us to love &s;uch evil ones with a Love of Complacency, but with a Love of Benevolence. Tho' we are ju&s;tly offended, yet we mu&s;t maintain good Will and a chari|table Di&s;po&s;ition towards &s;uch, wi&s;hing well to them, and being ready to do them good as we have Oppor|tunity. Lord write this Law upon our Hearts!</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>Such are our Neighbours in an e&s;pecial Manner, as &s;tand in any peculiar Relation to us, whether natural, civil or religious.</HI></P>
<P>Our Neighbour is one that is nigh to us. Agreeably, as &s;ome Per&s;ons are in a peculiar Sen&s;e near to us, &s;o they may in an e&s;pecial Manner be call'd our Neigh|bours in the Sen&s;e of my Text; and there is a peculiar Love which by God's Law we are obliged to exerci&s;e towards them. Thus Parents ought to love their Chil|dren, and &s;eek the Well-being of their Offspring,
<PB N="9" REF="005056_0007_101692B6B2C924F8">
with a tender Affection. And <HI>Children</HI> mu&s;t with a dutiful Affection con&s;ult the be&s;t good of their <HI>Parents,</HI> and labour by their kind and re&s;pectful Behaviour to be Ble&s;&s;ings to them. <HI>Brethren and Si&s;ters</HI> mu&s;t labour to be of one Heart, and to dwell together in Unity. It is named as an abominable Iniquity, to be <HI>without natural Affection,</HI> Rom. 1. 31. Such as are united by the <HI>Bonds of Nature</HI> are then under peculiar Obli|gations to love one another. The like may be &s;aid re&s;pecting &s;uch as are nigh to each other in a <HI>civil Re|lation.</HI> There ought to be a &s;ingular Love and En|dearment between <HI>Hu&s;bands and Wives,</HI> who are <HI>one Fle&s;h</HI> in the neare&s;t Union by God's Ordinance. How divine is the Example &s;et before Hu&s;bands to this Purpo&s;e in the pure and ardent Love of Christ to his my&s;tical Body, the Church! <HI>Eph.</HI> 5. 25. <HI>Hu&s;|bands, love your Wives, even as CHRIST al&s;o loved the Church.</HI> Thus <HI>Ma&s;ters</HI> ought in the Exerci&s;e of Love to give unto their <HI>Servants</HI> that which is ju&s;t and equal. They ought to perform their Covenant Agreements with Equity and a kind Di&s;po&s;ition to do them all the Good they can. And <HI>Servants</HI> mu&s;t be obedient to their Ma&s;ters, not with Eye-Service as Men plea&s;ers, but as the Servants of Christ, doing the Will of God from the Heart; <HI>with good Will doing Service.</HI> Eph. 6.5, &mdash;7. Their Service mu&s;t not be meerly of Con&s;traint, but from good Will and a Principle of Love to their Ma&s;ters. They mu&s;t regard their Ma|&s;ters Intere&s;ts &s;omething as their own, and &s;o promote them by their hone&s;t diligent Labour. Thus there ought to be mutual Affection between <HI>Civil Rulers,</HI> and the <HI>People</HI> under their Government. Rulers ought to lay out them&s;elves in promoting the public Weal. They mu&s;t be the Mini&s;ters of God for good to their People, and u&s;e their be&s;t Endeavours that they may be exten&s;ive Ble&s;&s;ings, as the Light and Rain of Hea|ven. And the People &s;hould chearfully return that
<PB N="10" REF="005056_0008_101692B841D02068">
Honour and Obedience, Tribute and Recompence which are their Due; and do their Part by their hear|ty Re&s;pect and dutiful Deportment to make the Burden Of Government as ea&s;y to their Rulers as may be. I might go on, and &s;ay that there is al&s;o a peculiar Love to be exerci&s;ed towards &s;uch as are related to us upon a <HI>religious Account,</HI> and by the Bonds of Grace. <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> &s;hould feed their <HI>Flocks</HI> with tender Care and Affecti|on, being willing to &s;pend and be &s;pent for them, tho' the more abundantly they love them, the le&s;s they be loved. And their <HI>People</HI> &s;hould highly e&s;teem them in Love for their Work's &s;ake. Such as are <HI>united in Church-Fellow&s;hip</HI> &s;hould watch over one another in Love, not for their halting, but &s;piritual Edification; rejoicing in the Pro&s;perity of each other's Souls. Such as are Brethren in Christ &s;hould love each other from a pure Heart, fervently. The Saints &s;hould in our E&s;teem be the excellent ones of the Earth, and we &s;hould place our Affection in an e&s;pecial Manner upon tho&s;e in whom the Image of God &s;hineth with the brighte&s;t Lu&s;tre. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 16. 3. <HI>To the Saints that are in the Earth, and to the excellent in whom is all my delight.</HI> Our Love mu&s;t be <HI>exten&s;ive,</HI> and as we have Oppor|tunity, we <HI>mu&s;t do good to all Men;</HI> but then here it mu&s;t be more <HI>inten&s;e,</HI> and we mu&s;t accordingly <HI>do good e&s;pecially to them who are of the Hou&s;hold of Faith,</HI> Gal. 6. 10. And thus I have briefly an&s;wer'd the fir&s;t In|quiry; who is our Neighbour?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>What is implied in loving our Neighbour?</HI> Or, <HI>What is this Love?</HI></P>
<P>An&s;w <HI>This Love is a gracious Affection, by which we truly de&s;ire, &s;eek and rejoice in the Welfare of our Neigh|bour, and that in Obedience to GOD's Command.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>This Love to our Neighbour is a gracious Affec|tion.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="005056_0009_101692BAF0F13C60">It is not meerly a natural Pa&s;&s;ion. No, this Affec|tion mu&s;t be &s;anctified by the Holy Spirit of God. <HI>The Fruit of the Spirit is Love,</HI> Gal. 5. 22. Not only Love to God, but al&s;o to our Neighbour. We mu&s;t be made Partakers of the divine Teaching, that we may obey this Command. 1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 4. 9. <HI>Ye your &s;elves are taught of GOD to love one another.</HI> God writes this Law of Love upon the Heart when his People are born again, born of the Spirit. Thus &s;ays the beloved Di&s;ciple <HI>John,</HI> 1 Ep. 4. 7. <HI>Beloved, let us love one another: For Love is of GOD; and every one that lo|veth, is born of GOD.</HI> Alas! by our Fall this Affecti|on is dreadfully deprav'd, &s;o that Men inordinately love them&s;elves, and are full of Malice and Envy to|wards their Neighbour. We have that De&s;cription of the natural Man de&s;titute of the Grace of the Go&s;pel, <HI>Tit.</HI> 3. 3. <HI>Living in Malice and Envy, hateful, and ha|ting one another.</HI> So it was till the Kindne&s;s and Love of God our Saviour towards Man appear'd, and they <HI>were &s;aved by the wa&s;hing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> 4th and 5th Ver&s;es.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) This Love is exerci&s;ed in Obedience to GOD's Command.</P>
<P>God's Commandment is, <HI>Thou &s;halt love thy Neigh|bour as thy &s;elf.</HI> The Command of our Redeemer, God-Man Mediator is that, <HI>Love one another.</HI> Now he that loveth his Neighbour, hath a &s;incere Re&s;pect to the Divine Command, as the Cau&s;e, Rule and Mea|&s;ure of his Love to his Neighbour. He loveth his Brother becau&s;e the great Lawgiver requireth it, for the Lord's &s;ake, who is the chief Good; and with an upright Aim at his Glory, who is the la&s;t and highe&s;t End. He loves the Di&s;ciples of Christ upon the Account of their Relation to him, and becau&s;e he re|quireth them to love one another. In a Word, &s;uch as truly love their Neighbour, endeavour to regulate
<PB N="12" REF="005056_0010_101692BCE9E81E70">
their Love, the inward Affection and outward Expre&s;|&s;ions of it, by the Rule of GOD'S Word. Whereas, tho' wicked Men may have a &s;trong Affection towards their Children and Friends; yet they have not a &s;in|cere Re&s;pect to GOD's Law as the Rea&s;on and Mea|&s;ure of their Love: But indeed they forget GOD, while they make an Idol of the Creature.</P>
<P N="3">(3) In the Exerci&s;e of this Love <HI>we &s;incerely de&s;ire the Good and Welfare of our Neighbour.</HI></P>
<P>When we con&s;ider'd the Love of GOD, we menti|oned our de&s;iring him above all; for He is infinitely glorious, and altogether lovely; and there's no Room for us &s;o much as to wi&s;h him more excellent and happy than He is in him&s;elf. But our Neighbour is like our &s;elves, a needy imperfect dependent Creature: And therefore we may not de&s;ire him above all, or place our Happine&s;s in him; but then we mu&s;t de&s;ire his Good: There mu&s;t be a Love of Benevolence, of good Will exerci&s;ed towards him. We mu&s;t be well affected towards him, and heartily wi&s;h that his out|ward Man, and more e&s;pecially that his Soul may pro&s;per. And we mu&s;t be ready as there may be Oc|ca&s;ion to expre&s;s our De&s;ires and good Wi&s;hes in hearty Prayer to GOD for him, e&s;pecially for the Sal|vation of his Soul. 3 Joh. 2. <HI>Beloved, I wi&s;h above all Things that thou may&s;t pro&s;per and be in Health, even as thy Soul pro&s;pereth.</HI> This is a genuine Fruit of Love, and will be accepted of GOD, even when we are able, to do but little for our Neighbour. <HI>Prov.</HI> 19. 22. <HI>The De&s;ire of a Man is his Kindne&s;s: and a poor Man is better than a Liar.</HI> A Man may expre&s;s real Kindne&s;s in good De&s;ires: And &s;uch as breath out their good Wi&s;hes for GOD's People in frequent and fervent Pray|ers, are indeed public Ble&s;&s;ings, tho' ever &s;o mean and ob&s;cure in the World. But then we mu&s;t take heed we be not as the <HI>Liar</HI> in the Text but now mentioned,
<PB N="13" REF="005056_0011_101692BEACDA19F8">
who pretends Love, but will be at no Pains and Co&s;t to &s;hew it by his good Works, when he is well able.</P>
<P N="4">(4) In the Exerci&s;e of this Love, <HI>we &s;eek our Neigh|bour's Good, and avoid whatever would hurt him.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1 Joh. 3. 18. <HI>Let us not love in Word, neither in Tongue, but in Deed and in Truth.</HI> As true Love de&s;i|reth the Good of others, &s;o it will incline us to endea|vour it, and as we have Ability and Opportunity, to promote it. In the 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. among other excellent Characters of Charity or Love, we have that, 5th ver. <HI>Charity &s;eeketh not her own.</HI> Not what is for our own Good only; but al&s;o the Profit and Advantage of others. And therefore he that hath this Grace in due Exerci&s;e, will obey that Command, 1 Cor. 10. 24. <HI>Let no Man &s;eek his own: but every Man another's Wealth.</HI> We mu&s;t &s;eek the Wealth of our Neighbour in Trade and Commerce, as well as our Own; and take heed we do not over-reach and defraud him. That mu&s;t be a vicious Self-love indeed which would en|gro&s;s all Advantage and Profit to it&s;elf. Love will incline Per&s;ons to &s;eek the Good of their Neighbours on &s;piritual and temporal Accounts. He that duly exerci&s;eth this Grace will regard the Soul of his Bro|ther, his better part. He will as he hath Opportunity &s;eek his Conver&s;ion to GOD, knowing that he which converteth a Sinner from the Error of his Way, &s;hall &s;ave a Soul from Death. He will al&s;o &s;eek his Edifi|cation in Holine&s;s by his In&s;tructions, Exhortations, Coun&s;els, and the like, as he is able, and his Neigh|bour's Circum&s;tances call for them. If he beholds his Brother fallen into Sin, he will mourn for it. <HI>Charity rejoiceth not in Iniquity.</HI> And in&s;tead of going about to expo&s;e him, he will rather &s;eek to re&s;tore him with a Spirit of Meekne&s;s, by brotherly Admonition and Reproof. Lev. 19. 17. <HI>Thou &s;halt not hate thy Bro|ther in thine Heart: Thou &s;halt in any wi&s;e rebuke thy
<PB N="14" REF="005056_0012_101692C4F592B0F0">
Neighbour, and not &s;uffer Sin upon him.</HI> And then the Fruit of Love will be a &s;incere Endeavour to promote the outward Good of our Neighbour: Love would incline us to pity him under his Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and to do what we can to relieve and &s;uccour him. <HI>Job</HI> 6. 14. <HI>To him that is afflicted Pity &s;hould be &s;hewed from his Friend.</HI> If our Neighbour be poor, Love will open our Hearts and Hands to relieve him: In the Exerci&s;e of this Grace we &s;hall <HI>draw out our Soul to the hungry, and &s;atisfy the afflicted Soul.</HI> True Love is beneficent and communicative. And then, where there is this lovely Grace in any due Exerci&s;e, we &s;hall carefully avoid whatever would hurt and injure our Neighbour, re|&s;pecting his Life, his Cha&s;tity, his E&s;tate, good Name, and the like. <HI>Charity thinketh no Evil.</HI> Such will not be forward to entertain evil Surmi&s;es and hard Tho'ts of their Neighbour; but will rather be ready to put the mo&s;t favourable Con&s;truction on their Words and Actions which the Matter will bear. To be &s;ure then they will not go about as Tale-bearers and Backbiters to &s;ow Di&s;cord between Brethren, and privily to wound their Neighbour. Rom. 13. 10. <HI>Love worketh no ill to his Neighbour.</HI> This excellent Grace is pure and peaceable, and will incline us to follow Peace, &s;uch as is con&s;i&s;tent with Truth and Holine&s;s. Rom. 12. 18. <HI>If it be po&s;&s;ible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all Men.</HI> Again, as Charity is not ea&s;ily provo|ked; &s;o it is early in &s;eeking Reconciliation, and doth not meditate Revenge. They obey that Word, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4. 31, 32. <HI>Let all Bitterne&s;s, and Wrath, and Anger, and Clamour, and evil &s;peaking be put far away from you, with all Malice. And be ye kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, even as GOD for CHRIST's &s;ake hath forgiven you.</HI> In a Word, where this Grace rules in the Heart, we &s;hall avoid every thing whereby our Brother is offended, or is made weak; and &s;hall endeavour &s;o to behave in our &s;everal
<PB N="15" REF="005056_0013_101692C6A1AE5468">
Places and Relations, that &s;uch as are near to us may be the better for us, and none have Rea&s;on to mourn becau&s;e we are nigh to them in this or the other Re|lation.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) In the Exerci&s;e of Love <HI>we rejoice in the Good and Welfare of our Neighbour.</HI></P>
<P>There is a Delight in his Per&s;on &s;o far as he is truly lovely, and according to the Relation we &s;tand in to|wards him; which is a Duty: But I now mention that which is more general. True Love will incline us to be well affected to our Neighbour, and not allow us to have an evil Eye towards him, becau&s;e GOD is good to him. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. 4. <HI>Charity envieth not.</HI> It is true, there are the Remains of Corruption in the be&s;t, which incline them to lu&s;t unto Envy; but then &s;o far as this Grace prevails, it will &s;uppre&s;s the&s;e evil Motions, and cau&s;e us to rejoice in the Good of our Neighbour. He that &s;incerely loveth his Brother, will obey that Command, <HI>Rom.</HI> 12. 15. <HI>Rejoice with them that do rejoice.</HI> Such will feel an holy Joy, e&s;pecially in the &s;piritual Welfare and Pro&s;perity of others. 3 Joh. 4. <HI>I have no greater Joy than to hear that my Children walk in the Truth.</HI> A kind and charitable Spirit takes Plea&s;ure in the Good of others, and rejoiceth in the Eminency of their Gifts and Graces, in their U&s;eful|ne&s;s, their Reputation, &amp;c. O that GOD would give, and then increa&s;e this excellent Spirit in us! Thus the good Things our Neighbour enjoys, will in a Sen&s;e be made our own.

<P N="2">II. <HI>This is the &s;econd Commandment, and it is like unto the fir&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;econd is like unto it. &mdash; The&s;e Words refer to that which went before.

<P N="1">1. This is GOD's Commandment.</P>
<P>The Love of our Neighbour is a great Duty requi|red in the Moral Law, and it is enforced under the Go&s;pel. Agreeably in different Re&s;pects it is called both an old, and a new Commandment. 1 <HI>Joh,</HI> 2. 7, 8. <HI>Brethren, I write no new Commandment unto you, but an old Commandment which ye had from the begin|ning: The old Commandment is the Word which ye have beard from the beginning. Again, a new Commandment

Joh. 13. 34. <HI>A new Command|ment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye al&s;o love one another.</HI> We have a new and fair Edition of this Law under the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation, delivered from the corrupt Glo&s;&s;es of the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees:</HI> It is explain'd under the New|Te&s;tament, and enforc'd by a new and divine Example of our great Lord, who loved us, and gave him&s;elf for us, and hath made this one peculiar Badge and Character of his true Di&s;ciples, that they love one ano|ther. <HI>Joh.</HI> 13. 35. <HI>By this &s;hall all Men know that ye are my Di&s;ciples, if ye have Love one to another.</HI> But it would be to tran&s;cribe a con&s;iderable Part of the New-Te&s;tament to name all the Texts that relate to this Duty. 1 Joh. 3. 23. <HI>And this is his commandment, that we &s;hould believe on the Name of his Son JESUS CHRIST, and love one another, as he gave us Command|ment.</HI> I proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>This is the &s;econd Commandment, and ii is like unto the fir&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>It is the &s;econd in Order, and al&s;o in Dignity; as it comprehends the Duties which re&s;pect our Neigh|bour. GOD mu&s;t be loved in the fir&s;t and chief Place, and for him&s;elf: Our Neighbour mu&s;t be loved for His &s;ake, and in Subordination to him who requires this of us. Accordingly the Duties which nextly re|&s;pect GOD, are to be &s;et before tho&s;e which nextly re|&s;pect our Neighbour. We mu&s;t prefer the <HI>religious Wor&s;hip</HI> of GOD to the <HI>civil Re&s;pect</HI> due to Men. However, there are In&s;tances in which by GOD's own
<PB N="22" REF="005056_0020_101692DA41424FB8">
Appointment, &s;ome le&s;&s;er Duties of the fir&s;t Table mu&s;t give Place to &s;ome principal Duties of the &s;econd Ta|ble. <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 6. 6. <HI>I de&s;ired Mercy, and not Sacrifice.</HI> And &s;uch is the conde&s;cending Goodne&s;s of God to us, that He will have &s;ome Acts of religious Wor&s;hip omitted for this or that Time, when our Neighbour's Nece&s;&s;ity requires our pre&s;ent Help; rather than that he &s;hould &s;uffer. e. g. If our Neighbour's Hou&s;e take Fire on the Lord's Day, God will have us &s;hew Mercy to him by affording him our needed Help un|der the pre&s;ent Difficulty, rather than to attend his public Wor&s;hip for that Time. Behold the tender Mercy of our great Lord and Lawgiver! Surely his Commands are not grievous. But to return. Tho' there be Inequality, yet the &s;econd Command is like unto the fir&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>As it is a divine Command.</HI></P>
<P>Both alike bear the Stamp of the Divine Authority. If we neglect the Duties of the &s;econd Table, we not only injure Men; but we al&s;o affront and offend the glorious God by breaking His Law. And herein doth the great Evil of Sin con&s;i&s;t. Agreeably, when <HI>David</HI> had greatly wronged <HI>Uriah</HI> by his Adultery and Murder, he makes that Con&s;e&s;&s;ion before God, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 51. 4. <HI>Again&s;t thee, thee only have I &s;inned, and done this Evil in thy Sight.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>This Command is very comprehen&s;ive like the fir&s;t.</HI> It contains the Sum and Sub&s;tance of the &s;ix Com|mandments which re&s;pect our Duty towards our Neigh|bour. <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. 8, 9. <HI>Owe no Man any thing, but to love one another: For he that loveth another hath fulfilled the Law. For this, Thou &s;halt not commit Adultery, Thou &s;halt not kill, Thou &s;halt not &s;teal, Thou &s;halt not bear fal&s;e Witne&s;s, Thou &s;halt not covet; and if there be any other Commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this</HI>

<P N="3">3. <HI>This Command is in a Sen&s;e founded on the fir&s;t; &s;o that neither can be kept in a due Manner, if either be neglected.</HI></P>
<P>There is &s;uch a clo&s;e Connection between them, that if one be violated, the other can't be duly ob&s;erved. He that doth not obey the fir&s;t Command, by loving God in Sincerity; will not keep the &s;econd, by loving his Neighbour. 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 4. 21. <HI>And this Commandment have we from him, that he who loveth GOD, love his Brother al&s;o.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The Love of our Neighbour &s;hall never fail; but be for ever perfected in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Love to our Neighbour will never fail, no more than Love to God. Indeed every Grace &s;hall be per|fect in Heaven. But then, when Faith and Hope which are &s;o eminently u&s;eful in this State of Trial, &s;hall cea&s;e as to &s;ome principal Exerci&s;e and Opera|tion; the People of God being brought to the open Vi&s;ion, and full Enjoyment of Him for ever: I &s;ay when it is thus, then Love to our Neighbour, like our Love to God, &s;hall be perfected for ever as to its highe&s;t Exerci&s;e and fulle&s;t Operation.</P>
<P>In a Word, In both the&s;e Commands Love is re|quired, and that in Perfection; &s;o as to comprehend the whole of Duty which we owe fir&s;t to God, and then to our Neighbour according to His Will. Indeed our Love to God mu&s;t va&s;tly exceed, as the Object is in|finitely great and good; but then our Love to our Neighbour here required is commen&s;urate to all the Duty we owe him. And when this Grace is perfected in Heaven, there will not be the lea&s;t Complaint of any Defect in relative Duties. All the glorified Inha|bitants of the heavenly <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> will be united for ever in perfect Love, without Jar or Di&s;cord. O

The Law of God is the Law of Love, and therefore an ea&s;y Yoke and mo&s;t plea&s;ant. How delightful is it to love, and be beloved! It is true, this Law of Love is grievous to corrupt Nature; but when Sin the Plague of the Heart is perfectly taken away, and the original Rectitude in which Man was at fir&s;t made, re&s;tored; then it will be found that our Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts very much in the Exerci&s;e of Love. When Love is perfected in Hea|ven, our Enjoyment will be full. <HI>GOD is Love; and he that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in GOD, and GOD in him,</HI> 1 Joh. 4. 16.

Thus did the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> and our Lord de|nounceth his Judgment again&s;t them, <HI>Matth.</HI> 23. 14. <HI>Wo unto you, Scribes and Phari&s;ees, Hypocrites; for ye devour Widows Hou&s;es, and for a Pretence make long Prayers; therefore ye &s;hall receive the greater Damna|tion.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Let what hath been &s;aid <HI>deeply humble us, and &s;hew us Nece&s;&s;ity of depending on JESUS CHRIST, the End of the Law for Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="005056_0025_101692E5CE20E9B0">We have Rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed when we con&s;ider how far we fall &s;hort of our Duty towards our Neigh|bour, and may well conclude that we cannot be ju&s;ti|fied by the Deeds of the Law. We read, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.24, <HI>The Law was our School Ma&s;ter to bring us unto CHRIST, that we might be ju&s;tified by Faith.</HI> GOD's Commandment to us is, <HI>Thou &s;halt love thy Neighbour as thy &s;elf.</HI> But whoever kept this Law in &s;inle&s;s Per|fection &s;ince the Fall? Surely none but the Man CHRIST JESUS, who is the LORD our Righteou&s;|ne&s;s. Let us then go out to CHRIST, and depend entirely upon him for Ju&s;tification before GOD. And let it greatly aba&s;e us to con&s;ider of our many and great Defects re&s;pecting our Duty towards our Neigh|bour.</P>

<P>If we are born of GOD, we do &s;incerely love our Neighbour, tho' not in &s;inle&s;s Perfection. 1 Joh. 3.14. <HI>We know that we have pa&s;&s;ed from Death unto Life, becau&s;e we love the Brethren.</HI> Let us then a&s;k our &s;elves &s;uch Que<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ons as the&s;e. Do we heartily de&s;ire the Welfare of our Neighbour? Do we expre&s;s the&s;e De&s;ires by a &s;tudious Care and Endeavour to do good to our Neighbour in our &s;veral Places, as we have Ability and Opportunity? And do we &s;incerely rejoice in the Good which others receive from GOD, and in the Good which they do to their Fellow-Creatures? Is it our Burden when we find our Corruptions incli|ning us to lu&s;t unto Envy; and do we by the Grace of GOD &s;eek the De&s;truction of this accur&s;ed Di&s;po&s;i|tion in us? Let us take heed le&s;t we think our &s;elves &s;omething upon this Account, when indeed we are no|thing, deceiving our own &s;elves.</P>
