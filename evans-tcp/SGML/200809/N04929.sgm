<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;aying they had no Objection to this, <HI>Andrew Montour</HI> &s;aid he was now going to &s;peak for the <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> living at <HI>Ohio.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren, the Governor of</HI> Penn&s;ylvania, <HI>and all the Governors of the great King of</HI> England, <HI>over the Seas</HI>;</P>
<P>You have often &s;ent pre&s;&s;ing Me&s;&s;ages to the Council Fire at <HI>Onondago,</HI> to engage in your Intere&s;t as many of their Allies as they could influence: The&s;e Me&s;&s;ages they have tran&s;mitted to us, de&s;iring we would take all Opportuni|ties of complying with your Reque&s;t; in Con&s;equence whereof we have now the Plea&s;ure to pre&s;ent to you &s;ome of the Chiefs of the <HI>Twightwee</HI> Nation, a large and powerful Tribe, living on <HI>Ouabache,</HI> a great River running into <HI>Ohio,</HI> who come as Deputies &s;ent by the whole Nation, with a Reque&s;t that you would be plea&s;ed to admit them into your Amity. We join with them in the Petition; take their Hands, and let them, together with ours, be lock'd clo&s;e in yours, and there held fa&s;t: We have opened unto you the Occa&s;ion of our Vi&s;it; and to make it acceptable, we lay down this String of Wam|pum.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> Onas, <HI>and all King of</HI> England's <HI>Governors.</HI></P>
<P>It will be nece&s;&s;ary to lay before you what has pa&s;&s;ed between the <HI>Twigh|twees</HI> and us, previous to our coming here, that you may be &s;en&s;ible of our Zeal for your Service, and of the ardent De&s;ire of that Nation to enter into your Alliance.</P>
<P>La&s;t Fall they &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age addre&s;&s;ed to all the Tribes of <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Ohio</HI> and el&s;ewhere, in Amity with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> which was delivered to the <HI>Shawo|ne&s;e,</HI> as living the neare&s;t to them, and by them communicated to us to this Effect.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P><Q>We, the <HI>Twightwees,</HI> are de&s;irous to enter into the Chain of Friend&s;hip with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; and as you are the next to us of the <HI>Indians</HI> in their Al|liance, we entreat you to &s;ignify this our De&s;ire to the other <HI>Indians,</HI> and 
<PB N="3" REF="006169_0006_1027FEBDF2699FD8">
that you and they will open us a Council Road to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Govern|ments: Make it &s;o open and clear for us, that neither we, nor our Wives or Children, may hurt their Feet again&s;t any Log or Stump; and when once you have cleared a Road for us, we a&s;&s;ure you we will keep it &s;o, and it &s;hall not be in the Power of <HI>Onontio</HI> to block up or ob&s;truct the Pa&s;&s;age. We further de&s;ire of you, that when you have cleared a Council Road for us to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> you, and the other <HI>Indians,</HI> will join your In|tere&s;t to recommend us in the mo&s;t effectual Manner to them to be admit|ted into their Chain.</Q> Upon receipt of this Me&s;&s;age from the <HI>Twightwees,</HI> the following An&s;wer was &s;ent them.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren, the</HI> Twightwees,</P>
<Q>We received your String of Wampum expre&s;&s;ing your De&s;ire to enter in|to Friend&s;hip with our Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and praying our A&s;&s;i&s;tance to obtain this for you. We are glad you are in this Di&s;po&s;ition, and wou'd by all Means encourage you in it; but we are afraid le&s;t you &s;hould have taken this Re&s;olution too ha&s;tily. Are you Proof again&s;t the Solicitations that the Governor of <HI>Canada</HI> and his People will certainly u&s;e to engage your Adherence to him? Can you with&s;tand his Re&s;entment? Con&s;ider this well, le&s;t when we &s;hall have recommended you to our Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> you &s;hou'd prove un&s;teady, and &s;o we &s;hou'd lo&s;e their E&s;teem. Take, therefore, we urge you, Time to con&s;ider, and let us know your Mind, and we will give you all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance in our Power.</Q>
<P>The <HI>Twightwees</HI> having received this An&s;wer, &s;ent in the Spring a &s;econd Me&s;&s;age, addre&s;&s;ed to all the <HI>Indians</HI> on <HI>Ohio</HI> in Alliance with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> to this purport:</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q>Our Me&s;&s;age in the Fall was not &s;ent ra&s;hly or unadvi&s;edly. We thought many Nights and Days of this Affair. We weighed every Thing well relating thereto before we took the Re&s;olution of &s;eeking the Friend|&s;hip of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and we now repeat to you our A&s;&s;urances, that this Reque&s;t does not come from the Mouth only; no, it comes from the Heart, and is what we ardently wi&s;h to accompli&s;h; and that we may not fail of Succe&s;s, we de&s;ire your A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and that of all the <HI>Indians</HI> in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Chain, to help us to obtain this Favour; and particularly we de|&s;ire &s;ome of you will go along with us, and pre&s;ent us to <HI>Onas.</HI></Q>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We have now faithfuly related what pa&s;&s;ed between the <HI>Twightwees</HI> and us. We deliver over to you the Strings of Wampum which we received with their Me&s;&s;ages. Their Nation has &s;ent thirty Beaver Skins, which we de&s;ire you would accept; and now be plea&s;ed to hear what their Deputies have to &s;ay.</P>
<P><HI>Here were laid down two Strings of Wampum, and 30 Beaver Skins.</HI></P>
<P>Then <HI>Andrew Montour</HI> acquainted the Commi&s;&s;ioners, that he was now going to be the Mouth of the <HI>Twightwee</HI> Deputies.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We pre&s;ent to you the Calumet Pipe, and pray we may be admitted to be|come a Link in your Chain of Friend&s;hip, and give you the &s;tronge&s;t A&s;&s;u|rances, 
<PB N="4" REF="006169_0007_1027FEBF79D03390">
if this Favour be granted to us, that we will keep it bright as long as the Rivers run.</P>
<P><HI>Here the Deputies laid down a Calumet Pipe, with a long Stem, curi|ou&s;ly wrought, and wrapp'd round with Wampum of &s;everal Colours, and fill'd with Tobacco, which was &s;moked by the Commi&s;&s;ioners and the</HI> Indians <HI>according to Cu&s;tom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We the Deputies of the <HI>Twightwees,</HI> have it in Charge further to tell you, that our Nation received a Calumet Pipe from &s;ome of the Allies, con&s;i&s;ting of twelve Towns or Nations, with a Me&s;&s;age to this Effect: That they had a Report among them that we intended to &s;olicit the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to be received into their Friend&s;hip and Alliance: That if &s;uch Report was true, they de&s;ired us to acquaint them with our Succe&s;s, that they might apply for the &s;ame Favour, which they earne&s;tly de&s;ire, and &s;aid they would wait a Day and a Night for an An&s;wer.
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>N. B.</HI> A day and a Night in the <HI>Indian</HI> Language &s;ignifics a whole Year.</NOTE> Then the Deputies offered another Pipe to the Commi&s;&s;ioners, not to keep, but that they might &s;peak to it, and return it, with their An&s;wer.</P>
<P><HI>Andrew Montour</HI> &s;aid he was now going to re&s;ume the Speech of the <HI>Six Nation Indians</HI> at <HI>Ohio.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You have now heard the <HI>Twightwees</HI> &s;peak for them&s;elves. We heartily join with them in their Petition. They are numerous, and, tho' poor, yet they are worthy of your Friend&s;hip, and, as &s;uch we mo&s;t heartily recommend them to you by this Bundle of Skins.</P>
<P><HI>Here they laid down a Bundle of Deer Skins.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We beg Leave before we conclude to become Interce&s;&s;ors for the <HI>Shaw|ne&s;e,</HI> who have given you ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Complaint. They have told us, that the Governor of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> &s;ent them a Letter &s;ome Years ago, requiring them to come down; but being con&s;cious they had acted wrong, they had de|lay'd hitherto to do it; and have taken this Opportunity of our coming, to make u&s;e of us; de&s;iring us to a&s;k that for them which they dare not a&s;k for them&s;elves; that is, That they may be receiv'd again into Favour, they ha|ving owned their Fault, and given us the &s;tronge&s;t A&s;&s;urances of their better Behaviour for the future. Forgive us, therefore, if we entreat you would be pleas'd to drop your Re&s;entment; and however they have behav'd hitherto, we hope a Sen&s;e of your Goodne&s;s will prevail with them to become good and faithful Allies for the future.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String of Wampum.</HI></P>

<Q>We the <HI>Shawone&s;e</HI> have been mi&s;led, and have carried on a private Cor|re&s;pondence with the <HI>French,</HI> without letting you, or our Brethren, the <HI>En|gli&s;h,</HI> know of it.

<P><HI>Brethren of the</HI> Six Nations, <HI>And others, living at</HI> Ohio,</P>
<P>It gives us no &s;mall Satisfaction to ob&s;erve the Regard you have &s;hewn to the Me&s;&s;ages &s;ent you by the Governors of his Maje&s;ty's Provinces, in en|deavouring to gain over to His Maje&s;ty's Intere&s;t as many of your Allies as you cou'd influence: This is agreable to your Duty, and was recommended to you in a particular Manner by the Governor of this Province at the Com|mencement of the <HI>French</HI> War. As the <HI>Twightwees</HI> &s;hew'd &s;o great an In|clination to enter into our Friend&s;hip, and de&s;ir'd you to conduct them hither, the Part you have acted on this Occa&s;ion was kind and prudent, and we think our&s;elves oblig'd to you for encouraging them, and &s;hewing them the Way.</P>
<P>Our Approbation of your Conduct is te&s;tified by this String of Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As there is Rea&s;on to think from the Manner in which the <HI>Twightwees</HI> have made their Application for a Council Road to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Provinces, that it is not a &s;udden, or a ha&s;ty Step, but well con&s;ider'd by them, and may take its Ri&s;e from the different Treatment which <HI>Indians</HI> of all Nations meet with at the Hands of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> from what they experience while in the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t, we are inclinable to think them &s;incere, and that when admitted in|to our Chain, they will not lightly break it.</P>
<P>A Council Road to this Province is a Mea&s;ure which nearly concerns you, as it is to be laid out thro' your Towns, and no doubt you have thought well of this, and conceive you may depend on the Sincerity of their Profe&s;&s;ions, and that it may be for our mutual Benefit, or you wou'd not join with them in making this Reque&s;t. At your In&s;tance therefore, and from the Opinion we have of your Prudence and Integrity, we con&s;ent that &s;uch Road may be opened; and it may be depended on, that on our Parts it will always be kept clean; not the lea&s;t Ob&s;truction &s;hall be &s;uffer'd to remain in it. In Confir|mation whereof</P>
<P>We give this String of Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren of the</HI> Twightwee <HI>Nation,</HI></P>
<P>At the Interce&s;&s;ion of our good Friends and Allies the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> we have granted you a Council Road, whereby you have free Acce&s;s to any of His Maje&s;ty's Provinces; we admit you into our Friend&s;hip and Alli|ance, and therefore now call you BRETHREN, an Appellation which we hold &s;acred, and in which is included every Thing that is dear. It obliges us to give you A&s;&s;i&s;tance on all Occa&s;ions, to exerci&s;e unfeign'd Affection towards you, to take you into our Bo&s;oms, to u&s;e our Eyes, and Ears, and Hands, as well for you, as for our&s;elves. Nothing is put in Competition by an <HI>Engli&s;h|man</HI> with the Faith and Honour due to tho&s;e whom our gracious King plea&s;es to take into his Protection, admit into his Chain of Friend&s;hip, and make them our Fellow Subjects: From that Moment they become our own Fle&s;h and Blood, and what hurts them will equally hurt us. Do you, on your Parts, look upon this important Name of Brethren in the &s;ame Light; You mu&s;t no more think of <HI>Onontio,</HI> and his <HI>Children</HI>; all that &s;ort of Relation|&s;hip now cea&s;es; His Maje&s;ty's Friends are your Friends, and His Maje&s;ty's

Enemies are Your Enemies. On the&s;e Conditions we accept your Calumet Pipe, and &s;hall lay it up very carefully, that it may be always ready for U&s;e when you and we come together. In Token of our Readine&s;s to receive you into our Chain of Friend&s;hip, we pre&s;ent you</P>
<P>With this double Belt of Wampum, as an Emblem of our Union.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren of the</HI> Twigthwee <HI>Nation,</HI></P>
<P>We under&s;tand that by an antient Cu&s;tom ob&s;erv'd by your Ance&s;tors, the Delivery and Acceptance of the Calumet Pipe are the Ceremonies which render valid, and bind fa&s;t your Alliances: We mu&s;t now tell you what our U&s;ages are on the&s;e Occa&s;ions. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> when they con&s;ent to take any Nation into their Alliance, draw up a Compact in Writing, which is faith|fully intepreted to the contracting Parties, and when maturely con&s;ider'd, and clearly and fully under&s;tood by each Side, their A&s;&s;ent is declar'd in the mo&s;t publick Manner, and the Stipulation render'd authentick by &s;ealing the In|&s;trument with Seals, whereon are engraven their Families Arms, writing their Names, and publi&s;hing it as their Act and Deed, done without Force or Con&s;traint, freely and voluntarily. This is the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Method of rati|fying Treaties; this is the grand Security each gives of his Faith; and our Brethren of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> the <HI>Delawares, Shawone&s;e,</HI> and all other <HI>Indian</HI> Nations, when they fir&s;t enter'd into the Chain of Friend&s;hip with us, execu|ted In&s;truments of this Nature; and as you are now one People with us, in the &s;ame Manner with all other of our <HI>Indian</HI> Allies, it will be expected by this, and His Maje&s;ty's other Governments, that you will do the &s;ame. For your Satisfaction we now &s;hew you &s;ome of the Deeds that the <HI>Indians</HI> exe|cuted when they fir&s;t enter'd into our Alliance.</P>
<P><HI>Brethern, Deputies of the</HI> Twigtwees,</P>
<P>You &s;ay &s;ome of your Allies having heard of your Intentions to apply for Admittance into the Friend&s;hip and Alliance with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> de&s;ired you to acquaint them with the Succe&s;s of &s;uch Application, to the End that they might have an Opportunity of a&s;king the &s;ame Favour. As we don't know the Names of tho&s;e of your Allies, their Number or Situation, we cannot be more particular at pre&s;ent on this Head, than to tell you, that we are always ready to receive favourably the Applications of all tho&s;e whom our Brethren of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> &s;hall recommend as worthy of our Friend&s;hip and Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d.</P>
<P>In Te&s;timony whereof we have wrapped a String of Wampum round the Calumet Pipe &s;ent by your Allies.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren of the</HI> Six Nations, &amp;c. at Ohio,</P>
<P>You perceive that at your Reque&s;t we have received the <HI>Twightwees</HI> into our Friend&s;hip: We take kindly your conducting them to us for that End; and as a Proof of our being well plea&s;ed with your Cond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t on this Occa&s;ion, we have ordered our Interpreter to deliver to you at Mr. <HI>Croghan</HI>'s &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods, that are lodged there for the u&s;e of the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>Brethren,</P>
<P>Your Interce&s;&s;ion for the <HI>Shawone&s;e</HI> puts us under Difficulties. It is at lea&s;t two Years &s;ince the Governor of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> wrote to <HI>Cackewatcheka</HI> a Let|ter, wherein he conde&s;cended, out of regard to him, and a few other <HI>Shawo|ne&s;e,</HI> who pre&s;erved their Fidelity, to offer tho&s;e who broke the Chain a Par|don on their Submi&s;&s;ion, on their Return to the Towns they had de&s;erted, 
<PB N="8" REF="006169_0011_1027DB0783B52C48">
and on their coming down to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> to evidence in Per&s;on the Sincerity of their Repentance. This they &s;hould have immediately complied with, and they would have readily been admitted into Favour; but as they did not do it, what can be &s;aid for them? You who live among&s;t them be&s;t know their Di&s;po&s;itions, and wou'd not, it may be hoped, become Mediators for them, were you not per&s;uaded they wou'd return to their Duty. Some of them, it may be allowed, are weak People, and were preverted from their Duty by the Per&s;wa&s;ions of others; but this cannot be thought to be the Ca&s;e of <HI>Neucheconno,</HI> and a few more. As therefore you have taken upon you the Office of Interce&s;&s;ors, take this String of Wampum, and therewith cha&s;ti&s;e <HI>Neucheconno</HI> and his Party in &s;uch Terms as &s;hall carry a proper Severity with them, tho' the Expre&s;&s;ions are left to your Di&s;cretion; and then tell the delin|quent <HI>Shawone&s;e,</HI> that we will forget what is pa&s;s'd, and expect a more punctual Regard to their Engagements hereafter.</P>
<P>Here was deliver'd a String of Wampum.</P>
<P>'Tis but Ju&s;tice to di&s;tingui&s;h the Good from the Bad; <HI>Cackewatcheky</HI> and his Friends, who had Virtue enough to re&s;i&s;t the many fine Promi&s;es made by the Emi&s;&s;aries of the <HI>French,</HI> will ever be remember'd with Gratitude, and challenge our be&s;t Services. To te&s;tify our Regard for the&s;e, we pre&s;ent them with this</P>
<P>Belt of Wampum.</P>
<P>And have order'd our Interpreter, who is going to <HI>Ohio,</HI> to give them a Pre&s;ent of Goods.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners gave a hand&s;ome Entertainment to the Deputies of the <HI>Twightwees,</HI> and the <HI>Indians</HI> who conducted them from <HI>Ohio,</HI> and after Din|ner enter'd into a free Conver&s;ation with them about the Numbers and Situa|tion of their Towns, and tho&s;e of their Allies; and by their Informations it appears that the River <HI>Ouabache</HI> takes its Ri&s;e from a Lake at a &s;mall Di&s;tance from the We&s;t-End of Lake <HI>Eric,</HI> from which it runs South We&s;terly four or 500 Miles, and falls into the <HI>Ohio,</HI> about three hundred Miles from the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi</HI>; that on this River, and another River call'd the <HI>Hatchet,</HI> the <HI>Twightwees</HI> and their Allies have twenty Towns, and that they count One Thou&s;and &s;ighting Men; that it is a plain Country, and of a rich Soil, aboun|ding with Game. The principal Deputy of the <HI>Twightwees</HI> laid down with Chalk the Cour&s;es of the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi,</HI> of <HI>Ouabache</HI> and of <HI>Ohio,</HI> marking the Situation of their own Towns, of Lake <HI>Erie,</HI> and of two Forts that the <HI>French</HI> have on the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi</HI>; whereby it is manife&s;t, that if the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> and their Allies prove faithful to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> will be depriv'd of the mo&s;t convenient and neare&s;t Communication with their Forts on the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi,</HI> the ready Road lying thro' their Nations, and that there will be nothing to interrupt an Intercour&s;e between this Province and that great River.</P>

We have been a fooli&s;h People, and acted wrong, tho' the Sun &s;hone bright, and &s;hew'd us very clearly what was our Duty. We are &s;orry for what we have done, and promi&s;e better Behaviour for the future. We produce to you a Certificate of the Renewal of our Friend&s;hip in the Year 1739 by the Proprietor and Governor. Be plea&s;ed to &s;ign it afre&s;h, that it may appear to the World we are now admitted into your Friend&s;hip, and all former Crimes are buried, and intirely forgot.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners receiv'd the Deed, but re&s;u&s;ed to &s;ign it, letting them know they were forgiven on Condition of better Behaviour for the future; and when they &s;hall have performed that Condition, it will be time enough to apply for &s;uch Te&s;timonials. Orders were given for mending their Guns and Hatchets, and then the <HI>Twightwees</HI> were told that the Secretary was pre|paring an In&s;trument for rendering authentick our Treaty of Friend&s;hip with them, which wou'd be ready at Nine o' Clock in the Morning, to which Time the Commi&s;&s;ioners adjourn'd.</P>
