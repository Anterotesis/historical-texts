<P>&mdash;This we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither &s;hould he eat.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Law of Love is, in a &s;ingular and di&s;tingui&s;h|ing Manner, the Law of Chri&s;tianity. <HI>This is MY Commandment,</HI> &s;ays our Saviour, <HI>that ye love one another.</HI> And again, <HI>A NEW Commandment give I unto you, that ye love one another.</HI> And yet again, <HI>By THIS &s;hall all Men know that ye are my Di&s;ciples, if ye have Love one to another.</HI> And by <HI>this</HI> were the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from other Men, and known to be the Di&s;ciples of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And they di&s;covered their Benevolence, <HI>not in Word only, neither in Tongue, but in Deed and in Truth</HI>; never <HI>forgetting to do good and communicate,</HI> as they had Op|portunity. They did not judge, they could ever do too much, in a Way of Charity, for the Relief of the poor and needy.</P>
<P>And no Inconvenience, one would think, could ari&s;e from the Liberalities in which they abounded. And yet, it was owing to this, in part at lea&s;t, that among tho&s;e who took upon them the Name of Chri&s;tians, there were &s;ome who indulged to <HI>Idlene&s;s</HI>; either not working at all, or not with a becoming Diligence.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="006827_0004_102A5A7885240270">Of this Character there &s;eems to have been a con&s;ider|able Number among the Chri&s;tians at <HI>The&s;&s;alonica.</HI> The extraordinary Charities, common in that Day, might en|courage tho&s;e, who were before di&s;po&s;ed to be idle, to neglect the Bu&s;ine&s;s of their proper Callings. The Hope of having their Wants &s;upplied, by the Bounties of their Chri&s;tian Friends and Neighbours, might in&s;en&s;ibly &s;lacken their Diligence, and betray them into an indolent inactive way of Life.</P>
<P>But, from whatever Cau&s;e it might ari&s;e, <HI>Idlene&s;s</HI> was the Fault too prevalent among the <HI>The&s;&s;alonian</HI> Chri&s;tians. The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;eems to be concerned about it; and is particular in his Care to do whatever might be proper to correct and amend it. And to this Purpo&s;e it was, that, among other Things, he &s;pake the Words of my Text, <HI>This we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither &s;hould he eat.</HI> In di&s;cour&s;ing to which Words I &s;hall en|deavour the following Things.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. I &s;hall &s;ay what may be proper to a&s;certain the true Sen&s;e of the Command, <HI>If any will not work, neither &s;hall he eat.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. I &s;hall mention a few Things, as the Time will al|low, to <HI>ju&s;tify the Wi&s;dom and Rea&s;onablene&s;s of the Command.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>III. And, Finally, I &s;hall <HI>apply</HI> what may be offered to the <HI>Occa&s;ion of our being now together.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">I. I am to explain the Command in my Text, <HI>If any will not work, neither &s;hall he eat.</HI></P>
<P>Some perhaps may think, that it ought to be interpreted <HI>univer&s;ally,</HI> as extending to <HI>all,</HI> the Rich, as well as the Poor; in&s;omuch that they ought neither of them <HI>to eat, if they will not work.</HI> But &s;uch an Interpretation does not fall in with the De&s;ign of the Apo&s;tle in this Place. For he is here &s;peaking, not of tho&s;e who are able, without Labour, to maintain them&s;elves; but of poor People, who, if they won't work, mu&s;t have their Expectations of Relief from the Charities of others.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="006827_0005_102A5A51E9C392F8">Not but that it is a &s;hameful Thing for any <HI>to eat the Bread of Idlene&s;s.</HI> If Per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;s ever &s;o great an Abun|dance, this gives them no Licence to be lazy. They may indeed rea&s;onably exempt them&s;elves from the lower and more &s;ervile Parts of Bu&s;ine&s;s: But &s;till they ought not to be idle. Indulged habitual Idlene&s;s is a Reproach to any Man, whether he be high or low, rich or poor. We were made for Bu&s;ine&s;s. Both our Souls and Bodies are &s;o con|&s;tituted, as that Exerci&s;e is a great and nece&s;&s;ary Means to keep them in an healthful and vigorous State; and without it we &s;hall &s;oon contract a &s;trange Hebetude of Mind, as well as Inability of Body to all the Functions of Life. If the great and rich would but thoroughly realize this, it might happily tend to le&s;&s;en their love of Ea&s;e, and put them upon Activity and Diligence in the Employment of their Time and Powers to &s;ome or other of the valuable Purpo&s;es of Life.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Rich,</HI> as I &s;aid, are not the Per&s;ons the Apo&s;tle has here to do with, but the <HI>Poor</HI>; who&s;e Circum&s;tances in the World are &s;uch as that, <HI>if they won't work,</HI> they have nothing to depend on but the <HI>Charities</HI> of their Friends and Neighbours. And it is with re&s;pect to this kind of Per|&s;ons, in &s;pecial, that the Apo&s;tle has commanded, <HI>if any will not work, neither &s;hould he eat.</HI></P>
<P>And the <HI>Manner</HI> in which he has worded the Com|mand is ob&s;ervable, and clearly a&s;certains its true Mean|ing. <HI>If any WILL not work.</HI> Tho&s;e that <HI>will not work,</HI> not tho&s;e that <HI>cannot,</HI> are the Per&s;ons here pointed out. Such among the Poor as are <HI>willing</HI> to work, but can't get Employment, are not the Per&s;ons &s;ecluded from the Bread of Charity. Neither are they re&s;trained from eating of this Bread, who would be willing to work, but are incapable of Labour, by Rea&s;on of Sickne&s;s, or Lamene&s;s, or the De|cays of an infirm old Age.</P>
<P>As for di&s;abled Per&s;ons, it was never the De&s;ign of the Apo&s;tle to command, that, <HI>if any would not work, neither &s;hould they eat.</HI> No; tho' their Incapacity for Labour was brought upon them by their own Follies and Vices. It is very unhappy indeed when this is the Ca&s;e, as, God knows, it too often is. And &s;uch Per&s;ons have infinite Rea&s;on to
<PB N="8" REF="006827_0006_102A5A7AF16C09E0">
look back upon their pa&s;t mad and &s;inful Conduct with Grief and Shame: But yet, if they are really unable to do any Thing, in a way of Labour, towards their own Sup|port, they are by no means to be neglected. They are, in common, with other di&s;abled Per&s;ons, the proper Objects of Charity, the Poor of this World, concerning whom it is the Will of God, that they &s;hould be pitied and help'd. And the Rich &s;hould look upon them&s;elves obliged to &s;hew Compa&s;&s;ion towards them. If any &s;hould <HI>&s;ee a Brother or Si&s;ter,</HI> of this Character, <HI>naked, and de&s;titute of daily Food,</HI> they &s;hould not only <HI>&s;ay to them, depart in Peace, be ye warm|ed and filled, but give them tho&s;e Things which are needful to the Body</HI>; &s;uiting their Charities to their particular Wants and Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>But we are under no &s;uch Obligations with re&s;pect to the other Sort of poor People, tho&s;e who <HI>can</HI> work, but <HI>won't</HI>; who may have Work to do, and have Activity of Body to do it, but no Will to employ them&s;elves in Labour. Con|cerning the&s;e Poor, it is the Command of an in&s;pired Apo&s;tle, <HI>that they &s;hall not eat,</HI> i. e. &s;hall not be maintained at the Charge of others; &s;hall not live upon the Charities of their Chri&s;tian Friends and Brethren.</P>
<P>Some, perhaps, may think this a very unrea&s;onable Com|mand. Doubtle&s;s, it will be complained of as hard and &s;evere by the indolent and lazy among the Poor. But it is really one of the mo&s;t equitable Commands; a Com|mand founded on &s;o much Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice, yea, and Goodne&s;s too, that not a Word can fairly be objected again&s;t it. And this leads me, as was propo&s;ed,</P>
<P N="2">II. In the &s;econd Place, to &s;ay what may be thought &s;ufficient to <HI>ju&s;tify</HI> this Command of the Apo&s;tle, and point out its <HI>Rea&s;onablene&s;s, Equity and Goodne&s;s.</HI> And the follow|ing Things may be briefly offered to this Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">I. The e&s;tabli&s;hed Laws of Nature are &s;uch as render it impo&s;&s;ible, that Mankind &s;hould be &s;upported, if they are generally lazy. Our Bodies are &s;o made as con&s;tantly to require Food and Raiment: Nor can the&s;e Nece&s;&s;aries be &s;upplied but by Labour. The Conveniencies and Com|forts of Life are more numerous, and require &s;till greater
<PB N="9" REF="006827_0007_102A5A5372B30CB8">
Care and Pains. The Almighty, it is true, if he had &s;een fit, could have maintained the humane Race, without the Concurrence of any Endeavours of their own, by making Nature &s;o rich and fruitful, in every re&s;pect, as to have rendered Art u&s;ele&s;s, and Indu&s;try &s;uperfluous. But he has ordered Matters otherwi&s;e; and, no doubt, for wi&s;e and good Rea&s;ons. Our Food does not &s;pring out of the Earth without Culture; neither does our Raiment natural|ly grow on us, as it does on the inferiour Creatures. The <HI>Birds of the Air &s;ow not</HI>; neither do the <HI>Lillies of the Field toil or &s;pin:</HI> But we are obliged to do both. The e&s;ta|bli&s;hed Order of Nature is &s;uch, as that, if we don't, we mu&s;t unavoidably &s;uffer, if not peri&s;h, for want of Food to eat, and Raiment to put on.</P>
<P>Now if Labour is thus nece&s;&s;ary for the Support of Life, it is contrary to all Rea&s;on, that tho&s;e &s;hould eat the Bread of Charity who won't work, while yet they have Ability therefor. What Right have the lazy and in|dolent, who are both healthy and &s;trong, to live on the Fruits of other Men's Labour? Wherein lies the Fitne&s;s of this? If without Labour the World can't &s;ub&s;i&s;t, for any to &s;it idle, depending upon a Supply from other Man's Indu&s;try, is certainly incongruous to an high Degree. Why &s;hould &s;ome Men labour and toil to get Bread for tho&s;e who are as able to work as they are, but chu&s;e rather to &s;pend their Time in doing nothing? The Suppo&s;ition is ab&s;urd. It is not fair; it &s;avours neither of Rea&s;on nor Ju&s;tice, that the diligent and laborious &s;hould, by their Bounties, relieve the Wants of tho&s;e, who are poor and needy, not thro' Incapacity for Bodily Exertions, but be|cau&s;e they are &s;luggi&s;h and idle.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>po&s;itive Will of God</HI> has appointed <HI>Labour</HI> the <HI>Means</HI> in order to a Livelihood in the World. To this Purpo&s;e are tho&s;e Words of the Almighty, which, tho' originally directed to <HI>Adam,</HI> are yet obligatory upon all his Po&s;terity, <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.19. <HI>In the Sweat of thy Face thou &s;halt eat Bread, 'till thou return to the Ground.</HI> As this Ap|pointment of Heaven was publi&s;hed after the <HI>Fall</HI> of Man, and as a Puni&s;hment for Sin, it &s;hould &s;eem as tho' hu|mane Labour had but an ignoble Original. And &s;o it
<PB N="10" REF="006827_0008_102A3802C8D9EE20">
had, is con&s;idered as to <HI>Kind</HI> and <HI>Degree:</HI> But as to the <HI>Thing it &s;elf,</HI> it was as truly the Requirement of God from Man in his <HI>innocent,</HI> as in his lap&s;ed State. Even <HI>Adam</HI> in <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> was not &s;o wholly provided with every Thing by the &s;ole Bounty of Nature, but that it was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould be employed in Labour. We therefore read, not only that he had Work to do in his innocent State, but what it was, namely, <HI>to dre&s;s and keep the Garden of Eden,</HI> Gen. 2.15. If therefore Sin had not entered into the World, Men would not have lived without Labour; tho' it would have been of a <HI>nobler</HI> Kind, and in a <HI>le&s;s Degree.</HI> In the&s;e re&s;pects, Sin has made a difference. We mu&s;t now &s;weat and toil. Nature calls for this Sort of Labour, and will not furni&s;h us, upon any lower Terms, with &s;uch of her good Things as we &s;tand in need of: And it is the <HI>expre&s;s Will of God,</HI> that, in this Way, we &s;hould earn our Bread. Laborious Diligence is the <HI>Means</HI> by which he has <HI>ordained</HI> we &s;hould &s;upply our&s;elves with Food, and other Nece&s;&s;aries of Life.</P>
<P>If any therefore indulge to Idlene&s;s, who have Ability for Labour, they virtually &s;et a&s;ide <HI>the Method</HI> God has been plea&s;ed to direct to, and enjoin, in order to their be|ing &s;upported in Life. And is it rea&s;onable they &s;hould be maintained in any other? Is it fit, if Men won't work, when they can, that a different Way, from what the Wi&s;|dom of God has in&s;tituted, &s;hould be taken for their Supply with Bread? And yet, by &s;upporting the needy in Idlene&s;s, we con&s;tructively oppo&s;e the <HI>Appointment</HI> of God, and &s;ub|&s;titute a Method for their Maintenance of our own devi|&s;ing. And is this rea&s;onable? Can it be ju&s;tified? Ought Per&s;ons to be maintained in plain Contempt of the Con|&s;titution of God?</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible, it has &s;ometimes been pleaded, that, how|ever it might be in former Days, the Cares of Religion now, in a great Mea&s;ure, &s;uper&s;ede the Affairs of the World; in&s;omuch that if Men neglect their temporal Bu&s;ine&s;s, pro|vided they do it that they may have Time to attend on the Spiritual Concerns of their Souls and another World, they ought to be con&s;idered and helped; and that it is a <HI>Chri&s;tian Duty</HI> to &s;upport &s;uch pious Per&s;ons upon the Bread of Charity.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="006827_0009_102A5A55D3D3A730">A &s;pecious Pretence this for Idlene&s;s, in contempt of the Government of God; but a very poor one; as be|ing founded on intirely wrong Notions of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion, which requires its Profe&s;&s;ors, not only to mind the Things of another World, but the Affairs of this al&s;o. And it is particularly ob&s;ervable, Chri&s;tianity is &s;o far from allowing Men to be &s;lothful in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of their pro|per Callings, that it has reinforced the <HI>Law of Labour</HI> given to <HI>Adam,</HI> and in him to all Mankind, by adopting it into its Scheme of Morals. Says <HI>Paul,</HI> the Apo&s;tle of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians,</HI> and in them to all Chri&s;tians, <HI>We command and exhort, by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that with Quietne&s;s they work, and eat their own Bread</HI>; as we read in the 12th <HI>v.</HI> of my Context. Very ob&s;erva|ble is the Manner, in which the&s;e Words are delivered, <HI>We command, and exhort, by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> He does not &s;atisfy him&s;elf with <HI>exhorting</HI> only; but he <HI>com|mands.</HI> And he does it <HI>by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> i. e. by his Authority, as commi&s;&s;ioned, and empowered by him. So that who&s;oever, in this Article, <HI>de&s;pi&s;eth, de&s;pi&s;eth not Man, but God</HI>; for here the Contempt does finally termi|nate, as our Saviour him&s;elf has taught us, in <HI>Luke</HI> 10.16. <HI>He that de&s;pi&s;eth you, de&s;pi&s;eth me; and he that de&s;pi&s;eth me, de&s;pi&s;eth him that &s;ent me.</HI></P>
<P>Indu&s;trious Labour is therefore the Law of <HI>Chri&s;tianity.</HI> In&s;tead of altering this Method appointed by God, from the Beginning, for the Support of Life, the Go&s;pel has confirmed it. So that Idlene&s;s is a Reflection upon the go|verning Wi&s;dom and Authority of God under the <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> as well as former Di&s;pen&s;ations. And to &s;upport Man in Sloth, tho' they &s;hould di&s;gui&s;e their Guilt under the Co|ver of the mo&s;t pious Pretences, is a virtual &s;etting up our own Wi&s;dom in oppo&s;ition to the Wi&s;dom of God, and &s;ubverting the Method he has e&s;tabli&s;hed, both in <HI>the nature of Things,</HI> and by <HI>po&s;itive Revelation,</HI> for the &s;upply of Man|kind with the Nece&s;&s;aries and Conveniences of Life.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Command, in my Text, is founded on the <HI>publick Good.</HI> For there cannot be a flouri&s;hing People, without Labour. It is by Improvement in Arts and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> that they mu&s;t grow in Wealth, and Power, and become
<PB N="12" REF="006827_0010_102A5A7F7B846F58">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the various Emoluments tending to the Bene|fit and Plea&s;ure of Life; and the&s;e Arts take their Ri&s;e from, and are carried on by, the Indu&s;try of particular Per&s;ons. And this is &s;o evident, that while &s;ome Nations have increa&s;ed in Riches, and Grandeur, and Power, by being indu&s;trious, tho' great Ob&s;tacles, and di&s;couraging Difficulties have &s;tood in the Way; others, thro' Sloth and Indolence, have been kept low, and &s;unk in Oblivion, tho' under great <HI>natural Advantages</HI> to have got into flou|ri&s;hing Circum&s;tances: Or, it may be, they have become a Prey to other more active and enterpri&s;ing Nations, who knew how to make a better U&s;e of their Advantages. And the Truth is, the <HI>natural Advantages</HI> a People are fa|voured with, whether for Hu&s;bandry, Navigation, Fi&s;hery, Manufactures, or any other Source of Wealth, will be, in a great Mea&s;ure, lo&s;t, and, as it were, thrown away upon them, without Labour and Indu&s;try, in making a wi&s;e and good U&s;e of them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Athenians</HI> were &s;o &s;en&s;ible of this, that <HI>Idlene&s;s,</HI> in that State, &s;ubjected the guilty Per&s;on, whoever he was, to a Pro&s;ecution at Law, as an Injury to the Common-Wealth: And they made Inquiry of each Man and Wo|man, <HI>qu&acirc; Arte &s;e Alerent?</HI> By what Trade they &s;upported them&s;elves? And &s;o long ago as the Days of <HI>Pharoah,</HI> it was taken for granted that a Man could not be without <HI>&s;ome Occupation,</HI> or other. Hence that Que&s;tion of his to <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s Brethren, upon their coming into <HI>Egypt,</HI> Gen. 47.3. <HI>What is your Occupation?</HI></P>
<P>The Law, in my Text, is therefore connected with the <HI>publick Good</HI>; as it tends to encourage Indu&s;try, by re&s;training us from Di&s;tributions to the lazy and &s;lothful. And it is indeed a great Hurt to a <HI>Community,</HI> when pri|vate Per&s;ons di&s;pen&s;e their Charities to &s;uch, among the poor, as keep them&s;elves &s;o by an Indulgence to Idlene&s;s, while yet they are able to work. For the <HI>Public</HI> lo&s;es the whole Benefit of the Labour of tho&s;e, who are thus &s;up|ported in Idlene&s;s; and not only &s;o, but is liable to &s;uffer all the Inconveniencies which are to be looked for, in Con|&s;equence of their indulging to Sloth, and doing nothing.</P>
<P>And it is ob&s;ervable, the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> had it particularly in
<PB N="13" REF="006827_0011_102A5A575C510218">
his View to guard again&s;t the&s;e <HI>public Inconveniencies,</HI> when he gave the Command in my Text. Hence he adds, in the Words that immediately follow, giving the Rea&s;on, at lea&s;t one Rea&s;on of the Command, <HI>For we have heard, that there are &s;ome among you which walk di&s;orderly, working not at all; but are Bu&s;y-bodies.</HI></P>
<P>You ob&s;erve, the&s;e Per&s;ons who did not work, and were the Occa&s;ion of the Command in the Text, were <HI>di&s;|orderly.</HI> And this, in a Sen&s;e, is always the Ca&s;e. When|ever Per&s;ons are <HI>idle,</HI> they are <HI>di&s;orderly:</HI> For an idle Life is, in the whole of it, a <HI>Di&s;order.</HI> It &s;ubverts the Order God has e&s;tabli&s;h'd for the Support of Mankind, and would introduce another Method of Livelihood than <HI>that,</HI> infinite Wi&s;dom has contrived and appointed.</P>
<P>Nor is this the only Sen&s;e in which idle Per&s;ons are <HI>di&s;orderly.</HI> They are too often <HI>Tempters to others to neglect their Bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI> Having none of their own, and being in|clined to none, they endeavour to find, or, if they can't do that, to make Per&s;ons as idle as them&s;elves, to the great Detriment of the Public, and, many Times, the intire Ruin of their Companions in Sloth. And who are &s;o much noted for the moral Di&s;orders of <HI>Lying</HI> and <HI>Stealing,</HI> as tho&s;e who have &s;ettled into an Habit of Lazine&s;s? Their Lazine&s;s reduces them to Straits and Difficulties; and the&s;e, as the readie&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t Way to &s;upply their Wants, put them upon deceiving the kind and charitable by artfully invented Fal&s;hoods, or el&s;e upon &s;ecretly robbing them of their Money, or their Goods. And who more given to <HI>Tipling</HI> than the Per&s;ons who have accu&s;tomed them&s;elves to Idlene&s;s? The Drones in a Place are commonly the People who doze away their Time and Sen&s;es over their Cups. There are indeed no <HI>Di&s;orders,</HI> but the idle are liable to them; and their Danger lies in their Idlene&s;s. Were they diligently employed in Bu&s;ine&s;s of one Kind or another, their Thoughts and Time would be properly taken up; but having &s;ettled into a Temper inclining them to &s;it idle and do nothing, they lie open to every Temptation, and are in danger of being betrayed into moral Di&s;orders of every Kind.</P>
<P>And the&s;e idle Per&s;ons were not only di&s;orderly, but
<PB N="14" REF="006827_0012_102A5A595A6F70D8">
<HI>Bu&s;y-bodies. We hear there are &s;ome who work not at all, but are Bu&s;y-bodies.</HI> This may &s;eem an Incon&s;i&s;tency; but it is mo&s;t commonly the Truth of the Ca&s;e. None more ready to <HI>bu&s;y</HI> them&s;elves in other Men's Matters, than tho&s;e who neglect all Bu&s;ine&s;s of their own. Not mind|ing their own Affairs, they have Lei&s;ure, and generally Inclination, to intrude into other Men's. Hence that Cha|racter of &s;ome, in the Apo&s;tolic Times, <HI>They learn to be idle; wandring about from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e; and not only idle, but Tat|lers al&s;o, and Bu&s;y-bodies, &s;peaking Things which they ought not.</HI> 1 Tim. 5.13. And none indeed are, u&s;ually, more free with their Tongues than <HI>idle Per&s;ons</HI>; none wander more about from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e; none are more ready to meddle in Things which don't belong to them; acting in the Sphere of others, tho' they won't in their own. And I need not &s;ay that this intermeddling in other Men's Con|cerns, greatly tends to <HI>public</HI> Hurt;&mdash;for it kindles Con|tention, creates Feuds and Animo&s;ities; and is indeed a main Scource of that Variance and Strife, which di&s;turb the Peace of Society.</P>
<P>And is it any Wonder, when <HI>Idlene&s;s</HI> is connected with &s;uch Damage to the <HI>Public,</HI> which might be as much be|nefitted by <HI>Indu&s;try,</HI> that we &s;hould be re&s;trained from &s;up|porting tho&s;e who won't work, thro' Slothfulne&s;s of Di&s;po|&s;ition? It is certainly a mo&s;t rea&s;onable Re&s;traint: And the Command that lays it, is &s;o far from being hard and unju&s;t, that it kindly and equitably con&s;ults the <HI>public Good.</HI> And it is an Honour to the Chri&s;tian Religion, that it can boa&s;t of this, and a great many other Commands, which, the more critically they are examined, the more wi&s;e and equitable they appear to be.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Command we are con&s;idering is admirably a|dapted to promote <HI>private</HI> as well as public Good. For indu&s;trious Labour is the Way for <HI>Individuals,</HI> as well as <HI>Communities,</HI> to thrive and flouri&s;h. Men, it is true, may come to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Wealth by Inheritance. But Wealth, even in this Ca&s;e, was originally the Purcha&s;e of Labour; and it is only in this Way, that it can be im|proved to Advantage. Idlene&s;s naturally tends to <HI>Wa&s;te,</HI> and will, in Time, reduce the greate&s;t E&s;tate to no|thing.

But however it be as to Men of Sub&s;tance, tho&s;e, who have their Fortunes to make, mu&s;t certainly take Pains. They may as well expect to be learned without Study, as to be rich without Diligence. If a Man's Cir|cum&s;tances are low, he can ri&s;e and pro&s;per in no other Way, but that of Indu&s;try. To this Purpo&s;e are tho&s;e Proverbs of <HI>Solomon,</HI> Ch. 10. v. 4. <HI>He becometh poor that dealeth with a &s;lack Hand: But the Hand of the diligent maketh rich.</HI> And in the 12th Ch. v. 24. <HI>The Hand of the diligent &s;hall bear Rule: But the &s;lothful &s;hall be under Tri|bute.</HI> And &s;o nece&s;&s;ary an expedient is Diligence in or|der to Wealth, that if Men are idle, they will unavoidably be poor. Hence that Ob&s;ervation of the wi&s;e Man, <HI>Prov.</HI> 23.21. <HI>Drow&s;ine&s;s &s;hall clothe a Man with Rags.</HI> And again, Ch. 24.30.31.34. <HI>I went by the Field of the &s;lothful, and by the Vineyard of the Man void of Under&s;tanding: And lo, it was all grown over with Thorns, and Nottles had cover|ed the Face thereof, and the Stone-wall thereof was broken down. &mdash;So &s;hall thy Poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy Want as an armed Man.</HI> And it is ob&s;ervable, one of the Argu|ments the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> u&s;es, to enforce the Duty of La|bour, upon the &s;lothful among the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians,</HI> is its Ten|dency to &s;upply their Wants, &s;o as that they &s;hould have no lack of outward good Things. 1. <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> 4.10, 12. <HI>We be&s;eech you, Brethren, to do your own Bu&s;ine&s;s, and to work with your own Hands&mdash; that ye may have lack of nothing.</HI> Indu&s;trious Labour is, you &s;ee, in the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI>'s Opinion, an effectual Expedient to prevent Want. If Per&s;ons are idle, they may expect to be needy: Whereas, if they <HI>do their own Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> and <HI>work with their own Hands,</HI> they will have lack of nothing; nothing for their Supply either with Nece&s;&s;aries or Conveniencies.</P>
<P>It is therefore for every Man's <HI>private Intere&s;t,</HI> that the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> has commanded, <HI>if any will not work, neither &s;hall he eat.</HI> And indeed charitable Donations, &s;upplying the needy without Labour, in&s;tead of being a Kindne&s;s, is a real and great Di&s;&s;ervice to them; as it tends to &s;ettle them in Idlene&s;s. For if idle People find, that they can be &s;upported by the Charities of others, in&s;tead of employ|ing them&s;elves in Labour, they will indulge to Sloth, 'till

it becomes their habitual permanent Temper; than which there is not a more certain Pre&s;age of their Ruin&punc; For Idlene&s;s naturally and powerfully tends to keep Men in Poverty, or to reduce them to it. If they are low in the World, it will unavoidably keep them &s;o: and if they po&s;|&s;e&s;s E&s;tates, it will &s;oon wa&s;te them away, or &s;ink them into nothing. Nor is this the only bad Effect of Idlene&s;s. It has a &s;trange Influence to enfeeble the Powers both of Mind and Body, and render Men u&s;ele&s;s to them&s;elves as well as others. Be&s;ides all which, it is the great Inlet to all manner of Wickedne&s;s, and tends to corrupt Men's Mo|rals, and make them Scourges to them&s;elves, as well as Plagues to Society. It is therefore a real and great Hurt, not only to the <HI>Publick,</HI> but to <HI>private Per&s;ons,</HI> individually con&s;idered, to &s;upport them in Sloth; and the Command, in my Text, re&s;training us herefrom, is therefore an In|&s;tance, not of Severity, but of Love and Kindne&s;s to them.</P>
<P>I have now &s;aid what may be thought &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI>'s Command, by &s;hewing that it is &s;o far from being arbitrary and unrea&s;onable, that it is connected, in the Nature of Things, with the Good of Mankind, con|&s;idered both <HI>individually,</HI> and as coale&s;cing in <HI>Society,</HI> and carries in it all the Marks of Fairne&s;s, Equity, and Good|ne&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">III. It remains now, in the la&s;t Place, that I make &s;ome &s;uitable <HI>Application</HI> of what has been di&s;cour&s;ed.</P>
<P>And, was it upon another Occa&s;ion, I &s;hould be&s;peak the poor, tho&s;e among them e&s;pecially who are idle, in the Language of the Apo&s;tle, in the Ver&s;e but one following my Text, <HI>exhorting and commanding them by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that with quietne&s;s they work, and eat their own Bread:</HI>&mdash;But con&s;idering the De&s;ign of our being together at this Time, with the Character of the Per&s;ons here con|vened, it may be more proper to confine my Di&s;cour&s;e to the <HI>rich</HI>; who are as truly concerned in the great <HI>Go&s;pel Command</HI> we have been illu&s;trating, as the poor.</P>
<P>You are hereby, my Brethren, re&s;trained as to the Di&s;tri|bution of your Charity; not being allowed to di&s;pen&s;e it
<PB N="17" REF="006827_0015_102A5A8105112E20">
promi&s;cuou&s;ly, but obliged to take due Care to find out &s;uitable Objects; di&s;tingui&s;hing properly between tho&s;e nee|dy People who are <HI>able,</HI> and tho&s;e who are <HI>unable,</HI> to employ them&s;elves in Labour.</P>
<P>You can &s;carce be too liberal in your Charities to tho&s;e, who, in the Providence of God, are reduced to Straits, not thro' Slothfulne&s;s, but real Incapacity for Work. The Chri&s;tian Law, requiring Charity, was made with a &s;pe|cial View to this Kind of needy People: and you may, under no Pretence, &s;hut up the Bowels of your Compa&s;&s;i|on again&s;t the Cry of their Wants. Charity is the Way, the infinitely benevolent God has ordained for the &s;upply of their Nece&s;&s;ities. And you &s;hould be ready, in this Way, to mini&s;ter to their Relief, according to your Abili|ty, and as you have Opportunity. But it is &s;uperfluous to urge you upon this Head; for, as touching charitable Mini&s;trations to the <HI>truly nece&s;&s;itous,</HI> we may even boa&s;t of this Town. The good Lord reward into their Bo&s;om, an hundred fold, all the Kindne&s;&s;es they have &s;hewn to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, e&s;pecially in the late Day of general Calamity.</P>
<P>But tho' you can't be too generous in your Charities to the poor, yet, as I &s;aid, you mu&s;t take Care to di&s;tingui&s;h between them. For as to them who <HI>can,</HI> but <HI>won't,</HI> work; who have Ability for Labour, but no Di&s;po&s;ition, you are re&s;trained from &s;upporting them in <HI>Idlene&s;s.</HI> The Com|mand in my Text is plainly a <HI>Statute of Heaven,</HI> tying up your Hands from Charitable Di&s;tributions to the &s;lothful poor. And, &s;o far as appears to me, it would be an evi|dent Breach of the Law of the Go&s;pel, as well as of Na|ture, to be&s;tow upon tho&s;e the <HI>Bread of Charity,</HI> who might earn and eat their <HI>own Bread,</HI> if they did not &s;hamefully idle away their Time.</P>
<P>This, if I mi&s;take not, is both a &s;ea&s;onable and impor|tant Truth; and if it were duly attended to, there would not be &s;o much mi&s;placed Charity, as that certainly is, which is given to <HI>meer Drones.</HI> Many &s;uch there have been among us; and perhaps it may be too much owing to the un|di&s;tingui&s;h'd Kindne&s;s and Compa&s;&s;ion of the Benevolent, that they have &s;o increa&s;ed upon us, to the great Detriment of the <HI>Public</HI>; which is intirely deprived of the Labour of
<PB N="18" REF="006827_0016_102A5A6040190258">
great Numbers, who, in&s;tead of living upon the Charity of others, might eat <HI>their own Bread.</HI> It is to be hoped, there will be a better Care taken upon this Head for the Time to come; and the rather, as there is now a Way wherein the charitably inclined may be a&s;&s;i&s;ting even to the <HI>&s;lothful</HI> among the poor. They may be thus helpful to them by their Donations to &s;trengthen the <HI>Society,</HI> not long &s;ince formed, <HI>for encouraging Indu&s;try, and employing the Poor.</HI></P>
<P>My Text evidently countenances the formation of &s;uch a Society; the De&s;ign whereof is one and the &s;ame with that of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> who delivered the Command con|tained in it, <HI>viz.</HI> the putting poor People, who are able, upon maintaining them&s;elves by their own Labour and Indu&s;try, conformable to the Con&s;titution of Nature, and the Ap|pointment of God from the beginning of the World.</P>
<P>And in what more proper Way can we &s;hew Kindne&s;s to the poor of this Sort, than by contributing to &s;uch a generous De&s;ign of &s;etting them to Work, that with quiet|ne&s;s they may Labour, and, as the Fruit thereof, eat their own Bread. We &s;hall herein concur with the infinitely good God him&s;elf, who does not give Men Food and Raiment, and other Nece&s;&s;aries immediately from Heaven, but by adding his Ble&s;&s;ing to their laborious Indu&s;try.</P>
<P>As this <HI>Society</HI> has not &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for any long Time, it cannot rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed, they &s;hould have accom|pli&s;hed any great Things: And yet, more a great deal has been effected, than Strangers to the Execution of their Scheme may be ready to imagine. According to the Information I have received, &s;ome thou&s;ands of Yards of good <HI>Linen Cloth</HI> have been already fitted for Market; a Specimen whereof, you have there before your Eyes. And it is ea&s;y to determine, that, in order to this, Employ mu&s;t have been given to a very con&s;iderable Number of La|bourers, in rai&s;ing Flax, in preparing it for the Wheel, in &s;pinning it into Thread, and then in weaving it into Cloth. Some hundreds of Women and Children have, by this Means, been kept at Work, whereby they have done a great deal towards &s;upplying them&s;elves with Bread, to the ea&s;ing the Town of its Burthen in providing for the poor. And, as one good Effect of the &s;etting up this
<PB N="19" REF="006827_0017_102A5A83EA916278">
<HI>Linen Manufacture,</HI> it may with Truth be &s;aid, there is now to be found, in the Town, many a virtuous married Woman, and young Maiden (&s;ome In&s;tances whereof are there pre&s;ented to your View) who may be characterized in the Words of <HI>Solomon, She &s;eeketh Flax, and worketh wil|lingly with her Hands. She layeth her Hands to the Spindle, and her Hands hold the Di&s;taff. She maketh fine Linen, and &s;elleth it to the Merchant.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps, &s;carce any De&s;ign of this Nature has afforded a more hopeful Pro&s;pect in its Beginning, notwith&s;tanding its Interruption, for a con&s;iderable Time, by the late ge|neral Prevalence of the <HI>Small-Pox</HI>; and, if duly encoura|ged, and vigorou&s;ly pro&s;ecuted, there is good Rea&s;on to think, it will &s;oon become exten&s;ive in its U&s;efulne&s;s; finding Employ for great Numbers, e&s;pecially among the Female Poor, both Women and Children, and by this Means enabling them to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the &s;upport of the Fa|milies to which they belong, to the great Advantage of the Community. It is indeed a Scheme, &s;o far as I am able to judge, well calculated to promote Indu&s;try, and, its Com|panion, Frugality; than which nothing will more power|fully tend to deliver us from that Poverty to which we are reduced by our Idlene&s;s and Extravagance. And every one concerned for the Good of his Country mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, it is high Time to lend an helping Hand towards the bringing into Effect every wi&s;e Projection to rai&s;e us out of the low Condition we are in, and make us a flou|ri&s;hing People.</P>
<P>It will, perhaps, be urged by &s;ome, that the &s;etting up the <HI>Linen Manufacture</HI> is <HI>too great</HI> an Undertaking for &s;o poor and &s;mall a People, and an <HI>unwi&s;e</HI> one, at this Time, when the Price of Labour runs &s;o high. But as poor and &s;mall as we are, we need Linen of mo&s;t Sorts, and can't do without it. And if, notwith&s;tanding the high Price of Labour, we can make it our&s;elves &s;o as that it &s;hall turn out cheaper than if we imported it from abroad, as it is now known by Experience that we can, it is cer|tainly a Point of Wi&s;dom to do &s;o: And the rather, as tho&s;e may be employed, to good Purpo&s;e, in this Branch of Bu&s;ine&s;s (Children in particular) who have hitherto
<PB N="20" REF="006827_0018_102A5A87013BAC80">
been &s;uffered in a great Mea&s;ure, to &s;pend their Time too much in Idlene&s;s. And it ought farther to be con&s;idered, there is no <HI>Manufacture</HI> our Soil and Climate are better &s;itted to encourage the &s;etting up, and endeavouring to cul|tivate and bring to Perfection, than the <HI>Linen.</HI> And, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> this is not the <HI>Staple Manufacture</HI> of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> we have Rea&s;on to hope they will &s;trengthen us in it. To be &s;ure, it looks as tho' it would be for their Intere&s;t to do &s;o, as, in Time, if it &s;hould extend it &s;elf thro' this Province, and the neighbouring Colonies, and be brought to any con&s;iderable Degree of Perfection, it might, in a good Mea&s;ure, &s;upply them with what they are now obliged to pay their Money for to other Nations.</P>
<P>Others, it may be, may fear, if this <HI>Manufacture</HI> &s;hould be encouraged, and &s;ucceed, that it might hurt them in their Trade abroad, by le&s;&s;ening the Demand for, or lowering the Price of, the <HI>Linen</HI> they import for Sale. But &s;uch are evidently too much under the government of a &s;elfi&s;h Spirit to be regarded in this Matter. And in|deed, if their Fears are ju&s;tly grounded, there cannot be a &s;tronger Argument, &s;o far as we con&s;ult the public Weal, to &s;et forward the pre&s;ent Scheme with the utmo&s;t Vigour; as the profe&s;&s;ed Intention of it is, the <HI>Good of the Community,</HI> and not the <HI>private Intere&s;t</HI> of any indivi|dual Per&s;on what&s;oever.</P>
<P>There may be &s;till others, who may think much of the Expence that mu&s;t attend the effectual carrying this De|&s;ign into Execution, and imagine it better it &s;hould drop than be &s;upported at any con&s;iderable Charge. But what Projection of this Nature was ever formed, but upon the Suppo&s;ition of Charge in executing it to Purpo&s;e, in the Beginning? The only proper Que&s;tion is, Whether this is a likely Scheme, under proper Cultivation, to counter-ballance, with Advantage, the Expence nece&s;&s;ary in order to its taking Effect? And there does not &s;eem to be much Room for Debate upon the Point, thus &s;tated. The <HI>Linen Manufacture</HI> has proved a noble Scource of Wealth to other People. And why may not we reap the like Benefit from it? Our natural Advantages to carry it on are well adapted to the Purpo&s;e. We are in the&s;e Re&s;pects, ex|ceeded
<PB N="21" REF="006827_0019_102A5A61C62A75F0">
by no People on the Earth. And if it be not our own Fault, we may &s;oon find our Account in the Pro|&s;ecution of this Branch of Bu&s;ine&s;s. It will certainly, if not neglected, or di&s;couraged, &s;ave a great deal of that, which is now exported, either in Money, or other Things, to purcha&s;e the Linen that is nece&s;&s;arily con&s;umed in the Country; be&s;ides which, it will employ a great many needy idle People, who in&s;tead of being &s;upported by <HI>private Cha|rities,</HI> or <HI>public Taxes</HI> levied for that Purpo&s;e, may be fed and clothed with the Fruit of their own Labour; by Means whereof, in&s;tead of continuing burthen&s;ome, they will be|come u&s;eful and valuable, Members of the Community. And the&s;e Advantages alone, if there were no other, are &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify the pre&s;ent Undertaking, as a very wi&s;e and good one.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it is not ea&s;y to conceive, but that every Lover of his Country &s;hould wi&s;h <HI>God-Speed</HI> to this di&s;in|tere&s;ted Scheme for its Welfare: Nor is it doubted, but that many will a&s;&s;i&s;t, by their Donations, towards its be|ing vigorou&s;ly carried more and more into Effect. It is indeed a difficult Day. We are in a low impoveri&s;h'd Condition. But this is a Con&s;ideration powerfully &s;uited, not to &s;hut, but to open wide, both the Hearts and Hands of tho&s;e who have Ability to help forward the pre&s;ent De|&s;ign; as it was at fir&s;t projected, and then entered upon, directly with a View to relieve us under our Poverty, by opening a new Scource of Indu&s;try, well adapted to better our Circum&s;tances, and that can't well fail of doing &s;o, if properly encouraged, and wi&s;ely improved.</P>
<P>It is to be hoped therefore, the Gentlemen, to whom it is principally owing, that we have a <HI>Linen Manufacture</HI> now &s;et up, and &s;o far under Improvement, as to exhibit &s;en&s;ible Proof of its being a <HI>capable Fund</HI> of rich Advan|tage to the Public, will continue their Sup&s;cription, till it has got more Strength, and is better able to &s;upport it &s;elf. The &s;ame Benevolence of Spirit, which at fir&s;t prompted you to encourage &s;o u&s;eful a De&s;ign, will power|fully urge you to go on doing &s;o, that it may, at length, get &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;h'd, as to be in no Danger of coming to nothing. <HI>Be not weary of well doing; for ye &s;hall reap if ye faint not.</HI></P>

And this I can heartily, and would earne&s;tly, re|commend to every one profe&s;&s;ing a Love to his Country, in proportion to his Circum&s;tances.

<P><PB N="24" REF="006827_0022_102A5A8A0B2E6958">THE many Advantages ari&s;ing from a well regu|lated Society of this Sort, as they are exceeding apparent, &s;o it is pre&s;um'd the De&s;ign will meet with a chearful Reception, and exten&s;ive Encouragement. &mdash; In the pre&s;ent State of this Province, we are not perhaps in a Condition greatly to enlarge our Ex|ports, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary therefore, that by all pru|dent Methods we contrive as much as po&s;&s;ible to le&s;&s;en our Import. This will be con&s;iderably effect|ed, by promoting a <HI>Linen Manufacture</HI>; for which it is computed that &pound; 50,000 Sterling are annually &s;ent to <HI>Europe,</HI> when at the &s;ame Time it may be carried on to &s;uch Advantage, as that Linen of all Sorts may be made cheaper among our&s;elves, as is now found by Experience.&mdash;Be&s;ides, the Hu&s;band|man will from hence receive Encouragement for rai&s;ing of Flax, to which the Lands in this Pro|vince are known to be well adapted, and &s;o a new Source of Riches laid open to that u&s;eful and nece&s;|&s;ary Body of Men, extracted in the mo&s;t natural and unenvied Way, as being the Product of our own Soil: Hereby al&s;o &s;undry Trade&s;men and Handi|crafts will receive further Employment; &s;uch as the Makers of Looms, Spinning Wheels, Heckles, Reels, and the like; but the mo&s;t immediate Advantage is that, which will ari&s;e from the Employment of the Poor, at pre&s;ent a great Burthen to this Community, by the heavy Taxes levy'd for their Support. Ma|ny Thou&s;ands of the&s;e may be employ'd in this &s;ingle Manufacture, and taught not only to &s;upport them&s;elves, but to become u&s;eful and valuable Mem|bers of the Community. By this Means the Price of Labour, &s;o much and ju&s;tly complained of, will gradually be le&s;&s;en'd, as more Hands will be in|du&s;triou&s;ly

employ'd; the Poor will be decently cloath'd, and fed with the Fruits of their own Dili|gence; the publick Taxes abated, and in general a Spirit of Frugality, Indu&s;try and Virtue will proba|bly take place among us.</P>
<P>This Town has remarkably &s;ignalized its &s;elf, for its Charity and Compa&s;&s;ion to the Poor; who for &s;ome Years pa&s;t have been an encrea&s;ing Burthen, and yet the Supplies that are annually furni&s;h'd, are very far from being an adequate Relief to their Ne|ce&s;&s;ities; and what is wor&s;e, there is no Pro&s;pect of dimini&s;hing this Burthen in the pre&s;ent Way of di&s;|tributing our Charity; on the contrary, it mu&s;t be expected to increa&s;e by the continual Addition of new Objects, from which nothing but their Death will be likely to relea&s;e us, while a new Succe&s;&s;ion of them will daily pre&s;ent them&s;elves in the Room of tho&s;e, who are at re&s;t from their Mi&s;eries: Every Man of Sen&s;e mu&s;t &s;ee, and every Lover of his Country will deplore the Calamities that mu&s;t ari&s;e from increa&s;ing Poverty, Idlene&s;s and Vice; but every Chri&s;tian will feel the Mi&s;eries of &s;uch a State, almo&s;t as if they were his own, and be unea&s;y till &s;ome Method be entered upon, for providing an effectual Remedy again&s;t them.&mdash;Temporary Me|thods of Relief are very commendable, till &s;ome|thing better can be e&s;tabli&s;hed; but the&s;e are of the Nature of Palliatives only; it mu&s;t be a la&s;ting and permanent Scheme, that may be expected to reach the Root of this Malady: The Linen Manu|facture, when thoroughly under&s;tood, will appear to be &s;uch a Scheme, and under proper Cultivation will, it is apprehended, enlarge it &s;elf into a noble De|&s;ign, &s;o as not only to yield pre&s;ent Relief to great

Numbers of poor People, but by gradually extend|ing it &s;elf to all Parts of the Province, &s;eems to pro|mi&s;e a perpetual E&s;tabli&s;hment; and if it be enter'd upon with a proper Spirit, and vigorou&s;ly &s;upported in the Beginning, it will &s;oon add a new Branch of Riches to the Province, will cloath the naked, find Bread for the hungry, and Employment for the idle.</P>
<P>IN hopes of accompli&s;hing the good Ends above-mentioned, and depending upon the Ble&s;&s;ing of Almighty GOD, to give Succe&s;s to the Under|taking, we the Sub&s;cribers do promi&s;e to pay unto  <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="2 words">  hereby appointed Trea&s;urer to us the Sub&s;cribers, within one Month from the Date of the&s;e Pre|&s;ents, the Sums annexed to our re&s;pective Names, for promoting and carrying on a Linen Manufac|ture, and &s;uch other Manufactures, as the Society &s;hall hereafter think proper to encourage. We likewi&s;e promi&s;e to pay quarterly the Sums &s;ub|&s;cribed by us, as they &s;hall become due, until we &s;hall give Notice to the Society of our De&s;ire to be excu&s;ed.</P>
