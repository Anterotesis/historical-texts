</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT was a &s;ad Complaint of Old, up|braiding a People, who had made an high <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> of the true <HI>Religion;</HI> Ezek. V. 7. <HI>You have not done according to the Judgments of the Nations which be round about you.</HI> It &s;eems, other Nations, who had not been &s;o well-in&s;tructed as this People, yet had <HI>more Equity</HI> in their Dealings, and were People of <HI>Better Morals,</HI> than the&s;e who had been under the Covenant of God.</P>
<P>It has been complained, That tho' the <HI>Re|ligion</HI> of God, be Profe&s;&s;ed with an uncom|mon Show among our &s;elves, yet among us,
<PB N="2" REF="001823_0003_0FB83DE4EAB79BA0">there are too often found &s;uch <HI>Iniquities</HI> in the Dealings of Men, as are condemned even in the <HI>Judgments of the Nations;</HI> and there are <HI>Better Morals</HI> to be found in Places, which yet may have the Cen&s;ure of the Patriarch upon <HI>Gerar</HI> too much belonging to them, than &s;ome|times occur in what makes the mo&s;t flouri&s;h|ing Pretences to be a <HI>Land of Rectitude.</HI></P>
<P>But, I hope, it will never be complained, That the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, are by any Sinful Silence acce&s;&s;ary to the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, which <HI>Deny</HI> the <HI>Doctrine of God our Saviour,</HI> a|mong a People, that are under peculiar Ob|ligations to <HI>Adorn</HI> it. It &s;hall not be com|plained, That the Mini&s;ters do &s;o confine them&s;elves to Preach <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance,</HI> that the People forget <HI>Moral Hone&s;ty,</HI> thro' any Default of ours. It &s;hall be a&s;&s;erted, That with a due <HI>Frequency,</HI> as well as <HI>Fervency,</HI> we inculcate upon our Neighbours, the Duties of <HI>Moral Hone&s;ty,</HI> and remon&s;trate unto them, that without <HI>This,</HI> all their <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance</HI> is but a <HI>Counterfeit; God will reject it, and they &s;hall not pro&s;per in it!</HI></P>
<P>One <HI>Point of Morality,</HI> wherein we are told, that many People are defective, is, The Cau|tion with which Peoples <HI>Running into Debt,</HI> and <HI>Lying</HI> in it when they have run into it, ought for ever to be regulated. People there
<PB N="3" REF="001823_0004_0FB83DE85CC8B2B8">are, too many, who do bring <HI>Debts</HI> upon them&s;elves, in &s;uch a manner, and in &s;uch a mea&s;ure, that a <HI>Folly</HI> nothing &s;hort of <HI>Criminal,</HI> is to be charged upon them. And when they have brought &s;uch <HI>Debts</HI> upon them&s;elves, their <HI>Delay</HI> to get from under them, is what al&s;o amounts unto a <HI>Crime,</HI> for which they are to be Indicted, as <HI>not having the Fear of God before their Eyes.</HI> There are &s;ome Circum|&s;tances of the Day, which may render a Di&s;|cour&s;e on this <HI>Point of Morality,</HI> &s;ingularly Sea|&s;onable. But indeed it were never out of Sea|&s;on. And, I would humbly hope, that not only the <HI>Creditors,</HI> but even the <HI>Debtors</HI> too, will anon be Thankful, for the Advice which is now Faithfully to be di&s;pen&s;ed unto them.</P>
<P>To check the Errors too often committed by <HI>Contracting</HI> of <HI>Debts,</HI> and by <HI>Continuing</HI> in them, I now read unto you a Sentence of the Sacred Oracles, before which we ought all to tremble as before the Vibrations of a Thunder|bolt. It is the <HI>Voice of the ETERNAL,</HI> that is now convey'd unto us, by the Pen of an In&s;pired Apo&s;tle. <HI>The God of Glory Thunders</HI> in it; May His <HI>Voice</HI> be &s;o <HI>Powerful,</HI> as to pro|duce an univer&s;al Compliance among us, an univer&s;al Obedience unto it.</P>
<P>The Spirit of God, who is a <HI>Righteous Lord,</HI> and <HI>Loves Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> does fir&s;t of all direct
<PB N="4" REF="001823_0005_0FB83DEA35E4A950">us, to pay a <HI>Debt</HI> which People owe unto their <HI>Superiours;</HI> That they who &s;erve the <HI>Publick,</HI> and have their <HI>Thought</HI> and their <HI>Time</HI> taken up, in watching for the Safety of the <HI>People,</HI> may be hand&s;omely Sub&s;i&s;ted in their Station. A <HI>Debt</HI> this is, which is not always duely con|&s;idered, nor &s;o hone&s;tly paid as it ought to be! But then, the Direction goes on; That what|ever <HI>Debt</HI> People may owe to <HI>one another,</HI> in the way of their Dealing with <HI>one another,</HI> be al|&s;o duely an&s;wered. People mu&s;t not be in <HI>Debt</HI> unto one another, any further than what is <HI>anovoidable.</HI> 'Tis true, there is One <HI>Debt,</HI> which tho' it &s;hould be ever <HI>Paying,</HI> yet it will be ever <HI>Owing.</HI> A <HI>Debt</HI> of <HI>Love</HI> to one ano|ther. Of this, as <HI>much as you plea&s;e!</HI> But for any other <HI>Debt,</HI> even for that which is a proper <HI>Debt,</HI> Here you cannot be too Cautious. Let Chri&s;tians <HI>come Slowly</HI> into it; and let them <HI>get Quickly</HI> out of it. Let Chri&s;tians Exerci&s;e their <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> in coming in, and their <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> in getting out. Come into it, with the Pace of a <HI>Tortoi&s;e,</HI> and get out of it, with the Flight of an <HI>Eagle.</HI></P>
<P>The DOCTRINE, which I have a &s;uffici|ent Commi&s;&s;ion to in&s;i&s;t upon, is this.</P>
<P><HI>There is a proper Caution, about coming into DEBT, and getting out of DERT, which is a con&s;iderable Point of Chri&s;tianity.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="001823_0006_0FB83DEBB6F8EBF8">
A Due <HI>Caution,</HI> to <HI>Owe no Man any thing,</HI> is what <HI>every Man</HI> &s;hould Labour in. 'Tis the Duty of Chri&s;tians, to have as few <HI>Creditors</HI> as ever they can, and owe as little to their <HI>Cre|ditors</HI> as ever they can, and give none of their <HI>Creditors</HI> any cau&s;e to complain, <HI>That they are not fairly dealt withal.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, There is no need of any Accu|rate E&s;&s;ay, to give a Definition of the DEBT, again&s;t which we are now to be caution'd. The <HI>Lexicons</HI> of the <HI>Lawyers</HI> are needle&s;s to be con&s;ulted on this Occa&s;ion, which will tell us, <HI>Debitor tuus e&s;t, qui tibi non reddit quod tuum e&s;t.</HI> A <HI>Debtor</HI> is One, who does not let another Man have his own; One who does not ren|der to a Neighbour, what he has a claim un|to. They will tell us, A Debt, is what a Man is under Obligation to accommodate another Man withal. Or, <HI>Quod ab Invito Exigi pote&s;t;</HI> What a Man may by <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Right,</HI> be forced whether he will or no, to part withal. The meaning of a DEBT, is too well known, yea, on both &s;ides too <HI>feelingly under&s;tood,</HI> for us to want any Explication of it. Every body knows, That a Man is in <HI>Debt,</HI> when he is <HI>under Obligation to deliver up any Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions unto another Man, upon the Demand thereof.</HI> There are many Ways, in which a Man may come under &s;uch an Obligation; and particularly
<PB N="6" REF="001823_0007_0FB83DED2E423190">&s;uch Ways as tho&s;e wherein <HI>One&s;imus</HI> came in <HI>Debt</HI> unto his Ma&s;ter. But the mo&s;t u&s;ual Way, and that which I have now my Eye mo&s;t upon, is, that of <HI>Agreement with the Cre|ditor.</HI> The <HI>Debt</HI> is indeed, but as an <HI>Embryo,</HI> in its Formation, while the <HI>Time</HI> is not yet come for the Creditor to make his Demand. But it is more fully formed, and makes a ve|ry audible Cry, when a Man witholds from another Man, the <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions,</HI> which ought <HI>Now</HI> to be delivered. This is not only <HI>Being</HI> in <HI>Debt,</HI> but al&s;o <HI>Lying</HI> in <HI>Debt:</HI> And it is to be a|voided with all the <HI>Caution</HI> imaginable. <HI>Chri&s;ti|ans,</HI> You do not an&s;wer your <HI>Worthy Name;</HI> nor come up to that Nece&s;&s;ary Character of <HI>True</HI> and <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Genuine Chri&s;tians,</HI> Heb XIII. 18. <HI>Having a Good Con&s;cience, in all things willing to Live Hone&s;tly;</HI>&mdash;If this <HI>Caution</HI> be a Stran|ger with you.</P>
<P>I hope, no Man will Excu&s;e any Mans not <HI>Paying</HI> what he <HI>Owes,</HI> by the Example of the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> who <HI>Borrowed</HI> of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> with|out making any Re&s;titution. If the Great GOD, who was now become the King of the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> gave His injur'd People a &s;ort of <HI>Letters of Mart,</HI> for them to make Repri&s;als on the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> it was but according to the <HI>Law of Nations.</HI> But &s;ome will maintain, in reali|ty, the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> did not <HI>Borrow</HI> any thing of
<PB N="7" REF="001823_0008_0FB83DEEB1E06EC0">the <HI>Egyptians.</HI> Our Tran&s;lation may be mend|ed. They did not <HI>Borrow,</HI> but <HI>Beg</HI> of them. The &s;ame Word is Tran&s;lated el&s;ewhere, To <HI>Reque&s;t.</HI> The Things which the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> had of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> were not <HI>Lent,</HI> but <HI>Given</HI> to them. When its &s;aid, <HI>They Lent unto them,</HI> it &s;hould be only taken &s;o, <HI>They Accommodated them.</HI></P>
<P>I am aware, That for People to bring them|&s;elves into <HI>Debt,</HI> is not a Thing always For|bidden of God Our Apo&s;tle him&s;elf, who writes to the <HI>Romans, Owe no Man any thing,</HI> yet was willing to bring him&s;elf into <HI>Debt,</HI> upon a Good Occa&s;ion Yea, and into a <HI>Debt</HI> of <HI>Sureti&s;hip</HI> too, which is a Sort of <HI>Debt,</HI> that calls for more <HI>Caution</HI> than any in the World. On the behalf of his Convert, he writes unto <HI>Philemon;</HI> (Ver. 8.) <HI>If he owes thee any thing, put that on mine Account.</HI> It was of Old required by God; Deut. XV. 8 <HI>If there be a poor Man, thou &s;halt &s;urely lend him &s;ufficient for his Need.</HI> Our Saviour has Commanded us. To <HI>Lend</HI> one unto another; Saying, <HI>From him that would Borrow of thee, turn thou not away.</HI> And in His Word, He has Commended, the <HI>Good Man, that Shows Favour and Lendeth;</HI> with an Hint indeed at the &s;ame time, <HI>That we &s;hould guide our Affairs with Di&s;cretion.</HI> But we can't <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> without our Neighbour coming into <HI>Debt</HI> unto us: Which renders it plain. That
<PB N="8" REF="001823_0009_0FB83DF3A4002408">&s;ome <HI>Debt</HI> is to be allowed of. Yea, without &s;ome <HI>Debt,</HI> there could no <HI>Trade</HI> be carried on. It would &s;trangely Cramp the <HI>Trade</HI> of a Peo|ple, if it might be no more than the <HI>Ca&s;h</HI> that is running among them. There may be much <HI>Conveniency</HI> in <HI>Buying,</HI> and &s;ometimes there may be a <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> for <HI>Buying,</HI> when People cannot immediately <HI>Pay</HI> for what they <HI>Buy.</HI> Yea, &s;ince the World &s;o much re&s;olves to <HI>Trade upon Credit,</HI> I will Grant, That a Man of <HI>Capacity</HI> and <HI>Integrity,</HI> that has nothing el&s;e, may &s;ome|times have his <HI>Capacity</HI> and <HI>Integrity</HI> a <HI>Sufficient Fund,</HI> for him to take up thereupon, if his <HI>Cre|ditors</HI> will plea&s;e to have it &s;o. Our <HI>Books of Accounts,</HI> are a very Material part of our <HI>Libra|ries;</HI> and an Excellent Provi&s;ion they are, to carry on a <HI>Lucriferous Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> when 'tis impo&s;&s;i|ble to have <HI>Ca&s;h</HI> at hand, in Proportion to the <HI>Trade</HI> that mult be pro&s;ecuted. And there, if <HI>Di&s;count</HI> pa&s;s for <HI>Good Pay,</HI> I pray, what Hurt is done to any Body? No Body is hurt, if the <HI>Debt</HI> wherewith <HI>Trade</HI> is carryed on, be kept under a <HI>Suitable Regulation.</HI></P>
<P>But, that <HI>Suitable Regulation!</HI> This is what I am now to treat upon.</P>
<P>I Confe&s;s my &s;elf le&s;s competent for a Trea|ti&s;e on &s;uch a Subject, than perhaps many o|thers in the Auditory, For, <HI>I am neither a Tra|der, nor the Son of a Trader.</HI> And yet I am a

<P><HI>A Man that would not be Sinfully in Debt ought to have a Spirit reconciled unto a Low and Mean Condition in the World, if this be what the Glorious GOD &s;hall call him to.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="001823_0014_0FB83DFD088F1DC8">
A grand Cau&s;e of Peoples running into <HI>Debt,</HI> is this; They cannot bear the Humilia|tions of a <HI>Low and a Mean Condition</HI> in the World. E&s;pecially, They that have &s;ometimes Lived in more of Splendor; the&s;e oftentimes find them&s;elves very unable to bear a <HI>Reduced Condition.</HI> This 'tis, that cau&s;es them to run into <HI>Debt.</HI> for the Supply of their <HI>Carnal Appe|tites.</HI> Hence 'tis, that Some who <HI>Live upon other Mens E&s;tates,</HI> go &s;o far in their Extrava|gancy, as to Live Higher than their <HI>Creditors</HI> them&s;elves can do.

Did Men <HI>Love one anotber,</HI> they would not &s;eck to make others become their <HI>Servants,</HI> which you know, <HI>Debtors</HI> are.

<P>I will particularly &s;ay, Tho' <HI>U&s;ury</HI> be Lawful in a Country where Lands may be <HI>Mortgaged</HI> and forever <HI>Alienated;</HI> as they might not in the Land of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> yet there are &s;ome Hard U&s;a|ges in the <HI>U&s;ury,</HI> between the <HI>Creditor</HI> and the <HI>Debtor</HI> among our &s;elves, which the Law of <HI>Love</HI> will never ju&s;tify.</P>
<P>And now, the Minds of People throughout the Country, are greatly engaged in <HI>Projections,</HI> how we &s;hall become furni&s;hed with &s;uch a <HI>Me|dium</HI> of <HI>Trade,</HI> as may prevent an undue Growth of <HI>Debt</HI> among us, I will take the Opportunity to &s;ay; My Brethren, I be &s;eech you, Let not this <HI>Debt</HI> be forgotten, <HI>To Love one another.</HI> There is a <HI>Variety</HI> of Apprehen&s;ions upon the matter.

'Tis a Thing that calls for the mo&s;t awful, Con&s;ideration of <HI>Every Soul</HI> among us; That our <HI>Sins</HI> have brought us into <HI>Debt</HI> unto the <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of the Infinte GOD. There is a <HI>Debt</HI> of <HI>Sufferings,</HI> which we owe to the <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of the In|finite GOD. The <HI>Fenalty</HI> of the <HI>Divine Law,</HI> to which our Sins have made us obnoxious, mu&s;t be Executed. The Honour of the <HI>Holy One,</HI> whom we have Denied &amp; Bla&s;phemed by our Sins, mu&s;t be Vindicated. For the Pay|ment of this <HI>Debt,</HI> there are <HI>Sufferings</HI> to be en|dured, which are, Oh! how Exceedingly to be trembled at! Our <HI>Sins</HI> are called, our <HI>Debts,</HI> becau&s;e they render us fearfully <HI>Indebted</HI> unto the <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of God. Sinner, Thou ha&s;t a <HI>Debt</HI> lying upon thee, which were ponderous enough to break the Backs of all the Angels in Heaven. <HI>Ten Thou&s;and Talents</HI> are but a &s;mall Denomina|tion, for the <HI>Debt</HI> which is oppre&s;&s;ing of thee; the <HI>Debt,</HI> which may make thee cry out, <HI>Lord, I am oppre&s;&s;ed, undertake for me!</HI> Ten Thou&s;and <HI>Mountains</HI> were le&s;s than the light Du&s;t of the Balance, compared unto it. <HI>Thou&s;ands of Rams, Ten Thou&s;ands of Rivers of Oyl;</HI> a Sacrificed Off-&s;pring; a Sacrifice of Myriads of Angels; the whole World made a Sacri&s;ice; all Creatures turn'd into a <HI>Burnt-Offering,</HI> would not make a full Payment of the <HI>Debt.</HI></P>
<P>But, Oh! What an a&s;toni&s;hing thing has been done for us on this tremendous Occa&s;ion! The Eternal
<PB N="30" REF="001823_0031_0FB83E20F62A3DD0">Son of God has a&s;&s;umed our <HI>Nature;</HI> and therein He has become our <HI>Surety.</HI> On a Compact with His Glo|rious Father agreeing unto it, He has taken our <HI>Debt</HI> upon Him. He &s;aid, <HI>Lo, I come to an&s;wer the Debt.</HI> He has done &s;o, in the <HI>Expiatory Sufferings,</HI> wherein He became <HI>Obedient unto Death, even unto the Death of the Cro&s;s:</HI> And He received an <HI>Acquittance,</HI> as having done it, at His <HI>Ro&s;urrection from the Dead.</HI> Oh! wonderful! Oh! wonderful! Our Saviour now invites us, to come, &amp; plead the <HI>Payment</HI> which He has made, that we may be Relea&s;ed from our <HI>Debt,</HI> and <HI>lay hold on Enternal Life.</HI> Oh! Let us now with a lively Faith, make that Prayer to our Saviour, P&s;al CXIX. 122. <HI>Be Surety for thy Servant for Good.</HI> Plead it with the Glo|rious GOD, <HI>Lord, my Saviour has an&s;wered the Demands of thy Law in my Room. Oh! Bring my Soul out of Pri&s;on, that I may prai&s;e thy Name, &amp; Oh! deal bountifully with me.</HI></P>
<P>But then, what a <HI>Debt</HI> of <HI>Love</HI> to Him, who has thus paid our <HI>Debt,</HI> &s;hall we have lying for ever upon us! We mu&s;t own that <HI>Debt</HI> for ever, and the <HI>Love</HI> of our Saviour, in thus <HI>Ran&s;oming</HI> our Souls, it mu&s;t <HI>Con&s;train</HI> us to love Him, &amp; prize Him, &amp; &s;eek Him, &amp; &s;erve Him, and be &s;wallowed up in all po&s;&s;ible Endeavours to Glorify Him. O ye <HI>Ran&s;omed of the Lord;</HI> what will you do now for Him, who has di&s;charged a <HI>Debt</HI> for you; wherein if He had not appeared for you, you mu&s;t have been ca&s;t into an horrible, and an infernal <HI>Pri&s;on,</HI> from whence you could not have come out un|til you had <HI>Paid the uttermo&s;t Farthing:</HI> &mdash; But that,&mdash; What Ages mu&s;t it have called for? &mdash; What will you do, but mo&s;t heartily declare unto him; <HI>Truly, O Lord, I am thy Servant, I am thy Servant, &s;ince thou ha&s;t loo&s;ed my Ponds; Oh! may I be entirely Thine forever more!</HI></P>
