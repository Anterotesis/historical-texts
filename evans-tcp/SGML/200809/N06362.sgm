<OPENER><SALUTE>FRIEND <HI>TAYLOR,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Have read over thy Sermon, which thou did&s;t preach, or read, to thy people, at the open|ing thy New Place, which, thou ha&s;t named by the name of CHAPPEL: doubtle&s;s to remind all men, that the doctrine common|ly taught there; is Popi&s;h Doctrine: I do not mean, that thou teache&s;t Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation; or Obedience to the Pope of <HI>Rome;</HI> for thou art evidently, too much a Pope thy &s;elf, to be &s;ubject to another; and art too much devoted to the Godde&s;s <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> to admit of any my&s;tery, much le&s;s ab&s;urdity into thy Creed. It was in thy heart, to read a Sermon to thy people, on the occa|&s;ion; it was not well, it was in thy heart to do &s;o; for I am afraid, it was the pride of thy heart to do &s;o; to chu&s;e to do it thy &s;elf, rather than employ any one of thy friends, in &s;uch a &s;ervice; which thou knowe&s;t, is the u&s;ual cu&s;tom, among&s;t thy fraternity. Indeed friend <HI>John,</HI> though thy principles are pretty much the &s;ame with ours, I am &s;urpriz'd at thy vanity in being &s;o taken with a gaudy, &s;howy, co&s;tly building: this is quite in|con&s;i&s;tent with thy other preten&s;ions. Thou may&s;t talk of humility, 'till thy tongue aches, no body can or will think thee to be in earne&s;t, while thy prie&s;tly robes and co&s;tly temple do evidently &s;o much ingro&s;s thy th&ocirc;ts. Be advi&s;ed by me neighbour <HI>John</HI> and pull off thy ma&s;k; lay a&s;ide thy prie&s;tly garments; put on a plain Lay-dre&s;s, and come among us; we will receive thee:
<PB N="2" REF="008069_0005_102FC787871A34F0">
thy rea&s;on and our Light within will very well agree. I am a little afraid thou wilt make poor work of the Spi|rit and his operations, but if thou wilt but be teachable, we will &s;oon put thee into the way of it. Pray friend <HI>John</HI> how came&s;t thou to chu&s;e to be called Chri&s;tian? or what right ha&s;t thou to that name any more than we? Thou denie&s;t original &s;in, &s;o do we: thou denie&s;t im|puted righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;o do we; thou denie&s;t Chri&s;t's &s;atisfaction, &s;o do we: thou expecte&s;t to be &s;aved by thy own righteou&s;ne&s;s, and for thy own good deeds, &s;o do we. In &s;hort thou denie&s;t almo&s;t all the doct|rines which are well known among Prote&s;tants by the name of <HI>the great doctrines of the reformation from Popery;</HI> &s;o do we; becau&s;e they are contrary to our <HI>Light within;</HI> and thou denie&s;t them becau&s;e they are contrary to thy rea&s;on: &s;o then our <HI>Light within</HI> and thy <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> &s;eem to be much the &s;ame. Why then do&s;t thou not come among us, to whom thou do&s;t evi|dently &s;o naturally belong? Or art thou determin'd to increa&s;e the number of &s;ectaries, and to the Epi&s;co|parians, Pre&s;byterians, Independants, Anabapti&s;ts, Cal|vini&s;ts, Arians, Trinitarians, Whitfilites, We&s;tleites, add the venerable name of <HI>Talorians: Taylor!</HI> a mo&s;t re&s;pectable name; the mo&s;t ancient name in the world; our father <HI>Adam</HI> being by trade a Taylor, which by the way, is the mo&s;t reputable bu&s;ine&s;s with all rational beings, becau&s;e entirely natural. Happy man therefore art thou in this thy name, and art evidently as much de|&s;ign'd to be the head of a party, as ever <HI>Adam</HI> was to be the father of po&s;terity: and certainly more fit for it, fora&s;much as thou art wi&s;er than <HI>Adam;</HI> for with|out flattery, I think it more rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e thee as wi&s;e as Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> than it was for thee to &s;uppo&s;e him wi&s;er than <HI>Adam;</HI> and to be plain with thee, and convince thee that I flatter thee not, I &s;hould be of the &s;ame mind if I knew thee to be a fool.</P>
<P>But I &s;ay to thee again; pull off thy ma&s;k and be
<PB N="3" REF="008069_0006_102FC78ED2366638">
not a&s;hamed to declare thy &s;elf either a Quaker or a Romi&s;h prie&s;t. How do&s;t thou dare to call thy &s;elf Chri&s;tian, when thou knowe&s;t in thy own heart that thou believe&s;t not the peculiar doctrines of chri&s;tianity? which we al&s;o believe not, and for this plain rea&s;on as I &s;aid before, becau&s;e our <HI>Light within,</HI> as thy <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> comprehendeth them not.</P>
<P>Thou did&s;t publi&s;h as I am told, &s;ome years ago, <HI>The A&s;&s;embly's Catechi&s;m revi&s;ed and rendered fitter for General U&s;e;</HI> by what authority thou did&s;t do it, no body knows but thy &s;elf, though any body may &s;up|po&s;e by the contents of that performance, it was done by the command of the Pope of <HI>Rome;</HI> it being direct|ly contrary to reformation-principles.</P>
<P>Thou art now publi&s;hing a very Great Work, and as thou woulde&s;t have the world believe, a very learn|ed work, <HI>A Hebrew Bible Dictionary;</HI> I will recom|mend to thee as the la&s;t work of thy life, and to com|pleat all thy works, to publi&s;h <HI>The Holy Bible revi&s;ed and made more fit for General U&s;e:</HI> As it now &s;tands it is by no means fit for thy purpo&s;e; witne&s;s the dreadful havock thou ha&s;t made with <HI>P&s;al,</HI> li. ver. 5.</P>
<P>But I forget my &s;elf: thou art an oracle, and as &s;uch, to be con&s;ulted by all thy votaries, th&ocirc; they may all &s;pare their pains, for two words are the &s;um of all thou ha&s;t to &s;ay. <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Candour; Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Candour; Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Candour;</HI> and the mi&s;chief of all is thou meane&s;t no more by them than the mad-brain'd <HI>Ephe|&s;ian</HI> mob did by <HI>Great is Diana of the Ephe&s;ians.</HI></P>
<P>Be hone&s;t, open and free then my dear friend, tell the world what thou art, but for &s;hame call not thy &s;elf Chri&s;tian: for why &s;hould&s;t thou arrogate this name to thy &s;elf any more than we? we do not profe&s;s our &s;elves Chri&s;tians; we believe Je&s;us of <HI>Nazareth</HI> to have been a very good man, to have &s;et a noble ex|ample of patience, humility, obedience, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but we have no dependance on him, we put no tru&s;t in him
<PB N="4" REF="008069_0007_102FC79055D658E8">
any more than thou do&s;t. Poor <HI>Paul</HI> indeed in an en|thu&s;ia&s;tical fit, cries out: <HI>I know whom I have tru&s;ted, and I am per&s;waded he is able to keep that which I have committed to him again&s;t that day.</HI> And <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> in the &s;ame &s;ort of paroxi&s;m, cries out, <HI>Tru&s;t ye in the Lord for ever; for in the Lord Jehovah is everla&s;t|ing &s;trength.</HI> But then you know <HI>Paul</HI> was a Chri&s;tian profe&s;t, a rank one, ready to &s;acrifice every thing to the cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity: declar'd its doctrines di&s;agreable as they were to the prejudiced rea&s;on of men of cor|rupt minds: own'd him&s;elf a believer of them, though they were to the fooli&s;h infidel Jews a &s;tumbling-block, and to the wi&s;e rational Greeks fooli&s;hne&s;s. So they were in the apo&s;tolic age: &s;o they &s;till are to you and me; and to all in our way; nor can I &s;ee any help for it; &s;ince it is evident beyond all contradiction that Chri&s;tianity propo&s;es &s;uch principles which thy <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and my <HI>Light within</HI> can never admit. That Je&s;us Chri&s;t is truly God, the creator of all things vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible, is plainly enough taught in the old and new te&s;tament, but neither our <HI>Light within,</HI> nor thy Rea&s;on can comprehend how this can be; and therefore we leave it to the faith of men, who believe any thing that God declares, however my&s;terious and incomprehen&s;i|ble, to credit what we can give no credit to; our <HI>Light within</HI> and thy <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> are both &s;uperiour to any reve|lation, ju&s;t as a judge is &s;uperior to the coun&s;ellors, to the lawyers, yea to the poor criminals he is to try. In|deed, there is this difference between thee and us: we have try'd revelation, and find it contains &s;uch principles as our <HI>Light within</HI> calls ab&s;urd, therefore like hone&s;t men we gravely di&s;card it. But thou and tho&s;e in thy way have the impudence of ten thou&s;and harlots, while with brows of bra&s;s ye hold the Bible in your hands, tell the world <HI>that</HI> contains your religion; and at the &s;ame time deny all its peculiar, and di&s;tingui&s;h|ing doctrines. This! this! is that which has fill'd this
<PB N="5" REF="008069_0008_102FC79449247828">
land with Athei&s;ts; this is the cur&s;ed root of that infi|delity now prevailing in the world: this! this! is the ma&s;ter-piece of the old &s;erpent's &s;ubtilty, who hath been for a long time let loo&s;e to deceive the nations.</P>
<P>Surely, friend <HI>John,</HI> it is time to lay the&s;e things to heart, to think &s;eriou&s;ly what the i&s;&s;ue of the&s;e practi|ces will be: thou ha&s;t the art of writing very &s;olemn|ly, and if thou art not &s;incere in what thou write&s;t, thou art a very bad man indeed: but thou knowe&s;t thy &s;elf to mean as thou &s;aye&s;t; and this is to be thy excu&s;e, how wrong &s;oever thou art.</P>
<P>But pray, neighbour <HI>John,</HI> was not <HI>Paul,</HI> whom thou ha&s;t lucubrated on, &s;incere when a per&s;ecutor? Yea, thou wilt &s;ay, and a good man too; tho&s;e in thy way &s;ay &s;o; but pray now, are we to credit thee and them, or the apo&s;tle him&s;elf? I &s;uppo&s;e thou think|e&s;t it was his mode&s;ty that made him &s;ay, <HI>I obtained mercy, becau&s;e I did it ignorantly in unbelief;</HI> but let me tell thee, thy thinking, and the thinking of tho&s;e in thy way is no rule, or &s;tandard of truth. And unle&s;s truth and fal&s;ehood, good and evil be the &s;ame, it is my opinion, <HI>Paul</HI> was not a good man, 'till he was convert|ed; and I am &s;ure he him&s;elf thought &s;o. But thou art a very wi&s;e man, and ha&s;t gotten a key, a well wro't one too, to the apo&s;tolick writings: thou wa&s;t, doubt|le&s;s, brought up at the feet of <HI>Gamaliel,</HI> a cotempo|rary with the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul;</HI> or like him ha&s;t been caught up to heaven, and there conver&s;ed with <HI>Paul,</HI> who, has told thee how to explain the go&s;pel &s;cheme, and the principal words and phra&s;es, the apo&s;tles have u&s;ed in de&s;cribing it. I wi&s;h then thou would&s;t be &s;o hone&s;t as to u&s;e words and phra&s;es as they are common|ly under&s;tood, and do not any longer be &s;o wicked as to u&s;e words and phra&s;es with thy own meaning affixed to them; which meaning, no body thinks of but thy &s;elf, and tho&s;e in thy way, nor ever thought of 'till thou <HI>Great Genius</HI> aro&s;e to enlighten the dark and be|nighted world.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="008069_0009_102FC795CD720828">
Take heed, neighbour <HI>John,</HI> thou art upon a dange|rous pinnacle, the pinnacle of pride; thou boa&s;te&s;t thy &s;elf to be &s;omebody, &amp; thou &amp; thy admirers are great folks in your own opinions; but great as thou art, thy pride may be &s;oon aba&s;ed: and thy &s;cheme, fond as thou art of it, may be brought to nought. Some people think, fine as it is, and plea&s;ing to the pride and flattery of hu|man nature, that it is built on the &s;and, and therefore cannot &s;tand, when ever a &s;torm comes, but will cer|tainly fall, <HI>and great will be the fall thereof.</HI> &mdash; Do&s;t thou really think that thou under&s;tande&s;t the <HI>Greek</HI> lan|guage better than any one el&s;e? or that none read the <HI>Greek</HI> Te&s;tament but thee and thy friends, that thou take&s;t upon thee to be &s;uch a dictator, and to write all that thou write&s;t in &s;uch a magi&s;terial &s;train? Surely more humble and candid language would better corre&s;|pond with thy preten&s;ions; e&s;pecially as thou art aim|ing to introduce an <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ion, and &s;uch a one as was &s;carce ever heard of before, which yet will not be compleat if thou leave&s;t the Athei&s;t and the devil out of it.</P>
<P>I cannot conceive, friend <HI>John,</HI> why thou and thy friends have been at &s;o great expence in procuring the noble&s;t place of the kind, for thee and tho&s;e in thy way to &s;peak in: this could not proceed from &s;uch a &s;pirit and temper as thy ma&s;ter po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. I &s;uppo&s;e in the city where thou dwelle&s;t, a place good enough for thee to &s;peak in and for thy friends to hear, might have been well fini&s;hed for fifteen hundred pounds, what account then will ye give to your Great Lord and final Judge for two thou&s;and pounds and upwards, &s;unk and wa&s;ted, which might have been a noble generous fund for the poor? Or may be ye are all rich; have no poor among you, yet as the whole world are God's offspring and we are all one common fraternity, I think it would have been a noble, generous, di&s;intere&s;ted &s;cheme to have two thou&s;and pounds or more, as a fund, rai&s;ed by a few profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians at <HI>Norwich,</HI> on pur|po&s;e

to relieve any di&s;tre&s;&s;ed among mankind all the world over. By this means thy name would found to the ends of the earth, and thy remembrance la&s;t from generation to generation: but thy humanity and uni|ver&s;al love doth not yet extend it &s;elf &s;o far: may be ye will do this al&s;o, and verily if what I write &s;hould put it into your heads, for without doubt ye have it in your hearts naturally; genero&s;ity, humanity, benevo|lence, boundle&s;s and univer&s;al love growing in their native &s;oil. I &s;ay, if what I write &s;hould put it into your head to rai&s;e a fund for the purpo&s;e above-men|tioned, I &s;hall think my &s;elf amply rewarded for my trouble, in having the ble&s;&s;ings of the poor &s;o long as the world endureth.&mdash;</P>
<P>As thy principles are &s;o diametrically oppo&s;ite to the articles of the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Creed, it was very politick in thee to declare thy re&s;pect for king GEORGE, who&s;e mild and merciful government gives thee liberty to be any thing but a profe&s;t Athei&s;t, and to write any thing except direct Infidelity. But give me leave to tell thee that thou art quite mi&s;taken in thinking that what thou ha&s;t written is generally approved, for bad as this kingdom is, there are thou&s;ands and ten thou&s;ands in it who hate thy principles almo&s;t as they hate Athei&s;m it &s;elf, and Great as thou thinke&s;t thy &s;elf to be, regard thee in this very di&s;agreeable view, as fatan him&s;elf transformed into an angel of light: When thou pub|li&s;he&s;t again I would like to &s;ee thy paraphra&s;e on this pa&s;&s;age, and that thou would&s;t tell the world what &s;ort of Being the devil is when &s;o transformed; and whether this re&s;pects his intellectual or practical conduct. Thy key will undoubtedly do here, being a key of the mo&s;t excellent temperature, and workman&s;hip, &s;o admirably contrived, as to be able to unlock every hard and diffi|cult pa&s;&s;age, however hamper'd, or cover'd over with Calvinian &s;uper&s;tition or Reformation ru&s;t. Thy key of knowledge will do wonderful things, it would if

po&s;&s;ible make light darkne&s;s, good evil, truth error; at lea&s;t it will do its utmo&s;t to confound the&s;e things to blend them together, and &s;o make it &s;till more difficult to the human mind to di&s;tingui&s;h one from the other. No man talks more of truth than thou do&s;t, and no man &s;eems to under&s;tand what truth is, le&s;s than thy &s;elf: I mean, if Revelation be the &s;tandard of truth; but if thy <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> of the men in <HI>thy way,</HI> as our <HI>inward Light,</HI> be the &s;tandard, then for ought I know thou may&s;t under&s;tand what truth is as well as any &s;ince the days of <HI>Lock</HI> and <HI>Newton:</HI> but then thou knowe&s;t the&s;e men's <HI>Light,</HI> like thine and ours, was &s;uperior to that of Revelation, &s;o not to be re|gulated by it. It is by thy <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> that thou judge&s;t of Revelation and all the doctrines therein contained: what thou finde&s;t there which thy <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> can take up and account for rationally, that thou give&s;t credit to, but wherever Revelation for&s;akes thy <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> or &s;oars above it, there thou for&s;ake&s;t that and gette&s;t a|bove it too; &s;o art even. This is thy manner, and this ours, and &s;urely this is the right way of proceeding: for any doctrine which we cannot clearly take in, or which rea&s;on, every man's rea&s;on cannot as clearly and as rationally under&s;tand as that two and two are equal to four, can be no doctrine for rational Beings to give credit to.</P>
<P>This then at one happy &s;troke cuts off the common|ly received doctrines of the Trinity, the true and proper Diety of the Son and Spirit two natures in Chri&s;t: ori|ginal &s;in, imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s, ju&s;tification by faith; particular election; efficacious grace; regeneration and conver&s;ion; &s;anctification by the Spirit's influences; and final per&s;everance; and having &s;trip'd Chri&s;tianity of the&s;e exere&s;&s;ences, which like Wens on the body have been long a mo&s;t grievous incumbrance, it leaves it a mo&s;t delightful &s;y&s;tem of <HI>Pagani&s;m improv'd.</HI></P>

I find I mu&s;t call back one &s;entiment expre&s;s'd in the beginning of this my Epi&s;tle: namely that the Godde&s;s Rea&s;on will not &s;uffer thee to admit any ab&s;urdity into thy Creed. Now on &s;econd thoughts I find thou ha&s;t admitted an ab&s;urdity as great as can be invented: and this thy boa&s;ted rea&s;on can admit, which like the rea|&s;on of a Roman Catholick, can admit of any thing but truth and found divinity. But what is this ab&s;urdity thou wilt &s;ay? why truly nothing le&s;s than this, that the Creator is a Creature, that he that made the worlds was made him&s;elf; in &s;hort, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is an in|ferior God: now I defy thee and all the men in thy way to produce a greater ab&s;urdity than this. Thou had&s;t much better with us, be con&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on, and declare he is no God at all, for nothing is more plain than this, that Revelation declares for one God, Fa|ther, Son and Holy Gho&s;t. Indeed this is not ratio|nal according as rea&s;on is now in man; but that it is &s;criptural is as plain as that there is any &s;uch book called the Bible.</P>
<P>Pray now my friend, think of this a little more, and con&s;ider what thou meane&s;t by calling thy &s;elf Chri&s;tian, and at the &s;ame time betraying thy ma&s;ter's cau&s;e; call|ing thy &s;elf Chri&s;tian, and at the &s;ame time di&s;carding from thy Creed, (for a Creed thou ha&s;t as well as other men), almo&s;t every Notion, almo&s;t every Principle that is properly Chri&s;tian. I wonder what thy friends <HI>Owen, Howe, Charnock</HI> or <HI>Flavel,</HI> would &s;ay to thee, if they were now in our world: they were Chri&s;tians and only Chri&s;tians as well as thee, but I &s;uppo&s;e thy vanity prompts thee to &s;u&s;pect that they under&s;tood nothing of Chri&s;tianity comparatively with thee. This I am &s;ure of, if they were in the <HI>main Right,</HI> thou art in the <HI>main Wrong,</HI> unle&s;s right and wrong be &s;ynonimous terms, and I almo&s;t think they are &s;o with thee; for if thou live&s;t a little longer, and write&s;t a little more, I &s;hall expect to &s;ee a pamphlet intitled, <HI>John again&s;t

<P>Indeed neighbour, I would gladly excu&s;e thee, and think the be&s;t of thee I po&s;&s;ibly can; but thou art verily too guilty in this re&s;pect and very often, in the cour&s;e of thy lucubrations, when thy argument runs &s;adly low, thy a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;urprize and wonder, thy cen&s;ure, reproach and ridicule run much too high: I do not &s;ay too high for thy Subject, but too high for thy preten&s;ions; thy preten&s;ions I mean, to candour, &s;oftne&s;s and moderation. But po&s;&s;ibly the&s;e and &s;uch|like words were the fir&s;t words that thou did&s;t learn to &s;peak, and as thou had&s;t no ideas connected with them in thy infant &s;tate, &s;o thou ha&s;t forgotten all thy life long to mean any thing by them, or po&s;&s;ibly they are words u&s;ed by thee, as many other words are both in conver|&s;ation and writing, as expletives, and &s;o are de&s;igned for &s;ound, or to fill up a &s;entence, rather than to convey any &s;en&s;e or meaning: Be this as it will, I would advi&s;e thee for the future, in all thy publications, to put at the be|ginning or end of thy performance, an alphabet of all dubious or equivocal words thou u&s;e&s;t; that &s;o thyreader may certainly &amp; infallibly know what thou meane&s;t by what thou &s;aye&s;t, for hitherto many, very many of tho&s;e who read thy lucubrations are greatly in the dark as to this: in my opinion thou do&s;t not u&s;e thy friends well in

<P>There is one thing more I mu&s;t not forget to hint to thee, and to the men in thy way.

Thou knowe&s;t be&s;t what end thou ha&s;t in what thou doe&s;t, but if thou really thinke&s;t that the truth of God will more abound thr&ocirc; thy lie, let me tell thee thou art greatly mi&s;taken, for truth needeth no covering, no deceit, no fraud to recommend it. Thou ha&s;t the more rea&s;on to be open, hone&s;t and free, be|cau&s;e thy king and country give thee leave to be &s;o. In &s;ome former reigns the ca&s;e was otherwi&s;e, but thou ha&s;t no temptation now, to write or &s;peak aenigmatically.

Surely if thy &s;uppo&s;itions be true, it had been better for the world to have re|mained Heathens, and to have continued in their Ido|latry and Super&s;tition, than that Chri&s;tianity &s;hould ever have been introduced, e&s;pecially as according to thy notion of things the generality of chri&s;tians have been the mo&s;t wicked, lewd, bloody and treacherous

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT. A SHORT DIALOGUE between Mr. TIMOTHY TELL-TRUTH and OBADIAH FRIENDLY.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obadiah.</SPEAKER>
<P>PRAY Neighbour <HI>Timothy</HI> ha&s;t thou &s;een the friendly Epi&s;tle to Neighbour <HI>John Taylor,</HI> in which he is invited to come among us <HI>Quakers?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Timothy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have ju&s;t been reading it over, and an odd Medley it is; for the Man is &s;ometimes &s;o low and gro|veling, &s;o mean and weak in his Sen&s;e and Sentiments, that one can &s;carce have Patience to read any further: At other Times he is &s;o &s;everely &s;atyrical, that one cannot help going through with it, becau&s;e Partiality it&s;elf mu&s;t confe&s;s that the Satyr is as ju&s;t as it is poinant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obad.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou &s;aye&s;t ju&s;t; but I hope thou do&s;t not mean that his Satyr on us <HI>Quakers</HI> is as ju&s;t as on our worthy Friend <HI>J. Taylor;</HI> for have we ever refu&s;ed to be called Chri&s;tians, or do we di&s;claim a Right to the Chri&s;tian Name, as he &s;eems to in&s;inuate? Surely if we believe in the Chri&s;t within, the Light which hath lightened every Man that hath come into the World, from <HI>Adam</HI> the fir&s;t Man down to the pre&s;ent Day, we may call our &s;elves Chri&s;tians, and be deemed &s;o by others as well as any People what&s;oever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will promi&s;e you that I will not di&s;pute that Mat|ter with you, yet I think it is very plain your Friend <HI>Adam|&s;on</HI> regards him&s;elf and his Friends as Dei&s;ts, and his Neigh|bour <HI>Taylor</HI> as little otherwi&s;e, and I will freely declare to you, as you put me on this Conver&s;ation, that I have long thought that your Principles and his equally dei&s;tical &amp; popi&s;h.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obad.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee now, Friend <HI>Timothy,</HI> do not call <HI>M. Adam|&s;on</HI> my Friend, he is no more my Friend than he is thine, for it is very plain he is no <HI>Quaker,</HI> nor does he &s;eem to un|der&s;tand either our Scheme or Friend <HI>Taylor</HI>'s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whether he is a <HI>Quaker</HI> or no I think he has &s;aid nothing but what many <HI>Quakers,</HI> if they would &s;peak out, and &s;peak hone&s;tly, would &s;ay too; and, if I gue&s;s right, he knows your Scheme and your Friend <HI>Taylor</HI>'s too, rather better than you chu&s;e he &s;hould, if you have any Scheme at all.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Obad.</SPEAKER>
<P>Any Scheme at all, Neighbour! Why what do'&s;t mean by that? Do'&s;t que&s;tion whether we have any Scheme? Whether Friend <HI>Taylor</HI> has any Scheme too? Why thee talk'&s;t &s;trangely now! Why every body has got &s;ome Scheme; even Satan hath his Scheme both of Principles and Conduct; but why do&s;t thou que&s;tion whether we have any Scheme?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will tell you very plainly my Thoughts of this. When the ancient approv'd Scheme is ca&s;t off, there are &s;uch a Multiplicity of others invented, that the feeble Mind is pre&s;ently confu&s;ed among the &s;en&s;ele&s;s Jargon; yet deter|mined at all Events the old one &s;hall not do, for no other Rea&s;on but becau&s;e it is old, therefore antiquated, unfit for U&s;e; in this Situation the Man ca&s;ts in his Mind what is be&s;t to be done, and that he may appear &s;omebody, he con&s;ults every Scheme he can happen on; he takes a Piece here and a Piece there, &s;ome of this, &s;ome of that, and &s;ome of t'other; he compounds them together, and a glorious Mixture he has got; it is neither one thing nor another, while aiming at every Thing it is nothing; a Compound of every Thing, yet nothing to any Purpo&s;e; a &s;canty Lin|&s;ey-wool&s;ey Garment, which will &s;carce cover the Naked|ne&s;s of the Wearer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obad.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;orry, Neighbour <HI>Timothy,</HI> to hear thee talk at this rate, thou do&s;t not u&s;e to be &s;o cen&s;orious; and I am afraid, as thou ha&s;t been reading the friendly Epi&s;tle, thou art &s;omewhat leavened with the &s;ame Leaven which runs through that unintelligible Medley.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed you are quite mi&s;taken; for I was of the &s;ame Mind long before I &s;aw that; yet I am free to own to you that has abundantly confirmed to me what I thought before; and I fully believe that you and the new-&s;cheme Men have no Scheme at all, or &s;uch as is ju&s;t like none.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obad.</SPEAKER>
<P>New-&s;cheme-men! Pray who or what are they? that thou conecte&s;t them and us together! I have often heard of them and heartily wi&s;h I knew what Account to make of them. As thou ha&s;t mentioned them, I wi&s;h thou would&s;t &s;atisfy me about them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Depend on it my good Neighbour, any Thing I can give you Intelligence of, or acquaint you with, I &s;hall be very ready to do to the utmo&s;t of my Power, and I ex|pect the &s;ame from you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obad.</SPEAKER>
<P>On this Condition all is well, we are agreed, there|fore pray go on.</P>

<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>You want to know who or what the new Scheme|men are: As to who, I am not &s;o well acquainted with the Inhabitants of the Earth as to point out one in a Thou&s;and: Doubtle&s;s your Friend <HI>Taylor</HI> is one of the chief; at lea&s;t he would have it thought that what he has advanced is new: Witne&s;s what he &s;ays in the 6th Page of one of his Pamphlets, viz. <Q>When I fir&s;t &s;aw the&s;e Things I did not know that any one Per&s;on in the World had di&s;cover'd them be&s;ide my&s;elf.</Q> And le&s;t any body el&s;e in his way &s;hould be wi&s;er than him&s;elf, if I am not mi&s;inform'd, it has been his Advice to young Mini&s;ters not to con&s;ult the old Divines, but rather the Moderns. And indeed had he con&s;ulted the old Writers, he mu&s;t have found tho&s;e very Things &s;olidly confuted which he has the Vanity to palm upon the World as quite new: And thus his Ignorance or want of reading mu&s;t be his Apology for troubling the World with his Dreams.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obad.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why <HI>Timothy,</HI> if thou do&s;t not take Care, thou wilt be as unmannerly &amp; &s;currilous as <HI>M. Adam&s;on:</HI> Surely thee &s;hould&s;t con&s;ider that our Friend <HI>Taylor</HI> in a worthy Citizen, a venerable old Man, and therefore not to be treated with Contempt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have often heard this remark'd, and po&s;&s;ibly there may be &s;ome Ju&s;tice in it; but then I think your Friend <HI>Taylor</HI> him&s;elf has pav'd the Way for it, in treating the vene|rable A&s;&s;embly of Divines in the manner he has done; &s;o that he is only &s;erv'd as he has &s;erv'd others by far his Superiors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obad.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what are the new Scheme-men there is &s;o much talk about? What are they doing of? What are they after?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe they don't know them&s;elves, therefore I can give you but a very imperfect Account of them: I know but of one thing wherein they are all agreed; and that is, to treat with Contempt and Di&s;grace the Great Author of the Chri&s;tian Religion; to bla&s;pheme the holy Name whereby Chri&s;tians are called. The Monthly Reviewers are notorious In&s;tances of this &s;ort. With them, who ever writes any thing again&s;t Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is a mo&s;t accom|pli&s;h'd, accurate Writer, a Man of very great Sagacity and deep Learning, of incomparable Abilities and refin'd Sen&s;e, extremely judicious and preci&s;ely di&s;cerning: While who|ever writes any thing in Honour of the divine Saviour, is
<PB N="23" REF="008069_0026_102FC7D51A9D2BE0">
with them an enthu&s;ia&s;tical Idiot, a &s;tupid, dull Drone, or a pious Fool: Witne&s;s their unparralel'd prejudic'd bigotted Accounts of the Writings of the judicious Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Brine</HI> and <HI>Wil&s;on;</HI> of hone&s;t <HI>John <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">;</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>Whitfield, Romaine</HI> and <HI>Jones,</HI> and the ju&s;tly admir'd Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Hervey:</HI> And the Writings of that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> Soldier <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>R&mdash;d B&mdash;r&mdash;n;</HI> that Lin&s;ey-wool&s;ey-Weaver Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash;<HI>g,</HI> and the accompli&s;h'd Orator Mr. <HI>Charles B</HI>&mdash; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and all the new-Scheme-writers, from your old arch Friend Dr. <HI>John Taylor</HI> of <HI>Norwich,</HI> down to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Taoalttbob</HI> of pre|cious Memory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obad.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wor&s;e and wor&s;e &s;till, Friend <HI>Timothy,</HI> I cannot bear to hear thee rail on in this manner, again&s;t the greate&s;t Writers of the Age; Men, who&s;e every Page is filled with Wi&s;dom, Morals, Candour, Virtue and Sen&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot help that my good Neighbour; if you cannot bear to hear the Truth, that is no Rea&s;on why I &s;hould not tell you the Truth, e&s;pecially when you a&s;k'd me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obad.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! If I had thought thee woulded&s;t have talked in this manner, I am &s;ure I never had a&s;ked thee after the&s;e Men or their Scheme.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if you had not a&s;ked me I had been &s;ilent enough about the Matter I do a&s;&s;ure you: But I hate Flat|tery and always did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obad.</SPEAKER>
<P>Flattery! Friend <HI>Timothy;</HI> it is well known thou art no Flatterer any more than <HI>M. Adam&s;on;</HI> but never|thele&s;s ye ought to treat People with Good manners and not to abu&s;e them; therefore farewell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>O good bye t'e Neighbour, for I find you cannot bear plain dealing; nor to have the Truth told you when it touches thy &s;elf or any of tho&s;e you have &s;o great a Re|gard for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obad.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fare thee well I &s;ay, and I wi&s;h thee more Candour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stupidity, Ignorance, you mean, only you have learn'd to call things by wrong Names.</P>
