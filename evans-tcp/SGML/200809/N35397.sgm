<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HEARING an <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> &s;ay, that he u&s;ed not the excellencies of &s;peech, nor the enticing words of man's wi&s;dom, when he came preaching the Go&s;pel of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> among&s;t the Gentiles: I conclude, that what was <HI>then</HI> u&s;ele&s;s, is altogether as unnece&s;&s;ary <HI>now.</HI> Truth needs no art, but manife&s;ts it&s;elf by plainne&s;s of &s;peech, in the demon&s;tration of the Spirit, and of Power.</P>
<P>I believe I may &s;ay, without unchari|table cen&s;ure, that mankind in the gene|ral, judge according to appearance, and not with righteous judgment; the flowery &s;tile, the &s;welling word of vanity alluring to the fle&s;h, is that, which, (by rea&s;on of the depraved &s;en&s;es) is mo&s;t plea&s;ing to the ear, and &s;triking to the mind, it be|ing not important, whether it contains any matter or not: The Truth it&s;elf, being &s;eldom that which the reader falls in love with; it is language, founds, and pomp of words, that enamours a flattering world.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="046269_0003_1021159E3ABD0878">
To urge, that the allurements and ele|gance of &s;peech adorns the Truth, and removing the prejudice which many have conceived again&s;t it, excites them to read with delight, &amp;c. I &s;ay, this plea will be found upon impartial inquiry, to be a flat contradiction of the &s;criptures, a &s;tale device of Truth's grand enemy: For let the <HI>&s;ame &s;ubject,</HI> be but treated of in the true apo&s;tolic language, viz. plain|ne&s;s of &s;peech; and tho&s;e raptured ad|mirers of the &s;ublime, however nervous its argument, will reject it.</P>
<P>To a&s;&s;ert that the excellency of &s;peech, and the enticing words of man's wi&s;dom, is nece&s;&s;ary to enforce the Truths of the Go&s;pel; is to impeach the judgment of one who&s;e choice did not proceed of nece&s;&s;ity, when he cho&s;e plainne&s;s of &s;peech, &s;uch as was familiar to the mean|e&s;t capacity; I mean the apo&s;tle to the Gentiles; he looked on the enticements of &s;peech, as a proceeding unworthy the maje&s;ty of his matter, yea rather <HI>hurtful</HI> than <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> unto his hearers; left their faith &s;hould &s;tand in the wi&s;dom of man, and not in the power of God. Hence I am encouraged to hope, that the ab&s;ence <PB N="v" REF="046269_0004_102115A325C743C0">of tho&s;e embelli&s;hments from my Trea|ti&s;e, (though it proceed of nece&s;&s;ity) will neither marr the beauty, nor relax the nerves of Truth contained therein: And, what further con&s;pires to render my ex|pectations &s;anguine in this particular, is the per&s;ua&s;ion, that there are &s;uch in the world, who&s;e ears cannot be charmed with dead unmeaning &s;ounds, and who&s;e hearts are &s;u&s;ceptible of Truth, in its artle&s;s native dre&s;s.</P>
<P>But as the <HI>multitude</HI> think otherwi&s;e, and are contrary to <HI>me;</HI> in the grace and love of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> I &s;tand prepared for cen&s;ure, and reproach, and am not afraid of their utmo&s;t enmity: nor is it in the <HI>power</HI> of the world to <HI>torment</HI> me with di&s;appointments, becau&s;e my ex|pectations are &s;uited to their candour and clemency.</P>
<P>Through the knowledge of my&s;elf, and the ob&s;ervation I have made in life, I under&s;tand a little of human nature; and having learned of the Father, am not altogether ignorant of him who is the Truth: I therefore perceive, that <HI>reproach</HI> and the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> are in&s;eparably <PB N="vi" REF="046269_0005_102115A66D0A2AA8">connected; that it is impo&s;&s;ible to be|lieve, and bear witne&s;s of the <HI>one,</HI> without being expo&s;ed to the virulence of the <HI>other,</HI> therefore God forbid that I &s;hould &s;eek to avoid it, but rather meet it re|joicing, and receive it with open arms; being thereby crucified unto the world, and the world unto me.</P>
<P>As I make no preten&s;ion to infallibi|lity, nay as I pretend not to the abilities of fallible authors: re&s;pecting wi&s;dom, and Letters, it will not &s;urpri&s;e me, nor need it &s;urpri&s;e any <HI>body e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e,</HI> if &s;ome bu&s;y critic, who&s;e genius leads him ever in &s;earch of offal, and garbage, &s;hould pre|tend to detect in my book, not only bad grammar, with inaccuracies in phra&s;e; but errors in judgment al&s;o: Nor &s;hall this trouble me, provided he &s;ub&s;titute in&s;tead thereof, what con&s;i&s;ts more with the honour and glory of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> our Lord, for <HI>then</HI> my aim and end is an&s;wered.</P>
<P>If I am a&s;ked in <HI>meekne&s;s</HI> to explain my&s;elf in any particular, wherein it is judged I have not been quite intelligible, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ough I cannot promi&s;e &s;ucce&s;s, I find m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lling to attempt it. But, when <PB N="vii" REF="046269_0006_102115A833DBAE38">any conceited &s;pirit, from meer <HI>wanton|ne&s;s,</HI> maje&s;terially declares me wrong, I &s;hall not reply; becau&s;e <HI>the &s;ervant of the Lord mu&s;t not &s;trive, but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>As I do not remember to have read the author, who hath treated of the &s;ub|ject contained in the following Tract; any farther than to drop &s;ome very brief hints of &s;uch a Truth, which hath been immediately contradicted by &s;ome other po&s;ition: So neither do I remember to have read any thing wrote in con&s;utation thereof, except a few admirable pieces lately handed about; in &s;ome of which, my name &s;tands con&s;picuous as an He|retick. I have rea&s;ons with me very &s;ufficient, why I take no notice of tho&s;e important &s;pirits, &s;o as to an&s;wer them in form.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Re&s;pecting &s;uch that I have &s;een, their performances evidence beyond all controver&s;y, that they did not under&s;tand the matter which they wrote again&s;t, and therefore treated that with contempt which was above them, being not afraid to &s;peak evil of dignities. I would al|ways, <PB N="viii" REF="046269_0007_102115AB475EB030">(unprovoked by their petulancy) an&s;wer tho&s;e with &s;ilence, as being beneath my attention. I would harden my ear again&s;t the roarings of ignorance, and be utterly in&s;en&s;ible of their invectives:</P>
<P>It being ridiculous to fret at the bark|ings of a Cur, when it is the nature of the animal to be noi&s;y. Moreover, my wife, and powerful Antagoni&s;ts, are generally po&s;itive without candour; yea even <HI>in|fallible</HI> in their own conceit: With &s;uch it is unlawful to rea&s;on. To &s;ee what important airs tho&s;e little ma&s;ters give them&s;elves, &s;trikes one at once with laugh|ter and contempt; and con&s;trains the <HI>&s;erious</HI> mind to commi&s;erate the abject &s;tate of Man, which nothing more fully di&s;covers, than the egregious vanity, and in&s;olence, of ab&s;olute determinations with|out rea&s;on. For my part, after having abjured the <HI>Pope</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> I can never &s;ubmit to any infallible chair of an infe|rior Sort: Therefore their po&s;itions have no weight with me, where they produce not their rea&s;ons, and &s;uch rea&s;ons as immediately relate to the matter in hand, and take in its meaning.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="046269_0008_102115AE4EE5EB48">
Until then, they may think as high as they plea&s;e of them&s;elves, (as vain conceit &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to keep up their &s;pirits) I mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity re&s;pect them, &s;o, as to take no notice of their Anathe|mas, but boldly confe&s;s that after the way which they call Here&s;y, &s;o wor&s;hip I the God of my Fathers.</P>
<P>Another rea&s;on, why I do not choo&s;e to an&s;wer (in form) tho&s;e Antagoni&s;ts who have as yet appeared in public again&s;t me, is, that per&s;onal pique, di&s;|appointments, &s;elf-intere&s;t, &amp;c. was not the lea&s;t powerful motive with them in their oppo&s;ition; and where tho&s;e con&s;i|derations influence the mind, it is an ea&s;y matter to find fault, Yea <HI>prejudice</HI> is dex|terous at <HI>making</HI> faults, where there are none. I would not an&s;wer &s;uch as the&s;e, left, by inflaming them, I &s;hould drive them to an utter renunciation of Chri&s;ti|anity: Left they &s;hould ca&s;t off, and re|ject that mea&s;ure of Truth which at pre|&s;ent they <HI>may</HI> have, only becau&s;e, (from per&s;onal enmity) they may be in all things my oppo&s;ites. For, where a &s;pirit of re|&s;entment and &s;elf-&s;eeking takes the lead, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> not &s;trange to &s;ee men change their <PB N="x" REF="046269_0009_102115B27B88EBC8">Maxims, le&s;t they &s;hould be thought to agree in any particular with the objects of their envy; it is a pity the Evidence that &s;ome of my opponents are already too guilty of this Charge, is &s;o full.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, there were many other &s;timu|lating con&s;iderations, well nigh as pow|erful as that of per&s;onal enmity, and revenge, which made them opponents to me, and my doctrine: &s;uch as making their peace with the World, at the expence of the <HI>per&s;ons,</HI> and <HI>matter,</HI> trampled on. They were well aware, of its being a very likely method to gain the favour of man|kind, in the general, e&s;pecially of the pi|ous populace; the light, in which things &s;tand at pre&s;ent, admini&s;tering them a|bundant opportunity for &s;o doing, it be|ing &s;hrewdly fore&s;een, that <HI>prejudice</HI> a|gain&s;t the per&s;on and matter exploded, would not permit the world to inquire impartially, into the merits of the Cau&s;e. They could not but be greatly encouraged, being a&s;&s;ured of victory, before they came to the trial. It might rea&s;onably be ex|pected from hence, that their exclama|tions, and invectives, would have a large run in the world; to the great advantage <PB N="xi" REF="046269_0010_1020EFCD7703FFE8">of the Authors: This Thought had a &s;weet feeling in it. But, I believe, there has been a di&s;appointment here; it &s;hould have been con&s;idered, that the Per&s;on, and Doctrine, which they be&s;patter, are not &s;ufficiently popular, and formidable, to rai&s;e a general Call, for their confutations, and pre&s;ervatives.&mdash;The <HI>deliverance,</HI> is always proportionable to the <HI>Danger,</HI> nor can the <HI>latter</HI> be great, from what is only the object of hatred, and contempt, and not of fear: Had this been con&s;i|dered, their expectations had not been &s;o &s;anguine. I might by appealing to <HI>Human nature,</HI> prove that tho&s;e my rea&s;ons, for not taking any farther notice of my An|tagoni&s;ts, are not mere <HI>&s;urmi&s;e;</HI> which may po&s;&s;ibly be fal&s;e: But I decline this, and declare my&s;elf well a&s;&s;ured of what I have &s;aid, from circum&s;tances &s;ufficient|ly convincing; however, I bid them all farewel in the words of the Poet,
<Q><L>If Want provoke, or Madne&s;s makes them print,</L>
<L>I wage no War with <HI>Bedlam,</HI> nor the <HI>Mint.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>It is not my aim in this Treati&s;e, to defend by external <HI>Argument,</HI> again&s;t gain&s;ayers, what I conceive to be the Truth, as it is in <HI>Je&s;us;</HI> but &s;imply to <PB N="xii" REF="046269_0011_102115B707FF12C8">throw &s;uch a light upon the matter, that <HI>as</HI> it is true, it might appear in a mea|&s;ure intelligible al&s;o. I was for a long &s;ea&s;on, after &s;atisfied of the redemption which is in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>; very unea&s;y at times, concerning the Equity thereof: Indeed the hints which occa&s;ioned tho&s;e di&s;pu|tings in my Mind, were merely acciden|tal; for having received much con&s;ola|tion in the fir&s;t per&s;ua&s;ion of redemption, the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, in the Blood of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> I judged my&s;elf &s;ufficient, (from the Argument I fancied I was Ma&s;ter of, and that re&s;i&s;tle&s;s authority, which I dreamt attended my words when I &s;pake of divine things) for the conviction of the mo&s;t <HI>hardened,</HI> and <HI>aver&s;e</HI> to &s;alvation by <HI>Je&s;us</HI>; and accordingly, as opportu|nity offered, failed not to exert my&s;elf upon this principle: at length I met with one, who (though his zeal, and &s;elf-&s;uffi|ciency, bare no proportion to mine,) was far my &s;uperior in under&s;tanding: after he had with <HI>coolne&s;s</HI> heard what I had to &s;ay, he a&s;ked me wherein was the ju&s;tice, and equity, of one Man's &s;uffering Death, yea even the torments of Hell, for ano|ther: &s;o contrary to rea&s;on and al&s;o to the te&s;timony of &s;cripture, which often <PB N="xiii" REF="046269_0012_102115BBDF452468">declares, that <HI>the Righteous &s;hall not &s;uffer for the Wicked; but that every man's &s;in &s;hould be charged upon his own head,</HI> &amp;c. I was not prepared for &s;uch a que&s;tion as this and was therefore involved in a difficulty, which I could not obviate. I appealed to the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of God, it was granted that God was <HI>Sovereign,</HI> and that from his <HI>Sovereign</HI> plea&s;ure, he created us, re|deemed us, &amp;c. having nothing to move him to it, but his own will: yet he wills nothing but what is ju&s;t, and equitable, becau&s;e he is ju&s;t when he judgeth, and ju&s;tifieth. I would then have urged, that as God is infinitely above us; his tho'ts, and ways above ours; we are not to con|ceive of <HI>him,</HI> his <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Equity,</HI> ac|cording to our low, and &s;canty notions thereof. It was an&s;wered, if I granted that mankind had any true notion of Ju&s;tice, and Equity, though but in the &s;malle&s;t degree, then what is contrary to <HI>this,</HI> mu&s;t be much <HI>more &s;o</HI> to God, who&s;e Ju&s;tice and Truth, is infinite, pure, and eternal. I urged other matters, to as little purpo&s;e, and though I con&s;idently continued in my former a&s;&s;ertion, yet I was forced to abate much of my &s;elf|importance, and very often afterwards, <PB N="xiv" REF="046269_0013_102115BD655E40F0">was greatly di&s;turbed in my mind, on account of the&s;e things. As far as my capacity would admit, I applied my&s;elf to reading; and read a great many Books, treating of redemption by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>; and found them all run in one Channel, <HI>viz.</HI> that Man being a debtor, and tran&s;|gre&s;&s;or, and unable to &s;ave him&s;elf, <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> became his &s;urety, under an engage|ment to pay his Debts, and to bear his puni&s;hment: The <HI>Equity</HI> of which, is generally re&s;olved into the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of God, or accounted for, from the willing|ne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> (as an <HI>independent Divine Per&s;on</HI>) to &s;uffer, in the &s;inners &s;tead: whil&s;t others &s;atisfy them&s;elves, with the bare po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertion, that it is equita|ble, for one per&s;on to be &s;urety for ano|ther, not only in ca&s;e of Debt; but even in capital offences. Tho&s;e re&s;olutions, I read, over, and over, but rather more <HI>perplexed</HI> than <HI>&s;atisfied</HI> thereby. In vain it was, that the mo&s;t pious and orthodox writers, and preachers, explained the matter thus; I was <HI>constrained</HI> to de&s;pi&s;e all human authority, in things of this nature; e&s;pecially where there was not the <HI>&s;hadow</HI> of Rea&s;on and Fquity. I applied my&s;elf more carefully, to the <PB N="xv" REF="046269_0014_102115C0A8FDCE10">reading and &s;tudy of the Scriptures; as without notes, or expo&s;itions: &s;ubmitting in &s;pirit, unto Him, who at fir&s;t dictated, and hath taken it upon him to make us under&s;tand them. And thence it was, I di&s;cerned according to that &s;canty mea|&s;ure I have attained, what I conceive to be the harmony of divine Truth, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Union</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and, how clear the equity of redemption by the blood of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> appears in this Truth, in the following Treati&s;e I have attempted to thew. And, becau&s;e I have thereby found a retreat in <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> from the face of the Enemy, and all his dangerous in&s;inuations, whereby he would have &s;haken the foundations, I publi&s;h it to others, that if there &s;hould be among&s;t my readers, <HI>&s;uch</HI> who are tried with trials of like nature, they may po&s;&s;ibly have in&s;truction &s;ealed, to their peace, and con&s;olation. It is al&s;o probable, that &s;uch may read, whom either preju|dice or lack of opportunity, will not permit to hear.&mdash;There are generally but few, among&s;t the great multitude, who inquire into the merits of the cau&s;e they engage in: Tradition, received from their Fathers, zeal and affection for <PB N="xvi" REF="046269_0015_102115C28C63EBB8">their Leaders, &s;pirit them on to per&s;ua|&s;ion beyond &s;cruple, that they are in the Truth. It is very probable, there are others, who &s;imply crediting the &s;cripture te&s;timony, that <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> died for our &s;ins, and ro&s;e again for our Ju&s;tification, are happy in that Truth; without once inquiring into the equity thereof, or ever thinking it nece&s;&s;ary &s;o to do. The re|ality of their peace, I will not pretend to deny, as they believe the Facts, which the go&s;pel relates, and propo&s;es as the Joy and Peace of Mankind. But yet, the nece&s;&s;ity of examining the equity thereof, remains; as is evident, fir&s;t from the &s;criptures treating &s;o plentifully of it: To deny the nece&s;&s;ity of attending to which teaching, would be the highe&s;t arrogance. Again, though they may hitherto have e&s;caped the temptation <HI>within,</HI> and the argument of &s;uch <HI>with|out,</HI> who walk enemies to the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t; yet it proves not, that they &s;hall <HI>always</HI> e&s;cape: therefore it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary, they &s;hould, from the faithful apprehen&s;ion of their <HI>union</HI> with <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> be &s;o rooted, and grounded in Love, that their Joy may abide, and no man take it from them. Again, it is nece&s;&s;ary, that <PB N="xvii" REF="046269_0016_102115C72E2EB548">knowing God, they may glorify him <HI>as God,</HI> who, being infinitely glorious, and exalted, in all the perfections of his Na|ture, hath in this gracious plan, mo&s;t wonderfully exhibited that Divine har|mony, which to <HI>man,</HI> is &s;o rich a proof of his unity.</P>
<P>As to my talking &s;o much of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> his per&s;on, and excellencies, my continu|al endeavour to point <HI>him</HI> out, as <HI>the Way, the Truth, and the Life</HI>; I hope, even &s;uch who would be thought the <HI>guardians</HI> of true godline&s;s, will bear with me a lit|tle, when I give them my rea&s;ons for &s;o doing. Fir&s;t, I am under very great obligations to Him, which coming to light every Day, more and more, con|&s;trains me to &s;peak of him, and to e&s;teem Him very precious. Again, I may be excu&s;ed a little, becau&s;e te&s;timonies of this nature, are very rare: whil&s;t <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es,</HI> hath them who preach <HI>Him,</HI> every &s;abbath day, in every &s;ynagogue. And whil&s;t mo&s;t of the publications on Divinity, are now entitled <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>; as the Dady Ad|verti&s;ements bear witne&s;s, (than which, there is <HI>nothing</HI> according to my appre|hen&s;ion more fully proves the decline of <PB N="xviii" REF="046269_0017_102115CBEAE4AAC8">real Chri&s;tianity. I hope &s;o in&s;igni&s;icant a per&s;on as I, may be indulged with &s;ay|ing &s;omewhat of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The phra&s;e <HI>Practical,</HI> when applied to Divinity, &s;eems to be made u&s;e of, in direct oppo&s;ition to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>; and that, which <HI>immediately</HI> treats of him: as though <HI>he</HI> was dry Theory, a Fable, or an idle &s;peculation only. Will it be an&s;wered, that the wickedne&s;s of the age is <HI>&s;uch,</HI> as renders it needful to write, and preach, <HI>practically</HI> as called? Is not this giving up the cau&s;e to the enemy, and a tacit acknowledgment, that the Article <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is in&s;ufficient? Yea, that this Article rather tends to corrupt mankind, and promote bad morals; or indeed to &s;ay thus: fain would we reform the world, we have u&s;ed all means to do them good, we have tried <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> we have preached, and wrote of <HI>him,</HI> but <HI>he</HI> would not do: He only made all things wor&s;e, how can <HI>he</HI> be of God, who&s;e Di&s;ciples break the Sabbath Day? &amp;c. we are therefore ob|liged to lay <HI>him</HI> a&s;ide, and betake our|&s;elves to the Law of <HI>Me&s;es,</HI> with other good rules, which pious Men have plan|ed; and by in&s;i&s;ting upon their living up to tho&s;e (promi&s;ing <HI>&s;alvation</HI> unto &s;uch who <HI>do</HI>; and threatning all that do <HI>not,</HI> <PB N="xix" REF="046269_0018_102115CD71C2AD90">with <HI>Eternal Damnation)</HI> we hope to &s;tem the torrent of vice, and turn mankind into the paths of virtue and piety.</P>
<P>Have your inventions an&s;wered the End intended; are they more reformed than they were in the days of the Apo&s;tles, who made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to preach a cruci|fied <HI>Je&s;us</HI>? where is the Church, or So|ciety of Chri&s;tians <HI>now,</HI> who attain to this Character, <HI>The multitude of them that believed, were of one heart, and of one &s;oul, neither &s;aid any of them, that ought of the things which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed was his own, but they had all things common?</HI> Acts iv. 32. This was effected by the &s;imple te&s;timo|ny of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> his death, and re&s;urrection; the people were <HI>then</HI> taught, that they were the body of <HI>Chri&s;t in particular, and members one of another.</HI> Whereas, the more modern doctrines have taught man|kind to re&s;pect each other as <HI>Aliens,</HI> each e&s;teeming of him&s;elf, better than ano|ther; imagining he has property di&s;tinct from his brother, yea even in &s;pirituals; he looks on his <HI>own</HI> things, and not on the things of <HI>another.</HI> Thus the modern doctrines, and traditions of men, are calculated to promote &s;elf-love, &s;piritual <PB N="xx" REF="046269_0019_102116DFE1945040">pride, bigotry, and hatred of each other, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tead of love. Therefore is it, that the morals of mankind are as bad as ever, not with&s;tanding the nece&s;&s;ity and benefit of holine&s;s, and good works, is daily &s;ounded in their ears. And even among&s;t the <HI>reformed,</HI> as they would be thought, is there not envying, &s;trife, contention, backbiting, evil-&s;peaking, whi&s;pering, uncharitablene&s;s, the putting forth of the finger, revenge, inhumanity with every evil work and di&s;po&s;ition? and indeed this is the genuine fruit of the doctrines of the age; for where people are taught to di&s;tingui&s;h between &s;aints and &s;inners, and to think them&s;elves holier than their neighbours, it is not &s;trange that they u&s;e them ill. As this is &s;o general, I &s;uppo&s;e it will not greatly irritate, that a few worth|le&s;s men, without character, or popularity, &s;hould make Chri&s;t their &s;ubject, and be ever <HI>preaching</HI> or <HI>writing</HI> of him. It is to be feared, that being meerly orthodox, in point of works, with a de&s;ire at times of <HI>doing,</HI> and at other times, a &s;igh &amp; &s;orrow for <HI>not</HI> doing, with a zeal for propagating the doctrine, is that which <HI>&s;ooths</HI> and <HI>keeps</HI> in peace the con&s;ciences of many, who otherwi&s;e are very &s;en&s;ible of their <PB N="xxi" REF="046269_0020_1020EFE0419CC7E0">deficiency in this particular: And to talk of <HI>practice,</HI> and knowing nothing more of it; yea in &s;hort, to talk of it, without keeping the <HI>whole Law,</HI> is &s;uch a decepti|on where &s;cripture authority is admitted, yea or even what rea&s;on &s;ugge&s;ts of the nature of the divine Being,) as cannot be accounted for, but by the pride, bewitch|ery and madne&s;s which we are naturally involved in. Per&s;ons in this ca&s;t, plea&s;e them&s;elves, like the kings of <HI>Bedlam,</HI> who imagine their rags a purple robe, and their heap of &s;traw a throne; and are very an|gry with all who will not humour their vain conceit.</P>
<P>As to the zealous promoters of the doctrine of works, in oppo&s;ition to the complete &s;alvation of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> our Lord, we know what <HI>he</HI> &s;ays of them: That they lay heavy burdens upon mens &s;houlders, which they <HI>them&s;elves</HI> will not touch with one of their fingers: and the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, neither they <HI>them&s;elves</HI> keep the Law, but de&s;ire to have <HI>you</HI> circum|cifed that they may glory in <HI>your</HI> fle&s;h.

<P>Nothing is more probable than that it will be objected, I am an enemy to good works, or, that convinced by the holy practice of &s;ome particulars among&s;t the Profe&s;&s;ors of Religion, I pine with envy; affecting to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> what I cannot <HI>attain</HI> unto.

<P>I <HI>am</HI> not, cannot, po&s;&s;ibly be an enemy to <HI>Good</HI> works; but then, I mu&s;t have &s;ome more inconte&s;table proof of good|ne&s;s, before I become an admirer, than ignorant <HI>roarings,</HI> the clamours and im|portant airs of vain pretenders.

<P>THE doctrine of <HI>Union</HI> between <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his <HI>Church</HI> renders the Sy&s;tem of man's redemption by his Blood, beautifully con&s;i&s;tent, and worthy its glorious Author.</P>

</LIST></P>
<P>The <HI>Union</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and his <HI>Church,</HI> appears to me a Truth of &s;uch impor|tance, that I can &s;ee no con&s;i&s;tency in the Doctrine of Salvation by <HI>Je&s;us</HI> without it.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The method of grace and &s;alvation accor|ding to Union: is not at all contradictory to the &s;overeignty of God: That being &s;ufficient|ly manife&s;t, where he hath decreed the honour, and glory of his Son, as the principal and lead|ing maxim in all his divine appointments. <HI>He was before all things, and by Him all things con&s;i&s;t.</HI> The creation of Man, and his being appointed to obtain &s;alvation, by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> is a farther proof of divine &s;overeignty; nothing moving the Almighty thereunto, but his own will: Yet this hinders not the <HI>Method</HI> and <HI>Execution</HI> of this Grace, its being according to equity, and <HI>that &s;uch</HI> as We, by <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Revelation</HI> may properly conceive of. But when &s;ove|reignty is introduced from fir&s;t, to la&s;t; to the utter exclu&s;ion of equity, which is often done; (as a palliative for man's ignorance in divine things) the con&s;equences attending are dan|gerous. Fir&s;t, as it depreciates the &s;acri&s;ice of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and makes his Death unnece&s;&s;ary: &s;ince <HI>Ab&s;olutene&s;s</HI> might have remitted the offence without &s;hedding of blood. Or if it is hinted, that this Condition <HI>took place</HI> and was <HI>accepted</HI> from meer &s;overeign plea&s;ure only: Then, of con&s;equence it was not proportionable, as an attonement unto the offence; and its Dignity as the Blood of God denied: Nor (upon &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition) was it nece&s;&s;ary that our Saviour &s;hould be more than man. But, if the &s;crip|tures dignify the Blood of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> in &s;aying, that God purcha&s;ed the Church <HI>with his own Blood</HI>; if <HI>he</HI> was made a cur&s;e for us: if <HI>his</HI> &s;ufferings as the puni&s;hment of &s;in was equal to the of|fence; then was it accepted, not from <HI>meer ab|&s;olutene&s;s,</HI> but from the harmony and full con&s;ent of Mercy and Truth, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Peace. Again, &s;uch an u&s;e made of Divine Sovereignty, would be to reject the te&s;timony of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the Prophets; where they declare that God will not hold the &s;inner guiltle&s;s, nor acquit him without the &s;hedding of Blood, even the Blood of the offender. To throw a light upon which, and to in&s;truct the people in the my&s;tery there|of, they were taught from the Union &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them&s;elves, and their &s;acrifices, to re&s;|pect the Blood, and death, of their &s;acrifice, as their own: and as &s;uch, was the Blood taken by the High prie&s;t into the holy pre&s;ence; where the names of the people ingraven on the &s;tones o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> memorial, were pre&s;ent with the blood; confe&s;&s;ing it, and claiming the benefits re&s;ulting from the &s;hedding thereof, as a pun|i&s;hment adequate to their &s;in. Which ble&s;&s;ings were remi&s;&s;ion and ju&s;tification to Life. Thus through all the di&s;pen&s;ations committed to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> the &s;ymbols of equity are in&s;eperably connected with the Figures of Salvation by <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> From all which it appears, That God's &s;ove|reign Grace, and Will to &s;ave mankind, hath been executed according to &s;tricte&s;t Truth and Equity: and &s;uch is the Wi&s;dom, that God is un&s;peakably glorious in the Honor, and Glory his <HI>Son</HI> hath obtained thereby; and mankind infinitely advantaged. Should it be objected, that the Apo&s;tle him&s;elf re&s;olves certain que|ries in the &s;overeignty of God; &s;aying, <HI>who art thou that replie&s;t again&s;t God? &s;hall the thing formed, &s;ay unto him who forme. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, why ha&s;t thou made me thus?</HI> &amp;c.

Be&s;ides, I know not of any human Laws, which admit of &s;urety&s;hip in <HI>capital</HI> Offences; and Sin is not only a <HI>Debt,</HI> for which &s;urety&s;hip is &s;ometimes admitted, but a <HI>Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion,</HI> a <HI>Crime,</HI> capital in the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e, only attoned for by the &s;hedding of Blood; by the <HI>Death,</HI> yea, by the <HI>eternal Death</HI> of the Sinner: which Ju&s;tice mu&s;t inflict, before it can be properly &s;atisfied; nor can it po&s;&s;ibly admit of a Surety here: becau&s;e, it can only puni&s;h Him, whom it <HI>fir&s;t</HI> finds guilty; and that not by rec|koning him to <HI>be</HI> what he is <HI>not,</HI> ac|cording to human quibbles; but accord|ing to artle&s;s, rea&s;onable, divine Equity; <PB N="9" REF="046269_0042_1021161063028258">which can only declare &s;uch guilty, on whom the fault is found, and can only find the fault on &s;uch who have commit|ted it; <HI>We</HI> only committed the fault, upon <HI>Us</HI> only can it be found: There|fore, without &s;uch an <HI>Union</HI> between <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and <HI>us,</HI> as expo&s;es <HI>us</HI> in <HI>his</HI> per&s;on, to Judgment and Condemnation; the harmony of the divine perfections, doth not appear in the things which he &s;uffer|ed, becau&s;e contrary to Truth and Ju&s;tice.</P>

For, where is the wi&s;dom of imputing Sin to Chri&s;t, which he had no right to bear? and whence his right, if not from Union to the &s;in|ner? but grant <HI>this,</HI> Then indeed the great Deep breaks open, and Wi&s;dom, infinite Wi&s;dom appears: whil&s;t each beholder, with wonder cries, O! the <PB N="11" REF="046269_0044_102116180F815470">Depth! who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been His Coun|&s;ellor?</P>
<P>It is al&s;o contrary to <HI>Love:</HI> the &s;crip|tures are very explicit, in declaring the Father's Love to the Son; but the pu|ni&s;hment of this Son, for crimes he &s;tood in no relation to, implies a defect in Love: yea, rather a greater Love to <HI>Man,</HI> the offender, than to his well-beloved <HI>Son,</HI> who was the <HI>Brightne&s;s of his glory, and the expre&s;s Image of his per&s;on:</HI> and is withal a manife&s;t contradiction to the divine Te&s;tmony, which a&s;&s;erts the pre|eminence of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> in all things. Withal, to love the impure, is incon&s;i&s;tent with the morality of the divine nature; there|fore, where the Father giving his &s;on, is at any time mentioned as an evidence of his Love to mankind, it is a proof of his &s;uperlative Love unto Him,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>God &s;o loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son,</HI> &amp;c.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. ii. 23, 24.</NOTE>: where <HI>Adam,</HI> on the fir&s;t &s;ight of his <HI>Eve,</HI> declares the <HI>Union</HI> &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting between them. It is evident from his words, that this relation did not con|&s;i&s;t in that matrimonial connection, which commenced, when by mutual con&s;ent, and covenant, they cohabited and po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed each other: But was dependant on &s;omething prior to this. The &s;ource of their <HI>Union,</HI> and kindred relation, was their being <HI>one</HI> in the Love of the Father; where they were undi&s;tingui&s;hed in &s;ex, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> there being neither Male nor Fe|male, in <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> in whom they were loved, and cho&s;en, before the world be|gan. And yet the man was not without the woman, nor the woman without the man in the Lord: This &s;ource, had its fir&s;t opening in their concreation, in one Body, and Human intelligence: which Body, and intelligence, was Male; though not without including the Female: But the Latter, according to the di&s;tinction of Sex and per&s;onal exi&s;tence, was, as being in the Male in a &s;tate of pa&s;&s;ivity, and the Male, the active con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the twain in one. <HI>Adam</HI> con&s;idering his <PB N="58" REF="046269_0091_102116A670370098">perfection in knowledge, could not be ignorant of this, his true &s;tate; and there|fore expecting the Woman, to be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed in per&s;on and &s;ex, as a manife&s;ta|tion to his &s;en&s;es, of the truth of her Be|ing, and <HI>Union</HI> unto him; he knew her when the Lord God brought her unto him: And though there was a deep &s;leep upon him, when &s;he was built from his &s;ide, yet when he &s;aw her, he &s;aid, <HI>&s;he was fle&s;h of his fle&s;h and bone of his bone;</HI> alluding unto the <HI>former</HI> truth, and not unto any thing which was to follow. For they were not made more one fle&s;h, by that mutual, matrimonial embrace which followed, than they were before: The latter, as a fruit or con&s;equence, being only declara|tive of the original truth, always apparent to God, and in it&s;elf, with him, perfect, and permanent.</P>
<P>Thus the matrimonial bond of <HI>Union,</HI> was with them a <HI>con&s;equence,</HI> and <HI>fruit</HI> of an antecedent <HI>Union</HI> and kindred. This al&s;o is more manife&s;t, where <HI>Abraham,</HI> when he was old, cau&s;ed his &s;ervant to &s;wear by the Lord God of heaven and earth, that he would not take a wife to his Son of the Daughters of the Land: <PB N="59" REF="046269_0092_102116A82E6B54D0">But that he would take him a wife of his kindred: Such al&s;o was <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s injunc|tion to <HI>Jacob.</HI> In this particular al&s;o, <HI>E&s;au</HI> offended; by marrying the daugh|ters of <HI>Heth,</HI> where there was no <HI>Union</HI> or kindred previous to the Marriage. From all which, it appears that <HI>Adam</HI>'s &s;peech to <HI>Eve,</HI> was grounded upon that kindred <HI>Union</HI> which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them be|fore their Marriage.</P>
<P>When the Apo&s;tle had &s;aid, that a Man and his Wife &s;hould be one fle&s;h; he immediately adds, <HI>This is a great My&s;tery, but I &s;peak concerning Chri&s;t and his Church.</HI> From whence we may ob&s;erve, that the <HI>Union</HI> of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> of which I have already &s;poken, was truly a figure of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his <HI>Church:</HI> And again, that this figure, though clo&s;e and pertinent, is but a figure; an imperfect repre&s;enta|tion of the matter, which made the Apo&s;|tle turn from the fle&s;hly marriage, and &s;ay it is a great my&s;tery; and pointing to the Union of Chri&s;t and the People, as the grand truth or thing &s;ignified, &s;ay, <HI>but I &s;peak concerning Chri&s;t and the Church.</HI> The Union and kindred relation of Adam and Eve, and of the Patriarchs and <PB N="60" REF="046269_0093_102116ACB05E6688">their Wives, previous to their marriage (the latter being &s;ub&s;equent to the for|mer, and a po&s;itive proof thereof). ac|cording to the primitive Law: The earthly things being a pattern of the hea|venly, repre&s;ents the <HI>onene&s;s of Chri&s;t</HI> and the <HI>Church.</HI> Their marriage as a figure, &s;hews our believing or clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t by Faith: And that <HI>Union</HI> and kindred, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them before Marriage, was a &s;hadow of the <HI>Union</HI> between Chri&s;t and his Church, before the Church is brought to the knowledge of her Hu&s;band; by believing, or ere they are married unto him who is ri&s;en from the dead: But, as marriage is the con&s;ummate end of <HI>Union,</HI> it is to be con&s;idered as explanatory of the ble&s;|&s;ings contained therein; it &s;hews the <HI>Woman</HI> under her <HI>Hu&s;band's</HI> name, in a joint po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and enjoyment with him, of his &s;tate and condition.

If this idea of marriage is true, it is ea&s;ily perceived that it is only true in Chri&s;t. Previous to our marriage by Faith with him who is ri&s;en from the dead, there is a di&s;covery made of his per&s;on, of his being our kin&s;man redeemer, of his right to demand us: hence it ap|pears wrong to refu&s;e him, nor are we under the <HI>compul&s;ion</HI> of that divine right which he hath to us, only; but he al&s;o &s;hews us his glory, his per&s;onal beauties, his &s;uitablene&s;s to our wants, and this he doth, until our <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> is convinced, our objections &s;ilenced, and the full con&s;ent of all our powers gained, to be his; to bear his name, to commit our&s;elves fully to him, with all our concerns; until we cea&s;e from care, contented and rejoiced that he &s;hould cloath us, feed us, in&s;truct us, protect, nouri&s;h, guide and pre&s;erve us unto everla&s;ting life.

<P><HI>Union</HI> between <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and the <HI>Church,</HI> is a matter univer&s;ally acknowledged; where that deference, which is ju&s;tly due <PB N="65" REF="046269_0098_102116B9ED2D8D40">to the &s;criptures, is paid; though, it is a &s;ubject very rarely treated of: Which &s;i|lence concerning it, implies, either a ge|neral ignorance of the nature thereof, or, that it is re&s;pected as a matter, neither conducive to the glory of God; nor the happine&s;s of mankind; and therefore not nece&s;&s;ary to be taught. And where the nature thereof is in &s;ome mea&s;ure known among&s;t men, and the utility of the doc|trine allowed, they are much divided about its antiquity; before our believ|ing, or Faith in Chri&s;t, &s;ay &s;ome: Whil&s;t others with as much &s;trenuou&s;ne&s;s a&s;&s;ert the contrary.

I would now con&s;ider the objections ge|nerally made unto the Grace of <HI>Union</HI>; and endeavour to give them &s;atisfactory an&s;wers.</P>
<P>The old trite objection, of its tending unto Licentiou&s;ne&s;s, leads the way, &s;aying if <HI>Union</HI> with <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is the ground of our acceptance with God, and our &s;ecurity in his favour; then the doctrine of re|wards and puni&s;hments, is overthrown; and man hath nothing left to &s;timulate him to virtue.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> To work from an expectation of being rewarded, is to make it of Debt; and not of Grace: But the nature of the Deity is &s;o infinitely pure; &s;o holy, ju&s;t, and true his Laws; that it is impo&s;&s;ible Man &s;hould make him his Debtor: Nay it would be the highe&s;t arrogance to pre|tend it: The <HI>&s;crip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es</HI> are again&s;t it when they prote&s;t that no fle&s;h &s;hall glo|ry in his pre&s;ence; common <HI>experience</HI> in its &s;ober moments is again&s;t it: For that teacheth us, that every man living, is infi|nitely &s;hort of conformity unto the di|vine nature; therefore the notion of obe|dience from an expectation of reward, is <PB N="78" REF="046269_0111_102116E37754CF68">a tacit acknowledgment of Man's utter ignorance, both of him&s;elf, and his God.

The Go&s;pel is preached for the obedience of Faith; that, being thereby delivered from fear, we might &s;erve him in holi|ne&s;s, and righteou&s;ne&s;s, all the days of our life.</P>
<P>But the obedience of fear, is diametri|cally oppo&s;ite unto the obedience of faith: The former, hath its ri&s;e and mainte|nance from a <HI>Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>: From that habit, and principle, which makes God a <HI>Liar;</HI> by not believing the record which he hath given of his Son.

And as this is needful to be known, &s;o is it al&s;o, that we &s;hould be able to di&s;tin|gui&s;h one from the other; el&s;e how doth it appear that we rightly divide the word of life? If the Go&s;pel be con&s;ider|ed, as God's good &s;ayings, or glad Ty|dings to mankind, we need only con&s;ider briefly the &s;tate and condition of Man; and then, what may with any propriety, be called glad Tydings, unto one thus cir|cum&s;tanced, will ea&s;ily appear. Man is a fallen creature, who breaking the Law of his God, incurred the penalty of eter|nal death: And, is &s;o far from having ability to extricate him&s;elf, that all the imaginations, and thoughts of his heart, are continually evil; without wi&s;dom, without &s;trength, there being none righ|teous, no, not one; all being &s;hut up, and concluded under &s;in, they have neither power to <HI>will,</HI> nor to <HI>do</HI>; Now, what can be called glad Tydings unto a Creature in this condition? &s;urely nothing &s;hort of <PB N="82" REF="046269_0115_102116F1FAFB55B0">that which tells him all is given: And that freely, without condition on <HI>his</HI> part becau&s;e he can perform none; without <HI>Money,</HI> and without <HI>Price,</HI> becau&s;e he hath nought wherewith to purcha&s;e; and that the Grace, which redie&s;&s;eth all his griev|ances, and replemshed him with all good, is given him in <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> who hath brought this life, and immortality to light by the Go&s;pel; by his Birth, Life, Suf|ferings, Death, and Re&s;urrection; con|firming all <HI>his</HI> ble&s;&s;ing, and Glory, unto his <HI>Church,</HI> by the Grace of <HI>Union:</HI> This appears to be the go&s;pel of glad Tydings, and is a Doctrine with which the &s;crip|tures abound.</P>
<P>The Law, is con&s;idered as the very op|po&s;ite of <HI>this;</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of commands, to fulfil its precepts on pain of damnation, of threatnings, and cur&s;es, again&s;t all who offend it, tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in one point; and never makes any promi&s;es of happine&s;s unto mankind, but upon condition of perfect obedience; which is always implied, (tho' not expre&s;&s;ed) in every requi&s;ite, yea even the mo&s;t minute, intithing to the inheritance of the promi&s;e. The Doctrine of rewards and puni&s;hments, is <PB N="83" REF="046269_0116_102116F3C78C1930">indeed contained in the Law; but then, it rewards none but &s;uch who fulfil every jot, and tittle thereof: And cur&s;eth every one, who continueth not to do <HI>all</HI> that is written in the Book thereof.</P>
<P>The <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> gives us all, without requir|ing ought of us. But the <HI>Law,</HI> giving us nothing, requires all of us. And thus di&s;|tingui&s;hing them in the &s;criptures, we ap|peal from the <HI>Law,</HI> unto the <HI>Go&s;pel:</HI> Our Authority for &s;o doing, is founded on what follows; what&s;oever the Law &s;aith, it &s;aith unto them that are under it: But <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was made of a woman, made under the Law, therefore the Law &s;peaks unto <HI>him;</HI> and commands <HI>him</HI> to perfect obedience. But, the Law can only cur&s;e the &s;inner: God &s;ent <HI>his Son in the like|ne&s;s of &s;inful fle&s;h, he was made &s;in for us, Chri&s;t hath delivered us from the Cur&s;e of the law, being made a cur&s;e for us:</HI> The equity of which proceeding, appears from the <HI>Union</HI> &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and the <HI>Church</HI>; of which I have &s;ufficiently &s;poken.

This is that which rai&s;es us when fallen, which bring us back when we have wandered, and affords &s;trong Con&s;olation, unto all who have fled unto <HI>Je&s;us</HI> for refuge; hence if any man &s;in, we have an Advocate with the Father, <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> the righteous, &amp;c. whil&s;t <HI>he</HI> wears the Character of righteous, <HI>we</HI> &s;hall be accepted of God, and Glorious in his &s;ight: And that is everla&s;tingly, for <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is the <HI>&s;ame Ye&s;terday, To-day and for ever.</HI> The Go&s;pel is here a relation of facts, of who <HI>Je&s;us</HI> is, what he hath <HI>done,</HI> and that he hath loved us, hath <HI>&s;aved</HI> us; hath wa&s;hed, forgiven and ac|cepted us; the divine beauty, and rea&s;on|ablene&s;s of which, appears in the Grace of <HI>union.</HI> This Grace doth not require us, &s;ophi&s;tically and unnaturally, to make that a truth by believing; which was not a truth before; but fir&s;t propo&s;es <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> as the truth, the grand original truth, be|fore all things, and by whom all things con&s;i&s;t.

That he is the truth of all the types, predictions, and prophecies of the Jews, the truth of wi&s;|dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, holine&s;s, redemption and &s;alvation unto the Gentiles, is what the Go&s;pel declares; affirming, illu&s;trat|ing, arguing, per&s;uacing, until the arm of the Lord is revealed, and the report believed.

The &s;atisfaction which he had in you at fir&s;t, was behold|ing you as the travail of his &s;oul, and as &s;uch, he beholds you &s;till. Your unbe|lief cannot make his grace of none effect, and though you have denied him, yet he cannot deny him&s;elf. That which was a truth before you believed, at the fir&s;t, <HI>viz.

It is the &s;cripture te&s;timony of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> what <HI>he</HI> is, and what <HI>he</HI> hath done, and &s;uffered, that is the ground of our confidence; and not the reflection that <HI>we</HI> repent, believe, or obey; and it is mo&s;t cer|tain that this ground remaineth, that this foundation is un&s;haken, for <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is <HI>the &s;ame Ye&s;terday, To-day, and for ever</HI>; and that <HI>our</HI> unbelief, or any change pa&s;|&s;ing <PB N="123" REF="046269_0156_10211767F626B778">over <HI>us,</HI> as in our&s;elves, cannot alter him who is unchangeable, and always Righteous and accepted. In him we are always as He is, according to which &s;imi|litude God always beholds us, and accepts us; therefore, our change of frame or di&s;po&s;ition, cannot change His views of us; for, as he only beholds us in <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> He can always &s;ay that <HI>he beholds no ini|quity in</HI> Jacob, <HI>nor perver&s;ene&s;s in</HI> I&s;rael. <HI>The Lord his God is</HI> always <HI>with him, and the &s;hout of a King is among them.</HI> O! glorious Grace! O triumphant Love! let him who is fallen from hence, &s;ay, rejoice not again&s;t me, O mine enemy, for though I fall, I &s;hall yet ari&s;e. Doth not this te&s;timony quicken unto faith, and confidence in <HI>Je&s;us!</HI> Doth it not obviate and &s;ilence <HI>all</HI> the complaints and objec|tions of the broken and de&s;pairing Spirit, and bring back to the Saviour, that which was driven away? &s;urely it does. Thus from the Grace of <HI>Union,</HI> which renders <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;uch an High Prie&s;t as becometh us, we obtain favour, and find Grace to help us in every time of need. Salvation and Perfection in <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> our Lord, by <HI>Union</HI> with Him, is that glo|rious Truth, which fir&s;t authorizes, en|courages <PB N="124" REF="046269_0157_1021176B364979E8">and influences to believe: and that which pre&s;erves us &s;potle&s;s and ac|ceptable unto God, when we fail to be|lieve and credit his te&s;timony; and infi|nitely above all other con&s;iderations, hath a tendency to rai&s;e us in our hope and confidence towards God; and to pre&s;erve us from de&s;peration. It is therefore un|ju&s;t and unnatural, to charge this Doctrine with having a tendency to indulge people in unbelief. Con&s;idering the condition of Man, and the te&s;timony of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> I would challenge all the ma&s;ters of I&s;rael, to produce a &s;y&s;tem more powerfully tending to reconcile Man unto God, and to rai&s;e the doubtful Soul unto confidence in Him: let all &s;uch who (through the experience of human weakne&s;s, or the power of temptation, are fallen from the faith of the Son of God, and &s;unk to the Hell of their &s;en&s;es, con&s;ider this matter, and renew their &s;trength as Eagles.</P>
<P>Furthermore, from the grace of <HI>Union,</HI> we are taught to con&s;ider <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> as the hero of the &s;cripture. All the members bring their tribute unto him, as the ex|alted head. If what I have already aimed at proving, is true; that primarily as the <PB N="125" REF="046269_0158_1021176E8160D438">head of his body the church, all the pro|mi&s;es were made unto him, all the threat|enings fall upon him, &amp;c. then by him we inherit, by him we have atoned; we claim no good out of him, nor will we acknowledge the evil, for as much as in him we have been purged. All the beau|teous characters in the &s;cripture are his, and are only <HI>typical</HI> in the per&s;ons unto whom they are given in the letter; which is a|bundantly evident, from the contra&s;t ap|pearing in every one of them; they be|ing all guilty of vices, diametrically op|po&s;ite to the virtues for which they are famous; Righteous <HI>Noah</HI> and <HI>Lot,</HI> both charged with Drunkenne&s;s, and one with horrid ince&s;t. Faithful <HI>Abraham</HI> with ci&s;tru&s;t, meanne&s;s of &s;pirit, lying or equi|vocating, as in the ca&s;e of <HI>Saran.</HI> Meek <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> with unwarrantable pa&s;&s;ion, unad|vi&s;ed &s;peech, and &s;uch &s;wellings at the waters of &s;trife as barred his entrance in|to the promi&s;ed land. It charges holy. <HI>David,</HI> the man after God's own heart, with &s;uch weakne&s;&s;es and crimes, as are by no means con&s;i&s;tent with holine&s;s; but were a glaring proof of his heart being very unlike the heart of God. And <HI>Solo|mon</HI> &s;o famous for wi&s;dom, had his dark|&s;ide: <PB N="126" REF="046269_0159_10211771ED7BA570">how great were his follies! And whil&s;t much might be &s;aid for his wi&s;dom, how many in&s;tances might be given of the mo&s;t &s;tupid and God provoking fool|i&s;hne&s;s in him. <HI>Job</HI> al&s;o, admired for his patience, gave the mo&s;t pregnant proofs of impatience and peevi&s;hne&s;s. It will be natural to inquire from hence, why the &s;criptures which gives tho&s;e men the mo&s;t beautiful and amiable characters, as righteous, faithful, meek, holy, wi&s;e and patient, &s;hould at the &s;ame time, pre&s;ent us with a contra&s;t in each of them, drawn in &s;uch &s;trong colours, that the mo&s;t pal|pable contradiction appears? The an&s;wer is ea&s;y, Let God be true and every man a liar. Tho&s;e men were all types of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> their characters figurative of his. there|fore divine wi&s;dom thought proper, not only to &s;tain their glory, by &s;uffering &s;uch blemi&s;hes in their &s;pirit and conduct, as gave the lie unto their virtues, but al&s;o to record the &s;ame; that at be&s;t they might appear but meer &s;hadows, re&s;erving the &s;ub&s;tance for <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> Therefore, who&s;o reading the characters of tho&s;e men, are not taught to look beyond them, unto the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> have yet read the &s;criptures to little purpo&s;e; having not yet known <PB N="127" REF="046269_0160_102117750EC5C0E8">them, nor the power of God. Neither the Prophets nor Apo&s;tles wrote with the view that &s;uch who venerate their <HI>wri|tings</HI> &s;hould have their <HI>per&s;ons</HI> in admi|ration; neither theirs, who&s;e character they drew, as eminent and famous, in the Church of God. But the &s;pirit which mov|ed them, de&s;igned through the whole, the honour and glory of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>: that pa&s;&s;|ing on from every man, we might attain to the admiration of the per&s;on and excel|lencies of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> as the only Righteous, the only Faithful, the only Meek, Wife, Holy and Patient, until <HI>all</HI> with an un|wavering. Tongue, &s;hall cry, Thou art altogether Lovely, worthy is the Lamb of the Kingdom and Glory. But lea&s;t any who are u&s;ed to plea&s;e them&s;elves with Mankind, having men's per&s;ons in admi|ration, &s;hould think we deal hardly with the &s;aints of old, (for it is often found more dangerous, even among Chri&s;tians, to &s;peak lightly of the pious men, than it is to &s;peak &s;o of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>) when we &s;av that they were not the men which they are repre&s;ented to be, their conduct and behaviour con&s;idered:&mdash;I would here pre|mi&s;e what will be equally obnoxious unto them, that tho&s;e per&s;ons were really <PB N="128" REF="046269_0161_1021177821745C90">what the &s;criptures &s;ay they were, that is, Righteous, Faithful, Meek, Holy, Wi&s;e, Patient, &amp;c. without any exception: they were &s;o in <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> I know the Jew, however Chri&s;tiani&s;ed by Profe&s;&s;ion, will either rave or &s;neer at this; but let him; He that &s;itteth in the Heavens will laugh him to &s;corn: and the Chri&s;tians <HI>indeed,</HI> will remain undi&s;turbed. I would calm|ly a&s;k, what is the medium between <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and Man?&mdash;If its not true of them in them&s;elves, as I have &s;hewn it is not; nor true of them in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as the Greek and Jew in&s;inuates, where is it true of them? It mu&s;t have its <HI>truth</HI> &s;omewhere; I &s;peak unto you who acknowledge the &s;criptures. I am well aware of your An&s;wer, viz. the Divine Wi&s;dom characteri&s;es them according to what they were in <HI>part</HI> and not in the <HI>whole.</HI> I would a&s;k ano|ther que&s;tion, Have we any other Rule for the trial of right and wrong, good and evil, than the Divine Law? And doth not the Law demand perfection? Doth it not when broken in one point, declare the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or guilty of the whole? Doth it not cur&s;e whom&s;oever continueth not to do all things written in the Book thereof? And <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;aith, that Heaven and Earth <PB N="129" REF="046269_0162_1021177D16BDCAE8">&s;hall pa&s;s away, but one jot or tittle of the Law &s;hall not fail, until the whole be fulfilled. But having &s;poken of this mat|ter before, I refer you unto it: and &s;hall only ob&s;erve here, the arrogance and im|propriety of a&s;&s;uming the Character of Righteous, Meek, Faithful, Holy, &amp;c. according to the works of our own Hands or habits of the Heart: This is flying in the face of God, and giving the lie to the Divine Perfections as revealed in the Law; yea, it is in fact a denying our only Lord God and <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> for unto what Pur|po&s;e is he made Wi&s;dom, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Sanctification and Redemption? Is it not that who&s;oever glorieth, &s;hould glory in the Lord? But when Per&s;ons a&s;&s;ume tho&s;e Characters from the con&s;ideration of what they are in part, as in them&s;elves; they glory in them&s;elves and not in the Lord. This is that Antichri&s;t of whom we were told that He &s;hould come, yea, was &s;o early in the World as the Days of the Apo&s;tles; and prevails &s;o mightily in the Chri&s;tian World at pre&s;ent that the generality of Chri&s;tains under <HI>his</HI> influence, are upon a level in Faith and Doctrine with the Jews: or but very faintly di&s;tingui&s;hed from them: The <HI>Jew</HI> maintains the nece&s;&s;ity <PB N="130" REF="046269_0163_102117803AD21B00">of inward, and outward holine&s;s in every Man, and looks for the <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to come: The <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> e&s;pecially the reformed, with &s;uperior ardour, and repeated a&s;&s;e|verations, declares for the &s;ame way of holine&s;s, and looks al&s;o for a <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to come; an inward Chri&s;t, con&s;i&s;ting of gracious habits, pious breathings, &s;incere and upright di&s;po&s;itions, and which in effect, is to agree with the Jew, in declar|ing, that the Man of Galilee, who was crucified without the Gates of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> in the reign of <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erius,</HI> was not the true <HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> Or according to the <HI>highe&s;t Idea</HI> of him, was but the figure of an inward and Spiritual <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to come: thus Anti|chri&s;tianly denying the true <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is come in the Fle&s;h. Again there are others, who would be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the <HI>Jew,</HI> by confe&s;&s;ing that the true <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> is come, and that according to his Obedience, Death and Re&s;urrection, he is the remote cau&s;e of Man's Salvation. But, then it &s;eems if he is not applied, he is no <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> at all. Hence it is, that many who call them&s;elves Preachers of the Go&s;pel of <HI>Je|&s;us,</HI> make u&s;e of this expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>An unap|plied Chri&s;t is no Chri&s;t at all.</HI> What can a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> think of &s;uch a vile Phra&s;e a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this?</P>

As a Stranger and Pilgrim, he pa&s;&s;ed through the Worlds which his own Hands had made, and unfeignedly felt the want of &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries and refre&s;hments, which the <HI>Creatures</HI> from <HI>Man</HI> to the <HI>Reptile,</HI> yea even to the &s;malle&s;t <HI>In&s;ect,</HI> thro' his Providence, were abundantly &s;upplied with. In all this, he &s;ought not him&s;elf, but through <HI>all,</HI> his unchangeable Motto was, <HI>Not my Will, but Thine be done:</HI> it being his Meat and his Drink to do the <PB N="147" REF="046269_0180_102117B5ADC1F958">Father's Will. Such was his Self-denial, that tho' he was <HI>that Ju&s;t one</HI>; in his own individual &s;elf, was Holy, Harmle&s;s, Undefiled, &s;eparate from Sinners, made higher than the Heavens; yet was he content to be numbered among&s;t the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors; and to be accounted Sedi|tious, a Rebel, a Glutton, a Wine-bibber, a Bla&s;phemer, a Deceiver, a Demoniack, an Encourager and Ringleader of the mo&s;t notorious Sinners: Unto tho&s;e ac|cu&s;ations, he replied not; but by his <HI>&s;ilence</HI> denying his holy character, he &s;eemingly acknowledged the Charge exhibited again&s;t him,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though as an Individual he was perfectly holy; and the charge of &s;in brought again&s;t him by his enemies, as fal&s;e as Satan: Yet as the Head and Repre&s;entative of the people, as per&s;onating the &s;inner, he confe&s;&s;ed the charge by his &s;i|lence: otherwi&s;e it does not appear, wherefore he was &s;ilent; when the cau&s;e of truth called upon him to make his defence.

<P>Thus &s;eeking, if by any means he might oblige him to deviate from his own Law, and rule of righteou&s;ne&s;s, writ|ten by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and the Prophets. How beautiful his humility! he patiently <PB N="149" REF="046269_0182_102117BBF7F92D88">endured the contradiction of Sinners again&s;t him&s;elf. How con&s;picuous his love, through the things which he &s;uf|fered! many Waters could not quench it, neither could the Floods drown it. His meekne&s;s! how apparent, when as a Lamb led to the &s;laughter, and as a Sheep before her &s;hearers Dumb, he opened not his Mouth: when he was reviled, he reviled not again, nor did he hide his face from &s;hame and &s;pitting, but calmly gave his Back to the &s;miters, and his Cheeks, to them who plucked off the Hair. The&s;e, and every other Godlike di&s;po|&s;ition and perfection, &s;hining in Him, through his Life and Death, renders him at <HI>once</HI> the object of wonder, delight and plea&s;ure.

<P>He is beautiful in the maje&s;ty of his power, and the glory of his kingdom. All power in Heaven and in Earth is given into his Hand. By him Kings reign, and Princes decree Ju&s;tice.

<HEAD>A SUPPLEMENT UNTO THE FOREGOING TREATISE ON THE DOCTRINE OF UNION: EXHIBITING A SPECIMEN OF APOSTOLIC PREACHING.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Manner</HI> of the Apo&s;tles Preaching, appears, when among Jews and Gentiles, they taught that <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> was the Me&s;&s;iah, the Son of God; and that he was crucified unto Death, and on the third Day ro&s;e again from the Dead, for the Forgivene&s;s of Sins, and the Ju&s;tification of Mankind. And this they proved from the pre|dictions of the Prophets, from the pattern &s;hewn unto <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in the Mount, and by undoubted miracles wrought in the Name of that Je&s;us whom they Preached. All who believed their Te&s;timony, were there|by &s;en&s;ible of Salvation: there were no &s;uch doubts as the&s;e among&s;t them then, viz. How do I know whether he died for me, or whether I am particularly intere&s;t|ed in him, &amp;c. Tho&s;e queries and criti|ci&s;ms, are of later date than the Apo&s;to|lic Age: and owe their exi&s;tence unto the wi&s;dom of this world, which in the decline of true Chri&s;tianity, took place of <PB N="155" REF="046269_0188_102117D09CE650C0">that primitive &s;implicity, with which the fir&s;t Preachers of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> bare witne&s;s of Him. They had their ri&s;e from the di&s;tinctions made among&s;t men: of Pre|de&s;tinate, and Reprobate, as unqualified, for the Grace of the Go&s;pel: of Fruit|ful, as having a <HI>right</HI> to believe their per&s;onal intere&s;t in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>: or unfruitful, who&s;e intere&s;t in him is doubtful. Tho&s;e di&s;tinctions once concluded upon, be|tween &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s, and ignorance of the &s;criptures; have, from generation to generation, been carefully handed down: Whil&s;t all the World a&s;&s;ented to them, as traditions of gracious Men, taking it for granted, without <HI>impartial</HI> inquiry, that they were deducible from &s;cripture.</P>
<P>This, by degrees, rendered the things belonging to our peace &s;o intricate, that the knowledge thereof was con&s;idered as wholly confined to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ools. And <HI>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nce</HI> it was, that when a Man believed the Go&s;pel report concerr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> Namely that he was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of God, the Saviour of the World, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be died, and ro&s;e again for our Ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ay, when a man had believed this, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et taught to inquire, how do I know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <PB N="156" REF="046269_0189_102117D225563270">he died for me? whether I am intere&s;ted in him or not? was I &s;ure &s;ays one, that I am prede&s;tinate, I could be ea&s;y: &s;ays another was I but &s;ufficiently convinced, and humbled, I could believe that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> died for me: &s;ays a third, could I but perceive the fruits of the Spirit <HI>in me,</HI> the proper effects and obedience of Faith, <HI>I</HI> could be a&s;&s;ured of <HI>my</HI> intere&s;t in him.</P>
<P>Thus are mankind taught to e&s;tabli&s;h their own righteou&s;ne&s;s: where, upon the authority of &s;ome goodne&s;s wrought <HI>by</HI> them, or found <HI>in</HI> them, they are di|rected to conclude of the love of God to|wards them, and of their per&s;onal inte|re&s;t in <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> But what &s;hall that man do, who is a&s;&s;ured that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart is only evil continually,

And indeed this and what followed was foretold by him, in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians,</HI> where he &s;aid, The day of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hould not come, <PB N="162" REF="046269_0195_102117E331C01D50"><HI>except there come a falling away fir&s;t, and that Man of &s;in be revealed, the &s;on of Perdition, who oppo&s;eth and exalteth him|&s;elf above all that is called God, or that is wor&s;hipped: &s;o that he as God, &s;itteth in the temple of God, &s;hewing him&s;elf that he is God.</HI> It is ea&s;ily &s;een, that this pre|diction is fulfilled. <HI>John</HI> al&s;o &s;aid, that Antichri&s;t was in the world <HI>then,</HI> denying that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was come in the fle&s;h: or, as it &s;ignifies, that he had fini&s;hed the re|demption of Mankind; and con&s;equently taught Men to look for him <HI>yet</HI> to come in <HI>their Fle&s;h:</HI> under the notion of Light, Power, Wi&s;dom, Faithfulne&s;s, Humility, Love, &amp;c. From the appearing of this Antichri&s;t in the world, we may date the AEra of the Apo&s;tacy, or falling away from the Apo&s;tles Doctrine; when Mankind began to entangle each other with their own Inventions. The Apo&s;tles, as I have hinted, preached the Per&s;on of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> the &s;imple facts of his Death and Re&s;ur|rection, as Ju&s;tification and Forgivene&s;s of Sins to the Children of <HI>Adam.</HI> It was enough that their hearers believed their report of the crucified One: and as I ob|&s;erved before, the per&s;ons thus believing, never once que&s;tioned but it was for them, <PB N="163" REF="046269_0196_102117E636147798">becau&s;e hitherto they had not been taught that <HI>any</HI> were excluded from it. Anti|chri&s;t had not as yet the <HI>boldne&s;s</HI> to affirm, that there were &s;ome among&s;t Mankind, who though they heard of the Death and Re&s;urrection of the Lord <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> yea, though they believed it, yet had no right to conclude it was for them. Nor had he as yet, propagated that &s;ubtil di&s;tinc|tion, between the belief of the Truth, and the knowledge of their per&s;onal intere&s;t therein. For in tho&s;e days of undi&s;gui&s;ed truth &amp; &s;implicity, when any man believed the Te&s;timony of the Apo&s;tles concerning <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> his heart exulted in the Truth, no|thing doubtful of his intere&s;t therein. The <HI>belief of the Truth,</HI> and the <HI>purged con&s;cience,</HI> were then in&s;eparable. For the Te&s;timony is, not only that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> died and ro&s;e again, &s;uch as we might hear of &s;ome other Per&s;on, as <HI>Lazarus:</HI> but the <HI>truth</HI> is, that he died for our Sins, and ro&s;e again for our Ju&s;tification: in&s;omuch that believing the truth, nece&s;&s;arily im|plies the knowledge of our per&s;onal inte|re&s;t in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> the latter is always in pro|portion to the former. To di&s;tingui&s;h between the belief of the Truth, and the knowledge of our <HI>intere&s;t</HI> therein, is the <PB N="164" REF="046269_0197_102117E7C17E2808">invention of a Spirit, who profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tianity, would not be thought to be an unbeliever, but at the &s;ame time, hav|ing not the te&s;timony of a <HI>good con&s;cience,</HI> the <HI>inward witne&s;s,</HI> which the &s;criptures affirm to be the ca&s;e with &s;uch who be|lieve: but full retaining a <HI>con&s;cience of &s;in,</HI> he was obliged to &s;cheme this di&s;|tinction; to keep up his credit as a be|liever, but &s;uch a one as was doubtful of his per&s;onal intere&s;t in the truth believed. Yea, and to ward off all cen&s;ure on this account, this doubtfulne&s;s mu&s;t be nou|ri&s;hed and cheri&s;hed, and &s;trongly recom|mended to others, as prudent religious fear; from which we are very rarely to be delivered; and that only in proportion to our <HI>fruitfulne&s;s,</HI> as the effects of the Truth believed. And to make this the more plau&s;ible, it is in&s;inuated that the greate&s;t danger lies on the &s;ide of a con|&s;ident believing; &s;ignifying, that men are rather damned for believing (which is called pre&s;uming) than for doubting; thus from every quarter, Antichri&s;t aims by his Traditions, at making void the Word of God. It is very &s;urprizing to ob&s;erve, after a per&s;on hath made a great bu&s;tle about <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and rai&s;ed a du&s;t, by <PB N="165" REF="046269_0198_102117EAE1638028">propo&s;ing a Truth to be believed, unclog|ed with any conditions what&s;oever in the per&s;on believing; requiring no other qua|lification in him, than what is naturally common to mankind; and that the truth which is thus to be believed, is none other than the &s;imple fact of <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> Death and Re&s;urrection: I &s;ay, after propo&s;ing this, and quarreling with all the world about it, giving the harde&s;t names, even unto &s;uch, who only differed unhappily in the Mode of Expre&s;&s;ion: To find <HI>&s;uch a one</HI> &s;ink to this, that a man may believe the forecited truth, and not know his inte|re&s;t in it; yea, have no intere&s;t at all in it; and that &s;uch who <HI>have</HI> can only know it by their fruits, gives as a &s;triking pro&s;pect of Antichri&s;tian policy, and makes us &s;u&s;pect the intention, where it is propo&s;ed to exalt Chri&s;t alone. The Scriptures a&s;&s;ure us that Mankind as Sin|ners, are intere&s;ted in the Death and Re|&s;urrection of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>: Therefore to ap|prehend and believe that Truth <HI>properly,</HI> is to believe our per&s;onal intere&s;t in him. If it &s;hould be objected, that Chri&s;t doth not now &s;ay to any individual, thy &s;ins are forgiven thee; I an&s;wer, he doth: for what he &s;aid unto <HI>one,</HI> he &s;aith unto <PB N="166" REF="046269_0199_102117EF6420BFB0"><HI>every one</HI> who believeth it: otherwi&s;e, we may &s;ay there is nothing in the Scriptures &s;aid unto us; the Old Te&s;tament being written unto the <HI>Jews</HI>; the New-Te&s;ta|ment, &s;ome to one Church and &s;ome to another, but none to us: If we have not a right to believe that what <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;aid unto them, he &s;aid unto us; but, that we can only know our intere&s;t in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> by our fruits; is fir&s;t a denial of the wit|ne&s;s of the &s;pirit; except it is &s;uppo&s;ed that he bears witne&s;s by tho&s;e things, and not by <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>: which by the way, is to &s;peak of him&s;elf, &amp; prove him&s;elf a Spirit of Error. Again, it is to make our goodne&s;s e&s;&s;en|tial to the knowledge of our Salvation, which is a manife&s;t going about to e&s;tab|li&s;h our own righteou&s;ne&s;s, as the <HI>medium at lea&s;t</HI> whereby we believe; and a con|tradiction to the Scripture; which &s;aith, <HI>To him who worketh not, but believeth on him that ju&s;tifieth the Ungodly, his faith is counted for righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Again, it makes void the law: by not adhering to its determination, concerning good and evil: for were we always to determine of our good and evil by the perfect law, it would be much more ea&s;y, with the great|e&s;t pretender to piety, to <HI>number</HI> his good <PB N="167" REF="046269_0200_102117F48488DBB0">fruits, than it is to <HI>find</HI> them. Was <HI>this</HI> but truly con&s;idered among&s;t mankind, we &s;hould not have &s;uch proud boa&s;tings, and preten&s;ions to know <HI>this,</HI> and the <HI>o|ther</HI> matter, by their good works, and holy fruits, as we <HI>have</HI> in the world. I might &s;ay, it &s;mells much &s;tronger of the Church of Rome, (if it does not look a little to|wards Dei&s;m) than of the Prote&s;tant Faith; but as that would be &s;aying no|thing, to &s;uch who think the Romi&s;h Faith true, and the Prote&s;tant wrong; I &s;hall content my&s;elf with &s;aying, that it is a flat contradiction of the Apo&s;tles Te&s;ti|mony, as I have in part, and &s;hall yet fur|ther &s;hew; though it would fain &s;helter it&s;elf under their Authority. Where tho&s;e, and the like Sugge&s;tions of Anti|chri&s;t take place in any Heart, the Con|&s;equences are &s;hocking; as to &s;uch who are <HI>vain</HI> enough to imagine them&s;elves fruitful in <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> and from thence to draw conclu&s;ions; as they mu&s;t fir&s;t make to them&s;elves a new Law, before they can thus think: &s;o mu&s;t they of nece&s;&s;ity be puffed up, and come into the character of the &s;elf-righteous. And, as to &s;uch who are not &s;ufficiently vain, to think them&s;elves thus fruitful, as they cannot <PB N="168" REF="046269_0201_1020EFE657760EC8">know their intere&s;t in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> there re|mains nought for them but mi&s;ery and fear; though they have <HI>this</HI> con&s;olation, to be taught that unbelief and gloom, is a much le&s;s dangerous &s;tate, than an un&s;ha|ken confidence. It is ea&s;ily &s;een, that tho&s;e propo&s;itions are calculated to mul|tiply and increa&s;e the perplexities, doubts, and objections of Mankind, again&s;t the Go&s;pel of Je&s;us: therefore is it, that we have many more of tho&s;e in the world <HI>now,</HI> than in the fir&s;t ages of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tles preached <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and his Benefits, promi&s;cuou&s;ly to &s;inners, and did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reighten his Grace, by &s;hewing that there were &s;ome who had no right to it; either from their being <HI>reprobated</HI> or from their being <HI>unqualified</HI>; but by Divine Authority, they preached the Go&s;|pel to every Creature, and every Man who was a Sinner, yea whether he knew him|&s;elf &s;uch or not, (for they &s;pake of things as true with God, and not according to the conceptions of man) was &s;ufficiently <HI>qualified,</HI> and had an indi&s;putable right, to conclude the Saviour's Death, and Re&s;urrection, <HI>his</HI> Ju&s;tification unto Life. And this much is to be under&s;tood by the <PB N="169" REF="046269_0202_102117F95F7BEBD8">Apo&s;tles a&s;&s;ertions, <HI>We preach Chri&s;t cru|cified.</HI> And again, <HI>We preach not our&s;elves, but Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Lord: And with great power, gave the Apo&s;tles witne&s;s of the Re&s;ur|rection of the Lord Je&s;us; and great Grace was upon them all.</HI> And again, <HI>he preached unto them Je&s;us, and the Re&s;urrection.</HI> Thus, the Apo&s;tles dwelt altogether upon the fact of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Death and Re&s;urrection among&s;t <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Greeks,</HI> as the alone &s;alvation of Mankind. And what <HI>Paul</HI> him&s;elf thought of it, is evident from that Heart exultation of his, <HI>Who is he that condemneth, it is Chri&s;t that died, yea rather that is ri&s;en again:</HI> Thus the re|&s;urrection of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> without the con&s;ide|ration of any other matter, in <HI>Heaven</HI> or in <HI>Earth,</HI> was the Joy of his Heart: Yea all his Hope, and all his Salvation. He &s;hewed, that the fact of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s re&s;urrec|tion, was his exemption from condemna|tion: He viewed it, and rejoiced in it, as &s;uch. And without doubt, what he ap|prehended to be Truth, he preached un|to others, as he &s;ought not him&s;elf, in the things which he &s;pake: The Glory of the Lord <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and the happine&s;s of his fel|low-creatures, being that which he had always in view, in preaching the Kingdom <PB N="170" REF="046269_0203_102117FCB19A16F0">of God. As to Mankind, the Apo&s;tles thought them &s;ufficiently qualified, (as be|ing all concluded under Sin) for the Grace which they preached. They were taught to drop all di&s;tinctions, and no longer to con&s;ider men as <HI>clean</HI> and <HI>unclean,</HI> as <HI>cho|&s;en</HI> and <HI>rejected:</HI> For &s;aith <HI>Peter,</HI> the Lord hath &s;hewed me, that I &s;hould not call any Man <HI>common</HI> or <HI>unclean.</HI> This was not becau&s;e mankind were reformed and better <HI>now,</HI> than when God taught the <HI>Jews</HI> to re&s;pect the <HI>Gentiles</HI> as common and unclean; which he did under the Law; where he forbid the <HI>Jews,</HI> to have any connection with the <HI>Gentiles</HI>; and, if it was not owing to any Change in the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> that they were now received, and were no longer to be con&s;idered as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> and <HI>unclean,</HI> The Query is, What was it owing to? I an&s;wer, it was unto the Death and Re&s;urrection of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>; for it was there that God had clean&s;ed them. Therefore was it, that when <HI>Peter</HI> refu&s;ed to eat, in the Vition of the Sheet, &s;aying, Nothing that was <HI>unclean,</HI> had at any time come into his mouth; He was an&s;wered, Call not thou that <HI>common</HI> and <HI>unclean</HI> which God hath clean&s;ed. Thus was he taught, that mankind who in <HI>them&s;elves</HI> <PB N="171" REF="046269_0204_102117FFA6BA17D0">were <HI>unclean,</HI> were clean&s;ed of God in <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI>: according to which <HI>clean&s;ing,</HI> he was in&s;tructed to re&s;pect them; and that he ought not any more to call <HI>any Man uncommon or unclean.</HI> Therefore, it was the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Apo&s;tles, to tell the People what God had done for them: Namely, that he had loved them, and wa&s;hed them from their &s;ins, in his own Blood. Thus as to <HI>Matter,</HI> and <HI>Manner,</HI> did the fir&s;t witne&s;&s;es of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> preach his Salvation unto the Children of Men. For where they tell us, that they preached the Son of God; that they preached <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI> the Lord, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> crucified, &amp;c. with|out meddling with the characters and conditions of tho&s;e unto whom they preached, to point them out, as qualified or unqualified for the reception of the Truth. I &s;ay, this their Matter and Manner of Preaching, plainly &s;hews, that they did not aim at making a &s;chi&s;m in the Body, by dividing the Head and Mem|bers, as having &s;eparate intere&s;ts: But, they aimed at &s;hewing that the intere&s;t of the Head, was that of the Members: therefore was it, that holding the Head, they con&s;tantly preached <HI>his</HI> Excellence, <HI>his</HI> Labours, Triumphs and Honours; that the people as his Members, hearing of it, <PB N="172" REF="046269_0205_10211802969520C0">might hear of their own &s;alvation and grace; becau&s;e, the glory which is given unto him, as the Head, he gives to us, as his Members. From this <HI>Union,</HI> it appears, that hearing and believing of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> according to the Apo&s;tles te&s;timo|ny, we hear and believe, what truly re|lates unto our&s;elves. And thus did they, by preaching the Obedience, Death, Re|&s;urrection and A&s;cen&s;ion of the Lord <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> preach the &s;alvation of Mankind in him; thus lifting <HI>him</HI> up that he might draw all men unto him; and, that they might e&s;pou&s;e the people unto this <HI>one</HI> Hu&s;band, as cha&s;te virgins unto this <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> they were cautious of meddling with the Characters of their Hearers, as <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Gentiles,</HI> as Repentant or Unre|pentant, le&s;t by making a Di&s;tinction, tho&s;e who thought them&s;elves on the fa|vorable &s;ide of the que&s;tion, &s;hould be lifted up, and their minds be adulterated, and rendered uncha&s;te to the Crucified one: Nay, they had always <HI>cau&s;ticks</HI> at hand, for the proud Fle&s;h of their Di&s;ci|ples, wherever they &s;aw it ri&s;ing; and this they applied without fear, or hav|ing the per&s;ons of men in re&s;pect, when|ever they &s;aw occa&s;ion. And how care|ful <HI>Paul</HI> was in this particular, appears <PB N="173" REF="046269_0206_10211805DB76D2A0">from his reproving <HI>Peter,</HI> for giving the lea&s;t occa&s;ion to the <HI>Jews</HI> to glory in the Fle&s;h, and keep up a di&s;tinction, which God had before &s;hewn him an end of; where he actually forbad him to call that common and unclean, which he had clean&s;ed.</P>
<P>This is a &s;hort &s;pecimen of the Apo&s;|tles Matter and Manner of Preaching: and according to <HI>my</HI> Apprehen&s;ion, it is obvious that they had the Union between <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and the people in view, when they thus preached.</P>
<P>There are many who re&s;pect the Epi&s;tles, written by the Apo&s;tles to the Churches, as a pattern of their preach|ing: but they are to con&s;ider, that there is a wide difference between private Letters, written unto &s;uch who already believed on the Lord <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> wherein there is promi&s;cuou&s;ly thrown out &s;uch hints, as were de&s;igned to e&s;tabli&s;h their Faith, and form their Manners. I &s;ay, a real difference between tho&s;e, and their man|ner of preaching in publick, where having to do with the Multitude, their only &s;ubject was the Per&s;on, Death, and Re&s;ur|rection of the Lord <HI>Je&s;us</HI>; of which their &s;ermons recorded in the Acts of <PB N="174" REF="046269_0207_1021180A18911000">the Apo&s;tles are in&s;tances. But &s;ince then there has been a great <HI>falling away,</HI> and <HI>the man of &s;in is revealed.</HI> And, as it is more than probable that the Day of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is at hand, <HI>Antichri&s;t</HI> hath great wrath, and &s;trives to the utmo&s;t extent of his Power and Cunning, to hinder the revival of the Apo&s;tolic Te&s;timony, and the ri&s;ing of the witne&s;&s;es. Sometimes he &s;eeks to e&s;tabli&s;h his own Maxims, under the popular names of Virtue, Benevolence, Repentance, Faith, Fruit|fulne&s;s, &amp;c. Then he calumniates the Te&s;timony of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> giving it the mo&s;t opprobrious characters, and mad with rage again&s;t all the witne&s;&s;es thereof, breathes forth nothing but &s;laughter and threatnings. And many are they, whom he either prevails on to adopt his Maxims and become his willing di&s;ciples, or &s;o intimidates with his Threatnings, that they dare not embrace the Truth, becau&s;e of the certain reproach that follows. But let him rage, he has but a &s;hort time, ere the Lord <HI>&s;hall con&s;ume him with the &s;pirit of his mouth,</HI> and de&s;|troy him with the <HI>brightne&s;s of his coming</HI>: and then &s;hall the witne&s;&s;es who now lie &s;lain in the &s;treets of the great city, &s;tand again upon their feet; and the ancient Te&s;timony be revived.</P>
