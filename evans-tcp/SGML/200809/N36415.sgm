<HEAD>Shocking Narrative, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ON <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> 24th day of March 1794, the brig Falmouth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> from Port Royal, Jamaica, bound to Belfa&s;t, in Ireland, to which place &s;he belonged. At the time &s;he &s;ailed, the following per&s;ons were on board:</P>
<P><HI>William Corran,</HI> Ma&s;ter. <HI>Francis Turner,</HI> Mate. <HI>Hen|ry Gilmore, John Douthard, &mdash; Boyd, &mdash; Carrol, Jo|&s;eph York,</HI> (Mariners.) <HI>William Williams,</HI> a Cabin Boy. <HI>Jo&s;eph Porter,</HI> a Pa&s;&s;enger. And a Black Boy, Servent to Mr. Porter.</P>
<P>Nothing material happened on the voyage, until two of the hands, <HI>Boyd</HI> and <HI>Carrol,</HI> were taken &s;ick, and di|ed apparently of violent fevers, the one immediately af|ter the other.&mdash;During their illne&s;s, the Captain u&s;ed to inquire after their &s;ituation, and &s;ent frequently from the cabin both Soup and Coffee.</P>
<P>After the death of the&s;e men, which happened previ|ous to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d of May, there appeared an apparent dif|ference in the conduct of the Captain, which &s;hewed it|&s;elf in particular in&s;tances of har&s;h treatment towards one another of the Crew, whom he charged with an intention to poi&s;on him and run away with the ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>Very &s;oon after the death of the Men, they &s;poke an American Schooner, the Ma&s;ter of which Captain <HI>Cor|ran</HI> had before been acquainted with&mdash;and who, on hear|ing that he had lo&s;t two of his men, offered to &s;upply him with two more. Captain <HI>Corran</HI> thanked the American for his friend&s;hip, but told him he would endeavour to do with the hands he had. This circum&s;tance appeared &s;trange to the crew, as the lo&s;s of the men had rendered them but weak handed.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd of May, he took from the Mate a Quad|rant, which he had given him &s;oon after their &s;ailing;
<PB N="4" REF="047599_0004_1023EF3AEC348B28">
and likewi&s;e took from him his books of navigation; tak|ing into his own hands the entire navigatinn of the ve&s;|&s;el.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI> the pa&s;&s;enger, was in an extreme ill &s;tate of health, and was &s;o feeble as to be confined to his bed, which was in the &s;tar board &s;tateroom. In this &s;ituation he lay until the 24th of May, when the Mate being in the larboard &s;tateroom, and the Captain and Mr. <HI>Porter's</HI> &s;ervant in the cabin, the Mate heard Captain <HI>Corran</HI> in warm language, abu&s;ing Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI> &s;wearing that he &s;hould not any longer &s;tay in the &s;tateroom, and ordering his black boy to go immediately and bring his ma&s;ter in|to the cabin. This the boy attempted; but finding him|&s;elf unable to effect it; and Mr. <HI>Porter</HI> at the &s;ame time, begging for God's &s;ake that he might be &s;uffered to lay where he was&mdash;the Captain entered the &s;tateroom, and, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the black boy, took Mr. <HI>Porter</HI> by force, out of his bed, and &s;upporting him him&s;elf under one arm, and the black boy under the other, they brought him into the cabin, (he being unable to walk him&s;elf) and &s;at him down in a chair. The Captain then order|ed the black boy to bring out his ma&s;ter's bed, and to make it up in the cabin, upon two che&s;ts belonging to Mr. <HI>Porter.</HI> This being done, he compelled the black boy to lay his ma&s;ter on the bed, and then &s;ent for one of the top gallant &s;tudding &s;ails, which he made a &s;ort of curtain to &s;urround his bed. After this tran&s;action, he ordered the black boy out of the cabin, and, going upon deck, gave a general order, that neither the black boy, nor any other per&s;on &s;hould come into the cabin without his leave and that no per&s;on &s;hould concern him&s;elf with Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI> as he would take care of him him&s;elf.</P>
<P>On the night of the 26th of May, about Midnight, the Captain &s;ent for the cabin boy; the boy came to him, and the Captain ordered him to fetch a candle; after he had brought it, he damanded of the boy where he had been&mdash;the boy replied, it was his watch be|low: He then ordered him to &s;trip off his jacket, af|ter which he bid him go to the locker and bring him the cat o' nine tails. The boy went to the locker, and told the Captain he could not find it: He threatened to &s;trike him with a cutla&s;s, if he did not find it im|mediately, the boy not being able to find it, he accord|ingly

<P>The 27th of May between the hours of 10 and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> o'clock at night, the Captain called <HI>Henry Gilmore</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ordered him to bring a light. When <HI>Gilmore</HI> can with the light, the Captain gave him a drink of grog and told him that he hoped he would be in his favour, and that he was not afraid of the law. <HI>Gilmore</HI> repli|ed, that he did not wi&s;h to be again&s;t him or any oth|er per&s;on. The Captain &s;oon after came upon deck, and de&s;ired that no per&s;on &s;hould be permitted to come into the cabin, without orders from him, and that the watch then on deck, &s;hould give the &s;ame charge to the watch which was to &s;ucceed them.&mdash;About a quar|ter pa&s;t 12 o'clock the whole crew were alarmed by the cries of Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI> exclaiming "MURDER! MUR|DER! &amp;c."&mdash;Through a hole in the bulk head which parted the &s;teerage from the cabin, and by looking down the companion door, &s;everal of the crew &s;aw Captain <HI>Corran</HI> &s;triking at Mr. <HI>Porter</HI> as he lay in his bed, with a cutla&s;s. After &s;triking him for &s;ome time, he de&s;i&s;ted for a &s;hort &s;pace, and coming up the com|panion ladder, began to abu&s;e Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI> damned him, and declaring that he was not worth five pounds in the world. He than returned into the cabin again, and began to cut Mr. <HI>Porter</HI> as he had done before, Mr. <HI>Porter</HI> again cried out and begged the Captain not to cut him &s;o, but to take a pi&s;tol and &s;hoot him. He damned him, and &s;aid he would not &s;hoot him, but would cut him every half hour until day light. In a &s;hort time, Mr. <HI>Porter</HI> begged him to de&s;i&s;t, as he was

While <HI>Douthard</HI> was in the act <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oing this, he made &s;everal &s;trokes at the body ov|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> his head, which &s;o intimidated <HI>Douthard,</HI> that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ropped the body and ran upon deck, acquainting his companions that the Captain had murdered their pa&s;|&s;enger. At 4 o'clock the Captain came upon deck, and ordered <HI>Douthard</HI> to go down in the cabin, and few Mr. <HI>Porter</HI> up in a blanket, and told him that Mr. <HI>Porter's</HI> &s;ervant &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t him, <HI>Douthard</HI> refu&s;ing to, he &s;eized him, and compelled him by force to go into the cabin. By the Captain's order, with the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the black boy, he laid Mr. <HI>Porter's</HI> body on one of his own blankets, &s;ewed him up in it, and tied a white handkerchief round his head. The body was mangled in a mo&s;t &s;hocking manner, there were large ga&s;hes about the hips, above a foot long, he was al&s;o much cut about the arms: The &s;heet was very bloody and much clotted blood was upon the floor, near the bed. After the body was &s;ewn up, Captain <HI>Corran</HI> or|dered <HI>Douthard</HI> and the black boy to throw it out of the cabin window. <HI>Douthard</HI> told him they were not able, and reque&s;ted his permi&s;&s;ion to call another per|&s;on. He replied, that he would not let any other per|&s;on come into the cabin to help them. On finding, however, that they were not able to effect the purpo&s;e them&s;elves, he con&s;ented that <HI>Henry Gilmore</HI> &s;hould be called. By the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Gilmore</HI> the corps was brought upon deck, and laid upon a board in the gang way. From the companion door to the gang way,
<PB REF="047599_0007_1023EF06D328D4B8">
there was a con&s;iderable quantity of blood which had run through the blanket as they were carrying the body along. While the corps was lying in the gang way, the Captain came upon deck, leaned over the quarter rail, covered his eyes with his hands, and ap|peared for &s;ome minutes much confu&s;ed. He was rou&s;ed from his reverie by <HI>John Douthard,</HI> who a&s;ked him if they &s;hould heave the decea&s;ed overboard. He &s;eemed &s;tartled by the que&s;tion, but bid them "<HI>away with him.</HI>" The body was accordingly committed to the &s;ea. Immediately after this, he ordered the ve&s;&s;el to be kept away N. W. and &s;et the &s;tudding &s;ails.</P>
<P>The Mate was obliged to keep out of the Captain's way, and was once forced to go into the fore top&mdash; and at other times to conceal him&s;elf in the hold, as he had threatened to take away his life, and had pur|&s;ued him apparently for that purpo&s;e&mdash;being whenever he came upon deck, con&s;tantly armed with a cutla&s;s and a pair of pi&s;tols.</P>
<P>On the 29th of May, the Captain &s;ent &s;everal me&s;|&s;ages to the Mate, de&s;iring him to come upon deck, and declaring that he would not hurt him. The Mate accordingly came up the fore &s;cuttle, and being afraid to go aft, remained behind the windla&s;s: Captain <HI>Cor|ran</HI> ob&s;erving his &s;hyne&s;s, and that his eye appeared perpetually on him, told him <HI>he kept a damned, &s;harp look out:</HI> After this he went down into the cabin, and kept for a con&s;iderable time, hammering with a maul, whch led the crew to fear that he wanted to force out the lumber port in order to founder the ve&s;&s;el. But it afterwards appeared that he was driving a great number of &s;pikes into the after &s;cuttle to fa&s;ten it down.&mdash;About noon, <HI>Henry Gilmore</HI> who had been &s;teering, was relieved from the helm, and came for|ward where the Mate was, who inquired of him what cour&s;e they were &s;teering. He informed him N. W. &mdash;On which the Mate replied, that that cour&s;e would fetch no port in Europe, and that he was apprehen|&s;ive that the Captain had ill de&s;igns, both on them and the ve&s;&s;el. The Mate then con&s;ulted as many of the crew as he conveniently could, who agreed to take the fir&s;t opportunity to &s;ecure the Captain. About an hour afterwards the Captain came on deck, and having
<PB REF="047599_0008_1023EF3EDED0C758">
walked to the tiller ropes, and turned round to pro|ceed down the deck, <HI>Jo&s;eph York,</HI> who was then at the helm, &s;eized his arms behind, and &s;truggling with him, the re&s;t of the crew came to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, bound him, and brought him into the cabin, where they &s;ecured his hands with a pair of hand cuffs which they found in his che&s;t.</P>
<P>Previous to his impri&s;onment, when he ordered the ve&s;&s;el, to be &s;teered N. W. he informed the crew that they were near the Engli&s;h Channel: But on the 30th of May when the mate had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Quad|rant, and was enabled to take an ob&s;ervation, he found they were very near the latitude of Halifax, and in a|bout half an hour after they &s;aw land; but a thick fog coming on, they were not able to make a harbour until four days afterwards, when they came to anchor in Ro&s;e Bay between La Have and Lunenburgh, On &s;earching for the books of Navigation, after confining the Captain, they found that he had cut out of every book the Table of the Sun's Declination.&mdash;Immediate|ly on their arrival there the Mate went on &s;hore, and made report to the magi&s;trates of the tran&s;action o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> board the Brig Falmouth.&mdash;The Captain was carried on &s;hore, and the Depo&s;itions of the people being tak|en, he was committed to pri&s;on, and afterwards brought to Halifax, where the Court of Admiralty was a&s;&s;em|bled on Friday the 11th of July at the Court Hou&s;e, for the Trial of this unfortunate Man, for the murder of Jo&s;eph Porter, a gentleman who took a pa&s;&s;age on board the Brig Falmouth, at Port Royal, Jamaica.&mdash; The Court being opened with the cu&s;tomary &s;olemni|ties, the pri&s;oner was arraigned, and pleaded not guilty, was remanded for trial on Monday. On that day the trial commenced, and continued, by adjourment, until Tue&s;day, when the examination on the part of the Crown being ended&mdash;the Pri&s;oner was called upon by the Court to make his defence: But declining to offer any thing in his defence&mdash;he was again recommitted, and the Court adjourned to nine o'clock on Tue&s;day. On Tue&s;day the Court again a&s;&s;embled, and the Pri&s;on|er having nothing to &s;ay in his defence, the Court was ordered to be cleared. After a &s;hort period the Court was again opened and the Pri&s;oner brought to the Bar,
<PB N="9" REF="047599_0009_1023EF090A49CA00">
when his Excellency Governor Wentworth, the Pre&s;|ident of the Court, addre&s;&s;ed the pri&s;oner; and declar|ed, that the Court have deliberately con&s;idered all the evidence which had been &s;ubmitted to them, were u|nanimou&s;ly of opinion that he was guilty of the murder of JOSEPH PORTER. His Excellency then demanded of the Pri&s;oner if he had any thing to urge, why &s;en|tence of Death &s;hould not be pronounced upon him. After he&s;itating a few moments, the Pri&s;oner began an imperfect narration of the proceedings on board the Brig Falmouth, from her &s;ailing from Jamaica, pa&s;&s;ing over the period when the murder was committed, of which, however, he declared he was not guilty. Hav|ing nothing further to offer, the Pre&s;ident pronounced the awful Sentence of Death upon him, and he was adjudged to be hanged on Monday the 21&s;t of July, between the hours of one and two o'clock at Point Plea&s;ant, between the ebbing and flowing of the tide.</P>
<P>On Monday the 21&s;t of July this unhappy man, was carried from the Pri&s;on to the Beach at Point Plea&s;ant, where he &s;atisfied, by the forfeiture of his life, the in|jured Laws of the Country.</P>
<P>The foregoing Narrative contains every material fact related on the Trial of <HI>William Corran</HI>; and perhaps there never was a Trial in which every witne&s;s called, &s;o perfectly corroborated the te&s;timony of his fellow. &mdash;But in the mid&s;t of this coincidence of evidence, the mind is left at a lo&s;s for a clew, by which to unrav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l the motive that could induce Captain <HI>Corran</HI> to com|mit a Murder, attended by &s;o many aggravated circum|&s;tances.&mdash;The witne&s;&s;es all declared, they were unable to a&s;&s;ign any rea&s;on&mdash;that they knew of no quarrel that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him and the decea&s;ed, previous to the 24th of May, when he was ordered out of the &s;tate room;&mdash;that previous to that period he had treated Mr. <HI>Porter</HI> very kindly&mdash;and that his uniform conduct, both in the pa&s;&s;age from Belfa&s;t to Jamaica and on the pa&s;&s;age home, until the 2d of May, had been &s;uch as to give no ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint to any of them.</P>
<P>Many have conjectured that a temporary in&s;anity, at lea&s;t mu&s;t have been the occa&s;ion of this horrid deed. To this conjecture every feeling mind mu&s;t wi&s;h to &s;ub&s;cribe, e&s;pecially when the te&s;timony of re&s;pectable
<PB N="10" REF="047599_0010_1023EF415C6AD760">
per&s;ons who have known Captain <HI>Corran</HI> previous to this tran&s;action, unite in de&s;cribing him as a man, di&s;|tingui&s;hed by the general quietne&s;s and inoffen&s;ivene&s;s of his manners.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Corran</HI> was born in Ireland, in the town of Port a Ferre, in the County of Down. He was a man of middle &s;tature&mdash;of a robu&s;t, athletick habit, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing great bodily &s;trength and activity. He was in the 32d year of his age, and has left a father, two broth|ers and a &s;i&s;ter, to lament his untimely end.</P>
<P>He was in this place a few years ago, being then a forema&s;t hand on board a &s;hip laden with Provi&s;ions from Ireland. His activity and behaviour, were &s;o plea|&s;ing to the Captain, that before he left this port, he ap|pointed him mate of the &s;hip.</P>
<P>What a contra&s;t do the plea&s;ing ideas that floated in his imagination at this period of his fir&s;t advancement in life form with the painful reflections that mu&s;t have crowded into his mind in his la&s;t painful vi&s;it to <HI>Hali|fax.</HI> He feelingly noticed the contra&s;t him&s;elf&mdash; "Here" he exclaimed, "I was fir&s;t made mate of a ve&s;&s;el"&mdash;and he&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ating, he &s;eemed by this manner as if he would have added. "Here all my worldly pro&s;|pects end&mdash;here I mu&s;t make my exit."</P>
<P>At the mention of his father's name by a gentleman who attended him in his la&s;t moments, he bur&s;t into a flood of tears, and appeared more affected by a con|templation of the di&s;tre&s;s his death mu&s;t occa&s;ion to his parent, than he had ever &s;hewn on his own account.</P>
