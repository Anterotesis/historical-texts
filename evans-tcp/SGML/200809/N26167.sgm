month of May, in the year 1797, at his hou&s;e in Wilkes county. That the &s;aid Carrick came to his hou&s;e the day before any propo&s;itions were made, and tarried all night. That he appeared to know this deponent, and &s;aid he had &s;een him about ten years before, in Savannah, tho' this deponent could not call to his mind that he had ever &s;een the &s;aid Carrick before&mdash;that during the evening he talked much of the exi&s;ting war between France, Spain, and England&mdash;that the day after his arrival, &s;ome little time after breakfa&s;t he informed this deponent that he was a Briti&s;h captain then from Charle&s;ton, and intended to return there as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, by the way of Savan|nah, where he expected to &s;ee Col. John M'Into&s;h, and that he was authorized by the Briti&s;h government to pro|po&s;e to this deponent 10,000 dollars, as mentioned in the &s;aid letter, as a &s;alary, if he, this deponent, would engage in the Briti&s;h &s;ervice, again&s;t the Spaniards and French; and this deponent &s;hould hold in the &s;aid &s;ervice, the &s;ame rank that he held in the &s;tate of Georgia.</P>
<P>That the &s;aid propo&s;als were oral, and not in writing: And this deponent further &s;aith, that after he had con|temptuou&s;ly refu&s;ed to clo&s;e with the &s;aid propo&s;itions, the &s;aid Carrick a&s;ked this deponent, if any &s;um would engage this deponent to enter into the &s;ervice of the Bri|ti&s;h government?

That the de&s;ign, &s;cheme or enterprize was not di&s;clo&s;ed to this deponent: And that the &s;aid Carrick left the hou&s;e of this deponent in one half hour, he believes, after the &s;aid propo&s;itions were made and re|jected.</P>

<P>ON the 23d of November la&s;t, the Mini&s;ter Ple|nipotentiary of his Catholic Maje&s;ty, commu|nicated to the Committee of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of the United States, charged to enquire into the nature and extent of the con&s;piracy of William Blount, a letter purporting to have been written by General Elijah Clark, of Georgia, to the Spani&s;h Con&s;ul, at Charle&s;ton, (S. C.) dated "State of Georgia,&mdash;Wa&s;hington, 9th Augu&s;t, 1797," and containing a declaration in the fol|lowing words&mdash;
<Q>An application was made to me from the Briti&s;h, through a channel which bound me to &s;i|lence, if not acquie&s;ced in, and this que&s;tion a&s;ked me by that per&s;on,&mdash;Whether a &s;alary of 10,000 dollars would or would not induce me to join the Briti&s;h?</Q>
&mdash;The Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives having deemed it pro|per to inve&s;tigate the contents of this letter, and, if pos|&s;ible, to obtain a di&s;clo&s;ure of the application to which it refers, have, for that purpo&s;e, appointed a committee
<Q><PB N="5" REF="034786_0005_0FFF5EA627ECCF58">with in&s;tructions to take all &s;uch &s;teps as may be ne|ce&s;&s;ary for obtaining the te&s;timony of the &s;aid General Clark or any other per&s;on or per&s;ons, touching the &s;ubject matter of the &s;aid letter.</Q></P>
<P>You will receive herewith, a copy of the report of the late committee, referring to and including the letter of General Clark; and al&s;o a copy of the re&s;olution of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of the 2d of February in|&s;tant, for the appointment of the pre&s;ent committee.</P>
<P>Being informed that you re&s;ide in the vicinity of Ge|neral Clark, and having perfect confidence in your zeal and attachment to the welfare of our common country, we have thought that we could not better di&s;charge the functions a&s;&s;igned to us by the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, than by delegating to you the care of the examination of the &s;aid General Clark, and of &s;uch other witne&s;&s;es in the &s;tate of Georgia, as from his information, or from any circum&s;tances within your knowledge, you may be led to believe can throw any light on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance, therefore, of the powers and duties committed to us by the &s;aid re&s;olution, of the 2d of Fe|bruary, 1798, we do hereby reque&s;t and authorize you, or any two or more of you, to call before you, at &s;uch place as you &s;hall appoint, and as &s;oon as conveniently may be, after the receipt hereof, the &s;aid General Elijah Clark, and to examine him, upon oath, in relation to the premi&s;es, on the interrogatories accompanying this letter, and on &s;uch others as may appear to you to be proper or nece&s;&s;ary to effect the de&s;ired di&s;clo&s;ure, or which may grow out of the examination.</P>
<P>We do further reque&s;t and authorize you, or any two or more of you, to cau&s;e to appear before you, &s;uch other per&s;on or per&s;ons as you may deem to have any knowledge of the &s;ubject of this enquiry; and to exam|ine &s;uch per&s;on or per&s;ons, touching the &s;ame, on oath, on &s;uch interrogatories as the occa&s;ion may require: and to make return of the &s;aid interrogatories and examina|tions, as &s;oon as may be, to the committee afore&s;aid, at Philadelphia.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="034786_0006_0FFF5ED9A57F8490">The recited paragraph from the letter of General Clark &s;tates, that the application, alluded to, was made to him under injunctions of &s;ilence. A good citizen will have no &s;ecrets in relation to &s;ubjects involving the intere&s;ts or welfare of his country: And the committee have no doubt that General Clark, paying re&s;pect to the high au|thority of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, will make, without any he&s;itation, a full and particular di&s;clo&s;ure of all the circum&s;tances relative to this application: the more e&s;pecially, as having already departed from the in|junction &s;o far as to mention, that &s;uch an application had been made to him, it becomes more &s;trongly his du|ty, now, to relieve the anxiety which this partial commu|nication has produced. You will pre&s;ent the&s;e con&s;ide|rations to him in &s;uch manner as you &s;hall think mo&s;t likely to be effectual, and to prevent the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;um|moning General Clark to the &s;eat of government.</P>
<P>The expen&s;es which may be nece&s;&s;arily incurred in the execution of the bu&s;ine&s;s hereby committed to your care, will be reimbur&s;ed to your order on the Clerk of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives.</P>

<P>SIR&mdash;I RECEIVED your letter by Major Patton, reque&s;ting me to inform you the propo&s;itions and per|&s;ons who made them to me re&s;pecting my junction with the Briti&s;h. The peculiar and delicate manner in which the&s;e propo&s;itions were made, and the delicacy with which the whole bu&s;ine&s;s was conducted, prevents me from giving you that &s;atisfaction on the &s;ubject which I wi&s;h. I can only &s;ay that an application was made to me from the Briti&s;h, through a channel which bound me to &s;ilence if not acquie&s;ced in: And this que&s;tion a&s;ked me by that per&s;on&mdash;Whether a &s;alary of ten thou&s;and dol|lars would or would not induce me to join the Briti&s;h? I an&s;wered that no &s;um could ever induce me to join the Briti&s;h upon any occa&s;ion whatever. In fact I reject|ed the offer with di&s;dain. Could I be more explicit up|on the &s;ubject, I would gratify you with plea&s;ure, but from the circum&s;tances heretofore mentioned, I am con|fident your good &s;en&s;e will dictate, that &s;ilence on my part is the mo&s;t prudent act.</P>
