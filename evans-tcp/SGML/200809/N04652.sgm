<HEAD>A <HI>TREATY</HI> between His Excellency the Governor of the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> and the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and other <HI>Indian</HI> Nations, depending on &s;aid Province.</HEAD>
<P>IT is well known in the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> that the <HI>Six Nations</HI> of <HI>Indians</HI> depending in this Province, (called <HI>Iroquois</HI> by the <HI>French</HI>) had lately on &s;everal Occa&s;ions, appear'd di&s;&s;atisfied and wavering in their Fidelity to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Crown. No doubt, this was principally occa&s;ion'd by the Artifices of the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Canada,</HI> who had con&s;tantly Emi&s;&s;aries among them: But at the &s;ame Time there is Rea&s;on to think, the &s;u&s;picious Behaviour of the&s;e Nations, in Favour of their once inveterate Enemy the <HI>French,</HI> could not have arriv'd to the Pitch it did, otherwi&s;e than by &s;ome Neglects or Mi&s;conduct of tho&s;e who were entru&s;ted by the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> with the Management of the <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs.</P>
<P>His Excellency the Governor of <HI>New-York,</HI> having received his Maje&s;ty's Commands, to engage the <HI>Indian</HI> Nations depending on his Government, to join in the Expedition then intended again&s;t <HI>Canada,</HI> and to make them the u&s;ual Pre&s;ents on that Occa&s;ion; and being &s;en&s;ible of the great U&s;e the&s;e <HI>Nations</HI> may be to the Succe&s;s of this Enterprize, and likewi&s;e of the Difficulties that probably might attend his Endeavours at this Time, was de&s;irous to have had the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of as many of the Members of his Maje&s;ty's Council as the Circum&s;tances of Affairs would permit; but they all declined to give their Attendance, except Mr. <HI>Colden</HI> and Mr. <HI>Living &s;ton.</HI> His Excellency was therefore obliged to act with the &s;malle&s;t Number of Members, which by his Maje&s;ty's Commi&s;&s;ion can form a Council, <HI>viz.</HI> Three; the above two Gentlemen and Capt. <HI>Rutherford,</HI> who was then at his Po&s;t in <HI>Albany.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as his Excellency received his Maje&s;ty's Commands, he di&s;patched from <HI>Albany</HI> &s;uch Per&s;ons as, by the be&s;t Information he could receive, had Influence among the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> to invite them &s;everally to meet him at <HI>Albany,</HI> on the 20<HI>th</HI> of <HI>July.</HI> His Excellency arrived at <HI>Albany</HI> the 21<HI>&s;t</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> where having heard, that, be&s;ides the Small-Pox, (which his Excellency never had) many were &s;ick of a contagious malignant Fever, he continued on board the Sloop which carried him up, to con&s;ider where to lodge with the lea&s;t Danger to his Per&s;on from the Infection of the&s;e Di&s;tempers; and the next Morning re&s;olved to go into the Fort. He was received at his Landing with the u&s;ual Marks of Re&s;pect from the Corporation, the Independent Companies of regular Troops then in the Place, and the Militia, under a Di&s;charge of the Cannon of the Fort and Town.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon of the &s;ame Day on which his Excellency came on Shore, three <HI>Indians, viz.</HI> Two <HI>Onandagos</HI> and an <HI>Oneydo,</HI> brought two <HI>French</HI> Scalps and pre&s;ented to his Excellency: At which Time the Leader of the Party made a formal Speech to the following Purpo&s;e: <Q>That having had repeated Accounts of the Mi&s;chief done by the <HI>French,</HI> and of the frequent Murders committed by them, and that the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> notwith&s;tanding of their Profe&s;&s;ions of Friend&s;hip, &s;uffered this Blood&s;hed to remain unrevenged, 
<PB N="4" REF="005791_0003_1026EEA68E38FDC0">
his Heart could bear it no longer; he thereupon re&s;olved to open for his Brethren the Path to Revenge: That the&s;e two Scalps which he now pre&s;ented were taken at Noon Day in Sight of the <HI>French</HI> Fort at <HI>Crown Point.</HI></Q> His Excellency told him how well he took this &s;pecial Mark of his Fidelity, and a&s;&s;ured him, that he would not only now reward him and his Companions, by particular Pre&s;ents, but would always remember this Act of Friend&s;hip. They had already received the Reward given by the Act of A&s;&s;embly. His Excellency gave each of them four <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dollars; to the Leader a fine laced Coat and Hat, and a Silver Brea&s;t-Plate; and to each of the others a Stroud Blanket and lac'd Hat.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> told us, that they lay &s;everal Days among the Bu&s;hes, from whence they could &s;ee every Man that came out of the Fort-Gate. They endeavoured for &s;ome time to take a Pri&s;oner, but ob&s;erving that none went to &s;uch a Di&s;tance from the Fort that they could hope to carry him off, they re&s;olved to take the fir&s;t Opportunity for a Scalp: Two Soldiers coming out of the Fort, after the Chapel Bell had rung about Noon, one of the <HI>Indians,</HI> by their Leader's Order, fired with Swan Shot upon them while they were near to each other. It is a con&s;tant Rule among the&s;e &s;culking Parties, never to fire without Orders from their Leader. One of the <HI>French</HI> Men was killed upon the Spot, the other wounded and fled immediately towards the Fort Gate, the <HI>Indian</HI> who had fired, pur&s;u'd, and with his Hatchet brought him down within a hundred Steps of the Fort Gate; and, tho' the <HI>French</HI> in the Fort ru&s;hed out at the Gate, he took his Scalp off; the others had &s;calped the Man that was fir&s;t killed, and then they all fled. The <HI>French</HI> in their Hurry had run out without their Arms, and upon recollecting them&s;elves return'd to Arm, which facilitated the E&s;cape of the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>His Excellency being informed, that the Leader of this Party was de&s;irous to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by his Excellency's giving him a new Name, and that the Name &mdash;, which in the Language of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> &s;ignifies the <HI>Path-opener,</HI> would be mo&s;t acceptable to him; his Excellency honour'd him with that Title; which he accepted very thankfully, and &s;eem'd exceedingly plea&s;ed with it: Whereupon he &s;aid, that the other two <HI>Indians</HI> having a&s;&s;ociated with a <HI>Mehikander,</HI> or River <HI>Indian,</HI> were re&s;olved to go out again&s;t the Enemy: But as he thought he might be more u&s;eful by &s;taying, to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the en&s;uing Treaty, he was re&s;olved to remain here. He added, that in Ca&s;e the Interpreter, and others &s;ent to invite the <HI>Six Nations</HI> to meet here, fail'd in any Part, he would go among the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and doubted not to bring many by his Influence, who otherwi&s;e might &s;tay.</P>
<P>In a Day or too after, &s;ix of &s;even <HI>Indians,</HI> who had been &s;ent out by the Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs to <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> to take Pri&s;oners and gain Intelligence, returned and &s;aid, That they had gone to that Place, and that in Sight of it they had &s;eparated, with De&s;ign thereby to &s;urprize any Stragler that might have come out of the Fort: That while they were thus &s;eparated, two of their Number were &s;uddenly &s;urrounded and taken by the Enemy: One of the&s;e two, after having been detained three or four Days, join'd the others at <HI>Saraghtoga.</HI> He &s;aid, that he had been threatned with Death by the <HI>Adirondax</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>a</HI>) A Nation of <HI>Indians</HI> living in <HI>Canada,</HI> who have always been firm Friends to the <HI>French,</HI> and formerly were at War with the <HI>Six Nations.</HI></NOTE>; but that the <HI>Cahnuagas</HI>

<PB N="5" REF="005791_0004_1026EEA82C66CE58">
Interce&s;&s;ion he was &s;et at Liberty; and &s;ome of the <HI>Cahnuagas</HI> conducted him through <HI>Lac Sacrement.</HI> He reported, that there was a great Number of Men, <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> at <HI>Crown-Point.</HI> The other Pri&s;oner, an <HI>Onondaga,</HI> con&s;ented to remain with the <HI>French,</HI> and was &s;ent to <HI>Canada.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after this, &s;ixteen <HI>Mohawk</HI> Indians came to the Town, who had been &s;ent out, from the lower <HI>Mohawk</HI> Ca&s;tle by Mr. <HI>John&s;on,</HI> to gain Intelligence near <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> and to take Pri&s;oners. They reported, that they had di&s;covered &s;o great a Number of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> that they had no Hopes of being able to bring off any Pri&s;oners, and thought it advi&s;eable to return &s;peedily and inform of the great Danger they thought this Place was in. His Excellency invited them to go thither again, in order to de&s;cry the Motions of the Enemy: And as a farther Encouragement to them, to either Scalp or take Pri&s;oners, he offered every Per&s;on of &s;aid Party that &s;hould take a Scalp or Pri&s;oner, a Piece of Stroud, and a Suit of laced Cloaths, be&s;ides the Bounty; but they, being frightned with the Apprehen&s;ions of Danger, declined going back, and &s;aid, they mu&s;t return Home and acquaint their Friends and Relations with what they had heard and &s;een. Several other <HI>Indians</HI> likewi&s;e alarmed the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> by telling them that the <HI>French</HI> had a great Force at <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> and that they would certainly attack either <HI>Albany</HI> or <HI>Schenectade,</HI> or the Settlements on the <HI>Mohawks</HI> River, or perhaps &s;everal Places at the &s;ame Time.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>John&s;on,</HI> and the commanding Officer of the Garri&s;on of regular Troops in the <HI>Mohawks</HI> Country, by their Letters to his Excellency, confirm'd the&s;e Reports; and added, the <HI>Mohawks</HI> had entertain'd Apprehen&s;ions of the <HI>French</HI> Force at <HI>Crown Point,</HI> which was like to have a bad Effect. On this his Excellency wrote to Mr. <HI>John&s;on,</HI> that all the&s;e Stories of the <HI>French</HI> Force at <HI>Crown Point,</HI> were only Artifices of the <HI>French</HI> to intimidate the <HI>Indians,</HI> or to amu&s;e them, with De&s;ign to fru&s;trate the Treaty which he intended to have with them; and that he was to a&s;&s;ure the <HI>Indians,</HI> that they could be in no Danger from the <HI>French</HI>: However, that they might &s;ee that he would omit nothing which they think nece&s;&s;ary for their Security, he had ordered a Lieutenant of Militia with Thirty Men to reinforce the lower Ca&s;tle, and had likewi&s;e ordered the Captain of Militia near the upper Ca&s;tle, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Indians</HI> there in fortifying their Ca&s;tle, and to hold him&s;elf in Readine&s;s to &s;upport them on any Emergency.</P>
<P>One <HI>John Colan</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Man, who &s;ome Years &s;ince had removed from <HI>Canada,</HI> and &s;ettled and married at <HI>Schenectade,</HI> and who has &s;ince that Time lived in good Reputation there, was &s;ent by Major <HI>Glen,</HI> to inform his Excellency, that one <HI>Aaron,</HI> a noted <HI>Mohawk</HI> Sachem, who with &s;everal others of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> had been la&s;t Spring in <HI>Canada</HI> to treat with the Governor there, did then entertain two <HI>Cahnuaga</HI> Indians. This Man, <HI>John Colan,</HI> acquainted his Excellency, that having di&s;covered the <HI>Cahnuaga</HI> Indians, he told them he was a <HI>French</HI> Man, and was de&s;irous of returning to his own Country, on which they began pre&s;ently to propo&s;e to him Methods for his E&s;cape; at which Time, this <HI>Aaron</HI> coming near them, he expre&s;s'd his Fears of being di&s;covered by him. They an&s;wered, that he need not fear <HI>Aaron,</HI> for he was their Friend, and de&s;igned to go with them. As they propo&s;ed to him to e&s;cape privately by him&s;elf, and to meet them at a Place they named, he told them of his Fears, in that Ca&s;e, of meeting with the <HI>French</HI> Indians while he was alone. They an&s;wered, that if he dre&s;s'd him&s;elf like an <HI>Indian,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Indians would do him no Hurt, without fir&s;t 
<PB N="6" REF="005791_0005_1026EEA9F21C2BB8">
calling to him; upon which, if he &s;topp'd and call'd out <HI>Maria,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Indians would be &s;o far from hurting him, that they would immediately come up to him and take him by the Hand. From this, and &s;everal other Incidents, which it would be tedious to relate, his Excellency was convinced of &s;ome &s;ecret Under&s;tanding between the <HI>Six Nations</HI> and the <HI>Cahnuagas,</HI> or <HI>French</HI> Indians: And that, however any Party of our <HI>Indians</HI> might be induced to fall upon the <HI>French,</HI> they would not at that Time mole&s;t the <HI>French</HI> Indians, nor prevent the Mi&s;chiefs which the Inhabitants received from their &s;eulking Parties.</P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on, his Excellency endeavoured to &s;end out again the Company of Rangers, which had formerly been employed again&s;t the &s;culking <HI>Indians</HI>: But, as the A&s;&s;embly had made no Provi&s;ion for this Expence, they refu&s;ed to go, unle&s;s he gave his per&s;onal Bond for their Pay, at <HI>Three Shillings</HI> a Day for each private Man, be&s;ides their Provi&s;ion; and would not be &s;atisfied with the Promi&s;es that he, by the Advice of Council, made them of recommending their Service to the General A&s;&s;embly, and the A&s;&s;urances he gave them of their being rewarded as they de&s;ired.</P>
<P>On their continuing ob&s;tinate, his Excellency was of Opinion, that no con&s;iderable Service could be expected from Men, who were moved by no other Principle but that of exce&s;&s;ive Wages: And he had Rea&s;on afterwards to be confirmed in this Opinion, when Capt. <HI>Langdon,</HI> and afterwards Capt. <HI>Thebout,</HI> voluntarily went with their Companies of the new levied Troops to &s;cour the Woods, and took &s;ome of the&s;e <HI>Albany</HI> Men with them as Guides, who whenever they apprehended them&s;elves in Danger, by the Di&s;covery of recent Tracts, &s;ome one or other of them could not be kept from firing their Guns, or making &s;ome Noi&s;e, by which the <HI>French</HI> Indians, if any were near them, mu&s;t know how to avoid them. Some <HI>Indians,</HI> who were likewi&s;e &s;ent out in Company with the&s;e Men, complained in like Manner.</P>
<P>The publick Interpreter, whom the Governor (as before ob&s;erved) had &s;ent with others, to invite the <HI>Six Nations</HI> to meet him at <HI>Albany,</HI> wrote to the Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs, That they met with great Di&s;&s;iculties and Ob&s;tructions from the <HI>Sachems,</HI> who had been lately at <HI>Canada</HI>: That the <HI>Oneydoes</HI> refu&s;ed to give any An&s;wer, tho' they had &s;tayed there thirteen Days endeavouring to per&s;uade them; and that the <HI>Cayugas</HI> had ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to meet the Governor. On which his Excellency de&s;ired to be informed by the Commi&s;&s;ioners of <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs, whether they knew of any Per&s;on of Influence or Intere&s;t with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and fit to be &s;ent among them on this Occa&s;ion. They an&s;wered, that they knew of none; and that the <HI>Indians</HI> were in a very bad Di&s;po&s;ition, and much under the Influence of the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>About this time his Excellency being informed, that the Interpreter, and others &s;ent with him, had neglected to &s;end proper Invitations to the <HI>Indians</HI> living on the Branches of <HI>Su&s;quehannah</HI> River; and that Capt. <HI>Vroman,</HI> of <HI>Scohary,</HI> was a proper Per&s;on to be &s;ent to tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI>; he &s;ent him, in Company with Capt. <HI>Staats,</HI> with a Belt of <HI>Wampum</HI> to invite them.</P>
<P>While the <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs appear'd in this di&s;couraging State, an Account came to Town, that about Twenty young <HI>Chicka&s;aws</HI> were come to the <HI>Senekas,</HI> to de&s;ire them to &s;hew them the Way to <HI>Canada.</HI> The <HI>Chicke&s;aws</HI> had always been Enemies to the <HI>French</HI>: A Party of about Five Hundred Men had four Years &s;ince been &s;ent out again&s;t them from <HI>Canada,</HI> who were &s;o entirely routed by the <HI>Chicke&s;aws</HI> that few returned. The&s;e young 
<PB N="7" REF="005791_0006_1026EEAC5AE19398">
<HI>Chicke&s;aws</HI> told the <HI>Senekas,</HI> that the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Canada</HI> had about four Years &s;ince made them a Vi&s;it, and were &s;o kind to leave them four Hundred Guns, which were now wore out; and, &s;ince the <HI>French</HI> had not thought fit to bring them any more Guns, they were re&s;olved to go to <HI>Canada</HI> to fetch new Ones; and promi&s;ed, that if the <HI>Senekas</HI> would &s;hew them the Way, they would go Home and return with four Hundred &s;tout Fellows. Some other <HI>Indian</HI> Nations who lived to the We&s;tward, di&s;covering their Aver&s;ion to the <HI>French</HI> at the &s;ame Time, the&s;e Incidents a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Governor's Me&s;&s;engers in bringing more <HI>Indians</HI> to <HI>Albany</HI> than they expected, when they wrote to the Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs.</P>
<P>While the Interpreter was at the more di&s;tant <HI>Indian</HI> Ca&s;tles, Mr. <HI>William John&s;on</HI> was indefatigable among the <HI>Mohawks</HI>; he dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf after the <HI>Indian</HI> Manner, made frequent Dances, according to their Cu&s;tom when they excite to War, and u&s;ed all the Means he could think of, at a con&s;iderable Expence, (which his Excellency had promi&s;ed to repay him) in order to engage them heartily in the War again&s;t <HI>Canada.</HI> Tho' he &s;ucceeded, beyond what any Man in <HI>Albany</HI> thought could be done, yet &s;everal of the <HI>Sachems</HI> (in the <HI>Conajo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ary,</HI> or upper <HI>Mohawk</HI> Ca&s;tle, chiefly) refu&s;ed to engage in the War; but in&s;i&s;ted, that as this War was entred into between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> in which they had no Intere&s;t, they ought to remain Neuter. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> they &s;aid, could at any Time make Peace; but if they &s;hould enter into the War, <HI>Indians</HI> could not make up the Quarrel among them&s;elves, otherwi&s;e than by the De&s;truction of one or the other. The <HI>French</HI> could have no Hopes of engaging the <HI>Six Nations</HI> on their Side again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and therefore wi&s;ely play'd this Game of endeavouring to make them &s;tand Neuter, which they could enforce by &s;trong political Arguments, of which the <HI>Indians</HI> were &s;en&s;ible enough. <HI>It is your Intere&s;t,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Emi&s;&s;aries &s;aid, <HI>not to &s;uffer either the</HI> French <HI>or the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>to be ab&s;olute Ma&s;ters; for in that Ca&s;e you mu&s;t become Slaves to the one or the other.</HI> From this politic View chiefly, the Interpreter met with &s;o much Oppo&s;ition every where: Tho' it is not to be doubted, but that at the &s;ame Time, the <HI>French</HI> had gain'd &s;ome particular <HI>Sachems</HI> entirely into their Intere&s;t; however many were prevailed on to come to <HI>Albany,</HI> to hear what the Governor of <HI>New-York</HI> had to &s;ay to them; tho' &s;everal Sachems &s;taid behind. When they of the more di&s;tant Nations came along with the Interpreter to the lower <HI>Mohawk</HI> Ca&s;tle, and found that Mr. <HI>John&s;on</HI> had already engaged many of the young Men there to join the Army again&s;t <HI>Canada,</HI> the others blamed the <HI>Mohawks</HI>; telling them with &s;ome Warmth, That they had been very ra&s;h in engaging &s;o far. <Q>They ought, <HI>the others &s;aid,</HI> to have con&s;idered that they, the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> were the &s;malle&s;t in Number of any of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and ought not to have proceeded to &s;o great a Length, without the previous Con&s;ent of the others.</Q> To this the <HI>Mohawks</HI> an&s;wered, <HI>It is true, we are le&s;s con&s;iderable as to Number, than any of the other Nations; but our Hearts are truly</HI> Engli&s;h, <HI>and all of us are Men</HI> <NOTE PLACE="foot">(a) The <HI>Six Nations</HI> reckon all other Indian Nations, Women, in compari&s;on to them&s;elves.</NOTE>; <HI>&s;o that, if our Force be put to the Trial, perhaps it will be found greater than you imagine.</HI> The&s;e Di&s;putes, however, continued &s;o far, that the <HI>Mohawks</HI> and the other <HI>Five Nations,</HI> could not go in Company to <HI>Albany</HI>; the <HI>Mohawks</HI> marched on one &s;ide of the River, while the other Nations went on the other Side. [<HI>There are two Roads from the</HI> Mohawks <HI>Ca&s;tle to</HI> Schenectada, <HI>one on each Side of the</HI> Mohawks <HI>River.</HI>]</P>

When the <HI>Indians</HI> came near the Town of <HI>Albany,</HI> on the 8<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> Mr. <HI>John&s;on</HI> put him&s;elf at the Head of the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> dre&s;&s;ed and painted after the Manner of an <HI>Indian</HI> War Captain; and the <HI>Indians</HI> who followed him, were likewi&s;e dre&s;&s;ed and painted, as is u&s;ual with them when they &s;et out in War.

<P>As, by all Accounts, the Di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> &s;eemed at this Time le&s;s in Favour of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t than was to be wi&s;hed; his Excellency thought it nece&s;&s;ary to have frequent Conferences, in private, with the principal Sachems of each <HI>Nation</HI>; &s;ometimes &s;eparately and &s;ingly, at other Times with &s;ome of each Nation jointly. There were only two of the <HI>Mohawk</HI> Sachems (be&s;ides <HI>Aaron</HI> before mentioned, who left the Ca&s;tle at this Time) that could not be prevailed on by Mr. <HI>John&s;on,</HI> to declare them&s;elves for entering into the War again&s;t <HI>Canada</HI>: They were both of the <HI>Conajo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ary</HI> or Upper-Ca&s;tle, and one of them the Head of the Tribe called the <HI>Tortoi&s;e</HI>; (which, tho' not &s;o numerous as that of the <HI>Bear,</HI> yet is looked on as the Fir&s;t in Rank or Dignity;) and, as he had been with the Governor of <HI>Canada</HI> la&s;t Spring, it was thought to be of &s;ome Con&s;equence to gain him. Mr <HI>Colden,</HI> above Twenty Years &s;ince, had the Complement of being received into that Ca&s;tle; and, about Seven Years &s;ince (the la&s;t Time he had been with the <HI>Mohawks</HI>) had contracted &s;ome more particular Acquaintance with the&s;e two Sachems: He invited them to a private Conference, at which the Reverend Mr. <HI>Barclay</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted as Interpreter; they met him, and brought five more with them: After this Conference the&s;e Sachems appear'd as hearty as any of the others. He that was Head of the Tribe call'd the <HI>Tortoi&s;e,</HI> &s;aid, <Q>His Uncle had been the chief War Captain among the <HI>Mohawks</HI>: That his Uncle had particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in their Wars again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> and he was re&s;olved to &s;hew him&s;elf not unworthy of his Ance&s;tors, nor of his Uncle's Name, which he had obtained after his Death.</Q></P>
<P>After the principal Sachems had, at the&s;e Conferences, been brought to a good Di&s;po&s;ition, his Excellency, advi&s;ed with the Gentlemen of the Council, and the Commi&s;&s;ioners from the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Bay,</HI> on what may be proper to be &s;aid to the <HI>Six Nations</HI> in the Publick Speech, which he now propo&s;ed to make to them. Col. <HI>Wendell</HI> and Mr. <HI>Wells</HI> had arrived from <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> about the End of <HI>July,</HI> and &s;oon after they came to Town, his Excellency ordered the Gentlemen of the Council to communicate to them all the Information which had been received, with re&s;pect to the <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs: And they had frequent Conferences together from Time to Time, as Occa&s;ion required: It was likewi&s;e thought proper to communicate, what his Excellency intended to &s;ay to &s;ome of the Sachems of each Nation, who were thought mo&s;t hearty in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t; who &s;aid, that it was well conceiv'd as could have been done, had they them&s;elves advi&s;ed upon the Subject; only as it had been advi&s;ed to ob&s;erve in the fir&s;t Draught, That &s;ome of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects had been in&s;tigated by the <HI>French</HI> to ri&s;e in Rebellion again&s;t the King; that they had been defeated by one of the King's Sons; that the&s;e poor People were now utterly ruined, and had nothing left but to bewail their Folly in the Mi&s;ery that was brought upon them, by &s;uffering them&s;elves to be deluded by the fair Promi&s;es of the <HI>French</HI>; they &s;aid, that 
<PB N="9" REF="005791_0008_1026EEB1B118D518">
they did not under&s;tand the Affairs on the other Side of the Sea, nor did they trouble their Heads about them; and as they had no Method of retaining what is &s;poke to them but by their Memories, they were afraid that this might perplex their Memories, and make them le&s;s attentive to what is properly their Bu&s;ine&s;s; and advi&s;ed, that it &s;hould be left out; which accordingly was done.</P>
<P>Another Difficulty remained; the publick Interpreter had been taken dangerou&s;ly ill in his Return to <HI>Albany,</HI> and was at this Time confined to his Bed. Tho' &s;everal were employed, who had Knowledge &s;ufficient in the Language of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> to make them&s;elves be under&s;tood, and to under&s;tand what was &s;poke to them; yet none of them were &s;o much Ma&s;ters of the Language, as to &s;peak with that Propriety and Di&s;tinctne&s;s that is expected, and u&s;ual on &s;o &s;olemn an Occa&s;ion. It was thought therefore proper, to make one of the Sachems under&s;tand the Speech, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the common Interpreters, that he might be able to deliver it Paragraph by Paragraph, as it &s;hould be &s;poke. At fir&s;t a <HI>Mohawk</HI> Sachem was pitched upon; but the Sachems them&s;elves told us, That for &s;ome time pa&s;t a kind of Party-Divi&s;ion among the <HI>Six Nations</HI> had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted: That the <HI>Mohawks, Onandagas</HI> and <HI>Senekas,</HI> form'd one Party; and the <HI>Oneydoes, Tu&s;caroras</HI> and <HI>Cayugas,</HI> the other: That, as the <HI>Mohawks</HI> might be &s;u&s;pected to be more partial to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> it would be of more U&s;e to employ one of the other Party; and an <HI>Oneydo</HI> Sachem was propo&s;ed for that Purpo&s;e. This Man was ea&s;ily enough made to under&s;tand the Speech, and he repeated it &s;everal Times over in private, and was in&s;tructed where to make the proper Stops. After the Speech was delivered, &s;ome of the Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs, and other Per&s;ons pre&s;ent at the Delivery, who under&s;tood both Languages, acknowledged, that this <HI>Indian</HI> had acquitted him&s;elf of his Tru&s;t faithfully, and had delivered the Sen&s;e of the Speech clearly and di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P>While the&s;e la&s;t Preparations were making, his Excellency was taken ill of a Fever, which occa&s;ioned &s;ome further Delay; and as his Excellency did not recover &s;o &s;oon as was wi&s;hed, the Sachems were told, that his Excellency being unwilling to detain them witho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Nece&s;&s;ity, would, if they de&s;ired it, direct Mr. <HI>Colden</HI> to &s;peak to them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is Name, what he de&s;igned to &s;ay. They an&s;wered, that they would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> plea&s;ed to hear it from Mr. <HI>Colden</HI>'s Mouth.</P>

<P>HIS Excellency our Governor having been taken ill, and as yet not &s;o well recovered as that he can &s;afely come abroad; has ordered me (being the next Per&s;on to him in the Admini&s;tration) to &s;peak to you in his Name, which I &s;hall do in the &s;ame Words which he de&s;igned to have &s;poke, had he not been prevented by Sickne&s;s.</P>
<Q><PB N="10" REF="005791_0009_1026EEB399AA2CD8">
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I AM glad &s;o &s;ee &s;o many of our ancient Friends here, and heartily bid you Wellcome. <STAGE>[Gave three Strings of Wampum.]</STAGE></P>
<P>I have call'd you to this Place for two great Ends; in which the Province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets-Bay</HI> have &s;ent Commi&s;&s;ioners to concur with me; who are here pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> is, to renew the Covenant Chain with you; and I now by this Belt, in your Father the King of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>'s Name, in Behalf of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects in <HI>North-America,</HI> renew and confirm the Covenant Chain, and all former Treaties and Engagements entered into with you. This Chain has from the Beginning, remained &s;o firm and &s;trong, that it has never once broke or &s;lipt &s;ince it was fir&s;t made; and we, on our Parts, &s;hall endeavour that it remain &s;o, un&s;haken, as long as the Sun and Moon &s;hall endure. <STAGE>[Gave a Belt.]</STAGE></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> La&s;t Fall I told you, that his Maje&s;ty's Subjects in this Country had, the Summer before, lain &s;till, without attempting any thing again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> Settlements: But that the <HI>French</HI> had by Surprize, attacked and de&s;troyed a &s;mall Place near <HI>Cape-Breton,</HI> belonging to us.</P>
<P>That they afterwards laid Siege to <HI>Annapolis-Royal,</HI> and were beat off.</P>
<P>I likewi&s;e told you, That the Governor of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets-Bay,</HI> in Conjunction with <HI>Connecticut</HI> and <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI>; had, in Revenge to the&s;e Injuries, &s;ent an Army again&s;t <HI>Loui&s;burg,</HI> on the I&s;land of <HI>Cape-Breton</HI>; that the Army was joined by a Number of his Maje&s;ty's Ships of War, under the Command of your Friend Admiral <HI>Warren.</HI></P>
<P>I told you, that the Town of <HI>Loui&s;burg,</HI> which is the Stronge&s;t the <HI>French</HI> have in <HI>America,</HI> was reduced by this Force; and that the <HI>French</HI> there, had &s;urrendered them&s;elves and their Country to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>I likewi&s;e told you, how we in this Part of the Country, had lain &s;till; hoping that the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>Canada,</HI> would either be quiet, or carry on the War in a manly Manner, and after the Manner of Chri&s;tians. And to induce them thereto, a Me&s;&s;age had been &s;ent from this Place to the Governor of <HI>Canada,</HI> to tell him, That if he &s;hould revive the inhuman Cu&s;tom of murdering private People, by &s;culking <HI>Indians,</HI> that the &s;everal Governors of his Maje&s;ty's Colonies, together with you our Brethren of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> would join and make Repri&s;als on them in the like Manner; at which time you publickly declared, that if any of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects, in any Part of his Governments, &s;hould be killed by any <HI>Indians</HI>; you would immediately join in the War again&s;t them, and the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>And la&s;t Fall, when I delivered the Hatchet into your Hands, you told me, and confirm'd it with a Belt, That you would &s;end &s;ome of your People (who were then ready) to <HI>Canada,</HI> to demand Satisfaction; and that if Satisfaction was refu&s;ed, you would u&s;e the Hatchet again&s;t them, whenever I &s;hould order it.</P>
<P>And you further promi&s;ed, That if the Enemy &s;hould commit any further Ho&s;tilities, you would then (upon my Commands) immediately make U&s;e of the Hatchet.</P>
<P>I need not tell you, how far the <HI>French</HI> have been from giving Satisfaction; on the Contrary, you are well acquainted with the cruel and barbarous Murders that have been committed, &s;ince that Time, by the <HI>French Indians</HI> at <HI>Saraghtoga,</HI> and in the Neighbourhoods of this Place, and on the Frontiers of <HI>New-England</HI>; as you have not hitherto fulfilled your 
<PB N="11" REF="005791_0010_1026EEB61D679E50">
Promi&s;es, I &s;u&s;pect that they did not come from your Hearts: I therefore, by this Belt, demand an immediate Performance of your Promi&s;es, to &s;hew that they come from the Bottom of your Hearts; as all the Promi&s;es I make come from mine, and ever &s;hall. <STAGE>[Gave a Belt.]</STAGE></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> I now come to the <HI>Second</HI> and principal De&s;ign of our pre&s;ent Meeting, in which I hope and expect to find you hearty, and united in your Councils and Opinions. <STAGE>[Gave a Belt.]</STAGE></P>
<P>The King your Father, having been informed of the unmanly Murders committed on the Frontiers of <HI>New-England,</HI> and of this Province; is re&s;olved to &s;ubdue the Country of <HI>Canada,</HI> and thereby put an End to all the mi&s;chievous De&s;igns of the <HI>French</HI> in the&s;e Parts. And for this Purpo&s;e, he has ordered his Governors of <HI>Virginia, Maryland, Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> to join their Forces to the Forces of this Province, to attack <HI>Canada</HI> by Land: They are all now upon their March, and you will &s;oon &s;ee them here.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame Time the Forces of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets-Bay, Connecticut, Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> and <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> are to go in Ships to <HI>Cape-Breton,</HI> and there join with his Maje&s;ty's Ships of War, and a great Army of experienc'd Soldiers from <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Many Ships of War are already arrived there, and &s;ome Thou&s;and of Soldiers; many more Ships and Soldiers are following; and I expect every Hour to hear of their Arrival; after which the Attack upon <HI>Canada</HI> will be made an all Sides, both by Sea and Land.</P>
<P>You may perceive the King has ordered a Strength &s;ufficient to &s;ubdue <HI>Canada</HI>; but at the &s;ame Time, the King your Father expects and orders you his Children, to join with your whole Force in this Enterprize; and thereby gives the <HI>Six Nations</HI> a glorious Opportunity of e&s;tabli&s;hing their Fame and Renown over all the <HI>Indian</HI> Nations in <HI>America,</HI> in the Conque&s;t of your inveterate Enemies the <HI>French</HI>; who, however they may di&s;&s;emble and profe&s;s Friend&s;hip, can never forget the Slaughter which your Fathers made of them; and for that Purpo&s;e, care&s;s tho&s;e Nations who have always been your inveterate Enemies, and who de&s;ire nothing &s;o much as to &s;ee the Name of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> become obliterate, and forgot for ever. <STAGE>[Gave a Belt.]</STAGE></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> The <HI>French,</HI> on all Occa&s;ions, &s;hew, that they act again&s;t your Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> like Men that know they dare not look them in the Face in Day-Light; and therefore, like Thieves, &s;teal upon poor People, who do not expect them in the Night, and con&s;equently are not prepared for them: Your Brethren in their Revenge, have acted like Men of Courage; they do not attack poor Farmers at their Labour, but boldly attempted the Reduction of <HI>Loui&s;burg,</HI> the &s;tronge&s;t Town the <HI>French</HI> had in <HI>America</HI>; in the Fortifying of which they had &s;pent above Twenty Years: It was &s;urrounded with &s;trong Walls and Forts, in which they had planted their large&s;t Cannon in every Place, where they thought the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> could come near them; notwith&s;tanding of all the&s;e Precautions and Advantages, they were forced to &s;ubmit to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Valour.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t have heard from your Fathers, and I doubt not &s;everal of your old Men &s;till remember, what the <HI>French</HI> did at <HI>Onondaga</HI>; how they &s;urprized your Country-Men at <HI>Cadarackui</HI>; how they invaded the <HI>Senekas,</HI> and what Mi&s;chiefs they did to the <HI>Mohawks</HI>; how many of 
<PB N="12" REF="005791_0011_1026EEBA765D01E8">
your Country-Men &s;uffered by the Fire at <HI>Montreal.</HI> Before they entered upon the&s;e cruel and mi&s;chievous De&s;igns, they &s;ent Prie&s;ts among you to delude you, and lull you a Sleep, while they were preparing to knock you in the Head; and I hear they are attempting to do the &s;ame now. <STAGE>[Gave a Belt.]</STAGE></P>
<P>I need not put you in Mind what Revenge your Fathers took for the&s;e Injuries, when they put all the I&s;land of <HI>Montreal,</HI> and a great Part of <HI>Canada,</HI> to Fire and Sword; can you think that the <HI>French</HI> forget this? No, they have the Ax privately in their Hands again&s;t you, and u&s;e the&s;e deceitful Arts, by which only they have been able to gain Advantage over you, that by your tru&s;ting to them, they may at &s;ome time or other, at one Blow, remove from the Face of the Earth, the Remembrance of a People that have &s;o often put them to Shame and Flight.</P>
<P>If your Fathers could now ri&s;e out of their Graves, how would their Hearts leap with Joy to &s;ee this Day; when &s;o glorious an Opportunity is put into their Hands to revenge all the Injuries their Country has received from the <HI>French,</HI> and be never more expo&s;ed to their Treachery and Deceit. I make no doubt you are the true Sons of &s;uch renowned and brave Ance&s;tors, animated with the &s;ame Spirit for your Country's Glory, and in Revenge of the Injuries your Fathers received, uncapable of being deluded by the flattering Speeches of them, who always have been, and always mu&s;t be, in their Hearts, your Enemies, and who de&s;ire nothing more, than the De&s;truction of your Nations.</P>
<P>I therefore invite you, <HI>Brethren,</HI> by this Belt, to join with us, and to &s;hare with us, in the Honour of the Conque&s;t of our, and your deceitful Enemies; and that you not only join all the Force of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> with us, but likewi&s;e invite all the Nations depending on you, to take a Share in this glorious Enterprize: And I will furni&s;h your fighting Men with Arms, Ammunition, Cloathing, Provi&s;ions, and every Thing nece&s;&s;ary for the War; and in their Ab&s;ence, take Care of their Wives and Children. <STAGE>[Gave the War Belt.]</STAGE></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> You have &s;een how daring and in&s;ulting on you, as well as us, the <HI>French</HI> Indians have been, in cruelly murdering &s;everal of our People &s;ince you have come to this Place; and therefore, for the many Rea&s;ons now laid before you, I make no doubt but your An&s;wer will clearly manife&s;t your Duty to the King your Father, and your Love to your Brethren; and by this Belt I do a&s;&s;ure you, that our Intent is, to live and die together. <STAGE>[Gave a Belt of Friend&s;hip.]</STAGE></P></Q>
<P>At every Stop where a Belt was given, one of the Sachems call'd out <HI>Yo-hay,</HI> to which all the re&s;t an&s;wered in a Sound which cannot be expre&s;&s;ed in our Letters, but &s;eem'd to con&s;i&s;t of two Words remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed in the Cadence; it &s;eem'd to this purpo&s;e, <HI>Do you hear?</HI> the Sachem calls: The An&s;wer is, We attend and remember, or under&s;tand; or it is a Kind of Applaudit our Interpreters could not explain. And at the Clo&s;e of the Speech, one Sachem of each Nation calls out &s;everally the <HI>Yo-hay,</HI> to which the others of the &s;ame Nation an&s;wer &s;everally: But when the War-Belt was thrown down, they gave the War-Shout. We expected but Six of the&s;e Applaudits, according to the Number of the <HI>Six Nations</HI>; but eight were di&s;tinctly delivered, by which we under&s;tood &s;ome other Nations were united with them on this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="005791_0012_1026EEBC18642BD0">
After the Speech was delivered, the Sachems of the &s;everal Nations had Conferences together; and &s;ome time being &s;pent in deliberating, they acquainted his Excellency, <Q>That they had agreed upon their An&s;wer, which they were ready to give whenever he would appoint a Time to receive it;</Q> and he named the next Day.</P>
<P>Accordingly on the 23<HI>d</HI> of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> His EXCELLENCY being pre&s;ent; the Gentlemen of the Council; the Commi&s;&s;ioners from <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>; the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs; the Corporation of <HI>Albany</HI>; and many Gentlemen, as at the Time when his Excellency's Speech was delivered,</P>

<P><HI>WE the</HI> Six Nations <HI>are now a&s;&s;embled together as one Man, and we take in the</HI> Me&s;&s;e&s;agues <HI>for the Seventh Nation; and what is now to be &s;poken by one Mouth, are the joint and &s;incere Thoughts of every Heart.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We are pleas'd that you follow the Steps of our Fore-Fathers, in wiping off the &s;orrowful Tears from our Eyes, by which the Sotppage of our Throats are opened, and the bloody Bed wa&s;h'd clean.</HI> <STAGE>[Gave three Strings of Wampum.]</STAGE></P>
<P>Brethren, <HI>The fir&s;t Time we met together, we only &s;aluted each other by &s;haking of Hands; we afterwards made a Covenant Chain of Silver, which we mutualiy have held fa&s;t to this Day; &s;hould it now &s;lip from either of our Hands, it would prove De&s;truction to both Sides, &s;ince our Enemies have drawn the Sword.</HI> <STAGE>[Gave a Belt.]</STAGE></P>
<P>Brother of <HI>New-York; La&s;t Year you gave us the Hatchet to be made U&s;e of again&s;t your Enemies, (the</HI> French, <HI>which we accepted) and promi&s;ed to make u&s;e of it if they &s;hould commit any farther Ho&s;tilities upon the</HI> Engli&s;h, <HI>which they have now done by de&s;troying</HI> S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">aghtoga, <HI>and &s;hedding a great deal of Blood: Hitherto we have made no u&s;e of the Hatchet; but as you now call upon us, we are ready, and do declare from the Bottom of our Hearts, that we will from this Day, make u&s;e of it again&s;t the</HI> French, <HI>and their Children,</HI> (meaning their <HI>Indians.</HI>)</P></Q>

<P>[At the End of the foregoing Paragraph, the Speaker threw down a War-Belt of Wampum on the Ground, it being the <HI>Indian</HI> Cu&s;tom to deliver War-Belts, or make Declaration of War in this Manner: This he did with a remarkable Shew of Indignation, intending thereby to expre&s;s their Re&s;entment again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> and their Allies, and their Zeal for the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI>] <STAGE>[Gave a Belt.]</STAGE></P>

<Q><P><HI>As to your Su&s;picions of our admitting</HI> French <HI>Prie&s;ts among us, they are become groundle&s;s, &s;ince we have now declared War again&s;t them: The admitting of Prie&s;ts, would only tend to lull us a&s;leep to our De&s;truction; &s;hould any now dare to come, we know no U&s;e for them but to roa&s;t them. The Thoughts of the Treatment we formerly received from the</HI> French, <HI>thro' the Means of their Prie&s;ts, and which you now &s;ea&s;onably have brought to our Remembrance, makes our Blood to boil.</HI></P>
<P>Brother of <HI>New-York; This is the &s;econd Time you have put the Hatchet into our Hands, which we accept, and are ready to go upon Service. You may &s;ee that we have but a Handful of fighting Men here at pre&s;ent; however, &s;ome of them from each Nation &s;hall be left behind us to follow your Orders.</HI></P>
<P><HI>When we return to our re&s;pective Ca&s;tles, we &s;hall &s;end down a great Number of our Warriors, and of tho&s;e of the Nations in Alliance with us, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This we a&s;&s;ure you of from the Truth and Sincerity of our Hearts; and we receive, and &s;hall pre&s;erve this large Belt,</HI> <STAGE>[holding it up at the &s;ame Time]</STAGE> <HI>which you have now given us, as a War-Hatchet.</HI></P>
<P>Brethren, <HI>This is the Belt of Union with which we are to go Hand in Hand to the Gate of our Enemies, and by it we declare our Intention to conquer or dye in the Common Cau&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>There is a Nation call'd the</HI> Me&s;&s;e&s;agues, <HI>who&s;e Delegates are here pre&s;ent: They con&s;i&s;t of five Ca&s;tles, containing Eight Hundred Men, who are all determined and do agree to join us, in this Common Cau&s;e, again&s;t our Enemies the</HI> French, <HI>and their</HI> Indians; <HI>and we hope you, and the Commi&s;&s;ioners from</HI> Bo&s;ton, <HI>will u&s;e them in &s;uch a Manner that they will go home content and &s;atisfied.</HI> <STAGE>[Gave a Belt of Union, in which the Figures of &s;everal Per&s;ons join'd Hand in Hand, was wrought.</STAGE></P></Q>
<P>The Per&s;on who interpreted, returned the <HI>Yo-hay</HI> at the End of every Paragraph, and having done the &s;ame at the time they declared War, it occa&s;ion'd Laughter among them; upon which, ob&s;erving his Mi&s;take, he began the War-Shout, in which all the <HI>Indians</HI> joined.</P>
<P>The <HI>Me&s;&s;e&s;agues</HI> are a Nation of <HI>Indians</HI> living near the Place called <HI>De Troit,</HI> by the <HI>French,</HI> and &s;ituate between Lake <HI>Erie</HI> and the <HI>Huron</HI> Lake.</P>
<P>After the Speaker had fini&s;hed, his Excellency told them by the Interpreter, that the King their Father had ordered him to make them a Pre&s;ent on this Occa&s;ion; and that the Government of <HI>Virginia</HI> had on the &s;ame Occa&s;ion &s;ent them a Pre&s;ent. The Commi&s;&s;ioners from <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> at the &s;ame time told them, that they had a Pre&s;ent from their Government; and as they were &s;oon to return Home, de&s;ired the <HI>Six Nations</HI> to come to their Lodgings to receive it; on which the <HI>Indians</HI> de&s;ired his Excellency to delay his Pre&s;ent to next Day, and they immediately went to receive their Pre&s;ents from the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets-Bay.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="005791_0014_1026EEC0A02B2B20">
The next Day, the Pre&s;ents from the King being expo&s;ed on one Part, and tho&s;e from <HI>Virginia</HI> &s;eparately near them, it was agreed by the People of <HI>Albany,</HI> who had &s;een many publick Pre&s;ents given to the <HI>Six Nations</HI> on Treaties with them, that this was the mo&s;t Valuable ever given. His Excellency on the giving the Pre&s;ents, &s;aid;</P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>YOU here &s;ee a Token of the Regard the King your Father has for you; and there is a Token of the Friend&s;hip of the Government of <HI>Virginia</HI>: But on this Occa&s;ion I cannot forbear taking Notice to you, that &s;ome of your People being at <HI>Canada,</HI> when the News of the Reduction of <HI>Cape-Breton</HI> came there, and when the <HI>French</HI> expected that <HI>Quebec</HI> would be immediately attacked in Con&s;equence of it; &s;everal of them joined with the <HI>French,</HI> and promi&s;ed them A&s;&s;i&s;tance. This occa&s;ion'd &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s to your Brethren, being contrary to the Faith of your Nations, as well as to your Brethren's Expectations; however, you may now, by performing the Promi&s;es you Ye&s;terday made in the mo&s;t &s;olemn Manner, remove all Su&s;picions; and for ever &s;ecure the Friend&s;hip of your Brethren, which hitherto has from the Beginning, remain'd unviolated on their Parts. The Goods now before you, are Pre&s;ents to the <HI>Six Nations</HI>; and, as we have received the <HI>Me&s;&s;e&s;agues</HI> into the Covenant between you and us, I expect that they &s;hall &s;hare with you. Be&s;ides the&s;e general Pre&s;ents now made to your Nations, I have prepared proper Cloathing for your War-Captains, and the Warriors who &s;hall go under their Command; together with Arms, Ammunition and Provi&s;ions, which &s;hall be delivered to the &s;everal Parties at the Time they &s;hall go out on Service.</P></Q>
<P>What his Excellency &s;aid having been interpreted by a <HI>Mohawk</HI> Sachem, the Sachem added of his own Head, <HI>You now &s;ee how you are here treated, really like Brethren; the Governor of</HI> Canada <HI>does not treat his</HI> Indians <HI>&s;o; they are &s;et on like his Dogs, and they run on without Thought or Con&s;ideration: You &s;ee what a noble Pre&s;ent is made to you; if the Governor of</HI> Canada <HI>&s;hould &s;eize all the Goods in that Country, it would not be in his Power to make &s;uch a Pre&s;ent.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Onondaga</HI> Sachem, Speaker of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> immediately replied,</P>
<Q><P>Brethren of <HI>New-York, New-England,</HI> and <HI>Virginia</HI>;</P>
<P><HI>WE heard, and ob&s;erve well, what you now and formerly &s;poke to us; and we beg no mention may hereafter be made of what pa&s;&s;ed la&s;t Fall, &s;ince we are now heartily enter'd into the War with you, and have promi&s;ed as many fighting Men from each Ca&s;tle as can be &s;pared; and likewi&s;e to engage as great Numbers of every Nation in Alliance with us, as we can, to join immediately with us in the War again&s;t the</HI> French, <HI>and the Nations who adhere to them.</HI></P>
<P>Brethren of <HI>New-York, New-England,</HI> and <HI>Virginia,</HI></P>
<P><HI>You mu&s;t not &s;u&s;pect that it proceeds from any Backwardne&s;s in us, that a greater Number of our People do not at this In&s;tant join with you; the Rea&s;on is, our Ca&s;tles have but few fighting Men in them, many are now abroad, &s;ome hunting and trading with far di&s;tant Nations, and others out fighting again&s;t our Enemies; all the&s;e we &s;hall recall home as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, in order to enter with all our Force, into the War again&s;t your and our common Enemy.</HI></P>
<P>Brother, <HI>We have no more to &s;ay at this Time, but only to tell you, we are &s;orry that we can &s;o little &s;hew our Hearts by the Pre&s;ents we now offer; our 
<PB N="16" REF="005791_0015_1026EEC4CD668EA8">
hunting has been &s;o very poor, that we cannot make you Pre&s;ents &s;uitable to our Inclinations.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Mohawks</HI> added &s;eparately: <HI>We have been employed all Summer in your Service as Out-&s;couts, to gain Intelligence, or in &s;ome Manner or other, and thereby kept from hunting: We have no Furrs to offer you, but we here pre&s;ent our Per&s;ons, to &s;erve you wherever you &s;hall command.</HI></P></Q>
<P>That Day was &s;pent in dividing the Pre&s;ents among them&s;elves. We were told, That the&s;e Pre&s;ents were divided into eight equal Parts, of which they gave two to the <HI>Me&s;&s;e&s;ague</HI> Deputies.</P>
<P>The next Day the War-Kettle was &s;et over the Fire, and towards Evening the <HI>Indians</HI> in his Excellency's Pre&s;ence, where many Gentlemen attended him, began the War-Dance, and continued it till late in the Night: They were painted as when they go to War. The Dance is a &s;low and &s;olemn Motion, accompanied with a pathetick Song. The <HI>Indians</HI> in their Turns perform this &s;ingly; but it is not ea&s;y to de&s;cribe the Particularities of it.</P>
<P>His Excellency call'd &s;everal of the chief Sachems who had been u&s;eful in the Treaty, to him in private, and gave them Pre&s;ents &s;everally; neither did he forget the <HI>Me&s;&s;e&s;ague</HI> Deputies: He had a particular Conference with one of them in private, the other was &s;ick of the Small-Pox. At this Conference this Deputy a&s;&s;ur'd his Excellency of the good Inclinations of his Nation to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and their Aver&s;ion to the <HI>French</HI>; he &s;aid, <Q>That many of the Nations to the We&s;tward of them, di&s;liked the <HI>French</HI>;</Q> and as an In&s;tance of it, he told, <Q>That the <HI>French</HI> lately having pre&s;&s;ed a neighbouring Nation to take up the Hatchet again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> they received i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; but made U&s;e of it again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> them&s;elves, and kill'd all the <HI>French</HI> then with them, being Sixty in Number, with the Lo&s;s of only one Man of their own Nation.</Q> His Excellency made him hand&s;om Pre&s;ents, and gave him a Belt to carry to his Nation, with an Invitation to join in the War again&s;t the <HI>French</HI>; the <HI>Me&s;&s;e&s;ague</HI> received them with a Profe&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t &s;incere and hearty Friend&s;hip, and that he made no doubt of bringing two, three, or four Hundred Men of his Nation to &s;erve this Fall again&s;t the <HI>French.</HI> He added, <Q>That he and &s;everal of his Relations would immediately u&s;e their be&s;t Endeavours with &s;everal other Nations to the We&s;tward of them, who were numerous, to join again&s;t the <HI>French</HI>; in which, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> he had great Hopes of Succe&s;s, becau&s;e they were di&s;&s;atisfied with the <HI>French.</HI></Q></P>
<P>His Excellency took all po&s;&s;ible Care of the Sick <HI>Me&s;&s;e&s;ague,</HI> had him brought into a Hou&s;e, and ordered him to be attended by two Phy&s;icians; but the poor M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n had the Misfortune to dye, after he had been above a Fortnight ill. When be found him&s;elf near his End, he &s;ent to the Governor, to de&s;ire him as his la&s;t Reque&s;t, that his Excellency would &s;end the fir&s;t <HI>French</HI> Scalp that &s;hould be taken, to his Mother; and when he was told that his Excellency had promi&s;ed it, he &s;hew'd a Contentedne&s;s and Re&s;ignation to Death. This Misfortune was increa&s;ed by the Death of the other <HI>Me&s;&s;e&s;ague</HI> Deputy likewi&s;e, who was taken ill in his Way home, and died. The <HI>Six Nations</HI> took Care of their Wives and Children, who had come with them; and it was not doubted but that they, and all the Pre&s;ents given them, would be &s;afely conveyed to their own Homes.</P>

Having &s;o far given an Account of what pa&s;&s;ed with the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> it may be proper next to relate the Treaty with the <HI>Mehikanders</HI> or <HI>River Indians, viz.</HI> The &s;everal Tribes of <HI>Indians</HI> living at &s;everal Places on each Side of <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s River.</P>
<P>On his Excellency's Arrival at <HI>Albany,</HI> having found that there had been a Neglect in &s;ending for the <HI>E&s;opus</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;&s;ink</HI> Indians; he &s;ent Orders for them to be invited. The <HI>Mehikanders</HI> being conveened the 21<HI>ft,</HI> His Excellency directed Mr. <HI>Colden</HI> to &s;peak to them in his Name and Words; which Mr. <HI>Colden</HI> did; the other Gentlemen of the Council; the Commi&s;&s;ioners from <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>; the Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs; and &s;everal other Gentlemen being pre&s;ent; in the Words following:</P>
<Q><P><HI>Children,</HI></P>
<P>I AM glad to meet you at this Time, as do likewi&s;e the Commi&s;&s;ioners from the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets-Bay,</HI> who are now come hither to concur with me upon the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion; and I take this Opportunity to renew the ancient Covenant Chain with you, in Behalf of this and all his Maje&s;ty's Governments in <HI>America,</HI> which you know has always been kept bright and clean, without any of the lea&s;t Stain or Ru&s;t; and which by this Belt I &s;trengthen. <STAGE>[Gave a Belt.]</STAGE></P>
<P><HI>Children,</HI> My meeting you here, be&s;ides renewing the Covenant Chain, is with Intention that you &s;hould join your Force with ours, by taking up the Hatchet again&s;t our and your common Enemies the <HI>French,</HI> and their <HI>Indians</HI>; who have in a very unmanly Manner, by &s;culking Parties, murder'd, in cold Blood, many of your Brethren in this and the Province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets-Bay.</HI></P>
<P>This Behaviour lays us under a Nece&s;&s;ity of mking Repri&s;als on them in like Manner, in which I make no doubt of your A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and we are re&s;olved to take a thorough Revenge of our and your perpetual Enemies, by reducing the Country of <HI>Canada,</HI> that it may not be in the Power of the&s;e perfidious, deceitful and cruel People, to do you or us any Injury for the future: For which Purpo&s;e all the neighbouring Colonies, together with many Ships of War and Soldiers from <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> are re&s;olved to unite their Force, and to attack <HI>Canada</HI> in all Parts, both by Sea and Land; and I make no doubt, you will on this Occa&s;ion &s;hew your &s;elves dutiful Children, in joining heartily with us and the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> in this glorious Enterprize; by which you will not only gain Honour and Renown, but al&s;o Safety and Pro&s;perity to your Selves, your Wives, and Children forever afterwards: And for which End I will furni&s;h your fighting Men with Arms, Ammunition, Cloathing, Provi&s;ions, and every Thing nece&s;&s;ary for the War. <STAGE>[Gave a War-Belt.]</STAGE></P></Q>
<P>On the 26<HI>th</HI> they gave their An&s;wer, which was interpreted in the following Words; (The &s;ame Per&s;ons being Pre&s;ent that were when the Governor's Speech was delivered to them.)</P>
<Q><P>Father,</P>
<P>WE are glad to &s;ee you; and we are come to renew the Covenant Chain, and make it fa&s;t and bright as ever, and free from Ru&s;t; and as a Token thereof we given you this Belt. <STAGE>[Gave a Belt.]</STAGE></P>
<P><HI>Father,</HI> You have told us what Mi&s;chief the <HI>French</HI> have done, and what Murders upon the Chri&s;tians they have committed; therefore we declare from 
<PB N="18" REF="005791_0017_1026EEC8EDD02258">
our Hearts, and not from our Lips only, that as you have ordered us to &s;hed the Enemies Blood in Return for what they have done, we are re&s;olved to live and die with you in the Common Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>When you Chri&s;tians are at War, you make Peace with one another; but it is not &s;o with us&punc; therefore we depend upon you to take Care of us; in Confidence of which, we now take up the Hatchet, and will make U&s;e of it again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> and their <HI>Indians.</HI> <STAGE>[Gave a Belt with a Hatchet.]</STAGE></P></Q>
<P>After their An&s;wer they began the War-Dance, and his Excellency ordered a con&s;iderable Pre&s;ent in Goods to be publickly given them. None of the&s;e are &s;u&s;pected to be under <HI>French</HI> Influence.</P>
<P>As there was no Advice of the Arrival of the Fleet, and no Plan of Operations agreed on in Ca&s;e the Fleet did not arrive, the Supporting of about Seven Hundred <HI>Indians</HI> was a great Expence to his Excellency, for which he had no Allowance from the Province of <HI>New-York</HI>; or for any other Charge attending this Treaty: And as many of the <HI>Indians,</HI> (above Twenty) had got the Small-Pox, it being impracticable to prevent their going into Town, or conver&s;ing with the Town's People, and the <HI>Indians</HI> becoming unea&s;y by rea&s;on of the Sickne&s;s of many, and Death of &s;ome; his Excellency thought it mo&s;t prudent to di&s;mi&s;s them as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible from this Place, and to give Orders to Mr. <HI>John&s;on,</HI> to &s;end out &s;everal Parties from <HI>Schenectade,</HI> or his own Settlement near the lower <HI>Mohawk</HI> Ca&s;tle, to hara&s;s the <HI>French</HI> Settlements in <HI>Canada</HI>; and for that Purpo&s;e delivered to him Cloathing, Arms and Ammunition, to be given to the fighting Men, as his Excellency had promi&s;ed them whenever they entered on Service, and impowered him to furni&s;h them with Provi&s;ions and whatever Nece&s;&s;aries they &s;hould want.</P>
<P>Before they went, his Excellency &s;ent to them, to de&s;ire them to leave their Sick, with a Promi&s;e to take all Care po&s;&s;ible of them; and that he would order Phy&s;icians to attend them. They were very &s;en&s;ible of this Kindne&s;s, and acknowledged it; but not above two or three could be prevailed to &s;tay, who were &s;o ill that they could not be removed: All po&s;&s;ible Care was taken of the other Sick, in the Waggons which carried them to <HI>Schenectade.</HI></P>
<P>On the 26<HI>th</HI> of <HI>September</HI> the Capts. <HI>Staats</HI> and <HI>Vromen</HI> brought the <HI>Indians</HI> living on the Branches of the <HI>Su&s;quehannah</HI> River; they came in the <HI>Indian</HI> Order, marching in a &s;ingle Line one after the other, and as they pa&s;&s;ed the Fort, &s;aluted by a running Fire along the Line; which Salute the Governor ordered to be returned by a Di&s;charge of &s;ome Cannon from the Fort.</P>
<P>On Monday the 8<HI>th</HI> of the &s;ame Month his Excellency &s;poke to them, telling them the Sub&s;tance of what he had ordered to be &s;aid to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and their An&s;wer; and as this has been &s;et forth at Length before, it is needle&s;s to repeat what was then &s;aid. The Rea&s;on of his Excellency's &s;peaking to them in this Manner, was, becau&s;e the&s;e Nations living on the <HI>Su&s;quehannah</HI> River and its Branches, are known to be Dependents on the <HI>Six Nations.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day they gave their An&s;wer; the Gentlemen of the Council; the Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs; the Corporation of <HI>Albany</HI>; the Officers of the four Independent Companies; and &s;everal Officers of the new Levies, and other Gentlemen being pre&s;ent, as they were when his Excellency &s;poke to the <HI>Indians</HI>: Their An&s;wer was publickly interpreted as follows;</P>
<Q><PB N="19" REF="005791_0018_1026EECCA2F99530">
<P>Brother of <HI>New-York,</HI></P>
<P>WE live at <HI>Ohguago</HI>; what News you &s;end to the <HI>Six Nations</HI> is not truely reported to us, nor what the Governor of <HI>Canada</HI> &s;ends to them; we have not been properly taken Notice of, nor timely acquainted with your De&s;ign to treat with the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> till near the Time that your Interview with them was over, otherwi&s;e we &s;hould have readily come along with them, to hear what our Brother had to propo&s;e to us; and if we had received earlier Notice, a much larger Number of our fighting Men would have come along with us: Our Settlements are &s;cattering, and &s;ome of them at a great Di&s;tance from others, and many of our Men are from Home a hunting; we have, however &s;ent the Belt of Invitation forward to tho&s;e who live at a greater Di&s;tance, that they may be able at the Time appointed to come and join us in the War, as by your Belt we were de&s;ired.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI> You Ye&s;terday inform'd us of what you had &s;aid to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and their An&s;wer; we are grieved that the <HI>Six Nations</HI> have not already made u&s;e of the Hatchet, but have hitherto kept it by them, and have not &s;ent out their young Men to revenge the Murders which have been committed by the Enemy.</P>
<P>We are re&s;olved to make u&s;e of the Hatchet again&s;t the French, to revenge the Injuries done to you and your People, our Brethren.</P>
<P>We have received at Times very different Kind of News from the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> &s;ometimes it &s;eem'd as if the <HI>French</HI> would be Ma&s;ters; but it cannot be &s;o, they are a deceitful People, and cannot be tru&s;ted; they make fair Promi&s;es, and have no Intention to perform them; they flatter them&s;elves with Hopes to be Ma&s;ters, but they &s;hall be di&s;appointed; for we &s;hall keep the Hatchet firmly in our Hands, and are re&s;olved to make U&s;e of it.</P>
<P>We know &s;everal Roads that lead to <HI>Canada</HI>; we want to &s;ee the Hatchet that we may take it up.</P></Q>
<P>Upon which his Excellency threw down a Hanger; which the Speaker took up and began the War-Dance, and &s;everal others danced the &s;ame after him.</P>
<P>After which they de&s;ired his Excellency to take Care of them, as he had promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>His Excellency returned them Thanks for their &s;o readily taking up the Hatchet; he &s;aid, that he would pre&s;ently &s;et the War-Kettle over the Fire, and provide them with every Thing nece&s;&s;ary for the War. His Excellency gave them a hand&s;ome Pre&s;ent in Publick for their Nations in general, and private Pre&s;ents to their principal Sachems; one of which promi&s;ed, that after his return Home, he would go round all the <HI>Indian</HI> Settlements, to invite them into the War again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> and their <HI>Indians</HI>; and that he did not doubt to be able to bring Six Hundred Men from the <HI>Indian</HI> Settlements on the <HI>Su&s;quehannah</HI> River and its Branches, to march at any Time and to any Place his Excellency &s;hall appoint, in order to join the Forces intended again&s;t <HI>Canada</HI>; in the mean Time they would cau&s;e a Party of their Men to go out with his Men to &s;cour the Woods, and clear them of the <HI>French</HI> &s;culking <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>About this Time a Serjeant of Capt. <HI>Living &s;ton's</HI> Company was &s;urprized and kill'd by a &s;culking Party of <HI>French</HI> Indians: In a few Minutes after the Account of this came to his Excellency, who happened to be Dining at that Time in Capt. <HI>Wrexall</HI>'s Tent, fourteen of the <HI>Su&s;quehannah</HI> Indians were ob&s;erv'd running pa&s;t the Tent, in order to cro&s;s the River, and meet the <HI>French</HI> Indians; which his Excellency ob&s;erving, and being apprehen&s;ive that they might meet with &s;ome of the Parties of the new Levies that were 
<PB N="20" REF="005791_0019_1026EED0769FC7A8">
gone out for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, and that they might be in Danger of being attacked through Mi&s;take; he a&s;k'd if any of the Guard which then attended, would voluntarily go along with the <HI>Indians</HI>? Two Men offered them&s;elves, who went with one who under&s;tood the <HI>Indian</HI> Language, in order to prevent Mi&s;takes. Happy it was that this Precaution was taken; for Capt. <HI>Fanning</HI> with a great Part of his Company, having gone out with the &s;ame Intention of intercepting the <HI>French</HI> Indians, he di&s;covered this Party of our <HI>Indians,</HI> and taking them to be <HI>French</HI> Indians, he kept his Men under the Cover of &s;ome Bu&s;hes, with their Arms ready to fire, expecting the nearer Approach of the <HI>Indians</HI>; when one of the Chri&s;tians, who were with them, ob&s;erving Capt. <HI>Fanning</HI>'s Men, call'd out, and came up to Capt. <HI>Fanning</HI> when his Men were ready to fire. None of the Parties that went out were able to di&s;cover any of the Enemy.</P>
<P>His Excellency afterwards &s;ent out &s;ixteen of the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> and cloathed them for that Purpo&s;e, together with about &s;ixty Men detached from the Companies levied in the County of <HI>Albany,</HI> in order to &s;cour the Woods, and to advance as far as the Lakes to gain Intelligence, by taking Pri&s;oners or otherwi&s;e. While this Party was out, &s;ome of the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;ell &s;ick, and the others being apprehen&s;ive of the &s;ame Misfortune, they return'd, after having been but a few Days in the Woods. His Excellency then perceiving the Unea&s;ine&s;s the <HI>Indians</HI> were under from the Apprehen&s;ions of Sickne&s;s, found it nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;mi&s;s them all, on their Promi&s;e to return, whenever his Excellency &s;hall order, with all the Force they &s;hall be able to collect; and which, they &s;aid, as before ob&s;erved, might amount to Six Hundred Men. The Number of <HI>Indians</HI> that came at this Time from the <HI>Su&s;quehannah</HI> River, confided only of about Sixty fighting Men, be&s;ides old Men, Women and Children: More had come near to <HI>Albany,</HI> but having there heard of the Small-Pox and Sickne&s;s that was at <HI>Albany,</HI> and that many of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> had catched the Infection, and &s;everal of them dead, they returned back.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Six Nations</HI> left <HI>Albany,</HI> many of them were taken &s;ick on their Way home, before they reached the <HI>Mohawk</HI> Ca&s;tles, and a con&s;iderable Number of the bri&s;ke&s;t young Men of the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> died. This retarded the Execution of the Order given to Mr. <HI>John&s;on,</HI> to &s;end out Parties to hara&s;s the <HI>French</HI> Settlements in <HI>Canada,</HI> tho' he u&s;ed all the Means in his Power to effect it. While he was pre&s;&s;ing them to this Purpo&s;e, one of the Sachems who had promi&s;ed to head a Party from the <HI>Canajohary</HI> Ca&s;tle, &s;aid, <HI>You &s;eem to think that we are Brutes, that we have no Sen&s;e of the Lo&s;s of our deare&s;t Relations, and &s;ome of them the brave&s;t Men we had in our Nation: You mu&s;t allow us Time to bewail our Misfortune.</HI></P>
<P>About ten Days before his Excellency left <HI>Albany,</HI> a Party of upwards of Seventy Men, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ome of each Nation, went again&s;t <HI>Canada</HI>: Some Chri&s;tians were of the Party to a&s;&s;i&s;t and direct, and to be Witne&s;&s;e&s;s of the Behaviour of the <HI>Indians.</HI> They were to avoid all the Lakes, and the u&s;ual Roads and Pa&s;&s;es to <HI>Canada,</HI> and were to go through the Woods over Mountains, that are &s;eldom pa&s;&s;ed, to prevent the Enemies di&s;covering of them: But after the&s;e had been out, Capt. <HI>Butler</HI>'s Son, to whom the chief Direction of this Party was committed, was taken ill of the Small-Pox, and five of the <HI>Indians</HI> were obliged to return to carry him Home. Another &s;mall Party was &s;ent out to take Pri&s;oners and gain Intelligence at <HI>Crown-Point.</HI> At the Writing of this it is not known what Succe&s;s they have had.</P>

When the <HI>Six Nations</HI> had come as far as the Lower <HI>Mohawk</HI> Ca&s;tle, in their return Home, they were met by about &s;ix Men of their own Nations, who delivered a Me&s;&s;age from <HI>Canada,</HI> which had been brought by the <HI>Indian</HI> who was taken by the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Crown Point</HI> and carried to <HI>Canada.</HI> The Me&s;&s;age was interpreted in the following Words: <Q>The Governor of <HI>Canada</HI> had called the <HI>Cahnuaga</HI> Indians to him, and then complain'd to them, that &s;ome of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> his Children, had kill'd &s;ome of his People: You all know, <HI>be &s;aid,</HI> that I am not ha&s;ty or pa&s;&s;ionate, but will rather bear a great Deal than &s;hew Re&s;entment; wherefore I am re&s;olved to pa&s;s this over; but in the mean Time I mu&s;t de&s;ire you to go among the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> to find out the Rea&s;on of this Proceeding, and to tell them, that if any Thing like it happen again, I will make them &s;mart: You may, neverthele&s;s, a&s;&s;ure my Children

<P>The <HI>Cahnuagas</HI> gave the following An&s;wer to the Governor of <HI>Canada:</HI> Father, <HI>You are in the Wrong, to de&s;ire us to go among the</HI> Six Nations <HI>for Intelligence, or with Menaces; for &s;uch will only &s;tir them up, and bring them and all their Allies (who are very numerous) upon you, to de&s;troy you at once.

<P>After having, as above, related what had pa&s;&s;ed between them and the Governor of <HI>Canada,</HI> they &s;ent the following Me&s;&s;age from them&s;elves:</P>
<P><HI>Brethren of the Six Nations,</HI> <Q>We hear the Governor of <HI>New-York</HI> has invited you to meet him; we intreat you not to mind any thing he &s;hall &s;ay, in order to &s;et you again&s;t us; for if you do, you, as well as we, ma&s;t all dye. Wherefore, <HI>Brethren,</HI> we conjure you by all the Ties of Friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between us, to inform us of any De&s;ign that is plotting again&s;t us; and that, when any &s;uch Thing &s;hall be di&s;covered, you will &s;end an Expre&s;s to <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ckui,</HI>

<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI> We &s;hall be glad to &s;ee you next Spring at <HI>Cahnuaga,</HI> to hold a Council together, where you &s;hall be as &s;afe and wellcome as ever.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> The Governor our Father, being Informed, that your Governor is rai&s;ing Men to come again&s;t <HI>Canada,</HI> de&s;ires us to tell you, that he has <HI>One Thou&s;and eight hundred</HI> Men at <HI>Crown Point,</HI> ready to give them Battle; in which Number the Men of eight Ca&s;tles of the <HI>Utawawas</HI> are included.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> Be not angry at our de&s;troying <HI>Saraghtoga</HI> la&s;t Fall; Col. <HI>Schuyler</HI> dar'd us to it, by &s;aying he wi&s;hed to &s;ee a <HI>French</HI> Army there: We gratified him in his Wi&s;h.</P></Q>
<P>A <HI>Cahnuaga</HI> Indian was &s;ent along with the Pri&s;oner that was re&s;tored; but when he came near the Settlements of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> his Heart fail'd him, and be &s;ent the Pri&s;oner forward by him&s;elf with the Me&s;&s;age.</P>

The Readine&s;s with which the <HI>Six Nations</HI> communicated this Me&s;&s;age, and the Slight they in all Appearance put upon it, is &s;ome Proof of their Sincerity in the Promi&s;es they made to his Excellency; neither from any Thing which has happened can it be &s;hewn; that they were not &s;incere. On the Contrary, it appears by Mr. <HI>John&s;on</HI>'s Letter to his Excellency, of the 21&s;t of <HI>October,</HI> That &s;everal Parties are now out again&s;t the <HI>French</HI>; and that Mr. <HI>John&s;on</HI> having received Orders from Col. <HI>Roberts,</HI> to &s;end as many <HI>Indians</HI> as po&s;&s;ible to join the Army; all the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> even their old Men, were &s;itted out and ready; and having &s;ent to the Upper Ca&s;tles at the &s;ame Time, they appeared &s;o hearty, that there would not have remained above three old Men in any of the next Ca&s;tles: And that Col. <HI>Roberts</HI> afterwards contradicting the&s;e Orders, they had appeared very unea&s;y on their being &s;topt. It was not expected, that they would enter into the Wat without us, or by them&s;elves, neither are they a People of &s;o little Thought as to give any Rea&s;on to expect it from them.</P>
<P>When the Companies rais'd in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Albany,</HI> his Excellency was informed by their Captains, that Mr. <HI>Thomas,</HI> Governor of that Province, had &s;ent <HI>Conrad Wei&s;er,</HI> their publick Interpreter, among the <HI>Su&s;quehannah</HI> Indians; and that they expected his Arrival at this Place in a little Time, with, at lea&s;t, three hundred <HI>Indians.</HI> The Treaties with the <HI>Indians,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Thomas</HI> has publi&s;hed, gave great Hopes of the Succe&s;s that Interpreter would have; and thereby increa&s;ed the Di&s;appointment, when Mr. <HI>Wei&s;er</HI> arrived a few Days before his Excellency left <HI>Albany,</HI> and did not bring one <HI>Indian</HI> with him.</P>
<P>His Excellency Governor <HI>Clinton,</HI> had perhaps more Difficulties to &s;truggle with on this Occa&s;ion, than any Governor of <HI>New-York</HI> had at any Time The <HI>Six Nations</HI> had on &s;everal Occa&s;ions given Grounds of Mi&s;tru&s;t; the Governor of <HI>Canada</HI> was attempting all the Means in his Power to divert their Affections from us; the People of the County of <HI>Albany</HI> had for &s;ome time pa&s;t, entertain'd a Di&s;&s;atisfaction in the Conduct of the Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs; the Commi&s;&s;ioners them&s;elves were divided in their Sentiments, and &s;everal of them refu&s;ed to attend their Meetings; and they confe&s;es'd to his Excellency, that they had lo&s;t all Influence on the <HI>Indians</HI>; Mr. <HI>Gooch</HI> having declined the Command of the Forces at <HI>Albany,</HI> his Excellency was forced likewi&s;e to undertake a new and great Care, which he in no Manner expected when he left the City of <HI>New-York,</HI> and which from many Incidents, was attended with many Difficulties. If the&s;e Things be duly con&s;idered, and the Dangers his Per&s;on was in from the Infection of two different Di&s;ea&s;es, which at that Time raged in the City of <HI>Albany,</HI> of which great Numbers died during his Re&s;idence there of near three Months; none can doubt of his hearty Zeal for the Succe&s;s of an Affair, in which the Safety and Pro&s;perity of all the Colonies in North <HI>America,</HI> were immediately concerned.</P>
<P>But as every one may not be &s;ufficiently apprized of what Con&s;equence the <HI>Six Nations</HI> being hearty, is of to the Intere&s;t of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> it may be proper to ob&s;erve, That tho'a Number of <HI>Indians</HI> to march with the Army, which was intended to attack <HI>Canada,</HI> would be of great U&s;e in di&s;covering and defeating the Ambu&s;hes of the Enemy's <HI>Indians,</HI> while they were every Day to be guarded again&s;t by the Forces which were to march by Land, and would by their Incur&s;ions into the Enemy's Country, terribly hara&s;s them, and keep them from joining their Forces into any great Body to oppo&s;e the De&s;ign; the&s;e are not the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Advantages may be gain'd from the Affection 
<PB N="23" REF="005791_0022_1026EED5DABE1D78">
of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> at this Time; or any Time of War; for if the inland Extent of the Colonies from <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> to <HI>Georgia</HI> be con&s;idered, and at the &s;ame Time the numerous <HI>Indian</HI> Nations on the Continent of <HI>America,</HI> who may by the Artifices of the <HI>French</HI> be induced to make Incur&s;ions every where; and the cruel Methods by which the <HI>Indians</HI> make Incur&s;ions in &s;mall Parties from the va&s;t Fore&s;t which every where covers the Continent, and which in many Places is impenetrable; it mu&s;t evidently appear, that tho' the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies be of much &s;uperior Force to the <HI>French</HI> in Numbers of Men, yet their Number would not be &s;ufficient to protect their Frontiers from the Incur&s;ions of the <HI>Indians</HI> in every Place: And, that while their Forces mu&s;t in this Ca&s;e be divided and &s;cattered all over their Frontiers, it may be in the Power of the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>Canada,</HI> to invade with Succe&s;s any Part of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies. On the other Hand, if a proper Attempt were to be made by the northern Colonies alone, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of their Mother Country; but with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Indians,</HI> it would in all Appearance be &s;ufficient to reduce <HI>Canada</HI>; for if the <HI>Indian</HI> Nations can be per&s;waded to join heartily, (as from what is above related &s;eems probable they may) it will be impo&s;&s;ible for the Inhabitants of <HI>Canada</HI> to defend them&s;elves from the Incur&s;ions of the&s;e numerous <HI>Indian</HI> Nations, and from a Body of regular Troops at the &s;ame Time. As the <HI>French</HI> are very &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e Advantages to be gain'd from the Friend&s;hip of the <HI>Indian</HI> Nations, they neglect no Means in their Power to procure them: And it is to be hoped, that the nothern Colonies will be no lets a&s;&s;idious in a Matter on which their Well-being at lea&s;t depends.</P>
<P>Some People wi&s;h, that the <HI>Indians</HI> may remain Neuter, and think it advi&s;eable to pur&s;ue Mea&s;ures for that Purpo&s;e, by which many horrid Barbarities would be prevented. No doubt this is to be wi&s;hed; but can the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies by any Means be a&s;&s;ured, that the <HI>French</HI> will be &s;incere in pre&s;erving &s;uch a Neutrality? And if they be not &s;incere, we &s;hall more certainly expo&s;e our&s;elves to all the&s;e Calamities, than we are now by <HI>Indians</HI> being engaged on both Sides. The <HI>Six Nations</HI> are by their natural Inclinations di&s;po&s;ed to War-like Enterprizes: They never have been at Peace with all their Neighbours &s;ince they were known to Chri&s;tians. The Reputation they have gain'd among all the <HI>Indian</HI> Nations in North <HI>America,</HI> gives them an Influence in the Councils of every Nation. It may then be ea&s;y for the <HI>French</HI> to turn this Di&s;po&s;ition to War in the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> again&s;t us, and by their Influence draw all the <HI>Indian</HI> Nations in North <HI>America</HI> upon us. The Genius of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> will not &s;uffer them to remain inactive while their Neighbours are at War.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t Place, it may not be improper to ob&s;erve at this Time, that tho' the Colonies to the Southward (and the Inhabitants of the Parts of the northern Colonies, which are le&s;s expo&s;ed to the Incur&s;ions of <HI>Indians</HI>) think them&s;elves little concern'd in Intere&s;t, or in the Con&s;equences of the pre&s;ent War; yet if they would con&s;ider that the northern Colonies are really their Frontier, and that they defend the others from all the Calamities of a mo&s;t barbarous War; the &s;outhern Colonies mu&s;t think that any Contribution of Men and Money, which is expected from them, is an ea&s;y Purcha&s;e of the Freedom from &s;uch Calamities to which their Brethren are &s;ubjected; and that while they can follow their Occupations at Ea&s;e, they are much better enabled to &s;upport the Expence of a War than the northern Colonies are, where the Inhabitants are every Day in Danger of their Lives from a cruel Enemy, while at their daily and innocent Labours. If the &s;outhern Colonies neglect to keep the War at a Di&s;tance from them, they may at an improper Time, become &s;en&s;ible of the Evils their Brethren &s;uffer, and of their own Folly at the &s;ame Time.</P>
