<P>IT was the unhappy ca&s;e of Agrippa, that though <HI>almo&s;t,</HI> he was only <HI>almo&s;t, per&s;uaded to be a Chri&s;tian</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Acts xxvi. 28.</NOTE>; and I fear, it is now the ca&s;e of many, and particularly of many <HI>young per&s;ons,</HI> who have enjoyed the advantages of a religious education. I believe it is difficult to find any among&s;t them, who have not been brought under &s;ome &s;erious impre&s;&s;ions betimes. With regard to the internal operations of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, as well as external means, <HI>the morn|ing of life</HI> is generally to them, in a peculiar &s;en&s;e, <HI>the day of their vi&s;itation</HI>; and they often &s;eem to know it, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure to improve it: but in too many in&s;tances we find their <HI>good|ne&s;s as a morning cloud, and as the early dew, which &s;oon pa&s;&s;eth away</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Ho&s;. vi. 4.</NOTE>. The blo&s;&s;oms open fair and beautiful, and give a very agreeable pro&s;pect of the plentiful fruits of holine&s;s in life: but too often, when &s;torms of temptation and corruption ari&s;e, the goodly appearance is laid in ruins; the blo&s;&s;oms do as it were fall to the ground, and leave the tree bla&s;ted and naked; or at be&s;t co|vered only with leaves of an external profe&s;&s;ion,

which, however green and flouri&s;hing they may for the pre&s;ent be, will not at la&s;t &s;ecure it from being <HI>cut down and ca&s;t into the burning.</HI> Though <HI>they</HI> for a while <HI>had e&s;caped the pollutions of the world</HI> through lu&s;t, <HI>they are</HI> afterwards <HI>entangled</HI> and &s;ubdued; and the con&s;equence is, they prove a &s;candal to religion, and a di&s;couragement to others, till, in the end, they bring aggravated de&s;truction on them&s;elves; &s;o that on the whole, as the <HI>apo&s;tle</HI> mo&s;t ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, <HI>It had been better for them not to have known the way of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, than</HI> thus, <HI>after they have known it, to turn a&s;ide from the holy commandment</HI> <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. ii. 21.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS may be in a great mea&s;ure owing to the mutability of human nature in general, and particularly to the levity and incon&s;tancy of youth, in conjunction with the force of tho&s;e temptations of life, which continually &s;urround and pre&s;s upon them. Yet I apprehend this is not all, but that it is, in part, to be charged on &s;omething defective, even in their be&s;t days, on their re&s;ting in &s;omething &s;hort of real religion, and a true &s;aving change. Solomon had &s;een rea&s;on to &s;ay, <HI>There is a way that &s;eemeth right to a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death</HI> <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Prov. xiv. 12.</NOTE>: and I believe every con&s;iderate per&s;on will be ready to own, that in order to prevent &s;o fatal a delu&s;ion, and all the train of mi&s;chiefs which may follow upon it, great care &s;hould be taken in &s;tating this important que&s;tion;
<Q>What is the true and &s;olid <HI>ba&s;is,</HI> on which we may &s;ecurely ground our eternal hopes?</Q>
It is a que&s;tion of the highe&s;t importance, and the mo&s;t univer|&s;al concern, both to the <HI>aged</HI> and the <HI>young</HI>; &s;o that I tru&s;t I need not offer any apology for
<PB N="5" REF="024272_0004_0FC5F7EE54E4F408">
complying with the reque&s;t of a pious and ju|dicious friend, who recommended this &s;ubject to our con&s;ideration, at this time, and on this occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>IN pro&s;ecution of this de&s;ign, I have made choice of the&s;e words of the <HI>apo&s;tle,</HI> which I have now been reading, and which may, without offer|ing any violence to them, be very fairly and naturally accommodated to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>IT is plain from many pa&s;&s;ages in this epi&s;tle, that the great apo&s;tle, who had planted the Chri&s;|tian church among the Galatians, had rea&s;on to fear, that many, who were by profe&s;&s;ion its mem|bers, were not &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed in their holy faith. It is probable; that he him&s;elf had an opportunity of making but a &s;hort &s;tay among&s;t them; and, partly through their own negligence and prejudices, and partly through the artful attempts of fal&s;e teachers, in the ab&s;ence of St. Paul, they appear to have fallen into a &s;et of no|tions, and a conduct, which tended not only to impair the glory, but to &s;ubvert the very foun|dation of the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> and with it the foundation of their own eternal hopes. Of this the apo&s;tle does, in a very awful manner, admoni&s;h them. He tells them, in the very beginning of his epi&s;|tle, that <HI>he marvelled, that they were &s;o &s;oon remov|ed from him that called them</HI> (and from the prin|ciples he had taught them) <HI>into another go&s;pel</HI> <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Gal. i. 6.</NOTE>. And afterwards he u&s;eth the&s;e very free and em|phatical words: <HI>O fooli&s;h Galatians, who hath be|witched,</HI> or enchanted <HI>you, that you &s;hould not obey the truth? Are you &s;o fooli&s;h? Having begun in the &s;pirit</HI> (having profe&s;&s;ed to embrace the go&s;pel, and &s;hewn the appearances of &s;ome common zeal
<PB N="6" REF="024272_0005_0FC5F7EFA4D8EC20">
for it) can <HI>you now</HI> hope to be <HI>made perfect by the fle&s;h,</HI> or by the ritual and carnal ob&s;ervances of the Mo&s;aic in&s;titution? Is it thus that you di&s;grace all you have done, and all you have borne for Chri&s;t? <HI>Have you</HI> then <HI>&s;uffered &s;o many things in vain</HI> <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 1&mdash;4.</NOTE>? On the whole, he tells them, he was ready to apprehend, that all the agreeable hopes he had once entertained concerning them, would be buried in everla&s;ting di&s;appointment, and that it would appear, <HI>he had be&s;towed upon them labour in vain</HI> <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Chap. iv. 11.</NOTE>. Thus did he <HI>&s;tand in doubt of them</HI> <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Chap. iv. 29.</NOTE>; and that doubt pierced his heart with the mo&s;t tender concern, and brought upon him, as it were a &s;econd time, tho&s;e pangs of &s;oul which he had felt on their account, when he &s;aw them in all the ignorance and wickedne&s;s of their Gentile &s;tate. He was hardly more &s;olicitous then, that they might be <HI>turned from dumb idols to the living GOD,</HI> than he was now, that they might give convincing evidences that CHRIST was <HI>formed in them,</HI> i. e. that they had cordially received and dige&s;ted the go&s;pel, and that their hearts were <HI>delivered into the mould of it</HI> <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Rom vi. 17.</NOTE>: which it did not appear they were, while they were thus making void the grace of GOD, and the righteou&s;ne&s;s of faith, by adhering to the fooli&s;h and pernicious doctrine of the nece&s;|&s;ity of &s;eeking their <HI>ju&s;tification,</HI> in part at lea&s;t, by the ob&s;ervation of the Mo&s;aic law.</P>
<P>THIS &s;eems to be the mo&s;t natural &s;en&s;e of the words of the text, where &s;uch a latitude of expre&s;&s;ion is u&s;ed, as the apo&s;tle el&s;ewhere &s;eems to &s;tudy, on purpo&s;e to render his writings uni|ver&s;ally edifying, and u&s;eful to <HI>them,</HI> who&s;e par|ticular

circum&s;tances in life are widely different from tho&s;e of the per&s;ons to whom they were originally addre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>AS to the introductory words, <HI>My little chil|dren,</HI> we cannot imagine they refer to the <HI>age</HI> of tho&s;e to whom the apo&s;tle wrote. The evident de&s;ign of them is, to expre&s;s that kind of parental tenderne&s;s which he entertained for them, like that which a mother hath for an infant with which &s;he travails in birth. <HI>My little children, of whom I travail in birth again, till Chri&s;t be formed in you.</HI></P>
<P>IT would be ea&s;y to multiply ob&s;ervations from the words. I might e&s;pecially take occa|&s;ion to &s;hew,&mdash;that it is po&s;&s;ible, tho&s;e that once &s;eemed very hopeful, and &s;till maintain an exter|nal profe&s;&s;ion, may appear, after all, in &s;uch dan|gerous circum&s;tances, that judicious <HI>mini&s;ters,</HI> and other <HI>Chri&s;tian friends,</HI> may be thrown into a great deal of perplexity and agony on their account;&mdash;and that the great thing nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h their &s;afety, and the comfort of tho&s;e concerned for them, is, that the <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t be formed in them.</HI></P>
<P>THAT I may more particularly illu&s;trate and improve the text, and take in what is mo&s;t im|portant in the&s;e remarks, I will
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. CONSIDER &s;everal things, on which men are ready to build <HI>a fal&s;e confidence,</HI> which will bring them into danger, and their ju|dicious friends into perplexity upon their account.</ITEM>

<ITEM>III. I SHALL conclude with &s;ome more par|ticular <HI>improvement,</HI> in proper inferences from the whole.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>THESE are plainly matters of <HI>univer&s;al impor|tance</HI>; but as I am now peculiarly addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to <HI>young per&s;ons,</HI> I &s;hall endeavour to fix on tho&s;e thoughts, which may be mo&s;t remark|ably &s;uitable to them: for I am much more con|cerned that my di&s;cour&s;e may be u&s;eful, than that it may be critically regular and exact. I hope there are many among&s;t you, who are experi|mentally acquainted with the vitals of Chri&s;tian|ity, and have received from above an <HI>incorrup|tible &s;eed</HI> <NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 23.</NOTE>.

I would endeavour, with the &s;incere&s;t and tendere&s;t affection, and with &s;uch freedom as the importance of the ca&s;e requires, to guard you again&s;t tho&s;e <HI>&s;andy foundations,</HI> which will bury you and your hopes deep in eternal ruins; and to direct you to <HI>the Rock of Ages,</HI> on which they who build &s;hall <HI>never be a&s;hamed.</HI></P>
<P>I THEREFORE intreat your &s;erious attention, and would humbly a&s;k, both for my&s;elf and you, the teachings of that ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Spirit,</HI> who&s;e pecu|liar office it is, in the mo&s;t efficacious manner, to &s;hew us our danger and our remedy; to aid the labouring minds of <HI>mini&s;ters,</HI> and to cau&s;e

<P N="1">I. I AM to caution you again&s;t &s;everal things, on which <HI>young per&s;ons</HI> are peculiarly prone to build <HI>a fal&s;e</HI> and precarious <HI>confidence.</HI></P>
<P>AND here let me particularly intreat you, as you love your &s;ouls, and value your eternal hopes,&mdash;that you <HI>tru&s;t not</HI> to the privileges of your birth,&mdash;or the rectitude of your &s;pecula|tions in matters of religion,&mdash;or the purity and frequency of your forms of wor&s;hip,&mdash;or the warmth of your pa&s;&s;ions,&mdash;or the morality of your conduct: for none of the&s;e apart, nor even all of them united, can, according to the tenor of the go&s;pel, be &s;ufficient for your &s;ecurity and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>1. TRUST not to the privileges of your <HI>birth</HI> and <HI>education,</HI> as the foundation of your eternal hopes.</P>
<P>YOU are, many of you, <HI>the &s;eed</HI> of GOD's &s;ervants, perhaps for &s;everal &s;ucceeding genera|tions. You may be ready to plead, that you were <HI>born in his hou&s;e,</HI> that you were early devot|ed to him in <HI>bapti&s;m,</HI> and have been <HI>brought up</HI> in the mo&s;t regular and con&s;cientious manner: you have been &s;urrounded with holy in&s;tructions and corre&s;pondent examples from your infancy; and repeated fervent prayers, both in the family and in &s;ecret, have been &s;ent up to heaven upon your account. The&s;e are indeed &s;ignal advan|tages, and you may ju&s;tly rejoice in them; for, in the&s;e re&s;pects, you are <HI>the children of the king|dom:</HI> but <HI>rejoice with trembling</HI>; for our Lord
<PB N="10" REF="024272_0009_0FC5F80B66477BF8">

The peculiar regard &s;hewn to <HI>the &s;eed</HI> of Abraham, may perhaps be abu&s;ed by &s;ome of you, as an encouragement to tho&s;e pre&s;umptuous hopes. But remember, that I&s;hmael was the <HI>&s;on</HI> of Abra|ham, and E&s;au of I&s;aac; and yet neither the one, nor the other, <HI>inherited the ble&s;&s;ing</HI> of his father. Remember that beautiful, but dreadful <HI>parable,</HI> which repre&s;ents a wretched creature <HI>in hell,</HI> that could cry, <HI>Father</HI> Abraham, and yet in vain added, <HI>Have mercy upon me, and &s;end me but a drop of water to cool my tongue</HI> <NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">Luke xvi. 24.</NOTE>. Once more, remember tho&s;e emphatical words of the Bapti&s;t, &s;o expre&s;sly levelled again&s;t this arro|gant pre&s;umption: <HI>Think not</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>to &s;ay within your&s;elves, We have Abraham for our fa|ther; for I &s;ay unto you, that GOD is able, of the&s;e &s;tones, to rai&s;e up children unto Abraham</HI> <NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">Mat. iii. 9.</NOTE>: As if he &s;hould have &s;aid,
<Q>The promi&s;es made to tho&s;e who are the <HI>children of</HI> Abraham, re|&s;pect not merely them who are lineally de&s;cend|ed from him; but tho&s;e who are the heirs of his piety and his faith; for if GOD were to turn the&s;e &s;tones into men, and to form them by his grace to a holy character and temper, &s;uch, though de&s;cended from no human pa|rents at all, would, in the &s;en&s;e of the promi&s;e, be <HI>children of</HI> Abraham.</Q>
And it were more rea&s;onable to expect &s;uch a tran&s;mutation, than that GOD &s;hould acknowledge <HI>a generation of vipers</HI> as his people, becau&s;e they were derived from <HI>holy ance&s;tors.</HI> On the contrary, GOD directly a&s;&s;ures us, that if <HI>the &s;on</HI> of the mo&s;t

And <HI>&s;urely</HI> herein <HI>the ways of the Lord are</HI> apparently <HI>equal</HI>; for it is mo&s;t evident, that a long de&s;cent from GOD's people is a reproach and condemnation, rather than an honour, to tho&s;e who abandon that good old way in which their ance&s;tors have trod, and, as it were, cut off that intail of piety, which has been the care and the glory of preceding generations.</P>
<P>2. TRUST not to the <HI>regularity of your &s;enti|ments,</HI> in matters of religion, as the founda|tion of your eternal hopes.</P>
<P>SO various are the workings of men's hearts, and the devices of Satan, that, if I mi&s;take not, there are &s;ome that place their confidence in the <HI>&s;trictne&s;s,</HI> and others in the <HI>latitude</HI> of their reli|gious opinions; but the one, and the other, will appear <HI>equally vain,</HI> when con&s;idered in the view now before us.</P>
<P>SOME may po&s;&s;ibly per&s;uade them&s;elves, that their condition is &s;ecure, becau&s;e their <HI>&s;entiments</HI> are <HI>orthodox.</HI> They live perhaps in the mid&s;t of the unbelieving and profane, and &s;ee daily contempt and deri&s;ion thrown upon the ble&s;&s;ed go&s;pel, or its mo&s;t glorious peculiarities; but through the influence of a good education, or from &s;ome other principle, &s;hort of true piety, they may neverthele&s;s not only <HI>hold fa&s;t the faith once deli|vered to the &s;aints,</HI> but even <HI>contend earne&s;tly for it,</HI> <NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">Jude, <HI>ver.</HI> 3.</NOTE>: nay, they are, perhaps, learned in the con|trover&s;ies of the time; and can indeed pronounce

<P>IF this, my friends, be the ca&s;e with any of you, I congratulate you on the happine&s;s of a well-informed judgment, but mu&s;t caution you again&s;t mi&s;taking it for a &s;anctified heart. <HI>The my&s;tery of faith,</HI> as the apo&s;tle him&s;elf a&s;&s;ures us, is <HI>to be held with a good con&s;cience</HI> <NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. i. 19.</NOTE>: and in vain do you profe&s;s to retain the one, while you <HI>make &s;hipwreck</HI> of the other. As precious a trea|&s;ure as the knowledge of the truth is, if we go no farther than mere &s;peculation, it will be to you
<Q>but as a talent of gold to a man &s;inking in the &s;ea, which only &s;erves to plunge him &s;o much the deeper in ruin <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Bates' Works, <HI>page</HI> 938.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>THERE are others who err in the contrary ex|treme. <HI>Orthodox notions</HI> are <HI>their banter,</HI> rather than <HI>their confidence.</HI> They pride them&s;elves in having broke the &s;hackles in which others are confined, and in &s;eeing through the mi&s;t in which multitudes have been perplexed. They are &s;en|&s;ible, that many things which divide the world are merely <HI>controver&s;ies about words</HI>; and are not much concerned about others in which there is a real difference, becau&s;e they are well aware, that the <HI>fundamentals of religion</HI> lie in a very little room. They are confident of the innocency of error, and the &s;afety of an <HI>hone&s;t mind</HI> under tho&s;e mi&s;takes which have been branded by the &s;evere&s;t names. A wicked life is, in their e&s;|teem, the only dangerous here&s;y; and <HI>morality</HI> the only thing that is worth contending about. Charmed with their own wi&s;dom and happine&s;s in this freedom of thought, they look down with

<P>3. WHAT <HI>need</HI> is there of the work of the di|vine <HI>Spirit</HI> on the heart, in order to the lay|ing <HI>this great foundation?</HI></P>
<P>THE language of the text, which &s;peaks of <HI>Chri&s;t formed in us,</HI> naturally leads our thoughts to &s;ome <HI>agent,</HI> by whom the work is done; and when you con&s;ider what kind of a work it is, I appeal to your own con&s;ciences, whether it is to be thought merely a <HI>human production.</HI> Were it only a name, a ceremony, a &s;peculation, or a pa&s;&s;ion, it would not be worth a moment's di&s;|pute, whether <HI>you</HI> or <HI>we</HI> &s;hould have the glory of it.

<P>LET us therefore, on the whole, learn our duty and our wi&s;dom. Let the matter be brought to a &s;erious and immediate review, and let us <HI>judge our&s;elves</HI> by the character de&s;cribed, as tho&s;e that

If nothing be indeed found of great|er moment, apply your&s;elves &s;eriou&s;ly to this, and omit no proper and rational methods of &s;e|curing it. Con&s;ider the ways by which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> u&s;es to enter into a &s;oul, and wait upon him in tho&s;e ways. Reflect &s;eriou&s;ly on your pre&s;ent condition; con&s;tantly attend the in&s;tructions of his word, and the other &s;olemnities of his wor&s;hip; and chu&s;e to conver&s;e intimately with tho&s;e, in whom you have rea&s;on to think <HI>he is already formed.</HI> But in all remember, that the &s;ucce&s;s depends upon a <HI>divine co-operation,</HI> and therefore go frequently into the pre&s;ence of GOD by <HI>prayer</HI>; go into it this day, or if po&s;&s;ible this hour, and importunately intreat the regene|rating and &s;anctifying influences of his <HI>Spirit,</HI> which, when you earne&s;tly de&s;ire them, the <HI>go&s;pel</HI> gives you &s;uch ample encouragement to expect. &mdash;But if you have rea&s;on to hope that you have <HI>already received them,</HI> learn to what the <HI>prai&s;e</HI> &s;hould be a&s;cribed; and let it animate you to <HI>pray,</HI> that, through farther communications from the throne of grace, you may be made continual|ly more and more <HI>like</HI> to your <HI>Redeemer,</HI> till you are prepared for that world, where you &s;hall <HI>&s;hine forth</HI> in his complete re&s;emblance, and &s;hall find it your complete and eternal felicity.
