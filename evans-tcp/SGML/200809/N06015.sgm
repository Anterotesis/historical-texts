<HEAD>The World in which there is NO CURSE.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Rev. xxii. 3.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>And there &s;hall be no more</HI> CURSE.&mdash;</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MY text falls in that part of the <HI>revelation of God</HI> to his &s;ervant <HI>John,</HI> by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> which relates to the <HI>re&s;urrection-world;</HI> and among the <HI>characteri&s;ticks</HI> here given of <HI>this world,</HI> that is an ob&s;er|vable one, <HI>no more</HI> CURSE <HI>&s;hall be there.</HI></P>
<P>The words evidently allude to <HI>that Cur&s;e,</HI> which the righteous God, in the days of <HI>Adam,</HI> and for <HI>his &s;in</HI> in eating of the forbidden tree, fa&s;tened on <HI>the earth;</HI> changing it from its <HI>paradi&s;aick</HI> &s;tate, to one that was adapted to be an occa&s;ion of <HI>toil,</HI> and <HI>&s;orrow,</HI> and <HI>death,</HI> not only to <HI>him,</HI> but to his <HI>po&s;terity,</HI> throughout all generations.</P>
<P>I cannot therefore give you a more ju&s;t or lively idea of the <HI>re&s;urrection-world,</HI> as de&s;cribed in my text, than by dilating upon the <HI>&s;tate</HI> of our <HI>pre&s;ent earth,</HI> by rea&s;on of the primitive <HI>cur&s;e;</HI> for one of the <HI>di&s;|tingui&s;hing marks</HI> here given of <HI>that world</HI> is, that it has <HI>no &s;uch</HI> CURSE <HI>cleaving to it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="007634_0004_102D96ADE4C7E4C0">
Tis both &s;een, and felt, by unhappy experience, that the <HI>earth,</HI> in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, is &s;uch, as that it is impo&s;&s;ible for any &s;on or daughter of <HI>Adam</HI> to po&s;&s;e&s;s life on it, but in <HI>&s;uffering</HI> circum&s;tances, in a le&s;s or greater degree. As the &s;cripture &s;peaks, <HI>Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble:</HI> He is <HI>born to trouble as the &s;parks fly upwards.</HI> And &s;uch indeed are the inconveniencies and tryals, &s;uch the labors and &s;orrows, we are all &s;ubjected to, by the very con&s;titution of the <HI>earth</HI> we live upon, &s;o various in their Kind, and &s;o unavoidable in their nature, that the pre&s;ent &s;tate of exi&s;tence may properly be con&s;idered as a &s;cene of <HI>vanity, &s;uffering,</HI> and <HI>death;</HI> and the longer we any of us continue in it, the more thorough|ly we are convinced, that this is the real truth of the ca&s;e. Some, perhaps, &s;uffer more evil than they en|joy good; and if any enjoy more good than they &s;uffer evil, tis but in a &s;mall degree. The &s;ame earth that is fitted to give us plea&s;ure, is fitted al&s;o to give us pain; and every convenience is &s;o attended with &s;ome oppo&s;ite inconvenience, that tis hard to &s;ay, in many ca&s;es, on which &s;ide the ballance mo&s;t commonly turns. At the be&s;t, our condition here is &s;o chequered with interchangeable evil and good, that we may all take to our &s;elves words, and with accurate truth &s;ay, <HI>vanity of vanities, all is vanity, and vexation of &s;pirit.</HI></P>
<P>And was this the &s;tate, in which God created the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of our race? The &s;cripture &s;ays no &s;uch thing; but quite the rever&s;e: Informing us, that, upon man's <HI>becoming a living &s;oul,</HI> that is, a being capable of com|munication with material nature, in a way of perception and enjoyment, he found it every way adapted to his convenience and delight, as well as &s;upport in life. The earth was endow'd with prolifick virtue, and cau&s;ed to bring forth every kind of fruit, plea&s;ant to his &s;ight, and good for food. And as to <HI>death,</HI> he was guarded
<PB N="7" REF="007634_0005_102D96B047A66B78">
from its touch by <HI>the tree of life, planted in the mid&s;t of the paradi&s;e of God:</HI> Nor was there, in this happy place, any of tho&s;e occa&s;ions of <HI>pain,</HI> and <HI>&s;orrow,</HI> and <HI>tears,</HI> which we <HI>now</HI> groan under. It was owing to the <HI>di&s;obedience</HI> of the <HI>one man Adam,</HI> in the &s;pecial article wherein he was tried, and the CURSE of God thereby bro't on the <HI>earth,</HI> that <HI>death entered into</HI> the world, with its forerunners, and appendages, in all their frightful and tormenting forms; and has reigned ever &s;ince, and even over tho&s;e, who <HI>&s;inned not after the &s;imi|litude of his tra&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>Tis plain from <HI>revelation,</HI> however undi&s;coverable any other way, that the &s;tate of the <HI>earth,</HI> and the circum|&s;tances of mankind, as living on it, are va&s;tly different from what they would have been, had not <HI>Adam</HI> fell by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. The <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> inflicted on the <HI>earth,</HI> by rea&s;on of his &s;in, can be explained in no intelligible &s;en&s;e, upon any other &s;uppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The words of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> are expre&s;s in declaring, that it was <HI>for man's &s;ake,</HI> that is, for his &s;in; and that he might be &s;ubjected to a &s;tate of <HI>labor,</HI> and <HI>&s;orrow,</HI> and <HI>death,</HI> that the <HI>earth</HI> was <HI>cur&s;ed.</HI> But, in what con|conceivable &s;en&s;e, could God's <HI>cur&s;ing the earth</HI> be a means of &s;ubjecting man to the&s;e di&s;advantages, if the <HI>earth</HI> was not thereby <HI>changed</HI> into a <HI>wor&s;e &s;tate</HI> than it was in before his fall, that is, a &s;tate le&s;s fitted to give him <HI>plea&s;ure,</HI> and more adapted to be an occa&s;ion of <HI>grief,</HI> and to bring on <HI>death?</HI> It &s;hould &s;eem certain, if the <HI>earth,</HI> in its <HI>original</HI> &s;tate, was &s;imilar to what it is in its <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> condition, there would have been no need of a <HI>cur&s;e</HI> from God in order to its bringing forth <HI>thorns and thi&s;tles,</HI> and being an occa&s;ion of <HI>toil</HI> and <HI>&s;orrow.</HI> And as God <HI>cur&s;ed the earth</HI> upon this ex|pre&s;s de&s;ign, that it might be adapted to <HI>the&s;e ends,</HI> tis from hence demon&s;trable, that its condition, <HI>before the lap&s;e</HI> (&s;o far as we regard revelation) was not the <HI>&s;ame</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="007634_0006_102D96B48B540A28">
it has been <HI>&s;ince.</HI> If it was, what is the meaning of the <HI>cur&s;e?</HI> What &s;ignification, carrying in it any im|portant &s;en&s;e, can be put upon it?</P>
<P>The plain truth is, We, the <HI>po&s;terity</HI> of <HI>Adam,</HI> come into exi&s;tence &s;ince his lap&s;e, and live on this earth in con&s;equence of it, not as it was in its <HI>pri&s;tine</HI> &s;tate, but as it lies under the <HI>actual cur&s;e</HI> of God, that is, adapted to render life, as long as it la&s;ts, a &s;cene of <HI>labor, vanity,</HI> and <HI>&s;orrow.</HI></P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> certainly viewed the matter in this light. For he &s;ays, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 20, <HI>The creature is made &s;ubject to vanity.</HI> And again, v. 22, <HI>The whole creation groaneth, and travaileth together in pain until now.</HI> And when it is &s;aid, in my text, by the Apo&s;tle <HI>John,</HI> in his de&s;cription of the <HI>re&s;urrection-world,</HI> that <HI>there is no more cur&s;e there,</HI> the propriety of this <HI>cha|racteri&s;tick</HI> is evidently founded on tho&s;e numerous occa&s;ions of <HI>&s;orrow,</HI> mankind, at pre&s;ent, are &s;ubjected to, by rea&s;on of <HI>the cur&s;e that is on the earth.</HI> But if the &s;tate of the <HI>earth now</HI> is, and all along has been, the <HI>&s;ame</HI> it was <HI>before</HI> the fall, how can it be &s;aid to be under a <HI>cur&s;e?</HI> It mu&s;t be a &s;trange &s;ort of <HI>cur&s;e,</HI> that would leave the earth ju&s;t as it found it. It can have no meaning, if it did not &s;o <HI>change the earth</HI> as to make it le&s;s advantagious to man, le&s;s fitted to be a place of happine&s;s. Be&s;ides, if the <HI>cur&s;e</HI> did not greatly change the earth for the <HI>wor&s;e,</HI> how &s;hall we account for tho&s;e &s;cripture pa&s;&s;ages, which &s;peak of the &s;tate of good men, in the <HI>other</HI> world, under the em|blem of a <HI>paradi&s;aick</HI> one? Our Saviour declared to the penitent thief on the cro&s;s, <HI>This day thou &s;halt be with me in paradi&s;e.</HI> The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays of him|&s;elf, <HI>I was caught up to paradi&s;e.</HI> And, in the book of the <HI>revelation,</HI> the promi&s;e to him that overcometh is, that <HI>he &s;hall eat of the tree of life in the mid&s;t of the paradi&s;e of God.</HI> The happy &s;tate de&s;cribed, in
<PB N="9" REF="007634_0007_102D96B79375EB18">
the&s;e texts, under the re&s;emblance of <HI>paradi&s;e,</HI> is, be|yond all controver&s;y, greater than can be enjoyed on this earth, as it is con&s;tituted <HI>at pre&s;ent;</HI> and con&s;e|quently the <HI>ancient paradi&s;e,</HI> from whence the allu&s;ion is borrowed, mu&s;t have been <HI>va&s;tly different</HI> from our <HI>earth,</HI> in its <HI>pre&s;ent condition.</HI> The <HI>ancient paradi&s;e,</HI> it is true, was a particular &s;pot of the earth, &s;elected by God for the habitation of man in <HI>innocency:</HI> But there is no rea&s;on to think, there was any con&s;iderable difference between <HI>that &s;pot</HI> of earth, and the earth <HI>in common.</HI> To be &s;ure, if the <HI>re&s;t</HI> of the earth, in <HI>that day,</HI> was <HI>&s;imilar</HI> to the earth in <HI>this,</HI> there would have been no need of a <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> from God in order to its being an occa&s;ion of <HI>toil</HI> and <HI>&s;orrow.</HI> A meer expul&s;ion from <HI>paradi&s;e</HI> would, in this ca&s;e, have an&s;wered all the ends of the <HI>cur&s;e,</HI> rendering it quite <HI>needle&s;s.</HI> So that it &s;hould &s;eem a point beyond all controver&s;y, among tho&s;e who profe&s;s faith in the revelations of &s;cripture, that <HI>this earth,</HI> by means of the <HI>cur&s;e for Adam's &s;in,</HI> has been changed from its <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;tate; and &s;o changed as to be the unavoidable occa&s;ion of <HI>vanity, labor, &s;orrow,</HI> and <HI>death,</HI> in a multiplied variety of forms, to all who have lived on it &s;ince the lap&s;e.</P>
<P>If any &s;hould here a&s;k, What the change is, in <HI>par|ticular,</HI> that the <HI>cur&s;e</HI> has bro't upon the <HI>earth,</HI> le&s;s fitting it for <HI>happine&s;s,</HI> and more adapting it to be an occa&s;ion of <HI>&s;orrow</HI> and <HI>&s;uffering?</HI></P>
<P>I an&s;wer;&mdash;It &s;eems to me very evident, it is <HI>this</HI> that has changed the <HI>&s;ea&s;ons;</HI> making them, in&s;tead of equable, and gently di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other, &s;ubject to tho&s;e extreams of heat and cold, and &s;udden turns from one to t'other, we now experience, to our being expos'd to manife&s;t inconveniencies, and, many times, great hard&s;hips and &s;ufferings.&mdash;It is <HI>this</HI> that has changed the fitne&s;s of the <HI>ground</HI> for the purpo&s;e of <HI>vegetation;</HI> cau&s;ing it to bring forth its fruit, in all
<PB N="10" REF="007634_0008_102D96B9DA04A500">
its various kinds, with le&s;s perfection, and con&s;equently with le&s;s virtue to nutrifie; which mu&s;t, conformably to the e&s;tabli&s;h'd connections of nature, affect our bodies, rendering them le&s;s perfect, and therefore le&s;s &s;uted to be the in&s;truments of our &s;ouls in the exertment of their &s;everal active pow|ers: Be&s;ides which, it now invigorates tho&s;e <HI>thorns,</HI> and <HI>thi&s;tles,</HI> and <HI>weeds,</HI> which are the occa&s;ion of infi|nite <HI>toil</HI> to the &s;ons of men.&mdash;It is <HI>this</HI> that has chang|ed the <HI>air</HI> from its former purity, &s;ubtilty, and perfect adaptation to the purpo&s;e of breathing, and its other u&s;es in the animal and vegetable kingdom; &s;ubjecting it to tho&s;e &s;teams, exhalations, and heterogeneous mix|tures, which are the cau&s;es, under God, of tho&s;e &s;torms and tempe&s;ts, of tho&s;e thunderings and lightings, of tho&s;e droughts and rains, and, in a word, of tho&s;e vari|ous <HI>pe&s;tilential</HI> affluvia, which has done &s;o much hurt in all ages.&mdash;It is <HI>this</HI> that has filled the <HI>bowels</HI> of the earth with tho&s;e <HI>materials,</HI> whatever they are, that are the <HI>&s;econdary</HI> cau&s;es of that terrible phaenomenon we mean by an <HI>earthquake:</HI> And its bowels, in all its quarters, are &s;tored with the&s;e materials for the pro|duction of this awful event, either for warning, or de|&s;truction, in a le&s;s or greater extent, as God plea&s;es.&mdash;In a word, it is <HI>this</HI> that has &s;o changed the <HI>whole ex|ternal con&s;titution of nature,</HI> as that, in&s;tead of tending to render the earth a <HI>paradi&s;aick</HI> one, it con&s;pires to make it a place of <HI>vanity</HI> and <HI>&s;orrow, &s;uffering</HI> and <HI>death.</HI></P>
<P>One that has wrote a very learned and ingenious Theory of the earth has endeavoured to a&s;&s;ign the <HI>mechanical cau&s;es</HI> of this <HI>change</HI> of the earth from its <HI>paradi&s;aick,</HI> to its <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> &s;tate. I will not affirm, that they are the true ones, of tho&s;e God was plea&s;ed, in fact, to co-operate with in order to effect this change. But thus much I will venture to &s;ay, that <HI>this change,</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="007634_0009_102D96BB6D5FCC88">
as owing to <HI>the&s;e cau&s;es,</HI> is both intelligible, and credi|ble, upon the &s;tricte&s;t phylo&s;ophical rea&s;oning; and that we have therefrom a clear and ju&s;t account, how the <HI>cur&s;e,</HI> the &s;cripture &s;peaks of, <HI>might</HI> come upon the <HI>earth</HI> in con&s;equence of the &s;in of the fir&s;t parents of men, and <HI>change</HI> it from its former &s;tate; making it, in the natural cour&s;e of things, an occa&s;ion of all tho&s;e <HI>inconveniencies, difficulties, fears, &s;orrows, &s;uffer|ings,</HI> and <HI>deaths,</HI> we are now &s;ubjected to, and &s;o ear|ne&s;tly groan to be delivered from.</P>
<P>I may pertinently add here, it is highly probable, that the alwi&s;e righteous God &s;o adju&s;ted all <HI>&s;econd Cau&s;es,</HI> when, by his <HI>cur&s;e</HI> he changed the external &s;tate of nature, as that they &s;hould operate, in all ages, and in all places, as might be&s;t an&s;wer his de&s;igns in the <HI>moral</HI> government of the creature. What I mean is, He might &s;ettle &s;uch <HI>laws</HI> with re&s;pect to natural cau&s;es, &s;o proportion their force, &s;phere of action, man|ner and degree of operation, as that, under his all-powerful and alwi&s;e concurring influence, they &s;hould con&s;pire together to produce tho&s;e effects, at &s;uch times, and in &s;uch places, as were be&s;t fitted to their moral &s;tate, and might &s;erve for warning and correction, or total de&s;olation and ruin, as he &s;hould judge expedient. And in con&s;equence of this &s;ettlement of the cour&s;e of nature, taking ri&s;e from the &s;in of the <HI>one man Adam,</HI> it may come to pa&s;s, that his <HI>po&s;terity,</HI> in all after-ages, as they for&s;ake God, are involved in tho&s;e calamities, which either warn and di&s;cipline them, or totally de|&s;troy them from off the face of the earth, as the ends of government make the one, or the other, fit and proper.</P>
<P>We &s;ee, in fact, that the heavens over us, and the earth under us, are charged with <HI>materials</HI> that are fitted, whenever God plea&s;es, in a variety of ways, to awaken the attention of a carele&s;s world, and call them
<PB N="12" REF="007634_0010_102D96BDF3E1A1A8">
to the faith, and fear, and &s;ervice of the great &s;ove|reign of the univer&s;e; or to put a period to their ex|i&s;tence here, if they are incurably turned to infidelity and wickedne&s;s. It is from the&s;e materials in nature, that <HI>tempe&s;ts, famines, pe&s;tilences, earthquakes,</HI> and the like, take their ri&s;e. And the&s;e are the <HI>great in&s;tru|ments</HI> of providence. It is by the&s;e, that God keeps our degenerate world under re&s;traint. Were it not for the di&s;plays he makes, at proper times, and in pro|per places, of his being, and perfection, and governing providence, in the&s;e ways of terror, mankind might, at length, forget there was a God, or live as tho' there was none.</P>
<P>The <HI>final cau&s;e</HI> therefore of God's <HI>cur&s;ing the earth,</HI> and fitting it for the production of &s;o much evil, in the cour&s;e of providence, might be the <HI>good</HI> of mankind. Such a world as this <HI>now</HI> is, and by the <HI>cur&s;e</HI> of God too, may be the mo&s;t <HI>&s;utable</HI> one for &s;uch creatures as we are &s;ince the lap&s;e: Had the earth remained in its <HI>paradi&s;aick</HI> &s;tate, giving no room to expect <HI>death,</HI> or tho&s;e occa&s;ions of &s;orrow, and fear, and &s;uffering, we are now &s;ubjected to, it might have been an abode altogether unadapted to the bu&s;ine&s;s of training us up for the enjoyment of God, the &s;upreme Good. It was, perhaps, highly expedient, if not ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary, that we &s;hould live in a world of <HI>di&s;cipline;</HI> a world that would, in the natural cour&s;e of things, be the occa&s;ion of many difficulties, inconveniencies, and tryals, by means of which, we might be formed to a meekne&s;s for <HI>another</HI> world, in which we &s;hould be totally freed from them. An interrupted &s;tate of ea&s;e and plea&s;ure would, morally &s;peaking, be the ruin of mankind. We need a mixture of <HI>evil</HI> with good, to check our pride; to re&s;train our bodily appetites; to take off our affections from the things of the earth; and to excite in us a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of our dependence on
<PB N="13" REF="007634_0011_102D96C09FF5BF58">
God. And we need al&s;o, every now and then, to be alarmed by this or that di&s;pen&s;ation, that &s;hall &s;peak with a voice more loud and awful than is common and ordinary. The inhabitants of the world in general, and the inhabitants in this or the other place in &s;pecial, are &s;ometimes &s;unk into a &s;tate of &s;uch carele&s;sne&s;s and &s;tupidity, have &s;o little faith in God, and are &s;o given up to commit all iniquity with greedine&s;s, that, humanly &s;peaking, there is no room to expect their reformation and amendment, but by &s;uch manife&s;tations of the power, and greatne&s;s, and maje&s;ty of God, as will even force a faith in him, and a &s;erious attention to his cha|racter as the moral governor of the world.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the <HI>cour&s;e of nature,</HI> &s;ince the <HI>lap&s;e,</HI> and in con&s;equence of it, is wi&s;ely and mercifully a|dapted to both the&s;e ends: Giving occa&s;ion, at all times, for di&s;ciplinary tryals; and bringing on al&s;o, at certain intervals, &s;uch tremendous events as either alarm the fears of men, and &s;olemnly call them to repentance, or de&s;troy them from off the earth by hundreds and thou|&s;ands, having filled up the mea&s;ure of their iniquities. And this <HI>cour&s;e of nature</HI> will continue, and operate to the&s;e ends, producing both <HI>ordinary</HI> and <HI>extraordinary</HI> evils, more or le&s;s exten&s;ive and fatal, as the &s;tate of mankind &s;hall make them nece&s;&s;ary, till the world is ripe for that <HI>di&s;&s;olution by fire,</HI> of which we are parti|cularly forewarned by the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> in the 3^d <HI>chapter</HI> of his 2^d <HI>epi&s;tle;</HI> the provi&s;ions for which were all, doubtle&s;s, laid in &s;tore, when God cur&s;ed the earth, and &s;o adju&s;ted, as that they &s;hould all unite and ope|rate at the time &s;et therefor in the coun&s;els of God: Tho' it ought to be remembered here, the <HI>fire</HI> of this Day of God's wrath, which is re&s;erved for the perdi|tion of ungodly men, will be &s;o far from finally ruining this world, as that it &s;hall be a <HI>mean,</HI> under the govern|ment of the all-powerful and all-wi&s;e God, of taking
<PB N="14" REF="007634_0012_102D96C268A797C0">
off the <HI>cur&s;e</HI> from the earth, and reducing it to its <HI>para|di&s;aick</HI> &s;tate, or one that is much better.</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed be God, we have good rea&s;on from the <HI>re|velations</HI> of his word, to expect <HI>&s;uch a &s;tate</HI> as this; tho' the pre&s;ent <HI>heaven</HI> and <HI>earth</HI> &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved by the fire of the great day. Our Saviour, &s;peaking of tho&s;e who had followed him, &s;ays, that, <HI>in the regeneration, they &s;hall &s;et upon twelve thrones,</HI> Matt. 19. 28. The word here tran&s;lated <HI>regeneration,</HI> is the very one (as Dr. <HI>Burnet</HI> ob&s;erves) that is u&s;ed, both by the <HI>greek philosophers,</HI> and the <HI>greek chri&s;tian fathers,</HI> for the <HI>renovation of the world.</HI> And, doubtle&s;s, the <HI>new form of exi&s;tence</HI> that is to be given to all things, their being, as it were, <HI>born again</HI> to another and better &s;tate, is what our &s;aviour has here in view. In the <HI>Acts</HI> of the Apo&s;tles, chapter 3. ver. 21, <HI>The heaven is &s;aid to</HI> receive <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> UNTIL THE TIMES OF THE RESTITUTION OF ALL THINGS. The Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> in agreement with this tho't, be&s;peaks the chri&s;tians he wrote to in &s;uch language as that, 2 <HI>Epi&s;tle,</HI> 3 chap. ver. 13, <HI>We, according to his promi&s;e, look for new heavens, and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> The Apo|&s;tle <HI>John</HI> al&s;o, in his vi&s;ion, &s;aw this pre&s;ent <HI>earth and heavens, flee away,</HI> &s;o as that <HI>there was no more place found for them,</HI> Rev. 20. 11. And when the earth and heavens, that now are, were pa&s;&s;ed away, he <HI>&s;aw a new heavens, and a new earth,</HI> ri&s;e up in their room, <HI>Chap.</HI> 21. 1. And it is in con&s;equence of the&s;e vi&s;ions, that he introduces <HI>him that &s;at on the throne,</HI> &s;aying, as in the 5th ver. of this chapter, <HI>Behold, I make all things new.</HI></P>
<P>Some have tho't, that the&s;e <HI>new heavens and earth</HI> will be formed before the <HI>general re&s;urrection</HI> and <HI>judgment;</HI> but 'tis with me beyond all doubt, that they are herein mi&s;taken. For the di&s;&s;olution of the pre&s;ent earth and heavens, which the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> &s;peaks of;
<PB N="15" REF="007634_0013_102D96C636172B00">
and the pa&s;&s;ing away of the earth and heavens, which is &s;poken of by the Apo&s;tle <HI>John,</HI> mean one and the &s;ame thing. And tis remarkable, the Apo&s;tle <HI>John &s;aw the dead, both &s;mall and great, ari&s;e, and come forth to judgment,</HI> before he &s;aw the erection of a <HI>new earth</HI> and <HI>heavens,</HI> in the room of the old which had pa&s;&s;ed away.</P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem therefore very plain, that the <HI>new heavens</HI> and <HI>new earth,</HI> &s;o particularly &s;poken of, both by the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> and the Apo&s;tle <HI>John,</HI> are <HI>this world of our's</HI> bro't back to its <HI>paradi&s;aick</HI> &s;tate, or one that is better; and that the <HI>very world we now live in,</HI> thus changed and made new, is the place, where good men, after the re&s;urrection, and judgment, &s;hall live and reign with Chri&s;t forever and ever.</P>
<P>And in truth, where el&s;e &s;hould be the <HI>place</HI> of the abode of good men, in the <HI>re&s;urrection</HI>-&s;tate? As one expre&s;&s;es it, <Q>In the boundle&s;s &s;pace that &s;urrounds us, we know of nothing but &s;uns, or fixed &s;tars, earths, and moons, and comets. Neither of the&s;e, except the earths, can be tho't fit to be the habitation of good men in the future &s;tate. In &s;uch a place, in the <HI>new earth,</HI> the Apo&s;tles <HI>Peter,</HI> and <HI>John</HI> &s;ay, good men &s;hall dwell. Why then &s;hould we &s;eek for another unknown place, of which the &s;cripture never &s;peaks.</Q><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr.<HI>Jo&s;eph Hallet,</HI> from whom the above pa&s;&s;age is cited, makes the following Ob&s;ervation, which may be worthy of notice. <Q>The word, <HI>Heaven,</HI> never once in all the bible &s;ignifies the place in which good men &s;hall dwell <HI>after</HI> the judgment-day. I venture, &s;ays he&punc; to be pretty po&s;itive in a&s;&s;erting this, becau&s;e I have examin'd every place in the <HI>new-te&s;tament,</HI> in which <HI>Heaven</HI> is mentioned, with a view to this. The word, <HI>Hea|ven,</HI> in &s;cripture &s;ignifies the throne of God, the place where Chri&s;t <HI>now</HI> is, where angels, and &s;pirits of ju&s;t men, <HI>now</HI> dwell. When the Apo&s;tles &s;peak of good men, <HI>after</HI> the day of judgment, they never call it <HI>Heaven;</HI> but the <HI>holy city,</HI> the <HI>new Jeru&s;alem, eternal life, glory, honor, im|mortality,</HI> a <HI>crown, a Kingdom,</HI> and the like.</Q> <HI>Notes on peculiar texts,</HI> Vol. I. pag. 198.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erves likewi&s;e, <Q>That the <HI>new Jeru&s;alem,</HI> the <HI>holy city,</HI> [the <HI>pre&s;ent heaven</HI> of good men] &s;hall come down up the <HI>new earth.</HI> Rev. xxi. 2, 10. <HI>I John &s;aw the holy city, new jeru&s;alem, coming down from God out of heaven</HI>&mdash;<HI>He &s;hewed me the great city, the holy jeru&s;alem, coming down from God out of heaven.</HI> Agreeable to this account are many other places of &s;cripture; as 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 1. The hou&s;e not made with hands, in which good men &s;hall dwell, is, at pre&s;ent, in the <HI>heavens;</HI> but hereafter it &s;hall be an hou&s;e <HI>from heaven,</HI> v. 2, i. e. it &s;hall come down from heaven. The hope of chri&s;tians is, at pre&s;ent, laid up in <HI>heaven,</HI> Col. i. 5. Their inheritance is, at pre&s;ent, re&s;erved in <HI>heaven,</HI> 1 Pet. i. 4. They have an enduring &s;ub&s;tance now in <HI>heaven,</HI> Heb. x. 34. Their Trea&s;ure is, at pre&s;ent, in <HI>heaven,</HI> Matt. vi. 20. The place prepared for them is now in <HI>heaven,</HI> Joh. xiv. 2. This hou&s;e, this hope, this inheritance, this &s;ub&s;tance, this trea&s;ure, this place are in the <HI>new jeru&s;alem.</HI> And as the <HI>new jeru|&s;alem</HI> is in <HI>heaven,</HI> the&s;e things cannot but be there too. But <HI>hereafter,</HI> when the <HI>new jeru&s;alem</HI> &s;hall come down <HI>from heaven</HI> upon the <HI>new earth,</HI> then the&s;e things &s;hall come down in and with it. St. <HI>John</HI> is not peculiar in repre&s;enting the place of good men's habitation in the other world as a city. St. <HI>Paul</HI> has frequently done the &s;ame; as in <HI>Heb.</HI> xi. 10, and 16. <HI>Heb.</HI> xiii. 14. St. <HI>Paul</HI> al&s;o agrees with St. <HI>John</HI> as to the <HI>name</HI> of this city, the <HI>heavenly jeru&s;alem,</HI> Heb. xii. 22. Both St. <HI>John</HI> and St. <HI>Paul</HI> call it a <HI>city,</HI> and <HI>jeru&s;alem;</HI> and both &s;ay, that though it be <HI>now</HI> in heaven, it &s;hall <HI>hereafter</HI> come down from heaven.</Q> Vol. ibid.

<P>But be the <HI>place</HI> of the abode of good men, after the re&s;urrection, where it will, whether on <HI>this earth made new,</HI> or any other globe in heaven, that is one of the e&s;&s;ential <HI>characteri&s;ticks</HI> of it, <HI>No cur&s;e &s;hall be there.</HI></P>

<P>Our life on earth, in con&s;equence of the cur&s;e, is a continual labor; the bu&s;ine&s;s of it, in great part, <HI>a

The con&s;titution of things there is &s;uch, as that they will no more have occa&s;ion for food, or raiment, or habitations. They &s;hall hunger no more, neither thir&s;t any more; neither &s;hall the &s;un light on them, or any heat, or cold, or &s;torm; for the&s;e, and all &s;uch occa&s;ions of anxious thoughtfulne&s;s, and toil|&s;ome care, are removed away.</P>
<P>Our bodies, &s;ince the <HI>lap&s;e,</HI> and the <HI>cur&s;e</HI> in con&s;e|quence of it, are liable to weakne&s;s and wearine&s;s, to di&s;ea&s;es and pains, to accidents and harms; and, at length, mu&s;t, in one way or another, be de&s;troyed by death. But, in the re&s;urrection world, there is neither &s;orrow nor pain: Neither &s;hall there be any more death. Our corruption &s;hall put on incorruption, our mortal &s;hall put on immortality, and death be &s;wallowed up of life.</P>
<P>The earth we now live upon is, by the <HI>cur&s;e,</HI> be|come a place of di&s;cipline and tryal; giving frequent opportunity for the excitement and exerci&s;e of pa|tience, &s;elf-denial, &s;ilence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the &s;ove|reign plea&s;ure of God. But good men, in the re&s;ur|rection world, &s;hall be no more &s;ubjected to any tryals of this kind. Their warfare is accompli&s;hed, their time of di&s;cipline is over; and they are now in a world which is &s;o form'd, as to give no more occa&s;ion for ever for any inconvenience, for any &s;uffering, in any kind or degree, to try their faith and patience.</P>
<P>The earth, by the <HI>cur&s;e,</HI> has been furni&s;hed with materials to produce tho&s;e events, which are fitted to alarm our fears, and awaken us to call on God; or,

if we are obdurate and incorrigible, to puni&s;h us with &s;udden and awful de&s;truction.

<P>In a word, good men, in the re&s;urrection-world, &s;hall neither feel nor fear evil any more.

For it was this that bro't down a <HI>cur&s;e</HI> from God, that changed the earth from the <HI>&s;tate</HI> in which it was created, to <HI>that</HI> which has fitted it to be an occa&s;ion of much tryal and &s;orrow to the &s;ons of men ever &s;ince. Ab&s;tracted from tho&s;e inconveniencies and &s;ufferings, which are owing to the per&s;onal vices of mankind, there are others, and many too, that are unavoidable from the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of nature. Toil, &s;ickne&s;s, and death, in a variety of forms, we are all &s;ubjected to, be our per&s;onal character what it will. And the&s;e evils are a &s;tanding demon&s;tration of the great guilt of the fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; for they took ri&s;e from it, and are the effect of the cur&s;e of God for it. And it might be an in&s;tance, not only of ju&s;tice, but of wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s in God, thus to te&s;tify again&s;t this &s;in; for the evil effects occa&s;ioned by it may rea&s;onably be looked upon as &s;o many <HI>moral admonitions,</HI> in the go|vernment of providence, powerfully fitted to teach mankind the nece&s;&s;ity of an <HI>obediential regard</HI> to the authority of him, who is our Law-giver, King &amp; Judge.</P>

judgment. Thus he has done all along from the beginning of the world. Which of tho&s;e calamitous evils, nature is endow'd with a power, under the divine direction, to bring upon &s;inful nations, and provinces, and cities, have not in fact been bro't upon them?

may be a more <HI>immediate</HI> warning to the <HI>nation</HI> of which it is a part, and to the <HI>nations round about,</HI> call|ing upon them to give glory to the &s;upreme Governor of the world, by repenting of their &s;ins: But it may rea&s;onably be looked upon as a <HI>call</HI> to us al&s;o; and the rather, as we were vi&s;ited in the &s;ame month, by a like <HI>&s;haking of the earth,</HI> and to a more terrible degree than was ever known in the country before. Surely, the voice of providence loudly be&s;peaks us, in the lan|guage of our Saviour to the men of Jeru&s;alem, upon occa&s;ion of the de&s;truction of a number of them, by the falling of the tower of <HI>Siloam, except ye repent, ye &s;hall all likewi&s;e peri&s;h.</HI> What rea&s;on have we to expect any other? Don't we de&s;erve a like de&s;tructi|on? We are certainly a very &s;inful people. Our ini|quities are increa&s;ed over our heads, and our tre&s;pa&s;&s;es have reached unto the heavens. And how &s;oon they may pull down the divine vengeance upon us, we know not. God has other judgments be&s;ides that of an <HI>earth|quake.</HI>

And if he &s;hould not de&s;troy us in <HI>this way,</HI> he may in &s;ome other. And how far he may make u&s;e of our <HI>French</HI> neighbours, and the <HI>Indian-natives</HI> in their intere&s;t, to impoveri&s;h, weaken, and gradually depopulate us, is more than we can any of us &s;ay at pre&s;ent. The face of our affairs, in military re&s;pects, looks dark. What a va&s;t &s;um of national money has been wor&s;e than thrown away upon the <HI>&s;outhern</HI> expe|dition, as it has turned out a fruitle&s;s one? Nor is this the wor&s;t of that unhappy enterpri&s;e. The horrible &s;laughter of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> troops, near the <HI>Monongehala,</HI> and the &s;hameful <HI>defeat</HI> occa&s;ioned thereby, has expo&s;ed the <HI>&s;outhern</HI> colonies to more and greater barbarities, within a few months, than from their fir&s;t &s;ettlement to this day.&mdash;And what have we, in <HI>New-England,</HI> got by our <HI>Crown-point-expedition?</HI> Our troops, it is owned, have gained, under the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven, a glorious victory over a numerous army of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> near <HI>Lake-George.</HI> But then, it mu&s;t be added, this victory was far le&s;s glorious than it would have been, humanly &s;peaking, if it had been wi&s;ely and re&s;olutely pur&s;ued. Why it was not, is matter of ju&s;t wonder! E&s;pe|cially to tho&s;e who have heard, that the <HI>private &s;oldiers</HI> would gladly have pur&s;ued, but were re&s;trained. And it mu&s;t be added yet further, there would have been no opportunity for gaining even this le&s;s glorious vic|tory, had it not been for that over-ruling providence of God, which brings things to pa&s;s beyond the de&s;ign of man. It was not by <HI>our coun&s;el,</HI> but by the enemy's thru&s;ting them&s;elves in our way, that this battle was fought; and had it not been for their <HI>officiou&s;ne&s;s</HI> in coming to us, it <HI>now</HI> appears that our army would have been disbanded without doing any thing worth menti|oning. Tis certain, notwith&s;tanding the advantage gained again&s;t them, our troops were never carried one &s;tep further towards <HI>Fort-Frederick;</HI> and tis as certain,
<PB N="24" REF="007634_0022_102D96DF507BE8E0">
that the <HI>true de&s;ign</HI> of the <HI>New-England-Governments,</HI> in rai&s;ing, and &s;ending, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting &s;o great an arma|ment, was thereby <HI>intirely defeated:</HI> And the defeat is followed with a burden of charge very grievous to bear; and the more &s;o, as we are in far wor&s;e circum|&s;tances, with re&s;pect to the taking of this place, than before we were involved in this heavy charge, which now lies upon us as a <HI>dead weight</HI> we groan to be de|livered from. What future expeditions may be pro|jected, or how they will be managed, mu&s;t be left to time to di&s;cover: But it is, at pre&s;ent, manife&s;t, that we are under the &s;courge of God, and loudly called upon to con&s;ider our ways, and repent, and reform: And till we are bro't to this, we lie continually expo&s;ed, not only to this rod of his anger, but to all the judg|ments this Earth is capable of being u&s;ed as the <HI>&s;econ|dary cau&s;e,</HI> under God, of bringing upon us. The plain truth is, there is no &s;afety, no &s;ecurity for us, whether as particular per&s;ons, or a people, on this earth, which, by the <HI>cur&s;e,</HI> is &s;tored, in all places, with materials for correction, or de&s;truction, as God plea&s;es, but by making him our friend thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t; which can't be done but by putting away our iniquities, or in other words, by getting that <HI>moral change</HI> introduced in us, which will render us <HI>meet objects</HI> of the divine fa|favor: And we &s;hould make ha&s;te, and delay not, in &s;o intere&s;ting and important a matter.</P>
<P N="3">3. What has been di&s;cour&s;ed opens to our view the <HI>folly</HI> of tho&s;e who <HI>depend on this world for happine&s;s.</HI> Thus it is with a great many. This world is the chief object of their de&s;ire, and pur&s;uit. It engro&s;&s;es their affections, and engages all their endeavours. They look for happine&s;s from earthly good things; imagining they might &s;it down contented and &s;atisfied, could they once come to the obtainment of them. But they are herein chargeable with great folly. For the
<PB N="25" REF="007634_0023_102D96E2D05F2D68">
world we live in is not, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, fitted to be a place of happine&s;s; and this we know, or ea&s;ily may know, from ob&s;ervation and experience in thou|&s;ands of in&s;tances. Who indeed, among the multitudes, that have &s;earched for happine&s;s among the things under the &s;un, have ever found it? Not a &s;ingle man! No one, perhaps, that ever lived was better qualified, or &s;ituated, for &s;uch a &s;earch than <HI>Solomon,</HI> the &s;on of David, and King over I&s;rael; and yet, after all his &s;earches and re&s;earches, and this among all the objects of earthly plea&s;ure and delight, that is his conclu&s;ion, <HI>Behold, all is vanity, and vexation of &s;pirit, and there is no profit under the &s;un,</HI> Eccle&s;. 2. 11. And we may depend, tis a ju&s;t determination upon the ca&s;e. Mo&s;t men indeed are di&s;pos'd to imagine otherwi&s;e. In&s;tead of tru&s;ting to <HI>Solomon</HI>'s experience, they are for making tryal them&s;elves; hoping that they &s;hall meet with happine&s;s, tho' he fail'd in the attempt. And how often, from this vain expectation, have the &s;ame ex|periments been repeated over and over again, in pro|portion to men's advantages and opportunities? And what has been the effect? They have always ended in emptine&s;s and di&s;appointment. And how could it po&s;&s;ibly have been otherwi&s;e, when the earth they live upon is under a <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> from heaven, which has fitted it to be an occa&s;ion of <HI>toil</HI> and <HI>&s;orrow,</HI> in numberle&s;s ca&s;es? The &s;hort of the matter is, God never intend|ed that this world, &s;ince the lap&s;e, &s;hould be capable of yielding plea&s;ure without pain, good without the mixture of evil. The pre&s;ent con&s;titution of nature is incompatible with unmingled happine&s;s; and if any look for the enjoyment of &s;uch happine&s;s, they do but deceive tham&s;elves: they imagine a vain thing; and will &s;urely meet with di&s;appointment. The pre&s;ent heaven &amp; earth mu&s;t pa&s;s away, and a new heaven and earth ri&s;e up in their room, before any &s;on or daugh|ter
<PB N="26" REF="007634_0024_102D96E5099E6ED0">
of <HI>Adam</HI> can po&s;&s;e&s;s life without pa&s;&s;ing through a multiplied variety of inconveniencies, di&s;appointments, vexations, and &s;orrows, all trying to their patience, and not to be endured without greatly alloying their comforts in other re&s;pects.</P>
<P>And tis be&s;t it &s;hould be thus. In&s;tead of com|plaining again&s;t God for mixing &s;o many grievances with every &s;tate of life we can be in, we have rea&s;on rather to thank him for his <HI>wi&s;e goodne&s;s.</HI> For here|by the temptations that may ari&s;e from worldly good things are le&s;&s;ened in their &s;trength, and our danger of being ruined by being too much attached to them, in the &s;ame proportion, prevented. We are, in this pre|&s;ent &s;tate, under di&s;cipline, in a &s;chool, as it were, to be trained up for another and better world: And it is for our real benefit, that this earth, and the things of it, are no more tempting to us. We &s;hould &s;ay within our&s;elves, were that the ca&s;e, it is good to be always here; and the hazard would be awfully great, le&s;t our ruin would thereby be procured.</P>
<P N="4">4. We are directed, from what has been &s;aid, where to look for happine&s;s, if we would not be di&s;appointed, namely, in the <HI>re&s;urrection-world;</HI> in which there are none of tho&s;e occa&s;ions of fear and di&s;tre&s;s, which now di&s;turb our grief, and try our patience. Ble&s;&s;ed be God, &s;uch a world as this is opened to our view in the Go&s;pel, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t; a world of freedom from toil and &s;orrow; a world in which there is neither &s;in, nor pain, nor death; a world in which there &s;hall be no more any &s;ighing or tears, but unmixed joys ever flowing from the right hand of God. Let us then give up all hope of happine&s;s from this earth, or any thing in it; extending our views beyond the grave to the <HI>re&s;urrection-world,</HI> as the only one that is &s;uted to yield us intire &s;atisfaction and delight. This is what we mu&s;t come to fir&s;t or la&s;t, if we would not be
<PB N="27" REF="007634_0025_102D96E6B72B90D0">
fru&s;trated in our expectations. For &s;olid and compleat happine&s;s is to be had no where el&s;e. We may ima|gine otherwi&s;e, and &s;eek for it in this or the other earthly enjoyment; but we &s;hall certainly meet with di&s;appointment. They will all &s;ay, upon tryal, it is not in us: Neither is it to be found any where but in that world, concerning which my text &s;ays, <HI>there is no Cur&s;e there.</HI></P>
<P>What therefore remains, as the conclu&s;ion of all, but that we &s;o live in this <HI>pre&s;ent &s;tate,</HI> as that we may <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> fail of being happy in that which is to come. In order whereto, we mu&s;t moderate our regard to earthly things, and keep our de&s;ires, hopes, and pur&s;uits, with reference to them, under the re&s;traints of rea&s;on and religion. If we &s;eek the Things that are on the earth, it mu&s;t be in due &s;ubordination to the greater Things that are above. The <HI>better country,</HI> even the <HI>heavenly,</HI> &s;hould be principally in our eye; and the good things of it &s;hould have the fir&s;t place in our hearts. We &s;hould make them the chief objects of our hopes and pur&s;uits. And as there is no way in which we can be &s;ecure of an intere&s;t in them, but by doing the will of God, his will which requires faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; his will which requires our &s;anctification in &s;pirit, &s;oul, and body; his will which requires our active obedience to the precepts of his word, and a pa|tient &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the di&s;po&s;als of his hand: I &s;ay, as the only way to obtain the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the <HI>re&s;urrec|tion</HI>-world is by thus doing the will of God, this mu&s;t be the great bu&s;ine&s;s of our lives. And if we frame our hearts, and order our conver&s;ation, by this rule of duty, we &s;hall not fail of compleat &s;atisfaction, perfect happine&s;s, in the end.</P>
<P>We may, while in this world, have our <HI>evil things.</HI> They are, indeed, unavoidable attendants on us here. There is no living in a world, con&s;tituted as this is,
<PB N="28" REF="007634_0026_102D7220837FDFC0">
without &s;ufferings of one kind or another, in a le&s;s or greater degree. The greate&s;t holine&s;s we can attain to won't &s;ecure us from them: Nay, as we live in a world that <HI>lies in wickedne&s;s,</HI> we may be <HI>&s;ufferers,</HI> even, by tho&s;e tremendous judgments of God, that are &s;ent upon the earth, in te&s;timony of his ju&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t the &s;ins that are committed in it. But we have no rea&s;on for di&s;quietude, be the evils, ordinary or extra|ordinary, what they will, we are called to &s;uffer. For our <HI>hope</HI> is not here, but <HI>within the vail, whither the fore-runner is for us entered, even Je&s;us our high-prie&s;t;</HI> which <HI>hope</HI> &s;hould be as <HI>the anchor of our &s;ouls,</HI> to keep us &s;teady amid&s;t all the &s;torms of fear and trou|ble we may be expo&s;ed to in this tempe&s;tuous world. The utmo&s;t that pre&s;ent evils can do, be the terror they are accompanied with what it will, is to kill our bodies, and &s;end our &s;ouls into another &s;tate. And why &s;hould we be anxiou&s;ly concerned about this? Is not this <HI>other &s;tate</HI> the great object of our faith, and hope, and de|&s;ire? Can we be happy till we arrive at the <HI>Jeru&s;alem that is above,</HI> this <HI>city that has foundations, who&s;e build|er and maker is God?</HI></P>
<P>Let us, my brethren, make religion the <HI>grand care</HI> of our lives, and we need not di&s;tre&s;s our&s;elves about any of the events of time; for they &s;hall all work together for our good; and tho' not joyous for the pre&s;ent, but grievous, they &s;hall in the end, yield unto us the peaceable fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s. For it is a Go&s;pel &s;aying, and a faithful one, <HI>if we &s;uffer with Chri&s;t here, we &s;hall reign with him hereafter.</HI> The tryal of our faith and patience, being like that of gold which is tried in the fire, &s;hall be found to prai&s;e, and honor, and glory, at the appearing of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; for we &s;hall then receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promi&s;ed to them that love him: And this crown will be bright &amp; weighty, in proportion to the &s;orrows and &s;ufferings we have been called to, and have born with humility, meekne&s;s, &s;ilence, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the alwi&s;e righteous Governor of the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>Let us comfort our&s;elves, and one another, with the&s;e ble&s;&s;ed hopes, that are opened to our view in the revelations of God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to whom be glory in the Church, throughout all ages.</P>
