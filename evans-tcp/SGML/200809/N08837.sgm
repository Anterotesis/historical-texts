<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> Take no plea&s;ure in noi&s;y controver&s;ies and contentious di&s;putes, neither will I be engaged in any &s;uch. Matters which have any relation to the kingdom of God, which is the dominion of truth, righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace, ought to be di&s;|cour&s;ed with great fairne&s;s, calmne&s;s and equity.</P>
<P>I hope no envy towards any man, nor the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ition to le&s;&s;en the ju&s;t reputation, and fully the honor of any of my brethren in the mini&s;try; but &s;hould rejoice to &s;ee them all, by a clear mani|fe&s;tation of the truth, and calm, con&s;i&s;tent te&s;ti|mony again&s;t hurtful errors, commend them&s;elves, throughout, to every man's con&s;cience in the &s;ight of God. I have no quarrel again&s;t any of the gentlemen, &s;ome of who&s;e &s;entiments are remarked upon in the following dialogue, nor will I.</P>
<P>'Tis error, hurtful error that I cen&s;ure and contend again&s;t, not men. Such gentlemen as have di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of honor conferred on them by public &s;ocieties, I would willingly, as is fit, give honor to: But then they are expected to do more than barely to &s;hew the feathers in their
<PB N="4" REF="011285_0003_0F869C5219A4DD78">
caps; they mu&s;t &s;hew them&s;elves worthy of them. It is doing &s;uch too great honor, to connive at errors becau&s;e they embrace and teach them.</P>
<P>Hurtful errors ought to have no &s;anctuary; not to be protected from ju&s;t cen&s;ure, under the covert of a bi&s;hop's gown nor even under the &s;ha|dow of the throne; for they are laid under cen|&s;ure by a ju&s;t &s;entence given from the &s;upreme throne. And it is too dangerous to countenance what God has condemned, and contradict what he has &s;aid.</P>
<P>The following dialogue has been &s;hewn to mo&s;t of the gentlemen in the mini&s;try, in my neigh|bourhood, who have given it me as their opinion, that it is nece&s;&s;ary to hear a public te&s;timony again&s;t the dangerous errors which are &s;preading among our churches, and that the following te&s;timony is &s;o calulcated to &s;erve the intere&s;t of truth, that it will be for the edification of the churches to publi&s;h it. And as no public te&s;timony is prepa|ring, at pre&s;ent, again&s;t a mo&s;t de&s;tructive &s;cheme of fal&s;e doctrines, breaking in upon us as a flood, that I know of, I pre&s;ent this to the public; de&s;iring all to whom it may come, calmly and im|partially to weigh the things which are offered to their con&s;ideration, by</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>A Clergyman and a Gentleman of the Laity, his acquaintance and friend, being in company to|gether the other day, their conver&s;ation, by in&s;en&s;ible &s;teps, led them into the following DIALOGUE.</HI></HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GENTLEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I HAVE ob&s;erved, &s;ir, that you gentlemen of the cler|gy, though you differ in &s;entiments from one ano|ther, yet all claim to your&s;elves the honor of being orthodox; and the &s;ame man, tho' he differs from him&s;elf in different &s;tages of his life, yea, and even at the &s;ame time, and in the &s;ame di&s;cour&s;e, yet is orthodox &s;till, and incon&s;i&s;tent and contrary propo&s;itions are &s;ound doctrine. How is this to be accounted for; Does orthodoxy follow the motions of the clergy, as the &s;hadow upon the dial does that of the fun? And when your motions are retro|gade, does orthodoxy go backward like the &s;hadow upon the dial of <HI>Abaz</HI>?</P>

<SPEAKER>CLERGYMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU are merry upon us, &s;ir. But we are agreed in this, that true orthodoxy is a fixed thing, and that the holy &s;criptures are the only true rule of faith, and &s;tandard by which doctrines of religion are to be tried, and determined to be orthodox or not. We may po&s;&s;ibly differ in our under&s;tanding of the &s;en&s;e of the &s;criptures, in &s;ome things. So do the gentlemen, and judges of the law in their in|terpretations of the law, in &s;ome particulars. But it don't at all follow from thence, that true orthodoxy, either in law or divinity, is a wavering or uncertain thing: it only &s;hews that men are fallible. We may po&s;&s;ibly err in &s;ome things, in our profe&s;&s;ion, as well as the be&s;t of men in other profe&s;&s;ions; but I hope we don't willingly err from the truth in any thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad, &s;ir, to find your thoughts &s;o ju&s;t: But I believe it is a pretty difficult thing, for men who are teachers of others by office, and have pre&s;ided in the church a num|ber of years, to be <HI>them&s;elves, perfectly teachable.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>CLERG.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is indeed fo: and if we are not truly humble we &s;hall not be &s;o. If the defire of worldly honor and pre-eminence, and love of the prai&s;e of men prevails in us above the de&s;ire of plea&s;ing God, and being approved by our great ma&s;ter, we &s;hall become ob&s;tinate in
<PB N="7" REF="011285_0006_0F869C5590984E68">
defending our own unhappy mi&s;takes, and &s;ooner run into two popular errors than ac|knowlege one. However, we ought all of us, to &s;it at the feet of Je&s;us with as much humi|lity and meek teachablene&s;s as the lea&s;t of our hearers, that we may hear and learn of him, and be corrected by him, wherein we have un|happily erred from his truth, and willingly receive his corrections of our errors, by who|&s;oever hands they are mini&s;tred to us.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am right well plea&s;ed with your mode&s;t and ju&s;t &s;entiments; and wi&s;h all the gentlemen of your order, throughout the chri|&s;tian world, had them written on their hearts.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Under the influence of the&s;e tho'ts, and in your pre&s;ent temper of mind, I believe you will be an impartial examiner, and ju&s;tly cen&s;ure &s;uch errors in religion as de&s;erve cen&s;ure. I will therefore, if it be agreable to you, &s;ir, mention to you &s;everal things which I have collected out of &s;undry di&s;cour&s;es of &s;e|veral of our clergy, which have been lately publi&s;hed, which appear to me very wrong, and of very evil tendency; &s;ome of which are, I think, nearly related to <HI>Sandeman's</HI> here&s;ies, and de&s;ire your thoughts upon them.</P>

<SPEAKER>CLERG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do as you. plea&s;e, &s;ir. As to <HI>San|domen,</HI> his books are written in a very artful manner, but are, in my opinion, the wor&s;t and mo&s;t pernicious of any that ever I read, which were pretended to &s;erve the cau&s;e of chri&s;tia|nity. What the author's de&s;ign was in writing them, I do not pretend to &s;ay; but the ten|dency of his &s;cheme of doctrine, repre&s;ented by him at the true go&s;pel &s;cheme, is to per|vert and turn the go&s;pel into ridicule, and in the i&s;&s;ue to &s;erve the intere&s;t of dei&s;m. It is to me very &s;urpri&s;ing that any of our clergy &s;hould go into his &s;entiments, &s;o far as &s;ome of them &s;eem to have done. I am &s;ure the&s;e things di&s;&s;erve the intere&s;t of chri&s;tian truth and virtue.</P>

<P>I will then fir&s;t mention &s;ome of the things I have collected out of two di&s;cour|&s;es of Dr. <HI>Whitaker,</HI> lately printed in <HI>London.</HI></P>

<P>I have not the happine&s;s of any particular acquaintance with the Dr. but have heard &s;ome things &s;poken of him to his honor, and wi&s;h the di&s;cour&s;es you refer to, were calculated to do him more honor than they do. I have read them, and confe&s;s my expectations were greatly di&s;appointed. I ob&s;erved &s;undry particulars which I greatly di&s;like, and think the general plan of the di&s;cour&s;e is wrong. But what are the things you have remarked as erroneuos?</P>

<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing by various le&s;&s;er matters, I will only mention &s;ome things which appear to me of importance. And fir&s;t, the Dr. &s;ays, p, 7. <Q>Man's enmity is the cau&s;e why God, became <HI>his enemy</HI>; and this enmity or anger of God is mo&s;t rea&s;onable and righteous.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLERG.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Dr. does not do well to re|pre&s;ent God's holy di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t man for his fir&s;t apo&s;tacy and rebellion, as the &s;ame with enmity. They are as different from each other as the di&s;plea&s;ure of a gracious, com|pa&s;&s;ionate father, towards an offending child, is from the hatred of an enemy. But if God did become his enemy, whence did he love him &s;o, as to give his own Son to &s;ave him? The Dr. &s;hall be his own corrector. He &s;ays, p. 27. <Q>The gift of Chri&s;t was the effect, not the cau&s;e of God's love.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe your tho'ts are right, &s;ir; but the Dr. &s;ays further, p. 10. <Q>It is good, ju&s;t and rea&s;onable for God to be an enemy to rebellious man: It <HI>was</HI> and <HI>is</HI> infinitely ju&s;t and <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> for God to <HI>treat</HI> him as an <HI>enemy.</HI></Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLERG.</SPEAKER>
<P>How came he then to be infinitely kind to him, and love him while in his enmi|ty and rebellion? Can directly oppo&s;ite affec|tions and methods of treatment towards the &s;ame per&s;on, under the &s;ame character and
<PB N="10" REF="011285_0009_0F869C580E277578">
circum&s;tances, be both infinitely rea&s;onable? If not, then, &s;uppo&s;ing the Dr.'s a&s;&s;ertion is true, God's good-will and kindne&s;s towards rebellious man is infinitely unrea&s;onable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your an&s;wers encourage me to pro|ceed. The Dr. quoting the&s;e words of the apo&s;tle, Rom. 3.25, 26. <HI>Whom God hath &s;et forth to be a propitiation, thro' faith in his blood, to declare his righteou&s;ne&s;s for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins that are pa&s;t&mdash;that he might be ju&s;t, and the ju&s;tifier of him that believes in Je&s;us,</HI> &s;ays, <Q>From this &s;cripture it plainly appears, that the great end for which Chri&s;t was made a &s;acrifice for &s;in, was to declare, manife&s;t, vindicate and honor the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God,</Q> (that is, as he explains him&s;elf, his puni&s;hing ju&s;tice) <Q>not to declare his kindne&s;s, and per&s;uade men that God is very merciful and ready to forgive them.</Q> And he &s;ays that <Q>men are of them&s;elves too ready to believe this without any arguments and per&s;uations,</Q> and thence infers, p. 26. <Q>Therefore Chri&s;t did not come into the world to declare or demon&s;trate that God is merciful, for it was not doubted before; but it was to manife&s;t the truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s of God di&s;co|vered in the law.</Q>&mdash;What &s;ay you to the&s;e things, &s;ir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLERG.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the fir&s;t place I &s;ay, the Dr. here
<PB N="11" REF="011285_0010_0F869C58C2D5E420">
inverts the order of the go&s;pel, and &s;preads a very di&s;honoring cloud over the glory of this di&s;pen&s;ation. The &s;cripture every where re|pre&s;ents the immediate and <HI>grand</HI> de&s;ign of Chri&s;t's appearing and &s;uffering in the fle&s;h, as being to manife&s;t God's mercy, and to mini&s;ter to and accompli&s;h the de&s;igns of his love to man. He became a &s;acrifice, to the honor of ju&s;tice, only as an expedient to open the way, for mercy or love to do all the good plea&s;ure of its will, in con&s;i&s;tence with ju&s;tice; as the apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>that God might be ju&s;t, and the ju&s;|tifier of the &s;inner who believes in Je&s;us.</HI> In this di&s;pen&s;ation ju&s;tice mini&s;ters to, and follows the lead of mercy. The Dr. acknowleges the truth in the&s;e words, <Q>The love of God broke out fir&s;t in the glorious act of giving Chri&s;t: to open a way for its honorable exerci&s;e in the &s;alvation of &s;inners.</Q> p. 27.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The good Dr. has undoubtedly mi&s;|taken the &s;en&s;e of the text you mention. By the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God there, he &s;uppo&s;es his puni&s;hing ju&s;tice to be intended; whereas the apo&s;tle intends his righteou&s;ne&s;s in pardon|ing &s;in and ju&s;tifying the &s;inner; that righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of God by which &s;inners are ju&s;tified, which the apo&s;tle oppo&s;es to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of obedience to the law. This, I think, is very manife&s;t from the apo&s;tle's rea&s;ning from
<PB N="12" REF="011285_0011_0F869C59800101D0">
the 20th to the 28th ver&s;e of this third chapter of Romans. The apo&s;tle u&s;es the word righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e as it is here u&s;ed in many other texts.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The Dr. is greatly mi&s;taken in &s;aying, God's mercy in freely pardoning and &s;aving poor guilty &s;inners, was not doubted before Chri&s;t revealed it, and that men are of them|&s;elves too prone to believe it. What he ob|&s;erves of carnal, &s;ecure &s;inners ea&s;ily believing the mercy of God, but not his ju&s;tice, is to no purpo&s;e&mdash;they only &s;eem to believe it: If they really believe any thing, it is that they have very little need of mercy. The true trial of their faith is taken from their being bro't under ju&s;t conviction of their &s;in and evil de&s;ert. And now they are found more ea&s;ily and ear|ne&s;tly to believe God's ju&s;tice than his mercy. What a guilty world wanted was a ju&s;t ground of faith concerning God's mercy and readine&s;s to forgive the penitent, and to be &s;hewn how this can be done con&s;i&s;tently with ju&s;tice, which the guilty do more readily believe; and this is done only by the go&s;pel.&mdash;But if it is as the Dr. &s;ays, whence is it that our fir&s;t parents before they had received any revelati|on of God's purpo&s;es of mercy to them, belie|ved his ju&s;tice but not his mercy, and were afraid when they heard the voice of their Lord,
<PB N="13" REF="011285_0012_0F869C5A437168A0">
and hid them&s;elve&s; among the trees? Fear or dread of divine wrath is the natural re&s;ult of a &s;en&s;e of guilt, and what all mankind feel the impre&s;&s;ion of, and can't be effectually relieved from but by the di&s;covery of God's mercy made by the go&s;pel. Accordingly the apo&s;tle &s;parks of the Gentiles as <HI>mourning without hope, and &s;ays Je&s;us Chri&s;t has redeemed tho&s;e who thro' fear of death were all their life time &s;ubject to bondage.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Dr. &s;ays, <Q>To a&s;&s;ert that the death of Chri&s;t hath cau&s;ed any rea&s;on for our reconciliation to God to exi&s;t which did not exi&s;t before, and which would not have exi&s;ted had not Chri&s;t died, is to a&s;&s;ert that it is now more rea&s;onable to love God than it would otherwi&s;e have been.

<P>The love of God in giving his Son to die for us, is con&s;tantly and ju&s;tly repre&s;ent|ed in &s;cripture as a new, peculiar and power|ful rea&s;on, why we &s;hould love and be recon|ciled to him, &s;ee 2 Cor. 5.20, 21. Now ac|cording to the Dr. i&s; Chri&s;t never had died, this rea&s;on would have exi&s;ted in the &s;ame &s;trength it does now; that is, if God had not &s;o loved the world as to give his Son to die for us, yet he would &s;till have &s;o loved us. I know the Dr. will not admit this; and for this rea&s;on he &s;hould not have laid down the premi&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>He al&s;o &s;ays, <Q>The &s;acrifice of Chri&s;t, and the love of God, does not make it more rea&s;onable for &s;inners to return,</Q> (that is, to God and their duty) <Q>than it was before, only that it is an additional obligati|on.</Q> p. 50,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLERG.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is, only as it makes it more abundantly rea&s;onable. I had rather be with|out the honor of making new di&s;coveries in the my&s;teries of divinity, than to take up with &s;uch poor ones as &s;erve to no other purpo&s;e than to &s;et people a &s;taring.</P>
</SP>

which po&s;&s;ibly you may like better. I will in the next place give you &s;ome of the things he &s;ays concerning the natural enmity of the hearts of the children of Adam again&s;t God.

So if the ca&s;e be with man as the Dr. &s;ays it is, the very frame of his nature mu&s;t be altered before he can be brought to love God: A view of his moral perfections, and go&s;pel truths can do nothing towards working this change, but this mu&s;t fir&s;t be wrought by ab&s;olute power, before the&s;e truths can take any hold of the heart. This change, according to the Dr. is wrought only by the exertion of a power of the holy Spirit upon the &s;oul of man, altoge|ther of a different kind from the power of di|vine truth and love, a power which produces its effects, not by moral exertions and means, but by a phy&s;ical, forcible exertion of &s;trength.

Preaching the go&s;pel is the ordinary means which God makes u&s;e of to reconcile &s;inners to him&s;elf, and it is as well calculated to work on the minds of &s;inners as any means can po&s;&s;ibly be: But yet all the motives the go&s;pel &s;ets before &s;inners will be ineffectual, without the agency of divine power to renew their hearts and conform them to his glori|ous character.</Q></P>

<PB N="29" REF="011285_0028_0F869C69AD0A1B08">
a greater &s;inner than he was when he lived in &s;ecurity, and the neglect of the means of grace. So that the impenitent, unregenerate &s;inner does not grow better, but rather wor&s;e by all the in&s;truction and knowlege he gets in the u&s;e of means. And awakened, convinced &s;inners, with whom mo&s;t means are u&s;ed, and who are mo&s;t at|tentive to the concerns of their &s;ouls, and mo&s;t in earne&s;t in the u&s;e of means, are commonly, if not always, really more guilty &amp; odious in God's &s;ight than they who are &s;ecure and at ea&s;e in their &s;ins.</Q>&mdash;p. 127. <Q>If the&s;e things be &s;o, then the &s;inners who continue impenitent under the greate&s;t convictions of con&s;ceience, and the mo&s;t concern about their &s;ouls and &s;alvation, and are con&s;equently taking the mo&s;t pains, and u&s;ing unwearied endeavors, are u&s;ually the greate&s;t &s;inners, really more guilty, more vicious and vile than they were when in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity; and lived in a great mea&s;ure in the neglect of the means of grace.

He has a change of mind and conduct with re&s;pect to &s;in and duty, with re&s;pect to God and the eternal world, which is effected by the knowlege and belief he has obtained of go&s;pel truths. Hopkins de&s;cribes him as for&s;aking and ab&s;taining from his old &s;ins, (&s;orry, no doubt, that he ever practi&s;ed them) as reforming his life and practi&s;ing the duties of religion, as far as he can, and as ear|ne&s;tly &s;eeking God's mercy and &s;alvation in the careful u&s;e of the appointed means of grace, and in a word, as going as far as he can under the influence of common grace, and the highe&s;t illuminations and influences of the Spirit of God, by the word, which are &s;hort of regene|rating and &s;aving. Is he now become a grea|ter &s;inner than, he was before? Is he now more guilty and vile, and odious to God than he would have been if his mind and conduct was contrary to what it is?

We u&s;ed to think and &s;ay, as our venerable fathers taught us, and the holy apo&s;tles before them, that men, and mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, can't convert &s;inners and draw them to God, becau&s;e they can only &s;peak the quickning, converting truths into their ears; but that the Spirit of Chri&s;t, by &s;peaking it into their hearts prevails, and divinely per&s;uades and draws them home to God in Chri&s;t. But according to our new divines, this internal teaching can do no more towards converting the &s;oul than the merely external. The holy Spirit acting as the Spirit of truth and endearing love, upon the minds and hearts of poor &s;inners can effect nothing. The more clearly and &s;trongly he repre&s;ents and impre&s;&s;es the glorious truth upon them, the more furiou&s;ly they rage in their enmity again&s;t the truth, and the foun|tain of truth.

<PB N="43" REF="011285_0042_0F869C796D58FA70">
But he can effect nothing by it; the harder he &s;trikes the head of this enmity with his &s;word, the &s;tronger and more lively it grows: (for the more natural men &s;ee of God's character and glory in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the more does their enmity ri&s;e and exert it&s;elf; if we may believe our new teachers.) In &s;hort, he is quite defeated, in the u&s;e of his own proper weapons, by every fooli&s;h &s;nner: And if he will conquer at la&s;t, he finds him&s;elf obliged to throw away his &s;word, and betake him&s;elf to a very different kind of power, which has nothing more of the moral kind in it, than the action of a watch-maker in taking out of a badly con&s;tructed watch a &s;uperfluous &s;pring which prevents the action of the true &s;pring.

To argue from one to the other is therefore idle and imperti|nent. The Spirit of God is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e two different kinds of power, and exerts the one or the other according as he wills to produce a change of the moral or phy&s;ical kind, in moral beings or others.&mdash;Exalt the power of the holy Spirit as much as you plea&s;e, in effecting the moral change in the &s;oul, called regene|ration; but then don't confound it with the power exerted upon dead bodies in quickning and glorifying them; but con&s;ider and repre&s;ent it according to its nature, as a moral power, which is he power of go&s;pel truth and love, applied by the Spirit of truth and love to the &s;oul, with his own peculiar energy.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLERG.</SPEAKER>
<P>It appears to me that the Dr's tho'ts on this &s;ubject are indige&s;ted, &s;uperficial, and not exactly ju&s;t. Perhaps you will think mine more &s;o: however, I will let you know them. Suffer me to make &s;everal ob&s;ervati|ons; as,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That the general pa&s;&s;ions of love and hatred are indeed "innate, and interwoven with the very frame of our hearts," and con|&s;titute part of their natural character&mdash;That <HI>good</HI> is the natural and right object of the pa&s;&s;i|on of love, and <HI>evil</HI> of hatred&mdash;Good may be di&s;tingui&s;hed into two general kinds, natu|ral and moral: &s;o may evil. A &s;pirit of equity and benignity is morally good: Unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s,
<PB N="52" REF="011285_0051_0F869C8216D788C0">
partiality, fraud, malignity, and cruelty are morally evil.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve al&s;o, There is in man a natural fa|culty whereby he is rendered capable of di&s;|cerning and di&s;tingui&s;hing between moral good and evil, as well as natural, and readily per|ceives the one to be right, amiable, and worthy of e&s;teem and honor, the other wrong, hateful and blame<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">rthy immediately, as &s;oon as the&s;e object are &s;een by the mind in their true light, or as being what they really are, with|out any further rea&s;oning about them. This faculty is "innate," an e&s;&s;ential part of the na|tural con&s;titution of all intelligent and moral beings, <HI>as &s;uch</HI>; and is found in experience, actually exi&s;ting both in righteous and wicked men. On this is founded the principle and power of natural con&s;cience. Bea&s;ts want this faculty of moral di&s;cernment, and therefore are naturally incapable of moral government; take, it out of our nature, or &s;uppo&s;e it de&s;troyed or inverted in man, and he is as unfit a &s;ubject of &s;uch a government as they.</P>
<P>From hence it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that act|ions and characters which are morally good, when viewed by the mind in their <HI>true light,</HI> or as being what they really are, can't but ap|pear good, amiable, and worthy of e&s;teem and honor, con&s;idered ab&s;olutely in them&s;elves
<PB N="53" REF="011285_0052_0F869C82C99CD4A8">
and they are in fact &s;o regarded by all men, in this view of them, and cannot be hated for their own &s;akes; and, on the contrary, actions and characters morally evil, viewed as above, appear to the mind evil, are di&s;approved as objects of moral hatred. To &s;uppo&s;e the con|trary is incon&s;i&s;tent with the exi&s;tence and exerci&s;e of the above-mentioned faculty of di&s;cerning and di&s;tingui&s;hing between moral good and evil; or otherwi&s;e, is to &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ame object, in the &s;ame view of it, to appear both good and evil, at the &s;ame time, and for the &s;ame rea&s;on; which is ab&s;urd and impo&s;|&s;ible. We do in fact &s;ee things in real life, as this rea&s;oning &s;hews them to be. Nothing is more common than to hear vicious men con|demn the vices in others, which they allow in them&s;elves, when circum&s;tances are &s;o varied that they don't &s;ee them&s;elves in them; and on the other hand, approve and commend tho&s;e virtues in others which they refu&s;e to practi&s;e: and what is more, in their calm and &s;erious intervals, they do, and can't but &s;ecretly di&s;|approve their own evil conduct and blame them&s;elves for it, (and would cea&s;e from it too if particular lu&s;ts did not draw them on) accor|ding to that ancient acknowlegement of the heathen philo&s;opher, "<HI>I &s;ee and approve tho&s;e things which are good, but practi&s;e tho&s;e that are

evil.</HI>" Which is a demon&s;tration that virtue is not hated as virtue, nor vice loved as vice. Vicious men do indeed too often call evil good, and good evil; but this is 'always effected by mi&s;repre&s;enting them to them&s;elves, and cloath|ing them with unnatural circum&s;tances, where|by they make them appear to their minds with a different face from the true.</P>

<P>Actions, and agents or characters morally good, may be con&s;idered in a twofold view; either fir&s;t, &s;imply, or ab&s;olutely as they are in them&s;elves: in which view of them, I have &s;aid, and I believe proved, that they can't be hated, can't but be approved as right and good by the mind of man, and by all moral beings: &mdash;Or &s;econdly, they may be con&s;idered relatively, or as they re&s;pect us. In this relative view of them, they may po&s;&s;ibly be hated, and
<PB N="55" REF="011285_0054_0F869C84945B8858">
in fact they too often are, becau&s;e they militate again&s;t &s;ome particular lu&s;t of our's, or are in|con&s;i&s;tent with &s;ome private intere&s;t we have much at heart. Thus a man who is guilty of trea&s;on, &s;eeing the equity of the judge's &s;en|tence again&s;t another per&s;on, as a cruel mur|derer, who he has no intere&s;t in, will very readily approve the judgment, becau&s;e he &s;ees the righteou&s;ne&s;s and equity of it: but let him be arraigned, and upon a fair trial, condemned for his trea&s;on, and his heart may very po&s;&s;ibly ri&s;e in enmity again&s;t his judge, again&s;t the law, and again&s;t the king; and perhaps he will pu&s;h his enmity &s;o far, if he can, as to dethrone his rightful &s;overeign. But what is his enmity levelled again&s;t? Is it again&s;t the condemning &s;entence &s;imply <HI>as righteous</HI>? Not at all: It is again&s;t it only as militating again&s;t his life. His love to his life is &s;tronger than his regard to righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;uppre&s;&s;es the acting of that. However, we often &s;ee the &s;en&s;e of righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;o &s;trong, even in un&s;anctified minds, under condemnation for their crimes, as to prevent the ri&s;ings of this unju&s;t enmity, and bring them to yield them|&s;elves to the hands of ju&s;tice. And all con|vinced &s;inners are bro't to a&s;cribe righteou&s;ne&s;s to the great God, and &s;ubmit at his foot, be|fore they receive his renewing and pardoning

mercy; (and this Dr. Whitaker owns, and even carries the matter too far) which they ne|ver could be bro't to till they are new made, if the enmity was again&s;t righteou&s;ne&s;s for it's own &s;ake, or as righteous, and innate, and a part of the pre&s;ent frame of the human heart, as he repre&s;ents the matter: and &s;o he &s;ome|times &s;ays.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>He &s;ays, p. 15 <Q>I firmly believe that no man ever was or will be reconciled to God, till he is brought to approve and willingly &s;ubmit to that righteou&s;ne&s;s of God which is reveal|ed from heaven again&s;t all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s and ungodline&s;s of men, and according to which he will render indignation and wrath, tribulation and angui&s;h upon every &s;oul or man that doeth evil: Which implies more in it than a bare owning that God is righteous, and will take vengeance on the wicked;&mdash; It implies an approbation of, and love to it, &s;o as to <HI>delight</HI> in God <HI>on this account,</HI> as well as for his infinite grace, love and mercy to tho&s;e that are &s;aved.</Q></P>
<P>The good gentleman is here got over into the contrary extreme so that which generally prevails in the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es.&mdash;He had &s;aid, p. 12.

<P>Ob&s;erve further, The character of the ble&s;|&s;ed God is the fir&s;t, the highe&s;t, the mo&s;t ex|cellent of all moral characters. All moral perfections are united in him, and in the high|e&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree; and the natural perfections as united with, and exerted for the purpo&s;e of di&s;playing and exerci&s;ing the moral, are, in this view of them, amiable as well as awful. God is therefore in him&s;elf ab&s;olutely and in|finitely
<PB N="57" REF="011285_0056_0F869C85CEC19680">
amiable. He can't then be the object of hatred to any moral being, con&s;idered &s;imply in him&s;elf; or in other words, his character can't be hated for its own &s;ake, or as appear|ing to the mind wrong and worthy of di&s;appro|bation in its own nature. If any do hate it, as wicked men in &s;ome &s;en&s;e do, it is only as relatively con&s;idered, and from intere&s;ted views.</P>

<SPEAKER>CLERG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doubtle&s;s there is &s;uch a prevail|ing contrariety to God and his laws in the hearts of men, &s;o far as lu&s;ts of &s;in rule in them. But then, in this they are contrary to <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> as well as to God. If they have light in their under&s;tanding, they di&s;approve what they al|low in practi&s;e, and approve the law as ju&s;t and good, at the &s;ame time that, for their lu&s;ts &s;ake, they bear partial enmity to it, as contra|ry
<PB N="58" REF="011285_0057_0F869C86C1E76958">
to them. And if they thus hate the law, they at the &s;ame time blame and condemn them&s;elves as acting <HI>wrong</HI> in acting contrary to it; which is a ju&s;tificasion of God and his law, and a demon&s;tration that this enmity to God is an <HI>intere&s;ted</HI> and <HI>unnatural</HI> pa&s;&s;ion, and does violence to the moral &s;en&s;e planted in the mind by the hand of the Creator: and herein lies the great malignity of wilful &s;in.</P>
<P>From what has been ob&s;erved on this &s;ub|ject, it follows, that it is not enough to engage a &s;inner to love God with a &s;upreme practical regard, to &s;hew him the character of God, as amiable in it&s;elf; he mu&s;t al&s;o be &s;hewn how it is con&s;i&s;tent with his happine&s;s, and has a benign a&s;pect upon him, and how his life and happine&s;s are connected with his duty to God. 'Tis the great de&s;ign of the go&s;pel to do both the&s;e. And when the holy Spirit gives this double view to the mind of a poor &s;inner, by the word of the go&s;pel, and &s;rongly impre&s;&s;es this &s;en&s;e upon the heart, there needs no more; his enmity dies, &s;lain by the moral power of this glorious light of the truth and love of God; his heart is reconciled, and flows out in ad|miring love and prai&s;e, and di&s;&s;olves in genu|ine repentance: he is a new creature, in the moral &s;en&s;e.

<P>I &s;uppo&s;e he goes into this forced and unju&s;t interpretation, of the text, from hard nece&s;&s;ity: for in the obvious &s;en&s;e of the apo&s;|tle's words, they oppo&s;e and overthrow his new &s;cheme of doctrine. But I think it is much &s;a&s;er, much better, and more honorable for men to remove their own wrong notions put of the way of the holy apo&s;tle's, than to compel them to give the way to their up&s;tart errors. But I return to the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Another con&s;equence is, that the enmity of man's heart against God is not, properly &s;peak|ing, one of the "innate," or natural pa&s;&s;ions, "interwoven with the frame of our hearts," as Dr. Whitaker &s;ays it is; or in other words, it is not one of the <HI>primary</HI> pa&s;&s;ions of human nature in the pre&s;ent &s;late of it, but is a <HI>&s;econdary</HI> pa&s;&s;ion only, a con&s;equence and re&s;ult of par|ticular
<PB N="60" REF="011285_0059_0F869C8B8E57AD38">
wrong affections, indulged in oppo&s;ition to the law and will of God. Any particular &s;inful affection, whether of the &s;en&s;ual, covet|ous, or ambitious kind, (of which we have the &s;eeds of more than enough in us ever &s;ince the fall) thus indulged, is practical oppo&s;ition, or enmity, if you plea&s;e, to the law of God. And the&s;e per&s;i&s;ted in again&s;t light, will draw after them a higher and more malignant kind of enmity againt God, as &s;tanding in the way of &s;uch indulged lu&s;ts. And in this ca&s;e, if the &s;en&s;e of God's righteou&s;ne&s;s in oppo&s;ing and condemning the &s;inner in his evil way is weak, (as it too commonly is) and the &s;en&s;e of his own faultine&s;s low and cull, this enmity may flame out dreadfully, and work up to bla&s;phe|my and cur&s;ing: This is the pre&s;ent &s;tate of devils, and in a &s;ad degree the ca&s;e of &s;ome men. But it is a great mi&s;take to &s;uppo&s;e and teach that things will remain in this horrid confu&s;ion in wicked minds forever, as too many do.&mdash;When God comes near to judgment he will reveal his righteou&s;ne&s;s from heaven, and im|pre&s;s upon all wicked &s;ouls both of men and devils, &s;uch a clear, convincing, &s;trong &s;en&s;e of the equity and fairne&s;s, and <HI>real kindne&s;s</HI> of his di&s;pen&s;ations towards them in their former &s;tate of trial, of the heinou&s;ne&s;s of their offen|ces, and of the ju&s;tice and moral nece&s;&s;ity of

his pre&s;ent &s;entence of condemnation, (which impre&s;&s;ion will never be &s;uffered to wear off any more) as will &s;o far over ballance their na|tural &s;elf-love, as to oblige them to ju&s;tify God's character, conduct, and judgment, in word and mind ; and forever &s;ilence all murmurings, injurious reflections, and hard &s;peeches again&s;t him, and all bla&s;phemy and cur&s;ings of their Maker: Their rage will then turn inward again&s;t them&s;elves, as the flame of a reverbera|ting furnace falls with all its force upon the melting metal. This is the view which he who knew gives us of the final condition of lo&s;t &s;ouls: <HI>There &s;hall be weeping, and wailing, and gra&s;hing of teeth,</HI> he tells us; but not a word of bla&s;phemous rage again&s;t God. No: Hell will at la&s;t, in this re&s;pect, be as &s;ilent as the grave.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved above, that the enmity of &s;inful &s;ouls again&s;t God's true character is directed again&s;t it only as relatively con&s;idered, and is a &s;econdary pa&s;&s;ion, which ari&s;es in the heart in con&s;equence of men's indulgence of particular lu&s;ts, which fir&s;t lead them into a practical op|po&s;ition to the law and righteous will of God. When the light of truth manife&s;ts their deeds to be evil and reproves them, and kindly calls them back into the right way, if they &s;ubmit to the reproof, and obey the merciful call, their

oppo&s;ition to God cea&s;es, no higher enmity can ri&s;e in their hearts ; their enmity is turned again&s;t their <HI>own</HI> lu&s;ts; But if they refu&s;e to receive reproof, and per&s;i&s;t in their &s;ins again&s;t light, the light becomes offen&s;ive, and they hate it, as reproving them; <HI>The &s;corner hateth him that reproveth him.</HI> But &s;till, even in &s;pite of them&s;elves, they do, and can't but &s;ecretly approve God's character as right and good, whenever they are brought to view it in it's true light; &s;uch is the natural and unchangable frame or con&s;titution of their &s;ouls, as intelli|gent and moral beings. God has placed in every man's brea&s;t, and will forever maintain there, a true witne&s;s for him&s;elf, and again&s;t their own wickedne&s;s ; which will &s;peak, and can't but he regarded as "reproving with equi|ty," whenever the light pf God breaks in upon the mind.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A certain gentleman hearing this dialogue read, objected to the that I mi&s;repre&s;ented the &s;entiments of tho&s;e gentlemen who think with Dr. Whitaker; that he never knew any among them who do not acknowlege a moral con&s;titution of nature, the natu|ral powers of rea&s;on and con&s;cience. Perhaps &s;ome others in reading, may make the &s;ame reflection. For their &s;akes, I here give the an&s;wer I gave him. "It is true they do acknowlege &s;uch faculties in human nature; I have not &s;aid they do not: But they are incon&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves, and give &s;uch a de&s;|cription of the natural enmity of &s;he heart to God's whole cha|racter and all moral excellence, as, if true, nece&s;&s;arily implies the de&s;truction of natural con&s;cience" Natural con&s;cience ne|ce&s;&s;arily implies a faculty by which we di&s;cern the difference be|tween moral good or excellence, and its contrary, and that the mind &s;eeing this difference approves the good, as excellent, and worthy of e&s;teem and honor, and di&s;approves the evil as wrong, hateful, and blame-worthy. This is ab&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tency with &s;uch a kind of enmity, and total want of <Q>taste for moral excel|lency, and ulter abhorrence of God's whole character, inter|woven with the very frame of the heart,</Q> as D. Whitaker and "others dream of.&mdash;Gentlemen ought to attend better to their own ideas, and compare them &s;o as to &s;ee their incon&s;i&s;tance, that they may clear their di&s;confess of contradictions, and not advance principles &s;ubver&s;ive of each other.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="011285_0062_0F869C8D4DF25FA0">The Phari&s;ees, in, our Saviour's time, car|ried their enmity again&s;t God and all that is morally good, as far as mo&s;t men have done; and yet they are practical witne&s;&s;es to the truth of what I have laid. Our Lord repre&s;ented their own wicked character to them, in his parable of the vineyard let out to hu&s;bandmen, in &s;uch a manner as to give them a clear and ju&s;t view of it, and at the &s;ame time to conceal from them their concern in it; and then a&s;ked them, &s;aying, <HI>When therefore the lord of the vineyard cometh, what will he do to tho&s;e hu&s;bandmen?

One &s;uch witne&s;s is of more weight than ten thou&s;and confident a&s;&s;ertions of &s;peculative men, in contradiction thereto.</P>
<P>This doctrine concerning the enmity of carnal men again&s;t God, is further confirmed by this ob&s;ervation, which holds univer&s;ally true in fact, viz. Men who hate God, his ways, and righteous &s;ervants, always mi&s;repre|&s;ent their characters to them&s;elves, paint them in fal&s;e and odious colours, and place them in &s;uch a wrong view as to make them appear either contemptible, or morally evil: This is the method they always take to ju&s;tify to <HI>them|&s;eves,</HI> well as toothers, their enmity to them; which they would not do if moral rectitude, wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s and goodne&s;s, were, in them&s;elves, objects of their natural hatred; but their hatred would point it&s;elf directly again&s;t them, as being what they really are; as in the ca&s;e of natural aver&s;ions to &s;ome particular kinds of food. This hatred of wicked men

again&s;t God is then an <HI>intere&s;ted</HI> and <HI>partial</HI> affection, taken up in aid and &s;upport of &s;ome carnal lu&s;ts and intere&s;ts they are devoted to.</P>
<P>Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who knows all the &s;ecret &s;prings of human pa&s;&s;ions and actions, points out to us the true root and &s;pring of this wicked enmity, in &s;uch a clear manner as, I think, ought to be deci&s;ive, when he &s;ays, &s;peaking of the wicked who &s;hall be condemned, <HI>Men loved darkne&s;s rather than light,</HI> (whence this ab&s;urd and mon&s;trous preference of darkne&s;s to light?) <HI>becau&s;e their deeds are evil.</HI> Particular wrong affections and &s;infill pa&s;&s;ions, fir&s;t draw men away to do evil, (the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, in human na|ture, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, will act wrong and be &s;prings of evil works, till the truth and grace of God rectify their di&s;orders, and take them under their lead) and then for their lu&s;ts &s;ake, and with a view to ju&s;tify and quiet them&s;elves in their evil ways, they <HI>love darkne&s;s rather than light. For every one that doeth evil</HI> (with habitual wilfulne&s;s) <HI>hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, le&s;t his deeds &s;hould be repro|ved,</HI> or di&s;covered to him&s;elf to be what they really are, in their nature and tendency. For then he mu&s;t be &s;trongly &s;elf-condemned, and filled with fear; which wicked men will avoid as long as they can They therefore hate the light, ju&s;t as every judge, who has taken a bribe,
<PB N="66" REF="011285_0065_0F869C9067627560">
hateth the light of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and him that di&s;covers and reproves him for his bribery and corruption. Ahab expre&s;&s;ed the very &s;oul of this wicked, intere&s;ted enmity when he &s;aid to the King of Judah, &s;peaking of Michajah, <HI>I hate him, for he doth not prophe&s;y good con|cerning me, but evil.</HI> Had we Michajah's cha|racter, as drawn by Ahab, doubtle&s;s it would be a very bad one. The wilful mi&s;repre&s;enta|tions which wicked men make to them&s;elves of God's character and works, their evil &s;peak|ings and bla&s;phemies of him, are a full evidence that their enmity again&s;t him is initere&s;ted, not &s;uch as Dr. Whitaker and &s;ome others repre|&s;ent it. No man ever did &s;peak evil of God's ways, viewing them as they truly are, as equi|table and good, but as placing them in a wrong light to them&s;elves. When they are obliged to &s;ee them as they are, they are reduced to &s;i|lence, can object nothing to them, but ju&s;tify and approve them as right, and condemn them|&s;elves. The&s;e are not idle and arbitrary &s;pecu|lations, but ob&s;ervations grounded upon facts and experience of the workings of the human heart in real life.</P>
<P>Our Lord directs his di&s;ciples &s;aying, <HI>Let your light &s;hine before men, that they &s;eeing your good works, may glorify your Father who is in heaven.</HI> Now, according to the notion under
<PB N="67" REF="011285_0066_0F869C9103680A30">
cen&s;ure, the more clearly the light &s;hines and is &s;een by men, the more furiou&s;ly does their enmity flame and rage again&s;t God and tho&s;e that bear his image. This is a way of glorify|ing God which Je&s;us Chri&s;t never advi&s;ed his di&s;ciples to &s;tir men up to.</P>

<P>The evidence is full, the oppo&s;ite &s;cale kicks the beam. All rea&s;onable and ho|ne&s;t men, I think, can beat at no lo&s;s to determine on which &s;ide the truth lies. The notion which Dr. Whitaker and many others teach, viz. That enmity to the true character of God, for its own &s;ake, is an innate principle, and inter|woven with the very frame of the human heart, is manife&s;tly fal&s;e, and I wi&s;h it may &s;oon peri&s;h, for it is the grand foundation of the Sandema|nian &s;cheme of doctrine, which is one of the wor&s;t &s;chemes that was ever invented.</P>

<P>Since we are upon the melancholy &s;ubject of the enmity of poor &s;inners again&s;t God, I will ju&s;t mention one thing more.</P>
<P>Many very hone&s;t and good people bave of|ten complained of the workings of a &s;ecret en|mity and hard thoughts of God, and quarrel|lings again&s;t him; which does not, like that we have been di&s;cour&s;ing upon, ari&s;e out of the wickedne&s;s of the heart, but is wholly occa&s;i|oned by mi&s;repre&s;entations of the character and ways of God to the mind, and fal&s;e and wrong views of him, which have unhappily gotten po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mind, and are &s;uppo&s;ed, thro' ignorance and wrong in&s;truction, to be the true and genuine views of his character and works. In the light wherein they view them, they appear morally evil, wrong, and objects of ju&s;t hatred. The enmity which the mind conceives again&s;t them, viewed in this wrong light, is, in a proper &s;en&s;e, a natural enmity; that is, it ari&s;es from the moral frame of the mind, and the innate &s;en&s;e of the hatefulne&s;s
<PB N="69" REF="011285_0068_0F869C93C460DD68">
of actions and characters morally, evil and wrong. And if the heart is gracious, this &s;en&s;e is greatly heightened. This kind of enmity is, in no true con&s;truction, a hatred of God's true character, which may be heartily approved and loved at the &s;ame time; but only of a really bad character, fal&s;ely a&s;cribed to him, merely thro' ignorance, mi&s;take and mi&s;information. This may be illu&s;trated by the ca&s;e of a child educated abroad, who has in&s;tilled into his mind, perhaps by the fooli&s;h tattle of his nur&s;e or &s;choolma&s;ter, very wrong and injurious no|tions of his father's character, and temper, and de&s;igns towards him; repre&s;enting of him as very unrea&s;onable, arbitrary and cruel, or fal&s;e and hypocritical towards him; whereas, in truth, he is quite the rev&s;r&s;e. This wrong view rai&s;es in the child di&s;iffection, and hard and blaming tho'ts. His father, who knows the ca&s;e, pities him, con&s;idering it as ignorance and error, not malice again&s;t his true fa|ther.&mdash;The true and effectual cure of this kind of enmity, is accompli&s;hed by correcting the&s;e unhappy mi&s;apprehen&s;ions, and giving the mind a ju&s;t view of the true character of God, and &s;etting his actions and di&s;pen&s;ations in that true light wherein he him&s;elf has placed them.</P>
