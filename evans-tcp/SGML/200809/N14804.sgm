<HEAD>ELIZABETH RUTGERS AGAINST JOSHUA WADINGTON.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was an action of tre&s;pa&s;s brought again&s;t the Defendant upon an act of the Legi&s;lature of this &s;tate, pa&s;&s;ed the &s;even|teenth of March, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and eighty-three, for the occupation of a brew-hou&s;e and malt-hou&s;e of the Plaintiff, from the thirteenth day of Augu&s;t, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;e|venty-eight, until the time of pa&s;&s;ing the act above|mentioned. The cau&s;e came on to be argued upon demurrer, before the Honorable James Duane, E&s;q. Mayor, Richard Varrick, E&s;q. Recorder, Benja|min Blagge, William W. Gilbert, William Neil|&s;on, Thomas Randal, and Thomas Ivers, E&s;quires, Aldermen, on Tue&s;day the twenty-ninth day of June pa&s;t.</P>
<P>The Coun&s;el for the Plaintiff, were Mr. Law|rence, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Attorney-General, Mr. Wil|cox, and Mr. Troupe. Tho&s;e for the Defendant,
<PB N="4" REF="018773_0004_0FA819175733E548">
were Mr. Hamilton, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Mr. B. Living&s;ton, and Mr. Lewis.</P>
<P>Mr. Lawrence opened the pleadings and argu|ments on the part of the Plaintiff, and was followed by Mr. Wilcox. Mr. Living&s;ton, Mr. Lewis, and Mr. Hamilton, were next &s;ucce&s;&s;ively heard, in be|half of the Defendant; and were replied to by Mr. Lawrence, Mr. Troupe, and the Attorney-General. The arguments on both &s;ides were elaborate, and the authorities numerous.</P>
<P>The Court took time to advi&s;e, until Tue&s;day the twenty-&s;eventh day of Augu&s;t, and then the Hono|rable the Mayor proceeded to deliver the judgment of the Court, as follows:</P>
<P>"IN the ca&s;e of Elizabeth Rutgers, ver&s;us Jo&s;hua Waddington, which we gave notice &s;hould be de|termined this day, the Court now proceed to judg|ment. It is repre&s;ented to be a controver&s;y of <HI>high importance;</HI> from the <HI>value</HI> of the property, which in this and other actions depends on the &s;ame <HI>princi|ples;</HI> from involving in it que&s;tions, which mu&s;t af|fect the <HI>national character:</HI>&mdash;Que&s;tions who&s;e deci&s;ion will record the &s;pirit of our Courts to pro&s;perity! Que&s;tions which embrace the whole law of nations!</P>
<P>It were to be wi&s;hed, that a cau&s;e of this magni|tude was not to receive its fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion from a Court of &s;uch a limited juri&s;diction, as that in which we pre&s;ide;&mdash;from <HI>Magi&s;trates actively</HI> engaged in e&s;tabli&s;hing the police of a di&s;ordered city, and in other duties, which cut them off from tho&s;e &s;tudious re&s;earches, which great and intricate que&s;tions re|quire. If we err in our opinion, it will be a a con&s;olation, that it has been intimated, "to be

<P>And as to the further plea of the &s;aid Jo&s;hua, to the whole of the tre&s;pa&s;s afore&s;aid by him pleaded in bar, the Plaintiff demurs.</P>

<P>The pleadings clo&s;e with joinders in demurrer, in the u&s;ual forms.</P>
<P>From the&s;e pleadings, and the arguments which they have produced, three que&s;tions are pre&s;ented for our con&s;ideration.&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">I&s;t. Whether the Plaintiff's ca&s;e is within the letter and intent of the &s;tatute on which this action is grounded?</P>
<P N="2">IIdly. Whether the laws of nations give the cap|tors, and Defendant under them, rights which con|troul the operation of the &s;tatute and bar the pre&s;ent &s;uit?</P>
<P N="3">IIIdly. Whether there is &s;uch an amne&s;ty in|cluded or implied in the definitive treaty of peace, as virtually or effectually relinqui&s;hes or relea&s;es the Plaintiff's demand under the &s;aid &s;tatute?</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="018773_0013_0FA819205AE813A8">Under one or other of the&s;e heads, all the rea&s;ons and authorities which have been offered on both &s;ides, may be properly applied:</P>
<P N="1">I. Then we are to enquire, whether the Plain|tiff's ca&s;e is within the letter and intent of the &s;ta|tute, on which this action is grounded.</P>
<P>From the conce&s;&s;ions which ari&s;e out of the plead|ings, we find, that according to the letter of the &s;ta|tute, &s;he was an inhabitant of this city, who by rea&s;on of the inva&s;ion of the enemy, left her place of abode; and that &s;he hath not &s;ince voluntarily put her&s;elf into the power of the enemy; that the brew-hou&s;e and malt-hou&s;e in que&s;tion, were part of her real e&s;tate;
<Q>that they were occupied by the Defendant as charged in the declaration, and at the time of &s;uch occupancy, were in the power of the enemy:</Q>
and nothing more is required to make Mrs. Rutgers a compleat Plaintiff, within the &s;tatute.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of conte&s;ting this point, the Defendant's coun&s;el endeavour to &s;hew, that according to the in|tention of the Legi&s;lature, the &s;tatute cannot com|prehend the Defendant. For this purpo&s;e, they &s;trongly rely on his being a Briti&s;h &s;ubject, re&s;iding in this city as a merchant, under the protection of the Briti&s;h army, when the cau&s;e of action accrued.</P>
<P>Without embarra&s;&s;ing the que&s;tion <HI>at pre&s;ent</HI> with the privileges claimed for the Defendant, either from the temporary <HI>conque&s;t</HI> of the city, or the <HI>defi|nitive treaty,</HI>&mdash;which will hereafter meet with due attention &mdash;it &s;eems proper to con&s;ider &s;imply, whe|ther from the nature of the provi&s;ion, and the cir|cum&s;tances of the Defendant, he was <HI>intended</HI> to be included in the &s;tatute, for if it doth not extend to

him there is an end of the &s;uit&mdash;if it doth extend, there will be a fair opening to examine&mdash;whether the temporary conque&s;t, or the treaty of peace, operate as an extingui&s;hment, or relea&s;e of the cau&s;e of acti|on?

<P>The &s;tatute was made at the eye of a war, when peace, and an evacuation of the &s;outhern di&s;trict, were like to take place. The object of it, as the title expre&s;&s;es, was for granting a more effectual re|lief in ca&s;es of certain tre&s;pa&s;&s;es. The per&s;ons who are to be redre&s;&s;ed are the exiles, who were compel|led to retire from their e&s;tates, on the inva&s;ion of the &s;outhern di&s;trict: The per&s;ons to be pro&s;ecuted, were tho&s;e who had occupied, injured, or de&s;troy|ed, the real or per&s;onal e&s;tates of tho&s;e exiles, with|in the power of the enemy: and it is provided, that every Defendant who had occupied, injured or de|&s;troyed the property, &s;hall be held to bail; and that no Defendant &s;hall be admitted to plead in ju&s;|tification, any military order, or command of the enemy for &s;uch occupation, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This then is clearly a <HI>remedial law.</HI> Great pains have been taken on both &s;ides, to enforce the <HI>rules</HI> by which it ought to be expounded.</P>
<P>The coun&s;el for the Defendant urge, that a &s;ound legal di&s;cretion ought to be u&s;ed in recurring to fir&s;t principles; &s;o as to make law a rule of right, and not a net to entangle ju&s;tice. That <HI>Ratio e&s;t anima legis: et qui haeret in litera haeret in cortice;</HI> they point

<Q>In order, &s;ays he, to form a right judgment whether a ca&s;e be within the equity of a &s;tatute, it is a good way to &s;uppo&s;e the law maker pre&s;ent, and that you a&s;ked him the que&s;tion&mdash;did you intend to comprehend this ca&s;e? Then you mu&s;t give your|&s;elf &s;uch an&s;wer as you imagine, he <HI>being an upright and rea&s;onable man,</HI> would have given. If this be, that he did mean to comprehend it, you may &s;afe|ly hold the ca&s;e to be within the equity of the &s;ta|tute; for while you do no more than he would have done, you do not act contrary to but in con|formity with the &s;tatute.</Q></P>
<P>The re&s;ult of all the&s;e rules is obviou&s;ly this&mdash; that <HI>remedial laws</HI> are &s;o to be expounded as to have their <HI>full force</HI>&mdash;in <HI>advancement</HI> of the <HI>remedy</HI>&mdash;upon an equitable interpretation&mdash;according to the <HI>inten|tion</HI> of the Legi&s;lature&mdash;to be &s;ought after by a <HI>&s;ound, legal di&s;cretion</HI></P>
<P>Under the impre&s;&s;ion of the&s;e maxims, it is a&s;ked whether the law <HI>intended</HI> to <HI>exempt,</HI> or to <HI>include</HI> a per|&s;on under the circum&s;tances or de&s;cription of the Defendant.</P>
<P>Here then is a Briti&s;h merchant, who merely for the purpo&s;e of commerce re&s;ided in the city, while it was in the power of the Briti&s;h, for his own private accomodation: He was permitted by the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary-General,</HI> and afterwards by the Commander in Chief, to enjoy the Plaintiff's property for near &s;ix years: He has paid as a rent, one hundred and fifty pounds a year, for three years only of the term, to the order of the Briti&s;h Commander in Chief. He remains in the city, pur&s;uing his bu&s;ine&s;s as a merchant, altho'

tho&s;e under who&s;e protection he exerci&s;ed his func|tion, are long &s;ince withdrawn.</P>
<P>The temporary conque&s;t and the definitive treaty out of the que&s;tion, what can exempt him from the de&s;cription of the &s;tatute? Can any or all the max|ims laid down by his coun&s;el for its con&s;truction? Before a&s;&s;ent is yielded to &s;uch a propo&s;ition, let us take a nearer view of his ca&s;e as connected with his principals under whom he ju&s;tifies.</P>
<P>If they did not come to this country to join the military in its oppre&s;&s;ion, and to enrich them&s;elves by its &s;poils&mdash;a &s;u&s;picion too di&s;honorable to be en|tertained! If they re&s;ided here under the protection of the Briti&s;h army, to pur&s;ue their <HI>private</HI> affairs as merchants&mdash;as their pleas avow, and we are bound to believe.&mdash;If for their <HI>private</HI> purpo&s;es, without rela|tion to or connection with the war, they occupied the Plaintiff's tenements, confe&s;&s;edly for a con&s;ider|able part of the time without any con&s;ideration at all? why it is repeated &s;hould they be exempted from this &s;tatute?</P>
<P>How, as applied to them per&s;onally and indepen|dent of national con&s;iderations, can it be harder con|trary to rea&s;on or ju&s;tice, that they &s;hould be com|pelled to pay an adequate rent for the accommoda|tions which they have enjoyed? why &s;hould they even wi&s;h to be exempted at the expence of a widow, driven into exile by the dread of a <HI>&s;iege,</HI> or the ex|pectation of a <HI>&s;torm?</HI> would not this be unrea&s;ona|ble, unju&s;t? If, according to the advice of Plow|den, we were to &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves conver&s;ing with the members of the Legi&s;lature; that the Defen|dant's ca&s;e was fairly &s;tated, as it in fact exi&s;ted, at the moment of pa&s;&s;ing the &s;tatute; and that they
<PB N="18" REF="018773_0018_0FA819242C23A6F0">
had been a&s;ked whether they meant to comprehend &s;uch a ca&s;e, what would probably be their an&s;wer? there is no doubt in our minds but it would be in the <HI>affirmative.</HI> The &s;pirit import general terms of the &s;tatute; its de&s;ign and the circum&s;tances which gave it birth, &s;eem fully to ju&s;tify this conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides that Legi&s;lature knew too well the prac|tice of war, to &s;uppo&s;e that the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary-General</HI> of a Briti&s;h army had competent authority to grant the licen&s;e or permi&s;&s;ion in que&s;tion: From the nature of his office the contrary would be pre&s;umed, e&s;pecially when the pleas them&s;elves aver expre&s;sly,
<Q>that the &s;aid brew-hou&s;e and malt-hou&s;e, by <HI>virtue of authority from the Commander in Chief</HI> of the &s;aid army, were taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of by the &s;aid Com|mi&s;&s;ary-General for <HI>the u&s;e of the &s;aid army.</HI></Q>
The licen&s;e then from the Commi&s;&s;ary to occupy tho&s;e tenements for the private purpo&s;es of the Defendant's employers was repugnant to the orders of his Com|mander in Chief; an encroachment on other depart|ments, for which there was no colour of right; and it is con&s;equently to be con&s;idered as a mere nullity. This had the facts been fully repre&s;ented, the Legi&s;lature could not but have ob&s;erved: To give it now its pro|per weight will be the duty of the court.</P>
<P>As a circum&s;tance of much moment to the Defend|ant it is contended, that the <HI>obtaining and the occupancy</HI> of the tenements in que&s;tion, related to the war.</P>
<P>In arguments, which di&s;play great &s;kill, and an uncommon degree of zeal and indu&s;try, this intere&s;t|ing point is &s;lightly touched.</P>
<P>The <HI>relation&s;hip to the war</HI> re&s;ults from the capture of the city, &s;ay the gentlemen, by which the right to the u&s;e of the lands ve&s;ted in the <HI>conqueror:</HI> His
<PB N="19" REF="018773_0019_0FA81924DD2F4870">
authority to the Defendant to u&s;e it continues the relation, and by way of illu&s;tration this ca&s;e is &s;tated &mdash;
<Q>a prize &s;hip is condemned and &s;old&mdash;the pur|cha&s;er is a merchant: tho' this is a <HI>private &s;pecula|tion</HI> on his part, yet the damage done was in rela|tion to the war, and the &s;ale and purcha&s;e good.</Q></P>
<P>But this is a remote argument indeed. The mer|chant here had no other agency than to purcha&s;e a prize lawfully condemned, in which, by the law of nations, the original owner no longer had any inter|e&s;t, the property being ab&s;olutely and effectually changed. Can it then be &s;aid with the lea&s;t appear|ance of rea&s;on, that this purcha&s;e was an act which bore a relation to the war? it is true the original capture and the damage &s;u&s;tained by it were con&s;equences of the war; but the&s;e circum&s;tances could produce no rela|tion&s;hip between the act done by the merchant&mdash; The purcha&s;e, which is the true point&mdash;and the war.</P>
<P>Let <HI>us</HI> &s;uppo&s;e a ca&s;e; a &s;tatute pa&s;&s;es to criminate every man within the power of the enemy, who had voluntarily done any act on the &s;ide of the enemy, in relation to the war; could this Defendant on the facts &s;tated in the pleadings, have been convicted? Take up that part of the ca&s;e, which would have been mo&s;t unfavourable to him&mdash;his contract with the Briti&s;h commander: He hired the tenements from him; but it was for the purpo&s;e of his own <HI>private commerce:</HI> The rent which he paid contributed to &s;trengthen the hands of the enemy; but they had a right to rai&s;e contributions; they had a force to collect them, which could not be re&s;i&s;ted. Here then is no evi|dence of ho&s;tility or enmity, of a concern in or rela|tion to the war. The mo&s;t zealous of our friends, within their power, could have been compelled to be related to the war in this way: They mu&s;t either
<PB N="20" REF="018773_0020_0FA819259CA6EE30">
&s;ubmit to be accommodated on the terms of the con|queror, or to peri&s;h in the &s;treets. Under the pro|&s;ecution then which we have &s;uppo&s;ed, the Defendant mu&s;t have been acquitted.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not be amu&s;ed by high &s;ounding words &mdash;too much is attempted&mdash;if a con&s;truction of the licen&s;e from the Briti&s;h commander to occupy the tenements for the three la&s;t years of the term, had depended <HI>ab&s;tractedly</HI> on the voice of rea&s;on, we mu&s;t have found it difficult to conceive how even &s;uch a licen&s;e bore a <HI>relation to the war.</HI></P>
<P>Here however, other con&s;iderations, which it will be premature to explain in this place, mu&s;t have their weight.</P>
<P>But when it is in&s;i&s;ted that the remainder of the term for which the tenements were held under the bare unauthoritative permi&s;&s;ion of the Commi&s;&s;ary-General, had <HI>any relation to the war,</HI> it is altogether without foundation.</P>
<P>We proceed now to the &s;econd general head, in which it is propo&s;ed:</P>
<P N="2">IIdly. To enquire&mdash;whether the law of nations gives the captors, and the Defendant under them, <HI>rigths</HI> which <HI>controul</HI> the operation of the &s;tatute, and <HI>bar</HI> the pre&s;ent &s;uit?</P>
<P>To maintain tho&s;e rights and that controul, the Defendant's coun&s;el have entered into a large di&s;play of the law of nations, its principles, divi&s;ions, obli|gations and effects, and have pointed out the &s;acred|ne&s;s of its authority, and the temerity and di&s;honour, in a national view, of countenancing any act repug|nant to it.</P>
<P>On the other hand, one of the Plaintiff's coun&s;el from a view of the contradictory opinions, which
<PB N="21" REF="018773_0021_0FA81926D70BDF30">
were read, &s;eemed to think that this law afforded no rule of right, and ought to have no influence on the government of a people.</P>
<P>The truth is, that the law of nations is a noble and mo&s;t important in&s;titution: The rights of &s;ove|reigns, and the happine&s;s of the human race, are promoted by its maxims and concerned for its vin|dication.</P>
<P>We hitherto have not been &s;o loudly called upon to form and inculcate an exten&s;ive knowledge of this intere&s;ting &s;cience; but now &s;ince we are placed in a new &s;ituation, as one of the nations of the earth, it is become an indi&s;pen&s;able obligation. We pro|fe&s;s to revere the rights of human nature; at every hazard and expence we have vindicated, and &s;uc|ce&s;sfully e&s;tabli&s;hed them in our land! and we can|not but reverence a law which is their chief guar|dian&mdash;a law which inculcates as a fir&s;t principle&mdash; that the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Principles of the Law of Nature, referred to.&mdash;That man was made for <HI>&s;ociety</HI>&mdash;that &s;ociety is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for <HI>man</HI>&mdash;that the <HI>public good</HI> ought always to be the &s;upreme rule&mdash;that the &s;pirit of <HI>&s;ociability</HI> ought to be <HI>univer&s;al</HI>&mdash;that we ought to have the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition towards other men, as we de&s;ire they &s;hould have towards us&mdash;that we &s;hould behave in the &s;ame manner towards other men, as we would be willing they &s;hould behave to|wards us in the like circum&s;tances&mdash;that we &s;hould pre&s;erve a benevolence even towards our <HI>enemies</HI>&mdash;that although the <HI>exerci&s;e</HI> of benevolence towards our enemies may from nece&s;&s;ity be <HI>&s;u&s;pended,</HI> yet we are not allowed to <HI>&s;tifle</HI> its principle; that revenge introducing, in&s;tead of benevolence, a &s;entiment of hatred and animo&s;ity is condemned; becau&s;e &s;uch a &s;entiment is vicious in it&s;elf, and contrary to the public good.</NOTE> amiable precepts of the law of nature, are as obligatory on nations in their mutual intercour&s;e, as they are on individuals in their conduct towards each other; and that every nation is bound to con|tribute all in its power to the happine&s;s and perfec|tion of others! What more eminently di&s;tingui&s;hes the refined and poli&s;hed nations of Europe, from the piratical &s;tates of Barbary, than a <HI>re&s;pect</HI> or a <HI>contempt</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="018773_0022_0FA8192719B832B0">
for this law. Books therefore which treat of the law of nations have always been received with avi|dity and applau&s;e.</P>
<P>The principal authorities adduced in this cau&s;e, are from Grotius, Puffendorff, Wolfius, Burla|maqui and Vattel.</P>
<P><HI>Grotius,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A profe&s;&s;or of the law at <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">roningen.</NOTE> in his book <HI>de jure belli et pacis,</HI> profe&s;&s;es to treat of but a &s;mall part of the law of nations&mdash; marriage&mdash;the power of fathers &mdash;ma&s;ters&mdash;and &s;ove|reigns&mdash;promi&s;es&mdash;contracts&mdash;oaths&mdash;treaties&mdash;amba&s;&s;a|dors &mdash;burials&mdash;puni&s;hments&mdash;peace and war.</P>
<P>Commentators have ob&s;erved, that tho' this ce|lebrated work contains many excellent precepts, it is neither methodical nor comprehen&s;ive.</P>
<P>Puffendorff next compo&s;ed his treati&s;e, <HI>de jure na|turae et gentium,</HI> in which we find more order, and great erudition: But it has been ob&s;erved, that this work is not free from error, and that the author has not &s;hewn how the civil does not de&s;troy <HI>natural</HI> &s;o|ciety; and that the <HI>latter</HI> only &s;erves to perfect the <HI>former.</HI></P>
<P>We are informed, that to illu&s;trate this was at|tempted by <HI>Wol&s;ius;</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The great Saxon philo&s;opher.</NOTE> and after him by <HI>Burlamaqui.</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Profe&s;&s;or of civil and natural law at Geneva.</NOTE> This la&s;t work, &s;ays a writer, is evidently rather an <HI>introduction</HI> than a <HI>&s;y&s;tem;</HI> and it &s;erved only to ex|cite a de&s;ire to &s;ee it continued with equal per&s;picu|ity and elegance. The honor of this ta&s;k was re|&s;erved for the great Vattel, who&s;e work is entitled to the highe&s;t admiration? He mode&s;tly takes Wol|fius for his guide; but in numberle&s;s pa&s;&s;ages cor|rects, abridges and improves him. What Wolfius has diffu&s;ed into fourteen volumes, our author has contracted into one; at the &s;ame time that his rea|&s;onings
<PB N="23" REF="018773_0023_0FA81927D74FBA48">
are clear and &s;atisfactory, and carry nothing of the dryne&s;s of an abridgment.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee, that the writers on the law of na|tions are di&s;tingui&s;hed philo&s;ophers, of different countries and ages; &s;ome educated in <HI>republics;</HI> &s;ome in <HI>monarchies;</HI> &s;ome at a time when <HI>prejudice,</HI> and an ignorance of the rights of mankind prevailed; and others when <HI>philo&s;ophy</HI> had refined the rea&s;on, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ubdued the fiercer pa&s;&s;ions of the hu|man mind.</P>
<P>Hence it can be no more an objection or re|proach to the law of nations, than it is to any other &s;cience (for all partake of imperfection)&mdash;that a dif|ference of &s;entiments and opinions &s;hould be di&s;covered among different authors!&mdash;A further u&s;e intended by the&s;e ob&s;ervations, is to ju&s;tify the preference, which we &s;hall give to Mr. Vattel, in points where we &s;hall find him at variance with other writers.</P>
<P>But to return from this digre&s;&s;ion, to the argu|ments before us: It has been objected by one of the Plaintiff's coun&s;el, that the&s;e &s;tates are not bound by the <HI>cu&s;tomary and voluntary law of nations,</HI> any fur|ther than as either of them, has adopted or engrafted them.</P>
<P>But the objection has been fully an&s;wered: By our excellent con&s;titution, the common law is de|clared to be part of the law of the land; and the <HI>jus gentium</HI> is a branch of the common law. <HI>In re|publica maxime con&s;ervandi &s;ut jura belli,</HI> is an ancient adage.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Co L. p. 11, b. Black. 4, p. 67, Burr. 3 vol. p. 14 30.</NOTE>The authorities cited on this point for the Defendant are full and conclu|&s;ive.</P>
<P>Indeed if we &s;hould not recogni&s;e the law of na|tions,
<PB N="24" REF="018773_0024_0FA8192895338550">
neither ought the benefit of that law to be ex|tended to us: and it would follow that out <HI>commerce,</HI> and our <HI>per&s;ons,</HI> in foreign parts, would be unpro|tected by the great &s;anctions, which it has enjoin|ed.&mdash;</P>
<P>After being thus explicit, it is almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary to touch a more limited que&s;tion, of the &s;ame na|ture, which has been debated in the cour&s;e of the arguments, viz.</P>
<P>Whether the common laws of war which apply to <HI>two great nations,</HI> apply to <HI>two great parts</HI> of the &s;ame nation?</P>
<P>The manner in which Mr. Vattel treats this que&s;|tion, is highly &s;atisfactory; and humanity forbids, that his principles &s;hould be ever called in que&s;tion!</P>
<P>When a nation becomes divided into two parties ab&s;olutely independent, and no longer acknowledg|ing a common &s;uperior, the &s;tate is <HI>di&s;&s;olved;</HI> and the war betwixt the <HI>two parties,</HI> in every re&s;pect, is the &s;ame with that of a public war, <HI>between two dif|ferent nations.</HI> Independent of each other, they can have no <HI>judge;</HI> like two different nations, they ap|peal to the <HI>ultima ratio regum</HI>&mdash;they decide the quar|rel by arms&mdash;were it not for the re&s;traints impo&s;ed by the law of nations, &s;uch a civil war would be be|yond expre&s;&s;ion cruel and de&s;tructive. Ha&s;ty pu|ni&s;hments, in the moment of rage and animo&s;ity, would mark its progre&s;s with inju&s;tice, &s;laughter and de&s;olation.</P>
<P>But alas! have the re&s;traints of that benevolent law protected our country in the late war, from the mi&s;eries we have de&s;cribed? They have not!&mdash;Ven|geance unre&s;trained, and undi&s;tingui&s;hed, hath been let loo&s;e upon us in all her horrors!</P>

<P>What <HI>we</HI> have &s;uffered cannot alter the common laws of war: they are founded upon rea&s;on and hu|manity, and will prevail as long as rea&s;on and huma|nity are cultivated. As philo&s;ophy and the love of mankind extend them&s;elves, the&s;e beneficial in&s;titu|tions will, we tru&s;t, be &s;till further improved, to con|troul the human pa&s;&s;ions, and mitigate the a&s;perities of war; till in the end ho&s;tilities &s;hall be bani&s;hed from the world, as di&s;graceful to our nature.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ancients it is remarked, were impre&s;&s;ed with but a very faint idea of the law of nations. Some are of opinion, that it had its origin in the reign of Charlemagne, about the middle of the eighth century, before which time the nations of Europe, but little civilized, ob&s;erved few treaties: Others fix it at a much later period, affirming that all knowledge of the &s;cience be|fore the reign of Maximilian I&s;t. (about the beginning of the &s;ixteenth cen|tury) is rather matter of curio&s;ity than in&s;truction.

<Q>of ob&s;erving the common laws of war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vatt. b. 3, p. 111, la&s;t clau&s;e of &sect; 3.</NOTE> is therefore <HI>ab&s;olute indi&s;pen&s;i|ble</HI> to both parties; and the &s;ame which the law of nature <HI>obliges all nations</HI> to ob&s;erve between &s;tate and &s;tate.</Q></P>
<P>And here it is que&s;tioned, whether &s;ince the law of nations is obligatory, it may in any part be alter|ed by a particular &s;ociety, &s;o as to deprive a foreign|er, when re&s;iding in that country, of his appeal to them?</P>
<P>The Defendant's coun&s;el deny, that in <HI>theory,</HI> a particular &s;tate hath &s;uch a right. They rai&s;e this di&s;tinction, that where there is merely an infringe|ment of the <HI>local law,</HI> foreigners like all others, mu&s;t

be judged by that law: But where the tran&s;action originally affects a man's conduct, as <HI>a member of a foreign nation,</HI> he may appeal to the law of nations, and by that law, which is part of the law of the land, the thing mu&s;t be decided.</P>
<P>And they con&s;ider the foederal compact as giving additional force to this re&s;traint&mdash;</P>
<P>In &s;upport of this rea&s;oning, a pa&s;&s;age from the elements of juri&s;prudence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Elem. Juri&s;p. page 62.</NOTE> is cited to this effect:</P>
<P>"States like the individuals who compo&s;e them, are moral per&s;ons, they have a public will and un|der&s;tanding, are capable of natural and acquired rights, and &s;u&s;ceptible of re&s;pective obligations. The <HI>primary</HI> law of nations therefore is no other than the <HI>law of nature,</HI> &s;o far as it is applicable to them. Whatever, in this behalf, rea&s;on dictates is a duty of natural ju&s;tice, from the nece&s;&s;ary law of nations."</P>
<P>Thus far we could agree with the profe&s;&s;or, that to &s;tate can by its &s;eparate ordinance, prejudice any <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of &s;uch a law&mdash;nay, that all the &s;tates of the world united could not; becau&s;e being of moral obligation, it is immutable.

<P>But Vattel treating of the <HI>nece&s;&s;ary law of nations</HI>&mdash; which Grotius calls the <HI>internal law of nations,</HI> and &s;e|veral others the <HI>natural law of nations,</HI> u&s;es the&s;e &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>"Since then the <HI>nece&s;&s;ary law of nations</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in the application of the law of nature to &s;tates, and is

<HI>immutable,</HI> as being founded on the <HI>nature of things,</HI>&mdash; and in particular on the nature of man: It follows, that the nece&s;&s;ary law of nations is immutable, and whence, &s;ays he, as this law is immutable, the obligations that ari&s;e from it <HI>nece&s;&s;ary and indi&s;|pen&s;able,</HI> nations can neither make any change in it, by their <HI>conventions,</HI> di&s;pen&s;e with it <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> nor <HI>reciprocally</HI> with re&s;pect to each other.</P>
<P>The re&s;traint then of which the lecturer &s;peaks is not perhaps &s;o general, as he teaches; for accor|ding to Mr. Vattel, it &s;eems only to be applicable to <HI>laws of moral obligation.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vattel, p. 2 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now we know, that there are u&s;ages of nations which are indifferent, and which, as Mr. Vattel ob|&s;erves, different &s;tates may agree to e&s;tabli&s;h by trea|ty, or introduce by cu&s;tom, at their plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to &s;uch u&s;ages, it might perhaps have been con&s;idered that every nation by the law of nature, is free and independent of all foreign and external controul; but if one nation mu&s;t be &s;ub|jected, at all events, to u&s;ages which &s;he cannot ap|prove, becau&s;e others may have thought fit to adopt them, her liberty would no longer remain entire.</P>
<P>The u&s;age of ran&s;oming captures at &s;ea &s;eems to have been dictated by a &s;pirit of benevolence; it fa|voured per&s;onal liberty; it afforded &s;ome alleviations to the misfortune of the captive merchant and ma|riner, who, unconnected with the war, were in|terrupted in the pur&s;uit of their private concerns; it was an u&s;age which, we believe, every poli&s;hed na|tion adopted: Neverthele&s;s, when Great-Britain con|ceived, that this u&s;age did not corre&s;pond with her intere&s;t, her Parliament did not he&s;itate to abrogate it; for by a &s;tatute pa&s;&s;ed &s;o lately as 1782, it is made unlawful for any Briti&s;h &s;ubject to ran&s;om his &s;hip or effects when captured, "and all contracts

and agreements which &s;hall be entered into, and all bills and other &s;ecurities which &s;hall be given to any per&s;on or per&s;ons, &s;hall be ab&s;olutely void."</P>
<P>It cannot be &s;aid, that this is a law operating only on the &s;ubjects of the Briti&s;h &s;tate. All commer|cial nations appear to be intere&s;ted in the u&s;age; it was a benefit to the <HI>captor</HI> as well as the <HI>captive;</HI> nor is any provi&s;ion made for ran&s;om bills, which might have taken effect before the law could be promul|gated to the different parts of the world.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doug.

<P>This circum&s;tance proves, at lea&s;t, that the Bri|ti&s;h nation did not con&s;ider it&s;elf bound by the broad principles laid down by the lecturer.</P>
<P>Time will not permit us to give this &s;ubject a ful|ler di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t acknowledge there appears to us very great force in the ob&s;ervation ari&s;ing from the foede|ral compact. By this compact the&s;e &s;tates are bound together as one great independent nation; and with re&s;pect to their common and national affairs, exerci&s;e a joint &s;overeignty, who&s;e will can only be mani|fe&s;ted by the acts of their delegates in Congre&s;s a&s;|&s;embled. As a nation they mu&s;t be governed by one common law of nations; for on any other prin|ciples how can they act with regard to foreign pow|ers; and how &s;hall foreign powers act towards them? It &s;eems evident that <HI>abroad</HI> they can only be known in their foederal capacity. What then mu&s;t be the ef|fect? What the confu&s;ion? if each &s;eparate &s;tate &s;hould arrogate to it&s;elf a right of changing at plea|&s;ure tho&s;e laws, which are received as a rule of con|duct, by the common con&s;ent of the greate&s;t part of the civilized world.</P>
<P>We &s;hall deduce only one inference from what
<PB N="29" REF="018773_0029_0FA8192DD6EF1800">
hath been here ob&s;erved&mdash;that to abrogate or alter any one of the known laws or u&s;ages of nations, by the authority of a &s;ingle &s;tate, mu&s;t be contrary to the very nature of the confederacy, and the evident intention of the articles, by which it is e&s;tabli&s;hed, as well as dangerous to the union it&s;elf.</P>
<P>We are next led by the arguments which have been offered, to examine&mdash;whether the <HI>war</HI> was of &s;uch a <HI>nature;</HI> and the capture &s;uch a <HI>conque&s;t</HI> as ab|&s;olutely to transfer, under the idea of an u&s;ufruct, the rents and i&s;&s;ues of hou&s;es and lands to the Bri|ti&s;h Commander, during his occupancy of the city?</P>
<P>On the part of the Plaintiff it is in&s;i&s;ted, that the war which was waged again&s;t us by Great-Britain was <HI>unju&s;t.</HI> As a matter of fact this cannot be denied&mdash;the honour of every American is con|cerned in its e&s;tabli&s;hment. Every patriot knows and feels it. Upon account of the inju&s;tice of the war, he renounced his allegiance and committed his fortune and his life to uncertain hazard. Upon account of the inju&s;tice of the war, Lord Chatham exclaimed in the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Peers that he rejoiced America had re&s;i&s;ted.&mdash;Again&s;t the inju&s;tice of the war Lord Cambden and his compeers prote&s;ted; and the great cities of England it&s;elf re|mon&s;trated: And finally, on account of the inju&s;tice of the war, even the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons, in &s;pite of the influence of the court, re&s;olved again&s;t its further pro&s;ecution.&mdash;And it is not too pre&s;umptuous to think that upon account of its in|ju&s;tice, all the a&s;toni&s;hing efforts to &s;ubdue our coun|try were bla&s;ted by the hand of Heaven!</P>

<P>Without entering into a minute examination of the rea&s;ons and authorities, by which the parties have attempted to maintain opinions &s;o oppo&s;ite to each other; we &s;hall con&s;ider the &s;ubject in a more enlarged view.</P>
<P>It is a maxim founded in rea&s;on and humanity, that the re&s;toration of peace, whatever may be the cau&s;e of a war, ought always to be in contemplation. Every impediment then, which might retard this ble&s;&s;ing, ought to be di&s;countenanced&mdash;every faci|lity which could promote it, encouraged; in pro|portion as the refinements of civilization enlighten|ed mankind, it was to be expected that the law of nations, fo&s;tered and cheri&s;hed by philo&s;ophers, &s;hould become more benevolent, and more &s;uitable to the dignity and happine&s;s of man. Hence the doctrine, that the &s;olemnity and ju&s;tice of a war were e&s;&s;ential in a&s;certaining the rights acquired as the effects of war, came to be exploded; becau&s;e experience had fully proved, that it was productive of mi&s;chief. The &s;hedding of human blood, and the ruin of families and countries could be but poor|ly compen&s;ated by the mo&s;t humiliating conce&s;&s;ions; while &s;uch is the influence of pride and ambition, that two nations, equally convinced that it is their duty and their intere&s;t to embrace an accommodati|on, often &s;uffer the calamities of war to rage only
<PB N="32" REF="018773_0032_0FA819301B1A9940">
from the fear of being degraded, by making the fir&s;t advances towards peace. They wait for &s;ome &s;plen|did victory, which may never happen, to have an opportunity of manife&s;ting their &s;uperiority, and of oppo&s;ing what is nece&s;&s;ary to their affairs, as an act of <HI>genero&s;ity.</HI></P>
<P>If then every treaty of peace was to be determin|ed only by the preci&s;e rules of ju&s;tice: If it mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily be acknowledged on one &s;ide, that the cau&s;e of the war was, on their part, unju&s;t, or ho&s;tilities were commenced by them without tho&s;e previ|ous &s;olemnities which have once been deemed e&s;&s;en|tial; where is the nation which would confe&s;s their wantonne&s;s or inju&s;tice? or where the tribunal to who&s;e arbitration they would &s;ubmit their honour? It is therefore for the happine&s;s of mankind; found|ed, in a manner, in nece&s;&s;ity, that in a treaty of peace neither party &s;hould be condemned for, or be bound to acknowledge, precipitancy, or the want of &s;olemnity, in certain formalities in the commence|ment of the war; and much le&s;s the inju&s;tice of their cau&s;e; and that the odium of all the blood which had been &s;hed, was imputable to them. This would be to &s;ub&s;cribe to an indelible di&s;grace, to which a &s;overeign power very &s;eldom would con&s;ent, and ne|ver but in the la&s;t extremity. If then it is plain, that no acknowledgment of &s;uch a nature can be &s;ti|pulated in a treaty, and there is no tribunal to judge between &s;overeign powers, all enquiry into the ju&s;|tice or &s;olemnity of a war mu&s;t cea&s;e, and tho&s;e facts be incapable of &s;ervings the ba&s;is of a precept&mdash;. in &s;hort, that they can be no otherwi&s;e material, than <HI>in foro con&s;cientiae.</HI>&mdash;The&s;e ob&s;ervation are ju&s;tified by the authority of Mr. Vattel; they are corroborated

<P>What I have ob&s;erved, &s;ays Grotius, of lands, takes place al&s;o in my opinion in regard to all rights annexed to tho&s;e lands. <HI>Upon this principle it mu&s;t be &s;aid, that the profits of the land recovered are to be re&s;tored;</HI> and he refers to a formal deci&s;ion of the civilian Pau|lus, in the point.</P>

<P>The two authorities quoted from Grotius, and on each &s;ide of the que&s;tion, &s;eem at the fir&s;t view, to be repugnant; but on an attentive examination it will appear otherwi&s;e: In the fir&s;t ca&s;e he is &s;peaking of profits of <HI>lands to be re&s;tored.</HI> He conceives, that
<PB N="35" REF="018773_0035_0FA81934526C6670">
the profits of &s;uch lands ought to be recovered on ac|count of the antecedent right of &s;oil to which they were annexed.</P>
<P>But in the la&s;t ca&s;e, he &s;peaks of a <HI>new right,</HI> grant|ed by the articles of peace, which had no prior ex|i&s;tence, there he &s;ays the profits &s;hall be allowed from the time of the grant, <HI>and not before.</HI> That this di&s;|tinction is ju&s;t will appear from a view of the whole of the la&s;t authority:</P>
<P>To whom any thing is granted by articles of peace, to him are al&s;o all the profits allowed from the time of the grant <HI>but not before;</HI> then follows this pa&s;&s;age which explains the &s;en&s;e of the author&mdash; "As Au|gu&s;tus Cae&s;ar well argued again&s;t Sextus Pompeius, who having Peleponne&s;us granted to him, would have al&s;o had all the tributes, which <HI>were in arrear</HI> for &s;ome years pa&s;t before the time of that grant."</P>
<P>Thus Grotius is at unity with him&s;elf: But it is not in our power to reconcile him to Vattel. The&s;e authors differ in their opinions with re&s;pect to the re&s;titution after peace, of the fruits collected by a captor during the war. Be&s;ides this, which is un|der con&s;ideration, there are &s;everal &s;trong pa&s;&s;ages in Vattel, which corroborate the &s;ame doctrine; and it receives additional force from the authority of Burlamaqui and of Barbeyrac in his notes upon Grotius.</P>
<P>We are therefore of opinion, that re&s;titution of the <HI>fruit,</HI> or in other words, the rents and i&s;&s;ues of hou&s;es and lands, which have been <HI>bona fide,</HI> collect|ed by or under the authority of the Briti&s;h Com|mander, while he held po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city, can|not, <HI>according to the law of nations,</HI> be required.</P>

of any other contribution exacted by a conqueror in the cour&s;e of a war; and the right of demanding contributions in &s;uch ca&s;e, hath, we believe, never been que&s;tioned.&mdash;With re&s;pect to the products, which might be due on the conclu&s;ion of a peace, they mu&s;t cea&s;e to be recoverable by the captor af|ter the re&s;toration of the town, unle&s;s the treaty &s;hould provide for it by an expre&s;s &s;tipulation.</P>
<P>But this doctrine in its fulle&s;t extent will prove no effectual relief to the Defendant.

<PB N="37" REF="018773_0037_0FA819370E5D6DE0">
The effect of it is to put an end to the war, and to aboli&s;h the &s;ubject of it: as it forbids the revival of the &s;ame war, by taking up arms for the cau&s;e which fir&s;t enkindled it, it is in reality perpetual.</P>
<P>An amne&s;ty is a <HI>perfect</HI> oblivion of what is pa&s;t, and the end of peace being to extingui&s;h all &s;ubjects of di&s;cord, this &s;hould be the leading article of the treaty. This accordingly, &s;ays Vattel, at pre&s;ent is the con&s;tant rule.</P>
<P>But tho' the treaty, he adds, &s;hould be wholly &s;i|lent on this head, the amne&s;ty, by the <HI>very nature of the peace,</HI> is nece&s;&s;arily implied in it.</P>
<P>In another pa&s;&s;age, he ob&s;erves, that the effect of the amne&s;ty, cannot be extended <HI>to things of no relati|on to the war</HI> concluded by the treaty.</P>
<P>The&s;e principles are well e&s;tabli&s;hed by the law of nations; and they are even admitted by the coun|&s;el for the Plaintiff.</P>
<P>But it is objected, on their part, that the occu|pation of the tenements in que&s;tion by the Defend|ant, <HI>had no relation to the war;</HI> and that therefore the amne&s;ty cannot acquit him.</P>
<P>This objection has been fully con&s;idered; and we have given an opinion that the term for which the tenements were held by the permi&s;&s;ion of the Com|mi&s;&s;ary General can, on no con&s;truction, <HI>have a re|lation to the war:</HI></P>
<P>The amne&s;ty implied in the treaty cannot there|fore ju&s;tify the Defendant; for all the authorities prove, that it can be only extended <HI>to things done in re|lation to the war.</HI></P>
<P>The parties have indeed joined their i&s;&s;ues upon other points, upon which, if the cau&s;e had entirely re&s;ted, judgment ought to have been given.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="018773_0038_0FA81937B804A708">
<Q>But it is a known rule, that if upon the whole record, matter in law appear why judgment &s;hould be given again&s;t one party, the court mu&s;t judge &s;o, for it is the office of the court to judge the law upon the whole record, and the con&s;ent of parties cannot prejudice their opinions, nor acquit them of their office in that point.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hob. 56.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>It has been further objected, that Congre&s;s could form no treaty of peace to reach our <HI>internal</HI> police.</P>
<P>There is a great di&s;tinction between the authority of the treaty; and its operation and effects.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t we hold to be &s;acred and &s;hall never, as far as we have power, &s;uffer it to be violated or que&s;|tioned.</P>
<P>It is the great charter of America&mdash;it has formal|ly and forever relea&s;ed us from foreign domination&mdash; It has confirmed our &s;overeignty and independence; and a&s;certained our exten&s;ive limits.</P>
<P>Our union as has been properly ob&s;erved, is known and legalized in our con&s;titution; and adopt|ed as a fundamental law in the fir&s;t act of our legi&s;|lature. The foederal compact hath ve&s;ted Congre&s;s with full and exclu&s;ive powers to make peace and war. This treaty they have made and ratified, and rendered its obligation perpetual.</P>
<P>And we are clearly of opinion, that no &s;tate in this union can alter or abridge, in a &s;ingle point, the foederal articles or the treaty:</P>
<P>But the operation and effects of the treaty, within our own &s;tate, are fit &s;ubjects of enquiry and deci|&s;ion: According to its &s;pirit and true meaning we mu&s;t determine our judgment: Nor &s;hall any man, by any act of ours, be deprived of the benefits which, on a fair and rea&s;onable con&s;truction, he ought to derive from it.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="018773_0039_0FA819386580F3C0">On this occa&s;ion, we &s;ay with the &s;age&mdash;<HI>fiat ju&s;titia ruat coelum.</HI></P>
<P>We cannot, it is urged by the Defendant's coun|&s;el, impo&s;e a &s;en&s;e upon the treaty different from that which it intrin&s;ically bears. "The rules re|ceived among nations mu&s;t interpret treaties."</P>
<P>This is an unnece&s;&s;ary ob&s;ervation: No di&s;pute hath ari&s;en re&s;pecting the intrin&s;ic &s;en&s;e of the treaty: The Plaintiff's coun&s;el repeatedly in&s;i&s;ted that the article of the treaty which re&s;pected an indemnity related to <HI>public offences</HI> &mdash;the Defendant's coun&s;el in an&s;wer frankly confe&s;&s;ed, that though that article was mentioned by <HI>one</HI> of them, it was <HI>not relied on.</HI> That they re&s;ted on two things; one, the <HI>right</HI> which the law of <HI>nations</HI> gives the <HI>captors;</HI> the other the <HI>amne&s;ty</HI> included e&s;&s;entially in every treaty, whether expre&s;&s;ed or not, agreeably to the current of autho|rities, and the rea&s;on of the thing.</P>
<P>It is then an implied and not an <HI>expre&s;s</HI> amne&s;ty, on which the Defendant relies; an amne&s;ty which nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ults from every treaty of peace&mdash;And thus, the intrin&s;ic &s;en&s;e of the treaty and the rules for its interpretation are out of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>We have in &s;ome mea&s;ure anticipated another que&s;tion, which was much debated at the hearing&mdash;</P>
<P>Whether the courts of ju&s;tice ought to be govern|ed by the <HI>&s;tatute,</HI> where it clearly militated again&s;t the law of nations.</P>
<P>Here it is material to ob&s;erve that the <HI>de&s;cription of per&s;ons,</HI> who are &s;ubject to be &s;ued by this &s;tatute is <HI>general;</HI> extending to all who had occupied or in|jured the real or per&s;onal e&s;tate of the exiles, with|in the power of the enemy.</P>
<P>The coun&s;el for the Defendant, by &s;tating a num|ber

of pointed ca&s;es, &s;hewed clearly, from the nature of things, that the &s;tatute mu&s;t admit of exceptions. Mr. Attorney-General, one of the coun&s;el for the Plaintiff, who argued the cau&s;e very ably, admitted that many ca&s;es may be out of the &s;tatute, tho' the Plaintiff's is not of the number.</P>
<P>Thus then, it &s;eems to be agreed, on both &s;ides, that the provi&s;ion in the &s;tatute, being general, can|not extend to all <HI>ca&s;es:</HI> and mu&s;t therefore receive a <HI>rea&s;onable interpretation</HI> according to the <HI>intention;</HI> and not according to the <HI>lattitude of expre&s;&s;ion</HI> of the le|gi&s;lature: It follows as a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, that the interpretation is the province of the court, and, however difficult the ta&s;k, that we are bound to perform it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hob. 346</NOTE>The authorities which have been cited on the part of the Defend|ant, not only e&s;tabli&s;h this gene|ral principle; but bring forward a number of judicial deci&s;ions, wherein the courts of ju&s;tice have exerci&s;ed that power.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Plowd. 109.

<P>However contradictory the&s;e authorities may ap|pear to &s;uperficial ob&s;ervers; they are not only ca|pable
<PB N="41" REF="018773_0041_0FA81939D9568AB0">
of being reconciled; but the re&s;ult of the whole will appear to be wi&s;e, &s;uited to human im|perfection and ea&s;ily explained.</P>
<P>The &s;upremacy of the Legi&s;lature need not be called into que&s;tion; if they think fit <HI>po&s;itively</HI> to enact a law, there is no power which can controul them. When the main object of &s;uch a law is clearly ex|pre&s;&s;ed, and the intention manife&s;t, the Judges are not at liberty, altho' it appears to them to be <HI>unrea|&s;onable,</HI> to reject it: for this were to &s;et the <HI>judicial</HI> above the legi&s;lative, which would be &s;ubver&s;ive of all government.</P>
<P>But when a law is expre&s;&s;ed in <HI>general words,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>collateral matter,</HI> which happens to ari&s;e from tho&s;e general words is <HI>unrea&s;onable,</HI> there the Judges are in decency to conclude, that the con&s;equences were not fore&s;een by the Legi&s;lature; and therefore they are at liberty to expound the &s;tatute by <HI>equity,</HI> and only <HI>quoad hoc</HI> to di&s;regard it.</P>
<P>When the judicial make the&s;e di&s;tinctions, they do not controul the Legi&s;lature; they endeavour to give their <HI>intention</HI> it's proper effect.</P>
<P>This is the &s;ub&s;tance of the authorities, on a comprehen&s;ive view of the &s;ubject; this is the lan|guage of Black&s;tone in his celebrated commentaries, and this is the practice of the courts of ju&s;tice, from which we have copied our juri&s;prudence, as well as the models of our own internal judicatories. To apply the&s;e general remarks to the particular ca&s;e under our con&s;ideration&mdash;The American pri&s;oners of war, in the power of the enemy, were quartered in the hou&s;es of the exiles: they in fact occupied tho&s;e hou&s;es by a <HI>military order or command,</HI> and are inclu|ded within the general de&s;cription of the &s;tatute,
<PB N="42" REF="018773_0042_0FA8193AA73E4F78">
which according to the letter, extends to <HI>all per&s;ons</HI> without any exception, who have &s;o occupied or in|jured &s;uch hou&s;es. But can we force our&s;elves to believe, that the Legi&s;lature could have been &s;o un|ju&s;t and oppre&s;&s;ive, as to add to the &s;ufferings of the patriot &s;oldier, con&s;igned after fighting the battles of his country, to a long captivity by making him pay for the fetters, which he had worn in the &s;ervice of his country, or for want of means, to undergo a &s;econd lo&s;s of liberty?</P>
<P>That the legi&s;lative, judicial and executive pow|ers of government &s;hould be independent of each other, is e&s;&s;ential to liberty.</P>
<P>This principle entered deeply into our excellent con&s;titution, and was one of the inducements to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Council of Revi&s;ion, that the judicial and executive of whom it is compo&s;ed, might have the means of guarding their re&s;pective rights, again&s;t the encroachments of the Ligi&s;lature, whe|ther by de&s;ign, "or by ha&s;te or unadvi&s;edne&s;s." For this and other purpo&s;es, all bills, which have pa&s;&s;ed the Senate and A&s;&s;embly, before they become laws, are to be pre&s;ented to the Council for their revi&s;al and con&s;ideration; that if it &s;hould appear impro|per to them, that any bill &s;hould become a law, it may be returned with their objections for further con&s;ideration, and become &s;ubject to the approbati|on of two-thirds of the members of each hou&s;e, be|fore it can be a law.</P>
<P>From this pa&s;&s;age of our con&s;titution, Mr. Attor|ney &s;eems to regard this determination of the Coun|cil of Revi&s;ion on the law in que&s;tion, in the light of a judicial deci&s;ion; by which this court ought to be guided, for the &s;ake of <HI>uniformity</HI> in the di&s;pen&s;a|tion
<PB N="43" REF="018773_0043_0FA8193B56009D38">
of ju&s;tice. But &s;urely the re&s;pect, which we owe to this honourable Council, ought not to carry us &s;uch lengths; it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that their a&s;&s;entor objection to a bill, can have the force of an adjudication: for what in &s;uch a ca&s;e, would be the fate of a law, which prevailed again&s;t their &s;enti|ments? Be&s;ides in the hurry of a &s;e&s;&s;ion, and e&s;pe|cially &s;lagrante bello, they have neither lei&s;ure nor means, to weigh the extent and con&s;equences of a law, who&s;e provi&s;ions are general, at lea&s;t not with that accuracy and &s;olemnity, which mu&s;t be nece&s;&s;a|ry to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ender their rea&s;ons incontrovertible, and their opinions ab&s;olute. The in&s;titution of this Council is &s;ufficiently u&s;eful and &s;alutary, without a&s;cribing to their proceedings, effects &s;o extraordinary; nor is it probable, that the high judicial powers them|&s;elves, would in the &s;eat of judgment always be pre|cluded, even by their <HI>own</HI> opinion given in the Council of Revi&s;ion;&mdash;for in&s;tance, if they had con|&s;ented to a bill, <HI>general in its provi&s;ion,</HI> and in the ad|mini&s;tration of ju&s;tice they di&s;covered, that accor|ding to the letter, it comprehended ca&s;es, which rendered its operation <HI>un&s;ea&s;onable, mi&s;chievous</HI> and <HI>con|trary to the intention</HI> of the Legi&s;lature, would they not give relief? &s;urely it cannot be que&s;tioned.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, this being a &s;tatute is obligato|ry, and being general in its provi&s;ions, collateral matter ari&s;es out of the general words, which hap|pens to be un&s;ea&s;onable. The Court is therefore bound to conclude, that &s;uch a con&s;equence was not fore&s;een by the Legi&s;lature, to explain it by e|quity, and to di&s;regard it in that point <HI>only,</HI> where it would operate thus un&s;ea&s;onably.</P>
<P>The que&s;tions then, whether this &s;tatute hath <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">

any re&s;pect revoked the law of nations, or is repeal|ed by the definitive treaty of peace, are foreign to the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e: neither will happen, nor ought to be apprehended.</P>
<P>There is not a tittle in the treaty, to which the &s;tatute is repugnant. The <HI>amne&s;ty</HI> is con&s;tructive, and made out by rea&s;oning from the law of nations to the treaty.</P>
<P>The repeal of the law of nations, or any inter|ference with it, could not have been in contempla|tion, in our opinion, when the Legi&s;lature pa&s;&s;ed this &s;tatute; and we think our&s;elves bound to ex|empt that law from its operation: Fir&s;t, becau&s;e there is no mention of the law of nations, nor the mo&s;t remote allu&s;ion to it, throughout the whole &s;tatute: Secondly, becau&s;e it is a &s;ubject of the high|e&s;t national concern and of too much moment to have been <HI>intended</HI> to be &s;truck at in <HI>&s;ilence;</HI> and to be controuled <HI>implicatively</HI> under the generality of the terms of the provi&s;ion: Thirdly, becau&s;e the provi&s;i|on it&s;elf is &s;o indefinite, that without any controul, it would operate in other ca&s;es <HI>unrea&s;onably,</HI> to the <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>innocent,</HI> and contrary to <HI>humanity;</HI> when it is a known maxim
<Q>that a &s;tatute ought to be &s;o con&s;trued, that no man who is <HI>innocent</HI> be puni&s;hed or <HI>endamaged:</HI></Q>
Fourthly, be|cau&s;e the &s;tatute under our con&s;ideration, doth not contain even the common <HI>non ob&s;tante clau&s;e,</HI> tho' it is &s;o frequent in our &s;tatute book&mdash;"And it is an e&s;ta|bli&s;hed maxim, where two laws are &s;eemingly repug|nant, and there be no clau&s;e of non ob&s;tante in the latter, they &s;hall, if po&s;&s;ible, have &s;uch con&s;truction, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the latter may not repeal the former by implica|tion:" Fifthly, becau&s;e altho' it is a true rule, that

<P>It is a&s;ked by the Defendant's coun&s;el, whether if a per&s;on within the power of the enemy, had been ordered by them <HI>on pain of death,</HI> to injure or de&s;troy the property of an exile, he could have been &s;ued under this &s;tatute, for obeying &s;uch order?

&s;tatute. Whether the Briti&s;h Generals, Howe and Clinton can be pro&s;ecuted under it for damages which they have committed on the property of the exiles, in relation to the war? The principles, which we have lain down, clearly &s;hew that &s;uch ve&s;&s;els cannot be recovered: That tho&s;e Generals cannot be &s;ued; becau&s;e the&s;e are all acts done in <HI>relation to the war,</HI> which according to the law of nations, are virtually and effectual buried in oblivion by the definitive treaty: every &s;uch treaty in its very nature imply|ing a general amne&s;ty.</P>
<P>We have gone further perhaps into many impor|tant &s;ubjects, which have been brought into view by this controver&s;y, than was &s;trictly nece&s;&s;ary; but it is time that the law of nations and the nature and effects of treaties &s;hould be under&s;tood: And in the infancy of our republic, every proper opportunity &s;hould be embraced to inculcate a &s;en&s;e of national obligation, and a reverence for in&s;titutions, on which the tranquility of mankind, con&s;idered as members of different &s;tates and communities &s;o e&s;&s;entially de|pends.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the maxim <HI>intere&s;t reipublicae ut &s;it finis litium,</HI> never applied more forcibly, than it now doth to us in our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances; and it is hoped by be|ing thus explicit, we may ea&s;e the minds of a mul|titude of &s;uitors, who&s;e cau&s;es are depending here under this &s;tatute&mdash;at all events we &s;hall relieve this Court from an unu&s;ual weight of judicial ex|amination, which a want of time <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">enders incompa|tible with our other public and indi&s;pen&s;able duties.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it is the opinion of this Court, that the plea of the Defendant as to the occupancy of the Plaintiff's brew-hou&s;e and malt-hou&s;e, be|tween
