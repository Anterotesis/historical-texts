<P>WHEN they'd Travell'd a little way, <HI>Toby,</HI> an <HI>Indian</HI> falling Lame, was oblig'd to return, with great Reluctancy.</P>

<P>THEN they Travell'd as far as <HI>O&s;&s;apy,</HI> and there one <HI>Benjamin Kidder</HI> of <HI>Nutfield</HI> falling Sick; the Capt. made a Halt, and tarried while they built a &s;mall Fortification, for a place of Refuge to repair to, if there &s;hould be Occa&s;ion.

FROM the <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> before the Battle, the Com|pany were apprehen&s;ive they were Di&s;cover'd and Dog'd by the Enemy: And on <HI>Friday</HI> Night, the Watch heard the <HI>Indians</HI> about the Camp and Alarm'd the Company, but it being very Dark, they could make no further Di&s;covery.</P>
<P><HI>SATURDAY</HI> the Eighth of <HI>May,</HI> while they were at Prayers, very Early in the Morning, they heard a Gun; and &s;ometime after &s;py'd an <HI>Indian</HI> on a Point, that ran into <HI>Saco Pond.</HI></P>
<P>THEY now concluded that the de&s;ign of the Gun, &amp; of the <HI>Indian'</HI>s Di&s;covering him&s;elf, was to draw them that way: And expecting without fail to be Attack'd; It was now propo&s;ed, whether it were Prudent to venture an Engagement with the Enemy, (who they perceiv'd were now &s;ufficiently Alarmed,) or, endeavour a &s;peedy Retreat. The Men Gene|rally &amp; Boldly An&s;wered, <Q>We came out to meet the Enemy; we have all along Pray'd <HI>GOD</HI> we might find 'em; and we had rather tru&s;t Providence with our Lives, yea Dy for our Country, than try to Return without &s;eeing them, if we may, and be called Cowards for our Pains.</Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>Captain</HI> readily comply'd to lead them on, though not without Manife&s;ting &s;ome Apprehen&s;i|ons;&mdash;And (&s;uppo&s;ing the Enemy were a Head of 'em, when as it prov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d, they were in the Rear) Ordered the Men to lay down their Packs, &amp; March with greate&s;t Caution, and in utmo&s;t readine&s;s.</P>
<P>WHEN they'd March'd about a Mile and Half, or two Miles, En&s;ign <HI>Wyman</HI> &s;py'd an <HI>Indian</HI> com|ing toward them, whereupon he gave a Sign and they all &s;quat, and let him come on: pre&s;ently

<HI>Again,</HI> THE whole Poem is &s;ufficiently <HI>Brave</HI> and <HI>Manly.</HI> David &s;hows him&s;elf a Man of a great Soul now, that <HI>Saul'</HI>s day was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ome to die, &amp; GOD had delivered him out of his hands; and <HI>Saul</HI> could now no longer per&s;ecute and hunt him as a <HI>part|ridge</HI> on the Mountains, as he'd a long while done; (for as in the <HI>Grave</HI> the weary Servants of GOD, are at re&s;t, &s;o, Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD! when the Wicked are lodg'd <HI>there,</HI> they cea&s;e from troubling) I &s;ay tho' <HI>David</HI> was now delivered, he &s;corns to trample with in&s;ulting feet on the Monument of the Dead, and crow over a Breathle&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rp&s;e; But buries all the faults of <HI>Saul</HI> in perpetual oblivion, in the land of forgetfulne&s;s, lays a&s;ide all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pleen, and heartily mourns his Countrie's Reproach and Lo&s;s, tho' the very means of his own deliverance and advance|ment, (a Noble in&s;tance of Public Spiritedne&s;s) and commemorates what was commendable, even in <HI>Saul.</HI> For, <HI>De mortuis, nil ni&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> bonum.</HI> None that are Men after GOD'S own heart, will unnece&s;|&s;arily rip up the faults of others; and &s;peak evil of tho&s;e that can't &s;peak for them&s;elves.

<P>BUT then, it's al&s;o a <HI>Martial</HI> Poem: 'tis written with a Martial Air. The Subject is intirely Mili|tary. He Laments his Heroes, con&s;idered in their Military Character.

<P><HI>Furthermore,</HI> THIS Elegy is very <HI>Ancient.</HI> 'Twas written about Eight and Twenty Hundred Years ago.

<P><HI>Finally,</HI> TO remark no more Characters of this Poem, It's a <HI>Scripture</HI> Elegy: for tho' we don't &s;up|po&s;e it at fir&s;t written by in&s;piration; yet being a|greeable to the Will of GOD, was adopted (if I may &s;o expre&s;s it) by the Holy Spirit, who in&s;pired tho&s;e that in&s;erted it in the Sacred Pages, &s;o that it is now a part of Canonical Scripture.

many things out of the Book of <HI>Ja&s;her,</HI> being guided therein by the the unerring Spirit of GOD.

<P>Secondly, <HI>THE Fall of Brave and Succe&s;sful Soldiers is very much to be Lamented by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eople of GOD, e&s;pecially by tho&s;e in who&s;e immediate Service they Sacrific'd their Lives.</HI> For,</P>

It's Humane and Manly to do &s;o: but the contrary is indeed, inhumane, and wor&s;e than Heatheni&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> IT is Ju&s;t and Equal, for the Peo|ple of GOD to Lament the Death of Brave and Suc|ce&s;sful Soldiers Slain by their Enemies, and in their Service. Tears and proper Lamentations are a Debt we owe them. They've dearly merited this piece of Re&s;pect from their People. It's but ju&s;t, to &s;hed Tears for them, that have &s;hed their Hearts Blood for us. And &s;urely, if they de&s;erv'd the Applau&s;e and Commendation of all while they Liv'd; they ought to be Honour'd with the Lamentations
<PB N="14" REF="002706_0028_0FE60F5BE5508550">
of all when they're Slain in the high places of the Field. And the Law of Equity calls for it. Surely 'tis to do as we would be done by; or as we &s;hould de&s;ire any of our Dear Relatives &s;hould be treated, in like circum&s;tances. If it had been the Lot of any very nearly Related to us (and it has been &s;o<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Capt.</HI> Av<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">'<HI>s of</HI> Have<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hill; <HI>and Mr.</HI> Edward Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">leton <HI>of</HI> Bradford <HI>with &s;undry others.</HI> Aug. 29 1708 <HI>and the Au|thors Grandfather, and Un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> Graves <HI>in the</HI> Dutch War.</NOTE>) to be Slain in Battle, or Sea-Fight, playing the Man for their People, and for the Cities of their GOD; &s;urely a due notice taken of their Death, by the People of GOD, would be what we &s;hould expect and be plea&s;ed with. Now what&s;oever we would that men &s;hould do to us, we &s;hould do the &s;ame to them; or, we tran&s;gre&s;s a Golden Rule. But if this Rule be out of fa&s;hion with any; yet</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> AGREABLE Lamentations for Expert and Succe&s;sful Soldiers Slain in War, are very u&s;eful and advantagious. It's a Comfort to their Bereaved Relatives, when they ob&s;erve that the People of GOD do greatly bewail the Death of their Friends, and heartily Sympathize with them, tho' their Lo&s;s may po&s;&s;ibly be in &s;ome re&s;pects Irreparable; yet <HI>this</HI> &s;hould and will contribute not a little, to alleviate their &s;orrow, ea&s;e their di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed minds, and dry up their Tears.</P>
<P>AND then, its a Spur to Virtue. When Survi|ving Soldiers (and particularly &s;uch as have been Eye-Witne&s;&s;es of the Fall of their Brethren, and fought with uncommon Bravery, and were either Wounded, or Equally Expo&s;ed in the &s;ame Battle,
<PB N="15" REF="002706_0029_0FE60EDC9B88DBD0">
with tho&s;e that are Slain) take Notice that the Death of their Officers or Fellow-Soldiers is deeply re&s;ented by the People of GOD, that they &s;till &s;peak of them with great Honour in their Lamentations; this will Animate them, we hope, to do Worthily, and rather Die with Honour, if call'd to Battle, than live with Di&s;grace; and for their Cowardice, have the offer of a <HI>Wooden Sword,</HI> and be Branded with the Infamous Character of <HI>Cowards,</HI> even by the Weaker Sex.</P>
<P>WHEREAS, on the other hand, it's a great Ag|gravation of the Affliction of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Mourners, when they ob&s;erve that the Generality only give the News of their Friends Death, the hearing, but &s;eem as Stoical and unconcern'd about it, as if their Lives were of no value, and their Death what does no way concern them. Such Ingratitude and Inhumanity is very Exerci&s;ing to Ingenious minds and &s;uch as have any &s;en&s;e of Honour. Be&s;ides &s;uch a Sordid In&s;en&s;iblene&s;s is very Di&s;couraging to our Brave Soldiers. Who would be willing to venture their Lives for &s;uch ungrateful People!</P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> IT<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">S Pious and Scriptural to bewail the Death of &s;uch Brave and Succe&s;sful Soldiers, who&s;e Lot it is to be Slain at la&s;t in the Field of Battle.

If the <HI>Lion</HI> roar, who will not tremble? but alas, who can &s;tand when GOD is angry! And he highly re&s;ents it, when his people are in&s;en&s;ible under the Tokens of his holy Anger: if they cry not, when he corrects them. He &s;ays to &s;uch, <HI>why &s;hould ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more,</HI> I&s;a. 1. 5. and again, <HI>they are not humbled unto this day,</HI> Jer 44. 10.</P>
<P>BESIDES, We've many Scripture Precepts and Examples, that teach us to Lament, on the occa&s;ion

under con&s;ideration. When GOD threatned <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> by the weeping Prophet, that a People &s;hould come from the North Country, that &s;hould lay hold on Bow and Spear, being <HI>Cruel,</HI> and having <HI>no Mercy:</HI> Jer. 6. 22, 23.

Another In&s;tance we have, Jer. 9 17.&mdash;<HI>Con&s;ider ye, and call for the mourning Women.&mdash;Let them make ha&s;te&mdash;that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eye-lids gu&s;h out with wa|ters&mdash;And teach your Dau'ters wailing and every one her neighbour lamentation.

And then to mention no other Scriptures, our Text and Context is a full and direct proof of our Do|ctrine.

<P><HI>Once more,</HI> WHILE we lament our own and Country's Lo&s;s, we &s;hould not forget to &s;ympathize with the <HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Relatives:</HI> The <HI>Widow</HI> and the <HI>Orphan,</HI> and &s;uch as mourn for an <HI>only Son,</HI> or other

near Relations. They are greatly to be pitied, and their Ca&s;e remembred in our Devotions. We &s;hould pray for them, that GOD would give them Songs in the Night, and &s;ay unto them weep not! That he would comfort tho&s;e that are ca&s;t down, would afford 'em tho&s;e Divine Con&s;olations that are not &s;mall, and refre&s;h their Spirits, in the multitude of their perplexed Tho'ts within them. That he would give them Patience to &s;ubmit to his holy Will, to bear his Indignation, to hold their Peace and be &s;till, knowing that he is GOD, who gives none account of his matters.&mdash;And that he would be a GOD to the <HI>Widow,</HI> a Father to the poor Father|le&s;s <HI>Children:</HI> And better than <HI>Ten Sons</HI> to di&s;con|&s;olate Parents.</P>
<P><HI>Briefly,</HI> WHILE we lament our Ca&s;e is &s;o <HI>&s;ad,</HI> let us be very thankful it is no <HI>wor&s;e,</HI> that it is &s;o well. That we've &s;uch abundant cau&s;e to &s;ing of <HI>Mercy</HI> as well as <HI>Judgment.</HI> For tho' we've lo&s;t &s;ome brave Men, (and have cau&s;e to mourn on that &s;core) yet it's probable the Enemy have lo&s;t more than treble the Number, and among&s;t them &s;ome of their Chiefs, and particularly their bold <HI>Paugus,</HI> and a remarkable Check is given to their In&s;olence, and many Lives may be &s;av'd by this means. While therefore we cry out, <HI>How are the mighty fallen!</HI> Let us admire the Divine Goodne&s;s, that under all their <HI>Hazards, Hard&s;hips</HI> and <HI>Di&s;advantages,</HI> &s;o many are returned. That our Friends can't &s;ay as <HI>Job'</HI>s Me&s;&s;engers, <HI>I only am e&s;caped alone to tell thee:</HI> But that &s;o many are well, and give us the joyful Account that our <HI>little Army</HI> behav'd <HI>bravely,</HI> fought <HI>manful|ly,</HI> and very <HI>&s;ucce&s;sfully;</HI> &s;o that tho' our Lo&s;s is great, yet our Enemies have no cau&s;e to Triumph.

<HI>O let us magnify the Lord, and exalt his Name together,</HI> that the Enemy did not &s;wallow them up quick, that in Wrath GOD has remembred Mercy, and has not dealt with us after our Sins.</P>
