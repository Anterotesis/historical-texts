<HEAD>Introduction.</HEAD>
<P>ONE principal de&s;ign of the pre&s;ent edition of this little book is, to pre&s;erve a Complete Hi&s;tory of a BATTLE or FIGHT, which, though in <HI>it&s;elf</HI> but trif|ling, yet, in its <HI>i&s;&s;ue</HI> or <HI>con&s;equences,</HI> has been ju&s;tly deemed of great importance; it is an intere&s;ting incident in the hi&s;tory of New-england. To attempt a march of upwards of an hundred miles, through a wilderne&s;s, into a fore&s;t, where not a friendly but or civilized inhabitant were to be met with, where Sav|ages and wolves were "lords of the &s;oil!" where "dangers pre&s;t on every &s;ide!" this was a forlorn and de&s;perate adventure, big with danger, re&s;erved for the daring genius of an intrepid <HI>LOVELL.</HI> Who, though he fell in the conte&s;t, by this enterprize, opened a road into a wide extended country, rich in &s;oil, in climate healthy; and pointed the way to the &s;ettlement and civilization of this (at that time de&s;olate and uncultivated, but now) plea&s;ant and populous country.</P>
<P>This enterpri&s;ing adventure of Lovell was begun in April, and his Fight with the Indi|ans, was on the <HI>8</HI>th of May, <HI>1725.</HI> By the be&s;t information which could be obtained from
<PB N="iv" REF="036392_0003_1009E1FFE3A16A08">
Indians who were in the Fight, there were about Eighty of the Savages oppo&s;ed to the brave Lovell with only thirty two men! who killed forty five of the Indians, with their Chief Captain, <HI>Paugus,</HI> and put the re&s;t to flight. Never was a battle &s;u&s;tained with more fortitude and courage, than was this on the part of Captain Lovell and his men; they were engaged the whole day with nearly three times their own number of Savages, and ob|tained a victory over them!</P>
<P>There was not, at the time of this battle, a <HI>white</HI> inhabitant within fifty miles of the &s;cene of action! Saco was the neare&s;t &s;ettle|ment of white people! and the whole of this now civilized country, was then a wide ex|tended wa&s;te, clothed with Nature's rude&s;t wild attire!</P>
<P>In the &s;ummer of <HI>1763,</HI> Mr. Nathaniel Smith moved his family into Fryeburg; this was the fir&s;t family of white people which erected a habitation in the country, vulgarly called <HI>Pigwacket.</HI> On the <HI>20</HI>th Nov. of the &s;ame year, Me&s;&s;rs. Samuel O&s;good, Mo&s;es Ames, John Evans, and Jedediah Spring, moved into Fryeburg, from Concord in New-hamp&s;hire, through a rough, hilly country, un|inhabited
<PB N="v" REF="036392_0004_1009E2035CF7F460">
for <HI>50</HI> or <HI>70</HI> miles; Mr. David Evans and Mr. Nathaniel Merrill, (then young men) accompanied them, as fir&s;t &s;ettlers. The&s;e were they, who encountered the hard|&s;hips, the fatigues, the &s;ufferings, the lo&s;&s;es, of the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of this new country&mdash; The&s;e were they, who lived, like "<HI>a band of brothers,</HI>" in friend&s;hip, who formed the <HI>fir&s;t happy &s;ociety,</HI> on this (till then) <HI>de&s;olate</HI> plain&mdash;who e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves in the bo&s;om of an exten&s;ive wilderne&s;s, and con&s;tituted the <HI>Fir&s;t Civil Family</HI> of a howling fore&s;t. They laid the foundation for a large &s;ettlement, which all of them have had the plea&s;ure to behold increa&s;ing to a populous and wealthy land. To them, and to tho&s;e worthy Matrons who, with heroic courage and fortitude of &s;oul, &s;et hard&s;hip and danger at defi|ance, and rear'd with tender care a race of hardy &s;ons&mdash;to their &s;pirit of enterprize, we are indebted for the enjoyment of this flouri&s;hing country&mdash; May their days roll on in peace, may they ever en|joy ea&s;e, and plenty; and when in a good old age, they &s;hall be called to the land of their fathers, may they depart with the good will and honors of all who participate in the Fruits of their Fir&s;t adven|ture.</P>
<P><HI>The neare&s;t White Neighbors which the&s;e fir&s;t &s;ettlers had for a long time, were at Saco; and with tho&s;e even they had no communication&mdash;
<PB N="vi" REF="036392_0005_1009E205A7B09178">
their neare&s;t place of re&s;ort to obtain tho&s;e ar|ticles of nece&s;&s;ity which they could not forego, was Sanford; nearly &s;ixty miles di&s;tant!</HI></P>
<P><HI>With what plea&s;ure can they look back to the infancy of the country which they fir&s;t planted! and what a &s;atisfaction mu&s;t they enjoy, when they contra&s;t their pre&s;ent &s;cences of ea&s;e and plenty with tho&s;e when the</HI> fatigues of hunting <HI>gave but the &s;canty meal! The recollection of tho&s;e days, mu&s;t give a ze&s;t to the enjoyments of the pre&s;ent, which none can realize but tho&s;e who have &s;een villages grow up, the Arts and Sciences flouri&s;h, where them&s;elves were the fellers of the fore&s;t!</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>1764,</HI> a few more families moved into Frye|burgh, and in <HI>1765</HI> the population began to increa&s;e with con&s;iderable rapidity.</P>
<P>In October <HI>1774,</HI> the people of Fryeburg invited the Rev. <HI>WILLIAM FESSENDEN</HI> to &s;ettle with them; and in October <HI>1775,</HI> he was ordained to the work of the Mini&s;try&mdash;He has continued in a happy Union with his people&mdash;and has &s;een the number of families in Fryeburg increa&s;e from &s;ixty to <HI>one hundred and eight.</HI></P>
<P>In March <HI>1791,</HI> twenty five of the inhabitants of the towns of Fryeburg Conway and Brownfield, a&s;&s;embled for the grand purpo&s;e of e&s;tabli&s;hing a Grammar School&mdash;they agreed upon a mode; opened a &s;ub&s;cription for the purpo&s;e, which was <HI>filled</HI> the very day it was <HI>opened&mdash;[Heaven &s;mil'd upon their plan]</HI>&mdash;a building was erected and completed,
<PB N="vii" REF="036392_0006_1009E20972A339F0">
an In&s;tructor was engaged, and on the <HI>15</HI>th day of November, <HI>1791,</HI> a School commenced with <HI>Fifty</HI> &s;cholars. In February <HI>1792,</HI> it was incorporated with academic privileges, by the Government of this Commonwealth, with the liberal donation of <HI>twelve thou&s;and</HI> acres of land, to which <HI>three thou&s;and</HI> acres more were added in <HI>1793.</HI>&mdash;The funds of this In&s;titution (which are increa&s;ing) are &s;ufficient for the &s;upport of a Preceptor, &amp;c. and will continue &s;o as long as value &s;hall be attached to Land.</P>

<HEAD>The Ancient PREFACE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By the Rev. Mr. SYMMES, of Bradford.</BYLINE>
<P>WHEN Jo&s;hua, with his brave &s;oldi|ers, had di&s;comfited Amalek, with the edge of the &s;word, (while Mo&s;es, with the rod of God in his uplifted hands, &s;up|ported by Aaron and Hur, made inter|ce&s;&s;ion to the God of Armies on the top of the hill) the Lord &s;aid to Mo&s;es, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehear&s;e it in the ears of Jo&s;hua, Exod. xvii. 14. For this would be an un&s;peakable encour|agement to that renowned general, in his wars with the aborigines of Canaan.</P>
<P>Now from this &s;tory we learn, not on|ly that I&s;rael would prevail again&s;t their enemies, they &s;hould all, their magi&s;trates and mini&s;ters e&s;pecially, lift and keep up the hand of prayer;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Agreeable to which made&punc; upon intelligence of great numbers of Indians coming down on the frontiers and the march of &s;eve|ral of our companies in &s;earch of them; at the in&s;tigation of his honor the Lt Gov and the Mini&s;ters of Bo&s;ton, the public lecture there, on the <HI>29</HI>th of April&punc; was turned into a day of Prayer, which was but nine day before the fight at Pigwacket&mdash;the &s;ucce&s;s whereof &s;hould therefore be a&s;cribed with thankfulne&s;s and prai&s;e to God, and gracious an&s;wer of the humble prayers of his people, and improved at their further encouragement.</NOTE> But al&s;o, that the
<PB N="x" REF="036392_0009_1009E2106B735638">
remarkable pre&s;ervation and &s;ucce&s;s of &s;oldiers in fighting the Lord's battles, are very proper to be commemorated, for the honor of God, and the encouragement of his &s;ervants, in future expeditions and military actions.</P>
<P>In con&s;ideration hereof, I have the more ea&s;ily complied with the reque&s;t of &s;ome of the hearers of the en&s;uing &s;ermon, that it might be accompanied with a Narra|tive of the Memorable Occa&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>And though I at fir&s;t propo&s;ed only to reprint the Relation of this Action, given us in the public new&s;papers; yet, having been favored with a more particular ac|count from the valorous Captain Wy|man, and &s;ome others of good credit, that were in the engagement, I hope it will not be unacceptable to any, and am &s;ure it will be very grateful to &s;ome, to have the account publi&s;hed with &s;ome enlarge|ment; and particularly to make a public record of the names of tho&s;e courageous Soldiers, who have &s;o nobly play'd the man for their country; &s;everal of whom have been grievou&s;ly wounded, and others have died in the field of battle, or of the
<PB N="xi" REF="036392_0010_1009E212E7014A60">
wounds they received there&mdash;all of who&s;e names I am per&s;uaded the greate&s;t part of the country will allow, de&s;erve to be tran&s;|mitted unenvied to po&s;terity, with bright encomiums.</P>
<P>It is to be de&s;ired that all who have re|turned from Pigwacket to their own hou&s;|es, will con&s;ider and &s;how what great things God has done for them. And that they and all our brave &s;oldiers, will &s;till take for their Motto, when going forth to War, the in&s;cription made by Mo&s;es on his altar of gratitude, after the defeat of Amalek JEHOVAH-Ni&s;&s;i, The Lord is my Banner.</P>
<P>I have related the &s;tory of the action at Pigwacket, in a &s;tyle adapted to our com|mon way of telling it, and according to the be&s;t information I could obtain; and hope there are no material, I am &s;ure there are no willing or carele&s;s, mi&s;takes in it. And I have only to add:&mdash;That whoever con&s;iders the di&s;tance our people were at from any Engli&s;h &s;ettlement, in a howling wilderne&s;s, and very far in the enemy's country, who were at home, and more than double the number of our men;&mdash;
<PB N="xii" REF="036392_0011_1009E216705BD648">
their fighting from morning till night in a long, hot day&mdash;the number of killed and wounded, among&s;t whom were &s;ome who were per&s;ons of di&s;tinction on both &s;ides; will doubtle&s;s grant that this action mer|its a place in the hi&s;tory of our Neweng|land wars. If any judge I have ob&s;erved &s;ome circum&s;tances of this action too mi|nutely, I have only to &s;ay, if &s;ome &s;uch per&s;ons, or their relations had been in the action, it is po&s;&s;ible they would not have been of this opinion. However, tho&s;e who I am fir&s;tly obliged to gratify, will not ea|&s;ily come into their &s;entiment in this mat|ter. And I mu&s;t beg of the others to for|give me this wrong, and that they would only con&s;ider, the different ta&s;te of readers, and con&s;equently the extreme difficulty, if not impo&s;&s;ibility, of plea&s;ing every body, in a performance of this nature. And yet none would be more willing to do it, than the unworthy author, who is a hearty lover of his country, and of all good men of every denomination.</P>

<HEAD>LOVELL's FIGHT.</HEAD>
<P>IT was about the 16th of April, 1725, that the brave and intrepid Captain JOHN LOVELL began the arduous and perilous undertaking, of marching from Dun&s;table to Pigwacket, with forty &s;ix men under his command.</P>
<P>They had travelled but a &s;hort di&s;tance before TOBY, an Indian, falling &s;ick, was obliged to return, which he did with great reluctance.</P>
<P>When they had marched as far as Con|toocook, Mr. William Cummins, of Dun|&s;table, became &s;o di&s;abled by a wound that he had received from the enemy &s;ome time before, that the Captain di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, together with a kin&s;man of his to accom|pany him back.</P>
<P>They proceeded on to O&s;&s;apy, and at this place Mr. Benjamin Kidder, of Nut|field, falling &s;ick, the Captain made a halt, and tarried while they built a &s;mall forti|fication for a place of refuge to re&s;ort to if there &s;hould be occa&s;ion. Here he left his doctor, a &s;erjeant and &s;even other men, to take care of Kidder. And they left at
<PB N="14" REF="036392_0013_1009E21BD24C3FF8">
this place al&s;o, a con&s;iderable quantity of their provi&s;ions, to lighten the loads of the men and facilitate their march; and which they intended &s;hould &s;erve as a re|cruit on their return.</P>
<P>With his company now reduced to on|ly thirty four men with him&s;elf, Captain Lovell, not at all di&s;heartened by his mis|fortunes, proceeded on his march from his fortification at O&s;&s;apy for Pigwacket, about forty miles di&s;tant from &s;aid fort, through a rough wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>The names of tho&s;e who proceeded on from O&s;&s;apy, and who engaged PAUGUS, with his gang of about eighty Indians, are as follow, (except one who, like a coward, ran from them at the beginning of the engagement, and &s;neaked back to the fort, and who&s;e name is unworthy of being tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity)&mdash;The&s;e are the names of tho&s;e brave fellows, who boldly and &s;ucce&s;sfully contended with more than twice their number, viz.</P>

<P>From the Thur&s;day before the battle, the company were apprehen&s;ive they were di&s;covered and dodged by the enemy; and on Friday night, the watch heard the In|dians about the camp and alarmed the company, but it being very dark, they could make no further di&s;covery.</P>
<P>On Saturday the eighth of May, while they were at prayers, very early in the morning, they heard a gun; and &s;ome lit|tle time after they e&s;pied an Indian on a point, that ran into Saco Pond.</P>
<P>They now concluded that the de&s;ign of the gun, and the Indian's di&s;covering him|&s;elf, was to draw them that way&mdash;They expected now without fail to be attacked, and it was propo&s;ed and con&s;ulted, wheth|er it would be prudent to venture an en|gagement with the enemy, (who they per|ceived were now &s;ufficiently alarmed) or endeavor a &s;peedy retreat. The men generally and boldly an&s;wered, "We came out to &s;ee the enemy; we have all along prayed God we might find them; and we had rather tru&s;t Providence with our lives,
<PB N="17" REF="036392_0016_1009E22824FDFC68">
yea, die for our country, than try to re|turn without &s;eeing them, if we might, and be called cowards for our pains."</P>
<P>The Captain readily complied to lead them on, though not without manife&s;ting &s;ome apprehen&s;ions; and, &s;uppo&s;ing the enemy were ahead of them, (when, as it proved, they were in the rear) ordered the men to lay down their packs, and march with the greate&s;t caution, and in the ut|mo&s;t readine&s;s.</P>
<P>When they had marched about a mile and a half, or two miles, En&s;ign WYMAN e&s;pied an Indian coming towards them, whereupon he gave a &s;ignal, and they all &s;quatted, and let the Indian come on. In a &s;hort time, &s;everal guns were fired at him; upon which the Indian fired upon Captain LOVELL, with beaver-&s;hot, and wounded him mortally, (as is &s;uppo&s;ed) though he made but little complaint, and was &s;till able to travel, and at the &s;ame time wounded Mr. Samuel Whiting &mdash; En&s;ign Wyman immediately fired at and killed, the Indian, and Mr. Frye and ano|ther &s;calped him.</P>
<P>They then marched back towards their
<PB N="18" REF="036392_0017_1009E229A9523B58">
packs, (which the enemy had found in the mean time and &s;eized) and about ten of the clock, when they came pretty near to where they had laid them, at the north ea&s;t end of Saco Pond, on a plain place, where there were few trees and but little bru&s;h, the Indians ro&s;e up in front and rear, in two parties, and ran towards the Engli&s;h&punc; three or four deep, with their guns pre&s;ented: The Engli&s;h al&s;o in&s;tant|ly pre&s;ented their guns, and ru&s;hed on to meet them. When they had advanced to within a few yards of each other, they fired on both &s;ides, and the Indians fell in con&s;iderable numbers, but the Engli&s;h, mo&s;t if not all of them, e&s;caped the fir&s;t &s;hot, and drove the Indians &s;everal rods. Three or four rounds were fired on both &s;ides; but the Indians being more than double in number to our men, and having already killed Captain Lovell, Mr. Ful|lam, (only &s;on of Major Fullam of We&s;|ton) En&s;ign Harwood, John Je&s;ts, Jona|than Kittridge, Daniel Woods, Ichabod John&s;on, Thomas Woods, and Jo&s;iah Da|vis, and wounded Lieutenants Farwell and Robbins and Robert U&s;her, in the

place where the fight begun, and &s;triving to &s;ur|round the re&s;t, the word was given, to retreat to the pond, which was done with a great deal of good conduct, and proved a great &s;ervice to the Engli&s;h, (the pond covering their rear) though the Indians got the ground where the dead of our party lay.</P>
<P>The Fight continued very furious and ob&s;ti|nate, till towards night&mdash;The Indians roaring and yelling and howling like wolves, barking like dogs, and making all &s;orts of hideous noi&s;es &mdash;The Engli&s;h frequently &s;houting and huzza|ing, as they did after the fir&s;t round. At one time, Captain WYMAN is confident, the Indians were diverting them&s;elves in powowing, by their &s;triking upon the ground, and other odd mo|tions&mdash;but Wyman creeping up, and &s;hooting the chief actor, broke up their meeting.</P>
<P>Some of the Indians, holding up ropes, a&s;ked the Engli&s;h if they would take quarter; but were bri&s;kly an&s;wered, that they would have no quarter but at the muzzles of their guns.</P>
<P>About the middle of the afternoon, the inge|nious Mr. Jonathan Frye, (only &s;on of Captain James Frye, of Andover) a young gentleman of a liberal education, who took his degree at col|lege, 1723, and was chaplain to the company, and greatly beloved by them, for his excellent performances &amp; good behavior, and who fought with undaunted courage, till that time of day, was mortally wounded. But when he could
<PB N="20" REF="036392_0019_1009E22CCEB81100">
fight no longer, he prayed audibly &s;everal times for the pre&s;ervation and &s;ucce&s;s of the re&s;idue of the company.</P>
<P>Some time after &s;un&s;et, the enemy drew off and left the field to our men. It was &s;uppo&s;ed and believed, that not more than twenty of the enemy went off well. About midnight, the En|gli&s;h a&s;&s;embled them&s;elves, and upon examining into their &s;ituation, they found Jacob Farrar ju&s;t expiring by the pond, and Lieutenant Rob|bins and Robert U&s;her unable to travel.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Robbins de&s;ired his companions to charge his gun and leave it with him, which they did; he declaring that, As the Indians will come in the morning to &s;calp me, I will kill one more of them if I can.</P>
<P>There were eleven more <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the Engli&s;h, who were badly wounded, viz. Lieutenant Farwell, Mr. Frye, Serjeant John&s;on, Timothy Rich|ard&s;on, Jo&s;iah John&s;on, Samuel Whiting, Elias Barron, John Chamberlain, I&s;aac Lakin, Elea|zer Davis and Jo&s;iah Jones; but they however marched off the ground, with the nine others who received no con&s;iderable wounds, viz. En&s;ign Wyman, Edward Lingfield, Thomas Richard&s;on, the two Melvins, Ebenezer Ayer, Abiel A&s;ten, Jo&s;eph Farrah and Jo&s;eph Gil&s;on. The&s;e all proceeded on their return for the fort, and did not perceive they were way-laid or pur&s;ued by the enemy, though they knew our men had no provi&s;ion, and mu&s;t therefore be very &s;aint.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="036392_0020_1009E23082169778">Four of the wounded men, viz. Farwell, Frye, Davis and Jones, after they had travelled about <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> mile and a half, found them&s;elves unable to go any further, and with their free con&s;ent, the re&s;t kept on their march, hoping to find a recruit at the &s;ort, and to return with fre&s;h hands to relieve them.</P>
<P>As they proceeded on, they divided into three companies one morning, as they were pa&s;&s;ing a thick wood, for fear of making a track by which the enemy might follow them. One of the com|panies came upon three Indians, who pur&s;ued them &s;ome time; meanwhile Elias Barron, one of this party, &s;trayed from the others, and got over O&s;&s;apy river, by the &s;ide of which his gun ca&s;e was found, and he was not heard of after|wards. Eleven, in another party, reached the fort at O&s;&s;apy; but to their great &s;urprize, found it de&s;erted. The coward who fled in the be|ginning of the battle, ran directly to the fort, and gave the men po&s;ted there, &s;uch a frightful ac|count of what had happened, that they all fled from the fort, and made the be&s;t of their way home.</P>
<P>Solomon Kies al&s;o came to the fort. When he had fought in the battle till he received three wound, and had become &s;o weak by the lo&s;s of blood that he could not &s;tand, he crawled up to En&s;ign Wyman, in the heat of the battle, and told him, he was a dead man; but, (&s;aid he) if it be po&s;&s;ible, I will get out of the way of the
<PB N="22" REF="036392_0021_1009E232D6689E38">
Indians, that they may not get my &s;calp. Kies then crept off by the &s;ide of the pond to where he providentially found a canoe, when he rolled him&s;elf into it, and was driven by the wind &s;eve|ral miles toward the fort; he gained &s;trength fa&s;t, and reached the fort as &s;oon as the eleven before mentioned; and they all arrived at Dun|&s;table on the 13th of May, at night.</P>
<P>On the 15th of May, En&s;ign Wyman, and three others, arrived at Dun&s;table. They &s;uf|fered greatly for want of provi&s;ions. They in|formed, that they were wholly de&s;titute of all kinds of food, from a, Saturday morning till the Wedne&s;day following; when they caught two mou&s;e-&s;quirrels, which they roa&s;ted whole, and found to be a &s;weet mor&s;el. They afterwards killed &s;ome patridges and other game, and were comfortably &s;upplied till they got home.</P>
<P>Eleazer Davis arrived at Berwick, and re|ported; that he and the other three who were left with him, waited &s;ome days for the return of the men from the fort, and at length, de&s;pairing of their return, though their wounds were putre|fied and &s;tank, and they were almo&s;t dead with famine, yet they all travelled on &s;everal miles to|gether, till Mr. Frye de&s;ired Davis and Farwell not to hinder them&s;elves any longer on his ac|count, for he found him&s;elf dying, and he laid him&s;elf down, telling them He &s;hould never ri&s;e more, and charged Davis, if it &s;hould plea&s;e God to bring him home, to go to his father, and tell
<PB N="23" REF="036392_0022_1009E235D7B1DF48">
him, that he expected in a few hours to be in eternity, and that he was not afraid to die.&mdash; They left him, and this amiable and promi&s;ing young gentleman, who had the journal of the march in his pocket, was not heard of again.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Farwell, who was greatly and no doubt de&s;ervedly applauded and lamented, was al&s;o left by Davis within a few miles of the fort, and was not afterwards heard of. But Davis, getting to the fort, and finding provi&s;ion there, tarried and refre&s;hed him&s;elf, and recovered &s;trength to travel to Berwick.</P>
<P>Jo&s;iah Jones, another of the four wounded who were left the day after the Fight but a &s;hort di&s;tance from the &s;cene of action, traver&s;ed Saco river, and after a fatiguing ramble, arrived at Saco, (now Biddeford) ematiated, and almo&s;t dead from the lo&s;s of blood, the putrefaction of his wounds and the want of food. He had &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted upon the &s;pontaneous vegetables of the fore&s;t, and cramberries, &amp;c. which he had eaten, came out at a wound he had received in his body. He was kindly treated by the people at Saco, and recovered of his wounds.</P>
<P>Several of the Indians, particularly <HI>Paugus</HI> their Chief, were well known to LOVELL's men, and frequently conver&s;ed with each other during the Engagement. In the cour&s;e of the Battle, <HI>Paugus</HI> and John Chamberlain di&s;cour&s;ed fa|miliarly with each other; their guns had become foul, from frequent firing; they wa&s;hed their
<PB N="24" REF="036392_0023_1009E23927C6CCE0">
guns at the pond, and the latter a&s;&s;ured Paugus that he &s;hould kill him; Paugus al&s;o menaced him, and bid defiance to his in&s;inuations: when they had prepared their guns they loaded and di&s;charged them, and Paugus fell.</P>
<P>A &s;on of Paugus, after it had become a time of peace, went to Dun&s;table, to revenge his fa|ther's death, with the death of Chamberlain&mdash; He did not go directly to Chamberlain's, but to the hou&s;e of a neighbor, where he tarried &s;everal days, upon &s;ome pretended bu&s;ine&s;s, that his de|&s;ign might not be di&s;covered; his errand was however &s;u&s;pected, and a hint given to Cham|berlain&mdash;who cut a port-hole above his door, through which he very early one morning di&s;|covered an Indian behind his wood pile, lying with his gun pointing directly to the door; and it was &s;uppo&s;ed that the &s;ame mu&s;ket which had conveyed the mean of death to the bo&s;om of the great Paugus, al&s;o proved fatal to his &s;on, as he was not afterwards heard of</P>
<P>It is al&s;o reported of this Chamberlain, (who was a &s;tout and a courageous man, and who u&s;ed to &s;ay that he was not to be killed by an Indian) that he was once fired at by an Indian, as he was at work in a &s;aw mill, at night; he was in a &s;toop|ing po&s;ition, and did not di&s;cover the Indian till he fired, who was &s;o near him that he immedi|ately knocked him down with a crowbar, with which he was &s;etting his log.</P>
<P>After the return of the Engli&s;h from their

fight, Col. TYNG, with a company, went to the place of action, where he found and buried the following men, viz. Captain John Lovell, En|&s;ign Jonathan Woods, En&s;ign John Harwood, &amp; Robert U&s;her, of Dun&s;table; Jacob Fullam, of We&s;ton; Jacob Farrar, and Jo&s;iah Davis, of Concord; Thomas Woods, Daniel Woods, and John Jefts, of Groton; Ichabod John&s;on, of Woburn; Jonathan Kittridge, of Billerica.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Jo&s;iah Farwell, of Dun&s;table, Mr. Chaplain Frye, of Andover, and Elias Barron, of Groton, were wounded, and died by the way in attempting to return home.</P>
<P>Col. Tyng found where the Indians had bur|ied three of their men, which were dug up, and one of them was known to be the bold Paugus, who had been a great &s;courge to Dun&s;table.</P>
<P>En&s;ign Wyman was rewarded with a Cap|tain's Commi&s;&s;ion after his return; and every man was crowned with the grateful thanks of their countrymen, for this heavy blow given to a plundering &s;avage foe, the common enemy of their country.</P>

<P>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war peri&s;hed!</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE book before us is entitled the &s;econd of Samuel, not that it was written by the fa|mous prophet of that name; for it contains a hi&s;tory of what came to pa&s;s after his death; of which we have an account in the 25th chapt. of the former book; but the latter part of the for|mer, with the whole of this book, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be written by Nathan or Gad, or by Heze|kiah or Ezra. And probably it is called the Second of Samuel, by the Hebrews, becau&s;e it is a continuation of the hi&s;tory began by him; and &s;o, being a &s;upplement to the hi&s;tory of Sam|uel, it goes under his name; as is u&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;es now a days.</P>
<P>In the chapter before us, we have a very cel|ebrated elegy; of which our text is the conclu|&s;ion. And here we may ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, Who was the author of this elegy, or fu|neral poem namely, David; agreeably it is in our p&s;almbook termed David's Elegy. The Sweet P&s;almi&s;t of I&s;rael was a Poet, as well as mu&s;ician; and has given us a noble &s;pecimen of his admirable poetic genius, in the mournful po|em before us. But we are to con&s;ider him here not only as a fini&s;hed poet, but as an eminent &s;ervant of God, even the man after God's own
<PB N="27" REF="036392_0026_1009E23F17E3DC28">
heart; who duly con&s;idering the works of the Lord, and regarding the operations of his hands, has &s;et us a very bright example, how to behave upon, and what improvement to make of, the death of u&s;eful men; e&s;pecially of &s;uch as not only have jeoparded their lives unto death, but nobly laid down their lives in the high places of the field, in the &s;ervice of their king and country &mdash;David lamented with this lamentation.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, Ob&s;erve the &s;ubject and occa&s;ion of this elegy, viz. the death of Saul and Jonathan, who with many of their army fell down &s;lain on Mount Gilboa, 1 Sam. 31.1, 2, 3. Tidings of this &s;laughter being brought unto David, he was greatly affected therewith, and (as was cu&s;toma|ry among&s;t the Hebrews on &s;uch &s;orrowful occa|&s;ions) David took hold on his clothes and rent them, and likewi&s;e all the men that were with him. And they mourned and wept and fa&s;ted until even, for Saul and for Jonathan his &s;on, and for the people of the Lord, and for the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, becau&s;e they were fallen by the &s;word. Context 11 and 12 ver. And having done ju&s;|tice on the young Amalekite that brought the news, who by his own confe&s;&s;ion had &s;tretched forth his hand to &s;lay the Lord's anointed, he further gave vent to his grief, in the elegant compo&s;ition before us.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, Ob&s;erve the matter and &s;ub&s;tance of this elegy: or, what David &s;aid on this great oc|ca&s;ion. And fir&s;t he utters this mournful a&s;|&s;ertion,
<PB N="28" REF="036392_0027_1009E241CE0F8878">
The Beauty of I&s;rael is &s;lain upon thy high places! ver. 19. Expert &s;oldiers are no incon&s;iderable part of the beauty of I&s;rael. Then follows a very pathetical exclamation, which is thrice repeated, v. 19, 25, 27, and is the burthen of the &s;ong, How are the mighty fallen! We have then his wi&s;h, with the rea&s;on of it, that the tragical news might not be publi&s;hed, v. 20. Tell it not in Gath, publi&s;h it not in the &s;treets of A&s;kelon: le&s;t the daughters of the Phili&s;tines rejoice, le&s;t the daughters of the uncircumci&s;ed triumph. The Imperative mood is u&s;ed in the beginning of the ver&s;e for the Optative, after the manner of pa&s;&s;ionate mourners, who often wi&s;h for things impo&s;&s;ible. And by this form of &s;peech David rather expre&s;&s;es his dete&s;tation of what was done, than &s;orbids the doing of it: q. d. O that this doleful &s;tory had never been told in Gath! for &s;o it &s;urely was, 1 Sam. 31.8, 9, 10. We have next David's imprecation, on the place of the defeat, with the rea&s;on of it, v. 21. Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, nei|ther let there be rain upon you, nor fields of of|ferings; for there the &s;hield of the mighty is vilely &s;lung away. Some think this only a fig|urative &s;peech, &s;uppo&s;ing the very heavens and earth had a kind of &s;en&s;e and feeling of this ca|lamity; others think it a prophetical cur&s;e, that took effect accordingly, even as our Saviour's, denounced on the barren fig tree. But this has been confuted by Brochard and others, who have
<PB N="29" REF="036392_0028_1009E24627AFFD08">
been upon the place. We may therefore look upon it, as only an hyperbolical imprecation.</P>
<P>David then goes on to commend Saul and Jo|nathan, for their wonderful &s;ucce&s;s at arms v. 22. From the blood of the &s;lain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the &s;word of Saul returned not empty.&mdash; They were won to be victorious over their &s;tout|e&s;t enemies. And that it is otherwi&s;e now, and that the&s;e valiant men are fallen, argues that God is angry; which &s;hould awaken his people to re|pentance. He further celebrates (as, their af|fection to one another and union in death, v. 23. &s;o,) their agility and courage. They were &s;wifter than eagles, they were bolder than lions. They were &s;wift and nimble to pur&s;ue their ene|mies, and to avoid danger; and &s;trong and val|iant to re&s;i&s;t and overcome &s;uch as dared to op|po&s;e them. Briefly, he commends Saul for his royal bounty to the daughters of I&s;rael, whom he calls upon to lament him, v. 24. Even the daughters of I&s;rael had been wont to bear their part in Saul's triumphs, and now it became them to mourn his fall. As all &s;hare in common ca|lamities, &s;o all &s;hould be &s;uitably affected there|with. Finally, David particularly laments over Jonathan, profe&s;&s;ing his deep di&s;tre&s;s for him, the dear affection between them, and the plea&s;ure he took in his conver&s;ation, v. 25, 26</P>
<P N="4">4th, Ob&s;erve &s;ome of the properties of this elegy. And fir&s;t, it is extremely elegant, the
<PB N="30" REF="036392_0029_1009E247AC69F308">
ideas are very bright, and well adapted; the phra&s;es are very expre&s;&s;ive and emphatical, and hence the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> very moving and pa|thetical. And particularly, where he &s;peaks of his friend Jonathan, nothing can be more &s;oft and tender, and expre&s;&s;ed with a greater pathos. And what more pa&s;&s;ionate than his repeated ex|clamation, How are the mighty fallen! Tho&s;e valiant and renowned commanders, Saul and Jonathan, with their brave and undaunted &s;ol|diers, that fell with them. So that the Weapons of War are peri&s;hed, i. e. tho&s;e who wielded them are dead. And what will weapons do, without men of &s;kill and courage to handle them, for their country's pre&s;ervation and defence, and the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion and extirpation of their en|emies?</P>
<P>Again. The whole Poem is &s;ufficiently brave and manly. David &s;hows him&s;elf a man of a great &s;oul, now that Saul's day was come to die, and God had delivered him out of his hands; and Saul could now no longer per&s;ecute and hunt him as a partridge on the mountains, as he had a long while done; (for as in the grave the weary &s;ervants of God are at re&s;t, &s;o, ble&s;&s;ed be God, when the wicked are lodged there, they cea&s;e from troubling) I &s;ay, though David was now delivered, he &s;corns to trample with in&s;ult|ing feet on the monument of the dead, and boa&s;t over a breathle&s;s corp&s;e; but buries all the faults
<PB N="31" REF="036392_0030_1009E24AAD2D6248">
of Saul in perpetual oblivion, in the land of for|getfulne&s;s, lays a&s;ide all &s;pleen, and heartily mourns his country's reproach and lo&s;s, though the very means of his own deliverance and ad|vancement, (a noble in&s;tance of public &s;pirited|ne&s;s) and commemorates what was commenda|ble, even in Saul. For, <HI>de mortuis, nil ni&s;i bo|num.</HI> None that are men after God's own heart, will unnece&s;&s;arily rip up the faults of others; and &s;peak evil of tho&s;e that cannot &s;peak for them&s;elves. Tho&s;e that are not thus tender of the reputation of others, may ju&s;tly fear that others will be as free with them, when they are &s;ilent in the grave.</P>
<P>But then it is al&s;o a martial poem: it is writ|ten with a martial air. The &s;ubject is entirely military. He laments his heroes, con&s;idered in their military character. He celebrates their military accompli&s;hments and atchievements. And he dedicates it to the militia of Judah, as in the parenthe&s;is in the preface, 18th v <HI>al&s;o he bade them teach the children of Judah the u&s;e of the bow.</HI> Whence it is evident, That David in the mid&s;t of his mourning, is not unmindful of what was nece&s;&s;ary for the good of the commonwealth: Teaching us, not to be &s;o overcome with grief, on &s;uch &s;orrowful occa&s;ions, as to forget our du|ty, and neglect means for our own or our coun|try's &s;afety.</P>
<P>Furthermore, This Elegy is very ancient. It
<PB N="32" REF="036392_0031_1009E24D6193EE98">
was written about eight and twenty hundred years ago. And according to &s;ome chronologies, be|fore the famous Iliads of Homer, who was the very father of all the Heathen Poets, and &s;aid to be born in the reign of Solomon the &s;on of Da|vid. It is then one of the fir&s;t born of elegies, and venerable for its antiquity. It is &s;aid to be recorded in the book of Ja&s;he<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, i. e. the Ju&s;t or Upright. We read of it Jo&s;h. 10 13. It is &s;up|po&s;ed this book was continued from <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to age, as a collection of State Poems, (&s;ay &s;ome) or of the memorable acts of God's worthies; and tho' laid up at length in the temple (as Jo&s;ephus re|ports) yet being not canonical, is now lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Finally, To remark no more characters of this poem, it is a &s;cripture elegy: for though we do not &s;uppo&s;e it at fir&s;t written by in&s;piration; yet being agreeable to the will of God, was adopted (if I may &s;o expre&s;s it) by the Holy Spirit, who in&s;pired tho&s;e that in&s;erted it in the &s;acred pages, &s;o that it is now a part of Canonical Scripture, And thus it is probable the penman of the chron|icles collected many things out of the book of Ja&s;her, being guided therein by the unerring &s;pirit of God. And though the name of God is not to be found in this elegy, yet it is con&s;onant to religion, and approved by God; and hence we learn, that what is &s;poken or written by the &s;ervants of God, may be very agreeable to the will of God, and for his glory, though the name
<PB N="33" REF="036392_0032_1009E2501323DF30">
of God or Chri&s;t is not to be found therein &mdash; Thus the book of E&s;ther wherein are no le&s;s than ten chapters, has not the name of God in it.</P>
<P N="5">5th, Ob&s;erve the main &s;cope and de&s;ign of this elegy. And there are two things more e&s;|pecially that David had in view, after the glory of God, his ultimate end. Fir&s;t, To perpetuate the memory of Saul, and his dearly beloved Jo|nathan, his bo&s;om friend. "Great indeed was the love between Damon and Pythias; for when Diony&s;ius the tyrant, had on &s;ome occa&s;ion &s;ig|nified his re&s;olution that one of them &s;hould die, and permitted Damon to go home and &s;ettle his affairs before his death, provided he could find one to be &s;urety for his return; Pythias forth|with offered voluntarily, and put him&s;elf in the tyrant's power. Damon coming back preci&s;ely at the time appointed, Diony&s;ius did &s;o much admire their mutual fidelity, that he pardoned both, and prayed that he might be admitted the third into their friend&s;hip." But the love of David and Jonathan was more divine and excel|lent, than that of the&s;e brave heathen philo&s;o|phers. We have the account of its commence|ment, 1 Sam. 18. begin. And it came to pa&s;s when he [David] had made an end of &s;peaking to Saul, that the &s;oul of Jonathan was knit with the &s;oul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own &s;oul. And Saul took him that day and would let him go no more home to his father's
<PB N="34" REF="036392_0033_1009E25360C8AB70">
hou&s;e. Then Jonathan and David made a cov|enant, becau&s;e he loved him as his own &s;oul. And Jonathan &s;tript him&s;elf of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his gar|ments, even to his &s;word and his bow, and to his girdle. For &s;uch a friend, one would even dare to die. To be &s;ure, David would have the mem|ory of this ju&s;t man ble&s;&s;ed. He would have him had in everla&s;ting remembrance. And be here does his part, that it might be &s;o, and the event was agreeable to his pious de&s;ire, for wherever the Bible is enjoyed, this elegy is &s;till to be found on record for a memorial of him.</P>
<P>But then David had a further reach than bare|ly to embalm the name of his friend, and per|petuate the remembrance of Saul, for his rela|tion to Jonathan and to his country; For, by this elegy, or funeral &s;ong, David de&s;igned to fire the ambition of his contemporaries and &s;ucce&s;|&s;ors, to &s;eek to excel in chivalry; and to fire them al&s;o with zeal to pro&s;ecute the war again&s;t the barbarous Phili&s;tines, and to avenge the death of their &s;overeign, and &s;everal of the royal family, and many other gallant &s;oldiers; and to defend them&s;elves, again&s;t their in&s;ults and de|predations.

<P>Having, ob&s;erved the&s;e things in General in this elegy, I come now to remark from the con|clu&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>That the fall of brave and &s;ucce&s;sful warriors in the field of battle, is very much to be lament|ed by the people of God, in who&s;e immediate &s;ervice they lo&s;t their lives. We &s;hould lament over them with this lamentation, How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war peri&s;hed! Fir&s;t, It is &s;ometimes the lot of the brave&s;t war|riors, and of &s;uch as have been very &s;ucce&s;sful, to fall at la&s;t, or be &s;lain in the field of battle. Saul had been a brave warrior, and did worthily in the beginning of his reign. The hi&s;tory of his deliverance of Jabe&s;h Gilead when Na<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;h the Ammonite came up and encamped again&s;t it, is very noble and brave, 1 Sam. 11. begin. He di&s;covered both great courage and conduct, in that whole action: at the 11th. we read, Saul
<PB N="36" REF="036392_0035_1009E2591A6D78F0">
put the people in three companies, and they came into the mid&s;t of the ho&s;t in the morning watch, and &s;lew the Ammonites, until the heat of the day; and it came to pa&s;s that they which remain|ed were &s;cattered, &s;o that two of them were not left together. Thus he effectually ra&s;ed the &s;iege of poor Jabe&s;h-Gilead, and delivered the city. And when &s;ome hot-headed people pro|po&s;ed to Samuel that the malecontents &s;hould be put to death, who had &s;aid, Shall Saul reign over us? Saul very generou&s;ly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the motion, and &s;nubbed tho&s;e that too officiou&s;ly propo&s;ed it; &s;aying. There &s;hall not a man be put to death this day! And as he was once re|turning from the &s;laughter of the Phili&s;tines the women came out of all the cities of I&s;rael, &s;ing+ing and dancing, to meet King Saul with tabrets, with joy and with in&s;truments of mu&s;ic; and the women an&s;wered one to another as they played, and &s;aid, Saul hath &s;lain his thou&s;ands. We read al&s;o of Jonathan, that he &s;mote the garri&s;on of the Phili&s;tines that was in Geba, 1 Sam. 13.3. And in the beginning of the 14th chapter we are informed how Jonathan and his armourbear|er, did miraculou&s;ly &s;mite the Phili&s;tines. And in the context, ver. 22. David gives them this encomium, From the blood of the &s;lain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Janathan turn|ed not back, and the &s;word of Saul returned not empty. And he calls them, the mighty, and the
<PB N="37" REF="036392_0036_1009E25B6DC291B0">
flower or beauty of I&s;rael. Now the&s;e brave, &s;ucce&s;sful &s;oldiers were &s;lain in bat|tle at la&s;t, upon mount Gilboa.</P>
<P>And, not to mention any other in&s;tance, thus "Gu&s;tavus Adolphus, &s;tiled the great King of Sweden, who took for his motto, If God be for us, who can be again&s;t us? And who was an incomparable warrior, venturous &s;ometimes even without nece&s;|&s;ity; and e&s;pecially in war, would neglect his life and perform rather the duty of a &s;oldier than of a general; and to excu&s;e him&s;elf would &s;ay, The armies &s;light the danger they &s;hare in with their king; and that if Generals do not act in per&s;on, they can never atchieve a glittering reputation; and that &s;uch as &s;hun death, meet it oftner than they that &s;eek it; that Julius Ce&s;ar was never wounded in battle, though he ever fought in the foremo&s;t ranks of his troops; and that Alexander the Great marked out the way with his own blood, that led him to the empire of the Ea&s;t; and that to be as famous as the&s;e great men, he ought to be no more timorous than they: this great man, after he had obtained divers victories over the Danes

and Poles and Mu&s;covites, and received thirteen wounds before tho&s;e of which he died, was at length &s;lain in a battle with the Germans, having fir&s;t almo&s;t got the victory, which his army completed after his death. And thus the Great Gu&s;tavus died, in the 38th year of his age, 1632, whil&s;t victory (as one expre&s;&s;es it) lay bleeding by his &s;ide.</P>
<P>Secondly, The fall of brave and &s;ucce&s;s|ful &s;oldiers is very much to be lamented by the people of God. There is a time to weep, as well as a time to laugh. And every thing is beautiful in its &s;ea&s;on. Now when brave and &s;ucce&s;sful &s;oldiers are &s;lain in the field of battle, who have been im|proved by Providence as In&s;truments of checking the pride and in&s;olence, and wea|kening the force, and thinning the num|ber, and di&s;couraging the hearts of the enemies of God's people, and of pre&s;erv|ing the lives, liberties and properties of the I&s;rael of God; and might if God had &s;par|ed them been a further &s;courge to the en|emy, and defence to the people of God, by contending with the enemy in battle; it is very proper and highly rea&s;onable &s;uch
<PB N="39" REF="036392_0038_1009E26229255728">
e&s;pecially in who&s;e immediate &s;ervice they have courageou&s;ly ventured, and undaunt|edly laid down their lives &s;hould lament their death. And the contrary is, how in|decent? how &s;otti&s;h? how &s;tupid and un|rea&s;onable? Now what&s;oever things are lovely, decorous and of good report, chri&s;|tians &s;hould love and practi&s;e the&s;e things, Phil. 4.8. The civilized heathen will ri&s;e up in judgment again&s;t Chri&s;tians; yea, and the barbarians al&s;o, if they do not do &s;uch de&s;erving per&s;ons the honor of la|menting their untimely death. It is hu|mane and manly to do &s;o: but the contra|ry is, indeed, inhumane, and wor&s;e than heatheni&s;h.</P>
<P>Secondly, It is ju&s;t and equal, for the people of God to lament the death of brave and &s;ucce&s;sful &s;oldiers &s;lain by their ene|mies, and in their &s;ervice. Tears and prop|er lamentations are a debt we owe them. They have dearly merited this piece of re|&s;pect from their people. It is but ju&s;t, to &s;hed tears for them, that have &s;hed their hearts blood for us. And &s;urely, if they de&s;erved the applau&s;e and commendation of all while they lived; they ought to be
<PB N="40" REF="036392_0039_1009E263DB9BA850">
honored with the lamentations of all when they are &s;lain in the high places of the field. And the law of equity calls for it. Surely it is to do as we would be done by; or as we &s;hould de&s;ire any of our dear relatives &s;hould be treated, in like circum|&s;tances. If it had been the lot of any very nearly related to us (and it has been &s;o) to be &s;lain in battle, or &s;ea-fight, play|ing the man for their GOD; &s;urely a due notice taken of their death, by the people of God, would be what we &s;hould expect and be plea&s;ed with. Now what&s;oever we would that men &s;hould do to us, we &s;hould do the &s;ame to them; or, we tran&s;|gre&s;s a golden rule. But if this rule be out of fa&s;hion with any; yet</P>
<P>Thirdly, Agreeable lamentations for ex|pert and &s;ucce&s;sful &s;oldiers &s;lain in war, are very u&s;eful and advantageous. It is a comfort to their bereaved relatives, when they ob&s;erve that the people of God do greatly bewail the death of their friends, and heartily &s;ympathize with them, though their lo&s;s may po&s;&s;ibly be in &s;ome re&s;pects irreparable; yet this &s;hould and will con|tribute not a little, to alleviate their &s;or|row,
<PB N="41" REF="036392_0040_1009E26813C1D0C8">
ea&s;e their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed minds, and dry up their tears.</P>
<P>And then, it is a &s;pur to Virtue. When &s;urviving &s;oldiers (and particularly &s;uch as have been eye-witne&s;&s;es of the fall of their brethren, and &s;ought with uncommon bravery, and were either wounded, or e|qually expo&s;ed in the &s;ame battle, with tho&s;e that are &s;lain) take notice that the death of their officers or fellow &s;oldiers is deeply re&s;ented by the people of God, that they &s;till &s;peak of them with great honor in their lamentations; this will animate them, we hope, to do worthily, and rather die with honor, if called to battle, than live with di&s;grace; &amp; for their cowardice, have the offer of a wooden &s;word, and be branded with the infamous character of cowards, even by the weaker &s;ex.</P>
<P>Whereas, on the other hand, it is a great aggravation of the affliction of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed mourners, when they ob&s;erve that the gen|erality only give the news of their friends death the hearing, but &s;eem as &s;toical and unconcerned about it, as if their lives were of no value.&mdash;Such inhu|manity is very exerci&s;ing to ingenuous
<PB N="42" REF="036392_0041_1009E2699777C448">
minds and &s;uch as have any &s;en&s;e of hon|or. Be&s;ides &s;uch a &s;ordid in&s;en&s;iblene&s;s is very di&s;couraging to our brave &s;oldiers. Who could be willing to venture their lives for &s;uch ungrateful people!</P>
<P>Finally, It is pious and &s;criptural to be|wail the death of &s;uch brave and &s;ucce&s;s|ful &s;oldiers, who&s;e lot it is to be &s;lain at la&s;t in the field of battle, God expects we &s;hould lay to heart the death of all our fel|low creatures: that is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to his heart, Eccl. 7.2. And particularly, we are obliged to lament the death of eminently u&s;eful men, though they die quietly in their beds, and come to their graves in a good old age, like as a &s;hock of corn comes in, in it's &s;ea|&s;on. How much more &s;hould we mourn their lo&s;s, when &s;lain in battle, in the mid&s;t of their days, or in the very flower of their age, while their brea&s;ts were full of milk, and their bones were moi&s;tened with marrow. It is a &s;ore judgment when God &s;uffers &s;uch to fall by, and into the hand of the enemy, and does not cover their heads in the day of battle. This is an awful frown, and argues the great di&s;|plea&s;ure
<PB N="43" REF="036392_0042_1009E26C2B667170">
of God. Hence he threatened the men of Anathoth, that &s;aid to the prophet Jeremy, prophe&s;y not in the name of the Lord, that their young men &s;hould die by the &s;word, Jer. 11.21, 22. and alike threat|ning he denounced again&s;t Moab, Jer. 48 15.&mdash;His cho&s;en young men are gone down to the &s;lau'ter, &s;aith the King, who&s;e name is the Lord of Ho&s;ts. And when the wrath of the Lord was ri&s;en again&s;t I&s;rael, for their mea&s;ure-filling &s;in, in mocking the Lord's me&s;&s;engers, de&s;pi&s;ing his words and mi&s;u&s;ing his Prophets, it is &s;aid, 2 Chron. 36.17. Therefore he brought up|on them, the King of the Chaldees, who &s;lew their young men with the &s;word. Now what greater cau&s;e of mourning and lamentation than the manife&s;tations of God's di&s;plea&s;ure? If the Lion roar, who will not tremble? but alas, who can &s;tand when God is angry! and he highly re&s;ents it, when his people are in&s;en&s;ible under the tokens of his holy anger: if they cry not, when he corrects them. He &s;ays to &s;uch, why &s;hould ye be &s;tricken any more? ye will revolt more and more, I&s;a. 1.5. and
<PB N="44" REF="036392_0043_1009E26DC9F5CA18">
again, they are not humbled unto this day, Jer. 44.10.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, we have many &s;cripture pre|cepts and examples that teach us to la|ment on the occa&s;ion under con&s;ideration. When God threatened I&s;rael, by the weep|ing prophet, that a people &s;hould come from the North Country, that &s;hould lay hold on bow and &s;pear, being cruel, and having no mercy: Jer. 6.22, 23. It is added, ver. 26. O Daughter of my peo|ple, gird thee with &s;ackcloth, and wal|low thy&s;elf in a&s;hes: make thee mourn|ing as for an Only Son, mo&s;t bitter lamen|tation;&mdash;Surely then, there &s;hould be a proportionable lamentation, when &s;everal cho&s;en young men, and &s;ome very promi|&s;ing and hopeful, are actually flain by men of the Chaldean Character. Another in|&s;tance we have, Jer. 9.17.&mdash;Con&s;ider ye, and call for the mourning women.&mdash;Let them make ha&s;te&mdash;that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eye-lids gu&s;h out with waters&mdash;and teach your daugh|ters wailing and every one her neighbour lamentation. For death is come up,&mdash;to cut off the young men from the &s;treets.
<PB N="45" REF="036392_0044_1009E272544D1908">
And even the carca&s;es of men &s;hall fall as dung upon the open field&mdash;and none &s;hall gather, or, bury them. This evinces, that God calls to mourning when young men fall by the &s;word, and the mighty in the battle. And then to mention no other Scriptures, our text and context is a full and direct proof of our doctrine. For, as was ob&s;erved before, this mournful &s;ong was David's lamentation over tho&s;e that were &s;lain by the Phili&s;tines on mount Gil|boa.</P>
<P>But I proceed to the Application. And,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, If it is &s;ometimes the lot of the mo&s;t valiant and &s;ucce&s;sful &s;oldiers, to be &s;lain at la&s;t in battle; then they that gird on the harne&s;s &s;hould not boa&s;t as they that put it off. This was well ob&s;erved by Ahab to Benhadad King of Syria, 1. Kings 20.11. All &s;uch prepo&s;terous boa&s;ting is evil; very fooli&s;h and ominous, and commonly followed with fatal con&s;equents. Boa&s;ting Benhadad had cau&s;e and lei&s;ure in his inner chamber to think of this ar|my mi&s;erably broken a fir&s;t time, and &s;lain with a great &s;laughter, by a company of &s;triplings, under the command of Ahab
<PB N="46" REF="036392_0045_1009E274B0734260">
their King: and a &s;econd time totally rout|ed; an hundred thou&s;and footmen being &s;lain in one day by the I&s;raelites; and twenty &s;even thou&s;and more by the falling of a wall upon them; and he reduced to &s;uch abject circum&s;tances, as to beg quar|ter by his amba&s;&s;adors with &s;ackcloth on their loins and ropes on their heads. How was the &s;cene now changed, and his tune turned, 1. Kings 20. And thus we find the &s;waggering Goliah, who defied the armies of the living God, one minute cur&s;|ing David by his Gods, and di&s;dainfully &s;aying, <HI>Come to me and I will give thy fle&s;h to the fowls of the air, and to the bea&s;ts of the field</HI>; and the next minute tumbling head|long with his face upon the earth: and the beauty of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> cutting off his Head with his own &s;word, 1 Sam. 17.1,&mdash;51.</P>
<P>God allows us indeed, in our &s;piritual warfare, (and in extraordinary ca&s;es, as, in David's, an&s;wering the challenge of the Giant, in a carnal warfare al&s;o) to triumph before the battle and to &s;ay, thanks be un|to God, that giveth us the Victory, through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. For in all the&s;e things we are more than conquerors thro'
<PB N="47" REF="036392_0046_1009E2768B2B8328">
the Captain of our Salvation, who&s;e is the Victory, and who hath loved us, and will give it to us!</P>
<P>But without particular Revelation, not now to be expected, none can tell, wheth|er the many, or the few; the &s;trong or the weak; the righteous or the wicked; the friend or enemy will get the day in the field of battle. Boa&s;ting then, upon the going forth of armies, is to be condemned; both in &s;uch as go forth to war, and in &s;uch as tarry at home, on their account.</P>
<P>Secondly, The mo&s;t &s;kilful, dexterous, courageous and &s;ucce&s;sful &s;oldiers, had need to be truly religious and well pre|pared for death; &s;eeing they are not invul|nerable, but as liable to die as others. An Indian bullet will kill a hero, a champion, as ea&s;ily as a faint hearted coward: a Cap|tain, or Chaplain, as &s;oon as a bringer up of the front half files; or the mo&s;t inferi|or private &s;oldier. There mu&s;t indeed be the &s;wiftne&s;s of the eagle, the &s;ubtilty of the fox, the &s;trength and boldne&s;s of the lion, as well as the grace of the chri&s;tian, to con&s;titute a brave &s;oldier; and every devout chri&s;tian, that is fit for heaven, is
<PB N="48" REF="036392_0047_1009E2791195C908">
not mo&s;t fit to go forth to war. But, though &s;uch as are de&s;titute of grace may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;tout &s;oldiers and noble commanders, and de|&s;erve well of their prince and country; and in an&s;wer to the prayers of God's people, in who&s;e cau&s;e they are employed, they might fight val|iantly, and play the man for their people, and tread down the enemy; yet if they are &s;lain, they cannot groundedly expect &s;alvation. Seeing then our &s;oldiers carry their lives in their hands, when they go forth to war, and are &s;till liable to be ambu&s;hed, wherever they travel in the va&s;t howling wilderne&s;s, and, killed unexpectedly, as well as &s;lain in a pitched battle, they had need be always ready not only to fight, but to die, and make their appearance before God. And in or|der thereto, they &s;hould now believe in Chri&s;t, and repent of all their &s;ins, and &s;o get into, and keep in good terms with God, who can ea&s;ily pre&s;erve them, though a thou&s;and fall at their &s;ide, and ten thou&s;and at their right hand; and can cau&s;e one of them to cha&s;e a thou&s;and, and two of them to put ten thou&s;and to flight.</P>
<P>The wretched Je&s;uites or friars, are wont (it is &s;aid) to ab&s;olve their deluded Pro&s;elytes, the bar|barous Indians, when they come forth to war again&s;t us: and flatter them with the promi&s;e of an immediate pa&s;&s;age to Paradi&s;e, without any &s;top at purgatory, if they fall in battle: and the&s;e delu&s;ive hopes may po&s;&s;ibly animate them, to
<PB N="49" REF="036392_0048_1009E27BA519D938">
fight with great fury in their engagements with us. And many private &s;oldiers and inferior Of|ficers in the campaigns in Chri&s;tendom, meerly from the pro&s;pect of applau&s;e, promotion, or fil|thy lucre; or for thir&s;t after revenge, and a vain opinion that fighting in a good cau&s;e, and on the right &s;ide they &s;hall &s;urely be happy in the next world, if they are killed in battle, have po&s;&s;ibly been led on to fight with undaunted re&s;olution, and the utmo&s;t intrepidity. Surely then the mo|tives of pure Religion, &s;uch as &s;erving God and their Country; having God to go before them, and fight for them, and either to cover their heads, or, receive their departing &s;ouls to the ble&s;&s;ed man&s;ions above, where there is no adver&s;ary nor evil occurrent, where they &s;hall re&s;t from their labours, and their works &s;hall follow them, mu&s;t needs be &s;ufficient, by the influence of the holy Spirit that dwelleth in all real Chri&s;tians, to cau&s;e to wax valiant in fight, and to rai&s;e them above the fear of what Earth or Hell can do unto them.</P>
<P>So then, a well grounded per&s;ua&s;ion of a part in Chri&s;t, and an Intere&s;t in the favour of God, is what all that go forth to war, would do wi&s;ely to give all diligence to obtain.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Since the be&s;t of &s;oldiers are liable to be overcome and &s;lain in war, it ill becomes the people of God to put their tru&s;t in man. Tho' it is their duty and wi&s;dom to employ and encour|age expert &s;oldiers; yet it is their &s;in and folly
<PB N="48" REF="036392_0049_1009E27E45D28638">
to tru&s;t in them. As it is idolatry for &s;oldiers to tru&s;t in their arms, or in their dexterity and cour|age to handle them; or in one another; &s;o it is idolatry for the people of God, in who&s;e &s;ervice they go forth, to tru&s;t in them. For, alas! what is man, who&s;e breath is it his no&s;trils, and wherein is he to be accounted of? His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his du&s;t; in that ve|ry day, all his projections and re&s;olutions, and accompli&s;hments for war, peri&s;h.</P>
<P>Surely then, it is the greate&s;t folly for a people to tru&s;t in their forces, how well &s;oever qualifi|ed, &s;pirited and equipped, and how &s;ucce&s;sful &s;oever they have been. For, every creature is that to us that God makes it to be; and unle&s;s God give help, vain is the help of man, Jer. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> 23. Truly in vain is &s;alvation hoped for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the hills, and from the multitude of mountains; truly in the Lord our God is the &s;alvation of I&s;|rael.

Agreeably we find the People of God, re&s;olving, in the name of our God we will &s;et up our banners. And whil&s;t &s;ome tru&s;t in Chariots and &s;ome in hor&s;es, we will remember the name of the Lord our God, P&s;al. 20 5, &mdash;7. And a|gain, through thee we will pu&s;h down our Ene|mies: through thy name we will tread them un|der

<P>Men may fail us, be overcome, and utterly fru&s;trate our expectations: but, if we tru&s;t in God, we may pray with A&s;a, when Zerab the Ethiopi|an came again&s;t him, with an ho&s;t of a Thou&s;and Thou&s;and, and three hundred Chariots; Lord, (&s;aid he) it is nothing with thee to help whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us O Lord our God, for we re&s;t on thee, &amp; in thy name we go again&s;t this multitude. O Lord thou art our God, let not man prevail again&s;t thee. The Lord of ho&s;ts is immortal, and in|vincible; he has all Creatures at his Command, and can cau&s;e the Stars in their cour&s;es to fight again&s;t the Enemies of his people; and &s;ell Si&s;e|ra into the hand of a woman. In a word, what|&s;oever the Lord plea&s;eth that he doth; it is there|fore better to tru&s;t in him, than to put confidence in man, P&s;al. 118.8.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Are the brave&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful &s;oldiers, liable to fall in battle, &s;uch then as are pre&s;erved in military expeditions and engage|ments and &s;afely returned to their families and friends, ought to &s;tudy what they &s;hall render to the Lord, and take heed, they dont forget his benefits, but that all their days they perform their vows. It is the Lord that has covered their heads in the battle; it is the Lord that re|deemed
<PB N="52" REF="036392_0051_1009E285A4D55240">
their lives from de&s;truction, when tho&s;e, no more expo&s;ed than they, are fallen, and gone down to the Grave and &s;hall come up no more, and return to their hou&s;es no more. O that all &s;uch as have experienced the di&s;tingui&s;hing favor of heaven, would prai&s;e him for his goodne&s;s, and not content them&s;elves to de&s;ire thanks to be returned for them in the public a&s;&s;emblies of God's people, though that is commendable, but that they would endeavour to live the prai&s;es of God. It is very di&s;plea&s;ing to God, when his people do not render to him according to his ben|efits, 2 Chron. 32.25. David celebrates the prai&s;es of God, for pre&s;ervation and &s;ucce&s;s in war, P&s;al. 18. &amp; P&s;al. 144 begin.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Hence the people of God ought to a&s;cribe to him the Glory of all their &s;ucce&s;s in war. His is the victory &amp; he gives it to whom|&s;oever he will. He furni&s;hes men with military &s;kill &amp; courage, teaches their hands to war and their fingers to fight. He finds out the Enemy for his people, and gives a pre&s;ence of mind to their forces; and if they are not &s;wallowed up quick, when men, va&s;tly &s;uperior in number, and other advantages ri&s;e up again&s;t them, it is be|cau&s;e the Lord is on their &s;ide, P&s;al&middot; 124. Again, we find Deborah and Barak giving Glory to God, for avenging his people in the defeat of Si&s;era &amp; his ho&s;t, Judg. 5. and how often is David the famous warrior of I&s;rael, harping on this &s;tring as we noted before.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="036392_0052_1009E287296FA698">God highly re&s;ents it, when his people &s;acri|fice to their own drag: when they a&s;cribe that to in&s;truments that is due to God alone. This no doubt often provokes God, to deprive a people of their cho&s;en &s;oldiers. For he is a very Jeal|ous God, and will not give his Glory to another. And as the former pa&s;tor of this Church would &s;ay of Mini&s;ters, we may &s;ay of &s;oldiers, people kill them two ways: either by a&s;cribing too much, or too little to them: idolizing of them.</P>
<P>Finally, Let us all religiou&s;ly lament the fall of the Brave LOVELL, and &s;everal of his Gallant Company, that offered them&s;elves willingly a|mong the people. Let us take up this lamenta|tion over them, how are the mighty fallen! and if we would herein approve our&s;elves to God, let us con&s;ider that the&s;e brave men (though I hope, we have many left as capable of &s;erving their Country) yet they were no con&s;iderable part of the beauty and &s;trength of New-England. In|deed, being wholly a &s;tranger to mo&s;t of them, I cannot pretend to give their character; yet it is evident to the Country, they were men formed and rai&s;ed up by Providence to &s;erve us in pur&s;u|ing an Enemy, of whom we may &s;ay as of the wild a&s;s, the wilderne&s;s yieldeth food for them and for their Children, Job 24.5.</P>
<P>The&s;e our worthy friends could endure hard|&s;hip as good &s;oldiers: and were well <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to en|counter the fatigues of long march, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> in
<PB N="54" REF="036392_0053_1009E289D63D5FE8">
winter and &s;ummer. Some of them were well acquainted with the woods, &amp; with the cu&s;toms and lurking places of the Enemy, &amp; were might|ily &s;pirited to pur&s;ue them, &amp; God did gra|ciou&s;ly pre&s;erve &amp; pro&s;per them this la&s;t winter in two expeditions, fir&s;t, delivered two <HI>Indians</HI> into their hands, &amp; then ten &s;tout fellows as you all remember, whom they killed, without receiv|ing any harm from them. This was the Lord's doings and marvelous in our eyes! and in this la&s;t engagement, they were in&s;pired with a great deal of bravery and good conduct, &amp; their com|pany crowned with wonderful &s;ucce&s;s. Now to lo&s;e &s;uch experienced &s;oldiers, and men &s;o re&s;|pected in the Country, is a great lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Again, Let us con&s;ider, that this is the finger of God. Let not any &s;ay prophanely and athe|i&s;tically, it is the fortune of war: or, as a good man &s;aid on a bad occa&s;ion, the &s;word devoureth one as well as another, 2 Sam. 11.25. For tho it is true the battle is not to the &s;trong, and time and chance happen to all men, yet the hand of the Lord, is herein gone out again&s;t us, there are tokens of his d&s;iplea&s;ure to be &s;een in this affair. That this brave company, &s;hould be &s;o weakned by leaving &s;o great a number with one that fell ill, and that at &s;o great a di&s;tance from them. That one of the Company &s;hould &s;o unhappily leave <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> in the beginning of the fight, &amp; bring &s;uch we <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> tho&s;e left behind, that occa&s;ioned
<PB N="55" REF="036392_0054_1009E28B746982D0">
their immediate return; when their continuance there, might have been &s;uch an un&s;peakable ad|vantage to tho&s;e that &s;urvived the battle. And indeed, it appears a frown, that they &s;hould ven|ture &s;o far with &s;o &s;mall a number at that &s;ea&s;on of the Year, when the Enemy are capable of bet|ter &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in bodies, than in the winter &s;ea|&s;on. I &s;ay, the hand of the Lord appears in all this, that &s;o many brave men &s;hould de&s;cend in|to battle and peri&s;h.</P>
<P>But then we are al&s;o to con&s;ider. Why the Lord's anger again&s;t us is not turned away; but his hand &s;tretched out &s;till. Have not our &s;ins as really &s;lain our magnanimous &s;oldiers, as ever, David &s;lew Uriah the Hittite by the &s;word of the children of Ammon? and &s;hould we not hear the rod, and him that hath appointed it: and con&s;ider in this day of adver&s;ity, what we have done; and humble our&s;elves and pray and &s;eek God's face? thus did David and his men, as in the context. And the men of Jabe&s;h Gilead, 1 Sam. ult.</P>
<P>Should we not endeavour to find out and put away the accur&s;ed thing from the mid&s;t of us? &amp; turn to him that &s;mites us? &s;hould we not be a|wakened by &s;uch providences to get our peace made with God, and engage and &s;ecure his gra|cious pre&s;ence with us, under our pre&s;ent dark views?</P>
<P>How many calls have New-England <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="56" REF="036392_0055_1009E28F8E9BD670">
the Pulpit, and by the Pre&s;s al&s;o, from Year to Year; to remember whence we are fallen and repent &amp; do our fir&s;t works! how many Election Sermons have been publi&s;hed among&s;t us, filled with &s;olemn warnings, mo&s;t earne&s;t exhortations and ample te&s;timonies for God, and again&s;t the provoking evils of the land! but alas, how ma|ny are &s;till acting the part of the deaf Adder, or as the Prophet expre&s;&s;es it, they refu&s;e to hearken, they pull away the &s;houlder and &s;top the ear that they &s;hould not hear, Zech. 7.11. How many hate to be reformed? yea hate to be told by tho&s;e that have good right, full power, &amp; law|ful authority to do it, wherein we &s;hould be, &amp; what is to be done that we may be a reformed People. How &s;ad is it, if all the notice taken by the generality of people, of the &s;olemn me&s;&s;ages &s;ent to them from the Lord God of their fathers, is only to give them the hearing and either humm or hi&s;s the Preacher and his performance, pretty much as they &s;tand affected to him; and it may be with &s;ome con&s;iderable formality, give him thanks for his &s;ermon (and then he comes off mighty well!) however if they carry the matter &s;o far as to Print the &s;ermon, yet perhaps they do not put it in practice! but now dont they de|ceive them&s;elves that hear, &amp; read God's word, but do it not? or, what meaneth that &s;aying, Jam. 1.22.</P>
<P>Furthermore, by the &s;ore judgement of war,
<PB N="57" REF="036392_0056_1009E292714A2618">
and particularly by the fall of our brethren, we are now weeping over, God is loudly calling upon us, to amend our ways and doings. And God expects we &s;hould all in our places endeav|or a reformation, that we &s;hould do our part in this work: and if we do &s;o, whatever be the e|vent, God will &s;et a mark upon us, and our labor &s;hall not be in vain in the Lord. Let not any then be di&s;couraged, becau&s;e &s;ome proper e&s;&s;ays and noble efforts have mi&s;caried and proved abortive. Nece&s;&s;ity is laid upon us: New-Eng|land mu&s;t reform, or without a &s;pirit of prophecy any one that ob&s;erves the &s;igns of the times, may I think, evidently fore&s;ee, that in one twenty Years more the glory of New-England as New-England, will be much more than hitherto, if not totally Eclip&s;ed. God in his infinite, &s;ove|reign mercy, prevent it!</P>
<P>But then, our &s;oldiers that are fit to go forth to war, and may probably be called forth, you my brethren in an e&s;pecial manner are obliged to take the alarm given you by the late Intelli|gence. Be prevailed with if you have not yet done &s;o, to ca&s;t away the weapons of your rebel|lion again&s;t Heaven, (for there is no making peace &s;word in hand) and come as with ropes about your necks, and lie in the du&s;t, if there may be hope; and there is hope in I&s;rael con|cerning you. Now is your time to make ready for Death. You will have other work to do,

when engaged in battle. And be&s;ides, every battle of the Warrior is with confu&s;ed noi&s;e, and garments rolled in blood: hearing the hide|ous yellings and ejaculations of the Enemy, and the groanings of deadly wounded men, &amp; &s;eeing them lie all bathed in their gore, may awaken you to cry to God and make your vows: but a|las, that is no time for con&s;ideration, and confe&s;|&s;ion, and deliberate re&s;olution to for&s;ake &s;in and return to God. This &s;hould be done now! &amp; then as you &s;hould be excited by this awakning providence to yield your&s;elves to the Lord; to make ha&s;t and not delay to believe in Chri&s;t, &amp; &s;ecure an intere&s;t in him: &s;o, you &s;hould be pre|vailed with to &s;ee that you have good arms and kept in good order, with good &s;tore of ammuni|tion, &amp; inure your&s;elves to military exerci&s;es, e&s;pecially to the art of &s;hooting, &amp; be always ready, that you may i&s;&s;ue out at an hour's warn|ing.</P>
