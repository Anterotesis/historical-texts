<HEAD>Mr. MURRAY <HI>unma&s;k'd.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MR. JOHN MURRAY, a little before his late <HI>evangelizing</HI> tour to the Ea&s;tward, while preaching, was plea&s;ed to inform his audi|tory, that he had been mi&s;repre&s;ented as holding <HI>Univer&s;al Salvation</HI>; declaring he did not hold <HI>that</HI> doctrine, but only <HI>Univer&s;al Redemption.</HI></P>
<P>It may be proper to weigh Mr. <HI>Murray</HI>'s de|claration in the <HI>balance</HI>; and to give him credit for all the truth there is in it.</P>
<P>And here&mdash;not to in&s;i&s;t on his being re|commended at fir&s;t, as one of Mr. <HI>Relly</HI>'s religion, who is the <HI>principal</HI> man for <HI>univer&s;al &s;alvation</HI>; nor on his recommending Mr. <HI>Relly</HI>'s works in favour of <HI>that</HI> doctrine, as profitable for the peo|ple of this Town, which he could not have done with a good con&s;cience, if he had not been <HI>like-minded:</HI> He him&s;elf for &s;everal months, hath been preaching univer&s;al &s;alvation in Bo&s;ton, perhaps as plainly, as Mr. <HI>Relly,</HI> or any one el&s;e ever preached it in <HI>England.</HI> The doctrine, that all who ever have lived, or &s;hall live on God's earth, &s;hall be <HI>&s;aved with an eternal &s;alvation,</HI> is &s;o contrary to
<PB N="4" REF="013998_0003_0F9258BDCDA44388">
the &s;cripture, and &s;o evidently tending to fill the world with &s;in and wickedne&s;s of all kinds, that it is not to be wondered at, if the preachers of <HI>this go&s;pel,</HI> who cannot have a <HI>divine boldne&s;s,</HI> walk in <HI>craftine&s;s,</HI> and &s;ometimes would have people think they deny it; whereby they <HI>deceive the hearts of the &s;imple.</HI> The foundation principle of the <HI>uni|ver&s;ali&s;ts</HI> is, that &s;ince the human nature &s;uffered, when Chri&s;t died, all that partake of it, let them be never &s;o bad, are pardoned and dearly beloved of God. Mr. <HI>Murray,</HI> is as full in this, as Mr. <HI>Relly.</HI> For he declared lately, <HI>three times over,</HI> before &s;ome hundreds of witne&s;&s;es, that he held,&mdash; <HI>The Almighty loves all men on earth, even the mo&s;t wicked and ungodly, as well as he loves true believers.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How &s;hocking this to chri&s;tian ears! Nay &s;hocking to the Dei&s;ts them&s;elves! He is not orthodox e|nough for <HI>them:</HI> For they look on it as a di&s;honour to God to &s;uppo&s;e vicious and wicked men are in|tere&s;ted in his favour.&mdash;Mr. <HI>Murray</HI> mu&s;t make the matter up with his good friends as well as he can.</NOTE> Now holding this <HI>univer&s;al love,</HI> is holding <HI>univer&s;al &s;alvation.</HI> For if wicked men cannot, by all their wickedne&s;s, &s;eparate them&s;elves from the love of God while they live; none will &s;ay they ever &s;eparate them&s;elves from it, in that &s;tate <HI>of darkne&s;s and ignorance,</HI> which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a&s;&s;igned to them after death: They mu&s;t therefore <HI>abide in the love of God</HI>; and as Mr. <HI>Relly</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>When Chri&s;t who is their life &s;hall appear, they &s;hall all appear with him in glory.</HI> I believe <HI>Logicians</HI> will &s;ay, the <HI>latter</HI> doc|trine is in&s;eperably connected with the <HI>former.</HI>&mdash;
<PB N="5" REF="013998_0004_0F9258BE68B28888">
This therefore would be enough to convict him: But be&s;ides, the tenor of his preaching bears, te&s;ti|mony again&s;t him. It is ob&s;ervable, that wherever Mr. Murray goes, wi&s;e men are all of one mind, as to what the principles are which he preaches: In Bo&s;ton they &s;ee <HI>eye to eye</HI>; it is plain as the me<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ian &s;un, that what he chiefly aims at, is to make people believe, that let them be never &s;o wicked, God loves them as well as if they were the be&s;t of &s;ai<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">s, and that whatever any may &s;uffer in a &s;tate of purgation, <HI>they</HI> at la&s;t, and <HI>all the world, &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI></P>
<P>Oftentimes it requires no depth of under&s;tand|ing to know what his drift is; it is level to the meane&s;t capacity: Which was particularly the ca&s;e, in his long, irrational, wicked and waggi&s;h expo&s;ition of the parable of the grain of mu&s;tard &s;eed, and the birds which lodged in the branches of it, when it grew up to a tree (Matth. chap. 13.) which made &s;o much &s;port for &s;everal evenings. All people of common &s;en&s;e &s;aw, his main de&s;ign was to let them know, that when the birds, i. e. the devils, departed from the branches, i. e. men and women, which would be at the la&s;t day, then all the human race would be happy forever. It is to this very doctrine, that he owes his popula|rity: By this he recommends him&s;elf to the &s;ons of infidelity. For a Dei&s;t looks upon a preacher, who is &s;o free with the Bible, as to hold all men <HI>&s;hall be &s;aved,</HI> to be near a kin, and calls him bro|ther in his heart. In a word, young rakes, and old &s;inners, tho&s;e who are hardned through the
<PB N="6" REF="013998_0005_0F92580E690B7240">
deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in, and have no thoughts of turn|ing to God, mu&s;t bear a warm &s;ide to him, for the benefit they receive from his labors; they are delivered from the qualms of con&s;cience, and walk in the broad way with greater comfort, becau&s;e they learn they can never &s;in them&s;elves out of the love of God, and that if they &s;erve the devil all their days, heaven will be their <HI>everla&s;ting home.</HI> But to proceed&mdash;</P>
<P>Mr. Murray's denying, that he holds <HI>univer&s;al &s;alvation,</HI> is the more a&s;toni&s;hing, becau&s;e he hath declared, <HI>in &s;o many words,</HI> that he looked on the opinion, that <HI>all &s;hall be &s;aved,</HI> to be the very doctrine of the Bible.</P>
<P>In the narrative of his conver&s;ation with a young preacher, a&s;&s;i&s;tant to Mr. <HI>Lord</HI> of <HI>Norwich,</HI> Aug. 8. 1774. After Mr. Murray had &s;aid, &s;ince our lives are hid with Chri&s;t in God, it is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that any men are &s;anctified or made holy in part (which alone ought to make chri&s;tians on their guard again&s;t him.) The dialogue proceeds in the following words: &mdash;Que&s;t. 4. Do you &s;up|po&s;e that all mankind will partake of the life that is hid with Chri&s;t in God? An&s;w. I hope &s;o: I wi&s;h all men happy. Que&s;t. further. But is it your fixed opinion, that all mankind will be hap|py, or &s;aved with an everla&s;ting &s;alvation? An&s;w. The &s;criptures day &s;o. Que&s;t. Where do they &s;ay &s;o? An&s;w. In many places; as 1. All fle&s;h &s;hall &s;ee the &s;alvation of God. And again, they &s;hall all know me. And again, as in Adam all died,
<PB N="7" REF="013998_0006_0F9258C22F8F1C20">
&s;o in Chri&s;t the &s;econd Adam, &s;hall all be made alive. And in thy &s;eed, &s;aith God to Abraham, (which &s;eed intends Chri&s;t) &s;hall all the families of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e texts rightly under&s;tood, don't help the cau&s;e at all: The true meaning of them may be found in the Expo&s;itions of Mr. Henry, Dr. Doddridge, and others.</NOTE></P>
<P>A true copy <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A Gentleman in town hath the whole copy.</NOTE> atte&s;t. <HI>David Huntington.</HI></P>
<P>The reader, will ob&s;erve, that in this dialogue, Mr. <HI>Murray</HI> declares, <HI>univer&s;al &s;alvation</HI> to be the <HI>very doctrine of the Bible:</HI> Which declaration is as contrary to that which he made from the pul|pit, Dec. 14. as the ea&s;t is to the we&s;t.</P>
<P>As both parts of a contradiction cannot be true, that which he a&s;&s;erted at <HI>Norwich,</HI> or <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>fal&s;e.</HI> The <HI>latter</HI> is &s;o evidently fal&s;e, that were he to &s;ay over a thou&s;and times what he &s;aid in the pulpit, wi&s;e men, however bias'd in his favour, could not force them&s;elves to believe it. One would think this <HI>di&s;overy</HI> would be <HI>humbling,</HI> and that he would be &s;hy of &s;hewing his face again in that pul|pit, where he was <HI>left</HI> to &s;ay, he did not hold all men &s;hould be &s;aved, even though he could get into it, without breaking open doors and windows, and appearing like a <HI>thief and a robber.</HI> But none of the&s;e things move him: He can put on a bold face, and make his hearers <HI>laugh</HI> and <HI>giggle</HI>; and while he is able to do this, he may be &s;ure of a train after him, in all populous places. His charging
<PB N="8" REF="013998_0007_0F9258C34B3FEDB8">
one al&s;o with printing a fal&s;ehood, for &s;aying he a&s;&s;erted, that tho&s;e who know them&s;elves to be the <HI>devil's children,</HI> and wicked men ought at the &s;ame time to believe <HI>they were God's beloved ones</HI>; had no more truth in it than the abovemen|tioned declaration. And it is remarkable that pro|vidence, which protects the innocent, brought it to pa&s;s, that he ju&s;tified him whom he had accu&s;ed with his own mouth, three times over, in the great con|gregation. What is the rea&s;on this preacher hath &s;o little regard to truth? It is the ea&s;ie&s;t thing in the world to account for it: It is owing to the go&s;|pel which he preaches. According to <HI>him,</HI> if any &s;hould be of the character of him, mentioned in the <HI>Spectator,</HI> who took pains to avoid &s;peaking truth, and &s;hould lie like &s;atan all their days, they would be as dear to God as any of his &s;aints; and the&s;e <HI>beloved lyars,</HI> would at la&s;t be received into the heavenly man&s;ions, which Chri&s;t as their forerunner, is gone to prepare for them! This is encouraging the lying bu&s;ine&s;s, quite as much as &s;atan could ex|pect from a chri&s;tian preacher! Nor is there any doubt but any one who believes all this, would balk the truth, were he tempted to it, and thought none would ever know it, but God who loves all lyars &s;o dearly, and will love them forever. The Popi&s;h religion encourages one &s;ort of lying; but this en|courages all &s;orts. And there is full as much rea|&s;on that the men of <HI>this Creed,</HI> &s;hould be di&s;quali|fyed for taking an oath, as the <HI>Papi&s;ts them&s;elves.</HI> And there is no doubt, but if God &s;hould &s;uffer it to &s;pread in Europe and America, the legi&s;lature would take care, that the pro&s;elytes &s;hould be legally
<PB N="9" REF="013998_0008_0F9258C537859F80">
incapacitated for any offices which required an oath, and for being evidences in any court of judicature. Nay, as hath been hinted, not only lying, but all &s;orts of wickedne&s;s are promoted by this new go&s;|pel. What glad tidings of great joy mu&s;t it bring to drunkards, animating them to go on impover|i&s;hing their families, de&s;troying their health, and drowning rea&s;on and con&s;cience; to believe that the almighty hath no greater favourites on earth, than the greate&s;t <HI>&s;ots,</HI> and that if they &s;hould die martyrs to <HI>Bacchus,</HI> they &s;hall be rai&s;ed to eternal life at the la&s;t day?</P>
<P>The &s;ame may be &s;aid of whoremongers and a|dulterers. No doubt a dreadful &s;ound is &s;ometimes <HI>in their</HI> ears, when they think of tho&s;e words; <HI>Whoremongers and adulterers God will judge</HI>; but how mu&s;t they be heartned to believe that God loves them as well as if they were cha&s;te; and that they &s;hall at la&s;t be pre&s;ented before the throne of Chri&s;t's glory with exceeding joy! It is ea&s;y to &s;ee that knaves, cheats, thieves and robbers, mu&s;t be multiplied and encouraged, by the &s;ame comforta|ble go&s;pel. To mention no more (I &s;peaks <HI>now</HI> only of the body) it is a <HI>murdering</HI> go&s;pel. How ea&s;ily can &s;atan per&s;uade a man to gratify his re|venge, or avarice, by &s;hedding his brother's blood, who believes that the words &s;poken to Daniel, O <HI>man greatly beloved of God,</HI> are applicable to every murderer; and that all murderers &s;hall have eter|nal life? The &s;hocking accounts we have heard or read of murders, are nothing for number to what they would have been, if this <HI>bloody</HI> go&s;pel had been
<PB N="10" REF="013998_0009_0F9258C5D0104A18">
commonly received: And if God &s;hould &s;uffer the <HI>leaven</HI> to &s;pread in the chri&s;tian world, one may foretell, without a &s;pirit of prophe&s;y, that thou&s;ands and ten thou&s;ands will be murder'd by it. Tho&s;e words of our Savior, by <HI>their fruits ye &s;hall know them</HI>; are applicable to <HI>doctrines</HI> as well as to <HI>men.</HI> Paul tells the Colo&s;&s;ians, the go&s;pel he preached a|mong them and others, brought forth <HI>fruit,</HI> i. e. the doctrine of life and &s;alvation by <HI>faith in Chri&s;t:</HI> Whoever received it as a divine record, brought forth <HI>fruit unto God.</HI> But the go&s;pel that <HI>all men &s;hall be &s;aved, whether they believe or not,</HI> cau&s;es tho&s;e who embrace it, as we have &s;een, to bring forth <HI>fruit unto &s;atan.</HI> And there is no doubt but &s;atan would be glad to have ten thou&s;and preachers of it, &s;pread up and down through all <HI>Chri&s;tendom.</HI> And as &s;uch preaching is &s;o evidently inimical to all vertue, and productive of all vice, no one can be a con&s;i&s;tent friend to morality, who is <HI>not</HI> an e|nemy to it. The judicious have ob&s;erved, that if it were really true, it would not be worth while for any to take pains in preaching it, &s;ince it would only make people in all re&s;pects wor&s;e than they were before. It is remarkable that Mr. <HI>Relly</HI> him|&s;elf (&s;o great was the force of truth!) owned in a pamphlet which Mr. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> an&s;wers,
<Q>That the preaching of it, would not be for the glory of Chri&s;t, nor for the real happine&s;s of men.</Q>
It &s;eems as if it made him &s;hudder to think of the hor|rible crop of wickedne&s;s which would be produced by &s;owing <HI>that &s;eed.</HI> And were Mr. <HI>Murray</HI> to inform him that not only vain, carnal, hardned, de|i&s;tical per&s;ons <HI>rejoiced in his light</HI>; but that &s;ome

FEW of a more &s;erious character heard <HI>him gladly</HI>; it would not he good news <HI>from a far country,</HI> un|le&s;s he hath much more zeal for a bad cau&s;e, than he had when he wrote that piece.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s to &s;ay &s;omething here of the pedigree of this doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation. It is not the <HI>Proton P&s;eudos</HI>; it is a derivative; it is the very bad offspring of as bad a parent. The pa|rental divinity to which it owes exi&s;tence (I will not mention the father's name) is, That the innocent Je&s;us was not puni&s;hed for guilty men; and that becau&s;e the human nature &s;uffer'd, when Chri&s;t &s;uffer'd, all that partake of it, are pardon'd and loved of God. As if Chri&s;t did not <HI>his own &s;elf,</HI> bear our &s;ins in his <HI>own body</HI> on the tree: This is deny|ing the Lord that bought us! All who &s;wallow u|niver&s;al &s;alvation, &s;wallows this bla&s;phemy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Relly in his <HI>Union,</HI> for &s;everal pages together, argues from the truth, wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice, holine&s;s and love of God, to prove 'tis ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to be true, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who knew no &s;in, was puni&s;h|ed for guilty &s;inners of Adam's race. This <HI>My&s;tery of Iniquity,</HI> which is a &s;ort of bible to the party, is about to &s;ee the light in America: It is to come out by thou&s;ands, like the &s;moke of the bottomle&s;s pit, to hide the &s;un light of the go&s;pel.</NOTE> along with it. It is melancholy to think that the preach|ers of this go&s;pel, &s;o bad in its effects, as well as pe|digree, &s;hould meet with any encouragement in town or country! But, whatever other encourage|ment he meets with, he hath not the comfort to think that &s;erious chri&s;tians, who know what he is after, pray for the ble&s;&s;ing of God on his labors. For,
<PB N="12" REF="013998_0011_0F9258C7443E8C40">
how dares any one go into his clo&s;et and pray that God by his Spirit would influence people to believe it is the doctrine of the bible, that God loves the devil's children as well as his own; and that all Chri&s;t's implacable enemies when he comes the &s;econd time to judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed and happy for ever? Serious admirers would tremble at this: And yet let me tell them, they cannot with a good con&s;cience encourage his preaching, unle&s;s they can find in their hearts, to pray this prayer. And it is not only melancholy, but very &s;urprizing that &s;ome of Mr. Whitefield's zealous admirers in one place and another, &s;hould receive this man as a teacher &s;ent from God. For what concord was thee between Mr. Whitefield and <HI>him</HI>? Mr. Whitefield preached much legal terror; this man none at all. Mr. Whitefield di|rected awakened &s;inners to get into a <HI>&s;tate</HI> of ju&s;ti|fication, by looking to Chri&s;t the antitype of the bra|zen &s;erpent: This man preaches all men are already in a <HI>&s;tate</HI> of ju&s;tification, without either faith or works.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Murray told the Public, he held, <HI>Ju&s;tification by faith with works;</HI> and yet he knew as well as that he had a &s;oul in his body, that he held what he was charged with, that men are in a <HI>&s;tate</HI> of ju&s;tification without faith, and without works too. This is mo&s;t evident from his forementioned threefold declaration before a cloud of witne&s;&s;es, viz. 'that he held, that all men, even the mo&s;t wicked &amp; ungodly under heaven, are intere&s;ted in the love of God, as much as true believ|ers' What did he do with his con&s;cience? It is wick|ed to talk deceitfully <HI>for God.</HI> But Mr. Murray imitates the pious frauds of the Romi&s;h Clergy, who e&s;tabli&s;h a <HI>fal&s;e</HI> religion with <HI>fal&s;ehood.</HI></NOTE>

Nor would any thing be more di&s;plea&s;ing to tho&s;e, who love the pro&s;perity of Zion in this town and el&s;ewhere.

For New-England never &s;aw &s;o dark a day: It is a day of rebuke and di&s;tre&s;s from the Lord of ho&s;ts, who dwelleth in mount Zion. The hearts of many are failing for fear; and God is calling us loudly by his providence, as well as word, to <HI>repent.</HI> But will Mr. Murray be of the character of tho&s;e preachers, whom Paul &s;tyles <HI>work|ers together with God?</HI> No: he will be a worker <HI>again&s;t God.</HI> He will per&s;uade people they have no <HI>need of repentance,</HI> by a&s;&s;uring them, if they &s;erve the devil all their days, God will love them as well as if they &s;erved him; and that if they never re|pent, or are converted, their &s;ins &s;hall be blotted out

The rea&s;on why the Author don't multiply &s;cripture pa&s;&s;ages again&s;t the impleaded doctrine is, that every hone&s;t man who reads the bible, mu&s;t be able to bring an hundred plain texts, to prove, that only tho&s;e who believe in Chri&s;t, and repent of their &s;ins, will be ble&s;&s;ed and happy at the re&s;urrection.</NOTE></P>
<P>God's permitting this man to vi&s;it the&s;e parts, and to &s;ow his tares &s;o plentifully in this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed town, is very puzzling. <HI>The ways of heaven are intricate and dark!</HI> But the &s;criptures not only a&s;|&s;ure us that there will be here&s;ies in the la&s;t days, but furni&s;hes us with a rea&s;on, 1 Cor. xi. ver. 19. <HI>For there mu&s;t be al&s;o here&s;ies among you, that they which are approved may be made manife&s;t among you:</HI> i. e. that &s;uch hone&s;t hearts as will bear the trial may be &s;et in view, and appear faithful by their con&s;tant adhering to the truth, notwith&s;tanding all temptations of &s;educers.</P>
<P>This is the rea&s;on that this man hath been &s;uffer|ed to vi&s;it this land; and particularly this town, viz. that it might appear who would be carried away with every wind of doctrine, and embrace another go&s;pel; and who would hold fa&s;t the form of &s;ound words delivered to us, and be like mount Zion that can never be moved. The Author, with &s;uitable re&s;pect to his fellow chri&s;tians, would propo&s;e what appears to him the will of God on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>We learn from Joh. ii. epi&s;t. v. 10. That if any man bring not this go&s;pel, which Paul preached,

To hear him for curio&s;ity, or diver&s;ion after &s;uch conviction, is what no con|&s;cientious per&s;on will plead for. And we &s;hould all pray to God for our&s;elves (and others too) that we may be e&s;tabli&s;hed by him, and not &s;uffered to fall from our own &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s. We &s;hould pray, that we may be kept from believing the doctrine of <HI>vicarious puni&s;hment</HI> to be <HI>fal&s;e,</HI> and from believing the doctrine of <HI>univer&s;al &s;alvation</HI> to be <HI>true,</HI> in the face of a thou&s;and texts of &s;cripture. We &s;hould take heed of an undue bia&s;s from others, either in a way of hope or fear.

<P>Here it may be &s;aid, can't a man who believes <HI>that</HI> go&s;pel, be in a &s;tate of &s;alvation? How can he be, if he hopes for &s;alvation only becau&s;e all &s;hall be &s;aved? This hope is not founded on the word of God, but on a contradiction to it, and cannot be the hope which <HI>maketh not a&s;hamed.</HI> It may be &s;aid, <HI>Joy is a fruit</HI> of the &s;pirit; and the pro&s;elytes &s;ay, they never knew what &s;piritual joy meant, till they believed the <HI>glad tidings of great joy</HI>&mdash;that the <HI>whole world &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI> Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> informs us it was common in his day for tho&s;e who embraced

The writer can never think, one who is not only almo&s;t, but altogether a chri&s;tian, will ever live and die a be|liever of the <HI>latter go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P>But it is time to think of a conclu&s;ion.&mdash; The author hath u&s;ed great plaine&s;s of &s;pecch, and been fervent in &s;pirit: Which will need no excu&s;e with tho&s;e who realize that the glory of Chri&s;t, and the &s;alvation of &s;ouls, are concerned in the contro|ver&s;y. Nor is he careful about the event with re|gard to him&s;elf: For one can never repent of what was done hone&s;tly for Chri&s;t, let the con&s;equences be what they will.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Brethren and Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE much &s;orrow of heart, con&s;idering the &s;tate of affairs among us.&mdash;I am far advanced in life, and labour under threatening maladies, and know not how &s;oon I may be taken from you, and from this world. As one drawing near the eternal world, I would give you caution. "Take heed what you hear." The &s;eeds of here&s;y are &s;owing and &s;prouting up among us; and &s;ouls are in dan|ger of being &s;educed into errors.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="013998_0018_0F9258D2265B4E30">There is one, who calls him&s;elf John Murray, who has declared the following things to be his &s;ettled opinion. &mdash;That the whole human race, every one of Adam's po&s;terity, have an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, and are God's beloved ones&mdash;That the whole human race, every individual of mankind, &s;hall be finally &s;aved&mdash;That Judas &s;hall &s;it upon a throne in the kingdom of heaven&mdash;That at death the good go in|to happine&s;s, and the bad into an intermediate &s;tate, a place of mi&s;ery, to abide there for a certain &s;ea|&s;on, but &s;hall finally be &s;av'd; which however dre&s;&s;ed up in &s;oft terms, and &s;mooth expre&s;&s;ions, is the very Popi&s;h purgatory.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;tance of the&s;e things, and many other errors, he hath openly avowed and fully declared to be his &s;entiments, at my hou&s;e, in the hearing of many witne&s;&s;es. The&s;e are un&s;criptural tenets, and notwith&s;tanding all his perverting of the holy &s;crip|tures, and wre&s;ting and torturing the word of God, he was not able to produce one plau&s;ible proof, nor one rational argument for the &s;upport of the&s;e pernicious principles. They naturally lead to many other gro&s;s errors and Popi&s;h ab&s;urdities.&mdash;And they are extremely dangerous to the &s;ouls of men: They encourage, the wicked in their wickedne&s;s; for up|on the&s;e principles a man may live and die in &s;in, and yet get to heaven at la&s;t; he may get drunk, and commit fornication and adultery; he may cheat, and &s;teal, and lie, and indulge all manner of carnal gratifications and be &s;aved notwith&s;tanding.&mdash; But you may &s;ay you don't di&s;cover any of the&s;e errors in his preaching&mdash;Why others who have beeen

accounted &s;erious, di&s;cerning, judicious men, and who&s;e judgment would heretofore have had &s;ome weight in your minds, have di&s;covered them in his public di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>But however he &s;eems artfully to hide them.&mdash; Your minds are not prepared to receive them; your affections mu&s;t fir&s;t be broke off from your mini&s;ters, and your minds filled with prejudices a|gain&s;t them, by their being reviled and vilified, and your affections &s;et upon him&s;elf, and you brought to receive the words of his mouth with an implicit faith, then doubtle&s;s the&s;e dangerous doctrines, and many others will be inculcated.</P>
<P>My brethren and friends, I mu&s;t caution you to take heed and beware of fal&s;e teachers&mdash;Beware, le&s;t ye be led away with errors, and fall from your &s;ted|fa&s;tne&s;s&mdash;Beware of fal&s;e prophets&punc; concerning whom our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour hath warned us, "that if it were po&s;&s;ible they &s;hall deceive the very Elect."</P>
