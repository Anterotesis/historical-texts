<HEAD>TREATY of Amity and Commerce between his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, and the thirteen United States of America.</HEAD>
<P>THE Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, and the thirteen United States of North America, <HI>to wit,</HI> New-Hamp&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-bay, Rhode-I&s;land, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jer&s;ey, Penn&s;ylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina, and Georgia, willing to fix, in an equitable and permanent manner, the rules which ought to be followed relative to the corre&s;pond|ence and commerce which the two parties de&s;ire to e&s;|tabli&s;h between their re&s;pective countries, &s;tates, and &s;ub|jects; his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, and the &s;aid United States, have judged, that the &s;aid end could not be better obtained, than by taking for the ba&s;is of their agreement, the mo&s;t perfect equality and reciprocity, and by carefully avoiding all tho&s;e burden&s;ome preferences, which are u&s;ually &s;ources of debate, embarra&s;&s;ment, and di&s;content &mdash;by leaving al&s;o each party at liberty to make, re&s;pect|ing commerce and navigation, tho&s;e interior regulations, which it &s;hall find mo&s;t convenient to it&s;elf&mdash;and by found|ing the advantage of commerce &s;olely upon reciprocal utility, and the ju&s;t rules of free intercour&s;e&mdash;re&s;erving withal, to each party, the liberty of admitting, at its plea&s;|ure, other nations to a participation of the &s;ame advan|tages. It is in the &s;pirit of this intention, and to fulfil the&s;e views, that his &s;aid Maje&s;ty having named and ap|pointed for his Plenipotentiary, Conrod Alexander Ger|ard, royal &s;yndic of the city of Stra&s;bourg, &s;ecretary of his Maje&s;ty's council of &s;tate&mdash;and the United States on their part, having fully empowered Benjamin Franklin, deputy from the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania to the general

Congre&s;s, and pre&s;ident to the convention of &s;aid &s;tate&mdash; Silas Deane, late deputy from the &s;tate of Connecticut, to the &s;aid Congre&s;s&mdash;and Arthur Lee, coun&s;ellor at law: the &s;aid re&s;pective plenipotentiaries, after exchanging their powers, and after mature deliberation, have concluded and agreed upon the following articles:</P>
<P>ART. I. THERE &s;hall be a firm, inviolable, and univer&s;al peace, and a true and &s;incere friend&s;hip, between the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, his heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and the United States of America, and the &s;ubjects of the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, and of the &s;aid &s;tates, and between the countries, i&s;lands, cities, and towns, &s;ituate under the ju|ri&s;diction of the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, and of the &s;aid United States, and the people and inhabitants of every degree, without exception of per&s;ons or places, and the terms herein after mentioned, &s;hall be perpetual between the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, his heirs, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and the &s;aid United States.</P>
<P N="2">II. The Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, and the United States, engage mutually not to grant any particular favour to other nations, in re&s;pect of commerce and navigation, which &s;hall not immediately become common to the other party, who &s;hall enjoy the &s;ame favour freely, if the con|ce&s;&s;ion was freely made&mdash;or on allowing the &s;ame com|pen&s;ation, if the conce&s;&s;ion was conditional.</P>
<P N="3">III. The &s;ubjects of the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, &s;hall pay in the ports, havens, roads, countries, i&s;lands, cities, or towns of the United States, or any of them, no other or greater duties or impo&s;ts, of what nature &s;oever they may be, or by what name &s;oever called, than tho&s;e which the nations mo&s;t favoured are or &s;hall be obliged to pay: and they &s;hall enjoy all the rights, liberties, privileges, immunities, and exemptions in trade, navigation, and commerce, whether in pa&s;&s;ing from one port in the &s;aid &s;tates to another, or in going to and from the &s;ame, from and to any part of the world, which the &s;aid nations do or &s;hall enjoy.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The &s;ubjects, people, and inhabitants of the &s;aid United States, and each of them, &s;hall not pay in the ports, havens, roads, i&s;les, cities, and places, under the domination of his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty in Europe, any other or greater duties or impo&s;ts, of what nature &s;oever
<PB N="5" REF="033045_0004_0FF62F4FB238B850">
they may be, or by what name &s;oever called, than tho&s;e which the mo&s;t favoured nations are or &s;hall be obliged to pay: and they &s;hall enjoy all the rights, liberties, pri|vileges, immunities, and exemptions in trade, navigation, and commerce, whether in pa&s;&s;ing from one port in the &s;aid dominions in Europe, to another, or in going to and from the &s;ame, from and to any part of the world, which the &s;aid nations do or &s;hall enjoy.</P>
<P N="5">V. In the above exemption is particularly compri&s;ed the impo&s;ition of one hundred &s;ols per ton, e&s;tabli&s;hed in France on foreign &s;hips, unle&s;s when the &s;hips of the Uni|ted States &s;hall load with the merchandize of France, for another port of the &s;ame dominion: in which ca&s;e, the &s;aid &s;hips &s;hall pay the duty above mentioned, &s;o long as other nations the mo&s;t favoured &s;hall be obliged to pay it: but it is under&s;tood, that the &s;aid United States, or any of them, are at liberty, when they &s;hall judge it proper, to e&s;tabli&s;h a duty equivalent in the &s;ame ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King &s;hall endeavour, by all the means in his power, to protect and defend all ve&s;&s;els, and the effects, belonging to the &s;ubjects, people, or in|habitants of the &s;aid United States, or any of them, be|ing in his ports, havens, or roads, or on the &s;eas near to his countries, i&s;lands, cities, or towns; and to recover and re&s;tore to the right owners, their agents, or attornies, all &s;uch ve&s;&s;els and effects, which &s;hall be taken within his juri&s;diction: and the &s;hips of war of his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, or any convoy &s;ailing under his authority, &s;hall upon all occa&s;ions, take under their protection, all ve&s;&s;els belonging to the &s;ubjects, people, or inhabitants of the &s;aid United States, or any of them, and holding the &s;ame cour&s;e, or going the &s;ame way, and &s;hall defend &s;uch ve&s;|&s;els as long as they hold the &s;ame cour&s;e, or go the &s;ame way, again&s;t all attacks, force, and violence, in the &s;ame manner as they ought to protect and defend the ve&s;&s;els belonging to the &s;ubjects of the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King.</P>
<P N="7">VII. In like manner the &s;aid United States, and their &s;hips of war &s;ailing under their authority, &s;hall pro|tect and defend, conformably to the tenor of the preced|ing article, all the ve&s;&s;els and effects belonging to the &s;ub|jects of the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, and u&s;e all their en|deavours to recover, and cau&s;e to be re&s;tored, the &s;aid
<PB N="6" REF="033045_0005_0FF62F51B3858B70">
ve&s;&s;els and effects that &s;hall have been taken within the juri&s;diction of the &s;aid United States, or any of them.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King will employ his good offices and interpo&s;ition with the King or Emperor of Morocco or Fez&mdash;the Regencies of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, or with any of them&mdash;and al&s;o with every other prince, &s;tate, or power, of the coa&s;t of Barbary in Africa &mdash;and the &s;ubjects of the &s;aid king, emperor, &s;tates, and powers, and each of them, in order to provide, as fully and efficaciou&s;ly as po&s;&s;ible, for the benefit, conveniency, and &s;afety of the United States, and each of them, their &s;ubjects, people, and inhabitants, and their ve&s;&s;els and ef|fects, again&s;t all violence, in&s;ult, attacks, or depredations, on the part of the &s;aid princes and &s;tates of Barbary, or their &s;ubjects.</P>
<P N="9">IX. The &s;ubjects, inhabitants, merchants, command|ers of &s;hips, ma&s;ters, and mariners of the &s;tates, provinces, and dominions of each re&s;pectively, &s;hall ab&s;tain and for|bear to fi&s;h in all places po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, or which &s;hall be po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by the other party. The Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King's &s;ubjects &s;hall not fi&s;h in the havens, bays, creeks, roads, coa&s;ts, or places, which the &s;aid United States hold, or &s;hall hereafter hold: and in like manner, the &s;ubjects, people, and inhabitants of the &s;aid United States, &s;hall not fi&s;h in the havens, bays, creeks, roads, coa&s;ts, or places, which the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, or &s;hall hereafter po&s;&s;e&s;s: and if any &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el &s;hall be found fi&s;hing, contrary to the tenor of this treaty, the &s;aid &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el with its lading (proof being made thereof) &s;hall be con|fi&s;cated: it is, however, under&s;tood that the exclu&s;ion &s;tipulated in the pre&s;ent article, &s;hall take place only &s;o long and &s;o far, as the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King or the Uni|ted States &s;hall not, in this re&s;pect, have granted an ex|emption to &s;ome other nation.</P>
<P N="10">X. The United States, their citizens and inhabitants, &s;hall never di&s;turb the &s;ubjects of the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, in the enjoyment and exerci&s;e of the right of fi&s;hing on the banks of Newfoundland&mdash;nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the indefinite and exclu&s;ive right which belongs to them on that part of the coa&s;t of that i&s;land, which is de&s;igned by the treaty of Utrecht&mdash;nor in the rights relative to all and each of the i&s;les, which belong to his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, the
<PB N="7" REF="033045_0006_0FF62F53DA0B8AA0">
whole conformable to the true &s;en&s;e of the treaties of Utrecht and Paris.</P>
<P N="11">XI. The &s;ubjects and inhabitants of the &s;aid United States, or any of them, &s;hall not be reputed aubains in France; and con&s;equently &s;hall be exempted from the <HI>droit d'aubaine,</HI> or other &s;imilar duty, under what name &s;oever. They may, by te&s;tament, donation, or otherwi&s;e, di&s;po&s;e of their goods, moveable and immoveable, in fav|our of &s;uch per&s;ons as to them &s;hall &s;eem good; and their heirs, &s;ubjects of the &s;aid United States, re&s;iding whether in France or el&s;ewhere, may &s;ucceed them, <HI>ab inte&s;tat,</HI> without being obliged to obtain letters of naturalization, and without having the effect of this conce&s;&s;ion conte&s;ted or impeded, under pretext of any rights or prerogatives of provinces, cities, or private per&s;ons. And the &s;aid heirs, whether &s;uch by particular title, or <HI>ab inte&s;tat,</HI> &s;hall be exempt from all duty called <HI>droit de detraction,</HI> or other duty of the &s;ame kind; &s;aving neverthele&s;s the lo|cal rights or duties, as much and as long as &s;imilar ones are not e&s;tabli&s;hed by the United States, or any of them. The &s;ubjects of the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King &s;hall enjoy on their part, in all the dominions of the &s;aid States, an en|tire and perfect reciprocity, relative to the &s;tipulations contained in the pre&s;ent article: but it is at the &s;ame time agreed, that its contents &s;hall not affect the laws made, or that may be made hereafter in France, again&s;t emigrations, which &s;hall remain in all their force and vig|our: and the United States on their part, or any of them, &s;hall be at liberty to enact &s;uch laws, relative to that matter, as to them &s;hall &s;eem proper.</P>
<P N="12">XII. The merchant-&s;hips of either of the parties, which &s;hall be making into a port belonging to the enemy of the other ally, and concerning who&s;e voyage, and the &s;pe|cies of goods on board her, there &s;hall be ju&s;t grounds of &s;u&s;picion, &s;hall be obliged to exhibit, as well upon the high &s;eas, as in the ports and havens, not only her pa&s;&s;|ports, but likewi&s;e certificates, expre&s;sly &s;hewing that her goods are not of the number of tho&s;e which have been prohibited as contraband.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. If, by the exhibiting of the above-&s;aid certificates, the other party di&s;cover there are any of tho&s;e &s;orts of goods which are prohibited and declared contraband, and

<P N="14">XIV. On the contrary, it is agreed, that whatever &s;hall be found to be laden by the &s;ubjects and inhabitants of either party on any &s;hip belonging to the enemies of the other, or to their &s;ubjects, the whole, although it be not of the &s;ort of prohibited goods, may be confi&s;cated in the &s;ame manner as if it belonged to the enemy, ex|cept &s;uch goods and merchandizes as were put on board &s;uch &s;hip before the declaration of war, or even after &s;uch declaration if &s;o be it were done without knowledge of &s;uch declaration: &s;o that the goods of the &s;ubjects and people of either party, whether they be of the nature of &s;uch as are prohibited or otherwi&s;e, which, as is afore|&s;aid,
<PB REF="033045_0008_0FF62F57C9578678">
&s;aid, were put on board any &s;hip belonging to an enemy before the war, or after the declaration of the &s;ame, with|out the knowledge of it, &s;hall no ways be liable to con|fi&s;cation, but &s;hall well and truly be re&s;tored without de|lay to the proprietors demanding the &s;ame; but &s;o as that if the &s;aid merchandizes be contraband, it &s;hall not be any-ways lawful to carry them afterwards to any ports belonging to the enemy. The two contracting parties agree, that the term of two months being pa&s;&s;ed after the declaration of war, their re&s;pective &s;ubjects, from what|ever part of the world they come, &s;hall not plead the ig|norance mentioned in this article.</P>
<P N="15">XV. And that more effectual care may be taken for the &s;ecurity of the &s;ubjects and inhabitants of both par|ties, that they &s;uffer no injury by the men of war or pri|vateers of the other party, all the commanders of the &s;hips of his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty and of the &s;aid United States, and all their &s;ubjects and inhabitants, &s;hall be for|bidden doing any injury or damage to the other &s;ide; and if they act to the contrary, they &s;hall be puni&s;hed: and &s;hall moreover be bound to make &s;atisfaction for all matter of damage, and the intere&s;t thereof, by reparation, under the pain and obligation of their per&s;on and goods.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. All &s;hips and merchandizes, of what nature &s;oever, which &s;hall be re&s;cued out of the hands of any pi|rates or robbers on the high &s;eas, &s;hall be brought into &s;ome port of either &s;tate, and &s;hall be delivered to the cu&s;tody of the officers of that port, in order to be re&s;tored entire to the true proprietor, as &s;oon as due and &s;ufficient proof &s;hall be made concerning the property thereof.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. It &s;hall be lawful for the &s;hips of war of either party, and privateers, freely to carry, whither&s;o|ever they plea&s;e, the &s;hips and goods taken from their enemies, without being obliged to pay any duty to the officers of the admiralty, or any other judges: nor &s;hall &s;uch prizes be arre&s;ted or &s;eized, when they come to, and enter the ports of either party: nor &s;hall the &s;earchers or other officers of tho&s;e places &s;earch the &s;ame, or make examination concerning the lawfulne&s;s of the prizes: but they may hoi&s;t &s;ail at any time, and depart, and carry their prizes to the places expre&s;&s;ed in their commi&s;&s;ions, which the commanders of &s;uch &s;hips of war &s;hall be
<PB N="10" REF="033045_0009_0FF62F59647298D0">
obliged to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">: on the contrary, no &s;helter or refuge &s;hall be given in their ports to &s;uch as &s;hall have made prize of the &s;ubjects, people, or property of either of the parties; but if &s;uch &s;hall come in, being forced by &s;tre&s;s of weather, or the danger of the &s;ea, all proper means &s;hall be vigorou&s;ly u&s;ed, that they go out and retire from thence as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. If any &s;hip, belonging to either of the par|ties, their people, or &s;ubjects, &s;hall, within the coa&s;ts or dominions of the other, &s;tick upon the &s;ands, or be wrecked, or &s;uffer any other damage&mdash;all friendly a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance and relief &s;hall be given to the per&s;ons &s;hip-wrecked, or &s;uch as &s;hall be in danger thereof. And letters of &s;afe-conduct &s;hall likewi&s;e be given to them, for their free and quiet pa&s;&s;age from thence, and the return of every one to his own country.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. In ca&s;e the &s;ubjects and inhabitants of either party, with their &s;hipping, whether public and of war, or private and of merchants, be forced through &s;tre&s;s of weather, pur&s;uit of pirates, or enemies, or any other ur|gent nece&s;&s;ity for &s;eeking of &s;helter and harbour, to re|treat and enter into any of the rivers, bays, roads, or ports belonging to the other party, they &s;hall be received and treated with all humanity and kindne&s;s, and enjoy all friendly protection and help: and they &s;hall be per|mitted to refre&s;h and provide them&s;elves, at rea&s;onable rates, with victuals, and all things needful for the &s;u&s;te|nance of their per&s;ons, or reparation of their &s;hips, and conveniency of their voyage: and they &s;hall no ways be detained or hindered from returning out of the &s;aid ports or roads, but may remove and depart, when, and whither they plea&s;e, without any let or hindrance.</P>
<P N="20">XX. For the better promoting of commerce on both &s;ides, it is agreed, that if a war &s;hall break out between the &s;aid two nations, &s;ix months after the proclamation of war, &s;hall be allowed to the merchants, in the cities and towns where they live, for &s;elling and tran&s;porting their goods and merchandizes: and, if any thing be tak|en from them, or any injury be done them within that term, by either party, or the people or &s;ubjects of either, full &s;atisfaction &s;hall be made for the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. No &s;ubjects of the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King &s;hall
<PB N="11" REF="033045_0010_0FF62F5AEF87A5F8">
apply for, or take any commi&s;&s;ion or letters of marque, for arming any &s;hip or &s;hips to act as privateers again&s;t the &s;aid United States, or any of them, or again&s;t the &s;ubjects, people, or inhabitants of the &s;aid United States, or any of them, or again&s;t the property of any of the in|habitants of any of them, from any prince or &s;tate with which the &s;aid United States &s;hall be at war: nor &s;hall any citizen, &s;ubject, or inhabitant of the &s;aid United States, or any of them, apply for, or take any commi&s;|&s;ion or letters of marque, for arming any &s;hip or &s;hips, to act as privateers again&s;t the &s;ubjects of the Mo&s;t Chri&s;|tian King, or any of them, or the property of any of them, from any prince or &s;tate with which the &s;aid king &s;hall be at war: and if any per&s;on of either nation &s;hall take &s;uch commi&s;&s;ions or letters of marque, he &s;hall be puni&s;hed as a pirate.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. It &s;hall not be lawful for any foreign priva|teers, not belonging to &s;ubjects of the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, nor citizens of the &s;aid United States, who have commi&s;&s;ions from any other prince or &s;tate in enmity with either nation, to fit their &s;hips in the ports of either the one or the other of the afore&s;aid parties, to &s;ell what they have taken, or in any other manner what&s;oever, to ex|change their &s;hips, merchandizes, or any other lading: neither &s;hall they be allowed even to purcha&s;e victuals, except &s;uch as &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary for their going to the next port of that prince or &s;tate from which they have commi&s;&s;ions.</P>

<HEAD>TREATY of Alliance Eventual and Defen&s;ive, between his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, and the thirteen United States of America.</HEAD>
<P>THE Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, and the United States of North-America, to wit, New-Hamp&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts-bay, Rhode-I&s;land, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jer&s;ey, Penn&s;ylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina, and Georgia, having this day concluded a Treaty of Amity and Commerce, for the reciprocal advantage of their &s;ubjects and citizens, have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to take into con&s;ideration the means of &s;trengthening tho&s;e engagements, and of render|ing them u&s;eful to the &s;afety and tranquillity of the two parties; particularly in ca&s;e Great-Britain, in re&s;entment of that connexion, and of the good corre&s;pondence which is the object of the &s;aid treaty, &s;hould break the peace with France, either by direct ho&s;tilities, or by hindering her commerce and navigation in a manner contrary to the rights of nations, and the peace &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the two crowns. And his Maje&s;ty and the &s;aid United States, having re&s;olved in that ca&s;e, to join their councils and efforts again&s;t the enterpri&s;es of their common enemy&mdash;</P>
<P>The re&s;pective Plenipotentiaries, empowered to concert the clau&s;es and conditions proper to fulfil the &s;aid inten|tions, have, after the mo&s;t mature deliberation, concluded and determined on the following articles.</P>
<P N="1">I. If war &s;hould break out between France and Great-Britain, during the continuance of the pre&s;ent war be|tween the United States and England, his Maje&s;ty and the &s;aid United States &s;hall make it a common cau&s;e, and aid each other mutually with their good offices, their coun&s;els, and their forces, according to the exigence of conjunctures, as becomes good and faithful allies.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="17" REF="033045_0016_0FF62F66AE560B98">II. The e&s;&s;ential and direct end of the pre&s;ent defen|&s;ive alliance is, to maintain effectually the liberty, &s;over|eignty, and independence, ab&s;olute and unlimited, of the &s;aid United States, as well in matters of government, as of commerce.</P>
<P N="3">III. The two contracting parties &s;hall, each on its own part, and in the manner it may judge mo&s;t proper, make all the efforts in its power again&s;t their common enemy, in order to attain the end propo&s;ed.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The contracting parties agree, that in ca&s;e either of them &s;hould form any particular enterpri&s;e, in which the concurrence of the other may be de&s;ired, the party, who&s;e concurrence is de&s;ired, &s;hall readily and with good faith join to act in concert for that purpo&s;e, as far as cir|cum&s;tances and its own particular &s;ituation will permit. And in that ca&s;e, they &s;hall regulate by a particular con|vention, the quantity and kind of &s;uccour to be furni&s;hed, and the time and manner of its being brought into action, as well as the advantages which are to be its com|pen&s;ation.</P>
<P N="5">V. If the United States &s;hould think fit to attempt the reduction of the Briti&s;h power, remaining in the north|ern parts of America, or the i&s;lands of Bermudas, tho&s;e countries or i&s;lands, in ca&s;e of &s;ucce&s;s, &s;hall be confede|rated with, or dependent upon the &s;aid United States.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King renounces forever, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;lands of Bermudas, as well as of any part of the continent of North-America, which before the Treaty of Paris, in 1763, or in virtue of that Treaty, were acknowledged to belong to the crown of Great-Britain, or to the United States, heretofore called Briti&s;h colonies, or which are at this time, or have lately been under the power of the king and crown of Great-Britain.</P>
<P N="7">VII. If his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty &s;hall think proper to attack any of the i&s;lands &s;ituated in the gulf of Mexico, or near that gulf, which are at pre&s;ent under the power of Great-Britain, all the &s;aid i&s;les, in ca&s;e of &s;ucce&s;s, &s;hall appertain to the crown of France.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Neither of the two parties &s;hall conclude either trace or peace with Great-Britain, without the formal con&s;ent of the other fir&s;t obtained: and they mutually engage not to lay down their arms, until the independ|ence
<PB N="18" REF="033045_0017_0FF62F43781D3FE8">
of the United States &s;hall have been formally or tacitly a&s;&s;ured, by the treaty or treaties that &s;hall termin|ate the war.</P>
<P N="9">IX. The contracting parties declare, that being re|&s;olved to fulfil each on its own part, the clau&s;es and con|ditions of the pre&s;ent Treaty of Alliance, according to its own power and circum&s;tances, there &s;hall be no after-claim of compen&s;ation, on one &s;ide or the other, whatever may be the event of the war.</P>
<P N="10">X. The Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King and the United States, agree to invite or admit other powers, who may have received injuries from England, to make a common cau&s;e with them, and to accede to the pre&s;ent alliance, under &s;uch conditions as &s;hall be freely agreed to, and &s;ettled between all the parties.</P>
<P N="11">XI. The two parties guarantee mutually from the pre&s;ent time and forever, again&s;t all other powers, to wit, the United States to his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, the pre&s;|ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the crown of France in America, as well as tho&s;e which it may acquire by the future Treaty of Peace: and his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty guarantees on his part to the United States, their liberty, &s;overeignty, and independence, ab&s;olute and unlimited, as well in matters of government, as commerce&mdash;and al&s;o their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and the additions or conque&s;ts that their con|federation may obtain during the war, from any of the dominions now or heretofore po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Great-Britain in North-America, conformable to the fifth and &s;ixth articles above-written; the whole, as their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, &s;hall be fixed and a&s;&s;ured to the &s;aid &s;tates, at the moment of the ce&s;&s;ation of their pre&s;ent war with England.</P>
<P N="12">XII. In order to fix more preci&s;ely the &s;en&s;e and ap|plication of the preceding article, the contracting parties declare, that in ca&s;e of a rupture between France and England, the reciprocal guarantee declared in the &s;aid article, &s;hall have its full force and effect, the moment &s;uch war &s;hall break out: and if &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hall not take place, the mutual obligations of the &s;aid guarantee &s;hall not commence until the momen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">tion of the pre&s;ent war, between the United State<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and England, &s;hall have a&s;certained their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>

They &s;hall make plats and keep journals of their proceedings, which &s;hall be con&s;idered as part of this convention, and &s;hall have the &s;ame force as if they were in&s;erted therein. And if on any account it &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary that the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioners and &s;urvey|ors &s;hould be accompanied by guards, they &s;hall be fur|ni&s;hed in equal proportions by the commanding officer of his Maje&s;ty's troops in the two Floridas, and the com|manding officer of the troops of the United States in their &s;outhwe&s;tern territory, who &s;hall act by common con&s;ent, and amicably, as well with re&s;pect to this point as to the furni&s;hing of provi&s;ions and in&s;truments, and making every other arrangement which may be nece&s;&s;ary or u&s;eful for the execution of this article.</P>
