<HEAD>MY OWN LIFE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is difficult for a man to &s;peak long of him&s;elf without vani|ty; therefore, I &s;hall be &s;hort. It may be thought an in&s;tance of va|nity that I pretend at all to write my life; but this Narrative &s;hall contain little more than the Hi&s;|tory of my Writings; as, indeed, almo&s;t all my life has been &s;pent in literary pur&s;uits and occupati|ons. The fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;s of mo&s;t of my writings was not &s;uch as to be an object of vanity.</P>
<P>I was born the 26th of April 1711, old &s;tyle, at Edinburgh. I was of a good family, both by father and mother: my father's family is a branch of the Earl of Home's, or Hume's; and my ance&s;tors had been proprietors of the e&s;tate, which my brother po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es, for &s;everal generations. My mother was daughter of Sir David Falconer, Pre&s;ident of the College of Ju&s;tice: the title of Lord Halkerton came by &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion to her brother.</P>
<P>My family, however, was not rich, and being my&s;elf a younger brother, my patrimony, accord|ing to the mode of my country, was of cour&s;e very &s;lender. My father, who pa&s;&s;ed for a man of parts, died when I was an infant, leaving me, with an elder bro|ther and a &s;i&s;ter, under the care of our mother, a woman of &s;in|gular merit, who, though young and hand&s;ome, devoted her&s;elf entirely to the rearing and edu|cating of her children. I pa&s;&s;ed through the ordinary cour&s;e of e|ducation with &s;ucce&s;s, and was &s;eized very early with a pa&s;&s;ion for literature, which has been the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of my life, and the great &s;ource of my enjoyments. My &s;tudious di&s;po&s;ition, my &s;o|briety, and my indu&s;try, gave my family a notion that the law
<PB N="4" REF="015853_0003_0F9A2E6F10094D08">
was a proper profe&s;&s;ion for me; but I found an un&s;urmountable a|ver&s;ion to every thing but the pur&s;uits of philo&s;ophy and gene|ral learning; and while they fan|cied I was poring upon Voet and Vinnius, Cicero and Virgil were the authors which I was &s;ecretly devouring.</P>
<P>My very &s;lender fortune, how|ever, being un&s;uitable to this plan of life, and my health being a little broken by my ardent ap|plication, I was tempted, or ra|ther forced, to make a very fee|ble trial for entering into a more a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ive &s;cene of life. In 1734, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">t to Bri&s;tol, with &s;ome re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mmendations to eminent mer|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hants, but in a few months found that &s;cene to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ally un&s;uitable to me. I went over to France, with a view of pro&s;ecuting my &s;tudies in a country retreat; and I there laid that plan of life, which I have &s;teadily and &s;uc|ce&s;sfully pur&s;ued. I re&s;olved to make a very rigid frugality &s;up|ply my deficiency of fortune, to maintain unimpaired my inde|pendency, and to regard every object as contemptible, except the improvement of my talents in literature.</P>
<P>During my retreat in France, fir&s;t at Reims, but chiefly at La Fleche, in Anjou I compo&s;ed my <HI>Treati&s;e of Human Nature.</HI> After pa&s;&s;ing three years very a|greeably in that country, I came over to Lond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n in 1737. In the end of 1738, I publi&s;hed my Treati&s;e, and immediately went down to my mother and my bro|ther, who lived at his country-hou&s;e, and was employing him|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lf very judiciou&s;ly and &s;ucce&s;s|fully in the improvement of his fortune</P>
<P>Never literary attempt was more unfortunate than my Trea|ti&s;e of Human Nature. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fell <HI>dead born from the pre&s;s,</HI> without reaching &s;uch di&s;tinction, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> even to excite a mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mur <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the zealots.

In 1742, I printed at Edi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">burgh the fir&s;t part of my E&s;&s;ays: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he work was favourably received, and &s;oon made me entirely forget my for|mer di&s;appointment. I continued with my mother and brother in the country, and in that time re|covered the knowledge of the Greek language, which I had too much neglected in my early youth.</P>
<P>In 1745, I received a letter from the Marquis of Annandale, inviting me to come and live with him in England; I found al&s;o, that the friends and family of that young nobleman were de&s;irous of putting him under my care and direction, for the &s;tate of his mind and health required it.&mdash;I lived with him a twelve-month. My appointments during that time made a con&s;iderable acce&s;&s;ion to my &s;mall fortune. I then re|ceived an invitation from Gene|ral St. Clair to attend him as a &s;ecretary to his expedition, which was at fir&s;t meant again&s;t Cana|da, but ended in an incur&s;ion on the coa&s;t of France. Next year, to wit, 1747, I received an invi|tation fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m the General to attend him in the &s;ame &s;tation in his mi|litary emba&s;&s;y to the courts of Vienna and Turin. I then wore the uniform of an officer, and was introduced at there courts as aid-de-camp to the general, along
<PB N="5" REF="015853_0004_0F9A2E6FCEF550B0">
with Sir Harry Er&s;kine and Cap|tain Grant, now General Grant. The&s;e two years were almo&s;t the only interruptions which my &s;tu|dies have received during the cour&s;e of my life: I pa&s;&s;ed them agreeably, and in good company; and my appointments, with my frugality, had made m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> reach a fortune, which I called indepen|dent, though mo&s;t of my friends were inclined to &s;mile when I &s;aid &s;o; in &s;hort, I was now ma&s;ter of near a thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>I had always entertained a na|tion, that my want of &s;ucce&s;s in publi&s;hing the Treati&s;e of Human Nature, had proceeded more from the manner than the matter, and that I had been guilty of a very u&s;ual indi&s;cretion, in going to the pre&s;s too early. I, therefore, ca&s;t the fir&s;t part of that work anew in the Enquiry concerning Human Under&s;tanding, which was pub|li&s;hed while I was at Turin. But this piece was at fir&s;t little more &s;ucce&s;sful than the Treati&s;e of Human Nature On my return from Italy, I had the mortificati|on to f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd all England in a fer|ment, on account <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Dr. Middle|ton's Free E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">quiry, while my perfo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mance was entirely over|looked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd neglected. A new e|dition, which had been publi&s;hed at London of my E&s;&s;ays, moral and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">litical met not with a much better reception.</P>
<P>Such is the force of na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l temper, that the&s;e di&s;appoint|ments mad little or a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> impre&s;&s;i|on on me.

Mean|while, my book&s;eller, A. Millar, informed me, that my former publications (all but the unfortu|nate Treati&s;e) were beginning to be the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation; that the &s;ale of them was gradu|ally increa&s;ing, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow e|ditions were dema<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d.

The&s;e &s;ymp|toms of a ri&s;ing reputation gav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> me encouragement, as I was ever more di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ee the favoura|ble than unfavourable &s;ide of things; a turn of mind which it is more happy to po&s;&s;e&s;s, than to be born to an e&s;tate at ten thou|&s;and a year.</P>
<P>In 1751, I removed from the country to the town, the true &s;cene for a man of letters. In 1752, were publi&s;hed at Edin|burgh, where I then lived, my Political Di&s;cour&s;es, the only work of mine that was &s;ucce&s;sful on the fir&s;t publication. It was well received abroad and at home. In the &s;ame year was publi&s;hed at London, my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals; which, in my own opinion (who ought not to judge on that &s;ubject), is of all my writings, hi&s;torical, philo&s;ophical, or literary, incom|parably the be&s;t. It came unno|ticed and unob&s;erved into the world.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="015853_0005_0F9A2E709FCB9A48">In 1752, the Faculty of Advo|cates cho&s;e me their Librarian, an office from which I received little or no emolument, but which gave me the command of a large library. I then formed the plan of writing the Hi&s;tory of Eng|land; but being frightened with the notion of continuing a narra|tive through a period of 1700 years, I commenced with the ac|ce&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of Stuart, an epoch when, I thought, the mi&s;|repre&s;entations of faction began chiefly to take place. I was, I own, &s;anguine in my expectati|ons of the &s;ucce&s;s of this work. I thought that I was the only hi&s;|torian, that had at once neglected pre&s;ent power, intere&s;t, and au|thority, and the cry of popular prejudices; and as the &s;ubject was &s;uited to every capacity, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">xpected proportional applau&s;e. But mi&s;erable was my di&s;appoint|ment: I was a&s;&s;ailed by one cry of reproach, di&s;approbation, and even dete&s;tation; Engli&s;h, Scotch, and Iri&s;h, Whig and Tory, churchman and &s;ectary, free|thinker and religioni&s;t, patriot and courtier, united in their rage again&s;t the man, who had pre|&s;umed to &s;hed a generous tear for the fate of Carles. I. and the Earl of Strafford; and after the fir&s;t ebullitions of their fury were over, what was &s;till more morti|fying, the book &s;eemed to &s;ink into oblivion. Mr. Millar told me, that in a twelvemonth he &s;old only forty-five copies of it. I &s;carc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly, indeed, heard of one man in the three kingdoms, con|&s;iderable for rank or letters, that could endure the book. I mu&s;t only except the primate of Eng|land, O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Herring, and the pri|mate of Ireland, Dr. Stone, which &s;eem two odd exceptions. The&s;e dignified prelates &s;eparate|ly &s;ent me me&s;&s;ages not to be di&s;|couraged.</P>
<P>I was, however, I confe&s;s, di&s;|couraged; and had not the war been at that time breaking out between France and England, I had certainly retired to &s;ome pro|vincial town of the former king|dom, have changed my name, and never more have returned to my native country. But as this &s;cheme was not now practicable, and the &s;ub&s;equent volume was con&s;iderably advanced, I re&s;olved to pick up courage and to per&s;e|vere.</P>
<P>In this interval, I publi&s;hed at London my Natural Hi&s;tory of Religion, along with &s;ome other &s;mall pieces: its public entry was rather ob&s;cure, except only that Dr. Hurd wrote a pamphlet a|gain&s;t it, with all the illiberal petulance, arrogance, and &s;cur|rility, which di&s;tingui&s;h the War|burtonian &s;chool. This pam|phlet gave &s;ome con&s;olation for the otherwi&s;e indifferent recepti|on of my performance.</P>
<P>In 1756, two years after the fall of the fir&s;t volume, was pub|li&s;hed the &s;econd volume of my Hi&s;tory, containing the period from the death of Charles I. till the Revolution. This perform|ance happened to give le&s;s di&s;|plea&s;ure to the Whigs, and was better received. It not only ro&s;e it&s;elf, but helped to buoy up its unfortunate brother.</P>
<P>But though I had been taught by experience, that the Whig party were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of bellow|ing all places, both in the &s;tate and in literature, I was &s;o little inclined to yield to their &s;en&s;ele&s;s clamour, that in above a hundred
<PB N="7" REF="015853_0006_0F9A2E7150A44CB8">
alterations, which farther &s;tudy, reading, or reflection engaged me to make in the reigns of the two fir&s;t Stuarts, I have made all of them invariably to the Tory &s;ide. It is ridiculous to con&s;ider the Engli&s;h con&s;titution before that period as a regular plan of li|berty.</P>
<P>In 1759, I publi&s;hed my Hi&s;|tory of the Hou&s;e of Tudor. The clamour again&s;t this performance was almo&s;t equal to that again&s;t the Hi&s;tory of the two fir&s;t Stu|arts. The reign of Elizabeth was particularly obnoxious. But I was now callous again&s;t the im|pre&s;&s;ions of public folly, and con|tinued very peaceably and con|tentedly in my retreat at Edin|burgh, to fini&s;h, in two volumes, the more early part of the Engli&s;h Hi&s;tory, which I gave to the public in 1761, with tolerable, and but tolerable &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding this va|riety of winds and &s;ea&s;ons, to which my writings had been ex|po&s;ed, they had &s;till been making &s;uch advances, that the copy-money given me by the book&s;el|lers, much exceeded any thing formerly known in England; I was become not only indepen|dent, but opulent. I retired to my native country of Scotland, determined never more to &s;et my foot out of it; and retaining the &s;atisfaction of never having pre|ferred a reque&s;t to one great man, or even making advances of friend&s;hip to any of them. As I was now turned of fifty, I thought of pa&s;&s;ing all the re&s;t of my life in this philo&s;ophical manner, when I received, in 1763, an invitation from the Earl of Hertford, with whom I was not in the lea&s;t ac|quainted, to attend him on his emba&s;&s;y to Paris, with a near pro&s;pect of being appointed &s;ecre|tary to the emba&s;&s;y; and, in the meanwhile, of performing the functions of that office. This offer, however inviting, I at fir&s;t declined, both becau&s;e I was re|luctant to begin connexions with the great, and becau&s;e I was a|fraid that the civilities and gay company of Paris, would prove di&s;agreeable to a per&s;on of my age and humour: but on his lord&s;hip's repeating the invitation, I ac|cepted of it. I have every rea&s;on, both of plea&s;ure and intere&s;t, to think my&s;elf happy in my con|nexions with that nobleman, as well as afterwards with his bro|ther, General Conway.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have not &s;een the &s;trange effects of modes, will ne|ver imagine the reception I met with at Paris, from men and wo|men of all ranks and &s;tations. The more I re&s;iled from their ex|ce&s;&s;ive civilities, the more I was loaded with them. There is, however, a real &s;atisfaction in living at Paris, from the great number of &s;en&s;ible, knowing, and polite company with which that city abounds above all places in the univer&s;e. I thought once of &s;ettling there for life.</P>
<P>I was appointed &s;ecretary to the emba&s;&s;y; and in &s;ummer 1765, Lord Hertford left me, being ap|pointed Lord Lieutenant of Ire|land. I was <HI>charge d' affaires</HI> till the arrival of the Duke of Rich|mond, towards the end of the year, In the beginning of 1766, I left Paris, and next &s;ummer went to Edinburgh, with the &s;ame view as formerly, of bury|ing my&s;elf in a philo&s;ophical re|treat. I returned to that place, not richer, but with much more
<PB N="8" REF="015853_0007_0F9A2E721276F1A8">
money, and a much larger in|come, by mean's of Lord Hert|ford's friend&s;hip, than I left it; and I was de&s;irous of trying what &s;uperfluity could produce, as I had fomerly made an experiment of a competency. But, in 1767, I received from Mr Conway an invitation to be Under-&s;ecretary; and this invitation, both the cha|racter of the per&s;on, and my con|nexions with Lord Hertford, pre|vented me from declining. I re|turned to Edinburgh in 1769, ve|ry opulent (for I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a reve|nue of 1060l. a year), healthy, and though &s;omewhat &s;tricken in years, with the pro&s;pect of en|joying long my ea&s;e, and of &s;ee|ing the increa&s;e of my reputation.</P>
<P>In &s;pring 1775, I was &s;truck with a di&s;order in my bowels, which at fir&s;t gave me no alarm, but has &s;ince, as I apprehend it, become mortal and incurable. I now reckon upon a &s;peedy di&s;&s;o|lution. I have &s;uffered very little pain from my di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rder; and what is more &s;trange, have, notwith|&s;tanding the great decline of my per&s;on, never &s;uffered a moment's abatement of my &s;pirits; in&s;o|much, that were I to name the period of my life, which I &s;hould mo&s;t choo&s;e to pa&s;s over again, I might be tempted to point to this later period. I po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame ardour as ever in &s;tudy, and the &s;ame gaiety in company. I con|&s;ider, be&s;ides, that a man of &s;ixty five, by dying, cuts off only a few years of infirmities; and though I &s;ee many &s;ymptoms of my literary reputation's breaking out at la&s;t with additional lu&s;tre, I knew that I could have but very few years to enjoy it. It is diffi|cult to be more detached from life than I am at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>To conclude hi&s;torically with my own character. I am, or ra|ther was (for that is the &s;tyle I mu&s;t now u&s;e in &s;peaking of my|&s;elf which embordens me the more to &s;peak my &s;entiments); I was, I &s;ay, a man of mild di&s;po|&s;itions, of command of temper, of an open, &s;ocial, and cheerful humour, capable of attachment, but little &s;u&s;ceptible of enmity, and of great moderation in all my pa&s;&s;ions. Even my love of literary fame, my ruling pa&s;&s;ion, never &s;oured my temper, not|with&s;tanding my frequent di&s;ap|pointments. My company was not unacceptable to the young and carele&s;s, as well as to the &s;tudious and literary; and as I took a particular plea&s;ure in the company of mode&s;t women, I had no rea&s;on to be di&s;plea&s;ed with the reception I met with from them. In a word, though mo&s;t men any wi&s;e eminent, have found rea&s;on to complain of ca|lumny, I never was touched, or even attacked by her baleful tooth: and though I wantonly expo&s;ed my&s;elf to the rage of both civil and religious factions, they &s;eemed to be di&s;armed in my behalf of their wonted fury. My friends never had occa&s;ion to vin|dicate any one circum&s;tance of my character and conduct: not but that the zealots, we may well &s;uppo&s;e, would have been glad to invent and propagate any &s;tory to my di&s;advantage but they could never find any which they thought would wear the face of probabili|ty. I cannot &s;ay there is no va|nity in making this funeral ora|tion of my&s;elf, but I hope it is not a mi&s;placed one; and this is a matter of fact which is ea&s;ily cleared and a&s;certained.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER FROM ADAM SMITH, LL. D. TO WILLIAM STRAHAN, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Giving &s;ome Account of Mr. HUME, during his la&s;t Sickne&s;s.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Kirkaldy, Fife&s;hire, <DATE>Nov. 9, 1776.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with a real, though a ve|ry melancholy plea&s;ure, that I &s;it down to give you &s;ome ac|count of the behaviour of our late excellent friend, Mr. Hume, during his la&s;t illne&s;s.</P>
<P>Though, in his own judgment, his di&s;ea&s;e was mortal and incur|able, yet he allow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d him&s;elf to be prevailed upon, by the entreaty of his friends, to try what might be the effects of a long journey. A few days before he &s;et out, he wrote that account of his own life, which, together with his o|ther papers, he has left to your care. My account, therefore, &s;hall begin where his ends.</P>
<P>He &s;et out for London towards the end of April, and at Mor|peth met with Mr. John Home and my&s;elf, who had both come down from London on purpo&s;e to &s;ee him, expecting to have found him at Edinburgh. Mr. Home returned with him, and attended him during the whole of his &s;tay in England, with that care and attention which might be expect|ed from a temper &s;o perfectly friendly and affectionate. As I had written to my mother that &s;he might expect me in Scotland, I was under the nece&s;&s;ity of con|tinuing my journey. His di&s;ea&s;e &s;eemed to yield to exerci&s;e and change of air, and when he ar|rived in London, he was appa|rently in much better health than when he left Edinburgh. He was advi&s;ed to go to Bath to drink the waters, which appeared for &s;ome time to have &s;o good an ef|fect upon him, that even he him|&s;elf began to entertain, what he was not apt to do, a better opini|on of his own health. His &s;ymp|toms, however, &s;oon returned with their u&s;ual violence, and from that moment he gave up all thoughts of recovery, but &s;ub|mitted with the utmo&s;t cheerful|ne&s;s, and the mo&s;t perfect com|placency and re&s;ignation. Upon his return to Edinburgh, though he found him&s;elf much weaker, yet his cheerfulne&s;s never abated, and he continued to divert him|&s;elf, as u&s;ual, with correcting his own works for a new edition, with reading books of amu&s;e|ment, with the conver&s;ation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="10" REF="015853_0009_0F9A2E73A83FA660">
his friends; and, &s;ometimes in the evening, with a party at his favourite game of whi&s;t. His cheerfulne&s;s was &s;o great, and his conver&s;ation and amu&s;ements run &s;o much in their u&s;ual &s;train, that, notwith&s;tanding all bad &s;ymptoms, many people could not believe he was dying. <Q>I &s;hall tell your friend, Colonel Edmond&s;tone,</Q> &s;aid Doctor Dundas to him one day, <Q>that I left you much better, and in a fair way of recovery.</Q>&mdash; "Doctor," &s;aid he, <Q>as I be|lieve you would not chu&s;e to tell any thing but the truth, you had better tell him, that I am dying as fa&s;t as my ene|mies, if I have any, could wi&s;h, and as ea&s;ily and cheer|fully as my be&s;t friends could de&s;ire.</Q> Colonel Edmond|&s;tone &s;oon afterwards came to &s;ee him, and take leave of him; and on his way home, he could not forbear writing him a letter bid|ding him once more an eternal adieu, and applying to him, as to a dying man, the beautiful French ver&s;es in which the Abb&eacute; Chaulieu, in expectation of his own death, laments his approach|ing &s;eparation from his friend, the Marquis de la Fare, Mr. Hume's magnanimity and firm|ne&s;s were &s;uch, that his mo&s;t af|fectionate friends knew, that they hazarded nothing in talking or writing to him as to a dying man, and that &s;o far from being hurt by this frankne&s;s, he was rather plea&s;ed and flattered by it. I happened to come into his room while he was reading this letter, which he had ju&s;t received, and which he immediately &s;howed me. I told him, that though I was &s;en&s;ible how very much be was weakened, and that appear|ances were in many re&s;pects very bad, yet his cheerfulne&s;s was &s;till &s;o great, the &s;pirit of life &s;eemed &s;till to be &s;o very &s;trong in him, that I could not help entertaining &s;ome faint hopes. He an&s;wered, <Q>Your hopes are groundle&s;s. An habitual diarrhoea of more than a year's &s;tanding, would be a very bad di&s;ea&s;e at any age: at my age it is a mortal one. When I lie down in the evening. I feel my&s;elf weaker than when I ro&s;e in the morn|ing; and when I ri&s;e in the morning, weaker than when I lay down in the evening. I am &s;en&s;ible, be&s;ides, that &s;ome of my vital parts are affected, &s;o that I mu&s;t &s;oon die.</Q>&mdash; "Well," &s;aid I, "if it mu&s;t be &s;o, you have at lea&s;t the &s;atis|faction of leaving all your friends, your brother's family in particu|lar, in great pro&s;perity." He &s;aid, that he felt that &s;atisfaction &s;o &s;en&s;ibly, that when he was reading a few days before, Lu|cian's Dialogues of the Dead, among all the excu&s;es which are alledged to Charon for not enter|ing readily into his boat, he could not find one that fitted him; he had no hou&s;e to fini&s;h, he had no daughter to provide for, he had no enemies upon whom he wi&s;hed to revenge him&s;elf. <Q>I could not well imagine, &s;aid he, what excu&s;e I could make to Charon in order to obtain a little delay. I have done eve|ry thing of con&s;equence which I ever meant to do, and I could at no time expect to leave my relations and friends in a better &s;ituation than that in which I am now likely to leave them; I, therefore, have
<PB N="11" REF="015853_0010_0F9A2E746D5750A8">
all rea&s;on to die contented.</Q> He then diverted him&s;elf with inventing &s;everal jocular excu&s;es, which he &s;uppo&s;ed he might make to Charon, and with imagining the very &s;urly an&s;wers which it might &s;uit the character of Cha|ron to return to them. <Q>Upon further con&s;ideration, &s;aid he, I thought I might &s;ay to him, Good Charon, I have been correcting my works for a new edition. Allow me a little time, that I may &s;ee how the Public receives the altera|tions.</Q> But Charon would an&s;wer, <Q>When you have &s;een the effect of the&s;e, you will be for making other alterations. There will be no end of &s;uch excu&s;es; &s;o, hone&s;t friend, plea&s;e &s;tep into the boat.</Q> But I might &s;till urge, <Q>Have a little patience, good Charon, I have been endeavouring to open the eyes of the public. If I live a few years longer, I may have the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing the downfal of &s;ome of the prevail|ing &s;y&s;tems of &s;uper&s;tition.</Q> But Charon would then lo&s;e all temper and decency. <Q>You loitering rogue, that will not happen the&s;e many hundred years. Do you fancy I will grant you a lea&s;e for &s;o long a term? Get into the boat this in&s;tant, you lazy loitering rogue.</Q></P>
<P>But, though Mr. Hume always talked of his approaching di&s;&s;olu|tion with great cheerfulne&s;s, he never affected to make any parade of his magnanimity. He never mentioned the &s;ubject but when the conver&s;ation naturally led to it, and never dwelt longer upon it than the cour&s;e of the conver|&s;ation happened to require: it was a &s;ubject indeed which oc|curred pretty frequently, in con|&s;equence of the inquiries which his friends, who came to &s;ee him, naturally made concerning the &s;tate of his health. The conver|&s;ation which I mentioned above, and which pa&s;&s;ed on Thur&s;day the 8th of Augu&s;t, was the la&s;t, except one, that I ever had with him. He had now become &s;o very weak, that the company of his mo&s;t intimate friends fatigued him; for his cheerfulne&s;s was &s;till &s;o great, his complai&s;ance and &s;ocial di&s;po&s;ition were &s;till &s;o entire, that when any friend was with him, he could not help talk|ing more, and with greater ex|ertion, than &s;uited the weakne&s;s of his body. At his own de&s;ire, therefore, I agreed to leave Edin|burgh, where I was &s;taying part|ly upon his account, and return|ed to my mother's hou&s;e here, at Kirkaldy, upon condition that he would &s;end for me whenever he wi&s;hed to &s;ee me; the phy&s;ici|an who &s;aw him mo&s;t frequently, Doctor Black, undertaking, in the mean time, to write me occa|&s;ionally an account of the &s;tate of his health.</P>
<P>On the 22d of Augu&s;t, the Doctor wrote me the following letter:</P>
<P>"Since my la&s;t, Mr. Hume has pa&s;&s;ed his time pretty ea&s;ily, but is much weaker. He &s;its up, goes down &s;tairs once a day, and amu&s;es him&s;elf with reading, but &s;eldom &s;ees any body. He finds that even the conver&s;ation of his mo&s;t intimate friends fatigues and oppre&s;&s;es him; and it is happy that he does not need it, for he is quite free from anxiety, impati|ence, or low &s;pirits, and pa&s;&s;es his time very well with the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of amu&s;ing books."</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Ye&s;terday about four o'clock afternoon, Mr. Hume expired. The near approach of his death became evident in the night be|tween Thur&s;day and Friday, when his di&s;ea&s;e became exce&s;|&s;ive, and &s;oon weakened him &s;o much, that he could no longer ri&s;e out of his bed. He conti|nued to the la&s;t perfectly &s;en&s;ible, and free from much pain or feel|ings of di&s;tre&s;s. He never drop|ped the &s;malle&s;t expre&s;&s;ion of im|patience; but when he had occa|&s;ion to &s;peak to the people about him, always did it with affection and tenderne&s;s. I thought it im|proper to write to bring you over, e&s;pecially as I heard that he had dictated a letter to you de&s;iring you not to come. When he be|came very weak it co&s;t him an ef|fort to &s;peak, and he died in &s;uch a happy compo&s;ure of mind, that nothing could exceed it.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Thus died our mo&s;t excellent, and never to be forgotten friend; concerning who&s;e philo&s;ophical opinions men will, no doubt, judge variou&s;ly, every one ap|proving, or condemning them, according as they happen to co|incide or di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gree with his own; but concerning who&s;e character and conduct there can &s;carce be a difference of opinion. His tem|per, indeed, &s;eemed to be more happily balanced, if I may be al|lowed &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion, than that perhaps of any other man I have ever known. Even in the lowe&s;t &s;tate of his fortune, his great and nece&s;&s;ary frugality ne|ver hindered him from exerci&s;ing upon p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oper occa&s;ions, acts both of charity and genero&s;ity. It was a frugality founded, not up|on avarice, but upon the love of independency. The extreme gen|tlene&s;s of his nature never weak|ened either the firmne&s;s of his hand, or the &s;teadine&s;s of his re|&s;olutions. His con&s;tant plea&s;ant|ry was the genuine effu&s;ion of good-nature and good-humour, tempered with delicacy and mo|de&s;ty, and without even the &s;lighte&s;t tincture of malignity, &s;o frequently the di&s;agreeable &s;ource of what is called wit in other men. it never was the meaning of his raillery to mortify; and therefore, far from offending, it &s;eldom &s;ailed to plea&s;e and de|light, even tho&s;e who were the
<PB N="13" REF="015853_0012_0F9A2E75CFC352F8">
objects of it, To his friends, who were frequently the objects of it, there was not perhaps any one of all his great and amiable quali|ties, which contributed more to endear his conver&s;ation. And that gaiety of temper, &s;o agreea|ble in &s;ociety, but which is &s;o of|ten accompanied with frivolous and &s;uperficial qualities, was in him certainly attended with the mo&s;t &s;evere application, the mo&s;t exten&s;ive learning, the greate&s;t depth of thought, and a capacity in every re&s;pect the mo&s;t compre|hen&s;ive. Upon the whole, I have always con&s;idered him, both in his life-time and &s;ince his death, as approaching as nearly to the idea of a perfectly wi&s;e and virtuous man; as perhaps the na|ture of human frailty will permit.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>LES VOYAGES D'UN PHILO|SOPHE of M. le Poivre have been much admired in France. They were originally read before the Royal Society of Agriculture at Lyons, of which he was pre&s;i|dent, and afterwards before the Royal Society of Paris. For &s;ometime they were handed about in manu&s;cript, and at length, found their way to the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>M. le Poivre's manner is ea&s;y and elegant; his ob&s;ervations &s;triking and judicious; his &s;enti|ments humane and benevolent.&mdash; The genuine happine&s;s of every nation mu&s;t depend on agricul|ture, and agriculture mu&s;t ever be influenced by e&s;tabli&s;hed laws and modes of government: na|ture indulgently &s;miles on the labour of a free-born people, but &s;hrinks with horror from the ty|rant and the &s;lave. This is his &s;y&s;tem, and it is the &s;y&s;tem of truth, founded on experience, and &s;upported not only by com|paring cotemporary nations, but by contra&s;ting nations with them|&s;elves at different periods.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary the reader &s;hould keep in view the country of the author, as many of his &s;trictures on European agriculture, though unapplicable perhaps to Britain, convey a de&s;criptive picture of the &s;tate of cultivation in France.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY people, however bar|barous, have arts peculiar to them&s;elves. The diver&s;ity of cli|mates, whil&s;t it varies the wants of mankind, offers to their indu&s;|try different productions on which to exerci&s;e it. Every country, at a certain degree of di&s;tance, has fabrics &s;o &s;ingularly peculiar to it&s;elf, that they could not have been the fabrics of other regions: but agriculture, in every climate, is the univer&s;al art of mankind: from one extreme of the globe to the other, nations &s;till barbarous, as well as tho&s;e who&s;e ideas are civilized, procure to them&s;elves, at lea&s;t, a part of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by the culture of their fields; yet this art, however univer&s;al, is not every where equally flouri&s;h|ing.</P>
<P>It never fails to pro&s;per among wi&s;e nations, who know how to honour and encourage it;&mdash;it &s;upports it&s;elf but feebly among&s;t a people half poli&s;hed, who ei|ther prefer to it frivolous arts, or who, being &s;ufficiently enlight|ened perhaps to perceive its uti|lity, are &s;till too much &s;laves to the prejudices of their ancient barbarity, to affranchize and confer honours on tho&s;e who ex|erci&s;e it;&mdash;it langui&s;hes, and its influence is &s;carcely to be ob|&s;erved among&s;t barbarians, who de&s;pi&s;e it.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of agriculture has e|ver been the principal object of my re&s;earches among the various people I have &s;een in the cour&s;e of my voyages. It is almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible for a traveller, who per|haps only pa&s;&s;es through a coun|try, to make &s;uch remarks as are nece&s;&s;ary to convey a ju&s;t idea of the government, police, and man|ners
<PB N="18" REF="015853_0015_0F9A2E781183C7A8">
of the inhabitants. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, the criterion which be&s;t marks the internal &s;tate of a na|tion, is to ob&s;erve the public markets, and the face of the country. If the markets abound in provi&s;ions, if the fields are well cultivated, and covered with rich crops, then in general you may conclude that the country is well peopled, that the inhabitants are civilized and happy, that their manners are poli&s;hed, and their government agreeable to the prin|ciples of rea&s;on. &mdash; You may then &s;ay to your&s;elf, I am among&s;t <HI>Men.</HI></P>
<P>When, on the contrary, I have arrived among&s;t a people, whom it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;earch for a|mid&s;t fore&s;ts, who&s;e neglected lands were overgrown with bram|bles; when I have traver&s;ed large tracts of uncultivated de&s;arts, and then at la&s;t &s;tumbled on a grub|bed up wretchedly cultivated field; when arrived at length at &s;ome canton, I have ob&s;erved nothing in the public market but a few &s;orry roots, I no longer he&s;itated to determine the inhabitants to be wretched &s;avages, or groaning under the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive &s;lavery.</P>
<P>I never remember a &s;ingle in|&s;tance of being obliged to retract this fir&s;t idea, conceived &s;imply by in&s;pecting the &s;tate of agricul|ture among&s;t the various nations I have &s;een: the knowledge of various particulars, which a long re&s;idence among many of them has enabled me to acquire, has ever confirmed me in opinion, that a country poorly cultivated is always inhabited by men bar|barous or oppre&s;&s;ed, and that population there can never be con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>You will ob&s;erve by the detail I now offer you of my enquiries, that in every country agriculture depends ab&s;olutely on the laws, the manners, and even on the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed prejudices of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> re&s;pec|tive inhabitants.

<HEAD>Of the We&s;tern Coa&s;ts of <HI>AFRICA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE i&s;lands and we&s;tern di&s;tricts of this part of the world which I have &s;een, are for the greater part uncultivated lands, inhabited by unhappy ne|groes. The&s;e wretched men, who have &s;o poor an e&s;timation of them&s;elves as to &s;ell one another, never employ a thought on the cultivation of their lands. Satis|fied to exi&s;t from day to day, un|der a climate where their wants are few, they cultivate ju&s;t as much as prevents their dying of hunger; they carele&s;ly &s;ow every year &s;ome maize, a very little rice; and plant, in &s;mall quanti|ties, different kinds of potatoes, not of the nature of ours, though the culture is much the &s;ame; we know them by the name of <HI>yams.</HI> In general their harve&s;ts are &s;o poor, that the Europeans, who re&s;ort to them for the purcha&s;e of &s;laves, are obliged to bring from Europe or America the provi&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary for the maintenance of tho&s;e unfortunate creatures doom|ed to compo&s;e their cargoes.</P>
<P>The negroes, who inhabit the environs of the European colonies, give &s;omewhat more attention to agriculture than the others.&mdash; They rear flocks; they cultivate rice in greater quantities; and in their gardens are found pul&s;e, of which the &s;eed has been brought from Europe; yet all they know of agriculture, they have learnt from the Europeans &s;ettled a|mong&s;t them; their own experi|ence is extremely bounded; and I have never been able to di&s;cover in their indu&s;try any proce&s;s which could in the lea&s;t improve our own.</P>
<P>From the river of Angola to Cape Negroe, and from thence till you approach the Cape of Good Hope, nothing is to be &s;een but &s;terile uncultivated lands; the coa&s;ts are naked and covered with barren &s;ands; and you are under the nece&s;&s;ity of travelling many leagues before you can di&s;|cover a palm-tree, or the &s;lighte&s;t verdure. The country and its few inhabitants &s;eem to be &s;truck with one common cur&s;e. From the informations I have received touching the&s;e countries from the Italian mi&s;&s;ionaries, who with an admirable zeal have penetrated into the heart of the&s;e accur&s;ed regions, I learn likewi&s;e that a|griculture is ju&s;t as languid in the
<PB N="20" REF="015853_0017_0F9A2E798FBF8A38">
interior parts as upon the coa&s;ts, although, in many places, the &s;oil appeared much more fruitful from its natural productions.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="description of area">
<HEAD>The <HI>CAPE</HI> of <HI>GOOD HOPE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE countries around the Cape were condemned to the &s;ame &s;terility before the Dutch took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them; but &s;ince their e&s;tabli&s;hment on this point of Africa, the lands produce in abundance wheat and grain of every kind, wines of different qualities, and a con&s;iderable quan|tity of excellent fruits, collected from every quarter of the world. There you &s;ee exten&s;ive pa&s;tures covered with hor&s;es, black cattle, and &s;heep&mdash;the&s;e herds and flocks thrive exceedingly well. The abundance which this colony en|joys, compared to the barrenne&s;s of the &s;urrounding countries, e|vidently demon&s;trates that the earth denies her favours only to the tyrant and the &s;lave; but be|comes prodigal of her trea&s;ures, beyond the mo&s;t &s;anguine hope, &s;o &s;oon as &s;he is free, and culti|vated by men of di&s;cernment, whom wi&s;e and invariable laws protect.</P>
<P>A number of Frenchmen, forced from their country by the revocation of the edict of Nantz, have on this coa&s;t found a new e&s;tabli&s;hment, and, with it &s;ecu|rity, property, and liberty, the only true encouragers of agricul|ture, the only principles of abun|dance. They have enriched this adopted mother by their indu&s;try; they have there founded con&s;ider|able colonies, &s;ome of which bear the name of that unhappy coun|try which denied them the u&s;e of water and of fire, the remem|brance of which however they &s;till fondly cheri&s;h.</P>
<P>The colony of the Little Ro|chelle &s;urpa&s;&s;es all the re&s;t, by the indu&s;try of the coloni&s;ts, and the fertility of the lands which belong to it. The pa&s;tures are there compo&s;ed of a variety of gra&s;&s;es, natives of the country, together with &s;everal different &s;pecies of herbage, which com|po&s;e our artificial meadows in Europe, &s;uch as trefoil, lucerne, and &s;aintfoin. The exotic plants, the &s;eeds of which have been im|ported by the Dutch, flouri&s;h there as the natural productions of the country. Tho&s;e &s;eeds are &s;own by an operation of the plough; they cut the gra&s;s only the fir&s;t year; the &s;econd they o|pen the meadows to cattle, which live there at di&s;cretion, without any other attention than that of collecting them together every evening into a park inclo&s;ed with &s;trong and high palli&s;ades, to &s;e|cure them again&s;t the lions and tigers, with which this country abounds.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e enclo&s;ures are watered only by the rains, altho' they generally endeavour to chu&s;e them in the neighbourhood of &s;ome brook, where they dig com|modious watering places. In all the&s;e pa&s;turages, they have an eye to groves of trees, where the herds and flocks may find &s;helter again&s;t the inten&s;e heat of the &s;un; particularly in January, February, and March, which in this part of the world are the mo&s;t &s;ultry months in the year.</P>
<P>The arable land is here labour|ed as in Europe, &s;ometimes by
<PB N="21" REF="015853_0018_0F9A2E7A4EE86800">
hor&s;es, but oftener by oxen: the Dutch of this colony have by their indu&s;try corrected the natu|ral &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s of the&s;e latter a|nimals, by exerci&s;ing them while young in a bri&s;k pace; in con&s;e|quence of which I have &s;een, at the Cape, carriages, drawn by teams of ten or a dozen yoke of oxen, go as expeditiou&s;ly as if drawn by hor&s;es.</P>
<P>The grains commonly &s;own at the Cape, are wheat, turkey corn, and rice; the&s;e generally produce an increa&s;e of fifty-fold. They cultivate a variety of different kinds of pul&s;e, &s;uch as pea&s;e, common beans, and French beans. This pul&s;e makes a refre&s;hing provi&s;ion to the &s;hips touching at the Cape going or returning to India.</P>
<P>A particular &s;pecies of this pul&s;e is much in reque&s;t in India, to which they export a con&s;ider|able quantity: it is there known by the name of <HI>Cape Pea&s;e:</HI> it is a kind of French bean which re|quires no prop; its grain is of the form of that bean, but larger and flatter; it ta&s;tes like our green pea&s;e, and pre&s;erves its fre&s;hne&s;s for a long time. I have this year attempted the culture of this plant, which promi&s;es &s;ucce&s;s. The cli|mate at the Cape &s;eems to demand from the cultivator an attention which appears not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in this country, and which would even perhaps be prejudicial to the productions of our lands.</P>
<P>The Cape however is expo&s;ed the greate&s;t part of the year to vi|olent hurricanes, which blow ge|nerally from the north-ea&s;t.&mdash; The&s;e winds are &s;o impetuous that they would beat down the fruits from the trees, and &s;weep to de&s;truction the labours of the farmer, had they not provided a barrier for the &s;ecurity of the har|ve&s;t. The Dutch coloni&s;ts have divided their lands into &s;mall fields, which they have &s;urround|ed with high palli&s;ades of oak and other trees, planted very clo&s;e to one another, &s;omewhat re&s;em|bling a charmille, de&s;igned for the ornament of a garden. The&s;e palli&s;ades th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">out every year, as they gro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; their height being commonly from twenty-five to thirty feet; every &s;eparate field, in con&s;equence, is enclo&s;ed like a chamber.</P>
<P>It is by this indu&s;try alone that the Dutch have rendered this co|lony not only the granary of all their &s;ettlements in the Ea&s;t-In|dies, but the mo&s;t commodious place for ve&s;&s;els to touch at for refre&s;hments and provi&s;ions of all kinds.</P>
<P>When the Dutch began to form their vineyards, they endeavoured to procure plants from tho&s;e can|tons which enjoyed the greate&s;t reputation for their vines; but after many fruitle&s;s attempts to produce, at the extremity of A|frica, the wines of Burgundy and Champagne, they applied to rear|ing the plants tran&s;ported from Spain, the Canaries, and the Le|vant, where the climate is more analogous to the Cape. At pre|&s;ent, the plants which are culti|vated mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sfully, are tho&s;e of the Mu&s;cadel kind: the red Mu&s;cadel particularly, which they rear in a &s;mall di&s;trict called Con|&s;tance, produces mo&s;t delicious wine; the Dutch Ea&s;t-India Com|pany always &s;ecure this vintage, which they &s;end in pre&s;ents to the &s;overeigns of Europe.</P>
<P>The wines at the Cape are cul|tivated without vine-props; the
<PB N="22" REF="015853_0019_0F9A2E7B14E12760">
method of labour is much the &s;ame with that in France. The vineyards are &s;urrounded by a number of trees, upon which they entwine the &s;lips of the great Spani&s;h Mu&s;cadine, in form of e&s;pa&s;iers, very high, by which the vines are &s;heltered from the violence of the winds.</P>
<P>The &s;ame attention, at the Cape, is paid to gardening, as to the other branches of agriculture. You there find all the variety of European pul&s;e, greens, herbs, and roots, with the be&s;t of tho&s;e peculiar to other parts of the world. Independent of the gar|dens of the coloni&s;ts, which are kept in as fine order as any in Europe, the India Company have cultivated two or three gar|dens, exten&s;ive and magnificent, which they &s;upport with an ex|pence worthy of a &s;overeign com|pany.</P>
<P>Fifteen or twenty European gardeners, who&s;e abilities are ap|proved before they are embarked, are employed in the cultivation of each of tho&s;e va&s;t gardens, un|der the direction of a principal gardener, who&s;e place is lucrative and honourable. It is in tho&s;e gardens, at the expence of the company, that all the experi|ments are made in every new &s;pecies of culture; and it is there that every private individual is provided, gratis, with &s;uch plants and &s;eeds as he may have occa&s;i|on for, together with the nece&s;|&s;ary in&s;tructions for their cultiva|tion. The&s;e gardens furni&s;h, in the greate&s;t abundance, herbage and fruits of various kinds to the company's &s;hips.</P>
<P>Travellers cannot but with plea&s;ure and admiration ob&s;erve large enclo&s;ures con&s;ecrated to the &s;tudy and improvement of botany, in which the mo&s;t rare and u&s;eful plants, from every quarter of the world, are arrang|ed in the mo&s;t excellent order: the curious have the additional &s;atisfaction al&s;o of finding &s;kilful gardeners, who take plea&s;ure in de&s;cribing and pointing out their virtues.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e beautiful gardens are terminated by large orchards, where are to be found all the fruits of Europe, together with &s;everal natives of Africa and A|&s;ia. Nothing is more agreeable than to &s;ee in different expo&s;iti|ons, even in the &s;ame enclo&s;ure, the che&s;nut, the apple, and other trees, from the mo&s;t northern cli|mates, together with the mu&s;ca|dine of the Indies, the camphres of Borneo, the palms, and a va|riety of other trees, which are natives of the torrid zone.</P>

<P>AFTER doubling the Cape of Good Hope, you enter the Indian &s;ea, where you find the great i&s;land of Madaga&s;car: we are &s;till unacquainted with many places of this i&s;land, though the Portugue&s;e, Dutch, French, and other Europeans have had &s;ettlements, and frequented it, above two centuries. Tho&s;e parts, which we know, are very fertile, and the inhabitants would, in all probability, c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tivate them ex|tremely well, were there a vent for their productions. They rear numerous herds of cattle and &s;heep; their pa&s;turages, &s;uch as nature has formed them, are rich:
<PB N="23" REF="015853_0020_0F9A2E7C8F99ED50">
in many cantons are large tracts of tilled ground, covered with gra&s;s of an extraordinary &s;ize, which grows to the height of five or &s;ix feet; the natives call it <HI>Fatak</HI>; it is excellent for nouri&s;hing and fattening their horned cattle, which are of the large&s;t &s;pecies, and differ in &s;hape from ours, par|ticularly by a large fle&s;hy protu|berance on their neck &mdash;Another gra&s;s, of a finer blade, &s;hoots &s;pontaneou&s;ly through the &s;ands on the &s;ea coa&s;t, which furni&s;hes food for the &s;heep: the&s;e are of the &s;ame &s;pecies with tho&s;e of Barbary, and differ from ours mo&s;t remarkably, by the mon|&s;trous &s;ize of their tails, which weigh in general from &s;ix to eight pounds.</P>
<P>The Madeca&s;&s;es or Malegaches (which is the name of the inhabi|tants of this i&s;land) cultivate &s;carce any other grain but rice: they &s;ow at the commencement of the rainy &s;ea&s;on; in con&s;equence of which they are not under the nece&s;&s;ity of watering their fields. In labouring their ground, they u&s;e no in&s;trument but the pick|axe; they begin by grubbing up all the weeds; then five or &s;ix men, ranging them&s;elves in a line on the field, dig little holes as they pa&s;s along, into which the women or children, who follow, throw the grains of the rice, and then with their feet cover them with earth: a field &s;own in this manner, produces an increa&s;e of above eighty or a hundred-fold, which proves rather the extreme fertility of the &s;oil, than the goodne&s;s of the cultivation: bad|ly under&s;tood as it may be, how|ever, the inhabitants of Mada|ga&s;car live in abundance. In no country in the world, that I have &s;een, are rice and other e&s;&s;ential provi&s;ions cheaper than in this i&s;land. For a remnant of coar&s;e blue cloath, which may be worth perhaps twenty pence, the Made|ca&s;&s;e gives two or three mea&s;ures of rice. The&s;e mea&s;ures are fur|ni&s;hed by the Europeans, who never fail to enlarge them every year; yet the i&s;landers do not complain. The mea&s;ure is fir&s;t of all heaped; the buyer then, in virtue of an e&s;tabli&s;hed right for &s;ecuring good mea&s;ure, thru&s;ts his arm to the elbow in the rice, and with one &s;weep empties it al|mo&s;t entirely, which the Made|ca&s;&s;e has the patience a &s;econd time to repleni&s;h, without a mur|mur.

<P>There cannot be a doubt, but if our India Company,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French India Company.</NOTE> who a|lone are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the trade with the natives of this i&s;land, would give proper encourage|ment to agriculture, it would in a &s;hort time make a rapid pro|gre&s;s.&mdash;Our i&s;lands of Bourbon and France would here always find a certain re&s;ource again&s;t tho&s;e dearths which too frequent|ly di&s;tre&s;s the latter of tho&s;e i&s;lands.

<HEAD>The <HI>ISLE</HI> of <HI>BOURBON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALMOST 200 leagues ea&s;t of Madaga&s;car, lie the two i&s;lands of Bourbon and France; the &s;oil of which is naturally as fertile as that of Madaga&s;car, whil&s;t they enjoy a happier cli|mate. Bourbon has no port; it is of con&s;equence little frequent|ed by the &s;hipping. The inha|bitants have pre&s;erved their &s;im|plicity of manners, and agricul|ture is there in a flouri&s;hing &s;tate. The i&s;land produces wheat, rice, and maize, not only for its own con&s;umpt, but even furni&s;hes a &s;mall &s;upply to the I&s;le of France: the culture there is the &s;ame as at Madaga&s;car. The horned cattle and &s;heep, which they have im|ported from that i&s;land, thrive here extremely well, e&s;pecially as they have al&s;o introduced the gra&s;s called <HI>Fatak,</HI> which, as I have before ob&s;erved, makes ex|cellent pa&s;turage.</P>
<P>The lands of this i&s;land are principally employed in the cul|ture of the coffee-tree. The fir&s;t plants of this &s;hrubby tree were brought from Mocha. It multi|plies by its grains &s;owing &s;ponta|neou&s;ly; little attention is re|quired; nothing more is nece&s;&s;a|ry than to grub up, three or four times during the fir&s;t year, the neighbouring weeds, which would otherwi&s;e rob it of its proper nou|ri&s;hment: the &s;econd year it grows without care; its branches, which extend horizontally along the &s;urface of the ground, by their &s;hade &s;tifle the growth of

all &s;uch weeds, as might &s;hoot up within their circumference: at the end of eighteen months the coffee-tree begins to bear fruit, and in three years yields a plen|tiful crop. They plant the&s;e trees chequer-wi&s;e, at about the di&s;tance of &s;even feet from one another, and, when they grow too tall, prune them to the height of perhaps two feet from the ground.</P>
<P>The coffee-tree demands a light foil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it thrives better in &s;and al|mo&s;t pure, than in rich ground: they ob&s;erve in the i&s;le of Bour|bon, that the&s;e trees yield annu|ally, one with another about a pound of coffee: this fruit comes to perfection, and is gathered in during dry weather, which gives it a great advantage over the We&s;t India coffee, which never ripens nor is got in but in the rainy &s;ea&s;ons.

<P>Since the days of the celebrated M. de la Bourdo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nois (who go|verned this i&s;land for ten or twelve years, and ought to be regarded as the founder of the colony, for his introduction and patronage of agriculture) they have wandered ince&s;&s;antly from project to project, attempting the culture of almo&s;t every &s;pecies of plants, without properly pro&s;e|cuting any one of them. The coffee, the cotton, the indigo, the &s;ugar cane, the pear, the cinnamon, the mulberry, the tea, and the cocoa trees have all been cultivated by experiments, but in &s;uch a &s;uperficial manner as could never &s;ecure &s;ucce&s;s. Had they followed the &s;imple plan of the founder, which was to &s;ecure bread, the i&s;land would at this day have been flouri&s;hing; Abundance would then have reigned among&s;t the coloni&s;ts, and the &s;hipping never been di&s;|appointed of the nece&s;&s;ary re|fre&s;hments and provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The cultivation of grain, ne|verthele&s;s, though neglected and badly under&s;tood, is that which &s;ucceeds the be&s;t. Tho&s;e lands, which are &s;o employed, yield an|nually a crop of wheat, and ano|ther of rice or Turkey corn, without the intervention of one follow year, and without the lea&s;t improvement, or any other mode

of labour, than that which is practi&s;ed at Madaga&s;car.</P>
<P>The <HI>Manaic</HI> was fir&s;t introduced into this i&s;land by M. de la Bour|donnois: the culture of this plant was at fir&s;t attended with very great difficulty, but it is now the principal re&s;ource of the coloni&s;ts for the nouri&s;hment of their &s;laves. As the culture of this root is here the &s;ame as in Ame|rica, I &s;hall not repeat what has been related by a number of tra|vellers.</P>
<P>They formerly brought from Madaga&s;car, black cattle and &s;heep; but &s;ince they have di&s;co|vered that more advantage at|tends the tran&s;portation of &s;laves, they have neglected the increa&s;e of their cattle, which the conti|nual demands of the &s;hipping, and the wants of the inhabitants at the &s;ame time, daily dimini&s;h: be&s;ides, they have never hitherto formed any pa&s;tures; &s;uch as they have attempted having been laid out with &s;o little &s;kill, that they have not &s;ucceeded. The i&s;land produces naturally, in dif|ferent cantons, an excellent kind of gra&s;s, which grows to the height of five or &s;ix feet. This gra&s;s begins to appear above ground about the beginning of the rainy &s;ea&s;on; it performs all its vegetation during the three months, which this &s;ea&s;on la&s;ts: the inhabitants take advantage of this to pa&s;ture their herds, who fatten upon it amazingly; but, the vegetation over, there remains nothing on the ground but a &s;traw too hard to afford nouri&s;h|ment to the cattle; and, &s;oon after, the fire, which is kindled here by a thou&s;and accidents, con&s;umes this &s;traw, and with it frequently part of the neighbour|ing fore&s;ts. During the remain|der of the year, the herds wander about and langui&s;h among&s;t the woods.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t fault which has been committed in this i&s;land, and which has proved mo&s;t pre|judicial to cultivation, is the method of clearing the woods from off the ground by fire, without leaving groves and thick|ets at proper di&s;tances. The rains, in this i&s;land, conduce mo&s;t to the amelioration of the grounds; but the clouds being &s;topt by the fore&s;ts, there the rains fall; whil&s;t the cleared lands are &s;carce watered by a &s;in|gle drop: the fields, at the &s;ame time, being thus deprived of de|fence, are expo&s;ed to the violence of the winds, which often entire|ly de&s;troy the harve&s;ts.&mdash;The Dutch, as we have before ob&s;er|ved, found no trees at the Cape; but they have planted them there as &s;helter for their habitations.

have attained to the &s;ize of our ordinary nuts, which happens &s;oon after the fall of the flower: he then makes an inci&s;ion in the &s;talk of the clu&s;ter about &s;even or eight inches from the trunk of the tree; here he fa&s;tens an earthen ve&s;&s;el to receive the juice, which i&s;&s;ues in great abundance: the mouth of the ve&s;&s;el he carefully wraps round with a cloth, to pre|vent the admi&s;&s;ion of the air, which would &s;oon turn it to the fret.

<HEAD>The <HI>KINGDOM</HI> of <HI>SIAM.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE kingdom of Siam, &s;i|tuate on the penin&s;ula of the Indies beyond the Ganges, is in general extremely fertile.&mdash; Divided, like Indo&s;tan, by a chain of mountains from north to &s;outh, it enjoys, all the year round, and at the &s;ame time, two very oppo&s;ite &s;ea&s;ons. The we&s;|tern divi&s;ion, all along the bay of Bengal, is deluged by continual rains, during the &s;ix months that the mon&s;oons continue to blow from the we&s;t. This &s;ea&s;on is con&s;idered as their winter on this coa&s;t; whil&s;t in the other divi&s;ion of the kingdom, towards the ea&s;t, they enjoy the fine&s;t climate, and never experience that difference of &s;ea&s;on, which reigns on the we&s;tern &s;ide, except by the over|flowing of the Menam. This noble river runs along a great way among mountains, where the rains concenter: it wa&s;hes the walls of the capital, and annu|ally overflows, without the lea&s;t ravage, a delightful country, co|vered all over with rich plantati|ons. The &s;lime, which the Me|nam leaves behind, enriches the &s;oil prodigiou&s;ly; the rice &s;eems to grow up in proportion as the inundation ri&s;es, and the river at length gently retires by degrees into its bed, as the rice approach|es to maturity, and has no further occa&s;ion for its waters. How bountiful has nature been to tho&s;e who inhabit this charming coun|try!&mdash;&s;he has, however, done more: the fields produce, in pro|fu&s;ion, an infinite variety of mo&s;t delicate fruits, which require al|mo&s;t no cultivation; &s;uch as the pine apple, the mangou&s;tas, (the mo&s;t delicate fruit perhaps in the world) mangoes of different kinds and all excellent, &s;everal &s;pecies of oranges, the banana, the du|cion, the gacca, with other fruits of inferior quality. Nature, &s;till more bountiful, has al&s;o &s;cattered over this country, almo&s;t on the &s;urface of the ground, mines of gold, copper, and a &s;pecies of fine tin, which there, as in other parts of India, they name <HI>Calin.</HI></P>
<P>In this terre&s;trial paradi&s;e, &s;ur|rounded with &s;o much riches, who would imagine that the Si|ame&s;e are, perhaps, the mo&s;t wretched people in the world?</P>
<P>The government of Siam is de|&s;potic: the &s;overeign alone en|joys that liberty which is natural to all mankind: his &s;ubjects are all his &s;laves; every one of them is annually taxed at &s;ix months per&s;onal &s;ervice without wages, and even without food: he al|lows them the other &s;ix months to procure them&s;elves wherewithal to exi&s;t the year. Under &s;uch a government, there is no law that can afford protection to individu|als again&s;t violence, or in the &s;malle&s;t degree &s;ecure them in their property. Every thing is &s;ubjected to the caprice of a prince, rendered brutal by every &s;pecies of exce&s;s, particularly that of power; who pa&s;&s;es his days locked up in his &s;eraglio, with|out an idea of any thing beyond the walls of his palace, and par|ticularly ignorant of the wretched condition of his &s;ubjects. The&s;e are expo&s;ed to the avarice of the grandees, who them&s;elves are only

the chief &s;laves, and tremblingly approach, on appointed days, the pre&s;ence of their tyrant, whom they adore like a divinity, though &s;ubject to the mo&s;t dangerous caprices.</P>
<P>Religion alone has pre&s;erved the power of protecting again&s;t tyranny tho&s;e who, ranging them|&s;elves under its &s;tandard, are ad|mitted into the order of the prie&s;ts of <HI>Somonacondom,</HI> the deity of the Siame&s;e. Tho&s;e who embrace this order, and their number is con&s;iderable, are by law obliged to ob&s;erve the &s;tricte&s;t celibacy which, in a warm climate, &s;uch as that of Siam, whil&s;t it occa&s;i|ons great di&s;orders, almo&s;t depo|pulates the country.</P>
<P>It may ea&s;ily be conceived, that under &s;uch a government agri|culture cannot flouri&s;h; it may be &s;aid, even, that no regard is paid to it at all, when the &s;mall por|tion of ground which is laboured, is compared to the immen&s;e ex|tent of lands which are totally neglected.</P>
<P>With regard even to tho&s;e grounds which they have laid out, nature may be &s;aid to do e|very thing. Men oppre&s;&s;ed, de|ba&s;ed, without &s;pirit, nay, in a manner without hands, give them|&s;elves &s;carce any other trouble than ju&s;t to reap what the earth produces; and, as the country is exten&s;ive, and thinly peopl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, they enjoy abundance of nece&s;&s;a|ries, almo&s;t without labour.</P>
<P>From the port of Mergin, &s;itu|ated on the we&s;tern coa&s;t of this kingdom, to the capital, during a journey of ten or twelve days, you cro&s;s immen&s;e plains, charm|ingly watered, and the &s;oil excel|lent; &s;ome of which appear to have been formerly tilled, but now lie quite uncultivated.

<P>The environs of the capital are cultivated; the lands belonging to the king, tho&s;e of the princes, the mini&s;ters, and principal offi|cers di&s;play the amazing fertility of the country, producing, as I have been a&s;&s;ured, an increa&s;e of two hundred-fold.</P>
<P>The Siame&s;e method of culti|vating their rice, is fir&s;t to &s;ow it very thick in a &s;mall &s;quare plot of ground, well watered, a little below the &s;urface of the earth. As &s;oon as the plants have grown about five or &s;ix inches high, they pull them up, by the roots, and tran&s;plant them in &s;mall parcels of three or four &s;talks, di&s;tant from each other about four inches every way. The&s;e plants are placed deep in a clay &s;oil, which has been previou&s;ly well laboured with a plow, dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wn by two buf|faloes. The rice, tran&s;planted in this manner&punc; has beyond compa|ri&s;on a much greater increa&s;e, than if allowed to grow up in the &s;ame ground where it was origin|ally planted.</P>
<P>It is the Chine&s;e, and the Co|chinchine&s;e, &s;ettled in the capi|tal and its neighbourhood, who contribute mo&s;t to the improve|ment of the grounds. The&s;e &s;trangers are u&s;eful to the &s;ove|reign, by the commerce they car|ry on with him, and it is the in|tere&s;t of the government to protect them from oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="015853_0030_0F9A2E840F343E10">In the neighbourhood of the uncultivated lands I have menti|oned, you find others, belonging to different individuals, who, di&s;couraged by continual oppre&s;|&s;ions, have quite abandoned them.

<P>The orchards of the prince, and the great Talapoins,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A religious order.</NOTE> are ad|mirable for the variety of their fruits, all of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite kind; but the&s;e delicacies no private individual is allowed to enjoy. When a man is &s;o unhap|py as to have in his grounds a tree of excellent fruit &s;uch as the mangou&s;tas, a party of &s;oldiers never fail to come every year, to &s;ecure, for the king, or &s;ome great mini&s;ter, the produce of this tree. They take an account of every mangou&s;ta, good or bad, making the proprietor guardian and &s;ecurity for the whole; and, when the fruits ripen, &s;hould there happen the &s;malle&s;t defici|ency, the poor proprietor is &s;ub|jected to all the in&s;olence of un|re&s;trained power; it becomes, of con&s;equence, a real misfortune for a private man to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch a tree.</P>
<P>The Siame&s;e rear herds of buf|faloes, and horned cattle; but all the care they take of them is, to conduct them, in the day time, to the fallow grounds, which a|bound in pa&s;tures, and re conduct them, in the evening, to the in|clo&s;ures, in order to &s;ecure them from the tygers, of which there are great numbers in this coun|try. The milk, and a very little labour, is all the advantages they draw from them. Their religi|on, which is the &s;ame that pre|vails in Indo&s;tan, and which the Talapoins alone know any thing about, forbids them killing the&s;e animals. They elude, however, this law, by &s;elling them to the Mahometans &s;ettled among them, who kill them, and &s;ell their fle&s;h privately. They have al&s;o great numbers of poultry, particularly ducks, of the be&s;t kinds in the Indies.</P>
<P>The king maintains a number of tame elephants. Each of the&s;e mon&s;trous animals has twelve or fifteen men daily employed in cut|ting herbs, bananiers, (a kind of large ro&s;e) and &s;ugar canes.&mdash; They are after all of no real u&s;e; they &s;erve only for &s;hew. They di&s;play, &s;ay the Siame&s;e, the grandeur of their prince; and be conceives an idea of his greatne&s;s, more from the number of his ele|phants, than from the number of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals, wherever they come, make mo&s;t de&s;tructive ha|vock; of this their keepers take advantage, making every indivi|dual, who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of cultiva|ted lands, or gardens, pay annu|ally a certain tribute: &s;hould they refu&s;e, the elephants would immediately be let loo&s;e, and ra|vage and ruin de&s;olate their fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lds: for what &s;ubject would be hardy

The habits of the Malais are exactly adapted to their &s;hapes, and loa|ded with a number of buttons, which fa&s;ten them clo&s;e to their bodies in every part.&mdash;I relate the&s;e &s;eemingly trifling ob&s;ervati|ons, in order to prove, that, in climates the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite, the &s;ame laws produce &s;imilar man|ners, cu&s;toms and prejudices &mdash; Their effect is the &s;ame too with re&s;pect to agriculture.</P>
<P>The lands po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Malais are, in general, of a &s;upe|rior quality. Nature &s;eems to have taken plea&s;ure in there a&s;|&s;embling her mo&s;t favourite pro|ductions. They have not only tho&s;e to be found in the territo|ries of Siam, but a variety of o|thers peculiar to the&s;e i&s;lands.&mdash; The country is covered with o|doriferous woods, &s;uch as the ea|gle or aloes wood, the &s;andal, and the ca&s;&s;ia odorata, a &s;pecies of cinnamon. You there breathe an air impregnated with the odours of innumerable flowers of the greate&s;t fragrance, of which there is a perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion the year round, the &s;weet flavour of which captivates the &s;oul, and in&s;pires the mo&s;t voluptuous &s;en&s;ations.

<P>The Malay i&s;lands produce va|rious kinds of dying woods, par|ticularly the <HI>Sapan,</HI> which is the &s;ame with the Bra&s;il wood. There are al&s;o a number of gold mines, which the inhabitants of Sumatra and Malacca call <HI>Ophirs:</HI> &s;ome of which, tho&s;e e&s;pecially on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t, are richer than tho&s;e of Bra&s;il or Peru. There are likewi&s;e mines of fine copper, mixed with gold, which the in|habitants name <HI>Tombage.</HI> In the i&s;lands of Sumatra and Banea are mines of calin, or fine tin; and at Succadana, in the i&s;land of Borneo, is a mine of diamonds. Tho&s;e i&s;lands enjoy al&s;o, exclu|&s;ively, the rotin, the &s;agou, (or bread palm-tree) the camphre, and other precious aromatics, which we know under the names of various &s;piceries.</P>
<P>The &s;ea too teems with abun|dance of excellent fi&s;h, together with ambergris, pearls, and tho&s;e delicate birds ne&s;ts (&s;o much in reque&s;t in China) formed in the rocks with the &s;pawn of fi&s;hes, and the foam of the &s;ea, by a &s;pecies of &s;mall-&s;ized &s;wallow, peculiar to tho&s;e &s;eas: this is of &s;uch an exqui&s;ite &s;ub&s;tance and flavour, that the Chine&s;e long purcha&s;ed them for their weight in gold, and &s;till buy them at an exce&s;&s;ive price.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of all this luxuri|ance of nature, the Malay is mi|&s;erable. The culture of the lands, abandoned to &s;laves, is fallen in|to contempt The&s;e wretched labourers, dragged ince&s;&s;antly from their ru&s;tic employments, by their re&s;tle&s;s ma&s;ters, who delight in war and maritime enterprizes, have rarely time, and never re&s;o|lution, to give the nece&s;&s;ary at|tention to the labouring of their grounds. Their lands, in gene|ral, remain uncultivated; and produce no kind of grain for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the inhabitants.</P>

<HEAD>SAGOU.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;agou tree, in part, &s;upplies the defect of grain. This admirable tree is a pre&s;ent which bountiful nature has made to men incapable of labour. It requires no culture; it is a &s;pe|cies of the palm-tree, which grows naturally, in the woods, to the height of about twenty or thirty feet; its circumference being &s;ometimes from five to &s;ix. Its ligneous bark is about an inch in thickne&s;s, and covers a multitude of long fibres, which, being in|terwoven one with another, enve|lope a ma&s;s of a gummy kind of meal. As &s;oon as this tree is ripe, a whiti&s;h du&s;t, which tran|&s;pires through the pores of the leaves, and adheres to their ex|tremities, proclaims its maturity. The Malais then cut them down near the root, divide them into &s;everal &s;ections, which they &s;plit into quarters: They then &s;coop out the ma&s;s of mealy &s;ub&s;tance, which is enveloped by and ad|heres to the fibres; they dilute it in pure water, and then pa&s;s it through a &s;training bag of fine
<PB N="37" REF="015853_0034_0F9A2E870EE581D0">
cloth, in order to &s;eparate it from the fibres. When this pa&s;te has lo&s;t part of its moi&s;ture by eva|poration, the Malais throw it in|to a kind of earthen ve&s;&s;els, of different &s;hapes, where they allow it to dry and harden. This pa&s;te is whole&s;ome nouri&s;hing food, and pre&s;erves for many years.</P>
<P>The Indians, in general, when they eat the &s;agou, u&s;e no other preparation than diluting it in water; but &s;ometimes they dre&s;s it after different manners: they have the art of &s;eparating the fin|e&s;t of the flower, and reducing it to little grains, &s;omewhat re&s;em|bling grains of rice. The &s;agou, thus prepared, is preferred to the other, for the aged and infirm; and is an excellent remedy for many complaints in the &s;tomach. When diluted, either in cold or boiling water, it forms a whiti&s;h jelly, very agreeable to the ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Though this &s;agou-bearing-palm grows naturally in the fo|re&s;ts, the Malay chiefs have formed con&s;iderable plantations of it, which con&s;titute one of their principal re&s;ources for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>They might have the fine&s;t or|chards in the world, would they give them&s;elves the trouble to col|lect the various plants of tho&s;e ex|cellent fruits which nature has &s;o liberally be&s;towed upon them: we find, however, none but a few &s;traggling trees planted at ran|dom around their hou&s;es, or di&s;|per&s;ed over their lands without &s;ymmetry or order.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the great i&s;land of Java have &s;omewhat better ideas of agriculture, than the other Malais, &s;ince their &s;ub|jection to the government of the Dutch. The&s;e &s;overeign mer|chants have taken advantage of the feudal &s;y&s;tem of the Malais, to reduce them under their yoke; artfully weakening the regal pow|er, by fomenting, at times, the rebellions of the great va&s;&s;als; and humbling the va&s;&s;als in their turn, by &s;uccouring their princes, when drove to the brink of ruin.</P>
<P>The Javane&s;e begin to recover from that &s;tate of anarchy, the con&s;equence of their ancient laws now almo&s;t no longer remember|ed. They cultivate, with &s;ucce&s;s, rice, coffee, indigo, and &s;ugar|cane. They rear, on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of the i&s;land, and in the di&s;tricts of Madur and Solor, in the neighbourhood, numerous herds of buffaloes, of a mon&s;trous &s;ize; their fle&s;h is excellent, and they are of infinite u&s;e in labour|ing the ground. They have likewi&s;e numbers of horned cattle, the large&s;t and fine&s;t, perhaps, in the world&punc; The common pa&s;tur|age in this, and the re&s;t of the Malay i&s;lands, is the &s;ame gra&s;s I have mentioned under the arti|cle of the i&s;le of France, which the coloni&s;ts there almo&s;t entirely neglect.</P>
<P>Here it would be proper to de|&s;cribe the manner of cultivating the &s;piceries, the indigo, the &s;u|gar-cane, and the camphre; but the&s;e mu&s;t be the &s;ubject of ano|ther di&s;cour&s;e.

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>I La&s;t year began to give you a &s;ketch of my inquiries into the &s;tate of agriculture among differ|ent nations of Africa and A&s;ia. I ob&s;erved, that &s;carce a ve&s;tige of it could be traced among&s;t the &s;tupid, the indolent negroes, who inhabit the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Afri|ca; whil&s;t it flouri&s;hed, under the &s;hade of liberty, among&s;t the Holanders at the Cape of Good Hope. I pointed out the happy abundance which reigned in the fertile i&s;land of Madaga&s;car, in|habited by a people governed by the greate&s;t &s;implicity of manners, and unacquainted with other laws than tho&s;e of nature. Whil&s;t I did ju&s;tice al&s;o to the &s;y&s;tem of cultivation that prevailed at the i&s;le of Bourbon, which, having no port, and of con&s;equence little or no intercour&s;e with Europe, the coloni&s;ts have pre&s;erved an uncorrupted &s;y&s;tem of manners, ever favourable for agriculture, I was at the &s;ame time, under the nece&s;&s;ity of acknowledging, that this art, which requires per&s;ever|ance and &s;implicity, was greatly
<PB N="39" REF="015853_0036_0F9A2FB24F4CDEC0">
neglected at the i&s;le of France, which, having two excellent ports, and being much frequented by European &s;hips, was more influ|enced by the incon&s;tant and vola|tile manners of our quarter of the world; and that, in con&s;equence, though the &s;oil, in point of ferti|lity, was equal to Madaga&s;car and Bourbon; their harve&s;t ge|nerally failed, and an almo&s;t per|petual &s;carcity prevailed over the i&s;land.&mdash;I pa&s;&s;ed from thence to the great penin&s;ula of the Indies, where agriculture, however op|pre&s;&s;ed by the barbarous laws of the Mogul conquerors, is &s;till honoured and &s;upported by the religion, the manners, and the per&s;everance of the conquered Malabars.&mdash;At Siam, under the happie&s;t climate, and ble&s;&s;ed with a &s;oil inferior in fertility to no country in the world, agriculture we have ob&s;erved deba&s;ed by the indignities of tyranny, and aban|doned by a race of &s;laves, whom nothing can intere&s;t, after the lo&s;s of liberty.&mdash;I have repre&s;ented it almo&s;t in the &s;ame condition a|mong&s;t the Malais, who inhabit immen&s;e dominions, and innu|merable i&s;lands, where nature has di&s;tributed her choice&s;t trea|&s;ures, and lavi&s;hed her bounties with a profu&s;ion unknown to o|ther regions. The de&s;tructive genius of the feudal laws, which keep this people in a perpetual ferment, permits not their appli|cation to the culture of the fine&s;t &s;oil in the world. Nature alone does all. I am convinced, that if the other nations of the earth, who have the mi&s;fortune to be govern|ed by the feudal &s;y&s;tem, inhabit|ed a climate equally happy, and lands equally fertile with tho&s;e of the Malais, their agriculture would be equally neglected: nece&s;&s;ity alone could force the plough into their hands.</P>
<P>In my la&s;t di&s;cour&s;e I endea|voured to give you an idea of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting modes of local a|griculture which came under my ob&s;ervation: my principal object, however, was to enable you to remark, that in every country, in every quarter of the world, the &s;tate of agriculture depends en|tirely on the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws, and, con&s;equently, on the manners, cu&s;toms, and prejudices from which the&s;e laws derived their origin. I now proceed.</P>

<P>DEPARTING from the pe|nin&s;ula of Malacca, and the i&s;lands of the Malais, towards the north, I fell in with a &s;mall ter|ritory called <HI>Cancar,</HI> but known, on the marine charts, under the name of <HI>Ponthiamas.</HI> Surrounded by the kingdom of Siam, where de&s;poti&s;m and depopulation go hand in hand; the dominions of Camboya, where no idea of e&s;ta|bli&s;hed government &s;ub&s;i&s;ts; and the territories of the Malais, who&s;e genius, perpetually agitated by their feudal laws, can endure peace neither at home nor abroad: This charming country, about fifty years ago, was uncultivated,

and almo&s;t de&s;titute of inhabi|tants.</P>
<P>A chine&s;e merchant, comman|der of a ve&s;&s;el which he employed in commerce, frequented the&s;e coa&s;ts. Being a man of that in|telligent reflective genius, which &s;o characteri&s;tically marks his na|tion, he could not, without pain, behold immen&s;e tracts of ground condemned to &s;terility, though naturally more fertile than tho&s;e which formed the riches of his own country: he formed, there|fore, a plan for their improve|ment. With this view, having fir&s;t of all hired a number of la|bourers, &s;ome Chine&s;e, others from the neigbouring nations, he, with great addre&s;s, in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the favour of the mo&s;t powerful princes, who, for a certain &s;ub&s;idy, a&s;&s;igned him a guard for his protection.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of his voyage to Batavia, and the Philippine I|&s;lands, he borrowed from the Eu|ropeans their improvements, par|ticularly the art of fortification and defence; with regard to in|ternal police, he gave the prefer|ence to the Chine&s;e. The profits of his commerce &s;oon enabled him to rai&s;e ramparts, &s;ink ditches, and provide artillery. The&s;e pre|liminary precautions &s;ecured him from a coup de main, and pro|tected him from the enterprizes of the &s;urrounding nations of bar|barians.</P>
<P>He di&s;tributed the lands to his labourers, without the lea&s;t re&s;er|vation of any of tho&s;e duties or taxes known by the names of &s;er|vice or fines of alienation; duties, which by allowing no real pro|perty, become the mo&s;t fatal &s;courge to agriculture, and is an idea which revolts again&s;t the common &s;en&s;e of every wi&s;e na|tion. He provided his coloni&s;ts, at the &s;ame time, with all &s;orts of in&s;truments proper for the la|bour and improvement of their grounds.</P>
<P>In forming a labouring and commercial people, he thought, that no laws ought to be framed, but tho&s;e which nature has e&s;ta|bli&s;hed for the human race in e|very climate: he made the&s;e laws re&s;pected by obeying them fir&s;t him&s;elf, and exhibiting an exam|ple of &s;implicity, indu&s;try, fruga|lity, humanity, and good faith: &mdash;he formed, then, no &s;y&s;tem of laws&mdash;he did more&mdash;he e&s;tabli&s;h|ed morals.</P>
<P>His territories &s;oon became the country of every indu&s;trious man, who wi&s;hed to &s;ettle there. The woods were cleared; the grounds judiciou&s;ly labo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed, and &s;own with rice; canals, cut from the rivers, watered their fields; and plentiful harve&s;ts, after &s;upplying them with &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, furni&s;hed an object of commerce.</P>
<P>The barbarians of the neigh|bourhood, amazed to &s;ee abun|dance &s;o &s;uddenly &s;ucceed to &s;te|rility, flocked for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to the magazines of Ponthiamas; who&s;e dominions, at this day, are con&s;idered as the mo&s;t plentiful granary of that ea&s;tern party of A&s;ia; the Malais, the Cochin-chine&s;e, the Siame&s;e, who&s;e coun|tries are naturally &s;o fertile, con|&s;idering this little territory as the mo&s;t certain re&s;ource again&s;t fa|mine.</P>

<P>THE Cochin-chine&s;e, who border on Camboya to the north, ob&s;erving the lands of this kingdom de&s;olate and abandoned, &s;ome years ago took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch tracts as were mo&s;t conveni|ent, and have there introduced an excellent culture.

<P>They rai&s;e al&s;o two other &s;orts of dry rice, which grow in dry foil, and, like our wheat, re|quire no other watering but what they receive from the clouds.&mdash; One of the&s;e &s;pecies of rice has a grain as white as &s;now; when dre&s;&s;ed it is of a &s;limy vi&s;cous &s;ub|&s;tance; they make of it different kinds of pa&s;te, &s;uch as vermicelli. Both the&s;e kinds form a con&s;ider|able article in their commerce to China. They cultivate them on|ly on the mountains and ri&s;ing grounds, which they labour with the &s;pade. They &s;ow the&s;e grains as we do wheat, about the end of December or beginning of Janu|ary, when the rainy &s;ea&s;on ends: they are not above three months in the ground, and yield a plen|tiful crop.</P>
<P>I am induced to believe, that the culture of this valuable grain would &s;ucceed extremely well in France. In the years 1749 and 1750 I often travelled over the mountains of Cochin-china, where this rice is cultivated; they are very high, and the temperature of the air cold: in the month of January, 1750, I ob&s;erved that the rice was very green, and a|bove three inches high, although the liquor in Reaumur's thermo|meter was only about four degrees above the freezing point.</P>
<P>I carried &s;ome quintals of this grain to the i&s;le of France, where it was &s;own with &s;ucce&s;s, and pro|duced a greater crop than any o|ther &s;pecies. The coloni&s;ts re|ceived my pre&s;ent with the great|e&s;t eagerne&s;s, as, exclu&s;ive of its &s;uperior increa&s;e, it has a finer ta&s;te, is attended with le&s;s trou|ble, there being no nece&s;&s;ity for overflowing the fields; and, as it ripens fifteen or twenty days &s;ooner than the other kinds, it can be reaped and &s;ecured before the hurricane &s;ea&s;on, which fre|quently makes dreadful havock with their later harv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ts. The other kinds of rice, being of a &s;lower growth, require their grounds to be laid under water, after the manner of the Coroman|del

coa&s;t;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Page <HI>28.</HI></NOTE> but our coloni&s;ts pay &s;o little attention to agriculture, that they have never hitherto in|troduced it.</P>
<P>One might have imagined, that the advantages flowing from the cultivation of dry rice, would have engaged the coloni&s;ts to at|tend to it with the greate&s;t care; and that, from the i&s;le of France, it might have been with ea&s;e in|troduced into Europe: but I have in vain endeavoured to produce it from this i&s;land; tho&s;e to whom I have applied, have &s;ent me only common rice, which demands water and warmth. The culture of dry rice has, like every other &s;pecies of agriculture, been a|bandoned to the unexperienced ignorance of &s;laves, who have mixed all the different kinds to|gether, in &s;uch a manner, that the rice of Cochin-china being ripe long before the others, the grains have dropt from the ears before they were reaped, and the &s;pecies, in this manner, has been, by degrees entirely lo&s;t in that i&s;land. Would any traveller, whom bu&s;ine&s;s or curio&s;ity might lead to Cochin-china, &s;end over but a few pounds of this excellent grain, he would de&s;erve our warme&s;t acknowledgements.</P>
<P>The Cochin chine&s;e cultivate the common rice nearly in the &s;ame manner with the Malabars on the Coromandel coa&s;t. After having twice ploughed their ground, they &s;ow the rice in a little field which has been well laboured with the &s;pade; the &s;ur|face of this little field they ju&s;t cover with water, to the height only of a few lines; and as &s;oon as the rice is about five or &s;ix inches high, they harrow over their large fields, and overflow them with water; then pulling up the rice plants in the &s;eed plots, tran&s;plant them into the&s;e grounds thus prepared, in &s;mall parcels of four or five &s;talks, about the di&s;|tance of &s;ix inches the one from the other. Women and children are generally employed in this work.</P>
<P>The Cochin-chine&s;e have no machine for overflowing their grounds, nor have they any occa|&s;ion: their plains, from one end of the kingdom to the other, are commanded by a chain of high mountains, plentifully &s;upplied with &s;prings and rivulets, which naturally overflow the grounds, according as their cour&s;e is di|rected.</P>
<P>They cultivate likewi&s;e differ|ent kinds of grain, &s;uch as the mahis, millets of different &s;orts, &s;everal &s;pecies of the French bean, potatoes, yams, and a variety of roots proper for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of men and animals. But the cul|ture of mo&s;t important advantage to them, next to the rice, is the &s;ugar cane; and no country in A&s;ia produces it in greater abun|dance than Cochin-china.</P>

<HEAD>SUGAR-CANES.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ugar-canes of this country are of two kinds; the fir&s;t grows thick and tall, the joints at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from one another, the colour al|ways green, the juice abundant, with very little of the &s;alt in it. This &s;pecies of cane is in general u&s;e for feeding and fattening of cattle; and experience teaches them, that no kind of food fat|tens &s;ooner or better the human &s;pecies, as well as animals, than this &s;ugar cane, eat while green, and the &s;ugar which is extracted from it.</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;pecies is &s;maller in every re&s;pect, with its joints approaching nearer together:&mdash; when ripe it a&s;&s;umes a yellow co|lour; and contains le&s;s water, and more &s;alt, than the other.</P>
<P>The Cochin-chine&s;e, when preparing the ground for the &s;u|gar-cane, turn it up to the depth of two feet; this operation is per|formed with a plank. They then plant joints or eyes of the cane, three and three together, in a ho|rizontal po&s;ition, in the &s;ame manner almo&s;t as they plant vines in &s;everal provinces of France&mdash; The&s;e &s;lips are planted ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">quer|wi&s;e about eighteen inches deep in the ground, di&s;tant &s;ix feet from one another; this operation they perform near the end of the rainy &s;ea&s;on, in order that the &s;lips may be &s;ufficiently watered, till &s;uch time as they have taken root. During the fir&s;t &s;ix months, they give them two dre&s;&s;ings with a kind of pick-axe, in order to de&s;troy the weeds, and pre&s;erve a moi&s;ture about the roots of the canes, by heaping the earth a|round them.</P>
<P>Twelve and &s;ometimes fourteen months after the plantation, they gather the fir&s;t crop. By this time the canes, though planted at the di&s;tance of &s;ix feet, become &s;o bu&s;hy that it is impo&s;&s;ible to enter the field, without the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of a hatchet to clear your way.</P>
<P>The canes being cut, and tied up into bundles, are carried to their mills, in order to extract their juice. I &s;hall not here de|&s;cribe the form of the&s;e machines, which re&s;emble in a great mea|&s;ure tho&s;e of the We&s;t-Indies:&mdash; in&s;tead of water, they employ horned cattle or mules to &s;et in motion the two cylinders, be|tween which the &s;ugar canes are pre&s;&s;ed. The&s;e engines have been de&s;cribed by numbers of travel|lers.</P>
<P>The juice being extracted, they boil it &s;ome hours in large kettles, in order to evaporate part of its water: it is then tran&s;ported to the neighbouring market, and &s;old in that condition. Here ends the indu&s;try and the profits of the Cochin chine&s;e planter.&mdash; The merchants purcha&s;e the juice, which re&s;embles pure water; they boil it again, throwing into the kettles &s;ome alkaline &s;ub&s;tance, &s;uch as the a&s;hes of the leaves of the mu&s;a or bananier, and &s;hell-lime; they are acquainted with no other; the&s;e ingredients throw up a thick &s;cum, which the refin|er carefully &s;kims off; the action of the alkali ha&s;tens the &s;eparation of the &s;alt from the water, and,
<PB N="46" REF="015853_0043_0F9A2FB78FBDD4B8">
by the force of ebullition, reduces the juice of the cane to the con|&s;i&s;tence of &s;yrup. As &s;oon as this &s;yrup begins to granulate, they decant it into a great earthen ve&s;|&s;el, where they cool it about an hour; when a kind of cru&s;t, &s;till &s;oft, and of a yellowi&s;h colour, appeals on the &s;urface of the &s;y|rup; they lo&s;e not a moment then to empty it into a ve&s;&s;el of a co|nic &s;hape, which they call a <HI>form.</HI> Without this intermediate opera|tion of cooling the &s;yrup, it would harden into a ma&s;s, and not being granulated, would con|&s;equently want one e&s;&s;ential qua|lity of &s;ugar.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ugar-cones, or forms in Cochin-china are, like tho&s;e of our We&s;t-India colonies, of baked earth, about three feet high, pierced at their narrow extremi|ties, and contain in general about forty or fifty pounds of &s;ugar.&mdash; The&s;e <HI>forms,</HI> when full, are pla|ced on another earthen ve&s;&s;el, the mouth of which is proportioned to receive the narrow end of the cone, and mu&s;t be large enough to contain the coar&s;e &s;yrup, which di&s;tils from the &s;ugar, through &s;ome &s;traw which imperfectly &s;tops up the little opening in the bottom of the <HI>form.</HI></P>
<P>When they &s;uppo&s;e the &s;yrup has acquired the con&s;i&s;tence of &s;alt in every part of the cone, they then proceed to whiten and purify it. They dilute, in a trough, a fine &s;ort of whiti&s;h clay, with &s;uch a quantity of water as, when thus prepared, prevents it from having too much con&s;i&s;tence; with a truel they then lay it upon the &s;urface of the &s;ugar to the thick|ne&s;s of about two inches, in the void &s;pace left at the top of the form by the conden&s;ing of the &s;ugar, after purging it&s;elf of the coar&s;er &s;yrup or mela&s;&s;es. The water contained in the clay pene|trating by degrees into the ma&s;s, wa&s;hes it, and carries off in&s;en&s;i|bly the remaining &s;yrup, and e|very foreign particle that adheres mo&s;t clo&s;ely to the &s;ugar. When the clay hardens, they replace it with a fre&s;h quantity, diluted as the fir&s;t: This operation, which la&s;ts about twelve or fifteen days, is the &s;ame here as in our We&s;t-India colonies. Some refiners of Cochin-china, however, have a|nother method. In place of clay, tempered thus with water, they cut into &s;mall pieces the trunk of the mu&s;a or bananier, which they place upon the &s;ugar: The trunk of this tree is very watery; the water of a detergent quality; and di&s;tils from the fibres, which en|velope it, in very &s;mall drops.&mdash; Tho&s;e who follow this method pretend, that the operation is thereby rendered le&s;s tedious, and that the &s;ugar acquires a finer colour.</P>
<P>The proce&s;s of the Cochin-chine&s;e, in refining their &s;ugar, goes no further: They are unac|quainted with the &s;toves in u&s;e in the We&s;t-Indies. After having clayed their &s;ugars &s;ufficiently, they &s;ell them in the public mar|kets, particularly to the Chine&s;e, and other &s;trangers, who are in|vited to their ports by the mode|rate price of this commodity, which is cheaper at Cochin-china than any where in India.</P>
<P>The white &s;ugar of the be&s;t quality is generally &s;old at the port of Fai&s;o, in exchange for o|ther merchandize, at the rate of three pia&s;tres (about fourteen &s;hillings) the Cochin-china quin|tal, which weighs from one hun|dred

and fifty to two hundred pounds French.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Ninety one pounds eight ounces French make one hundred pounds Engli&s;h.</NOTE> The trade in this commodity is immen&s;e.&mdash; The Chine&s;e alone, who&s;e lands do not produce enough for their own con&s;umpt, purcha&s;e annually from Cochin-china about forty thou&s;and barrels, weighing about two thou&s;and pounds per barrel.</P>
<P>This country, it &s;hould be ob|&s;erved, which produces this com|modity in &s;uch abundance, and at &s;o low a price, being a new king|dom, ought to be con&s;idered, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, as a colony: it is worthy ob&s;ervation too, that the &s;ugar-cane is there cultivated by free men, and all the proce&s;s of preparation and refining, the work of free hands. Compare then the price of the Cochin-chi|ne&s;e production with the &s;ame commodity which is cultivated and prepared by the wretched &s;laves of our European colonies, and judge if, to procure &s;ugar from our colonies, it was nece&s;&s;a|ry to authorize by law the &s;lavery of the unhappy Africans tran&s;|ported to America. From what I have ob&s;erved at Cochin-china, I cannot entertain a doubt, but that our We&s;t-India colonies, had they been di&s;tributed without re|&s;ervation among&s;t a free people, would have produced double the quantity that is now procured from the labour of the unfortu|nate negroes.</P>
<P>What advantage, then, has ac|crued to Europe, civilized as it is, and thoroughly ver&s;ed in the laws of nature, and the rights of mankind, by legally authori&s;ing in our colonies the daily outrages again&s;t human nature, permitting them to deba&s;e man almo&s;t below the level of the bea&s;ts of the field? The&s;e &s;lavi&s;h laws have proved as oppo&s;ite to its intere&s;t as they are to its honour, and to the laws of humanity. This remark I have often made.</P>
<P>Liberty and property form the ba&s;is of abundance, and good a|griculture: I never ob&s;erved it to flouri&s;h where tho&s;e rights of mankind were not firmly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. The earth, which mul|tiplies her productions with a kind of profu&s;ion, under the hands of the free-born labourer, &s;eems to &s;hrink into barrenne&s;s under the &s;weat of the &s;lave. Such is the will of the great author of our nature, who has created man free, and a&s;&s;igned to him the earth, that he might cultivate his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion with the &s;weat of his brow; but &s;till &s;hould enjoy his liberty.</P>
<P>The Cochin-chine&s;e, exclu&s;ive of the &s;ugar-cane, employ them|&s;elves in the culture of a variety of other productions, of great im|portance both to their interior fabrics, and external commerce.</P>
<P>They cultivate the cotton-tree, the mulberry, the pepper, the varni&s;h-tree, the date, the tea, the indigo, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ffron, to|gether with a plant peculiar to the country, called <HI>Tjai,</HI> which, being fermented like indigo, fur|ni&s;hes in great plenty a flower of a green colour, which, in dying, gives a durable tincture of a fine emerald colour. This plant would undoubtedly be a mo&s;t valuable pre&s;ent to our We&s;t-India colonies.</P>

proce&s;&s;es attending the&s;e different cultures. They will af|ford &s;ubject for &s;ome future me|moirs.</P>
<P>The &s;oil, in general, of Co|chin-china, is excellent, and they cultivate it well. Their moun|tains in general are fallow, as population is not even &s;ufficiently con&s;iderable for the cultivation of all the plain grounds they have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of in Camboya: The&s;e mountains produce, how|ever, the eagle or aloe-wood, which is the mo&s;t precious per|fume in the world; the &s;apan-wood, the &s;ame with that of Bra|&s;il; and the cinnamon, in &s;mall quantities indeed, but much &s;u|perior in quality to that of Cey|lon&punc;&mdash;The Chine&s;e pay three or four times more for it than for that which the Dutch import from that i&s;land. They have &s;everal &s;orts likewi&s;e of admirable wood for joyner and cabinet work, par|ticularly the ro&s;e wood; the tea-wood is excellent for building, and is preferred to all others in the con&s;truction of the royal gal|leys, having every pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">perty that can be wi&s;hed for either for beauty or &s;olidity. From their moun|tains al&s;o, and from the fore&s;ts with which they are covered, they procure ivory, mu&s;k, wax, iron, and gold in great abundance &mdash; The&s;e mountains too are full of game, &s;uch as deer, antelopes, wild goats, peacocks phea&s;ants, &amp;c. The chace is free to all, but dangerous from the number of tygers, elephants, rhinoceros, and other carnivorous and de|&s;tructive animals, with which the fore&s;ts abound.</P>
<P>The &s;ea, which wa&s;hes their coa&s;ts, as well as the rivers, are well &s;upplied with excellent fi&s;h. Every one has the liberty of fi&s;h|ing; and in this the Cochin-chine&s;e take great delight. I have already ob&s;erved, that they live chiefly on fi&s;h and rice.</P>
<P>Their dome&s;tic animals are, the hor&s;e for the road, the buffalo for labour, and the cow, the hog, the goat, the goo&s;e, the duck, and hens of various kinds, for the table. The&s;e animals thrive ex|tremely well, and are in great a|bundance. The king alone re|&s;erves to him&s;elf the exclu&s;ive right of breeding elephants for the war; and this is a re&s;ervation which no man envies him. He maintains generally four hundred of them: he could maintain four thou&s;and men at a much le&s;s ex|pence. The Cochin-chine&s;e have few good fruits; the pine apple, and oranges of different kinds, are the be&s;t their country produces. They do not cultivate the vine, though it is one of the native pro|ductions of their lands. They are but indifferently provided with pul&s;e. In a word, their or|chards and their gardens are very incon&s;iderable.&mdash;They attach them&s;elves to the more e&s;&s;ential branches of agriculture.</P>
<P>Although this art is not yet ar|rived at that degree of perfection in Cochin-China, to which it might be carried, with the ad|vantage of &s;uch an excellent &s;oil, yet the manners of the people be|ing very favourable, it flouri&s;hes greatly. The Cochin-chine&s;e are gentle, ho&s;pitable, frugal, and indu&s;trious. There is not a beg|gar in the country; and robbery and murder ab&s;olutely unknown.

<P>I Now approach the period of my Travels. Departing from the coa&s;ts of Cochin-china, and directing my cour&s;e towards the north-ea&s;t, I proceeded for China, which the Cochin chine&s;e call, with great re&s;pect, <HI>Nu&s;e d' ai Ming&mdash;the Kingdom of the Great Luminary.</HI> After &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me days na|vigation, before there was any appearance of land, I perceived along the horizon a fore&s;t of ma&s;ts, and &s;oon after an innumerable multitude of boats, which covered the &s;urface of the water.

I entered the river of Canton; it is peopled like the land; its banks lined with &s;hips at a chor; a prodigious number of &s;mall craft are continually gliding along in every direction, &s;ome with &s;ails, others wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h oars, vani&s;hing often &s;uddenly from the &s;ight, as they enter the number|le&s;s canals, dug with amazing la|bour, acro&s;s exten&s;ive plains, which they water and fertilize.

<HEAD>Ceremony of opening the Grounds.</HEAD>
<P>ON the fifteenth day of the fir&s;t moon, in every year, which generally corre&s;ponds to the beginning of March, the emperor in per&s;on performs the ceremony of opening the grounds. This prince, in great pomp, pro|ceeds to the field appointed for the ceremony: the princes of the imperial family, the pre&s;idents of the five great tribunals, and an infinite number of mandarins ac|company him. Two &s;ides of the field are occupied by the empe|ror's officers, and guards; the third is allotted for all the labour|ers of the province, who repair thither to behold their art ho|noured and practi&s;ed by the head of their empire; the fourth is re|&s;erved for the mandarins.</P>
<P>The emperor enters the field alone, pro&s;trates him&s;elf, and nine times &s;trikes his head again&s;t the ground, in adoration of <HI>Tien,</HI> the God of heaven; he pro|nounces, with a loud voice, a prayer appointed by the tribunal of rites, invoking the ble&s;&s;ing of the almighty &s;overeign on his labour, and on the labour of his people, who form his family; he then, in quality of &s;overeign pontiff of the empire, &s;acrifices a bullock, which he offers up to heaven, as the &s;ource of every ble&s;&s;ing: whil&s;t they cut the vic|tim in pieces, and place them on the altar, they bring to the em|peror a plough, in which are yoked a pair of bullocks, mag|nificently adorned. The empe|ror then, laying a&s;ide his royal robes, takes hold of the handle of the plough, and turns up &s;e|veral furrows the whole length of the field; then, with a complai|&s;ant air, having delivered the plough to the mandarins, they &s;ucce&s;&s;ively follow his example, emulating one another in per|forming this honourable labour with the greate&s;t dexterity. The ceremony concludes with the di&s;|tribution of money, and pieces of &s;tuff, among the labourers there pre&s;ent; the mo&s;t active of whom fini&s;h the remaining labour, in pre&s;ence of the emperor, with great agility and addre&s;s.</P>
<P>Some time after, when they have &s;ufficiently laboured and manured their grounds, the em|peror repairs again, in proce&s;&s;ion, and begins the &s;owing of the field, always accompanied with ceremony, and attended by the labourers of the province.</P>
<P>The &s;ame ceremonies are per|formed, on the &s;ame days, in all the provinces of the empire, by the viceroys, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by all the magi&s;trates of their departments, in pre&s;ence of a great number of the labourers of their re&s;pective provinces.

In Europe be|hold it at pre&s;ent flouri&s;hing, in a country which, during many preceding ages, was reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of begging &s;ub&s;i&s;tence among&s;t the neighbouring nati|ons, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a happier cli|mate, and a greater extent of territory. During tho&s;e ages of barbari&s;m, their lo&s;s of liberty and right of property brought a|long with them the ruin of culti|vation; nor has &s;he recovered tho&s;e natural rights of mankind, and re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the foundations of drooping agriculture, but through &s;eas of blood, and out|rages &s;hocking to humanity.</P>

<HEAD>In <HI>AFRICA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFRICA, in general, who&s;e regions, known to the an|cients, were con&s;idered as the granaries of the world, now pre|&s;ent nothing to the view but grounds entirely neglected, or wretchedly cultivated by the la|bour of &s;laves.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="description of agriculture">
<HEAD>In <HI>AMERICA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SOUTH-AMERICA, covered with mar&s;hes, brambles, and woods, beholds her exten&s;ive tracks hardened even by the &s;weat of her labourers in chains. The northern regions of that quarter of the world, before the arrival of the Europeans, was inhabited by incon&s;iderable tribes of &s;avages, mi&s;erable, and with|out culture; yet free, and, in con&s;equence, le&s;s wretched per|haps than tho&s;e nations who pre|tend to be civilized; but who, being farther removed from the laws of nature, by the privation of tho&s;e rights which &s;he be&s;tow, make ineffectual efforts to pro|cure that happine&s;s, which a good agriculture alone can produce.&mdash; Since the Europeans arrived, and began in earne&s;t to cultivate the lands, they have, by their great diligence in agriculture, wonder|fully improved the climate as well as the &s;oil; by continuing their attachment to agriculture, North-America will probably, in a few years, extend her commerce over the greate&s;t part of the globe.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="description of agriculture">
<HEAD>In <HI>ASIA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE va&s;t continent of A&s;ia offers to your con&s;ideration in one quarter, an immen&s;e un|cultivated region, peopled by a race of banditti, more intent on plunder than the cultivation of their grounds; in another, a great empire, formerly flouri&s;h|ing, and excellently laboured, now inhabited by the poor re|mains of a wretched people, pe|ri&s;hing with hunger from the neglect of agriculture, and &s;hed|ding their blood, not for liberty, but for a change of tyrants &mdash; This charming fertile quarter of the world (the cradle of the hu|man race) now beholds her lands in &s;lavery, her labourers in chains, &s;ubjected either to the blind de&s;|poti&s;m of unfeeling tyrants, or the de&s;tructive yoke of the feudal &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>But turn your eyes to the ea&s;t|ern extremity of the A&s;iatic con|tinent, inhabited by the Chine&s;e, and there you will conceive a ra|vi&s;hing idea of the happine&s;s the world might enjoy, were the laws of this empire the model of tho&s;e of other countries. This great nation unites under the &s;hade of agriculture, founded on liberty and rea&s;on, all the advantages

<P>Princes, who rule over nati|ons! arbiters of their fate! view well this per&s;pective; it is worthy your attention.

<P>He is the mo&s;t powerful of men, reigning over the hearts of the mo&s;t numerous &s;ociety in the world, who con&s;titute his family. &mdash; He is the riche&s;t of &s;overeigns, drawing from an extent of terri|tory &s;ix hundred leagues &s;quare, cultivated even to the &s;ummits of the mountains, the tenth of tho&s;e abundant harve&s;ts it ince&s;&s;antly produces: this he con&s;iders as the wealth of his children, and he hu&s;bands it with care.&mdash;To &s;um up all, he is the happie&s;t of mo|narchs, ta&s;ting every d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y the in|expre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure of giving hap|pine&s;s to millions, and alone en|joying, undivided, that &s;atisfac|tion which his &s;ubjects &s;hare&mdash; his children! all to him equally dear; all living like brothers, in freedom and abundance, under hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> protection.</P>
