<P>Whenever you have a mind to &s;peak with the Governour, if you will &s;end to me, I will give the Signal to call the Tribes to|gether, which will be the Firing a Gun from the Man of War, and hoi&s;ting the King's Jack on the Main Top-Ma&s;t-Head.</P>

<P>I have Complaints from the Fathers that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fell the <HI>Indians</HI> Rhum, and that they abu&s;e them with it; and I &s;hall be glad to hear from you what Means may be u&s;ed for preventing this Mi&s;chief for the future.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>What I &s;ay to you is a &s;erious Thing: You profe&s;s to Wor&s;hip GOD and JESUS CHRIST, and while you get Drunk, you mock Him, and wrong your &s;elves for this World and that to come. When the Rhum prevailes, you are like <HI>Bevers, Bears</HI> and <HI>Otters,</HI> and don't &s;hew your &s;elves after the Image of GOD in which you were made; and if there were no World to come, where you are to an&s;wer for this Wickedne&s;s, you hurt your &s;elves with Rhum, as to your Intere&s;t in this World; and Ill Men cheat you when you are Drunk with it, and make you give two Skins for one. This is a &s;erious Matter, and de|&s;erves Con&s;ideration.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>We will think of what your Excellency mentions to us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have more things to mention.</P>
<P>I have been to St. <HI>George</HI>'s, according to my Duty to King <HI>GEORGE,</HI> to view the King's Fort and the Land there, to con&s;ider what may be the mo&s;t advantageous to the KING and to His People, to be done in that River.</P>
<P>I have been to <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> and <HI>Richmond,</HI> to &s;ee the King's Forts there; and at <HI>Cu&s;hnock</HI> and other Places on <HI>Kennebeck</HI> River, to &s;ee the King's Lands there, and I would have gone further, even to <HI>Norridgewock</HI> and <HI>Penob&s;cot,</HI> if any of the Tribes had been there to accompany me. And as I went into your Country, I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee you at <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> Bro|thers and Friends &s;hould vi&s;it one another at their &s;everal Hou&s;es. It was in confidence of your &s;incere Di&s;po&s;ition to Peace, that I travel'd into tho&s;e Parts.</P>
<P>I hope you find the Trading Hou&s;es commodious for you, and that you are &s;upplyed cheaper there, than by the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Ca|nada.</HI></P>
<PB N="7" REF="003554_0007_0FF85F826F1DE7A8">
<P>The Government takes Care that you be &s;upplied cheaper than their own People: And I hope the more you are acquainted with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at <HI>Falmouth,</HI> and other Towns in the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, you will find the&s;e Settlements commodious and beneficial to you.</P>
<P>And as <HI>Loron</HI> &s;aid, If there &s;hould be any Cloud hanging over the Peace, you will take Care that we be informed timely of it.</P>
<P>Your coming hither to meet the Governour will not be &s;uch a Proof of your Friend&s;hip as your giving Notice of the&s;e things, and practicing Friend&s;hip with us.</P>
<P>I have no doubt but the more you are acquainted with the Engli&s;h, the more you will love them.</P>
<P>It &s;hall be &s;o much my Care to &s;eek your Intere&s;t and Advan|tage, as I doubt not will oblige you to &s;incere Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>The Government here have &s;ettled a Mini&s;ter at St. <HI>George's,</HI> and there will be another at <HI>Richmond.</HI> They will be always ready to in&s;truct you in the Principles of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and teach your Children to Read and Write, which &s;hall be with|out any Co&s;t to you.</P>
<P>If you are willing to &s;end your Children to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> they &s;hall be brought up to Learning at the <HI>College,</HI> that &s;o they may officiate as Fathers among you, and teach you the true Religion, and their Education &s;hall co&s;t you nothing.</P>
<P>Tho' you have learnt Religion of the <HI>French,</HI> which you may apprehend to be a good one, yet you &s;hould not be aver&s;e to look into another. Before you knew the <HI>French</HI> Religion, you tho't the <HI>Pagan</HI> Religion to be a good one, but when you were taught the <HI>French</HI> Religion, you tho't that better. And &s;o when you are in&s;tructed in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Religion, you may think that &s;till better than the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>If you have a mind to under&s;tand the true <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Religion, it &s;hall co&s;t you nothing; and when you under&s;tand it you will certainly know, that you are cheated, when your Sins are pre|tended to be pardon'd for Skins: This is all a Cheat and Deceit: None can pardon Sins but JESUS CHRIST; and He does it freely, without Money and without Price. All that the Prie&s;ts make you pay, they put in their own Pockets.</P>

<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Friend, We have been thinking of what your Excellency &s;aid to us ye&s;terday; and we will now make An&s;wer to it: As to the Lands, which you &s;aid are yours what we &s;hall &s;ay will not be new, but what has been formerly &s;aid. Your Excellency will go on in the Way that former Governours have gone in; which are the Articles of Peace made between us; which are to be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="003554_0009_0FF85F83F39E33F0">
As to Prayers, It was mention'd in the Treaty, that there &s;hould be no Di&s;pute about Religion. It would be a light Proceeding in us, to an&s;wer what you have &s;aid on that Affair; We are too few to enter into this Di&s;pute, which is a weighty Matter: There are other Tribes to be di&s;cour&s;ed with; and when we know their Mind we &s;hall be better able to An&s;wer: We had the Advice of the other Tribes about the Peace; and therefore we think it proper, to have their Advice in this Affair.</P>
<P>As to what was &s;aid of our Children, we are not qualified to an&s;wer as to the Propo&s;al for their Education, we being but few here, and the other Tribes being concerned in it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad you find the Road &s;o plain to walk in. This Government will &s;trictly ob&s;erve the Articles of Peace, by which we are bound to each other. I meet you further to &s;trengthen the Articles of Peace, and &s;hould be glad from Time to Time to hear from you what will further promote it.</P>
<P>As to the Settlement of the Lands and the making of Towns in King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Lands, it &s;hall always be according to the Treaties. I did not mention the Matter of Religion to make any Jar between us, but offer'd it as an In&s;tance of my brotherly Love; and becau&s;e I am perfectly &s;atisfied, it is the be&s;t way to your Intere&s;t in this World, and in the World to come. GOD has given you Rea&s;on to examine into the Matters of Religion. It will do you no Hurt to examine into the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Religion, for then you can chu&s;e that which you &s;hall judge is the be&s;t. The Government is willing to in&s;truct you on free Co&s;t. I have no|thing to do with the foreign Nations; You have &s;aid, you are free Men and you are my Brethren.

<P><HI>St. George</HI>'s is a great way from us, the Traders bring Goods near us; but it would be well if we could have their Goods at a cheaper Rate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Price of Goods at the Truck-Hou&s;es is &s;tated by the Government; and the Truck-Ma&s;ters can't impo&s;e upon you; but the Government can't re&s;train the private Traders as to their Price. This is what I offer in Friend&s;hip to you; for the private Traders do you &s;o much Mi&s;chief with their Rhum, that it is as bad as if they &s;hould &s;hoot you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>We only mention it to your Excellency; we don't suppo&s;e that the private Traders can be forced to &s;ell at a Price, but we &s;hould be glad it might be; and that they might be re|&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ined from &s;elling Rhum.</P>
<P>There is not a prudent Care as to the giving out of Liquor at St. <HI>George's,</HI> they give the Indians too much Rhum, which makes them Drunk; and we de&s;ire therefore that Care may be ta|ken to pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent it.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Govern</SPEAKER>
<P>I will give effectual Orders that you &s;han't be abu|&s;ed by the I&s;&s;uing of Rhum at the Truck-Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>By the Articles of Peace King <HI>GEORGE</HI> has Power to &s;et|tle Towns on His Lands; and I purpo&s;e to &s;ettle a Town at <HI>Cu&s;hnock,</HI> and then the Trade will be nearer to you.</P>
<P>When I pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;e any thing, and you don't object, I &s;uppo&s;e you con&s;ent. If there &s;hould be a Town, you &s;hall have Lands there,

<P>This Propo&s;al I made to you Ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>You told me ye&s;terday, that there was not much Bu&s;ine&s;s, the Peace being already concluded; this Interview was only to &s;ee one another. I have been a great while from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and the King's Bu&s;ine&s;s requires my &s;peedy return thither. I &s;hall be glad, if you have any thing to offer, you would mention it this Afternoon: For I purpo&s;e you &s;hall dine with me To-Morrow, in order to di&s;mi&s;s you the Day after.</P>
<P>In all things we &s;hould be frank and open, and no Body &s;hould be here that are afraid to be known. This I &s;ay, becau&s;e I hear there are two <HI>French</HI> Men pre&s;ent; and I &s;hou'd not Care if their Ma&s;ter was here too. I will always do Ju&s;tice to you; but I will &s;upport King <HI>GEORGE's</HI> Honour, who is Lord and Sovereign here; and the <HI>French</HI> &s;hall know it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Heart is much engaged to prevent the Mi&s;chief of the private Trade; the Government receives no Damage by it; but there is Danger that it will make a Mi&s;under&s;tanding be|tween us: For by this Means you have had &s;uch Inju&s;tice done you, as the Government can't &s;et to rights: but the&s;e Abu&s;es will not be offer'd you at the publick Truck-Hou&s;e.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are to &s;peak every thing that is true, and hide nothing: As to the Trade, it was agreed, that we &s;hould have the Goods as cheap as at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>; and the Governour told us that Goods would be govern'd by the foreign Markets, &s;ometimes cheaper and &s;ometimes dearer; but the Goods have always ri&s;en in their Price.</P>

<P>You all agreed that the <HI>Penob&s;cot</HI> Tribe &s;hould &s;peak for all.

<P>I &s;peak for the <HI>Amere&s;coggin</HI> Indians.

</SP>

<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>That <HI>Negro</HI> is a Servant to the Truck-Ma&s;ter, and he mu&s;t have &s;ome Body to manage the Trade in his Ab&s;ence; he is a very hone&s;t Man. GOD made us of different Colours, the <HI>Negros</HI> black, the <HI>Indians</HI> not &s;o black, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> white; and I don't de&s;pi&s;e the <HI>Indians</HI> becau&s;e they are not &s;o white as the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> for they are as GOD made them.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have &s;omething to offer further: Your Excellency was plea&s;ed to &s;ay we &s;hould &s;peak plainly. As to the di&s;tant Tribes, we think there is &s;omething yet wanting. As there is Friend&s;hip, we wonder that Powder &s;hould be wanting for us to fire a little with. It was mention'd at the Treaty, that Powder &s;hould be given to each Tribe. If the Pre&s;ent &s;hould be given, tho&s;e that are at a Di&s;tance would think that there is Love be|tween us; and we are of Opinion that when other Tribes &s;ee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, they would think there is hearty Love between us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean by what you &s;ay of Powder?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>We mean a Pre&s;ent of Powder and Shot, which was mention'd in the Treaty. As to the Sloop that comes a Trading to <HI>Penob&s;cot,</HI> we don't de&s;ire they &s;hould be forbid, becau&s;e it is profitable to us, but only we are willing they &s;hould be forbid bringing Rhum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad it lies much upon your Mind to have the Trade of Rhum prevented. There is no &s;uch effectual Way to prevent your being drown'd with Rhum, as your not having to do with private Traders. If there be Convenience for a Sloops coming Spring and Fall to <HI>Penob&s;cot</HI> River, I will endeavour that the Government &s;hall &s;end a Sloop at tho&s;e Sea&s;ons, to bring them every thing but Rhum; and I hope you will not be di&s;con|tented, if I order my People not to Trade with you in that Article.</P>

</SP>

<P>We have another &s;mall Matter to &s;ay: When we come to <HI>St. George's,</HI> we have not Liberty to ly in any of the Hou&s;es, but are expo&s;ed to ly abroad in the Rain and bad Wea|ther; we therefore de&s;ire a Hou&s;e to lodge in.</P>

<P>'Tis the fir&s;t Time I have heard of it. I will give Order to my Captains to &s;ee that you be treated with Ju&s;tice and Kindne&s;s.

<P>When I was in <HI>Kennebeck</HI> River, I had Complaints from the Inhabitants that they could keep no Sheep for the <HI>Indi|an</HI> Dogs: By the Treaty you are obliged to muzzle them. It may &s;eem a light Matter to you, to keep your Dogs loo&s;e, but it is a great Di&s;couragement to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> As I &s;hall &s;trictly ob&s;erve every Article of the Peace, &s;o I expect you &s;hould, and therefore you mu&s;t take Care to keep your Dogs from doing this Mi&s;chief to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Inhabitants.</P>
<P>I have a Complaint again&s;t one of the young Men of the <HI>Nor|ridgewock</HI> Tribe from one <HI>Samuel Harden,</HI> that they kill'd five of his Hor&s;es at <HI>Hunnawell's</HI> Point, to the Value of <HI>Forty 
<PB N="15" REF="003554_0015_0FF85F8B6AECFF98">
Pounds,</HI> for which he has had no Satisfaction. Taking away Men's E&s;tates is like taking away their Lives; and their denying it will not Excu&s;e them. All the Articles of the Peace are made in the Pre&s;ence of GOD, who ob&s;erves the&s;e things; and I expect Satisfaction for this Injury. I ob&s;erve your Young Men &s;mile at this; but it is a &s;erious Matter; if you are in want, you mu&s;t tell us of it. The&s;e things will endanger a War. You will think it very hard, if our Young Men &s;hould &s;teal your Skins. I believe one of tho&s;e Young Men is here now; and I would have him come and tell me why he kill'd tho&s;e Hor&s;es.</P>

<P>It adds to the Guilt to deny the Fact. And I &s;up|po&s;e your Father does not teach you to do &s;uch Things and then deny it. You &s;hould follow &s;uch In&s;tructions as are good from your Father.</P>

There is a great Difference as you know well between Spring and Fall <HI>Bever</HI>: The Market in <HI>England</HI> will always govern the Price here; and as great Quantities of <HI>Bever</HI> are carried there from other Places be&s;ides this, that will have an Influence upon the Price here, whether you get much or little: I &s;hall be glad when the Market will allow of a greater Price, which I &s;hall let you know of; and you may depend on it in all Ca&s;es to have &s;trict Ju&s;tice done you: We take Care that the Trade be govern'd as much to your Advantage as may be. You are &s;upplied cheaper from us than from the <HI>French,</HI> which is plain, becau&s;e they buy of us to &s;ell to you.</P>

It is a great while &s;ince the Affair happen'd at <HI>Norridgewock,</HI> and I &s;hould be glad you had mentioned that Matter before, and then it would have been ea&s;ier to have recover'd tho&s;e Things than now: Maj <HI>Moulton</HI> is here, who can tell you that the Plun|der taken at <HI>Norridgewock,</HI> was divided among the Soldiers, Capt. <HI>Parker</HI> has got the Paper you mention, and will be ready to deliver it upon your paying the Price of it: I &s;hould be glad you could have any other Things return'd; but our People made but little Account of them, and I believe the mo&s;t of them are lo&s;t.</P>
<P>I am well plea&s;ed that Capt. <HI>Wood&s;ide</HI> of <HI>Maquoit</HI> is kind to you, and I &s;hall be glad every Body el&s;e would be &s;o too. When Capt. <HI>Wood&s;ide</HI> does what is good, it is prai&s;e-worthy in him; but if he breaks the Laws of the Province, he mu&s;t be puni&s;hed for it.</P>

<P>We mention'd the &s;ame Difficulties as to Trade, when we were at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> e&s;pecially about Mr. <HI>Noyes</HI>'s Conduct; and you &s;aid, the Thing was too far off to be &s;een, but you would enquire into it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard no further Complaints of the&s;e Things: Mr. <HI>Noyes</HI> deals fairly and ju&s;tly by you; It is no Intere&s;t of his to take your <HI>Bever</HI> at a low Price: But you may be &s;ure you will have Ju&s;tice done you.</P>

<P>When we were at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> you &s;aid to Capt. <HI>Gyles</HI> and Capt. <HI>Heath,</HI> we were &s;o far off, you could not tell whether or no things were done as they were repre&s;ented.</P>

You may remem|ber in the Cour&s;e of your Lives, that when you are &s;ober, you are a&s;hamed of what you do in Drink: And from the&s;e Occa&s;ions you &s;hould re&s;olve again&s;t Drinking Rhum.</P>

<P>I &s;peak in behalf of the <HI>Pigwackets</HI> and <HI>Amere&s;cog|gins</HI>; As your Excellency was plea&s;ed to tell them, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and they &s;hould hunt together, and both be benefited by the Hunting and Fi&s;hing; we de&s;ire that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> may not have the &s;ole Advantage, for by their &s;etting their Nets, it pre|vents the Fi&s;h running up the River, for the U&s;e of the <HI>Indians.</HI> We de&s;ire that both <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> may have the Benefit of the Fi&s;h. We &s;hould be glad that Goods may be lodged at <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> Fort for the <HI>Indian</HI> Trade. At times when Capt. <HI>Smith</HI> has not been at <HI>Saco,</HI> we pay his Negro, and then Capt. <HI>Smith</HI> demands it again, &s;o that we have often Paid twice for the &s;ame things.</P>

<P>Capt. <HI>Smith</HI> tru&s;ted me, and I paid the Negro in his Ab&s;ence; and after that, Capt. <HI>Smith</HI> made me Pay the &s;ame again. I borrow'd <HI>Eight Shillings</HI> of Capt. <HI>Smith,</HI> and paid the Negro, and afterwards Capt. <HI>Smith</HI> took <HI>Eight Shillings</HI> more, &s;o that I Paid <HI>Sixteen Shillings.</HI> And at another time, I left Skins in the Negro's hands, which I was to take out in Rhum, and yet the Negro made me Pay for the Rhum.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Smith</HI> deny'd the Charge, and refer'd to his Account, and &s;aid that upon this Indians being di&s;&s;atisfied, he had &s;eve|ral Times Paid him twice for the &s;ame Things, to make him ea&s;y.</P>
