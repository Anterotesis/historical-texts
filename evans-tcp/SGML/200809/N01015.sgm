<P>THERE is often found a truth in that which has been by many ob&s;erved, <HI>viz.

<P>Now, Fir&s;t; <HI>Faith</HI> in the Lord JESUS CHRIST, is pre&s;uppo&s;ed in them that <HI>Walk in the Name</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST.

But <HI>Then,</HI> there is a <HI>Faithful|ne&s;s</HI> to the Lord JESUS CHRIST, which mu&s;t attend and a&s;&s;ert our <HI>Faith</HI> in Him. This <HI>Faithfulne&s;s,</HI> is not &s;o much <HI>Faith,</HI> as <HI>Obedience.</HI> 'Tis not our <HI>Tru&s;t</HI> in Him; 'Tis our <HI>Tru&s;tine&s;s</HI> to Him.

<P><PB N="6" REF="001212_0011_0FB131E41D51A168">We will carry on the Lovely Repre&s;entation. A <HI>Faithful Chri&s;tian,</HI> is a Chri&s;tian <HI>Mindful</HI> of the <HI>Obligations,</HI> which are laid upon him, to Glorify the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. There is no Chri&s;tian, but what is under many <HI>Bonds</HI> and <HI>Vows</HI> to Glorify the Lord. The <HI>Faithful</HI> Chri&s;tian is one, who does not Forget the <HI>Vows</HI> of God that are upon him. The Study, and the Language of the <HI>Faith|ful</HI> Chri&s;tian is that, P&s;al. 116.14. <HI>I will pay my Vows unto the Lord.</HI> A Chri&s;tian has Entred into <HI>Covenant</HI> with God. A <HI>Faithful</HI> Chri&s;tian is a <HI>Covenant-Keeping</HI> one; he is one who may &s;ay, <HI>Lord, I have not forgotten thee, nor have I dealt fal&s;e|ly in thy Covenant.</HI> Having been Wa&s;hed in the <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> of the Lord, the <HI>Faithful</HI> Chri&s;tian re|&s;olves; <Q>Let me now never <HI>Defile</HI> my &s;elf with Sin, from which I have been <HI>Purified;</HI> Let me now always cleave to that God, the <HI>Father,</HI> the <HI>Son,</HI> and the <HI>Spirit,</HI> unto whom I have been <HI>De|dicated;</HI> Let me now carry on the <HI>Wars of the Lord,</HI> under the <HI>Banners,</HI> to which I have been Li&s;ted.</Q> Having been Sitting at the <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord, the <HI>Faithful</HI> Chri&s;tian re&s;olves, <Q>I am now under an <HI>Oath</HI> to ob&s;erve the <HI>Law</HI> of my Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: I have taken the <HI>Sacrament</HI> upon it, that the <HI>Commandment</HI> of my Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hall always give <HI>Awe</HI> and <HI>Law</HI> unto me: I have Sworn the <HI>Death</HI> of my <HI>Sin,</HI> that my <HI>Soul</HI> may <HI>Live, O my Soul,</HI> How can&s;t thou do <HI>&s;o great a Wickedne&s;s, as to Sin again&s;t God</HI>?</Q></P>
<P>Moreover; A <HI>Faithful Chri&s;tian,</HI> is a Chri&s;tian careful to make a <HI>due Improvement</HI> of the <HI>Talents,</HI> which the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t has committed unto him.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="001212_0012_0FB131E58EFA3A80">A <HI>Faithful Servant</HI> is one who &s;ticks to the <HI>Bu|&s;ine&s;s</HI> which his <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> has given him to do: Even &s;uch is the <HI>Faithful Chri&s;tian</HI>: And the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is He, of whom the Faithful Chri&s;tian &s;ays, <HI>He is my MASTER; To Him I &s;till remember my &s;elf accountable.</HI> There is no Chri&s;tian, but what is be tru&s;ted with <HI>Talents,</HI> by and for the Lord. Our OPPORTUNITIES to <HI>Render,</HI> or <HI>Procure,</HI> ACKNOWLEDGMENTS unto our Lord JE|SUS CHRIST; The&s;e are our TALENTS. A <HI>Faithful</HI> Chri&s;tian, is very Sollicitous, that he may know and u&s;e his precious <HI>Opportunities,</HI> and that the Lord may have Service from him in them all. Hence, of him that made a Good u&s;e of his <HI>Talents,</HI> we read, Matth. 25.21. <HI>He is a faithful Ser|vant.</HI> The Soul of a <HI>Faithful</HI> Chri&s;tian is migh|tily concerned upon it. He often thinks; <Q>What <HI>Good</HI> may I do? What are my Capacities to do <HI>Good</HI>! How &s;hall I do the <HI>Good</HI> whereof God hath made be capable?

<P>It follows; A <HI>Faithful Chri&s;tian,</HI> is a Chri&s;tian that Labours to acquit him&s;elf well in the &s;everal <HI>Relations,</HI> wherein the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t has placed him. The <HI>Place</HI> wherein God &s;ets a man, is great|ly to be con&s;idered, by one that would be found <HI>A Faithful Man.</HI> Are we in <HI>Publick Relations</HI>? We read of a <HI>Preacher</HI>; Jer. 23.28. <HI>Let him &s;peak my word Faithfully.</HI> We read of a <HI>Ruler</HI>; Neh. 7.2. <HI>He was a Faithful Man, and feared God above many.</HI> Are

we in <HI>Private Relations</HI>? We read of <HI>Children;</HI> Tit. 1.6. They mu&s;t be <HI>Faithful Children.</HI> We read of <HI>Servants;</HI> Tit. 2.10.

And he endeavours to conform him|&s;elf unto the <HI>Expectations</HI> of the Lord.</P>
<P>Finally; A <HI>Faithful Chri&s;tian,</HI> is a Chri&s;tian that will own the <HI>Truths,</HI> and <HI>Wayes,</HI> and <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whatever may be the <HI>Trouble</HI> or <HI>Hazard</HI> of doing &s;o. What is a <HI>Faithful Chri&s;tian,</HI> but a <HI>Faithful Witne&s;s</HI> for the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t? The <HI>Truths</HI> of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; a <HI>Faithful</HI> Chri&s;tian will never Deny any of them. The <HI>Wayes</HI> of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; a <HI>Faithful</HI> Chri&s;ti|an will never De&s;ert any of them. Our Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t has a <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>People</HI> in the World; a <HI>Faithful</HI> Chri&s;tian will &s;tick to that People, and never betray them, never for&s;ake them. Whate|ver Intere&s;t of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t calls for the <HI>Te&s;timony</HI> of a Chri&s;tian, a <HI>Faithful</HI> Chri&s;tian will openly, zealou&s;ly, courageou&s;ly appear, to bear his <HI>Te&s;timony.</HI> We read, Ho&s;. 11.12. <HI>Judah was Faithful with the Saints.</HI> What is the meaning of that? There were <HI>Faithful</HI> Mini&s;ters of God, who could not <HI>conform</HI> to the Super&s;titions E&s;tabli&s;hed by <HI>Jeroboam.</HI> The&s;e, with other <HI>Saints</HI> of their Con&s;cientious Principle, were kindly entertained by <HI>Judah: Judah</HI> &s;tood by tho&s;e Non-conformi&s;ts of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> This was to be <HI>Faithful with the Saints.</HI></P>

<P>Now this <HI>Faithfulne&s;s,</HI> and Con&s;tancy <HI>unto Death,</HI> tis Demanded by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

He Shortens, he Re&s;igns his <HI>Life,</HI> to plea&s;e the Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t. <HI>Life, Life,</HI> &s;hall be his Portion.</P>
<P>We will proceed, Step after Step, unto the Con&s;olation.</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> The <HI>Faithful</HI> Chri&s;tian &s;hall at la&s;t be <HI>Deli|vered</HI> from all the Grievous and Heavy Things, which he may &s;uffer for his <HI>Faithfulne&s;s.</HI> All our <HI>Sufferings</HI> in and for our <HI>Faithfulne&s;s.</HI> come under the Name of <HI>Death.</HI> The <HI>Faithful</HI> Chri&s;tian &s;hall be brought into a State, wherein he &s;hall &s;ee no more <HI>Death.</HI> He &s;hall Enter in|to <HI>Life</HI>; and that <HI>Life</HI> will be a State, wherein he &s;hall &s;ee an End of all the <HI>Adver&s;ity</HI> which his <HI>Faithfulne&s;s</HI> was once Encumbred withal. We read, Rev. 21.4. <HI>God &s;hall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes, &amp; there &s;hall be no more Death.</HI> We &s;hall come into a State, wherein we &s;hall meet with no <HI>Temptation</HI> to abate of our <HI>Faithfulne&s;s.</HI> There will be no <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> crying unto us, <HI>Ma&s;ter, Spare thy &s;elf.</HI> There will be no <HI>Devil</HI> &s;hooting at us his <HI>Fiery Darts</HI> to di&s;courage us. There will be no <HI>Me&s;&s;enger of Satan</HI> to buffet us. As we read, P&s;al. 31.20, 21 <HI>Thou &s;halt hide them from the Pride of man; from the &s;trife of

<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> The <HI>Faithful</HI> Chri&s;tian &s;hall find his <HI>Faith|fulne&s;s</HI> lead him unto a <HI>Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s,</HI> which is called <HI>Life;</HI> which will be an <HI>Excellent,</HI> yea, an <HI>Eternal Life.</HI> Tis mo&s;t certain, That our <HI>Faithfulne&s;s</HI> to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t will <HI>End</HI> in <HI>Endle&s;s Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</HI> Wherein will con&s;i&s;t that <HI>Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s</HI>? In the <HI>Old</HI> Te&s;tament, we have it after that manner Expre&s;&s;ed: P&s;al. 17.15. <HI>I &s;hall behold thy Face in Righteou&s;ne&s;s; when I awake, I &s;hall be &s;atisfied with thy likene&s;s.</HI> In the <HI>New</HI> Te&s;tament, we have it Expre&s;|&s;ed after that manner; 1 Joh. 3.2. <HI>We know, that when He &s;hall appear, we &s;hall be like Him, for we &s;hall &s;ee Him as He is.</HI> That incomparable, that incomprehen&s;ible <HI>Ble&s;|&s;edne&s;s,</HI> which is intended for the <HI>Faithful</HI> Chri&s;tian, will be in the <HI>Vi&s;ion</HI> of God, and of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and in the <HI>Image</HI> of that Glorious Lord imparted unto him; and in a mo&s;t intimate <HI>Communion</HI> with the glorious Lord; and in unutterable Satisfactions produced by the <HI>Spirit of Glory</HI> for ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing of him. This <HI>Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s</HI> is call|ed, LIFE; and in that Name very precious things are intimated. A <HI>Faithful</HI> man may have his <HI>Death</HI> ha&s;ten|ed by his <HI>Faithfulne&s;s.</HI> No; His <HI>Life</HI> is not lo&s;t. <HI>Non homo moritur, &s;ed peccatum hominis:</HI> There <HI>Dies</HI> nothing of him, except that which is his very <HI>Death.</HI> His <HI>Faith|fulne&s;s</HI> only brings him to a <HI>Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s,</HI> which is the True&s;t <HI>Life.</HI> The <HI>Separate Soul</HI> of a <HI>Faithful</HI> man puts on the <HI>Garments of Light</HI>; and flies away to a <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> and there waits in <HI>Re&s;t</HI> and Peace, and Hope for the <HI>Re&s;urrection of the Dead.</HI> [Rev. 14.13.] There &s;hall at length arrive, [But, <HI>Oh Lord, How Long</HI>!] a <HI>Re&s;urrection

He &s;hall in that <HI>Body,</HI> live as a Citizen of the Heavenly City, till the very Hea|vens be no more. When a <HI>Faithful</HI> man <HI>Dies,</HI> tis to <HI>Live</HI> better than he did before. The <HI>Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s</HI> will be <HI>Life</HI>; Becau&s;e it will be <HI>De&s;ireable.</HI> It was &s;aid, <HI>What man is he, who de&s;ireth Life</HI>? Indeed, what man is he, who de&s;i|reth it not? There are few things, but what we part withal, to prolong our <HI>Life.</HI> Men are naturally and ge|nerally loth to <HI>Dy. Nature</HI> is never willing to <HI>Dy.</HI> The cry is, <HI>Life is Good</HI>! The <HI>Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s</HI> intended for us, may well be Styled <HI>Life</HI>: Becau&s;e indeed it is, [the Jews do well apply the Text unto <HI>this:</HI>] P&s;al. 63.3. <HI>Better than Life.</HI> And the <HI>Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s</HI> will be <HI>Life</HI>; Becau&s;e it will be <HI>Durable.</HI> T'will <HI>Endure</HI>; T'will be <HI>Everlasting.</HI> A <HI>Living Thing</HI> may <HI>Dy</HI>; But <HI>Life</HI> never can <HI>Dy.</HI> We &s;hall &s;ee <HI>Life,</HI> and never &s;ee any thing but <HI>Life.</HI> Our <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s</HI> will be <HI>Life</HI>; Becau&s;e it will be, 1 Pet. 5.10. <HI>An E|ternal Glory.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> The <HI>Faithful</HI> Chri&s;tian &s;hall after all his <HI>Faithfulne&s;s,</HI> be Rewarded and <HI>Advanced,</HI> even as with the <HI>Crown</HI> of an Illu&s;trious <HI>Conqueror.</HI> The Reward of the <HI>Faithful</HI> Chri&s;tian will be, A CROWN: 2 Tim. 4.8. <HI>A Crown of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> It is to tell us, That a very high <HI>Advancement</HI> &s;hall be the Reward of the <HI>Faithful</HI> Chri&s;ti|an. There is no higher <HI>Advancement</HI> propounded a|mong the Ambitious Children of men, than that of com|ing to a <HI>Crown.</HI> The <HI>Faithful</HI> Chri&s;tian may meet with much <HI>Reproach,</HI> and much <HI>Contempt</HI> in the World. If a|ny man will be <HI>Faithful</HI> to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and His Churches, that man &s;hall <HI>hear the Defaming of many.</HI> They that are <HI>Grievous Revolters</HI> from the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, will <HI>walk with Slanders</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Faithful</HI> Champions of the Lord. As it was complained; <HI>When I wept and cha&s;tened my Soul with Fasting, that was to my Reproach.</HI> Even &s;o, If the <HI>Faithful</HI> Servants of God are after the mo&s;t Holy manner, only <HI>Praying,</HI> and <HI>Fasting</HI> before the Lord, on the

<P>It was bowayled; P&s;al. 12.1. <HI>The Faithful fail from among the Children of men!</HI> Let it be de&s;ired by us; <HI>Lord, Let not me fail of being found among thy Faithful Children.</HI> Wherefore; Be <HI>Prayerful,</HI> O Chri&s;tian, That thou may&s;t be <HI>Faithful.</HI> We read, 1 Cor. 7.25.

<P>And then; To <HI>Supplication</HI> joyn <HI>Meditation.</HI></P>
<P>Often think; <HI>What are the Priviledges, What the Capacities, wherewith my Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>has Entru&s;ted me!</HI> We read, 1 Cor. 4.2. <HI>It is required in Stewards, that a man be found Faithful.</HI> Remember we, that we are bur <HI>Stewards</HI> of all that we have; And then be full of anxious Thoughts, How to acquit our &s;elves with <HI>Faithfulne&s;s</HI> in our <HI>Steward&s;hip.</HI></P>
<P>Again; Often think; <HI>What &s;pecial Intere&s;t of my Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>now calls for a &s;pecial Witne&s;s from me.</HI> We read, <HI>Prov.</HI> 14.5. about, <HI>A Faithful Witne&s;s.</HI> The Kingdom of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;ometimes is mo&s;t oppo&s;ed in one Article, &s;ome|times in another.

<P>Finally. Let us Tread in the Steps of them that have been <HI>Faithful.</HI></P>
<P>It was of old &s;aid; Prov. 20.6. <HI>A Faithful man who can find</HI>? Some <HI>Faithful Men</HI> have been <HI>found.</HI> We have Lately <HI>Lo&s;t</HI> &s;uch an One; Such an One was our WIGGLESWORTH, <HI>Who hath an good Re|port of all men.</HI> One who &s;o <HI>Faithfully</HI> demeaned him&s;elf, that (as <HI>Jerom</HI> directed of old,) <HI>De illo male Loqui nemo Potuit Sine mendacio.</HI> Becau&s;e, it may contribute unto the <HI>finding</HI> of more Such, I &s;hall give you &s;ome &s;hort Account of his <HI>Faithfulne&s;s;</HI> &amp; <HI>Proclaim his Goodne&s;s</HI>: but, as tis mo&s;t Rea&s;onable, my Account &s;hall be given with the mo&s;t accu|rate and un&s;potted <HI>Faithfulne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>I may truly affirm concerning him, That <HI>Faithfulne&s;s, Faithfulne&s;s,</HI> was the very thing that remarkably Characterized him, Di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him.</P>
<P>He was de&s;cended of Eminently Religious Pa|rents, who were great Sufferers for that which was then, The <HI>Cau&s;e of God,</HI> and of <HI>New-England.</HI> While he was yet a Youth, he was marvellou&s;ly concern|ed, That he might have an Heart filled with the Spirit of God. This concernment upon his mind appeared e&s;pecially in his Watchful Endeavours to have <HI>Spiritual Sins,</HI> cha&s;ed out of his clean&s;ed Heart. PRIDE, the Sin of <HI>Young</HI> men, yea, of <HI>all</HI> men; PRIDE, the Sin which few men Try or Trouble them&s;elves about; this Devout Youth, was full of Holy and Watchful Trouble about it: And he <HI>then</HI> wrote a very Savoury Di&s;cour&s;e, En|tituled, <HI>Con&s;iderations again&s;t Pride.</HI> And another
<PB N="23" REF="001212_0028_0FB132014EC693D8">
Entituled, <HI>Con&s;iderations again&s;t Delighting more in the Creature than in God.</HI> This was to mortify in him|&s;elf the Sins rarely minded by the mo&s;t of men.</P>
<P>Having had a Pious and a Learned Education, the fir&s;t Publick Station wherein I find him, was that of a <HI>Fellow,</HI> and a <HI>Tutor,</HI> in <HI>Harvard-Colledge.</HI> With a rare <HI>Faithfulne&s;s</HI> did he adorn the Station! He u&s;ed all the means imaginable, to make his <HI>Pupils</HI> not only good <HI>Scholars,</HI> but al&s;o good <HI>Chri&s;tians;</HI> and in&s;til into them tho&s;e things, which might render them rich Ble&s;&s;ings unto the <HI>Churches</HI> of God. Unto his Watchful and Painful E&s;&s;ayes, to keep them clo&s;e unto their <HI>Academical Exerci&s;es,</HI> he added, Serious Admonitions unto them about their Interiour State, and (as I find in his Re&s;erved Papers) he Employ'd his <HI>Prayers</HI> and <HI>Tears</HI> to God for them, &amp; had &s;uch a flaming zeal, to make them worthy men, that, upon Re|flection, he was afraid, Le&s;t his <HI>cares for their Good, and his affection to them, &s;hould &s;o drink up his very Spirit, as to &s;teal away his Heart from God.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Cambridge,</HI> the Star made his Remove, till he comes to di&s;pen&s;e his Sweet Influences, upon thee, O <HI>Maldon</HI>: And he was thy <HI>Faithful</HI> One, for about a <HI>Jubilee</HI> of years together.</P>
<P>It was not long after his coming to <HI>Maldon,</HI> that a Sickly Con&s;titution &s;o prevailed upon him as to confine him, from his Publick Work, for &s;ome whole Sevens of years. His <HI>Faithfulne&s;s</HI> continu|ed, when his <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> was thus interrupted. The Kindne&s;s of his Tender Flock unto him, was an&s;|wered in his Kind concern to have them Served by other Hands. He took a Short Voyage unto
<PB N="24" REF="001212_0029_0FB13203C0DAB060">
another Country, for the Recovery of his Health; which tho' he Recovered not, yet at his Return, I find him comforting him&s;elf, with in&s;erting of this Pa&s;&s;age, in his Re&s;erved Papers.</P>
<P><HI>Peradventure the Lord removed me for a Sea&s;on, that He might &s;et a better Watchman over this His Flock, and a more Painful Labourer in His Vineyard. This was one thing that I aimed at in Removing (to help the Peoples Mode&s;ty in the Ca&s;e,) and I believe the Lord aimed at it, in removing me for a Sea&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>His <HI>Faithfulne&s;s</HI> now appeared, in his <HI>Edifying Di&s;cour&s;es,</HI> to tho&s;e that came anear him; A Thing wherein he was very <HI>Careful</HI> and <HI>Fruitful</HI>; much bewayling the want of a Profitable and Religious Conver&s;ation, in &s;o many that Profe&s;s Religion. And that he might yet more <HI>Faithfully</HI> &s;et him&s;elf to Do Good, when he could not <HI>Preach,</HI> he <HI>Wrote</HI> &s;everal Compo&s;ures, wherein he propo&s;ed the E|dification of &s;uch Readers, as are for Truth's dre&s;|&s;ed up in a <HI>Plain Meeter.</HI> The&s;e Compo&s;ures have had their Acceptance and Advantage among that &s;ort of Readers; &amp; one of them, <HI>The Day of Doom,</HI> which has been often Reprinted in both <HI>Englands,</HI> may perhaps find our Children, till the <HI>Day</HI> it &s;elf arrive.</P>
<P>It plea&s;ed God, when the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Church in <HI>Maldon,</HI> did extremely call for it, won|drou&s;ly to Re&s;tore His <HI>Faithful Servant.</HI> He that had been for near Twenty years almo&s;t <HI>Buried A|live,</HI> comes abroad again; and for as many years more, mu&s;t in a <HI>Publick U&s;efulne&s;s,</HI> receive the An&s;wer and Harve&s;t of the Thou&s;ands of Suppli|cations, with which the <HI>God of his Health,</HI> had been addre&s;&s;ed by him &amp; for him.</P>

<P>How <HI>Faithful</HI> was he to the <HI>Work</HI> of God in the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> and Grieved at every thing that he thought had any Tendency to in|commode that glorious Work?</P>
<P>But how <HI>Patient,</HI> how <HI>Living,</HI> how <HI>Charitable,</HI> to &s;uch as in Le&s;&s;er matters differed from him! Of this <HI>Faithfulne&s;s,</HI> you are all of you Witne&s;&s;es!</P>

<P>For &s;uch things, his Flock Loved him. Your <HI>Love,</HI> &s;how'd it &s;elf, when a Dangerous Fit of <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> was upon him, above Seven years ago.
