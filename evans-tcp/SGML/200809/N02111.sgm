<HEAD>A Short ANSWER TO <HI>John Graham</HI>'s SERMON.</HEAD>
<P>I Ob&s;erve, fir&s;t, that <HI>John Graham</HI> takes for his Text, <HI>Heb.</HI> 13.9. <HI>Be not carried about with divers and &s;trange Doctrine</HI> &amp;c. And in his fir&s;t Page, &s;ays, <HI>the main Defects of Wit are Error and Ignorance.</HI> An&s;wer, I think it would have been much more proper for him to have &s;aid, <HI>Religion</HI> than <HI>Wit,</HI> &s;eeing his Di&s;cour&s;e is concerning Religion, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I &s;hall let that pa&s;s without further Notice, and &s;hall freely own, that <HI>Error</HI> and <HI>Ignorance</HI> are both very bad in Reli|gion, and very often are found together, one being, as it were the Effect of the other; for when People are kept in Ig|norance by their Teachers, and are not allowed, (nor do not take the Liberty them&s;elves) to &s;earch and try for them|&s;elves,
<PB N="4" REF="002508_0003_0FDB672499A87B40">
nor to prove all things, that &s;o they may di&s;cern Truth from Error, they are often, nay, generally kept in Error as well as Ignorance, and often made be|lieve, that <HI>Error</HI> is <HI>Truth,</HI> and <HI>Truth Er|ror.</HI> Therefore it behoves us all to con|&s;ider well what is Error and what Doctrines are <HI>Strange Doctrines,</HI> which I conclude all to be, that are contrary to the true Doctrines of Chri&s;tianity taught by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> and his Apo&s;tles. And to <HI>John Graham</HI> goes on preaching again&s;t Error and Ignorance, exhorting his hearers to beware of it, and warning them again&s;t conver&s;ing wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he People called <HI>Qua|kers,</HI> or reading their Books, pretending they are Guilty thereof, which if it were &s;o, I &s;hould allow his Cautions to be need|ful; but if on Tryal and Examination it &s;hould prove quite otherwi&s;e, and that the <HI>Quakers</HI> and their Books are Sound and <HI>Orthodox,</HI> and him&s;elf and his Book guilty of <HI>Error, Ignorance</HI> and <HI>&s;trange Doctrines,</HI> as I doubt not but I &s;hall plainly prove, and that by the Te&s;timony of Holy Scripture, which he, though im|properly,
<PB N="5" REF="002508_0004_0FDB6726A546C150">
calls the <HI>Word</HI> and would have all Spirits tryed by it.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I am willing that our Doc|trines, Principles and Practices, and his too, &s;hould be brought to the Te&s;t of Holy Scripture, and that which is not con|&s;onant and agreeable thereto, &s;hould be condemned, and that which is, to be approved; and when that is done, I make no Que&s;tion, but it will plainly appear that we are clear and him&s;elf guilty, &s;o I advi&s;e his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">rers and all others to Search and Try for them&s;elves like as the Noble <HI>Bereans</HI> did in Days of Old who when <HI>Paul</HI> preached to them, that which &s;ome then called <HI>&s;trange Doctrines,</HI> as <HI>Acts</HI> 17.20. for <HI>thou bringe&s;t certain &s;trange Things to our Ears,</HI> &amp;c. They &s;earched the Scriptures to &s;ee whether the&s;e things were &s;o, and did not to take their Teachers Words for it, that all is Error and Here&s;ie that they call &s;o; for that is the way to be kept in Ignorance and Darkne&s;s, as &s;ome whole Nations are at this Day, by heark|ning unto and following their Blind Guides, who call every Appearance of Light and Truth, by the Name of <HI>He|re&s;ie</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="002508_0005_0FDB672A21CB7188">
and <HI>Error, and if the blind lead the blind, both &s;hall fall into the Ditch,</HI> Mat. 15.14.</P>
<P>Therefore I de&s;ire all to &s;ee for them|&s;elves and try whether they be in the true Faith or not, &s;eeing we mu&s;t all give an Account every one for him&s;elf, before God, and then it will not be a &s;ufficient excu&s;e to &s;ay, our Teachers told us that the <HI>Truth</HI> was <HI>Error</HI> and <HI>Here&s;ie,</HI> and we took their Words for it, without further Tryal. So I &s;hall pa&s;s over the mo&s;t of the fore part of his Book, which is in general levelled again&s;t <HI>Error</HI> and <HI>Here&s;ie,</HI> and tho&s;e that Teach it, &s;eeing we are not &s;uch (though by him intended) that I may come to tho&s;e Particulars that &s;eem chiefly to concern Us, and our Doctorine, and prove them, even all that we Hold and Teach to be neither <HI>Error</HI> nor <HI>Here&s;ie,</HI> but <HI>Go&s;pel Truths,</HI> and that he is Guilty of <HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>Error,</HI> by oppo&s;ing and &s;peaking Evil of Truth, and tho&s;e that profe&s;s it, and walk therein, and thereby prove and make appear, <HI>that we are none of tho&s;e that are carried about with divers and &s;trange Doctrines,</HI> neither is the Light

that is in us Darkne&s;s, but the light of Chri&s;t, that lighteth every Man that cometh into the World, with the light of Life, See <HI>John</HI> 1. for that is the light that we &s;peak of and bear Te&s;timony of, and the <HI>Spirit of Truth</HI> that Chri&s;t &s;aid his Father would &s;end in his Name to lead true believers into all Truth.</P>
<P>IN Page 14. <HI>John Graham</HI> comes to particularize tho&s;e <HI>&s;trange Doctrines,</HI> that he had before preached again&s;t in general, and &s;ays, he &s;hall mention Eight, the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>is to deny the Morality of the fourth Commandment,</HI> and then &s;ays, there are a Sort of <HI>Creatures ari&s;en up who in open Defiance to God and all good Order, live in the con&s;tant Breach of an Expre&s;s Divine Law, by denying the Morality of the fourth Commandment.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Barely denying the Morality of the fourth Commandment is not living in a Breach of any Divine Law, for that Law was only given and commanded unto the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> as the re&s;t of the <HI>Mo&s;aical Law</HI> was, and therefore not moral and perpetual, nor binding to us, becau&s;e then commanded and written on

Yet there he is much not be&s;ide the Matter; for that Scripture relates matter of Fact, how that God made all things in Six Days, and re&s;ted the Seventh, but is no command at all, neither to <HI>Adam,</HI> nor any of this Po&s;terity, neither is there any command for the keeping of a Sabbath, to be found in all the Scrip|ture given to any People but only to the
<PB N="9" REF="002508_0008_0FDB67310A664310">
Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and therefore not binding to any other People; for what the Law &s;aith, it &s;aith to them that are under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aw. <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.19 but we are not under the Law, but under Grace, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.14. But he &s;ays, it was one of the Ten Com|mandments, and therefore concluded it mu&s;t be binding as well as the other Nine <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To which I &s;ay, the other Nine, are not binding to us, becau&s;e then command|ed to the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> &amp;c. but be|cau&s;e they are naturally Moral and Righ|teous Precepts, and belong to the Chri&s;tian Religion, and without the Ob&s;ervance of which we cannot be good Chri&s;tians, but we may without keeping the Jewi&s;h Sabbath or Seventh Day of the Week, which was the Sabbath commanded by that Law or Ten Commandments. Now though <HI>J. G.</HI> &s;ays in Page 15. that it is binding to all Men in all Ages, yet in Page 29. He &s;ays, becau&s;e the Jew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h Sabbaths were then annulled. See how con|tradictory this is, &s;o that now we may &s;ay, that he him&s;elf has denied the Morality and Perpetuity of the fourth Command|ment, but his Shift for this is, that it was

altered from the Seventh to the Fir&s;t Day of the Week after Chri&s;ts Re&s;urrection, but can prove no &s;uch thing, although he &s;trives hard for it, yet when he has done all he can, he only proves, that after Chri&s;ts Re&s;urrection the Apo&s;tles and pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|mitive Believers met together on the Fir&s;t Day of the Week for the Wor&s;hip of God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And &s;o do we, and more than that, we refrain from Bodily Labour; and what does <HI>J. G.</HI> and his Brethren more? So what does he cavil at? we keep the &s;ame Day as he does, and to the &s;ame Ends, &s;o that he might have &s;pared his Pains and long Stories on that Score from Page 14 to 35. mo&s;t part of which is not worth reading, &s;o I &s;hall &s;ay no more to tho&s;e two of this &s;trange Doctrines, &s;eeing if they are &s;o, he is guilty as well as we. His 3d &s;trange Doctrine is to deny the Old Te&s;ta|ment, the Ten Commandments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> We do not deny the Ten Com|mandments nor any other Part of the Old or New Te&s;tament, but highly e&s;teem them, as the Apo&s;tle &s;aid, to be profita|ble for Doctrine, Reproof, Correction and In&s;truction in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and we do
<PB N="11" REF="002508_0010_0FDB6736F4D4FE70">
frequently give good Proof thereof by Quoting them in our Writings and Prea|chings, as will plainly appear by our Friends Books, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Therefore this is a wrong charge and Reflection on us, unde&s;erved.</P>
<P>His 4th &s;trange Doctrine is to a&s;&s;ert the Spirit or Light within, in Oppo&s;ition to the Scripture, to be the only Guide.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> We do not &s;o A&s;&s;ert, for we know and A&s;&s;ert that the Scripture proceeded from the Spirit or Light within, for Holy Men of God &s;pake and wrote them as mo|ved by the Holy Spirit, &s;ee 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.20. 21. So they are a good Secondary Rule and Guide, but the Holy Spirit is the fir&s;t and be&s;t, &s;eeing it was before the Scripture, and the Scriptures proceeded from it, therefore mu&s;t be inferiour to it, but <HI>J. G.</HI> Argues very &s;trangely in Page 36 where he &s;ays, we are enjoyned to try the Spirits by the Word, by which I under&s;tand he means the Scriptures, though they are no where &s;o called in the Scripture; but on the contrary, Chri&s;t is called the Word in divers Places, as <HI>John</HI> 1.1.2.3. <HI>Rev.</HI> 19.13. Is it not ve|ry improper to give the &s;ame Name or
<PB N="12" REF="002508_0011_0FDB6737D7595350">
Title to the Scriptures, as is given to Chri&s;t the Son of God, who by way of Excellency is called the Word of God? And though <HI>J. G.</HI> &s;ays, the Light the Heathens had in them was Darkne&s;s, yet I cannot agree to that, neither doth <HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> 4.18. prove any &s;uch thing, only that &s;ome of the wicked Heathens had their under&s;tandings darkned, and that was for want of taking heed to the Light and be|lieving in it, whil&s;t it &s;hined into their Hearts, and would have manife&s;ted the Deeds of Darkne&s;s; but he &s;ays, the Light within is every Mans pretence, and in mo&s;t a fal&s;e Light, and in one contrary to an|other.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> The Light of Chri&s;t which we pretend to and bear Te&s;timony of is not a fal&s;e Light in any, but is the Light of life in all and is not in one contrary to what it is in another, but is one and the &s;ame in all and in full Unity, and makes manife&s;t the Deeds of darkne&s;s in all that take heed unto it; and the Primitive believers did take heed unto it, and were therefore Com|mended by the Apo&s;tle, and I de&s;ire that we may al&s;o take heed unto it when it
<PB N="13" REF="002508_0012_0FDB67394BC04D00">
Shines into our Hearts, which are by Na|ture Dark. His Fifth &s;trange Doctrine is to hold a State of &s;inle&s;s prefection attainable in this Life.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> If this be Strange Doctrine then Chri&s;t him&s;elf and his Apo&s;tles held and taught Strange doctrine as well as we, and &s;o we have good Company, for Chri&s;t taught his Di&s;ciples Prefection, be ye there|fore perfect as your Father that is in Hea|ven is Perfect <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.4, and the Di&s;ciple is not above his Ma&s;ter, but every one that is perfect &s;hall be as his Ma&s;ter, <HI>Luke</HI> 6.4. and the Apo&s;tles in many Places, exhorted the Believers to be perfect, and declared they were perfect <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 26.2. <HI>Cor</HI> 13.11. <HI>Ephes</HI> 4, 12.13. Col. 1.28. and 4.12.2. <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.17. <HI>Heb.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.19. and 12.23. and 13.21. <HI>Jam.</HI> 1.4. and 3.2, 1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.10. The&s;e with many more Scrip|tures that might be mentioned, do very plainly prove that Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles held the Doctrine of &s;inle&s;s Perfection at|tainable in this Life, and that they did experience it, and yet <HI>J G.</HI> has the con|fidence, to &s;ay, that it is contrary to the daily Experience of the mo&s;t Holy Men
<PB N="14" REF="002508_0013_0FDB673ACB2499A0">
alive, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Neither did <HI>Paul</HI> ever di&s;claim Perfection, though there was a Time when he had not attained it, neverthele&s;s, he then followed after and did afterwards at|tain it; nor does he declare Perfection to be re&s;erved to a future State, as <HI>J. G.</HI> &s;ays, quoting for his Proof 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.9, 10, 12. Which Place &s;peaks nothing of any other future State then in this Life.</P>
<P>His 6<HI>th &s;trange Doctrine</HI> is to <HI>hold total and final Apo&s;tacy</HI> from <HI>true Grace</HI>; by which I under&s;tand, he means to hold, that good Men that have received true Grace, may fall from it, loo&s;e it, and be|come wicked, and &s;o be lo&s;t or ca&s;t away.</P>
<P>Now if I cannot plainly prove this by plain Scripture Te&s;timony, then I &s;hall be contented to own, that I have hither|to held <HI>&s;trange Doctrine,</HI> but if I do prove it to be true <HI>Chri&s;tian Doctrine,</HI> it will follow, that he holds <HI>&s;trange Doctrine,</HI> in holding the contrary. The fir&s;t Scrip|ture that I &s;hall mention, is <HI>Ezek.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.8. where God by his Prophet expo&s;tulates largely with his People, and &s;hews the Equality of his ways over and over, by declaring, <HI>That the Wicked shall die for
<PB N="15" REF="002508_0014_0FDB673EC133C128">
his Sin,</HI> and the <HI>Righteous shall live by his Righteousne&s;s,</HI> and that <HI>the Son shall not bear the Iniquity of his</HI> Father, and <HI>ver&s;.</HI> 24. &s;ays <HI>but when the Righteous turneth away from his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and committeth Iniquity, and doeth according to all the Abominations that the wicked Man doth, shall he live? All his Righteou&s;ne&s;s that he hath done shall not be mentioned, in his Tre&s;spa&s;s that he hath Tre&s;spa&s;&s;ed, and in his Sin that he hath Sinned, in them shall he die,</HI> And ver&s;. 26 is to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. <HI>And John</HI> 15. Chri&s;t calls him|&s;elf the <HI>true Vine,</HI> and his Father the <HI>Husband-man,</HI> and his Di&s;ciples the <HI>Bran|ches,</HI> and &s;ays, <HI>Every Branch in me that beareth not Fruit, he taketh away.</HI> Now certainly tho&s;e Branches that are in Chri&s;t, have true Grace, and when they are taken away, they loo&s;e it. This the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> al&s;o confirms, in the 11th Chap. to the <HI>Romans,</HI> where he &s;ays, <HI>ver&s;.</HI> 6. <HI>For if the fir&s;t Fruit be Holy, the Lump is al&s;o Holy, and if the Root be Holy, So are the Branches.</HI> So that tho&s;e that are Bran|ches in Chri&s;t, the heavenly Vine, the Root of <HI>David,</HI> the bright and Morning

Star, are in a State of Grace, or have true Grace; and when they are taken away, they loo&s;e it, even by departing from the Faith, and making Shipwreck of it, and of a good Con&s;cience, as <HI>Hymeneus</HI> and <HI>Alexander</HI> did, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.20. See here is matter of Fact proved, <HI>Hymeneus</HI> and <HI>A|lexander</HI> had Faith and a good Con&s;cience, which none can have but by the Grace of God, and they had fallen from it. This appears further by what the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, in his Compari&s;on concerning the Olive-Tree, and being Grafted into it, and taken away again, and <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. <HI>v.</HI> 20. <HI>Well becau&s;e of &V;nbelief they were broken off, and thou &s;tande&s;t by Faith, be not high|minded, but fear; for if God &s;pared not the natural Branches, take heed le&s;t he al&s;o &s;pare not thee: Behold therefore the goodne&s;s and &s;everity of God; to them which fell Se|verity, but towards thee Goodne&s;s, if thou con|tinue in his Goodne&s;s, otherwi&s;e thou al&s;o shalt be cut off: And they al&s;o, if they bide not &s;till in Unbelief, shall be graffed in; for God is able to graff them in again.</HI></P>

and loo&s;e it, through Sin, Unbelief and Unwatchfulne&s;s, and afterwards may, through Repentance and turning from Evil, and for&s;aking it, come into a State of Grace and Favour with God again. And this will further appear by <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.15. 25. Where the Author exhorts to dili|gence <HI>le&s;t any Man fail of</HI> (or fall from) <HI>the Grace of God</HI>; therefore he thought it po&s;&s;ible to fall from true Grace; for the Grace of God is true Grace; otherwi&s;e that Exhortation had been needle&s;s And <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.4, 5.6. and 10.26, 29. with many more Scriptures, hold forth the &s;ame Doctrine very plainly. So that it is no <HI>&s;trange Doctrine,</HI> but a <HI>true Chri&s;tian Doctrine</HI>; but the contrary Doctrine, <HI>i. e. Once in Grace, and ever in Grace,</HI> is in|deed a very &s;trange Doctrine, and quite contrary to the whole Tenour of the Scrip|tures, from one end to the other, and to the Teachings of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles; for Chri&s;t Taught his Di&s;ciples to <HI>Watch and Pray, lea&s;t they should enter into Temp|tation,</HI> which would have been needle&s;s, had there been no danger; he al&s;o exhorted them to <HI>abide in him,</HI> and <HI>that his Word

might abide in them</HI>; and much more to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>But <HI>J. G.</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Whom God loves, he loves to the end.</HI> Very true, if they con|tinue in his Love, in his Fear, in his Doc|trine, <HI>John</HI> 15.4.6, 7, and none can pluck them out of his Hand, but if they for&s;ake him, he will for&s;ake them; for it is only tho&s;e that hold out to the end that &s;hall be &s;aved. Therefore it is good for all to be watchful and careful, even &s;uch as have attained to a good E&s;tate in Grace, and in the Love and Favour of God, and not be pre&s;umptuous, thinking it is impo&s;|&s;ible to fall away; for the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed it po&s;&s;ible for him, when he &s;aid <HI>I keep under my Body, and bring it into Sub|jection, le&s;t that by any means, when I have preached to others, I my &s;elf should be a ca&s;t away,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.27.

<P>His 7<HI>th Strange Doctrine,</HI> is, <HI>to hold that human Learning is not a nece&s;&s;ary Qualifi|cation for a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter.</HI></P>

Mini&s;ters, who had it not? For we read, that they were unlearned and ignorant Men, not only before they were called and &s;ent forth to be Mini&s;ters, but al&s;o after Chri&s;ts Re&s;urrection, as we may &s;ee <HI>Acts</HI> 4.13. So that they had not humane Learning in an ordinary, nor extraordinary Way nei|ther; for the pouring forth of the Holy Gho&s;t on them, <HI>Acts</HI> 2. was not humane Learning. So it is plain, God did not only imploy one Per&s;on without it, but many; and I cannot find that it was ever counted nece&s;&s;ary by Chri&s;t nor his Apo&s;tle, did not Chri&s;t &s;ay, <HI>I thank thee O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t hid the&s;e things from the Wi&s;e and Prudent, and ha&s;t revealed them unto Babes,</HI> Mat. 11.25. And did not <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ay, that <HI>God had made Foolish, the Wisdom of this World,</HI> and that the <HI>World by Wi&s;dom did not know God.</HI> Neither is it any Reflection on the Wi&s;dom of God, but much exalts it; and the contrary is rather a Reflection on the Wi&s;dom of God, as if he could not Quali|fie and fit his Mini&s;ters for his Work and Service, by his Holy Spirit, without being beholden to Men to teach them <HI>Hu|mane

Learning</HI>; yet we do not decry Hu|mane Learning altogether, for we know it is good and u&s;eful for many things, but not for making of Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters, for they mu&s;t be called, &s;ent forth, qualified and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Chri&s;t, or they can do no|thing; for &s;o <HI>Paul</HI> declares, he was made a Mini&s;ter; and although he had humane Learning before, yet he &s;lighted and di&s;pi|&s;ed it, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3 7, 8. <HI>Gal.</HI> 1.1.</P>
<P>His 8<HI>th &s;trange Doctrine</HI> is, <HI>for private Per&s;ons to hold it Lawful for them to preach and Admini&s;ter the Sacraments of the New-Te&s;tament.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> As to admini&s;tring the Sacraments, we pretend to no &s;uch thing, we not find|ing the Word <HI>Sacrament</HI> in all the Scrip|ture; neither do we find any command from Chri&s;t for his Mini&s;ters to Admini|&s;ter that which they now call <HI>Sacraments,</HI> nor any thing, like them; but for private Per&s;ons to preach the Go&s;pel, if by <HI>pri|vate Per&s;ons</HI> he means, &s;uch as are not train|ed up in Humane Learning and ordained by Men, (as I &s;uppo&s;e he does) then, I &s;ay, &s;uch may very Lawfully preach the Go&s;pel, provided they are commi&s;&s;ionated

So we have no need to give ex|traordinary Te&s;timonies and Confirmati|ons of it, to gratifie the vain minds of carnal Men, but we are willing to recom|mend our &s;elves to eveey Mans Con&s;cience, in the Sight of God, and to his Witne&s;s; and the Mea&s;ure of his Grace in all Men.</P>

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I am of the &s;ame Mind, and that it was foretold (as he &s;ays,) in the Apo&s;tles Days, and was then begun, and abundance did &s;pring up in the Time of the Apo&s;ta|cy from the true Faith, when the true Church was fled into the Wilderne&s;s for 1260 Days or Years, and many of tho&s;e <HI>Errors</HI> and <HI>Here&s;ies</HI> are &s;till held and plead|ed for by the &s;everal Sorts of profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians, who &s;ome of them pretend to much Reformation, and to be come out of the Wilderne&s;s, but it is but in part, and I de&s;ire that they may come further, even out of <HI>Babylon,</HI> and her Suburbs, and de|ny all her Merchandize. And I would have it be the great care of Gods People to &s;tand up in Defence of the Truths of the Go&s;pel, and to oppo&s;e Error where|ever they meet with it; and it is my concern at this Time, in this undertaking, to oppo&s;e, and expo&s;e the Errors I find in <HI>J.

they overcame the evil one, and by which their Hearts were purified and were made free from Sin, and became the Servants of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and brought forth Fruit un|to Holine&s;s; for <HI>if the Son make you free, then shall you be free indeed,</HI> John 8.36. but he that committeth Sin, is the Ser|vant of Sin, and &s;o not made free; and no wonder that &s;uch plead for Sin and a|gain&s;t Sinle&s;s perfection, and call the <HI>Doc|trine of Perfection</HI> a &s;trange Doctrine.</P>
<P>In page 44. <HI>J. G.</HI> &s;peaks of the Errors of the <HI>Antinomians, who,</HI> as he &s;ays, <HI>look upon them&s;elves above all Ordinances, and free from all Law,</HI> &amp;c. But this is nothing to us, we are no <HI>Antinomians,</HI> neither do we hold any &s;uch things as he there &s;ets down, for we &s;ubmit to all the <HI>Or|dinances of God and Chri&s;t,</HI> though not to the Inventions of Men, fal&s;ely called Or|dinances of Chri&s;t. We al&s;o &s;ubmit to the <HI>Ordinances and Laws of Men,</HI> either ac|tively or pa&s;&s;ively, and always have done &s;o.
