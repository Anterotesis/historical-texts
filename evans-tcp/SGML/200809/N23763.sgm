<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SEND herewith, a copy of the Treaty of Friend|&s;hip, Limits, and Navigation, concluded on the 27th of October la&s;t, between the United States and his Catholic Maje&s;ty. This treaty has been ratified by me, agreeably to the con&s;titution; and the ratification has been di&s;patched for Spain, where it will doubtle&s;s be immediately ratified by his Catholic Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>This early communication of the treaty with Spain has become nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e it is &s;tipulated, in the third article, that commi&s;&s;ioners, for running the boun|dary line between the territory of the United States and the Spani&s;h colonies of Ea&s;t and We&s;t Florida, &s;hall meet at the Natchez, before the expiration of &s;ix months from the ratification. And as that period will undoubt|edly arrive before the next meeting of Congre&s;s, the Hou&s;e will &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of making provi&s;ion, in their pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion, for the object here mentioned. It will al&s;o be nece&s;&s;ary to provide for the expen&s;e to be incur|red in executing the twenty-fir&s;t article of the treaty, to enable our fellow-citizens to obtain, with as little delay as po&s;&s;ible, compen&s;ation for the lo&s;&s;es they have &s;u&s;|tained by the capture of their ve&s;&s;els and cargoes by the &s;ubjects of his Catholic Maje&s;ty, during the late war be|tween France and Spain.</P>
<P>E&s;timates of the monies, nece&s;&s;ary to be provided, for the purpo&s;es of this and &s;everal other treaties with foreign nations and the Indian tribes will be laid before you by the proper department.</P>

<P>The two high contracting parties hoping that the good corre&s;pondence and friend&s;hip which happily reigns be|tween them, will be further increa&s;ed by this treaty, and that it will contribute to augment their pro&s;perity and opulence, will in future give to their mutual commerce all the exten&s;ion and favor which the advantages of both countries may require.</P>
