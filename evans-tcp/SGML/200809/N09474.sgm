<HEAD>A LETTER, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>REVEREND SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I heard you was writing in an&s;wer to me, in the heat of your &s;pirit, and that your papers had pa&s;&s;ed thro' Mr. Hopkins's hands, I did not expect a calm, fair, equitable examination of things, and I do not find it. 'Tis mo&s;t evident that you did not write under the influence of that wi&s;dom which is <HI>without partiality,</HI> but hearkened, a great deal too much, to the coun&s;els of the wi&s;dom which is of men; which has cau&s;ed you to wander far out of the way of truth, equity and honor, to my injury and your own hurt.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not point out and reprove all your faults in what you have written again&s;t me: that would &s;well this letter into a large volume: but &s;ome things I mu&s;t tell you. <HI>If thy brother tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t thee, tell him his fault.</HI>&mdash;A few things only, I briefly mention in the fir&s;t part, and ha&s;ten to your appendix.</P>
<P>You &s;ay (p. 19)
<Q>Does it not de&s;erve a &s;mile to &s;ee Mr. H. quoting Pre&s;ident Edwards's an&s;wer to Taylor, in confutation of my opinion?&mdash;He is &s;o fully of my &s;entiments on this head, that I am <HI>bold</HI> to &s;ay, Mr. H. never read him, or does not under|&s;tand him, or el&s;e <HI>injured his con&s;cience in quoting him.</HI></Q>
Neither of the&s;e is true, Doctor. I read that book many years &s;ince, and have now in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion a manu&s;cript, wrote A.D. 1762, in which I ob&s;erve &s;ome of that great man's doctrinal incon&s;i&s;tencies, and &s;hew the fal&s;hood and ab&s;urdity of his notion of per&s;onal identity, and of Adam and all his children being one <HI>complex moral per&s;on</HI> or <HI>moral whole.</HI> If you are di&s;po&s;ed to publi&s;h it, it is at your &s;ervice. It will enable you to judge whether I under&s;tand the book; and
<PB N="4" REF="012066_0003_0F899389334215E8">
perhaps may give you a clearer under&s;tanding of it&mdash;As to inju|ring my con&s;cience in quoting him, this is a wonderful thought, Doctor I quoted the&s;e words from you,
<Q>This contrariety to God is <HI>innate</HI> and <HI>interwoven</HI> with the very frame of our hearts.</Q>
and then added, 'Is this con&s;i&s;tent with Mr. Edwards's doctrine? He &s;ays,
<Q>There is not the lea&s;t need of &s;uppo&s;ing any evil quality <HI>infu&s;ed, implanted</HI> or <HI>wro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t into the nature</HI> of man, by any po&s;itive cau&s;e or influence whatever; or of &s;uppo&s;ing that man is conceived and born with a <HI>fountain of evil in his heart,</HI> &s;uch as is any thing properly <HI>po&s;itive,</HI> in order to account for a &s;inful corruption of nature.</Q>
See the Dialogue, p 15. I did not add one word more. In what was my con&s;cience injured in this? Was it in a&s;king that wicked que&s;tion? or in quoting the words? Are the words, or the doctrine they contain, wicked, and un|lawful to be tran&s;cribed? I believe, Doctor, all the fault lies in the direct oppo&s;ition of Mr. E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s doctrine, contained in the&s;e words, to yours, and this, you know, is not my fault, but yours, or his.</P>
<P>Speaking of the perver&s;e Jews, you &s;ay,
<Q>It was as difficult to per&s;uade them that they hated God, and were the children of Satan, as it is to per&s;uade Mr. H that carnal men naturally hate moral good, and <HI>perhaps for the &s;ame rea&s;on.</HI> When Chri&s;t told them they were the children of the devil, they in return, told him he had a devil; pretty much as Mr. H. has &s;erved me for &s;aying, <HI>man is turned devil.</HI></Q>
(p 25). 'Ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you, Sir, that intimate concerning me, that I have a devil; I bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t no &s;uch 'railing ac|cu&s;ation' again&s;t you. I mention this as one of the things by which you di&s;honor your&s;elf, both as a gentleman and a chri&s;tian, and of which you ought &s;eriou&s;ly to repent.</P>
<P>You &s;ay, in your &s;ermon (p 40.41, 2d edit.)
<Q>Sinners laugh at his (God's) coun&s;els and de&s;pi&s;e all his reproof; and <HI>&s;o they will do</HI> till the arm of God's power is revealed to make them willing [by creating them anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us]</Q>
I compared this with another pa&s;&s;age in your &s;ermon, viz
<Q>No moral argu|ments <HI>except</HI> the terrors of the Lord, are adapted to influence carnal &s;inners to attend to their &s;alvation,</Q>
and ob&s;erved the incon&s;i&s;tence. You now endeavor to reconcile your&s;elf with your&s;elf thus,
<Q>Where is the incon&s;i&s;tency? In both I &s;hew that no arguments of <HI>any hind</HI> are &s;ufficient to renew and reconcile carnal &s;inners to God. Yet I &s;ay, the terrors of the Lord are adapted to influence them to &s;eek deliverance from hell by working on their principle of &s;elf love&mdash;Is this hard to be un|der&s;tood?</Q>
<PB N="5" REF="012066_0003_0F899389334215E8">
No, Doctor, it is not. But it is hard to be under|&s;tood how the&s;e terrors &s;hould thus work on this principle, &s;o long as the &s;inner laughs at and de&s;pi&s;es them. You had better have &s;aid nothing. You mu&s;t give up one of the propo&s;itions: they will always quarrel.</P>
<P>You &s;ay (p. 46 of your &s;erm.)
<Q>A realizing view and percep|tion of the <HI>moral</HI> beauty and glory of God is that which is the motive that fir&s;t prevails with the [<HI>renewed</HI>] &s;inner to <HI>return</HI> and be <HI>reconciled</HI> to him.</Q>
In the note you &s;ay,
<Q>I a&s;k Mr. H's pardon for leaving out the word [<HI>renewed</HI>] which I have now in&s;erted.</Q>
You, Sir, had more need to a&s;k pardon for in&s;erting it now; which, had you done &s;o, I could not have granted, but upon the condition of your throwing it out again. The propo|&s;ition, as it &s;tood before was true, and as &s;uch I quoted it to your honor; but as it now &s;tands, it is fooli&s;h and ab&s;urd, and a mon|&s;ter which devours it&s;elf. The <HI>true</HI> and <HI>&s;criptural</HI> idea of a &s;in|ner <HI>renewed,</HI> is one morally changed, and conformed to God in the holine&s;s of his heart or prevailing temper. And thus you &s;ometimes de&s;cribe this renewal; I don't mean exactly in the&s;e words, but to the &s;ame &s;en&s;e. And yet you here repre&s;ent this renewal as affecting <HI>no &s;uch change.</HI> The renewed &s;inner, con&s;i|dered <HI>&s;imply as renewed,</HI> is not yet per&s;uaded
<Q>to return and be reconciled to God.</Q>
This is effected by a different, and after|work of the Spirit of God, giving the renewed &s;inner 'a realizing view,' and &s;o the &s;inner is renewed, and not renewed at the &s;ame time: for &s;uch a renewal of the &s;pirit of the mind as does not reconcile the man to God is <HI>nothing.</HI> Why, Doctor, do you &s;o trifle with, and abu&s;e &s;criptural terms &amp; phra&s;es? I don't mention this ab&s;urdity as peculiar to you, it is common to all who teach a phy&s;ical regeneration, without any influence from light and truth. But will numbers keep &s;uch ab&s;urdities in countenance?&mdash;Doc|tor, your &s;ermons need a third edition, with numerous additional corrections.</P>
<P>Now, Doctor, let us a little examine your Appendix. In do|ing which we &s;hall both have need of patience; I in &s;uffering your unju&s;t cen&s;ures, you in &s;uffering my ju&s;t vindication and apology.</P>
<P N="1">I. The fir&s;t thing I notice is your <HI>perver&s;e</HI> mi&s;repre&s;entation of my doctrine relating to the <HI>moral &s;en&s;e</HI> or <HI>ta&s;te</HI> natural and e&s;&s;ential to man as a moral agent, and to <HI>all</HI> moral agents, <HI>as &s;uch.</HI> You &s;ay 'Mr. Hart's&mdash;<HI>fundamental</HI> error, I take to be this,
<PB N="6" REF="012066_0004_0F89938ACF633580">
'viz. that all beings endowed with natural con&s;cience have ne|ce&s;&s;arily a ta&s;te for moral excellency, i. e. approve and LOVE <HI>that which appears to the under&s;tanding or con&s;cience to be morally good, and</HI> HATE <HI>what appears morally evil.</HI>' (p. 63, 64.) Here, Doctor, you repre&s;ent that approbation which <HI>rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>con&s;cience,</HI> or the <HI>moral &s;en&s;e</HI> gives to actions and characters morally good, when pre&s;ented to the mind in a <HI>true</HI> light (which I &s;pake of as <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to moral agents, <HI>as &s;uch</HI>) as the <HI>&s;ame</HI> with the <HI>love of the heart,</HI> or their being <HI>cho&s;en</HI> and <HI>embraced by the will</HI> in <HI>prefe|rence</HI> to all that &s;tands in competition with them.&mdash;I did not do &s;o, but kept the&s;e clearly di&s;tingui&s;hed. You might have per|ceived it if your mind had not been <HI>bia&s;ed</HI> by evil pa&s;&s;ions, unle&s;s your under&s;tanding is more defective than I have thought it.&mdash; This, Sir, is <HI>your fundamental error,</HI> or mi&s;take and blunder, and runs thro' all you have &s;aid upon this &s;ubject, to my injury, and to your own di&s;honor.</P>
<P>Quoting a pa&s;&s;age from my dialogue (p. 52) which concludes thus, 'On this,' i. e. on the moral faculty of di&s;cerning between moral good and evil, &amp;c.
<Q>is founded the principle and power of natural con&s;cience,</Q>
you paraphra&s;e or expound the words thus,
<Q>On this ready perception of the <HI>beauty</HI> of morally good, and <HI>hatefulne&s;s</HI> of morally evil objects, <HI>i. e.</HI> on a LOVE <HI>for holi|ne&s;s</HI> and HATRED <HI>of &s;in, is founded</HI> the principle and power of natural con&s;cience;</Q>
by which you certainly mean a <HI>gracious</HI> and <HI>holy love</HI> to &s;piritual things, and <HI>holy hatred</HI> of their contraries. (p. 65.) Doctor, if you thus e&s;&s;entially mi&s;repre&s;ented the ob|vious &s;en&s;e of my words, thro' weakne&s;s, I pity you; if you did it wilfully, which you have given great rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, the heavens frown upon you.</P>
<P>You go on in your way, and draw many dreadful con&s;equences from your fundamental blunder, which you charge upon me, and injuriou&s;ly lay them at my door; and by partial quotations, and perver&s;e con&s;tructions endeavor to fa&s;ten them on me: &s;ee your two fir&s;t &s;ections.&mdash;You &s;ay in particular,
<Q>Mr. H. be|lieves that unrenewed men <HI>&s;ee</HI> and LOVE virtue <HI>in its own light,</HI></Q>
(p. 70.)
<Q>He largely <HI>in&s;i&s;ts</HI> that moral beings <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> LOVE God and objects morally good or holy <HI>as &s;oon as they &s;ee them,</HI> and takes it for granted, again and again, that they can &s;ee them in a true light, as amiable and excellent, worthy of e&s;teem and honor, and are <HI>affected accordingly</HI>; that they <HI>cannot hate</HI> God, but when they view him as a <HI>morally evil</HI> and <HI>contemptible</HI> being.</Q>
<PB N="7" REF="012066_0004_0F89938ACF633580">
(p. 163.) This, Doctor, is your &s;hort &s;ummary of what you have been laboring to per&s;uade your readers I believe and teach, at the expence of almo&s;t an hundred pages, by a variety of partial quotations, arbitrary and artful mi&s;repre&s;entations, and fooli&s;h and perver&s;e rea&s;onings. But after all, you are only <HI>beering fal&s;e witne&s;s again&s;t your neighbour,</HI> as I &s;hall &s;hew you pre&s;ently. But fir&s;t, let us &s;ee what you tell your readers I believe, relating to the <HI>nature</HI> of the <HI>enmity</HI> of vicious beings to God.</P>
<P N="2">II. I will repre&s;ent the matter in your own words. You &s;ay,
<Q>He (Mr. H.) &s;hews his opinion to be this, that all men really <HI>love</HI> God's true character, and never <HI>hate</HI> him but when he is viewed by them in fal&s;e and odious colours;&mdash;and therefore that their <HI>hearts</HI> are <HI>right, holy</HI> and <HI>good,</HI></Q>
(p. 74.)
<Q>Are there not many</Q>
(beings)
<Q>who are allowed by all, except Mr. H. to be totally de&s;titute of true virtue or love to God, even all the devils? Mr. H. indeed &s;uppo&s;es that they do not, cannot hate God, con&s;idered in him&s;elf, but <HI>only</HI> a <HI>fal&s;e</HI> character of him, which is not God.&mdash;But whatever high opinion Mr. H. may have of the piety of devils,&mdash;I &s;hall take it for granted that devils are very wicked beings,</Q>
(p. 77.) They are indeed &s;o, Doctor; they abode not in the truth, and they fal&s;ely accu&s;e tho&s;e that do. God forbid that we &s;hould be like them.&mdash;You &s;ay you 'could fill whole pages to &s;hew that Mr. Hart con&s;iders this en|mity 'to God as a <HI>very trifling</HI> evil, (93) No, Doctor, you can't produce one pa&s;&s;age that intimates any &s;uch thing; but might have quoted many which &s;hew the contrary.</P>
<P>Plea&s;e to turn your eye on your 90, 91, 92 and 93 pag.&mdash; You will there &s;ee &s;uch an in&s;tance of unju&s;t and infamous mi&s;re|pre&s;entation, and ill bred perver&s;ene&s;s as is &s;carcely to be equal|led by the whole &s;ociety of Je&s;uits. Doctor, is not this para|graph like the young prophet's ax? I have good rea&s;on to think it is, and &s;everal others.</P>
<P>Doctor, you repre&s;ent this as my doctrine,
<Q>It is not the <HI>true,</HI> but a <HI>fal&s;e</HI> God, a <HI>morally evil</HI> or <HI>&s;inful</HI> being, that they</Q>
(wicked men)
<Q>always, <HI>univer&s;ally hate,</HI> and that <HI>becau&s;e</HI> he appears to them <HI>wicked,</HI> and as acting contrary to the moral law, which they naturally approve. And therefore it is <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> for them to <HI>hate</HI> the <HI>true</HI> God.&mdash;By Mr. H's own account, there is no need that the &s;pirit of enmity &s;hould be mortified, and a better and holy temper introduced into the heart</Q>
(of the carnal men)
<Q>becau&s;e the temper is <HI>already holy,</HI> and needs nothing to remove
<PB N="8" REF="012066_0005_0F89938B72E4ABD8">
its enmity to God, but ju&s;t <HI>&s;peculative</HI> notions of his character. This is Mr. H's notion of enmity to God, in a &s;hort view.</Q>
(p. 97.98) I could quote much more to this purpo&s;e, but the&s;e are &s;ufficient to give the reader an idea of the doctrine you charge, and endeavor to fa&s;ten upon me.</P>
<P N="3">III. Let us now &s;earch the Dialogue that we may &s;ee whether the&s;e things are &s;o, or are only <HI>fal&s;e</HI> and <HI>railing accu&s;ations</HI> which you have bro't again&s;t your brother.&mdash;Doctor, I de&s;ire you will attend with a good and hone&s;t heart, willing to &s;ee things as they really are.&mdash;I &s;aid,
<Q>There is in man a natural faculty whereby he is rendered capable of di&s;cerning and di&s;tingui&s;hing between moral good and evil&mdash;and readily perceives the one to be <HI>right, amiable,</HI> and <HI>worthy</HI> of <HI>e&s;teem</HI> and <HI>honor</HI>; the other <HI>wrong, hate|ful,</HI> and <HI>blame-worthy</HI>&mdash;as &s;oon as the&s;e objects are &s;een by the mind in their <HI>true</HI> light, or as being what they really are, without any further rea&s;oning about them,</Q>
(D p 52)&mdash; This, Doctor, you have repre&s;ented as implying a <HI>holy love</HI> to the one, and hatred to the other: but &s;uffer me to a&s;k you a few que&s;tions. What are characters and actions morally good <HI>in them&s;elves?</HI> Are they not <HI>really</HI> right, amiable, worthy of e&s;teem and honor? Are not their contraries really wrong, hateful, blame-worthy? If the mind &s;ees the&s;e objects as 'being what they are,' does &s;he not perceive them to be &s;o, i. e. to be what &s;he &s;ees them to be? And if the mind perceives the morally good to be right, &amp;c. and the morally evil to be wrong, &amp;c. does &s;he not, in this view of them, in her judgment and con&s;cience, approve the one as right, &amp;c. and becau&s;e it is &s;o, and di&s;approve the other as wrong, &amp;c. and becau&s;e it is &s;o? Does not the natural &s;en&s;e pronounce this right judgment concerning them? Can the mind, at the &s;ame time, approve a morally good action or cha|racter as being right and becau&s;e it is right, and di&s;approve it be|cau&s;e it is right, or as being wrong? Or can &s;he approve that as right, which at the &s;ame time &s;he di&s;approves as wrong? Or can &s;he both approve and di&s;approve it becau&s;e &s;he &s;ees it to be wrong and blame-worthy?&mdash;If the heart hates and rejects that which the under&s;tanding and con&s;cience &s;ee and approve as right and worthy of e&s;teem, and loves and chu&s;es that which the&s;e &s;ee to be wrong, blame-worthy, and proper objects of moral ha|tred, and di&s;approve as &s;uch; (which is often the ca&s;e) does the heart thus counteract the con&s;cience and moral &s;en&s;e, from the <HI>&s;ame views</HI> of the objects, which determine the judgment of
<PB N="9" REF="012066_0005_0F89938B72E4ABD8">
the con&s;cience? Is it not becau&s;e the heart is <HI>intere&s;ted</HI> and rendered partial and perver&s;e by her attachment to particular lu&s;ts, the indulgence whereof is incon&s;i&s;tent with moral truth and right, and for the &s;ake of which, as be&s;t beloved, &s;he hates and rejects the truth and right, embraces the evil and wrong? The mind approves the moral truth, viewing it as it is in it&s;elf, the heart rejects and hates it, <HI>relatively</HI> con&s;idered, or as oppo&s;ing her lu&s;ts, from intere&s;ted views. When this is the ca&s;e, is not the man condemned of him&s;elf, in that which he allows in heart and practice? Does he not act incon&s;i&s;tently with him&s;elf, as well as with the rule of right, and do violence to the moral con|&s;titution of his nature? When Judas betrayed his Ma&s;ter, did he not act from the heart, under the influence of covetou&s;ne&s;s and fooli&s;h re&s;entment, in oppo&s;ition to his judgment or con&s;cience? And when he afterwards &s;aid,
<Q>I have &s;inned in that I have be|trayed innocent blood,</Q>
did he not &s;peak the language of the moral &s;en&s;e? Do you think, Doctor, that he now di&s;covered any thing of a &s;piritual ta&s;te or holy temper of heart? Peter was an accurate divine. He &s;ays,
<Q>Balaam loved the <HI>wages</HI> of unrigh|teou&s;ne&s;s</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. 2.15.</NOTE>
For the &s;ake of the&s;e he for&s;ook the right way, knowing of it &s;uch, and went a&s;tray in the ways of unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s. And the apo&s;tle Jude &s;peaking of &s;ome chri&s;tian apo&s;tates, &s;ays,
<Q>They have ran greedily after the error of Balaam <HI>for re|ward.</HI></Q>
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jude 11.</NOTE> This Balaam for&s;ook the right way, and went a&s;tray in the way of error and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, with his eyes open. Was it becau&s;e the way of error and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s appeared to him a more excellent, or amiable and plea&s;ant way, <HI>in it&s;elf, &s;imply con|&s;idered as &s;uch,</HI> than the contrary way? Was it becau&s;e he hated right and loved wrong for its own &s;ake? Your doctrine &s;ays it was: but you &s;ee Peter and Jude have decided the ca&s;e again&s;t you. This wicked man <HI>loved</HI> the <HI>wages</HI> of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, and ran in that way as <HI>greedy</HI> of the <HI>reward</HI> of iniquity. Was not his hatred of the right way and love of the wrong, an <HI>intere&s;ted</HI> and <HI>partial</HI> af|fection, a <HI>&s;econdary</HI> pa&s;&s;ion, a <HI>con&s;equence</HI> and <HI>re&s;ult</HI> of his love and greedy de&s;ire of the reward?</P>
<P>Doctor, think enough to an&s;wer all the&s;e que&s;tions right; and then read over the &s;econd part of my dialogue again, with perfect calmne&s;s, not in the &s;pirit of a perver&s;e di&s;puter of this world, intere&s;ted in mi&s;repre&s;enting its &s;en&s;e, but as an impartial, upright judge, as under his eye who &s;ees all the artful windings of the

<P>In my account of the moral &s;en&s;e natural and e&s;&s;ential to man as a moral agent, you think you find
<Q>a good definition of a &s;pi|ritual ta&s;te,</Q>
or holy love to &s;piritual good: But in this you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r. That approbation which rea&s;on and the moral &s;en&s;e give to things morally good, which I &s;pake of, as quoted above, is not the &s;ame thing with a &s;upreme love and preferring choice of them by the heart; which is e&s;&s;ential to true virtue. The fir&s;t may exi&s;t while the other does not; which is often the ca&s;e with men. You &s;ay to this purpo&s;e, that this approving perception of the mind implies true love of the heart, or at lea&s;t nece&s;&s;arily draws it. But you are mi&s;taken in this. The approbation of con&s;cience or of the moral &s;en&s;e, and the ruling affection and choice of the heart, are frequently as far a&s;under, in &s;inful beings, as the city of God and the kingdom of Satan.&mdash; You al&s;o &s;ay to this purpo&s;e, that no natural man can &s;ee things morally good in a <HI>true</HI> light, or perceive their moral amlablene&s;s and excellence; and &s;o &s;ays the writer of the notes in your appendix. I will allow you two things, Doctor; fir&s;t, that men mu&s;t have the&s;e things pre&s;ented to their view by God's teaching, before they can perceive their moral excellence. Secondly, that natural men can't &s;ee them in &s;o clear and <HI>realizing</HI> a light as holy men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o, and yet re|main carnal: but they may have their under&s;tanding &s;o far en|lightned, as to &s;ee them to be right, amiable in them&s;elves, and worthy of e&s;teem and honor, and approve them as &s;uch, and yet their heart be pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ingaged, and continue attached to other objects le&s;s worthy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;tent with the&s;e.

<P>Mr Edwards admits the di&s;tinction between the ta&s;te and ap|probation of moral good or true virtue, by the con&s;cience or mo|ral &s;en&s;e, and that by a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e. He freely owne that the mind of the unrenewed man, if duly inlightened, may &s;ee, and by the moral &s;en&s;e approve a real beauty, excellence and amiablene&s;s in true virtue. This indeed he calls a <HI>&s;econdary</HI> beauty, but &s;ays
<PB N="11" REF="012066_0006_0F89938C35CDAA98">
it belongs to moral things. This is not the le&s;s a real and true moral beauty becau&s;e he calls it a &s;econdary beauty. He was a great man, but not &s;o great as to alter the nature of things by a da&s;h of his pen; nor &s;o great as to be exempted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om the uni|ver&s;al infirmity.

<P>In the dialogue, p. 61, 62, you may find the&s;e words, viz.
<Q>I ob&s;erved above, that the enmity of &s;inful &s;ouls again&s;t God's true character is directed again&s;t it, only <HI>relatively</HI> con&s;idered, and is a <HI>&s;econdary</HI> pa&s;&s;ion, which ari&s;es in the heart in con&s;equence of men's indulgence of particular lu&s;ts, which fir&s;t lead them into a practical oppo&s;ition to the law and righteous will of God&punc; When the light of truth manife&s;ts their deeds to be evil and reproves them, and kindly calls them back into the right way, if they &s;ubmit to the reproof, and obey the merciful call, their oppo&s;ition to God cea&s;es, no <HI>higher</HI> enmity can ri&s;e in their hearts; their enmity is turned again&s;t their own lu&s;ts: but if they refu&s;e to receive reproof, and per&s;i&s;t in their &s;ins again&s;t light, the light becomes offen&s;ive, and they hate it as reproving them. <HI>The &s;corner hateth him that reproveth him.</HI></Q></P>

<Q><HI>This</HI> doctrine concerning the enmity of carnal men again&s;t God, is further confirm'd by this ob&s;ervation, which holds univer&s;ally true in fact, viz.

and ob&s;erve the u&s;e you make of what you venture to &s;how your readers&mdash;it may give an edifying blu&s;h &mdash; The things you have quoted, you &s;o artfully weave in with your own mi&s;re|pre&s;entations as to make them look a little favorable to them, to a carele&s;s reader.

<P>Let us examine another pa&s;&s;age which you have made great u&s;e of, and ob&s;erve how you have perverted and abu&s;ed it.

<Q>Since we are upon the melancholy &s;ubject of the enmity of poor &s;inners again&s;t God, I will ju&s;t mention one thing more.</Q></P>

There is order, in this confu&s;ion; the order of the governing truth and righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of God: it an&s;wers to the true nature of things, and in its way is prai&s;e to him.

<Q>I will point out a few things. Mr, H &s;uppo&s;es that the awakened, unrenewed &s;inner takes pains to become better,</Q>

<Q>Mr. H. &s;up|po&s;es that the awakened, unrenewed &s;inner, truly repents,</Q>

of awakened &s;inners under it, and both much alike. Why did you not act like hone&s;t men, and &s;tate my doctrine fairly, and if you had objections to it, offer them clearly? Another method plea&s;ed you better.&mdash;You, Doctor, mi&s;repre&s;ent and aggravate things to the utmo&s;t. You &s;ay,
<Q>Mr. H. &s;uppo&s;es that the awa|kened, unrenewed &s;inner grows <HI>better</HI> under conviction, and <HI>therefore</HI> is <HI>more likely</HI> to obtain mercy, and that there is <HI>no encou|ragement at all</HI> for &s;inners to &s;trive or hope, if this is not the ca&s;e.

<Q>Mr. H's rea&s;oning, p 30.&mdash;36, a|mounts to this, viz.

(p. 119)
<Q>The only way to keep &s;inners from di&s;couragement, and prompt them to&mdash;con&s;tancy in &s;eeking af|ter &s;alvation, is to per&s;uade them that they <HI>really grow better,</HI> and may hope, <HI>by their further increa&s;e in goodne&s;s,</HI> to obtain the favor they need,</Q>

(p 70) Yes Doctor, they &s;ometimes do, <HI>for the &s;ake of the profit</HI> and <HI>ad|vantage</HI> they make by it for the gratification of their lu&s;ts; as Balaam ran <HI>greedily</HI> after the <HI>wages</HI> of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.

<P>Doctor, you expre&s;s a de&s;ire to know what I mean by <HI>moral</HI> corruption. I mean by it a di&s;order o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> irregularity in the ten|dency, direction and exerci&s;e of the moral faculties and pa&s;&s;ions,

And if human nature is &s;o framed that men have naturally no <HI>capacity</HI> of <HI>&s;eeing</HI> any moral excellence, or of <HI>ta&s;ting</HI> any thing amiable and worthy of e&s;teem and honor in God's character, and in moral truth, be the mind ever &s;o much inlightened, but the&s;e objects appear ug|ly and <HI>hateful in them&s;elves</HI>; this is not a moral corruption, for which the man is blameable, but a phy&s;ical wrongne&s;s in the na|tural con&s;titution of human nature.

You add)
<Q>They may, and often do <HI>&s;ee</HI> tho&s;e perfections that compo&s;e that character that is beautiful <HI>in it&s;elf,</HI> &s;uch as his power, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &amp;c.&mdash;They &s;ee the <HI>true character</HI> of God,</Q>

<Q>for that which renders him beautiful to all holy beings, even that is the object of their hatred; and if &s;o, then the beauty of God's cha|racter is the thing they hate, (p. 69, note)</Q>

Whence is this, Doctor? You &s;ay &s;uch a fal&s;e ta&s;te and mon&s;trous hatred is interwove in the very frame of the heart of man, ever &s;ince the fall. Doctor, I mu&s;t tell you again,

You &s;ay this doctrine is as liable to the charge of con&s;equential bla&s;phemy again&s;t God and the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as yours; and that yours can be vindicated from this charge as ea&s;ily and fully as mine, p 110, 111.&mdash;Doctor, you labour under a very great mi&s;take in this. The go&s;pel is a mini&s;tration of &s;upernatural truth and grace, fitted in its nature to work in the mind as a vital &s;eed, and &s;acred leaven; and the mind of man is naturally capa|ble of being influenced and changed or &s;piritualized by it, when firmly believed and realized.

Their moral excellency con&s;i&s;ts in their being what they are. The beauty or moral excellency of God's character con&s;i&s;ts in, or is the re&s;ult of all moral and mental perfections, as united in him, and mo&s;t har|moniou&s;ly exerci&s;ed, <HI>all as one.</HI> This collection of moral and mental beauties, all in the highe&s;t perfection of their nature, forms a character, who&s;e light and glory fill the univer&s;e, and is the wonder and joy of all the &s;ons of wi&s;dom, in all worlds. <HI>Honor and maje&s;ty are before him: &s;trength and beauty are in his &s;anctuary.</HI></P>
<P>But you. Doctor, give us no di&s;tinct Ideas of what you mean by moral beauty, and the moral excellency of God's character: perhaps you have none.

And all your writers talk in the &s;ame &s;train. This, Doctor, is a downright contradiction: and you have no way to e&s;cape but by e&s;&s;entially changing the idea of moral beauty, and introducing a new and imaginary notion of moral excellency, and placing vir|tue on a fal&s;e foundation. This is what Mr. Edwards has done
<PB N="34" REF="012066_0018_0F899395F6EC4998">
in his di&s;&s;ertation on the nature of true virtue. Doubtle&s;s you have adopted his di&s;tinction between the <HI>primary</HI> and <HI>&s;econdary</HI> beauty of moral things and characters. The beauty I &s;pake of above, I &s;uppo&s;e you would call after him,
<Q>a <HI>&s;econdary</HI> beauty, altogether of the &s;ame kind with the beauty of a che&s;s board, or piece of beautifully &s;lower'd chints or brocade,</Q>
which, con&s;ider<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d &s;imply in it&s;elf, has nothing of the nature of true virtue and mo|ral beauty in it, any more than tho&s;e things have; and that you would &s;ay, all moral excellency, or true moral beauty con&s;i&s;ts in what he calls the <HI>primary</HI> beauty of moral things, which is intire|ly of a different nature or kind, and which no unregenerate man can &s;ee, which the moral &s;en&s;e can't ta&s;te, and has no reli&s;h for.</P>
<P>This I &s;uppo&s;e to be your &s;ecret meaning; tho' for &s;ome rea&s;on or other, you don't clearly explain your&s;elves. This is the key which explains your my&s;terious talk about &s;eeing the perfections and character of God without di&s;cerning any thing of their moral beauty or excellency. But I don't enlarge here, having parti|cularly examined the&s;e notions, and &s;hewn them to be arbitrary and fal&s;e, in my remarks on that piece of Mr. Edwards's.</P>
<P>You &s;ay, Doctor,
<Q>a perception of beauty is love, or <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> engages it.</Q>
No, it nece&s;&s;arily engages the mind to approve the object as amiable and <HI>worthy</HI> to be loved. Indeed the perception of the moral beauty of God's character may be &s;o full, clear and realizing as to draw the heart off from all its adulterous loves, and fix it on God. He can give &s;uch a &s;en&s;e. But the views men generally have of God's moral excellency and glory, are &s;o imperfect, ob&s;cure and unrealizing, that they don't draw the heart to the choice of him, in preference to all other objects of de&s;ire.</P>
<P N="9">IX. In your &s;eventh &s;ect. Doctor, I ob&s;erve you endeavor to per&s;uade your readers that my &s;cheme of doctrines agrees with Mr. Sandeman's.

<P>You mention Van Ma&s;tricht as one who ju&s;tifies your new doc|trines. I have &s;een the extracts from him lately publi&s;hed <HI>He clearly condemns you,</HI> Doctor. He &s;ays,
<Q>Regeneration is a &s;econd and &s;piritual generation, in which the &s;oul receives &s;piritual life. The father in this ca&s;e is God&mdash;the <HI>&s;eed</HI> is the <HI>word of God</HI>&mdash; received by the external call of the Go&s;pel,</Q>
(p. 17) Doctor, you &s;ay this &s;eed, thus received into the mind of the unregenerate, only inflames enmity again&s;t God; that this change is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ought without any influence of go&s;pel truth upon the heart. In this, you &s;ee your witne&s;s <HI>condemns</HI> you.

<Q>This &s;piritual life, which he calls the <HI>immediate effect</HI> of the generating act, animates the whole man, and all the &s;everal parts and faculties of him. &mdash; As it takes place in the <HI>under&s;tanding,</HI> it is called&mdash;&s;piritual <HI>light,</HI> and the be&s;towment of it <HI>by regeneration,</HI> is called <HI>illumination</HI>;&mdash; which light begets in them the <HI>&s;aving</HI> knowlege of God and the Me|diator,</Q>

<P>You Gentlemen, by the many quotations you have heaped up|on us, from former writers, have gained two things; fir&s;t, a proof that &s;ome great and good men before you have tho't ob&s;cure|ly, and talked incon&s;i&s;tently, as you al&s;o do.

<P N="11">XI.

Some others, I perceive, have been in doubt here.&mdash; To &s;atisfy you and them, I will tell you in a few words By moral power, force, &amp;c. I intend that kind of influence upon the mind, which is <HI>fitted, in its nature,</HI> to produce the de&s;igned <HI>moral</HI> effects or changes, motions or actions in the mind, as a moral agent. This, you will &s;ay, is too general: I will explain, only take the ideas already &s;ugge&s;ted, right.&mdash;There is a <HI>power</HI> in <HI>&s;trong</HI> delu&s;ions, an <HI>efficacy</HI> and <HI>energy</HI> in the &s;pirit of error upon minds prepared to receive it: but it is not of the <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> kind.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 The&s;. 2.9&mdash;11.</NOTE> And there is a divine <HI>power</HI> in &s;acred truth, and a <HI>mighty</HI> acting <HI>force</HI> and <HI>energy</HI> in divine beauty and love, as applying them&s;elves to, or exerting their power upon the mind.

<P>I will now con&s;ider the <HI>moral</HI> power and energy of the holy Spirit, exerted in morally changing and turning the heart of the &s;inner from his &s;in unto God, or regenerating him. He applies him&s;elf to him, for this purpo&s;e, in a manner &s;uited to his nature as a <HI>moral</HI> being: He pre&s;ents the quickning truth

<P>Doctor, to talk of a moral change, wro't by a phy&s;ical operati|on, as <HI>preceeding</HI> all this, and preparing the heart to be influenced by the truth and pre&s;ence of God in the mind, as you gentlemen do, is to tell of a moral change <HI>preceeding it&s;elf,</HI> or of a moral change which leaves the <HI>under&s;tanding, will</HI> and <HI>moral pa&s;&s;ions un|changed, unaffected</HI> not <HI>touched</HI> or <HI>moved</HI> at all; which is no <HI>moral</HI> change. Motives pre&s;ented to the view of the mind, Mr. Ed|wards &s;ays, are what move the will, and that without the influ|ence of motives, the will can't act or chu&s;e any thing, one way of another.

motive to holy volition, to the view of the mind, can't then pro|duce a moral change in the heart, or give a new, holy turn and di&s;po&s;ition to the will and moral pa&s;&s;ions, any more than motives, or moral force can wind up a watch that is run down, and give it new motion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I ob&s;erve, Doctor, you &s;ay,

<P>I mu&s;t take a little notice of one thing more, before I di&s;mi&s;s this &s;ubject. I ob&s;erved in the dialogu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> (p. 45, note) that
<Q>power may be di&s;tingui&s;hed into two kinds, <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> and <HI>moral,</HI> that the Spirit of God is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of both, and exerts the one or the other, as he wills to produce a change of the moral or phy&s;ical kind</Q>
Upon this you &s;ay,
<Q>Did ever any one be&s;ides Mr. H. <HI>imagine that the &s;ame almighty power could not produce effects of entirely different natures?</HI></Q>
(No, Doctor, nor he neither.
<Q>Did not the &s;ame power produce fire and water, the &s;ouls and bodies of men?</Q>
(p. 135) Yes, Doctor, it did. But what is all this to the purpo&s;e? The&s;e are, none of them, effects of the moral kind, in the &s;en&s;e of the phra&s;e as I u&s;ed it. And be&s;ides, you mi&s;take about the di&s;tinction of power, into moral and phy&s;ical. The di&s;tinction don't lie in the degrees of &s;trength.

I think you could not but know it to be &s;o; for you quoted the words immediately preceeding this clau&s;e and certainly you have &s;en&s;e enough to &s;ee the oppo&s;ition between your propo&s;ition and mine: It is a very injurious fal&s;hood &mdash; I could mention a great number of in&s;tances wherein you are guilty of the &s;ame kind of &s;in.

<P>Now, Doctor, a word or two upon the la&s;t clau&s;e quoted above, viz.
<Q>And becau&s;e &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s is <HI>innate,</HI> therefore this enmity is &s;o too.</Q>
In this you make this enmity, not a <HI>primary</HI> or <HI>original</HI> pa&s;&s;ion of human nature, but a <HI>&s;econdary</HI> pa&s;&s;ion only, a <HI>con&s;e|quence</HI> and <HI>re&s;ult</HI> of one particular wrong affection, <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s</HI>; you make it &s;o in the order of nature at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>By <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e, Doctor, you mean more than &s;elf-love, or a general de&s;ire of our own good and happine&s;s. I pre&s;ume you mean by it a vicious and irregular direction and exerci&s;e of the natural pa&s;&s;ion of love to our&s;elves or de&s;ire of our own good; a &s;etting up &s;elf as the &s;upreme object of our regard, &s;ub|ordinating God's intere&s;t and honor to &s;elf, and &s;uch a fooli&s;h re|gard to little &s;elf as di&s;po&s;es to trample upon truth, equity and honor, for the &s;ake of little and fal&s;e &s;elf intere&s;ts. If this is what you mean by <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s,</HI> it is a very vicious pa&s;&s;ion; and enmity to tho&s;e per&s;ons and things that &s;tand in its way, very ea&s;ily and naturally ari&s;es out of it. And when this mon&s;ter is provoked, he lays about him with fury: no weapon comes ami&s;s to him by which he may offend the objects of his hatred, and defend and avenge <HI>dear &s;elf.</HI> Hence come wars and fightings, reviling, lying, cur&s;ing, bla&s;phemy, or giving fal&s;e and injurious characters. This was the true &s;ource of all the malicious fal&s;hoods &s;poken again&s;t our Saviour and his apo&s;tles. And he foretells that the &s;ame &s;pirit which called the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bub will call tho&s;e of his hou&s;hold &s;o.&mdash; But you are mi&s;taken. Doctor, if you think all this <HI>innate.</HI> The general pa&s;&s;ion, or principle of &s;elf love or de&s;ire of our own good is indeed &s;o. But this, in it|&s;elf, &s;imply con&s;idered, is not evil; the wrong direction, and ir|regular and exce&s;&s;ive motions of it, only are &s;o. This is the effect of the wrong ideas and imaginations we receive, and the wrong judgments we make concerning our&s;elves and our own good and intere&s;t after we come upon the &s;tage. Indeed, if man is left to him&s;elf he will infallibly be mi&s;led his natural p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ions will take a wrong direction, and fix on wrong objects: he will be corrupt, wicked and mi&s;erable. Nothing but the teaching, &s;pirit and grace of God can prevent this, and guide the young creature right, and give a right direction to the natural pa&s;&s;ions, and fix them on their proper objects.</P>

&mdash;Doctor, your advice comes too late. I read that book many years ago, and have re-examined it lately. There are &s;ome good things in it, and &s;ome very wrong. I have made &s;ome remarks upon it, &s;hewing the fal&s;hood, and de&s;tructive tendency of &s;ome of his doctrines. You may publi&s;h this, with the other, if you plea&s;e, it may po&s;&s;ibly enlighten you a little.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. In your po&s;t&s;cript, Doctor, you take notice of my letter to Mr. Hopkins, and treat it as you did the dialogue, and by par|tial quotations and wrong repre&s;entations, attempt to deceive your readers, and to &s;et the D and L. a quarrelling. I will give you two in&s;tances. You quote me as &s;aying in the Letter,
<Q>Men who admit this doctrine</Q>
(i. e. of total depravity)
<Q>do and may very con&s;i&s;tently deny <HI>your</HI> doctrine concerning the <HI>nature</HI> of the enmity. There is an e&s;&s;ential difference between your doctrine concerning the nature of the enmity, and their doctrine of the corruption.</Q>
&mdash;On this you &s;ay,
<Q>But it &s;eems that he ex|pects us to believe this on his <HI>naked a&s;&s;ertion</HI>; for he has been <HI>very careful not to &s;hew wherein</HI> the di&s;tinction lies, unle&s;s we may gather it from the&s;e words;</Q>
<Q><HI>They</HI> (i e. all &s;ound Calvini&s;ts) <HI>believe the corruption is of the moral kind.</HI> But this &s;hews no difference; becau&s;e&mdash;we believe the enmity we hold to be of the moral kind</Q>
(p. 160) Here, Doctor, you have played <HI>foul</HI> in a very <HI>&s;candalous</HI> manner You have de&s;ignedly concealed from your reader the chief difference I mentioned between your doc|trine concerning the <HI>nature</HI> of the enmity and their doctrine con|cerning the corruption, and told him I mentioned no other diffe|rence but what you quoted, knowing you did not &s;peak true in this I here give the pa&s;&s;age as it &s;tands in my Letter, p. 7, and put the words you concealed, in Italics. Let the reader compare and judge for him&s;elf. 'Men who admit this doctrine' (of total depravity)
<Q>do, and may very con&s;i&s;tently deny your doctrine concerning the nature of the enmity: <HI>for</HI> they believe the cor|ruption is of the moral kind; <HI>and</HI> CURABLE <HI>by an application of that &s;upernatural doctrine of truth and grace which came by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in &s;uch a manner as the Spirit of God knows how to apply it.</HI> There is an e&s;&s;ential difference between your doctrine concern|ing the enmity&mdash;and their doctrine of the corruption.</Q>
&mdash; You know, Doctor, this difference, which you bid under a <HI>cover|ing</HI> &mdash;is <HI>real</HI> and <HI>e&s;&s;ential.</HI> You and Mr. Hopkins a&s;&s;ert the direct contrary concerning the nature of your enmity, viz that <HI>it is not curable</HI> by any po&s;&s;ible application of go&s;pel truth to the mind. By concealing this mentioned difference, and telling your readers
<PB N="46" REF="012066_0024_0F89939BB2419DA8">
I have 'been very careful not to &s;hew wherein the difference lies, 'except only by &s;aying,
<Q>they believe the corruption is on a moral kind.</Q>
You have given them ju&s;t cau&s;e to complain of you and &s;ay, 'thou ha&s;t unworthily deceived us.'</P>
<P>In my letter to Mr. Hopkins, I told him he had put the con|trover&s;y on a wrong foot in &s;aying that total depravity is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y the <HI>only thing in di&s;pute</HI>; that what I oppo&s;ed was your doctrine concerning the <HI>nature</HI> of the enmity&mdash;and gave this ju&s;t &s;ummary of it, viz.
<Q>The enmity of man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s heart is levelled <HI>directly again&s;t God's whole moral character,</HI> as being hateful to the natural man, <HI>in it&s;elf</HI> or <HI>for its own &s;ake;</HI> that this enmity is <HI>wro't into the very frame</HI> of the human heart, and is of &s;uch a nature, and &s;o con|firmed a principle that no <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> applications of <HI>go&s;pel truths</HI> to the mind and heart can <HI>&s;ubdue</HI> or <HI>weaken</HI> it: the Spirit of God him&s;elf can't overcome it by applying go&s;pel truth and the doctrines of grace to the heart: But, on the contrary the more a natural man <HI>&s;ees</HI> of the light and truth of God's character <HI>the more in proportion</HI> does his hatred of it ri&s;e and exert it&s;elf</Q>
&mdash; This doctrine I oppo&s;ed in my dialogue, and did &s;o effectually overthrow, that you and Mr Hopkins both have tho't it expedi|ent to &s;hift the controver&s;y, and tell your readers the di&s;pute is about the doctrine of total corruption. And you have underta|ken to prove that you have &s;tated the controver&s;y right, and that I &s;hamefully denied the truth of fact in telling Mr. Hopkins he had &s;tated it wrong. Let us &s;ee how you do this.</P>
<P>Having quoted two pa&s;&s;ages from the dialogue, and made an impertinent remark, mi&s;repre&s;enting their &s;en&s;e, you add,
<Q>I could fill whole pages with quotations of this kind</Q>
(i e with quotations not at all to your purpo&s;e)
<Q>but &s;hall only mention one more, where he <HI>expre&s;ly</HI> puts the controver&s;y <HI>upon the foot of total depravity.</HI> Having quoted from my &s;ermon the following words, viz. The minds of men are <HI>too full</HI> of enmity to be per|&s;uaded to love or be reconciled to God, by any, tho' the mo&s;t powerful arguments; therefore I do not think that regene|ration is effected by light,&mdash;but in order to this the power of God mu&s;t be exerted, and by this alone men are created anew; he adds, <HI>if the premi&s;es are true, the inference is undoubtedly ju&s;t.</HI> And yet in the face of all this&mdash;he te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ls Mr Hopkins that it is an unwarrantable a&s;&s;ertion to &s;ay, the controver&s;y does, by his (Mr. H's) own acknowlegement, turn upon the doctrine of man's <HI>total</HI> corruption.</Q>
(p. 159) More <HI>&s;oul play,</HI> Doctor, <HI>exceeding &s;oul.</HI> What I called the <HI>premi&s;es,</HI> in the pa&s;&s;age you refer to, you have concealed from your readers, and took the inference, your
<PB N="47" REF="012066_0024_0F89939BB2419DA8">
own inference, and tore it into two pieces and &s;et up one for the <HI>premi&s;e,</HI> and call the other the inference from it. By this won|derful contrivance you endeavor to deceive your readers, into a belief that I did really have the controver&s;y as you and Mr. Hop|kins &s;ay, and that I was guilty of palpable fal&s;hood in denying it to him.</P>
<P>I don't expect the reader to believe this charge without evi|dence of its truth; and therefore mu&s;t tran&s;cribe that pa&s;&s;age in the dialogue you refer to. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is in the 25th page.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Gent</HI> The Dr lays it down as a ju&s;t inference <HI>from what he had &s;aid</HI> BEFORE <HI>concerning the</HI> NATURE <HI>and power of the enmity of man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s heart again&s;t the nature and moral character of God,</HI> that men are not converted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o God by moral &s;ua&s;ion. i e. by any ra|tional arguments, whereby then hearts are influenced to turn from &s;in to God.</Q>
(Ser. p 52 1&s;t edit) This, Doctor, is the inference you draw from the doctrine concerning the <HI>nature</HI> and power of the enmity again&s;t God, which you had before laid down in the <HI>doctrinal part</HI> of your di&s;cour&s;e. It is the <HI>head</HI> pro|po&s;ition in your &s;econd remark, by way of inference from your doctrine concerning the enmity; a &s;ummary whereof I gave you ju&s;t now.&mdash;The <HI>Gent.</HI> quoted &s;ome others of your words, in your di&s;cour&s;e under this head, in which you expre&s;t this inference more &s;trongly:
<Q>The minds of men are too full of enmity to God, to be per&s;uaded to love and be reconciled to him by any, tho' the mo&s;t powerful arguments, addre&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d to their under&s;tanding or affections; therefore I don't think that regeneration is effected by light, i. e. by pre&s;enting the things of religion to their minds, or even by opening their eyes to &s;ee them; but in order to this the power of God mu&s;t be exerted, and by this alone men are created anew.</Q>
(p 53. 1&s;t edit.) Your inference from your doc|trine concerning the <HI>nature</HI> and power of in wro't enmity, before laid down in the body of your &s;ermon, being now fairly given in your own words, the <HI>Clerg</HI> rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies.
<Q>If the <HI>premi&s;es</HI> are true, the <HI>inference</HI> is undoubtedly ju&s;t.</Q>
By the <HI>premi&s;es</HI> he evidently and certainly means what you had before &s;aid in the body of your di&s;cour&s;e concerning the nature and power of the enmity; from which the <HI>Gent.</HI> &s;aid you drew the inference.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o ob&s;erved your efforts to clear your &s;cheme of doc|trine from the bad con&s;equences I charged upon it But they ju&s;tly lie at the door, and always will: I could ea&s;ily &s;hew the utter in&s;ufficiency of your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nings for this purpo&s;e: But I may not now tre&s;pa&s;s further upon the readers patience, by going into a critical examination of them. If he is judicious, unbia&s;&s;ed and

furni&s;hed with knowlege, he will readily perceive the weakne&s;s of your defence. I don't mean here to intimate any thing di&s;honorable to your under&s;tanding, Doctor The weakne&s;s lies in the cau&s;e you have e&s;pou&s;ed. Error can't be defended with real &s;trength, no, not by an angel. Good angels will never un|dertake its defence. I wi&s;h you would give it up, and leave the doctrine of errors to be defended by tho&s;e to whom they properly belong. What have we to do with them? Our honor is con|nected with the truth: on the contrary &s;ide we gain nothing but &s;hame: victory there, over the weak and credulous, is it fa|my and confu&s;ion. <HI>The deceived and deceiver are his, and du&s;t &s;hall be the &s;erpent's food</HI></P>
<P N="14">XIV. The critici&s;ms, Doctor, by which you endeavour to evade the force of the texts I mentioned as incon&s;i&s;tent with your doctrine, are &s;o manife&s;tly impertinent as not to need a particular an&s;wer. I only mention two, as a &s;pecimen of your &s;kill, and the liberty you take in evading the te&s;timony of the truth it&s;elf. But I mu&s;t ob&s;erve one thing you &s;ay ju&s;t before you come to re|mark on them.</P>
<P>'He' (Mr. H)
<Q><HI>&s;uppo&s;es</HI> that <HI>becau&s;e</HI> the word is called <HI>the &s;word of the Spirit, it has power to regenerate</HI> But has a &s;word any power at all?&mdash;The written word has no power but what ari|&s;es from the <HI>energy of the Spirit</HI> or the te&s;timony of con&s;cience.</Q>
(p 125.) Doctor, you know very well that I did not &s;uppo&s;e what you here &s;ugge&s;t, but &s;pake repeatedly of the holy Spirit acting upon the mind with the word, in producing this change, and expre&s;&s;ed my &s;entiments very fully that the outward teaching of the written word, without his concurring influence, can't ef|fect this holy change. In the place you refer to, where I call the word of God the &s;word of the Spirit, I &s;pake of the Spirit as the agent u&s;ing this &s;word. See the pages refered to below <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D. p 42, 45, 46, 58.</NOTE> This very phra&s;e, '<HI>the energy of the Spirit</HI>' accompanying the word, which you here u&s;e in a pretended oppo&s;ition to me, you found in my dialogue. You repeatedly own what I here repre&s;ent as my doctrine, to be indeed &s;o. You &s;ay, p. 111, 'He' (Mr. H)
<Q>owns that men neither will nor can be influenced to believe &s;a|vingly, by the mo&s;t powerful go&s;pel motives, without the powerful energy of the Spirit.</Q>
And in p. 113, you &s;ay,
<Q>We agree that the motives have no power till the Spirit exerts &s;ome kind of energy, &s;o that their efficacy is only with, and never without it.&mdash;We agree in this</Q>
Thus. Doctor you have borne witne&s;s again&s;t your&s;elf, that you te&s;tified a known fal&s;hood in the pa&s;|&s;age now under cen&s;ure. Why will you kill your&s;elf in order to
<PB N="49" REF="012066_0025_0F89939BF4895358">
throw fal&s;e reproach upon me? In&s;tances of the &s;ame kind are numerous. You have given full evidence that you are worthy of <HI>no credit</HI> as a witne&s;s again&s;t me.</P>
<P>I now proceed to ob&s;erve how you evade two of the texts I mentioned as evidence that God u&s;es and applies the go&s;pel truth to the mind in renewing or regenerating men.&mdash;I mentioned this text for this purpo&s;e, <HI>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth,</HI> (Jam. 1.18) On this you &s;ay,
<Q>But in order to make this &s;erve his turn, he mu&s;t prove that the word <HI>begat</HI> means regeneration properly taken for the implanting or creating a divine principle in the heart, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from active con|ver&s;ion, or the exerci&s;e of the new principle when given: till this is proved the text can't help his cau&s;e,</Q>
(p. 126) When it is, you hereby own that it will. I &s;hould have thought this needed no proof. For what you call
<Q>active conver&s;ion, or the exerci&s;e of the new principle,</Q>
is the act of the man, not of God as a generator, a con&s;equence or fruit of the work of God in be|getting or forming him a new creature: and &s;o I think you al|ways repre&s;ent it except here to avoid the force of this text.&mdash; Doctor, when you &s;ee a child exerci&s;ing the life and power he is endowed with, you don't &s;ay his father begat the&s;e exerci&s;es, but that he begat the child, and the child does the actions.&mdash; The holy Gho&s;t &s;peaketh expre&s;ly, and in a very determinate manner, as fore&s;eeing and guarding again&s;t this perver&s;ion of his words in favor of your corrupt doctrines.
<Q>Of his own will <HI>begat</HI> he <HI>us</HI> with the word of truth, that <HI>we</HI> &s;hould be a kind of <HI>fir&s;t fruits of his creatures,</HI></Q>
i. e. in the new creation: Behold, &s;aith the Lord, <HI>I create all things new</HI> The &s;ouls of men are created anew, renewed in knowlege, after God's image. He hath begot|ten <HI>us;</HI> not our actions of the new and holy kind, but <HI>our&s;elves. We</HI> are new begotten by God, and &s;o new born and his children: can the &s;en&s;e of words be more obvious and fixed? So it is &s;aid, God's people &s;hall be <HI>trees of righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Lord's plant|ing:</HI> and our Saviour &s;ays, <HI>make the tree good that his fruit may be good.</HI> God makes the tree good, a tree of righteou&s;ne&s;s; which re&s;pects the moral change of the mind and heart in regeneration or conver&s;ion; in con&s;equence of which the tree bears good fruit.</P>
<P>But you &s;ay,
<Q>The Greek word <HI>(apekue&s;e)</HI> rendered <HI>begat,</HI> may&mdash;be rendered <HI>impregnated</HI>; and &s;o Dr Doddridge renders it&mdash;and this is the mo&s;t natural meaning of the word in the 15th ver. Sin when it is fini&s;hed or <HI>perpetrate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> bringeth forth, or rather is <HI>impregnated</HI> with death.</Q>
Doctor, &s;in is here figu|ratively repre&s;ented as a mother, and death as her on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pring.
<PB N="50" REF="012066_0026_0F89939CB86A3AF0">
Now a mother conceives feed, is impregnated, is pregnant, and brings forth her children. But where did you ever hear it &s;aid that the father in the act of begetting impregnates the child? This word as re&s;pecting the father's act as a generator is rightly rendered <HI>beget,</HI> and can't be rendered <HI>impregnated,</HI> in re&s;pect to the child begotten, without the greate&s;t ab&s;urdity. In this text we our&s;elves are repre&s;ented, not as a mother impregnated, but as the creatures or children <HI>begotten.</HI></P>
<P>I only mention one thing more. You &s;eem to think our Lord's parable of the &s;ower affords prooff that regeneration, or the ma|king the heart good and hone&s;t, is wro't by a mere phy&s;ical pow|er or operation, without any influence of go&s;pel truth in the heart. (p. 127) Your rea&s;oning on this parable is not good: it does not favor your cau&s;e Our Lord's manife&s;t de&s;ign in this parable, is to point out the cau&s;es of the go&s;pel's not producing the fruit of a holy and good life in &s;o many who hear it, viz. the lu&s;ts of their hearts which they will not part with; and to &s;hew that if men are of a good and hone&s;t heart, they will, by the mini&s;tration of the go&s;pel to them, be rendered fruitful in the righteous fruits of a good and chri&s;tian life. He &s;ays nothing here how the heart is made good. Parables will not endure to be &s;trained beyond their manife&s;t de&s;ign, in &s;upport of doctrines they are not intend|ed to teach or explain. Our Lord does not here &s;ay, the heart is made good by the influence of go&s;pel truth upon the mind, neither does he &s;ay the contrary, but only &s;ays the go&s;pel prevails to make the life truly good only in tho&s;e who&s;e hearts are good. From hence you argue that the heart is made good without any influence of the word of God.&mdash;Doctor, by taking the &s;ame liberty in wandering from the de&s;ign of the parable that you do, I can prove that the hearts of good men are <HI>naturally</HI> good, and rea&s;on full as well as you do; thus, the Lord &s;ays nothing about making the heart good, but rather intimates that when the &s;ower &s;ows his &s;eed he finds &s;ome pieces of ground, &s;ome hearts, already good; and we know &s;ome parts of literal ground are naturally good. If you don't like my rea&s;oning and inference, you ought to di&s;like your own, for it is le&s;s plau&s;ible than mine. Doctor, if you would know how the hearts of men are made good and hone&s;t, you mu&s;t look for an account of it in tho&s;e texts that &s;peak of this, not in tho&s;e that &s;ay nothing about it.</P>
<P>Another text I oppo&s;ed to this doctrine of yours, you thus in|troduce and remark upon.
<Q>His &s;econd evidence he introduces thus, Je&s;us &s;ays to the <HI>unconverted</HI> Jews, if ye continue in my word&mdash;ye &s;hall <HI>know</HI> the truth, And <HI>the truth</HI> &s;hall make you

free.</Q>
(John 8.31, 32.)
<Q>N. B. Mr. H. &s;ays the&s;e Jews were <HI>unconverted</HI>: but let us hear the text; Then Je&s;us &s;aid to tho&s;e Jews which <HI>believed on him,</HI> If ye continue in my word, &amp;c.</Q>
(p. 126) This is all you &s;ay in the text of your di&s;cour&s;e</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, Doctor, after you had wrote this, you reflected that it is mo&s;t evident, <HI>from the context,</HI> that the&s;e Jews were <HI>really unconverted,</HI> and unregenerate too; that their faith was far from being &s;aving, was nothing more than a momentary, light per&s;ua|&s;ion that Je&s;us was their expected Me&s;&s;iah; which they were in|duced to admit from an imagination that he was come to enrich them with worldly good things, and which they laid down again upon the &s;pot, as &s;oon as they perceived that he was like to di&s;|appoint the&s;e carnal hopes; and &s;o, that I was right in calling them <HI>unconverted.</HI> Doctor, you know very well that <HI>&s;uch</HI> was their faith, and <HI>&s;uch</HI> their character; I pre&s;ume you do. You perceiv'd that what you &s;aid, carried an intimation that you tho't the&s;e Jews were true believers, and that this would not be &s;atis|fying: and therefore you added in a note,
<Q>Whether the&s;e Jews were <HI>really</HI> converts or not, <HI>I will not determine.</HI></Q>
You can't but know that the context clearly determines they <HI>were not.</HI> You dare not &s;ay <HI>they were,</HI> in the face of &s;uch deci&s;ive evidence; and you would not &s;ay they <HI>were not,</HI> becau&s;e if you admitted this, you could not avoid the evidence the text gives in that your notions concerning regeneration, are fal&s;e. So you gave much &s;uch a prudent an&s;wer as the parents of the blind man gave,&mdash; 'Who hath opened his eyes, <HI>we know not.</HI>'&mdash;You think to get rid of this trouble&s;ome text, by &s;aying (and this is all you further &s;ay)
<Q>However, this is certain, that Chri&s;t &s;peaks to them <HI>as be|lievers on him</HI>: and therefore the&s;e words are nothing to Mr. H's purpo&s;e.</Q>
In this, Doctor, you implicitly acknowlege that if he had &s;poken to them <HI>as unconverted,</HI> they would have been much to my purpo&s;e. Well, but he did &s;peak to them as uncon|verted, and under the pre&s;ent dominion of vicious lu&s;ts, and points out to them the way and means by which they might be delivered from them, be regenerated.</P>
<P N="15">XV. Doctor, you tell us you
<Q>maintain the nece&s;&s;ity of a con&s;tant, diligent, careful attendance on all the means of <HI>know|lege or</HI> of grace which God has appointed; and that the neglect of them is a grievous &s;in, highly provoking to God, <HI>hazardous</HI> to the &s;oul&mdash;and therefore pre&s;s people to the diligent u&s;e of them,</Q>
p. 129. I don't blame you for this.&mdash;I pre&s;ume you call them 'means of <HI>knowlege or</HI> of grace' <HI>upon de&s;ign.</HI> For, upon your principles, they are not means of <HI>grace,</HI> if by grace is meant any
<PB N="52" REF="012066_0027_0F89939D7627F3E0">
more than <HI>knowlege</HI>: and when knowlege is gained by the u&s;e of the&s;e means even the mo&s;t that can be gained by the unregenerate, this is <HI>no means</HI> of <HI>further grace,</HI> and can have no po&s;&s;ible influ|ence, as a means or in&s;trument, in renewing and morally chang|ing the heart; but it nece&s;&s;arily acts as a <HI>means</HI> of <HI>increa&s;ing</HI> the <HI>enmity</HI> of the heart again&s;t God, and making it more like a devil. You, and all in your &s;cheme, had better drop the word <HI>grace,</HI> and only call them means of increa&s;ing &s;uch knowlege as is a means of increa&s;ing enmity, and making men wor&s;e. You tell us you 'hold that the motives,' (i. e. by which God in the go&s;pel urges and draws men to be reconciled to him)
<Q>are made <HI>effectual</HI> by a <HI>preceeding phy&s;ical</HI> energy, new creating the heart or re|newing the will in <HI>order</HI> that the motives may have a <HI>proper in|fluence,</HI></Q>
p. 113 Before this imagined phy&s;ical change, in which knowlege or faith has no place as an in&s;trument or means, you &s;ay,
<Q>The clearer the light &s;hines, the more &s;en&s;ibly will the un|renewed &s;inner's enmity exert it&s;elf</Q>
p. 124. I told you in the dialogue that if this is the ca&s;e, 'tis to no purpo&s;e to addre&s;s men in the apo&s;tle's words, <HI>We be&s;eech you to be reconciled to God; for,</HI> &amp;c. i. e. with a view to per&s;uade them to be reconciled. In your an&s;wer you implicitly allow the con&s;equence to be ju&s;t, and &s;ay, the go&s;pel may an&s;wer that dreadful purpo&s;e ment&iuml;oned in I&s;aiah, <HI>Hear ye indeed but under&s;tand not, &s;ee ye indeed, but perceive not.</HI> p. 125. i. e in plain language, it is adapted to make &s;uch creatures as unrenewed men are, more wicked and mi&s;erable, but not to make them better. Accordingly you reject, with &s;corn, the tho't of a man's being at all prepared or predi&s;po&s;ed to receive the kingdom of God, or to become a new creature, till the mo|ment in which he is made &s;o, by <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> power, by any influ|ence of the go&s;pel &amp; Spirit of Chri&s;t upon him; but, on the contrary, teach that under the highe&s;t illuminations and influences of com|mon grace he remains wholly indi&s;po&s;ed to it, and is more at enmity to it than he was in his uninlightened &s;tate, p. 114. Do you think, Doctor, Elias was &s;ent to prepare the way of the Lord, and make the people ready to receive him, by blowing up their enmity into a flame? Agreeably to your own doctrine you re|pre&s;ent the mo&s;t enlightened and earne&s;t &s;eekers of God's &s;pecial grace, under the highe&s;t influences of common grace, as '<HI>devout phari&s;ees</HI>;' and intimate that a Mary Magdalen, with all her de|vils in her, or publicans and harlots in the mid&s;t of their wick|edne&s;s, are as near to the kingdom of God, or as well di&s;po&s;ed to receive the renewing influence of the Spirit as the&s;e. See your 130th page. The phari&s;ees, Doctor, were di&s;tingui&s;hed from
<PB N="53" REF="012066_0027_0F89939D7627F3E0">
harlots, and common, open, ignorant &s;inners in the&s;e things, (1) They had more knowlege. (2) Greater enmity to God and his truth. (3) They were more devout in outward &s;hew, and were more hypocritical. And your awakened, inlightened, earne&s;t, reforming &s;eekers of God's mercy and grace, are, according to your doctrines and notion of them, like the phari&s;ees in the&s;e re|&s;pects for which rea&s;on. I pre&s;ume, you, after Sandeman, give them the re&s;pectful &amp; encouraging title of <HI>devout phari&s;ees.</HI> If this is their true character, you ought to place them in the rear, behind har|lots, and open &s;inners, who don't trouble them&s;elves about reli|gion, for they are really wor&s;e men, as the old phari&s;ees were, (and &s;o your doctrine &s;ays) and to tell them plainly, as our Lord does their predece&s;&s;ors, that publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of God before them, becau&s;e they are more ea&s;ily bro't to repen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ance. And when by your teachings and their diligent, earne&s;t endeavors in the u&s;e of means, in compliance with your exhortations, you have compleatly formed them <HI>devout phari&s;ees,</HI> you &s;hould &s;ay to them.
<Q>Ye &s;erpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye e&s;cape the damnation of hell?</Q>
Can you bear the application of your own doctrines?</P>
<P>You &s;ay, Doctor, 'tis hazardous for men to neglect the means of grace. 'Tis indeed &s;o: but according to your doctrine, 'tis in one view more hazardous to u&s;e than to neglect them. Your doctrines defeat your exhortations, and render them vain and ab|&s;urd. If the people under&s;tood them clearly, and believed them fully, they would &s;oon be reduced to abhor the offerings of the Lord, and take up the re&s;olution of the Jewi&s;h de&s;peradoes, <HI>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we die.</HI></P>
<P>You tell us, Doctor, that you 'pre&s;s people to u&s;e the means of grace &mdash;becau&s;e this is the way in which God is p&s;ea&s;ed to work, and out of which there is no rea&s;on to expect he ever will work this ble&s;&s;ed change,' <HI>regeneration.</HI> This is the way: but if your doctrines were true, it could not be &s;o. Have you &s;o corrupted in your&s;elf the right &s;en&s;e of God as to imagine that he puts men upon a cour&s;e of means and endeavors, which can have no better effect than to make them <HI>devout phari&s;ees,</HI> and render them <HI>two fold more the children of hell</HI> than they were before, as an ordinarily nece&s;&s;ary preliminary to his regenerating them? Do you think the beauty and moral excellency of God's character &s;hines gloriou&s;ly in &s;uch a method of procedure? I pre&s;ume you and others have been lead to talk in &s;uch an unworthy manner of the way of God with men, as con&s;equentially imputes folly and moral ab&s;urdity to him, without reflecting &s;eriou&s;ly on the ten|dency

of your doctrines. I hope you will now reflect, and lay your hand on your mouth.</P>
<P>I only add, that if you write again, I hope you will write with fairne&s;s, equity and honor. If in the &s;ame &s;pirit as before, you may an&s;wer your&s;elf; for you will be wholly unworthy the notice of any one el&s;e.&mdash;As I have pointed out to you &s;ome of your great offences again&s;t your brother, I pre&s;ume you are con|vinced of them: and I now expect you will publicly retract the many fal&s;e and injurious things you have te&s;tified again&s;t me, be|fore the churches and world.

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>DOCTOR, one thing which merits notice I have re&s;erved for this place. You mention this text as favoring your doctrine, and &s;eem to triumph in it, as all in your &s;cheme do, viz <HI>The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooli&s;hne&s;s to him; neither can he know them, becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned. But he that is &s;piritual judgeth all things,</HI> 1 Cor 11.14, 15. On this you &s;ay,
<Q>By <HI>natural man</HI> is evidently meant the unregenerate man. Now it is here affirm|ed of this natural man, that he <HI>di&s;cerneth</HI> not the things of the Spirit of God.</Q>
(No, Doctor, the apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>receiveth</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In your quotation of the text you al&s;o threw out the apo&s;tle's word, <HI>receiveth,</HI> and took in the word <HI>di&s;cerneth,</HI> which &s;ounds more favorably for you. I hope, Doctor, you did it in adver|tantly.</NOTE>)
<Q>Whatever knowlege he may have, he <HI>di&s;cerns</HI> nothing of the <HI>&s;piritual glory</HI> and <HI>beauty</HI> of divine objects, i. e. he has <HI>no ta&s;te for moral excellency.</HI> And the rea&s;on is given, viz. They are fooli&s;hne&s;s to him, i. e. in his view of them: and if &s;o, they mu&s;t be <HI>abhorred</HI>; for what appears <HI>fooli&s;h</HI>&mdash; mu&s;t be hateful, in <HI>this view of it.</HI> Here then is a full proof that the natural man &s;ees no beauty in, but really loaths the things of God, and therefore has no ta&s;te for moral excellency. q. e. p.</Q>
(p. 88.) q. e. p. which was to be proved. Doctor, you have proved no|thing but that you don't under&s;tand the text at all. I ob&s;erve two or three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. The apo&s;tle &s;ays the natural man <HI>receiveth not,</HI> and <HI>cannot know</HI> the things of the Spirit of God. You allow he may know them, but &s;ay he can't di&s;cern their &s;piritual glory and beauty; i. e. has no ta&s;te for moral excellency. Your propo&s;ition is not the &s;ame in &s;en&s;e with the apo&s;tle's, but a very different one. Yours may be fal&s;e, and yet his be true.</P>
<P N="2">2. By the <HI>things of the Spirit</HI> the apo&s;tle means tho&s;e things which belong to the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> as its <HI>peculiars.</HI> You extend the &s;en&s;e &s;o as to comprehend all things of a moral nature; and &s;o infer that
<PB N="56" REF="012066_0029_0F89939EF652F798">
natural men have no ta&s;te for moral excellency. But you put much more into your premi&s;es than the apo&s;tle will &s;upport you in. The&s;e are moral rules of God's moral government, viz. <HI>Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf,</HI> and <HI>do to him what&s;oever,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>With what mea&s;ure you meet it &s;hall be mea&s;ured to you again.</HI> Do you think this text warrants you in &s;aying, No unregenerate man can di&s;cern or ta&s;te any moral fitne&s;s, beauty, or excellency in the&s;e moral rules? If you do, you are &s;unk below the &s;tandard of common &s;en&s;e: if you do not, you mu&s;t &s;ee your demon&s;tration fails, and &s;o your q. e. p. remains yet to be proved: it will be your wi&s;dom never to attempt it again.</P>
<P N="3">3. In endeavoring to prove that natural men have no ta&s;te for moral beauty and excellence, you have proved the contrary. You &s;ay,
<Q>What appears <HI>foolli&s;h, mu&s;t</HI> be <HI>hateful</HI> to the <HI>natural man,</HI> in this view of it.</Q>
Why &s;o, Doctor? You mu&s;t an&s;wer, be|cau&s;e moral fooli&s;hne&s;s is, in its own nature, hateful and con|temptible, as moral wi&s;dom is of an amiable nature. Very true: and &s;o men have a natural &s;en&s;e or ta&s;te for moral worth or ex|cellency. If they &s;aw the object in a true light they would love it: all that is wanting, according to this po&s;ition of yours, is only to give the mind a ju&s;t view of the object. This proves too much. A &s;inful man may po&s;&s;ibly &s;ee a particular di&s;pen&s;ation of divine government to be <HI>wi&s;e,</HI> and yet hate and oppo&s;e it, from intere&s;ted views, or thro' partial regard to his lu&s;ts, which inter|fere with it.</P>
<P>If we would gain a right under&s;tanding of this text, we &s;hould carefully examine what the apo&s;tle here means, (1) by <HI>the things of the Spirit.</HI> (2) What by <HI>receiving</HI> and <HI>knowing</HI> them. (3) What by their being <HI>&s;piritually di&s;cerned.</HI> (4) What by the <HI>na|tural man.</HI> When we have got all his ideas right in re&s;pect to the&s;e particulars, we &s;hall &s;ee how, and whence it is that the natural man receiveth not, &amp;c. I pre&s;ume when you wrote your comment, you had none of them right. If we enquire wi&s;ely concerning the&s;e things, I pre&s;ume we &s;hall &s;ee clearly, (1) That by <HI>the things of the Spirit of God,</HI> the apo&s;tle intends the doctrines concerning Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the grace of God towards man by him, and the &s;alvation of tho&s;e that believe, thro the merit of his cro&s;s: which doctrine concerning the cro&s;s, he &s;ays, is a <HI>&s;tumbling block to the</HI> (unbelieving) <HI>Jews, and fooli&s;hne&s;s to the</HI> (infidel) <HI>Gentiles,</HI> tho' it is &s;een to be the <HI>wi&s;dom and power of God,</HI> by tho&s;e that <HI>believe,</HI> and avails to their <HI>&s;alvation.</HI> (See 1 Cor. 1.23, 24.) He &s;tiles the&s;e things, <HI>The things that are freely given to us of God,</HI> context, ver. 12 He el&s;ewhere calls the&s;e <HI>&s;piritual things.</HI> And the rea&s;on
<PB N="57" REF="012066_0029_0F89939EF652F798">
of his calling them &s;o, and, <HI>The things of the Spirit of God,</HI> is that this Spirit is the revealer and teacher of them, and a witne&s;s from God, and for Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to the truth of them; without which &s;upernatural teaching and witne&s;s, men could not have conceived any idea of the&s;e things, and have known them to be true and from God.
<Q>As it is written, Eye hath not &s;een, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man the things God hath prepared for them that love him.</Q>
(i. e. any idea or knowlege of them, till God revealed them)
<Q>But God hath revealed them unto us <HI>by his Spirit.</HI>&mdash;Now we have received&mdash;the Spirit that is of God, that we might <HI>know</HI> the things that are freely given to us of God,</Q>
cont. ver. 9, 10, 12. See and compare the texts referred to below.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John 16.13&mdash;15. Rev. 2.7. Rom. 15.27. 1 Cor. 9.11.&mdash;12.1.&mdash;14.37. Col. 1.9.&mdash;Spiritual under&s;tanding, i. e. a true under&s;tanding of tho&s;e things which are freely given to us of God, and revealed by his Spirit, and now written in his word.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. By <HI>knowing</HI> and <HI>receiving</HI> the&s;e things of the Spirit of God the apo&s;tle intends, knowing them to be true &amp; divine, knowing them to be from God and worthy of him, a divine method of &s;aving &s;in|ners, full of wi&s;dom and grace; and receiving them <HI>as &s;uch in faith,</HI> and thereupon embracing the chri&s;tian religion. To receive the&s;e things is the &s;ame in &s;ub&s;tance as to receive Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and become di&s;ciples to him. Ob&s;erve the following texts, John 8.19. ch. 14. 7, 9, 10, 11. ch. 15.15, 21. ch. 17.7, 8, 25. Col. 1.25&mdash;27. 1 Joh. 4.16. Joh 7.17. ch. 8.32. Mat. 10.14, 41. Joh. 3.11. ch. 5.43. ch. 14.17. Acts 22.18. 1 Joh. 5.9. Joh. 1.11, 12. Acts 2.41. ch. 11.1. Col. 2.6. 1 The&s;. 2.13.</P>
<P N="3">3. The&s;e &s;piritual things are <HI>&s;piritually di&s;cerned.</HI> By di&s;cerning them the apo&s;tle means, &s;o examining them as to di&s;cern them to be true and divine, from God, and worthy of him, &s;o as to &s;ettle down in the belief of them. The Greek word <HI>anakrino</HI> &s;ignifies to examine and &s;earch out a thing, in order to know what it re|ally is, and to judge. The apo&s;tle u&s;eth the word, 1 Cor. 4.4. where it is rendered <HI>judgeth,</HI> (as it is cont. ver. 15) <HI>I know nothing by my&s;elf,</HI> (i. e. whereby I am &s;elf-condemned) <HI>but he that judgeth me</HI> (i. e. examineth and di&s;cerneth what I really am, and judgeth me according to the truth of my character) <HI>is the Lord.</HI> So the word <HI>di&s;cern</HI> is frequently u&s;ed by our tran&s;lators, as in Gen. 27.23. <HI>He di&s;cerned him not.</HI> I&s;aac, tho' he examined Jacob, yet did not di&s;tingui&s;h him, but judged him to be E&s;au. So in this text, to di&s;cern the things of the Spirit of God, is by examining to
<PB N="58" REF="012066_0030_0F89939FB6766200">
di&s;cern them to be of God, true, divine and excellent, to di&s;tin|gui&s;h them with judgment from the things of men, their cunning|ly devi&s;ed fables.&mdash;Now the apo&s;tle &s;ays they are <HI>&s;piritually di&s;|cerned,</HI> i. e. thus di&s;cerned and di&s;tingui&s;hed only by the light, teaching, and te&s;timony of the Spirit of God. This is evidently his meaning; and this is mo&s;t true. For the&s;e &s;upernatural doc|trines concerning our &s;alvation by the cro&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, owe their very exi&s;tence, <HI>as truths,</HI> to the &s;overeign good plea&s;ure of God's will; which could never be known to be &s;uch as it is, but by his free revelation of it to men. This revelation he has made by his Spirit; and by his Spirit they are atte&s;ted as truths of God: and men di&s;cern them to be &s;uch, only in his light, through his teaching, and by admitting his te&s;timony to their truth, as good and &s;ufficient evidence. On this te&s;timony go&s;pel faith is founded. <HI>It is the Spirit that beareth witne&s;s&mdash;If we receive the witne&s;s of men, the witne&s;s of God is greater&mdash;He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witne&s;s in him&s;elf&mdash;He that believeth not God, hath made him a liar, becau&s;e he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son,</HI> 1 John 5.6, 9, 10.&mdash;Examine and compare the following texts, in which the &s;ame Greek word is u&s;ed which is here ren|dered <HI>di&s;cerned,</HI> viz. Luke 23.14. Acts 4.9. ch. 17.11. 1 Cor. 10.25, 27. ch 14.24. Acts 25.26. <HI>anakri&s;is,</HI> examination 1 Cor. 9.3. Acts 12.19. Acts 28.18.</P>
<P>Let us next examine what the apo&s;tle here means by the <HI>natu|ral man.</HI> The Greek word here rendered <HI>natural,</HI> is <HI>p&s;uchikos,</HI> which is derived from <HI>p&s;uke,</HI> which &s;ignifies the &s;oul natural to man as a living man: &s;o the apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>Adam was made a living &s;oul. P&s;ukeen Zo&s;an.</HI></P>
<P>Leigh. in his <HI>Critica Saena,</HI> thus renders the word,

In the margin he quotes Beza thus,
<Q><HI>p&s;uchikos anthropos,</HI> i e. homo non alta quam naturali animi luce preditus. A man that hath only <HI>na|tural</HI> abilities and perfections.</Q>
The apo&s;tle &s;peake of a <HI>natural</HI> body and a <HI>&s;piritual</HI> body, and oppo&s;es them to each other, ju&s;t as be here does the natural and &s;piritual man.
<Q>It is &s;own <HI>&s;oma p&s;uchikon,</HI> a <HI>natural</HI> body, it is rai&s;ed a &s;piritual body,</Q>
1 Cor. 15.44. i. e The body is &s;own in the ground &s;uch as we recei|ved it by natural generation, without any &s;upernatural improve|ment or change, but it is rai&s;ed a &s;piritual body, gloriou&s;ly chan|ged by the &s;upernatural operation of the Spirit of God. So he &s;ays, the fir&s;t man was made a living &s;oul. When God breathed into him the breath of life, and endowed him with a living &s;oul, furni&s;hed with its proper, natural faculties, capacities and pa&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="59" REF="012066_0030_0F89939FB6766200">
he was hereby con&s;tituted a compleat man. The work of crea|ting man thus fini&s;hed, God <HI>immediately</HI> communicated his Spirit to him, and thereby breathed into his new form'd &s;oul the breath of a &s;piritual life, &s;uperadded to the natural; or in other words, by his &s;upernatural illumination and influence, communicated the true knowlege of God, and awakened the new-c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eated &s;oul <HI>in|&s;tantly</HI> into filial and holy di&s;po&s;itions and exerci&s;es towards his maker and father. Thus he was formed a <HI>&s;piritual</HI> man &mdash; But in the hour of temptation he rebelled again&s;t the light, and grieved the Spirit, and he for&s;ook his defiled habitation; and &s;o he became a mere <HI>natural man,</HI> dead to the &s;piritual life, not hav|ing the Spirit. This he &s;hewed &s;ufficiently by his fooli&s;hly en|deavoring to hide him&s;elf among the trees from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, when he perceived him approaching.&mdash;This forfeited and lo&s;t gift of the Spirit, was re&s;tored, and could be re&s;tored, only on the foot of a new di&s;pen&s;ation of &s;overeign grace, freely given thro' a re&s;pect to the &s;acrifice and mediation of the Son of God, the de&s;tin'd Redeemer. This grace was now revealed to Adam, and given on this new foundation, to teach him this &s;u|pernatural doctrine, and revive &s;piritual life in him, thro' faith of this new and &s;urprizing di&s;covery; and doubtle&s;s was thankfully received, and wro't in our fir&s;t parents immediate repentance, while they &s;tood before their <HI>judge</HI> and <HI>&s;aviour</HI> And thus they once more became &s;piritual per&s;ons, having received the Spirit of God, as given from the Father, by the Redeemer.&mdash;This re&s;to|red gift could not con&s;i&s;tently be conveyed to Adam's children, together with tho&s;e natural gifts which con&s;titute them men, in the channel of natural generation; or, in other words, could not be connected with the gift of a living &s;oul to his po&s;terity: For he is not the covenant head, from whom this &s;upernatural gift of grace flows, but received it him&s;elf from Chri&s;t as <HI>his</HI> covenant head, as all his children mu&s;t, if they ever partake of it.&mdash; Therefore the apo&s;tle, con&s;idering Adam, now fallen, in relation to his &s;eed, repre&s;ents him only as a <HI>natural man,</HI> de&s;titute of the Spirit: for he can now convey no more to his natural &s;eed, but the gifts which belong to human nature as &s;uch, by which they are formed natural men. <HI>The fir&s;t man Adam was made a living &s;oul: the la&s;t Adam was made a quickning &s;pirit</HI>&mdash;Made &s;o to his &s;eed, by the con&s;titution of the new covenant. He quickens both &s;oul and body; but fir&s;t the &s;oul, by giving his Spirit; by receiv|ing and obeying of which, they are rendered &s;piritual men; are &s;piritual &s;o far as they receive, believe and walk in his light, and no farther.&mdash;The&s;e ob&s;ervations will lead us to a clear under|&s;tanding
<PB N="60" REF="012066_0031_0F8993A074461098">
of many other texts, particularly that John 3.3, 5, 6, and that we are examining.&mdash;By the <HI>&s;piritual man,</HI> the apo&s;tle here intends &s;uch as have received the Spirit of God, given by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as a teacher; have received his revelation of the things of Chri&s;t, and believed them on the credit of his witne&s;s, and &s;o &s;et to their &s;eal that God is true in what he has &s;poken and te&s;tified concerning his Son by his Spirit. He &s;ays, <HI>God hath revealed them to us by his Spirit</HI>&mdash;and <HI>We have received the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God</HI>&mdash;and &s;o <HI>We have the mind of Chri&s;t</HI>&mdash;and <HI>he that is &s;piritual judgeth all things.</HI> i e. &s;o far as he has received the light which the Spirit gives, examining, he di&s;cerns and clearly di&s;tin|gui&s;hes the truth and wi&s;dom of God from the fables and folly of men: As our Lord &s;ays, <HI>My &s;heep hear my voice and follow me: but a &s;tranger will they not follow, but will flee from him; for they know not the voice of &s;trangers.</HI></P>
<P>I think we can't now be in doubt what the apo&s;tle means by the <HI>natural man</HI>&mdash;He evidently intends &s;uch as have not received the Spirit of God, as their teacher, in his revelation of the hidden things of God to men, and do not give credit to his &s;upernatural witne&s;s to their truth; but are led and influenced in their judg|ment concerning the&s;e things, <HI>by the &s;pirit that is of the world,</HI> i e. act under the bla&s;ing and blinding influence of the &s;pirit of error and worldly lu&s;ts. Such do not receive the&s;e things as true and divine, neither can they know them to be &s;o, &s;o long as they re|fu&s;e the light and witne&s;s of the Spirit of God; for they are <HI>&s;pi|ritually di&s;cerned,</HI> are di&s;tingui&s;hed from fal&s;e and fooli&s;h things, and perceived to be from God, only by that &s;upernatural light which is communicated by the Spirit&mdash;Therefore it is &s;aid, <HI>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit &s;aith to the churches.</HI></P>
<P>When Je&s;us Chri&s;t came to the Jewi&s;h people, as a teacher &s;ent from God to reveal the my&s;teries of his will, the Spirit of God &s;pake to the people by him, and witne&s;&s;ed to the truth of his mi&s;&s;i|on and doctrine: but many received him not, but di&s;believed and rejected the witne&s;s of the Spirit. The&s;e were natural men, who were led by the &s;pirit of this world, and in&s;tead of receiving the Spirit of God, offering him&s;elf as their guide and teacher, they perver&s;ely re&s;i&s;ted him, as being &s;tiffnecked and uncircumci&s;ed in heart and ears. So the Spirit departed from them, and God gave them over to blindne&s;s of mind, and hardne&s;s of heart. But &s;ome that heard did believe, and received Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and in re|ceiving him received his Spirit, and &s;o became &s;piritual men. Such as were too &s;trongly attached to their lu&s;ts to be per&s;uaded
<PB N="61" REF="012066_0031_0F8993A074461098">
to renounce them by the light and teaching of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the given drawing influence and witne&s;s of his Spirit, and to come out of the world, after Chri&s;t, were, after proper trials to gain them, abandoned, and confirmed as children of this world. And &s;o it mu&s;t be; for &s;uch cannot receive the Spirit of God&mdash; And to what purpo&s;e is it for the Lord to &s;tand always knocking at their door, when they will not know his voice and open the door unto him? Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;ays, <HI>The world cannot receive the Spirit of Truth, becau&s;e it &s;eeth him not, neither knoweth him,</HI> John 14.17. They may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;ee what his doctrine is, and &s;ee his works and witne&s;s by the go&s;pel revelation; but they don't &s;ee the Spirit of God in them, don't know that 'tis he that &s;peaks to them by the go&s;pel revelation, and bears witne&s;s to its truths, by the&s;e works; but fatally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in taking him for a fal&s;e and deceiving &s;pirit. Thus the perver&s;e Jews, who were wholly of this world, covetous, ambitious and &s;en&s;ual, &s;aw the doctrine of Chri&s;t, and to what it tended, viz. to confound the lu&s;ts of this world, and de&s;troy the works of the devil; and they &s;aw the &s;upernatural works by which the Spirit of God witne&s;&s;ed to their truth, as from God; but they did not <HI>&s;ee him</HI> in all this. They plainly &s;aw and acknowleged that a &s;upernatural &s;pirit attended upon Je&s;us Chri&s;t, mini&s;tring to him, and witne&s;&s;ing to what he &s;aid: but they did not know that this was the Spirit of God, but imagined he was a deceiving &s;pirit, and &s;aid, 'He ca&s;teth out devils by Beelzebub the prince of devils.' Thus they evaded the evidence, and could not receive the light and te&s;timony of the Spirit of God witne&s;&s;ing to his Son Je&s;us.&mdash;But why could they not &s;ee and know this Spirit, in di&s;tinction from that of the devil? They &s;aw the doctrine he witne&s;&s;ed to, militated again&s;t their lu&s;ts, and condemned their indulgence of them, and mena|ced them with de&s;truction, unle&s;s they gave them up: this they were ob&s;tinately determined not to do: they therefore &s;hut their eyes again&s;t the light, and wilfully &s;et them&s;elves to oppo&s;e it; and becau&s;e they could evade the witne&s;s of the Spirit to its truth no other way, they &s;aid, 'It is not the Spirit of God that bears witne&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> but the &s;pirit of devils." All ob&s;tinately wicked men, who &s;in on perver&s;ely again&s;t the light and te&s;timony of the Spirit of Je&s;us Chri&s;t are in the &s;ame &s;pirit of this world: all the dif|ference it in the degree of its &s;trength and malignity&mdash;This, Doctor, and not want of natural capacity to &s;ee moral excellence, and a natural, inwro't, incurable hatred to it, is the true cau&s;e why &s;uch men receive not the things of the Spirit of God, and cannot know and approve them as of God, but e&s;teem them as fooli&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="012066_0032_0F8993A13397FA30">The conclu&s;ion of the whole matter is this; Paul &s;ays to this purpo&s;e, Men can't know the go&s;pel or doctrine concerning Je&s;us Chri&s;t to be of God and worthy of God, unle&s;s they receive the Spirit of God as the revealer of the&s;e things, and admit his witne&s;s to them as being of God, not of men, as a true and divine te&s;ti|mony; that if they, as bia&s;&s;ed by la&s;ts, refu&s;e and reject him, there is no other way of di&s;cerning them to be of God; but they, as led by the &s;pirit of the world, will account them fabulous and fooli&s;h: (This has been verified throughout the whole world, from that day to this) He &s;ays, on the other hand, That if men receive the Spirit, by which God revealed the&s;e things to men, as of God, and credit his te&s;timony, they may, by his teach|ing, know them to be of God, and, in his light, di&s;tingui&s;h them from the things of men, and di&s;cern their divine excellence and glory.&mdash;You, on the contrary, &s;ay to this purpo&s;e, That no ilumination, teaching and te&s;timony of the Spirit which he can give to men, can enable them to di&s;cern any moral or &s;piritual excellency and glory in the&s;e things, and at all di&s;po&s;e them to receive the truth in faith and love, unle&s;s the Spirit fir&s;t creates a new gu&s;t or faculty of ta&s;te in them, by a phy&s;ical operation with|out light.&mdash;Doctor you are very unlucky in the choice of this text: it clearly condemns your doctrine.
<Q>Which ought to have mo&s;t weight</Q>
your opinion, or the apo&s;tle's doctrine?</P>
