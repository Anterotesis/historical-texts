<P>IN the preceding Chapter the Apo&s;tle endeavours by various Arguments, to Confirm the Ephe&s;ians in the Belief of this great Truth, That Divine Grace alone Challenges the
<PB N="2" REF="003123_0004_0FF0029DF16E8E68">
Glory of the Salvation of Sinners. In this, he Amplifies the Riches of it, from the Con&s;ideration of the &s;tate &s;uch are in, before they are Quickned with Chri&s;t: And this he tells them in the fir&s;t Ver&s;e, <HI>is a &s;tate of Death; Ye were dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins</HI>: Not only Judicially dead, becau&s;e obnoxious to Death, but really Spiritually dead, alie|nated in their Hearts from GOD; which is properly Spiritual Death. This their Spi|ritual Death, he proves from the Effects or Fruits of it; when he tells them their Life had been in Sin, a Walk, or Cour&s;e in Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, reli&s;hing only what was Car|nal, under the Influence and Dominion of Satan; who before their Conver&s;ion had ruled in them, as he always does in the Children of Di&s;obedience, in the &s;econd Ver&s;e. And to &s;hew them that Divine Grace was as Con&s;picuous in the Salvation of others, as of them, he ob&s;erves that &s;uch a condition as he had been de&s;cribing, was not peculiar to the Ephe&s;ians, but common to all, till Renewed by the Spirit of CHRIST even including him&s;elf, (who el&s;ewhere &s;peaks of him&s;elf as being Blamele&s;s, as to the External Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Law) in the third Ver&s;e; Among which <HI>Sons of Di&s;|obedience,</HI> &s;aith he, in whom Sin Reigns and over whom Satan Lords it, <HI>we all had in Time

pa&s;t, our Conver&s;ation al&s;o, in the Lu&s;ts of our Fle&s;h, fulfilling the de&s;ires of the Fle&s;h and of the Mind; and more by Nature the Children of Wrath, even as others.</HI> No one by Nature, having in this re&s;pect any Excellency above another. To be delivered from &s;uch a Mi&s;erable State as this, To have a Spiritu|al Life Communicated from CHRIST, and made to grow up in Him to the fulne&s;s of the Stature of a Perfect man, &amp; to be rai&s;ed up together and made to &s;it together in Heavenly Places in CHRIST JESUS; which tho' not &s;een with our eyes, but is hid in the Chri&s;tian's Hope, and of which he may be &s;aid to have already Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion <HI>in CHRIST.</HI> This as is ob&s;erved in the Context mu&s;t needs carry their thoughts, to a Mercy In|finite in its Riches, and to an Infinite A|&s;toni&s;hingly free Love as the &s;pring of it; and to make the Conclu&s;ion with the A|po&s;tle in the Text, That Grace alone may Glory in their Salvation. <HI>For by Grace are ye Saved,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>WHERE may be ob&s;erved;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE true Cau&s;e of our Salvation a&s;&s;erted; By Grace are ye Saved. Grace</HI> is &s;ometimes u&s;ed for the <HI>Free Favour of GOD</HI>; and &s;ome|times for the <HI>Effects of that Favour</HI> in us
<PB N="4" REF="003123_0005_0FF002972F315C20">
But it is <HI>here u&s;ed</HI> in its Primary acceptati|on, for the <HI>Free Favour,</HI> Love, or Good will <HI>of GOD,</HI> as the Fountain whence all Gifts flow to us.</P>
<P><HI>SALVATION,</HI> may be Con&s;idered either as <HI>Begun,</HI> or <HI>Compleat</HI>; both which are Included in his a&s;&s;ertion, as the Context abundantly proves. <HI>From Grace it is begun</HI> and <HI>compleated.</HI></P>
<P>And Secondly,</P>
<P N="2">2. A fal&s;ely &s;uppo&s;ed cau&s;e of our Salva|tion <HI>Rejected. Our &s;elves.</HI> A Di&s;po&s;ition to advance Self in oppo&s;ition to Grace, in its method of &s;aving Sinners, is deeply rooted in us; every one naturally &s;ets up a Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of his own, &s;omething he imagines he finds in him&s;elf, or &s;omething he has done as a ground of his acceptance, or at lea&s;t as what moves the exerci&s;e of Divine Compa&s;&s;ion towards him, This the Apo&s;tle entirely Rejects, <HI>Not of your &s;elves.</HI> It is not for any thing in us that Salvation is be&s;tow|ed, or for <HI>any works</HI> we do, which he adds to confirm this Truth, and &s;ubjoins the rea|&s;on, becau&s;e works as they &s;tand not with Grace, &s;o they are Enemies to the Glory of it, ina&s;much as they &s;et up Glory in our &s;elves, <HI>Le&s;t any man &s;hould Boa&s;t.</HI> So that nothing is to be attributed to Self, as Cau&s;al

of this Salvation; No, for although it be <HI>through Faith,</HI> yet we can't challenge any thing; for Faith Renounces all Works, Wi&s;|dom, &amp; Worthine&s;s of our own, and brings us empty to GOD, receiving CHRIST for Wi&s;dom, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Sanctification, and Redemption. Nor is it from any &s;trength in us by which we do this, but the LORD gives this; and therefore the Apo&s;tle adds, <HI>It is the Gift of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>Whence the DOCTRINE is,</P>
<P>THE Salvation of Sinners, is, in every part of it from the Grace of GOD.</P>
<P>ALL the Good that ever the fallen Crea|ture can have, mu&s;t i&s;&s;ue out of GOD's free Love; which is a motive to it &s;elf for the doing good to the Sinful and Mi&s;erable Creature. GOD is Kind and Merciful to it becau&s;e he will be &s;o. He acts mo&s;t freely herein, and the rea&s;on of it is not to be look|ed for out of Him&s;elf.</P>
<P>IN handling of the Doctrine, I &s;hall en|deavour briefly to Evince the following Propo&s;ition.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>IT is from Grace, That CHRIST was given to be a Saviour.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="6" REF="003123_0006_0FF002ACA2EE46A8">II. <HI>IT is from Grace, That this SAVIOUR is made Known to any.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>IT is from Grace, That any are Effectu|ally prevailed upon to Believe in Him, or to accept of Salvation by Him.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>IT is from Grace, that &s;uch as do Be|lieve in Him, are made to Per&s;evere in Faith &amp; Holine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>THAT their Salvation is Con&s;ummated in GLORY, is al&s;o from Grace.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>IT is from Grace that CHRIST was given to be a Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>MAN was Capacitated and de&s;igned for a glorious Service, the Knowing, Loving and glorifying his MAKER, and by an abundant Goodne&s;s was encouraged thereto; Yet did act &s;o Unworthily towards Him in violating his Laws, di&s;owning his Authority over him and renouncing his Dependence upon Him and Obligations to him, That when it is &s;eriou&s;ly Thought of, we may ju&s;tly be filled with Wonder that Vengeance did not pur|&s;ue him with Everla&s;ting Puni&s;hments. It mu&s;t force a Conviction in us, that he is de&s;titute of a Plea for favour from a Ju&s;tly Incen&s;ed DEITY, and that no Injury is
<PB N="7" REF="003123_0006_0FF002ACA2EE46A8">
done him if he is everla&s;tingly left under His Frowns. Relief can ari&s;e to him from no Spring but the meer Mercy of GOD; From That &amp; no other Fountain, could the amazing Gift of a SAVIOUR flow. Had the good Will, the Grace of GOD &s;u&s;pended its act of giving the SAVIOUR, all Man|kind would have been left in a &s;tate of Sin, and Wrath; and that act might have been &s;u&s;pended, might not have been, if it had &s;eemed good to the Mo&s;t High &s;o to have Determined. If that act could not have been &s;u&s;pended, it was then a matter of Ne|ce&s;&s;ity, what mu&s;t, and could not but have been Antecedent to any act of GOD's Will about it. Which will &s;uppo&s;e, Ab&s;olute Freedom, &s;ubject to Con&s;traint that indeed there is no &s;uch thing in GOD as Ab&s;olute Freedom. And as there was no nece&s;&s;ity from the nature of the thing, &s;o there was no nece&s;&s;ity lying upon GOD with relation to his own Perfections, to give his SON as a SAVIOUR to the World. Not on the ac|count of Glorifying Him&s;elf this way by the di&s;covery of His Mercy. 'Tis certain He always acts for his own Glory, becau&s;e there is none greater than Him&s;elf. But that he &s;hould Glorify Him&s;elf by the di&s;covery of His Mercy, in providing a SAVIOUR for Sinners, He could not be Nece&s;&s;itated to,
<PB N="8" REF="003123_0007_0FF002BC16BA40A8">
&s;ince if he had &s;een fit he might have glori|fied his Ju&s;tice &amp; Power in their De&s;truction. There could be no Nece&s;&s;ity upon GOD in point of Ju&s;tice to do it, for Man by breaking the Law, righteou&s;ly de&s;erved Death. So that Man would have had no In|jury done him by GOD, if that Sentence had been Executed upon him, Nor could there be any Nece&s;&s;ity from the Infinite Mercy &amp; Compa&s;&s;ion of GOD. GOD has; Mercy large enough to Relieve all his Crea|tures that may be in Mi&s;ery, but there is no nece&s;&s;ity in the nature of Infinite Compa&s;&s;i|on to Relieve them: If there were, it mu&s;t extend it &s;elf in a like manner to all in Mi|&s;ery, and &s;o it were Impo&s;&s;ible that any of his Creatures &s;hould render them&s;elves final|ly Mi&s;erable, by any Sin. The Contrary whereof we are a&s;&s;ured. The exerci&s;e of his Mercy is under the Command of his Will, and why it is exerci&s;ed towards one in Mi&s;ery and not towards another, is only becau&s;e it is His Plea&s;ure: So that this Act of giving his Son to be the Saviour of Man|kind, might not have been, if it had &s;eemed good to him not to have done it; and &s;o all Mankind had Eternally and Ju&s;tly Peri&s;hed. From no other Fountain therefore but Sove|reign Grace, does flow this glorious Gift of a Saviour. This Gift was made to a Sinful
<PB N="9" REF="003123_0007_0FF002BC16BA40A8">
World becau&s;e it plea&s;ed GOD &s;o to Ma|nife&s;t his Love 1 Joh. 4 9. <HI>In this was Ma|nife&s;ted the Love of GOD towards us, becau&s;e that GOD &s;ent his only Begotten Son into the World, that we might Live through him.</HI> Joh. 3 16. <HI>GOD &s;o Loved the World, that he gave his only Begotten Son, that who&s;oever Believeth in him, might not Peri&s;h, but have Everla&s;ting Life.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>IT is from Grace, that a SAVIOUR, &amp; a way of Salvation by Him, a made Known to a|ny.</HI></P>
<P>THE Go&s;pel is not a Debt to any Na|tion; for as GOD owes no Mercy to any Sinner, Not the giving of a SAVIOUR, So not the Revealing of Him to any People; All are equally unworthy by Nature of &s;uch a Benefit; being equally Sinners, they are equally Children of Wrath. Not any one more than another de&s;erves it, nor any one at all; therefore that any one has it, is an act of meer Grace. That one Man or one Nation is pa&s;&s;ed by and &s;uffered to dwell in Ignorance, and another enjoys the Go&s;pel-Light, is from the good Plea&s;ure of the Divine Will. Why was it that GOD pa&s;&s;ed by the re&s;t of the Nations of the World, and cho&s;e ISRAEL to be a peculiar People to Him&s;elf? Not becau&s;e they had more to commend them than any other Nation; but
<PB N="10" REF="003123_0008_0FF002B4B6F80968">
becau&s;e it plea&s;ed GOD to &s;eparate them from others; who being equally LORD of all, might &s;ingle out whom He would to be the Subjects of his Favour; might overlook o|thers, and Choo&s;e them: or have pa&s;&s;ed by them, and Selected others. His taking them to be a peculiar Trea&s;ure to him&s;elf above all People, He a&s;&s;erts him&s;elf to be an Act of his Sovereignty, and the Rea&s;on of &s;uch a Di&s;pen&s;ation to be re&s;olved into that; <HI>For all the Earth is mine</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>Exod.</HI> 19.5. <HI>So Deut.</HI> 10.14, 15. <HI>Behold the Heaven and the Heaven of Heavens is the LORD's thy GOD, the Earth al&s;o with all that therein is. Only the LORD had a Delight in thy Fathers, to love them and he cho&s;e their Seed after them, even you above all People, as it is this Day.</HI></P>
<P>AND it is evident there was nothing in them as the Ground of it, from their Fro|ward and Rebellious Carriage under all the Kindne&s;s and Mercy &s;hewed them. This GOD fore&s;aw, and told them before hand, they would be Rebellious from their youth; to prevent their entertaining &s;uch an Ima|gination. I&s;a 48.4 &mdash; 8 <HI>Becau&s;e I knew that thou art Ob&s;tinate, and thy Neck is an Iron Sinew, and thy Brow Bra&s;s' &mdash; I have even from the beginning declared it to thee; &mdash;
<PB N="11" REF="003123_0008_0FF002B4B6F80968">
For I knew thou woulde&s;t deal very Treacherou&s;ly, &amp; wa&s;t called a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or from the womb.</HI> All appearance of Merit in them of &s;uch a di|&s;tingui&s;hing Favour, mu&s;t be utterly di&s;car|ded, &amp; the Re&s;olution of it mu&s;t be into the free Favour of GOD. He loved them becau&s;e he loved them. This is the Rea&s;on he him|&s;elf A&s;&s;igns, Deut. 7.7, 8. <HI>The Lord did not &s;et his love upon you, nor choo&s;e you, becau&s;e ye were more in Number than any People, (for ye were the fewe&s;t of all People) but becau&s;e the Lord Loved you.</HI> And &s;ince the Jews for their Unbelief have been di&s;own'd of GOD for a People, the Gentiles have been called in. But why, &s;ince they were covered with gro&s;s Idolatry? This was the good Plea&s;ure of his Will, to call in, and reveal a way of Sal|vation to tho&s;e that &s;ought not after it. Rom. 10.20. <HI>I was found of them that &s;ought me not; I was made manife&s;t to them that asked not after me.</HI> And in the Context the &s;ame Apo&s;tle &s;hews that the exceeding Riches of GOD's Grace is manife&s;t in calling &s;uch in, that were far off, Strangers from the Cove|nant of Promi&s;e, and having no hope and without GOD in the World; In the 7<HI>th.</HI> 12<HI>th</HI> and 13<HI>th ver.</HI> And why any Nations now lye in gro&s;s Darkne&s;s and Idolatry, and we enjoy the Go&s;pel Revelation, is not ow|ing to any Motive, rather to be found in us
<PB N="12" REF="003123_0009_0FF002B29DB34D50">
than in them. Our being called and not they, is to be re&s;olved into the Gracious pur|po&s;e of GOD. 2 <HI>Tim,</HI> 1.9.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>IT is from Grace, that any are Effectually prevailed upon to Believe in CHRIST, or to accept of Salvation by Him.</HI></P>
<P>THE great Gift of the SAVIOUR was perfectly free. The External di&s;covery of him to any, is perfectly free. So al&s;o is the overcoming any to whom the Go&s;pel is &s;ent, to receive this SAVIOUR from the free Grace of GOD.</P>
<P>IN this Particular Three things are Im|plied and may be di&s;tinctly Spoken to.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A Saving Faith in CHRIST is not the Product of Mans natural Powers.</HI></P>
<P>But,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THIS is wrought in the Soul by a Divine Power.</HI></P>
<P>And,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>THIS is done Freely.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A Saving Faith in CHRIST is not the Product of Mans Natural Powers.</HI></P>
<P>MAN in his natural Condition has not a Power &s;ufficient to Produce in him&s;elf a
<PB N="13" REF="003123_0009_0FF002B29DB34D50">
Saving Faith in CHRIST; &s;o that it can never be from him&s;elf that he has Saving benefit by him, though He be &s;et forth as a SAVIOUR before him in the Go&s;pel. For, although his under&s;tanding, may have &s;uch a conviction of that great Truth, That JESUS CHRIST was <HI>the Sent of GOD to take away the Sin of the World</HI>; and that the way of Salvation revealed in the Go&s;pel, is every way becoming the Glorious Perfecti|ons of the Great Author of it, as that he can't deny his a&s;&s;ent thereto; and this be al&s;o as much within the Compa&s;s of his Na|tural Powers, as to under&s;tand any Truth in Nature that may be propo&s;ed to him. Yet &s;uch <HI>a &s;ight of the Glory of GOD, in the Go&s;pel in the Face of his Son, as makes the Soul to re|ceive the Go&s;pel on a Divine account, to take CHRIST for Wi&s;dom, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Sanctifi|cation, and Redemption, and Transforms it into the Divine likene&s;s, renews us in the Spirit of our mind,</HI> and makes us <HI>to put off the Old Man,</HI> As the Apo&s;tle de&s;cribes Regeneration and the fruits of it, in <HI>Eph.</HI> 4&punc; 22, 23, 24. This is not from the &s;trength of his own rea&s;oning Powers. The &s;uppo&s;al of a <HI>&s;ufficiency of Strength in mens Powers to rai&s;e the Soul to this heigth, &s;eems Incon&s;i&s;tent with the de&s;ign of the Go&s;pel,</HI> which is to exalt Grace and aba&s;e the Sinner, &s;trip him of every thing whereof to
<PB N="14" REF="003123_0010_0FF002BE62966690">
Glory, to level every high Thought and I|magination with the Du&s;t, and as it were to Nullify Self. To this Truth al&s;o <HI>Experience gives in its Evidence</HI>: When the Soul faith|fully looks into, and views it &s;elf, what will it find but the Image of Satan upon it, in its Unregenerate &s;tate? a very Hell of un|cleanne&s;s in it &s;elf, full of deep &amp; un&s;earch|able Deceit, and Wickedne&s;s, full of Impeni|tency, Infidelity and Di&s;ability to Good; &amp; hearkens not, nor will be &s;ubject to the Law of GOD. But <HI>is full of Enmity thereto,</HI> as <HI>Joh.</HI> 8.44. <HI>Jer.</HI> 17.9. and <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.7&punc; And this <HI>Spiritual Death</HI> of the Soul, its Inherent and Univer&s;al Pravity, &s;uch are e&s;pecially <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> and <HI>di&s;tinctly Convinced of,</HI> to whom the <HI>Commandment has come with Power,</HI> As the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.9. And who&s;e under&s;tandings are opened to conceive the Spirituality, Penetration, and Compa&s;s of the Holy Law, which mea&s;ureth the frame, and every motion of the Soul. They abhor them&s;elves, and adore the Mercy that will &s;ave; and the Power that quickens them with a Divine Life.</P>
<P>AND this Truth is abundantly <HI>Confirmed by the Scriptures,</HI> in the account it gives us of Man in his Lap&s;ed &s;tate, Rom. 3&punc; 9,&mdash;18. <HI>Both Jews and Gentiles, They are all under Sin. There is none that Under&s;tandeth or &s;eeketh after
<PB N="15" REF="003123_0010_0FF002BE62966690">
GOD. None that doth good, no not one,</HI> &amp;c <HI>All are Conceived in Sin, and &s;hapen in Iniquity.</HI> P&s;al. 51.5. <HI>And go a&s;tray from the Womb,</HI> P&s;al. 58.3. <HI>Every Imagination of the Thoughts of his Heart is only evil continually. Gen.</HI> 6.5. Every Action of the mind, is <HI>only Evil,</HI> not one of its Motions being Pure, for it <HI>is every Imagination of the Thoughts,</HI> that is &s;aid to <HI>be only Evil</HI>; and at no time otherwi&s;e, for it is <HI>Continual,</HI> not a Habit contracted by Re|peated acts, but <HI>is &s;o from his Youth,</HI> as <HI>Gen.</HI> 8.21. Every act being Evil, proves the Frame and Temper of the Soul to be &s;o, whence the Actions &s;pring, otherwi&s;e every motion would not be irregular; whence it &s;eems no way po&s;&s;ible, that his recovery from &s;uch a &s;tate, &s;hould &s;pring from him|&s;elf: that &s;uch a Soul &s;o depraved can any more Determine it &s;elf to Holine&s;s, than an <HI>evil Tres, bring forth good Fruit; or a bitter Fountain &s;end forth &s;weet waters, Mat.</HI> 7 18. <HI>Jam.</HI> 3.11, 12. Thus the Apo&s;tle &s;ays Expre&s;ly, 1 Cor. 2.14. <HI>That the Natural man Receiveth not the things of the Spirit of GOD: for they are Fooli&s;hne&s;s unto him; neither can he know them, for they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned.</HI> Where he &s;eems manife&s;tly to Denominate Men from their better part, and to intend, not tho&s;e that would drown their Rea&s;on with their Lu&s;ts, but &s;uch rather as improve their Rea|&s;oning
<PB N="16" REF="003123_0011_0FF002B007304560">
Powers in all Kinds of Learning; Whom he ju&s;t before calls <HI>Wi&s;e Men, Scribes</HI> and <HI>Di&s;puters,</HI> That he might exclude every thing of natural or acquired Perfection; by which Humane Rea&s;on, by its own Strength, might arrive at this &s;piritual di&s;cerning of Divine Things; &amp; Such &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Reject the things of the Spirit of GOD;</HI> becau&s;e <HI>they &s;eem Fooli&s;hne&s;s to them, nor can they know them,</HI> he Adds; which denotes not the fault of their Sloth, and Negligence, as Though they might under&s;tand them, if they would exerci&s;e the Powers of their own Rea&s;on; but the Impotence it &s;elf, their Powers La|bour under, to under&s;tand them.</P>

<P N="2">2. <HI>THIS is wrought in the Soul by a Divine Power.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Truth is a&s;&s;erted here in the Text, that <HI>Faith is the Gift of GOD.</HI> Not of our &s;elves is our Salvation, nor our Faith, but as the Salvation, &s;o al&s;o the Faith (which is indeed a part of our Salvation) is the free Gift of GOD&punc; 'Tis not &s;aid a Power only

to believe, it is the Faith, the Believing it &s;elf that he is &s;aid to give. Man has not Faith before GOD gives it, otherwi&s;e it would not be GOD's Gift.

<P>SO al&s;o in Phil. 2 13. <HI>For it is GOD which worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good Plea&s;ure.</HI> This &s;peaks not of a Power meerly to do, but of <HI>an actual willing</HI> wrought by GOD. For it is &s;aid, <HI>GOD works in us to will</HI> and <HI>to do.</HI> If GOD <HI>works the willing</HI>; then it is not we work it. Nor have we it, till he works it. The kind of working here a&s;cribed to GOD, is &s;uch as actually produces the Effect of willing; not &s;uch a one as brings the Soul only into a kind of Indifferency or aequilibrio; that it may will, or not will&punc; For GOD can't be &s;aid to work Efficaciou&s;ly, or to Effect (as <HI>Energone,</HI> the Word there u&s;ed, &s;ignifies) the willing in us; unle&s;s the willing be Effected by him. Such an <HI>Exertion</HI> of the <HI>Divine Power upon the Soul,</HI> is <HI>here plainly a&s;&s;erted</HI> as <HI>Cau&s;es it to will; willing</HI> is certainly and nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;ed to follow; el&s;e nothing is wrought, and that &s;omething &s;hould be wrought, and yet no|thing

done, is a Contradiction. Nor does this offer Violence to the Soul, as being In|con&s;i&s;tent with its proper freedom, that GOD &s;hould &s;o exert his Power upon it, as that its believing, or willing, &s;hould nece&s;&s;a|rily follow upon it. Since Freedom of will in the Rational Creature, con&s;i&s;ts in a Pow|er of determining it &s;elf according to its own Perceptions. It follows that if it be made to apprehend ju&s;tly of its chief good, (of GOD as &s;uch) it mu&s;t choo&s;e it, and re&s;t in it, with the greate&s;t freedom and yet greate&s;t nece&s;&s;ity. To &s;uppo&s;e it Po&s;&s;ible for it to remain in aequilibrio, or to reject it, is to de&s;troy that very Power which is freedom it &s;elf. A Power to Determine Contrary to its own Perceptions, (as this would &s;up|po&s;e) Infallibly de&s;troys the e&s;&s;ential Con|&s;titution of the Souls Operation.</P>
<P>NOR will this Efficacious exerting of Di|vine Power upon the Soul, any ways &s;uppo&s;e that the actual willing, or believing is not Man's, for the <HI>willing</HI> is a&s;cribed to Man in the Text, and the <HI>Cau&s;ing of him to will,</HI> at the &s;ame time, is a&s;cribed to GOD.</P>
<P>OUR SAVIOUR's words to Nicode|mus, are al&s;o Expre&s;s in this ca&s;e, in <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.3&mdash;8. Where as our SAVIOUR informs

him, of the Outward way of admi&s;&s;ion into His Vi&s;ible Kingdom under a Go&s;pel Admi|ni&s;tration, was to be by Bapti&s;m, <HI>being born of Water</HI>; &s;o He lets him know that more than this, <HI>Even his being born again of the Spirit,</HI> was nece&s;&s;ary in order to his being a Sub|ject of His Invi&s;ible Kingdom; where CHRIST Reigns in the Hearts of men by His Grace, which in the mo&s;t appropriate &s;en&s;e is His Kingdom. <HI>Except a man be born of Water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of GOD. That which is born of the Fle&s;h, is Fle&s;h; and that which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit.

<P N="1">(1) FROM <HI>the Nature of the Divine Mind</HI>; To <HI>which every thing, and its own Re&s;olves, are Eternally and Unchangeably Pre&s;ent.</HI> Infinite Knowledge is a nece&s;&s;ary Perfection of the Divine Mind: it &s;eeth all things at once in one Comprehen&s;ive view.

<P N="2"><PB N="26" REF="003123_0016_0FF002A7EFBD67B0">(2) THIS Truth, may be al&s;o Argued, from the <HI>ab&s;olute Certainty there was from Eternity, of the accompli&s;hment of the End of CHRIST's Death.</HI> The End of CHRIST's Death, was to bring Glory to GOD in the Salvation of Sinners. It would be a great Reflection upon Infinite Wi&s;dom, to &s;uppo&s;e that GOD would &s;end his SON into the World upon any Po&s;&s;ible uncertainty, whe|ther ever that end would be an&s;wered, or not. Of Nece&s;&s;ity then, the de&s;ign of that great Work mu&s;t have been Ab&s;olutely, and in the Firme&s;t manner &s;ecured, &s;o that it could not po&s;&s;ibly fail. For if it was po&s;&s;i|ble for it to fail, then it might have failed, and &s;o CHRIST might have died in vain. There being then the highe&s;t Certainty of the Accompli&s;hment of this End, even equal to the Certainty of CHRIST's Death it &s;elf. It was then ab&s;olutely Determined by GOD; as it was that CHRIST &s;hould be a <HI>Saviour and that by his Death.</HI> as 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.10, 11. If then the end of GOD in CHRIST's Death, by his determination, be mo&s;t firmly and certainly Secured; it al&s;o thence follows, that the Salvation of &s;ome, a number of the fallen Race of Adam, is by his determination mo&s;t firmly A&s;certained; their Salvation, (or GOD's Glory in their Salvation) being this very de&s;ign, &s;o certainly &s;ecured.

For &s;ince this Salvation in every part of it is the Gift of GOD: there could not have been this Certainty from Eternity, of their being Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, unle&s;s by a Re&s;olve in the Divine Mind of &s;o be&s;towing it. Which Re&s;olve mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily Relate to the Individuals, on whom he will be&s;tow it; Since every Act of his, upon the Creature, &s;uppo&s;es a preceding Re&s;olve; and every Re&s;olve of GOD is Eternal and without Change.</P>

Tho&s;e Acts of GOD by which this is done were wholly at his Plea|&s;ure: The Security which they have from the Election &amp; the Promi&s;e of GOD, points them wholly to the Good Plea&s;ure of GOD. For what more free than the Act of GOD &s;ingling them out, and appointing them to Eternal Salvation? It was wholly at his Plea&s;ure to choo&s;e them or not. There was nothing of motive in them to it. It

Eph. 1.3, 4. <HI>According as he has Cho&s;en us</HI> It is Impo&s;&s;ible there &s;hould be any good in men before GOD gives it to them. And inconceivable then that they &s;hould have any, except he willed it, or that any thing in them &s;hould be the rea&s;on of his willing it to them. So that his Free Election of them, is the Spring of all the Grace they have. So al&s;o is the Promi&s;e free. This was his Gracious Plea&s;ure to make &s;uch a Promi&s;e to them: the Sove|reign Rich Grace of GOD is what Saints adore as the Fountain of all the good that is derived to them, of their Security, &amp; Pre|&s;ervation from all their Spiritual Enemies, unto the Eternal Kingdom of GOD. <HI>It is on|ly in GOD they Glory,</HI> &amp; <HI>Cry Grace, Grace.</HI></P>

&s;ince the Sinners Salvation is of Grace. It was an Act of Sovereign Grace, to &s;end a SAVIOUR into the World; It mu&s;t al&s;o be an Act of meer Grace the Publication of it to any of the Sons of men. There is no people on the Earth to whom this in a way of Ju&s;tice is due. It is of Grace, as hath been &s;hewn, that a SAVI|OUR is made known to any. The Chal|lenging of it as a Debt is Incon&s;i&s;tent with its being meerly of Grace. It is an Arbi|trary Di&s;pen&s;ation, depending purely upon the Plea&s;ure of GOD; and therefore no Wrong is done to tho&s;e that are &s;uffered to Live in the world without hearing of a SAVIOUR. Nor will they be able to Plead at la&s;t, it was a hard&s;hip, or any thing Un|equal, that they were Left without the Knowledge of a way of obtaining Pardon and Life; which was granted to Others that were Sinners as well as they.

the Kingdom of Heaven, is what they are particularly directed to: And without which they have no Encouragement, that Divine Grace will appear for their help. But none of this may be re&s;ted in. This Doctrine, That Salvation is wholly of the free Grace of GOD, gives no countenance to any to flatter them&s;elves, that becau&s;e they have done this or that, taken a great deal of pains in Religion, and with their own Hearts, that therefore GOD won't deny them Par|don, and Life: But beats them, from look|ing upon any thing they are, or do, as what can any ways move GOD or bind him to give Grace. For, if it is of Grace. <HI>If he gives it, only becau&s;e he will give it,</HI> Then not becau&s;e they do any thing; not becau&s;e of what they are, or do. Every thing of their own is nothing, as to the Motive of GOD's giving. Therefore every thing of our own is to be wholly Renounced, as any ways com|mending us to the Sovereign Mercy of GOD. The be&s;t we do in the matter of our Salva|tion &s;hould be accounted by us, as men&s;tru|ous Rags, and the entire Glory given to free Grace, that rai&s;es us from the mo&s;t filthy and Mi&s;erable State.

do not. Yet how common is it that &s;ome|thing of their own, or &s;omething they have done, or are doing, which Terminates in Self, is a ground of their Confidence. 'Tis directly contrary to Corrupt Nature to Re|nounce Self; and to own all its Salvation depends upon the Meer Plea&s;ure of GOD, and mu&s;t &s;pring from pure Mercy; and therefore is trying many ways to bring GOD as it were under &s;ome Obligation to grant it. By various methods natural Men at|tempt to bring GOD under &s;ome Tie or In|ducement to be&s;tow Salvation upon them, which Evidence they don't Renounce Self, and their loathne&s;s to it. Some may be ju&s;t hinted at:</P>

But the Heart of GOD is not moved to exerci&s;e Mercy from what Men <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. He does it freely, becau&s;e it Plea&s;es Him.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="003123_0022_0FF002A6252D1ED0"><HI>SOME Per&s;ons by endeavouring to make their Hearts better, hope to Induce GOD to exerci&s;e Mercy towards them.</HI> They Imagine if they could get &s;ome good di&s;po&s;itions in their Hearts, that GOD would be plea&s;ed with them. But tho' Sinners may get their Hearts greatly affected with &s;orrow for their Sins, and have many Religious affections, yet their Hearts are really no better than they were before. There is nothing but Sin there, in its full Reign, and this lifting up of them&s;elves, upon their&punc; Religious frames, evidences the Pride of their Hearts, and their oppo&s;ition to the free Grace of GOD.

<P><HI>SOME hope to gain the Favour of GOD by the Services and Duties they do in Religion.</HI> Many fancy the Anger of GOD towards them may be Pacified in this way, and if they are Con&s;tant in Duties and Religious Services, that they &s;hall in time move GOD towards them and procure his Grace. But this is &s;till bringing Self as a ground, or mo|tive, for Free Grace to act upon, Which finds nothing without it &s;elf to move it: Self and every thing relating to it is therefore to be renounced, GOD is Gracious always of his own accord, Nothing of ours procures

What was it fir&s;t looked up|on us, but the Eternal rich Grace of GOD? And what hath it done for us? Even that which Infinitely Tran&s;cends our thoughts. When we had made our &s;elves Slaves of Sin, and Satan, and Children of the Cur&s;e it gave a Redeemer, the Eternal Son of GOD, to Ran&s;om us from De&s;truction: to break in pieces the Policy, and &s;trength of Hell; and Re&s;cue us from the vile&s;t Servitude, and the greate&s;t Mi&s;ery.

Yet that amazingly Rich Grace, delighted in de&s;igning, and accom|pli&s;hing the work of his Grace in us. What can all this de&s;erve, and call for? All we have and can do is Infinitely below it. And what is the lea&s;t, but a Thankful Admiration of it. What GOD expects is that we own it: That we be willing he &s;hould Save us Freely.
