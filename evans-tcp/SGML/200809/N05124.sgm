<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>ALMOST every one of the&s;e <HI>E&s;&s;ays</HI> was written above twenty Years ago, and &s;ome of them more than thirty. The Author finds Rea&s;on to offer his &s;incere Acknowledgments and Thanks to Almighty God, who has pre|&s;erved him, even to this Day, in the &s;ame Sentiments and Principles of <HI>Chri&s;tian Faith and Love,</HI> amid&s;t the numerous Follies and Errors of the Times.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e Papers indeed, found its way into the World the very Year in which it was written; the very De&s;ign of it was to exemplify the Title of this Book,
<PB N="iv" REF="006440_0005_1028EF153AAB0B00">
and it has been often &s;ince &s;ollicited to be printed again: But it was delay'd for many Years, till the Author had formed a Collection of Papers of this Sort large enough to compo&s;e a moderate Volume; and the Reader will be &s;ufficiently inform|ed of the pre&s;ent Rea&s;on of this Publica|tion, by a mere explaining of the Words of the Title, <Q>Orthodoxy and Charity united.</Q></P>
<P>By the Word <HI>Orthodoxy,</HI> the Author means all tho&s;e <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Doctrines which were generally approved in the la&s;t Age, &s;o far as he knows at lea&s;t, by almo&s;t all the <HI>Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in the Nation; even tho&s;e great Doctrines on which the <HI>Reformation</HI> from the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> was built; and they continued &s;o all the time the&s;e <HI>E&s;&s;ays</HI> were writing, and long before, in the general good E&s;teem of the Churches, as being conformable to the In|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">uctions of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his <HI>Apo&s;tles.</HI> It
<PB N="v" REF="006440_0006_1028EF16CB6E7F98">
is needle&s;s in this Place to reckon them all up particularly, but in general they were &s;uch as the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. By the Fall of the fir&s;t Man, he, together with his Po&s;terity, lo&s;t their In|nocence and their Immortality, their Bo|dies were &s;ubjected to Di&s;ea&s;es and Death, their natural Inclinations were perverted from that which is good, and there was a &s;trange prevailing Bia&s;s in human Na|ture, even from its Infancy, to that which in Evil.</P>
<P N="2">2. In order to their Recovery from this Ruin, there is not only a Nece&s;&s;ity of the Pardon of their Sins, and Recon|ciliation of their Per&s;ons to God, but there is need al&s;o that their &s;inful Natures be healed, and renewed by &s;anctifying Grace, in order to re&s;tore Men to Virtue and Piety, <HI>i. e.</HI> to the Love of God and their Fellow-Creatures.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="vi" REF="006440_0007_1028EF1946B2EB88">3. The Son of God, who in the Lan|guage of Scripture is <HI>one with the Father,</HI> came down from Heaven to take Fle&s;h, and therein to fulfil the Duties of the Law, and give an Example of perfect Ho|line&s;s: And then he was appointed to &s;uffer Death as a Sacrifice and Atonement for the Sins of Men, that Mankind might thereby obtain Pardon and the Favour of God.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is a Nece&s;&s;ity al&s;o that Sin|ners &s;hould heartily repent of their Sins, return to God, and be renew'd to the Principles and Temper of Holine&s;s, in order to their complete Recovery to Eter|nal Life and Happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="5">5. Be&s;ides this Repentance and Return|ing to God, it is al&s;o required that they believe in the Name of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> their Saviour, or tru&s;t in him with a humble Expectation of the Favour of God through him: And 'tis through this Faith they
<PB N="vii" REF="006440_0008_1028EF1BA5375BE8">
are to be ju&s;tified and accepted of God.</P>
<P N="6">6. They are al&s;o obliged to obey the Law of God, as far as this feeble and Im|perfect State admits of, during their whole Life, and &s;till to grow up towards Perfec|tion therein.</P>
<P N="7">7. When &s;uch Per&s;ons die, their Souls are convey'd to a State of Peace and Re&s;t in the Pre&s;ence of God, till the great Day of the Re&s;urrection, when their Bodies &s;hall ri&s;e again from the Dead, and the whole Per&s;on, Body and Soul, be made happy for ever in the Favour and Pre&s;ence of God their Maker.</P>
<P>The&s;e Doctrines were generally pro|fe&s;s'd at the time of the <HI>Reformation,</HI> by <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> abroad and at home, and the&s;e are the Sett of Principles which have been u&s;ually called <HI>Orthodoxy</HI> or right Senti|ments.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="006440_0009_1028EF1D2F295188">Now it has unhappily fallen out, that many of tho&s;e who have received and profe&s;s'd the&s;e important Doctrines, have differ'd al&s;o in many le&s;&s;er Points, &s;uch as the <HI>Logical</HI> Relations of &s;ome of the&s;e Doctrines to one another, that is, <HI>Whether Faith or Works</HI> be <HI>Conditions or Con&s;e|quents of their Ju&s;tification and Accep|tance; what is the e&s;&s;ential Difference be|tween the Covenant of Works and the Co|venant of Grace,</HI> or the <HI>Law and the Go&s;pel,</HI> &amp;c. as well as in &s;everal particular Practices of <HI>divine Wor&s;hip,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Cere|monies, Ve&s;tures, impo&s;ed Forms of Prayer,</HI> &amp;c. and they have &s;o far quarrelled about the&s;e Things as too much to neglect and abandon that <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Love and Charity they ought to have maintained, according to their general Acknowledgement of the great and nece&s;&s;ary Truths and Rules of Chri&s;tianity, and hereby they have in many In&s;tances lo&s;t that Duty and Character of good <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> (viz.) to <HI>Love one ano|ther.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="006440_0010_1028EF205FB1A1D8">Now &s;ince the&s;e unhappy and unchari|table Practices, even among&s;t &s;ome good Men, have prevail'd even to this Day, it is the De&s;ign of the&s;e <HI>E&s;&s;ays</HI> to endeavour the Recovery of the&s;e Per&s;ons, who unite in the&s;e Principles, to charitable Senti|ments and Practices towards one another.</P>
<P>Here it will be very natural to enquire, Where is there found among&s;t all the&s;e <HI>E&s;&s;ays,</HI> any Attempt to reconcile tho&s;e to the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Love and Charity of others, who while they profe&s;s the <HI>Chri&s;tian Re|ligion,</HI> yet oppo&s;e, renounce or deny the great Doctrines of the atoning Sacrifice of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> or his Propitiation for Sin by his Death?</P>
<P>All the An&s;wer that can be given is this: The Author would gladly have done it, that the whole Book might be of a Piece, and every Page might overflow with Love, if he could, after the turning over his New Te&s;tament, have met with
<PB N="x" REF="006440_0011_1028EF23F2674260">
any evident In&s;tances, or Examples, any plain Rules or Requirements of &s;uch <HI>Chri|&s;tian</HI> Charity expre&s;&s;ed towards Per&s;ons of this Character in all the &s;acred Writings.</P>
<P>But the Language of Scripture gives no Encouragement to &s;uch a Charity; for this Doctrine is not any where number'd a|mong the doubtful Di&s;putables of our Re|ligion, the le&s;&s;er Things of Chri&s;tianity, &s;uch as <HI>Meats</HI> and <HI>Drinks,</HI> and Ob&s;erva|tion of <HI>Days,</HI> and <HI>outward Forms</HI> of Wor|&s;hip; but it is &s;poken of as a matter of far higher Importance, and I think &s;eems to be nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> it&s;elf.</P>
<P>This Doctrine contains in it the highe&s;t and the kinde&s;t De&s;ign toward Men, for which our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour came down from Heaven; 'twas for this very Rea&s;on he came into this World, (<HI>viz.) to give his Life a Ran&s;om for</HI> Sinners, <HI>Matth.</HI> xx. 28. and 'tis repeated in <HI>Mark</HI> x. 45. So that
<PB N="xi" REF="006440_0012_1028EF269C22FCD8">
tho&s;e who depart from and renounce this Article, renounce the kinde&s;t De&s;ign of the Coming and the Death of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and they &s;eem, by the Words of the holy Writings, to be expo&s;ed to another &s;ort of Sentence, from which may the Grace of God recover and pre&s;erve them!</P>
<P>In the mean time, I hope tho&s;e who heartily unite in their Sentiments of the&s;e great Doctrines which I have mentioned, and maintain a corre&s;pondent Practice of &s;trict Holine&s;s and Dependance upon <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> our great High-Prie&s;t, and our Sa|crifice, will be taught by &s;ome of the&s;e Papers, to learn the Duties of <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Love more perfectly, agreeable to the ori|ginal De&s;ign of the holy Founder of our Religion.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be ob&s;erved here, that though the chief part of the&s;e <HI>E&s;&s;ays</HI> were written at the time which is mention'd, yet there happen to be now and then a few Lines
<PB N="xii" REF="006440_0013_1028EF2826BBE0D8">
or Pages, and &s;ome few Citations from el|der or later Authors, which were not all written or in&s;erted at that time.</P>
<P>Let it be ob&s;erved al&s;o, that all the Cha|racters here mentioned are general and in|definite; and there is not one Character or Name, that is now written in the&s;e Papers, or ever was, that was de&s;ign'd to be apply'd to any particular Per&s;on: For the Author avoided it with Care in all the&s;e Writings, and in all his Reviews of them, that no &s;ingle Per&s;on what&s;oever &s;hould be &s;o particularly de&s;cribed, as to imagine him&s;elf to be intended, and much le&s;s to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by any Reader. May the divine Ble&s;&s;ing attend every hum|ble Attempt to e&s;tabli&s;h the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Faith, and to confirm and enlarge our Love. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<P>THE Word, <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> is u&s;ed in more Sen&s;es than one. Sometimes it &s;ignifies the Hi&s;tory of the Life and Doctrine, the Death and Re|&s;urrection of Chri&s;t. So <HI>Mark</HI> i. 1. <HI>The Begin|ning of the Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Christ the Son of God.</HI> And &s;o 'tis u&s;ed in common Speech, when we call the Writings of the four Evangeli&s;ts <HI>the four Go&s;pels.</HI> But in the mo&s;t proper and u&s;ual Sen&s;e of it in Scripture, it &s;ignifies a <HI>Di&s;covery of Divine Mercy, through a Mediator, to Mankind fallen into Sin and Mi&s;ery</HI>; therefore in <HI>Greek</HI> it is called <HI>Evaggelion,</HI> or <HI>Glad Tidings.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Name indeed, as derived from its <HI>Saxon</HI> Original, &s;ignifies only the <HI>Word of God</HI>: Yet it is now peculiarly applied to the <HI>Word of his Grace,</HI> which re|veals Salvation to &s;inful and mi&s;erable Man, and therefore it is often called the <HI>Covenant of Grace.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="006440_0017_1028EF3263AB5518">This Salvation is made up of many Benefits or Ble&s;|&s;ings, Part of which are be&s;towed in this World, and the re&s;t in the World that is to come. The Revelation of the&s;e Benefits, and of the Foundation on which they &s;tand, and of the Way whereby we come to be Partakers of them, is the <HI>Matter, Sum</HI> and <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> of the Go&s;pel, in its mo&s;t general Notion among Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>This Go&s;pel was not revealed all at once in its full Glory to Mankind. There have been &s;everal Editions of it, or gradual Di&s;coveries of this Grace in all the former Ages of the World.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as ever <HI>Adam</HI> had &s;inned, and ruined him&s;elf and his Po&s;terity too, by laying the Foundation of their Sin and Mi&s;ery, it plea&s;ed God to publi&s;h this Go&s;pel by the Promi&s;e of a Saviour, when he told our Mother <HI>Eve,</HI> that <HI>her Seed &s;hould brui&s;e the Head of the Serpent</HI> that had deceived her, <HI>Gen.</HI> iii. 15. This, by our Divines, is u&s;ually called <HI>the fir&s;t Go&s;pel</HI>; for, in the modern Lan|guage of the New Te&s;tament it &s;ignifies, that <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hould come into this World to de&s;troy the Works of the Devil,</HI> 1 John iii. 8.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s <HI>Noah,</HI> the &s;econd Father of Mankind, had &s;ome farther Di&s;coveries made to him, when the Rainbow was appointed as the Seal of a gracious Covenant be|twixt God and Man: For the very Promi&s;e of the Continuance of the comfortable Sea&s;ons of the Year, being given to Man in a Way of Mercy, do imply that God would not be irreconcileable to his fallen Creatures. Nor can we rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e but that <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Noah,</HI> and all tho&s;e mo&s;t ancient Patriarchs, had larger Explications and Comments of the fir&s;t Promi&s;e given them than <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> has recorded.</P>
<P>This Go&s;pel was renewed by Revelations made to <HI>Abraham,</HI> when the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> the Saviour, was pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">d to &s;pring out of his Family; <HI>in thy Seed &s;hall all Nations of the Earth be ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> Which Promi&s;e is expre&s;ly called

the <HI>Go&s;pel, Gal.</HI> iii. 8. There was al&s;o a Type or Pattern of our Ju&s;tification by Faith in the Way of the Go&s;pel, when <HI>Abraham believed God</HI> in his Promi&s;es, and <HI>it was imputed to him for Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Rom. v. 3.</P>
<P><HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had a much larger Di&s;covery of the Grace and Mercy of God toward &s;inful Man made to him, and to the <HI>Jews</HI> by him, than all the Patriarchs put toge|ther: And this was not only done in the Types, and Figures, and Ceremonies, not only in Altars, Sacrifices, Wa&s;hings, Sprinklings, Purifications, and in their Re|demption from <HI>Egypt,</HI> their miraculous Salvations in the Wilderne&s;s, and their &s;afe Conduct to <HI>Canaan,</HI> the Land of promi&s;ed Re&s;t; but he had many literal and expre&s;s Revelations of pardoning and &s;anctifying Grace, which are &s;cattered up and down in the five Books which he wrote, and which he gave to the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to direct their Religion. This is al&s;o called <HI>the Go&s;pel,</HI> Heb. iv. 2. <HI>To them was the Go&s;pel preached as well as unto us,</HI> as tho&s;e Words ought to be tran&s;lated. This &s;ame Go&s;pel was afterward confirmed, illu&s;trated and enlarged by &s;ucceeding <HI>Prophets</HI> in the &s;everal Ages of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church.</P>
<P>But <HI>God, who at &s;undry Times and in divers Manners &s;poke</HI> this Go&s;pel <HI>to our Fathers by the Prophets, has in the&s;e later Days</HI> publi&s;hed the &s;ame to us in a brighter Manner, <HI>by his Son Je&s;us,</HI> the promi&s;ed Saviour, <HI>Heb.</HI> i. 1 And &s;ince the Death and Re&s;urrection of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> the Apo&s;tles being &s;ent by their exalted Lord, have given yet plainer and fuller Declarations of this Go&s;pel to the Children of Men.</P>
<P>And upon this Account it is &s;everal Times called the <HI>Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t,</HI> not only becau&s;e the Offices and Grace of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> run through the whole of it, but al&s;o becau&s;e the cleare&s;t Di&s;coveries of it are made to the World by <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and by his Me&s;&s;engers the Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>Now, from this la&s;t and fulle&s;t Revelation of it in
<PB N="4" REF="006440_0019_1028EF3679DDF318">
the New Te&s;tament, we may derive a fuller and more perfect Knowledge of the Go&s;pel than all the former Ages could attain. Hereby we learn, that the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> is a <HI>Promi&s;e of Salvation from Sin and Hell, by the Death, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to every one that is &s;incerely willing to accept of it by coming to Chri&s;t, or tru&s;ting in him</HI>; and it includes al&s;o <HI>the promi&s;ed Aid of the Holy Spirit to tho&s;e who &s;eek it, to enable them to receive this Salvation, and to fit them for the final Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the promi&s;ed Glory.</HI> It includes al&s;o the <HI>Revela|tion of the future Re&s;urrection, the la&s;t Judgment and eternal Life.</HI> To this End did the <HI>Son of God come into the World, that who&s;oever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elieves on him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting Life,</HI> John iii. 16.</P>
<P>This may be made out and explained more at large in the following Manner.</P>
<P>The <HI>Salvation</HI> which the Go&s;pel propo&s;es, is exactly an&s;werable to our pre&s;ent State of Sin and Wretched|ne&s;s, and fully &s;upplies all the Nece&s;&s;ities of fallen Man, his Guilt and de&s;erved Mi&s;ery, his &s;inful and cor|rupted Nature, and his utter Inability to help him&s;elf; and therefore it mu&s;t contain in it Holine&s;s and Happi|ne&s;s, with divine Directions and divine Aids in order to attain them. The <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> of it is a Freedom from that Death and Puni&s;hment which we had incurred by Sin, and a Recovery to the Favour of God which we had lo&s;t, and everla&s;ting Joy therein. The <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> of it is the Image of God in which we were at fir&s;t created, which Image was defaced and ruined by Man's fir&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Foundation of this Salvation is the eternal Mercy and Goodwill of God the Father, to his poor, peri&s;hing, &s;inful Creatures, by the glorious Undertaking and various Tran&s;actions and Offices of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t as Mediator, and the &s;everal Operations of the Ble&s;&s;ed Spirit.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="006440_0020_1028EF3ADAD6D598">This Salvation, in the whole of it, is contrived and appointed by the various Attributes of God, e&s;pecially his Wi&s;dom, Power and Goodne&s;s, exerting them&s;elves for this Purpo&s;e: 'Tis purcha&s;ed or procured for us by the Death and Sufferings of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> 'Tis applied to us by the Work of the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>We are cho&s;en to partake of all this Salvation, both the Holine&s;s and Happine&s;s of it, by the eternal Good|will of the Father. We are recovered to the Favour of God, and Happine&s;s, by the Obedience or Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>the Death and Interce&s;&s;ion of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> who is the Son of God in our Nature. We are re&s;tored to the Image of God and Holine&s;s by the <HI>Spirit of Chri&s;t,</HI> that is promi&s;ed and &s;ent down into this World, to change our Hearts and reform our Lives, and thereby fit us for the heavenly Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>But what are we to do that we may become Partakers of this Salvation? For it is not every Son and Daughter of <HI>Adam</HI> who are Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of it. Now it is the Go&s;pel that reveals this to us, and al&s;o <HI>directs</HI> us in it. The appointed Way to partake of this Salvation is by <HI>Be|lieving or Tru&s;ting in Chri&s;t;</HI> that is, when from a deep Sen&s;e of the Evil of Sin, and our Guilt and Danger on that Account, we grow weary and heavy laden with the Burden of our Sins, and &s;urrender or betru&s;t our&s;elves to the Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> that by his Death and Obedi|ence we may be &s;aved from Hell, and be accepted unto eternal Life, and that by the <HI>divine Aid</HI> of his Spirit, we may have all the &s;inful Powers of our Natures re|newed and &s;anctified, and fitted for that Life eternal which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> has purcha&s;ed. Thus you &s;ee this Grace of Faith nece&s;&s;arily draws along with it &s;incere Repen|tance for Sin, and De&s;ires after true Holine&s;s.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider that we are by Nature afar off from God, ignorant and aver&s;e to all that is holy, we &s;hall find that we are not more able to believe unto
<PB N="6" REF="006440_0021_1028DAD1D4A9DF08">
Salvation, nor to repent of Sin, at fir&s;t, than we are to perform Works of Holine&s;s afterwards. Therefore this Go&s;pel provides us with divine Strength to fulfil the&s;e Duties; <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is <HI>our Strength,</HI> as well as <HI>our Righteou&s;|ne&s;s.</HI> He is <HI>exalted to be&s;tow Repentance</HI> as well as <HI>For|givene&s;s</HI>; and <HI>Faith is the Gift of God, who creates us anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good Works,</HI> I&s;a. xlv. Acts v. Eph. ii. and makes us holy by his Spirit, as is before expre&s;t. 'Tis by the Holy Spirit con&s;idered eminently as the <HI>Spirit of Chri&s;t,</HI> that we are enabled to receive this Sal|vation at fir&s;t, and trained up and prepared for the full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>It is further al&s;o comprehended in this <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> and promi&s;ed in this <HI>gracious Con&s;titution of God,</HI> that when we have fini&s;hed our State of Trial on Earth, our Souls &s;hall be received at Death into the Pre&s;ence and Enjoy|ment of God; and our Bodies al&s;o &s;hall be rai&s;ed from the Grave in the great Re&s;urrection Day, and thus our whole Natures &s;hall be made happy together to all Eternity.</P>
<P>This is the <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Subject</HI> of the gracious Re|velation of God, this the <HI>Method of Salvation,</HI> and the Manner of our partaking of it, which is appointed by God him&s;elf, and this is what I call the <HI>Sub&s;tance of the Go&s;pel.</HI> There are &s;ome other Points of Importance that belong to it, but this is the Foundation of all, and comprehen&s;ive of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>To &s;um up the &s;everal Parts of it in as few Words as I can, <HI>the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t</HI> is a gracious Con&s;titution of God for the Recovery of &s;inful Man, by &s;ending his own Son in the Fle&s;h to obey his Law, which Man had broken, to make a proper Atonement for Sin by his Death, and to procure the Favour of God, and eternal Happine&s;s for all that believe and repent and receive this offered Salvation, together with a Promi&s;e of the Holy Spirit to work this Faith and Repentance in the
<PB N="7" REF="006440_0022_1028EF3FC7AD1A68">
Hearts of Men, to renew their &s;inful Natures unto Ho|line&s;s, to form them fit for this Happine&s;s on Earth, and to bring them to the full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in Heaven.</P>
<P>All this is &s;o evident from a Variety of Scriptures that might be cited here, that one would think there &s;hould be no need to prove it. But there have been &s;ome Per&s;ons in the la&s;t and in the prefect Age (I chiefly intend the <HI>Socinian</HI> Writers, and tho&s;e <HI>nominal Chri&s;tians</HI> who are leaning toward <HI>Dei&s;m</HI>) who would impoveri&s;h and curtail the <HI>Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t,</HI> and make it to con&s;i&s;t in little more than mere <HI>natural Religion.</HI> Some of the&s;e Per&s;ons ju&s;t make a Shift to per&s;uade them&s;elves to believe the <HI>Bible,</HI> or at lea&s;t they profe&s;s to believe it, becau&s;e it is the Religion of their Country, but they explain it in &s;o poor, &s;o narrow, &s;o dry, and in&s;ipid a Manner as rai&s;es it very little above the <HI>Light of Nature,</HI> viz. <Q>That if we follow the Dictates of our inward Rea&s;on and our Con&s;cience, in wor&s;hipping God, and in loving our Neighbours, according to the Rules which Scripture hath given us to explain and confirm the Light of Nature, and herein imitate the holy Example of our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> then our Sins &s;hall be forgiven us by the meer Mercy of God, through the Supplication and Interce&s;&s;ion of &s;o good a Man as <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and we &s;hall be accepted to eternal Life;</Q> and this without any Dependance on the <HI>Death of Chri&s;t</HI> as a proper Atonement or Satisfaction for Sin, or any Regard to him as a true and real Sacri|fice. And as for the <HI>Spirit of God,</HI> and his Almighty Operation on the Souls of Men, to enlighten and &s;anc|tify them, at lea&s;t in our Age, this is almo&s;t bani&s;hed out of their Go&s;pel, and finds but little room in their Religion.</P>
<P>I think it nece&s;&s;ary therefore to prove, that the <HI>Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t</HI> is &s;uch a Doctrine as I have de&s;cribed; and that I &s;hall do by the&s;e five Rea&s;ons.</P>

<P N="1">I. This Doctrine, which I have now mentioned, of the Re&s;toration of Believers in <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> to the Favour of God, by the atoning Sacrifice and Obedience of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and the renewing of &s;inful Men to God's Image by the Work of the Holy Spirit, and thereby bringing them to eternal Life, is the very Go&s;pel of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> be|cau&s;e <HI>it is the very Labour and Bu&s;ine&s;s, the chief Scope, Aim and De&s;ign of the great Apo&s;tle of the</HI> Gentiles, <HI>in tho&s;e of his Epi&s;tles where he &s;ets him&s;elf profe&s;&s;edly to ex|plain the Go&s;pel; and this is what he takes frequent Occa&s;ion al&s;o to bring into all his Writings.</HI> It is his perpetual Labour to in&s;truct the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> in the&s;e glo|rious and unknown Truths: He u&s;es various Forms of Speech to explain them to their Under&s;tandings; for <Q><HI>I de&s;ire,</HI> &s;aith he, and <HI>determine to know nothing among you but</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>and him crucified, i. e.</HI> nothing like it; nothing in Compari&s;on with it. It is the <HI>Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t,</HI> that is and mu&s;t be the great Subject of my Mini&s;try; this is what I am &s;ent to preach, for it is the <HI>Power of God, and the Wi&s;dom of God, for the Salvation of Men.</HI></Q> Rom. i. 16. 1 Cor. i. 24. <HI>and</HI> ii. 2.</P>
<P>You find his Letters to the Churches full of &s;uch Ex|pre&s;&s;ions as the&s;e, <HI>Chri&s;t died for our Sins. He gave him&s;elf for us to redeem us from all Iniquity. We have Redemption thro' his Blood. God was in Chri&s;t reconciling the World to him&s;elf, not imputing their Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es to them. He was made Sin, and a Cur&s;e for us. He is our Propiti|ation,</HI> and <HI>Atonement. He appeared to put away Sin by the Sacrifice of him&s;elf. When we were Enemies we were re|conciled to God by his Death. He made Peace by the Blood of his Cro&s;s. He was delivered for our Offences, and rai&s;ed again for our Ju&s;tification. By the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of one Man the free Gift came upon all Men to Ju&s;tification of
<PB N="9" REF="006440_0024_1028EF43D38CAB50">
Life. By the Obedience of one, &s;hall many be made Righ|teous; and we are ju&s;tify'd by Faith in him. He teaches us al&s;o the Offices of the Holy Spirit. We have Acce&s;s to God thro' his Spirit. We are purified and &s;anctified by the Spirit.</HI> 'Tis <HI>by the Spirit of Chri&s;t that</HI> we are to <HI>mortify the Deeds of the Fle&s;h. We are led by the Spirit</HI>; and we are <HI>taught</HI> to under&s;tand this Go&s;pel <HI>by the Spirit which he hath given us. We are &s;ealed by this Spirit unto the Day of Redemption. The Spirit dwelling in us</HI> is a Pledge and <HI>Earne&s;t</HI> of our <HI>Inheritance in Heaven.</HI> Rom. viii. 13.

<P>Now the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions of his are to be under&s;tood in the common Sen&s;e and Meaning of the Words, and not as far-fetch'd Metaphors; for it is evident, that in all this he does not affect the Arts of Oratory, nor a&s;&s;ume a magnificent Air, of Writing, nor does he rai&s;e him&s;elf into Sublimities of Style, nor rove in an En|thu&s;ia&s;tick Way, when he treats of the&s;e Subjects; but while he is explaining to us the&s;e great Things of the Go&s;pel, he avoids <HI>the Wi&s;dom of Words</HI> and Oratory, and he talks in a plain rational, and argumentative Method to inform the Minds of Men, and give them the cleare&s;t Knowledge of the Truth.</P>
<P>Surely a Per&s;on that was &s;ent of God to preach and write the Go&s;pel for the U&s;e of all Nations and future Ages, and even for the ignorant and unin&s;tructed <HI>Bar|barians,</HI> would not have expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in this &s;ort of Language, if he meant no more by it than the <HI>So|cinians</HI> do by the Go&s;pel of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>; that is, <Q>that the Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> was a very great Man, but a mere Man &s;till; he was a Prophet ordained of God to preach up Holine&s;s in greater Degrees than it had been before preached, to &s;ettle &s;ome Points which were left a little doubtful by the Light of Na|ture, to a&s;&s;ure us that God would be reconciled to Man, and forgive him, if Man repented and was
<PB N="10" REF="006440_0025_1028EF46AC8EE410">
&s;orry for his Sins, and lived as well as he could for time to come; and that for the Sake of the Prayers of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> who was &s;o very pious, &s;o very religious and &s;o very heavenly a Per&s;on, and &s;o &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive in his Sufferings to the Will of God, he would favour the Penitent among Mankind with &s;ome Ble&s;&s;ings and Comforts in this World, and eternal Life in the World above. Then when he had preached this Doctrine to the World, he &s;uffer'd the Death of the Cro&s;s, to bear witne&s;s to the Truth of it, and &s;eal'd it with his Blood, and ro&s;e again for a further Confir|mation of the &s;ame Doctrine.</Q> Now if this were all the meaning of the <HI>Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t,</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI> would never have preached it in &s;uch Language as he did. We mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e him to be a very unaccurate Writer, a mo&s;t unintelligible Preacher and a mo&s;t unfit Man to be made an Apo&s;tle, and be &s;ent to in&s;truct the ignorant World, if he had expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in &s;uch my&s;terious, figurative, and &s;trange Phra&s;es, and all this while had meant no more by them than what the <HI>Socinians</HI> mean by their Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Can we think God would have employed &s;uch an In|&s;trument as this was, who&s;e Way of Talking would have rather deceived Multitudes than informed them of the Truth, would have led them into the Dark rather than have given them Light, would have filled their Heads with my&s;terious Words without Ideas, and in|&s;tead of leading them into the Way of Salvation, would have left them in bewildered Thoughts about the Doc|trines and Duties of it with &s;o much Entanglement and Confu&s;ion?</P>
<P>Here I might add al&s;o, that the holy Apo&s;tle not only in&s;tructs his own Countrymen the <HI>Jews,</HI> and the <HI>Gentile</HI> Strangers in this divine Doctrine, and teaches them to build their Hopes of Salvation upon it; but <HI>he ventures his own Soul, his immortal Concernments, and
<PB N="11" REF="006440_0026_1028EF48770AFCF8">
his everla&s;ting Hopes upon the &s;ame Foundation.</HI> He <HI>glories in the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t,</HI> he has <HI>committed his All</HI> into his Hands <HI>till the great</HI> Judgment <HI>Day; he lives by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved me,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>and gave him&s;elf for me,</HI> Gal. vi. 14. 2 Tim. i. 12. Gal. ii. 20. 'Tis the Plea&s;ure of his Tongue, 'tis the Joy of his Pen, 'tis the Delight and the Life of his Spirit to talk of tho&s;e Things: He hangs upon this Subject, and knows not how to leave it; his very Heart and Soul is in it, and he abandons all Things for the Sake of this Knowledge. He de&s;pi&s;es the former Privileges of his Birth, of his Learning, of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Prerogatives and Rites. He renounces all his Legal and Ceremonial Perfection, and all his Honour among&s;t the Prie&s;ts and the Phari&s;ees in Compari&s;on of this. <HI>What Things were Gain to me,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>tho&s;e I count Lo&s;s for</HI> Chri&s;t: <HI>Yea, doubtle&s;s, and I count all Things but Lo&s;s for the Excellency of the Know|ledge of</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us <HI>my Lord, for whom I have &s;uffered the Lo&s;s of all Things, and do count them but Dung that I may win</HI> Chri&s;t, <HI>and be found in him, not having mine own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of</HI> Chri&s;t, <HI>the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of God by Faith; that I may know him and the Power of his Re&s;urrec|tion, and the Fellow&s;hip of his Sufferings, being made con|formable unto his Death,</HI> Philip. iii. 7, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Nor is the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ingular in this Re&s;pect, or different in his Sentiments from the other Apo&s;tles. You find <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> &s;aying the &s;ame Things in their Epi&s;tles; and they take every Occa&s;ion to publi&s;h the &s;ame Go&s;pel and the &s;ame Promi&s;es and Hopes of Salvation by the Death and Sacrifice of our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and by the enlightening and &s;anctifying Opera|tions of the &s;ame <HI>Spirit.</HI> It would be endle&s;s to cite all the Proofs of this. Now, 'tis not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that the three chief Writers among the Apo&s;tles &s;hould all con&s;pire to talk in the &s;ame my&s;terious and unin|telligible
<PB N="12" REF="006440_0027_1028EF4A0AA90100">
Language, &s;o widely different from the com|mon and obvious Sen&s;e and Meaning of their Words, if they intended no more by them than the <HI>Socinians</HI> mean by their <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> which is very little different from the Way of Salvation that the <HI>Dei&s;t</HI> propo&s;es, while they deny the <HI>Satisfaction of Chri&s;t,</HI> and his real and proper <HI>Atonement for Sin,</HI> and the powerful <HI>&s;ancti|fying Influences</HI> of the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P N="2">II.

<P>The Prophecies of the Old Te&s;tament are various and many: Some of the cleare&s;t of tho&s;e which relate to the Sufferings and Atonement of Chri&s;t, and to our Ju&s;tification by him, are expre&s;t by <HI>Daniel, I&s;aiah</HI> and <HI>Jeremiah.</HI> By <HI>Daniel</HI> we are told that the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah &s;hall he cut off, but not for him&s;elf,</HI> and the De&s;ign of this is <HI>to fini&s;h Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, to make an End of Sin,</HI> to make <HI>Reconciliation for Iniquities,</HI> and to <HI>bring in everla&s;ting Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Daniel ix. 24, 26. <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> &s;peaks the &s;ame thing more largely, Chri&s;t <HI>was wounded for our Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions. He was brui&s;ed for our Iniquities. The Cha&s;ti&s;e|ment of our Peace was upon him,</HI> and <HI>by his Stripes we are healed. We like Sheep have gone a&s;tray, and the Lord hath laid on him the Iniquity of us all. It plea&s;ed the Lord to brui&s;e him and put him to Grief, and to make his Soul an Offering for Sin.</HI> By the Knowledge <HI>of him &s;hall he ju&s;tify many, for he &s;hall bear their Iniquities.</HI> How ex|ceeding plain and &s;trong is this Language to &s;upport this Doctrine. <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> liii. 5, 6, 10, 11. <HI>In the Lord &s;hall
<PB N="13" REF="006440_0028_1028EF5056221F58">
we have Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Strength: In the Lord &s;hall all the Seed of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>be ju&s;tified and &s;hall glory,</HI> I&s;aiah xlv. 24, 25. And the Prophet <HI>Jeremy</HI> expre&s;ly calls <HI>Chri&s;t the Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Jerem. xxiii. 6.</P>
<P>The Promi&s;e of Sanctification by the Spirit of God, is given us in <HI>Ezek.</HI> xxxvi. 26, 27. <HI>A new Heart will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you; I will put my Spirit within you, and cau&s;e you to walk in my Statutes, and ye &s;hall be my People and I will be your God.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;ort of Language is repeated <HI>Chap.</HI> xi. 19. and <HI>Jerem.</HI> xxxii. 39, 40. <HI>Jerem.</HI> xxxi. 31, 32, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which is cited by the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> in his Epi&s;tles to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> and to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> as the Language of the Go&s;pel, or the new Covenant. Now it is ma|nife&s;t enough, that all the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions of glorious Grace, and of the Method of our Reconciliation to God, our Sanctification and Salvation could never be an&s;wered and accompli&s;hed without &s;uch a Go&s;pel of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as we have de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The Rights and Ceremonies of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church &s;peak the &s;ame thing, if we con&s;ider them as Types and Figures of the Go&s;pel-&s;tate. I will grant indeed that many of tho&s;e Ceremonies had al&s;o &s;ome other Intendments (<HI>viz.</HI>) to di&s;tingui&s;h the Nation of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and their Religion, from the <HI>Gentile</HI> World, and the fanta&s;tical Inventions of <HI>Pagan</HI> Wor&s;hip: To keep them in Subjection to God as their political Head or King: Several of their Sacrifices and Methods of Purification were appointed to clean&s;e them from ceremonial De|filements, and to atone for Civil or Political Crimes, whereby they were admitted to their Civil Rights again, and their Place in the Congregation, when they had done any thing to forfeit them.</P>
<P>But 'tis evident by the Writings of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> in 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> Chap. iii. <HI>Gal.</HI> Chap. iv. <HI>Colo&s;&s;.</HI> Chap. ii. <HI>Heb.</HI> Chap. vii, viii, ix, x. that the great End of the&s;e <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI>

ceremonial Appointments was to &s;tand as Types and Figures of things under the Go&s;pel, and Emblems of the various Offices and Benefits of our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Now in this figurative or Emblematical Sen&s;e, what did all the Sacrifices and the Blood mean, the burning Bea&s;ts and the &s;moaking Altars, whereby the <HI>Jews</HI> made a typical Atonement for their Sins? What were they Tyes of, what did they repre&s;ent, if not the Sacrifice of <HI>Chri&s;t?</HI> And what means the &s;prinkling all the People with the Blood of Animals, if the&s;e things did not ty|pify and repre&s;ent our being clean&s;ed by the Blood of our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> which is therefore called the <HI>Blood of &s;prinkling,</HI> and which is the only real and &s;ub&s;tantial Atonement for Sin? What meant their laying the Hand upon the Goat that was to bear their Iniquities, and the Confe&s;&s;ion of the Sins of all <HI>I&s;rael</HI> over his Head, if they did not de&s;ign to foretel the transferring of the Sins of Men upon the Head of our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> the Surety and the Sacrifice for Sinners? What did the Wa&s;hings of Water imply, but the pouring out of the Holy Spirit upon &s;inful Men, and the Purification of their Natures by Divine Grace? Why did that glo|rious and divine Light dwell in the Tabernacle and in the Temple, and between the <HI>Cherubims</HI> in the Holy of Holies, if it were not an Emblem of the <HI>Fulne&s;s of the Godhead dwelling bodily</HI> in the Man <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> in and by whom God was to conver&s;e vi&s;ibly with the Children of Men? Can any Man be &s;o ab&s;urd as to believe, in Oppo&s;ition to &s;o many Expre&s;&s;ions of the Apo&s;tle in his Letters, that the&s;e Sprinklings of Water and of Blood, the&s;e bleeding Lambs and burning Goats and Bullocks, the&s;e Vails, Curtains and Tabernacles &s;erved for nothing el&s;e but to wrap up the Duties of the Light of Nature in them, and to explain (or rather to darken) the common Truths of natural Religion? And yet the Apo&s;tle tells us in &s;everal Places, that the&s;e were Types
<PB N="15" REF="006440_0030_1028EF5536116288">
<HI>or Figures</HI> of the Go&s;pel of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Surely every Shadow bore the Shape and Figure of the Sub&s;tance: Every Vail and Covering was fitted to the Body. All the&s;e were but <HI>Shadows,</HI> but <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is the <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> or the <HI>Body,</HI> and the Shape of the Body appeared therein to tho&s;e that had divine Light to di&s;cern it, and e&s;pecially to us, whom St. <HI>Paul</HI> has taught to under&s;tand many of the&s;e My&s;teries.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e therefore who impoveri&s;h the Go&s;pel of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as &s;ome Writers have done, and deny tho&s;e glorious Doctrines that are included in it, they deny that Go&s;pel which was foretold by the Prophets, that Go&s;pel which was hidden in the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Shadows, and they re|fu&s;e to &s;ee it, though it be now broken forth into open Light.</P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t</HI> mu&s;t needs be &s;uch a Doc|trine as we have before de&s;cribed, it mu&s;t needs be &s;o far &s;uperior to all the Dictates of the Light of Nature, and to de&s;erve tho&s;e glorious Characters which the Apo&s;tle frequently gives it, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That it is the <HI>Wi&s;|dom of God in a My&s;tery,</HI> 1 Cor. ii. 7. <HI>The great My&s;tery of Godline&s;s,</HI> 1 Tim. iii. 16.

And it <HI>contains the un&s;earchable Riches of</HI> Chri&s;t, Eph. iii. 8. And <HI>Trea&s;ures of Wi&s;dom and Knowledge,</HI> Col. ii. 3.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="006440_0031_1028EF57D860A578">Now &s;uch &s;ort of De&s;criptions as the&s;e are very ap|plicable to the Doctrine of the <HI>Son of God,</HI> who is al&s;o <HI>one with the Father,</HI> and who is <HI>God ble&s;&s;ed for evermore,</HI> coming down to join him&s;elf to Fle&s;h and Blood that he might be able to die in the room and &s;tead of &s;inful Men, and that this glorious Per&s;on, <HI>by whom the Worlds were made,</HI> and all the Ho&s;ts of Men and Angels, <HI>Col.</HI> i. 15. that he &s;hould be made a Sacrifice for our Sins, that God might declare his un&s;potted Holine&s;s, or Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, his terrible Ju&s;tice, and his unchangeable hatred of Sin, even <HI>while he forgives</HI> Sinners, and <HI>ju&s;tifies tho&s;e that believe in Je&s;us,</HI> Rom. iii. 24, 25. and that this Lord <HI>Je&s;us</HI> in human Nature &s;hould ri&s;e from the Dead, a&s;cend to Heaven, be exalted to the <HI>Government of all things vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible,</HI> Eph. i. 22, 23. &s;hould &s;end his Spirit down to work Faith, Repentance and Holine&s;s in all his cho&s;en and redeemed ones, and carry them through a thou&s;and Temptations and Difficulties, and through Death it&s;elf to Heaven and Glory. This is the Doc|trine that human Rea&s;on could never have found out, and has much ado to be per&s;uaded to receive it now it is manife&s;ted in the New Te&s;tament. The&s;e are Wonders of un&s;earchable Wi&s;dom, and an Entertain|ment for prying Angels.</P>
<P>But if the Go&s;pel of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;ignify no more than the mere Promi&s;e of Pardon to tho&s;e that Repent of their Sins, and believe <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> to be a true Prophet, and follow the Example and Commands of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> who has explained and confirmed the Light of Nature, what is there in this that de&s;erves &s;uch a Catalogue of glorious Titles as the Apo&s;tle be&s;tows upon this Go&s;pel? There's no &s;uch great and deep Contrivance, &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing Wi&s;dom in &s;uch a Covenant of Grace, as does nothing el&s;e but abate the &s;evere and rigid Terms of the Cove|nant of Works, and make Repentance and imperfect Obedience to &s;erve in&s;tead of perfect Obedience, in order to obtain Pardon and Happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="006440_0032_1028EF5AB3E37280">I confe&s;s there was need of &s;ome divine Revelation to a&s;&s;ure us that God would accept of our Repentances and our hone&s;t Endeavours, when in his Law he de|mands Perfection. But this any common Prophet might have done, being &s;ent of God and &s;upported by Mira|cles, as <HI>Elijah</HI> and <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> were. And when once this Doctrine was thus plainly revealed, there would be no great Difficulty to per&s;uade Men to receive it, there are no &s;uch &s;ublime My&s;teries and Depths of Wi&s;dom and Knowledge contained in it; nor does it need any ex|traordinary <HI>Genius,</HI> much le&s;s Divine Wi&s;dom it&s;elf, to have been the Inventor of it.</P>
<P>But far be it from us to have &s;uch a dimini&s;hing Thought of the glorious <HI>Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. Another Rea&s;on that I &s;hall give to prove that the <HI>Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t</HI> is &s;uch a Doctrine as I have before de&s;cribed, is the Opinion both of the <HI>Jews and Gentiles</HI> concerning it, and the Treatment that it met with both in <HI>Judea</HI> and among&s;t the Nations.</P>
<P>'Twas counted <HI>Fooli&s;hne&s;s by the</HI> Greeks, or the learned <HI>Heathens,</HI> and it was a <HI>Stone of &s;tumbling to the</HI> Jews. We <HI>preach Chri&s;t crucified to the</HI> Jews a <HI>&s;tumbling Block, and to the</HI> Greeks <HI>Fooli&s;hne&s;s,</HI> 1 Cor. i. 23. Whereas if the Doctrine of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> crucified had implied no more in it than this, that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> by his Death and Martyrdom on the Cro&s;s, bore a Te&s;timony to the Truth of the Doctrine which he preached, and that Doctrine was nothing el&s;e but a Di&s;covery of God's Readine&s;s to ac|cept of Sinners that repented and obeyed him, as well as they could, out of his mere Mercy; the <HI>Jews</HI> could never have been &s;o much &s;hocked or offended at it, for they believed as much as this long before St. <HI>Paul</HI> ever preach'd: Nor could the learned <HI>Greeks</HI> have counted that Doctrine <HI>Folly</HI> which the wi&s;e&s;t of their Philo&s;ophers &s;eemed to under&s;tand and teach. This &s;ort of Go&s;pel would have been &s;o little different from
<PB N="18" REF="006440_0033_1028EF5D49268F50">
what the Light of Nature might lead them probably to expect and hope for, that &s;urely they would not have endeavoured to expo&s;e it and ridicule it, but rather they would have fallen in with St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Sermons, as being agreeable to many of their Sentiments. That Go&s;pel therefore which both the <HI>Jews</HI> and the <HI>Greeks</HI> were &s;o much offended with, that they reproach'd it as Mad|ne&s;s and Folly, mu&s;t be &s;omething &s;trange to their Ears, and exceedingly different from their own Opinions.</P>
<P N="5">V. I may add al&s;o at la&s;t, that if St. <HI>Paul</HI> had meant no more by the <HI>Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t</HI> than this, that God was willing to be reconciled to Mankind, if they would repent of their Sins, and be &s;orry for them, and liv'd as well as they could for Time to come, there had been very little Rea&s;on for him to &s;peak of his Courage in preaching it &s;o often as he does, and that with &s;uch an <HI>Empha&s;is,</HI> Rom. i. 16. <HI>I am not a&s;hamed of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, for it is the Power of God unto Salvation;</HI> and he repeats it again. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> i. 12. and encourages young <HI>Timothy</HI> to preach the &s;ame Go&s;pel, <HI>with Boldne&s;s, and not be a&s;hamed of Chri&s;t,</HI> nor his Mini&s;ters. He counts it a great thing, that he could <HI>glory in the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, Gal.</HI> vi. 14. and in his Doctrine of <HI>Chri&s;t crucified,</HI> and is re&s;olved to &s;pread the Savour of it round the World. <HI>I am not a&s;hamed of this Go&s;pel, I am ready to preach it</HI> among the <HI>Jews</HI> or the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> or in the City of <HI>Rome</HI> it&s;elf. <HI>Rom.</HI> i. 15. Now if he had preached nothing but the <HI>Socinian</HI> Go&s;pel, there was nothing in it that would have expo&s;ed him to much Shame and Reproach for the Hopes of Forgivene&s;s, upon meer Repentance; and the Enforcement of the Duties of Natural Religion, with a little Illu&s;tration and Advance upon them, was much like the Go&s;pel or Doctrine of the wi&s;e&s;t of the <HI>Heathen</HI> Philo&s;ophers, that he had almo&s;t been e&s;teemed one of tho&s;e wi&s;e Men, and rather treated with Honour among&s;t them at <HI>Athens,</HI> and in other <HI>Gentile</HI> Cities,
<PB N="19" REF="006440_0034_1028EF5FD3C700E8">
and not been reproached as a <HI>&s;etter forth of &s;trange Gods,</HI> and called a <HI>Babbler</HI> for his Preaching of &s;uch &s;ort of Doctrines.</P>
<P>But when the Apo&s;tle preaches the <HI>Son of God in the Likene&s;s of Man,</HI> that came down from Heaven, not to &s;et up a Throne in the World, and rule per&s;onally over the Nations, but to be expo&s;ed to Shame and Pain, to be nail'd to a Cro&s;s, and have a Crown of Thorns put upon him, and indure all the&s;e Sufferings for the Sins of Mankind: When he tells the Heathen World of a Man that was hang'd upon a Tree at <HI>Je|ru&s;alem,</HI> and a&s;&s;ures them, that his Death is the Foun|dation and Spring of Eternal Life, to all that believe on him; when he preaches, that the <HI>Lord of Glory was crucified,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> ii. 8. that &s;o the wor&s;t &s;ort of Sinners might be &s;aved, and <HI>that he who knew no Sin was made a Sacrifice for our Sins, that we might</HI> &s;tand Righteous in the Sight of God thro' his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> v. 21. This was &s;omething that &s;ounded &s;o &s;trange in the Ears of the <HI>Heathens,</HI> and the blinded <HI>Jews</HI> too, that they multiplied Reproaches upon the Ser|mons and the Preacher. And St. <HI>Paul</HI> thought it a con&s;iderable Point gained, when he could a&s;&s;ume &s;uch a Degree of Courage as to be able to &s;ay, I dare preach among&s;t the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> the <HI>Jews,</HI> the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> and the <HI>Philo&s;ophers</HI> at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and at <HI>Rome</HI> &s;uch a Go&s;pel as this is; <HI>for I am not a&s;ham'd of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</HI> This is an Argument which, in my Opinion, carries much Evidence with it, that the <HI>Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t</HI> is &s;uch a Doctrine as I have before de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>But here is a con&s;iderable <HI>Objection</HI> ari&s;es again&s;t this De&s;cription of the Go&s;pel. How can the <HI>Atonement</HI> for Sin by the Death of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> be &s;o con&s;iderable a Part of the Go&s;pel, when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf, the great Prophet of his Church &s;poke &s;o &s;eldom and &s;o very little of it during the whole Cour&s;e of his Mini&s;try.

<P>Tho' there be a very large and particular An&s;wer given to all the Parts of this Objection in tho&s;e Ser|mons; particularly, <HI>Sermon</HI> the 35th, yet &s;ince it &s;eems to carry &s;ome con&s;iderable Force in it, I would mention &s;ome Hints of Reply in this Place.</P>
<P N="1">I. The great De&s;ign of our Saviour in his publick Appearance and Mini&s;try on Earth, was to prove him|&s;elf to wear the true Characters of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> to de|liver the <HI>Jews</HI> from many fal&s;e Expo&s;itions and Glo&s;&s;es which the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> of that Day had given to &s;everal Parts of Scripture, to lead the World to a Conviction of their Sins, and thereby prepare them to receive the Doctrine of Salvation with more Zeal and De&s;ire; whereas the Salvation it&s;elf, and the Manner whereby it was accompli&s;hed, was but briefly men|tioned in &s;ome few Texts, and the re&s;t was left to be explained by his Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P N="2">II. The Doctrine of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Atonement for Sin is, indeed, intimated in &s;everal Places of his own Mini|&s;trations (<HI>viz.</HI>) Matt. xx. 28. <HI>The Son of Man came not to be mini&s;ter'd unto, but to mini&s;ter, and give his Life a Ran&s;om for many.</HI> John x. 15. <HI>I lay down my Life for the Sheep.</HI> John vi. 51. <HI>The Bread which I will give is my Fle&s;h, which I will give for the Life of the World.</HI> And when he in&s;tituted the Holy Supper, Luke xxii. 19. <HI>He took Bread and brake it, &s;aying, This is my Body which is
<PB N="21" REF="006440_0036_1028EF66AA1C0398">
given for you.</HI> And as in St. <HI>Matthew</HI>'s Go&s;pel, <HI>This Cup is my Blood of the New Te&s;tament which is &s;hed for many for the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. This Doctrine of Atonement for Sin by his Death, as a Sacrifice, and the Acceptance of it with God the Father, could not be &s;o well preached in Pub|lick, before tho&s;e very Facts were fulfilled, upon which this Doctrine is founded; for his Death was the Foundation of this Atonement; his Re&s;urrection and A&s;cen&s;ion to Heaven, were the Proofs of its being ac|cepted with God: Now it might have appear'd pre|po&s;terous to our Saviour, who was divinely wi&s;e, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">each the&s;e Doctrines freely in Publick to the Multi|tude, before the&s;e Events appear'd in the World.</P>
<P>And even to his own Di&s;ciples he was not too free in the Communication of them, becau&s;e, as <HI>John</HI> xvi. 12. He told them, <HI>he had many Things to teach them, but they could not bear them yet</HI>: It might have been the Means of rai&s;ing &s;ome Prejudices in the Minds of his own Di&s;ciples; whereas he re&s;erved &s;ome of the&s;e Things to be taught in tho&s;e forty Days, while he continued with them after his Re&s;urrection, and <HI>&s;pake with them of the Things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.</HI> Acts i. 3.</P>
<P>And thence we may infer, that if we would learn the plaine&s;t and fulle&s;t Account of the Go&s;pel of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> 'tis not enough for us to con&s;ult merely his publick Sermons, or the Hi&s;tories of his Life, which are called the Four Go&s;pels, but we mu&s;t read carefully the Writ|ings of the Apo&s;tles, after he went to Heaven; in which they taught the&s;e Doctrines more compleatly, which they had learnt from the Conver&s;e of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> after his Re&s;urrection, as well as by the pouring out of his own Spirit upon them in great Abundance, as he had promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>But there is another <HI>Objection,</HI> which is borrowed from the <HI>Socinian</HI> Writings, which it may be proper to
<PB N="22" REF="006440_0037_1028EF6833FD1CD0">
give &s;ome Reply to (<HI>viz.) That it does not agree to the moral Perfections of God to puni&s;h Sin in a Surety; nor does it become the great God who is a Being of infinite Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s and Equity, to appoint &s;uch a Way of Sal|vation for Men,</HI> as would nece&s;&s;itate an innocent Creature to be expo&s;ed to &s;o many &s;harp Sufferings as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> un|derwent, while the guilty Sinner &s;uffers nothing of all the&s;e Terrors, but is deliver'd from the &s;evere&s;t of them by the Death of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to this, I de&s;ire it may be con&s;ider'd, that this Doctrine of the Expiation and Atonement for Sin by <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> is &s;o plainly and expre&s;ly revealed and declared in the New Te&s;tament, by the Apo&s;tles <HI>Paul, Peter,</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> as has been already &s;hewn, and is &s;o frequently repeated in many Forms of Speech in the Sacred Writ|ings, that it &s;eems a very bold Imagination to &s;uppo&s;e, that that could not be <HI>agreeable to the moral Perfections of God,</HI> or that <HI>it could not become God</HI> to appoint that, which in &s;o many repeated Scriptures, is expre&s;ly a&s;|&s;erted to be done by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and by the Appoint|ment of the Father. Can it be ever imagined, that the Great God did not know what would become every one of his Perfections better than we little In&s;ects, ju&s;t crept out of the Earth, and returning thither again, could teach him? Can it be ever thought, that the Eternal Mind did not know what was decent for a ju&s;t and a wi&s;e God to do, better than we can conceive or &s;ugge&s;t?</P>
<P>I <HI>an&s;wer,</HI> in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Place, that &s;ome of the very Ex|pre&s;&s;ions wherein this Doctrine is repre&s;ented in Scrip|ture are &s;uch as &s;eem to be de&s;igned on purpo&s;e to ob|viate this very Objection, particularly 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> v. 21. <HI>God has made him to be Sin for us who knew no Sin, that we might be made the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him,</HI> i.e. he made him to be a Sacrifice for Sin for us, that we might be deliver'd from the Guilt of Sin, and accepted as righ|teous

John</HI> x. 18. And he had an <HI>additional Exaltation</HI> promi&s;ed him on this Account, <HI>Heb.</HI> xii. 2. and actually be&s;tow'd on him for this Ser|vice: <HI>Phil.</HI> ii. 9. <HI>Wherefore God hath highly exalted him,</HI> be&s;ides &s;everal other Events in the Divine Scheme of God's Government, for the Glory of God, and the Happine&s;s of Men.

<P>It is my Opinion concerning many of the Debates about our Religion, that they may be &s;ufficiently deter|mined for the Peace and Practice of Chri&s;tians, by finding out the various U&s;e of Words in common Language, and e&s;pecially the Sen&s;e of them in the holy Scriptures, and &s;ubmitting our Judgments and Con&s;ciences to this Sen&s;e of them, with a little reconciling Explication.

this noi&s;y Controver&s;y may, perhaps, come nearer to a Deci&s;ion, if we will but hone&s;tly con&s;ult the Ways of &s;peaking, that the Scripture u&s;eth in &s;olving the&s;e three following <HI>Que&s;tions.</HI></P>
<P>But before I propo&s;e them, I would beg one Favour of my Readers, and that is, as they run over the&s;e Pages, they would &s;o far deny them&s;elves of a common Cu&s;tom, as not to examine and judge of this little <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> by any Sy&s;tems or Orthodoxy in their Clo&s;et, or in their Head, but by the only Sy&s;tem, out of which I have drawn it, the Holy Bible; for in the whole Compo&s;ure of this Di&s;cour&s;e, I have not con&s;ulted one Author be&s;ides; and I would chu&s;e to be read ju&s;t in the &s;ame way in which I write, and to be judged by the &s;ame Rule. I proceed now to name the three following <HI>Que&s;tions.</HI></P>
<P><LABEL>QUESTION I.</LABEL> <HI>Whether the Go&s;pel be an Ab&s;olute or a Conditional Promi&s;e?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> The <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> in its mo&s;t general Sen&s;e may be de&s;cribed as a Declaration of the free Mercy of God, for the Salvation of fallen Man by a Mediator.</P>
<P>As Man by his Fall hath lo&s;t the Image of God and his Favour, Salvation includes the Recovery of both the&s;e: It implies therefore Repentance, Regeneration, Holine&s;s and Per&s;everance, as well as Ju&s;tification, Adoption and Glorification; we mu&s;t be &s;aved from our Sins, as well as from the Wrath of God, if we are made truly happy. <HI>Je&s;us</HI> the Mediator <HI>&s;aves his People from their Sins.</HI> Matt. i. 21. as well as <HI>delivers from the Wrath to come.</HI> 1 The&s;. i. <HI>ult.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e &s;everal Ble&s;&s;ings included in Salvation, tho' they are all be&s;towed freely by Grace, yet have a Con|nexion one with another, and Dependance on each other; therefore &s;ome of them are repre&s;ented as fore|going,
<PB N="27" REF="006440_0042_1028EF74B6652BC0">
others as following; &s;ome as Means, the others as the End. Faith, Repentance, Regeneration, Par|don, Ju&s;tification, Adoption, Sanctification, Obedi|ence, the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Holy Spirit, and Per|&s;everance, may all be e&s;teemed as Means, with regard to the great and final Ble&s;&s;ing of Glorification, which is the End; and indeed, every foregoing Ble&s;&s;ing may be reckoned in &s;ome Sen&s;e, as a Means with regard to that which follows.</P>
<P>Again, &s;ome of the Ble&s;&s;ings included in Salvation, are to be wrought in us, as Repentance, Sanctification, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Others to be only be&s;towed upon us, as Pardon of Sin, Adoption, Eternal Glory, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Tho&s;e that are to be wrought in us, are &s;ometimes &s;et forth in Scrip|ture, as Duties to be performed by us, to &s;tir us up in a rational way to &s;eek them; and tho&s;e that are only to be be&s;tow'd upon us, are &s;et forth as Ble&s;&s;ings to be confer'd in con&s;equence upon &s;uch Duties performed; for God will &s;ave us &s;till as intellectual Creatures, under a moral Government, and will have our rational Powers u&s;ed in obtaining and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing this Salvation; and therefore it is &s;ometimes &s;et forth as a propo&s;ed Agreement between two intelligent Beings, God and Man, and is called the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> a <HI>better Covenant,</HI> and the <HI>Word of Reconciliation.</HI> Heb. viii. 8. <HI>and</HI> viii. 6. 2 Cor. v. 19.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Con&s;iderations the Go&s;pel or Covenant of Grace is &s;ometimes repre&s;ented as a mere Declara|tion of Grace, or an ab&s;olute Promi&s;e in Scripture, and &s;ometimes as a conditional one. It is repre&s;ented <HI>Ab&s;olutely</HI> in the&s;e Texts, <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 8. <HI>The Scripture fore&s;ee|ing that God would ju&s;tify the Heathen through Faith, preached before the Go&s;pel unto</HI> Abraham, <HI>&s;aying, In thee &s;hall all Na|tions be ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> Heb. x. 16, 17. <HI>This is the Covenant that I will make with them after tho&s;e Days, &s;aith the Lord; I will put my Laws into their Hearts, and in their Minds will I write
<PB N="28" REF="006440_0043_1028EF764B1639F0">
them: And their Sins and Iniquities will I remember no more.</HI> Though the Word <HI>Covenant</HI> does u&s;ually &s;ignify an En|gagement on both &s;ides, yet 'tis &s;ufficiently evident, that in the Language of Scripture it does not always imply Re&s;tipulation or mutual Agreement; for 'tis ap|ply'd to the Day and the Night, and their &s;tated Cour&s;es, to the Bea&s;ts of the Field, as Inhabitants of this Earth, <HI>Jer.</HI> xxxiii. 20, 25. <HI>Gen.</HI> ix. 9, 10.</P>
<P>All the Ble&s;&s;ings of the Go&s;pel, both the Means and the End, are repre&s;ented in a way of free or ab&s;olute Donation by the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> frequently. So <HI>Eph.</HI> ii. 8, 9. <HI>By Grace ye are &s;aved through Faith, and that not of your &s;elves, it is the Gift of God, not of Works, &mdash; for we are his Workman&s;hip,</HI> &amp;c. In other places of Scripture the Go&s;pel is repre&s;ented in a <HI>Conditional</HI> way, as Mark xvi. 15, 16. <HI>Preach the Go&s;pel to every Creature, he that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI> Matt. xi. 28. <HI>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you Re&s;t,</HI> John vii. 37. <HI>If any Man thir&s;t, let him come unto me and drink,</HI> 1 John i. 9. <HI>If we confe&s;s our Sins, he is faith|ful and ju&s;t to forgive us our Sins,</HI> &amp;c. The&s;e are properly called <HI>conditional</HI> Propo&s;itions in a logical or rational View of the Relations of things.</P>
<P>And it may be ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e very parts of our Salvation which in one Scripture are commanded as <HI>Duties,</HI> in another are promi&s;ed as <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings.</HI> So Faith&punc; and Repentance are <HI>Duties</HI> required. <HI>Mark</HI> i. 15. <HI>Re|pent and believe the Go&s;pel:</HI> They are <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> be&s;towed, <HI>Phil.</HI> i. 29. <HI>To you it is given to believe,</HI> Acts v. 3. <HI>God hath exalted him &mdash; to give Repentance</HI>: And it is ea&s;y to bring in&s;tances of the like Nature concerning &s;everal other parts of our Salvation.</P>
<P>Now according to the Di&s;tinctions I have laid down, the foregoing Ble&s;&s;ings which are as Means, may be e&s;teemed <HI>Conditions</HI> with regard to others which are as the End of them: So Ju&s;tification and Adoption, as
<PB N="29" REF="006440_0044_1028EF7C2E89C5C8">
well as Faith and Repentance, and Per&s;everance, all which are as Means, may be called <HI>Conditions</HI> in regard of Glorification which is the la&s;t End. In that golden Chain of Salvation, <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 30. Calling, Ju&s;tifica|tion, and Glorification are three great Links. <HI>Whom he called, them he al&s;o ju&s;tified: And whom he ju&s;tified, them he al&s;o glorified.</HI> But all agree if we are not called, we &s;hall not be ju&s;tified: If we are not ju&s;tified, we &s;hall not be glorified. Thus every Ble&s;&s;ing of Salva|tion that in the nece&s;&s;ary order of Nature follows another, may be &s;aid to be &s;u&s;pended on that other, as a <HI>Condition</HI> without which it &s;hall not be be&s;towed.</P>
<P>Again, tho&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings that are repre&s;ented as our Duties, and are to be wrought in us, may be &s;aid to be <HI>Conditions</HI> with regard to con&s;equent Ble&s;&s;ings that are only conferred upon us: (for the word <HI>Condition,</HI> in its mo&s;t common Sen&s;e, does by no means imply that it mu&s;t be performed by our own Power, not does it in|clude any thing of a valuable Con&s;ideration or Merit in it.) And therefore in this Sen&s;e, Faith may be called a <HI>Condition of Ju&s;tification,</HI> becau&s;e Faith and Ju&s;tification are connected together in Scripture, and Faith is re|pre&s;ented as a foregoing Ble&s;&s;ing, and as a Duty, Ju&s;tification as a con&s;equent Ble&s;&s;ing, and a Privilege which is &s;u&s;pended upon it. Gal. ii. 16. <HI>Knowing that a Man is not ju&s;tified by the Works of the Law, but by the Faith of</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>even we have believed in</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>that we might be ju&s;tified.</HI> So the U&s;e of Water is a Condition of being made clean, &s;o com|ing to the Fire is a Condition of being warmed, &s;o the putting on a Garment is a Condition of being clothed, receiving a &s;ealed Pardon is the Condition of a Pri&s;oner's Relea&s;e, committing the Body to a Phy|&s;ician is the Condition of a &s;ick or dying Man's being healed: And in this Sen&s;e Faith is called a Condition of our Intere&s;t in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> by the A&s;&s;embly of Divines in
<PB N="30" REF="006440_0045_1028EF7DB9A04608">
their larger Catechi&s;m under the <HI>Que&s;tion, How is the Grace of God manife&s;ted in the &s;econd Covenant?</HI> <Q><HI>An&s;w.</HI> The Grace of God is manife&s;ted in the &s;econd Co|venant, in that he freely provideth and offereth to Sinners a Mediator, and Life and Salvation by him, and requiring <HI>Faith</HI> as the <HI>Condition</HI> to intere&s;t them in him, promi&s;eth and giveth his Holy Spirit to all his Elect, to work in them that Faith with all other &s;aving Graces, and to enable them unto all holy Obe|dience, as the Evidence of the Truth of their Faith and Thankfulne&s;s to God, and as the way which he hath appointed to Salvation.</Q></P>
<P>Nor can I &s;ee any &s;ufficient Rea&s;on why the Grace of <HI>Faith,</HI> as a <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> conferr'd, may be called the Condi|tion of a following Ble&s;&s;ing, and yet Faith, con&s;ider'd as a Duty, may not be called a Condition of the &s;ame Ble&s;&s;ing, &s;ince both the Habit and the Act of Faith are the Effects of Divine Grace working in us and by us; and where Faith is propo&s;ed as a Duty, it is repre&s;ented more evidently in a conditional way than where 'tis mentioned as a mere Ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>And upon the &s;ame account, Holine&s;s and Per&s;eve|rance may be called the Conditions of our compleat Salvation in Heaven, becau&s;e Holline&s;s and Per&s;everance are foregoing Ble&s;&s;ings and Duties, and compleat Sal|vation in Heaven is the final Privilege, <HI>Heb.</HI> xii. 14. <HI>Without Holine&s;s no Man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord.</HI> Matt. xxiv. 13. <HI>He that endures to the End &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI> Nor doth Dr. <HI>Owen,</HI> nor other moderate Writers in this Con|trover&s;y, refu&s;e the u&s;e of the word <HI>Condition</HI> in &s;uch a Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>What I have &s;aid concerning the various Ble&s;&s;ings of the Go&s;pel or new Covenant, may be apply'd al&s;o to the Seals or Symbols of it, <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> and the <HI>Lord's Supper.</HI> The&s;e are Seals on God's part, which he hath appointed for the Confirmation of our Faith, by the
<PB N="31" REF="006440_0046_1028EF8096F1B7E0">
Help of our Sen&s;es, and that he might give us, as it were, a real Pledge of the Performance of his Promi&s;es. Thus Abraham <HI>received Circumci&s;ion a Seal of the Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of Faith,</HI> Rom. iv. 11. Thus we receive Bapti&s;m as a Seal of our Regeneration by the Holy Spirit: Thus the Lord's Supper as a Seal of our Pardon and Life by the Crucifixion and Death of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> But as great Privileges as they are, thus granted to us, we mu&s;t remember they are al&s;o Duties to be per|formed by us, and are Seals on our part of our En|gagement to be the Lord's. Nor have we any Rea&s;on to expect the Comforts that ari&s;e from the&s;e &s;ealed Ble&s;&s;ings of the Go&s;pel if we wilfully de&s;pi&s;e and neglect the u&s;e of the Seals: And in this Sen&s;e they may be called Conditions of the Privileges, and Comforts that are annexed to them.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire it here to be noted, that I &s;peak not this to encourage and promote the common u&s;e of the word <HI>Condition</HI> in the&s;e Ca&s;es; for it is not u&s;ed in Scripture, except once in a Parable; and that not in the Original, but only in our Tran&s;lation. The Text is <HI>Luke</HI> xiv. 33. where 'tis not at all to the purpo&s;e of the pre&s;ent Con|trover&s;y: The Conditions there mentioned are not the Conditions of our Salvation, but quite another thing: The De&s;ign of the Parable is to &s;hew that tho&s;e who have not Courage to fight with their &s;piritual Enemies, the World, the Fle&s;h, and the Devil, mu&s;t e'en make <HI>Conditions of Peace with them,</HI> that is, &s;it &s;till and neglect <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and Religion.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Word <HI>Condition,</HI> (though it be an innocent and an u&s;eful and expre&s;&s;ive Word in the matter of Duty and Privilege) yet it hath been ill explained by &s;ome Preachers, and wor&s;e under&s;tood by &s;ome Hearers, and thereby it hath given great Offence: I &s;ay this therefore only to &s;hew that there is not &s;o much Here&s;y and Poi&s;on in tho&s;e four Syllables as &s;ome learned Men

If any Man will fix &s;uch a rigid Sen&s;e on the word <HI>Condition</HI> as is incon&s;i&s;tent with the Grace of the Go&s;pel; and then &s;ay, the Go&s;pel has no Conditions in it, I will not contend with him; for he &s;peaks con&s;i&s;tently with him&s;elf, and with Scripture too; becau&s;e Scripture does not u&s;e the Word: But if <HI>Condition</HI> be taken in a very plain and common Sen&s;e for <HI>any one thing upon which another is &s;u&s;pended,</HI> I do not know any Scripture that forbids the u&s;e of it, but &s;uch Texts as the&s;e, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> x. 32. <HI>Give no Offence to &mdash; the Church of God.</HI> Rom. xv. 2. <HI>Plea&s;e your Neighbour for his Good to Edification.</HI></P>

<P>When 'tis u&s;ed in its proper and limited Sen&s;e it de|notes a mere Declaration of the good Will of God for the Recovery of fallen Man: So the Texts before cited <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 8. <HI>Heb.</HI> x. 16, 17. And &s;o 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> v. 19. where the Go&s;pel is called <HI>the Word of Reconciliation,</HI> the Sub|&s;tance of it is, that <HI>God was in</HI> Chri&s;t, <HI>reconciling the World to him&s;elf, not imputing their Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es to them.</HI> So the fir&s;t Go&s;pel that ever was preached to <HI>Adam,</HI> after the Fall, was a free Di&s;covery of Mercy, Gen. iii. 15. <HI>The Seed of the Woman &s;hall brui&s;e the Serpent's Head.</HI></P>
<P>When the Word <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> is u&s;ed in its larger Sen&s;e, it includes Predictions, Commands, Promi&s;es, Threat|nings, Hi&s;tories, Examples, and almo&s;t whatever is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to enforce tho&s;e Duties upon the Con&s;ciences

of Men, which are as Means appointed, in order to partake of the Privileges.</P>
<P>So the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> contains in it Narratives of Matters of Fact, or Hi&s;tories, Mark i. 1. <HI>The beginning of the Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> which &s;eems to refer to all the follow|ing Hi&s;tory of his Life and Death; and the four Hi&s;tories of the Evangeli&s;ts are called <HI>Go&s;pels,</HI> which Title (if not Divine originally, yet) has been the Language of the Church, through &s;o many Ages of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>The Word <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> contains, al&s;o, &s;ome <HI>Doctrines,</HI> Col. i. 5. <HI>The Hope which is laid up for you in Heaven, whereof ye heard before in the Word of Truth of the Go&s;pel.</HI> The Go&s;pel reveals Truths before unknown to Men. So <HI>Life and Immortality are brought to Light by the Go&s;pel,</HI> 2 Tim. i. 10. <HI>i. e.</HI> Doctrines of the heavenly State.</P>
<P><HI>Commands,</HI> 2 Cor. ix. 13. <HI>By the Experiment of this Mini&s;tration they glorify God for your profe&s;&s;ed Subjection to the Go&s;pel of</HI> Chri&s;t. This Subjection to the Go&s;pel, implies, that Liberality is commanded in it. <HI>Acts</HI> xvi. 21. <HI>Believe in the Lord</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t <HI>and thou &s;halt be &s;aved.</HI> This is the Command given to the convinced Jailor.</P>
<P><HI>Promi&s;es and Threatnings,</HI> Mark xvi. 16. <HI>Preach the Go&s;|pel to every Creature; he that believeth and is baptiz'd &s;hall be &s;aved, he that believeth not &s;hall be damned.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Predictions,</HI> particularly of the final Judgment. Rom. ii. 16. <HI>God &s;hall judge the Secrets of Men by</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>according to my Go&s;pel.</HI> That is, according as I have preached.</P>
<P>It is plain, that &s;ometimes the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> is &s;aid to be the Object of Belief, as Mark i. 15. <HI>Believe the Go&s;pel</HI>; and there it &s;ignifies a Declaration of Grace to Sinners. Sometimes it is &s;aid to be the Object of Obedience. Rom. x. 16. <HI>All have not obeyed the Go&s;pel:</HI> there it mu&s;t include Duties and Commands.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="006440_0049_1028EF88D65043D8">It is al&s;o evident, that in many Places of the New Te&s;tament, the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> is u&s;ed to &s;ignify the who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Mini&s;try of the Apo&s;tles, and all the Subjects of their preaching, as Rom. i. 9. <HI>Whom I &s;erve in the Go&s;pel.</HI> 1 Cor. ix. 14. <HI>They that preach the Go&s;pel &s;hould live of the Go&s;pel, (viz.</HI>) be maintained, not merely for preach|ing a Promi&s;e, but for the whole of their Mini&s;tration; and therefore the Apo&s;tle &s;ometimes calls it <HI>my Go&s;pel,</HI> and <HI>our Go&s;pel,</HI> to &s;ignify his whole Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>Nor do I think there is any great Difference, whe|ther we include Commands, Threatnings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the Word <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> taken in a large Sen&s;e, or call them Appen|dices and Attendants of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> taking the Word in a Sen&s;e more proper and limited: For the Language of Scripture &s;eems to favour the one as well as the other.</P>
<P>But this is the Mi&s;chief that ari&s;eth between Chri&s;|tians that differ in their Sentiments or Expre&s;&s;ion of Things, they imagine that while one is true, the other mu&s;t needs be fal&s;e; and then they brand each other with Error and Here&s;y; whereas if they would but at|tend to Scripture, that would &s;hew them to be both in the Right, by its different Explication of their own Forms of &s;peaking. The <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> hath, or hath not <HI>Com|mands</HI> and <HI>Conditions</HI> in it, according to the various Sen&s;es in which 'tis u&s;ed.</P>
<P>And in this way of Reconciliation I cannot but hope for &s;ome Succe&s;s, becau&s;e it falls in with the univer&s;al fond E&s;teem that each Man hath of his own Under|&s;tanding; it proves that two warm Di&s;puters may both have Truth on their Side: Now if ten Per&s;ons differ in their Sentiments, it is much ea&s;ier to per&s;uade all of them that they may be all in the Right, than it is to convince one that he is in the wrong.</P>

<LABEL>QUESTION.</LABEL> <HI>Whether the Go&s;pel be a New Law?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> A <HI>Law</HI> in the proper and full Meaning of the Word, includes the&s;e three Things in it.</P>
<P N="1">I. That there be &s;ome Command given out, wherein &s;ome Duty is required, or Sin forbidden by the ju&s;t Authority of a Superior.</P>
<P N="2">II. That there be a Sanction, or Penalty annexed to the Neglect of that Duty required, or the Commi&s;&s;ion of that Sin forbidden: This Sanction is not always ex|pre&s;s'd, but it is always imply'd; for the Authority that is &s;ufficient to impo&s;e a Command on any Per&s;on, mu&s;t al&s;o be &s;ufficient to puni&s;h the Breach of this Command, and the Offender is liable to bear it; otherwi&s;e the Command would be a mere Advice, and not a Law.</P>
<P N="3">III. That the Performance of this Duty or Duties required, and Ab&s;tinence from the&s;e Sins forbidden, is our proper Righteou&s;ne&s;s, or Matter upon which we are ju&s;tified in the Court of this Law.</P>
<P>The&s;e three Things are imply'd in every &s;trict and proper <HI>Law</HI>: And I might prove it by In&s;tances of the chief Laws that Scripture &s;peaks of (<HI>viz.</HI>) The Law of Innocency, the Law of Nature, and the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Law.</P>
<P>Thus it was in the <HI>Law of Innocency</HI> or Covenant of Works with <HI>Adam</HI>; the Duties required, were all that the Light of Nature and Rea&s;on enjoin'd to <HI>Adam</HI> in &s;uch Circum&s;tances, to which there was one po&s;itive Prohibition added, <HI>Thou &s;halt not eat of the Tree of Know|ledge,</HI> &amp;c. and the Sanction and Penalty is expre&s;s'd; <HI>In the Day thou eate&s;t thereof thou &s;halt &s;urely die,</HI> Gen. ii. 17. and <HI>Adam</HI>'s Ob&s;ervance of this Law would have been his Righteou&s;ne&s;s in the Sight of God, and ju&s;ti|fied him before God, according to the general Lan|guage
<PB N="36" REF="006440_0051_1028EF8EDF81E718">
of this, and all Laws. <HI>The Man that doth them &s;hall live in them,</HI> Gal. iii. 12. And 'tis generally agreed, that the Tree of Life was a Symbol or Seal of Im|mortal Life to <HI>Adam,</HI> if he obeyed the Law.</P>
<P>Thus it was al&s;o in the <HI>Law of Nature,</HI> or moral Law, which is very little different from the Law of Innocency, and this Law is plainly de&s;cribed by the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Rom.</HI> ii. 12, 13, 14, 15. <HI>The Work of the Law is written in the Hearts of the Heathens, i. e.</HI> The general Commands and Penalties may be found by the Light of Nature, and <HI>the Doers of this Law &s;hall be ju&s;tified.</HI> Not that St. <HI>Paul</HI> means, that any Per&s;on &s;hall actually be ju&s;tified by his Doing, but that this is the way of Ju&s;tification, according to the Law of Nature.</P>
<P>Thus it was, al&s;o, in the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Law or <HI>Sinai</HI> Cove|nant, which was not the Go&s;pel, but an additional Con|&s;titution, relating only to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation, to be govern'd by God as their peculiar King. And it was really di&s;tinct from the Covenant of Grace or Go&s;pel of Salvation, whereby <HI>Adam, Noah, Abraham,</HI> and the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> them&s;elves were to be &s;aved. Some Per&s;ons, indeed, call it a legal Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Covenant of Grace (with whom I will not contend) but it is more agreeable to the Language of Scripture, to call it a di&s;tinct Covenant, or a Covenant or Law of Works, as a <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Appendix to the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>It is true, indeed, the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Law had much of Grace in it as well as much of Terror, and in many Parts of it, it repre&s;ented, typify'd, witne&s;s'd and held forth the Go&s;pel or Covenant of Grace, whereby all Believers in all Ages are to be &s;aved, as well as the original Law of Nature, or the general Covenant of Works, whereby all Men are cur&s;ed and condemn'd; and the Apo&s;tle makes u&s;e of it in all the&s;e Views in his Epi&s;tles to the <HI>Romans, Galatians</HI> and <HI>Hebrews</HI>: But the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="006440_0052_1028EF9194C7A038">
Law in its own proper Nature and De&s;ign, was a &s;pecial or particular <HI>Covenant of Works</HI> with temporal Promi&s;es and temporal Threatnings.</P>
<P>The <HI>Duties</HI> enjoin'd were chiefly contained in the four la&s;t Books of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and commonly called the <HI>Moral,</HI> the <HI>Ceremonial,</HI> and the <HI>Judicial</HI> or <HI>Political</HI> Law: The <HI>Sanction</HI> is written in many Parts of tho&s;e Books; &s;ome of the Threatnings or Penalties were to be inflicted on particular Offenders by the Magi&s;trate, &s;uch as, beat|ing with Rods, &s;toning to Death, Fines and Amerce|ments of Money or Goods, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Some were to be in|flicted on the whole Nation by God him&s;elf, if they tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed this Law, &s;uch as Plagues, Famine, Bani&s;h|ment from the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Deut.</HI> xxviii. and the <HI>ju&s;tifying Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> according to this Law, was their Obedience to the Precepts and Ordinances of it. Deut. vi. 25. <HI>And it &s;hall be our Righteou&s;ne&s;s if we ob|&s;erve to do all the&s;e Commandments before the Lord our God, as he hath commanded us.</HI> So Deut. xxiv. 13. &s;o Rom. x. 5. Mo&s;es <HI>de&s;cribeth the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of the Law, That the Man which doth tho&s;e Things &s;hall live by them.</HI></P>
<P>Now let us con&s;ider how far the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> partakes of the Nature of a <HI>Law,</HI> and may be &s;o called.</P>
<P N="1">I. The <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> taken in a large Sen&s;e, hath &s;o much of the Nature of a <HI>Law</HI> in it, that there are Commands given, Duties enjoin'd, Sins forbidden; and it hath a Sanction al&s;o, for there are terrible Penalties annexed to the Contempt or Rejection of it, even a <HI>much &s;orer Puni&s;hment</HI> than was threaten'd for the Breach of the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> Heb. x. 28, 29. And becau&s;e it partakes &s;o much of the Nature of a Law, and hath &s;uch Re|&s;emblance to it, it is in a few Places of Scripture called a <HI>Law,</HI> without Di&s;pute. I&s;a. ii. 3. <HI>The Law &s;hall go forth from</HI> Zion. Rom. iii. 27. <HI>The Law of Faith.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="38" REF="006440_0053_1028EF9320CF2798">II. The <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> is not a <HI>Law</HI> in the full Sen&s;e of the Word, for it wants the third requi&s;ite of a <HI>Law.</HI> What|&s;oever Duties are required in the Go&s;pel, the Perfor|mance of tho&s;e Duties by us is not de&s;cribed in Scrip|ture as the Matter of our Righteou&s;ne&s;s before God. There are many Ble&s;&s;ings promi&s;ed, and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;&s;es pronounced in the Go&s;pel upon the Di&s;charge of various Duties of Holine&s;s, which are pre&s;cribed in the New Te&s;tament; but in the Court of God and his Word, a Sinner is not ju&s;tified by any, or all the&s;e Duties. Faith it&s;elf, which is the fir&s;t and great Requirement of the Go&s;pel, is not our ju&s;tifying Righteou&s;ne&s;s, but is the Way and Means to obtain, or be po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of a ju&s;tifying Righteou&s;ne&s;s. The Righteou&s;|ne&s;s by which we are ju&s;tified under the Go&s;pel doth not u&s;e to be repre&s;ented as a Righteou&s;ne&s;s wrought in us, or by us, or as a Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Works, or a Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Man; but it is menti|oned as a Righteou&s;ne&s;s from without us, a <HI>given Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Rom. v. 27. <HI>a Righteou&s;ne&s;s imputed without Works,</HI> Rom. iv. 6. And it is commonly called by St. <HI>Paul, the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God;</HI> it is a Rectitude in the Court of God including or inferring an Ab&s;olution from Guilt, and a Right to Heaven appointed, prepared and be&s;towed by God him&s;elf upon all them that believe; and it is received by our Faith or tru&s;ting in <HI>Chri&s;t. The Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God is by the Faith of</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t <HI>unto all and upon all them that believe,</HI> Rom. iii. 22. And it is called <HI>the Gift of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> in Rom. v. 17. as a very di&s;tinct Thing from the <HI>Gift</HI> of <HI>Faith.</HI> Eph. ii. 8.</P>
<P>And here we may do well to take Notice that tho' there are a great many Differences between the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> which St. <HI>Paul</HI> preached, and the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Law, &s;uch as the Multitude of arbitrary Commands in the natural and civil Life, the Burden of many Ceremonies, the Temporal Promi&s;es and Threatnings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet the grand

Point ot Difference, which he frequently in&s;i&s;ted on, is the different way of Ju&s;tification (<HI>viz.</HI>) That the one is by Works, the other not. (Always remembring that before God as the great Lord of Con&s;cience, and with Regard to eternal Life, the <HI>Jews</HI> were to be ju&s;tify'd and &s;av'd by the &s;ame Go&s;pel, and by Faith, even as <HI>Abraham</HI> of old, and <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> now. But with regard to God, con&s;idered as their Political Governor or King by the <HI>Sinai</HI> Covenant, they were to be ju&s;tified by Works.) The Ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle therefore treating accu|rately of the&s;e Matters ever di&s;tingui&s;hes the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> from the <HI>Law,</HI> whether it be the Law of Nature, the Law of Innocency, the <HI>Jewi&s;h Law,</HI> and indeed, from every thing that hath the full Nature and Form of a Law, by this particular Mark (<HI>viz.</HI>) that our Obedience to the Law would be our ju&s;tifying Righteou&s;ne&s;s if we perform'd it; but Obedience to the Go&s;pel is not our Ju&s;tifying Righteou&s;ne&s;s.

So Gal. iii. 11, 12, <HI>&amp;c.

<P>And therefore in&s;tead of repre&s;enting the &s;everal Duties injoin'd in the Go&s;pel, as the Matter of our Righteou&s;ne&s;s before God, the New Te&s;tament &s;ends us expre&s;ly to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> for Righteou&s;ne&s;s.

<P>This Account of things gives a plain Rea&s;on why the Go&s;pel ju&s;tifies and accepts tho&s;e Per&s;ons who perform an hone&s;t and &s;incere, but a very poor, incon|&s;tant and imperfect Obedience to the Commands con|tained in it, although tho&s;e Duties are there commanded in Perfection, (<HI>viz.</HI>) becau&s;e it is not our Obedience to tho&s;e Commands that is the ju&s;tifying Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Go&s;pel, but another Righteou&s;ne&s;s that is given us, <HI>i. e.</HI> a Freedom from Guilt, and a Right to Life, when we obey the fir&s;t great Command (<HI>viz.) Believing</HI> or <HI>tru&s;ting</HI> in <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Whereas a proper Law requires perfect Obedince for Ju&s;tification: The Language of every proper Law is this; <HI>Cur&s;ed</HI> or condemned <HI>is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the Book of the Law to do them,</HI> Gal. iii. 10. and <HI>Who&s;oever &s;hall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one Point, he is guilty of all.</HI> James ii. 10. That can be no ju&s;tifying Righteou&s;ne&s;s accord|ing to a Law which doth not ari&s;e to the Perfection of the Command, both for Kind, for Degree, for Conti|nuance, and for every Circum&s;tance. But the Go&s;pel propo&s;ing another ju&s;tifying Righteou&s;ne&s;s to be re|ceived only by our Faith, whether this Faith be &s;trong and perfect or no, yet (if it be true) it receives the Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the Believer is ju&s;tified. If a Cri|minal lay hold on a Pardon with a trembling paralytick Hand, he is as &s;afe from Condemnation, as he that with Courage and Strength reaches out his Arm to &s;eize
<PB N="43" REF="006440_0058_1028EF9F6E546D88">
it; becau&s;e it is not his Hand, but the Pardon &s;ecures him. If an <HI>I&s;raelite</HI> &s;tung by a fiery Serpent, could but ju&s;t look with half an Eye to the brazen Serpent, he was healed, as well as another that beheld it with &s;trong and &s;teddy Eyes. If the Man&s;layer was never &s;o lame and feeble, yet if he could but reach the City of Refuge, he was as &s;ecure from the Avenger, as he that fled to it with the &s;wifte&s;t Feet. So he that com|mits his guilty &s;inful Soul to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> for Salvation, though with a feeble Faith, and far &s;hort of Perfection, yet a Righteou&s;ne&s;s is given him; the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God is unto and upon all that believe, for there is no difference</HI>; and a weak Believer is as &s;ecure from Hell as a &s;tronger, though he cannot have &s;o much pre&s;ent Evidence or Comfort: And the Rea&s;on of his Safety is becau&s;e his believing is not his ju&s;tifying Righteou&s;ne&s;s, but is only a means to attain it.</P>
<P>This is my pre&s;ent be&s;t Sett of Thoughts upon this Subject; and though I have copied them all from the Word of God, &s;o far as I have been able to under&s;tand the Meaning of it, yet &s;ome &s;ubtile Di&s;puter may ari&s;e and tell me, he could embarra&s;s my Scheme with &s;o many Objections, and pre&s;s it with &s;uch powerful Dif|ficulties as are far above my Skill to &s;olve, and &s;o con|&s;train me to renounce it.</P>
<P>If this Di&s;puter can &s;hew me that any part of it is contrary to Scripture, I renounce it freely; but though he might perplex it with Difficulties which I could not ea&s;ily an&s;wer, yet I would not merely for that Rea&s;on be bound immediately to renounce it: For there are many Texts of Scripture it&s;elf which are &s;o embar|ra&s;&s;ed and perplexed by the cavelling Wit of the <HI>Dei&s;ts,</HI> or <HI>Socinians,</HI> that it may be exceeding hard to give a fair and &s;atisfactory Account of them; yet none of us, who are <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> dare to renounce the Scripture, nor tho&s;e very Texts that have &s;o much Darkne&s;s about them;

<P><HI>Object.</HI> I. Some may oppo&s;e me by Scripture, and &s;ay, Among all the Texts that call the Go&s;pel <HI>a Law,</HI> there is one that makes our Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s evidently to depend on our doing the Work commanded therein. <HI>James</HI> i. 25. <HI>Who&s;o looketh into the perfect Law of Liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful Hearer, but a Doer of the Work, this Man &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed in his Deed.</HI> Now this looks like Ju&s;tification by Obedience to the Commands of the Go&s;pel, which is the proper Nature of a Law.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I. That the Go&s;pel which hath Advices, Com|mands and Threatnings belonging to it &s;hould be &s;ome|times called a Law in Scripture is no Wonder, for the
<PB N="45" REF="006440_0060_1028EFA660F98358">
Word <HI>Law</HI> among the <HI>Jews,</HI> was in &s;o frequent U&s;e upon all Occa&s;ions, that not only Doctrines, Rules and Con&s;titutions were called <HI>Laws,</HI> but even the natural and &s;upernatural Principles of human Actions. So <HI>the Law of Kindne&s;s,</HI> Prov. xxxi. 26. for good Humour, or a Principle of Love and Civility. So <HI>the Law of Sin,</HI> Rom. vii. 25. for the Principles of corrupt Nature and evil Inclinations. So <HI>the Law of the Spirit of Life,</HI> for a Principle of Holine&s;s, <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 2. And yet if all the Places where &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e the Go&s;pel to be called <HI>a Law,</HI> were well examined, we &s;hould find them reduced to a very few in reality: Whence it will appear that this is not the common Language of Scripture. The Text cited in the <HI>Objection</HI> &s;eems rather to refer to the moral Law, which is called a <HI>Law of Liberty,</HI> becau&s;e it is freed from its cur&s;ing and condemning Power by the Go&s;pel, and made ea&s;y to Believers by their new Nature: Now, &s;urely, no Chri&s;tian will &s;ay that we are to be ju&s;tified by doing the Works of the moral Law.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> II. In tho&s;e Places of the New Te&s;tament where the Go&s;pel is, or is &s;uppo&s;ed to be called a <HI>Law,</HI> there is generally &s;ome qualifying Word added, as, <HI>the Law of Faith, the Law of Liberty,</HI> &amp;c. that it may &s;eem to &s;tand in Oppo&s;ition to a <HI>Law of Works,</HI> and appear di&s;tinct from a &s;trict and proper <HI>Law.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> III. There may be (as I have before hinted) many Ble&s;&s;ings promi&s;ed, and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;&s;es pronounced upon Obedience to any of the Commands of God, whether in the moral Law or Go&s;pel; &s;o <HI>P&s;alm</HI> i. 1. and cxix. 1, 2. &s;o <HI>Matth.</HI> v. 3 &mdash; 11.

<P><HI>Object.</HI> II. Another may draw an Argument from Rea&s;on, and &s;ay, What&s;oever Duties of Righteou&s;ne&s;s are required in any Con&s;titution or Covenant, the fulfill|ing tho&s;e Duties mu&s;t in the very Nature and Rea&s;on of Things be e&s;teemed that <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> upon which that Con&s;titution pronounces a Man ju&s;t or right in Court; &s;o Faith ju&s;tifies us again&s;t the Charge of Un|belief, &s;o Repentance and &s;incere Obedience ju&s;tify us again&s;t the Charge of Impenitency and Hypocri&s;y, and &s;o Per&s;everance ju&s;tifies us again&s;t the Charge of Apo&s;tacy, becau&s;e 'tis a Conformity to that Rule of Con&s;titution which requires Faith, Repentance, Per&s;e|verance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> It mu&s;t be granted indeed, that in the very Nature of Things our Faith ju&s;tifies us again&s;t the Charge of Unbelief, &s;o far as our Faith goes; and our Repen|tance and our Love to God ju&s;tify us again&s;t the Charge of Impenitence, and hating God &s;o far as we do repent and love him; and our Meekne&s;s and Humility and Sincerity, ju&s;tify us again&s;t the Charge of Pride and Pa&s;|&s;ion, and Hypocri&s;y, &s;o far as we are meek, humble and &s;incere: And in this Sen&s;e the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> might &s;ay, John iii. 7. <HI>He that doth Righteou&s;ne&s;s is righteous, as God is righteous,</HI> (where <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> is evidently u&s;ed for <HI>Holine&s;s,</HI> and not in a foren&s;ick Sen&s;e, to &s;ignify <HI>Ju&s;ti|fication.</HI>) But all our Virtues and Graces of Faith, Love, Repentance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are &s;o very far from Perfec|tion, and &s;o much below what the Holine&s;s of God and his Commands require, that the Spirit of God in his Word, hath not thought fit to honour the&s;e our Works with the Name of <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> when he is de&s;cribing the Way how a Sinner is ju&s;tified; nor hath he ap|plied

<P N="2">2.

<P>'Tis on this Matter that our Divines are wont to make a Di&s;tinction between the <HI>Jus haereditarium,</HI> or the <HI>Right of Heir&s;hip</HI> which a Son has to his Father's E&s;tate as &s;oon as he is born, (&s;uppo&s;ing his Father to be dead) and the <HI>Jus aptitudinarium,</HI> which is a <HI>Right of Fitne&s;s,</HI> and a Right to the immediate Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and this he has not till the Age of Manhood.

The Scriptures that naturally lead to this Di&s;|tinction are the&s;e: The Right of <HI>Heir&s;hip</HI> by Faith is very plain, <HI>Rom.</HI> iv. 11, 13, 16. <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 26, 29. <HI>For ye are all the Children of God by Faith in</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us. <HI>And if ye be</HI> Chri&s;t<HI>'s, then are ye</HI> Abraham<HI>'s Seed, and Heirs ac|cording to the Promi&s;e.</HI> (Nor doth the Apo&s;tle make much Di&s;tinction between our Right to Heaven by Ju&s;|tification, and that by Adoption or Inheritance, for both Ju&s;tification and Adoption come by Faith; and he in|termingles both, as they mo&s;t fitly an&s;wer his pre&s;ent De&s;ign; which is evident by comparing the Proce&s;s of his Di&s;cour&s;e from <HI>Rom.</HI> iv. 1 &mdash; 16. and <HI>Rom.</HI> v. 17, 18, 21.)

that after ye have done the Will of God, ye might receive the Promi&s;e</HI>; and this is the Right intended, <HI>Rev.</HI> xxii. 14.

<P>Thus have I thrown into &s;ome Order tho&s;e few, plain, reconciling Thoughts between the contending Parties of Chri&s;tians, and am already almo&s;t in Pain to think that I &s;hall a little di&s;plea&s;e all Parties, becau&s;e all the&s;e Thoughts will hardly &s;quare and adju&s;t them|&s;elves exactly to any of the popular and &s;ettled <HI>Schemes of Orthodoxy</HI>; or at lea&s;t, they will never agree with the Extremes on either hand: Yet if they appear to be drawn merely from the Scripture, and to &s;peak the Language of the Holy Writers, then this Di&s;cour&s;e will approve it&s;elf to tho&s;e who maintain the mo&s;t &s;acred Regard to the Bible; and tho&s;e Schemes &s;hould be a little moulded and bent, to adju&s;t them to the Language of Scripture, even when it u&s;es different Forms of Speech. But I &s;hall not enter farther into this Contro|ver&s;y, becau&s;e my De&s;ign is to &s;often the angry Tem|pers of Men, that they may not rage again&s;t each other when they u&s;e different Forms of &s;peaking, as the Scrip|ture it&s;elf does, and make an Apology for both Sides, while they agree in the Things that are mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial and nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Let me repre&s;ent the <HI>various Apprehen&s;ions</HI> of Men in tho&s;e Matters: But here I would be under&s;tood to de&s;cribe only the moderate Men among tho&s;e who are called <HI>Calvini&s;ts,</HI> and tho&s;e that are named <HI>New-Methodi&s;ts</HI>; as for the High-Flyers, or extreme and rigid Party-Men of either Side, I leave them out in my pre&s;ent Account, while I mention the little Differences among the Men of Moderation, among whom I reckon far the greate&s;t part of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> to be at this time, and I hope I am not mi&s;|taken in this Opinion.</P>
<P>Some when they read or pronounce the Words <HI>Law</HI> or <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> take them generally in their loo&s;e&s;t and large&s;t Sen&s;e, and &s;o they unite their Names, and make them con&s;i&s;tent together; others are ready to take tho&s;e Words in their limited and proper Sen&s;e, and then they divide them into very di&s;tinct Things, and will not allow their Names &s;o promi&s;cuous a U&s;e.</P>
<P>Some Mini&s;ters love to explain the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> in a more <HI>legal</HI> way, and de&s;cribe it as a <HI>conditional Covenant</HI> that requires Agreements and Re&s;tipulation from Men; they in&s;i&s;t much on vowing and re&s;olving to &s;ubmit to the Commands of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and with a lively Zeal and powerful Eloquence, they inforce the Duties of Re|pentance, &s;incere Obedience, Watchfulne&s;s and Per|&s;everance; and &s;hew how much the Promi&s;es of Life, Heaven and Glory, Peace and daily Pardon de|pend on the&s;e Qualifications and Performances, pro|nouncing the terrible Threatnings of Damnation on the Impenitent, the Unbelieving, and the Di&s;obedient, to

awaken the &s;ecure Sinner, and &s;tir up the &s;lothful Chri&s;tian. Others delight more in repre&s;enting the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> as a <HI>Declaration of Grace and free Promi&s;e</HI> of Sal|vation to Sinners; a Promi&s;e of pardoning Mercy, Sanctifying Grace, and everla&s;ting Glory to &s;inful and peri&s;hing Criminals, and invite Sinners to receive all this Grace, to accept of this Salvation, and to tru&s;t in this Saviour, according to the Offers of the Go&s;pel: When its Truths are revealed, the fir&s;t Sort chu&s;e to &s;ay, that the Moral Law of Nature in the Hand of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> commands us to believe them; when its Duties are men|tion'd, they rather &s;ay, the Law of Nature in the Hand of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> requires Obedience to them; and that while the Go&s;pel in its proper Language promi&s;es Salvation to Believers, the Moral Law, or Law of Nature, binds Condemnation on the Unbeliever, and the Impenitent; but the pure Go&s;pel is all Grace and Mercy: And they preach the Law of Works in the Perfection of its Demands and Terror of its Penalties, to drive Sinners for Refuge to the Go&s;pel: And they pre&s;s the Duties of Holine&s;s on their Hearers from a comfortable Sen&s;e of their Deliverance from Hell, and from Gra|titude to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as Evidences of their Faith, as Prepa|ratives for Heaven, and as nece&s;&s;ary, both in the Na|ture of Things, and by divine Appointment in order to our final Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that follow the <HI>conditional</HI> Way of preaching the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> de&s;cribe the chief Act of <HI>Faith,</HI> as a <HI>Con&s;ent of Will</HI> to &s;ubmit them&s;elves to him in all his Offices; a Con&s;ent to take him for their <HI>Prophet,</HI> and Re&s;olution to make all his In&s;tructions their Rule and Guide; a Con&s;ent to take him for their <HI>Prie&s;t,</HI> to make their Peace with God, and obtain their Pardon; a Con&s;ent to own him for their <HI>King,</HI> and promi&s;e &s;incere Obe|dience to him as their Lord in all his Commands;

but &s;till with an humble Dependance on his Spirit and Grace, to enable them to fulfil the&s;e Re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that preach the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> in its more free and <HI>ab&s;olute Form</HI> de&s;cribe <HI>Faith</HI> in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as the Flight of a poor, guilty, peri&s;hing Sinner to an only Refuge; and they make its chief Act to con&s;i&s;t in a tru&s;ting or com|mitting the Soul, ignorant, guilty, hard-hearted and &s;inful as it is, into the Hand of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> with a &s;incere De&s;ire to have it enlightened by him as their Prophet, pardon'd and reconciled to God through him as their Prie&s;t, and &s;ubdued to all willing Obedience to him, and by him, as their Lord and King; humbly expecting that he will do all this for them; and this is in their Opinion the be&s;t way of addre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to poor Sinners, who find them&s;elves &s;o dark, &s;o &s;inful, &s;o feeble and incon&s;tant in their be&s;t Obedience and Purpo&s;es, that they dare not re&s;olve upon any thing, and can hardly &s;ay, they heartily vow and promi&s;e a Submi&s;&s;ion to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in all Things; but that they can better apply to him in a way of Tru&s;t and Dependance, humbly de&s;iring and hoping he will work all this in them by his free Grace, while they wait upon him in his appointed Means.</P>
<P>The one are ever per&s;uading their Hearers to bind their Souls to God, by &s;olemn Vows and Covenants, even in particular Duties, believing this to be the mo&s;t effectual Way to guard again&s;t every Sin, and be&s;t &s;ecure their Obedience and Con&s;tancy under every Temptation: The other are afraid to urge &s;o much vowing and re&s;olving on the Con&s;ciences of Men, le&s;t they thereby lead them into a legal Frame, under a Spirit of Bondage, and le&s;t their Con&s;ciences be more trouble&s;omely entangled and en&s;nared after every broken Vow, and their Faith and Hope be too much di&s;couraged; that Faith and Hope which ought to be the con&s;tant Springs of their Obedi|ence.

Though it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that with regard to Chri&s;tians of different Tempers and Temp|tations, both the&s;e Methods have had very good Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>Some are Sons of Thunder, <HI>Boanerges,</HI> and frighten the Profane out of their Security, by many Terrors that are written again&s;t tho&s;e who obey not the Go&s;pel; and they inforce Obedience on the Con&s;ciences of Believers, chiefly by way of Rewards and Puni&s;hments: The other are like <HI>Barnabas</HI>'s, Sons of Con&s;olation, and per&s;wade Sinners to accept of the offer'd Grace, by all the Allurements of the Compa&s;&s;ion of God, and by the dying Love of a Redeemer, be&s;eeching them to be reconciled: And they draw out the Hearts of Belie|vers to Repentance, and lead them with the Spirit of Power and Love to an ea&s;y and connatural Obedience by the Con&s;traints of the Love of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and by a humble Per&s;wa&s;ion of their Acceptance in him unto eternal Life.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the one dwell mo&s;t upon the Duties of the Go&s;pel in their Sermons, in order to qualify their Hearers for the Privileges; the other in&s;i&s;t mo&s;t on the Privileges and Comforts of the Go&s;pel, in order to invite and allure them to fulfil the Duties, and to give their Hearers Strength and Delight in the Di&s;charge of the&s;e Duties.</P>
<P>I would not here be under&s;tood, as though I &s;up|po&s;ed either of tho&s;e Mini&s;ters never to mingle Mercy and Terror, Precepts, Penalties, and Promi&s;es; for it mu&s;t be acknowledged, there are &s;ome Per&s;ons of each Opinion, in whom all the Talents of a Preacher hap|pily unite, and they honourably &s;u&s;tain both Charac|ters,

<P>All our <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Confe&s;&s;ions of Faith, and I would per&s;wade my&s;elf that our Mini&s;ters, at lea&s;t among the <HI>Nonconformi&s;ts,</HI> agree that, though Duties are required to be performed by us, yet the Grace that is nece&s;&s;ary to perform them is given freely to us; that though Faith and Repentance, and &s;incere Obedience, are in|di&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, in order to our final Salvation, yet they are not the ju&s;tifying Righteou&s;ne&s;s upon ac|count of which our Sins are pardoned, and eternal Life is be&s;towed upon us: That the Obedience and Death, and Interce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as a proper High-Prie&s;t and Sacrifice, are the only Foundation of our Acceptance with God, and ground of all our Hopes; and that from him, as a Head of Influence, we mu&s;t receive all Grace, whereby we are conducted &s;afe to Glory.</P>
<P>Both Sides agree that we are to <HI>work out our Salvation with Fear and Trembling,</HI> but that it <HI>is God who worketh in us to will and to do,</HI> Phil. ii. 12, 13.

up in Prejudices to &s;ome Party or other, incompa&s;&s;ed with thou&s;and things that tend to influence the Judg|ment, and incline it in&s;en&s;ibly toward &s;ome particular Opinion; &s;o that a whole Scheme of Doctrines built upon a pure and zealous and laborious Search after Truth, without any manner of Bya&s;s or Corruption on any Side, is &s;carce to be found in human Nature. There is no Man alive free from the&s;e Weakne&s;&s;es. Happy the Mind that has the fewe&s;t of them.</P>

<P>It may be the&s;e Mini&s;ters them&s;elves, who differ in Opinion, are of very different natural Complexions and Tempers, and this hath a &s;ecret Influence in &s;waying their Mind, their Studies, their Judgment and Mini&s;try one way or the other; though all tho&s;e who agree in natural Temper, are not always of the &s;ame Opinion.</P>
<P>Or it may be, they had an Education under Teachers and Tutors of different Sentiments, or have met with Books of different Principles and Opinions, which have made a &s;trong and la&s;ting Impre&s;&s;ion upon their Minds, and engag'd them betimes into one Party, before they had Strength of Judgment to determine their Opinions upon ju&s;t Arguments.</P>
<P>Some Per&s;ons in order to &s;ettle their Judgments in the&s;e Points, have &s;tudied more and prayed le&s;s, and &s;ome have prayed more and &s;tudied too little; and &s;ome on both Sides have &s;tudied hard, and pray'd much, and &s;ought earne&s;tly the In&s;tructions of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, and yet have fallen into different ways of thinking in tho&s;e parts of Chri&s;tianity which are not of Nece&s;&s;ity to Salvation, and have been &s;uffer'd to follow different Forms of Speech for wi&s;e Purpo&s;es in the Providence of God.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="006440_0074_1028EFCDBAA53AB8">Some little Accident or Occurrence of Life, or &s;ome &s;udden &s;tart of Thought, while the Balance of the Judg|ment was in Su&s;pence, has perhaps given it a turn to one Side or the other, and perhaps determined it for their whole Lives.</P>
<P>Some have happened to form their Sett of Doctrines at fir&s;t more by their own rea&s;oning Powers, and drawn their Schemes of Religion from what they imagine the mo&s;t natural Connection, the Nece&s;&s;ity or Congruity of things, and they call the Bible only to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and &s;eek proper Texts to confirm their own Sy&s;tem: Others draw the whole Scheme of Doctrines from a con&s;tant and intent Application to the holy Scripture, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ll in Rea&s;on to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, only in order to under&s;tand and methodize tho&s;e Doctrines: And though the fir&s;t way of Study in Matters of the <HI>Chri&s;|tian</HI> Religion, is by no means to be ju&s;tified, yet too many have unhappily practi&s;ed it; and though the latter way is much to be preferred, and mo&s;t likely to come near the Truth, yet it is not followed by all who preach the Go&s;pel; and no wonder then that Mini&s;ters may differ in their Thoughts.</P>
<P>Such is the Weakne&s;s of human Nature, that as &s;ome of us form and build up our fir&s;t Opinions upon very &s;light and in&s;ufficient grounds, and there are many who per&s;i&s;t in them, and &s;trongly maintain them with|out an hone&s;t Re-examination, &s;o others of us change our Opinions upon Rea&s;ons as &s;light and feeble and in&s;ufficient. Some Per&s;ons having been perplexed with one or two great Difficulties in that Scheme of Senti|ments which they have profe&s;&s;ed, and being unable to grapple with them, have by &s;wift or &s;low Degrees, abandoned that whole Scheme, and fell in with another, which perhaps hath equal or greater Difficulties in it; never con&s;idering that the whole Sy&s;tem of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> with all its Appendices, is &s;o va&s;t, and our View of
<PB N="60" REF="006440_0075_1028EFD1FAB2B3F0">
things is &s;o narrow, and our Knowledge &s;o imperfect, that a &s;harp Di&s;putant may pu&s;h &s;ome parts of all our human Schemes into great Perplexities, even &s;uch as human Rea&s;on can hardly &s;olve; and perhaps God alone knows how to reconcile them, in who&s;e &s;ingle View all things lie for ever fair and open, perfectly con&s;i&s;tent, and are comprehended at once.</P>
<P>Or it may be the <HI>Way</HI> and <HI>Method</HI> of <HI>Divine Grace</HI> in <HI>the fir&s;t Conver&s;ion</HI> of the one and the other was very different. Some were wrought upon at fir&s;t more by legal Methods, and the Terrors of the Law of God, and they find them &s;till to have the greate&s;t and mo&s;t powerful Influence on their Con&s;ciences; others from their wild Wandrings were brought home to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> by gentle Di&s;coveries of Divine Love in the Death of a Saviour: Some, like the Jaylor, <HI>Acts</HI> xvi. 26, &mdash; 30. have had their Con&s;ciences &s;haken as with an Earth|quake, they <HI>came in trembling and crying out, What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI> Others had their Hearts <HI>&s;oftly open'd,</HI> as was the Heart of <HI>Lydia,</HI> 14th <HI>ver.</HI> of the &s;ame Chapter, and they received the Word of Grace and the Go&s;pel; and they find the Work of God carried on upon their own Souls, &s;till by the mo&s;t evangelical Methods. Now a Man's own early Experiences in the things of Religion, will naturally have a great In|fluence on his Opinions; and God in his infinite Wi&s;|dom hath ordered it &s;hould be &s;o, that Per&s;ons of every Sort and Temper, and Humour, Young and Old, Sinners and Saints, under every kind of Temptation, might meet with &s;ome Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, and &s;ome Sermons and Writings to &s;uit their Ta&s;te, to hit their Ca&s;e, and be the mo&s;t effectual Means of their Sal|vation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Third thing</HI> I propo&s;ed here was to &s;hew briefly, that as <HI>each of the&s;e ways of preaching have their &s;everal Advantages,</HI> &s;o each of them have their <HI>&s;pecial Incon|veniences</HI>
<PB N="61" REF="006440_0076_1028EFD473BFCD80">
too, if they are perpetually and only in&s;i&s;ted on, unle&s;s well managed by the extraordinary Prudence of the Preacher.</P>
<P><HI>The one</HI> aims mo&s;t at the <HI>Glory of Divine Equity,</HI> in Rewards and Puni&s;hments, and contends much for the <HI>Sincerity of God</HI> in all his Tran&s;actions with Men: The other &s;eems to look mo&s;t at honouring <HI>the Sovereignty, the Riches and Freedom of Divine Grace,</HI> and God's infi|nite Conde&s;cention and Compa&s;&s;ion to &s;inful Creatures.</P>
<P><HI>One</HI> &s;eems to lead <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> more to a &s;trict Scrupu|lo&s;ity in every Action, in order to make up the un|doubted Evidences of a Go&s;pel-Perfection, which they call <HI>Sincerity,</HI> and thereby to rai&s;e their Hopes of e&s;cap|ing Hell and obtaining Heaven; it drives the Soul to Duties, and maintains a trembling Watchfulne&s;s; but is in Danger of governing it by a Spirit of Bondage, and of keeping our Faith and Comfort very low. The other leads to equal Holine&s;s, or perhaps to higher Degrees of it by the delightful Con&s;traints of a filial Love, by the &s;weet Influences of Divine Con&s;olation; but there may be &s;ome Danger of incouraging Negli|gence and Pre&s;umption, and that not only in Sinners, but even &s;ometimes in Believers them&s;elves, if not wi&s;ely managed and guarded.</P>
<P>Upon this Subject I might here give my Pen into the Hand of &s;ome &s;prightly Advocate of each Party, and have forty more Pages written for me &s;peedily, without any Thought or Labour of mine; this would &s;well my <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> up finely, and enlarge it to a Volume, with many a Name of <HI>Arminian</HI> and <HI>Antinomian</HI> dealt about freely on the oppo&s;ite Opinions: For the &s;uppo&s;ed Advan|tages and Di&s;advantages on both Sides, are frequently mentioned as Arguments of each Party again&s;t the other; but I &s;hall not think nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;i&s;t longer on them here for that very Rea&s;on: And though the&s;e &s;ort of moral Arguments drawn from the De&s;ign and
<PB N="62" REF="006440_0077_1028EFD60439AA40">
Tendency of things, may be ju&s;tly u&s;ed on both Sides, and on both Sides have &s;ome Degree of Truth and Force in them, yet both may not have equal Force: Nor do I think it incon&s;i&s;tent with my De&s;ign in this reconciling Di&s;cour&s;e, to declare my own Sen|timents: <Q>For a Man may be very happy in making Peace between two quarrelling Neighbours, though he is well per&s;waded that one hath the better Side of the Cau&s;e, and in a friendly manner expre&s;&s;eth it too.</Q></P>
<P>I will not be a&s;hamed then to declare, that in my Opinion, one Method of preaching the Go&s;pel hath greater Advantages in it, and fewer Inconveniences than the other; &s;uppo&s;ing &s;till that we guard a|gain&s;t Extremes: that one &s;eems more connatural to the Genius of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> as it is di&s;tinct from a <HI>Cove|nant of Works,</HI> and &s;eems to &s;uit better with the mo&s;t glorious De&s;igns of Divine Grace. My own Experi|ence in the Things of Religion, my Ob&s;ervations of &s;ome others, and my diligent Search of the holy Scrip|tures (I hope not without Divine Aid) hath led my Thoughts rather to favour and practice the more Evan|gelical Method of preaching mo&s;t frequently: But another Per&s;on who follows a different way may tell me, he came by his Turn of Thoughts the &s;ame way as I did by mine, and my Charity demands that I believe it. Yet while both Sides maintain tho&s;e great Truths, wherein I mentioned the general Agreement of our <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Confe&s;&s;ions of Faith, I cannot con|ceive that either of them can lead Sinners a&s;tray from Salvation.</P>
<P>And that is the <HI>Fourth Propo&s;al</HI> I made, (<HI>viz.</HI>) to &s;hew the real <HI>Safety</HI> of each of the&s;e Methods in mini&s;tring the Go&s;pel both to Saints and Sinners, and that is evi|dent, becau&s;e they agree in the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and e&s;&s;ential Parts of it. Both of them preach Grace and

Duty, Ju&s;tification by <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and Sanctification by the Holy Spirit, and teach Men all that is of Nece&s;&s;ity to be believed and practi&s;ed in order to Salvation.</P>
<P>If two Men &s;itting under a different Mini&s;try are brought &s;incerely to repent of all Sin, and to love God with all their Heart, can I imagine that one &s;hall be damned, becau&s;e he tells me he repents in Obedience to the Commands of the Go&s;pel?

If two Sinners are per&s;uaded to accept of <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI> for their Lord and Saviour, can I ever believe, that God will condemn one of them, becau&s;e he fir&s;t re&s;olved to obey <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as his Lord, and thereby took Encouragement to tru&s;t in him as a Saviour? or that God will puni&s;h the other for ever, becau&s;e he fir&s;t tru&s;ted in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as a Saviour, and thereby found his Will &s;weetly inclined to &s;ubmit to him as his Lord?

<P>If either of the&s;e Ways of preaching the Go&s;pel were &s;o contrary to Scripture, and &s;uch abominable and pernicious Errors in the Sight of God as angry and quarreling Men of both Sides repre&s;ent them, I cannot per&s;uade my&s;elf that God would &s;o far have favoured both, in the&s;e In&s;tances following. (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<P N="1">I. If either of the&s;e Ways of preaching were &s;o cri|minal and dangerous as &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed, I cannot think the Spirit of God would have u&s;ed tho&s;e Expre&s;|&s;ions in Scripture, which &s;ometimes &s;eem to repre&s;ent
<PB N="64" REF="006440_0079_1028EFDC782CE7B8">
the Covenant of Grace in one Form, and &s;ometimes in another; nor that he would have &s;uffered the Pen|men of his holy Word to have given Occa&s;ion to &s;uch different Sentiments on this Subject among his Favourites, his holy Wor&s;hippers, and tho&s;e who have &s;ought his Directions and his Grace with much Im|portunity and Per&s;everance.</P>
<P N="2">II. If either of the&s;e Ways of preaching were &s;o dangerous as &s;ome have imagined, I cannot believe that the ble&s;&s;ed God would ever have attended both the&s;e Ways of preaching with his Ble&s;&s;ing, &s;o far as to convert great Numbers of Sinners by them, and edify his Saints; but it is &s;ufficiently evident that Mini&s;ters of very different Apprehen&s;ions in the&s;e Points have been owned and ble&s;&s;ed of God to the Conver&s;ion, Comfort and Salvation of many Souls.</P>
<P N="3">III. If either of the&s;e Repre&s;entations of the Go&s;|pel were &s;o very dangerous, I cannot imagine, that Per&s;ons of good Under&s;tanding, of deep Learning, of large Knowledge in Religion, of long Expe|rience, and of great Holine&s;s, &s;hould maintain their Opinions in the&s;e Things &s;o very different to their Lives End, if their Salvation were in &s;uch extreme Hazard thereby, however in the Infancy of their <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> they might have received and embra|ced the&s;e different Apprehen&s;ions. Surely if the&s;e Points had been of &s;o dreadful and dangerous Impor|tance on either Side, God would have granted a great|er Union in Sentiment to &s;o great a Number of his Children, who laboured in &s;incere Inquiry after Truth, con&s;tant and fervent Prayer for the Teaching of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, and were truly zealous for his Honour. Divine Goodne&s;s &s;urely would not have &s;uffered &s;uch Multitudes of holy Souls on either Side to continue al|ways in Mi&s;takes of &s;o terrible Con&s;equence as &s;ome Di&s;puters have repre&s;ented them.</P>

<P>May I be permitted at the End of this Di&s;cour&s;e to drop a Word or two of general <HI>Advice,</HI> or rather of humble Reque&s;t to all, but e&s;pecially to my younger Brethren in the Mini&s;try.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Reque&s;t. Pay a con&s;tant and &s;acred Reverence to the Language of Scripture,</HI> and let it appear in the&s;e follow|ing In&s;tances.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t.</HI> Let the Forms of Speech that are u&s;ed in tho&s;e Scriptures where the Doctrines of the Go&s;pel are ex|pre&s;ly laid down and proved, be the Speech in which you commonly teach tho&s;e Doctrines; and let the Lan|guage wherein warm and pathetical Exhortations are gi|ven in Scripture, be the Language which you generally imitate in your affectionate Addre&s;&s;es to the Con&s;ciences of Saints and Sinners; the one as well as the other are gi|ven for our Example. Whereas if we &s;hould preach and explain the deepe&s;t Truths in all the affectionate Forms and Flouri&s;hes of Speech and Metaphor, 'tis the Way to lead the Judgments of Hearers a&s;tray; but while we &s;ubmit our&s;elves to the Words which the Holy Spirit u&s;eth as our Pattern, both in teaching, and al&s;o in exhorting, we may humbly expect his inward Teach|ings to enlighten our own Under&s;tandings, and make our Labours in the Go&s;pel powerful to the Salvation of them that hear us.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> Let tho&s;e Words which are not u&s;ed in Scrip|ture never be zealou&s;ly maintained and in&s;i&s;ted on as nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation, and e&s;pecially where they give great Offence: Nor let tho&s;e Terms and Ways of Expre&s;&s;ion which Scripture u&s;eth but very &s;eldom, and upon particular Occa&s;ions, be the perpetual or con|&s;tant Language of your Mini&s;try, in Oppo&s;ition to
<PB N="66" REF="006440_0081_1028EFE0787A7F00">
tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions and Ways of Repre&s;entation which Scripture mo&s;t frequently delights to u&s;e; and let no authentic Sy&s;tems of Divinity, to which you are mo&s;t inclined, nor the Names of great Men ever prevail with you to break this Rule.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> Dare not indulge your&s;elf in a Di&s;gu&s;t to any Scripture Language, or an Aver&s;ion to tho&s;e Scriptures which &s;eem to run in a Stile and Expre&s;&s;ion different from the Language which you generally chu&s;e; for even tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions were de&s;igned for u&s;eful Pur|po&s;es by the Holy Spirit, and doubtle&s;s have attained &s;ome happy End in the Providence of God, in parti|cular Ca&s;es and Per&s;ons: If you &s;hould once encourage &s;uch a vicious Humour, it might proceed &s;o far at la&s;t, as to render a great Part of the Bible the Object of your Di&s;gu&s;t. Be &s;ure therefore always to maintain upon your Spirit &s;uch a reverential Tenderne&s;s for the Holy Scripture, that you may never dare to rail again&s;t any Expre&s;&s;ions that Scripture u&s;eth, nor oppo&s;e them with Violence, without a mode&s;t Di&s;tinction in what Sen&s;e they are proper, and in what Sen&s;e they are to be avoided. And this leads me to the <HI>Second Reque&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Reque&s;t.</HI> When you hear any Mini&s;ters, in preach|ing the Go&s;pel, u&s;e the Words <HI>Free and ab&s;olute, Condi|tional, Unconditional, Promi&s;es, Laws, Threatnings, Com|mands,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Exerci&s;e &s;o much Charity as to believe they u&s;e them in &s;uch a Sen&s;e as the Scripture approves of, and as &s;ecures the Salvation of Men,</HI> according to their &s;in|cere&s;t Apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>If the Preacher &s;peak of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> as a free and ab&s;olute <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> always &s;uppo&s;e he intends al&s;o, that all the Duties of Repentance and Holine&s;s are nece&s;|&s;ary, in order to Salvation, though he does not like to call them <HI>Conditions.</HI> If another &s;hould in&s;i&s;t much on <HI>Conditions</HI> in the Go&s;pel, &s;uppo&s;e he means none of them to be performed merely by your own Strength, nor to
<PB N="67" REF="006440_0082_1028EFE2FB756F80">
include any Thing of <HI>Merit</HI> in them. If he &s;peak of the <HI>Laws of Chri&s;t,</HI> under&s;tand him concerning all tho&s;e Rules and Directions, and Commands, which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> hath given to his Followers, but not in the &s;trict and perfect Notion of a <HI>Law.</HI> Even if he calls the Go&s;pel a <HI>Law,</HI> believe that he intends it only in the large&s;t Sen&s;e, and doth not mean that we are ju&s;tified in the Sight of God, by our Performance of the Duties of this Law as the proper Matter of our Righteou&s;ne&s;s before God: Or if he &s;hould happen to mention any &s;uch Thing as Ju&s;tification by our good Works of Holine&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> take due Heed to the Connection, and let Charity per&s;uade you that he is &s;peaking concerning <HI>Ju&s;tifica|tion before Men,</HI> or <HI>Ju&s;tification in our own Con&s;ciences,</HI> or <HI>in the Day of Judgment,</HI> and not of a Sinner's Ju&s;tify|ing Righteou&s;ne&s;s in the Sight of God, when he is fir&s;t converted and accepted of him through Faith in <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Suffer not your Di&s;gu&s;t and Anger immediately to be kindled at the Sound of any of the&s;e Words, as though they were at once undermining and perverting the Go&s;pel of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Nor ever give your &s;elf leave to reproach Mini&s;ters, as no Preachers of the Go&s;pel, merely becau&s;e they chu&s;e other Modes of Expre&s;&s;ion than tho&s;e which you mo&s;t e&s;teem, and frequently u&s;e, for &s;uch a Conduct will warp and bind down the Con|&s;ciences and Spirits of Men to a narrow and an uncha|ritable Partiality. This will render every Sermon of|fen&s;ive to them that is not conceived ju&s;t in their be|loved Language, and will utterly prevent their Profit by the various Gifts <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> has be&s;towed on his Mini&s;|ters. There are &s;ome common <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> in our Age, who are mo&s;t unhappy In&s;tances of this <HI>unchri&s;tian</HI> Temper; and 'tis to the&s;e Per&s;ons chiefly, that I give his <HI>&s;econd Advice.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Reque&s;t. Avoid all the high Flights and Extremes
<PB N="68" REF="006440_0083_1028EFE5995EA100">
of zealous Party Men,</HI> and which Way of Preaching &s;o|ever you approve and pur&s;ue, be &s;ure to guard again&s;t all Extremes, both of Notion and Language. Let the Hopes of exalting Free Grace never per&s;uade you to neglect to enforce the Duties of the Go&s;pel, and to pre&s;s them with Zeal on the Con&s;ciences of all Men: Nor let the Fear of encouraging Licentiou&s;ne&s;s ever tempt you to turn the Go&s;pel of Grace into a Covenant of Works: For God in his Go&s;pel of Free Grace hath &s;ufficiently provided for the Honour of his Holine&s;s, and the Sanctification of his own Children.</P>
<P>You will tell me here perhaps, that Scripture it&s;elf u&s;eth Expre&s;&s;ions as high upon particular Occa&s;ions, and as much leaning to Extremes as any Men of Party among us. But remember then, that the Scripture u&s;es &s;uch &s;trong and high Expre&s;&s;ions not on one Side only, but on both Sides, and infinite Wi&s;dom hath done this more forcibly to argue and impre&s;s &s;ome pre&s;ent Truth or Duty: But while it is evident the holy Writers have u&s;ed high Expre&s;&s;ions, &s;trong Figures of Speech, and vehement Turns on both Sides, this &s;uf|ficiently in&s;tructs us that we &s;hould be moderate in our Cen&s;ures of either Side, and that the calm doctrinal Truth, &s;tript of all Rhetoric and Figures, lies nearer to the middle, or at lea&s;t that &s;ome of the&s;e appear|ing Extremes, are more reconcilable than angry Men will generally allow. If the Apo&s;tle charges the <HI>Corinthians, So run that ye may obtain,</HI> 1 Cor. ix. 24. and tells the <HI>Romans, it is not of him that willeth or of him that runneth, but of God who &s;heweth Mercy,</HI> Rom. ix. 16. we may plainly infer that our Running and his Mercy, our Diligence and Divine Grace, are both nece&s;&s;ary to our Salvation.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>Reque&s;t. Let the particular Tempers, Temptations and Dangers of Per&s;ons with whom you conver&s;e, or with whom you preach, together with the growing Errors of the
<PB N="69" REF="006440_0084_1028EFE9C1B9E118">
Times, have always &s;ome Weight with you, to bend your Mini&s;try a little more the one way or the other:</HI> And never affect to preach the&s;e Matters in a di&s;putative and controver&s;ial Way, but rather in a plain and prac|tical Form, except the Temptations of the Age and Nation, or of particular Churches or Chri&s;tians &s;eem to demand it. And indeed this &s;eems to be one great Rea&s;on, why Scripture it&s;elf in different Parts of it &s;ometimes manages the Argument in a way of Di&s;pute, and at other times gives a different practical Turn to the &s;ame Truth, and u&s;es &s;o different Language in the Repre&s;entation of the &s;ame Doctrines. For the &s;e|veral Books of Scripture were written according to the various Nece&s;&s;ities of the Church of God, and to ob|viate Temptations of contrary Kinds, and to prevent the Danger of Errors ari&s;ing, by running to Extremes on either Side.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t Age, in the Times of the Civil Wars, <HI>Antinomiani&s;m</HI> and Errors of that Nature, were very common in the Nation: This turned the Labours and Study of many pious Men to vindicate and preach up the Duties of the Go&s;pel, and Works of Holine&s;s, as the proper Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Day. In this pre&s;ent Age, the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Pelagian</HI> Doctrines of Ju&s;tification by Works, and Salvation by the Power of our own Free|will, are publickly maintained and preach'd abundantly through the Land: The <HI>Socinian</HI> and the <HI>Arminian</HI> Errors are revived and &s;pread exceedingly, whereby <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is robb'd of his God-head, or his Satisfac|tion, or both, and the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit deny'd in the Glory of his Offices: For <HI>Dei&s;m</HI> and <HI>Natural Religion,</HI> in Oppo&s;ition to <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> daily prevail.</P>
<P>Now, perhaps, &s;ome may think it the Duty and Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Day to temporize, and by preaching the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> a little more conformably to <HI>Natural Religion,</HI> in a mere rational or legal Form, to bring it down as
<PB N="70" REF="006440_0085_1028EFEB4C434C28">
near as may be to their Scheme, that we may gain them to hear and approve it, or at lea&s;t, that we may not offend them. But I am rather of Opi|nion, that we &s;hould in &s;uch a Day &s;tand up for the Defence of the Go&s;pel in the full Glory of its mo&s;t important Doctrines, and in the full Freedom of its Grace; that we &s;hould preach it in its divine&s;t and mo&s;t Evangelical Form, that the Cro&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> by the promi&s;ed Power of the Spirit, may vanqui&s;h the vain Rea&s;onings of Men, and that this de&s;pi&s;ed Doctrine triumphing in the Conver&s;ion of Souls, may confound the Wi&s;e and the Mighty, and &s;ilence the Di&s;puters of this World. This was the bold and glorious Method St. <HI>Paul</HI> took at <HI>Corinth,</HI> where Learning and Rea&s;on and Philo&s;ophy flouri&s;hed in Pride; but they yielded &s;everal Trophies of Victory to the preaching of the Cro&s;s. <HI>Paul</HI> could u&s;e the <HI>Wi&s;dom of Words</HI> when&s;o|ever he had occa&s;ion for it, and had the <HI>Excellency of Speech</HI> at command when he plea&s;ed: this appears in &s;everal Parts of his Writings; yet in his Sermons at <HI>Corinth,</HI> he di&s;claimed it all, and <HI>determined to know nothing among them but Chri&s;t, and him crucified.</HI> 1 Cor. ii. 2.</P>
<P>Happy that Man who hath attained the holy Skill of joining Promi&s;es and Commands, Duties and Privileges, Authority, Terror and Grace; and who mingles them all wi&s;ely in his Mini&s;try; who hath learnt of St. <HI>Paul</HI> the Divine Art of addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Rea&s;on, the Con&s;ciences, and the Pa&s;&s;ions of Men in &s;uch variety of Expre&s;&s;ions, of Power, Terror and Love, as may mo&s;t effectually an&s;wer the Ends of his Office. Happy is he that knows how to di&s;play the Go&s;pel in all Forms under which Scripture repre&s;ents it, to preach to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and to teach the <HI>Gentiles</HI>; to talk to the Righ|teous and the Wicked in proper Language, to the ob|&s;tinate Rebel, to the trembling Sinner, and to the mourning Saint. Happy is he that <HI>becomes all to all that
<PB N="71" REF="006440_0086_1028EFEE0FC458B0">
he may gain the more</HI> Souls, 1 Cor. ix. 19, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;ome|times as <HI>without the Law, yet under a Law to Chri&s;t</HI>; &s;ometimes as with the Law, yet free from the Bondage of it; that never <HI>&s;trives about Words to no Profit,</HI> but <HI>knows how to divide the Word of Truth aright,</HI> and to <HI>give every one their Portion:</HI> This is the <HI>Workman that needs not to be a&s;hamed,</HI> and hath mo&s;t rea&s;on to hope for Succe&s;s. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> ii. 14, 15.</P>
<P>To conclude, <HI>Let us all apply our&s;elves with unbia&s;s'd Minds, with new Diligence and fervent Prayers, to &s;earch the Word of God, and draw all our Notions of the Go&s;pel thence:</HI> Let us enquire into the &s;piritual State, the Dangers and Nece&s;&s;ities of the People to whom we mini&s;ter, and this will be of great U&s;e to guide us to proper Subjects and Methods of Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Let our Conver&s;ation be &s;uch, as becomes the Go&s;pel in every Form of it, whether ab&s;olute or conditional. Let our clo&s;e walking with God be exemplary and in|&s;tructive, that Men may &s;ee our Religion as well as hear it, and all may confe&s;s, that while we preach the Go&s;pel, we are zealous Ob&s;ervers of the Law. Let us maintain upon our own Hearts a &s;weet and honour|able Sen&s;e of the Riches of Free Grace in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> together with a tender Sen&s;e of the Evil of Sin, and a lively Delight in Holine&s;s, that the daily Experience of our own Souls, and our inward Chri&s;tianity which is taught us, and wrought in us by the Spirit of God, may in&s;truct us how to preach to others.</P>
<P>Let that Go&s;pel which is <HI>written in the fle&s;hly Tables of our Hearts, i. e.</HI> in our very Souls, <HI>by the Finger of God,</HI> be manife&s;ted in every Part of our Mini&s;trations for the Good of Men. Thus we &s;hall obtain the Ap|probation of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> our Judge, in preaching his Go&s;pel of Faith and Love, and thus &s;hall we have the Plea&s;ure of this Te&s;timony in our own Con&s;ciences, that in the general Cour&s;e of our Mini&s;try we have &s;ought to &s;ave
<PB N="72" REF="006440_0087_1028EFF0DBF82030">
the Souls of others in the &s;ame way as we our&s;elves have &s;ought to be &s;aved: And that we have propo&s;ed the &s;ame Truths to them, and recommended the &s;ame Du|ties, which we our&s;elves believe and practi&s;e, in order to our own Salvation. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<P>HERE it will be nece&s;&s;ary to run over the &s;hort Con|ference between <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and this young Man, which is recorded by &s;everal of the Evangeli&s;ts, becau&s;e it will give us a plainer Account how the&s;e Words are introduced, and lead us into the Knowledge of the true De&s;ign of them.</P>

<P>The Per&s;on who addre&s;&s;ed the Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> here, was a young Man, and wealthy, as this &s;acred Writer informs us; and that he was a Ruler among the <HI>Jews,</HI> St. <HI>Luke</HI> gives us notice, <HI>Luke</HI> xviii. 18. That he was either a <HI>Phari&s;ee,</HI> or at lea&s;t one of the &s;tricter &s;ort of the <HI>Jews,</HI> &s;eems evident, becau&s;e he &s;ought after Eternal Life, whereas the <HI>Sadducees</HI> deny'd a future State, many of the higher as well as the loo&s;er Part of the Nation di&s;regarded it. He appears leaven'd with the common Phari&s;aical Doctrine, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that the way to <HI>procure Eternal Life</HI> was by his own good Works, by <HI>doing &s;ome good Thing.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis probable he had heard of the Miracles and the Fame of our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord, and believed him to be a Teacher &s;ent from God, for he comes in an humble manner as to a divine Prophet, he &s;eems to be in good earne&s;t in the Que&s;tion which he puts to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and &s;eriou&s;ly concerned about the Welfare of his Soul. He did not come with a De&s;ign to en&s;nare <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in his Words, as that &s;ort of Men (<HI>viz.</HI>) the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> often did: Nor did he come with u&s;ele&s;s perplexing Que&s;tions, as the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Sadducees</HI> and <HI>Lawyers</HI> &s;ometimes had done: But, as St. <HI>Mark</HI> relates the Hi&s;tory, he &s;hew'd &s;ome Tokens of Sincerity. <HI>Mark</HI> x. 17. for <HI>He came running to Je&s;us</HI> with Diligence and Speed, longing to have the Opinion of a new Prophet

about a Matter of &s;uch Importance, as the obtaining of Eternal Life: <HI>He kneeled down to him,</HI> and paid our Saviour much civil Re&s;pect: He received the Direc|tions of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> with Attention, and when he found in his Heart that his Love to his Riches would not let him comply with the Terms propo&s;ed, <HI>he went away &s;orrowful.</HI> There was &s;omething in his De&s;ign and in his Deportment, that was lovely and amiable, and we find that our Saviour (as a Man) looked on him with a Love of Complacency, <HI>Mark</HI> x. 21.

<PB N="76" REF="006440_0091_1028EFFBDC637C90">
and thereby to atone for the neglect of the re&s;t. This was an Error that prevailed among the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> in our Saviour's Time, as &s;eems to be &s;ufficiently evi|dent from their Doctrine, as it is repre&s;ented, Matt. xv. 5, 6. <HI>Who&s;oever &s;hall make a great Pre&s;ent</HI> to God and his Temple (as &s;ome interpret the Word <HI>Corban,</HI> or a Gift) <HI>he &s;hall be free</HI> from all relative Duties to <HI>Parents,</HI> &amp;c. So <HI>Matt.</HI> xxiii. 23. if they did but <HI>pay Tythes</HI> duly to the Prie&s;t they might be &s;aved, though they <HI>neglected the weighty Matters of the Law, Ju&s;tice, Judgment and Mercy, and the Love of God.</HI> So the <HI>Phari&s;ee</HI> that went into the Temple to pray, <HI>he fa&s;ted twice a-week, and gave Tythes of all that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed,</HI> and he accounted him&s;elf Righteous. <HI>Luke</HI> xviii. 12.</P>
<P>And upon this account you find the Que&s;tion pro|po&s;ed el&s;ewhere to our Saviour, Matt. xxii. 36. <HI>Which is the great Commandment of the Law?</HI> Some were for <HI>Circumci&s;ion,</HI> as a mo&s;t ancient Precept, and therefore of the mo&s;t general Obligation: Some for the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> becau&s;e it was &s;o &s;trictly enjoined to the <HI>Jews:</HI> And &s;ome for <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> as being in their Opinion a &s;ufficient Expiation and Atonement for any other Defects what|&s;oever. They thought one or other of the&s;e to be the critical Points on which Salvation depended.</P>
<P>And generally we find that the Commands of God, of an external or <HI>Ceremonial</HI> Nature, or the mere Inven|tions and Traditions of Men, were thus aggrandized by the Teachers of the <HI>Jews,</HI> as though Heaven might be obtain'd in a &s;hort way, by practi&s;ing tho&s;e Formalities, without the long Labours of Watchfulne&s;s and Ab&s;tinence from Sin, and Obedience to every moral Command of the Law. Yet we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e this Per&s;on to be one of the better &s;ort of them too, for he had endeavoured to keep the <HI>Moral Law,</HI> (at lea&s;t in the outward and vi&s;ible Duties of it) as well as <HI>Ceremonial,</HI> even from his Youth up, as he tells our Saviour.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="77" REF="006440_0092_1028EFFFFA7729C0">III. Or we may &s;uppo&s;e this young Man hearing the Fame of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as the great Prophet that was to come into the World, might expect &s;ome new and unheard-of Doctrines, &s;ome new and unknown way to Heaven, which the Law and the Old Prophets had never &s;poken of; e&s;pecially &s;ince he thought he had already fulfilled all that they had required: And therefore he came running to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> kneeling down with earne&s;t De&s;ire to be taught this new Revelation, this Method of ob|taining Heaven and eternal Life, which the new Prophet was &s;ent to teach: And perhaps he might imagine <HI>Je&s;us</HI> to be the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI>: And they knew that <HI>when the</HI> Me&s;&s;iah <HI>came he would teach them all things,</HI> which all the former Prophets&punc; and <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> him&s;elf had not fully acquainted them with, <HI>John</HI> iv. 25.</P>
<P>Or may we not &s;uppo&s;e all the&s;e three De&s;igns toge|ther, to be in the Heart of this young Queri&s;t?

And whereas the Statutes and Ceremonies, and Commands and Judg|ments, and Duties of the Law, are very numerous and difficult, is there no one good thing that may be as acceptable to God as all the re&s;t, and give me a Title to eternal Happine&s;s, in a &s;hort and com|pendious manner? Or is there any new way to Heaven which thou di&s;covere&s;t to Men? As thou &s;eeme&s;t to preach up a future State, a Heaven and a Hell in the other World, do&s;t thou come to give any new Directions how to avoid this Hell, and obtain this Heaven?</Q></P>
<P>Our Lord, before he an&s;wered his Que&s;tion, takes Occa&s;ion to ask him, <HI>why he called him Good,</HI> which
<PB N="78" REF="006440_0093_1028F0018D3103A0">
was a Title that eminently belonged to God only: The be&s;t conjecture that Interpreters can make of this Query, is this, (<HI>viz.) Je&s;us</HI> &s;earched into his Opinion concerning him&s;elf, whether he knew or believed that he was the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> or the Son of God, who was <HI>one with the Father,</HI> and thereby had a Right to Divine Titles and Characters, and might ju&s;tly be called <HI>Good</HI> in a Divine Sen&s;e. Perhaps <HI>Je&s;us</HI> might have, before this time, manife&s;ted this his own <HI>Onene&s;s with God</HI>; but if he had not, yet there were &s;everal De&s;criptions of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> in the Old Te&s;tament, wherein the Names and Titles of the true God are given to the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> which could not be given him without &s;uch a <HI>Onene&s;s with God,</HI> and therefore he might ju&s;tly take Occa&s;ion to catechi&s;e &s;uch a forward young Man who &s;eemed to be conceited of his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 'Tis as if <HI>Je&s;us</HI> had &s;aid, <Q>Thou calle&s;t me <HI>Good:</HI> There is none originally, eternally and perfectly good but God him&s;elf; none good as God is; none hath right to the Title in the mo&s;t ab&s;olute and exalted Sen&s;e of it but God: Why then do&s;t thou u&s;e this Salutation to me, and give me this Title? Do&s;t thou think any thing more than Human dwells in me?</Q> <Q>Ha&s;t thou known or ob&s;erved any of tho&s;e Speeches or tho&s;e Miracles of mine, whereby I have a&s;&s;erted and proved that <HI>I am in the Father and the Father in me,</HI> or, that <HI>I am one with the Father,</HI> and &s;o partake with him in the Title of <HI>Good?</HI></Q> See <HI>John</HI> x. 30, 37, 38. and xiv, 8, 9, 10.</P>
<P>Here it may be remarked, that our Saviour did not u&s;e to publi&s;h his own Divinity or Onene&s;s with God, in plain and expre&s;s Terms to the People, but generally by &s;uch Methods of Enquiry and In&s;inuation. See <HI>Mark</HI> ii. 5. &mdash; 11. where he had forgiven the Sins of a Man that was &s;ick of the Pal&s;y before he healed him; and then he proves by the Miracle of healing, that he
<PB N="79" REF="006440_0094_1028F0049A79C948">
had a Right to forgive Sin, while the <HI>Jews</HI> acknow|ledge that none could forgive Sins but God alone. So <HI>John</HI> x. 30, &mdash; 36. after he had given a hint of his Deity, by &s;aying, <HI>I and my father are one,</HI> the <HI>Jews</HI> would have &s;toned him for pretending to be God; which he an&s;wers by &s;uch an Enquiry; Since tho&s;e are called <HI>Gods</HI> in Scripture, <HI>to whom the Word of God came, &s;ay ye of him whom the Father hath &s;anctified and &s;ent into the World, he bla&s;phemeth, becau&s;e I &s;aid I am the Son of God?</HI> Such a &s;ort of oblique In&s;inuation, or En|quiry concerning the Divinity of his Per&s;on, &s;eems to be our Lord's De&s;ign in this Text. If this be not the Purport and Intention of this Que&s;tion, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I am ignorant of the De&s;ign of it. But this &s;eems to me the mo&s;t probable Conjecture.</P>
<P>Then immediately he proceeds to give our young Queri&s;t an An&s;wer to his Que&s;tion, <HI>If thou wilt enter into Life keep the Commandments.</HI></P>
<P>The young Man again &s;eems to have his former De&s;igns in his Eye, when he asks <HI>which Commandment he &s;hould keep?</HI> As if he &s;hould &s;ay, <Q>Is it any one particular Commandment or Commandments of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> that I mu&s;t keep? and if I have kept them, is there any new Commandment thou wilt give me, whereby eternal Life will be in&s;ured to me?</Q></P>
<P>Our Lord replies, Keep the common Commandments of the Law, <HI>Thou knowe&s;t them,</HI> as Mark x. 17. 'Tis not by ob&s;erving any one Command and neglecting the re&s;t, but the way to enter into Life is Obedience to all the old Commandments, for <HI>I am not come to break</HI> or di&s;&s;olve <HI>the Law of God, but to</HI> confirm or <HI>fulfil it,</HI> Matt. v. 17, 19. And though our Lord <HI>Je&s;us&punc;</HI> mentions only tho&s;e of the &s;econd Table, and the Duties towards <HI>Men,</HI> yet we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e he means inclu&s;ively all the re&s;t; for he &s;aith in Matt. v. 19. <HI>Who&s;oever &s;hall teach Men to break the lea&s;t of the Commandments of the Law,
<PB N="80" REF="006440_0095_1028F006782FAAC0">
&s;hall be the lea&s;t in the Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> i. e. &s;hall have no Place there. Our Saviour doth not give a Di&s;pen&s;ation to neglect Duties toward God, by men|tioning only the Duties toward our Neighbour; but the Rea&s;on why he mentions them &s;eem chiefly the&s;e two.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e the&s;e Duties to their <HI>Neighbours</HI> were tho&s;e which the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> who boa&s;ted of their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, more particularly neglected, while they pretended to much Devotion and Wor&s;hip of God in all the Forms of his Appointment; And therefore our Lord in&s;i&s;ts particularly upon the&s;e Commands that relate to our Fellow-Creatures, to &s;hew him that the&s;e were as nece&s;&s;ary a Part of his Duty, as all the more pompous Services of God in his Temple.</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e it might be more ea&s;y for his own Con|&s;cience to convince him of the Neglect of the&s;e moral and relative Duties towards his Fellow-Creatures, than of his Neglect of religious Duties towards God: And our Saviour thought when he had named the&s;e, he had named Commandments enough to &s;hew him the Im|perfection of his Righteou&s;ne&s;s: Therefore he don't proceed to mention them all.</P>
<P>And it may be noted, that our Lord reckons up the&s;e Commands not in their exact Order, nor exactly in the Words of the Old Te&s;tament, but with a more loo&s;e and negligent way of repeating them, becau&s;e he &s;poke to a Man that was &s;uppo&s;ed to know them already: <HI>Thou knowe&s;t</HI> all <HI>the Commandments</HI> which I refer to, even the Commands of the moral Law, <HI>Do not kill, do not &s;teal,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<PB N="81" REF="006440_0096_1028F00AA68B5AF8">
into Sight: In what Sen&s;e did our Saviour &s;peak the&s;e Words to the young Enquirer, <HI>If thou wilt enter into Life keep the Commandments?</HI> Did he de&s;ign to give him a plain and direct An&s;wer how he might obtain Eternal Life and Salvation, according to the <HI>Go&s;pel?</HI> or did he de&s;ign only to convince him of Sin, by preaching the <HI>Law</HI> to him, in order to make him &s;ee his Guilt and Mi&s;ery, that he might &s;eek after a better Righteou&s;ne&s;s than that of the Works of the Law, another way of obtaining Acceptance with God and Eternal Life, than merely by his Doings?</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, the la&s;t of the&s;e &s;eems to be the De&s;ign of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> He did not intend in the&s;e Words to give him immediate and direct In&s;truction, how he might actually obtain Salvation, but rather fir&s;t to convince him of Sin, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and I would offer the&s;e following Rea&s;ons for it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Rea&s;on.</HI> The An&s;wer of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is exactly &s;uited to his Que&s;tion. Now his Que&s;tion was about <HI>Eternal Life to be obtain'd by Works,</HI> and not about the <HI>Salva|tion of a Sinner</HI> by the <HI>Mercy</HI> of God. He did not ask, as the convinced Jaylor, Acts xvi. 30. <HI>What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved,</HI> or to obtain Salvation? But <HI>What g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> Work mu&s;t I do to obtain Eternal Life by it?</HI></P>
<P>It is granted that <HI>Eternal Life</HI> is &s;ometimes put for the final Happine&s;s of Believers under the Go&s;pel, be|cau&s;e it is included in the Salvation of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>; yet <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Eternal Life</HI> are peculiarly and properly the Ble&s;|&s;ings promi&s;ed in the Law of Works, in which Sen&s;e the Word <HI>Salvation</HI> is never u&s;ed; and the Scripture in &s;ome Places by this way of Expre&s;&s;ion makes this Di&s;|tinction evident. See the Terms of the <HI>Law</HI> or Cove|nant of Works, both in its <HI>Command</HI> and its <HI>Reward,</HI> as it is de&s;cribed in direct oppo&s;ition to the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> and Method of Salvation, in Rom. x. 5, 6. <HI>Mo&s;es de&s;cribeth the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of the Law, that the Man who
<PB N="82" REF="006440_0097_1028F00D279CEA38">
doth the&s;e Things &s;hall live by them</HI>; whereas the <HI>Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of Faith (i. e.</HI> the way of Ju&s;tification and Ac|ceptance with God by the Go&s;pel) <HI>&s;ays</HI> quite other things, <HI>If thou &s;halt believe and confe&s;s</HI> Chri&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So St. <HI>Paul</HI> de&s;cribes the promi&s;ed Ble&s;&s;ings of the Law of Works in the &s;ame manner in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Ga|latians,</HI> Gal. iii. 12. <HI>The Law is not of Faith, but the Man who doth them &s;hall live in them. Life</HI> is &s;till the Word of the Promi&s;e. And in <HI>Rom.</HI> ii. 6, 7. where the Apo&s;tle is properly preaching the Law of Works with the Terms of it, 'tis called <HI>Immortality, Eternal Life,</HI> to be obtained by <HI>continuance in good Works</HI> or <HI>well-doing.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis this <HI>Eternal Life</HI> and <HI>Immortality</HI> which was imply'd in the Covenant of Works which God made with <HI>Adam.</HI> If he eat the forbidden Fruit he &s;hould <HI>die</HI>; but if he ob&s;erved the Commands of God, he &s;hould <HI>live</HI>; and the <HI>Tree of Life</HI> in the mid&s;t of the Garden was a Symbol or Sacrament of <HI>Life</HI> and Im|mortality to &s;eal this Promi&s;e to Man, if he continued in his Obedience to God.</P>
<P>Our Lord therefore gives an An&s;wer exactly accord|ing to the Que&s;tion, <HI>What good Thing &s;hall I do for Eternal Life?</HI> &s;aith the Enquirer. <HI>Keep the Command|ments,</HI> &s;aith our Lord. When the young Man pro|po&s;es his Que&s;tion about final Happine&s;s in the Terms and Language of the Covenant of Works, our Lord gives an An&s;wer in the &s;ame Language. <Q>If thou wilt obtain Life by doing Works, the&s;e are the Works which thou mu&s;t do, even the Works of the moral Law.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Rea&s;on.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> the chief Mini&s;ter of the Covenant of Grace would not give this Direc|tion to obtain the Salvation and Benefits thereof, be|cau&s;e 'tis the mo&s;t direct An&s;wer which a Preacher of the Covenant of Works could give to this &s;ame En|quiry; <HI>If thou wilt enter into Life keep the Command|ments.</HI>

And this is very different from the Terms of Ju&s;tification and Salvation by the Go&s;pel, which ex|clude the Works of the Law, as the way to Pardon and Ju&s;tification, and refer us to <HI>Faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> See <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 11, 12. <HI>Rom.</HI> x. 5, 6. already cited. Is it not mo&s;t expre&s;ly a&s;&s;erted, that <HI>by the Works of the Law no Fle&s;h &s;hall be ju&s;tified?</HI> Rom. iii. 19, 20. Are not the&s;e Works perpetually excluded by the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle, when&s;oever he is de&s;cribing the mere Method of Grace and Salvation, or the Means for a Sinner to obtain his Acceptance with God unto Eternal Life? See Rom. iv. 4. <HI>To him that worketh the Reward is not reckon'd of Grace but of Debt: But to him that worketh not believeth on him that ju&s;tifies the ungodly (i. e.</HI> the Man who has no Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s an&s;werable to any Law) <HI>his Faith is counted for Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Gal. ii. 16. <HI>Knowing that a Man is not ju&s;tify'd by the Works of the Law, but by the Faith of Chri&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. See <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 8, 12.</P>
<P>And it is plain, that it is not merely the <HI>Law of Levitical Ceremonies</HI> that the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of, when he excludes the Works of it from our Ju&s;tification, for it is al&s;o that <HI>Law which is written by Nature in the Hearts</HI> and Con&s;ciences of the <HI>Gentiles, Rom.</HI> ii. 14, 15. It is the Law that forbids <HI>Stealing and Adultery, Rom.</HI> ii. 21, 22.

him&s;elf righteous, and never confe&s;s'd him&s;elf a Sinner, but enquired about obtaining Life by his good Works?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Rea&s;on.</HI> 'Tis hardly to be thought that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hould direct a Man to fulfil the Commands of the Moral Law as the proper way for him to obtain Eternal Life, when through the Weakne&s;s of our &s;inful Nature, he knew the Law could not give Life to Men in their fallen E&s;tate, and he him&s;elf was &s;ent to provide another way for them to obtain Life. Rom. viii. 3. <HI>What the Law could not do in that it was weak through the Fle&s;h, God &s;ent his own Son</HI> to do for us. Rom. iii. 20. <HI>By the Deeds of the Law there &s;hall no Fle&s;h be ju&s;tified in his Sight.</HI> This does not ari&s;e from any Weakne&s;s or In|&s;ufficiency of the Law it&s;elf, for it &s;till promi&s;es Life, and would &s;ecure it to any Man who was perfect with|out Sin. But as the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>'Tis become weak thro' the Fle&s;h, i. e.</HI> becau&s;e Man is &s;o much immer&s;ed in Fle&s;h and Sin, that he cannot perfectly fulfil it. The Law cannot give the Favour of God and Eternal Life, becau&s;e Man cannot obey it.</P>
<P>And upon this Account <HI>the Law</HI> of ten Commands which was <HI>engraven in Stones</HI> is called <HI>the Mini&s;tration of Condemnati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n and Death,</HI> 2 Cor. iii. 7, 9. and not the <HI>Mini&s;tration of Life and Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI>; that is the pecu|liar Glory of the Go&s;pel. <HI>The Law</HI> indeed <HI>is holy and ju&s;t and good,</HI> and it was originally ordained <HI>for Life</HI> to innocent Man: But when the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> came to have his Con&s;cience awaken'd to a Sen&s;e of Sin by the Law, he found it to <HI>be unto Death,</HI> Rom. vii. 10. partly by &s;hewing him his Imperfection of Obedience, as well as by irritating his indwelling &s;inful Inclinations. So far is the Law from giving Life to Sinners.</P>
<P>God honours his Laws &s;o much that the Scripture a&s;&s;ures us, <HI>If there had been a Law which could have given Life,</HI> Eternal Life, <HI>verily Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Ju&s;tification and Happine&s;s <HI>&s;hould have come by the Law.</HI> Gal. iii. 21, 22.

<P><PB N="86" REF="006440_0101_1028DB0A4AD6B820">And 'tis well worthy our Notice, that the publick Promulgation of the ten Commandments, with &s;uch &s;olemn Terrors at Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> was de&s;ign'd, in the &s;piritual Intention of it, to lay the Con&s;ciences of Men under Guilt, rather than to make them partakers of Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Life, <HI>Rom.</HI> v. 20. <HI>The Law enter'd that the Offence might abound,</HI> i. e. that the Sins of Men might appear to be great and numerous, beyond what their carnal Imaginations would have &s;uppo&s;ed, without the expre&s;s Letter of the Law, which forbids <HI>coveting,</HI> &amp;c. The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> tells us, <HI>Rom.</HI> vii. 7. <HI>He had not known this Concupi&s;cence to be Sin but by the Law</HI>; and that u&s;eful Expo&s;itor of Scripture, Mr. <HI>Samuel Clark,</HI> (who is not wont to be too Evangelical in his Expo|&s;itions) remarks on <HI>Exod.</HI> xix. 24. <Q>That the Charge of forbidding the People to come near Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> is often repeated, <HI>le&s;t God break forth upon them,</HI> to &s;hew that the End of the Law is rather to exclude Men from God, by rea&s;on of their Sins, than to ju&s;tify or to give Life; for which he cites, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> iii. 7. <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 10 &mdash; 24.</Q></P>
<P>And indeed this was one con&s;iderable part of the De&s;ign and Bu&s;ine&s;s of our Saviour's per&s;onal Mini&s;try here upon Earth, (<HI>viz.) to preach the Law of God in its Perfection, and convince Men of Sin,</HI> to let them &s;ee that they were condemned and expo&s;ed to the Wrath of God, that they might learn the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Saviour to atone for Sin, and of the Mercy of God to pardon it. He de&s;cribed the Purity and Exactne&s;s of the Law, not only to teach his Di&s;ciples and all &s;uc|ceeding Chri&s;tians, that their Obedience to the Law of God ought to be more exact and pure, more inward and &s;piritual, than what the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> required or prac|ti&s;ed, but al&s;o to &s;hew Men the Imperfection of their be&s;t Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and that they were all guilty before God, that he might prepare them to receive the Go&s;pel,

partly by his own preaching it, and e&s;pecially when it &s;hould be publi&s;hed in greater Brightne&s;s and Clear|ne&s;s, and in its full Glory, after his Re&s;urrection.</P>
<P>Was not this one great De&s;ign of his Sermon upon the Mount, where he explains the Law of God in its Lengths and Breadths, and &s;hews that it reaches to the Thoughts of Men as well as their Actions? Did he not begin this Sermon with, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the Poor in Spirit,</HI> Matt. v. 3. that he might &s;hew the way to Ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s was not a <HI>Self-Sufficience of Soul,</HI> and a <HI>Tru&s;t</HI> in our own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, but a <HI>&s;piritual Poverty, i. e.</HI> a hum|ble Sen&s;e of our own Weakne&s;s and Sinfulne&s;s? What mean many of his Parables, particularly that of the <HI>prodigal Son returning</HI> in Rags and Sorrow <HI>to his Father's Hou&s;e?</HI> Doth it not teach us that the way to be ac|cepted of our heavenly Father is to return to him with a deep Sen&s;e of our Di&s;obedience, Sin and Mi&s;ery, with a humble Repentance, and asking Forgivene&s;s? What is the Intent of the Parable of the <HI>Phari&s;ee and Publican going up to pray?</HI> Is it not to &s;hew us that a humble, confe&s;&s;ing, repenting Sinner &s;eeking for Mercy, is much nearer to Ju&s;tification and the Favour of God, than a Man who &s;preads abroad his own Righteou&s;|ne&s;s and ju&s;tifies him&s;elf? What means our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord in his perpetual Reproofs of the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> who <HI>tru&s;ted in them&s;elves that they were righteous?</HI> Did he not frequently talk thus to convince Men of Sin, and &s;hew them how imperfect their Obedience was, and how in&s;ufficient to procure Acceptance with God, and to let them &s;ee that Repentance and Confe&s;&s;ion of Sin, and Tru&s;t in Divine Mercy, were the only way to Salvation.</P>
<P>'Tis no wonder then if our Saviour had the &s;ame De&s;ign in his Eye when he &s;aw a rich young Man of a <HI>Phari&s;aical</HI> Spirit, come to enquire the way to Heaven by <HI>doing &s;ome good Work</HI>; 'tis no wonder that he begun
<PB N="88" REF="006440_0103_1028F014BB6ADC78">
to talk to him of Obedience to the Law, in order to convince him of Sin, and &s;hew him that he was not &s;ufficiently righteous to obtain Eternal Life by his Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>'Tis mo&s;t likely that our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord had a &s;pecial Intention in this Place to try the young Man, whether he knew his own State and Ca&s;e as a Sinner who wanted Pardon, and whether he was prepared for the Go&s;pel or no: Whether he &s;tood convinced of Sin, and de|&s;irous of true Salvation, &s;uch as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> came to procure for tho&s;e who were &s;en&s;ible of their Guilt and Danger. I have before &s;hewed that the fir&s;t Sentence that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;poke to him was with de&s;ign to try his Opinion about him&s;elf, the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> when he called him <HI>Good,</HI> whether he was one with God or no: And now he tries his Opinion about the inward and &s;piritual Perfection of the Law, and about his own Power to keep it, and about his own Hope of Ju&s;tification thereby: And therefore he at fir&s;t gives him &s;uch an An&s;wer as &s;hould make him bethink him&s;elf, whether he had obey'd the Law of God perfectly or no.</P>
<P>If he had found him &s;en&s;ible of his Guilt and his Im|perfections, then mo&s;t probably the compa&s;&s;ionate <HI>Je&s;us</HI> would have preached to him the pardoning Grace of the Go&s;pel, which he came to offer to tho&s;e who re|pent of Sin, and believe in the Saviour. But when he heard the vain Enquirer ju&s;tify him&s;elf as a righte|ous Man, and &s;ay, <HI>All the&s;e Commands have I kept from my Youth,</HI> then our Saviour put him to a fre&s;h and more painful Trial of his Sincerity and Obedience to God, and that partly for his Conviction, in&s;tead of &s;aying, <HI>Repent and believe;</HI> he did not proceed &s;o far as to preach Repentance to him, becau&s;e he &s;aw him &s;o much unconvinced of Sin; and he tells us that he came <HI>not to call the&s;e righteous Men but Sinners to Repen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ance,</HI>

<P>This leads me to the <HI>fifth</HI> or la&s;t Rea&s;on, to prove that this An&s;wer was not de&s;igned by <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as a Di|rection of the Queri&s;t how to obtain Salvation, (<HI>viz.</HI>) It is a quite different An&s;wer to the like Que&s;tions that is given by <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and by the Apo&s;tles, when they de&s;igned to preach the Go&s;pel in plain, direct and ex|pre&s;s Language, Mark i. 15. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;aith <HI>Repent and believe the Go&s;pel.</HI> John vi. 40. <HI>This is the Will of him that &s;ent me, that every one that &s;eeth the Son and believeth on him, hath everla&s;ting Life.</HI> And again, <HI>This is the Work of God,</HI> i. e. the great Work which God now re|quires, <HI>that ye believe on him whom he hath &s;ent,</HI> John vi. 28, 29. So preaches St. <HI>Peter,</HI> Acts ii. 38. <HI>Repent and be bapti&s;ed in the Name of</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t: So <HI>Paul,</HI> Acts xvi. 31. <HI>Believe in the Lord</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t <HI>and thou &s;halt be &s;aved:</HI> And &s;o <HI>John</HI> &s;peaks, <HI>This is his Com|mandment that ye believe on the Name of his Son</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t, 1 John iii. 23. The&s;e are the plain and direct Advices of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his Apo&s;tles to &s;inful Men, in order to obtain the Favour of God and Eternal Life.</P>
<P>To &s;uppo&s;e therefore that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> did in this Place, and in the&s;e Words, direct the Enquirer into the pro|per way of Salvation by the Go&s;pel, is to &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> differ'd greatly from him&s;elf, in the Directions he gave, how Men might be &s;aved; and that he and his Apo&s;tles, and particularly St. <HI>Paul,</HI> taught very dif|ferent Doctrines; that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> taught the Way to Sal|vation by the Works of the Law, and the Go&s;pel taught it by Faith and Repentance, without the Works of the Law. But this would &s;et <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his Apo&s;tles &s;o much at Variance with them&s;elves, that 'tis not to be admitted.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. III.</HI> An An&s;wer to &s;ome Objections.</HEAD>
<P>I come now to an&s;wer &s;ome <HI>Objections</HI> again&s;t my Sen&s;e of this Text, and the chief of them are taken from Dr. <HI>Whitby,</HI> a mo&s;t ingenious Writer on that Side.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 1. Doth not <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;ay, that <HI>to love the Lord our God is the Way to Life,</HI> Luke x. 27, 28? Is not this the &s;ame thing in effect, as when he directs the young Man to Eternal Life, by <HI>keeping the Commandments,</HI> and that in the &s;ame Language? For when the Lawyer enquires, <HI>What &s;hall I do to inherit Eternal Life? Je&s;us</HI> gives him this Advice, <HI>Love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and thy Neighbour as thy &s;elf: This do and thou &s;halt live.</HI> Thus Eternal Life is promi&s;ed by <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf, to our loving God and Man, which is the Epi|tome or Ab&s;tract of all the moral Commands in one, for <HI>Love is the fulfilling of the Law,</HI> Rom. xiii. 8, 10.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1. It is very plain that in that Place our Saviour is preaching the Covenant of Works, as well as in my Text, and that for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e too, (<HI>viz.</HI>) for the Conviction of Sin. This Lawyer was not a humble and &s;incere Enquirer, but one who came to tempt and en&s;nare him; and then 'tis no wonder if <HI>Je&s;us</HI> did not give him a plain and direct An&s;wer ac|cording to the Method of Salvation by the Go&s;pel. And though he directed others to believe and repent, yet he did not treat a vain young <HI>Phari&s;ee,</HI> who thought him&s;elf righteous, and a cunning Lawyer who de&s;ign'd to in&s;nare him, in the &s;ame manner that he would treat Per&s;ons who were &s;en&s;ible of their Sins, and &s;ought the way to obtain Pardon and Happine&s;s, nor did he give them the &s;ame Directions.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 2. Let it be further con&s;ider'd, that the Life-time of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was not the appointed Sea&s;on to &s;peak
<PB N="91" REF="006440_0106_1028F01CC621FA10">
the Glories of the Go&s;pel in the fulle&s;t and plaine&s;t Language, as I hinted before. His frequent Bu&s;ine&s;s and Practice was to preach the Law, to reprove Sin, and prepare Men for the fuller and more compleat Mini&s;try of the Go&s;pel, which after his Death he &s;ent his Apo&s;tles to preach by the Power of his own Spirit: And they publi&s;h'd the Go&s;pel of Salvation by Re|pentance and Faith in the Blood of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and For|givene&s;s through his Atonement, much plainer and clearer, and fuller than <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf did in his Life-time among the Multitudes. That Go&s;pel which he taught them &s;ecretly, <HI>they proclaimed</HI> as it were <HI>upon the Hou&s;e Tops,</HI> according to his Order, <HI>Matt.</HI> x. 27.</P>
<P>Though <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf gave &s;uch Hints of this Go&s;pel in his preaching, as were &s;ufficient for Salvation to tho&s;e that would receive them, yet he might be &s;aid to be &s;ent rather with this dreadful Commi&s;&s;ion to the Generality of the <HI>Jews,</HI> Matt. xiii. 13. I&s;a. vi. 10. <HI>Make the Heart of this People fat and their Ears heavy, and &s;hut their Eyes,</HI> &amp;c. They were &s;uch a &s;tubborn and &s;elf-conceited and di&s;obedient People, that God ju&s;tly gave them up to their own Blindne&s;s and Hard|ne&s;s: And for this Rea&s;on our Saviour &s;pake often the great things of the Go&s;pel to them in Parables<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Sect. <HI>5.</HI> Reflection. <HI>1.</HI></NOTE>. He was ordained to <HI>be a &s;tumbling Stone and Rock of Offence to the Hou&s;e of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>and</HI> Judah, I&s;a. viii. 14. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> ii. 8. and this by the ju&s;t Judgment of God, for their &s;toning the Prophets, and murdering the former Me&s;&s;engers of Heaven, for their for&s;aking the Law of God, and making it void by their Traditions, and for their vio|lent Oppo&s;ition to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> his Son. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was not al|ways bound to &s;peak the Go&s;pel to this People in as plain Words as he could, for Rea&s;ons that the Wi&s;dom of God was well acquainted with, Rea&s;ons that the Ju&s;|tice of God righteou&s;ly determined, and the Goodne&s;s of

God did not think fit to oppo&s;e. And 'tis no wonder at all that he doth &s;peak in this way to tho&s;e Men who came with curious Que&s;tions and with evil Pur|po&s;es to en&s;nare him, as the Lawyer did in this Account of St. <HI>Luke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> 2. But can we &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> would deceive a young Man, who came &s;eriou&s;ly to enquire the Way to Eternal Life? Can we imagine that <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> in whom dwells all Wi&s;dom, Truth and Love, &s;hould give &s;uch Directions as could never bring a Man to Heaven, and e&s;pecially con&s;idering that he came into the World on purpo&s;e <HI>to bring Life and Immortality to Light</HI> among Men, and to &s;hew them the true Way to Heaven?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. That we may &s;ecure the Goodne&s;s of God and the Mercy of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> from any Reproach in this Ca&s;e, I &s;ay further, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> did take a very wi&s;e and regular Method with this young Man to bring him to Salvation, if he would have &s;tay'd to attend to it, and had not been full of evil Prejudices, of Self Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and the Love of this World. For the fir&s;t thing to be done in order to bring Sinners to Heaven (as I hinted before) is to convince them of Sin, and this is done by the Law. This the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;heweth at large in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> that Men by be|holding the Perfection of the Law, and their Inability to perform it, might become <HI>Dead to all Hope from the Law,</HI> as he was when he &s;ays, Gal. ii. 19. <HI>I by the Law am dead to the Law</HI>; and that they might not expect Life by the Law, but that they might &s;eek for Salva|tion by the Way of Repentance and Faith, or Tru&s;t in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and obtain Forgivene&s;s of Sins through the free Grace of God in the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 2. Though this young Man had a vain Conceit of his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, yet there was &s;omething in him naturally plea&s;ing, agreeable and engaging, &s;o that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as Man <HI>looked upon him and loved him,</HI> Mark x. 21.
<PB N="93" REF="006440_0108_1028F021126B2A08">
He had &s;ome liking to &s;uch a towardly and hopeful Youth, and preach'd the Law to him, to convince him of Sin, in order to his Salvation: But when he pro|fe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to be &s;o righteous in his own Eyes, as to <HI>have kept all the Commands</HI> of the Law, his divine Wi&s;dom then &s;aw it proper to put a harder Trial upon him (<HI>viz.) to &s;ell all that he had and give to the Poor, and to become a Follower of Chri&s;t.</HI> Now if this young Man had loved God &s;o well as he pretended, and be|lieved <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to be a Prophet come from God, he ought to have obey'd him, even in this difficult and &s;elf-denying Command; which Command was put upon him, partly to convince him that he did not love God &s;o well as he imagined, and which hard Trial probably would never have been put upon him, if he had not been &s;o conceited of his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved al&s;o, to vindicate the Honour, Faithfulne&s;s and Goodne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> that if the young Man had followed the&s;e Directions of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> at the End of the Conference, he had been &s;aved: Our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord gave him &s;ufficient Advice for Eternal Life, if he would have taken it. <Q>Come, <HI>&s;ell what thou ha&s;t, and give it to the Poor, and follow me,</HI> and be my Di&s;ciple;</Q> and then it would follow, <Q>Thou &s;halt learn of me the Way to Heaven more perfectly, and I will teach thee the Way of Repentance, and Faith, and Holine&s;s unto compleat Salvation.</Q> But the young Man loved his Money, and went away &s;or|rowful, that he could not keep all his Riches and obtain Eternal Life too.</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> 3. Doth not God all along in the Writings of the Old Te&s;tament, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Ages, promi&s;e <HI>Life</HI> in this &s;ame &s;ort of Language to tho&s;e that ob&s;erve and do his Commandments, and that, both by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and by the <HI>Prophets?</HI> And did not the Saints, under the Old Te&s;tament, obtain Life this Way?

<HI>He that doth them</HI> (that is the Commands of God) <HI>&s;hall live in them,</HI> Ezek. xx. 11. this Promi&s;e is repeated: And in Ezek. xxx. 15. <HI>If the Wicked walk in the Statutes of Life, without committing Iniquity, he &s;hall &s;urely live, he &s;hall not die:</HI> Now this <HI>dying</HI> cannot mean <HI>a natural Death,</HI> for they knew they mu&s;t die Naturally; there|fore it mu&s;t mean <HI>a Deliverance from Eternal Death, and A&s;&s;urance of Eternal Life.</HI> <Q>'Tis therefore certain, that all pious Per&s;ons, under the Old Te&s;tament, ob|tain'd a Right to Life eternal, by this Ob&s;ervance of the moral Precepts of the Law.</Q> The&s;e are Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI>'s own Words.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. This Life which is here promi&s;ed in the&s;e Texts to the <HI>Jews,</HI> in a literal Sen&s;e, chiefly means <HI>long Life in their own Land,</HI> and Peace and Freedom from Sorrows and Mi&s;eries in this World: And though the Freedom or Pre&s;ervation from <HI>Death</HI> (which is promi&s;ed by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to tho&s;e who keep the Statutes, Laws and Ordinances enjoin'd to <HI>I&s;rael</HI>) does not mean an intire Pre&s;ervation from <HI>Temporal Death</HI>; &s;o neither in the obvious and literal Sen&s;e does it mean a Secu|rity from <HI>Eternal Death,</HI> but rather a Freedom from <HI>Death,</HI> as it is a general Term u&s;ed to include all tem|poral and painful Evils, and particularly from &s;udden and violent Death, from cruel, lingering and &s;hameful Death, from Death in foreign Countries, and untimely Death in the mid&s;t of their Years. This is very evident, if you read tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Mo&s;es, Deut.</HI> vi. 24, 25. and <HI>Deut.</HI> xxx. 15 &mdash; 30. <HI>Ezek.</HI> xxxiii. 10, 15.

<P>'Tis evident that God governed the <HI>Jews</HI> with re|gard to temporal Ble&s;&s;ings and temporal Cur&s;es, in the Way of a Covenant of Works. As to the external

and temporal State of their Per&s;ons, their Church, and their Nation, they were under a Covenant of Works; and God, who was their King or political Head, dealt with them from time to time in &s;aving them, or in puni&s;hing them according to their Works: And 'tis very ob&s;ervable, that 'tis this very Promi&s;e of <HI>Life,</HI> upon condition of <HI>doing the Works</HI> of the Law which the Apo&s;tle takes to de&s;cribe that <HI>Covenant of Works,</HI> by which the <HI>Jews</HI> could not be &s;aved as to their eternal State, &s;ee <HI>Rom.</HI> x. 3, 5. and ix. 31. <HI>The Man that doth them &s;hall live in them.</HI></P>
<P>If it be <HI>objected,</HI> that God allow'd of their Repentance for Sin in this his Law or Covenant as their King, and &s;ometimes he &s;aved the Nation upon their Re|pentance, and therefore it mu&s;t include the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> or <HI>Covenant of Grace;</HI> yet I an&s;wer, it may &s;till be called a <HI>Covenant of Works,</HI> becau&s;e a mere external vi&s;ible Humiliation and Reformation, without a real Peni|tence at Heart, was accepted by God as their King, as &s;ufficient to divert Divine Judgments from the Na|tion, and &s;ometimes from particular Per&s;ons, who had provoked God's Anger by external and vi&s;ible Iniquities. 1 Kings xxi. 2. <HI>See&s;t thou how Ahab humbleth him&s;elf? I will not bring this Evil in his Days</HI>; whereas all his Humiliation was his <HI>rending his Clothes, wearing of Sack|cloth and Fa&s;ting,</HI> and a little outward Appearance of Reformation, but 'tis evident that his Heart was not changed. See 1 <HI>King.</HI> xxii. 27.</P>
<P>It may be granted, indeed, there was much Grace and Mercy mingled in this Political Law or Covenant of Life, between <HI>God</HI> as a Civil King, and <HI>I&s;rael</HI> as his Subjects in this World; but &s;till this was not the Go&s;pel or Covenant of Grace and Salvation, whereby the pious <HI>Jews</HI> were &s;aved from the Wrath of God, as their &s;piritual Lord and Ruler in the other World, and whereby they had their Sins pardoned, and were

God unto Eternal Life, under the Old Te&s;tament: For there is nothing of this Doctrine of Repentance and Forgivene&s;s, nor of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> contained in the Ten Commands.</P>
<P>Let it be ob&s;erved al&s;o, that even in tho&s;e legal Pro|mi&s;es, which en&s;ure <HI>Life</HI> to tho&s;e who kept the Com|mands of God, there is a more &s;piritual and Evange|lical Sen&s;e &s;ometimes imply'd: For under this Word <HI>Life,</HI> and the&s;e temporal Ble&s;&s;ings which were pro|mi&s;ed, <HI>Eternal Life</HI> and eternal Ble&s;&s;ings were typify'd and held forth to tho&s;e that looked through the Veil, and that fulfilled the Will of God in &s;piritual and &s;incere Obedience, with an humble Sen&s;e of their Sins, and Tru&s;t in divine Forgivene&s;s. But the Ground of their Acceptance with God unto Eternal Life, or their Right to Heaven and Salvation, was not this their Perfor|mance of the Works of the Law; for their be&s;t Works were all imperfect, and <HI>they were &s;aved by Faith even as we.</HI> Gal. iii. 6 &mdash; 9. <HI>i. e.</HI> by tru&s;ting to pardoning Mercy, &s;o far as it was revealed under that Di&s;pen|&s;ation.</P>

<P>Thus it appears, that the bare keeping the Com|mandments of the Law was neither under the Old Te&s;tament nor the New, the Way to Salvation and Eternal Life for Sinners: But &s;ince <HI>the Law was weak,</HI> and unable to &s;ave, by rea&s;on of <HI>the weakne&s;s of our Fle&s;h</HI> or &s;inful Nature, <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 3. that is, &s;ince the Law promi&s;es Life only to tho&s;e who obey the Com|mands perfectly, and Men could not obtain Life this Way by rea&s;on of the Imperfection of their Obedience, there were many Calls to Repentance, and to tru&s;t in the Mercy of God, given to the <HI>Jews,</HI> in the Old Te&s;tament, as the pre&s;cribed Way for Sinners to obtain Salvation; which Duties, together with the Grounds of them, and the Ble&s;&s;ings promi&s;ed to them, are much more clearly revealed in the New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>I might confirm the&s;e An&s;wers to Dr. <HI>Whitby,</HI> out of his own Expo&s;ition on <HI>Rom.</HI> x. 9. <Q>Ju&s;tification (&s;aith he) is here expre&s;ly a&s;cribed to Faith; and that not as including Works, but only as being that Prin|ciple which, when it is cordial and &s;incere, will cer|tainly produce them: I &s;ay, <HI>not as including all tho&s;e Works</HI> which by the Go&s;pel are required to Sal|vation, for then the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Faith</HI> mu&s;t be de&s;cribed as the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Law (viz.</HI>) that <HI>the Man who doth the&s;e things &s;hall live in them,</HI> which is contrary to the Words of the Apo&s;tle, <HI>ver.</HI> 5, 6.</Q> So far does the Force of Truth, in &s;ome Places, con|&s;train hone&s;t Minds to admit and confe&s;s what in other Places they are very unwilling to allow, and which they almo&s;t contradict: But this mu&s;t be charged on the common or univer&s;al Influence of human Frailty and mi&s;taken Prejudices, and for want of an equal, uniform, &s;imultaneous and comprehen&s;ive View of all

<P><HI>Object.</HI> 4. There is another Objection which may be &s;tarted again&s;t my Expo&s;ition of this Text, that is drawn from Rev. ii. 2, 14. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are they that do his Commandments, that they may have right to the Tree of Life, and may enter through the Gates into the City,</HI> i. e. into Heaven, and enjoy Eternal Life. Surely, &s;ay &s;ome, the&s;e Words mu&s;t be acknowledged to be the Language of the Go&s;pel, or the Covenant of Grace, and not of the Law or the Covenant of Works: For they are the Words of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf, after his A&s;cen&s;ion to Heaven, and yet 'tis plain that doing the Com|mandments is here repre&s;ented as the Way to obtain Eternal Life in Heaven.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> But 'tis as plain that <HI>Doing the ten Command|ments of the moral Law,</HI> are not the only things that are meant here in this Text: But the&s;e Command|ments which <HI>give a right to the Tree of Life,</HI> &amp;c. in|clude at lea&s;t, if not chiefly de&s;ign, the peculiar Com|mands of God in the Go&s;pel, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Repentance for Sin, Faith in the pardoning Mercy of God through a Redeemer, which is productive of Love to God and Man. To prove this, read Matt. iv. 17. <HI>Repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand,</HI> Mark i. 15. <HI>Repent and believe the Go&s;pel,</HI> Mark xvi. 16. <HI>He that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI> John iii. 22, 23. <HI>And what&s;oever we ask we receive of him, becau&s;e we keep his Commandments, and do tho&s;e things that are plea&s;ing in his Sight: And this is his Commandment, that we &s;hould believe on the Name of his Son</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>and love one another as he gave us Commandment.</HI></P>
<P>Now as <HI>Adam</HI> by doing the peculiar Commands which God gave to him, might have obtained a Right to the Benefits of the literal <HI>Tree of Life</HI> in the Garden of <HI>Eden, (i. e.</HI> Immortality) So <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> by doing the
<PB N="101" REF="006440_0116_1028F035D0CA81F8">
peculiar Commandments of the Go&s;pel, may be &s;aid, in &s;ome Sen&s;e, to obtain <HI>a Right to the</HI> Benefits of the &s;piritual <HI>Tree of Life</HI> (i. e. <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI>) and may enter into Heaven: But a mere Obedience to the Com|mandments of the moral Law is never pre&s;cribed as the Way to obtain a Right to the Benefits of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> but rather an Obedience to the Commands of the Go&s;pel, which are peculiarly Repentance and Faith in <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>It may be yet further ob&s;erved, that the Commands to which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> directed the young Man in my Text, in order to <HI>enter into Life,</HI> were not <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance,</HI> but only the ten Commands of the moral Law: for he directs the young Man preci&s;ely to the Commands of the moral Law, and tells him, <HI>thou knowe&s;t what the&s;e Commands are.</HI> Now this young Man was &s;o full of his own Obedience to that Law, and &s;o confident of it, that he &s;eems not to know the Commands of <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of Sin and Repentance for it</HI>; much le&s;s did he think of the other Command of <HI>Faith in the Mercy of God through a Mediator.</HI> So that if it be never &s;o much allow'd, that Obedience to the&s;e humbling and &s;elf-aba&s;ing Commands of the Go&s;pel, <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance,</HI> may give a Right to the Benefits of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and to an En|trance into Heaven, yet an Obedience to the <HI>ten Com|mands of the moral Law</HI> could not make a Sinner's Way to Heaven and Eternal Life: But the&s;e ten Com|mands are tho&s;e which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> points out to the young <HI>Phari&s;aical</HI> Inquirer.</P>
<P>Upon the whole it appears, that when our Saviour &s;aith to the young Man in my Text, <HI>If thou wilt enter into Life keep the Commandments,</HI> he did not mean to give him the plain and direct Pre&s;cription of the Go&s;pel in order to the Salvation of a Sinner, but rather began with him in preaching the Law, in order to &s;hew him his Duty by the Law, and to convince him of Sin.</P>
<P>And from this View of things, I think we may draw
<PB N="102" REF="006440_0117_1028F037C1DE4D50">
this plain Ob&s;ervation (<HI>viz.</HI>) That where&s;oever the keeping the Commands of God is propo&s;ed to Men in Scripture as the Way to Life, it either means that the Way to obtain long temporal Life and temporal Ble&s;|&s;ings, was to ob&s;erve the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Laws, according to the political Covenant of God made with the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation at <HI>Sinai;</HI> or it means that perfect Obedience of Thought, Word, and Action to all the&s;e Com|mands which God gives us, is the Way to obtain Life Eternal by the Covenant of Works and Law of Inno|cency: Or if at any time the Context plainly deter|mines this Phra&s;e, <HI>keeping the Commandments,</HI> to &s;ignify the Way to obtain Salvation under the Go&s;pel, then the Word <HI>Commands</HI> mu&s;t extend to include the Evan|gelical Commands of <HI>Repentance for Sin,</HI> and <HI>Tru&s;t in the pardoning Mercy of God through a Mediator.</HI></P>
<P>And the Rea&s;on is plain; for this is the great Dif|ference always ob&s;erved between the Law and Go&s;pel, or between the Covenant of Works and the Covenant of Grace, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that the Covenant of Works or the Law, teaches us to claim Life as a Debt by our own exact Obedience to the Commands of the Law; but the Covenant of Grace or the Go&s;pel, teaches us hum|bly to &s;eek for Life or Salvation by Confe&s;&s;ion of Sin and Repentance, and by depending on the free Mercy of God, through a Mediator, for the Forgivene&s;s of Sin and Acceptance with God<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here I would caution my Readers to take notice, that I am not now debating that Point, <HI>In what manner the Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Atonement or Death of</HI> Chri&s;t <HI>is apply'd to us in order to our Intere&s;t in Forgivene&s;s of Sins, the Ju&s;tification of our Per&s;ons, or our Right to final Happine&s;s</HI>: That is an Argument of a different Con&s;ideration from the pre&s;ent De|bate.

<HEAD><HI>SECT. IV.</HI> Of what U&s;e is it to keep the Law then?</HEAD>
<P>Before I proceed I would an&s;wer another <HI>Objection</HI> or <HI>Query</HI> or two, upon this Subject, (<HI>viz.) Of what U&s;e is the Law of God in a Chri&s;tian Country? Or what U&s;e is there of keeping the Commandments of the moral Law, if we are not to obtain Eternal Life by them?</HI></P>
<P>Let the <HI>fir&s;t Enquiry</HI> be an&s;wered <HI>fir&s;t. Of what U&s;e is the Law of God in a Chri&s;tian Country, where the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t is preach'd?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> It is to be feared there are &s;everal thou&s;and Souls in a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Nation, who make a general Pro|fe&s;&s;ion of the Religion of the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and yet have no &s;erious Sen&s;e of the things of God and Reli|gion in their Hearts: And it is evident to daily Ob&s;ervation, that in a Land profe&s;&s;ing the Go&s;pel of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> there are Multitudes who have abandon'd all Piety even in the Form of it, as well as the Practice and Power thereof, and there are &s;ome who have lo&s;t even Morality it&s;elf; now the <HI>Law of God</HI> is needful to be maintain'd, and publi&s;h'd in &s;uch a Nation as this, to keep the &s;inful World in awe, and to pre&s;erve even wicked Men from running to all exce&s;s of Riot and Iniquity, by pre&s;&s;ing the Commands of God always upon their Con&s;ciences, and by &s;etting before them the Vengeance and Cur&s;es of the Law of God, which are due to Sinners, to pre&s;erve the World from univer&s;al Di&s;order and Wickedne&s;s. If there were no &s;uch Re|pre&s;entations of the Holine&s;s and Ju&s;tice of God in the World, what &s;hameful Impieties again&s;t God, and mo&s;t outragious Iniquities and Villanies would be &s;pread among the Children of Men: So that there would be no &s;uch thing as Peace, and Civility and Hone&s;ty to be found in &s;everal Places. The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> tells us, 1 Tim. i. 9, 10. <HI>Knowing this, that the Law is not made
<PB N="104" REF="006440_0119_1028DADADCB90700">
for a righteous Man, but for the Lawle&s;s and Di&s;obedient, for the Ungodly and for Sinners, for Unholy and Prophane, for Murderers of Fathers and Murderers of Mothers, for Man&s;layers, for Whoremongers, for them that defile them|&s;elves with Mankind, for Men&s;tealers, for Liars, for per|jured Per&s;ons, and if there be any other thing that is con|trary to &s;ound Doctrine.</HI></P>
<P>The holy Apo&s;tle acknowledges, where the Law of God is originally written in the Heart, and a Man is made righteous by a thorough Sanctification of all the Powers of Nature as it is in Heaven, there is no &s;uch need of the Commands, Threatnings, and Terrors of a penal Law, to keep Men in the practice of Obedi|ence; their own innocent or renewed Nature, their &s;incere and univer&s;al Love to God, and to his Law, will powerfully incline them to the Practice of Holine&s;s, without the Terrors and Puni&s;hments from the Hand of the ble&s;&s;ed God, being always kept before their Eyes.</P>
<P>It is true, there are &s;ome Ca&s;es wherein the Law of God may not be well known, even to good Men, or may be mi&s;taken by them, and there may be need of &s;pecial Commands to di&s;cover what is our Duty, and what is Sin: But where the Law is well known, the inward Power of univer&s;al Goodne&s;s in the Soul, with|out the&s;e outward Terrors, is made effectual to pre|&s;erve Holine&s;s and Obedience in the Life.</P>
<P>But perhaps you will then reply, <HI>Where there are true Chri&s;tians found, of what U&s;e is it for them to keep the Law of God?</HI> This is the <HI>&s;econd Enquiry,</HI> and to this I would give &s;everal particular <HI>An&s;wers,</HI> be&s;ides the fir&s;t and general one. In general I &s;ay then, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that there are &s;o many Re|mains of indwelling Sin in the be&s;t of Men, that Fears and Terrors of the Puni&s;hments of God, have their U&s;e in this imperfect State, to prevent the Soul from

warping a&s;ide to &s;inful Practices, under &s;trong and &s;pe|cial Temptations. Such frail and imperfect Creatures are we in this pre&s;ent State.</P>
<P>I proceed now to give &s;ome particular <HI>An&s;wers</HI> to this <HI>Que&s;tion, Of what U&s;e is it to keep the Law?</HI> and they are &s;uch as the&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1<HI>&s;t.</HI> Though we are not &s;aved from the Pu|ni&s;hment of Hell, nor pardoned and accepted to Eter|nal Life and Happine&s;s in Heaven, by virtue of our poor imperfect Obedience, and keeping the Commands of the moral Law, <HI>yet we can never be &s;aved without it</HI>: For our Love to the Law of God and a hearty Incli|nation to keep it, is a great Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the very Salva|tion which the Go&s;pel provides for &s;inful Men. <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> the Son of God is become our Saviour, not only <HI>to &s;ave us from God's Wrath,</HI> 1 The&s;. i. 10. but al&s;o to <HI>&s;ave us from our Sins.</HI> Matt. i. 21. and Tit. ii. 14. <HI>He gave him&s;elf for us that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purify to him&s;elf a peculiar People zealous of good Works.</HI> We mu&s;t be re&s;tored to the Image of God as well as to his Favour; now his Image is all Holine&s;s.</P>
<P>Mankind by the Fall have not only lo&s;t their Original State of Innocency and Happine&s;s, but their natural Powers are corrupted, the Mind, Will and Pa&s;&s;ions are perverted, and defiled, and turned away from God, and from their Duty to his Law. Now 'tis one great De&s;ign of the Go&s;pel to rectify the&s;e Di&s;orders in the Nature of Man: 'Tis one of the Promi&s;es of the Go&s;pel that <HI>the Law of God &s;hall be written in our Hearts,</HI> Heb. x. 16. and one of the great Offices and Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as a Saviour, is by all the Methods of his Grace and Power, to reduce our Hearts to the Love of God and his Law: <HI>He is made Sanctification to us</HI> as well as <HI>Redemption,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> i. 30. So that for Men to talk of being &s;aved without Love and Obedience to
<PB N="106" REF="006440_0121_1028F0436644D060">
the moral Law of God, is to talk plain Incon&s;i&s;tencies, or to affirm what natural Rea&s;on can never allow, and what Scripture and the Go&s;pel never de&s;igned; in &s;hort, 'tis to talk of being &s;aved without Salvation.</P>
<P>The moral Law of God is of Eternal Obligation upon Creatures: And it would be our con&s;tant Duty to obey it, even if we could &s;uppo&s;e there were no &s;uch future State, no &s;uch Eternal Life provided for Men as the Go&s;pel reveals. It ari&s;es from the Relation be|tween God and his Creatures. We can never be di&s;|ingaged or relea&s;ed from this Duty by the Go&s;pel, which brings in Pardon and Mercy to &s;ave us from the Puni&s;hment due <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o our Defects or Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of the Law; but not to relea&s;e us from Obedience to it.</P>
<P>A holy God will not &s;ave Sinners from Hell, and for|give them their Sins, without making them holy. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in all his abounding Love to Sinners, will not become <HI>a Mini&s;ter of Sin,</HI> Gal. ii. 17, 19, 20.

indeed this is one chief De&s;ign of God's appointing &s;uch a &s;olemn and publick Tran&s;action as the la&s;t Judg|ment, that all the Creation may &s;ee the Equity or Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of the Dealings of God with Men, that he awards the eternal Recompen&s;e to Saints and Sinners, according to their different Characters of Vice and Virtue, Sin and Holine&s;s. <HI>The Ve&s;&s;els of Wrath</HI> are by their own Rebellion and Impenitence <HI>fitted to De|&s;truction,</HI> and <HI>the Ve&s;&s;els of Mercy</HI> are by &s;anctifying Grace and Holine&s;s <HI>before prepar'd unto Glory,</HI> Rom. ix. 22, 23.</P>
<P>Though our own Works are by no means &s;ufficient to atone for Sin, or to procure the Favour of God or Eternal Life, for &s;uch guilty Creatures as we are, yet there is (as Dr. <HI>Owen,</HI> I think in his Book of Ju&s;tifica|tion, calls it) a <HI>rewardable Condecency</HI> in the Works of Holine&s;s, and there is many a Promi&s;e of heavenly Rewards made to them in the New Te&s;tament: Now when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hall adjudge the Wicked to Hell, and the Saints to Heaven, the whole Creation mu&s;t approve the Equity of his Dealings with Men.

<P>Thus we find there is abundant Rea&s;on for our Obedience to the Commands of the moral Law tho' it is not made the proper Condition, or pre&s;cribed Term of our Acceptance with God, and of obtaining Hap|pine&s;s by the Go&s;pel; for 'tis only perfect Obedience to the&s;e Commands in Thought, Word and Deed, can give us a Right to Eternal Life, according to the Law. And yet a &s;incere Endeavour after univer&s;al Obedience to them, is one nece&s;&s;ary Requi&s;ite of our being ap|proved by <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> at la&s;t, and our actual Entrance into Heaven, according to the Go&s;pel: Hereupon I am bold to affirm, that tho&s;e Per&s;ons whom all the&s;e Rea&s;ons

<P N="1">1. Reflection. <HI>It is a dangerous thing to mi&s;take the great De&s;ign of Chri&s;t's Mini&s;try here on Earth.</HI> Let us learn from this Di&s;cour&s;e, that our Saviour often preach|ed to Sinners the Go&s;pel of Grace and Forgivene&s;s, of Repentance and Faith in him&s;elf; yet that his chief Bu&s;ine&s;s here, was not to preach the Go&s;pel con|&s;tantly, nor to preach it in its full Light, Perfection and Glory; but rather to prepare the Way for it when he had laid the Foundation in his own Death and Re&s;urrection, and when his Kingdom &s;hould be &s;et up in the World in his Apo&s;tles, and by his Spirit, and built upon this Foundation. He prepared the Way for his Spirit, and his Apo&s;tles, even as <HI>John the Bapti&s;t</HI> prepared the Way for him.</P>
<P>The great Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in this Life on Earth, was to appear with the Characters of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> on him; to an&s;wer the Types and Prophe&s;ies that went before concerning him; to pa&s;s through the Stages of Life without Sin as our Example; to yield a perfect Obedience to the Law, and fulfil all tho&s;e Precepts in Perfection which we could never fulfil; to preach the Law in the Spirituality and Perfection of its Demands, and begin to open the Go&s;pel; to re&s;ign and &s;ubmit him&s;elf to Death, as a Sacrifice for Sin, accur&s;ed by
<PB N="112" REF="006440_0127_1028F054176FB1E0">
the Law, and devoted to the puni&s;hing Ju&s;tice of God: And hereby he laid a Foundation for clearer preach|ing the Go&s;pel of Forgivene&s;s of Sins through his Blood, which Doctrine he ju&s;t mentions to his Di&s;ciples at the la&s;t Supper.</P>
<P>As for his own publick Preaching, it chiefly con&s;i&s;ted in clear and full Explications of the Law of God in its Spirituality, which had been &s;hamefully ob&s;cured and curtailed by the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Doctors; in bringing the invi|&s;ible Worlds of Heaven and Hell into a nearer and brighter View; in vindicating his own Conduct again&s;t the Accu&s;ations of Men; in maintaining his own Cha|racter, as one &s;ent of God; in reproving the <HI>Jews</HI> for their corrupt Traditions, for their Hypocri&s;y, for their Self-Righteou&s;ne&s;s, for their Uncharitablene&s;s to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and thus calling the World to Conviction of Sin and Repentance, and preparing the Way by his Parables for the Reception of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> into the Church. When he preached the Go&s;pel of his Atone|ment for Sin and Faith in his Blood, it was rather in &s;ecret to his Di&s;ciples; or if in publick, 'twas gene|rally in dark Sayings and Parables, and my&s;tical Ex|pre&s;&s;ions, &s;uch as, <HI>The Son of Man being lifted up</HI> and <HI>drawing all Men to him, giving his Fle&s;h for Meat to the People, and his Blood for Drink,</HI> &amp;c. The plaine&s;t Intima|tions, which (I think) <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> ever gave of the Salva|tion of Sinners by his own Death as a Sacrifice, to People who were not his Di&s;ciples, was in tho&s;e meta|phorical Words two or three times repeated in the Tenth Chapter of <HI>John, I am the good Shepherd, who giveth his Life for the Sheep.</HI> But when his Death and Re&s;urrection had laid a fairer Foundation for the Go&s;pel, then he taught it his Di&s;ciples much more plainly after his Re&s;urrection, both by his Conver&s;ation and by his Spirit, and &s;ent them to publi&s;h it to the whole World more gloriou&s;ly than ever he him&s;elf
<PB N="113" REF="006440_0128_1028F055A12F7BC0">
taught it to the <HI>Jews.</HI> See this explain'd more at large in Dr. <HI>Watts</HI>'s &s;econd Sermon on <HI>the Atonement of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Now, I &s;ay, a Mi&s;take in the De&s;ign of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s pub|lick Preaching, may lead many People into &s;ome un|happy Mi&s;-apprehen&s;ions about &s;everal Things, and particularly about the Way of Salvation by the Go&s;|pel. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. When we hear <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> preach the Law &s;o much, and &s;peak of <HI>entering into Life by keeping the Command|ments,</HI> if we imagine all this to be the clear Go&s;pel, <HI>we &s;hall &s;eek to be &s;aved as it were by the Works of the Law,</HI> which the Apo&s;tle &s;o &s;everely reproves the <HI>Galatians</HI> for, and the <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Jewi&s;h Chri&s;tians,</HI> who dwelt among the <HI>Romans. Rom.</HI> ix. 31, 32. <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 1, &amp;c. and iv. 21. and v. 4. And if our Opinions and Conduct be the &s;ame, we &s;hall expo&s;e our&s;elves to the &s;ame &s;acred Re|proof of the Apo&s;tle, and be greatly bewildered in the Way to Heaven.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Such a Mi&s;take in the De&s;ign of Chri&s;t's preaching the Law,</HI> as though he taught it as the Way for the Salvation of Sinners, <HI>will incline us to expound the Law in &s;o gro&s;s and defective a Sen&s;e, as the Phari&s;ees did of old, that &s;o expounded, Sinners may be able to keep it, and obey the Commands of it &s;ufficient to gain Salvation thereby.</HI> It will tempt us to retrench and dimini&s;h the Perfection of its Demands of univer&s;al Holine&s;s in Thought, Word and Deed; becau&s;e otherwi&s;e we cannot yield a per|fect Obedience. Whereas it is much more glorious to God, the Governor of the World, to &s;uppo&s;e his holy Law &s;till maintains its own perfect Purity, and its ori|ginal Demands of con&s;tant univer&s;al Obedience; and 'tis more glorious to God our Saviour, to &s;uppo&s;e that he has provided an effectual Way for the Salvation of &s;inful Creatures, who tru&s;t in divine Mercy, and who
<PB N="114" REF="006440_0129_1028F05837350E80">
love the Law of God, though their be&s;t Obedience to it be very defective.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Such a Mi&s;take will lead Mini&s;ters to neglect the mention of the Death and Sufferings of Chri&s;t as a Sacrifice for Sin, and as the Foundation of our Pardon and our Hope;</HI> it will lead them to omit the&s;e important Points in their De&s;criptions of the Go&s;pel, and in their Ac|counts of Faith in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>; becau&s;e <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> never &s;poke &s;o publickly and plainly to the People, of making Atonement for Sin by his Death, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And upon this Account we &s;hall be in danger of leaving this Doc|trine out of our Directions of Sinners when they &s;eek the Way to Salvation, which is now made plainer and more nece&s;&s;ary &s;ince the Death and Re&s;urrection of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> are accompli&s;hed, &s;ince the Apo&s;tles have par|ticularly explain'd this Doctrine, and the New Te&s;tament is compleat.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>This Mi&s;take will tempt us to &s;et</HI> Chri&s;t <HI>and his Apo&s;tles at variance about the Way of Salvation. Chri&s;t</HI> &s;ays, <HI>If thou wilt enter into Life, keep the Commandments</HI>; and the Apo&s;tles &s;ay, <HI>The Law is the Mini&s;tration of Death,</HI> but <HI>believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and thou &s;halt be &s;aved</HI>; and <HI>we are ju&s;tified by Faith without the Works of the Law,</HI> &amp;c. And thus we &s;hall make the Holy Scripture contradict it&s;elf: Or if we endeavour to accommodate and reconcile the&s;e &s;eeming Oppo&s;i|tions, upon a Suppo&s;ition that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in the Language of my Text preached the Go&s;pel, it can never be done, with Fairne&s;s and Ju&s;tne&s;s of Thought, without &s;training the Words of Scripture from their natural Sen&s;e; and it will ever bring a Darkne&s;s upon the Di&s;|tinction between the Law and Go&s;pel, and leave the Way of Salvation by the Go&s;pel under much Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>This will tempt and incline us to expound the clear Go&s;pel, which we find in the Writings and Preaching of St. Paul,</HI> St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and St. <HI>John,</HI> after the Death and
<PB N="115" REF="006440_0130_1028F05ADB2B46C8">
Re&s;urrection of <HI>Chri&s;t, by one of the legal Expre&s;&s;ions of our Saviour,</HI> when in his own Life-time he preach'd the Law for the Conviction of Sinners: We &s;hall interpret the Words and Language of the Go&s;pel into the Sen&s;e of the Law of Works: We &s;hall almo&s;t explain away the Covenant of Grace, and make a Covenant of Works of it: And thus, perhaps, expo&s;e our&s;elves to the Danger of St. <HI>Paul's</HI> Cen&s;ure and <HI>Anathema,</HI> by <HI>preaching another Go&s;pel,</HI> or <HI>perverting the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t,</HI> Gal. i. 8.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>This Mi&s;take will lead us to &s;light and de&s;pi&s;e the Writings of the Apo&s;tles, as though they never did nor could preach the Go&s;pel &s;o clearly as Chri&s;t him&s;elf</HI>; whereas they were really de&s;ign'd and &s;ent forth after the Death and Re&s;urrection and A&s;cen&s;ion of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> to preach the full Go&s;pel to the Nations in clearer and &s;tronger Language than <HI>Je&s;us</HI> him&s;elf ever did to the Multitude; they were in&s;tructed and commi&s;&s;ioned to publi&s;h the Way to Salvation by <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> in a brighter and more explicite Manner and Expre&s;&s;ion, than his Divine Wi&s;dom thought proper to do before he had actually died and ro&s;e again, by which Tran&s;actions he laid the Foundation for preaching the Go&s;pel more clearly and perfectly.</P>
<P>A Mi&s;take about the per&s;onal Mini&s;try of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> in &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ages as this in my Text, will make us look upon the glorious and evangelical Paragraphs in the Sermons and the Epi&s;tles of <HI>Peter, Paul</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> as mere affectionate and fervent Pieces of Di&s;cour&s;e, ac|cording to the warm Temper and lively Fancies of tho&s;e hone&s;t and zealous Men, who in the Heat of their Spirits &s;poke many Things my&s;tically and unintelligibly. This hath been the profe&s;s'd Opinion of &s;ome who are called <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> concerning the great Apo&s;tle; and upon this Account they think none of his Writings are to be read without great Caution: But if you will

&s;eek the Way of Salvation aright (&s;ay they) you mu&s;t go to the Mount, and hear our Saviour's Sermon there, in the v. vi. and vii. Chapters of the Go&s;pel of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> while they neglect the more evangelical Speeches even of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf. This has been the Language of &s;ome Men, the Leaders of the Con&s;ci|ences of the ignorant Multitude, who are by Nature inclined enough to a Covenant of Works, and need not be taught and per&s;uaded to build all their Hopes of Heaven upon the Works of the Law, which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> never de&s;igned in that noble and admirable Sermon of his on the Mountain.</P>

<P><HI>How firm and durable is the ancient and perfect Law of God, which requires perfect, con&s;tant and per&s;evering Obedience?</HI> It is an eternal Law: It is not yet aboli&s;hed, though the Go&s;pel be introduc'd, nor &s;hall it be through all the Ages of Mankind, and the &s;everal Di&s;pen&s;ations of God toward Men. The moral Law is &s;ometimes &s;aid to be a Tran&s;cript or Copy from the Nature and Attributes of God; the Duties there required bear the more perfect Stamp and Sig|nature of his e&s;&s;ential Perfections, and therefore the Law mu&s;t be unchangeable.</P>

<PB N="119" REF="006440_0134_1028F06597885290">
corrupt Nature and fle&s;hly Inclinations render them unable to keep it perfectly; but, as I intimated be|fore, it is not weak in its own Nature to give Life. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in my Text preaches the Law, and &s;ays, <HI>If thou keep the Commandments. (i. e.</HI> with a per&s;evering Con|&s;tancy, and a &s;inle&s;s Perfection) <HI>thou &s;halt enter into Life:</HI> What <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;peaks is true. If any Man appear who hath been guilty of no Sin, and hath fulfilled the Law of God in every tittle of it in Thought, Word and Deed, he &s;hall have eternal Happine&s;s. Rom. ii. 7. <HI>They who &s;eek for Glory, Honour and Immortality, by patient continuance in well doing (en ergo agatho,</HI> in one good Work, without intermi&s;&s;ion or interruption by any Sin) <HI>they &s;hall have Eternal Life.</HI> This is the Language of the Law of Works. But our Incapacity to fulfil this Law in our fallen State, hath awaken'd the Compa&s;&s;ion of God to provide a Go&s;pel of Grace and Pardon, and to &s;end his Son <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> down from Heaven to Earth for this very Purpo&s;e, that humble, repenting, returning Sinners, who tru&s;t in the Mercy of God through a Mediator, might be &s;aved, even while they cannot fulfil the perfect Demands of his pure and holy Law, though they &s;incerely endeavour it.</P>
<P>The Great and Ble&s;&s;ed God maintains his holy Law &s;till in its own Perfection and Glory, though we have lo&s;t our practical or moral Power of obeying it per|fectly: I &s;ay, we have lo&s;t, by our Fall in <HI>Adam,</HI> our moral or practical Power of perfect Obedience to the Law; but our natural Powers of Under&s;tanding, Will and Affections remain, and there is no other na|tural Power or Faculty required, in order to obey it. And &s;ince our natural Powers remain, the Great God requires perfect Obedience of us, and all Men, to his holy Law, and yet he a&s;&s;ures us by his Go&s;pel, that he will not inflict the Cur&s;e of the Law on tho&s;e who heartily repent of their Sins, and tru&s;t in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> though
<PB N="120" REF="006440_0135_1028F0672664CFC8">
they do not or cannot yield perfect Obedience to this Law.</P>
<P>He doth not le&s;&s;en or dimini&s;h the Demands of his Law, which requires <HI>Perfection</HI> &s;till; for his Nature is too pure to require only an <HI>imperfect</HI> Obedience. If God under the Go&s;pel, had quite laid a&s;ide, or abo|li&s;hed his Law, and required or commanded no more than &s;uch a &s;incere imperfect Obedience, or &s;uch good Works which converted and pious Men perform, then they would fulfil the Requirements or Commands of God, and would have no Sin, and &s;uch Per&s;ons would need no Pardon. But this is contrary to the whole Tenor of the New Te&s;tament. <HI>If we &s;ay we have no Sin, we make God a Liar, we deceive our&s;elves, and the Truth is not in us,</HI> 1 John i. 10. The Law of God is Eternal, and demands perfect Obedience of every Crea|ture: But his Grace pardons tho&s;e who cannot come up to the perfect Demands of this Law, by rea&s;on of the moral Impotence contracted by the Fall, if they apply them&s;elves to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> his Son, according to the Rules of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>The Law therefore is Holy, and <HI>Ju&s;t,</HI> and Good, and will be &s;o to all Generations, <HI>Rom.</HI> vii. 12. and when our Saviour was beginning his divine and admi|rable Expo&s;ition of it on the Mount, he warns us in Matt. v. 17, 18. <HI>Think not I am come to de&s;troy the Law and the Prophets: I am not come to de&s;troy but to fulfil: for verily I &s;ay unto you, till Heaven and Earth pa&s;s, one jot or one tittle &s;hall in no wi&s;e pa&s;s from the Law till all be fulfilled</HI>; and our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> has put Honour upon his Father's Law &s;everal ways.</P>
<P N="1">1. He preached and explained it in the glorious Purity and Perfection of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. He fulfilled it all him&s;elf in mo&s;t exact Obedi|ence, and thereby &s;et all his Followers an admirable Example how to fulfil it.</P>

<P>Surely &s;ince I have a Soul of Immortal Duration, I'll &s;trive to have better Re&s;t and Support for it than this is, and never venture it here, &s;ince there is a &s;tronger and better Hope.

<P N="3">3. Forms of Religious Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P N="4">4. Outward Reformation with Vows and Labour after better Obedience.</P>
<P>Let us examine each of the&s;e briefly.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Penances and Mortifications, and our own Remor&s;e of Con&s;cience and Regret of Soul, together with many fancied Atonements for Sin:</HI> Thus the <HI>Heathens,</HI> ancient and modern. What Tortures have &s;ome of them inflicted on them&s;elves for the Expiation of their own Sins, or the Sins of their Country? So great and powerful hath been their Sen&s;e of the Guilt of Sin, that large Sacrifices, and dreadful ones too, have been propo&s;ed by &s;ome of them for this Purpo&s;e, <HI>Micah.</HI> vi. 6, 7. <HI>Thou&s;ands of Rams, and ten thou&s;and Rivers of Oil,</HI> and &s;ome of them have actually offered their <HI>Fir&s;t-born for their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, the Fruit of their Body for the Sin of their Souls.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Gentiles,</HI> when they are a little con&s;iderate, one would think, mu&s;t acknowledge God to be the Governor of the World, and that he is a great and dreadful God, who has, in very vi&s;ible In&s;tances, &s;ome|times manife&s;ted his Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t the Sins of Men, and <HI>revealed his Wrath from Heaven again&s;t their Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s and Ungodline&s;s:</HI> And under the Fear and Terror of his Vengeance they have &s;ometimes put on Sackcloth and lived in A&s;hes: They have deny'd them&s;elves the common Food of Nature, and half fami&s;hed their Bodies with Ab&s;tinence. So the <HI>Nine|vites</HI> did at the Threatning of the Lord by <HI>Jonah</HI> the Prophet. Sometimes they have bani&s;h'd them&s;elves from Towns and Cities, and all Conver&s;e with Men, into meer De&s;arts and Caves of the Earth, and &s;train'd their Limbs in painful Po&s;tures, for Years together, to
<PB N="141" REF="006440_0156_1028F09F49B438F0">
make Atonement for the Sins of the People; &s;o &s;ome of the pretended Saints in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> have done. They have put them&s;elves in Iron Cages, with &s;harp Spikes, to be carried about and wounded from Head to Foot, as &s;ome of the <HI>Bonzes</HI> in <HI>China;</HI> they have thrown them&s;elves under a heavy loaden Chariot of their huge Images and Idols, and been cru&s;hed to Death, as &s;ome of their holy Men in <HI>Malabar.</HI> But what hath all this avail'd to obtain the Favour of that God whom they have offended? Who hath required this at their Hands? And what Ground have they to think God will accept it?</P>
<P>So al&s;o tho&s;e of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, who are fallen from the Doctrine that St. <HI>Paul</HI> once wrote to the <HI>Romans,</HI> have invented various Penances, and endea|vour'd to come into the Favour of God by them: As though la&s;hing them&s;elves with Cords, could &s;atisfy infinite Ju&s;tice for their Crimes, and wearing Sackcloth on their Fle&s;h could make their polluted Souls pure and acceptable to God. In following Ages when the Prie&s;ts were grown more crafty and covetous, they taught them to come to God by Money, and to buy Pardons for Sin and Titles to Heaven of the Pope. This was called a <HI>Commutation of Penance,</HI> and making their Pur&s;e &s;uffer in&s;tead of their Fle&s;h; and thus they compounded with the Ju&s;tice of God for the Sins of their Souls. They lavi&s;h away much Silver and Gold, to make Atonement before God for breaking his Law. Poor Attempts and hopele&s;s Pretences, to remove the Di&s;plea&s;ure of a God, and make a Way for their favourable Acce&s;s to him! There have been &s;ome au&s;tere Per&s;ons that have &s;eparated them&s;elves from the lawful Cu&s;toms of the World, and common Com|forts of Life, in order to appea&s;e their Con&s;ciences for pa&s;t Indulgence and Sen&s;uality, as though God and his Holine&s;s, and his governing Wi&s;dom and Maje&s;ty,
<PB N="142" REF="006440_0157_1028F0A0D45F5CD0">
would be as ea&s;ily &s;atisfy'd as their blinded Con&s;ci|ences.</P>
<P>Others again after Sin are terrify'd with Fears of Death and De&s;truction; and under the&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions they &s;eem to mourn for their Sins, and then fly to their Repentances and Tears to &s;ave them; though perhaps their Repentance and Regret of Con&s;cience carries no more Hatred of Sin in it than <HI>Judas</HI> had who hang'd him&s;elf for inward Vexation and Angui&s;h of Soul.</P>
<P>But if this Repentance were never &s;o &s;incere, is the great God obliged to pardon &s;uch repeated Crimes and Iniquities as ours are, merely becau&s;e the Criminal re|pents? Do the Princes of the Earth think it nece&s;&s;ary to forgive every Rebel and Traytor, becau&s;e he is &s;orry he has been guilty of Trea&s;on and expo&s;ed him|&s;elf to Puni&s;hment? Why then &s;hould the King of Kings be bound to let every Criminal pa&s;s without being puni&s;hed, merely becau&s;e he repents of his Wickedne&s;s? It will be &s;aid perhaps, we have nothing better to offer than our Repentance. And what then? Mu&s;t a poor Rebel be always pardon'd becau&s;e he has nothing to make Satisfaction to his injured Sovereign, be&s;ides his own Tears? And yet there are too many who &s;till will hope that their Sins are wa&s;hed away, and their Guilt atoned for, by their Sorrows and Re|pentances; and &s;ome Chri&s;tian Divines have expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves a little too gro&s;sly and unwarily on this Point.</P>
<P>O let us have a Care of &s;uch Mi&s;takes, and ble&s;s the Lord, that he hath taught us a better Laver than our own Tears, a more powerful Atonement than any of our Sorrows or Terrors. The Pollutions of the Soul by Sin require a better clean&s;ing, and Affronts to the Maje&s;ty of Heaven demand a higher Satisfaction or
<PB N="143" REF="006440_0158_1028F0A413EFC280">
Recompence, than any that we can make with our utmo&s;t Efforts of this kind.</P>
<P N="2">2. Others fly to <HI>Works of Charity to the Poor,</HI> or of <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed Piety towards God, performed either in Life or at Death.</HI> Hence ari&s;e &s;ome extraordinary Appearances of Liberality in the World: This Hope of making &s;ome Compen&s;ation for Sin, lays the Foundation of Churches and Ho&s;pitals: And magnificent Structures ari&s;e upon the Earth to gain the Favour of the God of Heaven, who hath been provoked by former Iniqui|ties. Whole E&s;tates are &s;ometimes given away by old Sinners, and alienated from their natural Heirs and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, even from needy Friends and Kindred, and are devoted to religious and charitable U&s;es, in order to purcha&s;e Salvation for their Souls.</P>
<P>If they are <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> indeed, we can hardly &s;up|po&s;e they have the&s;e actual Rea&s;onings within them|&s;elves, as to infer, that God will be &s;o much plea&s;ed with the&s;e Legacies, as to pardon their Sins for the &s;ake of &s;uch a Liberality to the Church or the Poor; this is the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Doctrine of <HI>Merit,</HI> which as <HI>Prote&s;|tants</HI> we all renounce. But &s;till there is a &s;ecret work|ing of this Self-Righteou&s;ne&s;s in the Hearts of Multi|tudes: And when upon a Death-bed they bequeath large Legacies to the Service of God, or the Relief of the Poor, they hope to breathe out their Spirit com|fortably into the Hand of God the Father, with &s;ome Dependance on the&s;e Legacies, at lea&s;t as &s;ufficient Evidences of their Love to God, and with confident Expectations of obtaining his Salvation.</P>
<P>But alas! what can a little Charity to the Poor do toward the Reconciliation of a God to an offending Creature. Is there any Force in this Rea&s;oning, be|cau&s;e I do a Kindne&s;s for a Fellow-Worm, therefore my Maker mu&s;t love me, and forgive me all Affronts again&s;t him? Or becau&s;e I have given to the Ser|vice
<PB N="144" REF="006440_0159_1028F0A90FC016D8">
of God, &s;ome of tho&s;e worldly good things which he fir&s;t be&s;tow'd upon me, therefore he mu&s;t pardon all my former Iniquities, he mu&s;t receive me for ever into his Favour, and confer upon me the Riches of Glory and the Inheritance of the Saints in Light? How weak and ignorant are the&s;e Rea&s;onings? And yet how many have been ready to lay the Stre&s;s of their Hopes upon them, having nothing el&s;e within their View to tru&s;t in?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Forms and Ob&s;ervances of religious Wor&s;hip,</HI> are another vain Pillar upon which Sinners lean and &s;up|port them&s;elves. This is a mo&s;t common and power|ful Deceit. How many thou&s;ands are there, that by daily Attendance upon Solemnities of Wor&s;hip and coming up to the Hou&s;e of God, hope at la&s;t to come to the Arms of the Father with Acceptance? And e&s;pecially if they have practi&s;ed &s;ecret Devotion too, in the common Rounds and Forms of it, and have fre|quently bow'd their Knees to God in their Retire|ments, their Hope has ri&s;en high; and though they have not arrived at a thorough change of Heart, and &s;incere Love to God, yet they will pre&s;ume upon his Acceptance without any great Concern about the Sal|vation of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>But let me ask &s;uch &s;ort of Candidates for Heaven and Happine&s;s, whether a formal Round of Duties and Services, without the Heart and Soul in them, without &s;incere Love to God and Delight in him, can &s;o far plea&s;e the ble&s;&s;ed God, as to per&s;wade him to neg|lect all the righteous Demands of his governing Ju&s;|tice for pa&s;t Crimes? Or if your Hearts are &s;ometimes engaged in the&s;e Solemnities, is this &s;ufficient to cancel all former Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if you have no Mediator, who &s;hall intro|duce &s;uch a Sinner, or his Duties, into the Pre&s;ence of God with Acceptance? May he not ju&s;tly drive
<PB N="145" REF="006440_0160_1028F0AA9B13CB10">
us with all our &s;olemn Formalities, afar from his Seat, &s;ince we neglect the only Hope &s;et before us, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Name of his Son, without which no Man &s;hall come to be accepted of the Father. John xiv. 6. <HI>No Man cometh to the Father but by me.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The la&s;t thing I mention, on which &s;ome Per&s;ons are prone to depend, in order to obtain divine Favour and Forgivene&s;s, is a <HI>Cour&s;e of outward Refor|mation, and &s;ome Vows and &s;ome Endeavours after better Obedience:</HI> But I would endeavour in the&s;e few Parti|culars, to di&s;cover the Vanity of all Hopes of this kind.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) Our Duties of Obedience are very imperfect: They do not in any Degree an&s;wer the &s;trict Demands of the Law and Ju&s;tice of God; and the be&s;t of them are &s;o defective that they can never claim or pretend to any Merit in them, &s;ince they do not come up to an&s;wer the Requirements of God in his general Rule of Government.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Our Obedience of to day cannot wipe away or cancel the Crimes of ye&s;terday or our pa&s;t Life: The&s;e Crimes &s;tand like high and unpa&s;&s;able Mountains in the way betwixt God and us: Paying a new Debt never wipes off old Scores among Men, and why &s;hould we imagine it will do &s;o before the Throne of God?</P>
<P N="3">(3.) Were our Duties perfect, yet 'tis not only a guilty, but a worthle&s;s Creature, a mere polluted Worm performs them; and the eternal Favour of an offended God is not to be purcha&s;ed for Rebels at &s;o cheap a rate.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) It is true, 'tis by Duties of Wor&s;hip we mu&s;t draw near unto God, and by the Acts of our Mind and Will, by Knowledge, A&s;&s;ent, Faith, Tru&s;t, Hope, Prayer and Repentance, we mu&s;t come to God; but 'tis &s;till by and through the Mediation and Intere&s;t
<PB N="146" REF="006440_0161_1028F0AD124F0AD0">
of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> the Son, that the&s;e Acts of the Soul mu&s;t be addre&s;s'd to the Father. The&s;e con&s;ider'd alone in them&s;elves, are not pre&s;cribed in my Text as the Way it&s;elf, for <HI>Chri&s;t is the Way, the Truth and the Life:</HI> He is the only true and living Way to God: The&s;e Actions perform'd with a due regard to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> are properly our walking in the way which God hath ap|pointed; but if we have no regard to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in the&s;e Actions, we are not walking in God's Way, nor can we rai&s;e any &s;olid Hope that we &s;hall arrive at his gracious Pre&s;ence, while we neglect or refu&s;e the only Way which God has ordained.</P>
<P>Perhaps &s;ome more intelligent or more conceited Hearers, may cry out here, why are the&s;e Rudiments and plain Principles of Chri&s;tianity preached to us? Surely we know better, and under&s;tand more of the Go&s;pel of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> than to make &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;es nece&s;|&s;ary for us to attend them.</P>
<P>I <HI>an&s;wer,</HI> 1. However learned &s;ome may be in the&s;e Truths, yet perhaps there may be others coming con|tinually into our A&s;&s;emblies, who know little enough either of the Law or Go&s;pel; and they had need of the Doctrines of their own Guilt, and Mi&s;ery, and Danger, to be &s;poken in very plain and clear Language to them, before they will hearken and &s;tand &s;till, and con&s;ider their own Circum&s;tances, and their Peril: And the Nature of Man when under the Awakenings of Con&s;cience, is &s;o prone to take hold of every fal&s;e and feeb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Refuge, and to venture their Eternal Hopes upon them, that it is very nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak the&s;e things often, and to repre&s;ent them in the cleare&s;t Light, in order to caution Sinners again&s;t building their Hopes on the Sand, and re&s;ting all their Expectation of the Favour of God and Happine&s;s, upon &s;ome feeble Foundation which will not bear them. 'Tis not the Wi&s;e and the Learned that I pretend to in&s;truct; but

it is pity any poor Soul, even of the lowe&s;t Ranks of Mankind, &s;hould abide ignorant of the&s;e important Concerns, and &s;hould peri&s;h in &s;uch a Land of Light, and for want of <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Knowledge.</P>

Some pious Souls have complain'd of this Temptation, and corrupt Nature is very ready in the be&s;t of <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> to build up &s;ome Parts of their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s as their &s;ufficient Refuge, and &s;ometimes to put it in place of the perfect Mediation and Atonement of the Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 3. However the Ca&s;e be now with us, and if we have truly got the Victory over all Temptations of this Kind, yet it is very proper to remember what once we were, and reflect upon what fal&s;e Hopes we once were ready to build on, and to ble&s;s the Holy Spirit of Light and Grace, that hath di&s;cover'd our Mi&s;takes unto us, that has turned our Feet from every dangerous Hope, and led us to the Father by the true and living way <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>Let this Thought al&s;o call us to mourn over the Souls of Men, even the greate&s;t Part of our Fellow Creatures, Inhabitants of this World, who are made of the &s;ame Fle&s;h and Blood as we are, and who, through gro&s;s Ignorance, are ever practi&s;ing &s;ome fooli&s;h Methods of pacifying God for pa&s;t Sins, and aiming at his Favour and Happine&s;s in &s;uch Ways as will never attain their End. O Come, Lord <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and &s;pread thy Light and thy Truth through the dark Nations, and &s;catter all the remaining Mi&s;ts and Dark|ne&s;&s;es that lie upon Countries which have only the Name of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and &s;ome of the Forms of his Religion

<P>The next <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> will &s;hew us a plain and ea&s;y Account of <HI>Faith in Chri&s;t,</HI> or <HI>of coming to God by Chri&s;t:</HI> I acknowledge, I have been &s;ometimes unea&s;y and a&s;hamed to hear a Divine of the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Church tell his People, that <HI>Faith in Chri&s;t</HI> is a my&s;terious Thing, and it is not to be well known, or clearly conceived in it&s;elf, but it may be much <HI>better conceived by its Effects, therefore,</HI> &s;aith he, I pro|ceed, in&s;tead of &s;peaking of <HI>Faith it&s;elf,</HI> to give you an Account of the <HI>Fruits</HI> and <HI>Effects</HI> of it.</P>
<P>As though there was any thing in the Affairs of human Life, in Rea&s;on, or in Religion, clearer than this Notion, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Upon a Sight and Sen&s;e of our Sins and Dangers, and our Weakne&s;s to help our|&s;elves, to commit our&s;elves into the Hands of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> by an humble Act of Tru&s;t or Dependance on him, complying with his appointed Methods of Relief in the Go&s;pel.</P>

<P>INNOCENT Man in the Day of his Creation had a Liberty of drawing near to God his Maker, and of de|lightful Conver&s;e with him in a more immediate man|ner; but Man having fallen from God, and becoming guilty in his Per&s;on, and &s;inful in his Nature, dwells in this World afar off from God; and yet &s;ometimes would attempt to approach him, and obtain his Favour again merely by his own Powers and Performances; as though the Goodne&s;s of God would receive him again into his Pre&s;ence, and into his Love in the &s;ame manner as before. Sinful Mankind have been often trying to make their way to God in and of them&s;elves: Thence ari&s;e tho&s;e various <HI>mistaken Grounds of Hope,</HI> of which we have given an Account in the former Di&s;cour&s;e: But the Ble&s;&s;ed God has &s;ufficiently informed us in the Word of his Go&s;pel, that it is in vain for us to hope to draw near to God, our offended Sovereign, without a Mediator; and there is <HI>but one Mediator</HI> of God's Appointment <HI>between God and Man,</HI> and that is <HI>the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI>

1 Tim. ii. 5. and <HI>No Man cometh to the Father but by him,</HI> John xiv. 6.</P>
<P>Now in order to explain <HI>what it is for Sinners to come to God the Father by Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> let us con&s;ider that all &s;aving Approaches of the Creature unto God, depend on God's Approaches to the Creature: He fir&s;t draws us by his Grace, and then we follow. Jer. xxxi. 3. <HI>I have loved thee with an everla&s;ting Love, therefore with Lovingkindne&s;s have I drawn thee.</HI> 1 John iv. 19. <HI>If we love him it is becau&s;e he loved us fir&s;t.</HI> If our Souls are &s;et a moving towards him, it is becau&s;e his Heart, his Pity and his Love moved fir&s;t towards us.</P>
<P>In the Reconciliation of God and his &s;inful Creatures, there mu&s;t be a mutual Approach, and a mutual Near|ne&s;s; but it mu&s;t be remember'd, that the Sinners coming nigh to God, is but an Eccho or An&s;wer to the merciful Voice of God coming nigh to him: And the &s;ame Method in which we may &s;uppo&s;e the great God to draw near to Sinners, the &s;ame Steps &s;hould we take in drawing near to God.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be granted, indeed, that all the Acts of God are eternal, and his Decrees have no Order of Succe&s;|&s;ion as they are in him: The eternal Mind con|ceives the Ends and Beginnings of all things at once; but there are many Expre&s;&s;ions in Scripture which con|de&s;cend to our Frailty, and teach us to conceive of the infinite and eternal Things of God by way of Time and Succe&s;&s;ion, that we may obtain a fuller and clearer Under&s;tanding of them; for no created Mind is ca|pacious enough to gra&s;p all the divine Decrees in one &s;ingle Thought, as that God does who formed them.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be ob&s;erved al&s;o, that though the Actions of the Soul of Man are generally produced in a &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive Way, yet &s;ometimes two or three of the&s;e Acts are &s;o &s;wift in their Succe&s;&s;ion, and &s;o nearly &s;imulta|neous,

or at the &s;ame Moment that they are blended together, or are &s;o interwoven in many Ca&s;es, that it is hard to &s;ay, which is fir&s;t, and which is la&s;t: And many times al&s;o, in one and the &s;ame Act of the Soul, there are &s;uch different Views and De&s;igns concurring, as may make it look like two or three di&s;tinct Actions: So <HI>returning to God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> includes in it both <HI>Re|pentance,</HI> with all the Acts contained therein, as well as <HI>Faith,</HI> with all its &s;ubordinate Motions: It is <HI>Re|pentance</HI> as it is a Return to God; it is <HI>Faith</HI> as <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is the Medium of this Return.

<P>Let us then here take a Survey of tho&s;e <HI>&s;everal Steps, whereby God may be &s;uppo&s;ed to draw near to fallen Man, in order to his Recovery,</HI> and thereby we &s;hall learn <HI>what corre&s;pondent Steps Sinners mu&s;t take, in order to their coming to God.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The Ble&s;&s;ed God &s;urveying his lower Creation, beheld all Mankind as Creatures in general <HI>fallen from his Image and his Love,</HI> and at a wide and dreadful Di&s;|tance from their Creator.

<P>Now in corre&s;pondence with this View, which God has taken of the Children of Men, in their Guilt and Mi&s;ery in general; we al&s;o, in order to our Reco|very, mu&s;t be brought to &s;ee our&s;elves <HI>guilty and mi&s;e|rable,</HI> we mu&s;t &s;ee our&s;elves de&s;titute of the Image and the Love of <HI>God</HI> in our fallen State of Nature, if ever we would return to him by <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and Grace.</P>
<P>God, who is e&s;&s;entially happy in being for ever near him&s;elf, and one with him&s;elf, has made the Happine&s;s of his Creatures to depend on their being near to him, and their Union with him; and he knows it is Mi&s;ery enough to be afar off from God: So mu&s;t we be made deeply &s;en&s;ible of our Wretchedne&s;s and Mi&s;ery in the Lo&s;s of the Favour and Image of God, and in our dreadful State of Di&s;tance and E&s;tranged|ne&s;s from him.

We mu&s;t &s;ee it &s;o as to feel it, and be affected with it at our Heart; we mu&s;t have &s;uch an Impre&s;&s;ion of it made upon our Souls, &s;o as never to be &s;atisfied to continue in &s;uch a State, and be re&s;tle&s;s in &s;eeking &s;ome way of Reco|very, as I &s;hall &s;hew more particularly afterwards.</P>
<P N="2">2. The great God &s;urveying his own glorious Per|fections in him&s;elf, and the ju&s;t Rights of his Govern|ment, taking a View al&s;o of the Holine&s;s, Ju&s;tice and Wi&s;dom of his Law, which &s;inful Man had grievou&s;ly di&s;honoured and affronted by Di&s;obedience; he did not think it proper for him&s;elf as the Supreme Governor

It became the great God to make his Law appear wi&s;e and ju&s;t, by demand|ing &s;uch a Reparation of the Di&s;honour done to it.</P>
<P>But he found <HI>all Mankind utterly uncapable of making any &s;uch Recompence,</HI> &s;ince all that they could do for time to come was but their known Duty to their Creator, and none of their Sufferings &s;hort of De&s;truc|tion and eternal Death could make Atonement or Sa|tisfaction for the Sins that were pa&s;t: And in this View of things the great God did, as it were, pro|nounce the Recovery of his Creature Man, by all his own Powers and Capacities, altogether hopele&s;s, and that his Recovery mu&s;t ari&s;e only from divine Grace.</P>
<P>In corre&s;pondence to this View of Things in the Eye of God, we &s;hould al&s;o &s;et before our own Eyes the Holine&s;s, Ju&s;tice and Wi&s;dom of the Law of our Creator, in order to make our&s;elves deeply &s;en&s;ible of our great Guilt, in breaking his Law, and our <HI>De&s;ert of Death</HI> by the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of it: We &s;hould al&s;o be made &s;en&s;ible in &s;ome mea&s;ure of the <HI>Right of his divine Authority and Government to demand &s;ome Satis|faction for our Offences,</HI> before we be received into his Favour again. The very Workings of natural Con|&s;cience under a Sen&s;e of Guilt, &s;eem to be an Im|pre&s;&s;ion from the God of Nature on the Mind of Man, that Sin de&s;erves Puni&s;hment, becau&s;e the Law of a God broken, requires &s;ome Reparation of Honour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is so univer&s;al in all Ages among the con&s;iderate Part of Mankind, that the <HI>Heathens</HI> them&s;elves, in their own Circum&s;tances, tho't a <HI>Neme&s;is</HI> or vindictive Indignation of God would attend on Sin|ners. <HI>Acts</HI> xxviii. 4.

<P>In the &s;ame manner, in order to our Recovery, we mu&s;t look upon our&s;elves in our fallen State, as <HI>unfit for Corre&s;pondence with God,</HI> uncapable of enjoying Hap|pine&s;s in his Pre&s;ence, by rea&s;on of the Oppo&s;ition of our Will to his Holine&s;s, and to our Duty, we mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of the great Carnality of our Affec|tions cleaving to earthly Things, and to the tempting Vanities of this Life, chu&s;ing them for our Portion and our Happine&s;s in&s;tead of God.</P>
<P>And we mu&s;t be acquainted al&s;o <HI>how weak and feeble all our Own Efforts are to work this mighty and univer&s;al change of Nature in us,</HI> to form our Spirits anew, and to rectify all the Moral Di&s;orders in them: We mu&s;t be made &s;en&s;ible how uncapable we are of giving our Souls a new Bent and Bia&s;s toward things divine and heavenly, in&s;tead of that &s;inful Propen&s;ity which works in our Natures, and is ever leading us a&s;tray from God and true Happine&s;s; &s;o that if ever we are recovered, we mu&s;t depend entirely upon the free Grace and Mercy of God for our whole Recovery; not only to provide a Satisfaction for his own injur'd Law and Authority, but al&s;o to take away the Perver&s;ene&s;s and Ob&s;tinacy of our Wills, and to change our vile Affec|tions into holy and heavenly.</P>
<P>This is that Poverty of Spirit, that Sen&s;ibility of our own helple&s;s State, which is the fir&s;t Foundation of the Kingdom of God within us. So our Saviour teaches, Matt. v. 3. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the poor in Spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of God.</HI> This is that Humility of Soul which the Men of <HI>Laodicea</HI> wanted, <HI>Rev.</HI> iii. 17.

<P N="4">4.

<P>In corre&s;pondence with this gracious De&s;ign and De|termination of the ble&s;&s;ed God, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary that we al&s;o &s;hould <HI>have &s;ome Hope and Belief of God's Willing|ne&s;s to be reconciled,</HI> or that there is Grace and Com|pa&s;&s;ion with him for returning Sinners.

(3) To &s;ecure the Sal|vation of Man more effectually, uniting all the &s;aved Number in one unfailing and all-&s;ufficient Head: And therefore his own Son was cho&s;en for this Office, as being able to undertake all that was nece&s;&s;ary completely to bring back Man to God.</NOTE>. This was intimated in God's earlie&s;t Revelations of his Grace, when he &s;pake of the <HI>Seed of the Woman,</HI> which &s;hould <HI>break the Head of the Serpent,</HI> and de&s;troy the De&s;igns of the Tempter to ruin Mankind: But under the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation it is much more abundantly manife&s;ted: And finding no other Per&s;on &s;ufficient for this Work, God cho&s;e his own Son to become a Mediator between God and Man; even that Son of his Love, who was <HI>one with the Father,</HI> and <HI>lay in his Bo&s;om</HI> and <HI>had Glory with him</HI> there, <HI>before the Foundation of the World,</HI> that Son in <HI>whom dwelt all the

Fulne&s;s of the Godhead,</HI> even that Son <HI>by whom he created</HI> the World and Mankind at fir&s;t; it was by him, as a Mediator, that he de&s;ign'd to recover Man from his Ruins, his Guilt and his Wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>This was the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> whom God promi&s;ed to <HI>Abra|ham,</HI> who &s;hould be one of his Po&s;terity, and <HI>in whom all the Nations of the Earth &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> This was be whom God &s;poke of, and recommended by many of the Prophets, and de&s;cribed under &s;everal Types and Figures in ancient Ages, that when he came he might be better known and accepted by the World.

This is the one and <HI>only Mediator between God and Man, even the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> who was al&s;o one with God.</P>
<P>For this End it plea&s;ed the Father to furni&s;h him with every nece&s;&s;ary Talent and Qualification: He anointed him with <HI>his Holy Spirit</HI> to dwell in him <HI>without Mea&s;ure</HI>; he appointed him to be born of a Woman in low Circum&s;tances of Life, and to grow up through all the Stages of Infancy, Childhood, and Youth, to the Manly Age of Thirty; then he called and commi&s;|&s;ioned him to be a publick Prophet and Teacher of the Go&s;pel, or the Way of Salvation: He &s;et him up al&s;o for an Example of Humility and Love towards God and Man, and of Holine&s;s, Submi&s;&s;ion and Patience, and univer&s;al Obedience thro' the Cour&s;e of his Life, and then appointed him to die as an atoneing Sacrifice for the Sins of Men: <HI>God laid our Sins upon him,</HI> and <HI>&s;et him forth,</HI> or fore-determin'd him <HI>to be a Propitiation for Sin through Faith</HI> or Tru&s;t <HI>in his Blood.</HI></P>
<P>This is he whom <HI>God rai&s;ed from the Dead and exalted him at his right Hand,</HI> to be an Interce&s;&s;or for &s;inful Man there, in the Virtue of his Sacrifice, and to be

the Head of vital Influence to Men, to work <HI>Repentance</HI> and Holine&s;s in their Hearts, as well as to be a <HI>Prince,</HI> or <HI>Lord and Saviour, to be&s;tow Forgivene&s;s of Sins.</HI></P>
<P>God gave him al&s;o Power to Rule and Govern all things for the Good of his People, and ordained him to be Judge of the World at the great Day.

<P>Now in Corre&s;pondence with the&s;e Coun&s;els of God the Father, in order to bring fallen Man near to him|&s;elf, Sinners mu&s;t believe the Truth and Certainty of God's Appointment, that they &s;hall not come to him again without a Mediator; and they mu&s;t have a cer|tain and well-&s;ettled Per&s;wa&s;ion of this Divine Con&s;ti|tution.</P>
<P>It is granted that there have been &s;ome &s;uch Thoughts among Mankind, in all Ages: They have had &s;ome Notion of coming to God by a Mediator, from an awful Sen&s;e of the Maje&s;ty and Holine&s;s of God, and of their own Vilene&s;s and Unworthine&s;s, and their De&s;ert of his Di&s;plea&s;ure becau&s;e of Sin.

<P>So again the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> at mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> when they &s;aw God in his terrible Appearances of Thunder and Lightning, and a Voice came from the Fire, they &s;aid, <HI>Let not God &s;peak to us le&s;t we die, but let</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>&s;peak

<P>The <HI>Heathens</HI> had their lower Deities who were &s;up|po&s;ed, even by the Philo&s;ophers, to be Mediators between them and the &s;upreme God.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, God tran&s;acts his great Affairs with Man|kind, oftentimes according to the Language, Cu&s;toms, and Manners of Men. Now 'tis the natural and com|mon way of Offenders, again&s;t a Superior, to get &s;ome Mediator to &s;peak for them, and bring them into Favour again.</P>
<P>Mankind al&s;o, in order to this Reconciliation, mu&s;t have &s;ome Knowledge of this Mediator: They mu&s;t be <HI>acquainted with the mo&s;t important Articles which God has revealed concerning this great Mediator Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>We are called to behold him and to &s;urvey him in the Glory of his Per&s;onal Excellencies, in his original Fitne&s;s for this Work of a Reconciler, and in the &s;everal Offices which God has commi&s;&s;ioned him to &s;u&s;tain, as ju&s;t before de&s;cribed.

and Death<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though it is not nece&s;&s;ary for every Per&s;on among the fallen Race of <HI>Adam,</HI> to find out the real and eternal Nece&s;&s;ity of his coming to God by a Mediator, or that &s;uch an Atonement mu&s;t needs be made for the Sins of Men, yet &s;ince God &s;aw it mo&s;t proper to appoint this way, and to ordain his Son <HI>Je&s;us</HI> to be this Mediator and this Atone|ment, and to reveal it in &s;o many plain and expre&s;s Declarations of his Word, I think it may be readily agreed, that it is our evident Duty, now we know this Go&s;pel, to approve of this Atonement &s;o plainly revealed, and this Mediator, as a mo&s;t rea&s;onable Appointment, and to come near to God by him, even by <HI>Faith in his Blood,</HI> if we would find certain Acceptance with God.</NOTE>: We mu&s;t approve of him as our great Teacher, and our glorious Example; as our High-Prie&s;t to reconcile us to God by his Blood, and to make Inter|ce&s;&s;ion for us at the Mercy-Seat in Heaven; as <HI>one that is able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t, becau&s;e he lives forever</HI> to fulfil all his Offices.

Thus the Faith of the Sinner eccho's to the Voice of God concerning <HI>Je&s;us</HI> the Saviour, in a way of A&s;&s;ent to what God has reveal'd, and in a way of humble Appro|bation of what God has appointed.</P>

Therefore though the Go&s;pel be &s;ent to be preached to all the World in ge|neral, and Salvation to be offer'd them through <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> yet we are told often by the Evangeli&s;t <HI>John,</HI> of tho&s;e particular Per&s;ons whom the Father had given unto <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> that they might be his, <HI>i. e.</HI> his Seed, his Subjects, and his willing People.</P>
<P>In Conformity to this great Act of the Father in committing the Souls of Men into the Hands of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> we al&s;o having &s;een him all-&s;ufficient for this Work, mu&s;t <HI>commit our Souls into his Hand,</HI> as one <HI>able to keep what we commit to him until the la&s;t Day</HI>: We mu&s;t re&s;ign our&s;elves unto him, as a glorious Undertaker for our Salvation: We mu&s;t receive him, or be willing to &s;ubmit to him, in all his appointed Offices of Prophet, Prie&s;t, King, Example, Head of Influence, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that we may receive from him every thing that we &s;tand in need of, in order to our being brought home to God in Heaven.

with God, and we mu&s;t &s;eek to him to form our Na|tures &s;o far in the Likene&s;s of God, as to fit us for Happine&s;s in the Enjoyment of God for ever.

<P N="8">8.

<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>MAnkind by Nature lies under the Ruins of the Fall; both as <HI>Guilty</HI> and as <HI>Sinful.</HI> We are guilty in our <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> and expo&s;ed to the divine Anger, as well as &s;inful in our <HI>Natures,</HI> and ever ready to break his holy Law. Who&s;oever therefore becomes our complete Saviour mu&s;t relieve us under both the&s;e Di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>As we are <HI>guilty</HI> in the Sight of God, we are con|demned in the Court of his Law and Ju&s;tice, we are liable to bear the Puni&s;hment due to our Sins, and we have lo&s;t all Pretence of Right to the Favour of God and Eternal Life. Now our ble&s;&s;ed Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> who has undertaken the Work of our Salvation, is an all-&s;ufficient Saviour in every Re&s;pect; by his Obedi|ence, Death and Interce&s;&s;ion, he relieves us from the Guilt of Sin, and &s;o delivers us from all Obligations to the Puni&s;hments of Hell: He reconciles us to God, and gives us a Right to Life and Salvation in the heavenly World.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="006440_0182_1028F0E59755B588">As we are <HI>&s;inful</HI> Creatures we are ever ready to offend God afre&s;h, and are utterly unfit for his heavenly Pre&s;ence: And <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;aves us in this Re&s;pect, by changing our vicious Nature and Temper, &s;anctifying us by his Grace or Holy Spirit, &s;o that we may be prepar'd for the Enjoyment of God in heavenly Places.</P>
<P>In the&s;e two things the Sub&s;tance of our Salvation chiefly con&s;i&s;ts: And &s;ince the&s;e divine Affairs could not be &s;o well under&s;tood by us, according to tho&s;e &s;ublime Ideas by which God the Father and his Son tran&s;act them in their Eternal Coun&s;els and their &s;ub|&s;equent Di&s;pen&s;ations, therefore God has been plea&s;ed to reveal them to us under &s;uch Ideas or Repre&s;enta|tions, and in &s;uch Forms of Language, as are borrow'd from our common Affairs in human Life; and that not only by <HI>one</HI> Figure or Emblem, but by many Re|pre&s;entations thereof, that we might view them on all Sides, and have a fuller Knowledge of them, &s;o far as is &s;ufficient for our pre&s;ent State, or nece&s;&s;ary to our Salvation.</P>

<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Let us take a very brief Survey of this Matter, as our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> delivers us from our <HI>&s;inful Natures,</HI> or the Power of Sin that works in us, for he is our <HI>Sanctification</HI> as well as our <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> i. 30.</P>
<P>Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour in this Re&s;pect, is &s;ometimes repre&s;ented as our almighty <HI>Redeemer,</HI> who re&s;cues us from the Power of <HI>Satan,</HI> and of our own Lu&s;ts, by the more powerful Influences of his Spirit: He is our
<PB N="168" REF="006440_0183_1028F0EA16AA0468">
<HI>Sanctifier,</HI> who renews the Image of God in us, which was lo&s;t by our fir&s;t Apo&s;tacy, and this he does by his &s;overeign creating Power, for we are <HI>created anew to good Works,</HI> in or by <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> He is &s;ometimes &s;et forth as <HI>our Prophet,</HI> to give us Light and the Knowledge of God, and of the way of Salvation, by the divine In&s;tructions of his Go&s;pel. He is our <HI>Ex|ample</HI> to go before us, and to mark out for us the Path of Duty and Holine&s;s by his own Foot&s;teps, and to encourage our walking therein by his Precedency, and &s;o he is al&s;o our <HI>Forerunner</HI> to Heaven. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is al&s;o our <HI>King</HI> to give us Laws and Rules of Life, and to rule in our Hearts by giving us an Inclination to obey his Laws: By his royal Power al&s;o in his exalted State, he &s;ubdues Sin in us, he mortifies our unruly Appetites and Pa&s;&s;ions which are his Enemies, he brings every Power of our Nature into Obedience and Sub|jection to him&s;elf. He fits us for the heavenly King|dom, and actually be&s;tows upon us this final Happi|ne&s;s. He is al&s;o repre&s;ented in Scripture as our <HI>Vital Head,</HI> or Head of &s;piritual Life, and Believers are his <HI>Members</HI>; and &s;o his Spirit becomes the Spring of &s;pi|ritual Life in us, renews our &s;inful Nature, rai&s;es us from Death in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins, conveys a new and divine Life to us, and will at la&s;t, by the &s;ame Spirit, rai&s;e our Bodies from the Dead to live forever with him.</P>

<P N="1">I.

This is the very Signification of his proper Name <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> in the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> Matt. i. 21. <HI>Thou &s;halt call his Name</HI> Je&s;us, <HI>for he &s;hall &s;ave his People from their Sins.</HI> He &s;aves or de|livers us from Sin, and from all the painful or criminal Effects and Con&s;equences thereof: <HI>He delivers us from the Wrath to come,</HI> 1 The&s;&s;. i. <HI>ult.</HI> he &s;aves us by withholding the divine Anger from us, and taking away every thing that provoked it, or might provoke it.</P>

Virtue and Efficacy of this Blood of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> for the procuring our Pardon: It is a &s;ort of <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of our Sins over the Head of the Sacrifice</HI> which was an ancient Ceremony in the Levitical <HI>Law,</HI> &s;ometimes performed by the Offender, and &s;ometimes by the Prie&s;t, whereby Sins were transferred to the Sacrifice who was to &s;uffer for them, either by being &s;lain, or by being &s;ent into the Land of Separation and De&s;truction, <HI>Lev.</HI> i. 4. and iii. 13. and v. 6. and xvi. 21. It is as it were a putting our guilty Souls under the &s;prinkling of this atoning Blood, that we may be clean&s;ed from every Defile|ment; and it doth, as it were, pre&s;ent to God the Father, that Blood on which our Hope is placed.</P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is yet farther repre&s;ented to us as an <HI>Ad|vocate,</HI> which Idea is a very different thing from his Interce&s;&s;ion as a <HI>High-Prie&s;t.</HI> 1 John ii. 2. <HI>If any Man &s;in, we have an Advocate with the Father, Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Righteous.</HI> The proper De&s;ign of an <HI>High-Prie&s;t</HI> is to tran&s;act Affairs between God and Man, for Recon|ciliation and Divine Favour, &amp;c. An <HI>Advocate</HI> is a Per&s;on appointed and cho&s;en to plead before a Court of Ju&s;tice again&s;t a Charge or Accu&s;a|tion, and by his Pleading to bring off his Client with Honour, or to defend one who is charged with a Crime, from the Condemnation and Death which might be due to it. So our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> our Ad|vocate, pleads again&s;t the Charges which the Law of God, or which <HI>Satan,</HI> our Adver&s;ary, may bring again&s;t us; not by pretending that we are not guilty, but by pleading the Atonement made by his Blood for our Sins, by pleading our Pardon in the Court of Heaven, and by pleading his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, as the Founda|tion of our Hope; and therefore as the Apo&s;tle in this very Text calls him <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Righteous,</HI> in Rev. xii. 10, 11. <HI>Satan</HI> is repre&s;ented as <HI>accu&s;ing the Saints Day and Night before God. Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is their Advo|cate,

repre&s;enting his own Blood, and in this Sen&s;e they are &s;aid to <HI>ca&s;t down the Accu&s;er by the Blood of the Lamb,</HI> which pleads and <HI>&s;peaks better Things than the Blood of Abel. i. e.</HI> it pleads for Mercy, whereas the Blood of <HI>Abel</HI> pleaded for Vengeance.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Salvation,</HI> in this Sen&s;e, is called <HI>Freedom from Guilt,</HI> Ab&s;olution or Acquitment from the Penalty, and a Vindication of <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> from the Charge of Sin, and the Condemnation thereof, which is obtained by the prevailing Power and Intere&s;t which <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> our Advocate has at the Court of Heaven, and by repre|&s;enting before the Throne of God our Pardon pur|cha&s;ed by his Blood, &s;o that <HI>Satan</HI> has no further Charge again&s;t us.</P>
<P>By <HI>Faith</HI> we commit our Ca&s;e and Circum&s;tances to this great <HI>Advocate,</HI> and we become his <HI>Clients,</HI> Dependants upon him; and in this Sen&s;e <HI>Faith</HI> may be &s;aid to <HI>ca&s;t down our Accu&s;er by the Blood of the Lamb,</HI> by tru&s;ting in this great and ble&s;&s;ed Advocate, or re|&s;igning the important Concerns of our Souls to his Care and Faithfulne&s;s, to be tran&s;acted by him before the Bar of God in Heaven.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is &s;et forth as our <HI>Spon&s;or</HI> or <HI>Surety,</HI> Heb. vii. 22. <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was <HI>made a Surety of a better Te&s;tament, i. e.</HI> the new Covenant of Grace, as manife&s;ted in the Go&s;pel. A <HI>Surety</HI> is properly one, who undertakes for another to do or &s;uffer &s;ome|thing for him, or who undertakes that this other Per&s;on &s;hall do &s;uch Services, or &s;uffer &s;uch Pe|nalties, or enjoy &s;uch Privileges. So our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> has undertaken to an&s;wer the Demands of the Law of God for us who had broken it, to pay a Com|pen&s;ation for our Violations of the Law, and to make Peace betwixt God and us. He has al&s;o undertaken, that all his People &s;hall be &s;anctified and brought &s;afely to the heavenly World. So <HI>Judah</HI> became a
<PB N="175" REF="006440_0190_1028F0FCEEB1B088">
Surety to his Father <HI>Jacob</HI> for his Brother <HI>Benjamin,</HI> whom he took with him into <HI>Egypt.</HI> Gen. xliii. 9. <HI>I will be Surety for him; of mine Hands &s;halt thou require him. Reuben</HI> in the foregoing Chapter was in like manner a <HI>Spon&s;or</HI> for him, <HI>v.</HI> 37. <HI>Deliver him into my Hands, and I will bring him to thee again:</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> bound <HI>Simeon</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI> as a <HI>Surety</HI> for the Return of his Brethren, and <HI>Benjamin</HI> with them, <HI>v.</HI> 19, 36.</P>
<P>Now as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was our <HI>Surety,</HI> &s;o our <HI>Salvation</HI> may be called a Freedom from our Obligation to the Penal Law of God, which our Lord <HI>Je&s;us</HI> took upon him&s;elf to an&s;wer, Rom. vii. 6. <HI>We are deliver'd from the Law, that being dead wherein we were held</HI>: Gal. iii. 13. <HI>Chri&s;t hath redeemed us,</HI> or freed us <HI>from the Cur&s;e of the Law, being made a Cur&s;e for us.</HI> Nor is this Obligation of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as a <HI>Spon&s;or,</HI> quite fulfilled till he has brought us all to Heaven, and can &s;ay to his Father, <HI>Lord, here am I, and the Children which thou ha&s;t given me,</HI> as Heb. ii. 13. and &s;hall <HI>pre&s;ent us before</HI> the Throne <HI>without Spot or Blemi&s;h,</HI> Jude 24, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and Ephe&s;. v. 25, 26, 27.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Faith</HI> gives us an Intere&s;t in all that <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> has done as our <HI>Spon&s;or</HI> by tru&s;ting our&s;elves with him intirely under that Character, and accepting him as the <HI>Surety</HI> of this everla&s;ting Covenant.</P>
<P N="7">VII. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is exhibited in Scripture as the <HI>&s;econd Adam,</HI> as a <HI>common Head</HI> of his People, as a <HI>publick Per&s;on,</HI> and their <HI>Repre&s;entative.</HI> This has &s;ome Dif|ference in it from the former Character, though in many re&s;pects they agree and coincide. <HI>Adam</HI> was the Head of all his Offspring, a <HI>common Per&s;on</HI> and <HI>Repre|&s;entative</HI> for them, but not &s;o properly their <HI>Surety</HI> in every Sen&s;e. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is what <HI>Adam</HI> was, <HI>Rom.</HI> v. 14. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xv. 47. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is not a common Per&s;on or Re|pre&s;entative in his <HI>Interce&s;&s;ion</HI> or his <HI>Advocate&s;hip,</HI> tho' he is properly a <HI>Surety</HI> therein, for he has undertaken
<PB N="176" REF="006440_0191_1028F0FF763DF4B0">
as a Surety for us, to Plead in the Court of Heaven, and to bring us off with Safety and Honour: But in his <HI>Obedience,</HI> in his <HI>Death,</HI> and his <HI>Appearance</HI> for us in Heaven, he is our <HI>common Head</HI> and <HI>Repre&s;entative.</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>Salvation</HI> in this Sen&s;e, may be called <HI>the Glory of God.</HI> Rom. v. 2. <HI>We rejoice in hope of the Glory of God:</HI> And it may be called <HI>Eternal Life.</HI> Both the&s;e de&s;cribe the Happine&s;s which was promi&s;ed to Man upon his perfect Obedience to the Law at fir&s;t. <HI>Rom.</HI> ii. 10. and iii. 23. By Sin <HI>we are fallen &s;hort of the Glory of God</HI>; but we obtain by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t Salvation with eternal Glory.</HI> In this Sen&s;e <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is our <HI>Forerunner into Heaven,</HI> and he, as our public Repre&s;entative, appears there for us, and has taken up Places or Man&s;ions in our Name, <HI>Heb.</HI> vi. la&s;t. We &s;hall <HI>&s;it on his Thrones. Rev.</HI> iii. 21. 'Tis al&s;o called an <HI>Inheritance,</HI> and we are <HI>Heirs of God and joint Heirs with Chri&s;t,</HI> Rom. viii. 17. as we are one with him.</P>
<P><HI>Faith</HI> accepts of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as our <HI>common Head,</HI> or great <HI>Repre&s;entative,</HI> and gives us an Intere&s;t in this Salvation, by uniting us to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and making us one with him. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is the Original Son of God, and we are al&s;o the <HI>Sons of God by Faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> Gal. iii. 26. and thus we are <HI>Coheirs with Chri&s;t,</HI> he as the Head, and we as the Members; and <HI>Faith &s;aves</HI> us as it has been called the <HI>Bond of Union</HI> between <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and us. When we become Believers in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> whatever was done to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as a Head or a common Per&s;on, is then applied to us, either in the Right to it, or in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was ju&s;tified from Sin, <HI>i. e.</HI> from all im|puted Sin, at his Re&s;urrection, and when we become the Seed of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> by Regeneration through Faith, we are ju&s;tified in him, much in the &s;ame manner as we were condemned in <HI>Adam, i. e.</HI> as &s;oon as we become the Sons of <HI>Adam</HI> by a natural Birth: As there is no new actual and particular Sentence of Condemnation
<PB N="177" REF="006440_0192_1028F10105A1B238">
pa&s;t upon us at our Birth, but we fall under the ge|neral Condemnation, when we become the Sons of <HI>Adam</HI>; &s;o there is no new Act of Ju&s;tification pa&s;&s;ed by God upon the Creature at his Regeneration or Be|lieving, but the Word of God, which is his Sentence, pronounces us ju&s;tified at our Faith, or our New Birth; and our Condemnation is taken away as &s;oon as we are in <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Rom. viii. 1. <HI>There is no Condemnation now to them that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. Another Character which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;u&s;tains, is that of a <HI>Redeemer,</HI> and it is generally repre&s;ented, both in the Scripture and by our Divines, as one who redeems us both <HI>by Power</HI> and <HI>by Price.</HI> Now the <HI>Redemption</HI> of us by his <HI>powerful</HI> Grace out of the Sla|very of <HI>Satan,</HI> and our own Lu&s;ts, and our Re&s;cue from the Temptations of this World, belong rather to the other Part of this Salvation, wherein his &s;anctifying Influences are nece&s;&s;ary and requi&s;ite: But when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is con&s;idered as a <HI>Redeemer by Price,</HI> he frees us by the Price of his own Blood as a Ran&s;om, chiefly from the Hands of the vindictive Ju&s;tice of God, and from the Bonds of the Guilt of Sin and Condemna|tion, whereby we are held as Breakers of the Law of God. Yet our <HI>Redemption</HI> from the Slavery of Sin and <HI>Satan</HI> may be al&s;o attributed to the Blood of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> which purcha&s;ed &s;anctifying Grace for us. The Name of a Redeemer is very applicable to both Parts of our Salvation. So he gave his Life a Ran&s;om <HI>for many.</HI> Matth. xx. 28. <HI>He redeemed us from the Cur&s;e of the law, by being made a Cur&s;e for us,</HI> Gal. iii. 13. <HI>He re|deemed us al&s;o by his precious Blood as of a Lamb without Blemi&s;h or Spot from our vain Conver&s;ation or Slavery to Sin,</HI> 1 Pet. i. 18, 19. and <HI>Thou art worthy, for thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t &s;lain, and ha&s;t redeemed us to God by thy Blood,</HI> Rev. v. 9.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="006440_0193_1028F102921E4288"><HI>Salvation</HI> in this Re&s;pect is called <HI>Redemption,</HI> Rom. iii. 24. <HI>Eternal Redemption,</HI> Heb. ix. 12. and we are &s;aid to be <HI>bought with a Price,</HI> 1 Cor. vi. 20. <HI>and therefore we are the Lord's and not our own.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Faith</HI> applies this Benefit to us by our accepting the Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> under this Character as a <HI>Redeems</HI> of our Per&s;ons from this Condemnation, or as our great Friend who ran&s;om'd our Souls from Impri&s;on|ment under the Bonds of the condemning Law and Ju&s;tice of God, who purcha&s;ed and ran&s;omed us from our Captivity, Bonds and Mi&s;eries in every Sen&s;e.</P>
<P N="9">IX. To &s;um up all other Characters, I add in the la&s;t Place, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is repre&s;ented as our great <HI>Friend</HI> and <HI>Be|nefactor,</HI> one who came down from Heaven to &s;eek and to &s;ave lo&s;t Sinners here on Earth: He made a vi&s;it to our World to take &s;pecial Notice of all our Wants, in order to relieve them all, and to do, and to procure for us what&s;oever we &s;tood in need of, in order to our Eternal Happine&s;s. Under this Character he fir&s;t in|&s;tructed or taught us the Doctrine of our lo&s;t E&s;tate, and acquainted us with the Methods of his Salvation; he procured or purcha&s;ed for us, by his Death, not only pardon of Sin and future Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, but every Grace and every Ble&s;&s;ing which was nece&s;&s;ary, in order to our full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Heaven, and no <HI>greater Friend|&s;hip</HI> can any Man &s;hew to another, than to <HI>lay down his Life for him,</HI> John xv. 13.</P>
<P>Under this View <HI>Salvation</HI> or <HI>Eternal Life</HI> is called the <HI>Gift of God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> Rom. vi. 23. <HI>Abundance of Grace and the Gift of Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> in order <HI>to reign in Life,</HI> Rom. v. 17. He bought again for us our forfeited Inheritance in Heaven.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve this Notion of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as a <HI>Benefactor</HI> re&s;pects his doing every Kindne&s;s, and procuring or purcha&s;ing every <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> for us, and be&s;towing it upon us; whereas in the Character of a <HI>Redeemer</HI> he bought
<PB N="179" REF="006440_0194_1028F106E998C5F0">
or purcha&s;ed our <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> from Impri&s;onment and Condemnation.</P>
<P><HI>Faith</HI> gives us an Intere&s;t in the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as a <HI>Benefactor,</HI> when it comes to him, and &s;eeks them at his Hand, when it humbly depends upon <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> for them, and tru&s;ts in him to be&s;tow them. Thus our <HI>Faith</HI> is like a Hand, whereby we receive the&s;e Ble&s;|&s;ings which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> has to be&s;tow, or like the Feet where|by we <HI>come</HI> or <HI>fly</HI> to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to partake of them; or it may be liken'd to the <HI>Voice of Petition,</HI> whereby we &s;eek them at his Hands, and <HI>call upon the Lord</HI> to be&s;tow them.</P>
<P>Thus I have briefly run through many of the Scrip|tural Characters or Offices, whereby our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is repre&s;ented to us, whereby our <HI>Salvation</HI> is &s;et forth, and whereby our <HI>Faith</HI> is de&s;cribed as the ap|pointed Means of our Intere&s;t in them. 'Tis evident enough they often run into one another, nor did the Go&s;pel ever de&s;ign that the&s;e &s;everal Repre&s;entations of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> of his <HI>Salvation</HI> and of our <HI>Faith,</HI> &s;hould be kept &s;o &s;eparate by exact <HI>logical</HI> Forms of Expre&s;&s;ion, as to plea&s;e Schola&s;tic Readers only; but that plain &s;incere Souls under a Sen&s;e of Guilt and Condemna|tion, might &s;ee and view them on every Side, and might find &s;omething in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;uited to their Sen&s;a|tion of their own Wants and Mi&s;eries, and apply them&s;elves to him for Relief; but this &s;hall be the Subject of the next <HI>Section.</HI></P>

When the ble&s;&s;ed God has taken &s;o much care to provide &s;uch a Saviour for us, and &s;uch as illu&s;trious Salvation, he is very de&s;irous that we &s;hould view it on all Sides, and be more thoroughly acquainted with it, as well as with that ble&s;&s;ed Per&s;on by whom he prepares and be|&s;tows it.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="006440_0196_1028F10C01886520"><HI>Rea&s;on</HI> 3.

<P>Thus has God been plea&s;ed al&s;o to do in the various Repre&s;entations he has made of <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI> our Saviour, that our Meditations and Prayers, our Hopes and De|pendencies, and indeed all the pious Exerci&s;es of our Souls towards <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> might have a rich Variety for our Entertainment, Support and Joy; and therefore the Apo&s;tles have written the&s;e things unto the Di&s;|ciples of <HI>Chri&s;t, that their Joy might be full.</HI> 1 John i. 4.</P>
<P>I add 5thly, another <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> is, that God our Father and <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> out Saviour might have the larger

Revenues of Glory from us, and receive Honour from our Hands in a rich Variety; that we might have our Thank-Offerings ri&s;ing up to God and the Lamb, in many Forms of Adoration and Expre&s;&s;ion; that we might ble&s;s our dear Redeemer, rejoice in him, and do Honour to his Name under all tho&s;e happy Repre|&s;entations of his Grace and Glory, in which he has &s;et him&s;elf before us in the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>The la&s;t <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> I will add, &s;hall be this: That in all Ages the Followers of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> might have a more clear and ea&s;y Relief, from tho&s;e Difficulties and Controver|&s;ies which may attend the&s;e great Doctrines of our Salvation, and which might darken and perplex the Way whereby God has appointed us to be made Par|takers of this Ble&s;&s;ing.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. IV.</HI> The Difficulties which are relieved by this various Repre&s;en|tation of the Salvation of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Since God has &s;et forth our ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Saviour</HI> with his <HI>Salvation,</HI> and our <HI>Faith</HI> which intere&s;ts us therein, under &s;o many various Characters and Expre&s;&s;ions, the following Difficulties will be very much relieved hereby, and &s;everal Controver&s;ies aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P N="1">1. A Chri&s;tian who reads the&s;e things in his Bible, cannot &s;ay that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> has &s;aved us in this particular manner, and therefore he did not &s;ave us in the other; as for In&s;tance,</P>
<P>When we read or a&s;&s;ert that <HI>Chri&s;t was put to Death</HI> for us, as <HI>a Sacrifice for our Sins,</HI> we cannot &s;ay, there|fore <HI>he did not &s;ave us as a High Prie&s;t:</HI> Or when we read or a&s;&s;ert that he &s;aved us <HI>as our High-Prie&s;t,</HI> we cannot &s;ay, therefore <HI>he was not a Sacrifice</HI>; for the Scriptures a&s;&s;ure us, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf is both the <HI>High-Prie&s;t</HI>
<PB N="184" REF="006440_0199_1028F14CC0B28EF0">
and the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> al&s;o, Eph. v. 2. <HI>Chri&s;t hath given him&s;elf for us as an Offering and Sacrifice to God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> One Chri&s;tian will perhaps be ready to main|tain, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;aves us as a great <HI>Friend</HI> and <HI>Benefactor,</HI> who has, by the Price of his Blood, purcha&s;ed the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> of Grace and Glory for us, and be&s;tows them upon us; another may chu&s;e to fix his Eye more upon <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as a <HI>Redeemer,</HI> and &s;ay he has bought or purcha&s;ed our <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> from the Hands of divine Ju&s;tice, or he has redeemed us from the Cur&s;e of the Law, and from the Bonds wherein we, as Criminals, were held by the Law of God: But neither of them &s;hould dare to &s;ay, <HI>he bought or purcha&s;ed the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> for us, and therefore <HI>he did not purcha&s;e our Per&s;ons</HI>; for he has done both the&s;e under different Characters.</P>
<P>Yet further, one Chri&s;tian may delight more to fix his Eye and Hope on <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as a <HI>Surety</HI> or <HI>Repre&s;enta|tive</HI> of his Elect, or of tho&s;e whom he certainly and finally &s;aves, and on that account he &s;uffered Death particularly <HI>in their room and &s;tead,</HI> and &s;ecured to them certain Deliverance and Salvation; yet he cannot therefore affirm, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> did not, in any Sen&s;e, die for all Men, as a general Friend of Man, or &s;uffer Death <HI>for their Good;</HI> nor can he &s;ay, that the Benefits of his Death do not any way reach to all Mankind. Another perhaps will &s;ay, <HI>&s;ince all are dead, he died for all</HI> as a <HI>common Mediator</HI> betwixt God and Man, or as a <HI>general Benefactor</HI> to procure <HI>conditional</HI> Salvation for all Men, and offer it to them if they are willing to come to him and receive it; but he cannot &s;ay, that he was not a <HI>proper Surety,</HI> or <HI>Repre&s;entative</HI> of his Elect, vhereby he has <HI>&s;ecured certain</HI> Salvation to them only: For as I have &s;hewn in former Papers, that he by his Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Death has directly and <HI>ab|&s;olutely</HI> procured this Salvation for his Elect, as their <HI>Head</HI> and <HI>Repre&s;entative,</HI> but yet he has al&s;o
<PB N="185" REF="006440_0200_1028F113E3F093A8">
procured Salvation, with all the Glories of it, <HI>conditi|onally,</HI> for the re&s;t of Mankind, upon which Founda|tion the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings are offer'd to all Men in the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is another &s;ort of Difficulty from which the&s;e various Repre&s;entations of the Salvation of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> may deliver and relieve us, (<HI>viz.</HI>) The Actions or the Sufferings of our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> have not preci&s;ely the &s;ame Relation, Character or Effect, with regard to one of his Offices, as they have with regard to another; and therefore what is pronounced &s;afely, with regard to the <HI>Death of Chri&s;t</HI> under one Character, cannot be with Safety pronounced concerning it under another. As for Example,</P>
<P>When &s;o glorious and illu&s;trious a Per&s;on as <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> appears as our <HI>Friend</HI> and <HI>Benefactor,</HI> he paid &s;o &s;ublime a Price by his Death and Sufferings, as in a &s;trict Sen&s;e to &s;atisfy or make full Recompence for all our Violations of the Law of God, and to merit Pardon and Eternal Life at the Hand of God for us: But when we con&s;ider him merely as our <HI>Repre&s;entative,</HI> or our <HI>Surety,</HI> and to an&s;wer what the Law demanded of us, he cannot be &s;o properly &s;aid to merit our Pardon, or to make full and abundant Recompence to the Ju&s;tice of God for our Offences; for this might lead or in|courage Per&s;ons to infer, that we our&s;elves have &s;a|tisfied God, or made Recompence to him in the Per&s;on of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> or that we have merited our Pardon and our Salvation, becau&s;e what he did intirely as our <HI>Repre|&s;entative,</HI> we may in &s;ome &s;ort be e&s;teemed to have done in and by him.</P>
<P>Again, the Death of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as a <HI>Surety</HI> and the <HI>&s;econd Adam</HI> was his &s;uffering of the Cur&s;e of the Law, and the Penalty thereof in our &s;tead, which we had incurred; and in this View his Death and his Dereliction, or being for&s;aken of the Father, was the <HI>Idem,</HI> or Same, which
<PB N="186" REF="006440_0201_1028F116C0D26F18">
Sinners &s;hould have &s;uffer'd; tho' in other Re&s;pects, and when we con&s;ider him as a glorious <HI>Mediator,</HI> or &s;uper-eminent <HI>Benefactor,</HI> then he appears with all the Dignity of his indwelling Godhead, and in this Sen&s;e he paid a Price of &s;uperior Value, his Death is the <HI>Tan|tundem</HI>; and more, he makes an abundant Compen&s;a|tion for Sin, and a Satisfaction to the Demands of the Law, and honours the Ju&s;tice of God more than our everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment could do, and hereby he merits for us tho&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings which are above all our Reach, or Pretences, or Obligations to procure or merit for our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Again, as he was a <HI>Redeemer,</HI> his Death is a <HI>Price paid for our Souls</HI> to Divine Ju&s;tice, in order to relea&s;e us from the Bonds of Condemnation: But his Death as a <HI>Benefactor,</HI> may be rather con&s;ider'd as a <HI>Price for the Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> which he purcha&s;ed for us, and of which we are made Partakers thro' him.</P>
<P N="3">3. There are other Difficulties which are &s;tarted among the &s;everal Controver&s;ies of Chri&s;tians with re|gard to our <HI>Faith,</HI> and the way and manner whereby this <HI>Faith</HI> intere&s;ts us in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his Salvation: And &s;ince <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> has &s;u&s;tained &s;o many Characters and Of|fices, and &s;tands in &s;o many Relations to us, our <HI>Faith</HI> is exerci&s;ed towards him in a Corre&s;pondency to each of the&s;e Relations and Characters; and therefore when we read or a&s;&s;ert that our <HI>Faith</HI> &s;aves us in this way, or under this <HI>Logical</HI> Relation, we dare not therefore a&s;&s;ert, that it cannot &s;ave us in any other way, or under another <HI>Logical</HI> Relation. I would endeavour to make this thing a little more clear, becau&s;e there have many Controver&s;ies ari&s;en upon this Head.</P>
<P>Let us then briefly recollect or take a &s;hort Survey of the &s;everal Repre&s;entations which are given us of <HI>Faith in Chri&s;t,</HI> according to the&s;e different Characters of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="006440_0202_1028F1184D47DB48"><HI>Faith</HI> in its mo&s;t general Sen&s;e, Nature and De&s;ign, as it refers to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> is the Application or Addre&s;s of the Soul to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> or to God by him, under any or all the&s;e Characters, whereby he and his Salvation are &s;et forth in Scripture. Now the&s;e Characters being &s;o very different and various, require different manners of Addre&s;s to him, which are repre&s;ented in Scripture, which perhaps may be all included in <HI>Faith</HI> taken in its large&s;t Sen&s;e, together with tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary Acts of the Soul which mu&s;t accompany, attend, or follow it.</P>
<P>Particularly then <HI>Faith</HI> is &s;ometimes repre&s;ented by believing his Go&s;pel, Mark i. 15. <HI>Repent and believe the Go&s;pel:</HI> But here it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that all the proper and &s;anctifying Effects of this Faith mu&s;t attend it, and it mu&s;t not re&s;t in a mere A&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>'Tis a Knowledge of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> John xvii. 3. <HI>This is Life Eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent.</HI> I&s;ai. liii. 11. <HI>By his Knowledge,</HI> or the Knowledge of him, <HI>&s;hall he ju&s;tify many</HI>: And here I might add, that this our Knowledge requires a corre&s;pondent Practice, otherwi&s;e it will be of no more avail towards Salvation, than the Knowledge of <HI>Devils, who believe and tremble.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis a Believing in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> which perhaps ought rather to be render'd <HI>Tru&s;ting in Chri&s;t.</HI> I&s;ai. ii. 10. compar'd with Rom. xv. 12. <HI>In him &s;hall the Gentiles tru&s;t,</HI> 2 Tim. i. 12. <HI>I know whom I have believed, or tru&s;ted,</HI> Eph. i. 12, 13. <HI>who fir&s;t tru&s;ted in Chri&s;t,</HI> or <HI>hoped in him,</HI> as in the Original.</P>
<P>Believing in his Name, John i. 12. <HI>To them gave he Power to become the Sons of God, even to as many as be|lieved on his Name.</HI></P>
<P>Seeking to him, I&s;ai. xi. 10. <HI>To him &s;hall the Gentiles &s;eek.</HI></P>
<P>Receiving <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> John i. 12. <HI>To as many as received

him,</HI> &amp;c. Colo&s;&s;. ii. 6. <HI>As you have received</HI> Chri&s;t, <HI>&s;o walk in him.</HI></P>
<P>Laying hold of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> I&s;ai. xxvii. 5. <HI>Let him take hold of my Strength that he may make Peace with me.</HI> Heb. vi. 18. <HI>Tho&s;e who have fled for Refuge to lay hold of the Hope &s;et before them.</HI></P>
<P>Hearing of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> or hearkening to him, Luke ix. 35. <HI>This is my beloved Son, hear ye him,</HI> or <HI>hearken unto him.</HI></P>
<P>Calling upon <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> Rom. x. 12, 13. <HI>Who&s;oever &s;hall call on the Name of the Lord &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI></P>
<P>Coming unto <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> Matt. xi. 28. <HI>Come unto me all ye that Labour,</HI> &amp;c. John v. 40. <HI>Ye will not come unto me that ye may have Life.</HI></P>
<P>Flying to him for Refuge, <HI>Heb.</HI> vi. 18. as before.</P>
<P>Looking unto <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> or beholding him, I&s;ai. xiv. 25. <HI>Look unto me all ye Ends of the Earth and be &s;aved.</HI> I&s;ai. lxv. 1. <HI>I &s;aid, behold me, behold me, to a Nation not called by my Name.</HI></P>
<P>Obeying <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> Heb. v. 9. <HI>He became the Author of Eternal Salvation to them that obey him.</HI></P>
<P>Believing in God through <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> 1 Pet. i. 21. <HI>Who by him do believe in God.</HI></P>
<P>Coming to God by <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> John xiv. 6. <HI>No Man cometh to the Father but by me.</HI></P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee <HI>Faith,</HI> together with its various Con|comitants, or con&s;equent Exerci&s;es of Soul, is repre|&s;ented as our Addre&s;s or Application to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> for Sal|vation by and with almo&s;t all the Sen&s;es or Powers of Nature: 'Tis looking to him with the <HI>Eye,</HI> 'tis hearken|ing to him with the <HI>Ear,</HI> 'tis receiving or laying hold of him with the <HI>Hand,</HI> 'tis coming to him with the <HI>Feet,</HI> 'tis Knowledge of him in the <HI>Head,</HI> tru&s;t in him with the <HI>Heart,</HI> calling upon him with the <HI>Tongue,</HI> and obeying him with all the <HI>Powers of Soul and Body.</HI></P>
<P>Now 'tis well known, that there have been great Di&s;putes about the particular Influence which this <HI>Acts of
<PB N="189" REF="006440_0204_1028F1200C4EFC58">
Faith</HI> has, in order to intere&s;t us in the Salvation of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>: And here I will readily grant, that the Word <HI>Faith</HI> pri|marily and chiefly implies &s;uch a Knowledge of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;uch a Belief of his Go&s;pel, &s;uch a Sen&s;e of our Wants, and his Sufficiency to &s;upply them, as leads the Soul to receive him under any of tho&s;e Characters in which the Go&s;pel &s;ets him forth, and more particularly to <HI>tru&s;t in him</HI> for this Salvation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may be ob&s;erved here, that almo&s;t every Character or Action, whereby <HI>Faith in Chri&s;t</HI> is repre&s;ented in Scripture, carries in it the Notion of <HI>Tru&s;t, Hope</HI> or <HI>Dependance,</HI> &s;o that the original and mo&s;t proper Sen&s;e of the Word Faith is &s;till maintained, and every Sinner who &s;incerely applies him&s;elf to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> for Salvation, does certainly put forth an Act of <HI>Tru&s;t</HI> or <HI>Hope</HI> in him, though he may not always &s;o evidently and di&s;tinctly apprehend and judge of the inward Acts of his own Soul, or di&s;tingui&s;h them &s;o exactly.</NOTE>: But there are many poor Souls who have learnt &s;incerely to addre&s;s them&s;elves to our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> by one or two of the&s;e Characters and Repre&s;en|tations of <HI>Faith,</HI> but were never carried on &s;o far as ex|plicitely to make an Addre&s;s to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> under all his di&s;|tinct Relations, or to perform every one of the&s;e Actions in their Addre&s;&s;es to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>: And can I &s;uppo&s;e where the Soul is very &s;incere in its De&s;ires of the whole Salva|tion of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> both in the Holine&s;s and the Happine&s;s of it, and &s;eeks it from him, that &s;uch Souls &s;hall be ex|cluded, becau&s;e they have not well learnt all the Meta|phors and Figures under which the&s;e &s;acred Things are exhibited in the Go&s;pel?</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> on the other hand, if one &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>Faith</HI> &s;aves us as it is an <HI>Eye</HI> to look to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> that we may be &s;aved, he cannot thence infer it does not &s;ave us as an <HI>Ear</HI> to hearken to him, as an <HI>Hand</HI> to lay hold of him, or as a <HI>Tongue</HI> to call upon him, or a <HI>Heart</HI> to tru&s;t in him.</P>

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Perhaps there have been no greater Quarrels upon this Subject than among&s;t tho&s;e who have maintain'd that <HI>Faith</HI> &s;aves us as it is an <HI>In&s;trument,</HI> whereby we receive <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ert it is a <HI>Condition</HI> upon which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> has appointed us to be intere&s;ted in his Ble&s;&s;ings: And tho' I think they may both be true, according to the Repre&s;entation I have made in this and other of the&s;e <HI>E&s;&s;ays</HI>; yet we have no great Rea&s;on to be fond of either of the&s;e Terms, e&s;pecially when they are made a Matter of Controver&s;y, becau&s;e they are neither of them the Expre&s;&s;ions of Scripture, which is our &s;upreme Rule of In&s;truction in the Matters of our Salvation.</NOTE> to receive <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Grace, he cannot argue that it does not &s;ave us, as it is a <HI>Condition,</HI> or a <HI>Term</HI> of our being accepted of God thro' him; or if another &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>Faith</HI> &s;aves us, as it is a <HI>laying hold</HI> of his Per&s;on, or as a <HI>Bond of Union</HI> between <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and us, yet he cannot argue, therefore <HI>Faith</HI> does not &s;ave us, as it is a <HI>Looking</HI> or <HI>Seeking to him</HI> from afar off, or as it is a <HI>Calling upon</HI> the Name of the Lord.</P>
<P>God has been plea&s;ed in many Ways to manife&s;t the&s;e mo&s;t important Things of our Salvation, and revealed them to us in a variety of human Expre&s;&s;ions, Similitudes, Actions and Relations, that the poore&s;t and the weake&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> might have Support and Encouragement for his Hope.</P>
<P><HI>Conclu&s;ion:</HI> 'Tis confe&s;&s;ed, that the&s;e Thoughts are not &s;ufficiently dige&s;ted into perfect Form, nor put toge|ther with all that Accuracy as Theological Controver&s;ies require; but my Sen&s;e and Meaning in them is pretty obvious and evident: Perhaps this De&s;ign might be more improved and promoted much farther by a wi&s;er Head, and a better Pen; and it might a&s;&s;i&s;t the Solu|tion of many Difficulties, and relieve the Quarrels and Contentions of different Parties to a greater degree; for 'tis evident, that the Characters which our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord &s;u&s;tains, and the Exerci&s;es of our Faith on him are very various, and we are made Partakers of this Salvation,

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>CHARITY in the Soul of Man is the very Picture of the God-head, taken as it &s;tands in the faire&s;t Light. Wi&s;dom and Holine&s;s, Power, Sovereignty and Ju&s;tice are various Features of the Deity:
<PB N="193" REF="006440_0208_1028F12A9B8D5070">
They are indeed his very Nature and E&s;&s;ence; yet the Scripture rather chu&s;es to expre&s;s, that <HI>God is Love,</HI> and that twice in one Chapter, 1 <HI>John</HI> iv. 8, and 16. The beloved Di&s;ciple that lean'd on the Bo&s;om of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> took peculiar Delight in the Contemplation of God, under this Character. This appears in his Go&s;pel as well as in his Epi&s;tle. The other Glories of that infinite Beauty &s;hine with awful Beams, and com|mand my Reverence: But methinks, I love to look upon &s;o glorious a Being in his mo&s;t conde&s;cending Air, and to conver&s;e with him in his milde&s;t and mo&s;t inviting A&s;pect.</P>
<P>Charity in Man is a Grace of that alluring Sweetne&s;s, that my Pen would fain be attempting to &s;ay &s;omething in Favour of it: I find a &s;trange Plea&s;ure in di&s;cour&s;ing of this Virtue, hoping that my very Soul may be moulded into its Divine Likene&s;s. I would always feel i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> inwardly warming my Heart.

I would dre&s;s my &s;elf in it as my be&s;t Raiment, I would put it on upon my Faith and Hope, not &s;o as entirely to hide them, but as an upper and more vi&s;ible Ve&s;ture, con&s;tantly to appear in among Men. For our <HI>Chri&s;tian Charity,</HI> is to evidence our other Virtues.</P>
<P>Uncharitablene&s;s is a loath&s;om Part of the Image of the fallen Angel: It is akin to the Hatred of God. <HI>For he that loveth not his Brother whom he hath &s;een, how can he love God whom he has not &s;een?</HI> 1 John iv. 20. He that hates his Fellow-Chri&s;tian, and brings railing Accu&s;ations again&s;t him for a Difference in little Qpi|nions, how can he expect to be beloved of God, who beholds in the be&s;t of us &s;o many mon&s;trous Follies, and Guilt of a more aggravated Nature? By the Word <HI>Uncharitablene&s;s</HI> here, I would not include our Neglect

of Charity to the Poor and Hungry, nor our Aver&s;ion to Errors of the gro&s;&s;er kind, but I mean our Aver&s;ion to &s;uch Per&s;ons who not only profe&s;s to be <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> but who al&s;o agree with us in the chief Doctrines of <HI>Chri&s;tianity, (viz.</HI>) the Pardon of our Sins by the aton|ing Sacrifice of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and the Sanctification of Men by the powerful Operations of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> and the Nece&s;&s;ity of Faith in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and Good Works, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I mean our Aver&s;ion to tho&s;e who differ from us in little Punctilios of Doctrine or Duty which are not ex|pre&s;ly and plainly written in the New Te&s;tament; tho&s;e who maintain &s;uch an Aver&s;ion to their fellow Chri&s;tians, as to pronounce Damnation upon them, or &s;ome terrible and unchri&s;tian Cen&s;ures, becau&s;e they do not come up to our Sentiments and Practices in things which are of little Moment, while we agree in all fundamental Points, and &s;uch as are of mo&s;t Importance.</P>
<P>This <HI>Uncharitablene&s;s</HI> is a Vice attended with &s;uch a Train of Mi&s;chiefs, that I would &s;et all my bigge&s;t Powers in Array to fight again&s;t it.

<HEAD><HI>SECT. I.</HI> The Cau&s;es of Uncharitablene&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>An Uncharitable Humour &s;prings generally from &s;ome of the&s;e following Cau&s;es.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> From <HI>a malicious Con&s;titution of Nature, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> acrimonious or a cholerick Temper of Blood.</HI> There are &s;ome Animal Engines of human Fle&s;h, that have their Juices all &s;our'd in their very Formation; and there is
<PB N="195" REF="006440_0210_1028F12F24734C80">
an ill Ferment rai&s;ed in &s;uch Per&s;ons at the Perception of every Object, that is not ju&s;t &s;uited to their pre&s;ent Fancy and Inclination: And by the hard Laws of Union between Soul and Body in this our fallen State, the Spirit too often complies with the fretful Di&s;tem|pers of the Fle&s;h. There are but few that attempt to &s;uppre&s;s the Ferment, and to re&s;i&s;t the angry Motions of the Animal; and of tho&s;e few that attempt it, &s;carce one in ten is very &s;ucce&s;sful: For 'tis a Work of Toil, and Difficulty, perpetual Watchfulne&s;s and uncea&s;ing Prayer.</P>
<P>This ill Humour mixes it&s;elf with Religion, as well as with Civil Affairs. It diffu&s;es its Malignity thro' all the Studies and the Manners of the Man, and gives a vi&s;ible Tincture to his Notions and his Practices. <HI>Furio</HI> can never conver&s;e about the calme&s;t and mo&s;t &s;pecula|tive Points of Divinity, but his Indignation kindles again&s;t every different Opinion, his fiery Temper breaks out and blazes, and he be&s;tows on his own De|portment the honourable Names of &s;hining Light and burning Zeal. His peevi&s;h and angry Pa&s;&s;ions are &s;o blended with his Under&s;tanding, that hard Names are his be&s;t Arguments; mo&s;t convincing to him&s;elf, tho' they are the ju&s;t Scorn of the wi&s;e. He &s;tabs his Brethren that differ from him to the Heart, with pointed Railing; and from an Aver&s;ion to an Opinion ri&s;es to an immortal Hatred of the Per&s;on. If our great Creator has untied any of our Souls to Bodies that are le&s;s infected with this vicious Juice, we have Rea&s;on to adore his Sovereign Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Self-Love and Pride, and a vain Conceit of our own Opinions,</HI> is another Spring of uncharitable Carriages. Did you ever &s;ee a weak and humble Soul &s;en&s;ible of its own Poverty and Ignorance, and ready to e&s;teem others above him&s;elf, ea&s;ily indulge this uncharitable Humour? Alas! poor fooli&s;h Mankind is very prone
<PB N="196" REF="006440_0211_1028F131AA99AF78">
to e&s;teem it&s;elf Wi&s;e and Knowing. Little <HI>Laudillus,</HI> who is almo&s;t always in the wrong, has much ado to per&s;wade him&s;elf, that he was ever capable of mi&s;taking. He &s;ecretly thinks all his Opinions to be divine Truths, and therefore he is very lavi&s;h in pronouncing Error and Here&s;y upon every Notion and Practice that dif|fers from his own. He takes the Freedom to chu&s;e a Religion for him&s;elf, but he allows no Man be&s;ides the &s;ame Liberty. He is &s;ure that he has Rea&s;on to di&s;|&s;ent from others, but no Man has Rea&s;on to di&s;&s;ent from him. He &s;ets up for Infallibility without a Triple Crown, and fixes a See of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Sovereignty on this Side the Water. He awes &s;ome &s;lavi&s;h Spirits into Submi&s;&s;ion, and they become treacherous to their own Souls and to the Rights of Human Nature, by delivering up their Faith and Con&s;ciences to his impe|rious Dictates: Then the Man grows haughty, &s;urly and &s;evere, e&s;pecially if he be advanced to any degree of Honour and Authority in the Church: Then in his inflexible Ju&s;tice he delivers up the humble and in|qui&s;itive Chri&s;tian unto <HI>Satan,</HI> becau&s;e he can't <HI>a&s;&s;ent and con&s;ent to all and every thing contain'd</HI> in his Scheme; and he teaches perhaps his elder Brethren the Doc|trines and Di&s;cipline of the Go&s;pel, as <HI>Gideon</HI> did the Elders of <HI>Succoth,</HI> with the Briars and Thorns of the Wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">III. This hateful Vice may be derived from a third Original; and that is a <HI>con&s;tant and friendly Acquaintance with the Men and Books of our own Opinion,</HI> and <HI>an Avoidence of all the Writers and Per&s;ons that differ from us:</HI> This has a mighty Influence to beget and main|tain uncharitable Notions; yet this is the con&s;tant Practice, not only of the unlearned, but of too many of the learned World. <HI>Hermes</HI> &s;its all the Year in his own Cell, and never looks abroad beyond the Clan of his own Fraternity: <HI>Hermes</HI> reads the Controver&s;ies

as they are de&s;cribed only by one Party, and di&s;putes them over only in the Books that are written on one Side. He finds a great Appearance of Argument and Scripture there, and then proclaims it impo&s;&s;ible that the adver&s;e Party &s;hould &s;hew equal Rea&s;on or Reve|lation: And thus he proceeds to cen&s;ure them as <HI>Men of corrupt Minds, reprobate concerning the Faith,</HI> and <HI>twi&s;t|ing the Scriptures to their own Damnation. Cicero</HI> in his Treati&s;e <HI>De natura Deorum,</HI> marks this Humour, and brands it, <HI>Ve&s;tra &s;olum legitis, ve&s;tra amatis, caeteros cau&s;a incognita condemnatis</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> read only your own Books, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">u love only your own, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> con|demn others before you know any &s;ufficient Rea&s;on, for want of knowing their Opinions.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But let you and I, my Friend, who delight in Charity, let us conver&s;e a little with Authors that differ from our pre&s;ent Opinions, and we &s;hall &s;ee their Sentiments dre&s;t up &s;o plau&s;ibly, and &s;et in &s;o fair a Light, that might ea&s;ily per&s;wade Men of &s;incere Con&s;ciences to embrace them; and this will prevent us from cen|&s;orious Thoughts concerning our candid Adver&s;aries, and their Di&s;ciples. There is &s;carce any thing that en|larges the Mind more, and more di&s;engages it from narrow and &s;elfi&s;h Principles, than a free Conver&s;e with the Virtuous and Ingenious of all Parties.</P>
<P>There is a memorable Story to this Purpo&s;e, con|cerning two Neighbours in an un&s;ociable Town, who were always quarrelling about the private Meeting and the Pari&s;h-Church: Both Places of Wor&s;hip in that Town were well &s;upplied with Preachers of good Sen&s;e and &s;erious Religion; but each of them was the Subject of unmerciful Reproach between the&s;e two Neigh|bours, when&s;oever they met, and their different Methods of Wor&s;hip were mutually reviled; the one as formal and &s;piritle&s;s, the other as enthu&s;ia&s;tical and indecent: At la&s;t <HI>Pacifico</HI> their common Friend per|&s;waded
<PB N="198" REF="006440_0213_1028F136F4D48D28">
them to hear each others Mini&s;ter, and accom|panied them both one Day to their different A&s;&s;em|blies; and they were both &s;urprized to hear the Go&s;pel preached with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> due Degree of Decency and Fervour, both at Meeting and at Church: And though they con|tinued &s;till to adhere to their own Party, as judging it, in &s;ome Re&s;pects, &s;uited be&s;t to their Edification; yet they maintained hearty Friend&s;hip with each other, and delightful Society in religious Conference: Thus the quarrel&s;om Mi&s;take was rectify'd by better Ac|quaintance: They lived many Years together in Peace; they compos'd the Animo&s;ities of different Parties, that dwelt in the Town; they died in perfect Charity, and left a &s;weet Influence behind them, and an honourable Example.</P>
<P N="4">IV. A <HI>Fourth</HI> Spring of Uncharitablene&s;s is, <HI>our read|ing the Word of God with a whole Set of Notions e&s;tabli&s;hed before-hand</HI>: And yet how common a Method, and how con&s;tant is this? <HI>Diaecion</HI> has long ago determined, that Bi&s;hops mu&s;t be &s;uperior to Presbyters; he has re|ceived Ordination from Epi&s;copal Hands; and hopes one Day him&s;elf to be capable of ordaining others. Thus while he is growing up towards the Mitre, he reads the Scriptures only to confirm his own determin'd Opinions. He &s;tretches and torments many an un|willing Text, to make it &s;peak the Language of his own Thoughts. He neglects the Pa&s;&s;ages that favour all other Forms of Government and Methods of Mi|ni&s;tration; or el&s;e he con&s;trains them to mean Epi&s;co|pacy too: Every Word that he reads, hath a <HI>Dioce&s;an</HI> A&s;pect; and the fir&s;t Ver&s;e of <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> can prove Pre|lacy (for ought I know) as it has been able heretofore to demon&s;trate <HI>Papacy,</HI> when <HI>In principio creavit Deus coelum &amp; terram,</HI> decided the Controver&s;y, and &s;et the <HI>Pope</HI> above the <HI>Emperor</HI>: For God made all things from one Beginning, and not from two.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="006440_0214_1028F13884AFEF98"><HI>Synodias</HI> reads the Bible with a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Gla&s;s, and <HI>Fratrio</HI> with a Congregational Optick: They can find nothing there but their own Opinions, and both of them wonder that <HI>Diaecion</HI> &s;hould not &s;ee them too. <HI>Fratrio</HI> turns over the Scriptures with great Diligence and Meditation, and as often as he finds the Word <HI>Church</HI> there, he thinks of nothing but a Congregation of faithful Men; as the Church of <HI>Jeru&s;alem, Alexandria,</HI> and <HI>Antioch</HI> are &s;o many &s;ingle Congregations. When <HI>Synodias</HI> meets the &s;ame Word in his Bible, he is often in the mid&s;t of an A&s;&s;embly of Divines; and e&s;pecially when any Power is attributed to the Church, he is &s;ure it mu&s;t intend a Cla&s;&s;is of Presbyters, or Con&s;i&s;tory of Elders. When the &s;ame Word falls under the Eye of <HI>Diaecion</HI> in his Cour&s;e of reading the New Te&s;tament, he cannot imagine any thing is meant &s;hort of a Dioce&s;s: All his Churches are or &s;hould be as big as Counties or Shires. And I might add, that when poor <HI>Parochianus</HI> the Ma&s;on finds Lei&s;ure to read a Chapter, and lights upon the mention of a Church in it, he thinks immedi|ately of a tall Stone-Building with a Steeple upon it, a Bell or two, and a Weather-cock.</P>
<P>I might give the like In&s;tances of many other Terms and Expre&s;&s;ions in Scripture, to which Men have un|alterably fixed their &s;everal different Ideas, and rais'd Con&s;equences from them, and interpret the Word of God by them, without enquiring whether their Ideas are conformable to the Sen&s;e in which the Scripture u&s;es tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions: and then 'tis no Wonder that their Schemes of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Government are &s;o dif|ferent: And yet each of the&s;e prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Opiniators think their own Expo&s;ition of the Text &s;o evident, that they chide the Perver&s;ene&s;s of all other Men, as though they were re&s;olved to wink again&s;t the Light. 'Tis like a Per&s;on of a fretful Con&s;titution, who&s;e Eyes are al&s;o tinged with the <HI>Jaundice,</HI> he quarrels with
<PB N="200" REF="006440_0215_1028F13BBA606988">
every Man that he meets, becau&s;e he will not con&s;ent to call all things yellow. Thus by the fal&s;e Light of Affection in which they behold &s;ome beloved Texts, and their Negligence of all others, or at lea&s;t by the Colours of Prejudice that they throw upon them, each triumphs in his own Sentiments, and pronounces the Apo&s;tles and Prophets of his Side. Then he lets fly many a &s;harp Invective again&s;t all the Men that pre|&s;ume to oppo&s;e him; for in his Sen&s;e they oppo&s;e the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves, and fight again&s;t the Authority of God.</P>
<P>But when a Man takes a Bible into his Hand without a pre-conceived Scheme in his Head, and though he may make u&s;e of Sy&s;tems to &s;ecure him&s;elf from In|con&s;i&s;tencies, yet he puts them not in the Place of the Holy Scriptures, but re&s;olves to form his Body of Di|vinity by the New Te&s;tament, and derive all his Opi|nions and Practices thence; he will then find &s;o many Expre&s;&s;ions that &s;eem to favour the &s;everal contending Parties of Chri&s;tians, that in &s;ome Points he will per|haps be tempted to doubt of all Opinions, and &s;ome|times have much ado to &s;ecure him&s;elf from the Danger of Eternal Sceptici&s;m: When in any doubtful Point his Judgment is led to a Determination, 'tis always with great Caution, and by &s;low Degrees: He is not carried by Violence to any Dogmatical Conclu&s;ion; he is mode&s;t in his A&s;&s;ertions, and gentle towards all who&s;e Judgment and Con&s;cience have determined them ano|ther Way, becau&s;e he met with &s;o many probable Ar|guments on their Side, in the Time of his Dubitation and Inquiry, that had almo&s;t fix'd his Opinion the &s;ame Way too.</P>
<P>If I may be permitted to &s;peak of my&s;elf, I might acquaint the World with my own Experience. After &s;ome Years &s;pent in the Peru&s;al of Controver&s;ial Au|thors, and finding them in&s;ufficient to &s;ettle my Judg|ment
<PB N="201" REF="006440_0216_1028F13FF477C340">
and Con&s;cience in &s;ome great Points of Religion, I re&s;olved to &s;eek a Determination of my Thoughts from the Epi&s;tles of Sr. <HI>Paul,</HI> and e&s;pecially in that weighty Doctrine of Ju&s;tification: I peru&s;ed his Letter to the <HI>Romans</HI> in the Original, with the mo&s;t fixed Meditation, laborious Study, and importunate Reque&s;ts to God, for &s;everal Months together: Fir&s;t without con&s;ulting any Commentator, and afterwards called in the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the be&s;t Criticks and Interpreters. I very narrowly ob&s;erved the daily Motions of my own Mind: I found it very hard to root out old Pre|judices, and to e&s;cape the Danger of new ones: I met with &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions of the Apo&s;tle that &s;way'd me towards one Opinion, and others that inclin'd the Balance of my Thoughts another way; and 'twas no ea&s;y Matter to maintain my Judgment in an equal Poi&s;e, 'till &s;ome ju&s;t and weighty Argument gave the Deter|mination; &s;o many cro&s;&s;ing Notions, perplexing Dif|ficulties and &s;eeming Repugnances lay in my Way, that I mo&s;t heartily ble&s;s the divine Goodne&s;s that enabled me at la&s;t to &s;urmount them all, and e&s;tabli&s;hed my Judgment and Con&s;cience in that glorious and for&s;aken Doctrine of the Ju&s;tification of a Sinner in the Sight of God, by the Imputation of a perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is not originally his own.</P>
<P>From my own Experiment I can ea&s;ily gue&s;s what confounding Intricacies of Thought others pa&s;s through in their hone&s;t Searches after Truth. The&s;e Conflicts did exceedingly enlarge my Soul, and &s;tretch'd my Charity to a va&s;t Extent. I &s;ee, I feel, and am a&s;&s;ured that &s;everal Men may be very &s;incere, and yet entertain Notions in Divinity, all widely different. I confe&s;s now and then &s;ome Opinions, or &s;ome unhappy Oc|currences are ready to narrow and confine my Affec|tions again, if I am not watchful over my&s;elf; but I pray God to pre&s;erve upon my Heart a &s;trong and
<PB N="202" REF="006440_0217_1028F142C5213B80">
la&s;ting Remembrance of tho&s;e Days and tho&s;e Studies, whereby he laid within me the Foundation of &s;o broad a Charity.</P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>Fifthly.</HI> Another Cau&s;e of Uncharitablene&s;s is a <HI>Want of Reflection on the Grounds of our own Opinions.</HI> We &s;hould be more ju&s;t to our&s;elves, and more gentle to others, if we did but impartially review the Rea&s;ons why we fir&s;t embraced our &s;everal Principles and Practices.</P>
<P>Perhaps 'twas Education determined mo&s;t of them, then let us chide our&s;elves &s;everely for building upon &s;o carele&s;s and &s;light a Bottom: Or let us be civil to the greate&s;t part of Mankind, who came by all their Principles the &s;ame Way. Perhaps we were led into particular Notions by the Authority of Per&s;ons whom we reverence or love; then we &s;hould not upbraid our Neighbours that have been influenced into different Sentiments by the &s;ame Springs. Perhaps we have felt Intere&s;t &s;ometimes ready to bya&s;s our Thoughts, and give us a &s;ecret Inclination or Aver&s;ion to a Party; let us then pity the Frailty of Human Nature, and have Compa&s;&s;ion upon Men who&s;e Judgments are ex|po&s;ed to &s;o mean a Bribery, and &s;ometimes have been warped a&s;ide from the Truth. Or finally, perhaps it was deep Meditation, a daily Search into Scripture, and fervent Prayer were the Methods by which we pur&s;ued Knowledge, and e&s;tabli&s;hed our Principles upon &s;olid Rea&s;on. Let us then be &s;o charitable to tho&s;e whom we contend with, as to &s;uppo&s;e they &s;ought after Truth the &s;ame Way, and then our Contentions will have le&s;s Fire and Spleen in them, le&s;s of Clamour and Indignation again&s;t tho&s;e that differ from us.</P>
<P>The true Rea&s;on why we kindle our Anger again&s;t our Chri&s;tian Brethren that are not intirely of our Party is, becau&s;e we not only have the Vanity to fancy our|&s;elves always in the Right, and them in the Wrong;
<PB N="203" REF="006440_0218_1028F1444FE179B8">
but we judge their Con&s;ciences and their Sincerity too, that they did not come hone&s;tly and fairly by their Principles, while we never con&s;ider how we our|&s;elves came by our own.</P>
<P N="6">VI. But there are &s;till more Ways to arrive at this Uncharitable Temper: I mu&s;t proceed to <HI>Sixthly</HI>; which is a common Method, and thus to be performed. If we will but <HI>trace the Principles of tho&s;e that di&s;&s;ent from us through all the Length of remote and feeble Con&s;e|quences, and be &s;ure to find &s;ome terrible Ab&s;urdity at the End of them,</HI> we &s;hall not ea&s;ily maintain our Charity. O how often do we put their Opinions upon the Rack! we torture every Joint and Article of them, 'till we have forced them to confe&s;s &s;ome formidable Errors which their Authors never knew or dream'd of: Thus the Original Notions appear with a frightful A&s;pect, and the Sectators of them grow to be the Ob|ject of our Abhorrence, and have forfeited their Right to every Grain of our Charity.</P>
<P><HI>Evangillo</HI> believes that <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI> has compleatly an&s;wered the Demands of the Law in order to our Ju&s;tification, and that in the room and &s;tead of all Believers. <HI>Nomineus</HI> hears this Doctrine, and thus be|gins his Chain of &s;evere and fal&s;e Deductions; then (&s;aith he) the Law has no Power to demand Obedience of us; then we are not to be charged with Sin, though we break the Law hourly and profanely; then we may contemn all the Commands, &s;port with the Threatnings, and defy God the Lawgiver and the Avenger. He proceeds then to pronounce <HI>Evangillo</HI> a wicked <HI>Antinomian,</HI> and in the Name of the Lord <HI>delivers him up to</HI> Satan, <HI>that he may learn not to bla&s;pheme. Evangillo,</HI> on the other Hand, (who has been well in&s;tructed in the Way of Salvation, and has learned the Duties of Faith and Hope, but is not yet &s;o well improved in the Charity of the Go&s;pel) hears <HI>Nomineus</HI>
<PB N="204" REF="006440_0219_1028F148AE99B3E8">
preaching up Repentance and &s;incere Obedience, as the Conditions of our Ju&s;tification and Acceptance with God to Eternal Life: He &s;mites his Brea&s;t with his Hand, and cries, Surely this Man knows no U&s;e of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in our Religion, he makes void his Righteou&s;ne&s;s and his Death, he is a mere Legali&s;t, a Papi&s;t, a rank <HI>Socinian,</HI> he <HI>preaches another Go&s;pel, and though he were an Angel from Heaven let him be accur&s;ed.</HI> Thus when Men dre&s;s up their Neighbours in all the &s;trained Con|&s;equences of their Opinions, with a malicious Plea&s;ure they pur&s;ue this Thread of Argument, they impo&s;e horrid Conclu&s;ions which can never be drawn from their Doctrines, and never leave the Pur&s;uit till they have pu&s;h'd each other to Bla&s;phemy and Damnation.</P>
<P>Whereas if the Doctrines and the Per&s;ons now men|tioned were put into the Ballances of Truth and Charity, perhaps the Principles of <HI>Evangillo</HI> would be found to have mo&s;t Weight of Scripture on their Side, and <HI>Nemineus</HI> more of the fair Shews of Rea&s;oning; But neither the one would be found to throw <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> out of his Religion, nor the other to make void the Law: And both of their Lives would appear &s;hining in Ho|line&s;s, but that they want the bright Garments of Charity.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Let me name a <HI>Seventh</HI> Spring of this unchari|table Humour; and that is, <HI>when we magnify circum&s;tan|tial Differences into &s;ub&s;tantial ones, and make every Punc|tilio of our own Scheme a fundamental Point,</HI> as though all the Law and the Prophets hung upon it, as though it were the Ground and Pillar of all the Truth in the Go&s;pel. <HI>Crucius</HI> will not allow his di&s;&s;enting Neighbour to be a Member of the Chri&s;tian Church, becau&s;e he &s;eparates from the Modes of Wor&s;hip in the Church of <HI>England;</HI> he can't believe him to be a Friend to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> crucified, becau&s;e he refu&s;es to have his Child baptized with the airy Sign of the Cro&s;s. Again the

<P>In the &s;ame manner, <HI>Repentance, Faith</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> are three nece&s;&s;ary Graces or Virtues that go to make up a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI>; and I might cite &s;everal Texts of Scrip|ture, where each of the&s;e three are made nece&s;&s;ary to Chri&s;tianity.

<P>In Chri&s;tianity <HI>nothing avails but &s;uch a Faith as works by Love</HI> unto all Holine&s;s, <HI>Gal.</HI> v. 6. <HI>Repent and believe the Go&s;pel,</HI> was the fir&s;t preaching of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his Apo&s;tles, <HI>Mark</HI> i. 15. And in other Places, Faith is in|di&s;pen&s;ably coupled with Repentance, <HI>Acts</HI> iii. 19. xx. 21. Without Repentance our Sins will not be forgiven us. Without Faith in <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> we have no Intere&s;t in his Salvation. True <HI>Faith</HI> mu&s;t be &s;uch as <HI>purifies the Heart,</HI> Acts xv. 9. And produces Good Works as the nece&s;|&s;ary Evidences to prove our Faith true, <HI>James</HI> ii. 17, 18.</P>
<P>What a &s;trange &s;ort of mon&s;trous Chri&s;tian would this be, who pretended to much Faith, but had no Love nor Repentance? And as mon&s;trous would that Pre|tender be, who had Love or Repentance without Faith. As <HI>God hath &s;et the Members of the Body, every one of them as it hath plea&s;ed him,</HI> &s;o has he appointed <HI>Faith, Repen|tance</HI>
<PB N="210" REF="006440_0225_1028F1586BCDDA18">
and <HI>Love</HI> to fulfil their &s;everal Offices in the Chri&s;tian Life. What a Piece of Madne&s;s therefore is it, and high Incon&s;i&s;tency to &s;eparate tho&s;e Things which God hath joined in his Go&s;pel? or to preach or paraphra&s;e very long and talk very much upon e'er a one of the&s;e, &s;o as to hinder that due Re&s;pect that is to be paid to the other two?

Let us take heed therefore, le&s;t we give Occa&s;ion by any of our Di&s;cour&s;es to exalt one of the&s;e Virtues or Graces to the Prejudice of the re&s;t, for the utter Lo&s;s of either of them will de&s;troy all our Pretences to Chri&s;tianity.</P>

Natural Affections have no room in his Soul, 'tis too much Spiritualized with Opinions and Doctrines.

<P>If a Man does but profe&s;s every Tittle of his Creed, and believe ju&s;t as <HI>Stellino</HI> believes, he is declared fit for Holy Communion; and if he will but di&s;pute warmly for the hard Words that di&s;tingui&s;h his Scheme, and can pronounce <HI>Shibboleth</HI> well, he &s;hall not be ad|judged to Death or Damnation, but joined heartily to the Fellow&s;hip of the Saints, tho' his flaming Immora|lities proclaim him a Son of <HI>Satan: Satan</HI> him&s;elf has perhaps a more accurate and nice Skill of the Contro|ver&s;ies of Divinity, than the be&s;t of our Profe&s;&s;ors and Doctors have arrived at; but his Pride and Malice are Chains of Darkne&s;s, and make a Devil of him in &s;pite of all his Knowledge: Yet <HI>Stellino</HI> affects too near a Re&s;emblance to <HI>Lucifer,</HI> that fallen Son of the Morning.</P>
<P>Vices that are odious to human Nature, and wild Licentiou&s;ne&s;&s;es of a bitter Tongue which de&s;troy all civil Society, are very little Faults in his Opinion, when put into the Balance with Orthodoxy and Zeal.

<P>There is one <HI>Momus,</HI> who is well known in the World for a Per&s;on that is ready to find fault with the be&s;t of Men, and the be&s;t of Things, if he can &s;u&s;pect any thing which he imagines worthy of Blame in them.

<P>Let it be al&s;o particularly remarked, that as the&s;e Ver&s;es come in ju&s;t after the Apo&s;tle had been &s;peak|ing of the atoning <HI>Sacrifice for Sin,</HI> which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him|&s;elf offer'd, as a fulfilling of all typical Sacrifices and Atonements of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Law, <HI>c.</HI> ix. 10. he expre&s;&s;es this condemning Sentence in this Language, <HI>there is no more Sacrifice for Sin, i. e.</HI> if a Man renounces the Sa|crifice of Atonement which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> has made for Sin, there remains no more Sacrifice for him to tru&s;t in, or to hope for, <HI>but a certain fearful looking for of Judg|ment and fiery Indignation, which &s;hall devour the Adver|&s;aries.</HI> Thus it appears, that this wilful Sinner is con|demned for renouncing the only Method of Atonement provided for the Pardon of Sins, which it was one of the chief Glories of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion to reveal and e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>

<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Let <HI>Momus</HI> con&s;ider how gro&s;sly the Go&s;pel mu&s;t be perverted, when it is turned into &s;uch a Sen&s;e as the <HI>Galatians</HI> &s;eem to have been taught by the&s;e Trou|blers of their Church, v 7. it is &s;uch an Error as would have carried them again into <HI>Judai&s;m</HI> with all is <HI>Yokes of Bondage,</HI> would have obliged them <HI>to be Circumci&s;ed</HI> and to ob&s;erve the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Fe&s;tival <HI>Days, Months</HI> and <HI>Years,</HI> Gal. v. 2. Such an Error as &s;hews them to have
<PB N="216" REF="006440_0231_1028F167187B97E8" MS="y">
run back to the Ceremonies of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Law <HI>for Ju&s;tification</HI> and Acceptance with God, v. 4. Such an Error as gave occa&s;ion to the Apo&s;tle to charge them, if ye pur&s;ue it <HI>ye are fallen from Grace,</HI> i. e. from the Go&s;pel of Grace: And that <HI>Chri&s;t would profit them nothing, would become of no Effect to them.</HI> v. 2, and 4.</P>
<P>And after all it mu&s;t be &s;aid the&s;e are the Words of Scripture, and of the Spirit of God, and not merely of St. <HI>Paul</HI> him&s;elf as a private Writer; and will the Man deal thus with Scripture? You &s;ee to what Lengths this Temper will carry a Man.</P>
<P>But &s;till he pur&s;ues his Accu&s;ation again&s;t the Apo&s;tles, and makes St. <HI>John</HI> to be gro&s;sly guilty of want of Charity in his 2d <HI>Epi&s;tle</HI> v. 9, 10. <HI>If there come any unto you and bring not this Doctrine,</HI> i. e. <HI>The Doc|trine of Chri&s;t</HI> mention'd in the foregoing Ver&s;e, <HI>receive him not into your Hou&s;e, nor bid him God Speed; for he that hiddeth him God &s;peed, if Partaker of his evil Deeds.</HI></P>
<P>Now to an&s;wer the unrea&s;onable Cen&s;ure of this <HI>Momus,</HI> let us enquire what this <HI>Doctrine of Chri&s;t</HI> is; and where &s;hould we find the mo&s;t important Parts of it but in the &s;ame Writer? Chap. i. v. 7. <HI>The Blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t clean&s;eth us from all Sin.</HI> Chap. ii. v. 2. <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Righteous is not only our Advocate with the Father, but he is al&s;o the Propitiation for our Sins,</HI> Chap. iv. 10. <HI>God loved us and &s;ent his Son to be the Pro|pitiation for our Sins,</HI> and that every true Chri&s;tian <HI>is born of God,</HI> Chap. v. 1, 4. <HI>i. e.</HI> as other Ver&s;es of this holy Writer in his Go&s;pel explain it, he is <HI>born of the Spirit</HI> of God, <HI>John</HI> i. 13, and iii. 5, 6.</P>
<P>It appears then that the Errors of &s;uch whom the Apo&s;tle would here exclude from our Friend&s;hip, are &s;uch as do not acknowledge <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> to be the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> or not to be a <HI>propitiatory Sacrifice for the Sins of Men,</HI> nor allow that every true Chri&s;tian is regene|rated and <HI>born of God,</HI> or <HI>of his Spirits, i. e.</HI> by the power|ful,
<PB N="217" REF="006440_0232_1028F168A1B21D28">
renewing and &s;anctifying Influences thereof as other Scriptures explain it, particularly <HI>John</HI> i. 12, 13. <HI>John</HI> iii. 3, 5. and as St. <HI>Paul</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, Eph. i. 19, 20. <HI>By &s;uch a mighty Power which he wrought in Chri&s;t when he rai&s;ed him from the Dead.</HI></P>
<P>Again, I would ask <HI>Momus,</HI> why are the Names of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> appointed &s;o generally to be u&s;ed in Bapti&s;m, which is the Ordinance which initiates us into Chri&s;tianity? Is it not to put us in Mind that when we profe&s;s Chri&s;tianity we profe&s;s the chief Ar|ticles that relate to him as our Saviour, (<HI>viz.) Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> to be the Propitiation for our Sins, we profe&s;s to be <HI>born of the Spirit,</HI> or regenerated and renewed to Holine&s;s by the Spirit of God? Now if a Man a&s;&s;erts him&s;elf to be a Chri&s;tian, when he believes and pro|fe&s;&s;es neither of the&s;e Doctrines, then St. <HI>John</HI> may be to blame indeed in denying the Benefit of common Chri&s;tian Friend&s;hip to &s;uch a Man.</P>
<P>But whither would this <HI>Momus</HI> lead us? What? would he make a Chri&s;tian out of &s;uch Adver&s;aries to the Name and Go&s;pel of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as neither tru&s;t in him as a Propitiation for their Sins, nor hope to be renewed and made holy by the Holy Spirit of God?</P>
<P>Let us learn of the <HI>Heathen</HI> Poet,
<Q>E&s;t modus in rebus, &s;unt certi denique fines.</Q></P>
<P>There mu&s;t be &s;ome Mea&s;ures and Bounds &s;et to every general Virtue, and even to <HI>Chri&s;tian Charity</HI> it&s;elf. This does not extend to Infidels in the &s;ame Sen&s;e. Surely, there mu&s;t be due Limits &s;et to every thing of this kind: They can &s;carce be ju&s;tly called <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and treated <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> let their Profe&s;&s;ion be what it will, who renounce <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> in his chief De&s;ign of coming into the World, as a Propitiation for Sin, and who renounce the Spirit of God as the effec|tual
<PB N="218" REF="006440_0233_1028F16BEAF71D70">
Spring of our Regeneration and Holine&s;s. If all <HI>Dei&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Infidels</HI> may be received into the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Church, into our good E&s;teem and Friend&s;hip, tho&s;e may al&s;o be our fellow Chri&s;tians who deny the mo&s;t important Principles of Chri&s;tianity: But let us take heed that we do <HI>not give that which is holy to &s;uch who have no claim to it,</HI> and give Charity and Chri&s;tian Friend&s;hip to tho&s;e, who &s;eem, according to the Word of God, to have no Pretence to it.</P>
<P>It has been <HI>objected</HI> indeed again&s;t this &s;econd as well as again&s;t the <HI>third Epi&s;tle</HI> of St. <HI>John,</HI> that they have not &s;ufficient Proof of their divine Original: Now it would be too large in this Place to enter into a di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of that Que&s;tion: But there is nothing &s;aid in this Epi&s;tle that is di&s;agreeable to the Sen&s;e of other holy Writers in other parts of Scripture; and by our Prote&s;tant Writers the&s;e Epi&s;tles have been generally repre&s;ented as part of the Word of God in the New Te&s;tament: Nor can I find &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to reject it, merely becau&s;e &s;ome Per&s;ons that need a more abundant Mea&s;ure of Indulgence and of Charity than the Scripture &s;eems to allow, will not allow it this po&s;t of Honour, and that is becau&s;e it excludes them from our Good E&s;teem, from <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Communion and Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Yet after all this Cen&s;ure of <HI>Momus</HI> and his Followers, if any &s;uch there be, I would &s;till hope and per&s;wade my&s;elf, there are &s;ome &s;erious and pious Souls who have been hone&s;tly &s;eeking after the Truths of Re|ligion, and &s;earching the Word of God to find them, who may have indulged &s;ome uncautious and unhappy Hour, wherein they have &s;uffered them&s;elves to be led away into this great Snare and Temptation of the evil One; &s;o that they have begun to doubt of this ble&s;&s;ed Doctrine of the atoning Sacrifice for Sin by the Blood of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> though it is &s;o &s;trongly, &s;o expre&s;ly,

<P>'Tis my &s;incere and earne&s;t De&s;ire, that God would &s;peedily break the&s;e unhappy Snares, what&s;oever they are, by which their Thoughts have been captivated into &s;o dangerous a Mi&s;take, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> ii. 25, 26. that he would plea&s;e to open the Eyes of their Mind by his inlightening Grace, that they may not run on &s;o far in this way as to be expo&s;ed to the Lo&s;s of the Benefit of this only Propitiation for Sin, and lay them&s;elves open to that &s;evere Sentence of the Word of God, that <HI>there remains no further</HI> propitiatory <HI>Sacrifice for them, but a certain fearful Expectation,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Heb.</HI> x. 26, 27.

<HEAD><HI>SECT. III.</HI> The mi&s;chievous Effects of Uncharitablene&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>Now if we have not dwelt too long on this Subject, (<HI>viz.</HI>) in tracing out this Mi&s;chief through its &s;everal <HI>Springs</HI> and <HI>Properties,</HI> and if my Reader be not quite out of Breath, I would ask him to take another Turn with me and walk down to a &s;hort Survey of the &s;ame Vice in its <HI>mi&s;chievous Effects</HI>; that we may be more warmly animated to pur&s;ue this Iniquity to the Death: If it were po&s;&s;ible, we would leave it neither Root nor Branch, Name or Memory in the Chri&s;tian World.</P>
<P N="1">I. The fir&s;t and mo&s;t obvious Mi&s;chiefs I meet with among Chri&s;tians of an uncharitable Humour, are the
<PB N="220" REF="006440_0235_1028F16F1DFF17A8">
con&s;tant Di&s;quiet of their own Spirits, the Vexation they give their Neighbours, the Injury they do to their own Edification, and to the Edification of all that conver&s;e with them.</P>
<P><HI>Singulario</HI> has a Sett of Notions and Rules whereby he adju&s;ts his own Creed and his Practice; and what|&s;oever he hears in Religious Conference, or in publick Duty, that does not preci&s;ely &s;quare to his Model, di&s;|quiets his Ears, di&s;reli&s;hes with his Ta&s;te, di&s;turbs his Con&s;cience, and thus prevents all the Benefit that his Soul &s;hould receive from the Di&s;cour&s;e, or Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>I grant it very lawful for a Man to be di&s;gu&s;ted with a Sermon, where the greate&s;t part is &s;pent in Notions contrary to his Judgment, and dre&s;t up in Language very foreign to his u&s;ual way of Conver&s;e about divine Things; this is &s;hocking to the Spirit of the be&s;t Chri&s;tians, and the Con&s;cience is &s;o nau&s;eated with the large&s;t part of the Entertainment that his Soul cannot be nouri&s;hed, and 'tis proper for him to forbear Attendance upon &s;uch a Preacher, and chu&s;e one more &s;uited to the Temper of his own Spirit. But <HI>Singulario</HI> hath an Aver&s;ion to a whole Hour's Di&s;cour&s;e, becau&s;e there were three Sentences of a Strain different from his Opinion. He reaps no Ble&s;|&s;ing from a Sermon of excellent Compo&s;ure, of divine Materials, of an evangelick Frame and ju&s;t Method, becau&s;e there's one Expre&s;&s;ion in it that is the Characteri&s;tick of another Sect. He &s;its unea&s;y un|der a noble Di&s;cour&s;e of Ju&s;tification or of Faith, becau&s;e (it may be) the Mini&s;ter doth avoid the Terms <HI>Imputed, Meritorious, Condition,</HI> and <HI>In&s;trument</HI>; and mentions none of the tortured Words of Noi&s;e and Party.</P>
<P>I will not indeed commend a Preacher that is al|ways affecting to di&s;gui&s;e his own Opinions, and for ever hiding him&s;elf in ambiguous Language, and that
<PB N="221" REF="006440_0236_1028F17409DA79E8">
in Points of Moment, thereby to maintain the ever|la&s;ting Applau&s;e of all Sides. But I mu&s;t chide <HI>Sin|gulario</HI> for the wry Faces he makes at Church when he hears but a Word or two of contrary Sound, or when his Ears mi&s;s and long for a Sett of darling Phra&s;es.</P>
<P>Three Years ago I was in Company with <HI>Achari&s;&s;a,</HI> a &s;our old Chri&s;tian of a very narrow Spirit, and gave her a gentle Admonition for the frequent Reproaches &s;he ca&s;t on the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> that did not preach exactly according to her Humour; I blamed that pe|tulant Liberty which &s;he took with all her Neighbours and Acquaintance, to cen&s;ure them &s;everely for every le&s;&s;er Difference of Practice or Wor&s;hip: I recom|mended to her reading that valuable Sermon of the Reverend Dr. <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> again&s;t Evil-&s;peaking; but I could not per&s;wade her to peru&s;e tho&s;e few Pages, not only becau&s;e of that &s;trong Propen&s;ity &s;he had to &s;peak Evil of others, but becau&s;e 'twas the Work of an Arch-Bi&s;hop; <Q>which &s;ort of Office, &s;aid &s;he, is a mere Human Invention, and the Scripture knows it not.</Q> I know another Name which has the &s;ame narrow Spirit. <HI>Sequilla</HI> hath ever given up the Conduct of her Soul to the Curate of her Pari&s;h, and after many Years Attendance on his Mini&s;try, in great Security of Con&s;cience, is well a&s;&s;ured that &s;he &s;hall go to Heaven at la&s;t. Perhaps by &s;ome terrible Pro|vidence, or by &s;ome plain Word of Scripture, &s;he is awakened to a deep and frightful Sen&s;e of Sin, and Danger of Eternal Death. She is vi&s;ited by the Cu|rate, and though he &s;aith &s;ome good things to her, yet &s;he finds not the Way of Peace. A kind Neigh|bour recommends to her &s;ome Book of Con&s;olation written by a Di&s;&s;enter, but &s;he refu&s;es the Book and the Comfort at once, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be guilty of that damnable Sin of Separation from the Church. <Q>How can I ever, &s;aid &s;he, expect the Peace of God from
<PB N="222" REF="006440_0237_1028F1766A19D500">
the Pen of a Schi&s;matick?</Q> And thus endures the Racks of Con&s;cience rather than &s;he will indulge Charity enough to hear of to read what a Nonconformi&s;t hath written.</P>
<P><HI>Presbycolo</HI> a Chri&s;tian of the &s;ame Stamp, heard a Sermon lately and commended it above mea&s;ure, con|fe&s;&s;ed how much Light and Love was kindled in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is Heart by it, and be&s;towed unu&s;ual Strains of Re&s;pect upon the Mini&s;ter: But <HI>Presbycolo</HI> (&s;aid I) <Q>This Man never had the Hands of a Bi&s;hop, or preaching Elder, laid upon his Head to ordain him.</Q> At once I &s;aw his Colour change, his Spirits &s;ink, and he concluded that all the divine Affections in his Soul under that Sermon mu&s;t needs be counterfeit, <Q>becau&s;e now I know (&s;aid he) the Preacher is no Mini&s;ter of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></Q> O the wretched Influence of this Vice of Uncharitablene&s;s upon feeble and deluded Souls! It proceeds &s;o far at la&s;t as to make Per&s;ons &s;crupulous of attending upon any Ordinance, le&s;t the Admini&s;tra|tor &s;hould not be a Man exactly of their Stamp. Thus their Hearts are vex'd with everla&s;ting Di&s;quiet, for they can hardly hear a Prayer, or an Exhortation, but they find &s;ome Offence in it; like a Man with a Thorn in his Hand, what&s;oever he takes hold of gives him Pain, but the Cau&s;e lies in his own Fle&s;h.</P>
<P>There are other In&s;tances of this Kind to be met with in the World. <HI>Nitidelli</HI> wears his Hair three Inches below his Shoulders, and 'tis ever well beautified with Powder: He frequently eats of a Di&s;h of Food where Blood is one of the Ingredients, and he often takes half a Pint of red Wine to his own Share: He maintains &s;erious Religion at Home and abroad: But <HI>Cen&s;orina</HI> cannot join with him in the &s;pecial Ordinances of Wor&s;hip. <Q>It is a &s;hame for him (&s;he cries) to wear long Hair; he is a Wine-bibber, and he ab|&s;tains not from Blood; nor can I be reconciled to
<PB N="223" REF="006440_0238_1028F178333B72B0">
him upon any Terms, unle&s;s he retrench the&s;e hor|rible Exce&s;&s;es.</Q> But he &s;till goes on carele&s;s and re|gardle&s;s of the Peace of his Fellow-Chri&s;tian, and &s;corns her little Clamours, rather than endeavours, by Gen|tlene&s;s and Compliance, to &s;atisfy or remove them. <HI>Now walke&s;t thou not charitably, O</HI> Nitidelli, <HI>for thou grieve&s;t thy Si&s;ter with thy Meat and Garments, for whom Chri&s;t died.</HI> But I would fain have <HI>Cen&s;orina</HI> learn al&s;o <HI>that the Kingdom of God is not Meat and Drink, but Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> Both of you therefore ought to <HI>follow after things which make for Peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.</HI> Rom. xiv. 15, 17, 19.</P>
<P>Nor is this Mi&s;chief confin'd to &s;ingle Per&s;ons: It makes a farther Progre&s;s &s;till, and infects the Neigh|bour and Acquaintance. Every <HI>Monday</HI> in the Even|ing <HI>Crites</HI> &s;its at the Head of a Club that meet toge|ther to arraign and &s;entence the Sermons of the fore|going Day. <Q>Did you mark, my Friends, &s;uch an Expre&s;&s;ion under the fourth Head? It &s;ounded har&s;h in my Ears. Surely the Man is not Orthodox; pray acquaint your Families of the Danger of his Opinions, and forbid their Attendance. Truly, re|plies <HI>Momion,</HI> he in&s;i&s;ted &s;o much on the Grace of God, that he left but one quarter of his Hour-Gla&s;s for the Duties of the Go&s;pel; I fear he's a <HI>Supralap|&s;arian,</HI> my Spirit ri&s;es again&s;t him, and I mu&s;t warn my Acquaintance of his Doctrine.</Q> A third Per&s;on in the Company begins to &s;urmi&s;e that his Morals are not good: <Q>I have heard an ill Story of a Preacher not long &s;ince, &s;aith he, and &s;urely this mu&s;t be the Man?</Q> And then he proceeds in a direct Oppo|&s;ition to the Grace of Charity, as it is de&s;cribed by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xii. 5. <HI>Tit.</HI> iii. 3. <Q>I ea&s;ily believe all that is evil of him; I am provoked at him; I hope no Good from him; I cannot bear his Principles; I

cannot endure his Per&s;on; and I &s;hould rejoice <HI>in the &s;ea&s;onable Death of &s;uch an Antinomian as this is.</HI></Q> Thus does the Root of Bitterne&s;s &s;pring up into wide Branches, it bears poi&s;onous Fruit, and many Souls are troubled. Ble&s;&s;ed be God who of late Years begins to purge out this &s;our Leaven from among&s;t us.</P>
<P N="2">II. The next pernicious Effect I take Notice of, is, that an <HI>uncharitable Carriage brings a Di&s;grace and Ble|mi&s;h upon Chri&s;tianity, beyond the Guilt and Scandal of</HI> Heatheni&s;m: 'Tis the Character of the Gentiles indeed, that they were <HI>hateful and hating one another</HI>; but not for different Principles of Philo&s;ophy which they pro|fe&s;s'd, nor different Methods of Wor&s;hip, which they paid to their Gods. There were no Civil Wars pro|claimed, nor Courts of Inqui&s;ition erected among&s;t them upon this Account, though their Controver&s;ies about divine Things were not trivial, and they differ'd widely in the very Foundations of Religion; and, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ingenious Author expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf on this Subject, <HI>Though Poets have made the Gods enter into Factions and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for Common-wealths, yet Common-wealths never did the &s;ame for their Gods.</HI></P>
<P>But if the Heathens had been never &s;o much en|raged, and quarrelled never &s;o fiercely for the &s;ake of Opinions, and Formalities; &s;till they were almo&s;t infinitely more excu&s;able than Chri&s;tians can pre|tend to be: For the very Doctrines of mo&s;t of their Sects permit Revenge; and they have many a bloody Principle among&s;t them. But Chri&s;tianity is the mo&s;t mild, the mo&s;t gentle, and the mo&s;t peaceable Religion: Never a Doctrine was taught among&s;t Mankind, that hath &s;o much of Love and Sweetne&s;s in it: Ne|ver a Sy&s;tem, or Rule of Duties, wherein Meek|ne&s;s and Candor, Charity and Compa&s;&s;ion are &s;o pre|&s;cribed, and inforced.</P>
<P>Never was there a Religion in&s;tituted by God or invented by Men, with &s;o much Goodne&s;s in the
<PB N="225" REF="006440_0240_1028F17E12EBFA98">
Heart and Soul of it, or &s;o many Charms and Amia|blene&s;&s;es in the Face. 'Tis built upon the Foundation of God's Eternal and Unchangeable Love. 'Twas Love that a&s;&s;umed Human Nature, and became the great Prophet and Teacher of it, and the Spirit of Love in our Hearts is its Vital Spring within us: 'Tis divine Love dwelling in Fle&s;h, hanging upon a Cro&s;s, bleeding, and dying for Enemies and Rebels, that hath purcha&s;ed all the promi&s;ed Ble&s;&s;ings of our Religion; and 'tis the &s;ame Love ari&s;ing from the Grave, and reigning in Glory, that di&s;tributes the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings to Men: And in all the melting Language of Compa&s;&s;ion and Ten|derne&s;s invites us to receive them: 'Twas this Love dwelling per&s;onally among&s;t Men, calls him&s;elf our Brother, and charges us to love all the Profe&s;&s;ors of the &s;ame Faith as Brethren: He requires that we &s;hould be ready to lay down our Lives for one another, as he did for us all: And orders it to be the di&s;tingui&s;hing Character of all his Followers, <HI>Hereby &s;hall all Men know, that ye are my Di&s;ciple, if ye love one another,</HI> John xiii. 34, 35.</P>
<P>God him&s;elf is infinite and un&s;een Love, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is Love incarnate and vi&s;ible: And a Chri&s;tian is or &s;hould be an Effigy of that Love graven to the Life, by the Finger of the divine Spirit. Now, for the Pro|fe&s;&s;ors of &s;uch a Doctrine to quarrel about Trifles, and grow malicious upon every Punctilio of different Sen|timents, how gro&s;ly do they abu&s;e the Chri&s;tian Name? They rob their own Religion of its due Honour among&s;t Men, and bring infinite Shame and Di&s;credit upon Chri&s;tianity in the Face of Infidel Nations. 'Tis for the &s;ake of this Madne&s;s which is found among&s;t the pretended Followers of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, his Name is bla&s;phemed among the Heathens; and the Conver|&s;ion of the Kingdoms of this World to the Faith of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> rendered almo&s;t rationally impo&s;&s;ible.</P>

It &s;its brooding over the Eggs of a Cockatrice, and daily &s;ends forth a fiery flying <HI>Serpent, In&s;truments of Cruelty are in its Habitation,</HI> and all its Children are Sons of Blood and Rapine.</P>
<P><HI>O my Soul, come thou not into their Coun&s;el; unto their A&s;&s;embly mine Honour be not thou united; for in their Anger they have &s;lain</HI> Millions of <HI>Men, and in their Self-will they have digged up</HI> the Foundations of a Thou&s;and Churches. <HI>Cur&s;ed be their Anger for it is fierce, and their Wrath for it is cruel.</HI> The&s;e Men of Divi&s;ion at the la&s;t Judgment Day, may ju&s;tly expect to be divided from <HI>Jacob,</HI> and to be &s;cattered far away from the <HI>I&s;rael</HI> of God. <HI>For God will render to every one according to their Works.</HI> And &s;urely the&s;e bloody Per|&s;ecutions are &s;uch Works as demand like Revenges from a God of Ju&s;tice; if &s;uch as practi&s;e them die without Repentance.</P>
<P>If you ask me the Method whereby this uncharita|ble Temper has advanced to &s;uch a Degree of Rage and Barbarity, 'tis very obvious and ea&s;y to be ex|plained. At fir&s;t the&s;e Men a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves the Name of the Church, and lodge in them&s;elves a Sort of Infallibility, or at lea&s;t pretend to a divine Autho|rity to determine finally all doubtful Ca&s;es of Religion, and to rule over the Con&s;ciences of Men. They &s;et up the wretched Trade of Creed-making, and demand the Belief of Mankind: Then they give out Decrees, &s;uch as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his Apo&s;tles never gave, and pro|nounce Damnation again&s;t all that doubt or disbelieve them; though their Fables are not cunningly devi&s;ed,
<PB N="227" REF="006440_0242_1028F181FABF2388">
becau&s;e they are made too big for Belief. Some of them contradict the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial Principles of Sen&s;e, Rea&s;on and Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>You will &s;ee this plainly exemplified in a few In|&s;tances I &s;hall give of their Decrees and Canons. As, <HI>Who&s;oever &s;hall affirm that there are more or le&s;s than &s;even Sacraments, let him be anathematiz'd, excommunicated, or accur&s;ed: Who&s;oever &s;hall affirm that the Sub&s;tance of Bread and Wine remains in the Euchari&s;t, together with the Body and Blood of</HI> Chri&s;t, <HI>or &s;hall deny the wonderful Change of the whole Sub&s;tance of Bread into Body, and Wine into Blood, which the Catholick Church calls Tran&s;ub|&s;tantiation, let him be excommunicated: Who&s;oever &s;hall &s;ay, that extreme Unction doth not confer Grace, nor remit Sin, nor ea&s;e the Sick, let him be excommunicated.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Canons of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> in the Council of <HI>Trent.</HI></NOTE> Thus oftentimes the &s;ame Anathema and eternal Death is denounced again&s;t &s;uch as di&s;obey their Decrees about Matters of trifling Importance; Matters which they them&s;elves can never pretend to be, in their own Na|ture, nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation. <HI>He that &s;hall &s;ay a common Mini&s;ter can confirm as well as a Bi&s;hop, let him be excom|municated: He that &s;hall &s;ay, the Ceremonies, the Ve&s;tments,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>in the Celebration of the Ma&s;s, are Incentives to Sin, rather than Duties of Piety, let him be excommunicated: He that &s;hall &s;ay, a Prie&s;t may become a Layman again, let him be excommunicated: And who&s;oever &s;hall &s;ay that the Hi|erarchy of Bi&s;hops, Presbyters, and Mini&s;ters or Deacons is not of Divine Ordination, let him be excommunicated.</HI></P>
<P>When this Church has thus excommunicated and cur&s;ed Chri&s;tians better than her &s;elf, and ca&s;t them out of her Arms, &s;he gives them up to the &s;e|cular Power, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the Hi&s;tory of the Inqui&s;ition.</NOTE> with an awful and deceitful Charge, that the ob&s;tinate Heretick &s;hall not be hurt in Life or Limb; but with a full De&s;ign that they &s;hould be tortured, and de&s;troyed.

them to the Devil in their Spiritual Courts, the tem|poral Executioner &s;ends them out of the World; not that their Souls may be &s;aved in the Day of the Lord, but that they may be plung'd immediately into utter Darkne&s;s, where <HI>Satan</HI> dwells.</P>
<P>'Tis the Command of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, by <HI>Paul</HI> the great Apo&s;tle, Rom. xiv. 1. <HI>That &s;uch as were weak in the Faith &s;hould be received to their Fellow|&s;hip, and not troubled with doubtful Di&s;putations,</HI> &s;uch as the Ob&s;ervance of Meats and Days, and Things of like Moment: But the <HI>Romans</HI> have now &s;o far re|bel'd again&s;t this Rule, as to admit Per&s;ons into their Communion upon no other Terms than a blind Submi&s;|&s;ion to all the doubtful Di&s;putables which that Church impo&s;es. They had an Order from St. <HI>Paul.</HI> Rom. xv. 7. <HI>to receive all &s;uch as Chri&s;t had received</HI>; and con&s;equently to reject no others but tho&s;e whom <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> rejects; but they forgot this charitable Canon of our Lord, while they receive Thou&s;ands to their Communion which have no vi&s;ible Marks of the Image of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and reject Thou&s;ands, and cur&s;e them to Hell, whom the Lord <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> will acknowledge for his, and pronounce them ble&s;&s;ed of his Father at the la&s;t Day.</P>
<P>When they fir&s;t begin to a&s;&s;ume this Sovereignty over Faith and Con&s;cience, they u&s;e a Shew of Ar|gument, and pretend to in&s;truct and enlighten the Weak and the Ignorant. They admoni&s;h them to hearken to the Church; but if the Ignorant are &s;till weak in Belief, and cannot be convinced of the Law|fulne&s;s of their Ceremonies, then they &s;end the Sheriff and the Jailor to carry on the Di&s;pute; a Pri&s;on and the Gibbet are the next Arguments; and when Rea&s;on and Scripture will not a&s;&s;i&s;t them, they employ Fire and Sword to <HI>contend earne&s;tly for the</HI> Fables <HI>that were</HI> never <HI>delivered to the Saints.</HI></P>
<P>To draw up an Account of the horrible Effects of
<PB N="229" REF="006440_0244_1028F1871B167A90">
Uncharitablene&s;s would be to tran&s;cribe the Eccle&s;ia&s;|tical Hi&s;tory of many Ages: Whole Churches and Quarters of the World, the Ea&s;tern and We&s;tern, have damned one another plentifully upon the Account of impo&s;ed Days, and Trifles which the Go&s;pel leaves in|different or rather forbids. How many of the Canons of ancient Councils have been influenc'd in their For|mation by this a&s;&s;uming Spirit, and as terribly enforced in their Execution to the Reproach and Deva&s;tation of <HI>Chri&s;tendom?</HI></P>
<P>But it moves my Grief and Wonder, that a modern Church that pretends not to Infallibility &s;hould a&s;&s;ume a &s;trange Dominion over our Faith and Practice. It a&s;&s;erts its own <HI>Power to decree Rites and Ceremonies, and Authority in Controver&s;ies of Faith</HI>; when in the very proceeding Words it confe&s;&s;es, that <HI>the Churches of</HI> Jeru&s;alem, Alexandria, <HI>and</HI> Antioch <HI>have erred, &s;o al&s;o the Church of</HI> Rome <HI>has erred, not only in their Living and Manner of Ceremonies, but al&s;o in Matters of Faith.</HI> It demands my Admiration, that &s;uch a Church &s;hould canonically denounce her Excommunications in abun|dance, again&s;t tho&s;e that di&s;&s;ent from her in &s;ome di&s;|putable Things, while they retain all her profe&s;&s;ed Doctrines of the Chri&s;tian Faith.</P>
<P>And 'tis a Pain and a Shame to our Eyes to look backward upon other Times, and to behold Pamphlets written again&s;t Toleration by &s;uch as are Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel of Peace, that perfect Law of Liberty. 'Twas their Opinion then, (and they told the World &s;o in Print) that <HI>Sectaries</HI> ought to the &s;ilenced by the Civil Power: Now <HI>Sectary</HI> is a Name of broad Dimen&s;i|ons, and has a terrible Stretch with it; the long Scourge would in Time reach all tho&s;e who differ from the Hand that manages that Weapon of Cha&s;ti&s;ement: None mu&s;t be authorized to preach in any Form, but by the Solemnity of impo&s;ing Hands, by a Company of
<PB N="230" REF="006440_0245_1028F188A8F33338">
authorized Men. Becau&s;e &s;ome &s;ubjected them&s;elves to the Determination of a Synod, they would make it the Duty of all their Neighbours to wear the &s;ame Yoke; and thought others were bound to become Slaves to the &s;ame Dictates. But I forbear this Charge, and almo&s;t wi&s;h it cancelled: For as the Magi&s;trate did not put in practice the uncharitable Pamphlets, &s;o tho&s;e Reverend and Honourable Writers have been taught to acknowledge the Mi&s;take of their Zeal, when their own verbal Rods have been turned again&s;t them, and became real Scorpions with Stings and Scourges a thou&s;and-fold. The Fathers have been dearly in&s;truc|ted in the Value of Toleration and Liberty by mo&s;t abundant Retaliations. The Children have learned to preach this Part of the Go&s;pel well, and I'm per&s;waded they'll never forget it again.</P>
<P>If we turn over more ancient Annals, the <HI>Marian</HI> Days give us horrible Examples of fiery Zeal in the Clergy, and the glorious Reign of the &s;ucceeding Virgin-Prince&s;s is hardly to be purged from the Stain of Blood. Ble&s;&s;ed be God who has put into the Heart of our Civil Governors to re&s;train the Fury of all Spi|ritual Admini&s;trators. The long and dreadful Train of Capias's and Goalers, Pri&s;ons and Plunderings, Ruin and Bani&s;hment, Silencings and violent Suppre&s;|&s;ions are no longer the Attendants of the Anathemas of any Church among us. And I hope no Church mourns the Lo&s;s of them; tho' there are &s;ome Ana|themas that abide &s;till as Terrors to tho&s;e that are weak in Faith, and not very honourable Monuments of that Church's Charity.</P>
<P>In the&s;e late Years the Scene of <HI>Great Britain</HI> was a little Shadow of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> where Dragoons and the Inqui&s;ition manage Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Di&s;cipline. We were brought to the very Gates of <HI>Aceldama.</HI> The Agents of <HI>Rome</HI> were ready with their In&s;truments of

Death. Adored be the Divine Spirit that awaken'd the Rulers of the Church to behold the common Danger, and rais'd in them generous Re&s;olutions and Promi&s;es to exerci&s;e Charity and Temper towards their Brethren. Glory to that God who&s;e kind Providence &s;ent us a Deliverer, and forbid <HI>England</HI> to become a Field of Blood and Matyrdom: And new Songs of Prai&s;e are &s;till due unto Divine Mercy, for e&s;tabli&s;h|ing the Per&s;on and Heart of our Queen in the Throne and the Principles of &s;o glorious an Example and Pre|dece&s;&s;or. Her gentle Government &s;ubdues the Hearts of all her People to her&s;elf; her Charity joins their Affections to one another; her parental Care and Love reconciles Chri&s;tian Parties, and her Wi&s;dom unites Chri&s;tian Nations.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The la&s;t Mi&s;chief I &s;hall mention, and which &s;hould fright us terribly from the Peril of it, is, that <HI>an uncharitable Man wounds the very Vitals of that Religion, by which be hopes for Eternal Life</HI>: And whil&s;t his Fury rages again&s;t his Brother for accidental Differences, he &s;hakes the very Foundations of his own Chri&s;tianity, and endangers or prevents his own Salvation; his boa&s;ted Orthodoxy in Opinion is made vain, while his practical Ungodline&s;&s;es are &s;o real; and his Faith ap|pears to be little better than that of Devils, when he mingles &s;o much of their Malice with it. In vain does he glory in the Brightne&s;s of his Notions; in vain doth he pre&s;ume <HI>Darkne&s;s is pa&s;t, and the true Light now &s;hineth: For he that &s;aveth he is in the Light and hateth his Brother, he abides in Darkne&s;s, even till now,</HI> 1 John ii. 8, 9.</P>
<P>Such a Wi&s;dom compo&s;ed of mere Opinion and Wrath can never lead aright up to Heaven, for it did not de&s;cend from thence: <HI>The Wi&s;dom that is from above is fir&s;t pure, then peaceable, gentle, ea&s;y to be in|treated, full of Mercy and good Fruits, without Partiality,
<PB N="232" REF="006440_0247_1028F18E77A387C0">
and without Hypocri&s;y, and the Fruit of Righteou&s;ne&s;s is &s;own in Peace of them that make Peace: But if ye have bitter Envying and Strife in your Hearts, glory not.</HI> What|ever your Pretences of Truth be, <HI>this is but lying again&s;t the Truth: This Wi&s;dom de&s;cendeth not from above, but is earthly, &s;en&s;ual, carnal, devili&s;h,</HI> Jam. iii. 14, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible there &s;hould be true Faith without &s;in|cere Love: <HI>If I under&s;tand all My&s;teries, and have all Knowledge, if I &s;peak with the Tongues of Men and Angels, and have all Faith, &s;o that I could remove Mountains, and mere de&s;titute of Charity, my Preten&s;ions to Religion are the mere Sound of noi&s;y Bra&s;s, or a tinkling Cymbal,</HI> 1 Cor. xiii. 1, 2. 'Tis &s;uch a Charity that <HI>&s;uffereth long, that is not ea&s;ily provoked, that beareth all things, and believeth all things,</HI> that taketh all Things in the be&s;t Sen&s;e, <HI>and thinketh no Evil:</HI> 'Tis &s;uch a Charity as this that is a &s;ub&s;tantial Part of our Religion. Charity in the Heart, is ab&s;olutely required to make up inward Chri&s;tianity; and the Appearance of it in the Life is a mo&s;t nece&s;|&s;ary Part of Godline&s;s.</P>
<P>'Tis true indeed, that all Graces and Virtues are very imperfect in this pre&s;ent State, and there is much of Uncharitablene&s;s remaining in many a good Man: But that Man can never be good that has no Charity. <HI>Zelotus</HI> has &s;pend his Life in declaiming again&s;t &s;ome little Modes and Ge&s;tures u&s;ed in Wor&s;hip by his Fel|low Chri&s;tians, or in impo&s;ing &s;ome unin&s;tituted Cere|monies on the Con&s;ciences of his Brethren. He hath &s;tir'd up the Magi&s;trate to per&s;ecute &s;ome of them to Pri&s;ons, and almo&s;t to Death. He flatter'd his Con|&s;cience with Hopes that his Zeal for the Church &s;hould not only render him acceptable at the la&s;t Day, but provide him a large Reward: He lies now langui&s;h|ing upon a Bed of Sickne&s;s, on the very Borders of Eternity, and is terribly awaken'd to behold his own Mi&s;take; while he &s;tands within Sight of the Tribunal
<PB N="233" REF="006440_0248_1028F191C7CBD1B0">
of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and the Face of the Judge, his former Prac|tice appears to his Con&s;cience in its true and frightful Shape; the Fire that hath animated him again&s;t his Brethren, now fla&s;hes in his Soul, and di&s;covers its in|fernal Source; now he dreads to be made an Example of the &s;ame Vengeance among Devils, with which he hath pur&s;ued his Fellow Mortals; he groans out his la&s;t Breath in bitter Agonies; cries to the God of Love for Mercy upon his departing Spirit; and expires al|mo&s;t without Hope. He is gone. But we leave his Soul to the Compa&s;&s;ions of a God who can better par|don his mighty Errors, than he would forgive others in their little Mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>Thus dreadfully hath this Vice of Uncharitablene&s;s prevailed again&s;t the Honour of Chri&s;tianity, and the Peace of Mankind. Thus &s;acrilegiou&s;ly hath it taken away one of the brighte&s;t Marks of the be&s;t Religion, and that is Love. It hath defaced the Beauty of our holy Profe&s;&s;ion, &s;candalized the &s;acred Name that we bear, made a Slaughter-hou&s;e of the Church of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and deceived the Souls of Men to their own eternal Ruin.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as I had fini&s;h'd this E&s;&s;ay, <HI>Phari&s;aino</HI> happened to come into my Study, and taking up the fir&s;t Leaf, read the Title, and was per&s;waded this Di&s;cour&s;e mu&s;t be written again&s;t him&s;elf.</P>

<P>IF the Scandal and Cruelty of an uncharitable Temper have not been de&s;cribed in Characters &s;ufficiently frightful, it mu&s;t be imputed to a Want of Skill in the Hand that attempted it, for there is no Want of formidable Features in the Vice it&s;elf. Perhaps a little and unknown Pen hath not Force enough to wage &s;ucce&s;sful War again&s;t this mighty Iniquity; and the Printer, in two or three vacant Pages, permits me to call in the Aid of &s;ome great and well known Names: Names who fought again&s;t it in their Lives, who being dead, yet &s;peak, and plead heartily that it may be de|&s;troyed. They e&s;pou&s;ed the Cau&s;e of Charity with a warm Zeal, being per&s;waded that it made a con&s;idera|ble Part of our Religion, and that the contrary Humour was de&s;tructive to all that is called Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>Since this Infection is not confined to one Party of Men, but hath &s;pread it&s;elf wide through all Chri&s;tian Societies among us, I have taken the Liberty in the foregoing Leaves to &s;trike at it where&s;oever I found it; and tho&s;e who hide this Venom in their Heart &s;till, to what&s;oever Tribe they belong, let them hear the Words of their dead Fathers: Let them blu&s;h at their own Folly, and no longer refu&s;e to be healed.</P>
<P>Archbi&s;hop <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> in his Works in Folio, Page 217, acquaints us that <HI>other Sects were di&s;tingui&s;hed by little Opinions, or by &s;ome external Rites and Ob&s;ervances in Religion; but our Saviour pitches upon that which is the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial, the mo&s;t large and exten&s;ive, the mo&s;t u&s;eful and beneficial, the mo&s;t human, and the mo&s;t divine Quality of which we are capable,</HI> and that is Love.

It will make you bold in bitter Invectives and Cen|&s;ures again&s;t tho&s;e that differ from them.

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. I.</HI> A Short Account of the&s;e Difficulties.</HEAD>
<P>COncerning the Doctrines and Duties which peculiarly belong to the New Te&s;tament, I have generally concluded this to be a good Rule of Judgment, that according to the Degree of their Importance or Nece&s;&s;ity to Salvation, &s;uch is commonly the Degree of their Evi|dence; and the Frequency of their Repetition is, for the mo&s;t part, proportionable to their U&s;efulne&s;s. Tho&s;e great Truths of our Religion, and tho&s;e Practices of Chri&s;tianity, without which we can't be &s;aved, are de&s;|cribed in the Word of God in large and fair Charac|ters, &s;o that <HI>he who runs may read them.</HI> The&s;e <HI>Vi&s;ions</HI> and Revelations of the Mind and Will of God our Sovereign, <HI>are written and made plain upon the Tables</HI> of the Evangeli&s;ts, or of the Apo&s;tles, <HI>Heb.</HI> ii. 2. they are not mentioned once and briefly, but many Pages explain and repeat them; they &s;tand in a divine and convincing Light, and may ea&s;ily be under&s;tood by tho&s;e who with a humble and teachable Spirit, inquire what they mu&s;t believe and do, in order to plea&s;e God.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="006440_0255_1028F1A45CC7EF68">This Remark is much confirmed by that Promi&s;e which a&s;&s;ures us that it &s;hould be &s;o in Go&s;pel-times. <HI>The High way</HI> to Heaven is &s;o <HI>plain, that the way-faring Men,</HI> or Strangers, <HI>though they be Fools</HI> in Under|&s;tanding, <HI>&s;hall not err therein,</HI> I&s;ai. xxxv. 8. A Man that labours in his daily Calling, in the City or the Field, or a Servant in the lowe&s;t Rank of Life, may, with due Application in their vacant Moments, be acquainted with the nece&s;&s;ary Truths and Duties of our Religion; be&s;ides that the Spirit of God is pro|mi&s;ed to &s;incere and diligent Seekers, to faithful and humble Inquirers, and &s;hall be be&s;towed &s;ufficiently to inform them of the &s;ure way to eternal Life, Prov. ii. 1.6. <HI>If thou crie&s;t after Knowledge, and lifte&s;t up thy Voice for Under&s;tanding, if thou &s;eeke&s;t her as Silver, and &s;earche&s;t for her as for hid Trea&s;ures,</HI> then <HI>&s;halt thou un|der&s;tand the Fear of the Lord, and find the Knowledge of God.</HI> Luke xi. 13. <HI>Your heavenly Father &s;hall give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him.</HI> And the Spirit is <HI>&s;ent to guide</HI> the Faithful <HI>into all Truth,</HI> John xvi. 13.</P>
<P>The Wi&s;dom, the Equity and the Goodne&s;s of God &s;eem all to concur in fixing Matters of nece&s;&s;ary Belief and Practice in this Situation, <HI>i. e.</HI> That they &s;hould be often and plainly expre&s;t. If there be any parti|cular Doctrine or Duty which I find written but in one &s;ingle Text of Scripture, or expre&s;t but darkly, I &s;hould rea&s;onably conclude the Great God never de&s;igned that Doctrine, or that Duty to be of very great Im|portance in the Chri&s;tian Life: For a dark Expre&s;&s;ion is much more ea&s;ily mi&s;taken, as to the true Sen&s;e of it; and a &s;ingle Text is more liable to be <HI>mi&s;copied,</HI> or <HI>dropt</HI> by a Tran&s;criber, or be <HI>mi&s;con&s;trued</HI> by a Tran&s;lator, or <HI>over&s;een and neglected</HI> by a common Reader or Hearer; and the Great God would not put Matters of high Im|portance on &s;o doubtful and dangerous a Foot, and leave Things nece&s;&s;ary at &s;uch Uncertainties, le&s;t hone&s;t

and humble <HI>Enquirers &s;hould,</HI> after all their Pains, mi&s;|take their Way to Heaven.</P>
<P>A &s;udden Thought of the <HI>Form and Order of Bapti&s;m,</HI> pre&s;cribed to us, <HI>Matth.</HI> xxviii. 18. made me at fir&s;t &s;u&s;pect, that there mu&s;t be one Exception made to this Rule, about the frequent Repetition of any Doctrine or Duty nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation; but upon a further Con|&s;ideration and Review of Things it appears evident to me now, that tho' this Appointment of the <HI>Form of Bapti&s;m</HI> was pre&s;cribed to be done in <HI>the Name of the Holy Spirit,</HI> as well as <HI>of the Father and the Son,</HI> yet it was by no means nece&s;&s;ary to the Salvation of any Man, and therefore there was no nece&s;&s;ity of having it often repeated. Let us <HI>con&s;ider</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, That the Appointment of it is but once ex|pre&s;&s;ed, and that by one holy Writer, and there is never an actual Example or In&s;tance of this compleat Form of Bapti&s;m practi&s;ed in any place of Scripture. Ob&s;erve that remarkable Text, <HI>Acts</HI> xix. 2. where St. <HI>Paul</HI> inquired of the young Converts that were bapti&s;ed at <HI>Ephe&s;us, Have you received the Holy Gho&s;t &s;ince you be|lieved? and they &s;aid unto him, we have not &s;o much as heard whether there be any Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> He then inquired, unto what were ye bapti&s;ed? and they &s;aid, <HI>Unto John's Bapti&s;m</HI>; and <HI>Paul</HI> had told them that <HI>John</HI> taught them, <HI>that they &s;hould believe on him that &s;hould come after him,</HI> that is, in <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us: when they heard this, they were bapti&s;ed in the Name of the Lord Je&s;us.</HI> Whether they were bapti&s;ed in the <HI>Name of the Holy Spirit,</HI> or no, is not actually expre&s;&s;ed; which is &s;ome|thing &s;trange, when that was the chief Point of En|quiry concerning <HI>their Bapti&s;m into the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Here al&s;o it may be ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e who were here bapti&s;ed, <HI>Acts</HI> xix. 5, 6. immediately received the Holy Gho&s;t; whence it may be very probably inferred, that &s;ome Per&s;ons were bapti&s;ed with the Holy Gho&s;t
<PB N="242" REF="006440_0257_1028F1A9542C65F0">
it&s;elf, who were not actually bapti&s;ed into the Name of the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Con&s;ider</HI> 2dly, When the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Bapti&s;m is men|tioned in &s;everal Places in the Epi&s;tles, it is generally declared that Bapti&s;m was performed in the Name of the Lord <HI>Je&s;us, Rom.</HI> vi. 3. &s;o many of you as were bapti&s;ed into <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> were bapti&s;ed into his Death, <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 27. As many of you as have been bapti&s;ed into <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xii. 13. By one Spirit we are bapti&s;ed into one Body, i. e. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as in the foregoing Ver&s;e, but I can find no mention of the Di&s;ciples being bap|ti&s;ed into the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, Though I am ready to believe from many Ex|pre&s;&s;ions in the Primitive Hi&s;tory of the Church, that the Bapti&s;ers did u&s;ually keep to this Form of Words, <HI>I bapti&s;e thee in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> yet it is evident from a long Account which <HI>Grotius</HI> gives us upon this Text, <HI>Matt.</HI> xxviii. 18. that they u&s;ed divers Forms, that is, they &s;ometimes expre&s;&s;ed the <HI>Father</HI> by a Periphra&s;is, <HI>The God of all, or the God of the whole, the God and Father of the whole,</HI> &s;ome|times <HI>the Son</HI> was expre&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Word,</HI> or the <HI>only be|gotten Son of God:</HI> Sometimes <HI>the Holy Gho&s;t</HI> was ex|pre&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Spirit who in&s;pired the Prophets.</HI></P>
<P>I might add, that upon their Profe&s;&s;ion of the Chri&s;|tian Religion, &s;ometimes it is called the Profe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins,</HI> or the <HI>Catholick Church,</HI> or <HI>Ever|la&s;ting Life,</HI> but they never made a Scruple of their be|ing rightly bapti&s;ed into Salvation upon any of the&s;e Accounts; and I am per&s;waded that had the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves, or the primitive Chri&s;tians, thought it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to Salvation, the Form of Bapti&s;m would have been more expre&s;s in the Hi&s;tory of it, and been more particularly repeated.</P>
<P>I think therefore the <HI>Rule</HI> may &s;tand good &s;till, that where a Doctrine or a Duty is mentioned but in one
<PB N="243" REF="006440_0258_1028F1ABC3DD22C0">
&s;ingle Place of the Scripture, it cannot be of ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity to Salvation. I hope the Reader will for|give this long Digre&s;&s;ion, and then proceed.</P>
<P>On the other hand, where particular Truths or Duties are often repeated in Scripture, and very plainly ex|pre&s;&s;ed in &s;everal Places, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould be &s;ubject to the&s;e Inconveniencies. It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that the Tran&s;cribers of the New Te&s;tament &s;hould make the &s;ame Mi&s;take in every Place, where the&s;e Propo&s;itions are mentioned; that they &s;hould drop them out of every Chapter; that the Tra&s;lator &s;hould mi&s;con&s;true them in every Text; or that their Mi&s;con&s;truction &s;hould always &s;eem to make good Sen&s;e in every Context where they &s;tand; or finally that the Hearer or Reader &s;hould always overlook them when they are found in &s;o many pa&s;|&s;ages, and &s;o often occur to his Ear or Eye.</P>
<P>But it is very apparent, and all Men mu&s;t acknow|ledge that Matters of le&s;s Moment, and things not nece&s;&s;ary, are not mentioned &s;o often: And when they are mentioned, the Scripture &s;ometimes gives no De|termination or po&s;itive Injunctions about them; nor do the Apo&s;tles determine the &s;maller Controver|&s;ies with that plain, exact and po&s;itive Method of Speech, which you find them u&s;e in the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tan|tial Truths and Duties. If we read the 14th <HI>Chap.</HI> to the <HI>Romans,</HI> it mu&s;t convince us of this A&s;&s;ertion. St. <HI>Paul</HI> does not there decide the little Controver&s;ies about Ob&s;ervations of Meats and Days, but &s;eems to leave them to Charity. Nor are the le&s;&s;er Points of Chri&s;tia|nity half &s;o often mentioned, or urged with half &s;o much Vehemence, as the grand Duties of Faith and Love, Repentance and Holine&s;s. In matters of lower Concernment among the Formalities and Modes of Re|ligion, or even in &s;ome higher Articles, who&s;e Cir|cum&s;tances and logical Relations are not nece&s;&s;ary to
<PB N="244" REF="006440_0259_1028F1AF13424470">
Salvation, the Scripture has its <HI>dusnoeta</HI> et fere <HI>aluta,</HI> as Divines call them, <HI>i. e.</HI> almo&s;t insolvable Difficul|ties and Things, very hard to be under&s;tood by Men in this State, at lea&s;t by common Readers.</P>
<P>Sometimes the Matter is &s;o &s;ublime, &s;o unlike all mortal Affairs, and &s;o divinely &s;uperior to every thing here below, that perhaps 'twas not po&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe it fully and plainly in human Words: And the more enlightned the Writer or Speaker was, the deeper and more inexpre&s;&s;ible might &s;ome of the Truths be which he reveals. Our Saviour has made &s;ome &s;uch Di&s;coveries at the latter end of his Prayer in the 17th of St. <HI>John</HI>'s Go&s;pel. Such are the Doctrines of the <HI>Union or Onene&s;s of Chri&s;t with God his Father,</HI> and the <HI>Onene&s;s or Union of the Saints with God and Chri&s;t.</HI> Some things are con&s;trained to be expre&s;&s;ed in a human way le&s;s &s;uitable to their own Dignity, and yet even then they are not perfectly ea&s;y to be under&s;tood, for earthly Metaphors will not convey to our Thoughts a full Idea of things divine and heavenly. When <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> had been teaching <HI>Nicodemus</HI> the Doctrine of Regeneration, <HI>John</HI> iii. 12. he adds, <HI>If I have told you earthly things and ye believe not, how &s;hall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things?</HI> The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> the mo&s;t enlightned of all mere Men, &s;aw and heard &s;ome things among his Vi&s;ions and Re|velations, that were <HI>unutterable,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> xii. And <HI>&s;ome things</HI> which he has publi&s;hed for the U&s;e of the Church, <HI>according to the Wi&s;dom given to him, are hard to be under&s;tood,</HI> as St. <HI>Peter</HI> him&s;elf a&s;&s;ures us, 2 <HI>Peter</HI> iii. 16.</P>
<P>Again, I might take Notice that in Matters which are <HI>Prophetical,</HI> both in the Old Te&s;tament and in the New, there are many dark Expre&s;&s;ions, many Parables and hard Figures of Speech, which are made u&s;e of to expre&s;s and convey &s;ome general and in|di&s;tinct
<PB N="245" REF="006440_0260_1028F1B1D60F9928">
Ideas of future Events, which were not fit to be more fully revealed in that Day, and which only the Accompli&s;hment was de&s;igned to explain the future Days or Ages. <HI>When the&s;e things are come to pa&s;s, then &s;hall ye know that I have foretold them,</HI> John xiii. 19. <HI>and</HI> xiv. 29. <HI>and</HI> xvi. 4.</P>
<P>The Spirit of God, for wi&s;e Ends, hath expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome Things in particular Sea&s;ons, whether Doctrinal or Prophetical, in ob&s;cure Phra&s;es, capable of a double Interpretation. Other things are very briefly hinted, and the holy Writer doth but ju&s;t glance at them in pa&s;&s;ing, and does not dwell upon them long enough to explain them, that being not his pre&s;ent chief De|&s;ign.</P>
<P>Some Words are &s;o ambiguous and of various Meaning in the &s;ame Chapter, that it is not ea&s;y to determine their preci&s;e Sen&s;e in each Ver&s;e; and the&s;e Words al&s;o transferr'd into our Language may not have the &s;ame different Meanings as the Original, and perhaps too, may be determined to the wrong Sen&s;e by the Tran&s;lators; but the Vulgar can read only their own Language, and their Judgments are deter|mined by the Tran&s;lators Opinion. The various Mean|ings put on the Words <HI>Nomos</HI> the Law, <HI>ekkle&s;ia</HI> the Church, <HI>cheirot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">neo</HI> to ordain, <HI>epi&s;kopos</HI> a Bi&s;hop or Over|&s;eer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;ufficiently prove this.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the Sen&s;e of many a Scripture depends not merely on the literal Con&s;truction of the Words, but on the Knowledge of the Context, and on the Con&s;i|deration of the Scope and De&s;ign of the Writer, and perhaps the deeper De&s;ign of the Spirit of God that in&s;pired him: It depends on the Character of the Per&s;on that writes, and on the Character and Con|dition of the Per&s;ons to whom he writes, into what Errors or evil Practices they were fallen, at what Time, and under what Circum&s;tances the&s;e Things fell out:
<PB N="246" REF="006440_0261_1028F1B3636D6988">
All which it is impo&s;&s;ible every Mechanic &s;hould know, and but few Scholars are well acquainted with: The&s;e Difficulties in Scripture occa&s;ion different Opinions among the Readers; and becau&s;e each would impo&s;e his Sen&s;e upon all the re&s;t of Chri&s;tians, a thou&s;and quarrelling <HI>Folios</HI> have &s;prung.</P>
<P>There is another Difficulty and Shade of Darkne&s;s which falls upon many Texts of Scripture, and par|ticularly in the New Te&s;tament, from the extraordi|nary Actions and Modes of Action in the primitive and in&s;pired Times. 'Tis certain that &s;ome things recorded in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, and occa&s;ionally &s;poken of in the Epi&s;tles, refer only to the extraordi|nary and in&s;pired Tran&s;actions of tho&s;e miraculous Times, and cannot be imitated by us: Such are the Communication of Gifts by the Impo&s;ition of Hands, the healing the Sick by anointing with Oil, the mul|titude of u&s;eful Speakers in one A&s;&s;embly, the talking various Languages in publick Wor&s;hip if an Inter|preter were pre&s;ent, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is as certain al&s;o, that &s;ome things are recorded in &s;ome of tho&s;e Scriptures, as Patterns and Directions for our Imitation in all Ages. Such are the Ordinances of Bapti&s;m and the Lord's Supper, the Choice of Deacons, the Ordina|tion of Over&s;eers or Bi&s;hops, the Practice of occa&s;io|nal Communion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But there are &s;ome <HI>Circum&s;tances</HI> relating to the&s;e Actions, concerning winch it is hard to determine how far they belong to the extraordinary Affairs of that Day, and how far they are Rules for our Conduct in ordinary Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Now from all the&s;e Differences have ari&s;en many laborious and angry Volumes of Noi&s;e and Wrangle about the Mint, the Anni&s;e, and the Cummin, about the Dre&s;s and the Fringes of Religion, which have vex'd the learned World, and di&s;quieted and divided the Church of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>

Nay, further, we have good Encouragement to hope, that even in &s;ome things on which Salvation doth not nece&s;&s;arily depend, but are only de&s;igned to promote the farther Sanctification and Comfort, Peace and Hope of the Church, the Spirit of God will often a&s;&s;i&s;t the upright and humble Seeker, yet &s;till there will remain Difficulties enough to exer|ci&s;e inqui&s;itive Souls, for I find no certain Promi&s;e, that God will always &s;atisfy every &s;incere Inquirer in the full Meaning of all difficult Texts.</P>

<P>It is abundantly revealed in Holy Scripture, that without Repentance of our Sins we can never be &s;aved, nor &s;hall any of our Inquities be forgiven without a &s;incere Conver&s;ion to God; but to declare with utmo&s;t Exactne&s;s and full A&s;&s;urance what <HI>Logical Relation</HI> our Repentance bears to our Pardon, Scripture hath not taught us quite &s;o fully, nor &s;o clearly de&s;cribed it.</P>
<P>It is &s;ufficiently plain to every Reader of the Bible, that Holine&s;s of Heart and Life is of ab&s;olute Nece&s;|&s;ity to our Entrance into Heaven, for <HI>without Holine&s;s no Man can &s;ee God</HI>: But how far, and in what pre|ci&s;e Sen&s;e this Holine&s;s and Obedience to the Com|mands of God can give a <HI>Right to enter into the Gates of the City</HI> is &s;omething harder to determine; or what is that &s;ort of Right or Title which our own &s;incere Obedience gives us to the immediate Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ble&s;|&s;edne&s;s, tho' we are fully a&s;&s;ured from &s;everal Places in the Word of God, it is very different from the Right which we obtain by the Obedience and Suffer|ings of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="006440_0265_1028F1BD926F3D00">In &s;ome Places the &s;acred Writer &s;eems to mention one Doctrine, while he is pur&s;uing &s;ome one Subject with Warmth and Zeal; in other Places of Scripture the contrary &s;eems to be &s;ignified or hinted; now both the&s;e in the literal Sen&s;e, and without Limitation, cannot be true: And which of the&s;e two Texts mu&s;t be reduced to the other, by certain Di&s;tinctions and Limitations in order to a Reconciliation, is not &s;o ea&s;y always to determine: For in &s;ome In&s;tances it may happen, that the Propo&s;iton which is but implied in one Text, is nearer the Truth than another Propo&s;ition which &s;eems to be expre&s;&s;ed in another Place; which can only be decided by a due Survey of the Context, and the different De&s;igns of the Writer, and a Com|pari&s;on of other Scriptures.</P>
<P>Therefore if we will di&s;pute about the&s;e &s;olemn Sub|jects, let our warme&s;t Zeal and our &s;harpe&s;t Weapons be engaged again&s;t tho&s;e Adver&s;aries of the Go&s;pel, who attempt to ruin the Foundations of it; let us contend mo&s;t earne&s;tly for the Defence of what God mo&s;t obviou&s;ly and inconte&s;tably reveals; but our coole&s;t Debates, our Candor and Charity, rather than Fiercene&s;s, &s;hould be employ'd about the Points of more dubious Di&s;covery: At be&s;t we &s;hould maintain great Moderation &s;o long, till we find the le&s;&s;er Er|rors &s;preading like a &s;ecret Gangrene, and drawing along with them di&s;mal Con&s;equences, till they are ob&s;erved to infect the more &s;ub&s;tantial parts of Godline&s;s, and endanger the Vitals and very E&s;&s;ence of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>If our Reverend Fathers and Brethren have &s;hewn a fiery Zeal about the&s;e le&s;&s;er Errors, I would per&s;wade my&s;elf their chief Motive was a Su&s;picion of Danger and Ruin to the Go&s;pel it&s;elf, in the Liberty, in the Purity, and in the Glory of it, if they &s;hould have connived at the&s;e le&s;&s;er Mi&s;takes, or treated them with a cold Indifference: And 'tis po&s;&s;ible that &s;ome|times
<PB N="251" REF="006440_0266_1028F1BFF98FD700">
they might have Rea&s;on for their Su&s;picion and their Zeal, though it may be confe&s;&s;ed they were but Men, and their Fervor might &s;ometimes exceed due Bounds.</P>
<P>But, in general, as to the&s;e meaner Point, <HI>Modera|tion</HI> is our Duty: <HI>Whereto we have attained, let us walk by the &s;ame Rule, and if any be otherwi&s;e minded, God in his</HI> mo&s;t proper Sea&s;on <HI>will reveal it al&s;o to them,</HI> Phil. iii. 15, 16. 'Tis as if the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle had &s;aid, that <HI>tho&s;e who tru&s;t only in</HI> Chri&s;t <HI>and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, as the ground of their Acceptance before God,</HI> &s;hall be joyfully received to join their right Hand of Fellow&s;hip with mine; and if they do but <HI>pur&s;ue Holine&s;s &s;incerely from the plainer Motives of Chri&s;tianity,</HI> though they are not well acquainted with tho&s;e mo&s;t noble Principles of it (<HI>viz.) Communion with a &s;uffering, dying and ri&s;ing Saviour as a Repre&s;entative, Pledge and Pattern of &s;piritual dying to Sin, and Re&s;urrection into Holine&s;s,</HI> which are contained in v. 10. yet I will not di&s;turb them about it, but hope God will di&s;cover it to them in his Time.</P>
<P>Yet further, as the great <HI>Doctrines</HI> of Chri&s;tianity and the nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Duties</HI> of it, are very much di&s;|tingui&s;hed from the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary Points, and the Cir|cum&s;tantials of tho&s;e Duties, by their greater Evidence and Clearne&s;s of Revelation; &s;o the more &s;ub&s;tantial Parts of the <HI>Wor&s;hip appointed</HI> in the Go&s;pel, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the le&s;s Important Modes and Cir|cum&s;tances. Solemn Prayer unto God, preaching of the Word, Admini&s;tration of the Ordinances, Bapti&s;m and the Lord's Supper, and a due Attendance thereon, are plainly and certainly required of us that a&s;&s;ume the Name of Chri&s;tians in our &s;acred A&s;&s;emblies. But whether we may borrow A&s;&s;i&s;tance from compo&s;ed Forms in preaching, praying and other Admini&s;trati|ons; or whether we mu&s;t renounce all U&s;e of Forms, Books and Notes to aid our Invention, Memory and
<PB N="252" REF="006440_0267_1028F1C48614CB10">
Expre&s;&s;ion in Prayers and Sermons, are mere accidental Matters, and not written in Scripture with &s;o expre&s;s a Pen. So whether the Per&s;on bapti&s;ed mu&s;t be &s;prinkled or immer&s;ed, and whether the Communi|cants at the Lord's Table mu&s;t &s;it, or lean, &s;tand, or kneel, are le&s;s-e&s;&s;ential Con&s;iderations, and have been the Subjects of dubious Inquiry.</P>
<P>Again, in the Con&s;titution, Order and Government of a Church, the &s;ame Di&s;tinctions may be made al&s;o. That Per&s;ons profe&s;&s;ing the Name of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hould agree to walk and wor&s;hip together at &s;tated Sea&s;ons in the Fellow&s;hip of the Go&s;pel, &s;eems to be a Demand of the Law of Nature, and &s;ufficiently confirmed by many Directions or Examples in po&s;itive Expre&s;&s;ions of Scripture too; That every &s;uch Congregation of faithful People, or voluntary Society of Chri&s;tians, is a Church of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>; That they ought to &s;eclude or put away from their Number, the gro&s;ly ignorant, the &s;candalous and the prophane, and to <HI>withdraw from tho&s;e that walk di&s;orderly</HI>; That there &s;hould be Per&s;ons appointed to mini&s;ter to them in holy things, and that the Society &s;hould honour and maintain them; All the&s;e &s;eem to be plain and undoubted Duty.</P>
<P>But whether this Society may receive and exclude Members without or again&s;t the Con&s;ent of their Pa&s;tor; Whether there mu&s;t be any Elders in a Church di&s;|tinct from and inferior to the Pa&s;tor or Bi&s;hop; Whe|ther the Mini&s;ter needs the Impo&s;ition of the Hands of &s;everal Presbyters, or the &s;uperior epi&s;copal Con|&s;ecration; or whether he be &s;ufficiently ordained by the Choice of the Society, his &s;olemn Acceptance, and his own and their devoting him to God in that Office by Fa&s;ting and Prayer; the&s;e things are not quite &s;o evident in the Writings of the New-Te&s;tament. And while we are required to have no Fellow&s;hip with the openly Wicked, though they are pretended Pro|fe&s;&s;ors

<HEAD><HI>SECT. II.</HI> An In&s;urrection of contending Chri&s;tians.</HEAD>
<P>I am ea&s;ily aware that the Men of Heat and Party, will lift up their Hands in Wonder, when they read this Catalogue and Di&s;tinction of the Affairs of Chri&s;|tianity. I &s;ee them already kindling into Rage again&s;t me; they incompa&s;s my Tent and proclaim War. And upon a Review of their Numbers, their In&s;urrec|tion and their Zeal, I cannot find an Advocate want|ing for any one Sect or Party, among the common Pro|fe&s;&s;ors of the Religion of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in <HI>England.</HI> I &s;ee there <HI>Merges</HI> and his Neighbour <HI>A&s;pergio</HI>; I find <HI>Sedentius</HI> and <HI>Genicola</HI> both there; <HI>Pi&s;copion, Cla&s;&s;icus</HI> and <HI>Antipas</HI> are come thither al&s;o. Each of them a <HI>Prince of their Tribe, and either a Head or a very forward Member of the Family of their Fathers.</HI> Ju&s;t &s;o the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> began to denounce War again&s;t their Brethren <HI>Gad</HI> and <HI>Reuben,</HI> when they built an Altar of Witne&s;s to maintain their Communion with the re&s;t of their Tribes, while they were <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> only in point of Ha|bitation, and dwelt beyond <HI>Jordan</HI>: The&s;e Party-Men are full of Faith and Certainty in every Opinion; they embrace none as Brethren in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> who do not wear their Garb and Livery, and talk not exactly in their Language and Phra&s;es, nor will they hold Com|munion with tho&s;e that di&s;&s;ent from them in the lea&s;t Punctilio's of the Form or Wor&s;hip of Chri&s;tians. <Q>If Men depart from the Truth, &s;ay they, they are in the Way of Error; and 'tis all one whether they

depart little or much, &s;ince they have for&s;aken the Truth we ought to for&s;ake them.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e warm Zealots are not u&s;ed to admit of any Doubt in the &s;malle&s;t Circum&s;tantials of Religion, and becau&s;e they have learnt of their Teachers to affirm all their Tenets with equal Confidence, they believe that the Scripture reveals them all with equal Evidence. A Metaphor &s;miling upon their Practice, is an ex|pre&s;s Command. They can read their indi&s;pen&s;able Duty in a &s;ingle and dubious Example. A remote Conclu&s;ion of their own drawing, at the End of a long Chain of Con&s;equences, gives them re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Con|viction, and appears in their Eye as bright, though di&s;tant, as the Morning-Star. A Circum&s;tance or two of matter of Fact determines their Judgment unchan|geably, for or again&s;t an Opinion, which at mo&s;t is but feebly favoured by tho&s;e very Circum&s;tances; a little Critici&s;m on a &s;ingle <HI>Greek</HI> Word in &s;ome &s;ingle Text of Scripture, becomes a firm Foundation for their Faith: They force &s;ome Text or other to prove every thing which they &s;ay, and when they have im|po&s;ed their Sen&s;e on the Words of the holy Writers, they are &s;ure the Evangeli&s;ts and the Apo&s;tles are of their Mind. Each of them have pickt up &s;ome Scraps of the Arguments of their Party, and they fancy them|&s;elves well equiped and furni&s;h for the Defence of the Truth.</P>
<P><HI>Merges,</HI> a very hone&s;t Man in the main, is newly come out of the Water, and glows all over with Zeal and A&s;&s;urance, that there can be no Bapti&s;m without plunging: He makes a mere Je&s;t of <HI>Baby-Sprinkling,</HI> and declares that if we are not covered with Water, we are not <HI>buried with Chri&s;t</HI>: No hone&s;t Man, &s;ays he, could ever doubt that <HI>John</HI>'s Di&s;ciples were im|mer&s;t at <HI>Enon,</HI> for the Scriptures &s;ay, <HI>there was much Water there,</HI> John iii. 23.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="006440_0270_1028F1CBC9F3D230"><HI>A&s;pergio,</HI> a bold Talker, is as confident that &s;prink|ling, or pouring Water on the Head, is a true Method of Bapti&s;m, and is ready to &s;ay &s;evere things again&s;t the Practice of Immer&s;ion, as if it were not only need|le&s;s, but, as they are ready to call it, fooli&s;h and &s;inful.</P>
<P>'Tis plain, &s;aith he, in the Word of God, that he Apo&s;tles <HI>were bapti&s;ed with the Spirit, which can never mean that they were dipt or plunged into the Spirit, but only that the Spirit was poured out upon them:</HI> And when the <HI>I&s;raelites were bapti&s;ed into</HI> Mo&s;es, 'tis plain they were only &s;prinkled <HI>with the Cloud and the Sea,</HI> Matt. iii. 11. compared with <HI>Acts</HI> ii. 3, 17. and 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> x. 2. and therefore, &s;ays he, I wonder that any Man &s;hould be &s;o weak as to give him&s;elf the trouble of Dipping when he has &s;uch Texts as the&s;e to prove Sprinkling.</P>
<P><HI>Sedentius,</HI> a weak and warm Di&s;&s;enter, is ju&s;t come from St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Cathedral: Being urged by great Cu|rio&s;ity, with much ado he obtained Leave of his Con|&s;cience to go thither and &s;ee Men receive the Lord's Supper kneeling: As he returns he is almo&s;t ready to pronounce Damnation again&s;t the Organs and Singing-Men, for they are all, &s;aith he, the Limbs of <HI>Antichri&s;t</HI>: He whi&s;pers Damnation again&s;t the&s;e Idolaters that bow before a Piece of Bread; for they look as though they wor&s;hipped the Ho&s;t, and belonged to <HI>Rome.</HI> He is very po&s;itive that &s;itting is a Po&s;ture of ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity in that Ordinance, for <HI>Je&s;us</HI> and his Di&s;|ciples <HI>did &s;it and eat,</HI> Mark xiv. 8. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xi. 20. and &s;ince it is called the <HI>Supper of the Lord,</HI> we mu&s;t &s;it down while we partake of it, for every Child knows that Men are never wont to kneel at Supper.</P>
<P>On the other hand, <HI>Genicola</HI> hates the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> for their &s;candalous Irreverence at the Sacrament: <Q>What, &s;aith he, dare any Man u&s;e to clowni&s;h and

&s;o rude a Ge&s;ture as &s;itting, when he receives the Seal of the Pardon of his Sins, and the Emblems of the Body and Blood of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>?</Q> and he forbids all &s;uch Wor&s;hippers from his Communion with this Sen|tence, <HI>Procul, O procul e&s;te, profani</HI>; i. e. <HI>hence ye pro|fane Creatures,</HI> though he can hardly pretend to bring one Text of Scripture for his own Practice: He is &s;ure al&s;o that the Surplice, a Sign or Token of Purity, and as our Reformers teach, ought to be worn at Prayer, for we mu&s;t lift up Hands of Purity and Inno|cence when we come before God; and he finds the long white Garment in the&s;e Words, <HI>Let all things be done decently and in order,</HI> 1 Cor. xiv. 40.</P>
<P>To me, &s;aith <HI>Pi&s;copion,</HI> 'tis as clear as the Light, that no Man can be a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t unle&s;s the Hands of a &s;uperior Man, even a <HI>Dioce&s;an</HI> Bi&s;hop, have been upon his Head; and all the Preachings and Mini&s;trings of &s;uch a pre&s;umptuous Wretch, who was not thus ordained, are but vain Babblings, empty Trifles, and impudent U&s;urpations in the Name of the Lord: For thus &s;aith the Common Prayer Book, which was made by Saints and Martyrs, <HI>It is evident unto all Men, di|ligently reading holy Scripture and ancient Authors, that from the Apo&s;tles time there have been the&s;e Orders of Mini&s;ters in Chri&s;t</HI>'s <HI>Church; Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts, and Deacons.</HI> Thus he proceeds triumphant where the Civil Government is on his Side, and will yield to no Man in Argument or Di&s;pute.</P>
<P>Cla&s;&s;icus ari&s;es in warm Oppo&s;ition to Prelacy, and a&s;&s;erts it an indi&s;putable Truth, that no Mini&s;ter of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is &s;uperior to another: <Q>I read, &s;aith he, in my Bible, no Di&s;tinction between Bi&s;hops and Presby|ters; they are the &s;ame Officers in Scripture; And the Power of Synods is &s;o plainly in&s;tituted at the Council of <HI>Jeru&s;alem, Acts</HI> xv. that I am amazed this &s;hould be e&s;teemed a matter of Doubt or Difficulty;

and I am well a&s;&s;ured of this, becau&s;e <HI>Timothy</HI> had the Hands of the Presbytery laid upon him, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> iv. 14. there is no Man above or below a Pre&s;|byter has any thing to do in ordaining Mini&s;ters &s;ince the Apo&s;tles are dead.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Antipas</HI> grows impatient at the&s;e bold A&s;&s;ertions, and a&s;&s;erts with as much Boldne&s;s, that the Power of ordaining all Sorts of Officers in the Church belongs properly to the Brethren of a &s;ingle Congregation, and none be&s;ides have any Authority to meddle with it, &s;ince the Race of in&s;pired Men are dead and gone: The Brethren have all the Power in their Hands, and 'tis the Church or Congregation alone that has any Manner of Right to chu&s;e and approve and e&s;tabli&s;h its own Pa&s;tors, Elders, Over&s;eers and Deacons: For is it not &s;aid, <HI>Acts</HI> vi. 3. <HI>Look you out among you &s;even Men,</HI> &amp;c. And if this be done at the Choice of <HI>Deacons,</HI> why not of <HI>Elders</HI> too?

<P>Among all the&s;e Combatants there is not one but is &s;o po&s;itive in his own Sentiments, that one would think they had received all their Opinions by In&s;piration, or that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his Apo&s;tles had been preci&s;ely of their Party, and had written their Opinions down in expre&s;s Letters and Syllables. And not only are they &s;o a&s;|&s;ured of the Truth of their Tenets, but the va&s;t Im|portance of them too: And each of them grows angry that his own particular Opinion &s;hould be reckoned among the le&s;s-evident or the le&s;s-important Points of Religion: Their Fury boils high, and their mi&s;taken Zeal and warm Ferment of their Pa&s;&s;ion &s;wells every

<P>They commend and practi&s;e <HI>Vehemence</HI> as a Virtue, and &s;o far forget their Bible as to believe all <HI>Modera|tion</HI> to be a mere Spirit of Indifference, and unworthy of a good Chri&s;tian. They all maintain oppo&s;ite No|tions, yet by their Temper and Conduct they all &s;eem to approve each other's Zeal for his own Party, and with one Con&s;ent they vote me a mere Latitudinarian, a lukewarm Profe&s;&s;or, a Citizen of <HI>Laodicea,</HI> who has not a Spark of Zeal for the Go&s;pel of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> the Wor&s;hip or the Di&s;cipline of his Church.</P>
<P>My dear zealous Friends, be calm a little, and let me &s;peak before I'm condemned. I do not deny many of the&s;e Things which I call <HI>le&s;s-important</HI> to be &s;ome Way di&s;covered in the New Te&s;tament, though not in &s;o expre&s;s and plain Language as you &s;uppo&s;e. The chief Concerns of the Chri&s;tian Church are &s;o far pre|&s;cribed by po&s;itive Rules, by Examples or ju&s;t Infer|ences, that a &s;erious Reader, who is attentive and un|bya&s;&s;ed, and who will exerci&s;e his rea&s;oning Powers, may find &s;ufficient Notices of all nece&s;&s;ary Truth and Duty: According to my Mea&s;ure of Light I humbly hope I have found it, and thereby regulate my Prac|tice.</P>
<P>But &s;till it mu&s;t be granted, that Things le&s;s nece&s;|&s;ary are not &s;o plainly de&s;cribed as the bigger and more &s;ub&s;tantial Parts of Religion, nor graven in Characters &s;o large and obvious that every one mu&s;t needs di&s;cern them. <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us hath been as faithful in his Hou&s;e as Mo&s;es was,</HI> and has delineated the Form, Pattern and
<PB N="259" REF="006440_0274_1028F1D5387FC690">
Order of it, &s;o far as infinite Wi&s;dom thought nece&s;&s;ary to carry on the grand De&s;igns of Grace and the Go&s;pel: But &s;ome of the le&s;&s;er Pins in this &s;piritual Tabernacle are not &s;o graphically decyphered, as that every Child may tell whether they mu&s;t be round or &s;quare. There is nothing of &s;o much Weight depends upon them, and therefore there was no need for them to be &s;o expre&s;ly de&s;cribed under the New Te&s;tament, wherein <HI>bodily Ex|erci&s;e profits little,</HI> but Wor&s;hip and Religion con&s;i&s;t more in what is &s;piritual and invi&s;ible.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the E&s;&s;ay on the <HI>Rea&s;ons why the Wor&s;hip of Chri&s;tian Churches is not &s;o particularly pre&s;cribed as the Jewi&s;h,</HI> which you may find in the Treati&s;e about the <HI>Holine&s;s of Times, Places and Per&s;ons.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Upon the whole then, &s;ince there are different De|grees of Evidence and Clearne&s;s, wherewith &s;ome of the Doctrines of Faith, and the Rules of Wor&s;hip and Order in the New Te&s;tament are expre&s;t, there ought al&s;o to be found in us different Degrees of A&s;&s;ent or A&s;&s;urance, wherewith we &s;hould receive the&s;e Doctrines or the&s;e Rules of Duty: For it is a certain and eternal Rule of <HI>Logic</HI> or <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> that <HI>our A&s;&s;ent to any Propo&s;ition ought to be firm or feeble, ju&s;t in Proportion to the different Degrees of Evidence, whether they be brighter or more ob&s;cure.</HI></P>
<P>Here then is a plain and pretty general Rule given us, whereby we may judge whether any particular Opi|nion or Practice be more or le&s;s important, and con&s;e|quently whether our Zeal for it &s;hould be warmer or cooler, <HI>viz.</HI> Is the Evidence of this Practice, or this Truth in Scripture more bright or cloudy? According to the Light of Evidence, &s;uch generally &s;hould our Zeal be. Violence and fierce Contention among Chri&s;|tians, e&s;pecially about Matters of le&s;&s;er Moment, or of doubtful Di&s;pute, are infinitely &s;candalous to the Chri&s;tian Name; and as they tend to ruin and de&s;troy the

<P>If it would not offend my Readers, I would here come to an ingenuous Confe&s;&s;ion, that the different Sentiments and dreadful Quarrels of Chri&s;tians about &s;ome of the le&s;&s;er Things of Religion, and the dark and dubious Expre&s;&s;ions in Scripture, wherein &s;ome Parts of our Religion are revealed, have &s;ometimes been a &s;ore Temptation and Sorrow to my Heart, &s;o that I have wi&s;h'd the&s;e doubtful Di&s;putables had been more clearly determined there. I have been plunged into the Briars of this Perplexity, when I have &s;een Per&s;ons of devout Soul, &s;erious and humble, di&s;&s;ent &s;o widely from each other, both in Opinion and Practice, and that in Matters of &s;ome Moment too, and even after long and hone&s;t Enquiries into the Meaning of God in his Word.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e Difficulties I have &s;aid in my Heart, <Q>Why did not the God of Wi&s;dom and of Love ex|pre&s;s every Article of Belief and Duty in Words of plaine&s;t Revelation and Precept, that we might have all read the &s;ame Sen&s;e, and been all of one Mind? Why did he leave the lea&s;t Point of our Religion dubious or ob&s;cure, when, with a long Fore&s;ight, he &s;urveyed all the Quarrels and Rage, the infinite Scandal, the Cruelty and the Blood that in future Ages would be the Con&s;equences of Religious Di&s;putes?</Q></P>
<P>I have been pain'd at my Soul, and felt an inward

afflicting Heavine&s;s in &s;uch a Meditation as this; nor could I ever &s;atisfy my&s;elf with that prophane An&s;wer which &s;ome witty Men have given, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That God, who might have made the Rules of our Duty plain and undi&s;puted, cho&s;e to expre&s;s them in Words ca|pable of &s;everal Interpretations, that Chri&s;tians might be liable to be led into many different Opinions, that hereby God might plea&s;e him&s;elf with the Va|riety of Devotions that were paid him; and that how different &s;oever their Sentiments and Practices might be, yet that his Commands are equally obey'd by all the various Kinds of Wor&s;hip and Service, which the Con&s;ciences of Men &s;incerely conceive them|&s;elves bound to offer.</Q> This Notion inclines to that wild Opinion, which &s;uppo&s;es that any Forms or Me|thods of Wor&s;hip are all equally acceptable to God, and that there are more true Religions than one: This &s;avours &s;o much of the <HI>Dei&s;t</HI> and the <HI>Libertine,</HI> and the Di&s;ciples of the <HI>Leviathan,</HI> that I could never admit it into my A&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>Yet it mu&s;t be granted that his Wi&s;dom had &s;ome very valuable Ends to attain in the Way of Providence, by permitting &s;o many Differences among&s;t Chri&s;tians; and if we had been Secretaries to the King of Heaven when he form'd his Decrees, we might have known per|haps &s;ome of the&s;e awful <HI>Arcana</HI> of his Government; but who has been his Coun&s;ellor, or to whom has he given an Account of the&s;e Matters? His Paths are in the great Deep, and his Providences are trackle&s;s through the mighty Waters; <HI>how un&s;earchable are his Ways, and his Judgments pa&s;t finding out!</HI> I dare not pretend to write a compleat <HI>Rationale</HI> on all his infinite and im|penetrable De&s;igns; yet my Faith a&s;&s;ures me that they have all the highe&s;t and divine Rea&s;on in them. And I will take the Freedom here to mention &s;ome of tho&s;e Con&s;iderations that have &s;ilenced my clamorous

Thoughts, plea&s;ed my Enquiry, &s;atisfied my Con&s;cience, and vanqui&s;hed the dark Temptation.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> By the&s;e doubtful Di&s;putables among the acci|dental Things of Religion, God tries our Sincerity, whether we will hold fa&s;t the Sub&s;tantials. The Con|&s;tancy and Courage of a Soul devoted to God is ex|erci&s;ed and proved amid&s;t the Clamours and noi&s;y Con|te&s;ts of the Men of Party and angry Zeal; and when it per&s;evereth in a Cour&s;e of Chri&s;tianity, notwith&s;tand|ing all the&s;e Stumbling Blocks, it approves it&s;elf to God, its Judge and Rewarder. The Differences of true Chri&s;tians in &s;ome Parts of their Faith and Wor|&s;hip, have frighted and &s;candaliz'd the Hypocrite and the giddy Profe&s;&s;or; their Heads have been turned round with every Wind of Doctrine, becau&s;e their Hearts have not been e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Way of Holi|ne&s;s; they have ca&s;t off all the Articles and Practices of Religion, becau&s;e they find &s;o many Sects divided by their little Particularities, and cannot preci&s;ely de|termine every Circum&s;tance of Truth and Duty.</P>
<P>There were Divi&s;ions and Parties, Schi&s;ms and Sects in the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Church, <HI>and they mu&s;t be,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, <HI>that they that are approved may be made manife&s;t among you,</HI> 1 Cor. xi. 19. <HI>Our Lord Je&s;us</HI> forewarns his Di&s;ciples, <HI>that Offences will come,</HI> and 'tis not po&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e; <HI>there &s;hall be Variance</HI> and Strife <HI>in a Man's own Hou&s;hold: But ble&s;&s;ed is he who|&s;oever &s;hall not be offended in me; he that per&s;evereth to the end the &s;ame &s;hall be &s;aved,</HI> Luke xvii. 1. Matt. xi. 6. There are many things in the Chri&s;tian Religion that <HI>become Stones of &s;tumbling, and Rocks of Offence; ble&s;&s;ed are the upright that hold on</HI> their Cour&s;e and Re&s;olution for Heaven, and who&s;e Feet <HI>&s;tumble not upon the&s;e dark Mountains,</HI> becau&s;e of their Neglect to &s;earch out the Truth, or their wilful Ob&s;tinacy in dangerous Er|rors.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="006440_0278_1028F1E044EAE170"><HI>Secondly,</HI> Not only our Sincerity towards God, but our Charity towards fellow-Chri&s;tians is hereby put to the Trial, and Charity is the very Livery of the Di&s;ciples of <HI>Chri&s;t. Hereby &s;hall all Men know that ye are my Di&s;ciples if ye love one another,</HI> John xiii. 35. The Lord hath commanded all his Sheep to wear this Mark of Di&s;tinction from the World, how different &s;oever their le&s;&s;er Opinions are among them&s;elves. Where I behold the Image of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> my Lord &s;tampt in legible Characters upon my Neighbour, can I love him with warm Affection, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hough he never frequents the &s;ame Place of Wor&s;hip with me, though he wears a Garment of another Shape and Colour, prays in a &s;ett Form of Words which I cannot perfectly approve, and &s;ub&s;cribes a Creed of different Expre&s;&s;ions, though the &s;ame in Sen&s;e and Meaning? Can I receive this good Man into my very Soul, who eats nothing but Herbs, and will not &s;it down at my Table becau&s;e Fle&s;h is eaten there? Can I love him at my Heart that loves <HI>Je&s;us</HI> the Lord, though he will not religiou&s;ly ob&s;erve the Fe&s;tival of his Birth or A&s;cen&s;ion? Or do tho&s;e little Words <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> and <HI>Holy Thur&s;day</HI> &s;et my Heart at a Di&s;tance from him, and make him forfeit all my Charity? Such Queries as the&s;e may be a Touch-Stone of our Graces, and the Te&s;t of true Love to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his Saints.</P>
<P>There &s;eems to be &s;omething of this De&s;ign in our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> when he ordered his Servant <HI>Paul</HI> to write the fourteenth Chapter to the <HI>Romans,</HI> where the Apo&s;tle, though he gives a Hint of his own Opi|nion and Liberty in the Go&s;pel, with regard to Meats and Days, yet he doth not impo&s;e the &s;ame Ob&s;erva|tions and Ab&s;tinences on other Chri&s;tians; and though he was in&s;pired, yet he leaves the&s;e things &s;till indif|ferent, and calls them <HI>doubtful Di&s;putations.</HI> Now as the <HI>Trial of our Faith,</HI> through manifold Temptations,
<PB N="264" REF="006440_0279_1028F1E2C62F1970">
<HI>is much more precious than that of Gold that peri&s;hes,</HI> &s;o the Trial of our Love pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;moaky Fires of Contention and Di&s;pute, and not mingling therewith, is di&s;covered to be a pure divine Flame, <HI>and &s;hall be found to Prai&s;e, Honour and Glory at the appearing of</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>whom having not &s;een we love,</HI> 1 Pet. i. 7.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Perhaps our Lord might leave &s;ome le&s;&s;er Points of Religion more ob&s;curely expre&s;&s;ed in his Word, becau&s;e he de&s;igned to continue a Mini&s;try in his Church to the End of the World, or till he came again. While other Chri&s;tians have their Hours and Thoughts engro&s;&s;ed by the Cares of this Life, and want Lei&s;ure and Skill and Means to acquaint them|&s;elves with all the difficult and more ab&s;tru&s;e Parts of Religion, 'tis the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Men that are honoured and employed in the &s;acred Office to <HI>give them&s;elves to Reading,</HI> to &s;earch into the hidden Things of God, and explain the more doubtful Paragraphs of his Word unto Men.</P>
<P>I grant that the fir&s;t and grand De&s;ign of their Studies and public Labours &s;hould be to preach the Go&s;pel of the Grace of God and Reconciliation by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and to make the nece&s;&s;ary Articles of Faith and Prac|tice plain to the meane&s;t Soul: But a Mini&s;ter is al&s;o required to conver&s;e not only with tho&s;e Scriptures which will make <HI>him wi&s;e to</HI> final <HI>Salvation, but</HI> with tho&s;e al&s;o which may <HI>throughly furni&s;h him to every good</HI> Word and <HI>Work,</HI> 2 Tim. iii. 17. that he may <HI>know how to &s;peak a Word in Sea&s;on to every weary Soul,</HI> and to draw Con&s;ciences out of Perplexity which are vexed with Scruples of le&s;s important Things; to in&s;truct them in the Mind and Will of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> about the Me|thods of his Wor&s;hip, and the Order of his Church, <HI>to &s;hew them the Pattern</HI> and Fa&s;hion <HI>of the Hou&s;e of God, and all the Ordinances,</HI> and the Forms and the Laws <HI>thereof</HI>: And that is a Part of his Duty, at proper
<PB N="265" REF="006440_0280_1028F1E608FC79E0">
Sea&s;ons, in &s;ome of his public Mini&s;trations; for he mu&s;t <HI>conceal nothing of the Coun&s;el of God</HI> from them, that may be u&s;eful or profitable to Men: The Me|thods of his Wor&s;hip, and In&s;titutions of his Go&s;pel, &s;hould be trea&s;ured up in his Heart; and upon proper Occa&s;ions, of private Vi&s;it and Conference, <HI>the Lips of the Prie&s;t</HI> &s;hould make it appear that they <HI>keep Know|ledge,</HI> that <HI>the Law may be &s;ought at his Mouth, for he is the Me&s;&s;enger of the Lord of Ho&s;ts,</HI> Mal. ii. 7.</P>
<P>Not that every Man is bound to pay an implicit Faith and blind Obedience to the Opinions and Dictates of his Bi&s;hop or Presbyter. This is Popi&s;h Slavery where&s;oever it is practi&s;ed, and Popi&s;h Tyranny where it is commanded: But Chri&s;tians ought to give due Attention to the Advice and Coun&s;el <HI>of &s;uch as are &s;et over them in the Lord,</HI> Heb. xiii. 17. 1 Cor. xvi. 15, 16. Such as are &s;olemnly devoted to the Mi|ni&s;try of the Go&s;pel, and have addicted them&s;elves to the Study and Search of the Scriptures, and are cho&s;en by the People to be their Teachers, and &s;et apart for that Office in the Way they be&s;t approve; and &s;o far as their Advice is conformable to the written Word, they are to receive it as from &s;ome of the Me&s;&s;engers of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>We may humbly &s;uppo&s;e a <HI>fourth</HI> De&s;ign which God had in his Eye when the &s;acred Penmen wrote &s;o many Ver&s;es of Holy Scripture, which God knew were &s;o difficult to be interpreted; and that is, that no Chri&s;tian might put the Bible out of his own Hands, or neglect to read and meditate and &s;tudy the Word of God; and that together with their Reading they might con|&s;tantly implore the Pre&s;ence of the Spirit, the Enlightner and the Comforter, to lead them into all Truth. It is the Duty of every Man, &s;o far as his Capacity and Op|portunities of Life will admit, to &s;tudy the holy Scrip|tures him&s;elf, and to &s;ee with his own Eyes what he mu&s;t believe, and what he mu&s;t practi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="006440_0281_1028F1E794976490">We &s;hould imitate the Example of the noble <HI>Bereans,</HI> Acts xvii. 11. <HI>who &s;earched the Scriptures</HI> with Diligence, and brought the Sermons of <HI>Paul</HI> him&s;elf unto that &s;acred Touch-&s;tone, to &s;ee if the Things which he &s;poke were true or no: And after all our Study, we &s;hall find &s;uch Difficulties that will convince us of the Nece&s;&s;ity of depending upon a higher Teacher, even the Holy Spirit. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour commands that we &s;earch the Scriptures, and pray for the Spirit too, <HI>John</HI> v. 39. <HI>Luke</HI> xi. 9, 13. And St. <HI>Paul</HI> prays unto God that he would give to the Saints which were at <HI>Ephe&s;us, that Spirit of Wi&s;dom and Revelation to enlighten the Eyes of their Under&s;tanding,</HI> Ephe&s;. i. 17. <HI>this Unction which</HI> true Believers <HI>have from the Holy One, makes known to them all Things</HI> nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation, 1 <HI>John</HI> ii. 20. And though we have no Ground to expect that he will unfold to us every le&s;&s;er Difficulty, while we live in this World; yet we may humbly hope that in tho&s;e Things which regard the Forms of his own Wor&s;hip, and the Means of his own vi&s;ible Glory among&s;t Men, he will by Degrees let &s;ome divine Rays of Light into the Mind of him that &s;eeks after Truth with great Diligence, fervent Prayer, and more &s;incere De&s;igns. There are many In&s;tances to be given of plain Chri&s;|tians that have been made the Favourites of the en|lightning Spirit, and have arrived at uncommon Know|ledge in Chri&s;tianity by the&s;e Methods.</P>
<P>A <HI>Fifth</HI> ble&s;&s;ed End, and which is certainly attained in the Providence of God, by leaving &s;o many Di&s;pu|tables in Religion, is, that our Souls are hereby drawn out to long for Heaven, and pant after the State where there is no Contention, no Di&s;pute. This Pro&s;|pect renders tho&s;e happy Regions more de&s;ireable whil&s;t we are here, and more abundantly welcome here|after.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="006440_0282_1028F1EA328EEEA0">It is impo&s;&s;ible that any Controver&s;y &s;hould there ari&s;e to interrupt the Wor&s;hip of the Church trium|phant. It is eternally impo&s;&s;ible to divide them into Parties, or to di&s;turb their Repo&s;e. The Doctrines of their Profe&s;&s;ion are all written as with Sun-Beams, they are no longer the Articles of Faith, but the Ob|jects of Sight: <HI>We &s;hall be all taught of God, we &s;hall &s;ee Face to Face, and know as we are known.</HI> So much of the Holy Spirit dwells in all the Saints, as a perpetual Spring of Revelation and Wi&s;dom.

The Soul that is once admitted into that Fellow&s;hip &s;hall abide like a <HI>Pillar in the Temple of his God, and &s;hall go no more out;</HI> but the Hypocrite and the Unclean &s;hall never enter there. The Wor&s;hip that is paid there is with perfect Uniformity of Mind and Affection among&s;t all the happy Spirits; an una|nimous Con&s;ent in Self-aba&s;ement, divine Honour and Love; and perhaps when our Bodies &s;hall be rai&s;ed again to make a vi&s;ible Church in Heaven, Wor&s;hip may be perform'd with a glorious Liberty, and with &s;uch a plea&s;ing Variety of Form as glorified Nature &s;hall dictate, and our exalted Rea&s;on approve; but &s;till with the Exerci&s;e of the &s;ame perfect Love and Delight among the Wor&s;hippers, and under the Influence of the &s;ame Spirit.</P>

<P>GIVE me Leave, my dear Friend, to make a chari|table Apology for hone&s;t and upright Souls, who maintain a &s;trict Cour&s;e of Piety and Virtue, and yet appear to be unalterably determined for or again&s;t the Communion of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> upon very &s;light and feeble Grounds: Perhaps we &s;hall learn Com|pa&s;&s;ion to the Weakne&s;&s;es of our fellow Chri&s;tians, if you and I together meditate on the&s;e following Con&s;idera|tions.</P>
<P>Let us take a Survey how many are the Circum&s;tances and various Occurrences of human Life, which do &s;ome|times powerfully determine the Opinions even of good and &s;ober Men, to one or the other &s;ide of this Contro|ver&s;y, whether they &s;hall fix their Communion in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> or among&s;t tho&s;e who &s;eparate from it.</P>
<P>Here the fir&s;t thing that naturally occurs, is the <HI>Edu|cation of different Per&s;ons,</HI> which has a mighty Influence to form their Opinions, and to fix their Practice; and this, it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, is not in a Man's own Choice: the Providence of the great and ble&s;&s;ed God, the Over-ruler

prevent all the Faults of this kind in the Education of Children, by the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of Parents.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Since I have Occa&s;ion, in this Place, to mention the <HI>Education of Children,</HI> among&s;t Per&s;ons of the <HI>E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church,</HI> and tho&s;e that have <HI>&s;eparated from it,</HI> I could &s;carce excu&s;e it to my own Con&s;cience, if I &s;hould neglect to make this <HI>&s;olemn Remark</HI> on both (<HI>viz.</HI>) that there is &s;omething very dangerous that is early impre&s;&s;ed on the Minds of Children of the one Party and the other, and they unhappily learn it from the different re&s;pective Catechi&s;ms in which they are in&s;tructed.</P><P>The Children who are educated in the <HI>Church of England,</HI> as &s;oon as they have learnt to an&s;wer <HI>what is their Name?</HI> they are immedi|ately told in the next An&s;wer, that in their Bapti&s;m, <HI>They are made the Members of Chri&s;t, the Children of God,</HI> and <HI>inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> This ari&s;es from the Doctrine they are generally taught, that Bapti&s;m and Regeneration are much the &s;ame thing, or that all Men are regenerated by being bapti&s;ed; whereas in Scripture, Bapti&s;m is but an Emblem and Repre&s;entation of &s;uch a Change of the Heart, as Regeneration requires and implies; and for want of this Di&s;tinc|tion, the Children u&s;ually grow up through all their Stations in Life, without enquiring whether they have had any &s;uch real Change in their Souls, as includes in it Repentance for Sin, and a turn of Soul towards God and Godline&s;s, whereby a Man is born again and be|comes a new Creature.</P><P>And this nece&s;&s;ary Change, upon which the Favour of God, and an Intere&s;t in the Salvation of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and the Kingdom of Heaven depend, is very gro&s;ly and &s;hamefully neglected by them through their whole Lives, they always &s;uppo&s;ing, as they have been taught, that all this Work is done in Bapti&s;m.</P><P>And for this Rea&s;on many Divines of the Church of <HI>England</HI> have heartily wi&s;hed that either the&s;e Words in the Catechi&s;m were a little altered, or that this An&s;wer &s;hould never be taught to Children without explaining the Meaning of it.</P><P>Among the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> one Part of the Education is u&s;ually learning the Catechi&s;m written <HI>by the A&s;&s;embly of Divines at We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI> Now in the 19th An&s;wer it is &s;aid, <HI>That all Mankind by their Fall, are under the Wrath and Cur&s;e of God,</HI> and <HI>&s;o made liable to all the Mi&s;eries in this Life, to Death it&s;elf,</HI> and <HI>to the Pains of Hell for ever</HI>: And &s;ome Per&s;ons have been &s;o gro&s;ly unwi&s;e, as to a&s;&s;ert under this Influence, that there are Children of a Span long &s;uffering the Vengeance of God in Hell, for their Intere&s;t in the Sin of <HI>Adam.</HI> Now the very Hint of &s;uch a Notion frights Children terribly, and while they are required to love God with all their Hearts, it gives them a very terrible and cruel Notion of the great and ble&s;&s;ed God, who has ordain'd young Children to the&s;e everla&s;ting Torments for the Sin of <HI>Adam.</HI></P><P>There are &s;ome that deny this An&s;wer, and renounce this Doctrine roundly.</P><P>Indeed there is one Author that has endeavoured to explain it in a moderate way, and to make a ju&s;t Di&s;tinction upon this Subject, and that is in the la&s;t Que&s;tion of a Book called the <HI>Ruin and Recovery of Mankind.</HI> There it is &s;hewn that all good Chri&s;tians by their Faith in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> are become the Children of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and that they and their infant Children have an Intere&s;t in the Promi&s;e made to <HI>Abraham,</HI> Gal. iii. 26.29. (<HI>viz.</HI>) that <HI>God would be their God, and the God of their Seed,</HI> which gives abundant Hope for the Children of good Parents dying in Infancy, that they are tran&s;lated to the Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of Heaven, and the Hope of a joyful Re&s;urrection by the <HI>Covenant of Abraham.</HI> And it is the Children of the Wicked, who have never ac|cepted of the Covenant of Grace, are left under the Cur&s;e, <HI>i. e.</HI> of temporal Death, which <HI>Adam</HI> had incurred for him&s;elf and his Po&s;|terity, and that without any Prediction or Promi&s;e of any Re&s;urrection at all.

<P><PB N="273" REF="006440_0288_1028F224B73F99B8">The&s;e Things joined together, put a &s;trong Bia&s;s upon the Judgment of the Man, and it is exceeding difficult to be removed; and 'tis evident that his Prayers, his Prac|tice in Religion, his &s;ecret Acts of Devotion, are all re|gulated by the In&s;tructions he has received from his Parents or &s;ome of his Teachers: This makes his Spirit grow unea&s;y under ceremonious Forms, and he is quite untun'd for Devotion by the very Sound of the Organ. The&s;e Things mu&s;t needs have a mighty Force on the Minds of young &s;incere Creatures beginning their Cour&s;e of Religion and Chri&s;tianity, to e&s;tabli&s;h them in the <HI>Nonconformi&s;t</HI> Way.</P>
<P>And I might al&s;o add, how rude and indecent a Thing the plain and natural Wor&s;hip of the Di&s;&s;enters appears
<PB N="274" REF="006440_0289_1028F2264D74A808">
to one, that has been bred up to Ornament and Ceremony in the &s;everal Parts of Wor&s;hip in the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Church.</P>
<P>By Education and Cu&s;tom, a particular Form of Re|ligion is &s;o mingled with their Nature, and wrought into their Con&s;titution, that you might as &s;oon alter their Palate, and change their Ta&s;te of Meats, as you can per&s;wade their Souls to di&s;like the Mini&s;try under which they have been brought up, and to for&s;ake the Mode of Wor&s;hip to which they have been trained. They are &s;o po&s;itive they are in the right, that they never had any Thought of calling the&s;e Things to a new Examination.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Prejudice of the Mind in favour of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> grows yet &s;tronger, if <HI>Jonathan</HI> has found his Soul awakened to a Fear of Hell, and been effec|tually convinced of Sin by the Terrors of the Law under the Preaching of &s;ome <HI>Boanerges,</HI> &s;ome Son of Thunder in a Meeting-hou&s;e; and has been afterwards led gently into the Knowledge of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> the Saviour, and has been taught to apply him&s;elf unto him for Salvation by humble Faith.</P>
<P>If the Spirit of God has made the Preaching of Par|don and Grace, by a Di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ter, effectual to claim the Surges of his troubled Con&s;cience, and to lead him the Way of Peace and Holine&s;s towards Heaven, perhaps he feels his Pa&s;&s;ions refined, his &s;inful Appetites mortified, his Temper changed from earthly and carnal, to &s;piritual and heavenly, how naturally will his whole Soul be carried out to love this Mini&s;try? and he would not willingly ab&s;ent him&s;elf one Day from the Teachings of this <HI>Barnabas,</HI> this Son of Con|&s;olation; he de&s;pi&s;es all the finer Flouri&s;hes of Elo|quence, he can take no Plea&s;ure in the more polite, and perhaps more argumentative Di&s;cour&s;e of a Doctor or a Bi&s;hop in the <HI>Church of England;</HI> but where he
<PB N="275" REF="006440_0290_1028F227EFC97988">
has found Light and Food, and Re&s;t for his dark and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and hungry Soul, thither he will go con&s;tantly to Wor&s;hip, and he calls that the Sanctuary of the Lord, without once enquiring whether a Pari&s;h Church may not be the Sanctuary of the Lord too; nay per|haps his Pa&s;&s;ion for the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> may ri&s;e &s;o high as to deny the Pre&s;ence of God in the A&s;&s;emblies of the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, or to allow very little of it there.</P>
<P>And by the &s;ame fal&s;e Method of Rea&s;oning may a Churchman, who&s;e Soul has been brought to Repen|tance and Holine&s;s by the Mini&s;try of the public Church, on which he has attended, almo&s;t hate the Name of a Nonconformi&s;t, and &s;everely inveigh again&s;t them all as Sci&s;matics and fooli&s;h Teachers, when perhaps he never ventur'd into a Meeting-hou&s;e, nor heard one Sermon in any of their A&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>So far is it po&s;&s;ible for Piety, Ignorance and Preju|dice to meet in the &s;ame Mind: But our God, who knows the Frame of human Nature, looks down and pities and forgives. A hearty Tendency towards God, and a Pur&s;uit of Heaven is well-plea&s;ing in his Sight; though perhaps the Traveller, through Ignorance, takes many a wrong Step, and performs many a Duty not exactly conformable to the Directions of the Word.</P>
<P>Now, though this Argument be &s;ufficient to deter|mine him to be a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> in Oppo&s;ition to other Re|ligions, becau&s;e other Religions have not this Power to &s;anctify him, yet it ought not to be &s;ufficient for ever to determine him to a particular Party of Chri&s;|tians, becau&s;e it was not the particular Opinions of that Party, but the &s;ub&s;tantial and great Doctrines of Chri&s;tianity or the Go&s;pel, which are profe&s;&s;ed and pretended to by both Parties, that were &s;o powerful to the turning of his Heart towards God.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="006440_0291_1028F22AAF3F90D8">After all this Di&s;cour&s;e, I would not be under&s;tood as though I encouraged this Lazine&s;s of Men, and Neglect of due and ju&s;t Rea&s;oning; no, for Rea&s;on is the Talent that God hath given to be u&s;ed in the Affairs of Religion, and he hath given us the Rule of his own Word for our Determination, by which all our Wor&s;hip ought to be regulated, and not by human Inventions; and Men are highly guilty in their Neg|lect hereof: But a gracious God will forgive, for he knows our Frame and our Frailty.</P>
<P>I believe God doth accept of &s;uch inward, &s;incere and experimental Arguments as vulgar Chri&s;tians u&s;e to make or keep them&s;elves <HI>Churchmen</HI> or <HI>Di&s;&s;enters, Calvini&s;ts</HI> or <HI>Arminians.</HI> If they feel their Souls rai&s;ed to a more heavenly Frame, and effectually engaged to the Love of God, Religion and Ju&s;tice, by attending occa&s;ionally on a Mini&s;try different from their Educa|tion, &s;ometimes they will be ready to &s;eparate even from a true Church to which they belonged, for want of knowing the Guilt and Terrors and Damnation that &s;ome Men include in that hard Word, <HI>Schi&s;m;</HI> and I per&s;wade my&s;elf that a gracious God will accept of their upright De&s;igns and their hone&s;t Motives, will pardon their Separation, though it &s;hould prove un|warrantable, and ble&s;s their new Communion to the Advantage of their Souls.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> But &s;uppo&s;e a Man &s;hould forcibly dive&s;t him&s;elf of all former Aver&s;ions and Inclinations to the &s;eparate or the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Churches, and enter into a &s;ober Search, and &s;olemn Debate with him&s;elf about the Merits of the Cau&s;e; how few are there, who&s;e nece&s;&s;ary Affairs of Life a low them Time enough to go through the Study of the&s;e laborious and intangled Controver&s;ies? How &s;mall a Part of Mankind that are born to &s;ecular Affairs, can, in their few Hours of Lei&s;ure, find out the Depth of &s;ome of the&s;e Difficul|ties?
<PB N="277" REF="006440_0292_1028F22EE53B6328">
Who is &s;harp enough on the Sudden to di&s;tin|gui&s;h Truth in the Mid&s;t of the Clouds of Du&s;t that are ca&s;t on it by the litigious Wrangle of all Parties?</P>
<P>The Soul of many a Trade&s;man is but ju&s;t of a Size with his Shop and Bu&s;ine&s;s, and hath not Strength of Parts or Improvement to attain great and accurate Knowledge in any Thing be&s;ides; and tho&s;e who&s;e Ingenuity is greater, may ea&s;ily wa&s;te all the &s;pare Hours of their Life in treading the Mazes of Di&s;pute about Forms and Ceremonies, and at la&s;t find them|&s;elves bewilder'd: Now I que&s;tion whether &s;uch a Man's Head would lie ea&s;y upon a dying Pillow, who had &s;pent his Time among Briars and Thorns, and neglected the Fruit of the Tree of Life, or ta&s;ted but very little of it; he has been dwelling upon the Mo&s;s and the Ivy, and not gathered the Product of tho&s;e eminent Branches of our holy Religion, whence he might have extracted &s;weet Cordials for a langui&s;hing and fainting Hour.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> Again, how very few are there among&s;t the giddy Race of Men that can &s;o far annihilate their old Opinions, and refrain &s;o long from embracing new ones, till they have made a thorough Scrutiny into the Arguments and Preten&s;ions on both Sides? Who can dwell for Months together in the unea&s;y State of Dubitation? Who is there that has Power enough over his own Thoughts, as to hold his Judg|ment in Su&s;pence for a con&s;iderable Sea&s;on, till the Matter in que&s;tion be fairly debated, and brought to an I&s;&s;ue in the Court of Rea&s;on and Scripture? How ready are we to incline our A&s;&s;ent one Way or another, as the various Occurrences of Life pre&s;ent Shadows of Argument for either Opinion? A Story of a wicked Clergyman of the Church will warp the enquiring Soul of a Plebeian towards a Meeting-hou&s;e; and an old Song of <HI>Charles</HI> the Martyr will determine another's

Judgment again&s;t the cruel Di&s;&s;enters, and make him a compleat Churchman. A Fla&s;h of Rhetoric, a Show of Rea&s;on, a warm Sermon, and Affections rai&s;ed by a <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> or a <HI>Mead</HI> at <HI>Pinners-Hall,</HI> will immediately turn the Mind from its Equilibrium; and you know when a Balance is ju&s;t turned, though it be but by a Grain of Weight, it falls effectually on that Side, and &s;ometimes almo&s;t irrecoverably too.</P>
<P>When we have thrown off all old Prejudices, 'tis not ea&s;y to &s;ecure one's &s;elf from new ones. When we have &s;o far gained the Victory over Education and Cu&s;tom as to retain none of our ancient Opinions, we are apt to fall in&s;en&s;ibly under the Power of the oppo|&s;ite Doctrines, and become Captives and Slaves to new Notions, merely becau&s;e they are new. Novelty is as great a Prejudice to fair Rea&s;oning as Antiquity; though perhaps not &s;o univer&s;ally prevailing. And there's many a giddy and head&s;trong Youth that has ha&s;tily embraced Maxims and Practices contrary to tho&s;e of his Parents, to &s;how how bravely he has broke all the Fetters of Education, and to make it appear that he thinks freely. When we pu&s;h the Boat off from the Shore where it has long &s;tuck in the Mud, 'tis hard to prevent its being &s;tranded on the adver&s;e Side. 'Tis exceeding difficult to keep the Mind in this Medium of Su&s;pence till right Rea&s;on determine it; 'tis very trouble&s;ome to maintain the Judgment in a Poi&s;e till &s;ome weighty and &s;olid Argument &s;ink one of the Scales downward, and equitably decide the de|pending Strife of Opinions; there is Need of continual caution and wary Motions of Thought: A doubting Spirit is in Pain, and willing to be relea&s;ed. We are very de&s;irous to believe &s;omewhat, though upon &s;light Grounds, that our Souls may be at Ea&s;e, and fall to Practice.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="006440_0294_1028F233040E2988"><HI>Fifthly.</HI> But &s;uppo&s;e Men &s;hould have Lei&s;ure, and Books and other Advantages, joined with Re&s;olu|tion and Patience enough to endure the Pain of Dubi|tation, and the long Fatigue of deep Study and Thought|fulne&s;s; yet how &s;mall is the Number of tho&s;e that are capable to di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt real and apparent Rea&s;on; e&s;pecially in Subjects where the Differences are of &s;o nice and intricate a Kind? How few Under&s;tandings are &s;o acute, how few Judgments &s;o &s;olid and ju&s;t, &s;o well form'd and well-improv'd, as to determine Con|trover&s;ies &s;o long and &s;o much darkened?

<P>Turn your Eyes inward, my Friend, and behold a Soul there that has more Knowledge and Judgment than Hundreds of the Animals that are round about you, and that you are forced to conver&s;e with; and yet after all your unbia&s;&s;ed Searches and Labours, and earne&s;t Prayers, how hard a Thing you find it to re|&s;olve the Point, whether you ought to remain in the Communion of a Di&s;&s;enting Church, or become a Se|parati&s;t from them, and unite your&s;elf to the Church of <HI>England.</HI> Now, if all your Lei&s;ure, your Advan|tages, and your Application, ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">not fix your A&s;&s;ent and Practice, infer then how vain a Thing it is to ex|pect that Rea&s;on and Argument &s;hould con&s;tantly de|termine and govern a blind, a ra&s;h, a ruin'd, and a wretched World.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, in Things of greater Importance, and Ne|ce&s;&s;ity to Salvation, our Directions lie &s;o plain, as to lead the mo&s;t &s;tupid Souls that are hone&s;t and &s;incere, to the Knowledge of Truth and Duty, unle&s;s it be here and there a Man who violently breaks through the very Language of Scripture, and runs into great Errors or Irregularity of Practice: But in Things of

lo&s;s Moment, how impo&s;&s;ible is it that the generally of Mortals &s;hould build every le&s;&s;er Opinion of them upon &s;olid Foundations and un&s;haken Grounds? Or how can we expect they &s;hould be able to defend every &s;maller Circum&s;tance of their Practice by ju&s;t Rea|&s;onings?</P>
<P>If I were to recapitulate the&s;e Things in &s;hort, I would draw up my charitable Conclu&s;ion thus:</P>
<P>Since our fir&s;t Apo&s;tacy from God has &s;o perverted and &s;poiled our rational Powers, and en&s;laved our Minds to &s;o many Prejudices and Pa&s;&s;ions; &s;ince the Impre&s;|&s;ions of Education and Cu&s;tom are unavoidable and nece&s;&s;ary, deep and &s;trong; &s;ince the Affairs of the World that is under a divine Cur&s;e, are &s;o ju&s;tly and unhappily ill con&s;tituted; &s;ince Capacity, Lei&s;ure, Ap|plication, Humility, and Prayer, are all found together but in very few Per&s;ons; and &s;ince the divine Oracles, in Matters le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary, have &s;o much Ob&s;curity in them&s;elves, and &s;o much thicker Darkne&s;s ca&s;t upon them by contending Parties, why &s;hould we be &s;o much amazed or &s;o angry, to &s;ee &s;o many different Senti|timents and Practices among&s;t Men of hone&s;t Piety, and de&s;irous of Truth?</P>
<P>Farewel, thou dear Companion of my Studies, and if your Light and Knowledge &s;hould be &s;o far improved by your further Enquiries, as to lead you away from that Communion, and tho&s;e Methods of Wor&s;hip wherein we have &s;o often and &s;o delightfully join'd; yet I hope that upon the Review of this Letter, you will maintain a very charitable Opinion of</P>
