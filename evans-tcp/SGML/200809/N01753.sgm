His Divinity was Solid, Well-grounded &amp; Orthodox, of the Old Puritan Stamp; His Preaching as it was the effect of hard Study, Prayer &amp; Reading: &s;o it proved very Grave, Learned, Methodical and Accurate. His ordinary Sermons were fit for the Pre&s;s; and yet &s;uch his humility, that he thought no|thing of his worth Publi&s;hing.

<P>Argu. 1. THAT the Mini&s;try of the Word is the All-&s;ufficient Means of gathering Souls under the Wing of CHRIST's Covenant appears <HI>from the Univer&s;allity and Antiquity of the&s;e Means.</HI> Thus Adam and Eve were brought under the Wing of Chri&s;t. <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.15. Joh. 8.56. <HI>Your father Abra|ham rejoyced to &s;ee my day: and be &s;aw it and was glad.</HI> Luk. 24.25, 26, 44, 45. Therefore the Go&s;pel is the Everla&s;t|ing Go&s;pel. <HI>Rev.</HI> 14.6. only Preached with this di&s;tinction, From the begin|ning Chri&s;t's coming, it was to them in promi&s;e; but to us, in performance. <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.2, 3, 4.</P>
