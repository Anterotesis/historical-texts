<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THis excellent Sermon comes to you upon the mo&s;t important Errand that can po&s;&s;ibly be, even to per&s;wade you to embrace the great Salvation offered to you in the Go&s;|pel, by a glorious Redeemer: One would think few Arguments might per&s;wade Peo|ple to embrace a Ble&s;&s;ing &s;o much to their Plea&s;ure, Profit and Advantage; but &s;ad it is to &s;ee that the mo&s;t inexpre&s;&s;ibly glori|ous Things of the heavenly World are &s;o &s;lighted, neglected and de&s;pi&s;ed by almo&s;t all the &s;inful Race of fallen apo&s;tate Man: And how much more &s;trange that &s;o many Argu|ments mu&s;t be u&s;ed and that to &s;o little Pur|pose, to per&s;wade Men to accept of &s;uch glo|rious Things as in the Word of God we are a&s;&s;ured are prepared for, and &s;hall certainly be given to the Embracers of this great Sal|vation. The Author who is now reaping the happy Fruits and Effects thereof, and beholding and enjoying the Ble&s;&s;ings that doth accompany the &s;ame, has &s;o &s;weetly and earne&s;tly per&s;waded to the Embracement thereof, that I &s;hall &s;ay no more, but look up to the God of all Grace for his Ble&s;&s;ing up|on the delightful, awakening, Soul comfort|ing Di&s;cour&s;e,</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>HEB. II. 3.</HI></BIBL>
<P>How &s;hall we e&s;cape if we neglect &s;o great Salvation, which at the fir&s;t began to be &s;poken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him.</P></Q>

<P>_THERE are two great and mo&s;t ordinary Complaints in the&s;e days. 1. There are many who complain, that their E&s;tates and Per&s;ons are in Bondage, and that they are &s;old for &s;laves to the Hands of Strangers: But, O that we could al&s;o turn over the Complaint to this, that our Souls are in Bondage, and that we are yet <HI>in the Gall of Bitterne&s;s, and in the Bond of Iniquity,</HI> that &s;o we might be provoked
<PB N="2" REF="003424_0004_0FF83C404CADDD68">
to long for the great Salvation that is in our Offer. 2. There are many complain|ing (and not without much cau&s;e) that there is now &s;uch a toleration of Errors: But O wilt thou complain al&s;o of this, that within thy Heart there is a Tollera|tion of Lu&s;ts; is there not an Act of Tol|leration concluded within thy Brea&s;t, that the Devil and all his Company may reign in thee at Plea&s;ure: Oh have ye not need of the great Salvation? Shall I tell you, that Chri&s;t is courting you to embrace it, and that he putteth all his mo&s;t glorious Robes upon you, and manife&s;teth him&s;elf unto you, as a Suiter making offer of him|&s;elf and of his great Salvation O tell me, Have ye &s;een him? Or do ye think to &s;ee him this Day? What Robes had he on? There are five glorious Robes where|with he cloaths him&s;elf when he conde|&s;cendeth to manife&s;t him&s;elf to his people. Fir&s;t he cometh to his own with the <HI>Gar|ments of Salvation,</HI> according to that Word, Zech. 9.9. <HI>Rejoice O Daughter of Sion greatly, &s;hout O Daughter of Jeru&s;alem:</HI> for <HI>behold, thy King cometh unto thee, he is ju&s;t, and having Salvation</HI>; ay, your King is come here to day, and will ye not fall in love with him when he is cloathed with the Garments of Salvation, can ye e|ver have a more conquering Sight of Chri&s;t, then when he is cloathed with &s;uch an excellent Robe, and offering you Salvation.
<PB N="3" REF="003424_0005_0FF83C41D829A758">
Secondly, He appeareth to his own <HI>in Garments died in Blood,</HI> according to that Word, I&s;ai. 63.1, 2. <HI>Who is this that com|eth up from Edom with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ed Garments in Blood, as one that treadeth the Wine fat.</HI> And now I &s;ay to thee that will not look to Chri&s;t, when he appears in the Gar|ments of Salvation, have ye a Heart to refu&s;e him that hath fought &s;uch a Com|bate for you, who <HI>hath trod the Wine-Pre&s;s alone,</HI> and hath &s;tained all his Garments with the Blood of thy Enemies; or is there any here who dare refu&s;e his Salva+tion, when they &s;ee how <HI>he treadeth his Enemies in Anger, and trampleth them in Fury,</HI> and thus <HI>&s;prinkleth their Blood upon his Garments.</HI> O tremble at this Sight, and &s;eek Quarter from him in time, or he &s;hall dy his Garments with the Blood of thy immortal Soul. Thirdly, Chri&s;t ap|peareth unto his own, being cloathed with the&s;e humble Robes of Conde&s;cendency, when he came in <HI>the &s;imilitude of &s;inful Fle&s;h</HI>: O what a Sight was that, to behold the Prince of Heaven cloathed with our Nature; What a Sight was that to behold him that was <HI>cloathed with Light as with a Garment,</HI> to be cloathed with <HI>our Infir|mities,</HI> yet he conde&s;cended to cloath him|&s;elf thus, that we might have acce&s;s unto him, and be partakers of his Gifts: O can we refu&s;e him, when love hath thus pre&s;&s;|ed him to put on the beggarly Weed that <HI>he might say to Worms, ye are my Brethren
<PB N="4" REF="003424_0006_0FF83C4394EDC5D8">
and my Si&s;ters.</HI> Fourthly, Chri&s;t &s;ometimes manife&s;teth him&s;elf, being cloathed with the Garments of Beauty, &amp; ravi&s;hing Ma|je&s;ty; &s;uch was the Sight that the Spou&s;e got of Chri&s;t, Cant. 2.3. <HI>As the Apple tree among the Trees of the Wood, &s;o is my Beloved among the Sons.</HI> And 5.10. when &s;he &s;aw him, <HI>White and rudy, and the &s;tan|dard-bearer of ten thou&s;and,</HI> and when &s;uch was the joyful Sight of him, when his Gar|ments were as Light, <HI>and white as the Snow,</HI> which he had at the Transfigurati|on, when the&s;e glorified ones did come (as it were) Amba&s;&s;adors from that high|er Hou&s;e to make him a Vi&s;it. And fifth|ly, Chri&s;t he &s;ometimes appeareth to his own in Robes of dreadful Maje&s;ty, and terrible Highne&s;s and Loftine&s;s, when the Soul upon the fir&s;t Sight of him remains dead, and there remains no more Life in them: Such was the Sight <HI>Daniel</HI> got in his 10. Chapter. And &s;uch was the Sight that <HI>John</HI> got of Chri&s;t, <HI>Rev.</HI> 1.17. And I would ask at all that are here, what a Sight have ye gotten of Chri&s;t to day, in which of all the&s;e Robes have ye &s;een him: It is true, we are not now to look for the extraordinary Sights of him; but yet if ever thou ha&s;t &s;een him in any of his woing Robes, &s;urely he hath appeared Matchle&s;s, and how &s;hall ye then refu&s;e him.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="003424_0007_0FF83C464B7096C0">But now to come to the Words I was &s;peaking unto you of; The fir&s;t thing in the Words, viz.</P>
<Q>That there are many who live under the Offer of this great Salvation that do &s;light it, and do not embrace it.</Q>
<P>And now, I &s;hall only add a few things further unto you.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let me propo&s;e a few Con&s;iderations to <HI>per&s;wade you to embrace the great Sal|vation.</HI> God forbid we go away before we embrace this Go&s;pel-Salvation: And therefore, I charge you in his Name, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> not away before ye embrace it. And <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> pre&s;s it home upon you, there are th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> eight or nine Properties of this great Sal|vation, that is offered unto you this Day.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, <HI>It is a free Salvation,</HI> ye have no more ado, but to put forth your Hand and take it: O come and take it: Chri&s;t hath fought for this Salvation, and there is no more required of you, but to come and reap the Fruits of his Victory: <HI>Who|ever will let him come,</HI> there is nothing that &s;hould move you to &s;tay away, <HI>O Cap|tives, Bond &s;laves to Satan, O Pri&s;oners of Hope,</HI> will ye come and partake of the great Salvation, what holds you from coming away and partaking of it, it is free|ly offered unto you: ay, believe it, Chri&s;t requires no more of you, but that ye &s;hould come and take it out of his Hand; <HI>if ye con&s;ent to obey,</HI> the Bargain is ended&punc; <HI>Ye &s;hall eat the good of the Land,</HI> I&s;ai. 1.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="003424_0008_0FF83C47D510D280">Secondly, This great Salvation, <HI>is a compleat Salvation,</HI> that is offered unto you to day; this is clear, Luke 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">1. <HI>That we might be &s;aved from our Enemies, and from the Hand of all that hate us.</HI> There is not any Enemy that is in thy Way, but if thou will come and partake of the great Salvation, thou may have Victory over it, &s;o compleat a Salvation is it that is in your Offer this Day. O &s;hall we pa&s;s a|way, and not embrace it: O &s;hall our cur&s;ed Hearts undervalue <HI>compleat at Sal|vation</HI> that is come to your Door, believe <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Salvation is near unto you,</HI> if ye will take <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></P>
<P>Thirdly, It is a <HI>wonderful Salvation,</HI> it is &s;uch a Salvation as to pry into it, and it is &s;uch a Salvation that all the Prophets de&s;ired to pry into it; It is almo&s;t &s;ix thou|&s;and Years &s;ince all the Angels in Heaven fell into a Sea of Wonder at this great Sal|vation: It is almo&s;t &s;ix thou&s;and Years &s;ince <HI>Abel</HI> fell into a Sea of Wonder at this great Salvation: And what think ye is his Exerci&s;e this Day? He is even won|dering at this great Salvation: Would ye ask at all the Angels in Heaven, would they not all &s;ay, O embrace the great Sal|vation? Would ye ask at all the Saints that are above, would they not advi&s;e you to embrace the great Salvation? Would ye ask at <HI>Adam,</HI> would he not &s;ay, O em|brace the great Salvation? Could ye ask at <HI>Abel,</HI> Would he not &s;ay, O embrace
<PB N="7" REF="003424_0009_0FF83C4A12EC21A8">
the great Salvation? And would not all the Patriarchs &s;ay unto you, O embrace the great Salvation? And do not all that have ta&s;ted of the Sweetne&s;s of it, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> out unto you, Come and embrace the great Salvation.</P>
<P>The fourth Property of his Salvation is, that it was bought at an exceeding dear Rate, <HI>it is a dear Salvation.</HI> Would ye know the Difference between Chri&s;t's coming to this Salvation, and your coming to it, it is this: Chri&s;t was forced to tra|vel through all the Armies of the Ju&s;tice of God: He was forced to drink of the Cup of the Wrath of God, before he could come to purcha&s;e this great Salvati|on; and now what is required of you to obtain this, we may &s;ay no more, but put out your Hands and take it: Will ye look to the Price that was laid down for this Salvation, there is not a Wound in the Body of Chri&s;t, but it is &s;aid, <HI>This is a dear Salvation.</HI> There is not a Reproach Chri&s;t met with, but it &s;aith, <HI>O is not this a dear Salvation!</HI> There is not a buffeting Chri&s;t met with, but it &s;aith, <HI>O is not this a dear Salvation</HI>! There is not a Nece&s;&s;i|ty that he was put into, but it &s;aith, <HI>Is not this a great and dear Salvation</HI>? O Sirs, will ye not come and take this great Salvation, this dear Salvation. What mu&s;t I give for it &s;ay ye? I &s;ay, ye mu&s;t give nothing for it, come and take it <HI>without Money, and without Price</HI>; it was dear un|to
<PB N="8" REF="003424_0010_0FF83C4C512AB6E0">
Chri&s;t, but it &s;hall be cheap unto you. O is it not cheap to you, I a&s;&s;ure you, if ye will come to the Market to buy the great Salvation, there is none of you that needeth to &s;tand for the Price of it. O come and take, and have it, and there &s;hall be no more prigging.</P>
<P>Fifthly, It is <HI>an everla&s;ting Salvation,</HI> that ye &s;hall enjoy the Fruits of through|out Eternity, as is clear, Heb. 9.13. <HI>He be|came the Author of eternal Redemption unto us.</HI> It is a Salvation that the Devil can never be able to take out of your Hand, if ye take it, ye &s;hall never be robbed of it again. O come and partake of this great Salvation, whereby the Gates of Hell &s;hall never prevail again&s;t you.</P>
<P>Sixthly, It is <HI>a noble and honourable Sal|vation,</HI> it is not to be taken out of one Slavery to another, but it is to be taken <HI>out of Pri&s;on that we may reign: Luke</HI> 1.71. compared with Ver&s;e 74. it is <HI>That we being &s;aved, may &s;erve him without Fear in Holine&s;s and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, all the Days of our Life.</HI> I &s;ay, Come, come, and par|take of this great Salvation, that your Glo|ry may be increa&s;ed, and that ye may be exalted above the Kings of the Earth.</P>
<P>Seventhly, It is a <HI>mo&s;t advantageous Sal|vation</HI> What are the Advantages of any Salvation that are not to be found in this? Is there not Peace to be found through this Salvation? Is there not Liberty to be found through this Salvation? Is there
<PB N="9" REF="003424_0011_0FF83C4EEA2CF388">
not eternal Enjoyment of God to be found in this Salvation? Yea, all Salvations are in this one Salvation.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, It is <HI>a royal Salvation,</HI> for it cometh to us from and through the Son of God. Chri&s;t is the Author of it, and we conceive, Chri&s;t may be &s;aid to be the Author of this Salvation, in the&s;e Re&s;pects, 1. He is the meritorious Cau&s;e that did procure it, it was the Price of his Blood that was laid down for to purcha&s;e this great Salvation. 2. He is the Fountain from whence it floweth, according to that Word which we have cited, Heb. 5.9. <HI>He is the Author of eternal Salvation.</HI> 3. He is the Per&s;on that fitteth our Spirits for partaking of it, and it is he that removeth Mountains out of the Way, that we may have fair Acce&s;s unto the great Salvation. 4. It is he that mu&s;t per&s;wade our Hearts to embrace and to take hold of it. He &s;tandeth without, and cryeth in to the Heart, to embrace the great Salvation; And he &s;tandeth within, making the Heart cry out; <HI>Content,</HI> I will embrace the great Salvation: He is indeed the Per&s;on that commendeth, and doth point forth this great Salvation unto us, he is the noble Mini&s;ter of it, it began fir&s;t to be preached by him.</P>
<P>Now, Is there any of you that have fal|len in love with the great Salvation? That ye may try your &s;elves, I &s;hall give you &s;ome Evidences of the Per&s;ons that are
<PB N="10" REF="003424_0012_0FF83C51CD1E8540">
near unto this great Salvation, 1. Is thy E&s;timation of the great Salvation increa&s;ed, beyond what it was in the morning when thou came hither? Is thy E&s;timation of the great Go&s;pel-Salvation a Foot higher than it was in the morning, I &s;ay unto thee, thou art not far from the great Sal|vation: Come away. 2. Is thy de&s;ire af|ter the great Salvation increa&s;ed beyond what it was in the morning? Ha&s;t thou &s;tronger De&s;ires after the great Salvation than before thou came hither? That is an Evidence thou art not far from it. 3. Is <HI>thy Thoughts of thy Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of the great Salvation greater than they were? Think|e&s;t thou that thou ha&s;t more need of the great Salvation than ever thou thoughte&s;t before. And is thy Opinion and Thoughts of &s;aving thy &s;elf le&s;s than they were before thou came&s;t hither? Art thou forced to cry out, <HI>None but Chri&s;t can &s;ave me</HI>? I &s;ay thou art not far from the great Salvation, Will thou come away? O that ye would once &s;eal this Conclu&s;ion with much Heart-Per&s;wa&s;ion, <HI>I am undone without Chri&s;t, I am undone without Chri&s;t,</HI> who is the Author of the great Salvation: Are there any of you that are &s;en&s;ible that ye are in the Fetters of Sin, and in the Bonds of Iniquity? Are ye brought to the Conviction of this, that ye are in the Gall of Bitterne&s;s? I &s;ay, if thou be brought to this Length, to be &s;en&s;ible of thy Bonds, and art crying out, <HI>O Redeemer, ha&s;ten and
<PB N="11" REF="003424_0013_0FF83C5357F88D08">
come away!</HI> I &s;ay, if thou be &s;en&s;ible of thy Bonds and Impri&s;onment, and crying out, <HI>O thou that was anointed from Eter|nity, to proclaim Liberty to the Captives, and the opening of the Pri&s;on to them that are bound.</HI> O ha&s;ten and come away, and redeem me, <HI>even poor me,</HI> &s;inking, &s;inning, peri&s;hing, &s;elf-de&s;troying <HI>me,</HI> thou art not far from the great Salvation. 4. Art thou a Per&s;on who beginneth to weep becau&s;e thou ha&s;t been &s;o long a Stranger to Chri&s;t, and the great Salvation? Old Men that are here, how long have ye been Stran|gers to the great Salvation, and to the Author of it? Now will ye &s;hed one Tear for your E&s;trangement, and cry out, Wo is me that Chri&s;t and I have been &s;o long a|&s;under? I &s;ay, if thou ha&s;t: come to that Length, thou art not far from the great Salvation, <HI>Come away</HI>: O pity your &s;elves, make ha&s;te and come away.</P>
<P>But now in the third Place, Let me give you &s;ome Evidences by which ye may know more clearly whether or no ye have embraced <HI>this great Salvation,</HI> that ye may know your &s;elves, and that ye walk not down to the Grave with a Lie in your right hand. The fir&s;t Evidence of a Per&s;on that hath embraced the great Salvation, is, that he will have a high E|&s;teem of the Saviour and Author of the great Salvation: Ha&s;t thou a matchle&s;s E&s;teem of matchle&s;s Chri&s;t the Saviour of the World, that is a &s;peaking Evidence
<PB N="12" REF="003424_0014_0FF83C54E39DD028">
unto thee, thou art a Partaker of the great Salvation: Art thou come to this Length that thou crie&s;t out, <HI>None but Chri&s;t, None but Chri&s;t</HI>? It is a &s;peaking Evidence that thou art come to be a Partaker of the great Salvation, when thou can cry out th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> Word, Exod. 15.2. <HI>The Lord is my Strength and my Song, he alone is become my Salvation.</HI> If Chri&s;t hath become thy Sal|vation then it is like he hath become thy Song. I would ask this of you, were ye ever brought this Length, that ye dur&s;t not adventure to prai&s;e Chri&s;t alone, but was forced to call in all the Creatures, and &s;ay, <HI>O magnify the Lord with me,</HI> O that is an Evidence that ye have embraced his Sal|vation.</P>
<P>Secondly, Tho&s;e who have embraced the great Salvation will &s;tudy to maintain and keep their Hold of it, they will &s;tu|dy to hold fa&s;t &s;o precious a Jewel, this is pre&s;s'd, Gal. 5.1. <HI>Stand fa&s;t in the Li|berty wherewith Chri&s;t hath made us free.</HI> Yea, they will &s;tudy to walk &s;uitably to to this noble Mercy, at lea&s;t they will &s;trive and endeavour to do it, as is al&s;o pre&s;s'd in that &s;ame Ver&s;e. I &s;ay, if thou ha&s;t been made a Partaker of the Go&s;pel of Salvation, thou wilt &s;trive to keep thy &s;elf from the Power of the&s;e Things that once triumphed over thee.</P>
<P>Thirdly, A Per&s;on that is a Partaker of the great Salvation will have a high E|&s;teem of this Mercy and Salvation; &s;o
<PB N="13" REF="003424_0015_0FF83C56F0571770">
<HI>Paul</HI> when he &s;peaketh of it here, he can|not but put &s;ome Note of Excellency to it, calling it, <HI>the great Salvation.</HI> Therefore, I &s;ay, if thou ha&s;t embraced the great Sal|vation, thou wilt have &s;o high E&s;teem of it, not to be &s;ubjected to it as thou &s;hould, or to be in Subjection to the Power of thy Lu&s;t in any Mea&s;ure, will be his Burden and Affliction; the Man will be &s;orry when he is brought forth from the Hou&s;e of his Bondage, unto the Red-Sea; he will be &s;orry, that when he &s;hould have Songs of Triumph over his Idols put into his Mouth, that they &s;hould &s;ing Songs of Triumph over him.</P>
<P>Fourthly. A Per&s;on that hath embraced the great Salvation, he will be longing &s;ometimes for the Day when this Salvati|on &s;hall be compleat, when he &s;hall &s;ing that Song, with that <HI>numberous Multitude which cannot be numbered,</HI> Rev. 7.9. O what a Day &s;hall it be, when thou &s;hall begin to &s;ing that Song: <HI>After this</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>I beheld, and lo, a great Multitude of all People, which no Man could number, of all People, Nations and Languages &s;tood before the Throne, and before the Lamb, cloathed with white Robes, and Palms in their Hands, and they cryed</HI>; and how cry|ed they? <HI>They cryed with a loud Voice:</HI> they would not mutter the Song, nor &s;ing &s;ilently, but <HI>cryed with a loud Voice:</HI> and what did they cry? they cryed with a loud Voice, <HI>Salvation unto our God, who
<PB N="14" REF="003424_0016_0FF83C5A1B082A80">
&s;itteth upon the Throne, and to the Lamb.</HI> I would only ask at you that are Partak|ers of the great Salvation, What Songs &s;hall be put into thy Mouth, when the Waters of <HI>Jordan</HI> &s;hall divide them&s;elves, <HI>that the ran&s;omed of the Lord might pa&s;s thorow</HI>? when thou &s;hall &s;ing that Song, P&s;al. 115.1. <HI>Not unto us, not unto us, but unto thee belongeth the Glory of our Salva|tion.</HI> O what a Day &s;hall that be, when that excellent Song &s;hall be put in thy Mouth; yea, what a Day &s;hall it be, when thou &s;halt be cloathed with the&s;e excel|lent Garments that are made mention of, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 6.10. for he hath cloathed thee with the <HI>Garments of Salvation,</HI> and he hath covered thee with the <HI>Robe of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s</HI> O what Robes are the&s;e? Did ye ever &s;ee &s;uch excellent Robes as the&s;e mu&s;t be? I think we &s;hall not know our &s;elves; O do you not think we &s;hall not know our &s;elves, when we &s;hall put on the&s;e excellent Robes? Now therefore, is the Bargain clo&s;ed; or will ye go away before ye take this great Salvation? Dare ye go out at the&s;e Doors and neglect the great Salvation? I would ask this of you, Think ye it will not be mo&s;t &s;ad, that Chri&s;t &s;hould tell this in Heaven of you to night, I was preached to a pack of Stones, that none of them would love me? Will ye not be afraid that this Report &s;hall be carried back to Heaven of you? For what Report can Chri&s;t carry back

but this? Now is the Cord of this great Salvation let down unto you, is there none of you that will take a hold of it, O will ye &s;eek after it, will ye make this a rejoycing Day in Heaven, that is a fa&s;t|ing Day unto you, and the Way to make it &s;o, is to embrace the great Salvation. Now what &s;ay ye to it old Men? Let me &s;peak to you, and ask your Thoughts of the great Salvation, Gray Hairs &s;hould be a Crown of Glory, if it be found in the Way of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, old Men &s;peak your Minds, that young Men may not have your bad Example: What &s;ay ye of this Salvation? Is it not a mo&s;t glorious Salvation, is it not a mo&s;t excellent Sal|vation that is in your Offer? I intreat you &s;peak your Minds, tell Chri&s;t ye are con|tent to take the great Salvation; other|wi&s;e, whoever he be that will not partake of this Go&s;pel Salvation; I in the Name and Authority of Chri&s;t our Ma&s;ter, de|nounce eternal and irrevocable War a|gain&s;t him. Put on your Harne&s;s, ye &s;hall not boa&s;t when ye put it off again, the Wrath and Fury of God &s;hall come upon you to the uttermo&s;t if ye embrace not this great Salvation: other Wars are but for a time: the greate&s;t Captains that ever the Earth did carry, are now <HI>laid down in the &s;ides of the Pit, and their Swords broken under their Heads.</HI> Armies of ten hundred thou&s;and, a hundred Years Time have laid them all in their Graves, and ended all

their Conte&s;ts, but there is no Di&s;charge of his War that &s;hall be concluded be|twixt Chri&s;t and you, it &s;hall become an eternal and mo&s;t terrible War, which &s;hall be but beginning when Time is ended: Now Peace or War, which of them will ye choo&s;e? Dare ye &s;end a Charge to Chri&s;t, and &s;ay ye will defy him? I am a|fraid there will be two Things that many of us &s;hall report to day. Fir&s;t, I am a|fraid there will be many that will give <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Report to the offer of the great Salvation, and &s;ay, <HI>Who is the Lord that I &s;hould obey him</HI>? I tell you who he is, He is <HI>glorious in Holine&s;s, fearful in Prai&s;es, doing Wonders.</HI> O embrace him before he go hence, and give not <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Re|port, le&s;t ye be drowned in the Sea of his Wrath, whence there &s;hall be no Reco|very.</P>
<P>Secondly, I fear there will be many here to day that will give <HI>Demas</HI>'s Re|port to this precious Offer: I will go and for&s;ake Chri&s;t, and embrace this pre|&s;ent World: O bad Exchange! cur&s;ed be he that &s;hall make it, will ye be of <HI>De|mas</HI>'s Humour? I fear there hath been many of that Humour of a long time: but I intreat you once to be wi&s;e before ye die. I confe&s;s that Proverb old Fools, are twice Fools; I think old Men that will not embrace the great Salvation, I think ye are triple Fools? What wait ye for? Is there any thing can afford you any Sa|tisfaction
<PB N="17" REF="003424_0019_0FF83C61677837B0">
but this great Salvation? Now are ye convinced old Men, that Chri&s;t is waiting for your An&s;wer? I intreat you before ye go hence, &s;peak your minds, what ye think of the great Salvation; Is it not a lovely Salvation, is it not lovely now? What &s;ay ye to it? I am to go a|way, and the Offer is to be taken up at this time, and it is hard to &s;ay if ever ye &s;hall have an Offer again. I would only &s;ay this to you, and be &s;ure of it, though I &s;hould never be a Partaker of this great Salvation, yet I &s;hall be a Witne&s;s again&s;t you that are not Partakers of it; I tell and declare unto you, I &s;hall be a Wit|ne&s;s again&s;t you if ye embrace not the great Salvation: Now old Men are ye per&s;waded to embrace it, Let me obte&s;t you <HI>by the Beauty of Chri&s;t,</HI> come and par|take of the great Salvation, ye that are travelling upon the Borders of Eternity. Now if ye will give no more, give this, will ye go home and think upon it; I &s;hall not be uncharitable, nor enter to judge your Thoughts: I fear there &s;hall be many declared and found Guilty a|mong us, that we declared unto Heaven we will not embrace the great Salvation, but have trod the Blood of the <HI>Son of God under Foot.</HI> Now I intreat you, every one of you ask at your &s;elves if ye be the Per|&s;ons that will <HI>pre&s;ume in your Hearts to do &s;o.</HI> Now I &s;hall leave it with you, let it not be a Witne&s;s again&s;t you.

leave it with this. O come away, old Men, young Men, old Women, and Maids, come and embrace this precious Go&s;pel Salvati|on. Ye may &s;ay, ye bid us come; but we cannot come. I de&s;ire no more of you, but to come with this; Lord I am content to come, but I cannot come. Come once to that, for if once ye be content to receive it, it will not be long before ye be able to receive it: Now &s;hall Chri&s;t depart, and will none of you &s;ay ye are content to take him? Will ye charge your own Con|&s;ciences with this, am I content to take Chri&s;t and the great Salvation. O ble&s;t, ble&s;t, ble&s;t, be he that is the Author of the great Salvation, and ble&s;t be he that gets any of the Ends of the Cord of the great Salvation, that we &s;ink not under the Wrath and Fury of the Lord; Come and embrace this great Salvation, and again I &s;ay, come and embrace it: For what can ye want if ye have it? I &s;hall &s;ay no more, but clo&s;e with that Word, I&s;ai. 62.21. <HI>Be|hold, the Lord hath proclaimed to the Ends of the World, to tho&s;e that are far off</HI>: what hath he proclaimed? <HI>Say ye to the Daugh|ter of Sion, behold thy Salvation cometh, be|hold it cometh.</HI> I &s;ay to you that are the Ends of the World, Salvation is brought near unto you: <HI>Stout-hearted and far from Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> the great Salvation is brought near unto you, and will ye &s;end it away?
