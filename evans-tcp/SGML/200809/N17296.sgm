<P>THE ingenuous &s;implicity, which re|commends the doctrines and precepts of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, forms a very plea&s;ing evidence of his de&s;ign to reform the world. Should an impartial &s;tranger con&s;ider the hi&s;to|ry of his religion at its mo&s;t favorable periods, he could hardly imagine that it had &s;o pure an origin; that the language of conde&s;cen&s;ion, and the &s;imple precepts of life, in&s;pired by an hope of immortality, could produce various and

contending &s;ects, who had lo&s;t all affection for each other, had neglected the be&s;t virtues of life, and had built their hopes of glory on zeal and contention. Still the melancholy proofs of &s;uch conduct have not prevented the belief, that no|thing could be more benevolent than the charac|ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Every thing kind flowed from his lips. He was born in humble life, and never ro&s;e in his di&s;tinctions beyond what hum|ble life could &s;ugge&s;t and comprehend. Affec|tion was recommended in every di&s;cour&s;e; points never debated with pa&s;&s;ion; the hi&s;tory of his religion, &s;o offen&s;ive to his countrymen, intimat|ed in parables; and every idea of limited de&s;ign excluded from his heart. Is it not time to re|cur to the in&s;tructions of this wi&s;e friend of man|kind, and to accept them uncorrupted by tradi|tions, creeds or councils? Should a preacher appear in this a&s;&s;embly, of venerable piety, of &s;imple manners, and with all the marks of hum|ble birth, and declare, as the introduction to his religious &s;ervice, a zeal for the mo&s;t important moral truths, and declare that by their fruits

men &s;hould be known; and to our text &s;hould he &s;ubjoin, Many will &s;ay to me, Lord, Lord, have we not prophecied in thy name, and in thy name done many wonderful works, and then I will profe&s;s to them, I never knew you; and &s;hould he clo&s;e with the memorable words which repre&s;ented only tho&s;e who obeyed his precepts as founded on a rock; could you &s;uppo&s;e his de&s;ign my&s;terious, or his doctrine partial, or illi|beral? Judge ye then of your&s;elves, what is right.</P>
<P>Let us then, in the con&s;ideration of the text, endeavour to obtain the mo&s;t obvious &s;en&s;e of the &s;everal expre&s;&s;ions, that we may be &s;ure of the general &s;entiment they contain.</P>
<P>What could he have intended, in &s;aying, that many would &s;ay, Lord, Lord? The words &s;ub|joined, very fully explain the intention. He that doth the will of my Father, &s;hall be pre|ferred. And the preten&s;ions of &s;uch per&s;ons are cited in the next ver&s;e, in which the exerci&s;e of even &s;upernatural powers is con&s;idered as in it&s;elf unavailing. We have corre&s;ponding ex|pre&s;&s;ions
<PB N="8" REF="022342_0006_0FB7ED7B761E6E60">
in Paul, who con&s;idered di&s;tinctly, all the evident endowments, of which the mind is capable, both miraculous and natural, and de|clared them in&s;ufficient without charity, which he defined to be practical godline&s;s, to de&s;erve the chri&s;tian character. They then, who cry, Lord, Lord, are they who do not obey the go&s;|pel, how far &s;o ever they may go in pretentions of affection for it. Though they hold the fir&s;t ranks, and the fir&s;t gifts in the church; if they have the mo&s;t commanding eloquence in deliv|ering truth to others, or the mo&s;t availing ex|ternal &s;anctity, to gain them re&s;pect and confi|dence: Yea, if God &s;hould even &s;upernaturally endue them for the mo&s;t noble ends of his providence; yet, if they have not a right, mor|al temper, the whole &s;hall not avail to place them among the meane&s;t of tho&s;e who have been obedient. What a check this is to the pre&s;umptuous, to the uncharitable, to the hypo|critical, and to the unfaithful! Heaven and happine&s;s were not de&s;igned by God as the exclu&s;ive rights of learned prie&s;ts, or ingenious

doctors; they are the end which God has pro|po&s;ed for all mankind, and are therefore, by the &s;ame means, attainable by all men. Riches and honors cannot en&s;ure the purcha&s;e; nei|ther can learning, pompous titles, re&s;pect nor dignity. Virtue alone is the moral happine&s;s of the world, and per&s;onal virtue alone &s;ecures heaven. Let then prie&s;ts declaim, this is &s;ure, that the increa&s;e of virtue is the increa&s;e of happine&s;s; and whatever &s;ound may be made in this world, virtue alone will di&s;tingui&s;h us in the next.</P>
<P>Having &s;een how our religious advantages may render us happy, by rendering us virtuous, let us, in the next place, inquire, what Je&s;us intended by doing the will of his Father. And he has &s;o connected his di&s;cour&s;e, that whatever &s;en&s;e may be applied to his words, in them&s;elves con&s;idered, they here admit only one explana|tion. When he announces his la&s;t ble&s;&s;ing, it is upon tho&s;e who keep the&s;e &s;ayings and do them; and the&s;e &s;ayings or precepts are the will
<PB N="10" REF="022342_0008_0FB7ED810B6BC078">
of God. As no new ritual is propo&s;ed, or doctrine which does not require action, &s;ome|thing to be done, we may &s;afely infer, that when he propounded his &s;alvation to his coun|trymen, propo&s;ed his own rewards, upon doing the will of God, he intended his command|ments. What the nature and extent of the&s;e commands were, he has determined by the pre|ceding parts of his di&s;cour&s;e; &s;o that his re|wards are offered to all who conformed to their conceptions of their moral obligations, and the foundation of his religion is placed in this di&s;|po&s;ition. For whatever con&s;i&s;ted in belief, pub|lic profe&s;&s;ion, and zeal, they were &s;uppo&s;ed to perform, while the mo&s;t important end of re|ligion was neglected.</P>
<P>Such as were obedient, were of the kingdom of heaven. This expre&s;&s;ion very frequently oc|curs, and never when it may not in &s;ome &s;en&s;e apply to the hi&s;tory of Chri&s;tianity. By &s;ome it has been thought to denote the commence|ment of a future &s;tate, but never is &s;o nece&s;&s;arily
<PB N="11" REF="022342_0009_0FB7ED890AEEB4C0">
limited to this &s;en&s;e, as to prevent its general de&s;ign to repre&s;ent the progre&s;s of Chri&s;tian truth in the world. When they, who do the will of God, are pronounced to be of the king|dom of heaven, it intends, that as to them, re|ligion has its true and mo&s;t acceptable effect: That the proper way to &s;ecure divine ble&s;&s;ing, was to obey, to act mo&s;t agreeably to our obli|gations, and from the be&s;t motives rea&s;on or revelation could furni&s;h. This obedience de|pends on our habitual inclination, connected with rea&s;onable pur&s;uits after knowledge. The different capacities of men may admit degrees of virtue, but all are con&s;i&s;tent with religious integrity.</P>
<P>From the &s;entiment of the text, it is then in|ferred, that all men are, and always have been, capable of &s;alvation. For if no external ad|vantages, or per&s;onal knowledge of a revelation, can avail, without an habitual di&s;po&s;ition to obedience, and this obedience is to be judged by its fruits, then this di&s;po&s;ition is preferred to
<PB N="12" REF="022342_0010_0FB7ED8ACDE357F8">
all tho&s;e advantages, in them&s;elves con&s;idered. And as the will of God implies the obligations of his creatures to all moral duties; &s;o far as they are &s;en&s;ible of them, and conform, they do, in their mea&s;ure, which is all that can be re|quired, perform his will, the end propo&s;ed in the kingdom of God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. This is an obvious doctrine of Je&s;us; and perhaps the rea&s;on why any have been taught to overlook it, has been, that it favors not tho&s;e comparative, if not exclu&s;ive advantages to which &s;ome pre|tend, as it certainly does not their hopes, who cry, Lord, Lord, with affected devotion, and for their accompli&s;hments, real or pretended, would be thought better than others, without any ju&s;t claims. When men can inform us of a more noble end in revelation, than to perfect the con&s;titutions which God has given us, we may &s;u&s;pect our argument; but when all the various opinions may accord with this end, in the judgments of their &s;everal advocates, we cannot be blamed for accepting the conclu&s;ion as free from their intricacies, or ab&s;urdities, as is
<PB N="13" REF="022342_0011_0FB7ED8C7B80A2B0">
po&s;&s;ible. For while objects and powers are &s;o admirably connected in the whole &s;y&s;tem, to make an ab&s;tru&s;e religion, in order to introduce a di&s;tinction, which is internal; &s;ince the exclu|&s;ive help attributed to the Chri&s;tian religion makes no outward di&s;tinction in the moral world, and the effects of the different motives may account for all we &s;ee, is to affront the &s;im|plicity of the Chri&s;tian faith. But by placing religion in &s;ober action, we are able to &s;ee how all men are accountable for their re&s;pective ad|vantages; and hereby we leave not God as a re&s;pecter of per&s;ons, and prevent not the equi|table di&s;tribution of his favors. God, we all know, has variou&s;ly be&s;towed his gifts upon the human race; in equal variety he may have be|&s;towed his moral as his other benefits; but as neither are in their relations unequal, and both may have a worthy end, there is no inju&s;tice with him. Without &s;uch &s;entiments, our mo&s;t evident conceptions of ju&s;tice may be violated.</P>
<P>What evidence &s;hould we con&s;ider as &s;uffici|ent to prove this to be a doctrine of the Chri&s;|tian
<PB N="14" REF="022342_0012_0FB7ED931A8C7A70">
religion? At the critical moment when this truth was to be declared, &s;hould an hea|then, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of devout re&s;pect to heaven, and exemplary in his life, be declared acceptable to God, and revelation a&s;&s;i&s;t this true light with miraculous te&s;timony, would it be conclu&s;ive? Can any evidence be better adapted? This we can produce, without any forced or critical con|&s;truction, in po&s;itive terms&punc; Peter was taught to call nothing unclean, becau&s;e the Jews thought other nations without the favor of God. Cornelius, a Roman officer in the province, was, for his devotion and alms, accepted of God. He was not pro&s;elyted to the Jewi&s;h religion, becau&s;e Peter &s;ays, it was unlawful to keep company with him. Yet upon this evidence Peter exclaims, Of a truth I perceive that God is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons, for in every nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righteou&s;ne&s;s, is accepted of him. Nor was this truth que&s;tion|ed in the di&s;putes re&s;pecting the u&s;e of the Hebrew ritual. If evidence, in &s;uch circum|&s;tances, produces not conviction, arguments may be applied in vain. And what a generous
<PB N="15" REF="022342_0013_0FB7ED94905E0870">
idea does this truth give us of God! He was the friend of I&s;rael, that in the end he might advance a univer&s;al religion; but for a di&s;tant good, he never di&s;regarded a pre&s;ent benefit. He knew the capacity he had given, and the &s;everal means by which it might be improved. He knew the di&s;tance of our mo&s;t pure concep|tions from truth, in all its relations, and could ea&s;ily pardon the little varieties in tho&s;e opin|ions, which were, at be&s;t, imperfect. If he took care for ravens, how much more would he take care of mankind! How much more acceptable is the hone&s;t devotion of an heathen, than the hypocri&s;y of a Chri&s;tian! How much more pure the charity of a &s;avage, than the pulpit-anathe|mas of a prie&s;t again&s;t churches which differ from his own. Blu&s;h, O Chri&s;tian, that thy il|liberal heart can call thy God to ju&s;tify thy in|&s;olent attacks on other men, and fear le&s;t thy fate, more mi&s;erable than their own, teach thee, with &s;orrow, to renounce the execrable idea.</P>
<P>And what may we infer more readily from this truth, than that the natural advantages of
<PB N="16" REF="022342_0014_0FB7ED96100549B0">
men con&s;titute their only probation? Their gratitude is to ari&s;e from ble&s;&s;ing they do really receive, their only devotion from the glory they behold, and their only obedience from the obli|gations they perceive. And do not our minds revolt, at the fir&s;t reflection, on any other con|&s;titution? Let mi&s;ery, in any degree, be in|crea&s;ed by the guilt of men, that they &s;hould not ri&s;e beyond the &s;trength of their powers in &s;uch &s;tate, is cur&s;e enough. But to &s;uperadd a gift which man has no natural power or incli|nation to accept, even when connected with his highe&s;t happine&s;s, is a policy unworthy the bounty of heaven. As revelation &s;hews us the motives adapted to &s;trengthen and improve our virtue, will not God direct the natural powers to the be&s;t advantage, if he intends a bounty? Our mo&s;t familiar ideas of goodne&s;s, e&s;pecially &s;uch as the go&s;pel recommends, a&s;&s;ure us of it, and we di&s;honor God by any other &s;uppo&s;ition. We are all his offspring.</P>
<P>We may al&s;o infer the original dignity of natural religion. For what good ends Chri&s;|tians
<PB N="17" REF="022342_0015_0FB7ED9972EC8790">
have &s;haken the foundations of their own religion, by depreciating natural religion, may not be ea&s;y to determine; but if the text is rightly explained, natural religion is &s;till the mo&s;t excellent religion. This con&s;i&s;ts in doing the will of God; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> inquiries may make it known to us, and our knowledge of its agree|ment with our nature confirms us in our affec|tion for it. Neither this law, nor its authority, is weakened by Chri&s;tianity; for as Chri&s;tianity has the &s;ame object, it can, at be&s;t, but claim to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in the knowledge, and confirm us in the practice of it. For to &s;uppo&s;e an original law &s;o defective in it&s;elf as not to be &s;ufficient to direct us, is to admit, at once, a defect in our con&s;titution, which is as di&s;honorable to God, as to charge him with changes in the con&s;titu|tion of any other part of nature, becau&s;e his original laws were not &s;ufficient. Revelation cannot then be admitted but as a part of the original plan, or rather as &s;uch a &s;pring as may act in &s;ub&s;erviency to the original law, till a variety of cau&s;es, wi&s;ely fitted to act, may ren|der
<PB N="18" REF="022342_0016_0FB7ED9B4B3A5808">
this a&s;&s;i&s;tance unnece&s;&s;ary. Chri&s;tianity is an help to recover the full force of natural law. The Son him&s;elf &s;hall then be put under, and God, by perfecting human nature, be all in all.</P>
<P>If this be true, there is not an ab&s;olute, but only a relative difference in the condition of men. Natural law is always right, Chri&s;tianity will a&s;&s;i&s;t men to go right. There is nothing beyond our conceptions in this view of Chri&s;|tianity. If God was plea&s;ed to con&s;titute us for happy, natural action in the pre&s;ent being, and yet render us capable of future life, but not place the evidence of this future life &s;o cer|tainly in our natural condition as not to admit other evidence, we may not doubt of the bene|fit, and that he is able to make the evidence appear wi&s;e and fit. And when it concurs with natural religion, by our pre&s;ent good, to promote our final good, it may a&s;&s;i&s;t &s;ome, while it offers no injury to others; and as all things may be in a progre&s;&s;ive &s;tate, it may, at &s;ome future time, be as univer&s;al as natural religion
<PB N="19" REF="022342_0017_0FB7ED9CC9B2C9C0">
it&s;elf. But whatever our opinions of &s;uch things may be, we &s;hould be careful not &s;o to frame them as to exclude natural law, and in|jure one of our fir&s;t and mo&s;t noble ideas of perfection, an impartial regard to the capacities of creatures which God has created for happi|ne&s;s. However we may magnify our relative advantages, let us leave all men &s;ufficient for wi&s;e action; and if our ju&s;t and exalted ideas of our own privileges do produce as ju&s;t and exalted improvements, we are more &s;ure not to be found among tho&s;e boa&s;ting profe&s;&s;ors, who have &s;aid much and done little, and may have our reward in ample glory for doing the will of God.</P>
<P>The practical u&s;e of our text &s;hould be, to teach us to place religion in tho&s;e things in which it really con&s;i&s;ts. However numerous our doctrines, whether &s;imple or my&s;terious; whether we receive all the dogmas of the Church or not, let us con&s;ider that we &s;hould produce good fruits. To have accurate and well defin|ed
<PB N="20" REF="022342_0018_0FB7EDA52BC9B780">
&s;entiments, is not unworthy of our mo&s;t &s;eri|ous attention. To be di&s;tingui&s;hed, may be mo&s;t laudable ambition. But let us not mi&s;take either of them for religion, without regard to our actions. All the orthodoxy in the world will not vindicate a di&s;hone&s;t man. If we be|lieve in &s;upernatural gifts, and that we po&s;&s;e&s;s them, let us doubt our religion, if we allow our&s;elves to violate ju&s;tice, defame or injure other men. However God may produce his de&s;ired regeneration in the mind, let it not have a vi&s;ionary, but an active operation, that we may &s;hew, out of a good under&s;tanding, the works of meekne&s;s and love. But all the exerci&s;es of in&s;trumental religion are not worth one good deed, and a di&s;hone&s;t act is more than a balance for them all. We cannot be too careful to a&s;|&s;i&s;t our virtue by the &s;imple in&s;titutions of re|ligion; the&s;e ought to have been done, and not the other left undone; but we are guilty of heinous iniquity, if we make them a cloke to our vices. Let us then reflect on the various duties of external religion, which we have at|tended
<PB N="21" REF="022342_0019_0FB7EDA756DAE420">
with &s;uch deception. How many &s;olemn &s;ounds without &s;ober thought! how many gra|cious words and ill actions! how many attempts to deceive by a&s;&s;umed gravity! how many tears in vain! and let us learn to de&s;pi&s;e &s;uch hypocri&s;y. Let the language of our counte|nances expre&s;s the cheerful devotion of our hearts. Let our gravity ari&s;e from a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of religious truth, and all our actions have an undi&s;puted te&s;timony to our &s;incerity. The cries, and groans, and complaints of dangerous errors, di&s;turb the weak, the credulous and &s;u|per&s;titious. But the &s;ingle act of inju&s;tice &s;peaks louder to a di&s;cerning man than all this cant and hypocri&s;y. When a man is found, who does not profe&s;s much, nor de&s;pi&s;e all, who is pure from guile, peaceable in his life, gentle in his manners, ea&s;ily di&s;&s;uaded from revenge, with an heart to pity and relieve the mi&s;erable, impartial in his judgement, and without di&s;&s;im|ulation, this is the man of religion. This is an apo&s;tolic de&s;cription of a good man; and what|ever opinions he may have, he ought to have &s;ome, and he has a right to chu&s;e for him&s;elf; this man is after God's own heart.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="022342_0020_0FB7EDA8D037DEE8">The candid &s;entiment of the text demands al&s;o a practical effect. The opinions of men belong to God, and the con&s;ciences of men are &s;ubject to no human tribunal. But wherever they have a virtuous effect, we ought in charity to &s;uppo&s;e the favor of God. When the Ma|homedan journies to Mecca, as his acts of &s;elf-denial &s;pring from his &s;erious belief, we have no authority to determine in God's &s;tead. But when we &s;ee his devotion, his zeal, and the acts of his unfeigned obedience, our affection &s;hould teach us with what tenderne&s;s the Uni|ver&s;al Parent views his creatures innocently err|ing before him. And we &s;hould di&s;mi&s;s all the partialities, which ari&s;e from our own particular connections. We &s;hould be particularly kind to virtue, wherever we may behold it; and prefer, in this regard, the di&s;tant &s;tranger, who practi&s;es it, to the child of our bo&s;om, who ne|glects it. By con&s;idering religion in this ami|able view, we may increa&s;e our love for it, and be induced to con&s;ider our&s;elves, not of &s;mall &s;ocieties only, under the formal obligations of
<PB N="23" REF="022342_0021_0FB7EDB0027F9278">
&s;ocial contracts, but as belonging to the hou&s;e|hold of the faithful, who dwell in every nation, and in every clime, with one God and Father, who hateth nothing that he has made, but loveth and cheri&s;heth it.</P>
<P>While we con&s;ider religion in connection with the unnumbered ceremonies of &s;uper&s;ti|tion, &s;pread in &s;trange confu&s;ion over the earth, we may be inclined to forget the reverence we owe to it, and de&s;pi&s;e the true excellence and glory of our nature. When we ob&s;erve how often the various incidents of life tear a&s;under the ma&s;k, and expo&s;e the dreadful features con|cealed under it, we may be induced to cur&s;e the religion which a&s;&s;i&s;ted the di&s;gui&s;e. But when we familiari&s;e the reflection, that true re|ligion is true virtue, and that it is only &s;uper|&s;tition which lends the fal&s;e appearance, we &s;hall dete&s;t the impo&s;ition, not more as an in&s;ult to man, than to religion it&s;elf. And how happy &s;hould we be, if we could attain that Chri&s;tian perfection, when we may love to appear what
<PB N="24" REF="022342_0022_0FB7EDB1D23C7500">
we are, and yet de&s;erve the character of true Chri&s;tians. We cannot be too cautious. A form of prayer will ea&s;ily pa&s;s upon us as de|votion. We may ea&s;ily mi&s;take our gifts for divine fervor, and pa&s;s on with our neighbours, and be as zealous as they, without the lea&s;t vir|tue. Our caution &s;hould increa&s;e with our danger, and we &s;hould remember, that our great obligation is to keep the heart with all dili|gence, &s;ince from that alone are the i&s;&s;ues of life.</P>
