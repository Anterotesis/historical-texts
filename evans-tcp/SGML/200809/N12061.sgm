<OPENER><SALUTE>BRETHREN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am now to &s;peak to you on &s;ome affairs which greatly concern us both, and I expect you will give me your attention, and act a becoming part upon the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>You know the treacherous and cruel part acted by &s;ome of your people at Log&s;town and about the Ohio two years ago; you <HI>then</HI> plundered umbers of the traders, who were &s;upplying you with goods;
<PB N="4" REF="015219_0003_0F9784D094B14590">
&s;ome of them you promi&s;ed to protect and &s;ave their effects, but you did not keep your words: &s;everal of the&s;e unhappy &s;ufferers are thereby reduced to great nece&s;&s;ity, &s;ome of whom are thrown into goal, be|cau&s;e they could not pay their debts.&mdash;This has in|duced them to apply to me, and to de&s;ire I would lay before you their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, that you might <HI>give them a tract of land to compen&s;ate in &s;ome mea&s;ure for their great lo&s;&s;es.</HI> I need not tell you, how incumbent it is upon you to agree to their de&s;ire, as you mu&s;t all be &s;en&s;ible they were ruined by &s;ome of your people in a time of peace, and when they were &s;upplying your nece&s;&s;ities: this conduct is &s;ufficient to make the traders very &s;hy of going towards your country; and therefore I think it indi&s;pen&s;ably your intere&s;t to <HI>grant</HI> their reque&s;t, which, <HI>though it will be but a &s;mall re|compen&s;e,</HI> will, however, &s;hew the world, that you re|pent of what is pa&s;t, and, like hone&s;t men, are de|&s;irous of making &s;ome re&s;titution for the damages you have committed. I expect you will, without delay, give me an an&s;wer, and I wi&s;h it may be a fa|vourable one, as it will be for your own credit.</P>
<P>BRETHREN,</P>
<P>The next thing I am to take notice of, is at the de&s;ire <HI>of the General,</HI> who commands all the army in this country: &mdash;he has repre&s;ented to me the nece&s;|&s;ity there is for the troops to have gardens and corn about the forts; and although it is the cu&s;tom in all other places, that all the ground within cannon-&s;hot &s;hall belong to the fort, he has yet &s;uch a regard for you, that he would <HI>not</HI> make any u&s;e of it without you were <HI>fir&s;t made acquainted, and approved of it.</HI> This is an in&s;tance of &s;o much goodne&s;s and conde&s;cen&s;ion, that I expect you will not he&s;itate a moment <HI>to give up the ground,</HI> within cannon-&s;hot round all the forts, for
<PB N="5" REF="015219_0004_0F9784D14E857010">
the u&s;e of the king's army; and I know you will the readier do that, as &s;uch ground &s;o near a fort can be of no u&s;e to you, as it is only intended for the &s;ervice of the garri&s;on:&mdash;but as the garri&s;on of Fort Pitt is larger than the re&s;t, and a great way from our &s;ettle|ments, I have no doubt but you will give up a larger quantity of ground there for the u&s;e of the &s;oldiers. And if you agree to this, I am per&s;uaded, they will look upon you in a much more friendly light than formerly: &s;o that I expect a &s;peedy and agreeable an&s;wer.</P>
<P>BRETHREN,</P>
<P>The la&s;t, but the mo&s;t important affair I have at this time to mention, is with regard <HI>to the &s;ettling a boundary between you and the Engli&s;h.</HI> I &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to &s;ome of your Nations &s;ome time ago, to acquaint you that I &s;hould confer with you at this meeting upon it. The king, who&s;e genero&s;ity and forgivene&s;s you have already experienced, being very de&s;irous <HI>to put a final end to di&s;putes between his people</HI> and <HI>you, concerning lands,</HI> and to do you &s;trict ju&s;tice, has fallen upon the plan of <HI>a boundary</HI> between our provinces and the Indians, (which no white man &s;hall dare to invade) as the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t method of ending &s;uch like di&s;putes, <HI>and &s;ecuring your property to you beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of di&s;turbance.</HI> This will, I hope, ap|pear to you &s;o rea&s;onable, and &s;o ju&s;t, on the part of the king, and &s;o advantageous to you and your po&s;terity, that I can have no doubt of your cheerfully joining with me, in &s;ettling &s;uch a di|vi&s;ion-line as will be be&s;t for the advantage of both the white men and the Indians, and as &s;hall be&s;t agree with the extent and increa&s;e of each pro|vince, and the governors, whom I &s;hall con&s;ult upon that occa&s;ion, &s;o &s;oon as I am fully impowered; but,
<PB N="6" REF="015219_0005_0F9784D20CDC3C80">
in the mean time, I am de&s;irous to know in what manner <HI>you would chu&s;e to extend it,</HI> and what you will agree heartily to, and abide by, in general terms: at the &s;ame time I am to acquaint you, that when|ever the whole is &s;ettled, and that it &s;hall appear you have &s;o far con&s;ulted the increa&s;ing &s;tate of our people, <HI>as to make any convenient ce&s;&s;ions of ground,</HI> where it is mo&s;t wanted, that then you will receive a con|&s;iderable pre&s;ent in return for your friend&s;hip.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>BROTHER WARRAGHIYAGEY, [<HI>Sir William John|&s;on's Indian name.</HI>]</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>We have heard all you &s;aid to us ye&s;terday, and we give you many thanks for your advice and directions to us, which we &s;hall take due notice of.</P>
<P>As we are willing to &s;hew our good di&s;po&s;ition by our actions, we &s;hall come into every thing you pro|po&s;e, that is rea&s;onable, and we hope it will render us more regarded by the Engli&s;h.&mdash;The&s;e are &s;erious ar|ticles, and we &s;hall con&s;ult both &s;achems and warriors about them, and by to-morrow be able to an&s;wer you upon them; but with regard to what you &s;poke to us about the king's de&s;ire, <HI>that we &s;hould agree about a line between us and the Engli&s;h,</HI> we mu&s;t de&s;ire to know of you how you intended <HI>the line</HI> &s;hould go, and how far.</P>
<P>Sir William an&s;wered,</P>
<P>BRETHREN,</P>
<P>I thank you for taking what I &s;aid into &s;erious con|&s;ideration.&mdash;With regard to what you de&s;ire to know concerning <HI>the line,</HI> if one &s;achem from each nation at|tends

early to-morrow morning, I &s;hall &s;peak farther upon that &s;ubject.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="speech">
<HEAD>On the 4th of May, the Onondaga &s;peaker addre&s;&s;ed Sir William as follows:</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>BROTHER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>We ye&s;terday opened our ears to what you &s;aid to us, and we have deliberated on it ever &s;ince. We now beg you will open your ears, and hearken to what we have to &s;ay in an&s;wer to it.</P>
<P><HI>Gave three &s;trings.</HI></P>
<P>BROTHER,</P>
<P>We have heard what you told us, concerning the intentions of the great king, <HI>about a line</HI> between us and the Engli&s;h, and we have con&s;idered, that &s;uch a thing will be very nece&s;&s;ary, provided the white people will abide by it.</P>
<P>BROTHER,</P>
<P>The chief cau&s;e of all the late wars <HI>was about lands.</HI>&mdash;We &s;aw the Engli&s;h coming towards us from all parts, and they have cheated us &s;o often, that we could not think well of it. We were afraid, that in a little time you would be at our very ca&s;tles; for this rea&s;on we thank the great king, for his good in|tentions, and we hope he will make his people keep within bounds, which they have not yet done: we therefore <HI>agree, that a boundary &s;hall be made between us,</HI> and that it &s;hall run from Fort Edward along to the Mohawks ca&s;tle, and from thence along the great mountain to Harris's Ferry on the river Sa&s;que|hanna, agreeable to what we have drawn here, on a piece of bark. <HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>BROTHER,</P>
<P>We have told you our minds; if it does not plea&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="015219_0007_0F9784D78C14E158">
you, it is none of our faults. We were always ready <HI>to give,</HI> but the Engli&s;h don't deal fairly with us; they are more cunning than we are; <HI>they get our names upon paper very fa&s;t,</HI> and we often don't know what it is for. We would do more to plea&s;e the king, but it is hardly in our power, and &s;ome of us don't like it, becau&s;e we are &s;o often impo&s;ed upon: one of our nations is going to be cheated out of al|mo&s;t all the land between the Mohawk and the Big River, by people at Albany, <HI>to whom they never publickly made any &s;uch grant,</HI> nor never received any thing for it. We &s;poke to you once before about it, and here are their chiefs now, who &s;ay, That &s;ince they fir&s;t heard of it, they were promi&s;ed ju&s;tice by the &s;everal governors at Albany long ago. They have likewi&s;e &s;poke to you on <HI>twelve</HI> different belts, and begged that you would get ju&s;tice for them, but it is not done; they &s;ent a belt over to the king about it,&mdash;but they have not yet had any &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>BROTHER,</P>
<P>You &s;ee how it is with us; if the Engli&s;h would be more hone&s;t, we &s;hould be more generous, and there would be peace all through the land; but it is hard, that one of our nations, that live &s;o near you<NOTE PLACE="foot">The Mohawks.</NOTE>, and have &s;uffered &s;o much on your account, &s;hould be &s;o greatly wronged.&mdash;This makes us apprehen|&s;ive, that the Engli&s;h will &s;oon &s;tretch their arm over our lands: we beg then, that you will &s;end our belts to the king, and tell him, how it is with us, and that we hope he will &s;et us a good example, and give the Mohawks their land &s;oon, before we &s;ettle any other matters; for our necks have been long &s;tretched out to hear from him, and if we don't hear &s;oon, &s;ome of our young people's heads will
<PB N="9" REF="015219_0008_0F9784D814BCC2F8">
begin to turn, and they won't regard what we &s;ay about peace; they'll tell us, it is not true, for if it was, <HI>our confederacy</HI> would obtain ju&s;tice, when they ap|plied for it.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>BROTHER,</P>
<P>We have fini&s;hed what we had to &s;ay for the pre&s;ent, and we hope you will an&s;wer us to-morrow upon it, at which time we &s;hall &s;peak to you on the other matters.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="speech">
<HEAD>On May the 5th, Sir William addre&s;&s;ed the Indians in the following manner:</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>BRETHREN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Your &s;peech ye&s;terday much &s;urpri&s;ed me:&mdash; you appeared de&s;irous to &s;et a <HI>boundary</HI> between the Engli&s;h and you, and &s;en&s;ible of the advantage of it; at the &s;ame time, you have de&s;cribed a boundary, which is ridiculous, and which &s;hews me, you don't mean what you &s;ay, and are not de&s;irous to pur&s;ue what has been recommended to you:&mdash;neither does it proceed from your ignorance; for you convinced me ye&s;terday by the remarks you made on the great map, that you are well acquainted with the whole country, and the &s;ituation of all the places on the frontiers. Notwith&s;tanding which you have, in your boundary, cut off a large tract of country, which you all knew has been <HI>long &s;ince purcha&s;ed and &s;ettled</HI>:&mdash; the land is patented one hundred miles beyond <HI>Fort Edward,</HI> and a great di&s;tance beyond the <HI>Mohawks Ca&s;tle,</HI> and the <HI>line</HI> you make from thence to Harris's Ferry, in&s;tead of adding to, cuts off &s;everal towns and &s;ettlements, particularly in Penn&s;ylvania, which
<PB N="10" REF="015219_0009_0F9784D8D4846D18">
you know <HI>has been fairly purcha&s;ed and allowed of by you,</HI> and to which <HI>you can make no claim,</HI> and you have taken no notice of the other governments. The af|fair of the Mohawks is of old &s;tanding, and I have never neglected it:&mdash;I can prove by papers I have here, that I laid it before Governor Clinton fifteen years ago, and that at the grand congre&s;s at Albany, in 1754, I did what I could for the Mohawks, who were promi&s;ed to have the matter &s;trictly examined into:&mdash;there is a patent for it, and it is not an ea&s;y matter to break it. The Mohawks have given me infinite trouble about it, ever &s;ince the report that it was to be &s;urveyed; it has not as yet affected their hunting, as it has never been &s;urveyed or &s;ettled; and I have &s;tated their complaints, and doubt not but they will be redre&s;&s;ed. That is the only large tract, which at pre&s;ent concerns them, and therefore I am &s;orry to find, you &s;hould make it any objection to the good work which the king recommends. The&s;e things require much time with white people; I have often recommended patience to them, and I wi&s;h they would follow my advice, and not interrupt a bu&s;ine&s;s which is of &s;o great importance. I wanted only at pre&s;ent to know your general &s;entiments upon this &s;ubject, and I wi&s;h they had been more favour|able, becau&s;e it would have been as much for your intere&s;t, as that of the Engli&s;h.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="speech">
<HEAD>To which the Six Nations <HI>then</HI> an&s;wered,</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>BROTHER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>We have heard you with attention, and we are much obliged to you for &s;hewing us what is be&s;t for our intere&s;t. We &s;hall therefore take it farther into con&s;ideration, becau&s;e we are willing to &s;hew our
<PB N="11" REF="015219_0010_0F9784D9909890D0">
good di&s;po&s;ition. We hope our behaviour on this occa&s;ion will have a proper effect upon the great king, and induce him to hearken to our complaints. We don't doubt, but you have done what you could for us, and we wi&s;h it may be taken notice of; other|wi&s;e we mu&s;t think our&s;elves greatly wronged, and our minds cannot be at peace.&mdash;To-morrow we &s;hall an&s;wer you more particularly and to your &s;atisfaction.</P>

<P>I would wi&s;h you all to enter with cheerfulne&s;s in|to the bu&s;ine&s;s your brother <HI>Warraghiyagey</HI> has re|commended to you, and to do it from your hearts.

hope we &s;hall now plea&s;e you better, and we beg you will attend to our an&s;wer, and pardon our mi&s;takes and the manner of our expre&s;&s;ion, as we have always been accu&s;tomed to &s;peak our thoughts freely, the rather as we heard from the <HI>French,</HI> that you had de|&s;igns upon us, and we heard from <HI>you, that they</HI> had the &s;ame, <HI>but of late we find you both had the like motives.</HI></P>
<P>At length we have agreed together for our&s;elves, our wives and children, <HI>to make a ce&s;&s;ion to the king,</HI> of the lands we &s;hall now de&s;cribe, beginning at Owegi, on the ea&s;t branch of Sa&s;quehanna, thence down the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river to Shamokin (or Fort Augu&s;ta), and running up the we&s;t branch of Sa&s;quehanna, on the &s;outh &s;ide thereof, and from thence to Kittaning, or Adigo on the Ohio, thence along and down the Ohio to the Cherokee River, and up the &s;ame to its head, <HI>on this &s;ide</HI>; upon condition that you have &s;ome re|gard for our Warriors, who always pa&s;s through that country, and give them always a free pa&s;&s;age; and we are very happy in being all a&s;&s;embled here, both &s;achems and warriors, at this time, and not as has been formerly the ca&s;e, on &s;uch occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>We can now all act together, <HI>as all &s;hould receive a &s;hare for what they have ceded,</HI> by which it will be pre&s;erved in our minds. We have never refu&s;ed you lands. In many places we have given proofs of our friend&s;hip, on which we have been promi&s;ed a recom|pen&s;e which we have not received. We a&s;&s;i&s;ted your army la&s;t year, and many of our people were for|&s;aken and left to fami&s;h, and we have been promi&s;ed a large trade, and to fix interpreters, &amp;c. at each po&s;t, which is not come as yet.

<P>You all, I am hopeful, recollect the rea&s;ons I then gave you for making <HI>&s;uch a boundary</HI>; neverthele&s;s, I &s;hall again repeat them:&mdash;You know, brethren, <HI>that the encroachments upon your lands</HI> have been always one of your principal &s;ubjects of complaint; and that, &s;o far as it could be done, endeavours have not been wanting for your obtaining redre&s;s. But it was a difficult ta&s;k, and generally un&s;ucce&s;sful; for al|though the provinces have bounds between each other, there are no certain bounds between them and you; and thereby, not only &s;everal of our people, ignorant in Indian affairs, have advanced to far <HI>into your country,</HI> but al&s;o many of your own people, through the want of &s;uch a line, <HI>have been deceived in the &s;ales they have made,</HI> or in the limits they have &s;et to our re&s;pective claims.&mdash;This, brethren, is a &s;ad ca&s;e, which has frequently given us much trouble, and turned many of your heads; but it is likely to continue &s;o, until &s;ome bounds are agreed to, fixed upon, and made public between us.&mdash;The great, the good king of England, my ma&s;ter, who&s;e friend|&s;hip and tender regard for your intere&s;ts I wi&s;h you may ever hold in remembrance, has, among&s;t other in&s;tances of his goodne&s;s, after long deliberation on

<HEAD>Coun&s;ellor <HI>DAGGE's</HI> Opinion on the <HI>Indian</HI> Grant of Lands to <HI>William Trent,</HI> and others, <HI>viz.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE writers on juri&s;prudence agree in the pro|po&s;ition <Q>that the original right to all kinds of property aro&s;e from pre-occupancy, and that in a &s;tate of nature every one might po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of, and retain any vacant &s;ubject.</Q></P>
<P>The fir&s;t occupant had a right to grant, cede, or transfer the &s;ubject he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of, to &s;uch per&s;ons, and upon &s;uch terms, as he thought proper; and if before &s;uch grant, ce&s;&s;ion or transfer the occupant died, his property de&s;cended to his children. The <HI>right</HI> of tran&s;mitting property always re&s;ided in the owner, and civil in&s;titutions only pre|&s;cribed the <HI>mode</HI> of carrying that right into effect.</P>
<P>In that period of &s;ociety when countries were formed, and their boundaries fixed, we find that dif|ferent di&s;tricts were appropriated to the native owners, the fir&s;t occupants, or in ca&s;e of vacant or derelict lands, to the fir&s;t di&s;coverers. From tho&s;e original proprietors each country was tran&s;mitted to other
<PB N="41" REF="015219_0040_0F9784F553C64568">
proprietors, by the con&s;ent or by the conque&s;t of the pre&s;ent owners.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e under con&s;ideration, I am of opinion that the Indians of the Six Nations appear to have been entitled to the lands in que&s;tion from pre-occu|pancy, or from conque&s;t, but however their right accrued, they are acknowledged in expre&s;s words by the deed of ce&s;&s;ion to the crown, made at Fort Stan|wix, November 5th, 1768, to have been at that time <HI>the true and ab&s;olute proprietors</HI> of the lands in que&s;tion; and &s;o they were al&s;o acknowledged to be in the publick negociations between England and France, in the year 1755, and &s;o <HI>al&s;o,</HI> as is &s;tated in the ca&s;e, &s;everal treaties of peace and commerce entered into with particular nations or tribes of Indians by the Engli&s;h nation, con&s;ider and treat the natives or oc|cupiers as the lawful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors and owners of the countries they re&s;pectively occupy.</P>
<P>The deed of ce&s;&s;ion to the crown, on the 5th of November, 1768, was made in con&s;ideration of &pound; 10, 460:7:3 &s;terling, then paid to the Six United Nations, and for <HI>other con&s;iderations</HI> mentioned and expre&s;&s;ed <HI>in that deed and the treaties previous and pre|paratory to it.</HI></P>
<P>This deed of ce&s;&s;ion, the conveyance to Mr. Trent, and the treaties in 1765 and 1768, mu&s;t be con|&s;idered together, as they all tend to illu&s;trate the whole tran&s;action, and explain the intention of the contracting parties: And taking the whole under con&s;ideration, it appears&mdash;That the Six United Na|tions were truly &s;en&s;ible of the great lo&s;s the traders had &s;u&s;tained by the treachery and depredations of
<PB N="42" REF="015219_0041_0F9784F67A5307C0">
&s;ome of their tributary or dependant tribes&mdash;That a requi&s;ition was made to the Six United Nations in May 1765 for a grant of land by way of compen|&s;ating in &s;ome mea&s;ure for the damages the traders had &s;u&s;tained by the depredations of their dependants or tributary Indians&mdash;That the Six Nations, after deliberating from the 2d of May, when this requi|&s;ition was made, to the 6th of May, <HI>they agreed that the reque&s;t of the traders &s;hould be complied with, and that they would grant</HI> them <HI>&s;ome lands</HI> near Fort Pitt. That at the congre&s;s and treaty in November 1768, held at Fort Stanwix, the chiefs and &s;achems of the Six United Nations again took this matter under their con&s;ideration, and upon the fir&s;t day of that month expre&s;sly declared, that <Q><HI>in order to &s;hew that they</HI> loved ju&s;tice, they expected, that the traders who &s;uffered by &s;ome of their dependants in the war five years &s;ince, might have a grant for the lands they then gave them down Ohio, as a &s;atisfaction for their lo&s;&s;es.</Q></P>
<P>On the 3d day of the &s;ame month of November, the Six Nations, by their &s;achems and chiefs, exe|cuted the conveyance to Mr. Trent; which proceeds upon a recital, that he had been impowered by &s;e|veral letters of attorney from the &s;uffering traders named in the &s;aid deed, to a&s;k, &s;olicit, demand and receive from the Six Nations a grant of a tract of land as a &s;atisfaction, compen&s;ation or retribution for the goods, merchandize and effects of the &s;aid Wil|liam Trent, and of the &s;aid &s;everal traders which the &s;aid Shawne&s;&s;e, Delaware and Huron tribes, tributaries of the &s;aid Six Nations (contrary to all good faith, and in violation of their repeated promi&s;es of &s;afety and protection to the traders, their &s;ervants and effects, while trading in their country) did violently

&s;eize upon, and unju&s;tly appropriate to their own u&s;e.&mdash;The deed then declares, that in con&s;ideration of the Sum of &pound; 85, 916:1:8, lawful money of the province of New-York, the &s;ame being the amount of the goods and merchandize which were unju&s;tly &s;eized and taken from the traders as afore&s;aid, whereof ju&s;t and fair accounts on oath and affirmation had been produced, interpreted and explained to them, and which at their de&s;ire were then lodged and depo&s;ited with the &s;aid Sir William John&s;on.&mdash;The chiefs and &s;achems of the &s;aid Six United Nations, for the &s;aid con&s;iderations, and in con&s;ideration of five &s;hillings, did give, grant, bargain and &s;ell unto his maje&s;ty, his heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, to and for the only u&s;e, benefit and behoof of the &s;aid William Trent, in his own right, and as attorney afore&s;aid, all that tract of land de&s;cribed in the conveyance. To hold unto his maje&s;ty, his heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, but to and for the only u&s;e, benefit and behoof of the &s;aid William Trent, in his own right, and as attorney afore&s;aid, his heirs and a&s;&s;igns for ever. This deed of conveyance &s;eems to have been executed in the mo&s;t publick manner, in the pre&s;ence of the king's governor of New-Jer&s;ey, and the commi&s;|&s;ioners from Virginia and Penn&s;ylvania, and &s;everal other per&s;ons who attended the congre&s;s, and at|te&s;ted the execution of this conveyance, which by that means received every degree of &s;olemnity and &s;anction.</P>
<P>On the 5th day of the &s;ame month of November, 1768, the &s;aid chiefs and &s;achems executed their deed of ce&s;&s;ion to his maje&s;ty, of a large tract of country upon the river Ohio. In this deed of ce&s;&s;ion the Indians expre&s;sly &s;tipulate <HI>that their pre&s;ent grants</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="015219_0043_0F9784F860D3C730">
[which words are explained in the minutes of con|gre&s;s of November 5th, where the traders deed is mentioned with the other grants then made] <Q>&s;hould be deemed valid on their parts,</Q> and they convey to the king, not only in con&s;ideration of the pre&s;ent then made, and the money then paid by the king, amounting to &pound; 10,460:10:3, but al&s;o <HI>for the other con&s;iderations in the deed before mentioned</HI>&mdash;And the Ha|bendum is to the king, his heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, <HI>under the re&s;ervation made in the treaty</HI>&mdash;So that the deed of ce&s;&s;ion to the king <HI>virtually confirms</HI> the con|veyance to Mr. Trent. Upon the whole, I am of opinion, that Mr. Trent, in his own right, and as attorney for the traders, <HI>hath a good, lawful and &s;uf|ficient title to the land</HI> granted by the &s;aid deed of con|veyance, &s;ubject <HI>only</HI> to the king's &s;overeignty over the &s;ettlements to be e&s;tabli&s;hed thereon, and over the inhabitants, as Engli&s;h &s;ubjects.</P>

<P>I Entirely concur with Mr. Dagge in his opinion on <HI>this</HI> ca&s;e. The property of the &s;oil conveyed to Mr Trent, for him&s;elf and as attorney, was cer|tainly in the Six Nations, and as incident to that pro|perty, they had a power of alienating and transferring in <HI>any</HI> manner, or to any per&s;ons, unle&s;s they had been re&s;trained by their own laws.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e the &s;upreme power of the country re|&s;ided
<PB N="45" REF="015219_0044_0F9784F90E139788">
in the &s;ellers, who had therefore an ab&s;olute power of alienating; and the tran&s;action being fair and open, and for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of doing an act of publick ju&s;tice, mu&s;t bind the Six Nations in good faith. If we &s;uppo&s;e, that the &s;overeignty of the land &s;till remained in the Six Nations, the pro|perty of the &s;oil mu&s;t be in the grantee Mr. Trent, and <HI>cannot</HI> without violence and inju&s;tice be taken from him. The very act however of the &s;overeign power of the Six Nations admits a capacity in the grantee, to take under the deed, according to their laws, or u&s;age, and there is no law, that I ever heard of, that re&s;trains the &s;ubjects of the crown of England from purcha&s;ing in foreign dominions. The inten|tion of the parties here appears to have been to transfer the &s;overeignty to the crown of England by the &s;ame in&s;trument <HI>whereby</HI> the land was con|veyed. If that transfer of the &s;overeignty is effectual, it pa&s;&s;ed, and is confirmed by the deed of ce&s;&s;ion to the crown, dated two days after; but &s;ubject, however, to all the antecedent rights of property, the crown being entitled <HI>only</HI> to the immediate property of vacant and unappropriated lands; but in <HI>this</HI> ca&s;e the lands are abandoned by the proprietors, and con|veyed to the grantee.&mdash;If the crown had an original &s;overeignty, &s;till the &s;oil being the property of the Six Nations, they and their alienee &s;hould be pro|tected by that &s;overeignty <HI>in their property.</HI> If the crown acquired the &s;overeignty by the grant to Mr. Trent, or by the deed of ce&s;&s;ion, the title of the grantee is then under the protection of the laws of England.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I am of opinion, that in every way of con&s;idering this ca&s;e, the grant to Mr. Trent
<PB N="46" REF="015219_0045_0F9784FA837B9A00">
is good, &s;ufficient and lawful; and is under the pro|tection of the laws of England.</P>
