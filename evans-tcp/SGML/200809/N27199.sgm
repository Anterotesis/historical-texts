<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>A REQUEST was made to me &s;ome years ago by my pupils, to publi&s;h the fol|lowing lectures. I declined complying with it, becau&s;e I did not think them fit for the public eye; but a more importunate applica|tion of the gentlemen who attended them la&s;t year, has prevailed upon me to commit them to the pre&s;s in their pre&s;ent imperfect &s;tate. The reader will &s;oon perceive, that I di&s;claim being the author of the great and original con|ception upon which they are founded. I have done but little more than carry the hod, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in completing part of a fabric, the foun|dations of which were laid by two of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed ma&s;ter builders in medi|cine of the eighteenth century.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="036255_0004_100865D6A12CAD00">
I have endeavoured to render the facts and principles contained in the&s;e lectures, intelli|gible to gentlemen of all profe&s;&s;ions as well as to phy&s;icians. This attempt to diffu&s;e medi|cal knowledge more generally, has been made nece&s;&s;ary, by the controver&s;ies about &s;y&s;tems of medicine, and remedies, which now di|vide the phy&s;icians of every part of the world. They can never be &s;ettled, but by men who do not trade in phy&s;ic, and who will not be actuated in deciding upon medical que&s;tions, by an improper competition for intere&s;t, or fame.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE I.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY bu&s;ine&s;s in this chair is to teach the in&s;ti|tutes of medicine. They have been divided into Phy&s;iology, Pathology, and Therapeutics. The objects of the fir&s;t are, the laws of the human bo|dy in its healthy &s;tate. The &s;econd includes the hi&s;tory of the cau&s;es, and &s;eats of di&s;ea&s;es. The &s;ubjects of the third, are the remedies for tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es. In entering upon the fir&s;t part of our cour&s;e, I am met by a remark delivered by Dr. Hunter in his introductory lectures to his cour&s;e of anatomy. "In our branch (&s;ays the Doctor) tho&s;e teachers who &s;tudy to captivate young minds with ingenious &s;peculations, will not leave a repu|tation
<PB N="2" REF="036255_0008_100865E1C98A3708">
behind them that will outlive them, half a century. When they cea&s;e from their labours, their labours will be buried along with them. There never was a man more followed, and admir|ed in phy&s;iology, than Dr. Boerhaave. I remem|ber the veneration in which he was held. And now, in the &s;pace of forty years,&mdash;his phy&s;i|ology is&mdash;it &s;hocks me to think, in what a light it appears."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lect. xi. p. 98.</NOTE> Painful as this premonition may be to the teachers of phy&s;io|logy, it &s;hould not deter them from &s;peculating upon phy&s;iological &s;ubjects. Simple anatomy is a ma&s;s of dead matter. It is phy&s;iology which infu&s;es life into it. A knowledge of the &s;tructure of the hu|man body, occupies only the memory. Phy&s;iology introduces it to the higher, and more noble faculties of the mind. The component parts of the bo|dy, may be compared to the materials of a hou&s;e, lying without order in a yard. It is phy&s;iology, like a &s;kilful architect, which connects them together, &s;o as to form from them an elegant, and u&s;eful build|ing. The writers again&s;t phy&s;iology, re&s;emble in one particular, the writers again&s;t luxury. They for|get that the functions they know, and de&s;cribe, be|long to the &s;cience of phy&s;iology; ju&s;t as the declaim|ers again&s;t luxury, forget that all the conveniences
<PB N="3" REF="036255_0009_100865E42E598E08">
which they enjoy beyond what are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t &s;imple &s;tage of &s;ociety, belong to the luxuries of life. The anatomi&s;t who de&s;cribes the circula|tion of the blood, acts the part of a phy&s;iologi&s;t, as much as he does, who attempts to explain the functions of the brain. In this re&s;pect Dr. Hunter did honor to our &s;cience; for few men ever explain|ed that &s;ubject, and many others equally phy&s;iolo|gical, with more per&s;picuity and eloquence, than that illu&s;trious anatomi&s;t. Upon all new and diffi|cult &s;ubjects, there mu&s;t be pioneers. It has been my lot to be called to this office of hazard, and drudgery; and if in di&s;charging its duties, I &s;hould meet the fate of my predece&s;&s;ors, in this branch of medicine, I &s;hall not peri&s;h in vain. My errors, like the bodies of tho&s;e who fall in forcing a breach, will &s;erve to compo&s;e a bridge for tho&s;e who &s;hall come after me, in our pre&s;ent difficult enterpri&s;e. This con&s;ideration, aided by ju&s;t views of the na|ture, and extent of moral obligation, will overba|lance the evils anticipated by Dr. Hunter, from the lo&s;s of po&s;thumous fame. Had a prophetic voice whi&s;pered in the ear of Dr. Boerhaave in the evening of his life, that in the &s;hort period of forty years, the memory of his phy&s;iological works would peri&s;h from the earth; I am &s;atisfied, from the knowledge we have of his elevated genius and
<PB N="4" REF="036255_0010_100865E67ABB1090">
piety, he would have treated the prediction with the &s;ame indifference, that he would have done, had he been told, that in the &s;ame time, his name &s;hould be era&s;ed from a pane of gla&s;s, in a noi&s;y and vulgar country tavern.</P>
<P>The &s;ubjects of the lectures I am about to deliver, you will find in a &s;yllabus which I have prepared, and publi&s;hed, for the purpo&s;e of giving you a &s;uc|cinct view of the extent, and connection of our cour&s;e. Some of the&s;e &s;ubjects will be new in lec|tures upon the in&s;titutes of medicine, particularly tho&s;e which relate to morals, metaphy&s;icks, and theology. However thorny the&s;e que&s;tions may ap|pear, we mu&s;t approach and handle them; for they are intimately connected with the hi&s;tory of the faculties, and operations of the human mind; and the&s;e form an e&s;&s;ential part of the animal oeconomy. Perhaps it is becau&s;e phy&s;icians have hitherto been re&s;trained from inve&s;tigating, and deciding upon the&s;e &s;ubjects, by an erroneous belief that they be|long exclu&s;ively to another profe&s;&s;ion; that phy&s;io|logy has &s;o long been an ob&s;cure, and conjectural &s;cience.</P>
<P>In beholding the human body, the fir&s;t thing that &s;trikes us, is its LIFE. This, of cour&s;e &s;hould
<PB N="5" REF="036255_0011_100865E8021B5A38">
be the fir&s;t object of our inquiries. It is a mo&s;t im|portant &s;ubject; for the end of all the &s;tudies of a phy&s;ician is to pre&s;erve life; and this cannot be perfectly done, until we know in what it con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>I include in animal life as applied to the human body, <HI>motion</HI>&mdash;<HI>&s;en&s;ation</HI>&mdash;and <HI>thought.</HI> The&s;e three, when united, compo&s;e perfect life. It may exi&s;t without thought, or &s;en&s;ation; but neither &s;en&s;a|tion, nor thought, can exi&s;t without motion. The lowe&s;t grade of life, probably exi&s;ts in the ab&s;ence of even motion, as I &s;hall mention hereafter. I have preferred the term <HI>motion</HI> to tho&s;e of o&s;cil|lation, or vibration which have been employed by Dr. Hartley in explaining the laws of animal matter; becau&s;e I conceived it to be more &s;imple, and better adapted to common apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>In treating upon this &s;ubject, I &s;hall fir&s;t con&s;ider animal life as it appears in the waking, and &s;leeping &s;tates in a healthy adult, and &s;hall afterwards in|quire into the modification of its cau&s;es, in the foetal, infant, youthful, and middle &s;tates of life, in certain di&s;ea&s;es, in different &s;tates of &s;ociety, in different climates, and in different animals.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin, by delivering three general propo&s;i|tions.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="036255_0012_100865EA6BD20098">
I. Every part of the human body (the nails and hair excepted) is endowed with &s;en&s;ibility, or exci|tability, or with both of them. By &s;en&s;ibility is meant the power of having &s;en&s;ation excited by the action of impre&s;&s;ions. Excitability denotes that property in the human body, by which motion is excited by means of impre&s;&s;ions. This property has been called by &s;everal other names, &s;uch as, irri|tability, contractility, mobility, and &s;timulability. I &s;hall make u&s;e of the term excitability, for the mo&s;t part, in preference to either of them. I mean by it, a capacity of imperceptible, as well as obvious motion.&mdash;It is of no con&s;equence to our pre&s;ent in|quiries, whether, this excitability be a quality of animal matter, or a &s;ub&s;tance. The latter opinion has been maintained by Dr. Girtanner, and has &s;ome probability in its favor.</P>
<P>II. The whole human body is &s;o formed, and connected, that impre&s;&s;ions made in the healthy &s;tate upon one part, excite motion, or &s;en&s;ation, or both, in every other part of the body. From this view, it appears to be an unit, or a &s;imple and in|divi&s;ible quality, or &s;ub&s;tance. Its capacity for re|ceiving motion, and &s;en&s;ation, is variou&s;ly modified by means of what are called, the &s;en&s;es. It is exter|nal,
<PB N="7" REF="036255_0013_100865ED8AD46A48">
and internal. The impre&s;&s;ions which act upon it, &s;hall be enumerated in order.</P>
<P>III. Life is the EFFECT of certain &s;timuli acting upon the &s;en&s;ibility, and excitability which are ex|tended in different degrees, over every external, and internal part of the body. The&s;e &s;timuli are as nece&s;&s;ary to its exi&s;tence, as air is to flame. Animal life is truly (to u&s;e the words of Dr. Brown) "a forced &s;tate." I have &s;aid, the <HI>words</HI> of Dr. Brown; for the opinion was delivered by Dr. Cullen in the Univer&s;ity of Edinburgh in the year 1766, and was detailed by me in this &s;chool, many years before the name of Dr. Brown was known as a teacher of medicine. It is true, Dr. Cullen afterwards de&s;ert|ed it; but it is equally true, I never did; and the belief of it, has been the foundation of many of the principles, and modes of practice in medicine which I have &s;ince adopted. In a lecture which I deliver|ed in the year 1771, I find the following words, which are taken from a manu&s;cript copy of lectures given by Dr. Cullen upon the in&s;titutes of medi|cine. "The human body is not an automaton, or &s;elf-moving machine; but is kept alive, and in mo|tion by the con&s;tant action of &s;timuli upon it." In thus a&s;cribing the di&s;covery of the cau&s;e of life which I &s;hall endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h, to Dr. Cullen; let it not be &s;uppo&s;ed, I mean to detract from the
<PB N="8" REF="036255_0014_100865EF0F384938">
genius, and merit of Dr. Brown. To his intrepidity in reviving, and propagating it, as well as for the many other truths contained in his &s;y&s;tem of medi|cine po&s;terity, I have no doubt, will do him ample ju&s;tice, after the errors that are blended with them, have been corrected, by their un&s;ucce&s;sful applica|tion to the cure of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Agreeably to our la&s;t propo&s;ition, I proceed to remark, that the action of the brain, the dia&s;tole, and &s;y&s;tole of the heart, the pul&s;ation of the arte|ries, the contraction of the mu&s;cles, the peri&s;taltic motion of the bowels, the ab&s;orbing power of the lymphatics, &s;ecretion, excretion, hearing, &s;eeing, &s;melling, ta&s;te, and the &s;en&s;e of touch, nay more, thought it&s;elf, are all the effects of &s;timuli acting upon the organs of &s;en&s;e and motion. The&s;e &s;timuli have been divided into external, and internal. The external are light, &s;ound, odors, air, heat, exer|ci&s;e, and the plea&s;ures of the &s;en&s;es. The inter|nal &s;timuli are food, drinks, chyle, the blood, a certain ten&s;ion of the glands, which contain &s;ecret|ed liquors, and the exerci&s;es of the faculties of the mind; each of which I &s;hall treat in the order, in which they have been mentioned</P>
<P N="1">1. Of external &s;timuli. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is light. It is remarkable that the progenitor of the human
<PB N="9" REF="036255_0015_100865F19FF06FF8">
race was not brought into exi&s;tence until all the lumi|naries of heaven were created. The fir&s;t impul&s;e of life, was probably imparted to his body by means of light. It acts chiefly through the medium of the or|gans of vi&s;ion. Its influence upon animal life is fee|ble, compared with &s;ome other &s;timuli to be mention|ed hereafter; but it has its proportion of force.&mdash;Sleep has been &s;aid to be a tendency to death; now the ab&s;ence of light we know invites to &s;leep, and the return of it excites the waking &s;tate. The late Mr. Rittenhou&s;e informed me, that for many years he had con&s;tantly awoke with the fir&s;t dawn of the morning light, both in &s;ummer and winter. Its influence upon the animal &s;pirits &s;trongly demon|&s;trates its connection with animal life, and hence we find a cheerful and a depre&s;&s;ed &s;tate of mind in many people, and more e&s;pecially in invalids, to be intimately connected with the pre&s;ence or ab&s;ence of the rays of the &s;un. The well known pede&s;trian traveller Mr. Stewart in one of his vi&s;its to this city informed me, that he had &s;pent a &s;ummer in Lap|land in the latitude of 69&deg; during the greate&s;t part of which time the &s;un was &s;eldom out of fight. He enjoyed he &s;aid during this period, uncommon health and &s;pirits, both of which he a&s;cribed to the long duration, and invigorating influence of light. The&s;e facts will &s;urpri&s;e us le&s;s when we attend to the ef|fects
<PB N="10" REF="036255_0016_100865F4265C1D38">
of light upon vegetables. Some of them lo&s;e their colour by being deprived of it; many of them di&s;cover a partiality to it in the direction of their flowers; and all of them di&s;charge their pure air only while they are expo&s;ed to it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Organization, &s;en&s;ation, &s;pontaneous motion and life, exi&s;t only at the &s;urface of the earth, and in places expo&s;ed to <HI>light.</HI> We might affirm the flame of Prometheus's torch was the expre&s;&s;ion of a philo&s;ophical truth that did not e&s;cape the ancients. Without light, nature was lifele&s;s, inanimate and dead. A benevolent God by producing life has &s;pread or|ganization, &s;en&s;ation and thought over the &s;urface of the earth." Lavoi&s;&s;ier.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. Sound has an exten&s;ive influence upon human life. Its numerous artificial and natural &s;ources need not be mentioned. I &s;hall only take notice, that the currents of winds, the pa&s;&s;age of in&s;ects through the air, and even the growth of vegeta|bles, are all attended with an emi&s;&s;ion of &s;ound; and although they become imperceptible from ha|bit; yet there is rea&s;on to believe they all act upon the body, through the medium of the ears. The exi&s;tence of the&s;e &s;ounds, is e&s;tabli&s;hed by the re|ports of per&s;ons who have a&s;cended two or three miles from the earth in a Balloon. They tell us that the &s;ilence which prevails in tho&s;e regions of
<PB N="11" REF="036255_0017_100865F74AD479E8">
the air is &s;o new and complete, as to produce an awful &s;olemnity in their minds. It is not nece&s;&s;ary that the&s;e &s;ounds &s;hould excite &s;en&s;ation, or percep|tion in order to their exerting a degree of &s;timulus upon the body. There are a hundred impre&s;&s;i|ons daily made upon it, which from habit, are not followed by &s;en&s;ation. The &s;timulus of ali|ment upon the &s;tomach, and of blood upon the heart and arteries, probably cea&s;e to be felt, only from the influence of habit. The exerci&s;e of walking, which was originally the re&s;ult of a deli|berate act of the will, is performed from habit without the lea&s;t degree of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s. It is un|fortunate for this, and many other parts of phy&s;io|logy, that we forget what pa&s;&s;ed in our minds the fir&s;t two or three years of our lives. Could we recollect the manner in which we acquired our fir&s;t ideas, and the progre&s;s of our knowledge with the evolution of our &s;en&s;es, and faculties; it would relieve us from many difficulties, and controver&s;ies upon this &s;ubject. Perhaps this forgetfulne&s;s by children, of the origin and progre&s;s of their know|ledge, might be remedied by our attending more clo&s;ely to the fir&s;t effects of impre&s;&s;ions, &s;en&s;ation, and perception upon them as di&s;covered by their little actions; all of which probably have a mean|ing, as determined as any of the actions of men or women.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="036255_0018_100865F99AC5A728">
The influence of &s;ounds of a certain kind in pro|ducing excitement, and thereby increa&s;ing life, can|not be denied. Fear produces debility which is a tendency to death.&mdash;Sound obviates this de|bility, and thus re&s;tores the &s;y&s;tem to the natural, and healthy grade of life. The &s;chool boy and the clown, invigorate their feeble and trembling limbs, by whi&s;tling or &s;inging as they pa&s;s by a coun|try church yard, and the &s;oldier feels his departing life recalled in the on&s;et of a battle by the noi&s;e of the fife, and of the poet's "&s;pirit &s;tirring drum." Intoxication is frequently attended with a higher degree of life than is natural. Now &s;ound we know will produce this with a very moderate portion of fermented liquor; hence we find men are more ea&s;ily and highly excited by it at public entertain|ments where there is mu&s;ic, loud talking, and hallooing, than in private companies where there is no auxiliary &s;timulus added to that of the wine. I wi&s;h the&s;e effects of &s;ound upon animal life to be remembered; for I &s;hall mention it hereafter as a remedy for the weak &s;tate of life in many di&s;ea&s;es, and &s;hall relate an in&s;tance in which a &s;cream &s;ud|denly extorted by grief, proved the means of re|&s;u&s;citating a per&s;on, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to be dead, and who had exhibited the u&s;ual recent marks of the extinction of life.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="036255_0019_100865FB1EF8C5A0">
I &s;hall conclude this head by remarking that per&s;ons, who are de&s;titute of hearing and &s;eeing, po&s;&s;e&s;s life in a more languid &s;tate than other peo|ple; and hence ari&s;e the dulne&s;s, and want of &s;pi|rits which they di&s;cover in their intercour&s;e with the world.</P>
<P N="3">3. Odors have a &s;en&s;ible effect in promoting animal life. The greater healthine&s;s of the coun|try, than cities, is derived in part from the efflu|via of odoriferous plants which float in the atmo&s;|phere in the &s;pring and &s;ummer months, acting upon the &s;y&s;tem, through the medium of the &s;en&s;e of &s;melling. The effects of odors, upon animal life, appear &s;till more obvious in the &s;udden revival of it, which they produce in ca&s;es of fainting. Here the &s;mell of a few drops of hart&s;horn, or even of a burnt feather, has frequently in a few minutes re&s;tored the &s;y&s;tem, from a &s;tate of weakne&s;s bor|dering upon death, to an equable and regular de|gree of excitement.</P>
<P N="4">4. Air acts as a powerful &s;timulus upon the &s;y|&s;tem through the medium of the lungs. The com|ponent parts of this fluid, and its decompo&s;ition in the lungs, will be con&s;idered in another place. I &s;hall only remark here, that the circulation of the
<PB N="14" REF="036255_0020_100865FD66438458">
blood has been a&s;cribed by Dr. Goodwin exclu&s;ively to the action of air upon the lungs and heart. Does the external air act upon any other part of the body be&s;ides tho&s;e which have been mentioned? It is probable it does, and that we lo&s;e our &s;en&s;ati|on and con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of it, by habit. It is certain children cry, for the mo&s;t part, as &s;oon as they come into the world. May not this be the effect of the &s;udden impre&s;&s;ion of air upon the tender &s;urface of their bodies? And may not the red color of their &s;kins, be occa&s;ioned by an irritation excited on them by the &s;timulus of the air? It is certain it acts powerfully upon dinudated animal fibres; for who has not ob&s;erved a &s;ore, and even the &s;kin when deprived of its cuticle, to be affected, when long expo&s;ed to the air, with pain, and inflammation?&mdash;The &s;timulus of air, in promoting the natural ac|tions of the alimentary canal, cannot be doubted. A certain portion of it &s;eems to be nece&s;&s;arily pre|&s;ent in the bowels in a healthy &s;tate.</P>
<P N="5">5. Heat is an uniform and active &s;timulus in pro|moting life. It is derived, in certain &s;ea&s;ons and countries, in part from the &s;un; but its principal &s;ource is from the lungs, in which it appears to be generated by the decompo&s;ition of pure air, and from whence it is conveyed by means of the circu|lation, to every part of the body. The exten&s;ive
<PB N="15" REF="036255_0021_10086600E0EB7998">
influence of heat upon animal life, is evident from its decay and &s;u&s;pen&s;ion during the winter in cer|tain animals, and from its revival upon the ap|proach and action of the vernal &s;un. It is true, life is dimini&s;hed much le&s;s in man, from the di&s;|tance and ab&s;ence of the &s;un, than in other ani|mals; but this mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing rea&s;on in &s;o high a degree, as to enable him to &s;up|ply the ab&s;traction of heat, by the action of other &s;timuli upon his &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P N="6">6. Exerci&s;e acts as a &s;timulus upon the body in various ways. Its fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion is upon the mu&s;|cles. The&s;e act upon the blood ve&s;&s;els, and they upon the nerves and brain. The nece&s;&s;ity of ex|erci&s;e to animal life is indicated, by its being kindly impo&s;ed upon man in paradi&s;e. The change which the human body underwent by the fall, rendered the &s;ame &s;alutary &s;timulus nece&s;&s;ary to its life, in the more active form of labor. But we are not to &s;uppo&s;e, that motion is excited in the body by exer|ci&s;e or labor alone. It is con&s;tantly &s;timulated by the po&s;itions of &s;tanding, &s;itting, and lying upon the &s;ides; all of which act more or le&s;s upon mu&s;|cular fibres, and by their means, upon every part of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>

7. The plea&s;ures we derive from our &s;en&s;es have a powerful and exten&s;ive influence upon human life. The number of the&s;e plea&s;ures, and their proxi|mate cau&s;e, will form an agreeable &s;ubject for two or three future lectures.</P>
<P>We proceed next to con&s;ider the internal &s;timuli which produce animal life. The&s;e are</P>
<P>I. FOOD. This acts in the following ways. 1. Upon the tongue. Such are the &s;en&s;ibility and ex|citability of this organ, and &s;o intimate, is its con|nection with every other part of the body; that the whole &s;y&s;tem is invigorated by aliment, as &s;oon as it comes in contact with it. 2. By ma&s;tication. This moves a number of mu&s;cles and blood ve&s;&s;els &s;ituated near the brain and heart, and of cour&s;e imparts impre&s;&s;ions to them. 3. By deglutition, which acts upon &s;imilar parts, and with the &s;ame effect. 4. By its pre&s;ence in the &s;tomach, in which it acts by its quantity and quality. Food, by di&s;|tending the &s;tomach, &s;timulates the contiguous parts of the body. A moderate degree of di&s;tention of the &s;tomach and bowels is e&s;&s;ential to a healthy ex|citement of the &s;y&s;tem. Vegetable aliment, and drinks, which contain le&s;s nouri&s;hment than animal food, &s;erve this purpo&s;e in the human body. Hay acts in the &s;ame manner in a hor&s;e. Sixteen
<PB N="17" REF="036255_0023_10086604AEAAF1F8">
pounds, of this light food, are nece&s;&s;ary to keep up &s;uch a degree of di&s;tention in the &s;tomach and bowels of this animal, as to impart to him his natu|ral grade of &s;trength and life. The <HI>quality</HI> of food, when of a &s;timulating nature, &s;upplies the place of di&s;tention from its quantity. A &s;ingle onion will &s;upport a lounging Highlander on the hills of Scotland for four and twenty hours. A moderate quantity of &s;alted meat, or a few ounces of &s;ugar, have &s;upplied the place of pounds of le&s;s &s;timulat|ing food. Even indige&s;tible &s;ub&s;tances, which re|main for days, or perhaps weeks in the &s;tomach, exert a &s;timulus there, which has an influence upon animal life. It is in this way the tops of briars, and the twigs of trees, devoid not only of nouri&s;h|ing matter, but of juices, &s;upport the camel in his journeys through the de&s;erts of the Ea&s;tern coun|tries. Chips of cedar po&s;ts, moi&s;tened with wa|ter, have &s;upported hor&s;es for two or three weeks, during a long voyage from Bo&s;ton to Surinam; and the indige&s;tible cover of an old Bible, pre|&s;erved the life of a dog, accidentally confined in a room at New Ca&s;tle upon Tyne, for twenty days. 5. Food &s;timulates the whole body by means of the proce&s;s of dige&s;tion which goes forward in the &s;tomach. This animal function is carried on in part by fermentation, in which there is an extrica|tion
<PB N="18" REF="036255_0024_1008660700E35B20">
of heat, and air. Now both the&s;e, it has been remarked, exert a &s;timulus in promoting animal life.</P>
<P>Drinks when they con&s;i&s;t of fermented or di&s;till|ed liquors, &s;timulate from their quality; but when they con&s;i&s;t of water, either in its &s;imple &s;tate, or impregnated with any &s;apid &s;ub&s;tance, they act principally by di&s;tention.</P>
<P>II. The chyle acts upon the lacteals, me&s;enteric glands, and thoracic duct, in its pa&s;&s;age through them; and it is highly probable, its fir&s;t mixture with the blood in the &s;ubclavian vein, and its fir&s;t action on the heart, are attended with con&s;iderable &s;timulating effects.</P>
<P>III. The blood is a very important internal &s;ti|mulus. It has been di&s;puted whether it acts by its quality, or only by di&s;tending the blood ve&s;&s;els. It appears to act in both ways. I believe with Dr. Whytt, that the blood &s;timulates the heart and arteries by a &s;pecific action. But if this be not ad|mitted, its influence in di&s;tending the blood ve&s;&s;els in every part of the body, and thereby imparting exten&s;ive and uniform impre&s;&s;ions to every animal fibre, cannot be denied.&mdash;In &s;upport of this a&s;&s;er|tion it has been remarked, that in tho&s;e per&s;ons
<PB N="19" REF="036255_0025_1008660A5FBD6978">
who die of hunger, there is no diminution of the quantity of blood in the large blood ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>IV. A certain TENSION of the glands, and of other parts of the body, contributes to &s;upport ani|mal life. This is evident in the vigor which is im|parted to the &s;y&s;tem, by the fulne&s;s of the &s;eminal ve&s;icles and gall bladder&punc; and by the di&s;tention of the uterus in pregnancy. This di&s;tention is &s;o great, in &s;ome in&s;tances, as to prevent &s;leep for ma|ny days and even weeks before delivery. It &s;erves the valuable purpo&s;e of rendering the female &s;y&s;tem le&s;s liable to death during its continuance, than at any other time. By increa&s;ing the quantity of life in the body, it often &s;u&s;pends the fatal i&s;&s;ue of pul|monary con&s;umption, and en&s;ures a temporary victory over the plague and other malignant fevers; for death, from tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, &s;eldom takes place until the &s;timulus, from the di&s;tention of the uterus, is removed by parturition.</P>
<P>V. The exerci&s;es of the faculties of the mind have a wonderful influence in increa&s;ing the quan|tity of human life. They all act by <HI>reflection</HI> on|ly, after having been previou&s;ly excited into acti|on by impre&s;&s;ions made upon the body. This view, of the <HI>reaction</HI> of the mind upon the body, accords with the &s;implicity of other operations in
<PB N="20" REF="036255_0026_1008660CA75D3D70">
the animal oeconomy. It is thus the brain re|pays the heart for the blood it conveys to it, by reacting upon its mu&s;cular fibres.&mdash;The influence of the different faculties of the mind is felt in the pul&s;e, in the &s;tomach, and in the liver, and is &s;een in the face, and other external parts of the body. Tho&s;e which act mo&s;t unequivocally in pro|moting life, are the under&s;tanding, the imagination, and the pa&s;&s;ions. Thinking belongs to the under|&s;tanding, and is attended with an obvious influ|ence upon the degree and duration of life. In|ten&s;e &s;tudy has often rendered the body in&s;en&s;ible to the debilitating effects of cold, and hunger. Men of great and active under&s;tandings, who blend with their &s;tudies, temperance and exerci&s;e, are generally long lived. In &s;upport of this a&s;&s;ertion, a hundred names might be added to tho&s;e of Newton and Franklin. Its truth will be more ful|ly e&s;tabli&s;hed by attending to the &s;tate of human life in per&s;ons of an oppo&s;ite intellectual character. The Cretins, a race of idiots in Valais in Swi&s;&s;er|land, travellers tell us, are all &s;hort lived. Com|mon language ju&s;tifies the opinion of the &s;timulus of the under&s;tanding upon the brain, hence it is common to &s;ay of dull men, that they have &s;carce|ly ideas enough to keep them&s;elves awake.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="036255_0027_1008660E29EE6000">
The imagination acts with great force upon the body, whether its numerous a&s;&s;ociations produce plea&s;ure or pain. But the pa&s;&s;ions pour a con&s;tant &s;tream upon the wheels of life. They have been &s;ubdivided into emotions and pa&s;&s;ions properly &s;o called. The former have for their objects pre&s;ent, the latter, future good and evil. All the objects of the pa&s;&s;ions are accompanied with de&s;ire or aver&s;ion. To the former belong chiefly, hope, love, ambition, and avarice; to the latter&mdash;fear, hatred, malice, envy, and the like. Joy, anger, and terror, belong to the cla&s;s of emotions. The pa&s;&s;ions and emotions have been further divided into &s;timulating and &s;edative. Our bu&s;ine&s;s at pre|&s;ent is to con&s;ider their fir&s;t effect only upon the body. In the original con&s;titution of human nature, we were made to be &s;timulated by &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions and emotions only as have moral good for their objects. Man was de&s;igned to be always under the influence of hope, love, and joy. By the lo&s;s of his inno|cence, he has &s;ubjected him&s;elf to the dominion of pa&s;&s;ions and emotions of a malignant nature; but they po&s;&s;e&s;s, in common with &s;uch as are good, a &s;timulus which renders them &s;ub&s;ervient to the purpo&s;e of promoting animal life. It is true, they are like the &s;timulus of a di&s;located bone in their operation upon the body, compared with the action of antagoni&s;t mu&s;cles &s;tretched over bones, which
<PB N="22" REF="036255_0028_10086610749A85B0">
gently move in their natural &s;ockets. The effects of the good pa&s;&s;ions and emotions, in promoting health and longevity, have been taken notice of by many writers. They produce a flame, gentle and plea&s;ant, like oil perfumed with frankincen&s;e in the lamp of life. There are in&s;tances likewi&s;e of per&s;ons who have derived &s;trength, and long life from the influence of the evil pa&s;&s;ions and emotions that have been mentioned. Dr. Darwin relates the hi&s;tory of a man, who u&s;ed to overcome the fatigue induced by travelling, by thinking of a per&s;on whom he hated. The debility induced by di&s;ea&s;e, is often removed by a &s;udden change in the temper. This is &s;o common, that even nur&s;e; predict a recovery in per&s;ons as &s;oon as they be|come peevi&s;h and ill-natured, after having been patient during the wor&s;t &s;tage of their &s;ickne&s;s. This peevi&s;hne&s;s acts as a gentle &s;timulus upon the &s;y&s;tem in its languid &s;tate, and thus turns the &s;cale in favour of life and health. The famous Benja|min Lay of this &s;tate, who lived to be eighty years of age, was of a very ira&s;cible temper. Old Elwes was a prodigy of avarice, and every court in Eu|rope furni&s;hes in&s;tances of men who have attained to extreme old age, who have lived con&s;tantly un|der the dominion of ambition. In the cour&s;e of a long inquiry, which I in&s;tituted &s;ome years ago into the &s;tate of the body and mind in old people, I did
<PB N="23" REF="036255_0029_10086613E34F7978">
not find a &s;ingle per&s;on above eighty, who had not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an active under&s;tanding, or active pa&s;|&s;ions. Tho&s;e different and oppo&s;ite faculties of the mind, when in exce&s;s, happily &s;upply the place of each other. Where they unite their forces, they extingui&s;h the flame of life, before the oil which feeds it is con&s;umed.</P>
<P>In another place I &s;hall re&s;ume the influence of the faculties of the mind upon human life, as they di&s;cover them&s;elves in the different pur&s;uits of men.</P>
<P>I have only to add here, that I &s;ee no occa&s;ion to admit, with the followers of Dr. Brown, that the mind is active in &s;leep, in pre&s;erving the mo|tions of life. I hope to e&s;tabli&s;h hereafter the opinion of Mr. Locke, that the mind is always pa&s;|&s;ive in &s;ound &s;leep. It is true it acts in dreams; but the&s;e depend upon a morbid &s;tate of the brain, and therefore do not belong to the pre&s;ent &s;tage of our &s;ubject; for I am now con&s;idering animal life only in the healthy &s;tate of the body. I &s;hall &s;ay pre&s;ently, that dreams are intended to &s;upply the ab&s;ence of &s;ome natural &s;timulus, and hence we find they occur in tho&s;e per&s;ons mo&s;t commonly, in whom there is a want of healthy action in the
<PB N="24" REF="036255_0030_10086615689D7218">
&s;y&s;tem induced by the exce&s;s, or deficiency of cu&s;|tomary &s;timuli.</P>
<P>Life is in a languid &s;tate, in the morning. It acquires vigor by the gradual, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ap|plication of &s;timuli in the forenoon. It is in its mo&s;t perfect &s;tate about midday, and remains &s;tationary for &s;ome hours. From the diminution of the &s;en&s;ibility and contractility of the &s;y&s;tem to the action of impre&s;&s;ions, it le&s;&s;ens in the evening, and becomes again languid at bedtime. The&s;e facts will admit of an exten&s;ive application here|after in our lectures upon the practice of phy&s;ic.</P>

<P>The &s;timuli which have been enumerated, when they act collectively, and within certain bounds, produce a healthy waking &s;tate. But they do not always act collectively, nor in the determined and regular manner that has been de&s;cribed. There is in many &s;tates of the &s;y&s;tem, a deficiency of &s;ome &s;timuli, and in &s;ome of its &s;tates, an apparent ab&s;ence of them all. To account for the continu|ance
<PB N="25" REF="036255_0031_10086617B6E86198">
of animal life under &s;uch circum&s;tances, two things mu&s;t be premi&s;ed, before we proceed to take notice of the diminution, or ab&s;ence of the &s;timuli which &s;upport it.</P>
<P N="1">1. The healthy actions of the body in the wak|ing &s;tate, con&s;i&s;t in a proper degree of what has been called excitability, and excitement. The former is the medium on which &s;timuli act in pro|ducing the latter. In an exact proportion, and a due relation of both, diffu&s;ed uniformly through|out every part of the body, con&s;i&s;ts good health. Di&s;ea&s;e is the rever&s;e of this. It depends <HI>in part</HI> upon a di&s;proportion between excitement and ex|citability, and in a partial di&s;tribution of each of them. In thus di&s;tingui&s;hing the different &s;tates of excitement and excitability in health and &s;ickne&s;s, you &s;ee I di&s;&s;ent from Dr. Brown, who &s;uppo&s;es them to be uniform and equable, in the morbid, as well as the healthy &s;tates of the body.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is a law of the &s;y&s;tem, that the ab&s;ence of one natural &s;timulus is generally &s;upplied by the increa&s;ed action of others. This is more certainly the ca&s;e, where a natural &s;timulus is ab&s;tracted <HI>&s;uddenly;</HI> for the excitability is thereby &s;o in&s;tantly formed and accumulated, as to furni&s;h a highly &s;en|&s;ible and moveable &s;urface for the remaining &s;timu|li
<PB N="26" REF="036255_0032_1008661ACD1B06B8">
to act upon. Many proofs might be adduced in &s;upport of this propo&s;ition. The reduction of the excitement of the blood ve&s;&s;els, by means of cold, prepares the way for a full meal, or a warm bed, to excite in them the morbid actions which take place in a pleuri&s;y or a rheumati&s;m. A hor&s;e in a cold &s;table eats more than in a warm one; and thus counteracts the debility which would other|wi&s;e be induced upon his &s;y&s;tem, by the ab&s;traction of the &s;timulus of warm air.</P>
<P>The&s;e two propo&s;itions being admitted, I pro|ceed next to inquire into the different degrees and &s;tates of animal life. The fir&s;t departure from its ordinary and perfect &s;tate, which &s;trikes us, is in</P>
<P>I. Sleep: This is either natural or artificial. Natural &s;leep is induced by a diminution of the ex|citement, and excitability of the &s;y&s;tem by the con|tinued application of the &s;timuli which act upon the body in its waking &s;tate. When the&s;e &s;timuli act in a determined degree, that is, when the &s;ame number of &s;timuli act with the &s;ame force, and for the &s;ame time, upon the &s;y&s;tem; &s;leep will be brought on at the &s;ame hour every night. But when they act with uncommon force, or for an unu&s;ual time, it is brought on at an earlier hour.
<PB N="27" REF="036255_0033_1008661C5011E828">
Thus a long walk, or ride by per&s;ons accu&s;tom|ed to a &s;edentary life, unu&s;ual exerci&s;e of the under&s;tanding, the action of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, or emotions, and the continual application of unu&s;ual &s;ounds &s;eldom fail of inducing premature &s;leep. It is recorded of Pope Ganganelli, that he &s;lept more &s;oundly, and longer than u&s;ual, the night after he was rai&s;ed to the papal chair. The effects of unu&s;ual &s;ounds in bringing on pre|mature &s;leep, is further demon&s;trated by that con|&s;tant inclination to retire to bed at an early hour, which country people di&s;cover the fir&s;t and &s;econd days they &s;pend in a city, expo&s;ed from morning till night to the noi&s;e of hammers, files and looms, or of days, carts, waggons, and coaches rattling over pavements of &s;tone.&mdash;Sleep is further ha&s;t|ened by the ab&s;ence of light, the ce&s;&s;ation of &s;ounds, and labor, and the recumbent po&s;ture of the body on a &s;oft bed.</P>
<P>Artificial &s;leep may be induced at any time by certain &s;timulating &s;ub&s;tances, particularly by opi|um. They act by carrying the &s;y&s;tem beyond the healthy grade of excitement, to a degree of indi|rect debility which Dr. Brown has happily called the &s;leeping point. The &s;ame point may be induc|ed in the &s;y&s;tem at any time by the artificial ab|&s;traction
<PB N="28" REF="036255_0034_1008661F69603190">
of the u&s;ual &s;timuli of life. For example. Let a per&s;on &s;hut him&s;elf up at mid-day in a dark room, remote from noi&s;e of all kinds, let him lie down on his back upon a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span"> in a temperate &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere, and let him cea&s;e to think upon intere&s;ting &s;ubjects, or let him think only upon one &s;ubject, and he will &s;oon fall a&s;leep. Dr. Boerhaave relates an in&s;tance of a Dutch phy|&s;ician who having per&s;uaded him&s;elf that waking was a violent &s;tate, and &s;leep the only natural one of the &s;y&s;tem; contrived by ab&s;tracting every kind of &s;timulus in the manner that has been mentioned, to &s;leep away whole days and nights, until at length he impaired his under&s;tanding, and final|ly peri&s;hed in a public ho&s;pital in a &s;tate of idiot|i&s;m.</P>
<P>In thus anticipating a view of the cau&s;e of &s;leep, I have &s;aid nothing of the effects of di&s;ea&s;es of the brain in inducing it. The&s;e belong to another part of our cour&s;e. The &s;hort explanation I have given of its cau&s;e, was nece&s;&s;ary in order to ren|der the hi&s;tory of animal life, in that &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem, more intelligible.</P>
<P>At the u&s;ual hour of &s;leep there is an ab&s;traction of the &s;timuli of light, &s;ound and mu&s;cular motion.
<PB N="29" REF="036255_0035_10086620ECA323A8">
The &s;timuli which remain, and act with an increa&s;|ed force upon the body in &s;leep are,</P>
<P N="1">1. The heat which is di&s;charged from the body, and confined by means of bed clothes. It is mo&s;t perceptible when exhaled from a bed fellow. Heat obtained in this way, has &s;ometimes been employed to re&s;tore declining life to the bodies of old people. Witne&s;s the dam&s;el who lay for this purpo&s;e in the bo&s;om of the king of I&s;rael. The advantage of this external heat will appear further, when we con&s;ider how impracticable, or imperfect &s;leep is, when we lie under too light covering in cold weather.</P>
<P N="2">2. The air which is applied to the lungs during &s;leep probably acts with more force than in the waking &s;tate. I am di&s;po&s;ed to believe that more air is phlogi&s;ticated in &s;leep than at any other time, for the &s;mell of a clo&s;e room in which a per&s;on has &s;lept one night, we know, is much more di&s;agree|able than that of a room under equal circum&s;tances, in which half a dozen people have &s;at for the &s;ame number of hours in the day time.&mdash;The action of decompo&s;ed air on the lungs and heart was &s;poken of in a former lecture. An increa&s;e in its quantity mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have a powerful influence upon animal life during the &s;leeping &s;tate.</P>

Re&s;piration is performed with a greater ex|ten&s;ion, and contraction of the mu&s;cles of the brea&s;t in &s;leep than in the waking &s;tate; and this cannot fail of increa&s;ing the impetus of the blood in its pa&s;&s;age through the heart and blood ve&s;&s;els. The increa&s;e of the fulne&s;s and force of the pul&s;e in &s;leep, is probably owing in part to the action of re&s;piration upon it. In another place I hope to elevate the rank of the blood ve&s;&s;els in the animal oeconomy, by &s;hewing that they are the fountains of power in the body. They derive this preemi|nence from the protection and &s;upport they afford to every part of the &s;y&s;tem. They are the perpe|tual centinels of health and life; for they never partake in the repo&s;e which is enjoyed by the mu&s;|cles and nerves. During &s;leep, their &s;en&s;ibility &s;eems to be converted into contractility, by which means their mu&s;cular fibres are more ea&s;ily moved by the blood, than in the waking &s;tate. The di|minution of &s;en&s;ibility in &s;leep is proved by many facts to be mentioned hereafter; and the change of &s;en&s;ibility into contractility will appear, when we come to con&s;ider the &s;tate of animal life in infancy and old age.</P>
<P N="4">4. Aliment in the &s;tomach acts more powerfully in &s;leep, than in the waking &s;tate. This is evident from dige&s;tion going on more rapidly when we are
<PB N="31" REF="036255_0037_10086626B1D06D18">
awake than when we &s;leep.&mdash;The more &s;low the dige&s;tion, the greater is the &s;timulus of the aliment in the &s;tomach. Of this we have many proofs in daily life. Labourers object to milk as a breakfa&s;t; becau&s;e it dige&s;ts too &s;oon, and often call for food in a morning, which they can feel all day in their &s;tomachs. Sau&s;&s;ages, fat pork, and onions are generally preferred by them for this purpo&s;e. A moderate &s;upper is favourable to ea&s;y and &s;ound &s;leep; and the want of it in per&s;ons who are accu&s;tomed to that meal, is often followed by a re&s;tle&s;s night. The ab&s;ence of its &s;timulus is probably &s;upplied by a full gall bladder (which al|ways attends an empty &s;tomach) in per&s;ons who are not in the habit of eating &s;uppers.</P>
<P N="5">5. The &s;timulus of the urine, accumulated in the bladder during &s;leep, has a perceptible influence upon animal life. It is often &s;o con&s;iderable as to interrupt &s;leep; and it is one of the cau&s;es of our waking at a regular hour in the morning. It is moreover a frequent cau&s;e of the activity of the under&s;tanding and pa&s;&s;ions in dreams; and hence we dream more in our morning &s;lumbers when the bladder is full, than we do in the beginning, or middle of the night.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="32" REF="036255_0038_10086628F22FFDF0">
6. The faeces exert a con&s;tant &s;timulus upon the bowels in &s;leep. This is &s;o con&s;iderable as to ren|der it le&s;s profound, when they have been accu|mulated for two or three days, or when they have been depo&s;ited in the extremity of the alimentary canal.</P>
<P N="7">7. The partial and irregular exerci&s;es of the under&s;tanding and pa&s;&s;ions in dreams have an oc|ca&s;ional influence in promoting life. They occur only where there is a deficiency of other &s;timuli. Such is the force with which the mind acts upon the body in dreams, that Dr. Brambilla, phy&s;ician to the emperor of Germany, informs us, that he has &s;een in&s;tances of wounds in &s;oldiers being in|flamed, and putting on a gangrenous appearance in con&s;equence of the commotions excited in their bodies by irritating dreams. The &s;timulating pa&s;|&s;ions act through the medium of the will; and the exerci&s;es of this faculty of the mind &s;ometimes extend &s;o far as to produce actions in the mu&s;cles of the limbs, and occa&s;ionally in the whole body, as we &s;ee in per&s;ons who walk in their &s;leep. The &s;timulus of lo&s;t often awakens us with plea|&s;ure or pain, according as we are di&s;po&s;ed to re|&s;pect, or di&s;obey the precepts of our Maker. The angry and revengeful pa&s;&s;ions often deliver us in like manner, from the imaginary guilt of murder.
<PB N="33" REF="036255_0039_1008662A7B745640">
Even the debilitating pa&s;&s;ions of grief, and fear, produce an indirect operation upon the &s;y&s;tem that is favourable to life in &s;leep, for they excite that di&s;tre&s;&s;ing di&s;ea&s;e called the night mare, which prompts us to &s;peak, or halloo, and by thus in|vigorating re&s;piration, re&s;tores the languid circula|tion of the blood in the heart and brain. Do not complain then, gentlemen, when you are be&s;trode by this midnight hag. She is kindly &s;ent to pre|vent your &s;udden death. Per&s;ons who go to bed in good health, and are found dead the &s;ucceeding morning, are &s;aid mo&s;t commonly to die of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>I cannot di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject of the &s;timulating effects of dreams, without taking notice of an opi|nion of Dr. Darwin which is connected with it. He &s;uppo&s;es dreams are never attended with vo|lition. The facts which have been mentioned, prove, that the will frequently acts with <HI>more</HI> force in them, than in the waking &s;tate.</P>
<P>I proceed now to inquire into the &s;tate of animal life in its different &s;tages. I pa&s;s over for the pre|&s;ent its hi&s;tory in generation. It will be &s;ufficient only to remark in this place, that its fir&s;t motion is produced by the &s;timulus of the male &s;eed upon the female ovum. This opinion is not originally mine.
<PB N="34" REF="036255_0040_10086632210BCEF0">
You will find it in Dr. Haller.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Novum foetum a &s;eminis ma&s;culi <HI>&s;timulo</HI> vitam con|cepi&s;&s;e." Elementa Phy&s;iologiae, vol. viii. p. 177.</NOTE> The pungent ta&s;te which Mr. John Hunter di&s;covered in the male &s;eed, renders it peculiarly fit for this purpo&s;e. No &s;ooner is the female ovum thus &s;et in motion, and the foetus formed, than its capacity of life is &s;up|ported,</P>
<P N="1">1. By the &s;timulus of the heat which it derives from its connection with its mother in the womb.</P>
<P N="2">2. By the &s;timulus of its own circulating blood.</P>
<P N="3">3. By its con&s;tant motion in the womb after the third month of pregnancy. The ab&s;ence of this motion for a few days, is always a &s;ign of the indi&s;|po&s;ition or death of a foetus. Con&s;idering how ear|ly a child is accu&s;tomed to it, it is &s;trange that a cradle &s;hould 'ever have been denied to it after it comes into the world.</P>
<P>II. In infants there is an ab&s;ence of many of the &s;timuli which &s;upport life.&mdash;Their excretions are in a great mea&s;ure deficient in acrimony, and their mental faculties are too weak to exert much influ|ence
<PB N="35" REF="036255_0041_1008663F9176B400">
upon their bodies. But the ab&s;ence of &s;timu|lus from tho&s;e cau&s;es, is amply &s;upplied</P>
<P N="1">1. By the very great excitability of their &s;y&s;|tems to tho&s;e of light, &s;ound, heat, and air. So powerfully do light and &s;ound act upon them, that the author of nature has kindly defended their eyes and ears from an exce&s;s of their impre&s;&s;ions by imperfect vi&s;ion, and hearing, for &s;everal weeks after birth. The capacity of infants to be acted upon by moderate degrees of heat is evident from their &s;uffering le&s;s from cold than grown people. This is &s;o much the ca&s;e, that we read in Mr. Umfreville's account of Hud&s;on's Bay, of a child that was found alive upon the back of its mother after &s;he was frozen to death. I before hinted at the action of the air upon the bodies of new born infants in producing the red color of their &s;kins. It is highly probable, (from a fact former|ly mentioned) that the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion of the at|mo&s;phere which produces this redne&s;s is accom|panied with pain, and this we know is a &s;timulus of a very active nature. By a kind law of &s;en&s;ation, impre&s;&s;ions, that were originally painful, become plea&s;urable by repetition, or duration. This is re|markably evident in the impre&s;&s;ion now under con|&s;ideration, and hence we find infants at a certain age, di&s;cover &s;igns of an increa&s;e of life by their
<PB N="36" REF="036255_0042_1008662CC6DE9F08">
delightful ge&s;tures, when they are carried into the open air. Recollect further gentlemen, what was &s;aid formerly, of excitability, predominating over &s;en&s;ibility in infants. We &s;ee it daily, not only in their patience of cold, but in the &s;hort time in which they cea&s;e to complain of the injuries they meet with from falls, cuts, and even &s;evere &s;urgi|cal operations.</P>
<P N="2">2. Animal life is &s;upported in infants by their &s;ucking, or feeding, nearly every hour in the day, and night when they are awake. I explained for|merly the manner in which food &s;timulated the &s;y&s;tem. The action of &s;ucking, &s;upplies by the mu&s;cles employed in it, the &s;timulus of ma&s;tication.</P>
<P N="3">3. Laughing and Crying, which are univer&s;al in infancy, have a con&s;iderable influence in promoting animal life, by their action upon re&s;piration, and the circulation of the blood. Laughing exi&s;ts under all circum&s;tances, independently of education or imitation. The child of a negro &s;lave born only to inherit the toils and mi&s;ery of its parents, re|ceives its ma&s;ter with a &s;mile every time he enters his kitchen, or a negro-quarter. But laughing ex|i&s;ts in infancy under circum&s;tances &s;till more unfa|vourable to it, an in&s;tance of which is related by Mr. Bruce. After a journey of &s;everal hundred
<PB N="37" REF="036255_0043_1008663465023288">
miles acro&s;s the &s;ands of Nubia, he came to a &s;pring of water &s;haded by a few &s;crubby trees. Here he intended to have re&s;ted during the night, but he had not &s;lept long, before he was awakened by a noi&s;e which he perceived was made by a &s;olitary Arab equally fatigued, and half fami&s;hed with him&s;elf, who was preparing to murder and plun|der him. Mr. Bruce ru&s;hed upon him, and made him his pri&s;oner. The next morning he was joined by a half &s;tarved female companion, with an infant of &s;ix months old in her arms. In pa&s;&s;ing by this child, Mr. Bruce &s;ays it laughed and crowed in his face, and attempted to leap upon him. From this fact it would &s;eem as if laughing was not only characteri&s;tic of our &s;pecies, but that it was early and intimately connected with human life. The child of the&s;e Arabs had probably ne|ver &s;een a &s;mile upon the faces of its ferocious parents, and perhaps had never, (before the &s;ight of Mr. Bruce), beheld any other human crea|ture.</P>
<P>Crying has a con&s;iderable influence upon health and life in children. I have &s;een &s;o many in&s;tances of its &s;alutary effects, that I have &s;atisfied my&s;elf that it is as po&s;&s;ible for a child to "cry and be fat," as it is to "laugh and be fat."</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="38" REF="036255_0044_1008663626A00FC0">
4. As children advance in life, the con&s;tancy of their appetites for food, and their di&s;po&s;ition to laugh, and cry, le&s;&s;en, but the diminution of the&s;e &s;timuli &s;upplied by exerci&s;e. The limbs, and tongues of children are always in motion. They continue likewi&s;e to eat oftener than adults. A cru&s;t of bread is commonly the la&s;t thing they a&s;k for at night, and the fir&s;t thing they call for in the morning. It is now they begin to feel the energy of their mental faculties. This &s;timulus is a&s;&s;i&s;ted in its force, by the di&s;po&s;ition to prattle which is &s;o univer&s;al among children. This habit of converting their ideas into words as fa&s;t as they ri&s;e, follows them to their beds, where we often hear them talk them&s;elves to &s;leep in a whi&s;per, or to u&s;e le&s;s correct, but more &s;triking terms, by <HI>thinking aloud.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Dreams act at an early period upon the bodies of children. Their &s;miles, &s;tartings, and occa&s;ion|al &s;creams in their &s;leep appear to ari&s;e from them. After the third or fourth year of their lives, they &s;ometimes confound them with things that are real. From ob&s;erving the effects of this mi&s;take upon the memory, a &s;en&s;ible woman whom I once knew, for|bad her children to tell their dreams, le&s;t they &s;hould contract habits of lying, by confounding imaginary, with real events.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="39" REF="036255_0045_10086638704A84B0">
6. New objects whether natural or artificial, are never &s;een by children without emotions of plea&s;ure which act upon their capacity of life. The effects of novelty upon the tender bodies of children may ea&s;ily be conceived, by its friendly influence upon the health of invalids who vi&s;it foreign countries, and who pa&s;s months, or years in a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of new and agreeable im|pre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>III. From the combination of all the &s;timuli that have been enumerated, human life is generally in exce&s;s from fifteen to thirty-five. It is during this period, the pa&s;&s;ions blow a perpetual &s;torm. The mo&s;t predominating of them is the love of plea&s;ure. No &s;ooner does the &s;y&s;tem become in&s;en&s;ible to this &s;timulus, than ambition &s;ucceeds it in,</P>
<P>IV. The middle &s;tage of life. Here we behold man in his mo&s;t perfect phy&s;ical &s;tate. The &s;timuli which now act upon him are &s;o far regulated by prudence, that they are &s;eldom exce&s;&s;ive in their force. The habits of order the &s;y&s;tem acquires in this period, continue to produce good health for many years afterwards, and hence bills of mortality prove that fewer per&s;ons die between forty and fifty-&s;even; than in any other &s;eventeen years of human life.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="036255_0046_1008663B79BD6AF8">
V. In OLD AGE the &s;en&s;es of &s;eeing, hearing and touch are impaired. The venereal appetite is weakened, or entirely extingui&s;hed. The pul&s;e becomes &s;low, and &s;ubject to frequent intermi&s;&s;ions, from a decay in the force of the blood ve&s;&s;els; Exerci&s;e becomes impracticable, or irk&s;ome, and the operations of the under&s;tanding are performed with languor and difficulty. In this &s;hattered and declining &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem, the ab&s;ence and diminution of all the &s;timuli which have been mentioned are &s;upplied,</P>
<P N="1">1. By an increa&s;e in the quantity, and by the pe|culiar quality of the food which is taken by old people. They generally eat twice as much as per|&s;ons in middle life, and they bear with pain the u&s;ual intervals between meals. They moreover prefer that kind of food which is &s;avoury and &s;timulating. The &s;tomach of the celebrated Parr, who died in the one hundred and fiftieth year of his age, was found full of &s;trong, nouri&s;hing ali|ment.</P>
<P N="2">2. By the &s;timulus of the faeces which are fre|quently retained for five or &s;ix days in the bowels of old people.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="41" REF="036255_0047_1008663D00DC69C8">
3. By the &s;timulus of fluids rendered preterna|turally acrid by age. The urine, &s;weat and even the tears of old people, po&s;&s;e&s;s a peculiar acrimo|ny. Their blood likewi&s;e lo&s;es part of the mild|ne&s;s which is natural to that fluid; and hence the difficulty with which &s;ores heal in old people; and hence too the rea&s;on why cancers are more com|mon in the decline, than in any other period of human life.</P>
<P N="4">4. By the uncommon activity of certain pa&s;&s;ions. The&s;e are either good or evil. To the former be|long an increa&s;ed vigor in the operations of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which have for their objects the Divine Being, or the whole family of mankind, or their own offspring, particularly their grand-children. To the latter pa&s;&s;ions belong, malice, a hatred of the manners and fa&s;hions of the ri&s;ing generation, and above all, avarice. This pa&s;&s;ion knows no holidays. Its &s;timulus is con&s;tant, though varied daily by the numerous means which it has di&s;cover|ed of increa&s;ing, &s;ecuring, and perpetuating pro|perty. It has been ob&s;erved that weak mental impre&s;&s;ions produce much greater effects in old people than in per&s;ons in middle life. A trifling indi&s;po&s;ition in a grand-child, an inadvertent act of unkindne&s;s from a friend, or the fear of lo&s;ing a few &s;hillings, have in many in&s;tances produced
<PB N="42" REF="036255_0048_1008662F0D038718">
in them a degree of wakefulne&s;s that has continued for two or three nights. It is to this highly exci|table &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem that Solomon probably al|ludes, when he de&s;cribes the gra&s;shopper as bur|den&s;ome to old people.</P>
<P N="5">5. By the pa&s;&s;ion for talking, which is &s;o com|mon, as to be one of the characteri&s;tics of old age. I mentioned formerly, the influence of this &s;timulus upon animal life. Perhaps it is more nece&s;&s;ary in the female con&s;titution than in the male; for it has long ago been remarked, that women who are ve|ry taciturn, are generally unhealthy.</P>
<P N="6">6. By their wearing warmer clothes, and prefer|ring warmer rooms, than in the former periods of their lives. This practice is &s;o uniform, that it would not be difficult in many ca&s;es to tell a man's age by his dre&s;s, or by finding out at what degree of heat he found him&s;elf comfortable in a clo&s;e room.</P>
<P N="7">7. By dreams. The&s;e are univer&s;al among old people. They ari&s;e from their &s;hort and imperfect &s;leep.</P>
<P N="8">8. It has been often &s;aid that "We are once men, and twice children." In &s;peaking of the &s;tate of
<PB N="43" REF="036255_0049_10086642F4F4BF58">
animal life in infancy, I remarked that the contrac|tility of the animal fibres, predominated over their &s;en&s;ibility in that &s;tage of life. The &s;ame thing takes place in old people, and it is in con&s;equence of the return of this infantile &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem, that all the &s;timuli which have been mentioned act upon them with much more force than in middle life. This &s;amene&s;s, in the predominance of excita|bility over &s;en&s;ibility in children and old people, will account for the &s;imilarity of their habits with re&s;pect to eating, &s;leep, exerci&s;e, and the u&s;e of fermented or di&s;tilled liquors. It is from the in|crea&s;e of excitability in old people, that &s;o &s;mall a quantity of &s;trong drink intoxicates them; and it is from an ignorance of this change in their con&s;titu|tions, that many of them become drunkards after pa&s;&s;ing the early and middle &s;tages of life with &s;ober characters.</P>
<P>Life is continued in a le&s;s imperfect &s;tate in old age, in women than in men. The former &s;ew, and knit, and &s;pin, after they lo&s;e the u&s;e of their ears and eyes; whereas the latter, after lo&s;ing the u&s;e of tho&s;e &s;en&s;es, frequently pa&s;s the evening of their lives in a torpid &s;tate in a chimney corner. It is from the influence of moderate and gently &s;ti|mulating employments, upon the female con&s;titu|tion, that more women live to be old, than men,
<PB N="44" REF="036255_0050_1008664544D1B420">
and that they rarely &s;urvive their u&s;efulne&s;s in dome&s;tic life.</P>
<P>Hitherto the principles I am endeavouring to e&s;tabli&s;h, have been applied to explain the cau&s;e of life in its more common forms. Let us next inquire, how far they will enable us to explain its continuance in certain morbid &s;tates of the body, in which there is a diminution of &s;ome, and an appa|rent ab&s;traction of all the &s;timuli, which have been &s;uppo&s;ed to produce animal life.</P>
<P>I. We ob&s;erve &s;ome people to be blind, or deaf and dumb from their birth. The &s;ame defects of &s;ight, hearing, and &s;peech, are &s;ometimes brought on by di&s;ea&s;es. Here animal life is de|prived of all tho&s;e numerous &s;timuli, which ari&s;e from light, colors, &s;ounds, and &s;peech. But the ab|&s;ence of the&s;e &s;timuli is &s;upplied,</P>
<P>I. By increa&s;ed &s;en&s;ibility and excitability in their remaining &s;en&s;es. The ears, the no&s;e, and the fingers, afford a &s;urface for impre&s;&s;ions in blind people which frequently overbalances the lo&s;s of their eye&s;ight. There are two blind young men, brothers, in this city, of the name of Dutton, who can tell when they approach a po&s;t in walking acro&s;s a &s;treet, by a peculiar &s;ound which the ground
<PB N="45" REF="036255_0051_10086646C81D83C0">
under their feet emits in the neighbourhood of the po&s;t. Their &s;en&s;e of hearing is &s;till more exqui&s;ite to &s;ounds of another kind. They can tell the names of a number of tame pidgeons, with which they amu&s;e them&s;elves in a little garden, by only hear|ing them fly over their heads. The celebrated blind philo&s;opher Dr. Moy&s;e can di&s;tingui&s;h a black dre&s;s on his friends, by its &s;mell; and we read of many in&s;tances of blind per&s;ons who have been able to perceive colors by rubbing their fingers up|on them. One of the&s;e per&s;ons mentioned by Mr. Boyle, has left upon record an account of the &s;peci|fic quality of each color as it affected his &s;en&s;e of touch. He &s;ays, black imparted the mo&s;t, and blue, the lea&s;t perceptible &s;en&s;e of a&s;perity to his fingers.</P>
<P N="2">2. By an increa&s;e of vigor in the exerci&s;e of the mental faculties. The poems of Homer, Mil|ton and Blacklock, and the attainments of Sander|&s;on in mathematical knowledge, all di&s;cover how much the energy of the mind is increa&s;ed by the ab&s;ence of impre&s;&s;ions upon the organs of vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>II. We &s;ometimes behold life in idiots in whom there is not only an ab&s;ence of the &s;timuli of the under&s;tanding and pa&s;&s;ions; but frequently from the weakne&s;s of their bodies, a deficiency of the loco|motive
<PB N="46" REF="036255_0052_100866496D5433C8">
powers. Here an inordinate appetite for food, or venereal plea&s;ures, or a con&s;tant habit of laughing, or talking, or playing with their hands and feet, &s;upply the place of the &s;timulating ope|rations of the mind, and of general bodily exerci&s;e. Of the inordinate force of the venereal appetite in idiots we have many proofs. The Cretins are much addicted to venery; and Dr. Michaelis tells us that the idiot whom he &s;aw at the Pe&s;aiac falls in New-Jer&s;ey, who had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ix and twenty years in a cradle, acknowledged that he had venereal de&s;ires, and wi&s;hed to be married, for the Doctor adds, he had a &s;en&s;e of religion upon his fragment of mind, and of cour&s;e did not wi&s;h to gratify that appetite in an unlawful manner.</P>
<P>III. How is animal life &s;upported in per&s;ons who pa&s;s many days, and even weeks without food, and in &s;ome in&s;tances without drinks? Long fa&s;t|ing is u&s;ually the effect of di&s;ea&s;e, of nece&s;&s;ity, or of a principle of religion. When it ari&s;es from the fir&s;t cau&s;e, the actions of life are kept up by the &s;timulus of di&s;ea&s;e. The ab&s;ence of food when accidental, or &s;ubmitted to as a means of producing moral happine&s;s, is &s;upplied,</P>
<P N="1">1. By the &s;timulus of a full gall bladder. This &s;tate of the receptacle of bile, has generally been
<PB N="47" REF="036255_0053_1008664C915BC578">
found to accompany an empty &s;tomach. The bile is &s;ometimes ab&s;orbed, and imparts a yellow co|lor to the &s;kin of per&s;ons who &s;uffer or die of famine.</P>
<P N="2">2. By increa&s;ed acrimony in all the &s;ecretions and excretions of the body. The &s;aliva becomes &s;o acrid by long fa&s;ting, as to excoriate the gums, and the breath acquires not only a foetor, but a pungency &s;o active, as to draw tears from the eyes of per&s;ons who are expo&s;ed to it.</P>
<P N="3">3. By increa&s;ed &s;en&s;ibility and excitability in the &s;en&s;e of touch. The blind man mentioned by Mr. Boyle who could di&s;tingui&s;h colors by his fingers, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this talent only after fa&s;ting. Even a draught of any kind of liquor deprived him of it. I have taken notice in my account of the yellow fever in Philadelphia in the year 1793, of the effects of a diet bordering upon fa&s;ting for &s;ix weeks, in producing a quickne&s;s and correct|ne&s;s in my perceptions of the &s;tate of the pul&s;e, which I had never experienced before.</P>
<P N="4">4. By an increa&s;e of activity in the under|&s;tanding and pa&s;&s;ions. Game&s;ters often improve the exerci&s;es of their minds when they are about to play for a large &s;um of money, by living for a
<PB N="48" REF="036255_0054_1008664F1CB05088">
day or two upon roa&s;ted apples and cold water. Where the pa&s;&s;ions are excited into preternatural action, the ab&s;ence of the &s;timulus of food is &s;carcely felt. I &s;hall hereafter mention the influ|ence of the de&s;ire of life, upon its pre&s;ervation under all circum&s;tances. It acts with peculiar force when fa&s;ting is accidental. But when it is &s;ubmitted to as a religious duty, it is accompanied by &s;entiments and feelings which more than ba|lance the ab&s;traction of aliment. The body of Mo&s;es was &s;u&s;tained, probably without a miracle, during an ab&s;tinence of forty days and forty nights, by the plea&s;ure he derived from conver&s;|ing with his Maker "Face to face, as a man &s;peak|ing with his friend."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exodus xxxiii. 11. xxxiv. 28.</NOTE></P>
<P>I remarked formerly that the veins di&s;cover no deficiency of blood in per&s;ons who die of famine. Death from this cau&s;e &s;eems to be le&s;s the effect of the want of food, than of the combined and exce&s;|&s;ive operation of the &s;timuli, which &s;upply its place in the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>IV. We come now to a difficult inquiry, and that is, how is life &s;upported during the total ab|&s;traction of external and internal &s;timuli which
<PB N="49" REF="036255_0055_100866509F8BF550">
takes place in a&s;phixia, or in apparent death, from all its numerous cau&s;es?</P>
<P>I took notice in a former lecture, that ordinary life con&s;i&s;ted in the excitement, and excitability of the different parts of the body; and that they were occa&s;ionally changed into each other. In apparent death from violent emotions of the mind, from the &s;udden impre&s;&s;ion of mia&s;mata, or from drowning, there is a lo&s;s of excitement; but the excitability of the &s;y&s;tem remains for minutes, and in &s;ome in|&s;tances for hours afterwards unimpaired, provided the accident which produced the lo&s;s of excite|ment has not been attended with &s;uch exertions as are calculated to wa&s;te it. If for example, a per|&s;on &s;hould fall &s;uddenly into the water, without brui&s;ing his body, and &s;ink before his fears, or exertions had time to di&s;&s;ipate his excitability; his recovery from apparent death might be effected by the gentle action of heat, or frictions upon his body, &s;o as to convert his accumulated excitability gradually into excitement. The &s;ame condition of the &s;y&s;tem takes place when apparent death oc|curs from freezing, and a recovery is accompli&s;hed by the &s;ame gentle application of &s;timuli, provided the organization of the body be not injured, or its excitability wa&s;ted, by violent exertions previ|ou&s;ly to its freezing. This excitability is the
<PB N="50" REF="036255_0056_100866532425A598">
vehicle of motion, and motion when continued long enough produces &s;en&s;ation, which is &s;oon fol|lowed by thought; and in the&s;e, I &s;aid formerly, con&s;i&s;ts perfect life in the human body.</P>
<P>For this explanation of the manner in which life is &s;u&s;pended, and revived in per&s;ons apparently dead from cold, I am indebted to Mr. John Hun|ter, who &s;uppo&s;es, if it were po&s;&s;ible for the body to be <HI>&s;uddenly</HI> frozen by an in&s;tantaneous ab&s;tracti|on of its heat, life might be continued for many years in a &s;u&s;pended &s;tate, and revived at plea&s;ure; provided the body were pre&s;erved con&s;tantly in a temperature barely &s;ufficient to prevent reanima|tion, and never &s;o great, as to endanger the de|&s;truction of any organic part. The re&s;u&s;citation of infects that have been in a torpid &s;tate for months, and perhaps years, in &s;ub&s;tances that have pre&s;erved their organization, &s;hould at lea&s;t defend this bold propo&s;ition from being treated as chimerical. The effu&s;ions even of the imagination of &s;uch men as Mr. Hunter, are entitled to re|&s;pect. They often become the germs of future di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>In that &s;tate of &s;u&s;pended animation which oc|curs in acute di&s;ea&s;es, and which has &s;ometimes been denominated a <HI>trance:</HI> the &s;y&s;tem is nearly in
<PB N="51" REF="036255_0057_100866562ED0E4D0">
the &s;ame excitable &s;tate that it is in apparent death from drowning, and freezing. Re&s;u&s;citation in the&s;e ca&s;es is not the effect as in tho&s;e which have been mentioned of artificial applications made to the body for that purpo&s;e. It appears to be &s;pon|taneous; but it is produced by impre&s;&s;ions made upon the ears, and by the operations of the mind in dreams. Of the action of the&s;e &s;timuli upon the body in its apparently lifele&s;s &s;tate, I have &s;atisfied my&s;elf by many facts. I once attended a citizen of Philadelphia, who died of a pulmonary di&s;ea&s;e in the 80th year of his age. A few days before his death he begged that he might not be interred until one week after the u&s;ual &s;igns of life had left his body, and gave as a rea&s;on for this reque&s;t, that he had when a young man, died to all appearance of the yellow fever in one of the We&s;t-India i&s;lands.&mdash;In this &s;ituation he di&s;tinctly heard the per&s;ons who attended him, fix upon the time, and place, of burying him. The horror of being put under ground alive, produced &s;uch di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing emotions in his mind, as to diffu&s;e motion throughout his body, and finally excited in him all the u&s;ual functions of life. In Dr. Creighton's e&s;&s;ay upon mental derangement there is a hi&s;tory of a ca&s;e nearly of a &s;imilar nature. "A young lady (&s;ays the Doctor) an attendant on the prince&s;s of&mdash;, after having been confined to her bed
<PB N="52" REF="036255_0058_1008665875D72460">
for a great length of time, with a violent nervous di&s;order, was at la&s;t, to all appearance, deprived of life. Her lips were quite pale, her face re&s;em|bled the countenance of a dead per&s;on, and her body grew cold. She was removed from the room in which <HI>&s;he died,</HI> was laid in a coffin, and the day for her funeral was fixed on. The day arrived, and according to the cu&s;tom of the country, fu|neral &s;ongs and hymns were &s;ung before the door. Ju&s;t as the people were about to nail on the lid of the coffin, a kind of per&s;piration was ob&s;erved on the &s;urface of her body. She recovered. The following is the account &s;he gave of her &s;en&s;ations; &s;he &s;aid, "It &s;eemed to her as if in a dream, that &s;he was really dead; yet &s;he was perfectly con&s;ci|ous of all that happened around her. She di&s;|tinctly heard her friends &s;peaking and lamenting her death at the &s;ide of her coffin. She felt them pull on the dead clothes, and lay her in it. This feeling produced a mental anxiety which &s;he could not de&s;cribe. She tried to cry out, but her mind was without power, and could not act on her body. She had the contradictory feeling as if &s;he were in her own body, and not in it, at the &s;ame time. It was equally impo&s;&s;ible for her to &s;tretch out her arm or open her eyes, as to cry, although &s;he continually endeavoured to do &s;o. The inter|nal angui&s;h of her mind was at its utmo&s;t height
<PB N="53" REF="036255_0059_10086659F89E5E98">
when the funeral hymns began to be &s;ung, and when the lid of the coffin was about to be nailed on. The thought that &s;he was to be buried alive was the fir&s;t which gave activity to her mind, and enabled it to operate on her corporeal frame."</P>
<P>Where the ears lo&s;e their capacity of being act|ed upon by &s;timuli, the mind by its operations in dreams, becomes a &s;ource of impre&s;&s;ions which again &s;et the wheels of life in motion. There is an account publi&s;hed by Dr. Arnold in his ob&s;er|vations upon in&s;anity,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 298.</NOTE> of a certain John Engel|breght a German, who was believed to be dead, and who was evidently re&s;u&s;citated by the exerci&s;es of his mind upon &s;ubjects which were of a delight|ful and &s;timulating nature. This hi&s;tory &s;hall be taken from Mr. Engelbreght's words. "It was on Thur&s;day noon (&s;ays he) about 12 o'clock when I perceived that death was making his approached upon me from the lower parts upwards, in&s;omuch that my whole body became &s;tiff. I had no feel|ing left in my hands and feet, neither in any other part of my whole body, nor was I at la&s;t able to &s;peak or &s;ee, for my mouth now becoming very &s;tiff, I was no longer able to open it, nor did I feel it any longer. My eyes al&s;o broke in my
<PB N="54" REF="036255_0060_1008665B80ABB120">
head in &s;uch a manner that I di&s;tinctly felt it. For all that, I under&s;tood what they &s;aid, when they were praying by me, and I di&s;tinctly heard them &s;ay, feel his legs, how &s;tiff, and cold they have become. This I heard di&s;tinctly, but I had no perception of their touch. I heard the watchman cry 11 o'clock, but at 12 o'clock my hearing left me. After relating his pa&s;&s;age from the body to heaven with the velocity of an arrow &s;hot from a cro&s;s bow, he proceeds, and &s;ays that as he was twelve hours in dying, &s;o he was twelve hours in returning to life. "As I died (&s;ays he) from be|neath upwards, &s;o I revived again the contrary way from above to beneath, or from top to toe. Being conveyed back from the heavenly glory, I began to hear again &s;omething of what they were praying for me, in the &s;ame room with me. Thus was my hearing, the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;en&s;e I recovered. Af|ter this I began to have a perception of my eyes, &s;o that by little and little, my whole body became &s;trong, and &s;prightly, and no &s;ooner did I get a feeling of my legs and feet, than I aro&s;e and &s;tood firm upon them with a firmne&s;s I had never enjoy|ed before. The heavenly joy I had experienced, invigorated me to &s;uch a degree, that people were a&s;toni&s;hed at my rapid, and almo&s;t in&s;tantaneous recovery."</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="036255_0061_1008665F9D956CE0">
The explanation, I have given of the cau&s;e of re|&s;u&s;citation in this man, will &s;erve to refute a belief in a &s;uppo&s;ed migration of the &s;oul from the body in ca&s;es of apparent death. The imagination, it is true, u&s;ually conducts the whole mind to the abodes of happy or mi&s;erable &s;pirits, but it acts here in the &s;ame way that it does when it tran&s;|ports it in common dreams, to numerous and di&s;|tant parts of the world.</P>
<P>There is nothing &s;upernatural in Mr. Engel|breght being invigorated by his &s;uppo&s;ed flight to heaven. Plea&s;ant dreams always &s;timulate and &s;trengthen the body, while dreams which are ac|companied with di&s;tre&s;s, or labour debilitate, and fatigue it.</P>

<P>Let us next take a view of the &s;tate of animal life in the different inhabitants of our globe, as varied by the circum&s;tances of civilization, diet, &s;ituation and climate.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="036255_0062_10086661EC5770C0">
I. In the Indians of the northern latitudes of America, there is often a defect of the &s;timulus of aliment, and of the under&s;tanding and pa&s;&s;ions. Their vacant countenances, and their long and di&s;|gu&s;ting taciturnity, are the effects of the want of action in their brains from a deficiency of ideas; and their tranquillity under all the common cir|cum&s;tances of irritation, plea&s;ure or grief, are the re&s;ult of an ab&s;ence of pa&s;&s;ion; for they hold it to be di&s;graceful to &s;hew any outward &s;igns of anger&punc; joy, or even of dome&s;tic affection. This account of the Indian character, I know is con|trary to that which is given of it by Rou&s;&s;eau, and &s;everal other writers, who have attempted to prove that man may become perfect and happy, without the aids of civilization and religion. This opi|nion is contradicted by the experience of all ages, and is rendered ridiculous by the facts which are well a&s;certained in the hi&s;tory of the cu&s;toms and habits of our American &s;avages. In a cold climate they are the mo&s;t mi&s;erable beings upon the face of the earth. The greate&s;t part of their time is &s;pent in &s;leep, or under the alternate influence of hunger and gluttony. They moreover indulge in vices which are alike contrary to moral and phy&s;ical happine&s;s. It is in con&s;equence of the&s;e habits, that they di&s;cover &s;o early the marks of old age, and that &s;o few of them are long-lived. The
<PB N="57" REF="036255_0063_100866636F1D2840">
ab&s;ence and diminution of many of the &s;timuli of life in the&s;e people is &s;upplied in part, by the vio|lent exertions with which they hunt, and carry on war, and by the extravagant manner with which they afterwards celebrate their exploits, in their &s;avage dances and &s;ongs.</P>
<P>II. In the inhabitants of the torrid regions of Africa, there is a deficiency of labor; for the earth produces &s;pontaneou&s;ly nearly all the &s;u&s;te|nance they require. Their under&s;tandings and pa&s;|&s;ions are moreover in a torpid &s;tate. But the ab&s;ence of bodily and mental &s;timuli in the&s;e people, is amply &s;upplied by the con&s;tant heat of the &s;un, by the profu&s;e u&s;e of &s;pices in their diet, and by the pa&s;&s;ion for mu&s;ical &s;ounds which &s;o univer&s;ally characteri&s;es the African nations.</P>
<P>III. In Greenland the body is expo&s;ed during a long winter to &s;uch a degree of cold as to re|duce the pul&s;e to 40, or 50 &s;trokes in a minute. But the effects of this cold in le&s;&s;ening the quantity of life, are obviated in part by the heat of clo&s;e &s;tove rooms, by warm clothing, and by the pecu|liar nature of the aliment of the Greenlanders, which con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of animal food, of dried fi&s;h, and of whale oil. They prefer the la&s;t of tho&s;e articles in &s;o rancid a &s;tate, that it imparts a
<PB N="58" REF="036255_0064_10086665AE53A268">
faetor to their per&s;piration which, Mr. Crantz &s;ays, renders even their churches offen&s;ive to &s;trangers. I need hardly add, that a diet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch diffu&s;ible qualities, cannot fail of being highly &s;ti|mulating. It is remarkable that the food of all the northern nations of Europe is compo&s;ed of &s;timulating animal, or vegetable matters, and that the u&s;e of &s;piritous liquors is univer&s;al among them.</P>
<P>IV. Let us next turn our eyes to the mi&s;erable inhabitants of tho&s;e ea&s;tern countries which compo&s;e the Ottoman empire. Here we behold life in its mo&s;t feeble &s;tate, not only from the ab&s;ence of phy&s;ical, but of other &s;timuli which operate upon the inhabitants of other parts of the world. Among the poor people of Turkey there is a general deficiency of aliment. Mr. Volney in his travels tells us "That the diet of the Bedouins &s;eldom exceeds &s;ix ounces a day, and that it con|&s;i&s;ts of &s;ix or &s;even dates &s;oaked in butter-milk, and afterwards mixed with a little &s;weet milk, or curds."&mdash;There is likewi&s;e a general deficiency among them of &s;timulus, from the operations of the mental faculties; for &s;uch is the de&s;poti&s;m of the government in Turkey, that it weakens not only the under&s;tanding; but it annihilates all that immen&s;e &s;ource of &s;timuli which ari&s;es from the exerci&s;e of the dome&s;tic and public affections. A
<PB N="59" REF="036255_0065_100866685E628C98">
Turk lives wholly to him&s;elf. In point of time, he occupies only the moment in which he exi&s;ts; for his futurity, as to life and property, belongs altogether to his ma&s;ter. Fear is the reigning principle of his actions, and hope and joy &s;eldom add a &s;ingle pul&s;ation to his heart. Tyranny even impo&s;es a re&s;traint upon the &s;timulus which ari&s;es from conver&s;ation, for "They &s;peak (&s;ays Mr. Vol|ney) with a &s;low feeble voice, as if the lungs wanted &s;trength to propel air enough through the glottis to form di&s;tinct articulate &s;ounds." The &s;ame traveller adds, that "They are &s;low in all their motions, that their bodies are &s;mall, that they have &s;mall evacuations, and that their blood is &s;o de&s;titute of &s;ero&s;ity, that nothing but the greate&s;t heat can pre&s;erve its fluidity." The defi|ciency of aliment, and the ab&s;ence of mental &s;ti|muli in the&s;e people is &s;upplied,</P>
<P N="1">1. By the heat of their climate.</P>
<P N="2">2. By their pa&s;&s;ion for mu&s;ical &s;ounds and fine clothes, and</P>
<P N="3">3. By their general u&s;e of coffee and opium.</P>
<P>The more debilitated the body is, the more forcibly the&s;e &s;timuli act upon it. Hence accord|ing
<PB N="60" REF="036255_0066_1008666BD49D7740">
to Mr. Volney, the Bedouins, who&s;e &s;lender diet has been mentioned, enjoy good health; for this con&s;i&s;ts not in &s;trength, but in an exact proportion being kept up between the excitability of the body, and the number and force of the &s;timuli which act upon it.</P>
<P>V. Many of the ob&s;ervations which have been made upon the inhabitants of Africa, and of the Turki&s;h dominions, apply to the inhabitants of China, and the Ea&s;t Indies. They want in many in&s;tances the &s;timulus of animal food. Their minds are moreover in a &s;tate too languid to act with much force upon their bodies. The ab&s;ence and deficiency of the&s;e &s;timuli are &s;upplied by,</P>
<P N="1">1. The heat of the climate in the &s;outhern parts of tho&s;e countries.</P>
<P N="2">2. By a vegetable diet abounding in nouri&s;h|ment, particularly rice and beans.</P>
<P N="3">3. By the u&s;e of tea in China, and by a &s;timu|lating coffee made of the dried and toa&s;ted &s;eeds of the datura &s;tramonium, in the neighbourhood of the Indian coa&s;t. Some of the&s;e nations likewi&s;e chew &s;timulating &s;ub&s;tances, as too many of our citizens do tobacco.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="036255_0067_1008666D57FFA958">
Among the poor and depre&s;&s;ed &s;ubjects of the governments of the middle and &s;outhern parts of Europe, the deficiency of the &s;timulus of whole|&s;ome food, of clothing, of fuel, and of liberty, is &s;upplied in &s;ome countries by the invigorating influence of the Chri&s;tian religion upon animal life; and in others, by the general u&s;e of tea, coffee, garlic, onions, opium, tobacco, malt liquors, and ardent &s;pirits. The u&s;e of each of the&s;e &s;timuli &s;eems to be regulated by the circum&s;tances of cli|mate. In cold countries where the earth yields its increa&s;e with reluctance, and where vegetable ali|ment is &s;carce, the want of the &s;timulus of di&s;ten|tion which that &s;pecies of food is principally calcu|lated to produce, is &s;ought for in that, of ardent &s;pirits. To the &s;outhward of 40&deg; a &s;ub&s;titute for the di&s;tention from mild vegetable food is &s;ought for, in onions, garlic and tobacco. But further, a uniform climate calls for more of the&s;e artificial &s;ti|muli than a climate that is expo&s;ed to the alternate action of heat and cold, winds and calms, and of wet and dry weather. Savages and ignorant people likewi&s;e require more of them than per&s;ons of civilized manners, and cultivated under&s;tandings. It would &s;eem from the&s;e facts that man cannot ex|i&s;t without <HI>&s;en&s;ation</HI> of &s;ome kind, and that when it is not derived from natural means, it will always be &s;ought for in &s;uch as are artificial.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="036255_0068_100866700CB43A50">
In no part of the human &s;pecies, is animal life in a more perfect &s;tate than in the inhabitants of Great Britain,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haller's Elementa Phy&s;iologiae, vol. viii. p. 2. p. 107.</NOTE> and the United States of America. With all the natural &s;timuli that have been menti|oned, they are con&s;tantly under the invigorating influence of liberty. There is an indi&s;&s;oluble uni|on between moral, political and phy&s;ical happi|ne&s;s; and if it be true, that elective and repre&s;en|tative governments are mo&s;t favourable to indivi|dual, as well as national pro&s;perity, it follows of cour&s;e, that they are mo&s;t favourable to animal life. But this opinion does not re&s;t upon an induc|tion derived from the relation, which truths up|on all &s;ubjects bear to each other. Many facts prove, animal life to exi&s;t in a larger quantity and for a longer time, in the enlightened and happy &s;tate of Connecticut, in which republican liberty has exi&s;ted above one hundred and fifty years, than in any other country upon the &s;urface of the globe.</P>
<P>It remains now to mention certain mental &s;timuli which act nearly alike in the production of animal life, upon the individuals of all the nations in the world. They are,</P>
<P N="1">1. The de&s;ire of life. This principle &s;o deeply, and univer&s;ally implanted in human nature, acts
<PB N="63" REF="036255_0069_100866734188C6C8">
very powerfully in &s;upporting our exi&s;tence. It has been ob&s;erved to prolong life. Sickly tra|vellers by &s;ea and land, often live under circum|&s;tances of the greate&s;t weakne&s;s, till they reach their native country, and then expire in the bo|&s;om of their friends. This de&s;ire of life often turns the &s;cale in favor of a recovery in acute di&s;ea&s;es. Its influence will appear, from the difference in the periods in which death was induced in two per|&s;ons, who were actuated by oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ions with re&s;pect to life. Atticus, we are told, died of volun|tary ab&s;tinence from food in five days. In Sir Wil|liam Hamilton's account of the earthquake at Cala|bria, we read of a girl who lived eleven days without food, before &s;he expired. In the former ca&s;e, life was &s;hortened by an aver&s;ion from it; in the latter, it was protracted by the de&s;ire of it. The late Mr. Bri&s;&s;ot in his vi&s;it to this city, informed me that the application of animal magneti&s;m (in which he was a believer) had in no in&s;tance cured a di&s;|ea&s;e in a We&s;t India &s;lave. Perhaps it was ren|dered inert by its not being accompanied by a &s;trong de&s;ire of life; for this principle exi&s;ts in a more feeble &s;tate in &s;laves than in freemen. It is po&s;&s;ible likewi&s;e the wills and imaginations of the&s;e degraded people may have become &s;o paralytic by &s;lavery, as to be incapable of being excited by the impre&s;&s;ion of this fanciful remedy.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="64" REF="036255_0070_10086675873FE560">
2. The love of money &s;ets the whole animal machine in motion. Hearts which are in&s;en&s;ible to the &s;timuli of religion, patrioti&s;m, love, and even of the dome&s;tic affections, are excited into action by this pa&s;&s;ion. The city of Philadelphia between the 10th and 15th of Augu&s;t 1791, will long be remembered by contemplative men, for having furni&s;hed the mo&s;t extraordinary proofs of the &s;timulus of the love of money upon the hu|man body. A new &s;cene of &s;peculation was pro|duced at that time by the &s;crip of the bank of the United &s;tates. It excited febrile di&s;ea&s;es in three per&s;ons who became my patients. In one of them, the acqui&s;ition of twelve thou&s;and dollars in a few minutes by a lucky &s;ale, brought on madne&s;s which terminated in death in a few days.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Mead relates upon the authority of Dr. Hales, that more of the &s;ucce&s;sful &s;peculators in the South Sea Scheme of 1720 became in&s;ane, than of tho&s;e who had been ruined by it.</NOTE> The whole city felt the impul&s;e of this paroxy&s;m of avarice. The &s;low and ordinary means of earning money were de&s;erted, and men of every profe&s;&s;ion and trade, were &s;een in all our &s;treets ha&s;tening to the coffee hou&s;e, where the agitation of countenance, and the de&s;ultory manners, of all the per&s;ons who were intere&s;ted in this &s;pecies of gaming, exhibited a truer picture of a bedlam, than of
<PB N="65" REF="036255_0071_100866770AC09040">
a place appropriated to the tran&s;action of mer|cantile bu&s;ine&s;s. But further, the love of money di&s;covers its &s;timulus upon the body in a peculiar manner in the games of cards and dice. I have heard of a gentleman in Virginia who pa&s;&s;ed two whole days and nights in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion at a card table, and it is related in the life of a noted game|&s;ter in Ireland, that when he was &s;o ill as to be unable to ri&s;e from his chair, he would &s;uddenly revive when brought to the hazard table, by hearing the rattling of the dice.</P>
<P N="3">3. Public amu&s;ements of all kinds, &s;uch as a hor&s;e race, a cockpit, a cha&s;e, the theatre, the circus, ma&s;querades, public dinners and tea par|ties, all exert an artificial &s;timulus upon the &s;y&s;tem, and thus &s;upply the defect of the rational exerci&s;es of the mind.</P>
<P N="4">4. The love of dre&s;s is not confined in its &s;timulating operation to per&s;ons in health. It acts perceptibly in &s;ome ca&s;es upon invalids. I have heard of a gentleman in South Carolina, who always relieved him&s;elf of a fit of low &s;pirits by chang|ing his dre&s;s; and I believe there are few people who do not feel them&s;elves enlivened, by putting on a new &s;uit of clothes.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="66" REF="036255_0072_1008667895C30B80">
5. Novelty is an immen&s;e &s;ource of agreeable &s;timuli. Companions, &s;tudies, plea&s;ures, modes of bu&s;ine&s;s, pro&s;pects, and &s;ituations with re&s;pect to town, and country, or to different countries, that are <HI>new,</HI> all exert an invigorating influence upon health and life.</P>
<P N="6">6. The love of fame acts in various ways; but its &s;timulus is mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and durable in military life. It counteracts in many in&s;tances the debilitat|ing effects of hunger, cold and labor. It has &s;ome|times done more, by removing the weakne&s;s which is connected with many di&s;ea&s;es. In &s;everal in|&s;tances it has a&s;&s;i&s;ted the hard&s;hips of a camp life, in curing pulmonary con&s;umption.</P>
<P N="7">7. The love of country is a deep &s;eated principle of action in the human brea&s;t. Its &s;timulus is &s;ome|times &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, as to induce di&s;ea&s;e in per&s;ons who recently migrate, and &s;ettle in foreign coun|tries.&mdash;It appears in various forms; but exi&s;ts mo&s;t frequently in the &s;olicitude, labors, attachments, and hatred of party &s;pirit. All the&s;e act forcibly in &s;upporting animal life. It is becau&s;e newspapers are &s;uppo&s;ed to contain the mea&s;ure of the happi|ne&s;s, or mi&s;ery of our country, that they are &s;o in|tere&s;ting to all cla&s;&s;es of people. Tho&s;e vehicles of intelligence, and of public plea&s;ure or pain, are
<PB N="67" REF="036255_0073_1008667CC680D350">
frequently de&s;ired with the impatience of a meal, and they often produce the &s;ame &s;timulating effects upon the body.</P>
<P N="8">8. The different religions of the world, by the activity they excite in the mind, have a &s;en&s;ible in|fluence upon human life. Athei&s;m is the wor&s;t of &s;edatives to the under&s;tanding, and pa&s;&s;ions. It is the ab&s;traction of thought from the mo&s;t &s;ublime, and of love, from the mo&s;t perfect of all po&s;&s;ible objects. Man is as naturally a religious, as he is a &s;ocial, and dome&s;tic animal; and the &s;ame violence is done to his mental faculties, by robbing him of a belief in a God, that is done, by dooming him to live in a cell, deprived of the objects and plea&s;ures of &s;ocial and dome&s;tic life. The nece&s;&s;ary and im|mutable connection between the texture of the hu|man mind, and the wor&s;hip of an object of &s;ome kind, has lately been demon&s;trated by the athei&s;ts of Europe, who after rejecting the true God, have in&s;tituted the wor&s;hip of nature, of fortune, and of human rea&s;on; and in &s;ome in&s;tances, with cere|monies of the mo&s;t expen&s;ive and &s;plendid kind. Religions are friendly to animal life, in proportion as they elevate the under&s;tanding, and act upon the pa&s;&s;ions of hope and love. It will readily occur to you, that Chri&s;tianity when believed, and obeyed, according to its original con&s;i&s;tency with it&s;elf, and
<PB N="68" REF="036255_0074_1008667F0B84C6B8">
with the divine attributes, is more calculated to produce tho&s;e effects, than any other religion in the world.&mdash;Such is the &s;alutary operation of its doc|trines, and precepts upon health and life, that if its divine authority re&s;ted upon no other argument, this alone would be &s;ufficient to recommend it to our belief. How long mankind may continue to prefer &s;ub&s;tituted pur&s;uits and plea&s;ures, to this invigorating &s;timulus, is uncertain; but the time we are a&s;&s;ured will come, when the under&s;tanding &s;hall be elevated from its pre&s;ent inferior objects, and the luxated pa&s;&s;ions be reduced to their origi|nal order.&mdash;This change in the mind of man, I believe, will be effected only by the influence of the Chri&s;tian religion, after all the efforts of human rea|&s;on to produce it, by means of civilization, philo|&s;ophy, liberty, and government, have been exhau&s;t|ed to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus far, gentlemen, we have con&s;idered animal life as it re&s;pects the human &s;pecies; but the prin|ciples I am endeavouring to e&s;tabli&s;h, require that we &s;hould take a view of it in animals of every &s;pecies, in all of which we &s;hall find it depends up|on the &s;ame cau&s;es, as in the human body.</P>
<P>And here I &s;hall begin by remarking, that if we &s;hould di&s;cover the &s;timuli which &s;upport life in
<PB N="69" REF="036255_0075_100866808E7D59C0">
certain animals, to be fewer in number, or weaker in force than tho&s;e which &s;upport it in our &s;pecies; we mu&s;t re&s;olve it into that attribute of the Deity which &s;eems to have delighted in variety in all his works.</P>
<P>The following ob&s;ervations apply more or le&s;s, to all the animals upon our globe.</P>
<P N="1">1. They all po&s;&s;e&s;s either hearts, lungs, brains, nerves, or mu&s;cular fibres. It is as yet a contro|ver&s;y among naturali&s;ts whether animal life can ex|i&s;t without a brain; but no one has denied, mu&s;|cular fibres, and of cour&s;e contractility, or excita|bility to belong to animal life in all its &s;hapes.</P>
<P N="2">2. They all require more or le&s;s air for their exi&s;tence. Even the &s;nail inhales it for &s;even months under ground, through a pellicle which it weaves out of &s;lime, as a covering for its body. If this pellicle at any time become too thick to admit the air; the &s;nail opens a pa&s;&s;age in it for that purpo&s;e. Now air we know acts powerfully in &s;upporting animal life.</P>
<P N="3">3. Many of them po&s;&s;e&s;s heat equal to that of the human body. Birds po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;everal degrees beyond it. Now heat, it was &s;aid formerly, acts with great force, in the production of animal life.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="70" REF="036255_0076_10086682DF704760">
4. They all feed upon &s;ub&s;tances more or le&s;s &s;timulating to their bodies. Even water it&s;elf, che|mi&s;try has taught us, affords an aliment not only &s;timulating, but nouri&s;hing to many animals.</P>
<P N="5">5. Many of them po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;en&s;es, more acute and excitable, than the &s;ame organs in the human &s;pecies. The&s;e expo&s;e &s;urfaces for the action of ex|ternal impre&s;&s;ions, that &s;upply the ab&s;ence, or defi|ciency of mental faculties.</P>
<P N="6">6. Such of them as are devoid of &s;en&s;ibility, po&s;|&s;e&s;s an uncommon portion of contractility, or &s;im|ple excitability. This is mo&s;t evident in the Poly|pus. When cut to pieces, it appears to feel little or no pain.</P>
<P N="7">7. They all po&s;&s;e&s;s locomotive powers in a greater or le&s;s degree, and of cour&s;e are acted up|on by the &s;timulus of mu&s;cular motion.</P>
<P N="8">8. Mo&s;t of them appear to feel a &s;timulus, from the gratification of their appetites for food, and for venereal plea&s;ures, far more powerful than that which is felt by our &s;pecies from the &s;ame cau&s;es. I &s;hall hereafter mention &s;ome facts from Spalanzani upon the &s;ubject of generation, that will prove the &s;timulus, from venery, to be &s;tronge&s;t in
<PB N="71" REF="036255_0077_10086686346B47F0">
tho&s;e animals, in which other &s;timuli act with the lea&s;t force. Thus the male frog during its long connection with its female, &s;uffers its limbs to be amputated, without di&s;covering the lea&s;t mark of pain, and without relaxing its hold of the object of its embraces.</P>
<P N="9">9. In many animals we behold evident marks of under&s;tanding, and pa&s;&s;ion. The elephant, the fox and the ant, exhibit &s;trong proofs of thought&punc; and where is the &s;chool boy that cannot bear te&s;ti|mony to the anger of the bee, and the wa&s;p?</P>
<P N="10">10. But what &s;hall we &s;ay of tho&s;e animals, which pa&s;s long winters in a &s;tate in which there is an apparent ab&s;ence of the &s;timuli of heat, exer|ci&s;e and the motion of the blood. Life in the&s;e animals is probably &s;upported,</P>
<P N="1">1. By &s;uch an accumulation of excitability, as to yield to impre&s;&s;ions, which to us are impercep|tible.</P>
<P N="2">2. By the &s;timulus of aliment in a &s;tate of di|ge&s;tion in the &s;tomach, or by the &s;timulus of ali|ment re&s;trained from dige&s;tion by means of cold; for Mr. John Hunter has proved by an experiment
<PB N="72" REF="036255_0078_10086688A4E20440">
on a frog, that cold below a certain degree, checks that animal proce&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. By the con&s;tant action of air upon their bodies.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible life may exi&s;t in the&s;e animals, during their hybernation, in the total ab&s;ence of impre&s;&s;ion and motion of every kind. This may be the ca&s;e where the torpor from cold, has been <HI>&s;uddenly</HI> brought upon their bodies. Excitability here, is in an accumulated, but quie&s;cent &s;tate.</P>
<P N="11">11. It remains only under this head to inquire; in what manner is life &s;upported in tho&s;e animals which live in a cold element, and who&s;e blood is &s;ometimes but a little above the freezing point? It will be a &s;ufficient an&s;wer to this que&s;tion to remark, that heat and cold are relative terms, and that different animals according to their organiza|tion, require very different degrees of heat for their exi&s;tence. Thirty-two degrees of it are probably as &s;timulating to &s;ome of the&s;e cold blooded animals (as they are called) as 70&deg;, or 80&deg; are to the human body.</P>
<P>It might afford additional &s;upport to the doctrine of animal life, which I have delivered, to point
<PB N="73" REF="036255_0079_1008668A287F3BB8">
out the manner in which life and growth are pro|duced in vegetables of all kinds. But this &s;ubject belongs to the profe&s;&s;or of botany, and natural hi&s;|tory,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Barton.</NOTE> who is amply qualified to do it ju&s;tice. I &s;hall only remark, that vegetable life is as much the offspring of &s;timuli as animal, and that &s;kill in agriculture con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in the proper applica|tion of them. The &s;eed of a plant, like an ani|mal body, has no principle of life within it&s;elf. If pre&s;erved for years in a drawer, or in earth be|low the &s;timulating influence of heat, air and water, it di&s;covers no &s;ign of vegetation. It grows, like an animal, only in con&s;equence of &s;timuli acting upon its <HI>capacity</HI> of life.</P>
<P>From a review of what has been &s;aid of animal life in all its numerous forms and modifications; we &s;ee that it is as much an effect of impre&s;&s;ions upon a peculiar &s;pecies of matter, as &s;ound is of the &s;troke of a hammer upon a bell, or mu&s;ic, of the motion of the bow upon the &s;trings of a violin. I exclude therefore the intelligent princi|ple of Whytt, the medical mind of Stahl, the healing powers of Cullen, and the vital principle of John Hunter, as much from the body, as I do an intelligent principle from air, fire, and water.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="036255_0080_1008396F38540370">
It is no uncommon thing for the &s;implicity of cau&s;es, to be lo&s;t in the magnitude of their effects. By contemplating the wonderful functions of life, we have &s;trangely overlooked the numerous and ob&s;cure circum&s;tances which produce it. Thus the humble but true origin of power in the people, is often forgotten in the &s;plendor and pride of go|vernments. It is not nece&s;&s;ary to be acquainted with the preci&s;e nature of that form of matter, which is capable of producing life, from impre&s;&s;i|ons made upon it. It is &s;ufficient for our purpo&s;e, to know the fact. It is immaterial moreover whe|ther this matter derive its power of being acted upon wholly from the brain, or whether it be in part inherent in animal fibres. The inferences are the &s;ame in favour of life being the effect of &s;timuli, and of its being as truly mechanical, as the movements of a clock from the pre&s;&s;ure of its weights, or the pa&s;&s;age of a &s;hip in the water, from the impul&s;e of winds, and tide.</P>
<P>The infinity of effects from &s;imilar cau&s;es, has often been taken notice of in the works of the Creator. It would &s;eem as if they had all been made after one pattern. The late di&s;covery of the cau&s;e of combu&s;tion, has thrown great light upon our &s;ubject. Wood and coal are no longer believ|ed to contain a principle of fire. The heat and
<PB N="75" REF="036255_0081_10086690C5434270">
flame they emit, are derived from an agent alto|gether external to them. They are produced by a matter which is ab&s;orbed from the air, by means of its decompo&s;ition. This matter acts upon the predi&s;po&s;ition of the fuel to receive it, in the &s;ame way that &s;timuli act upon the human body. The two agents differ only in their effects. The former produces the de&s;truction of the bodies upon which it acts; while the latter excite the more gentle, and durable motions of life. Com|mon language in expre&s;&s;ing the&s;e effects is correct, as far as it relates to their cau&s;e. We &s;peak of a coal of fire being <HI>alive,</HI> and of the <HI>flame</HI> of life.</P>
<P>The cau&s;es of life which I have delivered, will receive con&s;iderable &s;upport, by contra&s;ting them with the cau&s;es of death. This cata&s;trophe of the body con&s;i&s;ts in &s;uch a change induced on it by di&s;|ea&s;e, or old age, as to prevent its exhibiting the phaenomena of life. It is brought on,</P>
<P N="1">1. By the ab&s;traction of all the &s;timuli which &s;upport life. Death, from this cau&s;e, is produced by the &s;ame mechanical means that the emi&s;&s;ion of &s;ound from a violin is prevented by the ab&s;traction of the bow from its &s;trings.</P>
<P N="2">2. By the exce&s;&s;ive force of &s;timuli of all kinds. No more occurs here than happens from too much
<PB N="76" REF="036255_0082_1008669248B850A8">
pre&s;&s;ure upon the &s;trings of a violin preventing its emitting mu&s;ical tones.</P>
<P N="3">3. By too much relaxation, or too weak a texture of the matter which compo&s;es the human body. No more occurs here than is ob&s;erved in the extinction of &s;ound by the total relaxation, or &s;lender combi|nation of the &s;trings of a violin.</P>
<P N="4">4. By an error in the place of certain fluid, or &s;olid parts of the body. No more occurs here, than would happen from fixing the &s;trings of a vio|lin upon its body, in&s;tead of elevating them upon its bridge.</P>
<P N="5">5. By the action of poi&s;onous exhalations, or of certain fluids vitiated in the body, upon parts which emit mo&s;t forcibly the motions of life. No more happens here than occurs from enveloping the &s;trings of a violin in a piece of wax.</P>
<P N="6">6. By the &s;olution of continuity by means of wounds in &s;olid parts of the body. No more occurs in death from this cau&s;e, than takes place when the emi&s;&s;ion of &s;ound from a violin is prevented by a rupture of its &s;trings.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="77" REF="036255_0083_10086693CB875EC8">
7. Death is produced by a preternatural rigidity, and in &s;ome in&s;tances by an o&s;&s;ification of the &s;olid parts of the body in old age; in con&s;equence of which they are incapable of receiving and emitting the motions of life. No more occurs here, than would happen if a &s;tick, or pipe-&s;tem were placed in the room of catgut, upon the bridges of the violin. But death may take place in old age with|out a change in the texture of animal matter, from the &s;timuli of life lo&s;ing their effect by repetition, ju&s;t as opium from the &s;ame cau&s;e, cea&s;es to pro|duce its u&s;ual effects upon the body.</P>
<P>Should it be a&s;ked, what is that peculiar organi|zation of matter, which enables it to emit life, when acted upon by &s;timuli, I an&s;wer, I do not know. The great Creator has kindly e&s;tabli&s;hed a witne&s;s of his un&s;earchable wi&s;dom in every part of his works, in order to prevent our forgetting him, in the &s;ucce&s;sful exerci&s;es of our rea&s;on. Mohammed once &s;aid "that he &s;hould believe him&s;elf to be a God, if he could bring down rain from the clouds, or give life to an animal." It belongs exclu&s;ively to the true God to endow matter with tho&s;e &s;ingu|lar properties, which enable it under certain circum|&s;tances, to exhibit the appearances of life.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="036255_0084_100866955D9AA4D0">
I cannot conclude this &s;ubject, without taking notice of its exten&s;ive application to medicine, me|taphy&s;ics, theology and morals.</P>
<P>The doctrine of animal life which has been taught, exhibits in the</P>
<P>Fir&s;t place, a new view of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, by di&s;covering its origin in the extremities of the nerves on which impre&s;&s;ions are made, and its termi|nation in the brain. This idea is extended in an ingenious manner by Mr. Valli in his treati&s;e upon animal electricity.</P>
<P N="2">2. It di&s;covers to us the true means of promoting health and longevity, by proportioning the num|ber and force of &s;timuli to the age, climate, &s;itua|tion, habits and temperament of the human body.</P>
<P N="3">3. It leads us to a knowledge of the cau&s;es of all di&s;ea&s;es. The&s;e con&s;i&s;t in exce&s;&s;ive, or preternatu|ral excitement in the whole, or a part of the human body, accompanied <HI>generally</HI> with irregular motions, and induced by natural, or artificial &s;timuli. The latter have been called very properly by Mr. Hun|ter <HI>irritants.</HI> The occa&s;ional ab&s;ence of motion in acute di&s;ea&s;es, is the effect only of the exce&s;s of impetus in their remote cau&s;es.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="79" REF="036255_0085_1008669988ED56E0">
4. It di&s;covers to us that the cure of all di&s;ea&s;es depends &s;imply upon the ab&s;traction of &s;timuli from the whole, or from a part of the body, when the motions excited by them, are in exce&s;s; and in the increa&s;e of their number and force, when motions are of a moderate nature. For the former pur|po&s;e, we employ a cla&s;s of medicines known by the name of &s;edatives. For the latter, we make u&s;e of &s;timulants. Under the&s;e two exten&s;ive heads, are included all the numerous articles of the Materia Medica.</P>
<P N="5">5. It enables us to reject the doctrine of innate ideas, and to a&s;cribe all our knowledge of &s;en&s;ible objects to impre&s;&s;ions acting upon an <HI>innate</HI> capacity to receive ideas. Were it po&s;&s;ible for a child to grow up to manhood without the u&s;e of any of its &s;en&s;es, it would not po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;ingle idea of a mate|rial object; and as all human knowledge is com|pounded of &s;imple ideas, this per&s;on would be as de&s;titute of knowledge of every kind, as the gro&s;&s;|e&s;t portion of vegetable, or fo&s;&s;il matter.</P>
<P N="6">6. The account which has been given of animal life, furni&s;hes a &s;triking illu&s;tration of the origin of human actions, by the impre&s;&s;ion of motives upon the will. As well might we admit an inherent principle of life in animal matter, as a &s;elf deter|mining
<PB N="80" REF="036255_0086_1008669BD12D1C28">
power in this faculty of the mind. Mo|tives are nece&s;&s;ary not only to con&s;titute its <HI>free|dom,</HI> but its <HI>e&s;&s;ence;</HI> for without them, there could be no more a will than there could be vi&s;ion with|out light, or hearing without &s;ound. It is true, they are often &s;o ob&s;cure as not to be perceived; and they &s;ometimes become in&s;en&s;ible from habit, but the &s;ame things have been remarked in the ope|ration of &s;timuli; and yet we do not upon this ac|count deny their agency in producing animal life. In thus deciding in favor of the nece&s;&s;ity of mo|tives, to produce actions, I cannot help bearing a te&s;timony again&s;t the gloomy mi&s;application of this doctrine by &s;ome modern writers. When proper|ly under&s;tood, it is calculated to produce the mo&s;t comfortable views of the divine government, and the mo&s;t beneficial effects upon morals, and human happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="7">7. There are errors of an impious nature, which &s;ometimes obtain a currency, from being di&s;gui&s;|ed by innocent names. The doctrine of animal life that has been delivered, is directly oppo&s;ed to an error of this kind, which has had the mo&s;t bane|ful influence upon morals and religion. To &s;up|po&s;e a principle to re&s;ide nece&s;&s;arily, and con&s;tant|ly in the human body, which acted independently of external circum&s;tances, is to a&s;cribe to it an at|tribute,

which I &s;hall not connect, even in lan|guage, with the creature man. Self exi&s;tence be|longs only to God.</P>
<P>The be&s;t criterion of the truth of a philo&s;ophical opinion, is its tendency to produce exalted ideas, of the Divine Being, and humble views of our&s;elves. The doctrine of animal life which has been deli|vered, is calculated to produce the&s;e effects in an eminent degree, for</P>
<P N="8">8. It does homage to the Supreme Being, as the governor of the univer&s;e, and e&s;tabli&s;hes the certain|ty of his univer&s;al, and particular providence. Ad|mit a principle of life in the human body, and we open a door for the re&s;toration of the old Epicure|an or athei&s;tical philo&s;ophy, which &s;uppo&s;ed the world to be governed by a principle called na|ture, and which was believed to be inherent in eve|ry kind of matter. The doctrine I have taught, cuts the &s;inews of this error; for by rendering the <HI>continuance</HI> of animal life, no le&s;s than its commence|ment, the effect of the con&s;tant operation of divine power and goodne&s;s, it leads us to believe that the whole creation is &s;upported in the &s;ame man|ner.</P>

9. The view that has been given of the depen|dent &s;tate of man for the ble&s;&s;ing of life, leads us to contemplate with very appo&s;ite and inexpre&s;&s;ible feelings, the &s;ublime idea which is given of the Deity in the &s;criptures, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing life "within him&s;elf." This divine prerogative has never been imparted but to one being, and that is, the Son of God. This appears from the following declara|tion. "For as the Father hath life in him&s;elf, &s;o hath he given to the Son to have life <HI>within him|&s;elf."</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John v. ver&s;e 26.</NOTE> To this plenitude of independent life, we are to a&s;cribe his being called the "life of the world," "the prince of life," and "life" it&s;elf, in the New Te&s;tament. The&s;e divine epithets which are very properly, founded upon the man|ner of our Saviour's exi&s;tence, exalt him infinite|ly above &s;imple humanity, and e&s;tabli&s;h his di|vine nature upon the ba&s;is of rea&s;on, as well as revelation.</P>
<P N="10">10. We have heard that &s;ome of the &s;timuli which produce animal life, are derived from the moral, and phy&s;ical evils of our world. From be|holding the&s;e in&s;truments of death thus converted by divine &s;kill into the means of life, we are led to believe goodne&s;s to be the &s;upreme attribute of the

Deity, and that it will appear finally to predomi|nate in all his works.</P>
<P N="11">11. The doctrine which has been delivered, is calculated to humble the pride of man; by teach|ing him his con&s;tant dependence upon his Maker for his exi&s;tence, and that he has no pre-eminence in his tenure of it, over the meane&s;t in&s;ect that flutters in the air, or the humble&s;t plant that grows upon the earth. What an in&s;pired writer &s;ays of the innumerable animals which inhabit the ocean, may with equal propriety be &s;aid of the whole hu|man race. "Thou &s;ende&s;t forth thy &s;pirit, and they are created. Thou take&s;t away their breath&mdash;they die, and return to their du&s;t."</P>
<P N="12">12. Melancholy indeed would have been the i&s;|&s;ue of all our inquiries, did we take a final leave of the human body in its &s;tate of decompo&s;ition in the grave. Revelation furni&s;hes us with an elevating, and comfortable a&s;&s;urance that this will not be the ca&s;e. The preci&s;e manner of its re-organization, and the new means of its future exi&s;tence, are unknown to us. It is &s;ufficient to believe, the event will take place, and that after it, the &s;oul and body of man will be exalted in one re&s;pect, to an equality with their Creator. They will be immortal.</P>

Here, gentlemen, we clo&s;e the hi&s;tory of animal life. I feel as if I had waded acro&s;s a rapid and dangerous &s;tream. Whether I have gained the op|po&s;ite &s;hore with my head clean, or covered with mud and weeds, I leave wholly to your determina|tion.</P>
