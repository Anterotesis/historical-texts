<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS the author has nothing to fear from the world, and as little to hope from it, he has not been very &s;olicitous about the public acceptance of the following pages. But as he &s;oberly thinks the &s;entiments con|tained in them to be true and important, he cannot but wi&s;h them to prevent his readers mi&s;taking him, which is the only rea&s;on he has for writing a pre|face. For this end it may be proper to inform the reader before hand, that the expre&s;&s;ion of di&s;gu&s;t again&s;t the pulpit in the title, and whatever like ex|pre&s;&s;ions may occur in the following pages, are by no means intended to &s;ignify that the office of a clergyman, or mini&s;ter of <HI>GOD</HI>'s word, is it&s;elf a proper &s;ubject of ridicule: but as &s;omebody &s;ays of kings, they have a divine right to rule <HI>well,</HI> but that will by no means infer that they have a divine right to be tyrants: &s;o we may &s;ay of the go&s;pel mini&s;try, that &s;uch as <HI>GOD</HI> has fitted for that &s;ervice, have a divine right to &s;peak the truth of <HI>GOD</HI> as they are able, but we cannot &s;ay they have a divine right to betray or corrupt it.</P>
<P>AS the author who&s;e performance gave occa&s;ion to the following thoughts does not, by the &s;tage, mean that frame of wood, &amp;c. on which the actors perform, but the performances thereon; &s;o the author of the following pages has no di&s;gu&s;t at the pulpit, but at the u&s;e commonly made of it.</P>
<P>IT cannot be denied, that the truth of the go&s;pel was propagated at the fir&s;t to the nations by preaching, and that it is &s;till the appointment of <HI>GOD</HI> for calling the attention of mankind to his divine grace, and for building up his people in that grace; but it is the pulpit being now generally u&s;ed in op|po&s;ition to that grace which bringeth &s;alvation, that is the dete&s;table thing herein cen&s;ured. The &s;corn that is ca&s;t on the clergy of all denominations, by infidels and libertines, is certainly very unju&s;t; as is every thing el&s;e that
<PB N="iv" REF="010852_0003_0F852363B3307630">
they &s;uffer from the mi&s;taken conceit that they are friends to the religion of <HI>JESUS CHRIST.</HI> If therefore the following e&s;&s;ay could but &s;erve to clear them of this charge, it might, by that means, reconcile to them the men of mo&s;t repute in the polite world for philo&s;ophy and enlarged &s;entiments.</P>
<P>NOR ought the author to be charged with &s;o much as the remote&s;t wi&s;h for any change in the national e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;ince he is &s;o well plea&s;ed with the pre&s;ent national church, as to be fully &s;atisfied it could never be &s;ucceeded by a better. If the pre&s;ent eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;erves the purpo&s;es of government, and is for the benefit of civil &s;ociety, (as &s;eems very evident) it is all we can have from any &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hment of religion: and as &s;ome religious precedency &s;eems ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in every &s;tate, &s;uch an e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, and &s;uch a toleration as we enjoy in this land, is all that any chri&s;tian can wi&s;h for. For he mu&s;t greatly mi&s;take the religion of <HI>JESUS CHRIST,</HI> who &s;hould think it was at all fit for a national church, or po&s;|&s;ible to be practi&s;ed by any whole nation of this world.</P>
<P>EVERY man mu&s;t &s;ee the truth of that propo&s;ition of Archbi&s;hop <HI>Til|lot&s;on</HI>'s (with whatever propriety his lord&s;hip could maintain it) that a na|tion of this world as &s;uch, can only be the &s;ubject of temporal promi&s;es and threatnings, as it is not, as a nation, capable of any other than temporal rewards and puni&s;hments. But all the promi&s;es and threatnings, all the rewards and puni&s;hments connected with the religion of <HI>JESUS CHRIST,</HI> are eternal; con&s;equently it cannot be a national religion.</P>
<P>ANY man that thinks it may, would do well to con&s;ider the laws given to <HI>CHRIST</HI>'s di&s;ciples, and try if he can think of any nation of this world being governed by them, &s;uch as, <HI>I &s;ay unto you, re&s;i&s;t not evil, &amp;c. Seek not ye what ye &s;hall eat, or what ye &s;hall drink, neither be ye of doubt|ful mind. For all the&s;e things do</HI> the nations of the world <HI>&s;eek after, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>AS all polite nations have found it nece&s;&s;ary to have an e&s;tabli&s;hed reli|gion, &s;o they have al&s;o thought it proper to admit and authorize &s;ome public entertainments and diver&s;ions.</P>
<P>IF the former &s;erves to promote loyalty to the &s;tate, good neighbourhood, and decency of character among the &s;ubjects, the&s;e are valuable effects, and all we ought to expect from it.</P>
<P>IF the latter &s;erve to poli&s;h our manners, and keep per&s;ons of lei&s;ure and di&s;&s;ipation out of wor&s;e mi&s;chiefs, they al&s;o have their u&s;e; for as a late

author &s;ays, "It is better for a man to &s;ee Sir John Brute acted on the &s;tage, than to act him him&s;elf in the &s;treet." Whether this benefit will coun|ter ballance its other mi&s;chiefs, is not for me to determine.</P>
<P>THIS is all the author has to &s;ay to &s;ave him&s;elf from the change of being an enemy to the clergy, the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, or any other body of people wearing the chri&s;tian name.</P>
<P>HE a&s;&s;ures the reader he is far from grudging them any honours or ad|vantages that they may obtain, only he would warn every one who may hap|pen to li&s;ten to him, not to tru&s;t them as &s;ure guides to heaven, left they too late find their mi&s;take.</P>
<P>THE character and &s;tation which the government allots the clergy in the church of England, and the per&s;onal excellencies of many of them of all de|nominations, demand our veneration and re&s;pect, and ought to &s;ecure them from that illiberal and low abu&s;e which has been very unju&s;tly ca&s;t upon the whole body. In &s;hort, the following pages do not reflect on the clergy for being clergy, but for corrupting the truth and mi&s;leading their followers. If they can be cleared of this blame, the author promi&s;es to confe&s;s his fault in blaming them, as publicly as he now brings the charge. As the reader would be very little the wi&s;er, and not at all the better, for knowing who wrote this pamphlet, the author has rea&s;on to think it be&s;t, for the pre&s;ent, to be</P>

<HEAD>ANOTHER High Road to Hell.</HEAD>
<P>A MAN who has learned his religion only from the bible, will not be frightned by any alarming thing that may be &s;aid of any of his ways, if the warning is un&s;upported by that &s;acred authority.</P>
<P>THE author of the pamphlet intitled, <HI>The &s;tage the high road to hell,</HI> &s;eems too much to have neglected this thought, having never produced one part of &s;cripture, in which the meer repre&s;enting the various cha|racters that are in the world is condemned. He may doubtle&s;s have very good rea&s;on for his apprehen&s;ions, that attendance on and delight in theatrical performances, is extreamly dangerous to the &s;ouls of men; and he had certainly a ju&s;t right to give warning of the dan|ger he &s;aw. It may indeed be que&s;tioned, whether &s;eeing the characters in real life, is not yet more dangerous than &s;eeing them repre&s;ented on the &s;tage; but as it is probable neither of us are di&s;po&s;ed for a cell or a hermitage, we may both do well to &s;hun the dangers we &s;ee, and fairly give our neighbours warning.</P>
<P>THE author of the following pages, without di&s;puting the mi&s;chiefs done by the &s;tage, or attempting to become an advocate for it, claims the &s;ame right to alarm the public with warning of another way to perdition, much more frequented and much le&s;s &s;u&s;pected, and there|fore more dangerous than that which the abovementioned author has de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>IF that author has proved that the &s;tage is u&s;ed in a way utterly
<PB N="7" REF="010852_0006_0F852365BA2C3640">
contrary to its pretence of &s;erving the cau&s;e of morality, &s;o the fol|lowing pages are intended to prove that the pulpit is u&s;ed in a manner quite as oppo&s;ite to any pretence it can have of &s;erving the cau&s;e of real chri&s;tianity. So that the conclu&s;ion will be, if there is any mo|rality among us, no thanks to the &s;tage for it; and if there is any chri&s;tianity among us, no thanks to the pulpit. It &s;hould &s;eem there|fore a very little occa&s;ion of grief to a chri&s;tian, although it be true, that "Many among us are of opinion, that theatrical amu&s;ements preclude the church, and render the preaching of its mini&s;ters unne|ce&s;&s;ary;" for this is no more to a chri&s;tian, than it would be to a mode&s;t man, &s;hould he be told that one hou&s;e of ill fame was getting the cu&s;tomers from another of equal or greater infamy. As the &s;tage is charged with recommending evil things under fair appearances, &s;o may the pulpit, with much greater aggravation as the greater pretence to &s;olemnity and piety can add to it. If performers on the &s;tage are to be blamed becau&s;e, "p. 4. <HI>they a&s;&s;ume a feigned character and utter &s;entiments to which the heart is a &s;tranger,</HI>" how much more dete&s;table mu&s;t <HI>&s;atan</HI>'s <HI>mini&s;ters</HI> be, when <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. xi. 14, 15.</NOTE> <HI>transformed as the mini&s;ters of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s!</HI> As to the moral characters either of preachers or players, it &s;eems better to drop all contention about them; for if preachers have been found fully as bad, in re&s;pect of moral character, as ever player was, the greater &s;hame and cen&s;ure will fall where the mo&s;t grave and &s;acred preten&s;ions were made. So, with this author's leave we will forget all the evil &s;tories he tells of wicked players, le&s;t fame &s;hould incline to compare them with many &s;trange &s;tories of naughty clergymen; and in&s;tead of in&s;i&s;ting on &s;uch compari&s;ons, let us only con&s;ider the evil tendency of their trades. I cannot fully agree with this author in grudging the players their gain, &s;eeing 'tis no ex|pence to any but &s;uch as chu&s;e it; no man is taxed for their main|tainance, as they are for the clergy. As this author a&s;&s;ures us, both at beginning and end of his performance, that his con&s;cience obliged him to bear this te&s;timony again&s;t &s;tage entertainments, we may well pre&s;ume, a man &s;o con&s;cientious will readily agree to an appeal to the &s;criptures, for a determination of any que&s;tion about what ways lead men to perdition, although he has not him&s;elf made much u&s;e of them for this end.</P>
<P>IF he had been much acquainted with his bible, it might have cool|led his zeal for the honour of <HI>black cloth,</HI> and have reconciled him to
<PB N="8" REF="010852_0007_0F85236660F633B0">
the expo&s;ing the clergy as well as other men who may act ridicu|lou&s;ly and wickedly, to the contempt they de&s;erve; whether by plays or any other way. And it might have &s;hewed him too, that however foreign &s;tage-entertainments may be from the go&s;pel, or however op|po&s;ite to it, yet that the doctrine and honour of the clergy are no le&s;s foreign or oppo&s;ite: at lea&s;t a better recollection of the bible might have &s;aved him from the mi&s;take of attributing tho&s;e words to <HI>Solomon,</HI> p. 4. Ded. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jeremiah xvii. 9.</NOTE> <HI>The heart is deceitful above all things and de&s;perately wicked.</HI> And I the rather take notice of this little mi&s;take, becau&s;e if the author had regarded the important connection of tho&s;e words as they &s;tand in the prophet Jeremiah, chap. xvil. 5&mdash;9, it might perhaps have &s;omewhat abated his devout confidence in the leaders of religion. <HI>Cur&s;ed be the man that tru&s;teth in man,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>COULD a man, believing the &s;cripture account of the Son of GOD, quote with &s;uch full approbation that celebrated &s;aying of Plato, as this author is plea&s;ed to give it us:
<Q>If virtue was to appear in its native beauty to mankind, its charms would, with irre&s;i&s;table force, captivate all hearts?</Q>
Did not virtue appear in its native beauty to mankind, when the Son of GOD went about on earth doing good? But did the charms of virtue made vi&s;ible in him, captivate all hearts? A man that has not learning enough to be the wi&s;er for any thing that Plato or Seneca have &s;aid, may clearly &s;ee that this zeal for virtue is a very different thing from delight in the perfectly virtuous character of the Son of GOD; and that it may &s;ub&s;i&s;t without any inclination to imitate that character.</P>
<P>THE following pages go wholly on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the word of GOD, by which we mu&s;t be judged at the la&s;t day, is alone &s;ufficient to point out to us the danger of all the various ways in which men go down to de&s;truction. 'Tis only by this word that the perni|cious nature, and damnable tendency of the modern pulpit-entertain|ments can be di&s;covered. And if that word does not warrant all that fol|lows, it will be in vain for the author to talk of good meanings and pious wi&s;hes. It is regard to the doctrines and commandments of men, that makes the word of GOD of none effect, and leads men to &s;train at goats and &s;wallow camels; and if the author above refer'd to &s;hould appear to be doing &s;o, he is far from being &s;ingular. But if the religion of JESUS CHRIST, as preached by him and his apo&s;tles, be permitted to
<PB N="9" REF="010852_0008_0F8523672A550558">
determine which is the broad way that leadeth to de&s;truction, and which the narrow way that leadeth to life eternal, we may come to find no le&s;s occa&s;ion to &s;ound the alarm to the preachers and their fol|lowers, than to comedians and their admirers. And, however &s;trange it is, the purpo&s;e of the following pages is to &s;hew, that the danger of the <HI>devout way</HI> to perdition is by far the greate&s;t, becau&s;e mo&s;t trod|den, and lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected. Whether this is true or no is &s;u&s;pended on the proof of the following propo&s;itions.</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT there is a devout as well as a profane way to eternal pedition.</P>
<P N="2">2 THE pre&s;ent pulpit-entertainments in general lead men in this way.</P>
<P>IF the &s;criptures keep us in countenance in maintaining the&s;e pro|po&s;itions, we &s;hall not be fatally put to the blu&s;h, although we &s;hould neither plea&s;e men di&s;tingui&s;hed by their piety, nor yet the advocates for tho&s;e amu&s;ements at which devout people make wry faces. Nor indeed can we at all expect to plea&s;e either.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THAT there is a devout way of going to hell</HI> cannot be doubted, if the new-te&s;tament is to determine upon it, &s;o long as CHRIST's ac|count of the Phari&s;ees is to be found there: for they are po&s;itively declared to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxiii. 15.</NOTE> be the children of hell, and in a way that <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxiil. 33.</NOTE> could not e&s;cape damnation. He who knew what was in man, te&s;tified of them that <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">John viii. 44.</NOTE> <HI>They were of their father the devil, and would do his works:</HI> and he &s;carce pronounced a woe on any of the &s;ons of men in which they were chiefly intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>BUT I need not take pains to prove that the&s;e ancient people found a devout way to hell, for it is of no importance to us, if we are in no danger of going the &s;ame road. Whether therefore we are in any danger of taking that for the way to heaven in which they went down to hell, may de&s;erve a &s;ober inquiry. And we cannot do this without con&s;idering their way, and di&s;covering how &s;o plau&s;ible a path came to have &s;o fatal an end. That they were hypocrites, is true, but then this was &s;een by none but by him who knew their
<PB N="10" REF="010852_0009_0F852367DFF388F0">
hearts; for their conduct and appearance <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xvi. 15.</NOTE> ju&s;tified them <HI>before men,</HI> and they <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxiii. 28.</NOTE> <HI>outwardly appeared righteous to men</HI>; which they could not have done if they had not appeared to be <HI>&s;incere, hone&s;t, &s;ober, cha&s;te,</HI> and in &s;ome ca&s;es <HI>bountiful</HI> to the di&s;tre&s;s'd, as well as <HI>fervent in their devotions.</HI> No man could appear to be righteous among any people, wanting the appearance of any of the&s;e.</P>
<P>THAT the Phari&s;ee is repre&s;ented as exalting him&s;elf in his prayers <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke xviii. 10, 14.</NOTE> is true, but he is charged with lying before his Maker when he &s;ays, "<HI>I am not as other men are, extortioners, unju&s;t, adulterers, or even as this publican. I fa&s;t twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I po&s;&s;e&s;s:</HI> &s;o that we are &s;till allowed to think what he &s;aid of him&s;elf was true. Their knowledge about religious matters was &s;o highly e&s;teemed, as that their judgment about CHRIST was thought &s;ufficient to be op|po&s;ed to the evidence that attended his miracles, and the unavoidable conclu&s;ion again&s;t him is hinted by their &s;aying, <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">John vii. 48.</NOTE> <HI>Have any of the rulers or of the Phari&s;ees believed?</HI> Their zeal for the divine law, lead them to be very &s;crupulous of any approach towards a breach of it; therefore they gave tithes of all that they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, even mint, anni&s;e, and cummin, and all herbs. They ob&s;erved CHRIST's di&s;ciples rub|bing ears of corn in their hands on the &s;abbath, and were offended; they de&s;ired the people that needed healing to come on other days and be healed, and not on the &s;abbath; &s;o that they were a kind of SO|CIETY FOR REFORMATION OF MANNERS. And then, &s;o &s;olicitous were they that men of other nations might enjoy the divine law with them, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxiii. 15.</NOTE> that they <HI>compa&s;&s;ed &s;ea and land to make a pro&s;elyte</HI> from the hea|then nations.</P>
<P>THIS &s;hort &s;ketch of the Phari&s;ees character (which might have been much enlarged) &s;hews, that as far as men can &s;ee of one another, they had a good title to the place they held as fir&s;t rate examples of human righteou&s;ne&s;s. And this JESUS &s;eems to allow when (he being about to &s;hew how much farther the divine law extended than either his di&s;ciples or the Jews thought) he &s;aid to his di&s;ciples, <NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. v. 20.</NOTE> <HI>Except your righteou&s;ne&s;s exceed the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, ye &s;hall in no ca&s;e enter into the kingdom of heaven,</HI> which is plainly &s;aying, they are going devoutly to hell. Nor can we think that Saul of <HI>Tar&s;us</HI> was &s;ingular among them when, <HI>touching the righteou&s;ne&s;s that is of the
<PB N="11" REF="010852_0010_0F85236AD22007A8">
law</HI> (as they and he under&s;tood it) <HI>he was blamele&s;s.</HI> Or that the, were le&s;s per&s;waded of being right, or le&s;s &s;incere than he was, when he VERILY THOUGHT <HI>he</HI> OUGHT <HI>to do many things contrary to the name of</HI> JESUS <HI>of Nazareth.</HI> Accordingly they were as forward to claim a peculiar relation to GOD as any under the chri&s;tian name can be, and &s;aid, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John viii. 41.</NOTE> <HI>We have one father even</HI> GOD. And to this they had the &s;anction of all that were e&s;teemed for &s;tation in the church, or for wi&s;dom and piety, &s;o that we cannot expect to &s;ee them outdone, either in their real character for piety and devotion, their attainments in wi&s;dom and righteou&s;ne&s;s, or their confident claims on the peculiar favour of GOD. To per&s;ons thus di&s;tingui&s;hed from the common herd of mankind, it mu&s;t be always very provoking to hear JESUS &s;ay, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxi. 31.</NOTE> <HI>Publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of</HI> GOD <HI>before you.</HI> Or yet more &s;everely, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxiii. 23,</NOTE> <HI>Ye &s;erpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye e&s;cape the damnation of hell?</HI> And in an&s;wer to their peculiar claim of being the children of GOD; to hear him &s;ay, <HI>Ye are of your father, the devil, and his works ye will do.</HI> The&s;e &s;ayings and many more that might be mentioned fully prove one propo&s;ition: there is a devout way to hell.</P>
<P>AND we are as clearly told how this happened. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Luke xviii. 9.</NOTE> <HI>They tru&s;ted in them&s;elves that they were righteous, and de&s;pi&s;ed others.</HI> And this is the &s;ame account as Paul gives of the matter when he &s;ays, <HI>I bear them record that they have a zeal of</HI> GOD, <HI>but not according to knowledge. For they being ignorant of</HI> GOD<HI>'s righteou&s;ne&s;s, and going about to e&s;tabli&s;h their own righteou&s;ne&s;s, have not &s;ubmitted them&s;elves to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of</HI> GOD. This warrants us to &s;ay with the greate&s;t confidence, that all devout people, however di&s;tingui&s;hed by the chri&s;tian name, if they are tru&s;ting in them&s;elves that they are righteous, and going about to e&s;tabli&s;h their own righteou&s;ne&s;s, are following them to perdition in the &s;ame devout way. This makes our way clear to the</P>
<P N="2">2d Propo&s;ition. <HI>The pre&s;ent pulpit-entertainments in general lead men in this way.</HI></P>
<P>THE proof of this depends upon the evidence that &s;hall be produced of their leading men to tru&s;t in them&s;elves that they are righteous. 'Tis plain the Phari&s;ees did not think them&s;elves <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> &s;inle&s;s, but comparatively &s;o, as being much nearer to the kingdom of heaven than
<PB N="12" REF="010852_0011_0F85236B860ACC78">
publicans and harlots: but they never meant to deny that they had human infirmities and failings, el&s;e why did they fa&s;t twice in the week, if they had no &s;in to confe&s;s?</P>
<P>AND indeed we find them not free of &s;u&s;picion le&s;t they were &s;till deficient, and all was not quite right with them: one of them enquires of CHRIST, <HI>What good thing &s;hall I do that I may inherit eternal life? I have kept all the commandments, what lack I yet?</HI> So that the&s;e as well as modern devout people had their doubts and fears le&s;t they were not quite meet for eternal life. We may al&s;o ob&s;erve, that they a&s;|cribed all the difference between them and others to a work of divine grace, and &s;aid, GOD <HI>I thank thee</HI> that I am not as other men are. Nay after all they &s;eem jealous that the whole law is too exten&s;ive for them; and therefore they wanted to find what was the <HI>main</HI> thing in religion, that if they &s;hould be found wanting in &s;ome circum&s;tantials, yet they might be right in the main, being found in fundamentals, and having the root of the matter in them: therefore one of them a&s;keth of JESUS, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxii. 36.</NOTE> Ma&s;ter, which is the great commandment in the law? Their great mi&s;take was no more than this: they thought GOD would regard and accept them on account of that difference which him&s;elf had made between them and others, by implanting in them a principle of grace leading them to avoid &s;in, and regard his law.</P>
<P>THE parallel between the&s;e, and the bulk of devout people in our day, would be too obvious to need any more words about it, were it not that the modern Phari&s;ees confe&s;s CHRIST in words, and &s;ay much about &s;alvation by him; whereas tho&s;e ancient Phari&s;ees called him a bla&s;phemer, and crucified him as &s;uch. In order therefore to prove that the modern doctrine of the pulpit leads men to the &s;ame awful end, in the &s;ame pernicious way, as that in which the Jews <HI>&s;tumbled, and fell, and were broken, and &s;nared, and taken;</HI> we mu&s;t prove that it is for &s;ub&s;tance the &s;ame as theirs. And if this doctrine be found to be parallel with the doctrine of tho&s;e who tru&s;ted in them&s;elves that they were righteous, and de&s;pi&s;ed others, the conclu&s;ion mu&s;t be, that whatever they pretend, they believe not the record that GOD hath given of his Son; and <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mark xvi. 16.</NOTE> <HI>He that believeth not &s;hall be damned.</HI> As the great mi&s;take both of ancient and modern Phari&s;ees is concerning ac|ceptance with GOD, and a title to his favour, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate the &s;criptural account of it, and compare the modern doctrine therewith.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="010852_0012_0F85236BA07668D8">THE &s;criptural account of this matter is, that GOD found <HI>none righteous, no, not one</HI> among the &s;ons of men; and that he pronounced a cur&s;e on them all, becau&s;e they had <HI>not continued in all things written in his law to do them.</HI> But that, &s;eeing the truth of GOD, declared in his law, could not be maintained, and &s;in again&s;t that law pa&s;s unpu|ni&s;hed, he was plea&s;ed to lay on his beloved Son the iniquities of all with whom he partook in fle&s;h and blood, that he might deliver them <HI>from the cur&s;e of the law, being made a cur&s;e for them.</HI> When he had fully honoured the law by obeying it, and bearing the cur&s;e of it in|&s;tead of the guilty, he ro&s;e from the dead, as the a&s;&s;urance that his work was perfect, and his offering for &s;in accepted. As GOD declared him&s;elf well plea&s;ed in his offering for &s;in, and has put it out of all doubt by his rai&s;ing him from the dead, we can have a <HI>lively hope</HI> of the eternal <HI>inheritance</HI> no other way but <HI>by his re&s;urrection from the dead;</HI> for he hath made us accepted no other way but <HI>in the beloved.</HI> Nothing therefore ought (and nothing but &s;ome de&s;tructive lie can) deliver us from the fear of the cur&s;e of GOD's law, but his being <HI>made a cur&s;e</HI> for &s;inners, <HI>and rai&s;ed again for their ju&s;tification.</HI> This was all he pro|po&s;ed to his &s;ervant John when &s;uffering bani&s;hment for his &s;ake, and when dying with fear at the &s;ight of his LORD; <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. i. 17, 18.</NOTE> <HI>Fear not, I am the fir&s;t and the la&s;t: I am he that liveth and was dead; and behold I am alive for evermore, amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.</HI> This then is the great point to be kept in view in trying the &s;pirits whether they are of GOD, viz. from what ari&s;es their hope of GOD's favour, or, what is the rea&s;on they give that men may not de&s;pair, when, con&s;cious of &s;in, they think of &s;tanding before GOD in judgment. The rea&s;on of their hope mu&s;t be, either what they them&s;elves are di&s;tinction from tho&s;e who peri&s;h; or el&s;e it mu&s;t be, the work of the Son of GOD. The former was the Phari&s;ees hope; the latter is the rea&s;on of hope among CHRIST's di&s;ciples.

In com|paring the modern doctrines with, and trying them by the divine rule, I &s;hall take the liberty to repre&s;ent them in my own words, that I may &s;ave my&s;elf and my readers the labour of large and numerous quotati|ons. In doing this I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to this &s;ingle, but the mo&s;t Important point, viz. to &s;hew how the modern <HI>mini&s;ters of religion</HI> en|courage their followers to hope for eternal life.</P>
<P>BY &s;ome we are told, that a <HI>&s;ober, virtuous, well-&s;pent life, is the be&s;t preparative for death; and that con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of this has been a cordial to the heart of many a well di&s;po&s;ed chri&s;tian, when going out of this world.</HI> They a&s;&s;ure us that <HI>con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of integrity, and ju&s;t intention in life and action, may make a man &s;urvey his pa&s;t life without di&s;may, although &s;ome frailties may be found about him which &s;erve to &s;hew that he was but a man, and in re&s;pect of tho&s;e he may hope for mercy.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE only to ob&s;erve on this &s;ource of hope, that if a man has not &s;inned, <HI>he &s;hall &s;urely live, he &s;hall not die.</HI> If he has &s;inned, <HI>his righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall not profit him</HI>: he is under the cur&s;e which GOD has unalterably pronounced <HI>on &s;uch as continue not in all things written in the book of the law to do them</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 19.</NOTE>: &s;o there is no difference between him and others, for all have &s;inned and come &s;hort of the glory of GOD.

For this doctrine &s;tands thus: The virtuous man, although not free from &s;in, hath a hope of eternal life, &s;uch as the vicious man hath no foundation for, and ought not to entertain. But why not? if GOD will be plea&s;ed with le&s;s than per|fect righteou&s;ne&s;s, who told them that he will not be plea&s;ed without

any at all? The law requires perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s; who hath altered it? or rather who hath di&s;graced it, as not <HI>holy, ju&s;t and good?</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 19.</NOTE> <HI>Now we know that what&s;oever the law &s;eith, it &s;aith to them that are under the law: that every mouth may be &s;topped, and all the world may become guil|ty before</HI> GOD. This pretence of virtue is one of the ways in which, men, called chri&s;tians, tru&s;t in them&s;elves that they are righteous; but it may be doubted whether the&s;e men of virtue and piety are &s;o ortho|dox as to thank GOD that they are not as other men are.</P>
<P>OTHERS, who &s;ay le&s;s about virtue and piety as the rea&s;on of hope and do not boa&s;t of the &s;upreme energy of the&s;e to make mens peace with GOD, tell us, <HI>if we &s;incerely repent and unfeignedly believe the holy go&s;pel,</HI> we may entertain &s;uch hopes as the unbelievers and impenitent are &s;trangers to, and ought not to entertain. Now this way of talk|ing may <HI>&s;eem</HI> to have as many &s;criptures for it as there are importing that he that believes in JESUS CHRIST is ju&s;tified by him. Yet if we examine it, we may find that it hinges all the hope of a &s;inner on the <HI>&s;incerity</HI> of his faith and repentance, as much as, in the former ca&s;e, it is hinged on piety and virtue. If I unfeignedly believe, &amp;c. I may hope. But this is a go&s;pel that will give me no hope, till I can prove (or at lea&s;t get a good conceit of) my own &s;incerity. And when I get this hope, what is the foundation of it, but a tru&s;t in my&s;elf that I am righteous, &s;o far as &s;incerity is righteou&s;ne&s;s? And thus my hope depends on that by which I am di&s;tingui&s;hed from in|fidels and hypocrites. It is true, every &s;incere penitent, and unfeigned believer of CHRIST's words, has good hope; but then his hope does not ari&s;e from any a&s;&s;urance of his own &s;incerity, but from what the truth which he believes, te&s;tifies, about the &s;incerity of CHRIST's heart and the perfection of his work. The hope that ari&s;es from our &s;incerity in any thing, is certainly a very different hope from that which comes by hearing CHRIST &s;ay, <HI>Fear not, I am he that liveth and was dead,</HI> &amp;c. This truth, believed in the heart, may and will produce a joy that is un&s;peakable and full of glory; while yet the man who believes it, is far from finding, or wi&s;hing to find, as a &s;ource of hope, any rea&s;on to vouch for the &s;incerity of his heart, which, this very truth gives him to know, is <HI>deceitful above all things, and de&s;pe|rately wicked.</HI> It is becau&s;e this &s;incerity is a thing not &s;o ea&s;ily proved, that chri&s;tians, after they have profe&s;&s;ed faith and repentance, are exhorted to <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. xiii. 5.</NOTE> <HI>examine them&s;elves, whether they be in the faith, and
<PB N="16" REF="010852_0015_0F85236DE49FDEA8">
to prove them&s;elves,</HI> &amp;c. We are therefore confident to &s;ay, let the faith about which men are &s;uppo&s;ed to be unfeignedly employed, be expre&s;&s;ed never &s;o &s;cripturally, and believed never &s;o &s;incerely, yet it is not the faith of GOD's elect, if the hope it gives does not ari&s;e wholly from the truth they believe, exclu&s;ive of any dependance on the &s;incerity of their belief. Nothing is more common than for men to take it for granted that their faith is unfeigned, and their repentance &s;incere; and yet it is al&s;o very common to &s;ee the hypocri&s;y of both expo&s;ed in the lives of tho&s;e who are thus flattering them&s;elves. We mu&s;t therefore conclude, that the go&s;pel affords a rea&s;on of hope and joy to <HI>&s;inners,</HI> without any occa|&s;ion for a conceit of their own &s;incerity to encourage their hope: and that our faith can never be proved to be unfeigned, but by its having the &s;ame effects as it u&s;ed to have in all &s;uch who knew the grace of GOD in truth. GOD purifies the hearts of men by the faith; and it is only faith working by love to CHRIST's name, that can prove it to be unfeigned; and that our hope and joy are not tho&s;e of the hypocrite. Now that <HI>hope</HI> of eternal life mu&s;t be fal&s;e and de|&s;tructive, which is not founded on that which gives a <HI>title</HI> to eternal life. Our defective &s;incerity does not give a title to eternal life, el&s;e is CHRIST dead in vain: therefore hope derived from it is only a hope which &s;hall peri&s;h, like the hope of the hypocrite. And all the pul|pits u&s;ed for promoting this hope which will make a&s;hamed, are &s;o many in&s;tances of the pulpit being a way to hell.</P>
<P>BUT all this cen&s;ure on the bu&s;tle men make about &s;incerity will be granted, and the advocates for that doctrine de&s;pi&s;ed as legali&s;ts, or &s;ome other name out of repute among&s;t orthodox people; and all this, by &s;uch as differ from them only in their taking a wider circuit, to come at la&s;t into the &s;ame road. The difference is, that in&s;tead of calling their idol <HI>&s;incerity,</HI> they chu&s;e to call it <HI>grace, experience,</HI> or the <HI>new-creature,</HI> the better to di&s;gui&s;e their deceit and &s;ecure their party. We may the better under&s;tand the&s;e deceivers by attending to their way of &s;peaking comfort to their followers, when dejected with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt and fear of divine wrath.

into the &s;ame road as the re&s;t, and without troubling them&s;elves or their hearers about regeneration or experience, a&s;&s;ure them and urge them to believe that GOD hath made a grant of CHRIST and all his benefits to all mankind, &s;o as to give &s;ufficient ground for any man to appropriate them to him&s;elf&punc; and &s;ay without re&s;erve or he&s;itation, CHRIST loved <HI>me</HI> and gave him&s;elf for <HI>me,</HI> &s;o that I &s;hall never peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life. And if this appropriation be warranted in the word of GOD, the ab&s;olute a&s;&s;urance of eternal life mu&s;t certainly be in&s;eparably connected with it. But what is the ground of the hope that comes this way? If CHRIST gave him&s;elf for all the human race, and &s;o for me among the re&s;t, I can have no a&s;&s;urance from thence, of my &s;alvation, without being a&s;&s;ured at the &s;ame time that the whole human race &s;hall be &s;aved. If my hope depends on being a&s;&s;ured that he gave him&s;elf for <HI>me,</HI> in a &s;en&s;e in which he did not give him&s;elf for them that peri&s;h, on what evidence peculiar to me does this a&s;&s;urance of his having died for <HI>me,</HI> as he did not for them that peri&s;h, depend? Or in other words, as there is no mention or de&s;cription of me in par|ticular, in the &s;cripture account of CHRIST's death, what is there about me to a&s;&s;ure me that he died for me? The an&s;wer can only be, becau&s;e I have been enabled to appropriate CHRIST and all his benefits to my&s;elf, which tho&s;e others have not been ena|bled to do. Thus the hope of eternal life does not ari&s;e &s;olely from what CHRIST has done, but in part at lea&s;t on what I have been enabled to do, and by doing it, to di&s;tingui&s;h my&s;elf from others. Nay &s;o important is this appropriating act, that all that which CHRIST has done can be no comfort to me without it! Now if I might be per|mitted, with proper deference to my &s;uperiors, I would expo&s;tulate a little with all the&s;e different parties, and &s;ay, Why all this difference and ani|mo&s;ity among people that are really agreed in the main? For &s;urely that which can hope to a &s;inner before his Maker, mu&s;t be the main thing in religion. As all are agreed that is a good di&s;po&s;ition of mind brought forth into act and exerci&s;e that gives hope, why &s;hould they di&s;agree about the name they call it by? If one calls it the <HI>habits of virtue and piety:</HI> another calls it <HI>&s;incere repentance and unfeigned faith:</HI> another, <HI>the change wrought in man by the &s;pirit of</HI> GOD <HI>implanting a principle of grace in him:</HI> and another calls it, <HI>the act of appropriation:</HI> why &s;hould they differ about words and names, &s;eeing they might even exchange names with each other without injuring the main thing in any of their &s;y&s;tems at all? But whether the&s;e things can be compromi&s;ed or not, matters little to any lover of the go&s;pel which CHRIST and his apo&s;tles preached, for neither party have any thing to do with that

go&s;pel but to corrupt it. After all that has been &s;aid, it will be no &s;urprize to the reader to be told that modern chri&s;tianity is a very dif|ferent religion from that which JESUS CHRIST and his apo&s;tles taught. That it differs from it in that which is the main thing in any religion; even, what it is that can give hope to a dying &s;inner, who is to be eternally happy or mi&s;erable. If it &s;hould be enquired, where may that religion be &s;een which CHRIST and his apo&s;tles taught? The an&s;wer is, In the bible, and no where in any other form than it appears in there.

<P>FAIRLY to examine the various modern preten&s;ions to chri&s;tianity, we mu&s;t compare the effects of it in the lives of its profe&s;&s;ors, with the effects produced in the beginning among them that believed and knew the grace of GOD in truth.

<P>THIS is a rule by which CHRIST taught his di&s;ciples to detect fal&s;e teachers. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. vii. 15, 20.</NOTE> <HI>Beware of fal&s;e prophets, which come to you in &s;heep's cloathing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye &s;hall know them by their fruits: do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thi&s;tles? Even &s;o every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit: neither can a cor|rupt tree bring forth good fruit. Wherefore by their fruit ye &s;hall know them.</HI> By this divine rule we ought to judge and to be judged. And whenever we &s;ee among profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity, a ravening after riches, honour, e&s;teem, influence, or any other thing contrary to the humble and &s;elf-denying character of the Son of GOD, we can be at no lo&s;s to know what is hidden under the &s;heep's cloathing. If we &s;ee real chri&s;tianity, we &s;hall find a people, although <HI>in a great trial of affliction and deep poverty, abounding in the riches of their liberality</HI>; and e&s;teeming this only to be <HI>pure and undefiled religion before</HI> GOD <HI>and the Father, to vi&s;it the fatherle&s;s and the widow in their affliction, and to keep them&s;elves un&s;potted from the world:</HI> and e&s;teeming that an im|pure and corrupt religion that teaches men apologies for the neglect of this. But if we look on modern chri&s;tianity we &s;ee clergymen, of every &s;ort and &s;ect, courting applau&s;e and popularity, maintaining
<PB N="21" REF="010852_0020_0F852375807BCF50">
their clerical dignity and pretence to amba&s;&s;ador&s;hip, enlarging their incomes by every mean in their power, laying up trea&s;ures to aggran|dize their families, indulging in voluptuou&s;ne&s;s and expen&s;ive living, while the poor &s;tarve for food and have no covering from the cold. Thus did not CHRIST. Thus do not chri&s;tians. <HI>By their fruits ye &s;hall know them</HI> for, <HI>he that &s;aith he abideth in</HI> CHRIST, <HI>ought him&s;elf al&s;o &s;o to walk, even as he walked</HI> Every one mu&s;t &s;ee how ea&s;y it would be to draw the contra&s;t between ancient and modern chri&s;ti|anity to a great length; but this &s;pecimen may &s;uffice to &s;hew, that we cannot call the chri&s;tianity commonly profe&s;&s;ed in Europe, under various forms, the religion taught by JESUS CHRIST; without putting darkne&s;s for light, and light for darkne&s;s, calling evil good, and good evil. If it appears that the modern doctrine of the pulpits, although diver&s;ified enough to be named <HI>legion,</HI> is calculated to pro|mote a delu&s;ive, and de&s;tructive hope, and that the teachers and abettors of &s;uch doctrine are al&s;o the example of an impure and cor|rupt religion, that does not teach its votaries, and influence them, to deny all ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, and to live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly, in this pre&s;ent world, we mu&s;t conclude and maintain that we have proved, that the pulpit has abundantly more right than the &s;tage, to be called the high way to hell.</P>
<P>PRESUMING on this I &s;hall conclude with a paragraph borrowed and a little varied from the &s;evere reflection on players in <HI>The &s;tage the high road to hell</HI> Only think of preachers in&s;tead of &s;tage-players, and the paragraph will run thus.
<Q>What mu&s;t we think of men who make it their whole bu&s;ine&s;s to draw in deluded mortals, to a de|ceiving hope of eternal life, by di&s;gui&s;ing the truth, with all the deceitful arts and allurements which their genius and intere&s;t can &s;ugge&s;t! May they not be con&s;idered as Daemons in a human &s;hape, who thus pur&s;ue the &s;ame end as the fir&s;t deceiver? Are they not the wor&s;t enemies of mankind? Tho&s;e &s;urely who debauch the con&s;ciences of their fellow-creatures are their wor&s;t enemies, and mu&s;t be deemed by all that fear GOD, greater de&s;troyers than mur|derers and highway robbers; for what are life and property if weighed in a balance with eternal &s;alvation? Or what is the guilt of tho&s;e who de&s;troy the body only, when compared with the heinou&s;ne&s;s of their guilt who deceive our &s;ouls, by leading us to tru&s;t in that which cannot &s;ave us from the wrath of him who is able to de&s;troy both &s;oul and body in hell?</Q></P>
