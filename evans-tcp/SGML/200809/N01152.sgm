<HEAD>The Preface.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE that have been Eminent Refor|mers in the Church of God, have &s;eldom or never been &s;o happy, as to Effect a perfect Reformation. <HI>A&s;a</HI> reformed ma|ny things, <HI>But the high places were not taken away,</HI> 2 Chron. 15. 17. And tho' it is &s;aid of <HI>Jeho&s;haphat.</HI> that <HI>he took away the high places out of Ju|dah,</HI> 2 Chron. 17. 6. Yet, <HI>Chap.</HI> 20. <HI>v.</HI> 33 it is noted, that in the latter end of his Reign, <HI>That the high places were not taken away:</HI> the meaning is, that he did take them away in part, yet did not perfectly effect it. Corruption is wont to creep upon the Church by degrees, and Reformation is not effected at once. Sometimes when tho&s;e things that are more gro&s;s are taken away, &s;ome le&s;&s;er Corruptions are retain|ed: and &s;ometimes when men go from one extream, they don't &s;top where they &s;hould, but tre&s;pa&s;s on the other hand. This comes to pa&s;s, partly through the dim-&s;ighredne&s;s of men: when many Corrupti|ons are grown up in the Church, it mu&s;t be a work of Time to make a di&s;covery of them; tho&s;e that di&s;cern &s;ome, are not &s;u&s;picious of others; when the Church is much corrupted, it is a time of darkne&s;s, and Errors do not lye open to Ob&s;ervation. Partly it comes to pa&s;s through the perver&s;ne&s;s, and &s;tub|borne&s;s of People, who are backward to turn out of tho&s;e ways that they have been naturalized unto: that is given as the rea&s;on why the High places were not taken away, becau&s;e <HI>the People had not prepared their heart to the Lord God of their Fathers,</HI> 2 Chron. 20. 22.</P>
<P><PB REF="001372_0003_0FB292C8548D98C0">
There have been three remarkeable In&s;tances in the&s;e later Ages of the imperfect accompli&s;hment of the work of Reformation.</P>
<P><HI>Lucher</HI> was an in&s;trument in the hand of God to open a door of deliverance from <HI>Popery:</HI> and he did with abundance of Evidence, make a di&s;covery of a Multitude of Abominations in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> yet was &s;o unhappy as to fall into that corrupt Opini|on of <HI>Con&s;ub&s;tantiation.</HI></P>
<P>The glorious Reformers of our Nation in the dayes of K. <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth, went beyond <HI>Luther</HI> in the work of Reformation, and yet even that glorious Re|formation was very imperfect, and wanting in many things to be mended by the Church in Succeeding Ages: And tho&s;e holy men who fir&s;t planted this Land, carryed on the work of Reformation to an higher pitch, yet failed in &s;everal things; e&s;pecially in two points, <HI>viz.</HI> in not accepting Non-&s;candalous Per&s;ons into their Communion; and in not acknow|ledging a Publick Government in the Church.</P>
<P>And &s;uch is the mi&s;ery of the Church of God that the mi&s;takes of tho&s;e worthy men, who have led in the work of Reformation, do prove an invincible temptation to many men. As the Renown of tho&s;e Reformers is a bulwark again&s;t tho&s;e Errors that were Exploded by them, &s;o we find our &s;elves embarra&s;&s;ed by their mi&s;takes from proceeding in the work of Reformation: As if it were criminal not to mi&s;take with them.</P>
<P>It may po&s;&s;ibly be a fault and an aggravation of a fault, to depart from the ways of our Fathers; but it may al&s;o be a vertue, and an eminent act of Obedi|ence to depart from them in &s;ome things. Men are wont to make a great noi&s;e, that we are bringing in of Innovations, and depart from the Old Way: But it is beyond me to find out wherein the iniquity does
<PB REF="001372_0004_0FB292C9D46786A8">lye. We may &s;ee cau&s;e to alter &s;ome practi&s;es of our Fathers, without de&s;pi&s;ing of them, without priding our &s;elves in our own Wi&s;dom, without Apo&s;tacy, without abu&s;ing the advantages that God has given us, without a &s;pirit of compliance with corrupt men, without inclinations to Super&s;tition, without making di&s;turbance in the Church of God: And there is no rea&s;on that it &s;hould be turned as a reproach upon us.</P>
<P>Surely it is commendable for us to Examine the practi&s;es of our Fathers; we have no &s;ufficient rea&s;on to take practi&s;es upon tru&s;t from them: let them have as high a character as belongs to them, yet we may not look upon their principles as Oracles. <HI>Nathan</HI> him&s;elf mi&s;&s;ed it in his conjecture about building the hou&s;e of God: He that believes principles, becau&s;e they affirm them, makes Idols of them: and it would be no humility, but ba&s;ene&s;s of &s;pirit, for us to judge our &s;elves uncapable, to Examine the principles that have been handed down to us: If we be any ways fit to open the My&s;teries of the Go&s;pel, we are capable to judge of the&s;e matters: And it would ill become us &s;o to indulge our &s;elves in ea&s;e, as to neglect the Ex|amination of received principles. If the practi&s;es of our Fathers in any particulars were mi&s;takes, it is fit they &s;hould be rejected, if they be not, they will bear Examination: If we be forbidden to Examine their practi&s;es, that will cut off all hopes of Reformation.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of the following Di&s;cour&s;e, is to Exa|mine One practi&s;e of the&s;e Churches, which is thought to be a failing. It was not compo&s;ed on a de&s;ign to be made thus Publick: but the importuni|ty of &s;ome Gentlemen who heard it, has prevailed for the Printing of it.</P>
<P>All that I reque&s;t of the Reader is, That he do not act like tho&s;e who told the Prophet: Jer. 44. 16. <HI>A for the word which thou ha&s;t Spoken to us in the Name <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 word"> and we will not hearken to thee.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Inexcu&s;ablene&s;s OF NEGLECTING THE Wor&s;hip of GOD, under a pretence of being in an Unconverted Condition.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Exodus XII. 47, 48.</BIBL>
<Q>All the Congregation of I&s;rael &s;hall keep it. And when a &s;tranger &s;hall &s;ojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the Lord, let all his Males be circumci&s;ed, and then let him come near and keep it: and he &s;hall be as one that is born in the land: for no un|circumci&s;ed per&s;on &s;hall eat thereof.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this Chapter we have the In&s;titution of the Pa&s;sover, and the &s;everal Laws and Ordinances, that were to be attend|ed in the celebration of it. Two of which are &s;et down in the&s;e Ver&s;es: Fir&s;t, <HI>v.</HI> 47. <HI>All the Congregation of I&s;rael &s;hall keep it.</HI> This mu&s;t be under&s;tood with its excepti|ons.
<PB N="2" REF="001372_0006_0FB292CCDAF0BA80">Tho&s;e that were Unclean, were not to keep it until they were clean&s;ed: <HI>Numb.</HI> 9. 13. <HI>The man that is clean &amp; is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the Passover, even the &s;ame &s;oul &s;hall be cut off from his People.</HI> Another exception was of the Females: Women were not bound to go to the place which God &s;hould choo&s;e, where the Pa&s;sover was to be kept: <HI>Exod.</HI> 23. 17. <HI>Three times in the year &s;hall all thy Males ap|pear before the Lord God.</HI> Yet when they were pre&s;ent they were bound to keep it. <HI>Exod.</HI> 12. 4. <HI>If the hou&s;ehold be too little for the Lamb, let him &amp; his neighbour next unto his hou&s;e, take it according to the number of the &s;ouls.</HI> Mo&s;t probably al&s;o, they that were cut off from their People by a &s;en|tence of Excommunication, were not to keep it. Secondly, <HI>v.</HI> 48. The &s;tranger is allowed to keep it upon two conditions. (1) That he did de&s;ire it. Sometimes &s;trangers that dwelt among them, became pro&s;elites and did de&s;ire to keep this Ordinance as they were not to be com|pelled, &s;o they were not to be rejected, if they de&s;ired it in an orderly way. (2) That all his Males were circumci&s;ed. Circumci&s;ion was a token of God's Covenant, when they were cir|cumci&s;ed, they were incorporated, and became as tho&s;e, who were born in the Land, and en|joyed equal priviledges with natural I&s;raelites.</P>
<P>The <HI>Doctrine</HI> to be &s;poken to, is, 
<PB N="3" REF="001372_0007_0FB292CE48CA59D8">
That Sanctifying Grace is not nece&s;&s;ary unto the Law|full attending of any duty of Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>The whole Congregation whether &s;incerely Godly or not, were to keep the Pa&s;sover: Sancti|fying Grace is an ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing, far be|yond all the common gifts of the Spirit; it is the very Life of the Soul, it fus it to &s;erve God &amp; to enjoy communion with him; and Sanctifying Grace is nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation: without holi|ne&s;s no man can &s;ee the face of God: Yea, Sanctifying Grace is nece&s;&s;ary to the accepta|ble attendance of every duty of Wor&s;hip; if men were not holy their offerings were not ac|ceptable, nor their Sacrifices &s;weet to God: but Sanctifying Grace is not nece&s;&s;ary to the law|ful attending of any duty of Wor&s;hip: if men be not holy, yet it is lawful for them to attend any duty of Wor&s;hip: No duty of Wor&s;hip is forbidden to men, becau&s;e they are de&s;titute of Sanctifying Grace. From the beginning of the World to this day, Men were never forbidden any duty of Wor&s;hip, for want of Sanctifying Grace. Sanctifying Grace is nece&s;&s;ary unto the right di&s;charge of moral duties, as well as in|&s;tituted: but it is not nece&s;&s;ary unto the lawful attending of Moral duties, or the lawful at|tending of In&s;tituted duties; and as men may not excu&s;e them&s;elves from moral duties from the want of Grace, &s;o they may not excu&s;e them&s;elves from any duty of Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001372_0008_0FB292CFB8AFDB28">
I &s;hall clear up the Truth of this Doctrine by an Induction of particulars.</P>
<P>I. <HI>Sanctifying Grace is not nece&s;&s;ary unto the at|tending of tho&s;e duties of Wor&s;hip which are required in all Ages.</HI> There are &s;ome duties of Wor&s;hip that are not peculiar either to the State of the Church in the time of the Old Te&s;tament, or of the New, but common to both: and they may be attended by &s;uch as are Godly, and &s;uch as are not. Men in a natural condition may lawfully attend them; Mens being in a natu|ral condition is no &s;ufficient pretence for neg|lecting of them. <HI>As,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Prayer:</HI> Such mens Prayers are an abomi|nation unto God. <HI>Prov.</HI> 28. 9. <HI>He that turneth a|way his Ear from hearing the law, even his Prayer &s;hall be abomination;</HI> but yet they are to be performed. It is the duty of all men to Pray to God, <HI>Luk.</HI> 18. 1. <HI>He &s;pake a parable to them to this end that men ought always to pray:</HI> The Phari&s;ees were blamed by Chri&s;t for Praying in the Streets, that they might have glory from men, and for making long Prayers for a pretence; but they are not blamed for Praying. Ungodly men are much blamed in Scripture for not Praying: <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 14. 4. <HI>They call not upon God.</HI> I&s;ai. 43 22. <HI>Thou ha&s;t not called upon me, O Jacob.</HI> So men are bla|med for leaving off Praying: <HI>Job</HI> 27. 10. <HI>Will he always call upon God:</HI> And <HI>chap.</HI> 36. <HI>v.</HI> 13. <HI>They cry not when he bindeth them.</HI> All forts of men are directed to cry to God in their nece&s;&s;ities:
<PB N="5" REF="001372_0009_0FB292D1F5011780">Sinners are put upon it to cry to God: <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 55. 6. <HI>Seek ye the Lord while be may be found, ca&s;t ye upon him while he is near.</HI> Such as are Ungod|ly are &s;tirred up to Pray to God for forgivene&s;s: <HI>Act.</HI> 3. 22. <HI>Pray God if perhaps the thought of thy heart may be forgiven.</HI> It was the manner of the People of I&s;rael good &amp; bad to Pray: <HI>Luk.</HI> 1. 10. <HI>The whole multitude of the People were Praying with|out at the time of incen&s;e.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Hearing of the Word.</HI> Men mu&s;t a&s;&s;emble them&s;elves on the Sabbath to hear the Word. <HI>Lev.</HI> 23. 3. <HI>The &s;eventh day is a Sabbath of re&s;t an boly convocation.</HI> Ungodly men mu&s;t do it in order to their Conver&s;ion: The Word of God is the Means of Conver&s;ion: <HI>Jam.</HI> 1. 18. <HI>Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth.</HI> The word of God teaches men to turn to God: it holds forth Conviction, Warning, Incourage|ment &amp; Direction. <HI>Rom.</HI> 10. 14. <HI>How &s;hall they believe on him, of whom they have not heard.</HI> The word of God is the means of Regeneration: <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 19. 7. <HI>The law of the Lord is perfect Conver|ting the Soul.</HI> Therefore Mini&s;ters mu&s;t Preach the Word to all &s;orts of men, good &amp; bad, Chri&s;t Preached to the Multitude, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5. 1, 2. So did John the Bapti&s;t, &s;o the Apo&s;tles: And it is &s;poken of as a very bad thing for men to withdraw them|&s;elves from the a&s;&s;emblies of the People of God: <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 25. Yea it is lawful to Preach the word of God to the Heathen: there was a tempora|ry command to the Di&s;ciples, that they &s;hould
<PB N="6" REF="001372_0010_0FB292DA3892FC88"><HI>not go into the way of the Gentiles, Mat.</HI> 10. 5. But afterward they were commanded, to <HI>teach all Nations, Mat.</HI> 28. 19. And go into all the world and Preach the Go&s;pel to every Creature; and if it be lawful to Preach to them, it is lawful for them to hear it.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Preaching of the Word: It is upon all accounts mo&s;t de&s;ireable, that Preachers &s;hould be Godly men,</HI> and <HI>Caeteris Paribus,</HI> they that are Converted them&s;elves are mo&s;t likely to be in&s;truments of the Conver&s;ion of Sinners, and the Edification of Saints. Yet it is lawful for men in a natural condition to Preach the Word Chri&s;t Je&s;us &s;ent out <HI>Judas</HI> to Preach the Go&s;pel as well as the other Di&s;ciples: <HI>Mat.</HI> 10. 7. It was the work of the Prie&s;ts and Levites to Preach to the Peo|ple of <HI>I&s;rael: Deut.</HI> 33. 10. <HI>They &s;hall teach Jacob thy law, and I&s;rael thy judgments.</HI> But we have no rea&s;on to think that they were all Godly. God gave extraordinary gifts in the Primitive times to &s;ome that were not Godly, to fit them for Preachers, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. 11. <HI>If I &s;peak with the tongue of Men &amp; Angels, and have not charity,</HI> &amp;c. Chri&s;t directed the People to attend on the Preaching of the Scribes &amp; Phari&s;ees. <HI>The Scribes &amp; Pha|ri&s;ees, &s;et in Mo&s;es &s;eat; what&s;oever therefore they bid you ob&s;erve, that ob&s;erve and do.</HI> And <HI>Paul</HI> rejoy|ced in &s;ome mens Preaching of Chri&s;t, though they did it with a bad &s;pirit, <HI>Phil.</HI> 1. 18.</P>
<P>II. <HI>Sanctifying Grace was not nece&s;&s;ary unto tho&s;e duties of Wor&s;hip, that were peculiar to the times of
<PB N="7" REF="001372_0011_0FB292DCABADE668">the Old Te&s;hament.</HI> There were &s;everals acts of wor&s;hip that were In&s;tituted of Old, but have been aboli&s;hed long &s;ince; when they were Divine in&s;titutions, they were to be attended, not only by Godly, but al&s;o by Natural men.</P>
<P>As,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Circumci&s;ion:</HI> Circumci&s;ion was an holy Ordinance, a token of the Covenant between God and his People: but multitudes of People were according to the Ordinance of God to be Circumci&s;ed in the fle&s;h, that were not circum|ci&s;ed in heart. God never blamed the People of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> for Circumci&s;ing per&s;ons that were not Regenerate. <HI>Abraham</HI> was appointed to Cir|cumci&s;e all the Males in his Family: <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 12, 13. <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> was Circumci&s;ed, but yet a carnal per|&s;on: <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 25. When the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> bought Ser|vants from among the Heathen, they were bound to Circumci&s;e them. All the I&s;raeliti&s;h Male Children were in their &s;everal Generations to be Circumci&s;ed, yet there were but few of them that proved Godly. God ordered that the Con|gregation of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;hould be Circumci&s;ed at <HI>Gil|gal: Jo&s;h.</HI> 5. 2. <HI>At that time the Lord &s;aid unto Ju&s;hua, make thee &s;harp knives, &amp; circumci&s;e again the chil|dren of I&s;rael the &s;econd time:</HI> yet multitudes of them were carnal men.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Pa&s;sover:</HI> This was a memorial of the Angels pa&s;&s;ing over the hou&s;es of the I&s;raelites, when the fir&s;t born of the AEgyptians were &s;lain, <HI>Exod.</HI> 12. 27. which was a Type of our Redemp|tion
<PB N="8" REF="001372_0012_0FB292DE1CE0DA50">by Chri&s;t; therefore Chri&s;t is called our Pa&s;sover: 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 7. <HI>Chri&s;t our Pa&s;sover is Sacrifi|ced for us.</HI> And it was lawful for men to partake of the Pa&s;sover who were not Regenerated, for it was Gods appointment that the whole Con|gregation &s;hould keep it: <HI>Exod.</HI> 12. 47. At the time of the fir&s;t In&s;titution there were very few God|ly among them, for they are called <HI>an evil Gene|ration.</HI> And &s;o at many other times; yet God threatens tho&s;e that under any pretence did neg|lect to celebrate the Pa&s;sover, if they were clean and not in a Journey, <HI>Numb.</HI> 9. 13. And <HI>Hezekiah</HI> &s;ent to invite the People of <HI>Ephraim</HI> &amp; <HI>Mana&s;&s;eb,</HI> and other Tribes to celebrate the Pa&s;sover, tho' they had lived in Idolatry for &s;ome Ages, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 30. 1. <HI>And Hezekiah &s;ent to all I&s;rael &amp; Judah, &amp; wrote letters al&s;o to Ephraim &amp; Mana&s;&s;eb, that they &s;hould come to the hou&s;e of the Lord at Jeru&s;alem, to keep the Pa&s;sover to the Lord God of I&s;rael.</HI> And Je|&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf partook of the Pa&s;sover along with Judas: <HI>Luk.</HI> 22. 13, 14. <HI>They made ready the Pa&s;sover, and when the hour was come, he &s;at down and the twelve Apo&s;tles with him.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Offering of Sacrifice:</HI> Many times the whole Congregation of I&s;rael offered Sacrifices to the Lord, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 29. 20, 21. Though multitudes of them were in a natural condition. Any one of the People of I&s;rael had his liberty as he &s;aw oc|ca&s;ion to bring his Sacrifice to the Lord, <HI>Lev.</HI> 1. 2. Yea not only the People of I&s;rael, but the Stran|gets among them, had a liberty to bring their
<PB N="9" REF="001372_0013_0FB292DFFACDD928">Sacrifices, <HI>Lev.</HI> 22. 18, 19. <HI>Wheever he be of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, or of the Strangers in I&s;rael that will offer his oblation for all his Vows, and for all his free|will offerings, which they will offer unto the Lord, for a burnt offering: Ye &s;hall offer it at your own will, a male without blemi&s;h.</HI> And in many cafes the People of I&s;rael were bound to bring their offer|ings. So the Sin-offerings for Sins of Ignorance, <HI>Lev.</HI> 4. The tre&s;pa&s;s offerings for Sins wittingly committed, <HI>Lev.</HI> 6. 10. So when they were clean|&s;ed from the Lepro&s;y; and in many other ca&s;es: they indeed did it in a very provoking way be|cau&s;e they lived in wickedne&s;s, <HI>Jer.</HI> 6. 20. He tells them, <HI>their offerings were not acceptable, nor their Sacrifices &s;weet to him.</HI> But it was lawful for them, whether Regenerate or Unregenerate to bring their Sacrifices.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Officiating in the work of the Prie&s;t-hood.</HI> The Prie&s;ts be&s;ides teaching of the People, were bound to many other Services: as the offering of their Sacrifices at the brazen Altar; the &s;et|ting the &s;hew bread in order; the lighting of the Lamps; the offering of Incen&s;e; the judg|ing in ca&s;es of Lepro&s;y; and in all Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal ca&s;es. But if they were not Regenerate yet it was lawful for them to officiate: If they had any blemi&s;h they might not, <HI>Lev.</HI> 21. 17. But the want of Regenerating Grace did not make it unlawful for them to officiate. The Prie&s;t-hood went by lineal de&s;cent from <HI>Aaron,</HI> it belonged to them by Generation, not by Rege|neration:
<PB N="10" REF="001372_0014_0FB292E1142E9488">and it is unrea&s;onable to think that all the Po&s;terity of <HI>Aaron</HI> were Regenerate. <HI>Hophni</HI> &amp; <HI>Phineas</HI> were not, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2. 12. <HI>The Sons of Eli were Sons of Belial, they knew not the Lord.</HI> And the chief Prie&s;ts were principal Enemies to Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>III. <HI>Sanctifying Grace is not nece&s;&s;ary unto the at|tending &s;uch duties of Wor&s;hip, as are peculiar to the times of the New-Te&s;tament.</HI> There be a few du|ties of Wor&s;hip that are peculiar to the&s;e times of the New-Te&s;tament, but there's no peculiar qualifications requi&s;ite in tho&s;e that do attend them: they agree with the Wor&s;hip in the time of the Old Te&s;tament, &s;o that they are to be attended by the Members of the Vi&s;ible Church.</P>

And it is the appointment of God that the Children of his vi&s;ible People, &s;hould be Bapri&s;ed, who are generally at that time in a na|tural condition. If Unregenerate Per&s;ons might not be Bapti&s;ed, the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> would not have been blamed for neglecting Bapti&s;m: they would have been excu&s;ed, as not prepared for it: but they are condemned for not being Bap|tized, <HI>Luk.</HI> 7. 30. <HI>The Phari&s;ees &amp; Lawyers rejected the coun&s;el of God again&s;t them&s;elves, not being Bap|tized of him.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Lords Supper:</HI> No Scandalous per&s;on may be admitted to Bapti&s;m, neither may any Scandalous per&s;on be admitted to the Lords.

Such per&s;ons as might lawfully come to the Pa&s;sover, may al&s;o if they have Knowledge to di&s;cern the Lords-body, lawfully come to the Lords-Supper, for they are alike figures; the Pa&s;sover was a type of Chri&s;t to dye; the Lords-Supper is a repre|&s;entation of Chri&s;t who has dyed: It is lawful for Unregenerate men to celebrate the Memo|ry of the death of Chri&s;t, which is a great incou|ragement &amp; comfort unto them; and &s;o they do in this Ordinance: It is lawful for Unrege|nerate men to give a Solemn Te&s;timony to the vertue of the death of Chri&s;t, and &s;hew it forth;
<PB N="12" REF="001372_0016_0FB292E414FF2328">and &s;o they do in this Ordinance, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 26. <HI>Ye &s;hew forth the Lords Death till be come.</HI> That which God teaches us in this Ordinance, is very needful for Unregenerate men to learn; name|ly the in&s;ufficiency of all other things be&s;ides the death of Chri&s;t for Salvation, and the al&s;uf|ficiency of Chri&s;t for Salvation: that which we profe&s;s in this Ordinance is very fit for Unrege|rate men to profe&s;s; namely the need of Chri&s;t, and &s;aving vertue of his blood: as it may be of great advantage to natural men to hear Gods Promi&s;e in the Covenant of Grace. So to &s;ee God &s;etting his Seal to the Covenant of Grace. If it be lawful for all the Adult Members of the Church to partake of the Lords-Supper, then it is lawful for &s;ome Unregenerate men to do it: but it is lawful for all the Adult Members of the Church to do it: this was the practice in the primitive Church, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 17. <HI>We are all parta|kers of that one bread:</HI> If it be lawful for the Church to require Unregenerate per&s;ons to come to the Lords Supper, then it is lawful for them to come; but it is lawful for the Church to require all its Adult Members to keep the Cove|nant with God: If it be lawful for an Ungenerate man to be in Covenant with God, it is lawful for them to come to the Lords Supper, for if it be lawful for them to be in Covenant, it is law|ful for them to keep Covenant: If Sanctification were a nece&s;&s;ary qualification to partaking in the Lords Supper, than it would be a very Sinful.
<PB N="13" REF="001372_0017_0FB292E5F68BCA78">thing for any un&s;anctifyed per&s;on to come, tho' he hoped he was Godly, tho' he was con&s;ident of his Godline&s;s. When Chri&s;t In&s;tituted this Ordinance, He commanded his Di&s;ciples to at|tend it, <HI>Luk.</HI> 22. 19. Therefore it is an Ordi|nance to be attended by the whole Church, by all the Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, that have Knowledge. If Sanctification were a nece&s;&s;ary qualification, in order to partaking, then the Church &s;hould let no others come, and then God would have gi|ven them a certain Rule in attending of which, they might keep all others away. Men had need have good arguments to make the World believe, that coming to the Lords Table is a priviledge equally confined with Ju&s;tification, Adoption and eternal Glory; and that none may venture to the Lords Table, but tho&s;e that &s;hall be admitted into the Kingdom of Heaven.</P>

The ble&s;&s;ing of this Ordinance does not depend upon the Piety of him that doth admini&s;ter it. Chri&s;t knew <HI>Ju|das</HI> to be Unregenerate, yet he let him as well as the re&s;t of the Di&s;ciples to admini&s;ter Bap|ti&s;m: <HI>Joh.</HI> 4. 2. <HI>Jo&s;us baptized not but his Di&s;ci|ples.</HI> If men be de&s;titute of Regenerating Grace, yet they may admini&s;ter Gods Ordinances in &s;uch a manner as may be for the glory of God, and the Edification of his People. It is mo&s;t
<PB N="14" REF="001372_0018_0FB292E704863018">de&s;irable upon all accounts that they who Offi|ciate in the work of the Mini&s;try, be holy and gracious men: but men that are de&s;titute of Grace are not prohibited in the word of God to admini&s;ter the Ordinances of God, if &s;uch may Preach &s;urely they may admini&s;ter Sacraments. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaks of Preaching as a greater work than admini&s;tring. Bapti&s;m, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 17. And we may argue that it is greater than admini&s;tring the Lords Supper.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;ons of the Doctrine we,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There is no certain, knowledge who have Sanctifying Grace.</HI> If we &s;hould be limited by God, &s;o that we might admit none to Church fellow&s;hip, but &s;uch as have Sanctifying Grace, we &s;hould be under extream difficulties &amp; great &s;cruples of Con&s;cience; for if we make the mo&s;t exact &s;earch, we &s;hould often be very much mi&s;taken, and in danger to accept of &s;ome that were not &s;incere, and to reject &s;ome that were &s;incere. There is no certain rule given in the Scripture to the guides of the Church, where|by they can di&s;tingui&s;h Saints from Hypocrites; neither do many Per&s;ons know what to make of them&s;elves: Some that are Godly have ma|ny fears whether their hearts be right in the &s;ight of God: which is implyed in that Pre|cept, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 10. <HI>Give all diligence to make your Calling and your Election &s;ure.</HI> And many Hypo|crites have a great con&s;idence that they are Saints, <HI>Joh.</HI> 9. 40. <HI>Are we blind al&s;o?</HI> It is not
<PB N="15" REF="001372_0019_0FB292E8819BD5B0">to be imagined that God would give a Rule to his People that is impracticable: If that were the Rule that only Godly men, were to be ad|mitted to communion in the Church, there is not knowledge enough upon Earth in order to the practice of it: the Church through their ignorance mu&s;t wholly forbear acting: for their knowledge of other mens Piety is but a &s;uppo&s;ition, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5. 12. <HI>By Silvanus, a faithful brother as I &s;uppo&s;e.</HI> And particular Per&s;ons, would never be able to attend that Rule for want of the knowledge of them&s;elves; &s;ome would exclude them&s;elves, and others would obtrude them&s;elves contrary to it, &s;o that the Rule would come to nothing. Gods Rules are &s;uch that no man has any ju&s;t cau&s;e to object again&s;t them: but if this were the Rule that Godly men only might enjoy Ordinances; the Church might object, that it is Gods preroga|tive to know the hearts of men, and we are ut|terly uncapable to attend that Rule.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It is needful that others &s;hould attend duties of Wor&s;hip, that the Wor&s;hip of God may be carryed on.</HI> In the flouri&s;hing times of the Church, that will hold, <HI>Mat.</HI> 20. 16. <HI>Many are called and few are cho&s;en:</HI> but there be degenerate times, when Religion runs very low among the People of God; and at &s;uch a time, there is a great &s;car|city of Godly men, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 12. 1. <HI>The Godly man cea&s;eth, the faithful fail from among the Children of men.</HI> I&s;ai. 53. 1. <HI>Who hath believed our Repors,</HI>

Yea if none but holy men mu&s;t Offici|ate in the Church; they would be nece&s;&s;itated many times to be de&s;titute of Mini&s;ters: in &s;ome Countrys e&s;pecially it would be a difficult thing to find men qualifyed with Sanctifying Grace. Sometimes there is a great &s;carcity of Godly Magi&s;trates: <HI>Jer.</HI> 5. 1. <HI>Run to and fro through the Streets of Jeru&s;alem, and &s;ee now &amp; know and &s;eek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be any that executeth Judgment, that &s;eeketh the truth, and I will pardon it.</HI> So many times there is a great &s;carcity of Godly Mini|&s;ters: <HI>Mat.</HI> 23. 3. <HI>Do not after their works, for they &s;ay and do not.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>This is very u&s;eful that men may obtain Sancti|fying Grace.</HI> If men have it not now yet it will be a wonderful Mercy if they can obtain it be|fore they dye: and the attending duties of Wor&s;hip is very &s;erviceable to that end. There|by they are in the way to be gained, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 29. 9. <HI>In his Temple doth every one &s;peak of his glory.</HI> It is a ble&s;&s;ed thing to be waiting upon God, <HI>Prov.</HI> 8. 34. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is the man that beareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the po&s;ts of my doors.</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="001372_0021_0FB292EC985A5448">The giving of Converting Grace is not Timit|ted to any one Ordinance. Prayer is very &s;er|viceable that way, <HI>Prov.</HI> 2. 3. <HI>If thou crye&s;t after knowledge and lifte&s;t up thy voice for under&s;tanding.</HI> So the Hearing of the Word is very &s;erviceable. The entrance of God's Word giveth light. So the Sacraments are very u&s;eful for Conver&s;ion: God teaches us in Bapti&s;m that we are natu|rally polluted, and that we need to be clean&s;|ed by the blood of Chri&s;t. God in the Lords Supper in vites us to come to Chri&s;t, makes an affecting repre&s;entation of his Sufferings for our Sins, te&s;tifies the Sufficiency of Chri&s;t: con|firms the truth of the Covenant of Grace, teaches us that the Promi&s;e of Salvation to tho&s;e that believe in Chri&s;t is certain; all Sa|craments are Seals of the Covenant, as circum|ci&s;ion was: <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. 11.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The attending of the&s;e duties are part of the External Covenant:</HI> The Covenant People of God are bound to attend Covenant duties. If any part of the External Covenant be neglect|ed, the Covenant is broken. The Covenant that God makes with his Vi&s;ible People ought to be attended, the Vi&s;ible People of God have a natural power to attend tho&s;e duties, &amp; they have a legal power to attend them: they may attend them lawfully: There is no part of the external Covenant, but it may be kept by the Vi&s;ible Church, therefore they have power to qualify them&s;elves &s;ufficiently, in order to the
<PB N="18" REF="001372_0022_0FB292EF86D11630">attending of them: but if Sanctifying Grace were nece&s;&s;ary in order to the lawful attend|ing of them, than it would be out of their power.</P>
<P><HI>The USE of this Doctrine is of Warning; That you be not afraid to attend duties of Wor&s;hip, becau&s;e de&s;titute of Sanctifying Grace.</HI> Men that are de&s;titute of Sanctifying Grace can perform no duty in an acceptable manner: but yet you mu&s;t not give way to a &s;pirit of fear, &s;o as to neglect your duty. Men mu&s;t be afraid to neg|lect it and not afraid to attend it: You mu&s;t make ha&s;te to get Sanctifying Grace, but you mu&s;t not deny God any part of his Wor|&s;hip, till that is done. It is a poor thing for men to be &s;cared into Religion, but it is &s;ad in|deed for men to be &s;cared out of Religion, &amp; to neglect Gods Wor&s;hip out of fear of God.</P>
<P><HI>There be two things that make men neglect the Lords-Supper.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Some de&s;pi&s;e it, they don't find any need of it; their de&s;ign is the World and their plea&s;ures; and they don't regard the Lords-Supper.</HI> There is a pro|phane Spirit prevailing in the Land; and ma|ny men neglect the Lords-Supper from the &s;ame rea&s;on, that they neglect Secret Prayer: <HI>viz.</HI> Becau&s;e they do de&s;pi&s;e holy things, they don't regard communion with God, nor help and advantages to Eternal Life: they are far from that Spirit that <HI>David</HI> had, Who &s;aid, <HI>One thing have I de&s;ired, and that I will &s;eek after, that I may dwell in the hou&s;e of the Lord all the dayes of
<PB N="19" REF="001372_0023_0FB292F330498AB0">my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to en|quire in his Temple.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Some are afraid of it.</HI> They are de&s;irous to do any thing that they can for the promotion of their Salvation; but they are afraid to at|tend that Ordinance. It is with them as it was with <HI>David,</HI> 2 Sam. 6. 9. <HI>And David was afraid of the Lord that day, &amp; &s;aid, how &s;had the Ark of the Lord come to we.</HI> They have drunk in an opini|on, that none but Converted, Per&s;ons &s;hould come to that Ordinance, and &s;o they neglect in: they have been mi&s;-informed about it, and &s;o dare not come: But they &s;hould not be afraid to attend that Ordinance.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider 1. <HI>Tho&s;e who di&s;courage Per&s;ons from coming to it, becau&s;e Unconverted, do in their zeal make others to cea&s;e from fearing the Lord.</HI> As the <HI>Reubenites</HI> and <HI>Gaditer</HI> did argue in &s;ome what alike ca&s;e, <HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> 22. 23, 24. The neglecting outward Wor&s;hip is the way to neglect inward Wor&s;hip. Staying from Ordi|nances is not the way to fit men for Ordinan|ces: the neglecting of the Sacrament is the way to make the Country grow prophane. Gods Ordinances are the means to advance Religion. If they neglect Prayer, it would hinder them from fearing the Lord; if they neglect Hear|ing the Word; if they neglect Bapti&s;m; &s;o likewi&s;e if they neglect the Lords Supper: it will prove no advantage to Religion to neglect any of God's Ordinances; the &s;olemn attending
<PB N="20" REF="001372_0024_0FB292F8CFD39708">of Gods Ordinances lead men into a &s;ence of the need of Chri&s;t, and benefit of Chri&s;t. The limitting of the Lords Supper to a &s;mall num|ber, has a tendency to nouri&s;h carnal con&s;idence in them that are admitted, and to nouri&s;h pro|phanene&s;s in them that are excluded.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>There can be no &s;ufficient rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned, why tho&s;e who are de&s;titute of Sanctifying Grace, &s;hould be debarred from the Lords Supper.</HI> The holine&s;s of the Ordinance can be no rea&s;on: for circum|ci&s;ion and the Pa&s;sover were holy Ordinances, yet many Unregenerate Per&s;ons did partake of them. Bapti&s;m is an holy Ordinance, yet it may be admini&s;tred to Unregenerate men: the &s;ignification of the Lords Supper can be no rea|&s;on, it &s;ignifies Chri&s;t as Suffering for our Sins; the Bread is the &s;ign of his Body, and the Wine the &s;ign of his Blood. So the Water in Bap|ti&s;m, is a &s;ign of the Blood of Chri&s;t, yet may be applyed to Unregenerate Per&s;ons. The &s;ign of Chri&s;t crucifyed is of great u&s;e to put them in mind of Chri&s;t's Sufferings for us: Its being a Seal of the Covenant is no rea&s;on, it is of great u&s;e to them to &s;ee God Sealing his Covenant. As it is of u&s;e for God to declare his Covenant, &s;o to &s;ee God Sealing his Covenant: the Te&s;ti|mony that is given to Chri&s;t in this Ordinance can be no rea&s;on, it is very fit that they as well as others &s;hould &s;hew forth his Death.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Many that judge that Per&s;ons &s;hould be Conver|ted before they come to the Sacrament, do run into a
<PB N="21" REF="001372_0025_0FB292F9C864E148">great fault, viz.</HI> they per&s;wade Per&s;ons that they are Converted before they are: they are zealous again&s;t mens coming to the Lords-Supper in an Unconverted condition, yet advi&s;e &amp; incou|rage &s;uch per&s;ons to come under a notion that they are Converted; if per&s;ons do but carry civilly &amp; religiou&s;ly, they think they are Con|verted, and urge them to joyn to the Church; hereby abundance of wrong is done; men are greatly hardned in a natural E&s;tate: and they are laid under great Temptation to flatter them|&s;elves, as if the bitterne&s;s of death were pa&s;t: this is a means to prevent many mens Conver|&s;ion; if men are made to believe that they are Godly before they be, that is like to prove a mighty impediment unto their Conver&s;ion, they don't lye open to the threatnings of the Word, they think others &s;poken to, and they pity them; but they are not &s;en&s;ible of their own danger: <HI>Joh.</HI> 9. 41. <HI>Becau&s;e you &s;ay, you &s;ee, therefore your &s;in remaineth.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>If none that are de&s;titute of Sanctifying Grace may come, than two &s;orts of Per&s;ons that do come &s;hould &s;tay away.</HI> Fir&s;t, &s;uch per&s;ons as are in a natu|ral condition, yet have got a confidence that they are Converted: there are many &s;uch. <HI>Prov.</HI> 30. 12. <HI>There is a Generation that are pure in their own eyes, yet are not clean&s;ed from their filthine&s;s:</HI> But there is no way to keep them from it, the Church can't keep them from it, becau&s;e they are vi&s;ible Saints: and their own Con&s;ciences will not for|bid
<PB N="22" REF="001372_0026_0FB292FB6E03D8A0">them, becau&s;e they are confident that they are Converted. And Secondly, there is another &s;ort that &s;hould forbear, <HI>viz.</HI> Such Godly men as do not know that they are Converted. If a man be Godly, yet how can he with a good Con|&s;cience come to an Ordinance, peculiar to God|ly men, when he don't know him&s;elf to be God|ly: if only Saints are allowed to come, he mu&s;t know him&s;elf to be a Saint, before he can know that he is allowed of God to come. As if a man has power to Sell nothing but what is his own, then he mu&s;t know a thing to be his own before be can sell it with a good Con&s;cience. Or if a Church have power to con&s;ure only Scanda|lous per&s;ons, then they mu&s;t know a man to be Scandalous before they can with a good Con|&s;cience cen&s;ure him. So in this ca&s;e, if the Sa|crament be only for Godly men, they dont know that they have any right to it, until they know that they are Godly.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>It is from the mi&s;under&s;tanding of one Scripture principally, that the&s;e are afraid to come to the Lords|Supper:</HI> viz. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.

And they are &s;aid <HI>to eat &amp; drink damnation or judgment to them&s;elves:</HI> but this unworthy eating is doing of it in a rude manner, as <HI>v.</HI> 21. <HI>For in eating every one taketh be|fore others his own Supper, and one is hungry &amp; ano|ther

Another expre&s;&s;ion is, <HI>Let a man examine him&s;elf &amp; &s;o let him eat, v.</HI> 28. But it is not &s;aid, Let him examine him&s;elf whether he &s;hould eat or forbear, <HI>but let him Examine him&s;elf, &amp; &s;o let him eat.</HI> The mean|ing is, that he mu&s;t come &s;olemnly to that Or|dinance, Examining what need he has of it.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>The Church is bound to receive men if they be externally qualifyed, whether they be Godly or no.</HI> If men make a profe&s;&s;ion &amp; are not Scandalous in their Conver&s;ation, the Church cannot refu&s;e them. The Apo&s;tle &s;till received tho&s;e that made a profe&s;&s;ion of the Go&s;pel, <HI>Act.</HI> 2. 41. <HI>&amp;</HI> 6. 7. Tho&s;e that are Saints by calling are to be ac|cepted of the Church, whether they be Conver|ted or not. The matter of the Church are vi|&s;ible Saints: if the Church were only to receive tho&s;e that are Converted, God would have gi|ven them a certain rule, in attending of which Unconverted Per&s;ons &s;hould be excluded, but there is no &s;uch Rule given: Neither is there any external &s;ign, that does certainly di&s;tingui&s;h Converted men from Unconverted; the Church is not concerned to &s;ee that they be all real Saints, their work is to &s;ee they be vi&s;ible Saints, if they reject &s;uch they are to blame.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>It cannot be an unlawful thing for men to keep the External Covenant.</HI> As the vi&s;ible People of God have a natural power, &s;o they have a law|ful

<P N="8">8. <HI>It is exceeding &s;trange that it &s;hould be the In&s;titu|tion of God, that only Converted Per&s;ons &s;hould come to the Lords-Supper, and yet no more care taken that that In&s;titution &s;hould be attended.</HI> If it were Gods will that no Unconverted Per&s;ons &s;hould come, it is much that he does not charge his Church to u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours to di&s;cover Secret Hy|pocrites, and to keep them out of the Church,
<PB N="25" REF="001372_0029_0FB29301618E7828">and that he don't command them to pluck up all the Tares that they can di&s;cover among the Wheat; as was propo&s;ed, <HI>Mat.</HI> 13. 28. And is it not much that he does not charge Unconverted men, not to meddle with tho&s;e holy things? &amp; tell them that they mu&s;t content them&s;elves with Praying &amp; Fa&s;ting, and Hearing &amp; being Bap|tized, but proceed no further: but we find no &s;uch injunctions in the Scripture.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>We have no cau&s;e to wonder to find &s;ome Divines of our own Nation, and &s;ome of other Nations to deny that the Supper is a Converting Ordinance.</HI> I find <HI>Wendiline,</HI> a great Divine in his di&s;putations a|gain&s;t the <HI>Lutherans</HI> acknowledging again &amp; a|gain, that the Sacraments may in&s;trumentally be|gin Faith in Adult Per&s;ons; &amp; in another place, &s;aying, That the Sacraments of confirmation; he means the Pa&s;sover, and the Lords-Supper may organically begin Faith. Yet there be a great many Divines that do deny this. But this is not to be wondred at, &s;eeing they hold, That Elect Infants that have faederal holine&s;s, have at the &s;ame time the internal grace of Regeneration. Thus <HI>Voetius Statu. Elect. Unte. Conv.</HI> And he &s;ays, That Dr. <HI>Burges</HI> does prove by many Di|vines, that Elect Infants have an initial &amp; &s;emi|nal Regeneration upon their Bapti&s;m; if it were &s;o, no doubt but their actual Conver&s;ion would be in early days, before they come to that Age, when per&s;ons are wont to be admitted to the Lords Supper.</P>

10. <HI>No Chri&s;tian Country does neglect this Ordinance no we do in this Land.</HI> In our own Nation at home, &s;o in <HI>Scotland, Holland, Denmark, Sweedland,</HI> and among the Prote&s;tants in <HI>Germany</HI> &amp; <HI>France,</HI> they do generally Celebrate the Memorial of Chri&s;ts Death. This Country is &s;ingular in neglecting of it. About Forty years pa&s;t, there were a Multitude in the Country, Unbaptized: but that neglect was taken into Exami|nation, and now there is an alteration in that parti|cular. But to this day there be Four to One that do neglect the Lords-Supper; as if it did not belong to them to magnify God upon the account of the Work of Redemption. We are a People that pretend high in Religion, but indeed we fall &s;hort of other People in the very Form of it, and don't come up in our practice in this particular to many other Churches.</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>The general neglect of this Ordinance is a vi&s;ible denying of the Go&s;pel.</HI> Chri&s;t has threatned to <HI>deny them before his Father, that do deny him before men,</HI> Mat. 10. 33. And the neglect of this In&s;titution is a vi&s;ible denyal of Chri&s;t. Our bu&s;ine&s;s at the Lords Supper is to Celebrate the Memorial of Chri&s;ts Death, &amp; to give our Te&s;timony to the Go&s;pel: 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 26. <HI>As often as ye eat this Bread, &amp; drink this cup, ye &s;hew forth the Lords death till he come.</HI> They therefore that do neglect to do this, do with-hold their Te&s;timony. They act as if they did not believe the Doctrine to be true. What con&s;truction can be put upon it, but that they are unconcerned to give their Te&s;timony to Chri&s;t, and que&s;tion the truth of the Go&s;pel; it is an open reproaching of Chri&s;t, &amp; a vi&s;ible contempt of the Go&s;pel? This neglect has a great tendency, to &s;trengthen &amp; confirm others in their Infidelity; for they act as if they did not believe it. And many Children when they are reproved for their Infidelity,
<PB N="27" REF="001372_0031_0FB29304AD845418">have that excu&s;e for them&s;elves, That their Fathers and Mothers do not believe the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>The neglect of this Ordinance is one great cau&s;e of Gods Judgments.</HI> We are under &s;orrowful di&s;pen&s;ati|ons, and have rea&s;on to conclude this neglect to be one e&s;pecial cau&s;e of them. There be indeed abun|dance of Moral Evils in the Land, that do provoke God to anger: but generally when God brought Judg|ments on I&s;rael, it was mainly for corruptions in Wor&s;hip. As we may not introduce Ceremonies of mens Invention, &s;o we mu&s;t not neglect Ordinances that are of Divine In&s;titution. Neglects of Wor&s;hip bring de&s;troying Judgments: <HI>Exod.</HI> 5. 3. <HI>Let us Sacri|fice to the Lord our God, lest he fall upon us with Pestilence, or with Sword.</HI> Let men have what pretences they will, yet tho&s;e pretences will not excu&s;e them in the neglect of Gods Ordinances. God don't allow men to be &s;cared out of his Wor&s;hip. But I do judge that the generality that do neglect it, do it out of a care|le&s;s and prophane Spirit, and then it is no wonder, if it brings down the Wrath of God.</P>
<P>It is Objected by &s;ome again&s;t this Doctrine, <HI>That if the Lords-Supper be a Converting Ordinance, then not only &s;uch as are Civil &amp; Religious may be admitted to it, but prophane &amp; vicious Per&s;ons for they likewi&s;e need Conver&s;ion, &amp; it is pity but they &s;hould have all helps to Conver&s;ion?</HI></P>
<P>A. 1. <HI>That Bapti&s;m is a Converting Ordinance, but yet is not to be administred to Adult Per&s;ons that are prophane:</HI> For Bapti&s;m is only a Converting Ordinance to the Members of the Church, who are Unconverted. The Hearing of the Word only is the appointed means for the Conver&s;ion of others.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Lords Supper is an Ordinance for the &s;trengthening &amp; exerci&s;ing of Grace:</HI> yet it doth not follow that it is to be admini&s;tred to Godly men, who are guilty of
<PB N="28" REF="001372_0032_0FB2930699D5C500">Scandal, the need that they have to have their Grace &s;trengthned, is no argument that the Lords-Supper &s;hould in that ca&s;e he admini&s;tred to them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Though the Lord Supper is a Converting Ordinance, yet it is not to be admini&s;tred to any prophane &amp; vicious men:</HI> For it is a Converting Ordinance only to tho&s;e that it is appointed to be admini&s;tred unto; <HI>viz</HI> Mem|bers of the Church walking orderly. When Church Members carry Scandalous, there are other Ordinan|ces appointed for their Conver&s;ion, in ca&s;e they be Unconverted.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o Objected, <HI>That the&s;e who were Unclean were not to partake of the Passover,</HI> Numb. 9 7 <HI>which &s;eems to hold forth to us. That tho&s;e that are &s;piritually Unclean in the dayes of the Go&s;pel, may not partake of the Lords-Supper?</HI></P>
<P>A 1. <HI>If tho&s;e that were &s;piritually Unclean might come to the Passover, no rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned why they may not al&s;o come to the Lords Supper:</HI> For the Pa&s;sover was an holy Ordinance as well as the Lords Supper; and the Pa&s;sover ought to be attended in an holy manner, as well as the Supper.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Ordinances of the Old Te&s;tament were not Types of the Ordinances of the New-Te&s;tament.</HI> If the rea&s;on why the Unclean might not come to the Pa&s;sover was to &s;ignify that tho&s;e who were Unregenerate might not come to the Lords-Supper: of what Edification would that In&s;titution be to the Jews. They did not under&s;tand any &s;uch meaning, &amp; if they had, it would have done them no good. But the Ordinances of the Old Te&s;tament did &s;ignify Evangelical Doctrines, which were of great u&s;e to the Jews, &s;o this appointment, that Unclean Per&s;ons might not come to the Pa&s;sover did &s;ignify, that tho&s;e who were &s;piritually Unclean, &s;hould not have communion with God in the highe&s;t Heaven, but be Excluded out of the Kingdom of GOD.</P>
