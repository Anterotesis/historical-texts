<HEAD><HI>REMARKS,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THERE hath lately appear'd a Pamphlet, called the <HI>Quaker Unmask'd,</HI> or <HI>Plain Truth,</HI> a very well wrote Piece indeed, and would be &s;till better, had not the Author made the Hyperbole, his darling Trope.</P>
<P>A Piece of this nature mu&s;t certainly a&s;to|ni&s;h the di&s;cerning, or them who were pre|&s;ent at the late alarming and intere&s;ting Af|fair, and who had an Opportunity of &s;eeing the Rioter's Friends &s;loth and inactivity in endeavouring to &s;uppre&s;s, and their Unani|mity, and Zeal in forwarding and encourage|ing the unprecedented and lawle&s;s proceed|ings of an ignorant and enthu&s;ia&s;tick <HI>Mob.</HI></P>
<P>There hath &s;everal Pieces appeared in pub|lic, on the Occa&s;ion; but a Piece from that &s;ide of the Que&s;tion appearing, was thought impo&s;&s;ible, without it was one that would be compo&s;ed of Apoligies for, and Palliations of the late intriguing Conduct of a rigid &s;ubvert|ing Society in this City; but in&s;tead of that, after favouring the Cau&s;e in private, to e&s;pou&s;e it in public, is &s;urprizing to every bo|dy, and plainly indicates the mo&s;t depravid
<PB N="3" REF="009813_0003_0F7A5455E7F92398">
Ignorance, or that uncommon Audacity, that the Lenity of a Government to ungrate|ful Mon&s;ters is too often productive of.</P>
<P>It hath been ob&s;erved by the Proprietors of <HI>Negroes,</HI> that there is &s;omething &s;o peculi|ar in their Di&s;po&s;ition, that they cannot bear Indulgence; the&s;e People I look upon to be under the &s;ame unhappy Circum&s;tances, not that I would &s;uppo&s;e it &s;o in their original Di&s;|po&s;itions, but owing to the Effect their Prin|ciples have, for they are, and have always been (tho' under the milde&s;t of Govern|ments) a Sett of unea&s;y, di&s;contented, and innovating People.</P>
<P>But <HI>Philadelphia</HI> boa&s;ts of better Men than they; Men, who when Occa&s;ion calls, are ready to take up Arms in Oppo&s;ition to the Enemies of her Welfare. Yet &s;ome of the&s;e
<Q>are called Incendiaries, who are not only enraged them&s;elves, at their dear Friends the Indians, being &s;lain, but would have all the World of their Temper.</Q>
Now, what Intere&s;t can the &s;aving the Lives of the Indians be to the <HI>Q&mdash;rs,</HI> or what Di&s;ad|vantage can accrue to them from their Death, I can't conceive, neither hath our Author (after &s;everal low and impertinent In&s;inua|tions) be able to determine.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that did take up Arms, I am fully convinced, had no other View in it, than the Welfare of the City, and Per&s;ons acting by
<PB N="4" REF="009813_0004_0F7A5456CA177730">
the Principle of Partrioti&s;m, make this their incumbent Duty, not only to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this Principle them&s;elves, but make (as much as in them lies) Pro&s;elytes to it, or in our no|ble Author's Words,
<Q>would have all the World of their Temper.</Q></P>
<P>As for the <HI>Narrative</HI> of the Ma&s;&s;acre, &amp;c. it is a Pamphlet that will bear a recommen|dation to the Peru&s;al of every candid Per&s;on, as there is in it that <HI>Pathos,</HI> that will rou&s;e the Chri&s;tian in the Reader, and excite in him an endeavour to prevent the effu&s;ion of human Blood. And the Author is, as the Work &s;hews him to be, a Gentleman of Integrity, of impartial Judgement, and of Sentiments un|tainted by infectious P&mdash;y.</P>
<P><Q>The&s;e compa&s;&s;ionate and merciful Chri&s;tians, &s;o ea&s;ily affected with Pity for <HI>Indians,</HI> would not grant a &s;ingle Farthing for the Relief of their Fellow Subjects.</Q>
This a&s;&s;ertion is certainly fal&s;e, and again&s;t known Truths (but it is needle&s;s to pick out Paragraphs that are fal&s;e, when there is not a Truth in the whole) for tho' there were no Charity Sermons preached, and no o&s;tenta|tious Collection made in Public, yet it is well known that there were con&s;iderable Sums collected and di&s;tributed among the truly nece&s;&s;itous; but perhaps this A&s;&s;ertion pro|ceeds from their being none di&s;tributed at <PB N="5" REF="009813_0005_0F7A545788EDCFF8">
<HI>Germantown,</HI> a place where &s;ome People made all their Charity center.</P>
<P><Q>Let us impartially next con&s;ider <HI>Quakers</HI> with Re&s;pect to Government. Can it be con&s;i&s;tent that a Per&s;on who declares that his Con&s;cience by divine In&s;piration forbids him to have any Hand in &s;hedding Blood, &s;hould be intru&s;ted as a Repre&s;entative for People, who look upon them&s;elves to be obliged by the Laws of God, the Laws of Nature, and the Laws of their King and Country to take up Arms to defend them|&s;elves, and puni&s;h tho&s;e who would deprive them of Life and Property.</Q>
If <HI>Q&mdash;rs</HI> are under tho&s;e Circum&s;tances, &s;o improper to repre&s;ent a People, (between who&s;e Senti|ments there is &s;o great a Contra&s;t) why are they cho&s;en as &s;uch? They have never ob|tained their Seats in the Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly by either any &s;ecret or under&s;tanding Means, or any open violent Mea&s;ure, but &s;o far from that, what few are in the Hou&s;e, have been annually, by public Adverti&s;ments, declaring their de&s;ire of re&s;igning, and reque&s;ting the Election of others in their Room: If there are &s;o many Di&s;advantages flow from their being Members of a legi&s;lative Body, why is not their reque&s;t complied with? I am cer|tain it can't be alledged, that the Numbers
<PB N="6" REF="009813_0006_0F7A54587A3DE598">
of <HI>Q&mdash;rs</HI> in this Province make a Majority of its inhabitants, nor can it be owing to the Paucity of their avowed Enemies the <HI>Pr&mdash;ns</HI> (for unhappy for it, it &s;warms with them) but their Con&s;tituents, upon probation, &s;eeing the happy Effects of their upright Conduct in every public Tru&s;t, executive as well as legi&s;lative, have always endeavoured (tho' contrary to their Inclinations) &s;till to keep them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it. And I doubt not but this very railer, when the Anniver&s;ary Day of Election comes about, (after an impartial Con&s;ideration of their unexceptionable Con|duct, and a &s;erious Reflection on the Incapa|city of their Enemies) will be the foremo&s;t in oppo&s;ing their removal; for his pre&s;ent In|dignation, is only owing to a little Heat of Blood, occa&s;ioned by the Mi&s;carriage of a late Project.</P>
<P><Q>But it hath been proved, by a very cir|cum&s;tantial Oath of a young Man, who hath &s;ince very unaccountably di&s;appear|ed,</Q>
&amp;c. What a bitter Innuendo is that! But People's knowledge of every Circum|&s;tance relative to it, makes the Invective contained in it, recoil with the greater Force upon them. O unhappy Prede&s;tination! whom I &s;uppo&s;e it was intended to &s;creen and defend.&mdash;And believe me my Country|men, tho&s;e who would be privy to an Inten|tion

of Murder, and would a&s;&s;i&s;t, when they thought Opportunity favoured the putting the Intention in Execution, would perpe|trate a Murder, and rather than their diabo|lical Schemes &s;hould prove abortive in any Point, would work upon the Inexperience of a Youth to commit an Act, that will un|avoidably redound to the Infamy of his In&s;ti|gators. Our Author I believe &s;tudies <HI>Solo|mon</HI> a good deal, as he &s;eems to be well ver|&s;ed in the Art of compo&s;ing Proverbs.&mdash;It is a Pity he had not &s;ome of his Wi&s;dom too.
