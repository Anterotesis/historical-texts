<Q><BIBL>MATTHEW XXV. 31&mdash;46.</BIBL>
<P>When the Son of Man &s;hall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then &s;hall he &s;it upon the throne of his glory. And before him &s;hall be gathered all nations: And he &s;hall &s;eperate them one from another, as a &s;hepherd divideth his &s;heep from the goats. And he &s;hall &s;et the &s;heep on his right hand, but the goats on the left Then &s;hall the King &s;ay unto them on his right hand, Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was an-hungered and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty and ye gave me drink: I was a &s;tranger and ye took me in: Nak|ed and ye cloathed me: I was &s;ick and ye vi&s;ited me: I was in pri&s;on and ye came unto me. Then &s;hall the righteous an&s;wer him, &s;aying, Lord, when &s;aw we thee an-hungered and fed thee? or thirsty and gave thee drink? When &s;aw we thee a &s;tranger and took thee in? or naked and cloathed thee? Or when &s;aw we thee &s;ick or in pri&s;on and came unto thee? And the King &s;hall an&s;wer and &s;ay unto them, Verily I &s;ay unto you, ina&s;much as ye have done it unto one of the least of the&s;e my brethren, ye have done it unto me. Then &s;hall he &s;ay unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cur&s;ed, into everlast|ing fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was an-hungered and ye gave no meat: I was thirsty and ye gave me no drink: I was a &s;tranger and ye took me not in: Naked and ye cloathed me not: Sick and in pri&s;on and ye vi&s;ited me not. Then &s;hall they al&s;o an&s;wer him, &s;aying, Lord, when &s;aw we thee an-hungered, or a thirst, or a &s;tran|ger, or naked, or &s;ick, or in pri&s;on, and did not minister unto thee? Then &s;hall he an&s;wer them, &s;aying, Verily I &s;ay unto you, ina&s;much as ye did it not to one of the least of the&s;e, ye did it not to me. And the&s;e &s;hall go away into everlasting puni&s;hment: but the righteous into life eternal.</P></Q>

<P>IT is the intention of this di&s;cour&s;e, to explain and con|firm the &s;en&s;e of this pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture. And &s;ince &s;cripture is the be&s;t interpreter of it&s;elf, we &s;hall com|pare
<PB N="4" REF="017924_0003_0FA378AB461FFE40">
the various repre&s;entations in the text, with the general tenor of the &s;acred oracles.</P>
<P N="1">I. Our Lord here gives us a particular and lively re|pre&s;entation of the general judgment. "When the Son of Man &s;hall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he &s;hall &s;it upon the throne of his glory. And before him &s;hall be gathered all nations, &amp;c." This de&s;cription of the great day re&s;embles that of &s;e|veral other in&s;pired writers. Enoch al&s;o, the &s;eventh from Adam, prophe&s;ied of it, &s;aying, "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thou&s;ands of his &s;aints to execute judgment upon all." Solomon &s;ays, "God &s;hall bring every work into judgment, with every &s;ecret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil." The a|po&s;tle Paul declares that God hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given a&s;&s;urance unto all men, in that he hath rai&s;ed him from the dead." We are told the fallen angels are "re&s;erved in everla&s;ting chains under darkne&s;s, unto the judgment of the great day." And the apo&s;tle John be|held in vi&s;ion this great, and glorious, and &s;olemn &s;cene. "I &s;aw the dead, &s;mall and great, &s;tand before God; and the books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life: And the dead were judged out of tho&s;e things which were written in the books according to their works." The&s;e declarations are too explicit to need any comment; they literally &s;peak the language of the text, and confirm the repre|&s;entation it gives of the general judgment: Which is al&s;o agreeable to the nature and apprehen&s;ions of man|kind as well as the character of the Deity and the pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;ations of divine providence.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="017924_0004_0FA378AC06278FC0">It is, in the fir&s;t place, perfectly con&s;onant to the na|ture of men as moral agents. They are endued with perception, rea&s;on, memory, con&s;cience, and all the powers and faculties which are requi&s;ite to moral agency. And being moral agents, they are proper &s;ubjects of law and moral government. The Supreme Being there|fore will treat them but according to their nature, to call them to an account for all the deeds done in the body, and give them a ju&s;t recompen&s;e of reward. Hence e|very man carries in the very frame and con&s;titution of his nature an irre&s;i&s;tible evidence of a future judgment.</P>
<P>Accordingly, this is agreeable to the natural appre|hen&s;ions of mankind. As they are &s;en&s;ible they lie open and naked to the view of the omni&s;cient God, &s;o they naturally expect he will call them to an account for all the inward motions and exerci&s;es of their hearts as well as outward actions of their lives. The man who em|brues his hand in the blood of his fellow-creature, though concealed from every other eye but the omni|&s;cient, has a &s;ecret fearful apprehen&s;ion of the righteous judgment of God. And, though he is neither accu&s;ed nor &s;u&s;pected of his crime, yet his own con&s;cience binds him over to the judgment of the great day. This is the &s;ecret voice of nature, which has di&s;covered it&s;elf on many occa&s;ions. The Barbarians, when they &s;aw the viper on Paul's hand, "Said among them&s;elves, no doubt this man is a murderer, whom though he hath e&s;caped the &s;ea, yet vengeance &s;uffereth <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to live." The mariners in the &s;hip with Jonah, when they found them&s;elves in danger of peri&s;hing by a mighty tempe&s;t, "Said, come let us ca&s;t lots, that we may know for who&s;e cau&s;e this evil is come upon us" And when Jo&s;eph's brethren were thru&s;t into pri&s;on, and &s;ubjected
<PB N="6" REF="017924_0005_0FA378ACC4908C70">
to great and unexpected misfortunes, they immediately recollect their cruel and unnatural treatment of their brother, as the procuring cau&s;e of their pre&s;ent calamities. "They &s;aid one to another, we are verily guilty con|cerning our brother, in that we &s;aw the angui&s;h of his &s;oul, when he be&s;ought us, and we would not hear: Therefore is this di&s;tre&s;s come upon us." All men thus feel the natural connection between moral evil and phy+&s;ical, between &s;inning and &s;uffering, between guilt and puni&s;hment. Hence every man's con&s;cience pre&s;ages a future day of retribution, when he mu&s;t give an account of him&s;elf to God, as the &s;upreme and final Judge.</P>
<P>And this is further confirmed by the rectitude of the divine character and government. Since the Author of Nature is infinitely holy, ju&s;t and good, he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily conduct agreeably to the&s;e divine attributes in the government of moral beings, and di&s;pen&s;e rewards and puni&s;hments according to their re&s;pective characters. The pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, however, clearly evinces that the day of retribution is yet to come. Here, as Solomon ob&s;erves, all things come alike to all, there is one event to the righteous and the wicked, and no man knoweth either love or hatred, by the pre&s;ent di&s;|pen&s;ations of divine providence towards him. But as things cannot always continue &s;o under the admini&s;tra|tions of a Being of perfect rectitude; &s;o the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the world is a clear demon&s;tration of a future general judgment, when the Supreme Being will review the conduct of all his intelligent creatures, and reward the righteous and puni&s;h the wicked according to their works.</P>
<P N="2">II. Our Lord &s;peaks of one di&s;tinction in the characters
<PB N="7" REF="017924_0006_0FA378AD86551BE8">
of men, which will ab&s;orb all other di&s;tinctions, and divide the whole world into two cla&s;&s;es at the la&s;t day. "Before him &s;hall be gathered all nations: And he &s;hall &s;eparate them one from another, as a &s;hepherd divideth his &s;heep from the goats: And he &s;hall &s;et the &s;heep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. Then &s;hall the King &s;ay unto them on his right hand, Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> my Father, &amp;c.&mdash;For I was an-hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thir&s;ty, and ye gave me drink: I was a &s;tranger, and ye took me in: Naked and ye clothed me: I was &s;ick, and ye vi&s;ited me: I was in pri&s;on, and ye came unto me. Then &s;hall he &s;ay al&s;o unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cur&s;ed, &amp;c.&mdash;For I was an-hungered, and ye gave me no meat: I was thir&s;ty, and ye gave me no drink: I was a &s;tran|ger, and ye took me not in: Naked, and ye clothed me not: &s;ick and in pri&s;on, and ye vi&s;ited me not."</P>
<P>In many re&s;pects the righteous and the wicked re|&s;emble each other. They are often alike as to their natural powers and abilities. In this view, Ab&s;alom, Joab and Ahitophel re&s;embled Mo&s;es, David and Solo|mon. There is al&s;o a re&s;emblance in their natural tem|pers and di&s;po&s;itions. Ab&s;alom and the young man in the go&s;pel, were perhaps, in this re&s;pect, as amiable as Mo&s;es, or the beloved di&s;ciple who leaned on Je&s;us' brea&s;t. The&s;e, and many other circum&s;tances which ari&s;e from birth, rank, fortune, religious denominations, &amp;c. are common both to the righteous and the wicked, and will not characteri&s;e mankind at the la&s;t day. But there is a difference in the HEARTS of men, which forms a capital di&s;tinction in their characters, and will finally place &s;ome on the right, and &s;ome on the left hand of their Judge. And this is the di&s;tinction, which
<PB N="8" REF="017924_0007_0FA378AE45725538">
our Lord here mentions and de&s;cribes. He repre&s;ents the righteous as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that divine love and charity, by which they &s;ought the glory of God and the good of their fellow creatures in all their actions. But he repre|&s;ents the wicked as actuated by a low, mean, merce|nary, contracted di&s;po&s;ition, which confined all their views and pur&s;uits to their own good. Both the&s;e di&s;|po&s;itions are de&s;cribed by the apo&s;tle Paul. His di&s;crip|tion of charity or divine love is in the&s;e words. "Though I &s;peak with the tongues of men and of an|gels, and have not charity, I am become as &s;ounding bra&s;s, or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and under&s;tand all my&s;teries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, &s;o that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I be&s;tow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not cha|rity, it profiteth me nothing." So &s;ays our Lord in the text: But the de&s;cription continues. "Charity &s;uffer|eth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not it&s;elf, is not puffed up, doth not behave it&s;elf un&s;eemly, <HI>&s;eeketh not her own,</HI> &amp;c. Whereas the contrary di&s;po&s;ition, the apo&s;tle &s;ays, makes "men lo|vers of their own &s;elves, covetous, boa&s;ters, proud, bla&s;phemers, di&s;obedient to parents, unthankful, unho|ly, without natural affection, truce-breakers, fal&s;e ac|cu&s;ers, incontinent, fierce, de&s;pi&s;ers of tho&s;e that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of plea&s;ure, more than lovers of God." Heat and cold, light and darkne&s;s cannot be more diametrically oppo&s;ite in their nature and effects, than the&s;e two di&s;po&s;itions are. And &s;ince all mankind are governed by one or the other of the&s;e two principles of action, &s;o there is an e&s;&s;ential di&s;tinction in their characters, which ju&s;tly denominates
<PB N="9" REF="017924_0008_0FA378AF04BAC8F0">
them all either righteous or wicked. Accordingly we find the &s;cripture every where takes notice of this capi|tal di&s;tinction in the characters of men, and marks it by &s;uch di&s;criminating epithets as the&s;e&mdash;the godly and the ungodly&mdash;the holy and the unholy&mdash;the ju&s;t and the unju&s;t&mdash;&s;aints and &s;inners&mdash;the friends of God and the enemies of God&mdash;the children of light and the chil|dren of darkne&s;s&mdash;the children of God and the children of the devil.</P>
<P>As this di&s;tinction is of great importance, and clo&s;ely connected with the &s;ubject before us, we &s;hall con&s;ider it a little more particularly.</P>
<P>The Supreme Being, in the cour&s;e of providence, hath acknowledged and-paid a vi&s;ible regard to this di&s;|tinction between the righteous and the wicked. In de&s;|cribing the character of Noah, he repre&s;ents him as e&s;|&s;entially different from the re&s;t of mankind at that day. "God looked upon the earth, and behold it was corrupt: For all fle&s;h had corrupted his way upon the earth:&mdash; And the Lord &s;aid unto Noah, come thou, and all thy hou&s;e into the ark: For thee have I &s;een <HI>righteous</HI> be|fore me in this generation." Here God di&s;tingui&s;hed the <HI>righteous from the wicked,</HI> and, to exhibit a public and vi&s;ible regard to this di&s;tinction, he &s;aved the righteous and de&s;troyed the wicked.</P>
<P>He likewi&s;e a&s;&s;erted and vindicated the di&s;tingui&s;hing character of Job. "The Lord &s;aid unto Satan, Ha&s;t thou con&s;idered my &s;ervant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and upright man, one that feareth God and e&s;cheweth evil" The great accu&s;er of the brethren di&s;puted the truth of this divine declaration.
<PB N="10" REF="017924_0009_0FA378B024E41780">
"Then Satan an&s;wered the Lord, and &s;aid, Doth Job fear God for nought? Ha&s;t thou not made an hedge about him, and about his hou&s;e, and about all he hath on every &s;ide? Thou ha&s;t ble&s;&s;ed the work of his hands; and his &s;ub&s;tance is increa&s;ed in the land. But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will cur&s;e thee to thy face." As if he had &s;aid, There is no|thing &s;ingular in the character of Job. He conducts no otherwi&s;e than any other per&s;on would in the &s;ame &s;itua|tion. Let any other man receive equal tokens of thy love and favour, and he will make equal returns of gra|titude and obedience. Sinners love tho&s;e that love them. He is, like all other men, entirely governed by merce|nary motives. Therefore only touch his intere&s;t, and &s;trip him of tho&s;e peculiar favours thou ha&s;t lavi&s;hed upon him, and he will drop the ma&s;k, di&s;cover his hypocri&s;y, and cur&s;e thee to thy face. To wipe off the&s;e a&s;per&s;ions from Job's character, and to con|vince Satan that he acted from truly noble, di&s;intere&s;ted motives, God gives him leave to try him with any af|flictions or calamities &s;hort of death. Satan with plea|&s;ure makes the experiment. He brings a train of evils upon Job in thick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. He &s;trips him of his wealth. He &s;lays his &s;ervants. And to clo&s;e the &s;cene, he rends from his heart, the dear objects of his affections, by the &s;udden and &s;urprizing death of his children. Thus he tumbles him, in a moment, from the &s;ummit of human glory into the depths of human woe. Here is a fair trial. And what is the effect? Does he cur&s;e God as Satan predicted, and as an unholy, un&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive heart would naturally prompt him to do under &s;uch a &s;evere, corrective &s;troKe? Nothing more remote. "Then Job aro&s;e, and rent his mantle, and &s;haved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and wor&s;hiped, and &s;aid,
<PB N="11" REF="017924_0010_0FA378B08608A1C8">
Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked &s;hall I return thither. The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord." Here is, as far as can be, a vi&s;ible demon&s;tration of the e&s;&s;ential difference between nature and grace, between a &s;aint and a &s;inner.</P>
<P>On another very memorable occa&s;ion, God explicitly acknowledged the reality and importance of this di&s;tinc|tion. He had re&s;olved to de&s;troy Sodom. But pre|viou&s;ly to the execution of this de&s;ign, he revealed his purpo&s;e to Abraham, who immediately breaks forth into the mo&s;t fervent interce&s;&s;ion for tho&s;e mi&s;erable objects. And this is the language in which he addre&s;&s;es the Mo&s;t High. "Wilt thou de&s;troy the righteous with the wicked? That be far from thee to do, after this manner, to &s;lay the righteous with the wicked: And that the righteous &s;hould be as the wicked, that be far from thee, &s;hall not the Judge of all the earth do right? God gra|ciou&s;ly replies to this and his repeated importunity, that if he found fifty, or forty-five, or forty, or thirty, or twenty, or even ten righteous per&s;ons in the city, he would &s;pare the whole place for their &s;akes. And when neither of the&s;e numbers could be found, he delivered ju&s;t Lot, as a &s;tanding monument that the Judge of all the earth would do right. Such are the public, vi&s;ible, &s;triking te&s;timonies, which God him&s;elf hath borne to the di&s;tinction between the righteous and the wicked.</P>
<P>David mentions and de&s;cribes this di&s;tinction almo&s;t in every p&s;alm. It may &s;uffice to quote the fir&s;t as a &s;pe|cimen of the re&s;t. "Ble&s;&s;ed is the man that walketh not in the council of the <HI>ungodly,</HI> nor &s;tandeth in the way of <HI>&s;inners,</HI> nor &s;itteth in the &s;eat of the <HI>&s;cornful.</HI> But his
<PB N="12" REF="017924_0011_0FA378B1454D21C8">
delight is in the law of God; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. And he &s;hall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in &s;ea&s;on; his leaf al&s;o &s;hall not wither, and what|&s;oever he doth &s;hall pro&s;per. The <HI>ungodly are not &s;o:</HI> but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. Therefore the <HI>ungodly &s;hall not &s;tand in the judgment,</HI> nor <HI>&s;inners</HI> in the congregation of the <HI>righteous:</HI> but the way of the <HI>ungodly &s;hall peri&s;h.</HI>" If it be &s;aid, this p&s;alm refers to Chri&s;t, it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve that there is no evi|dence of it from any de&s;cription of his per&s;on or cha|racter, nor from any part of it being applied to him in the new-te&s;tament.</P>
<P>The book of Proverbs is, in a manner, one continued contra&s;t between the righteous and the wicked.</P>
<P>The declarations of Chri&s;t on this head de&s;erve &s;pecial attention and regard. His &s;ermon on the mount con|tains a beautiful de&s;cription of the di&s;criminating charac|ters of the righteous. "Ble&s;&s;ed are the poor in &s;pirit: For theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Ble&s;&s;ed are they that mourn: For they &s;hall be comforted. Ble&s;&s;ed are the meek: For they &s;hall inherit the earth. Ble&s;&s;ed are they which do hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s: For they &s;hall be filled. Ble&s;&s;ed are the merciful: For they &s;hall obtain mercy. Ble&s;&s;ed are the pure in heart: For they &s;hall &s;ee God." That Chri&s;t here intends to di&s;tingui&s;h &s;aints from &s;inners, in re&s;pect to the inward motions and affections of their <HI>hearts,</HI> is not only evident from the de&s;|cription it&s;elf, but from the ob&s;ervation which he imme|diately &s;ubjoins. "For I &s;ay unto you, That except your righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall exceed the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, ye &s;hall in no ca&s;e enter into the
<PB N="13" REF="017924_0012_0FA378B20668EE20">
kingdom of heaven." And in the conclu&s;ion of this chap|ter, he more particularly de&s;cribes the nature and e&s;&s;ence of the di&s;tinction, which he had before been &s;peaking of. "Ye have heard that it hath been &s;aid, Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy: But I &s;ay unto you, Love your enemies, ble&s;s them that cur&s;e you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that de&s;|pitefully u&s;e you, and per&s;ecute you; that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven; for he maketh his &s;un to ri&s;e on the evil and on the good, and &s;endeth rain on the ju&s;t and on the unju&s;t. For if ye love them that love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the &s;ame? And if ye &s;alute your bre|thren only; what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans &s;o? Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." Our Lord here repre&s;ents the children of God as bearing his divine image, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing his divine &s;pirit, which di&s;tingui&s;hes them from the re&s;t of mankind who are utterly de&s;ti|tute of &s;uch a holy and heavenly temper. And in his conference with Nicodemus, he points out the &s;ource from whence they derive this &s;pecial grace, and who it is that makes them to differ. "Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you, Except a man be born again, he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God. That which is born of the fle&s;h, is fle&s;h: and that which is born of the &s;pirit, is &s;pirit: marvel not that I &s;aid unto you, Ye mu&s;t be born again."</P>
<P>We have only to add the te&s;timonies of the apo&s;tles to this important di&s;tinction. St. Paul declares, "If any man have not the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, he is none of his." Again, "If any man be in Chri&s;t, he is a new creature: Old things are pa&s;&s;ed away; behold, all things are be|come new." And he repre&s;ents &s;aints as di&s;tingui&s;hed

not only from &s;inners, but from them&s;elves whil&s;t in a &s;tate of nature, by the &s;pecial influences of the divine Spirit. "And you hath he <HI>quickened,</HI> who were dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, wherein in time pa&s;t ye walked according to the cour&s;e of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the &s;pirit that now work|eth in the children of di&s;obedience: Among whom we all had our conver&s;ation in times pa&s;t; in the lu&s;t of our fle&s;h, and of the mind: And were by nature the chil|dren of wrath, even as others." And in another place, after mentioning a catalogue of the blacke&s;t characters, he reminds the &s;aints, "That &s;uch were &s;ome of you; but ye are wa&s;hed, but ye are &s;anctified, but ye are ju&s;|tified in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, and by the Spirit of our God." The apo&s;tle John in the fir&s;t chapter of his go&s;pel, &s;ays, "As many as received Chri&s;t, to them gave he power to become the &s;ons of God, even to them that believe on his name: Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of the will of man, but of God." And in the third chapter of his fir&s;t epi&s;tle, he in&s;i&s;ts on the &s;ame di&s;tinction as a matter of high importance. "Little children, let no man deceive you (by pretending there is no difference between &s;aints and &s;inners, for) he that doth righteou&s;ne&s;s is righteous, even as he, that is Chri&s;t, is righteous: He that com|mitteth &s;in is of the devil; for the devil &s;inneth from the beginning. Who&s;oever is born of God doth not commit &s;in; for his &s;eed remaineth in him: And he can|not &s;in, becau&s;e he is born of God. In this the children of God are manife&s;t, and the children of the devil: Who&s;oever doth not righteou&s;ne&s;s is not of God. nei|ther he that loveth not his brother." Thus the e&s;&s;ential di&s;tinction between the righteous and the wicked appears to be perfectly con&s;onant to the whole tenor of the &s;acred oracles.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="15" REF="017924_0014_0FA378B3861EB238">III. Chri&s;t further a&s;&s;erts that the righteous and the wicked &s;hall be &s;eperated from each other, and re&s;pec|tively rewarded and puni&s;hed at the la&s;t day. "And he &s;hall &s;eperate them one from another, as &s;hepherd di|videth his &s;heep from the goats: And he &s;hall &s;et the &s;heep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. Then &s;hall the King &s;ay unto them on his right hand; Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. Then &s;hall he &s;ay al&s;o unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels." This repre&s;entation of the proce&s;s of the la&s;t day falls in with the natural apprehen&s;ions of mankind. They naturally expect a future judgment, and they as naturally expect the judgment of God will be according to truth, and proceed upon the immutable principles of perfect rectitude.</P>
<P>And we have &s;ufficient grounds to expect this, from many in&s;tances of the divine conduct. God &s;eperated the fallen angels from the re&s;t of the heavenly ho&s;ts, and doomed them to a &s;tate of darkne&s;s and de&s;pair. He approved and pre&s;erved Noah, whil&s;t he condemned and de&s;troyed the ungodly world. He pre&s;erved ju&s;t Lot from the ruins of Sodom. And he di&s;tingui&s;hed Mo&s;es and Aaron, Caleb and Jo&s;hua from that evil generation, who were doomed to fall in the wilderne&s;s. The&s;e in|&s;tances pre&s;age a more general and perfect di&s;play of re|tributive ju&s;tice at the la&s;t day. And in this light they are con&s;idered and improved by the in&s;pired writers of the new-te&s;tament. The apo&s;tle Peter urges them as inconte&s;tible proofs of future rewards and puni&s;hments. "For, &s;ays he, if God &s;pared not the angels that &s;inned, but ca&s;t them down to hell, and delivered them into
<PB N="16" REF="017924_0015_0FA378B4462038D8">
chains of darkne&s;s, to be re&s;erved unto judgment; and &s;pared not the old world, but &s;aved Noah the eighth per&s;on, a preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly; and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into a&s;hes, condemned them with an overthrow, making them an <HI>en&s;ample</HI> unto tho&s;e that after &s;hould live ungodly; and delivered ju&s;t Lot, vexed with the filthy conver&s;ation of the wicked: &mdash;The Lord knoweth how to deliver the <HI>godly</HI> out of temptations, and to re&s;erve the <HI>unju&s;t unto the day of judg|ment to be puni&s;hed.</HI>" And the apo&s;tle Paul rea&s;ons in the &s;ame manner upon the divine conduct towards the de|voted I&s;raelites. "But with many of them God was not well plea&s;ed; for they were overthrown in the wil|derne&s;s. Now all the&s;e things happened unto them for <HI>en&s;amples</HI>; and they are written for <HI>our admonition,</HI> upon whom the ends of the world are come." The&s;e in&s;tan|ces leave us no room to doubt, that God will finally di&s;|pen&s;e rewards and puni&s;hments to all mankind with per|fect rectitude and impartiality.</P>
<P>Nor is this le&s;s evident from the whole tenor and &s;pi|rit of the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> which &s;ets the rewards of the righteous, and puni&s;hments of the wicked after death, in the cleare&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t light. The go&s;pel not only proclaims di|vine mercy to all penitent and believing &s;inners, but on the contrary, denounces inevitable de&s;truction to all who finally reject the offers of life. Accordingly our Lord, when he &s;ent forth his apo&s;tles to preach the go&s;pel, gave them &s;pecial charge to proclaim its &s;olemn &s;anctions as well as its gracious propo&s;als. "And he called unto him the twelve, and began to &s;end them forth by two and two.&mdash;And he &s;aid unto them, In what place &s;oever ye enter into an hou&s;e, there abide till ye depart from
<PB N="17" REF="017924_0016_0FA378B51642F980">
that place. And who&s;oever &s;hall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, &s;hake off the du&s;t un|der your feet, for a te&s;timony again&s;t them. Verily, I &s;ay unto you, It &s;hall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah, <HI>in the day of judgment,</HI> than for that city." After Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection, and ju&s;t before his a&s;cention into heaven, he gave a commi&s;&s;ion to his apo&s;tles, and to all their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the mini&s;try, to preach the go&s;|pel wherever divine providence &s;hould call them. And their commi&s;&s;ion runs in this &s;olemn form. "Go ye into all the world, and preach the go&s;pel to every creature: He that believeth and is bapti&s;ed &s;hall be &s;aved; but he that believeth not &s;hall be damned." Here is the very genius and &s;pirit of that go&s;pel, which is to be unfolded and inculcated by all the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t in every age of the church. And according to this &s;ummary of the go&s;pel, future rewards and puni&s;hments appear to be not only con&s;i&s;tent with the go&s;pel, but an e&s;&s;ential part of it. Indeed the go&s;pel gives as full a&s;&s;urance of the de&s;truction of unbelievers, as of the &s;alvation of be|lievers; and as infallibly fixes the certainty of future puni&s;hments as of future rewards.</P>
<P>This truth evidently runs through the whole frame and contexture of the go&s;pel, and is interwoven with all its peculiar and leading &s;entiments. We might in|&s;tance in the doctrine of election, divine &s;overeignty, re|generation, &amp;c. But we &s;hall only mention the terms of &s;alvation, which are the cardinal precepts of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Repentance is one of the&s;e. It is much in&s;i&s;ted on both in the old te&s;tament and new. Solomon &s;ays, "He that covereth his &s;ins &s;hall not pro&s;per: But who&s;o con|fe&s;&s;eth
<PB N="18" REF="017924_0017_0FA378B6346AD2C0">
and for&s;aketh them, &s;hall have mercy." David tells us, "The &s;acrifices of God are a broken &s;pirit: A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not de&s;|pi&s;e." Chri&s;t al&s;o declares, "He came not to call the righteous, but &s;inners to repentance. And he expre&s;ly told &s;inners, on a certain occa&s;ion, "Except ye repent, ye &s;hall all likewi&s;e peri&s;h."</P>
<P>Faith in the Mediator is a term of the divine accep|tance. "He that believeth and is bapti&s;ed &s;hall be &s;aved: But he that believeth not &s;hall be damned."</P>
<P>Love to Chri&s;t is a condition of divine approbation at the la&s;t day. "If any man love not the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, let him be Anathama maranatha." That is to &s;ay, let him be accur&s;ed when the Lord cometh to judgment.</P>
<P>A forgiving &s;pirit is likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary in order to ob|tain divine forgivene&s;s. "When ye &s;tand praying for|give if ye have ought again&s;t any: That your Father al&s;o, which is in heaven, may forgive your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es. But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es."</P>
<P>And it is equally nece&s;&s;ary to per&s;evere in all chri&s;tian graces and duties, in order to receive the end of our faith, even the &s;alvation of our &s;ouls. "Now the ju&s;t &s;hall live by faith: But if any man draw back, my &s;oul &s;hall have no plea&s;ure in him. But we are not of tho&s;e who draw back unto perdition: But of them that believe to the &s;aving of their &s;ouls." The&s;e terms of &s;alvation &s;peak for them&s;elves. If they have any meaning, they mu&s;t mean that tho&s;e who comply with them &s;hall be &s;aved; but tho&s;e who reject them &s;hall be lo&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="017924_0018_0FA378B685F6B008">The doctrine of future rewards and puni&s;hments may receive additional proof from many expre&s;s declarations of &s;cripture. To recite every pa&s;&s;age in favour of this truth, would be to tran&s;cribe a great part of the bible. We &s;hall therefore only mention a few which are the mo&s;t plain, and pertinent to our &s;ubject. We read in the ninth p&s;alm, "The wicked &s;hall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God." There was a &s;et of men, in the days of Malachi, who ridiculed all expe|rimental religion and vital piety. They &s;aid it was a vain thing to &s;erve God, to walk mournfully before him, or to keep his ordinances. They called the proud hap|py, and applauded the workers of iniquity. In contra&s;t with &s;uch per&s;ons, the prophet points the characters and future pro&s;pects of the righteous in the mo&s;t lively co|lours. "Then they that feared the Lord &s;pake often one to a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">her; and the Lord hearkened and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him, for them that feared the Lord and thought upon his name. And they &s;hall be mine, &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts, in the day when I make up my jewels; and I will &s;pare them as a man &s;pareth his own &s;on that &s;erveth him. Then &s;hall ye return, and di&s;cern between the righteous and the wicked; between him that &s;erveth God, and him that &s;erveth him not."</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle Paul &s;peaks equally plain and determinate on this head, in the &s;econd chapter of Romans. "But we are &s;ure the judgment of God is according to truth, again&s;t them that commit &s;uch things. And thinke&s;t thou, O man, that judge&s;t tho&s;e that do &s;uch things and doe&s;t the &s;ame, that thou &s;halt e&s;cape the judgment of God? Or de&s;pi&s;e&s;t thou the riches of his goodne&s;s, and forbearance, and long &s;uffering; not knowing that the
<PB N="20" REF="017924_0019_0FA378B747BAD220">
goodne&s;s of God leadeth thee to repentance? But after thy hardne&s;s and impenitent heart, trea&s;ure&s;t up to thy|&s;elf wrath, again&s;t the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; who &s;hall render to every man according to his deeds: To them, who by patient continuance in well doing, &s;eek for glory, and honor, and immortality; eternal life: But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteou&s;ne&s;s; indignation and wrath, tribulation and angui&s;h upon every <HI>&s;oul</HI> of man (not &s;in of man, but <HI>&s;oul</HI> of man) that doth evil, of the Jew fir&s;t, and al&s;o of the Gentile."</P>
<P>To the&s;e may be added the declarations of Chri&s;t. "Wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to de&s;truction, and many there be which go in thereat: Becau&s;e &s;trait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it." "Not every one that &s;aith unto me, Lord, Lord, &s;hall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Many will &s;ay unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophe&s;ied in thy name? And in thy name ca&s;t out devils? And in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profe&s;s unto them, I never knew you: Depart from me, <HI>ye that work iniquity.</HI>" "Fear not them that kill the body, but are not able to kill the &s;oul: But rather fear him, which is able to de&s;troy both &s;oul and body in hell."</P>
<P>To enforce the&s;e &s;olemn warnings, our compa&s;&s;ionate Redeemer, as it were, &s;ets before our eyes the certainty and danger of future puni&s;hments, by a number of well-cho&s;en and &s;triking parables. To this end he &s;poke the parable of the vineyard&mdash;of the &s;ower&mdash;of the rich fool
<PB N="21" REF="017924_0020_0FA378B8064BC930">
&mdash;of the marriage &s;upper&mdash;of the ten virgins&mdash;of the ta|lents&mdash;of the tares&mdash;and of the rich man and Lazarus. Each of the&s;e parables would greatly &s;erve to illu&s;trate the &s;ubject before us, but e&s;pecially the two la&s;t; which, therefore, we beg leave to recite at large. The parable of the tares is in the thirteenth of Matthew. "The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which &s;owed good &s;eed in his field: But while men &s;lept, his enemy came and &s;owed tares among the wheat, and went his way. But when the blade was &s;prung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares al&s;o. So the &s;ervants of the hou&s;holder came, and &s;aid unto him, Sir, did&s;t not thou &s;ow good &s;eed in thy field? From whence then hath it tares? He &s;aid unto them, an enemy hath done this. The &s;ervants &s;aid unto him, Wilt thou that we go and gather them up? But he &s;aid, nay; le&s;t while ye ga|ther up the tares, ye root up al&s;o the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harve&s;t: And in the time of harve&s;t, I will &s;ay unto the reapers, Gather ye together fir&s;t the tares, and bind them in bundles, to burn them: But gather the wheat into my barn." Our Lord's expo&s;ition of his own parable &s;uper&s;edes any other comment. It is this. "He that &s;oweth the good &s;eed is the Son of man; the field is the world; the good &s;eed are the children of the kingdom, but the tares are the children of the wicked one: The enemy that &s;owed them is the devil; the harve&s;t is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. As therefore the tares are gathered and burnt in the fire; &s;o &s;hall it be in the end of the world. The Son of man &s;hall &s;end forth his angels, and they &s;hall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and <HI>them which</HI> do iniquity: And &s;hall ca&s;t <HI>them</HI> (not their <HI>&s;ins,</HI> but them per&s;onally) into a furnace of fire: There &s;hall be weeping and kna&s;hing
<PB N="22" REF="017924_0021_0FA378B8C6137350">
of teeth. Then &s;hall the righteous &s;hine forth in the kingdom of their Father."</P>
<P>The parable of the rich man and Lazarus, in the &s;ix|teenth of Luke, gives us a &s;till more vi&s;ible and affecting repre&s;entation of the mi&s;eries of the damned. "There was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared &s;umptuou&s;ly every day. And there was a certain beggar, named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of &s;ores; and de&s;iring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: Moreover the dogs came and licked his &s;ores. And it came to pa&s;s that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bo&s;om. The rich man al&s;o died, and was buried: And in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in tor|ments, and &s;eeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bo&s;om. And he cried and &s;aid, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and &s;end Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue: For I am tormented in this flame. But Abraham &s;aid, Son, remember that thou in thy life-time received&s;t thy good things, and likewi&s;e Lazarus evil things: But now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. And be&s;ides all this, between us and you there is a great gulph fixed: So that they which would pa&s;s from hence to you, can|not, neither can they pa&s;s to us, that would come from thence. Then he &s;aid, I pray thee therefore that thou woulde&s;t &s;end him to my father's hou&s;e; for I have five brethren, that he may te&s;tify unto them, le&s;t they al&s;o come into this place of torment. Abraham &s;aith unto him, They have Mo&s;es and the prophets: Let them hear them. And he &s;aid, nay, Father Abraham; but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent. And he &s;aid unto him, if they hear not Mo&s;es and the pro|phets,
<PB N="23" REF="017924_0022_0FA378B986373F60">
neither will they be per&s;uaded though one ri&s;e from the dead." Nothing &s;hort of dreadful experience can give us clearer evidence of future torments than this parable; nor afford a better comment upon our Lord's repre&s;entation of the final &s;eperation between the righteous and the wicked, and their re&s;pective rewards and puni&s;hments at the la&s;t day.</P>
<P>There is one thing more contained in the text, which de&s;erves particular notice, and that is,</P>
<P N="4">IV. The endle&s;s duration of future rewards and pu|ni&s;hments. "Then &s;hall he &s;ay al&s;o unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. And the&s;e &s;hall go away into <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> puni&s;hment: But the righteous into life <HI>eternal.</HI>" This is the general voice of &s;cripture. The prophet Daniel &s;ays, "Many of them that &s;leep in the du&s;t of the earth &s;hall awake, &s;ome to <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> life, and &s;ome to &s;hame, and <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> contempt." The apo&s;tle Paul a&s;&s;erts, that "the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hall be revealed from heaven, with his mighty angels, in flam|ing fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: Who &s;hall be puni&s;hed with <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power." In Rev. 20th, 3d, the apo&s;tle John tells us, "He &s;aw Satan ca&s;t into the <HI>bottomle&s;s</HI> pit." This epi|thet, which we meet with no le&s;s than &s;ix times be&s;ides in this book. expre&s;&s;es in the &s;tronge&s;t manner the never|ending mi&s;eries of the wicked, the &s;moke of who&s;e tor|ments is repeatedly &s;aid to a&s;cend forever and ever. Our Lord once before a&s;&s;erted the eternity of future pu|ni&s;hments as clearly as he does in the text. "If thy hand offend thee cut it off: It is better for thee to enter
<PB N="24" REF="017924_0023_0FA378BA44FBBDD8">
into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never &s;hall be quenched: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: It is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be ca&s;t into hell, into the fire that never &s;hall be quenched: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: It is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be ca&s;t into hell-fire: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched." In this la&s;t pa&s;&s;age the eternity of hell-torments is expre&s;&s;ed in terms which admit of no eva&s;ion. Our Lord's argu|ment here turns upon the infinite di&s;parity between tem|poral and eternal pains. Duration is the only point to be illu&s;trated. And finite is here &s;et in contra&s;t with in|finite duration. And this infinite duration is expre&s;&s;ed by a variety of epithets, which are, of all others, the mo&s;t plain, determinate and unexceptionable.</P>
<P>As to the words&mdash;eternal&mdash;everla&s;ting&mdash;forever and ever&mdash;they generally &s;ignify a duration which is ab&s;o|lutely boundle&s;s, and are to be taken &s;o here, unle&s;s there be &s;ome &s;pecial rea&s;on for re&s;tricting them to a limited duration. When they are applied to &s;ubjects which are in their <HI>own nature temporary</HI>; this naturally leads us to under&s;tand them in a limited and re&s;tricted &s;en&s;e. But when they are applied to the &s;ouls of men which are immortal, the &s;ubject allows us to interpret them in their mo&s;t common and exten&s;ive meaning. The &s;ouls of the wicked may exi&s;t as long as the &s;ouls of the righteous, and therefore the mi&s;eries of the former may run paral|lel with the happine&s;s of the latter. And this is a&s;&s;erted in the text. The &s;ame word in the original is u&s;ed to
<PB N="25" REF="017924_0024_0FA378BB05B793C8">
expre&s;s the duration of future puni&s;hments, which is u&s;ed to expre&s;s the duration of future rewards. "And the&s;e &s;hall go away into <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> puni&s;hment: But the righteous into life <HI>eternal.</HI>" The Greek word here ren|dered eternal and everla&s;ting, is rendered &s;o fifty-&s;even times in the new-te&s;tament; and there are but two places in the new-te&s;tament, where the word eternal or everla&s;ting comes from any other Greek word. The &s;ame Greek word is likewi&s;e u&s;ed both in the old and new te&s;tament, to &s;ignify the eternity of the divine ex|i&s;tence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Gen. 22, 23.

And though Mr. Seigvolk and others &s;ay, the Greek words which the in&s;pired writers here made u&s;e of to expre&s;s the eternity of future puni&s;hments, only &s;ignify <HI>an age, or ages, or ages of ages, or periodical eternities of</HI> 50, 100, 1000, 2000 <HI>years continuance,</HI> yet they do not tell us what other words could have been u&s;ed to expre&s;s an ab&s;olute eter|nity with more certainty and preci&s;ion, or more to their &s;atisfaction.

writers had really intended to a&s;&s;ert the endle&s;s duration of future puni&s;hments, they could not have done it, be|cau&s;e there is no word in any language, which primarily &s;ignifies an ab&s;olute eternity. But the&s;e and all other critics, however, are obliged to own, that the in&s;pired writers have u&s;ed &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as <HI>&s;ometimes &s;ignify eternity,</HI> and acknowledge that the &s;en&s;e of &s;uch expre&s;|&s;ions ought to be determined by the nature of the &s;ub|jects to which they applied, and the connection in which they are u&s;ed. Hence there appears no force in the critici&s;ms which have been made upon the words, by which the eternity of future puni&s;hments is expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;acred oracles. So far as words, or mere expre&s;&s;ions can determine the matter, it is ab&s;olutely certain, that both the mi&s;eries of the wicked, and the happine&s;s of the righteous will run parallel with the interminable ages of eternity.</P>
<P>Nor is there any thing in &s;cripture or rea&s;on to take off the force of the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, or lead us to imagine the wicked will ever be relea&s;ed from puni&s;hment and re&s;tored to the divine favour.</P>
<P N="1">1. We have no rea&s;on to think &s;o from the nature of &s;in. All allow that &s;in and guilt are in&s;eperably con|nected, and therefore that every &s;in de&s;erves <HI>&s;ome</HI> pu|ni&s;hment. But many imagine, that no tran&s;ient, mo|mentary act of a finite creature can contain &s;uch malig|nity and guilt, as to de&s;erve an <HI>eternal</HI> puni&s;hment; and therefore that the damned mu&s;t finally be relea&s;ed from puni&s;hment, upon the foot of equity, having paid the uttermo&s;t farthing which they owed to divine ju&s;tice. And if their guilt &s;hall ever cea&s;e, we may be a&s;&s;ured their puni&s;hment will al&s;o cea&s;e, for the Judge of all the
<PB N="27" REF="017924_0026_0FA378BC8A2A91D0">
earth will do right, and puni&s;h them no longer than they de&s;erve. But who, in the whole circle of the intelli|gent creation, can tell us when their guilt, or de&s;ert of puni&s;hment will cea&s;e? <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>guilt</HI> are in&s;eperably connected. <HI>Guilt</HI> can no more be &s;eperated from &s;in than <HI>criminality.</HI> There is no &s;in without criminality, and no criminality without guilt, or de&s;ert of puni&s;hment. Therefore both the criminality and guilt of a crime mu&s;t continue as long as the crime continues, or till it cea&s;es to be a crime and becomes an innocent action. But can murder, for in&s;tance, which is a crime in the very na|ture of things, ever become a virtue? Can time, or obe|dience, or &s;ufferings, or even a divine declaration, alter its nature, and render it an innocent action? Virtue and vice, &s;in and holine&s;s are founded in the nature of things, and &s;o mu&s;t forever remain immutable. Hence that which was once virtuous, will forever be virtuous; that which was once vicious, will forever be vicious; that which was once prai&s;e-worthy, will forever be prai&s;e-worthy; that which was once blame-worthy, will for|ever be blame-worthy; and that which once de&s;erved puni&s;hment, will forever de&s;erve puni&s;hment. Now if neither the nature of &s;in can be changed, nor the guilt of it taken away, then the damned, who have once de|&s;erved puni&s;hment, will forever de&s;erve it, and con&s;e|quently God may, in point of ju&s;tice, puni&s;h them to all eternity.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is no ground to expect that the puni&s;hments of the damned will ever &s;often and purify their hearts, and &s;o prepare them, in &s;ome di&s;tant period, to exchange the regions of darkne&s;s for the man&s;ions of bli&s;s. Among others Dr. Hartley and Chevalier Ram&s;ay build their &s;tronge&s;t hopes of the final re&s;titution of all lap&s;ed beings
<PB N="28" REF="017924_0027_0FA378BD45703258">
to the divine favor, upon this foundation. They ima|gine the puni&s;hments of the wicked will naturally &s;often and meliorate their hearts, and finally qualify them for the &s;ociety and enjoyments of the ble&s;&s;ed. They &s;up|po&s;e God's ultimate view in puni&s;hing the wicked after death is to reclaim them, and bring them to good. They look upon &s;uch per&s;ons as die in impenitence and unbe|lief as peculiarly <HI>perver&s;e</HI> and <HI>obaurate,</HI> whom none of the mild methods of providence and grace could ef|fectually &s;ubdue and reclaim in this life, and therefore God is reduced to the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of purging and purifying them by the har&s;h and &s;evere means of hell-torments. They imagine God con&s;tantly de&s;ires and uniformly pur&s;ues the happine&s;s of every individual of the human race, and will bring them all to pure and permanent felicity as &s;oon as he can po&s;&s;ibly do it con|&s;i&s;tent with <HI>their moral freedom</HI> and <HI>inveterate habits</HI> of &s;in. And "as God cannot be eternally fru&s;trated in his de&s;igns; as finite impotence, folly and malice cannot forever &s;ur|mount infinite power, wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s; as the &s;a|crifice of the Lamb &s;lain cannot be forever void and of no effect; reprobate &s;ouls and angels cannot be forever unconvertible, nor God unappea&s;eable, nor moral and phy&s;ical evil unde&s;tructible. Wherefore infernal pu|ni&s;hments mu&s;t at la&s;t cea&s;e, and all lap&s;ed beings be at length pardoned and re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in a permanent &s;tate of happine&s;s and glory, never more to fall again. This is the end and con&s;ummation of all things, and the de&s;igns of all God's promi&s;es and puni&s;hments."</P>
<P>But is there any thing in divine revelation to &s;upport this hypothe&s;is? That God vi&s;its the righteous, in this life, with pains, trials and afflictions for their <HI>&s;piritual benefit,</HI> he hath expre&s;ly told us, and they have &s;ound
<PB N="29" REF="017924_0028_0FA378BE0616D298">
to be true by happy experience. "My &s;on, de&s;pi&s;e not the cha&s;tening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art re|buked of him. For whom the Lord loveth he cha&s;ten|eth, and &s;courgeth every &s;on whom he receiveth. Fur|thermore, we have had fathers of our fle&s;h, which cor|rected us, and we gave them reverence: Shall we not much rather be in &s;ubjection unto the father of our &s;pi|rits, and live? For they verily for a few days cha&s;tened us after their own plea&s;ure; but he for our <HI>profit,</HI> that we might be partakers of <HI>his holine&s;s.</HI>" And David grate|fully acknowledges that he derived real benefit from the divine corrections. "Before I was afflicted, I went a|&s;tray; but now have I kept thy word. I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are right, and thou in faithfulne&s;s hath corrected me." Thus God lets his children know the &s;alutary nature of his fatherly cha&s;ti&s;ements. But where do we find the lea&s;t intimation in &s;cripture, that God intends to puni&s;h the wicked in a future &s;tate, for their <HI>benefit,</HI> as he here corrects his children for their &s;piritual good: Hath he not, on the contrary expre&s;ly a&s;&s;ured the wicked, that he intends to puni&s;h them, after death, not to <HI>&s;ave,</HI> but <HI>de&s;troy</HI> them, not to expre&s;s his love towards them, but his indignation and wrath? This is the plain import of the &s;entence to be denounced again&s;t them at the la&s;t day. "Depart from me ye <HI>cur&s;ed,</HI> into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his an|gels." "Vengeance is mine, and I will repay, &s;aith the Lord." "If I whet my glittering &s;word, and mine hand take hold of judgment; I will render <HI>vengeance</HI> to mine <HI>enemies,</HI> and will reward them that <HI>hate</HI> me." "What if God, <HI>willing to &s;hew his wrath,</HI> and make his power known, endured with much long &s;uffering the <HI>ve&s;&s;els of wrath fitted to de&s;truction.</HI>" Here the wicked after death are repre&s;ented as the <HI>enemies</HI> of God, and as the objects
<PB N="30" REF="017924_0029_0FA378BEC63850D0">
of his wrath; and he is repre&s;ented as puni&s;hing them to <HI>reward</HI> them for their wickedne&s;s, and to expre&s;s his wrath and di&s;plea&s;ure towards them, without the lea&s;t regard to their amendment and benefit. But if future puni&s;hments were intended as fatherly cha&s;ti&s;ements to purify the wicked, and qualify them for the eternal joys of heaven, why are they then repre&s;ented as expre&s;&s;ive of divine wrath, indignation and vengeance, in&s;tead of the tender mercy of God towards his offending but be|loved offspring? The truth is, the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions put it beyond doubt, that God has diametrically oppo&s;ite ends in cha&s;ti&s;ing the righteous in this life, and puni&s;hing the wicked in the next. And we may be a&s;&s;ured God can and will make his own <HI>means</HI> an&s;wer his own <HI>ends.</HI> As he de&s;igns future puni&s;hments &s;hall not <HI>&s;often,</HI> but <HI>harden,</HI> &s;hall not <HI>&s;ave</HI> but <HI>de&s;troy</HI> the wicked; &s;o they will even|tually have this, and no other effect upon them. Ac|cordingly, we find this confirmed by the mo&s;t inconte&s;|tible evidence. A puni&s;hment of near &s;ix thou&s;and years continuance hath hitherto, in no mea&s;ure, &s;ubdued or &s;oftened the heart of Satan, who &s;till remains an avowed and malignant enemy to God and man. The &s;ignal plagues &s;ent in rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion on Pharaoh, in&s;tead of &s;oftening, <HI>hardened</HI> his &s;tubborn heart, and made him &s;e|ven fold more a ve&s;&s;el of wrath fitted to de&s;truction, ac|cording to the divine <HI>purpo&s;e</HI> and <HI>prediction</HI> concerning him. And the tremendous judgments which fell on the &s;ubjects of Satan's kingdom, at &s;he pouring out of the &s;ixth vial had the &s;ame <HI>hardening</HI> effect and impre&s;&s;ion on their impenitent hearts. "The fifth angel poured out his vial upon the &s;eat of the bea&s;t: And his kingdom was full of darkne&s;s, and they knawed their tongues for pain, and bla&s;phemed the God of heaven, becau&s;e of their pains and their &s;ores, and <HI>repented not of their deeds.</HI>"
<PB N="31" REF="017924_0030_0FA378BF860E2008">
Hence we are to conclude that the vials of divine wrath to be poured on the enemies of Chri&s;t at the la&s;t day, in&s;tead of &s;oftening and meliorating their hearts, will only &s;erve to confirm and increa&s;e their malignant di&s;|po&s;itions, to render them more odious to God, and more unmeet for the &s;ociety and enjoyments of the ble&s;|&s;ed: And being thus eternally unqualified for heaven, they will never find admi&s;&s;ion into tho&s;e realms of love and unpolluted bli&s;s. Be&s;ides,</P>
<P N="3">3. There is no intimation in the word of God, that tho&s;e who are once &s;eperated from the righteous at the la&s;t day, &s;hall ever be united to them again. Our text and many other pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture clearly a&s;certain the time, manner and rea&s;on of the &s;eperation between the righteous and the wicked, but there is not a text to be found, which intimates when, how, or for what rea&s;on they &s;hall be re-united. Every repre&s;entation of the ge|neral judgment naturally leads us to &s;uppo&s;e, that God will then finally &s;ettle all the affairs of mankind, and ir|rever&s;ably fix their characters and conditions for eterni|ty. Accordingly none of the mo&s;t able writers, that we have met with, in favour of the final happine&s;s of all lap&s;ed beings, have pre&s;umed to tell us <HI>when</HI> this impor|tant event &s;hall take place, or the mi&s;eries of the damned &s;hall cea&s;e. But if God intended to relea&s;e them, one would imagine, that he would have made it known in his word, and relieved them from that intolerable de&s;|pair, to which they may now be liable for ages of ages. Why &s;hould be &s;o particularly fix, and reveal, and de&s;|cribe the day when their puni&s;hments &s;hall commence, but never give the lea&s;t hint concerning the time and circum&s;tances of their relea&s;e? Is not this bare &s;ilence a &s;trong pre&s;umption that they &s;hall never be relea&s;ed, and a

full demon&s;tration that no man can <HI>prove</HI> that they ever will?</P>
<P>N. B. This Di&s;cour&s;e may be divided here.</P>
<P>NOW if the above ob&s;ervations have fully e&s;tabli&s;hed the eternity of future puni&s;hments, then we are obliged to believe the doctrine, whether we can an&s;wer all the objections made again&s;t it, or not. It would be very ab&s;urd for a man to deny his own exi&s;tence, the exi&s;tence of his fellow creatures, and the earth's annual productions of herbs, fruits and flowers, becau&s;e, after all his philo&s;ophical re&s;earches, he is unable to inve&s;tigate the <HI>mode</HI> of the divine operation in creation and provi|dence. And it is equally a &s;urd to di&s;believe the being of God, the in&s;piration of the &s;criptures, or the <HI>eternity</HI> of future puni&s;hments, becau&s;e there may be &s;ome things connected with the&s;e &s;ubjects, which lie beyond the &s;phere of human comprehen&s;ion. It is not the intention of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, however, to preclude an examina|tion of any objections that may be urged again&s;t the eternity of hell-torments, or any other doctrine of the go&s;pel; or to in&s;inuate that we are bound to believe real contradictions and ab&s;urdities; but only to prepare the mind to look at the difficulties which we propo&s;e to con&s;ider, with candour and impartiality; and lead us to re&s;t our faith upon the firm foundation of real evidence.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that
<Q>by the &s;eperation between the &s;heep and the goats in the text, is not to be under&s;tood a &s;e|peration between &s;aints and &s;inners, but only a &s;epera|tion between <HI>&s;in</HI> and the <HI>&s;inner.</HI> The <HI>&s;ins</HI> of men &s;hall be &s;eperated from their <HI>per&s;ons,</HI> and their per&s;ons &s;hall be &s;aved, whil&s;t their &s;ins, and the father of them, the

<P>To &s;uppo&s;e that mankind were "with Chri&s;t through all the circum&s;tances of his birth, life, death, re&s;urrec|tion and glory," is repugnant to the plaine&s;t dictates of common &s;en&s;e. Chri&s;t was born of the virgin Mary; was circumci&s;ed the eighth day; was, at thirty years old, baptized of John in Jordan; was, after this, led into the wilderne&s;s, where he fa&s;ted forty days and forty nights, and baffled all the devices of Satan; and being thus prepared, he went forth preaching the go&s;pel, heal|ing the &s;ick, ca&s;ting out devils and rai&s;ing the dead; till finally, he was betrayed by Judas, condemned by Pilate, crucified between two malefactors, buried by Jo&s;eph of Arimathea, and after lying three days and three nights in the grave, he aro&s;e from the dead, a&s;|cended up into heaven, and &s;et down on the right hand of the Maje&s;ty on high. Were any, much le&s;s, the whole human race with Chri&s;t in all the&s;e circum&s;tances of his birth, life, death, re&s;urrection and glory? Where is the man who is con&s;cious of being, acting, and &s;uf|fering with Chri&s;t in any of the&s;e extraordinary and &s;tu|pendous
<PB N="36" REF="017924_0035_0FA378C3470ED2E0">
&s;cenes? But had there been &s;uch an union be|tween Chri&s;t and mankind, that his obedience was theirs, his &s;ufferings theirs, and his glory theirs, they mu&s;t all, in every age of the world, be con&s;cious of having the &s;ame motives, the &s;ame affections, the &s;ame &s;orrows, and the &s;ame joys that he had; and of doing the &s;ame miraculous actions that he did. But what con|cord had Chri&s;t with Belial? What union of heart with an ungodly world? Was he not pure, and harmle&s;s, and <HI>&s;eperate</HI> from &s;inners, through the whole cour&s;e of his life and conduct upon earth?</P>
<P>It may, perhaps, be &s;aid that this is an unfair repre|&s;entation of the matter, and that by "Chri&s;t's being in mankind, and they being in him," is only intended, that according to a certain divine con&s;titution, God con|&s;iders what Chri&s;t did and &s;uffered as being done and &s;uf|fered by mankind per&s;onally. The an&s;wer to this is obvious. No divine con&s;titution or appointment what|ever, could make Chri&s;t's per&s;onal obedience and &s;uffer|ings ours. A divine con&s;titution cannot alter the nature of things, nor effect impo&s;&s;ibilities. Can we conceive that it is now in the power of the Supreme Being, by a new, po&s;itive con&s;titution, to make Chri&s;t the betrayer of Judas, the crucifier of his crucifiers, and the perpe|trator of all the &s;in and wickedne&s;s of the whole human race? But it is no more impo&s;&s;ible for God to do this now, than it was from eternity, to make a con&s;titution, by which, not only the actions of Chri&s;t and of Judas, but the actions of Chri&s;t and of all mankind &s;hould be the &s;ame. The &s;uppo&s;ition of a divine con&s;titution relieves no difficulty here. The notion that all mankind were "with Chri&s;t through all the circum&s;tances of his birth, life, death, re&s;urrection and glory," is as ab&s;urd as the
<PB N="37" REF="017924_0036_0FA378C4050B07E8">
doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, of which no man can form an idea.</P>
<P>And be&s;ides all this, it is entirely un&s;criptural. It is not to be found among any of the unions which are mentioned in the bible. We there find indeed the union between the human and divine natures in the per&s;on of the Mediator. Chri&s;t often a&s;&s;erted both his humanity and divinity. He proclaimed him&s;elf not only the Son of Man, but the Son of God; and profe&s;&s;ed to be not only David's Son, but David's Lord. Accordingly, the Jews, who under&s;tood the true import of &s;uch phra&s;es, con&s;idered him as a&s;&s;uming divinity and equality with God the Father; for which they accu&s;ed him of the crime of bla&s;phemy. And our Lord, to vindicate him|&s;elf, never denied, but maintained his claim to the la&s;t; which claim was founded upon the union between his human and divine nature. Hence the apo&s;tle John tells us, "The word was made fle&s;h and dwelt among&s;t us." And we read, "Great is the my&s;tery of godline&s;s; God manife&s;t in the fle&s;h." Such an union of the two natures in the per&s;on of Chri&s;t, was nece&s;&s;ary to qualify him for the work of redemption. For the divine nature &s;epe|rately con&s;idered, could neither &s;uffer, nor obey; and the human nature &s;eperate from the divine, could not atone by obedience and death; but both the&s;e natures being united in the per&s;on of Chri&s;t compleatly qualified him for the mediatorial work. Be&s;ides, this union was al&s;o requi&s;ite in order to point out the objects for whom he made atonement. He would appear to die for tho&s;e, in who&s;e nature he died. Had he took upon him the nature of angels, and died in their nature, this would have proclaimed him the Mediator betweeen God and <HI>them.</HI> But ina&s;much as he did not take upon him the
<PB N="38" REF="017924_0037_0FA378C4C55A1248">
nature of angels, but that of the &s;eed of Abraham, this proclaimed him the Mediator between God and <HI>man.</HI> Now if Mr. Relly had only a&s;&s;erted the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch an union as this, in order to render the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t in the room of mankind, con&s;i&s;tent with the di|vine attributes, we &s;hould have had no di&s;po&s;ition to di&s;&s;ent from him. For we grant it would have been incon&s;i&s;tent with the divine truth, ju&s;tice, mercy, wi&s;|dom and love, to have &s;ubjected Chri&s;t to tho&s;e &s;uffer|ings which he endured in the room of &s;inners, had he not been united to human nature, and &s;o become the Mediator between God and man. But Mr. Relly over|looking this union between Chri&s;t and <HI>innocent</HI> human nature, maintains that Chri&s;t was <HI>united</HI> to <HI>&s;inful man, and partook of their guilt,</HI> and on that account <HI>de&s;erved</HI> to &s;uffer, in point of <HI>ju&s;tice.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 3, 4, 5, 6.</NOTE> In this view indeed, the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t appear perfectly ju&s;t, but not in the lea&s;t degree <HI>meritorious,</HI> for there can be no <HI>merit</HI> in &s;uf|fering a <HI>ju&s;t puni&s;hment.</HI> So that had it been po&s;&s;ible for &s;uch an union to have exi&s;ted as Mr. Relly pleads for, it would have defeated the ends of Chri&s;t's death, and prevented an atonement for &s;in.</P>
<P>The &s;cripture likewi&s;e mentions an union between Chri&s;t and the <HI>elect.</HI> A certain number of mankind were cho&s;en to &s;alvation from eternity, and given to Chri&s;t, in the covenant of redemption, as the reward of his &s;ufferings. The&s;e are called the <HI>elect,</HI> or the <HI>church,</HI> and often alluded to in &s;cripture, particularly in the fol|lowing pa&s;&s;ages. "Ble&s;&s;ed be the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who hath ble&s;&s;ed us with all &s;pi|ritual ble&s;&s;ings in heavenly places <HI>in Chri&s;t</HI>; according as he hath cho&s;en us <HI>in him,</HI> before the foundation of
<PB N="39" REF="017924_0038_0FA378C5846A14C8">
the world, that we &s;hould be holy and without blame before him in love." "Be thou partaker of the afflic|tions of the go&s;pel, according to the power of God; who hath &s;aved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpo&s;e and grace, which was given us <HI>in Chri&s;t,</HI> before the world began." "Ye al&s;o, as living &s;tones, are built up a <HI>&s;piritual hou&s;e,</HI> an <HI>holy prie&s;thood,</HI> to offer up &s;piritual &s;acrifices, acceptable to God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Where|fore al&s;o it is contained in the &s;cripture, behold I lay in Zion a <HI>chief corner &s;tone, elect precious</HI>; and he that be|lieveth on him &s;hall not be confounded. Unto you therefore, who believe, he is precious: But unto them who are di&s;obedient, the &s;tone which the builders di&s;al|lowed, the &s;ame is made the <HI>head of the corner</HI>; and a &s;tone of &s;tumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them who &s;tumble at the word, being di&s;obedient, <HI>whereunto al&s;o they were appointed.</HI> But ye are a <HI>cho&s;en</HI> generation, a royal <HI>prie&s;thood,</HI> an <HI>holy nation,</HI> a <HI>peculiar</HI> people." The&s;e, and many other pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture &s;peak of the <HI>elect,</HI> and &s;peak of them as <HI>peculiar,</HI> and <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> from the re&s;t of mankind. All the world are not the elect, but the elect are tho&s;e who from eternity were cho&s;en out of the world, and who are repre&s;ented in &s;cripture, as entirely di&s;tinct from the world. Our Lord hath taken care to fix and determine this matter with great preci&s;ion. He &s;ays in the 24th of Matthew, "And many fal&s;e prophets &s;hall ari&s;e, and &s;hall <HI>deceive many,</HI> and &s;hall &s;hew great &s;igns and wonders, in&s;omuch that (if it were po&s;&s;ible) they &s;hall deceive the very <HI>elect</HI>" Here the elect are di&s;tinct from the <HI>many</HI> that were to be deceived. Again, in the 15th of John, Chri&s;t tells his followers, "If the <HI>world</HI> hate you, ye know it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would
<PB N="40" REF="017924_0039_0FA378C6460F5C70">
love his own: But becau&s;e ye are not of the world, but I have <HI>cho&s;en</HI> you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you." In the 17th chapter, he hath the&s;e ex|pre&s;&s;ions. "I have manife&s;ted thy name unto the men which thou gave&s;t me <HI>out of the world.</HI> I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, <HI>becau&s;e they are not of the world,</HI> even as I am not of the world."</P>
<P>Now as the elect were cho&s;en to &s;alvation from eter|nity, <HI>in Chri&s;t,</HI> as the means, and <HI>for Chri&s;t,</HI> as the reward of his &s;ufferings and death; &s;o it may be truly &s;aid, that there hath been a certain <HI>union or connection</HI> between Chri&s;t and the elect <HI>from eternity.</HI> But be&s;ides this, there is another more intimate and <HI>vital</HI> union between Chri&s;t and the elect, which commences <HI>in time</HI>; but &s;hall en|dure forever. For whom God prede&s;tinates, them he al&s;o calls; and whom he calls, them he al&s;o ju&s;tifies; and whom he ju&s;tifies, them he al&s;o glorifies. Hence, &s;ays, the apo&s;tle, &s;peaking of the &s;ucce&s;s of his labours among the Gentiles, "<HI>As many as were ordained to eternal life, believed.</HI>" All the elect are brought in this life, by the influences of the divine Spirit, to repentance and <HI>faith.</HI> And <HI>in faith,</HI> this vital union to Chri&s;t com|mences. The believer then becomes united to Chri&s;t <HI>in his affections, views,</HI> and <HI>intere&s;ts.</HI> He loves what Chri&s;t loves, and hates what Chri&s;t hates. He has the &s;ame views of the divine Maje&s;ty, of the divine law, of &s;in, and of him&s;elf, that Chri&s;t has. And he has a joint intere&s;t with Chri&s;t in the love of God, in the protections of providence, and in all the ble&s;&s;ings which re&s;ult from the work of redemption. This union is of the &s;ame na|ture with that which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between Chri&s;t and his Fa|ther. Accordingly he prays, in the 17th of John, that this union might commence, in time, between him and
<PB N="41" REF="017924_0040_0FA378C704838480">
tho&s;e whom his Father had given him from eternity. "Neither pray I for the&s;e alone, but for them al&s;o who &s;hall <HI>believe</HI> on me through their word; that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they may al&s;o <HI>be one in us.</HI>" This union makes the principal figure in the &s;acred writings, and is oftener al|luded to there than any other. It is on account of this union, that &s;aints or believers, in di&s;tinction from the world, are &s;aid to <HI>die</HI> with Chri&s;t, to be <HI>crucified</HI> with Chri&s;t; to be <HI>buried</HI> with Chri&s;t; to be <HI>quickened</HI> with Chri&s;t; to <HI>ri&s;e</HI> with Chri&s;t; to <HI>live</HI> with Chri&s;t; to be <HI>circumci&s;ed</HI> with Chri&s;t; to be <HI>bapti&s;ed</HI> with Chri&s;t; to be <HI>compleat</HI> in Chri&s;t; to <HI>be members of his body, of his fle&s;h, and of his bones.</HI> And it is on account of this union, that Chri&s;t and the church are &s;o often prefigured and repre|&s;ented by the various metaphors or Adam and Eve; of Adam and his po&s;terity; of the hu&s;band and wife; of Aaron and his robes; of the vine and its branches; of the head and its members; and of the corner &s;tone and &s;uper&s;tructure.</P>
<P>The&s;e unions, which we have now mentioned and de&s;cribed, are the only ones re&s;pecting Chri&s;t and men, that are to be found in the &s;acred oracles. And the&s;e are &s;o far from bearing the lea&s;t affinity to that union between Chri&s;t and <HI>all</HI> mankind, which Mr. Relly pleads for, that they are utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with it, and &s;ubver&s;ive of it. It the&s;e be true, that mu&s;t be fal&s;e. And if the&s;e be true, thereto one or other of them, mu&s;t every pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture, which &s;peaks of men's union to Chri&s;t, nece&s;&s;arily refer; and of cour&s;e, leave Mr. Relly's notion of union as de&s;titute of all &s;upport from divine revelation, as from rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="017924_0041_0FA378C7C51047A8">But it may be &s;till urged in &s;avour of the univer&s;al &s;alvation of mankind, that
<Q>Chri&s;t ta&s;ted death for eve|ry man, and made full atonement for the &s;ins of the whole world. And it is prepo&s;terous to imagine that any of tho&s;e who have been redeemed by the precious blood of the &s;on of God, &s;hould be finally lo&s;t.</Q>
I an&s;wer,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, this objection &s;uppo&s;es that God is obliged, <HI>in ju&s;tice,</HI> to &s;ave all mankind. Therefore,</P>
<P>Secondly, it &s;uppo&s;es that mankind &s;tand in no need of <HI>divine forgivene&s;s.</HI> For if the price of redemption which Chri&s;t hath paid, hath fully di&s;charged the debt which &s;inners owed to God, then they now owe him nothing, and if they owe him nothing, they have no|thing to be forgiven; and therefore can never with pro|priety u&s;e that petition in the Lord's prayer, "Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors." Wherefore.</P>
<P>Thirdly, there can be no grace di&s;played in the &s;alva|tion of &s;inners, by the go&s;pel. For it they all <HI>de&s;erve</HI> to be &s;aved, it is an act of <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> but not of <HI>grace,</HI> for God to &s;ave them. Though the apo&s;tle indeed tells be|lievers that they are "ju&s;tified <HI>freely by his grace,</HI> through the redemption that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t." But,</P>
<P>Fourthly, this objection is entirely founded in a mi&s;|apprehen&s;ion of the nature of Chri&s;t's atonement. It was not the intention of Chri&s;t, by his obedience and death, to make <HI>void</HI> the law, to alter the <HI>nature</HI> of &s;in, to <HI>move</HI> God <HI>in mercy,</HI> or <HI>oblige</HI> him, <HI>in ju&s;tice,</HI> to &s;ave &s;inners; for all this was impo&s;&s;ible. But his de&s;ign was, to <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h</HI> the law, to <HI>condemn</HI> &s;in in the fle&s;h, and main|tain the dignity of the divine character and government,
<PB N="43" REF="017924_0042_0FA378C8850FDE30">
and thereby open a door for the di&s;play of divine mer|cy and forgivene&s;s towards a peri&s;hing world. The death of Chri&s;t indeed hath removed all the ob&s;tacles, which before &s;tood in the way of the exerci&s;e of divine mercy; and that is all. God is no more obliged, <HI>in point of ju&s;tice,</HI> to &s;ave &s;inners, than if Chri&s;t had never died, and made atonement for &s;in. If God &s;aves any of the human race now, it is an act of <HI>mere grace,</HI> and not of <HI>ju&s;tice.</HI> Hence the <HI>extent</HI> of Chri&s;t's atonement does not in the lea&s;t determine, whether more or le&s;s, whether a part or the whole of mankind will finally be &s;aved. This can be determined only by the <HI>divine de|clarations,</HI> and <HI>gracious promi&s;es</HI> to Chri&s;t, which, as we have &s;hown, all concur to reprobate the notion of uni|ver&s;al &s;alvation.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid by &s;ome, that
<Q>God being from eternity perfectly and independently ble&s;&s;ed, could have no other motive in giving being to his creatures than <HI>their good,</HI> and of con&s;equence, he mu&s;t infallibly bring them all, &s;ooner or later, to a &s;tate of perfect happi|ne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>Though this objection is not void of plau&s;ibility, yet it &s;eems to carry &s;omething in it extremely ab&s;urd and di&s;honorable to the divine Maje&s;ty. For the Supreme Being to have him&s;elf entirely out of view in all his works, and to make every thing i. he univer&s;e &s;olely &s;ub&s;ervient to the good of the creature looks like &s;etting the creature above the infinitely great Jehovah! Be&s;ides, if the Deity aims &s;olely at the good of the creature, why &s;hould not the creature aim &s;olely at his own good, and make his own happine&s;s the &s;ole object of all his de&s;ires and pur&s;uits? And why &s;hould God blame
<PB N="44" REF="017924_0043_0FA378C9A1C6AAE0">
him, if in the pur&s;uit of this object, he ca&s;ts off fear, re&s;trains prayer, and loves and &s;erves the creature more than the Creator? Moreover, if the Divine Being aims &s;olely at the good of every individual per&s;on, why hath he not made every man perfectly happy&punc; through every &s;tage and period of his exi&s;tence? Why hath he made this world an Aceldema, a field of blood, and &s;cene of every evil, where men are born to trouble as the &s;parks fly upward? Why hath he not rather poured one continued, uninterrupted &s;tream of happine&s;s upon <HI>us,</HI> as he hath upon the angels above, who have never felt one <HI>&s;inful</HI> pa&s;&s;ion, nor one <HI>painful</HI> &s;en&s;ation &s;ince their exi&s;tence? Perhaps it will here be &s;aid, that though God aims &s;olely at the good of the intelligent creation <HI>in general,</HI> yet this does not nece&s;&s;arily imply that he mu&s;t <HI>con&s;tantly</HI> &s;eek and promote the good of <HI>eve|ry individual.</HI> We grant it, and abide the con&s;equence, which is this. If the good of the intelligent creation <HI>in general,</HI> may <HI>&s;ometimes,</HI> require God to give up the good of <HI>individuals,</HI> then it may, for aught we know, require him to give up the good of <HI>individuals forever.</HI> If the <HI>general good</HI> of mankind once required the <HI>tem|poral</HI> de&s;truction of Pharaoh and his ho&s;ts, who knows but <HI>the general good</HI> of the whole intelligent creation, may al&s;o require their <HI>eternal de&s;truction?</HI> Therefore allowing that God does, in this &s;en&s;e, aim &s;upremely and &s;olely at the <HI>general</HI> good of the intelli|gent creation, yet he may neverthele&s;s make myriads and myriads of <HI>individuals</HI> finally and eternally mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>There is, however, no rea&s;on to think that God had, from eternity, no other view in all his works of creation and providence, than the <HI>general</HI> good of the <HI>created</HI> &s;y|&s;tem. This &s;uppo&s;ition &s;eems to originate from a fal&s;e
<PB N="45" REF="017924_0044_0FA378CA06EEDF30">
conception of the <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>ble&s;&s;edne&s;s</HI> of the Divine Being. God is not an infinite <HI>Intelligence,</HI> who is per|fectly de&s;titute of all <HI>propen&s;ions.</HI> He is not, as the Epi|curians dream, an infinite <HI>Stoic,</HI> who is entirely unaffec|ted with, and indifferent to, all created and uncreated objects. But he is a Being of infinitely clear views, of infinitely wi&s;e de&s;igns, and of infinitely <HI>&s;trong propen&s;ities and affections.</HI> And the perfect, undi&s;turbed, eternal <HI>gra|tification</HI> of all the&s;e, is ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to his infinite, immutable ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. Though God was indeed per|fectly ble&s;&s;ed from eternity, independently of his crea|tures, yet not independently of his own views, purpo&s;es and affections. Could we only &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible, that God's purpo&s;es and de&s;igns &s;hould now be era&s;ed from his mind, or that he &s;hould now find him&s;elf unable to carry them into execution, this would prove an eternal diminution of the divine ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. But &s;ince known unto God are all his works from the beginning; &s;ince they have always &s;tood pre&s;ent to his view, as fully ac|compli&s;hed, they have been an eternal &s;ource of ineffable &s;atisfaction, &s;elf-complacency and delight. Now if God be capable of great and noble de&s;igns, if he be capable of great and noble exertions, and capable of taking a <HI>true, real, infinite plea&s;ure and delight</HI> in all his works, then it is ea&s;y to conceive that he might make his own <HI>plea&s;ure, his own ble&s;&s;edne&s;s</HI> or <HI>glory</HI> the grand and &s;upreme object in all his works of creation and providence, and have but an inferior and &s;ubordinate re&s;pect to the good of the creature. Accordingly the &s;cripture repre&s;ents this as his ultimate and &s;upreme end in the creation of the world. "The Lord hath made all things for him&s;elf; yea, even the wicked for the day of evil." Prov. 16.4. The apo&s;tle &s;ays, that "of him, and through him, and to him are all things." Rom. 11.36. And it is the
<PB N="46" REF="017924_0045_0FA378CAC583E168">
general voice of heaven, "Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honor, and power; for thou ha&s;t created all things, and for <HI>thy PLEASURE,</HI> they are and were created." Be&s;ides, the whole cour&s;e of providence from the beginning to this day, clearly de|mon&s;trates that God hath &s;ought his own glory &s;upreme|ly, and the good of the creature but &s;ubordinately in all his conduct. He expelled the rebel angels from heaven, de&s;troyed the old world, and burnt up Sodom and Go|morrah, not for <HI>their good,</HI> but for his <HI>own glory.</HI> And we know the perdition of Pharaoh and of Judas was not de&s;igned for <HI>their good,</HI> &s;ince Chri&s;t hath &s;aid of the one, that it had been good for him, if he had never been born, and God hath told us, he rai&s;ed up the other, that his name might be declared throughout all the earth Hence the &s;upreme and ultimate ends of the Deity in the creation of the world, afford no evidence in favour of the <HI>univer&s;al</HI> &s;alvation of the human race. It may be con&s;i&s;tent with God's original and eternal de&s;igns, for aught we know, to continue the mi&s;eries of the dam|ned to all eternity.</P>
<P>We often hear the infinite love and mercy of the De|ity pathetically urged as an irre&s;ragable argument again&s;t the eternity of future puni&s;hments. It is &s;aid,
<Q>this doctrine repre&s;ents the divine benevolence as far below the pity and compa&s;&s;ion that are found in the human heart. A parent's love cannot endure the thought that the dear offspring of his own bowels &s;hould be made fuel for quenchle&s;s flames. And the mo&s;t ma|levolent man on earth does not even <HI>wi&s;h</HI> that his wor&s;t enemy &s;hould lie down in eternal &s;orrow, and dwell with everla&s;ting burnings. Much le&s;s can the kind parent of the univer&s;e, who is good unto all,
<PB N="47" REF="017924_0046_0FA378CB85189C78">
and who&s;e tender mercies are over all his works, find it in his heart to doom any of the human race to the pains of hell <HI>forever.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This objection appears to be rather an addre&s;s to the &s;oft and tender pa&s;&s;ions of human nature, than an appeal to the cool and impartial dictates of right rea&s;on. The weaker pa&s;&s;ions of our animal nature, recoil in the view of tho&s;e acts of public ju&s;tice, which, our rea&s;on, our con&s;cience, and our <HI>real</HI> benevolence <HI>approve,</HI> and which the <HI>divine</HI> authority hath ab&s;olutely required. But who would hence conclude that <HI>our</HI> love and compa&s;&s;ion tran|&s;cend the tender mercies of the Deity? Did not Noah preach an hundred and twenty years to a &s;tupid and impenitent world? Did he not offer up &s;trong prayers and cries to the Father of Mercies; that he would gra|ciou&s;ly avert the dire de&s;truction which hung over their guilty heads? And did he not ri&s;e in fervor and impor|tunity, as the period of their day of grace and &s;pace of repentance drew nigh? How then mu&s;t he have felt when he &s;tood a &s;pectator of their final doom! Who can de&s;cribe or conceive the tender emotions of his heart, the painful conflicts and tumults of his brea&s;t, when the tremendous &s;cene opened to his view! When he beheld the rains falling, the fountains of the great deep break|ing up, and all nature in convul&s;ions; and heard the waves roaring, and a guilty world, day after day, cry|ing, and praying, and rending the heavens with their la&s;t, expiring groans! But &s;hall we imagine that God was equally <HI>&s;hocked</HI> on this &s;olemn occa&s;ion! No! He, (if we may be allowed the compari&s;on) &s;tood, like Bru|tus, with &s;tern ju&s;tice on his countenance, and beheld his beloved, but guilty offspring receive the due reward of their deeds.</P>

But who will hence conclude that the Father of Mercies had le&s;s love and compa&s;&s;ion towards the workman&s;hip of his own hands, than Abraham? Hence nothing but our danger can equal our delu&s;ion, if we imagine the Divine Being to be altogether &s;uch an one as our&s;elves, and judge of the divine clemency by our own.

<Q>I can ea&s;i|ly conceive that love &s;hould puni&s;h its beloved object for its good; but will it extend further? Will it pu|ni&s;h more than the benefit of the object puni&s;hed re|quires? Will it therefore puni&s;h forever?</Q>
No doubt it will, when the <HI>good of the object puni&s;hed is not the end</HI> propo&s;ed by the puni&s;hment. It is not always the in|tention of puni&s;hment to con&s;ult the <HI>good</HI> of the object puni&s;hed. This is never the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to <HI>capital</HI> puni&s;hments in this life. It is <HI>love</HI> to his country, or a tender regard to the <HI>public</HI> good, that induces the civil magi&s;trate to condemn the traitor or murderer to a pain|ful and ignominious death. It was love to God that fired the brea&s;t of Phineas, when he ru&s;hed into the camp of I&s;rael, and &s;lew Zimri and Kozbi. And then it was con&s;idered, approved and rewarded by the God of love. "And the Lord &s;pake unto Mo&s;es, &s;aying, Phineas the &s;on of Eleazer, the &s;on of Aaron the prie&s;t, hath turned my wrath away from the children of I&s;rael <HI>(while he was zealous for my &s;ake among them)</HI> that I con&s;umed not the children of I&s;rael in my jealou&s;y. Wherefore &s;ay, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. It is love to the objects injured, and not to the objects puni&s;hed, that dictates the nature, degree and duration of their puni&s;hment. Thus it is God's love to him&s;elf, to his &s;on, to his law, and to the general good of the
<PB N="50" REF="017924_0049_0FA378CE63FA24E0">
univer&s;e that induces him to puni&s;h the wicked after death. And as his infinite love to the&s;e objects will eternally remain, &s;o it will induce him to puni&s;h the wicked <HI>forever.</HI> His love will burn to the lowe&s;t hell. Hence we find the mo&s;t exemplary acts of divine ju&s;tice are repre&s;ented in &s;cripture as the expre&s;&s;ions of divine <HI>mercy.</HI> "O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is <HI>good</HI>; for his <HI>mercy</HI> endureth forever. To him that by wi&s;dom made the heavens; for his mercy endureth forever. To him that <HI>&s;mote in Egypt in their fir&s;t born</HI>; for his mercy endureth forever.

And <HI>Og</HI> king of Ba&s;han; <HI>for his mercy endureth forever.</HI>" Here the di&s;plays of divine ju&s;tice are con&s;idered as the di&s;plays of the &s;ame <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> which fir&s;t gave birth to the creation of the world But to whom is the di&s;play of this ju&s;tice, a <HI>mercy?</HI> To the wicked? Nay, but to the I&s;rael, to the church of God. Hence the degree and duration of the puni&s;hments of the wicked will always hold proportion to the degree and duration of the <HI>divine love</HI> to the righteous. According|ly God repre&s;ents his <HI>punitive ju&s;tice</HI> as the nece&s;&s;ary fruit and effect of his infinite goodne&s;s and mercy. When Mo&s;es reque&s;ted a &s;pecial manife&s;tation of his glory. He told him he would cau&s;e all his <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> to pa&s;s before him. And to do this, he proclaimed him&s;elf "the Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long &s;uffering, and abundant in goodne&s;s and truth&mdash;and that will by no means <HI>clear guilty.</HI>" Thus it appears that divine <HI>good|ne&s;s</HI> may, and infallibly will <HI>puni&s;h</HI> the wicked <HI>forever,</HI> if the <HI>good</HI> of the univer&s;e requires their <HI>eternal</HI> puni&s;hment.</P>

<P>It is further urged again&s;t the eternal puni&s;hments of the wicked, that

<P>This objection does, in a great mea&s;ure, if not en|tirely defeat it&s;elf. For it &s;uppo&s;es,</P>

And this probability is greatly corroborated by the many in&s;tances, which the &s;cripture gives us, of God's fulfilling his threatenings. He threatened to de&s;troy the old world, in the &s;pace of an hundred and twenty years. And accordingly at the time appointed he de&s;troyed them. He threatened to judge and de&s;troy the Egyptians, after a period of four hundred years.

He threatened de&s;truction to the Canaanites, and he de|&s;troyed them accordingly. He threatened a &s;eventy years captivity to his people I&s;rael, and he fulfilled his threatenings. He threatened the total exci&s;ion of the Jews, their city and temple, and they were cut off at the time predicted. He threatened the ruin of the &s;e|ven churches of A&s;ia; and his threatenings have long &s;ince been fulfilled. He threatened the utter extinction of Babylon and Ninevah, and his threatenings have had a mo&s;t exact and punctual accompli&s;hment.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Newton on the prophecies.</NOTE> The&s;e and many other in&s;tances which might be adduced,

afford a &s;trong probability and pre&s;umption that God will fulfil all his threatenings according to their <HI>real na|ture</HI> and <HI>import.</HI> Nor does the ca&s;e of Ninevah rightly under&s;tood &s;uppo&s;e the contrary. God's threatenings again&s;t Ninevah were evidently <HI>conditional,</HI> agreeably to that divine maxim in the 18th of Jeremiah. "At what in&s;tant I &s;hall &s;peak concerning a nation&mdash;If that nation, again&s;t whom I have pronounced <HI>turn</HI> from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them." And Jonah and the king of Ninevah evidently under|&s;tood the threatening with this <HI>implied</HI> condition; or why did Jonah preach, or the Ninevites fa&s;t? Be&s;ides,</P>
<P>Fifthly, this objection &s;uppo&s;es that it is as certain, <HI>as it can be,</HI> that God will puni&s;h the wicked <HI>eternally.</HI> No|thing can make this more certain than the <HI>divine threat|enings.</HI> If God's threatenings do not fix the certainty of future and eternal&punc; puni&s;hments beyond doubt, then if God really intends to puni&s;h the wicked to all eternity, he cannot make them certain of it in this life, for he can give them no higher evidence of it than his expre&s;s de|clarations and threatenings. So that if they will not be|lieve this evidence, neither would they be per&s;uaded, though one ro&s;e from the dead. Accordingly God a&s;|&s;ures us, that <HI>his threatenings</HI> are as much to be relied on as <HI>his promi&s;es,</HI> and that his <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>divinity</HI> are <HI>pledged</HI> in both. Thus his promi&s;es and threatenings are &s;et upon a level in the 18th of Jeremiah. "At what in&s;tant I &s;hall &s;peak concerning a nation, and concerning a king|dom, to pluck up and to pull down, and to de&s;troy it; if that nation, again&s;t whom I have pronounced turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them. And at what in&s;tant I &s;hall &s;peak con|cerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build
<PB N="55" REF="017924_0054_0FA378D18462B9F8">
and to plant it; if it do evil in my &s;ight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the <HI>good</HI> wherewith I &s;aid I would benefit it." Here God exhibits the &s;ame evidence of the truth and certainty of his threatenings as of his promi&s;es. And in other places he &s;ets them both on the &s;ame immutable footing. "If ye be willing and obedient, ye &s;hall eat the good of the land." Here is a promi&s;e. "But if ye refu&s;e and rebel, ye &s;hall be de|voured with the &s;word. Here is a threatening. And then both are confirmed, by the following emphatical a&s;&s;everation, "<HI>for the mouth of the LORD hath &s;poken it.</HI>" And this mode of a&s;&s;everation is often u&s;ed with re&s;pect to the divine threatenings as well as promi&s;es. The threatenings again&s;t Tyre run in this &s;olemn form: "Therefore, thus &s;aid the LORD GOD, Behold I am again&s;t thee, O Tyrus, and I will cau&s;e many na|tions to come up again&s;t thee, as the &s;ea cau&s;eth his waves to come up. And they &s;hall de&s;troy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her towers: I will al&s;o &s;crape her du&s;t from her, and make her like the top of a rock; it &s;hall be a place for the &s;preading of nets in the mid&s;t of the &s;ea: <HI>For I have &s;poken it &s;aith the Lord.</HI>" Ezek. 17. 3, 4, 5. This threatening proved true, and was fully accompli&s;hed many ages ago <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Newton on the prophecies.</NOTE> There is another threat|ening again&s;t God's own people of the &s;ame tenor. "Be|cau&s;e I have purged thee, and thou wa&s;t not purged, thou &s;halt not be purged from thy filthine&s;s any more, till I have cau&s;ed my fury to re&s;t upon thee. <HI>I the Lord have &s;poken it; it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, and I will do it.</HI>" Ezek. 14.13, 14. Thus it appears that God's <HI>threatenings</HI> have the &s;ame ground of certainty as his <HI>promi&s;es.</HI> They are both founded on the infallible veracity, and ab&s;olute immutability of Him <HI>who cannot lie.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="017924_0055_0FA378D24581CA40">Another objection is this.
<Q>If &s;in and mi&s;ery be not totally aboli&s;hed, and all mankind finally &s;aved, then Satan will triumph, and Chri&s;t will fail of accompli&s;h|ing one of his principal ends in the work of redemp|tion, which is to brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head, and de&s;troy the works of the devil.</Q></P>
<P>To this it may be replied, in the fir&s;t place, that <HI>merely the aboli&s;hing of &s;in and mi&s;ery</HI> will not de&s;troy the works of the devil, and brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head. For &s;uppo&s;ing in any period of eternity, &s;in and mi&s;ery &s;hould be per|fectly aboli&s;hed, Satan would &s;till have cau&s;e to triumph, that he had brought an indelible &s;tain upon the divine character, and done an irreparable injury to his creatures, and &s;o far fru&s;trated the kind and benevolent purpo&s;es of the Deity in the work of creation. Unle&s;s,</P>
<P>Secondly, all the &s;in and mi&s;ery which he had proved the means of introducing into God's world, are <HI>turned again&s;t him,</HI> and made in&s;trumental of bringing <HI>more glory</HI> to God, and <HI>more happine&s;s</HI> to the univer&s;e than if they had never exi&s;ted. When this is done, Satan is effectu|ally conquered, his <HI>head</HI> is brui&s;ed, and his works de|&s;troyed. But,</P>
<P>Thirdly, if the &s;in and mi&s;ery of ages, can be made the means of bringing <HI>more glory to God,</HI> and <HI>more happi|ne&s;s</HI> to the univer&s;e, than if they had never exi&s;ted; then the &s;in and mi&s;ery of the damned through eternity, may prove the means of promoting the &s;ame ends for|ever. Therefore, in order effectually to de&s;troy the works of the devil; and brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head it may be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that Satan and multitudes of his followers &s;hould be eternally mi&s;erable. Accordingly the &s;cripture repre&s;ents Chri&s;t as triumphing over Satan,
<PB N="57" REF="017924_0056_0FA378D365FDC4E0">
by turning all his &s;chemes and works again&s;t him, and finally ca&s;ting him and his adherents into the bottom|le&s;s pit, under the wrath of God, and the everla&s;ting contempt of the heavenly world. And thus Chri&s;t is exalted, and his enemies are made his foot&s;tool.</P>
<P>Having &s;hown that there will be a general judgment &mdash;that there is an e&s;&s;ential di&s;tinction between the righ|teous and the wicked&mdash;that agreeably to this di&s;tinction, they will be &s;eperated at the la&s;t day, and rewarded and pu|ni&s;hed according to their works&mdash;that their re&s;pective re|wards and puni&s;hments will endure <HI>forever</HI>&mdash;and that there be no <HI>&s;olid</HI> objections again&s;t the&s;e &s;olemn and intere&s;ting truths; it only remains to conclude this di&s;cour&s;e with &s;uch reflections as are naturally &s;ugge&s;ted by the &s;ubject.</P>

Various &s;chemes have been pur&s;ued to e&s;tabli&s;h the notion of the final re&s;toration and happine&s;s of all lap&s;ed beings.

&s;alvation, e&s;pecially as maintained by Mr. Relly and his followers, is fundamentally wrong and ab&s;olutely fatal. Their doctrine teaches, that holine&s;s and piety are empty names; that faith, love, repentance, humility and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, are no other than hypocri&s;y, pride and idolatry; that it is impo&s;&s;ible for a man to prevent his &s;alvation by the mo&s;t irreligious, abandoned, profligate life; that there is no e&s;&s;ential difference between the righteous and the wicked; that they &s;hall not be &s;eperated at the la&s;t day, but Cain, Pharaoh, Haman, Herod, Judas, Pilate, and all the re&s;t of the impenitent world, &s;hall &s;it down with Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob in the kingdom of glory, and no human &s;oul be finally &s;hut out. Such a doctrine as this is replete with infinite mi&s;chief. It &s;trikes at the root of all experimental religion. It confounds all no|tions of virtue and vice. It de&s;troys all di&s;tinction of characters. It &s;aps the foundation of morality. It takes off every re&s;traint from vice. It opens the &s;tood gates of iniquity. It renders even God, and Chri&s;t, and the prophets and the apo&s;tles, the mini&s;ters of &s;in. It &s;peaks peace to the wicked, to whom, faith God, there is no peace. It has indeed every &s;ignature of a damnable doctrine. There are many errors, no doubt, in regard to the modes and forms, and &s;ome of the doctrines of re|ligion, which, though they cannot abide the clear light of the la&s;t great day, will not exclude men from the &s;a|vour of God, or the kingdom of heaven. But this is a <HI>practical</HI> error of the fir&s;t magnitude, which will even|tually prove fatal in the day of deci&s;ion. Our Lord hath &s;o clearly de&s;cribed the proce&s;s of the final judgment, that we may as certainly know <HI>now,</HI> that all unrege|nerate, unholy, impenitent, unclean, impure per&s;ons &s;hall then be condemned, as if we now &s;tood before that awful tribunal, and heard the la&s;t deci&s;ive &s;entence de|nounced

again&s;t them, Depart, ye cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting are, prepared for the devil and his angels.</P>
<P>Some &s;eem reluctant to pronounce ab&s;olutely upon the fatal tendency of this doctrine, and chu&s;e only to &s;ay, if it be <HI>true,</HI> we are as &s;afe as tho&s;e who embrace it. But we ought nather to &s;ay, if there be no future judgment then we are all &s;afe, but not otherwi&s;e. Admit a future judgment, and there remains no room for doubt, whether God will make at difference between him that &s;erveth him, and him that &s;erveth him not; between him that &s;weareth, and him that feareth an oath. In|deed the &s;uppo&s;ition that no di&s;tinction will be made be|tween the righteous and the wicked at the la&s;t day, wholly &s;uper&s;edes the nece&s;&s;ity and even propriety of a general judgment, Why &s;hould God appoint a day, in which, to judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s, if no per|&s;ons were to be judged, no characters to be examined, and no di&s;plays of retributive ju&s;tice to be made! "Be not deceived, God is not mocked; for what a man &s;oweth, that &s;hall he al&s;o reap. For he that &s;oweth to the fle&s;h, &s;hall of the fle&s;h reap corruption: But he that &s;oweth to the &s;pirit, &s;hall of the &s;pirit reap life ever|la&s;ting."</P>
<P>Did the human heart naturally prefer light to dark|ne&s;s, and truth to error, it would be &s;ufficient to di&s;co|ver the truth and expo&s;e the error and leave every per|&s;on to follow the cool dictates of his own under&s;tanding. But &s;ince the ca&s;e is quite the rever&s;e, it becomes proper to addre&s;s the hearts and con&s;ciences, the hopes and fears of men, and give divine truths all the advantages which they nece&s;&s;arily derive from the motives of eter|nity. Hence the apo&s;tles addre&s;&s;ed mankind on the
<PB N="63" REF="017924_0062_0FA378D785FF6A68">
weighty concerns of the &s;oul, with great &s;olemnity, tenderne&s;s and pathos. "Knowing therefore the <HI>terror</HI> of the Lord, we per&s;uade men." "Now then we are amba&s;&s;adors for Chri&s;t, as though God did be&s;eech you by us; we pray you in Chri&s;t's &s;tead, be ye reconciled to God." Supported and directed by &s;uch examples as the&s;e, there needs no apology for addre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e who are particularly concerned in this &s;erious &s;ubject, and warning them again&s;t the fatal dangers to which they are ominently expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>There are many, at this day, who are labouring to rea&s;on them&s;elves out of the belief of all truth both hu|man and divine; and boa&s;t of arriving to a certainty that all things are uncertain. But it may be que&s;tioned whether the human mind, which is formed to &s;ee and feel the force of truth, will permit any man to approach nearer to perfect <HI>&s;ceptici&s;m,</HI> than perfect knowledge. By an habit of re&s;i&s;ting truth, however, &s;ome may have un&s;ettled their minds re&s;pecting divine things, at lea&s;t; and become expo&s;ed to embrace <HI>error,</HI> if any thing, in|&s;tead of truth in matters of religion. And for this rea&s;on, they are very liable to fall in with the delu&s;ive &s;cheme of univer&s;al &s;alvation, which hath a tendency to diffu&s;e &s;ome glimmering rays of light in their dark and de&s;pair|ing minds. But let &s;uch be entreated to awake from their reveries, and attend to the great realities with which they are &s;urrounded and connected. Eternal rewards and puni&s;hments are &s;ub&s;tantial realities, whe|ther they believe them to be &s;o or not. By &s;hutting their eyes again&s;t them, their danger is not in the lea&s;t dimini&s;hed, but greatly enhanced. The period is ha&s;tening when they mu&s;t be thoroughly awakened from their delu&s;ive dreams. The &s;olemn &s;cenes of the la&s;t day will draw the curtain
<PB N="64" REF="017924_0063_0FA378D845DEC6F0">
a&s;ide, and open upon their a&s;toni&s;hed minds the great realities which we have de&s;cribed. And the&s;e objects, which, at a di&s;tance, made Felix and Bel&s;hazzar tremble, will equally &s;hock their guilty &s;ouls, whenever their pre&s;ence can no longer be re&s;i&s;ted. A realizing &s;en&s;e of guilt, and folly, and the divine wrath will make any human heart &s;toop, and fill it with unutterable angui&s;h, horror and de&s;pair. O! that they would therefore turn from &s;uch gloomy pro&s;pects, and attend to tho&s;e lumi|nous truths, which will pour a flood of light into their ravi&s;hed minds, and give them that joy which is un|&s;peakable and full of glory.</P>
<P>There is a larger number than the&s;e, perhaps, who are making &s;wift and bold advances in the cau&s;e of in|fidelity, and leave no methods unemployed to di&s;credit divine revelation, and &s;ubvert the foundations of chri&s;|tianity. They need not tell the world their motives. Were they not convinced that the bible contains the doctrine of eternal puni&s;hments, they would not wrack their inventions to find arguments to per&s;uade them|&s;elves and others that the &s;criptures are a cunningly devi&s;ed fable. Let this doctrine be era&s;ed from the bi|ble, and every dei&s;t would become its votary, and ex|change his Bolingbroke, Voltaire or Che&s;terfield for that &s;acred volumn. It is this doctrine alone that com|pels them to renounce a book, which bears &s;o many &s;ig|natures of divinity, and which they are compelled to acknowledge contains the mo&s;t excellent in&s;tructions, in&s;titutions and commands. But &s;o <HI>weak is their infide|lity,</HI> we pre&s;ume they would rejoice to find the bible on their &s;ide, to confirm their wavering hopes and fee|ble pro&s;pects of future happine&s;s. And this is what the &s;cheme of univer&s;al &s;alvation propo&s;es. It flatters them
<PB N="65" REF="017924_0064_0FA378DC0709D970">
the bible is their friend, and announces eternal felicity to them and to all mankind. Accordingly numbers of a dei&s;tical turn have become converts to this agreeable doctrine, and many others are eminently expo&s;ed to fall into the fatal &s;nare. But this is flying from the iron weapon and ru&s;hing on the bow of &s;teel. For if any di&s;card the bible becau&s;e they imagine it does contain the doctrine of eternal puni&s;hments, or embrace it be|cau&s;e they think it does not, they will infallibly meet with di&s;appointment and ruin in the end. There is one way and but one, in which, they may e&s;cape the wrath which is to come, and that is, by repentance towards God, and faith in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. This is the only foundation of hope, that God hath provided and revealed; nor can any other foundation be laid, which will not give way, when the winds blow, and the &s;torms of divine wrath beat upon the guilty &s;oul.</P>
<P>The &s;ons of plea&s;ure, who indulge to every &s;inful gra|tification, find it exceedingly difficult, in their &s;erious intervals, to &s;tifle their natural apprehen&s;ions of guilt and puni&s;hment, and therefore readily catch hold of any thing which promi&s;es them impunity in the paths of vice. The doctrine of &s;alvation for <HI>all</HI> men, without exception, or di&s;tinction of characters, perfectly gratifies their hearts and coincides with their reigning views and pur&s;uits. Accordingly, when this is propo&s;ed to their belief, they will, if po&s;&s;ible, yield their a&s;&s;ent, and &s;hake off tho&s;e painful fears of the wrath to come, through which, they have all their life time been &s;ubject to bon|dage. But let them beware of this &s;lender &s;helter. It will infallibly deceive and di&s;appoint them. The agree|ablene&s;s of the doctrine is a &s;trong indication of its re|pugnancy to the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, which was never re|li&s;hed
<PB N="66" REF="017924_0065_0FA378DCC56D34B8">
by per&s;ons of an immoral, profligate character. When John preached Herod was offended. When Chri&s;t preached the whole congregation was filled with wrath. And when Paul preached upon <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s, temperance,</HI> and <HI>judgment to come,</HI> the loo&s;e and abandoned Felix trembled. And it is the genuine tendency of the doctrines of the go&s;pel to convince profligate &s;inners that they are in the gaul of bitterne&s;s and bonds of ini|quity. They may therefore be a&s;&s;ured that the &s;oothing doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation is diametrically oppo&s;ite to the truth as it is in Je&s;us. Let them not then li&s;ten to the plea&s;ing delu&s;ion, and ble&s;s them&s;elves, &s;aying, we &s;hall have peace, though we walk in the imagination of our hearts, to add drunkenne&s;s to thir&s;t. For the Lord will not &s;pare them, but his anger, and his jealou|&s;y &s;hall &s;moak again&s;t them, and all the cur&s;es that are written in the book of God &s;hall lie upon them forever. "Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart chear thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the &s;ight of thine eyes: <HI>But know thou, that for all the&s;e things God will bring thee into judgment." "Be not deceived:</HI> Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abu|&s;ers of them&s;elves with mankind, nor thieves, nor cove|tous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners &s;hall inherit the kingdom of God."</P>

Are you <HI>cer|tain,</HI> that men cannot be under &s;trong delu&s;ions, to be|lieve a lie, that they may be damned? Are you <HI>certain</HI> that you can appear before the judgment &s;eat of Chri&s;t with &s;afety? Are you <HI>certain</HI> that there is no meaning in this &s;aying of our compa&s;&s;ionate Redeemer, "What is a man profited, if he &s;hould gain the whole world, and lo&s;e his own &s;oul? or what &s;hall a man give in exchange for his &s;oul?" In a word, are you <HI>certain,</HI> it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, that your precious and immortal &s;ouls &s;hould be lo&s;t forever? If not, what an amazing ri&s;k do you run, to &s;u&s;pend all your eternal intere&s;ts upon a &s;ingle point of <HI>mere &s;peculation,</HI> which &s;tands condemned by the concurrent voice of rea&s;on, of con&s;cience, of &s;cripture, and of the chri&s;tian world! But (to u&s;e nearly the words of an eminently great and pious divine) if you are de|termined to enquire no farther into the matter now, give me leave, at lea&s;t, from a &s;incere concern, that you may not heap upon your heads more aggravated ruin, to in|treat you, that you would be cautious how you expo&s;e your&s;elves to yet greater danger, by what you mu&s;t your&s;elves own to be unnece&s;&s;ary, I mean, <HI>Attempts to pervert others from believing the truths of the go&s;pel</HI> Leave them, for God's &s;ake, and for your own, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e plea&s;ures, and tho&s;e hopes, which nothing but the truth as it is in Je&s;us can give them; and act not as if you were &s;olicitous to add to the guilt of an infidel the tenfold damnation, which they who have been the per|verters and de&s;troyers of the &s;ouls of others, mu&s;t expect to meet, if tho&s;e divine threatenings which they have &s;o adventrou&s;ly oppo&s;ed &s;hould prove, as they certainly will, the mo&s;t &s;erious, and to them the mo&s;t dreadful, truths. If I cannot prevail here, but the <HI>pride of di&s;|playing
<PB N="68" REF="017924_0067_0FA378DE44406CB8">
a &s;uperiority of under&s;tanding</HI> &s;hould bear on &s;uch readers, even in oppo&s;ition to their own favorite maxims of the <HI>innocence of error,</HI> and the <HI>equality of all religious con|&s;i&s;tent with &s;ocial virtue,</HI> to do their utmo&s;t to trample down the truths of the go&s;pel with contempt; I would however di&s;mi&s;s them with one propo&s;al, which I think the importance of the affair may fully ju&s;tify. If you have done with your examination into the promi&s;es and threatenings of the go&s;pel, and each of you determine to live and conduct him&s;elf as if they were a&s;&s;uredly fal&s;e, &s;it down then, and <HI>make a memorandum of that de|termination.</HI>
<Q>On &s;uch a day of &s;uch a year, I delibe|rately re&s;olved, that I would live and die rejecting all <HI>experimental</HI> religion. This day I determined, not only to renounce all <HI>vital piety,</HI> but al&s;o to make it a &s;erious part of the bu&s;ine&s;s of my life, to de&s;troy, as far as I po&s;&s;ibly can, all regard to it in the minds of others; in calm, &s;teady defiance of that day, when the followers of Chri&s;t &s;ay, he &s;hall appear in &s;o much maje&s;ty and terror to execute the vengeance threatened to his ene|mies.</Q>
Dare you write this, and &s;ign it? I firmly be|lieve that many a man, who would be thought an <HI>Uni|ver&s;ali&s;t,</HI> and endeavours to increa&s;e the number, would not do it. And if you in particular dare not do it, whence does that &s;mall remainder of caution ari&s;e? The cau&s;e is plain. There is in your con&s;cience &s;ome &s;ecret apprehen&s;ion, that the&s;e oppo&s;ed, the&s;e rejected, the&s;e de|rided truths of the go&s;pel may, after all <HI>prove true.</HI> And if there be &s;uch an apprehen&s;ion, then let con&s;cience do its office, and convince you of the impious madne&s;s of acting as if they were <HI>mo&s;t certainly and demon&s;trably fal&s;e.</HI> Let it tell you at large, how po&s;&s;ible it is that <HI>haply you may be found fighting again&s;t God</HI>: That, bold as you are in de&s;ying the terrors of the Lord, you may po&s;&s;ibly fall

<P>If any thing farther needs to be added, it is by way of direction, how to &s;hun the baneful influence of the&s;e dangerous opinions, which it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ome, at this day, to propagate with great apparent zeal.</P>
<P>And here the fir&s;t thing that occurs is, to &s;earch the &s;criptures, which are the infallible &s;tandard of truth and error. We &s;hould carry every doctrine, which offers it|&s;elf to our belief, "to the law and to the te&s;timony," and abide that divine deci&s;ion. The rule is perfect. The only danger lies in the mi&s;application, which in|deed is too often the ca&s;e. No corrupt principle of a religious nature, hath ever failed to pre&s;s the bible into its &s;ervice, and claim the &s;anction of divine authority. But though &s;ome disjointed &s;entences in the word of God, may &s;eem to countenance the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and li|centious opinions, and their votaries may fly to this di|vine &s;anctuary for protection; yet the &s;acred oracles taken in their general connection, fully reprobate every fal&s;e &s;cheme of religion that ever has been, or ever can be devi&s;ed. They draw &s;uch a character of the Supreme Being, of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, of the Divine Spirit, of the human heart, and of the genuine nature and effects of pure and undefiled religion, that the <HI>doctrines according to godline&s;s,</HI> may be clearly di&s;tingui&s;hed from all their counterfeits. The &s;criptures in general have a plain, determinate,
<PB N="70" REF="017924_0069_0FA378E146F53830">
con&s;i&s;tent meaning, which may be clearly under&s;tood. Therefore no two oppo&s;ite doctrines of religion can both be agreeable to the word of God; but one or the other mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;tand condemned by it. Hence, for in&s;tance, if the doctrine of eternal puni&s;hments be really <HI>agreeable</HI> to the bible, as we have endeavoured to &s;how, then the doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation is entirely <HI>con|trary</HI> to it, and not one text that can be found, does, in its true &s;en&s;e, give the lea&s;t degree of evidence in its fa|vour. This being the ca&s;e, there is all encouragement to &s;earch the &s;criptures, to &s;ee which of the&s;e two dia|metrically oppo&s;ite doctrines is true. It would be &s;trange indeed if this could not be determined by every <HI>hone&s;t</HI> enquirer. If any are in doubt therefore, we would in|treat them to take heed to this &s;ure word of prophecy, which is able to make them wi&s;e unto &s;alvation.</P>
<P>In the next place, there is caution to be u&s;ed again&s;t the &s;eduction of tho&s;e who propagate corrupt and dan|gerous &s;entiments. Be not deceived by their preten&s;ions to &s;uperior penetration and knowledge. Men of the &s;tronge&s;t minds and mo&s;t exten&s;ive literature have often committed the gro&s;&s;e&s;t blunders in their religious &s;pecu|lations, and then employed all their learning and abilities to maintain and propagate them. Some of the enemies of divine revelation, and of the peculiar doctrines of the go&s;pel, have di&s;played &s;hining talents and a profu&s;ion of learning, in pleading the cau&s;e of error, and attempting to &s;hake the pillars of our holy religion. And many of their admirers appear to have been dazzled and allured into their &s;nares by an implicit faith in their great abili|ties. But this betrays weakne&s;s. Great men are not always wi&s;e: They are liable to err; and therefore we
<PB N="71" REF="017924_0070_0FA378E205B2BD80">
&s;hould examine their opinions as well as tho&s;e of other men, and admit them only upon the foot of real evidence.</P>
<P>Nor are we to be bia&s;&s;ed in favour of men's licentious principles, on account of their amiable moral characters. It is a ju&s;t ob&s;ervation of Dr. Brown, that men of &s;trict morality have often di&s;&s;eminated the mo&s;t licentious and pernicious doctrines. It is well known, that Epicurus, the father of doctrinal licentiou&s;ne&s;s, never lived up to his prin|ciples, but maintained a regular and exemplary life. Spino&s;a, the father of &s;peculative <HI>Athei&s;m,</HI> was a man of &s;obriety and apparent devotion. Lord Herbert, who was, if not the father, yet the principal advocate for <HI>Dei&s;m</HI> in the la&s;t century, appears to have had a &s;erious mind, and a con&s;cientious regard to duty. And we Know that &s;ome of the advocates for univer&s;al &s;alvation, are men of ami|able natural di&s;po&s;itions and fair moral characters. But ought we hence to entertain a more favourable regard for athei&s;m, dei&s;m, or any other licentious doctrines. By no means. Tho&s;e principles are &s;till to be &s;huned at the peril of our &s;ouls.</P>
<P>Nor again, are we to believe the propagators of error, though they throw out the mo&s;t pompous and &s;olemn a&s;&s;everations of their &s;incerity, impartiality and uncom|mon intercour&s;e with the Deity, and concern for his glo|ry. Tho' we &s;cruple not their &s;incerity, yet we &s;cruple the propriety of throwing out the profe&s;&s;ion of it, which can have no tendency to enlighten, but only pre|judice the minds of the credulous. This, which we ven|ture to call an artifice, is often employed by the advo|cates for univer&s;al &s;alvation. Mr. White, in his treati&s;e
<PB N="72" REF="017924_0071_0FA378E2C5F4A880">
on the univer&s;al re&s;toration of all &s;inful creatures to the divine favour, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 6.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> makes the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;everations of his &s;incerity and &s;acred regard for the divine glory. His expre&s;&s;ions are the&s;e,
<Q>And here I do in the fear of God mo&s;t humbly pro&s;trate my&s;elf before his divine Maje&s;ty, and in the deepe&s;t &s;en&s;e of my own darkne&s;s and di&s;|tance from him, do with all my might beg of that in|finite goodne&s;s I am endeavouring to repre&s;ent to others, that if &s;omething like this platform and pro&s;|pect of things, be not agreeable to that revealed and natural light he hath given to us, that my under&s;tand|ing may be interrupted and my de&s;ign fall, and that the Lord would pardon my attempt: and I know he will do &s;o, for he hath given me to have no fur|ther concern for this matter, than as I apprehend it to be a mo&s;t glorious truth, witne&s;&s;ed to both by the &s;criptures of truth and by the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential principles of our own rea&s;on, and which will be found at the la&s;t opening of the everla&s;ting go&s;pel, to recover in that opening a degenerate world.</Q>
Mr. Relly holds out the &s;ame lure to his readers, to place an implicit faith in the rectitude of his views, and the divinity of his doc|trines. In a preface to one volume of his writings, he a&s;&s;ures his readers that his di&s;cour&s;es were delivered ex|tempore, without any previous &s;tudy or forethought, and flowed from his lips as they were dictated by the divine &s;pirit. For &s;ays he, I followed that divine direction given to the apo&s;tles, "Take no thought beforehand what ye &s;hall &s;peak, neither do ye premeditate: for it is not ye that &s;peak, but the Holy Gho&s;t." How pre|&s;umptous is it for any man, at this day, to pretend to imitate the apo&s;tles in this re&s;pect! and e&s;pecially for

<P>Error often employs &s;uch <HI>artifices</HI> as truth neither needs nor approves. They &s;ometimes, however, prove &s;ucce&s;sful, and deceive the inattentive and unguarded. Tho&s;e who u&s;e them therefore are dangerous per&s;ons, and their corrupting influence is &s;tudiou&s;ly to be avoided. Their doctrines are fatal if imbibed; and even when they are not fully adopted, they tend to harden the heart, and &s;tupify the con&s;cience. The bare thought that &s;ome maintain that all will be &s;aved, begets a &s;ecret hope that po&s;&s;ibly it may be true, and that there is not &s;o much danger in <HI>impenitence</HI> and <HI>unbelief</HI> as many have long im|agined, and pretended. Therefore to hear the <HI>univer&s;ali&s;ts</HI> preach, or read their writings, merely to know what they can &s;ay in defence of their errors, is like Eve's li&s;tening to the rea&s;oning of the &s;erpent, and may, in the event, prove equally fatal. Accordingly the &s;cripture character|i&s;es fal&s;e teachers, and warns you to avoid them. The apo&s;tle Paul, who was troubled with the perverters of the go&s;pel, treats them with great plainne&s;s and &s;everity. "But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other go&s;pel unto you, than that which we have preach|ed unto you, let him be accur&s;ed. As we &s;aid before, &s;o &s;ay I now again, if any man preach any other go&s;pel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accur&s;|ed." The apo&s;tle John directs man to have no intimate connection with fal&s;e teachers. "If any come unto you, and bring not this doctrine, that is the doctrine of Chri&s;t mentioned in the preceeding ver&s;e, receive him not into your hou&s;e, neither bid him God &s;peed. For he that biddeth him God &s;peed, is partaker of his evil deeds."

And Solomon gives a &s;imilar caution and direction. "Cea&s;e, my &s;on, to hear the in&s;truction that <HI>cau&s;eth to err.</HI>" Thus you have not only the voice of rea&s;on, but the voice of God to warn you to &s;hun the pre&s;ence and influence of tho&s;e that lie wait to deceive.</P>
<P>The la&s;t direction is, to repent and believe the go&s;pel. This will place you beyond the reach of all fatal errors. When your hearts are e&s;tabli&s;hed with grace, you will no longer be liable to be carried about with diver&s;e and &s;trange doctrines. When you yield cordial obedience to the divine will, there is a promi&s;e that you &s;hall know of doctrines whether they be of God. When you em|brace the go&s;pel from the <HI>heart,</HI> it will be out of the pow|er of Satan or any of his in&s;truments to deceive you. When you &s;incerely love God, all things &s;hall work to|gether for your good, and prepare you more and more for the great, and glorious, and &s;olemn &s;cenes, which death, judgment and eternity will &s;oon open to your view. But &s;o long as you remain in a &s;tate of impeni|tence and unbelief, you are in imminent danger of making &s;hip wreck not only of your faith, but of your pre|cious and immortal &s;ouls. Though you &s;hould e&s;cape every fatal error, and in &s;peculation, clearly under&s;tand every doctrine of the go&s;pel, yet if you hold even <HI>the truth</HI> in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, you will certainly peri&s;h. An ortho|dox creed and a fair <HI>external</HI> appearance are of no avail, in point of divine acceptance, without a broken and con|trite heart, and an <HI>unfeigned love</HI> of the truth. For <HI>with the heart</HI> man believeth unto righteou&s;ne&s;s: And <HI>without holine&s;s</HI> no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord. Therefore let the wicked for&s;ake his way, and the <HI>unrighteous</HI> man <HI>his thoughts</HI>: And let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy on him; and to our God for he will abun|dantly

pardon. Nor is there the lea&s;t excu&s;e for a mo|ment's delay. Behold, now is the accepted time; be|hold, now is the day of &s;alvation. Life and death are now &s;et before you. This is the only day of grace and &s;pace of repentance you will ever enjoy. You are now placed between two va&s;t eternities of happine&s;s and woe. You are therefore of all the creatures of God, in the mo&s;t critical, &s;erious and &s;olemn &s;ituation. Your life, or your death, your happine&s;s, or your mi&s;ery for a boundle&s;s eternity, is &s;u&s;pended on the &s;lender thread of life. And death is advancing with rapid &s;peed to &s;eal up your ac|count for the judgment of the great day; when in the view of the a&s;&s;embled univer&s;e, you mu&s;t hear your doom, and either ri&s;e with the righteous to man&s;ions of eternal bli&s;s, or &s;ink with the wicked down to regions of eternal darkne&s;s, horror and de&s;pair! Be intreated then, O &s;inner, to agree with thine adver&s;ary quickly, while thou art in the way with him, lea&s;t he deliver thee to the Judge, and the Judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be ca&s;t into pri&s;on. Verily thou &s;halt by no means come out thence, till thou ha&s;t paid the uttermo&s;t farthing.!!</P>
