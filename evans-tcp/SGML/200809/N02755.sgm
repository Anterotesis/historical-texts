<P>KING <HI>David,</HI> having appointed <HI>Solomon</HI> his Son to &s;ucceed him in the Throne of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> expre&s;s'd his Concern that he might be a wi&s;e and ju&s;t Ruler, by praying for him, as in the fir&s;t Ver&s;e of this P&s;alm, <HI>Give the King thy Judgments, O God, and thy Righteou&s;ne&s;s unto the King's Son.</HI> The <HI>King's Son</HI> is &s;tyl'd the <HI>King,</HI> becau&s;e he was anointed, and did &s;it on the Throne of the Kingdom, his aged Father yet living. This Prayer of <HI>David</HI> for his Succe&s;&s;or was acceptable to God, who immediately gave him a&s;&s;urance that it &s;hould
<PB N="6" REF="003282_0004_0FF03DAA4BBBAD68">be granted, by enabling him to fore&s;ee and foretel the Glories of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Reign; tho' it mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd and acknowledg'd, that the Prophecy thereof recorded, does ulti|mately refer to the Kingdom of a <HI>greater than Solomon,</HI> the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> of whom <HI>Solomon</HI> in all his Glory was an illu&s;trious Type.</P>
<P>In this remarkable Prediction (which am|ply and elegantly de&s;cribes a happy Govern|ment, &s;uch as we are this Day rejoycing in) we may take Notice,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Of the Equity of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Govern|ment: <HI>He &s;hall judge thy People with Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and thy Poor with Judgment.</HI> This his good Father pray'd that he might do, and this the <HI>Spirit of Prophecy.</HI> &s;aid that he would do; and that he accordingly did &s;o, appears from the &s;acred Hi&s;tory of his Reign. He &s;oon gave proof of the Wi&s;dom of God that was in him to do Judgment. The Queen of <HI>Sheba</HI> di&s;cern'd and pronounc'd, that it was <HI>becau&s;e the Lord loved I&s;rael, that he made him King, to do Judgment and Ju&s;tice.</HI> The Throne is e&s;tabli&s;hed by Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the King adorned therewith. Job 29.14. <HI>I put on Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and it clothed me: my Judgment was as a Robe and a Diadem.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Peaceablene&s;s of his Government; <HI>The Mountains &s;hall bring peace to the People,
<PB N="7" REF="003282_0005_0FF03DAC99B97AD0">and the little Hills by Righteou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;In his days &s;hall be abundance of peace.</HI> It is &s;aid, that the Mountains and Hills &s;hall bring Peace, either only becau&s;e <HI>Judea</HI> was a moun|tainous and hilly Country; or becau&s;e Peace &s;hould &s;o abound, as that even tho&s;e places &s;hould be &s;afe and quiet, where wild Bea&s;ts and Robbers were wont to lurk, that they might do Mi&s;chief. Happy is the Govern|ment, under which Men lead a quiet and peaceable Life.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Mercifulne&s;s of his Government towards the poor and oppre&s;&s;ed, and the &s;everity of it toward the in&s;olent Oppre&s;&s;ors. <HI>He &s;hall judge the poor of the People, he &s;hall &s;ave the Children of the needy, and &s;hall break in pieces the Oppre&s;&s;or.&mdash;He &s;hall deliver the needy when he crieth: the poor al&s;o, and him that hath no helper&mdash;he &s;hall redeem their Soul from deceit and violence: and precious &s;hall their Blood be in his &s;ight.</HI>&mdash;Whereas many Princes did not value the Lives of their poor Subjects, he would make a precious Account of the Blood of the meane&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;pi&s;ed among his People, and defend them again&s;t tho&s;e who thir&s;ted for it, or re|venge it on any that &s;hould &s;hed it. As good Magi&s;trates are Fathers to their Country in general, &s;o particularly to the poor, that are mo&s;t helple&s;s and expo&s;ed.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="8" REF="003282_0006_0FF03DAEE1FE3988">
4. The Piety of his Government: that Religion &s;hould flouri&s;h under it: <HI>They &s;hall fear thee</HI> (i. e. God) <HI>as long as the Sun and Moon endure, throughout all Generations.</HI> The building of the Temple, and e&s;tabli&s;hing God's Wor&s;hip therein, did promote Religion in <HI>Solomon's</HI> time, which was continued, tho' not without Interruption, in the time of his Succe&s;&s;ors, the Kings of <HI>Judah,</HI> and af|terwards until Chri&s;t, in and by whom this Prediction and Promi&s;e was mo&s;t fully ac|compli&s;hed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pool.</NOTE> The advancement of pure and undefiled Religion is the great End and highe&s;t Honour of Civil Government.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The refre&s;hing Influence of his Govern|ment, metaphorically &s;et forth; <HI>He &s;hall come down like Rain upon the mown Gra&s;s: as Show|ers that water the Earth.</HI> Whereas cruel Ty|rants are like Storms of Wind and Hail, that de&s;troy the Fruits of the Earth, <HI>Solomon</HI>'s ju&s;t and wi&s;e, kind and gentle Admini&s;tration, would be like the Rain that di&s;tils on the Gra&s;s, and cau&s;eth it to &s;pring again after it has been mowed; like the &s;weet Showers that water the Earth, and make all the Fruits of it to revive and look plea&s;ant. <HI>In his days &s;hall the righteous flouri&s;h.</HI> So when <HI>Job</HI> &s;at Chief, and dwelt as a King in the Army,
<PB N="9" REF="003282_0007_0FF03DB096278628">and cho&s;e out the way of the People, <HI>they waited for him as for the Rain, and they open|ed their Mouths wide as for the latter Rain.</HI> Job 29.23. Good Government is like the Rain, comfortable and beneficial; the Fruits produced thereby are alike grateful and plea|&s;ant.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. The large Extent and va&s;t Riches of his Kingdom; <HI>He &s;hall have dominion al&s;o from Sea to Sea,</HI> (from the red to the medi|terranean Sea) <HI>and from the River</HI> (Euphra|tes) <HI>unto the ends of the Earth.</HI> The utmo&s;t bounds of the Land towards <HI>Egypt. Solomon</HI> reigned over all Kingdoms, from the River unto the Land of the <HI>Phili&s;tines,</HI> and unto the border of <HI>Egypt.</HI> 1 Kin. 4.21. <HI>They that dwell in the Wilderne&s;s &s;hall bow before him: and his Enemies &s;hall lick the du&s;t,</HI> in token of humble &s;ubjection to him. <HI>The Kings of Tar|&s;hi&s;h and of the I&s;les &s;hall bring Pre&s;ents: the Kings of Sheba and Seba &s;hall offer Gifts: Tea, all Kings &s;hall fall down before him: all Na|tions &s;hall &s;erve him.</HI> This was hyperboli|cally &s;poken of <HI>Solomon,</HI> that all Kings &s;hall fall down before him, and all Nations &s;erve him: but it may be &s;trictly applied to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and &s;hall be literally verified in him, the Prince of the Kings of the Earth, at who&s;e Name every Knee under Heaven &s;hall bow.&mdash; <HI>He &s;hall live,</HI> i. e. long and pro&s;perou&s;ly, as <HI>Solomon</HI> did, <HI>and to him &s;hall be given of the

<HEAD><HI>Prop I.</HI> That Prayer &s;hould continually be made for the Ruler of a People.</HEAD>
<P>To pray continually, is, according as the Phra&s;e is u&s;ed in Scripture, to give one's &s;elf to Prayer, to pray very frequently, in all
<PB N="11" REF="003282_0009_0FF03DB6544D0198">fit Sea&s;ons, and with un&s;ainting per&s;everance. And thus is the Ruler of a People to be prayed for by them. King <HI>Solomon</HI>'s People did no more than was their Duty, when Prayer was made by them for him continu|ally.</P>
<P>Our &s;trict Obligation to, the great Impor|tance, Rea&s;onablene&s;s and Advantage of this religious and loyal Practice, may ea&s;ily be demon&s;trated.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Will</HI> of the univer&s;al <HI>Sovereign,</HI> almighty Law-giver and Judge, revealed in the Scriptures, hath made it the indi&s;pen&s;a|ble and unque&s;tionable Duty of a People to pray continually for their Ruler, or Rulers under him. The declared Will of God is the Mea&s;ure and Ground of our Duty, and &s;hould be the Rea&s;on and Motive of our Obedience. His Commandment is exceeding broad: It extends to all the Relations, civil, &s;acred, and dome&s;tic, which Men &s;u&s;tain, and en|joins and urgeth every Duty belonging there|unto. Among the Duties required in his Word, of a People toward a Magi&s;trate, this is undeniably one, that they pray continual|ly for him. We are commanded to <HI>pray for all Men,</HI> and con&s;equently for tho&s;e that rule over us. By what is &s;aid in our <HI>Text,</HI> the People of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were admoni&s;h'd of, and ob|lig'd to this their Duty toward <HI>Solomon,</HI> to make continual Prayer for him. The Words
<PB N="12" REF="003282_0010_0FF03DB8C6B1C690">of the <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> 1 Tim. 2.1, 2, 3. plainly &s;hew what the Will of <HI>God</HI> is concerning this Practice: <HI>I exhort therefore,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>that fir&s;t of all Supplications, Prayers, Interce&s;&s;ions, and giving of Thanks be made for all Men: For Kings, and for all that are in Authority.&mdash; For this is good and acceptable in the &s;ight of God our Saviour.</HI> It is <HI>good,</HI> being agreeable to the Will and Commandment of God; and <HI>acceptable in his &s;ight,</HI> becau&s;e enjoined by his Law. The Service which plea&s;eth him is pre&s;cribed by him. In vain do we wor&s;hip him otherwi&s;e than according to his Appoint|ment. It is therefore the good and accepta|ble Will of God, that we &s;hould pray, as for all Men, &s;o particularly for tho&s;e in Autho|rity.</P>
<P N="2">2. In regard to the <HI>publick Good,</HI> Prayer &s;hould continually be made for the Ruler of a People. The State of a People is com|monly pro&s;perous or adver&s;e, according as their Rulers are good or bad. The &s;afety of the Common-Wealth very much depends on the Skill and Faithfulne&s;s of tho&s;e who &s;it at Helm, and &s;teer its Affairs. As Rulers were ordained for this End, &s;o they are in the highe&s;t Capacity to advance the publick Weal; and they have al&s;o the greate&s;t Pow|er and Opportunities to ob&s;truct the &s;ame. The Peace and Pro&s;perity, the Glory and Happine&s;s, which a ju&s;t and religious Go|vernment
<PB N="13" REF="003282_0011_0FF03DBA5D51D430">brings to a People, the Spirit of the Lord declares by the Mouth of <HI>David,</HI> 2 Sam. 23. 3, 4. <HI>The God of I&s;rael &s;aid, the Rock of I&s;rael &s;pake to me. He that ruleth over Men mu&s;t be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God: And he &s;hall be as the light of the Morning, when the Sun ri&s;eth, even a Morning without Clouds; as the tender Gra&s;s &s;pringing out of the Earth by clear &s;hining after Rain.</HI></P>
<P>Rulers are the light of a People, and as when the Sun &s;hineth brightly, there is a plea&s;ant Day over the face of the Earth, &s;o when they &s;hine with Wi&s;dom, Ju&s;tice, Meekne&s;s and the like, and &s;hed abroad the reviving Rays and benign Influences of good Govern|ment, there is a chearful Day of Pro&s;perity enjoyed; truly their Light is &s;weet. But if they are over clouded with Ignorance and Vice, there is commonly much Darkne&s;s upon a People, and a melancholly &s;tate of things to be &s;een. If they know not, nei|ther will under&s;tand, but walk on in Dark|ne&s;s, unrighteous and mi&s;chievous Cour&s;es, all the Foundations of the Earth are out of Cour&s;e: And if the Foundations be de&s;troy|ed, what can the righteous do?&mdash; Religion flouri&s;heth or decayeth in a Kingdom or Country, according as Rulers &s;hew them|&s;elves affected thereto in their Conver&s;ati|ons. Their Examples are u&s;ually more influ|ential on the Morals of People, than their Laws. And therefore, &s;ince Righteou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="14" REF="003282_0012_0FF03DBCA939DD10">exalteth a Nation, and Sin is the Reproach and Ruin of a People, it is of un&s;peakable Con&s;equence to them, that their Rulers be Men fearing God, walking before them as their Guides in all paths of Vertue. The Pi|ety of Rulers deriveth many Ble&s;&s;ings on a People, and their Wickedne&s;s involves them in Mi&s;ery, and pulls down the &s;ore&s;t Judg|ments on a Land, as the Hi&s;tory of the Kings of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and <HI>Judah</HI> &s;heweth, and the Experi|ence of all Ages may atte&s;t. <HI>God</HI> often deals with a People as their Rulers do good or evil in his &s;ight. <HI>David</HI> was an eminent Saint, <HI>a. Man after God's own Heart,</HI> and remarkable Pro&s;perity did attend his Reign: Yea, the Land of <HI>Judah</HI> far'd the better for that good King after he was dead. "How often did God profe&s;s for his Servant <HI>David</HI>'s &s;ake to pre&s;erve <HI>Judah</HI> from De&s;truction?"</P>
<P>When the King of <HI>A&s;&s;yria,</HI> in <HI>Hezekiah</HI>'s time, was coming with a mighty Ho&s;t again&s;t <HI>Jeru&s;alem, God</HI> &s;aid, <HI>I will defend this City to &s;ave it, for mine own &s;ake, and far my Servant David's &s;ake,</HI> I&s;a. 37.35. On the other hand, the In&s;tances of <HI>God</HI>'s Vengance on a People for the Sins of their Rulers are many. Be|cau&s;e <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh</HI> King of <HI>Judah</HI> did wickedly above all that the <HI>Amorites</HI> did, therefore <HI>the Lord &s;tretched over Jeru&s;alem the Line of Sa|maria, and the Plunament of the Hou&s;e of Ahab.</HI> Among all the Iniquities which drew down &s;uch heavy Judgments upon the Land of
<PB N="15" REF="003282_0013_0FF03DBEF1BA4538"><HI>Judah,</HI> the Sins of <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh</HI> are reckon'd the chief, the mo&s;t provoking Cau&s;e. His Coun|try felt the ill Effects of his Wickedne&s;s after his Death, notwith&s;tanding his Humiliation and Repentance. When <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> wrought &s;uch a notable Reformation, it is &s;aid, <HI>Not|with&s;tanding the Lord turned not from the fiercene&s;s of his Wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled again&s;t Judah, becau&s;e of all the Pro|vocations that Mana&s;&s;eh had provoked him withal.</HI> 2 Kin. 23.26 <HI>God</HI> avenged <HI>Saul</HI>'s per|fidious Cruelty toward the <HI>Gibeonites</HI> with a triennial Famine after his decea&s;e, 2 Sam. 21.1. <HI>There was a Famine in the Days of Da|vid three Years, Year after Year: And David enquired of the Lord, and the Lord an&s;wered, it is for Saul, and for his bloody Hou&s;e, becau&s;e he &s;lew the Gibeonites.</HI> Not only the gro&s;s Iniquities of vicious Rulers, but al&s;o the Faults and Mi&s;carriages of tho&s;e that are pious, are the Cau&s;e, or at lea&s;t the Occa|&s;ion of God's inflicting Judgments on their People. When good King <HI>David,</HI> in fit of Pride, numbred his People, 'tis expre&s;ly &s;aid, 1 Chr. 21.7. <HI>God was di&s;plea&s;ed with this thing, therefore he &s;mote I&s;rael.</HI> So <HI>God</HI> vi&s;ited the Pride and Ingratitude of <HI>Hezekiah</HI> upon his Subjects, 2 Chr. 32.25. <HI>Hezekiah ren|dred not again according to the Benefit done un|to him, for his Heart was lifted up: therefore there was Wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jeru&s;alem. God's</HI> Way is equal in this pro|ceeding,
<PB N="16" REF="003282_0014_0FF03DC15BF91260">tho' Men are apt to be &s;tumbled at it: Yea, <HI>David</HI> him&s;elf &s;eems to &s;peak as if He thought, it otherwi&s;e, 1 Chr. 21.17. <HI>David &s;aid unto God, Is it not I that command|ed the People to be numbred? even I it is that have finned and done evil indeed; but as for the&s;e Sheep, what have they done? let thine Hand, I pray thee, O Lord my God, be on me, and on my Father's Hou&s;e, but not on thy Peo|ple, that they &s;hould be plagued.</HI> Rulers are political <HI>Fathers</HI> of their People, and God righteou&s;ly <HI>vi&s;its the Iniquities of Fathers up|on Children,</HI> unto the third and fourth Gene|ration. Ex. 20.5. Not that <HI>God</HI> arbitrarily inflicts unde&s;erved Puni&s;hment on any: He never puni&s;heth a People more than their own Iniquities de&s;erve: But he might exer|ci&s;e more Patience toward them; His Anger would not break out &s;o &s;oon, nor burn &s;o fiercely, were it not for the Provocations of the&s;e their Fathers. The holy <HI>God,</HI> that he might engage People to do all that in them lieth, to prevent the Corruption of Rulers, and the more deter Rulers from Sin, doth in the Cour&s;e of his Providence vi&s;it the Iniqui|ties of Rulers upon People.</P>
<P>From all which it is evident, that the pub|lick Good calls for Prayer to be made con|tinually for the Rulers of a People; that they may be wi&s;e as Angels of God, impartially ju&s;t, and truly religous, inclin'd to all Vertue, and re&s;train'd from all Sin. In praying for
<PB N="17" REF="003282_0015_0FF03DC429502048">tho&s;e in Authority, we pray for the <HI>peace of Jeru&s;alem,</HI> the pro&s;perity of the <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State:</HI> We exerci&s;e and expre&s;s Love to our Country, and a due Concern for the publick Welfare. If by Prayer we obtain God's Ble&s;|&s;ing upon Rulers, we procure his Favour to the Land, and take the &s;horte&s;t and mo&s;t ef|fectual Way of furthering the publick Good. We are exhorted to <HI>pray for Kings and all in Authority,</HI> on this Account, for this End, <HI>that we may lead a quiet and peaceable Life in all Godline&s;s and Hone&s;ty.</HI> Would a People live, and enjoy Quietne&s;s and Pro&s;perity? Would they have any Hone&s;ty or Godline&s;s found among&s;t them? then let them pray for all in Authority. They &s;hew them&s;elves true Friends to the publick Intere&s;t, who pray continually for the Rulers of a People: and thus it may be advanced by tho&s;e who can|not in any other way be Serviceable thereun|to. As without praying for our &s;elves, we can have no ground to expect per&s;onal Fa|vours; &s;o without praying for Rulers we cannot rea&s;onably hope for publick Ble&s;&s;ings. We ought to pray for all Men; and we do &s;o, and for all kind of Ble&s;&s;ings in their be|half, when we pray for Kings, and all that are in Authority.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Law of <HI>Gratitude</HI> obligeth People continually to pray for their Rulers. They that exerci&s;e Authority upon Men are called

<P N="6">6. Continual Prayer made for the Ruler of a People tends to <HI>engage</HI> and <HI>influence</HI> them to di&s;charge their <HI>whole Duty</HI> to him. Men having revolted from <HI>God,</HI> they are naturally aver&s;e from honouring of, and &s;ubmitting to his Authority which Rulers are ve&s;ted with, and are prone to carry irreverently, froward|ly and &s;tubbornly toward their lawful Ma|gi&s;trates: Having practically renounced Al|legiance to the glorious King of all, they are unwilling to yield due Re&s;pect unto his Offi|cers and Vice-gerents. Not being in &s;ub|jection to the original Power of the Creator, they do not readily obey the derivative Pow|er of earthly Governours.</P>
<P>Now what better and more effectual Means can People u&s;e to mortify that Corruption in them, which prompts them to undutiful Be|haviour toward their Rulers, than to pray continually for them? The &s;incere practice of this Duty would have a mighty Influence into all the re&s;t which they owe to &s;uch as are in Authority, and make them &s;ubject to the Powers that be ordained of God, and move them to <HI>render Tribute to whom Tribute is due, Cu&s;tom to whom Cu&s;tom, Fear to whom Fear, Honour to whom Honour.</HI> If we &s;incerely pray that Rulers may be faithful in the di&s;|charge of <HI>their</HI> Duty, we &s;hall be &s;eriou&s;ly
<PB N="24" REF="003282_0022_0FF03DD469BB5980">concern'd that we may be &s;o in the perform|ance of <HI>ours.</HI> If we earne&s;tly pray for the &s;ucce&s;s of their Admini&s;trations, we &s;hall be forward to contribute what we are able thereunto. This would keep the Hearts of People well di&s;po&s;ed toward their Rulers, and prevent or cure all Tho'ts and De&s;ires of invading their Prerogatives, infringing their Rights, and impeding their Government. Prayer is the exerci&s;e of holy Love; and Ex|erci&s;e increa&s;eth and confirmeth Habits; and <HI>Love is the fulfilling of the Law.</HI> If People are ill affected to their Rulers, Con&s;cience will accu&s;e them of Hypocri&s;y in praying for them: and &s;o either their Prayers will be hindered by their evil Di&s;po&s;itions, or el&s;e the&s;e will be extingui&s;hed by their Prayers.</P>
<P>Thus it is a plain and important Duty, a rea&s;onable Service, an excellent, commend|able and u&s;eful Practice, which is &s;poken of in our Text, as that which &s;hould be ob|&s;erv'd with re&s;pect to a Civil Ruler, <HI>Prayer &s;hall be made for him continually.</HI></P>

<P>Indeed Magi&s;trates are not to be flatter'd in their Vices, nor prai&s;ed for what they do ami&s;s: They who are to reprove in the Gate, &s;hould not fear their Faces, nor &s;pare their Sins: But People &s;hould not aggravate their Faults, nor ra&s;hly cen&s;ure their Decrees and Acts, which they apprehend to be Er|rors in Government.

<P>But tho' good Rulers don't make the prai&s;e of Men their great Aim, or &s;eek it as <HI>their Reward,</HI> yet they value an Intere&s;t in the <HI>E&s;teem</HI> and <HI>Affections</HI> of their People, which their prai&s;ing of them declares; and it is an Encouragement and Comfort to them in all their Cares and Labours for the Publick, to fee People fatisfied with, and thankful for their Admini&s;trations. <HI>Prov. 27.21. As the fining Pot for Silver, and the Fur|nace for Gold; &s;o is a Man to his Prai&s;e.</HI> If a Man be wi&s;e and good, he is by his prai&s;e made better, more thankful to God, more re|&s;pectful to Men, more watchful again&s;t every thing that may blemi&s;h his Reputation, more diligent to improve him&s;elf, and do good to

<P>And certainly much Prai&s;e is due unto good Rulers from an obliged People: It is a <HI>ju&s;t Debt</HI> they owe to their Protectors and Benefactors.

"I mu&s;t ob&s;erve (&s;aid a holy Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, who liv'd in &s;ome of the unhappy Reigns in <HI>England</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr.</HI> Baxter.</NOTE>) that mo&s;t Chri&s;tians are &s;o cold and formal in their Prayers for the Rulers of the World, and of the Church, that we have great Rea&s;on to impute the Unhappine&s;s of Governours, very much to their neglect: Almo&s;t all Men (&s;ays he) are taken up &s;o much with their own Concernments, that they put off the publick Concernments of the World, and of the Church and State, with a few cu&s;tomary heartle&s;s Words; and un|der&s;tand not the meaning of the three fir&s;t Petitions of the <HI>Lord's Prayer,</HI> and the Rea|&s;on of their precedency, or put them not up with that feeling, as they do the other three. If we could once ob&s;erve, that the generality of Chri&s;tians were more earne&s;t and impor|tunate with God, for <HI>the hallowing of his Name thro all the World, and the coming of his King|dom,
<PB N="35" REF="003282_0033_0FF03DEE460CF340">and the obeying of his Will in Earth, as it is in Heaven, and the Conver&s;ion of the Kings and Kingdoms of the World,</HI> than for any of their per&s;onal Concernments, I &s;hould take it for a better Progno&s;tick of the Happine&s;s of Kings and Kingdoms, than any that hath yet appeared in our Days".</P>
<P>O that this Duty might be better con&s;ider|ed and ob&s;erved by us than hitherto it has been!</P>
<P>Let our Rulers have our &s;incere Prai&s;es, as well as fervent Prayers. They are &s;ent by God, <HI>for the prai&s;e of them that do well,</HI> 1 Pet. 2. 14. and we are ungrateful indeed to &s;uch Benefactors, if we don't make the &s;mall Re|turns of our Prai&s;e to them, and accept of their very worthy Deeds for the publick Weal, with great Thankfulne&s;s. And if we pray, as we ought, continually for tho&s;e in Autho|rity, we &s;hall have more Occa&s;ion and Incen|tive daily to prai&s;e them, and to ble&s;s God for them.</P>
<P>I conclude the pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e with the Words that <HI>David the Son of Je&s;&s;e</HI> did his Prophecy concerning <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Government, which was a Type of Chri&s;t's, and al&s;o his Prayers, in the clo&s;e of this P&s;alm [And you all join in the Doxology, Interce&s;&s;ion, and double Amen] <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord God, the God of I&s;rael, who only doth wondrous things. And ble&s;&s;ed be his glorious Name for ever, and let the whole Earth be filled with his Glory. Amen, and Amen.</HI></P>
