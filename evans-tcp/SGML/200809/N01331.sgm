<OPENER><SALUTE>Friendly &amp; Chri&s;tian Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS we believe it to be the Expre&s;s Command of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour <HI>Matth. 5.34 Not to swear at all,</HI> and that therefore we refu&s;e to &s;wear in any ca&s;e &s;o it is chiefly the Subject of the following undertaking to &s;hew that our Te&s;timony therein is truly con&s;istent with the harmonious Belief and Te&s;timony of divers Primitive Chri&s;tians, famous Fathers godly Martyrs &amp; learned Prote&s;tants, leaving behind for brevity &s;ake many more that might be in&s;tanced: for though Chri&s;tianity hath &s;u&s;tained a great Degeneracy in this and al&s;o many other things, yet there was often found many of great Account in the Church Godly Witne&s;&s;es that kept up and bore a faithful Te&s;timony to the Doctrine of our Lord in this Matter.</P>
<P>Our Te&s;timonies are ab&s;tracted and taken from a book called a Treati&s;e of Oaths, as mentioned in the Title Page in which book our Friends Rea&s;ons again&s;t Swearing in any Ca&s;e are largely &s;et forth and then fortified with divers Te&s;timonies of excellent Men &amp; Chri&s;tians; but that it may not &s;well too bulky we at pre&s;ent chu&s;e to collect &amp; ab&s;tract &s;uch of them as appear most &s;uitable to our pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Pages of the &s;aid book are &s;et down at the End of each <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i|tation that they may readily as well as more at large be found.</P>
<P>Our de&s;ire in this Work is fir&s;t to inform tho&s;e who among our &s;elves may be ignorant how our Chri&s;tian Doctrine hath been kept to and maintained by the mo&s;t Antient, as well as modern Christians. Secondly, that tho&s;e our Neighbours and others who are not of our Per&s;wa&s;ion in this ca&s;e and may think &s;ometimes them&s;elves un&s;afe under our plain Affirma|tion, may &s;ee that the &s;entiments of their &amp; our Predece&s;&s;ors,

called Fathers in the Church (in Re&s;pect to Chri&s;t's Prohibi|tion, and of the little Security there is in Oaths) were exactly one with us in this matter.</P>
<P>And we de&s;ire our Neighbours to con&s;ider, that our Pen&s;ilvania plain Attest (to wit) <HI>I &s;olemnly promi&s;e &amp;c.</HI> we had in the beginning of our Settlement <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">here, and afterwards by Law E&s;tabli&s;hed by Coll. <HI>Fletcher,</HI> and was confirm'd by <HI>King William,</HI> and was practi&s;ed among us, before and &s;ince, that time for about twenty years, with|out any known Prejudice to any one, either in Per&s;on or E&s;tate: and until an Order from the <HI>Queen</HI> was procured to put in practice the Engli&s;h Affirmation.</P>
<P>We al&s;o think it pertinent to this pre&s;ent work to de&s;ire all to con&s;ider, that in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> the <HI>Meni&s;ts,</HI> who are a con&s;iderable Body of &s;ober Religious People, and who cann't for Con&s;cience &s;ake take an Oath, nor, as is &s;aid bear A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ms. are, and have been tolerated among them, for about <HI>130</HI> years, last past, yet do not find any prejudice, or inconveniency in that Re&s;pect, to their Commonwealth, Trade or Commerce. And that they were &s;o tolerated, appears by Letters &s;ent from the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> to the Inhabitants of <HI>Middelburgh,</HI> part of one of which Letters is as followeth the &s;aid Prince ha|ving first &s;hewed that the &s;aid People &s;upplicated him for Re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ef in re&s;pect to Oaths, &s;aith thus, &mdash;
<Q>Seeing they do there|in not de&s;ire any thing el&s;e, than to live in the Liberty of their Con&s;ciences, upon which Account this pre&s;ent war again&s;t the King of <HI>Spain</HI> hath been by his Subjects ta|ken up, &amp; all Ceremonies contrary thereunto re&s;i&s;ted: in which &s;uch Advance is, through the help of God, made, that the afore&s;aid Liberty of Con&s;cience is pre&s;erved, and

therefore it would be an unequal thing to deprive the Supplicants thereof who have helped to acquire the &s;ame by bearing Taxes, Contributions and other Burthens &amp;c. E&s;pecially &s;eeing the afore&s;aid Petitioners do proffer, that their Yea pa&s;&s;ing for an Oath, the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or &s;hall be puni&s;hed as Oath&mdash;breakers; therefore his Excellency having con&s;idered the premi&s;&s;es, and having maturely de|liberated upon the &s;ame, hath, with the previous Advice of the Governour and Council of <HI>Zealand,</HI> Ordered that the afore&s;aid Petitioners <HI>Yea,</HI> &s;hall be received, by the Ma|gi&s;trates of the afore&s;aid City in&s;tead of an Oath, pro|vided, the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors &s;hall be puni&s;hed as Oathbreakers. <BIBL>Page 162.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>This was done in the year <HI>1577,</HI> and we hear nothing but they continue &s;o to this day &mdash; And in <HI>Hoo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t's</HI> Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> we find one <HI>Lord &amp;c.

<Q>That the&s;e men's Yea mu&s;t pa&s;s for an Oath, or we mu&s;t confe&s;s that the Papi&s;ts had Rea&s;on enough to force us to a Religion contrary to our Con|&s;cien'ces.</Q></P>
<P>Al&s;o in a Treaty of peace, between the States General, Kings of Spain, England &amp;c. <HI>Anno 1674</HI> there is a Special Article that all Ship Ma&s;ters of Merchant &s;hips &s;hall carry along with them a &s;ea Brief, declaring that the Ma&s;ter did upon Oath te&s;tifie that &s;uch &s;hip did properly belong &amp;c. &mdash; Yet the &s;olemn Affirmation of tho&s;e who cannot &s;ware is there taken in&s;tead of an Oath, and then their Certificate runs thus, viz.

<P>From which it is ob&s;ervable, That though tho&s;e People cannot <HI>&s;wear,</HI> no, nor bear Arms, yet paying their Taxes and Contribu|tions (as they declared in their &s;aid Supplication they had freely done equal with others,) they had free Liberty to dwell, trade and merchandize among them, upon their bear Yea and Nay, or upon their plain and &s;olemn Affirming or Declaring this or that, with|out

any Oath, they &s;uffering for the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion thereof as Oath breakers. <HI>Note,</HI> &s;o it is by Law E&s;tabli&s;hed with us in Pen&s;ilvania, and indeed we remember not in &s;cripture, any greater puni&s;h|ment threat'ned again&s;t perjured per&s;ons than again&s;t liars; for all liars are to have part in the lake that burns with fire and brim&s;tone, <HI>Revel 21 8.</HI> Since, therefore, not only God's holy Law, but al&s;o our own human Law, gives as great puni&s;hment to liars as to per|jured Per&s;ons, what &s;hould then Induce any man to break his &s;o|lemn Word, more than to break his Oath.</P>

<P>Here is plain Scripture Te&s;timony where the Onene&s;s is, tho' &s;everal Nations, Male or Female, yet all One in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>But now we &s;ee many are Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, that are not one; but one again&s;t another, every one &s;ay|ing <HI>My Way is Right, &amp; Thine is Wrong.</HI></P>
<P>What &s;hall we do in this Ca&s;e, to be of one Body? how came the Chri&s;tians in the primitive times to be of one Body, of one Heart, and of one Soul? Will not the &s;ame thing do now, as did then, if we would Receive it?</P>
<P>What is that? (may &s;ome &s;ay) <HI>It is the Spirit: for by one Spirit were all Baptized into One Body;</HI> whether they were Jews or Gentiles Bond or Free, they were all made to drink into one Spirit, 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.13.</P>
<P>Now if all that profe&s;s Chri&s;tianity, would come to this one Spirit, and &s;o be Baptized by this one Spirit, it would &s;oon end the Controver&s;ie.</P>
