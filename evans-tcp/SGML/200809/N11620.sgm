<P>AN ATTEMPT To nip in the Bud, the un&s;criptural Doctrine of UNIVERSAL SALVATION, and &s;ome other dan|gerous Errors connected with it; which a cer|tain STRANGER, who calls him&s;elf JOHN MUR|RAY, has, of late, been endeavoring to &s;pread in the Fir&s;t Pari&s;h of GLOUCESTER, to draw away Di&s;ciples after him.</P>

<P>IT is now about a year &s;ince the following Letter was &s;ent to the late <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> Printers&mdash;ho&s;tilities commencing &s;oon after, by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> troops again&s;t the <HI>Americans,</HI> opened &s;uch a &s;cene of bu&s;ine&s;s, &amp;c. as hitherto to prevent it's publication.</P>
<P>The Author, though he looks upon the followers of the <HI>Stranger,</HI> herein referred to, to be under a &s;ad and &s;orrowful delu&s;ion, yet has a benevolent affection to them, and his daily prayer to God for them is, that they may be undeceived in time and made wi&s;e, un|to eternal &s;alvation; and earne&s;tly prays them to read the following Letter with unprejudiced attention and an hone&s;t de&s;ire to know the Truth: "It is no more their intere&s;t than the Author's to be de|ceived." Nay, if the doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation, or of the final happine&s;s of all men is true, we run no hazard in denying it to be true; we &s;hall as cer|tainly be &s;aved and finally happy, as tho&s;e will who avouch it, and enter heaven at death without going through purgatory or their <HI>intermediate &s;tate,</HI> pro|vided we are <HI>wa&s;hed and &s;anctified and ju&s;tified in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, and by the Spirit of God,</HI> be|fore we die; which the advocates for univer&s;al &s;al|vation mu&s;t allow we may&mdash;without believing their doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation to be true; otherwi&s;e deny there are, or ever were any true Chri&s;tians&mdash; any born of God in this life, but tho&s;e that believe

What if you have been given up to a &s;trong delu&s;ion to believe a lie? Where will the &s;in|ner&mdash;Where will the unbeliever, the impenitent, the profane, the ungodly apppear? Will it be your in|tere&s;t in this ca&s;e to be deceived? If your doctrine of the final happine&s;s of all mankind is true, the Bible is not true! Let common &s;en&s;e &s;peak, yea let Dei&s;ts and Infidels &s;ay, whether they do not with one con&s;ent acknowledge that the Bible teaches in an open and expre&s;s manner, that the unbeliever, the ungodly and impenitent, dying &s;uch, &s;hall be pu|ni&s;hed with an everla&s;ting de&s;truction?

<P>BY a benevolent affection to you and others you now a&s;&s;ociate your&s;elf with to attend the mi|ni&s;trations of the <HI>Stranger</HI> lately come into your Town, and from a &s;erious concern for the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t and glory of God, I am moved to write a few things, which, I pray you and others concerned to take under proper con&s;ideration, viz.</P>

<P N="2">II. That it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that we be born of the Spirit&mdash;have repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>

<HI>wicked</HI> of <HI>all nations,</HI> and that as the righteous &s;hall go away into life eternal, &s;o the wicked &s;hall into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, repre&s;ented by fire unquenchable or everla&s;ting!&mdash;Now he that will do &s;uch violence to the meaning of &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of &s;acred &s;cripture to e&s;tabli&s;h a particular tenet, would do violence to every pa&s;&s;age to &s;erve a turn, and thereby proves him&s;elf to be an infidel, and hence that he never embraced this doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation from a conviction of divine authority for it, but becau&s;e it was agreable to corrupt nature: Men that do not like to deny them&s;elves and take up their cro&s;s daily in following Chri&s;t&mdash; that do not chu&s;e to have Chri&s;t to reign over them, nor to keep his com|mandments, would be glad to per&s;uade them&s;elves of enjoying happine&s;s hereafter without pa&s;&s;ing the &s;trait gate into the narrow way of holine&s;s and &s;elf-denial, even in the broad way that the multitude goes in to do evil; for what wicked man is there that would not heartily like to &s;erve the devil all his days, or the de&s;ires of the fle&s;h and of the mind, and would not do it, if he could per&s;uade him&s;elf that he &s;hould be happy for all this, or &s;hould not &s;uffer for it in the coming world?&mdash;And they that have fallen in with this per&s;ua&s;ion, commonly advance this argument for it; "That God is a merciful Being" and therefore for him to damn any of mankind forever would be incon&s;i&s;tent with the goodne&s;s of his nature, and imply that he made creatures to damn them, which is a thought they cannot entertain of &s;o good a Being:&mdash;Which nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es &s;everal things, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. That devils will either be finally happy, or el&s;e, as they are crea|tures as much as &s;inful men, God created them to damn them forever: By the way, God made angels and men for his glory; but fallen angels and fallen men have fitted them&s;elves for de&s;truction.</P>
<P N="2">2. That there was no need of the &s;acrifice or atonement of Chri&s;t, in order for our di&s;charge from condemnation; for if it was incon&s;i&s;tent with the nature of divine goodne&s;s to puni&s;h us with everla&s;ting de&s;truc|tion for our &s;ins, what need could there be of Chri&s;t's dying for us to re|deem us from the cur&s;e of the la<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">, and deliver us from the wrath which is to come, that we were condemned unto? Yea, how came God to condemn us to everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, if it was incon&s;i&s;tent with the nature of his goodne&s;s to inflict it upon us? Or if it was not an everla&s;ting puni&s;hment that Chri&s;t died to redeem us from, what was it?&mdash;Only a temporal puni&s;hment, which would have had an end, though he had not died for us! Then Chri&s;t died in vain, and the Dei&s;ts are right, and the bible is a book of non-&s;en&s;e!&mdash;If I were to em|brace this new doctrine I would be &s;o hone&s;t and con&s;i&s;tent with my&s;elf, as at the &s;ame time to fling away the bible, for it is impo&s;&s;ible to recon|cile it with the bible-religion, let common &s;en&s;e be judge.</P>
<P N="3">3. That tho&s;e per&s;ons, who plead the above argument, have no proper conviction and &s;en&s;e of the moral rectitude of God, his moral law and government&mdash;of the nature, evil, and demerit of &s;in&mdash;of the nature of the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;in and of &s;alvation from it, nor of the nature and nece&s;&s;ity of the atonement by Chri&s;t in order to the &s;ame.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="014684_0043_0F948D5A83C63F60">In a word, that cannot be true chri&s;tian doctrine, but <HI>damnable here&s;y,</HI> which makes &s;ad the hearts of the godly, as it encourages wicked and vicious per&s;ons to live without fear of eternal puni&s;hment, in the neglect of repentance&mdash;of their own &s;alvation&mdash;of <HI>religion and virtue, in the prac|tice of every vice.</HI></P>
<P>The following anecdote was communicated to me by a per&s;on of repu|tation, who a&s;&s;ured me that there was good authority for the truth of it, viz.</P>
<P>Turning to a part of his audience, where a number of privateers-men were &s;wearing at one another, &s;aid, "Well, you may go on and drink and &s;wear and damn your fellow-men and bla&s;pheme your Maker and think to di&s;honor him; but you do not di&s;honor him at all; you only magnify his grace and di&s;play the merits of Chri&s;t &s;o much the more."&mdash; Huzza! Good doctrine for privateers-men! cried out a certain C&mdash; of a privateer.</P>
<P>It would not be acting out of character in the lea&s;t for that per&s;on to addre&s;s vicious per&s;ons in &s;uch a manner, who a&s;&s;erts and endeavors to propagate, that all men &s;hall finally be happy, and that the mo&s;t vicious and criminal per&s;ons are beloved of God, if not as much beloved of God, while in the practice of &s;in, as after they become penitent and virtuous.&mdash; Query 1. Whether &s;uch a teacher is not a mini&s;ter of &s;atan, an encourag|er of vice and irreligion, and an enemy to virtue and pure religion? Query 2. Whether &s;uch a teacher ought not to be taken care of by au|thority as an enemy to mankind and a bane to civil &s;ociety? "Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation, but &s;in is a reproach to any people;&mdash;one &s;in|ner de&s;troyeth much good&mdash;Let not an evil &s;peaker be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the earth."&mdash;God &s;aw, in certain pretended prophets of Jeru&s;alem, "an horrible thing; they commit adultery, and walk in lies; they <HI>&s;trengthen</HI> al&s;o the hands of <HI>evil-doers</HI> that <HI>none doth return from his wickedne&s;s</HI>; they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomor|rah. Therefore, thus &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts concerning (tho&s;e) prophets, Behold, I will feed them with wormwood and make them drink the wa|ter of gall; for from (the&s;e) prophets of Jeru&s;alem is PROFANENESS <HI>gone forth into all the land.</HI>&mdash;Thus &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts, <HI>hearken not</HI> un|to the words of (the&s;e) prophets, that prophe&s;y unto you; THEY MAKE YOU VAIN; they <HI>&s;peak a vi&s;ion of their own heart,</HI> and <HI>not out of the mouth</HI> of the Lord; they &s;ay &s;till unto them that de&s;pi&s;e me, the Lord hath &s;aid, YE SHALL HAVE PEACE; and they &s;ay unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, NO EVIL SHALL COME UPON YOU."
