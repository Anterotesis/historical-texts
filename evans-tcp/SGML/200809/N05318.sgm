<OPENER><SALUTE>Honorable, Reverend and Beloved,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN the &s;orrowful Tidings concerning the Death of his Royal Highne&s;s, THE PRINCE, reached us, and cau&s;ed the Hearts of this mo&s;t loyal People to contract and their Faces to gather a melancholy Gloom; The&s;e Words of the holy and learned Apo&s;tle came into my own pen&s;ive Mind, and engag'd for a Sea&s;on my own retired Sentiments.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="006716_0005_1029AD78C9E883A8">
There was not at that Time a &s;ingle Tho't in my Heart, that it would fall to my Lot to perform &s;uch a mournful Office for the ROYAL SON, as I was once called to undertake for his ROYAL MOTHER, the late gracious Queen CAROLINE; who&s;e Name yet lives e&s;teemed, who&s;e exalted Vertues are yet had in Re|nown, who&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed Merit is yet gratefully ap|proved and owned, and who&s;e <HI>Memory</HI> is yet, and will continue to be, <HI>ble&s;&s;ed</HI> among us.</P>
<P>But, when I perceived it to be the Appointment of his Honour, <HI>The Commander in Chief, and the Honorable His Maje&s;ty's Council</HI> for the Province, that the Reli|gious Part of the Funeral Ob&s;equies of this Day &s;hould be committed to the Tru&s;t of <HI>one,</HI> who is &s;o unmeet for it, and in all Re&s;pects &s;o unequal to it; and that, as I &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e it fell in Cour&s;e to me this Week to preach publickly; then from a Sen&s;e of Duty I &s;ubmitted to their Appointment, acquie&s;ced in their Plea&s;ure and re&s;olved in the Divine Strength to endeavor a Compli|ance with their Order and Expectation.</P>
<P>And then, The in&s;pired Pa&s;&s;age, which has been read unto us, recurred again immediately to my Mind: And, as I apprehend, that a &s;uitable Di&s;cour&s;e from it mu&s;t be &s;ea&s;onable on the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion; <HI>This</HI> is the very Thing to be now endeavored.</P>
<P>THE immediate Occa&s;ion of the Words before us was the foregoing Argument of the Apo&s;tle concerning the Rejection of the <HI>Jews</HI> for their Infidelity and Wicked|ne&s;s and the Reception of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> into the Church of the living GOD; which was <HI>a My&s;tery hidden for many Ages and Generations</HI> before the Time of the great A|po&s;tle of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> There were indeed Predictions and Prophecies of the&s;e Things in the Writings of the old Te&s;tament; which either were not under&s;tood, or if under&s;tood were not believed, by the <HI>Jews.</HI> But it was given by In&s;piration to the holy PAUL to under&s;tand the&s;e ancient Predictions and Prophecies, and to confirm them in a &s;ure and inconte&s;tible Manner.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="006716_0006_1029AD7C73BE9CD0">
And when our Apo&s;tle, towards the Clo&s;e of the pre|ceding Chapter, and throughout <HI>This</HI> before us, had written clearly concerning the Calling of the <HI>Jews</HI> at fir&s;t, and afterwards of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and a&s;&s;igned the <HI>Original Cau&s;e</HI> thereof, even the Goodne&s;s and Mercy of GOD; He then draws to a Conclu&s;ion of his whole Argument, exclaiming as in the Text, <HI>O the Depth of the Riches of the Wi&s;dom and Knowlege of GOD! How un&s;earchable are His Judgments, and His Ways pa&s;t finding out!</HI></P>
<P>In which Expre&s;&s;ions his devout and holy Soul &s;eems to be rapt up in Wonder and Amazement; or rather, according to the Figure in the Text, to be <HI>plung'd,</HI> &s;wal|lowed up and overwhelm'd with Admiration and A&s;to|ni&s;hment. <HI>O the Depth,</HI> cries He! Like one in an un|fathomable Aby&s;s, that can find no Bottom. And what is it, which is &s;o very deep? It follows here, <HI>O the Depth of the Riches both of the Wi&s;dom and Knowledge of GOD!</HI> q. d. O how profound, and of what va&s;t, as well as deep, Abundance are the <HI>Trea&s;ures of Divine Wi&s;dom and Knowledge!</HI> As the Divine Maje&s;ty perfectly <HI>knows</HI> what&s;oever comes to pa&s;s in the World; &s;o in his <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> He &s;uperintends, di&s;po&s;es and governs in all, but indeed in &s;uch a Way, and after &s;uch a Sort, as w<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to the humane Race truly wondrous and in|comprehen&s;ible: For&mdash;<HI>How Un&s;earchable are his Judg|ments, and his Ways pa&s;t finding out!</HI></P>
<P><HI>The&s;e</HI> then are the In&s;tances, which the Apo&s;tle pro|duces, wherein <HI>the un&s;earchable Riches of Divine Wi&s;|dom and Knowlege</HI> are di&s;played, namely, <HI>in the Divine Judgments and Ways.</HI></P>
<P>By <HI>the Judgments of GOD;</HI> or, as the Greek runs, TA KPIMATA, we are to under&s;tand <HI>his Decrees,</HI> &s;ays the learned <HI>Grotius:</HI> And &s;o we may take it con|cerning the Coun&s;els and Purpo&s;es of the Divine Mind with regard to <HI>Nations,</HI> as well as particular Per&s;ons: Which, tho' &s;ome imagine, that <HI>they</HI> can clearly under|&s;tand them, and hence arrogantly venture on minutely explaining them; yet they are certainly <HI>deep</HI> Things, and by the Sons of Men un&s;earchable.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="006716_0007_1029AD7DFA3D7838">
And, by <HI>the Ways of GOD,</HI> we are to under&s;tand <HI>the Foot&s;teps and Pa&s;&s;ages of his Providence</HI> in the moral Government of the World. <HI>The&s;e</HI> are <HI>His Ways, which are pa&s;t finding out.</HI> The Greek Word here, which we render <HI>pa&s;t finding out,</HI> properly &s;ignifies <HI>not to be traced,</HI> or by no di&s;tinct Marks and perfect Characters to be found. And &s;ome of the more critical Interpreters ac|quaint us, that the Term is metaphorical, and taken from &s;harp-&s;ighted and quick-&s;cented Hounds, who are apt to &s;top and pau&s;e and &s;hew them&s;elves at a Lo&s;s, when they have neither Scent nor Track of the Game which they have been pur&s;uing. And thus it is with regard to the Children of Men: For however earne&s;t, &s;harp and eager we may be to find out the Ways of the ALMIGHTY, yet <HI>we cannot trace them.</HI>&mdash;Indeed we may &s;oon perceive enough concerning them to &s;atis|fy us, that in all His Ways, in all the Foot&s;teps of His Providence, He proceeds as becometh Him; and as He has infinite Rea&s;on for all his Conduct towards Mankind; &s;o <HI>He is Righteous in all His Ways and holy in all His Doings.</HI></P>
<P>But altho' <HI>all the Divine Ways,</HI> as well as the Di|vine Coun&s;els and Purpo&s;es, be the Re&s;ult of perfect Un|der&s;tanding and unerring Rea&s;on; yet many are the Re&s;|pects and In&s;tances, wherein we cannot trace the Di|vine Conduct, nor find out the Grounds and Rea&s;ons of the Divine Di&s;pen&s;ations.</P>
<P>And now the important Truth before us is, That <HI>in the Ways of GOD,</HI> or Pa&s;&s;ages of His Providence, <HI>there is &s;uch a Depth of Divine Wi&s;dom and Knowledge as is not to be traced and inve&s;tigated by us.</HI></P>
<P>And, in order to illu&s;trate and confirm this Truth, &s;o as that by the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD it may be firmly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in your Minds; our <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Attempt &s;hall be to &s;et before you <HI>&s;ome of tho&s;e Ways of GOD, which are not to be traced and inve&s;tigated by us:</HI> And the <HI>next</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="006716_0008_1029AD8141AFF608">
&s;hall be to make it evident, that <HI>&s;uch is the Divine Wi&s;|dom and Knowlege</HI> in the&s;e Ways <HI>as is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> be traced and inve&s;tigated by us.</HI> And, having <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the&s;e Things, we &s;hall then endeavour to produce &s;uch Re|flections upon the whole as may be fit and natural and u&s;eful to us.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> Place then, we &s;hall endeavour to &s;et be|fore you <HI>tho&s;e Ways of GOD, which are not to be traced and inve&s;tigated by us.</HI></P>
<P>And here it mu&s;t be proper for us to begin with men|tioning <HI>tho&s;e Ways of GOD in calling and rejecting the</HI> Jews, <HI>and afterwards receiving the</HI> Gentiles <HI>to be His People.</HI> For <HI>The&s;e</HI> are the Ways of GOD, <HI>The&s;e</HI> the Pa&s;&s;ages of His Providence, to which our Text has an undoubted and &s;pecial Reference.</P>
<P>Why then, Sirs, was GOD plea&s;ed to call the Po&s;teri|ty of <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ke them near unto Him&s;elf, to <HI>know them above all the Families of the Earth</HI> be&s;ides, and to confer &s;ignal Advantages and Glories on them?&mdash;Was it becau&s;e they were &s;uch a numerous Peo|ple, and &s;o powerful a Nation? No verily! For they were <HI>the fewe&s;t of all People.</HI> And, at their greate&s;t Attainments of Wealth, Power and Grandeur, They were not equal to many other Kingdoms in Sub&s;tance, Strength and Extent of Dominion.&mdash;Was it then on the Account of their <HI>&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ior Piety, and &s;urpa&s;&s;ing Righteou&s;|ne&s;s,</HI> that they were &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed and honored of Heaven? No &s;urely! For they were an impious and unju&s;t Race; they were <HI>a di&s;obedient and gain-&s;aying People all the Day long,</HI> even almo&s;t from the Time of their becoming the People of GOD to the very Time of their cea&s;ing to be &s;o. And hence, after They had been <HI>His peculiar People,</HI> and even <HI>His only People,</HI> for the Space of above <HI>fifteen hundred</HI> Years; He then, for their ob&s;tinate and incurable Infidelity and Wickedne&s;s, re|jected them.&mdash;This is a mo&s;t remarkable Event, which was predicted in <HI>the Law and the Prophets:</HI> And GOD
<PB N="8" REF="006716_0009_1029AD82C33380F8">
in His governing Providence has bro't it to pa&s;s accor|dingly.</P>
<P>And now the righteous and good Governor of the World has received the <HI>Gentiles</HI> into His Church, and taken them to Him&s;elf <HI>for a peculiar People.</HI> But why? <HI>This</HI> at the fir&s;t was &s;o wondrous and amazing a Provi|dence to the <HI>chri&s;tianized Jews,</HI> that they could hardly believe it. And indeed it was &s;o &s;trange and incredible a Di&s;pen&s;ation, that they knew not how to account for it, nor cared they to admit it, tho' con&s;cious to the Certainty of the Fact.&mdash;But however it was in the cleare&s;t Manner reveled to our Apo&s;tle PAUL; and he faithfully publi&s;h|ed it in the <HI>third</HI> Chapter of his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Ephe&s;ians,</HI> as well as in the Chapter before us.</P>
<P>And <HI>what now has been the I&s;&s;ue and Con&s;equence of the&s;e</HI> un&s;earchable Ways of GOD, in rejecting the <HI>Jews</HI> and receiving the <HI>Gentiles</HI> as His People? Alas! The <HI>Former</HI> have continued in their Infidelity and Rebellion ever &s;ince; and &s;o under the Di&s;plea&s;ure of GOD, and their Rejection from Him for con&s;iderably above <HI>&s;ixteen hundred Years.</HI> And, whether They will ever again be own'd as the People of GOD, and received into his &s;pe|cial Favor and Protection; <HI>This</HI> is a Point, about which very learned and pious Men have a Diver&s;ity of Senti|ments. But, as we have no Inclination at pre&s;ent to en|ter into the Controver&s;y, we &s;hall therefore leave it.</P>
<P>Here then <HI>let the&s;e Ways of GOD,</HI> tho' <HI>un&s;earchable, yet be duly heeded</HI> by us. Let us <HI>behold the righteous Severity, and wondrous Goodne&s;s of our GOD: On them, which fell, Severity; but towards the Gentiles Goodne&s;s, if They continue in His Goodne&s;s:</HI> Otherwi&s;e what &s;hould hinder but that <HI>They &s;hould be cut off al&s;o,</HI> if they conti|nue in their Infidelity and Wickedne&s;s?</P>
<P>But, having thus noted <HI>the &s;pecial Ways of GOD, to which our Text has a peculiar Reference;</HI> we may now, as I humbly conceive, very fairly and without any Room for ju&s;t Exception, &s;peak of &s;ome other <HI>Ways of GOD, which are not to be traced and &s;earched out by us.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="006716_0010_1029AD84495897E8">
Thus, <HI>The Ways of GOD are pa&s;t finding out, when He &s;ometimes accompli&s;hes his mo&s;t holy Coun&s;els and Pur|po&s;es by &s;uch Means, and in &s;uch Ways and Manners, as are improbable, and in humans Apprehen&s;ions altogether unlikely. The Divine Ways</HI> in this Regard are <HI>not as the Ways of Men:</HI> But, <HI>as the Heavens are high above the Earth,</HI> &s;o are <HI>the Ways of GOD higher than our Ways,</HI> as well as <HI>his Tho'ts above our Tho'ts.</HI> In Pur&s;uance of his mo&s;t holy Coun&s;els, He, by &s;uch Ways and Means as appear to Men improbable, and even in their Appre|hen&s;ion impo&s;&s;ible, &s;ometimes effects Things, and pro|duces Events in the World.</P>
<P>As for In&s;tance here: <HI>It plea&s;es the &s;upreme Ruler of the World and Head of the Church to make the Pro&s;|perity of his and his People's Enemies the Occa&s;ion of their Ruin. O the Depth</HI> of this Coun&s;el! And <HI>how un&s;ear|chable are the&s;e Divine Ways!</HI> It &s;urely becomes us to admire at them; and with admiring Tho'ts, and adoring Language, to &s;ay with regard to them; <HI>O LORD GOD, How great are thy Works! Thy Tho'ts are very deep. A bruiti&s;h Man knoweth not; neither doth a Fool under|&s;tand This: When the Wicked &s;pring as the Gra&s;s, and when all the Workers of Iniquity do flouri&s;h; it is that they &s;hall be de&s;troyed forever. But it is good for me to draw near to Thee; and I have put my Tru&s;t in Thee, that I may declare thy wondrous Works,</HI> and own thy Ways un&s;earchable.</P>
<P>And &s;ometimes, <HI>by oblique Ways, and &s;eemingly con|trary Foot&s;teps of Divine Providence, GOD proceeds to accompli&s;h his Purpo&s;es, and his Goings cannot with ea&s;e be traced. Jo&s;eph,</HI> you are &s;en&s;ible, who was envied and hated of his Brethren, was Divinely adverti&s;ed, that he &s;hould be rai&s;ed and advanced to great and high Dig|nity: And yet by what &s;trange Means, and in what un|likely Ways, was it accompli&s;hed! He was &s;old for a Slave and carried into <HI>AEgypt: There,</HI> by rea&s;on of fal&s;e Accu&s;ation, he was unrighteou&s;ly ca&s;t into Pri&s;on and bound in Irons. And how improbable was it now, that
<PB N="10" REF="006716_0011_1029AD89424807B8">
he &s;hould be relea&s;ed; and how much more unlikely, that he &s;hould become a great Man, and be advanced in Dignity and Power, even next to the &s;uperb Monarch of <HI>AEgypt?</HI> And yet GOD in His governing Providence promoted his Advancement by the very improbable Ways and Means preceeding it, and made all the &s;eemingly in|&s;uperable Hindrances and Ob&s;tacles to it effectually to fur|ther and complete his admirable De&s;igns and Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>And <HI>in the like wonderful Ways</HI> does it &s;ometimes come to pa&s;s, that <HI>the Projections and Attempts of the great Adver&s;ary and his In&s;truments to ruin the Churches and People of the Son of GOD are baffled and turned into Fooli&s;hne&s;s.</HI> So when it was the real Intention and vehe|ment Endeavor of the <HI>Pagan Roman Emperors,</HI> by re|peted, long continued and horrible Per&s;ecutions to root Chri&s;tianity out of the World, it was all to no Purpo&s;e. No! What then was the I&s;&s;ue of their cruel De&s;ign and their bloodily earne&s;t Endeavors? See, Sirs, and admire the my&s;terious and wonderful <HI>Ways of GOD!</HI> An ancient Writer ju&s;tly remark'd with regard to this Affair <HI>Quoties metimur, plures efficimur; The more we are mowed,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Tertullian, the more we are encrea&s;ed.</HI>&mdash;And it cannot have e&s;caped our Notice, that, the more the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> have attempted to root out the Prote&s;tant Religion, it has the more commonly and pow|erfully prevail'd; and that maugre all the deceitful Mea|&s;ures projected and all the Methods of Violence and Cruelty u&s;ed by them.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides; <HI>By &s;uch Ways and Means as Mankind would apprehend not to be &s;o proper, nor &s;o adapted to an&s;wer the Ends propo&s;ed, does it plea&s;e the LORD of all &s;ome|times to produce great Effects in the World.</HI> Who could have imagined, that <HI>Naaman</HI> the Syrian would have been re&s;tored to perfect Health by a Method &s;o ea&s;y and gentle? Yet He was thorowly and mo&s;t wondrou&s;ly recovered by it. And who could have hoped, that the Walls of <HI>Jericho</HI> &s;hould totter and fall into &s;preading Ruins in &s;uch a Way and by &s;uch Means as were u&s;ed for it?</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="006716_0012_1029AD9007CD8730">
Nor yet is This all; But <HI>it &s;ometimes plea&s;es GOD to produce great and marvellous Effects by &s;uch Means as Men judge not only to be unlikely, but even to be fooli&s;h and contemptible.</HI> Thus, without mentioning any other Example of it; it de&s;erves to be remarked, that many Thou&s;ands and even Millions of People have been con|verted <HI>by the Fooli&s;hne&s;s of Preaching;</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>by the Preaching of a crucified and Ri&s;en</HI> JESUS, which in the Account of the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Greeks</HI> was only Fooli&s;h|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Now how exqui&s;ite and <HI>un&s;earchable</HI> are the&s;e <HI>Divine Ways?</HI> Who can accurately trace them, and who can <HI>find them out unto Perfection?</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>next</HI> Place, Tho' GOD is plea&s;ed to permit moral Evil in the World, yet <HI>He takes Care by Ways which we cannot trace and inve&s;tigate to bring great moral Good out of it.</HI>&mdash;Thus when it plea&s;ed Him, that his Son <HI>&s;hould be put to Grief,</HI> and He &s;uffered that egre|gious and horrible Crime to be perpetrated, the Cruci|fixion of the MESSIAH; it was permitted and came to pa&s;s, that <HI>We might be redeemed from all Iniquity, and purified to Him&s;elf a peculiar People, zealous of good Works.</HI>&mdash;And &s;o, in his governing Providence, He often cau&s;es <HI>the Sins of His People</HI> to be the Occa&s;ion of va&s;t moral Good and &s;piritual Advantage to them. He &s;o di&s;po&s;es and orders Matters, that Occa&s;ions of Falling and Temptations to Sin are pre&s;ented before them: And they, not &s;en&s;ible of their Weakne&s;s and Hazard, and hence not lifting up their Hearts to the GOD of all Grace to guard them again&s;t the enchanting Circum|&s;tances before them, and <HI>to deliver them from the Evil,</HI> are thro' Inadvertence and Surprize caught, as a &s;imple <HI>Bird in the Snare of the Fowler.</HI> Then they are aba&s;h'd and confounded: And they are thus <HI>humbled and proved;</HI> and for the future they grow more prayerful, circum|&s;pect, vigilant and holy in all Manner of Conver&s;ation.&mdash;So wondrous are the Divine Ways in this Affair as not to be traced by us.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="006716_0013_1029AD9351FC4B38">
But we proceed to ob&s;erve, in the <HI>Third</HI> and la&s;t Place, <HI>Un&s;earchable are tho&s;e Ways of GOD, and not to be found out, which &s;eem not to agree with His Word. By the&s;e Ways of GOD,</HI> we mean &s;uch <HI>Pa&s;&s;ages of Divine Pro|vidence, as &s;eem to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the Divine Promi&s;es and Threatnings.</HI></P>
<P>There is frequently &s;uch a State of Things to be found with regard to good and wicked People in the World, that it is not &s;o very ea&s;y&punc; from the Word of GOD to account for it.&mdash;Is not <HI>Good promi&s;ed to the Pious,</HI> and is not <HI>penal Evil threatned again&s;t the Wicked?</HI> How then comes it to pa&s;s, that <HI>the Wicked</HI> are often and long in ea&s;y and comfortable Circum&s;tances; while <HI>the Good</HI> are frequently afflicted and exerci&s;ed with great and long continued Sorrows?</P>
<P>The&s;e Things, tho' they be not really repugnant, are yet &s;eemingly incon&s;i&s;tent and contradictory. And hence very wi&s;e, as well as very good, Men have been puzled and perplexed with the&s;e <HI>Divine Ways,</HI> and utterly at a Lo&s;s how to trace and how to account for Them. So it was with the pious <HI>A&s;aph,</HI> who declares him&s;elf to be at a Lo&s;s about the Divine Conduct in the&s;e In&s;tances, as in P&s;alm lxxiii. 16. <HI>When I tho't to know</HI> This, <HI>it was too painful for me;</HI> or rather, accord|ing to the emphatical Hebrew Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>it was Labor to mine Eyes</HI> h. e. It greatly fatigued my Mind to look and &s;earch into it. And the weeping Prophet, while He allows <HI>the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the&s;e Divine Ways,</HI> yet begs leave to <HI>Rea&s;on with his GOD concerning His Judg|ments,</HI> h. e. His holy Purpo&s;es and the Execution of them. And then He proceeds wondring and enquiring, as in Jerem. xii. 1. <HI>Wherefore doth the Way of the Wicked pro&s;per,</HI> &amp;c?&mdash;And another holy Prophet, while He acknowleges the Divine Purity and moral Rectitude, yet at the &s;ame Time admires at the Divine Conduct in the In&s;tance before us and enquires as want|ing to be re&s;olved about it; &s;aying as in Habak. i. 13. <HI>Thou art of purer Eyes than to behold Evil, and
<PB N="13" REF="006716_0014_1029AD94D5B54FE0">
can&s;t not look upon Iniquity:</HI> Wherefore <HI>looke&s;t Thou upon them that deal treacherou&s;ly, and bolde&s;t thy Peace, when the Wicked devoureth the Man that is more righteous than he?</HI></P>
<P>But, now for preventing any Confu&s;ion of Senti|ments, We mu&s;t be a little more di&s;tinct and particular.</P>
<P>On one Hand then, It is ob&s;ervable, that <HI>the Ways of GOD &s;ometimes do not appear to be according to His Threatnings:</HI> And in this Regard His Dealings are not ea&s;ily to be traced. It is Divinely threatned, that <HI>it &s;hall go ill with the Wicked, for the Reward of his Hands &s;hall be given him:</HI> It is the Divine Threat|ning, that <HI>there &s;hall be many Sorrows to the Wick|ed;</HI> and concerning tho&s;e, who are <HI>Wicked over much&punc;</HI> it is &s;aid, that <HI>they &s;hall die before their Time.</HI> And yet is it not frequently otherwi&s;e? Have not <HI>the Wicked</HI> often many Advantages and Comforts, and that too &s;ometimes in a con&s;tant Series and long Suc|ce&s;&s;ion of them? It is a plain Ca&s;e. The Wicked often <HI>are not in Trouble as other Men, neither are they plagued as others,</HI> who are good and upright: <HI>Their Eyes &s;tand out with Fatne&s;s: They have more than Heart could wi&s;h.</HI> Yea, &s;uch and &s;o un&s;earchable are the Divine Ways, the Wicked &s;ometimes <HI>live and become old, and grow mighty in Power.</HI></P>
<P>But then, on the other Hand, <HI>The Divine Ways &s;eem &s;ometimes to be incon&s;i&s;tent</HI> with the Divine Pro|mi&s;es and even contrary to them. There was a re|markable In&s;tance of this Truth in <HI>the Divine Ways</HI> particularly with regard to the Family of <HI>David&punc;</HI> Which Ways were &s;o my&s;terious and perplexing, that they were not to be traced. For it was promi&s;ed to <HI>David,</HI> and we have the Promi&s;e recorded in P&s;alm. lxxxix. 36 and 37. <HI>His Seed &s;hall endure forever, and his Throne as the Sun: It &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed forever as the Moon before me,</HI> &amp;c: And yet we find in the 38^t^h&punc; and &s;ome following Ver&s;es of the very &s;ame P&s;alm tho&s;e &s;orrowful Complaints and melancholy
<PB N="14" REF="006716_0015_1029AD9809465808">
Moans, <HI>But Thou has ca&s;t off and abhorred: Thou ha&s;t been wroth with thine Anointed: Thou ha&s;t made void the Covenant of thy Servant: Thou ha&s;t profaned his Crown by ca&s;ting it to the Ground. All that pa&s;s by the Way &s;poil him: He is a Reproach to his Neighbours: Thou ha&s;t covered him with Shame,</HI> &amp;c. How dark were the&s;e Ways, and how puz|ling the&s;e Dealings of the Great GOD! That the Family of <HI>David,</HI> to which &s;uch &s;ignal and glorious Things were promi&s;ed, &s;hould be for a Deri&s;ion and Scorn among the Pagans.

And where is now your everla&s;ting Family; from which ONE is to de&s;cend, who is to rule ever all and reign forever?</HI> Verily at that Time Things look'd very di&s;couraging, nor was there any finding out of the Divine Ways.</P>
<P>But there is, as you are all &s;en&s;ible, a more general Promi&s;e made to the Pious, that <HI>it &s;hall be well with</HI> them. And yet, &s;uch is the Conduct of Divine Provi|dence, it is the Portion of many good Men to &s;ee evil Days: <HI>Yea few and evil are often the Days of their Pil|grimage</HI> here below. And indeed it is no rare and un|u&s;ual Thing for them to be <HI>per&s;ecuted for the very &s;ake of their Vertue and Righteou&s;ne&s;s: This</HI> it is, which cau&s;es the Children of Craft and Cruelty to deprive them of their worldly Intere&s;t by Fraud and Violence: And hence they are con&s;train'd to live in abject Poverty and piteous Wretchedne&s;s; whereas it might have been quite <HI>other|wi&s;e</HI> with them, if they could licentiou&s;ly tre&s;pa&s;s on the Laws of Truth and Vertue!

<P><PB N="15" REF="006716_0016_1029AD9B52D574F8">
And, be&s;ides &s;uch general Engagements, there are <HI>&s;ome particular ones</HI> with regard to the Children of Ver|tue and holy Obedience. Thus there is an apparent <HI>Promi&s;e of long Life to &s;uch as are dutiful Children:</HI> And it mu&s;t be allowed, that in many In&s;tances it has been accompli&s;hed. But yet have there not been valuable and very pious Children, &s;o dutiful to their Parents as that for the whole World they would not in Action or by a Word offend them, who neverthele&s;s <HI>have not been &s;uf|fered to continue with them by Rea&s;on of Death?</HI></P>
<P>And there is al&s;o <HI>the Promi&s;e of the Life that now is,</HI> or of worldly and temporal Ble&s;&s;ings, <HI>to Piety, and &s;uch as exerci&s;e them&s;elves unto it.</HI> And yet how many have &s;uffered as to their worldly Affairs and Intere&s;ts for this very Rea&s;on, becau&s;e they have &s;tedfa&s;tly cho&s;en, and would re&s;olutely practi&s;e the Things which are plea&s;ing to GOD?</P>
<P>But &s;ome, as we are aware, will be ready to &s;tart and &s;ay, <HI>How can the&s;e Things be, and how can they be re|conciled?</HI> The glorious GOD, who is <HI>the GOD of Truth and without Iniquity, cannot lie:</HI> And hence <HI>all the Pro|mi&s;es,</HI> as well as <HI>Threatnings,</HI> of his Word mu&s;t be &s;ure and faithful. But <HI>how then comes it to pa&s;s, that the Wicked pro&s;per?</HI> And, when it is engaged to the Pious, that <HI>it &s;hall be well with them, and temporal Ble&s;&s;ings &s;hall be conferred on them;</HI> neverthele&s;s <HI>they have worldly En|joyments witheld from them,</HI> and have <HI>many Afflictions and much Tribulation</HI> in the World?</P>
<P>It is u&s;ually &s;aid in an&s;wer to &s;uch Enquiries, that, as <HI>the Threatnings of GOD &s;hall &s;ooner or later take Place;</HI> &s;o <HI>&s;hall the Divine Promi&s;es.</HI> For <HI>The&s;e</HI> are not to be taken <HI>ab&s;olutely;</HI> but they are to be under&s;tood in this re&s;trained Sen&s;e, <HI>&s;o far as &s;hall be mo&s;t for the Divine Glory and the Good of the Pious.</HI> All indeed mu&s;t allow, that, as the <HI>Divine Wi&s;dom is infinite; GOD knows what is be&s;t</HI> upon the whole; and in particular whether worldly Pro&s;perity is be&s;t for His faithful Servants&mdash;It may indeed be <HI>good and very de&s;ireable in it&s;elf,</HI> and it may be of no

&s;mall <HI>Advantage with regard to others.</HI> And yet it may not be convenient, nor yet &s;afe, for good People: For it is po&s;&s;ible, nor at all unlikely, that, if they had a large and affluent Supply of worldly Comforts, they might <HI>be forgetful of GOD,</HI> as well as of them&s;elves; and &s;o give the Reins to criminal Appetites and Inclinations, and hurry on their own Ruin. And as GOD perfectly knows whether outward Pro&s;perity would be thus dangerous and hurtful to them; &s;o we cannot &s;ay, that, &s;uppo&s;ing This would be the Ca&s;e, GOD has promi&s;ed to give it unto them.&mdash;And be&s;ides, it is probable, that <HI>an adver&s;e State of Things may be very good</HI> for them: For they may, by Means thereof, be con&s;iderably advanced in Wi&s;dom and Vertue; and &s;o <HI>GOD may be more glorifi|ed</HI> by them in this World, and They may <HI>gain a higher Degree of Glory</HI> in the happy Apartments of the invi&s;ible World. And hence an afflicted and &s;orrowful Condition in Life may be really better for them than a State of out|ward Pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>But, with regard both to <HI>the Promi&s;es and Threatnings</HI> of the Eternal GOD, there is one Thing to be con&s;idered, which greatly &s;erves to remove Objections and &s;olve Difficulties as to the Article before us: Which is, that both <HI>the Promi&s;es and Threatnings of GOD &s;hall receive their plenary and perfect Accompli&s;hment</HI> in the future State.</P>
<P>As then to the <HI>Threatnings</HI> of the Divine Word again&s;t tho&s;e, who go on impenitently and &s;ecurely in their Sins, <HI>The&s;e</HI> &s;hall &s;urely, punctually and fully come upon them in the future State.&mdash;The well-meaning, but ill-judging, Friends of the upright and inflexibly good <HI>Job</HI> in&s;i&s;ted indeed on it, that <HI>&s;ignal Calamity mu&s;t come on the Wicked even in this World:</HI> And it mu&s;t be granted, that &s;o it &s;ometimes comes to pa&s;s.&mdash;But yet it is frequently other|wi&s;e: They are often pre&s;erved from de&s;erved Plagues and Mi&s;eries: Tho' they are &s;ometimes kept from le&s;&s;er Judgments, that they may be overwhelm'd with greater in the pre&s;ent World. But, in the future State, they
<PB N="17" REF="006716_0018_1029ADA252CB89E8">
&s;hall have all tho&s;e Plagues and Mi&s;eries, which are threatned again&s;t the wicked and impenitent, inflicted on them; and, as it is expre&s;&s;ed in the prophetical and figu|rative Stile, <HI>The Smoke of their Torment &s;hall a&s;cend for|ever and ever.</HI></P>
<P>And then, As to <HI>the Promi&s;es</HI> of the Faithful GOD, that <HI>the Righteous &s;hall flouri&s;h and &s;ee Good,</HI> that <HI>their Days &s;hall be prolonged,</HI> and they <HI>&s;hall rejoice and be glad always;</HI> if He &s;ee it to be fitte&s;t and be&s;t for them, that the&s;e Promi&s;es &s;hould be accompli&s;hed unto them in this World, He will doubtle&s;s take Care in His governing Providence that They &s;hall be &s;o. But, if, for the mo&s;t wi&s;e and gracious Purpo&s;es and Ends, He &s;ees cau&s;e not to fulfil the&s;e Engagements in this World; yet He will certainly and to the full, He will completely and forever make them good in the heavenly World. <HI>There</HI> they &s;hall enjoy many Days, and &s;ee good and rejoice in them all: <HI>There</HI> they &s;hall <HI>not lack any good Thing,</HI> but <HI>have all their Wants &s;upplied,</HI> and all their De&s;ires &s;atisfied: And <HI>there</HI> their Joy always &s;hall be overflowing, and yet ever full: <HI>In thy Pre&s;ence,</HI> O Incarnate GOD, <HI>is this Fulne&s;s of Joy, and at thy Right Hand are the&s;e Plea|&s;ures forevermore.</HI></P>
<P>We have thus been in&s;tancing in &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages of Di|vine Providence, which &s;eem to be incon&s;i&s;tent, with the Word of GOD, and to run counter to it: Which <HI>Ways of GOD</HI> are indeed very difficult to be traced. We have indeed offered a few Sentiments, which may &s;erve in &s;ome Mea&s;ure to clear and vindicate the Divine Conduct. But yet, after all, <HI>O Thou Fir&s;t, Thou Greate&s;t and Be&s;t of Beings, who art the &s;upreme Moderator of all Things, and our Lord and Father, we mu&s;t confe&s;s, that, after all we have heard, it is but a &s;mall Portion of thy Conduct which falls within our View: And, as Thy Judgments are un&s;earchable to us, &s;o Thy Ways are pa&s;t finding out by us.</HI></P>
<P>But, having thus endeavored <HI>to &s;et before you &s;ome of tho&s;e Ways of GOD which are not to be traced and inve&s;ti|gated

by us;</HI> our <HI>next</HI> Attempt mu&s;t be to &s;hew, that <HI>the Knowlege and Wi&s;dom of GOD</HI> in the&s;e His Divine Ways <HI>is not to be traced and inve&s;tigated by us.</HI></P>
<P>And now,</P>
<P>This mu&s;t appear evident to us <HI>from the Nature and Rea&s;on of the Thing:</HI> For <HI>the Knowlege and Wi&s;dom of GOD is infinite and eternal</HI> And it therefore becomes us devoutly to acknowlege and adore before Him. <HI>Great is our LORD, and of great Power: His Under&s;tanding is</HI> infinite; and it is everla&s;ting.

<P>And, as <HI>the Wi&s;dom and Knowlege of GOD is infinite;</HI> on the other Side, <HI>The Knowlege and Wi&s;dom of Creatures,</HI> and that of even the mo&s;t knowing and wi&s;e, <HI>is but li|mited and finite.</HI> And con&s;equently the mo&s;t wi&s;e and knowing of them can only perceive and apprehend <HI>the finite and limited Effects</HI> of Divine and Infinite Knowlege.

There is a good Pa&s;&s;age to this Purpo&s;e of one of the greate&s;t Divines, that has lived &s;ince the Days of In&s;piration, with regard to the Divine Coun&s;els and the Divine Manner of influencing moral Agents, which we may do well to entertain and keep in our Minds for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing their Vanity as to the&s;e Mat|ters; <HI>If,</HI> &s;ays he, in his <HI>Catholic Theology, any particular Manner thereof offer it&s;elf to your Minds, as that which probably &s;eems to be the Right; it may afford you Rea&s;on</HI> therefore <HI>to &s;u&s;pect, that</HI> it is not the Right; <HI>Becau&s;e it is certain the Manner is beyond our Reach: And what Man can comprehend is infinitely below GOD.</HI></P>
<P>However in the next Place, <HI>let us not</HI> hence conclude, <HI>that, &s;ince the Ways,</HI> as well as <HI>Coun&s;els of GOD, are pa&s;t finding out,</HI> therefore <HI>we may be carele&s;s or negligent about making any Enquiry concerning the Divine Conduct and the Works of Divine Providence.</HI> There are indeed <HI>&s;ome</HI> of the Divine Ways which e&s;cape our View and exceed our Comprehen&s;ion: But then there are <HI>others,</HI> which can more ea&s;ily be traced and better under&s;tood. Thus it is particularly as to tho&s;e <HI>grievous</HI> Calamities, with which GOD is plea&s;ed &s;ometimes to vi&s;it a faithle&s;s and rebel|lious People: For <HI>he, that runs, may read</HI> Part of the Divine Intent and Meaning in them, and perceive in &s;ome good Mea&s;ure <HI>wherefore God contendeth with them:</HI> 'Tis this, as Divine In&s;piration has given it unto us, in P&s;alm xxviii. 5, Becau&s;e <HI>they regard not the Works of the LORD, nor the Operations of His Hands, the LORD will not build them up, but de&s;troy them.</HI></P>
<P>And,</P>
<P>In the Third Place, As it appears, that the <HI>Coun&s;els of GOD are un&s;earchable and his Ways pa&s;t finding out;</HI> let us hence <HI>have a Care of mi&s;interpreting the Divine Methods and Ways,</HI> and &s;o <HI>making a wrong U&s;e and Im|provement

of them.</HI> The Divine Maje&s;ty, who rules and who <HI>doeth what&s;oever He plea&s;es among the Inhabitants of this World,</HI> as well as governs in the Armies of Hea|ven above, may &s;eem &s;ometimes <HI>to frown upon his People, and to &s;mile on their Enemies.</HI> But what then? Shall we hence imagine, that GOD approves of wicked Men, and is regardle&s;s of the People whom He loves? No&punc; This would be a wrong Con&s;truction and Sen&s;e of the Matter: And it would be very irregular and &s;inful to act from &s;uch an Apprehen&s;ion. And, in order to guard us again&s;t any &s;uch Mi&s;apprehen&s;ion and bad Conduct, let us attend to what the Divine Being has reveled by one of His Prophets, in Mal. iii. from the 14th V. <HI>Ye have &s;aid, It is vain to &s;erve GOD: And what Profit is it that we kept his Ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of Ho&s;ts? And now we call the Proud hap|py: yea they that work Wickedne&s;s are &s;et up, yea they that tempt GOD are even delivered. Then they, that feared the LORD, &s;pake often one to another; and the LORD hearkned and heard, and a Book of Remembrance was written before Him for them that feared the LORD and that tho't upon his Name: And they &s;hall be mine, &s;aith the LORD of Ho&s;ts, in that Day when I make up my Jewels; and I will &s;pare them, as a Man &s;pareth his own Son that &s;erveth him:</HI> Then <HI>&s;hall ye return and di&s;cern between the Righteous and the Wicked; between him that &s;erveth GOD, and him that &s;erveth Him not.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, and in the <HI>la&s;t</HI> Place, <HI>Let us all,</HI> upon the whole, <HI>prepare and ripen, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Divine Grace, for the happy Time, wherein we may enjoy more clear and full Di&s;coveries of the Divine Coun&s;els, and the dark and my&s;terious Ways of Divine Providence.</HI></P>
<P>We live in a World, wherein gloomy and perplexing Events do ever and anon occur: And &s;uch are &s;ome|times <HI>the Ways</HI> of Divine Providence, &s;o dark and very intricate are they, that <HI>in vain do our Under&s;tandings try to trace them,</HI> and find out the particular Intent and preci&s;e Meaning of them.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="006716_0025_1029ADB7CE0BF668">
And now,</P>
<P><HI>My Honorable, Reverend and Beloved Hearers,</HI></P>
<P>I am very well per&s;uaded, that you con&s;ider the Death of the High, Pui&s;&s;ant and mo&s;t Illu&s;trious Prince, FREDERICK LEWIS, Elder Son of our mo&s;t gra|cious Sovereign King <HI>GEORGE</HI> the Second, Prince of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> Electoral-Prince of <HI>Brun&s;wick-Lunen|burgh,</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales, &amp;c.</HI> as a very dark&s;ome Event, and <HI>one of the</HI> my&s;terious <HI>Ways of GOD which is not to be inve&s;tigated</HI> by us.</P>
<P>'Twas on the <HI>Night of Gloomine&s;s, Clouds and thick Darkne&s;s</HI> preceeding the Twenty-fir&s;t of <HI>March,</HI> between eleven and twelve o'Clock, that He departed this Life, to the utmo&s;t Grief of His Royal Parent, His Illu&s;tri|ous Con&s;ort, and the whole Royal Family; and to the inexpre&s;&s;ible Sorrow, as well as un&s;peakable Lo&s;s, of the Public; who had conceived highly concerning Him, who expected good and great Things from &s;uch a wi&s;e and merciful Prince, and were ready to &s;ay, <HI>This &s;ame &s;hall</HI> hereafter more con&s;iderably and exten&s;ively <HI>comfort us.</HI></P>
<P>But ah! How are our fond Hopes withered! How are our plea&s;ing Views and Expectations at an End! For the <HI>lovely Prince,</HI> as well as the rough Pea&s;ant, dies and returns to the Du&s;t.&mdash;Thus, <HI>LORD GOD, ha&s;t Thou turned our promi&s;ing Hope and Joy into Di&s;appointment and Mourning: Thou hast deprived us of Gladne&s;s, and girded us with Sackcloth: Thou do&s;t hide thy Face from us; and we are troubled.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot be rea&s;onably expected, that we, on this Side of the wide <HI>Atlantic,</HI> &s;hould be able, from a thorow Knowlege of the dear PRINCE, to give Him his entire and ju&s;t Character: And hence we &s;hall not be &s;o a&s;piring as to undertake it.</P>
<P>But however, &s;ince there are &s;undry Particulars rela|ting to Him which have reached us; and as it is fit and right, that The&s;e &s;hould be rehear&s;ed; and that not only
<PB N="25" REF="006716_0026_1029ADBB19AF8FC0">
out of Re&s;pect unto Him, but from a Religious Regard to <HI>the Prince of the Kings of the Earth,</HI> that &s;o the Glory of His Gifts and Benefits may redound unto Him; therefore we cannot well be excu&s;ed from piou&s;ly de|claring the&s;e Things.</P>
<P>As the be&s;t Care was taken with regard to his High|ne&s;s's Education; &s;o his Improvements in Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s were an&s;werable to it: For He &s;oon di&s;covered, that <HI>He carried a Mind within Him</HI> beyond his Years, <HI>and manly Tho'ts and Concerns</HI> in the Bloom of Youth: And, as apprehending Him&s;elf <HI>born for greater Things</HI> than tho&s;e, about which young People generally employ them&s;elves, He behaved Him&s;elf accordingly. And, <HI>on the&s;e Accounts,</HI> He &s;oon became no le&s;s dear to his Royal Parents, than on the Account of his De&s;cent from Them.</P>
<P>It was no Di&s;advantage to the PRINCE, that He was of a &s;weet and engaging A&s;pect, and a very agreeable Air and Deportment; For, by means of The&s;e external Cir|cum&s;tances, He at once drew and allured the Affection of all, who had any Sen&s;e of what is amiable and be|coming.</P>
<P>But it was much more to his real Character and Credit and Glory, that he was of a humane, benevolent and kind Temper of Mind: And hence He was ea&s;y of Acce&s;s, courteous of Speech and conde&s;cending in Behaviour: For, altho' He were next in Dignity to his mo&s;t excellent Maje&s;ty, the KING, Yet He con&s;idered Him&s;elf <HI>as a Man and a Subject,</HI> in common with the Re&s;t of his Fel|low Subjects beneath Him: And hence He conver&s;ed and acted in the Palace and abroad with continual Man|&s;uetude, Humility and Gentlene&s;s.</P>
<P>As He very well knew, that <HI>Political Knowledge and Wi&s;dom</HI> was requi&s;ite to qualify one for the Government of others; therefore he was careful and indu&s;trious to acquire this Knowledge and Wi&s;dom, both from the mo&s;t able Preceptors and from approved Authors: Tho' at the &s;ame Time other Branches of Science were not neglected by Him.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="006716_0027_1029ADC3F940A978">
Behold Him at length commencing Man; and, thro' the tender Care of our gracious Sovereign, happily mar|ried to a Prince&s;s of matchle&s;s Form, of &s;urpa&s;&s;ing Ac|compli&s;hments, a &s;hining Pattern of Vertue and of in|comparable Merit in the E&s;teem of all around her. And now how careful was he to perform the Offices of the wedded State, and <HI>&s;et a bright Example of connubial Fi|delity and Tenderne&s;s, in the mid&s;t of an adulterous and profligate Generation.</HI> And it &s;urely demon&s;trates a pro|digious Degeneracy of Manners and a &s;hamele&s;s Effron|tery in Vice, that &s;o many would &s;till licentiou&s;ly break the Nuptial Bond; while they had the Example of the PRINCE, as well as the <HI>Laws and Threatnings of the im|mortal GOD,</HI> again&s;t them.</P>
<P>The worthy PRINCE, <HI>as not born for Him&s;elf but Others,</HI> was &s;tudious to behave aright and well towards them. Hence He was devoted to his Royal Parent and the public Good: And as He wore the Motto on his Arms as Prince of <HI>Wales, Ich Dien,</HI> or <HI>I &s;erve;</HI> &s;o <HI>He fulfilled it:</HI> For He tho't it <HI>his Honor to &s;erve</HI> the be&s;t of Kings, as well as of Parents; and, while He was <HI>the Delight of all Mankind,</HI> He was <HI>willing to &s;erve and help</HI> them all.</P>
<P>He gave the World &s;ome Specimens and Proofs of his Di&s;po&s;ition to promote the Trade and Commerce of his Royal Parent's Kingdoms, and to encourage Learning and u&s;eful Arts in them: And it was doubtle&s;s plea&s;ing to His Maje&s;ty's good Subjects at Home, as it has been to us in the&s;e di&s;tant Lands, that He, on the&s;e Accounts, received &s;uch fit Acknowlegements and public Te&s;timo|nies of Re&s;pect and Gratitude. Be&s;ides his being the fir&s;t Commi&s;&s;ioner for building the Royal Ho&s;pital at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> and Governor of the <HI>Briti&s;h white Herring Fi&s;hery;</HI> He was cho&s;en the Chancellor of the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Dublin,</HI> and a Fellow of the Royal Society in <HI>London,</HI> and received other Te&s;timonies be&s;ides of national E&s;teem.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be mentioned to his Renown, that He in an exemplary Way <HI>attended on the public Offices of Religion:
<PB N="27" REF="006716_0028_1029ADC58A060A40">
Nor was He a&s;hamed,</HI> as too many of the great Ones of the Earth &s;eem to be, <HI>to acknowlege his Maker and Lord,</HI> as well as ours, <HI>in private</HI> with his Hou&s;hold.</P>
<P>And be&s;ides, He was <HI>a Prince in Goodne&s;s and Benig|nity,</HI> and exhibited a high and mighty <HI>Pattern of Chri&s;|tian Love and good Works.</HI> Among the Proofs and Evi|dences of This, <HI>New-England</HI> has &s;ome to produce and utter with &s;ingular Delight and Satisfaction. <HI>His Royal Highne&s;s</HI> was plea&s;ed to &s;end a very hand&s;ome Gratuity towards the School for the Education of Indian Children at <HI>Hou&s;itonock</HI> under the Care of the late pious and learn|ed Mr. <HI>Sergeant.</HI> And, as we under&s;tand, it was the expre&s;&s;ed De&s;ign and Purpo&s;e of the PRINCE to grant to the Succe&s;&s;or of the &s;ame reverend and very valuable Mi&s;&s;ionary, if properly recommended, a very hand&s;ome Annuity as long as He lived. So that the Goodne&s;s and Charity of his Royal Highne&s;s, like the plea&s;ing Light of the <HI>Morning-Star,</HI> was not confined to <HI>the other He|mi&s;phere,</HI> but &s;hone over the va&s;t Ocean, and reached to the di&s;tant Wilds of the&s;e <HI>American</HI> Regions.</P>
<P>His Royal Highne&s;s, the PRINCE, thorowly under|&s;tood, that, altho' Government was of Divine In&s;titution, yet the Form of it is an humane Ordinance: He knew, that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Monarchy was not ab&s;olute and indefeazable, but <HI>elective and hereditarily &s;o:</HI> He &s;aw clearly, that no|thing was <HI>lawful</HI> in the Admini&s;tration but what was <HI>allowed by the Laws</HI> of the Realm; and that He, who wears the Crown by the National Con&s;ent and Choice, is not above the Laws, nor at Liberty to di&s;pen&s;e with them.&mdash;Nor have we any Doubt, but that his Royal Highne&s;s was confirmed in the&s;e Sentiments and Views from the Admini&s;tration of His mo&s;t Excellent Father and Grandfather, and &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed in his Purpo&s;es by the Will of GOD to rule and govern according to them.</P>
<P>Thus was his Royal Highne&s;s <HI>prepared to be the Fa|ther of his People,</HI> before He was really &s;o: And, by all that we can collect, He was inflexibly determined to do nothing that might prove detrimental to the Intere&s;ts
<PB N="28" REF="006716_0029_1029ADC70D2138A8">
of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and it's Dependencies; nor to neglect any Thing, which might promote, &s;ecure and protract the Welfare and Happine&s;s of the People to be <HI>his future Charge. His future Charge,</HI> did I &s;ay? Alas! He mu&s;t be <HI>ju&s;t fitted and qualified</HI> to receive them <HI>as &s;uch;</HI> and yet, <HI>&s;o un&s;earchable is the Divine Conduct.</HI> He mu&s;t be <HI>removed from them,</HI> nor inherit their delightful Ho|mage and Subjection.</P>
<P><HI>The&s;e</HI> are a few, of the many valuable Things, relating to His Royal Highne&s;s; which endeared Him unto us while living; and which, at his Decea&s;e, cau&s;e a general Concern and Grief, and the &s;uitable Expre&s;&s;ions of it a|mong us.</P>
<P>We are now therefore dutifully following our gra|cious Sovereign and Father, the KING, and our Mother Kingdoms, tho' <HI>with more late and unequal Steps,</HI> in paying our mournful Re&s;pects on the Account of the PRINCE's Exit.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty's good and mo&s;t dutiful Subjects of this Province, who enjoy the Benefit of the Civil E&s;tabli&s;h|ment in Favor of our Religious Rights and Privileges; and who are as a People, if we under&s;tand our own Prin|ciples, the mo&s;t thorow A&s;&s;erters of the ju&s;t Liberties of Mankind, are <HI>to a Man inviolably attached to His Ma|je&s;ty King</HI> GEORGE, <HI>and the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion in his Royal Hou&s;e: To a Man</HI> therefore we unite in deploring the Lo&s;s of his Royal Son: And it is our united Wi&s;h and mo&s;t fervent Prayer, that His Maje&s;ty may be &s;up|ported under this grievous Bereavement; that He may gain &s;piritual Good by it, and that, by the Lo&s;s of his own de&s;ireable Son, He may be further <HI>influenced and animated to e&s;pou&s;e the Cau&s;e of the Son of GOD,</HI> and promote His Kingdom and Intere&s;t not only at Home, but in other <HI>European</HI> Nations al&s;o.</P>
<P>We have al&s;o a mo&s;t tender Sympathy with Thee, Il|lu&s;trious Prince&s;s AUGUSTA, who ha&s;t lo&s;t thy well be|loved
<PB N="29" REF="006716_0030_1029ADC8903640D8">
and excellent Prince; and who, as long as Thou did&s;t enjoy Him, did&s;t exhibit a great and engaging Pat|tern of conjugal Affection and Obedience. <HI>The LORD GOD Almighty &s;trengthen Thee, and uphold Thee by the Right Hand of his Righteou&s;ne&s;s! The Prince of Life be with thee, thy con&s;tant Guide and kind Supporter! May He never for&s;ake, and never fail Thee!</HI></P>
<P>At the &s;ame Time we condole with his Royal High|ne&s;s the DUKE, with the Prince&s;&s;es and the Re&s;t of the Royal Family; heartily de&s;iring and entreating, that the GOD of all Grace and Comfort would afford unto them <HI>Spiritual Supplies and Con&s;olations,</HI> which are indeed <HI>no &s;mall Things;</HI> but un&s;peakably greater and more glorious than all the Delights and Grandeurs which this World can afford them.</P>
<P>Our Hearts too are properly affected in thinking of <HI>the Po&s;terity of his Royal Highne&s;s:</HI> And we are much grieved for them, that They are &s;o early and &s;oon depri|ved of their meritorious Parent; and &s;o They may not be allowed any longer to be in&s;tructed by his Coun&s;els, and charmed and led along by his Example. We ble&s;s however the Divine Arbiter and Sovereign LORD of the World, that He has not left <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and its De|pendencies to <HI>bewail a broken Lineage and a doubtful Throne:</HI> For his Royal Highne&s;s has left <HI>five Sons and three Daughters</HI> as Pledges of Peace and Comfort unto us. And it is now our humble and earne&s;t Prayer, that his Royal Highne&s;s Prince GEORGE, <HI>&s;weet Youth,</HI> our FREDERICK now, who &s;uceeds his Father as Heir ap|parent to the Imperial Crown of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and that his Royal Highne&s;s's Brethren and Si&s;ters al&s;o may be the Special Care and Charge of Divine Providence, that they may be pre&s;erved for eminent Ble&s;&s;ings, and that the Su|perior Wi&s;dom and heroic Vertues of their long and glorious Train of Ance&s;tors, from his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, whom GOD pre&s;erve, even back to the Times of the Reformation, may be inherited and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by them.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="006716_0031_1029ADCA162F3300">
We have thus been di&s;charging our Duty to a mo&s;t valuable and excellent Prince: Griev'd am I, and a&s;hamed, that my Part has been perform'd no better; yet hoping, that an hone&s;t De&s;ign and Endeavour to do well will not be contemned by tho&s;e of greater Abilities.</P>
<P>But, &s;ince it appears, that a mo&s;t &s;orrowful Event has befallen us; the Que&s;tion is, <HI>What is the Improvement that we are to make of it?</HI> What are we to do for the Support of our Minds under it, and to keep them from &s;inking under the Pre&s;&s;ure of &s;uch a heavy Bereavement, as well as all other grievous Di&s;pen&s;ations.</P>
<P><HI>Hear now</HI> then <HI>the Conclu&s;ion of the whole Matter.</HI> Let us all both Rulers and Subjects, both high and low, both rich and poor together, by the Aids and A&s;&s;i&s;tances of Divine Grace mo&s;t heartily implored and thankfully im|proved, <HI>not put our Tru&s;t in Princes, nor any of the Sons of Men, in whom there is no help: For their Breath goeth forth: They return to the Earth, and in that very Day all their Tho'ts</HI> concerning us <HI>peri&s;h.</HI> But let us <HI>put our Tru&s;t in the almighty Power and infinite Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s of GOD:</HI> For altho' an excellent Prince has left our Earth, <HI>to &s;it,</HI> as we tru&s;t, <HI>with Princes above,</HI> even <HI>with the Princes</HI> of the heavenly Court; and, on the Account of This, as well as <HI>the &s;ad moral State of Things</HI> at Home, and in our Land, our Minds cannot but be clouded and filled with Perplexities and Fears; yet we ought, from a clear Apprehen&s;ion of the infinite Wi&s;dom, Ability and Readine&s;s of GOD to ap|pear for us and protect and ble&s;s us, to <HI>make The&s;e,</HI> as well as His Promi&s;es thro' JESUS CHRIST, <HI>our Hope and Tru&s;t and unfailing Refuge:</HI> And accordingly, let us, from a real Conviction and hearty Sen&s;e of the&s;e Di|vine Perfections and Promi&s;es, <HI>commit the Ca&s;e</HI> of our Nations and this poor Land to the Divine Being, <HI>with Hope in his Mercy,</HI> as well as Dependance on His Power and Wi&s;dom, yet to &s;ave, defend and pro&s;per us; but
<PB N="31" REF="006716_0032_1029ADCD48F15A38">
with an entire and profound Re&s;ignation to His &s;overeign Will.&mdash;And let us all <HI>acquaint our &s;elves with our GOD and be at Peace:</HI> Let us <HI>think on our Ways, and turn our Feet into the Divine Te&s;timonies;</HI> let us <HI>make ha&s;te and make no Delay to turn to GOD thro' the only Mediator, and to glorify Him on the Earth and &s;erve our Generation according to His Will,</HI> as well as to <HI>work out our own Salvation with Fear and Trembling.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Things are e&s;&s;entially fit and right: And They are good and profitable unto Men: And, <HI>if we do the&s;e Things,</HI> and continue con&s;tant and <HI>faithful unto the Death</HI> in them; Then, we &s;hall <HI>have an open and abundant En|trance mini&s;tred to us into the everla&s;ting Kingdom of our great</HI> LORD <HI>and</HI> SAVIOUR: Then, The dark Events of relative Time will be explained to univer&s;al Satisfaction; and <HI>tho&s;e Coun&s;els and Ways of GOD,</HI> which have been inexplicable, nor to be inve&s;tigated by us, <HI>will be unfolded and appear in a Light un&s;peakable and full of Glory:</HI> And, in Fine, Then, Then, All the intelligent happy Creation will with one Con&s;ent render due Acknowlege|ments and Glories to GOD and the Lamb: And may we all, without one of this great A&s;&s;embly mi&s;&s;ing, join the Heavenly Throng, &s;aying, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing and Honor and Glory be to Him that &s;itteth on the Throne, and to the Lamb forever and ever,</HI> AMEN!</P>
