<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>_THE following <HI>SERMONS,</HI> as you will find by &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages in them, were Preach'd not long after the <HI>Terrible Earthquake</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">October 29, 30. 1727.</NOTE>, whereby, the People in <HI>NEW-ENGLAND,</HI> were generally very much <HI>Awakened;</HI> and Multitudes, almo&s;t in every Town and Pari&s;h, came to their Mini&s;ters, as the <HI>Jaylor,</HI> in my Text, did to <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas,</HI> with this important Inquiry, <HI>Sirs, What mu&s;t we do to be Saved?</HI> And 'twas a Joyful Sight to us, to behold &s;uch a gracious Effect of &s;o aw|ful a Di&s;pen&s;ation. For tho', by this means, our Work was greatly increa&s;ed on our Hands; yet I believe, your Pa&s;tors never went more cheerfully thro' their a|bundant Labours, nor took more Pains to
<PB N="ii" REF="003231_0003_0FF024AE6678C140">
&s;uit their Di&s;cour&s;es to the &s;tate of their Hearers: And it was with this <HI>View,</HI> the&s;e Sermons were fir&s;t Compos'd and De|livered from the Pulpit. But alas! 'tis no le&s;s grievous now, to find, how <HI>&s;oon</HI> and <HI>ea&s;ily</HI> the&s;e &s;olemn Impre&s;&s;ions are worn off the Minds of a great many, both Old and Young. Who, notwith&s;tanding their late Convictions and Vows for Re|formation, are returned to their former Evil Cour&s;es, <HI>as the Dog to his Vomit:</HI> and &s;o are fallen under the weight of that heavy Charge again&s;t <HI>Ephraim</HI> and <HI>Ju|dah,</HI> Ho&s;. <HI>6.4. O</HI> Ephraim, <HI>what &s;hall I do unto thee? O</HI> Judah, <HI>what &s;hall I do unto thee? for your Goodne&s;s is as the Morning Cloud, and as the early Dew it goeth away.</HI> And 'tis enough to make one's Heart and Fle&s;h to tremble, to think of the fearful Doom that awaits the&s;e Back&s;liders in Heart and Life. For, we have it from the mouth of GOD Him&s;elf, in Heb. <HI>10.38. Now the ju&s;t &s;hall live by Faith: but if any man draw back my &s;oul &s;hall have no plea&s;ure in him.</HI> And if any &s;uch Per&s;ons &s;hould ca&s;t an eye up|on the&s;e Pages, I be&s;eech you, for GOD's &s;ake, and for the &s;ake of your poor Souls, to look back, before it be too late, and Con|&s;ider, How many &s;trong Convictions you have &s;tifled, how many &s;olemn Vows and Pro|mi&s;es
<PB N="iii" REF="003231_0004_0FF024B0F5C75198">
you have broken, and what hopeful Beginnings you are fallen from; and then look forward, and behold the amazing Gulph of Endle&s;s Mi&s;eries you are plung|ing deep into. And, Oh, That GOD, of His infinite Mercy, would Revive your Con|victions, and bring you in earne&s;t to In|quire, what you mu&s;t do to be Saved; and &s;o pluck you as brands out of the Burning!</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding the Melancholy Pro&s;pect we have from the&s;e Revolters from GOD and Duty, There are (Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD for it) &s;ome Thou&s;ands in the Land upon whom the&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions do yet remain; and I hope will do &s;o to their dying Day. And 'tis no &s;mall Comfort to me to find &s;o many of this Character, in the Congrega|tion I belong to, and very particularly a|mong our Dear <HI>YOUNG PEOPLE,</HI> who are &s;till, <HI>Inquiring the way to Zion, with their faces thitherward.</HI></P>
<P>AND as an Help to them herein, a <HI>Number</HI> of them have earne&s;tly de&s;ired (and I have accordingly comply'd with their De&s;ires, in) the Publication of the&s;e Di&s;|cour&s;es. And how defective &s;oever they may be as to the <HI>manner</HI> of them, I am &s;ure the <HI>Subject</HI> of them is of infinite Im|portance. And therefore, tho' at &s;ome times they may be more peculiarly <HI>a Word in

Sea&s;on,</HI> as they were intended in the Preach|ing of them; yet, Di&s;cour&s;es of this kind, can never <HI>be out of Sea&s;on,</HI> while there are any Men in the World under the Con|demning Sentence of GOD's righteous Law, and &s;o &s;tand in ab&s;olute need of Eternal Salvation.</P>
<P>AND if the&s;e <HI>Sermons,</HI> mean as they are, &s;hould fall into the Hands of any, that are in deep Concern about the &s;tate of their Souls and another World, for whom they are chiefly de&s;igned; I hope, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, they will meet with &s;uch Di|rections in them, as may be of Service to them, <HI>in working out their Salvation with fear and trembling.</HI></P>
<P>AND if &s;uch poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Souls, or any el&s;e, &s;hould reap the lea&s;t Spiritual Benefit by them, my End is an&s;wered: And let GOD the <HI>CREATOR, REDEEMER,</HI> and <HI>SANCTIFIER</HI> have the whole Glory of it.</P>

<P>Sirs, What mu&s;t I do to be Saved?</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_ETERNAL Salvation is a matter of the greate&s;t Concern to every Sinner. And accordingly this In|quiry in the <HI>Text</HI> is u&s;u|ally the fir&s;t and great Inquiry of every one, that is thoroughly convinced of the mi&s;e|rable
<PB N="2" REF="003231_0007_0FF024BB4699E930">
and wretched &s;tate he is in by Na|ture. The apprehen&s;ions he has of his own Sin and Guilt, fill him with the deepe&s;t Concern about the &s;tate of his poor Soul and another World: And he de&s;ires nothing &s;o much as to know, what means he mu&s;t u&s;e, or what cour&s;e to take, to e&s;cape the Damnation of Hell, and come to enjoy the Happine&s;s of Heaven. This is a Subject that employs his tho'ts day and night. And he frequently thinks with him&s;elf, What a mi&s;erable Condition am I in? What &s;hall I do in this &s;ad &s;tate? How &s;hall I get out of it? What Cour&s;e &s;hall I take for this end? And he is ready to ask the&s;e Que&s;tions of every one whom he thinks able to give him any Light and Direction in a matter of &s;o great Importance.</P>
<P>AND in hopes this is the Ca&s;e with many of my Hearers at this day (having lately had the &s;ame loud call from GOD in His Providence, to awaken and rou&s;e you as the <HI>Jaylor</HI> had in our <HI>Context,</HI>) I &s;hall con&s;ider the Inquiry before us: And in the Pro&s;ecution of it, give the mo&s;t full and &s;atisfactory an&s;wer I can, to tho&s;e who make it in earne&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT before I come to the Point in hand, I &s;hall briefly con&s;ider the Con|text;
<PB N="3" REF="003231_0008_0FF024BD87274C80">
and &s;o lead you to the Occa&s;ion of the Words them&s;elves. And here if we look back to the <HI>ninth ver&s;e</HI> of this Chapter, we &s;hall find the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> had been called by God in a vi&s;ion to go over into <HI>Macedonia:</HI> which call he im|mediately obey'd; and &s;oon came to <HI>Philippi, the chief City of Macedonia, and a Colony,</HI> (ver. 10.12.) And being arriv|ed thither, he improved the fir&s;t oppor|tunity he had to preach the Go&s;pel of CHRIST, <HI>(ver.</HI> 13.) Whereupon follows an account of the &s;ucce&s;s of his Mini&s;try in the Conver&s;ion of <HI>Lydia,</HI> and his <HI>ca&s;t|ing out an evil &s;pirit that had po&s;&s;e&s;t a Dam&s;el</HI> in tho&s;e parts, (<HI>ver.</HI> 14,&mdash; 19.) But her Ma&s;ters had made their Advan|tage of her heretofore by her Divination, (<HI>ver</HI> 16.) they were enraged at the A|po&s;tle for the lo&s;s they &s;u&s;tained in her Conver&s;ion to Chri&s;tianity; and &s;o rai&s;|ed a grievous Per&s;ecution again&s;t the A|po&s;tle and <HI>Silas,</HI> his Companion and Fellow-labourer. Upon which they were both cruelly &s;courged, and ca&s;t into Pri|&s;on, by order of Government (<HI>ver.</HI> 22, 23.) This being done; the <HI>Jaylor</HI> to make good his Tru&s;t, <HI>thru&s;t them into the inner Pri&s;on,</HI> or Dungeon, where none were u&s;ually put but condemned Malefactors: but as if this were not enough, <HI>he made
<PB N="4" REF="003231_0009_0FF024C0596E9308">
their feet fa&s;t in the Stocks;</HI> re&s;olving to load them with all the indignity and mi&s;ery he could do. Under this cruel treatment tho&s;e Servants of CHRIST took Courage, and comforted them&s;elves in GOD; rejoycing, no doubt, that they were counted worthy to &s;uffer &s;uch &s;hame for the &s;ake of their dear LORD. And therefore we read in ver. 25. <HI>At midnight Paul and Silas prayed and &s;ang prai&s;es unto God;</HI> and with &s;o loud and chearful a Voice that <HI>the Pri&s;oners heard them.</HI> Whereupon GOD immediately appeared in a very awful and &s;urprizing manner, both to vindicate the Innocence of his &s;uffering Servants, and to te&s;tify his great Di&s;plea&s;ure at their malicious Per&s;ecutors. For we read in ver. 26. <HI>And &s;uddenly there was a great Earthquake; &s;o that the foundations of the Pri&s;on were &s;haken.</HI> How far there might be the mini&s;try of &s;econd Cau&s;es in this amazing Di&s;pen&s;a|tion, we know not: but yet this we are &s;ure of, there was the Hand of Heaven remarkably in it; and &s;omething very extraordinary, if not miraculous, as ap|pears by the Effects, or rather the Atten|dants of it: For it is &s;aid in this &s;ame ver&s;e, <HI>And immediately all the doors were opened, and every ones bonds were loo&s;ed.</HI> It is pro|bable this opening the Doors of the
<PB N="5" REF="003231_0010_0FF024C3DE9475F0">
Pri&s;on, and loo&s;ing the bands of the Pri|&s;oners were not by the violence of the Earthquake, but by the mini&s;try of an Angel; as in <HI>Peters</HI> ca&s;e, <HI>Act.</HI> 5.19. But yet they were effected at the &s;ame In&s;tant when the Walls of the Pri&s;on, and no doubt all the Hou&s;es in the Town were tottering and ready to tumble into Ruins, by the dreadful Quaking of the Earth un|der them: And by this means the Di&s;pen|&s;ation appeared more awful and amazing. And now as to the <HI>Effects</HI> of this &s;urpri|zing Providence upon the Minds of Men: There is no Que&s;tion to be made, but all the People in the City were thrown into an amazing Fright by it; as we were t'other Night by the like Di&s;pen&s;ation. But my Text leads me to con&s;ider only the Ca&s;e of the Jaylor; and the Im|pre&s;&s;ions it made upon him. And accord|ingly we read in ver. 27th. <HI>That the Keeper of the Pri&s;on awaked out of &s;leep;</HI> 'tis likely by the great Shock of the Earth|quake; and <HI>&s;eeing the Pri&s;on Doors open,</HI> he <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> at fir&s;t, as well he might, <HI>that all the Pri&s;oners were fied.</HI> And this fill'd him with new Terrors; for tho' the Earth had not opened her mouth and &s;wallowed him alive, as a minute or two before he tho't it wou'd have done, yet now he ap|prehended him&s;elf in fre&s;h hazard of lo&s;ing
<PB N="6" REF="003231_0011_0FF024C5709560C0">
his Life, and in a mo&s;t ignominious man|ner, by the hands of the Magi&s;trates; for the <HI>Roman</HI> Law was very &s;evere in this ca&s;e, and made it a Capital Crime for a Pri&s;on-keeper to let any of his Pri&s;oners e&s;cape. And accordingly the Severity of it had, not long before, been executed upon the Keepers, out of who&s;e hands the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> had e&s;caped, <HI>Act.</HI> 12.19. And therefore to avoid that kind of Death, the Jaylor at fir&s;t attempted in a mo&s;t un|natural manner to lay violent hands on him&s;elf: for <HI>he drew out his &s;word, and would have killed him&s;elf:</HI> See <HI>ver.</HI> 27. But <HI>Paul</HI> perceiving the intended Tra|gedy <HI>cried out with a loud voice,</HI> and &s;aid to the poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Wretch, <HI>Do thy &s;elf no harm: for we are all here,</HI> ver. 28. This voice of the Pri&s;oner was Life from the Dead to the Keeper of the Pri&s;on; whereupon he immediately laid a&s;ide his vile Purpo&s;e of murdering him&s;elf; and being at once convinced of the Innocency of <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas;</HI> of the truth of their Religion, and of the Almighty Power of that GOD who had &s;o &s;ignally appeared for them, <HI>He immediately called for a Light, and &s;prang in, and came trembling, and fell down</HI> before the&s;e Servants of the mo&s;t HIGH GOD, in token of Reverence and Re&s;pect to them, And being at the &s;ame
<PB N="7" REF="003231_0012_0FF024C7E9127B08">
time al&s;o convinced in a very wonderful manner of his own &s;inful and wretched &s;tate, and the hazard he was in of lo&s;ing his Soul forever; He puts this mo&s;t &s;eri|ous and important Que&s;tion to them in the words of my Text,&mdash; <HI>Sirs, What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI> He was now in as great Concern for the Life of his preci|ous Soul, as ju&s;t before he had been in, for the Life of his Body: And he knew of none &s;o fit, as <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas,</HI> to apply to for Coun&s;el and Direction in this mo&s;t important Affair. And therefore apply'd to them, in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful manner, for their &s;peedy Help &amp; Direction in this Ca&s;e, <HI>Sirs, What mu&s;t I do &amp;c?</HI> He was willing now to take any Advice, and to do any thing; yea, every thing in his power for the Salvation of his Soul: and therefore how to obtain this, was become his fir&s;t and chief Enquiry. Thus the Providence of GOD, that had ju&s;t before like to have co&s;t him and many more their Lives, prov'd a merciful Di&s;pen&s;ati|on to him: GOD made it a means to awaken him to purpo&s;e; and brought him hereby to Inquire in earne&s;t after Eternal Life. And &s;ince (as I hope) this is the very Ca&s;e with a con&s;iderable Number both here and el&s;ewhere, at this Time;
<PB N="8" REF="003231_0013_0FF024CA5941FCF8">
I &s;hall &s;peak to this DOCTRINE from the Text, as a Word in Sea&s;on to you,&mdash;</P>
<P>Namely,</P>
<P><HI>DOCT.</HI> WHENEVER a Sinner is thoroughly Convinced of his Sin and Danger, he is won't to make this his fir&s;t and great Inquiry, <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be Saved?</HI></P>
<P>So did the <HI>Jaylor</HI> in our Text; being brought into deep Convictions by the &s;urprizing Providence of GOD, as you have heard. And &s;o did the three thou|&s;and that were Convinced, at one time, by an awakning Sermon of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Pe|ter.</HI> The &s;tory of which we find in the <HI>&s;econd Chapter of the Acts:</HI> Where we have a brief account of the Sermon he preach'd to them, from the 14<HI>th. to the</HI> 16<HI>th. ver&s;e</HI> inclu&s;ively. And then we have an account of the impre&s;&s;ion it made upon them in <HI>ver.</HI> 27<HI>th. Now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart,</HI> i.e. They were deeply convinced, by the Word, of their Sin and Guilt. And upon this it follows, <HI>They &s;aid unto Peter, and the re&s;t of the Apo&s;tles, Men and brethren, What &s;hall we do?</HI> That is, What &s;hall we do to be &s;aved? The Que&s;tion is of the &s;ame import with that in the <HI>Text.</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="003231_0014_0FF024CF13FFC810">
They were now made &s;en&s;ible, they were &s;inful, guilty, undone Creatures in them|&s;elves, and &s;tood in infinite need of eter|nal Salvation: and upon this Conviction, the very fir&s;t thing they inquire after, is, What they &s;hall do to obtain the Pardon of their Sins, and the Salvation of their Souls. And we may ob&s;erve the like Concern in the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> at his Con|ver&s;ion, in the <HI>ninth Chapter of the Acts.</HI> He was convinced of his &s;in and danger, by a voice immediately from Heaven, <HI>&s;aying unto him, Saul, Saul, why per&s;e|cute&s;t thou me?</HI> ver. 4. And he was no &s;ooner made &s;en&s;ible from whence the voice came, and what the de&s;ign of it was, but with trembling &amp; a&s;toni&s;hment, at the pro&s;pect of his Sin and Guilt, he cries out, <HI>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</HI> As if he had &s;aid, Lord, my way has been perver&s;e before thee; I have greatly di&s;honoured and offended thee by my Sins; and expo&s;ed my &s;elf to thy dreadful wrath and vengeance; Oh, what &s;hall I do? Lord, teach me what Cour&s;e to take, to get my Sins pardoned and my Peace made with thee. Teach me how to live and walk that &s;o I may glorify thee in this World, and enjoy thy Salva|tion in the World to come. And thus if you meet with any Sinner that has been
<PB N="10" REF="003231_0015_0FF024D14E8792F0">
once thoroughly convinced of his Sin and Danger, either by the Word or Providence of GOD, you will &s;oon find, that this is the great Inquiry he is in pur&s;uit of; and what he de&s;ires above every thing to be re&s;olved in; namely, <HI>What &s;hall I do be &s;aved?</HI> What Cour&s;e &s;hall I &s;teer? What Steps &s;hall I take? What Means &s;hall I make u&s;e of, that may prove effectual for this End? This is enough to prove the Truth of the Point.</P>
<P>HERE then in the Pro&s;ecution of this Subject, I &s;hall ob&s;erve the following Method.</P>
<P N="1">I. I Shall &s;how, when a Sinner may be &s;aid to be thoroughly Convinced of his Sin and Danger.</P>
<P N="2">II. WHAT is implied in that Salvation, which &s;uch a Sinner &s;o earne&s;tly inquires after.</P>
<P N="3">III. SHOW the Nece&s;&s;ity and Impor|tance of the Sinners making this his fir&s;t and great Inquiry. And then,</P>
<P N="4">IV. SHOW what Steps a poor Con|vinced Sinner mu&s;t take to obtain Eternal Life, in an&s;wer to that Inquiry in the Text, <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. I Shall &s;how when a poor Sinner may be &s;aid to be thoroughly Convinced
<PB N="11" REF="003231_0016_0FF024D65BB0E9B8">
of his Sin and Danger: or what this CONVICTION implies in it.</P>
<P>AND here there are the&s;e Four things principally included in it.</P>
<P N="1">1. A deep &s;en&s;e of the <HI>evil</HI> and <HI>accur&s;ed Nature</HI> of Sin. Sin in it &s;elf is the very wor&s;t of Evils. There is nothing &s;o odi|ous in the nature of it, as Sin is. 'Tis far wor&s;e than any Evil of Puni&s;hment can be: for tho' <HI>penal</HI> Evil be de&s;tructive of the Creatures Happine&s;s; yet, as it is a Correction for Sin, and never inflicted by GOD but when Sins calls for it, there is both Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice in it. But Sin can in no &s;en&s;e be &s;aid to be good: For, in the very Nature of it, 'tis directly op|po&s;ite to all that is <HI>holy, ju&s;t and good.</HI> It is contrary to the mo&s;t pure and ble&s;&s;ed Nature of GOD; contrary to His ju&s;t and righteous Law; and is followed with the whole train of <HI>penal</HI> Evils, as the proper Demerit of it. And therefore he that has a due Conviction of Sin, has been a|wakened by the Spirit of GOD to &s;ee &s;omething of the odious and accur&s;ed Nature of Sin, as it is in it &s;elf. GOD has given him to &s;ee Sin in its horrid Con|trariety to His mo&s;t holy Nature &amp; Law; and that it de&s;erves to be hated &amp; ought to be abandoned on the account thereof. And accordingly, He is wounded to the
<PB N="12" REF="003231_0017_0FF024D9AADEB758">
Heart to think how injurious Sin is to GOD; How it oppo&s;es His holy Will; affronts His &s;upream Authority; Di&s;ho|nours His &s;acred Name; and &s;o how hate|ful it is to GOD on the account hereof. And from hence he can't but &s;ee and own the unrea&s;onable and odious Nature of Sin: and is ready at the Pro&s;pect of it to cry out, <Q>Oh, the accur&s;ed Thing! I hate the Name, I abhor the Nature of it: I now loath the Garments &s;potted with it; and if it were po&s;&s;ible, I would not have my Heart, nor my Hands de|filed with it for ten thou&s;and Worlds. Nay, in the Mind I am now in, I would &s;uffer any Affliction and Pain rather than touch the accur&s;ed Thing.</Q> And &s;o under this Conviction the Sinner is put upon flying from Sin as far as he can, and upon e&s;caping as many of the Temp|tations to it as he can do: And makes that Prayer to GOD, which CHRIST has taught us in this Ca&s;e, Math. 6.13. <HI>Lord, Lead me not into Temptation, but deliver me from Evil:</HI> from the Evil of Sin, which is &s;o hateful in thy &s;ight. Again,</P>
<P N="2">2. IN this Conviction there is a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the <HI>dreadful Demerit</HI> and <HI>Tenden|cy</HI> of Sin. For as Sin is a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Law of GOD, and ca&s;ts all manner of Reproach upon His Sacred Name and
<PB N="13" REF="003231_0018_0FF024DD4F6AA3D8">
Ways: there is no Puni&s;hment too &s;evere to be inflicted on the Guilty. For the Nature of Sin is &s;uch, "that it de&s;erves the Wrath and Cur&s;e of GOD both in this Life, and in that which is to come". And accordingly, they that are guilty of it, are cur&s;ed by the Law of GOD, Gal. 3.10. <HI>Cur&s;ed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the Law to do them.</HI> And they are doom'd to die on the account of it, Gen. 2.17. <HI>In the day thou eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die.</HI> And Rom. 6.23. <HI>The wages of &s;in is Death.</HI> This Death includes in it all outward Evils &amp; Mi&s;eries in this World, from the lea&s;t Pain of a Finger to the Death of the Body. Again, it includes in it all &s;piritual Plagues and Judgments in this Life; &s;uch as the An|ger of GOD; the Frowns of His Face; the Stings and La&s;hes of the Sinners own Con&s;cience; and GOD's delivering him up into the Hands of His &s;piritual Ene|mies, to be tyranized over, and hurried by them to Eternal Ruine. And therefore it al&s;o includes in it, the Everla&s;ting De|&s;truction of Soul and Body in Hell; which is eternal Death, and the thing principal|ly intended in the Threatning and Cur&s;e that is due for Sin. All this the convinced Sinner has an affecting Apprehen&s;ion of;
<PB N="14" REF="003231_0019_0FF024DF18BD7B18">
and can't but own the Ju&s;tice and Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of GOD in ordatning &s;uch a &s;e|vere Puni&s;hment for the workers of Ini|quity. And therefore,</P>
<P N="3">3. IN this Conviction the Sinner has a deep Sen&s;e of his own <HI>Guilt</HI> and <HI>Pollu|tion</HI> by Sin. For Sin is not only the mo&s;t hateful Thing in it&s;elf, and &s;o de&s;erves the Cur&s;e of GOD: but we are all of us horribly infected with the Plague of Sin, and de&s;erve the Vengeance of Heaven our &s;elves. For as the Prophet ob&s;erves, <HI>We are all of us as an unclean thing,</HI> I&s;ai. 64.6. From the Crown of the Head even to the &s;ole of the Feet, there is no &s;piri|tual &s;oundne&s;s in us; nothing but wounds and brui&s;es and putrifying &s;ores, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 1.6. And our Lives are naturally among the unclean. And being thus polluted with Sin, we de&s;erve nothing but Wrath and Death on the account of it. And &s;o are &s;aid to be by Nature, <HI>the Children of Wrath,</HI> Eph. 2.3. Now in true Con|viction, the Sinner has a deep &s;en&s;e of this his Pollution and Guilt by rea&s;on of Sin. GOD has &s;et his Iniquities in order before him; and bro't him to &s;ee what a vile Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or he has been. And ac|cordingly the Convinced Sinner is &s;en&s;i|ble of the Sins both of his Heart &amp; Life&punc; He &s;ees in &s;ome good mea&s;ure what an
<PB N="15" REF="003231_0020_0FF024E18F77B780">
evil Heart He has in him; an Heart full of mity to GOD, of Indi&s;po&s;ition to that which is Good, and inclined to all that is Evil. And as &s;uch an Heart can bring forth no good Fruit; &s;o he &s;ees that out of the evil Trea&s;ure of his Heart, he has brought forth nothing but Evil in his pa&s;t Life and Conver&s;ation: He &s;ees that his Days have been fill'd up with acts of Rebellion again&s;t GOD; that his Sins have been many and exceedingly aggra|vated; that he has &s;inned again&s;t the Light of his own Con&s;cience; &s;inned a|gain&s;t the Calls and Warnings of GOD, again&s;t His Mercies and Judgments, and the like. And &s;o he &s;tands ready to confe&s;s with the returning Prodigal, in Luk. 15.21. <HI>Father I have &s;inned again&s;t Heaven, and in thy &s;ight.</HI> And as he &s;ees him&s;elf &s;o great a Sinner, &s;o he appre|hends his own <HI>Pollution</HI> by Sin. He ju&s;t|ly concludes him&s;elf a mo&s;t vile and abo|minable Creature: and knows that GOD has infinite rea&s;on to abhor him forever And this &s;en&s;e of his own vilene&s;s makes him to loath him&s;elf for his own Iniqui|ties; and to confe&s;s with <HI>Job, Behold, I am vile &mdash; I abhor my &s;elf, and repent in Du&s;t and A&s;hes,</HI> Chap. 40.4.42.6. And with this &s;en&s;e of Pollution he conceives his own dreadful <HI>Guilt</HI> by rea&s;on of Sin.
<PB N="16" REF="003231_0021_0FF024E6C852DFE8">
He knows that he ju&s;tly de&s;erves Wrath and Hell on the account of his Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions: and &s;ees all the Cur&s;es and Threatnings that are written in the Book of Gods Law &s;tanding in full force again&s;t him: and &s;o apprehends him&s;elf a Mi&s;era|ble Condemned Wretch: one that has run a &s;wift Race in Sin, and been ripen|ing apace for the Damnation of Hell. And &s;o with the Jaylor in the Context, he trembles at the pro&s;pect of that Wrath that is due to him for his Sins; and can truly &s;ay with <HI>David,</HI> in P&s;al. 119.120. <HI>My fle&s;h trembleth for fear of thee: and I am afraid of thy judgments.</HI> Thus in true Conviction the Sinner has a deep &s;en&s;e of his own Pollution and Guilt by Sin.</P>
<P>And then,</P>
<P N="4">4. La&s;tly. IN this Conviction the Sin|ner is deeply &s;en&s;ible of his own <HI>utter Inability</HI> to Help and Save him&s;elf. For a true Conviction of the evil Nature and De&s;ert of Sin will &s;oon bring a Sinner to &s;ee, that it is not in his own Power nor in the Power of any meer Creature to a|tone the Wrath of GOD for his Sins, and obtain his relea&s;e from the Condemning Sentence of the Law. And therefore when the Convinced Sinner makes that Inquiry of him&s;elf, as we find in Mich. 5.6, 7. <HI>Wherewith &s;hall I come before the

Shall I give my fir&s;t-born for my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, the fruit of my body for the &s;in of my &s;oul?</HI> He pre&s;ently makes an&s;wer to him&s;elf, <Q>Oh, no! all this can never be a proper Atonement for Sin. <HI>Lebanon is not &s;ufficient to burn, nor the bea&s;ts thereof for a burnt offering.</HI> Nay, &s;uch is the Nature of my Sins, and the Nature of that GOD again&s;t whom I have &s;in|ned; that a Sacrifice of the whole Creation, if I had it to offer, could not &s;atisfy Divine Ju&s;tice for the lea&s;t of my Offences.</Q> And then be&s;ides, would GOD accept the lea&s;t good at our hands as an Atonement for Sin; He that is thoroughly Convinced, &s;ees that he has nothing of his own, that has the lea&s;t value in it; and that he can do no|thing of him&s;elf, that is any ways worthy of GOD's Acceptance. And therefore, he looks upon his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s but as filthy Rags, and can &s;ee no Hope, no Help for him in the compa&s;s of the Crea|tion.</P>
<P>THUS I have given you &s;omething of the Nature of true Conviction of Sin,

<P><HI>Infer.</HI> 1. DOES Conviction of Sin im|ply in it &s;uch things as we have heard? Hence learn that this Conviction is the Work of the SPIRIT of GOD.

and of thy own Pollution and Guilt by rea&s;on of it: This can never be the Work of Corrupt Nature; for that is always in love with Sin: nor the Work of the Devil, for his main Bu&s;ine&s;s is to hide your Sin and Danger from you; that he may make the ea&s;ier and &s;urer Prey of you to your everla&s;ting undoing. Well then, it mu&s;t be the Work of the Spirit of GOD.

<HEAD>SERMON II.</HEAD>
<P N="2">II. _I Proceed to the Second ge|neral Head under the Doc|trine, and this is to &s;how what is <HI>imply'd</HI> in that SALVATI|ON which the Convinced Sinner &s;o ear|ne&s;tly enquires after. Every Sinner, as I &s;aid, that is timely Convinced, is bro't in|to deep Concern for Eternal Salvation. This is what he longs for, Enquires and Seeks after, while his Convictions abide by Him. It is worth while therefore to Enquire a little into the Nature of this Salvation, to &s;ee whether &s;uch a Sinner be Rational in his De&s;ires and Pur&s;uits. And accordingly, if we con&s;ider the Point a while, we &s;hall find He has infinite Rea|&s;on for the utmo&s;t Concern about it. For there are the&s;e two things in general im|ply'd in it.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="22" REF="003231_0027_0FF024F86C3FD1E0">1. A Deliverance from the Cur&s;e of the Law, to which every Sinner is obnoxious, by the breach of the fir&s;t Covenant.</P>
<P N="2">2. A &s;ure Right and Title to the glo|rious and invaluable Priviledges and Be|nefits of the New-Covenant.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) This Salvation comprehends in it, a Deliverance from <HI>the Cur&s;e of the Law,</HI> to which every Sinner is obnoxious by the Breach of the fir&s;t Covenant. That God entred into Covenant with our fir&s;t Parents before the Fall, is plain from the Hi&s;tory of our Creation. For therein we find that as &s;oon as God made man in his own Image, which con&s;i&s;ted in Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s and true Holine&s;s, He gave him a Law to walk by; a Law &s;uited to the Dignity of the Great Law-giver and the State of the Subject. This Law was con|firm'd at the &s;ame time with the mo&s;t for|cible <HI>Sanctions</HI>: with the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> of Life on Condition of perfect and per&s;evering Obedience, and with the <HI>Threatning</HI> of Death and Mi&s;ery in Ca&s;e of Di&s;obedi+ence. And the&s;e Terms, without Doubt were cheerfully &s;ubmitted to by Man in a State of Innocency: and from hence re+&s;ulted the Nature of a Covenant between God and Man. And this we call the <HI>fir&s;t
<PB N="23" REF="003231_0028_0FF024FB174EBC60">
Covenant,</HI> or <HI>Covenant of Works.</HI> Now this Covenant was no &s;ooner made be|tween God and Man, but it was broken on our part. The way and manner in which it was thus violated, is expre&s;ly declared to us in the Story of our &s;hame|ful Apo&s;tacy from God: which you may read at large in the <HI>Third Chapter of Ge|ne&s;is.</HI> This Breach of Covenant expo&s;ed poor Man at once to the whole Cur&s;e of the Law: For 'tis written <HI>Cur&s;ed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the book of the Law to do them,</HI> Gal. 3.10. The &s;ub&s;tance of this Cur&s;e, as I &s;aid be|fore, is Death of every kind. And there|fore the Evils contain'd in it are incon|ceivably great and dreadful. It implies in it a forfeiture of all the Good, the Sin|ner has in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or ever had a Right and Title to; and a &s;ubjection to all Po|&s;itive Evil. For he that is under the Cur&s;e of the Law, has forfeited and lo&s;t the Fa|vour of GOD, and lies open to all the a|mazing &s;trokes of revenging Ju&s;tice. And therefore the Sinner de&s;erves, and &s;o the lea&s;t he has any Rea&s;on to expect from the Hands of an holy Sin-revenging GOD, is <HI>eternal Indignation &amp; Wrath, Tribula|tion and Angui&s;h:</HI> and he has no other rational Pro&s;pect before him, but <HI>a certain
<PB N="24" REF="003231_0029_0FF024FE2964AA18">
fearful looking for of Judgment, and fiery Indignation, which &s;hall devour the Ad|ver&s;ary.</HI> See Heb. 10.27. This is the la|mentable Condition of every one that is under the Cur&s;e; and &s;o the doleful &s;tate of every one of us by Nature. And it is upon this deplorable account alone, that we &s;tand in need of Salvation. For had we never violated the holy Law of GOD, we had for ever been &s;ecure in the Favour and Enjoyment of GOD, which is Life Eternal. But by the mo&s;t perfidious Breach of GOD's Covenant, we have brought our &s;elves into the depth of that Mi&s;ery, I have now de&s;cribed. And it is not po&s;&s;ible we &s;hould ever be happy without a compleat Redemption from it. And therefore the Salvation we are &s;peak|ing of nece&s;&s;arily implies this Redemption in it.</P>
<P>Here then I &s;hall &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. THIS Salvation implies in it, a Deli|verance from <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Lu&s;t.</HI> As Man's A|po&s;tacy from GOD, &amp; the mi&s;erable &s;tate he is fallen into, began with his Sin and Rebellion again&s;t GOD; &s;o from that time Sin took a full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our Na|ture, and &s;et up an ab&s;olute Empire, in e|very unregenerate Sinner. And therefore
<PB N="25" REF="003231_0030_0FF02501C2AF0300">
all &s;uch Sinners are &s;aid to be <HI>the &s;ervants of Sin,</HI> Rom. 6.17. Now, tho' carnal Sinners them&s;elves are not &s;en&s;ible of it; this &s;ubjection to Sin and Lu&s;t is the great|e&s;t part of the Mi&s;ery we are plung'd in|to by the Fall. For as Sin at fir&s;t brought down the Cur&s;e of GOD upon us; &s;o this &s;ubjection to Sin keeps us &s;till under the Cur&s;e; and there is no getting free from the Chains of it, but by getting loo&s;e from the Power and Dominion of Sin. And therefore a Deliverance in this re&s;|pect is e&s;&s;ential to the Sinners Salvation. And accordingly the Heirs of Salvation are &s;aid <HI>to be made free from Sin,</HI> Rom. 6.18. i.e. They are delivered from the reign|ing Power and Dominion of Sin, and in part from the Pollution of it, in their Re|generation and Sanctification by the Spirit of GOD, while they are in this World, and they &s;hall be wholly freed from the Rage and Tyranny of Sin, from the Pollution and De|filement of it, and from the very <HI>in-being</HI> of it, in the World to come. And this is &s;o glorious a part of our Salvation, that the Saint longs for nothing more than to be thus entirely and everla&s;tingly &s;et at Liberty from Sin, and therefore he daily groans out his De&s;ires in that pathetical Language, Rom. 6.24. <HI>Oh, wretched man
<PB N="26" REF="003231_0031_0FF0250369B99078">
that I am, who &s;hall deliver me from the body of this death?</HI></P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P N="2">2. IT implies in it a Deliverance from the <HI>Power of our &s;piritual Enemies.</HI> While Sinners are under the Cur&s;e of GOD's Law they are in &s;lavery to the Powers of Darkne&s;s. And therefore are called <HI>the Children of the Devil,</HI> and &s;aid to <HI>do his Lu&s;ts,</HI> Joh. 8.44. And the Devil him&s;elf is called, <HI>the Prince of the power of the Air, the &s;pirit that now worketh in the children of Di&s;obedience,</HI> Eph. 2.2. Now this is a doleful part of that Mi&s;ery which the Apo&s;tacy has thrown us into. For while Sinners are in this &s;lavery to the Powers of Darkne&s;s, they are Enemies to GOD, and are hurried on by the Devil in their Rebellion again&s;t Heaven, and &s;o are ripening apace for the vengeance of Eternal Fire; where, without timely Repentance, the wicked Spirits that now rule in them, will be their Tormentors for ever and ever. And therefore a De|liverance from the Power of the&s;e our &s;piritual Enemies, is a nece&s;&s;ary part of the Sinners Eternal Salvation. And ac|cordingly the Saints of the mo&s;t High, are &s;aid <HI>to be &s;aved from the hands of their &s;piritual Enemies, and from the hand of all
<PB N="27" REF="003231_0032_0FF02507F7CD9948">
that hate them.</HI> And again, <HI>to be deliver|ed out of their hands,</HI> Luk. 1.71, 74. This Deliverance is begun in this World; and every true Believer is tran&s;lated, by the Grace of GOD, out of the <HI>Kingdom of Satan into the Kingdom of his dear Son,</HI> Col. 1.13. And therefore tho' Satan may a&s;&s;ault and buffet him, by his Temptati|ons, and &s;ometimes foil him in his Com|bat with him, yet, he &s;hall never more have Dominion over the Saint. For GOD will finally crown all His Children with everla&s;ting Victory and Triumph in His eternal Kingdom, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.21. Now this part of our Salvation is what eve|ry true Believer longs and prays for. For he meets with &s;o great Oppo&s;ition at pre|&s;ent from the Powers of Darkne&s;s, and &s;o much Difficulty and Di&s;tre&s;s from them in his Chri&s;tian Race, that he would give ten thou&s;and Worlds to be conducted &s;afely beyond the reach of them.</P>
<P>And then,</P>
<P N="3">3. THIS Salvation implies a deliver|ance from the <HI>Guilt of Sin</HI> and the Con|demning Sentence of Gods Righteous Law. Now the Guilt of Sin is nothing le&s;s than the Sinners Obligation to &s;uffer the dreadful Penalty that is due for Sin.
<PB N="28" REF="003231_0033_0FF0250C573FBC88">
And accordingly while the Sinner is un|der the Power of Guilt, he is under the Condemning Sentence of God's holy Law, and doom'd to &s;uffer all the Plagues and Cur&s;es that are written in it. And there|fore all unbelievers are &s;aid to <HI>be condem|ned already,</HI> Joh. 3.18. Now in the Sinners Salvation, this Guilt is removed by a Pardon, and the Condemning Sen|tence of the Law is taken off in his Ju&s;|tification by the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t. And agreeably, we read in Rom. 8.1. <HI>There is therefore now no Condemnation to them that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who walk not after the fle&s;h, but after the &s;pirit.</HI> And this is &s;o great and nece&s;&s;ary a part of our Salvation that a poor convinced Sinner, who has a true &s;ight and &s;en&s;e of his own Sins; and &s;ees what a guilty Condemned Wretch he is, wou'd freely give all he has in the World, to have any A&s;&s;urance that his Sins were Pardoned, and that he &s;hall not be Condemned for them at the awful Tribunal of Chri&s;t at the great Day.</P>
<P>And accordingly,</P>
<P N="4">4. La&s;tly, THIS Salvation implies in it everla&s;ting &s;ecurity from the amazing <HI>wrath</HI> and <HI>vengeance</HI> of GOD in the World to come. As every unregenerate Sinner is under the Guilt of Sin and the Con|demning
<PB N="29" REF="003231_0034_0FF0250EDF3C9CD0">
Sentence of Gods Law; &s;o he is every Moment in infinite Hazard of fall|ing under the dreadful weight of His Eter|nal Indignation. And therefore &s;uch Sin|ners are expre&s;ly called <HI>the children of Wrath,</HI> Eph. 2.3. And what a fearful thing is it, thus to fall into the hands of the living GOD! And what wou'd not a poor Condemned Sinner give, to obtain full &s;ecurity from this tremendous Wrath to come? Now in that glorious Salvati|on which is offered to us in the Go&s;pel, this Security is contain'd, and every Saint &s;hall eternally be delivered from the Wrath of GOD, and the Torments of Hell in the World to come. This is cer|tain from the words of our Saviour Him|&s;elf, Joh. 5.24. <HI>Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you, he that heareth my word, and believeth on him that &s;ent me, hath everla&s;ting life, and &s;hall not come into condemnation; but is pa&s;&s;ed from death to life.</HI> And thus you &s;ee in the&s;e Particulars, what the Sinners Deliverance from the Cur&s;e of the Law implies in it; and how great and nece&s;|&s;ary a part it is of our Eternal Salvation. Nay, this Deliverance from the Cur&s;e is the fir&s;t and mo&s;t proper notion we have of Salvation. But then as this Salvation is apply'd to the Ca&s;e of Apo&s;tate Man's Recovery by JESUS CHRIST; it compre|hends
<PB N="30" REF="003231_0035_0FF0251162882620">
in it all the Happine&s;s Believers &s;hall ever attain to in and thro' Him.</P>
<P>And therefore,</P>
<P N="2">(2.) THE other great and Comprehen|&s;ive Article in our Salvation, is, a Right and Title to all the <HI>Priviledges</HI> contain|ed in the New Covenant. It is no more certain, That GOD entred into a Cove|nant of Works with Man at his Creation; the Priviledges of which we forfeited and lo&s;t by the Apo&s;tacy; than it is evident, He has graciou&s;ly conde&s;cended to enter into a New Covenant with us, in &amp; thro' a Mediator: which we u&s;ually call <HI>the Covenant of Grace.</HI> Now in this Cove|nant we have not only the offer of ever|la&s;ting Security from all the Mi&s;eries of the Fall (which we &s;pake to under the former Head:) but there are many other glorious and ine&s;timable Priviledges con|tained in it: which we call the Po&s;itive Ble&s;&s;ings of the New Covenant; and are e&s;&s;ential to eternal Salvation.</P>
<P>And agreably I &s;hall &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. OUR Eternal Salvation implies in it the <HI>Renovation</HI> and <HI>Sanctification</HI> of our Natures. For every Sinner that is bro't
<PB N="31" REF="003231_0036_0FF025132C6DD720">
into a &s;tate of Salvation, is made a new Creature. All old things are done away, and behold all things are become new in him. Hence he is &s;aid to <HI>put off con|cerning the former Conver&s;ation, the old man, which is corrupt according to deceit|ful lu&s;ts:</HI> and to <HI>be renewed in the &s;pirit of his mind; and to put on the new man, which after God is created in righteou&s;|ne&s;s and true holine&s;s,</HI> Eph. 4.22, 23, 24. And this is the Work of Almighty Power and Grace: and therefore they that are thus renewed are &s;aid to <HI>be born of the Spirit,</HI> Joh. 3.5. And that Work which is &s;o happily begun in Regeneration, is daily carried on to greater Degrees of Perfection in the renewed Sinners Sancti|fication; and this al&s;o being wrought by the Spirit of the LORD JESUS CHRIST, Believers are &s;aid to be <HI>&s;anctified in him,</HI> 1 Cor. 1.2. Now this Renovation and Sanctification of a Sinner is the beginning of Eternal Salvation. For the Applica|tion of Redemption by CHRIST begins in it. And when a Sinner is thus Created a new in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, he is brought im|mediately to enjoy many of the Privi|ledges of Redemption, and obtains a &s;ure Title to all the re&s;t of them.</P>
<P>Hence,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="32" REF="003231_0037_0FF02515AB497390">2. THIS Salvation implies in it <HI>Peace</HI> with GOD, in and thro' JESUS CHRIST. For as the Fall &s;et Man at an infinite Di&s;tance from God, and bred an Enmity between them; which proves fatal to every Sinner, that dies in his Natural Condition: &s;o whenever a poor Sinner is brought into a &s;tate of Salvation, this Enmity between GOD and the Sinner is removed, and they are brought into a &s;tate of Reconciliation one to another. For the renewed Man, having the Image of GOD &s;tampt upon him, has no longer any reigning Enmity in his Heart again&s;t GOD, but loves and delights in Him from that Day forward; and accordingly, GOD pardons and ju&s;tifies, and &s;o is at Peace with the Sinner, from the moment he is enabled to clo&s;e in with Chri&s;t by Faith. Hence that in Rom. 5.1. <HI>Therefore being ju&s;tified by faith, we have peace with God, thro' our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> And there|fore this Peace is another glorious Arti|cle in the Saint's Salvation, and fills him with Joy un&s;peakable whenever he has a &s;en&s;e of it. And then,</P>
<P N="3">3. THIS Salvation includes the Saint <HI>Adoption</HI> in it. For every one that is re|newed by the Spirit of GOD, and bro't in|to

a &s;tate of Peace with Him, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is al&s;o taken into the Number of his Children. Joh. 1.12. <HI>But as many as received him to them gave he power to become the &s;ons of God: even to them that believe on his name.</HI> And this is a very comprehen&s;ive Article in the Saints Sal|vation: For as &s;oon as ever the Believer is bro't into the Relation of a Child to GOD, he has the Nature and Spirit of a Child given to him: He has the Holy Fear and Love, the Reverence and De|light of a Child in him; and receives the Spirit of Adoption, whereby he is ena|bled to go to GOD as his Heavenly Fa|ther, and open all the Wants, and Fears, and Burdens of his poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Soul before him. And on the other hand, GOD has the tender Compa&s;&s;ions &amp; Bow|els of a Father towards tho&s;e whom he graciou&s;ly Adopts. And accordingly, His Ear is always open to hear their Cries to Him for Mercy. He pities them under all their Di&s;tre&s;&s;es; Comforts them under all their Sorrows; Supports them under all their Weakne&s;&s;es; and &s;upplies all their Nece&s;&s;ities for them: and has more|over provided a Glorious Inheritance for them in His Eternal Kingdom. This with much more of the like Nature is included in the Saints <HI>Adoption.</HI> And
<PB N="34" REF="003231_0039_0FF0251DA1049F18">
therefore this Article of Adoption is one of the mo&s;t Glorious Privileges of the New-Covenant. And then,</P>
<P N="4">4. THIS Salvation implies all that <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Strength</HI> that is nece&s;&s;ary to help and a&s;&s;i&s;t the Saint to the end of his Chri&s;tian Race. For as the Saint has a great deal to do in the way to GOD's Kingdom: many Difficulties to encoun|ter; many Temptations to re&s;i&s;t; many Enemies to conquer; many great and difficult Duties to engage in, and go thro' with; and no &s;trength of his own equal to the lea&s;t of them: He needs the &s;pecial Pre&s;ence of the Holy Spirit, to direct, a&s;&s;i&s;t and carry Him thro' all, to the Ho|nour and Acceptance of GOD&punc; And accordingly, this is &s;ecured to the Belie|ver in the New-Covenant. As we find in I&s;ai. 41.10. <HI>Fear thou not, for I am with thee: be not di&s;mayed for I am thy God: I will &s;trengthen thee, yea, I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> And in 2 Cor. 12.9. <HI>My Grace is &s;ufficient for thee: for my &s;trength is made perfect in weakne&s;s.</HI> And therefore tho' the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t &s;en&s;e of his utter In&s;ufficiency to perform any Du+ty aright in his own &s;trength, as we find in

2 Cor. 3.5. yet el&s;ewhere he is confident in this, Phil. 4.13. <HI>I can do all things through Chri&s;t which &s;trengtheneth me.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore,</P>
<P N="5">5. THIS Salvation implies in it the full and eternal Enjoyment of all the <HI>Glory</HI> and <HI>Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s</HI> of HEAVEN in the World to come. This is the la&s;t and principal Thing contained in Eternal Salvation, and the Perfection of it. And the Hap|pine&s;s of tho&s;e that enjoy it, is &s;o great that 'tis not po&s;&s;ible for any one to de&s;|cribe it: Nay, 'tis &s;o glorious, that <HI>Eye has not &s;een, nor Ear heard, neither has it entred into the Heart of man,</HI> in this mor|tal &s;tate, to conceive <HI>of the Things which God has prepared for them that love him,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.9. I will therefore only &s;ay, That the &s;ub&s;tance of it con&s;i&s;ts in the immediate, full, and eternal ENJOYMENT of GOD and CHRIST, in the Kingdom of Heaven. And therefore the Happine&s;s flowing from thence mu&s;t needs be an infinite Happine&s;s. And accordingly <HI>Da|vid</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, by <HI>fulne&s;s of Joy, and Plea&s;ures for evermore,</HI> P&s;al. 16.11. And a&s;&s;ures him&s;elf <HI>in the la&s;t ver&s;e of the next P&s;alm; As for me, I &s;hall behold thy face in Righteou&s;ne&s;s: I &s;hall be &s;atisfied when I awake with thy likene&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="003231_0041_0FF025255B5BEFD0">AND thus, upon the whole, I have given you a &s;hort and imperfect Account of that Salvation, which is the &s;ubject-matter of the Inquiry in our Text. And this was the <HI>&s;econd Thing</HI> I propo&s;ed to &s;peak to under the Doctrine.</P>
<P>And therefore,</P>
<P N="3">III. I proceed now to the <HI>next</HI> General Head: And this is to &s;how the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> and <HI>Importance</HI> of the Sinners making this Inquiry after Salvation his fir&s;t and great Inquiry. And here I &s;hall apply my &s;elf chiefly to &s;uch Sinners as are yet in a &s;tate of Carnal Security; and endea|vour, by &s;ome proper Con&s;iderations, to awaken in them that Conviction, which was &s;poken to under the fir&s;t Head: and hereby bring them to inquire in earne&s;t after that Salvation, which I gave you &s;ome Account of in the next place; and &s;o make way for their clo&s;e and &s;erious Attention to that Solemn Advice which is the principal Subject of the&s;e Di&s;cour|&s;es. And there are the&s;e two or three Con&s;iderations, which I &s;hall briefly men|tion; and which, by the Grace of GOD, may very much &s;erve my pre&s;ent De&s;ign.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="37" REF="003231_0042_0FF0252BC3DFBEB8">1. THE <HI>Nature</HI> of Eternal Salvation is &s;uch, that 'tis richly worth a while for every Sinner to be chiefly concern'd about it. For do but con&s;ider the &s;hort and imperfect Account I have given of this matter, under the la&s;t general Head; and then judge Whether there is any thing in the World to compare with this Salvation: Whether there are any <HI>Evils</HI> in this Life to compare with <HI>tho&s;e</HI> which this Salva|tion delivers us from: Or whether any of the <HI>good things</HI> here below may &s;tand in Competition with <HI>tho&s;e</HI> which the Saint &s;hall enjoy in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Eternal Life. I am &s;ure there is no rea&s;onable or con&s;iderate Per&s;on will own there is any Compari&s;on between them. For whereas the greate&s;t outward Evils we are liable to in this World, are &s;aid to be but <HI>light and moment any;</HI> the &s;piritual Plagues and Judgments the Sinner is &s;ub|ject to, are <HI>intolerable</HI> and <HI>eternal.</HI> And whereas, on the other hand, the be&s;t things of time and &s;en&s;e, are fading and tran&s;itory in their Nature, and un&s;atis|factory in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Enjoyment of them; the Spiritual Priviledges and Ble&s;&s;ings of our Redemption by CHRIST are Eternal in their Nature and Duration, and afford infinite Satisfaction to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of them. And now &s;ince Men,
<PB N="38" REF="003231_0043_0FF0252E6C608CC8">
from the &s;en&s;ible Experience they have both of outward Pro&s;perity and Adver&s;ity, are agreed in this, as an e&s;tabli&s;hed Law of Nature, that 'tis both their Duty and Intere&s;t to e&s;cape as many of the Evils of Life, and enjoy as many of the Com|forts of it as they can, while they live; and &s;carce think any Pains too much, to accompli&s;h their de&s;ire in the&s;e re&s;pects: it mu&s;t needs be a matter of va&s;tly greater Importance to them to &s;eek after Eternal Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. And when they have once &s;ecured an Intere&s;t in it, this will beyond all Compari&s;on more richly Recompence their utmo&s;t Labour and Co&s;t in the Pur|&s;uit of it. Nay, the very lea&s;t of all the peculiar Privileges and Ble&s;&s;ings of the New Covenant, will be of infinitely greater Advantage to the Sinner, than if he had all the Riches, Honours, and Plea|&s;ures of this Life at his Command. Where then &s;hall we find the Tongue that has Eloquence enough to de&s;cribe, or the Under&s;tanding that has Largene&s;s enough to conceive, what the Believers Gains are, when he has once pa&s;t from Death to Life? and &s;o comes to enjoy all the precious Privileges of a &s;tate of Grace in this World? and has the Covenant Truth and Faithfulne&s;s of GOD to rely upon, for the immediate Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Enjoyment
<PB N="39" REF="003231_0044_0FF02530B63F19A8">
of all the Glories of Heaven, in the World to come? Oh then, as you would be wi&s;e for your &s;elves, and lay out your Time and Strength to your infinite Advan|tage, let this Salvation be the great Sub|ject of your be&s;t Inquiry &amp; Endeavours: and keep that Direction of the wi&s;e man always in your eye, Prov. 4.7. <HI>Wi&s;dom is the principal thing, therefore get wi&s;dom: and with all thy getting, get under&s;tand|ing.</HI> Again,</P>
<P N="2">2. THE <HI>Ab&s;olute need</HI> we &s;tand in of Eternal Salvation may &s;erve to convince you of the great Nece&s;&s;ity &amp; Importance of making this Inquiry after Salvation your fir&s;t and great Inquiry. For Eternal Life is a matter of &s;o great moment to every Sinner, that unle&s;s he obtains an Intere&s;t in it, he is undone for ever. For, as you heard before, by the Apo&s;tacy of our fir&s;t Parents, we all of us fell under the dreadful Cur&s;e of the Law, and im|mediately became &s;laves to Sin, and &s;ub|jects to the Powers of Darkne&s;s, in this World; and obnoxious to the Eternal Vengeance of GOD, in the World to come. And there is no getting loo&s;e from the Chains of Guilt and Wrath, but by an Intere&s;t in that Salvation we are &s;peaking of. For as long as any Sinner
<PB N="40" REF="003231_0045_0FF0253379F56700">
continues in his natural &s;tate, his Heart is full of reigning Enmity again&s;t GOD and Holine&s;s: He lives in Sin, and de|lights in nothing but Rebellion again&s;t GOD: and &s;o daily trea&s;ures up to him|&s;elf Wrath again&s;t the Day of Wrath, and revelation of the righteous Judgment of GOD. And if he &s;hould die in this &s;tate of Nature, he'l die under the full weight of the Cur&s;e, and &s;ink under the intole|rable Load, into endle&s;s, ea&s;ele&s;s and re|medilous Torments, beyond all po&s;&s;ibility or hope of Recovery. And therefore, if you can think it any ways nece&s;&s;ary for you to e&s;cape the in&s;upportable Mi&s;eries and Torments of the bottomle&s;s Pit, you mu&s;t think it equally nece&s;&s;ary to inquire and &s;eek after Eternal Salvation. For 'tis this alone that can &s;et you at Liberty from the amazing Cur&s;e of the Law, and &s;ecure you from that Wrath of GOD which is infinitely more bitter than Death. This we are &s;ure of, from what I &s;aid was contain'd in our Redemption by Chri&s;t. And now, Sinner, what do you think of the matter? Is Sal|vation nece&s;&s;ary for you, or no? Or, are you &s;till indifferent, whether you are ever delivered or not, from the eternal Wrath and Cur&s;e of an Almighty Sin-revenging GOD? I am &s;ure if you are not fa&s;t
<PB N="41" REF="003231_0046_0FF02536C5C1ADB8">
a&s;leep in Sin, you mu&s;t have &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of the dreadful Wrath of GOD, that hangs over your Head, as to make you concern'd, above all things, to get out of the reach of it. And if your Con&s;cience is but a|wake, as it &s;hould be, you can't but cry out in agony of Soul, Oh, what &s;hall I do to be &s;aved? How &s;hall I e&s;cape the ama|zing Vengeance that is ready to fall upon me? and &s;ink me down into Eternal Per|dition? And the rather for what I &s;hall ob&s;erve to you in the la&s;t place, Namely,</P>
<P N="3">3. THERE is no obtaining an Intere&s;t in Eternal Salvation without making the Inquiry after it our fir&s;t and great Inquiry. And this &s;hows us the va&s;t Importance, yea, the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of this &s;ort of Inquiry. For as Eternal Salvation is a matter of the mo&s;t weighty Concern in it&s;elf; GOD will never be&s;tow the Ble&s;&s;ing upon any Sinners, unle&s;s they &s;ee the ine&s;timable Worth of it, and have a due &s;en&s;e of the ab&s;olute need they &s;tand in of it; and &s;o are put upon Inquiring and &s;eeking after it with the greate&s;t Care and Diligence. For if GOD &s;hould be&s;tow the Mercy upon any el&s;e, they would but de&s;pi&s;e, abu&s;e, and even trample upon His Grace and Goodne&s;s therein; and &s;o, in effect, He would but throw away the riche&s;t Gift
<PB N="42" REF="003231_0047_0FF0253A27EF7AF0">
he has to be&s;tow, and not get the lea&s;t Glory to Him&s;elf, in &s;o doing. We mu&s;t not therefore imagine that any Sinner, while he continues in a &s;en&s;ele&s;s, uncon|cerned frame of &s;pirit, can ever obtain an intere&s;t in GOD's Salvation. No; the poor Sinner mu&s;t fir&s;t be deeply &s;en&s;ible of his own mi&s;erable &s;tate by Nature, and &s;ee the ab&s;olute need he &s;tands in of Eternal Life; and &s;o with fear and trem|bling inquire and &s;eek in earne&s;t after this Salvation. And when the Sinner is once come to this, we have all the rea&s;on in the World, to hope, it won't be long, before GOD will di&s;co|ver to the mi&s;erable Creature, where his Help is to be found. Now this may &s;erve to convince us all of the great Ne|ce&s;&s;ity and Importance of being chiefly concerned about Eternal Salvation; and &s;o of inquiring after it, as the One Thing needful. For I &s;uppo&s;e there is &s;carce any Sinner under the Go&s;pel to blind and &s;tupid in his &s;ins, but, in his cooler Thoughts, thinks, Eternal Life to be real|ly nece&s;&s;ary for him; and hopes to come to the Enjoyment of it at la&s;t. But here|in lies the mi&s;ery and deceit of the gene|rality of carnal Sinners. They think their Salvation may be obtain'd at an ea&s;y rate, at any time: and that they have no
<PB N="43" REF="003231_0048_0FF0253F9546ABA8">
need to make it the main Inquiry and Bu&s;ine&s;s of their Lives; and &s;o go on &s;e|curely in their Sins, till the Day of Grace and Sea&s;on of Salvation is over with them for ever. But, believe it Sinner, you mu&s;t be made deeply &s;en&s;ible of the pre&s;ent need you &s;tand in of Salvation, and in|quire and &s;eek after it, with as great Con|cern of Soul, as ever you &s;ought after any one thing in the World. And by this means, you'l &s;oon come into a fair way to have the mo&s;t important Inquiry an&s;|wered to the &s;atisfaction and comfort of your Soul.</P>
<P>AND thus you &s;ee, in the&s;e Particulars, of how great Nece&s;&s;ity and Importance it is, that every Sinner &s;hould make the Inquiry after Salvation his fir&s;t and great Inquiry. And this was the Third general Head, I propo&s;ed to &s;peak to, under the Doctrine. I &s;hall therefore clo&s;e this Di&s;cour&s;e with a Reflection or two on what has been &s;aid.</P>
<P>USE. I. DOES the Salvation of a Sinner imply &s;uch Things as we have heard in it? Oh, How &s;tupid and blind then are &s;uch poor Sinners who have little or no concern about this Salvation! Poor Souls! you &s;ee not the mi&s;erable Condi|tion

you are in by Nature. You are upon the very brink of Eternal Ruine: There is but one &s;hort &s;tep between you and eternal De&s;truction; and yet you can eat, and drink, and &s;leep, and enjoy your &s;elves, with as much ea&s;e and &s;atisfaction as if you were out of all Danger. And tho' you &s;tand in as much need of this Salvation, as ever any poor Souls did, or can do: yet, you &s;light and de&s;pi&s;e it, and mind the mere&s;t Trifles in the World, more than you do the great Concerns of your precious Souls and Eternity. Oh! the amazing &s;tupidity, the blindne&s;s, and the hardne&s;s of your Hearts! You have no pity or concern for your &s;elves. But alas! your Mini&s;ters and Chri&s;tian Neigh|bours, they pity and pray for you: their Hearts tremble for fear of what is coming upon you. And Oh! that the infinite GOD would have pity upon you, for the &s;ake of the great Redeemer, and pluck you as brands out of the Burning!</P>
<P>USE. II. HENCE learn that Con|vinced Sinners, in being &s;o earne&s;t in their Inquiry after this Salvation, have all the Rea&s;on in the World on their &s;ide; and do that which is well-plea&s;ing in the &s;ight of GOD. And therefore poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Souls! tho' you may po&s;&s;ibly

<P N="1">1. YOU mu&s;t carefully watch &amp; guard again&s;t <HI>Sin,</HI> if ever you intend to be &s;aved. Sin is the wor&s;t and mo&s;t dangerous Ene|my we have to conflict withal, and &s;tands more immediately, than any other, in the way of our Salvation. It was this that at fir&s;t brought us into &s;o wretched and mi&s;erable a Condition as to need Salvati|on. 'Twas this that violated the holy Law of GOD, and expo&s;ed us to the dreadful Wrath and Cur&s;e of GOD, which we now lie open to by Nature. And 'tis this that at pre&s;ent &s;tands between the Sinner, and the Salvation of his Soul. And therefore, were it not for this, the other Enemies of our Salvation, cou'd do little or no hurt to us, in the great Con|cern we have in hand. But, Sinner, this being an Enemy <HI>within thy &s;elf,</HI> it is in league with all the other Adver&s;aries <HI>with|out,</HI> and opens the pa&s;&s;age for their more ea&s;y and &s;ucce&s;sful A&s;&s;ault upon thee. And therefore your main Concern, upon this head, &s;hould be, How to watch and guard, and &s;ecure your &s;elf effectually a|gain&s;t Sin. And to this end, you mu&s;t
<PB N="50" REF="003231_0055_0FF025536959E060">
get as well acquainted as you can with your own Heart; and here you will &s;oon di&s;cover the bitter Root and Spring of all Sin. For as the Prophet ob&s;erves, Jer. 17.9. <HI>The heart is deceitful above all things, and de&s;perately wicked.</HI> Yea, 'tis full of the mo&s;t unnatural Enmity again&s;t GOD and his holy Law. Rom. 8.7. <HI>The car|nal mind is enmity again&s;t God; it is not &s;ubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</HI> And therefore the corrupt Heart is the Fountain of all tho&s;e actual Sins which pollute our Thoughts, Lips, and Lives, Math. 15.19. <HI>Out of the heart pro|ceed evil tho'ts, murders, adulteries &amp;c. which defile the man.</HI> You mu&s;t therefore en|deavour to &s;ee &amp; lay to heart the &s;trength and treachery of Sin, that dwells in you; and cry out under the burden of it, as he did, Rom. 7.24. <HI>Oh, wretched man, that I am, who &s;hall deliver me from the body of this death?</HI> And with this &s;en&s;e of indwelling Sin, you mu&s;t earne&s;tly apply to the Blood of Je&s;us to clean&s;e you from the Guilt and Pollution of <HI>this,</HI> and all your actual Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; and you mu&s;t carry the Body of Sin to the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, and plead importunately that it may be Crucified and Slain there and that by the help of GOD's HOLY SPIRIT you may from this time forward
<PB N="51" REF="003231_0056_0FF02556B9F0BF98">
be deliver'd from the Reign and Tyran|ny of it. And when you have taken this method to mortify and &s;ubdue the Root and Fountain of Sin in you, then careful|ly watch again&s;t all the <HI>workings</HI> of Sin in your Heart, and the <HI>out-breakings</HI> of it, in your Life and Conver&s;ation. <HI>Keep thy heart with all diligence,</HI> and endea|vour to &s;uppre&s;s the very fir&s;t motions to Sin in it. And whatever particular Lu&s;ts you have been more peculiarly inclined to, and that have been as <HI>a Right Hand,</HI> or <HI>a Right Eye,</HI> &s;et your &s;elf in a &s;pecial manner again&s;t &s;uch Lu&s;ts; and Pray and Watch, and &s;trive hard for the Mortifica|tion and De&s;truction of them. And in a word, &s;ee that you con&s;tantly Watch and Pray again&s;t all Sin, and all Temptations to Sin. So we are directed to do, in Mat. 26.41. <HI>Watch and Pray that ye enter not into Temptation.</HI> Thus you mu&s;t care|fully guard and &s;trive again&s;t all Sin, if you really intend and de&s;ire to be &s;aved. And I pray, you would ob&s;erve all that I have &s;aid here concerning Sin, and com|ply with the whole Direction. For ma|ny an Awakened Sinner, for want of due Conformity to this Rule, has at la&s;t fallen &s;hort of Eternal Salvation. For &s;ome Sin|ners when they have been under the Con|victions of the HOLY SPIRIT, and in
<PB N="52" REF="003231_0057_0FF0255A22039C70">
great Concern about the &s;tate of their Souls, and another World, have been full of terrour on the account of &s;ome <HI>Hei|nous</HI> and <HI>Scandalous</HI> Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions they have been guilty of; and have taken a great deal of pains to reform them&s;elves in &s;uch Particulars. And when they tho't they had done this, they concluded now they had done all that was nece&s;&s;ary with re&s;pect to Sin; without ever coming to &s;ee the Mon&s;trous Vilene&s;s and Wicked|ne&s;s of their own Hearts: and &s;o have liv|ed all their Days, and Dyed at la&s;t under the Reigning Power and Guilt of In|dwelling Sin. This &s;eems to have been a fatal mi&s;take in the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari|&s;ees</HI> of Old. And then again, many o|thers, when they have been in the like concern for Salvation, have confe&s;&s;ed be|fore God, the Guilt, both of Original and Actual Sins, and begg'd of him the Par|don of both; and with their Confe&s;&s;ions have reform'd a great deal that has been ami&s;s in them: but then, they have had &s;ome &s;ecret Re&s;erves, &s;ome beloved Lu&s;ts, that they cou'd never be prevail'd upon to part withal: and &s;o they have finally fallen &s;hort of Eternal Life. A &s;ad In|&s;tance of this kind we have in that Young Man, who came to Chri&s;t, with that im|portant Que&s;tion, Math. 19.16. <HI>Ma&s;ter,
<PB N="53" REF="003231_0058_0FF0255CB1155E60">
what good thing &s;hall I do, that I may in|herit eternal life?</HI> He appears, by this In|quiry, to have been in &s;ome con&s;iderable Concern about his Salvation; and was willing to <HI>do,</HI> and <HI>had done,</HI> a great ma|ny things for the &s;ake of it; but he cou'd not part with his <HI>Coveteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> for the &s;ake of Heaven; and &s;o fell &s;hort of Eternal Life at la&s;t; as appears from that <HI>Context.</HI> And therefore, as I &s;aid before, if ever you intend to be &s;aved, you mu&s;t &s;et your &s;elf again&s;t all and every Sin: again&s;t Ori|ginal and Actual Sins; again&s;t the Sins of Heart, Lip, and Life &amp;c. And if you can but get the victory over Sin, you'l remove the main ob&s;tacle in the way to your Eternal Salvation. Again,</P>
<P N="2">2. As you mu&s;t carefully watch and guard again&s;t Sin; &s;o you mu&s;t, with the like care, watch and guard again&s;t <HI>Self,</HI> if ever you intend to be &s;aved. This is another <HI>inbred Enemy,</HI> and inveterately &s;et again&s;t the Salvation of our Souls, in the way and method which the Go&s;pel pre&s;cribes. I confe&s;s, indeed, every Sin|ner has a principle of <HI>&s;elf-love,</HI> whereby he truly de&s;ires his own Happine&s;s, both in this World, and in that which is to come. But then, he has an accur&s;ed principle of <HI>Pride</HI> in him, whereby he can't bear to think of going intirely out of him&s;elf to
<PB N="54" REF="003231_0059_0FF02560F4E67330">
another, for that Salvation he &s;tands in need of. And therefore many a poor Sinner, when he has been greatly Awa|kened by the Spirit of GOD, and bro't into deep Concern about the &s;tate of his precious Soul, has been willing to do a great many things in Religion; yea, every thing which he tho't was required of him in the Law of God: and hence he has &s;et him&s;elf, with a great deal of Care and Diligence, to re|form all known Evils, and to Di&s;charge every known Duty. And, indeed, it is a great length which many an Awakened Sinner has gone in this way. And it would grieve any one to the Heart to think, that after &s;o much Labour and Co&s;t in Religion; &s;o much &s;triving again&s;t Sin, and unto Duty; after &s;o many Prayers and Tears and Struggles, again&s;t many of the Enemies of our Salvation; and after an incredible deal of pains taken to ob|tain Eternal Life, the poor Sinner &s;hould in the End fall &s;hort of Heaven and Hap|pine&s;s. But &s;o it has been with a multi|tude in the Chri&s;tian World; and, I doubt, will be &s;o with a great many more. For tho' they are willing to go all this length in Religion; yet, they can't be per&s;wad|ed to go one &s;tep further, i.e. to go out of them&s;elves to CHRIST, and re&s;t upon Him alone for Salvation, which would
<PB N="55" REF="003231_0060_0FF0256283ADBDF0">
effectually &s;ecure their Eternal Well-being. But their own Obedience mu&s;t be the price of their Future Happine&s;s. They are righteous in their own eyes: and think there is &s;omething worthy of God's acceptance in their own Per&s;ons and Performances; and will not be per|&s;waded that GOD can, with any Ju&s;tice, ca&s;t them off at la&s;t, when they have done and &s;uffered &s;o much in his Cau&s;e and Service. This &s;eems to have been the fundamental error of the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pha|ri&s;ees</HI> in the days of our Saviour: and therefore they are frequently condemned by him for their <HI>&s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and threatned with eternal Damnation, after all their fair &s;how in Religion. And in|deed the generality of the more religious <HI>Jews</HI> &s;plit upon this Rock, in the days of our Saviour and his Apo&s;tles. See Rom. 10.3. &mdash; <HI>For they being ignorant of God's righteou&s;ne&s;s (&s;ays the Apo&s;tle) and going about to e&s;tabli&s;h their own righteou&s;ne&s;s, have not &s;ubmitted them&s;elves unto the Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of God.</HI> And &s;o fell &s;hort <HI>of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of faith,</HI> i. e. of Eternal Sal|vation; as we find in the clo&s;e of the preceeding Chapter. And therefore, if ever you intend to be &s;aved, you mu&s;t di|ligently watch and guard again&s;t this Self-righteous Principle: and be not on|ly
<PB N="56" REF="003231_0061_0FF025659753C958">
willing to do all you can in Obedience to the Law of GOD; but when you have done all, you mu&s;t be willing to confe&s;s you are but an unprofitable Servant; and ca&s;t your &s;elf upon the free Grace and Mercy of GOD, and tru&s;t alone to the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the LORD JESUS CHRIST, for Ju&s;tification to Eternal Life. This (as I &s;aid before) is what eve|ry Sinner is very hardly brought to, thro' the reigning Pride of his own heart: and therefore there is &s;o much the greater hazard, from this Quarter, of your falling &s;hort of the Grace of GOD at la&s;t. Well then, let me advi&s;e, and prevail with every Awakened Sinner, that is now inquiring in earne&s;t, What he mu&s;t do to be &s;aved, to take &s;pecial heed of <HI>Self:</HI> That is, of tru&s;ting in your own Duties and Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, for the Salvation you are &s;eeking after. And to this purpo&s;e, Let me far|ther advi&s;e and entreat you, to think &s;e|riou&s;ly with your &s;elf, That you have a GOD of infinite <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> as well as a GOD of infinite Mercy, to deal withal: And that the &s;trict Ju&s;tice of GOD requires perfect Obedience to every <HI>Tittle</HI> and <HI>Iota</HI> of the Law, before any Per&s;on can be ju&s;tified by the Deeds of it; and by con&s;equence, that full Satis|faction mu&s;t be made for the Sinner's
<PB N="57" REF="003231_0062_0FF025681BA39F60">
breach of the Law, before he can be ac|quitted from the condemning Sentence of it. <HI>Again,</HI> Con&s;ider, what a vile Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or you have been: what Sin and Guilt you brought into the World with you; and how many thou&s;ands of actual Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions may be ju&s;tly charg|ed to your own Account. Think <HI>al&s;o,</HI> how far &s;hort you fall of the &s;trict De|mands of the holy Law of GOD; even when you have done your be&s;t in Obedi|ence to it: Think how many Duties you have totally neglected; and how defec|tive you have been in the <HI>manner</HI> of tho&s;e Duties you have be&s;t attended: what wrong <HI>Ends</HI> you have many times had in them, and what &s;inful <HI>wandrings</HI> and <HI>di&s;tractions;</HI> what <HI>coldne&s;s, deadne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>formality</HI> in the Performance of them. And <HI>then</HI> think, whether a Righteou&s;ne&s;s made up of &s;uch lame and imperfect Ser|vices can have any thing of real worth or merit in it: whether GOD can be be|holden to the Sinner on the account of them; or, whether he may not ju&s;tly con|demn him, after all he has done, or can do, of this Nature: nay, whether He is not in Ju&s;tice bound to do &s;o, if the Sin|ner have no other Righteou&s;ne&s;s than this maimed Righteou&s;ne&s;s of his own, to tru&s;t unto. If you do but clo&s;ely pur&s;ue &s;uch
<PB N="58" REF="003231_0063_0FF0256C38A10648">
Meditations as the&s;e, it will, by the Grace of GOD, quickly bring you to confe&s;s with tho&s;e, in I&s;a. 64.6. <HI>We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteou&s;ne&s;|&s;es are as filthy rags.</HI> And &s;o make you afraid to tru&s;t to any Righteou&s;ne&s;s of your own; yea, wholly to renounce it in the great Affair of your Souls Salvation. And if you can but once come truly and thoroughly to conquer and renounce Self in this great Affair, you'l then get over one of the main Hindrances to the Salvati|on of your Soul. And now I proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="3">3. YOU mu&s;t carefully watch and guard again&s;t <HI>Satan,</HI> if you intend to be &s;aved. Indeed <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Self</HI> are the two mo&s;t hazardous Enemies of our Eternal Salva|tion; becau&s;e they have their Seat and Re&s;idence in us, and have wrought them|&s;elves, as it were, even into the very Con|&s;titution of Man, in his fallen &s;tate; and &s;o are pre&s;ent with us at all times, and in all places; and oppo&s;e every thing that tends to the Honour of GOD, and the Salvation of our Souls. But then <HI>Sa|tan</HI> and this <HI>Evil World</HI> are as inveterate Enemies to us as Sin and Self. And be|cau&s;e they are in &s;trict League with the Enemies within, they have all the Ad|vantage, they can wi&s;h for to make the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful a&s;&s;aults upon us; and we
<PB N="59" REF="003231_0064_0FF0256FB28818A0">
are daily in infinite hazard of being ruin|ed Eternally by them. And therefore if you mean to be &s;aved in the World to come, you mu&s;t be careful and diligent in your Watch and Guard again&s;t them. But 'tis the fir&s;t of the&s;e I am to &s;peak to under this Head. And here I &s;hall ob&s;erve, That <HI>Satan</HI> is a mo&s;t Inveterate &amp; Dan|gerous Enemy. He is full of the mo&s;t Implacable Hatred, Rage, and Malice a|gain&s;t the Ble&s;&s;ed God: and has been &s;o ever &s;ince his Apo&s;tacy, and Bani&s;hment out of Heaven. And in con&s;equence of this, he has all along been carrying on a War again&s;t GOD, and doing all he can to Rob Him of the Glory that is due to His Name. And as he hates the Infinite GOD; &s;o he hates every One that is in Favour with GOD, and envies the Happine&s;s of their &s;tate. This mov'd him to a&s;&s;ault our fir&s;t Parents in their primitive &s;tate of Innocency; which proved &s;o fatal to them, and to all their Po&s;terity, as we find in <HI>the Third Chapter of Gene&s;is.</HI> And when GOD, to &s;hew forth the Infinite Riches of His Sovereign Grace, had con|triv'd and revealed the a&s;toni&s;hing Me|thod of our Redemption, by the <HI>promi&s;ed Seed,</HI> as we find in <HI>the</HI> 15th <HI>ver&s;e of that Chapter,</HI> this filled him &s;till with greater Rage and Hatred again&s;t GOD, and Man|kind,
<PB N="60" REF="003231_0065_0FF0257233053FB0">
whom, by his Subtilty, he had drawn into the grand Rebellion again&s;t GOD. And he has ever &s;ince imploy'd his ut|mo&s;t Strength and Policy, to overthrow the method of our Redemption, and to keep poor Souls from enjoying that Sal|vation, which Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed for them. And therefore we read, in 1 Pet. 5.8. &mdash; <HI>Your adver&s;ary the Devil, as a roaring Lyon, walketh about &s;eeking whom he may devour.</HI> And accordingly, we are in the utmo&s;t Hazard of being ruin'd for|ever by this mo&s;t malicious Adver&s;ary. For he is implacably &s;et again&s;t us, and bent upon our Eternal De&s;truction. And then be&s;ides, being of the <HI>Angelic</HI> Order, he is furni&s;hed with Powers va&s;tly Supe|riour to Man, at his fir&s;t Creation; and greatly exceeds us in Natural Strength, and in his Policy, which has been much improved by long experience, in contriv|ing and making u&s;e of &s;uch &s;nares and &s;tratagems, as have the greate&s;t tendency to deceive and ruine poor Souls forever And more than all this, he has u&s;urpt at Empire over Mankind in their Natural Condition; and Sinners are by Nature willing to &s;ubmit to his accur&s;ed Rule and Tyranny. And therefore he is call+ed, in Eph. 2.2. <HI>The prince of the power of the air, the &s;pirit that now worketh in
<PB N="61" REF="003231_0066_0FF02575A63B79C0">
the children of di&s;obedience.</HI> And many Millions of poor Souls daily run after him in the broad way to Eternal De&s;truction: All which may &s;erve to convince us of the infinite Hazard we are in of being undone to Eternity by the malicious Powers of Darkne&s;s. And therefore every poor Sinner that de&s;ires and expects to be &s;av|ed, mu&s;t &s;tand upon his watch and guard again&s;t the Devil, and his accur&s;ed Legions. And let him appear in ever &s;o beauteous a form, (as &s;ometimes he <HI>transforms him|&s;elf into an Angel of Light,</HI> and puts the faire&s;t Colours on the foule&s;t Deeds, yet) you mu&s;t renounce him, and all his works, and have nothing to do with the unfruit|ful works of darkne&s;s: for if you al|low your &s;elf in any of them, they'l be the <HI>bane</HI> of your Soul forever. Yea, you mu&s;t watch again&s;t his Snares and Temp|tations of all kind. You mu&s;t enquire into the Nature and Tendency of them, <HI>and not be ignorant of his Devices, le&s;t he get an advantage of you.</HI> See 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.11. And here I &s;hall take liberty to warn you again&s;t two of his mo&s;t Subtil and Comprehen&s;ive Devices, whereby he has ruined many Millions of poor Souls. And the&s;e are <HI>carnal Security</HI> on the one hand, and our <HI>horrid De&s;pair</HI> of the Mercy of GOD on the other hand.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="62" REF="003231_0067_0FF02578E95275F0">(1.) YOU mu&s;t watch and guard again&s;t <HI>carnal Security:</HI> again&s;t a tho'tle&s;s un|concerned frame of Spirit, about the &s;tate of your Soul, and another World. This is one of the mo&s;t fatal Devices of Satan, whereby he has ruined the greate&s;t part of Mankind already. He has led them on blindfold in the way to Eternal De|&s;truction; without any &s;ight of their Sin and Mi&s;ery; without any &s;en&s;e of their Danger; and without any remarkable Concern about the World to come, till they have &s;uddenly and unexpectedly been thru&s;t headlong into Eternal Perdi|tion. And when any poor Souls are a|wakened by the Spirit of GOD and bro't into concern about their Spiritual &s;tate, (as the Sinners I am now &s;peaking to, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be in) the Devil does all he can to &s;tifle the Convictions they are under, and to bring them back again into their for|mer &s;tate of &s;ecurity. And thus if the convinced Sinner be Young and in Health, he'll tell him, 'Tis time eno' yet to pre|pare for Eternity; and &s;o tempt him to lay a&s;ide this concern for the pre&s;ent. If he be &s;till tho'tful about his Eternal &s;tate, he'll feed him up with tho'ts of the Mer|cy of GOD, and tempt him to think 'tis an ea&s;y thing to be &s;aved; and &s;o lead him, if he can, unto a vain pre&s;umption of
<PB N="63" REF="003231_0068_0FF0257A7238B468">
the Mercy of GOD, without doing any thing con&s;iderable in Religion. And when this will not do, but the Sinner &s;ees &s;till he mu&s;t labour and &s;trive in Religi|on, if he intends to be &s;aved, and &s;o &s;ets about the Duties of it with &s;eeming ear|ne&s;tne&s;s and diligence. Then the Devil tempts him to place his Duties in the room of Chri&s;t, and to patch up a Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of his own, and tru&s;t to this for his Ju&s;tification to Eternal Life. And by the&s;e means he has deceived many an a|wakened Sinner, and lull'd him into his former carnal &s;ecurity, or into a vain confi|dence which has prov'd his Eternal ruine. And therefore you that are now Awaken|ed and Convinced by the Spirit of GOD, mu&s;t expect to meet with &s;uch Tempta|tions as the&s;e: and you mu&s;t carefully watch, and pray, and guard again&s;t them, or the Devil will certainly be too hard for you, and deceive &amp; undo you forever.</P>
<P>And then again,</P>
<P N="2">(2.) YOU mu&s;t watch and guard again&s;t <HI>horrid De&s;pair</HI> of the Mercy of GOD in CHRIST. This is another accur&s;ed Device and Snare of the Devil, whereby many an awakened Sinner has been ruined forever. For when the Adver&s;ary &s;ees, that, by all his Strength and Subtilty, he can't reduce
<PB N="64" REF="003231_0069_0FF0257DE301CAC0">
the poor Soul to its former &s;tate of Car|nal Security, then he &s;hifts the Scene, and &s;trives with all his might to drive the Sin|ner into utter De&s;pair of the Mercy of GOD. He &s;hoots his fiery Darts into the Soul, and fills the mind with bla&s;phemous and unrea&s;onable tho'ts of GOD: as tho' GOD was an hard Ma&s;ter; and as if the terms of Salvation, as they are laid down in the Go&s;pel, were &s;uch, that 'twas im|po&s;&s;ible for him ever to come up to them; yea, the Devil repre&s;ents GOD to the poor Sinner, as an irreconcileable Ene|my and Judge, as one re&s;olved upon his Eternal ruine: as one that will have no Mercy upon him, let him take ever &s;o much pains, in any way, to make his Peace with GOD. And by the force of &s;uch Temptations many an awakened Sinner has, with <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Judas,</HI> fallen into the mo&s;t Black and Outrageous De&s;pair of Mercy, and in the height of this De&s;pair, has with an Heart full of Enmity again&s;t GOD and CHRIST, and his Mouth full of Bla&s;phemy again&s;t them, ru&s;hed headlong into Eternal Perdition. And therefore let every Convinced Sinner, when he finds his Convictions grow and pre&s;s hard upon him, watch and pray again&s;t this ac|cur&s;ed Device of Satan; this horrid De&s;|pair of the Mercy of GOD. And labour

Indeed, this World and the things of it, as they came out of the hands of GOD were <HI>very good.</HI> See <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.31. And GOD particularly created them for the u&s;e and comfort of Mankind. And therefore, if
<PB N="66" REF="003231_0071_0FF02582AE9B3E70">
we had never &s;inned again&s;t GOD, we had never been in the lea&s;t hazard of any in|jury from our enjoyment of this World. But by our Apo&s;tacy from GOD, and as a puni&s;hment to Man for the &s;ame, the Cur&s;e of GOD has fallen upon this whole lower World; whereby 'tis full of Snares and Temptations on every &s;ide: And has been a &s;ad means to ruine many Millions of poor Souls forever and ever. And there|fore it it expre&s;ly called <HI>this pre&s;ent evil world.</HI> (<HI>Gal.</HI> 1.4.) And Satan is called <HI>the God of it</HI> (2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.4.) and his Evil Angels are called, <HI>the rulers of the dark|ne&s;s of this world, (Eph.</HI> 6.12.) And ac|cordingly, this World is now one of the greate&s;t Hindrances to the Salvation of our precious Souls. And <HI>Satan</HI> has, pro|bably, ruined more by the Snares and Enchantments of it, than by all his other Devices put together. And therefore we have many &s;olemn Warnings in the Word of GOD again&s;t the Snares and Temp|tations of this Evil World. We are warn|ed again&s;t all <HI>inordinate Love</HI> to the World and the things of it, and are told that a prevailing Love to them is utterly incon|&s;i&s;tent with the Love of God, and &s;o will certainly prove the De&s;truction of our Souls forever. 1 Joh. 2.15. <HI>Love not the world, neither the things that are in
<PB N="67" REF="003231_0072_0FF0258550349710">
the world: If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</HI> Again, we are as &s;olemnly warn'd again&s;t all Conformity to the &s;inful Manners and cu&s;toms of this World, as having a mo&s;t fatal tendency in them. Rom. 12 22. <HI>And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind,</HI> &amp;c. And then be&s;ides, Chri&s;t is &s;aid to <HI>have given him&s;elf for our Sins, that he might deliver us from this pre&s;ent evil world, according to the will of God and our Father.</HI> See the forecited <HI>Gal.</HI> 1.4. By the&s;e, and many other places of the &s;ame importance, it evidently appears this World is one of the greate&s;t Hindrances that can be to the Salvation of our im|mortal Souls. And therefore if you have any true de&s;ires after Eternal Life, and are willing to do all that is needful to be done, that &s;o you may be &s;aved forever, you mu&s;t &amp; will look upon this Evil World as an Enemy in the way to Heaven: and you mu&s;t diligently watch and pray a|gain&s;t all the Evils, Snares, Temptations, and Hazards of it. And in particular, you mu&s;t thus watch and pray again&s;t the <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Things</HI> of this Evil World.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) YOU mu&s;t watch and pray, that you be not ruin'd by the <HI>Men</HI> of this Evil

and Sinful World. It is &s;ad, indeed, to think that any of our own Fle&s;h &amp; Blood; that any of the &s;ame Frame and make we are of, and who &s;tand in need of the &s;ame Salvation that we do, &s;hould be &s;o vain and fooli&s;h, as to neglect their own Spi|ritual good, and be an hindrance to all about them in the way to Eternal Life. But &s;o it has always been, from the be|ginning of the World, to this day; and e|ver will be &s;o 'till <HI>the Wickedne&s;s of the Wicked &s;hall come to an end;</HI> which we may not expect 'till the Conclu&s;ion of time. And therefore, as you de&s;ire to be &s;aved in the day of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, you mu&s;t arm your &s;elves again&s;t the Men of this World, and have as little to do with them as you can. Indeed, it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible for us in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, to keep entirely at a di&s;tance from the Company and Conver&s;ation of the Men of this World; for we have oft times &s;omething or other nece&s;&s;arily to do with them, in the way of our lawful Calling. And he that would avoid this, as the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, in 1 Cor. 5.10. <HI>mu&s;t needs go out of the world.</HI> And therefore that which I intend here, is this, if you truly de&s;ire the Salvation of your precious Souls, you mu&s;t not chu&s;e &s;uch as are known to be Wicked Per&s;ons, for your
<PB N="69" REF="003231_0074_0FF0258BE2286668">
intimate Companions: you mu&s;t not take delight in their Evil Conver&s;ation: you mu&s;t not hearken to their Wicked Coun|&s;els; nor follow the bad Examples they &s;et before the World. For the&s;e things are &s;trictly forbidden to you in the Word of GOD. Prov. 1.10, 15. <HI>My Son, if Sinners entice thee, con&s;ent thou not. Walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path.</HI> And again, Chap. 4.14, 15. <HI>Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men. Avoid it, pa&s;s not by it, turn from it, and pa&s;s away.</HI> And if you will not hearken to the&s;e &s;olemn Admoniti|ons, you are threatned with eternal De|&s;truction, Prov. 13.20. <HI>A companion of fools &s;hall be de&s;troyed.</HI> And we find this awful threatning fulfilled in many &s;ad in&s;tances in the Word of GOD. And how many have we known or heard of in our day, who when they came to lie upon a <HI>Sick-bed,</HI> and a <HI>Death-bed,</HI> and &s;aw them&s;elves ju&s;t going into Eternity, then to cry out in the agony of their Souls, Oh! I am undone to Eternity! my evil Company which I have kept, and de|lighted in, has been the ruine of my poor Soul for ever! my wicked Companions have drawn away my Heart from GOD and Duty: They have been a means to

&s;tifle the Convictions of GOD's SPIRIT in me: and a means to draw me into all manner of Iniquity. And behold, now I mu&s;t be &s;eparated from them for a little while, and be thru&s;t down into Hell, in|to the doleful Company of Devils and Damned Spirits, there to endure the dreadful Wrath of GOD to all Eternity. Oh, Cur&s;ed be their Per&s;ons; Cur&s;ed be their Advice to me; and Cur&s;ed the Day that ever I &s;aw the Face of any one of them. This has been the Heart-pier|cing Language of many a vain Company-keeper, as he has pa&s;t out of this World into an amazing Eternity: And therefore, as you would e&s;cape the dreadful Doom of the&s;e Sinners, and be prepared for the <HI>Comforts</HI> of a dying Hour, and the Happi|ne&s;s of the future State; avoid the evil Com|pany and Conver&s;ation of the Men of the World; and &s;ee that you be able to &s;ay with <HI>David,</HI> in P&s;al. 26.4, 5. <HI>I have not &s;at with vain per&s;ons, neither will I go in with di&s;&s;emblers. I have hated the congregation of evil doers: and will not &s;it with the wicked.</HI> And this will have a good tendency to prepare you for the Mercy of GOD. For &s;uch are pronoun|ced ble&s;&s;ed, in P&s;al. 1.1. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is the man that walketh not in the coun&s;el of the ungodly, nor &s;tandeth in the way of &s;in|ners,

<P>And then,</P>
<P N="2">(2.) YOU mu&s;t with the like Diligence watch, and pray, and guard again&s;t the <HI>Things of this Evil World,</HI> if you intend to be &s;aved. By the&s;e things, I mean the Riches, Honours, and Plea&s;ures of this Life. For tho' they are not &s;imply &s;inful in them&s;elves; yet, when Men &s;et their Hearts and Affections inordi|nately upon them, they prove a dreadful Snare and Temptation to them; and ma|ny thou&s;ands and millions have been e|ternally undone by them. And therefore you mu&s;t mortify all inordinate affection to the&s;e things, or they'l be the Ruine of you forever. Particularly, (1.) You mu&s;t guard again&s;t all inordinate affection to the <HI>Riches</HI> of this Life, and get this corrupt Affection mortified in you. For, this is that <HI>Lu&s;t of the Eyes</HI> which we are warn'd again&s;t, in 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 2.16. And which has been the eternal undoing of many a precious Soul. For as the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, in 1 Tim. 6.9, 10. <HI>They that will be rich, fall into temptation and a &s;nare, and into many fooli&s;h and hurt+ful lu&s;ts, which drown men in de&s;truction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil, which while &s;ome have co|veted after, they have erred from the truth,
<PB N="72" REF="003231_0077_0FF02593EF599118">
and pierced them&s;elves through with many &s;orrows.</HI> The &s;um of which is, inordi|nate De&s;ires after the Riches of this World, have, tempted and prevailed upon many a poor Sinner to neglect the true Riches, for the &s;ake of them; and pu&s;h'd him on to many unwarrantable Practices for the gaining of them; &s;uch as Lying, Cheating, Stealing, and the like, which have involved him in a great deal of Guilt here, and cru&s;h'd him down into Eternal Perdition, in the other World. And thus they have proved a Snare to him, and his Ruine for ever. And therefore, if you would be &s;aved in the World to come, you mu&s;t carefully guard again&s;t this &s;nare of De&s;truction. You mu&s;t pray to GOD to &s;how you the <HI>vanity</HI> of Earthly Riches; and often think how uncertain they are. For as the <HI>wi&s;e man</HI> ob&s;erves, in Prov. 23.5. &mdash; <HI>Riches certainly make them&s;elves wings, they fly away as an eagle towards heaven.</HI> And therefore, when Men dote upon them, <HI>they &s;et their eyes upon that which is not.</HI> As you may &s;ee in this <HI>&s;ame ver&s;e;</HI> and the poor <HI>Mi&s;er</HI> enjoys little el&s;e in them, <HI>&s;aving the beholding of them with his eyes,</HI> Eccl. 5.11. Oh then, &s;ee that you don't neglect your poor Souls, and the Riches and Trea&s;ures of Grace and Glory, for
<PB N="73" REF="003231_0078_0FF0259576EF5EA8">
&s;uch Trifles, as the Riches of this World are at the be&s;t. Again, (2.) You mu&s;t guard again&s;t the empty <HI>Honours</HI> of this World, and learn to de&s;pi&s;e them. For, the&s;e are what the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> calls <HI>the Pride of Life,</HI> in the forecited 1 <HI>Epi&s;t.</HI> 2.16. Becau&s;e the generality of tho&s;e who arrive to them, are proud and vain-glorious: They en|tertain too high an opinion of them&s;elves, and too mean a conceit of the re&s;t of mankind. And they prove a mo&s;t dread|ful Snare and Temptation to Men, when they &s;et their Hearts and Affections inor|nately upon them: For then they neg|lect the Honour of GOD, and the Ho|nours of Religion, for the &s;ake of a lit|tle Worldly Glory: and if this can't be come at any other way, they are tempted to take the mo&s;t indirect and &s;inful Cour|&s;es, by fal&s;e Flatteries, by Bribery, and &s;ometimes by Blood-&s;hed, to obtain them. And thus while they are <HI>clambering</HI> af|ter the Honours of the World, their Souls are &s;inking, by this means into the very depths of Hell. And therefore, as you wi&s;h and long for the Salvation of your poor Souls, Oh! guard again&s;t this Snare of De&s;truction. Pray to GOD to &s;hew you how empty the Honours of the World are, and think how vain they be: That they depend only on the Breath of
<PB N="74" REF="003231_0079_0FF02597DD4E6160">
thy Fellow-creatures, and are more in Name than in Reality; and that a few days, at farthe&s;t, will put an end to the outward Glory of the greate&s;t Men on Earth. For we read, in P&s;al. 49.12. &mdash; <HI>Man being in honour abideth not.</HI> And in ver. 17. <HI>When he dieth he &s;hall carry no|thing away: his glory &s;hall not de&s;cend after him.</HI> And then (3.) la&s;tly, You mu&s;t carefully guard again&s;t the <HI>&s;inful Plea&s;ures</HI> of this Life, &amp; learn to contemn them. For, the&s;e are called, the <HI>Lu&s;t of the Fle&s;h,</HI> in 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 2.16. which I have named once &amp; again al|ready. And this (&s;ays one) is, <HI>&s;ubjectively,</HI> "the Humour and Appetite of indulging Fle&s;hly Plea&s;ure: and <HI>objectively,</HI> all tho&s;e things that excite and influence the Plea|&s;ures of the Fle&s;h". This Lu&s;t (&s;ays he) is u&s;ually called <HI>Luxury".</HI> And as the&s;e Plea&s;ures, when they are inordi|nately de&s;ired and pur&s;ued, are all of them <HI>&s;inful Plea&s;ures.</HI> (See <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.25.) So they have an immediate tendency to the Ruine of our Souls for ever. For while Sinners hunt after the Plea&s;ures of Sen&s;e, and immer&s;e them&s;elves in them, they can have no true De&s;ire after the Enjoyment of GOD, and the Plea&s;ures of Heaven; nor find any time to take care of their precious Souls, and provide for the World to come. And agreably

the Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> &s;peaking to the&s;e Sen|&s;uaili&s;ts, &s;ays in Chap. 5. ver. 5. <HI>Ye have lived in plea&s;ure on earth, and been wan|ton; ye have nouri&s;hed your heart as in a day of &s;laughter.</HI> And thereby they trea&s;ure up to them&s;elves Wrath again&s;t the Day of Wrath.

And therefore, poor Sinner, if you have any true de&s;ire after Eternal Salvation, and are willing to do all that is nece&s;&s;ary for this pur|po&s;e, you mu&s;t mortify your inordinate De&s;ires after the Plea&s;ures of Sen&s;e, and get your Heart weaned from them. And to this end, Think how momentany the&s;e Plea&s;ures are: they being but <HI>for a &s;ea&s;on,</HI> and a &s;hort &s;ea&s;on too. Think al&s;o how <HI>un|&s;atisfactory</HI> they are; how unable to fill the enlarged and boundle&s;s De&s;ires of your immortal Soul. And then beg of GOD, that He would reveal to you the true and &s;ub&s;tantial Plea&s;ures of Religion, and give you to ta&s;te of the Comforts of His Holy Spirit, which will make &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures the mo&s;t in&s;ipid and un&s;avoury things in the World to you.</P>
<P>AND thus I have fini&s;hed the fir&s;t ge|neral Head in an&s;wer to that grand In|quiry, <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI> namely, If you would be &s;aved you mu&s;t guard again&s;t all the Hindrances of your

<P>AND now to conclude at this time, Let me intreat every poor Sinner that is in deep Concern for the Salvation of his own Soul, to hearken to what I have &s;aid, and carefully Watch and Pray a|gain&s;t the&s;e <HI>Hindrances</HI> of Eternal Salva|tion.

<HEAD>SERMON IV.</HEAD>
<P>_I Am &s;till upon the An&s;wer to that grand Inquiry in the Text, <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be Saved?</HI> This An&s;wer I propo&s;ed to give you under the&s;e Three more general Heads. <HI>viz.</HI> (1.) If you intend to be &s;aved, you mu&s;t carefully watch and guard again&s;t all the Hindran|ces of a Sinners Salvation. (2.) You mu&s;t carefully and diligently attend all the Means and Helps of Salvation. And (3.) You mu&s;t particularly and directly clo&s;e in with Chri&s;t by Faith, that &s;o you may be &s;aved by Him alone. I have &s;poken largely already to the fir&s;t of the&s;e Heads. And proceed now to the next in order:</P>
<P>And this is,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> IF you intend or de&s;ire to be &s;aved, you mu&s;t carefully attend to, &amp; im|prove,
<PB N="78" REF="003231_0083_0FF025A196488B48">
all the <HI>Means</HI> and <HI>Helps</HI> of Salva|tion. It is not &s;ufficient that you only &s;teer clear of the Rocks; avoid the Dan|gers; and &s;urmount &s;uch Difficulties as lie in the way to Heaven, and have prov'd fatal to infinite numbers already: but you mu&s;t &s;et your Faces towards Hea|ven, and &s;teer your Cour&s;e, as directly as you can, in the way that leads to it. And this you mu&s;t do, by attending and improving aright all the <HI>Means</HI> and <HI>Helps</HI> of Eternal Life. And the&s;e I &s;hall con&s;ider either as In&s;tituted, or Occa&s;io|nal. By the <HI>In&s;tituted</HI> means of Salvati|on, I intend &s;uch, as GOD has appointed in his Word, and therein required us con&s;tantly to attend them in the working out our Salvation. And the&s;e are <HI>the &s;tated Ordinances</HI> of the Go&s;pel. By the <HI>Occa&s;ional</HI> Means and Helps of Sal|vation, I de&s;ign &s;uch <HI>Providences</HI> of GOD, which, in the Sovereignty of his Grace, He has frequently Ble&s;t for &s;aving good to the careful Ob&s;ervers of them.</P>
<P>Here then,</P>
<P N="1">1. IF you wou'd be &s;aved, you mu&s;t care|fully &amp; con&s;tantly attend all the <HI>In&s;tituted</HI> and <HI>Appointed Means</HI> of Salvation. Which, as I &s;aid before, are the ORDINANCES of the Go&s;pel; and more e&s;pecially the <HI>Word,
<PB N="79" REF="003231_0084_0FF025A320EF6968">
Prayer,</HI> and the <HI>Sacraments</HI> of the New-Te&s;tament. Some of the&s;e are the Out|ward and Ordinary Means, of Divine Ap|pointment, to <HI>beget</HI> Grace in the Hearts of Sinners; and all of them are &s;uch means for the <HI>growth</HI> and <HI>increa&s;e</HI> of Grace in the Children of GOD. And every one that de&s;ires to be &s;aved, mu&s;t make a right Improvement of them according as his State and Condition may be.</P>
<P>And therefore,</P>
<P N="1">1. IF you de&s;ire to get into a &s;tate of Grace, you mu&s;t give the mo&s;t Careful and Diligent Attendance to <HI>the Word of GOD.</HI> The Word of GOD is a &s;pecial Means of Divine Appointment for the Conver&s;ion and Salvation of peri&s;hing Sinners. And agreably we read, in P&s;al. 19.7, 8, <HI>The Law of the Lord is perfect converting the &s;oul: the Te&s;timony of the Lord is &s;ure, making wi&s;e the &s;imple &mdash; the Commandment of the Lord is pure, en|lightening the eyes.</HI> Indeed, the written Word of GOD is not &s;ufficient, of it &s;elf, to give Life unto a dead Soul. But how|ever it has a <HI>moral</HI> tendency to Salvation; as it di&s;covers to poor Sinners the mi&s;e|rable Condition they are in by Nature; the need they &s;tand in of Salvation; and points out to them the SAVIOUR of pe|ri&s;hing
<PB N="80" REF="003231_0085_0FF025A5B8E51810">
Souls: together with the Means and Method to obtain an Intere&s;t in Him. And then be&s;ides, the Word of GOD is the ordinary Means which the Holy Spirit makes u&s;e of and ble&s;&s;es for the opening a Sinners eyes, and turning him from Darkne&s;s to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto GOD. And therefore, the Word of GOD is a Means you mu&s;t carefully attend to, or you can never rea&s;onably hope to be &s;aved. And here, that you may improve the Word to your &s;aving Advantage,</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t look upon the written Word which we have in our Bibles, to be <HI>in|deed</HI> the Word of GOD; or that Reve|lation of his Mind and Will to us, which contains in it, all that he would have us to Believe, and Practi&s;e to Salvation.</P>
<P>AND accordingly, you mu&s;t u&s;e all the Helps we have to come to a right under|&s;tanding of the Mind and Will of GOD contained in his Sacred Word. To this end, you mu&s;t beg of GOD, as <HI>David</HI> did, in P&s;al. 119.18. <HI>Open thou mine eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.</HI> Pray to him that he would enable you to under&s;tand not on|ly the Letter, but the true Spirit and In|tent
<PB N="81" REF="003231_0086_0FF025AAC2512B90">
of his Holy Word. And with this Preparation, you mu&s;t Daily <HI>Read</HI> and <HI>Meditate</HI> in the Sacred Scriptures of Truth. You mu&s;t &s;et apart &s;ome time every Day to look into your Bible, and read a Portion in it. And whenever you do &s;o, you mu&s;t not content your &s;elf with a bare Cur&s;ory reading of a Chapter or two, but &s;pend a little time to exa|mine into the meaning of the Holy Gho&s;t, and meditate on the Mind and Will of GOD revealed in it, 'till you find your Hearts warmed and affected with it. And be&s;ides this &s;tated Reading the Scriptures; you mu&s;t make them the Man of your Coun&s;el at all times; and &s;earch into them particularly, that you may ob|tain that Light and Direction, which they afford in the great Concern of Eternal Salvation. Look into them, and &s;ee what they &s;ay, concerning the Mi&s;erable, un|done State the Sinner is in by Nature; how Obnoxious he is to the dreadful Wrath of GOD; how many Tremendous Cur&s;es &s;tand in their full Force again&s;t him, and mu&s;t certainly be Executed up|on him, if he lives and dyes in a &s;tate of Impenitency; and how unable the Sinner is &s;aid to be, to afford any Relief to him|&s;elf under the Ruines of the Apo&s;tacy. Look again into the Scriptures, and &s;ee
<PB N="82" REF="003231_0087_0FF025AD2510C8E8">
what Di&s;coveries they make of a Glori|ous Saviour for lo&s;t Sinners; what me|thod they pre&s;cribe, that we may obtain an Intere&s;t in him; and what gracious en|couragements are &s;et before us in the In|vitations and Promi&s;es of the Go&s;pel, to fly unto the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and put our Tru&s;t in him for Eternal Life. This &s;earching into the Scriptures is expre&s;ly required of us, in <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.39. And the Ble&s;&s;ed tendency of it is manife&s;t from P&s;al. 1.1, 2. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is the man &mdash;who&s;e delight is in the Law of the Lord, and in his Law doth he meditate day and night.</HI></P>

<P>AND here, I &s;hall take leave to add, as one &s;pecial means to under&s;tand the Will of GOD, and to receive farther light, in the great Affair of Eternal Sal|vation: 'Tis your Duty to go to the Mini&s;ters of CHRIST, who&s;e great Work and Bu&s;ine&s;s it is, to direct and a&s;&s;i&s;t your

And therefore, when you are in Darkne&s;s and Di&s;tre&s;s about your Spiritual &s;tate, and don't receive that Light and Encou|ragement from the Preached Word, which you are waiting and praying for; go to your Mini&s;ters; acquaint them with the &s;tate and circum&s;tances of your poor Souls. Don't be a&s;ham'd or afraid to do &s;o, as many have &s;infully been, le&s;t you betray your own Ignorance: but go, and give them to under&s;tand, as well as you can, what your &s;ad State and Fears are; and ask their Coun&s;els and Prayers for you. So did the poor <HI>Jay|lor</HI> in our <HI>Context.</HI> He &s;prang in, and came trembling, with an Heart full of Conviction and Di&s;tre&s;s, to <HI>Paul</HI> &amp; <HI>Silas,</HI> two <HI>eminent</HI> MINISTERS of JESUS CHRIST; and inquired particularly of them, <HI>what he mu&s;t do to be &s;aved?</HI> And GOD ble&s;t this method as a means for &s;aving good to him.

<P>AND when you have gain'd this Light and In&s;truction from the Word of GOD, you mu&s;t re&s;olve to make this WORD the RULE of your Faith, Wor&s;hip, and Man|ners, in the World.

<P N="2">2. IF you de&s;ire to get into a &s;tate of Grace, you mu&s;t be abundant <HI>in Prayer to GOD</HI> for this end. Prayer is a duty indi&s;pen&s;ably required of all Per&s;ons, both by the Light of Nature and Divine Re|velation. And it is an in&s;tituted Means for the Conver&s;ion and Salvation of mi&s;e|rable Sinners: And therefore the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> after he had plainly di&s;covered the hypocri&s;y of <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> and &s;o per|ceived that he was &s;till in the gall of bit|terne&s;s, and in the bond of iniquity, gives him this direction, in order to his Con|ver&s;ion, Act. 8.22. <HI>Repent of this thy wickedne&s;s, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</HI> For tho', 'tis very evident, there can be no real vertue in the Prayers of an unrege|nerate Sinner; yet GOD delights to ho|nour his own In&s;titution, and has many a time be&s;towed &s;aving Grace upon a poor Sinner, when he has, in agony of Soul, from an apprehen&s;ion of his mi&s;erable &s;tate by Nature, cry'd to him for his Mercy. And 'tis one of the mo&s;t hopeful <HI>Symtoms</HI>
<PB N="87" REF="003231_0092_0FF025B966E70F88">
that GOD intends to give Grace to a poor Sinner, when, by the Convictions of his Holy Spirit, he has brought the Sinner to Pray earne&s;tly to him. And therefore, as you who are now making that Inquiry in the Text, <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI> are in deep Concern about the &s;tate of your poor Souls, and wan't to be directed in the way to Heaven, I can &s;carce give you a more proper Direction thin this, <HI>Pray humbly to GOD, for the Salvation of your poor Souls.</HI> And that you may improve this Ordinance &s;o as to reap &s;aving Bene|fit by it:</P>
<P>SEE that you do in the fir&s;t place, hear|tily ble&s;s and prai&s;e GOD for what he has done for you already. That is, you mu&s;t ble&s;s GOD, that he has pre&s;erved your Soul in Life, and not &s;ent you down into Hell, as he might ju&s;tly have done, long before now. Adore his &s;overeign Grace and Patience towards you, in this re&s;pect, and give him the glory of them. Again, Ble&s;s GOD for the <HI>Po&s;&s;ibility</HI> there is of your Eternal Salvation, by his provid|ing &s;uch a glorious and almighty SAVI|OUR, for poor Sinners, as CHRIST is. And then again, Ble&s;s GOD for his di&s;tin|gui&s;hing Mercy in ordering your Birth and Being, not in a Land of <HI>Heatheni&s;h</HI> Darkne&s;s; but in a place where <HI>CHRIST

is revealed,</HI> and the <HI>Means</HI> of Grace and Salvation are, or may be enjoyed, in great Plenty, by all &s;orts of Sinners. And then, in a particular manner, Ble&s;s GOD for the &s;trivings of His Holy Spirit; and the gracious Effects of them: For the Con|victions and Awakenings you are under; and the deep Concern you are in at pre|&s;ent, about the &s;tate of your Soul and a|nother World. Indeed, the&s;e Convicti|ons when they ari&s;e to any con&s;iderable Degree, are very oppre&s;&s;ive and burden|&s;ome to Nature; and many an awaken|ed Sinner has look'd upon them only as the expre&s;&s;ions of GOD's Anger; and &s;o has been for &s;haking them off, as &s;oon as he could: But believe it, poor Soul, There is a great deal of Mercy in them. They come with a gracious de&s;ign to &s;how you the need you &s;tand in of a Chri&s;t, and put you upon flying to him in time, as your only &s;ure Refuge for Eternity. And therefore they are a &s;ufficient Ground for Prai&s;e. And you &s;hould in the mo&s;t &s;olemn and affectionate manner, ble&s;s and prai&s;e GOD, that he has not left you, as he has done thou&s;ands and millions of o|thers, to peri&s;h in a dead &s;leep of carnal &s;ecurity; but has in a great mea&s;ure, &s;hewn you your mi&s;ery by nature; and di&s;covered the wants of your poor Soul;

and put you upon &s;eeking after a remedy, if one may be found. And having thus ble&s;t GOD for what he has done for you already,</P>
<P>PRAY humbly and importunately to Him for what you &s;tand in need of. Oh, Beg of him, that, as he has begun to &s;hew Mercy to you, in the Convictions of his Spirit; &s;o that He would carry on this good Work, and cau&s;e his Convictions to take &s;uch deep root in your Heart, that they may never wear off; but abide in the mo&s;t lively Impre&s;&s;ions, till the gra|cious end of them is an&s;wered in a tho|rough Conver&s;ion to GOD.

Supplications to Him for Eternal Life; and u&s;e all the Arguments you can, in Prayer, to move his mo&s;t tender Com|pa&s;&s;ions towards you. Lay open the Wants and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of your poor Soul in the Duty. Lament the Mi&s;eries of your doleful &s;tate by Nature; and urge the Nece&s;&s;ity of Eternal Salvation: Tell him what an undone Wretch you &s;hall be forever; and how greatly you &s;hall di&s;honour Him to Eternity, unle&s;s he have Mercy on you. Declare to Him, what a De&s;ire you have after Eternal Life; and that you can't bear the thought of pe|ri&s;hing under the dreadful weight of his Eternal Wrath. Put Him al&s;o in mind of the great and glorious Provi&s;ion He has made by CHRIST, for the Salvation of &s;uch mi&s;erable Sinners as you are; and how great his Glory will be forever in your Salvation thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Again, Put Him in mind of the many gracious Invi|tations He has made to poor Sinners to come to Him in and through the Redee|mer, for Pardon and Salvation: Yea, urge this, that He has &s;olemnly Commanded you to do &s;o; and that 'tis in Obedience to his revealed Will, that you thus &s;eek to Him, for the Mercy you need. And in a Word, Humbly declare to Him, that it is the &s;tedfa&s;t Re&s;olution of your

Soul, to ca&s;t your &s;elf upon Him for his Grace in and thro' Chri&s;t; and that if you mu&s;t peri&s;h at la&s;t, you will peri&s;h at the feet of his Mercy. And while you are thus begging for the Mercy of GOD in Prayer: Oh, Give up, and de|vote your &s;elf to Him in the &s;ame Duty. Say, <HI>Lord, I am thine; for thou ha&s;t made me, and do&s;t daily pre&s;erve me; and ha&s;t paid down a price &s;ufficient for my Eter|nal Redemption: And accordingly I de&s;ire to be thine for ever; and do here upon my bended knees, pre&s;ent my &s;elf, Soul and Bo|dy to thee, a living Sacrifice: and devote all I have, to be employed in thy Service and for thy Glory: 'This, I acknowledge to be but my rea&s;onable Service: Oh, therefore, accept of me in the Son of thy Love; and &s;ave me for ever, according to the multitude of thy tender mercies in Him.</HI> Prayer thus improved can't but be very helpful to poor Sinners, in the great Concern of their Souls Salvation.</P>
<P>AND when you have thus improved the Word and Prayer; and GOD has Sancti|fyed them &s;o, that you begin to feel a mighty Change in you; and do now hate your Sins, and loath your &s;elf for them; and find the De&s;ires of your Soul drawn forth after Je&s;us Chri&s;t: and are
<PB N="92" REF="003231_0097_0FF025C77B195D30">
heartily willing to receive and embrace Him in all his Offices, and take your greate&s;t Delight in the Service of GOD and CHRIST. Then,</P>
<P N="3">3. As you de&s;ire to grow and improve in Grace, and ripen for Eternal Salvati|on, you mu&s;t carefully ob&s;erve the <HI>Sacra|ments</HI> of the New-Te&s;tament. The&s;e are <HI>two, viz.</HI> BAPTISM and the LORD's SUPPER. And they are "holy Ordi|nances in&s;tituted by CHRIST, wherein by &s;en&s;ible &s;igns, CHRIST and the Bene|fits of the New Covenant, are repre&s;ent|ed, &s;ealed and applied to Believers". And they are mo&s;t admirable Means for growth and increa&s;e in Grace. And therefore when GOD has ble&s;s'd the Word and Prayer, or any &s;pecial Providence, &s;o as to bring you to the happy Frame and Temper but now hinted, 'tis high time for you al&s;o to improve <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> and the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> as &s;pecial Means for your furtherance in the way to Salvation. And agreably, if you are come to adult Age, and have never yet been Bap|tized, you mu&s;t &s;peedily give up your Name Publickly to GOD in that Ordi|nance; or if you were Baptized in Infan|cy, 'tis equally nece&s;&s;ary that now you &s;hould in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner Renew
<PB N="93" REF="003231_0098_0FF025C9E0B8E078">
your Bapti&s;mal Covenant, and at the &s;ame time come up to the TABLE of the LORD: For if you can do one, you may do the other al&s;o, acceptably unto GOD. And therefore I put both together; and am grieved that &s;o many weak Chri&s;tians make &s;uch a groundle&s;s di&s;tinction be|tween them, as they do. I mean, as to their Qualifications for them. But to go on, you mu&s;t, as I &s;aid before, come up to, and improve the vi&s;ible Seals of the New Covenant, one or both of them, as your ca&s;e may require. They are both Command|ed Duty. <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> is &s;o; and is of great Importance to Salvation: As we find in <HI>Act.</HI> 2.38. where &s;ays <HI>Peter</HI> to the con|vinced <HI>Jews,</HI> in an&s;wer to that great In|quiry of their's, in the preceeding ver&s;e, <HI>What mu&s;t we do? You mu&s;t,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>Re|pent, and be Baptized every one of you in the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</HI> And the <HI>Lord's Supper</HI> is as &s;trict|ly required as Bapti&s;m. Luk. 22.19. &mdash; <HI>Do this,</HI> i. e. Take and eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, <HI>in remembrance of me.</HI> And therefore for any to live in a care|le&s;s neglect of them under this pretence, that they are not nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation, is a bold and daring affront to the Au|thority of GOD and CHRIST, and a cer|tain evidence of their unregenerate &s;tate.
<PB N="94" REF="003231_0099_0FF026841CA44680">
You mu&s;t therefore &s;ay and do otherwi&s;e if you intend to be &s;aved. That is, you mu&s;t own the nece&s;&s;ity of the&s;e Ordi|nances, and carefully ob&s;erve them. And they are (as I &s;aid before) mo&s;t admirable Means for a Chri&s;tian's Growth and Improvement in Grace. for in the&s;e Ordinances the Believer does, as it were, &s;et his Hand and Seal to the Covenant of Grace; and confirm the Dedication of him&s;elf unto GOD; and GOD at the &s;ame time makes over His CHRIST and all the Ble&s;&s;ings of the New Cove|nant to the Believing Soul in them. And then be&s;ides, the <HI>Lord's Supper</HI> is a precious means of intimate Communi|on with CHRIST; and the Believer fet|ches new Life, Strength, and Nouri&s;h|ment from his Redeemer, every time he eats and drinks in Faith at the Table of the Lord. And this prepares him more and more the full Enjoyment of GOD and CHRIST in Eternal Glory. Thus I have con&s;idered the <HI>In&s;tituted</HI> Means of Salvation; and &s;hewn how you mu&s;t improve them, if you mean to be &s;aved.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides the&s;e,</P>
<P N="2">2. THERE are the <HI>Occa&s;ional</HI> Means and Helps of Salvation; which you mu&s;t carefully ob&s;erve and
<PB N="95" REF="003231_0100_0FF025CC48065A10">
improve, if you de&s;ire to be &s;aved. And the&s;e are the REMARKABLE PRO|VIDENCES of GOD towards us in the World. And I call them Occa&s;ional Means: For, tho' GOD has not in&s;titu|ted them in His Word, as ordinary and nece&s;&s;ary Means of Salvation; yet, He frequently makes u&s;e of them for the Conviction and Conver&s;ion of Sinners. And when we meet with &s;uch Providen|ces, GOD commands us to ob&s;erve them, and improve them to our Spiritual Ad|vantage: as I could ea&s;ily make appear, if need were. And therefore, whenever you meet with any remarkable Di&s;pen&s;a|tions of Heaven, whether by way of <HI>Mercy</HI> or <HI>Judgment,</HI> you ought to im|prove them &s;o as to get Spiritual Good by them. Thus when you meet with any &s;ignal Mercies or Deliverances from the Hand of GOD, you &s;hould improve them &s;o, that by His Goodne&s;s you may be led to Repentance; for this is the &s;pe|cial End why GOD be&s;tows His Mer|cies upon Sinners. Rom. 2.4. <HI>Or de&s;pi&s;e&s;t thou the riches of his goodne&s;s, and forbear|ance, and long-&s;uffering, not knowing that the goodne&s;s of God leadeth thee to repen|tance?</HI> And &s;o when GOD &s;ends his Judgments upon you, and awakens you by them; or, threatens you by any ter|rible
<PB N="96" REF="003231_0101_0FF025CDE8A82078">
Di&s;pen&s;ation; as lately he threatned to de&s;troy us all in a moment, when the Earth quaked under us, our Hou&s;es &s;hook over us, and our Hearts were ready to fail within us: Such Providences you ought to &s;et a &s;pecial Remark upon. And as GOD does convince you of your Sins and awaken his Terrors in you by the&s;e Means: &s;o you mu&s;t hearken to the Call of GOD in them. You mu&s;t Repent of, and turn from, tho&s;e Sins, for which He is angry at you, and threatens you with &s;uch &s;everity: and beg of Him that the good Impre&s;&s;ions which &s;uch awful Di&s;|pen&s;ations are apt to make upon our Hearts, for the pre&s;ent, may not prove as <HI>the morning cloud and the early dew, which &s;oon pa&s;&s;eth away:</HI> but may prove abiding and &s;aving Impre&s;&s;ions: That the fruit of them may be to purge out Ini|quity, and take away Sin: and be in&s;tru|mental to bring you nearer to GOD and CHRIST. And then, you'l have rea&s;on for ever to ble&s;s GOD for them.</P>
<P>AND thus I have fini&s;hed the Second general Head in an&s;wer to the mo&s;t im|portant Inquiry in our Text. And now I go on to the la&s;t general Head in an&s;|wer to the &s;ame Que&s;tion. And this is,</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="003231_0102_0FF025D14657A458"><HI>Thirdly.</HI> IF you would be &s;aved you mu&s;t particularly <HI>clo&s;e in with the</HI> LORD JESUS CHRIST <HI>by</HI> FAITH, as He is of|fered to us in the Go&s;pel. And now I come to the main Article I have to con|&s;ider. For <HI>Faith in Chri&s;t</HI> is the very <HI>Hinge</HI> upon which the Eternal Salvation of a Sinner turns. And therefore, let a Sinner do ever &s;o much in Religion: Let him be ever &s;o diligent and con&s;tant in attending and improving all the other Means and Helps of Salvation; yet, if he neglects <HI>Faith in Chri&s;t,</HI> 'tis utterly im|po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould be &s;aved, according to the tenour of the New-Covenant: For our Saviour him&s;elf is very po&s;itive in this, Joh. 3.18. &mdash; <HI>He that believeth not is condemned already, becau&s;e he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</HI> And again in ver. 36<HI>th. &mdash; He that believeth not the Son, &s;hall not &s;ee life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</HI> But on the other hand; If a Sinner is once brought to clo&s;e in with Chri&s;t by Faith, upon Go&s;pel Terms, this will ef|fectually and infallibly &s;ecure his Eternal Salvation. This is evident from what our Saviour him&s;elf a&s;&s;erts in the places but now mentioned. Joh. 3.18, &amp; 36. <HI>He that believeth on him is not condemned.</HI> And again, <HI>He that believeth on the Son
<PB N="98" REF="003231_0103_0FF025D565228010">
hath everla&s;ting Life.</HI> And therefore, when the convinced <HI>Jaylor</HI> came to the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &amp; <HI>Silas</HI> his Companion, with that mo&s;t &s;erious and important Que&s;ti|on in his mouth, &mdash; <HI>Sirs, what mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI> as in the <HI>Text</HI>: They were at no lo&s;s at all what An&s;wer to give him, but immediately made that reply in the <HI>next ver&s;e, &mdash; Believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and thou &s;halt be &s;aved.</HI> As if they had &s;aid to him, <Q>Let your former Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions have been ever &s;o many and great; your Guilt contracted by them, of ever &s;o crim&s;on and bloody a Dye, and your Fears and Pro&s;pects on the account of them ever &s;o dark and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing; yet, if you will but go to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom GOD has given to die and ri&s;e again for the Salvation of Sinners, and do but Believe in Him alone for Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Salvation, you need not fear; your Sins, which are many &s;hall be forgiven, and the Guilt and Pollution of them wa&s;h'd away in His precious Blood: you &s;hall be ju&s;tified by His Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s; and &s;aved with an everla&s;ting Salvation, by His infinite Merit.</Q> And thus you &s;ee that Faith in Chri&s;t is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation, and that e|very one that does Believe aright in Him,

And therefore, Saving Faith is &s;aid expre&s;ly not to be <HI>of our &s;elves:</HI> but <HI>the Gift of God,</HI> in Eph. 2.8. Again,</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS Faith is wrought in the Heart of a <HI>Convinced</HI> Sinner. Not that every Convinced Sinner has &s;aving Faith wrought in him: For many a one that has been Convinced and Awakened, for a time, has found means to &s;hake off his Convictions; and &s;o at length dy'd in a &s;tate of Impenitency and Unbelief: But however, the Sinner mu&s;t be Convin|ced, and brought to a deep &s;en&s;e of his Sin and Mi&s;ery by Nature, and the ab&s;o|lute need he &s;tands in of Salvation, be|fore he can be willing to receive and em|brace a Saviour by Faith. For before
<PB N="101" REF="003231_0106_0FF025DB00B70B60">
this Conviction the Sinner &s;ees no need he &s;tands in of Salvation; and &s;o, is rea|dy to &s;light and contemn the offer of a Saviour; as they did, whom our Lord upbraids, in Joh. 4.40. <HI>Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</HI> And therefore, this Conviction is nece&s;&s;ary to prepare the way for Faith in Chri&s;t. And agreably, &s;uch Sinners only are cal|led upon <HI>immediately</HI> to clo&s;e in with Chri&s;t by Faith; as you may &s;ee in <HI>Matth.</HI> 11.28. <HI>Joh.</HI> 7.37, 38, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But however,</P>
<P N="3">3. BEFORE the Convinced Sinner actually clo&s;es in with Chri&s;t by Faith, he has a <HI>Di&s;covery of Chri&s;t,</HI> as He is revealed and offered to us in the Go&s;pel. For, the Holy Spirit, who fir&s;t convinces the Sinner of his Guilt and Pollution by Nature, and of the need he &s;tands in of Salvation, goes on to Reveal to him where his Help is to be found, and makes Chri&s;t known to his Soul. He &s;hews the Sinner the glorious Contrivance of GOD for our Salvation by a Redeemer, and re|veals the only SAVIOUR to him in the Glory and Fulne&s;s of his Per&s;on, Offices and Benefits. This is plain from what our Saviour &s;aid to <HI>Peter</HI> upon his declar|ing Him to <HI>be the Chri&s;t, the Son of the
<PB N="102" REF="003231_0107_0FF025DE60746150">
living God,</HI> in <HI>Mat.</HI> 16.16. For upon this &s;ays Chri&s;t in the <HI>next ver&s;e, &mdash; Ble&s;&s;ed art thou Simon Bar-jona: for fle&s;h and blood hath not revealed it unto thee: but my father which is in heaven.</HI> And when the Sinner has once gain'd a true Di&s;|covery of Chri&s;t, Then,</P>
<P N="4">4. HE highly <HI>Approves</HI> of the Method of our Redemption and Salvation by Him. For the Convinced and Enlightened Sin|ner, beholding the infinite Wi&s;dom and Grace of GOD in this Contrivance of Salvation by JESUS CHRIST; and &s;eeing that it is wonderfully adapted beyond any other way whatever, to advance the great Ends propo&s;ed in the Salvation of a Sinner; which are the Glory of GOD, and the Happine&s;s of the poor Sinner; he is bro't immediately to Receive this Revelation concerning Chri&s;t, <HI>as a faith|ful &s;aying, and worthy of all Acceptation;</HI> as we find in 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.15.</P>
<P>And upon this,</P>
<P N="5">5. THE Sinner that has Faith wrought in his Heart, willingly <HI>Receives</HI> and <HI>Em|braces</HI> CHRIST, as He is revealed in the Go&s;pel. That is, he freely accepts Him as His Lord and Saviour: He clo&s;es in with Him in all his Offices, as the Pro|phet,
<PB N="103" REF="003231_0108_0FF025E0C7081C20">
Prie&s;t and King of his Salvation; and embraces Him thus upon His own Terms; being ready and willing to <HI>be</HI> and <HI>do,</HI> all that Chri&s;t requires, that he may be &s;aved by Him. And upon his thus receiving Chri&s;t,</P>
<P N="6">6. THE Believing Sinner <HI>Re&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Relies</HI> upon Him alone for Salvation. That is, He wholly and forever Re|nounces all other Methods and Propo|&s;als of Salvation, and has no Dependance upon any thing but Chri&s;t for the Salva|tion he needs. And he &s;ees &s;uch a &s;uita|blene&s;s in Chri&s;t, &s;uch an infinite Fulne&s;s and Sufficiency in Him, that he finds he may &s;afely depend upon Him; and &s;o ca&s;ts the whole Burden, and leans all the Weight of his Eternal Salvation upon Him; hoping that <HI>Chri&s;t will be made unto him, of God, Wi&s;dom, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Sanctification and Redemption,</HI> as in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.30. "And what&s;oever fears he hath, yet he re&s;olves here he will lie, and go no whither el&s;e, for what he wants: &s;ay|ing, as Joh. 6.68. &mdash; <HI>Lord, to whom &s;hould we go? Thou ha&s;t the words of eternal Life."</HI></P>
<P>THUS I have given you a &s;hort Ac|count of true and &s;aving Faith, only as
<PB N="104" REF="003231_0109_0FF025E32F52AF60">
a Foundation to what I am to con&s;ider more largely under the next general Head. But I &s;hall go no further at this time; but conclude this Di&s;cour&s;e, with a &s;hort <HI>Reflection</HI> or <HI>two,</HI> on what has been &s;aid concerning the general Nature of Go&s;pel Faith, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of it for Salvation.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Infer.</HI> WE hence learn that <HI>true and &s;aving Faith, is quite another thing,</HI> than mo&s;t Men take it to be. For the gene|rality, even of tho&s;e who are favour'd with Go&s;pel Revelation, are ready to i|magine, That Divine Faith con&s;i&s;ts only in <HI>a bare Belief,</HI> or <HI>A&s;&s;ent</HI> of their Un|der&s;tandings to the Truth of this Reve|lation. And therefore, if you Di&s;cour&s;e with them about the Nature of &s;aving Faith; and inquire, whether they have any grounds to conclude they have this Faith in them? They'l readily reply; That they are no Infidels: For, they be|lieve that the Scriptures are the Word of GOD, and that the Doctrines revealed in them are the Truths of GOD: And, in particular, That they believe that Chri&s;t, who is &s;o much &s;poken of in the Go&s;pel, died for the Salvation of Sinners; and upon this, they expre&s;s a Confidence,
<PB N="105" REF="003231_0110_0FF025E769D6B950">
that God, who is a merciful GOD, will &s;ave them for His &s;ake. And if you go on to Inquire, How they came by this Faith? They'l &s;ay, This is the Faith they were born and brought up in. And this is the be&s;t Account they can give of the matter: And therefore, this is all the Foundation they have to build their Hopes for Heaven and Happine&s;s upon. But, believe it Sinner, if you have no other notion of true and &s;aving Faith than this, your Faith is no better, than <HI>the Faith of Devils;</HI> for, doubtle&s;s, they have as clear an under&s;tanding of the Scripture-revelation concerning Chri&s;t, and as firmly a&s;&s;ent to the truth of it, as you can do. (See <HI>Jam.</HI> 2.19.) And by con|&s;equence, all the Hopes you ground up|on this Faith are vain and pre&s;umptuous. And 'tis very lamentable to think, how many poor Sinners go on, all their days, in this groundle&s;s pre&s;umption; and won't &s;uffer any one to rectify this <HI>fatal</HI> mi&s;take for them, nor be at any pains to do it them&s;elves, 'till they come to be convinced of their <HI>Error,</HI> in the Agonies of Death: And then their fal&s;e Hopes vani&s;h in a moment, and endle&s;s De&s;pair &s;eizes upon them: Agreable to that, in Prov. 11.7. <HI>When a wicked man dieth, his expectation &s;hall peri&s;h: and the hope of
<PB N="106" REF="003231_0111_0FF025EAB77328F0">
unju&s;t men peri&s;heth.</HI> O then! if you have any de&s;ire at all to be Saved, be|ware of this pre&s;umptuous Faith and Hope: And while you have Time and Means for it, &s;earch narrowly into the Nature and Grounds of true and &s;aving Faith. Study the Holy Scriptures with care and diligence, to &s;ee what account they give of this Faith, and Pray to GOD to enlighten you in the knowledge of this My&s;tery: And then, I am per&s;waded you'l &s;oon be convinced, that the <HI>Faith of God's Elect,</HI> contains much more in it, than the naked a&s;&s;ent of their Under|&s;tandings to the faith of the Scripture-revelation concerning Chri&s;t: And in particular, that it al&s;o comprehends in it, the Souls delightful Approbation of the Method of our Redemption by Him: and the hearty Con&s;ent of the Will, to Re|ceive and Embrace Him, in all His Offi|ces, and upon His own Terms &amp;c. as I hinted before, and &s;hall more fully make out in the following Di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>And then,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Infer.</HI> SINCE this Faith is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation, you ought to be <HI>greatly concerned</HI> how to obtain it. And mu&s;t take the &s;ame pains to become
<PB N="107" REF="003231_0112_0FF025EC433749B8">
a &s;incere Believer in Chri&s;t, that you would to &s;ecure your Title to Heaven and Glory. For there is an in&s;eparable Connection between them. That is, Faith <HI>unites</HI> the Soul to Chri&s;t; and this Union <HI>entitles</HI> the Believer to all the Benefits of Redemption by Him. And therefore, our Saviour a&s;&s;ures us, in Mar. 16.16. <HI>He that believeth &mdash; &s;hall be &s;a|ved; but he that believeth not &s;hall be damned.</HI> Well then, &s;ince Faith is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to Salvation, let this be your next Inquiry, How &s;hall I obtain this Faith? What Cour&s;e mu&s;t I take? What Means mu&s;t I u&s;e for this End? And this will prepare the way, for a chearful Compliance with tho&s;e weighty Directi|ons, which are the Subject of the follow|ing Di&s;cour&s;es.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON V.</HEAD>
<P>_IN the la&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e I gave you a &s;hort Account of the Nature and Importance of Go&s;pel Faith, as a Means to Salvation.</P>
<P>And now,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I proceed to &s;how <HI>what Cour&s;e</HI> a poor Convinced Sinner mu&s;t take, to obtain this Faith in CHRIST, and be &s;aved by Him.</P>
<P>AND here I &s;hall &s;ay, I. You mu&s;t en|deavour to See and Know, what a Savi|our CHRIST is. Upon which, II. You mu&s;t con&s;ent to Receive and Embrace Him, in all His Offices, and upon His own Terms. And when you have done this, III. You mu&s;t have your whole De|pendance upon Him alone for Salvation. The&s;e are the three Principal DIRECTI|ONS, that are to be attended in this Ca&s;e:
<PB N="109" REF="003231_0114_0FF025F11D6FB4A0">
And every Sinner that is enabled, by the Grace of GOD, to comply with them, is a Believer in Chri&s;t, and has a &s;ure and unalienable Title to Eternal Life. I &s;hall therefore &s;peak &s;omething di&s;tinctly to each of the&s;e Heads. And &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">I. IF you de&s;ire to obtain a true and &s;aving Faith in JESUS CHRIST, you mu&s;t endeavour to <HI>&s;ee</HI> and <HI>know</HI> what a SA|VIOUR He is. For, without an agreable Knowledge of Him, there can be no &s;av|ing Faith in Him. This is evident from that of the Apo&s;tle, in <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.14. &mdash; <HI>How &s;hall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?</HI> The Apo&s;tle &s;peaks here by way of Interrogation: "which is the more convincing; becau&s;e it car|ries in it, a &s;ort of appeal to the per&s;ons &s;poken to". And this kind of Interro|gation is equivalent to a negative Propo|&s;ition: &s;o that the &s;en&s;e of the words is plainly this, <HI>viz.</HI> Men mu&s;t hear of Chri&s;t, and &s;o come to the Knowledge of Him, or they can never Believe in Him, &s;o as to be &s;aved by Him. And the Rea&s;on is evidently this, That Faith, which is not grounded upon &s;ome proper Knowledge of the Object of it, is Faith without a Foundation; and &s;o is but a mere Fancy, or vain Credulity, rather
<PB N="110" REF="003231_0115_0FF025F497E6B2B8">
than true Faith. But, on the other hand, if the Sinner is once thoroughly acquain|ted with the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of Chri&s;t, and comes to know, in a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e, what a Saviour is provided for us, he'll &s;oon be brought to Believe and Tru&s;t in Him for Eternal Life. For <HI>David</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, in P&s;al. 9.10. <HI>They that know the name of the Lord will put their Tru&s;t in him.</HI> And agreably, this Knowledge is call'd <HI>Eternal Life,</HI> Joh. 17.3. <HI>And this is Life Eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent.</HI> i. e. there is an in&s;eparable Con|nection between the true Knowledge of Chri&s;t, and Salvation by Him. And that you may not be at a lo&s;s to know what I intend by this Knowledge of Chri&s;t, which is e&s;&s;ential to true Faith, and lays the Foundation for a Sinners clo&s;ing in immediately with Him for Salvation, I &s;hall give you this &s;hort De&s;cription of it, namely, <HI>This Knowledge of Chri&s;t is that inward and &s;piritual Acquaintance with the Doctrine of Chri&s;t, as revealed to us in the Go&s;pel, which gains the A&s;&s;ent of the Under&s;tanding to the Truth of this Revelation, and the Approbation of his Judgment to the Rea&s;onablene&s;s and Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of our Salvation by Him.</HI> In this De&s;cription there are two principal Ar|ticles
<PB N="111" REF="003231_0116_0FF025F61F286508">
contain'd; which (tho' you have had &s;ome Hints upon them, in the ge|neral Account of true and &s;aving Faith) I &s;hall more particularly open and explain in this place. And &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. THIS Knowledge &s;uppo&s;es <HI>a thorow Acquaintance with</HI> the DOCTRINE of CHRIST, <HI>as Revealed to us in the Go&s;|pel.</HI> And therefore, every one that has this Knowledge, is &s;o well acquainted with the Go&s;pel Revelation, that he is able to give a good account of what the Scriptures &s;ay concerning the Per&s;on, the Nature, the Offices, the Benefits of Chri&s;t, and other Articles of this kind; which the Scriptures reveal, and have made nece&s;&s;ary to be known to Salva|tion. And this is what we u&s;ually call, <HI>the Doctrinal Knowledge of CHRIST.</HI> And &s;ince the&s;e Lines may, probably, fall into the Hands of &s;ome awakened Ones, who are very <HI>ignorant</HI> of the Redeemer; and who, by rea&s;on of their <HI>unskilfulne&s;s</HI> in &s;earching the Scriptures, and compar|ing one Text with another, mu&s;t needs &s;pend a great deal of Time and Pains, without &s;ome more compendious Help, to gain a competent Knowledge of Chri&s;t; I &s;hall for the Information of the&s;e, give a <HI>&s;ummary</HI> Account of this
<PB N="112" REF="003231_0117_0FF025F7A912D0F8">
Doctrine, as it is revealed and made known to us in the Go&s;pel. And accordingly, you mu&s;t know, That the Saviour, whom you are bound to believe in, "is both GOD and MAN in two di&s;tinct Natures and one Per&s;on forever". And therefore, He is &s;ometimes called GOD. See Joh. 1.1. <HI>In the beginning was the WORD, and the WORD was with GOD, and the WORD was GOD.</HI> And Rom. 9.5. <HI>CHRIST, who is over all, GOD BLESSED FOR EVER.</HI> And &s;ome|times He is called MAN, as in 1 Tim. 2.5. &mdash; <HI>The MAN CHRIST JESUS.</HI> And by the UNION of the&s;e two Na|tures, in one Per&s;on, He is called EMMA|NUEL, <HI>which, being interpreted, is God with us,</HI> or, God in our Nature, <HI>Math.</HI> 1.23. And as Chri&s;t is both God and Man in one Per&s;on; you mu&s;t know, that according to His DIVINE NATURE, He is <HI>the Son of God, and the only begotten of the Father.</HI> See <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.34. <HI>Chap.</HI> 3.18. with many more places: and that this SONSHIP is by <HI>eternal</HI> and <HI>ineffable</HI> Ge|neration: For the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> &s;peak|ing of Him &s;ays, in Chap. 53.8. &mdash; <HI>Who &s;hall declare his Generation?</HI> And being thus the SON of GOD, you mu&s;t under|&s;tand, that He is the Second Per&s;on in the adorable Trinity; the &s;ame in Sub|&s;tance,
<PB N="113" REF="003231_0118_0FF025FA1D502A68">
and equal in Power and Glory, with the FATHER and the HOLY GHOST: For we read in Joh. 5.7. <HI>There are three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Gho&s;t: and the&s;e three are One.</HI> And concerning this WORD, we are taught in Phil. 3.6 <HI>That being in the form of God, he tho't it not robbery to be equal with God:</HI> being <HI>the brightne&s;s of the Father's Glory, and the expre&s;s image of his Per&s;on:</HI> as we find in <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.3. And then, as for the HUMA|NITY of Chri&s;t, you mu&s;t know, that this Glorious SON of GOD <HI>a&s;&s;umed,</HI> or took our Nature into, that which we call, a <HI>Per&s;onal Union</HI> with his Divine Nature: And the manner of it, was, by His <HI>being conceived by the power of the Holy-Gho&s;t, in the womb of the virgin Mary,</HI> Math. 1.20. And by this means, He wholly e&s;cap'd the Guilt and Pollution we bro't into the World with us, in the way of natural Generation. This we learn from Luk. 1.35. <HI>And the Angel &s;aid unto her,</HI> i.e. unto <HI>Mary,</HI> the Mother of our Lord, <HI>The Holy Gho&s;t &s;hall come upon thee, and the Power of the Highe&s;t &s;hall over &s;hadow thee: therefore that HOLY THING that &s;hall be born of thee, &s;hall be called, the SON OF GOD.</HI> And agreably, He is &s;aid, in Heb. 7.26. &mdash; <HI>to be holy, harmle&s;s, unde|filed,
<PB N="114" REF="003231_0119_0FF025FE5BB2F140">
&s;eparate from &s;inners.</HI> The&s;e are the things you mu&s;t learn concerning the Nature and Con&s;titution of Chri&s;t's Per&s;on. And by this means, you will &s;oon un|der&s;tand how admirably He is fitted to accompli&s;h the great Work of our Re|demption. And accordingly, you mu&s;t know, that this ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Immanuel</HI> is the <HI>only</HI> Per&s;on, whom the Father has con|&s;tituted to be the MEDIATOR of the New Covenant: As we find in 1 Tim. 2.5. <HI>For there is one God, and one Medi|ator between God and men, the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> And by con&s;equence, that He is the very Saviour that was <HI>promi&s;ed</HI> to our fir&s;t Parents, as &s;oon as they &s;tood in need of &s;uch an one, <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.15. And the Per|&s;on, whom, <HI>when the fulne&s;s of time came, the FATHER &s;ent into the world, made of a woman, made under the law to redeem them that were under the law;</HI> as we read in <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.4, 5. And that He might more effectually di&s;charge this high Tru&s;t, you you mu&s;t know further, that He is, more particularly, ve&s;ted with a threefold Office of <HI>Prophet, Prie&s;t</HI> and <HI>King,</HI> "which He executeth as our Redeemer, both in His &s;tate of Humiliation and Ex|altation". (1.) With the Office of a PRO|PHET; as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> foretold of Him in Deut. 18.15. <HI>The Lord thy God will rai&s;e up
<PB N="115" REF="003231_0120_0FF025FFE4B49370">
unto thee a Prophet from the mid&s;t of thy brethren like unto me, unto him &s;hall ye hearken.</HI> Which words are interpreted of Chri&s;t, in <HI>Act.</HI> 3.22. And this Office He di&s;charges "in his revealing to his Peo|ple, by his Word and Spirit, the will of GOD for their Salvation". Again (2.) He is ve&s;ted with the Office of a PRIEST. Heb. 5.5, 10. <HI>So al&s;o Chri&s;t glorified not him&s;elf to be made an high Prie&s;t: but he that &s;aid unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee. &mdash; Called of God an high Prie&s;t.</HI> And in the Execution of this Office, you mu&s;t know, that when He was here, in our Nature, He did, in his Obedience unto Death, offer up Him|&s;elf a <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> to atone the Ju&s;tice of GOD for our Offences; a Sacrifice that had infinite Merit in it, and &s;o was infi|nitely plea&s;ing to the FATHER, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.5. And that after He had made this <HI>Expiati|on</HI> for us, by His Sufferings and Death, He <HI>aro&s;e</HI> out of the Grave <HI>for our Ju&s;tificati|on,</HI> (Rom. 4.25.) <HI>a&s;cended</HI> into Heaven, <HI>leading Captivity Captive,</HI> (Eph. 4.8.) And is there <HI>&s;eated</HI> at the Right Hand of GOD, where <HI>He ever liveth to make Interce&s;&s;ion for us,</HI> (Heb. 7.25.) And then (3.) JESUS CHRIST is ve&s;ted the Office of a KING. For He is <HI>the King whom the Fa|ther has &s;et upon his holy hill of Zion,</HI> (P&s;al.
<PB N="116" REF="003231_0121_0FF0260332D3BFD0">
2.6.) And being exalted to that Dignity, you mu&s;t know that <HI>He has a name given him above every name: that at the name of JESUS every knee &s;hould bow, of things in Heaven, and things in Earth, &amp; things under the Earth; and that every Tongue &s;hould confe&s;s, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is Lord, to the glory of God the Father,</HI> (Phil. 3.9, 10, 11.) And that, in the Execution of this Office, He now Over-rules and Go|verns all things in the Kingdom of Grace and Providence, for the good of His Re|deemed, (<HI>Heb.</HI> 2.8.) And will finally come <HI>to Judge the World in Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> (Act. 17.31.) And &s;o <HI>render to every man ac|cording to his deeds: to them who by pa|tient continuance in well-doing, &s;eek for glory, and honour, and Immortality; Eter|nal Life: But unto them that are conten|tious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteou&s;ne&s;s; Indignation &amp; Wrath, Tribulation and Angui&s;h</HI>&mdash; (Rom. 2, 7, 8, 9.) And as nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Inferences</HI> from all that has been &s;aid concerning the <HI>Per&s;on</HI> and <HI>Offices</HI> of Chri&s;t, you mu&s;t farther know, that this JESUS is an ALMIGHTY SAVIOUR; <HI>able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t all that come unto God by Him,</HI> (Heb. 7.25.) Again, That He is a mo&s;t WILLING and COM|PASSIONATE SAVIOUR; and will never reject any that go to GOD in and thro'

<P>THUS I have given you a brief Account of the Principal Things, which are re|vealed to us in the Scriptures concerning Chri&s;t: And they are, every one of them, of very great Importance, if not of ab&s;o|lute Nece&s;&s;ity, to be known, that &s;o you may obtain true and &s;aving Faith in Him.

And herein con&s;i&s;ts the very <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> of true and &s;aving Knowledge: or, <HI>that,</HI> whereby the Knowledge of the Believer, is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Know|ledge

of all other Men whatever. For many Unconverted Per&s;ons, under the Light of the Go&s;pel, are as well acquaint|ed with the Scripture-revelation of Chri&s;t, as any of the Children of God; and can give a more di&s;tinct account of the Doc|trine of Chri&s;t, as it is taught us in the Go&s;pel, than many true Believers can do. But then, They, either look upon all that is &s;aid concerning Chri&s;t, in the Go&s;pel, to be but a mere <HI>Fable,</HI> and &s;o believe not one word that is &s;aid concerning Him; as the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Dei&s;ts,</HI> and &s;uch like Infidels do: or el&s;e, they are deeply prejudiced again&s;t this way of Salvation by Chri&s;t; and can't bear to think that HE &s;hould have all the Glory, and <HI>Men</HI> &s;o little of the Credit of a Sinners Salva|tion: And this is the Condition of all &s;uch who are building their Hopes for Heaven upon a Righteou&s;ne&s;s of their own. And therefore, this true and &s;av|ing Knowledge is &s;omething more than <HI>Speculative,</HI> which floats only in the Head and Imagination: it <HI>&s;inks deeper into the Heart,</HI> and takes fa&s;t hold of the &s;uperi|our and leading Powers of the Soul.

up with Pride, and becau&s;e the Spirit of GOD is the Author of it; as you will pre&s;ently here.

And to this firm a&s;&s;ent of the Under&s;tanding, he joyns the hearty <HI>Approbation</HI> of his Judgment; and is really Convinced, upon the mo&s;t im|partial Con&s;ideration, that the whole Contrivance of our Redemption by Chri&s;t, as it is made known to us in the Go&s;pel, is the mo&s;t Wi&s;e and Rea&s;onable, the mo&s;t Ju&s;t and Gracious, the mo&s;t Ho|nourable to GOD, and the &s;afe&s;t for the Sinner, that could po&s;&s;ibly be thought on: And &s;o receives it as <HI>a faithful &s;aying, and worthy of all acceptation,</HI> 1 Tim. 1.15.

<PB N="121" REF="003231_0126_0FF0261242A62190">
therein clearly Revealed to us: And therefore, in them&s;elves con&s;idered, they are the mo&s;t proper and natural Means, we can make u&s;e of, to come to an ex|act Knowledge of the Doctrine of Chri&s;t. But then, as we can never ju&s;tly expect to be the Ma&s;ters of this Knowledge, un|le&s;s we take Pains for it, in the way of Divine Appointment; that is, by <HI>Search|ing the Scriptures,</HI> to &s;ee what they Re|veal and Te&s;tify concerning Chri&s;t: as God commands us to do, in <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.39.

<P N="2">II.

For, the Faith of a <HI>Chri&s;ti|an</HI> is not, like the Faith of the <HI>Philo&s;o|pher,</HI> confined to the Head, but it ex|tends to the Heart al&s;o: It takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on both of the <HI>Under&s;tanding</HI> and <HI>Will;</HI> yea, 'tis <HI>eminently</HI> &s;eated in the <HI>Heart.</HI> For tho' there can be no &s;aving Faith in Chri&s;t without a Doctrinal Knowledge of Him; yet (as I &s;aid before) the large&s;t Degrees of this Knowledge alone, will not &s;ecure a &s;aving Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t. Whereas on the other hand, if any poor
<PB N="125" REF="003231_0130_0FF0261CB834C758">
Soul, who has but a competent Know|ledge in the Doctrine or Chri&s;t, does but heartily Con&s;ent to take Him for his Sa|viour, as He is offered in the Go&s;pel, he has that Faith in the Redeemer, which will immediately entitle him to Eternal Life. And therefore, this <HI>Con&s;ent of the Will,</HI> to receive and embrace Chri&s;t, <HI>is an E&s;&s;ential Act of SAVING FAITH;</HI> and of infinite Importance in the Salva|tion of a Sinner. And accordingly, we frequently read of it in the Go&s;pel of God our Saviour. 'Tis expre&s;s'd to us in one place under the notion of <HI>Receiving</HI> Chri&s;t, Joh. 1.12. <HI>To as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the &s;ons of God; even to them that believe on his Name.</HI> This <HI>Receiving</HI> is a relative Term, and nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es a previous Offer of Chri&s;t to us. For, (as One <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Taylor's</HI> Di&s;cour&s;e on Faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</NOTE> well ob&s;erves) "what is not &s;ent, or offer'd me, I may &s;natch at, or &s;eize by violence; but I can't properly he &s;aid to <HI>Receive</HI> it". Now this offer of Chri&s;t is made to us in the Go&s;pel, and the true Believer Receives Him, not <HI>phy&s;ically</HI> but in a <HI>moral</HI> &s;en&s;e, i. e. He gives in the full Con&s;ent of his Will, that Chri&s;t &s;hould be his upon Go&s;|pel Terms. <HI>Again,</HI> This Con&s;enting Act
<PB N="126" REF="003231_0131_0FF026201C4AF738">
of Faith is expre&s;&s;ed by Believing in Chri&s;t <HI>with all the Heart.</HI> Thus 'tis ex|pre&s;s'd by <HI>Philip</HI> in his An&s;wer to the <HI>Eunuch,</HI> when he reque&s;ted Bapti&s;m of him, Act. 8.38. <HI>If thou believe&s;t with all thine heart, thou may&s;t be bapti&s;ed.</HI> And &s;o 'tis expre&s;s'd again, in Rom. 10.10. <HI>With the heart man believeth unto righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> And in many other places to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. And therefore, if you truly de|&s;ire to be &s;aved, you mu&s;t and will give in the free and full Con&s;ent of your Soul to take Chri&s;t for your Saviour, ju&s;t as He is made known and offered to us in the Go&s;pel. And agreably, you mu&s;t be heartily willing to Receive Him, (1.) In all His Offices. And (2.) Upon His own Terms: For &s;o the Go&s;pel reveals and offers Him to us.</P>
<P N="1">(1.)

And the&s;e Sins do</HI> all <HI>and</HI> every one <HI>of them de|&s;erve the Damnation of Hell: and I am every moment expo&s;ed to that Damnation in the mo&s;t amazing Aggravations of it. And I tremble at the thoughts of that Wrath that is ready to fall upon me. O LORD, How &s;hall I make my E&s;cape? I am no ways able to Atone Divine Ju&s;tice for my manifold Offences. For, where|withal &s;hall I come before the LORD for

this end?</HI> Lebanon it &s;elf is not &s;ufficient to burn, nor the Bea&s;ts thereof &s;ufficient for a burnt-offering. <HI>And therefore, if I could offer thou&s;ands of Rams or ten thou|&s;ands of rivers of Oyl, if the fruit of my Body for the &s;in of my Soul, there would not be merit enough in all to procure the Pardon of the lea&s;t Sin. No, nor could a Sacrifice of the whole Creation yield a &s;ui|table Satisfaction for anyone of my manifold Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. But, Oh Dear LORD JESUS, I have heard of thee, that Thou ha&s;t loved poor Sinners, and given thy Self an Offering and a Sacrifice to GOD, of a &s;weet &s;melling &s;avour. Thou ha&s;t laid down thy precious Life for our Redempti|on; a Life that is worth infinitely more than the Lives of all the Angels in Heaven and Men on Earth. And therefore, that Sacrifice had infinite Merit in it; and ac|cordingly, Thou do&s;t ever live to plead the Virtue of it on the account of all that be|lieve in Thee: and if ever I obtain Pardon and Salvation, it mu&s;t be on the account of that Sacrifice alone. I fly to Thee there|fore, O LORD, for an Intere&s;t in thy pre|cious Sacrifice. I wholly renounce the Me|rit of my own Per&s;on and Services, and account my own Righteou&s;ne&s;s as filthy rags, and heartily &s;ubmit to Thee as</HI> the Lord my Righteou&s;ne&s;s. <HI>Oh! that my

Sins may be wa&s;h'd away in thy precious Blood! That the Merit of thy Sacrifice may be my Atonement! and thy Righteou&s;|ne&s;s alone be the Covering and Ornament of my naked Soul! My great de&s;ire is to obtain Pardon of Sin, Peace with GOD, Accep|tance with Him here, and Eternal Salva|tion in the World to come, only on the Ac|count of what Thou ha&s;t done and &s;uffer|ed, for the &s;ake of &s;uch mi&s;erable Sinners as I am.</HI></P>

I am a poor &s;inful and rebellious Creature. I was born an Enemy to thee, and have play'd the Rebel again&s;t thee all my Days.

<P>AND now, if you can but thus acknow|ledge CHRIST, and give in the free and full Con&s;ent of your Soul to Him, after this manner, in His Kingly Office, you then clo&s;e in with Him aright by Faith: and &s;hall certainly be &s;aved for ever un|der the Conduct of that Great <HI>Captain of our Salvation.</HI> For <HI>He is the Author of Eternal Salvation to all them that obey Him,</HI> Heb. 5.9.

<HEAD>SERMON VI.</HEAD>
<P>_IN the la&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e I propound|ed three general Directions for the obtaining that <HI>Faith</HI> in CHRIST, which will entitle a Sinner to Eternal Life. And they were, I. You mu&s;t See and Know what a Savi|our Chri&s;t is. II. You mu&s;t Con&s;ent to Receive and Embrace Him in all His Offices, and upon His own Terms. And III. You mu&s;t Rely upon Him alone for Salvation. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e Directions has been fully &s;poken to: and I have in <HI>part,</HI> con&s;idered the <HI>&s;econd</HI> of them; which I divided into the&s;e two Branches. And &s;aid, (1.) You mu&s;t Receive Chri&s;t in all His <HI>Offices.</HI> And (2.) Upon His own <HI>Terms.</HI> And I have told you already, how you are to Receive Him in the fir&s;t Re&s;|pect. And therefore, the <HI>next</HI> thing I am to ob&s;erve is this, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="141" REF="003231_0146_0FF02645E8ACB458">2. You mu&s;t be heartily willing to <HI>Receive</HI> and <HI>Embrace</HI> CHRIST, <HI>upon His own</HI> TERMS. There are indeed, many Sinners who would willingly accept of Chri&s;t and His Salvation, if they could but have them on their <HI>own</HI> Terms: But this can never be: becau&s;e Chri&s;t has &s;tated and fix'd His Terms in the Go&s;pel, and will not be the Saviour of any Sinner, un|le&s;s he approves of, and Con&s;ents to them. And agreably, it is in the Nature of Sav|ing Faith to clo&s;e in with Chri&s;t upon the Terms of His own propo&s;ing. For Faith &s;ees the&s;e Terms to be ab&s;olutely be&s;t in them&s;elves. And therefore if you would clo&s;e in with Chri&s;t by Faith for Salvation, you mu&s;t freely Con&s;ent to take Him for your Saviour upon His own Terms. And they are &s;uch as the&s;e,</P>
<P N="1">1. YOU mu&s;t Con&s;ent to take Him for your ONLY SAVIOUR. We read in Act. 4.12. <HI>Neither is there Salvation in any other: for there is no other name under hea|ven given among men whereby we can be &s;aved.</HI> That is, There is no One el&s;e that has undertaken the Work of our Re|demption for us; nor any one el&s;e that GOD will accept in this Affair. And therefore, Chri&s;t propo&s;es Him&s;elf to us as the only Saviour of mi&s;erable Sinners. I&s;ai.
<PB N="142" REF="003231_0147_0FF0264932D96138">
45.21, 22.&mdash; <HI>There is no God el&s;e be&s;ides me, a ju&s;t God and a Saviour &mdash; Look un|to me, and be ye &s;aved, all the ends of the Earth: for I am God and there is none el&s;e.</HI> And accordingly, if you would be &s;aved by Chri&s;t, you mu&s;t not &s;hare the Honour of your Salvation between Chri&s;t and another. No, not between Chri&s;t and your &s;elf; as the proud Sinner is ex|ceeding apt to do. But you mu&s;t &s;ay as the P&s;almi&s;t did, in P&s;al. 62.5, 6. <HI>My &s;oul, wait thou</HI> only <HI>upon God: for my ex|pectation is from him. He is my rock and my &s;alvation; He is my defence: I &s;hall not be moved.</HI> Again,</P>
<P N="2">2. YOU mu&s;t be <HI>content to part</HI> with every thing in the World, that is dear to you, and <HI>patiently &s;ubmit</HI> to any Hard|&s;hips and Sufferings, when the HONOUR and INTEREST of CHRIST call for them. This is what the Go&s;pel calls <HI>Self-denial</HI> and <HI>taking up the Cro&s;s,</HI> and our Saviour has made them a di&s;tingui&s;h|ing Mark of his true Di&s;ciples, and &s;o a nece&s;&s;ary Condition of Eternal Life, in Mar. 8.34. &mdash; <HI>Who&s;oever will come after me,</HI> &s;ays Chri&s;t, i. e. Who&s;oever would become one of my real Di&s;ciples, and expects to be &s;aved by me, <HI>Let him deny him&s;elf, and take up his Cro&s;s, and follow
<PB N="143" REF="003231_0148_0FF0264B99E79F50">
me.</HI> (1.) He mu&s;t <HI>deny him&s;elf.</HI> "By which (as a noted Expo&s;iter <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Burket</HI> in loc.</NOTE> ob&s;erves upon the place) we are not to under&s;tand the denying and renouncing our Sen&s;es in matters of Faith, not yet the renouncing our Rea&s;on in matters of Religion; but by <HI>Self-denyal</HI> is meant, that we &s;hould be willing to part with all our Earthly com|forts, and quit all our Temporal enjoy|ments, for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t and his Ho|ly Religion." i. e. when the Honour of Chri&s;t and the credit of Chri&s;tianity plain|ly calls us to do &s;o. And then, (2.) He mu&s;t <HI>take up his Cro&s;s.</HI> Which Expre&s;&s;ion (as the forecited Expo&s;itor ob&s;erves) is, "an Allu&s;ion to a <HI>Roman</HI> cu&s;tom that the Malefactor, who was to be Crucified, took his Cro&s;s upon his &s;houlder, and carried it to the place of Execution." And we find this exemplify'd in our Saviour Him|&s;elf, when He was unju&s;tly Condemned to dye on the Cro&s;s. (See <HI>Joh.</HI> 19.17.) And therefore, the &s;en&s;e of the <HI>Phra&s;e</HI> is evidently this, viz. That the Di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t, tho' he may not, by an intempe|rate <HI>Zeal,</HI> run him&s;elf into any needle&s;s Trouble, and &s;o make a Cro&s;s for him&s;elf; yet, he mu&s;t be di&s;po&s;ed and firmly re|&s;olved, patiently to bear any Affliction,
<PB N="144" REF="003231_0149_0FF0264D24376C60">
which GOD in his Providence &s;hall &s;ee meet to lay upon him: and in particular, if GOD &s;ees it mo&s;t for His own Glory, he mu&s;t chearfully &s;ubmit to the lo&s;s of all that is dear to him in the World; to the lo&s;s of his Earthly E&s;tate, Friends, and Reputation among Men: and be rea|dy to endure any kind of Sufferings in the Body, even to the laying down of his Life, for Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake. And we have many very noble and <HI>Heroic</HI> exam|ples of this <HI>Self-denial</HI> and <HI>bearing the Cro&s;s,</HI> Recorded in the Sacred Scriptures; and particularly, of the Primitive Chri&s;ti|ans, <HI>who took joyfully the &s;poiling of their goods, and &s;uffered the lo&s;s of all things,</HI> for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.34. But of all the examples of this kind, tho&s;e of the Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> were the mo&s;t noted, and &s;o the mo&s;t worthy our Imitation; as we find by the account which one of them has given of the matter, in 1 Cor. 4.11, 12, 13. <HI>Even unto this pre&s;ent hour, we both hunger and thir&s;t, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place, and labour working with our own hands: being reviled, we ble&s;s: being per|&s;ecuted, we &s;uffer it: being defamed, we en|treat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the off-&s;couring of all things unto this day.</HI> And their Sufferings in the&s;e
<PB N="145" REF="003231_0150_0FF0264EAFFFD780">
re&s;pects, were &s;o many and great, that the Apo&s;tle draws this Conclu&s;ion from them in the 9<HI>th</HI> v. of this Chapter. <HI>For I think that GOD hath &s;et forth us the Apo&s;tles la&s;t, as it were appointed to death. For we are made a &s;pectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.</HI> And tho' it does not fall to the &s;hare of every true Chri&s;tian to endure &s;uch a Variety, and &s;uch Extremity of Sufferings, for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t; yet, every one mu&s;t endeavour to bring his Spirit to &s;ubmit to them, if GOD &s;hould call him thereunto. For Chri&s;t has made it nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould do &s;o: and has plainly told us, that unle&s;s we have &s;omething of this holy <HI>Temper</HI> in us, we cannot be His Di&s;|ciples, Luk. 14.26, 27. <HI>If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, and wife and children, and brethren and &s;i&s;ters, yea, and his own life al&s;o, he cannot be my di&s;ciple. And who&s;oever doth not bear his cro&s;s, and come after me, cannot be my di&s;ciple.</HI> Which <HI>Hatred</HI> is not to be under&s;tood in an <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> but <HI>comparative</HI> &s;en&s;e. And accordingly, our Saviour ex|plains this &s;evere pa&s;&s;age after this man|ner, Math. 10.37, 38. <HI>He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not wor|thy of me: and he that loveth &s;on or daugh|ter more than me, is not worthy of me. And
<PB N="146" REF="003231_0151_0FF02653F3383690">
he that taketh not his cro&s;s, and followeth After me, is not worthy of me.</HI> So that the meaning of both together is this, <HI>viz.</HI> We mu&s;t love Chri&s;t and His Intere&s;t &s;o much more than we do the deare&s;t of our Enjoyments in the World, that we mu&s;t be willing to part with them all, if He &s;hould call us to do &s;o.</P>
<P N="3">3. ANOTHER <HI>Term</HI> upon which you mu&s;t Receive Chri&s;t is this, namely, You mu&s;t chearfully <HI>&s;ubmit</HI> your &s;elf to the <HI>Yoke of</HI> GOSPEL OBEDIENCE, and <HI>Fol|low the</HI> EXAMPLE of the LORD JESUS CHRIST. This is a Term of Chri&s;t's own propo&s;ing; as you may &s;ee, in Math. 11.29. <HI>Take my Yoke upon you, and learn of me.</HI> By the <HI>Yoke</HI> of Chri&s;t here, we are to under&s;tand Go&s;pel Obedience to His holy Commandments: and to <HI>learn of Him,</HI> is to learn by his <HI>Example,</HI> to tread in his Steps, and be Imitators of him as dear Children. And this he propounds as a nece&s;&s;ary Condition of Eternal Life, Math. 12.17. &mdash; <HI>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the Commandments.</HI> And again, Heb. 5.9. <HI>He is the author of eternal &s;alvation unto all them that obey him.</HI> And, indeed, to none el&s;e: for we read in the Twelfth Chapter of this Epi&s;tle, ver. 14. <HI>Without holine&s;s no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord.</HI> So that, you
<PB N="147" REF="003231_0152_0FF026557AE0DC58">
&s;ee, this Go&s;pel Obedience is nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation: Not as the <HI>meritorious</HI> Cau&s;e of it; for &s;o Chri&s;t alone has <HI>purcha&s;ed</HI> Eternal Redemption for us: but as it is the <HI>fruit</HI> and <HI>evidence</HI> of our Faith in Him. For, as I ob&s;erved before, in Receiving Chri&s;t by Faith, you accept of Him in His <HI>Kingly Office;</HI> and therein take the Oath of Allegiance to Him, and <HI>&s;ware to keep all his righteous Commandments,</HI> P&s;al. 119.106. And if you are &s;incere in what you do, that Faith, whereby you &s;o receive Chri&s;t, will produce this holy Obedience in your Life and Conver&s;ation. And that you may not be at a lo&s;s to know what is meant by this Obedience, I &s;hall &s;ay in a Word,</P>
<P>BY this Obedience, we are not to un|der&s;tand <HI>a &s;inle&s;s and perfect Obedience to the whole Law of GOD: but a &s;incere Purpo&s;e and Endeavour, by the help of the Spirit, to reach as near to that perfect Obedience as 'tis po&s;&s;ible for one in this &s;tate of Imperfection to do.</HI> So that in yielding this Obedience, the Heart is fir&s;t fully <HI>Re&s;olved</HI> upon the Duty; and this Re&s;o|lution becomes a fix'd &amp; governing Tem|per in the Mind. And agreably, <HI>in the next place,</HI> this Re&s;olution is brought forth into <HI>Act,</HI> and is expre&s;s'd in the Chri&s;tians uniform, &s;teady and diligent
<PB N="148" REF="003231_0153_0FF02658C2589218">
Endeavours to walk in all the Ordinances and Commandments of the LORD blame|le&s;s to his Heavenly Kingdom: And <HI>in all,</HI> he has dependance upon the SPIRIT of CHRIST, for the <HI>Pardon</HI> of his many defects in Duty, and for the <HI>Acceptance</HI> of his Per&s;on and Services with the FA|THER. And that you may not be at a lo&s;s to know what RULE to go by, in yeilding this Chri&s;tian Obedience, you mu&s;t be &s;ure to make the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t the only Rule and Mea&s;ure of it; and &s;ee that in all things <HI>your Conver&s;ation be as becometh the Go&s;pel.</HI> And in particular, &s;ince Chri&s;t has left us a mo&s;t perfect <HI>Ex|ample</HI> of holy Obedience to GOD, and Commanded His Di&s;ciples to be <HI>Followers of Him,</HI> (Math. 16.24.) you mu&s;t be &s;ure to have His &s;potle&s;s Example as much as po&s;&s;ible in your Eye, and &s;trive to <HI>imi|tate</HI> Him in all his <HI>imitable</HI> Perfections. And more e&s;pecially, in His Meekne&s;s and Humility; in his Patience under Suffer|ings; in his Love and Compa&s;&s;ion to Mankind, which expre&s;s'd it &s;elf in his readine&s;s to do Good to them upon all Occa&s;ions: In his Zeal again&s;t Sin, and for the Glory of GOD; in his fervent Devotion to the FATHER; in his entire Submi&s;&s;ion to His Will under all his Tri|als and Temptations; in his un&s;haken
<PB N="149" REF="003231_0154_0FF0265B28961748">
Faith and Dependance upon Him; and finally, in his unwearied Diligence to work the Works of Him that &s;ent him while the Day of Life la&s;ted.</P>
<P>AND thus I have fini&s;hed the Second general Direction, I propo&s;ed to &s;peak to, for the obtaining true and &s;aving Faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; viz. <HI>You mu&s;t heartily Con&s;ent to, Receive and Em|brace Chri&s;t in all his Offices, and upon his own Terms.</HI> And here I have parti|cularly &s;hown you, How you are to Re|ceive and Walk in Him, in both the&s;e Re&s;pects. And now there remains but one Important Direction more of this kind: And this is,</P>
<P N="3">III. IF you would believe in Chri&s;t to the Saving of the Soul, you mu&s;t put your <HI>whole</HI> TRUST <HI>in, and</HI> RELY <HI>upon</HI> HIM ALONE, for Salvation. I am &s;en&s;i|ble indeed, this Act of <HI>Reliance</HI> is treat|ed mo&s;t unworthily by many in the World: And by tho&s;e in particular, of the <HI>Pelagian</HI> and <HI>Arminian</HI> Principles, who make a Banter of it, both in the Pulpit, and from the Pre&s;s; as they do of the whole Doctrine of a Sinner's Ju&s;tifi|cation and Salvation <HI>by Faith in Chri&s;t without the Deeds of the Law:</HI> though
<PB N="150" REF="003231_0155_0FF0265D912E3568">
therein, I think, they expre&s;ly contradict the in&s;pired Apo&s;tle, in <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.28. And therefore, whatever any Men may &s;ay to the contrary, This Reliance upon Chri&s;t is a mo&s;t noble and nece&s;&s;ary Act of true and &s;aving Faith. It is a mo&s;t <HI>noble Act</HI> of Faith, and greatly glorifies the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. "For in thus doing (as One &s;ays well) we practically declare, in de&s;pite of all Di&s;couragements, that we are firmly per&s;waded of Chri&s;t's Love and Grace, Faithfulne&s;s and Power, &mdash; of the merits of His Blood, the value of His In|terce&s;&s;ion, and the truth of His Promi&s;es&punc; and &s;et our Seal to the Record given of Him in the Word, that <HI>He is able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t, all that come to God thro' Him;</HI> and <HI>will not ca&s;t out any,</HI> that &s;e|riou&s;ly apply them&s;elves to Him for Sal+vation". And as it is a mo&s;t noble, &s;o it is a mo&s;t <HI>nece&s;&s;ary Act</HI> of true and &s;aving Faith. That is, Let Men think and &s;ay what they plea&s;e of it, there is no obtain|ing Eternal Life, but by having our whole Dependance upon Chri&s;t for it, as we are directed to have in the Go&s;pel. And therefore this Act of Faith is frequently &s;poken of, and great &s;tre&s;s laid upon it, in the Holy Scriptures. And I &s;hall en|deavour to give you &s;ome under&s;tanding of the Nature of it, by con&s;idering a few
<PB N="151" REF="003231_0156_0FF0265FF50EEE78">
of the Expre&s;&s;ions whereby 'tis made known to us&punc; Particularly,</P>
<P>'TIS expre&s;&s;ed by <HI>Tru&s;ting</HI> in CHRIST for Salvation. P&s;al. 2.12. &mdash; <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are all they that Tru&s;t in him.</HI> And &s;o a|gain in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 9.10. and in many other places. Now this &s;uppo&s;es, that the Be|lieving Sinner, who has received Chri&s;t in all His Offices, &s;ees enough in Him to an&s;wer all his Wants and Nece&s;&s;ities: that is, He &s;ees all that Pardon, Peace, Grace and Salvation in Chri&s;t, which, when once obtained, will make the mo&s;t mi&s;e|rable Sinner in the World, happy for|ever; and &s;o depends upon Him alone, as an All-&s;ufficient Saviour, for all that he &s;tands in need of. Again,</P>
<P>'TIS expre&s;s'd in <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.18. by <HI>fleeing for refuge, to lay hold on the Hope &s;et be|fore us.</HI> And this &s;uppo&s;es, That the poor Sinner has, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> a deep &s;en&s;e of the im|minent hazard he is in of being &s;eiz'd by the Ju&s;tice of GOD, and Condemned to Eternal Death, which his Soul trembles at the pro&s;pect of: and <HI>then,</HI> that he has had a di&s;covery of Chri&s;t as the only Saviour from the Wrath to come; and &s;o ha&s;tens away to Him, as the Man-&s;layer of old fled to the City of Refuge, to &s;ave his Life, from the Avenger of Blood that
<PB N="152" REF="003231_0157_0FF02661ABBB4830">
pur&s;ued him. And &s;o lays hold on Chri&s;t and Tru&s;ts in Him&punc; as his only Hope and Refuge. Once more,</P>
<P>'TIS expre&s;s'd by <HI>committing our Souls</HI> into the Hands of CHRIST. 2 Tim. 1.12. <HI>I know</HI> (&s;ays the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul) that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him again&s;t that day.</HI> And agreably, Every poor Sinner has a precious and im|mortal Soul to take care of, and to pro|vide for, again&s;t the Time when it enters into the Eternal World: and it needs to be put into &s;afer Hands than his own. And therefore, the Believer, having &s;een what a merciful and faithful Redeemer Chri&s;t is, he commits his Soul by Faith, and all the Concerns of it, that re&s;pect Eternity, into His Almighty Hands, and hopes that by His infinite Power and Grace He will pre&s;erve it, and bring it forth richly adorn'd with the Robes of Glory at the Great Day. And then,</P>
<P>Finally, THIS Act of Faith is expre&s;s'd by <HI>Leaning</HI> upon Chri&s;t. Cant. 6.5. <HI>Who is this coming out of the wilderne&s;s, leaning upon her beloved.</HI> The&s;e words have doubtle&s;s a re&s;pect to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and true Believers on Him. Chri&s;t is the <HI>Be|loved One</HI> here &s;poken of, and true Be|lievers are they that come out of the wil|derne&s;s <HI>leaning upon him.</HI> And here we
<PB N="153" REF="003231_0158_0FF0266336389D80">
have (1.) The natural Condition of a Sin|ner de&s;cribed to us: 'Tis a <HI>wilderne&s;s</HI> &s;tate. i. e. a lo&s;t, indigent and di&s;con&s;o|late &s;tate. And (2.) The Believers Reli|ance upon Chri&s;t to bring him out of this &s;ad Condition: expre&s;s'd by <HI>leaning</HI> upon Him. And accordingly, every true Be|liever, that is &s;en&s;ible of his lo&s;t e&s;tate by Nature, has al&s;o &s;een that there is no one can direct and lead him out of it but Je|&s;us Chri&s;t. And being ready to faint and die under the Apprehen&s;ions of his &s;ad Condition, He lays hold on Chri&s;t by Faith, as one that is faint lays hold on the fir&s;t Support he can meet with: and here he depends, both for Wi&s;dom to direct, and for Strength to help him along thro' the Darkne&s;s and Difficulties that lie be|fore him. And this proves a Cordial to his fainting Soul.</P>
<P>AND now from the&s;e, and &s;uch like Expre&s;&s;ions, whereby the Act of Reliance upon Chri&s;t is de&s;cribed to us, we may ea&s;ily gather, that the Nature of it con|&s;i&s;ts in the Soul's <HI>Adventuring it &s;elf by Faith upon Chri&s;t alone, for all that Sal|vation it needs.</HI> And &s;o, on the one Hand, it &s;huts out all <HI>Confidence in others,</HI> either in <HI>whole</HI> or in <HI>part.</HI> And &s;ays to Chri&s;t at they did, I&s;ai. 26.23. <HI>O Lord

our God, other Lords be&s;ides thee, have had dominion over us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name.</HI> And as they, in P&s;al. 20.7. <HI>Some tru&s;ts in chariots, and &s;ome in hor&s;es: but we will remember the name of the Lord our God.</HI> And on the other hand, it &s;huts out that black and raging <HI>De&s;pair,</HI> which &s;ome Reprobates have gone out of the World under the Angui&s;h of; as <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Judas</HI> did.</P>
<P>INDEED this Act of Reliance is not al|ways &s;o <HI>Strong</HI> and full of <HI>Comfort</HI> as the Saint could wi&s;h for; and as &s;ome Belie|vers have had experience of. For in &s;ome it has grown up to <HI>full A&s;&s;urance;</HI> as it did in the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> as we find, in the forecited 2 Tim. 1.12. <HI>I know</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>whom I have believed, and am per&s;wa|ded,</HI> or a&s;&s;ured, <HI>that he is able,</HI> and willing too, <HI>to keep that which I have committed to him again&s;t that day.</HI> And the like we read concerning many more of the Saints in Scripture. But in many others this Act of Faith runs at a very low ebb in|deed. It does &s;o in mo&s;t on their fir&s;t Believing in Chri&s;t; "and &s;ometimes a great while after, in an Hour of &s;piritual Darkne&s;s and Di&s;tre&s;s". But then, when the true Believer is reduced to the great|e&s;t Straits in his own Mind, and que&s;tions
<PB N="155" REF="003231_0160_0FF0266806DC5900">
whether he has the lea&s;t degree of &s;av|ing Faith in him, he is wont to expre&s;s his Humble Reliance upon CHRIST by Faith after this manner,</P>
<P><HI>O LORD, I am in a mo&s;t mi&s;erable lo&s;t Condition by Nature. My Sins are many and greatly Aggravated. I de&s;erve thy dreadful Wrath and Vengeance on the ac|count of them: and I am afraid I &s;hall pe|ri&s;h forever under the intollerable weight of my Sin and Guilt. But I find, in thy Holy Word, with Thee there is Mercy, and with Thee there is plenteous Redemption, that thou may&s;t be feared. And thou ha&s;t &s;hown forth the Riches of thy Grace, in providing an Almighty Saviour for peri&s;h|ing Sinners; yea, even for the chief of Sin|ners; &s;uch as I have ju&s;t rea&s;on to account my &s;elf. But whether I have yet an In|tere&s;t in Him, or am ever like to obtain one, I am &s;adly at a lo&s;s. I meet with all manner of di&s;couragements in the way, both from within and from without. Within I have a wicked and deceitful Heart, that oppo&s;es all that is good, and I am &s;urround|ed with Spiritual Enemies, who are much too hard for me in my own &s;trength; and I fear I &s;hall one day fall and peri&s;h by the hands of them. But, LORD, Thou can&s;t help me if thou plea&s;e&s;t; and I &s;ee eno' in thy CHRIST for my Relief and Salvation.
<PB N="156" REF="003231_0161_0FF0266A69062E98">
Oh, that I cou'd once obtain a &s;aving Inter|e&s;t in Him! Well, I will make what ha&s;te I can towards him, tho' I fear I &s;hall pe|ri&s;h in the way: I am re&s;olved, for this once, to try what Almighty, Sovereign Grace</HI> can <HI>and</HI> will <HI>do. And what tho' I am the vile&s;t Sinner that ever was, and de|&s;erve the very Hotte&s;t Place in Hell; yet, will not thy Mercy be &s;o much the more magnify'd in my Salvation? Yea, LORD, it will: and Heaven will ring for ever with the Prai&s;es of it. I will therefore venture into thy Pre&s;ence: I have no whi|ther el&s;e to go; and I will humbly ca&s;t my &s;elf down at the Feet of thy Merry, and wait upon thee for thy Mercy in Him. If I don't do this, I know I mu&s;t Peri&s;h for|ever: for I am &s;ure there is no other Savi|our but CHRIST; nor any other way to Salvation but by Him. And if I do this; who knows but there may be Mercy in &s;tore for me. But if not, I can but Peri&s;h after all. And if I do Peri&s;h, it &s;hall be at the Foot of Mercy. Yea,</HI> I will tru&s;t in the LORD tho' he &s;lay me.</P>
<P>THIS is the Language of a poor Soul relying upon Chri&s;t by Faith, when 'tis fill'd with the greate&s;t Darkne&s;s and Di|&s;tre&s;s about its everla&s;ting State and Con|dition. And by this means the Believer is kept, at &s;uch times, from falling into
<PB N="157" REF="003231_0162_0FF0266C027FC928">
utter De&s;pair. And now, tho' this be a very uncomfortable &s;tate, for any one to be in; yet, every one that thus <HI>relies</HI> up|on Chri&s;t in his Di&s;tre&s;s, is in a &s;afe Con|dition. For the&s;e are the Breathings of true Faith. And if he does but "conti|nue thus looking towards Chri&s;t, wait|ing upon him, and re&s;igning to him, he &s;hall be dealt with as a true Believer." And tho' he may &s;eem to him&s;elf to have no Faith, and others may think he has but little of it; yet, &s;ince his Faith bears &s;ome proportion to his Di&s;couragements, which are evidently great, his Faith al&s;o mu&s;t be great, when it can thus prevail over them.</P>
<P>AND thus I have &s;hewn you how or after what manner a poor Convinced Sin|ner mu&s;t clo&s;e in with Chri&s;t, and rely upon him by Faith, that &s;o he may be &s;aved by him. And now that you may obtain this Faith from GOD; (For as I told you before, Faith is <HI>a Grace of the Holy Spirit,</HI> and <HI>the gift of GOD</HI> to tho&s;e that have it) and be able to exerci&s;e it to the &s;aving of the Soul, you mu&s;t wait upon GOD for the Be&s;towment of it, in the u&s;e of Appointed Means. That is, you mu&s;t give your <HI>Careful</HI> and <HI>Diligent Attendance to the Word,</HI> for this End. You mu&s;t improve all the Opportunities you
<PB N="158" REF="003231_0163_0FF026705DF046B0">
well can to read the Word in Private, and to hear the Word Publickly di&s;pen|&s;ed to you. For &s;ays the Apo&s;tle in Rom. 10.17. <HI>Faith comes by hearing, and hear|ing by the word of God.</HI> And then be|&s;ides, you mu&s;t <HI>Pray humbly</HI> and <HI>earne&s;t|ly</HI> to GOD to be&s;tow this Grace upon you. For &s;ince 'tis the <HI>Gift</HI> of GOD, He ju&s;tly expects to be &s;ought unto for it: And &s;ince 'tis &s;o eminent and u&s;eful a Grace, as we are all of us ready to own, we can never be too importunate in our Supplications to GOD for it.</P>
<P>AND if by the&s;e Means you can but obtain Faith, as no doubt you may; and can but exerci&s;e it in Receiving and Re|lying upon Chri&s;t, as you have heard; you will certainly obtain Eternal Salva|tion in this way. For this Faith in the very <HI>Condition of the New Covenant</HI> on Man's part, and gives the Sinner an Inte|re&s;t in Chri&s;t, and a Title to that Salvati|on which He has purcha&s;ed and wrought out for poor Sinners. And therefore, by the Grace of GOD, we are &s;aid <HI>to be &s;aved by Faith,</HI> Eph. 2.8. And then be&s;ides, this Faith has, many times over, the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> and <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> of Eternal Salvation made unto it. But this one place may &s;erve in&s;tead of all at this

time, Joh. 6.40. <HI>And this is the will of him that &s;ent me</HI> (&s;ays our Saviour) <HI>that every one that &s;eeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everla&s;ting life; and I will rai&s;e him up at the la&s;t day.</HI> And therefore, if you have but true Faith, tho' it be but <HI>&s;mall,</HI> like the <HI>grain of mu&s;tard &s;eed,</HI> and but <HI>weak,</HI> like <HI>the brui&s;ed reed;</HI> yet never Fear: You are pa&s;&s;ed from Death to Life, and &s;hall never come in|to Condemnation; but be &s;aved in the Day of Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>AND thus, I have gone thro' the &s;eve|ral general Heads I propo&s;ed to &s;peak to, in An&s;wer to that mo&s;t important Enquiry in the Text, viz. <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI> And have given &s;uch particular Directions under each of them, which if any Sinner in the World, can but find an Heart fully to comply with, Let his pa&s;t Sins and Hazards be what they will, he &s;hall certainly be &s;aved with an Everla&s;ting Salvation.</P>
<P>AND now I &s;hall Conclude this Practi|cal Subject, with a few brief <HI>Reflecti|ons</HI> upon it. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Infer.</HI> MUST we do &s;o many things, as I have &s;aid, to obtain Eternal Salva|tion?
<PB N="160" REF="003231_0165_0FF02676564CB1C8">
Then 'tis not &s;o <HI>ea&s;y</HI> a thing to be &s;aved, as Multitudes in the World are ready to imagine. Indeed, 'tis &s;ad to think what <HI>vain</HI> and <HI>delu&s;ive</HI> thoughts carnally &s;ecure Sinners do forever enter|tain on this Head. But &s;o it is; They don't &s;ee the worth of Eternal Salvation in it &s;elf, nor &s;ee the ab&s;olute need they &s;tand in of it: but prefer the Service of Sin, and the forbid Plea&s;ures of it, to the Service of GOD <HI>here,</HI> and the Enjoyment of Him <HI>forever.</HI> And when, at any time they are put in mind of Death and Eternity, and are call'd upon to prepare for the Happine&s;s of the World to come, They think 'tis the ea|&s;ie&s;t thing they have to do, to provide for it. They think that a few broken Prayers, and a little lifele&s;s Devotion, in <HI>Old-Age,</HI> or upon a <HI>Death-Bed,</HI> when they can no longer enjoy the Plea&s;ures of Sin, will effectually an&s;wer the end: And &s;o wholly lay a&s;ide all their Care and Concern for the pre&s;ent. But, O vain and pre&s;umptuous Sinner, who&s;e Ca&s;e this is, Eternal Salvation is quite another Thing than you have ever yet taken it to be. For, it is of infinite worth in it &s;elf, as you have oft-times heard. And then be&s;ides, 'Tis the <HI>One
<PB N="161" REF="003231_0166_0FF0267A551310B8">
Thing needful</HI> for us; and that without which you are like to be undone to Eter|nity. And as it is &s;o excellent in it&s;elf, and &s;o needful for us, 'tis richly worth all the Labour and Pains&punc; you can take in &s;ecuring an Intere&s;t in it. And accord|ingly, it is not to be obtained at &s;o Cheap a rate as you vainly dream it is. But GOD expects and requires of every one that would be &s;aved, that he make a Bu|&s;ine&s;s of <HI>working out his Salvation;</HI> and the main Bu&s;ine&s;s too of his whole Life. Read and con&s;ider the following Places, Math. 6.33. <HI>Seek fir&s;t the kingdom of God and the righteou&s;ne&s;s thereof.</HI> Luk. 13.24. <HI>Strive to enter in at the &s;trait gate: for many I &s;ay unto you will &s;eek to enter in, and &s;hall not be able.</HI> Phil. 2.12. <HI>Work out your own &s;alvation with fear and trembling.</HI> Rom. 12.11. <HI>Be not &s;lothful in bu&s;ine&s;s; but fervent in &s;pirit; &s;erving the Lord.</HI> And in 2 Pet 1.5. <HI>And be|&s;ides all this, giving all diligence, add to your faith vertue, and to vertue knowledge &amp;c.</HI> And in ver. 10. <HI>Wherefore the rather brethren, give diligence to make your cal|ling and election &s;ure.</HI> And &s;o in many more places: whereby you may plainly &s;ee that GOD calls for the Improvement of all your Time and Strength and Ta|lents in this Important Affair. And
<PB N="162" REF="003231_0167_0FF0267EA0996DB0">
therefore, all &s;uch Sinners as entertain the&s;e light thoughts of Salvation, and think 'tis &s;o ea&s;y a matter to be &s;aved, are certainly great &s;trangers to this Salvati|on: They have no Right or Title at all to it; and are every moment in hazard of falling into the Pit of endle&s;s Perditi|on. For &s;o long as you continue per|ver&s;ely in the &s;tate you are in, de&s;pi&s;ing and neglecting Chri&s;t and his Salvation, tho&s;e awful words may be apply'd to you. Math. 23.33. <HI>Ye &s;erpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye e&s;cape the damnation of hell?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Infer.</HI> MAY Salvation be obtain'd upon &s;uch Terms as we have heard? <HI>How glorious and wonderful does the Grace of GOD appear herein?</HI> Eternal Salva|tion contains &s;o many great and excellent Things in it, as you heard in a former Di&s;cou&s;e, that there appears to be an in|finite worth and value in it. And by Con&s;equence, there can be no propor|tion between the Gift of this Salvation, and what GOD requires we &s;hould do for the obtainment of it; and &s;o there is a mo&s;t glorious Di&s;play of Divine Grace, in the offer and Grant of Salvation upon the&s;e Terms. Indeed, if we con&s;ider all that has been done for the purcha&s;e of
<PB N="163" REF="003231_0168_0FF0268028A1EAA0">
this Salvation, there has been a &s;ufficient Price paid down for it. For Je&s;us Chri&s;t who has undertaken for our Redemption, has &s;hed His mo&s;t precious Blood, and laid down His mo&s;t precious Life, for this End: And this is a Price of infinite value; and &s;o worth all the Happine&s;s the Believer can po&s;&s;ibly come to the Enjoyment of: For Chri&s;t was an infi|nite Per&s;on. And, indeed, the Ju&s;tice of GOD Required &s;uch a Satisfaction of our Surety, before He could, with Ho|nour to Him&s;elf, relea&s;e any one Sinner from the Chains of Guilt, and advance Him to the Dignity and Priviledges of His Children. But then, as the Matter concerns us immediately, There is no manner of Proportion, between the weight and worth of Eternal Salvation, and all that GOD Requires and Expects from us, for the obtaining of it. For what are the be&s;t Services we can per|form in this &s;inful State, but mean and imperfect in them&s;elves? And then be&s;ides, the Things which GOD re|quires of us for this End; &s;uch as part|ing with our Sins and Lu&s;ts, which have brought all our Ruine and Mi&s;ery upon us; &mdash; Our turning our feet into the Paths of His Commandments, which carries its own Reward with it; and our

clo&s;ing in with Chri&s;t by Faith, where|by we are brought into a Life of Com|munion with Him: The&s;e Things, I &s;ay, in them&s;elves, tend as much to our own Happine&s;s, as they do to the Honour and Glory of GOD. And yet, The&s;e are all that GOD requires of us that &s;o we may come to enjoy Eternal Life in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Here then is a mo&s;t marvellous Di&s;covery of infinite Grace. And well might the Apo&s;tle &s;ay, as in Eph. 2.8. <HI>By Grace ye are &s;aved.</HI> And this Grace will be the Subject of the Saints Admi|ration and Prai&s;e to Eternity.</P>
<P>But then,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Infer.</HI> HERE is Ground of great Encouragement to every Convinced Sin|ner that is ready to De&s;pair of Salvation. For if Salvation is to be had upon &s;uch Terms as you have heard, then you may have it upon tho&s;e Terms as well as any el&s;e. And to make you &s;en&s;ible of it, I &s;hall offer two Things briefly to your Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="1">1. 'TIS a very <HI>Remarkable</HI> Day of Salvation with you, and the Offer of Salvation is <HI>immediately</HI> made you. This your pre&s;ent Hears and Jealou&s;ies make
<PB N="165" REF="003231_0170_0FEFD96C9E357988">
you to call in que&s;tion: And you are ready to think your Day of Grace is o|ver, and that the Door of Mercy is &s;hut again&s;t you for ever. But, poor Soul, why &s;uch hard thoughts of GOD and His Grace! I am &s;ure thou art infinitely mi&s;taken in them: For GOD has &s;aid the direct contrary in His Holy Word. He has told us all plainly, in 2 Cor. 6.2. <HI>Behold, now is the accepted Time; now is the day of Salvation.</HI> And therefore, there is not one Sinner in this A&s;&s;embly; no, nor one Sinner in the whole World, that has any Knowledge of Chri&s;t, and breathes after an Intere&s;t in Him, as you now do, but GOD is now waiting upon him in a way of Grace; and &s;tands with the Arms of His Mercy open, ready to embrace Him, as &s;oon as ever He gives in the Con&s;ent of his Soul to take Chri&s;t in all His Offices, and upon the Terms of the Go&s;pel. And then be&s;ides, The Offer of Chri&s;t and Salvation by Him, is more immediately directed to you than to any other Sinners in the whole World, that have not yet actually embraced Him. For are you not weary and heavy laden with a &s;en&s;e of your Sins? Then that gracious Invitation and Promi&s;e, is directed to you, as tho' by Name, Mat. 11.28. <HI>Come unto me all ye that labour

and are heavy laden, and I will give you re&s;t.</HI> Again, Don't you thir&s;t and long for an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, and the Grace of the New-Covenant. If &s;o, that gra|cious Invitation is directed to you in par|ticular, Joh. 7.37. &mdash; <HI>If any man thir&s;t, let him come to me and drink.</HI> And that in Rev. 22.17. <HI>And the &s;pirit and bride &s;ay, come. And let him that heareth &s;ay, come. And let him that is a-thir&s;t come: And who&s;oever will, let him take the wa|ter of life freely.</HI> So that you never be|fore had &s;uch a remarkable Sea&s;on of Grace as the pre&s;ent Day is.</P>
<P>And then,</P>
<P N="2">2. GOD <HI>offers</HI> His HOLY SPIRIT to you, to <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;t</HI> you in all that He Requires of you to Salvation. This your pre&s;ent Di&s;tre&s;s makes you to doubt: and you are ready to think you have &s;o long re&s;i&s;ted and grieved the Ble&s;&s;ed Spirit that He has taken His farewell of you. But there is nothing more evident to all that have a right Under&s;tanding of your Ca&s;e, than that the Holy Spirit is now powerfully at Work upon your Heart; and by the Fears and Terrors you are in, He is every Day more and more humbling and emptying you out

of your &s;elf. And if you do but cheri&s;h the&s;e &s;trivings of the Spirit; and are thankful to GOD for them; and earne&s;t|ly cry for the more plentiful Effu&s;ions of it, GOD &s;tands ready to hear and an&s;wer your Reque&s;t. See Luk. 11.13. <HI>If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: How much more &s;hall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?</HI> So that upon the whole, every Convinced and Awakened Sinner, who&s;e Sins are a Burden and Grief to Him, has all the Rea&s;on he can de&s;ire, to lay a&s;ide all De&s;pairing tho'ts of the Mercy of GOD, and to follow the Directions that have been &s;et before him; and in this way to Hope for Eternal Life.</P>
<P>And now,</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Infer.</HI> WHAT we have heard &s;hould Awaken all Carele&s;s and Secure Sinners, and &s;tir them up to Inquire and Seek in earne&s;t after Eternal Salva|tion. You have heard what this Salva|tion implies in it, and how nece&s;&s;ary 'tis for you. And can any thing more be &s;aid to awaken and rou&s;e, and fill you with Concern about it? You have al&s;o heard what Cour&s;e you mu&s;t take
<PB N="168" REF="003231_0173_0FF0268A81AC92D8">
if you intend ever to obtain it. And can't you be prevail'd upon yet to fall in with the&s;e gracious Directions? which are all plainly laid before you in the Word of GOD. Well then, I have but two Things more to offer to your Con&s;ideration; and &s;o mu&s;t leave you to the Mercy or Judgment of GOD.</P>
<P N="1">1. WHILE you continue in your pre|&s;ent carele&s;s and wilful neglect of Sal|vation, you every Day run further from it, and ripen more and more for the Damnation of Hell. For while you keep out of the narrow Way which leads to Life, you are in the Broad Way that leads to De&s;truction: and Satan and your own Lu&s;ts hurry you down Hill towards the Pit of endle&s;s and irremedile&s;s Mi&s;ery. And therefore, tho&s;e awful Words are &s;poken to you, and &s;uch as you are, Rom. 2.4, 5. <HI>Thou de&s;pi&s;e&s;t the riches of his goodne&s;s, and forbearance, and long-&s;uffering; not know|ing that the goodne&s;s of God leadeth thee to repentance. But after thy hardne&s;s and impenitent heart trea&s;ure&s;t up unto thy &s;elf wrath again&s;t the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="003231_0174_0FF0268C1D0DF530">And then,</P>
<P N="2">2. Con&s;ider, YOUR Day of Grace <HI>pa&s;&s;es &s;wiftly away,</HI> and will quickly come to <HI>an end</HI> with you. Your Days are like a &s;hadow that quickly pa&s;&s;eth away; and you can have but a little while, at the longe&s;t, to live in the World; and you may Die before the Light of another Morning advances up|on us. And whenever you Die, whether &s;ooner or later, this will put an ever|la&s;ting Period to your Day of Grace. And if your Salvation is not then pro|vided for, you will be undone to Eternity, and the Damnation of Hell mu&s;t be your Everla&s;ting Portion. Oh, Then, <HI>awake thou that &s;leepe&s;t, and a|ri&s;e from the Dead,</HI> ari&s;e quickly, <HI>that Chri&s;t may give thee life.</HI> And hearken to that compa&s;&s;ionate Call that is now renewed unto you, Ezek. 18.31, 32. <HI>Ca&s;t away from you all your Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, wherewith ye have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, and make you a new heart, and a new &s;pirit; for why will ye die,</HI> O mi&s;era|ble Sinner? <HI>For I have no plea&s;ure in the death of him that dieth, &s;aith the LORD GOD: wherefore turn your &s;elves, and live ye.</HI> And to all that are
<PB N="170" REF="003231_0175_0FF02691095F71D0">
willing to do &s;o, I will leave that word of Encouragement, with which I con|clude the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es, I&s;ai. 55.6, 7. <HI>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near. Let the wicked for&s;ake his way, and the un|righteous man his thoughts; and let him turn to the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</HI> AMEN.</P>
