<P>TO be ever re&s;tle&s;s and di&s;&s;atisfied, is natural to man|kind; and this di&s;po&s;ition impells us to &s;eek plea|&s;ure in variety, and happine&s;s in &s;omething unpo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. That de&s;irable &s;omething none ever attain, but all find amu&s;ement in its pur&s;uit. Our time being thus engaged and our pa&s;&s;ions employed, we pa&s;s through life in a continual agitation, and often enjoy in idea, what Prov|idence
<PB N="4" REF="027335_0003_0FD40AF30E8D24B8">
never permits us to ta&s;te in reality, during the period of our mortal exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Nor is it &s;it we &s;hould be entirely happy in this world, for if we were, we &s;hould think of no other; and the nece&s;&s;ary thoughts of futurity would be &s;acrificed to the pre&s;ent enjoyments; permanent ble&s;&s;ings would be for|got in the captivating charms of tran&s;itory plea&s;ures; and mankind lo&s;t to active bli&s;s, would place all their happine&s;s in a &s;erene apathy, and find their greate&s;t lux|ury in lazine&s;s.</P>
<P>But Providence, very wi&s;ely, to prevent the whole world from <HI>running to ru&s;t,</HI> if I may be allowed the ex|pre&s;&s;ion, hath implanted in our natures a perpetual de&s;ire of change; an impul&s;ive principle which renders the &s;ame objects &s;atiating, and the &s;ame &s;ituations irk&s;ome. It is this principle which hath occa&s;ioned the ri&s;e and fall of empires in all ages, and furni&s;hed the materials for all the hi&s;tories and biographical productions that ever were written. This hath impelled to the mo&s;t im|portant di&s;coveries, and the noble&s;t atchievements; and a more than ordinary &s;hare of this fire of impatience or active principle, is what forms the hero, philo&s;opher, poet, or any other character which renders it&s;elf &s;ingu|lar, or performs what is remarkable. Thus we may perceive, if order is heaven's fir&s;t law, action is its, great|e&s;t agent.</P>
<P>But though this active principle is diffu&s;ed through the whole human race, yet it has not a &s;imilar operation in every individual; we find many who&s;e natures are more heterogeneous, and who&s;e imaginations are more eccen|tric than the generality of mankind. It is the actions of &s;uch that furni&s;h entertainment for the more phlegmatic, the more fedate, or the more &s;edentary part of the crea|tion. Mr. Pope very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that
<Q><L>Mo&s;t &s;ouls, 'tis true, but peep out once an age,</L>
<L>Dull &s;ullen pri&s;oners in the body's cage,</L>
<L>Dim lights of life that burn a length of years,</L>
<L>U&s;ele&s;s, un&s;een, as lamps in &s;epulchres,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="027335_0004_0FD40AF673743208">Like ea&s;tern kings a lazy &s;tate they Keep,</L>
<L>And clo&s;e confin'd in their own palace &s;leep.</L></Q></P>
<P>Such form the bulk of mankind, who, if they can in the lea&s;t vary their daily amu&s;ements, never wi&s;h to change the place of their re&s;idence. Their pa&s;&s;ions are dome&s;tic, their curio&s;ity limited, and the daily occurren|ces which may happen in the cour&s;e of their bu&s;ine&s;s, or in the circle of their acquaintance, is all the variety they de&s;ire to know. The &s;trange and furprizing they are content to take at &s;econd hand, and being perfectly &s;at|isfied with reading and hearing of things that are uncom|mon, they never wi&s;h to run any hazard in &s;eeing or knowing experimentally what others relate. The actions of &s;uch are &s;o little intere&s;ting, that a recital of their lives would appear extremely in&s;ipid and unentertaining.</P>
<P>But we may naturally expect a fund of amu&s;ement, as well as in&s;truction from the authentic memoirs of &s;uch who&s;e lives have been a continual &s;cene of variety. Who&s;e active &s;pirits have perpetually impelled them to a change of place, as well as &s;entiments, and the great|ne&s;s of who&s;e &s;ouls, &s;corning to be prejudiced by vulgar cu&s;toms, tran&s;mitted by received opinions, or bia&s;s'd by common &s;y&s;tems, hath led them to &s;earch for happine&s;s, or &s;eek amu&s;ement in various countries and in different capacities.</P>
<P>We have no doubt but as the extraordinary character of the late honourable Mr. Wortley Montague hath ex|cited curio&s;ity in many nations, and among all ranks of people, that it will prove infinitely agreeable to the pub|lic, to lay before them an authentic narrative of his re|remarkable travels, entertaining adventures, and &s;ingular amours, which having all the merit of fact, are at the &s;ame time &s;o &s;urprizing as to exceed the mo&s;t celebrated productions of fiction.</P>
<P>But as this re&s;tle&s;s and uncommon phaenomenon was the &s;on of a lady, who&s;e per&s;onal and mental accompli&s;h|ments have made a great noi&s;e in the world, and who&s;e various adventures were likewi&s;e very extraordinary, it
<PB N="6" REF="027335_0005_0FD40AF7E331DF58">
may not be ami&s;s to preface the life of Mr. Montague, by mentioning a few particulars relative to his noble mother. This &s;eems the more nece&s;&s;ary, as a very re|markable circum&s;tance previous to his birth, and which was indeed the <HI>primitive cau&s;e of his exi&s;tence,</HI> &s;eems &s;o intimately connected with the&s;e memoirs, that we could not with propriety begin them without it.</P>
<P>Some time in the year 1716, the celebrated Lady Mary Wortley Montague &s;et out with her hu&s;band, who was appointed to go to Con&s;tantinople in a public capa|city, for that famous city.</P>
<P>They proceeded through Holland, Germany, Hunga|ry, &amp;c. to the place of their de&s;tination: the particulars of their journey and the principal curio&s;ities of the places through which they pa&s;&s;ed, are frequently de|&s;cribed by the lady her&s;elf in a cour&s;e of admirable letters written to many per&s;ons of the fir&s;t di&s;tincton.</P>
<P>In a letter written at Vienna, dated Sept. 20, 1716, &s;he &s;ays, &s;peaking of the ladies of that court, <Q>I have not &s;een any &s;uch prudes as to pretend fidelity to their hu&s;|bands, who are certainly the be&s;t natured &s;et of people in the world, and took upon their wive's gallants as fa|vourably as men do upon their deputies that take the trouble&s;ome part of their bu&s;ine&s;s off their hands.</Q></P>
<P>In what light this lady might hold that part of prudery called cha&s;tity, or how &s;he might e&s;timate her hu&s;band's temper, we cannot pretend to &s;ay; a little farther how|ever, &s;he in&s;inuates, that &s;he had not imbibed the Au&s;|trian cu&s;toms, by telling us the following tale: <Q>One of the plea&s;ante&s;t adventures I ever met with in my life, was la&s;t night; and it will give you a ju&s;t idea in what a delicate manner the <HI>belles pa&s;&s;ions</HI> are managed in this country; I was at the a&s;&s;emply of the counte&s;s of&mdash;, and the young count of&mdash;, lead|ing me down &s;tairs, a&s;ked me how long I was to &s;tay at Vienna; I made an&s;wer that my &s;tay depended on the emperor, and it was not in my power to determine it.
<PB N="7" REF="027335_0006_0FD40AF91BEDAC68">
Well, Madam, (&s;aid he) whether your time here is to be longer or &s;horter, I think you ought to pa&s;s it agree|ably, and to that end you mu&s;t engage in a little affair of the heart. My heart, (an&s;wered I, gravely enough) does not engage very ea&s;ily, and I have no de&s;ign of parting with it. I &s;ee, Madam, (&s;aid he, &s;ighing,) by the ill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ure of that an&s;wer, that I am not to hope for it, which is a great mortification to me that am charm|ed with you; but however, I am &s;till devoted to your &s;ervice, and &s;ince I am not worthy of entertaining you my&s;elf, do me the honour of letting me know whom you like be&s;t among&s;t us, and I'll engage to manage the affair entirely to your &s;atisfaction. You may judge in what manner I &s;hould have received this compli|ment in my own country, but I was well enough ac|quainted with this to know that he really intended me an obligation; and I thanked him with a very grave courte&s;y, and only a&s;&s;ured him, that I had no occa&s;ion to make u&s;e of it.</Q></P>
<P>Now, if this be fact, and who would be &s;o impolite as to doubt the veracity of a lady, in &s;uch a ca&s;e e&s;pecially, what conclu&s;ion mu&s;t the mind, acquainted with her lady|&s;hip's character draw? We mu&s;t naturally conjecture that either the abruptne&s;s or indelicacy of the addre&s;s, or the per&s;on from whom it came, di&s;plea&s;ed her, or that &s;he certainly was, as &s;he &s;ays in a &s;ub&s;equent letter of the 26th of the &s;ame month, <Q>already infected with the phlegm of the country,</Q> for it is mo&s;t certain that the prolific and warm climate of Turkey greatly altered her lady&s;hip's &s;entiments &s;oon after, and rendered her not quite &s;o &s;crupulous and phlegmatic.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be con&s;e&s;&s;ed, that if &s;he had even <HI>a little a&s;|fair of the heart,</HI> it would have impeached her under|&s;tanding to have con&s;e&s;&s;ed it, as not to have informed her fair corre&s;pondent that &s;he had been addre&s;&s;ed by a lover, would have &s;eemed a tacit confe&s;&s;ion that her charms had been neglected; an idea which her lady|&s;hip's natural vanity could not on any account &s;uffer to take root.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II. <HI>Continuation of Remarks on the before mentioned Let|ters. &mdash;Some curious inferences.&mdash;A &s;ingular Detec|tion in a very &s;ingular Circum&s;tance.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE celebrated lady mentioned in the la&s;t chapter, might, with propriety, be termed the <HI>Sapho</HI> of the pre&s;ent century. In point of per&s;onal charms, &s;he eclip|&s;ed the Grecian pocte&s;s, and was her equal, if not her &s;uperior, with re&s;pect to the elegance of her wit, and her love of re&s;inement in the mo&s;t voluptuous plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>We &s;hould not have taken the liberty to make re|marks on letters which art to be admired for the ele|gance of their compo&s;ition, and the accuracy of their information, nor to have &s;crutinized the conduct of a lady, who&s;e great abilities we venerate, and who&s;e faults none were to an&s;wer for but her&s;elf, had not our &s;ub|ject, and truth rendered &s;uch crititical inquiries ab&s;o|utely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Though the lady her&s;elf, or her friends who publi&s;h|ed her letter&s; after her death, took infinite pains not to betray &s;ecrets, yet circum&s;tances that have &s;ince tran&s;|pired, and &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in the epi&s;tles them&s;elves, have given foundation to more than bare &s;urmi&s;e.</P>
<P>What are we to think of the expre&s;&s;ions u&s;ed in de|&s;cribing her vi&s;it to the lovely <HI>Fatima,</HI>the <HI>Thabya's</HI> lady when her young dam&s;els are ordered to dance before our modern <HI>Sapho</HI>?</P>
<P><Q>This dance (&s;he &s;ays) was very different from what I had &s;een before: nothing can be more artful, or more proper to rai&s;e <HI>certain ideas,</HI> the tunes &s;o &s;o&s;t, the motions &s;o langui&s;hing, accompanied with pau&s;es and dying eyes, half falling back, and then recovering them&s;elves in &s;o artful a manner, that I am very po&s;|itive, the colde&s;t and mo&s;t rigid prude upon earth could
<PB N="9" REF="027335_0008_0FD40AFC294CEBF8">
not have looked upon them without thinking of <HI>&s;ome|thing not to be &s;poken of.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Does not the &s;oul of the lady &s;peak in the&s;e words? Warmed by the &s;ubject, her inclination appears without di&s;gui&s;e; her prudence is lo&s;t in pa&s;&s;ion, that frigid turn of thinking contracted in the dominions of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tna, &s;eems to have vani&s;hed before the captivating &s;oft mu&s;ic, and langui&s;hing dances of the Turki&s;h <HI>harams.</HI> We have no doubt but the&s;e &s;oft and foothing incen|tives might overcome the purer re&s;olutions which her cooler rea&s;on might have wi&s;hed to cheri&s;h. And that aided by &s;ach blandi&s;hments, <HI>that</HI> love in&s;piring climate had &s;acrificed &s;entiment at the throne of &s;en&s;ation, and by giving birth to certain ideas had &s;timulated the fair voluptuary to <HI>&s;omething not to be &s;poken of.</HI></P>
<P>In her 43d letter, &s;he again &s;ays, <Q>it is certain what we <HI>feel</HI> and <HI>&s;ee</HI> is properly (if any thing is properly) our own; but the good of &s;ame, the folly of prai&s;e, are hardly purcha&s;ed, and when obtained, poor recom|pen&s;e for the lo&s;s of time and health. We die, or grow old before we can reap the fruit of our labours; con&s;idering what &s;hort-liv'd weak animals men are, is there any &s;tudy &s;o beneficial as the &s;tudy of pre&s;ent plea&s;ure?</Q></P>
<P>Is it not naturally to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that a per&s;on who held out &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem as rational, and &s;eemed &s;o fond of the theory, would adopt the practical part, and mi&s;s no pre&s;ent opportunity of enjoying a more &s;ub&s;tantial &s;atisfaction, than what would accrue from the mere intel|lectual plea&s;ures of platonic gratification.</P>
<P>In another place &s;he informs us that &s;he is no enemy to plea&s;ure <Q>when it is properly &s;ea&s;oned, and of a good compo&s;ition.</Q></P>
<P>The above pa&s;&s;ages are &s;ufficient to evince the nature of the lady's ideas, and the bent of her inclinations.</P>
<P>We do not wi&s;h to build upon what has been re|ported
<PB N="10" REF="027335_0009_0FD40AFE0248B398">
of her by <HI>common fame,</HI> as <HI>common fame</HI> is cer|tainly a very great <HI>magni&s;ier of facts,</HI> as well as <HI>inventor of fal&s;ehoods.</HI> Without therefore recurring to the ex|aggerations of the chronicles of &s;caindal or &s;pleen, if the public only believe a fiftieth part of what hath been a&s;&s;erted concerning this remarkable per&s;onage, it will be &s;ufficient to corroborate what we mean to advance.</P>
<P>This lady in her writings frequently in&s;inuates that &s;he never &s;aw the in&s;ide of the imperial <HI>&s;eraglio</HI>; yet &s;he tells as, that &s;he was informed by the <HI>Sultana Hafiten</HI> favorite of the <HI>Emperor Mu&s;tapha</HI> who was depo&s;ed, <Q>that the &s;tory of the Sultan's throwing a handkerchief is altogether fabulous, and the manner upon that oc|ca&s;ion no other than this; He &s;ends the <HI>Ky&s;ter Age</HI> to &s;ignify to the lady the honour he intends her, &s;he is immediately complimented upon it by the others, and led to the bath, where &s;he is per&s;umed and dre&s;|&s;ed in the mo&s;t magnificent and becoming manner; the emperor precedes his vi&s;it by a royal pre&s;ent, and then comes into her apartment. Neither is there any &s;uch thing as her creeping in at the bed's foot. Sometimes the Sultan diverts him&s;elf in the company of all his ladies, who &s;tand in a circle around him; when they were ready to die with envy and jealou&s;y of the <HI>happy &s;he,</HI> that he di&s;tingui&s;hed by any appear|ance of preference.</Q></P>
<P>We are &s;orry to be under the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of not a&s;&s;enting implicitly to what is advanced by a lady, but the character of a <HI>faithful biographer,</HI> and a &s;trict adherence to facts render a contrary conduct ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>We cannot condemn our modern <HI>Sapho</HI> for the pru|dent concealment of an error, which perhaps was not intentional; but we mu&s;t beg leave to &s;ay that the Sul|tana <HI>Hafiten</HI> did not tell her the above particulars.</P>
<P>This may &s;eem a bold a&s;&s;ertion, but there is the &s;tronge&s;t pre&s;umption of its being a fact, for the <HI>Otto|mans</HI> of both &s;exes would &s;ooner lo&s;e their lives than re|veal

veal to any one, upon any occa&s;ion whatever, the mo&s;t tri&s;ling circum&s;tance relative to their policy or internal management of their <HI>&s;eraglios</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">None but the imperial rece&s;&s;es of &s;en&s;uality are called &s;eraglios, all others are teamed harauns.</NOTE> or <HI>harams,</HI> as they hold all <HI>connubial &s;ecrets &s;acred.</HI></P>
<P>We give the lady the credit of being a plea&s;ing, as well as an elegant writer, and of de&s;cribing things in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mo&s;t &s;triking, and minute manner.

<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER III. <HI>The Amba&s;&s;ador taken ill.&mdash;His Lady's behaviour.&mdash; Amorous Propen&s;ity of the Turki&s;h Ladies.&mdash;Facility of intriguing in Turkey&mdash;The &s;ingular Adventures of the Seraglio.&mdash;Its con&s;equences,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE hu&s;band of our modern <HI>Sapho</HI> had not been long at Con&s;tantinople, before he was attacked by a kind of malignant di&s;order, which confined him for &s;ome weeks to his bed, and for &s;ome months to his chamber.</P>
<P>His lady behaved with great re&s;pect, and indeed ten|derne&s;s during his illne&s;s; but &s;he was neither &s;o pa&s;|&s;ionately tender as to fall &s;ick to keep him company, nor &s;o doatingly fond as to become his nur&s;e.</P>
<P>She knew that there were plenty of tho&s;e about him who were much better qualified than her&s;elf to pre&s;cribe remedies, or admini&s;ter nece&s;&s;aries to him. Knowing therefore that the utmo&s;t human care was taken of him. &s;he left the event to Providence with &s;ingular re&s;ignation, and, gave way to the propen&s;ities natural to her di&s;po&s;i|tion; that is, &s;he pur&s;ued knowledge with unwearied
<PB N="12" REF="027335_0011_0FD40B0161F04F08">
diligence, and then to &s;o&s;ten the &s;everity of her &s;tudies, fought the relaxation of the amu&s;ements and plea&s;ures of the ca&s;t, or took every means to gratify her curio&s;ity, which was exce&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>She had frequently intimated a &s;trong de&s;ire to gain admi&s;&s;ion into the imperial <HI>&s;eraglio,</HI> that &s;he might be|hold the internal wonders of that celebrated place. But all whom &s;he ever mentioned this to, repre&s;ented the thing as impo&s;&s;ible, except a Jew merchant, who informed her, that &s;uch favour he believed, might be procured, but the utmo&s;t privacy and precaution mu&s;t be u&s;ed.</P>
<P>Eager to gratify her curio&s;ity, &s;he did not recur to con&s;equences, and &s;timulated by the idea, perhaps mixed with vanity, of beholding &s;o remarkable a place, from which all except tho&s;e doomed to re&s;ide there, were ex|cluded, &s;he did not give her&s;elf time to reflect on a &s;tep, if not dangerous, at lea&s;t indi&s;creet.</P>
<P>It may not be here ami&s;s to mention, that &s;oon after her arrival at Con&s;tantinople, &s;he a&s;&s;umed the Turki&s;h habit, in order, upon any occa&s;ion to gratify her curio&s;|ity with greater ca&s;e and privacy, and without being no|ticed, as &s;he mu&s;t have been in her own dre&s;s.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the facility of a lady's going undi&s;|covered wherever &s;he plea&s;es in a Turki&s;h dre&s;s, and the ca&s;e with which the females of tho&s;e ea&s;tern countries manage their intrigues, take her own words.</P>
<P><Q>As to their morality, meaning the Turki&s;h ladies, or good conduct, I can &s;ay like Harlequin, that it is ju&s;t as it is with you, and the Turki&s;h ladies, do not commit one &s;in the le&s;s for not being Chri&s;tians. Now that I am a little acquainted with their ways, I cannot forbear admiring either the exemplary di&s;cretion, or extreme &s;tupidity of all the writers that have given an account of them: it is very ca&s;y to &s;ee, they have in reality more liberty than we have; no woman of what rank &s;oever is permitted to go into the &s;treets without two <HI>marlins,</HI> one that covers her face all but her eyes,
<PB N="13" REF="027335_0012_0FD40B049BC30670">
and another, that hides the whole dre&s;s of her head, and hangs half way down her back; their &s;hapes are al&s;o wholly concealed by a thing they call a <HI>ferigce,</HI> which no woman of any &s;ort appears without, this has &s;trait &s;leeves that reach to their &s;ingers' ends, and it laps all around them, not unlike a riding hood; in winter it is of cloth, and in &s;ummer of plain &s;tuff or &s;ilk. You may gue&s;s then, how effectually this di&s;|gui&s;es them, &s;o that there is no di&s;tingu&s;hing the great lady from her &s;lave.

<P>The before mentioned Jew was as good as his word, and in the above dr&s;cribed di&s;gui&s;e &s;he was introduced into the <HI>&s;eraglio</HI> of his &s;ublime higne&s;s, that <HI>&s;anctum &s;anctorum</HI> of voluptuous gratification, and grand repo&s;i|tory of terre&s;trial beauties.</P>
<P>After &s;he had gratified her curio&s;ity by examining the elegance of the apartments, the &s;plendour of the furni|ture, the beauties of the garden, and the charms of the ladies, &s;he was given to under&s;tand that no female was ever permitted to enter that place without being &s;ub&s;er|vient to the inclinations of his &s;ublime highne&s;s; that as it was a ceremonial never di&s;pen&s;ed with, it was expected in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, that it would be complied with without re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Whether the lady made a virtue of nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;ubmitted with a good grace to what &s;he had no power to prevent, whether &s;he affected to expo&s;tulate, yielded with reluctance, or was compelled into a compliance, we cannot pretend to a&s;&s;ert; &s;uffice it to &s;ay, that in the &s;pring of the year 1718, our hero came into the world.</P>

<P>AS young Montague's years increa&s;ed, the &s;hining qualities of his mind were the admiration of all who knew him. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all that elegance of wit and vivacity which di&s;tingui&s;hed his illu&s;trious mother; together with the voluptuous di&s;po&s;ition and love of plea&s;ure that marked the character of the great pei&s;on|age from whom he was always proud to deduce his origin.</P>
<P>At the proper age he was put to We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool, where the brilliancy of his genius, the tenaciou&s;ne&s;s of his memory and quickne&s;s of his penetration attracted the notice of the ma&s;ter of that &s;eminary; while his whim&s;ical temper afforded a continual fund of amu&s;e|ment to the young gentleman who were the companions of his studies.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering his volatile di&s;po&s;ition, he improved amaz|ingly; but a re&s;tle&s;s temper, an impatience of contr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ul, and a roaming de&s;ire &s;eemed to evince them&s;elves in his compo&s;ition. He would frequently ab&s;ent him&s;elf from &s;chool, and make excur&s;ions into the fields for a whole day together, for which he was as often corrected; but correction did not pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent him from repeating his fault, till he had been &s;o often puni&s;hed that che&s;lilement lo&s;t,
<PB N="15" REF="027335_0014_0FD40B074F246F30">
its terrors, and he determined to attempt quitting the &s;chool for ever, let what would be the event.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this determination, he one morn|ing early made an elopement, and wandered about the chief part of the day, wonderfully plea&s;ed with the en|joyment of unre&s;trained liberty.</P>
<P>Hunger at length compelled him to &s;eek &s;ome re|&s;re&s;hment, he immediately repaired to a pa&s;try cook's &s;hop, and gratified his appetite with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat he there thought mo&s;t delicious, a&s;&s;uaging his thim at the &s;ame time with &s;ome whey.</P>
<P>As it was now in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer, and the wea|ther remarkably &s;erene and fine, he never once thought of a place to lodge in at night; however, when it drew toward: evening, he rambled into the fields and very com&s;ortably repo&s;ed him&s;elf upon a hay-cock.</P>
<P>Another day and night pa&s;&s;ed exactly in a &s;imilar <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">anner, and he began to think his new method of pa&s;s|ing his time extremely in&s;ipid, if not tire&s;ome, Not being accommodated with &s;ub&s;tantial food, as cu&s;tomary, indi&s;po&s;ed him very much, and he felt him&s;elf exceed|ingly &s;tiff and full of pain in all his limbs, which he righdy attributed to &s;leeping in the open air.</P>
<P>But another inconvenience appeared to him more di&s;|agreeable than the above, which was, not having any per&s;on to conver&s;e with, or to communicate his thoughts. to; he began to wi&s;h him&s;elf at &s;chool again, or at lea&s;t that he had enticed &s;ome of his &s;chool fellows to elope with him and &s;hare the &s;ame fate as him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He therefore determined to &s;eek &s;ome better accom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> dation than he had had &s;ince his ab&s;enting him&s;elf from &s;chool, in a place of pul he entertainment, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">l near the field that had &s;er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed him as a bed-chamber.</P>
<P>He entered the heu&s;e, and enquired if he could breakfa&s;t thare; the landlady replied he might; but at

the &s;ame time &s;urveyed him with &s;urprize, on account of his youth, a certain noble air which was natural to him, the elegance of his dre&s;s, and the hay which every where hung about his cloaths, and was entangled with his hair.</P>
<P>Break fa&s;t was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">arce over when a hawker brought in a news-paper, and threw it down near where young Montague &s;at.</P>
<P>He took it up in order to amu&s;e him&s;elf; but what Was his confu&s;ion, when ca&s;ting his eyes over it, he found an adverti&s;ement &s;ully de&s;cribing him&s;elf; and offering a reward for &s;eizing and bringing him back again to the &s;chool.</P>
<P>His perplexity was inexpre&s;&s;ible. He fancied the people of the hou&s;e knew the whole affair, and could read the mi&s;demeanor he had been guilty of in his face, and began to be apprehen&s;ive that they were about to &s;eize him, and deliver him up to the ma&s;ter of the &s;em|inary, from which he had eloped.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections alarmed him &s;o much that he a&s;ked what was to pay, in great di&s;order, and being told, threw down the money in ha&s;te, and decamped with the ut|mo&s;t precipitation, frequently looking behind him with the greate&s;t confu&s;ion and terror.</P>
<P>After he had run him&s;elf out of breath, and out of danger, as he fancied, he began to moderate his pace, and to con&s;ider what was to be done in his pre&s;ent dilemma.</P>
<P>While he was ruminating, a chimney &s;weeper's boy appeared in view. A thought immediately &s;truck him, tnat if he &s;hould change his apparel with this boy, who was about his &s;ize, that the dre&s;s of a chimney &s;weeper would effectually di&s;gui&s;e him.</P>
<P>He made the propo&s;al to the boy, who &s;eeing the ele|gance of young Montague's garb, vary readily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;ented
<PB N="17" REF="027335_0016_0FD40B0A5BF618A8">
to a change, which appeared to be &s;o greatly to his own advantage.</P>
<P>They retired to an empty hou&s;e to make the ex|change; which was no &s;ooner effected, than the chim|ney-&s;weeper drily a&s;ked young Montague, if, now he had the dre&s;s, he had a mind to leam the trade?</P>
<P>Montague replied in the affirmative, provided he could have a good ma&s;ter.</P>
<P><Q>As for that (replied young <HI>Sable</HI>) I'll take you to my ma&s;ter, you can't have a better; he'll fill your belly, if he beats your back.</Q></P>
<P>This information did not intimidate young Montague. The idea of commencing chimney-&s;weeper tickled his imagination, and &s;uited exactly with his natural inclina|tion for novelty.</P>
<P>His new comrade immediately conducted him to his ma&s;ter, who was &s;itting by the fire-fide with his wi&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;ingularity of their appearance threw the &s;ooty couple into great con&s;ternation; they could not con|ceive the meaning of &s;uch &s;trange metamorpho&s;es; fig|ure to the imagination a boy as black as &s;oot could make him, dre&s;&s;ed in an elegant &s;uit of light coloured cloaths, white &s;ilk &s;lockings, and a &s;ilver-laced hat, while a comely youth appeared by the &s;ide of him, with a &s;kin as fair as alaba&s;ter, yet clad in the &s;able garments of a chimney-&s;weeper, and who&s;e fine head of hair was cov|ered with a dirty woollen night-cap full of holes.</P>
<P>But their doubts were &s;oon &s;olved by their appren|tice, who informed them of the particulars of the whole affair, and of young Montague's de&s;ire to commence a brother of the bru&s;h.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter immediately con&s;ented to receive him as one of the fraternity, and to initiate him in the my&s;te|ries of the profe&s;&s;ion. But deeming our hero's cloaths
<PB N="18" REF="027335_0017_0FD40B0C53FA2E78">
to be too good a prize for his boy, he determined to con|vert them to his own u&s;e: Therefore, ordering the boy to &s;trip, he gave him the &s;ame kind of apparel as he had lately parted from to young Montague, and promi&s;ed to keep the others &s;afely for him, till he was out of his time.</P>

<P>DISAGREEABLE as this dirty profe&s;&s;ion may &s;eem, young Montague grew fond of it; and be|came &s;o great a proficient in the &s;ooty bu&s;ine&s;s, that his ma&s;ter was very nappy in having met with him.</P>
<P>Add to this, his comical humours and whirn&s;ical ways diverted all that he came near; &s;o that wherever he went to &s;weep chimneys he was &s;ure to be well treated, and often had money given him as a recom|pence. for the mirth he occa&s;ioned; this money he con|&s;tantly &s;pent upon his &s;able comrades, which made them exceedingly fond of his company, and always ready to oblige him: thus he lived much happier than the idea of &s;uch an employment could permit one to &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P>A publican who was an acquaintance and neighbour of his ma&s;ter, had &s;ome company in his hou&s;e one even|ing, who refu&s;ed to leave the hou&s;e when he wanted to retire to re&s;t.</P>
<P>They were in a back parlour pretty much intoxica|ted, and bu&s;ily employed in gaming: a large &s;um of money was depo&s;ited on the table, dependent on the play; while the effects of the liquor tney had drank, with the eagerne&s;s and anxiety on account of their
<PB N="19" REF="027335_0018_0FD40B0DC9737AB8">
&s;takes, occa&s;ioned them frequently to utter the mo&s;t bit|ter imprecations.</P>
<P>The landlord expo&s;tulated with them in vain, they po&s;itively refu&s;ed either to quit the hou&s;e or cea&s;e from &s;wearing.</P>
<P>At length it came into the landlord's head to apply to our hero's ma&s;ter for one of his boys to execute a &s;cheme which he had conceived.</P>
<P>Young Montague was &s;ent with him: he led him into a room adjoining to that in which the game&s;ters were at play, and directed him to a&s;cend the chimney there and de&s;cend through that which belonged to the parlour where they were &s;o bu&s;ily engaged.</P>
<P>Our hero followed his in&s;tructions, and de&s;cended the chimney without their hearing him, when creeping &s;oftly into the mid&s;t of the room unperceived, he &s;ud|denly cried out with a loud voice, "My ma&s;ter Luci|fer has &s;ent me for you all." Hearing the words, they all in&s;tantaneou&s;ly turned their eyes to the place from whence the &s;ound proceeded, and perceiving his &s;able appearance, a general panic &s;eized them, they &s;tarted up &s;uddenly, crowded to the door with the ut|mo&s;t terror, and made their e&s;cape with the greate&s;t precipitation.</P>
<P>This whim&s;ical method of driving away trouble&s;ome campany was attended with the&s;e further good con&s;e|quences. The fright cured every individual of them of the itch for gaming, and the habit of &s;wearing.</P>
<P>As they were too much ternflod to re&s;lect, and in too great a hurry to make their e&s;cape, they never thought of thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> money, which remained on the table, and was &s;eized upon by the landlord and our her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> who divided it equally between them as lawful prize money.</P>
<P>As there was &s;omething whim&s;ical in another of our
<PB N="20" REF="027335_0019_0FD40B0ED097C5B0">
hero's adventures while he remained in the capacity of a chimney-&s;weeper, we &s;hall recite it.</P>
<P>Being &s;ent to &s;weep &s;ome chimneys at a hou&s;e in Golden-Square, he got out of the top of the chimney, and after looking about for &s;ome time from the leads of the hou&s;e, curio&s;ity at length prompted him to de|&s;cend a chimney which belonged to the next hou&s;e.</P>
<P>He de&s;cended into an elegant bed-chamber, where he perceived a fine down bed, which the lady of the hou&s;e had ju&s;t quitted.</P>
<P>As he had lodged but indifferently for &s;ome time pa&s;t, he determined to give his limbs a quarter of an hour's indulgence, by creeping into the lady's place, and covering him&s;elf over head and ears, where he lay for &s;ome time buried in down, and exulting in the &s;ucce&s;s of the whim.</P>
<P>At length a chamber-maid came into the room to make the bed, and place every thing in its proper order.</P>
<P>This girl it &s;eems had for a long time made a prac|tice of &s;tealing her mi&s;tre&s;s's marmalade, and other &s;weetmeats, which were depo&s;ited in a clo&s;et in this bed|chamber, and which the girl got at by means of a &s;al&s;e key &s;he kept for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>According to cu&s;tom &s;he went to the clo&s;et and re|galed her&s;elf as long as &s;he thought proper, with what &s;he fancied the mo&s;t delicious.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he was &s;atisfied, &s;he carele&s;sly approached towards the bed in order to make it, when pulling off the cloaths, up &s;tarted young Montague, who retreated towards the chimney, and &s;crambling up with great ex|pedition and dexterity, got into the next hou&s;e, fini&s;hed him bu&s;ine&s;s, and went home.</P>
<P>As for the poor girl &s;he was &s;o exceedingly terrified, that &s;he gave only one violent &s;eream, and fainted away.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="027335_0020_0FD40B11F3AC60D8">Alarmed by the noi&s;e, the re&s;t of the &s;ervants ran to &s;ee what had occa&s;ioned it.</P>
<P>When they perceived her condition, they u&s;ed their utmo&s;t endeavours to recover her, and &s;oon &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>She had no &s;ooner recovered her recollection, than &s;he ha&s;tened to her mi&s;tre&s;s, and throwing her&s;elf at her feet, with tears in her eyes, implored her forgivene&s;s for the wrong &s;he had done her, confe&s;&s;ing in what man|ner, and how long &s;he had &s;tolen her &s;weetmeats, and delivering up the fal&s;e key with which &s;he had perpetra|ted the crime. At the &s;ame time &s;he &s;olemnly promi|&s;ed never to repeat that or any offence of a &s;imilar na|ture, &s;ince a judgement had befallen her for what &s;he had already done.</P>
<P>She then in a mo&s;t pitiful tone gave an account of the devil's having appeared to her, exaggerating every circum&s;tance, and giving all that dreadful magnitude to the &s;uppo&s;ed apparition, which a terrified imagination could conceive. She declared he was upward of &s;even feet in height, that his eyes were as large as &s;aucers, and as fierce as fire, that blue flames i&s;&s;ued from his mouth and no&s;trils, that his tail was as big as a &s;hip's cable, and his cloven foot, of which &s;he gave a particular de&s;crip|tion, was much larger than the foot of the large&s;t ox. She concluded this mon&s;trous detail by a&s;&s;erting that he vani&s;hed away in a fla&s;h of lightning.</P>
<P>The other &s;ervants corroborated what &s;he &s;aid, in re|&s;pect to &s;ome circum&s;tances, &s;uch as the room and bed being covered with a &s;ort of black dirt, which as they were wonderfully &s;agacious, they &s;uppo&s;ed mu&s;t be <HI>brim|&s;tone a&s;hes</HI>; and the &s;ooty &s;mell they in&s;i&s;ted could proceed from nothing but &s;ulphur.</P>
<P>Whatever the lady thought, &s;he pretended to credit the whole &s;tory, and took an occa&s;ion to give them a lecture on the moral duties, dwelling largely on the old proverb, that <HI>hone&s;ty is the be&s;t policy,</HI> and expatia|ting
<PB N="22" REF="027335_0021_0FD40B13AFA40798">
on the dreadful con&s;equences attending a breach of the <HI>&s;eventh</HI> commandmen</P>
<P>This whim&s;ical adventure however, luckily reformed the girl; who was naturally d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;po&s;ed to pilfer whate|ver came in her way, but the sight ever after rendered her con&s;cientiou&s;ly hone&s;t. Thus many of young Mon|tague's whims, which were infinitely diverting to him&s;elf, became beneficial in the end to others.</P>
<P>As our hero was exceedingly liberal to his &s;able com|rades upon all occa&s;ions, he &s;oon exhau&s;ted not only what money had been given him, but all which he had gained by frightening the game&s;ters.</P>
<P>Many of the chimney-&s;weepers with whom he had contracted an intimacy, de&s;igned to celebrate the en&s;uing 5th of November. They had prepared &s;ome faggots for a bonfire, and purcha&s;ed fire-works according to their re&s;pective abilities.</P>
<P>Our hero, who was naturally ambitious, wi&s;hed to outdo them all, in the article of fire-works, by making a &s;uperior purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>But not having any money left, he determined to gratify his inclination by di&s;po&s;ing of a gold watch, which had formerly been given him by a relation, and which he had not parted with when he changed apparel with the chimney-&s;weeper's boy.</P>
<P>To this end, he went into a watch-maker's &s;hop, without having the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion that he &s;hould meet with any difficulty, and a&s;ked the ma&s;ter of the &s;hop, if he would purcha&s;e a watch.</P>
<P>The watch-maker finding it to be a very valuable one, could not conceive that it came hone&s;tly into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a chimney-&s;weepers boy; in fact, he had no doubt but he had &s;tole it from &s;ome hou&s;e, where he had been employed to &s;weep the chimneys.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="027335_0022_0FD40B14EA08BE00">Full of this idea, he kept young Montague in talk while one of his men fetched a con&s;table, who imme|diately carried him before a magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>Our hero was now frightened out of his wits; in vain he pleaded that it was his own&mdash;the Ju&s;tice &s;o far from beliving him, was about to commit him to goal, that he might be tried for &s;tealing it.</P>
<P>Reduced to this dilemma, he was obliged to con|fe&s;s his birth and family, who he had the watch as a pre&s;ent from, and his elopement from We&s;tmin&s;ter School.</P>
<P>The Ju&s;tice immediately &s;ent an account of the whole tran&s;action to his relations, and the head ma&s;ter of the &s;chool, who all very &s;oon made their appearance.</P>
<P>The magi&s;trate was &s;incerely thanked by his friends&mdash; the ma&s;ter chimney-&s;weeper was &s;ent for, and &s;everely rep|rimanded for having concealed a youth of his appear|ance, in a clande&s;tine manner; and young Montague was again committed to the care of the reverend gen|tleman, who then pre&s;ided over that &s;eminary of learning.</P>
<P>It required a great deal of trouble and a con&s;iderable time to bring his &s;kin to its natural colour again, and to eradicate the particles of &s;oot which had penetrated into the very pores.</P>
<P>As &s;evere methods had been formerly found to be ineffectual with young Montague, his ma&s;ter judiciou&s;ly determined to try what lenient mea&s;ures would do, and therefore, in&s;tead of cha&s;ti&s;ing him for ab&s;enting him|&s;elf from &s;chool, he was forgiven, care&s;&s;ed, and receiv|ed every kind of indulgence.</P>

<P>BUT a di&s;po&s;ition con&s;titutionally volatile, and a mind naturally roving, can only be checked for a time. Such a temper when curbed or re&s;trained, &s;ud|denly breaks out and evinces it&s;elf with a greater de|gree of violence.</P>
<P>Thus our hero, who had behaved pretty circum|&s;pectly for a few months, began again to grow tired of the regularity of &s;chool-di&s;cipline, and to re&s;olve up|on another excur&s;ion without the leave of his preceptor.</P>
<P>His imagination had lately been fired by the accounts he had heard of the hor&s;e races at New-Market. He determined to be an eye-witne&s;s of what in de&s;cription appeared &s;o plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>To this end, he again ab&s;ented him&s;elf from &s;chool &ograve;ne morning early, a few days previous to the com|mencement of the races, and having enquired the road to New-Market, he made ha&s;te to quit the town, and being overtaken by the New-Market &s;tage-coach, he got into it, and arrived there that evening.</P>
<P>Nor had he forgot the principal article, a large &s;um of money: For he had been plentifully &s;upplied by an u&s;urer, who made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to get acquainted with the young noblemen and gentlemen of We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool, that by admini&s;tering to their propen&s;ity to vice, he might take the advantage of their follies, and by the help of his own cunning and artifice, reap the beu|e&s;it of their carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and inexperience.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="027335_0024_0FD40B17D9436C28">The races at length began; young Montague was wonderfully delighted with them, and perceiving with what ardor the betts were laid, he was de&s;irous of com|mencing adventurer; but did not know who to addre&s;s him&s;elf to, or how to proceed.</P>
<P>He was not &s;uffered long to remain in this &s;tate of uncertainty and perplexity. Some &s;harpers had ob|&s;erved the elegance of his dre&s;s, and a certain noble|ne&s;s of deportment by which, from his infancy, he had always been peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hed. They ju&s;tly jud|ged that he was of &s;ome con&s;iderable family, and con|cluded from his being at New-Market, that he was hardly deficient in point of ca&s;h. The&s;e ideas were &s;ufficient to induce them to mark him as a proper ob|ject, to be made a prey of.</P>
<P>One of the &s;harpers was therefore deputed from the re&s;t to try the experiment. He addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to young Montague, by a&s;king him if he would bett and choo&s;e to take odds.</P>
<P>Though our hero was ignorant of what he meant by odds, he did not choo&s;e to betray his ignorance, but an&s;wered bri&s;kly in the affirmative.</P>
<P>They began to bett with great &s;pirit, and our hero lo&s;t his money with the greate&s;t good temper, and much &s;eeming &s;atisfaction. Indeed they found him to u&s;e the &s;harpers own technical phra&s;es, <HI>a willing Pi|geon, mighty ea&s;y to be plucked.</HI> We &s;carce need to add that he was &s;tripped of every &s;hilling which he had about him.</P>
<P>His youth and inexperience, the little knowledge he had of the u&s;e of money, and the novelty of the thing, prevented him from perceiving his lo&s;&s;es in any other light, than as occurrences that mu&s;t happen upon &s;uch occa&s;ions of cour&s;e. Nay, &s;o far was he from &s;uppo&s;ing that he had heen defrauded, or any advan|tage taken of his &s;implicity or ignorance of &s;uch af|fairs, that he very willingly di&s;po&s;ed of his watch, and a

valuable ring he had with him, in order to continue the &s;port, as he called it, and indeed he did continue it, till he had nothing left.</P>
<P>In the evening he retired from the cour&s;e much fati|gued, and repaired to the inn where he had hitherto put up, when he &s;oon went to bed.</P>
<P>The next morning he &s;eemed rather chagrined, that he had not money to repeat his diver&s;ions. He however repaired to the cour&s;e at the u&s;ual time, thinking that he might meet with tho&s;e who had won his money the day before, and not doubting but they would lend him a tri|fle to try his luck again.</P>
<P>He had however not been above a quarter of an hour upon the cour&s;e, before he was perceived by the very relation, who as before mentioned, gave him the gold watch, which he had the preceding day entirely parted with.</P>
<P>This gentleman had been apprized of young Monta|gue's elopement from &s;chool before he left London, and was very happy to have an opportunity of &s;ecuring him, and &s;ending him to town again.</P>
<P>He &s;eized him immediately, and taking him to an inn, &s;trictly interrogated and &s;everely reprimanded him. Montague confe&s;&s;ed the truth of every thing with great candour, except the borrowing of the money of the u|&s;urer, and the &s;um he had lo&s;t; he told his relation in deed that he had lo&s;t all he brought with him, as well as his watch and ring.</P>
<P>The gentleman now explained to him in what man|ner he had been defrauded; informed him, that tho&s;e he had betted with, were no other than common &s;harp|ers, and warned him in the mo&s;t lively manner again&s;t gaming in general: he then determined to take our hero to the cour&s;e again, that he might, if po&s;&s;ible, point out tho&s;e hone&s;t gentlemen, who &s;o d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">xterou&s;ly <HI>plucked his feathers</HI> as they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> might apprehend them.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="027335_0026_0FD40B1B41B6CC08">Young Montague accompanied his relation upon this expedition with great plea&s;ure. As his pride was piqued to think he had believed tho&s;e to be gentlemen, who in reality were only &s;harpers, and to have been defrauded at a time he fancied he had lo&s;t his money fairly.</P>
<P>They had not been long upon the turf, before our hero perceived the black legged gentry who had &s;o egre|giou&s;&s;y impo&s;ed upon him: he pointed them out to his noble relation, and tho&s;e that were with him; they were ea&s;ily &s;eized upon, and &s;en&s;ible of the con&s;equence and dignity of tho&s;e in who&s;e power they were, they gladly compounded for their relea&s;e, by a re&s;titution of the watch and ring; they would indeed have re&s;tored the money, but that was generou&s;ly refu&s;ed, and very glad our hero was that it happened &s;o, as the re&s;titution would have occa&s;ioned his intercour&s;e with the u&s;urer to have been detected, for the largene&s;s of the &s;um would have cau&s;ed an enquiry into the manner by which he became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o much ca&s;h.</P>
<P>In a few days his relation returned with him to Lon|don, having during the remainder of his &s;tay at New-|Market, cau&s;ed him to be narrowly watched to prevent his e&s;caping from him, if he meditated any &s;uch thing.</P>
<P>On his arrival in town, he underwent a great number of &s;evere lectures, and at length was returned to &s;chool with particlar directions to his ma&s;ter to cha&s;ti&s;e him with tne utmo&s;t &s;everity.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e directions were punctually complied with, and he felt the terrors of &s;chool-di&s;cipline in their greate&s;t rigour.</P>
<P>This, in&s;tead of changing his di&s;po&s;ition, only &s;erved to confirm him in a determination to quit the &s;chool en|tirely on the fir&s;t opportunity, and to take &s;uch mea&s;ures as would effectually prevent his being again retaken.</P>

<P>IT was not long before he put his de&s;ign in execution. He had a pretty con&s;iderable &s;um with him, with which he was furni&s;hed by the before mentioned u&s;urer, who was always willing to accommodate any whom he knew to be heirs to ample fortunes, with whatever &s;ums their follies or vanities might require; that is, in con|&s;ideration of being allowed to extort an uncon&s;cionable premium and exorbitant intere&s;t for his kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>He made the be&s;t of his way to Wapping, where he enquired for the captain of a trading ve&s;&s;el, of whom he had been previou&s;ly informed.</P>
<P>He &s;oon found him. The captain was bound to Ca|diz, and intended to &s;ail the next day, if the weather permitted.</P>
<P>Young Montague had a pa&s;&s;ionate de&s;ire to &s;ee Spain from the accounts he had heard and read concerning it; he determined to take this opportunity, and promi&s;ed the captain to become a pa&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>Willing to pa&s;s the la&s;t evening that he intended to remain in England in a convivial manner; he went into a tavern, and ordered an elegant &s;upper. The people were &s;urprized at his youth, but did not he&s;itate to com|ply with his de&s;ire, as they perceived he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of money, and had other valuables about him.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter of the tavern was him&s;elf a notable &s;harper and perceiving the &s;implicity and inexperience of his ju|venile gue&s;t, he determined to <HI>make the mo&s;t of him.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="027335_0028_0FD40B1D82FF41F8">Young Montague anticipated his de&s;ires by reque&s;ting him to give him his company at &s;upper. This reque&s;t he not only complied with, out introduced two of his intimates who were as great rogues as him&s;elf, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the execution of his &s;cheme.</P>
<P>After &s;upper, the gla&s;s was pu&s;hed bri&s;kly about, and cards introduced, intoxication &s;oon bani&s;hed our hero's reflection; he lo&s;t his money without repining. What little precaution, or prudence he might have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed when &s;ober, was drowned in copious bumpers of claret. At length he was &s;o inebriated, as to &s;ink down &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the floor.</P>
<P>This was what the hone&s;t gentry with whom he was in company wanted; what they had not cheated him of before, they now robb'd him of, and then left him, with|out the lea&s;t farther concern, to &s;leep off the fumes of tho&s;e copious libations, which had reduced him to &s;uch a &s;hameful &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>When he came to him&s;elf in the morning he &s;carce recollected where he was; for never having been u&s;ed to intemperance before, the exce&s;s had almo&s;t obliterated the remembrance of every thing that had happened.</P>
<P>He however called aloud; when the waiter appeared, he de&s;ired &s;ome coffee, which was pre&s;ently brought him, accompanied by an enormous bill of the preceding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ight's expences.</P>
<P>When he had read the bill, he put his hand into his pocket to di&s;charge it. Words cannot expre&s;s his a&s;ton|i&s;hment, nor imagination paint his agonies, when he per|ceived that he had been plundered, not only of every &s;ixpence he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, but of his watch, ring, and every other moveable value about him.</P>
<P>He called for the landlord with an air of de&s;peration, which &s;ufficiently evinced the horror of his mind.</P>
<P>The landlord appeared&mdash;he recited his misfortune&mdash;
<PB N="30" REF="027335_0029_0FD40B2060BA6B00">
the landlord affected to fly into a violent pa&s;&s;ion, called him a &s;harper&mdash;told him he came there with a de&s;ign to bilk his hou&s;e, and that he would &s;end for a con&s;table; &s;aying the&s;e words, he ha&s;tily flung out of the room.</P>
<P>The mi&s;tre&s;s now appeared, and with an affected con|cern, pretended to have great compa&s;&s;ion upon his youth, and to pity his indi&s;cretion, &s;he repre&s;ented her hu&s;band as a mo&s;t terrible man, litigious and ra&s;h to the la&s;t de|gree, and exceedingly malicious when provoked; &s;he therefore advi&s;ed him to make his e&s;cape during her hu&s;|band's ab&s;ence, as he was gone for a con&s;table, for, &s;aid &s;he, in a very moving accent, <Q>If you are carried before a magi&s;trate, and committed to Newgate, heaven knows what will be the con&s;equence.</Q></P>
<P>Her artifice &s;ucceeded; the very name of Newgate was &s;ufficient to terrify young Montague, to whom con|finement &s;eemed terrible, though under the mo&s;t unex|ceptionable circum&s;tances; and he was too much of a novice to &s;ee through the fine&s;&s;e of the&s;e con&s;ederated &s;harpers.</P>
<P>He thanked the mi&s;tre&s;s for her kindne&s;s, as he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ed it, and ha&s;ted from the hou&s;e; winged by his fears, he hurried to the place of the captain's re&s;idence, with whom he had conver&s;ed the day before. Here he re|peated his di&s;mal tale, and with the mo&s;t doleful accen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of unaffected &s;orrow, related his misfortunes to the captain.</P>
<P>Mr. James. for that was the captain's name, &s;aw into the whole affair immediately, he well knew the hou&s;e and the people, and con&s;equently could give a pretty near gue&s;s at the nature of the collu&s;ive tran&s;action.</P>
<P>Without &s;aying a word to our he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> (whom he left at his hou&s;e)he repaired to the tavern, and calling the ma&s;|ter a&s;ide, flatly accu&s;ed him of the whole affair, telling, him that the young gentleman whom he had defrauded, was of a great family, and had mo&s;t powerful friends, that the con&s;equence of a di&s;covery of this iniquitous tran&s;action, would be his inevitable ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="027335_0030_0FD40B2330D0FE78">After a little more conver&s;ation, the landlord perceiv|ed that the captain had taken this trouble upon him&s;elf, not as an advocate for ju&s;tice, but on the more &s;ordid motives of &s;elf intere&s;t.</P>
<P>They were not long now in under&s;tanding each other. Upon a promi&s;e of &s;ecrefy, the captain was admitted to partake liberally of what young Montague had been de|&s;poiled, and became in reality an <HI>acce&s;&s;ary after the fact.</HI> In return for this genero&s;ity of the landlord, he promi&s;ed to let our hero work his pa&s;&s;age to Spain, during which voyage, he would take care to u&s;e him &s;o ill, that he &s;hould be glad to run away from the &s;hip as &s;oon as he landed, and then it would be a miracle if ever he return|ed to England again, to accu&s;e them of defrauding him.</P>
<P>Thus we may perceive that Captain James was no hone&s;ter than his worthy neighbours.</P>
<P>That evening our hero embarked on board the &s;hip, on the &s;tipulated agreement of working his pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>During the voyage, the captain punctually performed the promi&s;e he had made to the landlord, for he u&s;ed poor Montague &s;o exceeding ill, that when they arrived at Cadiz, he took the fir&s;t opportunity of quitting de &s;hip.</P>
<P>The repeated misfortunes he had met with at &s;o early an age, one would imagine, ought to have cured him of his roving di&s;po&s;ition; but it had the contrary effect; his inclination increa&s;ed with difficulties, and a re&s;olu|tion which never for&s;ook his mind, &s;upported him under all misfortunes.</P>

Exce&s;&s;ive Heat.&mdash;Singular Cu&s;toms.&mdash;Frequent Mur|ders. &mdash;Sanctuaries.&mdash;Character of the Spaniards.</HI></HEAD>
<P>YOUNG Montague though of &s;o volatile a di&s;po&s;i|tion, had made an amazing progre&s;s in his &s;tudies. The &s;trength of his memory, and quickne&s;s of his pene|tration enabled him to make greater literary acqui&s;itions than many of a much more &s;edate turn of mind, and a&s;|&s;iduous di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>He was exceedingly well acquainted with the Latin cla&s;&s;ics, and had &s;ome knowledge of the Greek. He was well verled in French, having been taught to &s;peak it from his infancy; and had a tolerable &s;mattering of the Spani&s;h: &s;o that he was not at &s;o great a lo&s;s as might at fir&s;t be conceived.</P>
<P>Luckily in plundering him, the &s;harpers had over|looked a pair of Mocoa &s;leeve buttons &s;et in gold. The&s;e he &s;old at Cadiz, and by that means <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rocured &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for &s;ome days.</P>
<P>When his money was ju&s;t exhau&s;ted, he by chance fell into conver&s;ation with a Muleteer, who wanted an a&s;&s;i&s;tant. Montague readily offered his &s;ervice, which was accepted.</P>
<P>This employ though one of the meane&s;t in Spain, &s;eemed the mo&s;t eligible and plea&s;ing to our hero, as it would give him an opportunity of travelling unque&s;tion|ed and unmole&s;ted, and of &s;eeing many parts of the kingdom at his lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>In travelling with his now ma&s;ter be found great plea|&s;ure, as every day pre&s;ented him with &s;omething new,
<PB N="33" REF="027335_0032_0FD40B261911ADC8">
and every object was food for his curio&s;ity; but his &s;atis|faction was da&s;h'd with &s;ome difficulties and inconveni|ences. There are no beds in the inns to accommodate travellers; he was frequently obliged to lay on the boards, and even there, was almo&s;t tormented to death with vermin.</P>
<P>Sometimes by choice, he lay in the &s;table with the mules, but here another plague attended him, for he was &s;o pe&s;tered with rats and mice, that he very &s;eldom could get a wink of &s;leep.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the inns in Spain, it is remarkable that you enter the hou&s;es through the &s;tables, nay, even the &s;tairs that lead to the different bed chambers are in the, &s;tables, and always exceedingly dark and dirty.</P>
<P>Another di&s;agreeable circum&s;tance was the article of food. Every thing the Spaniards eat is &s;o full of gar|lick, &s;affron, &s;pice, and pepper, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for tho&s;e who are not u&s;ed to &s;uch high &s;ea&s;oning, to &s;wal|low their food; and unluckily, his ma&s;ter happened to be fond to an exce&s;s of &s;uch reli&s;hing di&s;hes, &s;o that poor Montague was often obliged to go without his dinner, or to eat only a piece of dry bread, which was as black as a coal, and often &s;o &s;tale and hard that he was forced to dip it in water to &s;often it before he was able to bite it.</P>
<P>The exce&s;&s;ive heat in Spain occa&s;ions a copious per|&s;piration; this young Montague, who was naturally in|clining to corpulency, found! exceedingly trouble&s;ome. He, however frequently relieved him&s;elf by wiping the &s;weat which trickled down his face, with a very fine and beautiful India handkerchief.</P>
<P>His ma&s;ter frequently &s;aw this handkerchief with an envious eye. One day he a&s;ked to look at it.</P>
<P>Montague gave it him. He admired it for &s;ome time, and at length ki&s;&s;ing it very devoutly, put it into his pocket, &s;aying at the &s;ame time, that he did not think our hero of &s;o liberal a temper; but that he &s;hould for
<PB N="34" REF="027335_0033_0FD40B278F75CF38">
ever e&s;teem him for a pre&s;ent which &s;hewed at once his genero&s;ity and good nature. He then ki&s;&s;ed his thumb, laid acro&s;s one of his fingers, and &s;wore to be his friend as long as he lived.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the cu&s;tom of Spain, and is looked upon as a mo&s;t &s;olemn manner of &s;wearing. The Spaniards hold anoath &s;o made, as &s;acred, and &s;eldom or never break it.</NOTE></P>
<P>Our hero was a&s;toni&s;hed at this proceeding; but &s;aid nothing to his ma&s;ter; he was however &s;orry for the lo&s;s of his handkerchief, as the want of it proved a great in|convenience.</P>
<P>To account for this tran&s;action of his ma&s;ter, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that young Montague afterwards found that it was cu&s;tomary in Spain, for any one who had a de&s;ire for &s;omething belonging to another, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to &s;ee it, when, if they chu&s;e to keep it, they ki&s;s it and re|turn thanks for it, as if it had been given them. This method of converting one per&s;on's property to the u&s;e of another, is &s;o common in Spain, that the natives take no notice of its inconveniency.</P>
<P>Being once near Berberana, a town in Old-Ca&s;tile, our hero perceived a gentleman lying in a ditch, wel|tering in his blood; he would fain have gone to have &s;een if he was quite dead, but his ma&s;ter would not let him, telling him to take no notice of it, but to keep on his way, and not to mention a &s;yllable about the matter to any per&s;on.</P>
<P>This at once alarmed young Montague, and excited his curio&s;ity; he began to enquire more particularly into the cu&s;toms and manners of the country than he had hitherto done; and his ma&s;ter, who was not defi|cient in point of under&s;tanding, gave him a very judi|cious account, which in &s;ub&s;tance was as follows:</P>
<P>That the Spaniards affect a &s;olemn deportment, flow and &s;teady pace, and &s;erious countenance, that this &s;tud|ied gravity is only a veil to cover an infinite fund of wit
<PB N="35" REF="027335_0034_0FD40B2947052A38">
and humour. They &s;peak with great deliberation, and a maje&s;tic tone, which, when they utter a joke or piece of raillery, gives it a double force. They are brave without being ra&s;h, for they do not love to attack, but to &s;tand on the defen&s;ive; and this indolent intrepidity they a&s;cribe to prudence. They are o&s;tentatious in pageantry and &s;how, yet unaffectedly liberal; revenge|ful without appearing angry, libidinous and luxurious with re&s;pect to women, but temperate and &s;ober, in re|gard to eating and drinking. They are tenacious of their honour, and great ob&s;ervers of tneir words, though it co&s;t them their lives. Patient, ob&s;tinate, and great humouri&s;ts; they are vivacious, penetrating, fluent in &s;peaking, but jealous to an exce&s;s; exceedingly &s;uper|&s;titious, and very bad oeconomi&s;ts. Their behaviour is affected, formal and &s;tiff, they are naturally ingenious, but too lazy to employ their ingenuity, and of that im|placable di&s;po&s;ition, that they never forgive an injury, or fail to re&s;ent an affront, which is &s;eldom done in an honourable manner, but u&s;ually by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. Nay, they not only cau&s;e tho&s;e to be murdered who have af|fronted them, but likewi&s;e &s;uch as they have affronted, le&s;t they &s;hould take the &s;ame advantage, for their max|im is, <HI>kill or be killed.</HI></P>
<P>One great rea&s;on of the frequent murders in Spain, is the ea&s;ine&s;s with which the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in can &s;creen him&s;elf from ju&s;tice; for if he flies to a church or a convent, he is &s;afe; and he generally takes care to commit the crime near &s;ome &s;anctuary. The&s;e fanctuaries are al|mo&s;t innumerable.</P>
<P>The Spaniard are &s;hort and lean. Leanne&s;s indeed is deemed a beauty among them, but they are well made, and have fine features. They have indeed a yel|low or du&s;ky completion, but their eyes are remarkably bright, and their teeth regular and well &s;et they have large legs and &s;mall feet, their hair is parted in the mid|dle, &s;trait cut, and tucked behind the ears.</P>
<P>They wear a large <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> their cloaths are always black, over which they have a black &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ieze cloak.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="027335_0035_0FD40B2B50869F10">They have &s;trait breeches and hanging &s;leeves a long &s;word and a poinard.</P>
<P>Our hero found one advantage however in belonging to a Muleteer, which was, being better treated at the inns than even people of fa&s;hion, for as the Muleteers are con&s;tant cu&s;tomers and take their pa&s;&s;engers to what inn they plea&s;e, they are more care&s;&s;ed by the innkeepers, than genteeler per&s;ons whom they may never &s;ee again.</P>
<P>They have &s;eldom above one cup in an inn, and if the mule driver gets hold of it, even a nobleman mu&s;t &s;tay with patience till he has done with it, or drink out of a wooden bowl or earthen pitcher.</P>
<P>As there are no chimneys in the inns, but in lieu thereof a hole in the cieling to let the &s;moke through, people in cold weather are almo&s;t choaked and blinded. Be&s;ides, every thing mu&s;t be paid for before you have it, for the inn-keeper is only allowed to lodge ye, but not to find you either in eating or drinking. He is therefore (being very poor him&s;elf) obliged to a&s;k the traveller for money, to go for what he wants, to the butcher, baker, fruiterer, vintner, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The innkeepers are great extortioners, and will de|fraud you if they can, though at the &s;ame time they pre|tend to do you the greate&s;t honour; for as &s;oon as ever you enter their hou&s;e, they run to dre&s;s them&s;elves in their be&s;t, being perhaps the poore&s;t and the proude&s;t publicans in the univer&s;e, the good woman of the hou&s;e then brings all her children, if &s;he has any, about you, and obliges them to touch your cloaths, and rub their eyes, throats, checks and hands with them.</P>
<P>In noblemen and gentlemen's families, the &s;ervants all live upon board wages, which are very low, and in fact, though naturally ab&s;temious, they are half &s;tarved; this renders them &s;o ravenous, that they pilfer as much as they can from what is dre&s;t for their ma&s;ter's tables; to prevent which, the grand dinners in Spain are u&s;ually &s;ent up in di&s;her and covers, which are padlocked to|gether,

<P>SPAIN it certainly the region of love and gallantry; the tender pa&s;&s;ion is here carried to its utmo&s;t ex|ce&s;s of refinement; no people in the univer&s;e, are by nature more amorous than the Spaniards; the climate and manner of living, increa&s;es their natural di&s;po&s;ition for voluptuous plea&s;ures, and the great re&s;traint under which the women are kept, is a &s;pur to their ingenuity, and adds to the extacy of every amour, by giving it the air of a deep intrigue.</P>

<P>He could not but perceive, that in this country, <HI>Cu|pid</HI> found employment for many who were much youn|ger than him&s;elf, for he was now con&s;iderably turned of fifteen years of age, and here it frequently happens, that a youth of fourteen is married to a girl of twelve, he therefore could not but upbraid him&s;elf for having lived to <HI>&s;o advanced an age,</HI> without having had a mi&s;tre&s;s, or engaging in an amour.</P>
<P>It was his nature to be ardent in whatever he took in his head, the&s;e ideas were therefore no &s;ooner e&s;tabli&s;hed in his imagination, than he began to &s;igh for every wo|man he &s;aw, or to langui&s;h after ideal mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. In|deed he never &s;aw any woman but what was veiled, un|le&s;s
<PB N="38" REF="027335_0037_0FD40B2FD45CA580">
a few by chance, who were either mi&s;erably poor, or very old and ugly.</P>
<P>As he had not the liberty of indulging him&s;elf with a &s;ight of their features, or permi&s;&s;ion to admire their complexions, he determined to do in fancy what the cu&s;tom of the country denied him the enjoyment of in reality. He therefore never met a woman, but he be|gan to unveil her, (in imagination) and to &s;trip her (ide|ally) from tho&s;e envious robes that prevented him from gazing on her native charms, and we mu&s;t do the bril|liancy of his fancy in this re&s;pect, the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that he never beheld any Spani&s;h nymph, by this method, but what was a perfect beauty, for he took care to figure to him &s;elf, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, nothing but paragons of perfection.</P>
<P>But this amorous diet was of too thin a con&s;i&s;tency, to gratify the warmth of his appetite long; he found &s;peculative pa&s;&s;ion not at all &s;uitable to the ardor of his di&s;po&s;ition, and longed very much to reduce the theory of love to practice.</P>
<P>He was ambitious, but the &s;phere of life in which he at pre&s;ent moved, prevented him from entertaining the idea of &s;oaring to &s;uch exalted beauties, where rank and charms merited that grandees alone &s;hould kneel before them. He began for the fir&s;t time to be a&s;hamed of his &s;ituation, and to blame him&s;elf for a frolick which had reduced him &s;o low in the &s;cale of human con&s;equence.</P>
<P>As there was no remedy but patience, he determined to make a virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, and not to lo&s;e the lea&s;t opportunity of indulging him&s;elf in tho&s;e plea&s;ures which might lie within his reach, but to avail him&s;elf of every means of &s;en&s;ual gratification which chance might pre&s;ent, or fortune lay before him.</P>
<P>The&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;imilar ideas continually employed his mind, but he did not for &s;ome time, meet with any ad|venture worth recording.</P>

<P>OUR hero could not keep his eyes from being fixed on the agreeable <HI>Jeanot,</HI> who, for her part took every opportunity to exchange glances with him. In|deed we cannot be &s;urprized at this, as it is very proba|ble, that &s;he never in her life before, beheld &s;o comely a youth. For Montague was very genteel in his per&s;on, and perfectly well made; his features were fine and regular, and though he was a little fun-burnt with tra|velling about, his complexion &s;till far exceeded what was to be &s;een among the natives of Spain. Add to this, he was &s;prightly in his conver&s;ation, engaging in his manner, and had a mo&s;t in&s;inuating addre&s;s. Nei|ther was her eye di&s;gu&s;ted by &s;eeing him in a dre&s;s to
<PB N="40" REF="027335_0039_0FD40B32D905DA70">
which &s;he was not familiarized; for a little before, his ma&s;ter had made him adopt the Spani&s;h habit.</P>
<P>Our hero, by means of the quickne&s;s of his genius, and &s;trength of his memory, had &s;o well improved him|&s;elf in the Spani&s;h tongue, that he could &s;peak it almo&s;t as fluently as a native, and was &s;carce to be di&s;tingui&s;hed for a foreigner by his accent. Thus he was under no apprehen&s;ion of being mi&s;under&s;tood, if he could but procure an opportunity of addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to <HI>Jeanot.</HI></P>
<P>Fortune was propitious to his wi&s;hes&mdash;the ho&s;te&s;s was called out of the hou&s;e to a daughter of her's in the neighbourhood, who was &s;uddenly taken ill. The land|lord had employment enough in the &s;table, to keep him far &s;ome time from interrupting them, and with re&s;pect to his ma&s;ter, the only remaining &s;py, <HI>Morpheus</HI> &s;tood his friend by clo&s;ing his eye-lids with a leaden &s;leep.</P>
<P>Montague did not let &s;lip this favourable opportunity. He poured forth the mo&s;t rapturous expre&s;&s;ions of love, with an amazing volubility; and took very clo&s;e liber|ties, which though not authorized by the cu&s;toms of Spain, yet were by no means di&s;plea&s;ing to the blyth, blooming and amorous <HI>Jeanot</HI>; in fine &s;he let him know the &s;it|uation of her bed-chamber, and gave him to under&s;tand that if he &s;hould happen to mi&s;take it for his own in the night, that &s;he &s;hould not be terrified, or fancy him to be a gho&s;t.</P>
<P>Montague was quite in raptures at the&s;e innuendo's. He impatiently wi&s;hed for the hour of retiring to re&s;t, and could eat no &s;upper, for the thought of his ap|proaching happine&s;s, as he deemed it.</P>
<P>At length the family retired to re&s;t. Montague was obliged to lay with his ma&s;ter, as there was no other bed vacant. And happy was he, as &s;oon as he found by the melody of his no&s;e, that he was in a profound &s;leep.</P>
<P>He now crept &s;oftly from his ma&s;ter, and pur&s;ued, as he thought, the directions given him by the pretty <HI>Jea|not</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="027335_0040_0FD40B3567CD3D50">
He entered the room, and felt about for the bed. Having found it, he called his mi&s;tre&s;s by the mo&s;t en|dearing epithets, and began to embrace her as he ima|gined, when he received a box in the car that almo&s;t &s;tunned him.</P>
<P>Putting his hands out to guard him&s;elf from another &s;alute of a &s;imilar nature, if &s;uch a repetition &s;hould be intended, he was amazed at encountering a rough face, and a pair of mu&s;tachios; the&s;e he was convinced could not appertain to the lovely <HI>Jeanot,</HI> he therefore perceiv|ed that he had made a very e&s;&s;ential mi&s;take, and thought it expedient to retreat with as much expedition as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>He made the be&s;t of his way towards the door of the chamber, but unluckily in his hurry ran his no&s;e again&s;t it, he not only felt an extremity of pain by the blow, but was coverd with blood in a moment. To add to his embarra&s;&s;ment, his whi&s;kered antagoni&s;t had pur&s;ued him to be revenged for having his repo&s;e di&s;turbed, and was di&s;tributing convincing proo&s;s of his re&s;entment upon the back, &s;houlders, and head of poor Montague.</P>
<P>Our hero at length opened the door, and precipitate|ly fled he knew not which way nor whither, as his principal concern was to e&s;cape the fury of his &s;ilent a&s;|&s;ailant, for the per&s;on who was &s;o liberal in the u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of his hands, to the great mortification of poor Montague, made not the lea&s;t u&s;e of his tongue; nor did our hero utter a groan, le&s;t he &s;hould be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>But he made ha&s;te in vain, for the other pur&s;ued him with equal celerity, when a thought came into his head to throw him&s;elf &s;uddenly down, which would occa&s;ion his pur&s;uer to fall over him, and by this he imagined he might probably e&s;cape.</P>
<P>He put this &s;cheme into execution and it &s;ucceded to admiration. His antagoni&s;t had a, terrible fall, and brake his forehead again&s;t the wainscot. He did not however bear his mi&s;fortune with that degree of philo|&s;ophic
<PB N="42" REF="027335_0041_0FD40B38D538A9B8">
patience which young Montague had &s;hewn un|der the &s;everity of his blows, but roared out with amaz|ing vociferation. The noi&s;e alarmed the whole hou&s;e; our hero's ma&s;ter heard it. He called Montague, but receiving no an&s;wer, he felt about the bed for him; not being able to find him, he began to conjecture that he was either the cau&s;e of the di&s;turbance, or by &s;ome means intere&s;ted in it. He determined to be convinced of the truth of this &s;urmi&s;e, &s;o quitting his bed and room, he made as much ha&s;te as the darkne&s;s would permit, to|wards the place from whence the found &s;eemed to pre|ceed, and pacing along a gallery, drew nearer and near|er to it.</P>
<P>This noi&s;e was made by the muleteer, who as before mentioned, was upon his return fron Madrid to Sala|manca. Our hero having mi&s;taken his room for <HI>Jea|not</HI>'s was the occa&s;ion of this terrible <HI>fracas,</HI> which in the &s;equel was &s;till more whim&s;ical than what had been already related. For the muleteer having made a tol|erable noi&s;e, and cur&s;ed our hero, him&s;elf, and the inn &s;ufficiently, was about to &s;eek his chamber again, when turning &s;uddenly round, his head came exactly in con|tact with that of Montague's ma&s;ter, and their foreheads rung and rebounded with the violence of the blow. The luckle&s;s muleteer fancied that he was indebted for this new in&s;ult to the &s;ame per&s;on as fir&s;t di&s;turbed him, and afterwards threw him down, the additional pain ren|dered him outrageous; He bellowed like a wounded bull in the <HI>Sierra Ronda,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The place in Madrid, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> and laid about him like a fury.</P>
<P>Montague's ma&s;ter did not remain in debt for any of the blows he received, but hone&s;tly returned the princi|pal with &s;ub&s;tantial intere&s;t. At length they clo&s;ed with each other, and, falling together again&s;t a door in the gallery, they bur&s;t it open, and both fell into the room with a terrible noi&s;e.</P>
<P>This was the bed-chamber belonging to the ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s of the inn, who as &s;oon as they heard the
<PB N="43" REF="027335_0042_0FD40B397B533D98">
fir&s;t alarm between the Muleteer and Montague, had covered them&s;elves over head and ears with the bed|cloaths, and in&s;tead of going to enquire into the cau&s;e of the di&s;turbance, were counting their beads, repeating Ave Marias, and addre&s;&s;ng them&s;elves to all the &s;aints in the kalendar.</P>
<P>But finding the danger &s;o near them, they grew fran|tic and began to verify the old proverb, which &s;ays that <HI>cowards will fight valiantly when drove to de&s;peration.</HI> They jumped from the bed in a kind of phrenzy, left off &s;aying their prayers to utter imprecations, and threw away their beads that they might have a better opportu|nity of u&s;ing their hands, which they did in a mo&s;t fu|rious manner, &s;o that the engagement now became what is u&s;ually termed <HI>a battle royal,</HI> for as they fought at random, it was impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h friend from foe; in fine, the noi&s;e of blows, oaths and cries in concert made an inexpre&s;&s;ible confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>During the&s;e athletic adventures and manual opera|tions in the dark, the reader may be curious to know what became of young Montague; to &s;ay the truth, he was employed much more to his &s;atisfaction, than his ma&s;ter, or the re&s;t of the combatants; for after having e&s;caped from the &s;everity of the muleteer's re&s;entment, he very prudently thought it the mo&s;t judicious thing to retreat with all po&s;&s;ible expedition to his chamber again but endeavouring to execute this resolution, he again mi&s;took another chamber for his own. This &s;econd mi&s;take was however much more plea&s;ing than the fir&s;t, for his error conducted him to the bed-&s;ide of the lovely <HI>Jeanot,</HI> who had long expected him with impatience, but on hearing the various di&s;turbances of the night, had lain for a con&s;iderable time panting for fear.</P>
<P>In going to &s;tep into bed, our hero by chance put his hand upon her face; he was plea&s;ingly &s;urprize<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at its &s;oftne&s;s, he knew it did not belong to his ma&s;ter, he felt no roughne&s;s, no mu&s;tachios, and began to conceive that he had happily rectified one mi&s;take by another.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="027335_0043_0FD40B3B9CB2A248">The lovers &s;oon under&s;tood each other, a long parley would have been the height of ab&s;urdity, for the di&s;|turbance &s;till continued, no time was to be lo&s;t, the mo|ments were precious; and the enamoured pair, thus cir|eam&s;tanced, were under the nece&s;&s;ity of heartily &s;natch|ing tho&s;e inexpre&s;&s;ible raptures, which fancy can better paint than words de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>An extatic <HI>fea&s;t</HI> was denied them, the golden in&s;tant Only ju&s;t permitted them to <HI>taste</HI> of bli&s;s.

<P>He at length gained his bed before his ma&s;ter, and <HI>Jeanot</HI> having lighted a lamp, repaired to the field of battle, where the combatants were mutually a&s;toni&s;hed at the bloody &s;pectacle each other made, ana equally en|raged on account of what they felt.</P>

<P>ON the cu&s;uing morning, the appearance of every one of the combatants was truly &s;ingular; the
<PB N="45" REF="027335_0044_0FD40B3C95E0E420">
only one in the hou&s;e not externally marked, was pretty <HI>Jeanot,</HI> who appeared as demure as a ve&s;tal virgin.</P>
<P>The inn-keeper appeared with a large plai&s;ter over one eye, and the other &s;o brui&s;ed that he could &s;carcely &s;ee out of it. His wife had covered her face almo&s;t on|tirely with gold-beater's &s;kin, to hide the marks of vio|lence which had disfigured it; &s;o that &s;he cut a very whim&s;ical figure; the muleteer had bound up his head and jaws with as much cloth, as would have made a tur|ban for a Turki&s;h Ba&s;haw; and young Montague made his appearance with a no&s;e as big as his fi&s;t, and one eye entirely clo&s;ed up; he however, with the other, took care to ogle <HI>Jeanot,</HI> who now and then returned him a gracious glance.</P>
<P>But our hero concealed his being the primitive cau&s;e of this fracas; he averred that he had never been out of bed during the whole night, and that he received &s;everal blows, which awaked htm from his &s;leep, and had done him the injury that was &s;o extremely obvious on his countenance.</P>
<P>As the ma&s;ter gave implicit credit to young Monta|gue, he le&s;t the inn, firmly per&s;uaded that it was haunt|ed, and fully determined never to put up there again, whenever he happened to travel that road.</P>
<P>The &s;ame evening they arrived at Madrid, very &s;ort with the brui&s;es they had &s;o recently received, and great|ly fatigued with their journey.</P>
<P>Madrid, which is about two Engli&s;h miles in circum|ference, has a pretty appearance from the country to a &s;tranger as he approaches it. The number of &s;pires, cupolas, and other large edifices, look very noble at a di&s;tance; but the idea of magnificence and &s;plender grad|ually decrea&s;es as the traveller enters the town.</P>
<P>Its river, called the Manzanares, is for &s;everal months in the year quite dry, at other times a muddy &s;tream; but in the &s;pring it contains a prodigious quantity of wa|ter,
<PB N="46" REF="027335_0045_0FD40B3E910C9BD8">
and indeed frequently overflows, by means of the torrents of rain and the melted &s;now which pour down from the neighbouring mountains.</P>
<P>There is a magnificent &s;tone bridge over this river, which was built by Philip II. Many travellers who have &s;een the Manzanares only at the time of its being dried up, or at lea&s;t a muddy puddle, have made them|&s;elves very merry at that monarch's expence for build|ing &s;o large a bridge, where there was no water; but had the&s;e critics &s;een the river at the time of its &s;well; they would have been convinced, that their raillety was premature.</P>
<P>Madrid is a very offen&s;ive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ace to the olfactory nerves, owing to the great quantity of filth, which every where lies about the &s;treets, and the number of &s;tagnant ditches which are to be found in it, &s;o that the garrets are the mo&s;t eligible apartments to live in, as they are the far|the&s;t removed from the foetid vapors, that ari&s;e from the polluted ground. Indeed the &s;treets are pretty &s;traight and tolerably wide, and the hou&s;es hand&s;ome enough to look at, on the out&s;ide; but then the &s;treets are &s;o du&s;ty in dry weather, and &s;o dirty in wet weather, that you are either choaked and blinded, or up to your knees in mud. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since young Montague was in Spain, the city of Mudrid has been greatly improved the &s;treets have been paved, the filth removed, and proper regulations made to pre&s;erve it from the above inconveniences, &s;o that at pre&s;ent, it is one of the cleane&s;t cities in Europe.</NOTE></P>

<P>THERE is &s;uch a &s;amene&s;s in the towns and hou&s;es, A and &s;uch a &s;ingularity of manners among the Span|iards in general, that, according to the be&s;t writers, tho&s;e who have &s;een one town, the hou&s;e, or one Spaniard, may entertain a. pretty tolerable idea of the towns, hou|&s;es, and people in general.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es of the Grandees and other capital people, are magnificently furn&s;ihed, particularly with immen&s;e quantities of plate; but every thing is rather intrin&s;i|cally valuable than well executed; &s;uperb than elegant. Almo&s;t all the common hou&s;es, be&s;ides being exceed|ingly inconvenient, are deficient in the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary uten&s;ils.</P>
<P>As the cultivation of the land is much neglected, through the natural indolence of the Spaniards, and as they are carele&s;e about, or rather de&s;pi&s;e commerce, their tables are not over well &s;upplied, either with their own, or the commodities of other countries. Indeed the poorer &s;ort, though naturally very ab&s;temious have &s;carce enough to &s;upply even their temperate de&s;ires.</P>
<P>Our hero, though young and volatile, yet had an un|bounded curio&s;ity, and took care to minutely ob&s;erve whatever was in his reach. The preceding, and all &s;ub|&s;equent ob&s;ervatiom on different countries, were extrac|ted from his minutes and memorandums, which he care|fully pre&s;erved through thr cour&s;e of his life; and was happy to think, that even in the wildne&s;s and profligacy of youth, he had never omitted to note down any thing

<P>Madrid was not the place to occa&s;ion a decrea&s;e of young Montague's natural warmth of di&s;po&s;ition and am|orous temper. The recital of uumerous intrigues equally plea&s;ant and &s;urpri&s;ing, that were continually poured into his ea&s;t, kept his mind perpetually awake to the tender|e&s;t &s;en&s;atiom: while the idea of the agreeable <HI>Jeanot,</HI> made him wi&s;h for an intrigue in Madrid, equally de|lightful and more permanent.</P>
<P>Montague's ma&s;ter was on account of &s;ome prticular bu&s;ine&s;s, obliged to remain in Madrid for a few weeks. Our here had therefore a great opportunity of indulging his curio&s;ity, by almo&s;t continually rambling about as he had nothing el&s;e to do but to take care of his mules, and tale his plea&s;ures; nor was he very &s;ollicitous con|cerning the hour at which he returned to his <HI>Po&s;ada,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pe&s;ada in Spani&s;h, &s;ignifies an Inn, and Pe&s;adera on In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> as his <HI>Po&s;adera</HI> was a mighty good-natured facetious man, and now and then woula &s;lip out with his guittar in his hand, and have a night ramble him&s;elf; for in Spain the nocturnal excur&s;ions are productive of many plea&s;ant intrigues; and indeed as the climate is &s;o ex|ceedingly hot, the night is the mo&s;t agreeable part of the twenty-four hours.</P>

<P>THE impatient <HI>Lucilla</HI> could not po&s;&s;ibly be more impatient to &s;ee her lover, than young Montague was for the hour of ten, to make if po&s;&s;ible an advan|tage of her me&s;&s;enger's mi&s;take.</P>
<P>He deemed this a fair opening of an intrigue, and his heart was in the utmo&s;t palpitation, as he entered in the Alcazar Street at the pre&s;cribed time.</P>
<P>The billet unluckily did not mention, whether the hou&s;e was on the right or left hand &s;ide of the Fontana d'Ora. Montague however perceiving a door open on the left hand &s;ide, did not in the lea&s;t doubt but that was the pa&s;&s;age through which he mu&s;t &s;terr to the Ely|&s;ium of his fair and amorous <HI>Lucilla</HI>'s apartment.</P>
<P>Without he&s;itation he entered the hou&s;e, and with|out reflecting on the con&s;equences, crept &s;oftly up &s;tain.</P>
<P>He perceived a glimmering light to i&s;&s;ue from a door, which was left a-Jar.</P>
<P>He pu&s;hed it open, and entered, but for &s;ome mo|ments, could &s;carce perceive what was in the apart|ments; a &s;mall wax taper being the only light, it threw &s;o di&s;mal a gloom around, as to ca&s;t a damp upon the flame of our hero's &s;anguine expectations. After rub|bing his eyes for &s;ome time and advancing a &s;tep farther into the room, in&s;tead of a beautiful young lady, ready to throw her veil a&s;ide and receive him with open arms,
<PB N="51" REF="027335_0050_0FD40B4613537AB0">
as his imagination had painted in the mo&s;t glowing co|lours on the canvas of nope, he perceived at the farther end of the aparment, (which was entirely hung with black) a coffin, containing a corp&s;e in a winding-&s;heet, decorated with abundance of flowers. On each &s;ide &s;at a female dre&s;t in deep mourning, and covered with a long black veil, under which they frequently wiped the, tears from their eyes with a white handkerchief. The&s;e ladies beat their brea&s;ts, and &s;ighed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">ntly, but did not utter a &s;yllable. Our hero indeed &s;poke no more than they, for he was dumb with a&s;toni&s;nment.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The cu&s;tom in Spain of keeping &s;ilent upon &s;uch occa&s;ions is &s;trictly ob&s;erved; nor would the mourners who &s;it by a dead corp&s;e either &s;tir or &s;peak, even if they &s;aw a ruffian enter to rob the hou&s;e. If a lady goes to condole with another for the lo&s;s of her hu&s;band, neither the vi&s;itor nor vi&s;ited &s;peak a &s;yllable, but both &s;it down and weep, &s;igh, and beat their brea&s;ts; then the vi&s;itor departs without having uttered a word.</NOTE></P>
<P>The whole was a &s;trange contra&s;t to what he naturally expected, from the contents of the billet-doux, and a di&s;mal rever&s;e to a per&s;on of his amorous di&s;po&s;ition, in the mid&s;t of his exaltation on the &s;tilts ot <HI>flattering fairy hope.</HI></P>
<P>Young Montague was exceedingly puzzled to account for &s;o extraordinary a &s;cene, which &s;o little coincided with the nature of the invitation contained in the billet-|doux; and as it is very probable that our readers may be as much puzzled as he was, we will not hold them any longer in &s;u&s;pence, but unriddle the whole affair.</P>
<P>Our hero had mi&s;taken the hou&s;e, the habitation of <HI>Lucilla</HI> being on the right hand &s;ide of the Fontana d, Ora, in&s;tead of the le&s;t, which he had entered, and which had been the re&s;idence of an eminent jeweller,
<PB N="52" REF="027335_0051_0FD40B47DC90D5F0">
lately decea&s;ed, who&s;e widow and &s;i&s;ter were mourning by his coffin.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s they were &s;urpri&s;ed and even alarmed at his appearance, but complying with their cu&s;tom neither to &s;tir nor &s;peak, our hero was &s;uffered to depart un|que&s;tioned, and unmole&s;ted for his intru&s;ion.</P>
<P>As he left the jeweller's hou&s;e he began to blame him&s;elf greatly for his avidity, in gratifying his pa&s;&s;ions at the expence of his prudence, and even &s;afety, and was ju&s;t about to enter into an abundance of wi&s;e re&s;olu|tions, by which he de&s;igned to regulate his future con|duct, curb his voluptuous di&s;po&s;ition, and repre&s;s his inordinate curio&s;ity; but ju&s;t as he had determined to be va&s;tly philo&s;ophic and &s;age, a female tapped him upon the &s;houlder.</P>

<P>THIS was the very per&s;on who had given him the billet-doux in the Prado.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Cavellero,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, you have been very dilatory; one &s;hould not think that one of your age would be tardy, when a young lady of a noble family and at once &s;o beautiful and fond is in the ca&s;e.

we to depend on any of our determinations, formed un|der the influence of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>By the words of his conductne&s;s, he ea&s;ily perceived his previous mi&s;take, and re&s;olved, &s;ince fortune had now thought proper to be propitious, to make him&s;elf amends for his late chagrin and di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>He was led into a &s;uperb apartment, where his con|ductre&s;s left him for a few minutes to fetch the lady.</P>
<P>He pa&s;t this interval in viewing the richne&s;s of the furniture, and elegance of the tape&s;try, till the entrance of the lady pre&s;ented him with an object more worthy of his admiration. Without particularizing her charms, or dwelling upon &s;ingle beauties, it is &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that &s;he was <HI>more</HI> than
<Q><L>All that painting can expre&s;s,</L>
<L>Or youthful poets fancy when they love.</L></Q></P>
<P>Young Montague was &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed with the &s;plendor of her charms, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch like a flood of light overpowered his &s;en&s;es, that he &s;tood motionle&s;s as a &s;tatue, and per|fectly &s;ilent. He totally forgot every &s;yllable of a one compliment which he had taken great pains to form, in order to addre&s;s her; nor had he remembered it, was he able to utter it.</P>
<P>The lady no &s;ooner advanced towards young Monta|gue; but &s;he perceived the error of her confidant, and &s;tarting back greatly alarmed, &s;he &s;aid with a tremulous voice, "you have ruined me, this is a &s;tranger." Then &s;inking into a chair, &s;he appeared to be much terrified.</P>
<P>Our hero having now a little recovered, threw him|&s;elf at the lady's feet, and entreated her not to di&s;com|po&s;e her&s;elf with needle&s;s fears, &s;aying that he was ex|ceedingly afflicted to find that the accident which made him the happie&s;t of mortals, was to her a cau&s;e of un|ea&s;ine&s;s.
<PB N="54" REF="027335_0053_0FD40B495F315DE8">
That the interview was certainly founded on a mi&s;take, but fortune, who was the author of all mi&s;|takes, to make amends for the errors &s;he had occa&s;ion|ed, generally rendered them of a propitious kind.</P>
<P>Our hero was naturally an orator, his action was graceful, and his eloquence became him exceedingly, nor were his talents lo&s;t on an inanimate &s;tatue; the lady was not compo&s;ed of ice, and the following cir|cum&s;tances of her life will evince, that fortune had not directed young Montage to an object, on whom his endowments were unlikely to make an impre&s;&s;ion, or his eloquence to be unavailing.</P>
<P>This lady, as we have already mentioned, might be deemed a perfect beauty; the natural warmth of her con&s;titution rendered her pretty amorous, and a di&s;po|&s;ition ea&s;ily &s;u&s;ceptible of the tendere&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, made her a willing victim to the &s;hafts of gallantry.</P>
<P>Her family was noble but not rich, which made her father, while &s;he was yet very young, readily li&s;ten to the overtures of a gentleman, illu&s;trious by de&s;cent, and in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an ample fortune.</P>
<P>Though &s;he felt no particular tendeme&s;s for this gen|tleman, as her heart was not pre-engaged, &s;he made not the lea&s;t objection to the match. The union pre&s;ented her with the&s;e two ideas, viz. from the gallantry of the gentleman a greater degree of &s;en&s;ual felicity than a &s;in|gle life could admit of, and from his large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, a full indulgence of all her vanity could &s;igh for, or her ambition a&s;pire to.</P>
<P>Hence we may perceive &s;he was &s;trongly influenced by tho&s;e two pa&s;&s;ions, which Mr. Pope &s;ays, predom|inate through the whole &s;ex.
<Q><L>Two principles alone the &s;ex obey,</L>
<L>The love of plea&s;ure, and the love of &s;way,</L>

<P><PB N="55" REF="027335_0054_0FD40B4AD4532000">The hu&s;band who was a profe&s;&s;ed libertine, and had travelled, was too well acquainted with human nature in general, and the fair &s;ex in particular, not to perceive his young con&s;orts &s;anguine di&s;po&s;ition. As pa&s;&s;ion had urged him to the match, the warmth of her con|&s;titution alarmed him into precaution.</P>
<P>She daily grew fonder and fonder of her hu&s;band and fancied the entertained the mo&s;t unbounded affec|tion for him; but he had too much philo&s;ophy not to perceive that her aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">tion originated more from the blood, than the judgement, that it was a kind of volup|tious gratitude, to one who was the principal agent in the indulgence of all her pa&s;&s;ions, and the plea&s;ing grat|ification of her &s;en&s;ations; and not that pure ethereal love which is founded on e&s;teem, and which unites the Platonic refinements to the &s;ympathies of nature:
<Q><L>Which &s;entimentally &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">raphic glows,</L>
<L>Yet in the &s;tream of &s;oft &s;en&s;ation flows.</L></Q></P>
<P>This was the pa&s;&s;ion he wi&s;hed to find. But this &s;ublimity of affection was what his youthful &s;pou&s;e was not qualified to be&s;tow. She was more ardent than delicate, and as a connubial partner, was formed at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to communicate plea&s;ure and create di&s;tru&s;t.</P>
<P>The gentleman, with the &s;crupulous nicety of a Spaniard, was alarmed for his honour; he deemed the warm di&s;po&s;ition of unexperienced frailty, but a brittle tenure for its &s;ecurity. Such, and a thou&s;and &s;imilar ideas pa&s;&s;ing through his imagination, continually &s;our|ed his temper, rendered him &s;u&s;picious and watchful, while his inward anxiety of mind, de&s;troyed that feli|city which had been his only object in the marriage, &s;o little do we know the con&s;equencc of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing what &s;eem&s; mo&s;t de&s;irable, and what we mo&s;t eagerly pur&s;ue, and &s;o totally ignorant are we, of what would prove conducive to our real happine&s;s.</P>

Nothing far &s;hort of angelic purity can &s;atisfy the reformed libertine.</P>
<P>Thus, our gentleman from being particular, became cautious; caution &s;oon degenerated into &s;u&s;picion; &s;u&s;picion bred jealou&s;y, and jealou&s;y rendered him completely mi&s;erable.</P>

<P><HI>Lucilla,</HI> not knowing the true rea&s;on of his ab&s;ence. committed her &s;entiments to writing, to upbraid him for his apparent defection, and recall him to her embraces.</P>
<P>Our hero was much about the &s;ize of <HI>Don Carlos. Lucilla</HI>'s emi&s;&s;ary fuund him walking in the &s;ame place where that Cavalier u&s;ually &s;pent an hour or two every evening.

<P>But <HI>Lucilla</HI> took our hero at his word, in a more lit|eral manner than he either expcted, or de&s;ired; for &s;he declared that &s;he would never admit him to her pre&s;ence again, unle&s;s he appeared the next day in the character of a <HI>Di&s;ciplinarian,</HI> and &s;courged him&s;elf be|fore her window, to evince his affection.</P>

<P>WHEN our hero returned home, he entertained &s;ome qualms in his mind, relative to this en|joined flagellation; he could not help thinking it a very fooli&s;h cu&s;tom, nor could he conceive how a

lover's cutting his fle&s;h to pieces, could be of any u&s;e to his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, he found, though he loved <HI>Lucilla</HI> much, he loved him&s;elf more, and di&s;covered, that a lover may &s;ay a great deal, and mean little, promi&s;e much, and de&s;ign to perform nothing.</P>
<P>His determination was therefore, neither to hurt him|&s;elf, nor lo&s;e his mi&s;tre&s;s; he had an abhorrence for the one, and a contrivance for the other.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of &s;upplying him&s;elf with one of the u&s;ual whips, he &s;ub&s;tituted in its place, a whip to all outward appearance &s;imilar, but in effect, totally different.</P>
<P>The handle was like the common ones, but in lieu of three leather thongs, he had fa&s;tened three &s;mall eel-|&s;kins filled with blood, to the end of it.</P>
<P>Thus provided, he repaired the next day to the Al|cazar Street, and having ju&s;t before he approached <HI>Lu|cilla</HI>'s window, pricked tne &s;kins in &s;everal places, he began to la&s;h him&s;elf to all appearance, in a mo&s;t un|merciful manner.</P>
<P>The blood plentifully i&s;&s;ued from the apertures in the eel-&s;kins: his &s;houlders, back, and &s;ides were dread|fully crim&s;oned over, and appeared in a condition &s;o gha&s;tfully &s;anguine, that even <HI>Lucilla,</HI> u&s;ed as &s;he had been to &s;uch a cu&s;tom, and cruelty vain of &s;uch a token of re&s;pect, thought he had &s;uffered too much, and given a proof &s;ufficiently bloody of a &s;ervent, affection.</P>
<P>She beckoned him to cea&s;e la&s;hing him&s;elf and ap|peared perfectly well &s;atisfied with his exce&s;&s;ive gallantry.</P>
<P>He bowed and retired, walking away as if al|most &s;einting with lo&s;s of blood, but laughing in his &s;leeve at the &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;tratagem, plea&s;ing him&s;elf

<HEAD>CHAPTER XVIII. <HI>Again introduced to the Lady.&mdash;Rewarded for the &s;up|po&s;ed bloody proof of his Affection.&mdash;Treachery of the Duenna.&mdash;Horrid Re&s;olution of Don Carlos.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE en&s;uing evening, our hero repaired to the u&s;ual place, the duenna met him as before, and introduced him to the lady, into who&s;e pre&s;ence he came, in full expectation of a reward for his ingenious deception; and indeed it mu&s;t be admitted, that he was much more de&s;erving of it, than if he had really la&s;hed him&s;elf as &s;he fancied he had, in compliance with a cu&s;tom, at once &s;o cruel and ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>As for the lady, &s;he was &s;atisfied with the di&s;cipline &s;he imagined he had given him&s;elf; this con&s;ideration, joined to the natural warmth of her di&s;po&s;ition, and a kind of prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favor of young Montague, was &s;ufficient to make her recede from any more punctil|ios; &s;he thought he had &s;acrificed enough at the &s;hrine of decorum, and therefore as a ju&s;t &s;aint, to whom as a votary, he had appeared a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly fervent, &s;he deter|mined to reward the ardency of his vows.</P>
<P>In fine, our hero was as happy, as <HI>plea&s;ures mereby &s;en&s;ual</HI> could make him.</P>
<P>But as the lovers became mutually plea&s;ed, the du|enna grew di&s;plea&s;ed. In the cour&s;e of her mi&s;tre&s;s's amour with <HI>Don Carlos,</HI> &s;he had received many valua|ble douceurs; but this was not the ca&s;e with our hero, he had nothing worth her acceptance to give, nor in|deed,
<PB N="68" REF="027335_0066_0FD40B5F68581C18">
did he entertain the idea that &s;uch pre&s;ents were nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Don Carlos,</HI> by the means of friends, and evincing his innocence, he &s;oon obtained his liberty.</P>
<P>The duenna no &s;ooner under&s;tood this, than &s;he made him acquainted, that a happy rival had during his confinement, &s;upplanted him in the affections of his mi&s;tre&s;s; though this rival, &s;he cunningly added, was far his inferior, not only in family and fortune, but in per&s;onal and mental accompti&s;hments.</P>
<P>This information was &s;ufficient to rouze the indigna|tion of <HI>Don Carlos,</HI> who was a true Spaniard as far as a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the local follies oi Spain could go. He thought his honour concerned, he felt his heart touched, and his pride exceedingly hurt. He therefore &s;wore by the blood of an old Chri&s;tian, to have revenge. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Spaniards in general, are exceedingly proud of arrogating to them&s;elves this appellation; by which they in&s;inuate, that they are de&s;cended from an ancient Chri&s;tian family of Old Ca&s;tile, the blood of which hath not been contaminated by any intermarriage, or intermixture with Moors o Jews.</NOTE></P>
<P>We have already mentioned, that when the Span|iards fancy them&s;elves gro&s;ly affronted, they do not &s;eek what in other parts of Europe is called <HI>an honour|able revenge,</HI> but without remor&s;e, have recour&s;e to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. This was the thought that occurred to <HI>Don Carlos,</HI> and our hero was very near falling a vic|tim to his vindictive temper, and the barbarous cu&s;tom of his country.</P>

<P>DON <HI>Carlos,</HI> deeming the office of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in too mean for him&s;elf, employed a Bravo, (that is, one who lets him&s;elf out for hire, to execute the hon|ourable office of murderer) to di&s;pateh his rival.</P>
<P>However, on the evening in which the fatal deed was to be perpetrated, young Montague's fortunate &s;tar happened to predominate; the Bravo, who way-laid him coming from <HI>Lucilla</HI>'s intended to &s;tab him in the heart with a dagger, but our hero luckily giving a &s;ud|den &s;tart, he only &s;lightly wounded him in the &s;houlder.</P>
<P>Chagrined not to have &s;ucceeded, he prepared to repeat his blow, which Montague, apprized of his de|&s;ign, attempted to ward off, by twi&s;ting his cloak round his arm, a thing u&s;ual in Spain, when a rencounter hap|pens: the &s;troke did not &s;ucceed according to the Ruf|fian's wi&s;h; but however, our hero was de&s;perately wounded in the right &s;ide.

<P><PB N="70" REF="027335_0068_0FD40B63160563E0">The ruffian happily left our hero, but the mules turned down another &s;treet, and he remained for &s;ome time weltering in his blood, till his cries were over|heard in a hou&s;e near where he lay.</P>
<P>He waS &s;oon brought in by the &s;ervants, and taken proper care of that night.</P>
<P>This timely benevolence happened to be extended to him by the dome&s;ties of the Engli&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador, near who&s;e hotel he was attacked.</P>
<P>The next day when he was attended by the &s;urgeon who had dre&s;&s;ed his wouads over night, of which, from the lo&s;e of blood, he was then in&s;en&s;ible, he &s;oon per|ceived that he was an Engli&s;hman.</P>
<P>This rejoiced him exceedingly, his misfortune had le&s;&s;ened his avidity for Spani&s;h intrigues, and the lo&s;s of his blood had cured him very expeditiou&s;ly of his pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Lucilla.</HI> He therefore without &s;cruple, in|formed the &s;urgeon who he was, and of every thing which had befallen him &s;ince his la&s;t elopement from &s;chool.</P>
<P>This information was &s;peedily communicated to the amba&s;&s;ador, who no &s;ooner under&s;tood his rank and in di&s;cretion, than he re&s;olved to &s;end him to his friends with all convenient expedition.</P>
<P>His youth, and the &s;kill of the &s;urgeon who attended him, &s;oon re-e&s;tabli&s;hed his health; and the difreli&s;h which he now began to entertain for Spain, made him fall into the amba&s;&s;ador's propo&s;al of &s;ending him to England, with great plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>He accordingly embarked for his native country, and after a plea&s;ant voyage, arrived there in very good health and high &s;pirits.</P>

<P>It was concluded, that he &s;hould no more go to We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool, or any other public &s;eminary of learning, but regain what he had lo&s;t, and complete the remainder of his education at home, under the in&s;par|tion of &s;ome gentlemen, eminent in every branch of u&s;eful and polite literature, who were employed as pri|vate preceptors for that purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>YOUNG Montague's private tuition an&s;wered the mo&s;t &s;anguine wi&s;hes of his relations and friends. His preceptors took uncommon pains, with a genius naturally bright and penetrating, and he repaid their a&s;|&s;iduity by an improvement and per&s;overance in &s;tudy little expected from one of his volatile turn of mind. In fine, he happily blended the polite arts with the more ab&s;tracted &s;ciences and &s;olid parts of philo&s;ophy, and gave the faire&s;t promi&s;e of becoming the complete gentleman.</P>
<P>One evening as he was taking his u&s;ual walk in the Park, a young woman tripped by him with great &s;oem|ing expedition.</P>
<P>The &s;ymmetry of her &s;hape and her nimblene&s;s, at|tracted

his notice; he redoubled his ha&s;te to get again before her, that he might have an opportunity of ob|&s;erving her countenance.</P>
<P>He &s;oon overtook her, and viewed her with admira|tion. She blu&s;hed on noticing the earne&s;tne&s;s of his looks. The crim&s;on glow ot mode&s;ty which over|&s;pread her cheeks, gave an additional charm to her na|tive beauty.</P>
<P>Her features were regular; her complexion to the la&s;t degree lovely; while the brilliancy of her eyes, and ruddine&s;s of her cheeks, be&s;poke both health and vivacity.</P>
<P>She ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to have been but little u&s;ed to compa|ny, or the t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">Ire&s;&s;es of men, by her manife&s;t confu&s;ion; and &s;eemed b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;implicity of her dre&s;s, which was extremely pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> though exceeding neat, not to be above the ordinary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nk</P>
<P>He determined to enter into conver&s;ation with her. At fir&s;t &s;he appeared very coy, but at length gave him pertinent an&s;wers to every que&s;tion he a&s;ked.</P>
<P>From the conver&s;ation he had with her, he found that &s;he was only the daughter of a wa&s;her-woman; that her mother, who was a widow, had &s;ufficient bu&s;i|ne&s;s to enable them to live comfortably; that &s;he a&s;|&s;i&s;ted her mother, and was going to Pimlico to fetch a gentleman's linen for whom they wa&s;hed.</P>
<P>He would fain have engaged her to meet him again, but this &s;he abolutely refu&s;ed, alledging that &s;he would do nothing without the knowledge of her mother; &s;he however at length agreed that he &s;hould call upon her, and gave him her addre&s;s accordingly.</P>
<P>He frequently vi&s;ited her, and having gained upon her affections, made &s;everal flattering propo&s;als to &s;e|duce
<PB N="73" REF="027335_0071_0FD40B6AEBDEE560">
her from her virtue. But he found his endeavors in vain; &s;he had too much mode&s;ty to become the vic|tim of his artifices, and her mother too much affection for her child, as well as vigilance, not to prevent his &s;ucce&s;s by an illicit means.</P>
<P>A negative he had never expected, was a double &s;ti|mulative to his di&s;po&s;ition, naturally amorous and impa|tient; the ob&s;tacles thrown in his way, increa&s;ed the &s;lame that began to con&s;ume him.</P>
<P>He determined to enjoy the fair <HI>Patty,</HI> (for what was our juvenile wa&s;her-woman's name) at any rate. He, therefore, mad with his pa&s;&s;ion, an carele&s;s of the con|&s;equences, propo&s;ed marriage.</P>
<P>This propo&s;al was joyfully <HI>received</HI> both by mother and daughter and the only &s;tipulations which his &s;mall remains of prudence &s;ugge&s;ted, were to keep the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a &s;ecret, untill he became of age, as the publication of &s;uch a &s;ecret might materially affect in future fortune.</P>
<P>This re&s;triction was acceded to by both, for particu|lar rea&s;ons, as they imagined that the marriage being known would be the means of hunting both him and them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Our hero was not only become a poet, put a mighty e&s;&s;ayi&s;t, and having quitted his bed one morning much earlier than u&s;ual, he &s;pent about an hour in penning an <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Prudence,</HI> then dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, and repaired to his pretty wa&s;her-woman, with an intent to commit one of the mo&s;t <HI>Imprudent actions</HI> he had ever done in his life, for he immediately took her to the Fleet and married her.</P>
<P>Though both mother and daughter had promi&s;ed, and indeed knew it to be their intere&s;t, to keep this indi&s;creet &s;tep of our hero's a &s;ecret; yet it did not re|main long &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="027335_0072_0FD40B6BE1C93738">The old woman, who was always fond of exhilarating her &s;pirits, and cheri&s;hing her heart with a vivifying cordial in &s;ecret, thought upon her daughter's good for|tune, that &s;he could not be too bountiful in regaling her neighbours, and pouring forth her thanks in copious li|bations to <HI>Bacchus.</HI></P>
<P>One day in the fulne&s;s of her joy and plenitude of her cups, &s;he could not forbear communicating her hap|pine&s;s to &s;ome of her mo&s;t particular a&s;&s;ociates. She informed them not only of her daughter's &s;ecret mar|riage, but of our hero's rank, family, and expectancies.</P>
<P>This information, in&s;tead of giving plea&s;ure, rai&s;ed the envy of her neighbours; without con&s;idering her ho&s;pitality, they hated her for her good fortune, and mo&s;t of them having daughters, could not without &s;igh|ing &s;ee the &s;ucce&s;s of poor <HI>Patty.</HI> Such is the ca|price of human nature, that our neighbours good &s;eems our bane.</P>
<P>On receiving the intelligence, they had promi&s;ed the old woman the &s;tricte&s;t &s;ecrecy, but as they could not imagine that &s;o unequal a match was concluded with the approbation of our hero's family, they determined it &s;hould not long remain a &s;ecret.</P>
<P>Malice is &s;eldom dilatory in effecting its purpo&s;es; it may therefore be naturally &s;uppo&s;ed, that young Mon|tague's relation and friends were very &s;peedily apprised of his imprudence.</P>
<P>This information gave them more concern than any of his former follies, as it appeared irreparable, the fleet marriage at that time being good in law, and no re&s;tric|tive act having then pa&s;&s;ed to prevent the indi&s;cretion or minors.</P>
<P>But to pre&s;erve as much at po&s;&s;ible the dignity of their family, and the credit of our hero, they thought
<PB N="75" REF="027335_0073_0FD40B6E91092CF0">
proper to enter into a negociation with our newly exalted wa&s;her-woman and her mother, who being threatened, per&s;uaded, and promi&s;ed, and finding what pow|erful people they had to deal with, at length agreed to relinqui&s;h all manner of claim to and upon the young gentleman, to forego his name, pre&s;erve the mo&s;t inviolable &s;ecrecy in future, and retire upon a decent pen&s;ion into the country.</P>

<P>Having &s;ince his abode in Paris con&s;idered politene&s;s as a &s;cience, and &s;tudied it even upon <HI>Che&s;ton f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ldian principles</HI> it may be imag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d that he could not he&s;i|tate to a&s;k the lady to partake of his collation with him.</P>
<P>He paid her that compliment; &s;he accepted of it, for the French are ea&s;y in their manners, and &s;eldom refu&s;e what is offered with a good grace.</P>
<P>Good-humour gave a reli&s;h to their entertainment, and their conver&s;ation was enlivened by repartee.</P>
<P>After they had &s;upped, they &s;at very clo&s;e together, till the conclu&s;ion of the entertainment, when he offer|ed to accommodate her with his carriage to any place &s;he might command.</P>
<P>She accepted his propo&s;al, but &s;lipped from him in the crowd, and on his return home he mi&s;&s;ed his watch, his pur&s;e, and his pocket-book; he had no doubt, but the lady who had partook of his collation, had made free with his property, and his only con&s;olation was, the reflection that he might &s;end &s;ufficiently early in the morning to his banker to &s;top the payment of &s;ome drafts to a con&s;iderable amount, which his pocket-book contained.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="027335_0075_0FD40B711286BCA0">With this idea he went to bed, but &s;lept till it was late in the morning, and not having given any previous direction to his &s;ervant over night to repair to the bank|er before he was up; on &s;ending, he was informed that ca&s;h had already been given for the drafts.</P>

<P>She however perceived enough to find that he would puni&s;h her whenever he met her, though he had not ac|quainted the Police of the affair.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="027335_0076_0FD40B728F54D9B8">This &s;ugge&s;tion led her to keep her&s;elf private, until &s;he could put a &s;cheme, which her vindictive &s;pirit had furni&s;hed her with, into execution.</P>
<P>A few nights afterwards our hero heard a loud knocking at his door at a very late hour.</P>
<P>He looked out of the window and perceived a fiacre<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A hackney-c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ach.</NOTE> very near, and four men at the door.</P>
<P>He enquired who they were; they replied mu&s;que|teers, and that they mu&s;t have immediate admittance.</P>
<P>While he was partying with them, the landlady who heard with terror that tremendous name, opened the &s;treet door.</P>
<P>They immediately bur&s;t in, and ha&s;tening to our he|ro's chamber, broke into the room and &s;eized him with|out ceremony.</P>
<P>He demanded the: rea&s;on of this violent proceeding.</P>
<P>They only replied that they belonged to the Ba&s;tile, and had an order from government to apprehend him.</P>
<P>It was in vain for him to expo&s;tulate, for the only an&s;wer was, that they mu&s;t obey their orders, that he had offended the &s;tate and that their bu&s;ine&s;s was to &s;eize his per&s;on and &s;eal up his effects.</P>
<P>To re&s;i&s;t was impo&s;&s;ible and they prevented him from crying out by gagging him.</P>
<P>Then dragging him to the fiacre, two of them con&s;t|ned him there, while the others were busied in &s;ealing up his effects, as they pretended.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="027335_0077_0FD40B772A143B68">When they had effected their purpo&s;e, they all four drove away in the coach with him; but before they had gone far, had the precaution to blindfold him.</P>
<P>Having drove for a con&s;iderable time, they at length &s;topped, and taking him out of the fiac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, led him he knew not whither.</P>
<P>They now bound him fa&s;t to &s;omething; he entreat|ed to know the rca&s;on of his commitment; if they could inform him.</P>
<P>At length one of them a&s;ked him if he had not lately lo&s;t a pocket-book.</P>
<P>He replied in the affirmative, at the &s;ame time telling them that he had not only; lo&s;t his pocket book, but his watch and his money.</P>
<P>As for the watch and the money, returned the per&s;on who appeared the mo&s;t communicative of the four, we know nothing about, nor indeed of the manner in which you lo&s;t the whole; but this we know, that your pock|et-book, by &s;ome means fell into the hands of govern|ment, who found &s;ome offen&s;ive papers therein, which have occa&s;ioned your apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>Having given him this information, they rifled his pockets and left him.</P>
<P>In this di&s;mal &s;ituation he began to ruminate on the misfortune which had befallen him: he recollected that in his.pocket-book there was a &s;aty<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ical poem, or kind of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eud' e&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t</HI> entitled <HI>Royal Ahsurdities,</HI> in which he had &s;everely la&s;hed &s;ome of the follies to which his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty was addicted.</P>
<P>This he had no doubt was the cffen&s;ive paper allu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed to; but how it fill into the hands of government, after having had his pocket picked of it, he could not conceive.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="027335_0078_0FD40B78A074BB28">Indeed he conjectured that either the per&s;on, who had picked his pocket, after taking out the drafts and valuable papers, had thrown it away, and &s;ome per&s;on finding it, had, on account of that poem, delivered it to the mini&s;try, who &s;oon came to me knowledge of the author, by his name being on the cover of the book, and then had ordered him to be apprehended; or that the lady, who had robbed him, finding that unfortunate paper, had thought it prudent to make her peace with the <HI>police,</HI> by &s;acrificing him to <HI>admini&s;tration.</HI> For in the arbitrary government of France, an offence again&s;t maje&s;ty will &s;upercede any again&s;t the public at large.</P>
<P>Terrified at the thoughts of being in the Ba&s;tile, and wearied with a thou&s;and conjectures, he remained under the mo&s;t di&s;mal apprehen&s;ions till morning, when he was &s;urprized at hearing a voice &s;aying, <HI>What do you here</HI>?</P>
<P>The ab&s;urdity of this interrogatory puzzled him ex|ceedingly, more particularly as he thought the per&s;on who uttered it, as one belonging to the pri&s;on, mu&s;t know that he was gagged, and con&s;equently unable to an&s;wer it.</P>
<P>At length the bandage was taken from his eyes; and to his amazement, in&s;tead of the di&s;mal walls of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l to circum&s;eribe his view, he beheld the glorious expan&s;e of the heavens above his head, and a number of fruit|trees around him; and in lieu of an inhuman <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er with a horrid a&s;pect, he &s;aw a pea&s;ant, with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">les of innocence on his countenance, who appeared to en|joy the &s;ingularity of his fituation, and to be laughing at him.</P>
<P>He pointed to his month, the good-natured country|man conceived his meaning, and immediately relea&s;ed him from the gag.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he had a little recovered from his &s;urprise
<PB N="81" REF="027335_0079_0FD40B7A1C3BFF30">
and brought his jaws, (which had been terribly di&s;tended) into &s;ome degree of compo&s;ure, he exclaim|ed in his turn, <Q>Where am I, and who brought me here?</Q></P>
<P><Q>As to where you are, replied the pea&s;ant, I can inform you; you are tied to a pear-tree in my orchard, from which confinement I will now relea&s;e you, but as to who brought you here, I cannot tell, unle&s;s the devil was concerned in it.</Q></P>
<P>Our hero let the pea&s;ant know as much of the affair as he thought proper: the poor fellow took him into his cottage, and refre&s;hed him with all the place could afford; he then conducted him towards Paris, which was at the di&s;tance of about a league.</P>
<P>Montague, who was naturally generous, took him home to reward his ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>When he came there, he found his tutor under the utmo&s;t concern for him; being alarmed by the di&s;mal account he had received from the landlady.</P>
<P>Montague, having been &s;tripped of all his money, borrowed &s;ufficient of his tutor to reward the pea&s;ant amply, who returned home perfectly well &s;ati&s;fied.</P>
<P>Our hero, on examining, found that the&s;e gentry, in|&s;tead of carefully fealing up his effects, had plundered him of every thiag valuable.</P>
<P>The whole my&s;tery was now unriddled; he ea&s;ily conceived the bottom of the affair for it was evident that the&s;e &s;ham mu&s;queteers were emi&s;&s;aries and ac|complices of the lady who had &s;o dexterou&s;ly picked his pocket; by the direction on his pocket-book they &s;ound out the place of his re&s;idence, and the libel before mentioned, gave them the idea, as a colourable pretext of &s;eizing his per&s;on in order to make them&s;elves ma&s;|ters

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING his accumulated and great lo&s;&s;es, be determined not to apprize the Po|lice of his misfortunes.</P>
<P>The artificers of this courtezan, and re&s;olution of her Myrmadons, were too fre&s;h in his memory to permit him to entertain any idea of redre&s;s; for he had no doubt, but was he to attempt to &s;tir in the affair, a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ination would be the inevitable con&s;equence; and being relea&s;ed from the terrours of the Ba&s;tile, &s;eemed a &s;olatary con&s;olation for his heavy lo&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>He wrote to England for remittances, and letters of credit upon Holland, determining to vi&s;it that place be|fore he went to Italy, for he now began to grow di&s;|gu&s;ted with France.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as his remittances arrived, he &s;at off by land; nothing material happened during his journey, at lea&s;t nothing worth relating, and the places through which he pa&s;&s;ed, have been &s;o frequently and accurately de&s;cribed, that it is unnece&s;&s;ary to mention them. Nor &s;hall we in the cour&s;e of this work, copy the trite &s;enti|ments of other travellers, or the backneyed de&s;criptions of well known places, which are to be found in other authors. We neither write as geographers, ichnogra|phers or navigators, but mean to pre&s;ent our readers with the mo&s;t remarkable advantures which be&s;ol this

&s;ingular per&s;onage, and it the &s;ame time not to omit any thing curious relative to the countries through which he travelled.</P>
<P>According to our plan, therefore, as Holland is a country &s;o univer&s;ally well known, we &s;hall not trouble the reader with any prolix narrations or local de&s;crip|tions, but pa&s;s to the only adventure worthy of record, which be&s;el him during his re&s;idence in the United Provinces.</P>
<P>At Am&s;terdam he became intimate with a Jew bro|ker, who tran&s;acted bu&s;ine&s;s for him.</P>
<P>This broker had a daughter who, though a brunette, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t regular &s;et of features imaginable, and had killing eyes.</P>
<P>She was vivacious and witty, but very po&s;itive and mighty fond of the ceremonials of the Mo&s;aic law.</P>
<P>The charms of pretty <HI>Judith,</HI> for &s;o was our Jewe&s;s named, &s;oon awakened all that was amorous in the compo&s;ition of our hero.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, as u&s;ual, he attempted &s;eduction, but his ar|tifices not &s;ucceeding, he propo&s;ed marriage. This mode of proceeding &s;eems to have been our hero's in|variable condact through the whole of his eccentric life.</P>
<P><HI>Judith,</HI> knowing his rank and fortune, was proud of her conque&s;t, and fond of his propo&s;al, as &s;he could not be indifferent to his per&s;on and accompli&s;hments.</P>
<P>It is true, &s;he was &s;carce turned of thirteen years of age, but that made no difference to nither. For, as on his part, youth could he no objection to a voluptuary; &s;o on her's the want of a lover appeared more terrible than want of years.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="027335_0082_0FD40B832C329728">No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> could her juvenility be any impediment in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of her father; for, (by the laws of the Talmud) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ws are allowed to marry at eighteen, and the daughters when they have completed twelve years and a day.</P>

<P>ONE &s;tipulation, however, the old Jew in&s;i&s;ted up|on, which was, that our hero &s;hould con&s;ent to be married after the Jewi&s;h ceremonial, and not accord|ing to the Chri&s;tian ritual.</P>
<P>To this, Montague had no objection; his fondne&s;s of novelty, without any other motive, would have in|duced him to come into the propo&s;al; but in fact he well knew that he was legally married to his pretty wa&s;her-woman, and that it was immaterial by what ce|remony he joined him&s;elf to any other woman. Add to this, he had no very delicate notions of moral recti|tude; his pa&s;&s;ion was &s;en&s;ual; he wi&s;hed to enjoy our
<PB N="85" REF="027335_0083_0FD40B84982AC868">
pretty Jewe&s;s, and left to her and her father to fix upon the form by which he was to obtain the gratification of his de&s;ires.</P>
<P>The preleminaries being &s;ettled, the nuptial ceremo|ny was &s;oon after performed.</P>
<P>As there is &s;omething very curious in a Jew marriage, and as many of our readers may be unacquainted with that ceremony, we &s;hall pre&s;ent them with an ac|count of it.</P>
<P>Previous to the marriage, &s;everal of the friends meet in a convenient place, each having in his hand an ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> en ve&s;&s;el; the contract is then read, notice given of the day of marriage, and a declaration made, that the party who &s;hall not &s;tand to what is agreed, is to pay to the other a &s;tipulated &s;um.</P>
<P>Then wi&s;hing happine&s;s to each other, the young Jews throw their ve&s;&s;els upon the ground, concluding (as the Jews &s;ay) that the breaking of them portends plenty and good fortune. But we are rather inclined to think, that this part of the ceremony is an emblem of the frailty of our worldly purpo&s;es and delights.</P>
<P>On their departure a per&s;on at the door pre&s;ents ev|ery one with a gla&s;s of wine, and &s;ome comfits. This is emblematical of chearfulne&s;s and plenty.</P>
<P>He that is to ble&s;s the marriage takes a gla&s;s of wine, and having given it his benediction, pre&s;ents it to the married couple to drink; this is to &s;ignify that we owe a grateful acknowledgment of all our plenty to the bounty of the Almighty. The young couple then mu&s;t not &s;tir abroad for eight days, during which &s;pace their friends are, however, permitted to vi&s;it and make merry with them.</P>
<P>The day previous to the marriage, the woman is put
<PB N="86" REF="027335_0084_0FD40B861F827F70">
into a bath of cold water, by the re&s;t of her &s;ex, who make a hideous noi&s;e while they are bathing her.</P>
<P>The bridegroom then &s;ends a matrimonial girdle to the bride, with a gold buckle; the bride returns a &s;im|ilar pre&s;ent, with this difference, that the buckle is &s;il|ver; this &s;ignifies that the man does more honor to the woman by taking her to be his wife, than &s;he does to him, by admitting him to be her lord and ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>On the nuptial day, the bride is conducted to a chamber appointed for that purpo&s;e, by women who &s;ing and dance before her, for a double motive; as they look upon &s;uch chearfulne&s;s to be both acceptable to God, and a preventive of gloomine&s;s or low &s;pirits, which would appear as bad omens.</P>
<P>When the bridegroom is to receive the benediction, four young men carry a canopy into a garden or open place, beneath which the &s;olemnity is performed.</P>
<P>The bridegroom, accompanied by the males, and the bride by the females, preceded by mu&s;ic, meet under the canopy; every one &s;aying, <Q><HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be he that cometh.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The bridegroom then walks three times round the bride, and takes her by the hand.</P>
<P>The company then &s;catter corn on them both, re|peating at the &s;ame time the &s;cripture phra&s;e, <HI>cre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cite et multiplicamini,</HI> that is <HI>increa&s;e and multiply.</HI> Thence probably aro&s;e the cu&s;tom of having <HI>bride cakes</HI> among Chri&s;tians. The whole is allegorical of an increa&s;e both in children and &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>The bride then holds the bridegroom by the hand, and turns her face to the &s;outh, or to the meridian &s;un, which is the emblem of genral and procreative power.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="027335_0085_0FD40B881BE0FE50">The <HI>Rabbi</HI> then taking a gla&s;s of wine, and rehear&s;|ing the <HI>mahzor</HI> prayers, gives it to the married couple to drink; if the bride is a virgin, he gives her a narrow gla&s;s; if a widow a wide one. Then receiving a plain gold ring, the <HI>Rabbi</HI> a&s;ks if it is gold; on being an|&s;wered in the affirmative, he puts it on the bride's &s;ec|ond &s;inger, and reads the manage contract.</P>
<P>Then taking another gla&s;s of wine, and giving thanks to God, that the new married couple have plighted their troth, he pre&s;ents it them to drink again; the bridegroom having drank, throws the gla&s;s with all his force again&s;t the wall of ground, in order to break it in remembrance of the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>Then black caps are placed on both their heads, to &s;hew they are afflicted for the de&s;truction of the temple, even in their greate&s;t rejoicings.</P>
<P>Being led to a banquet, the bridegroom &s;ings a kind of a hymn, then an egg and a hen, ready dre&s;&s;ed are &s;et before him; he pre&s;ents a &s;mall piece to his bride, and immediately the company &s;cramble for the re&s;t, and whoever gets the large&s;t piece, is e&s;teemed the mo&s;t fortunate.</P>
<P>The egg is then pre&s;ented to the bride, as a progno&s;|tic of her bearing children, as ea&s;ily as the hen her eggs.</P>
<P>They then &s;it down to a fea&s;t; after which a dance begins; the noble&s;t per&s;on in the company takes the bridegroom by the hand, he another, and &s;o the re&s;t till they all join.</P>
<P>The principal woman takes the bride by the hand, and the re&s;t of the women join, in a &s;imilar manner to the men. Thus the dance is long and confu&s;ed, and the wedding, or rather the rejoicings, continue eight days.</P>

<P>OUR hero for &s;ome time was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of his young bride, but at length his natural vola|tility and &s;icklene&s;s prevailed, and he grew &s;atiated with the enjoyment of that to which he found no ob&s;tacle.

<P>HE landed at Leghorn, and after &s;taying in that place a &s;hort time, where nothing material hap|pened, he traver&s;ed the Italian States, ob&s;erved what hath been a thou&s;and times ob&s;erved and &s;aw what hath been a thou&s;and times &s;een. He was, (as is u&s;ual with young travellers) a&s;toni&s;hed at the Roman anti|quities; in raptures with the paintings of the Italian ma&s;ters: in extacies with their mu&s;ic; in admiration of their women, and intoxicated by their wines.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="027335_0088_0FD40B8C1182F4B8">He made &s;ome &s;tay at Genoa, which, from the &s;ea, he ob&s;erved affords one of the fine&s;t pro&s;pects in the world, as it &s;tands partly on the declivity of a hill, and partly on a flat next to the &s;hore.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es are very lofty, and &s;inely painted on the out&s;ide, which gives them a fine and &s;plendid appearance.</P>
<P>The Genoe&s;e are indu&s;trious, cunning and more hardy than the re&s;t of the Italians.</P>
<P>As for jealou&s;y, of which the Italians are generally accu&s;ed, the Genoe&s;e ought to be exempted from the charge, for their women are allowed as many liberties, and indeed take as many, as any &s;et of people in the world. Hence the Italian proverb, which &s;ays, that the <Q>Genoe&s;e have a &s;ea without fi&s;h! land without trees! men without faith! and women without &s;hame!</Q></P>
<P>Here our hero was under the nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing the arts of &s;eduction, or making matrimonial propo&s;als.</P>
<P>Money &s;oon procured him a mi&s;tre&s;s, who was beau|tiful and witty, but licentious in her principles, and di&s;|agreeable in her temper, &s;o that Mr. Montague &s;oon grew tired of her; for though &s;he took whatever free|doms &s;he thought proper, without the lea&s;t mode&s;t con|&s;ideration, &s;he was jealous of him to an exce&s;s, and &s;o exceedingly capricious, that he determined to free him|&s;elf from the unea&s;ine&s;s &s;he gave him, by quitting the place.</P>
<P>He proceeded to Sicily, and traver&s;ed the whole of that territory. He found the Sicilians polite, courte|ous, fond of magni&s;icence, and generous, but vindictive to the la&s;t degree; to evince which, the following fact will be &s;ufficient. For the &s;pirit of the modern Sicil|ians greatly re&s;embles that of their ance&s;tors.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="027335_0089_0FD40B8C1570B178">In the reign of the emperor Charles the Vth, a &s;o|ciety was formed at Trapani, under the title of "The &s;ociety of St. Paolo;" the members of which, made a vow to take cognizance not only of the proceedings of their neighbours, and the lower order of the inhabitants of the town, but even of their magi&s;trates and nobility.</P>
<P>Whoever was condemned by this &s;ociety, was cer|tain of death; for one of the members was deputed to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the obnoxious party, and the per&s;on &s;o cho&s;en to the office of murderer, was obliged without any ex|cu&s;e, privately to de&s;troy, the per&s;on, &s;o clande&s;tinely condemned.</P>
<P>The women of Sicily are beautiful, amorous, and ex|ceedingly fruitful, for &s;ome of them have been known to have had three ox four and twenty children.</P>
<P>Sicily is likewi&s;e deemed the granary of Europe, be|ing, perhaps, the riche&s;t place for grain in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>From Sicily our hero failed in a little bark, manned by one helms-man and two rowers, to the i&s;le of Ghoz|zo.

<P>PROCEEDING to Malta, he found that i&s;land cul|tivated much in the &s;ame manner as Ghozzo.</P>
<P>The Knights of Malta have rendered the manners of the inhabitants &s;o depraved, that there is &s;carce an hon|e&s;t female in the whole i&s;land, except what belongs to the &s;ailors. For the&s;e fellows, who are ready to &s;acri|fice their blood for the &s;ake of religion, and to do any thing for the intere&s;t of the Grand Ma&s;ter, are never|thele&s;s extremely tenacious of the honour of their wives and daughters: if therefore, any female belonging to them, is forced or decoyed from them, the &s;educer is &s;ure of death. The women belonging to all the other inhabitants are at their di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>The town of Catania at the foot of mount AEtna, which was de&s;troyed by the dreadful earthquake in 1693 is now rebuilding, not with &s;tone or brick, but with, the <HI>lava</HI> di&s;gorged from the mouth of that tremendous mountain. The &s;treets are regular but the hou&s;es low, in order the better to &s;u&s;tain the &s;hock of any future earthquake.

<P>The following <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">dote is related as a fact, at Paler|mo. <Q>A prince of one of the fir&s;t families had a &s;e|cret con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">n with a &s;ingle lady, who was his equal

in rank; at length he married her, but two months after marriage &s;he was delivered of a &s;on; from a motive of &s;hame, the parents determined to deny the child, and to tru&s;t its education to a pea&s;ant.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This was kept a &s;ecret till the mother, on her death bed, di&s;covered it. The youth being &s;ent for, &s;hewed more &s;urpri&s;e than joy, on being informed of his rank; but declared, that unle&s;s he was permitted to marry a young country girl, with whom he was in love, he would not accept of any advantage they might offer him. This article being denied him, he willingly re&s;igned his claim, in favour of his brother, returned to the country, and lived happily with the object of his heart in the &s;tation in which he had been brought up.</Q> A rare example of con&s;tancy! and worthy of imitation. Our hero made it his bu&s;i|ne&s;s to vi&s;it this happy couple, at their little town, and was mightily plea&s;ed with their apparent conjugal felicity.</P>
<P>Our hero ob&s;erved, that though the power of the Pope was greatly on the decline, and his domination, in Italy con&s;iderably circum&s;cribed, yet the eccle&s;ia&s;tical patrimony is exceedingly fruitful and rich, which gives ri&s;e to the Italian &s;aying, <Q>That the Pope has the fle&s;h, and the Great Duke of Tu&s;cany the bones of Italy.</Q></P>
<P>At Naples a very fine lady would willingly have en|gaged him as her Ceci&s;beo; that is, (as an ob&s;equious gallant) to play with her, and lo&s;e what money &s;he &s;he thinks proper to win; to be at a thou&s;and expences in order to indulge her caprices; to murder all his time in her &s;ervice, e&s;cort her to every place of public re&s;ort, and privately to admini&s;ter to her libidinous Plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>This lady was the wife of a principal Neapolitan no|bleman. For the ladies in Italy are permitted, by their hu&s;bands, to entertain lovers of this character. Cu&s;tom

hath e&s;tabli&s;hed this infamous practice; the women look upon it as one of their privileges, and the men are &s;o afraid of offending again&s;t &s;o prevalent a fa&s;hion, that they quietly acquie&s;ce with their di&s;honor, and even ca|re&s;s their wives gallants.</P>
<P>Our hero however thought proper to reject the favor de&s;igned him; though he was not over delicate in his amours, yet he had too much &s;entiment to bear the idea of dividing the affections of a woman with another, or &s;haring her per&s;onal charms, with a rival; how|ever that rival might be entitled to her principal con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Nor could he bear the thoughts of having his liberty &s;o much abridged, as &s;uch a piece of gallantry would have rendered nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>He loved to pur&s;ue plea&s;ure, not to be pur&s;ued by it, nor, however, plea&s;ing &s;uch cu&s;toms may be to the Ita|lians, could he approve of being a &s;lave at all times to the &s;atisfaction of another, when, perhaps his own incli|nation pointed a different way.</P>

<P>OUR hero's delicacy, however, in rejecting the over|tures of the Italian lady, had very near co&s;t him his life. For the hu&s;band took it as an affr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt, that any man &s;hould have the in&s;olence to refu&s;e becoming the Ceci&s;beo of a lady of his wife's rank and di&s;tingui&s;hed beauty; he, therefore, &s;ent him a formal challenge up|on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="027335_0093_0FD40B92CCBA5CA0">Our hero was &s;urpri&s;ed at the unaccountable humour of the&s;e people, and that the manners of even poli&s;hed nations &s;hould be &s;o diametrically oppo&s;ite to each other. In England, Holland, France, Germany, and Spain, if one man attempts the honor of another's wife, he runs the hazard of having his throat cut; but in Italy if you refu&s;e to cuckold a man, according to the polite cu&s;tom of the place, you are liable to be run through the body, even by the hu&s;band him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Our hero, who was not deficient in per&s;onal courage, accepted the challenge; the parties met, fought, and the hu&s;band was di&s;armed. Thus fortune decided, that his brow &s;hould not be equipped either by laurels or horns, at lea&s;t upon that occa&s;ion; as doubtle&s;s from the natural temperature of the lady, it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that he did not die without the latter dignity.</P>
<P>The lady was greatly exa&s;perated to be di&s;appointed both in her de&s;ires and revenge, and therefore determin|ed (according to the Italian mode) to take off our hero by poi&s;on; of this intention he was &s;ecretly apprized by a friend, which determined him to leave, with all expe|dition, a place where the inhabitants were &s;o ab&s;urd in their notions, and &s;o litigious and revengeful in their tempers.</P>
<P>For the bigne&s;s of the place, there are perhaps, more lawyers in Naples than any other part of the world; a certain proof of the litigious &s;pirit of the people. It is a&s;&s;erted, that when <HI>Pope Innocent</HI> XI had de&s;ired the <HI>Marquis de Carpio,</HI> the viceroy at Naples to furni&s;h him with 30,000 head of &s;wine, the Marquis replied, that with re&s;pect to his &s;wine, he could not &s;pare them; but if his holine&s;s had occa&s;ion for 30,000 lawyers, they were at his &s;ervice.</P>

<P>They then &s;teered between the celebrated rocks of Scylla and Charybdis, which are not near &s;o dangerous as they have been formerly repre&s;ented; indeed every place and circum&s;tance which had been de&s;cribed by the ancients prove that writers as well as poets have ex|aggerated.</P>
<P>They pa&s;&s;ed Corfu and &s;teered towards Zante; an i&s;|land famous for two remarkable fountains of pitch.</P>
<P>Here they were pur&s;ued by a pirate; for the coa&s;ts of Greece and Barbary &s;warm with Cor&s;airs.

<P>Their police is excellent, perhaps the be&s;t in the univer&s;e. They have very few phy&s;icians here, fewer apothecaries, and no &s;urgeons at all.</P>

<P>When we mourn for the dead, we wear black. They wear blue or violet colour; indeed In this par|ticular, many countries differ.

<P>THE only time that Mr. Montague, during the cour&s;e of his life, &s;eemed inclined to con&s;tancy, Fortune appeared determined to cro&s;s his laudable in|clinations, by depriving him of the beautiful and ac|compli&s;hed <HI>Fatima.</HI></P>
<P>This lady died in child-bed, as did the infant of which &s;he was pregnant.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="027335_0102_0FD40BA05DC49330">Our hero was &s;en&s;ibly affected by this lo&s;s, as he &s;in|cerely loved this lady.</P>
<P>As his melancholy grew upon him, and &s;eemed to injure his health, his friends advi&s;ed him to travel, in or|der to blunt the edge of affliction.</P>
<P>This advice he the more readily received, as he had always found travelling, not only agreeable to his natu|ral curio&s;ity, but a certain &s;pecific again&s;t melancholy of every kind.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of this re&s;olution, he begged the Grand S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gnior's permi&s;&s;ion to depart from Con&s;tantinople.</P>
<P>His &s;ublime highne&s;s was unwilling to part from him, but out of regard to his health, gave him leave to go, and furni&s;hed him with proper pa&s;&s;ports to all parts of his exten&s;ive empire.</P>
<P>His curio&s;ity led him to &s;ee all that was curious in Greece, and to compare the ruins and mi&s;erable &s;tate of that now wretched country, with its former &s;plendor and magnificence.</P>
<P>He vi&s;ited all the places which are u&s;ually vi&s;ited by &s;trangers, and examined all tho&s;e remarkable antiqui|ties, which have been &s;o frequently and minutely de|&s;cribed by travellers.</P>
<P>He perceived that the Greek ladies were remarkably hand&s;ome, and that their limbs were formed with that beautiful &s;ymmetry of proportion, which is ob&s;ervable in the works of their ancient &s;tatuaries. Indeed noth|ing can be more maje&s;tic or lovely than their per&s;ons; but to balance their beauty, they are exceedingly igno|rant, very proud, and very coquetti&s;h; not but a kind of natural politene&s;s makes &s;ome amends for their want of the poli&s;h of education.</P>
<P>He had the curio&s;ity to a&s;cend the celebrated mount
<PB N="105" REF="027335_0103_0FD40BA060994A88">
Ida, but was greatly di&s;appointed, for in&s;tead of meet|ing with tho&s;e beautiful pro&s;pects, which the exagger|ated de&s;criptions of the ancients naturally led him to expect, he found it to be nothing but a prodigious large barren rock, without the lea&s;t land&s;cape to be &s;een, to make any amends for the trouble of climbing it.</P>
<P>After having &s;een the famous labyrinth of Gortyna, he proceeded to Candia, which city, when in the hands of the Venetians, &s;u&s;tained a &s;iege by the Turks, which la&s;ted above twice as long as that of Troy, that is, from the year 1645 to 1669.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of Candia, (or Crete, as it was an|ciently called) were always celebrated as excellent arch|ers, and even to this day are &s;killed in the u&s;e of the bow, as Mr. Montague &s;aw upon &s;everal occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Greek pea&s;ants here, wear a red leather cap, a ve&s;t, and a pair of blue callico drawers, very wide, and &s;o deep behind, as to be ridiculous. In the country they wear &s;hort boots of Turkey leather, which are very neat and la&s;ting; but in the towns they wear pumps or &s;lippers.</P>
<P>The women wear an upper garment of reddi&s;h cloth, full of plaits, with long &s;leeves, but put on in &s;uch a manner, as to leave their brea&s;ts naked.</P>
<P>He then proceeded to Naxia, which is deemed one of the mo&s;t fertile and agreeable i&s;lands of the Archipe|lago; as the country is &s;o plea&s;ant, every one who can afford it, keeps a country hou&s;e.</P>
<P>As the gentlemen of Naxia frequently retire to their villa's, it is humorous enough to ob&s;erve the whim&s;ical vanity of the Greek ladies, who, on retiring to the coun|try, or to the town, are attended by thirty or forty women, &s;ome on &s;oot, &s;ome mounted upon a&s;&s;es, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch of the&s;e carries upon her head, or in her hand.

For in&s;tance, one carries a pair of &s;tockings. another a petticoat, a third an earthen di&s;h, &amp;c. Thus they enter the city, the lady riding at the head of the calvacade, the children in the middle, and the hu&s;band on his mule, clo&s;ing the pompous proce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>After having taken a view of the i&s;le of Paros, which produces the fine&s;t marble in the world, Mr. Montague proceeded to Thermia, which receives its name from &s;ome remarkable hot &s;prings with which the i&s;land abounds.</P>
<P>Here Mr. Montague &s;aw a beautiful Greek girl, who&s;e charms ea&s;ily made an impre&s;&s;ion on a heart &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of tender emotions, and &s;eemed at once to bani&s;h his melancholy, and obliterate the memory of the lovely <HI>Fatima.</HI></P>
<P>Though the Greeks are not &s;o re&s;erved as the other nations, &s;ubject to the Ottoman &s;overeigns, yet their women are mode&s;t.</P>
<P>Our pretty Grecian, therefore, &s;tood upon punctilios, when Mr. Montague, not to lo&s;e time, or have any un|nece&s;&s;ary trouble, had recour&s;e to his old maxim, and freely propo&s;ed marriage: Matrimony now being &s;o fa|miliar to him, that the mo&s;t tri&s;ling inclination would have induced him to marry almo&s;t any woman, on con|dition it was in a country where the law could not take cognizance of the affair.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable circum&s;tances in the marriage ceremonies of the Greeks are the&s;e.</P>
<P>The bride is obliged to let her hu&s;band know what fortune &s;he has, and he is under the nece&s;&s;ity of acting in the &s;ame candid manner: the men &s;itting round a long table, the women on benches rai&s;ed behind it.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="027335_0105_0FD40BA2E52EDC20">When the bride receives the u&s;ual pre&s;ents from the relations and gue&s;ts, &s;he &s;its with a gilt crown on her head, in the mid&s;t of the <HI>gincco,</HI> or women's apartment.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they have all drank wine and eaten &s;weet|meats, they make an excur&s;ion to take the air, then they return to &s;upper, after which, the new married couple go to bed together, without any farther ceremony or publication, as among the Roman Catholicks.</P>
<P>This compendious method of marrying was mighty plea&s;ing to our hero, who was no friend to long ce|remonies.</P>
<P>Indeed the young Greek under&s;tood &s;o well the art of plea&s;ing, that &s;he fixed his wavering heart to con&s;tan|cy much longer than could have been expected; for her beauty and blandi&s;hments prevailed over his &s;icklene&s;s, during the &s;pace of two years, in which he never left her, except to make a few excur&s;ions, in order to take a &s;urvey of tho&s;e parts of Greece, which he had not hi|therto &s;een.</P>

Four things &s;hould never flatter us, <Q>Familiarity with princes, the care&s;&s;es of women, the &s;miles of our enemies, and a warm day in winter!</Q> for the&s;e things are not of long duration.</P>
<P>Mr. Montague did not find Egypt to be that fertile country which it has been repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>By Egypt is under&s;tood a narrow tract of land, divid|ed in two by the river Nile, inclo&s;ed with high moun|tains on the ea&s;t and we&s;t, beginning at the cataracts and ending near Cairo, together with what is called the Delta.</P>
<P>The length of Egypt from north to &s;outh, is about 600 miles, the breadth in the Delta is 120 miles, but in the middle of the other part only 21.</P>
<P>They have but one harve&s;t in the year in Egypt, any more than in other places, though it hath been errone|ou&s;ly reported that they have two.</P>
<P>Egypt can hardly &s;upply its inhabitants with corn; many of the people live chie&s;ly upon barley-&s;lour, mixed with water; indeed half of them do not eat bread above once a week, and that bread is not made of wheat, but of coar&s;e millet.</P>
<P>The &s;oil is clayey, mixed with &s;alt petre, which ren|ders
<PB N="110" REF="027335_0108_0FD40BA9544A4A48">
the land &s;o &s;terile, that few plants or &s;hrubs grow upon it; neither tree or wood will vegetate there, with|out being frequently watered; therefore neither timber nor wood for fuel grow in Egypt.</P>
<P>The va&s;t rains which fall in Aby&s;&s;inia and Ethiopia, occa&s;ion the overflowings of the Nile. This river be|gins to &s;well at the latter end of May or beginning of June, when the north winds &s;et in, and about the 24th of September, the waters begin to fall.</P>
<P>It hath been &s;aid that it never rains in Egypt, but that is a mi&s;take, it frequently rains in lower Egypt, but in middle Egypt very rarely, and in upper Egypt never.</P>
<P>The air of this country is very unhealthy, mo&s;t of the people are afflicted with bad eyes, the humour of which is &s;o inveterate, that abundance lo&s;e their &s;ight, &s;o that Egypt may well be called proverbially the <HI>Land of the blind.</HI></P>
<P>A few hours after Mr. Montague's arrival at Grand Cairo, he was witne&s;s to the opening the canal, when the waters of the Nile entered that city. The joy of the people was inexpre&s;&s;ible, and indeed it is very natu|ral it &s;hould, as they are much in want of water.</P>
<P>In the road from Minie to Cairo there is a fine pyra|mid at Beni&s;uef. The Arabs &s;ay, that <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Jacob</HI> built it. Fifteen miles lower there are two more, in the form of a hat; and about nine miles far|ther, at Sacarra, are thirteen large and a great number of &s;maller pyramids, but the greater part of the latter are fallen into ruins.</P>
<P>Cairo is &s;uppo&s;ed to contain as many inhabitants as London. There are &s;even hundred and twenty mo&s;ques in it with prie&s;ts, four hundred and thirty without, and &s;eventy public baths.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="027335_0109_0FD40BAAE7E257A8">The &s;treets are narrow, crooked, and without pave|ment, con&s;equently du&s;ty. The hou&s;es have many &s;to|ries, and flat roofs; they are built of brick; the win|dows have iron <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ails, and curtains to them.

<P>He accordingly &s;et out for Terane, a place about 42 miles, di&s;tant from Cairo, &s;ituated on that branch of the Nile which goes to Ro&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ta, laving applied to the go|vernor, he ordered &s;ome Arabs to attend him.</P>
<P>They joined a drove of camels, who were bound to

the de&s;art of Scete, to procure Natrum. On the road they &s;aw the ruins of various towns; after pa&s;&s;ing along a &s;andy plain, interfected by torrents, they arrived at the lake, which is 24 miles long, and two broad.</P>
<P>The &s;alt had formed a cru&s;t over the lake, which bore the whole company, and their camels.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed over, Mr. Montague left the caravan and went to a Coptic Mona&s;tery, where the monks &s;hew|ed him a &s;tone, which greatly re&s;embled wood, and which, they &s;aid, was part of a ma&s;t belonging to one of the petrified &s;hips.</P>
<P>The next day he arrived at the lake without water, which is only a number of torrents united in one, and dry all the &s;ummer. The petrified &s;hips are nothing but pointed rocks, buried in the &s;and; they re&s;emble &s;hips at a di&s;tance, and look very much like wood. Some pieces are &s;cattered about, which are &s;ix or &s;even feet in length, and five or &s;ix inches in diameter, and the&s;e are what are taken for pieces of ma&s;ts.</P>
<P>At the Coptic Mona&s;tery, which is very mean, and does not de&s;erve a de&s;cription, they told him this ridi|culous &s;tory; That formerly &s;ome Arabians arrived in &s;hips, in their lake without water; that the&s;e Arabians having been very trouble&s;ome to the hermits of the place, St. <HI>Ephraim,</HI> who was then abbot of the mona&s;|tery, prayed to God to dry up the lake; this God not only granted, but changed their &s;hips into &s;tone.</P>
<P>On the road from this place to the mona&s;tery of St. <HI>Macarius,</HI> there are three de&s;erted gla&s;s hou&s;es.</P>
<P>It may not be improper to remark, that the Egyp|&s;ians are of a very dark complexion, with very di&s;agree|able features; they are timid, effeminate, incapable of hard&s;hips, have a very down look, owing perhaps to their &s;ore eyes, are conceited, &s;uper&s;titious and too of|ten treacherous.</P>

<P>In &s;ome parts of the lake, the dolphins pur&s;ue the fi&s;h into little ponds, full of reeds, from whence they cannot return, becau&s;e the fi&s;hermen immediately &s;hut up the entrance into the lake with large nets. The benefits which the&s;e people reap by means of the dol|phin, induces them to look upon that fi&s;h with the ut|mo&s;t reverence; nay, &s;ome of them go &s;o far as to deem dolphins good &s;pirits, &s;ent on parpo&s;e to do them a &s;ervice; on which account, they would not de&s;troy a dolphin by any means.</P>
<P>From hence our hero pa&s;&s;ed to Damiata, which, next to Cairo, is the fine&s;t and large&s;t city in Egypt.</P>
<P>Twenty-three miles from this city is Ro&s;etta, a town of great trade, in flax, cottons, linens, rice, and leather.</P>
<P>There is-no other place of any great con&s;equence in Egypt, except Alexandria, a town of con&s;iderable trade, &s;uppo&s;ed to contain about 15,000 inhabitants.</P>
<P>We &s;hall here notice a circum&s;tance which our hero thought worthy of a memorandum.</P>
<P>On the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Nile lies a village, called Eridy, where a <HI>&s;heik</HI> of the &s;ame name re&s;ides.</P>
<P>It is famed through Egypt for a &s;nake, of which many miraculous &s;tories are related.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="027335_0113_0FD40BB41EC44050">The vulgar believe it to be the devil, bani&s;hed into the mountains of upper Egypt, by the angel <HI>Raphael,</HI> to prevent his &s;trangling young <HI>Tobias,</HI> as he had done with the &s;ix former hu&s;bands, which his bride had married.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;heik</HI> keeps this &s;erpent in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as his pre|dece&s;&s;ors for time immemorial has done. It is an inch thick, two fee 'ong, and the &s;kin is &s;mooth and red|di&s;h; it plays thou&s;and tricks, and will twine about the arms or neck of any per&s;on; without hurting them; what is remarkable, it is fonder of women than men. An annual fea&s;t is held in honour of this &s;erpent. The <HI>&s;heik</HI> pretends that he can cut it in pieces at night, and find it whole in the morning.</P>
<P>Mr. Montague looked upon this &s;erpent to be noth|ing but a tohbam, a &s;erpent common enough in Egypt; it hath more &s;agacity than the European dogs, and may be taught a great variety of tricks.</P>
<P>The land crocodile of Egypt re&s;embles the water crocodile in form, but it is &s;mall and harmle&s;s. The water crocodile, or that which is commonly under&s;tood by the name, inhabits the Nile, and is particularly fond of the lakes, formed by channels, derived from thence; they fly from tho&s;e parts which are near towns and from boats which contain many men; but will attack a &s;ingle man, or a boat with a &s;ingle man in it. This creature is to the la&s;t degree, voracious, terrible, and cruel; it is &s;ometimes thirty feet in length; it runs &s;wift, but cannot ca&s;ily turn, and iu chief &s;trength lies in its tail.</P>

<P>HAVING &s;een all that is deemed curious in E|gypt, Mr. Montague returned to Con&s;tantinople, where, finding &s;ome di&s;patches for him from his rela|tions, which appeared of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence, he determined to depart for England.</P>

by, had been dead for &s;ome years, and his mother, who had de&s;ired his pre&s;ence in England, on account of her precarious &s;tate of health, was on the verge of a di&s;&s;o|lution when he arrived.</P>
<P>She died &s;oon after, and left him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an immen&s;e fortune; indeed &s;he went &s;o far as to be ex|ceedingly partial in his &s;avour, with re&s;pect to per&s;on|als contrary to the intere&s;t of his &s;i&s;ter, the pre&s;ent Counte&s;s of Bute.</P>
<P>This occa&s;ioned a coolne&s;s between him and Lord Bute's family; and that nobleman having done him &s;ome di&s;&s;ervices, he conceived a mo&s;t implacable re|&s;entment again&s;t him, which continued till his death.</P>
<P>Though his ample fortune would have enabled him to enjoy all the luxuries of the ea&s;t, in the northern regions, where his patrimony was &s;ituated; yet a pecu|liarity of di&s;po&s;ition induced him to &s;igh for the e&s;&s;emi|nating plea&s;ures of A&s;ia. Grown fond of the ea&s;tern countries by familiarity, he determined to di&s;&s;ipate his income in the plea&s;ures which tho&s;e prolific climes afford.</P>
<P>Before his departure, he made a pre&s;ent of &s;omc cu|rious medals and other antiquities to the Royal Society; on which account, he was made a member of that learned body.</P>
<P>He &s;oon after embarked on board a merchant-&s;hip, bound for Turkey, and on his arrival at Con&s;tantinople pre&s;ented him&s;elf to the Grand Signior, by whom he was, as u&s;ually, mo&s;t cordially received.</P>
<P>He had formerly adopted the Turki&s;h habit, but now he thought proper to a&s;&s;ume the Armcnian, deem|ing it not only &s;uperior to the Turki&s;h, but to all other dre&s;&s;es in the univer&s;e.</P>

<P>MR. Montague, who&s;e di&s;po&s;itions was ever re&s;t|le&s;s, and his imagination always upon the wing, could not long remain inactive; he therefore made the tour of Per&s;ia, and &s;aw as much of that country as the di&s;tracted &s;tate of affairs would permit.</P>
<P>He perceived that the &s;oil it&s;elf was exceedingly
<PB N="119" REF="027335_0117_0FD40BBE59126560">
fruitful; but the government was &s;o arbitrary that the inhabitants could neither enjoy plenty or &s;afety.</P>
<P>There are va&s;t mountains in this country, &s;uch as Cauca&s;us, Ararat, and Taurus; but no country in the world hath &s;o few rivers.</P>
<P>The women are &s;ufficiently hand&s;ome, but they are coquetts, mad continue to heighten their beauty as much as po&s;&s;ible, by art.</P>
<P>Ispahan, the capital city of Per&s;ia, is 12 miles in cir|cumference, but the &s;trects are narrow and crooked: the chief amu&s;ement of the inhabitants is to walk upon the flat roofs of the hou&s;es, when the weather will per|mit; the hou&s;es are but of one &s;tory, and &s;ince the late troubles in Per&s;ia, not above five thou&s;and of them are inhabited.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to A&s;ia, the Per&s;ians &s;tand in the &s;ame predicament us the Fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ch do in Europe; that is, they are the models of politene&s;s, and not to imitate their manners, and under&s;tand their language, argues low breeding. Indeed their manners are the mo&s;t refined of any people in the ea&s;tem countries, and their lan|guage is the mo&s;t poetical and nervous. In &s;hort, in A&s;ia the Arabic is to be con&s;idered as the learned lan|guage, the Per&s;ian as the polite, and the Turki&s;h or the Coptic as the vulgar language.</P>
<P>The wornen are &s;o far from being re&s;erved as in mo&s;t other ea&s;tern countries, that they will not &s;cruple to make advances to tho&s;e they like. Of this our hero had a proof, while at I&s;pahan. A widow lady had ta|ken particular notice of him, and not being able to bri|dle her pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he &s;ent him a billet doux, written from the right hand to the left, (for the Per&s;ians, like the Hebrews, write in that manner.)</P>
<P>Mr. Montague was too much a cavalier not to dis
<PB N="120" REF="027335_0118_0FD40BBEF95A2100">
honour to the overture. The lady received him in a magnificent apartment, which was clo&s;e &s;hut; it was illuminated by a great number of wax tapers, as well as lamps filled with the mo&s;t odori&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous oil; and on a hearth of the fine&s;t marble, there was a large fire of the wood of aloes, though the weather was warm; this rendered the room &s;o hot, that our hero begged to re|move to &s;ome cooler place. To this reque&s;t the lady complied with great difficulty, for in her heart &s;he was a <HI>gaur</HI> or wor&s;hipper of fire.</P>
<P>This lady was &s;o extremely ceremonious in her am|ours, that the intrigue became trouble&s;ome to our hero, who le&s;t l&s;pahan, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ravelled to the north of Per&s;ia, to &s;ee a celebrated natural phaenomenon, near Baku. This is a combu&s;tible ground, filled with fiery and in|flammable particles being the chief &s;cene of the <HI>guebres</HI> devotion. The&s;e <HI>guebres</HI> are the prie&s;ts of the <HI>gaurs</HI> or fire wor&s;hippers. Several temples are &s;cattered about this ground, in one of which the <HI>guebres</HI> pretend to pre&s;erve the &s;acred &s;lame of the univer&s;al fire. This ri&s;es from the end of a large hollow cane &s;tuck into the ground, and filled with the pure&s;t &s;pirits.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ians certainly exceed all the manufacturers in the univer&s;e, in &s;ilk, woollen carpets, leather and mohair. They do not, however, pur&s;ue trade with that avidity which might be expected from people &s;o excellently well &s;ituated for commerce.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved, that foreigners, who are not Mahometans, pay a ducat a head for being permited to re&s;ide in the Per&s;ian territories. Though this tax &s;hould only be paid once, yet the officers take care to exact it in almo&s;t every town, alledging that they are not cer|tain it has been paid in any other place. Thus our hero was under the nece&s;&s;ity of paying the tax above fifty different times.</P>
<P>At Schims, a &s;ine open town, with beautiful invi|rous,

Mr. Montague determined to remain for &s;ome time. The country is fruitful to the la&s;t degree, and the wines the be&s;t in A&s;ia.</P>
<P>Here our hero fell in love with, or rather conceived a &s;trong inclination for a beautiful Circa&s;&s;ian lady. Not being able to obtain her for a mi&s;tre&s;s, he as u&s;ual addre&s;&s;ed her for a wife; he pretended to be an Ar|menian merchant, and lived in a very pro&s;u&s;e mannor, to captivate her by genero&s;ity. But liberality will not &s;ucceed in this country, without the addition of a very ab&s;urd piece of gallantry; that is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o evince his pa&s;&s;ion, a lover mu&s;t burn him&s;elf in &s;everal parts of his body, and in this &s;carified manner pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> before his mi&s;tre&s;fs; if &s;he accepts his love &s;he is cou&s;iderace enough to &s;end him fillets and &s;car&s;s of &s;ilk to bind up the &s;ores; but if his pa&s;&s;ion is di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">greeable to her, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> has only the pain for his recompen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e.

<P>This method of wooing was not at all agreeable to our hero; be could flatter, &s;wear, and embelli&s;h be|yond the truth, as well as any man, but a red hot iron did not fall in with his ideas of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Finding he could not obtain the lady, without &s;ome &s;uch burning proff of his pa&s;&s;ion, he determied to bave rccour&s;e to art.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of this re&s;olution, he &s;tained him&s;elf in &s;everal parts, in a manner &s;o ingenious that the mo&s;t di&s;cerning eye could not di&s;cover but that he was &s;cari|fied in a mo&s;t termble manner.</P>
<P>Having made him&s;elf apear mo&s;t dreadfully burnt, he pre&s;ented him&s;elf before his mi&s;he&s;s, who, kind &s;oul, was melted into compa&s;&s;ion at the &s;ight; the li|quid

<P>When &s;ufficient time had elap&s;ed for him to appear to be well, the marriage was concluded on as a matter of cour&s;e; for the gift of the &s;carfs implies an ab&s;olute con&s;ent. The ceremony it as follows:</P>

<P>The bridegroom leaves his hou&s;e in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>When the two troops meet, they return to the bride's hou&s;e where they have a ball.</P>

<P>Mr. Montague lived next door to a con&s;iderable merchant who u&s;ed to trade to Surat.</P>
<P>This merchant had a daughter of about &s;ixteen, who, though like others of that country, of a &s;warthy com|plexion, might be deemed a very agreeable brunette; her features were regular, her eyes full of fire and vi|vacity, and her limbs were formed with the utmo&s;t &s;ymmetry.</P>
<P>Our hero had built a little lodge upon a terrace, ex|actly oppo&s;ite to this lady's chamber window, in order to enjoy the cool breezes which came from the &s;ea bet|ter than he could do in the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Here he frequently amu&s;ed him&s;elf by playing upon the German flute, wich he did to admiration.</P>
<P>The lady who was concealed from his view by a lat|tice, one day lifted up the lattice while he was playing, when he had a full view or her, and was &s;truck with &s;omething in her features and manner, that appeared inexpre&s;&s;ibly engaging.</P>

<P>He begged to know who he had injured, as he was not &s;en&s;ible that he had given the lea&s;t offence to any per&s;on.</P>
<P>A &s;lave was then di&s;patehed to call the per&s;on who was to exhibit the charge again&s;t him, from another apartment.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time his next door neighbour, the Surat merchant appeared.</P>
<P>The my&s;tery was now explained; he pre&s;ently un|der&s;tood that the crime alledgcd again&s;t him, was mak|ing pre&s;ents, and writing to that gentleman's daughter, and having &s;een her face to face.</P>
<P>The governor informed him, that they were mo&s;t hei|nous offences; that now he had &s;een the young lady, and made her pre&s;ents, nobody el&s;e would marry her;
<PB N="127" REF="027335_0125_0FD40BCED3E9DEB0">
that therefore he mu&s;t either marry her him&s;elf, or lo&s;e both his eyes.</P>
<P>As this was the alternative, the reader may ea&s;ily con|ceive the choice, which a man of our hero's con&s;titution would naturally make. He did not he&s;itate a moment to con&s;ent to the marriage.</P>
<P>He was immediately di&s;charged; all parties were re|conciled, and the nuptials were &s;oon after &s;olemnized.</P>
<P>The marriage ceremony was the &s;ame as that among the Turks, with this addition, that the bride pre&s;ents the hu&s;band with a bearded arrow, which &s;he calls her por|tion. This pre&s;ent is meant to &s;eal the fidelity of her promi&s;e, as &s;he gives him an in&s;trument to u&s;e, either again&s;t her&s;elf, it &s;he &s;hould prove untrue, or again&s;t them who &s;hould a&s;&s;ault her virtue.</P>
<P>When as u&s;ual, he grew tired of his Arabian wife, he found more difficulty in getting rid of her than he had ever done with re&s;pect to any of the former. As a foreigner he was naturally &s;u&s;pected, and the idea of having been compelled to marry, increa&s;ed the &s;u&s;pi|cions of the Arabians.</P>
<P>He &s;oon perceived that he was bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a pri&s;oner at large, and that all his wife's relations, and even his neighbours, were &s;o many &s;pics upon him; the reflections which &s;uch a &s;ituation naturally gave ri&s;e to, were exceedingly di&s;agreeable, and being under a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of re&s;traint the time appeared extremely irk&s;ome.</P>
<P>At length an Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India &s;hip arrived in the port, his &s;pirits began to revive at the event, and he now conceived hopes of a &s;peedy deliverance, from what he deemed an ab&s;olute captivity.</P>
<P>He &s;oon let the captain under&s;tand who he was, inti|mated the nature of his con&s;ine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ent, and expre&s;&s;ed the de&s;ire he had to regain his liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="027335_0126_0FD40BD04EDF9630">The captain promi&s;ed to do him every &s;ervice that lay in his power; but the utmo&s;t precaution was nece&s;|&s;ary. On account of an Engli&s;h &s;hip being in the port, he was more clo&s;ely watched than ever.</P>
<P>The captain having taken a hou&s;e near the &s;trand, our hero repaired to it, when he was on the eve of depart|ing from Mocho. He was &s;ent on board the &s;hip in a che&s;t, with holes bored in it to give him air, and his de|parture was not even &s;u&s;pected untill the &s;hip was un|der weigh.</P>
<P>Indeed he was obliged to leave the property he had at Mocho behind him; but that he thought but tri&s;ling, when &s;et in competition with the liberty he obtained.</P>

<P>MR. Montague, ever re&s;tle&s;s in his di&s;po&s;ition, made another excur&s;ion into Egypt.</P>

as he has given an ample account of that journey in a letter to the Royal Society, we &s;hall tran&s;cribe his own words.</P>
<P>A letter from <HI>Edward Wortley Montague,</HI>E&s;q. F. R. S. to <HI>William William&s;on,</HI> M. D. F. R. S. containing an account of his journey from Cairo in E|gypt, to the written mountains in the de&s;art of Sinai, re|ceived January 3 <HI>d,</HI> and read before the Royal Society, March 13, 1776.</P>
<P>"It is with a good deal of difficulty that I have pre|vailed upon my&s;elf to write to you, for as coming now to Italy was quite unfore&s;een, and I am immediately going back to the ea&s;t, I have not my journal with me, but luckily have the famous in&s;cription. I am &s;en&s;iple every paper I &s;end to the Royal Society, expo&s;es more and more my incapacity; however, as the&s;e in&s;crip|tions are much wanted, I cannot avoid &s;ending them. I &s;hall only &s;peak to &s;ome of the points the bi&s;hop of Clogher mentions, but cannot avoid being now and then a little prolix.</P>
<P>I &s;at out from Cairo by the road known by the name of Tauricke Beni I&s;rael; after twenty-four hours trav|elling, at about three miles an hour, we pa&s;&s;ed by an opening in the mountains on our right hand, viz, the mountains Maxattec. There are two more roads, one to the northward of this, which the Mecca pilgrims go, and one to the &s;outh between the mountains, but never travelled, (as it does not lead to Saez, which is thirty hours march from Cairo,) Through this breach the children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> are &s;aid to have entered the moun|tains; and not to have taken the mo&s;t &s;outhern road, which I think mo&s;t probable; for tho&s;e valleys, to judge by what are now &s;een, could not be pa&s;&s;able for <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s chariots. This breach, the inhabitants told me, leads directly to a plain called Badeah, which, in Arabic &s;ignifies &s;omething new or extraordinary, as the beginning of every thing is new which was not be|fore known.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="027335_0128_0FD40BD42D4FABA0">At Suez I found an opportunity of going to Tor, by &s;ea, which I gladly embraced; that by going nearer the place, at which the I&s;raelites are &s;uppo&s;ed to have en|tered the gulph, and having a view from the &s;ea as well an that of the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, I might be a little better <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble to form a judgment about it; be&s;ides, I was wil|ling to have the views, bearings, and &s;oundings, which I took.</P>
<P>When we were oppo&s;ite to Badeah, it &s;eemed to me (for I was not on &s;hore) a plain capable of containing the l&s;raelites, with a &s;mall elevation in the middle of it. I &s;aw &s;omething too like ruins; the captains and pilots told me, that this was the place where the I&s;|raelites entered the &s;ea, and the ruins were tho&s;e of a convert (I &s;uppo&s;e built on the &s;pot in commemoration of the fact;) they added that there was good water there. There is here a &s;trong current, which &s;ets to the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, about &s;outh-ea&s;t; it forms by its &s;trength a whirlpool, where the &s;ailors &s;aid &s;hips were lo&s;t, if forced into it for want of wind, by a current. This pool is about &s;ix miles northward of Cape Karon|eel, and ju&s;t below this pool there is a &s;and, a flat i&s;|land at low water, which runs ea&s;t and we&s;t about three miles. This &s;and, I &s;uppo&s;e, is thrown up by the force of the curent, and the &s;ame current by the re&s;i&s;tance it meets with from this bank, being forced back into the ravity made by this excavation, forms the whirlpool. This pool it called Birque Pharoone, the pool or well of <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> and here they affirm his ho&s;t was de&s;troy|ed. I &s;hall &s;ay more of this, as I travel back by land. We came to an anchor in is fathom wather, within a mile and a half of the &s;hore, to the &s;o thward of this &s;and, and in the Birque Karondel, to the northward of the cape; here the ea&s;tern &s;hore is already mountain|ous, which near this place is a &s;andy beach. The E|gyptian &s;hore from Suez to Badeah is likewi&s;e rocky and &s;teep, &s;o that there is no entering upon the gulph from that &s;hore, but at Bddeah or Suez.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="027335_0129_0FD40BD671082B78">It is high water always when the moon is at her mo|ridian height, and it ebbs &s;ix hours. At Suez it flows &s;ix feet, the &s;pring tidies are nine, and in the variable months, from the beginning of November to the end of April, &s;ometimes twelve. From the beginning of May to the beginning of October a northerly wind gen|erally ri&s;es, and goes down with the &s;un; it is often very &s;trong. This wind never fails in the&s;e months, unle&s;s there be &s;ome violent &s;torm. The re&s;t of the year the winds are variable, and when they blow hard at S. and S. S. E. the&s;e winds &s;et up the &s;ea through the narrow &s;treight of Babel Mandel, and up this gulph through its mouth, between C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bel at Zait on the we&s;t &s;ide of this &s;ea, and the &s;outhernmo&s;t point of the bay of Tor, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of this we&s;tern branch of this &s;ea, where it is not above twelve or fourteen miles over. I &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a wind hindering the water from going out, cau&s;es this extraordinary increa&s;e in the &s;pring tides. The &s;ame thing happens with the &s;ame winds at Venice, both gulphi running nearly in the &s;ame direction.</P>
<P>The Egyptian, we&s;term, or Thebaic &s;hore, from Ba|deah &s;outhward to oppo&s;ite Tor, on the ea&s;tern &s;hore, is all mountainous and &s;teep, and at Elim, the north|ernmo&s;t point of the bay of Tor, ends the ridge of mountains, which begin on the ea&s;tern &s;hore of this we&s;tern branch at Karondel. I &s;ay nothing of Elim or Tor, or the marine productions of this gulph, as this paper is intended to give an account of Sharme, Meenah el Dazhab Kade&s;h Barnea, the &s;tone which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;trucle twice, and the in&s;criptions; I however mu&s;t &s;ay, that from this place Mount Sinai, properly &s;o called, cannot be &s;een, but only the ridge or groupe of mountains in which it is, and which altogether form that part of this tongue of land, called in general Mount Sinai, The garden of the monks of Mount Sinai at Elim, renders in dates, &amp;c. 20,000 pia&s;tres per annum, or 2,500 pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="027335_0130_0FD40BD8400226C8">We from thence cro&s;&s;ed the plain in about eight hours, and entered the mountains of Sinai; they are of granite of different colours. At the entrance of the narrow breach through which we pa&s;&s;ed; I &s;aw on a large loo&s;e granite &s;tone, an in&s;cription in unknown characters, given, I think, by Doctor <HI>Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ock,</HI> bi&s;hop of O&s;&s;ory. However as the I&s;raelites had no writing that we know of, when they pa&s;&s;ed here, I did not think it of con&s;equence enough to &s;top for. The Arabs told me it was relative to a battle fought here between A|rabs, and indeed I did not &s;ee what points of hi&s;tory it can illu&s;trate, be&s;ides, there are not above five or &s;ix words. We arrived at the convent of Mount Sinai, after the u&s;ual difficulties mentioned by other travellers, were received as u&s;ual, and &s;aw the u&s;ual places. I mu&s;t &s;ay that the monks were far from owning to me, that they had ever meddled with the print of the foot of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s camel. I examined it narrowly, and no chi&s;&s;el has ab&s;olutely ever touched it; for the coat of the granite is intire, and unbroke in every part; and every body knows, that if the coat of le&s;s hard &s;tones than granite is once de&s;troyed, it never returns. It is a mo&s;t curious <HI>lu&s;us natura,</HI> and the Mahometans turn it to their u&s;e.</P>
<P>Meribah is, indeed &s;urprizingly &s;triking; I examined the lips of its mouth, and found that no chi&s;&s;el had ever worked there. The channel is plainly worn by only the cour&s;e of water, and the bare in&s;pection of it is &s;uffi|cient to convince any one it is not the work of a man; among&s;t the innumerable cracks in rocks, which I have &s;een in this as well as other parts of the world, I never met with any like this, except that at Jeru&s;alem, and the two which are in the rock which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;truck twice, of which hereafter.</P>
<P>I had enquired of the captain and the two pilots of our &s;hip, about Sharme and Dzahab, on the we&s;tern &s;hore of the ea&s;tern branch of the Red Sea; they told me that they were often forced up the Elanitic gulf, the ea&s;tern branch of the Red Sea, and generally went to
<PB N="133" REF="027335_0131_0FD40BD972A9CD88">
Sharme, and &s;ometimes as high as Dzahab. That they generally ran from Cape Mahomet, the &s;outhermo&s;t part of the penin&s;ula, between tho&s;e two gulfs to &s;harme in fix hours; becau&s;e they made as much more way as they commonly do, they very &s;eldom going there but in a &s;torm. They generally run four knots, &s;o that makes 48 miles, which brings it to the northward of Tor. Tor is in latitude 27 deg 55 min. Cape Mahomet 30 &s;outhward, latitude 27 deg. 25 min. Sharme 48 miles, nearly north latitude 23 deg. 13 min. con&s;equently about north-ea&s;t of Sinai. The port is pretty large, &s;urround|ed by mountains, the entrance very narrow, and the wa|ter deep quite to the rocks, which are &s;o very &s;teep that a &s;tone dropped from the &s;ummit falls into the ba&s;on. No wind can be felt here; they do not ca&s;t anchor, but fa&s;ten their cables to the rocks. There is good water; &s;ome habitations are found on the &s;ides of the moun|tains, and a pretty large village at top. This &s;eems to an&s;wer the idea of <HI>Ne&s;t-Ken.</HI></P>
<P>Dzahab lies as high again up the gulf, &s;o 48 miles more, or in lat. 29 deg. This port is con&s;iderably lar|ger than the former, and very good, but not &s;o clo&s;ely &s;urrounded with mountains; it is however &s;afe. There is a well of great antiquity, with very good water; very con&s;iderable ruins are found, and they &s;ay there was a great city formerly, but no inhabitants now, except an Arabian camp of 2000 men. There is a road from it to Jeru&s;alem, formerly much frequented. Thus far the captain and pilots. I enquired from the Monks as well as Arabs, about the&s;e places, as well as about the ruins, &s;uppo&s;ed by my learned friend the bi&s;hiop of O&s;&s;ory, to be Kade&s;h Barnea. The former could only tell me, they had not received any fi&s;h from thence many years; that it was two ea&s;y days journey off, but the road was mountainous; &s;o one may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uppo&s;e the di&s;tance le&s;s than 40 miles. The Arabs agreed as to the road, but they &s;aid it was once a large place, where their prince lived, who&s;e daughter <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> married; that <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> was after|wards their prince, and the greate&s;t of all prophets.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="027335_0132_0FD40BDAD9AED828">The&s;e Arabs place <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> the fir&s;t, <HI>Solomon</HI> the &s;e|cond, <HI>Mahomet</HI> the third, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> the fourth, and then the prophets of the bible. As to Dzahab the monks only knew the di&s;tance to be four days journey, and that there was a rond from it to Jeru&s;alem; (the Arabs told me the &s;ame) &s;o the di&s;tance is about 80 miles, I enquired of them all about the ruins. They told me there were confiderable ones about half way to Dzahab, about 40 miles from Sinai; but I &s;hould think Kade&s;h mu&s;t have been much nearer to Jeru&s;alem. I would willingly have gone to the&s;e places, but as the four clans of Arabs, which inhabit this promontory, were then at war with the other, I could get no conductor. In any other journey I hope to be more lucky, or this is all hear&s;ay; however, combining the whole together, and comparing it with what we collect from &s;cripture, I think we may conclude Sharme to be Midian, and Mee|nah el Dzahab to be Eziongeber; what the interjacent ruins are, I cannot, conjecture; but I believe have found Kade&s;h Barnea to be el&s;ewhere; I think it cannot be here, for the I&s;raelites were on the borders of the holy land, or land of promi&s;e, when they were ordered back, and when they were &s;topped by the Moabites. They are &s;aid to have been brought up from Kade&s;h Barnea, and I meet with no place in &s;acred writing, or any an|cient geographer, neither <HI>Strabo</HI> nor any other, that draw the line between this promontory and the land of promi&s;e &s;o low down; nor could they do it, as the&s;e ruins are within almo&s;t 70 miles of the extremity of it.</P>
<P>There and two roads from mount Sinai to Jeru&s;alem, the one through Pharan, the other by the way of Dza|hab. That through Pharan, is eleven days journey, two to Phatah, three to a &s;tation of the Mecca pilgrims, cal|led Shei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h Ali, and one and a half to &s;ome con&s;iderable ruins; all this northward. From thence four and &s;ome|thing moral to Jeru&s;alem, by the way of Hebron, leav|ing the A&s;phal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ic lake on the night hand, to the, &s;outh-|ea&s;t: The other way is longer, on account of the road being more mountainous; that too pa&s;&s;es the &s;ame ru|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, and al&s;o Seheich Ali.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="027335_0133_0FD40BDC5807DB00">I enquired about this when I was at Jeru&s;alem, and received the very &s;ame account with this addition, that &s;uch Mahometans as went from Jeru&s;alem to Mecca, went that way to join the Cairo car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> at S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heich Ali. This &s;eems to be a &s;ituation oppo&s;ite Kade&s;h Barnea, as the line drawn by all the geographers; it is without mount Sinai, (taken for this whole tract) and ju&s;t before the Moabites, as the children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> pa&s;&s;ed by mount Hor, now Acaba, leaving the A&s;phaltic lake on their left hand to the north-we&s;t. The tradition too of the Arabs is, that they pa&s;&s;ed this way; therefore I think Kade&s;h Barnea mu&s;t be near this &s;pot. There are here con&s;iderable ruins, and I know of no city that ever was here, for Petra lay more to the ea&s;t, A&s;phaltic lake and and the Elanitic gulf. To leave no enquiry wanting, I a&s;ked the rabbins of Jeru&s;alem where they placed Ka|de&s;h Barnea, and they &s;aid the&s;e ruins.</P>
<P>We &s;et out from mount Sinai by the way of Scheich Salem, and after we had pa&s;&s;ed <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s &s;tone, came to the beautiful valley mentioned in the journal. I lay there, and did not &s;et out before day light, that I might not pa&s;s the rock which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;truck twice; I &s;earched and enquired of my Arabs, but could neither hear nor &s;ee any thing of it. I &s;aw &s;everal &s;hort in&s;criptions &s;tained on &s;ome parts of the mountains; the characters being the &s;ame as tho&s;e on mount Sinai, Meribah, &amp;c. given by the bi&s;hop of O&s;&s;ory. About four miles before we arrived at Pharan, we pa&s;&s;ed through a remarkable breach in a rock, each &s;ide of it is perpendicular as a wall, about 80 feet high, and the breach is about 40 broad. It is at this breach I imagine, the Horites were &s;mote, four miles beyond the pre&s;ent ruins of Pharan, for having pa&s;&s;ed this breach, they could make a &s;tand, nor could they be pur&s;ued. Here on the tops of the mountains, to our right hand, were ruins of buildings, and one &s;eemed a ca&s;tle. From Meribah to near this place we had always rather d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ended.</P>

breach, it winded off towards the we&s;t; for the waters fall into that part of the de&s;art, we cro&s;&s;ed from Tor. Between thin breach and Pharan there are &s;everal &s;prings and one at Pharan, where we encamped. There is the bed of the river mentioned by the journal; the tradi|tional account of which agrees with what is &s;aid by St. <HI>Paul.</HI> Waters &s;eem to have run from Meribah, to within about &s;ix miles of this place; the bed of a &s;tream is here again very plain, and a &s;pring at the upper end of it, which does not yield water enough to make a &s;tream, the bed then is dry; four vallies terminate here, and form a large area. I enquired about the road to Je|ru&s;alem; the people agreed in the di&s;tance and ruins.</P>
<P>We travelled in the bed of the river through the val|ley, to the north, and in about half an hour the &s;ight and appearance of a large &s;tone, not unlike Meribah, which lay at &s;ome di&s;tance from the mountain on our right hand which &s;truck me; and I al&s;o observed, it had ina|ny &s;mall &s;tones upon it. The Arabs, where they have any &s;tone or &s;pot in veneration, as <HI>Makowict</HI>'s &s;tone and the like, after their devotion, lay &s;ome &s;mooth &s;tone upon it. I a&s;ked what it was, they told me <HI>hagar Mou&s;a,</HI> the &s;tone of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> I told them that could not be, for that lay in Rephidim; they &s;aid that was true, but this was <HI>hagar il ck<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ain,</HI> the &s;tone of the two &s;trokes; that he &s;truck it twice, and more water came from it than from Meribah, witne&s;s the river.

<P>We went down a large valley to the we&s;t, towards the &s;ea, and pa&s;&s;ed the head of a valley, a part of the de&s;art of Sin, which &s;eparates the mountains of Pharan from tho&s;e which run along the coa&s;t, and the &s;ame plain which we had pa&s;&s;ed from Tor. We had &s;carce entered the&s;e mountains and travelled an hoar, when af|ter pa&s;&s;ing a mountain, where there were vi&s;ible marks of an extingui&s;hed &s;ubterranean fire, we &s;aw on our left hand a &s;mall rock with &s;ome unknown characters cut on it, not &s;tained upon it, as tho&s;e hitherto met with, and in ten minutes we entered a valley, &s;ix miles broad, running nearly north and &s;outh, with all the rocks which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nclo&s;e it on the we&s;t &s;ide covered with characters.

They cannot have been written by I&s;|raelites, or Mahometans, for the above rea&s;on, and if by Mahometans they would have &s;ome re&s;emblance to &s;ome &s;ort of C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">phic characters which w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re the characters u&s;|ed in the Arabic language before the in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the pre&s;ent Arabic letters.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="027335_0136_0FD3D079514441F0">The fir&s;t M. S. S. of the Alcoran were in Cuphic. There is a fine one at Cairo, which I could not pur|cha&s;e, as it is in the principal mo&s;que, and the <HI>iman</HI> would not &s;teal it for me under 400 &s;equins, 200 pounds. The&s;e have not the lea&s;t re&s;emblance of them. Saracen characters are very unlike; I think it not im|probable that they were written in the fir&s;t ages of Chri&s;|tianity, when pilgrimages from Jeru&s;alem to Mount Sinai were fa&s;hionable, con&s;equently frequent and nu|merous, by the new Chri&s;tian Jews who believed in <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Therefore I &s;hould believe them Hebrew cha|racters, u&s;ed vulgarly by the Jews, about the time of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> I &s;hewed them at Jeru&s;lem to the rabbins; they were of the &s;ame opinion. It &s;eems much ea&s;ier to &s;ay what the in&s;criptions are not, than what they are. They can &s;carce be of St. <HI>Helen</HI>'s time, for they would have &s;ome analogy with Greek characters, and they have none. Perhaps &s;ome gentlemen think them ancient E|gyptian, written by the colony, which, they &s;uppo&s;e, went to inhabit China; but &s;uch colony, if ever there was &s;uch a one, probably went the &s;trait road, from the head of one gulf, to the head of the other, from Hiero|polis to Eloth, the way the Mecca pilgrims now go. This place would have been far out of their way, being at lea&s;t. &s;ixty miles to the &s;outh of the pilgrims' road, unle&s;s they were &s;uppo&s;ed to have had tran&s;ports at Dza|hab or Sharme. Here are on other parts of this rock, &s;ome Greek and Arabic, as well as Saracen in&s;criptions, and an Hebrew one. The Saracens and Arabic only &s;ay, "Such an one was here at &s;uch a time." The &s;ame &s;ay the Greek ones, except one, which &s;ays, as I remember, for I have it not with me, <Q>The evil geni|us of the army wrote this,</Q> which can only prove that &s;ome body of the Greeks were wor&s;ted here.</P>
<P>The third day from this place, travelling we&s;tward, we encamped at Sarondon, as the journal calls it, but it is Karondel, where are the bitter waters Marah. I tri|ed if the branches of any of the trees had any effect on the water, but found none; &s;o the effect mentioned in
<PB N="139" REF="027335_0137_0FD40BE49E9EA368">
&s;cripture mu&s;t have been miraculous. The&s;e waters at the &s;pring, are &s;omewhat bitter and bracki&s;h; but on every foot run over, the &s;and is covered with bituminous &s;alts, grown up by the exce&s;&s;ive heat of the &s;un; they acquire much &s;altne&s;s and bitterne&s;s, and very &s;oon be|come not potable.

<P>After nine hours and a half march we arived and en|camped at the de&s;art of Shur or Sour. The con&s;tant tradition is, that the I&s;raelites afcended from the &s;ea here; this is oppo&s;ite to the plain Badeah, to which the above-mentioned pa&s;s in the mountains leads. From this place the openings in the mountain appear a great crack, and may be called a mouth, taking Hiroth for an apellative: however, I &s;hould rather adopt the &s;ignifi|cation of liberty. It could hardly have been nece&s;&s;ary for the I&s;raelites to pa&s;s the &s;ea, if they were within two or three miles of the northern extremity of the gulf. The &s;pace of, at mo&s;t, two miles, the brea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th of the gulf at Suez, and at mo&s;t, three feet deep, at low water, for it is then con&s;tantly waded over, could not have con|tained &s;o many people of drowned <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s army. There would have been little nece&s;&s;ity for his cavalry and chariots to precipitate them&s;elves after a number of people, on foot, incumbered with their wives, children, and baggage, when they could &s;oon have overtaken them by going &s;o little about. The&s;e rea&s;ons, added to the &s;ignificant names of the places, Tauriche Ben I&s;rael, road of the children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> Attacah, deliverance, Phahi|roth, whether an appellative or &s;ignative, Budeah, new thing or miracle, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aohorel Poloum, &s;ea of de&s;truction, convince me that the I&s;raelites entered the &s;ea at Bade|ah, and no where el&s;e.

But the name de|&s;cended to the whole, as their knowledge of it. The Red Sea &s;eems to regard the broad part alone. For though there are not the above &s;ea production, yet there is &s;o great a quantity of the tube coral (not found in the we&s;tern part of the Hierapolitic gulf) and &s;uch rocks, as one may &s;ay of them, that the Gidda &s;hips fa&s;ten them|&s;elves to them in&s;tead of ca&s;ting anchor.

<P>AFTER this excur&s;ion to the written mountains, we find that Mr. Montague revi&s;ited Italy: &s;ince the ingenious Mr. <HI>Samuel Sharp,</HI> in his letters from Italy, in the year 1767, makes the following mention of him.</P>
<P><Q>One of the mo&s;t curious &s;ights among&s;t the curio&s;i|ties at Venice, was the famous Mr. Montague. He was ju&s;t arrived from the ca&s;t, he had travelled
<PB N="142" REF="027335_0140_0FD40BE9DDAC5040">
through the Holy Land, Egypt, Armenia, &amp;c. with the Old and New Te&s;tament in his hands, he had vi&s;ited Mount Sinai, and flattered him&s;elf he had been on the very part of the rock where <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;pake face to face with God Almighty: his beard reached down to his brea&s;t, and the dre&s;s of his head was Ar|menian. He was in the mo&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;tick raptures with Arabia and the Arabs: his bed was the ground, his food rice, his beverage water, his luxury a pipe and coffee.</Q></P>
<P>This ab&s;temious method of living in imitation of the Arabs and Armenians, our hero adopted in the latter part: of his life, for he had formerly indulged him&s;elf in all the luxuries and &s;en&s;ualities of the ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Having rather blunted the edge of his curio&s;ity hy continual travel, he re&s;ided &s;everal years at Con&s;tantino|ple. With re&s;pect to eating and drinking he affected great temperance, but he was never without a &s;eraglio filled with the beauties of Georgia, Circa&s;&s;ia, and Greece; as he deemed a plurality of women con&s;onant to the cu&s;|toms of the patriarchal ages of which he was &s;o fond.</P>
<P>At length growing very infirm, he began to fear an approaching di&s;&s;olution; this determined him once more to revi&s;it England, in order to &s;ettle his temporal con|cerns. He reflected with con&s;iderable chagrin, that his &s;i&s;ter, the wife of the pre&s;ent Earl of Bute was his heir at law. For his enmity to that nobleman and his family continued, or rather, had im realed with his years, and he &s;eemed to have gath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d additional malignity by time.</P>
<P>By his &s;everal wives and con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ubines he had &s;everal children, but was &s;en&s;ible that they could lay no legal claim to his e&s;tate after his demi&s;e, on account of his pri|or marriage with the pretty wa&s;her wom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, who had ne|ver been pregnant by him.</P>
<P>But a letter he received from England gave him new
<PB N="143" REF="027335_0141_0FD40BEB5261D750">
&s;pirits, for it informed him of the death of the wa&s;her|woman, his fir&s;t wife, who had, till this, lived in the country upon her annuity, in a very i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;en&s;ive and reti|red manner.</P>
<P>On the receipt of this intelligence, a thought &s;truck his imagination, which gave him a &s;en&s;ible &s;atisfaction, as it pre&s;ented him with the idea of throwing his e&s;tate into another channel, and di&s;appointing tho&s;e obnoxious relations who were in &s;anguine expectation of its falling to them.</P>
<P>His &s;cheme was to marry &s;ome young woman of indi|gent circum&s;tances, who was pregnant that the child be|ing born in wedlock, might become his heir. For he was too &s;en&s;ible of his own imbecillity from age and infirmities to &s;uppo&s;e he &s;hould ever have a child of his own.</P>
<P>Warm with the idea of this novel method of &s;hewing the mo&s;t permanent re&s;entment to tho&s;e he &s;o much di&s;|reli&s;hed, he wrote to a friend in England to procure a proper young woman in a &s;tate of pregnancy, with all po&s;&s;ible expedition.</P>
<P>This reque&s;t to his friends occa&s;ioned an adverti&s;ement to be in&s;erted in the morning papers.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this adverti&s;ement &s;everal unfortu|nate fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ones applied, who had been more prolific than their circum&s;tances rendered convenient, and having been for&s;aken by their faithle&s;s &s;wains, thought by the tenor of the adverti&s;ement that it was a favorable oppor|tunity to alleviate their misfortunes.</P>
<P>Four of the&s;e were &s;elected for our hero's choice. The fir&s;t being in the third; the &s;econd in the fourth; the third in the fifth; and the fourth in the &s;ixth month of her pregnancy.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="027335_0142_0FD40BED2B6EE198">They were informed that the per&s;on who&s;e happine&s;s it &s;hould be to be cho&s;en by Mr. Montague, would have a genteel &s;ettlement for life; be&s;ides the child of which &s;he was pregnant becoming by the marriage heir to a con|&s;iderable e&s;tate; and that the three who&s;e fortune it was to be rejected, would have a pre&s;ent of 200 pounds each. Perfectly &s;atisfied with this, they were &s;ent to France, in in order to proceed to Paris, where Mr. Montague was to meet them, that the hymeneal election might be made with all po&s;&s;ible expedition; but the ladies were all di&s;|appointed, as Mr. Montague did not reach Paris, being &s;eized at Venice with a malignant fever, which carried him off in a few days. Thus his relations who were &s;o obnoxious to him, were much more befriended by for|tune, than by his age or impotency.</P>
