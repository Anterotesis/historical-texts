<HEAD>THE MODERN QUAKER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>A comparative view of the</HI> PRIMITIVE <HI>and</HI> PRESENT <HI>&s;tate of the Society of</HI> FRIENDS, <HI>particularly addre&s;&s;ed to the Youth. Written in</HI> ENGLAND <HI>by an Ob&s;erver, and pre&s;ented to</HI> FRIENDS' <HI>Children.</HI></P>
<L>THY daughters, Fox, in former days</L>
<L>When they de&s;erv'd, contemn'd all prai&s;e,</L>
<L>But, with a &s;elf-approving mind,</L>
<L>No charms in human prai&s;e they find;</L>
<L>Yet let my mu&s;e their virtues trace,</L>
<L>And dwell with joy on ev'ry grace:</L>
<L>The lovely portrait hung on high,</L>
<L>Perhap's may &s;trike &s;ome fair one's eye;</L>
<L>Its charms &s;hall touch the <HI>modern</HI> dame,</L>
<L>And flu&s;h her cheek with con&s;cious &s;hame.</L>
<L>No co&s;tly robes, no broider'd hair,</L>
<L>No &s;ilks adorn'd the mode&s;t fair:</L>
<L>Di&s;tended hoops would &s;hock the eye&mdash;</L>
<L>A naked brea&s;t would terrify!</L>
<L>They held that wanton, gay attire,</L>
<L>Was fuel for la&s;civious fire,</L>
<L>And valu'd more St. Paul's advice,</L>
<L>Which bade them &s;eek the <HI>pearl of price.</HI></L>
<L>And why &s;hould dre&s;s, our parent's &s;hame,</L>
<L>Their daughters brea&s;ts with pride inflame?</L>
<L>But tho' in &s;imple robes array'd,</L>
<L>Behold what beauties grace the maid.</L>
<L>Upon her lip &s;its &s;acred truth,</L>
<L>Temp'rance gives the bloom of youth;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="046509_0002_10217A3FB4399930">
Within her brea&s;t dwells tranquil peace,</L>
<L>With mode&s;t blu&s;hes in her face;</L>
<L>Love &s;parkles in her dove-like eyes,</L>
<L>For innocence needs no di&s;gui&s;e,</L>
<L>But prudence, on her brow enthron'd,</L>
<L>Commands re&s;pect from all around.</L>
<L>Fair Cha&s;tity her &s;oul in&s;pires,</L>
<L>And Charity's immortal fires;</L>
<L>Virtue within her &s;potle&s;s mind</L>
<L>Sits like a DEITY en&s;hrin'd.</L>
<L>No vain romance, or wanton play,</L>
<L>Could wa&s;te a moment of the day,</L>
<L>But oft with deep, attentive thought,</L>
<L>They read the book with wi&s;dom fraught.</L>
<L>They could employ their vacant hours,</L>
<L>Extracting health from herbs and flowers,</L>
<L>Which freely on the waters ca&s;t,</L>
<L>They doubt not will return at la&s;t.</L>
<L>But &s;ee them now in crowds repair,</L>
<L>To dwell within the hou&s;e of pray'r.</L>
<L>Here no cold forms, no &s;lavi&s;h rules,</L>
<L>(So oft the &s;acrifice of fools)</L>
<L>Confine the &s;park of heavenly flame,</L>
<L>That would a&s;cend from whence it came.</L>
<L>Now every human care re&s;ign'd,</L>
<L>Deep &s;ilence fills th' adoring mind;</L>
<L>Patient they wait th' in&s;piring breath,</L>
<L>Which bade them ri&s;e from life to death;</L>
<L>That flame cele&s;tial, which in&s;pires</L>
<L>The ardent &s;oul with &s;trong de&s;ires.</L>
<L>But vain my efforts to de&s;cribe</L>
<L>The virtues of this cho&s;en tribe:</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="046509_0003_10217A42B4D25E90">
In their de&s;cendants can we trace</L>
<L>Such virtues, &s;anctity and grace?</L>
<L>Ye fair apo&s;tates! who &s;o long</L>
<L>Have learn'd the Babyloni&s;h &s;ong,</L>
<L>When e'er you turn the &s;acred page,</L>
<L>Let Dinah's fate your thoughts engage;</L>
<L>None did a&s;&s;ault the &s;potle&s;s maid,</L>
<L>Whil&s;t in the Patriarch's tent &s;he &s;taid,</L>
<L>But when &s;he quits the &s;acred fence,</L>
<L>She lo&s;es fame and innocence:</L>
<L>So you, while by &s;age rules confin'd,</L>
<L>Rules which by wi&s;dom were de&s;ign'd,</L>
<L>You &s;hine as &s;tars, with heavenly fire,</L>
<L>E'en I, a Gentile, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author did not belong to the profe&s;&s;ion of Friends.</NOTE>mu&s;t admire;</L>
<L>But when beyond the&s;e bounds you &s;tray,</L>
<L>Temptations thick lie in the way:</L>
<L>Beware, fair Nymphs! on gla&s;s you &s;tand,</L>
<L>And Hamor's &s;ons are near at hand.</L>
<L>Why is the bo&s;om open laid&mdash;</L>
<L>Or veil'd beneath a cob-web &s;hade?</L>
<L>Why doth the wanton eye impart</L>
<L>Its fire into another's heart?</L>
<L>Are hoops, ye fair back&s;liders! &s;ay,</L>
<L>Fit for the <HI>broad</HI> or <HI>narrow</HI> way?</L>
<L>Will a fair face, or graceful mien</L>
<L>Keep &s;ickne&s;s off, or bani&s;h pain?</L>
<L>Will time's relentle&s;s weapon &s;pare</L>
<L>The faultle&s;s &s;hape, or braided hair?</L>
<L>In vain, my &s;i&s;ters, you conceal</L>
<L>What every motion mu&s;t reveal;</L>

Oh pardon then the friendly care,</L>
<L>That &s;ays you are not what you were.</L>
<L>Six days I pa&s;s, nor will I a&s;k</L>
<L>How you in them perform'd your ta&s;k;</L>
<L>But let your friend a tale relate,</L>
<L>In&s;truction may in trifles wait.</L>
<L>Chance lately led my wandering feet</L>
<L>Where all the friendly circle meet;</L>
<L>There no proud columns lifted high,</L>
<L>Nor &s;culptur'd dome attract the eye;</L>
<L>Fair decency, with &s;olemn grace,</L>

<L>At Ramah Saul forgets his pride,</L>
<L>And lays his &s;avage rage a&s;ide.</L>
<L>I enter'd&mdash;and with great &s;urprize</L>
<L>Around I ca&s;t my wond'ring eyes!</L>
<L>"What can this mean!&mdash;each blooming maid</L>
<L>"In rich and gaudy robes array'd?</L>
<L>"What rainbow dies! what changing hue!</L>
<L>"What forms deck'd out in public view!"</L>
<L>The hair in graceful arches ro&s;e,</L>
<L>The &s;weeping train as graceful flows;</L>
<L>No lavi&s;h ornament's deny'd,</L>
<L>Can Sion's daughter's &s;toop to pride?</L>
<L>Where is the &s;weetly timmid air,</L>

<L>I find them not; but in their &s;tead</L>

<L>By your degenerate race di&s;dain'd.</L>

<L>Many have fall'n, but yet not all,</L>
