<P><HI>Friday, October</HI> 31. Met with a bitter Pamph|let wrote again&s;t me by &s;ome of the Presbyterian Per&s;ua&s;ion, and found Freedom given me to an&s;wer it. I long &s;ince expected clo&s;e Oppo&s;ition from that Quarter. I believe it will be increa&s;ing daily. The Lord will make me more than Conqueror thro' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Love <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Met al&s;o with two Volumes of Sermons published in <HI>London</HI> as delivered by me, tho' I never preached on mo&s;t of the Texts. But <HI>Satan</HI> mu&s;t try all Ways to bring the Work of God into Contempt. Ble&s;&s;ed be God, who enables me abundantly to rejoice in all Things that befal me.
<PB N="5" REF="004851_0004_100E01FE4D1B6478">Preached in the Morning at Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI>'s Meeting Hou&s;e: But never &s;aw the Word of God fall with &s;uch Weight in <HI>New-York</HI> before. Two or three cri|ed out. <HI>Mr. Noble</HI> could &s;carce refrain him&s;elf. And, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> where I would, many &s;eem'd deeply wounded. At Night the Word was attended with great Power. One cried out; and the Lord enabled me, at the latter End of my Sermon, to &s;peak with Authority. Alas! How vain are the Thoughts of Men! As I came along Ye&s;terday, I found my Heart &s;omewhat dejected, and told Mr. <HI>Noble</HI> I expected but little Movings in <HI>New-York;</HI> but Mr. <HI>Noble</HI> bid me "expect great Things from God," and likewi&s;e told me of &s;everal who were, as he hoped, &s;avingly wrought upon by my Mini&s;try, when there la&s;t. <HI>O Lord, let the&s;e Things humble my Soul for thy own Name's Sake.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, November</HI> 1. Fini&s;hed my An&s;wer to the Pamphlet. God enabled me to write it in the Spirit of Meekne&s;s. <HI>O Lord, give it thy Ble&s;&s;ing!</HI> Preached twice as Ye&s;terday to very crowded Audi|tories, and neither Time without Power. In the Evening Exerci&s;e, &s;ome fainted, and the Lord &s;eem|ed to &s;hew us more and more, that a Time for favour|ing <HI>New-York</HI> was near at Hand. <HI>O wherefore did I doubt!

<P><HI>Sunday, November</HI> 2. Preached this Morning with Freedom and &s;ome Power, but was much dejected before the Evening Sermon. For near half an Hour before I left Mr. <HI>Noble</HI>'s Hou&s;e, I could only lie before the Lord and &s;ay, <Q>I was a poor Sinner, and wonder that Chri&s;t would be gracious to &s;uch a Wretch</Q> As I went to Meeting, I grew weak|er and weaker, and when I came into the Pulpit, I
<PB N="6" REF="004851_0005_100E020115D07130">could have cho&s;e to be &s;ilent rather than &s;peak. But, after I had begun, the Spirit of the Lord gave me Freedom, till at length it came down like a mighty Ru&s;hing Wind, and carried all before it. Immedi|ately the whole Congregation was alarmed. Shriek|ing, Crying, Weeping and Wailing were to be heard in every Corner. Men's Hearts failing them for Fear, and many falling into the Arms of their Friends. My Soul was carried out till I could &s;carce &s;peak any more. A Sen&s;e of God's Goodne&s;s overwhelmed me. As I went down, a Woman &s;aid, <Q>Come and s;ee what God has done for me To-night.</Q> I look|ed, and her Daughter, in a great Agony, was cry|ing out, "Oh my Je&s;us, my Je&s;us!" Another, a little Boy, was &s;o concerned on the Pulpit Stairs, that he could &s;carce &s;tand. One of my Friends a&s;ked him why he cried, <Q>Who can help it? &s;aid he. Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Words cut me to the Heart.</Q> After I came home, I threw my&s;elf upon the Bed, and in an awful Silence, admired the infinite Freene&s;s, So|vereignty and Conde&s;cen&s;ion of the Love of God. I was unwilling to move, but was called down to the Marriage of Mr. <HI>B&mdash;r,</HI> whom I met at <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> who being e&s;pou&s;ed to the young Woman, was &s;o &s;truck at the &s;ame Place, by my Advice, who married her this Night, and both are going as my A&s;&s;i&s;tants to <HI>Georgia.</HI> Never did I &s;ee a more &s;olemn Wedding. Je&s;us Chri&s;t was called, and he was pre&s;ent in a remarkable Manner. After Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> had married them, I prayed. But my Soul, how was it enabled to wre&s;tle with and lay hold on God! I was in a very great Agony, and the Holy Gho&s;t was remarkably pre&s;ent, that mo&s;t, I believe, could &s;ay, <HI>Surely God is in this Place!</HI> After this, Divine
<PB N="7" REF="004851_0006_100E020387EB9A68">Manife&s;tations flowed in &s;o fa&s;t, that my frail Ta|bernacle was &s;carce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to &s;u&s;tain them. My dear Friends &s;at round <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> on the Bed-&s;ides. I prayed for each of them alternately with &s;trong Cries, and pier|ced by the Eye of Faith, even within the Veil. I continued in this Condition for about half an Hour, a&s;tonished at my own Vilene&s;s, and the Excellency of Chri&s;t, then ro&s;e full of Peace, &amp; Love &amp; Joy. O how am I obliged to my Enemies? God has remark|ably revealed him&s;elf to my Soul, ever &s;ince I have &s;een the Pamphlet published by the Presbyterians again&s;t me. O how faithful is he that hath promi|&s;ed, <HI>It &s;hall brui&s;e thy Heel, and thou &s;halt brui&s;e his Head; Lord enable me to lay hold on this, during the Time of my &s;ojourning here on Earth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, Nov.</HI> 3. Preached both Morning and Afternoon, and perceived the Congregations &s;till in|crea&s;e. There was a great and gracious Melting among&s;t the People both Times, but no crying out. Near 110 <HI>l.</HI> Currency were collected for the Or|phans; and in the Evening many came and took an affectionate Leave. About &s;even we took Boat; reached <HI>Staten I&s;land</HI> about ten, greatly refre&s;hed in my inner Man. A dear Chri&s;tian Friend received us gladly. We &s;olaced our&s;elves by &s;inging and praying. And about Midnight retired to &s;leep, &s;till longing for that Time when I &s;hould &s;leep no more. <HI>Lord keep me from a &s;inful and 100 cager De&s;ire after Death. I de&s;ire not to be impatient. I de&s;ire quietly to wait till my ble&s;s;ed Change come. Amen and Amen.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Tuesday, November</HI> 4. Preached from a Waggon on <HI>Staten I&s;land,</HI> to about 3 or 400 People. The

Many others wept al&s;o, and &s;everal of God's Children felt the Pre&s;ence of the dear Lord Je&s;us in their Hearts. Many of them rejoiced to &s;ee me again. One gray-headed Man came and told me how God had brought him from Darkne&s;s to Light, when I was here la&s;t.

It being the la&s;t Time we &s;hould be together for a long Sea&s;on, we thought it be&s;t to &s;pend &s;ome Time in Prayer. Mr. <HI>Gilbert Tennent</HI> was our Mouth to God.&mdash;He prayed in the Holy Gho&s;t. Many were greatly affected. About 11 o' Clock we parted in Tears, but with a full A&s;&s;urance that we &s;hould &s;ee and hear of great Things before we &s;aw each other again in the Fle&s;h.

<PB N="16" REF="004851_0015_100E0216CEE2E5D8">me Freedom, and many Friends being in the Room, I kneeled down and prayed with and exhorted them all. But, Oh how did they melt under both; My Soul was much rejoiced to look round on them, be|cau&s;e there were &s;ome who were now fairly brought through the Pangs of the New-Birth, who had been mo&s;t marvellous Offenders again&s;t the great God. I &s;hall mention two only. The fir&s;t is one Mr. <HI>Brockden,</HI> Recorder of Deeds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <Q>a Man eminent in his Profe&s;&s;ion, but for many Years a notorious Dei&s;t. In his younger Days, he told me, he had &s;ome religious Impre&s;&s;ions, but coming into Bu|&s;ine&s;s, the Cares of the World &s;o choaked the good Seed, that he not only forgat his God in &s;ome Degree, but at length began to doubt of, and to di&s;pute his very Being. In this State he continued many Years, and has been very zea|lous to propagate his Dei&s;tical, I could almo&s;t &s;ay Athei&s;tical Principles among moral Men, but he told me he never endeavoured to make Pro&s;elytes of vicious, debauched People. When I came to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> this Time Twelve-month, he told me, he had not &s;o much as a Curio&s;ity to hear me. But a Brother Dei&s;t, his choice&s;t Friend, pre&s;&s;ing him to come and hear me, to &s;atisfy his Curio&s;ity, he at length complyed with his Reque&s;t, It was Night. I preach'd at the Court Hou&s;e Stairs, upon the Conference which our Lord had with <HI>Nicodemus.</HI>&mdash;I had not &s;poke much before God &s;truck his Heart. For, &s;aid he, I &s;aw your Doctrine tended to make People good. His Fa|mily knew nothing that he had been to hear me. After he came Home, his Wife, who ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a Sermon, came in al&s;o, and wi&s;hed heartily that he
<PB N="17" REF="004851_0016_100E021A2401AE90">had heard me. He &s;aid nothing. After this, another of his Family came in repeating the &s;ame Wi&s;h; and, if I mi&s;take not, after that another, till at la&s;t being; unable to refrain any longer, with Tears in his Eyes. Why, &s;ays he, I have been hearing him; and then expre&s;&s;ed his Approbation. Ever &s;ince he has followed on to know the Lord, and I verily believe Je&s;us Chri&s;t has made him&s;elf ma|nife&s;t to his Soul. Though upwards of three &s;core Years old, he is now I believe born again of God. He is a little Child, and often (as he told me) receives &s;uch Communications from God, when he retires into the Woods, that he thinks he could die a Martyr for the Truth.</Q> <Q>The next is one CAPTAIN H&mdash;L, formerly as great a Reprobate as ever I heard of: Almo&s;t a Scandal and Reproach to human Nature. He u&s;ed to Swear to ea&s;e his Stomach, and was &s;o fond of new Oaths that he u&s;ed to go on Board the Tran|&s;port Ships, and offer a Guinea for a new Oath, that he might have the Honour of coining it. It would be endle&s;s to give In&s;tances of his vile Pro|fanene&s;s. To the Honour of God's Grace let it be &s;aid, he is now, I believe, a Chri&s;tian. Not only reformed, but renewed. The effectual Stroke, he told me, was given, when I preached la&s;t Spring at <HI>Pennypack,</HI> though under good Impre&s;&s;i|ons before. Ever &s;ince he has been zealous for the Truth, &s;tood like a Lamb when was beaten, and in Danger of being murdered &s;ome time ago, by many of my Oppo&s;ers, and, in &s;hort, &s;hews forth his Faith by his Works.</Q> I might &s;peak al&s;o of &s;ome Quakers, who are fairly brought into an experimental Acquaintance with Chri&s;t, who are

And if he cho&s;e them at all, it mu&s;t be from Eternity, and that too without any Regard to any Thing fore&s;een in them. Unle&s;s they acknowledge this, Man's Salvation mu&s;t be in Part owing to the Free-Will of Man, and if &s;o, unle&s;s Men de&s;cend from other Parents than I did, Chri&s;t Je&s;us might have died, and never have &s;een the Travel of his Soul in the Salvation of one of his Creatures. But I would be tender in this Point and leave Per|&s;ons to be taught it of <HI>God.</HI> I am of the Mar|tyr <HI>Bradford's</HI> Mind.</Q> <HI>Let a Man go to the Grammar School of Faith and Repentance, before he goes to the Univer&s;ity of Election and Prede&s;tination.</HI> A bare Head-Knowledge of the Form of &s;ound Words availeth nothing.

<P><HI>Monday, November</HI> 10. Preached Morning and Afternoon to very large Congregations, and ob&s;erved a wonderful &s;weet Power attend both, but e&s;pecially the Evening-Sermon.

<P><HI>Saturday, November</HI> 15. Preached twice every Day this Week in the new Hou&s;e, one Morning excepted, when I preached in Mr. C&mdash;'s Meet|ing-Hou&s;e on Account of the Snow. A mo&s;t &s;weet and wonderful Power went at that Time through the Congregation. The Lord gave me the Text I preached on ju&s;t before Meeting; directed me to a Method as I was going up the Pulpit-Stairs; and enabled me to di&s;cour&s;e with an uncommon Clear|ne&s;s, Freedom, and Power. The Effects plainly &s;hewed that it was of God. &mdash; The Word &s;eemed to &s;mite them like &s;o many pointed Arrows. Ma|ny afterwards told me what they felt, and in the Evening I was &s;ent for to a young Woman, who was carried Home from Meeting, and had continued almo&s;t &s;peechle&s;s. When I came, &s;he look'd like a Per&s;on dead and laid out. I prayed with her, and heard afterwards that &s;he came out into a more com|fortable State.&mdash; <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be the Name of the Lord.</HI> Indeed I cannot &s;ay we had one dry Meeting. The lea&s;t Moving, I think, was one Afternoon, when I was unaccountable carried out to talk again&s;t Rea&s;oning Unbelievers. When I was at Dinner I had not fixed upon a Text. When I was going to preach, I was &s;o ill that &s;ome of my Friends advi&s;ed me to go Home. I thought it be&s;t to tru&s;t to God. I went on, began Preaching, and found my Heart, &s;omewhat refre&s;hed, but all on a &s;udden, my Soul was &s;o carried out to talk again&s;t depending on our natural Rea&s;on, that my Friends were a&s;toni&s;hed, and &s;o was I too: For I felt the Holy Gho&s;t come
<PB N="20" REF="004851_0019_100E02200319DE78">upon me at that Time, and never &s;pake on that wi&s;e before. <Q>As I was going Home, I &s;aid to a Friend, Surely &s;ome Rea&s;oners were in the Congregati|on.</Q> Upon Enquiry, I found a Clu&s;ter of them were pre&s;ent, and then I knew wherefore I was &s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ted. <HI>Oh who would but tru&s;t in God!</HI> One of the&s;e Rea&s;oners a little after, meeting Mr. <HI>B&mdash;n,</HI> &s;aid, <Q>What!

<P>Another Afternoon, there was &s;uch an univer&s;al Commotion in the Congregation, as I never &s;aw in <HI>Philadelphia</HI> before. One or two cried out in a mo&s;t piteous Manner, and Numbers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;orely, that I broke off Prayer after Sermon &s;ooner than otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have done. The Children of God were melted down, and their Souls magnified the Lord. I preached on tho&s;e Words, <HI>What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved?</HI> And as I afterwards found, was very providentially directed to that Subject. For one Mrs. <HI>P&mdash;r,</HI> as I have it in a Paper taken from her own Mouth, went to Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> to know, "Why I &s;hould not preach in the Church?" He, after &s;everal Invectives ca&s;t out again&s;t me, &s;aid,<HI>He could not an&s;wer his Oath to the Bi&s;hop of</HI> London, <HI>if he did give me Leave,</HI> and cautioned her again&s;t go|ing to hear me; adding, <HI>That if &s;he followed or adher|ed to what I &s;aid, &s;he was in a woful Condition."</HI> Nay, &s;aid he, <HI>You are damned if you do.</HI> With all, he told her, <HI>He was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in his Soul for her, becau&s;e &s;he

Then, Sir, replied &s;he, <Q>I mu&s;t believe in Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Doctrine.</Q> <HI>There now,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>you are running out again; I tell you, you are mad.

And &s;eeing &s;o many People admire Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Doctrine, and you &s;o, bitter again&s;t him, <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI> For you are enough to di&s;tract me between you.</Q> <HI>You are good enough,</HI> replied Mr. <HI>Cummins, and may dance or play at Cards and be in a far better Way than</HI> Whitefield <HI>or his Fol|lowers. &mdash; For my Part.

<PB N="22" REF="004851_0021_100E022455ACC078">Amen and Amen.</HI> It would be almo&s;t end|le&s;s to recount all the particular In&s;tances of God's Grace, which I have &s;een this Week pa&s;t. Many that before were only convicted, now plainly proved, that they were converted and had a clear Evidence of it within them&s;elves. My chief Bu&s;ine&s;s was now to build up and to exhort them to continue in the Grace of God. Notwith&s;tanding many were convicted almo&s;t every Day, and came unto me, un|der the greate&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s and Angui&s;h of Soul. Seve|ral Societies are now in the Town, not only of Men and Women, but of little Boys and little Girls. Being &s;o engaged, I could not vi&s;it them as I would, but I hope the Lord will rai&s;e me up &s;ome Fellow-Labourers, and that Elders will be ordained in every Place then we &s;hall &s;ee a glorious Church, &s;ettled and e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>Philadelphia. Ha&s;ten that Time, O Lord, my Strength &amp; my Redeemer.</HI> I cannot leave off giving an Account of this Week's Work, without menti|oning another In&s;tance or two of God's Grace. One Woman came to me, I think fairly converted to our dear Lord Je&s;us. She told me, when I was at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> la&s;t, <Q>She came de&s;iring that I would baptize her Child. I being otherwi&s;e enga|ged, refu&s;ed. Upon this the Devil a&s;&s;aulted her, being under &s;trong Convictions, in a mo&s;t violent Manner, and endeavoured to per&s;uade her, that all I had told her were Lies. She was ca&s;t into Darkne&s;s, but rea&s;oned thus, It is impo&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould be Lies, or that I &s;hould be a fal&s;e Pro|phet, &s;ince the Word came with &s;uch Light, E|vidence and un&s;peakable Power upon her Soul, when &s;he heard me. She went home, retired to Bed, and there the Devil would fain have per|&s;uaded
<PB N="23" REF="004851_0022_100E0225F5AEA918">her to cut her Child's Throat with a Pair of of Sci&s;&s;ars. She being bro't into the utmo&s;t Extre|mity, cried and looked up to Chri&s;t. He delive|red her out of her Di&s;tre&s;s. Satan immediately left her, and God flowed in upon her Soul. She now knows that her Redeemer liveth. <HI>Prai&s;e the Lord, O my Soul!</HI> Another young Woman, who I believe was made a wi&s;e Virgin la&s;t Spring, and received Je&s;us Chri&s;t in her Heart, acquain|ted me, "That &s;he continued in great Joy for near three Days, and went as far as <HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> to hear me, when I took my Leave la&s;t.

She fell into Darkne&s;s, retired into the Woods, and by Degrees, &s;he told me, &s;olid Comfort returned to her Soul.</Q> <HI>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>do you believe Electi|on?</HI> <Q>Yes &s;ays &s;he. with the utmo&s;t Confidence. It cannot but be &s;o.</Q> <HI>Oh that all who are preju|diced again&s;t that Doctrine were thus taught of God!</HI> They would not ignorantly call the Doctrine of E|lection the Doctrine of Devils, or cry out vehement|ly again&s;t the HORRIBLE DECREE. But, as an excellent Chri&s;tian ob&s;erves, <HI>The Doctrine of Election is &s;uch a glorious My&s;tery, that it dazzles the weak Eyes even of &s;ome of God's dear Children.</HI> But I have re&s;erved the mo&s;t &s;weet Proof of God's Grace and Power to the la&s;t. About the Middle of the Week I was called to vi&s;it one Mrs. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> then lying on a &s;ick Bed, but after prodigious Agonies, brought home to God when I was at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> la&s;t Spring. <Q>Her Hu&s;band was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> at Sea, and &s;ince his Re|turn home, has greatly per&s;ecuted his Wife, deny|ing
<PB N="24" REF="004851_0023_100E022822EF8310">her &s;piritual Friends leave to come unto her. God now inclined his Heart to let me come and pray with her, according to her De&s;ire. When I went the fir&s;t Time, he was not in the Room, but was offended that he was not called up to join with us. The next Day he him&s;elf met me in the Street, and gave me an Invitation. I compli|ed, and vi&s;ited his Wife &s;everal Times. But ne|ver before did I &s;ee a Soul &s;o exult in God, and talk &s;o &s;eelingly of the Love of Je&s;us, though &s;ometimes in Extremity of Pain. Sometimes &s;he was &s;o full of God that &s;he could not &s;peak, and at other Times, when &s;he could not &s;peak, and <HI>I bid her lift up her Hands if all was well,</HI> &s;he &s;tretched them with great Earne&s;tne&s;s. As &s;oon as ever &s;he could recover Breath, &s;he would talk of Je&s;us, &s;aying that his Love was above her Pain, that &s;he longed to be di&s;&s;olved, but was willing to tarry the Lord's Lei&s;ure. When I told her, <HI>that I wanted to be gone too.</HI> No, &s;ays &s;he, do you &s;tay longer, and bring home &s;ome more Souls to Chri&s;t; with many other gracious Words, which dropped from her Mouth. My Soul was much enlarged to hear a Creature talk with &s;uch A&s;&s;urance ju&s;t upon the Brink of Eternity. Her Hu&s;band and other Friends &s;tood weeping by.

One that was baptized brought three Children, I baptized them, prayed, and gave a Word of Exhortation with a melting Heart to many dear Souls. In the Evening I went with my dear Friend Mr. <HI>Noble</HI> to take a final Leave of Mrs. <HI>D</HI>&mdash;yet rejoicing in God.

<P><HI>Sunday, January</HI> 18. Continued on Board the&s;e two Days to &s;ettle our Ship Affairs, and di&s;patch &s;ome other Bu&s;ine&s;s. Was but Weak in Body.

<PB N="44" REF="004851_0043_100E0252B77BFAC0">with me.

<P>Sailed over <HI>Charle&s;town</HI> Bar, <HI>January</HI> 24. and ar|rived at <HI>Falmouth</HI> on the 11th of <HI>March.</HI> The Lord was plea&s;ed to give us a favourable Pa&s;&s;age. About three Days after we &s;et Sail, we had a violent Storm, which continued about four Hours. During the re&s;t of the Pa&s;&s;age, we had uncommonly plea&s;ant Wea|ther and fair Winds, till we came very near upon Soundings. Afterwards, the ble&s;&s;ed God was plea&s;ed to detain us near a Fortnight. But the Weather was plea&s;ant, and through the Bounty of our dear <HI>Charle&s;town</HI> Friends, we had all Things richly to en|joy. In the Beginning of the Voyage, my Body was Weak, and my Soul &s;omewhat low. But afterwards God was plea&s;ed to &s;trengthen me both in Body and Soul. The&s;e Words came one Day with great Power upon my Heart, <HI>Ari&s;e, Go into Nineveh, the great City, and preach unto it the Preaching that I bid thee.</HI> At another Time, the Lord &s;poke to me by the&s;e Words, <HI>Take the Foxes, the little Foxes that &s;poil the Vines: For our Vines have tender Grapes.</HI> This Part of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s Ble&s;&s;ing was one Night brought home to me with a &s;weet Power: <HI>The Archers have &s;orely grieved him, and that at him, and hated him.
