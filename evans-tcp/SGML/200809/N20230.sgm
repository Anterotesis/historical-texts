<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>CANDID READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was with much reluctance, that the author of the following pages permitted them to be publi&s;hed; as he has &s;till entertained an aver|&s;ion to religious controver&s;ies, which often are productive of di&s;|cord and animo&s;ity: he has no am|bition to be known as an author, as he has never made compo&s;ition his &s;tudy:&mdash;his &s;ole motive in wri|ting, is to vindicate the ways of God to man, who&s;e moral govern|ment has been gro&s;sly mi&s;repre|&s;ented, by many pious, well|meaning men, who have imbibed opinions and principles that are contrary to both &s;cripture and rea|&s;on, while they were young, and have omitted to give them a candid and critical examination at a more mature age. Some, mo&s;t proba|bly, are prevented by prejudice, from reading what has been writ|ten

by other denominations of chri&s;tians&mdash;and more by their con|&s;tant application to their re&s;pective profe&s;&s;ions and callings: probably a &s;hort tract, &s;uch as the following, may be better &s;uited to both de|&s;criptions, than a more lengthy treati&s;e; as curio&s;ity may excite, even a <HI>bigot</HI> to read a few pages, who could not be prevailed upon to buy, or read a large volume: and if it be found to contain even a clue, that may lead to a further in|ve&s;tigation of important truths, and the detection of error&mdash;it will &s;uit the man of bu&s;ine&s;s be&s;t; as it is only nece&s;&s;ary to &s;et the human mind in action, and furni&s;h it with a few &s;elf-evident principles, to en|able it to proceed in the inve&s;tiga|tion of the benevolent de&s;igns of the Deity, in the creation of man|kind, which mu&s;t have been to make them eternally happy, in glorifying and enjoying him; and if it be granted, that God created them for this end; he certainly has a &s;ufficient degree of wi&s;dom

and power to accompli&s;h his de|&s;ign, and cannot be fru&s;trated in the fulfilment of his gracious pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>As the future &s;alvation of man|kind depends entirely on the bene|volence, wi&s;dom and power of God, they are in &s;afe hands: his infinite benevolence in&s;pired him, to create them; his infinite wi&s;dom laid the plan for their redemption: and his in|finite power mu&s;t, and will accom|pli&s;h all that he has planned; although earth and hell &s;hould ari&s;e in oppo|&s;ition again&s;t him. How irrational, how un&s;criptural is it to &s;uppo&s;e, that God made any number of the human race, on purpo&s;e to make them eternally mi&s;erable?</P>
<P>Be candid, gentle reader; lay the prejudice of education a&s;ide, and examine the evidences for, and again&s;t the doctrine of eternal, ne|ver ending puni&s;hment, with free|dom&mdash;the &s;ubject is certainly weigh|ty and important, and claims your

&s;erious attention and diligent en|quiry. The honor of God and the good of mankind, are involved in its di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and deci&s;ion. If it is of importance for us to love God, it is certainly nece&s;&s;ary for us to know his true character; which is all glorious&mdash;when &s;tript of the mon&s;trous imputations of cruelty, attributed to him, by too many men, who are influenced more by cu&s;tom and tradition, than by &s;cripture and rea&s;on. It is a me|lancholy truth, that there are ma|ny ab&s;urd doctrines, founded upon a partial knowledge, and erroneous con&s;truction of the &s;criptures; this circum&s;tance alone &s;hould induce us to examine for our&s;elves, and not con&s;ide, too far, in the a&s;&s;umed infallibility of any &s;et, or &s;ect of men; and above all, &s;hould we &s;u&s;pect the tenets of tho&s;e, who at|tribute to the Deity, acts of inju&s;|tice and cruelty, that would &s;can|dalize and blacken the character of a Nero or an Herod! The doctrine of prede&s;tination, as taught by Cal|vin,
<PB N="ix" REF="026523_0007_0FD085615FC0B920">
is clearly of this kind: &s;ee his definition or prede&s;tination, in the 21&s;t chapter of the third book of his in&s;titution of the chri&s;tian reli|gion, 440th page, in the words fol|lowing; to wit, <Q>Prede&s;tination we call the eternal decree of God, whereby he had it determined with him&s;elf, what he <HI>willed</HI> to become of every man: for all are not created to like e&s;tate; but &s;ome to eternal life, and &s;ome to eternal <HI>damnation,</HI> is fore-appoint|ed. Therefore, as every man is created to the one or other end; &s;o we &s;ay, that he is prede&s;tinate, either to life or death. Page 443, This council, as touching the elect, we &s;ay, is grounded up|on his free mercy, without any re&s;pect to the worthine&s;s of man; but whom he <HI>appointeth to damna|tion,</HI> to them, by his ju&s;t indeed, and irreprehen&s;ible, but al&s;o in|comprehen&s;ible judgment&mdash;the <HI>entry of life is blocked up.</HI> Now in the elect, we &s;et vocation to be the te&s;timony of election;
<PB N="x" REF="026523_0008_0FD0853ED32F8790">
and then ju&s;tification to be ano|ther &s;ign, on the manife&s;t &s;hew|ing of it, till they come to glory, wherein is the fulfilling of it. But, as by vocation and election, God maketh his elect; &s;o, by &s;hutting out the <HI>reprobate,</HI> either from the knowledge of his name, or from the &s;anctification of his Spirit, he doth, as it were, by the&s;e marks, open what judg|ment abideth for them:</Q> which, according to his creed, is eternal, never ending <HI>damnation,</HI> without any regard either to his merit or deme|rit. The We&s;tmin&s;ter a&s;&s;embly of di|vines, proceeding upon the &s;ame grounds, in their an&s;wer to the que&s;tion, "What are the decrees of God;" affirm, that he has fore|ordained, what&s;oever comes to pa&s;s; &s;o that every event that ever has, or ever will come to pa&s;s, are all immutably e&s;tabli&s;hed, by a decree of the Deity, and con&s;equently are unavoidable by men; who are, ne|verthele&s;s, to be puni&s;hed to the endle&s;s ages of eternity, for acting
<PB N="xi" REF="026523_0009_0FD08562CE56AF50">
as the Deity had decreed they &s;hould do; they being reduced to the &s;hocking dilemma of acting, ei|ther contrary to the decrees or commands of their maker. When we contemplate this doctrine of the decrees, and compare <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> with their opinion of the fall of Adam, and its fatal con&s;equences, with re|&s;pect to his po&s;terity, who are &s;up|po&s;ed to have lo&s;t communion with God, to be under his wrath and cur&s;e, made liable to all the mi&s;e|ries of this life, to death <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and to the pains of hell forever&mdash;it &s;hould admoni&s;h us to embrace the opinions of the be&s;t of men, with caution, and to make u&s;e of our own rea&s;on, in examining the &s;crip|tures, on every important &s;ubject. The Deity has been plea&s;ed to make his attributes known to us; therefore, whatever conduct may be a&s;cribed to the Deity, that is incompatible with the perfections of the&s;e glorious attributes, mu&s;t be a groundle&s;s and fal&s;e imputa|tion, tending to injure the moral
<PB N="xii" REF="026523_0010_0FD085404E2287C0">
character of the &s;upreme ruler of the univer&s;e, and &s;hould be reject|ed. If we proceed agreeably to this rule, can we po&s;&s;ibly believe, with Calvin, "That infants bring their <HI>damnation</HI> out of their mo|ther's <HI>bellies</HI>?" And many others; who have taken Calvin for their &s;piritual guide, affirm, that there are millions of infants now in hell, who died before they were capa|ble of di&s;tingui&s;hing between good and evil, there to be puni&s;hed to the endle&s;s ages <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> eternity: be|cau&s;e, as they affirm, the&s;e infants were born &s;inners, and had never repented for Adam's tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion, and the corruption of their own natures&mdash;which they term original &s;in; which they a&s;&s;ert, ren|ders them ju&s;tly liable to the wrath and cur&s;e of God, both in this life, and that which is to come. This certainly cannot be the doctrine of the benevolent Je&s;us, who &s;aid, "Suffer little children to come unto me, for of &s;uch is the kingdom of heaven." And again, except ye
<PB N="xiii" REF="026523_0011_0FD085655B21C530">
be converted, and become as little children, ye &s;hall in no wi&s;e enter into the kingdom of heaven. Sure|ly if little children were in &s;uch a corrupt and damnable &s;tate, as Cal|vin and his followers have repre|&s;ented them to be, Chri&s;t, who was, undoubtedly, a very competent judge, would never have &s;et them up, as fit <HI>patterns</HI> and <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> for the kingdom of heaven, without intimating the nece&s;&s;ity of any change being wrought in them; the pre&s;umption, therefore, is, that they are perfectly innocent.</P>
<P>Whoever will be at the pains to contra&s;t the declarations of the Deity, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek.xviii.</NOTE> contained in Ezekiel, with the doctrines of Calvin and his ad|herents, will &s;oon be convinced that they are as oppo&s;ite to each other as light is to darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>Ezekiel begins the chapter, by the command of God, &s;aying, "What mean ye, that ye u&s;e this proverb concerning the land of I&s;|rael, &s;aying, the father's have eaten
<PB N="xiv" REF="026523_0012_0FD08541C97D3AD0">
four grapes, and the children's teeth are &s;et on edge?"</P>
<P>He &s;wears, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek xviii. 3.</NOTE> "That they &s;hall not have occa&s;ion any more, to u&s;e this proverb in I&s;rael:" however, the Calvini&s;ts have had great occa&s;ion to make frequent u&s;e of it, &s;ince Ezekiel's time.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, <NOTE PLACE="marg">4.</NOTE> "Behold, all &s;ouls are mine, as the &s;oul of the Father, &s;o al&s;o the &s;oul of the &s;on, is mine, the &s;oul that &s;inneth it &s;hall die."</P>
<P>"Yet &s;ay ye, <NOTE PLACE="marg">19.</NOTE> why doth not the &s;on bear the iniquity of the father, when the &s;on hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all my &s;tatutes, and hath done them, he &s;hall &s;urely live."</P>
<P>"The &s;oul that &s;inneth, <NOTE PLACE="marg">20.</NOTE> it &s;hall die: the &s;on &s;hall not bear the ini|quity of the father, neither &s;hall the father bear the iniquity of the &s;on, the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the righ|teous &s;hall be upon him, and the wickedne&s;s of the wicked &s;hall be upon him."</P>
<P>That is to &s;ay, that every indi|vidual &s;hall &s;uffer &s;or their own
<PB N="xv" REF="026523_0013_0FD085669088F4B8">
tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and not for that of any other per&s;on whatever.</P>
<P>The Deity a&s;&s;erts, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezekiel xxviii. iv.</NOTE> that all &s;ouls, without exception, are his proper|ty; if &s;o, they cannot belong to him and the Devil in common. However widely they may &s;tray from the &s;heep-fold for a time, the good &s;hepherd will, in due time, bring them home rejoicing, &s;aying, I have found that which was lo&s;t. And it will puzzle the Devil and all his advocates, to find and pro|duce that eternal decree, by which they pretend, that millions of in|fants were con&s;igned to him, to be and remain in the pri&s;on of hell, to the endle&s;s ages of eternity:</P>
<P>Or to prove from any thing con|tained in the &s;criptures of the Old or New Te&s;taments, that God ever threatened to puni&s;h any infant in hell, for the &s;ins of their parents, or tho&s;e of any other per&s;on: and, as it is impo&s;&s;ible, that tho&s;e who die in infancy, could ever offend him, in thought, word or deed; it is ir|rational to &s;uppo&s;e he will puni&s;h
<PB N="xvi" REF="026523_0014_0FD0854353826E38">
them, for any &s;uppo&s;ed want of conformity in their natures to his divine law. Would not the man be &s;tigmatized as a mo&s;t mercile&s;s tyrant, who &s;hould beget a va&s;t number of children, and deliver the greate&s;t number of them, while infants, into the hands of the mo&s;t mercile&s;s &s;avages, to be tormented by them, in the manner u&s;ually practi&s;ed among&s;t them, &s;uch as roa&s;ting them before &s;low fires, drawing out their <HI>nails,</HI> with red hot pincers, cau&s;ing them to run bare-footed on hot embers, then to break the bli&s;ters open, and rub in &s;alt, to increa&s;e the angui&s;h to the mo&s;t extreme degree, while the fa|ther's &s;tood by to approve and &s;anc|tion their proceedings?</P>
<P>I acknowledge that this charac|ter is drawn in very black and di&s;|mal colours; and I confe&s;s that I do not believe that the prince of Devils would act agreeable to it, were it in his power: but mon&s;trous and incredible as it may appear; &s;uch is the character, and &s;uch the
<PB N="xvii" REF="026523_0015_0FD08568136E03A8">
conduct attributed to the merciful and infinitely benevolent parent of mankind; with this additional ag|gravating circum&s;tance, that the puni&s;hment, in the fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed ca&s;e, could be only of &s;hort dura|tion; while that &s;uppo&s;ed to be in|flicted by the appointment of the Deity, is affirmed to be an eternal, never ending torture, of the mo&s;t dreadful kind, in the regions of darkne&s;s and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>This is the horrid form in which the&s;e &s;hocking doctrines have al|ways pre&s;ented, them&s;elves to the mind of the author: how they may appear to tho&s;e who embrace them, he cannot tell; or how they can reconcile them, to the ideas that are generally conceived of the glo|rious attributes of the Deity, or what is generally reckoned ju&s;t and merciful, among men in civil Soci|ety. A per&s;on would be naturally led to conceive, that the moral go|vernment of the Deity, would be the mo&s;t perfect model to imitate, in framing ours; but if the Calvin|i&s;tic
<PB N="xviii" REF="026523_0016_0FD08544D4EFE0E8">
plan is to be adopted, the only imitations of it appears to be the inqui&s;itions of Spain and Portugal; but it is very que&s;tionable, whether they ever proceeded &s;o far, as to <HI>burn infants</HI> for the crimes of their parents. If any per&s;on &s;hould con|ceive that the author of this little tract, has &s;hewn too great a degree of warmth, or made u&s;e of any ex|pre&s;&s;ions calculated to give offence, it will give him &s;en&s;ible concern; but if this &s;hould be the ca&s;e, he a&s;&s;ures the reader, that it never was his intention to offend the people of any denomination: his &s;ole mo|tive being to vindicate the moral character of the Deity; which, as he humbly conceives, has been gro&s;sly mi&s;repre&s;ented, to the di&s;|honor of God, and the un&s;peakable detriment of mankind&mdash;who &s;hould be taught to copy after the Deity, in all his immitable perfections: if, therefore, we form erroneous con|ceptions of the character and con|duct of the Deity, with re&s;pect to his di&s;po&s;ition and government of
<PB N="xix" REF="026523_0017_0FD085698F78DC78">
the children of men, it is almo&s;t morally certain, that our conduct, to each other, will be influenced by our opinions. If a bigot conceives that God hates any denomination of Chri&s;tians, or even the Heathen, it is highly improbable that he &s;hould love them, or treat them with kindne&s;s&mdash;as he will think him&s;elf ju&s;tifiable in hating whom God hates: and it is unlikely that Calvin would have burned Servetus for here&s;y, if he had not per&s;uaded him&s;elf, that God hated him from all eternity, and would puni&s;h him in hell, throughout eternal ages.</P>
<P>Jeremiah has predicted, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. xxxi. 29.</NOTE> "That the days will come, in which the Lord will make a new covenant with the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, and with the hou&s;e of Judah: not according to the covenant he made with their fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt." <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. xxxi. 29.</NOTE> "But this &s;hall be the covenant that I will make with the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, after tho&s;e days, &s;aith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts,

<P>God's government of the Jews, appears to be an epitome of his uni|ver&s;al government: we have rea&s;on, therefore, to expect, that the time is fa&s;t approaching, when we &s;hall all know the Lord, from the lea&s;t to the greate&s;t; and when he will forgive our iniquities, and remember our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions no more.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I. TO A FRIEND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I had the plea&s;ure of conver&s;ing with you, a few evenings ago, I &s;tated a few propo|&s;itions, tending to analize the doc|trine of the eternal duration of hell torments; &s;o as to have the &s;ub|ject compri&s;ed in a &s;mall compa&s;s, on a few &s;elf evident principles.&mdash;But as the &s;ubject is of great im|portance, involving in its di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and deci&s;ion, the ju&s;t or erroneous opinion we are to form of the moral character of the Deity; that is, whether we &s;hall believe that the Deity has created millions of hu|man beings, <HI>knowing</HI> with <HI>certain|ty,</HI> before he brought them into ex|i&s;tence, that they would prove in|corrigible &s;inners, incur his divine di&s;plea&s;ure, and that he, in con&s;e|quence, &s;hould con&s;ign them to
<PB N="2" REF="026523_0020_0FD08548A0625438">
eternal puni&s;hment in the regions of mi&s;ery and woe:</P>
<P>Or, whether he created them with the benevolent <HI>de&s;ign</HI> or <HI>wi&s;h</HI> that they might all be eventually happy, knowing that he had &s;uffi|cient abilities to fulfil his gracious intention. I would beg leave to &s;tate the following queries: viz.</P>
<P>Query I. When the Deity conceived the de&s;ign of creating, or cau&s;ing &s;o many millions of human beings to exi&s;t; did he <HI>wi&s;h</HI> or <HI>de|&s;ign</HI> that they &s;hould all be even|tually happy? Or did he not wi&s;h them final happine&s;s?</P>
<P>Query II. Did he know what their future conduct in this life would be?</P>
<P>Query III. Was he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;ufficient degree of <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> to form a <HI>plan</HI> whereby the whole human race might be re&s;cued from eter|nal mi&s;ery?</P>
<P>Query IV. Had he a &s;ufficient degree of power to execute his plan, and &s;ave the whole human race from eternal perdition?</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="026523_0021_0FD0856CC30FE3C8">If it be granted, as I conclude it mu&s;t be; that the Deity was &s;o be|nevolent as to <HI>wi&s;h</HI> that the whole human race might be eventually happy;</P>
<P>That he knew before hand what the conduct of each individual would be;</P>
<P>That he had <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> enough to form a <HI>plan</HI> to effect his gracious de&s;ign;</P>
<P>And a &s;ufficient degree of <HI>power</HI> to execute his <HI>plan</HI> and &s;ave the whole human race from eternal perdition;</P>
<P>Query V. What <HI>power,</HI> or combination of <HI>powers</HI> can <HI>fru&s;trate</HI> the <HI>de&s;igns</HI> of the <HI>Omnipotent Jeho|vab,</HI> and drag the&s;e beings to end|le&s;s perdition, which he intended &s;hould be eventually happy?</P>
<P>Query VI. What degree of cre|dit are we to give to the opinion of tho&s;e who tell us, that notwith|&s;tanding the infinite <HI>goodne&s;s, wi&s;|dom,</HI> and <HI>Almighty power,</HI> of the <HI>Deity</HI> are engaged to <HI>&s;ave</HI> the whole race, va&s;t numbers of them mu&s;t,

neverthele&s;s, be irrecoverably con|&s;inged to the Devil, to be torment|ed by him to the endle&s;s ages of eternity? Nay, there are many who allege that the po&s;terity of Adam are brought into being, with a na|tural and moral incapacity of do|ing any <HI>good</HI>; but with a &s;trong propen&s;ity, and infinite power to do evil. In con&s;equence of which di&s;po&s;ition and power, every &s;in which they commit is an infinite evil, and every &s;ub&s;equent tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion which they commit, being al&s;o an infinite evil, the &s;um total be|comes infinitely infinite; render|ing the mi&s;erable culprit ju&s;tly liable to eternal puni&s;hment, for acting a|greeably to the con&s;titution and pro|pen&s;ities of his nature, with which the Deity impelled him into exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Query VII. Is it not impious to &s;uppo&s;e, that an infinitely good and merciful God, &s;hould bring into exi&s;tence millions of human be|ings, under a moral incapacity of doing good; but with the &s;trong|e&s;t inherent propen&s;ities and pow|ers

<HEAD>LETTER II. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I pre&s;umed &s;ome time ago to trouble you with my &s;entiments concerning the final re&s;toration of the human race; I con&s;idered the &s;ubject, as it re|&s;pected our ideas of the unlimited pre&s;cience, goodne&s;s, wi&s;dom, and almighty power of God. And I am &s;till per&s;uaded that this is the mo&s;t rational method of inve&s;tigat|ing this important &s;ubject: for if the Deity be omni&s;cient, he mu&s;t have known what would eventual|ly be the fate of every individual created being. If he is infinitely <HI>good</HI> and <HI>merciful,</HI> he mu&s;t un|doubtedly wi&s;h to make them even|tually happy. If he be infinitely
<PB N="14" REF="026523_0031_0FD0855250277F80">
wi&s;e, he mu&s;t have laid his plan, &s;o as to prevent being fru&s;trated in the accompli&s;hment of his gracious de&s;ign. And if infinitely <HI>power|ful,</HI> all the ob&s;tructions or ob&s;tacles that the united powers of all cre|ated beings could oppo&s;e to the operations of his almighty will, would be in vain; nay, wor&s;e than in vain.</P>
<P>If, therefore, any number of the human race, are to be con&s;igned to the Devil, to be tormented in the regions of darkne&s;s and de&s;pair, to the endle&s;s ages of eternity, it mu&s;t happen in con&s;equence of &s;ome defect in the pre&s;cience, good|ne&s;s, wi&s;dom, or power of the De|ity. To &s;uppo&s;e the infinitely merciful and good God, capable of forcing any number of human beings into exi&s;tence, without wi&s;h|ing to make the condition into which he brought them equal, if not preferable, to a &s;tate of non|exi&s;tence, is &s;hocking, (and I pre|&s;ume there are but few, if any, who will a&s;&s;ert, that a &s;tate of eter|nal
<PB N="15" REF="026523_0032_0FD085740EE2F960">
puni&s;hment, is either equal or preferable to non-exi&s;tence.)</P>
<P>But, &s;uppo&s;ing him to have known, from all eternity, that they would be mo&s;t exqui&s;itely mi&s;erable throughout eternal ages, without any po&s;&s;ibility of relief; is to &s;up|po&s;e the ever merciful Jehovah guilty of an unprovoked act of cru|elty: for it is certain non-entities could not offend him. It is, there|fore, dealing unfairly with the cha|racter of the Deity, to charge him with an act of cruelty of which no human being would be guilty.&mdash; What man would beget a child, provided he knew with certainty before band, that it would be eter|nally mi&s;erable? I pre&s;ume there is not one to be found, that would not &s;hudder at the thought of be|ing in&s;trumental in producing a be|ing, knowing it &s;hould inevitably bear the mo&s;t excrutiating tor|ments in the regions of darkne&s;s, de&s;pair, and woe, as long as God him&s;elf exi&s;ted! But &s;hocking as it is, this is the character that has

<OPENER><SALUTE>My DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE trade of idol-making is a very ancient bu&s;ine&s;s; and has been practi&s;ed, with very little in|terruption, &s;ince the days of Serah. The fir&s;t &s;tep taken by almo&s;t every &s;y&s;tem-builder is, to fabricate a de|ity: but it &s;ometimes happens, that he finds one ready made to his hand; in which ca&s;e, he has only to furni&s;h him with a &s;et of at|tributes to &s;uit his purpo&s;e; and the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of the workman, may be infalibly known by the attributes with which he equips his deity.&mdash;Calvin was a tyrant; he cau&s;ed poor Servetus to be burned, becau&s;e he had the audacity to differ from him in opi|nion;

being bred a <HI>Papi&s;t,</HI> he had contracted a fondne&s;s for the dei|ty who pre&s;ided over the inqui&s;i|tion, becau&s;e he was &s;uppo&s;ed to burn all tho&s;e in hell to all eter|nity, who they burned here on earth for here&s;y; &mdash;not becau&s;e they had &s;inned again&s;t him, and had provoked him to bring them into exi&s;tence; &mdash;but becau&s;e he foreknew and decreed they &s;hould become &s;inners, that he might there|by have an opportunity of display|ing his Almighty power, and gra|tifying his vindictive ju&s;tice, by puni&s;hing them to the endle&s;s ages of eternity, for acting agreeably to the nature and di&s;po&s;itions with which he brought them into be|ing; &mdash;for the Calvini&s;ts a&s;&s;ert, that the po&s;terity of Adam, are born with the mo&s;t invincible propen&s;ity to do evil, and as entirely incapa|ble either to will or to do any good, as a dead man is to rai&s;e him&s;elf up, and perform the actions and functions of a living per&s;on, with|out the &s;pecial aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of

the Spirit of God, which he has a free <HI>&s;overeign right,</HI> either to <HI>grant</HI> or <HI>with hold,</HI> which he exerci&s;es without any refference to the <HI>good</HI> or <HI>bad di&s;po&s;ition,</HI> or <HI>conduct</HI> of ei|ther tho&s;e whom he has <HI>elected</HI> from all eternity to everla&s;ting life; or tho&s;e con&s;igned to eternal pu|ni&s;hment by an arbitrary <HI>decree</HI>; as he is &s;uppo&s;ed to be under no kind of obligation to the creatures he has made, and to have a free &s;overeign right to do, as he plea&s;es with them, as a potter has with an in&s;en&s;ible lump of clay.</P>
<P>I readily grant that Chri&s;t has a &s;overeign right, and am per&s;uaded that he has a di&s;po&s;ition to pardon Judas who betrayed him, and the Jews who murdered him, together with the whole of the inhabitants of Sodom, Samaria, and Jeru&s;alem: But I <HI>po&s;itively deny</HI> that he has either a <HI>&s;overeign right,</HI> or a di&s;po|&s;ition &s;o devoid of mercy; as to create an immortal rattle-&s;nake, on purpo&s;e to make it eternally mi|&s;erable, for acting agreeable to the

<P>Chri&s;t tells his hearers in his &s;er|mon on the Mount.</P>
<P>"Ye have heard that it has been &s;aid, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.

He incul|cates the&s;e principles as corre&s;pond|ing with the true moral character of the Father of mercies; for he &s;ubjoins in the 45 "that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his &s;un to &s;hine on the evil and on

the good, &amp;c." He further encou|rages them in the 48th ver&s;e, to proceed in the practice of the&s;e godlike virtues, that they might imitate the Deity in his moral per|fections; &s;aying, "Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in hea|ven is perfect."</P>
<P>This is, undoubtedly, a true de|&s;cription of the di&s;po&s;ition and mo|ral character of the greate&s;t and be&s;t of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> which Chri&s;t wi&s;h|ed his hearers to imitate, and cer|tainly he could not have given us a better pattern.</P>
<P>And the&s;e divine precepts he &s;anctioned and confirmed by his own example. When &s;uffering the mo&s;t excrutiating torments on the cro&s;s, he prayed for his mo&s;t bitter enemies and murderers, &s;ay|ing, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." If, therefore, Chri&s;t prayed to his Fa|ther, and made interce&s;&s;ion for tho&s;e who were murdering him, while, in the mo&s;t bitter agonies; who can rea&s;onably doubt that he will not be di&s;po&s;ed to intercede for the le&s;s

criminal part of mankind; or that his interce&s;&s;ion will not prevail with the Father of mercies to forgive them. Chri&s;t prayed for the whole promi&s;cuous group; if they were not, nor will not be eventually pardoned; then Chri&s;t's <HI>interce&s;&s;ion</HI> for them is <HI>unavailing.</HI> If they are <HI>forgiven,</HI> it is very remarkable that none except Calvin's <HI>elected, prede&s;tinated</HI> &s;aints, &s;hould be the only per&s;ons concerned in crucify|ing the Saviour of the world.</P>
<P>The above principles and facts, does not evince the Deity to be &s;uch an inexorable, cruel being, as ma|ny well-meaning people have con|ceived him to be. They &s;hould, therefore, be <HI>cautious,</HI> and not charge the Deity with <HI>partiality</HI> and <HI>cruelty</HI> in the di&s;pen&s;ations of his providence, with the children of men. Chri&s;t a&s;&s;ures us, in the 22d Ver&s;e, of the aforementioned Chapter; "That whoever &s;hall call his brother a fool, &s;hall be in danger of hell fire." what then mu&s;t the danger of that per&s;on be,

who calls his maker a tyrant?&mdash; God forbid, &s;ays the Calvini&s;t, that I &s;hould call God a tyrant! I only affirm that he has brought millions of human beings into exi&s;tence, out of a &s;tate of non-exi&s;tence, in which condition they were incapa|ble of either offending him, or &s;uf|fering any inconvenience, what|ever, <HI>knowing,</HI> and having <HI>prede|termined</HI> that they &s;hould be <HI>pu|ni&s;hed in bell flames,</HI> to the <HI>endle&s;s ages of eternity</HI>!

<P><PB N="34" REF="026523_0051_0FD08583CD3E55C8">An&s;wer. The decrees of God are his eternal purp&s;e, according to the council of his own will, whereby, for his own <HI>glory,</HI> he hath foreordained what&s;oever comes to pa&s;s. He decreed that he would, in time, create a man and woman, by the names of Adam and Eve, and con&s;titute Adam the head and repre&s;entative of all his po&s;terity; that he would enter into a cove|nant with him, on condition, that if he ab&s;tained from eating the fruit of a certain tree, him&s;elf and all his po&s;terity &s;hould be happy; but if he ta&s;ted the forbidden fruit, him&s;elf and all his po&s;terity &s;hould lo&s;e communion with God, be un|der his wrath and cur&s;e, and &s;o made liable to all the mi&s;eries of this life, to death it&s;elf, and to the pains of hell forever! And that in con&s;e|quence of Adam's tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion all his po&s;terity &s;hould be born with the mo&s;t invincible propen&s;ities to do evil, and both a natural and moral incapacity of doing any good, or even to will to do a good

action, and lea&s;t their natural pro|pen&s;ities to do evil, aided by the temptations of the Devil, &s;hould not in&s;tigate them &s;ufficiently to fill up the mea&s;ure of their iniqui|ty, the Deity is &s;uppo&s;ed to have decreed every evil action which they &s;hould commit; &s;uch as thefts, robberies, rapes, murders, &amp;c. For all which crimes and abomina|tions, he has al&s;o decreed to puni&s;h the greate&s;t number of the &s;ouls which he has made in <HI>hell,</HI> to the endle&s;s ages of eternity: for if the Deity has decreed <HI>what&s;oever</HI> comes to pa&s;s, all the&s;e crimes and abomi|nations have come to pa&s;s, and therefore mu&s;t have been included; for, &s;ay they, &s;ince God is omni&s;ci|ent, it is evident that he fore&s;aw from everla&s;ting, whatever &s;hould come to pa&s;s; but there can be no pre&s;cience for future contin|gents: for what is certainly fore|&s;een, mu&s;t infallibly come to pa&s;s; con&s;equently, the pre&s;cience of the Deity cannot be antecedent to his decrees.

Deity, by a free &s;overeign act of partiality, (he not being under the &s;malle&s;t obligation imaginable to regard the well being of the crea|tures he has made,) had cho&s;en a certain number in Chri&s;t, unto e|verla&s;ting glory, before the foun|dation of the world, according to his immutable purpo&s;e, and of his free grace and love, without the lea&s;t reference to faith, good works, or any conditions to be performed by the creature: and as he loved tho&s;e he elected without any rati|onal motive, &s;o he al&s;o hated tho&s;e he reprobated on the &s;ame ground, and left the poor wretched beings, which he dragged into exi&s;tence under his unprovoked di&s;plea&s;ure, not to be governed by the freedom of their own will, like moral ac|countable agents but pu&s;hed on to the greate&s;t degree of guilt and wretchedne&s;s, by acting as the De|ity had foreknown and decreed they &s;hould do! And the Deity is &s;up|po&s;ed never to have altered any of his decrees, <HI>except one,</HI> that would

have operated mercifully in their favour: to wit, "In the day thou eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die:" for &s;urely non-exi&s;tence would have been, at lea&s;t a nega|tive <HI>ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> to all tho&s;e who are &s;uppo&s;ed to be eternally damned!

<HEAD>LETTER IV. TO A FRIEND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS the chri&s;tian world has been greatly divided in opinion, re&s;pecting the motives which in|duced the Deity to create the hu|man &s;pecies, and his de&s;igns and intentions, with re&s;pect to their fu|ture face; as they are que&s;tions of great importance to human beings, both with re&s;pect to the ideas they are to form of the moral character of the Deity, and their own moral conduct, which &s;hould be conform|able to his.</P>
<P>It is natural for you to enquire; whether it is not po&s;&s;ible to gain a &s;atisfactory knowledge of a &s;ubject, which &s;o nearly concerns us, and yet appears &s;o va&s;tly intricate, that notwith&s;tanding the numerous vo|lumes
<PB N="76" REF="026523_0093_0FD085A416B4BE80">
that have been wrote upon the &s;ubject no rational conclu&s;ion, founded upon &s;elf-evident princi|ples, has ever been made by the advocates for the eternal duration of hell torments; and yet they are ready to anathematize every per&s;on who cannot believe all the &s;elf|contradictory opinions, in which they cannot agree them&s;elves:&mdash; &s;ome a&s;&s;erting that God wi&s;hed to convert and <HI>&s;ave</HI> the whole human race, but <HI>could</HI> not; others, that he <HI>could convert</HI> and <HI>&s;ave</HI> them <HI>all,</HI> but <HI>will not</HI>; he having doomed great numbers of them to eternal perdition, by an arbitrary decree, long before they exi&s;ted, and that he had created them for this very purpo&s;e. While others deny that God decreed that any per&s;on &s;hould inevitably be mi&s;erable to the end|le&s;s ages of eternity; but mo&s;t cer|tainly and infallibly knew, that they would be &s;o, even before he created them. While a few other per&s;ons believe, that God created every human being, with an expre&s;s
<PB N="77" REF="026523_0094_0FD085CB11504428">
and po&s;itive de&s;ign, to make them all eventually happy; and affirm that he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;ufficient degree of wi&s;dom and power, to enable him to accompli&s;h his bene|volent de&s;ign. As you appear to be &s;o benevolent as to wi&s;h every individual of the human race might be happy: I will endeavour to con|vince you that the doctrine is found|ed on the glorious attributes of God; on the &s;criptures, and the &s;elf-evident principles of rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Let us proceed then to the im|portant inve&s;tigation, and enquire;</P>
<P>Que&s;tion I. What motive induced the Deity to create &s;uch an immen&s;e number of human beings?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. To gratify his infinite beneficence, in conferring on them ble&s;&s;ings, both temporal and eter|nal, and the univer&s;al di&s;play of his glorious attributes and perfections in the manife&s;tations of providence, in their government.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion II. Is it certain, that he wi&s;hed or intended, that all the hu|man
<PB N="78" REF="026523_0095_0FD085A589D21190">
beings which he created might be happy?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. He certainly did;&mdash; otherwi&s;e he would not be as bene|volent as our common parents. And to &s;uppo&s;e the Deity capable of &s;orcing any number of human beings into exi&s;tence, without wi&s;h|ing to make the condition into which he brought them, equal, if not preferable to a &s;tate of non|exi&s;tence&mdash;would be charging him with an unprovoked act of cruelty: for it is certain that non-entities could not have offended him; it is therefore evident, that he never in|tended any of them &s;hould be even|tually mi&s;erable, when he created them: but, on the contrary, it is declared, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. ii. 4.</NOTE> "That <HI>God will</HI> have <HI>all men</HI> to be <HI>&s;aved,</HI> and come unto the knowledge of the truth."</P>
<P>Que&s;tion III. If God willed that all men &s;hould be &s;aved; had he wi&s;dom &s;ufficient to enable him to form a plan, to accompli&s;h his be|nevolent de&s;ign?</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="026523_0096_0FD085CC8D0D2408">An&s;wer. His wi&s;dom is infinite, and his goodne&s;s unlimitted, and the love of Chri&s;t unbounded, "Who gave him&s;elf a <HI>ran&s;om</HI> for all, <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Tim. vi.</NOTE> to be <HI>te&s;tified</HI> in <HI>due time.</HI>"&mdash;</P>
<P>Que&s;tion IV. Has he a &s;ufficient degree of power to execute his plan?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. A union of the power of all created beings, would &s;till be finite; and therefore, fail in an at|tempt to oppo&s;e or counteract the <HI>de&s;igns</HI> and <HI>operations</HI> of the <HI>omnipo|tent</HI> Jehovah. If then it has been proved, that the Deity is &s;o bene|volent as to <HI>wi&s;h</HI> all men to be &s;av|ed; that he had wi&s;dom enough to form a plan to effect his gracious de&s;ign; and a &s;ufficient degree of power to execute his plan, and ac|compli&s;h his de&s;ign.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion V. What power, or combination of powers, terre&s;trial and infernal, &s;hall prevail again&s;t Jehovah, and fru&s;trate his de&s;igns? So that if any of the human race are to be eternally lo&s;t, it mu&s;t be &s;uch as God never wi&s;hed to &s;ave;

<HEAD>LETTER V. To A RIGID CALVINIST.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN, in conver&s;ation with you, I affirmed that St. Paul was an Univer&s;ali&s;t, I promi&s;ed to quote &s;ome of the mo&s;t pointed texts by which he inculcates the doctrine in the mo&s;t clear and po&s;i|tive terms.</P>
<P>"Therefore as by the offence of <HI>one,</HI> judgment came upon <HI>all men</HI> to condemnation, <HI>even &s;o</HI> by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>one,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. v. 18.</NOTE> the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> gift: came upon <HI>all men</HI> unto <HI>ju&s;tification</HI> of <HI>life.</HI>"</P>
<P>"He that &s;pared not his own Son; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. viii. 32.</NOTE> but delivered him up for <HI>us all,</HI> how &s;hall he not, with him al|&s;o, freely give us all things."</P>
<P>"For God hath concluded <HI>them
<PB N="93" REF="026523_0110_0FD085F74C66E188">
all in unbelief,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. xi. 32.</NOTE> that he might have <HI>mercy upon all.</HI>"</P>
<P>By the fir&s;t of the&s;e texts, it plainly appears; that Adam was the repre&s;entative of <HI>all his po&s;teri|ty,</HI> or of human nature in general, in as much as judgment unto con|demnation came upon <HI>all men</HI> for his offence; that Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by a&s;&s;uming the human nature, became as fully and compleatly the repre|&s;entative of <HI>all mankind,</HI> as Adam was, or had been; and therefore, by his <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> the <HI>free gift came upon all men,</HI> unto <HI>ju&s;tification</HI> of <HI>life.</HI></P>
<P>So you &s;ee, that St. Paul con&s;i|ders Chri&s;t as the compleat repre|&s;entative and <HI>Saviour</HI> of <HI>all man|kind</HI>; who, by his righteou&s;ne&s;s, had wrought out a compleat &s;alva|tion for the <HI>whole human race,</HI> unto the <HI>ju&s;tification</HI> of <HI>life</HI>; and if God <HI>ju&s;tifieth,</HI> who is he that <HI>condemn|eth</HI>?</P>
<P>And further to e&s;tabli&s;h them in the belief of this glorious doctrine, he argues, that as God &s;pared not
<PB N="94" REF="026523_0111_0FD085D40E8FFB48">
his own Son; but delivered him up for <HI>us all</HI>&mdash;he will, with him al&s;o, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> give us all things. And to convince them that Chri&s;t was not that partial Saviour, which many conceive him to be, who would &s;it down contentedly, with as many &s;ouls as the Devil plea&s;ed to give him. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. xi. 32.</NOTE> He tells the Romans, "That God had concluded <HI>them all in un|belief,</HI> that he might <HI>have mercy up|on all.</HI>"</P>
<P>"For as in Adam <HI>all die,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. xxv. 22.</NOTE> even &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall <HI>all be made alive.</HI>"</P>
<P>"For the love of Chri&s;t con|&s;traineth us, becau&s;e we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: And that he <HI>died for all,</HI> that they which live, &s;hould not henceforth, <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 5. 14.</NOTE> live unto them&s;elves, <NOTE PLACE="marg">15.</NOTE> but unto him who died for them, and ro&s;e again."</P>
<P>"For to this end Chri&s;t both di|ed, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. xiv. 9.</NOTE> and ro&s;e and revived, that he might be Lord of both the <HI>dead</HI> and <HI>living.</HI>" If &s;o, he mu&s;t be <HI>Lord</HI> of <HI>all.</HI></P>
<P>Saint Paul calls Chri&s;t "The
<PB N="95" REF="026523_0112_0FD085F8D07EA418">
image of the invi&s;ible God, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. i. 15.</NOTE> the fir&s;t born of every creature."</P>
<P>"For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. i. 16.</NOTE> and that are in earth, vi&s;ible and invi|ble; whether they be thrones or dominions, or principalities or powers; all things were created by <HI>him</HI> and <HI>for him.</HI>"</P>
<P>If therefore Chri&s;t made all things for him&s;elf, he mu&s;t deviate greatly from his original intention, before he gives up any thing to the Devil, e&s;pecially the &s;ouls which he has made for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"I exhort, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. ii. 1</NOTE> therefore, that fir&s;t of all, &s;upplications, prayers, interce&s;|&s;ions, and giving of thanks be made for <HI>all men.</HI>"</P>
<P>"For this is good and accepta|ble in the &s;ight of God our Saviour." <NOTE PLACE="marg">3,</NOTE></P>

all,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">6.</NOTE> to be te&s;tified in due time." &mdash; St. Paul exhorts Timothy, fir&s;t of all, to make &s;upplication, &amp;c. for <HI>all men,</HI> as being acceptable to God our Saviour, who is a being of &s;uch univer&s;al benevolence, as to <HI>will</HI> that <HI>all men</HI> &s;hould be <HI>&s;aved,</HI> and come to the knowledge of the truth. And whatever the omnipo|tent Jehovah <HI>wills</HI> to be done, he will certainly accompli&s;h. But the apo&s;tle, to &s;hew that the &s;alvation of <HI>all men,</HI> was not only po&s;&s;ible; but ea&s;ily practicable&mdash;he ob&s;erves, that there is one God to be appea&s;|ed, who is a God of infinite good|ne&s;s and mercy, who <HI>wills</HI> that <HI>all men</HI> may be <HI>&s;aved,</HI> and one media|tor between this <HI>gracious God</HI> and <HI>men</HI>; to wit, the man <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> who is the advocate and friend of mankind univer&s;ally, as he has al|ready given him&s;elf a ran&s;om; not for a few individuals, but for <HI>all mankind.</HI> And although this great and important truth, may not be generally known to the chief prie&s;ts and Phari&s;ees of our day, it &s;hall

neverthele&s;s be te&s;tified in due time; to the honor of God, and the un&s;peakable con&s;olation of eve|ry good being.</P>
<P>If, therefore, the &s;upreme <HI>God</HI> is &s;o <HI>benevolent,</HI> as to will that all mankind &s;hould be &s;aved, and has &s;ent his Son, on purpo&s;e to be the <HI>Saviour</HI> of the <HI>world</HI>: and Chri&s;t has, on his part, given him&s;elf a <HI>ran&s;om</HI> for <HI>all</HI>&mdash;then <HI>all</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>&s;aved.</HI></P>
<P>He who redeems or ran&s;oms captives, claims them as his own, and never leaves them in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the enemy.</P>
<P>Can there be any thing more ab&s;urd, than to &s;uppo&s;e, that after Chri&s;t had given his life a ran&s;om for the whole world of mankind&mdash; that he &s;hould, neverthele&s;s, leave va&s;t numbers of tho&s;e very beings, for whom he &s;hed his precious blood, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Devil eternally?</P>
<P>Chri&s;t is neither a partial Savi|our, nor a partial conqueror; he will never &s;ubmit to the Devil,
<PB N="98" REF="026523_0115_0FD085D7097923F0">
and permit him to retain one hu|man &s;oul in captivity, which he made for him&s;elf: for certainly he was not &s;o complai&s;ant as to make any &s;ouls, on purpo&s;e for the De|vil; and if the Devil &s;hould even|tually retain in <HI>captivity,</HI> any of the &s;ouls which Chri&s;t had made for him&s;elf, then is Chri&s;t defeated; and his de&s;igns fru&s;trated. And to &s;ay, that Chri&s;t has made &s;ouls, which he neither wi&s;hed to be happy, nor intended to &s;ave from endle&s;s perdition, is bla&s;phemy.</P>
<P>And I believe it would be thought much le&s;s derogatory to the cha|racter of the Deity, by every un|prejudiced per&s;on, to &s;uppo&s;e that he abandoned the creatures which he had made, to the permanent do|minion of the Devil, through a want of wi&s;dom and power to re&s;cue them; than to affirm that he had a &s;ufficient degree of wi&s;dom and power to &s;ave them; but that it was more agreeable to his divine will, that they &s;hould be eternally and irrecoverably mi&s;erable. If
<PB N="99" REF="026523_0116_0FD085FBCA468610">
we &s;uppo&s;e him to be infinitely be|nevolent, but deficient in wi&s;dom and power, this would be a great misfortune, which every good be|ing would deplore, and would wi&s;h to a&s;&s;i&s;t him: but, if on the con|trary, he is &s;uppo&s;ed to be infinite|ly wi&s;e and powerful; but &s;o <HI>male|volent,</HI> as to &s;peak unoffending, in|con&s;cious matter into exi&s;tence, in|fallibly knowing, that the condi|tion into which he brought it, was as much wor&s;e than that in which he found it, as a &s;tate of the mo&s;t &s;evere, eternal, never ending pu|ni&s;hment, is wor&s;e than a &s;tate of non-exi&s;tence, is horrid beyond de|&s;cription&mdash;but &s;o it is. The Cal|vini&s;ts having determined, that va&s;t numbers of the human race mu&s;t be eternally damned, rather than give up this darling tenet, they bla&s;pheme the moral character of the Deity, by affirming that he forces into exi&s;tence millions of hu|man beings, morally incapable of doing any good; but replete with the &s;tronge&s;t propen&s;ities to do evil,
<PB N="100" REF="026523_0117_0FD085D88A94D4F0">
which can neither be <HI>restrained</HI> or <HI>eradicated,</HI> by any thing which they can do.

<P>"For God &s;ent not his Son into the world, <NOTE PLACE="marg">John iii. 17.</NOTE> to condemn the world; but that the <HI>world,</HI> through him might be &s;aved." In the above cit|ed texts, it appears, that God is the mo&s;t benevolent of all beings, his very e&s;&s;ence is love; his benevo|lence in&s;pired him to create us; he &s;o loved the world, as to &s;end his dearly beloved Son, to be a propi|tiation for our &s;ins, and the Saviour of the world. It &s;hould be the bu|&s;ine&s;s of our teachers to exhibit the Deity in his true character, which is that of infinite love, and un|bounded benevolence to all created beings; he hates &s;in, becau&s;e it has a natural and nece&s;&s;ary tendency to create confu&s;ion, mi&s;ery and di&s;|order; but Chri&s;t loved mankind and died for them, while they were yet in a &s;tate of rebellion again&s;t him. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. v. 6, 8.</NOTE></P>

<P>Therefore, people &s;hould never be taught to believe that God is as much glorified and plea&s;ed with the death and eternal damnation of a &s;inner, as in the &s;alvation and eternal felicity of a &s;aint.

<HEAD>LETTER VI. TO A FRIEND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN we had the la&s;t con|ver&s;ation, re&s;pecting the motives which induced the infinite|ly good and merciful God to cre|ate the human &s;pecies: you alledg|ed that he had done it to di&s;play the glory of his divine attributes, to which opinion I cheerfully a|gree. But the point in di&s;pute be|tween us, is,</P>
<P>Whether the&s;e divine attributes are not di&s;played, in a more glori|ous, ju&s;t and merciful manner, in the final &s;alvation, and everla&s;ting happine&s;s of every human being, which God has created; than in the eternal damnation, and ever|la&s;ting mi&s;ery of any number of them? Therefore, to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in the
<PB N="108" REF="026523_0125_0FD085DFA7AACCE8">
inve&s;tigation of this important &s;ub|ject; we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the &s;criptures, and &s;uch &s;elf-evident principles and axioms, as the light of rea&s;on, and the nature of the &s;ubject will furni&s;h.</P>
<P>The proper &s;teps to be taken in this ca&s;e is, to enquire,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. What is God?</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. What are his attributes?</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. For whom, and for what end did he create us?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>And, in the fir&s;t place, I &s;hall define God; who&s;e very e&s;&s;ence is love, "To be a &s;pirit, infinite, eternal, and unchangeable in his being;" who&s;e attributes are infi|nite mercy, wi&s;dom, power, holi|ne&s;s, ju&s;tice, goodne&s;s and truth. The fir&s;t propo&s;ition to be proved, is, that God is love; which is &s;uf|ficiently apparent in his works of creation and providence; but point|edly proved in John, "He that loveth not, knoweth not God, for <HI>God is love</HI>" <NOTE PLACE="marg">I John iv, 8, 16.</NOTE> <NOTE PLACE="marg">I John iv. 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>"And we have known and be|lieved the <HI>love</HI> that God hath to

us. <NOTE PLACE="marg">16.</NOTE> <HI>God</HI> is <HI>love</HI>; and he that dwelleth in <HI>love,</HI> dwelleth in God, and God in him. <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 John 9. 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>In this was manife&s;ted the <HI>love</HI> of God, towards us, becau&s;e that God hath &s;ent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 John ii. 1.</NOTE> Herein is <HI>love,</HI> not that we loved God; but that he <HI>loved</HI> us, and &s;ent his Son to be the propitiation for our &s;ins: but lea&s;t it &s;hould be &s;aid, that he is the propitiation, for the &s;ins of the few that are &s;uppo&s;ed to be elected only; I &s;hall quote, "And if any man &s;in, we have an advocate with the Father, Je&s;us Chri&s;t the righ|teous."</P>
<P>"And he is the propitiation for our &s;ins; and not for ours only, but al&s;o for the <HI>&s;ins</HI> of the <HI>whole world.</HI>"</P>
<P>Pre&s;uming that enough has been &s;aid on this head, to prove the im|partial <HI>love</HI> of the Deity to all man|kind: and al&s;o, that the enumera|tion of the attributes of the Deity, will not be di&s;puted. I &s;hall pro|ceed,
<PB N="110" REF="026523_0127_0FD085E0CC299620">
in the third place, to prove, that God made all the &s;ouls of mankind for him&s;elf; with the mo&s;t expre&s;s and benevolent de|&s;ign, to make them all eventually happy, in prai&s;ing and glorifying his holy name, for his infinite <HI>love</HI> and kindne&s;s towards them, and to enjoy the manife&s;tations of his un|bounded goodne&s;s forever.</P>
<P>Every &s;oul, created by the Dei|ty, mu&s;t be <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>innocent,</HI> and as &s;uch, he mu&s;t <HI>love</HI> it, and wi&s;h a continuation of its happine&s;s: but if he foreknew, (as the Calvini&s;ts &s;uppo&s;e) that it would be eternally mi&s;erable, if it remained in exi&s;t|ence, he, as a merciful being, would blot it out of exi&s;tence again, while in a &s;tate of innocence. But as it is univer&s;ally allowed among&s;t chri&s;tians, that there are but two places of permanent re&s;idence, for departed &s;ouls after this life; to wit, heaven and hell; and but two beings who are to divide the &s;ouls of the human &s;pecies between them; to wit, God and the Devil:
<PB N="111" REF="026523_0128_0FD086059E5FA280">
we mu&s;t endeavour, by a careful inve&s;tigation of their different powers and attributes, to judge of their final &s;ucce&s;s, with re&s;pect to their efforts to gain &s;ubjects, and depopulate each others kingdoms; and to enable us to do this, let us e&s;tabli&s;h a few &s;elf-evident propo|&s;itions, as axioms.</P>
<P>It is the exclu&s;ive prerogative of the Deity to create &s;ouls.</P>
<P>No other being can create them.</P>
<P>Therefore he has created all the &s;ouls that ever have exi&s;ted.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. When, he created them, he either intended that they &s;hould be eternally mi&s;erable: Or,</ITEM>
<ITEM>II He did not care what became of them: Or,</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. He wi&s;hed, and de&s;igned, that they &s;hould be eventually happy.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>To affirm the fir&s;t, is bla&s;phe|mous.</P>
<P>The &s;econd, impiou&s;ly ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>Therefore, the third mu&s;t be true.</P>
<P>God is infinitely <HI>benevolent, wi&s;e</HI>
<PB N="112" REF="026523_0129_0FD085E24E498438">
and <HI>powerful</HI>: therefore, being in|finitely benevolent, he wi&s;hed and de&s;igned, that all the &s;ouls which he made, might be eventually hap|py.</P>
<P>Being infinitely wi&s;e, he has cer|tainly concerted his plan, &s;o as not to be fru&s;trated, in the accompli&s;h|ment of his gracious de&s;ign.</P>
<P>And being infinitely powerful, no combination of finite powers, can ever amount to infinite; and if &s;till finite, they mu&s;t ultimately fail in the attempt, to counteract and fru&s;trate the operations and de|&s;igns of an omnipotent God; who will make a mo&s;t <HI>glorious</HI> di&s;play of his divine attributes, in vanqui&s;h|ing the powers of death and hell, and relea&s;ing every captive and pri&s;oner out of the pit, wherein is no water.</P>
<P>Is it not amazingly ab&s;urd, to &s;uppo&s;e, that a God of infinite goodne&s;s, ju&s;tice and mercy, has created millions of human beings, on purpo&s;e for the Devil, to be his captives and pri&s;oners, to the end|le&s;s
<PB N="113" REF="026523_0130_0FD086070991D828">
ages of eternity? But is it not more ab&s;urd, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Deity made them for him&s;elf, with the benevolent de&s;ign of rendering them eternally hap|py, in prai&s;ing and adoring his ho|ly name, for his infinite <HI>love</HI> and goodne&s;s towards them; but con|trary to his gracious de&s;igns, that millions of the&s;e very beings, are to be, and remain in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and under the powers of the De|vil, to be tormented by him, to the endle&s;s ages of eternity?</P>
<P>If &s;uch an event &s;hould finally take place, then it is certain, that finite folly, weakne&s;s, and wicked|ne&s;s, can overpower, baffle, fru|&s;trate and defeat, the benevolent de&s;igns and operations, of infinite goodne&s;s, wi&s;dom, and almighty power, and triumph over omnipo|tence.</P>
<P>If any individual of the human race is to be mi&s;erable, as long as God him&s;elf exi&s;ts; it mu&s;t happen through a defeat of benevolence, wi&s;dom or power in the Deity.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="026523_0131_0FD085E3D18AA960">Therefore, the prede&s;tinarians deny God's infinite <HI>goodne&s;s,</HI> when they maintain, that God <HI>could,</HI> but <HI>would</HI> not convert all his creatures. The Socinians deny his infinite <HI>power,</HI> when they maintain, that he <HI>would</HI> but <HI>cannot</HI> convert them; and will be obliged one day to an|nihilate all reprobate &s;pirits! The premi&s;es being ab&s;urd, an ab&s;urd conclu&s;ion is to be expected.</P>
<P>The Univer&s;ali&s;ts affirm, that it is incompatible with the divine love, infinite ju&s;tice and mercy of the Deity, to create human beings, knowing that the condition into which he brought them, would be as much wor&s;e than that in which they were&mdash;as a &s;tate of eternal, never ending mi&s;ery, under the in|finite di&s;plea&s;ure of an offended God, is wor&s;e than a &s;tate of non|exi&s;tence, in which condition they could neither offend the Deity, nor &s;uffer any inconvenience whatever.</P>
<P>They, therefore, believe that the Deity created the whole human race, with a po&s;itive determination
<PB N="115" REF="026523_0132_0FD086088B543CF0">
to make the condition, into which he brought them, va&s;tly preferable to a &s;tate of non-exi&s;tence: and that it would be an unprovoked act of cruelty to make it <HI>wor&s;e</HI>; be|cau&s;e the materials of which the future being was to con&s;i&s;t, could not offend him, before it exi&s;ted as a moral accountable agent, capa|ble of di&s;tingui&s;hing between good and evil, with a free will to choo&s;e, and a power of action, to do either good or evil, agreeable to the free choice of the will. If, therefore, the Deity foreknew, that any be|ing, which he might create, would, by making an improper u&s;e of its free agency, become eternally and irrecoverably mi&s;erable, he cer|tainly never would force it into exi&s;tence, which would be a &s;evere unmerited puni&s;hment inflicted, prior to the po&s;&s;ibility of offence, or tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion on the part of the being puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>To &s;ay, that the infinitely graci|ous and merciful Deity's foreknow|ledge, that a certain individual non|entity,
<PB N="116" REF="026523_0133_0FD085E54C4A3D80">
would, if <HI>created,</HI> make an improper u&s;e of its free agency, and become an incorrigible &s;inner, had provoked him to drag it into exi&s;t|ence, to puni&s;h it eternally; not for any evil it had done&mdash;but for what he foreknew it would do&mdash;is charging him with making an ex|tremely cruel, and improper u&s;e of his own free agency: not only to do evil, that good might come, but doing evil of the mo&s;t barbarous kind, for the &s;ake of evil, from which no good could po&s;&s;ibly re|&s;ult&mdash;which is impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>This is not only charging God fooli&s;hly; but wickedly. If the Devil is not extremely ungrateful indeed, he mu&s;t have precious re|wards in &s;tore, for tho&s;e who u&s;e, every po&s;&s;ible means in their power, to per&s;uade people that the Deity is the the greate&s;t tyrant of the two. But the God of ju&s;tice, love, and mercy, knowing what pains would be taken to traduce his mo|ral character, directed the prophet Ezekiel to record the following
<PB N="117" REF="026523_0134_0FD0860A2DDB5588">
oath; to wit, "As I live, &s;aith the Lord God, I have no plea&s;ure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way, and live." If we believe what the Deity has &s;worn in this ca&s;e; we mu&s;t di&s;believe that he has ever created one &s;oul, knowing that it would be &s;o ob&s;tinately and per&s;everingly wicked; that infinite wi&s;dom goodne&s;s and almighty pow|er could not reform and reclaim it. If it be &s;aid, that the Deity could not &s;ave it, con&s;i&s;tently with the plan he had cho&s;en: I an&s;wer; that the plan could not have been the pro|duction of infinite wi&s;dom, which prevented the Deity from accom|pli&s;hing his original de&s;ign; which mu&s;t have been to make every be|ing which he created, eventually happy.</P>
<P>To affirm that an human being, in a &s;tate of extreme, eternal, ne|ver ending mi&s;ery, is as happy as the Deity intended or de&s;igned he &s;hould ever be, at the time he cre|ated him&mdash;is bla&s;phemy. If God
<PB N="118" REF="026523_0135_0FD085E7DA269868">
intended that all the &s;ouls which he created, &s;hould be eventually hap|py, and gave them exi&s;tence, as a po&s;itive ble&s;&s;ing, and not as a cur&s;e: and not with &s;tanding many millions are &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;i&s;t the benevolent de&s;igns of the Deity, and ba&s;&s;le all the means that could be employed by the Deity, for their conver&s;ion. The que&s;tion na|turally recurs;</P>
<P>How can it be po&s;&s;ible, that finite folly, weakne&s;s and wicked|ne&s;s, &s;hould eternally overpower, baffle, fru&s;trate and defeat the de|&s;igns and operations of the divine love, infinite wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s and almighty power? But the Calvin|i&s;ts, to ju&s;tify the mea&s;ure of in|flicting an infinite, eternal, never ending puni&s;hment, for temporary crimes, committed, in time, by finite beings, have laboured to per|&s;uade us, that every &s;in is an infi|nite evil, becau&s;e it is committed again&s;t an infinite being: thence it follows, that if one &s;in be an infinite evil, two &s;ins are dou|bly
<PB N="119" REF="026523_0136_0FD0860B867A0138">
infinite, and three, trebly infi|nite&mdash;which, at be&s;t, is egregious non&s;en&s;e, as infinity admits of no addition: and therefore, if any one &s;in be an infinite evil, it de&s;troys all degrees of compari&s;on between crimes, and renders the boy, who takes an apple out of his neigh|bour's orchard, as criminal as the Jews, who murdered the Saviour of the world. As there can be no difference, in degree, between things that are infinite; it is, there|fore, demon&s;trably evident. that no being, who is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of infi|nite power, can do or perform, any infinite action, either good or bad; therefore, the plea, in ju&s;tification of inflicting infinite puni&s;hments on human beings, to &s;atisfy divine ju&s;|tice, for the commi&s;&s;ion of crimes, &s;uppo&s;ed to be infinite&mdash;mu&s;t fall to the ground. A per&s;on would naturally conclude, on being told, that &s;inners were to be puni&s;hed in hell, to &s;atisfy divine ju&s;tice, that there might be a time, at &s;ome future period, when ju&s;tice might
<PB N="120" REF="026523_0137_0FD085E9112A41B0" MS="y">
be &s;atisfied, and the &s;inners relea&s;|ed: but they tell us, that ju&s;tice is vindictive; that is, &s;o <HI>revengeful, malicious</HI> and <HI>&s;piteful,</HI> that it never can be &s;atisfied: and therefore, in this undertaking, as in all the re&s;t, the means are &s;till inadequate to the end; and although good might have been intended, the final con|&s;equence is always evil. Yet the Calvini&s;ts tell us, it is by this inco|herent &s;y&s;tem of their own fabrica|tion, that the Deity is to di&s;play the <HI>glory</HI> of his divine attributes to all intelligent beings.</P>
<P>The chief objection which the calvini&s;ts oppo&s;e, to the doctrine of the univer&s;al re&s;toration, is, that it has a tendency to make people remi&s;s in making their calling and election &s;ure, in this life: in which ca&s;e, they may be eternally mi&s;era|ble hereafter&mdash;owing to their own neglect: but how incon&s;i&s;tent this objection is, with the doctrine of election and reprobation, any per|&s;on of common under&s;tanding may very ea&s;ily perceive. For a Cal|vini&s;t
<PB N="121" REF="026523_0138_0FD0860DF3C03AE0">
to admoni&s;h a reprobate, to work out his own &s;alvation, with fear and trembling; to make his calling and election &s;ure&mdash;and to make his peace with that God, who had con&s;igned him to endle&s;s perdition, by an unchangeable de|cree, many ages prior to his ex|i&s;tence; is, of all things, the mo&s;t ab&s;urd. But others being &s;hocked at the horrid imputation, that God &s;hould create human beings, having con&s;igned them to eternal puni&s;h|ment, by an unalterable decree, prior to a po&s;&s;ibility of their hav|ing offended him&mdash;deny that he de|creed their eternal mi&s;ery; but &s;till affirm that the Deity infalli|bly knew, that they would be &s;o, to the endle&s;s ages of eternity.&mdash;Whatever God infallibly foreknew, mu&s;t as certainly come to pa&s;s, as if he had decreed it: &s;o that this mi&s;erable <HI>&s;hift</HI> will neither <HI>vindicate</HI> the character of the Deity, from being guilty of an <HI>unprovoked act</HI> of <HI>cruelty,</HI> in creating beings, who had never <HI>offended</HI> him, infallibly
<PB N="122" REF="026523_0139_0FD085EA89E66898">
knowing that they would be eter|nally mi&s;erable: neither does it al|ter the fate of the poor unhappy creature.</P>
<P>For if God infallibly knew, that any individual would be eternally mi&s;erable; it is clearly impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould e&s;cape. And the conclu&s;ion, from the&s;e premi&s;es, mu&s;t be, that the Deity has dragged him into exi&s;tence, before he had <HI>offended,</HI> on purpo&s;e that he &s;hould be eternally damned: for it is ab|&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that God would &s;eriou&s;ly u&s;e any means to &s;ave a being, whom he infallibly knew would be eternally mi&s;erable. So that the unhappy creature is &s;up|po&s;ed to be de&s;erted by the God that made him; and abandoned to the entire conduct of the Devil. Therefore, if we admit that the De|ity is either ju&s;t or merciful, we mu&s;t, in con&s;equence, di&s;believe, that he ever either <HI>decreed</HI> or <HI>fore|knew,</HI> that any &s;oul, which he cre|ated, would be mi&s;ereble to the end|le&s;s ages of eternity, and believe

<P>Chri&s;t has been lifted up from the earth, fir&s;t on the cro&s;s, and then to heaven; and as I repo&s;e entire confidence in what Chri&s;t has promi&s;ed in &s;uch plain terms;

I &s;incerely believe, that he will finally draw <HI>all men</HI> unto him; even tho&s;e who have made it the bu&s;ine&s;s of their whole lives; to traduce his moral character: for if he forgave the Jews who murder|ed him, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. xi. 26.</NOTE> he will doubtle&s;s pray for his defamers, &s;aying "Father for|give them: for they know not what they do." "And &s;o all I&s;ra|el &s;hall be &s;aved; as it is written, there &s;hall come out of Sion, the deliverer, and turn away ungodli|ne&s;s from Jacob."</P>
