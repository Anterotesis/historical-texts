<P>_SOMETIME in <HI>June,</HI> 1787, Doctor SAMU|EL BRAKE, a gentle|man eminent both for phi&s;ick and &s;urgery, and a man indefatigable in the &s;earch of curio&s;ities, hearing of the wonderful account of the HERMIT, &s;et out with a full determination to go and find him. The Doctor furni&s;hed him&s;elf with the be&s;t intelligence Capt. <HI>Buckland</HI> could po&s;&s;ibly give him, and took with him two attendants well armed, and as much provi&s;ion as was nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch a journey, and being favoured with good weather, they &s;oon came to the Allega|ny mountains:&mdash;Here the Doctor di&s;|covered a certain root never known nor heard of before, which proves a remedy for all di&s;ea&s;es.&mdash;After a great deal of trouble they found the HERMIT, but it was entirely by accident that they hap|pened at la&s;t to di&s;cover him; for the country was very wild, covered with &s;hrubs as thick as po&s;&s;ible, and the trees grew large beyond de&s;cription.&mdash;One day the Doctor di&s;covered with his &s;py-gla&s;s, a very high hill at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance; and thought he would go and take an ob&s;ervation from the top of that hill; when he arrived there, he &s;oon found the old HERMIT's path, ju&s;t as Capt. <HI>Buckland</HI> had directed.&mdash;They followed the path down the valley, and &s;oon came to the HERMIT's cave;&mdash; nothing was &s;een of the HERMIT for &s;ometime, and they &s;uppo&s;ed he was a|&s;leep in his cave, and not one &s;oul dur&s;t venture into his old habitation; at length, whil&s;t they were li&s;tening at the mouth of the cave, they di&s;covered the HERMIT at a little di&s;tance, coming with a handful of roots which he had been gathering for food;&mdash;he walked in a &s;low and grave manner, and when he &s;aw them he came and embraced them;&mdash;but did not &s;eem to be &s;o much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee them as he was when fir&s;t di&s;covered by Capt. <HI>Buckland,</HI> &amp;c. &mdash;He invited them in a very friendly manner into his cave, and was overjoy|ed to &s;ee them. The cave was very curious, which appeared to be dug out of a &s;olid white flint rock: But as a particular de&s;cription has been given of it, it will be needle&s;s to &s;ay any thing further concerning it.&mdash;The HERMIT made particular enquiry after Capt. <HI>Buckland</HI> and Mr. <HI>Fielding,</HI> and &s;aid that he received great &s;atisfaction from a vi&s;it which they had made him, and added, that they were the fir&s;t human beings that he had &s;een from the time that he fir&s;t landed on this &s;hore, which was about TWO HUNDRED YEARS. Dr. <HI>Brake</HI> tarried there &s;everal days, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> became very intimate with the HERMIT, and found &s;evearl things which were not di&s;covered be|fore:&mdash;Two books in particular, which he brought with him from England, one in poetry, the other in pro&s;e.&mdash;The HERMIT appeared to have had a good education when he was young, and di&s;covered a &s;urpri&s;|ing greatne&s;s of mind. His eyes were good, but his teeth were very poor, he had but little hair on his head, but his beard was very long. He could not articulate his words ve|ry di&s;tinctly, but his language was better than any &s;poken in England at the time he left it, which makes it appear evident that he was an extra|ordinary genius when he was young. He &s;hewed Doctor <HI>Brake</HI> his books, writings, &amp;c. of which he had a large pile in one corner of his cave, &s;ome were done <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> barks of trees, and &s;ome o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> made into a kind of parchment. The Doctor obtained liberty to take a copy of the HER|MIT's compo&s;itions. One contain|ed principally moral &s;entiments, and the following &s;entences were found written in one of them:&mdash;"Young men and young women, beware of &s;educing appearances which may &s;urround you and recollect what others have &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">red from the power of head&s;trong de&s;ire.&mdash;This world is but a wilderne&s;s&mdash;eager pa&s;&s;ions and violent de&s;ires were not made for man.&mdash;Pitch upon that cour&s;e of life which is be&s;t, and habit will ren|der it mo&s;t delightful."</P>
<P>After a while the Doctor deter|mined to try the HERMIT with a little rum, and &s;ee what the effect would be; but it was with great dif|ficulty that he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">uld per&s;uade him to drink: The Doctor &s;aid that it was an excellent cordial that tended to &s;trengthen the con&s;titution, and at la&s;t the poor innocent HERMIT was per&s;uaded to drink a little of that horrid bane, which hath &s;ent thou|&s;ands out of the world.&mdash;He drank about three quarters of a gill of that poi&s;on liquor, and in a quarter of an hour there was a vi&s;ible alteration in his looks and conduct; and in half an hour he appeared wild and almo&s;t mad, and attempted to tell a kind of a love &s;tory; and in about an hour he was entirely &s;en&s;ele&s;s, and re|mained in that &s;hocking &s;ituation until 12 o'clock at night and then died.</P>
<P>Poor old man! he lived about two hundred years in his cave, free from the bu&s;y &s;cenes of the world, and enjoying all the happine&s;s of a retired life! And might perhaps have lived as many more, had he not drank that horrid draught! Cur&s;ed liquor! Thou&s;ands have fell a &s;acrifice to its bewitching power.</P>
<P>Among the HERMIT's writings was found his WILL, which appear|ed to have been made &s;oon after he was di&s;covered.&mdash;He had given his cave to Capt. <HI>Buckland</HI> and Mr. <HI>Field|ing,</HI> as al&s;o all his writings: His cu|rious cane he willed to one of Capt. <HI>Buckland's</HI> &s;ervants, which was all the HERMIT was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, ex|cepting a few old &s;kins which had &s;erved to clothe him, tho&s;e he gave to the other &s;ervant, as a reward for his kindne&s;s in &s;inging a love &s;ong to him before they departed.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Brake</HI> was much affected at the &s;udden death of the HERMIT, more e&s;pecially the manner in which he was brought to his untimely death&mdash;but the Doctor &s;aid he felt no remor&s;e of con&s;cience, as he real|ly &s;uppo&s;ed that a little of that cor|dial would &s;erve to rai&s;e his &s;pirits, and make him more cheerful with his new vi&s;itors.</P>
<P>The next day the Doctor and his attendants employed them&s;elves a|bout burying the old gentlemen in as decent a manner as po&s;&s;ible in his cave, which was done with great &s;o|lemnity and good order.&mdash;The Doc|tor ordered one of his attendants to &s;have the HERMIT, and his beard is carefully pre&s;erved as a very great curio&s;ity, it being at lea&s;t twelve inches long.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Doctor <HI>Brake</HI> mentions that this good old man made it his con&s;tant cu&s;tom to devote him&s;elf to prayer every day, and there is no doubt of his everla&s;ting happine&s;s.</P>
