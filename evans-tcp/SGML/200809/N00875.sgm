<HEAD>A <HI>LETTER</HI> from a Clergy-man in the Country, To a Clergy-man in the City, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE long Knowledge I have had of your Wi&s;dom, Temper and Moderation (for which I can truly &s;ay, without the lea&s;t Umbrage of Flattery, you de&s;erve to be highly valued) hath given me Encouragement to Communicate to you, my free and impartial Thoughts, concerning the Controver&s;ie, between &s;ome of our <HI>Brethren</HI> on the one hand, and the <HI>Quakers</HI> on the other. Tho' I am a great Admirer of Solitude and Retirement, being &s;eldom &s;een in the Crowds of the Talkative and Unthinking Multitude, but &s;eque&s;tring my &s;elf, as much as I can po&s;&s;ibly, from publick Noi&s;e, that I might have the more Opportunity to Introvert my Mind, and Wait upon, and adore my Creator; for when my Mind is <HI>Silent</HI> and <HI>Retired,</HI> and my own Imaginations and Rea&s;onings are &s;hut out; then I can hear his <HI>Still</HI> and <HI>Small Voice,</HI> and have an in|ward &s;en&s;ible Perception of his Divine Pre&s;ence with my Soul: Yet I am not &s;uch an ab&s;olute <HI>Reclu&s;e,</HI> as to Cloy&s;ter my &s;elf wholly up from the Things of this World; for I admit of Vi&s;its from particular Friends, read Books at &s;ea&s;onable Intervals, and hold Epi&s;tolary Corre&s;pondence with Your &s;elf, and a few more <HI>Select Per&s;ons,</HI> who know the worth of <HI>Privacy,</HI> by the <HI>Benefit</HI> they Enjoy in it. So that tho' I am no Actor in the publick Theatre of the Times, yet I never have been, nor am an ignorant and unconcerned Spectator of tho&s;e Tran&s;actions, that have happened in our Day.</P>
<P>And of all Occurences; the <HI>Di&s;&s;entions about Religion,</HI> and tho&s;e often attended with violent He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts and Reflections, by Men of &s;e|rious and intemperate Spirits, have mo&s;t affected me. All profe&s;s them&s;elves to be Chri&s;tians, to be Di&s;ciples and Followers of Chri&s;t, and yet, how few <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mitate him whom they pretend to be their Ma&s;ter? And 'tis a &s;ad, but a true Ob&s;ervation, that they who have the wor&s;t Cau&s;e, and weake&s;t Arguments, are very apt to give Hard Names, and to Revile and Slander their Opponents; that &s;ince they cannot Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> them by Dint of fair Ratiocination, they might, if po&s;&s;ible, Pollute them with the Dirt of filthy Reflection.
<PB N="4" REF="001055_0003_0FAEF36F85134930">
You know who&s;e Practice this has been in their former Quarrels, with other <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI>; and now, in a more particular manner, with the <HI>Quakers,</HI> e&s;pecially &s;ince Mr. <HI>Bugg</HI> and Mr. <HI>Keith</HI> came among&s;t us; Per&s;ons who were not &s;o much <HI>De&s;erters,</HI> as <HI>Ca&s;hired</HI> Men, for their Immoralities; for they did not <HI>Come,</HI> but were <HI>Thru&s;t out</HI> from among&s;t the <HI>Quakers</HI>; at which taking deep Re&s;entment, and cheri&s;hing that bad Humour in them&s;elves, which cau&s;ed their <HI>Expul&s;ion,</HI> their whole Ma&s;s &s;eems to be &s;o corrupted, that their En|mity is become Implacable again&s;t that <HI>People.</HI></P>
<P>And as it is natural for Malignant Humours to &s;pread, e&s;pecially over tho&s;e Parts which were before Infected; &s;o the&s;e Men, coming full among&s;t us, of Envy, Hatred and Malice, have infu&s;ed their Wenom, into &s;ome of our <HI>Brethren,</HI> who had formerly been Tainted, and tho&s;e, having received the Infection them&s;elves, how Indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly do they endeavour to &s;pread it among others.</P>
<P>I am heartily &s;orry to &s;ee it; but what Pains do they take? Yea what Artifices do they u&s;e, to po&s;&s;e&s;s not only private Per&s;ons with Prejudice, but al&s;o to &s;tir up Per&s;ecution in the Government again&s;t the <HI>Quakers,</HI> as tho' they were not fit to live among&s;t us? The Pul|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts Ring with Invectives, and the Pre&s;&s;es Groan with Abu&s;ive Books and Pamphlets again&s;t them. The common Charge is, <HI>That they are Guilty of Bla&s;phemy again&s;t God, Chri&s;t, and the Holy Scriptures</HI>; thus our <HI>Norfolk</HI>-Brethren: Yea, of <HI>Bla&s;phemy and Here&s;ie</HI>; &s;o Mr. <HI>Keith.</HI> But the <HI>Quakers</HI> have An&s;wered tho&s;e Charges again and again, and Cleared them&s;elves in the Face of God and the World, as appears by their Printed Books and Papers. To be plain; Let any indifferent Man compare their Books with ours, and he will &s;oon &s;ee, to whom the Bla&s;phemy and Here&s;ie belong.</P>
<P>You may remember, Sir, what you gave me in your la&s;t, as your Opi|nion about the Cau&s;e of our <HI>Brethrens</HI> Out cry again&s;t the Quakers, rather than other <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> viz. <HI>Their Oppo&s;ition to Tithes,</HI> which the other generally pay? and your &s;en&s;e was, That if the <HI>Quakers</HI> would comply in that One Thing, the N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of <HI>Bla&s;phemy and Here|&s;ie</HI> would be no more heard again&s;t them: And I am inclined to be|lieve it, becau&s;e you know, that <HI>Tithes are the very Pil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ars of out Church</HI>; take away them, and the Sumptuous Fabrick quickly fals into a Heap of Rubbi&s;h: We cannot Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t without them, we can not Furn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">h our Libraries, not Maintain our Families, without them. 'Tis granted, they are not due to <HI>Us</HI> by Vertue of the <HI>Divine Law,</HI> as they were to the <HI>Levites</HI>; but they are &s;ettled upon us by the <HI>Law of the Land</HI>; and &s;o we Claim them, and &s;o we Receive them, and upon no other Foot of Account.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="001055_0004_0FAEF371B99F8A88">The <HI>Quakers</HI> have &s;aid &s;o much again&s;t our old Plea, of <HI>Divine Right,</HI> and made it out &s;o fully, and plainly by <HI>Scripture,</HI> that none but &s;ome <HI>Zealous Novices,</HI> or <HI>Super annuated bigots,</HI> will now of|fer to u&s;e it; and therefore the <HI>Wi&s;e</HI> among us have quitted that Pre|tence, and do in&s;i&s;t only upon a <HI>Right</HI> i&s;&s;uing from <HI>meer</HI> Humane Con|&s;titution.</P>
<P>I have diligently looked into the Controver&s;ie, that is between our <HI>Brethren</HI> and the <HI>Quakers,</HI> not with a Partial or Captious, but with a Single and Indifferent Eye; and I do not find, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> are either Guilty of tho&s;e Real Errors that are laid to their Charge; or, that tho&s;e which our <HI>Brethren</HI> &s;uppo&s;e to be Errors, in them, are Er|rors at all; but are rather Glorious Go&s;pel Truths. I will give &s;ome In&s;tances in both.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The <HI>Quakers</HI> are charged, with <HI>Denying the Man Chri&s;t Je|&s;us</HI>; which were a great Error indeed, were they Guilty of it: but they &s;ufficiently Acquit them&s;elves of this, by confe&s;&s;ing expre&s;ly to his <HI>Manhood; That he was Conceived by the Holy Gho&s;t, born of the Virgin</HI> Mary, <HI>Suffered under</HI> Pontius Pilate, <HI>was Crucified, Dead and Baried, Ro&s;e again the third Day, and A&s;cended into Heaven:</HI> So that this Charge is very untruly brought again&s;t them. G. <HI>Fox</HI>'s <HI>Journal,</HI> p. 358.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> They are charged, with <HI>Denying the Re&s;urrection of the Body:</HI> But this al&s;o is another fal&s;e Imputation; for they believe the <HI>Re&s;ur|rection</HI> according to Scripture, the one, <HI>from Sin</HI>; the other, <HI>from Death and the Grave, W. Penn</HI>'s <HI>Key,</HI> &amp;c. Perver&s;ion 15. Yea, <HI>That the Dead &s;hall be Rai&s;ed with the</HI> SAME BODIES, <HI>as far as a Natur|al, and Incorruptible, Terre&s;trial, and Cele&s;tial, can be the</HI> SAME, Truths Principles <HI>by</HI> J. Crook, <HI>printed</HI> Anno 1663.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> They are charged, with <HI>Denying the Trinity:</HI> But the con|trary is manife&s;t by their Writings; for they believe in the <HI>Holy Three,</HI> or <HI>Trinity</HI> of <HI>Father, Word</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> 1 <HI>John</HI> 5.7. And that the&s;e <HI>Three</HI> are truly and properly <HI>One,</HI> of <HI>One Nature,</HI> as well as <HI>Will. W. Penn</HI>'s <HI>Key,</HI> &amp;c. Perver&s;ion 9. <HI>In the Unity of the God head,</HI> &s;aith <HI>G. Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tehead, there is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t; and that tho&s;e Three are One, of One, Sub&s;tance, Power and Eternity.</HI> Truth and Innocency Vindicated, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> p. 52. See al&s;o <HI>Anguis Flagelea|tus,</HI> by <HI>Jo&s;eph Wyeth.</HI> p. 184.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly,</HI> Another Charge again&s;t them is, that, <HI>They Deny the Scriptu|res</HI>; than which, nothing can be Fal&s;er: For they have always Te&s;ti|fied, as <HI>J. Wyeth</HI> declares, to the 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.16 <HI>That all Scripture is given by In&s;piration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Re|proof, for Correction, for In&s;truction in Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Ibid. p. 150.
<PB N="6" REF="001055_0005_0FAEF372A4AFDC68">
See al&s;o, <HI>The Defence of the People called Quakers,</HI> &amp;c. p. 15. The like may be &s;aid of &s;everal other Things, which are real Errors, where ever they are met with, as well as tho&s;e before mentioned; but they are untruly charged upon the <HI>Quakers</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it evidently appears by their Writings.</P>
<P>Again, there are &s;ome other Things, which our <HI>Brethren</HI> &s;uppo|&s;ing to be Errors in the <HI>Quakers,</HI> have charged upon them, as &s;uch, which yet are found to be Glorious Go&s;pel Truths.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Our <HI>Brethren</HI> &s;uppo&s;e that the <HI>Quakers</HI> are in an Error about the LIGHT WITHIN; and thereupon have be&s;towed upon it many Opprobrious, not to &s;ay, Bla&s;phemous Names; as, <HI>Ignis hotuus, A Diabolical Light,</HI> &amp;c. So &s;ome: And others, <HI>A Spark from the De|vil's Forge</HI>; So our <HI>Norfolk</HI> Brethren (to wit) Doctor <HI>Beckham,</HI> Mr. <HI>Meriton,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Topcliffe,</HI> in their <HI>Principles of the Quakers,</HI> &amp;c. p. 6. <HI>A Whim&s;ical Witne&s;s fetch'd from</HI> Terra Incognita, p. 57. <HI>A Counterfeit Phanta&s;m,</HI> p. 74. <HI>The Phanta&s;m of a Chri&s;t within,</HI> p. 86. <HI>ibid.</HI> Another calls it, <HI>A Mon&s;trous Notion</HI>; and Affirms it to be <HI>the Ground and Foundation of all their other Errors and Bla&s;phemies</HI>: So the Author of <HI>The Snake in the Gra&s;s,</HI> 3d Edition, p. 8. But I have faithfully Examin'd the <HI>Quakers</HI> Notion about the LIGHT WITHIN, and compar'd it with the Scriptures, and do find, that they &s;peak of it as the Scriptures do (<HI>v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">z.</HI>) That <HI>Chri&s;t is the</HI> LIGHT <HI>of the World</HI>; and that he doth <HI>Enlighten every Man that cometh into it,</HI> with DI|VINE SAVING LIGHT. I am &s;orry our <HI>Brethren</HI> &s;hould be &s;o <HI>Dark,</HI> as to oppo&s;e it.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> Our <HI>Brethren</HI> Charge <HI>Immediate Revelation</HI> upon them, as an|other great Error; which is not an Error, but a Glorious Go&s;pel Truth: for, if <HI>Immediate Revelation</HI> were Cea&s;ed, as our <HI>Brethren</HI> &s;ay, there could be no &s;uch Thing, as the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion</HI> in the World; for there is no Saving Knowledge of the Father and the Son Attainable without it. I have the Te&s;timony of Chri&s;t him&s;elf, for what I &s;ay, and therefore am bold to A&s;&s;ert it. <HI>No Man knoweth the Son, but the Father; Neither knoweth any Man the Father &s;ave the Son, and he to whom&s;oever the Son will Reveal him,</HI> Mat. 11.27. Take away <HI>Imme|diate Revelation,</HI> and farewell to the Chri&s;tian Religion; a <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Notion</HI> of Chri&s;tianity may be kept up, but the <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it.
<Q>The <HI>Quakers</HI> do not plead for any <HI>New Go&s;pel, Faith,</HI> or <HI>Doctrine,</HI> different from that which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his <HI>Holy A|po&s;tles</HI> and <HI>Prophets</HI> Taught, and is recorded in the Scriptures of Truth: but for the Revelation of that, which they Taught, &amp; is there in Recorded. <BIBL><HI>Defence of the People called Quakers,</HI> p. 6.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> Our <HI>Brethren</HI> Charge it as an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> upon the <HI>Quakers,</HI> for
<PB N="7" REF="001055_0006_0FAEF37401937140">
A&s;&s;erting the <HI>Sufficiency of the</HI> LIGHT WITHIN <HI>to Salvation, without the Scriptures</HI>: But this is no Error in the <HI>Quakers</HI> Sence; for I per|ceive by their Writings, that they do not oppo&s;e the LIGHT WITH|IN to the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> nor do they exclude the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> where they are afforded unto Men: but by the LIGHT WITHIN, they under|&s;tanding Chri&s;t, who &s;aid, <HI>I am the</HI> LIGHT <HI>of the World,</HI> John 9.5.

Therefore, un|le&s;s our <HI>Brethren</HI> will deny the All-&s;ufficiency of Chri&s;t, or exclude all tho&s;e the Pale of divine Mercy, who know not the Scriptures (which is both contrary to <HI>Scripture,</HI> and to the repeated Te&s;timony of God's Goodne&s;s Recorded therein) I cannot &s;ee what Pretence they can make for Oppugning this A&s;&s;ertion of the <HI>Quakers.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly,</HI> Another Truth held by this <HI>People,</HI> and mi&s;-called Error by our <HI>Brethren</HI> is, <HI>Sinle&s;s Perfection on this Side the Grave:</HI> But if &s;uch a State is not attainable in this Life, to what end are there &s;o many <HI>Precepts</HI> about it, &s;o many <HI>Exhortations</HI> to it, &s;o many <HI>Prayers</HI> for it, and &s;o many <HI>Examples</HI> of it recorded in the <HI>Scripture?</HI> Why do we pray in the <HI>Te Deum, Vouch&s;afe, O Lord, to keep us this day</HI> without Sin?
