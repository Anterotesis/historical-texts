<P>IN the cour&s;e of the Author's itinerant Preaching, as a Candidate, the following Sermon was delivered &s;everal times both in Connecticut and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts; and as often had the good Fortune to plea&s;e &s;ome; and &s;ome of his Friends thinking that the Sermon might be profitable; de&s;ired to &s;ee it in Print: the author ever willing to gratify his Frinds in things lawful, <HI>con&s;ented;</HI> which is the only rea&s;on he gives for troubling the <HI>Publick.</HI></P>
<P>If it &s;hould fall into any other hands, than tho&s;e for whom it is more immediately publi&s;hed; they are adverti&s;ed, that they will find &s;omething old, and &s;omething new; out of the common road of thinking; yet the Author thinks it agreeable to the Go&s;pel plan, and the de&s;ign of his text; and that it may be profita|ble if read with care and de&s;ign of getting good, otherwi&s;e it had better be let alone.</P>
<P>As he had no regard either of fear or deffer|ence towards Criticks; they may probably, find enough for the exerci&s;e of their Spleen; and hereby have full Liberty to vent the whole <HI>Quantum</HI> of Critici&s;m.</P>
<P>That the following Sermon may be to the Glory of GOD, and good of Man; through the advancement of the Redeemers kingdom; awak|ing the &s;ecure leading the faithful inqui&s;itor, and comforting the Saint, is the &s;incere Prayer of their Humble Servant,</P>

<P>HEAR, O Heavens; give ear O Earth, be a&s;toni&s;hed, O our Souls! <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> the Lord of life and glory; <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> the Lamb of God; <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> the &s;on of the Highe&s;t, not only gave him&s;elf to the accur&s;ed death of the Cro&s;s, to &s;ave a peri&s;hing, hell-de&s;erving world; but <HI>Living,</HI> conde&s;cends to offer; nay intreat for a reconciliation. <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> is come, he calls; he knocks at the door of our hearts for admittance; for <HI>liberty</HI> of forming him|&s;elf in, and communing with our &s;ouls; Awake from the Death-begotten dream; Awake from the&s;e carnal &s;lumbers; why thus deaf, when the beloved <HI>Je&s;us</HI> calls? Why thus luke-warm in his &s;ervice? Why thus aver&s;e; thus <HI>inattentive</HI> to his affectio|nate cries?</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="015745_0004_0FA51CF3D4037D48">Lift up O our Souls, and be lifted up ye doors of our hearts, that the King of Glory may come in: He now invites us to a union and fellow&s;hip with him&s;elf; to a par|ticipation of the joys of the New-Jeru&s;alem, the city of God: O, the infinite goodne&s;s, the unfathomable love, the &s;tupendious grace of a <HI>cru&s;ified Je&s;us</HI>!</P>
<P>Ye carele&s;s and profane; may I engage <HI>your</HI> attention to this Grace? will ye hear this language of divinity? will ye li&s;ten to the heavenly voice of your <HI>Friend</HI>? The&s;e are his words, O, Sinner, "I know thyworks, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot, &s;o then, becau&s;e thou art luke-warm, and neither cold nor hot, I will &s;pue thee out of my Mouth: Becau&s;e thou &s;aye&s;t, I am rich, and increa&s;ed in goods and have need of nothing; and knowe&s;t not that thou art wretched, and mi&s;erable, and blind and naked." Yet, this is a &s;trange work to me: I e&s;teem your happine&s;s far more elegible; why wilt thou not accept of peace and righteou&s;ne&s;s at my hands? "I coun|cil thee to buy of me gold, tried in the fire, that thou maye&s;t be rich; and white rai|ment that thou maye&s;t be cloathed, and that the &s;hame of thy nakedne&s;s do not appear; and anoint thy eyes, with eye &s;alve, that
<PB N="5" REF="015745_0005_0FA51CF491747D98">
thou maye&s;t &s;ee. As many as I love I rebuke and cha&s;ten; be zealous therefore and re|pent."</P>
<P>And to induce you, to accept of my coun|&s;el, and that I may leave you without any &s;how of excu&s;e for refu&s;al, I further a&s;&s;ure you that according to the will and appointment of the father, I &s;hall readily a&s;&s;i&s;t you by my &s;pirit through the go&s;pel; while you zea|lou&s;ly attend thereto; and carefully improve the grace and talents given; and will bring you home to my&s;elf, unle&s;s your ob&s;tinacy prevent. "Behold," (attend to my words, and rely on my varacity) "I &s;tand at the door and knock; if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will &s;up with him and he with me."</P>
<P>Such is the Covenant of Grace, and the ap|pointment of Heaven; that, who&s;oever &s;hall hear and open to me; <HI>he</HI> &s;hall obtain the "gold tried in the fire; the white raiment, and the eye-&s;alve;" and I will love him.</P>
<P><HI>This,</HI> O &s;inner, is the unfathomable love of God, this, is the voice of a once <HI>cru&s;ified Je&s;us</HI> unto thee, if you hear, it is life; if you refu&s;e, it is death to thy Soul forever.</P>
<P>But, let us more particularly, enquire how Chri&s;t helps us to come to him; or what is implied in his &s;tanding and knocking at the
<PB N="6" REF="015745_0006_0FA51CF5798D3B08">
door; what may be implied in our hearing his voice, and opening the door to him; what in his coming into our hearts, and our &s;upping together.</P>
<P>Fir&s;tly. What is Chri&s;t doing on his part to bring us to a &s;tate of reconciliation: Or, what &s;hall we under&s;tand by his &s;tanding and knocking at the door?</P>
<P>Omiting &s;everal niceties, and minute ex|planations on the&s;e terms, <HI>Behold, Standing, Knocking, Door,</HI> &amp;c. (on which &s;ome have &s;pent much Labour) I &s;hall only ob&s;erve in general, that we under&s;tand hereby that Chri&s;t in the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation, its Ordi|nances and in&s;titutions, continualy &s;eeks and endeavours to make impre&s;&s;ions on the hearts of Sinners, that, he may bring them to a &s;en&s;e of duty, and bow their &s;tubborn wills to his own &s;overeign plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Hence, we are naturally led to ob&s;erve, that Chri&s;t makes the fir&s;t advance towards the Sinner for Reconciliation and Peace: "<HI>Behold</HI> (&s;ays Chri&s;t) <HI>I &s;tand at the door.</HI>" Though we are the offending party, and as &s;uch, ought to make the fir&s;t &s;uit for recon|ciliation; yet Chri&s;t knowing our infirmity, is plea&s;ed to magnify his Grace towards us, by making the fir&s;t offers: and thus prove him&s;elf the be&s;t of friends unto us, though
<PB N="7" REF="015745_0007_0FA51CF61682B200">
we are the wor&s;t of enemies to him: This is of the Lords mercies, and marvelous in our eyes; it is an in&s;tance of the unparralleled love of Chri&s;t to our ruined Race, and ardent de&s;ire to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t. Did Je|&s;us wait for us to make the fir&s;t advance to|wards reconciliation, eternal death would be inevitable. Our corrupt nature could never lead us unto God: Our fall from Rectitude is &s;piritual death in the &s;oul; that we can put forth no holy exerci&s;e untill Chri&s;t quicken us from dead works, to &s;erve the living God, we are by nature enemies to the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, "<HI>For the carnal mind is enmity again&s;t God:</HI>" How then can we a&s;k for re|conciliation? while thus aver&s;e to the cro&s;s, how &s;hall we bow to the Scepter of Je&s;us, and come to his foot&s;tool for mercy? <HI>impo&s;&s;i|ble,</HI> Je&s;us, and he only, can lead man to this.</P>
<P>Again, Je&s;us comes near to invite us: He don't &s;tand aloft, or at a di&s;tance when he calls; no, but he comes to the very thre&s;hold of the heart, he touches it with his power; behold I &s;tand <HI>at the door,</HI> and <HI>knock</HI>: Chri&s;t by his word and &s;pirit comes to the heart of every &s;inner under the go&s;pel, and the &s;inner knows him to be there, pleading for admit|tance; &s;ometimes in a way of mercies, at others, in a way of afflictions, we can't plead
<PB N="8" REF="015745_0008_0FA51CFB01C5EF08">
that we never had an opportunity to make our peace with Chri&s;t; Je&s;us has come, he has come <HI>near</HI> even to the very door of our hearts, and knocked for admittance, that if we peri&s;h, we mu&s;t peri&s;h with blood on our heads. But,</P>
<P>Furthermore; Je&s;us by &s;tanding and knocking at the door of our hearts, mani|fe&s;ts both a willingne&s;s and ardent de&s;ire to en|ter in and &s;et up his throne there. As we mani|fe&s;t an intent to enter our neighbour's hou&s;e by knocking at his door, &s;o does Chri&s;t by knocking at the door of our hearts. The &s;i|militude is ea&s;y and familiar, emblematical of intimacy and friend&s;hip: Such is the will of Chri&s;t here exhibited: He would be familiar: He would be at home in all our hearts: He wi&s;hes to make us all partakers of his own felicity and will effect it, if we will &s;uf|fer him to fit us for &s;uch heavenly enjoy|ments.</P>
<P><HI>This</HI> is the tenor of the Go&s;pel; from <HI>This,</HI> flow all the kind invitations of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; &s;ee his de&s;ire to the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, "<HI>Turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye die, O hou&s;e of I&s;|rael; for as I live faith the Lord, I have no plea&s;ure in the death of the wicked; but that he turn from his evil way and live.</HI>" It is by our own <HI>will,</HI> not God's that we peri&s;h; he
<PB N="9" REF="015745_0009_0FA51CFD362FDB50">
accounts it his &s;trange work to execute wrath, he would fain withhold the &s;word of his ven|geance that mercy might take the lead, though he be highly provoked; though he has made bare his arm and brandi&s;hed his &s;word; yet through the pleading of mercy, and his ar|dent de&s;ire after our happine&s;s, he will &s;tay his hand for a &s;ea&s;on: An in&s;tance of this prerogative of deity towards the hou&s;e of I&s;|rael&punc; we have mo&s;t excellently de&s;cribed by the Prophet Ho&s;ea, Ch. XI. 8, 9. <HI>How &s;hall I give thee up Ephraim? How &s;hall I deliver thee I&s;rael? How &s;hall I make thee as Ad<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">|ah? How &s;hall I &s;et thee as Zeboim? Mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together. I will not execute the fiercene&s;s of mine anger, I will not return to de&s;troy Ephraim,</HI> for I am God, <HI>and not man.</HI>" Chri&s;t is not only willing to &s;ave; but loath to de&s;troy; it is the de&s;ire of his &s;oul to communicate of happine&s;s to his creatures, it is infinitely more elegible to him, to glorify him&s;elf in our &s;al|vation; than in our damnation.</P>
<P>But yet further, though we are aver&s;e to the cro&s;s; yet the matchle&s;s Je&s;us, not only de&s;ires our &s;alvation, but is u&s;ing means for our conver&s;ion: Behold (&s;ays he) I &s;tand at the door and <HI>knock.</HI> Chri&s;t now that he is come, is neither idle nor &s;ilent; but he knocks
<PB N="10" REF="015745_0010_0FA51CFD93259C80" MS="y">
at the door of our hearts; he accu&s;es the &s;lumbering &s;oul, and brings home convictions to the con&s;cience. Many are the means of his grace, and divers the methods of his operati|ons; but he leaves none without a call; nay, repeated calls both of his go&s;pel, his mini|&s;ters, his providences and his holy &s;pirit. This work, he generally begins in the days of our youth, while the mind is flexile and the con|&s;cience tender; he takes this opportunity, as the faire&s;t, to engage our thoughts on the things of religion; his calls are the calls of mercy, and invitations of his grace; the Spirit moves gently on the heart, revealing the truths of the go&s;pel: endeavouring to take our affec|tions from youthful lu&s;ts and vanities, and &s;et them "<HI>on things above, where Chri&s;t is at the right hand of GOD.</HI>"</P>
<P>But if the&s;e calls are not heard, he will cha&s;ti&s;e us; neither our encrea&s;ing in years, nor ingratitude under mercies, can &s;tay his paren|tal rebuke: Je&s;us will verily come and knock harder at the door; he will come with the rod of correction, and teach us the in&s;tabili|ty of human devices, and the uncertainty of temporal enjoyments.</P>
<P>Are we &s;till ungrateful under mercies, and incorrigible under cha&s;ti&s;ements, he will knock louder at the door; he will be heard
<PB N="11" REF="015745_0011_0FA51D0089FE3E28">
and under&s;tood before he departs: Judgments grow &s;evere and &s;mite on every &s;ide: The &s;pirit &s;ets home convictions on the con&s;cience with fearful energy, and the terrors of the Lord &s;ound dreadful in our ears, till we hear as it were, the thundering and &s;ee the light|ning from Mount Sinai, flu&s;hing immediate vengeance from the Almighty. Here let us &s;ee and admire the love of God to our hell-de&s;erving race: Is it not boundle&s;s unfathoma|ble love? Why did <HI>Je&s;us</HI> bleed for &s;uch re|bels? Nay, why does he &s;trive with &s;uch un|grateful wretches, who always re&s;i&s;t his &s;pi|rit? Why does he u&s;e &s;uch means, and work thus variou&s;ly to &s;pare <HI>us</HI> from de&s;erved ruin? Why does he not rather ari&s;e in wrath, to avenge abu&s;ed grace, and with his uplifted arm hurl the whole race down to irremida|ble woe? He is <HI>God!</HI> He is <HI>God,</HI> not man.</P>
<P>Yet my friends, notwith&s;tanding all this goodne&s;s and grace of the beloved Je&s;us, is it not a lamentable truth, that the greater part of us have not regarded the&s;e kind calls, &s;o as to open the door unto Chri&s;t; but from our awaknings have turned, like the dog to his vomit; and the &s;ow that was wa&s;hed to her wallowing in the mire?</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve but this once more; Behold (&s;ays Chri&s;t) I <HI>&s;tand</HI> at the door: here is the for|bearance
<PB N="12" REF="015745_0012_0FA51D02028C4478">
and long &s;ufferance of God manife&s;t; the calls of Chri&s;t are not ha&s;ty and flighty; he does not call and pa&s;s right on; but <HI>&s;tands at the door,</HI> he waits for our an&s;wer; when he offers peace and reconciliation, he expects our an&s;wer, whether we accept or not; nay, he does not leave us at the fir&s;t refu&s;al; but &s;till forbears; how many days, months and years has he waited on us? How often been refu&s;ed? Yet this day we have the offers of life and &s;alvation &s;ounding in our ears; we are witne&s;&s;es for Chri&s;t that he is long-&s;uffering and gracious. Let us take heed le&s;t we tire his patience. He &s;ays he will not always &s;trive with man; if his vi&s;its are le&s;s frequent do we feel more carele&s;s and indifferent, de|pend on it, that it is time to awake, and cry mightily unto God for his returns, le&s;t he de|part for ever; perhaps this is the la&s;t offer; now then is the time, or never; this lo&s;t, Hell is certain.</P>
<P>We have no excu&s;e to make; but are mur|derers of our own &s;ouls; Chri&s;t is free and his throne will be forever guiltle&s;s: (Speaking after the manner of men) he departs with an acking heart and weeping eyes: Shall we &s;ee his &s;orrow; &s;hall we hear his lamentation? "<HI>O Jeru&s;alem, Jeru&s;alem, which kille&s;t the Prophets, and &s;tone&s;t them that are &s;ent unto
<PB N="13" REF="015745_0013_0FA51D021029D910" MS="y">
thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings and ye would not?</HI>" O ye carele&s;s and hard-hearted &s;inners how of|ten have I knocked at the door of your hearts, how often called you by my word and &s;pirit, that you would for&s;ake the fooli&s;h and live? How have I &s;trove to deliver you from Hell? But ye would not be delivered.</P>
<P>Thus we briefly &s;ee what Chri&s;t is doing to engage us to accept of his council, or what is implied in his &s;tanding and knocking at the door.</P>
<P>Let us now &s;ee what is required on the &s;inner's part in return; Or,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> &s;hew what is implied in our hear|ing the voice, and opening the door unto Chri&s;t; If any man hear my voice, and open the door (&s;ays Chri&s;t) I will come in to him, &amp;c. might I enlarge, it would be well to note &s;omething on the univer&s;ality of this call, "<HI>if any man</HI>:" but &s;uffice it to &s;ay, that the call of the go&s;pel is not &s;pecial, or per&s;onal; but general, extending to all men. "<HI>Through the redemption which is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI>" all men are freed from their fir&s;t-covenant of grace, or brought into a &s;aveable &s;tate, that if we peri&s;h we mu&s;t peri&s;h of free choice; none are excluded this covenant, or call of the
<PB N="14" REF="015745_0014_0FA51D03BA5DAA68">
go&s;pel; to a compliance with which, &s;alvati|on is connected, not as a <HI>reward</HI> to our works or endeavours; but through (as it were) an additional grant of that grace, which fir&s;t pro|po&s;ed the covenant, or call of the go&s;pel: Hence &s;aith the <HI>Amen,</HI> the faithful and true witne&s;s, if <HI>any man</HI> hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in, &amp;c. Chri&s;t not only propo&s;es the terms on which he will be re|conciled; but al&s;o draws the line where he will fir&s;t meet the &s;inner for this purpo&s;e, not according to our work but according to his grace.</P>
<P>Where this line is drawn; and what is requi&s;ite to our coming thereto; is the pre&s;ent &s;ubject-matter of enquiry.</P>
<P>Let us then as propo&s;ed inquire into the import of hearing Chri&s;t's voice; which is propo&s;ed as the fir&s;t branch of duty: This, beyond doubt is a knowledge of, and a&s;&s;ent to the truths of the go&s;pel revelation; together with a belief, or &s;trong per&s;ua&s;ion that Chri&s;t by his &s;pirit, through his go&s;pel, is knocking at the door of our hearts for admittance. This, by our former divines has been called a law work, or the fir&s;t &s;tep is conver&s;ion. It is a &s;tate of rational conviction, and &s;piritual awaknings or the &s;tate of the almo&s;t Chri&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> To this &s;tate of con&s;ideration and awakening,
<PB N="15" REF="015745_0015_0FA51D04550F0D60">
the means of grace have a peculiar tendency to bring mankind; e&s;pecially when accompa|nied with the &s;pirit of God: Hence the men that traveled to Emaus felt their hearts burn within them, while Chri&s;t talked to them, and explained the &s;criptures: In like manner, the heart of Lydia was opened (under the preaching of Paul) to receive the truth. Un|der the preaching of Peter the Jews were &s;o pricked to the heart, that they cried as in <HI>agony, "men and brethren what &s;hall we do to be &s;aved.</HI>"</P>
<P>Every per&s;on that has come to years of di&s;cretion, is a witne&s;s for Chri&s;t, that <HI>he</HI> hath knocked at the door of his heart: All hear the voice of Chri&s;t, in his word, providence, or &s;pirit, however carele&s;s and inattentive they may be: Not all that hear the voice of Chri&s;t &s;hall be &s;aved, no, but from this &s;tep many may, and do fall away, and turn to their former wickedne&s;s, like the dog to his vomit: But <HI>the&s;e</HI> are difficult to be renewed again unto repentance: Such was the &s;tate of the man that <HI>walked through dry places &s;eeking re&s;t, and finding none; but returning to his hou&s;e, be found it empty, &s;wept and gar|ni&s;hed; and taking to him&s;elf &s;even other &s;pi|rits more wicked than him&s;elf they entered in and dwelt there; and his la&s;t &s;tate was wor&s;e
<PB N="16" REF="015745_0016_0FA51D069BD66760">
than his fir&s;t.</HI> This is a true repre&s;entation of &s;inners falling from their convictions, and the fearful con&s;equences of &s;uch conduct.</P>
<P>Hence furthermore, our hearing the voice of Chri&s;t is not &s;ufficient to bring us to that line which he has drawn, but he requires that we <HI>open the door</HI> to him: This will bring us to that line, at which, by an act of grace he has appointed to meet the returning &s;inner: But fully to determine how much is implied in this phraze of "<HI>opening the door</HI>" is not a little difficult. Mode&s;ty in expre&s;&s;ion and thought, becomes mortals on &s;uch an impor|tant point: Let it be our attendant while we pro&s;ecute our inquiry.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable here, that &s;ome have placed the "<HI>opening of the door,</HI>" in an a&s;&s;ent of the under&s;tanding or in hearing the voice as ju&s;t con&s;idered; which we found &s;hort of the end, in that many might and did fall therefrom, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>yielding their members &s;ervants <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> righteou&s;ne&s;s unto holine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Others have placed it, in a con&s;ent of the will, which, (though an indeterminate phraze; yet, as it is generally under&s;tood for a united act of under&s;tanding, will and affections,) as far over-&s;hoots the mark, as the other fell &s;hort; for it &s;uppo&s;es a gracious exerci&s;e in the heart, anticedent to a principle of holine&s;s, or
<PB N="17" REF="015745_0017_0FA51CE9E59F5900">
the implantation of the new nature; which in the be&s;t view, is ab&s;urd and contradictory.</P>
<P>To avoid both of the&s;e extremes, we mu&s;t &s;ee what man can do in a &s;tate of nature, un|der the awaknings of God's &s;pirit; and whe|ther this will not remove the ob&s;tacles which hinder Chri&s;t from entering the heart. Where, be it ob&s;erved, that though man, by his fall from rectitude, lo&s;t all moral power, nay, and has his "<HI>under&s;tanding darkned through the ignorance that is in him</HI>;" yet, he is a rational creature and free-agent; and on this <HI>con&s;ideration,</HI> ari&s;es the requirement in our text, not becau&s;e Chri&s;t cannot enter the mo&s;t perver&s;e and &s;tubborn heart, but becau&s;e he will treat us as free agents and ac|countable creatures; therefore the opening of the door, is &s;omething not only con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>this,</HI> but within its reach, under the influences of God's &s;pirit. Let us view man in this character of <HI>rationality</HI>; we &s;hall find him always acting by the fir&s;t law of nature, &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, this is the ca&s;e of all men in a &s;tate of &s;piritual awaknings; they &s;eek to avoid the impending evil, however they may mi&s;take the means: Fear of pu|ni&s;hment for &s;in, rou&s;es them to fly from the wrath to come; and apprehen&s;ions of mercy in Chri&s;t, &s;upports them under the&s;e
<PB N="18" REF="015745_0018_0FA51D081A3BD9D0">
fears. This is according to the principle implanted in our nature and as &s;uch is ration|al and laudable, though not meritorious; but in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, is the highe&s;t &s;ource from which a man can act without a prin|ciple of grace: And in this we mu&s;t allow him to be a free-agent, capable of choo&s;ing and refu&s;ing; and of con&s;equence, capable of moral hone&s;ty and &s;incerity: He may have the &s;ame kind and &s;ame degree of &s;in|cerity and hone&s;ty in all his intentions and re&s;olutions to avoid &s;in, from a fear of hell and apprehen&s;ion of mercy through Chri&s;t, as he can have to fulfil any moral obligation towards man: As it is po&s;&s;ible he may fail in both; &s;o is it po&s;&s;ible he may per|&s;evere in both, under the power of God's &s;pirit; though as yet void of a true principle of grace: He is as capable of the one, as the other, the latter of which, no man doubts of; and why of the former? Both, are acts of real hone&s;ty and &s;incerity differing but in the <HI>object of intention</HI>; which can never alter a man's capability of performance.</P>
<P>A man under convictions of &s;in, and awak|nings of the &s;pirit may have as &s;incere <HI>pre|&s;ent intentions</HI> to avoid &s;in; as the be&s;t Saint; though ari&s;ing from a different &s;ource, viz. Fear of puni&s;hment and appre|hen&s;ion
<PB N="19" REF="015745_0019_0FA51D08D41CBE20">
of mercy in the Lord Je&s;us; and therefore more likely to fall away. And the man that does thus exert his hone&s;ty and &s;incere endeavours and intentions of avoiding &s;in, and yielding that Chri&s;t &s;hall take the lead; does for the pre&s;ent lay down his car|nal weapons; not out of love; but of ne|ce&s;&s;ity; that he may e&s;cape a greater evil: And in &s;o doing, I conceive acts from the highe&s;t principle of human nature in its fal|len &s;tate; and goes to his utmo&s;t &s;tretch un|til Chri&s;t comes into the heart.</P>
<P>I imagine (though with reverence to|wards God, and deference to my fathers) that this will an&s;wer to all intents and pur|po&s;es, the opening the door to Chri&s;t. What impediments, what bars, what ob&s;tacles are there in the way? None mo&s;t certainly; but Chri&s;t may enter the heart without mo|le&s;tation: For though there are no longings or out-breathings of &s;oul after Chri&s;t, from a principle of love, &s;o neither on the contrary is there re&s;i&s;ting or &s;triving again&s;t him: Otherwi&s;e the hone&s;ty and &s;incerity of re&s;o|lution contended for, is entirely de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>And that a man (con&s;i&s;tent with free agency) may (under the awaknings of the &s;pirit) be brought to this &s;tate of pa&s;&s;ive|ne&s;s and re&s;ignation, is not to be doubted; it
<PB N="20" REF="015745_0020_0FA51D15E4FEE6C8">
has been a&s;&s;erted by all ancient Calvini&s;tical divines, as the &s;tate where Chri&s;t meets the &s;inner with &s;aving grace. But to make the idea clearer, &s;uffer the following &s;imilitude &s;uited ro the idea, &s;inners commonly have of GOD: Suppo&s;e a man was captivated by a cruel nation, by who&s;e laws all captives &s;hould be burnt at the &s;take; but yet from &s;ome &s;elf end, or compa&s;&s;ion they &s;hould make this offer to him; that it he would &s;ubmit to take their mark, and wear their livery, by which, he &s;hould be bound to them for ever; he &s;hould be immediately unloo&s;ed, and enjoy their privileges; I &s;ay, &s;uppo&s;e a man in this ca&s;e; would he not be capable of the &s;tricte&s;t hone&s;ty, and highe&s;t degree of liberty in his choice? Beyond doubt: And if he &s;hould accept; though not out of love to them, but dread of the faggot, yet the reward is certain; not for the &s;ake of his choice, but according to their appointment, for the fulfilment of their veracity, and ma|nife&s;tation of grace. Exactly &s;uch is the ca&s;e with the awakned &s;inner; he has no alterna|tive but &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Chri&s;t or the devil; he &s;ees a flaming hell on one hand, and has a glimmering hope on the other: Rea&s;on de|cides the choice (though again&s;t carnal af|fection) and hone&s;t and &s;incere re&s;olutions af|fect
<PB N="21" REF="015745_0021_0FA51D0B1EAC5B20">
it, and through an appointment and grant of grace, the con&s;equence is happy and certain.</P>
<P>When the man thus hone&s;tly and &s;incere|ly chu&s;es a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Chri&s;t, he may en|ter the heart without violence to the will or free-agency of the man: This removes the impediments which lay in the heart to ob&s;truct Chri&s;t; or it opens the door to him: The man can do no more till Chri&s;t come in; he cannot put forth exerci&s;es of grace to welcome him into his heart, anticedent to the implantation of the new nature; there|fore, &s;tands in this &s;tate of pa&s;&s;ivene&s;s and re&s;ignation, while Chri&s;t enters and forms him&s;elf in the &s;oul.

<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I will come in to him.</P>
<P>Here is the line where we fir&s;t meet Chri&s;t: Having yielded the point of &s;aving our&s;elves, as above, he is ready to help us; by applying to our &s;ouls the healing Balm of Giliad. But had Chri&s;t come in before this re&s;ignation, he mu&s;t have deprived us of free-agency, and made us act as <HI>meer machines,</HI> not accountable creatures, and thus have de&s;troyed all virtue throughout the whole moral &s;y&s;tem: But the holy Je&s;us will &s;ooner &s;uffer us to go down to hell, ac|cording to our own choice, than do this to

have his &s;aving influences; we mo&s;t &s;ee and feel our guilty &s;tate and need of his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, and &s;ubmit to receive it: Then he enters the heart by our permi&s;&s;ion; and hav|ing pa&s;&s;ed the door he takes full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heart. Now he binds the &s;trong man, the <HI>influences of Satan,</HI> and de&s;troys the old man, the <HI>body of &s;in and corruption</HI>: Having got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the under&s;tanding, he leads on to the will and affections: He ra&s;es the devil's kingdom to the ground and &s;ets up his own in its &s;tead, and thus <HI>leads captivity captive and gives gifts unto men.</HI> He forms the &s;oul into a conformity to the divine pattern; gives a new heart and a new &s;pirit, fitting the man for every good work; and he believes to the &s;alvation of the &s;oul. This leads us to con&s;ider in the la&s;t place.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> What is implied in Chri&s;t's &s;up|ing with the returning &s;inner, &amp; he with him. Eating and drinking, are often u&s;ed in &s;crip|ture for enjoyment and fulne&s;s of &s;piritual good things: Our &s;upping with Chri&s;t may then imply that we experience the ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s of them who hunger and are filled with the fullne&s;s of Chri&s;t: And al&s;o that we are now at peace and agreement; for being formed in Chri&s;t, we can no more be at va|riance, but delight in him and he in us;

hence he &s;ays, <HI>my father will love him and I will love him, and we will come unto him and take up our abode with him.</HI> Chri&s;t not on|ly &s;anctifies, but abides in our hearts, and delights to commune with us by his &s;pirit hence this &s;upping together is called the <HI>Fellow&s;hip of the Spirit,</HI> there are &s;piritual communications from Chri&s;t to believers and out breathings of &s;oul in believers after Chri&s;t: Truly &s;ays the beloved de&s;ciple <HI>our fellow&s;hip is with the father, and in his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Chri&s;t not only puts life into the &s;oul; but maintains it, and upholds fellow&s;hip with it: This is the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of them that open the door unto the <HI>Amen,</HI> the faithful and true witne&s;s, he &s;ups with them, and they with him.</P>

<P><PB N="24" REF="015745_0024_0FA51D10F034F528">Let all the unregenerate &s;peedily open the door unto Chri&s;t. For the inforceing of this exhortation, I &s;hall &s;how that Chri&s;t has removed every impediment and di&s;courage|ment out of the way; except, what ari&s;es from their own <HI>wilfulne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Let us my friends, con&s;ider &s;ome of tho&s;e objections you &s;et in &s;uch a formida|ble light again&s;t coming to Chri&s;t: You &s;ay we are externally poor and vile, even con|temptible in the eye of the world; Je&s;us will not regard us if we come. What &s;irs, will you change God into a devil that de|lights in wickedne&s;s! Is he taken with the glitter of a fop, the title of a noble, or chat|ter of a wit? No, this is a helli&s;h delu&s;ion: GOD is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons, he looks at the &s;incerity of the heart; the humble beggar on the dung-hill, is more acceptable to GOD, than the haughty king on the throne: Chri&s;t knows no difference be|tween the rich and the poor, honored and de&s;pi&s;ed in this world: But all who &s;incere|ly come to him, are his friends. Neither grandure or poverty can influence GOD; for all are his, the beggar even as the king. <HI>Hence,</HI> 1 Cor. I. 26. <HI>ye &s;ee brethren, your calling, how that not many mighty, not many noble are called, but GOD hath cho&s;en the
<PB N="25" REF="015745_0025_0FA51D11F37D1B48">
fooli&s;h things of this world to confound the wi&s;e; and ba&s;e things of the world, and things which are de&s;pi&s;ed hath God cho&s;en.</HI> So &s;ays James, Chap. II. 5. <HI>God hath cho&s;en the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promi&s;ed to them that love him:</HI>" Thus you have encourage|ment rather than di&s;couragement; there|fore open the door unto Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But &s;ome of you will &s;ay, we are inter|nally vile and poluted with &s;in, from the crown of the head to the &s;ole of the foot, and may not come to Chri&s;t until we are better.</P>
<P>This is not of God, but of Satan and your own proud hearts; you are the very per&s;ons Chri&s;t is now inviteing, for you he died; for you he lives: To this very purpo&s;e, he made him&s;elf a propitiatory &s;acrifice for &s;in: He tells you that he is the phy&s;ician of &s;ouls, and that the &s;ick, not the whole need the phy|&s;ician. Were you whole, or clean from &s;in, you would have no need of Chri&s;t. Were you &s;ick in body nigh unto death, would you wait till you were better, or well, before you applied to the doctor? No; why not thus rea&s;onable in &s;piritual &s;ickne&s;s? Becau&s;e you are polluted, you need purify|ing: Apply to Chri&s;t then as you are; he
<PB N="26" REF="015745_0026_0FA51D129F0B8E38">
knows your polution, and will have you know it and apply to him in all of it, by opening the door: When he thus finds you in your blood, he will &s;ay to your &s;ouls live; he expects you as filthy as &s;in can make you; but he has white raiment to cover your nakedne&s;s, that your &s;hame no more ap|pear.</P>
<P>However great your guilt; though your &s;ins are many and black as hell; yet you &s;hall be welcome: Hear the words of Chri&s;t, <HI>though your &s;ins be as &s;carlet, they &s;hall be white as &s;now; though they be red like crim|&s;on they &s;hall be like wool.</HI>" Thus your internal vilene&s;s can be no di&s;couragement, but to the contrary: Come then, open the door to Chri&s;t, and you &s;hall receive of his white raiment; and <HI>your beauty &s;hall be perfect through the comeline&s;s that he &s;hall put on you.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;ome of you will &s;ay, we are not on|ly great; but old &s;inners, who have been guilty of great neglects, and repeated refu|&s;als of God's grace; that we are afraid to look towards the mercy-&s;eat.</P>
<P>Sirs, your confe&s;&s;ion is hone&s;t; but your application of it is neither to your own comfort or the honor of God's grace: Spi|ritual &s;loth and indolence &s;eem to be prede|minant,
<PB N="27" REF="015745_0027_0FA51D1359BE3D90">
and &s;atan's &s;tratagems too ea&s;ily ad|mited. But awake, be zealous and repent; I dare a&s;&s;ure you there is hope; nay, from your own objection it is plain; if Chri&s;t is irreconceliable, how is it that his &s;pirit ena|bles you thus to &s;ee and confe&s;s your former neglect's and refu&s;als? It is plain that though you have for&s;aken God, he has not for&s;aken you, but is now calling; Chri&s;t is knocking at the door, hear his voice then, and open the door &s;peedily.</P>
<P>You can never an&s;wer for any delays, but hereby you add fuel to fire; you encrea&s;e your guilt; your conduct is irrational. Was a man under &s;entence of Death for rebellion, but had an offer of pardon on condition he would wear the King's livery; (though his idea of the &s;ervice was di&s;agree|able, yet) would he he&s;itate one moment about accepting, to &s;ave his life? No, go ye then and do likewi&s;e: Time may be yet, but cannot be long; therefore make no fur|ther delays. There is grace &s;ufficient; did not Chri&s;t ca&s;t &s;even devils out of Mary Magdalene and received her into favour? Did he not pardon the thief on the Cro&s;s? Why then are ye &s;o faithle&s;s? Come open the door, he now calls, <HI>Turn O back&s;liding children, for I am married unto you; and I

will take you one of a city, and two of a fami|ly; and I will bring you to Zion.</HI> Here then, is no impediment, but Chri&s;t &s;tands with open arms to receive you.</P>
<P>Well &s;ay you, granting all this to be true; yet we have no &s;trength or ability to be|lieve in Chri&s;t; and without faith it is im|po&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God; we can therefore do nothing.</P>
<P>Friends you do not rea&s;on wi&s;ely in this matter: But &s;hew a di&s;ingenuous mind, and heart bent on eva&s;ion. Your objection is pointed, not again&s;t opening the door to Chri&s;t, but again&s;t the exerci&s;es of faith and holine&s;s while in a &s;tate of nature; in which ca&s;e, your inability and impotency is readily granted, but yet not excu&s;able, both as the fault is yours, and al&s;o, as you have an op|portunity to be delivered from it. Though you cannot put forth the exerci&s;es of faith and repentance; yet you can hone&s;tly and &s;incerely yield to receive &s;uch a principle of action: The point is not whether you can prefer Chri&s;t, or holine&s;s to your lu&s;ts and carnal plea&s;ures: but whether under your awaknings, you can prefer Chri&s;t's offer of giving you &s;uch a temper of holine&s;s, to the flames of hell, which has been already prov|ed both po&s;&s;ible and rational. However
<PB N="29" REF="015745_0029_0FA51D14E2D2A088">
aver&s;e to the ways of holine&s;s, yet having the torments of hell on the one hand, and the offers of Chri&s;t to come in and form our-hearts for holine&s;s on the other, and no al|ternative but this, you could certainly make a choice, and this hone&s;t and &s;incere. This is exactly agreeable to the vulgar &s;aying, out of two evils chu&s;e the lea&s;t, of which no man was ever &s;u&s;pected of inability: This, as has been &s;hewn, removes all impediments out of the heart; not only makes the man humble, but re&s;igned, that Chri&s;t can come in con&s;i&s;tent with man's free choice, u&s;ing no kind of violence. Therefore Sirs, though you have no &s;trength or ability to believe, yet you can open the door to Chri&s;t; which being done, he will give you a prin|ciple of holine&s;s, and anoint your eyes with eye-&s;alve that you may &s;ee the beauty of ho|line&s;s, and deformity of &s;in, and believe to the &s;alvation of your &s;ouls.</P>
<P>Thus all impediments are removed out of the way of your coming to Chri&s;t, but what ari&s;es from your own wilfulne&s;s, come then and delay not: But be a&s;&s;ured that if you peri&s;h, you peri&s;h of free choice, and hell ju&s;tly your de&s;ert: If you now refu&s;e Chri&s;t, and fa&s;t bolt the door again&s;t him, rely on it he will be revenged; he hath pre|pared
