<HEAD>THE CASE, ARGUMENTS AND DECISION, OF THE COURT.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The <HI>adjournment</HI> of this Ca&s;e originated in <HI>novelty</HI> and <HI>dif|ficulty,</HI> touching the <HI>con&s;titutionality,</HI> or <HI>judicial propriety</HI> of the judges of the DISTRICT COURT, carrying the fol|lowing clau&s;e of an act of the General A&s;&s;embly into execu|tion, which was conceived to be oppo&s;ed to, or in direct violation of the Con&s;titution of the Commonwealth of Vir|ginia.</P>

<P>The title and clau&s;e of the &s;aid act are thus:</P>
<P><Q>An Act reducing into one, the &s;everal Acts concern|ing the E&s;tabli&s;hment, Juri&s;diction, and Powers of Di&s;trict Courts.</Q></P>

<P>The Honourable, the Judges, delivered their re&s;pective opinions touching the ca&s;e afore&s;aid, in the following manner:</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="opinion of judge">
<HEAD>JUDGE NELSON.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is a motion for an injunction, adjourned from the Di&s;trict Court of Dumfries, on the con&s;titutionality of the eleventh &s;ection of the Di&s;trict-Court law<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>1792.</HI></NOTE>, which gives the Di&s;trict-Court in term time, or a Judge thereof in vacation, the &s;ame power of granting injunctions to &s;tay proceedings on any judgment obtained in a di&s;trict-court, and of pro|ceeding to the di&s;&s;olution or final hearing of &s;uits commenc|ing by injunction, under the &s;ame rules and regulations as are now pre&s;cribed to the High Court of Chancery.</P>
<P>I &s;hall con&s;ider the que&s;tion under <HI>two</HI> points.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> Whether, if this clau&s;e be contrary to the con&s;titu|tion of this Commonwealth, it can be executed.</P>
<P>And, <HI>Secondly.</HI> Whether it be contrary to the con&s;titu|tion.</P>
<P N="1">I. As to the fir&s;t point, although it has been decided by the Judges of the court of Appeals, (whether judicially or not is another que&s;tion,) that a law contrary, to the con&s;ti|tion is <HI>void</HI>&mdash;I beg leave to make a few ob&s;ervations on ge|neral principles.</P>
<P>The difference between a free and an arbitrary govern|ment I take to be&mdash;that in the former limits are a&s;&s;igned
<PB N="8" REF="027777_0006_0FD63DB4414B4C80">
to tho&s;e to whom the admini&s;tration is committed; but the latter depends on the will of the departments or &s;ome of them. Hence the utility of a written con&s;titution.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the American edition of the Encyclopaedia, <Q><HI>Con&s;titution</HI> in matters of policy, &s;ignifies the form of government e&s;tabli&s;hed in any country or kingdom.</Q></P><P><Q><HI>Con&s;titution</HI> al&s;o denotes an ordinance, deci&s;ion, regulation, or law made by authority, &s;uperior eccle&s;ia&s;tical or civil.</Q></P><P>That the word Con&s;titution in the title of the in&s;trument under con|&s;ideration, is not &s;ynonymous with ordinance or law, (as &s;eems to be the opinion of the able author of "Notes on Virginia,) but is u&s;ed in the former &s;en&s;e is evident from its being called "the Con&s;titution, or form of government, &amp;c."</P></NOTE> A <HI>Con&s;titution</HI> is that by which the powers of govern|ment are limited.</P>
<P>It is to the <HI>Governors,</HI> or rather to the departments of <HI>Government,</HI> what a <HI>law</HI> is to individuals&mdash;nay it is not only a <HI>rule</HI> of <HI>action</HI> to the branches of government, but it is that from which their exi&s;tence flows, and by which the powers, (or portions of the right to govern) which may have been committed to them, are pre&s;cribed&mdash;It is their commi&s;&s;ion&mdash;nay it is their <HI>Creator.</HI></P>
<P>The calling this in&s;trument The <HI>Con&s;titution</HI> or <HI>form</HI> of <HI>Government,</HI> &s;hews that the framers intended it to have this effect, and I &s;hall pre&s;ently endeavor to obviate the objec|tion ari&s;ing from the want of their appointment in form.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent que&s;tion is whether an act of the legi&s;lature contrary to it, be valid?</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See &s;econd Section of the Con&s;titution.</NOTE>This is the paper by which the <HI>delegates</HI> and <HI>repre&s;enta|tives</HI> of the people, viewing with concern the deplorable &s;ituation to which this country mu&s;t have been reduced unle&s;s &s;ome <HI>regular adequate mode</HI> or civil <HI>polity,</HI> had been &s;peedily adopted, did <HI>ordain</HI> and <HI>declare</HI> the <HI>future form</HI> of government to be as there &s;et forth.</P>

<P>This is the very paper under which there are two branch|es of legi&s;lature now a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>This is the very paper under which they are to meet once every year, or oftener.</P>
<P>This is the very paper which gives them their &s;tyle&mdash;of the GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF VIRGINIA.</P>
<P>This is the very paper which calls one hou&s;e the Hou&s;e of Delegates, and the other the Senate.</P>
<P>This is the very paper which declares that the former &s;hall con&s;i&s;t of two repre&s;entatives from each county, cho|&s;en by freeholders, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This is the very paper which fixes the number of the Se|nate to twenty-four&mdash;which defines the number that &s;hall compo&s;e a hou&s;e of &s;enate,&mdash;under which the &s;tate is to be divided into twenty-four di&s;tricts.</P>
<P>Which declares that each county &s;hall vote for a &s;ena|tor, who be&s;ides other qualifications &s;hall be twenty-five years of age&mdash;that a compari&s;on of polls &s;hall be made by the &s;heriffs, who are to return the per&s;on having the greate&s;t number of votes.</P>
<P>That a certain number are to be di&s;placed by rotation.</P>
<P>That writs may i&s;&s;ue from each hou&s;e for &s;upplying va|cancies&mdash;And&mdash;</P>
<P>That all laws &s;hall originate in the Hou&s;e of delegates &s;ubject to amendment by the &s;enate, except money bills.</P>
<P>I a&s;k then, whether the legi&s;lature do not &s;it under the Con&s;titution?</P>
<P>The an&s;wer in the affirmative to me is inevitable.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="027777_0008_0FD63DB9867968E0">But it may be objected that, although the legi&s;lature would be bound by a fundamental regulation, made by a convention or other body delegated expre&s;sly for &s;uch a purpo&s;e, the body who formed this, not having been thus &s;pecially appointed,&mdash;this act po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not &s;ufficient &s;anctity; but is an act equal only to tho&s;e of a common legi&s;lature becau&s;e &s;ome acts pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame &s;e&s;&s;ion are confe&s;&s;ed|ly &s;o.</P>
<P>Here let it be remembered that the que&s;tion is not whe|ther the <HI>people</HI> can change it; but whether the legi&s;lature can do &s;o.</P>
<P>As to the powers of the Convention, this body &s;eems to have been appointed, not only to &s;ee that the Common|wealth &s;u&s;tained no injury, but al&s;o to con&s;ult in general for the public good, and in &s;uch a cri&s;is as that at which our government was formed, tho&s;e who are delegated have authority more exten&s;ive than a legi&s;lature appointed under a government, one object of which is to re&s;train that as well as the other departments,&mdash;whereas in the former ca&s;e the people alone can decide whether the&s;e pow|ers have been &s;trained too far.</P>
<P>As to &s;ome acts of the &s;ame &s;e&s;&s;ion being temporary and others revocable by the legi&s;lature.&mdash;</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, that the &s;ubject-matter of them will evince which are intended to be of this nature, and if any were de&s;igned to be permanent, they mu&s;t be &s;o until changed by the people, unle&s;s indeed calling the&s;e <HI>ordinances</HI> and the other a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See note, page <HI>8.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Con&s;titution,</HI> &s;ufficiently manife&s;t a de&s;ign that <HI>this</HI> &s;hould be of higher authority than <HI>tho&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>It is confe&s;&s;edly the a&s;&s;ent of the People which gives validity to a Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>May not the people then, by a &s;ub&s;equent acquie&s;cence and a&s;&s;ent give a Con&s;titution, under which they have acted for &s;eventeen years as much validity, at lea&s;t <HI>&s;o long as they
<PB N="11" REF="027777_0009_0FD63DBB07C78808">
acquie&s;ce</HI> in it, as if it had been previou&s;ly expre&s;sly author|ized?</P>
<P>The people have received this as a Con&s;titution. The magi&s;trates and officers down to a con&s;table (for even the mode of <HI>his</HI> appointment is directed) have been appointed under it.</P>
<P>The people have felt its operation and acquie&s;ced.</P>
<P>Who then can change it?</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, the <HI>PEOPLE</HI> alone.</P>
<P>But it has been &s;uppo&s;ed that the <HI>legi&s;lature</HI> can do this.</P>
<P>To decide this que&s;tion I have already &s;tated that the legi&s;lature derive their <HI>exi&s;tence</HI> from the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>It may be an&s;wered that tho&s;e Members who pa&s;&s;ed the law under contemplation were elected under the act of 1785.</P>
<P>But who held the election? Who was to decide in ca&s;e of an equality of votes? and, who certified the per&s;ons elected?&mdash;The <HI>&s;heriff</HI> under the law. Who appointed the &s;heriff?&mdash;The executive.&mdash;By what authority? &mdash;Under the fifteenth article of this Con&s;titution, which the legi&s;lature from their acts acknowledge to be inviola|ble.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Appendix for reference to the particular laws.</NOTE></P>
<P>If then the legi&s;lature were elected at an election hold|en by, and were returned by a &s;heriff, who derives his commi&s;&s;ion from the Con&s;titution, does not that body de|rive its exi&s;tence from the &s;ame &s;ource?</P>
<P>And can the legi&s;lature impugn that charter under which they claim, and to which by their acts they them|&s;elves have acknowledged an obligation?&mdash;I apprehend not, nor can any argument again&s;t this po&s;ition be drawn from an acquie&s;cence in &s;ome acts which may be uncon&s;titu|tional.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="12" REF="027777_0010_0FD63DBC9D8F6DB8">1&s;t. Becau&s;e we may pre&s;ume, that if there be any &s;uch, their uncon&s;titutionality has not yet been di&s;covered by the legi&s;lature, which, if it had been done, (from the in&s;tance before recited, and &s;ome other in&s;tances) we have rea&s;on to think, would have produced a &s;i|milar declaration from that body.&mdash;And</P>
<P N="2">2dly, Becau&s;e no individual may have yet felt the oper|ation of them, and con&s;equently they have not been brought to inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t objection &s;till remains, that the judici|ary, by declaring an act of the legi&s;lature to be no law, a&s;&s;umes legi&s;lative authority, or claims a &s;uperiority over the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this,&mdash;I do not con&s;ider the judiciary as the champions of the people, or of the Con&s;titution, bound to &s;ound the alarm, and to excite an oppo&s;ition to the le|gi&s;lature.&mdash;But, when the ca&s;es of individuals are brought before them judicially, they are bound to decide.</P>
<P>And, if one man claim under an act contrary to the Con&s;titution, that is, under what is <HI>no</HI> law, if my former po&s;ition, that the legi&s;lature cannot impugn the Con&s;titu|tion, and con&s;equently that an act again&s;t it is void&mdash;be ju&s;t,) mu&s;t not a court give judgment again&s;t him?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>There are but three lines of conduct, one of which mu&s;t be pur|&s;ued on &s;uch an occa&s;ion,&mdash;either</P><P N="1">1&s;t, To refu&s;e to decide the que&s;tion at all, which would be a dere|liction of duty, or</P><P N="2">2dly, To wait for the legi&s;lature to decide whether the act be un|con&s;titutional, which would be contrary to that article in the Con|&s;titution, which declares, that <Q>the legi&s;lative, executive, and judiciary departments &s;hall be &s;eparate and di&s;tinct, &s;o that nei|ther exerci&s;e the powers properly belonging to the other.</Q>&mdash;&s;ince to decide whether the plaintiff or the defendant under the exi&s;ting laws have a right, is a judicial act, and to decide whether the act be a void law as to a right ve&s;ted or in litigation, is in fact to decide which of the parties have the right.</P><P>There remains therefore when the que&s;tion occurs, but one thing to be done by the judiciary,&mdash;which is,</P><P N="3">3dly, To decide that the act is void, and therefore that the claimant under it cannot &s;ucceed.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="027777_0011_0FD63DBED0CA4378">Nor is it a novelty for the judiciary to declare, whether an act of the legi&s;lature <HI>be in force</HI> or <HI>not in force,</HI> or in other words, whether it be a <HI>law</HI> or <HI>not.</HI></P>
<P>In many in&s;tances one &s;tatute is virtually repealed by another, and the judiciary mu&s;t decide which is the law, or whether both can exi&s;t together.</P>
<P>The only difference is that in one in&s;tance that which was once in exi&s;tence is carried out of exi&s;tence, by a &s;ub&s;e|quent act virtually contrary to it, and in the other the prior <HI>fundamental law</HI> has prevented its <HI>coming into exi&s;tence</HI> as <HI>a law.</HI></P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the idea that for the judiciary to declare an act of the legi&s;lature void,&mdash;is to claim a &s;uperiority to the legi&s;lature,&mdash;if the legi&s;lative authority is derived from the Con&s;titution, and &s;uch a deci&s;ion be a judicial act (as I have endeavoured to prove) this objection &s;eems to be re|futed.</P>
<P>For the rea&s;ons which I have given, I am of opinion that the fundamental act of government controuls the legi&s;la|ture, who owe their exi&s;tence and powers to it&mdash;this con|cludes the fir&s;t point&mdash;</P>
<P>That if the clau&s;e under con&s;ideration be uncon&s;titution|al, it is <HI>void.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. The &s;econd point&mdash;whether it be uncon&s;titutional is next to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>By the fourteenth &s;ection of the Con&s;titution, "the two hou&s;es of A&s;&s;embly &s;hall, by joint ballot, appoint Judges of
<PB N="14" REF="027777_0012_0FD63DC0C928C5B8">
the Supreme Court of Appeals, and general court, <HI>Judges</HI> in Chancery, Judges of Admiralty, &amp;c."</P>
<P>I was at fir&s;t inclined to think that the in&s;ertion of the word <HI>Judges</HI> between the <HI>General Court</HI> and <HI>Chancery,</HI> evinced an intention that the judges of the general court and tho&s;e in chancery &s;hould be di&s;tinct per&s;ons; but per|haps it would be unju&s;tifiable to re&s;t &s;uch an opinion on &s;o critical a con&s;truction.</P>
<P>However this opinion is &s;upported by the &s;ixteenth and &s;eventeenth &s;ections.</P>
<P>By the &s;ixteenth the governor and others offending again&s;t the &s;tate, by mal-admini&s;tration, corruption, &amp;c. are impeachable before the general court. And&mdash;</P>
<P>By the &s;eventeenth the judges of the general court are to be impeached before the court of appeals.&mdash;This might prove then that a judge of the general court could not according to the Con&s;titution be a judge of the &s;upreme court of appeals, becau&s;e all officers (except the judges of the general court,) are to be tried before the general court; but Judges of the general court are to be tried before the court of appeals&mdash;and the Con&s;titution intended to pre|vent a man being tried in that court of which he is a mem|ber; becau&s;e in cau&s;es which might give ri&s;e to an impeach|ment, the judges of a court might act jointly, and the in|fluence of partiality or an <HI>e&s;prit du Corps</HI> was to be guarded again&s;t.</P>
<P>However to decide whether a judge of the general court could be a judge of the court of appeals, would be extraju|dicial as that que&s;tion is not before the court, but this re|&s;earch enables me to decide the que&s;tion that is before the court&mdash;that is, whether the &s;ame per&s;on can under the Con|&s;titution be a judge in chancery, and a judge of the gene|ral court?&mdash;I think that he cannot for the&s;e rea&s;ons&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="027777_0013_0FD63DC539AC2130">A judge in chancery is to be tried before the general court.&mdash;A judge of the general court cannot be a judge in chancery, becau&s;e a judge in chancery mu&s;t be tried be|fore the general court; but if a judge of the general court be a judge in chancery, then he (a judge of the general court) will be tried in the general court which is again&s;t the &s;eventeenth article, which declares that a judge of the ge|neral court &s;hall be impeached before the court of ap|peals.</P>
<P>My inference is that a judge in chancery and a judge of the general court were intended under the Con&s;titution to be di&s;tinct individuals.</P>
<P>This is one rea&s;on again&s;t the law; but there are others al&s;o of force&mdash;Whoever is appointed a judge in chancery under the Con&s;titution mu&s;t be elected by joint ballot, and commi&s;&s;ioned by the governor; neither of which requi&s;itions have been complied with.</P>
<P>On the whole, I am for certifying to the court below, That the motion for an injunction be over-ruled, the clau&s;e under which it is prayed being uncon&s;titutional.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="opinion of judge">
<HEAD>JUDGE ROANE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS great que&s;tion was adjourned by me from the di&s;|trict court of Dumfries. I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to obtain the opinion of this court, for the government of the &s;eve|ral di&s;trict courts, who might otherwi&s;e have differed in their con&s;truction of the clau&s;e in que&s;tion, and the admi|ni&s;tration of the law in this in&s;tance been con&s;equently partial.</P>
<P>My opinion then was upon a &s;hort con&s;ideration, that the di&s;trict courts ought to execute this law; for I doubted
<PB N="16" REF="027777_0014_0FD63DC638724588">
how far the judiciary were authorized to refu&s;e to execute a law, on the ground of its being again&s;t the &s;pirit of the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>My opinion, on more mature con&s;ideration, is changed in this re&s;pect, and I now think that the judiciary may and ought not only to refu&s;e to execute a law expre&s;sly repug|nant to the Con&s;titution; but al&s;o one which is by a plain and natural con&s;truction, in oppo&s;ition to the fundamental principles thereof.</P>
<P>I con&s;ider the people of this country as the only &s;overeign power.&mdash;I con&s;ider the legi&s;lature as not &s;overeign but &s;ub|ordinate, they are &s;ubordinate to the great con&s;titutional charter, which the people have e&s;tabli&s;hed as a fundamental law, and which alone has given exi&s;tence and authority to the legi&s;lature. I con&s;ider that at the time of the adoption of our pre&s;ent Con&s;titution, the Briti&s;h government was at an end in Virginia: it was at an end, becau&s;e among many other weighty rea&s;ons very emphatically expre&s;&s;ed in the fir&s;t &s;ection of our Con&s;titution, <Q>George the third heretofore entru&s;ted with the exerci&s;e of the kingly office in this colony had abandoned the helm of go|vernment, and declared us out of his allegiance and pro|tection.</Q></P>
<P>The people were therefore at that period, they were at the period of the election of the Convention, which form|ed the Con&s;titution, ab&s;olved from the former kingly go|vernment, and free, as in a &s;tate of nature, to e&s;tabli&s;h a government for them&s;elves. But admitting for a moment that the old government was not then at an end, I a&s;&s;ert that the people have a right by a convention, or otherwi&s;e, to change the exi&s;ting government, whil&s;t &s;uch exi&s;ting government is in actual operation, for the ordinary purpo&s;es thereof. The example of all America in the adoption of the federal government and that of &s;everal of the &s;tates in changing their &s;tate con&s;titutions in this temperate and
<PB N="17" REF="027777_0015_0FD63DC7B3F5F8B0">
peaceable manner, undeniably proves my po&s;ition. The people of Virginia, therefore, if the old government &s;hould not be con&s;idered as then at an end, permitted it to proceed, and by a convention cho&s;en by them&s;elves, with full powers, for they were not re&s;trained, e&s;tabli&s;hed then a con&s;tituti|on.</P>
<P>This Convention was not cho&s;en under the &s;anction of the former government; it was not limited in its powers by it, if indeed it exi&s;ted, but may be con&s;idered as a &s;pontane|ous a&s;&s;emblage of the people of Virginia, under a recom|mendation of a former convention, to con&s;ult for the good of them&s;elves, and their po&s;terity. They e&s;tabli&s;hed a bill of rights purporting to appertain to their po&s;terity, and a con&s;titution evidently de&s;igned to be permanent. This con&s;titution is &s;anctioned by the con&s;ent and acquie&s;ence of the people for &s;eventeen years; and it is admitted by the almo&s;t univer&s;al opinion of the people, by the repeated ad|judications of the courts of this commonwealth, and by very many declarations of the legi&s;lature it&s;elf, to be of &s;uperior authority to any oppo&s;ing act of the legi&s;lature. The celebrated Vattel in a pa&s;&s;age of his, which I will not fatigue this audience by quoting, denies to the ordinary legi&s;lature the power of changing the fundamental laws "for, &s;ays he, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the Con&s;titution of the &s;tate be fixed."</P>
<P>But if the legi&s;lature may infringe this Con&s;titution, it is no longer fixed; it is not this year what it was the la&s;t; and the liberties of the people are wholly at the mercy of the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>A very important que&s;tion now occurs, viz. who&s;e pro|vince it is to decide in &s;uch ca&s;es. It is the province of the judiciary to expound the laws, and to adjudge ca&s;es which may be brought before them&mdash;the judiciary may clearly &s;ay that a &s;ub&s;equent &s;tatute has not changed a former for want of &s;ufficient words, though it was perhaps intended it
<PB N="18" REF="027777_0016_0FD63E7F70545468">
&s;hould do &s;o. It may &s;ay too that an act of a&s;&s;embly has not changed the Con&s;titution though its words are expre&s;s to that effect, becau&s;e a legi&s;lature mu&s;t have both the power and the will (as evidenced by words) to change the law, and it is conceived for the rea&s;ons above mentioned that the legi&s;lature have not power to change the funda|mental laws. In expounding laws the judiciary con&s;iders <HI>every</HI> law which relates to the &s;ubject: would you have them to &s;hut their eyes again&s;t that law which is of the highe&s;t authority of any, or again&s;t a part of that law, which either by its words or by its &s;pirit, denies to any but the people the power to change it? In ca&s;es where the controver&s;y before the court, does not involve the private intere&s;t or relate to the powers of the judiciary, they are not only the proper, but a perfectly di&s;intere&s;ted tribunal; &mdash;e. g. if the Legi&s;lature &s;hould deprive a man of the trial by jury&mdash;there the controver&s;y is between the legi&s;lature on one hand, and the whole people of Virginia (through the medium of an individual) on the other, which people have declared that the trial by jury &s;hall be held &s;acred.</P>
<P>In other ca&s;es where the private intere&s;t of judges may be affected, or where their con&s;titutional powers are encroach|ed upon, their &s;ituation is indeed delicate, and let them be ever &s;o virtuous they will be cen&s;ured by the ill di&s;po&s;ed part of their fellow citizens: but in the&s;e ca&s;es, as well as others, they are bound to decide, and they do actually de|cide on behalf of the people&mdash;for example, though a judges is intere&s;ted privately in pre&s;erving his independence, yet 'tis the right of the people which &s;hould govern him, who in their &s;overeign character have provided that the judges &s;hould be independent; &s;o that it is in fact a controver&s;y between the legi&s;lature and the people, though perhaps the judges may be privately intere&s;ted. The only effect on the judges in &s;uch ca&s;e &s;hould be, to di&s;tru&s;t their own
<PB N="19" REF="027777_0017_0FD624D8746D43C0">
judgment if the matter is doubtful, or in other words to require clear evidence before they decide in ca&s;es where intere&s;t may po&s;&s;ibly warp the judgment.</P>
<P>From the above premi&s;es I conclude that the judiciary may and ought to adjudge a law uncon&s;titutional and void if it be plainly repugnant to the letter of the Con&s;titution, or the fundamental principles thereof. By fundamental principles I under&s;tand, tho&s;e great principles growing out of the Con&s;titution, by the aid of which, in dubious ca&s;es, the Con&s;titution may be explained and pre&s;erved inviolate; tho&s;e land-marks, which it may be nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;ort to, on account of the impo&s;&s;ibility to fore&s;ee or provide for, ca&s;es within the &s;pirit but without the letter of the Con|&s;titution.</P>
<P>To come now more immediately to the que&s;tion before the court; can tho&s;e who are appointed judges in chan|cery, by an act of a&s;&s;embly, without ballot, and without commi&s;&s;ion during good behaviour, con&s;titutionally exer|ci&s;e that office?&mdash;The fourteenth article of the Virginia Con&s;titution recites <Q>that the people have a right, to uni|form government; and therefore, that no government &s;eparate from, or independent of, the government of VIRGINIA, ought to be erected or e&s;tabli&s;hed within the limits thereof.</Q> Here then is a general principle per|vading all the courts mentioned in the Con&s;titution&mdash;from which without an exception we ought not to depart&mdash; If tho&s;e may be judges who are not appointed by joint ballot, but by an act of a&s;&s;embly, the &s;enate have in that in&s;tance more power than the Con&s;titution intended; for they control the other branch, by their negative upon the law, whereas if they mixed with that branch in a joint ballot, a plurality of votes of &s;enators and delegates would decide.</P>
<P>If there can be judges in chancery who have no com|mi&s;&s;ion during good behaviour, their tenure of office is ab|&s;olutely
<PB N="20" REF="027777_0018_0FD63DCD81C9AC10">
at the will of the legi&s;lature, and they con&s;equent|ly are not independent. The people of Virginia intended that the judiciary &s;hould be independent of the other de|partments: they are to judge where the legi&s;lature is a party, and therefore &s;hould be independent of it, other|wi&s;e they might judge corruptly in order to plea&s;e the le|gi&s;lature, and be con&s;equently continued in office. It is an acknowledged principle in all countries, that no man &s;hall be judge in his own cau&s;e; but it is nearly the &s;ame thing, where the tribunal of ju&s;tice is under the influence of a party. If the legi&s;lature can transfer from con&s;tituti|onal to legi&s;lative courts, all judicial powers, the&s;e depen|dent tribunals being the creatures of the legi&s;lature it&s;elf, will not dare to oppo&s;e an uncon&s;titutional law, and the principle I &s;et out upon, viz. that &s;uch laws ought to be oppo&s;ed would become a dead letter, or in other words, this would pave the way to an uncontrolled power in the legi&s;lature. The con&s;titution requires the concurrence of the legi&s;lature to appoint, and the executive to com|mi&s;&s;ion a judge:&mdash;but an appointment by act of a&s;&s;embly, will inve&s;t with this high power one who has not the &s;anc|tion of the executive; and will throw a new office upon a man, without the liberty of declining &s;uch appointment, if he thinks proper. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, and others which it would be tedious to enumerate, I am of opinion, that the clau&s;e in que&s;tion, is repugnant to the fundamental princi|ples of the Con&s;titution in as much as the judges of the general court have not been ballotted for and commi&s;&s;ion|ed as judges in chancery, pur&s;uant to the fourteenth arti|cle of the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Mr. ROANE then &s;aid, "Although it is not in my opi|nion now nece&s;&s;ary to decide, whether the offices of a judge in chancery and of the general court, may be united in the &s;ame per&s;on or not, &s;uppo&s;ing a con&s;titutional appoint|ment to have been made of the &s;ame per&s;on to each&mdash;yet in
<PB N="21" REF="027777_0019_0FD63DD055615F98">
as much as this que&s;tion is in &s;ome mea&s;ure involved in the one ju&s;t di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, I will give my pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ions upon it, leaving my&s;elf free to decide hereafter the one way or the other, &s;hould it come judicially before me.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution has declared that the three departments of government &s;hould be &s;eparate and di&s;tinct.&mdash;There are great political evils which would ari&s;e from their union:&mdash; for example, if according to Monte&s;quieu, the members of the legi&s;lature were al&s;o members of the judiciary, the &s;ame man would as a legi&s;lator make a tyrannical law, and then as a judge would enforce it tyrannically.&mdash;This union it is evident would produce a complete de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>It is therefore a fundamental principle not only of our con&s;titution, but acknowledged by all intelligent writers, to be e&s;&s;ential to liberty, that &s;uch an union &s;hould not take place.</P>
<P>But is there any great political evil re&s;ulting from the &s;ame per&s;ons being a judge in chancery, and of the gene|ral court?</P>
<P>Is there any con&s;titutional impediment?&mdash;It would be wi&s;e in the legi&s;lature to keep the offices &s;eparate; for an union of &s;everal functions in one per&s;on, will put it out of his power to be perfect in either, and the commonwealth will be better &s;erved by dividing than by accumulating the public duties.</P>
<P>But it has been &s;aid, and I confe&s;s with great force, that in as much as the judges in chancery are to be tried, on impeachment, before the general court, if the judges of the general court are al&s;o judges in chancery, they in their latter character mu&s;t be tried before them&s;elves in their former, and con&s;equently there will be a defect of an impartial tribunal. I can only an&s;wer this objection by &s;aying, that the former court of appeals was compo&s;ed of the judges of the general court, court in chancery, and admiralty.&mdash;The legi&s;lature might have &s;o organized the
<PB N="22" REF="027777_0020_0FD63DD1801C61A0">
<HI>&s;aid Courts</HI> as to have had nine-tenths of the court of ap|peals members of the general court.</P>
<P>The judges of the general court are by the con&s;titution to be tried before the court of appeals, i. e. <HI>under that or|ganization,</HI> before them&s;elves;&mdash;and the judges of appeals before the general court, which would produce the &s;ame dilemma.</P>
<P>This ca&s;e then is preci&s;ely &s;imilar to the ca&s;e before us.&mdash; And yet the judges of the court of appeals did in the re|mon&s;trance of May, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and eighty eight, declare <Q>that the forming the court of ap|peals, &s;o as to con&s;i&s;t of all the judges is <HI>no violation</HI> of the con&s;titution;</Q> thereby over-ruling the objection which mu&s;t have occurred in that ca&s;e as will as in this.</P>
<P>Upon the whole I mu&s;t &s;ay, that however inconvenient and unwi&s;e it might be to unite the&s;e di&s;tinct offices in the &s;ame per&s;on;&mdash;however in the ca&s;e that has been &s;uppo&s;ed, there might be a defect of an impartial, tribunal to try an offending chancellor upon an impeachment;&mdash;&s;till not &s;ee|ing any expre&s;s provi&s;ion in, or fundamental principle of, the con&s;titution, re&s;tricting the power of the legi&s;lature in this re&s;pect; and grounding my&s;elf upon the above recited opinion of the former court of appeals as to the con&s;tituti|onality of the union of offices which then exi&s;ted in that body;&mdash;My pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ions are, that there is no con&s;titutional impediment, plainly apparent, again&s;t uniting the two offices in the &s;ame per&s;on.</P>

<HEAD>JUDGE HENRY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is an adjourned ca&s;e from the Dumfries Di&s;trict, and the que&s;tion <HI>(new and difficult)</HI> referred to this court is, &mdash;Ought the di&s;trict judges to exerci&s;e that branch of
<PB N="23" REF="027777_0021_0FD63DD2F3CE67C8">
chancery juri&s;diction committed to them by the la&s;t di&s;trict law, of hearing and deciding all cau&s;es brought before them by injunction according to the rules pre&s;cribed by law for conducting &s;imilar &s;uits in the high court of chan|cery.</P>
<P>The difficulty and novelty of this ca&s;e is, that the law in que&s;tion requires of the common law judges, to exerci&s;e chancery juri&s;diction, and that without a legal appoint|ment, and without a commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this &s;ubject is no le&s;s delicate than it is important.&mdash;It is important as it brings in que&s;tion the rights of the legi&s;lature on one of the particular &s;ubjects committed to them by the plan of government: It is de|licate, as the judges are compelled to examine their pow|ers, their duties, and the regularity of their appointments, and therefore, they may be con&s;idered, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, as judges in their own cau&s;e.&mdash;But be the &s;ubject as delicate as can be &s;uppo&s;ed po&s;&s;ible, and as important as any which can ever come before a court, it is now before us, and I embrace the opportunity, now offered me for the fir&s;t time, of publicly declaring my opinion.</P>
<P>The importance of the &s;ubject requires a particular at|tention, and thorough examination. We will then have recour&s;e to the revolution and &s;ome of the hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>In the year 1776, the people of this country cho&s;e depu|ties, to meet in general convention, to con&s;ult of, and take care for, their mo&s;t valuable intere&s;ts. The&s;e deputies &s;eem to have been complete repre&s;entatives of the people, and ve&s;ted with the mo&s;t unlimited authority. According|ly, having taken a careful review of the &s;tate of their country, they found a number of in&s;tances of mi&s;rule in the then exi&s;ting government, and that our prince by abandon|ing the helm of government, and declaring the people to be out of his allegiance and protection, had produced a to|tal di&s;&s;olution of the &s;ocial band.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="027777_0022_0FD63DD4B7D384E8">When this was found to be our unhappy &s;ituation, our deputies proceeded, (as of right they might), to prepare that form of government for us they judged be&s;t.</P>
<P>Accordingly, a plan of government was agreed upon, pro|mulged, and accepted by the people, which has been uni|formly acquie&s;ced under from that day to this time.&mdash;But previous to the promulging the plan of government, the&s;e deputies declared that certain rights were inherent in the people, which the public &s;ervants who might be intru&s;ted with the execution or this government, were never to be permitted to infringe&mdash;for example&mdash;the legi&s;lative branch were declared to be re&s;trained from interfering, with the right of trial by jury in criminal ca&s;es; from meddling with the rights of con&s;cience, in matters of religion, and each of the three branches into which the government was to be divided was declared incompetent to any of the duties of either of the other two.</P>
<P>The judiciary, from the nature of the office, and the mode of their appointment, could never be de&s;igned to de|termine upon the equity, nece&s;&s;ity, or u&s;efulne&s;s of a law; that would amount to an expre&s;s interfering with the legi|&s;lative branch, in the clau&s;e where it is expre&s;sly forbidden for any one branch to interfere with the duties of the other. The rea&s;on is obvious, not being cho&s;en immediately by the people, nor being accountable to them, in the fir&s;t in|&s;tance, they do not, and ought not, to repre&s;ent the people in framing or repealing any law.</P>
<P>There is a propo&s;ition which I take to be univer&s;ally true in our con&s;titution, which to gentlemen who&s;e ideas of parliament, and parliamentary powers were formed under the former government, may not be always obvious&mdash;'tis this&mdash;We were taught that <HI>Parliament</HI> was <HI>omnipotent,</HI> and their powers beyond control; now this propo&s;ition, in our con&s;titution, is limited, and certain rights are re&s;erved as before ob&s;erved;&mdash;if this were always kept in mind, it
<PB N="25" REF="027777_0023_0FD63DD7E7CC08B8">
might free the mind from a good deal of embarra&s;&s;ment in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing &s;everal que&s;tions where the duty, and the power of the legi&s;lature is con&s;idered.</P>
<P>Our deputies, in this famous convention, after having re&s;erved many fundamental rights to the people, which were declared not to be &s;ubject to legi&s;lative control, did more;&mdash;they pointed out a certain and permanent mode of appointing the officers who were to be intru&s;ted with the execution of the government.&mdash;Though the choice of the officers was intru&s;ted to the wi&s;dom of the legi&s;lature, yet the manner of conducting this choice was fixed; hereby declaring in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, the public will and mind of the people to be, that the laws, when made, &s;hould be executed by officers cho&s;en and appointed, as therein is directed, and not otherwi&s;e, whereas under the former go|vernment, the legi&s;lature &s;eemed to have had no bounds to their authority but the negative of the crown, and the public officers were appointed and di&s;placed at the plea|&s;ure of the governing powers which then were.</P>
<P>I come now to the particular ca&s;e before the court. Kamper applied to the di&s;trict court of Dumfries, for an injunction to a judgment obtained at law in that court by Hawkins, under the law which directs the di&s;trict judges to hear and determine all &s;uits commencing by injunction, under the &s;ame rules and regulations as are now pre&s;crib|ed by law, for conducting &s;imilar &s;uits in the high court of chancery.</P>
<P>The permanent will of the people, expre&s;&s;ed in the con&s;titution, is that the legi&s;lature, by joint ballot of both hou&s;es, &s;hall appoint judges of the &s;upreme court of appeals and general court, judges in chancery, &amp;c. to be commi&s;|&s;ioned by the governor, and to hold their offices during good behavior.</P>
<P>'Tis alledged by &s;ome of my brethren, that the legi&s;la|ture are not warranted in appointing the &s;ame men to be
<PB N="26" REF="027777_0024_0FD63DDB7AEE1EE0">
judges both at common law and in chancery. The words of the plan of government are, <Q>they &s;hall appoint judges of the high court of appeals and general court, judges in chancery, &amp;c.</Q>&mdash;The&s;e words, <HI>Judges in Chancery,</HI> are &s;uppo&s;ed to de&s;ign different per&s;ons from the judges of the general court, and an argument to inforce this opini|on is drawn from &sect; 16 and 17, where it is provided, that any judge of the general court, offending again&s;t the &s;tate, may be pro&s;ecuted in the high court of appeals; but a chancery judge offending mu&s;t be pro&s;ecuted in the gene|ral court; therefore it is alledged, a common law judge cannot be a chancery, nor a chancery a common law judge in our government.</P>
<P>This que&s;tion has heretofore been alledged as one of the rea&s;ons of the high court of appeals for declining to execute a very important law of the land;&mdash;without &s;aying any thing about the propriety or impropriety of that bu&s;ine&s;s, it is &s;ufficient for my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to ob&s;erve, that the que&s;tion did not then come before the court in a judicial manner,&mdash;it was taken up as a general propo&s;ition, and when publi&s;hed, contained an appeal to the people; this looked like a di&s;&s;olution of the government,&mdash;therefore I cannot view it as an adjudged ca&s;e, to be con&s;idered as a binding precedent.</P>
<P>It is much to be wi&s;hed that the que&s;tion had been then decided, by calling a convention of the people.&mdash;But unfor|tunately the legi&s;lature neither yielded the point nor in&s;i&s;t|ed, but adopted an expedient.&mdash;They new-modelled the courts.&mdash;The que&s;tion then went to &s;leep, but the legi&s;la|ture pre&s;erved the principle; they appointed judges of the high court of appeals, with unlimited juri&s;diction, both in law and equity; they appointed judges of the general court, and a judge in chancery.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="027777_0025_0FD63DDD77FA94E8">If the common law and chancery juri&s;diction ought not to be united in the &s;ame per&s;ons in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, I do not &s;ee how it can be ju&s;tified in the appellate juri&s;diction.&mdash; If the form of government has provided that ju&s;tice at common law ought to be admini&s;tered by one &s;et of men, and in chancery by another, it &s;eems to me to follow as a nece&s;&s;ary inference, that the appellate, as well as the ori|ginal juri&s;diction, ought to be &s;eparate and di&s;tinct, and that tho&s;e gentlemen who now exerci&s;e the appellate ju|ri&s;diction have admitted the legi&s;lative con&s;truction of the form of government formerly objected to.</P>
<P>But I do not re&s;t the que&s;tion on this ground. Where I am not bound by regular adjudications of the &s;uperior court, I cannot re&s;t on other men's opinions. I mu&s;t and will think for my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Our government is declared to be founded on the autho|rity of the people. The people, in convention, have or|dered that a legi&s;lature &s;hall be cho&s;en, a governor and council &s;hall be cho&s;en, judges &s;hall be appointed.&mdash;All the&s;e different characters are &s;ervants of the people, have different duties, and are amenable to them. When the legi&s;lature were intru&s;ted with the appointment of judges, I can find no particular characters, or any de&s;cription of men, declared to be ineligible, but tho&s;e holding legi&s;lative or executive authority, who are forbidden to interfere. To the di&s;cretion of the legi&s;lature is committed the choice of the judges, who &s;hall fill all the &s;uperior courts, and there|fore, if they have cho&s;en, or &s;hall hereafter chu&s;e to ap|point the &s;ame &s;et of men to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice to the peo|ple, both at common law and in chancery, I cannot find any thing in the form of government to re&s;train them.&mdash; They are to appoint judges in chancery at their di&s;creti|on;&mdash;and for me to &s;ay I cannot act as a chancery judge in any ca&s;e, becau&s;e if I &s;hould offend, I am to be pro&s;e|cuted
<PB N="28" REF="027777_0026_0FD63DDEF160F208">
for &s;uch offence before my brethren in the general court, &s;eems to be a &s;trange rea&s;on for me to a&s;&s;ign for declining the office.</P>
<P>I am therefore very clear and decided in my opinion, that the legi&s;lature were fully authori&s;ed by the form of government, to appoint the di&s;trict judges to exerci&s;e a chancery juri&s;diction in the ca&s;e before us, and I do chearfully embrace this public opportunity of declaring my hearty approbation of the mea&s;ure, and my willingne&s;s to act when the appointment is regularly made.</P>
<P>This brings me to the &s;econd point in the ca&s;e. Have the legi&s;lature made the appointment in the manner pre|&s;cribed by the form of government?&mdash;</P>
<P>I wi&s;h mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly I could give an affirmative an&s;wer to this que&s;tion. 'Tis provided by the form of go|vernment, &s;o often alluded to, that judges in chancery &s;hall be cho&s;en by joint ballot of both hou&s;es, &s;hall be commi&s;&s;ioned by the governor, &s;hall hold their of|fice during good behaviour, and to &s;ecure their inde|pendence and remove them from all temptation to corrup|tion, their &s;alaries &s;hall be adequate and fixed.&mdash;If a chan|cellor in any ca&s;e mu&s;t be cho&s;en by ballot, be commi&s;&s;ion|ed and hold his office during good behavior, &s;urely it is proper, it is nece&s;&s;ary in all ca&s;es, that every judge &s;hall be &s;o cho&s;en, &s;hall be &s;o commi&s;&s;ioned, and hold his office &s;o long as he behaves well.&mdash;The bu&s;ine&s;s of hearing cau&s;es originating in that court by injunction, is of a per|manent nature.&mdash;To exerci&s;e this duty without the ap|pointment and commi&s;&s;ion pre&s;cribed by the con&s;titution, would be an exerci&s;e of a power according to the will of the legi&s;lature, who are &s;ervants of the people, not only with|out, but expre&s;sly again&s;t the will of the people.&mdash;This would be a &s;oleci&s;m in government,&mdash;e&s;tabli&s;hing the will of the legi&s;lature, &s;ervants of the people, to control the
<PB N="29" REF="027777_0027_0FD63DE1F78418E0">
will of their ma&s;ters, if the word may be permitted.&mdash; 'Till the appointment is made agreeable to the directions of the con&s;titution, I cannot think my&s;elf duly authori&s;ed to take upon me the office.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I wi&s;h to embrace the pre&s;ent oppor|tunity of &s;aying &s;omething about what may be called incon|&s;i&s;tency in my conduct.&mdash;'Tis well known I &s;at in the for|mer court of appeals, not being particularly balloted for and commi&s;&s;ioned. I have latterly obeyed the commands of the legi&s;lature, by &s;itting in the &s;pecial court of appeals without any &s;uch appointment or commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>When I was appointed a judge of the court of admiralty there was a &s;tanding law of the land, that every &s;uch judge &s;hould of cour&s;e be a judge of the court of appeals, and an oath of office in both courts was pre&s;cribed. When I was ballotted for, I con&s;idered my&s;elf as having a general ap|pointment to both the courts, and acted accordingly: and had a commi&s;&s;ion been applied for as a judge of the court of appeals, 'tis probable, it might have been granted. How|ever, the legi&s;lature, on reviewing this &s;ubject, availing them&s;elves of what was then in their opinion judged to be an incomplete appointment, thought them&s;elves authori&s;ed to garble the commi&s;&s;ion, and di&s;mi&s;s one half of the judges, without either giving them notice, or a&s;&s;igning any rea&s;on, a&s;&s;uming a right from their own omi&s;&s;ion, if it was one, to di&s;mi&s;s their judges.&mdash;If the legi&s;lature were autho|ri&s;ed to take this &s;tep at that time, it &s;urely furni&s;hes all &s;ucceeding judges, as they value their reputation and their independence, to &s;ee that their appointment be regular, before entering upon the duties of their office, in future.</P>
<P>This di&s;mi&s;&s;ion was &s;ubmitted to, though, in a &s;hort time afterwards, the legi&s;lature &s;eem to have forgotten the prin|ciple on which they grounded the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the judges; for when public convenience &s;eemed to require a &s;pecial court of appeals, in ca&s;es where a majority of the judges of
<PB N="30" REF="027777_0028_0FD63DE3F80CF020">
that court &s;hould be intere&s;ted, they commanded the judges of the general court to attend in &s;uch &s;pecial court, with|out either an appointment or commi&s;&s;ion, which command I have more than once obeyed: and I freely acknowledge, that I con&s;ider this &s;pecial court, with re&s;pect to me, who have been neither appointed nor commi&s;&s;ioned &s;ince the pa&s;&s;ing of that law, as uncon&s;titutional; but it is tempo|rary.&mdash;The ca&s;e cannot often happen; 'tis exceedingly di&s;agreeable to be faulting the legi&s;lature; and, perhaps, one particular mi&s;chief had better be &s;ubmitted to, than a public inconvenience.&mdash;The&s;e were my rea&s;ons for &s;itting in this &s;pecial court.</P>
<P>It is mo&s;t devoutly to be wi&s;hed, that the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, now become the topic of public, di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, may be fully and generally under&s;tood, by the legi&s;lature, by the judiciary, and by the public at large, that there be no more of the&s;e unhappy differences of opinion between any of the different departments of government.</P>
<P>It remains only for me to add that where I have been appointed and commi&s;&s;ioned, I obey with alacrity  when a new appointment &s;hall be made, and a commi&s;&s;ion be di|rected, authori&s;ing me to exerci&s;e the office of a judge in chancery, in any ca&s;e whatever, I &s;hall then have it in my power to exerci&s;e the right of every other free man,&mdash;to accept or refu&s;e,&mdash;though I have no difficulty in declaring, were the appointment perfect, that I might hold during good behaviour, I &s;hould have no objection to enter upon the di&s;charge of the&s;e new duties;&mdash;but until that is done, in ju&s;tice to the public, who&s;e rights are concerned, and to my&s;elf, as an individual, I mu&s;t decline the duty pre&s;cribed by the law in que&s;tion, not being as yet &s;uch a judge in chancery as the people have &s;aid &s;hall exerci&s;e that kind of juri&s;diction.</P>

<P>I am &s;aved much trouble in the inve&s;tigation of this ca&s;e by the gentlemen who&s;e opinions have been already deli|vered with &s;o much propriety and &s;ound rea&s;on, as it re|&s;pects the que&s;tion of the validity of the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>It is truly painful to me to be under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ay|ing any thing in &s;upport of it at this day; but &s;ince I am reduced to this nece&s;&s;ity, I mu&s;t be indulged with a few ob&s;ervations on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I know it has been the opinion of &s;ome critical and &s;pe|culative gentlemen of con&s;iderable merit and abilities too, that one form of government was not authori&s;ed by the people; ina&s;much as no in&s;tructions were given by the peo|ple to the convention at the time the Con&s;titution was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.</P>
<P>To inve&s;tigate this &s;ubject rightly, we need but go back to that awful period of our country when we were declar|ed out of the protection of the then mother country&mdash;and take a retro&s;pective view of our &s;ituation, and behold the bands of civil government cut a&s;under, and de&s;troyed&mdash;No &s;ocial compact, no &s;y&s;tem of protection and common defence again&s;t an invading tyrant&mdash;In a &s;tate of nature, without friends, allies, or re&s;ources&mdash;In &s;uch a ca&s;e what was to be done?</P>
<P>Tho&s;e eminent characters to whom &s;o much gratitude is, and for ever will be due; who&s;e names are enrolled in the

annals of America, recommended a convention of delegates to be cho&s;en for that purpo&s;e; who were to meet together for the expre&s;s de&s;ign of completely protecting and defend|ing the rights, both civil and religious, of our common coun|try.&mdash;The delegates were &s;o elected and convened.&mdash;What power had the people therefore that was not confided to their repre&s;entatives? All their rights, all their power, all their happine&s;s, all their hopes and pro&s;pects of &s;ucce&s;s, were mo&s;t indubitably entru&s;ted to their care.&mdash;They were not betrayed.&mdash;The people did not &s;ay to their repre&s;enta|tives, So far &s;hall ye go, and no farther.&mdash;Happy, indeed, for this country, that no &s;uch re&s;traint was laid on them.</P>
<P>In order to protect and defend the common cau&s;e then, a &s;y&s;tem of &s;ocial duties were formed.&mdash;Without this what obedience could have been expected, and how could a re|gular defence have been made?</P>
<P>A great variety of departments were e&s;tabli&s;hed, and tho&s;e who were to execute them mu&s;t have been made re|&s;pon&s;ible to &s;ome regular power&mdash;And all this was to com|plete the great work of liberty.</P>
<P>Has not this policy been &s;ufficiently ratified by time and action?

And &s;hall its validity be now que&s;|tioned? for what purpo&s;e? to revert back to our former in&s;ignificancy? It cannot be.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to &s;ay any thing on the adjourned ca&s;e now under contemplation, I will beg leave to make a few ob&s;ervations on the opinion that &s;ome gentlemen have ta|ken up of the impropriety of the judiciary in deciding again&s;t a law which is in contradiction to the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>A little time and trouble be&s;towed on this &s;ubject, I am &s;ure, would enable any per&s;on, endowed with common under&s;tanding, to &s;ee the fallacy of &s;uch &s;entiments.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="027777_0031_0FD63DEBCAAAAEB0">What is the Con&s;titution but the great contract of the people, every individual whereof having &s;worn allegiance to it?&mdash;A &s;y&s;tem of fundamental principles, the violation of which mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a crime of the highe&s;t mag|nitude.&mdash;That this great and paramount law &s;hould be faithfully and rightfully executed, it is divided into three departments, to wit; the legi&s;lative, the executive, and judiciary, with an expre&s;s re&s;traint upon all, &s;o that nei|ther &s;hall encroach on the rights of the other.&mdash;In the Bill of Rights many things are laid down, which are re&s;erved to the people&mdash;trial by jury, on life and death; liberty of con&s;cience, &amp;c. Can the legi&s;lature rightfully pa&s;s a law taking away the&s;e rights from the people? Can the judi|ciary pa&s;s &s;entence without a conviction of a citizen by twelve of his peers? Can the executive do any thing for|bidden by this bill of rights, or the con&s;titution? In &s;hort, can one branch of the government call upon another to aid in the violation of this &s;acred letter? The an&s;wer to the&s;e que&s;tions mu&s;t be in the negative.</P>
<P>But who is to judge of this matter? the legi&s;lature only?

of the court and revenue, amba&s;&s;adors, mini&s;ters, and privy-coun&s;ellors, are all &s;ubordinate in their end to this part of admini&s;tration.</Q>&mdash;Hence it may rea&s;on|ably be inferred that if the commonwealth it&s;elf is &s;ubordi|nate to this department of government at times, &s;o there|fore will nece&s;&s;arily be the acts of the legi&s;lature, when they &s;hall be found to violate fir&s;t principles, notwith&s;tanding the &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>"omnipotence of parliament,"</HI> which is an abo|minable in&s;ult upon the honour and good &s;en&s;e of our coun|try, as nothing is omnipotent as it relates to us, either re|ligious or political, but the <HI>God of Heaven</HI> and our con&s;titu|tion!</P>
<P>I will not in an extra-judicial manner a&s;&s;ume the right to negative a law, for this would be as dangerous as the exam|ple before us; but if by any legal means I have juri&s;diction of a cau&s;e, in which it is made a que&s;tion how far the law be a violation of the con&s;titution, and therefore of no obliga|tion, I &s;hall not &s;hrink from a compari&s;on of the two, and pronounce &s;entence as my mind may receive conviction.&mdash; To be made an agent, therefore, for the purpo&s;e of violat|ing the con&s;titution, I cannot con&s;ent to.&mdash;As a citizen I &s;hould complain of it; as a public &s;ervant, filling an office in one of the great departments of government, I &s;hould be a traitor to my country to do it. But the violation mu&s;t be plain and clear, or there might be danger of the judiciary preventing the operation of laws which might be productive of much public good. The&s;e premi&s;es being admitted, as I think they mu&s;t, I will now draw a compari&s;on of the law before us with the con&s;titution. The con&s;titution declares there &s;hall be judges in chancery, judges of the general court, &amp;c. &amp;c. and the fir&s;t que&s;tion that occurs is this&mdash; Can the office of a judge in chancery and common law be rightfully ve&s;ted in the &s;ame per&s;ons, provided the appoint|ment be regular?&mdash;To which I an&s;wer, I &s;ee no incompati|bility,
<PB N="35" REF="027777_0033_0FD63DF2B726D1F8">
in the exerci&s;e of the&s;e offices, by the &s;ame per&s;ons &mdash;for although they be di&s;tinct offices, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing di&s;tinct powers, they do not nece&s;&s;arily blend and run together, becau&s;e they are placed in the &s;ame hands. The judge who knows the powers and duties of both, will well know how to keep them apart&mdash;like the rays of the &s;un, they radiate from one common centre, and may run parallel for ever, without an interference.&mdash;But to this, an ingenius and &s;ubtile argument is offered, and taken from the 17th article of the con&s;titution, wherein it is directed, that when the judges of the general court are impeached, the court of appeals &s;hall &s;et in judgment&mdash;but all other officers of go|vernment, &s;hall be impeached before the general court. Therefore, the con&s;titution meant to keep the offices di&s;|tinct, in di&s;tinct hands, becau&s;e it is po&s;&s;ible that they may try one another, and perhaps form a combination, in favour of the fraternity. This is too nice a deduction, and is a better argument in favour of an amendment of the con&s;ti|tution, than of the que&s;tion under con&s;ideration. We can|not &s;upply defects; nor can we reconcile ab&s;urdities, if any there be; this mu&s;t be done by the people; and were we about the bu&s;ine&s;s of amendments duly authori&s;ed, it might be well to con&s;ider this point.&mdash;But I cannot &s;ee why a judge in chancery, if he be a judge al&s;o of the general court, may not be tried by the court of appeals; for if he be convicted of &s;uch a crime, as he ought to be di&s;placed office in either capacity, he would hardly be allowed to hold the other&mdash;nor do I &s;ee why the judges of the general court, cannot try their brothers in chancery.</P>
<P>The Legi&s;lature having a knowledge of this ca&s;e, cho&s;e to tru&s;t the powers in our hands, as in the ca&s;e of the high court of appeals who po&s;&s;e&s;s both chancery and common law powers, and are yet impeachable before the general court, who ought not to have a &s;tronger &s;ympathy or fellow-feel|ing

for each other than for all the judges. In this ca&s;e we find the &s;ame po&s;&s;ible inconvenience, but it is barely po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e that ju&s;tice and the law will not be the object of a court's deci&s;ion let who will be the culprit, or object of trial&mdash;we find the county courts po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e powers, and I do &s;uppo&s;e, if the doctrine contended for, on this point, was &s;ound, they would not have been &s;uffered to have re&s;ted from the beginning of the revolution to this day, in tho&s;e courts, and without arrogating much to our&s;elves we may be allowed to hope the tru&s;t would be at lea&s;t as well executed, in our hands.&mdash;I have nothing to &s;ay with re&s;pect to the policy of the mea&s;ure, that will &s;peak for it&s;elf; and moreover, it belongs to the legi&s;lature to decide.</P>
<P>The next inquiry we are to make, brings us pointedly to the compari&s;on of the law now under contemplation, and the con&s;titution, and how does it &s;tand? the con&s;titu|tion &s;ays that judges in chancery &s;hall be appointed by joint ballot of both hou&s;es of a&s;&s;embly, and commi&s;&s;ioned by the governor during good behaviour&mdash;and for the mo&s;t valua|ble purpo&s;es; to &s;ecure the independence of the judiciary. &mdash;Contrary to this expre&s;s direction, which admits of no doubt, implication or nice con&s;truction, that bane to poli|tical freedom, the legi&s;lature has made the appointment by an act mandatory, to the judges, leaving them not at liber|ty to accept or refu&s;e the office conferred, which is a right every citizen enjoys, in every other ca&s;e&mdash;a right too &s;acred to be yielded to any power on earth&mdash;but, were I willing to do it as it relates to my&s;elf, as a judge I ought not; be|cau&s;e it would fru&s;trate that mo&s;t important object before-mentioned&mdash;intended by the con&s;titution to be kept &s;acred, for the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of purpo&s;es&mdash;to wit, that ju&s;tice and the law be done to all manner of per&s;ons without fear or reward.&mdash;</P>

Let me now compare the law and the con&s;titution in the other point; that of the want of a commi&s;&s;ion during good behaviour, and the rea&s;ons will fully or forcibly apply&mdash; when I receive the commi&s;&s;ion, I &s;ee the ground on which I &s;tand.

<P>It will be remembered, by all tho&s;e who are conver&s;ant with the hi&s;tory of the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of the late glorious revolution, that the mea&s;ures which led to the final con|&s;ummation of that important event, although they origi|nated, in mo&s;t in&s;tances, with the legal and con&s;titutional a&s;&s;emblies of the different colonies, made but a &s;mall pro|gre&s;s in that channel, particularly in this &s;tate. The di&s;|&s;olution of the con&s;titutional A&s;&s;emblies, by the governors appointed by the crown, obliged the people to re&s;ort to other methods of deliberating for the common good.&mdash; Hence the fir&s;t introduction of conventions: bodies neither authorized by; or known to the then con&s;titutional govern|ment; bodies, on the contrary, which the con&s;titutional officers of the then exi&s;ting governments con&s;idered as ille|gal, and treated as &s;uch. Neverthele&s;s, they met, delibe|rated, and re&s;olved for the <HI>common good.</HI> They were the <HI>people,</HI> a&s;&s;embled by their deputies; not a <HI>legal,</HI> or <HI>con&s;titu|tional a&s;&s;embly,</HI> or <HI>part</HI> of the <HI>government</HI> as then organiz|ed.&mdash;Hence they were not, nor could be deemed the ordi|nary legi&s;lature; that body being compo&s;ed of the gover|nor, council, and burge&s;&s;es: who &s;at in <HI>&s;everal di&s;tinct chambers,</HI> and <HI>characters:</HI> while the other was compo&s;ed of a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> body, having neither the character of governor, council, or legitimate repre&s;entative among them: they were, in effect, <HI>the people them&s;elves,</HI> a&s;&s;embled by their de|legates, to whom the care of the commonwealth was e&s;pe|cially, as well as unboundedly confided.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="027777_0039_0FD63DFAC022AB00">To prove this di&s;tinction &s;till farther. The power of convening the <HI>legal</HI> a&s;&s;emblies, or the ordinary con&s;titutional legi&s;lature, re&s;ided &s;olely in the executive: they could nei|ther be cho&s;en without writs i&s;&s;ued by it's authority, nor a&s;&s;emble when cho&s;en, but under the &s;ame authority. The conventions, on the contrary, were cho&s;en, and a&s;&s;embled, either in pur&s;uance of recommendations from Congre&s;s, or from their own bodies, or by the di&s;cretion, and common con&s;ent of the people. They were held, even whil&s;t a legal a&s;&s;embly exi&s;ted. Witne&s;s the convention, held in Richmond in March, 1775: after which period, the legal, or con&s;titutional a&s;&s;embly was convened in William&s;burgh, by the governor, lord Dunmore; and continued fixting until finally di&s;&s;olved by him in June or July 1775.&mdash;No other legal a&s;&s;embly was ever cho&s;en, or convened under the Briti&s;h government.</P>
<P>The convention then was not the ordinary legi&s;lature of Virginia. It was the body of the people, impelled to a&s;|&s;emble from a &s;en&s;e of common danger, con&s;ulting for the common good, and acting in all things for the common &s;afety. It could not be the legitimate legi&s;lature, under the then e&s;tabli&s;hed government, &s;ince that body could only be cho&s;en under the permi&s;&s;ion, and a&s;&s;embled under the authority of the crown of Great Britain.</P>
<P>But although the exerci&s;e of the authority of the excu|tive government under the crown of Great Britain cea&s;ed altogether with the di&s;&s;olution of that a&s;&s;embly in June 1775, yet a con&s;titutional dependence on the Briti&s;h government, was never denied, until the &s;ucceeding May, nor di&s;&s;olved un|til the moment of adopting the pre&s;ent con&s;titution, or form of government; an event, which took effect by the <HI>unanimous voice</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ord. of Conv.

of the convention, (elected after the final di&s;&s;olution of the ge|neral a&s;&s;embly, is above-mentioned, and a&s;&s;embled in William&s;|burgh,) on the 29th of June 1776, after &s;ix weeks deliberation thereon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The convention came to a re&s;olution to in&s;truct their delegates in Congre&s;s to move that body to declare America independent on the <HI>15</HI>th of May, <HI>1776,</HI> and the <HI>&s;ame day</HI> appointed a committee to prepare the draught of the <HI>new con&s;titution,</HI> or <HI>form of government.</HI> See the journals of the convention a&s;&s;embled in William&s;burgh, May <HI>1776.</HI></NOTE>, and eight days before the declaration of independ|ence, by the Congre&s;s of the United States.

<P>It &s;eems to me an ob&s;ervation of great importance, that the <HI>declaration of independence</HI> by <HI>this &s;tate,</HI> was <HI>fir&s;t made</HI> in that in&s;trument which <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hes our con&s;titution.</HI> The in&s;tant that the declaration of independence took effect, had the convention proceeded no further, the government, as formerly exerci&s;ed by the crown of Great Britain, being thereby totally di&s;&s;olved, there would neither have been an ordinary legi&s;lature, nor any other organized body, or au|thority in Virginia. Every man would have been utterly ab&s;olved from every &s;ocial tie, and remitted to a perfect &s;tate of nature. But a power to demoli&s;h the exi&s;ting fa|bric of government, which no one will, I pre&s;ume, at this day, deny to that convention, without authority to erect a new one, could never be pre&s;umed. A new organization
<PB N="43" REF="027777_0041_0FD63DFF72004EE8">
of the fabric, and a new arrangement of the powers of go|vernment, mu&s;t in&s;tantly take place, to prevent the&s;e evils which the ab&s;ence of government mu&s;t infallibly produce in any ca&s;e; but more e&s;pecially under circum&s;tances &s;o aw|ful, and pro&s;pects &s;o threatening, as tho&s;e which &s;urround|ed the people of America, at that alarming period. Is would therefore have been ab&s;urdity in the extreme, in the people of Virginia, to authorize the convention to ab|&s;olve them from the bonds of one government, without the power to unite them under any other, at a time when the utmo&s;t exertions of government were required to pre|&s;erve both their liberties and their lives: but &s;ince they are <HI>both</HI> in <HI>form,</HI> and <HI>effect</HI> only <HI>different clau&s;es of the &s;ame act,</HI> and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of each other, to que&s;tion the validity of the one, is to deny of the effect of the other.

<P>Here let me cite the opinion of an eminent lawyer on the one hand, and of an enlightened politician on the others on the &s;ubject of two national revolutions, the mo&s;t fami|liar to us of any, except our own.</P>
<P><Q>The revolution of 1688, &s;ays judge Black&s;tone, 1 Corn. 211, was not a defeazance of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and a new limitation of the crown by the king, and both hou&s;es of parliament: it was the act of the nation alone, upon the conviction that there was no king in being.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The national a&s;&s;embly of France, &s;ays the ingenious M'Kinto&s;h, p. 60. was a&s;&s;embled as an ordinary legi&s;la|ture under exi&s;ting laws. They were transformed by events into a national convention, and ve&s;ted with powers to organize a new government. It is in vain that their adver&s;aries conte&s;t this a&s;&s;ertion by appealing to the defi|ciency of forms. It is in vain to demand the legal in|&s;trument that changed their con&s;titution, and extended
<PB N="44" REF="027777_0042_0FD63E02749B4900">
their powers. Accurate forms in the conveyance of power are pre&s;cribed by the wi&s;dom of the law, in the regular admini&s;tration of &s;tates. But great revolutions are too Immen&s;e for technical formality. All the &s;anc|tion that can be hoped from &s;uch events is the voice of the people, however informally and irregularly expre&s;|&s;ed.</Q> (Def. of Fr. Revo. 60.)</P>
<P>Our ca&s;e was much &s;tronger than either of tho&s;e. There was at lea&s;t the &s;hadow of legal, con&s;titutional authority in the convention parliament of England in 1688, as the ordi|nary legi&s;lature, and the national a&s;&s;embly of France, was con&s;titutionally a&s;&s;embled under the authority of the go|vernment it &s;ubverted. The convention of Virginia had not the &s;hadow of a legal, or con&s;titutional form about it. It derived it's exi&s;tence and authority from a higher &s;ource; a power which can &s;uper&s;ede all law, and annul the con&s;ti|tution it&s;elf&mdash;namely, the <HI>people,</HI> in their <HI>&s;overeign, unlimit|ed,</HI> and <HI>unlimitable</HI> authority and capacity.</P>
<P>From what I have &s;aid, I am inclined to hope, that it will appear that our con&s;titution was not the act of the or|dinary legi&s;lature: a few words concerning it's operation&punc; authority, and effect, as the act of the people, may not be improper.</P>
<P><Q>A con&s;titution, &s;ays the celebrated Paine, is not a thing in name only, but in fact. It has not an ideal, but a real exi&s;tence; and wherever it cannot be produced in a vi&s;ible form, there is none. A con&s;titution is a thing antecedent to government, and a government is only the creature of a con&s;titution. It is not the act of the government, but of the people con&s;tituting a government. It is the body of elements to which you can refer, and quote article by article, and which contains the prin|ciples on which the government &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed, the
<PB N="45" REF="027777_0043_0FD63E071DD24318">
manner in which it &s;hall be organized, the powers it &s;hall have, &amp;c. See Rights of Man, part I. p. 30.</Q></P>
<P>Vattel, in treating of the fundamental laws of a &s;tate, ob&s;erves, <Q>that a nation may entru&s;t the exerci&s;e of the legi&s;lative power to the prince, or to an a&s;&s;embly, or to that a&s;&s;embly and the prince, jointly; who have then a right of making new, and of abrogating old laws. It is here demanded, whether if their power extends as far as the fundamental laws, they may change the con&s;titu|tion of the &s;tate? to this he an&s;wers, we may decide with certainty, that the authority of the&s;e legi&s;lators does not extend &s;o far, and that they ought to con&s;ider the fundamental laws as &s;acred, if the nation has not in <HI>expre&s;s terms given them power to change them.</HI> For the con&s;titution of the &s;tate ought to be fixed; and &s;ince that was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed by the nation, which afterwards tru&s;t|ed certain per&s;ons, with the legi&s;lative powers, the fun|damental laws are excepted from their commi&s;&s;ion. In &s;hort, the&s;e legi&s;lators derive their power from the con|&s;titution: how then can they change it, without de&s;troy|ing the foundation of their authority?</Q> Vattel, p. 31.</P>
<P>That the legi&s;lature of this commonwealth have regard|ed our con&s;titution in this light, will appear from more than one authority. I &s;hall &s;elect the preamble of an act pa&s;&s;ed in May &s;e&s;&s;ion, 1783. c. 32. Rev. Co. 204. entitled an act to amend an act, entitled an act concerning the appoint|ment of &s;heriffs, which recites <Q>that the former act was contrary to the con&s;titution, or form of government,</Q> for which rea&s;on it was repealed.&mdash;A &s;econd in&s;tance may be found in the acts of 1787, c. 23. which recites <Q>that a former act, entitled an act to extend the powers of the governor and council, Rev. Co. 81. appears to the pre|&s;ent general a&s;&s;embly to be contrary to the true &s;pirit of
<PB N="46" REF="027777_0044_0FD63E08DC5F88D8">
the con&s;titution:</Q> wherefore it was repealed.&mdash;Two other in&s;tances may be found, the fir&s;t in the repeal <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1788, <HI>ch.</HI> 67.</NOTE> of the act of 1787, c. 39. for e&s;tabli&s;hing di&s;trict courts, whereby the <HI>judges of the court of appeals</HI> were required to act as <HI>judges of the di&s;trict courts:</HI> the &s;econd, in an act of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, 1792, ch. 28. providing for the republication of the laws of this commonwealth, which directs <Q>that the bill of rights, and con&s;titution, or form of government, &s;hall be prefixed to the code of laws.</Q>&mdash;Other in&s;tances doubt|le&s;s may be found in our laws where the legi&s;lature have either expre&s;sly, or tacitly, recognized the con&s;titution as paramount to their own legi&s;lative acts; &s;o that rea&s;oning, in this in&s;tance, is confirmed by precedent.</P>
<P>But here an objection will no doubt be drawn from the authority of tho&s;e writers who affirm, that the con&s;titution of a &s;tate is a rule to the <HI>legi&s;lature only,</HI> and not to the <HI>ju|diciary,</HI> or the <HI>executive:</HI> the legi&s;lature being bound not to tran&s;gre&s;s it; but that neither the executive nor judi|ciary can re&s;ort to it to enquire whether they do tran&s;gre&s;s it, or not.</P>
<P>This &s;ophi&s;m could never have obtained a moment's cre|dit with the world, had &s;uch a thing as a written con&s;titu|tion exi&s;ted before the American revolution. <Q>All the governments that now exi&s;t in the world, &s;ays a late writer,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">M'Kinto&s;h on the Er. Rev. <HI>155.</HI></NOTE> except the United States of America, have been fortuitou&s;ly formed. They are the produce of chance, not the work of art. They have been altered, impaired, improved, and de&s;troyed, by accidental circum&s;tances, beyond the fore&s;ight or control of wi&s;dom; their parts thrown up again&s;t pre&s;ent emergencies, formed no &s;y&s;te|matic whole.</Q> What the <HI>con&s;titution</HI> of any country <HI>was,</HI> or rather <HI>was &s;uppo&s;ed to be,</HI> could only be collected from what the <HI>government had at any time done;</HI> what had
<PB N="47" REF="027777_0045_0FD63E0ACFA38E28">
been <HI>acquie&s;ced</HI> in by the people, or other component parts of the government; or what had been <HI>re&s;i&s;ted</HI> by either of them. Whatever the government, or any branch of it had <HI>once done,</HI> it was inferred they had a <HI>right</HI> to do <HI>again.</HI> The union of the legi&s;lative and executive powers in the &s;ame men, or body of men, en&s;ured the &s;ucce&s;s of their u&s;urpations; and the judiciary, having no <HI>written con&s;titu|tion</HI> to refer to, were obliged to <HI>receive</HI> whatever <HI>expo&s;i|tion</HI> of if the legi&s;lature might think proper to make.&mdash;But, with us, the con&s;titution is not an <Q>ideal thing, but a real exi&s;tence: it can be produced in a vi&s;ible form:</Q> its principles can be a&s;certained from the living letter, not from ob&s;cure rea&s;oning or deductions only. The govern|ment, therefore, and all its branches mu&s;t be governed by the con&s;titution. Hence it becomes the fir&s;t law of the land, and as &s;uch mu&s;t be re&s;orted to on every occa&s;ion, where it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to expound <HI>what the law is.</HI> This expo&s;ition it is the duty and office of the judiciary to make; our con&s;titution expre&s;sly declaring that the legi&s;la|tive, executive, and judiciary, &s;hall be &s;eparate and di&s;tinct, &s;o that neither exerci&s;e the powers properly belonging to the other.&mdash;Now &s;ince it is the province of the legi&s;lature to make, and of the executive to enforce obedience to the laws, the duty of expounding mu&s;t be exclu&s;ively ve&s;ted in the judiciary.&mdash;But how can any ju&s;t expo&s;ition be made, <HI>if that which is the &s;upreme law of the land be withheld from their view?</HI> Suppo&s;e a que&s;tion had ari&s;en on either of the acts before cited, which the legi&s;lature have di&s;covered to be uncon&s;titutional, would the judiciary have been bound by the act, or by the con&s;titution?</P>
<P>But that the con&s;titution is a rule to all the departments of the government, to the judiciary as well as to the legi&s;|lature, may, I think, be proved by reference to a few parts of it.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="027777_0046_0FD63E0BEEC0F2C8">The bill of rights, art. 8. provides, that in all capital and criminal pro&s;ecutions, the party accu&s;ed &s;hall be tried by a <HI>jury of the vicinage,</HI> and cannot be found guilty without their <HI>unanimous</HI> con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e any future act of the legi&s;lature &s;hould abridge either of the&s;e privileges, what would be &s;aid of a court that &s;hould act in conformity to &s;uch an act?</P>
<P>Again; art. 9. declares that exce&s;&s;ive bail ought not to be required. The act <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1785, <HI>ch.</HI> 80.</NOTE> concerning bail, I apprehend, ex|tends not to the &s;uperior courts; perhaps not even to the county courts. Is this injunction a mere dead letter, be|cau&s;e the legi&s;lature have not yet pa&s;&s;ed a law equally ex|ten&s;ive in its obligation?</P>
<P>Art. 10. declares that general warrants are illegal and oppre&s;&s;ive, and ought not to be granted. Is this too a dead letter, becau&s;e we have no act of the legi&s;lature to enforce the obligation?</P>
<P>Art. 16. &s;ecures the free exerci&s;e of our religious duties, according to the dictates of every man's own con&s;cience. Should the legi&s;lature, at any future period, e&s;tabli&s;h any particular mode of wor&s;hip, and enact penal laws to &s;upport it, will the courts of this commonwealth be bound to en|force tho&s;e penalties?</P>
<P>Art. 15. of the con&s;titution, declares that the clerks of courts &s;hall hold their offices during good behaviour, to be judged of and determined in the general court. Can any legi&s;lative act give any other court cognizance of &s;uch a ca&s;e?&mdash;Or can any impeachment be tried in any court of this commonwealth, except this court, and the court of ap|peals, even &s;hould an act of the legi&s;lature (as was once contemplated) erect a court for that e&s;pecial purpo&s;e?</P>
<P>From all the&s;e in&s;tances it appears to me that this deduc|tion clearly follows, viz. that the <HI>judiciary</HI> are <HI>bound</HI> to take notice of the con&s;titution, <HI>as the fir&s;t law of the land;</HI> and
<PB N="49" REF="027777_0047_0FD63E0F0B3969C0">
that what&s;oever is contradictory thereto, is <HI>not</HI> the law of the land.</P>
<P>And here I &s;hall avail my&s;elf of the rea&s;oning of one of the able&s;t political writers that has appeared in America.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pub. v. <HI>2.</HI> p. <HI>293.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Some perplexity re&s;pecting the right of the courts to pronounce legi&s;lative acts void, becau&s;e contrary to the con&s;titution, has ari&s;en, he ob&s;erves, from an imagination that the doctrine would imply a &s;uperiority of the judi|ciary over the legi&s;lative power. It is urged that the power which can declare the acts of another void, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;uperior to the one who&s;e acts may be de|clared void.</P>
<P>But there is no po&s;ition which depends on clearer prin|ciples, than that every act of a delegated authority, con|trary to the tenor of the commi&s;&s;ion under which it is ex|erci&s;ed, is void. No legi&s;lative act therefore, contrary to the con&s;titution, can be valid. To deny this would be to affirm, that the deputy is greater than the principal; that the &s;ervant is above his ma&s;ter; that the repre&s;enta|tives of the people are &s;uperior to the people them&s;elves.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid that the legi&s;lative body are them&s;elves the con&s;titutional judges of their own powers, and that the con&s;truction they put upon them is conclu&s;ive upon the other departments, it may be an&s;wered that this can|not be the natural pre&s;umption, where it is not to be col|lected from any particular provi&s;ions in the con&s;titution. It is not otherwi&s;e to be &s;uppo&s;ed that the con&s;titution could intend to enable the repre&s;entatives of the people to &s;ub&s;titute their will to that of their con&s;tituents. It is far more rational to &s;uppo&s;e that the courts were de|&s;igned to be an intermediate body between the people and the legi&s;lature, in order, among other things, to keep
<PB N="50" REF="027777_0048_0FD63E115C946800">
the latter within the limits a&s;&s;igned to their authority. The interpretation of the laws is the proper and particu|lar province of the courts. A con&s;titution is in fact, and mu&s;t be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to a&s;certain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legi&s;lative body. If there be an irreconcileable va|riance between the two, that which has the &s;uperior ob|ligation and validity ought of cour&s;e to be preferred; or, in other words, the con&s;titution ought to be preferred to the &s;tatutes; the intention of the people to the intention of their agents.</P>
<P>Nor does this conclu&s;ion by any means &s;uppo&s;e a &s;upe|riority of the judiciary to the legi&s;lative power. It only &s;uppo&s;es that the power of the people is &s;uperior to both; and that where the will of the legi&s;lature, declared in its &s;tatutes, &s;tands in appo&s;ition to that of the people, declar|ed in the con&s;titution, the judges ought to be governed by the latter, rather than the former. They ought to regulate their deci&s;ions by the fundamental laws, rather than tho&s;e which are not fundamental.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Publius <HI>295.</HI></NOTE>It can be of no weight to &s;ay that the courts, on the pretence of a repugnancy, may &s;ub&s;titute their own plea|&s;ure to the con&s;titutional intentions of the legi&s;lature. This might as well happen in the ca&s;e of two contradic|tory &s;tatutes; or it might as well happen in every adju|dication upon any &s;ingle &s;tatute. The courts mu&s;t de|clare the &s;en&s;e of the law. The ob&s;ervation, if it proved any thing, would prove that there ought to be no judges di&s;tinct from the legi&s;lative body.</P>

<P N="2">2. Whether, according to the con&s;titution of this com|monwealth, a judge of the general court can exerci&s;e the functions of a judge in chancery?</P>

<P>The independence of the judiciary re&s;ults from the te|nure of their office, which the con&s;titution declares &s;hall be <HI>during good behaviour.</HI> The offices which they are to fill mu&s;t therefore in their nature be permanent as the con&s;ti|tution it&s;elf, and not liable to be di&s;continued or annihilated by any other branch of the government. Hence the con|&s;titution has provided that the judiciary department &s;hould be arranged in &s;uch a manner as not to be &s;ubject to legi&s;|lative control. The court of appeals, court of chancery, and general court, are tribunals expre&s;sly required by it; and in the&s;e courts the judiciary power is either immediate|ly, or ultimately ve&s;ted.</P>
<P>The&s;e courts can neither be annihilated or di&s;continued by any legi&s;lative act; nor can the judges of them be re|moved from their offices for any cau&s;e, except a breach of their good behaviour.</P>
<P>But if the legi&s;lature might at any time di&s;continue or annihilate either of the&s;e courts, it is plain that their tenure
<PB N="52" REF="027777_0050_0FD63E12B46139B8">
of office might be changed, &s;ince a judge, without any breach of good behaviour, might in effect be removed from office, by annihilating or di&s;continuing the office it&s;elf.</P>
<P>This has been proved in the ca&s;e of the former court of appeals.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Virg. Acts <HI>vi. 1788,</HI> ch. <HI>68.</HI></NOTE> The moment that it was di&s;covered that that court was not con&s;tituted according to the directions of the con&s;titution, the legi&s;lature, without any charge of a breach of good behaviour by any one of that court, <HI>removed a ma|jority</HI> of the judges from their office, as judges of that court, <HI>by new-moddelling the court altogether.</HI></P>
<P>I am far from con&s;idering this act of the legi&s;lature as un|con&s;titutional, for rea&s;ons that I &s;hall hereafter mention.</P>
<P>But it proves that the judiciary can never be indepen|dent, &s;o long as the exi&s;tence of the office depends upon the will of the ordinary legi&s;lature, and not upon a con&s;titution|al foundation.</P>
<P>The di&s;trict courts con&s;idered as independent of the <HI>gene+ral court,</HI> and not a modification of it, are merely <HI>legi&s;lative</HI> courts, and con&s;equently may be di&s;continued, or annihi|lated, whenever the legi&s;lature may think proper to aboli&s;h them.&mdash;And if the judges of tho&s;e courts held their offices only as judges of the di&s;trict courts, they might be virtual|ly, and in fact, removed from office, as the judges of the former court of appeals were, by a legi&s;lative act, di&s;conti|nuing the courts, and transferring their juri&s;diction to other tribunals, <HI>without any breach of good behaviour.</HI></P>
<P>Hence ari&s;es a mo&s;t important di&s;tinction between <HI>con&s;ti|tutional</HI> and <HI>legi&s;lative</HI> courts. The judges of the former hold an office co-exi&s;tent with the government it&s;elf, and which they can only forfeit by a breach of good behaviour. The judges of the latter, although their commi&s;&s;ions &s;hould import upon the face of them, to be during good behaviour,
<PB N="53" REF="027777_0051_0FD63E14B5AC6310">
may be at any time di&s;continued from their office, by aboli&s;h|ing the courts.&mdash;In other words, con&s;titutional judges may be an independent branch of the government, legi&s;lative judges mu&s;t ever be dependant on that body at who&s;e will their offices exi&s;t.</P>
<P>If the principles of our government have e&s;tabli&s;hed the judiciary as a barrier again&s;t the po&s;&s;ible u&s;urpation, or abu&s;e of power in the other departments, how ea&s;ily may that principle be evaded by converting our courts into le|gi&s;lative, in&s;tead of Con&s;titutional tribunals?</P>
<P>To pre&s;erve this principle in it's full vigour, it is nece&s;|&s;ary that the con&s;titutional courts &s;hould all be re&s;trained within tho&s;e limits which the con&s;titution it&s;elf &s;eems to have a&s;&s;igned to them re&s;pectively.</P>
<P>What tho&s;e limits are, may be collected from the 14th article, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Con&s;t. Virg. ar. <HI>14.</HI></NOTE> which provides for the appointment of <Q>judges <HI>of the &s;upreme court of</HI> appeals, <HI>and</HI> general court, judges <HI>in</HI> chancery, judges <HI>of</HI> admiralty,</Q> &amp;c. This &s;pecifica|tion of judges of <HI>&s;everal tribunals,</HI> would lead us of it&s;elf to conclude, that the tribunals them&s;elves were meant to be &s;eparate and di&s;tinct <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Since every word in that in&s;trument, the con&s;titution of the com|monwealth, &s;hould be con&s;trued to have its effect; a rule applied to all written in&s;truments what&s;oever, and more peculiarly applicable, I &s;hould pre&s;ume, to that which expre&s;&s;es the collective, and &s;overeign will, and intention of the people.</NOTE>. This conclu&s;ion &s;eems to be warranted by two circum&s;tances, the one extrin&s;ic, the other ari&s;ing out of the con&s;titution it&s;elf. Tho&s;e who recollect the &s;ituation of our juri&s;prudence, at the time of the revo|lution, will remember that the union of civil and criminal, common law, and equity juri&s;diction, all in the general
<PB N="54" REF="027777_0052_0FD63E172D068510">
court, was one of the mo&s;t obvious defects of that &s;y&s;tem. In truth, nothing can be more dangerous to the citizen, than the union of criminal courts, and courts of equity. On the European continent, where&s;oever the civil law has been adopted, criminal and civil proceedings have been con|ducted upon the like principles: the defendant in <HI>civil</HI> ca&s;es might be examined upon oath by interrogatories, to which if he gave not &s;atisfactory an&s;wers he might be committed until he did&punc; this principle being extended to <HI>criminal</HI> ca&s;es, was denominated by the moderate term of putting the per|&s;on accu&s;ed to the <HI>que&s;tion:</HI> but ina&s;much as the forcing a criminal to accu&s;e him&s;elf on <HI>oath,</HI> might prove a <HI>&s;nare to his con&s;cience,</HI> the obligation to an&s;wer to the que&s;tion, <HI>was inforced by torture.</HI> To &s;eparate forever, courts, who&s;e principles and proceedings are &s;o diametrically oppo&s;ite, as tho&s;e of the common and civil law, was, I &s;hould pre&s;ume, one of the fundamental principles which the framers of our con&s;titution had an eye to. They, therefore, di&s;tributed the powers of the <HI>then exi&s;ting general court</HI> into three di&s;|tinct branches, viz. the court of appeals, the court of chan|cery, and the court of general juri&s;diction, at common law. The repetition of the term, judges, &s;hews that it was in contemplation that both the tribunals, and the judges &s;hould be di&s;tinct and &s;eparate. This is farther confirmed by art. 16 and 17:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Con&s;t. Virg. arts. <HI>16.</HI> and <HI>17.</HI></NOTE> the former of which provides that impeachments in general &s;hall be pro&s;ecuted in <HI>this</HI> court, the latter that impeachments again&s;t the judges of <HI>this court,</HI> &s;hall be pro|&s;ecuted in the <HI>court of appeals.</HI> Nothing, then, can be clearer than that the con&s;titution intended they &s;hould be di&s;tinct judges of di&s;tinct courts. And hence I am &s;atisfied, that the former court of appeals was uncon&s;titutionally or|ganized.
<PB N="55" REF="027777_0053_0FD63E1DA44AF078">
This rea&s;oning, I apprehend will apply no le&s;s forcibly to the &s;eparation of the general court from the court of chancery. A judge of the general court, if im|peached, can be pro&s;ecuted in the <HI>court</HI> of <HI>appeals only;</HI> a judge in chancery <HI>only</HI> in the <HI>general court:</HI> if the&s;e offices be united in the &s;ame per&s;on, it mu&s;t be by &s;eparate commi&s;|&s;ions; a judgment on impeachment in the general court, cannot vacate the commi&s;&s;ion of a judge of that court, be|cau&s;e the con&s;titution has a&s;&s;igned another tribunal, where a judge of that court &s;hall be tried; a judgment in the court of appeals cannot vacate the commi&s;&s;ion of a judge in chancery, becau&s;e he mu&s;t be tried, <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> in the general court. Hence it &s;eems to me we are driven to conclude that the con&s;titution meant that the two offices &s;hall be &s;epa|rate and di&s;tinct. This con&s;truction removes every difficul|ty, the contrary, I apprehend, creates a multitude, and tho&s;e in&s;urmountable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A curious que&s;tion might here be propounded. Suppo&s;e a judge of the general court, holding al&s;o a commi&s;&s;ion as a judge in chancery, and &s;itting as a judge of a di&s;trict court, where his functions were unit|ed, &s;hould receive a bribe from one of the parties to a &s;uit depending there before him: that on the trial at law he &s;hall endeavour to influ|ence the jury, and &s;hall after grant an injunction to the party from who he received the bribe: Mu&s;t there be two impeachments and two trials, in different courts in this ca&s;e, or could one trial, and one judgment vacate both commi&s;&s;ions?</NOTE>. In pur&s;uance of this direction, contained in the con&s;titution, the legi&s;lature, when it &s;et about organizing the courts, di&s;tributed them as above-men|tioned. The criminal and common law court, was &s;epa|rated from the court of equity; and both from the court of appeals, in form, though not in reality, until the legi&s;lature, by the act of 1788, c. 68. corrected it's former error. And
<PB N="56" REF="027777_0054_0FD63E1EB86082A8">
thus di&s;tinct have they remained, until the act of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, which hath not indeed united the con&s;titutional courts, but hath blended them in effect, by a&s;&s;igning the functions of a judge in chancery to the judges of this court; and if carried into effect may lead to the total annihilation of all the courts which the con&s;titution had in contemplation to e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid before (pa. 52,) that the di&s;trict courts con&s;i|dered as independent of the general court, and not a mo|dification of it, are mere legi&s;lative, and not con&s;titutional courts. If they are a modification only of the general court, it flows from what I have already &s;aid, that the con|&s;titution prohibits the exerci&s;e of chancery juri&s;diction there|in. If they be mere legi&s;lative courts, it cannot be the duty of any judge of a con&s;titutional court, <HI>merely as &s;uch,</HI> to exerci&s;e the functions of a judge of the&s;e courts: and it is, I conceive, expre&s;sly contrary to the duty of a con&s;titu|tional judge of one court, to exerci&s;e the functions of a con&s;titutional judge of another di&s;tinct con&s;titutional court.</P>
<P>It appears then immaterial, whether, on the pre&s;ent que&s;tion, the di&s;trict courts are to be con&s;idered as branches of the general court, or not: yet it would be ea&s;y to &s;hew, that as they are at pre&s;ent modified and organized, they are nothing more than branches of that court; and not di&s;|tinct, independent, legi&s;lative courts; unle&s;s the operation of the act in que&s;tion &s;hould be con&s;trued to affect and change their whole &s;y&s;tem, and con&s;titution.</P>
<P>But, if they are mere legi&s;lative courts, they may, at any time, be organized at the will of the legi&s;lature: le|gi&s;lative judges may be appointed, the tenor of who&s;e com|mi&s;&s;ion may import that their office &s;hall be during good be|haviour, and yet that office be di&s;continued whenever the legi&s;lature may think fit. If the juri&s;diction of the court of chancery can be con&s;titutionally transferred to them, &s;o
<PB N="57" REF="027777_0055_0FD63E202F6E8078">
may that of the general court, and of the court of appeals. In fine the&s;e legi&s;lative courts may ab&s;orb all the juri&s;dic|tions, powers and functions of the con&s;titutional courts. The&s;e la&s;t then mu&s;t either be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, as u&s;ele&s;s, which the con&s;titution forbids<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Art. <HI>14.</HI></NOTE>; or the judges of them will hold <HI>&s;inecures</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>offices,</HI> which is expre&s;sly contrary to the bill of rights, art. 4. Add to this that &s;uch an arrange|ment mu&s;t ever render the judiciary the mere creature of the legi&s;lative department, which both the con&s;titution<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Con&s;t. V. art. <HI>3.</HI></NOTE>, and the bill of rights <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bill of Rights, art. <HI>5.</HI></NOTE> mo&s;t pointedly appear to have guarded again&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. I &s;hall now proceed to take a &s;hort view of the &s;ub|ject, as founded upon a &s;olemn deci&s;ion of the court of ap|peals, on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>It will not, I pre&s;ume, be denied that the deci&s;ions of the &s;upreme court of appeals in this commonwealth, upon any que&s;tion, whether ari&s;ing upon the general principles of law, the operation or con&s;truction of any &s;tatute or act of a&s;&s;embly, or of the con&s;titution of this commonwealth, are to be re&s;orted to by all other courts, as expounding, in their true&s;t &s;en&s;e, the laws of the land; and where any deci&s;ion of that court applies to a ca&s;e depending before any other tribunal, that tribunal is bound to regulate its deci|&s;ions conformably to tho&s;e of the court of appeals. This po&s;tulatum I conceive to be too obviou&s;ly founded upon the principles of our government to require an attempt to de|mon&s;trate it. Proceeding upon this ground, I &s;hall take up
<PB N="58" REF="027777_0056_0FD63E221A6483F8">
the que&s;tion upon the authority of a previous deci&s;ion of that court, on a &s;imilar que&s;tion.</P>
<P>In the year 1787, the fir&s;t act e&s;tabli&s;hing di&s;trict courts was pa&s;&s;ed. This act <Q>declared it to be the duty of the judges of the high court of appeals to attend the &s;aid courts, allotting among them&s;elves the di&s;tricts they &s;hould re&s;pectively attend; three judges to be allotted to each di&s;trict; any two of whom &s;hould con&s;titute a court.</Q> ch. 39. &sect; 3.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be remembered, that at that time the court of appeals was compo&s;ed of the judges of the high court of chancery; judges of the general court; and judges of the court of admiralty. The office of the judge of the court of appeals was, at that time, as it were, incidentally annexed to their appointment to a &s;eat on either of the other tribu|nals.</P>
<P>A part of the duty a&s;&s;igned to the court of appeals by that act was the appointment of clerks to the di&s;trict courts, which the act required &s;hould be done at the next &s;ucceed|ing &s;e&s;&s;ion of the court of appeals. Ib. &sect; 2.</P>
<P>On the 12th of May following, the court made the fol|lowing entry upon their records. <Q>On con&s;ideration of a late act of a&s;&s;embly, entitled an act e&s;tabli&s;hing di&s;trict courts, after &s;everal conferences, and upon mature deli|beration, the court do <HI>adjudge</HI> that clerks of the &s;aid courts ought not now to be appointed, for rea&s;ons con|tained in a remon&s;trance to the general a&s;&s;embly:</Q>&mdash; which remon&s;trance is likewi&s;e entered on record, and con|tains, among other things, the following important pa&s;|&s;ages.</P>
<P N="1">1. That in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the act e&s;tabli&s;hing di&s;trict courts, the court found it unavoidable to con&s;ider, whether the principles of that act do not violate tho&s;e of the con&s;titu|tion,
<PB N="59" REF="027777_0057_0FD63E23A88536F8">
or form of government, which the people, in 1776, when the former bands of their &s;ociety were di&s;&s;olved, e&s;tabli&s;hed as the foundation of that government which they judged nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of their per|&s;ons and property; and if &s;uch violation were apparent, whether they had power, and it was their duty to de|clare that the act mu&s;t yield to the con&s;titution?</P>
<P N="2">2. That they found them&s;elves obliged to decide, what|ever temporary inconveniencies might ari&s;e, and in that deci&s;ion to declare, that the con&s;titution and the act were in oppo&s;ition, and could not exi&s;t together, and that the former mu&s;t control the latter.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the propriety and nece&s;&s;ity of the indepen|dence of the judges is evident in rea&s;on, and the nature of their office, &s;ince they are to decide between govern|ment and the people, as well as between contending citi|zens; and if they be dependent on either, corrupt influ|ence may be apprehended.</P>
<P N="4">4. That this applies more forcibly to exclude a depen|dence on the legi&s;lature, a branch of whom, in ca&s;es of impeachment, is it&s;elf a party.</P>
<P N="5">5. To obviate a po&s;&s;ible objection that the court, while they are maintaining the independence of the judiciary, are countenancing encroachments of that branch upon the departments of others, and a&s;&s;uming a right to control the legi&s;lature, it may be ob&s;erved, that when they de|cide between an act of the people, and an act of the legi&s;|lature, they are within the line of their duty, declaring what the law is, and not making a new law.</P>
<P N="6">6. That although the duties of their office wer not a&s;|certained at the time of e&s;tabli&s;hing the con&s;titution, yet in re&s;pect thereto, the con&s;titution gives a principle, name|ly, that "no future regulation &s;hould blend the duties of the judges of the general court, court of chancery,
<PB N="60" REF="027777_0058_0FD63E25CDFD6FA8">
and court of admiralty, which the con&s;titution &s;eems to require to be exerci&s;ed by di&s;tinct per&s;ons."</P>
<P N="7">7. That the a&s;&s;igning to the judges of chancery and ad|miralty juri&s;diction in common law ca&s;es, may be con&s;i|dered as a new office."</P>
<P>The&s;e declarations, according to my weak apprehen&s;ions, comprehend the pre&s;ent que&s;tion in the fulle&s;t extent. I &s;hould therefore be of opinion, upon the ground of this au|thority, as well as upon the conviction of my own mind, in|dependent thereof, which, unle&s;s &s;o fortified, I might have mi&s;tru&s;ted, that we ought to certify to the di&s;trict court of Dumfries <Q>That in the opinion of this court, a judge of the general court cannot con&s;titutionally exerci&s;e the func|tions of a judge in chancery.</Q> But the judges who have already delivered their opinions, although &s;ome of them ap+pear to di&s;&s;ent from me upon this point, having unanimou&s;ly concurred in another, viz. That the functions of a judge in chancery can only be exerci&s;ed by tho&s;e who may be con&s;ti|tuted judges in chancery, in the manner pre&s;cribed by the con&s;titution; I &s;hall concur in their unanimous judgment, without offering any rea&s;ons on a &s;ubject which has been &s;o fully and &s;atisfactorily di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by them.</P>
<P>When the court unanimou&s;ly agreed, and the certificate was in the&s;e words:</P>
<P>"Ordered, that it be certified to the &s;aid di&s;trict court (Dumfries,) as the opinion of this court, <Q>that the motion of the plaintiff, praying an injunction, to &s;tay the pro|ceedings on a judgment obtained again&s;t him in the &s;aid di&s;trict court by the defendant, ought to be over ruled, becau&s;e the powers and duties a&s;&s;igned to be performed by the eleventh &s;ection of the act of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of a&s;&s;em|bly, entitled 'an act reducing into one the &s;everal acts concerning the e&s;tabli&s;hment, juri&s;diction, and powers of the di&s;trict courts,' can only be executed by tho&s;e who may be con&s;tituted judges in chancery, in the manner pre|&s;cribed by the con&s;titution of this common wealth,</Q></P>

<HEAD>THE CONSTITUTION. The Con&s;titution, or Form of Government, agreed to and re&s;olved upon by the Delegates and Repre&s;entatives of the &s;everal Counties and Corporations of Virginia.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WHEREAS George the third, king of Great Britain and Ireland, and elector of Hanover, heretofore entru&s;ted with the exerci&s;e of the kingly office in this government, hath endeavoured to pervert the &s;ame into a dete&s;table and in&s;upportable ty|ranny, by putting his negative on laws the mo&s;t whole&s;ome and nece&s;&s;ary for the public good: By denying his gover|nors permi&s;&s;ion to pa&s;s laws of immediate and pre&s;&s;ing im|portance, unle&s;s &s;u&s;pended in their operation for his a&s;&s;ent, and when &s;o &s;u&s;pended, neglecting to attend to them for many years: By refu&s;ing to pa&s;s certain other laws, unle&s;s the per&s;ons to be benefited by them would relinqui&s;h the in|e&s;timable right of repre&s;entation in the legi&s;lature: By di&s;|&s;olving legi&s;lative a&s;&s;emblies repeatedly and continually, for oppo&s;ing, with manly firmne&s;s, his inva&s;ions of the rights of the people: When di&s;&s;olved, by refu&s;ing to call others for a long &s;pace of time, thereby leaving the political &s;y&s;|tem without any legi&s;lative head: By endeavouring to pre|vent the population of our country, and, for that purpo&s;e, ob&s;tructing the laws for the naturalization of foreigners: By keeping among us, in the time of peace, &s;tanding armies and &s;hips of war: By affecting to render the military inde|pendent of, and &s;uperior to the civil power: By combining
<PB N="66" REF="027777_0064_0FD63E31076A4120">
with others to &s;ubject us to foreign juri&s;diction, giving his a&s;&s;ent to their pretended acts of legi&s;lation: For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us: For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world: For impo&s;ing taxes on us without our con&s;ent: For depriving us of the benefits of trial by jury: For tran&s;porting us beyond &s;eas, to be tried for pretended offences: For &s;u&s;pending our own legi&s;la|tures, and declaring them&s;elves inve&s;ted with power to le|gi&s;late for us in all ca&s;es what&s;oever: By plundering our &s;eas, ravaging our coa&s;ts, burning our towns, and de&s;troy|ing the lives of our people: By inciting in&s;urrections of our fellow &s;ubjects, with the allurements of forfeiture and con|fi&s;cation: By prompting our negroes to ri&s;e in arms among us, tho&s;e very negroes whom, by an inhuman u&s;e of his ne|gative, he hath refu&s;ed us permi&s;&s;ion to exclude by law: By endeavouring to bring on the inhabitants of our fron|tiers, the mercile&s;s Indian &s;avages, who&s;e known rule of warfare is an undi&s;tingui&s;hed de&s;truction of all ages, &s;exes, and conditions of exi&s;tence: By tran&s;porting, at this time, a large army of foreign mercenaries, to complete the works of death, de&s;olation, and tyranny, already begun with cir|cum&s;tances of cruelty and perfidy, unworthy the head of a civilized nation: By an&s;wering our repeated petitions for redre&s;s with a repetition of injuries: And finally, by aban|doning the helm of government, and declaring us out of his allegiance and protection. By which &s;everal acts of mi&s;rule the government of this country, as formerly exer|ci&s;ed under the crown of Great Britain, is totally di&s;&s;olved.</P>

for the trial of criminals who might remain in the public jail after the &s;e&s;&s;ion of the general court in June next, or who might be examined and committed prior to the &s;aid fir&s;t day of July; and whether for want of preci&s;ion in &s;e|veral other parts of the law, it was, in the re&s;pective ca&s;es to operate from the time of pa&s;&s;ing, or from the fir&s;t day of July.</P>
<P>(In other in&s;tances, particularly in the con&s;truction of the late execution law, regularly brought before the court this term, they have to lament the la&s;t difficulty, which they found &s;o great that nothing but the repo&s;e of the communi|ty, and the nece&s;&s;ity of having one uniform &s;y&s;tem in that re&s;pect could have induced the court to decide upon it at la&s;t without further con&s;ideration.)</P>
<P>But in the progre&s;s of their di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, they found it unavoidable to con&s;ider more important que&s;tions, viz: whether the principles of this act do not violate tho&s;e of the con&s;titution or form of government, which the people in 1776, when the former bands of their &s;ociety were di&s;|&s;olved, e&s;tabli&s;hed as the foundation of that government which they judged nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of their per&s;ons and property; and if &s;uch violation were apparent, whether they had power, and it was their duty, to declare that act mu&s;t yield to the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>And here they have again to lament, that there &s;hould be occa&s;ion to decide tho&s;e important que&s;tions in any ca&s;e, e&s;pecially at a time when the minds of the citizens are agi|tated upon other que&s;tions of great and national concern, more &s;o that the nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould occur in a ca&s;e wherein their individual intere&s;ts are involved, and &s;till more that a deci&s;ion one way might &s;u&s;pend, though for a &s;hort time, the beneficial effects of a law tending to promote the &s;peedy and ea&s;y admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="027777_0076_0FD63E4CD5095C58">On this view of the &s;ubject, the following alternative pre&s;ented them&s;elves to the court; either to decide tho&s;e que&s;tions, or re&s;ign their offices. The latter would have been their choice, if they could have con&s;idered the que&s;ti|ons as affecting their individual intere&s;ts only; but viewing them as relating to their office, and finding them&s;elves cal|led by their country to &s;u&s;tain an important po&s;t as one of the three pillars on which the great fabric of government was erected, they judged that a re&s;ignation would &s;ubject them to the reproach of de&s;erting their &s;tation, and betray|ing the &s;acred intere&s;ts of &s;ociety entru&s;ted with them, and on that ground found them&s;elves obliged to decide, how|ever their delicacy might be wounded, or whatever tempo|rary inconveniencies might en&s;ue, and in that deci&s;ion to declare that the con&s;titution and the act are in oppo&s;ition and cannot exi&s;t together, and that the former mu&s;t control the operation of the latter. If this opinion declaring the &s;upremacy of the con&s;titution needed any &s;upport, it may be found in the opinion of the legi&s;lature them&s;elves, who have in &s;everal in&s;tances con&s;idered the con&s;titution as pre&s;crib|ing limits to their powers as well as to tho&s;e of the other departments of government.</P>
<P>In forming their judgment upon both que&s;tions they had recour&s;e to that article in the declaration of rights, that no free government, or the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty can be pre&s;erv|ed to any people but (among other things) by frequent recurrence to fundamental principles; an article worthy to be written in letters of gold. The propriety and nece&s;&s;ity of the independence of the judges is evident in rea&s;on, and the nature of their office, &s;ince they are to decide between government and the people as well as between contending citizens, and if they be dependent on either, corrupt influ|ence may be apprehended, &s;acrificing the innocent to popu|lar prejudice; and &s;ubjecting the poor to oppre&s;&s;ion and per|&s;ecution
<PB N="79" REF="027777_0077_0FD63E51D3D69148">
by the rich, and this applies more forcibly to exclude a dependence on the legi&s;lature, a branch of whom in ca&s;es of impeachment, is it&s;elf a party. This principle &s;uppo&s;ed, the court are led to con&s;ider, whether the people have &s;ecured, or departed from it, in their con|&s;titution or form of government. In that &s;olemn act they di&s;cover the people di&s;tributing the governmental powers, into three great branches, legi&s;lature, executive, and judici|ary, in order to pre&s;erve that equipoi&s;e which they judged nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure their liberty, declaring that tho&s;e powers be kept &s;eparate and di&s;tinct from each other, and that no per&s;on &s;hall exerci&s;e at the &s;ame time an office in more than one of them. The independence of the two former could not be admitted, becau&s;e in them a long continuance in office might be dangerous to liberty, and therefore they provided for a change, by frequent elections at &s;tated periods; but in the la&s;t from the influence of the principle before ob&s;erved upon, they declared that the judges &s;hould hold their offices during good behaviour. Their independence would have been rendered compleat, by fixing the quantum of their &s;a|laries, which perhaps would have been done, if the duties of office had been at that time a&s;certained. But although it was not then done, yet in re&s;pect to this, the con&s;titution gives a principle, not to be departed from, declaring that the &s;alaries &s;hall be adequate and fixed, leaving it to the legi&s;lature to judge what would be adequate when they &s;hould appoint the duties. And when they had &s;o done, they exerci&s;ed their whole power over the &s;ubject, and the &s;alary was thenceforth to be con&s;idered as fixed, while the duties &s;hould continue the &s;ame. And when public utility &s;hould require an increa&s;e or diminution of duty, there &s;hould be an analogous alteration of &s;alary, with this re&s;tric|tion however, that &s;uch regulation &s;hould not blend the duties of the judges of the general court, court of chancery,
<PB N="80" REF="027777_0078_0FD63E549AE7B9D0">
and court of admiralty, which the con&s;titution &s;eems to re|quire to be exerci&s;ed by di&s;tinct per&s;ons; and the legi&s;lature appear to have &s;o con&s;idered it in the arrangement of tho&s;e courts.</P>
<P>The court of appeals of whom&s;oever con&s;tituted, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily act upon the &s;ubjects referred to all the others, and therefore the forming it &s;o as to con&s;i&s;t of all the judges is no violation of the con&s;titution; and that mode, a&s;&s;imu|lated to adjournments of ca&s;es before all the judges of Eng|land in the exchequer chamber, may have been dictated by nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>The court then proceeded to con&s;ider what had been done by the legi&s;lature in con&s;equence of the con&s;titution. In the October &s;e&s;&s;ion of 1777, they pa&s;&s;ed two acts, orga|nizing the general court and court of chancery, giving to the former juri&s;diction at common law, in civil ca&s;es as well as criminal, and to the latter juri&s;diction in all ca&s;es in equi|ty. The duties of each were di&s;tinctly pointed out, and a &s;alary of five hundred pounds to each judge was thought by the legi&s;lature to be an adequate reward for tho&s;e du|ties, and this previous to the appointment of any judges. The election of the judges followed, when four of tho&s;e at pre&s;ent in office were of the number elected; who, thinking as they &s;till think the &s;alary was adequate to the &s;ervices, declined other pur&s;uits, and accepted their appointments, under a confidence that the con&s;titution <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> them to that &s;alary, &s;o long as they &s;hould perform the duty, in an upright manner.</P>
<P>The nominal &s;um they conceived was to be paid them in &s;pecie, or in &s;omething equivalent thereto, and they have rea&s;on to believe the legi&s;lature &s;o under&s;tood it, from laws in force at that period, making it penal to demand an allow|ance for the difference between &s;pecie and paper money.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="027777_0079_0FD63E5731930A40">And though the other judges have been called into duty by &s;ub&s;equent appointments, they may be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;tand upon the &s;ame ground of original compact. The court of admiralty, indeed, was not permanently con&s;tituted 'till the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;eventy-nine, and the judges then appointed; yet by being made judges of the court of appeals, they have ever &s;ince been put upon the &s;ame footing with their brethren in point of &s;alary. The various &s;ub&s;titutions of paper money and tobacco for &s;pecie, which was not to be had, the judges con&s;idered as temporary expedients, which, though operating greatly to the dimi|nution of their &s;alaries, were not de&s;igned to affect their independence; and therefore they acquie&s;ced, content to &s;hare in the public calamities, in hopes of a recurrence to the con&s;titutional principle in better times. And they con|&s;idered in the &s;ame light the act of one thou&s;and &s;even hun|dred and eighty-one, &s;tating the &s;alary at three hundred pounds, as dictated by nece&s;&s;ity, and not proceeding from de&s;ign, and therefore, did not conceive it to be their official duty to interpo&s;e.</P>
<P>But the act now under con&s;ideration, pre&s;enting a &s;y&s;tem, which a&s;&s;igns to the judges of the chancery and admiralty juri&s;diction in common law ca&s;es, which &s;o far may be con&s;i|dered as a new office, the labour of which would greatly ex|ceed that of the former, without a corre&s;pondent reward, and to the judges of the general court duties, which though not changed as to their &s;ubjects are yet more than doubled, without any increa&s;e of &s;alary, appeared &s;o evident an at|tack upon the independency of the judges that they thought it incon&s;i&s;tent with a con&s;cientious di&s;charge of their duty to pa&s;s it over. For vain would be the precaution of the founders of our government to &s;ecure liberty, if the legi&s;la|ture though re&s;trained from changing the tenure of judici|al offices, are at liberty to compel a re&s;ignation by reducing
<PB N="82" REF="027777_0080_0FD63E58A06A8DB0">
&s;alaries to a copper, or by making it a part of the official duty to become hewers of wood and drawers of water, or if in ca&s;e of a contrary di&s;po&s;ition, they can make &s;alaries exhorbitant, or by le&s;&s;ening the duties render offices almo&s;t &s;inecures; the independency of the judiciary is in either ca&s;e, equally annihilated. The court, however, willing to hope, that in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance the legi&s;lature had no &s;uch de|&s;ign, but that inattention or &s;ome other circum&s;tances might occa&s;ion the deviation, and that upon a revi&s;ion of the &s;ubject, this law will be placed upon unexceptionable ground, had only to con&s;ider what ought to be their con|duct in the mean time. The re&s;ult of which was that they ought not to do any thing officially in execution of an act which appeared to be contrary to the &s;pirit of the con&s;titu|tion, and therefore they declined to appoint the clerks of the di&s;trict courts, under the &s;aid act.</P>
<P>To obviate a po&s;&s;ible objection, that the court, while they are maintaining the independency of the judiciary, are countenancing encroachments of that branch upon the de|partments of others, and a&s;&s;uming a right to control the legi&s;lature, it may be ob&s;erved that when they decide be|tween an act of the people and an act of the legi&s;lature, they are within the line of their duty, declaring what the law is, and not making a new law. And ever di&s;po&s;ed to maintain harmony with the other members of govern|ment, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to promote the happine<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> of &s;ociety, the court mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;h, that the pre&s;ent infraction of the con&s;titution may be remedied by the legi&s;lature them&s;elves, and thereby all further unea&s;ine&s;s on the occa&s;ion be pre|vented. But &s;hould their wi&s;hes be di&s;appointed by the event, they &s;ee no other alternative for a deci&s;ion between the legi&s;lature and judiciary than an appeal to the people, who&s;e &s;ervants both are, and for who&s;e &s;akes both were created, and who may exerci&s;e their original and &s;upreme
