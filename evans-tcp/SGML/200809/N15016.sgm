<HEAD>MEMORIAL, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IT was reported to me, that every method was practi&s;ed by lawle&s;s people on &s;hore, to &s;acrifice me and the &s;ervice to their di&s;appointment and vengeance.</P>
<P>That one of the Alliance's bargemen was put in pri&s;on by Mr. Dale and Mr. Williams, for &s;aying, that &s;aid barge (being at L'Orient) was Captain Landai's barge.</P>
<P>That one of the &s;erjeants of the marines received five French guineas, and &s;everal marines &s;ixty l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">res, and &s;ome other &s;eamen more or le&s;s, by the direction of Captain Jones, for acknowledging him to be their Captain; and they &s;aid they had promi&s;es to be paid all their prize-money (and were directed to tell the &s;ame to every man on board) if they would return to their duty, mean|ing, I &s;uppo&s;e, if they would deliver the frigate to him.</P>
<P>Some of the Bon-homme Richard's people formerly, who made part of the Alliance's crew then, having received intelligence of Captain Jones's promi&s;es made by his agent, were heard to &s;ay they would cut the cables in order to have the frigate drove on &s;hore.</P>
<P>A whole crew of one of the Alliance's boats being &s;ent on duty to L'Orient, were taken, and put by force on board the Ariel.</P>
<P>Mr. Moylan &s;topped and prevented the Alliance's &s;tores and provi&s;ions from coming on board.</P>
<P>Mr. Blodger, the Alliance's purter, was confined by Captain Jones for &s;ome days, on board the Ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hip.&mdash;By all which proceedings the Alliance's crew would &s;oon have been bribed and deterred from their duty; and being reduced in numbers, become incompetent to the &s;hip's &s;ervice, and in&s;ufficient and incapable to defend her again&s;t the enemies.</P>
<P>By the&s;e dangers attending the &s;ending the boats on &s;hore to L'Orient, I was compelled to have part of the fre&s;h water brought on board with great difficulty from Groay i&s;land.</P>
<P>The Bon-homme Richard's people on board, di&s;covered &s;o much di&s;&s;atisfaction, and evinced a &s;pirit of mutiny to &s;uch a degree, that, tho' I was not fully manned, I &s;ent &s;eventeen of them to Captain Jones.</P>
<P>The &s;tores and provi&s;ion came at la&s;t on the 30th June on board, and were taken in during the night time. Lieutenant Elwood, of the marines, had two hog&s;heads of wine brought on board; I was &s;o preci&s;e to the orders I had received from the Navy-Board at Bo&s;ton, to let no private goods be brought in the &s;hip, that I ordered they &s;hould not be &s;towed in the fi&s;h-room or hold, that they might not be carried to America.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the abovementioned dangers, of being deprived of the crew by their being forcibly put on board the Ariel&mdash;of being reduced to want of provi&s;ions on board, by the oppo&s;ition made on &s;hore to their coming off&mdash;having already the crew almo&s;t bribed, by the promi&s;es made on &s;hore to them by Captain Jones's agents, to do any thing again&s;t my command&mdash;the &s;aid frigate was ex|po&s;ed
<PB N="4" REF="019056_0003_0FAA0D83A3C038C0">
to the &s;torms in an open road, and moreover to the &s;urpri&s;e or &s;uperior force of the enemies; which concurrence of plots and dangers made her &s;ailing nece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;But tho' I had been already better than two weeks waiting for his Excellency Dr. Franklin's order, and for his an&s;wer to the people about their prize-money, I wanted yet to &s;tay a little longer on the&s;e accounts.</P>
<P>Mr. De Gourlade &s;ent on board three &s;mall boxes, not weighing together above fifty pounds, for the Chevalier De la Luzerne, the French Mini&s;ter Plenipotentiary at Philadelphia; I thought that Congre&s;s would approve my receiving them, in con&s;equence I ordered the Ma&s;ter to receive and charge them in his book, and give a receipt for them, being the only private goods on board to my knowledge.</P>
<P>Two days before our &s;ailing, Capt. Bell's brother and Capt. P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rk came upon deck, and the former told me that he had a letter from Mr Moylan for me; I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wered, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> no bu&s;ine&s;s whatever with Mr. Moylan, and he might do what he plea&s;ed with &s;aid letter, as I would not receive it.</P>
<P>Having waited in vain till the 8th July for his Excellency B. Franklin's orders, and the expected payment of the crew's prize-money, and perceiving plainly that he would give neither&mdash; &s;eeing al&s;o the dangers the frigate had been and was &s;till expo&s;ed to in that road&mdash;the &s;olid rea&s;ons of the Honorable A. Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> contained in his letter to me of the 25th June ult. for &s;ailing &mdash;the Congre&s;s's order for the Alliance's return to Philadelphia&mdash;and the real blame I &s;hould incur in &s;taying longer without the po&s;itive order of his Excellency B. Franklin, determined me to &s;ail immediately.</P>
<P>Accordingly, at one o'clock, P. M. having in company the &s;hip Lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, Capt. Bell; a brig, Mr. Montgomery; a cha&s;&s;e maree, Mr. Smith; and a &s;chooner, Mr. Kerdie, which had a&s;ked me to &s;ail along with the Alliance. I had the &s;ignal to get under way made, and we did the &s;ame in the Alliance; the &s;hip's company being all in high &s;pirit, con&s;i&s;ted of two hundred and fifty men, be&s;ides pa&s;&s;engers. The &s;hip had been loaded too much by the &s;tern; &s;he being very foul, I had her bottom well hogg'd fore and aft the day before, and the barrels of gunpowder which had been imprudently &s;towed, were put in another place, out of danger in ca&s;e of an engagement, by the gunner.</P>
<P>M. De la Grandville, acting Intendant of the Navy at L'Orient, had given me intelligence when there, that an Engli&s;h fleet of five and twenty line of battle &s;hips had been &s;een off O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;&s;ant, about the 12th ult. but &s;ince had not appeared&mdash;having al&s;o read in the papers, that the enemies had &s;ent two two-deckers and &s;ome frigates, to cruize about the we&s;tern i&s;lands;&mdash;judging the naval Engli&s;h fleet was gone off Fini&s;terre, in order to prevent the junction of the French and Spani&s;h fleet together; to avoid meeting which, and tho&s;e about the We&s;tern I&s;lands, I thought it was be&s;t to keep in high latitude, where there was little danger, but to meet with a &s;ingle &s;hip at a time, which we might take or engage with, to defend the ve&s;&s;els in company: Be&s;ides which, we &s;hould thereby avoid the calm and extreme heat, con&s;equently the greate&s;t dangers of the enemies, &s;ickne&s;s among the &s;hip's company, and have a &s;horter pa&s;&s;age to the banks of Newfoundland, where I intended to have the &s;hip's bottom hogg'd again, before we made directly for Philadelphia.</P>
<P>Few days after we got under &s;ail, being at dinner, the Honorable A. Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> &s;aid he had ne|ver been to Bo&s;ton, nor had he ever &s;een the Ea&s;tern States, which induced him to wi&s;h that I would go thither; two of the Marquis de la Fayette's Aids de Camp and his Secretary joined with him, &s;aying, it would &s;pare them much fatigue and great expences to which they mu&s;t be expo&s;ed to go from Philadelphia to Rhode-I&s;land, at which place the Marquis was then known to be. Others &s;upported them, magnifying the dangers of going to Philadelphia. To all which I could an&s;wer nothing, but that the order of Congre&s;s was to carry the frigate there, whither then
<PB N="5" REF="019056_0004_0FAA0D842D247520">
we mu&s;t go:&mdash;Neverthele&s;s, tho' I had &s;hewn to the Honorable Arthur Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and his ne|phew, Ludwell Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> the&s;e orders at L'Orient, before I re&s;umed my command, as may appear by what he mentioned in a letter to me, dated there June 15th, and in which he mentioned al&s;o, that an officer is guilty whenever he does not obey his &s;uperiors order, they and others try'd to per&s;uade me to the contrary; and finding they could not, they grew peevi&s;h on all occa&s;ions:&mdash; And I &s;uppo&s;e, from &s;ub&s;equent tran&s;actions, which will be &s;een in the &s;equel, that the Honorable Arthur Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> had already devi&s;ed the plan to have the frigate carried to Bo&s;ton, with or again&s;t my con&s;ent.</P>
<P>On the 11th July, the cha&s;&s;e maree &s;prung and carried away &s;ome of her &s;pars, Mr. Smith determining thereon to go back to France, the Honorable A. Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> de&s;ired me to take on board his nephew, Mr. Lewis Lee, and &s;ome other pa&s;&s;engers who had embarked in this ve&s;&s;el, which I did in&s;tantly, by &s;ending a boat to bring them on board, having nothing more at heart, next to the &s;ervice, than to oblige him in all I could.</P>
<P>The Honorable A. Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> for whom I had all the deference and complai&s;ance due to his rank and former character as Mini&s;ter, having let him chu&s;e the be&s;t &s;tate-room in the cabbin, and all other accommodations that could be procured on board; notwith&s;tanding, began to wrangle with me on all accounts, particularly every day at table, complaining and applying, with bitterne&s;s and haughtine&s;s, to me as the author that the water &s;tank&mdash;the meat and other things were either too much or not done enough, &amp;c. &amp;c. I repre&s;ented to him, that the rea&s;on why the water was not good, was that the ca&s;ks had not been properly clean&s;ed before they were filled, and it was taken in a place that was not clean, as they wa&s;hed their linen, &amp;c. but I could not help it, as it was put on board before I re&s;umed the command.&mdash;However, tho' the &s;hip was already very crank, with a de&s;ign to plea&s;e him if po&s;&s;ible, I ordered a water-tub holding two hog&s;heads to be filled and fixed clo&s;e to the main-ma&s;t on the quarter-deck, and there filled every morning, to air the water, and take off as much as po&s;&s;ible its bad &s;mell; at the &s;ame time ordered a centry to &s;tand by to make every body ob&s;erve cleanne&s;s in taking the water out of &s;aid tub for any pur|po&s;e: the petty officers were al&s;o to take a quart of water thence every day for tea.&mdash;I &s;ent at almo&s;t every meal for the cook, and recommended him to have the meat more or le&s;s done, accor|ding to the ta&s;te of the Honorable A. Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> but all I did to keep in peace, tho' far beyond my duty, was in vain, as he had probably a plan in his head which he wanted to begin by wrangling. He had to &s;econd him in the fir&s;t place his two nephews, Me&s;&s;irs. Lewis Lee and Ludwell Lee, and Mr. Living&s;ton, Lieutenant of a man of war, (who was then pa&s;&s;enger, and had helped him with his te&s;timony again&s;t Silas Deane, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>) all three devoted to his will, and fit per&s;ons to work on the mind of the other pa&s;&s;engers and officers, and promote the execution of his projects.</P>
<P>The &s;hip having been from the beginning too much loaded by the &s;tern, be&s;ides the ward-room filled &s;ince with officers and pa&s;&s;engers trunks, I repre&s;ented to the Honorable A. Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> (who had his birth filled al&s;o with his trunks) the ca&s;e, that the &s;hip did not &s;ail &s;o well as u&s;ual, that &s;he was crank by having too much weight aloft, and that his trunks were in the way of two of the guns, which might prove of bad con&s;equence in a &s;udden engagement; that he might tell his &s;er|vant to put all his nece&s;&s;ary things for &s;ea in one of his trunks, which he might keep in his birth, and the others &s;hould go with mine and all the re&s;t amid &s;hip between decks, under the guard of a centry; he a&s;&s;ented to it in appearance, and I ordered not only the trunks to be put amid &s;hip, but al&s;o all the boxes of &s;mall-arms and lumber between decks to be put forward; and after all that had been done, the &s;hip was hardly in good trim.&mdash;But &s;oon after every body, from the Honorable A. Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to the &s;eamen, began to grumble at having made this change, tho' for the be&s;t, by which I perceived the whole crew was worked upon by &s;omebody or other, but I could not find out who were the movers.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="019056_0005_0FAA0D84E8AC9CE8">On the 13th in&s;t. every one but the Honorable A. Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and my&s;elf being gone to bed, he a&s;ked me what I wanted to do by cha&s;ing every ve&s;&s;el we met with in our way? I an&s;wered, I wanted to fulfil my fir&s;t orders from the Navy-Board of Bo&s;ton, which were to take or de&s;troy all the enemy's ve&s;&s;els I could. His next que&s;tion was, whether I would attack an Engli&s;h frigate of the &s;ame force we were? I &s;aid yes, by all means; that we were provided with all things for that purpo&s;e, and better manned than an Engli&s;h frigate of the &s;ame rate, therefore we &s;hould have a good chance to take her. He &s;aid, he advi&s;ed me to the contrary, and even to avoid and fly before any enemy's &s;hip, and con&s;ider whom I had on board; that I had two Aids de Camp, and the Secretary of the Marquis de la Fayette, and how unhappy it would be if they or other pa&s;&s;en|gers had an arm &s;hot off. I replied, I would be very &s;orry if any body on board met with any accident whatever; but that the dangers to which every per&s;on mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be expo&s;ed in the frigate, &s;hould have been con&s;idered before they came on board:&mdash;And ob&s;erved, that tho' the Alliance was fitted out on purpo&s;e to carry over to France the Marquis de la Fayette, I had orders to attack, engage and take any &s;hip from the enemies I could meet with, and the Marquis him&s;elf was never again&s;t it, but quite to the contrary.&mdash;Then he &s;aid, but what would be the fate of my &s;ervant, if he had an arm &s;hot off? I told him, I knew not what the fate of his &s;ervant would be, but that I &s;uppo&s;ed when he took him in his &s;ervice, he had warned him of the dangers he might undergo, and pay him in con&s;equence. But &s;aid he, have you reflected what a lo&s;s it would be to America, if the Alliance &s;hould be taken? Yes, &s;ir, &s;aid I, and I conceive it would be a great one; But if an American man of war always run away before an Engli&s;h one, &s;he ne|ver can take the latter; and if the latter cha&s;e and can come up with the former, &s;he mu&s;t natu|rally take her, as the crew in the &s;hip that runs away lo&s;es half their courage, while the crew of the other &s;hip who cha&s;es gains it, by imagining &s;ome rea&s;ons to be the cau&s;e of her flight.&mdash; Finding he could not convince me by the&s;e rea&s;ons, he tried another way, &s;aying, that if he were in my place, he would think of nothing but &s;ailing as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible to Philadelphia, becau&s;e, tho' my ca&s;e was never &s;o good again&s;t Captain Jones, if he arrived there before me, he and his friends would make the &s;tory again&s;t me take ground; but if I arrived fir&s;t, it would be the contrary. I replied, that on all occa&s;ions I would venture my life for the good of the &s;ervice, and in this ca&s;e I would even venture my reputation in di&s;charging my pre&s;ent duty; and that I relied entirely on the ju&s;tice of Congre&s;s.&mdash;Thus the conver&s;ation between us to the &s;ame meaning la&s;ted till very late, when I wi&s;hed the Honorable A. Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a good night. He appeared to be di&s;&s;atisfied with my rea&s;oning and &s;en&s;e of duty; but tho' I was very &s;orry for it, I could not comply with his de&s;ires, which were &s;o diametrically oppo&s;ite to my duty. It is to be &s;u&s;pected that he took that time when no per&s;on was pre&s;ent to witne&s;s the conver&s;ation, to &s;peak to me thus, in ca&s;e that had I complied with his wi&s;hes, he might have denied the&s;e coun&s;els after, if he had found it nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t every one, pa&s;&s;engers and officers, on board the Alliance and other ve&s;&s;els in company, wanted to keep a cour&s;e &s;uitable to his opinion; &s;ome would have gone by the &s;mall latitude, to take the trade wind, others by the middle one, &amp;c. without con&s;idering the &s;ea&s;on we were in, and other circum&s;tances. Capt. Bell, of the Luzerne, always &s;teering more towards the &s;outh than the cour&s;e given, tried to draw us in le&s;&s;er latitude.</P>
<P>The Honorable A. Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> as the headmo&s;t of the pa&s;&s;engers, was the &s;peaker who always made the motions, being certain to be &s;upported, right or wrong, by all officers and pa&s;&s;engers. One day being at table, he a&s;ked me why I kept the &s;hip in 47 degrees latitude north? I ex|plained to him all the advantages which we &s;hould derive from it, and particularly, that we &s;hould avoid the calm, and con&s;equently have a &s;horter pa&s;&s;age. He replied, that it could not
<PB N="7" REF="019056_0006_0FAA0D8578CC67C0">
be, as the &s;horte&s;t way from one point to another, was to &s;teer the cour&s;e only that lead to it.&mdash; I told him it was not always the ca&s;e, and that chiefly two cour&s;es of the compa&s;s were oftener the &s;horte&s;t way to go from one point to the other. He &s;aid, he would be glad if I would prove it and all the others laid the &s;ame. I took a twelve-pound &s;hot, and with &s;ome chalk drew a parallel &s;uppo&s;ed by eighty degrees north latitude; on it one point &s;uppo&s;ed to be the fir&s;t meri|dian, and another to be 180 degrees longitude, and &s;aid, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> way to go from one of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e points to the other, was to &s;teer north to the pole arctic, and thence &s;outh to the other point; and that the&s;e two cour&s;es were &s;horter than due ea&s;t or we&s;t, which would al&s;o lead from one of the&s;e points to the other: I allowed that we were not wholly in that ca&s;e, but by running <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver the degrees of longitude in high latitude, where they were &s;horter than in le&s;&s;er; as going upon Newfoundland and thence to Philadelphia, we lengthened but little our way, and would by the&s;e cour&s;es gather all the&s;e advantages heretofore mentioned. But all I &s;aid was out of regard and complai&s;ance to the Honorable A. Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> as I was the only one an&s;werable to a court martial for the &s;ame. Neverthele&s;s, he and the others could or rather would not under&s;tand &s;o plain a demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>On the 14th in&s;t. the wind at north by ea&s;t, and the &s;ea very &s;mooth, being upon deck before &s;upper, &s;eeing the weather braces ran in, and the &s;hip going one point large, I told Lieutenant Degge thereof, and ordered him to have the &s;ails trimmed properly, and the &s;hip kept clo&s;e to the wind, which he did. After &s;upper, when I went back on deck, I found that he had the weather braces hall'd in again, and the &s;hip going large; I repeated my order to him, but he not being rational after &s;upper, fell in a pa&s;&s;ion and ordered to brace the yards fore and aft; and &s;tamping with his foot on the quarter deck, &s;aid that I wanted to lo&s;e &s;ight of the &s;hip Luzerne, which was not a mile di&s;tant on our lee quarter. I told him to mind how he charged me in pub|lic with bad intention; he repeated the &s;ame; I ordered him to go and keep under an arre&s;t in his cabbin; he &s;wore he would not go, and no body could make him. I went to him, and a&s;&s;u|red him he had better go, or he &s;hould be forced to it. He took me by the collar of my coat, and a&s;ked whether I would force him? I ordered Lieutenant Warren, who was on watch, with two marines, to force him to go down in his birth. Lieutenant Degge left me and went on the foreca&s;tle, &s;oon after Lieutenant Warren came to tell me that Lieutenant Degge had a pike brandi&s;hing in his hand, threatening to run it through any body who would offer to come to him. I told him to follow me; when Lieutenant Degge &s;aw that I went directly to him, he let fall the pike, and got over the rail on the cathead, &s;aying, he was going to jump into the &s;ea. I went back on the quarter deck, after having repeated my order to Lieutenant Warren, who came to tell me, &s;oon after, that Lieutenant Degge was in his birth.</P>
<P>I daily perceived a great change in the crew's behaviour towards the &s;ervice and my&s;elf; in|&s;tead of the high &s;pirit, activity and obedience they &s;hewed at fir&s;t, they gradually grew remi&s;s, backward, and grumbled in proportion as the Honorable A. Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and other pa&s;&s;engers and officers grew peevi&s;h, licentious and undutiful; and I &s;aw plainly the former were enticed by the latter, but could not tell how, nor know po&s;itively who actuated them &s;o, as they kept all their proceedings &s;ecret from me: Be&s;ides, I was determined to &s;uffer per&s;onally from the Honorable A. Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> for whom I had yet the &s;ame regard, rather than to act with a right authority that would have been &s;upported by no body, thinking he would never attempt any thing again&s;t the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The Honorable A. Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and his two nephews, always kept company with Me&s;&s;ieurs De Pontgibeau and La Colomb, the two Aids de Camp to the Marquis de la Fayette, and M. Poir&eacute;,
<PB N="8" REF="019056_0007_0FAA0D87A06C81B0">
his Secretary, all three young men, who were ea&s;ily prevailed upon by the art and &s;ugge&s;tion of the former, and brought to be zealots in their party.</P>
<P>One day, as two of them were playing at che&s;s together, M. De la Colomb told the Honorable A. Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> that M. de Chavane, Captain of the French frigate the Sen&s;ible, had told him that when all a &s;hip's company agreed to take the command from their Captain, the only rea&s;on that can ju&s;tify them is, to &s;ay, all together, that the Captain was crazy.</P>
<P>Another time M. De Pontgibeau &s;aid, that when the Captain of a &s;hip was unwilling to do that which all the re&s;t wanted to be done, there was always &s;ome body that could do for him at once.&mdash;The next day after he brought his pi&s;tols from the ward-room into the cabbin, and put them in the &s;tate-room of the Honorable A. Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Mr. Poir&eacute; a&s;ked him if they were loaded? He an&s;wered they were. All that was &s;aid and done in the Honorable A. Lee, E&s;qr's pre&s;ence; who, to encourage it, quibbled, and u&s;ed double meaning&mdash;words to the &s;ame intent and purpo&s;e, but concealed his true meaning with more art and cunning than the former: But of all the pa&s;|&s;engers on board, Mr. Ludwell Lee di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in that way above the others; and be&s;ides, he altered and &s;ubverted all that I &s;aid: He had acquired &s;uch a credit on that account, and I &s;uppo&s;e in their private a&s;&s;emblies, that they called him the lawyer; and the French officers repeatedly paid him the compliment, in my hearing, that from a bad cau&s;e he would make appear a good one.</P>
<P>On the 16th in&s;t. Mr. Montgomery, in the brig in company bore away to the &s;outhward, and left us.</P>
<P>On the 17th in&s;t. at day-break, Mr. Buckley came to acquaint me of a &s;ail being in &s;ight, bearing S. W. from us. I ordered to bear upon her, and have all &s;ails &s;et. I went up and &s;aw &s;he was a large &s;hip, clo&s;e to the wind on the larboard tack, under top&s;ails only, which proved &s;he was a &s;hip of war crui&s;ing. As &s;oon as &s;he perceived we cha&s;ed her, &s;he bore away and crouded all &s;ail in a very &s;hort time to run away from us. Perceiving that the officers, far from being anxious to make all &s;ail to come up with her, were very remi&s;s at it, I told Mr. Lynd to attend and have the driver &s;et; he an&s;wered, he knew not how. Seeing his unwillingne&s;s to do it, I called a quarter-ma&s;ter, and ordered him to &s;et the driver, before Mr. Lynd. I went forward to have all &s;ail &s;et there, &s;eeing the officers were unwilling to do it; but while I was looking and ordering a &s;ail &s;et, they had another halliard let go; and it was ten o'clock, A. M. before we were under all &s;ails. We gained little upon the chace, when Mr. Larcher, followed by other officers, came to tell me that if all the trunks and boxes of arms were put aft again, we &s;hould &s;oon come up with her. Tho' I knew the contrary, I con&s;ented to it; for if I had refu&s;ed, they would have &s;aid I mi&s;&s;ed that &s;hip by my own fault. (We lo&s;t &s;ight a-&s;tern of the Luzerne &s;hip about two o'clock, P. M.) At &s;even o'clock the chace had gained from us; I then gave up the chace, and went to vi&s;it a Portugue&s;e &s;now, which had pa&s;&s;ed along-&s;ide of the chace, which he &s;aid had four and twenty guns upon her main-deck, and &s;ix or eight upon her quarter-deck:&mdash;So we mi&s;&s;ed the chance of taking a fine frigate, by the undutifulne&s;s of the officers.</P>
<P>One day, going upon the quarter-deck, I ob&s;erved for a while Mr. Living&s;ton and James Pratt, quarter-ma&s;ter, leaning together on the rail, whi&s;pering to each other. This quarter-ma&s;ter had of late, and was the only one who had, his hammock hung under the quarter-deck, in order to be found there at once when wanted, as will appear in the &s;equel. He was al&s;o the man who knocked down with a hand&s;pike &s;everal hogs, I heard &s;ince, to &s;horten fre&s;h provi&s;ions, with a de&s;ign to oblige us to go to Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="019056_0008_0FAA0D884B429180">Once, when I was walking alone on the quarter-deck, Mr. Brown, a pa&s;&s;enger gentleman of Charle&s;ton, acco&s;ted me, and &s;aid if I would give up cha&s;ing any ve&s;&s;els, all the pa&s;&s;engers to|gether would make me a pre&s;ent of a hand&s;ome &s;um of money. I looked at him with di&s;dain, and a&s;ked him if he wanted to attempt to bribe me out of my duty. They tried thus all means to in&s;nare me.</P>
<P>The Honorable A. Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> finding that I took no notice of his and others quibbling lan|guage, changed it gradually into the gro&s;&s;e&s;t in&s;ults, in order to provoke me at la&s;t to act with him with the &s;everity, it required, being &s;ure that his abettors would alter and invert all to his and their advantage, and give it out to the crew and others in their own way.</P>
<P>Once, at dinner time, he began by applying to me as u&s;ual, complaining with bitterne&s;s of all that was upon the table, the water, &amp;c. I made my u&s;ual apology, in order to &s;atisfy him, if po&s;|&s;ible, &s;aying, that there was at every dinner three di&s;hes of different fre&s;h meats, be&s;ides &s;alted ones, which I had always ordered the cook to dre&s;s to his own liking; there was al&s;o three different &s;orts of wines, punch and beer; I acknowledged the water was not good, but all that could be done to make it better had been practi&s;ed, and added, that I could not have done more for a King, had he been on board, than I had for him:&mdash;That he had cho&s;en and took the be&s;t &s;tate room; u&s;ed the cabbin as his own, diverting in it him&s;elf, with &s;uch company and whenever he plea&s;ed, whether I was bu&s;y in writing in it or not:&mdash;That at table I never offered to help my&s;elf, but as &s;oon as the meats were carved, or the de&s;ert upon table, I always ob&s;erved to hand him the di&s;hes one after another, but had al&s;o ob&s;erved that after he had taken out that which plea&s;ed him be&s;t, he handed it round the table that I might have it the la&s;t; that I mentioned that la&s;t part no other ways than to let him know I was &s;en&s;ible of his affected di&s;regard for me, ne|verthele&s;s, all that was on board was at his &s;ervice, but I could procure him no better, he &s;aid, with &s;currility, it was good enough for me, and de&s;ired I would take his &s;tate room from him; I &s;aid, it was not my intention, but he in&s;i&s;ted and repeated &s;everal times that he wi&s;hed it; I told him to give me in writing that his wi&s;h and de&s;ire was &s;uch, he &s;aid I was an a&s;s, and when in America I &s;hould have my ears cut off; I told him I knew his views in abu&s;ing me thus, that I was determined not to re&s;ent any thing whatever, when on board, but when on &s;hore, any body that would offer to fight me either with &s;word or pi&s;tols, &s;hould have a &s;atisfaction; but if any there threatened to cut my ears, I would then actually hor&s;ewhip him, and I in&s;tantly ro&s;e from table.</P>
<P>After that had pa&s;&s;ed, the other pa&s;&s;engers and officers grew altogether progre&s;&s;ively more li|centious, and the crew more undutiful.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, Mr. Buckley came at 6 o'clock, A. M. to acquaint me of a &s;ail being in &s;ight, I went up and found that &s;he was lying to on the &s;tarboard tack, bearing N. W. of us, at two leagues di&s;tance, I ordered to cha&s;e her, &s;he bore away, and made all &s;ail &s;he could &s;teering we&s;t, the wind blowing fre&s;h, I ordered a reef to be taken in the main-top &s;ail, but they were better than an hour in doing it; Mr. Lynd having gone aloft on purpo&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e to prevent its being done &s;ooner, and when it was fini&s;hed the weather earing was &s;o loo&s;e that it kept better than half an hour more before it was hauled taught to the yard-arm, during all which time the main-top &s;ail being on the ma&s;t, and the cha&s;e making all the &s;ail &s;he could bear, we gained none upon her, and an hour after a thick fog coming on, we lo&s;t &s;ight of her, however I continued the cha&s;e until noon, when I ordered Mr. Lynd, who took the watch, to have the three top-&s;ail yards lowered on the caps, and then come to the cour&s;e, which was W. N. W. clo&s;e reef the top-&s;ails; and having been wet through all the time of the cha&s;e, I went down to &s;hift my cloaths, but Mr. Lynd, in&s;tead of doing that, as I had ordered him, came clo&s;e to the wind before the top-&s;ail yards

were lowered, by which the &s;hip lay on her lee broad-&s;ide, and the main ma&s;t &s;prung: I went on the quarter deck and ordered the helm a-weather, and the three top-&s;ails and mizen clewed up, the main-top gallant mu&s;t to be launched, and preventer &s;tays to be p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, and &s;at, on the main ma&s;t, and the carpenters to fi&s;h it; the next morning the mouldings round it were made, and every thing rigged as before.</P>

<P>The main-top yard being nece&s;&s;arily lowered on the cap, and the wind &s;mall, the &s;hip not &s;teering, the fore-top&s;ail yard was al&s;o lowered on the cap.</P>
<P>Mr. de Pontgibeau went to awake the Honorable A. Lee, E&s;q, at half pa&s;t &s;even o'clock, he got up directly and went out of the cabbin. Some time after my &s;teward told me, that &s;ome of the crew being a&s;&s;embled under the quarter-deck, wanted to &s;peak with me; I &s;ent immediately for my clerk, had the regulation for the navy, with pen, ink and paper on the table, when Mr. Lynd, who had ju&s;t taken the watch, came to tell me the &s;ame, I an&s;wered, he might tell them to come five at a time in the cabbin; the Honorable A. Lee came in, and James Pratt behind him held the door open, about thirty &s;eamen were a&s;&s;embled under the quarter-derk; James Pratt &s;aid, they would &s;peak to me all at once and on the quarter-deck, and added, they would make more &s;ail, and one of the fore-top men &s;aid, let us go and make more &s;ail, and accordingly they went forwards to do it.</P>
<P>I bid my clerk to take the pen, ink and paper, and follow me on the quarter deck, where we found part of the pa&s;&s;engers, and the Honorable A. Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and the re&s;t following me: I &s;aw part of the crew who had been under the quarter-deck, hoi&s;ting the fore-top &s;ail yard, I ordered Lieutenant Elwood of the marines, who was on watch, to have in&s;tantly all the marines under arms, he did not &s;o much as an&s;wer me, but continued to walk with an air of indifference, fore and aft, by which conduct I perceived I had no more help to expect from him than from all the re&s;t of the officers who were all ab&s;ent but Mr. Lynd, who had the watch: I gue&s;&s;ed the pre|&s;ence of all the pa&s;&s;engers was premeditated to encourage the people to mutiny.</P>
<P>Though I &s;aw plainly by the countenances of the pa&s;&s;engers, and ab&s;ence of the officers, that this mutiny was concerned among&s;t them&s;elves, and carried on only by a &s;mall part of the crew, that I could not expect to be &s;upported by any body; neverthele&s;s, I thought it my duty to try all means to &s;top it, if po&s;&s;ible: I therefore &s;ent for Captain Parke, Me&s;&s;rs. Buckley, Larcher and all the other officers;&mdash;word was brought me that they were &s;having them&s;elves, &amp;c.</P>
<P>James Pratt, who was on the &s;tarboard gang-way, ordering the others how to make more &s;ail, &s;eeing me on the quarter-deck, called to &s;ome of them to follow him, and they came there; I a&s;ked him if he knew what he was about, and the con&s;equence thereof, he an&s;wered yes, and if I would not make more &s;ail, they would choo&s;e a better Captain than I was, looking at ma&s;ter Li|ving&s;ton: I told my clerk to read to them the regulation for the American Navy; James Pratt
<PB N="11" REF="019056_0010_0FAA0D8A0C4BA0F8">
&s;aid, there was no need therefor, as they knew them all being made by them; I a&s;ked his name, he told it, I ordered my clerk to write it down, as I had told him to write down my que&s;tions and his an&s;wers, but he would neither write his name, nor a &s;yllable of what was &s;aid: I don't mention all James Pratt's abu&s;ive language to me, and the &s;atisfaction which appeared in the coun|tenance of the Honorable A. Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and other pa&s;&s;engers, that part being ea&s;ily imagined, and u&s;ele&s;s to be related; at la&s;t James Pratt &s;aid to the others, let us go and make more &s;ail, the fore-top man mentioned heretofore, repeated the &s;ame, and they went again forward.</P>
<P>At la&s;t Capt. Parke came up from the ward room, I ordered him to have all the marines under arms, and if they did not obey at the fir&s;t call, to have them called name by name, as they were wrote on his li&s;t, and to write the di&s;obedience of any one that would not obey, before his name; he an&s;wered, he had not the li&s;t; I replied, he or &s;ome other officer of marine had it, he &s;aid it was in the marines birth; I told him to &s;end for it, he &s;aid he had no body; I told him then to go him&s;elf for it, at la&s;t, after he had evaded as long as he could from doing his duty on that ac|count, he &s;ent a &s;erjeant therefor: by all that conduct of his, in&s;tead of anticipating my orders to have the marines ready to &s;top the mutiny, as was his particular and immediate bu&s;ine&s;s, I was convinced that &s;aid mutiny was preconcerted and &s;upported by both pa&s;&s;engers and officers.</P>
<P>I told Mr. Lynd to go and let fly the fore-top&s;ail yard hallyards, he an&s;wered, the people had wrecked the fore-top yard ties and back &s;tays together, I told him to go and unwreck them.&mdash; Sometime after the li&s;t of the marines was brought to Captain Parke, I repeated my order to him, and went forward to Mr. Lynd, whom I told to let go one of the fore-top yard hallyards, while I let go the other, I let my &s;ide one fly, but he kept his &s;ide one fa&s;t to give time to a man to wreck it again, as he did. Though I had not been more than two minutes ab&s;ent when I return|ed on the quarter-deck, I found Captain Park doing nothing, I a&s;ked him why he did not call the marines, he an&s;wered he had, but they had all refu&s;ed to come, and he promi&s;ed he would give me a copy certified of &s;aid li&s;t, with their di&s;obedience annexed to each name, as they had been called.</P>
<P>I ordered Mr. Lynd to take all the petty officers to help him to &s;horten &s;ail, he an&s;wered, what can a man do when all are of one mind again&s;t him; though I under&s;tood very well that he meant all the officers were in the general plot, I a&s;ked if any officer had refu&s;ed to obey, he &s;aid nothing: Me&s;&s;rs. Buckley and Larcher appeared then, I told them to take with them all the officers and to lower the fore-top &s;ail yard, the former came &s;oon after to tell me, they held him and prevent|ed his doing it; I told him to give me the name of any one who had touched him, he would not, but went again forward, and came back to tell me that twenty of the &s;ailors held the hallyards and would not let them go, and added, what in the name of God can a man do again&s;t three hun|dred. (N. B.) That the only &s;eamen which appeared in mutiny, were not forty in number, that had the officers of marines, &s;erjeants and corporals took arms, they might have &s;topped the mutiny at once, and had all the &s;ea officers and petty officers oppo&s;ed the&s;e &s;eamen, they were capable by their number to &s;top al&s;o the mutiny; but in&s;tead of that I &s;urprized them &s;miling at one another, and at the pa&s;&s;engers, which made me &s;en&s;ible they were not only in the plot, but that they made ridicule of it, and of the orders I gave thereon.&mdash;Wherefore I told them I had &s;een and heard enough to convince me that they would do nothing to help me to &s;top the mutiny, that, it being impo&s;&s;ible for me to do it alone, I was going, and accordingly went down.</P>
<P>The Carpenter came to a&s;k me what he &s;hould do with the lightening rod, as he could not fix it, I told him to put it down again, and that we mu&s;t go without it.</P>
<P>Half pa&s;t eleven o'clock, when I went to ob&s;erve the &s;un at meridian, I found Mr. Living&s;ton and James Pratt walking and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ing together on the quarter-deck, in pre&s;ence of the Honor|able Arthur Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and other pa&s;&s;engers and officers, but when they &s;aw me they parted.</P>

<P>The&s;e demands of orders with regard to the cour&s;e and &s;ail which I cho&s;e to make, were new proofs that all that had been done in the morning was by the officers directions; for had the crew really got ma&s;ters of the &s;hip again&s;t the officers endeavors, when the latter had all the arms, &amp;c. at command, they would not have been &s;o po&s;itive in a&s;king my orders, when the crew had al|ready got ma&s;ters of the &s;hip, and con&s;equently of all that was on board.</P>
<P>Next morning Mr. Buckley came to acquaint me, we had &s;ounding on the bank of Newfound|land by thirty five fathom, I ordered him to fill &s;ail again, without lo&s;s of time, but not &s;eeing the &s;hip come to her cour&s;e, I went up and found Mr Buckley fi&s;hing him&s;elf with the re&s;t, I put the helm a-weather, and ordered to let fall the fore &s;ail, and make proper &s;ail.

<P>On the eleventh in&s;tant, while at table, I felt my&s;elf &s;o ill, that I got up to go to bed, one of the pa&s;&s;engers got up al&s;o, and went out in a hurry; a few minutes after, James Pratt having pa&s;&s;ed the centry out-door, without leave, opened the cabbin-door and kept it &s;o, I &s;aw about thirty men under the quarter-deck, and James Baily, with another, advanced towards my bed, told me, they came in the crew's name to repre&s;ent their home was near Bo&s;ton, and begged I would carry them there; I told them I could not comply with their reque&s;t, as Congre&s;s's order was to carry the frigate Alliance to Philadelphia; tho&s;e two men went away without grumbling; but James Pratt &s;aid he would go to Bo&s;ton, and the fore-top man, mentioned in the fir&s;t mutiny, repeated the &s;ame.</P>
<P>In the afternoon Mr. Buckley came, he &s;aid, to repre&s;ent to me that the wind, which was then ea&s;terly, might and would, in his opinion, &s;hift to the we&s;t, and then we mu&s;t be a long time be|fore we could get to Philadelphia, that the greate&s;t danger of meeting the enemies was going there, as they were very thick on tho&s;e &s;ea: I an&s;wered, that it was probable Congre&s;s had con|&s;idered tho&s;e things before they ordered the frigate to go there, and had found the propriety thereof, and it was not our bu&s;ine&s;s to pretend to be wi&s;er than they.</P>
<P>Soon after all the officers brought, (they &s;aid in writing) their opinions, which were contained in a letter as follows, viz.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>We, the officers of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">liance think it our duty to repre&s;ent to you, that it is our firm opinion, that in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the &s;hip, and from the pre&s;ent temper and di&s;po&s;ition of the people on board, it is more prudent that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;hould get into the fir&s;t Port we can make, and that it is very un&s;afe for us to continue a moment at &s;ea longer than it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;We are with re&s;pect, Yours, &amp;c.</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="14" REF="019056_0013_0FAA0D8C519509A0">I would not read this letter, telling them I had not required their opinion, Congre&s;s having ordered the frigate Alliance's immediate return to Philadelphia; I would never con&s;ent to break their order, upon &s;pecious pretences; Mr. Blodged pre&s;&s;ing me exceedingly to go to Bo&s;ton, I told him I was afraid &s;elf-intere&s;t made him &s;o urgent.</P>
<P>The officers &s;aid, and Mr. Elwood in particular, in&s;i&s;ted, that if I would &s;hew them my orders, they would cheerfully obey me in going to Philadelphia; (N. B. the Honorable A. Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who was pre&s;ent had &s;een them, as heretofore &s;aid, in l'Orient) I replied, that dutiful officers never a&s;ked to &s;ee the orders a Captain had to obey him: They then told me to go and &s;peak to the people, I &s;aid I could not, being &s;ick, and I had &s;poken to them already, and could &s;ay no more than I had, and added, were I well and to go on the quarter-deck, I think I could expect no more a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the officers to help me to per&s;uade the people to do their duty by going to Philadelphia, than I had experienced when I wanted their help to prevent or &s;top their mutiny on the 5th in&s;t. they never offered me any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but a&s;ked my orders, which I told them they had in writing, to keep the cour&s;e we&s;t half &s;outh.</P>
<P>Mr. Lynd came again &s;ome time after, repeating the &s;ame thing; Mr. Buckley had told me before about the dangers going to Philadelphia, but a&s;&s;ured me the cour&s;e would not be altered whil&s;t he was on watch; by which I was &s;till more convinced that the people were only the agents of the pa&s;&s;engers and officers, and would never offer of their own accord to alter the cour&s;e, if the others did not join with them; and in that ca&s;e, I alone, again&s;t the pa&s;&s;engers, officers and crew, could not prevent their doing it. All that had pa&s;&s;ed before three o'clock; and the officers having exhau&s;ted in vain their &s;chemes to per&s;uade me to break Congre&s;s's orders by going to Bo&s;ton, I expected they would give up that unwarrantable point.</P>
<P>All being very quiet the remainder of the afternoon, as I had much &s;uffered by a rheumatic pain or cold over all the body, when it &s;ub&s;ided late in the evening, I fell a&s;leep, when I awoke an hour after looking at my hanging compa&s;s, I &s;aw the cour&s;e was altered and kept to the N. W. by we&s;t, I got up in&s;tantly and crawled up as well as I could on the quarter deck, finding all a&s;leep but the quarter ma&s;ter and men at the wheel, I a&s;ked for the officer of the watch; the quarter-ma&s;ter went to awake Mr. Buckley, who was lying upon a gun; I a&s;ked him whether he knew that the cour&s;e was altered, though again&s;t my written order, to keep it we&s;t half &s;outh, which they had? He &s;aid yes. I told him that he mu&s;t an&s;wer for it. Seeing that tranquility which was in his countenance and all over the &s;hip, I judged it had been done by the officers and pa&s;&s;engers con&s;ent, without any compul&s;ion of the crew, and that it was out of my power to oppo&s;e it in any way, at lea&s;t until I knew how it had been carried on, accordingly I went down, expecting to learn more about it in the morning, and to con&s;ider what could be done in that ca&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 12th in&s;tant, at 5 o'clock, A. M. I &s;ent my Clerk for the ma&s;ter's log book, but it was refu&s;ed, until the evening, then I &s;aw therein that the cour&s;e had been altered wholly by the pa&s;&s;engers and officers concerted wills and agreed mutiny, and that they had given the command, as to a de&s;perado, to the already very guilty Lieutenant Degge, whom they had taken out of ar|re&s;t on purpo&s;e:&mdash;Then it was too manife&s;t, that the officers, pa&s;&s;engers and crew were all mu|tineers, the latter by the &s;ugge&s;tions of the former, and of cour&s;e it was impo&s;&s;ible to pretend to do any thing again&s;t their general revolt, had I been in a &s;tate of health to go upon deck.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s I &s;ent a written order to Lieutenant Degge, to go back and keep under arre&s;t, but he would not obey it.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Had they received and obeyed the&s;e orders, I would have a&s;&s;umed as much command as they would have let me, I &s;ay as they would have let me, as I could have it but by their own accord, &s;ince the pa&s;&s;engers, officers and crew had taken it alternately from me; and I would have tried to carry the &s;hip into Rhode-I&s;land, whence I could have given the fir&s;t intelligence of what had pa&s;&s;ed to the admiralty at Bo&s;ton and Philadelphia, and keep every one on board, until I could have an an&s;wer; but by this re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l they prevented that, and all I would have offered to do.</P>
<P>On the 15th in&s;tant, being a little better, I got up, and &s;aw one of the &s;hip's jolly boat, with James Pratt in it, towing a fi&s;hing boat on board; I went on the quarter-deck and ordered Mr. Buckley to let no-body go out of the &s;hip, and &s;tepped in the cabbin where I kept night and day a light ready to &s;eal my letter for the Navy Board, whenever an opportunity might occur, but when I came up with it, the boat was off, I called to the people on board to take my letter, they would not do it.</P>
<P>Seeing then Lieutenant Degge &s;tanding on the booms, I ordered him to go to his birth again under arre&s;t; he looked re&s;olute and undetermined until Mr. Louis Lee and Mr. de la Colomb whi&s;pered with him, after which he &s;aid, every one had put him in command of the &s;hip, and he would keep it, &s;ome other pa&s;&s;engers joining them; I &s;aw it was u&s;ele&s;s to &s;ay any more, as he would not, nor any body el&s;e, obey.</P>
<P>About an hour after, the wind being N. W. and the weather very foggy, the &s;hip being clo&s;e hauled on the larboard tack, I &s;aw from the cabbin the breakes of Shoals-I&s;lands, bearing N. N. W. within half a mile of us, I went on the quarter-deck, and ordered the helm hard a port, and to &s;hiver the after-&s;ails, which was done in&s;tantly; Lieutenant Degge then came there and ordered the crew to obey no-body but him&s;elf, to which they &s;ubmitted; I told Lieutenant Degge, that it looked as if he wanted to lo&s;e the frigate, as he ran her &s;o among&s;t the &s;hoals, he an&s;wered, it was I, and that he would fight me when on &s;hore, and the pa&s;&s;engers backed him, &s;aying, I mu&s;t fight them all: M. de Pontigbeau, being very guilty for his former conduct, then &s;poke in French, abu&s;ing me for a quarter of an hour, in &s;uch language that a porter mu&s;t blu&s;h to repeat it, in or|der to provoke me to a&s;&s;ault him before the crew who did not under&s;tand him, but he lo&s;t his time, as I did not even reply a &s;ingle word, but left him and went away into the cabbin.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Alliance came at anchor in Nanta&s;ket-Road, on the 16th in&s;t. mo&s;t of the pa&s;|&s;engers and officers went together, unknown to me, in the barge on &s;hore, and directly, to make
<PB N="16" REF="019056_0015_0FAA0D8DC4A6CFA8">
their own &s;tory good, went to the Navy Board to complain fir&s;t again&s;t me as a guilty and crazy captain, who had re&s;igned (they &s;aid) the command of the &s;hip, and added to the&s;e fal&s;ehoods all they thought could ju&s;tify their black deeds, and bring blame upon me.</P>
<P>The Honorable Navy Board might have perceived by the conduct and hurry of the pa&s;&s;engers and officers to charge me thus, that it was unnatural to &s;uppo&s;e me really guilty; as had I been &s;o, it mu&s;t &s;oon have been known without &s;uch parade, which looked rather as though they were them&s;elves guilty, they, with a preconcerted de&s;ign came to make the &s;ame agreed &s;tory, in order to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s &s;aid Navy Board again&s;t me, that they might not li&s;ten to the truth I would &s;ay af|terwards.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;engers, &s;atisfied with the credulity of the Navy Board, &s;pread &s;oon their plotted fabu|lous tale all over the town; as the &s;eamen did among&s;t the &s;eafaring men; which gained &s;o much the more credit, as I could not contradict it, being kept on board, without my power to have a boat to go, or &s;end my official letter to the Navy Board.</P>
<P>If the Honorable Navy Board had &s;ent an impartial officer, or other, from &s;hore, to &s;ee whe|ther I was really crazy or not, and if I had any thing to &s;ay in my behalf, it would have enabled them to judge with more propriety the veracity or fal&s;ehood of the pa&s;&s;engers and officers &s;tory, but in&s;tead of that they wrote a letter to Lieutenant Degge, directing him to bring the &s;hip up, which implied their approbation of his being in command.</P>
<P>I could find no opportunity to &s;end my official letter to the Navy Board, until the 18th in&s;tant, of which the following are extracts, viz.</P>

<P>It is to be ob&s;erved that the Honorable Navy Board &s;ent me a receipt without a &s;ignature to it, for my official letter to them, which letter, in all appearance had no effect with them, as Lieutenant
<PB N="17" REF="019056_0016_0FAA0D8EFB1198E8">
Degge was continued in command, and no order &s;ent to &s;ecure the two ringleaders of the fir&s;t mutiny mentioned therein.</P>
<P>I had &s;ent them word al&s;o, that I had neither men or boat left under my command, which pre|vented my going on &s;hore to acquaint them with further particulars of what had happened; but none was procured me.</P>
<P>When the &s;hip came up to Bo&s;ton, &s;he was (which was uncu&s;tomary) immediately put along-&s;ide the long wharf, as to give the two ringleaders of the fir&s;t mutiny an opportunity to e&s;cape, as they did; becau&s;e, had they been &s;topped and properly pro&s;ecuted, they mu&s;t have detected the mover of the plots and &s;ome of their accomplices.</P>
<P>Going out of the &s;hip in company with Lieutenant Brown, who had been &s;ent for me from the Navy-Board, Lieutenant Degge offered me to have the &s;hip's &s;ide mann'd. I told him I could not accept his offices, being unlawful, having broken his arre&s;t. He followed me on the wharf, and challenged me to box with him there. I told him, if he wanted to fight me, he &s;hould take a &s;word as I had by my &s;ide, then I would be his match: But as he did not like to fight this or any gentleman-like way, he made u&s;e of bad language to me all along the wharf, and left us at the end of it.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Brown being with me at the Navy-Board, we waited a long time before the Hono|rable James Warren, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Pre&s;ident of &s;aid Board, and the Honorable Arthur Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> came out of a private room, where they had, to all appearance, con&s;ulted together about the means to ex|culpate the guilty.</P>
<P>The Honorable Arthur Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> being gone directly, the Honorable James Warren, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a&s;ked me why I did not come &s;ooner on &s;hore? I told him I had let him know that I had neither boat nor men left under my command to do it, &s;ince the officers and pa&s;&s;engers had mutinied and got ma&s;ters of the &s;hip. He replied, that they &s;aid I had re&s;igned the command. I an&s;wered, they mu&s;t needs &s;ay &s;omething to palliate their guilt, if po&s;&s;ible; but it was explained in my official letter to them, that they had taken &s;aid command ab&s;olutely from me on the 10th in&s;t. and &s;ince had even refu&s;ed to receive and obey my written orders to them; and all that becau&s;e I would not break Congre&s;s's order, which was to carry the frigate Alliance into Philadelphia, and comply with their de&s;ires in coming to Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Brown then related before Pre&s;ident Warren and his colleague, Mr. Vernon, of the Navy-Board, how Lieutenant Degge had ju&s;t now challenged me to box with him on the wharf, &amp;c.&mdash;He had hardly ended his narration, when Lieutenant Warren, of the Alliance's marines, and &s;on of the pre&s;ent Pre&s;ident, came to tell his father that all the centries had left their po&s;ts, and declared they would not do duty any longer, the frigate being at the wharf.&mdash;Any body might have expected the Honorable Navy-Board ju&s;t after they heard heard of the new demeanor of Lieut. Degge to me, would have ordered by Lieutenant Warren Lieutenant Degge to be put under an arre&s;t, and would have tran&s;mitted the command to another officer:&mdash;But in&s;tead of &s;uch ju&s;t conduct, the Pre&s;ident &s;ent his &s;on, Lieutenant Warren, to tell Lieutenant Degge to declare to the marines they &s;hould lo&s;e &s;o much of their pay for every day they would omit to do their duty: which implied their continuing him in full command, and convinced me at once that I had no ju&s;tice to expect from them.</P>
<P>The Honorable Pre&s;ident Warren had in all appearance &s;everal rea&s;ons, even if he had loved ju&s;tice, to have it not done in this in&s;tance; for had it taken place, the Honorable Arthur Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> his intimate friend, and Lieutenant Warren, his elde&s;t &s;on, mu&s;t have both &s;uffered as principal; among&s;t the re&s;t of the guilty: and be&s;ides, he thought to gain popularity, in redeeming &s;o many

culprits, all which had their friends, by &s;acrificing me, being a foreigner, &s;een with jealou&s;y by all the officers in the navy; which views, I &s;uppo&s;e, made him u&s;e all means to become the &s;tronge&s;t party again&s;t me; and his colleague, tho' he had but the latter of the&s;e inducements, followed his example.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e gentlemen told me they did not under&s;tand well my letter, being too conci&s;e concerning all that had happened on board the Alliance, during her pa&s;&s;age from France to Bo&s;ton. I enu|merated it as minutely as my memory would admit, three days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, for about two hours each day, tho' my official letter would have been &s;ufficient for them.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, on the 24th in&s;t. they told me a Court of Enquiry would &s;it the next week fol|lowing, to enquire into the affair.&mdash;As I fore&s;aw it was devi&s;ed by them to have the guilty di&s;|charged, &s;hould their crime be proved ever &s;o evident before &s;aid court, that they might be received as witne&s;&s;es again&s;t me in an en&s;uing Court Martial, where, by their junto, and concerted fal&s;e evidences, they mu&s;t have me broken: and that to the contrary, had a Court Martial immediately taken place, their guilt mu&s;t have been proved, they be condemned, and their evidence again&s;t me found to be fal&s;e, and nothing but a plot, and rejected as &s;uch.&mdash;I repre&s;ented to them, that a Court of Enquiry, which was &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to find out whether there had been &s;ome fault in any body for an event which had happened, was unnece&s;&s;ary in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, wherein, be&s;ides all that I had &s;aid verbally, there were already extant charges again&s;t the pa&s;&s;engers, officers and crew, exhibited in my letter to the Navy-Board: And &s;eeing they would make no allowance for my ju&s;t repre&s;entations thereupon, I declared I would &s;ay nothing until a Court Martial &s;at.</P>
<P>All I had &s;aid on that account was u&s;ele&s;s, as the Navy-Board's plan was determined; and in con&s;equence thereof, having cho&s;en to be Judge Advocate a young man about 20 years old, whom they could command and direct to their will in their own way, &s;aid Court of Enquiry was order|ed to &s;it on the 29th Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>Said Court being opened that day, I gave them in writing the following declaration, viz.</P>

<P>I do not pretend to prove all the fal&s;ehood contained in the evidences given, by the pa&s;&s;engers, officers or crew, to clear them&s;elves and to charge me, in this court: As it is an axiom that a ne|gative of a fal&s;ehood, when it is a po&s;&s;ible thing, is impracticable without witne&s;s to the contrary! &mdash;For example, if I was alone in a place, and a per&s;on, or &s;everal in a plot, having been there
<PB N="19" REF="019056_0018_0FAA0D90B71987A0">
with me, te&s;tify that I then &s;aid or did any po&s;&s;ible thing, though I did not; having no true wit|ne&s;s (which is the pre&s;ent ca&s;e) it is impracticable to prove their fal&s;ehood, but by their own evi|dence, as the two elders were proved to be perjurers again&s;t the cha&s;te Su&s;ana.</P>
<P>Therefore, by &s;ome ob&s;ervations that I will make on that court's conduct, and on the following extracts of evidences given in &s;aid court, taken from the copy thereof, which the Judge Advocate &s;old me, I will offer to prove to the reader, and leave him to judge, the partiality of &s;aid court again&s;t me, in favor of the&s;e witne&s;s, in not trying to draw further the truth of their crime out of their own mouth; and in their judgment acquitting or at lea&s;t clearing the&s;e pa&s;&s;engers, officers and crew, as much as they could, and charging me with all their might, though they were evidently guilty of mutiny, &amp;c. and I was innocent.</P>
<P>To Mr. Degge, Lieutenant. "Que&s;tion of the court. How long was you confined?"</P>
<P>An&s;wer. "'Till the tenth of Augu&s;t, when I was relea&s;ed by invitation from the officers and pa&s;&s;engers, to take the command of the &s;hip."</P>
<P>Q. "What appeared to you to be their motive in giving you the command?"</P>
<P>A. "Becau&s;e Capt. Landais had abdicated the command, and retired to his cabbin.</P>
<P>OBSERVATION. The fir&s;t an&s;wer of Mr. Degge implies fully that he broke his arre&s;t, by being relea&s;ed by the invitation from the officers and pa&s;&s;engers, to take the command of the &s;hip, which implies al&s;o the general plot and mutiny of the pa&s;&s;engers and officers. In the next an&s;wer he &s;aid it was done becau&s;e I had abdicated the command, &amp;c. but he don't &s;ay how I had abdicated it, and the court did not a&s;k him how to prove it otherwi&s;e than by &s;aying I had retired to my cabbin, which is a nece&s;&s;ary thing to do when a Captain is &s;ick or wants to &s;leep, &amp;c. No other nece&s;&s;ary que&s;tion on that account was made, to the contrary; here follows the Judge Advocate's note, viz. "Mr. Degge being the per&s;on who took the command, it was improper to be too par|ticular in a&s;king what might involve him&s;elf, he gave therefore only a general hi&s;tory of matters, there being others who could be particular with more propriety."</P>
<P>By this note it is ea&s;y to perceive that the Judge Advocate was already acquainted with the guilt of Mr. Degge and others, as, far from following the common cour&s;e in criminal law, where the fir&s;t que&s;tion is&mdash;do you plead guilty, or not guilty;&mdash;he was afraid that Lieutenant Degge might involve him&s;elf, and di&s;cover his guilt, and perhaps the guilt of others; and by the &s;ame principle, though the officers, pa&s;&s;engers and crew were all proved guilty, he did all he could to prevent their guilt appearing.</P>
<P>Mr. Buckley, Ma&s;ter,&mdash;and acting Lieutenant. An&s;wer. "The fir&s;t appearance of any kind of di&s;turbance within my knowlege was Mr. Degge's confinement, upon which a general di&s;&s;atis|faction aro&s;e again&s;t Captain Landais, and &s;ome of the men went &s;o far as to &s;ay in my hearing, that they would relieve Mr. Degge."</P>
<P>By this evidence it was manife&s;t, that, though Mr. Degge was verily guilty, for which he de|&s;erved to be under in arre&s;t, whether with ju&s;tice I ordered him, &s;ome of the men threatened to mutiny in relea&s;ing him, to which Mr. Buckley, by his &s;ilence on a matter of that nature, gave his tacit con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Continuation of Mr. Buckley. A. "Thomas Bailey and James Pratt came to us and a&s;ked our opinion about &s;peaking to Captain Landais, upon altering the cour&s;e of the &s;hip, as &s;he then was &s;teering we&s;t half &s;out<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">;&mdash;but the people an&s;wered, that they them&s;elves would alter her cour&s;e, if we did not, and &s;aid that they would do nothing on board whil&s;t in her pre&s;ent cour&s;e, and that they had rather go to York or Halifax than to Philadelphia. (N B) &s;ince Captain Landai's orders of the &s;eventh, he never took any the lea&s;t command or gave an order on board to my knowlege."</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="019056_0019_0FAA0A5C319FFAC0">Q. "Did Captain Landais ever object to Mr. Degge's command?"</P>
<P>A. "Yes, three days after, viz. Aug. 15th, Captain Landais went upon deck, and ordered Mr. Degge to his cabbin."</P>
<P>By this evidence it is clear that the people went to take the opinion and direction of the offi|cers in the ward-room, and the officers in not acquainting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e in&s;tantly thereof, proved to be their &s;upporters.&mdash;Mr Buckley &s;ays, the people threatened to do this and that, but be&s;ides his keeping it &s;ecret from me when it happened, he don't name or particulari&s;e any one to the court who did it, though there is always &s;ome one in tho&s;e mutinies which are very di&s;tingui&s;hable. He &s;ays peremptorily that I gave no orders after the &s;eventh (which was my order to keep the cour&s;e to the we&s;t half &s;outh, which not being contradicted by another, was in force and extant, and even confirmed verbally on the 10th, to all the officers when they were in the cabbin though his next an&s;wer is, that I gave, three days after, order to Mr. Degge to go to his cabbin;&mdash;and he don't mention his, and all the &s;ea and marine officers, refu&s;ing the written orders I &s;ent to them on the 13th, that prove the fal&s;ehood and mi&s;repre&s;entation of his evidence, and that I had not re&s;igned the command.</P>
<P>COURT. Mr. Elwood, Lieut. of marines. Q. "Plea&s;e to relate all you know about the &s;tores, &amp;c."</P>
<P>A. "The wine was a pre&s;ent from the pa&s;&s;engers to the officers in the ward-room, I brought it, being two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ks on board, but Capt. Landais would not &s;uffer it to be put below, &s;aying that I wanted to carry it to America to make my fortune by it, on which account I was obliged to bottle about two-thirds of it, and the re&s;t give to the &s;eamen."</P>
<P>This evidence was prevented to be given into the Court Martial, as it would have been contra|dictory, and would have proved the evidence of Mr. Blodg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t about goods, to be fal&s;e, upon which they framed the &s;econd article again&s;t me, as will appear in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>The Honorable A. Lee &s;aid, "Saturday Aug. 5th, Major Pontgibeau, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aid to the Marquis de la Fayette, came into my cabbin as I was getting up, and told me that the Captain had ordered the &s;ails to be taken in.&mdash;When I fir&s;t came upon deck Mr. Brown of Charle&s;ton, South-Carolina, &s;aid to me, the Captain is going to make a civil war on board, he has ordered the marines under arms."</P>
<P>This evidence &s;hews, how quick the pa&s;&s;engers were to go to the Honorable A. Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> as their leader, to tell him I had ordered to &s;horten &s;ail, in order by all appearance that by his in|fluence he might have more &s;ail &s;at again&s;t my order; but the Honorable A. Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> don't &s;ay that he ran in&s;tantly out of the cabbin and did not come back 'till James Pratt and others followed him, and the&s;e la&s;t made an open mutiny and got ma&s;ters of the &s;hip: It may be ob&s;erved al&s;o, how they were ready to mi&s;repre&s;ent my proper orders in &s;aying I was going to make a civil war, when I ordered the marines to take arms to &s;top the mutiny.</P>
<P>Mr. Blodget &s;aid, "The officers deliberated &s;ome time before they appointed Mr. Degge to the command, altho' they had received a letter from the pa&s;&s;engers, advi&s;ing them to appoint &s;ome one immediately."</P>
<P>It appears al&s;o by this evidence, as by the former, that it was the pa&s;&s;engers who directed the officers as well as the crew to mutiny as they did.</P>
<P>Parts of the evidences omitted to be written down by the Judge Advocate, but which were taken in writing, during &s;aid court, by an Attorney, and another per&s;on I had there for the pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Lynd, acting Lieutenant, &s;aid, "The officers &s;aid, if the Captain would &s;hew his orders for going to Philadelphia, they would chearfully obey him."</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="019056_0020_0FAA0A5A12659C28">This evidence is omitted by the Judge Advocate, becau&s;e it explains po&s;itively that it was in the power of the officers to obey my orders to go to Philadelphia, had they been willing to do it; but they would not obey me, as I did not &s;how them my orders: Be&s;ides, it implies that I had not abdicated &s;aid command, &s;ince I continued to order to go to Philadelphia.</P>
<P>James Bragg, Carpenter. Q "Did you ever hear the people &s;ay that they were determined to go to the fir&s;t port in America that they could make?"</P>
<P>A. "I have heard the people &s;ay that they expected to be carried <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Philadelphia"</P>
<P>This is omitted, becau&s;e it is contradictory to Mr. L. Lee's evidence, that I had promi&s;ed the crew to go directly to Bo&s;ton. Be&s;ides, it implies that the crew &s;ubmitted by their expectation to be carried to Philadelphia, had not the pa&s;&s;engers and officers taken the &s;hip from me, and brought her to Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>Benjamin Pierce, Gunner, &s;aid, "The Captain a&s;ked me, what number of ca&s;ks of powder I thought in the way? I an&s;wered, four or five. He &s;aid, I might &s;tow them as I thought proper. I accordingly did, and informed the people they were not in &s;o much danger as they imagined, provided they were not going to Philadelphia, but to Bo&s;ton."</P>
<P>This is omitted, becau&s;e it proved that the gunner enticed the people again&s;t the Captain's going to Philadelphia.</P>
<P>Lieut. Elwood, of the Marines, &s;aid, "On the 10th, one <HI>Pratt</HI> told me, if I delivered the keys of the arm-che&s;ts up to the Captain, they would take my life."</P>
<P>This is omitted, becau&s;e it proved that &s;aid <HI>Pratt</HI> was the ringleader, tho' the Honorable Arthur Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> had made and given to the Court a dialogue, which he pretended had pa&s;&s;ed between &s;aid <HI>Pratt</HI> and my&s;elf, to exculpate <HI>Pratt.</HI> 2<HI>dly.</HI> Becau&s;e Lieutenant Elwood was guilty for not acquainting me with the threats of &s;aid <HI>Pratt.</HI> 3<HI>dly.</HI> Becau&s;e Lieutenant Elwood had not &s;aid <HI>Pratt</HI> &s;ecured in irons, as &s;oon as arrived in harbour, in order to be brought to trial. And for all the&s;e, and other rea&s;ons, Lieutenant Elwood was prevented from giving his evidence in the &s;uc|ceeding Court Martial.</P>
<P>Honorable Arthur Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> &s;aid, "I repre&s;ented to the Captain the nece&s;&s;ity of the ve&s;&s;el's &s;ailing, and u&s;ing many arguments with him, prevailed on him to &s;ail."</P>
<P>This is omitted, becau&s;e it ju&s;tified my &s;ailing from France as nece&s;&s;ary, tho' they made an arti|cle of it again&s;t me, both in the Court of Enquiry and Martial.</P>
<P>Mr. Living&s;ton, Pa&s;&s;enger, &s;aid, "He wi&s;hed to be que&s;tioned by the officers of the &s;hip,"</P>
<P>This is omitted, becau&s;e it &s;hows that the officers and pa&s;&s;engers had agree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> together upon the evidence they would give, if they could be admitted to que&s;tion one another.</P>
<P>Capt. Matthew Parks, of the Marines, &s;aid, "Augu&s;t 13th, Captain Landais &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t a letter to Captain Parks, but I would not receive his orders, as he &s;till kept him&s;elf confined.&mdash;Captain Parks then produced an order from Captain Landais, di&s;approving his conduct it not forming the marines under arms, agreeable to his orders of ye&s;terday.&mdash;Captain Parks produced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y pap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, particu|larly the order beforementioned, but the Court refu&s;ed taking any notice of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">em, &s;aying, they were of no con&s;equence to the ca&s;e in hand.</P>
<P>This is omitted, becau&s;e my letter to Captain Parks, dated Augu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> order of the 15th to Captain Parks, Lieutenants Warren and Elwood, mention<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d heretofore; which la&s;t they refu&s;ed to receive, proved them evidently guilty of di&s;obe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; and proved al&s;o that I had not abdicated the command (as they pretended) &s;ince I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ued to &s;end them my orders in writing. And the Court, tho' ordered by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he warrant to e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e into my conduct and that of the officers, refu&s;ed to receive the&s;e proofs of their guilt, being willing to acquit the guilty and to condemn me.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="019056_0021_0FAA0A5B04CE4D08">Mr. Ludwell Lee then interrupted Mr. Blodget, and informed the Court, "That Captain Landais, the night before we &s;ailed, went on the fore-ca&s;tle, and promi&s;ed the people he would go directly to Bo&s;ton."</P>
<P>This is omitted, becau&s;e it was not &s;upported by the crew's evidence as was expected, which would have proved Mr. Ludwell Lee an impo&s;tor.</P>
<P>Sailors of the Bon-homme Richard. Q. "Which of you was it ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> applied to the Captain?"</P>
<P>A. "The man that forced his &s;peech to the Captain is not on board.&mdash; N. B. Lieutenant Veazy (one of the members of the court) reminded them not to charge the ringleader, &s;aying, you were all one."</P>
<P>This is omitted, becau&s;e it would have proved clearly that I had not only the plots of the offi|cers, pa&s;&s;engers and crew, but that I had al&s;o again&s;t me, even in the Court, numbers that did not &s;cruple to &s;ay openly every thing that might prevent any one of the crew from charging the guilty.</P>
<P>Q. "Do you know any thing of the cour&s;e of the &s;hip being altered at the time of the di&s;pute of making &s;ail?"</P>
<P>A "The cour&s;e was never altered, and we knew of no orders for altering the cour&s;e."</P>
<P>This was omitted, becau&s;e it proved the evidence Mr Buckly had given that the people had altered the cour&s;e on the 5th in&s;t. was fal&s;e. Moreover it proved al&s;o, that they had no hand in altering the cour&s;e on the 11th, and that it was purely and utterly the pa&s;&s;engers and officers do|ings, without any compul&s;ion of the &s;eamen.</P>
<P>Q "Is there any one among you that Captain Landais promi&s;ed with his own mouth that he would carry you to Bo&s;ton?"</P>
<P>A. "We did not hear Captain Landais with his own mouth &s;ay &s;o, but &s;ome of the officers told us, that we were to &s;ail for the fir&s;t port."</P>
<P>This was omitted by the Judge Advocate; becau&s;e it would have proved the evidence of Mr. Ludwell Lee to be a fal&s;ehood of his own invention; and at the &s;ame time it would have proved that the officers had made them&s;elves that promi&s;e to the crew to di&s;po&s;e them to mutiny, in order to go to Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>The Honorable Arthur Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> &s;aid, "Upon the 10th of Augu&s;t, being in the cabbin, two &s;ailors came to the door, and mentioned that all the &s;eamen were at the door without, and wanted to &s;ee the Captain, he &s;aid, he would not &s;peak to them, but &s;aying they wanted to go to Bo&s;ton, he &s;aid his orders were to go to Philadelphia."</P>
<P>Though this is mi&s;repre&s;ented, as Thomas Bailey and another came to my bed-&s;ide, and &s;aid in behalf of the crew (who were under the quarter-deck, whence they could &s;ee and hear me, James Pratt holding the door wide open) to tell me they wanted to go to Bo&s;ton, as being nigh their home, I an&s;wered, I could not, as Congre&s;s's order was to carry the frigate into Philadelphia; but even as the Honorable Arthur Lee gave it, it proves enough that I had effectually &s;poken to the two men &s;ent by the crew in their pre&s;ence, and had explained that my orders, which were in con&s;equence of tho&s;e of Congre&s;s, were to carry the frigate into Philadelphia, which imply all I could have ever &s;aid to the crew, and that I had neither re&s;igned or abdicated my command.</P>
<P>Mr. Thomas Lee &s;aid, "Mr. Lynd with Mr. Living&s;ton waited on Captain Landais, who had retired to his bed, reque&s;ting him to come and pacify the men, but was an&s;wered, he had already given his orders."</P>
<P>Though this is mi&s;con&s;trued, there is &s;omething in it, as I &s;aid to Mr. Lynd I had already given my an&s;wer to two men &s;ent by and in pre&s;ence of the people, (as proved by the latter evidence) and when he a&s;ked my orders, I told him they had them already contained in my written order
<PB N="23" REF="019056_0022_0FAA0A5B76ACA888">
of the &s;eventh in&s;tant, as they really had, which was to keep the cour&s;e of the &s;hip to the we&s;t half &s;outh.</P>
<P>Therefore by the&s;e two la&s;t evidences it is &s;ufficiently proved, that I &s;poke and &s;aid all I could &s;ay to the people, and that I confirmed my former orders, in order to go to Philadelphia; con&s;e|quently that I had not re&s;igned the command, but to the contrary that I gave proper an&s;wer to the people, and continued to give proper orders to the officers.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the embittered and fal&s;e evidences given verbally again&s;t me in court, the pa&s;&s;engers and officers gave &s;ome ready wrote, which, as it was manife&s;t they were in a plot and mutiny together again&s;t me, were probably concerted among them&s;elves to &s;upport it, in order to be &s;aved from the puni&s;hment they de&s;erved, and to &s;acrifice me.</P>
<P>But above all things they gave to the court the following prepared in&s;idious piece, in order to ju&s;tify their taking the command from me and giving it to Lieutenant Degge, viz.</P>

<P>ARTICLES laid to the charge of Captain Peter Landais, by the officers on board the continental frigate Alliance.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. For not coming on deck, on the 10th in&s;tant, at &s;ea, when the &s;hip was threatened with a mutiny on board, and refu&s;ing the repre&s;entation of his officers, or affording them any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, although they all waited on him, and informed him that the &s;hip was in an alarming &s;ituation, but remained in his cabbin, and even retreated to his bed, and in effect re&s;igned entirely his command.</P>
<P N="2">2d. For abdicating his command the 5th in&s;tant, when the people were in great di&s;order and conducting &s;o as to create &s;trong &s;u&s;picion that his intentions were to promote a revolution on board.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="24" REF="019056_0023_0FAA0A5D35946670">3d. For u&s;ing unbecoming language to his officers on the quarter-deck, before the common men, &s;o as to have a tendency to make them di&s;agree, and de&s;troy all confidence, order and obe|dience on board.</P>
<P N="4">4th.

<P>The 2d and 3d of the&s;e articles or charges have been &s;o clearly proved fal&s;e, and the 4th for &s;topping to fi&s;h on the bank of Newfoundland (the next day after the crew got ma&s;ters of the &s;hip, in order to make all &s;ail to America) &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent, that the Court of Enquiry found they could make no charge of them again&s;t me; the third was likely de&s;troyed in the Court Martial. There|fore then remains only the fir&s;t of the&s;e articles which may be meant in the 3d article made again&s;t me in the Court Martial; in con&s;equence thereof, I will defer &s;peaking to it until I vindicate my|&s;elf again&s;t the articles made in &s;aid Court Martial.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t ob&s;erve that piece of the officers being without date when, or place where it was made, has been received thus by the Court of Enquiry, which would prove their neglect to my prejudice in not a&s;king where and when made; or the date when, and place where made was omitted de|&s;ignedly. But it was either made on board the frigate at &s;ea, or &s;ince &s;he arrived in Bo&s;ton, which is a very important though different ca&s;e. If made at &s;ea, all the&s;e officers were guilty of the 27th article of the regulation for the United States navy; be&s;ides of the fal&s;ehood contained in it.&mdash;If made &s;ince the arrival of the frigate, the Court of Enquiry is culpable in conniving at their plots, in receiving &s;uch a collu&s;ive piece.</P>
<P>For was &s;uch a piece admi&s;&s;ible as evidence, it may be forged and &s;igned by officers and crew at all times again&s;t a Captain, who mu&s;t &s;uffer tho' never &s;o guiltle&s;s.</P>
<P>But here follows their undeniable conviction, given al&s;o by them to the Court of Enquiry.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>WE, the officers of the continental frigate Alliance, having in body waited on Captain Landais in a re&s;pectful manner, to repre&s;ent to him the alarming &s;ituation of this frigate from the di&s;content of the people, which is now of the mo&s;t &s;erious nature, being univer&s;al, and fomented to a great degree.</P>
<P>Captain Landais refu&s;ed to receive the foregoing letter, and three &s;everal attempts were made to read it to him, but by a continual vociferous declaration, that he would neither hear or receive any thing from us, no part of it could be made intelligible to him, and we were obliged to withdraw without obtaining the &s;atisfaction of being attended to in this piece of duty, which we are con&s;cious we owed to him and to our country.</P>
<P>We did again &s;end into the cabbin, to de&s;ire to repre&s;ent further to the Captain the increa&s;ing confu&s;ion of the &s;hip, and he having refu&s;ed to hear us, pleaded him&s;elf &s;ick; and we do now, in the mo&s;t formal manner prote&s;t again&s;t the behaviour of the &s;aid Captain Landais.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="019056_0024_0FAA0A60A39EF908">And we now, with a view to pre&s;erve the &s;hip from the calamitous circum&s;tances with which &s;he is now threatened, and by the advice of a number of gentlemen pa&s;&s;engers on boards, to appoint &s;omebody to conduct the &s;hip home&mdash;think it our duty to de&s;ire Mr. Degge, our Fir&s;t Lieutenant, to a&s;&s;ume the command of the frigate, and to make for the fir&s;t port in America, as the mo&s;t &s;ure and almo&s;t only method remaining of having her returned to our country.&mdash;Accordingly Mr. James Degge, Fir&s;t Lieutenant of the frigate Alliance, is de&s;ired by us the under&s;igned, to take the command of the &s;aid frigate, and conduct her with all po&s;&s;ible expedition into the fir&s;t port in America that he can make.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Although the date of this preceeding piece is omitted, it is immaterial, becau&s;e it was devi&s;ed, concerted, wrote and &s;igned, before they took from me th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> precarious command they had left me, and &s;ince the crew got ma&s;ters of the &s;hip on the 5th in&s;tant.</P>
<P>By the bye I mu&s;t &s;ay, that the pa&s;&s;engers and officers, by their artful foregoing pieces given to the Court of Enquiry, tried to convince them of their &s;ole good intentions and dutifulne&s;s towards their country's &s;ervice, in their endeavoring to per&s;uade me to come upon deck and &s;peak to the people, and of my ob&s;tinacy in not complying with it; in having prevented the people from alter|ing the cour&s;e, and how they cautioned them of the dangerous con&s;equence thereof, and that I had abdicated the command.</P>
<P>But they own that they, the officers, by the advice of a number of gentlemen pa&s;&s;engers, ap|pointed Mr. Degge to a&s;&s;ume the command of the frigate, and to make for the fir&s;t port in Ame|rica, and really to prevent the people's mutiny in altering the cour&s;e, of their own accord and pa&s;&s;engers, without any compul&s;ion of the people&mdash;they altered it clande&s;tinely them&s;elves, at ten o'clock, P. M. the wind being fair for Philadelphia, where they could by their number force the people to go, knowing from me that the frigate was ordered by Congre&s;s to that place.</P>
<P>As to my having abdicated the command, it was proved fal&s;e, even by the evidence of the Honorable Arthur Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> that on the 10th I had &s;poken to two of the men, and had told them that my orders were for Philadelphia; which an&s;wer, though not given in all its extent, compre|hended all I could &s;ay to the people: And by Mr. L. Lee's evidence, that I had already given my orders; which an&s;wer, though not given al&s;o in all its extent, comprehended all I could &s;ay to the officers, as they had my written order of the 7th for the cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Therefore the evidence given again&s;t me to the Court, &s;o far from amounting to a proof that I had re&s;igned the command, as they pretended to make appear, is conclu&s;ive again&s;t them, and clearly proves that they had taken it clande&s;tinely from me, and given it to Lieutenant Degge, in order to accompli&s;h their real intention of going to Bo&s;ton, as they did: By which they were evidently guilty, as proved al&s;o by their own in&s;idious writing, &s;igned and acknowledged by them, given in the Court of Enquiry, of a&s;&s;embling, plotting and con&s;piring again&s;t me, in defiance of the 27th Article of the Regulations of the American Navy, which is applicable both to officers and pa&s;&s;engers&mdash;which is in the&s;e words, viz.</P>
<P>"<HI>Art.</HI> 27<HI>th. Any officer, &s;eaman, or marine, who &s;hall begin, excite, cau&s;e, or join in any mutiny or &s;edition in the &s;hip to which</HI> he belongs, <HI>on any pretence what&s;oever, &s;hall &s;uffer death, or &s;uch other puni&s;hment as a Court Martial &s;hall direct.&mdash;Any per&s;on</HI> in <HI>or belonging to the &s;hip, who &s;hall utter any

<P>They were guilty of depo&s;ing me; they were guilty of breaking Lieutenant Dogge's arre&s;t, when he was confined for a high crime; they were guilty of breaking Congre&s;s's orders to go to Philadelphia; they were guilty of breaking my written orders to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> have the cour&s;e &s;teered we&s;t half &s;outh, and altering it: They were proved guilty of all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by their own evidences, corroborated by one another, given in the Court of Enquiry.</P>
<P>The Navy-Board, on the other hand, never to my knowledge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to the Court of En|quiry, though ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, my official letter dated Aug. 15th, 1780, in which the pa&s;&s;en|gers, officers and crew were charged by me; by which th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e changes were kept out of view, that every one might be cleared to be witne&s;s again&s;t me in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eeding Court Martial.</P>
<P>The Court of Enquiry refu&s;ed to receive from Captain Parks my letter to him on the 13th Aug. becau&s;e I charged him in it; likewi&s;e my orders of the 13th, to the Lieutenant and Ma&s;ter, were not given to that Court.</P>
<P>Although the Honorable Navy Board and Court of Enquiry had both the undeniable proofs of my guiltle&s;s and dutiful conduct in all re&s;pects: The former, in my letter to them, dated Augu&s;t 15th, 1780, were acquainted that I had written to a&s;k Doctor Franklin's order, who would give me none; and the nece&s;&s;ity for &s;ailing, corroborated by the Honorable Arthur Lee, E&s;q's evidence. The latter had it contained in the evidences given by the pa&s;&s;engers, officers and crew on the one hand&mdash;on the other, they had al&s;o authentic proofs of the pa&s;&s;engers, officers and crew's plots and mutinies, contained in &s;aid letter and evidences.&mdash;Neverthele&s;s, the Court of Enquiry, in continu|ation of the partiality they had practi&s;ed all along in favor of tho&s;e offenders, and to my utter prejudice, gave the following report:
<LETTER>
<HEAD>The following is a copy of the judgment of the Court of Enquiry on Captain Peter Land<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is, viz.</HEAD>
<P>The Court of Enquiry, whereof Daniel Water, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> is Pre&s;ident, ordered for the purpo&s;e of enquiring into the conduct of Peter Landais, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> commander of the &s;hip Alliance, and of the officers and crew of &s;aid &s;hip&mdash;are of opinion,</P>
<P>That for the &s;ake of ju&s;tice to our country, and to the character of Peter Landais, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a Court Martial is nece&s;&s;ary for the trial of Peter Landais, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> touching his conduct during the late voyage of &s;aid &s;hip from L'Orient to Bo&s;ton, and immediately previous to her &s;ailing; for giving which opinion the &s;aid Court would offer the following rea&s;ons:</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1</HI>&s;t. The &s;aid Peter Landais, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> has denied the juri&s;diction of the &s;aid Court of Enquiry, in&s;tituted according to the orders of the Honorable Navy-Board for the ea&s;tern department, and therefore ought to have the benefit of a Court Martial, who&s;e juri&s;diction no rea&s;onable man in his &s;tate can doubt.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2</HI>d. If the &s;aid Peter Landais, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> is innocent, his reputation ought to be cleared of tho&s;e charges, or at lea&s;t popular reflections, under which it now labours, namely, a breach of tho&s;e orders of Dr. Franklin, which, by the expre&s;s injunctions of &s;aid Navy-Board, he was bound to obey; al&s;o a continued &s;eries of ill conduct to the pa&s;&s;engers, officers, marines and crew of &s;aid &s;hip, during her &s;aid voyage: Which conduct, it is &s;aid, endangered &s;aid &s;hip, and the lives of many valuable members of &s;ociety; which, if not noticed, might encourage future di&s;orders, and injure the public &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The &s;aid Court cannot but repeat, that if the &s;aid Peter Landais, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> is innocent as to &s;uch charges, his character ought to be rendered fully undoubted by a Court Martial.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3</HI>d. Becau&s;e the clearance of &s;aid Landais may involve the guilt of &s;aid crew, or vice ver&s;a.</P>
<P>And the &s;aid Court of Enquiry are of further opinion, that whatever the &s;aid Landais's conduct has been, yet another officer, who has oppo&s;ed him in &s;aid voyage, viz. Lieutenant James Degge, likewi&s;e re|quires the deci&s;ion of a Court Martial, and upon the&s;e points, viz. whether &s;aid Degge has or has not
<PB N="27" REF="019056_0026_0FAA0A62303990D8">
unju&s;tifiably revolted from &s;aid Landais's authority, and unju&s;tifiably di&s;obeyed &s;aid Landais, and u&s;urped the command of the &s;hip.</P>
<P>Touching the conduct of the crew of &s;aid &s;hip, the &s;aid Court of Enquiry cannot but ob&s;erve, that there too clearly appears to have been a &s;pirit of di&s;content and di&s;obedience; but when we con&s;ider how many in&s;tances of chagrine they have &s;uffered, how long they have been refu&s;ed their prize-money which they dearly purcha&s;ed in a foreign country, and which they have never yet obtained, and how long they have been de|tained from their families and connections, we allow the force of human nature, and do not at pre&s;ent recommend a Court Martial for the tried of any conduct of &s;aid crew.</P>
<P>We conceive that a Court Martial, which to an officer is oftentimes con&s;idered as a benefit, to per&s;ons of a lower order is always viewed as an evil, and we wi&s;h not to impo&s;e an evil upon tho&s;e who&s;e errors flow not from their di&s;po&s;itions.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the members of &s;aid Court of Enquiry, with all po&s;&s;ible re&s;pect, &s;ubmit the evidence which they have collected in the preceding &s;heets, with their &s;entiments and deci&s;ion thereon; and have the honor to be,</P>

</LETTER></P>
<P>I mu&s;t make the following remarks upon the foregoing report, that my rea&s;ons given heretofore of the impropriety of a Court of Enquiry taking place, (after I had given official charges again&s;t the pa&s;&s;engers, officers and crew) were good.</P>
<P>The &s;econd article was de&s;troyed in the Court Martial, except &s;ailing without Dr. Franklin's orders, which part I will explain and vindicate hereafter.</P>
<P>The beginning of the third article, if I under&s;tand it, means plainly, that the court would not clear me, becau&s;e if they had, the crew mu&s;t be involved in their guilt (which is acknowledged by &s;aid court, to be apparent) or vice ver&s;a, that is to &s;ay, if the crew are cleared, as they were connected together in guilt, they will be al&s;o connected in giving their evidence to charge Peter Landais, and then partake to make him appear guilty, which appear to have been the motive of the Navy-Board in ordering that Court of Enquiry.</P>
<P>The court recommends a Court-Martial to judge, whether Lieutenant James Degge has, or has not unju&s;tifiably di&s;obeyed &s;aid Peter Landais, and u&s;urped the command of the &s;hip (for which he was broke.) The rea&s;on why it was not recommended al&s;o to try the pa&s;&s;engers and officers, who were evidently more guilty than &s;aid Degge, having petitioned, enticed and coun|tenanced him to break his arre&s;t, and to u&s;urp &s;aid command, is the &s;ame as above; that is, becau&s;e they mu&s;t be &s;ound guilty, be condemn'd, and their evidence inadmi&s;&s;ible; but it &s;eems the court wanted their collu&s;ive evidence to be given in the Court Martial, in order to have Peter Landais appear guilty and condemned.</P>
<P>Now I have given a &s;imple Idea of the Court of Enquiry's conduct again&s;t me, and in behalf of the guilty. I mu&s;t continue to exhibit that of others and mine. As on my arrival I had wrote to the Admiralty Board at Philadelphia, an official letter, &s;imilar to the one of the 15th Augu&s;t, to the Navy-Board at Bo&s;ton. I wrote again to the Admiralty-Board at Philadelphia, Sept. 13th, 1780, acquainting them with what had happened on board, &s;ince the 15th ult. and the Navy-Board's conduct towards me, and Lieutenant Degge; and that the Honorable Mr. Warren, &s;ome days after my fir&s;t vi&s;it to the Navy-Board had told me there was a Court of Enquiry to be held; but as I knew of no &s;uch court being mentioned in the Honorable Congre&s;s's re&s;olves about &s;ea
<PB N="28" REF="019056_0027_0FAA0A634F7ED3D0">
regulations, I in&s;i&s;ted according to it, to have three Captains of men of war at lea&s;t to &s;it there, or el&s;e I would not &s;ay a word; that I conceived a Court of Enquiry might be proper on diffe|rent occa&s;ions; but when there were capital charges laid again&s;t &s;everal per&s;ons, as were in my let|ter to the Navy-Board at Bo&s;ton, I thought it required a Court Martial immediately, but it was not &s;o. Accordingly I &s;aid nothing all the time it &s;at; but if all the evidence had been fully and fairly noted, as it came from the mouths of the witne&s;&s;es, it would &s;ufficiently have brought the truth to light, and with the addition of a few pertinent que&s;tions, have di&s;covered the guilty. I begged their Honors would order a Court Martial, in which I pledged my&s;elf to prove I de&s;erved the confidence they had placed in me from the beginning to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>I repre&s;ented, that in all courts martial held in the old countries, an officer is always tried by his peers; urging, that there is little probability of that Captain's being acquitted, who is to be tried by three Captains not in command, and who&s;e intere&s;t it mu&s;t be to have him di&s;placed, the probable con&s;equence of which is that the command of the &s;hip would devolve on one or other of them.</P>
<P>I told them, that in the report of &s;aid Court, they would find that they tried to di&s;charge the crew; and indeed if the ringleader had been &s;topped and examined, I believe he would have declared the plot; but it was prevented:&mdash;And if the lawful &s;upport was refu&s;ed to the Captains of the Navy, all di&s;cipline mu&s;t be &s;ubverted.&mdash;I begged and claimed &s;everal &s;ums of money owing to me by the United States, and that I was confident they would fulfil my ju&s;t reque&s;t, that I remained on board the frigate Alliance until I &s;hould be taken out of her by force or Court Martial and paid, as I had nothing on &s;hore to live upon.</P>
<P>I wrote the following to the Navy-Board:</P>

<P>Since the Court of Enquiry had fini&s;hed, every method had been practi&s;ed to compel me to go out of the &s;hip, that if I had left her, they might have &s;aid I quitted her of my own accord, and they would have never ordered a Court Martial. In that view the mizen-ma&s;t was un&s;hip'd, and its apertures left wide open, to give an entry into the cabbin where I kept. I was warned by one of the men, to take care, for my life was threatened.&mdash;One evening, about 11 o'clock, P. M. when
<PB N="29" REF="019056_0028_0FAA0A63AEAA4A00">
going on board, I was attacked by two of the Bon homme Richard's men, who began by threaten|ing, and were coming at me; but perceiving that I put my hand on my &s;word, they de&s;i&s;ted from their attempt.&mdash;A few days after, at noon, when pa&s;&s;ing on the quarter-deck, going on &s;hore, I &s;aw Mr Buckley, Lynd, Capt. Parks, Lieut. Elwood, and other officers, &s;tanding on the &s;tarboard ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to the Long Wharf, where they were well po&s;ted to &s;ee the performance of that which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> intended again&s;t my life. I was not above ten feet from the &s;hip's &s;ide on the wharf, when a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> plank, thrown out of the main-top at me, fell within three feet of my right foot. I did not &s;o much as turn my head to &s;ee who had thrown it, but continued to walk; im|mediately after a brick was thrown likewi&s;e at me, which fell &s;o nigh that it made the gravel, rai&s;ed from the ground where it &s;truck, fly on my back; I &s;uddenly turned to &s;ee whence it came, the officers then turned their backs all at once, that they might &s;ay they knew not who did it.&mdash; I looked up to the main-top, where I &s;aw &s;ome of the &s;ailors heads, who hid them&s;elves directly. I went to the Navy-Board, to acquaint them with what had happened, and repre&s;ented the nece&s;&s;i|ty of having at lea&s;t a centry on the gang way, to prevent &s;uch doings, which the officers appeared to encourage. Their an&s;wer was, that they had no &s;oldiers to di&s;po&s;e of.&mdash;In the Afternoon Mr. Vernon told me he had enquired about the matter, and Mr. Buckley had told him it was no thing but a top-ma&s;t clit had fallen nigh me, and the brick was thrown by a journeyman of Salem, who wrought on board, but who&s;e name was unknown. Thus were palliated all tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions done again&s;t me.&mdash;Some days after I was at the Navy-Board, when Captain Barry and Captain Hacker, ju&s;t arriving from Philadelphia, delivered a letter to the Honorable J. Warren, who, after reading it, told me, in their pre&s;ence, the former was appointed Captain of the Alliance, and the latter to go in her as &s;econd Captain. I an&s;wered, Capt. Barry might take that command when|ever he plea&s;ed, and even po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the cabbin and &s;tate-room where my bed was, which was al&s;o at his &s;ervice; and that I would lay in the other &s;tate-room until I was tried and paid.&mdash; Captain Barry replied, he had a bed of his own.</P>
<P>On the 22d of September Mr. Parks, Captain of Marines, came into the cabbin, and &s;aid he had an order in writing from the Navy-Board to deliver me, which he laid on the table, and added, it was to order me immediately out of the &s;hip. As I did not believe the Navy-Board would have acquitted him without being tried, being charged by me, nor give him an order to bring to me, having others by whom they might more properly have tran&s;mitted their orders, I did not look at the paper, thinking if I had, it would have been interpreted as my acknowledgment of his being clear of the charges I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d laid again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The next day he came again to read &s;ome orders, he &s;aid, to which I would not hearken, telling him, he could not be in activity, being accu&s;ed by me in my letter to the Admiralty and Navy Board at Bo&s;ton. He threatened he would bring armed &s;oldiers to force me out of the &s;hip. I replied, if he did, being charged by me, I &s;hould look upon it as an attempt to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate me, and in my defence would &s;hoot him.</P>
<P>I begged as a favor that one of the two new Lieutenants of the Alliance, which were pre&s;ent, would go and tell the N. B. to &s;end a proper officer to declare or bring me their order, and I would &s;urrender my&s;elf to him to do what they plea&s;ed with me.&mdash;Accordingly came a corporal with two &s;oldiers, the former told me he had orders to carry me immediately to the Navy Board; I followed them, but when out of the &s;hip, the corporal told me to go thither alone.</P>
<P>Being there, I told the gentlemen thereof, I was come to them by the direction of the Corporal they had &s;ent to me, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at they wanted of me, they an&s;wered, nothing but my leaving the &s;hip; I repre&s;ented to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> again, that I had wrote to the Admiralty-Board, and had claimed to be paid the &s;ums of money which were owing to me by the United States, but had yet no an&s;wer,
<PB N="30" REF="019056_0029_0FAA0A6722E32318">
and having no money left of the &s;um I brought from France, as I had &s;pent it all, either to have a copy written of the evidence given in the court, or buying a copy of that which the Judge Ad|vocate had wrote down, &amp;c. Moreover, that knowing no-body who kept lodgers&mdash;the night coming on, I reque&s;ted they would let me pa&s;s the night in the Navy-Board, even in the entry thereof. Mr. Warren went out, and (though a few days before they had told me they had no &s;oldiers to di&s;po&s;e of, when my life was attempted by the people of the &s;hip) &s;oon returned with an officer and two &s;oldiers, whom he ordered to force me out of doors.&mdash;Reduced to de&s;pair by &s;uch in&s;olent treatment, I entreated the &s;oldiers to run their bayonets through me, that it might put an end to all the inju&s;tice I underwent; in&s;tead of that the two &s;oldiers took hold of me to pu&s;h me out, I told them to de&s;i&s;t, but being encouraged by Me&s;&s;rs. Warren and Vernon, they per&s;i&s;ted, till they had exhau&s;ted their &s;trength in vain, and at la&s;t gave up their attempt;&mdash;as &s;oon as they had left me I went out, full of indignation at the Navy-Board gentlemen's ba&s;e conduct, who did all this to provoke me to &s;ome exce&s;s, in order to make new charges again&s;t me.</P>
<P>Though the officers which were charged by me, kept on board the &s;hip until the Court Martial was held, I &s;uppo&s;e to agree upon the evidence they would give, I was turned out of the &s;hip, and afterwards in the &s;treet, without money, not knowing where to go, expo&s;ed to be met in the night by &s;ome gang of the Alliance's crew, incited again&s;t my life, or to find them in the hou&s;e where I might apply for lodging, without having even a cane to defend my&s;elf.&mdash;I roved thus from one hou&s;e to another, not finding any &s;helter, till half an hour pa&s;t ten o'clock, in the evening, when I found a negro man, who carried me to an old lady, who received me with much ado, not knowing who I was.</P>
<P>The next morning after, my &s;teward came and told me, that as &s;oon as I was out of the &s;hip, he went on board and found the officers in the cabbin, and a great deal of the provi&s;ions and &s;tores which were there, had been plundered and carried away, and two of my trunks were broke open. &mdash;I &s;ent him to fetch my trunks, where I found many things had been &s;tolen out of the two which were broke open. I found al&s;o in one of them eleven old table cloths and twenty-five towels, which had been kept there &s;ince they were &s;ent to me before I &s;ailed, (having the Mar|quis de la Fayette pa&s;&s;enger) belonging to the &s;hip. Having no pen or ink. I immediately &s;ent the &s;teward to acquaint the Navy-Board that tho&s;e things, having always been kept in my trunks, were brought to my lodging in one of them, and to acquaint them at the &s;ame time, that the cab|bin &s;tores and provi&s;ions were plundered, and that I would deliver the old linen as &s;oon as a full di&s;charge, either from the Navy-Board, or Captain Barry for the things left in the cabbin, &s;hould be tran&s;mitted to me; but neither the Navy-Board nor Captain Barry would give me &s;aid di&s;|charge, though it was one or the other fault for not &s;ending &s;ome-body to take care of tho&s;e &s;tores and provi&s;ions in the cabbin when I was forced out of the &s;hip.</P>
<P>I have been very particular in enumerating all that pa&s;&s;ed between the Navy Board and me, be|cau&s;e Me&s;&s;rs. Warren and Vernon not yet fully &s;atisfied with all the conduct to my prejudice they had kept &s;ince my arrival at Bo&s;ton; being convinced, I &s;uppo&s;e, I &s;hould in a fair Court-Martial ea&s;ily clear my&s;elf of the charges made again&s;t me in the Court of Enquity; and point out palpable charges of the greate&s;t magnitude, already known and proved again&s;t the pa&s;&s;engers, officers and crew, in order to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s as much again&s;t me as they po&s;&s;ible could, &s;aid Navy-Board malignantly and ba&s;ely mi&s;repre&s;ented what I had done by compo&s;ing the following charges:</P>

<P>Any body may judge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> impo&s;&s;ible it was for me to defend and ju&s;tify my character, when &s;uch fal&s;e, mi&s;repre&s;ented and amplified charges were made by &s;uch enemies, inve&s;ted with all the power, and judged by others who had no more delicacy, and had al&s;o &s;elf-intere&s;t to de&s;troy it.

<P>I &s;ay mi&s;repre&s;ented and amplified, becau&s;e I never refu&s;ed to receive letters or orders &s;ent me from the Navy-Board by proper per&s;ons; but twice only I refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to Captain Parks, when he &s;aid he had orders from them to tran&s;mit to me, becau&s;e I could not believe they would u&s;e &s;o improper a method (he being charged by me and not tried) to &s;end me their orders; which was the rea&s;on I did not receive their orders to quit the &s;hip.

<P>There were therefore four out of the &s;even members &s;etting in the Court Martial, who had the greate&s;t intere&s;t to have me broken, as they were to &s;ail in the Alliance, if they could make me appear guilty; but who mu&s;t be without employ, had I been acquitted and re&s;tored to the com|mand of the Alliance, as ju&s;tice required.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all the &s;even members of &s;aid Court Martial had &s;igned with all the other officers in the American navy, a petition &s;ent to the Admiralty again&s;t my commanding the Alliance before I &s;ailed in the Alliance January 6th 1779, by which they proved their jealou&s;y and prejudice again&s;t me.</P>
<P>I had much rea&s;on to complain again&s;t the Judge Advocate's conduct, during the Court of En|quiry, but to whom? No-body would li&s;ten to my ju&s;t grievances, it would have availed me no|thing.</P>
<P>I therefore &s;aid nothing on the&s;e important points; but being &s;en&s;ible, on one hand, of the di&s;|advantage I mu&s;t undergo being tried by &s;uch court, compo&s;ed of men declared thus again&s;t me out of natural prejudice, and who had &s;elf-intere&s;t to de&s;troy me, in having me condemned; and, on the other, if I objected again&s;t it, that another &s;et of officers or Court Martial would be refu&s;ed to me; and my challenging the&s;e officers might have been mi&s;repre&s;ented by my enemies, as a proof that I was guilty; be&s;ides, I mu&s;t have remained without judgment, under the di&s;graceful report of the Court of Enquiry: Therefore I was obliged to &s;ubmit with tho&s;e di&s;advantages, and told them, that I could have challenged every one of the members &s;itting, becau&s;e they had &s;hewn their prejudice again&s;t me better than two years before, &s;ending a petition to Philadelphia again&s;t my commanding the frigate Alliance, which they had all &s;igned but Captain Barry (as he had told me of it in the time.) Captain Nichol&s;on replied, that Captain Barry had &s;igned &s;aid petition one of the fir&s;t: However I continued, and &s;aid, I could have challenged Captain Barry, Captain Hacker, and two Lieutenants, out of the &s;even officers &s;itting, as they were to &s;hip in the Alliance, were I condemned; but that I was &s;o clear in my own con&s;cience, of any charge whatever made again&s;t me, and &s;o confident in the honor and equity of the officers &s;itting, that I &s;ubmitted to their ju&s;tice. I &s;oon perceived that I had mi&s;placed my confidence.</P>
<P>During the Court-Martial when there was no by&s;tanders, very often Captain Barry had words with the Judge Advocate, being &s;ure of the members prejudice again&s;t me, &s;aying he altered, omit|ted or amplified the evidences as he plea&s;ed; all which I &s;uppo&s;e was done to incen&s;e and make me interfere in it, which, had I done it, they would have readily impeach'd me with di&s;re&s;pect to the Court Martial, &amp;c.</P>
<P>During &s;ix weeks the court la&s;ted, Capt. Barry &s;everal times in the morning when the members were a&s;&s;embled, told me di&s;obliging things, to put me out of temper, and had the court opened on a &s;udden, with a de&s;ign, I &s;uppo&s;e, that I might an&s;wer him &s;ome words in the &s;ame way, of which he would have took advantage. With the &s;ame intention he &s;everal times recommended to the court to keep the oath they had given, as if it had been a &s;ecret; but I was confident, it was either a &s;nare laid to make me enquire what that oath could be, or it was really a &s;ecret re&s;olution again&s;t me tran&s;mitted to him before hand.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="019056_0032_0FAA0A68F3359A98">When I cro&s;s-que&s;tioned Mr. Lynd, acting Lieutenant, about the cha&s;e which he had given in the Alliance to a 32 gun frigate, I made him own that I having ordered him to have the driver &s;at, he an&s;wered me, that <HI>he knew not how to rig it,</HI> upon which I called a quarter-ma&s;ter to have it done before him, that he might learn how to do it. As they had made a great &s;tre&s;s again&s;t me for my ordering a quarter-ma&s;ter to &s;how an acting Lieutenant how to rig a &s;ail without explain|ing why&mdash;the Court of Enquiry, having no &s;olid foundation where to build had made an article thereupon, wherein I was impeached of ill u&s;age to the officers.</P>
<P>But Mr. Lynd, by owning his ignorance, or unwillingne&s;s to obey me, ju&s;tified my reproof thereon, and de&s;troyed that part of the Court of Enquiry's report: Upon which Capt. Barry &s;aid, I &s;hould not cro&s;s-que&s;tion thus, and moved to the court to oblige me to give them in writing the cro&s;s-que&s;tions I would put to the evidence, and they would do it them&s;elves. I repre&s;ented that I had an undeniable right to cro&s;s-que&s;tion the evidences again&s;t me in &s;uch manner as I thought be&s;t, to draw the truth from them; Captain Barry then enjoined the evidences to an&s;wer only yes, or no, by which it was impo&s;&s;ible to draw any thing from them.</P>
<P>I begged of the Court Martial, that they would a&s;k from, and have tran&s;mitted to them my of|ficial letter to the Navy Board, dated Augu&s;t 15th, 1780; but the Navy Board denied having &s;uch a letter, thinking I had nothing to prove they had it, but their receipt which was not &s;igned; but after three whole weeks denial, I exhibited a letter from the Navy Board, directing me to deliver &s;aid letter to Mr. Larcher, and the receipt for that letter from Mr. Larcher; at la&s;t it came into the court, but they took no notice of it, as it was too obvious, &s;trong and ex|plicit again&s;t the officers, pa&s;&s;engers and crew to be confuted. I will repeat hereafter &s;ome ex|tracts of it.</P>
<P>I begged al&s;o, that the court would be plea&s;ed to order Lieutenant Elwood to come and give his evidence, but I could never obtain it, becau&s;e it would have proved a-new my &s;trictne&s;s again&s;t allowing any body to have any private goods on board, and that the officers kept from me the plots and threats they knew of the mutineers, but the court's intention was not to &s;ummon him to come, as his evidence given in the Court of Enquiry would have prevented two articles which the Court Martial made again&s;t me.</P>
<P>When the court had received all the evidences they thought fit again&s;t me, I applied to them for a warrant to oblige Stephen Wates, Captains &s;teward, to come and give his evidence, as the &s;aid Stephen Wates had given me in writing that Lieutenant Living&s;ton, one of the pa&s;&s;engers, had given to James Pratt, (the ringleader who had carried on the fir&s;t mutiny on board) &s;ix guineas, and a &s;uit of new cloaths, and had told me moreover, that the other pa&s;&s;engers had given to &s;aid James Pratt &s;ome money al&s;o; and that whenever he &s;hould be ordered, he would give his evidence more exten&s;ively thereon, and on other &s;imilar material points.</P>
<P>The Judge Advocate went him&s;elf to Salem, in &s;earch of Stephen Wates, in order to &s;peak to him, though I objected as much a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I could again&s;t his going; but I &s;ent word to Stephen Wates by Mr. Vary, (the Salem Stage's owner) to come to the court next Monday following, to give his evidence. Mr. Vary having delivered his errand to Stephen Wates before the Judge Advocate had found him, told me after, that Stephen Wates had told him, he would come and tell the truth, for which the officers of the Alliance mu&s;t &s;uffer. But after the Judge Advocate had found and had &s;poke to Stephen Wates, the ca&s;e was quite altered when he gave his evidence in the court; for be &s;aid that the &s;ix <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uineas and &s;ait of new cloaths, which Lieutenant Living&s;ton had given to James Pratt, were given as a reward to the latter, for landing the former's t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">unk, and &s;aid no more.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="019056_0033_0FAA0A69B25EF948">That witne&s;&s;es being thus tampered with, and evidence of the adver&s;aries perverted, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed and mi&s;repre&s;ented to their advantage, it is ea&s;y to conceive what mu&s;t be my &s;tate.</P>
<P>Having had no copy of the evidences given to the court during &s;even weeks again&s;t me, it being impo&s;&s;ible for me to recollect all that had been &s;aid, I made the following reque&s;t, viz.</P>

<P>But the court would neither order a copy of the evidence, nor of the new charges given in it, to be given me to make my defence by. I was therefore compelled to tru&s;t to my memory for what I recollected, and to Providence for the re&s;t.</P>
<P>I began my defence by demon&s;trating obviou&s;ly that the evidences of the pa&s;&s;engers and officers given again&s;t me were inadmi&s;&s;ible. As it was con&s;picuous they were proved guilty by their own in&s;idious in&s;truments produced by them in the Court of Enquiry, which condemned them without tryal, one &s;igned by the Honorable Arthur Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and all the other pa&s;&s;engers, peti|tioning the officers to name one to take the command of the Alliance from me, though <HI>there was then extant a written order from me,</HI> which the officers a&s;&s;ented to; by another they &s;igned al&s;o, which was given likewi&s;e in &s;aid court; and in connection of their common guilt, they gave the command to Lieutenant Degge, by which they broke his arre&s;t, <HI>broke the &s;aid extant written order for the cour&s;e to be kept we&s;t half &s;outh for Philadelphia; according to the order of Congre&s;s;</HI> and in|&s;tead of that came to Bo&s;ton; and their preten&s;ions, as an excu&s;e of my having re&s;igned the com|mand, proved fal&s;e by my &s;aid written order, as one of their own evidences had acknowledged that I had told them that I had given my orders, and by the other written orders I &s;ent them after, which they refu&s;ed to receive on the 13th Augu&s;t, it was coroborated that I never &s;howed the lea&s;t inclination to re&s;ign my command; and what proves it more &s;till, is their taking it from me clande&s;tinely in the night; therefore being proved thus connectedly guilty again&s;t my orders, commands, and con&s;equently again&s;t me, their evidence could be look'd upon but as a &s;eries of their connected guilt again&s;t me, con&s;equently could have no force, credit or validity again&s;t me; moreover their evidence again&s;t me mu&s;t be con&s;idered as an expedient to palliate their crime, in

charging me, and &s;atiate their animo&s;ity in having me condemned, by which means my evidence could not be turned again&s;t them.</P>
<P>I exhibited my letters to his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> previous to my re&s;uming the command on board the Alliance at l'Orient, and tho&s;e I wrote to him after, and his receipts there|for, the letter from the officers of the Alliance to entreat me to re&s;ume my command on board of her, and the opinion in writing of the Honorable Arthur Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and of commodore Gillon of my right and duty to re&s;ume it.</P>
<P>I declared that the Honorable Arthur Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> wanted me to have his po&s;t chai&s;e brought in the &s;hip, that being not practicable, the &s;hip being too full when I re&s;umed my command; I told him to &s;ell it, and with the amount to purcha&s;e &s;ome &s;ilks, &s;tuffs, or even a box of tea, that I thought Congre&s;s would not di&s;approve it, but that he refu&s;ed my offer; that there were brought on board the &s;hip, three &s;mall boxes, belonging to the French Mini&s;ter at Philadelphia, whereof I had ac|quainted the Admiralty there, and the Navy Board at Bo&s;ton as &s;oon as arrived.</P>
<P>I prote&s;ted I never gave any permi&s;&s;ion to Mr. Blodget to bring any goods in the Alliance, and that might be verified by the Ma&s;ter's book.</P>
<P>I exhibited the letter of the Honorable Arthur Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to me, on the exigency of &s;ailing for America, and enumerated the concurring rea&s;ons for it, and dangers the frigate underwent, which made it nece&s;&s;ary, be&s;ides Congre&s;s's order for her immediate return to Philadelphia, of which I had a copy; all rea&s;ons which ju&s;tified my &s;ailing in her from L'Orient, having had no order to the contrary from Dr. Franklin, though I had advi&s;ed him of my intention to fulfil Congre&s;s's order, of which I had received a copy; but he would neither give me any to &s;tay or to &s;ail, which implied his tacit approbation to &s;ail.</P>
<P>I gave the rea&s;ons why Captain Parks was put under arre&s;t, and that he was relea&s;ed therefrom as &s;oon as he a&s;&s;ented to do his duty. I gave al&s;o the rea&s;ons why Lieutenant Degge was ordered and kept under arre&s;t, till he broke them to u&s;urp the command from me.</P>
<P>I related how the peevi&s;hne&s;s and bad humour of the Honorable Arthur Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> (and of other pa&s;&s;engers and officers by his example) began a few days after we &s;ailed from Europe, and progre&s;&s;ively augmented di&s;puting with me, on account of all the victuals brought upon the table, even with the cour&s;e and police of the &s;hip, and after his quibblings and in&s;ulting words to me at table. How he enticed me not to give cha&s;e to the &s;ails we met with, but even to avoid them&mdash; How the crew became more and more undutiful, the cau&s;e of which I could not prevent, nor even know, as the officers kept from me all the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the crew, which they heard, and which they have given in as their evidences to the Court of Enquiry. I &s;ubmitted the cour&s;e I had or|dered to be kept, to the Court's judgment, giving them the rea&s;ons why I kept it thus, and proved I had always ordered proper &s;ail to be made. I related how I was not obeyed nor &s;econded by the officers in making &s;ail, when we cha&s;ed a 32 gun frigate, and &s;ome days after a brig.</P>
<P>I produced the certificate of the Carpenter, how the &s;ail was &s;hortened on the 6th of Augu&s;t, 1780, in order to fix a lightning-rod to the main-top-royal-ma&s;t head, when &s;ome of the crew a&s;&s;embled, and wanted to &s;peak to me; that I &s;ent them word to come five at a time in the cabbin to do it; that James Pratt, who headed about 30 of them, &s;aid he would not, but they would &s;peak to me all at once on the quarter-deck; and &s;aid to the other, let us go and make &s;ail;&mdash; that one of the foretop-men repeated the &s;ame words, and accordingly they went forward;&mdash;that I told my Clerk to take with him pen, ink, and paper, and the Regulation for the American Navy, and follow me on the quarter-deck, where I found the pa&s;&s;engers already a&s;&s;embled together, and &s;aw part of the crew forward in an open mutiny, making &s;ail; that the fir&s;t word I uttered was to Mr. Elwood, Lieutenant of Marines on watch, whom I ordered to have all the marines in&s;tantly
<PB N="36" REF="019056_0035_0FAA0CF638FC2668">
under arms; that he would nor do it; that there being but Mr. Lynd, acting Lieutenant, upon watch, I &s;ent orders to Captain Parks and all the other officers to come upon deck; that word was brought me, that they were &s;having, &amp;c. and they came not till long time after; that James Pratt, who commanded and directed the others how to &s;et the &s;ails, came from the gang-way upon the quarter-deck, followed by a number of &s;eamen; that I &s;poke to them in the be&s;t manner I could to impre&s;s them with a &s;en&s;e of duty; that I told my Clerk to read to them the Regulations for the Navy; James Pratt's an&s;wers, and his threats to choo&s;e another Captain; that I ordered my Clerk to take down what he &s;aid, and his unwillingne&s;s to do it; how &s;aid Pratt went again with the other &s;eamen to make more &s;ail, &amp;c. that Captain Parks being come at la&s;t, I ordered him to have all the marines under arms, and if any refu&s;ed, to call them by their names, and if they would not obey, to write their di&s;obedience on the li&s;t before their names;&mdash;how at fir&s;t he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d to elude my order and never performed it, and that he promi&s;ed me a copy of the marines refu&s;al to obey; that I went my&s;elf to Mr. Lynd forward, in order to lower the fore top&s;ail; how, in fine, after I had given all po&s;&s;ible and proper orders to have the mutiny &s;topped, &s;eeing I was &s;econded by nobody; having heard Mr. Lynd &s;ay, "<HI>What can a man do again&s;t</HI> 300 <HI>that are of the &s;ame mind?</HI>"&mdash;Mr. Buckly &s;ay, "<HI>What, in the name of God, can a man do again&s;t three hundred?</HI>" which were hints that I was alone again&s;t all on board, which were of the &s;ame mind:&mdash;Not obey'd by officers of marines, as I could do no more, the crew being ma&s;ters of the &s;hip, and I could not take it alone my&s;elf from them, I went down.</P>
<P>I related, that when I went to ob&s;erve the &s;un at meridian, I &s;aw Lieutenant Living&s;ton and James Pratt walking together on the &s;tarboard &s;ide of the quarter-deck, but perceiving me, they parted; how the &s;ame afternoon Mr. Buckly and others came to tell me the cour&s;e was altered, though it had not been, and they a&s;ked my orders.</P>
<P>How the next day after the mutiny for making more &s;ail, having &s;oundings, I ordered Mr. Buckly to fill again; but in&s;tead of that I found him fi&s;hing, and was compelled my&s;elf to put the helm a-weather.</P>
<P>I &s;howed the certificate of Mr. Pool, of the 6th of Augu&s;t, how I had &s;ent him to a&s;k Captain Parks to &s;end me a copy, certified by him, of the li&s;t of the marines as they were called to take arms the day before, with their refu&s;al before their name, which Captain Parks refu&s;ed to give, &s;aying, he was not my clerk.</P>
<P>I likewi&s;e &s;howed my letter and order to him of the &s;ame day, and on the &s;ame topic, by which I upbraided and charged him of having not done his utmo&s;t on the preceding day, to have the marines under arms, as I had ordered him, in order to &s;top the mutiny; and I fini&s;hed it by or|dering him to have &s;aid li&s;t made, an exact copy of the one they were called by, and their refu&s;al to obey wrote before their name, and tho&s;e who were centry then mentioned, and that it &s;hould be &s;igned by him and delivered to me:&mdash;Which order I &s;ent him by Mr. Warren, Lieutenant of Marines, who&s;e receipt I produced.</P>
<P>I exhibited my written orders, given on the 7th Augu&s;t 1780 to Me&s;&s;rs. Buckley, Lynd and Larcher, to have the cour&s;e &s;teered we&s;t half &s;outh, until I &s;hould order to alter it, which was the due cour&s;e to the entry of the Delaware, and which order was extant and in force when the &s;hip was taken from me. I related, that on the eleventh in&s;tant, being taken &s;uddenly &s;ick at table, I aro&s;e in order to go to bed, that a pa&s;&s;enger at the &s;ame time in a hurry, (though dinner was not ove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">) went out of the cabbin; that &s;oon after James Pratt pa&s;&s;ed without being oppo&s;ed by the centry at the cabbin door, and without leave opened and held the cabbin door &s;o, whil&s;t James Baily and another came towards my bed, and &s;aid, they came in the crew's, name, who were un|der the quarter-deck, to a&s;k me to go to Bo&s;ton; that I an&s;wered I could not comply with their

<P>That afterwards all was quiet, and by all what I had &s;een and heard, I was confident to a cer|tainty that the people would never alter the cour&s;e, had the officers been aver&s;e to it, but I &s;u|&s;pected both pa&s;&s;engers and officer had &s;elf-intere&s;t to prevent the &s;hip's going to Philadelphia, for fear the fir&s;t mutiny would be &s;earched thorougly into there, where they were in &s;ome re|&s;pects &s;trangers more than in Bo&s;ton; &s;o that in fact, without any compul&s;ion of the crew, the of|ficers and pa&s;&s;engers of their own accord having a&s;&s;embled, concerted and collectively agreed to take the command from me; and they had, at ten o'clock in the night, without any noi&s;e, clan|de&s;tinely altered the cour&s;e, and made it for Bo&s;ton; all which proved obviou&s;ly at the &s;ame time my willingne&s;s to keep the command, and the preconcerted wilful mutiny of the pa&s;&s;engers and officer and their plot to take &s;aid command from me. That as &s;oon as I perceived it I crawled as well as I could upon deck, found Mr. Buckly quiet in mind a&s;leep, lying upon a quarter-deck gun; that I called to him, and being awoke by the quarter ma&s;ter, told him to mind the cour&s;e was altered, he an&s;wered very well, I told him he &s;hould an&s;wer for it; that &s;eeing plainly it was done by the officers and pa&s;&s;engers, I judged it was impo&s;&s;ible to recal them to any &s;en&s;e of honor to which they were lo&s;t and, not being able to have evident proofs how this affair was tran&s;|acted until next day, and &s;uffering a rheumatic pain all over the body I went down.&mdash;Next morn|ing I &s;ent for the log-book, which was refu&s;ed, I could not obtain it until late in the evening, when I &s;aw it I found the mutiny had heen carried on as I had fore&s;een, by the pa&s;&s;engers and officers connected together, who had cho&s;en Lieutenant Degge to command the &s;hip: that it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to do any thing again&s;t pa&s;&s;engers, officers and the crew, which latter were &s;e|duced by the former; that I &s;ent an order to Lieutenant Degge to keep under arre&s;t&mdash;then I pro|duced al&s;o the order of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">3th in&s;tant, to the three acting Lieutenants, and the order to the Captain and two Lieutenants of marines, which they all refu&s;ed to receive.&mdash;That being &s;ick&mdash;&s;till no-body that would obey my orders, I kept below, as it would have been u&s;ele&s;s for me to offer to do any thing again&s;t every one on board, had I been well.&mdash;That on the 16th, being better, I got up and &s;aw one of the &s;hip's boats out, with James Pratt in her, who went and brought on board a fi&s;hing boat, I went upon the quarter-deck, where &s;eeing Lieutenant Degge, I ordered him again under arre&s;t, but he would not go. I went down to &s;eal my official letter to the Navy-Board of Bo&s;ton, but coming up again the fi&s;hing boat was off, and her people refu&s;ed to take my letter, that &s;ome time after, hearing a noi&s;e, I looked out of one of the ports, &s;aw the breakers in the winds eye by the larboard bow, went up and ordered the helm a-weather, when Lieutenant Degge com|ing up, ordered the people to obey no-body but him&s;elf, threatened me when on &s;hore, and all the pa&s;&s;engers joined with him, (in particular a French one) till I went down; that being at an|chor in Nanta&s;ket-Road, the barge went to Bo&s;ton with the pa&s;&s;engers and officers, without my knowledge, and that I could not have my letter tran&s;mitted to the Navy-Board until the 18th; and I told the court, that there was even in the evidence given by men, who were connected in

the concerted plot again&s;t me proof enough that I had done all I could po&s;&s;ibly do for the good of the &s;ervice; but my orders being prevented taking place by their general oppo&s;ition, di&s;obedience and mutiny, I had detected them and told them all I knew about it, either in writing or verbally.</P>
<P>As to the charges made again&s;t me by the Honorable Navy Board, ea&s;tern department, at Bo&s;ton, I &s;aid that Captain Barry, who &s;at then pre&s;ident in the court, knew that I had never oppo&s;ed his commanding the Alliance, nor interfered with it by words or facts whatever; that he knew al&s;o, that the old table linen, which had been brought to me at my lodging in one of the trunks, I had offered to deliver him as &s;oon as he, or the Navy Board would give me a general di&s;charge for the &s;tores and provi&s;ions that were in the cabbin when I was ordered out of her; that I never refu&s;ed to receive and &s;ubmit to their orders when con&s;i&s;tent with equity, rea&s;on and the regula|tions of the navy; that it was proved I had received and &s;ubmitted to their &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, and had delivered &s;ome wine and other articles to Captain Ba&s;s by their verbal order only, and had left the &s;hip as &s;oon as they had &s;ent me their verbal order by a proper channel&mdash;but that I had I been unwilling to &s;peak in the Court of Enquiry, it being incon&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on and the regulation of the Navy, as there were real charges again&s;t the pa&s;&s;engers, officers and crew contained in my official letter to the Navy-Board at Bo&s;ton, dated Augu&s;t 15, 1780; that I had refu&s;ed their orders by Captain Parks, as he was charged by me and not try'd, con&s;equently not acquitted, and of cour&s;e not till then in a capacity to act, that I earne&s;tly de&s;ired pa&s;&s;ing a night in the Navy-Board entry, not knowing where to go, and being expo&s;ed to the fury of a crew exa&s;perated again&s;t me, which they knew had attempted my life already, and that it was as iniquitous, cruel and di&s;graceful in them, as humiliating for me, when I had no money, (though &s;o much due to me by the United States) to be forced in the &s;treets in a country where I had no &s;ecurity for my life, nor credit, without affording me any means to be lodged and have &s;ub&s;i&s;tance (as ought to have been done, and the co&s;t thereof deducted out of the money owing to me) until I was tried.</P>
<P>The Court ro&s;e and parted, without being willing to &s;tay till the Judge Advocate had verified &s;everal orders and other papers contained in part of my defence, or rather the confe&s;&s;ion I had given the Court in writing, and I had others which I had only mentioned in the Court, that I wanted al&s;o to be verified by him; but being <HI>dinner-time, he &s;aid he could not &s;tay, &s;o it ended there.</HI></P>
<P>Not being able to learn in Bo&s;ton the judgment of the Court Martial concerning my trial, I wrote to the Admiralty, and begged from them to let me know my fate, but had no an&s;wer: I determined to go my&s;elf in May, in order to know it.&mdash;Being there, I applied to the Admiralty Board; they &s;aid they could tell me nothing about it.

<P>Having been condemned by the above &s;entence, following four &s;pecious articles, made by an unanimous Court-Martial, there remains to prove, by re&s;uming the rea&s;ons given in my defence, and the parts of the evidences which ju&s;tify my conduct, and de&s;troy tho&s;e articles; that the &s;aid Court was either wilfully unju&s;t, or incapable in their judgments: And that I was clear and innocent of the charges contained in the articles preceding &s;aid &s;entence. I am not bound to prove negatives; but by all that I will gather from the circum&s;tances, and of the evidences given, I will prove the fal&s;ity of them.</P>
<P>With regard to the fir&s;t article,</P>
<P>When I re&s;umed my command on board the Alliance frigate, in the road of Penmaneck, at L'Orient, on the 13th June, 1780, according to her officers and crew's reque&s;t, and the opinion of Commodore Gilion and the Honorable Arthur Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of my duty and right thereon&mdash;The frigate was ready loaded, having her hold full, be&s;ides 67 boxes of mu&s;kets between decks. The crew was employed at that time to bend her three top&s;ails to the yards; and Captain Jones had told the officers that very day, he was going to America as &s;oon as the &s;hip could be ready to &s;ail; which implied he had Doctor Franklin's orders &s;o to do. By the letter of John Brown, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Secretary of the Admiralty, to me, I was acquainted with Congre&s;s's orde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for the Alliance's im|mediate return to Philadelphia. In order to accompli&s;h which I wrote, June 15th and 16th, to
<PB N="40" REF="019056_0039_0FAA0CFA023C6B10">
his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> (which are in the fir&s;t part of this memorial) that I had re&s;umed my command, would make all po&s;&s;ible expedition to have the Alliance ready to &s;ail for America according to Congre&s;s's order (which I imparted to him) and a&s;ked his in con&s;equence; by which conduct it is proved that though he had previou&s;ly u&s;ed me with manife&s;t inju&s;tice, I did not forget my duty to him and the &s;ervice; but he would give me no other an&s;wer but <HI>leave the &s;hip immediately,</HI> which was no order, but a continuation of his abu&s;e of power, and of cour&s;e tyranny towards me.</P>
<P>As he had given me no order &s;ince I had re&s;umed my command, I could not di&s;obey them; for where there is no order there can be no di&s;obedience; but to the contrary, as he had probably given orders to Captain Jones to &s;ail in the Alliance for America as &s;oon as ready; as I had ac|quainted him with the order of Congre&s;s for the Alliance's immediate return to Philadelphia, and my willingne&s;s to fulfil them being coincident together, his &s;ilence, and no order to the contrary was his tacit con&s;ent, that I &s;hould &s;ail according to Congre&s;s's order, as it is an axiom incontro|vertible in that ca&s;e, that my &s;ailing according to Congre&s;s's order not being prohibited, was per|mitted. Therefore if any one was guilty for my &s;ailing without order from France, as his Excel|lency B. Franklin could have his orders tran&s;mitted to me in five days time, and that I waited for them from the 14th June till the 8th of July, it was his Excellency's fault, as he would give me none, being exa&s;perated that in vain he had done all he was capable of to take me out of com|mand, in order to place Captain Jones, knowing that had he given me any order con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;ervice, it would have ju&s;tified my having re&s;umed the command and put me in a &s;tation and &s;ituation, whence I might have &s;hewed his previous abu&s;e of power towards me.</P>
<P>But in this ca&s;e would not any equitable court have judged, being deprived of his Excellency's order, whether it was not better to &s;ail for America as I did, when I knew Congre&s;s's order for the Alliance's return, and that it was probable his Excellency had given &s;imilar orders to Captain Jones: when all circum&s;tances and dangers heretofore enumerated, which the frigate underwent, concurred to make her &s;ailing nece&s;&s;ary, or to &s;tay always for his orders to &s;ail, which in all appear|ance he would never have given me.</P>
<P>Had I &s;tay'd, a court with ju&s;tice might have &s;aid, that I was guilty for &s;taying in France with|out permi&s;&s;ion of his Excellency Benjamin Franklin and again&s;t Congre&s;s's order to carry the &s;hip immediately to Philadelphia, which I knew and all other circum&s;tances which concurred to make her &s;ailing nece&s;&s;ary,&mdash;moreover the court which condemned me, acknowledged in the &s;aid ar|ticle, that I had motives and advice which urged me to &s;ail, but they could not &s;ay that I had any to &s;tay.</P>
<P>Therefore of the two, of which one mu&s;t unavoidably be done, I determined on the only one ju&s;tifiable. According to this precedent, whenever a &s;uperior will have an inferior found guilty, he will be &s;ure of the means by giving him no orders, as the inferior mu&s;t do &s;omething, or re|main &s;till, in either of which ca&s;es he will be condemn'd for having done it or remained &s;till without his &s;uperior's permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>With regard to the &s;econd article.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, there was no goods belonging to me brought in the Alliance, and it is not probable I would have &s;uffered any there belonging to others, when I had orders to the con|trary.</P>
<P>In the Court of Enquiry, no-body had mentioned that any goods had been brought in the Al|liance. But in the report of &s;aid court it was &s;aid, that <HI>"the clearance of Captain Landais might involve the guilt of the crew, &amp; vice ver&s;a,"</HI> by which it may be under&s;tood, that I mu&s;t be con|demn'd, otherwi&s;e the crew mu&s;t be involved in their own guilt; and as they knew they could

<P>This evidence, tho' artfully contrived to make me appear guilty, &s;hows its de&s;ign and fal&s;ehood at fir&s;t examination; for had I really given Mr. Blodget any con&s;ent whatever to his &s;hipping goods on board the Alliance, it is unnatural to &s;uppo&s;e that of his own accord, four months after the arrival of the Alliance, he would have confe&s;&s;ed his own guilt of bringing goods, which would have proved his ingratitude, without alleviating his crime.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that in the foregoing que&s;tions of the Court, which were chiefly put to the evidence by Captain Barry, or the Judge Advocate, and in the an&s;wers to them made by Mr. Blodget, that neither are made or an&s;wered directly to know or prove, 1&s;t, That I was in command of the Alliance when Mr. Blodget &s;poke to me about goods. 2d. Whether or not I gave him leave to bring goods in the &s;hip&punc; To the contrary, the que&s;tions are made for the indirect an&s;wers given; as if they had been agreed upon, and what que&s;tions they would make, and what the evidence &s;hould an&s;wer, in order to make me appear guilty: And by the addition of a few inter|lined words to the written evidence, prevent me of the right to cro&s;s-que&s;tion on tho&s;e material points.</P>
<P>(N. B.) In the 6th que&s;tion, if the interlined words (<HI>or knowledge</HI>) were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, there re|mains an indirect an&s;wer; as I may have even <HI>knowledge</HI> of a thing, and yet not <HI>con&s;ent</HI> to it.</P>
<P>In the 7th que&s;tion, if the interlined words, <HI>I depend upon bringing the re&s;t on board,</HI> are &s;uppre&s;|&s;ed, it may be under&s;tood, that after Mr. Blodget's goods were on board without informing me thereof, he informed me that he had, and that was his de&s;ign in going Pur&s;er, to bring goods on board; and that Mr. Warren told him, that if he brought no more than his birth would hold, nobody would take notice of it: Which evidence, in that &s;en&s;e, is true, as far as he told me about a month before I re&s;umed the command; (and in the time that conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed, I had no certainty or even expectation of re&s;uming the command, as may be &s;een in the fir&s;t part of this memorial, by the date of the invitation of the officers, and the opinions of the Honorable Arthur Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and Commodore Gillon, about re&s;uming the command,) that Mr. Warren or the Navy-Board had given him leave to bring goods; but they having given me orders to the contrary, and I had &s;uch an high opinion of tho&s;e gentlemen's integrity, that I may have an&s;wered to not let me know it, as he had no writing from them to ju&s;tify what he &s;aid.&mdash;But to the contrary, in ad|mitting the interlined words to make park of the an&s;wer, and taking the &s;en&s;e Mr. Blodget wanted to be under&s;tood, to make it appear I gave a tacit a&s;&s;ent in &s;aying <HI>not to let me know it,</HI> after he had ju&s;t let me know it, could not be taken for an an&s;wer, but for an ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>The 8th que&s;tion and an&s;wer prove po&s;itively that I gave no leave whatever to bring goods on account of Mr. Lee and others.</P>
<P>The 9th que&s;tion's an&s;wer is remarkable, as it proves that the honorable Arthur Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> had to the amount of 500 Louis in goods on his own account, in the 550 Louis in goods Mr. Blodget
<PB N="43" REF="019056_0042_0FAA0CFE28B29058">
had in all on board, and in &s;aying it was by his advice that Mr. Lee inve&s;ted the&s;e 500 Louis in goods, &amp;c. but what can be meant by his <HI>privilege that would be no damage to any one?</HI> It cannot be the ab&s;urdity he pretends I told him, <HI>not to let me know it,</HI> for every one on board had the &s;ame right; but if he meant that privilege which he &s;aid Mr. Warren had given him, if true, it was really a privilege to him, as nobody el&s;e had the &s;ame, and I had even orders from the Navy-Board to the contrary: Therefore, as he &s;aid I gave him no leave to put Mr. Lee's and other goods on board, I was not guilty for his putting them in his privilege.</P>
<P>If the 10th que&s;tion means, as it may be under&s;tood, "Did five trunks contain all the goods you have mentioned." The an&s;wer, "Yes, and more," is po&s;itive; and if believed as well as that all the goods Mr. Blodget had belonging to him and to others amounted but to the &s;um of 550 louis, and that Mr. Lee had for his particular account for 500 louis in that &s;um&mdash;remains only for the account of Mr. Blodget and others for 50 Louis of goods, which is the 11th part of the total &s;um; and if all tho&s;e goods were about the &s;ame value for the &s;ame bulk, it may be computed that Mr. Blodget's and other goods, without tho&s;e of Mr. Lee, would not fill more than half a trunk; and that Mr. Blodget, being Pur&s;er, had opportunity and place to hide &s;uch &s;mall quantity of goods, without acquainting me with it.</P>
<P>The 12th que&s;tion, though there is a whole word and a letter omitted in its la&s;t &s;entence, &s;up|po&s;ing it to mean this, <HI>"Where was the &s;hip when the conver&s;ation took place between you and the Captain, re&s;pecting his telling you not to let him know that you had goods on board?"</HI> if &s;o, and the interlined words, <HI>on board &s;hip,</HI> are omitted, as they mu&s;t be, otherwi&s;e it would not be an an&s;wer to the que&s;tion; as it would be, Qu. <HI>Where was the &s;hip,?</HI> &amp;c. An&s;. <HI>On board the &s;hip,</HI> &amp;c. but if omitted, the an&s;wer is, <HI>In L'Orient, but before he came on board;</HI> which &s;ix words after the comma are relatives to <HI>In LOrient,</HI> as well as to the re&s;t of the an&s;wer; therefore it was previous to the time I went on board and re&s;umed my command (as the &s;hip had been there three months before) as I never went on &s;hore &s;ince; which part of the an&s;wer is true in that &s;en&s;e, that the &s;hip was in L'Orient; when long before I went on board, not knowing that I &s;hould ever re&s;ume my command, a tran&s;ient conver&s;ation took place between Mr. Blodget and me, about his telling me he had leave of the Navy-Board to bring, goods, and my an&s;wering, I had their order to the con|trary, and I never &s;aid otherwi&s;e. And what proves that I never varied from that principle, is that my fir&s;t queries, being on board the &s;hip, in the pre&s;ence of Mr. Blodget and all the officers, was, What goods were on board? upon which I was an&s;wered, that in the hold were cannons and barrels of powder, and between decks boxes of &s;mall-arms. As his telling me that <HI>he &s;uppo&s;ed Dr. Win&s;hip's chief rea&s;on for not being in my intere&s;t, was for fear Captain Landais would turn out the pro|perty he had on board.</HI> This part of his an&s;wer, if it was true, would prove him to be an informer and accu&s;er again&s;t a friend and countryman, to be added to his other unrighteou&s;ne&s;s; and proves that he an&s;wered &s;o merely to charge me, that he had acquainted me with Doctor Win&s;hip's having goods on board; as in his la&s;t an&s;wer of that day he &s;aid, he did not know whether I knew tho&s;e goods were on board.</P>
<P>The 17th and la&s;t que&s;tion of that day made by the Court, is contrived for the an&s;wer, as if the que&s;tioner had known the fal&s;ehood of the evidences given before to charge me, and had been willing to give opportunity to Mr. Blodget to deny his evidences about goods whatever, &s;o that the charges &s;hould &s;tand again&s;t me; for in the 12th an&s;wer, Mr. Blodget intimated that he had acquainted me that Dr. Win&s;hip had goods on board, therefore the que&s;tion cannot be for tho&s;e goods in particular; but if it is made in general for all the goods mentioned, the an&s;wer mu&s;t al&s;o be general, and mu&s;t be a denial that I knew of any goods being on board the &s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="019056_0043_0FAA0CFF6EB3D750">The Court being met again the following Monday, there were put to Mr. Blodget on the &s;ame &s;ubject the&s;e que&s;tions, viz.</P>

<P>As the&s;e two la&s;t an&s;wers contain nothing particular, and the re&s;t of Mr. Blodget's evidence related things which took no place in the articles made again&s;t me, I take no notice of them.</P>
<P>When Mr. Blodget had ended his evidence, I offered to cro&s;s-que&s;tion him upon the&s;e material points, viz. whether I had re&s;umed the command when he &s;aid he had &s;poken to me about goods, and whether I had then given him any tacit or explicit a&s;&s;ent or encouragement to have goods on board; and whether he had acquainted me that he or any body el&s;e had goods on board?&mdash;but the Court would not admit my que&s;tions, &s;aying, they were already made, and the an&s;wers to them given: I in&s;i&s;ted, and went to my writer (who I had never &s;u&s;pected before) which had wrote down the evidence, to prove by it that the an&s;wers were incon&s;i&s;tent with the que&s;tions, and not direct to the purpo&s;e; but one may ea&s;ier imagine than de&s;cribe my &s;urpri&s;e and indig|nation when I &s;aw the added interlined words, which gave to the an&s;wers the full extent that was wanted to make me appear guilty, and prevent my cro&s;s-que&s;tioning on tho&s;e point. Though the cheat was as obvious as gro&s;s and black, I could not mend it, as there was no by-&s;tander, or any body that I could apply to for redre&s;s or te&s;timony, and all I &s;aid availed nothing.</P>
<P>Seeing it was in vain for me to contend with tho&s;e of the Court which appeared to me to have led the others all along, and whom I had &s;trong &s;u&s;picion were the authors of the la&s;t deed; I undertook another way to bring Mr. Blodget to the time of the conver&s;ation mentioned. I pro|duced a letter which he had wrote to me at Paris, and made tho&s;e que&s;tions, viz.</P>

"How could you make &s;uch a propo&s;al, &s;oon after my arrival at L'Orient, to a man of virtue, to let you bring goods again&s;t his orders?"</P>
</SP>
<P>Captain Barry did not give me time to fini&s;h this que&s;tion, but &s;aid, <HI>"The Court prohibits Captain Landais from making any queries before his taking the command."</HI></P>
<P>I repre&s;ented to the Court, that the Court of Enquiry, who&s;e report had made the Court Mar|tial take place (both the warrants for the two courts prefixing the &s;ame time when to begin) had begun their enquiry from the time I arrived at L'Orient. Moreover, that the Court &s;itting had received from Mr. Blodget evidence again&s;t me, alluding to time previous to my going on board to re&s;ume my command, without mentioning how long before; and I &s;howed them the 12th an&s;wer, which contains it. But Captain Barry being again&s;t it, fearing, I &s;uppo&s;e, I &s;hould bring the truth to light that way, put it to the Court, who having deliberated on the matter, gave this an&s;wer:</P>
<P><HI>"The opinion of the Court being taken, whether Captain Landais &s;hould have liberty to a&s;k Mr. Blodget any que&s;tions previous to his taking the command at L'Orient, was determined in the negative; and Captain Landais not choo&s;ing to a&s;k any que&s;tions unle&s;s he could be indulged to que&s;tion Mr. Blodget relative to his conduct from the time he arrived at L'Orient, Mr. Blodget was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed."</HI></P>
<P>My writer, who wrote this, did not mention my repre&s;entation to the Court; neither that I told them &s;ince they prevented my cro&s;s-que&s;tioning Mr. Blodget from the time he had alluded to
<PB N="45" REF="019056_0044_0FAA0D0007575178">
in his evidence, I would not cro&s;s-que&s;tion any body el&s;e, being u&s;ele&s;s for me; being per&s;uaded, by the conduct of the Court, of their intention; and &s;eeing it was unnece&s;&s;ary to be there, I begg'd as a favour the Court would exempt me from attending there any longer, but they would not grant my reque&s;t.&mdash;I di&s;mi&s;s'd and paid my writer, having experienced too much his abilities.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t remind the reader, that though I had a&s;ked &s;everal times that the Court would order Lieutenant Elwood to give his evidence, he was the only one of the officers who did not; becau&s;e in the Court of Enquiry he had given in his evidence &s;everal depo&s;itions which would have proved fully again&s;t the articles the Court Martial de&s;igned to make again&s;t me; in particular he had &s;aid, that <HI>"I would not even permit him (Mr. Elwood) to have two hog&s;heads of wine for the ward-room &s;towed in the hold, for fear he would bring them to America; and that he had part bottled, and the re&s;t given away."</HI> Which would have proved that I was &s;o far from granting any private thing to be brought to America, that I oppo&s;ed thus the officers who I mu&s;t have ordered to receive Mr. Blod|get's goods on board, which is incompatible and incredible, as they would have depo&s;ed my order thereabouts.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, had the Court been willing to do their duty and ju&s;tice, it was in their power, as Mr. Blodget could not put tho&s;e goods on board without the Lieutenant on watch knowing it, and the marine officer on guard; and the Ma&s;ter could not &s;tow them without my leave, unle&s;s brib'd by Mr. Blodget: and if I had given leave, the Ma&s;ter would have entered it in his book, which was before the Court Martial all the time, where there was no &s;uch thing mentioned. Therefore the Court Martial wilfully or ignorantly not only cleared Mr. Blodget of his evident crime, but charged me with it in making the &s;econd article, though every thing concurred to evince my innocence.</P>
<P>This will be a precedent for any one that will have his Captain condemned again&s;t all proofs to the contrary, to &s;ay he has brought goods, and that the Captain told him <HI>"not to let him know it."</HI></P>
<P>I have thought proper to put in this place Mr. Blodget's evidence again&s;t me about goods all at length, and the Court's behaviour on that &s;ubject, as a &s;ingle in&s;tance of the Court's conduct du|ring my trial; and how the Court and Evidences believed me clear of any blame whatever, &s;ince they were compelled to contrive and &s;upport &s;uch things to have me condemned.</P>
<P>As to the 3d article;</P>
<P>Although I was very &s;edulous in all branches of my duty, it was in vain, as the pa&s;&s;engers, offi|cers and crew, after the latter were alienated from me by the influence of the former, and were all &s;o mutinous, &s;o much of the &s;ame mind, &s;o connected together, &s;o watchful to hide one another's crimes from me, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to know what plots they were about between decks, in the ward-room, or cock-pit, when I was on the quarter-deck or in the cabbin, nobody acquainting me thereof, as may be &s;een by the in&s;truments in writing given by the officers and pa&s;&s;engers, in the following evidences given in the Court of Enquiry, viz.</P>
<P>Mr. Buckly &s;aid, <HI>"The fir&s;t in&s;tance of any kind of di&s;turbance within my knowledge, was Mr. Degge's confinement, upon which a general di&s;&s;atisfaction aro&s;e again&s;t Captain Landais; and &s;ome of the men went &s;o far as to &s;ay in my hearing, that they would relea&s;e Mr. Degge."</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Buckly a&s;&s;ented to it, and very likely encouraged it from that time, &s;ince he never acquaint|ed me thereof, and effectually concerted, plotted, and &s;igned the in&s;idious piece with the other officers, given to the Court of Enquiry, for the relea&s;e of Mr. Degge, and taking the command of the Alliance from me, as was done.</P>
<P>Mr. Buckly further &s;aid, <HI>"Thomas Baily and James Pratt came to us in the ward-room, and a&s;ked our opinion about &s;peaking to Captain Landais upon altering the cour&s;e of the &s;hip, as &s;he was then &s;teering we&s;t half &s;outh."</HI></P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="019056_0045_0FAA0D00C271DAC0">Mr. Buckley, or any one of the ward-room officers, never acquainted me with this; which proves that the officers and crew concerted privately together their plot, &s;ince the officers put it in execution.</P>
<P>Parts of the evidences omitted to be wrote down by the Judge Advocate:</P>
<P>Mr. Larcher &s;aid, <HI>"I enquired of &s;ome of the people, whether they would rather go to York than Philadelphia? They an&s;wered, they had rather go to York, for there they &s;hould get exchanged without any great expence."</HI></P>
<P>I was never acquainted with this neither.</P>
<P>Mr. Elwood, Lieut. of Marines, &s;aid, <HI>"On the</HI> 10<HI>th of Augu&s;t one Pratt told me, if I delivered the keys of the arm-che&s;t to the Captain, they would have my life."</HI></P>
<P>This proves that officer, and perhaps all others, were parties, or in the plot of the crew; and I was never acquainted with this, neither with any thing whatever, relative to what preceded their open mutinies; therefore the officers were guilty for keeping &s;ecret tho&s;e things from me at lea&s;t, and very likely of planning and encouraging them.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the pa&s;&s;engers and officers depo&s;ed in the Court of Enquiry, and owned and gave in writing there, &s;igned by them (in the in&s;idious piece they made in order to ju&s;tify their clande&s;tine mutiny in taking the command during the night from me, and giving it to Lieutenant Degge,) that they con&s;ulted and agreed in the ward-room together upon tho&s;e facts; (for which crime, upon their own depo&s;ition, they were, by the 27th article of the regulation, proved guilty, with|out further trial, and condemnable to &s;uffer death); all which I was unacquainted with until after in was put in execution: Therefore it was impo&s;&s;ible to <HI>in&s;pect</HI> things utterly unknown to me, though &s;uch was <HI>the behaviour of the pa&s;&s;engers, officers and crew.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, being all in the plot again&s;t me alone, had they done tho&s;e things even in my pre|&s;ence, it was out of my power to prevent or puni&s;h them collectively or &s;eparately, and I could have done no more than I did, which was to prote&s;t again&s;t their deeds.</P>
<P><HI>I detected, and would have brought to puni&s;hment the offenders-on board,</HI> had the Navy Board, Court of Enquiry, or Court Martial been impartial, and willing to have ju&s;tice done; &s;ince on my arrival, by my official letter dated on board, Augu&s;t 15, 1780, to the Hon. Navy-Board at Bo&s;ton, <HI>and which was before the Court Martial,</HI> I acquainted &s;aid Navy-Board, <HI>"that I had two revolts of the crew, the fir&s;t on the</HI> 5<HI>th in&s;tant, in which I was not &s;upported in endeavoring to prevent it:"</HI>&mdash;By which the crew are not the only detected, but al&s;o the officers in general for not &s;upporting me, and the officers of marines in particular, as it was in them that the executive power laid in that ca&s;e, which I ordered in vain to be put in execution.&mdash;<HI>"The &s;econd on the</HI> 11<HI>th in&s;tant; in this the pa&s;&s;engers and officers had hands (as per log-book) for it was by them the cour&s;e was altered, contrary to my written orders; they advi&s;ed, reque&s;ted, and charged with a Lieutenant to bring the &s;hip here, which he has effected, though he was under arre&s;t."</HI> And I added, "<HI>You &s;ee, gentlemen, by the above pro|ceeding, it is to be &s;u&s;pected that a great many are concerned in this revolt, &s;ome out of policy, others by adventure intere&s;t, and all the guilty in the fir&s;t revolt, through fear that the occa&s;ion of it would be better &s;earched into at Philadelphia than it will be at Bo&s;ton. I was taken ill on the</HI> 11<HI>th in&s;tant. All that has been done &s;ince was without even advi&s;ing me thereof. Here are two ringleaders of the revolt on board, but I cannot have them &s;ecured till I have &s;ome body to obey me, and I &s;uppo&s;e the intention of every body is to exculpate them. All the officers refu&s;ed to receive my written orders; &s;ome &s;aid they received Mr. Degge's orders, who is the Lieutenant cho&s;en for the purpo&s;e. I am, &amp;c.</HI>"</P>
<P>By which extracts the pa&s;&s;engers and officers are impeached of having altered the cour&s;e, con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ary to my written orders; of having plotted together for taking the command from me and giving
<PB N="47" REF="019056_0046_0FAA0D018ED5CA60">
it to a Lieutenant who was under arre&s;t: all which was corroborated in the Court of Enquiry by their own evidence.&mdash;I likewi&s;e impeached the two ringleaders of the fir&s;t mutiny.</P>
<P>Moreover, I likewi&s;e impeached the officers al&s;o of di&s;obedience, in refu&s;ing to receive my written orders; therefore a detection, and a di&s;po&s;ition to bring the offenders to puni&s;hment, could not be more fully made appear than it was in that official letter which the Court Martial had before them.</P>
<P>Mr. Lynd, acting Lieutenant, in his evidence given in the Court-Martial &s;aid, (&s;peaking of L'Orient) <HI>"I heard Captain Jones was coming to America, and there was a letter &s;aid to be &s;ent on board, ordering the &s;hip to &s;ail; which letter was &s;aid to be from Congre&s;s, ordering the &s;hip to &s;ail for America. I heard Mr. Elwood &s;ay, that the &s;hip was ordered for Philadelphia."</HI></P>
<P>Therefore the officers knew Congre&s;s's order, even by the pack of letters that Capt. Jones had directed to be tran&s;mitted to the crew, which were delivered to me.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, about the fir&s;t mutiny, <HI>"I went and informed the Captain that the people wanted to &s;peak to him; he de&s;ired me to tell them to come five at a time, and he would &s;peak to them. I went up and told them, and they an&s;wered, that if they could not all go none would go. They then went on the quarter-deck, in order to make more &s;ail. I went to acquaint the Captain&mdash;he came upon the quarter-deck, fol|lowed by Mr. Pool, his Clerk, holding &s;everal papers. He called the marine officers&mdash;Capt. Parks was not on deck then&mdash;The Captain de&s;ired Mr. Elwood to call the Marines, and get them under arms&mdash;Mr. Elwood did not call the marines, that I know of&mdash;I don't recollect &s;eeing the marine officers open the arm-che&s;ts. After Captain Parks came upon deck, I did not &s;ee the marines under arms. The Quarterma&s;ter who &s;poke to the Captain, and told him to make &s;ail, was James Pratt; but I don't think the name he gave Captain Landais was his right name. The Captain and I went forward to let go the hallyards, and found they were rack'd aloft, and could not get the fore-top&s;ail down. The Captain went aft and &s;poke to Mr. Buckly, and begged that he would go and take a reef in the fore top&s;ail, and de&s;ired him to take the officers with him for that purpo&s;e. I went forward with him and Mr. Larcher; we found it impo&s;&s;ible to do it, as the people would not &s;uffer us. Mr. Buckly a&s;ked the Captain, in the name of God what he &s;hould do, when there was &s;o many again&s;t him?"</HI></P>
<P>By tho&s;e extracts of Mr. Lynd's evidence, though he tried to hide the truth all along, there is enough to prove that I gave proper orders nece&s;&s;ary to &s;top that mutiny, which were not executed by the officers, through their fear of the crew, or di&s;inclination to obey me. In the part of the evidence of Mr. Lynd given in the Court Martial, relating to the plots of the pa&s;&s;engers and offi|cers again&s;t, and their taking the command from me and giving it to Lieutenant Degge, the truth is &s;till more hidden than all the re&s;t; and he tried all he could to charge me, by mi&s;repre&s;enting things in order to exe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pate him&s;elf and others of their crimes, as might be expected of &s;uch guilty per&s;ons, after four months con&s;ultation together.&mdash;As there are &s;ome interlined words, I will write them as they are.</P>

</SP>
<P>In tho&s;e extracts of evidences all given, by men known to be my enemies, who&s;e lives were at &s;take, there is enough that appears to prove that I had done my duty. For Mr. Lynd acknow|ledged that I had given a written order to the Lieutenants, which was extant on the 10th Augu&s;t 1780&mdash;having never been recalled or altered by me, which was to have the &s;hip &s;teered we&s;t half &s;outh. The Honorable Arthur Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> acknowledged that on the &s;ame day two &s;ailors came in|to the cabbin to &s;peak to me, who mentioned all the &s;eamen's being without door, who wanted to &s;ee the Captain: I &s;aid I would not &s;peak to them, but &s;aying that they wi&s;hed to go to Bo&s;ton&mdash; I &s;aid my orders were for Philadelphia&mdash;The two &s;ailors then went out, and all the &s;eamen were much di&s;contended, uttering high words, to this effect, they would go them&s;elves. This was at 3 or 4 o'clock, and the Captain went to bed. Mr. Thomas Lee acknowledged, that on the &s;ame day Mr. Lynd came with Mr. Living&s;ton to me, that I was in my bed, reque&s;ted me to go and pacify the men, but I an&s;wered I had already given my orders, (which referred to my written or|der, as I had given no other.) Mr. Buckly and Mr. Lynd acknowledged, that on the &s;ame day the people de&s;ired them to alter the &s;hip's cour&s;e, that they an&s;wered, they would not, it &s;hould not be altered, and Mr. Buckly even drove them from the quarter-deck, <HI>(and it is not &s;aid, the people de&s;ired or attempted to have the cour&s;e altered after that.)</HI> Mr. Blodget acknowledged that on the &s;ame day he, and all the officers went into the cabbin; that I told them I had my orders to go to Philadelphia; Mr. Elwood a&s;ked me, if I would &s;how my orders; that I &s;aid I would not, for that was not cu&s;tomary&mdash;that there was a good deal pa&s;&s;ed that he could not recollect; that I &s;aid I was &s;ick, but I did not appear to be &s;o&mdash;that on the &s;ame day of the la&s;t revolt in the la&s;t di&s;tur|bance, Mr. Blodget and the officers read a letter, &s;igned by all the pa&s;&s;engers, advi&s;ing him and the officers to take the command from me and give it to &s;ome one el&s;e; but Mr. Lee, (who had &s;igned it fir&s;t) being a per&s;on of con&s;equence, was particularly attended to.</P>
<P>Therefore, by the&s;e extracts it its &s;ufficiently proved, (though the whole truth is not contained in them, as I have heretofore related in &s;peaking of that which happened on that day) that I &s;poke to the people and told them Congre&s;s's order was to carry the Alliance to Philadelphia, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d that I could &s;ay nothing &s;tronger than that to them to remind them of their duty; that I &s;aid the &s;ame to the officers, and confirmed my order to them, to have the cour&s;e &s;teered we&s;t half &s;outh, which was the direct cour&s;e for Philadelphia, being then at noon in 42&deg; 12 lat. north, and 62&deg; 51 we&s;t longitude, and con&s;equently that I did my duty as far as laid in my power, and proved a good example to the officers by my willingne&s;s to obey Congre&s;s's order. But that in the circum|&s;tances then had I been well, and done any thing more to prevent the combined mutiny of the officers pa&s;&s;engers and crew, it would have availed nothing, as the Honorable Arthur Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who was particularly attended to, during the plot again&s;t me held in the ward room, being in all appear|ance under fearful apprehen&s;ions of going directly to Philadelphia for &s;everal rea&s;ons, tho't Bo&s;ton was a &s;afer and ea&s;ier place to land his goods, and learn from his friends there what turn his af|fair with Silas Deane, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> had taken before Congre&s;s; and by the&s;e rea&s;ons, his animo&s;ity, and other views again&s;t me, he &s;igned fir&s;t, and after him all the pa&s;&s;engers, that in&s;idious piece again&s;t me, containing his undeniable advice to the officers to take the command from me and give it to &s;ome other per&s;on; and accordingly the officers, by another &s;imilar one, a&s;&s;ented to it;
<PB N="50" REF="019056_0049_0FAA0D049D3B6DD0">
and it was given in the middle of the night, (when the &s;hip was going under all &s;ails &s;at we&s;t half &s;outh, the wind being pretty fre&s;h, and the men very quiet) to Mr. Degge, who was under arre&s;t for having mutined again&s;t my order, who was tho't the mo&s;t &s;uitable, and he did not, nor any of the officers, offer to follow my example, in di&s;charging his duty by endeavouring to obey Con|gre&s;s's order, to carry the Alliance to Philadelphia, (though the heavy artillery and powder &s;he was loaded with was &s;u&s;pected to be for the &s;iege of New-York) but to the contrary, followed the Honorable Arthur Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> advice, altered her cour&s;e for Philadelphia, and carried her to Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>I believe I have &s;ufficiently demon&s;trated, that the Court Martial made without any foundation whatever, the 3d article again&s;t me, by charging me with the pa&s;&s;engers and officers obvious crimes.</P>
<P>By this precedent when the officers of a &s;hip will agree together to take the command of a &s;hip from their Captain, let him be never &s;o dutiful, they may do it, (though it is again&s;t all nau|tick laws to do it upon any pretence whatever) and break all &s;uperior orders, and the Captain mu&s;t be condemn'd for it.</P>
<P>As to the 4th Article.</P>
<P>Captain Barry, who &s;at pre&s;ident in the Court Martial to judge me, and who was already my &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the command of the Alliance, knew that I never oppo&s;ed his taking the command of the Alliance, nor interfered in it by words or actions whatever. He knew al&s;o the old table linen, which had been brought to me in one of my trunks at my lodging, I had offered to deliver him as &s;oon as he or the Navy Board would give me a general di&s;charge for the &s;tores and provi&s;ions that were in the cabbin, when I was forced out the Alliance by the Navy Board's order, becau&s;e part of tho&s;e had been plundered, as &s;oon as I was out of the &s;hip, by the neglect of the Navy Board or Captain Barry, in leaving no body to take care of them.</P>
<P>But though Captain Barry knew tho&s;e things, he never told it to the court, for fear I &s;hould be acquitted and re-e&s;tabli&s;hed again, and he debarred from the command of the frigate Alliance, by its being re&s;tored to me; or the court, convinced that I was guiltle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of the charges contained in the three fir&s;t articles they had made again&s;t me, thought proper to make the fourth &s;imilar to them.</P>
<P>It is added in the &s;ame article, that &s;aid court took into con&s;ideration that I was without credit or money, &amp;c. Indeed I was without money, as I had &s;pent &s;ince the year 1777, when I entered the United States &s;ervice, all my own money; and &s;ince my la&s;t arrival in Bo&s;ton I had &s;pent 100 Loui&s;dor, that I had brought for pocket money, to pay the Judge Advocate for giving me a copy of the evidences he had wrote in the Court of Enquiry&mdash;to pay two writers I had during &s;aid Court of Enquiry for taking down tho&s;e evidences, &amp;c. But I ought to have had credit as I was my&s;elf a creditor of large &s;ums to the United States, for which I had applied to the Admiralty Board, as there was one of tho&s;e &s;ums due to me in the year 1777, which was ordered by a third re&s;olve of Congre&s;s, in March, 1779, to be paid me; which &s;ums altogether, by a &s;eries of inju&s;|tice from all parts, though I have &s;ince repeated my application to Congre&s;s and their Mini&s;ter for that purpo&s;e, being out of their &s;ervice, to be paid, it had been all in vain.</P>
<P>In the &s;upplementary article to the four made by the Court Martial, it is &s;aid that I greatly &s;uffered from a mutinous di&s;po&s;ition in both pa&s;&s;engers and officers, and from a real mutiny in the crew of the &s;hip.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Since the Court Martial acknowledged that the pa&s;&s;engers and officers were both of a mutinous di&s;po&s;ition, they mu&s;t have had proof of it; and they could not have had proof of it, unle&s;s the pa&s;&s;engers and officers had actually mutinied again&s;t me; and really, though the Court
<PB N="51" REF="019056_0050_0FAA0D060ACA7380">
Martial tried with as much art to exculpate the pa&s;&s;engers and officers, as they did to make me appear guilty, their mutiny on the 10th Augu&s;t was more palpable, obvious, and undeniable to the Court (as there was my written order for the cour&s;e to be &s;teered we&s;t half &s;outh for Phila|delphia, extant, as well as the two in&s;idious pieces of writing, plotted, concerted, written &amp; &s;igned in the ward-room, one by all the pa&s;&s;engers, the other by all the officers, for taking the command of the frigate from me, which they effectually did, and broke Congre&s;s's order and mine, in alter|ing the cour&s;e, and bringing her to Bo&s;ton) than the other real mutiny of the crew on the 5th in&s;t. (as there was of this one no te&s;tified proof, &s;igned and acknowledged by the authors, as there was of the other) by the Court Martial.</P>
<P>Moreover, I &s;uffered from the pa&s;&s;engers and officers mutinous temper, becau&s;e they mutinied again&s;t my willingne&s;s to do my duty, in obeying Congre&s;s's order, and did quite the contrary.&mdash; Was ever his Excellency General Wa&s;hington condemned, tried, or even impeached, when the Penn&s;ylvania line mutinied and left the army? No; becau&s;e he could not prevent it.</P>
<P>I do not pretend to compare my abilities to tho&s;e of that Great General; but I may &s;ay, my intentions were ever as pure and as good as his Excellency's&mdash;and in that ca&s;e he had all the offi|cers, and three quarters of the army left, and willing to obey him; and I had not a man what|ever.</P>
<P N="2">2d. How could the Court Martial admit the evidence again&s;t me, of men who had evidently forfeited their life and could recover it but by charging me, and whom they acknowledged had made me &s;uffer from their mutinous di&s;po&s;ition when on board the &s;hip; could it be expected that tho&s;e mutinous di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons, after being kept four months together on board the &s;hip at Bo&s;ton, would own the truth, by which I mu&s;t be acquitted, and they condemn'd to death? it was more natural to think the contrary, that &s;ince tho&s;e per&s;ons being proved guilty of having made me &s;uffer from their mutinous di&s;po&s;ition when on board, would continue and increa&s;e that di&s;po|&s;ition in &s;ubverting the truth, in order to charge me and have me condemned to &s;atiate their ani|mo&s;ity, and prevent my evidence again&s;t them, and agree to &s;ay any thing to &s;ave their life. Tho&s;e things were palpable. But it appears that the court was all the time unanimou&s;ly deter|mined to have the innocent condemned, and the guilty, as much as they po&s;&s;ibly could, acquitted.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. How could the Court Martial make the 2d article again&s;t me upon the bare evidence of Mr. Blodget, (who was one of the principal among tho&s;e guilty per&s;ons by his intere&s;t and entice|ment to come to Bo&s;ton) again&s;t all the proofs given heretofore to the contrary.</P>
<P>But it appears that the Court Martial, having no foundation to make any article again&s;t me, was compelled to make one upon his apparent fal&s;ehood, in order to have me condemned.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. How could the Court Martial con&s;true the 3d article again&s;t me, wherein it is &s;aid, that I am guilty in not exerting my utmo&s;t abilities to in&s;pect the behaviour of the pa&s;&s;engers, officers and crew, &amp;c. though, be&s;ides all the proofs I have given to the contrary in the &s;upplementary article, they acknowledged that I greatly &s;uffered from a mutinous di&s;po&s;ition in both pa&s;&s;engers, officers, and from a real mutiny in the crew of &s;aid &s;hip, which demon&s;trates the impo&s;&s;ibility I was in, having every one on board again&s;t me, to in&s;pect the behaviour and plots of the pa&s;&s;engers, officers and crew, who being all of the &s;ame mind and di&s;po&s;ition, kept all &s;ecrets from me But the rea&s;on of the Court Martial's making the 3d article again&s;t me, may be a&s;cribed to the &s;ame motive which made them make the &s;econd.</P>
<P>The fourth article made again&s;t me by the Court Martial, though they knew that I never op|po&s;ed, in any degree, Captain Barry in his command of the Alliance, appears to have been made upon the &s;ame principle they had made the &s;econd and third&mdash;and the fir&s;t article proved my dutifulne&s;s and judgment in &s;ailing from L'Orient, as I knew Congre&s;s's orders to carry the fri|gate
<PB N="52" REF="019056_0051_0FAA0D06F4B65AB0">
directly to Philadelphia; and I had motives that urged me al&s;o to do it, and there was none for &s;taying, having wrote to his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, as &s;oon as I re&s;umed my command on board the Alliance at L'Orient, acquainting him with Congre&s;s's orders, who would give me none, and of cour&s;e was the only per&s;on faulty in that ca&s;e, as his &s;ilence was a tacit con&s;ent, &s;ince he gave me no order to the contrary.</P>
<P>It is perhaps proper, before I di&s;mi&s;s this &s;ubject, that I &s;hould remind the motives which influenced me to make this appeal to the impartial wi&s;dom of the public. Con&s;cious that I have faithfully di&s;charged my duty in all re&s;pects, through the numerous difficulties I underwent, with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;advantage, during my command in the American navy. I con&s;idered it as the la&s;t duty I owed to that &s;ervice, to expo&s;e to public view the artifices, malice and de&s;igns of my ene|mies, to &s;hew the &s;teps which led to my di&s;grace&mdash;the powerful combination formed to ruin me, and the characters mo&s;t active in this flagitious bu&s;ine&s;s; expo&s;ed not only to the jealou&s;y and prejudice of the officers of the navy in general, which has appeared from the cicum&s;tance of their petitioning for my removal two years before, and in particular of the principals of my judges in the Court Martial, who had be&s;ides &s;elf intere&s;t to de&s;troy me, in order to en&s;ure the command of the Alliance to them&s;elves; I had the Navy-Board at Bo&s;ton my declared foes, and a Judge Advocate &s;ub&s;ervient to their purpo&s;es. I have been, as &s;tated, the marked object of the venge|ance of his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and con&s;equently of his parti&s;ans, particularly his all-powerful friend the Honorable Robert Morris, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> on one &s;ide, and the Honorable Arthur Lee, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and party on the other.</P>
<P>Guiltle&s;s as I am, is it to be wondered that I have fallen a &s;acrifice to the malice of my ene|mies? and to &s;ave the guilty, that I have been condemned without proof, nay contrary to evi|dences offered in my ju&s;tification on my trial?&mdash;my character and reputation as far as their influ|ence extended, bla&s;ted&mdash;that my fortune has been ruined, by having large &s;ums due to me with|held from me, &s;ome &s;ince the year 1777, by the immen&s;e power and influence of the Honorable Robert Morris, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and the per&s;ons before named, to &s;atisfy their in&s;atiable malevolence.</P>
<P>I will now conclude this &s;econd part; but in ju&s;tice to the gentlemen of Bo&s;ton, cannot forbear to declare the graceful &s;en&s;e I entertain of the delicacy of their conduct during my trial: Though they were generally acquainted with what had taken place on board the frigate Alliance, and though Courts Martial were u&s;ually very crouded, yet they did not in any degree countenance this pro&s;ecution, even by their appearance in court, being confident that a &s;acrifice was about to take place, and therefore forbore to attend.</P>
