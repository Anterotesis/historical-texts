<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU whom the Lord hath reached unto in this the Day of his Love, and hath made known the way of Truth and Righteou&s;ne&s;s unto you, through the rai&s;ing up of that Holy living Witne&s;s of him&s;elf, that long lay hid and buried in you, and hath brought you to a &s;ecret feeling of &s;omething in you, that is worth the minding and regarding; and the Lord cau&s;ing this to Appear in the Day of your&s;eeking, as a Light, di&s;covering Darkne&s;s, and its Power, by which ye were formerly holden, and given you by his Spirit a &s;en&s;e and &s;ecret Hope, that in this Light, the way of Deliverance was to be at|tained unto; this Hope made you not a&s;hamed of the Light which before you hated, but you came to know and embrace it, even while others &s;till hated it, and you for its &s;ake; yet your Hearts being affected with the Hope that did appear therein, could not but joyn unto it, as to make publick Profe&s;&s;ion of

it for its own &s;ake; and for no other ends or de&s;igns, or intere&s;t at all, but with re&s;olution in that Light, to wait for the Salvation of God. Dear Friends, it is you aforemention|ed that both now, and for &s;ome Days and Weeks my Heart hath been deeply exerci&s;ed concerning, even Night and Day; and the aboundings of the Father's Love doth often overcome me, and draws me forth now to &s;ay and write the&s;e things unto you for your Admonition and E&s;tabli&s;hment; and indeed it is you who did thus rightly own the way of Truth, and knew your Believing to be the Gifts and Mercy of God to your Souls, that I do aim at; for tho&s;e that have taken up the Profe&s;&s;ion of the Precious Truth upon by-re|&s;pects and &s;ini&s;ter ends, and but for Rea&s;ons propounded in their Carnal Minds; tho' I do pity them, yet I have not much at this time to &s;ay to them but this, <HI>The Day &s;hall declare them, and their Garments &s;hall not hide them.</HI></P>
<P>But you, Oh my Friends! who had Fel|low&s;hip with us, in the deep Travels of our Beginnings, and did come to Truth the &s;ame way, and have known the Power and Virtue of it, many times overcoming you in your Inward man, which hath made you cry out, <HI>Lord, evermore give us of this Bread;</HI> and hath made you as a watered Garden: Oh Friends! how &s;hall I expre&s;s or &s;ignify unto you tho&s;e
<PB N="5" REF="016754_0004_0F9DF207B29D9C70">
Longings, tho&s;e ardent De&s;ires and earne&s;t Breathings of my Soul, that you, even you, might abide to the end of all Trials and Tri|bulations, Adver&s;ities, and might inherit that Crown of Immortality that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord, and might not by any means be bereft thereof; this is &s;ingly my Travel in bo|dy and Spirit, that you might be kept and pre&s;erved out of all the &s;ubtil Snares of the wicked One, which haunts for the Soul, even of tho&s;e that have Believed; and therefore in dear and tender Love, I have a few things to write unto you for the clearing of my Con|&s;cience, and di&s;charging my Duty in the &s;ight of the Lord; and the Lord give you all a tender and an under&s;tanding Heart, that both you and I may yet have cau&s;e Daily to Prai&s;e the Lord in the glorious Light of his Salvati|on, which he hath manife&s;ted among us by the Revealing his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to whom belongs <HI>Dominion, Honour and Glory for Ever, Amen.</HI></P>
<P>And fir&s;t, Dear Friends, it is in my Heart to put you in remembrance of that by which we were called and convinced, which as a Foundation Principle was laid in and among you, and it being unchangeable and unaltera|ble in it &s;elf, doth therefore admit of no alte|ration or change in tho&s;e that are rightly kept to it.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="016754_0005_0F9DF2087B83AFF0">It was a Light which aro&s;e in our Hearts, and &s;hined forth from God, the Father of Lights, carrying in its Appearance the Nature and Property of God, both in its Condemn|ing Evil, which the Enemy had Sown or Planted in us; and owning, allowing, and ju&s;tifying every thing that was good and ho|ne&s;t, ju&s;t and equal; even tho&s;e Thoughts in our Hearts which were of turning towards the Lord, and &s;eeking his Righteou&s;ne&s;s; the&s;e Thoughts were ju&s;tified and encouraged by the Light, and all the contrary di&s;covered and judged, as they were brought to it to be tryed. Now this Light did our Souls Rejoyce in, as they had good cau&s;e. tho' it took away our former Rejoycings; our Plea&s;ures in Va|nities and Iniquity died, our Glory in this World withered, our Friend&s;hip with the Sons of Men decayed, and we &s;tood in the Light and &s;aw all the&s;e things, and were not &s;orry at it, but waited daily to &s;ee the&s;e things more and more brought to pa&s;s; neither was there a permitting our Thoughts to go out, how we might prevent tho&s;e Damages, or repair the&s;e Lo&s;&s;es, but the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t was in|deed our Glorying or Rejoycing; and the Hope that was before us, did make us de&s;pi&s;e the Plea&s;ures, Trea&s;ures and Honours, Friend&s;hip and Delights of this World; and in tho&s;e Days you grew into a feeling of the Heavenly

Joy, where the Hundred-fold was witne&s;&s;ed in your Bo&s;oms, and the Zeal of the Lord was kindled by his own Spirit in you, again&s;t what&s;oever this Light of Je&s;us in the Con&s;ci|ence did witne&s;s again&s;t; and the Lord be|held your Integrity, and Ble&s;&s;ed you, and Multiplied you, and added to your Strength and Stature, and then did the Fruits of this Glorious Work abound among you, in three more general and &s;pecial Effects; by which ef|fects, or by their continuance among you, let all now come to &s;earch and try them&s;elves, that &s;o, Dear Friends, tho&s;e that have con|tinued Faithful in them all, may per&s;evere in like manner to the End: And tho&s;e, who upon true &s;earch do find, that they have fail|ed, and fallen &s;hort in all or any of them, may make ha&s;te to Repent, and to turn to that which was the Root of them all, that they may not be found as Fruitle&s;s and Withered Branches in the Day that cometh, le&s;t they be cut off, and utterly Con&s;umed, and blotted out from among the Living Branches of the Vine; for a Day cometh that Truth will look into the Fig-Tree for Fruit, and Leaves will not defend it from the Cur&s;e and Bla&s;ting.</P>
<P>The three e&s;pecial Fruits that did &s;pring forth from this Ble&s;&s;ed Root, and were and are to continue and increa&s;e in us and among us to the end, are the&s;e.</P>

And how comes an offence in this Na|ture to be light now, &s;eeing it was heavy in the beginning? Oh let not the greate&s;t Mer|cies of our God &s;o fill us, as to make us flight or forget the lea&s;t obedience, but rather let the continuance of his Mercy the more quick|en you up unto a Zeal for his Name and Truth in all things, to be found doing and &s;peaking according to the Rule of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, which ye learned in the Light, in the Day of your being low and little, and then nothing will ri&s;e up and be exalted in the Multitude of God's Mercies, but that Holy Birth which lives in Purity when it is at high|e&s;t;

and &s;o that Life of Righteou&s;ne&s;s will &s;hine forth more and more, which Glori|fies God and &s;eeks his Honour. Dear Friends, that ye might be kept &s;o unto the end, is the Breathing and Travel of my Soul: And that where this Neglect hath entered, and this afore&s;aid Corruption either in Speech or Ac|tion is to be found, that ye would receive the Word of Exhortation in Meekne&s;s and Fear, in which it was written unto you, and may re|deem the time, for the Days are and &s;hall be Evil, and none will hold the My&s;tery of the Faith (that &s;aves from falling in the Evil Day) but &s;uch as do keep the Pure and Undefiled Con&s;cience, which none can do but by per|&s;i&s;ting and continuing in the Daily Sanctifica|tion of the Spirit, and Belief and Obedience of the Truth.</P>
<P>A &s;econd Fruit that was brought forth from this good Root, was <HI>Unity</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> one towards another; which Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, is preciou&s;ly pre&s;erved in and among many to this very Day; who are &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the divers operations of Truth in them, to be all by one Spirit, that they are &s;till kept of one Heart and Mind, given up freely to &s;erve the Lord in &s;inglene&s;s of Heart in their Generati|on; and are in this good work as Strength|ners and Encouragers of one another; but notwith&s;tanding the Enemy hath been exceed|ing

bu&s;y to lay wa&s;te and de&s;troy this ble&s;&s;ed effect al&s;o, and that under divers Pretences, which the Lord &s;till di&s;covered by his own Light and Spirit in his People, who have &s;ing|ly waited upon him; but many have been his Wiles, &s;ometimes fitting and preparing Ve&s;&s;els to ri&s;e up in the Fle&s;hly and Sen&s;ual Wi&s;dom, and to Traduce and bring in Corrupt and Evil Doctrines, to try who were not &s;ound in the Faith, that they may draw them a&s;ide, into a Heat and Zeal for &s;omething which had not its Root in the Truth, and which they that abode in the Truth could not own, but Judge and Condemn in the Name of the Lord; which when &s;uch &s;aw, they took thereat oc|ca&s;ion of &s;triving to Propagate and Promote that which they &s;aw with&s;tood; &s;o having lo&s;t Subjection to the Spirit of Truth in them|&s;elves, which would have kept them in Uni|ty in the Body; and having al&s;o lo&s;t and laid by their &s;ubjection to them that were over them in the Lord, they then grew Stubborn and Wilful, and proceded in more Zeal for that which &s;tood in Oppo&s;ition to the Truth, than ever they did for the Truth it &s;elf; and the&s;e &s;ometimes have prevailed to the Subvert|ing whole Hou&s;holds, and have turned &s;eve|ral from the Faith and Simplicity that is in the Go&s;pel, who, as well as tho&s;e that Subvert|ed them, have lo&s;t the Fellow&s;hip of the

Saints, and the Savour of Life, either in them|&s;elves or others, and then the Enemy per&s;uad|ed them, all are Dead to the Life but them|&s;elves; and &s;o they grow to have a tickling Joy in what they do and &s;ay, in obedience to that perver&s;e and &s;ingular private Spirit, and &s;o grow up to &s;peak Evil of Dignities, and are unruly, and dare to &s;peak again&s;t Heaven, and them that Dwell and Inhabit in it, whom God makes to &s;hine as Stars in the Firmament of his Power; but alas for them! my Soul Pities them, when I &s;ee how they &s;port them|&s;elves with their own Deceivings; but the Day of the Lord is among his People, which hath and doth make them and their Spirit ma|nife&s;t, and their Fruits al&s;o have made them manife&s;t.</P>
<P>Another Way that the Enemy &s;eeks to break the Unity, and di&s;&s;olve the Bond of Amity, is, by Sowing a Seed of Jealou&s;y and Prejudice in the Hearts of &s;uch in whom he can get an Entrance; that &s;o they may cea&s;e from the true and unfeigned Love, and that upon a pretended Rea&s;on, becau&s;e of this or that, which is &s;uppo&s;ed or imagined, in the Evil Parts in them&s;elves, again&s;t others; giving heed to Evil Thoughts or Surmi&s;es, which break forth many times in Whi&s;perings and Tale-bearing; which tho' the thing &s;up|po&s;ed to be Evil, were really &s;o; yet this is
<PB N="14" REF="016754_0013_0F9DF2101132B5C0">
not to be allowed or given way to among you, but to u&s;e plainne&s;s one towards another, and &s;ingle-heartedne&s;s; and to &s;hut out the Evil One in this his &s;ubtil Appearance al&s;o. Oh Dear Friends! Remember how the Lord hath dealt with you, and deal you &s;o one by ano|ther; he hath not &s;ought Occa&s;ions again&s;t you, but hath long born and &s;uffered, and exerci&s;ed much Patience and Tenderne&s;s to|wards you; yet plainly Reproving the Evil in you, and not Trea&s;uring it up again&s;t you. On Friends! be like-minded one towards ano|ther, that the Enemy of your Peace and Con|cord may be defeated, and you pre&s;erved en|tire to one Head, even to Chri&s;t Je&s;us; and ye may be one, and the Name of the Lord may be one among you; and that which tends to the making cold your Love, may be Judged in all; and &s;o Brotherly Love will continue with you to the End.</P>
<P>Another way which the Enemy works to &s;catter, and to bring from this Unity, is, by leading &s;ome, who have Believed, into &s;ome Sin and Iniquity, which the Body (that are in the Truth) are con&s;trained to appear in Judgment again&s;t for the Truth's &s;ake; and yet notwith&s;tanding the Party &s;o Sinning, being above the witne&s;s in them&s;elves, which would bring them to own the Judgment of the Spirit of Chri&s;t in his Church, they
<PB N="15" REF="016754_0014_0F9DF210AB97D210">
exalt them&s;elves above the Judgment and &s;eek to gain to them &s;uch whom they can enter by their Words and Complaints, to take part with them again&s;t the Judgment, and tho&s;e that pa&s;&s;ed it. Such were tho&s;e who&s;e Words <HI>did Eat</HI> (the Apo&s;tle &s;aid) <HI>as a Canker,</HI> of whom the Believers in tho&s;e Days were to be aware; for commonly &s;uch as have gone from the Power, that &s;hould have kept them Clean and Upright, they will al&s;o turn again&s;t the Power in tho&s;e that abide in it, e&s;pecially if they be drawn forth to Reprove and Rebuke them: But let all &s;uch know, that's not the way to be Re|newed; and let all that take part with any that work Iniquity, know, that they do but defile their own Souls thereby, and do but rend them&s;elves from that Body which they cannot Pro&s;per out of. And therefore, Dear Friends, beware of joyning with that, in your &s;elves or in others, which the Power goeth again&s;t, let the Pretences be what they will; for that which doth Evil, will always be apte&s;t to &s;ow Evil Complainings of others; and &s;uch as are in the un&s;atisfied Murmuring again&s;t Judgement pa&s;&s;ed upon them, are much to be feared; for they thereby render them&s;elves to be the more Guilty, and yet the further from Repentance. But, Dear Friends, watch unto that which gives you a
<PB N="16" REF="016754_0015_0F9DF211875F44A0">
living feeling of the living Body, which is the Church, that in all things you may demean your &s;elves as true Members of it, &s;erving one another in Love, and &s;ubmit|ting your &s;elves one unto another for the Lord's &s;ake: That in all Plainne&s;s and Sin|glene&s;s, as becometh the Truth, you may &s;eek to pre&s;erve the Unity which the Enemy of Truth and Peace doth Envy; &s;o &s;hall ye continue to &s;trengthen one anothers hand in every good Work, and this &s;hall tend to the weakening of the Hands of your Enemies, who &s;eek to divide you, that they might Rule over you. Many other De&s;igns doth the wicked one try, daily to break and di|vide, more than can now be named or here in&s;erted; but they are all out of the Light, and if you be in it, you will &s;ee them, and that will pre&s;erve you; for it is one, and did make us one, and will keep us to be of one Heart and Mind to the End, if we abide in it.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Third good Effect which Truth did work in the beginning, in them who did truly receive it, was <HI>Zeal</HI> and <HI>Faithfulne&s;s</HI> to God, in bearing the Te&s;tamony to what was manife&s;t, tho' through great Sufferings; in which, as Friends abide in the Root, they do daily encrea&s;e in Power, to fulfil the &s;ame Te&s;timony: for the Mercy of the Lord doth engage them, and his An&s;wer of Peace in
<PB N="17" REF="016754_0016_0F9DF212304FF350">
the mid&s;t of their Tryals, doth Arm them, and Encourage them, and they do hold out to the end; and for &s;uch the Lord hath al|ways made a way, better than they could have made for them&s;elves. Yet the Enemy hath in this matter al&s;o been very bu&s;y, and hath prevailed with &s;ome under divers Con|&s;iderations, or rather Con&s;ultations, which he hath propounded unto them. But, Oh Friends, be ye all watchful, and take heed le&s;t any of the Te&s;tamonies of Truth be laid wa&s;te; for that which leads to be weary of bearing Witne&s;s to the Truth, and to lay it wa&s;te, the &s;ame will lay thee wa&s;te, and bring thee into &s;uch a State, as thou will want the Truth to bear witne&s;s for thee; and tho' it be hard for Fle&s;h and Blood (which hath no Kingdom but here) to fall into the hands of Unrea&s;onable Men, yet it is a more fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God; and therefore, let all Lukewarm ones, who are neither Hot nor Cold, be now awakened, and all that have gone Backwards be Warn|ed to <HI>return to their Fir&s;t-Love, el&s;e the Lord will come again&s;t them, and the Day ha&s;tens that will divide &s;uch their Portion among Hypocrites, except they Repent.</HI></P>
<P>But to touch at &s;ome of the Rea&s;ons or Arguments, which he that abode not in the
<PB N="18" REF="016754_0017_0F9DF212F5F51C40">
Truth him&s;elf, u&s;eth to draw others into this kind of Treacherous Back&s;liding</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> He Appears to &s;ome to Per&s;uade them, That their former Te&s;timony was born more from an imitation of others, than from a work of the Power of God in them|&s;elves; and that now, they not finding the Thing required of them, they may leave off their Te&s;timonies, or may do &s;uch things as they have denied formerly; this Snare doth the Enemy make u&s;e of in the&s;e Days. But mark who it is that he hath caught with it; none but &s;uch who &s;ometimes were low in their Minds, and dare not grieve the Spirit of God in them&s;elves, nor others, but for the Truth's &s;ake could give up all things, rather than their Te&s;timony; but in time growing Carele&s;s and Loo&s;e in Waiting, lo&s;t that &s;ub|ject State, and grew High and Exalted in their Minds above the Cro&s;s that &s;hould have Crucified the betraying Wi&s;dom; and &s;o having lo&s;t the true Exerci&s;e of the Power, and the feeling of the Excellency and Worth of the Truth, they knew not the Requirings of the Lord; and the Earthly Mind got up, that placed a greater E&s;teem upon Earthly Things, than upon Things that are Eternal; and &s;o Things that once thou offered&s;t up to God, thou take&s;t again into thine own Hand,

and &s;o Robbe&s;t the Lord, and growe&s;t Care|ful about Outward Things, as other <HI>Gentiles</HI> are; and to cover thy Shame therein, the Enemy then Tempts thee to bely the Power that once wrought in thy Heart, and made thee afraid to Act again&s;t this Light, or to deny the Te&s;timony of God in &s;uch things as was manife&s;t, and then &s;ay'&s;t, thou did&s;t it by imitation; but thou &s;halt know thy Covering is too Narrow in the Day that ha&s;teth upon thee.</P>
<P>Another Temptation that the Enemy pre|&s;enteth, is, That tho' thou art Convinced what to do, or what thou &s;houlde&s;t deny, yet the Tryals are &s;o hard and &s;o many, and Per&s;ecutors wax wor&s;e and wor&s;e, &s;o that thou &s;halt not hold out to the End; and where he can get Entrance with this Bait, he pre&s;ently cau&s;eth an Evil Heart of Unbelief and Doubting to ari&s;e, which takes away even the Strength which the Lord did give, and &s;o Feeblene&s;s doth enter the Mind, and a Spirit of Bondageleads thee to Fear again; and then comes the Di&s;pute in thy Heart, whe|ther thou &s;halt Stand with the Power of God, in the Obedience, or whether thou &s;halt Fall under that Power that ari&s;eth again&s;t God, and his Truth and People?

<P>I Have &s;omething farther in my Heart to communicate unto you, in dear and ten|der Love, and in de&s;ire of your Pre&s;ervation out of the Snare of your Adver&s;ary; and that is. To Exhort you all to dwell in the pure Judgment of the Truth, which is a Defence upon your Glory; and let none be|reave you of this, under any pretence what|&s;oever; but as you come to a true feeling of the Life in your &s;elves, to which alone the certain Judgment appertaineth, &s;o let this Life have freedom, and &s;top it not from the Judging all that which is at Enmity with the Life, and tends to the hurting of the true Plant of God; for I have &s;een a Harm hath come to many who have parted with their Judgment, and &s;o have become Unarmed, and the Enemy hath prevailed upon them, (under a pretended Tenderne&s;s) to permit or &s;uffer &s;uch things as were hurtful to them&s;elves and
<PB N="33" REF="016754_0032_0F9DF222AE279128">
others; and though the Lord hath given them Judgment and di&s;cerning in the Mat|ter, yet were bereaved of that Gift, and &s;o by little and little became Beguiled.</P>
<P>Oh dear Friends! Con&s;ider the&s;e Days are Perilous Times, and it is needful for every one, to watch in that &s;ame Eternal Light to which you were fir&s;t turned, that by his Righteous Judgment ye may be Per&s;erved from every thing in your &s;elves that appears contrary to that precious Life of which you have ta&s;ted: And when you have &s;o done, then to take heed, that the Enemy do not do that by an In&s;trument which (through your watchfulne&s;s in the Light) he could not do without; and all beware of that affected Tenderne&s;s that cries out, <HI>Be tender to all, and Pray for all, and mind the Good in all, and Love all, and Judge none, but leave Judg|ment to God,</HI> &amp;c. I &s;ay, Heed not the plau&s;i|ble words of that Spirit which being Guilty, to &s;ave its own Head from a Stroke, would bereave you of you&punc; Judgment, which God hath given you; and is in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> truly his Judg|ment, and is to be Admini&s;tred in his Wi&s;|dom and Power, for the clean&s;ing and keep|ing clean his Sanctuary; for &s;uch as have no Judgment in their goings, are they that know not the true way of Peace, but make
<PB N="34" REF="016754_0033_0F9DF22372473F10">
them crooked Paths, <HI>He that goeth in them &s;hall not know Peace,</HI> I&s;ai. lix. 8.</P>
<P>But &s;ome may &s;ay, <HI>Was not Chri&s;t Meek and Lowly? and ought not all to be like unto him?</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, my Friends; but there is a differ|ence between the Seed's Suffering, and its Reigning, and there are times for them both: And when it doth plea&s;e God to per|mit the Hour and Power of Darkne&s;s in the open Per&s;ecutors, to exalt it &s;elf again&s;t his Seed and People, by Per&s;ecution and &s;uch like; they are led by his Spirit to appear in Meekne&s;s and Quietne&s;s, as a Sheep before the Shearer. But what is this to &s;uffering Bad and Perver&s;e Spirits, that appear under Pretence of the Truth, and yet are out of the Truth, and Enemies to its Pro&s;perity, &s;triving to exalt and &s;et up another thing in&s;tead of the Truth? Such as the&s;e the Lord doth not require you to u&s;e only Patience and Meekne&s;s towards; but if that will not Reclaim them, they mu&s;t know the Judgment of the Truth, and you in it mu&s;t &s;tand over them; for in this ca&s;e the Day of the Exaltation of Chri&s;t is come, and God is crowning Truth with Dominion over every Fal&s;e Spirits and Corrupt Practice thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="016754_0034_0F9DF2246FA15048">And therefore, dear Friends, Eye the Lord in his goings forth, and as you feel his Life in you to witne&s;s again&s;t any Evil and Corrupt Thing or Practice, u&s;e Plain|ne&s;s, and keep Sincerity, and turn not Judg|ment backwards; for that which is unwil|ling to be Judged, and cries out, <HI>Judge none, leave all to God,</HI> &amp;c. The &s;ame will take up|on it both to Judge and Rule, but not in the Wi&s;dom of God; and tho&s;e that cry out &s;o much for Tenderne&s;s, and again&s;t Truth's Judgment, the &s;ame are mo&s;t dan|gerous to be drawn out from the Patient Suffering in the Spirit of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, when they ought to appear in the mo&s;t Meekne&s;s, and to appear Rough and Wrathful in the Striving and Fighting Nature, and are mo&s;t apt to be tempted into a Spirit of Revenge, as hath been &s;een by &s;ad Experience, for they that lo&s;e the Exerci&s;e of that by which all &s;hould keep Dominion over Deceit, they lo&s;e that Strength by which they &s;hould be enabled to &s;uffer all things for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>So, Dear Friends, in that which keeps out the De&s;iler and the Betrayer, all wait upon the Lord, that you may have your Armour on, and be Fortified with the Strength, with the Might, and with the Judgments of God,

and keep that under in every place, which under Pretence of Tenderne&s;s and Forbear|ance would make Void the Te&s;timony of Truth, or make the Offence of the Cro&s;s to cea&s;e in any thing wherein you have been In&s;tructed from the Beginning, that the Lord may behold and &s;ee Judgment E&s;tabli&s;h|ed, and be Plea&s;ed, <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> lix. <HI>The Lord took|ed, and there was no Judgmont, and it di&s;|plea&s;ed him;</HI> for thereby Deceit got up, with which it is to be kept down.</P>
<P>So the Lord God of Power and Wi&s;dom pre&s;erve you Faithful, and fitted for every good Word and Work; the Strong to watch over the Weak in Singlene&s;s; and the Weak to be &s;ubject to the Strong in the Lord, that &s;o the pure Plant of Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Truth may grow in and among you all, to his Prai&s;e that hath called you; To whom be Glory and Honour for ever, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
