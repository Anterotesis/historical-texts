<BIBL>Jer. xxviii 16.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>&mdash;This year thou &s;halt die.&mdash;</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHAT is &s;aid of general rules may be applied to general maxims; for hard|ly any one of either holds true in every ca&s;e. What maxims more general than the&s;e three <HI>&mdash;All mu&s;t die&mdash; None knoweth the time of his death&mdash;Ignorance of the time is better than the knowledge of it</HI>? Yet each of the&s;e hath many exceptions. The text is an exception to the &s;econd maxim, and po&s;&s;ibly to the third; other texts there are which afford exceptions to the fir&s;t, What I intend to do is, To di&s;|cour&s;e on tho&s;e exceptions; and then to addre&s;s you in &s;uch a manner as may be &s;uitable to the time and the text.</P>
<P N="1">I. The fir&s;t maxim a&s;&s;erts that <HI>all mu&s;t die,</HI> &mdash;This is a decree of heaven, and is expre&s;&s;ed in general terms throughout the Bible. The rea&s;on of the decree comports with the gene|rality of its terms, for <HI>all have &s;inned,</HI> Rom. v. 12; neverthele&s;s the execution thereof will not &s;eem adequate to either. Enoch and Elijah &s;inned but died not, Heb. xi. 5.2 King. ii 11.
<PB N="4" REF="011642_0003_0F879E6970CD39A0">
The &s;aints on Earth at the coming of Chri&s;t will not be &s;inle&s;s, yet none of them &s;hall die; and they perhaps may amount to many thou|&s;ands or millions. 1 Cor. xv. 51. But if the&s;e exemptions of &s;inners from death be real, how can death be the <HI>wages of &s;in</HI>? how will the veracity of God appear in &s;aying, <HI>the &s;oul that &s;inneth &s;hall die</HI>? I an&s;wer, Chri&s;t died for all the &s;inners who die not. And his death was &s;ub&s;tituted in the room of theirs, and con&s;ider|ed of God and of his law as their own. But did not Chri&s;t die for others, even for all the elect? Why then are not all exempted from dying? I an&s;wer, It is not becau&s;e the death of Chri&s;t was le&s;s proxical or le&s;s &s;atisfactory in the ca&s;e of the one party than of the other; but for &s;ome good rea&s;ons or de&s;igns unknown to us. The death of &s;aints however differs not much from athanacy. It is no penal evil. A &s;ting it has not. <HI>Falling a&s;leep</HI> is a ju&s;t repre&s;entation of it. Some have de&s;ired it as an u&s;her to glory, and lamented a recovery out of fits which, in their acce&s;s, they took to be death it&s;elf. I have met with an in&s;tance of this la&s;t, in my own hou&s;e the thirteenth of Augu&s;t pa&s;t; and that from a per&s;on who was very near and dear to me; which helped me much in the mid&s;t of my &s;orrows.</P>
<P N="2">II. The &s;econd maxim is <HI>That no man know|eth the time of his death.</HI> This, though it be not &s;criptural, obtains in the world as an uni|ver&s;al truth. But it has exceptions. And I intend under this head to &s;hew&mdash;That &s;ome
<PB N="5" REF="011642_0004_0F879E6A16958650">
have known the times of their death; and to mention the ways and means whereby they obtained that knowledge.</P>
<P N="1">1. I am to &s;hew that &s;ome have certainly known the time of their death. And what has been may be again. Hananiah knew the year in which he &s;hould die, as appears by the text. Hezekiah mu&s;t have known as much. I&s;aiah xxxviii. 19. Saul knew the day of his death. 1 Sam. xxviii. 19. Dives, the night in which his Soul &s;hould be required of him. Luke xii. 20. Profane hi&s;tory abounds with names of per&s;ons who have foretold, &s;ome the year, &s;ome the month, and &s;ome the day of their de|cea&s;e; &s;uch as Ju&s;tin Martyr, Cyprian, and others among the ancients. Hale, U&s;her, Jewell, Tyro and Peden, among the moderns. To which I could add &s;ome in&s;tances, which have fallen under my own ob&s;ervation. All the&s;e died at the times predicted, and therefore mu&s;t have known the times. Come we</P>
<P N="2">2. To &s;peak of the ways and means by which men have attained to that knowledge. Hananiah and Hezekiah were informed of the fatal time by prophets. Saul by a &s;peaking apparation. Tyro by an audible voice which &s;aid 'Thou &s;halt not pa&s;s the thirty fourth year of thy age,' Polycarp, in a vi&s;ion, &s;aw his martyrdom and the manner of it three days before it came. Cyprian and U&s;her di&s;|covered the preci&s;e time of their death, by dreams. Hale, Jewell, and Peden by an <HI>un|accountable</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="011642_0005_0F879E6D6FC6A6E0">
premonition or boding that ro&s;e in their minds, by which the fir&s;t informed his acquaintance 'that on &s;uch a day or the &s;ame day month he &s;hould be no more', which la&s;t brought the event to pa&s;s. The next told &s;everal 'that within forty eight hours he &s;hould be in eternity'. The other &s;aid 'this day is to be my la&s;t'; in all which ca&s;es events proved predictions. A gentlewoman in town had &s;omething of this premonitive or forebod|ing impre&s;&s;ion on her mind for a con&s;iderable time, and had been heard to &s;ay 'that &s;he &s;hould die with her eighth child'; and in her eighth pregnancy &s;he died Augu&s;t 16, 1769. I my&s;elf know a man who, on the ninth day of March, in the year 1755, was &s;eized with a per&s;ua&s;ion, <HI>That at the end of full fifteen years, from that time, he &s;hould be dead.</HI> The impre&s;&s;ion was &s;udden and &s;trong; &s;o &s;trong as not to leave a doubt re&s;pecting the i&s;&s;ue, and has continued the &s;ame to this day. About four years after he told a friend of it; that friend endeavouring to rally him out of the notion made the thing known abroad, which was pre&s;ently &s;poken of in various ways. But the above is the &s;tate of the ca&s;e. Whether a pre|monition or a deception time will &s;how, and that time is at hand : if the fir&s;t, the thing will claim no prai&s;e becau&s;e involuntary; if the la&s;t, others have been deceived the &s;ame way without blame, and that for the &s;ame rea&s;on.</P>
<P N="3">III. The other maxim is, <HI>That perfect igno|rance of the time of death is better than a know|ledge
<PB N="7" REF="011642_0006_0F879E6F009E62E0">
of it.</HI> And I believe this, becau&s;e God leaves mo&s;t men in the dark about the matter. Whatever is, is be&s;t. But as it is certain that God hath &s;hewn to &s;ome their times of di&s;&s;o|lution, We mu&s;t for the &s;ame rea&s;on believe the oppo&s;ite of the above maxim in their ca&s;es; otherwi&s;e neither God's prophets nor God's providence would have di&s;clo&s;ed the &s;ecret. The de&s;igns of providence in concealing from mo&s;t men the number of their days may be &s;een in Drelincourt on death. But his de&s;igns in making known to &s;ome the periods of their exi&s;tence I can only gue&s;s at.</P>
<P N="1">1. When God makes the di&s;covery to a wicked man it may be to ha&s;ten his amendment. The thing has a peculiar aptitude to an&s;wer the end; el&s;e why does a phy&s;ician inform a wicked patient, or a judge inform a criminal that he has but &s;o many hours to live? Aha|ziah, Hananiah, and Saul were wicked men; and who knows but God meant to pluck the&s;e &s;ons of Abraham as brands out of the burning by the di&s;coveries he made touching the near|ne&s;s of their deaths. Certain it is that Saul fell to the ground, fa&s;ted, and &s;orrowed much when he heard the fatal &s;entence <HI>to morrow &s;halt thou be among the dead</HI>! Certain al&s;o, that the &s;entence of a judge or a phy&s;ician hath made wretches think &s;eriou&s;ly and think &s;peedily of a preparation for death who could not be mov|ed thereto by any other means.</P>
<P N="2">2. When God &s;hows a good man the time of his death it may be, either for a brighter
<PB N="8" REF="011642_0007_0F879E7037F21908">
di&s;play of his piety. How gloriou&s;ly pious did the King of I&s;rael appear when he was told that he &s;hould die and not live. I&s;aiah xxxviii. Or, for exciting him to greater diligence. Peter confe&s;&s;es that it had this effect upon him. 2. Pet, I. 14. Or el&s;e to give him an oppor|tunity of knowing his &s;tate. Bel&s;hazzer knew not what a wretch he was till he &s;aw on the wall how &s;oon he &s;hould die, Dan. v. But when Paul knew that the time of his departure was at hand he felt more comfortable and happy than before. 2 Tim. iv. 8. But whether the above be the rea&s;ons why God doth di&s;cover the &s;ecret to &s;ome few may be doubted; yet that he hath made &s;uch di&s;coveries, and that to both wicked and good men, cannot be doubted at all.</P>
<P N="4">IV. I proceed to the &s;econd thing I promi&s;|ed viz. to addre&s;s you in a manner that may &s;uit the text, and the time; and that will, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, be of benefit to each of you.</P>
<P N="1">I. The time, you know, is the fir&s;t day of the new year, and that which connects it with the old; on which account it, like Janus, ca&s;ts a double a&s;pect, the one on the year pa&s;t; and the other on the year begun. It will be &s;uitable to the time therefore to &s;ay &s;omething of it both in its retro&s;pection, and pro&s;pect. If, with the day, we look back to the year it pu&s;hes from us we &s;hall &s;ee cau&s;e for thank&s;|giving; and &s;orrow; thank&s;giving for a year's
<PB N="9" REF="011642_0008_0F879E70EE2E9608">
bounties; and &s;orrow for a year's &s;ins. Every day and every night of the la&s;t year yielded us &s;ome favours. God's mercy was new every morning; and his faithfulne&s;s repeated every night. He gave us food and raiment, and health, and liberty. He gave us his &s;abbaths, his go&s;pel, and his means of grace. He gave us hope, and &s;upported it by tokens of his love. He hath borne with us and &s;pared us a year longer. He hath crowned the year with good|ne&s;s. Thanks therefore be to his holy name. But the&s;e thanks are to be mingled with &s;or|rows. We have a year's &s;ins to bewail. How many the&s;e have been God only knows; but we ea&s;ily know the number of them to have been great. Not a day nor a night pa&s;&s;ed with|out producing &s;ome wants of conformity to, or or tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of the law and go&s;pel. O, Lord we look back with &s;hame from the begin|ning of this year; we judge and condemn our|&s;elves, and mo&s;t humbly a&s;k forgivene&s;s of the pa&s;t year's &s;ins! But if with the day, we look forward to the year commenced we have a pro&s;|pect big with in&s;tructions. It meets us with calls to re&s;olve, to pray and to &s;trive. To re|&s;olve that in the name and &s;trength of God we will &s;pend this year better than the pa&s;t. To pray that God will be bountiful and kind to us as he hath been the la&s;t year, and to &s;trive to offend him le&s;s, to plea&s;e him better, and to love him more. Such re&s;olutions, prayers, and &s;trivings &s;uit the time well, but &s;uit our own character and intere&s;t much better.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="10" REF="011642_0009_0F879E7196A77FE0">2. Having &s;aid &s;o much to the time I will add &s;omewat that may be &s;uitable to the pe|culiar nature of the text. It is a very alarm|ing one to wicked men; but plea&s;ing, highly plea&s;ing to the righteous. <HI>This year thou &s;halt die</HI>! What, die? and that, this year? Alarming in|deed! Every &s;yllable &s;ounds like the ticking of a death-watch! Ob&s;erve! Death is in the text! And a &s;pecification of <HI>this year</HI> for the time of death to &s;ome one or other! But who is that one? I an&s;wer, <HI>po&s;&s;ibly</HI> every one here&mdash; <HI>probably</HI> many a one&mdash;and <HI>certainly</HI> &s;ome one or other! It is po&s;&s;ible that every one of us may be dead before the end of this year; for the world is grown old. And where is the man or the angel that will in&s;ure its continuance for a month, a week, or a day longer? Or if the end of all things be not at hand who can &s;ay that neither the &s;word, nor famine, nor pe&s;ti|lence, nor Indians, nor earthquake &s;hall put an end to us all in three hundred and &s;ixty five days? May I not repeat my text therefore to expre&s;s a po&s;&s;ibility of what may befall <HI>every one</HI> of us this year? But po&s;&s;ibilities are light things. Therefore I add, that the text will <HI>probably</HI> be verified this year in the ca&s;e of <HI>many a one</HI> here. This congregation con&s;i&s;ts now of an hundred and forty nine communicants; and as many hearers be&s;ides as will augment the number to about four hundred. If we &s;uppo&s;e that five in a hundred will die (and the bills of mortality for years pa&s;t ju&s;tify the &s;uppo&s;ition) a &s;core will never &s;ee another new-year's day. Shall I then repeat the text to expre&s;s with probality that
<PB N="11" REF="011642_0010_0F879E726008C670">
this year twenty of us &s;hall die? and &s;hall not this affect us? I am &s;ure the thought affects me; for &s;ome of the twenty may be the be&s;t friends which the &s;ociety has! But I may pro|ceed to <HI>certainty</HI> in applying the text. It is <HI>certain,</HI> morally <HI>certain</HI> that <HI>&s;ome one</HI> of us will die this year. To &s;uppo&s;e the contrary were to &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a thing as never happened in any other &s;ociety of equal number. There &s;tands among you one who firmly believes that he is the man. But let not that draw the at|tention of any other from him&s;elf, for <HI>probably</HI> &s;everal more will never &s;ee the end of this year.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t now &s;aid 'that my text is a word of fear to a wicked man, but a word of con&s;o|lation to the righteous'. And of one or the other character are all pre&s;ent. Shall I &s;uppo&s;e here be &s;ome of both, and as &s;uch addre&s;s them on the &s;ubject of dying this year?</P>
<P N="1">I. Is there a gracele&s;s per&s;on in the place, whether young or old or of middle age?&mdash; If young, and entering on this new year in a condition unfit for death, mu&s;t I in thy hearing repeat a text which declares that <HI>this year thou &s;halt die?</HI> Can&s;t thou hear it without emo|tion; or be a&s;&s;ured that thou art not the ob|ject of the prediction? I trow not. Wilt thou not then begin to prepare for dying in the begin|ning of this year of death? Wilt thou go on as heretofore? Forgetting thy creator? With|holding thy neck from his yoke? Avoiding a profe&s;&s;ion of his religion? Acting the <HI>child of
<PB N="12" REF="011642_0011_0F879E732F950F90">
di&s;obedience</HI> towards the duties, the ordinances and calls thereof? Pur&s;uing plea&s;ure and gid|dine&s;s? Putting off the care of the &s;oul with re|ference to eternity, and &s;o die? God forbid! Thou comely youth! thou fair dam&s;el it mu&s;t not be! The thought will di&s;tre&s;s thy friends and di&s;tract thy parents! Alas! alas! that &s;o much excellency &s;hould peri&s;h this year! that &s;o much comeline&s;s and beauty &s;hould this year again go to &s;in and then to hell? I pray you, my young hearers, I pray you in Chri&s;t's &s;tead that ye be reconciled to God this year. If ye &s;eek him early ye &s;hall find him. Prov. viii. 17.&mdash;If there be a gracele&s;s man or a gracele&s;s woman in the a&s;&s;embly, and I &s;hould addre&s;s him in the language of the text, how will he bear it, or how gain&s;ay it, <HI>This year thou &s;halt die</HI>! I hope thou wilt not bear &s;o awful a denunciation as thou woulde&s;t a light thing? nor defer a preparation for the event as if &s;ure that thou art not the object of the prophecy! God forbid! For if thou die this year, and art not born again this year, thou wilt this year be in torments! O man! let this beginning of the year be the be|ginning of the newne&s;s of life with thee, and the end of a gracele&s;s and unconverted &s;tate! To be men grown and women grown and that in a &s;tate of guilt and irreligion is to have run too great ri&s;ques already. Dread to do &s;o this year al&s;o; for it may be the la&s;t, and you ru|ined forever!&mdash;Or is there an old &s;inner in this a&s;&s;embly? An ancient man or an an|cient woman who hath borne the heat and burden of the day in labouring for all things
<PB N="13" REF="011642_0012_0F879E73DC768790">
except the <HI>one thing needful?</HI> If there be, let him hear the word of the Lord, <HI>this year thou &s;halt die</HI>! Surely 'tis the eleventh hour with thee! thy gray hairs, thy feeble and tottering frame and thy broken voice declare it. And wilt thou &s;tand idle in the market place till that hour expire with the re&s;t? God forbid. I have &s;omewhere read this epitaph, HERE LIES AN OLD MAN AGED THREE YEARS; for three years before his death he had been converted. But if thou die this year, and art not convert|ed what &s;hall we write on thy tomb? Shall we write, 'Here is buried an ancient man or an ancient woman aged nothing? Who had not as much as a being in Chri&s;t before his gray hairs went down to the grave? Forbid it, merciful God! Ancient of days, forbid it!</P>
<P N="2">2. I &s;hift the &s;cene; for I &s;ee or believe I &s;ee in the a&s;&s;embly &s;ome youth, &s;ome men and &s;ome women, &s;ome ancients and matrons who are ripe for glory. I rejoice over you; for to each of you a repetition of the text will be the voice of a charmer and a prophecy of &s;mooth things! This year each may be in heaven! How is it proved? Thus&mdash;<HI>This year thou &s;halt die!</HI> My good child! If thou die this year thou &s;halt be with him that loveth little children and that was once called, <HI>the child Je&s;us</HI>!
