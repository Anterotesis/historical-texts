<P>IF it was the arduous ta&s;k of the fir&s;t emi|grants to America, to fell the fore&s;t, plough the field, and defend it from &s;avage bea&s;ts, and more &s;avage men; if it was the labour of their children, to make the wilderne&s;s "blo&s;|&s;om like the ro&s;e," guard their young &s;et|tlements from inva&s;ion, and their chartered rights from aggre&s;&s;ion; if it was the lot of the elders of our day to re&s;i&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ion of the mother country, &s;eparate America from the Briti&s;h empire, give her independence and a con&s;titution of government, CAN IT BE DOUBTED, that it falls to our lot to &s;ettle the admini&s;tration of this government, &s;ub&s;tan|tiate
<PB N="6" REF="035024_0004_0FFFEA9D14D79240">
its powers, and give to our country a national CHARACTER.</P>
<P>THE habits and manners of a young coun|try become a&s;&s;imilated and familiarized by time and intercour&s;e. The nece&s;&s;ary connex|ion for defence, commerce, and government, impart to a nation the virtues or vices of em|inent individuals; and time, which ripens all things, di&s;&s;eminates the prevailing "manners as they ri&s;e," and forms the appropriate na|tional character. That mu&s;t be as immature manhood in a nation as in an individual, which on a &s;udden a&s;&s;umes a national characteri&s;tic, unoriginated in experience. No extent of genius, no favourable propen&s;ities, or digni|fied &s;en&s;ations, &s;o happily &s;ub&s;erve the great purpo&s;es of life to the individual or commu|nity, as that knowledge and judgment which age and experience teach and inculcate. The ob&s;ervation is true, if applied to the individ|ual; more important &s;till, if applicable to &s;mall communities; of the la&s;t con&s;equence, when applied to an exten&s;ive empire. A country like the American continent, who&s;e coa&s;t is more than &s;ixteen hundred miles, who&s;e inte|rior &s;tretches far to the wilderne&s;s, as it po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es variety of clime, &s;oil, and atmo&s;phere, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to predicate di&s;&s;imilarity
<PB N="7" REF="035024_0005_0FFFEA9F819AB4A0">
of manners, habits, and even morals; and when we contemplate America, as the re&s;er|voir for emigration from every clime and nation in Europe, the city of refuge for the oppre&s;&s;ed of the earth, it is by no means &s;trange that this variety of manners, habits, and morals &s;hould be increa&s;ed. Ab&s;urd then, mu&s;t be the idea, that a NATIONAL CHARACTER &s;hould be born in a day; time mu&s;t a&s;&s;imilate, intercour&s;e and experience mu&s;t familiarize American manners to produce a uniform national characteri&s;tic.</P>
<P>THE time is now come when our attention &s;hould be awakened to this important &s;ubject. Experience teaches us, there is nothing of &s;uch intimate importance to the individual as a purity and con&s;i&s;tency of character. Anal|ogy leads us to anticipate all this importance, as equally appropriate to the body politic. If it is advantageous to the individual to have a character that may conciliate the e&s;teem and affection of men, procure him confidence and re&s;pect from neighbours and acquaintance, much more beneficial is it to the community to po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame advantage.</P>
<P>A PERIOD of more than individual man|hood has elap&s;ed &s;ince America was declared
<PB N="8" REF="035024_0006_0FFFEAA1E8C750D8">
free and independent. This time has been filled with the mo&s;t intere&s;ting events that hi&s;tory ever recorded. We have &s;een thirteen colonies like thirteen brethren, united in &s;elf-defence again&s;t the aggre&s;&s;ions of an unfeeling parent. In&s;pired with liberty they ever en|joyed, di&s;daining a yoke their fathers would not wear; we have &s;een them formed in a common band to defend their rights, or die in the attempt. We have been a&s;toni&s;hed at a &s;eries of &s;ucce&s;s, which for the undi&s;ciplined &s;tate of the country, and the want of proper means of defence, has never been equalled &s;ince the age of miracles cea&s;ed. An indi&s;|creet parent has been compelled to acknow|ledge her error, to withdraw her commands, armies, and fleets; and America has drawn the boundary line again&s;t Briti&s;h rapacity, &s;aying in the language of freedom, "hither|to &s;halt thou go, but no further."</P>
<P>THE conclu&s;ion of the revolutionary war forms a period in American hi&s;tory that can never be forgot. Without an e&s;tabli&s;hed gov|ernment; without laws that could operate beyond mere recommendations; receiving an army, returning from victory, and unpaid for exalted &s;ervices; without re&s;ources, and with|out arrangement; the &s;ober good &s;en&s;e of A|mericans,
<PB N="9" REF="035024_0007_0FFFEAA374707BF8">
joined to the advice of a WASH|INGTON, induced a band of heroes to re|ly on the ju&s;tice of that country they had de|fended for compen&s;ation; and every man re|turned to his own home.</P>
<P>HERE we &s;ee what has only been prophe&s;i|ed in hi&s;tory: a nation peaceably returning to a &s;tate of nature, and calmly deliberating how they would chu&s;e to be governed in future. The fathers of the country, the wi&s;e of the age the patriotic of the day, are &s;oon &s;elected by the free &s;uffrage of the people, to meet, and deliberate on a form of government. The patience of inve&s;tigation appeared to be pro|portionate to the magnitude of the &s;ubject. The re&s;ult of their deliberations are &s;ubmitted to the people, who, in an a&s;&s;embly of their delegates, ratified and confirmed it, as the con|&s;titution of government for America. When this work was completed, the choice of the people &s;elected men eminent for talents and abilities to compo&s;e their fir&s;t Congre&s;s, and clothed them with authority, to originate laws and execute them according to the con&s;titu|tion.</P>
<P>FROM the adoption of the con&s;titution to the pre&s;ent time, we have been making the
<PB N="10" REF="035024_0008_0FFFEAA524C39B18">
experiment, which no other nation has made before us, the efficacy of a REPRESENTA|TIVE DEMOCRACY unoriginated in con|que&s;t, and free from all feudal tenures and embarra&s;&s;ments, where liberty in its mo&s;t rational latitude is enjoyed. The novelty of this &s;cene, and its operation on the minds of more than three millions of people, &s;cattered over &s;uch an extent of territory, has been happy beyond a parallel. The con&s;titution was predicated on the &s;uppo&s;ition of di&s;&s;imil|arity in manners, intere&s;ts, and feelings of tho&s;e, for who&s;e benefit it was made; and may therefore be con&s;idered as the "re&s;ult of a &s;pirit of amity, mutual conce&s;&s;ion, and defer|ence, which the peculiarity of our political &s;ituation rendered indi&s;pen&s;able. Individuals, entering into &s;ociety, and agreeing on a form of government as the criterion of public con|duct, nece&s;&s;arily give up a certain portion of their liberty to &s;ecure the re&s;t; but to draw the dividing line, between the power granted and the liberty retained, has ever been con&s;id|ered by all legi&s;lators as a mo&s;t difficult ta&s;k: and the difficulty is increa&s;ed, when the va|riety of manners and habits of thirteen &s;tates are taken into view.</P>
<P>THAT the federal con&s;titution would meet the entire approbation of every &s;tate in the
<PB N="11" REF="035024_0009_0FFFEAA96F56DDB0">
union, much le&s;s of every individual of each &s;tate, was never to be expected. Particular intere&s;ts could never be con&s;idered without injury to the whole. A con&s;olidation of the union, in which the exi&s;tence, &s;afety, and pro&s;perity of the nation was involved, appears the leading &s;entiment, the governing motives, in forming and ratifying the con&s;titution of the federal government. A period mentioned for its revi&s;ion or amendment, if it &s;hall then be thought nece&s;&s;ary, &s;hews, that the experi|ment was to be made, whether it was adapted to the views, &s;entiments, and intere&s;ts of the American continent.</P>
<P>THE experiment of a new government has ever formed an epoch in the character of na|tions; and perhaps the mo&s;t &s;udden altera|tions in their character have originated prin|cipally from this &s;ource. The form of gov|ernment is to the community, what education is to the individual. The emperor Julian, once &s;aid of the French, "I like them, be|cau&s;e like me, they are grave and &s;erious:" little of this is now to be &s;een. The mo&s;t &s;udden alteration of character that can take place in a nation, is produced by a revolution; when the people pa&s;s at once from liberty to &s;lavery, or from &s;lavery to liberty. What
<PB N="12" REF="035024_0010_0FFFEAABDA8A9610">
nation ever exhibited more patrioti&s;m or love of liberty than the Romans, before the eleva|tion of the Cae&s;ars, and what people could di&s;cover more weakne&s;s or depravity, when they became &s;ubject to ma&s;ters? What na|tion in Europe was more attached to monar|chy, and the per&s;on of their &s;overeign, than the French, prior to their revolution, and what nation have ever defiled the annals of hi&s;tory like them, for cruelty to their king, and hatred of monarchy? If there is no &s;uch &s;triking contra&s;t of character in Americans, it is becau&s;e Americans never were &s;laves. Ex|perience then proves that the character and &s;pirit of a people change with their external circum&s;tances; and that "different govern|ments give alternately to the &s;ame nation, a character noble or ba&s;e, firm or fickle, cour|ageous or cowardly." Monarchy may form one character; ari&s;tocracy a &s;econd; democ|racy a third. Commerce has characterized Holland; agriculture the &s;tates of Germany and Spain.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t writers on the characters of na|tions, generally have con&s;idered phy&s;ical cau&s;es as much le&s;s operative in the production of characteri&s;tics than moral; the latter imply|ing &s;uch things as operate on the public mind,
<PB N="13" REF="035024_0011_0FFFEAAD66138348">
in the way of motives or rea&s;ons, to induce a certain &s;et of opinions, habits, and modes of conduct; and among the moral cau&s;es that have this influence, may be reckoned the re|ligion, government, revolutions, re&s;ources, and local connexions of a country.</P>
<P>IT is true indeed, that air, food, and cli|mate have their influence on animals; the brutal &s;pecies of one clime may differ from the &s;ame &s;pecies in another: yet on man, this uniformity of effect is interrupted by his reflective powers. China is remarkable for uniformity of character, yet the air and cli|mate of that va&s;t extended empire, is &s;urpri&s;|ingly various. Thebes and Athens were but a &s;hort days journey from each other, and yet the Athenians were as remarkable for in|genuity, politene&s;s, and gaiety, as the The|bans were for dulne&s;s and ru&s;ticity. Rivers and mountains &s;eparate nations, who&s;e char|acters form a perfect contra&s;t. Europe, A&s;ia, and America have not, by their various climes, changed the national character of the Jew, Turk, or Greek.</P>
<P>NATIONAL characters, not originating in fixed moral cau&s;es, are &s;ometimes produced from cau&s;es accidental. If a Brutus is rai&s;ed to au|thority,
<PB N="14" REF="035024_0012_0FFFEAAEF182DDA0">
and will &s;acrifice his &s;on if he violates the laws; or if a WASHINGTON will &s;acri|fice private intere&s;t to public good; &s;uch in|&s;tances will do much to form a national char|acteri&s;tic; and, "whatever that is, which forms the national features, the &s;ucceeding generation will imbibe a deeper tincture of the &s;ame dye."</P>
<P>IF we attempt to mention the mo&s;t u&s;ual &s;ources from which a national character orig|inates, we mu&s;t begin with religion, as laying the foundation.</P>
<P>THE greate&s;t legi&s;lators of antiquity have judged it impo&s;&s;ible to rai&s;e &s;uch mutual con|fidence among men, as to form a government or &s;upport it, without the aid of religion. Cicero exerts all his eloquence to prove, "that a proper reverence for the gods is the only proper ba&s;is of civil government, order, and happine&s;s in a commonwealth." If common want, or common danger, have united men for a time, while fear, novelty, or enthu&s;ia&s;m have been predominant, yet, when ea&s;e and tranquillity are re&s;tored, and time given for the operation of the private pa&s;&s;ions; in&s;tan|ces of the continuance of a regular government are &s;aid not to be found, independent of relig|ious
<PB N="15" REF="035024_0013_0FFFEAB24D26A360">
principles. "It is religious principle, by the &s;anction of an oath, which binds a peo|ple to their rulers, and rulers to the people;" and the univer&s;al cu&s;tom of demanding it from all in authority; the important light in which it has been viewed, as the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ecurity, both of veracity in a&s;&s;erting, and fidelity in promi&s;ing, which one man can give another, is proof of the po&s;ition; which cu&s;|tom could never have obtained, without an an|tecedent opinion, deeply rooted in the minds of men, that a belief of a Deity, and a &s;en&s;e of his being the witne&s;s and judge of our con|duct, was one of the &s;tronge&s;t engagements to act ju&s;tly and hone&s;tly with one another.</P>
<P>INFORM individuals ever &s;o frequently, that their private intere&s;t is connected with the public good, and that hence is derived their obligation to &s;upport government, law, and &s;ubordination, and you will find, "that the empire of &s;ocial laws cannot be &s;eparated from the &s;upports of religion." Place the origin of your property as far back as you plea&s;e; let the rich tell the poor their e&s;tates are de|&s;cended through many generations; and their reply may be this: "Your di&s;tinctions of property are all wrong; all men are equal; your notions of ju&s;tice were e&s;tabli&s;hed for
<PB N="16" REF="035024_0014_0FFFEAB599C96508">
the few, at the expen&s;e of the many: we &s;ee no equality in the world, we declare war with your palaces, but peace with cottages:" come to a divi&s;ion, for we will not be "hew|ers of wood, or drawers of water," unle&s;s you are &s;tronge&s;t. Will you oppo&s;e this rea&s;on|ing, by pleading the inju&s;tice of a new divi&s;|ion? What care they for ju&s;tice, &s;ince you have told them, "there is no God but rea&s;on, and that death is an everla&s;ting &s;leep." They will &s;ay your laws of ju&s;tice were framed by the rich to oppre&s;s the poor; that the wants of the former bear no proportion to the ne|ce&s;&s;ities of the latter; and that the fate of the mo&s;t numerous part of every community is fixed in wretchedne&s;s, &s;o long as the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of law and &s;ubordination continues. Far be it then from philo&s;ophy to produce conviction again&s;t per&s;onal intere&s;t by preach|ing ju&s;tice: a more commanding influence is wanted, and religion alone po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it. The ba&s;is of government and law, is laid in the priority of religious opinions, to which all laws are allied, and by the influence of which, they alone can be maintained.</P>
<P>UNDER the influence of religious opinions, the face of the moral world changes, and &s;o|ciety becomes a ble&s;&s;ing. Rulers pre&s;ide
<PB N="17" REF="035024_0015_0FFFEAB723E97B40">
with &s;ecurity to them&s;elves; and are not ne|ce&s;&s;arily &s;urrounded with the military power of the nation, to &s;ave their heads from the guillotine, or compelled to cru&s;h, by the mo&s;t arbitrary mea&s;ures, all competitors for power. The peaceable, inoffen&s;ive &s;ubject has all the &s;ecurity, with regard to life, liberty, and pro|perty, that the "&s;en&s;e of an Almighty pro|tection in his own brea&s;t, or the &s;uppo&s;ed awe of Almighty power, in the heart of others, can po&s;&s;ibly give him;" while all who are di&s;|po&s;ed to be unju&s;t, contentious, and ho&s;tile, mu&s;t fir&s;t break loo&s;e from all the ties of in|tere&s;t and con&s;cience, and to come at the life, liberty, and property of others; expo&s;e them|&s;elves to the penalty of human laws, and the di&s;plea&s;ure of Heaven, and be literally fools, before they can be knaves.</P>
<P>IF we &s;uppo&s;e religion nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport civil government, and lay the foundation of a national character; yet it mu&s;t be granted, much of the utility of religion will depend on the nature of it. All kinds of religion that have been profe&s;&s;ed in the world, have not had the &s;ame happy tendency on &s;ociety, gov|ernment, and laws. A religion, which repre|&s;ents the Deity, as cruel and arbitrary, armed with power, only to inflict mi&s;ery; ea&s;ily pro|voked,
<PB N="18" REF="035024_0016_0FFFEAB8AF3B9D20">
and implacable when angry; mu&s;t excite di&s;gu&s;t, and &s;pread gloom and horror over the mind; &s;our the human di&s;po&s;ition, and beget a dark, un&s;ocial, &s;u&s;picious temper, that will pervade the whole conduct. The &s;en&s;ations man mu&s;t feel to a being of this character, are the &s;en&s;ations of a &s;lave towards his ma&s;ter. The government formed, the laws in&s;tituted, the habits and manners gen|erated, will partake of all that inhumanity and cruelty, the natural re&s;ult of &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>BUT, if the religion of a country repre&s;ents the Deity po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all po&s;&s;ible perfection, combined in one undivided e&s;&s;ence, wherein infinite wi&s;dom, power, and goodne&s;s are unit|ed; tenderly concerned for the welfare of his offspring; making provi&s;ion for their temporal enjoyment and eternal felicity; the pre&s;ent witne&s;s and future judge of all their con|duct, and who will finally reward every one according to his works: If this religion rep|re&s;ents all virtue as a tran&s;cript of his moral perfections; and what he mu&s;t ever be inclin|ed to inculcate on all his offspring; as being in it&s;elf, what he loves and approves, and in the increa&s;e and di&s;play of which, his glory, and his creatures' happine&s;s mu&s;t forever con|&s;i&s;t; the mo&s;t natural con&s;equence of &s;uch
<PB N="19" REF="035024_0017_0FFFEABD001178A8">
conceptions, will be corre&s;pondent &s;en&s;ations towards this Being, a love and veneration for him, as the &s;ource of excellence; a humble im|itation of his perfections; a love and good will towards all the creatures he has made. The right or wrong conceptions man has formed of his Maker, have given a ca&s;t to all his rea|&s;onings, principles, and conduct. The tran&s;i|tion from the reverence, to the imitation, of the Being wor&s;hipped; whether he be con|ceived good or bad, is both ea&s;y and natural. Mount Gerizim had anciently, vi&s;itants of one de&s;cription; the valley of Hinnom, another.</P>
<P>WHILE &s;uper&s;tition mi&s;takes the God of ju&s;tice for the God of vengeance; and can view him in no other attitude, but with the uplifted thunderbolt, well may this account for the long catalogue of heathen deities, in ancient mythology; the ab&s;urd rites, cruel laws, and oppre&s;&s;ive cu&s;toms of Pagan an|tiquity: and this may be the rea&s;on of that unfeeling barbarity, which, prior to chri&s;tiani|ty, characterized every country of the Pagan world. A belief of lords many, and gods many; an imitation of their characters; an obedience to their commands; are, of all er|rors, the mo&s;t ancient, and of all &s;uper&s;titions, the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous to &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="035024_0018_0FFFEABE88F3E2A8">BUT the religion of our country teaches us to harmonize all perfection in one Being; and explains each attribute of his nature in perfect con&s;i&s;tency with the re&s;t. The &s;y&s;tem of faith produced, as the natural con&s;equence, is ra|tional; and the ba&s;is of political and moral virtue, well explained, permanent and la&s;ting. We have the proper motives in our religion, that produce con&s;tancy in duty; "a divine legi&s;lator, &s;peaking from heaven; an omni&s;|cient witne&s;s, beholding our conduct; an omnipotent judge, declaring he will reward or puni&s;h us, according to ju&s;tice." The&s;e mo|tives only can awe man, "&s;upport integrity, check guilt; they add to morality, the &s;olem|nity that &s;hould ever attend it, and to the ad|monitions of con&s;cience, they give the autho|rity of law:" Their co-operation with the virtuous di&s;po&s;itions of good men, en&s;ure an influence, to make them con&s;tant and per&s;e|vering, in all the duties of men and citizens. If it &s;hould be &s;aid, that great irregularities are often found in countries that profe&s;s this religion, it may be replied, the irregularity proceeds not from the religion, but from the abu&s;e of it; and what gift of heaven has not been abu&s;ed? If we are told how much war and blood&s;hed has been occa&s;ioned by chri&s;|tianity, &s;ince it has been publi&s;hed; we will
<PB N="21" REF="035024_0019_0FFFEAC0F0099798">
thank the dei&s;t to tell us, how much better the world would have been if chri&s;tianity had never been known: until which information, we beg leave to rejoice in the profe&s;&s;ion of a religion, operative and commanding in its in|fluence; a religion, that addre&s;&s;es all our pow|ers, ennobles all our faculties, and re&s;trains all our unhappy propen&s;ities; a religion, pro|po&s;ing in&s;titutions, which form the pillars of government, and without which, it mu&s;t &s;oon totter in ruin. By in&s;titutions, I mean the public wor&s;hip of God, on the weekly &s;ab|bath; the in&s;titution of marriage for life; and the &s;olemn promi&s;e of parents, in the bapti&s;m of their children, that they will bring them up, in the "nurture and admonition of the Lord."</P>
<P>SUCH being the excellency of our religion, need it be &s;aid, that Americans &s;hould be characterized as a people, who "fear God, and regard man?" ju&s;t, humane, generous in their dealings; &s;ober, reflective, determined, re&s;olute; patient, per&s;evering in all the duties of men and citizens! This character is but the natural con&s;equence of a firm belief in, and practice of, the duties of our religion.</P>
<P>IF we take off our attention from the reli|gion,
<PB N="22" REF="035024_0020_0FFFEAC27B3349E8">
and fix it on the government of our country, another &s;ource will be added, from which the American character ought to be formed.</P>
<P>NEXT in importance, to our connexion with him who made us, mu&s;t be our inter|cour&s;e with one another. Nece&s;&s;ity compels us to unite in &s;ociety; and when united, we &s;eek protection from the in&s;titution of govern|ment. We give up a part of our natural lib|erty to &s;ecure the re&s;t; and if we find no pro|tection from the government, we &s;eek it from individuals; and by &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to &s;ome dem|agogue, court that favour, which from the government was hoped for in vain. Thus anarchy is the immediate cau&s;e of tyranny. Barbarians, on this account, never enjoy lib|erty, which requires refinement in laws and in&s;titutions, and obedience to them; and &s;uch a &s;acrifice of private intere&s;t to public good, as can only re&s;ult from reflection and experience; and grow to perfection, under a regular gov|ernment. Every government &s;hould further be adapted to the local &s;ituation and character of tho&s;e, for whom it is made. It was thus in ancient times among the Jews, and in mod|ern times among the Arabs; religion was made the principal object of government, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="23" REF="035024_0021_0FFFEAC5C44CA5A0">
religion was the mo&s;t &s;ingular and pre|vailing feature of their character. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, no doubt, literature characterized the government of Athens; commerce, Tyre and Carthage; navigation, Rhodes; and war, Sparta. A free government ought al|ways to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, by affording the &s;ub|ject liberty and &s;ecurity. By liberty is meant, "a right to do what the laws of &s;ociety have neither po&s;itively, nor impliedly forbidden;" and by &s;ecurity is meant, &s;uch a limitation of the &s;upreme power, and &s;uch a di&s;tribution of the &s;everal parts of it, as be&s;t en&s;ures the greate&s;t happine&s;s of the greate&s;t number. Perfect political &s;ecurity would be obtained, if the intere&s;t of rulers, and the ruled, could be rendered perfectly indi&s;tingui&s;hable; and the neare&s;t approach to this perfection of &s;ecurity, that the people can have in a free government, is, when the &s;everal portions of power, which, when united, forms the &s;upreme power, are &s;o di&s;tributed and arranged, as that interference and u&s;urpation may be prevented. This happy di&s;tribution of the &s;everal portions of power, and harmonious arrangement, to pre|vent interference, are mo&s;t plea&s;ingly illu&s;|trated in the form of government, contained in our federal con&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="035024_0022_0FFFEAC9074E4128">THE government of the United States, di&s;|tributes the &s;upreme power into three branch|es: viz. the legi&s;lative, judicial, and execu|tive: the relative importance of each branch, with limitations of their powers, is delineated, and &s;pecially de&s;cribed in the con&s;titution; by which limitations and re&s;trictions, checks and balances, are formed for the mutual pre|&s;ervation of the whole. Our government then, is a government of checks and balances, mix|ed in its nature, and like the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem, can only be pre&s;erved, when every part retains its ju&s;t and harmonious proportion of power. This mixed form of government, has been clearly demon&s;trated, by &s;everal writers, of high eminence in the literary world; and by none more forcibly, than by our beloved Chief Magi&s;trate, as containing the mo&s;t complex provi&s;ion of liberty and &s;afety for the people; and uniting the two e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ites for gov|ernment, wi&s;dom and &s;trength, in the highe&s;t, and yet &s;afe&s;t degree.</P>
<P>OUR national liberty, undoubtedly con&s;i&s;ts in governing our&s;elves, according to our nat|ural rights: and, as we were never &s;laves to foreigners abroad, or any cla&s;s of men at home; &s;o neither the many of any other country, nor the few of our own, have any right to dictate

to us, what government to adopt, as to form, nor how it &s;hall be admini&s;tered.</P>
<P>THE con&s;titution of the federal government guarantees to the individual &s;tates in the union, a republican form of government, with lib|erty to make &s;uch laws, as do not interfere or oppo&s;e, the general admini&s;tration. It grants each &s;tate protection from foreign ene|mies, and internal commotion and &s;edition. It grants each individual American, the enjoy|ment of all per&s;onal advantages he may acquire, without injury to others; with the rights of per&s;onal &s;ecurity, property, liberty of ac|tion, reputation, opinion, &s;peech, and religion. But even the&s;e are not granted, without this nece&s;&s;ary limitation; that they &s;hould be &s;o exerci&s;ed and enjoyed, as may be con&s;i&s;tent with the like privileges in others. This &s;eems the con&s;titutional idea of equality. It does not mean that the &s;ame degrees of wealth, or power, &s;hould be enjoyed by every individ|ual of the community; but that property merely &s;hould be no title to power; and that power &s;hould never be exerci&s;ed, contrary to law, and the con&s;titution. In &s;hort, equality, under the form of government we have adopt|ed, con&s;i&s;ts &s;ummarily in this, that like priv|ileges, &s;hould be extended to like per&s;ons, in like circum&s;tances.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="035024_0024_0FFFEACDE66C8858">THESE &s;eem the rights &s;ecured to individ|uals, and to the &s;everal &s;tates in the union, by the con&s;titution of our general government; the branches of which are equally &s;upreme, coequal, and coeval; deriving their power and energy from the &s;ame &s;ource&mdash;the will of the people. And &s;uch is the nice adju&s;tment and di&s;tribution of power, that each mu&s;t, and ought fairly to exerci&s;e its own functions, and neither check or u&s;urp the powers of each other. When this is the ca&s;e, the government is harmonious, and all that liberty is enjoyed under it, which government can give, or the mo&s;t complex provi&s;ion, for the liberty of the people can en&s;ure. This &s;acred palladium of American liberty, the con&s;titution, like the law of te&s;timonies of the Hebrew polity, is the great &s;tandard of political rectitude to Americans; the polar &s;tar, by which they are to be guided, in all their political di&s;qui&s;itions, and legi&s;lative conduct.</P>
<P>NEED it be added, that a &s;econd feature in the American character, ought to be an un|conquerable love of liberty; a decided pref|erence of a government of laws, to a govern|ment of men; that they ought to guard their independence from all foreign intrigue and dictation; and their con&s;titution and laws, from violation and interruption?</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="035024_0025_0FFFEACF85382E80">THE revolution we have experienced, can|not but have an influence in forming our char|acter. This revolution, for the honour of America, did not originate in a mad ambition for independence; nor in a de&s;ire to live with|out government, &s;ubordination, and religion; but in a de&s;ire to enjoy unimpaired, the rights of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects. When Britain a&s;&s;umed a right to tax us, without our con&s;ent, and bind us by laws, when we were not repre&s;ented; after petitioning in vain, we drew the &s;word for pre&s;ervation, not for conque&s;t; to pre&s;erve the rights we had, rather than to acquire more. When our &s;truggle was crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, we manife&s;ted the principle, for which we fought, by an immediate attention to the in&s;titution of a form of government, founded on the principles of liberty and equity.</P>
<P>IT has ever been the object then, of Ameri|cans, to &s;upport government, order, and the reign of equal laws: that anarchy &s;hould be prevented; that a free, generous &s;ubordina|tion and obedience to the con&s;tituted authori|ties &s;hould prevail; that jealou&s;y &s;hould at|tend all attempts of foreign influence; and while we are careful not to interfere in the government of other nations, no nation &s;hall

<P>IF from the revolution, we turn our atten|tion to the re&s;ources of our country, &s;ome cor|re&s;pondent impre&s;&s;ions will be made on the public mind.</P>
<P>THE &s;ituation of the American continent; its &s;oil and climate; its extent of coa&s;t; its fi&s;heries, and other local advantages, evident|ly de&s;ignate us, as an agricultural and com|mercial nation. The earth produces the nece&s;&s;aries of life in abundance, with &s;ome of its luxuries; and internal commerce may ren|der us almo&s;t, if not quite, independent, on any foreign clime. The raw materials, which are more than the inhabitants can manufac|ture, or con&s;ume; the fi&s;heries on our &s;hores; the &s;eamen on our capes and bays, de&s;ignate us, as our own carriers to other nations, if re|ciprocity and fair dealing can be obtained: and if not, our fore&s;ts &s;upply the materials, and our mechanics can fa&s;hion them into wooden walls of defence; or we may with|hold &s;upplies from tho&s;e who want our prod|uce, until terms of accommodation can take place.</P>

While young we &s;tood unmoved, again&s;t one power in Europe; &s;hall we ba&s;ely &s;ubmit to the dictation of another? Let us rather appreciate our own country, while we are thus favoured of Heaven; and guard again&s;t &s;elling it, "for le&s;s than a me&s;s of pottage."</P>
<P>AND when we con&s;ider the po&s;ition of our country, as it re&s;pects Europe; that an ocean of three thou&s;and miles, &s;eparates this happy land, from older governments; what ought we to expect le&s;s than this; that as little con|nexion as po&s;&s;ible with other nations, will al|ways be our policy?

<P>FROM the&s;e materials, a character ought to be formed; from the&s;e &s;ources it ought to originate. Americans ought to be character|ized, as firmly attached to the religion of their fathers; partial to the government of

<P>"We have heard with our ears, and our fathers have told us," that "righteou&s;ne&s;s, exalts a nation; while &s;in is a reproach to any people." This venerable maxim of ethics, has been taught us by that religion, for the enjoyment and unmole&s;ted profe&s;|&s;ion of which, our fathers left the endear|ments of connexions and friends, cro&s;&s;ed the Atlantic, and began a &s;ettlement in the Amer|ican wilderne&s;s. It was this religion that formed the ba&s;is of their laws. They de|clared it the foundation of their hopes, the &s;ource of their con&s;olation in every di&s;tre&s;&s;ing period. To tran&s;mit this religion, with the pure wor&s;hip of God, and the rights of con|&s;cience, to their children, animated them in their labours, and con&s;oled them in their di&s;|tre&s;&s;es. Little did they think their children

That the &s;criptures were contradictory; a compo&s;ition of fal&s;e|hood; contrived by politicians, and the in|&s;trument of tyranny, for prie&s;ts and impo&s;tors. Little did tho&s;e venerable men, who fir&s;t in|culcated the precepts of the go&s;pel, in the in|fant &s;ettlements of this country think, that not two centuries would elap&s;e, before their a&s;hes would be in&s;ulted, with publications, that "defame God, and di&s;honour man." Little did they think, any of their true de&s;cendants would believe, "man was &s;eparated from God and time from eternity," that blindne&s;s needs no guide, and perver&s;ene&s;s no re&s;traint. Could they have conceived, that &s;ociety would be declared, happy without principle, and gov|ernment without religion? That the &s;abbath was a nui&s;ance; public wor&s;hip prie&s;tcraft; prayer a dictation to the Almighty, and prai&s;e &s;uper&s;tition. That marriage was tyranny, property a prejudice, and the reign of law, the enforcement of arbitrary power? It was not probable believers would be multiplied, in the&s;e doctrines; or that a quixotic love for the univer&s;e, was to be expre&s;&s;ed, by a hatred of that part of it we inhabit: or that to aid foreigners in their views of univer&s;al

<P>NEXT to an attempt to corrupt our reli|gion, may be ranked the endeavours to &s;ub|vert our government.</P>
<P>COULD it once be imagined, that Ameri|cans who deliberately formed and e&s;tabli&s;hed their own government; who freely chu&s;e and inve&s;t their own rulers; who &s;ee them po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ame intere&s;ts and feelings with them&s;elves, &s;hould ever encourage in&s;idious attempts to divide the people from their gov|ernment? Con&s;idering the form of govern|ment we have adopted, is there one hone&s;t man on the continent who does not &s;ee, that to magnify one branch of it to the di&s;parage|ment of the other, is to de&s;troy it? Who ever loved or &s;upported his friend by halves? and who does not know, that every con&s;truction
<PB N="34" REF="035024_0032_0FFFEADFC6D76760">
of the con&s;titution, which tends to magnify one branch at the expen&s;e of the other, tends to interrupt its harmony, and de&s;troy its u&s;e|fulne&s;s? If for in&s;tance the executive power u&s;urps the legi&s;lative; or the legi&s;lative the executive; or the judicial either; &s;uch inter|ference de&s;troys the unity and energy of the whole.</P>
<P>THAT in a mixed government, the popu|lar branch &s;hould be jealous of the judicial and executive, is by no means new or unexpect|ed: "Vigilance is laudable, undue jealou&s;y is de&s;tructive." It may ari&s;e to &s;uch height as to bring on interference and conte&s;t for power, and finally, end in the monopoly of all power in one branch: and when ever this is the ca&s;e, the con&s;titution is violated; the gov|ernment is changed; the balance of power is de&s;troyed; and from being a government of laws, it becomes at once a government of men.</P>
<P>THAT attempts have been made by foreign intrigue and inte&s;tine ambition, to excite this unrea&s;onable jealou&s;y; that the people have been flattered at the expen&s;e of their govern|ment, no candid American can doubt. The
<PB N="35" REF="035024_0033_0FFFEAE31E8EA1C0">
powers ve&s;ted by the con&s;titution in the exec|utive, have been examined and re-examined; and the exerci&s;e of this power carefully com|pared with the limits pre&s;cribed in the con&s;ti|tution; and when it was found that in no in|&s;tance has this power been exceeded, the next &s;tep was, "&s;o to con&s;true the con&s;titution, as impliedly to charge the executive with a con|duct exceeding its bounds. This was the &s;pirit of the attack re&s;pecting the treaty; and the &s;ame &s;pirit &s;hewed it&s;elf in the amendment to the bill on foreign intercour&s;e. The treaty was a proper &s;ubject to excite jea|lou&s;y, as it was in many parts of the conti|nent very unpopular; the people not po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing the means of judging were again&s;t it then; though now they &s;eem generally convinced of the wi&s;dom and policy of the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>THE views of tho&s;e who directed the&s;e at|tacks on the executive, become apparent from this circum&s;tance; that if the con&s;titution was violated, he ought to have been impeach|ed: this was not done, and we have a right to conclude, that the executive acted within the pale of the con&s;titution. If the executive
<PB N="36" REF="035024_0034_0FFFEAE66C87DB48">
acted within the pale of the con&s;titution, an attempt to re&s;train him in the exerci&s;e of con&s;titutional power is interference; unle&s;s the con&s;titution gives him too much power; and if this be the ca&s;e, the error is in the con|&s;titution, and not in him who admini&s;ters it.</P>
<P>BUT will Americans &s;uffer the&s;e attempts to go unpuni&s;hed? They will not; they know that a "hou&s;e divided again&s;t it&s;elf cannot &s;tand;" they will puni&s;h attempts to divide the government. They will rally round the &s;tandard of union, and will remember, that if a republican government cannot exi&s;t and be maintained in America, it can exi&s;t no where but on paper, or in the vi&s;ions of philo&s;o|phers. They will appreciate the ble&s;&s;ings they enjoy, and feel the duty of tran&s;mitting them to po&s;terity. They will remember their maxim, "UNITED WE STAND, DIVIDED WE FALL;" and while they &s;ee the con&s;titu|tion re&s;pected, the laws executed, and their rulers attached to their own country and its freedom, will yield them at all times re&s;pect and &s;upport.</P>

We under&s;tand this better in America. We fought for the rights of men and citizens; for that ju&s;tice which was denied us in jealou&s;y; and when it was gained by our arms, we retired to "our vines and fig trees," determined to live "peaceably with all men." We were ju&s;t to all who a&s;&s;i&s;ted us, though the &s;ervants of none. As the i&s;&s;ue of the revolutionary war gave us a rank among the nations of the earth; it has been our object to keep our faith with all na|tions; &s;upport our own government and laws; deal with the contending powers in Europe

<P>AMERICANS are awakened; their eyes are opened to their intere&s;ts and dangers; and if for a time we were in&s;en&s;ible to aggre&s;&s;ions and not ha&s;ty in re&s;entment, indignation is deferred but to collect its force; and if ne|ce&s;&s;ity, imperious nece&s;&s;ity, compels us to the field in &s;elf defence; Americans know a WASHINGTON yet lives, and is appointed to lead his former brethren in arms; while an ADAMS in the cabinet, holds with &s;teady firmne&s;s the helm of &s;tate.
