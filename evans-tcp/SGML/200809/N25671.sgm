<HEAD>THE WAY TO MAKE MONEY PLENTY IN EVERY MAN's POCKET.</HEAD>

of money-catching&mdash;the certain way to fill empty pur|&s;es&mdash;and how to keep them always full. Two &s;imple rules-well ob&s;erved, will do the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>THE WHISTLE. A TRUE STORY.</HEAD>
<P>WHen I was a child, at &s;even years old, my friends on a holiday filled my pockets with coppers, I went directly to a &s;hop where they &s;old toys for children; and being charmed with the &s;ound of a whi&s;tle, that I met by the way in the hands of another boy, I vol|luntarily offered him all my money for one. I then came home, and went whi&s;tling all over the hou&s;e, much plea&s;ed with my whi&s;tle, but di&s;turbing all the family, my brothers and &s;i&s;ters, and cou&s;ins, under|&s;tanding the bargain I had made, told me I had given four times as much for it as it was worth. This put me in mind what good things I might have bought with the re&s;t of my money; and they laughed at me &s;o much for my folly that I cried with vexation; and the reflection gave me more chagrin than the whi&s;tle gave me plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="034092_0006_0FFA58CE4DB36688">
This however was afterwards of u&s;e to me, the im|pre&s;&s;ions continuing on my mind; &s;o that often when I was tempted to buy &s;ome unnece&s;&s;ary thing, I &s;aid to my&s;elf don't give too much for the whi&s;tle; and &s;o I &s;aved my money.</P>
<P>As I grew up, came into the world, and ob&s;erved the actions of men, I thought I met with many, very many, who gave too much for the whi&s;tle.</P>
<P>When I &s;aw any one too ambitious of court favours, &s;acrifice his time in attendance on levees, his repo&s;e, his liberty, his virtue, and perhaps his friends to attain it, I have &s;aid to my&s;elf, this man gives too much for his whi&s;tle.</P>
<P>When I &s;aw another fond of popularity, con&s;tantly employing him&s;elf in political bu&s;tles, neglecting his own affairs, and ruining them by that neglect: he pays indeed, &s;ays I, too much for his whi&s;tle.</P>
<P>If I knew a mi&s;er, who gave up every kind of com|fortable living, all the plea&s;ure of doing good to others, all the e&s;teem of his fellow citizens, and the joys of be|nevolent friend&s;hip, for the &s;ake of accumulating wealth: poor man &s;ays I, you do indeed pay too much for your whi&s;tle.</P>
<P>If I fee one fond of fine clothing, fine furniture, fine equipage, and above his fortune, for which he contracts debts, and ends his career in pri&s;on, alas, &s;ay I, he pays dear, very dear, for his whi&s;tle.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="034092_0007_0FFA57C529089F98">
When I &s;ee a beautiful, &s;weet tempered, girl married to an ill-natured brute of a hu&s;band: what a pity it is, &s;ays I, that &s;he has paid &s;o much for a whi&s;tle.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I concieve, that great part of the mi&s;eries of mankind were brought upon them by the fal&s;e e&s;ti|mates they had made of the value of things, and by their giving too much for their whi&s;tle.</P>

<HEAD>LIFE.</HEAD>
<P>AUGUSTUS, a few moments before his death, a&s;ked his friends who &s;tood about him, if they thought he had acted his part well; and upon reciev|ing &s;uch an&s;wer as was due to his extraordinary mer|it&mdash;Let me then, &s;ays he, go off the &s;tage with your applau&s;e, u&s;ing the expre&s;&s;ion with which the Roman actors made their exit at the conclu&s;ion of a dramatic piece.</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h that men, while they are in the health, would con&s;ider well the nature of the part they are en|gaged in, and what figure it will make in the minds of tho&s;e they leave behind them: whether it was worth coming into the world for; whether it be &s;uitable to a rea&s;onable being; in &s;hort, whether it appears grace|ful in this life, or will turn to advantage in the next. Let the &s;ycophant, or buffoon, the &s;atiri&s;t,

or the good companion, con&s;ider with him&s;elf, when his body &s;hall be laid in the grave: and his &s;oul pa&s;s in|to another &s;tate of exi&s;tence, how much it would re|dound to his prai&s;e to have it &s;aid of him, that no man in England eat better, that he had an admirable talent at turning his friends into ridicule, that no body out&punc; did him at an-ill-natured je&s;t, or that he never went to bed before he had di&s;patched his third bottle.</P>
<P>The&s;e are, however, very common funeral orations, and elogiums on decea&s;ed per&s;ons who have acted a|mong mankind with &s;ome figure and reputation. But if we look into the bulk of our &s;pecies, there are &s;uch as are not likely to be remembered a moment after their di&s;appearance. They leave behind them no tra|ces of their exi&s;tence, but are forgotten as though they had never been. They are neither wanted by the poor, regretted by the rich, nor celebrated by the learned. They are neither mi&s;&s;ed in the common-wealth, nor la|mented by private per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Their actions are of no &s;ignificancy to mankind, and might have been performed by creatures of much le&s;s dignity than tho&s;e who are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the fa|culty of rea&s;on. An eminent French author &s;peaks &s;omewhere to the following purpo&s;e; I have often &s;een from my chamber-window two noble creatures, both of them of an erect countenance, and endowed with

<P>My friend, Sir Andrew Freeport, as we were &s;it|ting in the club la&s;t night, gave us an account of a &s;o|ber citizen, who died a few days &s;ince. This hone&s;t man being of greater con&s;equence in his own thoughts than in the eye of the world, had for &s;ome years pa&s;t kept a journal of his life. Sir Andrew, &s;howed us one week of it. Since the occurrences &s;et down in it mark out &s;uch a road of action as that I have been &s;peaking of, I &s;hall pre&s;ent my readers with a faithful copy of it; after having fir&s;t informed him, that the decea&s;ed per&s;on had in his youth been bred to trade, but finding him&s;elf not &s;o well turned for bu&s;ine&s;s, he had for &s;everal years pa&s;t lived altogether upon a mod|erate annuity.</P>

I que&s;tion not but the readers will be &s;urpri&s;ed to find the above-mentioned journali&s;t taking &s;o much care of a life that was filled with &s;uch incon&s;iderable actions, and received &s;o very &s;mall improvements; and yet, if we look into the behavior of many whom we daily conver&s;e with, we &s;hall find mo&s;t of our hours are taken up in tho&s;e three important articles of eating, drinking and &s;leeping.</P>
<P>I do not &s;uppo&s;e that a man lo&s;es his time, who is not engaged in public affairs, or in an illu&s;trious cour&s;e of action.

<HEAD>SEVERAL RELATIONS touching the nature of tho&s;e perpetual La<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ps which have continued burning for many centuries together, &amp;c. (From the Briti&s;h Magazine.)</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE you have entertained your readers with &s;everal curious pieces, which refer to nature and art, I doubt not, but the &s;ub&s;equent pa&s;&s;ages of tho&s;e perpetual lamps which have continued burning (in the &s;epulchres of the Ancients) for many centuries to|gether, without any fre&s;h &s;upply, will prove acceptable.</P>
<P>All fire, but e&s;pecially flame, &s;ays philo&s;ophers is of an active and &s;tirring nature, and cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;ub&s;i&s;t without motion: Now there are &s;everal au|thors who have treated of this &s;ubject by the by, tho' none, &s;ays the learned and judicious Bi&s;hop Wilkins, that have writ any thing to the purpo&s;e, (except the ingenious Fortunius Licetus) from whom we &s;hall beg leave to borrow &s;ome undeniable proofs, which we hope will be &s;uitable to our pre&s;ent enquiry.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then that there hath been &s;uch lamps, St. Au&s;|tin mentions one of them in a temple dedicated to Ve|nus which was alway expo&s;ed to the open weather, and could never be extingui&s;hed; Pamyrollus mentions a lamp found in his time, in the &s;epulchre of Tulli<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, Cicero's daughter, which had continued there for 1550 years, but was pre&s;ently extingui&s;hed by the admi&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="16" REF="034092_0015_0FFA57F7C4B95DA8">
of new air. And 'tis commonly reported of Ced|renus, that in Ju&s;tinian's time there was another burning lamp found in an old wall at Antioch; which had remained for above 500 years, there being a cru|cifix placed by it; hence it appears, that they were in u&s;e with the primitive Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>But more e&s;pecially remarkable is that of Olybius, which had continued burning for 1500 years: the re|lation is this: "As a ru&s;tic was digging the ground by Padua, he found an urn, in which there was another urn, and in this a le&s;&s;er, with a lamp clearly burning; on each &s;ide of it there were two other ve&s;&s;els, both of them full of a pure liquor the one of gold, the other of &s;ilver". Hence we may probably conjecture, that it was &s;ome chemical &s;ecret by which it was contrived. Bapti&s;ta Porta, tells us of another lamp, burning in an old marble &s;epulchre belonging to &s;ome of the An|cient Romans, enclo&s;ed in a gla&s;s vial, found in his time, about the year 1550, in the I&s;b Ni&s;is which had been buried there before our Savior's incarnation.</P>
<P>In the tomb of Pallas the Areadian, who was &s;lain by Turnus in the Trojan war, there was found another burning lamp.</P>
<P>In the year of our Lord 1401, whence it would &s;eem that it had continued there for above 2600 years; and being taken out, it continued burning, not|with&s;tanding either wind or water, with which &s;ome
<PB N="17" REF="034092_0016_0FFA58FFC8D72730">
&s;trove to quench it, nor could it be extingui&s;hed till they had &s;pilt the liquor in it. Ludouicus Vives tells us of another lamp that continued burning for 1050 years, which was found a little before his time. There is another relation of a certain man, who, upon dig|ing &s;omewhat deep in the ground, met with &s;ome|thing like a door, having a wall on each hand of it, from which he cleared the earth; he farved open the door, and there di&s;covered a fair vault, toward the farther &s;ide of which was the &s;tatue of a man in armour, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">iting by a table, leaning upon his left arm, and holding a &s;ceptre in his right hand, with a lamp burning be|fore him; the floor of this vault being &s;o contrived, that upon the fir&s;t &s;tep into it, the &s;tatute erected it|&s;elf from its leaning po&s;ture, upon the &s;econd &s;tep, it lifted up the &s;ceptre to &s;trike, and before the man could approach near the lamp, to take hold of it, the &s;tatute &s;truck and broke it to pieces; &s;uch care was had that it might not be taken away, nor di&s;covered; and the learned and judicious Mr. Cambden, in his de|&s;cription of York&s;hire, page, 572, &s;peaking of the tomb of Con&s;tantius Clorus, broken up in tho&s;e times, mentions &s;uch a lamp to be found within it.</P>
<P>It is evident that there are &s;everal other relations to this purpo&s;e, be&s;ides the&s;e above mentioned, notwith|&s;tanding the oppo&s;ite opinions of our adver&s;aries, by which it clearly appears that there have been &s;uch

lamps which have remained burning for &s;everal cen|turies together, &amp;c, and there are &s;everal opinions why the Ancients were &s;o careful in pre&s;erving them, &s;ome of which we &s;hall here exhibit.</P>
<P>1&s;t. Some think it to be an expre&s;&s;ion of their be|lief, concerning the &s;oul's immortality after its de|parture out of the body; a lamp among the Egyp|tians being the hyerogliphick of life: and therefore that they that could not procure &s;uch lamps, were yet careful to have the image and repre&s;entation of them engraved upon their tombs. Others conceive them by way of gratitude to tho&s;e infernal deities, who took the charge and cu&s;tody of their body's when dead, remaining always with them in their tombs, and were therefore called Dii Manes.</P>
<P>Others, that the&s;e lamps were only intended to make their &s;epulchres more plea&s;ant, that they may not &s;eem to be impri&s;oned in a di&s;mal and uncomforta|ble place. True indeed! a dead body cannot be &s;en|&s;ible of the light, no more could it of it's want of bu|rial; yet the &s;ame in&s;tinct which did excite it to the de&s;ire of one, did al&s;o occa&s;ion the other.</P>
<P>Licetus concludes this ancient cu&s;tom to have a double end; 1&s;t. politick, for the di&s;tinction of &s;uch as were noble-born; hence it was u&s;ual for the nobles among&s;t the romans, to take &s;pecial care in their la&s;t wills, that they might have a lamp in their own monu|ments,

When &s;he &s;preadeth her delicacies on the table, when her wine &s;parkles in the cup, when &s;he &s;mileth upon thee, and per&s;uadeth thee to be joyful and happy: then is the hour of danger, and let rea&s;on &s;tand firm|ly on her guard: for if thou hearkene&s;t unto the words of her adver&s;ary, thou art decieved and betrayed.</P>

<HEAD>PRUDENCE.</HEAD>
<P>JUDGMENT is the throne of prudence, and &s;ilence is its &s;anctury. It is a maxim of prudence to leave things before they leave us. The true way to advance another's virtue, is to follow it; and the be&s;t way to decry down another's vice, is to decline it. A warm heart requires a cool head. Courage without conduct,
<PB N="32" REF="034092_0031_0FFA585D0FED7420">
is, like fancy without judgment; all <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ail, and no balla&s;t. Put a bridle on thy tongue; &s;et a guard before thy lips, le&s;t the words of thine own mouth de&s;troy thy peace.</P>
<P>Boa&s;t not of thy&s;elf, for it &s;hall bring contempt up|on thee, neither deride another for it is dangerous.</P>
<P>A bitter je&s;t is the poi&s;on of friend&s;hip, and he that cannot re&s;train his tonge; &s;hall have trouble.</P>
<P>Furni&s;h thy&s;elf with the proper accommodations be|longing to thy condition but &s;pend not the utmo&s;t of what thou can&s;t afford, that the providence of thy youth may be a comfort to thy old age. Let not pro&s;perity put out the eyes of circum&s;pection, nor a|bundance cut off the hands of frugality, he that too much indulges in the &s;uperfluities of life, &s;hall live to lament the want of it's nece&s;&s;aries. From the expe|rience of others do thou learn wi&s;dom, and from their failings correct thine own faults. Charity obliges not to mi&s;tru&s;t a man, prudence not to tru&s;t him before we know him.</P>
<P>When thou ha&s;t proved a man to be hone&s;t, look him up in thine heart as a trea&s;ure, regard him as a jewel of ine&s;timable value.</P>
<P>Refu&s;e the favours of a mercenary man, they will be a &s;nare unto thee, thou &s;halt never be quit of the obligation. U&s;e not to day what to-morrow may

want; neither leave that to hazard which fore&s;ight may provide for, or can prevent.</P>
<P>Yet expect not even from prudence infallible &s;uc|ce&s;s; for the day knoweth not what the night may bring forth.</P>

<HEAD>FORTITUDE.</HEAD>
<P>PERILS, mi&s;fortunes, pain, and injury, are more or le&s;s the lot of every man that cometh into the world.</P>
<P>In human life there is a con&s;tant change of fortune, and it is unrea&s;onable to expect from the common fate. Life it&s;elf decays, and all things are daily on the change.</P>
<P>Imprint this maxim deeply in your mind, that there is nothing certain in this human and mortal &s;tate; by which means you will avoid being tran&s;ported with pro&s;perity and being dejected in adver&s;ity.</P>
<P>A wi&s;e man &s;tands firm in all extremities, and bears the lot of his humanity with a divine temper.</P>
<P>He &s;uffers not his happine&s;s to depend on her &s;miles, and with her frowns he will not be di&s;mayed.</P>
<P>Under the pre&s;&s;ure of his misfortunes, his calmne&s;s alleviates their weight, and his con&s;tancy &s;hall &s;urmount them.</P>

without end or mea&s;ure; this con&s;ummate &s;tate of felicity is a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the dictates of right nature; the foundation of its wi&s;dom and virtue; the know|ledge of what we ought do, and the conformity of the will to that knowledge. Every virtue gives a man a de|gree of felicity in &s;ome kind: hone&s;ty gives a man a good report; ju&s;tice, e&s;timation; prudence, re&s;pect&punc; courte&s;y and liberallity, affection; temperence, gives health; fortitude, a quiet mind, not to be moved by any adver&s;ity.</P>
<P>Virtue is a ble&s;&s;ing, which man alone po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, and no other creature has any title to but him&s;elf. All is nothing without her, and &s;he alone is all.
