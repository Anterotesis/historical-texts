<HEAD>I. PROPOSITIONS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. PROP. [Not to meddle with our Morals.] <HI>We are Defective in Nothing, or in Nothing &s;o much as in the want of a Sufficient Medium of Trade.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the Happie&s;t Days we have &s;een for this Fifty or Sixty Years la&s;t pa&s;t. We have now, with full Satisfaction found Protection, and Umbrage under the Wings of a Prote&s;tant Prince, who holds the Ballance of <HI>Europe:</HI> And De&s;ires to be in nothing Greater, then in the Happine&s;s of His People. There be now no <HI>Machiavilian Councils</HI> held near the Throne how to In&s;lave the Nation; But all is Contrived now to Render it Free, Rich, Great and Powerful. So that things are very Happy at Home. And this Pro|vince al&s;o is under Halcion, and very Joyful Circum|&s;tances, being Headed by a GOVERNOUR who imi|tates his Ma&s;ter in his Royal Vertues, his Courage, Ju&s;tice, Clemency, and other Enobling Qualifications which Adorn a Prince. And to perfect our happine&s;s we enjoy the Go&s;pel Liberties, without Infringment; together with Health, Peace and Plenty.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002311_0007_0FDB1EFBAEB77CE8">And yet our <HI>Medium of Trade</HI> is &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">xceeding &s;hort, and in&s;ufficient that Bu&s;ine&s;s begins to Clogg; or does not go on &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oundly as it might do, were it more re|dundant and full. As for the Money Medium we have none at all, its quite Exhau&s;ted; and the Bills which have &s;upplyed its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lace, they are grown very &s;carce, which is evident by the Loud Complaints of Town and Country.</P>
<P N="2">II. PROP. <HI>Temporal Commerce and Trade, is as nece&s;&s;ary for the Conveniency, Comfort and Outward Profit of Man, whil&s;t he holds his T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nure on Earth, as Civil Alliance and Cohabitation.</HI> For that it may be &s;aid of Single Per&s;ons and Families, as well as of Countries. <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n Omnis fert Onmia Tellus.</HI> All Men as all Nations dont rai&s;e all things that are for their Benefit &amp; Comfort; therefore Trade is very needful. Tho' it be certain, That Trade &amp; Commerce may be managed or carryed on, e&s;pecially by di&s;tant Parts of the World; and in &s;ome Ca&s;es by Per&s;ons of the &s;ame Country by Exchange and Trucking one Com|modity for another; let them be what they will. Yet we mu&s;t note, That this Method in Bu&s;ine&s;s, is fitter for &s;uch a People, who (to indulge them&s;elves in great Idlene&s;s &amp; Sloath,) Dwell in the Clefts of the Valleys, in Caves of the Earth, and in the Rocks, and d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gg <HI>Juniper Roots</HI> for their Meat, or can Live upon <HI>Acorns:</HI> But it is not at all agreable with a Wi&s;e and Fu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing People, that would &s;pend their Life, to the heigth of Religion, and right Rea&s;on.

For that the in|conveniencies that will attend a Common Barter with|out a Medium are innumerable and intollerable. As to mention but one. In this way, unle&s;s both the

And indeed its hardly p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ible to uphold Equality where there is no Common Medium known and allowed of to be as a Rule or Mea&s;ure between them. Therefore,</P>
<P N="3">III. PROP. <HI>All Prudent M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n and Civil Nations, upon long Experience, find that a Convenient Me|dium mu&s;t be had, and made u&s;e of to Support Trade and Commerce with due Advantage.</HI> Two Things may be ob&s;erved under this Propo&s;ition,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A Medium of Trade need not be Co&s;tly, if it be but Convenient and Safe.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The more Co&s;t and Intrin&s;ick Worth a Medium carries with it, or the more Valuable it is in it &s;elf, the le&s;s u&s;eful it will be in &s;upporting an Univer&s;al Trade and Commerce.</HI> Which will be evident by a Compari&s;on fairly Run between the Money and Paper Medium; upon a Pre&s;umption the latter is upon good Security, and found at Bottom.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Money Medium from its co&s;tly and valua|ble nature, is very inconstant, unfixt and volatile.</HI> Few Governments can Lock their own Doors &s;o clo&s;e, but that it is apt to Steal away and make its e&s;cape: whenas the other is con&s;tant, abiding, &amp; keeps within its own Circuits. The Money is a &s;taple Commodity, and univer&s;ally acceptable in all ports of Trade; and then being &s;huffling and always lyable to Exporta|tion, there is no Depending upon it for carrying on any Bu&s;ine&s;s in a &s;teady way; for if Men enter into &s;ome Wi&s;e and Great Ingagements with a confidence in the Money Medium, away it &s;lips; leaves them in the lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ch; to &s;olve, un&s;olvable <HI>Obligations,</HI> and
<PB N="6" REF="002311_0009_0FDB1F022F0BBB50">
po&s;&s;ibly to their undoing. But now on the other hand, whatever valuable De&s;igns Men &s;et forward upon the Reputation of the Paper Medium, being always at home, they may in their prudent Conduct, acquie&s;ce and depend upon it, with the greate&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Money Medium is not only Good Merchan|dise; but bring of &s;o durable and rich a nature, it is a very fine E&s;tate for the Wi&s;e and Fortunate to &s;e|cure among&s;t their intended Beque&s;tment for the next Age.</HI> To <HI>lay up Gold as the Du&s;t, and the Gold of Ophir as the Stones of the Bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k,</HI> &s;eems a Promi&s;e a ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to that Rule of Duty whereby Parents are ob|liged to lay up for their Children; That when Men are in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, either from Avar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce, Prudence, Duty, or good Nature to their own, are very doth to part with this charming Specie. And tho' it may go from them with le&s;s pain then when their Skin is &s;tript from their Fingers, yet it comes away with much aver&s;ion. For of this Specie it may be &s;aid, <HI>Sui Nimi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> Tenax.</HI> So that it cannot rationally be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o convenient a Medium to &s;upport a common Barter and Commu|tation among&s;t all Men, as that which is le&s;s valuable in its own Nature, and &s;o Per&s;ons are more apt to part with it.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Money Medium inclines Men more to Ex|tortion. Di&s;&s;embling, and other Moral Evils in Trade, then One which has no Intrin&s;ick Value in it.</HI> They are the Moneye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">-M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n that hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le and han<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> high upon their Terms; and u&s;ually undervalue every Commo|dity expo&s;ed to Sale. <HI>Its naught&punc; Its naught, &s;ays the Buyer;</HI> tho' he knows better when he &s;ays &s;o: And its Money you expect, and therefore you mu&s;t lower your Price, or I &s;hall not be your Chapman, &amp;c. yet di&s;&s;embles all the while. And thus under the in|&s;tance of &s;uch a high tempered Medium, Men o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Trade are fain many times to Sell with little or no Profit, or at half price, or how they can. And how
<PB N="7" REF="002311_0010_0FDB1F03A4524760">
often are Men in compa&s;&s;ing the Money Medium impelled to prevaricate with Truth. For have not &s;ome (po&s;&s;ibly in Je&s;t-Earne&s;t &s;aid, <HI>What pity it is that Lying was a Sin, it being &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in our Trade?</HI> That of this Medium we may but too &s;adly complain, and argue as once the Poet,
<Q>Auri Sacra fames, Quid non Mortalia cogis Pectora?</Q></P>
<P><HI>The Love of Money is the Root of all Evil.</HI></P>
<P>But the Paper Medium is ea&s;y of Exchange, and not &s;o apt to corrupt the Mind. So that,</P>
<P>PROP. IV. <HI>This Province can create for them|&s;elves, a Sufficient Medium, that &s;hall an&s;wer all Points of Bu&s;ine&s;s and Profit, better then Money: And that by a Publick or Private Bank of Credit; and either of them will do under the Influence, Pa|tronage, Sanctions, &amp; Awe of the Goverment.</HI></P>
<P>A few Things under this Head,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>As to the Money Medium</HI> [to what has been fairly &s;ail, I may here further a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d] <HI>It &s;eems alto|gether in vain for us to expect it, or make any Pro|jections Concerning it.</HI> Were it a better Medium of Trade then really it is, we have not the matter of it in our own Country and our pre&s;ent Capacity denies us of it. And moreover, all Countries Generally com|plain of the &s;carcity of this Specie; as <HI>Sweedland, Germany, France,</HI> &amp;c. nay <HI>Spain</HI> it &s;elf, who is the Proprietor of the Mines in <HI>Mexico,</HI> and <HI>Peru?</HI> That what can we expect will fall to our Share? Indeed we have no Rea&s;on to be overfond of it; for, when we had it, it was never &s;ufficient in a due Degree, to Support the Government, and carry on the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Country, but at a very Poor and Pitiful Rate. That it &s;eems to me as tho' we had lo&s;t one half of our time for want of a &s;ufficient Medium: For where Men have Done Well, they might have Done much Better, and where as we have been fain to Creep, we

might have Run in Bu&s;ine&s;s, and advanced our Coun|try double in the time to what it is; had we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a full Medium.

<P N="2">2. <HI>If there be any Help for us, our Relief is by a Bank of Credit.</HI> The Paper Medium, is the Medium which we mu&s;t depend upon.

very proper Means. Sir</HI> Edward Cook <HI>that great Statesman and Oracle, allows the Bills to be very proper in a time of War.</HI></P>
<P>An&s;. <HI>If they are proper in War, why not in Peace?</HI> Indeed, it is an old Saying and a true one, Scil. <HI>Money is the Sinews of War.</HI> And if it be why not al&s;o in Peace? For I dont &s;ee how a People or Body Politick can well hang together without &s;uch Sinews in Peace any more than in War. For the meaning is, that Money which An&s;wers all things, is to Support, Carry on and Defray all Charges; and if a People have a full Supply of it, then they are &s;trong, and have good Si|news, Ligaments, Bones and what not to carry their Load, and go on with their Duty. And certainly, that Medium which will enable them in their Duty in War, will be of Equal Advantage in time of Peace. Which may be more evident if we di&s;tingui&s;h between a Country that has a Sufficient Stock of Money as a Medium of Trade in time of Peace, (Sir <HI>Edward Cokes</HI> Ca&s;e) but not &s;o plentiful as to &s;upply all the Emergen|cies of War; therefore the Bills may be prudently made u&s;e of in &s;uch a Ca&s;e to enlarge their Stock. Now we mu&s;t under&s;tand, that the Ca&s;e is very different with a Country which has no Money at all: for if the Bills will &s;uit and relieve the former in a time of War, they mu&s;t needs be a very good Medium for the latter, both in the time of Peace as well as in War. Unle&s;s you will be &s;o Ra&s;h as to &s;uppo&s;e a Country may do without any Medium at all in time of Peace; if they can have one in War: which to &s;uppo&s;e is contrary to the &s;uffrage of Mankind. Therefore as the Bills have Relieved us, &s;o eminently in War, we may rationally depend upon them in times of Peace, &s;eeing our <HI>Money</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> all gone, and not like|ly to return, unle&s;s our Merchants will fetch it back for us.</P>

with the Wor&s;hip of God, and of Immen&s;e Benefit to the Crown. In our pre&s;ent Settlements, we are but like the Lift on the Cloth; whenas in an Age or Two more (with an ordinary Ble&s;&s;ing) we might more than double our Country, in Number of Towns, and People; and the incouragement which may be given by the Bills of Credit (in the pre&s;ent Juncture of Affairs in the Chri&s;tian World) will certainly forward the De&s;ign abundantly.</P>
<P>For &s;uppo&s;e we admit of this Projection. That a Range of Town&s;hips, from River to River, Four Mile Square (according to the view of our late Gentlemen) and 50 or 60 Heads of Families joyning for a Society, &amp;c. to &s;ettle within three Years, &amp;c. and that every Ma&s;ter of a Family Adventuring to &s;upport him in his Undertaking, in Building, Clearing of Ground, Buying Servants, Stock, or other ways, &amp;c. they and each one &s;o Chu&s;ing &s;hall take one Hundred, or one Hundred and Fifty Pound out of the Bank, upon Rea|&s;onable Security; and &s;hall have it Ten Years Rent free, and then Repay it, &amp;c. I do pre&s;ume by the&s;e means we may Subdue and Settle tho&s;e De&s;olate Lands with very good and Effective Men: and if done each Town would be Worth more than <HI>Ten Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> to the Publick, at the Expiration of the Term. And on other Con&s;iderations it would much Advance our Country.</P>
<P>For then tho&s;e Woods and Swamps which are now Impregnable Forts and Ramparts for a Naked Skulk|ing Enemy, and renders them invincible, when once brought under Culture (and now or never) will be &s;omewhat like the Wall of <HI>China,</HI> which is a Barrier to that Empire, again&s;t the <HI>Tartars;</HI> or that in <HI>Bri|tain,</HI> Erected by the Romans, to cover their Conque&s;t, again&s;t the <HI>Picts.</HI> So would this be to us in &s;ome mea&s;ure, again&s;t a like Enemy.</P>
<P>And then we may go on with great Encouragement,

And to pretend to Manufactures, without a great Overplus
<PB N="27" REF="002311_0030_0FDB1F31A97BCFE0">
(to our Husbandry) in our Number of People, is but to talk Chymaerus. And tho' now in our pre&s;ent Ca|pacity, all good Hou&s;holders do what they can, for Ordinary wear for a Family, to rub along with thro' much hard Labour, and Cold Winters; and &s;o in the Run of the Year we, after a Fa&s;hion, make up our Produce of Wool, &amp;c. But this is nothing like Ma|nufacturing the Effects of a large Country for a Foreign Vend.

<P>This is very obvious, our Country, tho' of a pretty Au&s;tere Climate, yet if well and effectually managed, is capable of a Self-Sub&s;i&s;tence, as fully as mo&s;t Coun|tries in the World. If I am not mi&s;informed, or mi&s;taken, the Juice of many of our Sweet Trees, and the Fruit of others, will yield a Generous Sugar. And if we cant well do with our Cyder, or without Wine, why may we not Cultivate the French Grape; we being many Degrees nearer the Sun than they. But if not, our Bees can do great Feats, if rightly managed, in producing a Generous Nectar, equal with the be&s;t of Wines in &s;trength and healthfulne&s;s. Al&s;o our Soil yields plenty of Corn, &amp;c. Feeds and Breeds all &s;orts of Cattle, &amp;c. and is very natural in its productions

And al&s;o the Iron Mine, but this does u&s;ually eat up its Owners for want of Hands; and &s;o will all the Re&s;t of our Manufactures do, as has been &s;aid. Therefore the Bu&s;ine&s;s of our pre&s;ent Age is to incourage a Foreign Trade; and give it all the Support and Advantage we are Capable of; for mo&s;t certainly with help of &s;uch a Medium, and in &s;uch Plenty, as by it we can ea&s;ily Vend and Circulate our own pre&s;ent Produce and Effects; we can then Buy of our Merchants many nece&s;&s;ary as well as convenient Things, cheaper than we can po&s;&s;ible make them, and &s;o &s;ave our Time by the Bargain, for other and more profitable Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Al&s;o it is, and will be much for our Service to Rein|force our pre&s;ent Husbandry, &s;o far as it &s;preads; Let the Farmer have all Due Incouragement, as before, &amp;c.

And tho' it is al&s;o certain when Men had Clipt the Money down to Fifteen-penny weight, Bills fell al&s;o to that value in ordinary Trade; yet this informs us that the Bills were &s;till held equal with Money: but after the Money and Bills had with equal Currency pa&s;t at that rate for &s;ome Years; &s;ome particular Men who had Bonds for Lawful Money again&s;t their Neigh|bours would refu&s;e the Bills unle&s;s Two &amp; eight pence upon the Bills were added to make them full Seven|teen

And again, When the Money was more drained out of the Coun|try, and grown more &s;carce, then &s;ome particular Creditors (tho' not all) demanded Two Shillings more to be added to the Bills to make them compleatly the Silver Specie.

<P>But moreover, the Bills &s;eem to have lo&s;t a Point in their Reputation by certain Emergencies, that have not been &s;o well ob&s;erved; or &s;ome Ca&s;ualties which happened, before or about the time when they grew more plentiful. As for In&s;tance, The Briti&s;h Fleet was &s;ome Means of Rai&s;ing the Price of our live Stock, there was al&s;o in &s;ome of the late Years, a con&s;iderable &s;carcity of &s;alt Provi&s;ions, for the &s;upport of the Fi&s;h|ery, and of Shipping, for that Pork was not imported &s;o plentifully as at other Times. And al&s;o there was a great re&s;ort of Foreign Ships of Trade, that whil&s;t here, mainly Victualled with our fre&s;h provi&s;ions: And our Fi&s;hery al&s;o &s;upplied it &s;elf from a Weekly Slaughter in a great Mea&s;ure: So that all Prov&s;ions grew to a great height, to what they had been, and made it &s;eem as tho' the fault had been in the Bills; when as under &s;uch Circum&s;tances, if we had had our Silver in equal Proportions, as ordinarily; there would have been po&s;&s;ibly no great odds in Prices; and that becau&s;e of the pre&s;ent Scarcity &amp; large Vend. Whence it mu&s;t needs be great Weakne&s;s in any to infer the in&s;ufficiency of the Bills from what has pa&s;t hitherto; for if they do they are very weak Logicians, or el&s;e have mi&s;t of the True Premi&s;es, as has been now Recited.</P>

Times have been, yet the Bills have done all the Bu&s;ine&s;s of our Country, they were Ordained for.</HI> And al&s;o tho' many hard Demands were made upon them on the account of Money Obligations, yet it was far better to the Debtor, than to have paid the Spe|cie Indented for; becau&s;e the Bills were to be had upon Rea&s;onable Terms, but the Money was not; it being almo&s;t quite gone out of the Country; and had left many Men under heavy Bonds, (&s;o &s;ickle is it in its own nature) which the Bills by their Currency Re|lieved, tho' with &s;uch an Allowance.

all Trade, Debts and Obligations upon their Cre|dit, and a pre&s;umption of their continuance; which &s;ignifies the high E&s;teem and Value which we have for them; and in that we have no other Medium to depend upon, this will be as high in E&s;timation, as Men in Ju&s;tice and Rea&s;on can expect. For,</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>All Men of Sen&s;e and Humanity (but &s;uch who Love them&s;elves more than all Mankind be&s;ides) will allow, That it is too hard a Fate for Men of good Conduct to &s;pend their Days in Rolling the Stone of Si&s;yphus: But that by their Frugality and Painful Improvement of the Means of their Sub|&s;i&s;tence, they ought to make a clear Gain, as being most agreeable with the Law of God and Nature.</HI> And if our Bills will admit of this, as a Medium of Trade, as well or Better than Money: And when they are at &s;uch a Pitch and Degree, as to accompli&s;h this end: We may then ju&s;tly affirm, that they are in our Ca&s;e equal or Superiour to Money. For if they will do all the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and keep us thriving, will not this be as good as Money? Yea, I am very &s;ure it will, and better too: For that the Money Medium has been the Means of our Oppre&s;&s;ion, rather than of our Flouri&s;hing State, as has been &s;aid. It is not a little Sprinkling of Money, which is always upon the Wing, or Bobbing up and down like <HI>Tantalus</HI> his Apples, that will make a Country Rich. But it is Diligence, Frugality; and the Circulation of the Pro|duce, with a clear Gain and Profit to every Man, whereby he is fully Recompenced for the u&s;e of his Prime Stock; for his Labour, and the Ri&s;que which he runs: But I am very well per&s;waded, Money has never done this as a Medium in <HI>New-England;</HI> nor nothing near it: E&s;pecially as to Farmers, and Hus|bandmen, which is the great Studd &amp; Strength of our Country: Therefore abundance if not gone behind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">and, have &s;tood it a &s;tay; or with all their hard La|bour,

and hard Fare, have turned like the Door on the Hinge, as tho' Sluggards, whenas the Fault has been in the Medium of Trace, on which they have depended, Scil. <HI>In the Money Times.</HI> This &s;eems very plain in many, but I &s;hall con&s;ider it but in one Example, viz. <HI>In Neat Cattle.</HI></P>
<P>And here let us imagine, how long, and cold our Winters are; and what care, time, hou&s;ing and fod|der mu&s;t be imployed, and &s;pent upon a Stock of Cat|tle, to Rai&s;e, Feed, and fit them for the Market, &amp;c. Now can any Rational Man [that knows any thing of this Affair] Judge it agreeable with any Points of Equity, the Rules of Fellow&s;hip, and profit; for Men to &s;ell their Cattle, as they have been Con&s;trained to do, in the Money Times. <HI>Scil.</HI> Five or Six Pounds for a Yoke of Oxen when Lean; or for Six or Seven Pounds when Fat? And as for tho&s;e which have al|ways Lay'n upon charge till they have come to the Market, <HI>viz.</HI> young Cattle coming four; the&s;e have commonly been Sold at Thirty or Forty Shillings per Head, which has not made out near the Prime Co&s;t. And if &s;o this is but little better then taking their La|bour, for their Pains; which is Certainly a very poor Method for Farmers to grow Rich by.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>Gentlemen!</HI> If the Bills have been the Far|mers Re&s;cue by ea&s;ing &s;uch Points, &amp;c. then tho' they dont come up to the Rigorous Value, and Price of Money, when it was a meer Etxtortioner, or but little better than a common Robber: Yet if they bring things nearer to the Rule of Equity; and Adju&s;t mat|ters in Commerce &s;o fairly, that all Men may live and thrive, upon their Labour and Profits; this is to bring the Bills to &s;uch a Level, as the Money ought to be at in a Country of Trade, and Religion, whete Men &s;hould love their Neighbours as them&s;elves; and do as they would be done by; and therefore &s;hould be Willing, that others &s;hould live Pro&s;perou&s;ly upon
<PB N="35" REF="002311_0038_0FDB1F467338A7D8">
their Means, their Incomes, Labour, and Profits, as well as them&s;elves. And when it is thus in a Coun|try; and thro' Mercy it has thus happened with us under the Government of our Bills: Now from what has been &s;aid, the Con&s;equence is not that the Bills are fallen below the ju&s;t value of Money; but the meaning of it is, that our Native produce is Ri&s;en, and brought up to a due Value, or E&s;timation, by the Improvement of the Bills; which ought to be appro|ved by all good Chri&s;tians, and Common Wealthsmen. And this may be further &s;upported by the Judicious. Opinion of Sir <HI>Edward Coke</HI> in his Tenure by Rents, [and indeed in &s;ome &s;en&s;e all our Lands are Rent Te|nure-Lands; as we owe and mu&s;t pay for them an An|nual Income to Church and State] Therefore [ac|cording to Sir <HI>Edward</HI>] If Trade and Commerce be maintained, &s;o that our Native Commodities, and Produce of our Country, which are Rich, Nece&s;&s;ary, and Co&s;tly Things; without which we cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;ub&s;i&s;t; If the&s;e be holden up at a good Rate; and be kept &s;alable at &s;uch a Value, that the Labourer and Farmer may make a clear Profit by them, then may Tenants do their Duty to their Landlords the better; and they them&s;elves live like Men.</P>
<P>Object. <HI>But does not this hurt all Salary Men by keeping up the Prices of our own Produce?</HI></P>
<P>An&s;wer 1. <HI>The Country has by the Money Medium, and the Indians, been kept, near Fourty Years in low Circum&s;tances, to what they might have attained to, if they had had better Neighbours, and a better Medi|um of Trade.</HI> And many Precincts have been &s;et off, &amp;c. Such Things have without Doubt kept the Salary at a lower Ebb, &amp;c. But how&s;oever,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>As the Money was to blame for &s;etting the Sa|laries &s;o low in the time of its Government; &s;o let the Salaries now Ri&s;e proportionably by the good Fortune of the Bills; then none can complains of ill

<P N="5">5. <HI>As we are in this pre&s;ent attempt, trying whe|ther we cant find that the Bills are truly and ju&s;tly par with Money; &s;o we &s;et the Scales even, and weigh Right without doubt we &s;hall.</HI> And for this end, or in computing the true Value of the Bills we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h. (1) Between a full Stock of Money, and no Money at all, or that which is next to none. And this you will find to make a great odds in the Ca&s;e. For if there be no Money, or that which is next to none in our Country; &amp; we infer that the Bills are of no Value, be|cau&s;e they wont purcha&s;e Money; or really are of no more Value, but only of &s;o much as they will in Fact procure in Money; this is a very corrupt and fallacious Method, in adju&s;ting between Money &amp; the Bills. Yet &s;o far as I can perceive, this is accounted, the Crime, and Ground of Proce&s;s again&s;t the Bills. That is to &s;ay, becau&s;e the Bills will not now purcha&s;e Shilling for Shilling and Pound for Pound, in good Dry Money, Pieces of Eight, at Seventeen-penny-half-penny-weight, <HI>Therefore the Sentence is pa&s;t, that they mu&s;t be Burnt, as tho' they were State Here|ticks;</HI> whenas there is not a Shilling to be &s;een or heard of in ordinary Commerce or Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Gentlemen!</HI> By this kind of Judicature you may Indict Gold and Silver for In&s;ignificant Fools; or empty Cyphers, in the Affairs of Mankind; and affirm that this Silver Money has quite lo&s;t its Value, and is become good for nothing. For that the time was a Man may &s;ay, that I could have bought good Wheat at <HI>Four Shillings</HI> in Money per Bu&s;hel, and now its all gone out of Town and Country; that if I would give <HI>Forty Shillings</HI> for a Peck I can't get it. Oh this Silver Money is worth nothing at all. Now, <HI>Gentlemen!</HI> This is the great, meritorious, and

Their Bills of Publick Credit have been exceeding &s;er|viceable in &s;upporting their Worldly Affairs: And yet po&s;&s;ibly, for &s;ome &s;cores, if not for &s;ome hundreds of Years, have not kept one Ducket in their Publick Trea&s;ury to keep up the Credit of them.</P>
<P>Take the following account from a Credible Au|thor&punc; relating to this Affair, viz.</P>
<P>Bills wherever Banks have been erected (tho' Mo|ney Banks) always have been of better Value than Money in Specie.</P>
<P>Whereof three Rea&s;ons may be given.</P>

<P N="2">2. Rea&s;on. <HI>For Safety in Travelling, Laying up, &amp;c. as vi&s;ible as the other.</HI></P>

<P>The An&s;wer is ea&s;y: <HI>viz.</HI> The State of <HI>Venice</HI> had made u&s;e of the Monies Depo&s;ited, in their Publick Occa&s;ions, (where ob&s;erve the Hazard of a Money Bank,) and having promi&s;ed for Satisfaction of Cre|ditors, to rai&s;e the like Sum, if they &s;hould have occa&s;ion for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, they Reap this Advantage of their Peoples high Opinion of the Bills, that they are thereby a&s;&s;ured, that never will any Creditor come to ask them a 100 <ABBR>l</ABBR> for a Bill of a 100 <ABBR>l</ABBR> when he may have a 120 <ABBR>l</ABBR> from

<P>Now <HI>Gentlemen!</HI> Let me Pray you, with Sedate|ne&s;s of Thought to peru&s;e and think over the&s;e No|ble and Famous Examples, in the Affairs and Wi&s;e Managements of Civil States.</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>Con&s;ider Per&s;ons; And I cannot think, but you will allow, &s;o far as Imagination is nece&s;&s;ary in rai&s;|ing the Glory, and value of a thing, the People of this Province are as capable as any other:</HI> For that certainly we carry as much of the <HI>Lapis Aurificus,</HI> or <HI>Philo&s;ophers Stone</HI> in our heads, and can turn other matter into Silver or Gold by the Power of thought as &s;oon as any other People, or el&s;e I mu&s;t own I have not yet Learnt the Character of my Country.

For that our Bills are upon a Land fund, or &s;ecurity, and the Publick faith to De|fend it; and the Government to manage it, to regu|late, and &s;ee that every thing &s;hall be done in the i&s;&s;ue and termination, as becomes a wi&s;e Government.

<P N="3">3. <HI>As to Effects, Con&s;equents, Concomitants, &amp;c.</HI> They are very numerous, in every State relating to this Subject; and in Times, Places and Examples very Dif|fering, &amp;c.</P>
<P>As to our own Concerns, to pa&s;s all other Remarks, this is an attendant on our State, &amp;c. <HI>viz.</HI> A Medi|um of Trade it mu&s;t be had, its indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;a|ry; our Money, that little we had is gone; we have had long Experience of the u&s;efulne&s;s and profit of the Paper Medium; as has been &s;aid: It does all our Bu&s;ine&s;s, hurts no Man, but ble&s;&s;es all Men (but what is purely Accidental, &amp;c.)

<P>We have po&s;&s;ibly from the fir&s;t Projection Exhibited half a Million in Bills of Credit: It is a mighty E&s;tate, and acquired with little or no Co&s;t.

Run it into Coin, at about <HI>Fifty Shillings</HI> per Thou|&s;and Pound.

<HEAD>II. QUESTION.</HEAD>
<P>WE now come to Examine into the Second Grand Que&s;tion. Scil. By whom may a BANK OF CREDIT be managed, mo&s;t to the Advantage of this Province?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer,</HI> The An&s;wer is in Two Parts.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="part">
<P N="1">1 Part, <HI>Relates to the Publick.</HI> It is very appa|rent, that tho&s;e who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ave had the Management of the Bank hitherto, have done it well They have in their great Wi&s;dom &s;aved and &s;upported their Coun|try; and why &s;hould any M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n meditate a new Mi|ni&s;try, for this Great Tru&s;t? For that there be very forcible Rea&s;ons why the Country and Government, &s;hould keep it in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wn Hands. As, (1) It is agreable with the Examples of other Wi&s;e Govern|ments; who for their Wi&s;dom, Conduct, and Succe&s;s are worthy of our Imitation; as <HI>Holland, Venice, New-York, &amp;c.</HI> Tho' its true, <HI>(Exempla Illu&s;trant, Quamvi, non Re&s;tringunt.)</HI> &s;uch things informs us, but do not always bind us, &amp;c. (2) The Profit ac|cruing by a Loan Bank &s;eems mo&s;t rea&s;onable it &s;hould
<PB N="47" REF="002311_0050_0FDB1F621D2B7BC8">
be to the Publick; thereby every one has a proporti|onable &s;hare of the Income. (3) Where Money (as in our Ca&s;e) is not to be had, to Support the Govern|ment; the Government mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity, Annually Emit &s;uch a Number of Bills, as will An&s;wer the Publick Charge, both in Peace and War. For to do it by the Corn, and Provi&s;ion Specie, it will &s;oon be found intollerable: For that when the Bills are E|mitted and Circulate, it will be an ea&s;e to Officers, and al&s;o to the People, &amp;c. for every Man may pay his A&s;&s;e&s;sment, as he &s;its in his Chair; he need never Tackel up his Team to tran&s;port his Burthen&s;ome Loads to the Seat of Government; and when it comes there, po&s;&s;ibly it mu&s;t lye, and fat the Rats and Mice, whil&s;t it waits for a Market, &amp;c. Now under this Pre&s;umption that the Government will think it be&s;t to keep our Bills in their own proper Bu&s;ine&s;s; if a Bank be Erected by Private Gentlemen, this will occa|&s;ion various &s;orts of Money in our Country, and this may be as the Cholick in our Bowels; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r occa&s;ion many Inconveniencies in ours Affairs: And therefore it &s;eems far Be&s;t for the Publick to hold all in their own hands. (4) A Loan Bank Erected by the Coun|try, as ours at pre&s;ent is; it mu&s;t always be founded and Supported by the Lands of particular Gentlemen, and in this &s;en&s;e, it is really and truly a Private Bank, both as to the Matter, and the Per&s;ons involved. And tho&s;e Men who run that venture, and thereby di&s;|per&s;e the whole Fund, for the Advance of the Pub|lick Trade, as well as for their own Profit, mu&s;t needs be e&s;teemed great Benefactors to the Publick; and to treat them with any thing that looks like Surprize, or Tricking, will not be Honourable, nor agreeable with Wi&s;dom, if any mi&s;chance &s;hould happen, &amp;c. This is to &s;ignify that the&s;e are the Men that lye at Stake, and are only in hazard. For tho&s;e who take the Bills in the Circulation of them, have the Publick Faith to re&s;t
<PB N="48" REF="002311_0051_0FDB1F651F82BDF0">
upon, and the Authority of the Government; which have taken &s;ufficient Pawns for Security in the Land-Depo&s;ited, &amp;c. So that the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> are &s;ecure and out of Danger. Yet al&s;o in the manage|ment of the Projection in this way, con&s;idering the Temper, Wi&s;dom and Power of the Mini&s;try which has the Care of the Bank, viz. <HI>The Government:</HI> they will better Umpire all C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;es, and do every thing that is Equal, Right, and full of Clemency to the Bankers, who are mo&s;t in danger, as well as &s;ee Ju&s;tice done to other Men, &amp;c. Whenas po&s;&s;ibly a Private Bank (properly &s;o con&s;idered) may not be &s;o &s;afe on all &s;ides: There may be more danger of Partiality, Collu&s;ions, Fraud, and thereby plunging or &s;napping Mens E&s;tates, put into a Private Bank, upon &s;ome In|nuendo's, Niceties, or Punctilio's in Law, at lea&s;t it may &s;eem &s;o to &s;ome, &amp;c. That upon a Pre&s;umption that the Publick &s;hall think meet to continue the Bank under their own Management; it mu&s;t needs be al|lowed by all to be, and remain in very Good, nay in the Be&s;t of Hands. But yet,</P>

<P>AS to a Private Bank (peculiarly &s;o con&s;idered) there be very good rea&s;ons to be given why a particular Company or &s;uitable Gentlemen, &s;hould be Intru&s;ted with &s;uch a Grand Affair for the &s;ervice of a Country. (<HI>Scil.</HI> Under the In&s;pection of the Go|vernment, &amp;c.) That is to &s;ay, In our Ca&s;e, if our Country and Government find their own Rank (as to their Apprehen&s;ion, &amp;c.) is fateagued, with &s;ome &s;uch incumberments, and incon&s;i&s;tences, that they nei|ther can, nor will di&s;pence with. As to In&s;tance, fir&s;t in the lo&s;s of the Money, they cant bear it, but will try for the Recovering of it, &amp;c. And al&s;o, as to the value of the Bills they will not be contented to
<PB N="49" REF="002311_0052_0FDB1F6521A45DA0">
&s;et down with the deci&s;ion that common Trade, and Commerce has hitherto made on this Point, For &s;ays abundance of Men (and may be very wi&s;e Men tool) let every Body &s;ay what they will, and with their fine flouri&s;hes Paliate the matter: Yet its Plain enough, the Money has been two hard for the Bills, and apparently has made a Fool of them: And tho' the Bills have kept the Hou&s;e; and the Money is gone from home; as tho' it had been turned out of Doors for a wrangler; yet the Bills have not done their Office fully, or played their part as was intend|ed: And they are &s;o qualified in their own Nature; and &s;o &s;oft and apt to warp, that no Government can &s;o &s;tiffen them, but when all is &s;aid and done as can be, they will remain, but a leaden rule in mea&s;uring Exchanges, &amp;c. And therefore the Country is re&s;ol|ved to call in all out-&s;tanding Bills, and in convenient time di&s;&s;olve their Bank; and try for the Money Me|dium; for that there be abundance of Men, that have the&s;e Idea's, <HI>Scil.</HI> Let the Bills be all Burn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; and the Money will come. Now, if we are reduced to &s;uch a notion of things; and to &s;uch a Re&s;olution; there is then, apparently very great, and &s;trong Pleas, why a particular Company of Gentlemen &s;hould erect a Bank of Credit; for that it is very plain, upon the fore&s;aid Hypothe&s;is, &s;uch a Projection will no ways hinder, but help and bring to Birth the fore&s;aid Re&s;o|lutions and hopes; but to throw up the pre&s;ent Fund, and leave all our Affairs open to chance and hap-haz|zard; without &s;ub&s;tituting another for the &s;ake of a Me|dium, will be to murder our Temporal Bu&s;ine&s;s; and at once undo our &s;elves. So that if the Country is quite heart &s;ick with their own mea&s;ures; I am very well a&s;&s;ured, upon a very good Argument, that a Pri+vate Bank &s;hall cure them, and do every thing to their Satisfaction. I &s;hall with all convenient Brevity, of|fer a few Preliminary Thoughts Relating to the pre|&s;ent
<PB N="50" REF="002311_0053_0FDB1F6524B56E30">
Subject; and then point at Per&s;ons proper to be intru&s;ted with the Affair; and the Rea&s;ons of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. A Few preliminary Thoughts, wherein I &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h between a Publick and Private Bank. Viz. <HI>Imprimis, A Publick Bank of Credit, as &s;omewhat Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us; yet it carries a va&s;t Bounty with it to tho&s;e Countries who h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve the Wi&s;dom to give it an Honourable Reception: But to others it is but a Common Plague.</HI> There be Two Principles ab&s;olutely needful to pre&s;erve it in a Country, viz. Prudence, and a Publick Spirit in Head Men of E&s;tates; if &s;uch Men will but wi&s;ely govern their Private Intere&s;ts in favor of it; they will &s;oon &s;hackle other Mens; and Bridle their Recu&s;ancy, and bring them to confor|mity. A Wi&s;e Government may Project, but it is Wi&s;e and Great Men under Government, that mu&s;t Cultivate &s;uch a Projection, for a Publick Good. Therefore where the Principal Men of E&s;tates and Trade will become Patrons, (tho' not per&s;onally in|volved) this will &s;upport it. I do imagine the for|mal Rea&s;on not of the Being, but of the Pro&s;perous and Flouri&s;hing State, of tho&s;e Famous Banks (that have been mentioned) owe for their Glory, to this Temper of Mind, in the Principal Gentlemen of the &s;everal Countries, where they were Erected.</P>
<P>That is thus. At the fir&s;t Commencement and O|pening of tho&s;e Funds, we mu&s;t imagine, the&s;e Men payed a great Veneration to the Bills: And there be|ing a Trade going forward, peculiarly under their Management; and al&s;o many Credits, and Bonds for Lawful Money, again&s;t other Men, &amp;c. It was after this manner, &amp;c. [1] As to their Trade, when Men come to buy a Supply with the Bills; they accommo|date them at the Old Money Price, and take the Bills without Higling or making any di&s;tinction, &amp;c. And (2.) As to their Bonds, and Obligations for Special|ties,
<PB N="51" REF="002311_0054_0FDB1F6526EE1C38">
when the Debtor comes; po&s;&s;ibly he inquires. Sir! there is a Bond of <HI>One Thou&s;and Duckets</HI> in your hands again&s;t me, will you take Bank Bills? Re|ply, <HI>Bank Bills Man!</HI> There's nothing will &s;uit me better than Bank Bills: For I mu&s;t tell you, I have that high Opinion of the Bills, that I will abate part of my Intere&s;t, if you will clear the re&s;t, and the whole Principal by the Bills. I do a&s;&s;ure you my good Friend, and you may tell it to all your Neighbours, that we in the Merchandize do prefer the Bills above the Mo|ney, &amp;c. Now &s;uch a prudent Temper Circulating, and Influencing the Principal Members of &s;uch a Grand Community, will &s;oon become a Law for all other Men, &amp;c. Thus it has been in <HI>Holland, Venice, New-York, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But on the other hand, Where the Bills <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ve gone up and down and been Ridiculed. Its owing to head Men and Men of Fortune, <HI>Avice Ver&s;a,</HI> &amp;c. In <HI>France, Sweedland, and South-Carolina,</HI> &amp;c. Now, it &s;eems to me plain that if tho&s;e Civil powers or States that have &s;tood and look't on and &s;een their Noble Projections for the Advance of Trade trampled upon, and could not po&s;&s;ibly prevent the Pro&s;titution, if they had (I &s;ay) when they di&s;cerned things lap|&s;ing into &s;uch Confu&s;ion, Re&s;igned the Management of the Bank to principle &amp; &s;uitable Gentlemen, or turned their publick into a private Bank; they might have ea&s;ily Recovered the Glory and Sufficiency of their Bank, &amp;c. E&s;pecially if &s;upporting and Reinforcing the Beque&s;tment with due Sanctions. As, (1.) That the profit, &s;hall be fixed in the Tru&s;tees, &amp;c. (2.) That the Government in&s;pect, &amp;c. (3.) That the Bills &s;hall be held as Current and Lawful Money, in an&s;wering all A&s;&s;e&s;ments, and al&s;o in di&s;charging all Creditors, to the Publick, as their own Bills, &amp;c. And tho' in this Method, the &s;en&s;ible profit &s;eems a Booty

to &s;ome particular Men; but the General Good by keeping up a valuable Medium for all Bu&s;ine&s;s, is as equally beneficial to all Men in common, as tho' done by the Government.

<P>A Convenient Company of &s;uch Men imbodied by a Charter from the Government, &amp;c. may Manage a Bank of Credit, as matters may be Circum&s;tanced, bet|ter than the Publick Government; <HI>viz.</HI> when things are out of Joynt, as in <HI>France,</HI> &amp;c. and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s &s;ome think in our own Ca&s;e in &s;ome degree, as has been &s;aid, &amp;c.

&s;o al&s;o is their Ri&s;que: There is a &s;ort of Wi&s;e and very Prudent Men, that are a kind of <HI>Amphibians</HI> beings who live in both Elements, Land and Water, the&s;e are Eminently Qualified, as Members for a Pri|vate Bank. And al&s;o Rich Farmers, and Mechannicks, Men of Character, and Influence (according to their Sphere) in the Places where they live. The main of the&s;e Men mu&s;t belong to our <HI>Metropolis,</HI> and other Sea-Ports and Towns of Trade, and others to be di&s;|per&s;ed thro' the Province. A Convenient Company of &s;uch Per&s;ons &s;o Qualified, and Incorporated, I do Imagine, &s;hall be capable to carry on a Bank of Cre|dit with greate&s;t Advantage, with an Immen&s;e good and Benefit to the Publick. For new being intru&s;ted by the Government with the Outward happine&s;s, well|being, and flouri&s;hing State of their Country; being al&s;o in&s;tituted, not meerly for their own Private In|tere&s;t; but to promote the Publick Good, they mu&s;t needs act in &s;uch a Sphere in &s;ome proportion like the Government it &s;elf; as being now become Publick Benefactors, and Common Fathers to their Country; and being Men of Noble and Great minds; mu&s;t and will con&s;ult the Good of other Men, as well as their own. And that &s;uch a Community are capable of doing great Service in this Affair, is obvious from the following Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Rea&s;ons are,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Rea&s;on.</HI> For that this Company of Gentlemen can Regulate the Prices of all Things Yearly in the common cour&s;e of Trade, and Commerce. The wild and in&s;ulting Prices of Things have ruined the Foreign Banks, &amp;c. And po&s;&s;ibly &s;omething of this Nature has been a Deminution to our own, &amp;c. Now there is a &s;overeign Remedy provided in this Projection, again&s;t &s;uch an inconveniency, and mi&s;chief. For by the Wi&s;dom, Precautions, Example of the&s;e Men, they
<PB N="54" REF="002311_0057_0FDB1F70DD0A20B8">
will thereby conduct all &s;uch Points, as tho' Control|lers and ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olute Ma&s;ters of the Market, and yet hurt no Mans Property, or Infringe Liberty; and hereby Equity in Commerce will be better upheld; Exce&s;&s;ive Demands &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; the Honour and Credit of the Medium maintained; And the Ju&s;t and Rea&s;ona|ble gains and profits of all Men &s;uited and &s;ecured. For we mu&s;t further note, that they are Men of dif|fering Functions, and their own Intere&s;ts, as well as Honour, Wi&s;dom and Hone&s;ty, will oblige them always to &s;teer right, and do well for other Men; for if they hurt others, they hurt them&s;elves. And no Man need &s;u&s;pect or fear, no not a Knave, much le&s;s a wi&s;e and hone&s;t Man under this head. For that it is a very &s;ure Maxim, viz. <HI>Self Intere&s;t will neither Cheat or Lye: For that this is the String in the No&s;e (thro' the World) which governs the Creature.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Rea&s;on.</HI> For that this Projection will both keep up the Value, and al&s;o the Circulation of the Bills; and in a great Mea&s;ure prevent hoarding for the future, and correct it at the pre&s;ent. I am not &s;o &s;een into the Capacity, State, Produce, Trade, and Bu&s;ine&s;s of my Country, as to be Peremtory; yet do imagine, that our Medium at this Day, as to our out&s;tanding Bills, is not near Sufficient for the whole Trade of this Country, and a great part of them, po&s;&s;ibly is con|fined. Some Men it is very probable, do according to their U&s;age, their Income, and Trade, Annually yield|ing a con&s;iderable Surplu&s;age, to what they have oc|ca&s;ion to pa&s;s away (Lay it up) till Opportunity pre|&s;ents to Let it out at Intere&s;t, &amp;c. This &s;eems to make &s;ome &s;top, or divert the common &s;tream. But many others (as &s;ome Men Jealous) keep clo&s;e what they can lay Hands on, for a peculiar Market. And its well if more then one Third of our Supply and pre&s;ent Stock is not &s;topt by this means, like Stagnate Waters,
<PB N="55" REF="002311_0058_0FDB1F736A7C24F8">
in Pits and Mud-holes. And I doubt there be a great many Men, &s;ubtile in Bu&s;ine&s;s, who by their Politick Mea&s;ures, make Goods do, when they &s;hould rather pa&s;s away Bills, that they may keep Circulating, &amp;c. But however when the Principal Men of our Country, &s;hall be involved in the management above&s;aid, &s;uch things will in likelihood be &s;olved, &amp;c. and &s;o the Common Fountain will, as indeed it &s;hould, always move and Circulate, like the Main Ocean. This great Body was Ordained, to &s;upply the Earth with Showers; with Rivers, and &s;maller Streams, for the &s;atisfying the Thir&s;t, and nouri&s;hment of every living Thing: Even the Plants, Birds and Worms, are &s;up|ported by its Bounty; and then the Tributary Clouds, and Springs repay them&s;elves to the Seas. So it &s;hould be in our Ca&s;e, and the means propo&s;ed, carries &s;uch a pro&s;pect with it, that the future, and al&s;o the pre&s;ent State of things for Hoards, will &s;oon di&s;&s;olve upon &s;uch an in&s;titution, or &s;urrender.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Rea&s;on.</HI> From the Capacity that many Hun|dreds of the Kings very Good and Loyal Subjects are reduced to, in their Temporal Affairs, upon a confi|dence in the Paper Medium, and the Continuation of it; <HI>That to Suppre&s;s it will be attend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d with many Grievances.</HI> Therefore Quaere, <HI>Whether the Mouth of Aeolus his Cave, is not here or hereabouts?</HI> And tho' it be, the Projection offered, will certainly &s;hut, and bolt the Door, and Divert all that is portentous from that Quarter.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Rea&s;on.</HI> Finally, For that this Projection will be a Remedy, for that which many Men grown under as our greate&s;t Misfortune; unle&s;s the Ca&s;e is ab&s;olute|ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;perate; and if &s;o, all Men mu&s;t be Re&s;igned: but otherways, this is the only, and proper Method, to fetch home our Money; and to keep it when we
<PB N="56" REF="002311_0059_0FDB1F7547E47A30">
hive got it: And this you &s;uppo&s;e will help all Ca&s;es. I &s;ay if it be practicable, or within the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of ho|ne&s;t Men's Art, and Wi&s;dom to recover the <HI>Silver</HI> or the u&s;e of this Province, this is the way to do it. For hereby your Merchants, and mo&s;t Potent Men in &s;uch Bu&s;ine&s;s, will come under Obligations to do what is in their Power, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er to it. And there is none can do it (or &s;o much as pretend to it) But them|&s;elves. For as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Dome&s;tic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Intere&s;ts, it is a common living, that a M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n mu&s;t ask his Wife whether he &s;hall be Rich? So in this Ca&s;e, we mu&s;t ask our Merchants, whether we &s;hall have our Money Medium, yea, or no? It is certain we are happy, in a Celebrated, Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e and Powerful Government; who can do very Great Things, being Endowed with a Civil Omnipotency, but they cannot help us in this point. When we had our <HI>Money,</HI> they did all they could; they Enacted frightful and pen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l Laws; Erected Walls, and &s;et their Guards to Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e it; but could not keep it; and now its gone cannot command it back again.</P>
<P>Or may we imagine, that the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h will bring us in according as it is computed, <HI>Fifty Thou&s;and Pounds;</HI> and &s;hould it do &s;o, and much of it in <HI>Money?</HI> we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the Merchants have a peculiar Do|minion over this Valuable Staple. And the Out|let is va&s;t, (as Salt, Rigging, &amp;c. Provi&s;ions, Sea-Stores Craft, and what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot) and all is from the Merchant, &amp;c. that is the Money comes, it mu&s;t needs fall into the Merchants hands, as the Figgs into the mouth of the Eater, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But you will &s;ay, the Merchant mu&s;t di&s;per&s;e abundance of the Money, he mu&s;t Live, and Buy Provi&s;ions, for the Support of him&s;elf &amp; Family. Ah! Dear Country! They have &s;o many Subter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uges, and whiprows for a Livelihood that there is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;tarving them out of their Money, when they have once <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ot it! may be they will want now and then a few Apples for the Children, or

a fat Fowle for the Table, &amp;c. but ala&s;s! they'll of|ten make a Ribbon, or &s;ome &s;uch pretty thing do, to Coaxes the Farmer's Daughter of her Cargo, and &s;ave their Money. And as to the main of their Cheer, and Maintenance. <HI>Scil.</HI> Their Furniture, their Cloathing, Corn, Flower, Salt Provi&s;ion, yea almo&s;t a full &s;upply, do they know how to fetch by their Merchandize, from other Places and &s;ave their Money, &amp;c. but &s;up|po&s;e &s;ome con&s;iderable Part, would Circulate; It is always pa&s;&s;ing into the Gang way of our Merchants; and they are always upon the Watch, to make their Re|turns, and this is one of the mo&s;t profitable Species to that Purpo&s;e, &amp;c. &s;o that Money held and Impro|ved upon &s;uch Terms is but like a &s;cramble, catch it w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o can catch: Or but like a Flock of Wild Fowle much beaten, which is always ready to &s;tart and be done, that they are no profitable Game. So I &s;ay &s;uch a S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h parcel of Money, or Money in a Country Im|proved upon &s;uch fickle Terms, is mo&s;t certainly no Medium to be depended upon, in the Wi&s;e manage|ment, and &s;teady carrying on of Bu&s;ine&s;s. So that up|on this Suppo&s;ition, that the Money may be Recovered and Pre&s;erved for our u&s;e, it mu&s;t be done by our Merchants. Therefore if you are po&s;itive, and re&s;ol|ved, that you cannot do without the Money, you mu&s;t then Oblige your Merchants to fetch it; and when it is comes, they mu&s;t keep it for you, and not make Returns with it. But let it go in Copartner|&s;hip, and as Colleague with the Bills, for a Medium of Trade, is in <HI>Venice,</HI> &amp;c. And for this end (as things are now &s;tated) under the &s;ettlement, and In|&s;pection of the Government, &amp;c.
