<HEAD>BRIEF OBSERVATIONS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is propo&s;ed in the&s;e few pages&mdash;to give &s;ome ac|count of the doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation, as late|ly proclaimed in this city&mdash;to con&s;ider the principal arguments by which it is attempted to be &s;upport|ed&mdash;to mention &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture which are incon&s;i&s;tent with it&mdash;and to point out &s;ome of the con&s;equences which will follow from it.</P>
<P N="1">I. The doctrine is, that all mankind, without exception but none of the devils, will be &s;aved; that this univer&s;al &s;alvation will take place imme|diately after the general judgment, &s;o that after that time, there will be no puni&s;hment of any in|dividual of the human race; that this deliverance from future puni&s;hment is obtained in the way of the mo&s;t &s;trict ju&s;tice; that Chri&s;t having paid the whole debt, for all mankind, it is not con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice, that any man &s;hould be puni&s;hed for &s;in, in his own per&s;on; that the &s;inners of the old world however, were kept in hell from the flood till the crucifixion of Chri&s;t, and that during the three days, that Chri&s;t's body lay in the Grave,
<PB N="4" REF="018455_0003_0FA76EBF404050D8">
his &s;pirit went and preached the go&s;pel to them, and delivered them from further puni&s;hment; that <HI>perhaps</HI> tho&s;e who die in impenitence and and unbelief, may, till the final judgment, be in the &s;ame &s;tate, in which the &s;inners of the old world were, before the death of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">II. I am to con&s;ider the principal arguments by which this &s;y&s;tem is attempted to be &s;upported.</P>
<P>It is argued partly, from the divine goodne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion, but chiefly from &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture. The arguments from divine good|ne&s;s, equally prove that all <HI>devils,</HI> as that all <HI>men,</HI> will be &s;aved. If a God of infinite goodne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion cannot inflict endle&s;s puni&s;hment on a fallen <HI>man,</HI> how can he inflict the &s;ame on a fall|en <HI>angel</HI>? True goodne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion do not act with partial bia&s;&s;es and attachments, but &s;ee the happine&s;s of every intelligent being, who&s;e happine&s;s is con&s;i&s;tent with the good of the &s;y&s;tem. To &s;ay, there is no atonement made for the fallen <HI>angels,</HI> gives no &s;atisfaction. For why did not in|finite goodne&s;s provide an atonement for them, as well as for mankind? If it be &s;aid, that the per|dition of devils is not incon&s;i&s;tent with goodne&s;s, becau&s;e it is not oppo&s;ed to the good of the &s;y&s;tem in general, but nece&s;&s;ary to it: I an&s;wer, in the &s;ame way the eternal perdition of ungodly men, may be reconciled with goodne&s;s.&mdash;The argument from the divine goodne&s;s is al&s;o wholly incon&s;i&s;tent with the well known di&s;pen&s;ations of providence towards mankind in this world. The argument
<PB N="5" REF="018455_0004_0FA76EC1F4455CE8">
hath been &s;tated thus;
<Q>Can you, an affection|ate parent, take your own child, and ca&s;t it into a glowing oven?&mdash;No&mdash;But hath not God as much goodne&s;s and tenderne&s;s as you? How then can you &s;uppo&s;e, that he will ca&s;t any of his children, into the lake of fire and brim&s;tone, and confine them there forever.</Q>
&mdash;On this argu|ment I ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. That it equally militates again&s;t the eternal puni&s;hment of any of the fallen angels, as any of fallen men: for they are the children of God by creation, as truly as men. It is however true, that though we cannot bear to ca&s;t our children into glowing ovens, yet God can and does, fir&s;t neglect the means nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;alvation of &s;ome of his children, and then ca&s;t them into the the of fire and brim&s;tone.</P>
<P N="2">2. That it al&s;o proves, (&s;o far as it proves any thing) that God cannot afflict and de&s;troy mankind, as we all know he does, in this world. Permit me in my turn, to u&s;e this argument:&mdash;
<Q>Can you an affectionate parent, throw down your child from eminences, &s;o as to brake his bones, mangle his fle&s;h, and di&s;locate his neck? Or can you plunge him into a raging &s;ea, and leave him to the mercy of the waves? Can you ca&s;t him to be devour|ed by lions or tygers? Can you voluntarily bring on him the tortures of convul&s;ions, of the cho|lick or of the &s;tone? Can you &s;et your hou&s;e on fire, and in it con&s;ume your wife, your chil|dren and whole family together?&mdash;I know, you
<PB N="6" REF="018455_0005_0FA76EC3F16BA838">
cannot think of doing any of the&s;e. But hath not God as much goodne&s;s and tenderne&s;s as you? How then can you &s;uppo&s;e that he will ever treat any of his children in this manner?</Q>
&mdash;Yet in fact he doth all tho&s;e things to his chil|dren: The in&s;tances are very common.&mdash;This &s;hows the ab&s;urdity of all &s;uch arguments, as that &s;tated above; which however are the mo&s;t popular, and with many, the mo&s;t convincing ar|guments employed to prove univer&s;al &s;alvation. It is mere trifling to argue again&s;t future puni&s;hment, on principles which cannot be reconciled with God's common providence: and to a&s;&s;ert boldly that God cannot do what we all &s;ee and know, that he in fact doth.</P>
<P>The principal texts of &s;cripture, produced in &s;upport of this doctrine, are the&s;e which follow.</P>
<P>I. Cor. 15.22.
<Q>As in Adam all die, even &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive.</Q>
From the&s;e words it is argued, that as all mankind died in Adam, &s;o all mankind will live eternally in and through Chri&s;t.&mdash;In this chapter, the Apo&s;tle is di&s;cour&s;ing of the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t's people, the whole body of his followers, Ver&s;e 23.
<Q>But every man in his own order, Chri&s;t the fir&s;t fruits, afterward <HI>they that are Chri&s;t's,</HI> at his co|ming.</Q>
The&s;e words immediately follow tho&s;e now under con&s;ideration, and plainly &s;hew the &s;en&s;e of the Apo&s;tle in the 22d. ver&s;e to be, that all <HI>Chri&s;t's,</HI> all his <HI>di&s;ciples,</HI> or his <HI>followers</HI> &s;hall be made alive in him. But who tho&s;e are whom the
<PB N="7" REF="018455_0006_0FA76EC544755798">
Apo&s;tle calls <HI>Chri&s;t's,</HI> or his <HI>people,</HI> his <HI>followers,</HI> is not determined in this text. It is however abun|dantly determined by the whole New Te&s;tament, that they are the <HI>penitent</HI> and <HI>believing,</HI> and they only. As all who were in Adam, or were repre|&s;ented by him, died in him; &s;o all who are in Chri&s;t, or are repre&s;ented by him, &s;hall live in him. But it is denied, that all men are in Chri&s;t, and are repre&s;ented by him, as their &s;piritual head, nor is this a&s;&s;erted in this text. The whole that is a&s;&s;ert|ed in it is, that all who are in Chri&s;t, &s;hall live by him, as all who were in Adam, died in con&s;e|quence of his Fall.</P>
<P>But in aid of the con&s;truction of the text afore|&s;aid, which I oppo&s;e, it is &s;aid, "that the head of every man is Chri&s;t;" which is &s;uppo&s;ed to mean, that every man is in Chri&s;t, and is repre&s;ented by him. The words are in I. Cor. 11.3. "The head of every man is Chri&s;t, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Chri&s;t is God." I grant that, as in the work of redemp|tion, the character and office of God the father is &s;uperior to the Son; and as in the family oecono|my, the hu&s;band is &s;uperior to his wife in honour and authority: &s;o Chri&s;t is exalted in authority and dominion over all mankind. In this &s;en&s;e too, he is the head of the devils, as he is "made head over all things to the church," and "all things are put under his feet, he only excepted, who put all things under him." But that he is &s;o the head of all men, that all will be &s;aved by him, does not appear.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="018455_0007_0FA76EC60DB00358">But it is pleaded, that "Chri&s;t died for all;" that he is "the Saviour of all men;"&mdash;that he is "the Saviour of the world,"&mdash;"and a pro|pitiation for the &s;ins of the whole world"&mdash;"that he gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all"&mdash;"and that he ta&s;ted death for every man."&mdash;Doubtle&s;s the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions are &s;trictly true, as Chri&s;t has made an atonement, or laid a foundetion in his death and &s;ufferings, for the &s;alvation of all mankind: &s;o that &s;alvation is offered to all:&mdash;ALL without exception are invited to accept it. But what if &s;ome ob&s;tinately refu&s;e to accept it?&mdash;Will they &s;till inherit this &s;alvation?&mdash;This is not a&s;&s;erted in any one of tho&s;e texts now referred to: Yet it &s;hould be a&s;&s;erted, to make them at all to the pur|po&s;e of univer&s;al &s;alvation. All that is a&s;&s;erted, is, that Chri&s;t has made atonement or provi&s;ion for the &s;alvation of all men. But this no more proves that all men will in fact be &s;aved, than if a prince &s;hould make a fea&s;t &s;ufficient to entertain all the inhabitants of a city, this proves, that all tho&s;e in|habitants will actually partake of the fea&s;t. Not|with&s;tanding this provi&s;ion, a great part may re|fu&s;e to comply with the royal invitation, and thus exclude them&s;elves&mdash;Yet it is true that there was a fea&s;t made for all.&mdash;In like manner the provi|&s;ion made by Chri&s;t is abundantly &s;ufficient for all; yet &s;ome exclude them&s;elves by their unbelief.&mdash; In this &s;en&s;e Chri&s;t gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, and ta&s;ted death for every man: and this &s;en&s;e of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages is plainly given by the &s;cripture it|&s;elf,
<PB N="9" REF="018455_0008_0FA76EC6C9E130A8">
particularly in John iii. 16. "God &s;o loved <HI>the world,</HI> that he gave his only begotten Son," not that all mankind might be &s;aved by him, but "that <HI>whoever believeth in him,</HI> &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life."</P>
<P>It is further pleaded, that God "will have all men to be &s;aved,"&mdash;that he hath "no plea&s;ure in the death of the wicked,"&mdash;and that he is "not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h." The death or perdition of the wicked is not in it&s;elf a de&s;irable object; in this view God doth not, nor can take plea&s;ure in it: he cannot delight in the puni&s;hment and de&s;truction of his creatures &s;im|ply con&s;idered. Yet he may inflict on them pu|ni&s;hment and de&s;truction, when they are nece&s;&s;ary to vindicate his character, to &s;upport his law, to re&s;train others from &s;in, and to promote the good of the whole.&mdash;The texts now under con&s;ideration are to be taken in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e with Lam. iii. 33. "He doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the chil|dren of men." And Ho&s;. xi. 8. "How &s;hall I give thee up, Ephraim? How &s;hall I deliver thee, I&s;rael? How &s;hall I make thee as Admah? How &s;hall I &s;et thee as Zeboim? Mine heart is turned within me; my repentings are kindled together." &mdash;A mo&s;t benevolent parent may find it nece&s;&s;ary to cha&s;ti&s;e, and even to di&s;inherit a child. Yet he never does it, as we &s;ay, <HI>of choice</HI>; but with great reluctance. It is true, all things con&s;idered, he may choo&s;e to do it. Still, in it&s;elf, it is very di&s;a|greeable and painful to him.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="018455_0009_0FA76EC7818D8D70">Jer. xxxi. 34. "They &s;hall all know me from the lea&s;t of them, to the greate&s;t of them," hath been introduced as an argument of univer&s;al &s;al|vation, becau&s;e, <HI>to know God is life eternal.</HI> But tho&s;e words of Jeremiah refer not to the &s;tate of things after the general judgment, but to the mil|lenial &s;tate, and are equivalent to I&s;ai. xi. 9. "For the earth &s;hall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the &s;ea;" and to Hab. ii. 14.&mdash;But it is not pretended, that uni|ver&s;al &s;alvation will be effected on <HI>this earth,</HI> or before the general judgment, which is to be in the air, not on this globe. It is granted that in the general re&s;urrection, &s;ome will come forth to the re&s;urrection of damnation. Therefore univer&s;al &s;alvation will not take place before that period.</P>
<P>A further argument hath been drawn from Rev. v. 13. "Every creature which is in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth, and &s;uch as are in the &s;ea, and all that are in them, heard I, &s;aying, ble&s;&s;|ing, and honour," &amp;c. It is &s;aid that the&s;e words &s;how, that all men will finally unite in hymns of prai&s;e to God and the Lamb and therefore will be &s;aved. But this text &s;ays nothing particularly of <HI>all men:</HI> it &s;peaks of <HI>all creature</HI>&punc; rational and ir|rational, animate and inanimate, and repre&s;ents them as joining with the angels, the four bea&s;ts, and elders, in a hymn of prai&s;e, and is an in&s;tance of the figure called <HI>pro&s;opopaeia,</HI> &s;imilar to that in P&s;al. xix. 1. and in P&s;al. cxlviii. 1&mdash;11. It is therefore nothing to the purpo&s;e of the &s;alvation
<PB N="11" REF="018455_0010_0FA76EC85D1EC9C8">
of all men.&mdash;Be&s;ides; this text as much implies the &s;alvation of all devils, as of all men, and &s;o if it prove any thing, proves too much for tho&s;e by whom it is quoted in the pre&s;ent que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Phil. ii. 10. "That at the name of Je&s;us, eve|ry knee &s;hould bow, of things in heaven, and things on earth, and things under the earth, and that eve|ry tongue &s;hould confe&s;s that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is Lord," &amp;c. Is &s;uppo&s;ed to imply the &s;alvation of all men. But this is a mere declaration of Chri&s;t's exaltation, and of the &s;ubjection of all things to him, and is tantamount to tho&s;e texts before quoted, which declare, that he is made head over all things to the church; and that all things are put under his feet. But the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages do not imply, that all men will <HI>voluntarily</HI> &s;ubmit to him. See al&s;o Rom. xiv.9&mdash;13.</P>
<P>From "the re&s;titution of all things," mention|ed in Acts iii. 21. it hath been argued, that all men will be re&s;tored to the favour of God. On this I ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>That the&s;e words might well have been render|ed, The <HI>completion</HI> or <HI>com&s;ummation</HI> of all things, and are &s;o rendered and interpreted by &s;ome of the be&s;t commentators.&mdash;If they be taken &s;trictly ac|cording to the pre&s;ent tran&s;lation, they will prove that all devils are to be re&s;tored to the divine fa|vour, as well as <HI>all men.</HI> Therefore they prove too much for tho&s;e with whom I am at pre&s;ent con|cerned.&mdash;But the original puts this text entirely out of the pre&s;ent que&s;tion. Without in&s;i&s;ting on a different rendering of the word tran&s;lated <HI>re&s;titu|tion,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="018455_0011_0FA76EC9028176D8">
the &s;en&s;e according to the original is this<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pantoon oon elalee&s;en.</NOTE>; the times of the re&s;titution of <HI>all tho&s;e things which</HI> God hath &s;poken by the mouth of all his prophets. So that if the re&s;toration of all men be a doctrine taught by the prophets, this text declares, that the time will come, when &s;uch a re&s;toration will be effected. Otherwi&s;e it &s;ays nothing concerning it. &mdash;This text is &s;ometimes introduced in this man|ner; "The re&s;titution of all things is declared by all the prophets from the foundation of the world:" Which is a perver&s;ion of the text, and &s;hows either great di&s;hone&s;ty, or great inattention to the original.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the principal &s;criptures on which the doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation, as lately publi&s;hed among us, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be founded, and whether they be a &s;ufficient foundation, I now appeal to every candid man, who is but tolerably acquainted with the &s;criptures.</P>
<P N="3">III. I am to mention &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture which appear to be irreconcileable with the &s;alva|tion of all men.</P>
<P>Matt. xxv. 31&mdash;46. e&s;pecially v. 41. "Depart ye cur&s;ed into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels." It is pretended that the goats on the left hand, in this pa&s;&s;age, are the devils; that the &s;heep on the right, are all mankind, and that the devils are condemned to everla&s;ting fire, becau&s;e they re&s;trained men from acts of charity.&mdash;Why then is it not &s;aid, Depart,
<PB N="13" REF="018455_0012_0FA76EC9C92CE850">
ye cur&s;ed, &amp;c. not becau&s;e I was an hungred, and <HI>ye gave</HI> me no meat; but becau&s;e I was an hun|gred and ye <HI>re&s;trained others</HI> from giving me meat? &mdash;And why was it not &s;aid, Depart, ye cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting fire prepared for <HI>you?</HI> not, for <HI>the devil and his angels,</HI> implying, that they were dif|ferent per&s;ons from tho&s;e to whom the Judge was &s;peaking.&mdash;But the 32d. v. puts this matter out of all di&s;pute, "Before him &s;hall be gathered <HI>all na|tions</HI>; and he &s;hall &s;eparate <HI>them</HI> one from another, as a &s;hepherd divideth his &s;heep from the goats." What is the antecedent of <HI>them?</HI> not &s;urely the devils, for they are not mentioned in the context. It is the <HI>nations</HI>; and to &s;ay that <HI>them</HI> refers to any other antecedent, is a violation of all the rules of grammatical con&s;truction.&mdash;But to &s;uch &s;hifts as the&s;e, the advocates for univer&s;al &s;alvation are re|duced, to reconcile their doctrine with the &s;crip|tures! Surely that doctrine mu&s;t be very foreign from the &s;criptures, which can be no better recon|ciled with them, than univer&s;al &s;alvation can with this pa&s;&s;age in the 25th of Matthew.</P>
<P>Rev. xiv. 11. "And the &s;moke of their tor|ment a&s;cendeth up forever and ever: and they have no re&s;t day nor night, who wor&s;hip the bea&s;t and his image."&mdash;If <HI>the bea&s;t</HI> mean what is com|monly under&s;tood by it, Rome heathen and papal, the wor&s;hippers are not merely the devils, but &s;ome men are comprehended in the number.&mdash;If <HI>the bea&s;t</HI> mean the devil him&s;elf, &s;till &s;ome <HI>men</HI> are comprehended in the number of <HI>his</HI> wor&s;hippers.
<PB N="14" REF="018455_0013_0FA76ECC67918FF8">
See I. Cor. x. 20. Thus on every &s;uppo&s;ition, this text declares that &s;ome <HI>men</HI> will be tormented for|ever and ever.</P>

Chri&s;t, i. e. that Chri&s;t &s;hould die for a &s;inner, is no proper &s;ubject of threatning, as it is the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing ever granted to a fallen world; as well might we be threatened with the inheritance of heaven.&mdash;Again; that this threatning, if it be &s;o called, might as well have been denounced on the righteous, as on the wicked; it being granted on all hands, that Chri&s;t died for the penitent and be|lieving.&mdash;Once more; that if the&s;e words, "the &s;oul that &s;inneth it &s;hall die," mean that &s;uch a &s;oul &s;hould die in Chri&s;t, as Chri&s;t &s;hould die in its &s;tead, and the &s;oul per&s;onally &s;hould not die: with as much authority will I &s;ay, that the&s;e words, "He is ju&s;t, he &s;hall &s;urely live," mean only that he &s;hall live in Chri&s;t, as Chri&s;t &s;hall live in his &s;tead, but the man per&s;onally &s;hall not live at all.</P>
<P>Thus the&s;e men, while they attempt to reduce or annihilate the threatnings of &s;cripture, equally annihilate the promi&s;es, and entirely overthrow that very univer&s;al &s;alvation, for which they &s;o earne&s;tly plead.</P>
<P>There is &s;till another mode of evading the texts of &s;cripture, which a&s;&s;ert a future puni&s;hment; this is by &s;uppo&s;ing that the &s;ins of men are to be &s;eparated from the men them&s;elves, and to be &s;ent to hell, while the men who committed tho&s;e &s;ins are to be taken to heaven. Thus the chaff in Matt. iii. 12.

<P N="1">1. That it is difficult to conceive how this in|terpretation can be reconciled with mo&s;t of tho&s;e texts quoted above, or with others which may be quoted; as Phil. iii. 18, 19. Tho&s;e who&s;e end is de&s;truction, are &s;aid to be the enemies of the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, who&s;e God is their belly. Sins are in|deed acts of enmity, but not <HI>enemies,</HI> nor have they any <HI>bellies</HI> to be their Gods.&mdash;Tho&s;e who, accor|ding to II. The&s;&s;. i. 8, 9. are to be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de&s;truction, are not lifele&s;s actions, but per&s;ons (oitines, in the ma&s;culine gender) who know not God, and obey not the go&s;pel. But &s;ins are capable of neither knowledge nor obedience. In II. Cor. xi. 15. Fal&s;e apo&s;tles and evil workers, who were Hebrews, I&s;raelites, the &s;eed of Abra|ham, are &s;aid to come to an end according to their works. But &s;ins are neither fal&s;e nor true apo&s;tles, neither good nor evil workers, are neither I&s;raelites, Hebrews, nor the &s;eed of Abraham; nor can they perform any works, according to which their end &s;hall be. II. Pet. iii. 7. &s;peaks of the perdition not of <HI>&s;ins,</HI> but <HI>men.</HI> Surely the Jews and Greeks to whom the go&s;pel was fooli&s;hne&s;s, and who there|fore peri&s;hed, were not <HI>&s;ins</HI>&punc; but <HI>&s;inners.</HI> And what an ab&s;urdity to &s;ay, that the &s;ins of men draw back from the go&s;pel faith unto perdition, according to Heb. x. 39</P>
<P N="2">2. It is equally difficult to reconcile the idea of <HI>&s;in's &s;uffering,</HI> or being <HI>tormented,</HI> with common

&s;en&s;e. How can the &s;ins of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors be eaten by worms, or burnt with fire, while the tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ors them&s;elves are in heaven? How can an act of murder, or fornication, or bla&s;phemy, be torment|ed forever and ever in fire and brim&s;tone, while the authors of tho&s;e actions are in perfect bli&s;s? If &s;uch puni&s;hments are fea&s;ible, and an&s;wer the end of puni&s;hment, why are they not adopted by human legi&s;lators? Why is not felony hanged, or cropt and branded, and the felons &s;uffered to go free?&mdash; But the ab&s;urdity &s;ufficiently appears: it would be altogether as good &s;en&s;e to talk of puni&s;hing the north-we&s;t wind, or tormenting the &s;ound of a trumpet.</P>
<P N="3">3. With regard to that text in I&s;ai. lxvi. 24. it &s;eems to be very unluckily cho&s;en to prove, that <HI>&s;ins</HI> are to be tormented, but the <HI>&s;inners</HI> &s;aved.

As the pro|phet had been ju&s;t &s;peaking of the new heavens and new earth, the&s;e words, I &s;uppo&s;e on all hands are allowed to be de&s;criptive of the heavenly &s;tate. Therefore <HI>all fle&s;h</HI> &s;hall be admitted into the hea|venly &s;tate. But <HI>fle&s;h</HI> in &s;cripture very commonly &s;ignifies the <HI>&s;in</HI> or <HI>wickedne&s;s</HI> of men.

But the worm of tho&s;e who have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed again&s;t God &s;hall never die, and their fire &s;hall never be quenched. Now all men without exception have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed again&s;t God. Therefore all men with|out exception, &s;hall &s;uffer eternal torments in hell, while their &s;ins &s;hall enjoy eternal peace and hap|pine&s;s in heaven.&mdash;Thus we &s;ee to what conclu&s;ions we are led, by taking no greater liberty with the &s;criptures, than tho&s;e take with whom I am now concerned.</P>
<P N="4">IV. I am to point out &s;ome of the con&s;equences which will follow from this &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P N="1">1. It follows from this &s;y&s;tem, that the confine|ment of the &s;inners of the old world in the pri&s;on of hell, till the death of Chri&s;t, and the &s;imilar treatment of tho&s;e who die in impenitence and un|belief, is a direct violation of ju&s;tice, and can no more be reconciled with it, than the eternal puni&s;h|ment of a great part of mankind. The rea&s;on why it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be incon&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice, that any men &s;hould be eternally puni&s;hed, is, that Chri&s;t as the &s;ub&s;titute of all mankind, hath taken the whole puni&s;hment of &s;in on him&s;elf, and hath paid for all men the whole debt. Therefore pay|ment being made by the &s;ub&s;titute, it is unju&s;t to exact payment of any &s;inner in his own per&s;on.</P>
<P>This would be to exact double payment.&mdash;On the &s;ame principle I argue, that if Chri&s;t has &s;o paid the <HI>whole</HI> debt for all men, that it is unju&s;t to in|flict the <HI>whole</HI> puni&s;hment of &s;in on <HI>the per&s;on</HI> of any &s;inner, it is al&s;o unju&s;t to inflict on the per&s;on
<PB N="23" REF="018455_0022_0FA76ED7425D4538">
of any &s;inner <HI>a part</HI> of the puni&s;hment; as this would be <HI>&s;o far</HI> to exact double payment of the debt: and to exact double payment for <HI>a part</HI> of a debt is as <HI>real</HI> inju&s;tice, though not &s;o great a de|gree of it, as to exact double payment for <HI>the whole.</HI> &mdash;Therefore ju&s;tice was entirely violated, in con|fining the &s;inners of the old world, in the pri&s;on of hell, for more than two thou&s;and years.</P>
<P N="2">2. It follows from this &s;y&s;tem, that the <HI>divine ju&s;tice</HI> is violated al&s;o by all the tokens of divine wrath or di&s;plea&s;ure, which are ever inflicted on men, in this life. That there have been many tokens of divine wrath inflicted on men, in this life, cannot be denied, to be &s;ure, by tho&s;e who believe the divine authority of the &s;criptures: &s;uch was the de&s;truction of the old world, of Sodom and Gomarrah, of the Canaanites, of Pharaoh and his army in the Red-Sea, of Jeru&s;alem by Nebuchad|nezzar, and afterwards by the Romans, when wrath came upon them to the uttermo&s;t; the death of Nadab and Abihu, of Hophni and Phi|nehas, of Ananias and Sapphira, &amp;c. &amp;c. The&s;e are plain in&s;tances of puni&s;hment of &s;in inflicted by God; but how can the&s;e, on the &s;y&s;tem which I oppo&s;e, be reconciled with divine jus&s;tice, any more than the everla&s;ting puni&s;hment of &s;in? If the&s;e puni&s;hments were ju&s;t, it follows that Chri&s;t has not &s;o paid the whole debt, but that it is con|&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice that &s;inners &s;hould be puni&s;hed in their own per&s;ons: and therefore the argument in favour of univer&s;al &s;alvation, drawn from the
<PB N="24" REF="018455_0023_0FA76ED86F95E280">
con&s;ideration of Chri&s;t's having paid the <HI>whole debt,</HI> entirely falls to the ground.</P>
<P>I may al&s;o mention the calamities to which all mankind are liable, and which they con&s;tantly &s;uf|fer; the &s;ickne&s;s, pains and &s;orrows, the vexations and di&s;appointments, which await us all; the pangs of child-birth, the agonies of death, &amp;c. To &s;ay that the&s;e are the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of &s;in and could not have been prevented by the Deity, is an affront to rea&s;on and an impeachment of the divine Omnipotence. It was in the power of Om|nipotence, to have con&s;tituted things in &s;uch a manner, that child-bearing and death &s;hould have been without the lea&s;t pain, or that we &s;hould all have been tran&s;lated without ta&s;ting death.&mdash;With equal ea&s;e could God have prevented every other temporal calamity.&mdash;To &s;ay that the&s;e calamities are mere parental cha&s;ti&s;ements de&s;igned for our good, and therefore not puni&s;hments or tokens of divine di&s;plea&s;ure, is contradictory. For no good parent ever cha&s;ti&s;ed a child, but for &s;ome fault, at which he was di&s;plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>What then are all the&s;e calamities of life and agonies of death, but &s;o many tokens of God's di&s;|plea&s;ure at &s;in? But &s;uch tokens of God's di&s;|plea&s;ure can never be reconciled with ju&s;tice, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that Chri&s;t &s;o paid the whole debt of puni&s;hment for all mankind, that ju&s;tice will not allow, that they be puni&s;hed in their own per|&s;ons. And if ju&s;tice will allow that men be pun|i&s;hed in their own per&s;ons, it is a matter of grace,
<PB N="25" REF="018455_0024_0FA76ED8E7C7F1D8">
&s;overeign grace, that any of mankind are &s;aved; and if any, who and how many.</P>
<P N="3">3. It follows from this &s;y&s;tem, that we have an ab&s;olute and immediate right, on the footing of <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> to the inheritance of heaven and all its ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, and that we are injured by the Deity, in being kept out of it for a day or an hour. Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed heaven for us, equally as an e&s;cape from hell. But to be kept out of a glorious inheritance, to which we have an entire and ab&s;o|lute right on the &s;ooting of ju&s;tice, and at the &s;ame time, to be detained a &s;tate of impri&s;onment, as is in the ca&s;e with a great part of mankind (Zach. ix. 12.) or in &s;uch a &s;tate that even the be&s;t of men groan being burdened, and are in bondage, (Rom. viii. 23. and II. Cor. v. 2,&mdash;5. and Heb. ii. 14, 15.) is not merely to be injured, but to &s;uffer an injury which is great and oppre&s;&s;ive.&mdash;If, to avoid this con&s;e|quence, it &s;hould be &s;aid, that doubtle&s;s Chri&s;t in the covenant between him and the father, con&s;ented that his redeemed &s;hould be kept out of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of heaven for a &s;ea&s;on; this would be to open a door at which certain gue&s;ts, very unwelcome to the advocates for univer&s;al &s;alvation, may ea&s;ily enter. For in this conce&s;&s;ion it is granted, that the purcha&s;e of Chri&s;t is not ab&s;olute and unconditional, but limited with &s;tipulations and conditions. Hence at once ari&s;es this que&s;tion; What are the &s;tipula|tions and conditions, on which an inheritance of the ble&s;&s;ings of Chri&s;t's purcha&s;e is to be obtained? Is not that purcha&s;e &s;o limited, that none can en|joy

the &s;aving ble&s;&s;ings of it, who die in impeni|tence and unbelief. Doubtle&s;s he who had a right to con&s;ent, that all men &s;hould for a &s;ea&s;on be kept from the enjoyment of the ble&s;&s;ings pur|cha&s;ed by Chri&s;t, had a right to con&s;ent that &s;ome men &s;hould be kept from them forever. And if, this being the ca&s;e, no injury is done tho&s;e who are excluded from tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings for a &s;ea&s;on, neither is any injury done tho&s;e who are finally excluded: becau&s;e the conditions of the purcha&s;e in either ca&s;e are fulfilled. It remains therefore to be &s;hewn, what are, and what are not, the conditions of en|joying the ble&s;&s;ings purcha&s;ed by Chri&s;t; and the argument from the ab&s;olute purcha&s;e, whether of e&s;cape from hell, or of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of heaven en|tirely falls to the ground.</P>
<P N="4">4.

Perfection in holine&s;s is a part of the pur|cha&s;e of Chri&s;t. (Heb. xii. 23. and Rev. xxi. 27.)

may &s;ay, he has con&s;ented that &s;ome &s;hould re|main without it for ever.</P>
<P N="5">5. It follows from this &s;y&s;tem, that we are under no obligation to obey the divine law.&mdash;Chri&s;t has equally obeyed the law for us, as he has &s;uffered the penalty. He has equally paid the debt of obe|dience, as the debt of puni&s;hment. Now if, &s;ince Chri&s;t has paid the debt of puni&s;hment, to exact puni&s;hment of men per&s;onally, be to exact double payment of the debt; then, &s;ince Chri&s;t has paid the debt of obedience, to exact obedience of men per&s;onally, is to exact double payment of the debt of obedience; which is unju&s;t, tyrannical and oppre&s;&s;ive, and can never con&s;i&s;t with the divine rectitude and perfection. It fol|lows therefore that we are under no obligation to obey the divine law in any particular, whether as it re&s;pects God or men.&mdash;We are under no obliga|tion to love the Lord our God with all our heart, to ob&s;erve his Sabbath, his ordinances of public or private wor&s;hip, or to comply with any precept of the fir&s;t table. Equally free are we from obliga|tion to love our neighbour as our&s;elves, to &s;peak the truth, to practi&s;e ju&s;tice, fidelity, humanity, charity, temperance, &s;obriety, or any other vir|tue.&mdash;And where there is no law, there is no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Therefore, according to this &s;y&s;|tem, we are not capable of committing &s;in; and though we &s;hould fall into profanene&s;s, perjury, bla&s;phemy; though we &s;hould practi&s;e inju&s;tice, fraud, theft, malice, revenge, murder, they would
<PB N="28" REF="018455_0027_0FA76EDD949E1380">
be no &s;in, but would be as perfectly innocent, as tho&s;e which are e&s;teemed the mo&s;t amiable virtues.</P>
<P N="6">6. It follows from this &s;y&s;tem, that <HI>grace</HI> is in a great mea&s;ure excluded from the plan or &s;alva|tion publi&s;hed in the go&s;pel. In the late exhibi|tion of univer&s;al &s;alvation in this place, the preacher him&s;elf declared, "that however &s;ome hoped to be &s;aved by <HI>free grace, he</HI> expected to be &s;aved in the way of <HI>&s;trict ju&s;tice.</HI>" This declaration is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with his general &s;y&s;tem, and nece&s;&s;arily implied in it. For if we have a right <HI>on the footing of ju&s;tice,</HI> to deliverance from hell, and admi&s;&s;ion to heaven, we doubtle&s;s have the <HI>&s;ame right</HI> to conver&s;ion, pardon, ju&s;tification, the teachings and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;pirit, in &s;hort, to every ble&s;&s;ing which Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed.&mdash;If &s;o, where is the grace in communicating the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings? Manife&s;tly there is no grace in the communication of any of them. They are <HI>due</HI> to us, and, according to the &s;y&s;tem which I am op|po&s;ing, in communicating them, God does but di&s;charge his <HI>debts.</HI> But is not this grating to the ear of every chri&s;tian? It mo&s;t directly contradicts the whole go&s;pel, the language of which is, "By <HI>grace</HI> are ye &s;aved"&mdash;"Being ju&s;tified <HI>freely</HI> by his <HI>grace</HI>"&mdash;"in whom we have&mdash;forgivene&s;s according to the <HI>riches of his grace,</HI>" &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P N="7">7. It follows from this doctrine, that there is no foundation for <HI>thank&s;giving</HI> or <HI>prai&s;e,</HI> on ac|count of any of the forementioned ble&s;&s;ings of conver&s;ion, pardon, ju&s;tification, victory over the world, over our lu&s;ts, over &s;atan, or final and
<PB N="29" REF="018455_0028_0FA76EDF817BB708">
eternal glory. We are not obliged to thank any man for giving us our <HI>dues</HI>: nor are we any more obligated to render thanks to <HI>God</HI> if <HI>he</HI> only give us our dues. Therefore all that is &s;aid in the P&s;alms, or any other parts of &s;cripture, in the way of prai&s;e or gratitude, on account of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, is with|out rea&s;on or foundation, and the in&s;pired writers herein &s;how their great ignorance of the truth.</P>
<P N="8">8. It follows from this doctrine, that there is no foundation for <HI>prayer.</HI> To pray is to a&s;k a fa|vour. But all &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings being purcha&s;ed for us by Chri&s;t, we have a right to them on the footing of ju&s;tice, and therefore may properly <HI>de|mand</HI> them; and to pray for them, is to act out of character. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, there is no propriety in praying for temporal ble&s;&s;ings, if they are purcha&s;ed by Chri&s;t, as they are generally al|lowed to be.&mdash;Again, as we are under no obli|gation to obey the divine law, and are incapable of &s;in, we are of cour&s;e, in our own per&s;ons, per|fectly innocent, and being innocent, we de&s;erve none of of the calamities to which we are liable in the world, which are tokens of God's di&s;plea&s;ure. We may therefore demand exemption from them. As to tho&s;e calamities, which are tokens of the di|vine complacency or approbation, if any &s;uch there be, &s;urely no man in his &s;en&s;es would pray to be pre&s;erved or delivered from them.&mdash;From this in|duction of particulars, it appears, that there is no|thing in the univer&s;e, whether good or evil, whether of a temporal or a &s;piritual nature, which accord|ing to this &s;y&s;tem, can with propriety be made the &s;ubject of prayer.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="30" REF="018455_0029_0FA76EDF8BB26E38">9. This doctrine takes off all re&s;traints on wick|edne&s;s, ari&s;ing either from a &s;en&s;e of &s;in or moral evil, or from the pro&s;pect of puni&s;hment in the future &s;tate. Becau&s;e the doctrine not only a&s;&s;erts, that there is to be no future puni&s;hment, but as I have already &s;hewn, implies that men are not un|der moral obligation and con&s;equently are incapa|ble of &s;in. There is therefore no rea&s;on why men &s;hould avoid any actions, either through fear of fu|ture puni&s;hment, or through fear of contracting the guilt and turpitude of &s;in.&mdash;Nay, this doctrine greatly dimini&s;hes, if it do not entirely annihilate the the force of civil puni&s;hments. The greate&s;t and la&s;t of them is death. But if death be a &s;ure tran|&s;ition to complete and eternal happine&s;s, what is there in it terrible? The mere pains of death by the hands of the executioner, are &s;o momentary and all &s;en&s;ibility is &s;o &s;oon pa&s;t, that they cannot ju&s;tly excite any great terror. Thus this doctrine cuts the &s;inews of all civil government, and throws off almo&s;t every re&s;traint by which mankind, in the pre&s;ent depraved &s;tate, are kept in tolerable or|der.</P>
<P>Having now fini&s;hed what I propo&s;ed on this &s;ubject, I leave it with the candid reader to deter|mine, whether I have done ju&s;tice to tho&s;e &s;acred texts, which I &s;uppo&s;e to have been perverted to &s;upport the doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation; whe|ther of the many texts which &s;eem to declare a fu|ture puni&s;hment, the few which I have found room to in&s;ert in the&s;e ob&s;ervations, do &s;ufficiently
<PB N="31" REF="018455_0030_0FA76EE140ECC160">
e&s;tabli&s;h it; whether the remarks, which I have made on the &s;everal modes of evading the force of tho&s;e and &s;imilar texts, be pertinent; whether the con&s;equences, which I have mentioned, do not ne|ce&s;&s;arily follow from the doctrine which I oppo&s;e; and finally, whether, if the con&s;equences are ab&s;urd and even &s;hocking, the doctrine it&s;elf from which they follow, is not &s;o too.</P>
<P>I hope and pray, that the promulgation of uni|ver&s;al &s;alvation in this city, may be the means of happily exciting the attention of the citizens, to the important &s;ubject of a future &s;tate in general, and of future puni&s;hment in particular; that they may enquire for them&s;elves, make the &s;criptures the foundation of their faith, imitate the example of the noble <HI>Bereans</HI> in &s;earching the &s;criptures daily, with re&s;pect to this &s;ubject; and that in the i&s;&s;ue they may be e&s;tabli&s;hed on "The foundation of God, which &s;tandeth &s;ure, having this &s;eal, The Lord knoweth them that are his."</P>
