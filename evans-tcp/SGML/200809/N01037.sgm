<P N="2">2. The Crime: 1.

Again, they did evil in the &s;ight of the Lord; that is, they did that which was evil in his &s;ight: it may be in their own eyes, it might &s;eem good, they thought there was no hurt in it;
<PB N="5" REF="001234_0004_0FB182AE568A33E0">but it was evil in the &s;ight of the Lord: Again, they did evil in the &s;ight of the Lord; they carried &s;o as to provoke God to anger there was always &s;in and infirmity among them; but now they were &s;o bad, that God was provoked by their carriages; he con|demns them as a people of a corrupt carri|age. 2.

<Q>The Covenant People of God do &s;ometimes grow very corrupt in a little time.</Q>
<P>When the former Generation were dead that came into the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> they did evil in the &s;ight of the Lord: People are wont to be very incon&s;i&s;tent in goodne&s;s; as they are &s;ubject to many other changes, &s;o to changes in Religion; Piety is not natural to a people, and &s;o they do not hold it long; &s;ometimes when a people are grown cor|rupt, they hold that a great while; but when they are holy, it is not long before

<HEAD>QUESTION.</HEAD>
<P>How does this come to pa&s;s?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>ANSWER.</HEAD>
<P>The principal occa&s;ion is, that Godly men Dye, and there ri&s;es up an Unconvert|ed Generation in their room: many other things may meet together to help forward this Degeneracy; there be many temptati|ons that fall in to promote this corruption, as the example of Neighbouring Nations, the temptation of Wealth, the evil Opini|ons that are broached by particular per&s;ons; but the main rea&s;on of the degeneracy is
<PB N="7" REF="001234_0006_0FB182B124289780">that Good men dye, and go to Heaven one after another, and there ri&s;es up another Generation that are Unconverted, and they corrupt them&s;elves; they are born in Sin, and continue in their natural condition; they profe&s;s holine&s;s, but are not holy, and &s;o the Land is corrupted; Judg. 2. 10. <HI>There aro&s;e another Generation that knew not the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>This occa&s;ions Degeneracy the&s;e ways.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Hence they want Grace to re&s;train them in a Day of Temptation.</HI> In length of time there will ari&s;e con&s;iderable temptations, but if a people be gracious, it is hopeful, that they will with&s;tand tho&s;e temptations: Gracious men will not live in evil ways: 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 2. 9. <HI>He cannot &s;in, becau&s;e he is born of God:</HI> they have a principle of faith, and do believe the dangerou&s;ne&s;s of evil ways, and will be a|fraid: <HI>Job</HI> 31. 23. <HI>De&s;truction from God was a terrour to me;</HI> and they hate &s;inful ways, and cannot endure them, they are like green wood that will not take the fire &s;o readily as others: but if a temptation comes, car|nal men have not grace to re&s;train them, they have natural con&s;ciences, and a care of their reputation, but they want the prin|cipal thing to re&s;train them; it may be they will be commanded to do that which is &s;in|ful, and they have not grace to with&s;tand the command: <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 5. 11. <HI>Ephraim is oppre&s;|&s;ed
<PB N="8" REF="001234_0007_0FB182B52A6D6788">and broken in judgment, becau&s;e he willingly walked after the commandment,</HI> i.e. <HI>of Jerebo|am,</HI> Mic. 6. 16. <HI>The &s;tatutes of</HI> Omri <HI>are kept, and all the works of the hou&s;e of</HI> Ahab. It may be there will ari&s;e &s;ome fal&s;e Teachers, and many carnal men will fall in with their de|lu&s;ions, 2 Tim. 3. 6. <HI>Of this &s;ort are they that creep into hou&s;es, and lead captive &s;illy women, laden with &s;ins, led away with divers lu&s;ts.</HI> If per&s;ons don't fear God, they are liable to greate&s;t iniquities in a day of temptation; Gen. 20. 11. <HI>The fear of God is not in this place, and they will &s;lay me for my wives &s;ake.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>There will be many bad Examples.</HI> Where there be many holy men, they will be giv|ing good examples to others, they will walk in fear, carry humbly, and glorify God; Acts 24. 16. <HI>Herein do I exerci&s;e my &s;elf to have a con&s;cience void of offence, towards God and to|wards man.</HI> Where there be plenty of Holy men in a Land, there will be many good examples; men will be provoking one a|nother to an holy emulation: but where there be few good men, there will be a &s;car|city of good examples; many men will give bad examples, and others will be rea|dy to follow them; e&s;pecially the younger &s;ort of people; men are apt to follow the multitude: when they &s;ee others &s;in, they are taught to &s;in; the pride of others draws
<PB N="9" REF="001234_0008_0FB182B668F8D4A0">out their Pride, &amp; the covetou&s;ne&s;s of others draws out their coveteou&s;ne&s;s, as the fire in the coals draws out the fire that is in the wood: bad examples make men think, that there is no great danger in &s;in: bad examples make men think, &s;inful practices to be honourable, hence in time &s;ins grow natural.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>They will indulge their Children in Evil.</HI> Godly men may be too indulgent to their Children; but more generally Godly men will be careful in the Education of their Children, Gen. 18. 19. <HI>Abraham will com|mand his Children and his Hou&s;hold after him, and they &s;hall keep the ways of the Lord. Da|vid</HI> was very careful to principle <HI>Solomon,</HI> Prov. 4. 3, 4. So was <HI>Bath&s;heba,</HI> Prov. 31. 2, 3, 4. They are &s;olicitous for Gods Glo|ry, and the Salvation of their Children, and will be creful in Educating of them; but if the Generation be carnal, they will be neg|ligent in Educating them; they would have them be good husbands, and follow their bu&s;ine&s;s diligently; and they can't a|bide that they &s;hould do any thing that &s;hould occa&s;ion them to be fined; but there be abundance of mi&s;carriages that they do not much regard; they don't much mind it, if they be rude and misbehaved, if they run abroad in the night time, and be ab|&s;ent from Family Prayers, if they be vain
<PB N="10" REF="001234_0009_0FB182B7E883E320">and proud, and don't &s;anctify the Sabbath carefully; and if <HI>they</HI> do indulge their Children in evil, they will grow very bad: Children will be very corrupt, if not well governed; Eccle&s;. 11. 10. <HI>Childhood and Youth are vanity;</HI> Prov. 29. 15. <HI>A Child left to him&s;elf, bringeth his mother to &s;hame.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Godly men that are among them will be tainted.</HI> When a Country abounds with Godly men, they will &s;tir up one anothers graces, they will quicken and confirm one another, and &s;trive to excel: but when they are generally a carnal people, it will be a wonder, if they do not taint tho&s;e that be good; &s;weet liquor put into a cor|rupt ve&s;&s;el will be tainted; &s;o Good men in a corrupt Town or Country. It is true, that when wicked men carry very filthily, that does by an <HI>Antipari&s;ta&s;is</HI> &s;tir up the gra|ces of Godly men; P&s;al. 119. 126, 127. <HI>They have made void thy Law, therefore I love thy Commandments above gold.</HI> But when men are carnal, and carry on a profe&s;&s;ion of Religion, their mi&s;carriages do mightily taint Godly men, the air of the Country is infectious, and &s;ound men may be infected thereby; <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> learned to Swear in <HI>Egypt; Barnabas</HI> was carried away with the di&s;&s;i|mulation; <HI>Gal.</HI> 2. 13. Some of the good
<PB N="11" REF="001234_0010_0FB182B9634B6E50">King of <HI>Judah</HI> did not take away the High Places.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>They will grow very blind.</HI> When God converts men, he gives them light and un|der&s;tanding; Acts 26. 18. <HI>They are turned from darkne&s;s to light:</HI> And Spiritual Light recei|ved in Conver&s;ion, &s;trengthens the rea&s;on of men, and makes the law of nature more legible; but when a people are a carnal people, they will grow as blind as moles: they don't know the mercy, and wi&s;dom, and holine&s;s of God, and &s;o are not &s;en&s;i|ble how &s;uch carriages do reflect upon him: they think there is weighty rea&s;on for &s;ome carriages that are indeed &s;inful; their affections do darken their minds, they don't judge that pride that is pride, nor that to be intemperance that is intemperance: be&s;ides, &s;uch men will not &s;tudy the mind of God, nor pray for light as Godly, men do, and &s;o they grow blind; I&s;a. 5. 20 <HI>They call light darkne&s;s, and darkne&s;s light:</HI> Con&s;cience in &s;ome ca&s;es gives them a li|berty to &s;in, and in &s;ome ca&s;es it urges them to &s;in.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>They won't much regard the warnings of the Word, or the Judgments of God.</HI> When God gives warning in his Word, Godly
<PB N="12" REF="001234_0011_0FB182BAEA9FAEA0">men are wont to fear; <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 66. 2. They tremble at the Word of God: So did <HI>He|zekiah; Jer.</HI> 26. 18, 19. So did <HI>Jo&s;iah:</HI> and when Judgments come upon the Land, they are greatly affected with the anger of God. But when a people are a carnal people, they don't much mind warnings; many times they make a deri&s;ion of the warnings of the Word; <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 5. 19. <HI>They &s;ay let him make &s;peed and ha&s;ten his work that we may &s;ee it, let the coun&s;el of the Holy One of I&s;rael draw nigh and come, that we may know it.</HI> Godly men would lament upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion; Judg. 2. 4. <HI>When the Angel &s;pake the&s;e words to the Children of I&s;rael, they lift up their voice and wept.</HI> But carnal people don't believe warnings, Jer. 5. 12. <HI>They have belied the Lord, and &s;aid it is not he, neither &s;hall evil come upon us, neither &s;hall we &s;ee &s;word or fa|mine.</HI> Or they think if Judgments do come it will be a good while fir&s;t; Ezek. 12. 27. <HI>They &s;ay the vi&s;ion that he &s;eeth is for many days to come, and he prophe&s;ieth of the things that are far off:</HI> Amos 6. 3. <HI>They put far away the evil day.</HI> Yea, if Judgments do come, many times they are like <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> they don't lay them to heart, unle&s;s they be very heavy, and if they be very heavy, yet they &s;oon for|get them, and the promi&s;es that they made, P&s;al. 78. 37. <HI>They were not &s;tedfa&s;t in his Co|venant.</HI></P>
<P N="7"><PB N="13" REF="001234_0012_0FB182BC6BBC1F08">
7. <HI>They will grow weary of Religious Duties.</HI> Godly men love Religious Duties, P&s;al. 26. 8. <HI>I have loved the habitation of thy hou&s;e, and the place where thine honour dwelleth:</HI> they find a great deal of Comfort in drawing nigh to God, P&s;al. 84. 10. <HI>One day in thy Courts is better then a thou&s;and el&s;e where.</HI> P&s;al. 87. 7. <HI>All my &s;prings are in thee:</HI> Religious Duties &s;uit the new principle that God has put into them: but carnal men grow wea|ry of &s;uch Services: in &s;ome pangs they may delight therein, I&s;a. 58. 2. <HI>They ask of me the Ordinances of ju&s;tice, and take delight in approaching to God.</HI> But generally they grow weary after a while; for their hearts are &s;et upon other things, and &s;o duties are a burden to them, Amos 8. 5. <HI>When will the new Moon be gone, that we may &s;ell corn, and the Sabbath that we may &s;et forth wheat.</HI> They don't meet with God in Religious Duties, and &s;o they are empty things to them: they don't reli&s;h them, hence they are weary of them, and if they mu&s;t attend them, they had rather do it in &s;uch a way as has a pretty deal of Ceremony in it, then in a more Spiritual way.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Many of their Leading men will be Carnal men.</HI> The People mu&s;t take up with &s;uch

And they will have &s;ome carnal Men for Magi&s;trates, and they will help forward the corruption very much: they will give bad examples, they will have re&s;pect to per&s;ons; they will be very dull in the matter of Reformation: Neh. 3. 5. <HI>Their Nobles put not their necks to the work of the Lord.</HI> So &s;ome of the Mini&s;ters will be carnal men: and though generally they Preach &s;ound Doctrine, yet they have not experience of the ways of God: and they want zeal in the cau&s;e of God. They don't rightly under&s;tand the work of Regenerati|on, and are very dead and flat in their Mi|ni&s;try. As the Scribes were; <HI>it is &s;aid Chri&s;t Je&s;us taught with authority and not as the Scribes,</HI> Matth. 7. <HI>ult.</HI> And they make others to <HI>Stum|ble at the Law,</HI> Mal. 2. 8. So other leading men in the Church and in the Town will be carnal men. Some that are aged, and of good under&s;tanding, and good E&s;tates, and have a great &s;way in Publick affairs are but carnal men; and that helps forward the corruption of a People: they won't do what they might to promote the building of Gods Hou&s;e, or to reform the place: if they would joyn with the Mini&s;ter, they might do great Service, but they have not a Spirit to do it: they clog and hinder a great deal of good work which would go forward, if they did heartily a&s;&s;i&s;t therein.</P>
