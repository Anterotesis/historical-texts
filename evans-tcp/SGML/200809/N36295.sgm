<HEAD>Fatal Effects of Jealou&s;y.</HEAD>
<P>DON RAMIRO had been brought up in his infancy with young I&s;abella Mendo&s;a, who was de&s;tined to be his wife. He loved her from a child. His pa&s;&s;ion for her increa&s;ed with his years, and grew &s;tronger with his rea&s;on. He was too amiable a per&s;on not to be beloved. I&s;abella re|quited tenderne&s;s for her with the &s;incere&s;t re|turn; and every thing promi&s;ed the two lovers all they wi&s;hed for, when cruel fortune made them &s;uffer the &s;evere&s;t trials.</P>
<P>The Count de St. E&s;tevan &s;aw I&s;abella, and fell in love with her to di&s;traction: He believed too, that, if he did but a&s;k the con&s;ent of her parents, he &s;hould ea&s;ily obtain her in marriage; for he was rich, had an honorable po&s;t at court, was of a very ancient family; and, as &s;uch con&s;iderable ad|vantages pleaded in his favor, he actually made a propo&s;al to I&s;abella's parents to marry her; but he had not the an&s;wer which he expected. The
<PB N="6" REF="047415_0004_1023A0D8F793BCC8">
Marquis de Mendo&s;a &s;aid, "He had long &s;ince promi&s;ed his daughter to Don Ramiro, and that he could not prevail on him&s;elf to break his word, were the offer made to him ever &s;o advantage|ous.</P>
<P>This denial was a &s;en&s;ible mortification to the Count de St. E&s;tevan, but did not daunt him. The impatience of obtaining a good thing which if refu&s;ed to us renders it precious to us, and the heart is never in a greater flutter than when it is agitated with the fear of lo&s;ing the object with which it is charmed. The Count laid his &s;cheme to intere&s;t the court in his favor, and hoped that the Marquis de Mendo&s;a, who he knew was a crafty politician would alter his purpo&s;e, as &s;oon as he &s;aw it would be plea&s;ing to the Prince upon the throne. He &s;et his friends at work, and car|ried his point.&mdash;The King ordered one of his Mini&s;ters to &s;peak to the Marquis in the Count's favor. The Marquis immediately returned the &s;ame an&s;wer which he had given to the fir&s;t pro|po&s;al of it; but it was conceived in &s;uch terms as made the Mini&s;ter believe it was not impo&s;&s;ible but he might at length comply with his de&s;ire. The view of the Marquis was that of an old Courtier. He was for enhancing the value of the &s;acrifice that was demanded of him. He was &s;en&s;ible that if he made no conce&s;&s;ion to the Mi|ni&s;ter, and appeared at the &s;ame time in a per|plexity how to act, the King would &s;peak to him about the affair him&s;elf.</P>
<P>As he fore&s;aw, &s;o it happened. The King &s;poke to him in favor of the Count de St. E&s;te|van, and urged the matter very home. The
<PB N="7" REF="047415_0005_1023A0DB8D022B70">
crafty Courtier &s;eemed to be in great tribulation, yet put on a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive air, and made an&s;wer, "That he thought his Maje&s;ty did him too great an honor by conde&s;cending to intere&s;t him&s;elf in the concerns of his family." "I am much plea|&s;ed, (&s;aid the King) with your obedience, and will take care you &s;hall find your account by it in due time and place." The&s;e la&s;t words compleat|ed the misfortunes of the unhappy Don Ramiro. From that very in&s;tant the Marquis was re&s;olv|ed to &s;acrifice him to his ambition. He thought him&s;elf the propere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> per&s;on to acquaint him of his misfortune, and took all the care po&s;&s;ible to &s;weeten the bitter pill: Therefore, before he di&s;covered the matter to him, he made a long &s;peech upon the &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity that per&s;ons attach|ed to the court were under of conforming to the de&s;ires of their Prince. In &s;hort, he told Don Ramiro, that, by an order from court, he mu&s;t re&s;ign all thoughts of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing I&s;abella. Don Ramiro's a&s;toni&s;hment as well as &s;orrow was &s;uch that he could make no an&s;wer. There are &s;ome &s;ituations &s;o di&s;maying, that the rejection of the heart throws a &s;udden cloud over the under&s;tand|ing; and then both &s;eem alike in&s;en&s;ible, becau&s;e the grief with which they are affected takes too deep root for them to give outward marks of it, and the &s;oul mu&s;t have &s;ome time to recover a power of acting. Don Ramiro came to him&s;elf again, and looking &s;ternly at the Marquis de Mendo&s;a. "I thought, (&s;aid he) that the re|peated and &s;olemn promi&s;es you made to me would have been my &s;ure protection from the injury which you now do me. You de&s;ire me never to
<PB N="8" REF="047415_0006_1023A0DDECF8AA30">
think more of I&s;abella: You endeavor to per&s;uade me that you are forced to obey the King: but are you not I&s;abella's father, and con&s;equently is &s;he not at your di&s;po&s;al? The King is ju&s;t, and, if you had but repre&s;ented to him that you could not in honor break your engagement with me, he would not have required of you to commit an ac|tion that would &s;tain your reputation."</P>
<P>Don Ramiro was going on in this &s;train, but the har&s;h terms he made u&s;e of gave &s;uch a &s;hock to the vanity of the Marquis, that with a &s;corn|ful air, he returned him a rough an&s;wer, and left him abruptly. He was &s;o exa&s;perated again&s;t him, that he was no &s;ooner alone but he ordered his daughter to be &s;ent for. He had not yet in|formed her of her misfortune, becau&s;e he tho't it proper to have that previous conver&s;ation with Don Ramiro. The moment I&s;abella appeared before him, he &s;aid to her, with &s;ome &s;harpne&s;s, "Daughter&punc; I make no doubt but you have the love and re&s;pect for me that you owe to me. You mu&s;t, this moment give me a &s;ub&s;tantial proof of it, by renouncing Don Ramiro. The King com|mands me to di&s;po&s;e of you to the Count de St. E&s;tevan; and what I demand of you is, that you look upon Don Ramiro as a man that I hate, and one that has offended me." I&s;abella was &s;o ter|rified at the thoughts of her de&s;tiny, that &s;he could not help uttering her complaints, though it was at the hazard of di&s;gu&s;ting her father. When misfortunes are come to a certain pitch, they in|&s;pire the weake&s;t &s;ouls with courage; and the pro&s;pect of lo&s;ing all that is dear to us is general|ly attended with a re&s;olution to run all ri&s;q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">es
<PB N="9" REF="047415_0007_1023A0DF87F3F320">
for pre&s;erving it. "Were you to di&s;approve of my tears ever &s;o much, &s;aid I&s;abella, permit me, dear father, to vent them in abundance. If I am unfortunate, it cannot be owing to any cau&s;e, but the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion I always paid to your commands. I &s;carce knew what I was before you brought me acquainted with Don Ramiro; you di&s;po&s;ed of my heart in his favour; you de&s;ired I would give it up to him entirely. You told me day after day that you &s;hould judge of my obedience to you by the degree of love which I entertained for him. You commanded me to con&s;ider him as a &s;pou&s;e, that ought to be the dearer to me, becau&s;e he was of your own ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ing. Alas! could I di&s;pute or|ders that were &s;o po&s;itive? Could I foresee that you would one day be so cruel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to revoke them? I have pur&s;ued, nay, intirely abandoned my&s;elf to the inclinations with which you in&s;pired me; I have only lived, for &s;everal years pa&s;t, in hopes of having a &s;pou&s;e in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Ramiro, who&s;e adre&s;&s;es, complai&s;ance, and amiable qualities, have de&s;erv|ed all my love. And would you now require me, that I &s;hould forget him all at once, and pluck that image out of my heart, which you your&s;elf have engraved in it? Oh! father, by the&s;e knees of your's, which I now embrace, recall an order which is death to me. Take pity of an unhappy daughter, who has not de&s;erved to be &s;o, and who&s;e misfortunes it is in your power to put an end to. You gave me life: was it to render it mi&s;erable? You make me no an&s;wer, you look another way. Alas! father, let me therefore ex|pire at your feet, and thereby put a period to the
<PB N="10" REF="047415_0008_1023A0E11069CC28">
cruel &s;ituation in which you have ca&s;t me. You know how dearly I love Don Ramiro. You know the affection and e&s;teem I have for your&s;elf. You demand, that I &s;hould recall my heart from Don Ramiro: What would you have me do in this &s;ad dilemma? Being reduced as I am to the hard ne|ce&s;&s;ity of failing in my duty to you, or betraying my lover; death is the only re&s;ource I have left."</P>
<P>"Your ob&s;tinacy, replied the Marquis, de&s;erves to be puni&s;hed, and I ought to make you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> my authority, that you may learn the better to con|troul your inclination. I will leave you a little longer time to indulge your grief, after which I'll be obeyed, and admit of no farther plea. The Count de St. E&s;tevan &s;hall pay you a vi&s;it; and prepare your&s;elf to receive him as a per&s;on for whom you are allotted."</P>
<P>The&s;e la&s;t words completed. I&s;abella's de&s;pair, and her grief was almo&s;t turned of fury; but it was checked by the pre&s;ence of her father, tho' it did not hinder her from di&s;covering how deeply &s;he was in love. "No, &s;aid &s;he, father, I can|not re&s;olve to abandon Don Ramiro, Exert all the authority you have over me; make me feel the effects of your indignation: I am ready to &s;ub|mit to every thing; and, &s;ince I am come to a re|&s;olution not to obey the will of a father whom I adore, I fear not the wor&s;t that can happen, but look upon it as a trifle, in compari&s;on with the object which has made you hate me."</P>
<P>The Marquis, perceiving his daughter inflexible, was re&s;olved to act with &s;everity, "Well then, &s;aid he, &s;ince you will not obey me, I will find ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="11" REF="047415_0009_1023A0E3F200FAC8">
a way to prevent you from &s;eeing Don Ramiro. I give you twenty-four hours time to determine your choice, either of the Count de St. E&s;tevan, or a Convent." "The mo&s;t cruel impri&s;onment, replied I&s;abella, will be a plea&s;ure to me, as it will &s;ave me from the horrid fate of being the wife of any other man in the world, if I cannot have Don Ramiro." "Withdraw, replied the Marquis, I begin to be out of patience with your ob&s;tinacy, and you tre&s;pa&s;s too far upon my forbearance." I&s;abella retired from her father's apartment to her own, to give full vent to her grief.</P>
<P>Nature has certain prerogatives, which the harde&s;t hearts cannot re&s;i&s;t. When the Marquis de Mendo&s;a was left alone, he could not but feel the &s;ecret reproach of his con&s;cience for the bar|barity with which he had treated his daughter; but this remor&s;e of his, though there was &s;o ju&s;t an occa&s;ion for it, did not la&s;t long. I&s;abella was ignorant, in the mean time, whether Don Rami|ro was a &s;harer in her trouble. Her father had not let her into the &s;ecret of his di&s;gu&s;t with him, nor did &s;he know the occa&s;ion of the enmity be|twixt two per&s;ons that were &s;o dear to her. Though &s;he could not &s;peak to her lover, &s;he re|&s;olved to write to him. She acquainted him of the injunction laid upon her not to &s;ee him any more, and painted her condition with all its hor|rors. The dome&s;tic who carried her letter brought back an an&s;wer to it. She then perceiv|ed &s;he was unfortunate to the la&s;t degree. Don Ramiro, conjured her, by the love &s;he had for him, not to forget him; and a&s;&s;ured her, that his
<PB N="12" REF="047415_0010_1023A0EAB477A400">
life was in her hands, and that he would hold it by no other tenure than her con&s;tancy.</P>
<P>Don Ramiro's grief was no &s;mall addition to I&s;abella's How to alter her condition &s;he could not devi&s;e; nothing occurred to her thoughts, but what was gloomy and a afflicting; yet &s;he ima|gined a convent was the be&s;t place, for there &s;he hoped to receive tidings from Don Ramiro, with more ea&s;e than &s;he could at home; At lea&s;t &s;he was &s;ure of not being teazed by the Count de St. E&s;tevan, whom &s;he looked upon as the only cau&s;e of her misfortunes. She had al&s;o &s;ome faint hopes, that, in time her father might alter his mind. How great &s;oever the perplexity of the mind is, yet, till the evil is apprehended actually happens, there always remains &s;ome glimmer of hope. The under&s;tanding and the heart, which are &s;o often at variance in good fortune, unite their for|ces in adver&s;ity, to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other.</P>
<P>I&s;abella, being re&s;olved to go into a convent, did not think it proper to &s;tay for another melan|choly conver&s;ation with her father. She imparted her de&s;ign to one of the women of her bed-cham|ber, and, having contrived a way to leave the hou&s;e without being perceived, &s;he &s;tepped into a coach that waited for her, and drove to an Ab|bey, where the Abbe&s;s was her intimate friend and relation.</P>
<P>When the Marquis de Mendo&s;a heard that I&s;a|belly was gone off, he po&s;ted with his complaint to the King, not &s;o much out of a fondne&s;s to &s;ee his daughter, as to convince the Sovereign of the vigour with which he had acted in obedience to his orders. When he &s;poke to him he exaggera|ted
<PB N="13" REF="047415_0011_1023A0EC408865F8">
the &s;truggle he had within his brea&s;t to &s;ur|mount a fatherly tenderne&s;s, and concluded by a&s;&s;uring him that he was too &s;en&s;ible how much it was his duty to conform to his intentions, to &s;uf|fer him&s;elf to he bia&s;&s;ed by the tears of his daugh|ter. The King &s;eemed plea&s;ed with the conduct of the Marquis, yet he was not willing that the &s;anctuary which I&s;abella had cho&s;en &s;hould be vi|olated: "She'll be weary, (&s;aid he to the Mar|quis) of &s;uch a melancholy retirement; and you will find her hereafter more tractable, and more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to your commands."</P>
<P>The Marquis overjoyed that he had made his court &s;o well, thought of nothing now but how to break off all corre&s;pondence betwixt his daugh|ter and Don Ramiro. He petitioned the court that the Abbe&s;s might be obliged to receive a wo|man into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he convent that was a creature of his, in order that she might be a &s;py upon I&s;abella. His &s;uit was granted, and the nuns were ordered to prevent any corre&s;pondence between Don Ramiro and I&s;abella.</P>
<P>The Count de St. E&s;tevan was too much in love with her, not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o to be offended at the aver&s;ion &s;he di&s;covered to him. He was not ignorant of the cau&s;e of it; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> man but he would have thought of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">king off a pa&s;&s;ion which could not but render him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">appy: but he was too vain and pre&s;umptuous to think to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. He thought it impo&s;&s;ible but that I&s;abella mu&s;t fall in love with him &s;ooner or later. His birth and his riches had made him intolerably conceited; and he was likewi&s;e ob&s;tinate, pa&s;&s;ionate and Jealous. He &s;ent to I&s;abella &s;everal times to de&s;ire &s;he
<PB N="14" REF="047415_0012_1023A0EDC81B5CF8">
would give him leave to vi&s;it her at the grate; but &s;he always refu&s;ed him, and not without &s;corn. The&s;e marks of hatred and contempt ex|a&s;perated the Count, who was now re&s;olved to ha&s;ten his marriage, and to prepare for removing every ob&s;tacle that oppo&s;ed it. His vanity was &s;o offended, that it made him con&s;ider I&s;abella's charms with no other view than to render him unhappy; and he was &s;o ba&s;e a man as to enter|tain a de&s;ire of marrying her as much out of &s;pite as love. After he had con&s;idered with him&s;elf a long while what cour&s;e he &s;hould take to accom|pli&s;h his de&s;ign he thought of none &s;o expedient as that of removing Don Ramiro at a good di&s;tance from I&s;abella; which, how difficult &s;oever, he did not think impo&s;&s;ible: Fortune favored him, a few days after this re&s;olution, with an opportu|nity which he could not have flattered him&s;elf with the hopes of.</P>
<P>Don Ramiro had found means, notwith&s;tand|ing the Marquis de Mendo&s;a's precautions, and the vigilence of the woman whom he had placed in the convent to be a &s;py upon her, to write to I&s;abella, and to receive letters from her. This corre&s;pondence had la&s;ted &s;ome weeks. The nun, who was her confident, being very much pre&s;&s;ed to it by Don Ramiro, propo&s;ed to I&s;abella to &s;ee him in private, and gave her &s;uch hopes of the &s;ucce&s;s of the a&s;&s;ignation, that she could not with|&s;tand her longings to &s;ee the lover from whom &s;he was parted. It was agreed that Don Ramiro &s;hould come in the night time, over &s;uch a part of the garden walls as was not &s;o high as the re&s;t, and return after his vi&s;it the &s;ame way. In &s;hort,
<PB N="15" REF="047415_0013_1023A0EF902CABB8">
every thing &s;eemed to be &s;o well concerted, that 'twas thought impo&s;&s;ible for any accident to de|feat it.</P>
<P>Don Ramiro, having received the letter where|by I&s;abella advertis'd him of the time and place of repairing to the garden, did not fail of go|ing thither according to the appointment; but as his ill luck would have it, when he was got upon the wall, he was di&s;covered by a per&s;on who was walking with two &s;ervants behind him, in the &s;treet next to the garden. This per&s;on was a par|ty too much concerned to know who was got in|to the convent to leave any &s;tone <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">turned for &s;topping him. Therefore he &s;ent for the watch, and po&s;ted it at the very place where he imagined Don Ramiro was to come back. After he had made this di&s;po&s;ition, the Count de St. E&s;tevan, for he was the per&s;on, &s;ent to acquaint the nuns that there was a man in the garden.</P>
<P>The time which it nece&s;&s;arily took up to get the convent open in the night, gave Don Ramiro lei&s;ure to fall at the feet of his dear I&s;abella, and to &s;ay the tendere&s;t things to her in the phra&s;e of a lover. She, in her turn a&s;&s;ured him that no|thing could rend him from her heart, and that &s;he had rather live and die in a convent than become the wife of the Count de St. E&s;tevan.</P>
<P>While the&s;e two lovers little thinking of the fre&s;h misfortune that threatened them, were giv|ing each other the mo&s;t reciprocal marks of their love, they heard a confu&s;ed noi&s;e in the convent, which obliged them to &s;eparate. Don Ramiro ha&s;tened to make his retreat over the wall; but no &s;ooner was he got down, than the men who
<PB N="16" REF="047415_0014_1023A0F41DEAB4E8">
had been po&s;ted there for the purpo&s;e ru&s;hed up|on him, and, without giving him time to prepare for his defence, took away his &s;word, and then in the King's name charged him to follow them. The Captain of the watch cau&s;ed him to be com|mitted afterwards to pri&s;on, and drew up an in|formation again&s;t him, which he laid next day be|fore the Solicitor General.</P>
<P>The Count de St. E&s;tevan, though the &s;ole author of the misfortune that happened to Don Ramiro, did not appear to have had any hand in it; for the man he had &s;ent for the watch, and he who gave notice to the nuns, were both un|known. It was mere accident that brought the Count into this &s;treet, ju&s;t as Don Ramiro was clambering the wall; and it was jealou&s;y which made him believe that it could be no body but his rival. He knew of what importance it was to get him arre&s;ted, and imagined now that his ruin was unavoidable, the violation of the walls of a con|vent being in Spain a capital crime. His de&s;ign &s;ucceeded but too well. The lawyers prepared his indictment, and the death of Don Ramiro was next to a certainty. He had not a word to plead in his excu&s;e, and he had the po&s;itive evidence of all tho&s;e who had taken him. This affair was the talk of the whole city of Madrid, where Don Ramiro was generally beloved; All men of hon|our pitied him, and &s;olicited for him, but &s;carce hoped for any &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;orrowful I&s;abella was almo&s;t di&s;tracted, and reproached her&s;elf that &s;he had been the cau&s;e of the ruin of her lover. The melancholy to which &s;he abandoned her&s;elf was &s;uch, that
<PB N="17" REF="047415_0015_1023A0F838D3DA00">
her friends dreaded it would put a period to her days. Her father the Marquis de Mendo&s;a was alarmed at it; and the Count de St. E&s;tevan who was informed of it by a nun he had bribed, ima|gined that I&s;abella would not long &s;urvive Don Ramiro. He had too great an affection for her to &s;eek her de&s;truction, and re&s;olved to employ his own and his friends credit to &s;ave Don Rami|ro's life. He had hitherto done every thing that was in his power underhand, to ruin him; and though he now left off his intrigues, yet he was &s;till in hopes of making his rival's misfortune &s;ub|&s;ervient to his purpo&s;e of obtaining I&s;abella. He imparted his de&s;ign to the Marquis de Mendo&s;a, and made him &s;en&s;ible that it would not be impo&s;|&s;ible to procure a pardon for Don Ramiro, pro|vided that I&s;abella would forget him. The Marquis approved of the Count's propo&s;al, and promi&s;ed to &s;peak of it to his daughter. He re|paired to the convent, and having &s;ent for his daughter, de&s;ired to &s;peak with her alone. The grief with which you are oppre&s;&s;ed, &s;aid he, melts my heart into compa&s;&s;ion, and I will, if po&s;&s;ible, put a &s;top to it. You dread the thoughts of Don Ramiro's death; you reproach your&s;elf with be|ing the cau&s;e of the &s;entence which is &s;oon to be pa&s;&s;ed upon him, while it is in your power not only give him life but to re&s;tore him to liberty. "Alas! my father, cried I&s;abella, if Don Rami|ro is to live, I am happy indeed! What, &s;hall I be &s;o fortunate as to pluck him from the unhap|py fate that attends him? Can I pre&s;erve that life to him which he is to lo&s;e through my im|prudence?
<PB N="18" REF="047415_0016_1023A0F9C5DE9FE0">
Nay, can I al&s;o re&s;tore him to liber|ty with life?

an&s;wer, father; what have I done to de&s;erve this har&s;hne&s;s with which you ca&s;t me down?"</P>
<P>"Daughter, (replied the Marquis, at the &s;ame time that he rai&s;ed up I&s;abella from her knees) it is not from anger that I do not make you an an|&s;wer; it is becau&s;e I have nothing to &s;ay for your comfort, as glad as I &s;hould be to a&s;&s;uage your grief and to &s;ave Don Ramiro. Your hand is the price of his life, and upon no other condition can his pardon be granted. He will be indebted for it to the Count de St. E&s;tevan, who by his marriage with you takes upon him to obtain it of the King, though his Maje&s;ty has refu&s;ed it to all others who have &s;olicited it. The time is very pre&s;&s;ing, and perhaps when you would be glad to &s;ave Don Ramiro's life it may be too late: His &s;entence is ju&s;t ready to be pa&s;&s;ed; after which it will not not be po&s;&s;ible to prevent the execution of it. If his life be as dear to you as you &s;ay it is, ha&s;ten to &s;ave it."&mdash;" If it be dear to me! repli|ed I&s;abella, good God! can you &s;o much as doubt of it? Have you not taken &s;ufficient care to en|dear him to me? You opened that frightful aby&s;s into which you have now plunged me, when I was but an infant. Since it mu&s;t be &s;o, I am re|&s;olved to peri&s;h: I will die and Don Ramiro will follow me to the grave. He has too great an af|fection for me to take it ami&s;s of me that I did not &s;ave a life which he could not &s;pend with me." "Very well, replied the Marquis, with &s;ome bitterne&s;s, your ob&s;tinacy will meet with its due reward; and, &s;ince you are willing that Don Ramiro &s;hall die, you &s;hall have your de&s;ire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> I will go my&s;elf to ha&s;ten it, and to demand ju&s;tice

for the offront he has put upon me, and the in|delible &s;tain with which he has di&s;graced you. I will join i&s;&s;ue with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> nuns who pro&s;ecute him, and animate all that &s;eek his ruin." The Mar|quis had no &s;ooner &s;aid this than he was retiring; but I&s;abella cried out to him with a faint and al|mo&s;t dying voice, "Stay, father, &s;tay, Don Ramiro's life mu&s;t be &s;aved: no <HI>I</HI> cannot con|&s;ent that he &s;hould peri&s;h; <HI>I</HI> could not have con|ceived the horror that <HI>I</HI> felt, ju&s;t as you was go|ing to part from me; all the misfortunes that op|pre&s;s me are nothing to my angui&s;h at the view of his approaching death, but how much more &s;hould <HI>I</HI> &s;uffer by his death it&s;elf? Save Don Ramiro's life, <HI>I</HI> will obey." At the&s;e words I&s;abella fainted away. The Marquis called for per&s;ons to relieve her, who, with great difficulty brought her to her&s;elf; and then &s;he de&s;ired to be carried to her chamber.</P>
<P>The Marquis &s;atisfied with his daughter's pro|mi&s;e, was not much concerned at her fainting fit, in which he thought there was no great danger, but looked on it as the la&s;t &s;truggle of a pa&s;&s;ion, which her marriage with the Count de St. E&s;tevan would quickly &s;mother; and he went to carry him the news of his daughter's con&s;ent. The Count, overjoyed, that his project had &s;ucceeded &s;o well, put his friends upon employing their intere&s;t at court; and the King granted Don Ramiro a par|don: But before it was delivered to him, St. E&s;|tevan was for concluding his marriage. The un|fortunate I&s;abella was accordingly married to Don Ramiro's mortal enemy, whom yet the con&s;idered as his deliverer. The &s;ervice which &s;he imagined
<PB N="21" REF="047415_0019_1023A1022817BF88">
the Count had done Don Ramiro, rendered him le&s;s hateful in her eyes, and honour made her re|&s;olve to do every thing in her power to &s;tifle a pa&s;&s;ion, which, after her marriage, &s;he thought would be criminal. Nay, &s;he was determined to try, by all means, to rai&s;e her affection for a hu&s;|band to whom &s;he had only been married by com|pul&s;ion.</P>
<P>Don Ramiro had heard nothing of all this in his pri&s;on, where he was abandoned to the mo&s;t melancholy ideas. He wi&s;hed his Judges would ha&s;ten the moment of his death, and the thought of its being near at hand was the only comfort he had, at the time that the news was brought him that the king had &s;igned his pardon. At fir&s;t he imagined that I&s;abella's fate could not be un|happy, &s;ince his own was &s;o much mended; and this &s;ingle thought was no &s;mall addition to his joy. Now then, &s;aid he, I will revi&s;it the ado|rable I&s;abella. I hope to have leave to die at her feet, and to atone for the misfortunes that <HI>I</HI> have brought upon her. "<HI>I</HI> advi&s;e you, &s;aid the per|&s;on who brought him his pardon, to avoid I&s;abel|la's company; &s;he will but increa&s;e your trou|bles." "No, no &s;aid Don Ramiro, bluntly interrupting him, <HI>I</HI> make no account of life but to &s;ee, to love, and to adore, I&s;abella. If I were to renounce her, the pardon granted to me would be a cruel puni&s;hment." "But what hopes, re|plied the per&s;on can you have now? For &s;ince &s;he is married"&mdash;"What! married! &s;aid Don Ramiro. Ah! then <HI>I</HI> mu&s;t die." His &s;orrow making his &s;peech faulter, he was quite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">unk un|der the weight of his misfortune.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="047415_0020_1023A103E1A77698">
In this &s;tate Don Ramiro remained for near a quarter of an hour; but, &s;orrow having at length recalled his &s;oul to it&s;elf, his dejection was &s;oon &s;ucceeded by rage. "What! &s;aid he, has I&s;a|bella betrayed me? Has that I&s;abella, who&s;e heart I always thought full of tenderne&s;s for me abandoned me? Has &s;he even married my rival? Ah! cruel one, I will di&s;appoint you, and you &s;hall no longer fea&s;t your eyes with the grief of a lover whom you have drove to de&s;pair."</P>
<P>The per&s;on who had acquainted Don Ramiro with I&s;abella's marriage, not thinking that this news would have had &s;uch an effect upon him, endeavoured to pacify him by a vindication of I|&s;abella's conduct. He knew that this amiable young lady only con&s;ented to marry the Count, in order to &s;ave Don Ramiro's life; he therefore gave him a particular detail of what his unfortu|nate mi&s;tre&s;s had &s;uffered, and of the nece&s;&s;ity &s;he was reduced to of giving her hand to the Count de St. E&s;tevan for that very purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Don Ramiro ob&s;erved a pen&s;ive &s;ilence during the narrative of his dear I&s;abella's misfortunes, and his rage, by degrees&punc; abated. Every token of his mi&s;tre&s;s's love made that impre&s;&s;ion upon his heart which rea&s;on operates on a mind that is &s;omewhat di&s;turbed. At length, the pa&s;&s;ion which he had for I&s;abella having recovered intire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his &s;oul, he cried out, in a plaintive tone, "Alas! Why has &s;he loved me to &s;uch a degree! Or rather, why did &s;he not let me die? What &s;hall I do with a life that I &s;o much hate?"</P>
<P>While Don Ramiro was thus complaining, the officers of ju&s;tice came to &s;et him at liberty. He
<PB N="23" REF="047415_0021_1023A10895730720">
was &s;o afflicted, that he made them no an&s;wer, but went out with them, plunged in deep medi|tation, and, at the bottom of the &s;teps of the pri&s;on in which he had been confined, found a coach, which carried him home. He no &s;ooner &s;et down, than he wrote a letter to I&s;abella, com|plaining of his hard lot; but her an&s;wer made him more unea&s;y than before. He &s;aw that &s;he had &s;till the &s;ame kindne&s;s for him; he was fully &s;en&s;ible of the &s;acrifice which &s;he had made to &s;ave his life, yet this &s;ame I&s;abella was he obliged to &s;hun; and death, which he thought the only remedy for his misfortunes, was not permitted him. In this &s;ad &s;ituation Don Ramiro re&s;olved to indulge melancholy till it put an end to his mi&s;|fortunes, and in this way did he live for above three months, when a man, altogether unknown to him, de&s;ired to &s;peak with him. "<HI>I</HI> come, Sir, &s;aid he, to reveal a &s;ecret to you, which it highly concerns you to know. I was many years a dome&s;tic of the Count de St. E&s;tevan, and it is not above a month &s;ince I left his &s;ervice, <HI>I</HI> am now going to leave Madrid; el&s;e &s;ooner or later, I &s;hall feel the Counts re&s;entment. Shall I tell you the very thing that has pu&s;hed him to ruin me? He is afraid le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t I &s;hould acquaint you, that it was he who di&s;covered you when you got over into the convent. He has always per&s;ecuted you &s;ince; and, while you was in pri&s;on, I went with him very often, to &s;everal of your judges, whom he &s;olicited to ruin you. It is true he had a hand in procuring your pardon, when your mi&s;tre&s;s had con&s;ented to marry him. I hope you will not &s;uffer the &s;ecret I tell you to be divulged be|fore
<PB N="24" REF="047415_0022_1023A10C9E1A6FA8">
I am gone from Madrid. Nothing could &s;ave one from his fury if he knew that I had in|formed you of his behaviour, he being in a con|tinual alarm for fear his &s;pou&s;e &s;hould come to the knowledge of it."</P>
<P>While the dome&s;tic was pur&s;uing his narrative, Don Ramiro was in a perfect rage. "The trea|cherous wretch, &s;aid he, &s;hall mo&s;t certainly die; his impo&s;ture &s;hall have its due reward"</P>
<P>Don Ramiro, without delay, prepared to put his menaces into execution. He wrote two let|ters, one to I&s;abella, wherein he told her what her hu&s;band had done, and the other to the Count, inviting him to decide, without any one's privity, a quarrel, for which nothing could put an end, but the death of one of them.</P>
<P>I&s;abella was gone to pay a vi&s;it to her &s;i&s;ter the Marchione&s;s del Prado, when the dome&s;tic deli|vered the letter to the Count. He was nettled at it to the la&s;t degree; and, though he was more bruti&s;h than brave, he was &s;o animated by his pride and re&s;entment, that without waiting for I&s;abella's return, he went out that very moment alone to the place appointed. The two antago|ni&s;ts were no &s;ooner met, but without any parley they drew their &s;words and fought furiou&s;ly. They had each received &s;everal wounds, but their rage hindered them from perceiving that they had lo&s;t blood. Don Ramiro vexed at meeting with &s;uch re&s;i&s;tence, from a rival whom he de&s;pi&s;ed as much as he hated, was determined to put an end by one pu&s;h to a duel which had la&s;ted &s;o long, and, making a full pa&s;s at the Count, ran him in|to the brea&s;t; but he received a &s;lab in the bot|tom
<PB N="25" REF="047415_0023_1023A10E25664F70">
of his belly, which was altogether as danger|ous. The&s;e two la&s;t thru&s;ts di&s;abled the two com|batants alike at one and the &s;ame time, and both lo&s;t &s;o much blood that they could no longer &s;tand on their feet, but fell down both together, the moment that a coach came to them.</P>
<P>Who&s;e coach &s;hould this be but I&s;abella's, who, receiving Don Ramiro's letter when &s;he came home, and finding upon enquiry, that her hu&s;|band was gone out alone, made no doubt but he had &s;ome duel on his hands. In her confu&s;ion &s;he happened al&s;o to go into the Count's chamber, and perceived a letter on the table, which, by the hand-writing &s;he gue&s;&s;ed to be Don Ramiro's; and it was indeed the very challenge he had wrote to his rival. I&s;abella needed no farther informa|tion to direct her to the place &s;he was to go to. When &s;he alighted out of the coach. She ran towards her hu&s;band, who hardly knew her, and was &s;o weak, that he could not &s;peak. I&s;abella turned her eyes every now and then to Don Ra|miro, who&s;e condition was altogether as danger|ous. Duty engaged her to &s;upport her hu&s;band, love called her attention to her lover: her care was engaged for the Count, her wi&s;hes for Don Ramiro. She was &s;en&s;ible that &s;he ought that in&s;tant to have carried her hu&s;band to town but then Don Ramiro would have been left without any manner of help. Love prevailed over de|corum, and &s;he &s;taid till her &s;ervants had carried Don Ramiro to a neighbouring convent. The Count, as faint as he was, had &s;en&s;e enough to perceive what rea&s;ons his wife had for not return|ing
<PB N="26" REF="047415_0024_1023A110F0AE3438">
with more &s;peed to Madrid. The&s;e his jea|lou&s;y pointed to him in the blacke&s;t colours, and nothing but his being &s;o faint hindered him from exclaiming again&s;t I&s;abella with the mo&s;t bitter reproaches. The unfortunate Don Ramiro was &s;en&s;ible al&s;o of the obligations which he had to his mi&s;tre&s;s; and, though he &s;poke very low, and though I&s;abella made him no manner of an&s;wer, the Count &s;u&s;pecting that there was an under|&s;tanding between them, and the more he reflect|ed, the more he was confirmed in it; &s;o that during the fir&s;t days of his illne&s;s he thought of nothing el&s;e. His duel was not unknown at court; but, as neither his wounds nor tho&s;e of Don Ra|miro were mortal, ju&s;tice took no cognizance of the matter, and there was no pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Count de St. E&s;tevan had reco|vered &s;pirits to &s;hew his re&s;entment. He rallied I&s;abella with all the &s;harpne&s;s that could be. "I do not know what you mean, replied I&s;abella, and, if you really imagine that I was any way concerned in your duel, you would be the mo&s;t ungenerous of mortals." "Nay, replied the Count in a rage, it was you that fet on Don Ra|miro to attack me. I &s;aw the confu&s;ion of your countenance, when he was wounded. Regardle&s;s whether I lived or died, you thought of nothing but the danger you &s;uppo&s;ed he was in. He could not command his temper enough, not to expre&s;s his grateful &s;en&s;e of it to you before my face: and I &s;aw him thank you for it. My eyes ready to be clo&s;ed for ever, expo&s;ed both my own di&s;grace and yours to me. But would to God I had been

&s;trong enough at that in&s;tant to have &s;tabbed your lover to the heart, and you after him!"</P>
<P>"I am not deaf, &s;aid <HI>I</HI>&s;abella with an Indig|nant air, to the reproaches which you have ca&s;t upon me; reproaches as worthy of you as they are unworthy of me. My virtue defies the blacke&s;t calumney; nor do I fear the &s;lander of the hu&s;band to whom cruel fortune has been plea&s;ed to join me. But, for my own &s;atisfaction, I mu&s;t tell you what perhaps you never yet knew. I loved Don Ramiro from my very infancy. The unhappy pa&s;&s;ion which you entertained for me de|prived me of him for ever. I con&s;ented to mar|ry you in order to &s;ave his life, and re&s;olved from that time to bani&s;h him from my heart; but I perceived that my efforts were vain, and that his image haunted me wherever I went. Mean time I turned my duty into a &s;evere law. Mean time I turned my duty into a &s;evere law. I ordered Don Ramiro to keep out of my &s;ight: <HI>I</HI> lived with you in the be&s;t manner I could; I fell in with every thing that I thought could plea&s;e you, and even wi&s;hed I could love you. When my heart was in &s;o unea&s;y a &s;ituation, I learnt that you was the &s;ole author of my misfortunes, and tho&s;e of Don Ramiro. <HI>I</HI> find that it was you that cau&s;ed him to be apprehended. <HI>B</HI>arbarous as it was; and as much an abhorrence as I have for &s;o &s;hocking a deed, I per&s;evere in my duty, and my virtue is not &s;haken. I found by a letter lying on your table the place appointed for your duel with Don Ramiro. I ran thither to &s;epa|rate you, but could not arrive &s;oon enough. You reproach me for &s;hewing a concern at the condi|tion in which I &s;aw my lover. I was concerned,

no doubt, and am not a&s;hamed to own it. Alas! why &s;hould I not pity a virtuous man; one who is truly worthy of being beloved, and who is un|fortunate for my &s;ake? Thus have you now heard what I had to &s;ay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o you."</P>
<P>At the&s;e words the Counte&s;s went out of her hu&s;band's chamber, and left him &s;eemingly ab&s;orb|ed in a profound reverie. The &s;incere confe&s;&s;ion which &s;he had made put him into &s;uch a &s;tate, that he could not di&s;tingui&s;h right and a wrong. He was &s;mitten with the tokens which I&s;abella had given him of her hone&s;ty and firmne&s;s of mind. He admired her frankne&s;s and &s;incerity; but, on the other hand, his jealous temper inclined him to think, that, as &s;he had an affection for Don Ra|miro, it would not be long before &s;he &s;hook off the yoke of trouble&s;ome virtue, and that the fir&s;t opportunity &s;he would betray him. The affront he had lately put upon her increa&s;ed his apprehen|&s;ion. We commonly judge of others hearts by our own. The wicked imagine that the mo&s;t commendable actions are only artful cloaks for knavery.</P>
<P>Such tormenting thoughts were quickly &s;uc|ceeded by rage, and he re&s;olved to be revenged the very fir&s;t opportunity, both upon I&s;abella and Don Ramiro. He would have been glad to have gone that in&s;tant from Madrid, and to have carri-his &s;pou&s;e to one of his country &s;eats, but his wounds hindered him from &s;etting out as yet. He was therefore under the nece&s;&s;ity of bearing all with patience.</P>
<P>While the Count thought of confining his wife in &s;ome &s;olitary place, far from court, Don Ra|miro

being perfectly cured of his wounds, pre|pared to quit not only Madrid but Spain, and to travel in foreign parts. He had no hopes of find|ing any alleviation of his &s;uffering, while he con|tinued at Madrid. He thought ab&s;ence would be his only relief. Love is excited and animated, more than any pa&s;&s;ion, by the nearne&s;s of its ob|ject.</P>
<P>Don Ramiro was ju&s;t upon &s;etting out for France; but he could not re&s;olve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o quit Spain, without acquainting I&s;abella of it. I&s;abella received his letter, and read it &s;everal times, but not with|out &s;hedding tears. The departure of her lover, is nece&s;&s;ary as &s;he thought it, overwhelmed her|&s;elf with grief. She had been plunged a long time in the&s;e melancholy reflections, when word was brought her that her father was come. She went out of her chamber to receive him, and threw Don Ramiro's letter into a little box upon her toilet. Whether it was that &s;he had not time to lock it, or whether &s;he really forgot it, her hu&s;band coming &s;oon after into her chamber, while &s;he was in another room with her father, had the jealous curio&s;ity to peep into this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ox where he knew I&s;abella &s;ometimes kept her pa|pers. There he found Don Ramiro's letter, which he read and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aid again in its place; but was in &s;uch a violent pa&s;&s;ion, that from that moment he formed a de&s;ign to be the ruin of Don Ramiro, and to &s;ecure his wife in a clo&s;e pri&s;on for her life. Neverthele&s;s he re&s;olved to take no notice till the moment he could work his revenge.</P>

He propo&s;ed to his wife to re|tire to one of his e&s;tates; I&s;abella who only de|&s;ired a &s;olitary retirement from the world, and was the more earne&s;t for it after &s;he had heard of Don Ramiro's journey, readily con&s;ented to her hu&s;band's offer; and &s;he even pre&s;&s;ed him to &s;et out with all &s;peed.</P>
<P>The Marquis de Mendo&s;a who thought differ|ently from his daughter, was very &s;orry to find her going into the country. He only matched her to the Count de St. E&s;tevan, thinking that the rank &s;he would hold at court would make her in&s;trumental to his ambition; but now all his hopes would be fru&s;trated by being deprived of his daughter, and he &s;hould reap no advantage from having made her unhappy. He did what of lay in his power with the Count to hinder from leaving Madrid: but could obtain nothing him. He feared and not without rea&s;on, how pa&s;&s;ionate and jealous he would be, when he was at a di&s;tance from the court and could act with|out any re&s;traint. The&s;e mortifying ideas, which were but too well founded, determined the Mar|quis to place a waiting maid with his daughter on

whom he could depend, and who promi&s;ed to in|form him how I&s;abella fared, and how her hu&s;|band behaved to her.</P>
<P>The Count &s;et out for his e&s;tate, continuing his di&s;&s;imulation, and making no di&s;covery <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it could give I&s;abella the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of the hor|rid de&s;igns which he was contriving, and putting into execution. This barbarian had po&s;ted a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;ins in Don Ramiro's road, who, after having murdered him, were to bring him his heart: but Don Ramiro's good fortune pre&s;erved him from the &s;nares that were laid for him. His valet-de-chambre happening to receive a wound by a fall from his hor&s;e, two leagues from the wood where the ruffians were po&s;ted. Don Ramiro did not care to &s;top, but ordered him to be put into his chai&s;e, and carried gently to the next town: then he mounted his hor&s;e, taking only one footman with him, leaving the other to take care of the valet-de-chambre. The a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, &s;eeing two men pa&s;s by upon a gallop, thought they were Don Ramiro's dome&s;tics going to get po&s;t hor&s;es ready at the next &s;tage. They were overjoyed to think, that the man whom they aimed at was deprived of that a&s;&s;i&s;tance which he might other|wi&s;e have had, and lay concealed in that po&s;t.

<P>Don Ramiro having waited a day for his valet-de-chambre, &s;ent away me&s;&s;engers to learn what was become of him. Having met with the lacky, who as above-mentioned, rode off upon the at+tack of the chai&s;e, they brought him to Don Ra|miro, and it was by his intelligence that he knew of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the po&s;tilion and valet de-chambre. He imagined that tho&s;e who had com|mitted the murder were highwaymen; and after having laid an account of what had happened be|fore the Magi&s;trates, he thought it his be&s;t way not to &s;tay longer, his pre&s;ence for pro&s;ecution for the murder being not nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time that Don Ramiro was travel|ling to Paris, the ruffians who had a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated his valet de-chambre &s;teered their cour&s;e towards the e&s;tate of the Count de St. E&s;tevan, to whom they carried the heart, for which he was exceedingly impatient: for the murder of his rival was but a &s;aint &s;ketch of the horrid projects which he had formed; his raging jealou&s;y having put him upon de&s;igns, attended with the more barbarity and cruelty than that of the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">e&s;t mon&s;ters.

The Count's joy was beyond all mea&s;ure, when he thought him&s;elf rid of his rival. All that vex|ed him was, that the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins had not told Don Ramiro, before they murdered him, that they did it by his order; for he thought his revenge was not compleat, becau&s;e his enemy did not know who &s;truck him.

<P>While I&s;abella was edifying all the Nuns by her behaviour, Don Ramiro heard at Paris that his mi&s;tre&s;s was retired to a Convent, as well as how &s;he came to be &s;eparated from her hu&s;band.

On the other hand, the Count, being no longer apprehen&s;ive of any pro&s;ecution for the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion of Don Ramiro, quitted Li&s;bon, and &s;et out for the abbey to which he was informed his wife had retired.

Don Ramiro, not knowing the rea&s;on of I&s;abella's fainting away, and a&s;cribing it pure|ly to her affection, approached her, and taking her by the hand, &s;aid to her, with a voice which was broken with tears and &s;ighs: "If I had thought, Madam, that my unexpected pre&s;ence would have brought the tragical ideas of your misfortunes &s;o fre&s;h to your remembrance, I would have been more cautions how I made my fir&s;t appearance to you." I&s;abella made no an|&s;wer but fixed her eyes on Don Ramiro; and not with&s;tanding the fright &s;he was in, and her prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion that &s;he &s;aw and heard a gho&s;t, the image of her lover engaged all her attention. She dur&s;t not an&s;wer, but &s;he heard and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">: The force of her love, however, dimini&s;hed that of her fear.</P>
<P>Don Ramiro, being &s;urpri&s;ed to find I&s;abella &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed, and di&s;covering &s;omething in her countenance which betrayed fear, &s;aid to her, looking tenderly on her at the &s;ame time: "What, fair I&s;abella, has time changed your

heart? Am I hateful or indifferent to you? What is become of that love which you was to have re|tained for me, even beyond the grave? Ah! how different has my heart been form your's! nothing has been capable of changing my &s;entiments. They are &s;till the &s;ame. They are as tender as ever."</P>
<P>Fear is like the other pa&s;&s;ions: the &s;econd im|pre&s;&s;ions of it are not &s;o violent as the fir&s;t; and a very little &s;pace of time wears off the force of it. I&s;abella ventured to look upon her lover's image. She afterwards heard him, and had the courage even to attempt to an&s;wer him; for, at the fir&s;t effort &s;he made to &s;peak, her tongue faltered two or three times, but at la&s;t it formed di&s;tinct founds. "Oh! Don Ramiro, &s;aid &s;he, is it po&s;|&s;ible for you to love me &s;o well as to return from the other world to give me proofs of it! Since the dead know the &s;tate of the living, you cannot be ignorant of the tears which I have &s;hed for the lo&s;s of you, and the tenderne&s;s with which I have ever remembered you. Notwith&s;tanding the fright which you have put me in, I con&s;ider this moment that I now &s;ee you again as the hap|pie&s;t of all my life."</P>
<P>No words could expre&s;s Don Ramiro's a&s;ton|i&s;hment. He knew not what to think of I&s;abel|la's di&s;cour&s;e. He was almo&s;t inclined to think that her &s;en&s;es were impaired. "I am not dead, re|plied he, fair I&s;abella; I live, and live only to adore you." I&s;abella &s;urpri&s;ed at Don Ramiro's lan|guage. "You are really alive then, &s;aid &s;he, looking tenderly on him, and my cruel hu&s;band
<PB N="43" REF="047415_0041_1023A2D9DBF04090">
has not committed all the foul crimes which he related to me with as much a&s;&s;urance as cruelty. Oh! dear Ramiro! how many tears have you co&s;t me, and how do I delight to &s;ee you again? You would gue&s;s how great my joy mu&s;t be, if you could but know the mea&s;ure of my pa&s;t &s;or|row." She then gave him an account of her hu&s;band's barbarity. Don Ramiro quickly per|ceived that his life was only owing to the mi&s;take of tho&s;e ruffians who had murdered his valet de chambre, and &s;o great was his rage again&s;t the Count de St. E&s;tevan, that he re&s;olved to go to Li&s;bon and fight a duel with him: nor was he e|ven ma&s;ter enough of his temper to conceal his purpo&s;e from I&s;abella. No, &s;aid I&s;abella, if you have any love for me, I forbid you to fight a duel with my hu&s;band. If I am really dear to you, of which I make no manner of doubt, do not give me rea&s;on to complain of you. Do not &s;tain my honour by a combat, wherein it will be thought that I was concerned. The tears which dropt from I&s;abella's eyes, while &s;he was &s;peaking to Don Ramiro, melted him. The fury which worked in his &s;oul with &s;uch violence was &s;ucceed|ed by a warm tenderne&s;s. When he came to him&s;elf, he was afraid to add to the &s;orrows of his dear mi&s;tre&s;s, and feigned a compliance with every thing &s;he de&s;ired. There are certain cau|&s;es, &s;uch as was this of Don Ramiro, wherein di&s;&s;imulation becomes nece&s;&s;ary to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">over and tho' it appears &s;o oppo&s;ite to true love, it then is a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">.

to keep, &s;aid to him, "I mu&s;t al&s;o de&s;ire another favor of you; which is that you will &s;et out from this abbey with all the &s;peed you can, as your pre&s;ence cannot but be injurious to my re|putation. Farewell, dear Ramiro, it is time that I take my&s;elf from you. I think my afflictions infinitely the lighter, &s;ince you are alive. At the&s;e words I&s;abella, with tears in her eyes, went out of the parlour. Don Ramiro had not &s;trength to make an&s;wer, but he followed her to the gate, took her by the hand, watered it with tears as he ki&s;&s;ed it, and, when he was alone, &s;tepped &s;ome moments longer, quite oppre&s;&s;ed with grief, and without &s;eeming to remember the purpo&s;e he had contrived. But his de&s;ire of puni&s;hing the Count de St. E&s;tevan, quickly raged in him with more violence than before. He was no &s;ooner returned to his quarters, but he ordered his &s;er|vants to get the hor&s;es ready, and &s;et out for Li&s;bon. He had already travelled &s;ix po&s;t miles, when he heard the firing of pi&s;tols, at the en|trance of a wood not far off, through which the great road led. He thought he heard the cry of per&s;ons attacked, and pu&s;hed on to the place from whence the noi&s;e came. He pre&s;ently di&s;covered three per&s;ons &s;toutly de&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ding them&s;elves again&s;t &s;ix others, who &s;urrounded and pre&s;&s;ed on them from every &s;ide. Don Ramiro thought him&s;elf obliged to a&s;&s;i&s;t per&s;ons that were attacked with &s;uch odds, and alighted therefore from his chai&s;e. He was very well &s;econded by his two dome&s;tics; &s;o that one of the highwaymen fell immediately by the point of his &s;word, run in at his &s;tomach,

another died &s;oon after of the wounds he had re|ceived; and the other four &s;eeing the fate of their comrades, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed.</P>
<P>In the heat of the &s;kirmi&s;h, Don Ramiro took no ob&s;ervation of the phy&s;iog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">y of the per&s;ons whom he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted. How great therefore was his &s;urpri&s;e, when, drawing near to the per&s;on who &s;eemed to be the ma&s;ter of the others, and who was &s;o dangerou&s;ly wounded that he could not &s;tand, but was forced to lean again&s;t a tree, he found it was the Count de St. E&s;tevan. His a&s;toni&s;hment was &s;o great that he &s;tared at him without &s;aying one word: The langui&s;hing condi|tion he found him in &s;u&s;pended his animo&s;ity.&mdash;The Count perceiving on his part that his pro|tector was Don Ramiro, &s;eemed almo&s;t as much &s;urpri&s;ed as he, and much more confounded.&mdash;Though he perceived he had not many minutes to live, his jealou&s;y revived; &s;o that he could not di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of a notion that his rival had been to &s;ee I&s;abella; and he was po&s;itive in his mind that &s;he only retired to the abbey, that &s;he might have the more freedom to conver&s;e with him. Rage and fury intirely engro&s;&s;ed his &s;oul and he was re&s;olved to fill up the mea&s;ure of all his iniquities; but he di&s;&s;embled, and concealed his wrath to render the effects of it the more fatal. "I perceive, &s;aid he to Don Ramiro, that it was the will of Heaven that I &s;hould be reconciled to you before I died, and that I &s;hould with my own hand re&s;tore a felicity to you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of which I unju&s;tly robbed you.

neverthele&s;s to engage me to gratitude. I have not many more moments to live; permit me to make you the bearer of my la&s;t will to I&s;abella. I have a right to require it of her; I wi&s;h that &s;he would give her&s;elf to you in marriage. My &s;ervants will tell her, and her father too, of the &s;ervice you have done me: They will be witne&s;&s;es that I die in friend&s;hip with you.

Don Ramiro, &s;eeing his enemy giving up the gho&s;t, and touched with a remor&s;e for the misfortunes he had brought upon I&s;abella, was &s;o generous as to forget the injuries he had done to him&s;elf.

up, to the neare&s;t town, which was that wherein the abbey was &s;ituate. As &s;oon as Don Ramiro was come thither, he &s;ent one of the Count's &s;ervants to acquaint I&s;abella of the &s;ad affair that had happened. Such was her abhorrence of the Count's action, that &s;he could not lament his death; but &s;o great was her affliction to hear that Don Ramiro was dangerou&s;ly wounded, that &s;he could not help going to &s;ee him. She was ju&s;t departing out of the Convent, when &s;he was in|formed that her father the Marquis de Mendo&s;a was arrived, and waited in the parlour to &s;peak with her. She ran to embrace him, and having acquainted him of her hu&s;band's death, and of Don Ramiro's wound, the Marquis cho&s;e to lead her him&s;elf to the man whom he commanded her to regard from that moment as her future &s;pou&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;urgeons had ju&s;t laid on the fir&s;t dre&s;&s;ing of Don Ramiro's wound, when I&s;abella and her fa|ther came to him. He &s;eemed &s;o overjoyed at this favour, that he forgot the evils he had &s;uf|fered. The hopes of being &s;oon perfectly happy by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of I&s;abella, which the Marquis a&s;&s;ured him of, contributed as much as the care of his doctors to his cure, which was compleated in a very little time, as was his marriage with his fair mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
