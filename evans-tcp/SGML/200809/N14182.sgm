<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE author of the following &s;heets doth not mean to detract from the merit of his worthy brethren, who have publi&s;hed on the &s;ame &s;ide of the que&s;tion. He had began before he knew the de&s;ign of others; and upon ob&s;erving that his own plan was different, pur|&s;ued it, de&s;irous of contributing to the extinction of an ancient and generally exploded &s;entiment; and of furni&s;hing an antidote again&s;t the <HI>&s;eem|ingly</HI> malignant poi&s;on of the <HI>OLD SERPENT,</HI> fir&s;t in&s;tilled into the ears of our common mother <HI>Eve,</HI> when he gave the lie to God's threatening and &s;aid unto the woman&mdash;"Ye &s;hall <HI>NOT SURELY DIE.</HI>"</P>
<P>The mental ta&s;tes of men are as various as their animal; and therefore a variety of publi|cations may plea&s;e a much greater number, and by that means do more univer&s;al &s;ervice, than any &s;ingle one however well executed.</P>
<P>The Friend of Truth will never regret, that he &s;tands not <HI>alone</HI> in &s;upport of it. He rejoices, at &s;eeing numbers coming in to the aid of a good cau&s;e. And the author of this performance

hopes, that &s;hould <HI>that</HI> be attacked <HI>afre&s;h,</HI> there will not be wanting tho&s;e who &s;hall offer them|&s;elves willingly to the &s;ervice of the Lord in defence of it; and the more &s;o, as he will pro|bably be prevented by particular engagements of a different nature.</P>
<P><HI>Syriac</HI> was the vulgar language of <HI>Judea</HI> in the days of our Saviour; but with regard to every book of the New Te&s;tament, the pre&s;ump|tion is in favour of its being written in <HI>Greek;</HI> and we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily admit that the Evan|geli&s;ts were divinely influenced to give us the true &s;en&s;e of our Lord's expre&s;&s;ions in the <HI>Greek</HI> words they u&s;ed, which vindicates the repre&s;entation made of them as though uttered by our Lord.</P>
<P>The pamphlet de&s;igned to be an&s;wered is anony|mous; and, whatever may have been whi&s;pered in private circles, it hath never been properly announced to the public, who <HI>compiled</HI> or who <HI>prefaced</HI> it. And it ought to be remembered, that when gentlemen think it eligible to enter into the literary world incog, they are not en|titled to &s;pecial re&s;pect from any excellency of <HI>private</HI> character, but may be fairly treated as though they were wholly <HI>unknown.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE Doctrine of Final Univer&s;al Salvation EXAMINED, And &s;hewn to be un&s;criptural.</HEAD>
<P><HI>INDIFFERENCE</HI> to religious &s;entiments, thought to be of <HI>divine revelation,</HI> however ha&s;tily pro|nounced a proof of candour, catholici&s;m and good &s;en&s;e, mu&s;t, upon mature deliberation, appear little other than an affront to the wi&s;dom of that <HI>Being,</HI> who is &s;uppo&s;ed to have revealed them.</P>
<P>That the writer of the following &s;heets pretends not to &s;uch indifference, cannot be complained of by tho&s;e who are <HI>endeavouring</HI> to &s;pread their own par|ticular tenets, which, though not really novel, are new to the generality of the pre&s;ent generation.</P>
<P>When per&s;ons reject doctrines upon the &s;ole plea of their being new, it is warrantable to convince them of their mi&s;take: but it is not the antiquity or novelty of doctrines, that &s;hould incline us to receive or reject them&mdash;no&mdash;but their being, or not being, contained directly or indirectly in the &s;acred writings. The ap|peal is to be made to <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the <HI>Prophets,</HI> to the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> for it is the Bible that con|tains the religion of <HI>con&s;i&s;tent</HI> Prote&s;tants, and not the writings of <HI>Origen</HI> or <HI>Clement</HI> of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> or any other <HI>unin&s;pired</HI> divine.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="017959_0005_0FA37E7C13748B88">Should it be a&s;&s;erted, that our Lord's words in <HI>Mat|thew,</HI> when he &s;ays, "there be eunuchs who have made them&s;elves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's &s;ake," are to be under&s;tood <HI>literally;</HI> and &s;hould it be brought in proof, that the pious and learned <HI>Origen</HI> ca&s;trated him&s;elf, the argument would produce a &s;neer rather than conviction.</P>
<P>Whoever con&s;ults the fir&s;t volume of the celebrated <HI>Mo&s;heim</HI>'s Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory, will learn from thence, that <HI>Origen</HI> and <HI>Clement</HI> were notorious, for introducing into the church, that "<HI>pagan philo&s;ophy</HI> and <HI>vain deceit,</HI> (alluded to by Dr. <HI>Hartley,</HI> but with a different view) and for mingling them with chri&s;tianity, and &s;o corrupting it."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Salvation for all Men illu&s;trated and vindicated, p. 21.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Clement</HI> of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> who was the praeceptor of <HI>Origen,</HI> flouri&s;hed about the year 206, and lived till towards 220. "His exce&s;&s;ive attachment to the reign|ing philo&s;ophy led him into a variety of pernicious errors."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mo&s;heim, Vol. I. p. 148.</NOTE> <HI>Origen,</HI> who died in the year 254, aged 69, enchanted by the charms of the <HI>Platonic</HI> philo&s;ophy, &s;et it up as the te&s;t of all religion, and imagined that the rea&s;ons of each doctrine were to be found in that favourite philo&s;ophy, and their <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>extent</HI> to be determined by it."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mo&s;heim, Vol. I. p. 221.</NOTE></P>
<P>But to di&s;mi&s;s <HI>Clement</HI> and <HI>Origen,</HI> and attend to <HI>Jeremiah White,</HI> chaplain to <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> who is honoured with the epithets of <HI>pious, ingenious</HI> and <HI>excel|lent.</HI> If the&s;e epithets are <HI>de&s;igned</HI> to bias the mind and prejudice the reader, in favour of the chaplain's rea&s;oning, it mu&s;t be imputed to weakne&s;s or craft; but whether lay-craft or prie&s;t-craft is immaterial to the ca&s;e in hand. That the chaplain was ingenious will appear from the following anecdote, which will
<PB N="3" REF="017959_0006_0FA37E7CBA781FD8">
al&s;o prove at the &s;ame in&s;tant, that <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> was &s;till more ingenious. <HI>Jerry</HI> while in a &s;tate of celibacy was ambitious of matrimonial connexions with his ma&s;ter's daughter, and laboured privately to gain her affections. <HI>Oliver</HI> obtained information of it, and, watching the opportunity, enters abruptly into the room where <HI>Jerry</HI> was upon his knees before his <HI>Dulcinia.</HI> The &s;ight of him in &s;uch a po&s;ture led <HI>Cromwell</HI> to a&s;k the rea&s;on of it. <HI>Jerry</HI> ingeniou&s;ly an&s;wered, that he was be&s;eeching her lady&s;hip to intercede on his behalf, that he might obtain one of her maids of honour (mentioning the name) in marriage. <HI>O!</HI> crys the more ingenious ma&s;ter, <HI>is that all! Well! I will help you out of your difficulty;</HI> and immediately &s;ummoned the un&s;u&s;pecting innocent maid into his pre&s;ence, enjoined her compliance with the wi&s;h of the chaplain, and then &s;aw to it, that it was &s;o and the parties married.</P>
<P>But if <HI>Oliver's</HI> Chaplain was ever &s;o pious, ingenious and excellent, what is that to the purpo&s;e? No man is to receive the doctrine of <HI>Univer&s;al Salvation</HI> upon that account; any more than that <HI>mon&s;ter of mon&s;ters</HI> the doctrine of <HI>tran&s;ub&s;tantiation,</HI> becau&s;e embraced taught and defended by many Papi&s;ts far more pious, ingenious and excellent than ever was <HI>Jeremiah White.</HI></P>
<P>We are told (p. 4) that Mr. <HI>White</HI>'s introduction "breathes a &s;pirit of piety and benevolence," it is not pretended however that this is an argument in favour of a <HI>Univer&s;al Re&s;toration of the human race</HI>; and yet it may &s;erve to <HI>captivate &s;illy women,</HI> whether in petticoats or breeches, <HI>who are ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth</HI>; and to make them believe that he has the true knack of interpreting &s;cripture.</P>
<P>The only an&s;wer, that Mr. <HI>White</HI>'s <HI>benevolent</HI> rant and rhap&s;ody upon the divine goodne&s;s is entitled to, are the following lines of Dr. <HI>Young.</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="4" REF="017959_0007_0FA37E7D77A0FB68">
<L>"Not, <HI>thus,</HI> our infidels th' <HI>Eternal</HI> draw,</L>

<P>Having done with Mr. <HI>White</HI>'s introduction we &s;hould now proceed to his &s;cripture arguments, which we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e have not &s;uffered by being printed in the pre|&s;ent form; but it may be proper to lay down before|hand certain principles and rules, to be regarded, while we are interpreting the &s;criptures, and profe&s;s to vene|rate them as <HI>divine oracles.</HI></P>
<P>The writers being in&s;pired by one and the &s;ame Spirit, no real contradiction of doctrine can be admitted; and each mu&s;t be under&s;tood in a &s;en&s;e that accords with the whole.</P>
<P>The meaning of particular pa&s;&s;ages is not to be de|termined by the <HI>&s;ound</HI> of words; but the &s;ound of words is to be determined by the <HI>meaning</HI> of &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages, which mu&s;t be fixed by the connexion, cir|cum&s;tances, and agreement with other pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not u&s;e a violence in forcing particular &s;en&s;es upon &s;cripture expre&s;&s;ions, when we &s;hould <HI>blu&s;h</HI> to practi&s;e the &s;ame with human compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>The&s;e maxims being admitted, let us pa&s;s on to try Mr. <HI>White</HI>'s &s;cripture arguments.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t he produces is from the 1&s;t epi&s;tle to <HI>Timothy</HI> ii. 3, 4. <HI>God our Saviour, who will have all men to be &s;aved, and come to the knowledge of the truth.</HI> He tells
<PB N="5" REF="017959_0008_0FA37E7EB8358E90">
us that "the letter of this text is full and expre&s;s, <HI>God will have</HI> ALL MEN <HI>to be &s;aved,</HI> and &s;hould we pre&s;s it, there are almo&s;t as many arguments as words;" but we may <HI>pre&s;s</HI> it to death before we can extract one argument from it in favor of the <HI>Univer&s;al Re&s;toration of the human race.</HI> ALL MEN are in capitals, as though ALL nece&s;&s;arily meant <HI>every individual;</HI> and as though it would be ab&s;urd to under&s;tand the term with any limitation; whereas there are many univer|&s;als in &s;cripture u&s;e, that, if not under&s;tood with limi|tations, imply the greate&s;t fal&s;ehoods. It is truly ridiculous, to ob&s;erve how &s;ome trifling geniu&s;es will furni&s;h them&s;elves with a &s;et of <HI>univer&s;als,</HI> and, by jingling the &s;ame, plea&s;e them&s;elves and amu&s;e their admirers.</P>
<P>Unhappily for the chaplain, he &s;ays, "the words are to be taken in the <HI>&s;ame</HI> latitude and extent with other places," and quotes ch. vi. 13. <HI>God that quickneth all things.</HI> Working upon it by his own example, <HI>the letter is full and expre&s;s,</HI> God that quickneth ALL THINGS; and yet ALL in this pa&s;&s;age cannot be un|der&s;tood without a limitation; for &s;tocks and &s;tones and a number of other <HI>inanimate</HI> things God doth <HI>not</HI> quicken. We live in an age of wonders. Who knows, but what &s;ome wonderful interpreter, one of ten thou|&s;and, may ari&s;e &s;hortly, who &s;hall attempt proving from this pa&s;&s;age, together with the words of <HI>John</HI> the bapti&s;t&mdash;<HI>God is able of the&s;e &s;tones to rai&s;e up children to Abraham</HI>&mdash;that the period will come when <HI>univer&s;al animation &s;hall prevail,</HI> and the mountains &s;hall &s;kip with <HI>real life</HI> like rams, and the little hills like lambs.</P>
<P>Mr <HI>White</HI> or his tran&s;criber has mi&s;-quoted when he &s;ays "our Saviour tells us, <HI>all things live to God.</HI> Luke 20.38. for <HI>things</HI> is not expre&s;&s;ed, and cannot

be implied in the <HI>original,</HI> as the tran&s;ciber will know by con&s;ulting the Greek, which it is apprehended he under&s;tandeth.</P>
<P>The original word and its compound, u&s;ually tran&s;|lated <HI>all,</HI> occur, in the ma&s;culine, feminine and neuter genders, in the &s;ingular and plural numbers, not le&s;s than 1278 times.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. 131. Mark 72. Luke 174. John 63. Acts 184. Rom. 71. 1 Cor. 111. 2 Cor. 52. Gal. 16. Eph. 53. Phil. 34. Coll. 40. 1 The&s;&s;a. 18. 2 The&s;&s;a. 16. 1 Tim. 24. 2 Tim. 18. Titus 14. Philm. 2. Heb. 51.

<P>It is tran&s;lated variou&s;ly by the terms&mdash;<HI>whole&mdash;who|&s;oever&mdash;what&s;oever&mdash;whom&s;oever&mdash;all manner of&mdash;and all.</HI> When connected with a negative, it an&s;wers to <HI>any</HI>; but our tran&s;lators in&s;tead of <HI>not any</HI> render the terms <HI>no</HI>; thus <HI>no</HI> fle&s;h &s;hould be &s;aved (Mark 13.20) <HI>no</HI> fle&s;h &s;hall be ju&s;tified (Rom. 3.20)</P>
<P>It often intends <HI>every individual</HI> without exception, and at other times &s;ignifies only <HI>every kind,</HI> or <HI>a great</HI> number, and that even when the number is <HI>le&s;s</HI> than half of the kind. It is u&s;ed with like latitude that attends the term <HI>all,</HI> and when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> idiom will admit, is mo&s;tly tran&s;lated by it.</P>
<P>What follows will evince, that it is by no means nece&s;&s;ary to believe, that <HI>every &s;ingle man and wo|man will be &s;aved</HI>; becau&s;e we read, "God will have ALL men to be &s;aved!"</P>
<P>When we are told (Mat. 4.23) that our Lord healed <HI>every</HI> (as it is in the original and is &s;o rendered Mat. 9.35) &s;ickne&s;s, and every di&s;ea&s;e, we cannot under&s;tand any thing beyond what our tran&s;lators have intimated by &s;aying, <HI>all manner of</HI> &s;ickne&s;s and <HI>all manner</HI> of di&s;|ea&s;e. (The &s;ame may be ob&s;erved of Matt. 10.1.) It would be ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>all</HI> (or even <HI>half</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="017959_0010_0FA37E7FB92BA690">
of) the &s;ick and <HI>all</HI> the di&s;ea&s;ed of <HI>all Galilee</HI> &s;hould be brought to him. When it is mentioned (in the next, the 24th ver&s;e) that his fame went throughout <HI>all Syria,</HI> and they brought unto him <HI>all</HI> &s;ick people; nothing more could be de&s;igned than <HI>great numbers,</HI> and yet probably not a quarter of <HI>all</HI> the &s;ick through <HI>Syria,</HI> which was a large country. When our Lord told his apo&s;tles (Mat. 10.22) that they &s;hould be hated of <HI>all</HI> men, he nece&s;&s;arily excepted <HI>all</HI> that &s;hould entertain them and hear their words. When he pronounces the mu&s;tard &s;eed (Mat. 13.32) the lea&s;t of <HI>all</HI> &s;eeds, could he mean any other than that it was a &s;mall &s;eed, one of the lea&s;t? as every one knows there are much &s;maller &s;eeds. What a huge and &s;trong net mu&s;t that be (mentioned in the 47th v.) which when ca&s;t into the &s;ea, could gather of <HI>every</HI> kind; if by <HI>every</HI> (the &s;ame in the original with <HI>all</HI>) is intended every one what&s;oever without exception! Our Lord charged his di&s;ciples (Mat. 23.3.) to ob&s;erve <HI>all what&s;oever</HI> the Scribes and Phari&s;ees &s;itting in <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s &s;eat bade them ob&s;erve; but it was only <HI>that all what&s;oever,</HI> which agreed with <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the Prophets; for they taught many things from that &s;eat, which were derogatory from the glory of God and oppo&s;ite to his holy com|mands. "Had He enjoined an ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their dictates, He would in effect have forbid their be|lieving in him&s;elf, whom the &s;cribes rejected." Every American is aware, that the expre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be limited or that otherwi&s;e it is not true, that <HI>all</HI> they that take the &s;word &s;hall peri&s;h with or by the &s;word (Mat. 26.52)</P>
<P>When <HI>Simon</HI> &s;aid to our Lord (Mark 1.37) <HI>all</HI> men &s;eek for thee, did he include all the Sadducees, Scribes and Phari&s;ees? Our Lord and the di&s;ciples that attend|ed him were Jews, &s;ome of them eat with unwa&s;hed hands; and yet we read, that the Phari&s;ees and <HI>all</HI> the
<PB N="8" REF="017959_0011_0FA37E8078B58C30">
Jews except they wa&s;h their hands oft eat not (Mark 7.3.) When our Lord &s;aid, <HI>all</HI> things are po&s;&s;ible to him that believeth (Mark 9.23) were there not <HI>numberle&s;s</HI> exceptions &s;uppo&s;ed, though the words are <HI>full</HI> and <HI>expre&s;s</HI>? The like when he &s;aid (Mark 11.24) <HI>what things &s;o ever</HI> ye de&s;ire when ye pray, believe that ye receive them and ye &s;hall have them: and again (Mark 13.13.) ye &s;hall be hated of <HI>all</HI> men for my names &s;ake: and again (ver. 23.) behold I have foretold you <HI>all</HI> things. Did <HI>every individual</HI> of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> council con&s;ent, though it is a&s;&s;erted that they <HI>all</HI> condemned him, i. e. Chri&s;t, to be guilty of death (Mark 14.64) when we read (Luke 23, 51) that the coun&s;ellor <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> of <HI>Arimathea</HI> had not con&s;ented to the coun&s;el and deed of them?</P>
<P>We are informed (Luke 3.21) that <HI>all the people</HI> were baptized by <HI>John</HI>; but from <HI>John</HI>'s continuing to baptize long after this, it is evident, that <HI>all</HI> means only great numbers of <HI>all</HI> ranks and profe&s;&s;ions among the Jews. Our Lord tells the Phari&s;ees (Luke 16.16.) that <HI>every</HI> man pre&s;&s;ed into the kingdom of God; and yet <HI>they,</HI> &s;o far from doing it, hindered others all they could. When <HI>Luke</HI> &s;ays (19.7.) that they <HI>all</HI> murmured at &s;eeing our Lord going to be gue&s;t with <HI>Zaccheus,</HI> he could mean no more, than that there was a <HI>general</HI> murmur; for among the multitude there were many followers, who were &s;o attached to Chri&s;t as to be &s;atisfied with all he did. When the woman of <HI>Samaria</HI> cried out to the citizens "come &s;ee a man who told me <HI>all things that ever</HI> I did. Is not this the Chri&s;t?" (John 4.29.) none of them were &s;o fooli&s;h as to imagine, that &s;he included <HI>every</HI> tran&s;action of her life. When our Lord, to encou|rage his apo&s;tles, promi&s;es the Comforter, and adds (John 14.26) "He &s;hall teach you <HI>all</HI> things," He did
<PB N="9" REF="017959_0012_0FA37E8139C419E8">
not include <HI>all</HI> the arts and &s;ciences or other &s;uper|fluous knowledge; but all that was nece&s;&s;ary for them to know.</P>
<P>What words can be more <HI>full</HI> and <HI>expre&s;s</HI> than the following, "there were dwelling at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> Jews, devout men, out of <HI>every nation under heaven</HI> (Acts 2.5.) It is not only <HI>every nation,</HI> but every nation <HI>under heaven;</HI> and yet there were <HI>many</HI> nations at that time <HI>under heaven</HI> that were not known to any one in <HI>Jeru|&s;alem;</HI> though we &s;hould admit that <HI>America</HI> was not then peopled, whereas the contrary is mo&s;t probable. Every nation under heaven <HI>where</HI> the di&s;per&s;ed Jews dwelt, is evidently all that is intended. The di&s;ciples, we are informed, had <HI>all</HI> things common (Acts 2.44) but he that would infer from thence, that it was &s;o in <HI>every</HI> particular is not a fit member for either religious or civil &s;ociety, and would not be admitted to re&s;ide long even among <HI>Indians,</HI> was he to attempt reducing his principles to practice. <HI>Ananias</HI> &s;ays to <HI>Saul</HI> (Acts 22.15.) "thou &s;halt be his witne&s;s unto <HI>all</HI> men," though there were millions to whom <HI>Paul</HI> never preached, nor wrote, and to whom his very name was unknown.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> writes of him&s;elf (Rom. 7.8.)

no one was more conde&s;cending; and in <HI>all</HI> &s;uch things he was pliable as a thread; yet, when truth and holine&s;s were concerned, he was firm as the rock and bold as the lion.

<P>How unrea&s;onable, arbitrary and cruel would it be for a man to argue from his reading (Eph. 5.24.) "let the wives be &s;ubject to their own hu&s;bands in <HI>every thing,</HI>" that his wife was patiently to &s;ubmit to <HI>every</HI> cruelty and to <HI>every</HI> command, that he is plea&s;ed to lay her under, when intoxicated with wine, with rage, or attachments to other women. As unrea&s;onable as to argue, that there were no di&s;intere&s;ted chri&s;tians but <HI>Timothy,</HI> when the apo&s;tle wrote (Phil. 2.21.) "for <HI>all</HI> &s;eek their own things, not the things of Je&s;us Chri&s;t."</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t epi&s;tle to <HI>Timothy</HI> (6.10.) t' apo&s;tle tells us, "the love of money is the root of <HI>all</HI> evil;" and yet we know, that there is <HI>much</HI> evil that hath nothing to do with the love of money, and doth not grow upon that root. He &s;ays in his letter to Titus (2.11.) that "the grace of God," viz. in the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, "<HI>hath appeared</HI> to <HI>all</HI> men," which mu&s;t be under&s;tood as intending <HI>men of all</HI> nations ranks and orders; for every individual man, even myriads, <HI>had not</HI> been made acquainted with the go&s;pel.</P>
<P><HI>John</HI> tells us in the Revelation (5.13.) "and <HI>every</HI> creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and &s;uch as are in the &s;ea, and <HI>all things</HI> that are in them, heard I &s;aying, Ble&s;&s;ing and honour and glory and power be unto him that &s;itteth upon the throne and to the Lamb forever and ever." Will a per&s;on of any &s;en&s;e &s;uppo&s;e from hence, that every thing that was before mute became vocal; and not rather, that <HI>all</HI> nature in different ways concurr'd in this &s;ong of prai&s;e.</P>

When Babylon becomes the hold of <HI>every</HI> foul &s;pirit and a cage of <HI>every</HI> unclean and hateful bird (Rev. 18.2.) we cannot &s;uppo&s;e that foul &s;pirits, unclean and hateful birds are to be found in no other part of the univer&s;e than <HI>Babylon</HI>: nor can we under&s;tand the phra&s;e lite|rally when it &s;aid (ver&s;e 24.) in her was found the blood of <HI>all</HI> that were &s;lain upon the earth.

<P>But as &s;aith Dr. <HI>Doddridge</HI> "it would be endle&s;s to enumerate the texts, where common &s;en&s;e requires us to take the word <HI>all</HI> in this general manner."</P>
<P>We may fairly conclude, from this induction of par|ticulars, that we are not bound to admit, that <HI>no one what&s;oever,</HI> let him be the mo&s;t abandoned profligate that ever exi&s;ted, will mi&s;s of <HI>final</HI> &s;alvation, becau&s;e the apo&s;tle has u&s;ed the term ALL, and &s;aid "God will have ALL men to be &s;aved."</P>

Thus <HI>powerfully,</HI> and <HI>irre|&s;i&s;tibly</HI> does God <HI>will all men to be &s;aved.</HI>" Boldly a&s;&s;erted! When a man is haranguing and has a point to carry, there is nothing like declaring roundly and with the utmo&s;t confidence, without di&s;covering the lea&s;t change of countenance or trepidation of voice, <HI>the &s;tory is true, it is certainly &s;o,</HI> let it be ever &s;o contrary to rea&s;on, &s;cripture or facts; for he will find &s;ome, who will credit him upon it, even <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> who are &s;en&s;ible and judicious in other re&s;pects; but, through weakne&s;s of intellectual nerves, they &s;uffer them&s;elves to be <HI>&s;tormed</HI> out of their &s;en&s;es, by the daring a&s;&s;aults of de&s;peradoes in religion.</P>
<P>However, not to be terrified by Mr. <HI>White</HI>'s bold a&s;&s;ertions, let us try the truth of them; and their agreement with his next paragraph, wherein we read "as he, i. e. God, <HI>wills</HI> the end, &s;o does he <HI>will</HI> the <HI>nece&s;&s;ary means leading</HI> to it.

is indi&s;putable that not one half of the world is chri&s;tianized; and that, &s;o continuing, it is morally impo&s;&s;ible, they &s;hould have the <HI>knowledge of the truth.</HI> But if the end is not to be obtained without the ne|ce&s;&s;ary means, and the nece&s;&s;ary means, do not take place&mdash;if no man <HI>is</HI> or <HI>can be</HI> &s;anctified or &s;aved with|out the <HI>knowledge</HI> of the truth; and yet millions live and die, from age age, without this knowledge, then it mu&s;t follow, that the <HI>will</HI> of that Being, who is &s;aid to will that ALL MEN come to the knowledge of the truth, cannot mean that <HI>authoritative will,</HI> which is accompanied with <HI>uncontroulable</HI> power and is <HI>ever obeyed.</HI> Seeing then that God doth as power|fully and irre&s;i&s;tably will all men <HI>to come to the know|ledge of the truth,</HI> as <HI>to be &s;aved;</HI> and that facts with|out number evidence, that all men come <HI>not</HI> to the knowledge of the truth, we are reduced, by dire nece&s;&s;ity, to under&s;tand the divine will in the text for the <HI>approving</HI> and not the determining and effecting will of God.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle makes no difference between God's willing that all &s;hould be &s;aved, and his willing that all &s;hould come to the knowledge of the truth.

<P>Our Saviour, to &s;ilence the cavils of the phari&s;ees at his eating with publicans and &s;inners, tells them to go and learn what that meaneth I <HI>will have mercy and not &s;acrifice.</HI> (Matt 9.13.) And when they complained to him, that his di&s;ciples did what was not lawful to do upon the &s;abbath, he an&s;wers them by &s;aying, "if ye had known what this meaneth, <HI>I will have mercy and not &s;acrifice,</HI> ye would not have condemned the guiltle&s;s (Matt. 12, 7.) The words are a quotation from <HI>Ho&s;ea</HI> (6.6) There <HI>Jehovah</HI> &s;aith by the prophet, "for I <HI>de&s;ir'd</HI> mercy and not &s;acrifice; and the know|ledge of God more than burnt-offerings." Dr. <HI>Doddridge</HI> renders the <HI>Greek</HI> in <HI>Matthew,</HI> "I <HI>require</HI> mercy and not &s;acrifice;" and then notes, "&s;o the <HI>Greek</HI> evidently &s;ignifies, when it expre&s;&s;es the will of a &s;uperior; and this the original <HI>Hebrew</HI> word im|ports, which &s;eems to an&s;wer to that modern phra&s;e u&s;ed by princes <HI>&s;uch is our plea&s;ure.</HI>" The Septuagint tran&s;lation varies &s;omewhat from our Saviour's quotation, which is as the <HI>Hebrew</HI> "mercy and not &s;acrifice," whereas the other is mercy <HI>rather than</HI> or <HI>before</HI> &s;acri|fice, and the knowledge of God <HI>rather than</HI> or <HI>before</HI> burnt-offerings." The Septuagint ob&s;erving, that the &s;ub&s;equent clau&s;e in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> determined the &s;en&s;e of the preceding, rendered both in the &s;ame manner.

<P>One of the greate&s;t <HI>Hebricians</HI> that this century hath produced, <HI>Schultens,</HI> makes <HI>to bend</HI> the primary notion of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> root in <HI>Ho&s;ea;</HI> from whence the tran&s;ition is ea&s;y to the &s;ub&s;equent &s;econdary &s;igni|fications&mdash;"to have a ready, well-di&s;po&s;ed, and cheer|ful inclination of will and affection; to be well affected to; to favour; to delight in; to be willing; to choo&s;e;" which are given as the common meaning of the word by Dr. <HI>Taylor</HI> in his <HI>Hebrew</HI> Concordance. He hath omitted mentioning <HI>to will,</HI> but cannot be thought to mean, that it &s;hould be excluded; &s;eeing, that the <HI>very fir&s;t tran&s;lation</HI> he gives, is in the <HI>Latin</HI> for <HI>to will;</HI> and in this he agrees with <HI>Pagninus, Buxtorf, Leigh, Opitius, Stock,</HI> and others, who had before interpreted the <HI>Hebrew</HI> root in the like manner that he hath done.</P>
<P>The Doctor in his preface remarks to the following purport, "The words and phra&s;es of the new te&s;tament are but the words and phra&s;es of the old tran&s;lated into <HI>Greek.</HI> The &s;ame language runs through the whole, and is &s;et in &s;uch a variety of lights, that one part is well adapted to illu&s;trate another. To under|&s;tand the meaning of the Spirit in the new, it is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary that we under&s;tand its &s;en&s;e in the old te&s;tament. By carefully collating tho&s;e places of the &s;acred code where any word is u&s;ed, you may judge what &s;en&s;e it will, or will not bear.

<HI>good will</HI>; his <HI>approving,</HI> and not his <HI>determining, effecting, omnipotent</HI> will. The divine Being exerci&s;eth a <HI>moral</HI> government over his rational creatures. They have all a law written upon their hearts; to &s;ome he hath given a fuller and clearer revelation of his mind. By that He tells us, what we are to do, and what we are to forbear. When we go contrary to his direc|tions we act wickedly; when we obey them we act righteou&s;ly. It is his <HI>will</HI> and <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> that we &s;hould act righteou&s;ly.

His &s;acred oracles are written in the language and dialect of the&s;e lower re|gions; and not, to us, in the <HI>unintelligible</HI> dialect of the upper; being de&s;igned for <HI>mortals,</HI> and not for angels. They &s;peak after the <HI>manner of men,</HI> who cannot &s;peak or conceive of the divine Being above human abilities; and therefore, to excite &s;uitable thoughts and affections in them, di&s;tinctions are u&s;ed concerning the Deity, and pa&s;&s;ions a&s;cribed to him, which do not really belong to his nature, and which, to prevent mi&s;takes, we are taught in other places are foreign to it, as implying changeablene&s;s and imperfection.

It is the <HI>will</HI> and <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> of every kind &s;ove|reign on earth, that all his people may be good &s;ubjects, and reap the benefit of it: and it is the <HI>will</HI> and <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> of the King of kings, that all his rea&s;onable creatures &s;hould be faithful and obedient &s;ubjects, and of con&s;equence enjoy &s;alvation.</P>

This pa&s;&s;age has been greatly perplexed and tortured by de&s;igning and intere&s;ted theori&s;ts, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to &s;upport a favourite &s;cheme. Dr. <HI>Doddridge</HI>'s tran&s;lation is certainly a ju&s;t one&mdash;"Quickened by the Spirit, by which (or whom) <HI>going forth</HI> he preached to the &s;pirits in pri&s;on, who were <HI>long &s;ince</HI> di&s;obedient."&mdash; The Spirit by whom our Lord was quickened was the Spirit of God; this

Spirit was granted to <HI>Noah,</HI> that preacher of righteou&s;|ne&s;s, by our Lord, who is therefore &s;poken of as <HI>going forth</HI> by him and <HI>preaching</HI> to tho&s;e &s;pirits in pri&s;on, who were long &s;ince, or formerly di&s;obedient, when once the long &s;uffering of God waited in the days of <HI>Noah.</HI></P>
<P>Whether this interpretation be allowed or rejected, matters not to the ca&s;e in hand. Let per&s;ons main|tain, if they will, that the pa&s;&s;age refers to our Lords de&s;cent into hell or limbus patrum, and to his preach|ing there; it doth not appear from it, that his preach|ing proved effectual for the &s;alvation of <HI>any</HI>; for <HI>Peter,</HI> at writing, &s;peaks of the auditors as being &s;till <HI>&s;pirits in pri&s;on,</HI> and makes no mention of any's returning with our Lord to a better place. His &s;aying, who were <HI>long &s;ince</HI> or <HI>formerly</HI> di&s;obedient, doth not argue that they were not <HI>now</HI> di&s;obedient; for if they were not <HI>now</HI> di&s;obedient, they would &s;carce be &s;hut up in pri&s;on: but he alludes to that particular di&s;obedience in the day of their trial, when once the long &s;uffering of God waited to &s;ee, what would be the effect of <HI>Noah</HI>'s preaching; and which di&s;obedience proved the occa&s;ion of their being ca&s;t into pri&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Paul</HI> was a mo&s;t zealous indefatigable preacher; and it is not to be doubted, but that he would readily have po&s;tponed going to heaven, on quitting the body, and have vi&s;ited the damned in hell, had there been the lea&s;t glimmering hope that he &s;hould be in&s;trumental in &s;av|ing a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> &s;oul out of that place of torments; whereas whenever he mentions being ab&s;ent from the body, he concludes that he &s;hall be pre&s;ent with the Lord. It is now above four thou&s;and years &s;ince the di&s;obedient in the days of <HI>Noah</HI> were &s;ent to the pri&s;on of hell; and we have not yet had <HI>certain authentic</HI> intelligence of <HI>any one's</HI> having been brought, by means of his torments, to godly repentance, and commenced an holy per&s;on, and in con&s;equence of &s;uch change obtained a removal to glory.</P>

<P>Now let us try, whether the other texts, quoted in the pamphlet, will admit of an interpretation agreeing with what hath been already advanced: they mu&s;t, or there is a manife&s;t oppo&s;ition between different parts of &s;cripture&mdash;the more ea&s;y and natural &s;uch inter|pretation, the more &s;atisfactory it will prove.

When in the 4th ch. 10 v. he &s;tiles God the <HI>Saviour of all men</HI>; it is not in allu&s;ion to <HI>&s;piritual,</HI> but <HI>temporal</HI> deliverance. We read (Judges 3.9) "the Lord rai&s;ed up a <HI>deliverer</HI> to the children of I&s;rael;" and again (15 v.) "the Lord rai&s;ed them up a <HI>deliverer</HI>;" in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> it is a <HI>Saviour,</HI> as noted in the margin of &s;ome bibles: the Septuagint u&s;e the &s;ame word as in <HI>Timothy. Samuel</HI> tells the Jews (1 Sam. 10.19) "ye have this day rejected your God, who him&s;elf <HI>&s;aved</HI> you out of all your adver&s;ities and your tribulations." The Septua|gint tran&s;late it, "who him&s;elf is the <HI>Saviour</HI> of you, out of all your evils and your tribulations," employing the

The title an&s;wers to that in Job 7.20. <HI>Pre&s;erver of men.

<P>We are told, "that all men, <HI>reprobate</HI> as well as <HI>elect,</HI> have <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>&s;elf &s;ame God.</HI> The <HI>elect</HI> have not <HI>one</HI> God, and <HI>reprobate another</HI>; but <HI>one God</HI> in the God of them <HI>both.</HI> To adopt the words in <HI>Mala|chy</HI> 2.10.

"It is a people of no under&s;tanding, there|fore he that <HI>made</HI> them will &s;hew them <HI>no favour.</HI>" If a people may be thus dealt with, when univer&s;ally abandoned, though there may be certain good characters among them&mdash;a <HI>Noah,</HI> a <HI>Daniel,</HI> a <HI>Job</HI>&mdash;much more may the wor&s;t individuals.</P>

to all of that character, without any regard to their circum&s;tances, nation or place of abode; his benevo|lent heart glows with the thought, and in an exta&s;y of plea&s;ure he adds, "and <HI>not</HI> for <HI>ours only,</HI> but for the &s;ins of the WHOLE WORLD," meaning believers whether <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Gentiles,</HI> every where over the whole world.

<P>The <HI>ingenious</HI> Mr. <HI>White</HI> pur&s;uing his &s;ubject, refers us to <HI>Romans</HI> 5. from the 15th to the 19th v. <HI>But not as the offence, &s;o al&s;o is the free gift: for if through the offence of one, many be dead; much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man Je&s;us Chri&s;t, hath abounded unto many. And not as it was by one that &s;inned, &s;o is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto ju&s;tification. For if by one man's offence death reigned by one, much more they which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hall reign in life by one, Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Therefore, as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condem|nation, even &s;o by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of one, the free gift came upon all men, unto ju&s;tification of life.

of God, called</HI> and <HI>holy. Paul</HI> &s;ets him&s;elf, in the latter part of the chapter, to "&s;hew that the calamities brought by the <HI>fir&s;t Adam</HI> on <HI>his</HI> &s;eed, are repaired with glorious advantage to all who by faith become intere&s;ted in the <HI>&s;econd Adam</HI>;" as is ob&s;erved by Dr. <HI>Doddridge</HI>; who in his note upon the 12th v. &s;ays "as this ver&s;e is an inference from the 11th, it &s;eems evident that believers only are &s;poken of; for it is plain from comparing the 9th, 10th, and 11th ver&s;es with the 1&s;t, that it is only they, <HI>who are ju&s;tified by faith, who have peace with God, and who joy in him by Chri&s;t as having received the reconciliation.</HI> And this obvious remark clears the following pa&s;&s;age of difficul|ties, which would be exceeding great, if it were to be con&s;idered without regard to this connection, and which have in fact, mi&s;led many <HI>commentators</HI>; who for want of attending to it, have plunged them&s;elves and their readers into great perplexity, and given a &s;en&s;e to the paragraph, of which it is by no means capable." He afterwards remarks, that the 12th, 18th and 19th ver&s;es make one continued &s;entence, and that the in|termediate ver&s;es do undoubtedly come in as a parenthe&s;is.</P>
<P>In the 14th v. <HI>Adam</HI> is &s;tiled the figure, or model of him who was to come, viz, the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> or <HI>&s;econd Adam.</HI> Each is de&s;cribed as a publick per&s;on or fe|deral head, to his re&s;pective &s;eed or po&s;terity&mdash;herein they agreed; but <HI>not</HI> in this (whatever Mr. <HI>White</HI> a&s;&s;erts) "that they each, by turns, <HI>repre&s;ented mankind.</HI>" Neither do the words <HI>many</HI> and <HI>all,</HI> wherever they occur in this pa&s;&s;age, take in the <HI>whole</HI> human race: when connected with the <HI>fir&s;t Adam</HI> they take in <HI>all his &s;eed</HI>; and when connected with the <HI>&s;econd Adam</HI> they take in <HI>all his,</HI> but none other. Mr. <HI>White</HI> un|warily for him&s;elf admits the di&s;tinction between the
<PB N="41" REF="017959_0044_0FA37E9939F6CE60">
&s;eed of the fir&s;t and of the &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> while he &s;peaks of "the one &s;in of Adam's being charged upon <HI>all his</HI> &s;eed, and the abundance of <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> righteou&s;|ne&s;s being imputed to <HI>his</HI> &s;eed." The &s;eed of <HI>Adam</HI> includes <HI>all</HI> mankind de&s;cending from him in the ordinary way; and the &s;eed of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> intends the <HI>believing part</HI> of mankind, as is evident from this chapter and other parts of &s;cripture. Herein <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> agree, that they are publick per&s;ons; and that they convey important con&s;equences to their par|ticular po&s;terity; but they differ in &s;everal re&s;pects. <HI>Adam</HI> conveyed to <HI>his</HI> po&s;terity, <HI>&s;in</HI> and <HI>death</HI>; Chri&s;t conveyeth to <HI>his, righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>life.</HI> Nor is the <HI>offence</HI> and the <HI>free gift</HI> exactly alike. "<HI>Through the offence of one,</HI> Adam, the <HI>multitude</HI> of his po&s;terity <HI>died;</HI> but <HI>the grace of God and the gift by grace which is by one man, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, hath much more abounded to the multitude</HI> of his po&s;terity, and that in two very impor|tant articles. In the fir&s;t place, <HI>the gift</HI> is <HI>not</HI> merely <HI>as</HI> the ruin that came upon us <HI>by one that &s;inned</HI> in re&s;pect of the number of offences in que&s;tion; <HI>for the &s;entence of one</HI> offence pa&s;&s;ed upon us <HI>to condemnation; but the free gift</HI> is effectual <HI>to</HI> our <HI>ju&s;tification from many offences. Moreover,</HI> in the next place, <HI>if by one man's offence death reigned by one</HI> over all his po&s;terity; then <HI>they who</HI> thankfully and obediently <HI>receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hall much more reign in life by</HI> the <HI>one</HI> re&s;torer and re|coverer of his &s;eed, <HI>even Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>; they &s;hall by him be brought to a much nobler and more ex|cellent life than that from which Adam fell and which they lo&s;t in him." The agreement between <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in conveying important con&s;equences (though the con&s;equences are extremely different) each to his particular po&s;terity is &s;ummarily &s;tate in the 18th

and 19th ver&s;es, when the apo&s;tle re&s;umes the &s;ubject he had began in the 12th v, having fini&s;hed his paren|the&s;is.

<P>The above paraphra&s;e is chiefly an abridgment of Dr. Doddridge's, with a few &s;mall alterations.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age we have been con&s;idering appears to be written much after the modern curt &s;entimental manner&mdash;in broken, incomplete &s;entences&mdash;to be per|fected by the contemplative mind of the knowing and judicious reader. But not to evade the force of it as quoted in &s;upport of Univer&s;al Salvation. It is pleaded&mdash;"there is one offence upon <HI>all men</HI> to condemnation, and the righteou&s;ne&s;s of one upon <HI>all men</HI> to ju&s;tification;" and it may be urged "there is an oppo&s;ition between that condemnation which comes upon <HI>all men</HI> through the offence of one, and that ju&s;tification of life which comes upon <HI>all men</HI> by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of one, i. e. of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>; and therefore <HI>all men</HI> mu&s;t be taken in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e in both parts of the ver&s;e, and con&s;equently mu&s;t be extended to <HI>all man|kind.</HI>" This &s;tates the argument rather &s;tronger than is done by Mr. <HI>White.</HI> "But it is not rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that the terms of oppo&s;ition have any re&s;pect to the <HI>univer&s;al extent</HI> of condemnation and ju&s;tification, for the apo&s;tle's de&s;ign is not to compare the <HI>number</HI> of tho&s;e who &s;hall be ju&s;tified, with that of tho&s;e who are condemned by the fall of <HI>Adam</HI>; but to compare the two heads together, <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>; and to &s;hew, that as we are liable to condemnation by the one, &s;o
<PB N="43" REF="017959_0046_0FA37E9B39D3F868">
we obtain righteou&s;ne&s;s by the other." From what was before noted it appears, that the terms <HI>all</HI> and <HI>many,</HI> when de&s;igned to expre&s;s the numbers benefited by <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as a federal head, comprehend <HI>his &s;eed only,</HI> and not all mankind; which may be farther argued from the <HI>nature</HI> of the <HI>privileges</HI> with which &s;uch are benefited. They are of the highe&s;t importance, nothing le&s;s than <HI>ju&s;tification,</HI> or a judicial acquittal from the guilt of many offences, together with <HI>eternal life</HI>: and "it is &s;o plain, that they are appropriated to per|&s;ons of a particular character, expre&s;&s;ed (in the 17th v.) by <HI>receiving the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> that it is &s;urpri&s;ing any &s;hould have &s;poken of them as <HI>common</HI> to the whole human race. And nothing is more evident, than that the original word for <HI>receive</HI> often &s;ignifies <HI>being active in em|bracing</HI> a benefit propo&s;ed, or a per&s;on offering him&s;elf under a character of importance."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Doddridge's note.</NOTE></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>White</HI> admits, that none but tho&s;e, who <HI>now lay hold</HI> on the gift of righteou&s;ne&s;s, have the <HI>imme|diate benefit</HI> of it; but &s;alves the difficulty, by &s;uppo&s;ing that others will reap the benefit of it <HI>hereafter,</HI> and by pleading that the word <HI>all</HI> mu&s;t be taken as univer&s;ally when <HI>ju&s;tification</HI> through the righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is &s;poken of, as when <HI>condemnation</HI> through the offence of <HI>Adam.</HI></P>
<P>This plea hath been already an&s;wered; but he at|tempts to &s;trengthen it by &s;aying, for <HI>all died in Adam</HI> and therefore <HI>all &s;hall be made alive in Chri&s;t.</HI> The&s;e words he quoted before, and inferred from them the re&s;urrection of <HI>believers</HI> and <HI>unbelievers</HI>: herein he was not &s;ingular: others have done the &s;ame, but without attending &s;ufficiently to the chapter from whence they are taken; in which the apo&s;tle treats <HI>not,</HI> of the re&s;urrection of the ungodly; but <HI>only</HI> of
<PB N="44" REF="017959_0047_0FA37E9BB2A25B48">
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s and that of <HI>believers,</HI> as con&s;equent upon <HI>his.</HI> When he writes (1 Cor. 15.16 &mdash; 20) "if <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> be not rai&s;ed, <HI>your faith</HI> is vain: then they which are fallen <HI>a&s;leep in Chri&s;t</HI> are peri&s;hed. If in this life only <HI>we</HI> have hope in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> we are of all men mo&s;t mi&s;erable. But now is <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> ri&s;en from the dead, and become the <HI>fir&s;t fruits</HI> of them that &s;lept;" it is evident that he hath his eye to believers, with re&s;pect to <HI>whom only Chri&s;t</HI> is the <HI>fir&s;t fruits</HI>; he is not the <HI>fir&s;t fruits</HI> of them who come forth from their graves to the re&s;urrection of damnation. When <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith therefore, "&s;ince by man came death, by man came al&s;o the re&s;urrection of the dead; for as in <HI>Adam all</HI> die, even &s;o in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hall <HI>all</HI> be made alive" (v. 21, 22.) we mu&s;t under&s;tand the re&s;urrection of the dead as referring <HI>only</HI> to the re&s;urrection of <HI>pious be|lievers,</HI> and the <HI>all that are made alive</HI> as intending them: in which we are confirmed by the following ver&s;es of the chapter: for "every man <HI>is rai&s;ed</HI> in his <HI>own</HI> order, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> the fir&s;t fruits, and afterward <HI>they that are Chri&s;t</HI>'s, at his coming:" by <HI>they that are Chri&s;t</HI>'s is meant they that had fallen a&s;leep in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> or decea&s;ed chri&s;tians. The apo&s;tle doth not proceed to mention a word about the re&s;urrection of the un|godly: but when he comes to an&s;wer objections again&s;t the doctrine of the re&s;urrection a&s;&s;erts that the dead body is rai&s;ed in <HI>glory</HI>&mdash;in <HI>power&mdash;a &s;piritual body, in the image of Chri&s;t's heavenly body,</HI> &s;o that <HI>death is</HI> triumphantly <HI>&s;wallowed up in victory</HI>: which a&s;&s;ertions can never be applied to them, who come forth from their graves to the re&s;urrection of damnation, and awake to &s;hame and everla&s;ting contempt.</P>
<P>The la&s;t quotation pre&s;ented us from Mr. <HI>White,</HI> is, his remarks upon Eph. 1.9, 10; and Col. 1.20. The apo&s;tle writes to the <HI>Ephe&s;ians,</HI> "having made
<PB N="45" REF="017959_0048_0FA37E9C3AB2D718">
known unto us <HI>the my&s;tery</HI> of his will, according to his good plea&s;ure which he hath purpo&s;ed in him|&s;elf," v. 9. The my&s;tery &s;poken of is <HI>not,</HI> that the wicked part of the creation, whether men or devils, &s;hould, with the holy part of it, be reheaded in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>; but that the benefits of the go&s;pel were com|mon to the <HI>Gentiles</HI> with the <HI>Jews.</HI> "The calling of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> had been long a &s;ecret, of which nei|ther they nor the <HI>Jews</HI> had any conception, till re|vealed by the holy Spirit to the <HI>Apo&s;tles.</HI>" That this is meant by <HI>the my&s;tery</HI> here, is evident from the begin|ning of the 3d chapter to the 10th v. and it is called <HI>the my&s;tery of Chri&s;t</HI> (in the 4th v. of the 3d chapter and in Col. 4.3.) This was <HI>the my&s;tery</HI> for which the apo&s;tle was in bonds (Eph. 6.19. Col. 4.3.) We may &s;ay with Dr. Taylor (in his note upon Rom. 5.18.) "the grand point in view is the exten&s;ive|ne&s;s of the grace of the go&s;pel, in oppo&s;ition to the narrow principles of the <HI>Jews,</HI> who would have con|fined &s;alvation within the pale of their peculiarity." Had not Mr. <HI>White</HI>'s prejudice diverted him from at|tending to this important point, he would have found the key by which to have opened the next words: but he fir&s;t fixes an un&s;criptural &s;en&s;e upon the 10th ver&s;e, and then tells us <HI>that</HI> is <HI>the my&s;tery</HI> &s;poken of in the 9th. The calling of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> to a full partici|pation of &s;imilar privileges with the <HI>Jews</HI> was <HI>that my&s;tery,</HI> which was &s;o ordered, "that in the di&s;pen&s;a|tion of the fulne&s;s of times, he (i. e. God) might re|unite under one head all things in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> both which are in heaven and which are on earth." Dr. <HI>Doddridge</HI> hath the following note on the la&s;t clau&s;e, containing the true &s;en&s;e of the ver&s;e. "<HI>Both in heaven and earth</HI> is con&s;idered by &s;ome, as a <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> phra&s;e to expre&s;s the <HI>whole world</HI>; and Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> thinks it may be equiva|lent

<P>The church at <HI>Colo&s;&s;e</HI> con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of <HI>Gentile</HI> converts, as did that at <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI>; and <HI>Paul</HI>'s epi&s;tle to it was written as that to the <HI>Ephe&s;ians,</HI> when he was in bonds. He takes &s;pecial notice in both of that <HI>my&s;tery of Chri&s;t,</HI> of which we have been &s;peaking; and in Col. 1.20. expre&s;&s;eth the &s;ame &s;entiment we have con&s;idered, with a &s;mall variation in words, "and (having made peace through the blood of his cro&s;s) by him to reconcile all things to him&s;elf, by him, I &s;ay, whether they be things on earth or things in heaven."

<P>&mdash;"Thus much for the excellent <HI>Jeremiah White,</HI>" at pre&s;ent: proceed we to another writer upon the &s;ame &s;ubject of <HI>Salvation for all men</HI>; who, though not honoured as Mr. <HI>White</HI> with the epithet <HI>excellent,</HI> is certainly as <HI>extraordinary</HI> an interpreter of the &s;acred oracles.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle being led to &s;peak of the re&s;urrection of believers at the coming of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> (1 Cor. 15.23) without damping his pre&s;ent joyful feelings, ari&s;ing from the contemplation of a glorious re&s;urrection, by &s;taying to take notice of the awful &s;olemnities of the la&s;t judgment, &s;prings forward in his views to the con|&s;ummation of the mediatorial &s;cheme, and crys out, "then, or after that, the end! when he &s;hall deliver up the kingdom to God even the Father; when he &s;hall have put down all rule, and all authority, and power: for he mu&s;t reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The la&s;t enemy <HI>that</HI> &s;hall be de&s;troyed, <HI>is</HI> death. For he hath put all things under his feet.

And when all things &s;hall be &s;ubdued unto him, then &s;hall the Son al&s;o him&s;elf be &s;ubject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all."

It may &s;o, in the opinion of one, who appears to be wi&s;e above what is written, and to leave the common explanation, that he may force upon us an <HI>uncommon</HI> one, in order to &s;erve a purpo&s;e. To &s;erve this purpo&s;e he unfairly introduces into the pa&s;&s;age a di&s;tinction that hath nothing to do with it, <HI>the di&s;tinction</HI> between the fir&s;t and &s;econd death; and then very artfully endeavours to palm upon his reader, the <HI>poore&s;t</HI> and <HI>lowe&s;t</HI> of all ideas, even a <HI>fal&s;e one,</HI> that the apo&s;tle &s;pake of the &s;econd death as well as of the fir&s;t, when he &s;aid, "the la&s;t enemy that &s;hall be de&s;troyed is <HI>death</HI>:" whereas it is plain from the whole chapter, that he &s;peaks of that <HI>fir&s;t corporeal death</HI> which is de&s;troyed by the re&s;urrection. This death is the la&s;t enemy "that continues to hold in &s;ome &s;ort the &s;ubjects of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> under its dominion;" and is the <HI>la&s;t</HI> to be totally and literally de&s;troyed; and its de&s;truction commenceth upon the &s;ounding of that trumpet which announceth the coming of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to judgment. Now if this death is the <HI>la&s;t</HI> enemy to be totally and literally de&s;troyed, what becomes of our author's &s;cheme? For after its de&s;truction followeth that awful judgment which will con&s;ign the devil and his angels and the un|godly race of mankind to the pains of the &s;econd death; and thus the ab&s;olute de&s;truction of <HI>&s;in, Satan</HI>

<P>The <HI>common explanation</HI> may be pronounced <HI>poor</HI> and <HI>low</HI>; but if the <HI>true</HI> one, and according to the divine mind, it would argue more wi&s;dom and piety to withhold the epithets.

<P>He is certainly an uncommon genius, or he would never have thought of finding in the <HI>fir&s;t promi&s;e</HI> of a Saviour, the doctrine of <HI>Salvation for all men.</HI> He tells us that the words (in Gen. 3.15.) <HI>And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy &s;eed and her &s;eed; he &s;hall brui&s;e thy head, and thou &s;halt brui&s;e his heel</HI>; are de&s;igned to convey the thought of

What means our author by &s;aying the <HI>devil,</HI> that is, his <HI>kingdom?</HI> Is the <HI>devil</HI> and his <HI>kingdom</HI> one and the &s;ame, &s;o that

the de&s;truction of the latter is the de&s;truction of the former? Then indeed, he who de&s;troys the <HI>building,</HI> de&s;troys the <HI>builder.</HI></P>
<P>But our author &s;eems to think, that if the human race are <HI>all &s;aved,</HI> then the devil's kingdom will be de&s;troyed. He hath herein overlookt certain truths of no &s;mall importance in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. Sin did not <HI>fir&s;t</HI> begin, when <HI>Adam</HI> fell in paradi&s;e; but in the bli&s;sful regions, when the angels deviated from their <HI>fir&s;t &s;tate</HI> of integrity and holine&s;s, and for their thus &s;in|ning were ca&s;t down to hell. One of the&s;e fallen angels, for &s;ome &s;pecial rea&s;on, is &s;tiled the <HI>devil</HI> and di&s;tingui&s;hed from <HI>his</HI> angels; and probably is the &s;ame active and leading agent in wickedne&s;s that is meant by <HI>Beelzebub</HI> the prince of devils. While the <HI>devil</HI> and <HI>his</HI> angels remain at enmity with God, retaining their character as <HI>rebels</HI> again&s;t him, <HI>&s;in</HI> and <HI>lu&s;t</HI> &s;till reign. If then, the <HI>being</HI> of the devil is to be &s;pared; and yet, <HI>&s;in,</HI> that work of the devil, mu&s;t, according to the fir&s;t promi&s;e, be <HI>totally</HI> and <HI>ab&s;olutely,</HI> de&s;troyed, by him who was born of a woman; the words in Gene&s;is are a promi&s;e of &s;alvation to the <HI>devil</HI> and <HI>his</HI> angels, no le&s;s than to <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>his</HI> po&s;terity. But that this promi&s;e of &s;alvation to them, &s;hould come in while the Deity was pronouncing a cur&s;e upon the &s;erpent, <HI>appears to me impo&s;&s;ible!</HI></P>
<P>Another text from the &s;ame writer, and the la&s;t which the extractor brings to view, is recorded in Revelation 5.13. <HI>And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and &s;uch as are in the &s;ea, and all that are in them, heard I &s;aying, ble&s;&s;ing and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that &s;itteth upon the throne, and unto the lamb for ever and ever.</HI> The interpre|tation given to this pa&s;&s;age, is farther from the truth,

It hath no manner of relation to tran&s;actions <HI>beyond</HI> the day of judgment; it is a figurative repre&s;entation pre|&s;ented to <HI>John</HI> in vi&s;ion, before the Lamb opened any one of the &s;eals, of that book wherein was written the future condition of the church at different periods. The general opinion is, that <HI>John</HI> was bani&s;hed to the i&s;le of <HI>Patmos</HI> in the reign of <HI>Domitian</HI> about the year 96; &s;ome place it earlier, none later. The period connected with the opening of the fir&s;t &s;eal is thought by Dr. <HI>Newton,</HI> bi&s;hop of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> to have terminated with the life of the emperor <HI>Nerva,</HI> A. D. 98. He &s;uppo&s;eth, that the bani&s;hment of <HI>John</HI> hap|ned under <HI>Nero</HI>'s per&s;ecution; and that the period commenced with <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> in 70, when <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> was de&s;troyed.

of that magnitude, and who&s;e &s;ubject matter, in places, is &s;o peculiar as to require it.

el&s;e, &s;hould you deduct from tho&s;e antediluvians who were <HI>born</HI> into the world, only fifty years for their <HI>minority,</HI> It is evidently contra&s;ted to <HI>death</HI> or <HI>mor|tality,</HI> and threfore nece&s;&s;arily includes <HI>immortality</HI> or <HI>perpetuity</HI>; and &s;ignifies expre&s;sly the &s;ame with our tran&s;lation.

And &s;uch a &s;en&s;e well agrees with the root from which it is derived, meaning to be <HI>hid, concealed</HI> or <HI>&s;ecret</HI>: for mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly nothing is more <HI>hid, concealed,</HI> or <HI>&s;ecret,</HI> with regard to <HI>finite</HI> beings, than <HI>eternity</HI>&mdash;the <HI>eternal</HI> God only excepted.

Whether <HI>Hebrew</HI> was the language of <HI>Eden</HI> or not, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> without doubt did expre&s;s the truth in the mo&s;t proper and &s;ignificant terms.</P>
<P>In &s;upport of what has been now advanced, let it be noted, that <HI>gnolam</HI> is u&s;ed as an epithet whereby to characterize the <HI>true</HI> God, and to di&s;tingui&s;h him from the fal&s;e gods of idolaters. Some of the names by which He was &s;poken of, as <HI>El, Elohim, Elohee,</HI> were given al&s;o to fal&s;e deities and idols; and therefore the term <HI>gnolam</HI> is once and again added when the <HI>true</HI> God is intended, in order to <HI>mark</HI> him out by it; and the attribute, by that term a&s;cribed to him, is con&s;idered as being &s;ufficiently de&s;criptive, and what no other gods could pretend to, their origin being of late date: But if the word <HI>gnolam,</HI> by its own <HI>proper force,</HI> doth not expre&s;s that attribute, on the contrary gains that <HI>&s;pe|cial</HI> meaning from its connexion, how can the appli|cation of it, to a name of God <HI>common</HI> to fal&s;e gods, <HI>de&s;cribe</HI> the true God? The epithet in that ca&s;e does not de&s;cribe the <HI>&s;ubject,</HI> but the &s;ubject the <HI>epithet</HI>; which is contrary to the very <HI>de&s;ign</HI> of epithets.

than <HI>can</HI> belong to the &s;ubject, then the nature of the &s;ubject obliges us to under&s;tand it <HI>figuratively:</HI> but this is widely different from its <HI>gaining</HI> a meaning <HI>in|finitely</HI> beyond what is <HI>proper</HI> to it, by being joined to a name of deity <HI>not peculiar</HI> to the true God, and therefore <HI>not</HI> nece&s;&s;arily implying any thing infinite or eternal in it.

<P>Let us now &s;ee by what words <HI>gnolum</HI> is tran&s;lated in the <HI>Greek.</HI> The <HI>Greek</HI> tran&s;lation of the bible is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been made at <HI>Alexandria</HI> about two hundred and eighty four years before the birth of Chri&s;t, by &s;eventy two of the mo&s;t learned Jews, who were the be&s;t &s;killed in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> lan|guages: for brevity they are u&s;ually called the Seventy, and the tran&s;lation from them the &s;eptuagint. The <HI>Hebrew</HI> term is always (half a &s;core times only ex|cepted) rendered, by the <HI>Greek</HI> noun <HI>aion,</HI> or the adjective <HI>aionios</HI> formed out of it&mdash;by the noun full as many again as by the adjective. The plural of the noun does not occur &s;o often in the &s;eptuagint, as the plural of <HI>gnolam</HI> in the <HI>Hebrew.</HI> In fourteen places the adjective is plural being joined to nouns that are plural, as generations, doors, paths, wa&s;tes, hills, ways and places. The Seventy, as they mu&s;t have attended to <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> and not to <HI>&s;ound,</HI> were of cour&s;e led to u&s;e the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive word or words in the <HI>Greek,</HI> as oft as <HI>&s;trict</HI> and <HI>proper</HI> eternity was meant in the original; and yet, though there is no denying that the <HI>Hebrew</HI> in numerous places intends <HI>&s;trict</HI> and <HI>proper</HI> eternity, not more than a &s;ingle in&s;tance offers where|in they u&s;e any other term than <HI>aion</HI> or <HI>aionios</HI>: that in&s;tance is in Deut 33.27. where mention is made of the <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> arms of the eternal God, which they
<PB N="65" REF="017959_0068_0FA37EAB38EC3C30">
render by a word that &s;ignifies <HI>always flowing</HI> and &s;o <HI>perpetual.</HI> The natural inference is that the Seventy were of opinion that <HI>aion</HI> and <HI>aionios</HI> fully expre&s;&s;ed <HI>&s;trict</HI> and <HI>proper</HI> eternity, and that neither any other &s;ingle word nor any periphra&s;is was wanting in the ca&s;e. It is not &s;trange, that they were of this opinion, when it is recollected that <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> tells us that <HI>aion</HI> is derived from two words that mean <HI>always exi&s;ting.</HI> The etymology is perfectly ea&s;y, and does not labour as often happens in matters of that kind, and is &s;ome|what countenanced by the u&s;e that <HI>Homer</HI> made, five hundred and &s;ixty years before, of the &s;ame words, only altering the la&s;t into the plural number, when &s;peaking of his <HI>immortal</HI> gods.</P>
<P><HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> flouri&s;hed only &s;ixty years before the Septuagint tran&s;lation was made, and died within thirty eight of it; &s;o that the Seventy might be fully informed of his &s;entiment. His own abilities, and having been tutor to <HI>Alexander</HI> the great, gave him an exten&s;ive character; and men of letters were obliged, for their own credit, to &s;eek after and con&s;ult his writings.</P>
<P><HI>Alexander</HI>'s conque&s;ts &s;pread the <HI>Greek</HI> language, and it became common. Of cour&s;e, va&s;t numbers, e&s;pecially of the di&s;per&s;ed <HI>Jews</HI> being better acquaint|ed with the <HI>Greek</HI> than the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> the Septuagint came into general u&s;e, both privately and in their &s;ynagogues; and &s;o continued, until and long after the days of our Saviour and his apo&s;tles, when it was evidently in high e&s;teem. Our Lord's words in Matt. 15.9. "in vain do they wor&s;hip me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men," are the &s;ame with the &s;eptuagint in I&s;. 29.13. and <HI>might be</HI> (tho' it becomes me not to &s;ay <HI>were</HI>) quoted by <HI>Matthew</HI> from that tran&s;lation. The Eunuch we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e u&s;ed the &s;eptuagint, for the words of the prophet I&s;aiah (53.7, 8.) which we are told (Acts 8.32, 33) he read, are
<PB N="66" REF="017959_0069_0FA37EABF8AD3F30">
literally the &s;ame with it. The evangeli&s;ts and apo&s;tles are thought to have followed it often. <HI>Peter</HI> in his addre&s;s to the men of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> quotes the Patriarch <HI>David</HI> &s;peaking concerning the Me&s;&s;iah (Acts 2.25, 26, 27, 28) which is given us in the words of the <HI>Greek</HI> tran&s;lation, &s;omething different from the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> though the &s;en&s;e is much the &s;ame. From the regard thus &s;hewn to the Septuagint, it may be fairly concluded, that <HI>aion</HI> and <HI>aionios</HI> continued to retain the &s;en&s;e in which they were fir&s;t u&s;ed by the Seventy as expre&s;&s;ive of <HI>&s;trict</HI> and <HI>proper</HI> eternity; and in confirmation of their &s;till an&s;wering to the <HI>Hebrew gnolam</HI> let it be noted, that the <HI>Syriac</HI> ver&s;ion of the New Te&s;tament, which was made in the mo&s;t early times, uniformly renders them by the &s;ame term <HI>gnolam.</HI></P>
<P>Now let us &s;earch the New Te&s;tament for the &s;en&s;e of <HI>aion</HI> and <HI>aionios.</HI> "The reader may, if he plea&s;e, look into the <HI>Greek concordance,</HI> and he will there find," that <HI>aion</HI> is to be met with thirty and three times in the Evangeli&s;ts, and <HI>aionios</HI> thirty. And are we to under&s;tand an <HI>eternity</HI> as implied or intended, when our Lord &s;aid (to the fig-tree) let no man eat fruit of thee hereafter for <HI>ever</HI>&mdash;he that &s;hall bla&s;pheme again&s;t the holy Gho&s;t hath not forgivene&s;s for <HI>ever</HI>&mdash;who&s;oever drinketh of the water I &s;hall give him, &s;hall not thir&s;t for <HI>ever</HI>&mdash;if any man eat of the bread which came down from heaven, he &s;hall live for <HI>ever</HI>; he that eateth of this bread &s;hall live for <HI>ever</HI>&mdash;if a man keep my &s;aying he &s;hall not &s;ee death for <HI>ever</HI>&mdash;they &s;hall not peri&s;h for <HI>ever,</HI> neither &s;hall any pluck them out of my hand&mdash;who&s;oever believeth in me &s;hall not die for <HI>ever</HI>"&mdash;then the noun <HI>aion</HI> was rarely u&s;ed by our Saviour in any other &s;en&s;e than as meaning <HI>eternity,</HI> unle&s;s when confined to a different one by an adnoun or the &s;ubject he is

I have not added his words, "the &s;ervant abideth not in the hou&s;e for <HI>ever,</HI> but the &s;on abideth <HI>ever:</HI> and he &s;hall give you another comforter, that he may abide with you for <HI>ever</HI>: and lo I am with you alway unto the end of <HI>the world</HI>;" as it might be di&s;puted, whether more than a certain mea&s;ure of time was in|tended in <HI>any</HI> of the&s;e places. The meaning of the word is limited when he &s;aith, "it &s;hall not be forgiven in <HI>this</HI> world&mdash;the cares of <HI>this</HI> world&mdash;the harve&s;t is <HI>the end</HI> of the <HI>world</HI>&mdash;&s;o &s;hall it be in the end of <HI>this</HI> world&mdash;the children of <HI>this</HI> world." There is no mi&s;taking him when he &s;aith, "in the <HI>world to come,</HI> eternal or everla&s;ting life; and <HI>that</HI> world," in oppo|&s;ition to <HI>this</HI> world. In clo&s;ing that pattern of prayer he gave to his di&s;ciples, commonly called the Lord's prayer, he u&s;es the word in the plural number, "thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory for <HI>ever</HI>:" &s;o did <HI>Gabriel,</HI> when it was told the Virgin "he, i. e. Je&s;us, &s;hould reign over the hou&s;e of <HI>Jacob</HI> for <HI>ever. Mary</HI> u&s;ed it in the &s;ingular, &s;aying, "he hath holpen his &s;ervant <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in remembrance of his mercy for <HI>ever</HI>:" and &s;o did <HI>Zacharias</HI> when he mentions the holy pro|phets which had been <HI>&s;ince the world began</HI>; and <HI>Peter</HI> when he ra&s;hly told our Saviour, "thou &s;halt not wa&s;h my feet for <HI>ever;</HI>" and the man cured of his blindne&s;s when he confounded the Jewi&s;h Sanhedrim by declaring, "<HI>&s;ince the world began</HI> it was not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind." It matters not whether the Jews intended <HI>proper</HI> eternity, when they took notice of their having heard out of the law that Chri&s;t abideth for <HI>ever.</HI> But when they &s;aid, "now we know that thou ha&s;t a devil; <HI>Abraham</HI> is dead and the prophets; and thou &s;aye&s;t, if a man keep my &s;aying he &s;hall not ta&s;te of death for <HI>ever</HI>;" it is plain that they referred to and under&s;tood our

Lord as intending a continued perpetual exi&s;tence, or <HI>immortality</HI>; and it mu&s;t be conceded, that the noun <HI>aion,</HI> as commonly u&s;ed by our Saviour without an ad|noun or &s;pecial &s;ubject to confine its meaning, doth contain in general the idea of perpetuity, or <HI>&s;trict</HI> and <HI>proper</HI> eternity.</P>
<P>Let us in like manner try the meaning of <HI>aionios.</HI> When the young ruler inquired "good ma&s;ter, what &s;hall I do that I may inherit <HI>eternal life</HI>?&mdash;When the lawyer meant to try our Lord's &s;kill in divinity by the &s;ame que&s;tion&mdash;When our Lord told <HI>Nicodemus</HI> that who&s;oever believeth in the &s;on &s;hould have <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> life; and <HI>John</HI> the bapti&s;t declared the &s;ame to his di&s;ciples&mdash;When the woman of <HI>Samaria</HI> was informed that the water which Chri&s;t had to give, would be a well of water &s;pringing up into <HI>everla&s;ting life</HI>&mdash;When the Jews were directed to labour for the meat which endureth unto <HI>everla&s;ting life</HI>; and were told, who&s;o eateth my fle&s;h and drinketh my blood hath <HI>eternal life</HI>&mdash;When <HI>Peter</HI> &s;aid to our Lord, thou ha&s;t the words of <HI>eternal life</HI>&mdash;When Chri&s;t tells us, that he gives unto his &s;heep <HI>eternal life</HI>; and &s;peaking of the Father's commandment to publi&s;h the go&s;pel, &s;ays, and I know that his commandment is <HI>life everla&s;ting</HI>&mdash;When he &s;ays, "thou ha&s;t given him power over all fle&s;h, that he &s;hould give <HI>eternal life</HI> to as many as thou ha&s;t given him; and this is <HI>life eternal</HI> (in the principle and will terminate in it) that they might know thee the only true God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent"&mdash;can any other be intended by <HI>eternal life</HI> than a <HI>glorious immortality</HI>? The adjective <HI>aionios</HI> is joined to <HI>life</HI> twenty five times, by Chri&s;t him&s;elf nineteen, out of the thirty, and in all the&s;e places means <HI>eternal</HI> as including <HI>&s;trict</HI> and <HI>proper</HI> eternity, not to in&s;i&s;t upon <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> habitations (in Luke 16.9.) And yet, if we

will give up our judgments to the di&s;po&s;al of certain interpreters, in the four others, when joined by our Lord to <HI>fire, puni&s;hment</HI> and <HI>damnation,</HI> we are to be|lieve it means nothing more than a <HI>temporary</HI> duration, the <HI>real length</HI> of which &s;carce one of them will under|take to tell us. Such interpretations in direct violation of the general meaning of &s;criptural words are calculated to promote dei&s;m, rather than chri&s;tianity. When revelation is &s;o treated by its friends, no wonder that it is &s;purned by its enemies.</P>
<P>The phra&s;e of <HI>eternal</HI> or <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> life is to be found in the Acts and Epi&s;tles nineteen times, in &s;ixteen of which it al&s;o means a <HI>glorious immortality</HI>; another indeed might be added, for when <HI>John</HI> writes "ye know that no murderer hath <HI>eternal life</HI> abiding in him," he thereby de&s;igns that lively faith and holy obedience with which a <HI>glorious immortality</HI> is connected as the end thereof. The &s;ame apo&s;tle in two other places intends by it Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The adjective <HI>aionios</HI> is u&s;ed twenty and two times more in the Acts and Epi&s;tles; four times in the plural, and eighteen in the &s;ingular number. In the plural by <HI>Paul</HI> when he writes of the my&s;tery, which was kept &s;ecret <HI>&s;ince the world began</HI>; of the grace which was given in Chri&s;t Je&s;us before <HI>the world began</HI>; and of that eternal life which God promi&s;ed before <HI>the world began.</HI> As our cau&s;e is not &s;traiten|ed for evidence, let it be admitted, that the idea of eternity does not enter into any of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages. But when he &s;aith, "the things which are not &s;een are <HI>eternal,</HI>" the connexion and the apo&s;tolic character oblige us to maintain, that <HI>&s;trict</HI> and <HI>proper</HI> eternity is intended: for the&s;e things which are not &s;een are oppo&s;ed to tho&s;e that are <HI>temporal&mdash;temporary</HI> would have been a better word, as expre&s;&s;ive of their in&s;ig|nificant
<PB N="70" REF="017959_0073_0FA37EAEF70CE158">
duration. It was al&s;o beneath the dignity of the great apo&s;tle of the Gentiles, to look, in the &s;en&s;e he meant, at things which had a duration &s;hort of eternity. As in this pa&s;&s;age, he refers to a <HI>proper</HI> eternity, we mu&s;t conclude he does the &s;ame in that which immediately precedes, when he &s;peaks of an <HI>eternal</HI> weight of glory, and in that which follows, wherein we read of an hou&s;e not made with hands <HI>eternal</HI> in the heavens. It is mo&s;t rea&s;onable to believe the like, when he writes of God's having given <HI>ever|la&s;ting</HI> con&s;olation&mdash;when he a&s;cribes to the King of kings and Lord of lords honour and power <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> &mdash;when he mentions, the &s;alvation which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us with <HI>eternal</HI> glory; Chri&s;t's becoming the author of <HI>eternal</HI> &s;alvation unto all them that obey him; the doctrine of <HI>eternal</HI> judgment; Chri&s;t's having obtained <HI>eternal</HI> redemption, and his having offered up him&s;elf through the <HI>eternal</HI> Spirit; the promi&s;e of the <HI>eternal</HI> inheritance, which they that are called receive; and the blood of the <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> covenant. Thus al&s;o when he &s;peaks of the commandment of the <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> God: by which epithet he means rather to mark out the true God by the attribute alluded to; than to expre&s;s that the true God po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed that attribute. But it is a fal&s;e a&s;&s;ertion, that "did we not know, before hand, that eternity was an e&s;&s;ential attribute of God, it could never be argued from the application of this word to him." Indeed did we know, before hand, that it was <HI>not</HI> an e&s;&s;ential attribute of God, it could never be argued that it was, from the application of this word to him: but the application of words may and do convince of tho&s;e truths re&s;pecting God, which we neither did nor could know before hand, as every one mu&s;t allow who believes chri&s;tianity: for till words convinced us we
<PB N="71" REF="017959_0074_0FA37EAFC0905D08">
knew not, before hand, the love of God in providing a Saviour, nor the exceeding riches of his grace in pardoning the greate&s;t of &s;inners. But to return from this digre&s;&s;ion; and admit that the apo&s;tle is not to be under&s;tood as meaning <HI>proper</HI> eternity, when he writes to <HI>Philemon</HI> "perhaps <HI>One&s;imus</HI> departed for a &s;ea&s;on, that thou &s;hould&s;t receive him for <HI>ever</HI>:" however, methinks it is offering an amazing violence to his writings, and taking an unwarrantable liberty with them, to &s;ay, that, becau&s;e, in this la&s;t mentioned place and three others, he might not mean <HI>proper</HI> eternity, therefore he could not mean it, when he makes mention of <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> de&s;truction, though in thirteen other places he u&s;es the term to mark out a <HI>&s;trict</HI> and <HI>proper</HI> eternity. <HI>Peter</HI> &s;peaks of <HI>eternal</HI> glory, and of the <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> kingdom of our Lord and may be allowed to intend a <HI>proper</HI> eternity: but <HI>Jude</HI> is not to meet with the like indulgence when he talks of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrha</HI> and the cities about them, &s;uffering the vengeance of <HI>eternal</HI> fire, though it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that by cities we are not to un|der&s;tand the buildings but the citizens, as is evident from our Lord's declaring, that it &s;hould be more tolerable for <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrha,</HI> in the day of judg|ment, than for that city which would not hear the apo&s;tles. As the <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> go&s;pel in the Revelation may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;o &s;tiled in a <HI>figurative</HI> &s;en&s;e, we &s;hall not employ it in our argument. It may &s;uffice, that the adjective <HI>aionios</HI> is to be under&s;tood fifteen times out of the twenty two, as referring to <HI>&s;trict</HI> and <HI>proper</HI> eternity.</P>
<P>It appears from the preceding paragraphs, that the adjective <HI>aionios</HI> is joined to <HI>life,</HI> one and forty times in the New Te&s;tament, and as often includes <HI>&s;trict</HI> and <HI>proper</HI> eternity, being u&s;ed with that noun
<PB N="72" REF="017959_0075_0FA37EB078CEC538">
to expre&s;s a <HI>glorious immortality.</HI> What a <HI>paltry</HI> quo|tation is that then! "the <HI>bare force</HI> of the word will not &s;upport us, in maintaining an <HI>endle&s;s duration</HI> with re&s;pect, either to the <HI>happine&s;s</HI> of the righteous, or the puni&s;hment of the wicked. We know the <HI>righteous</HI> &s;hall be <HI>happy for ever.</HI> And why! becau&s;e they are &s;aid, in other texts of &s;cripture to be <HI>incor|ruptible, indi&s;&s;oluble, immortal, not</HI> to die <HI>any more,</HI> and the like." Yes; and we &s;hould know it from the numerous declarations made of their being to enjoy <HI>eternal life,</HI> and the like, were the other texts of &s;cripture wanting: for the enjoyment of <HI>eternal life, eternal &s;alvation,</HI> and an <HI>eternal weight of glory,</HI> as nece&s;&s;arily implies <HI>immortality,</HI> as life does being. The original &s;ignifying <HI>indi&s;&s;oluble,</HI> and tran&s;lated <HI>endle&s;s,</HI> is to be found <HI>only</HI> in Heb. 7.16. and has no direct reference whatever to the righteous; but relates to Chri&s;t alone, who is &s;aid to be made a prie&s;t not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after or according to the power of an <HI>endle&s;s life.</HI> It is a vain pretence of &s;ome, that the <HI>endle&s;s life</HI> intends that of believers, which Chri&s;t by virtue of his prie&s;tly office confers upon them: "for as Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> well ob&s;erves, the compari&s;on and oppo&s;ition that is made between <HI>the law of a carnal commandment,</HI> whereby <HI>Aaron</HI> was con&s;tituted a prie&s;t, and <HI>the power of an endle&s;s life,</HI> whereby Chri&s;t was made &s;o, do evidence that the making of Chri&s;t <HI>&s;uch a prie&s;t</HI> as he is, was the <HI>effect</HI> of <HI>this endle&s;s life</HI>: but how can Chri&s;t be <HI>made a prie&s;t</HI> according to the power of that <HI>endle&s;s life</HI> which by <HI>virtue of his prie&s;tly office</HI> he confers on others?" Such pretence makes the <HI>effect</HI> productive of the <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> and then the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> pro|ductive of the <HI>effect</HI>; and forms as complete a circle as ever was travelled by a Popi&s;h di&s;putant. Our Saviour &s;aith, "this is the bread which cometh down

<P>The apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> treating of the re&s;urrection of the righteous, writes concerning the body, "it is &s;own in corruption it is rai&s;ed in <HI>incorruption.</HI> Now this I &s;ay, brethren, that fle&s;h and blood cannot inherit the king|dom of God: neither doth corruption inherit <HI>incor|ruption.</HI> The dead &s;hall be rai&s;ed <HI>incorruptible</HI>; and we &s;hall be changed: for this corruptible mu&s;t put on <HI>incorruption,</HI> and this mortal mu&s;t put on <HI>immortality</HI>; &s;o, when this corruptible &s;hall have put on <HI>incorruption,</HI> and this mortal &s;hall have put on <HI>immortality,</HI> then &s;hall be brought to pa&s;s that &s;aying, Death is &s;wallowed up in victory."

<P>Our Lord did further confirm the opinion of the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> re&s;pecting the perpetuity of future torments, when, a few days before his crucifixion, he clo&s;es his repre&s;entation of the la&s;t judgment with &s;aying, and the&s;e (the accur&s;ed) &s;hall go away into <HI>everla&s;ting puni&s;hment,</HI> but the righteous into <HI>life eternal?</HI> It was impo&s;&s;ible, after what he had taught them before, and con&s;idering the known doctrine of the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> that his di&s;ciples could, without a <HI>particular caution</HI> to direct them, apprehend, that the puni&s;hment of the wicked might, or was to be of &s;horter duration than the life of the righteous, the adjective applied to both being one and the &s;ame in the original; and that <HI>eternal life</HI> was meant to expre&s;s a <HI>glorious immortality,</HI> and nece&s;&s;arily implied <HI>proper</HI> eternity hath been already proved.</P>

Should it be pleaded, that <HI>Paul</HI> makes u&s;e of the word <HI>de&s;truction,</HI> which &s;eems to imply the being put out of exi&s;tence; it is an&s;wered, that <HI>everla&s;ting de&s;truction</HI> evidently means the &s;ame with <HI>everla&s;ting puni&s;hment,</HI> which is &s;tiled <HI>de&s;truction,</HI> not in reference to the wicked's being &s;truck out of exi&s;tence, but to the de&s;truction of all his comforts, when, as the apo&s;tle teaches el&s;ewhere, God &s;hall render to him, by Chri&s;t the Judge, indignation and wrath, tribulation and angui&s;h. Con&s;idering the number of Gentile converts, and that the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation was de&s;igned for all people, had the apo&s;tles thought, that future puni&s;h|ments were not properly eternal, and that the doctrine of eternal puni&s;hments would be a grand ob&s;tacle to the propagating of chri&s;tianity, and that the contrary was a truth which it was profitable upon the whole to proclaim mo&s;t audibly, that every body might hear it, and not have <HI>terrors propo&s;ed to them that exceed belief</HI> &mdash;we mu&s;t conclude that they would have declared them&s;elves freely and explicitly upon the head; whereas they evidently join with their Lord in coun|tenancing and e&s;tabli&s;hing the common opinion of the day, that future puni&s;hments were <HI>really</HI> everla&s;ting. Indeed if they are not &s;trictly &s;o, the u&s;e of the word <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> or <HI>eternal,</HI> always one and the &s;ame in the original (excepting the two places above mentioned where <HI>aidios</HI> occurs) is, not to &s;ay wor&s;e, little le&s;s than trifling; the &s;ame may be ob&s;erved of the terms, <HI>that dieth not</HI> and <HI>that is not quenched.</HI> When it is &s;aid, that the worm <HI>dieth not,</HI> that the fire is <HI>not quenched,</HI> that it is <HI>everla&s;ting,</HI> that the puni&s;hment is <HI>everla&s;ting,</HI> and that the chains are <HI>everla&s;ting</HI>&mdash;the a&s;cription of the&s;e <HI>perpetual</HI> qualities is de&s;igned to excite <HI>&s;pecial</HI> terror; but what <HI>&s;pecial</HI> terror is ju&s;tly excited by

<P>The reader is de&s;ired likewi&s;e to recollect the &s;crip|ture repre&s;entation of the clo&s;ing &s;cene, with which all human affairs fini&s;h.

&s;entence of the upright Judge. And thus all human affairs terminate, and are fixed&mdash;the &s;cene clo&s;es&mdash; and all expectation of a <HI>new &s;tate</HI> of probation, and of a <HI>new</HI> &s;entence is &s;et a&s;ide.</P>

If the wicked may be puni&s;hed in hell, till they become holy and are fit for heaven; then in ca&s;e they become not holy, God can con&s;i&s;tently with his ju&s;tice goodne&s;s and other attributes, puni&s;h them <HI>everla&s;tingly.</HI> Should they be thus <HI>everla&s;tingly</HI> puni&s;hed, it is for &s;ins com|mitted in this world, or becau&s;e of their <HI>continuing to &s;in</HI>: if for the former, then they may be <HI>everla&s;tingly</HI> puni&s;hed for <HI>temporary</HI> crimes: if for the latter, they are continued <HI>perpetually</HI> in a &s;tate of &s;uffering, with|out the divine Being's <HI>preventing</HI> it, through <HI>benevo|lence,</HI> by &s;triking them out of exi&s;tence.</P>

They go to the place of torments with fixed habits of wickedne&s;s.

Do &s;uch puni&s;hments in general take this effect upon earth, that we may look for the like in hell; or is it not the very rever&s;e? From what we know by pre&s;ent experience, may we not fear that the torments of hell will excite rage and rancour of heart, and lead on to the mo&s;t horrid bla&s;phemies? The gentlemen, who hold the Salvation of all men, it is judged, exclude all <HI>po&s;itive</HI> operation of the Almighty in effecting holy di&s;po&s;itions, under the notion of its being incon&s;i&s;tent with moral agency: we mu&s;t not therefore admit of any &s;uch operation in hell; the damned then are left to the full influence of their wicked habits, in a &s;tate that hath a natural tendency to &s;trengthen them; &s;o that we mu&s;t de&s;pair of their ever being made, by &s;uffering, <HI>the willing people of God</HI>; or rather, of their being induced, by their &s;uffering, to <HI>make them&s;elves</HI> &s;o.

<P>No other an&s;wer need be given to Dr. <HI>Hartley</HI>'s a&s;&s;ertion, that "it does not appear from the writings of the mo&s;t ancient fathers, that they con&s;trued the texts that &s;peak of the future puni&s;hment in the <HI>never-ending</HI> &s;en&s;e;" than that Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> writes, "It is really an impo&s;ition upon unlearned readers to pretend, that the doctrine which denies the eternity of the puni&s;hments of hell, was the common &s;en&s;e of the primitive fathers, though it is granted that <HI>Origen</HI> and &s;ome others <HI>might</HI> be of this opinion."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Watts</HI>'s World to come, Vol. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. p. 320. Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> might word him&s;elf thus guardedly "<HI>might be</HI> of this opinion" by rea&s;on of what &s;ome writers on the Controver&s;y have noted, "<HI>that Origen</HI> &s;ignalized him&s;elf by explaining the &s;cripture, and confuting of here&s;ies; <HI>that</HI> whatever enemies he had while living, their hatred of him was not grounded on hetero|dox, or &s;ingular, opinions laid to his charge, but took its ri&s;e from envy at his growing reputation and u&s;efulne&s;s; <HI>that</HI> the common charge again&s;t him was not heard of till a long time after his death, when his writings might be con&s;iderably interpolated and corrupted (as other ancient writings were) <HI>that</HI> his books of <HI>Principles</HI> are extant only in a <HI>Latin</HI> tran&s;|lation not to be depended upon, and tho&s;e publi&s;hed by <HI>Huet,</HI> are commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to be in &s;everal places corrupted; <HI>that</HI> his eight books again&s;t <HI>Cel&s;us,</HI> which he wrote in his old age, and are come down to us rather more pure than any other of his works, contain nothing <HI>clearly favourable</HI> to the opinion a&s;cribed to him, but much that is incon&s;i&s;tent therewith." It has been much que&s;tioned whether <HI>Origen</HI> and <HI>Clement</HI> of <HI>Alexandria</HI> did really and &s;teadily believe, that devils and damned men would be at length re&s;tored to the favour of God. "<HI>Clement</HI> is charged with this by <HI>Le Clerc,</HI> and &s;ome few others. But tho' he refers to <HI>Plato,</HI> as ob|&s;erving, that God inflicts no puni&s;hment but for the good of his creatures, 'tis not deducible from any thing he &s;ays, that he approved of this as true <HI>univer&s;ally.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="017959_0097_0FA37EC0F8696030">It has been already &s;hewn, that <HI>Origen</HI> and <HI>Clement</HI> were notorious for <HI>introducing</HI> into the church the <HI>pagan philo&s;ophy</HI> and <HI>vain deceit,</HI> that Dr. <HI>Hartley</HI> complains of, as what might prove introductory to the belief of the <HI>ab&s;olute eternity</HI> of puni&s;hment: from whence it would rather follow, upon the Dr's rea&s;on|ing, that the <HI>denial</HI> of &s;uch <HI>ab&s;olute eternity,</HI> if truly imputed to <HI>Origen</HI> and <HI>Clement,</HI> was owing to the <HI>pagan philo&s;ophy</HI> and <HI>vain deceit</HI> he alludes to. It would have been much more to the purpo&s;e could the Dr. have &s;aid, that the <HI>denial</HI> of this <HI>never-ending</HI> &s;en&s;e of future puni&s;hment in the ancient creeds, &s;hews that it <HI>was</HI> no <HI>original doctrine</HI>; but the mere <HI>omi&s;&s;ion</HI> of this <HI>never-ending</HI> &s;en&s;e in &s;uch creeds, rather &s;hews that it <HI>was</HI> an <HI>original doctrine,</HI> in&s;tead of the contrary, and that it was generally admitted, and therefore the <HI>in&s;ertion</HI> of it was <HI>needle&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="017959_0098_0FA37EC1C2A47BB0">The contents of the pamphlet entitled <HI>Salvation for, all Men</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. have been, it is hoped, fully and fairly canva&s;&s;ed. May it not be thought, that the following re|flections will occur to one or another upon the occa&s;ion?</P>
<P>The arguments brought to prove the <HI>proper</HI> eternity of hell torments, &s;hould they not &s;ilence every objection, are &s;ufficient to evince the <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>prudence</HI> of not hazarding any thing on the po&s;&s;ibility of the contrary doctrine.</P>
<P>No man of common &s;en&s;e and under&s;tanding can be ju&s;tified in allowing him&s;elf to live in vicious cour&s;es, and other than the &s;criptures pre&s;cribe, on the <HI>per-adventure</HI> that <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> puni&s;hment is no more than a <HI>figurative</HI> expre&s;&s;ion for an <HI>indefinite time</HI>; and on the pre&s;umption of his learning to be holy in hell among devils and damned &s;pirits, &s;hould he omit doing it under all the &s;uperior advantages attending the pre|&s;ent &s;tate of probation.</P>
<P>But &s;hould it be doubted, whether future puni&s;hment is <HI>properly eternal</HI>; yet the <HI>Salvation of all Men</HI> is a <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> &s;ubject, and may be ab&s;olutely fal&s;e, though the damned &s;hould not be always &s;uffering. The evidence of &s;cripture again&s;t the <HI>Salvation of all Men</HI> is &s;o full and expre&s;s, that no dependance can be had upon any doctrine of revelation, if not on that which teaches, that &s;ome individuals will never be admitted to the enjoyment of everla&s;ting happine&s;s. Whatever becomes of them, they will not be &s;uffered to enter the heaven|ly paradi&s;e; or the word of God, is, as the Papi&s;ts tell us, a no&s;e of wax that may be formed into any &s;hape, and requires an infallible interpreter; whom, though they pretend to po&s;&s;e&s;s, they are not agreed in; it being a que&s;tion agitated among them, whether it is the Pope in his own per&s;on, or a general council, or the church diffu&s;&s;ive, or the Pope and a general council in

conjunction. It mu&s;t be the height of folly therefore for a per&s;on to encourage him&s;elf in any evil practice on earth, from the pre&s;ent ea&s;e, plea&s;ure or profit it may afford him, under an apprehen&s;ion, that, after having &s;uffered for a longer or &s;horter period in hell, he &s;hall remove to heaven, where his happine&s;s will be the better flavoured by rea&s;on of the mi&s;eries through which he hath pa&s;&s;ed. Mu&s;t not a conduct of this kind evidence a greater lunacy, than what &s;ub|jects multitudes to confinement!</P>
<P>The pamphlet hath a natural tendency, by holding forth a di&s;tant <HI>never ending</HI> happine&s;s to every one, though wicked in the <HI>highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible</HI> degree, to encou|rage the indulgence of pa&s;&s;ions, &s;ubver&s;ive of family and civil government, and of the mo&s;t de&s;tructive quality: and therefore is in it&s;elf pernicious beyond expre&s;&s;ion, and more e&s;pecially &s;o at the pre&s;ent particular time, wherein liberty hath too univer&s;ally degenerated into licentiou&s;ne&s;s. Whether it hath mended or injured the morals of individuals, and made them better or wor&s;e hu&s;bands, parents, children, neighbours, citizens or chri&s;tians, is not below the attention of tho&s;e that e&s;pou&s;e it.</P>
<P>What can we think of tho&s;e teachers, who, appre|hending the doctrine of <HI>Univer&s;al Salvation</HI> to be &s;criptural (notwith&s;tanding the countenance our Lord and his Apo&s;tles gave to the contrary) undertake to publi&s;h it, as from the hou&s;e-top, for a <HI>whole&s;ome</HI> doc|trine, though they have not the <HI>example</HI> of their Lord and his apo&s;tles to warrant them?&mdash;that they are not arrived at years of <HI>di&s;cretion</HI>? or, that they have pa&s;t them? If happily &s;o grounded in the love of virtue as to need no terrors, they might have con&s;idered more the bulk of mankind, and in mercy to the pre&s;ent world <HI>have had their faith to them&s;elves.</HI></P>
