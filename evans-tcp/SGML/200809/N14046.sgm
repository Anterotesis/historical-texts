<P>THE Committee appointed to take into con&s;ideration the &s;ituation of the State &s;ince the 29th day of December, 1778, report, That the capital and troops in this State were &s;acrificed on the &s;aid 29th of De|cember, which was the fir&s;t cau&s;e of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and con&s;equences which en&s;ued.</P>
<P>Your Committee are of opinion, that the Delegates of this State &s;hould be directed to promote a trial of Major General Howe, who commanded on that day.

<P>I HAVE had the favor of your &s;ummons to attend a Court-Martial, appointed by his Excellency the Commander in Chief to &s;it on the conduct of Major General Howe, on the complaint of the State of Geor|gia. It is not unknown to Major General Howe, or to the Delegates of the State, that I declined to give evidence upon this &s;ubject whil&s;t the pro&s;ecution was in the form of an enquiry, and depo&s;itions taking in the War-Office by order of Congre&s;s, until mea&s;ures &s;hould be taken for obtaining the te&s;timony of Major Ge|neral Elbert, who commanded the Georgia brigade of continental troops on the 29th day of December, 1778, the corps which &s;uffered the mo&s;t by capture on that occa&s;ion: And the &s;acrifice or lo&s;s of the troops being the principal object of the pro&s;ecution, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that the trial would be partial without his evidence; or, at lea&s;t, that implied cen&s;ure might be recorded again&s;t his conduct in the minutes of the Court, which might injure a mo&s;t valuable citizen and &s;oldier of the State. Indeed, I &s;hould think my&s;elf acce&s;&s;ary in the wrong which might take place, did I not plead that the trial might be fait and full, taking in his e&s;&s;en|tial evidence. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, Sir, it is that I have hitherto and do now declined to attend the Court; but when it &s;hall be decided to take General Elbert's te&s;timony before the proceedings are clo&s;e, then &s;hall I chearfully depo&s;e what I know in this ca&s;e. I beg that you would plea&s;e to make my re&s;pects to the Court, and acquaint the members with the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned for my conduct.</P>

<P>WE do our&s;elves the plea&s;ure to reply to your letter of ye&s;terday, and are &s;orry to under&s;tand that the operative powers of the Court are impeded for want of evidence in the ca&s;e of Major General Howe, on the part of the State of Georgia. We are not informed by the Board of War with the time or conveyance of the &s;ummon&s;es &s;ent to General Elbert and Colonel Marbury; and it will appear pretty evident to you, that we have no coercive powers to compel evidence to attend. Under a train of circum&s;tances peculiar in them&s;elves, we cannot pre&s;ume to dictate to the Court; but if difficulties exi&s;t, the propriety of a reference to Congre&s;s will readily occur. We annex the names of &s;uch per&s;ons as have occurred to us &s;ince the deli|very of tho&s;e to the Board of War, who&s;e evidence we wi&s;h to have taken on the trial, in addition to the former.

<P>The Court met according to adjournment.</P>
<P>Major Lucas was &s;worn.</P>
<P>Q. by the Court. Were you in the army in Georgia under the orders of General Howe the latter end of 1778, when the enemy invaded that State?</P>
<P>A. I was.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="017772_0004_0FA2BC42488EA898">Q. In what capacity did you act?</P>
<P>A. As a Captain in the Georgia Line.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know what &s;teps were taken by General Howe to prevent the enemy's landing in that State?</P>
<P>A. I vi&s;ited the po&s;t at Girardeau's landing, where Captain Smith was po&s;ted with about 75 men; my &s;ituation in the army prevented me from &s;eeing the different po&s;ts.</P>
<P>Q. Where did the enemy land?</P>
<P>A. At Girardeau's landing.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know the oppo&s;ition that was made to their landing?</P>
<P>A. No; I heard a firing, but was not pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Q Where was the main body of the army when the enemy landed, and at what di&s;tance was it from the place of landing?</P>
<P>A. At Fair-Lawn, better than a mile from the place of landing.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know what force they landed?</P>
<P>A. No; I under&s;tood, when I was pri&s;oner, that they landed 2500 men at that place.</P>
<P>Q. Did they land at any other place?</P>
<P>A. Not to my knowledge.</P>
<P>Q. Where were you po&s;ted that day?</P>
<P>A. With my regiment in the Georgia brigade, on the left of the line.</P>
<P>Q. After the enemy had landed, did the line move down to oppo&s;e them, or did they wait the enemy's attack?</P>
<P>A. They waited the enemy's attack.</P>
<P>Q. Did the enemy attack them in their po&s;ition at Fair-Lawn, and what re&s;i&s;tance was made?</P>
<P>A. We were po&s;ted in a po&s;ition of defence again&s;t the enemy, the South-Carolina brigade on the right, the Georgia brigade on the left, the artillery in the centre, and a party of militia, under the command of Colonel Walton, on the right of the whole, to oppo&s;e the enemy at a pa&s;s, I think a mile from the main body, where the enemy's infantry did attack them; but a &s;mall re&s;i&s;tance being made by them, enabled the enemy's infantry to attack our right flanks immediately after, at which time the main body moved on, firing a few &s;hot from their artillery, which did &s;ome &s;mall damage in the Georgia brigade; about that time we had orders to retreat, agreeable to the di&s;po&s;ition given the night before, which was by a defile called Spring|hill to M'Gilvray's gate, an advantageous piece of ground.</P>
<P>Q. Was the retreat conducted agreeably to the di&s;po&s;ition?</P>
<P>A. No; the brigade I belonged to moved off in column, and were afterwards ordered by the commanding officer to form by files, and &s;ome time afterwards they broke, and the principal part went into Savanna. Two parties were taken out of the brigade, by order of General Howe, as we were moving in column, to act as infantry on the flanks; the piece of artillery ordered to cover the rear of that brigade quitted its &s;tation, and left the brigade &s;hortly after the retreat began.</P>
<P>Q. By who&s;e orders did the party go into town?</P>
<P>A. I cannot tell.</P>
<P>Q. Was the commanding officer with them?</P>
<P>A. I cannot &s;ay; I being in the front of the brigade moved on; the troops being formed in files, they extended to a great length. Some time after the troops were formed in files, Colonel Elbert left us, as I under&s;tood afterwards, to look for a pa&s;s over M'Gilvray's creek. I arrived at the mouth of the creek with about eighty of the front of the column; for want of orders I &s;taid &s;ome time there, when a &s;uperior officer hoi&s;ted the flag, and &s;urrendered the party.</P>
<P>Q. Who was the officer that &s;urrendered the party?</P>
<P>A. Major John Haber&s;ham.</P>
<P>Q. What number did your brigade con&s;i&s;t of?</P>
<P>A. I can't certainly tell, I believe upwards of 300.</P>
<P>Q. Were only the eighty men you mention, who arrived with you at the creek, included in the &s;urrender of Major Haber&s;ham?</P>
<P>A. The greater part of tho&s;e who went into town had by that time arrived at the creek, and were in|cluded in the &s;urrender.</P>
<P>Q. To what number of troops did Major Haber&s;ham &s;urrender?</P>
<P>A. The greate&s;t part of the enemy's army had by that time arrived.</P>
<P>Q. Did you &s;ee Colonel Elbert, after he left you to look for the pa&s;s?</P>
<P>A. No.</P>
<P>Q. As you were the head of the brigade, what occa&s;ioned the brigade to leave the line of march, point|ed out in the di&s;po&s;ition:</P>
<P>A. Colonel Elbert was at the head of the brigade, when they left the route pointed out in orders.</P>
<P>Q. Did you, from the time you took up the line of march, until the time you left the route laid down in the di&s;po&s;ition, &s;ee General Howe, or either of his Aids, with Colonel Elbert?</P>
<P>A. No.</P>
<P>Q. When your brigade left the route, was the front of it at its proper di&s;tance in the general column?</P>
<P>A. The brigade had halted to form by files; this had occa&s;ioned the brigade to fall about 3 or 400 yards in the rear of the artillery.</P>
<P>Q. Had General Elbert been ab&s;ent from the column from the time you took up the line of march, till you left the route laid down in the di&s;po&s;ition?</P>
<P>A. No.</P>
<P>Q. Was the march by files a part of the general di&s;po&s;ition given out?</P>
<P>A. No.</P>
<P>Q. What time did the firing commence at the landing?</P>
<P>A. About &s;un-ri&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="017772_0005_0FA2BC42F4409A28">Q. by General Howe. Where was the Georgia brigade ordered to break into files?</P>
<P>A. Nigh the burying-ground.</P>
<P>Q. Were there &s;ome roads which led into Savanna not far from the burying-ground?</P>
<P>A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Did you &s;ee me at that place?</P>
<P>A. No; I &s;aw you a little time before pa&s;s the brigade.</P>
<P>Q. Did you hear me &s;peak to the officers and men as I pa&s;&s;ed the brigade?</P>
<P>A. I do not recollect it.</P>
<P>Q. Were the men in good order when I pa&s;&s;ed them?</P>
<P>A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Did you hear me, in general terms, commend the order the troops were in?</P>
<P>A. I think I did.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know of any troops employed to break up the ground in front of the line?</P>
<P>A. Detachments were &s;ent out the night before the action for that and other purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Q. What part of the town did the troops break into?</P>
<P>A. About the centre.</P>
<P>Q. Was the part of the &s;wamp, where the enemy cro&s;&s;ed to attack the militia on the right, commonly known to be pa&s;&s;able?</P>
<P>A. I had always under&s;tood it was impa&s;&s;able.</P>
<P>Q. by the Court. What time did the firing commence on the right with the militia, under Colonel Wal|ton?</P>
<P>A. I can't exactly tell; about two o'clock.</P>
<P>Q. What mea&s;ures were taken to prevent the enemy's advance from the landing, and what oppo&s;ition was made?</P>
<P>A. Several detachments went from the line after the enemy had landed; I do not know for what purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Q. by General Howe. Are you acquainted with the &s;ituation of Girardeau's plantation?</P>
<P>A. I have been there frequently, but am not perfectly acquainted with its &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Q. Is there a large extent of rice-fields before it, and are tho&s;e fields perfectly level?</P>
<P>A. There is an exten&s;ive plain of rice-fields before it.</P>
<P>Q. How wide do you think it is from Girardeau's hou&s;e to the landing-place?</P>
<P>A. I can't really &s;ay; I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e about three quarters or a mile.</P>
<P>Q. Are there any cau&s;eways through that rice-field?</P>
<P>A. There are a great number of banks pa&s;&s;able.</P>
<P>Q. Were you ever in the rice-field?</P>
<P>A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. What nature of ground is the field in general?</P>
<P>A. Wet at times, but pa&s;&s;able for infantry.</P>
<P>Q. When the retreat was ordered, what was the order of march directed?</P>
<P>A. In one column.</P>
<P>Q. Did they move off in that order?</P>
<P>A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. by Court. Was the road through which the column marched practicable for a larger front than a file?</P>
<P>A. Yes; large enough for any platoon.</P>
<P>Q by General Howe. Did the troops keep in good order while they remained in column?</P>
<P>A. They were in perfect good order whil&s;t in column.</P>
<P>Q. When you arrived at the creek, did you attempt to pa&s;s it?</P>
<P>A. No.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know of any action between our troops and the enemy at Springhill defile?</P>
<P>A. I was not there; I heard a firing, which I &s;uppo&s;ed to be there.</P>
<P>Q. Where were you then?</P>
<P>A. Near M'Gilvray's creek.</P>

<P>Nicholas White produced to the Court a general order, appointing him to act as Judge Advocate, <HI>vice</HI> Captain Walker, who&s;e indi&s;po&s;ition obliged him to retire, after which he was &s;worn.</P>
<P>Major Lucas's te&s;timony continued.</P>
<P>Q. by General Howe. Why did you not pa&s;s the creek?</P>
<P>A. For want of orders.</P>
<P>Q. Did you hear from the enemy, when a pri&s;oner, by what means they di&s;covered the pa&s;s on my right?</P>
<P>A. I heard, when among them, it reported, that a Negroe had di&s;covered to the commanding officer the defile by which they pa&s;&s;ed the &s;wamp.</P>
<P>Q. by Court. Whether, from your knowledge of the rice-fields near Mr. Girardeau's hou&s;e, was it ea&s;y to overflow them with water?</P>
<P>A. I cannot tell.</P>
<P>Q. by General Howe. Could you have cro&s;&s;ed the creek with your party, had you been ordered to do it?</P>
<P>A. I could have cro&s;&s;ed my&s;elf by &s;wimming, and &s;uch of my party as could &s;wim, with the lo&s;s of our arms and accoutrements. On my arrival at the creek I met with Captain Day, of the Georgia line, who was then taking off his boots on purpo&s;e to cro&s;s the creek; I a&s;ked him if he had &s;een the commanding officer; he &s;aid he had not, but that I was his commanding officer, and would act as I thought proper; on which he put on his boots and joined me.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="017772_0006_0FA2BC4614C15AC0">Q. Was it before, or upon the retreat, that the damage was done to the Georgia brigade by the enemy's artillery?</P>

The Judge Advocate having a&s;ked Mr. Wereat the different que&s;tions propo&s;ed by the Delegates of the State of Georgia, and he an&s;wering them in the negative, being a private citizen, the Judge Advocate did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;k Mr. Wereat any further que&s;tions on behalf of the pro&s;ecution. Then the following que&s;tions were put by General Howe:</P>
<P>Q. Do you recollect that the inhabitants of the town were advi&s;ed by me to remove their effects, for fear of accident?</P>
<P>A. I believe it was hinted to the inhabitants to provide again&s;t the wor&s;t by removing their effects; that many did remove part of their property, and more would have done &s;o, could they have procured boats and carriages for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know the mora&s;s below Tatnall's gate, in front of the po&s;ition of the troops on the 29th of December, and the ground on the other &s;ide of it?</P>
<P>A. I am well acquainted with the road leading from Savanna by Tatnall's to the place where the enemy landed. Some di&s;tance below Tatnall's gate there is a cau&s;eway through a mora&s;s, or very boggy &s;wamp, which I believe is not pa&s;&s;able for a footman above the cau&s;eway, and but with difficulty below it.</P>
<P>Q. Are you acquainted with that part of the &s;wamp where the enemy pa&s;&s;ed on my right, and if you are, plea&s;e to de&s;cribe it?</P>
<P>A. I knew nothing of the &s;wamp by which the enemy pa&s;&s;ed at that time, but have been through it fre|quently &s;ince. It was not wide, but a thicket, and boggy. The French, at the &s;iege of Savanna, made it pa&s;&s;able, by laying poles acro&s;s it.</P>
<P>Q. What are the landing places above and below my po&s;ition at Fair-Lawn, and is there any approach by Haner's mill, and if there is, where does it come into the town?</P>
<P>A. There were a variety of landing-places, both above and below the place of the enemy's landing at Gi|rardeau's; namely, Co&s;tin's Bluff, Half-moon Bluff, Mulbryne's and Thunderbolt, below, the former called three, and the latter five miles from Savanna by land, and may be &s;omething more. Above, and by way of the Back river, there are Rae's and M'Gilvray's landings, the former five, and the latter two miles by land from Savanna, and five intermediate landing-places between them. All the&s;e landings, both above and below, are on high land, with roads leading from them towards Savanna. There is a road that goes round near Haner's mill, and comes in by the barracks. It was a very good one in September and October 1779.</P>
<P>Q. What is the extent of the rice-field between Girardeau's hou&s;e and the river; are there any cau&s;eways leading through it to the high land, be&s;ide that leading directly to the hou&s;e, and was the rice-field it&s;elf pa&s;&s;able for infantry or not?</P>
<P>A. The di&s;tance from Girardeau's hou&s;e on the high land to the river I believe to be about half a mile, perhaps a little more. I believe there were other banks, be&s;ide the main one, that led directly from the landing to the hou&s;e. The field was exten&s;ive, and the effects of the north-we&s;terly winds, that prevailed for &s;everal days before the approach of the enemy, kept the tides low, and I believe made the rice-field pa&s;&s;able for infantry any where but acro&s;s creeks.</P>
<P>Q. Could the rice-field, about the 29th December, have been ea&s;ily overflown, and would or would not the &s;luices, if they had been overflown, been under the command of the cannon of the enemy's &s;hipping?</P>
<P>A. This que&s;tion is an&s;wered in part by the preceding an&s;wer. The we&s;terly winds always make low tides, and there is no other way of flowing the fields, had the dams and &s;luices been in good order, which I have rea&s;on to believe was not the ca&s;e; but if they were, the enemy had the ab&s;olute command of them by their ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>Q. Did the Governor of Georgia conte&s;t the command with me until after my taking po&s;ition near Tat|nall's hou&s;e?</P>
<P>A. The Governor (Hou&s;ton) of Georgia did contend for the command, and relinqui&s;hed it (as I under|&s;tood and believed) after the enemy appeared in the river, and only a day or two before they landed.</P>
<P>Q. Were the troops halted at Treutlan's plantation, the bridges between that and Savanna pre&s;erved, and were any parties &s;ent down the country for that purpo&s;e?</P>
<P>A. I well remember the halt at Treutlan's about 36 miles above Savanna, either two or three nights, and one night at a plantation about a mile di&s;tant from Treutlan's, to the be&s;t of my recollection. The bridges were not taken up, and I remember to have heard General Howe &s;ay, that he would not put it out of the power of the inhabitants to remove; and from what he &s;aid, I believe the &s;ecurity of the inhabitants and their property was the rea&s;on that the bridges were not de&s;troyed, and I know that much property and &s;ome of the inhabitants were &s;ecured by this precaution. I al&s;o remember that a party of hor&s;e was &s;ent to Ebe|nezer-bridge, as I under&s;tood, to guard that pa&s;s, and give notice of the approach of the enemy.</P>

<P><PB N="8" REF="017772_0007_0FA2BC4727923FC0">Mr. John Gibbons being under the nece&s;&s;ity of leaving the city, the Court were of opinion that his evi|dence and examination &s;hould be taken before one of the Ju&s;tices of the Peace for the city, in the pre&s;ence of Major General Howe and the Judge Advocate, to which Gen. Howe and the Judge Advocate con&s;ented.</P>
<P>Q. by the Judge Advocate. Were you in the army in Georgia under the orders of General Howe the latter end of 1778, when the enemy invaded that State?</P>
<P>A. I was in the militia.</P>
<P>Q. In what capacity did you act?</P>
<P>A. As a private on hor&s;e-back, for the purpo&s;e of reconnoitering.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know what &s;teps were taken by General Howe to prevent the enemy's landing in that State?</P>
<P>A. No.</P>
<P>Q. Where did the enemy land?</P>
<P>A. At Girardeau's landing, commonly called Brewton's plantations.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know the oppo&s;ition that was made to their landing?</P>
<P>A. No; I heard there was a party of men there that fired upon them, and killed two or three of them.</P>
<P>Q. Where was the main body of the army when the enemy landed, and what di&s;tance was it from the place of landing?</P>
<P>A. At a plantation called Fair-Lawn, about a mile from Savanna, and about a mile and a quarter from the place of landing by the main road, and about three quarters of a mile upon a &s;trait line acro&s;s the fields.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know what force they landed?</P>
<P>A. I was told they landed from 2500 to 3000 men.</P>
<P>Q. Did they land at any other place?</P>
<P>A. Not to my knowledge.</P>
<P>Q. Where were you po&s;ted that day?</P>
<P>A. In the fore part of the day, as I was on hor&s;e-back, I was ordered out to reconnoitre, and at the time of action I was with the militia, on the right of the continentals about three quarters of a mile.</P>
<P>Q. How many probable places of landing were there in the vicinity of the town?</P>
<P>A. I cannot &s;ay exactly; but from information, there were &s;everal, both above and below, where they might have landed.</P>
<P>Q. Were there any &s;teps taken to watch the motions of the enemy at tho&s;e places?</P>
<P>A. I was one of a party of mounted militia that was &s;ent down to a place called the Oy&s;ter-hou&s;e, upon Augu&s;tine creek, to watch the motions of the enemy, where we remained one night.</P>
<P>Q. After it was known that the enemy had landed, what mea&s;ures were taken to a&s;certain their numbers, and to oppo&s;e them?</P>
<P>A. I don't know what mea&s;ures were taken to a&s;certain their numbers; but as I was returning from the Oy&s;ter-hou&s;e, I met Colonel M'Into&s;h, with a party of men, po&s;ted about half a mile from where the enemy landed, and about three quarters of a mile from the main army.</P>
<P>Q. Was the place where the enemy landed known in time, and was it defen&s;ible?</P>
<P>A. I don't know whether it was known in time or not, and can't &s;ay whether it was defen&s;ible or not, having never been on the ground.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know what force was &s;tationed there, and the re&s;i&s;tance made?</P>
<P>A. No.</P>
<P>Q. Was the po&s;ition of the army the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible to have been taken for the defence of the town?</P>
<P>A. I cannot &s;ay, not being acquainted with military affairs.</P>
<P>Q. Were the pa&s;&s;es leading indirectly to the town &s;ecured?</P>
<P>A. I don't know.</P>
<P>Q. In what manner did the enemy approach, and what re&s;i&s;tance was made?</P>
<P>A. They came through a &s;wamp oppo&s;ite to where the militia was po&s;ted, and on their di&s;covering the militia they immediately formed, to the number of about 300, and ru&s;hed on, and there was little or no re&s;i&s;tance made by the militia when they broke and di&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>Q. How many of our troops were taken, and in what manner?</P>
<P>A. I was informed there were 300 pri&s;oners taken, and the rea&s;on of it was, they had gone below the pa&s;s at Spring-hill, and could not cro&s;s M'Gilvray's creek.</P>
<P>Q. How many cannon and what &s;tores were lo&s;t?</P>
<P>A. I cannot &s;ay.</P>
<P>Q. When did the army cro&s;s Savanna river, and in what manner?</P>
<P>A. I don't know.</P>
<P>Q. Were the troops at Augu&s;ta and Sunbury ordered to leave the State, and by who&s;e orders?</P>
<P>A. On the night of the 29th of December I met an officer of the rank of Captain, I think his name was Mo&s;eby, who informed me that he was going with orders to the commanding officer at Sunbury to evacuate that po&s;t, by order of General Howe.</P>
<P>Q. by General Howe. Were you with the militia po&s;ted on the right, to oppo&s;e the pa&s;&s;age of the enemy through the &s;wamp on the 29th of December?</P>
<P>A. I was.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know Colonel Walton?</P>
<P>A. Yes; I know him.</P>
<P>Q. Did you &s;ee him at the po&s;t where the enemy cro&s;&s;ed the &s;wamp, or any where in the field in the cour&s;e of that day?</P>
<P>A. I do not recollect that I did, except in the fore part of the day, before the militia took po&s;t at the &s;wamp.</P>
<P>Q. When the militia broke, had the enemy fired on them?</P>
<P>A. I believe not.</P>
<P>Q. In what manner did they quit the field?</P>
<P>A. In a very di&s;orderly and irregular manner, and with the greate&s;t expedition</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="017772_0008_0FA2BC47896FE4C0">Q. Do you know of any orders given by Colonel Walton before or at the advance of the enemy?</P>

<P>Colonel George Walton &s;worn.</P>
<P>Q. by the Court. Were you in the American army in Georgia, at the time the Briti&s;h troops under the command of Colonel Campbell invaded that State?</P>
<P>A. I was.</P>
<P>Q. In what capacity did you act, and under who&s;e command did you conceive your&s;elf to be?</P>
<P>A. As a &s;enior Colonel of the militia of the State, I was under the immediate command of the Gover|nor until the 24th of December, 1778, on which day the Governor, by public orders, relinqui&s;hed the command to Major General Howe, and ordered the militia to receive and obey his orders; which as Colo|nel Commandant of the militia I did, altho' the Governor i&s;&s;ued orders to the militia afterwards.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know how long, previous to the inva&s;ion of Georgia, General Howe received intelligence of the de&s;igns of the enemy, and what &s;teps were taken by him in con&s;equence?</P>
<P>A. Some time about the middle of November, or a few days later, in the year 1778, part of the Briti&s;h troops from Ea&s;t Florida arrived at Sunbury by way of Colonel's i&s;land, while another penetrated the State by land. They evidently expected to have co-operated with a northern force, which not having arrived, they &s;oon retreated. About the &s;ame time, or a few days after, a tran&s;port ve&s;&s;el put into Tybee, which had been &s;eparated from a fleet convoying troops of the enemy from New-York, under the conduct of Colo|nel Campbell; but this ve&s;&s;el al&s;o finding that fleet not arrived, again put to &s;ea, not, however, until &s;he had <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> a man to de&s;ert to us. This man gave a particular and circum&s;tantial account of the fleet and troops coming from New-York, and was generally believed. As a proof, it was made the foundation of an act of the Governor and Council, appointing Dr. Hall and my&s;elf to go to General Lincolt, who was ar|rived or expected at Charle&s;town, in order to communicate this intelligence, as well as the general condition of the State. General Howe being in South-Carolina, and advices of this having been tran&s;mitted to that State, I take it for granted that he had the information as early as others; but when, or by whom he received it, is impo&s;&s;ible for me to tell, and what &s;teps were taken by him in con&s;equence. I cannot a&s;certain pre|ci&s;ely the day on which General Howe arrived at Savanna. It did not appear that he was expected, as it was under&s;tood, by the arrival of the Georgia delegates from Congre&s;s, that he had been recalled from his command in that department, and Major General Lincoln appointed to it. He, however, did come, rea&s;&s;umed the command, and gave a&s;&s;urances that he would defend the town, and that there was little danger. The Carolina troop; which came &s;ome time after united with the troops of Georgia, and an encampment formed in a line, leading from near Tatnall's hou&s;e towards the fort at the Tru&s;tees gardens. And here the army lay until the afternoon of the 29th December, when the enemy made their attack. During this time, General Howe went &s;everal times to reconnoitre Girardeau's hill, Cau&s;tin's Bluff, and the banks of Augu&s;tine creek, lower down. I was with him more than once, and generally under&s;tood that it was his opinion that the enemy would land at Cau&s;tin's Bluff, on account of the landing being good, and approachable by water two ways.</P>
<P>A large wood, which lies between that and the town, I under&s;tood was to have been cut down to ob&s;truct the enemy's progre&s;s by that route; but it was never done.</P>
<P>On the 28th December, in the afternoon, the enemy's ve&s;&s;els &s;ailed up the Savanna river, con&s;iderably above the entrance of Augu&s;tine creek, which looked as if the landing was intended to be higher up; and in the evening, &s;ome time before &s;un-&s;et, the Vigilante with heavy metal, and &s;ome other ve&s;&s;els, ca&s;t an|chor oppo&s;ite Girardeau's cau&s;eway, which operated as a general demon&s;tration of their intention to land there. As the &s;un was &s;etting. I accompanied General Howe and the principal officers of the army down to the Bluff oppo&s;ite. Upon that occa&s;ion I under&s;tood that it was judged that the enemy would land there, and that works were to be thrown up in the night, and the cau&s;eway defended, but it was not done. The only force &s;ent there, I under&s;tood, was a few men in the nature of a picquet. After we returned from the Bluff, I went to the militia which were at the fort, and pre&s;ently afterwards received orders from one of General Howe's family (Major Grimkie I believe) to keep the militia upon the ground where they were un|til morning, and then to move them and take po&s;t to the left of the Georgia brigade, commanded by Gene|ral Elbert; but in the morning I received orders (but whether from the &s;ame Aid or not I do not recol|lect) to remove back in the common and wait further orders, for that the balls from the enemy's ve&s;&s;els fell frequently on Elbert's left, and the militia would be expo&s;ed. As the morning of the 29th opened, the ene|my were &s;een to move from their ve&s;&s;els in boats, and to land at the lower end of the cau&s;eway; and yet no alteration, that I know of or believe, took place in the arrangement and po&s;ition of the American army.
<PB N="10" REF="017772_0009_0FA2BC48367FF338">
The enemy marched along a narrow cau&s;eway, upwards of half a mile in length, with a deep ditch on ei|ther &s;ide, and in fight of the army, without any other oppo&s;ition than what was made by the &s;mall corps or picquet I have mentioned. They a&s;cended a &s;teep bluff, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the highe&s;t grounds about Sa|vanna, and there deliberately formed their army. Being ignorant of what was really intended to be done, and tired with the &s;u&s;pen&s;e in which I had &s;o long remained, &s;ome time in the afternoon I took Colonels Bri&s;|bane and Martin, who had engaged to act with me that day, down upon the bluff on the left of the army, with a view to ob&s;erve the motions of the enemy, who began to make &s;ome tittle parade on the rice-fields, as though an attempt was de&s;igned upon our left by way of the fort. I in&s;tantly formed the conjecture that it was a deception, and that they would attempt our right by the way of the pa&s;s to Milledge's old field, and I immediately determined to order the militia that way, and mentioned it to them, and &s;aid that I would then go to General Howe, let him know what I had done, and my fears of the de&s;igns of the enemy. I pre&s;ently found the General at the right of the army, and immediately a&s;ked him if he was not afraid that the light troops of the enemy would get round upon our right? he told me that he was not, for that he had fortified the only pa&s;s below Tatnall's hou&s;e. I a&s;ked him where that work was? and he pointed to the place. I told him that the enemy would not attempt to cro&s;s the &s;wamp there; that there was a very ea&s;y dry pa&s;s lower down, and more convenient for the enemy. He &s;aid I was &s;urely mi&s;taken, and de&s;ired me to go and look at the work he had cau&s;ed to be thrown up. I rode down, examined it, and returned to the General, repeating what I had fir&s;t &s;aid; and &s;eeing that he had confidence that this work had been thrown up at the proper place, the more certainly to convince him, I made u&s;e of the following expre&s;&s;ions, or words to the like purpo&s;e:
<Q>General, in order that you may be convinced that what I &s;ay to you is true, I a&s;&s;ert to you, upon my honor, that before the war I have frequently cro&s;&s;ed the pa&s;s I mean in a chair, with young ladies, picking je&s;&s;amines.</Q>
This had the de&s;ired effect; he appeared convinced, a&s;ked me where my regiment was; I told him I had moved it to the right; he thanked and de&s;ired me to go and reconnoitre the pa&s;s I had mentioned. I in&s;tantly went off, and as I entered the &s;wamp along that pa&s;s, I perceived the Briti&s;h light infantry hopping over the little difficulties with great agility. I was perceived, but not fired at. Fore&s;eeing that the enemy would be &s;oon round, I rode full &s;peed with the intelligence to the ground where the militia hor&s;e were po&s;ted, and &s;ent it to General Howe (but by whom I do not recol|lect, I believe there were &s;everal that rode off with it) and followed immediately after my&s;elf, and reported to the General him&s;elf, that the enemy were in force on our right. I was ordered to the militia, in the front of which, at about 70 or 80 yards, the enemy formed the line of two deep, in numbers, as appeared then and &s;ince, about 350. Once or twice a field piece had already been di&s;charged at the enemy, and &s;ome execution done, when Colonel Marbury rode up and told me, that General Howe ordered me to attack the light infantry immediately. I told him the field-piece was already directed again&s;t them, and, pointing to the &s;mallne&s;s of my numbers, which was then under 100 men, and at the time in &s;ome little confu&s;ion, ad|ded, I beg you to give my compliments to the General, and a&s;&s;ure him that I will do every thing in my power; but I do mo&s;t earne&s;tly entreat that he will either wheel one of the brigade's round, or only &s;uc|cour me with a &s;ingle company of continental troops, to countenance the militia. He went off, and pre|&s;ently after the enemy in my front opened their line, and commenced a heavy fire of mu&s;ketry upon my &s;mall corps, which obliged it to retire, and which it did in &s;afety, &s;ave tho&s;e killed or maimed upon the field. Having a thigh broke in the action, I took the re&s;olution of endeavouring to get into town, and cro&s;&s;ed the General in his retreat, the whole army having been removed from their field po&s;ition without waiting the attack of Colonel Campbell, except artillery, or turning the right, and attacking the light infantry under Sir James Baird.</P>
<P>The Court adjourned till to-morrow morning, ten o'clock.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="proceedings of the day">
<HEAD>JANUARY <HI>5</HI>th.</HEAD>
<P>The Court met agreeable to adjournment.</P>
<P>Colonel Walton's te&s;timony continued.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know what force the enemy landed?</P>
<P>A. From all the information which had been received, it appeared that the 71&s;t Briti&s;h regiment and Delancey's brigade of American recruits were part of the enemy's army, by which it was concluded by every body that they were in force. From the fort where the militia were in the dawn of the morning of the 29th, the enemy's light infantry were plainly &s;een to land at the lower end of the cau&s;eway, and to march up and take po&s;t at the Bluff, where the &s;mall number of troops or picquet was po&s;ted. I have al|ready mentioned what their numbers were. I did not perceive that any more troops were landed until they gained that po&s;t, and then the debarkation continued until the invading army was compleated, which ap|peared to be about two o'clock in the afternoon, to the be&s;t of my recollection. I do not know their num|bers, but believe them to have been 2000 at lea&s;t. I under&s;tood, that before they advanced the enemy had been reconnoitered by Major Moore, and that he reported to the General that there were upwards of 3000 men.</P>
<P>Q. What was the compo&s;ition and number of the army under General Howe?</P>
<P>A. The army under the command of Major General Howe was compo&s;ed of a brigade of continental troops from South-Carolina, the Georgia brigade, and the militia under my command. The number of either of the brigades I do not know, and by con&s;equence neither their amount when combined; but I believe the whole together were le&s;s than 1000 men, including Colonel Roberts's artillery, which I forgot to mention.</P>
<P>Q. In what manner did the main body of the enemy approach, and what re&s;i&s;tance was made?</P>
<P>A. I have already mentioned, that I had formed the conjecture &s;ome time in the afternoon of that day, that the enemy intended to endeavour to gain our right by Milledge's pa&s;s; and of cour&s;e I expected that the main body would approach our line by the road leading from Savanna to the Governor's gate, as a brigade of ours was po&s;ted on either &s;ide of that road, while the artillery was placed in its centre. When the light infantry had gained the pa&s;s on the right, and had received a fire from the field piece with me,
<PB N="11" REF="017772_0010_0FA2BC48F4261130">
it appeared that the enemy's artillery, taking this for the &s;ignal, was advanced, and began to play at long &s;hot upon our line, which I under&s;tood was done by our artillery at the &s;ame time. No doubt the infantry was al&s;o advancing, but not being pre&s;ent, I could not &s;ee them. I always under&s;tood, however, and be|lieve that the retreat was ordered and in execution before they came within fighting di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Q. When, and in what manner did the army retreat?</P>
<P>A. That part of the army with me retreated towards the Spring-hill and Sheftall's tan-yard; but being unable to proceed with them, I turned off towards town. I under&s;tood they retreated by tho&s;e routes. About midway from the &s;outh-we&s;t corner of the town and the Spring-hill, being faint, I was taken from my hor&s;e. After recovering, which was almo&s;t immediately, I perceived &s;cattered troops and citizens out of the town running and riding in great di&s;order towards that hill. The mu&s;ket-bullets then began to reach the place where I lay, but &s;eemed to be &s;pent. Before I was taken down, one of General Howe's Aids (Captain Turner) pa&s;&s;ed me, going towards the hill; and pre&s;ently after the General him&s;elf. Major Grim|kie and &s;ome others came up. I then learned that the day was wholly unfortunate. Having found my&s;elf better, and the light infantry which had driven the militia from their ground having pu&s;hed in towards the town, with an evident view to cut off the rear of our army, I de&s;ired the General to leave me, and was put again upon my hor&s;e, and proceeded as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible to Mr. Watts's, in Yamacraw. Ju&s;t as I got there, I &s;aw a number of the Georgia troops running along the &s;treet towards Nunez's creek in the like confu&s;ion. I did then &s;uppo&s;e that &s;ome mode of cro&s;&s;ing it had been e&s;tabli&s;hed, as it was a work of &s;carce an hour, by throwing over it a piece of &s;cantling; but I under&s;tood &s;oon afterwards that many of them were captured upon its banks, it not having been then, or indeed at any other time fordable.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are &s;orry to under&s;tand, that the indi&s;po&s;ition of General Elbert is like to prevent his attendance as an evidence on the trial of Major General Howe. Should that be the ca&s;e, we are hopeful the Court will direct his depo&s;ition to be taken, before the clo&s;e of the trial, upon the interrogatories that were given in by us to the Board of War, in behalf of the State of Georgia. We are, Sir,</P>

<P>I HAD the honor of receiving your letter of the 4th in&s;tant, and beg leave to acquaint you, that the opinion of the Court is, that the propo&s;ition therein contained is inadmi&s;&s;able, it being contrary to the u&s;age and cu&s;tom in like ca&s;es; and that they have taken every &s;tep in their power to obtain the evidence of Ge|neral Elbert, but find, by a certificate received from the Doctors attending him, that he is not in a condition to travel. I am, Gentlemen, with great re&s;pect,</P>

<P>The Court adjourned till Tue&s;day morning, ten o'clock.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="proceedings of the day">
<HEAD>JANUARY <HI>8</HI>th.</HEAD>
<P>The Court met agreeable to adjournment. Major Dexter &s;worn as a Member, in the room of Major Moore, who&s;e indi&s;po&s;ition obliged him to retire.</P>
<P>Colonel Walton's te&s;timony continued.</P>
<P>Q. What wat the lo&s;s in men, cannon and &s;tores, and by what means were they lo&s;t?</P>
<P>A. I do not know particularly the lo&s;s in either. I have &s;een a return made by each of the Brigades, the amount of both was &s;omewhere about 300, tho' I do not exactly recollect; they were chiefly lo&s;t by capture. The army were kept with an apparent view of fighting the enemy; but the enemy having got in the rear of the right of the line before any attack was made in front, the continental line was ordered to retreat. Before it was effected, the enemy on our right defeated the militia under my command, and part of them pu&s;hed in upon their flank. I afterwards &s;aw the rear broken and retreating towards Nunez's, as I have before men|tioned. I believe that mo&s;t of the cannon in the town and in the field were lo&s;t; how many were &s;aved I cannot tell, being a pri&s;oner. The one with the militia was abandoned upon being overpowered by the ene|my. With regard to tho&s;e in the town, as well as the &s;tores in general, they appeared to me to have been lo&s;t by the jealou&s;ies and a &s;upinene&s;s which characterize and tincture the tran&s;actions of that time. Mutual applications, complaints and reproaches, between the Governor of the State and the General, took place of real exertion, and the cannon and &s;tores were not removed; in con&s;equence fell into the enemy's hands.</P>
<P>Q. When did the army cro&s;s Savanna river, and in what manner?</P>
<P>A. I don't know.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know of any orders given to the troops at Augu&s;ta and Sunbury to leave the State?</P>
<P>A. No; I do not po&s;itively.</P>
<P>Q. What were the number of militia belonging to the State of Georgia?</P>
<P>A. In the year 1773, Government ordered a return of the men to be made from the age of 16 to 60, as I recollect, and by that return it appears that there were two thou&s;and five or &s;ix hundred men, the preci&s;e number I do not recollect. Since that return was made, there was a con&s;iderable augmentation of inhabi|tants to the we&s;tward, but I do not believe they made up for the number of fugitive tories that &s;ought pro|tection from the enemy from the lower country. So that I &s;uppo&s;e that at that day the number of fighting men might be nearly equal with that returned in 1773, or not &s;o much.</P>
<P>Q. When the inva&s;ion of Georgia took place, what proportion of militia was reque&s;ted by General Howe of the executive authority?</P>
<P>A. I do not know.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="017772_0011_0FA2BC4B9A7BA1F0">Q. Do you know the numbers actually in the field at that time?</P>
<P>A. The pro&s;pect of lo&s;ing the town and the neighbouring country, I believe, prevented many from join|ing the army, they being employed in removing their families and property from the more &s;outhern parts, except about Sunbury, as well as in the neighbourhood of Savanna; and whether tho&s;e from the we&s;tward had been called for in tim I do not know, but there were a very &s;mall proportion in &s;ervice upon that oc|ca&s;ion. What number were in arms with the corps at Sunbury I do not know. I had under my command at Savanna, including infantry, artillery and the company of hor&s;e, which I did not include in my former e&s;ti|mation, &s;omething above 100 men; the preci&s;e number I cannot a&s;certain. I believe another cau&s;e why the militia was backward upon that occa&s;ion was, the di&s;putes already &s;ugge&s;ted between the Governor and Ge|neral.</P>
<P>Q. Was the army provided with tools to erect the works propo&s;ed at Girardeau's Bluff?</P>
<P>A. I do not know.</P>
<P>Q. You mention your party being in confu&s;ion at the time you were ordered to attack the Briti&s;h light in|fantry. What was the occa&s;ion of that confu&s;ion?</P>
<P>A. The &s;uperior numbers of the enemy who were drawn up in front.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know of any previous di&s;po&s;itions made by General Howe in ca&s;e of retreat?</P>
<P>A. I do not, I never received any orders to retreat.</P>
<P>Q. Did you &s;ee the General's orders i&s;&s;ued previous to the affair of the 29th?</P>
<P>A. I did not; the only general order I &s;aw was that putting the militia in general orders <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> conti|nental command, to the be&s;t of my recollection.</P>
<P>Q. How far is Milledge's pa&s;s from the po&s;t then occupied by the main body of General Howe's army?</P>
<P>A. I have already &s;aid that the head of the &s;econd branch was about a mile di&s;tant from town, and from thence about half a mile to the pa&s;s; &s;o that the pa&s;s being about a mile and an half from town, in the circuit of the path, and the po&s;ition of General Howe's main body being below the town, the circuit would be continued about one quarter of a mile farther; therefore, to the be&s;t of my judgment, the di&s;tance was about one mile and three quarters.</P>
<P>Q. What was the general face of the country over which the enemy pa&s;&s;ed to make their attack?</P>
<P>A. In the front of the American line lay a bed or row of &s;prings, which formed to the le&s;t a gut extending to the river, whil&s;t tho&s;e which lay more to the right make a mar&s;h in the oppo&s;ite direction. Immediately below Tatnall's fence, it a&s;&s;umes the appearance of a &s;wamp (by which I mean low, watry and miry ground, largely wooded and thickly underbru&s;hed.) At the commencement of this &s;wamp, that is a little below Tatnall's fence, was the &s;mall work which the General had cau&s;ed to be thrown up on his right, and which, by his de&s;ire, I examined. To the right of that work, about half a mile, to the be&s;t of my judgment, though I never traver&s;ed it in a direct line, is the pa&s;s acro&s;s the &s;wamp to Milledge's old field. The dull way or path which leads from town to this pa&s;s begins its cour&s;e about oppo&s;ite the burying-ground, and con|tinues in a &s;outhern direction until it gains the head of a &s;econd mar&s;hy branch, about one mile di&s;tant from town, to the be&s;t of my judgment. It then turns down that branch in a north-ea&s;t direction to the pa&s;s, in di&s;tance about half a mile, to the be&s;t of my judgment. From the other, or ea&s;tern &s;ide, to the Governor's gate, is about three quarters of a mile, or not quite &s;o much, at which place the path u&s;ed to enter the great road; but latterly, and before that day, mo&s;t of the old fields, and all the ground lying between that and the gate, had been enclo&s;ed and under cultivation. At this cro&s;&s;ing-place, the waters appear to me to have forced them&s;elves into a &s;ingle bed, and to form a kind of running branch of creek, over which there appears to have been once a wooden bridge; but &s;ince my remembrance, there were only two or three &s;leep|ers or logs acro&s;s. On my way from reporting to the General, and before I got quite up to my command, Colonel William M'Into&s;h, who commanded the hor&s;e that day, cried out that the enemy were cro&s;&s;ing the branch, which I that moment perceived. It was the branch neare&s;t to town, and the place they cro&s;&s;ed &s;ome little di&s;tance below the path-way, &s;ay about 100 or 150 yards. I take it, they &s;tept over upon roots and high tufts, which are common in the mar&s;hy branches of that country. Upon their cro&s;&s;ing this branch, I neither went or &s;ent to the General, becau&s;e, from the intelligence I had already given, it was an event he mu&s;t have expected, and that it would have been pre&s;ently announced by firing.</P>
<P>Q Did you ever mention to General Howe Milledge's pa&s;s previous to the day of action?</P>
<P>A. I do not remember to have mentioned it to him until the time I have already mentioned. The fir&s;t object was to guard again&s;t the enemy's landing, which occupied my mind; and after they had landed at Girardeau's, I was not with the General until the time I have mentioned, as I recollect. When I went down, in the anxiety I have heretofore related, the fir&s;t enquiry was re&s;pecting that pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Q. What were the rea&s;ons that prevented your &s;eeing the general orders on the day of attack?</P>
<P>A. I know of no particular rea&s;on; the militia had but lately been put under continental command, and I was not in the practice of going for orders, nor were they &s;ent to me.</P>
<P>Q. Whether the &s;hores above Nunez's creek were equally practicable for the enemy to land as tho&s;e below?</P>
<P>A. The &s;hores or bluffs above Nunez's creek are not &s;o &s;teep and abrupt as the hill at Girardeau's; but the navigation to them is much more difficult. Mu&s;grove's or Nunez's creek was more difficult to cro&s;s by an enemy, than the ob&s;truction below the town.</P>
<P>The Court adjourned till to-morrow morning, ten o'clock.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="proceedings of the day">
<HEAD>JANUARY <HI>9</HI>th.</HEAD>
<P>The Court met agreeable to adjournment.</P>
<P>Colonel Walton's te&s;timony continued.</P>
<P>Q. Was the town of Savanna fortified in any degree?</P>
<P>A. The town it&s;elf was not fortified. At the north-ea&s;t point of the Tru&s;tees gardens, a fort had been &s;ome con&s;iderable time before erected, and &s;ome pieces of 18 pound cannon and others of le&s;s &s;ize planted in it, for the evident defence of the town. I do not recollect any other works, except tho&s;e &s;lightly thrown up in the field upon that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="017772_0012_0FA2BC4CAA9DF150">Q. When General Howe gave a&s;&s;urance of defending the town, did you under&s;tand from him upon what principles he meant to defend it?</P>
<P>A. I do not know the principles upon which the defence of the town was undertaken, in any military point of view. I heard General Howe &s;ay, in pre&s;ence of a number of the inhabitants of the town, on the 23th or 26th preceding the attack, I forget which, that the enemy's army was compo&s;ed of raw boys from the Highlands and of Delancey's green-coats, who would not fight, and that he did not care if they were double the number.</P>
<P>Q. by General Howe. Do you know at what time the Governor of Georgia informed me that the militia was under my command?</P>
<P>A. The orders by which the militia were put under continental command were dated the 24th December, and the next day, to the be&s;t of my recollection, the militia were put in general orders; hence I conclude that the General mu&s;t have been informed the evening of the 24th.</P>
<P>Q. Did any body of militia join you, be&s;ides tho&s;e of your own regiment?</P>
<P>A. About 20 men, a few more or le&s;s, I cannot recollect, came down from the neighbourhood of Ebene|zer; but whether they were with me on the day of attack or not I forget. Some gentlemen from the coun|try were volunteers.</P>
<P>Q. Did you proceed with Dr. Hall to South-Carolina, agreeable to the re&s;olution of the Governor and Council.</P>
<P>A. I did not. Dr. Hall was not at fir&s;t ready, and when he was, I de&s;ired him to proceed; that having much better hor&s;es, I could go much fa&s;ter: The evening preceding the day I was to have &s;et out, an expre&s;s arrived from Skidaway, announcing the arrival of a fleet upon the coa&s;t. I then deemed it improper to leave my regiment.</P>
<P>Q. When General Provo&s;t fir&s;t penetrated the State of Georgia with troops, did I repair to that State?</P>
<P>A. I have already mentioned that General Howe was in South-Carolina, and expected to go to the north|ward. When the troops from Ea&s;t-Florida fir&s;t came into the State, neither the General nor General Elbert was in the State. He came, as I now recollect, &s;oon after the retreat of the enemy from pur&s;uing our troops to Ogechee hill.</P>
<P>Q. Was I with the troops at the &s;outh &s;ide of Ogechee river, when you were there with the militia?</P>
<P>A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. When you and your party returned, did you not leave me at that place?</P>
<P>A. I remember that the militia under my command did duty upon the hill at Ogechee with the continen|tal troops under the command of Major General Howe, and I believe when they returned the army was left upon that ground.</P>
<P>Q. After the report &s;uppo&s;ed to be from a de&s;erter, was a body of Carolina militia, under the command of Colonel Bull, marched to Savanna?</P>
<P>A. I remember that Colonel Bull came over into Georgia with a body of South-Carolina militia; but I do not recollect the particular time, or upon who&s;e application they came over.</P>
<P>Q. Were a detachment of Carolina continental infantry and artillery marched into Georgia, &s;ub&s;equent to a report of an intended inva&s;ion, and previous to the inva&s;ion?</P>
<P>A. With regard to the fir&s;t, I do not know when any continental artillery or infantry were marched into Georgia, &s;ub&s;equent to the report of an inva&s;ion; previous to the attack both infantry and artillery arrived. There might have been a detachment there &s;ooner.</P>
<P>Q. Did any con&s;iderable time elap&s;e after a report made by the de&s;erter, without any further intelligence of an inva&s;ion?</P>
<P>A. I cannot a&s;certain the preci&s;e time.</P>
<P>Q. Was any other information received by the State of an inva&s;ion, be&s;ides that of the de&s;erter?</P>
<P>A. At this di&s;tance of time I do not recollect what particular informations were received. The inva&s;ion was generally expected.</P>
<P>Q. Did the Governor and Council receive information from any per&s;on of the tran&s;port ve&s;&s;el, except from the de&s;erter already mentioned?</P>
<P>A. I do not know the nature of the information received by the Governor and Council, nor from whom, not having been a member.</P>
<P>Q. Were not the apprehen&s;ions of an inva&s;ion in a great mea&s;ure &s;ub&s;iding?</P>
<P>A. Not that I know or believe.</P>
<P>Q. Were the Carolina militia, after remaining &s;ome few days at the barracks, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed?</P>
<P>A. I was chiefly out of town about that time, and do not know whether or by whom they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. They went &s;oon away.</P>
<P>Q. Were any regiments of militia of the State of Georgia, &s;ub&s;equent to the report of an inva&s;ion, called forth by the State, and kept embodied?</P>
<P>A. I don't recollect that I knew what Government did about that time as to ordering the militia to be em|bodied, but there was none in actual &s;ervice, except parts of my regiment occa&s;ionally.</P>
<P>Q. As you were in the A&s;&s;embly, did you &s;ee any official letters of mine to the Legi&s;lature of the State, pointing out the weakne&s;s of it, and pre&s;&s;ing upon them the nece&s;&s;ity of fortifying it?</P>
<P>A. I have &s;een &s;everal letters of the General to the Legi&s;lature of that State, without being able to advert to their particular objects; I believe one was advi&s;ing fortifications.</P>
<P>Q. After General Prevo&s;t retreated, previous to the arrival of Colonel Campbell, have you any knowledge of my applying to the Governor for hands, tools, and other materials for fortifying the State?</P>
<P>A. I do not recollect to have had any particular knowledge of particular applications, but I verily believe that applications were made.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know whether the Negroe you met acted as a guide to the enemy?</P>
<P>A. I looked upon him to be in the &s;ervice of the enemy.</P>
<P>Q. Were there not various landing-places above the town of Savanna, which were acce&s;&s;ible by the back river?</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="017772_0013_0FA2BC4CBB805490">A. I have already &s;aid, or meant to &s;ay, there were.</P>
<P>Q. Did any part of the hor&s;e remain with the militia on the right that day?</P>
<P>A. When the enemy cro&s;&s;ed the branch and formed, I a&s;ked for the hor&s;e, and was told by Colonel M'In|to&s;h that they had all been &s;ent different ways by the General. I had none at that time as I &s;aw or recollect, except Colonel M'Into&s;h and Mr. O'Brian.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="proceedings of the day">
<HEAD>JANUARY <HI>10</HI>th.</HEAD>
<P>The Court met agreeable to adjournment.</P>
<P>Major Benjamin Porter &s;worn.</P>
<P>Q. Were you in the army in Georgia, at the time the Briti&s;h troops under the command of Colonel Camp|bell invaded that State?</P>
<P>A. I was.</P>
<P>Q. In what capacity did you act?</P>
<P>A. As a Major in the Georgia line previous to the inva&s;ion, and on the 29th of December acted as a vo|lunteer Aid with General Howe, having re&s;igned my commi&s;&s;ion in the line five or &s;ix weeks before.</P>
<P>Q. What &s;teps were taken by General Howe to prevent the enemy landing?</P>
<P>A. The troops were drawn up on a piece of ground called Fair-Lawn, nearly as &s;ome gentlemen have re|pre&s;ented who were examined before me, and &s;ome guards po&s;ted between Fair-Lawn and Girardeau's land|ing, and I believe one at the landing, as I heard a firing which appeared to be at that place.</P>
<P>Q. Where did the enemy land?</P>
<P>A. At Girardeau's landing.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know what force the enemy landed?</P>
<P>A. I do not.</P>
<P>Q. What was the compo&s;ition and number of the army under General Howe?</P>
<P>A. The number I do not certainly know, but I believe they were about 600, exclu&s;ive of the militia; they con&s;i&s;ted of the Georgia and South-Carolina troops.</P>
<P>Q. In what manner did the main body of the enemy approach, and what re&s;i&s;tance was made?</P>
<P>A. The enemy fir&s;t approached in front of our troops, but very little re&s;i&s;tance was made, as the troops retreated immediately after it was known the enemy were gaining our right.</P>
<P>Q. When, and in what manner did the army retreat?</P>
<P>A. The army retreated immediately after I reported to General Howe that the enemy were gaining our right, and in column, the South-Carolina in front, the artillery in the centre, and the Georgia in the rear.</P>
<P>Q. What was the lo&s;s in men, cannon and &s;tores, and by what means were they lo&s;t?</P>
<P>A. I don't know.</P>
<P>Q. When, where and in what manner did the army cro&s;s Savanna river?</P>
<P>A. The army cro&s;&s;ed Savanna river at the Si&s;ters a few days after the 29th in boats.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know of any orders given to the troops at Augu&s;ta and Sunbury to leave the State?</P>
<P>A. I do not.</P>
<P>Q. Was there any confu&s;ion in the retreat?</P>
<P>A. Not the lea&s;t confu&s;ion among the continental troops as long as I &s;taid with them, having left them near the burying-ground, at 3 or 400 yards from where the retreat commenced, and went into Savanna to di&s;patch my &s;ervant with my baggage, whom I ordered to hold him&s;elf in readine&s;s.</P>
<P>Q. by General Howe. What was the fir&s;t duty you were &s;ent upon, after being an extra Aid to me?</P>
<P>A. To reconnoitre the enemy and the ground between Fair-Lawn and Girardeau's landing.</P>
<P>Q. What guards were between the troops at Fair-Lawn and the enemy?</P>
<P>A. There was one on the road leading to Girardeau's hou&s;e, another in a wood &s;till nearer to it, and I heard of and believe there was another at the landing before mentioned, as I heard a firing which appeared to be at that place.</P>
<P>Q. What was the di&s;tance from the po&s;ition at Fair-Lawn to the place where the enemy landed?</P>
<P>A. About a mile and a half.</P>
<P>Q. What is the di&s;tance between Girardeau's hou&s;e and the landing place, and what is the nature of the ground?</P>
<P>A. I &s;uppo&s;e it may be about 500 yards from the landing place to Girardeau's hou&s;e; there was a cau&s;e|way leading directly from the landing to the hou&s;e; there were &s;everal ditches al&s;o leading thro' a rice-field different ways; the dirt thrown out of them made banks which appeared dry enough to walk on; &s;o appear|ed the field to be generally, tho' I was not on the field.</P>
<P>Q. Did the enemy's &s;hipping command the landing-place?</P>
<P>A. Yes; I think effectually.</P>
<P>Q. Are you acquainted with the mora&s;s in front of our po&s;ition at Fair-Lawn, what is the nature of it, and of the ground on each &s;ide of it?</P>
<P>A. I think I am acquainted with the nature of the ground, as I cro&s;&s;ed the creek in front of our troops that were drawn up near the mora&s;s, which appeared to me deep, and impracticable for troops to cro&s;s in or|der. After the bridge was taken up, I found difficulty in getting my hor&s;e over, tho' planks were laid down for that purpo&s;e. The mora&s;s on each &s;ide of the creek, e&s;pecially on the &s;ide of Fair-Lawn, appeared very boggy, and I think impa&s;&s;able for troops.</P>
<P>Q. Could the mora&s;s directly in our front be &s;een by per&s;ons approaching it until they came near it?</P>
<P>A. I think not, as the mora&s;s was wide, the de&s;cent &s;udden, and at a di&s;tance appeared like a plain.</P>
<P>Q. Did you, from any conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed between us, or from any other circum&s;tance, under&s;tand whether or not I was acquainted with the pa&s;s of which the enemy availed them&s;elves?</P>
<P>A. I thought you were acquainted with the ground from your &s;ending me &s;everal times to vi&s;it it, and from your &s;eeming apprehen&s;ive of danger, &s;hould the enemy pa&s;s that way. I don't know certainly to this minute where the enemy did pa&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="017772_0014_0FA2BC4D8FE67710">Q. Did I or did I not expre&s;s to you my apprehen&s;ion of the enemy pa&s;&s;ing on my right, and de&s;ired you and Major Dehey&s;er alternately to watch them clo&s;ely?</P>
<P>A. I don't recollect any particular conver&s;ation on that &s;ubject, but well remember you &s;ent Major Dehey|&s;er and my&s;elf to examine the ground, which we did, and reported to you.</P>
<P>Q. Was there any hor&s;e po&s;ted that way?</P>

<P>A. Yes; I &s;aw &s;ome hor&s;emen riding through the wood between where the party of hor&s;e was and the &s;wamp.</P>
<P>Q. When I was informed that the enemy was gaining my right, what &s;teps were taken?</P>
<P>A. I remember to have informed General Howe the enemy had pa&s;&s;ed the &s;wamp on our right, when he ordered a retreat, and &s;ent me to take off a picquet which was po&s;ted on our right, and direct the officer to take the neare&s;t route on the flanks of our army to Spring-hill defile.</P>
<P>Q. Were the orders for retreat given previous to any firing, or afterwards?</P>
<P>A. Previous to any firing, except from Colonel Roberts's artillery, at a party of the enemy directly in front, as well as I recollect.</P>

<P>Q. By what way did you make your retreat from the town of Savanna?</P>
<P>A. After being detained &s;ome time enquiring for my &s;ervant, I retreated over M'Gilvray's creek, &s;ome di&s;tance below the Spring-hill defile.</P>
<P>Q. Was it pa&s;&s;able for troops, or otherwi&s;e?</P>

<P>A. Not that I recollect.</P>
<P>Q. Why did you not retreat by the Spring-hill defile?</P>
<P>A. I made an attempt to go that way, but hearing a &s;mart fire, which appeared to be at that place, I was induced to belive the enemy had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and that I was too late.</P>
<P>Q. Did the country in the vicinity of Savanna abound with waggons and teams?</P>
<P>A. I believe not.</P>

<P>Q. When, and in what manner did the army retreat?</P>
<P>A. The South Carolina brigade in front, and part of the artillery in the centre, the Georgia brigade in the rear of the whole, except a field-piece commanded by Captain Defoe.</P>
<P>Q. Was there any confu&s;ion in the retreat, and to what was it owing?</P>
<P>A. There was, and it appeared to me that the confu&s;ion was occa&s;ioned by the enemy's cannon being di|rected at the column, and the firing of &s;mall arms on our left flank.</P>
<P>Q. Did the Georgia troops during the retreat &s;eparate from the column?</P>
<P>A. They did.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know by what cau&s;e, and by who&s;e orders?</P>

<P>A. Yes they were, and we were to retreat, if di&s;per&s;ed, to the road where the fork leads to M'Gilvray's hou&s;e, as well as I recollect.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="017772_0015_0FA2BC4EC1A04A50">Q. Was this rendezvous pointed out for the whole, or only part of the army?</P>

<P>Q. by the Court. Do you know the rea&s;on of the column's being changed from platoons to files, or did you hear General Elbert give any rea&s;on for that manoeuvre?</P>
<P>A. It appeared to me that the arrangement of the Georgia brigade was changed from the enemy's cannon being directed at the column, and a &s;hot &s;triking near the centre, and immediately an alteration took place, but I do not recollect of ever hearing General Elbert give it as a rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Q. by General Howe. What number of &s;hot were fired previous to the alteration?</P>
<P>A. Four or five.</P>
<P>Q. by the Court. Did you &s;ee General Howe with the Georgia brigade, after that change of di&s;po&s;ition was made?</P>

<P>The Court met agreeable to adjournment.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Edward Lloyd being &s;worn informs the Court, that on the 29th December, 1778, ju&s;t as the enemy were approaching, he was reque&s;ted by the Major of the regiment of militia to which he belonged to act as Serjeant-Major, and to get the men in order, but previous to that day he acted as a private, and that he knew nothing with re&s;pect to the general di&s;po&s;ition of the army. The Court are of opinion that the ca|pacity in which Lieutenant Lloyd acted on 29th December, would not admit of his knowing any matters re|&s;pecting the charges exhibited again&s;t General Howe, and therefore thought it unnece&s;&s;ary to a&s;k him any further que&s;tions on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Mordecai Shefftal &s;worn.</P>
<P>Q. Were you in the army in Georgia, at the time that the Briti&s;h troops under the command of Colonel Campbell invaded that State?</P>

<P>Q. Had you, on or about the 29th of December, made a return or report to General Howe of the quantity of provi&s;ions on hand?</P>
<P>A. On the 25th of December I reported to General Howe that I had a quantity of provi&s;ions on hand.</P>
<P>Q. Did you, on or previous to the 29th of December, receive any orders from General Howe to remove the&s;e provi&s;ions?</P>
<P>A. On the 25th I applied to General Howe, to know whether I &s;hould remove the provi&s;ions. He &s;aid he thought there was no danger. I told him, I thought there was. He then told me, if I thought proper, I might remove them. I then told him I could put &s;ome of them on board a ve&s;&s;el on freight. He then gave me an order for a Corporal and four privates, to impre&s;s Negroes to remove them from the &s;tore to the ve&s;&s;el. I &s;et about it, and removed 78 barrels of flour.</P>
<P>Q. What became of the flour you removed?</P>
<P>A. It &s;at off from the wharff to go up the river, but what became of it afterwards I know not.</P>
<P>Q. Did you &s;ee any general orders re&s;pecting the removal of provi&s;ions from Savanna, on or before the 29th of December?</P>
<P>A. I never &s;aw any.</P>
<P>Q. Had the provi&s;ions you have mentioned been removed &s;o as to be out of the reach of the enemy, and the landing of the enemy &s;o retarded as to require a longer &s;tay of the army near Savanna, had you any means in that ca&s;e to &s;upply the army?</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="017772_0016_0FA2BC4EF4154850">A. The Commi&s;&s;ary of Purcha&s;es &s;upplied me with fre&s;h provi&s;ions for the u&s;e of the army, and what quantity he had by him I cannot tell.</P>
<P>Q. Could teams and waggons be procured in a &s;hort time from the inhabitants, for the removal of the &s;tores to any i&s;land di&s;tant?</P>
<P>A. I do not think there could.</P>
<P>Q. Suppo&s;ing the &s;tores to have been removed by water, could they have been depo&s;ited in places inacce&s;|&s;ible to the ve&s;&s;els and boats of the enemy?</P>
<P>A. They could have been &s;ecured for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>Q. From what authority did you hold your appointment as Commi&s;&s;ary to the continental troops?</P>
<P>A. From General Elbert, then Colonel Commandant of the troops belonging to that State.</P>
<P>Q. When you applied to General Howe on the 25th of December, did you inform him that there was a &s;ufficient quantity of ve&s;&s;els for the removal of provi&s;ions?</P>

<P>A. I don't recollect that I was.</P>
<P>Q. Was the ve&s;&s;el you did obtain loaded?</P>
<P>A. No; becau&s;e &s;he could not have gone up the river if &s;he was loaded.</P>
<P>Q. by the Court. By who&s;e orders were the 240 barrels of flour (mentioned in your an&s;wer to General Howe's que&s;tion) removed?</P>

<P>Captain John Budd &s;worn.</P>
<P>Q. Were you in the army when Colonel Campbell invaded Georgia?</P>
<P>A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. In what capacity did you act?</P>
<P>A. As a Lieutenant in Colonel Roberts's regiment of artillery.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know what &s;teps were taken by General Howe to prevent the enemy landing?</P>
<P>A. As there is &s;uch a length of time elap&s;ed, I do not recollect any particular circum&s;tance relative to the di&s;po&s;itions of the army.</P>
<P>Q. What was your po&s;t in the column in the retreat?</P>
<P>A. Immediately in front of the Georgia brigade.</P>
<P>Q. What was your po&s;t in the line in the time of action?</P>
<P>A. On the right of the continentals.</P>
<P>Q. Do you recollect at what period of the retreat the Georgia brigade quitted the line of march?</P>
<P>A. I do not recollect at what particular period, but the fir&s;t I ob&s;erved of their being gone was when we wanted them to &s;upport the field-piece when we arrived on the hill, where one of our hor&s;es and driver were &s;hot, which was the means of our lo&s;ing the piece.</P>
<P>Q. How far were you advanced in front of the Georgia brigade when the army took up their line of march on the retreat?</P>
<P>A. About twenty or thirty paces.</P>
<P>Q. How far di&s;tant from the town was the hill you &s;peak of?</P>
<P>A. About half a mile to the northward.</P>
<P>Q. How far was the rear of the South-Carolina brigade advanced in your front at the time you halted?</P>
<P>A. There were three field-pieces and two ammunition-waggons between the infantry and the field-piece with which I was, and we were as clo&s;e as we could be to the ammunition-waggon when we halted, and the front of the artillery clo&s;e to the rear of the South-Carolina brigade.</P>
<P>Q. Was your piece particularly attached to the Georgia brigade?</P>
<P>A. I do not know that it was.</P>
<P>Q. Were there any more field-pieces, be&s;ide the one you mention, lo&s;t in the action of that day?</P>
<P>A. Not belonging to the continental troops.</P>
<P>Q. Did you fire your field-piece in the line, before the retreat commenced?</P>
<P>A. Yes; we did fire four or five times with round &s;hot, at the di&s;tance of 150 paces.</P>
<P>Q. Had you any grape or ca&s;e &s;hot?</P>
<P>A. We had a great quantity of grape, but no ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Q. by General Howe. Did you &s;ee me in the cour&s;e of the retreat, and where?</P>

<P>Mr. Co&s;hman Pollock &s;worn.</P>
<P>Q. Were you in the army in Georgia, at the time the Briti&s;h troops under Colonel Campbell invaded that State?</P>
<P>A. I was in the militia.</P>
<P>Q. In what capacity did you act?</P>
<P>A. As a private.</P>
<P>The Court were of the &s;ame opinion with re&s;pect to Mr. Pollock, as to Mr. Lloyd.</P>
<P>Major General Elbert &s;worn.</P>
<P>Q. Were you in the American army when Colonel Campbell invaded Georgia, and in what capacity?</P>
<P>A. I was, and in the capacity of Colonel Commandant of the Georgia brigade.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know how long previous to the inva&s;ion of Georgia General Howe received intelligence of the de&s;igns of the enemy, and what &s;teps were taken by him in con&s;equence?</P>
<P>A. I don't know that General Howe had any previous information of the de&s;igns of the enemy to invade the State of Georgia. Some time about the beginning of November 1778, being in Charles-Town on bu|&s;ine&s;s of the public, where General Howe then was, accounts were received that Colonel Provo&s;t, with a con&s;iderable force from Ea&s;t-Florida, had invaded that State. I immediately received the General's orders to return to Georgia, where, I think the &s;econd day after my arrival, I was joined by him, who informed me that he had ordered &s;ome continental troops from the State of South-Carolina to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and that &s;ome militia of that State were a&s;&s;embling for the like purpo&s;e; the latter, after being &s;ome days in Georgia, returned. Colonel Provo&s;t having retreated before their arrival, part of the continentals ordered from South-Carolina were brought into Georgia, and the remainder po&s;ted at Pury&s;burgh. Nearly about the time of Colonel Provo&s;t's inva&s;ion, a ve&s;&s;el arrived at Tybee, and after remaining a day or two &s;ailed again. From this ve&s;&s;el we had a de&s;erter, who informed that &s;he was a tran&s;port with Briti&s;h troops on board, and one of a con&s;iderable fleet that had &s;ailed from New-York to invade the State. Some time the latter end of December, a fleet appeared upon the coa&s;t, and a few days after arrived at Tybee; upon which General Howe drew all the troops of the State and tho&s;e of South-Carolina before-mentioned to Savanna, except a garri&s;on left in the &s;ort at Sunbury, and Colonel Marbury's regiment po&s;ted at Augu&s;ta. On the 28th De|cember, the enemy's fleet proceeded up the river Savanna, the van of which anchored nearly oppo&s;ite Girar|deau's, where, from &s;ome of their movements, it was judged they would attempt to land their troops. In the evening of that day I was at the above place with General Howe and &s;everal other officers, reconnoitering the enemy. The General, on leaving the place, reque&s;ted that I would remain and po&s;t a picquet he had ordered there, and de&s;ired that I would order the officer commanding the picquet to cau&s;e the dam leading from the river to the hill to be cut acro&s;s. When the picquet arrived, I po&s;ted them in the manner that I thought would be&s;t an&s;wer the purpo&s;e for which they were &s;ent, and gave the officer the orders I had in charge from the General. I then marked out the ground where I judged it nece&s;&s;ary to throw up &s;ome works, and told the officer I would go to the General and try to have his party, which con&s;i&s;ted of only thirty men, con&s;iderably reinforced, and at the &s;ame time obtain an order to have &s;ome entrenching tools &s;ent down. I waited upon the General, and informed him that I had every rea&s;on to believe that the enemy in|tended to land at Girardeau's, and recommended to him to have the picquet there con&s;iderably reinforced, and reque&s;ted that he would immediately order &s;ome entrenching tools to the place, as the party was entirely without. I am not certain, but I believe I recommended at the &s;ame time to the General to &s;end a field-piece or two to the &s;ame place. His reply was, that he would con&s;ider of it, and reque&s;ted that I would call on him in an hour or two. On my return to the General, at about ten or eleven o'clock at night, I un|der&s;tood him that the entrenching tools were &s;ent. With re&s;pect to the reinforcement, he told me that he could not &s;pare more than 20 men, which he reque&s;ted that I would go down with. I did &s;o, and on my ar|rival was &s;urprized to find that no tools were at the place. It being then too late to obtain them, &s;o as to be of any &s;ervice, I told Captain Smith, who commanded the picquet, that at day-light I did not doubt but he would &s;ee the enemy landed, and recommended that he would re&s;erve his fire until they got within 50 or 60 yards, then to commence a cool, deliberate fire, and retreat up until he was either &s;upported or forced from his ground. As I judged it happened, but the party were &s;oon forced from the hill, when the enemy gained footing a little after day-light, and were the mo&s;t of that day, the 29th, in full view, landing their troops and artillery, without the lea&s;t interruption from us.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know what force the enemy landed?</P>
<P>A. The force with which the enemy invaded the State amounted to full 3000 men. I believe they had about 2000 landed when they advanced towards us.</P>
<P>Q. What was the compo&s;ition and number of the army under General Howe?</P>
<P>A. Between 5 and 600 continental troops, and a detachment of artillery with four or five field-pieces, and about 100 militia.</P>
<P>Q. In what manner did the main body of the enemy approach, and what re&s;i&s;tance was made?</P>
<P>A. The enemy advanced in two columns, their right along a path leading through Sir James Wright's plantation, halting in full view of us at a place called Gay's, their left down the main road leading from Girardeau's to Savanna; while we were amu&s;ed by the fir&s;t column in front, the latter filed by their left, along a bye-path leading through the back of Milledge's old field, and acro&s;s a &s;wamp upon our right to an open pine barren at the back of the new barracks, where they were met by the militia under Colonel Wal|ton, who, after a &s;mart &s;kirmi&s;h, were forced from their ground. I know of no other re&s;i&s;tance, except by the picquet at Girardeau's, and the firing of a few field-pieces in the front of our line that was made to the enemy.</P>
<P>Q. When, and in what manner did the army retreat?</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="017772_0018_0FA2BC52C45E1A60">A. Between three and four o'clock in the afternoon of the 29th, the army was ordered to retire in the following order; the South-Carolina troops to retreat fir&s;t to the Spring-hill, and there form and cover the retreat of the artilletry and Georgia troops, the latter to form &s;omewhere about M'Gilvray's path, and there remain, until joined by the former. Our army was formed acro&s;s the road leading from Savanna to Girar|deau's, near half a mile below the town, under a hill of ea&s;y a&s;cent in an open field, with a ravine in front, Tatnall's buildings better than 100 yards on our right, and Governor Wright's barn about the &s;ame di&s;tance on our left, with a traver&s;e acro&s;s the road in our centre with two field-pieces, and a field-piece advanced in front of each wing; on our right was a &s;wamp, &s;ome di&s;tance up which, at the back of Tatnall's buildings, a path led from Milledge's to town; on this path a work was thrown up, in which was po&s;ted a detachment of continental &s;oldiers, and to the right of this, up the &s;ame &s;wamp, I under&s;tood the militia were to have been po&s;ted. Our left was in &s;ome degree covered by a battery at &s;ome di&s;tance wide of its rear, which com|manded part of a low rice-field not very acce&s;&s;ible. As &s;oon as the enemy, who were in our front, ob&s;erved the Carolina troops go off the field and our artillery limbered, they moved bri&s;kly forward, and commenced a &s;harp cannonade on the Georgia brigade, which was formed in a clo&s;e column by &s;ections by the left, with the left in front. As &s;oon as the artillery moved off the field, I faced the column to the right about, and re|tired in that order. As we cro&s;&s;ed the road, the enemy's artillery made &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion on the column, notwith&s;tanding which it pre&s;erved perfect good order. Ju&s;t as we gained the &s;ummit of the hill, a heavy fire of mu&s;quetry commenced towards our left, when I perceived our artillery go off on a full gallop. I moved as quick as I po&s;&s;ibly could without getting into di&s;order. About 100 yards before I got to the &s;outh|ea&s;t extremity of the town, a body of the enemy, advanced to the ea&s;t of the new barracks, commenced a heavy fire of mu&s;quetry on our left flank; at the &s;ame time ob&s;erving the Carolina brigade beyond the &s;outh|we&s;t extremity of the town, in &s;ome di&s;order, pu&s;hing for the Spring-hill, and a body of the enemy near that place keeping up a &s;mart fire on them, I judged it too late for me to attempt that defile, as the enemy mu&s;t be in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it before I could po&s;&s;ibly reach it. In this &s;ituation, with the enemy in front, flank and rear, I formed the de&s;ign of attempting to force my way up the Ogechee road, where I ob&s;erved the enemy's line to be the weake&s;t, and with this view ordered my light infantry to advance and attack the enemy on my flanks, to draw their fire while I reduced the column, and to divert their attention from my main de&s;ign. Immediately after the order to the light infantry, as we advanced, I ordered an open column, as &s;oon as I &s;aw that there was a proper di&s;tance between the &s;ections, which happened ju&s;t as we were be|hind the burying-ground. I lo&s;t no more time than was nece&s;&s;ary for the following words of command: Halt: Sections, to the left face: By files to the right wheel: March. Before I got the rear well clear of the burying-ground, the line broke about the centre, and the whole, except three or four &s;ections, fell up one of the &s;treets. Ob&s;erving the few that followed me, I led them through where a &s;quare of buildings had but late been burnt down, and halted before the Court-hou&s;e door, which being a brick building, I had thought of throwing my&s;elf into it, but previous to taking this &s;tep, I determined to con&s;ult Colonel Harris, the next officer in command to my&s;elf. I called him to me, and a&s;ked if he could recommend any place through which I could effect a retreat? he an&s;wered that we might get over Mu&s;grove's creek. I ob&s;erved to him that it was a full tide, and that the creek could not be pa&s;&s;able. He replied that there was a log, which he had been fifty times over. I replied, lead me to it, it is a happy circum&s;tance, we will &s;ave our men; and called out, Follow me, &s;oldiers, and I will conduct you to a &s;afe retreat. I heard the words, Follow the com|mandant, frequently repeated; and le&s;t they might not know what I intended, I kept waving my &s;word over my head, and moved &s;lowly on at the head of the few that yet pre&s;erved their order, and &s;ent Colonel Harris back to the rear with orders to pu&s;h them on, and de&s;ired that he would join me in time before I got to the creek. This he did, but when we got there he could not find the log, owing I &s;uppo&s;e to the high tide. As the only alternative, I then ordered the &s;oldiers to &s;wim the creek; a few obeyed my command, others alledged that they could not &s;wim. The enemy, who had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Spring-hill defile, moved down and kept a &s;mart fire on us, and, rather than be taken pri&s;oner, I &s;aved my&s;elf by &s;wimming, as did Colonel Harris. Major Grimkie, one of the General's Aids, &s;wam a little above where I did.</P>
<P>Q. What was the lo&s;s in men, cannon and &s;tores, and by what means were they lo&s;t?</P>
<P>A. The manner in which the Georgia troops were lo&s;t I have already an&s;wered; re&s;pecting tho&s;e of South-Carolina I can't &s;ay. I believe the number of continental troops lo&s;t that day exceeded 200. One field-piece was taken from the militia, another from the continental artillery, owing, as I was informed, to the driver being killed. Five other long bra&s;s field-pieces not properly mounted, that were removed out of town, with a quantity of ammunition, in con&s;equence of our misfortune fell into the enemy's hands. Several iron pieces, with a quantity of &s;tores that it was impo&s;&s;ible to move after the enemy made their appearance, were likewi&s;e lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Q. When did the army cro&s;s Savanna river, and in what manner?</P>
<P>A. I don't know.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know of any orders given to the troops at Augu&s;ta and Sunbury to leave the State?</P>
<P>A. The General informed me of the orders he had &s;ent to the garri&s;on of Sunbury. I don't recollect what they exactly were, but they were &s;uch as I approved of at the time, and only lament they were not obeyed. With re&s;pect to the orders given to the troops at Augu&s;ta I can't &s;ay.</P>
<P>Q. What was the number of militia belonging to the State of Georgia?</P>
<P>A. I believe the whole militia of the State of Georgia amounted to about 3000 men.</P>
<P>Q. When the inva&s;ion of Georgia took place, what proportion of militia was reque&s;ted by General Howe of the executive authority?</P>
<P>A. About the time of the inva&s;ion General Howe was frequently with the Governor, and at that time I am certain the General informed me of every material matter that pa&s;&s;ed between them; but at this time I don't recollect any particulars of con&s;equence, tho' to the be&s;t of my belief he repre&s;ented to the Governor, that as many militia as could be collected would be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know the numbers actually in the field at that time?</P>
<P>A. No.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="017772_0019_0FA2BC5402C048E0">Q. Do you know of any previous di&s;po&s;itions made by General Howe, in ca&s;e of a retreat?</P>
<P>A. The general orders before-mentioned, that were i&s;&s;ued re&s;pecting the mode of retreating, if nece&s;&s;ary, may be deemed a previous di&s;po&s;ition. I know of no other.</P>
<P>Q. Were the militia of the State of Georgia in general armed, and in what manner?</P>
<P>A. The militia of the State of Georgia were in general but indifferently armed. Tho&s;e belonging to the town of Savanna I judged to be very well armed.</P>
<P>Q. What is the general face of the country in the vicinity of Savanna?</P>
<P>A. The town of Savanna &s;tands on a high &s;andy ridge, which terminates in a bluff near a mile in extent on the river. This ridge runs backward, upwards of two miles, nearly the &s;ame width, and is a remarkable level open pine-barren. On each &s;ide of the ridge a creek empties into the river, which occa&s;ions two &s;wamps, both of which, rather farther back than the tows, are cultivated, the uncultivated parts are very thickly wooded; that to the &s;outh-ea&s;t of the town is pa&s;&s;able in many places; the other, to the &s;outh-we&s;t of the town, is &s;carcely pa&s;&s;able but where the road runs through it. On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the &s;wamp, below the town, is Girardeau's place, a bluff 40 or 50 feet high, and ridge nearly &s;imilar to that on which the town &s;tands, with this difference, that the ridge terminates nearly three quarters of a mile from the river, and leaves a remarkably level &s;wamp, overflowed by every &s;pring-tide.</P>
<P>Q. Were the army in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a proportion of entrenching tools to erect works?</P>
<P>A. I don't believe that the army had a proper &s;upply of entrenching tools, but I am certain that a &s;uffi|cient quantity could have been obtained to throw up works that would have been of &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Q. What were the applications made at different times by General Howe to the legi&s;lative and executive authority of the State for means of defending it?</P>
<P>A. With re&s;pect to any further applications I don't recollect.</P>
<P>Q. by the Court. Do you know what rea&s;ons operated to prevent the enemy's being oppo&s;ed in landing their troops?</P>
<P>A. No.</P>
<P>Q. Had the enemy any ve&s;&s;els of force to cover the landing of their troops?</P>
<P>A. Yes, and from the di&s;po&s;itions of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, I judged they intended landing at that place.</P>
<P>Q. by General Howe. Were or were not the legi&s;lative and executive bodies of the State of Georgia, at different times, frequently applied to by me, both per&s;onally and by letter, to fortify the country at particu|lar places, be&s;ide other mea&s;ures &s;trongly recommended by me for the general defence of the State?</P>
<P>A. Yes, I believe they were.</P>
<P>Q. Did you ever &s;ee any letters of mine to that State for that purpo&s;e?</P>
<P>A. Some con&s;iderable time before the inva&s;ion, I recollect &s;eeing a letter from you, very fully on that &s;ub|ject, laid before the A&s;&s;embly, which gave offence; in con&s;equence, as I apprehended, of your attempting to dictate to them.</P>
<P>Colonel Marbury &s;worn.</P>
<P>Q. Were you in the army in Georgia, when the enemy under Colonel Campbell invaded that State?</P>
<P>A. I was.</P>
<P>Q. In what capacity did you act?</P>
<P>A. I had the command of a regiment, but it was not pre&s;ent. The day previous to the 29th of Decem|ber I arrived at Savanna, and acted as Aid to General Howe on the latter part of the day the enemy landed.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know how long previous to the inva&s;ion of Georgia General Howe received intelligence of the de&s;igns of the enemy, and what &s;teps were taken by him in con&s;equence?</P>
<P>A. I do not know when General Howe received the intelligence, and as I was out of town, do not know what &s;teps were taken previous to the evening of the 28th December, 1778, when I joined the General about &s;un-&s;et at Girardeau's. He was then, in company with &s;everal gentlemen of the army, reconnoitering the ground, and &s;poke of it's being very defen&s;ible.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know what force the enemy landed?</P>
<P>A. It was generally &s;aid, and I believe they landed at lea&s;t 2000 men.</P>
<P>Q. What was the compo&s;ition and number of the army under General Howe?</P>
<P>A. About 500 continentals, with a detachment of Colonel Roberts's artillery, four or five field pieces, and about 100 militia.</P>
<P>Q. In what manner did the main body of the enemy approach, and what re&s;i&s;tance was made?</P>
<P>A. They advanced in two columns, one by the path leading thro' Sir James Wright's plantations, the other on the main road leading to Savanna. They appeared in full view at Gay's gate, from a little below which place a detachment filed off, and thro' a thick &s;wamp gained our right and charged Colonel Walton, who, with about 80 militia and a field-piece, was po&s;ted back of the new barracks, and from the enemy's great &s;uperiority of numbers was obliged to leave the ground, and retreat precipitately after a &s;hort engage|ment. I don't know of any other re&s;i&s;tance made, except a few &s;hot from the artillery in front of our army, before a retreat was made, and a fire from Captain Smith, who commanded the party at Girardeau's, on the enemy, as they advanced to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Girardeau's hill.</P>
<P>Q. When, and in what manner did the army retreat?</P>
<P>A. I was not on the ground when the retreat was ordered; but I think about or a little after three o'clock, as I was going with a requi&s;ition from Colonel Walton to the General for troops to &s;upport him, I met Ge|neral Howe, at the head of the Carolineans, retreating, about half way between Tatnall's and the town. They were then in good order.</P>
<P>Q. What was the lo&s;s in men, cannon and &s;tores, and by what means were they lo&s;t?</P>
<P>A. I do not know the lo&s;s of either, nor can I account by what means.</P>
<P>Q. When did the army cro&s;s Savanna river, and in what manner?</P>
<P>A. On the night of the 30th General Howe reached Treutlan's, which is about 45 miles above Savanna, and &s;ent out to &s;ecure the boats, and began to cro&s;s the baggage on the morning following at the Two Si&s;ters.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="017772_0020_0FA2BC550A5629F8">Q. Do you know of any orders given to the troops at Augu&s;ta and Sunbury to leave the State?</P>
<P>A. After we had retreated to Cherokee hill, about eight miles from Savanna, the General &s;ent Captain Wood with orders to the officer commanding the troops at Sunbury to evacuate the fort, to retreat and join the General. On the next day, or day after, Major Dehey&s;er was &s;ent to Augu&s;ta, with orders for the troops &s;tationed there to cro&s;s the river, and join the continental army wherever they might be.</P>
<P>Q. What were the number of militia belonging to the State of Georgia?</P>
<P>A. I think there was about two thou&s;and five hundred men.</P>
<P>Q. When the inva&s;ion of Georgia took place, what proportion of militia was reque&s;ted by General Howe of the executive authority?</P>
<P>A. I do not know.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know the number actually in the field at that time?</P>
<P>A. I don't know.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know of any previous di&s;po&s;itions made by General Howe, in ca&s;e of a retreat?</P>
<P>A. I do not.</P>
<P>Q. How far is Milledge's pa&s;s from the po&s;t then occupied by the main body of General Howe's army?</P>
<P>A. I think it is about half a mile.</P>
<P>Q. Were the militia of Georgia in general armed, and in what manner?</P>
<P>A. They were badly armed.</P>
<P>Q. What is the general face of the country in the vicinity of Savanna?</P>
<P>A. I am not well enough acquainted with the place to de&s;cribe it.</P>
<P>Q. Were the army in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a proportion of entrenching tools to erect works?</P>
<P>A. I do not know.</P>
<P>Q. What were the applications made at different times by General Howe to the legi&s;lative and executive authority of the State for means of defending it?</P>
<P>A. I have heard mention made of frequent applications, but cannot attempt to &s;ay what they were.</P>
<P>Q. by General Howe. What were the orders given you by me on that day, and other circum&s;tances that pa&s;&s;ed between us?</P>
<P>A. On the evening of the 28th December 1778, after returning from Girardeau's with General Howe, he reque&s;ted that I would collect three or four gentlemen, and patrole the country that night between the &s;ea and Savanna, to ob&s;erve if any of the enemy had landed below, or if any of the country people appear|ed to be going to the Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els. I did &s;o, and returned ju&s;t about day-break, and &s;oon after a firing commenced by Captain Smith at Girardeau's, who was &s;oon forced from his po&s;t, and it occupied by the Briti&s;h. A little after I returned to town, and about twelve o'clock rode to head-quarters at Tatnall's hou&s;e, in company with Colonel Huger and General Elbert. They informed me that the General had called a council, wherein it was determined to remain on the ground where they were and receive the enemy. Tho&s;e gentlemen informed General Howe that they had ju&s;t returned from reconnoitering the ground on our right, that the &s;wamp was pa&s;&s;able, and they did not like their &s;ituation. The General &s;aid he was not well plea&s;ed with it, or words to that purpo&s;e, and reque&s;ted tho&s;e gentlemen to take the opinions of the officers who had compo&s;ed the council. Some little time after this, the General reque&s;ted me to take a view of the ground, and immediately return to him; I did &s;o, and gave information &s;imilar to what he had before received. I a&s;ked the General if he thought it would be ami&s;s to &s;end a company to the place where it was thought the enemy would cro&s;s the &s;wamp, about a quarter of a mile higher up, where there was a &s;mall brea&s;t-work, occupied by Captain Keith of South-Carolina, with a company of regular troops, I think about 30 or 40. He &s;aid it was a lucky thought, and reque&s;ted me to take the command. Having no other at that time, my regiment being in Augu&s;ta, I accepted it chearfully. The General de&s;ired me to ride up and look out a convenient place, and he would order up the men. He &s;ent Major Grimkie, his Aid, directly after me, who informed me that the militia under Colonel Walton were to occupy the ground I &s;poke of, and that he &s;hould not &s;end up any regulars. I then returned to the General, told him that I did not wi&s;h to remain as an idle &s;pectator, and would be glad he would employ me. He told me to remain with him, and if the enemy advanced I might be of &s;ervice. A little after the enemy appeared in view, and the General reque&s;ted me to go up and remain on the right between, and have an eye on the brea&s;t-work and the militia. I went up, and about three o'clock (I think) the enemy appeared, and &s;hortly after formed on an eminence that the militia had left a little before, and which Colonel Walton attempted to regain, but was too late. The mili|tia appeared in confu&s;ion, and could not be reduced to order. A field-piece was fired once or twice in front of the militia, and though the Colonel prevailed on them to advance and gave them three cheers, they were &s;till in confu&s;ion. I a&s;ked him if it would not be nece&s;&s;ary to get a &s;upport of regulars. He reque&s;ted me to ride to General Howe, to inform him of his &s;ituation, that he would maintain the ground as long as po&s;&s;ible, but was afraid he could not do it long without &s;upport, and reque&s;ted the General to &s;end a detach|ment to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. On my way to head-quarters I pa&s;&s;ed near to the &s;mall work occupied by Captain Keith, who called and informed me that General Howe had retreated, and a&s;ked what he had be&s;t do. I pointed out his route, and advi&s;ed him to make the be&s;t of his way, and then came up to General Howe, about half way between Tatnall's and town, at the head of the Carolina troops, who were in good order. I let him know Colonel Walton's reque&s;t. He ordered me back to him immediately with orders to retreat; but when I returned behind the barracks, I found the Briti&s;h on the ground, and the militia flying towards the Spring-hill, about 200 yards before me. I did not &s;ee Colonel Walton again, and never got up with the whole of the militia till they had got over the defile that we had to pa&s;s. There in vain I endeavoured to rally them, and on my return met General Howe about the Spring-hill (the troops were then in great confu&s;ion) who immediately reque&s;ted me to try again to rally the militia, and was the &s;econd time as un&s;uc|ce&s;sful as the fir&s;t. By the time I returned, the artillery and troops had reached the Red-Hou&s;e, called M'Gilvray's, near the upper end of the defile, where they halted; and after a &s;hort time the General &s;ent me to Colonel White, who had command of the galleys and other ve&s;&s;els laying above Race-Hall, to inform him of our retreat and to order him to move up the river with the ve&s;&s;els, and when at any advantageous
<PB N="22" REF="017772_0021_0FA2BC55BA9D8610" MS="y">
place to come to, in order to prevent any ve&s;&s;els running up the river and landing men to cut off our retreat; but at the &s;ame time not to remain in any place &s;o long, as to endanger the ve&s;&s;els under his command.</P>
<P>Q. Where was the militia po&s;ted when you fir&s;t &s;aw them after you were &s;ent to the right?</P>
<P>A. On a &s;mall eminence near a branch, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the barracks.</P>
<P>Q. Where were they when you went to them the &s;econd time?</P>
<P>A. Between that eminence and the barracks.</P>
<P>Q. Was it a part of the Carolina brigade you &s;aw when you returned from endeavouring to rally the militia, or the main body?</P>
<P>A. Only a part.</P>
<P>Q. What time were you with me before I &s;ent you to the gallies?</P>
<P>A. I do not believe it was more than a quarter of an hour.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Colonel Ternant was &s;worn.</P>
<P>Q. Were you in the army at the inva&s;ion of Georgia by Colonel Campbell?</P>
<P>A. I was.</P>
<P>Q. In what capacity did you then act?</P>
<P>A. As In&s;pector to the army.</P>
<P>Q. At the commencement of the inva&s;ion, what &s;teps were taken by Major General Howe to prevent the enemy landing?</P>
<P>A. From the 24th of December, when the Briti&s;h fleet fir&s;t entered the Savanna river, to the 29th, when the action took place, the General, with Governor Hou&s;ton and &s;everal officers of the army, vi&s;ited the &s;e|veral places where it was mo&s;t probable the enemy would land. I was pre&s;ent at tho&s;e reconnoitering excur|&s;ions. The landing at Girardeau's was generally looked upon as the mo&s;t likely to be cho&s;en by the enemy, which occa&s;ioned di&s;cu&s;&s;ion about the means mo&s;t effectual to prevent them, and in general to counteract their operations. It was generally thought nece&s;&s;ary, and as I under&s;tood agreed on between the Governor and General, to erect a battery on the banks of the river, &s;o as to prevent the approach of the &s;hipping to the cau&s;eway, and con&s;equently the enemy's landing and taking po&s;t on the bluff. The fort on Savanna was al&s;o to be repaired and enclo&s;ed. The high banks rai&s;ed along the river, from Savanna-bluff to Girardeau's cau&s;eway, for the purpo&s;e of watering and draining the rice-fields, were to be broken &s;o as to overflow tho&s;e fields at high water, and render the whole extent of them, from Girardeau's cau&s;eway to the cau&s;eway in front of the troops on Fair-Lawn, as impa&s;&s;able as po&s;&s;ible, and the&s;e fields without that prevention were then thought pa&s;&s;able for infantry by files, tho' not without difficulty. Some other field works were likewi&s;e to be made in the vicinity of the place, extended as a po&s;ition for the troops, which then might amount to about 650 regulars and about 100 militia. The means nece&s;&s;ary to make the&s;e field preparations being en|tirely in the hands of the executive of Georgia, &s;uch as Negroes, tools of all kinds, hor&s;es and gears for the tran&s;portation of artillery, applications were made by the General to procure them. They were promi&s;ed &s;everal times in my pre&s;ence by Governor Hou&s;ton, but never furni&s;hed, any further than by &s;ending three Negroes the 26th in the morning with two tools, and the&s;e went away in the evening of the &s;ame day and ne|ver appeared again. I heard the General many times expre&s;s his complaints about it, and repeatedly &s;ent his Aids, but to no purpo&s;e. The chief command was even di&s;puted him, which occa&s;ioned confu&s;ion and de|lay in every mea&s;ure; and how &s;oon the di&s;pute ended by the Governor giving up the command to the Ge|neral I can't tell. On the 28th, fix of the enemy's ve&s;&s;els having come up and anchored oppo&s;ite to Girar|deau's bluff, the erecting of any battery on the banks of the river became impracticable; upon which a picquet of 50 men was po&s;ted at the hou&s;e on the bluff, with an intention, as I heard the General expre&s;s, to watch the motions of the enemy at that place, and oppo&s;e them &s;o far as to be reinforced in time, whenever it &s;hould be a&s;certained that they really intended to land there. On the 29th, early in the morning, a firing was heard at that place, in con&s;equence of the enemy's landing; upon which the General ordered me there, but before I reached half way, I found that and another picquet retreating. I had collected the whole toge|ther, when the General joined us, and ordered me to take command of them, and remain on the &s;pot where we were till further orders. I omitted to ob&s;erve that a mounted militia man was left with the commanding officer of the picquet, to give the earlie&s;t intelligence of the enemy's apparent movements, but who never to my knowledge reported to the General, tho' he was &s;ent in time for that purpo&s;e, as I heard the commanding officer of the picquet &s;ay.</P>
<P>Q. At what di&s;tance from the main body of the army was the place the enemy landed?</P>
<P>A. Between a mile and a mile and an half.</P>
<P>Q. What force did they land at that time?</P>
<P>A. I under&s;tood, after the action, they landed upwards of 2000 men at that place.</P>
<P>Q. How many probable places of landing were there in the vicinity of the town?</P>
<P>A. There were &s;everal places above and below the town, who&s;e names have partly e&s;caped my memory, but which rendered every po&s;ition that could be taken with an inferior force in the vicinity of the town, for the purpo&s;e of defending it, exceedingly precarious.</P>
<P>Q. Were any &s;teps taken to watch the motions of the enemy at tho&s;e places?</P>
<P>A. Parties of militia were po&s;ted at each of tho&s;e places below the town, and a picquet of 50 continental troops at Girardeau's, as the mo&s;t probable place of landing. The two gallies were &s;o po&s;ted as to watch any movement the enemy could make by the back river, for the purpo&s;e of landing above the town.</P>
<P>Q. Did the enemy land at any other place than Girardeau's bluff?</P>
<P>A. Not that I know of.</P>
<P>Q. After it was known that the enemy landed, what mea&s;ures were taken to a&s;certain their numbers and to oppo&s;e them?</P>
<P>A. I cannot &s;peak to the fir&s;t part of that que&s;tion, further than that I heard the General &s;everal times complain he could get no information to be depended on, either about their force or de&s;igns. About three hours after the enemy had landed, I received orders to return to the army with the advanced picquets, who

immediately joined their re&s;pective corps. Two hours before the action a council of war was called of the field officers of the army, and from the uncertainty of the information procured by the General of the num|ber and de&s;ign of the enemy, and to gain as much time as po&s;&s;ible for the removal of public and private property from the town, it was unanimou&s;ly agreed that the army ought to remain on the &s;pot where they were then po&s;ted at Fair-Lawn until the views of the enemy could be known, and their &s;uperiority &s;o a&s;cer|tained as to urge and ju&s;tify a retreat. In con&s;equence of that determination, the following di&s;po&s;ition was made and i&s;&s;ued in general orders:</P>

<P>THE Carolina troops are to be told off into 16 platoons of eight files each, with the remaining files formed on their right as light infantry; the whole to be commanded by Colonel Huger. The Georgia troops to be formed into eight platoons of ten files each, with the remaining files on their left as light infantry; the whole to be commanded by General Elbert. The officers to take po&s;t as u&s;ual by &s;eniority in their re&s;pective lines. Tho&s;e who do not command platoons to fall in the rear of them as bringers-up, the better to pre|&s;erve order and regularity through the line. Both corps to be formed in columns; tho&s;e of Carolina by platoons on their right, and the others likewi&s;e by platoons on their left, and to remain in that formation, with the light infantry at the head of each column, until further orders. The artillery to remain in its pre|&s;ent po&s;ition, and to be in the utmo&s;t readine&s;s to move or act as occa&s;ion may require. The General reque&s;ts and expects that both officers and men will di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by their firmne&s;s and per&s;everance, and by an exact ob&s;ervance of orders. Should they be compelled to retreat, it is to be in the following order. The troops will move off in columns in the order &s;et forth. The light infantry of Carolina to form the advance guard, to march rapidly by the &s;horte&s;t route to the Spring-hill defile, which they will po&s;&s;e&s;s on both &s;ides and endeavour to maintain. The artillery, all but one field-piece, will follow the Carolina brigade, and Colonel Roberts, when he arrives at the defile, will po&s;t his pieces &s;o as be&s;t to cover the retreat of the Georgia brigade; Colonel Huger, his men &s;o as mo&s;t effectually to an&s;wer the &s;ame purpo&s;e, and to &s;ecure the artillery. The Georgia troops will follow their light infantry with a field-piece, forming the rear of the line, and as &s;oon as they reach the defile this colomn, with the whole of the artillery, will pa&s;s and form on the other &s;ide of it, in &s;uch manner as the commanding officer &s;hall think be&s;t to prevent in&s;ults from the enemy, and to &s;ecure the retreat of the troops from the head of the defile. Should a root take place, the troops are to re-a&s;&s;emble beyond the defile at M'Gilvray's road. Further orders are to be applied for, or will be given, as circum&s;tances &s;hall require.</P>

<P>I was then &s;ent again to reconnoitre the pa&s;&s;es through the &s;wamp on our right, and was accompanied by two militia-men who&s;e names I do not recollect. The principal gap was defended by a &s;trong picquet, who&s;e numbers I have forgot, and a redan which occupied the whole &s;pace of the pa&s;&s;age. The other pa&s;s was that mentioned to exi&s;t about a quarter of a mile further; I immediately went to vi&s;it it; we attempted three times to go through the &s;wamp at that place, and upon my guides pronouncing it impracticable we re|turned to the troops on Fair-Lawn. The General then ordered me to join a body of militia intended as a further &s;ecurity to his right flank, and to po&s;t them in &s;uch a manner as be&s;t to an&s;wer that object. I found them drawn up in one rank to the number of ninety-three, with a field-piece, nearly oppo&s;ite to the pa&s;s la&s;t mentioned. They being a too great di&s;tance from the &s;wamp, it was thought be&s;t to advance them clo&s;er to it; but before the nece&s;&s;ary movements could be performed with that irregular body, the enemy's light in|fantry came out of the &s;wamp, filing off to the right and left, &s;o as to come on the flanks of the militia, who from that moment would not be prevailed on to make the &s;malle&s;t alteration in their actual po&s;ition. As &s;oon as I &s;aw the enemy from the &s;wamp, I ordered a mounted militia-man to go and acquaint the Gene|ral with it. Mean while the field-piece was directed to fire on the thicke&s;t of the enemy, and the militia encouraged to keep their ground, until the enemy by approaching higher would be fired upon and &s;kirmi&s;hed with, &s;o as to cover as far as in their power the retreat of the troops on Fair-Lawn. As &s;oon as the enemy, who had performed this angular evolution out of the reach of mu&s;quetry, had arrived to both wings of the militia, they marched bri&s;kly, or rather ru&s;hed with great &s;houts. The militia, probably &s;truck with the &s;uperiority of the enemy, who amounted to about 700 men, broke without firing, and fled towards the Spring-hill cau&s;eway; a few only fired their mu&s;quets in retiring. Upon this the enemy poured in a heavy fire, and as &s;oon as the field-piece was &s;piked up I attempted to join the continental troops, whom I met about a hundred yards to the we&s;tward of the barracks, retreating in tolerable good order, except tho&s;e of Georgia under General Elbert, who, contrary to the di&s;po&s;ition, had quitted the line of march and gone into the town. I marched with the troops to the defile. Two hou&s;es that &s;tood on each &s;ide of it were occu|pied for a few minutes, and when all hopes of the Georgia troops arriving were over, and the enemy pre&s;&s;ing upon us, the troops with the artillery, except one field-piece, got over the cau&s;eway, and made a halt of a few minutes on the other &s;ide of it.</P>
<P>Q. by General Howe. Were the reports of the inva&s;ion given by the de&s;erter, &s;aid to come from the tran&s;port, previous to the retreat of the troops that invaded Georgia from St. Augu&s;tine, or afterwards?</P>
<P>A. They reached us at Sunbury, after the retreat of tho&s;e troops to Frederica.</P>
<P>Q. Had you any conver&s;ation with Colonel Walton at the po&s;t on our right, or any where on our right, in the cour&s;e of that day?</P>
<P>A. I had not.</P>
<P>Q. Where did you join me on the retreat?</P>
<P>A. At the place where I met the troops.</P>
<P>Q. Did I remain at the Spring-hill defile with General Huger till the troops had pa&s;&s;ed it?</P>

<P>The Court met agreeable to adjournment.</P>
<P>Major General Howe proceeds in his defence as follows:</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Pre&s;ident, and Gentlemen of the Court,</HI></P>
<P>CONSCIOUS as I am that I have to the utmo&s;t of my abilities endeavoured to &s;erve my country&mdash;that from principle I entered into the pre&s;ent conte&s;t with the earlie&s;t, re&s;olved not to retire but with the late&s;t, or at lea&s;t not until my life or American grievances had a period&mdash;that my zeal in the common cau&s;e was equal to any, and that my ardor to promote it could be exceeded by none&mdash;I little dreamed that I &s;hould at this day, or indeed on any other, have &s;tood arraigned at a military tribunal for imputed crimes, which malice would &s;trive to magnify and fix upon me, and by which my reputation might, for a time at lea&s;t, be held in &s;u&s;pence, even by the good. How painfully this mu&s;t affect me, let military &s;en&s;ibility determine: For in a profe&s;&s;ion &s;o cha&s;te as that of arms, where honor is &s;o feelingly alive that it mu&s;t &s;mart and agonize at the lea&s;t &s;hadow of a&s;per&s;ion, expre&s;&s;ion can give no proper colourings to my anxieties; indeed it yields me none, but what, compared to my feelings, would be poor and contemptible. Happily for me, however, I am ar|raigned before a Court where Ju&s;tice, with its delicate auxiliary Honor, &s;it as Judges; a Court where, of all others, had I been guilty, I &s;hould be mo&s;t appalled at appearing, but by which, con&s;cious of my innocence, I mo&s;t rejoice to be tried. Tho' it would not perhaps be very difficult to &s;hew that Georgia, as a State, had very little to do in this pro&s;ecution, yet, de&s;irous to be ju&s;tified by facts alone, and fearing no &s;earch, or re|&s;earch, tho' malevolence directs the probe, I &s;hall admit, for the pre&s;ent at lea&s;t, that having been mi&s;un|der&s;tood by or mi&s;repre&s;ented to the State of Georgia, they have thought proper to bring me where now you &s;ee me. The charges again&s;t me are heavy&mdash;let us &s;ee how they have been &s;upported; and though Colonel Walton is not the fir&s;t, yet, as he is the arch evidence upon this occa&s;ion, I &s;hall begin with him, and the more e&s;pecially, as he &s;o very comprehen&s;ively in his te&s;timony alludes to every charge brought again&s;t me, that remarking upon his evidence will, in a great mea&s;ure, do away the nece&s;&s;ity of de&s;canting upon the re&s;t. He tells you that the Briti&s;h troops from Ea&s;t Florida penetrated Georgia two ways; that they evidently ex|pected co-operating troops from the northward, which not arriving, they returned. That troops did enter the State in the manner he &s;ays is true; but by what &s;pirit of divination it was made evident to him that they expected co-operation, and retired for the want of it, I am at a lo&s;s to determine. If circum&s;tances at that time made it evident, tho&s;e circum&s;tances &s;hould have been declared; or if &s;ub&s;equent events evinced it, every principle of common ju&s;tice, could they have influence upon the Colonel, ought to have impelled him to relate them, that no undue deductions might be drawn from what he &s;aid in injury to a man by his means on trial for his reputation. It is not however from this in&s;tance alone that I am warranted to &s;ay that he is &s;eldom explicit, but where he thinks what he &s;ays will condemn me; end throws in &s;o dubious light every thing of a contrary tendency, that he appears to hope unfavourable inferences may be drawn from it. Cer|tain it is, that until the arrival of the de&s;erter he &s;peaks of, which was after the Ea&s;t Florida troops had re|treated, the ultimate end of their views appeared and was believed to be no more than an intention to ravage and lay wa&s;te as much of the State of Georgia as they could, to plunder the inhabitants and drive off the &s;tock,&mdash;the latter of much more importance to St. Augu&s;tine than people, unacquainted with its &s;ituation and the precariou&s;ne&s;s of its &s;upplies, would be apt to imagine. I confe&s;s that after-events demon&s;trated plainly that co-operation was then expected, but as nothing previous exi&s;ted to induce the idea, the Colonel &s;hould have expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner as to have left no po&s;&s;ibility of implication that there did; and this I doubt not he would have done, had ju&s;tice been all that he aimed at. I however &s;et at defiance the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of his malice, either within the&s;e walls or without them. He tells you further, that this account given by the man of the tran&s;port was &s;o much credited, that Doctor Hall and him&s;elf were &s;ent by the Governor and Council to Charle&s;town to commune with General Lincoln (then either arrived or expect|ed) upon the general &s;ituation of the State, and to give him the intelligence brought by the de&s;erter; that I was in South-Carolina when the&s;e advices were tran&s;mitted, and he takes it for granted I had them as early as others, but when or by whom he knows not, or what mea&s;ures were taken in con&s;equence; that the time I arrived at Savanna he cannot preci&s;ely a&s;certain, but that it appeared I was not expected, as the Delegates lately arrived from Congre&s;s had reported I was recalled from the department, and General Lincoln was or|dered on to &s;upercede me. Come, however, he &s;ays I did, rea&s;&s;umed the command, gave a&s;&s;urances that I would defend the town, and that there was little danger. What the Colonel means by the greate&s;t part of this I am at a lo&s;s to determine. I think I may be pretty certain that he does not mean to &s;erve me by it, and yet I cannot &s;ee how it can operate to injure me. It appears, in &s;hort, altogether in&s;ignificant as to any relative tendency until the latter end of it, when the cloven foot appears in the in&s;inuation that I gave im|proper encouragement to the inhabitants to &s;tay in town, that I was not expected, and that the command was a&s;&s;umed; that is, I &s;uppo&s;e, though he does not &s;peak out, that having been recalled I had no bu&s;ine&s;s there. If this be his meaning, I am amazed that a &s;enior Colonel of a State and Commandant of militia had not, in the cour&s;e of &s;ervice, or by the dictates of common &s;en&s;e, been taught, that though another General had been appointed to the department. I could not with military propriety leave it until his arrival, and that therefore I could not rea&s;&s;ume what had not been laid a&s;ide. I am authorized to &s;ay that in a part of this &s;tuff, intended by the Colonel for te&s;timony, he has ab&s;olutely deviated from facts. I had, upon the fir&s;t information of General Provo&s;t's incur&s;ion into Georgia, po&s;ted to that State, and took the command of the troops on the &s;outh &s;ide of Ogechee, where the Colonel was, and remained in Georgia till after the 29th of December. This he could not but remember, and upon cro&s;s-examination has confe&s;&s;ed, any more than I can forget that he left me and took off his party in that advanced &s;ituation, though I was very weak in numbers, while the enemy were &s;till in the State, and by all accounts no further off than between Newport river and the Altamaha. The Colonel amu&s;es the Court with an account of the reconnoitering parties we
<PB N="25" REF="017772_0024_0FA2BC59FB92EE48" MS="y">
were upon, in one of which he ob&s;erved a large wood which was to have been cut down, but he &s;ays it was never done, and in his manner of expre&s;&s;ing it &s;eems to imply &s;ome neglect in me. Had the cutting down of this wood been nece&s;&s;ary, which was far from being the ca&s;e, Mr. Walton cannot but know of the repeated applications made by me to his Governor for tools, hands and many other matters, for purpo&s;es of much greater con&s;equence, and that no a&s;&s;i&s;tance was yielded me; how then this wood was to have been cut down, or how he could expect it to be done, I cannot imagine, unle&s;s he had lately been reading Ta&s;&s;o, and, as he has talents for romance, might think that, like one of Ta&s;&s;o's heroes, I could fell fore&s;ts with one &s;troke of my <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> In the Colonel's account of matters, relative to the operations of the 29th, he &s;trives to criminate me in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> things, which, had I been guilty of them, would have at wor&s;t amounted to nothing but errors in judgment. Among other things, he talks of a work at Girardeau's that was nece&s;&s;ary to be erected, but it was never done; of a long narrow cau&s;eway of more than half a mile's length where the enemy advanced, and yet no &s;teps were taken, and &s;o on. But as I can obviate all he wi&s;hes to fix upon me by &s;peaking ge|nerally to the charges, and by a reference to better te&s;timony, I &s;hall wave for the pre&s;ent a particular com|ment upon his evidence (though I may now and then refer to it) after ob&s;erving that he has the mo&s;t excellent knack of interweaving accu&s;ation and comment with what he would have you think a relation of facts, of any man that ever exi&s;ted. Unluckily for him&s;elf, however, his manner of comment defeats the end he aims at; he &s;ets out upon bad <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> from which, bad as they are, he draws wor&s;e conclu&s;ions; and &s;o he appears to have the venom of the viper, without its tooth. From the &s;tations the enemy's ve&s;&s;els took, &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> appeared of an intention to land at Girardeau's; but this Court need not be told (though it may be information to Mr. Walton) that it is cu&s;tomary in war to look one way and act another, and this I <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;u&s;pected the enemy intended. Various were the landing places in Georgia, tho&s;e above the town were of ea&s;y acce&s;s to the enemy by water, &s;ome of them miles in my rear, and very near the road by which, if we <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, we were compelled to retreat, the road and river for many miles running parallel to each other; and though I had taken every mea&s;ure in my power, by &s;tationing the galleys at particular places, and by guard-<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> from them, to watch the communications clo&s;ely, yet, well aware upon what &s;lender threads the face of military movements depend, and that the lea&s;t neglect of duty or mo&s;t trifling accident might defeat the be&s;t planned &s;y&s;tem of precaution, and be productive of events of unutterable fatality, tho&s;e landing|places <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> upon me as circum&s;tances of awful con&s;ideration even where we lay; and how much more ob|noxious <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> me they might have been, had I thrown my&s;elf down on Girardeau's, and the enemy had doubled me by water, I leave to any man of military abilities to determine. Whether it has been a benefit or di&s;advantage to me to differ in opinion with &s;ome as to the &s;ituation at Girardeau's, I &s;hall not undertake to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">; but this I know, that notwith&s;tanding I might from military policy hold out the idea that the enemy would land there, and that it was very de&s;en&s;ible, I really never thought &s;o. Many circum&s;tances <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> in favour of their landing above the town, and it ever operated upon me as a matter of &s;urprize that they did not attempt it. The lea&s;t movement that way would have nece&s;&s;itated me to retreat above them, by which means the town mu&s;t have been left open to them, or, had I remained in or about it, captivity would inevitably have been the con&s;equence. The &s;ituation at Girardeau's appeared to me to have many vices, which may not perhaps have &s;truck others. I had examined it with the utmo&s;t &s;trictne&s;s, both alone and in company. I had walked over all its cau&s;eways, and through many parts of its rice-fields, and found, to my <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and &s;urprize, that not only the cau&s;eways, but the fields them&s;elves, would admit of the approach of troops to the high land, as appears to the Court by te&s;timony not to be controverted. The enemy therefore would not have been comported to attack us merely by the approach leading directly to the hou&s;e, but might, had I fixed my&s;elf there, have doubled either flank, or embraced both. Any manoeuvre like this would have made our retiring nece&s;&s;ary, and perhaps we &s;hould have been obliged to do it under fire, and by that means have rea&s;&s;umed our main po&s;ition at Fair-Lawn, in that confu&s;ion incident to young troops retreating before an enemy; be&s;ides this, the bridge and roads between Girardeau's and Fair-Lawn could not have been <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> up effectually while we were in front of them, and it might have been difficult to have done it with the enemy hanging heavily on our rear, and to leave them unimpaired might have been attended with obvious and great inconveniencies. The&s;e rea&s;ons and many others appeared to me to militate &s;trongly either again&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, my whole force at that place, or po&s;ting heavy detachments there, even if my numbers would have admitted of it, which unfortunately was far from being the ca&s;e. In &s;hort, as the enemy could ab&s;olutely command a landing where they plea&s;ed, as this place was le&s;s beneficial to them or injurious to us than <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> any other, as it left a mora&s;s in my front, with other advantages of &s;ituation, where it was probable <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> could have been oppo&s;ed with mo&s;t effect, and left me between the town and them, I had my doubts then, and I declare they exi&s;t now, whether I &s;hould not have acted with more military propriety, had I withdrawn every &s;hew of oppo&s;ition at Girardeau's, and &s;pread it out as a table to invite them to land there. The&s;e were &s;ome of the rea&s;ons which governed my conduct upon that day. They will, I flatter my&s;elf, have weight with the Court, and, if they do not convince Colonel Walton, will at lea&s;t invalidate his te&s;timony. Upon examining this ground with Colonel Roberts, commanding officer of artillery, a gentleman as di&s;tinct in character as in &s;entiment from the man la&s;t mentioned, a man of abilities in his profe&s;&s;ion, of honor, integrity and benevolence of heart, in whom were united the gentleman and the &s;oldier, who, knowing the value of reputation in him&s;elf, would have revolted at the idea of wounding it in another, who would have di&s;dained to pro&s;titute official influence to the vile purpo&s;es of private pique and per&s;onal prejudices, and who, if he mu&s;t re&s;ent, would have re&s;ented by manly ways; this officer, who has &s;ince nobly fallen in the cau&s;e of his country, from who&s;e fall the &s;ervice has received a deep wound, and of who&s;e lo&s;s I never think but the &s;igh of anxiety expands my bo&s;om, upon my a&s;king his opinion whether it was eligible to take mea&s;ures for a capital oppo&s;ition at Girardeau's, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the &s;tronge&s;t terms again&s;t it; and though I had re&s;erved my own opinion at the time I reque&s;ted his, he gave rea&s;ons very &s;imilar to tho&s;e I have uttered, and added, that he thought a &s;mart guard, not &s;o formidable as to make the enemy advert to other landing|places, or to di&s;hearten them from attempting the approach by the cau&s;eway to the hou&s;e, and yet capable of giving them a hand&s;ome check, was all he thought nece&s;&s;ary to be done. The guard at Girardeau's, under Captain Smith, had been increa&s;ed to about 70 <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, a work was to have been thrown up in the night, and
<PB N="26" REF="017772_0025_0FA2BC5B3200F6E0">
the cau&s;eway cut through within fire of the hill. Colonel Ternant has told you it could not be done for want of tools, as after all my efforts, and the efforts of the Quarter-ma&s;ter, none were obtained until it was too late. Near this po&s;t evidence demon&s;trates two guards were placed, and there certainly were others, though no proof has been had of it. Tho&s;e guards were intended by me to an&s;wer a duplicate end; that of guarding the approaches to the main body at Fair Lawn, and to &s;upport Captain Smith, as occa&s;ion &s;hould make it requi&s;ite. I believe it will be thought that as there was a variety of other places to attend to, which required men, that &s;o &s;mall a main body as I had could not well &s;pare, more than what tho&s;e detachments amounted to for any particular purpo&s;e. Two per&s;ons, who were well mounted, active, and thought tru&s;t-worthy, were ordered to attend Captain Smith, and he was directed to &s;end in&s;tant information of the fir&s;t prepara|tions of the enemy to land. One of the&s;e men was accordingly di&s;patched by the Captain at lea&s;t an hour before the firing began, but he tru&s;ted the me&s;&s;age to a third per&s;on, and went to give notice of the enemy's motions to a relation of his four or five miles off and below the po&s;t; &s;o that neither the guards in advance or I had the lea&s;t intimation of the enemy's motions until the action commenced, and con&s;equently Captain Smith mi&s;&s;ed of the &s;upport intended him, and, after behaving with great gallantry, made good his retreat. From hence I think it appears (that though I did not place my whole reliance upon the enemy's landing at Girardeau's, and approaching by the main cau&s;eway, or throw &s;o large a guard within view of them as &s;ome may think that I ought to have done) that I took mea&s;ures to &s;upport the guard, in order to a more ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance; and as the troops were kept con&s;tantly upon their arms, I &s;hould have had time, had the intelli|gence intended me by Captain Smith reached me when it ought, to have &s;upported him with the whole of the troops, had the enemy, by confining them&s;elves to the cau&s;eway, made the mea&s;ure warrantable. It mu&s;t be evident to the Court from te&s;timony, that as the field before the hou&s;e was near <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> quarters of a mile long, and that the &s;hipping commanded the end of the cau&s;eway, that it was therefore impo&s;&s;ible <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> oppo&s;e them there, and after they had gained the high land, it would have been the heighth of madne&s;s with troops &s;o inferior in number, to have attempted to meet them on the plain; for without &s;ome advantage of &s;ituation, the con&s;equence mu&s;t be obvious. It was therefore thought be&s;t by me, and by many, not to wa&s;te the men by fruitle&s;s efforts, but to withdraw the guards, and let them join their &s;everal corps at the main po&s;ition. At this place, in front, the &s;ituation was exceedingly defen&s;ible; &s;o much &s;o, that had the enemy attacked us there, I think there was every probability that the events of that day had been determined in our favour. I had rea&s;ons, which appeared to me &s;trong, to induce the belief that they would have at|tacked us in that manner. The road which led to us was wide, and though it had been broken up, &s;o as not to be pa&s;&s;able immediately under the command of a field-piece, yet it was done in &s;uch a manner that it did not appear to tho&s;e in approach till almo&s;t arrived at it. The mora&s;s in front, and the ground on each &s;ide of it, was &s;o formed, that at a very little di&s;tance the whole appeared level; and as the pa&s;&s;es on my right had no roads to them, at lea&s;t none that had been u&s;ed for a con&s;iderable time, there was a great chance that they might not advert to them. The enemy's own accounts &s;hew that my hope of their not finding the pa&s;&s;es and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> atacking me in front were well founded; for they &s;ay, in their official accounts, that this would have been the ca&s;e, had not a Negroe de&s;erted to them and become their informer and guide. The&s;e rea&s;ons, joined with the con&s;ideration that even the &s;hew of re&s;i&s;tance on our part might occa&s;ion he&s;itation and delay on their's (and half a day or even an hour was precious, as the public and private property was removing) induced me to remain where I was. Colonel Walton has a&s;&s;erted that I, by my own confe&s;&s;ion, appeared ignorant of the pa&s;&s;es on my right. It is not common, I believe, for a man to deviate from truth, where it mu&s;t in con&s;equence and obviou&s;ly make again&s;t him&s;elf; and &s;urely I mu&s;t have deviated from truth had I &s;aid &s;o, for your records teem with evidence that I was acquainted with the pa&s;&s;es. They were &s;ources of con&s;tant anxiety to me, they were in fact the di&s;ea&s;e of my po&s;ition; I <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> not cure them, nor could I guard them effectually&mdash;the next eligible thing was to watch them clo&s;ely, and who, after hearing the evidence adduced, can accu&s;e me of not having done &s;o. Patroles of hor&s;e were ordered to be continually going, &s;tationary videts were appointed, &s;everal private confidential characters, who acted as volunteers upon this occa&s;ion, be&s;ides two extra Aids-de-Camp, military characters, active, vigilant and well mounted, ap|pear in evidence to have been employed for this purpo&s;e, be&s;ides various other mea&s;ures that were pur&s;ued. Do not all the&s;e precautions demon&s;trate that I was painfully &s;en&s;ible how tender our &s;ituation was upon the right? What though I might not have known the exact &s;pot where je&s;&s;amines were to be plucked, or no&s;e|gays had been made, I was well informed of the general weakne&s;s of that part on my flank, and though I hoped the enemy might not attempt it, yet I took every method to be informed of it if they did; after which I never meant to remain on the ground a moment, as my conduct as well as the te&s;timony given in evinces. The pa&s;s the enemy availed them&s;elves of was &s;o remote on my right, that I thought I &s;hould have had time to retreat without lo&s;s, &s;hould they endeavour to pa&s;s it. Careful as I was, I have my doubts that the infor|mation was not &s;o early as I might have expected. In &s;aying this, I do not mean to reflect upon any of tho&s;e individuals who undertook to look out that way. They were re&s;pectable characters, with every ability and de&s;ire to &s;erve the cau&s;e; but it is po&s;&s;ible for accident &s;ometimes to occa&s;ion an enemy to elude the greate&s;t vigilance, and if a moment was lo&s;t, I am convinced it mu&s;t have ari&s;en from accident alone. A party was detailed for this pa&s;s, and Colonel Marbury was to have commanded it. I have it much to &s;orrow for, that any innovation took place. That re&s;pectable, &s;pirited officer would not have po&s;ted his party near the barracks, and far in the rear of the troops, but would have &s;tationed them where they ought to have been, directly on the &s;pot they were intended to guard; by which means, if all other vigilance had failed, the ac|tion between him and the enemy would have announced their approach many minute &s;ooner than the firing that did happen gave it me. But if it was criminal in me not to know this pa&s;s, what &s;hall be &s;aid of him who undertook to guard it for me, and yet took po&s;t remote from it. Colonel Walton declares to the Court, that Colonel Marbury delivered him an order from me to attack the Briti&s;h light-infantry, and relates, not indeed that he obeyed the order, but theatrically de&s;cribes his &s;ituation and the enemy's. I do not recollect, and think I may a&s;&s;ert that no &s;uch order was ever &s;ent him. If it was, can that memory, which appears to be &s;uch a faithful regi&s;ter of trifles, not be impre&s;&s;ed with the name of the per&s;on who brought the order; and &s;tranger &s;till it is that the Colonel &s;hould believe, or at lea&s;t a&s;&s;ert, that Colonel Marbury was the per&s;on
<PB N="27" REF="017772_0026_0FA2BC5C67CE8958">
who delivered it. But the deep groves and flowery bowers the Colonel had &s;trayed into, in company with fair dam&s;els, had awakened in his imagination a &s;pirit of Chivalry, and, like Knight-Errants of old romance, becomes his province, and his relations are as extraordinary as any thing in Amadis of Gaul, Pari&s;mus and Pari&s;menus, the Fairy Tales, or any other books of that &s;ort. The &s;imilarity however breaks in this, that tho&s;e fables have morals, while morals in the Colonel's fables are left out. Colonel Walton, in that part of his evidence which relates to the detaching of &s;o many of the militia-hor&s;e, by the turn of his expre&s;&s;ion, and &s;ome volunteer explo&s;ions of fancy which have not been made a record of, but which through the whole of his te&s;timony he has been too apt to let off, appears to blame me for tho&s;e detachments. They were however di&s;po&s;ed of to the be&s;t of all u&s;es our &s;ituation would admit of, that of watching the various approaches which called for attention, and which our numbers could not guard. The Colonel one would think is a little un|lucky; for where he wi&s;hes to condemn he contributes to acquit, and where he means to commend he cen|&s;ures&mdash;his friend&s;hip by this means becomes more dangerous than his enmity. I am in another place accu&s;ed, in the Colonel's te&s;timony, of retreating without &s;ending him notice of it. Notice, however, was a&s;&s;uredly &s;ent him, and was repeated by Colonel Marbury. It was not, I dare &s;ay, received, becau&s;e proba|bly the Colonel's retreat began fir&s;t, or &s;o early after me that the me&s;&s;enger might not have been arrived. Colonel Marbury mentions that one of the continental picquets had received no orders when he &s;aw it. This picquet had been put under the orders of Colonel Walton, and I believe he &s;ent directions to it to retire; but, ab&s;tracted from this, Major Porter was di&s;patched to call off the picquets, and has told you that he did do it. As I had rea&s;ons for wi&s;hing the picquets to remain on the ground a &s;hort time after the troops moved off, Major Porter might not have got to them when Colonel Marbury &s;aw them, who, having been de&s;ired to have an eye on the picquets, acted with his u&s;ual propriety in ordering that picquet off. The di&s;po&s;ition for the day is before the Court, and mu&s;t &s;peak for it&s;elf. I flatter my&s;elf it makes provi&s;ion for every proba|ble contingence, and that it will bear the in&s;pection of any military eye. From that it appears that I or|dered the army to retreat in column, as it &s;hortened the line of march, and threw the men more in the countenance of their officers; that they were to proceed by the &s;horte&s;t route to the Spring-hill defile; &s;o that I could not have the lea&s;t idea of their going into town. That this order of march and the route laid down was not or could not be pur&s;ued was a misfortune to me indeed, but ought not to be imputed to me as a fault. My friend General Elbert has ju&s;tified me as to never having given any order for it, and ju&s;tified him|&s;elf by a recital of the accidents which compelled him to deviate from the di&s;po&s;ition. That de&s;erving officer and my&s;elf have lived in a cour&s;e of friend&s;hip for a length of time, and in &s;ituations critical and intricate have &s;eldom upon military matters differed in opinion. His a&s;&s;i&s;tance and advice have laid me under obliga|tions to him, and his &s;pirit and abilities have &s;erved his country. Having omitted &s;omething relative to the &s;ituation at Girardeau's, I beg a moment's indulgence of the Court to revert to it. As mo&s;t rice-fields in that country can at times be laid under water, it may appear &s;trange to &s;ome, upon a &s;uperficial view, that Girardeau's fields were not put in that &s;tate. I had this once in object, and examined the flood-gates, but found mo&s;t of them &s;o out of repair that they would not keep in the tides; and if they could, as tho&s;e vents are &s;ituated by and empty them&s;elves into the river, they would have been under the enemy's command. Had tho&s;e objections however been out of the que&s;tion, the winds which had prevailed for &s;everal days made, as was u&s;ual to tho&s;e winds, &s;uch low tides, that until the afternoon of the 29th the lands could not have been overflowed. Mr. Wereat's evidence proves this fact. I have confe&s;&s;ed that I ordered the garri&s;on at Sunbury to evacuate the fort, and I will add that I was &s;o anxious to have it done, that my fir&s;t order was written with a pencil, on hor&s;eback, in the field, and on the retreat. Fearful that this order might mi&s;carry, and &s;till anxious for the fate of the garri&s;on, upon a halt we made about eight miles from town, I, in another letter more explicit in its content, repeated the order for evacuation, and directed, that if the &s;tores could not be removed they &s;hould be de&s;troyed, and the cannca &s;piked. This letter, and another to the &s;ame purpo&s;e not an hour afterwards, were di&s;patched by officers. Some, if not all, were received, but the Ma|jor who commanded there delayed obeying the order until he heard from me again, in con&s;equence of which he and his party fell into the enemy's hands a few days afterwards. How this order, had it been wrong in it&s;elf, &s;ince it was not obeyed, could contribute to &s;acrifice the capital and the State, let tho&s;e who framed the charge explain. I think it appears plain that nothing very erroneous in my conduct has happened, when, notwith&s;tanding a &s;trong de&s;ire to have me cen&s;ured, charges &s;o futile and ill-grounded are exhibited again&s;t me. It would have been horrid in me to have &s;uffered a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to have remained in a work too exten&s;ive for five times the number of men, ill-con&s;tructed, unfini&s;hed, without ca&s;emates, and without the lea&s;t pro|bability of relieving it. Had I done &s;o, and been arraigned for that, I &s;hould have &s;tood in this pre&s;ence with very different &s;en&s;ations than now I do; nor would I &s;o ju&s;tly have incurred the cen&s;ure of my own heart to plea&s;e the executive authority of the whole world, though every individual which compo&s;ed it had been a Colonel Commandant of Militia. Major Lane, who commanded the fort, had recently been in it &s;econd in command, when an attack upon it by the enemy had been gallantly repul&s;ed. The Magi&s;trates and citizens of the town, hoping to defend it again, &s;olicited, implored, and be&s;et him to remain in it. Combined with the&s;e, he was in the bloom of youth, in the hey-day of blood and &s;pirits&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> an enthu&s;i|a&s;tic ardour for fame, which it is better for an officer &s;ometimes to be mi&s;led by than never to feel, and which, tho' it may now and then induce exce&s;s, it is at word but the exce&s;s of a good quality. All the&s;e prevailed upon him to delay an execution of his orders, and he had his puni&s;hment in his fault. The cro&s;&s;ing of Savanna river very early after the retreat I have al&s;o confe&s;&s;ed. Some of the rea&s;ons that operated upon me mu&s;t be my defence; half of them, I pledge my&s;elf, will be a &s;ufficient ju&s;tification. The gallies and ve&s;&s;els with private and public &s;tores had been ordered to Pury&s;burgh, and had arrived; the river at that place was &s;o narrow that they mu&s;t have been lo&s;t, had they been attempted even by infantry alone. Be&s;ides this, all Carolina, as yet uninjured, was open to the enemy, and no inroad by land more eligible to them than Pury&s;burgh; the battalions in that State were reduced by the expiration of enli&s;tments to a &s;mall num|ber; the bulk of its militia lie remote from the &s;ea, and are not to be collected upon a &s;udden emergency &s;o &s;peedily as is to be wi&s;hed; the whole country between Pury&s;burgh and Charles-Town lay expo&s;ed to the ra|vages of the enemy, and was much nearer to them than Augu&s;ta; indeed, had they lo&s;t no time in Georgia,
<PB N="28" REF="017772_0027_0FA2BC5C78A51940">
but by a rapid movement had made Charles-Town their object, I think, in the then &s;ituation of affairs, their pro&s;pects of carrying it were very probable. The&s;e circum&s;tances, and &s;ome others, combined to make me pre&s;s my arrival at Pury&s;burgh, after three or four days &s;tay at the Two Si&s;ters, during which time it ap|pears I was not negligent of the inhabitants. Before I had cro&s;&s;ed the river my&s;elf, tho' mo&s;t of the troops were over, General Lincoln arrived on the other &s;ide, and &s;ent for me. Had it been proper to proceed to Augu&s;ta, we were as near to it from thence as from the &s;ide I had left, and the General no doubt would have adopted the mea&s;ure; but matters &s;o plainly pointed out to him the nece&s;&s;ity of ha&s;tening to Pury&s;|burgh, that the troops were ordered to march by dawn of day, and we had but ju&s;t got to that place when advanced parties of the enemy appeared on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the ferry, which demon&s;trated the rectitude of the mea&s;ure of arriving there as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. The&s;e rea&s;ons, if they ju&s;tify at all, will have force as to call|ing down the few troops that were at Augu&s;ta; and the&s;e General Lincoln, who&s;e prudence is not to be doubted, would likewi&s;e have remanded, had it been requi&s;ite. Colonel Walton told the Court in &s;ome part of his evi|dence, that I gave a&s;&s;urances to the inhabitants that I would defend the town. By this it would appear, if you take it &s;ingly, as he no doubt would have you to do, that I had pledged my&s;elf to the people at all events to de|fend them, lulling them thereby into a &s;tate of ab&s;olute &s;ecurity, and by that means inducing them to remain with their effects. Upon further examination, however, the&s;e a&s;&s;urances, even by his own account of them, amount to no more than my &s;peaking of the compo&s;ition of the enemy's troops, in a way which might in&s;pirit tho&s;e who heard me to exert them&s;elves in defence. It was not &s;urely my province to di&s;pirit a people who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance I wanted, both for their &s;akes and my own; but certain it is I mentioned to many of the inhabitants the removal of their goods as a cautionary &s;tep for fear of accident, and this I think may appear from Mr. Wereat's evidence. I recommended it more than once to the Governor, who&s;e duty it was to advi&s;e the in|habitants upon this head, and I am con&s;cious I have nothing to accu&s;e my&s;elf of upon this occa&s;ion. This al&s;o I &s;hould have mentioned &s;ooner, and I beg the excu&s;e of the Court for not having done &s;o; but in &s;uch a farrago of evidence as the Colonel's, where facts are &s;o few, and &s;o wrapped up in beliefs, &s;uppo&s;itions and opinions, no wonder if one or two of them &s;hould e&s;cape being unfolded. Mr. Sheftall, the Deputy Commi&s;&s;ary General of I&s;&s;ues, has been brought by the pro&s;ecutors to prove upon me, as I &s;uppo&s;e, a ne|glect of the public &s;tores. I have ever had a favourable opinion of Mr. Sheftall as an hone&s;t man, and from the te&s;timony of &s;uch I knew I had nothing to fear; his evidence therefore is in my favour. Many mea&s;ures however were pur&s;ued, that Mr. Sheftall might have had no knowledge of. It was in the Deputy Quarter Ma&s;ter General's department to provide ve&s;&s;els and carriages for the removal of &s;tores. Colonel Wily, who filled this office, was a man of rank, character and activity. He was directed to, and I am &s;ure did pur&s;ue every method to obtain them, both by him&s;elf and a very active Deputy, Doctor Wadden; but their efforts were in vain. The ve&s;&s;els at that time at Savanna were either the property of private individuals, or in their employment. On board of the&s;e, as it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, the inhabitants were crouding their effects, and the&s;e ve&s;&s;els by civil means could not be obtained. I might indeed, by dint of bayonet, have tumbled out of the ve&s;&s;els both the people and their effects; but humanity, honor and con&s;cience militated again&s;t it. I have warred to pre&s;erve civil rights, and pride my&s;elf in the thought that I have never violated them. But had I been &s;o dead to every &s;en&s;e of feeling, &s;hould I not have been liable to the actions of each of tho&s;e I had injured, and who would, who ought to have indemnified me? A ve&s;&s;el, as appears, was at la&s;t procured, capable of receiving the &s;tores, and a party was then furni&s;hed (and it would have been u&s;ele&s;s to have done it before) to move the &s;tores to the wharff; but the ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el, alarmed a long while &s;ooner than he need to have been, ran away with the ve&s;&s;el and left the &s;tores behind. It appears in evidence, that upon the inva&s;ion of Georgia from Ea&s;t Florida I gave it, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, my per&s;onal aid; that I ordered on a body of continental troops, which &s;oon followed; that militia likewi&s;e upon that occa&s;ion were to come in from Carolina. Before the&s;e were collected, the troops from Ea&s;t Florida had retired; but upon the intelli|gence given by the de&s;erter from the tran&s;port of an intended inva&s;ion under Colonel Campbell, they were not countermanded, but arrived in Savanna. They came about the middle of December, and were after &s;ome time di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, I know not why, by the Governor of Georgia. It has al&s;o been given in evidence, that I reque&s;ted of the Governor of Georgia all the militia he could collect. It appears al&s;o to the Court, as I flatter my&s;elf, that every circum&s;tance which had a claim to my attention received it, and particularly that on the retreat I paid every po&s;&s;ible attention to the men. Some di&s;tance on the retreat I halted until the whole were pa&s;t me, and a better organized column I have &s;eldom &s;een even upon parade. Ju&s;t at this time, I had intelligence that a party of Briti&s;h were &s;een coming down the Ogechee road, a good way beyond the barracks. Upon this I galloped to where General Huger was, and ob&s;erving that this body of the enemy, though at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, &s;eemed ha&s;tening to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Spring-hill defile, I de&s;ired General Huger to proceed there, &s;ee in what manner Major Wi&s;e, who had been &s;ent there with a party and ordered to de|fend the pa&s;s to the la&s;t man, had po&s;ted them, and, if he thought more men requi&s;ite, to reinforce the party with the advanced guard of the line, or take off as many platoons from the head of the column as he &s;hould think proper. Directly after this I was returning to the rear, but when I came to the artillery found the troops that I left in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> rear of it mi&s;&s;ing. Upon this I &s;ent orders to the troops in front to ha&s;ten their march for the defile, and directed Colonel Roberts to pre&s;s on the artillery, as I was anxious for its fate, as its rear was now in air. When I came to the defile, I found General Huger had po&s;ted the party to my entire &s;atisfac|tion, and that gallant officer offering to head it, I accepted his offer, and told him I would remain with him. We &s;taid &s;ome time there under a pretty &s;mart fire, hoping that the troops mi&s;&s;ing, or &s;ome part of them, might arrive; but being informed by &s;ome per&s;on who came out of the town, that he &s;aw them going to|wards Yamacraw, and as the Carolina brigade with the artillery had entirely pa&s;&s;ed the defile, and was &s;ome di&s;tance on their retreat, all object for remaining there cea&s;ed, and we retired to the other end of the pa&s;s, where again we made &s;ome &s;tand, after which we halted no more until we reached Cherokee-hill. What more could be expected of me I am at a lo&s;s to know. The reputation of a man is in great danger of &s;uf|fering, at lea&s;t for a time, when pro&s;ecutions are commenced again&s;t him under the au&s;pices of a State. Mankind at large will be apt to &s;uppo&s;e that he might be faulty, when the majority of a community appear
<PB N="29" REF="017772_0028_0FA2BC5D366D3E28" MS="y">
to think him &s;o, and perhaps the conclu&s;ion is commonly ju&s;t. If characters in general are in this way vulner|able, military characters in particular are much more obnoxious to the wound. There exi&s;ts in republican governments a jealou&s;y, perhaps laudable, of men of the &s;word. The glare of the character excites the envy of the vulgar, and as the gallantry of the profe&s;&s;ion &s;eems to elevate tho&s;e who adopt it above the common level, men feel a malignant happine&s;s in pulling them down. If this be a fault, it is a fault in human nature, which, though it may bear hard upon individuals, is not perhaps without its &s;ocial benefits. It may &s;often that haughtine&s;s, but too apt to infect the minds of military men, and make them correct that de&s;poti&s;m of temper, which a long habit of being implicitly obeyed is but too apt to induce, fix in their remembrance the relation they bear and the duty they owe to civil &s;ociety, and e&s;tabli&s;h in them a courte&s;y of conduct to their fellow-citizens (which might otherwi&s;e for&s;ake them) when they reflect that even their favorite mi&s;tre&s;s, Fame, is enjoyed upon the precarious tenure of retaining the good-will of the people. The right in States, however, to cen&s;ure and arraign is a prerogative of a delicate nature, the dignity of which con&s;i&s;ts in a very &s;paring and very judicious u&s;e of it&mdash;and hard is the fate of that man, again&s;t whom a State &s;ets it&s;elf.&mdash;Whether he be right or wrong&mdash;it is not but upon the mo&s;t palpable certainty of his de|&s;erving it, that they ought to do it. Hard, however, as it is, it is the duty of every man to &s;ubmit. It is a tax he owes to the public, which, though he pays with anxiety, he &s;hould pay without murmuring. This is more particularly incumbent upon military men, who, upon every occa&s;ion, &s;hould demon&s;trate to com|munity that they have not &s;unk the idea of a citizen in that of a &s;oldier. Actuated by &s;entiments like the&s;e, I now pay my tribute to the State of Georgia, in full confidence that the events of this trial will prove to them, that I faithfully whil&s;t with them, to the utmo&s;t of my abilities, &s;trove to fill the mea&s;ure of my duty both to them and the common cau&s;e, and that where malice and mi&s;repre&s;entation have prevailed upon them to cen&s;ure me mo&s;t, I lea&s;t of all have de&s;erved it at their hands. I was very early in this conte&s;t impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of the great importance of the State of Georgia to the common weal. It was this conviction of their worth, joined to the true re&s;pect and good-will I bore them, that made me &s;o often pre&s;s upon them the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of taking mea&s;ures to place them&s;elves in a &s;tate of defence. It was this which made me point out to them, in the &s;tronge&s;t expre&s;&s;ions I was ma&s;ter of, that, affailable as they were at a variety of places, they were at none prepared for defence; that while other States were exerting them&s;elves to be in the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;tate of &s;ecurity, they remained &s;o unprepared, that they &s;eemed to invite an attack; that, de&s;titute as they were of arms, ammunition, military &s;tores and implements of all kinds, they ought without lo&s;s of time to exert them&s;elves to obtain them; that their internal re&s;ources not being very great, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance from other States too remote upon &s;udden emergency to be had in time, that they ought therefore to put them&s;elves, by works, in a &s;ituation to maintain their country until collateral aids could be called in, and that all idea of expence &s;hould be lo&s;t in the importance of the object. This I reiterated upon them, as their records will &s;hew, and have it much to lament that I reiterated in vain. Colonel Walton could have told you this, for he was of the body to which I &s;poke it, and candour &s;hould have exacted of him at lea&s;t to have told it to the admini&s;tration, which, after his liberation from captivity, he had the ingenuity to cre|ate; but it was not popular to inform them of the fatal apathy which pervaded the former Legi&s;latures, in which he him&s;elf had no incon&s;iderable &s;hare. The State of Georgia laboured under peculiar di&s;advantages. The climate was thought much more unfavourable to exotic con&s;titutions than it really was. The govern|ment had originally been military, con&s;equently not congenial to liberty. A number of men of liberal &s;entiments were therefore di&s;couraged from re&s;orting there, and though it contained at <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> many characters equal in every particular to any in other States, yet, comparatively to thick <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ettled countries, they were but a few. A number of the&s;e had been appointed to places of honorary or pecuniary emolument under the crown, and mo&s;t of them, as has been common in other States, withdrew them&s;elves when the conte&s;t waxed warm. From the &s;elect few that remained, their civil and military officers were appointed, who, by a fatal clau&s;e in the con&s;titution of the State, were rendered inelegible to any &s;hare in their Legi&s;lature. By this means, not &s;o great a choice of characters as was to be wi&s;hed remained, and many floated into notice who had otherwi&s;e remained out of view. A number of the&s;e, however innocent, were totally unconver&s;ant in pub|lic affairs, and &s;o were liable to be fa&s;hioned by the crafty and de&s;igning. Thus a Gwinnet, a Truitland, a Hou&s;ton and a Walton became their Governors; thus de&s;ign and &s;elf-intere&s;t became the ruling principle of admini&s;tration; and thus I became an object of per&s;ecution. The thunder however, as I under&s;tand, &s;lept until Mr. Walton awakened it. For tho' a government had been &s;et up &s;ome months before he came out, yet not one word of complaint, I believe, had officially been heard of again&s;t me. This government, it is true, had not been con&s;titutionally e&s;tabli&s;hed; becau&s;e &s;o many of the Repre&s;entatives of the State had evacuated it, that the numbers &s;et forth by the con&s;titution as adequate to the choice of a Pre&s;ident and Council could not be collected. Tho&s;e, however, who remained, alarmed by the enormities which for want of government were daily committed with impunity, thought them&s;elves warranted by nece&s;&s;ity to deviate from common rules, and therefore met and elected public officers. The per&s;ons cho&s;en were men of real patrioti&s;m; and feeling a reluctance to a&s;&s;ume powers not con&s;titutionally ve&s;ted in them, they forebore proceeding to executive operations until mo&s;t, if not all, of the people of the State had &s;anctified their nomination, by reque&s;ting to be governed by them. Some time alter this, Mr. Walton returns from captivity, and though this government was progre&s;&s;ing fa&s;t to its periodical di&s;&s;olution, even that &s;hort time was too long for a man of his &s;trong a&s;pirations after power to wait. A few members of A&s;|&s;embly, much le&s;s than the number which &s;et up the other Governor, were therefore by &s;ome means got together, and Mr. Walton is elected Governor, and other public officers nominated. Thus two admini&s;trations actually exi&s;ted at one moment in the &s;ame State, a phoenomenon in the world of civil policy almo&s;t as much to be wondered at, as if two Suns appeared at the &s;ame time in one firmament in the natural world. During this government, if &s;o it may be called, of Mr. Walton's, and which a verv re|&s;pectable

<P><HI>10</HI>th. WE pre&s;ent, as a manife&s;t breach of the con&s;titution, a meeting compo&s;ed of about the number of twenty per&s;ons, in the month of November la&s;t, who called them&s;elves <HI>the Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly,</HI> and actually a&s;&s;umed and exerci&s;ed the legi&s;lative and executive powers of government, contrary to the expre&s;s letter and &s;pirit of the con&s;titu|tion, which we conceive to be a precedent dangerous to the rights and liberties of the good people of this State; for if any number of men, &s;hort of the number pre&s;cribed in and by the con&s;titution, can exerci&s;e the legi&s;lative autho|rity, any given number may, the liberties of the people may be invaded, and the wor&s;t of tyranny &s;et up and e&s;tabli&s;hed.

</LETTER></NOTE> the letter to Congre&s;s mentioning the operations of the 29th of December with di&s;approbation took its ri&s;e; and though my name is not mentioned in it, yet the events of that day are &s;poken of in &s;uch terms, that they appear to be intended as the foundation for &s;ub&s;e|quent proce&s;s. This letter had the name of Mr. Gla&s;cock, Speaker of the Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, affixed to it; but Mr. Gla&s;cock has written to Congre&s;s ab&s;olutely di&s;avowing it, and be&s;towing upon it the epithet of a vile forgery. Mr. Walton's government, like Sancho's of old, running rapidly to di&s;&s;olution, another, at the time fixed by the con&s;titution, takes its ri&s;e; and though Mr. Walton was no longer Governor, he &s;till continued a member of its Legi&s;lature, and I became arraigned for the charges before you. I have not the lea&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of blame to ca&s;t on the A&s;&s;embly at large. In the light I was &s;hewn to them, their treat|ment of me has been proper. They were labouring under the pre&s;&s;ure of di&s;tre&s;s, were made &s;ore by the ca|lamities of war. It was natural for them to enquire into the origin of their misfortunes. It would not have been popular or &s;afe to let them recollect, that &s;ome of the very men they had inve&s;ted with authority had been leading men in all the mea&s;ures of the State precedent to its misfortunes; that they had been dead to every &s;en&s;e of danger, or criminally negligent of every means of averting it, and this notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t animated and pointed applications to them to fall upon mea&s;ures to place their country in a &s;tate of de|fence, and for want of which it at la&s;t fell a melancholy &s;acrifice. To prevent this recollection, it became nece&s;&s;ary to divert their attention to another object, and who &s;o convenient as him who had been the military commander of the department? He was a thou&s;and miles ab&s;ent from the &s;cene of accu&s;ation, and con&s;e|quently could not defend him&s;elf. He had no connexions of con&s;anguinity or affinity to take his part, was an alien to the State, and mo&s;t of the friends he had obtained in it in cour&s;e of acquaintance were ab&s;ent as well as him&s;elf. He therefore was proper game to run at, and it was determined to hunt him down. Per&s;onal prejudices in one of the leaders &s;timulated al&s;o to this mea&s;ure, &s;o that &s;elfi&s;h policy and inveteracy united in the chace. Hence has per&s;ecution been let loo&s;e upon me, and every method tried to ruin my fame. The embers of time have been raked up, to &s;ee if no &s;park of error was to be found, that the breath of malevolence might puff it into flame. After three long years have pa&s;&s;ed by, I am called to trial for actions, when the motives of many of them might have been forgotten by my&s;elf. In &s;hort, every mea&s;ure has been pur&s;ued to immolate my reputation upon the altar of malice; but I tru&s;t, I know it has been tried in vain. Had I, in &s;o early a period of the war, committed any military error in judgment, my zeal in the common cau&s;e, and my unabating efforts to promote it, would have induced any man, to who&s;e bo&s;om the lea&s;t ray of candour could find its way, to ca&s;t a veil over the mi&s;take. To the &s;ervice of my country, I glory in having devoted my|&s;elf. Six years have clap&s;ed, and, a few weeks excepted, I have never a&s;ked or accepted one moment's re|ce&s;s from &s;ervice; for to &s;ervice I have &s;acrificed all other con&s;iderations, however intere&s;ting, endearing or heart-felt they might have been. Should illiberal minds cen&s;ure me for being too much of an egoti&s;t in &s;aying this, let them be taught that there are occa&s;ions which warrant a man's &s;peaking of him&s;elf, and that my enemies have involved me in this predicament. The length of time that has pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the tran&s;actions happened for which I am under trial, though a great, is not the mo&s;t capital di&s;advantage I &s;u&s;tain. Ac|cident has deprived me of many of my official papers; and many, not thinking they would have been u&s;eful to me, have been de&s;troyed by my&s;elf. I feel the want of them mo&s;t &s;everely on this day. They would have e&s;&s;entially elucidated many parts of my conduct through the cour&s;e of a command, in various circum|&s;tances intricate, critical, perplexing and vexatious. But above all, I lament the ab&s;ence of a Secretary and an Aid de Camp, who, having lived with me long in uninterrupted intimacy and confidence, were acquainted with the minutiae and aggregate of my conduct; had been with me often in Georgia, and re&s;ided there with me for months at a time; copied all my orders and official letters; knew with what earne&s;tne&s;s I &s;trove, and what &s;acrifices I made to avoid any conte&s;t with the executive of that State; and that &s;uch was my regard for civil rights, that I never did by military exertion, what with &s;afety to &s;ervice could be done by the authority of a con&s;table. This indeed may not be &s;o immediately nece&s;&s;ary to my defence again&s;t the matter with which I am charged; but, trained as I have been in republican principles, the reverence I bear to civil au|thority, to which it is my pride and plea&s;ure to be &s;ubordinate, makes every appearance of conte&s;t with it a matter wounding to my happine&s;s, and I &s;hould have been glad, &s;ince conte&s;t did happen, to have &s;hewn that I could not avoid it. The evidence now, Mr. Pre&s;ident, and my defence are gone through: the re&s;ult is with you and the Court. I have to thank you, and through you the Court al&s;o, for your attention to me during a trial, made longer than it need to have been by a number of untoward accidents. I flatter my&s;elf, that very little of the delay that has happened can be imputed to me. A day or two excepted, when I was truly too indi&s;po&s;ed to attend you, I can accu&s;e my&s;elf of none. On the part of the Court. I am glad to bear te&s;timony of the happy blend of candour and &s;trictne&s;s, with which through the whole of this trial evi|dences have been examined, and in which the dignity of a Court Military &s;o much con&s;i&s;ts. I wait, Sir, with impatience for your &s;entence. To military &s;en&s;ibility in my &s;ituation, a moment is an eternity. My

honor is in your hands; it is a &s;acred depo&s;it, but I know, I feel it will be returned to me unimpaired; and I long to have re&s;tored to me that &s;word, which I have always worn with honor, and &s;hall never, I flatter my&s;elf, lay a&s;ide with di&s;grace.</P>
<P>THE Court, after maturely con&s;idering the charges, evidences and defence, find General Howe not guilty of the fir&s;t charge.&mdash;They find that General Howe cro&s;&s;ed the Savanna river, and ordered the evacua|tion of Sunbury and Augu&s;ta, but are of opinion that tho&s;e mea&s;ures were nece&s;&s;ary and military; and therefore do acquit him of both charges with the HIGHEST HONOR.</P>
