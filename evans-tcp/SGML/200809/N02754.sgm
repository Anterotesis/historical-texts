<Q><BIBL><HI>JOHN xv. 22.</HI></BIBL>
<P>&mdash;Now they have no Cloke for their Sin.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THAT our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t came into the World to &s;ave Sinners, is a faithful Saying, worthy of all Acceptation: And it might be mo&s;t rea&s;o|nably expected, that mi&s;erable guilty Man &s;hould give him a joyful and ready Re|ception. But alas! he is de&s;pi&s;ed and re|jected of men. In the days of his Fle&s;h <HI>he came to his own, but his own received him not.</HI> We find him very frequently complaining of the Neglects and Affronts he met with among his own people, the <HI>Jews</HI>: upbraiding them with their Ob&s;ti|nacy and Impenitence, &amp; declaring them to be inexcu&s;able.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="003281_0004_0FF03CF471BE5830">He tells his Di&s;ciples, in our <HI>Context,</HI> that they too mu&s;t expect to meet with Indignities and Per&s;ecutions from a ma|lignant World, on his Account. <HI>They will hate you and per&s;ecute you,</HI> &s;ays Chri&s;t; <HI>and all for my Name's &s;ake, becau&s;e they know not him that &s;ent me.</HI> He makes their Ig|norance of God to be the Cau&s;e of their Enmity to Chri&s;t and his People.</P>
<P>But to prevent their abu&s;ing this Ex|pre&s;&s;ion of his, and turning it into an Apo|logy for their guilty Refu&s;al of Chri&s;t, and Per&s;ecution of his Di&s;ciples, he &s;aw fit to add, as in the Ver&s;e out of which I have taken my Text, <HI>If I had not come and &s;poken to them, they had not had Sin: but now they have no Cloke for their Sin.</HI></P>
<P>Chri&s;t came and &s;pake in per&s;on to the Men of that Generation; preached the Kingdom of God, and manife&s;ted his Name unto them, revealed the Father, and proved him&s;elf to be the Son of God, the true Me&s;&s;iah; he preached Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s in the great Congregation, and declared to them the Things of their ever|la&s;ting Peace, wooing and be&s;eeching them to be reconciled to God, and ac|cept of the great Salvation offer'd them. Had he not thus done, <HI>they had not had Sin,</HI> i. e. they had not been chargeable
<PB REF="003281_0005_0FF03CF917179F00">
with this <HI>kind</HI> of &s;in, <HI>viz.</HI> Unbelief, which is one of the greate&s;t Sins, being again&s;t the tender Mercies of a Redeemer, and the clear Light of the Go&s;pel: Or it may mean, they had not had this <HI>Degree</HI> of Sin; for had they not had the Go&s;pel preached to them, their Sins had not been &s;o heinous and aggravated.</P>
<P>If they had never heard of Chri&s;t and Salvation by him, they had had no Sin, comparatively no Sin. But <HI>&s;ince I have come and &s;poken to them</HI> (&s;ays Chri&s;t) their Guilt is very aggravated, and they have no Pretence, no Excu&s;e, to palliate their Hatred and Refu&s;al of me.</P>
<P>Now the &s;ame may be &s;aid of Impeni|tent Sinners under the Go&s;pel, who tho' they profe&s;s to know Chri&s;t, yet in Works deny him. Chri&s;t is &s;till coming to us, tho' not in per&s;on, yet by his Mini&s;ters, and &s;peaking to us in his Word. So that we who profe&s;s the Go&s;pel, and yet don't live up to our Profe&s;&s;ion, but practically refu&s;e Chri&s;t, I &s;ay, we &s;hall be inexcu|&s;able, as much as the men of that Gene|ration, who &s;aw Je&s;us in the Fle&s;h, and received the Call of the Go&s;pel immedi|ately from his ble&s;&s;ed Lips. If we die in our Sins from under the Light of the Go&s;|pel, we &s;hall have no Covering nor Colour
<PB N="4" REF="003281_0006_0FF03CFA9B44A2F8">
of Excu&s;e for our Unbelief: but in the day, when God will reckon with us, &s;hall be altogether &s;peechle&s;s &amp; &s;elf-condemned.</P>
<P>The DOCTRINE then from the Words may be this, <HI>Viz.</HI></P>
<Q>That Go&s;pel-Impenitents have no po&s;&s;ible Cloke for their Sin, but are of all men the mo&s;t inexcu&s;able: having none to blame but them&s;elves, if they peri&s;h at la&s;t.</Q>
<P>By Go&s;pel-Impenitents, I mean both &s;uch as reject the Go&s;pel in point of Be|lief, and tho&s;e that reject it in point of practice. Wherefore it may be &s;aid,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>Tho&s;e that reject the Go&s;pel in point of</HI> Belief, <HI>have no Cloke for their Sin.</HI></P>
<P>The Infidelity of the <HI>Jews</HI> was inex|cu&s;able; and much more the Infidelity of &s;uch as have had their Birth and Edu|cation in places of Go&s;pel-Light. There are multitudes in Chri&s;tendom that are <HI>Dei&s;ts</HI> (&s;o called) who reject Divine Reve|lation, and &s;et up for a natural Religion in oppo&s;ition to all in&s;tituted &amp; reveal'd Re|ligion. They deny the great My&s;teries of Chri&s;tianity, and renounce the peculi|ar Precepts of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="003281_0007_0FF03CFCF01BBC20">But &s;urely they act a mo&s;t unrea&s;ona|ble and inexcu&s;able part herein. For if we con&s;ult the familiar Dictates of our own Rea&s;on, and throw a&s;ide carnal Pre|judices, we mu&s;t acknowledge the Expe|dience and Nece&s;&s;ity of a Divine Reve|lation; whether we con&s;ider Man in his innocent State, or in his fallen State. When God had made Man, having made him a capable Subject of moral Govern|ment, the Wi&s;dom, Ju&s;tice and Goodne&s;s of God &s;eem'd to require that he &s;hould place him under &s;ome Law, guarded and enforced with &s;uitable Sanctions: and if &s;uch a Law or Covenant were made for Man, it was nece&s;&s;ary it &s;hould be re|veal'd to him: for as <HI>where there's no Law, there is no Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion,</HI> &s;o where the Law is not publi&s;h'd and bro't to the Knowledge of Men, <HI>Sin is not imputed.</HI> But much more nece&s;&s;ary is it, in the Ca&s;e of <HI>fallen</HI> Man, that God &s;hould make a Revelation of his Mind and Will unto us. Our Ca&s;e indi&s;pen&s;ably requir'd it; for we are blinded by our Lu&s;ts, and alie|nated from the Life of God thro' the Ig|norance that is in us: and without a Di|vine Light hung out from Heaven, to illuminate our paths, we mu&s;t have walk|ed in Darkne&s;s even until now, and all
<PB N="6" REF="003281_0008_0FF03CFF2D4FCEC8">
the Di&s;coveries of human Rea&s;on would never have &s;ufficed to conduct us unto our chief End and true Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>And it was certainly a Thing worthy of the ble&s;&s;ed God to take &s;o much Pity upon a lo&s;t World, as to reveal him&s;elf unto them, tell them their Danger, and their Remedy, and proclaim the purpo|&s;es of his Grace toward them. It is un|rea&s;onable therefore to doubt whether God has made a Revelation.</P>
<P>And 'tis as unrea&s;onable to doubt whe|ther this Revelation, which God has made, be contain'd in the holy Bible, the Wri|tings of the Prophets and Apo&s;tles, com|monly call'd the Scriptures of the Old and New Te&s;tament. For here all the evi|dent Marks of a Divine Revelation ap|pear to every impartial Inquirer. Whe|ther you con&s;ider the intrin&s;ick Excellen|cies of the Chri&s;tian Religion, as exhibited in the Scriptures, or the external Advan|tages wherewith it comes recommended to us, &s;uch as the Te&s;timony of Mira|cles, of Chri&s;t's Re&s;urrection from the Dead, the Accompli&s;hment of Prophecies, and the like; it mu&s;t be allow'd that <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> has all the Proof and Confir|mation that it needs, or that any Reli|gion can have. Wherever the Go&s;pel
<PB N="7" REF="003281_0009_0FF03D01740B0B38">
comes, it brings with it the &s;tronge&s;t Mo|tives of Credibility; carries with it the mo&s;t convincing &s;elf-evidencing Light, added to the force of external Te&s;timony.</P>
<P>Surely then &s;uch as do not embrace Chri&s;tianity, but reject the Go&s;pel, when brought unto them, mu&s;t needs be voted ob&s;tinate, unrea&s;onable, &amp; without Excu&s;e, Act. 13.46. <HI>It was nece&s;&s;ary that the word of God &s;hould fir&s;t have been &s;poken to you: but &s;eeing ye put it from you, and judge your &s;elves unworthy of everla&s;ting life; lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</HI></P>
<P>But I pa&s;s to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>They that reject the Go&s;pel in point of</HI> Practice, <HI>who profe&s;s to receive the Chri&s;tian Religion, but at the &s;ame time live in a moral Oppo&s;ition to it, the&s;e al&s;o have no Cloke for their Sin.</HI></P>
<P>Practical Unbelief is damning, as well as &s;peculative Disbelief; and impenitent Pro|fe&s;&s;ors have as little Cloke for their Sin, as very Infidels.</P>
<P>Alas! how many are there under the Go&s;pel, that practically refu&s;e Chri&s;t, and trample under foot the Son of God! They refu&s;e him as a <HI>Prophet,</HI> by not applying to him for the Illuminations they need, and by neglecting his holy Word. They re|fu&s;e him as a <HI>Prie&s;t,</HI> by going about to
<PB N="8" REF="003281_0010_0FF03D03B9C46038">
e&s;tabli&s;h their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and not &s;ubmitting to the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of God. They refu&s;e him al&s;o as a <HI>King,</HI> by not walking in his Ways, but rebelling again&s;t his Commandments. There are many profe&s;s'd Chri&s;tians, that are openly vicious; others that are &s;e|cretly wicked; deceived, &s;erving divers lu&s;ts; having a form of Godline&s;s, but denying the power thereof. Multitudes there are under the Go&s;pel, to whom one or other of the&s;e Characters doth belong. And if they die in their Sins, they mu&s;t peri&s;h without a Remedy. Chri&s;t will reject all their Confidences; and when they plead, <HI>Lord, Lord, have we not pro|phe&s;ied in thy Name, and in thy Name done many wonderful works?</HI> he will pour con|tempt on their vain pretences, and &s;ay to them <HI>Depart from me, I know you not.</HI> He will upbraid them, &s;aying, <HI>I have call'd, but ye refu&s;ed: and now you have no Cloke for your Sin.</HI></P>
<P>Verily in that day, when Chri&s;t &s;hall judge the World in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, every mouth will be &s;topped. Even the <HI>Gen|tiles,</HI> who &s;hall peri&s;h without the Law, will be found <HI>without Excu&s;e</HI> (Rom. 1.20.) How much more <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> who have &s;inned again&s;t clearer Light and
<PB N="9" REF="003281_0011_0FF03D060438B040">
better Means of Conviction! Thou art inexcu&s;able, O man, whoever thou art, that refu&s;e&s;t him which &s;peaketh to thee from Heaven in the glorious Go&s;pel. Thine own Con&s;cience mu&s;t needs condemn thee, and &s;ilence all the vain pleas and rea&s;on|ings of a carnal Mind. Thy Con&s;cience, O guilty Man, mu&s;t needs acquit God, and lay all the Blame on thy &s;elf, if thou pe|ri&s;he&s;t from under the Go&s;pel. Thou art lifted up to Heaven, in point of privile|ges; and if thou be ca&s;t down to Hell, thy de&s;truction will &s;urely be of thy &s;elf. You can't lay the Blame on any thing <HI>without</HI> your &s;elf, whether God, or Satan, or the World; but if you peri&s;h, it is be|cau&s;e you love Death, and refu&s;e Life.</P>
<P>Sinners are apt to excu&s;e them&s;elves, as if no Blame belong'd to them, that they don't repent and believe. In ca&s;e of gro&s;s Immorality, awaken'd Sinners are ready to condemn them&s;elves: but in this matter of Unbelief and Impenitence, men have generally little &s;en&s;e of Guilt, and are di&s;pos'd to vindicate them&s;elves, as if it were none of their Fault. But alas! they are mi&s;erably deceived, and flatter them|&s;elves in their own Eyes, when they ima|gine that their Unbelief is but their Mi|&s;ery, and not their Sin.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="003281_0012_0FF03D0852043A78">To &s;et this matter in a convincing Light, I &s;hall &s;hew di&s;tinctly,</P>
<P N="1">1. That Sinners can't lay the Blame on <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. They can't lay it on <HI>Satan</HI> or the <HI>World.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Hence they mu&s;t needs take it to <HI>them&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P>Prop. I. <HI>Go&s;pel-Impenitents, who finally re|ject Chri&s;t, have no Cloke for their Sin, from a|ny Pleas or Pretences they can make relating to GOD their Maker.</HI></P>
<P>The corrupt Rea&s;on of a carnal Mind may &s;ugge&s;t many Objections and Excu|&s;es, from the Decree of God, from the In&s;ufficiency of the Means, from his with-holding nece&s;&s;ary A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the like. But they are all vain Pleas; The Scriptures allow none of them: but not|with&s;tanding all the&s;e Excu&s;es, they fa&s;ten the Guilt of Unbelief upon Go&s;pel-Sinners, and charge them with being the faulty Cau&s;es of their own Impenitency and Ruin. Hence that of our Saviour, Joh. 5.40. <HI>Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</HI> So Matth. 23.37. <HI>How often would I have gathered thy children to|gether, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="003281_0013_0FF03D34E5878758">For the Illu&s;tration of the Head we are upon, let it be con&s;ider'd,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Go&s;pel-Impenitents can't plead, They are not</HI> invited <HI>to believe in Chri&s;t for Sal|vation.</HI> Some may be apt to plead in Excu&s;e of them&s;elves, that they have not tho&s;e Qualifications, which are &s;ometimes mention'd in the Go&s;pel-Invitation; as where it's &s;aid, Come unto me, all ye that <HI>labour</HI>; If any man <HI>thir&s;ty,</HI> let him come to me, and drink. But then 'tis to be con&s;ider'd, that in &s;uch places the Go&s;pel-Invitation is only <HI>apply'd</HI> to &s;ome particu|lar Subjects; not re&s;train'd to them. Such kind of per&s;ons are the next Objects of Go&s;pel-Calls and Offers, who are under Convictions and Awakenings. But yet unconvinced Sinners are remote Objects of the &s;ame Offers. They are call'd up|on to con&s;ider Chri&s;t, and are requir'd to hunger and thir&s;t after Righteou&s;ne&s;s; They are commanded to believe in Chri&s;t, and have the Tenders of Salvation made to them in ca&s;e of their &s;o doing. The Go&s;pel-Invitation runs in indefinite Terms, <HI>Who&s;oever will,</HI> let him come. There's a <HI>general Liberty</HI> given men to believe in Chri&s;t for Salvation: This is made the Duty of all, whether willing or unwilling:
<PB N="12" REF="003281_0014_0FF03D0A9F7D3FB0">
Ab&s;olute Promi&s;es of Pardon and Salva|tion are made to all that actually do be|lieve: and the Conditional Offer is made to all where the Go&s;pel comes. The Ex|ternal Call of the Go&s;pel warrants every one's coming to Chri&s;t, that will: and none are excluded from his &s;aving Bene|fits, but &s;uch as exclude them&s;elves by an ob&s;tinate Unbelief. None then under the Go&s;pel can object that they are not invi|ted; and &s;o they have not this to plead in Excu&s;e for their not coming to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Let it now be ob&s;erv'd,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>None have it to plead that they are not</HI> elected: <HI>'Tis no Excu&s;e, that they don't know whether the Decree of God be for them or not.</HI></P>
<P>It's true, all that belong to the Election of Grace &s;hall come to Chri&s;t, &amp; obtain Salvation. Act. 13.41. <HI>As many as were ordained to eternal life, believed.</HI> And 'tis as certain, that all who are not elected, will not come to Chri&s;t, nor obtain Sal|vation. Rom. 11.7. <HI>The election hath ob|tained it, and the re&s;t were blinded.</HI></P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, this Doctrine needs not; and &s;hould not di&s;courage any one from a Care of believing in Chri&s;t, &s;ince the Go&s;pel-Call runs in indefinite Language: For, as no Man can be &s;ure of his
<PB N="13" REF="003281_0015_0FF03D375EB0AC98">
<HI>Election,</HI> while in a State of Unbelief; &s;o neither can any one be &s;ure of his <HI>Repro|bation,</HI> without knowing he has commit|ted the unpardonable Sin, and is judici|ally harden'd in Impenitency. Now &s;o long as Men have a doctrinal Belief of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and are under the Strivings of the holy Spirit, they may not charge them&s;elves with the unpardonable Sin, and &s;uppo&s;e their ca&s;e de&s;perate: but ought to pre&s;ume upon the Po&s;&s;ibility of their Salvation; and act, in the u&s;e of appointed Means in order to obtain it, with the &s;ame Diligence, as if their Elec|tion were a&s;certain'd to them.</P>
<P>It is nothing le&s;s than <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Folly</HI> for Men to make the Uncertainty of their Election an Argument again&s;t their be|lieving in Chri&s;t; becau&s;e this is acting in Contradiction to the <HI>Command of God,</HI> and to the <HI>Manner of Men,</HI> in all other Ca&s;es of like Uncertainty.</P>
<P>God has <HI>connected</HI> the Means and the End, in this, as well as other Ca&s;es: and yet in other Ca&s;es, Mankind make u&s;e of the <HI>Means,</HI> tho' altogether uncertain of the <HI>Ends,</HI> which is not in their own power, but in the hand of God alone, who&s;e Coun&s;els and De&s;igns are &s;ecret to

<PB N="15" REF="003281_0017_0FF03D39A4712D88">
the Uncertainty of their being elected is rather an Argument for, than again&s;t their labouring to get Faith, and trying to come to Chri&s;t; that &s;o a Ca&s;e of &s;uch in|finite Importance may be re&s;olv'd and put out of all doubt with them. To act otherwi&s;e mu&s;t needs be the height of Folly.</P>
<P>And it is al&s;o heinous <HI>Sin,</HI> in that it vio|lates the Command of God, which requires of all Men a Care to believe in Chri&s;t; and in that it calls God a liar, by di&s;|puting his Sincerity in the Go&s;pel-Invi|tation, which makes the Conditional Offer of Chri&s;t and Life unto all.</P>
<P>In a word, it's not the undi&s;cover'd De|cree, but the reveal'd Precept, that is our Rule, according to which we are to conduct our &s;elves, and by which we &s;hall finally be judg'd. Deut. 29.29. <HI>Secret things belong unto the Lord, our God: but tho&s;e things which are revealed, belong unto us, and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.</HI></P>
<P>It's a bold Intruding into the &s;ecret Coun&s;els of Heaven, to conclude po&s;itive|ly on our being out of the Decree of Sal|vation. Since we are left in Ignorance of the Decree; this will render Go&s;pel-Im|penitents utterly inexcu&s;able: Fora&s;much

&s;hould put a Con&s;traint on Men, to rebel again&s;t his own Authority, and di&s;honour his own Name, and reject his own Son! Our Saviour a&s;&s;igns it as the Rea&s;on, why the <HI>Jews</HI> believed not on him, Joh. 12.39, 40. <HI>Therefore thy could not be|lieve, becau&s;e that</HI> E&s;aias <HI>&s;aid again, He hath blinded their eyes, and hardned their heart; that they &s;hould not &s;ee with their eyes, nor under&s;tand with their heart, and be converted, and I &s;hould heal them.</HI> But we are to under&s;tand this only of a Ne|gative Obduration; not of any actual Infu&s;ion of vicious malignant Qualities, but a meer Su&s;pen&s;ion of divine benign Influences. Nothing is meant, which can imply that God compell'd them to reject Chri&s;t.

<P><PB N="18" REF="003281_0020_0FF03D132046A260">The ble&s;&s;ed God is &s;o far from hard|ning Men's Hearts, in any direct way, &amp; pu&s;hing them forward to De&s;truction; that on the contrary, he employs a Variety of excellent Means which have a Tendency to bring them to Repentance, and pro|mote their Salvation. He actually does all that for them, which it could rationally be expected a wi&s;e Governour &s;hould do, to bring rea&s;onable Creatures to their Duty. He omits nothing proper to be done in the way of Means; and con&s;ider'd in the order of Means they are &s;uch as are every way &s;utable and &s;ufficient.

&s;acred Writings reveal to us the whole Coun&s;el of God, nece&s;&s;ary to be known, concerning fallen Man's Redemption by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. They di&s;cover to us the whole Duty of apo&s;tate Man. They call upon Sinners to repent of Sin, and be|lieve in Chri&s;t, and &s;et before them the &s;tronge&s;t Motives to excite 'em thereto; expo&s;tulating with them, from the ab&s;o|lute need they &s;tand in of a Saviour; from the perfect Sufficiency and Divine Appointment of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to &s;ave unto the uttermo&s;t all that come to God by him; from the infinite Advantages of an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, and the aggravated Damnation they will expo&s;e them&s;elves to by rejecting him.

<P>Let it further be ob&s;erv'd, God has &s;et in his Church <HI>Pa&s;tors &amp; Teachers,</HI> who are to give them&s;elves continually unto Prayer and to the Mini&s;try of the Word; to &s;ound the Calls and Coun&s;els of God in the Ears of Sinners, and to pray over them; if by any means they may melt their

<P>In fine, God gives them his Sabbaths; &s;ets his Sanctuary in the mid&s;t of them; reveals his Covenant, and gives them the Seals appointed as Helps of Faith.</P>
<P>So that they have all done for them that can rea&s;onably be expected God &s;hould do for &s;uch Creatures. He treats them as rational Agents, capable of deliberat|ing, chu&s;ing and re&s;olving. He affords the be&s;t Means to enlighten their under|&s;tandings, direct their Judgments, per|&s;uade their Wills, and move their Affe|ctions, in a rational and moral way. God is repre&s;ented, as <HI>drawing them with the cords of a man,</HI> Ho&s;. 11.4. He u&s;es all the Methods proper to work upon Men, and reclaim rea&s;onable Creatures from their Sins. Hence when Sinners baffle the&s;e Me|thods of Grace, God is repre&s;ented as at a Stand, &amp; &s;eeming not to know what further Cour&s;e could be taken. Ho&s;. 6.4. <HI>O Ephraim, what &s;hall I do unto thee? O Judah, what &s;hall I do unto thee? for your goodne&s;s is as a morning-cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the whole then it appears, if Men peri&s;h from under the Go&s;pel, it can't be imputed to any Defect of pro|per Means on God's part; but to their

own Stubborne&s;s and Ob&s;tinacy. They had a Price in their Hands to get Wi&s;|dom, but had no Heart unto it. It is &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify God, and acquit him of their De&s;truction, That he dealt with them as with rational Creatures, Cau&s;es by Coun&s;el of their own Actions; and u&s;ed Methods of Teaching and Per&s;ua|&s;ion, and all proper external Means, to work upon them, in a way &s;utable to then Nature as Men. &mdash; But it may &s;erve as a further Vindication of the Divine Proceedings, to ob&s;erve,</P>

<P>It mu&s;t be conceded here, That the be&s;t Means God affords any, are not in <HI>them&s;elves alone</HI> &s;ufficient to per&s;uade and enable Sinners to repent and believe: but they depend upon the concurrent Influ|ences of the Spirit of God, to give them &s;uch Efficacy as &s;hall reach the de&s;ired End. 1 Cor. 3.7. <HI>So then, neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth: but God that giveth the increa&s;e.</HI></P>

imagine that God did as much for <HI>Judas,</HI> as he did for <HI>Peter,</HI> to &s;ave his Soul, is the ab&s;urde&s;t Dream in the World. And to &s;ay, that God ab&s;olutely&punc; does all that he can to bring any Go&s;pel-Sinners to repen|tance, who finally peri&s;h, is to a&s;&s;ert the greate&s;t Contradiction. For are not all Things po&s;&s;ible with God? And has he not the Hearts of all Men in his hand, to turn them as he plea&s;eth? Who then can re&s;i&s;t his Effective Will, where he in|tends, and exerts the Strength of his Grace, to convert Men?

<P>But this notwith&s;tanding, Go&s;pel-Im|penitents are inexcu&s;able, and cannot plead a want of nece&s;&s;ary internal Aids of Divine Grace, as affording them any Cloke for their Sin. For let it be re|mark'd in two or three particulars,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Sinners do not reali&s;e</HI> what God tells them of the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of his Grace, and of their own <HI>Impotency,</HI> but are apt vain|ly to <HI>magnify their own Abilities,</HI> and to think every man of him&s;elf more highly than he ought to think. They particu|larly claim &s;uch a &s;elf-determining Pow|er, and Liberty of Will in matters &s;piri|tual,
<PB N="24" REF="003281_0026_0FF03D1B01049EC0">
as &s;uper&s;edes the Nece&s;&s;ity of any immediate Energy of the holy Spirit to work in them to will and to do. They a&s;cribe a great deal too much of Power to moral Sua&s;ion; and think that &s;uffici|ent, without any renewing Change on the Heart by the immediate Influence of the holy Spirit, to produce Repentance towards God, and Faith in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Job 11.12. <HI>For vain man would be wi&s;e, though man be born like a wild a&s;&s;es colt.</HI> Pride makes men conceited of them|&s;elves, and loth to &s;ee how vile and un|worthy and helple&s;s they are in them|&s;elves; and loth to be beholden to Divine Grace. It makes men imagine, They have a Stock of their own to live upon. Their haughty &s;pirits can't &s;toop to own Repentance is the gift of God, or that God gives men to believe, any other|wi&s;e than in a way of moral Sua&s;ion. And now it is a righteous Thing in God to deal with Sinners according to their own Pre&s;umption in this matter; and deny 'em that &s;pecial Grace, which they think they have no need of: be &s;ure he's ju&s;t in charging that Unbelief as wilful, which they think it in their own power to help. It is a remarkable pa&s;&s;age, that of our Saviour to the proud &s;elf-&s;ufficient Pha|ri&s;ees,
<PB N="25" REF="003281_0027_0FF03D42D1196930">
Joh. 9.41. <HI>Je&s;us &s;aid unto them, If ye were blind, ye &s;hould have no &s;in: but now ye &s;ay, We &s;ee; your &s;in remaineth.</HI> If Sinners have not an Opinion of them|&s;elves, that they are blind, and impotent, and dead in Sins, and yet reject Chri&s;t; their Sin is the more aggravated, and God may ju&s;tly with-hold that Grace from them which they have &s;o little &s;en&s;e of their need of, and from the Honour of which they &s;o detract by a vainglo|rious Apprehen&s;ion of their own Abilities. They oppo&s;e, they decry the Doctrine of &s;pecial Grace, and God in his un&s;potted Ju&s;tice leaves them de&s;titute of it. "No men do &s;hew le&s;s of a free-will to all &s;piri|tual Good, than the men who have been the great A&s;&s;ertors and Admirers of man's free Will: In their own Practice they confute their Opinion; at lea&s;t render them&s;elves of all men the mo&s;t <HI>inexcu&s;able".</HI> Surely this is enough to &s;top their Mouths, that they cannot throw any blame on God.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Sinners don't pray to God for his Spi|rit as they ought,</HI> altho' they confe&s;s their own Impotency. They know that God expects to be &s;ought to for all needed Ble&s;&s;ings, and in &s;pecial for that Ble&s;&s;ing of Ble&s;&s;ings, the &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ing: Ne|verthele&s;s they call not upon God; or

if at all, yet &s;eldom and with a great deal of Coldne&s;s and Indifference. They &s;et upon Duty in their own &s;trength, and attend Ordinances in a prayerle&s;s carele&s;s frame, not looking to God for that Grace to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, without which they can do nothing, and without which the be&s;t means will be in&s;ignificant. We read, P&s;al. 10.4. <HI>The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not &s;eek after God: God is not in his thoughts.</HI> It may be, they are in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;en&s;ible of their own Impotence, of the In&s;ufficiency of moral Sua&s;ion alone, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;u|pernatural Grace; yet they don't apply them&s;elves to <HI>Prayer,</HI> as becomes them in order to obtain Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tances in Duty, and a Divine Ble&s;&s;ing on external Means.</P>
<P>Some Sinners, when call'd upon to turn and live, will object their own In|ability, &amp; plead, <HI>I can do nothing: God mu&s;t do all.</HI> And this they commonly &s;eem to &s;peak with a trifling &s;pirit, and profane Ea&s;ine&s;s, as if their own Impotence ex|cus'd them from all Care and Concern about the matter; neither do's it put 'em upon <HI>praying,</HI> as it rationally might be ex|pected. Methinks Sinners &s;hould reflect on their own Inability, with a deep &s;elf-abhorrence, and with great Di&s;tre&s;s of
<PB N="27" REF="003281_0029_0FF03D4547529688">
Soul, with Angui&s;h, and with many Tears and Fears. Methinks the &s;en&s;e of their own Impotence &s;hould put them upon crying earne&s;tly to God, as he, Jer. 31.28. <HI>Turn thou me, and I &s;hall be turned.</HI> Neverthe|le&s;s how many Sinners live without Pray|er, or do not call upon God with any Care of Importunity!</P>
<P>It may be they plead, <HI>They cannot pray.</HI> But then it mu&s;t be &s;aid, they don't <HI>&s;tir up them&s;elves</HI> to call upon God. They indulge a Spirit of carnal Security. They neither take pains with their Hearts to get them into a praying frame, nor do they with a ju&s;t Concern and Anxiety of Mind beg of God to teach and help them to pray. God has re&s;erv'd a peculiar A|gency to him&s;elf, even in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Prayer: and he does as much command our Application to him for his A&s;&s;i&s;tance in this Duty of Prayer, as he does demand the Re&s;t of the Duty. And yet Sinners will not apply to the Throne of Grace, that they may obtain Mercy, and find Grace to help them. Surely &s;uch are left without all Excu&s;e. They have no Cloke for their Sin. No Rock can hide them.</P>
<P>It may be, &s;ome will plead; They have not &s;ufficient <HI>Encouragement</HI> to pray for and &s;eek converting Grace: becau&s;e there's
<PB N="28" REF="003281_0030_0FF03D1ECE7DF9E8">
no po&s;itive <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> for a Sinner to depend upon. But &s;urely the Calls and Invitati|ons of the Go&s;pel afford &s;ufficient War|rant, and are an encouraging Ground of Faith &amp; Hope. &mdash; Many have ventur'd upon this Foundation of a rational <HI>Pro|bability</HI>; and have &s;ucceeded. &mdash; And then you have as much Ground for Hope here, as in many other Ca&s;es; where yet, while you u&s;e the Means, you depend upon a Ble&s;&s;ing.

<P>We will not di&s;pute this Principle, that the Prayers of unregenerate Sinners don't intitle them to the Gift of the holy Spirit, by virtue of any <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> God has made to them: But allow he is &s;till at Liberty, and may in his holy Sovereignty deny &s;pecial Grace to them. Hear how the Apo&s;tle treats this critical Ca&s;e, and let us &s;et down by his Re&s;olution, Rom. 9.14, 15, 16. <HI>What &s;hall we then &s;ay? Is there unrighteou&s;ne&s;s with God? God forbid. For he &s;aith to</HI> Mo&s;es, <HI>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compa&s;&s;ion on whom I will have compa&s;&s;ion.

So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that &s;heweth mercy.</HI> It follows, ver. 19, 20, &amp; 21. <HI>Thou wilt then &s;ay unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? for who hath re&s;i&s;ted his will? Nay, but O man, who art thou that replie&s;t again&s;t God? &s;hall the thing formed &s;ay to him that form|ed it, Why ha&s;t thou made me thus? Hath not the Potter power over the clay, of the &s;ame lump to make one ve&s;&s;el unto honour, and a|nother unto di&s;honour</HI>? The meer Plea&s;ure of God determines who &s;hall and who &s;hall not obtain &s;pecial Grace. Yet this is &s;o far from being a Plea to excu&s;e any from praying for converting Grace, that it is rather an Argument why they &s;hould pray for it. Becau&s;e, if their obtaining &s;pecial Grace depends on the meer Plea&s;ure of God, their <HI>Unworthine&s;s</HI> will not be an <HI>Impedi|ment</HI> in the way, neither &s;hould it <HI>di&s;|courage</HI> them, that they can find no Rea|&s;on or Motive in <HI>them&s;elves</HI> of God's Love. They are as <HI>capable</HI> of being lov'd by him, and as capable to be the object of his &s;pe|cial Ble&s;&s;ing, as any in the World. There's nothing <HI>in them</HI> that can <HI>hinder</HI> a gracious God from &s;etting his Heart upon them: and <HI>for ought they know,</HI> it may be his good plea&s;ure to ble&s;s them. This is the &s;ame encouragement as they act upon in

other ca&s;es: and if they will not venture upon &s;uch Encouragement in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, they mu&s;t needs be left inexcu&s;able, and condemn'd as acting a mo&s;t incon|&s;i&s;tent part. Ye Hypocrites, how is it that you can di&s;cern the face of the Sky, and of the Earth; and when God with-holds the Rain of Heaven, you can howl upon your Beds, and a&s;&s;emble your &s;elves to cry unto him for Corn &amp; Wine, though you have no a&s;&s;urance to be heard!

<P>Let it be added,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Sinners under the Go&s;pel, whether they pray for the Spirit or not, do actually</HI> ex|perience <HI>tho&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tances of common Grace, which are a full Vindication of God, and leave them without all Excu&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>He not only u&s;es all proper Methods with them in the way of external Means; but he affords them &s;uch internal A&s;&s;i&s;t|ances, by his holy Spirit, as &s;erve to leave them without any Cloke for their Sin.

So that they forfeited all Right to the (&s;uppos'd) Promi&s;e of &s;pe|cial Grace, and God appears infinitely ju&s;t in taking his holy Spirit from 'em, and &s;ealing their Damnation.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it's evident from what has been &s;aid, that God does all that be|comes a <HI>wi&s;e</HI> Sovereign to do, both in an external and internal way, to reclaim Sin|ners: and it may be added, He is <HI>long-&s;uffering</HI> towards them as a <HI>merciful</HI> Sove|reign. It is &s;aid, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.9. <HI>The Lord is long-&s;uffering to us-ward, not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but that all &s;hould come to repentance.</HI> So we read, 1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 4.3. <HI>This
<PB N="33" REF="003281_0035_0FF03D4C263DF678">
is the will of God, even your Sanctification.</HI> This is his commanding and approving Will, and the plain Language of his Con|duct towards Sinners. He <HI>commands</HI> all Men every where to repent; he gives them a <HI>Space</HI> to repent; and waits long upon them. He does not in&s;tantly let fly the Arrows of Vengeance, and upon the fir&s;t Provocation ca&s;t them off for ever: but he continues driving with 'em by his Spirit, and repeating the Go&s;pel-Call, giving them Line upon Line, Pre|cept upon Precept, from one time to ano|ther; and this it may be for a long Cour&s;e of years. So that none among all them which peri&s;h from under Go&s;pel-Light, will have it to complain of God, that he de|ny'd them &s;ufficient Opportunity, or was not willing that they &s;hould come to Re|pentance and be &s;aved. But they mu&s;t take all the Blame to them&s;elves; as having trifled away the precious <HI>Sea&s;ons</HI> of Mercy allow'd them; as having re&s;i&s;ted God, &amp; defeated all the <HI>Methods</HI> of Grace to &s;ave them; led on by the Lu&s;ts of a carnal Mind, that is Enmity again&s;t God, and full of Prejudices again&s;t the Redeemer &amp; his Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>

<P>I come now to the next Thing,</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>THAT Sinners have no Cloke for their Sin, from any Pleas they can make referring to SATAN, and an evil WORLD, their &s;piritual Ad|ver&s;aries.</HI></P>
<P>They &s;uffer no Violence from external Cau&s;es, nor will any Impediments they meet with in the Way of Duty, afford 'em a Plea &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify their not repent|ing and receiving Chri&s;t. <HI>What</HI> or <HI>who</HI> &s;hould compel the Sinner to refu&s;e Chri&s;t? Who &s;hould put a Force upon him to go on in his Sins, and reject Chri&s;t, again&s;t all the Calls and Attractions of the Go&s;pel? I have &s;hew'd, it can't be imagin'd that the Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>God</HI> &s;hould put Sinners under any Con&s;traint &s;o to do; which would be to oblige them to rebel again&s;t his own Au|thority, and di&s;honour his own Name, to trample on his dear Son, &amp; de&s;pi&s;e the great Salvation, that he has been at an infinite

Expence to purcha&s;e for us. Nor can it be &s;aid that any <HI>Creature</HI> puts a Force upon 'em. Surely not this <HI>Evil World,</HI> whether the Things, or the Men of it. The <HI>Things</HI> of the World have a tempting Influence, but carry nothing of Compul&s;ion in 'em, to bring us into Captivity to Sin. So the <HI>Men</HI> of the World, they may per&s;uade and intice, but they cannot force. They may indeed u&s;e a Violence upon the Bo|dy, and hinder that from external Duties; but they can't reach the Soul, to hinder this from the invi&s;ible Actings of Repent|ance toward God, and Faith in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Who then &s;hould be the Author of this pretended Violence?</P>
<P>Will it be attributed to the <HI>Devil?</HI> True, he is our grand Adver&s;ary, and he goeth about as a roaring Lion, &s;eeking whom he may devour: He's a mo&s;t powerful and malicious Enemy. But yet his <HI>Strength</HI> lies chiefly in his <HI>Policy</HI> and Skill in the Arts of Deceiving. He is more &s;ubtil to delude, than powerful to con&s;train. What <HI>Force</HI> can <HI>he</HI> u&s;e? Does the Devil by any &s;ecret irre&s;i&s;tible Efficacy bind and com|pel Men to act in Contradiction to their own real Judgment and Choice? No ve|rily: he can intice and decoy, affright and terrify; but not compel and oblige.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="003281_0041_0FF03D5338E3A8E0">When Men for&s;ake Chri&s;t, is it the <HI>Devil</HI> (think you) that draggs them a|way from him by Force! Does the Devil chain their Feet, that they cannot go to the Hou&s;e of God, to &s;eek Chri&s;t in his Or|dinances! Does the Devil &s;top their mouths, and make them re&s;train Prayer before God! Does the Devil &s;hut their Ears, that they cannot hear; and clo&s;e their Eyes, that they cannot read the Word of Salvation! Does the Devil harden their Hearts and &s;ear their Con&s;ciences, that they &s;hould not be affected and con&s;ider the Things which belong to their everla&s;ting Peace? Does the Devil enrage Men's Pa&s;&s;ions, when at any time they are full of Cla|mour and evil-&s;peaking! Does the Devil move Men's Tongues when they throw out their Bla&s;phemies and horrid Oaths! Or does he open the Drunkards Mouths, when they take down their intemperate and &s;tupifying Cups!</P>
<P>What <HI>Violence</HI> (I pray) does Satan u&s;e in any of the&s;e Ca&s;es! 'Tis true, he's a Tempter to all Wickedne&s;s, and Enemy of all Righteou&s;ne&s;s; a cunning, a &s;trong, and bui&s;y Adver&s;ary. He has many Wiles to de&s;troy the Souls of Men: He often impo&s;es upon them by fal&s;e Rea&s;onings, and by deceitful Baits draws them into a
<PB N="40" REF="003281_0042_0FF03D2DBAE30AF0">
Snare and Death. He is very &s;ubtil to ca&s;t in Objections and rai&s;e Prejudices in Men's Minds again&s;t the Truths &amp; Ways of God; He is &s;ubtil to repre&s;ent Sin and Error in a plau&s;ible Dre&s;s, in very fair and alluring Colours; He has al&s;o a great Sagacity and Dexterity in applying his Temptations, to &s;ute the various Tempers of Per&s;ons, to hit the Opportunity, &amp; take all Advantages. And he's very indu&s;tri|ous, even indefatigable, in his Efforts to hinder Men from entertaining the Go&s;pel, and keep them &s;till in their Sins. But when he has done all, he can't compel Men again&s;t their Wills. Let no man, when he is tempted, &s;ay he's compel'd by the Devil: for Satan's power is not com|pul&s;ive, but per&s;ua&s;ive only. He may per&s;uade the judgment by delu&s;ive Argu|ings, but he cannot force the Will, again&s;t the Judgment. He has no Power but what is re&s;i&s;tible. Hence that, Jam. 4.7. <HI>Re&s;i&s;t the Devil, and he &s;hall flee from you.</HI></P>
<P>But 'tis the Fault and Folly of Sinners, They <HI>don't</HI> re&s;i&s;t the Devil. They don't &s;tudy his Devices, and watch his Motions, and oppo&s;e his Attempts, as they ought to do. Which certainly mu&s;t needs make them inexcu&s;able, and &s;top their Mouths from pleading the Power of Satan over
<PB N="41" REF="003281_0043_0FF03D56543A9E90">
them in Apology for their Sin and Impe|nitence.</P>
<P>And then, it mu&s;t be con&s;ider'd, if Sa|tan has gain'd a Power over any, which &s;eems almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible, &s;o that they are (as it is &s;aid, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.26.) <HI>Led captive by him at his will</HI>; they have bro't this upon them&s;elves. The natural Power, or the Power which Satan has over Men by Nature, they may be &s;aid to have brought it upon them&s;elves by their Sin and Fall in <HI>Adam,</HI> their primitive Head and Repre&s;entative: But more e&s;pecially the <HI>heighten'd Degree</HI> of this Power, may Sinners be &s;aid to bring them&s;elves under, by giving <HI>Place to the Devil,</HI> by yielding to his Temptations, and <HI>doing his Lu&s;ts</HI> from time to time. Thus he gets an Advantage again&s;t them, and acquires to him&s;elf a new Degree of Power over them. This is the <HI>natural</HI> Effect: &s;ince every act of Sin &s;trengthens the Habit within Men; and the &s;tronger the Habit of Sin is, the more Power Satan has over them; for he rules them by the Mediation of their own Lu&s;ts and Corruptions. And then it is the <HI>moral</HI> Effect of the Sinners Conduct, by provoking God judicially to abandon them, and &s;uffer Satan to exerci&s;e a &s;pi|ritual Tyranny over them. That is the
<PB N="42" REF="003281_0044_0FF03D2FF9635478">
Ca&s;e of &s;ome for&s;aken Sinners, 2 Pet. 2.14. <HI>They cannot cea&s;e from Sin.</HI> So it is &s;aid, <HI>Jer.</HI> 13.23. <HI>Can the Ethiopian change his Skin, or the leopard his &s;pots? then may ye al&s;o do good, that are accu&s;tomed to do evil.</HI> Now the grand Rea&s;on of this their Impo|tence is the power and working of Satan in them, which ob&s;tructs the Efficacy of the Means of Grace employ'd upon 'em. The Apo&s;tle re&s;olves all into this, 2 Cor. 4.4. <HI>In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, le&s;t the light of the glorious Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, who is the image of God, &s;hould &s;hine unto them.</HI></P>
<P>But then is this any <HI>Excu&s;e,</HI> pleadable by Sinners in Vindication of their Unbe|lief and Impenitence? No; for had they not fir&s;t re&s;i&s;ted God &s;o ob&s;tinately, &s;o perver&s;ely, He had not abandon'd 'em: but &s;ince they have for&s;aken him, he may ju&s;tly for&s;ake them, and leave 'em to the the Power of Satan. Hence that account is given of the matter, P&s;al. 81.11, 12. <HI>My People would not hearken to my Voice; and I&s;rael would none of me: SO I gave them up.</HI> And therefore they mu&s;t needs be inex|cu&s;able. The Power, which Satan has over them, affords no Cloke for their Sin: becau&s;e they have brought this great
<PB N="43" REF="003281_0045_0FF03D57D799CF20">
Evil upon them&s;elves, both by the ju&s;t De|&s;ert, and by the natural Efficacy of their guilty and fooli&s;h Submi&s;&s;ions to the Tempter, again&s;t all the Force of Divine Warnings and Re&s;traints, from time to time. Is not he ju&s;tly reputed a &s;elf-de|&s;troyer, that runs into the mouth of this devouring Lion; that has no Care to e&s;|cape, nor takes any Pains in re&s;i&s;ting him: but heedle&s;ly and pre&s;umptuou&s;ly goes in the Paths of the De&s;troyer, expo&s;ing him|&s;elf for an ea&s;y Prey to &s;o wily and powerful an Adver&s;ary! Our Mother <HI>Eve</HI> wou'd fain have laid the Blame of her Fall upon Satan: &s;ays &s;he, <HI>The Serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.</HI> But it was a poor Excu&s;e, and of no Avail. Neither will the like Pretence be of any &s;ignifi|cance in the mouth of her Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall not enlarge any further here. We come now to the la&s;t Thing:</P>
<P>PROP. III. <HI>IT remains therefore, that Sin|ners take all the Blame of their Sin and Ruin to THEMSELVES.</HI></P>
<P>The Devil and his In&s;truments may lay Temptations before Men, and &s;o be acce&s;&s;ory to their Sinning: but 'tis their own evil Heart, that deceives and car|carries
<PB N="44" REF="003281_0046_0FF03D3251B5A160">
them on to comply, and is the prin|cipal Cau&s;e of their Sin &amp; Ruin. Hence that, <HI>Jam.</HI> 1.14. 'Every Man is tempted, when he is enticed and drawn away of <HI>his own Lu&s;ts.</HI> It is the carnal and re|bellious Principle, &s;o deeply rooted in our degenerate Nature, that draws Men from Chri&s;t, &s;educes them from Duty, and makes them to pervert the right ways of the Lord. It is <HI>their own Lu&s;t,</HI> that fills them with Prejudices again&s;t Chri&s;t, and the way of Salvation by him. It is <HI>their own Lu&s;t,</HI> that hinders them from &s;ub|mitting to Chri&s;t, as the Lord their Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s. 'Tis <HI>their own Lu&s;t,</HI> that hin|ders them from confe&s;&s;ing their Sins, and repenting, to give Glory to God. It is <HI>their own Lu&s;t,</HI> that hinders them from attending, with a &s;utable Concern and Diligence, on the Word and Means of Grace. 'Tis <HI>their own Lu&s;t,</HI> that prevents their getting the Good of Ordinances and Providences; that gives the Efficacy to Temptations, and makes Satan &s;o &s;ucce&s;s|ful in his malicious E&s;&s;ays again&s;t them. It's all owing to the Lu&s;ts of Men's own Hearts. That's the Cen&s;ure upon them, 2 Tim. 3.6. <HI>Led away with divers Lu&s;ts.</HI> And the&s;e are repre&s;ented as <HI>fooli&s;h</HI> and <HI>hurtful</HI> Lu&s;ts, which drown Men in De|&s;truction

and Perdition, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.9. Our Saviour has told us, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.19. <HI>And this is the Condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e their deeds were evil.</HI></P>
<P>But for the clearer Illu&s;tration of the Point, I &s;hall pur&s;ue it, in three or four particulars, as briefly as I can, with Ju&s;tice to &s;o important a Subject.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let it be con&s;ider'd, <HI>Go&s;pel-Impeni|tents do very much</HI> neglect <HI>to u&s;e, or</HI> trifle <HI>in u&s;ing, tho&s;e</HI> Means, <HI>which are in their own power, and which they might probably hope God would ble&s;s, in order to their Con|ver&s;ion and Salvatian.</HI></P>
<P>Altho' it is true, that Sinners can't by any innate Power of their own convert them&s;elves: Yet they can by the help of common Grace attend, with &s;ome mea|&s;ure of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and a moral Sincerity, on the Means of Divine Appointment; and in this way they might do a great deal more toward their Conver&s;ion than they actually do. Notwith&s;tanding that in the moment of Regeneration we are properly pa&s;&s;ive, and the whole Efficien|cy is of God: Yet in order to God's per|forming this good work upon us, he re|quires us to be diligently attending on his holy Ordinances; which are the u&s;ual
<PB N="46" REF="003281_0048_0FF03D5D5E8FE210">
Vehicles of &s;aving Grace, and we can't rationally expert the &s;anctifying Opera|tions of the holy Spirit upon our Souls, but in the way of Duty. To &s;it &s;till, in|tirely negligent of our &s;piritual Concerns, and yet expect the &s;pecial Influences of Divine Grace, is wicked and dangerous Pre&s;umption. Hence we are frequently call'd upon in &s;uch terms as tho&s;e, Joh. 6.27. <HI>Labour for the meat, which endureth to Everla&s;ting Life.</HI> And <HI>Luke</HI> 13.24. <HI>Strive to enter in at the &s;trait Gate.</HI> So Phil. 2.12. <HI>Work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling.</HI> And when Sinners are neg|lective &amp; &s;lothful, God complains of 'em, as in Ho&s;. 5.4. <HI>They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God.</HI> So the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t reproved the Jews of his day in that Language, <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.40. <HI>And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</HI> The&s;e are Complaints lying again&s;t Multitudes of Profe&s;&s;ors un|der the Go&s;pel: and indeed all that fi|nally peri&s;h, will fall under the Reproach of the&s;e heavy Imputations. This will be their Condemnation at la&s;t, that when they enjoy'd, or had Opportunity to en|joy the Means of Grace, they neglected the &s;ame. Not indeed that all who pe|ri&s;h, will be &s;ound guilty of an intire and
<PB N="47" REF="003281_0049_0FF03D840CD78960">
univer&s;al Neglect: for &s;ome may give their Attendance on the&s;e and tho&s;e Du|ties, but then they neglect others, and are very formal in all. But the Gene|rality will be found to have been gro&s;ly negligent of the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary in&s;trumen|tal Duties of Religion, and will be found to have habitually trifled in them.</P>
<P>Now if they would not do what was in their power to do, in order to Salvation, no wonder if they peri&s;h: they peri&s;h very ju&s;tly. Some of Solomon's Ob&s;ervations may be pertinently enough apply'd in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e: <HI>Prov.</HI> 13.4. <HI>The &s;oul of the &s;luggard de&s;ireth, and hath nothing.</HI> Chap. 21.25. <HI>The de&s;ire of the &s;lothful killeth him, for his hands refu&s;e to la|bour.</HI> If men are guilty of inexcu|&s;able Folly, who neglect the Bu&s;ine&s;s of common Life, and complain of Want: how much more they, who neglect their Souls and the great Salvation! <HI>O how &s;hall &s;uch e&s;cape?</HI> And are not many Sinners condemned of them&s;elves, by their own practice with relation to worldly Concerns! <HI>For no man ever yet hated his own Body, but nouri&s;heth and cheri&s;heth it.</HI> And will you &s;tarve your <HI>Souls</HI> to Death!

<P>Now, if this be the Conduct of Sin|ners, while they continue impenitent, 'tis &s;urely a vain thing for them to go about to excu&s;e them&s;elves with any Plea from their &s;piritual Impotence.

It's a vanity for Sinners to complain of Weakne&s;s and Inability, that don't do what is in their power as to the <HI>material</HI> part of Duty.

their Mouths, and render their ca&s;e utterly indefen&s;ible; For this certainly argues a <HI>Want</HI> of <HI>Will</HI> to come to Chri&s;t and turn to God.

<P>Ob&s;erve; This coming to Chri&s;t and turning to God may be taken two ways; either in a divided Sen&s;e for the <HI>Acts</HI> of believing and repenting, or in a com|pounded &s;en&s;e for the <HI>U&s;e of Means</HI> and <HI>Endeavours</HI> to obtain Faith and Repent|ance.

<PB N="52" REF="003281_0054_0FF03D65EA790818">
rather than Incapacity. 'Tis a cho&s;en and delightful Impotence. 'Tis owing to the Malignity of their corrupt <HI>Wills,</HI> that they cannot repent and con|vert to God. As it is &s;aid, <HI>Jer.</HI> 6.10. <HI>Behold, their Ear is uncircumci&s;ed, and they cannot hearken.</HI></P>

They re&s;i&s;t his holy Moti|ons, &s;tifle Convictions, and do what they can to efface any good Impre&s;&s;ions begun upon them. They often quench the Spi|rit, by one unhappy Means &amp; another, by Sloth &amp; Carele&s;sne&s;s, by Pride and Self-Confidence, by Impatience, &amp; De&s;|pondence, by worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s or &s;en&s;u|al Diver&s;ions, by affected Ignorance, by &s;tudy'd Excu&s;es, Delays, and the like. Thus they fru&s;trate the &s;triving Spirit of God, and receive his Grace in vain. So they fail of a &s;aving Conver&s;ion, by their own wilful Folly: and &s;uch as reject the Means, may be &s;aid wilfully to refu&s;e the End. Surely then in this regard Go&s;pel-Sinners are without Excu&s;e, and have no Cloke for their Sin.</P>
<P>Let it now be added,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Go&s;pel-Impenitents do actually commit tho&s;e</HI> Sins, <HI>which as they have a natural Ten|dency to hinder their Conver&s;ion, &s;o they pro|voke

<P>Sinners might, if they would, by the help of common Grace, reform their evil Manners, purge their Lives from gro&s;s Enormities, and lay con&s;iderable Re&s;traints on the Lu&s;ts and Pa&s;&s;ions of their evil Hearts. They might, if they would, forbear the outward Act of gro&s;s Sins. They might avoid the occa&s;ions of Sin|ning, and &s;hun Temptations, more than they do. They could argue with them|&s;elves the Folly of their Vices, &amp; Danger of Impenitence: They could bind their Souls in &s;erious Vows and Re&s;olutions; which might be good Pre&s;ervatives and Guards again&s;t their returning unto Folly, the Folly of &s;candalous Practice.</P>
<P>What &s;hould hinder Sinners from u&s;ing the&s;e Methods in order to break off their &s;ins!

<P>Now all this are Go&s;pel-Sinners warn|ed of: and yet they go on in their Sins, to add Iniquity to Rebellion, Ob&s;tinacy to Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. They multiply their Sins, and proceed from Evil to Evil, crucifying to them&s;elves the Son of God afre&s;h: tho' they know how they hereby expo&s;e them&s;elves to the Lo&s;s of the &s;triving Spirit of Grace.

<P>Now upon the whole, let it be con&s;i|der'd,</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Go&s;pel-Sinners do all this in a</HI> free <HI>and</HI> voluntary <HI>manner, and upon</HI> Motives <HI>which at the time appear to them founded in Rea&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>That they do act freely, is a nece&s;&s;ary Deduction from tho&s;e Scriptures, that &s;peak of Men's Unbelief as a <HI>Refu&s;ing</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and of their Impenitence as an <HI>hardning of their Hearts</HI>; which implies an Exerci&s;e of the <HI>Will.</HI> And the Infe|rence as confirm'd by tho&s;e Scriptures, that charge this Unbelief and Impeni|tence as a <HI>Guilt</HI> upon us; which implies that we are under no phy&s;ical Coaction, or ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of Nature: For if &s;o, how then would our refu&s;ing of Chri&s;t be a Sin!</P>
<P>For the clearing this point, it may be ob&s;erv'd, Notwith&s;tanding the moral <HI>Sla|very</HI> Men are under to the Fle&s;h, World, and Devil, who rule in the hearts of the Children of Di&s;obedience; yet they &s;till retain that Liberty of Will, which is e&s;|&s;ential to them <HI>as Men,</HI> and renders 'em
<PB N="58" REF="003281_0060_0FF03D6C1740F508">
capable Subjects of moral Government. We &s;till retain all the e&s;&s;ential Powers of Men; tho' the original Rectitude of them is lo&s;t. Our Actions are &s;till under the Conduct of our internal powers of Un|der&s;tanding and Will. And the Will in us is yet a <HI>rational</HI> Faculty; <HI>i. e.</HI> Con|ducted by the Under&s;tanding and Judg|ment: and acts upon &s;ome Motives that at pre&s;ent &s;eem to carry Rea&s;on &amp; Force with them, tho' they often prove upon a &s;tricter Examination of Things, to have little Truth or Weight. However &s;uch is the Con&s;titution of our Nature, even in this fallen State, that the Will follows the Directions of the Under&s;tanding; pur&s;uing what that exhibits as a Good, and declining what that repre&s;ents as an Evil. No man loves or hates, chu&s;es or refu&s;es, but he pretends to do it upon Arguments of Rea&s;on, and has &s;ome <HI>Idea</HI> in his Mind that &s;ways and governs him.</P>
<P>Even thus in the Ca&s;e before us, if Sinners harden their Hearts and refu&s;e Chri&s;t, they do it upon &s;ome Grounds and Con&s;iderations, that in the pre&s;ent View of Things appear to them <HI>rational.</HI> This is repre&s;ented in that Clau&s;e of the Para|ble of the Vineyard, <HI>Luk.</HI> 20.13, 14. <HI>Then &s;aid the Lord of the Vineyard, What &s;hall I
<PB N="59" REF="003281_0061_0FF03D923A17DF38">
do? I will &s;end my beloved Son: it may be they will reverence him when they &s;ee him. But when the husbandmen &s;aw him, they rea&s;oned among them&s;elves, &s;aying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the in|heritance may be ours.</HI> And proceeding thus upon &s;eemingly rational Views, they appear to act with a <HI>freedom of Will</HI> in rejecting Chri&s;t. Which is a Truth that all mu&s;t acknowledge, if they entertain a right Notion of human Liberty.</P>
<P>Now the Liberty of the Will do's not con|&s;i&s;t in an aequilibrious Indifference, a doubt|ful Su&s;pen&s;ion, and equal Inclination to two contrary objects: becau&s;e this wou'd in|fer, That the <HI>more</HI> virtuous or the <HI>more</HI> vicious any are, the <HI>le&s;s</HI> they are &s;o, being the le&s;s <HI>free</HI>; and con&s;equently le&s;s inti|tled to Rewards, or le&s;s expos'd to Pu|ni&s;hments, which belong to free Agents, only in proportion to the Degrees of Virtue or Vice, their Actions carry in them. Human Liberty then cannot lie in an Indifference to Good and Evil: but it is an intelligent Spontaneity, and lies in a Capacity or Propen&s;ity to act according to the pre&s;ent Dictates of the Under&s;tanding. To act freely is to act by a voluntary Motion, agreable to the Re&s;ult of our pre&s;ent Thoughts, without
<PB N="60" REF="003281_0062_0FF03D6FD747E660">
an unnatural Force and irre&s;i&s;tible Com|pul&s;ion from any external Cau&s;e. This kind of Liberty is fundamental to human Nature, and the nece&s;&s;ary Property of moral actions.</P>
<P>Of this meer e&s;&s;ential Liberty of Will even the vile&s;t Sinners are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: and this they exerci&s;e, when they neglect the great Salvation, refu&s;e Chri&s;t, and go on in Sin. They herein act <HI>upon Choice,</HI> and according to their pre&s;ent practical Judg|ment, as intellectual and free Agents.</P>
<P>Indeed the natural man is under a <HI>moral</HI> Impo&s;&s;ibility of determining him&s;elf to that which is &s;piritually good, and has not an actual Freedom of Will to chu&s;e &amp; embrace Chri&s;t. For by the carnal Mind within him, which is full of Prejudices again&s;t Chri&s;t, and repre&s;ents him to the Sinner in a fal&s;e Light, under very odious Cha|racters, the Will is di&s;po&s;ed to avoid and refu&s;e him, and the Soul carry'd out in Acts of Enmity again&s;t him: and &s;o long as the Under&s;tanding remains dark|en'd and depraved, the Will mu&s;t remain unalterably &s;et in oppo&s;ition to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Yet this is not a Nece&s;&s;ity that ex|cu&s;es the Sinner from guilt in refu&s;ing of Chri&s;t; becau&s;e it is &s;uch a Nece&s;&s;ity as is con&s;i&s;tent with a freedom of Action,
<PB N="61" REF="003281_0063_0FF03D955136B918">
and does not imply any external Com|pul&s;ion or Force put upon our Nature.</P>
<P>The Sinner acts with a <HI>full Con&s;ent</HI> of his Will, and with the &s;ame Liberty, as if there were no manner of Nece&s;&s;ity lying upon him. He acts as freely, as if there were no determinate Coun&s;el of God concerning him. He acts as freely, as if there were no governing Providence over him. He acts as freely, as if there were no Devil to tempt him; and as if there were no Impediments in the way to prevent his coming to Chri&s;t. The Sinner is voluntary in his Aver&s;ation from Chri&s;t: and whatever Nece&s;&s;ity he is under, of acting as he does, it is a cho&s;en and plea&s;ing Nece&s;&s;ity, very agreable to his corrupt Nature. It &s;prings from a rooted Principle of Enmity in his heart to Chri&s;t &amp; his Ways, and from a radicated Love to Sin and the World, which he can't &s;ubmit to part with for Chri&s;t's &s;ake. The man is contented with his fallen Condition; he delights in his Chains, and abhors the Terms on which Chri&s;t offers Deliverance to him. He refu&s;es Chri&s;t with a delightful Spontaneity.</P>
<P>So that whether he is &s;uppo&s;ed to be under a moral Nece&s;&s;ity of acting as he does, or to have a Power of acting other|wi&s;e,
<PB N="62" REF="003281_0064_0FF03D715ADD3280">
it makes no Difference; but leaves him equality inexcu&s;able: for if he were under no manner of Nece&s;&s;ity or Infirmi|ty, but had in him&s;elf a &s;ufficient Strength and Ability to come to Chri&s;t and turn from Sin, yet <HI>he would not</HI>; &s;uch is the Malignity of his Will, &s;uch the Pride of his Heart and Stupidity of his Soul. He loves not the Per&s;on of Chri&s;t; he values not his Offices; he inwardly hates the Laws of Chri&s;t, and de&s;pi&s;es his Righteou&s;ne&s;s. We read, Prov. 13.19. <HI>It is Abomination to Fools to depart from Evil.</HI> They hate knowledge, and do not chu&s;e the Fear of the Lord, <HI>Chap.</HI> 1.29. So <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.19. <HI>They love darkne&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.7, 8.&mdash;<HI>Not &s;ubject to the law of God, neither indeed</HI> can <HI>be. So then they that are in the fle&s;h</HI> cannot <HI>plea&s;e God.</HI> The Scripture imputes a kind of moral Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of Sinning as they do, unto Sin|ners in a State of Nature: And yet al&s;o imputes their Sins to their own voluntary Choice. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 66.3. <HI>They have cho&s;en their own ways, and their &s;oul delighteth in their abominations.</HI></P>
<P>Now thus to chu&s;e the ways of Sin, is to chu&s;e <HI>Death</HI> in the Cau&s;es of it. Hence that, <HI>Prov.</HI> 8.36. <HI>But he that &s;inneth again&s;t me, wrongeth his own &s;oul; all they that hate me, love death.</HI> Their Hatred of Chri&s;t

<P>USE 1. <HI>Have Go&s;pel-Impenitents no Cloke for their Sin! Hence we may learn</HI> the Ju&s;tice of God <HI>in the eternal Condemnation, &amp; aggra|vated Puni&s;hment of &s;uch in a future State.</HI></P>
<P>An holy, a jealous, and omnipotent God will one day call Sinners into Judg|ment, and will judge the World in Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, rendring to every man accor|ding to his Deeds. And as the Rules of Ju&s;tice require that greater Sinners &s;hould have a greater Puni&s;hment; hence Go&s;|pel Sinners, who knew their Lord's Will, and prepared not them&s;elves to do it, &s;hall in that day be adjudged to peculiar Pains, and be beaten with many &s;tripes. The wilful ob&s;tinacy of Go&s;pel-Impenitents exceedingly increa&s;es their Guilt; and makes the Divine Ju&s;tice in their Con|demnation &s;hine out with a tran&s;cendent Glory. The whole World of intelligent Beings will unite their Suffrages, and pro|claim the Equity of the Divine Sentence
<PB N="65" REF="003281_0067_0FF03D9A1BDDA6D8">
in that Day. Yea, the Sinners them&s;elves &s;hall a&s;cribe Righteou&s;ne&s;s to their Ma|ker, and as to all Pretences of Inju&s;tice in his dealings with them, will be <HI>&s;peechle&s;s,</HI> and cover'd with Confu&s;ion. This is re|pre&s;ented in the Parable, <HI>Mat.</HI> 22.11, 12. <HI>And when the king came in to &s;ee the gue&s;ts, he &s;aw there a man which had not on a wedding garment: And he &s;aith unto him, Friend, how came&s;t thou in hither, not ha|ving a wedding garment? And he was &s;peechle&s;s.</HI> Every Plea will be wre&s;ted out of Sinners Mouths, by the Advantages they have enjoy'd, and the Profe&s;&s;ion they made, under the Go&s;pel: Which will all come in as &s;o many Items to accumulate the Guilt of their Impenitency, and in|flame their Account. They &s;hall no more be able to drown the Voice of Con&s;ci|ence, bribe its Judgment, or elude the force of its Charges by any deceitful Rea|&s;onings. They &s;hall be convinced in that day, however impotent and unable they were of them&s;elves to turn and live to God; that yet their not doing it was owing to the Malignity of their Wills, and the Enmity in their carnal Minds again&s;t Chri&s;t and his Ways, rather than to an involuntary Weakne&s;s or in&s;uperable Op|po&s;ition from their &s;piritual Enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="003281_0068_0FF03D7532900010">It might &s;eem &s;ufficient to vindicate the judicial procedures of the great Day, that <HI>God</HI> is <HI>&s;overeign.</HI> Is it not &s;aid, He <HI>hath Mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth? Hath not the Potter power over the Clay, of the &s;ame Lump, to make one Ve&s;&s;el unto Honour and another unto Di&s;honour?</HI> Where God has deny'd effectual &s;aving Grace to any, has he with-holden from them what he <HI>owed</HI> them? Nay, is it not a ju&s;t Puni&s;hment of their &s;in in <HI>Adam,</HI> to take the Forfeiture he made of Heaven and Happine&s;s for them, by breaking the Covenant of Life, made with him as our common Head? God might upbraid them in &s;uch Language as that, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.21. <HI>Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right &s;eed: how then art thou turned into the de|generate plant of a &s;trange vine unto me</HI>?</P>
<P>But <HI>God</HI> will make Impenitents to know in that day that he does not proceed with them in a way of meer de&s;potick Sove|reignty, but according to the &s;tricte&s;t Rules of rectoral Holine&s;s: That neither does he only condemn them for original Sin, and puni&s;h them meerly for their native Infir|mity &amp; Corruption: but for their <HI>contracted</HI> Impotence and <HI>per&s;onal</HI> Rebellions; for their carnal Sloth, and indulged Enmity; for their wilful Infidelity, their affected
<PB N="67" REF="003281_0069_0FEFDB48D5652088">
Ignorance, and cho&s;en Di&s;obedience. He will make them to know that thus their De&s;truction is of them&s;elves: the Re&s;ult of their own criminal Choice. He will upbraid them, as in <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.17. <HI>Ha&s;t thou not procured this unto thy &s;elf, in that thou ha&s;t for&s;aken the Lord thy God, when he led thee by the way?</HI></P>
<P>God will wa&s;h his hands in Innocency, and pronounce them guilty of their own Blood. Yea, they them&s;elves will acquit God, and declare his Throne faultle&s;s al|together. Con&s;cience will fly in their faces, and joyn with God in condemning them. They will acknowledge in that day, God has done all that became a wi&s;e and gracious Sovereign to do, in the way of Means, for the bringing them to Repen|tance; and will bitterly bewail it that they did &s;o grieve and vex the holy Spi|rit: that they did &s;o de&s;pi&s;e their Bible, their Bapti&s;m, their Sabbaths, their Mi|ni&s;ters, their Parents, and faithful Repro|vers. Thus the Ca&s;e is repre&s;ented, <HI>Pro.</HI> 5.11, 12, 13. <HI>And thou mourn at the la&s;t, when thy fle&s;h and thy body are con&s;umed, And &s;ay, How have I hated in&s;truction, &amp; my heart de&s;pi&s;ed reproof? And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that in&s;tructed me</HI>?</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="003281_0070_0FF03D784CF3CFA8">They will &s;ub&s;cribe to the Equity of the Sentence pa&s;&s;ed upon them; and tho' they once thought the <HI>Threatning</HI> &s;evere, they will then confe&s;s the <HI>Execution</HI> is ju&s;t upon them. Tho' they were once ready to &s;ay, God would be cruel, if he &s;hould puni&s;h tran&s;ient offences with per|petual Sufferings; they will then own with loud and bitter Accents, that they were cruel to their own Souls, and madly run them&s;elves into Hell.</P>
<P>But I proceed to another Reflection.</P>
<P>USE 2. <HI>Hence the Awfulne&s;s of our &s;tanding under the Go&s;pel, and the mi&s;era|ble</HI> Delu&s;ion <HI>of &s;uch as tru&s;t to meer Pri|vileges and Externals in Religion.</HI></P>
<P>Our Standing in God's Vineyard is a matter of joyful, and yet al&s;o of awful Con&s;ideration. For the Axe is now laid to the Root of the Trees, and every Tree which bringeth not forth good Fruit, <HI>&s;hall be cut down &amp; ca&s;t into the Fire.</HI> Matth. 3.10. Our Go&s;pel-Privileges are no Security from the Wrath to come. <HI>Joab</HI> may fly to the Horns of the Altar; and yet be hewn in pieces before the Lord. Mul|titudes cry, <HI>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord</HI>: and think this will exempt them from the common Doom of ungodly Sinners. But alas! their
<PB N="69" REF="003281_0071_0FF03D9EAF10FEF8">
Go&s;pel-Advantages will be &s;o far from being Pleas for Mercy, that they will rather loudly imprecate Vengeance on the guilty Heads of &s;uch as have de&s;pis'd and abu&s;ed them. The&s;e things &s;erve but to enhaunce their Guilt, and &s;o in|title them to a greater Damnation. The Apo&s;tle mentions it as a very aggravating Circum&s;tance of Sin, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.23. <HI>Thou that make&s;t thy boa&s;t of the law, through break|ing the law, di&s;honoure&s;t thou God?</HI></P>
<P>O then &s;ee to it, that none <HI>tru&s;t in ly|ing words,</HI> and flatter them&s;elves with vain Imaginations: for the Lord will reject your Confidences, and you &s;hall not pro&s;per in them. See <HI>Mat.</HI> 7.21, &amp;c. Be not high-minded then, but fear. Don't depend on a meer Profe&s;&s;ion, and religious externals: but look to your Hearts that they be right with God. Work out your Salvation with Fear &amp; Trembling. Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for <HI>what|&s;oever a man &s;oweth, that &s;hall he al&s;o reap&punc;</HI></P>
<P>USE 3. <HI>Hence the Folly of</HI> Delay <HI>in the grand Affair of Conver&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>Have Go&s;pel-Sinners no Cloke for their Sin! How unrea&s;onable then are Delays in the matter of turning to God, and co|ming to Chri&s;t! O delaying Sinner! you can never ju&s;tify your Conduct, but mu&s;t &s;uffer the Reproach of acting a very fooli&s;h
<PB N="70" REF="003281_0072_0FF03D7A9CB3D6E0">
part in neglecting for even one moment &s;o great Salvation. Thou art <HI>inexcu&s;able,</HI> O man, whoever thou art, and can&s;t ne|ver vindicate thy <HI>pa&s;t</HI> Behaviour. And wilt thou <HI>yet</HI> go on? Wilt thou go on after repeated Calls and Warnings, and &s;trivings of the holy Spirit with you! Art thou not convinced, do's not thy Con&s;cience tell thee, that thou ha&s;t no Pleas &s;uffici|ent to defend thee? O how can&s;t thou neglect thy Saviour and thy Soul from day to day, and year to year! Art thou not afraid of God's Judgments falling upon thee? What can &s;creen you from the Strokes of vindictive Ju&s;tice? What do you think &s;hould &s;tay the Hand of Vengeance? And when God ari&s;es to take hand on Judgment, what will you do? What will you plead? Can thine Heart endure, or can thine Hands be &s;trong, in the day that he &s;hall deal with thee? Is it not a mo&s;t fearful and tremendous thing, to fall into the Hands of the living God! See then the Danger and the Folly of Delays: and now, even <HI>now,</HI> while it is called to day, be &s;triving to enter in at the &s;trait gate, and no lon|ger harden your Heart.</P>
<P>O let us all be exhorted &s;eriou&s;ly to <HI>con&s;ider</HI> how inexcu&s;able we &s;hall be, if
<PB N="71" REF="003281_0073_0FF03DA1B9824658">
we die impenitent; and let this be a prevailing <HI>Motive</HI> with us to come to Chri&s;t and turn to God without Delay.</P>
<P>Whatever way of Sin we may be walk|ing in, O let us reflect upon the inexcu|&s;able Folly we are guilty of, and the Haz|ard we run of Damning our own Souls, if we do not in&s;tantly turn and give our Hearts to the Lord. God expo&s;tulates with us, as in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.31, 32. <HI>Ca&s;t away from you all your tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, whereby ye have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, and make you a new heart, and a new &s;pirit; for why will ye die, O hou&s;e of If&s;ael? For I have no plea|&s;ure in the death of him that dieth, &s;aith the Lord God: wherefore turn your &s;elves, and live ye.</HI> Let us con&s;ider &s;olemnly with our &s;elves, that none of us have any Cloke for our Sin. The <HI>Vicious</HI> &amp; immoral have no Cloke for their Sin, who will not ab&s;tain from tho&s;e gro&s;s Acts of Sinning, which they might refrain if they would, nor avoid tho&s;e Temptations, which they might ea&s;ily keep out of the way of. The Drunkard has no Cloke for his Sin, the Adulterer, the Liar, the Injurious, the Worldling, have no Cloke for their Sin: &s;ince they will not take any Care, nor u&s;e the Power they have, to keep them|&s;elves from their own Iniquity. They
<PB N="72" REF="003281_0074_0FF03D7C20C50DA8">
love their Lu&s;ts, and will not part with them. So the <HI>Profane,</HI> the Irreligious, the Formal, and the carnally Secure have no Cloke for their Sin: for they will not employ, nor &s;tudy to improve, the natu|ral Abilities God has given them, by at|tending only on the Means of Grace, and by &s;triving to work up their Hearts to a &s;utable Frame, by Meditation, by Self-Examination, Prayer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Surely &s;uch have no Cloke for their Sin. O let us con&s;ider, whatever Rank of Sinners we belong to, if we peri&s;h at la&s;t, we &s;hall be found utterly inexcu&s;able. Neither Chri&s;t nor Con&s;cience will have any Plea to make for us: but will both joyn in ac|cu&s;ing and impleading us. We &s;hall &s;tand indited of Murder, the mo&s;t heinous, e|ven Self-Murder, the Murder of our Souls, wilful premeditated Self-Murder, &amp; mu&s;t peri&s;h without Remedy. The Guilt of Blood, of our own Blood, will be upon our heads: and we &s;hall have none to commi&s;erate us, even our own Con&s;ciences will be enraged again&s;t us. Satan will accu&s;e, and God condemn us. No Eye will pity, nor can any Arm &s;ave us.</P>
<P>And now may it not well &s;trike a Ter|ror upon us to meditate the&s;e things! O let us earne&s;tly &s;eek to God for his Spirit
<PB N="73" REF="003281_0075_0FF03DA341A79D50">
to renew us unto Repentance, and be waiting on him in all the ways of his Appointment. Let none be carele&s;s and &s;ecure. For <HI>how &s;hall you e&s;cape,</HI> if you neglect &s;o great Salvation? And why <HI>&s;hould&s;t thou de&s;troy thy &s;elf?</HI> Are you brought to the very Gate of Heaven, and will you refu&s;e to enter in? You are now not far from the Kingdom perhaps: and will you &s;hut your &s;elf out by a re&s;olv'd Impenitence! Will you bid Defiance to a gracious Redeemer, and do De&s;pite to the Holy Spirit; and will you be fal&s;e to that God who&s;e you are, &amp; whom you pro|fe&s;s to Serve! Will you gratify the Devil, and do more again&s;t your &s;elf, than all your &s;piritual Enemies could do again&s;t you! Are you lo&s;t to all Sen&s;e of the natural Prin|ciple of Self-pre&s;ervation! Shall you not one day regret your Folly! How will you bear to &s;ee others in Glory, who lived under the &s;ame Means with you, and your &s;elf excluded! Will it not occa&s;ion very bit|ter and cutting Reflections in your guilty Brea&s;t! Will it not excite Envy, Rage, and Horrour, and awaken every torment|ing Pa&s;&s;ion in you! Read <HI>Luk.</HI> 13.24 <HI>to</HI> 28.</P>
<P>O let the&s;e Reflections &s;ink down into our Hearts, and make us to be looking diligently left we &s;ail of the Grace of God.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="003281_0076_0FF03D7E66E9AF68">Let us con&s;ider the <HI>Shortne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Un|certainty</HI> of our Opportunities: and if we mean ever to repent and &s;ubmit to Chri&s;t, let us do it <HI>quickly,</HI> without any further Delay. All the pretended Grounds of Delay are ab&s;urd, and will not bear a Te&s;t. We are none of us &s;o young, as to make it too early for us to mind the concerns of our Souls: nor any of us &s;o old, as to make it too late for pardoning Mercy to be glorify'd upon us. Whatever Bu|&s;ine&s;s, Hurry or Incumbrance may attend us now, yet we cannot hope for a more convenient Sea&s;on, than the pre&s;ent, to work out our Salvation. Moral Impe|diments will increa&s;e upon our hands by every days neglect. If we be not wil|ling to day, it is probable we &s;hall be le&s;s willing to morrow. If we be inex|cu&s;able now, we &s;hall be more inexcu&s;a|ble hereafter. It is a mi&s;erable Conditi|on we are in, while impenitent and with|out Chri&s;t: and we lie expos'd to awful Hazards, to the Lo&s;s of the &s;triving Spi|rit, to the Lo&s;s of Rea&s;on, and of Life. <HI>There is but a &s;tep between us &amp; Death:</HI> and <HI>wo to us, if we die in our Sins.</HI> Alas! we &s;tand on the very brink of <HI>Hell,</HI> &s;o long as we refu&s;e Chri&s;t and do the Lu&s;ts of the Devil. Let us then immediately renounce
<PB N="75" REF="003281_0077_0FF03DA4C9075338">
our Sins, and yield our &s;elves to the Lord. Let it be our pre&s;ent &amp; fixed Re&s;olution to &s;eek the Lord while he may be found; and never give over &s;eeking, &s;triving and praying, until he be found of us. If we put off this great Concern, we &s;hall &s;ooner or later bitterly repent our Delays: but if we ha&s;ten our Flight to Chri&s;t, this will be no Grief of Heart to us, but matter of joyful Reflection. Yea, there is Joy in <HI>Heaven</HI> over one Sinner that repenteth.</P>
<P>USE. 4. If Go&s;pel-Impenitents are inex|cu&s;able, who peri&s;h in their own Iniquity; <HI>how much more &s;uch Sinners as are voluntari|ly In&s;trumental to the Sin &amp; Ruin of others!</HI></P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of &s;ome, Rom. 1.32. <HI>Who knowing the judgment of God (that they which commit &s;uch things are worthy of death) not only do the &s;ame, but have plea&s;ure in them that do them.</HI> They intice others to &s;in with them, they rejoyce in Iniquity, and take pains to promote it.

<P><PB N="76" REF="003281_0078_0FF03D81B61E7A18">USE 5. <HI>What abundant Rea&s;on have they to admire the</HI> Grace <HI>of God toward them, who af|ter a Cour&s;e of great Sin under Go&s;pel-Light, have been Converted!</HI></P>
<P>If <HI>Paul,</HI> who obtained Mercy, when he &s;in|ned ignorantly in Unbelief, found Occa&s;ion to &s;ay, <HI>The Grace of our Lord was exceeding abun|dant</HI> toward him; how much more do's the &s;ame Grace abound, when &s;uch as under the Go&s;pel have &s;inned wilfully after they had receiv'd the Knowledge of the Truth, do come notwith|&s;tanding to be Partakers of the Benefit!
