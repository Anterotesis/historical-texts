<P>It is &s;aid unto <HI>THIS DAY,</HI> In the Mount of the LORD, it &s;hall be &s;een.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AND upon THIS DAY, What Remarkable, What Admirable Occa&s;ions, has our Glorious GOD given us to Repeat this <HI>Proverb of I&s;rael!</HI></P>
<P>AS there never was any Man on the Face of the Earth, who&s;e <HI>Name</HI> has been &s;o uni|ver&s;ally known among the Children of Men, as the Patriarch <HI>Abrabam,</HI> to whom a <HI>Great Name</HI> had been Promi&s;ed by our GOD, &s;o
<PB N="2" REF="002043_0004_0FBA8E4C23773170">there is nothing more known about this Renowned Patriarch, than this, <HI>By Faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up I&s;aac; and be that had received the Promi&s;es, offered up his only begotten Son; Accounting that GOD was able to Rai&s;e him up even from the Dead.</HI> This Memorable <HI>Friend of GOD,</HI> after ma|ny previous Trials, at la&s;t had his <HI>Faith tri|ed</HI> unto the uttermo&s;t, with an Order from the Sovereign Lord of Life, making His u&s;u|al De&s;cent in the <HI>Shechinah</HI> unto him; an order whereof every Word was a Thunder|bolt; It was, <HI>Take now thy Son, thine only Son, I&s;aac, whom thou love&s;t, and get thee into a Land, forty miles off, and offer him for a Burnt offering upon a Mountain there.</HI> The <HI>Obedience</HI> which our Father paid unto this a&s;toni&s;hing Order, has been celebrated in all Succeeding Ages, and with very many Nati|ons. The Ancients, who have employ'd their Pens in the celebration, have al&s;o told us, that the Story was rarely beheld in a <HI>Picture,</HI> without <HI>Weeping Eyes</HI> among them. The Pagans had their famous Traditions of the Matter; E&s;pecially That of <HI>Saturn</HI> Sa|crificing of his <HI>Jeoud.</HI> The Jews tell us, That the Two Sons of <HI>Sennacherth</HI> had like to have been a <HI>Sacrifue</HI> to the Tradition of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s. I am not &s;ure, That <HI>Satan</HI> took Advantage from hence, to draw the poor Pagans into <HI>Humane Sacrifices,</HI> particularly
<PB N="3" REF="002043_0005_0FBA8E4E2A231430">of their Children unto <HI>Moloch.</HI> But I find <HI>philo,</HI> notably cen&s;uring and confuting the Envious Detractions of tho&s;e who would go to compare them with the Piety of our In|comparable <HI>Abraham.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Action</HI> you know. The Action of Binding <HI>I&s;aac</HI> on the <HI>Altar,</HI> on the Account whereof the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s is by the Jews called, <HI>Gnakidah Jitzchah,</HI> Or, <HI>The Binding of I&s;aac.</HI> The brave Young Man, tho' above Twenty Years of Age, readily Submitted un|to this Action of his Father. Doubtle&s;s the &s;ame <HI>Eaith</HI> which was in his Excellent Fa|ther, filled and acted the Soul of this won|derful Youth! But what was the <HI>I&s;&s;ue</HI> of the Action?</P>
<P>Our Glorious GOD would &s;ee the Triumph of the <HI>Faith,</HI> with which He had Enriched the Soul of the Patriarch; and at the &s;ame time give in his <HI>I&s;aac</HI> a Lively, and Lovely Type of what was afterwards to be done unto our SAVIOUR. <HI>Abraham</HI> does as firm|ly Believe, that GOD would Rai&s;e his <HI>I&s;aac</HI> from the Dead, yea, out of his A&s;hes, as if he had &s;een it with his Eyes. <HI>I&s;aac</HI> is laid on the <HI>Altar.</HI> Every thing is ready for the <HI>Mortal Stroke.</HI> The Father gives his <HI>La&s;t Ki&s;s</HI> to the Re&s;igning Victim. The <HI>Knife</HI> is in his hand. His <HI>hand</HI> is lifted up. One Second of a Minute more, and the <HI>deadly Stab</HI> reaches the Heart that lay expos'd un|to
<PB N="4" REF="002043_0006_0FBA8E4FB3F8A830">to it; <HI>I&s;aac</HI> is a <HI>Dead Man</HI> without any more ado. But behold, GOD by an <HI>Angel</HI> from Heaven, <HI>Steps in at the very Moment:</HI> The Voice of GOD by an Angel, calls to him, <HI>Stop, Stay, Lay not thy hand upon the Sacrifice!</HI>&mdash; O mo&s;t <HI>Sea&s;onable Interpo&s;ition!</HI> What a <HI>De|liverance,</HI> in what an <HI>Extremity! Abraham</HI> could not but &s;ettle a <HI>Memorial</HI> of this Mi|raculous Deliverance, in the Name of, JE|HOVAH-JIREH, on the Place where he received it. <HI>GOD will provide;</HI> This was the Engli&s;h of it. You know, That the <HI>Mountain</HI> was al&s;o called, <HI>Moriah,</HI> which is of the like Importance. And you know, what was afterwards done upon that Exalted <HI>Mountain of the Hou&s;e of the Lord.</HI> And now, Don't wonder, that we now hear of a <HI>Proverb,</HI> which from this amazing Occur|rence obtained among the People of GOD, in the Succeeding Ages. A <HI>Proverb,</HI> which has been called, <HI>Proverbium Tribulatorum:</HI> A Sentence fitted for the People of GOD, in every <HI>Extremity</HI> of Adver&s;ity: A &s;aying with which the People of GOD &s;hould ani|mate their Expectation of Help to come from Heaven, when any Adver&s;ity comes to an <HI>Extremity</HI> upon them. The Proverb is, <HI>In the Mount of the Lord it &s;hall be &s;een.</HI> O Peo|ple of GOD, When a Perplexity comes upon you to an <HI>Extremity</HI> like what <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>I&s;aac</HI> &s;aw in the <HI>Mount</HI> Which the Lord led
<PB N="5" REF="002043_0007_0FBA8E5180690AA0">them to, then <HI>it &s;hall be &s;een,</HI> what GOD will do for you; <HI>it &s;hall be &s;een,</HI> how GOD will appear for your <HI>Deliverance.</HI> Sooner &s;hall the <HI>Mountain</HI> of <HI>Moriah</HI> depart, and the <HI>Hill</HI> of GOD be removed, than this <HI>Proverb</HI> grow into a De&s;uetude.</P>
<P>Behold, The Entertainment that is now provided for you. A Relation of <HI>Sea&s;onable Interpo&s;itions from Heave, for the Relie&s; of the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed,</HI> is what is now to Entertain you.</P>
<P><HI>A Sea&s;onable Interpo&s;ition of the Divine Pro|vidence to prevent the De&s;truction of &s;uch as are upon the very Point of being De|&s;troyed; This is a Di&s;pen&s;ation, much to be wondred at, and &s;till to be looked for.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis no Rare Thing for the Glorious GOD, <HI>Sea&s;onably to Step in,</HI> and prevent the <HI>Sacri|fice,</HI> which we are <HI>upon the Point</HI> of being brought unto. 'Tis no Rare Thing, for the Glorious GOD <HI>Sea&s;onably to Step in,</HI> and put by a Deadly Blow, which is <HI>upon the very Point</HI> of being Struck at our deare&s;t Intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>The <HI>Succour</HI> which our GOD has for us in our <HI>Di&s;tre&s;&s;es,</HI> is often <HI>deferr'd</HI> until we even De&s;pair of a <HI>Deliverance.</HI> But when Things are come to an <HI>Extremity, Then</HI> 'tis then He <HI>Steps in</HI> to Succour us.</P>
<P>We read of our GOD and SAVIOUR, Heb. IV. 16. That from Him, we <HI>obtain Mercy and
<PB N="6" REF="002043_0008_0FBA8E52F79FAB78">find Fevour, to Help in a Time of Need.</HI> But the <HI>Time of Need,</HI> wherein the <HI>Only Wi&s;e GOD</HI> chu&s;es to <HI>help</HI> us, is, when our <HI>Nece&s;&s;i|ty</HI> comes to an <HI>Extremity.</HI> And then He takes as we &s;ay, the very <HI>Nick of Time,</HI> to &s;end in His <HI>Help</HI> unto us.</P>
<P>We may give this LOCTRINE of <HI>Sea&s;o|nable Interpo&s;itions,</HI> in the Terms of an Old &s;aying very common among the People of GOD, <HI>Mans Extremity is GODs Opportunity.</HI> Is there not &s;uch a Promi&s;e as That, Zech. XIV. 7. <HI>At Evening it &s;hall be light.</HI> At <HI>E|vening!</HI> Who would have Expected a break|ing forth of <HI>Light</HI> in the <HI>Evening?</HI> A <HI>Morn|ing</HI> of Salvations in an <HI>Evening</HI> of Di&s;tre&s;&s;es! But GOD will <HI>Perform</HI> what He does <HI>Pro|mi&s;e.</HI> And the <HI>Upright</HI> &s;hall in their <HI>Dark|ne&s;s</HI> have <HI>Light ari&s;ing</HI> to them.</P>
<P>We will Declare, fir&s;t, THAT it <HI>has been</HI> &s;o.</P>
<P>Let us for a few Minutes walk about the Field of <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> and gather here and there a <HI>Ro&s;e of Sharon;</HI> Make a brief Collection of In&s;tances, wherein GOD has with <HI>Sea&s;o|nable Interpo&s;itions,</HI> come in for the Relief of the Faithful, when <HI>Extreme Dangers</HI> of Ruine have &s;orely terrified them.</P>
<P>And here, Oh! Let it not be forgotten,&mdash; indeed, I cannot go on with my <HI>Collection,</HI> till I fir&s;t make this <HI>Introduction</HI> to it!&mdash; It mu&s;t be Remembred, That <HI>Mankind</HI> upon
<PB N="7" REF="002043_0009_0FBA8E55804152A8">our Fir&s;t Fall, was ju&s;t <HI>upon the very Point,</HI> of being made a <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> unto the Infinite <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of GOD: The out-&s;tretched Arm of Infinite <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> was ready to give the Stroke. The <HI>Powers of Heaven &s;hook;</HI> None of them could &s;ee how it could be diverted. But GOD then did <HI>Provide a Sacrifice.</HI> The <HI>Son</HI> of GOD with a mo&s;t <HI>Sea&s;onable Interpo&s;ition</HI> did then Step in; and &s;ay, <HI>I will be the Sa|crifice.</HI> Chri&s;tians, Behold your SAVIOUR <HI>Sacrificed</HI> on Mount <HI>Calvary;</HI> [Yea, &s;ome look on Mount <HI>Calvary</HI> as an Appendage to Mount <HI>Moriah!</HI>] and then cry out, <HI>The Lord &s;een in the Mount! The Lord &s;een in the Mount!</HI> The World has never &s;een any thing equal to this Di&s;pen&s;ation. The Son of GOD, <HI>Saw, and there was no Man, and wondred that there was no Interce&s;&s;or. There|fore His Arm did bring Salvation;</HI> HE Step'd in, and Saved at this <HI>Exremity!</HI> It has been indeed for the &s;ake of this <HI>Appearance</HI> of <HI>the Great GOD our SAVIOUR,</HI> that we have been made able to go on unto the In&s;tances which we now proceed unto.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t.

A <HI>Sea&s;onable Death</HI> gave a <HI>Mortal Wound</HI> unto the Undertaking; very much Di&s;pirited the Undertakers, Di&s;concerted all their
<PB N="28" REF="002043_0030_0FBA8E7CC7C20DB0">Mea&s;ures! The <HI>Leviathen</HI> at <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> being Smitten of GOD, Putrified into a mo&s;t loth &s;ome Carca&s;e, and left off to <HI>Make the World a Wilderne&s;s, and to de&s;troy the Cities thereof.</HI> The <HI>Tree</HI> that &s;heltered and che|ri&s;hed the Birds of Prey was mo&s;t <HI>Sca&s;ona|bly</HI> hewn down by the Order of GOD.

<P>The La&s;t Winter the Men who are <HI>Like the troubled Sea,</HI> prepared for another Inva|&s;ion. A <HI>Sea&s;onable Death</HI> again gave a <HI>Mor|tal Wound</HI> unto the Undertaking; and with|drew the A&s;&s;i&s;tences which the Undertakers mightily relied upon. A Monatch who had <HI>cau&s;ed Terror in the Land of the Living,</HI> was mo&s;t <HI>Sea&s;onably</HI> taken off; And thereby, as the Oppre&s;&s;ed <HI>Swedes</HI> have had their <HI>Go|thick Liberties</HI> Miraculou&s;ly <HI>Re&s;tor'd</HI> unto them, &s;o there was a Thing of Great Con|&s;equence done towards the <HI>Pri&s;erving</HI> of ours. The Embarcation from <HI>Spain</HI> indeed went on. But, when there was above an
<PB N="29" REF="002043_0031_0FBA8E7E1C09DF28">hundred and thirty Years ago, a De&s;cent from <HI>Spain</HI> upon our Fore-fathers, within Navy that called it &s;elf, <HI>Invincible,</HI> GOD fought again&s;t it, and by the <HI>Stormy Wind ful|filling His Word,</HI> confounded that Expediti|on. And now another De&s;cent from <HI>Spain</HI> was making upon us, GOD who holds <HI>the Wind in His Hand,</HI> by His own Irre&s;i&s;tible Hand, brought all the co&s;tly Expedition to Nothing. But He Step'd in, how <HI>Opportune|ly,</HI> how much at the very <HI>Nick of Time,</HI> with Di&s;pen&s;ations to be for ever wondred at!</P>
<P>O the <HI>Triumphs</HI> of Soveraign <HI>Grace,</HI> in the&s;e <HI>Divine Appearances,</HI> for our mo&s;t Un|worthy Nations! I <HI>will &s;ing unto</HI> our mo&s;t Gracious GOD. <HI>for He has triumphed gloriou&s;ly!</HI></P>
<P>NEW-ENGLAND is Thankfully &s;en&s;ible of the &s;hare which it has in the <HI>Sea&s;onable Salvations</HI> wherewith our Nation had been thus <HI>highly favoured of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>But then, How many <HI>Peculiar Salvations</HI> hath NEW-ENGLAND &s;een, wherein our Glorious LORD has mu&s;t <HI>Sea&s;onably</HI> Interpo|&s;ed for us, in our <HI>Extremities.</HI> Tho&s;e <HI>Mag|nalia CHRISTI.</HI> ever the <HI>Sea&s;onable in|terpo&s;itions</HI> of GOD out SAVIOUR, to deliver us, when <HI>Extreme Hazards</HI> of Ruine look'd very dark upon, us; The&s;e are Things which
<PB N="30" REF="002043_0032_0FBA8E81894B3620">the Hi&s;tory of NEW-ENGLAND is filled withal. <HI>Many a Time,</HI> let NEW-ENG|LAND now &s;ay, <HI>Many a Time, in Affliction, from my Youth, had the De&s;troyers prevailed again&s;t me, if my Glorious Lord had not Sea|&s;onably Step'd in to re&s;cue me.</HI> Verily, NEW-ENGLAND <HI>continues to this Day,</HI> having <HI>obtained Help from GOD,</HI> in &s;uch Sea&s;onable Di&s;pen&s;ations!</P>
<P>One Time above the re&s;t, cannot but be Remembred by many that <HI>remain to this Day.</HI> Some who did then <HI>Jeopard their Lives in the High Places of the Field,</HI> are now in this very Auditory. There was a Time Three and Forty Years ago, when the fierce <HI>Indian</HI> Salvages, having Spred the Flame of a Dubious War, from One End of the Coun|try to the Other, Every One thought, the Summer then coming on, would be fill'd with De&s;olations, that would very near have broke Up the Colonics. But Behold, when Things were come to that <HI>Extremity,</HI> GOD Step'd in, and made bare His Almighty Arm for our <HI>Deliverance.</HI> The Enemy di&s;tracted like Bea&s;ts that are Stung with <HI>Hornets,</HI> fell an ea&s;y Prey, to the <HI>People In|habiting the Wilderne&s;s.</HI> Yea, <HI>Sword</HI> and <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> in a few Months con&s;umed whole Nations of them!</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="002043_0033_0FBA8E83ED9CF0E0">
This has indeed been the way of GOD our SAVIOUR all along Appearing for us.</P>
<P>What a <HI>Sea&s;onable Provi&s;ion</HI> did our GOD make for us, by a <HI>Friend on the Spot,</HI> appear|ing at the Court for us, at the Revolution, that we might be delivered from a Total and Final Deprivation of all the <HI>Privileges,</HI> which di&s;tingui&s;hed us, from the re&s;t of the Plantations!</P>
<P>How often have we been upon <HI>the very Print,</HI> of being made the <HI>Prey of the Terrible?</HI> Tho&s;e which are called, <HI>The wild-bea&s;ts of the Earth,</HI> have been ju&s;t coming upon us! But the Great GOVERNOUR of the World, <HI>Sea&s;onably Stepping in,</HI> has very Unexpected|ly more than Twice done the Things, which have enabled us to &s;ay, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, who has not given us as a prey to their Teeth!</HI></P>
<P>How often have our Churches been upon <HI>the very Point</HI> of doing Things which would have been attended with an Unknown Train of <HI>Di&s;turbances?</HI> But their Glorious HEAD <HI>Sea&s;onably Stepping in,</HI> has put a <HI>Stop</HI> unto them, and the <HI>feared Storms</HI> have all blown over.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Who can Utter the mighty Acts of the Lord? Who can &s;hew forth all His Prai&s;e?</HI> How long a work would it be to Recapitu|late the <HI>Sea&s;onable Interpo&s;itions,</HI> wherewith

<P>The Improvement, which we are to make of this <HI>Experience,</HI> mu&s;t be to Encourage our <HI>Prayers</HI> and our <HI>Hopes</HI> for the continuance of it.

<P>You will allow me to u&s;e the Language of the Day; and &s;ay, There may be Things which may threaten to <HI>Blow up</HI> the Coun|try, and <HI>Blow up</HI> the <HI>Churches,</HI> which have the <HI>Beauty</HI> and the <HI>Safety</HI> of the Country in them.
