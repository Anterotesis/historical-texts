<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN it plea&s;ed the Lord to manife&s;t the glorious di&s;pen&s;ation of his ble&s;&s;ed Son our Saviour, apo&s;tles were called and &s;ent forth in his &s;ervice; and many believed in his name.</P>
<P>And in the early times of Chri&s;tianity, it was found ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the apo&s;tles and believers to meet often together, for the comfort, con&s;olation and help, one of another; where, pur&s;uant to the glorious de&s;ign of the Go&s;pel, which breathes Peace on Earth, and Good Will towards men, love and charity greatly abounded; and a care aro&s;e for the e&s;tabli&s;hment and pre&s;ervation of the church, that all might be of one mind, and walk by the &s;ame rule, as became the followers of their holy Lord and Law-giver. And as this love and charity, the e&s;&s;ence of pure and undefiled religion, was abode in, tho&s;e meetings were owned, and witne&s;&s;ed to be times of refre&s;h|ment from the holy Head of the Church.</P>
<P>But in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of time, the &s;implicity and good purpo&s;es of tho&s;e meetings were greatly lo&s;t, by rea&s;on of the declen|&s;ion and falling away of the profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tian Churches; and a particular denomination of men, for worldly and car|nal ends, a&s;&s;uming an authority and exerci&s;ing lord&s;hip over the flock. Yet after a long and dark night of apo&s;tacy, it plea&s;ed the Lord to bring many from under that darkne&s;s which had over&s;pread the profe&s;&s;ors of the Chri&s;tian religion; and of latter days to gather a people more fully into a &s;tate of Go&s;pel freedom, whereby our predece&s;&s;ors witne&s;&s;ed the prevalence of that primitive Love and Good Will, and were led by Holy direction, to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of meetings for the like good purpo&s;es as in primitive times; and for the
<PB N="iv" REF="037474_0003_100D12751D2CE710" MS="y">
more regular and orderly proceeding in tho&s;e &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed for the di&s;cipline of the Church, they are &s;ubordinate one to another, as preparative, con&s;i&s;ting of friends belonging to one or more meetings for wor&s;hip; monthly, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;o many preparatives as may conveniently compo&s;e the &s;ame; quarterly, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;o many monthly meetings as may be judged mo&s;t &s;uitable; yearly, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;o many quarterly meetings as may mo&s;t u&s;efully meet together once a year, for the &s;uperintending care and health of the body.</P>
<P>And in order that the&s;e purpo&s;es may be more fully an|&s;wered, the following rules and regulations are, on due con|&s;ideration, recommended to the ob&s;ervance of friends, over|&s;eers and meetings. And in the exerci&s;e of which, care, per|&s;ua&s;ion and gentle dealing, ought to be our practice, labour|ing in love and meekne&s;s, to bring &s;uch as tran&s;gre&s;s to a &s;en&s;e of their error. But if any, by our Chri&s;tian endea|vours, cannot be reclaimed, the extent of our judgment and procedure is, the di&s;owning &s;uch to be of our communion. And as this authority and practice is Chri&s;tian, &s;o is it laud|able and rea&s;onable in &s;ociety: and as it is attended to, in uprightne&s;s and &s;inglene&s;s of heart, will tend to promote the good and welfare of the Church, and to unite in a care and concern for the over&s;ight one of another, that all may en|deavour to walk decently, humbly, and hone&s;tly, and be of one mind, as becomes the &s;ervants and followers of our Holy Lord and Law-giver, and to practi&s;e that commendable or|der, ever nece&s;&s;ary in the Chri&s;tian Church, agreeable to that injunction of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, Matt. xviii. 15, 16, 17. <Q>Moreover, if thy brother &s;hall tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone; if he &s;hall hear thee, thou ha&s;t gained thy brother; but if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the
<PB N="v" REF="037474_0004_100D12774E406448">
mouth of two or three witne&s;&s;es, every word may be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed; and if he &s;hall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church; but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man, and a publican.</Q></P>
<P>Al&s;o the expre&s;&s;ions of that eminent apo&s;tle Paul, in his epi&s;tle to the Philippians, iv. 8. <Q>Finally, brethren, what&s;o|ever things are true, what&s;oever things are hone&s;t, what&s;o|ever things are ju&s;t, what&s;oever things are pure, what&s;oever things are lovely, what&s;oever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, and if there be any prai&s;e, think on the&s;e things.</Q> Now, what&s;oever appears in any contrary to the&s;e, may in general be &s;aid to come under the notice of friends, over&s;eers, and meetings.</P>
<P>And as it hath been experienced, that in tho&s;e meetings great comfort and &s;atisfaction have been received and en|joyed, when the members have attended them in awe, humi|lity and love, with no other view than the honour of God, and the help and a&s;&s;i&s;tance one of another, this meeting doth, in brotherly love, exhort all friends carefully to gather in uprightne&s;s and &s;inglene&s;s of heart, &s;uitable to our calling, and the dignity of that Power which will pre&s;ide and govern in all our meetings, as we meekly abide under its holy influ|ence. This will dive&s;t us of partiality and &s;tiffne&s;s of opi|nion, and all high thoughts of our&s;elves, and lead into pa|tience, and conde&s;cen&s;ion, according to that declaration of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, <Q>He that is greate&s;t among you, &s;hall be your &s;ervant.</Q></P>
<P><PB REF="037474_0005_100D127966593708">IT is to be ob&s;erved, that the dates at the end of &s;ome of the minutes and advices denote the years in which they were i&s;&s;ued by the yearly meeting.</P>
<P>The book is printed with blank pages for the purpo&s;e of making future additions, which are to be in&s;erted in the manner and in the page in which they will be directed to be placed by the yearly meeting. No other additions are to be made.</P>
<P>And in order to avoid the frequent repetition of the words he, &s;he, or they, in the following work, the word <HI>he,</HI> only is &s;ometimes made u&s;e of, which is meant to apply to either men or women, as the ca&s;e may be.</P>

<HEAD>MEETINGS FOR WORSHIP.</HEAD>
<P>THAT all friends duly and &s;ea&s;onably attend their meetings e&s;tabli&s;hed for the &s;olemn purpo&s;e of pub|lickly performing true and acceptable wor&s;hip to the Father of Spirits; and carefully avoid &s;uffering any &s;light pretence or worldly bu&s;ine&s;s to occa&s;ion our ab&s;ence from tho&s;e on the middle of the week; or on trivial occa&s;ions leave our children and dependants behind, engaged in our dome&s;tic concerns; awfully keeping in remembrance, that the &s;olemn enquiry will be made, <Q>What ha&s;t thou done with tho&s;e lambs committed to thy care.</Q> Happy then for tho&s;e who feel the &s;upporting evidence, that they have endeavoured in preference to all other concerns for their children, and tho&s;e placed under their care, to train them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</P>
<P>And when a&s;&s;embled, let us be diligent in waiting upon the Lord with fervent de&s;ires, that we may be favoured with the enjoyment of his life-giving pre&s;ence; that &s;o we may be pre&s;erved from wandering thoughts, and from a drow&s;y and lukewarm &s;pirit; and may demon&s;trate that we do indeed wor&s;hip the Father in &s;pirit. Thus, by our pious example, tender-hearted enquirers may be encouraged, to come and partake in our &s;olemn a&s;&s;emblies of that inward and &s;piritual refre&s;hment, which is at times graciou&s;ly imparted to the &s;ouls of the humbly devoted: &s;ome of whom have to acknowledge, that faithfulne&s;s in thus devoting time, in the attendance of meetings, tends greatly to &s;trengthen in coming up with
<PB N="2" REF="037474_0008_100D12801FC9D528">
more propriety in the duties we owe to God, to our families, and to mankind.</P>
<P>And let tho&s;e who frequently neglect, or do not &s;ea&s;on|ably attend our religious meetings, or go out and in unne|ce&s;&s;arily, or otherwi&s;e di&s;turb the meeting, be &s;ea&s;onably cautioned and admoni&s;hed: And parents, ma&s;ters, and mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es, are exhorted to have a godly care over their children and families in tho&s;e re&s;pects.</P>
<P>And when any &s;o manife&s;t their want of love to God, and the unity of the brethren, as to continue in the apparent neglect of attending our religious meetings, and di&s;regard the repeated advice and endeavours of friends to &s;tir them up to this incumbent duty, they are to be dealt with, by the monthly meeting to which they belong, even to di&s;ownment, if after continued tender labour, the ca&s;e may appear to the meeting to require it.</P>

<HEAD>MEETINGS FOR DISCIPLINE.</HEAD>
<P>AND as to the e&s;tabli&s;hment and order of meetings&mdash;That no quarterly meeting be &s;et up or di&s;continued, but by the yearly meeting&punc; no monthly meeting, but by the quarterly; no preparative or meeting for wor&s;hip, but by the monthly meeting, having the approbation of the quarter.</P>
<P>The preparative meeting to keep a record, but not have authority to receive or di&s;own any member, that authority being only in the monthly, quarterly and yearly meetings.</P>
<P>The&s;e meetings are &s;ubordinate and accountable thus: The preparative to the monthly; the monthly to the quar|terly; and the quarterly to the yearly meeting: So that if at any time the yearly meeting be di&s;&s;atisfied with the proceed|ings of any of the &s;aid meetings, or the quarterly with the proceedings of any of the monthly meetings, or the monthly with the proceedings of any of its preparative meetings, &s;uch meetings are directed to render a &s;atisfactory account when required.</P>
<P>And if any quarterly meeting have occa&s;ion for, and re|que&s;t the records or minutes of another quarterly meeting, or one monthly meeting tho&s;e of another, it is directed, that copies of &s;uch minutes or records be accordingly communi|cated to the meeting &s;o reque&s;ting.</P>
<P>That there be at lea&s;t two, or a &s;ufficient number of friends appointed by each monthly meeting to attend the &s;ervice of the quarterly meeting to which they belong, and to pre&s;ent, on behalf and by order of the re&s;pective month|ly meeting, what &s;hall by the &s;aid meeting be given in charge,
<PB N="6" REF="037474_0010_100D128608779270">
which &s;hould be in writing; and that there be for the like &s;ervice, at lea&s;t four friends appointed by each quarterly meeting, to attend the yearly meeting, in manner as above mentioned; and the names of the friends thus appointed, are to be entered on the records of the meeting they are ap|pointed to attend, and the &s;ame method to be ob&s;erved by the quarterly and yearly meeting of mini&s;ters and elders.</P>
<P>That full endeavours be u&s;ed in every monthly meeting, to end all bu&s;ine&s;s that ari&s;es therein, or is brought thereto, with care and di&s;patch; but if they find any bu&s;ine&s;s, or matter, too weighty or difficult for them to determine, they may move the &s;ame to the next quarterly meeting, and in like manner, after due care and endeavours are u&s;ed to end any matter, the quarterly meeting may remove the &s;ame to the next yearly meeting, except in &s;uch ca&s;es where an indi|vidual member may be concerned, or who&s;e right to an ap|peal may be affected, in &s;uch in&s;tances if a monthly meeting finds a difficulty too great for them to determine, they may inform the quarterly meeting, that a &s;ubject is before them in which they de&s;ire a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the quarter is then to appoint &s;ome Friends to &s;et with and a&s;&s;i&s;t the monthly meet|ing in the ca&s;e, and report their attendance only, the merits of the ca&s;e not to be hinted at, either in the report, or in the application of the monthly meeting. Thus will the right of appeal to the quarter be pre&s;erved, and the like &s;teps may be taken in &s;uch other ca&s;es as the monthly meeting may judge proper and nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>And as inconveniences have happened, where friends who&s;e duty it is, or who have been appointed to attend monthly, quarterly, or yearly meetings, or to other &s;ervi|ces, in, or on behalf of any of &s;aid meetings, have delayed, or neglected &s;ea&s;onably attending thereto, it is earne&s;tly de|&s;ired
<PB N="7" REF="037474_0011_100D12883628AB78">
and advi&s;ed, that all friends do carefully attend &s;uch meetings and &s;ervices. And when any friends attend any of &s;aid meetings of bu&s;ine&s;s, that they do not withdraw or leave the &s;ame, until the bu&s;ine&s;s is fini&s;hed, unle&s;s they fir&s;t give the meeting a &s;atisfactory rea&s;on for &s;o doing. And when any, being appointed to &s;ervices as above, are prevented at|tending thereto, by &s;ickne&s;s, or other extraordinary occa&s;i|ons, that they render an account thereof to the meeting.</P>
<P>That committees of meetings, enter &s;ea&s;onably and uni|tedly on the bu&s;ine&s;s of their appointment, and agree on a re|port, to be made by one of their number, the others likewi&s;e &s;tanding to &s;hew their concurrence, which neverthele&s;s may be in writing, where the ca&s;e appears to the meeting to re|quire it; and when they report the bu&s;ine&s;s not accompli&s;h|ed, that they offer rea&s;ons therefor, that the meeting may be &s;atisfied there has been no unprofitable delay.</P>
<P>That the bu&s;ine&s;s from preparative to monthly, and from monthly to quarterly meetings, be read in the re&s;pective meet|ings to which they are forwarded, together with the minutes of the preceding monthly or quarterly, and the extracts from &s;uperior meetings, at the opening of each meeting.</P>
<P>That minutes or due entries be made, in every month|ly and quarterly meeting, of all &s;uch matters as come before them and are determined, or that are or may be removed to the quarterly or yearly meeting;</P>
<P>And that the minutes and reports which go from inferior to &s;uperior meetings, be &s;igned by their re&s;pective clerks.</P>
<P>Where any are under dealing, they are not to be permitted to &s;it in any of our meetings for di&s;cipline, except de&s;ired by &s;uch meeting.</P>
<P>That each monthly meeting appoint a Trea&s;urer, and have
<PB N="8" REF="037474_0012_100D1289C1A53420">
a collection quarterly, to provide for the relief of the nece&s;&s;i|tous, and other purpo&s;es of the meeting.</P>
<P>Every particular meeting for wor&s;hip &s;hould be a prepara|tive meeting, where there is a probability of their being re|putably &s;upported.</P>
<P>And in ca&s;es where it may appear to be not quite &s;afe for a preparative meeting to be held, and yet a meeting for wor|&s;hip is allowed, it is the &s;en&s;e of this meeting, that in &s;uch ca&s;es, it will generally be advi&s;able, and tend to the help and &s;trength of the members con&s;tituting the &s;ame, that a prepa|rative meeting be al&s;o allowed, under the particular &s;uperin|tendance of a &s;uitable committee of men and women friends, to &s;it with them in conducting the bu&s;ine&s;s thereof (as often as well may be) and which ought to be at lea&s;t once in three months.</P>
<P>That &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s as comes from per&s;ons not of our &s;ocie|ty, be brought to the preparative meeting by the over&s;eers.</P>
<P>And it is the earne&s;t de&s;ire of this meeting, that our quar|terly meetings, in their collective capacity, wait for the ari|&s;ing of the Spirit of Truth, whereby they may be enabled to admini&s;ter &s;uch advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the monthly meetings as circum&s;tances may from time to time call for, in order that our Chri&s;tian Di&s;cipline may be &s;upported agreeably to the de&s;ign of its in&s;titution: That the nece&s;&s;ity of a more clo&s;e attention to the tenor and &s;pirit thereof, may be impre&s;|&s;ed on our monthly meetings, on who&s;e care and concern for the &s;upport and maintenance of the whole&s;ome regulations therein recommended, for general u&s;e and practice, much depends. It is therefore earne&s;tly de&s;ired, that this watchful care may be maintained, le&s;t a gradual &s;liding therefrom take place, and weakne&s;s en&s;ue.&mdash;Y. M. 1789.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="037474_0013_100D128C681DFD30" MS="y">Our quarterly, monthly and preparative meetings are ad|vi&s;ed to be careful how they employ, in the &s;ervice of &s;ociety, &s;uch as give way to &s;leeping in meetings.</P>
<P>It is further earne&s;tly de&s;ired, that repre&s;entatives weighti|ly con&s;ider the importance of their appointment, and endea|vour to keep under a lively &s;en&s;e of the intere&s;ting concerns which have exerci&s;ed the yearly meeting, and thereby be enabled to accompany them to our &s;ubordinate meetings, with &s;uch remarks as truth may authorize. Y. M. 1790.</P>
<P>With &s;olicitude of heart we de&s;ire to impre&s;s the minds of all concerned and active members in their &s;everal meetings, to con&s;ider the need there is of faithfulne&s;s on their parts, in di&s;charging the tru&s;t committed to them, with great dili|gence and circum&s;pection; for our minds have been &s;eized with jealou&s;y, le&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould &s;tand as watchmen on the walls, are too much concerned to &s;eek their own things, and not the things that are Je&s;us Chri&s;t's; hence weakne&s;s en&s;ues, and, in&s;tead of watching and caring for the flock, we fear &s;ome of tho&s;e may become as &s;tumbling-blocks in the way of others.</P>
<P>An exerci&s;ing concern has al&s;o been witne&s;&s;ed, le&s;t the pro|gre&s;s of truth in our religious &s;ociety be hindered, through un&s;avoury and injudicious appointments to &s;ervices in the church; it is therefore earne&s;tly reque&s;ted, that friends be weighty in their nomination, as the right maintaining our Chri&s;tian Di&s;cipline, in its various branches, very much de|pends on a &s;olemn attention to the pointings of be&s;t wi&s;dom therein.

<P>And in ca&s;es where the intended vi&s;it is to parts beyond &s;ea&mdash;As the mo&s;t weighty, clear, and deliberate evidence &s;hould be obtained in the undertaking, it is concluded that &s;uch concern, with the certificate of the monthly and en|dor&s;ement of the quarterly meeting, &s;hould be laid before the yearly meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, for their approba|tion, and if obtained, a certificate thereof be &s;igned by the clerk.</P>
<P>And with re&s;pect to vi&s;iting families&mdash;although it is a &s;er|vice, that, when performed under right direction, frequent|ly proves u&s;efully in&s;tructive and beneficial, yet it requires deliberate and weighty con&s;ideration; therefore, for the en|couragement and &s;trengthening mini&s;ters in right movements therein, it is advi&s;ed, that tho&s;e who feel it a duty to make a pretty general vi&s;it of this kind, even in the monthly meet|ing to which they belong, that they have the concurrence thereof, and if the pro&s;pect extends to the families in ano|ther monthly meeting, the concurrence to be expre&s;&s;ed by minute.</P>

<P>It is al&s;o de&s;ired, that friends be careful not to re|ceive friends travelling in the mini&s;try without certificates, or other nece&s;&s;ary recommendation. And that monthly meetings take care, that certificates or minutes given to any friend be, upon the return of &s;uch friend, &s;ea&s;onably re|turned.</P>

But as it is po&s;&s;ible, that ca|&s;es may occur, in which &s;uch an improper u&s;e may be made of this tender care towards tho&s;e of the mini&s;try, that by &s;ome unauthorized publick appearance, the &s;olemnity of the meeting may materially &s;uffer; it is therefore judged advi&s;able that a di&s;cretionary care be ve&s;ted in mini&s;ters and elders, in ca&s;es where it appears there is a nece&s;&s;ity for it, tenderly to intimate a de&s;ire for the pre&s;ervation of quiet, and that a &s;uitable opportunity be taken by the elders with &s;uch per&s;on who hath thus given occa&s;ion of con|cern, and advice and coun&s;el be given, as may appear ne|ce&s;&s;ary. And in this and other ca&s;es where mini&s;ters give cau&s;e of unea&s;ine&s;s or di&s;&s;atisfaction to friends, it is de&s;ir|ed that elders take due care to admoni&s;h and advi&s;e &s;uch &s;ea&s;onably, and if their advice has not the de&s;ired effect, that they lay the ca&s;e before the preparative meeting of mini&s;|ters

<P>As friends, and the meetings belonging to this yearly meeting, are widely extended, and occa&s;ions offer for com|mittees of the yearly meeting to vi&s;it the meetings in the different quarters, and that &s;ome friend of the mini&s;try on &s;uch appointments, may, when remote from home, have a pro&s;pect of religious duty to appoint &s;ome meetings in par|ticular places, it is therefore concluded that in &s;uch ca&s;es, &s;uch friend have liberty to di&s;clo&s;e the concern to friends of the committee who are in company, and &s;uch mini&s;ters and elders, or other concerned friends as are in the neigh|bourhood where they are, and with their concurrence, pro|ceed in appointing a few meetings agreeable to &s;uch pro&s;|pect.</P>

<P>IT is de&s;ired that the &s;ubject of appointing elders engage the weighty care and attention of the preparative meeting of mini&s;ters and elders; and when they apprehend a friend &s;o far advanced in religious experience, and qualified for the weighty tru&s;t of an elder in the church, that it may be &s;afe and u&s;eful for &s;uch friend to be appointed to that &s;tation, that they propo&s;e the &s;ame to the con&s;ideration of the monthly meeting, and, if approved by &s;aid meeting, &s;uch friend to be con&s;idered a member of the meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, and the quarterly meeting of mini&s;ters and elders is to be informed of &s;uch appointment through the &s;aid preparative meeting.</P>
<P>A renewed con&s;ideration of the &s;ubject re&s;pecting elders removing, and retaining their &s;tation as elders in the month|ly meeting to which they remove, again engaged the &s;olid attention of the meeting, and, after a deliberate review of the &s;ubject, it is the judgment of this meeting, that the right of appointing in that ca&s;e &s;hould not in future conti|nue a friend in that &s;tation on his removing into the com|pa&s;s of another monthly meeting.

<P>And it is the de&s;ire of this meeting, that preparative meet|ings of mini&s;ters and elders have a watchful care over the members of their meeting.

<HEAD>MARRIAGES.</HEAD>
<P>CONCERNING the manner of proceeding in marriage, it is advi&s;ed, that no young per&s;ons, who have parents or guardians, make propo&s;als of marriage with each other, until the con&s;ent of &s;uch parents or guardians be obtained.</P>
<P>That all, according to our u&s;ual cu&s;tom, do offer or pro|po&s;e their marriage to two monthly meetings, and that the &s;econd time be to the next &s;ucce&s;&s;ive meeting, unle&s;s &s;ickne&s;s or other material cau&s;e prevent. At the fir&s;t meeting, if no rea&s;on appear to the contrary, the appearance would be mi|nuted, and inquiry made concerning con&s;ent of parents or guardians, if either have any, which con&s;ent ought always to be &s;ignified by &s;uch parents or guardians to the monthly meeting, either per&s;onally or in writing; and if the man be|long to the &s;ame meeting, two friends are to be then ap|pointed to inquire into his clearne&s;s for proceeding in &s;uch marriage; and if there is i&s;&s;ue by a former hu&s;band, to &s;ee that the children's rights are duly attended to, and make re|port to the next meeting. And the proper care is previou&s;ly to be taken by women friends concerning the woman. And if either of the parties be from another country, or belong to another monthly meeting, let inquiry be then made, for a certificate from &s;uch meeting, and where none is produced, let the parties be informed, that the marriage cannot pa&s;s, or be allowed without one, which &s;hall certify their clearne&s;s from all others in re&s;pect of marriage, or any other engage|ment that way. But if the meeting he belongs to be within &s;uch di&s;tance as that it may probably be obtained, &s;o as to

<P>It it further pre&s;&s;ed and advi&s;ed, that the &s;aid marriage be accompli&s;hed decently, gravely and weightily; and that the parties them&s;elves, their parents, and others concerned, do take care, at the hou&s;es, or places where they go or are after the meeting is over, that no reproach ari&s;e, or occa&s;ion of offence be given, by any intemperance, or immoderate fea&s;t|ing or drinking, or by any un&s;eemly or wanton di&s;cour&s;e or actions; but that all behave with &s;uch mode&s;ty and &s;obriety as becomes a people fearing God: and in order thereto, and for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e immediately concerned, let there be two men and two women friends appointed by the monthly meeting, to attend the marriage both at the meeting and place of entertainment after, who are to take care, as much as in them lies, that all be done, and all behave, as is above advi&s;ed; and that the company retire in &s;ea&s;onable time. And if by them, or any other friend, any thing to the con|trary is ob&s;erved, they ought, as &s;peedily as they convenient|ly can, to take &s;uch a&s;ide, who make any breach upon good order, and, in brotherly love, tenderly admoni&s;h them to a better behaviour.

<P>When over&s;eers, or other friends, know that any intend to offer propo&s;als of marriage to the monthly meeting, which is manife&s;t to them cannot pa&s;s, either for want of a certifi|cate, or any other apparent cau&s;e, they ought to advi&s;e them not to give them&s;elves or the meeting unnece&s;&s;ary trouble, yet not &s;o as to prevent or forbid them, if the parties conti|nue de&s;irous notwith&s;tanding to lay their propo&s;als before the meeting.</P>

<P>And when any who have married out, do, from a religious &s;en&s;ibility, witne&s;s an exerci&s;e of mind, that induces a de&s;ire for reconciliation with the body, let no di&s;couragements be given, by the requi&s;ition of unnece&s;&s;ary expre&s;&s;ions in an ac|knowledgment, that would not accord with that tender re|gard for the pre&s;ervation of harmony, &s;o precious and nece&s;|&s;ary to be pre&s;erved between hu&s;band and wife.</P>
<P>And it is concluded, if any fir&s;t cou&s;ins join in marriage, they are to be di&s;owned without dealing; yet over&s;eers and other concerned friends ought to con&s;ider it their duty, when they hear of any &s;uch keeping company on that account, or of a conduct likely to lead thereto, timely to treat with them, and endeavour to convince them of the incon&s;i&s;tency of &s;uch marriages, and the danger there is in going counter to the &s;olid &s;en&s;e and judgment of the body.</P>

<P>This meeting, being tender in re&s;pect to marriages, advi&s;es that no mi&s;conduct be brought forward again&s;t any per&s;on at the time of their propo&s;ing their marriage, or till the mar|riage is accompli&s;hed, as it is out of order, and ought to be di&s;couraged; but this is not to affect the report re&s;pecting the clearne&s;s from others on account of marriage.</P>
<P>It is advi&s;ed, that no widower or widow make or admit propo&s;als of marriage within one year after the decea&s;e of hu&s;band or wife; an earlier procedure therein being thought over ha&s;ty and unbecoming.

<HEAD>REMOVALS AND CERTIFICATES.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the pre&s;ervation of friends from wounding them|&s;elves and families, or the body, by injudicious remov|als, we do advi&s;e, that, when any friends have thoughts of removing, they be careful not to let wrong motives influence their conclu&s;ions; but in a timely manner, (that is, before &s;uch &s;teps are taken as may clo&s;e the way to their taking the advice of their friends) acquaint the monthly meeting where|to they belong, or at lea&s;t the over&s;eers of the preparative meeting, and &s;uch other friends as the over&s;eers may a&s;k to unite with them in coun&s;el in the ca&s;e, in order for their brotherly advice on the propriety of &s;uch their propo&s;ed re|moval; for want of which, &s;ome have &s;uffered lo&s;s, both in their temporal and &s;piritual concerns, and we believe there|by hurt the youth of their families. And if no material objection appear again&s;t it, they ought to have a certificate of their life, conver&s;ation and circum&s;tances, according to truth and ju&s;tice, to be produced to the monthly meeting where they are going to re&s;ide. And the inquiry re&s;pecting outward affairs being &s;ettled, ought not to be confined to the monthly meeting in which the per&s;on propo&s;ing to remove re&s;ides, if there is rea&s;on to believe they are not &s;ettled in other places. And elders, over&s;eers, and other concerned friends, when they hear of any friend inclining to remove, are to con&s;ider it as their duty, in brotherly love, to advi&s;e &s;uch to ob&s;erve the foregoing directions.</P>
<P>And when a certificate of removal, from one monthly meeting to another, is received by the meeting to which it

<P>IT is evident, that the &s;pirit of truth, where it is received, and given way to, brings into &s;uch a liberty and freedom of &s;pirit, that tho&s;e who keep under the influence of it, are not in bondage to the &s;pirit of this world; an attention to the precious influence thereof, occa&s;ioned our primitive friends to be remarkable for their uprightne&s;s and hone&s;ty in their commerce and conver&s;e, and very exact in performing their promi&s;es, without eva&s;ive excu&s;es.</P>
<P>And a concern is witne&s;&s;ed, that friends be earne&s;tly en|gaged to &s;eek after divine coun&s;el in all their movements; their temporal concerns will thereby be circum&s;cribed within the bounds of &s;afety; a want of a due and watchful care therein, has been the cau&s;e of many being drawn from the limits of truth, into a worldly &s;pirit and di&s;po&s;ition, which hath tended to di&s;qualify them for tho&s;e &s;ervices in &s;ociety they were graciou&s;ly de&s;igned for, and they have gradually become barren, and unfruitful of good, and pierced them|&s;elves through with many &s;orrows.</P>
<P>It is therefore advi&s;ed, that friends be very cautious and guarded, how they go from &s;uch hone&s;t and lawful employ|ments as they well under&s;tand, and are able to manage. And that they endeavour to content them&s;elves with &s;uch a plain way of living, as is mo&s;t agreeable to the &s;elf-denying principle of truth which we profe&s;s, and which is mo&s;t con|ducive to that tranquillity of mind requi&s;ite to a religious conduct through this world.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, earne&s;tly recommended to tho&s;e who en|gage
<PB N="60" REF="037474_0041_100D12CE48D36640">
in commerce particularly, and in all other concerns, clo&s;ely to attend to the guidance of the precious principle of light and truth in the heart, that they may witne&s;s their views, and movements, circum&s;cribed, and their minds guarded again&s;t an inordinate pur&s;uit after the accumulation of wealth; again&s;t unduly entering into concerns, that de|pend much upon the uncertain probabilities of hazardous enterpri&s;es; and more e&s;pecially again&s;t launching into bu&s;i|ne&s;s upon &s;uch credit, as their profe&s;&s;ion of the truth may have given them, and more at the hazard of others property than their own. And that all friends be careful of entering into ha&s;ty engagements; but when they give their words, that they as carefully abide by and perform them, to the utmo&s;t of their power, the reputation truth gives them be|ing otherwi&s;e wounded.</P>
<P>And let all among&s;t us be cautioned, to con&s;ider well the ground on which they become endor&s;ers, or joint-&s;ecurities, le&s;t, for want of due con&s;ideration, any involve them&s;elves and families into ruinous circum&s;tances, and ri&s;k their own peace of mind. And if any among&s;t us find them&s;elves em|barra&s;&s;ed, and not likely to be able to comply with their con|tracts, it is advi&s;ed, that &s;uch di&s;clo&s;e their circum&s;tances to &s;ome judicious friends, and, if it appears nece&s;&s;ary, call their creditors together, and &s;ea&s;onably &s;tate their &s;ituation, and then be particular in &s;uch &s;ituations, to take the coun&s;el of the over&s;eers, and &s;uch other judicious friends as they may think proper to call in, relative to a &s;ettlement of their affairs, agreeable to the principles of ju&s;tice and equity.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o advi&s;ed, that over&s;eers coun&s;el &s;uch as give occa|&s;ion to &s;u&s;pect, that they are &s;o declining in their worldly circum&s;tances, as to be likely to bring reproach on our chri&s;|tian profe&s;&s;ion, by falling &s;hort of hone&s;tly di&s;charging their
<PB N="61" REF="037474_0042_100D12D1221D6DD0">
contracts, to the injury of their ju&s;t creditors. And that all concerned in trade, keep their accounts in &s;uch a clear and accurate manner, that, in ca&s;es of failure, their creditors may &s;ee how the deficiency has happened. Tho&s;e friends who may be appointed by monthly meetings to vi&s;it tho&s;e who have failed, &s;hould always make due inquiry how they have acted in the above re&s;pects, and report to the monthly meeting.</P>
<P>And it is al&s;o advi&s;ed, that friends be cautious how they receive collections or beque&s;ts, for the u&s;e of the poor or other purpo&s;es of &s;ociety, of per&s;ons who have fallen &s;hort of the payment of their ju&s;t debts, though legally di&s;charged by the voluntary act of their creditors; for until &s;uch per|&s;ons have &s;atisfied their creditors, their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions cannot in equity be called their own. And when any failures of this kind do occur, and &s;uch decline making farther payments towards the remaining balances of their ju&s;t debts, when of ability &s;o to do, monthly meetings &s;hould be informed there|of, and inquire into the cau&s;e, and if after a tender and brotherly examination, it &s;hould appear, that their circum|&s;tances are &s;uch as to render it clearly advi&s;able, that a farther payment &s;hould be offered to the creditors; or that a &s;tate of the debtor's affairs &s;hould be laid before the creditors, and &s;ubmitted to them, whether a farther payment &s;hould be made at that time, or referred to a farther day, let advice to the individual be given accordingly. And where monthly meetings di&s;cover, in any who have fallen &s;hort of the pay|ment of their ju&s;t debts, a conduct, attended with circum|&s;tances, that bring a reproach on our religious &s;ociety, &s;uch offenders &s;hould, after due labour extended, be te&s;tified again&s;t, unle&s;s they condemn their mi&s;conduct in a &s;atisfac|tory manner. And it is advi&s;ed, that where friends accept

the office of tru&s;tee or a&s;&s;ignee, they be active in collect|ing the effects of the e&s;tate, and punctual in making &s;peedy di&s;tribution</P>
<P>The danger and inconveniences which have frequently aro&s;e from partner&s;hips in trade between friends and others who are not members of our &s;ociety, having in divers in|&s;tances been very apparent, and apprehending &s;ome have &s;u&s;tained a lo&s;s in their religious progre&s;s by a connection of that kind, we feel de&s;irous, that, when any in profe&s;&s;ion with us are about forming connections in bu&s;ine&s;s, they may duly con&s;ider the &s;ubject, and keep in view the propriety and greater &s;afety of confining their pro&s;pects to tho&s;e who are in member&s;hip with us. And when any do engage, and become a partner in commercial concerns with tho&s;e not of our &s;oci|ety, and it &s;hould &s;o happen, through a failure of engage|ments, or payment of ju&s;t debts in &s;ea&s;on, on the part of the &s;aid partner&s;hip, as to give rea&s;onable occa&s;ion for a legal procedure at law, that, in that ca&s;e, a creditor, who may be a member of our &s;ociety, may be at liberty to proceed ac|cordingly&mdash;it appearing to us very improper that the due cour&s;e of ju&s;tice &s;hould be ob&s;tructed by any of our mem|bers connecting them&s;elves with tho&s;e not in profe&s;&s;ion with us.</P>

<P>And that the importance of that chri&s;tian te&s;timony, borne by our predece&s;&s;ors in this ca&s;e, may be the more clearly di&s;|cerned, the following is recommended to &s;erious con&s;idera|tion:</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="explanation">
<HEAD>A brief account of the origin of the names of &s;ome months of the year, and of all the days of the week, now cu&s;toma|rily and commonly u&s;ed.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. January was &s;o called from Janus, an ancient king of Italy, whom heatheni&s;h &s;uper&s;tition had deified, to whom a temple was built and this month dedicated.</P>
<P N="2">II. February was &s;o called from Februa, a word denoting purgation by &s;acrifices; it being u&s;ual in this month for the prie&s;ts of the heathen god Pan to offer &s;acrifices, and perform certain rites, conducing, as was &s;uppo&s;ed, to the clean&s;ing or purgation of the people.</P>
<P N="3">III. March was &s;o denominated from Mars, feigned to be the god of war, whom Romulus, founder of the Roman em|pire, pretended to be his father.</P>
<P N="4">IV. April is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to derive its name from the Greek appellation of Venus, an imaginary godde&s;s, wor|&s;hipped by the Romans.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="74" REF="037474_0049_100D12DFF69874A8">V. May is &s;aid to have been &s;o called from Maia, the mo|ther of Mercury, another of their pretended ethnic deities, to whom in this month they paid their devotions.</P>
<P N="6">VI. June is &s;aid to take its name from Juno, one of the &s;uppo&s;ed godde&s;&s;es of the heathen.</P>
<P N="7">VII. July, &s;o called from Julius Cae&s;ar, one of the Roman emperors, who gave his name to this month, which before was called Quintilis or the fifth.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Augu&s;t, &s;o named in honour of Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar, another of the Roman emperors; this month before was cal|led Sextilis or the &s;ixth.</P>
<P>The other four months, namely, September, October, No|vember and December, &s;till retain their numerical Latin names, which, according to the late regulation of the calen|dar, will for the future be improperly applied. However, from the continued u&s;e of them hitherto, as well as from the practice of the Jews before the Babyloni&s;h captivity, it &s;eemeth highly probable that the method of di&s;tingui&s;hing the months by their numerical order only, was the mo&s;t ancient, as it is the mo&s;t plain, &s;imple and rational.</P>
<P>As the idolatrous Romans thus gave names to &s;everal of the months, in honour of their pretended deities: &s;o the like idolatry prevailing among our Saxon ance&s;tors, induced them to call the days of the week by the name of the idol which on that day they peculiarly wor&s;hipped.&mdash;Hence,</P>
<P>The fir&s;t day of the week they called Sunday, from their accu&s;tomary adoration of the &s;un on that day.</P>
<P>The &s;econd day of the week they called Monday, from their u&s;ual cu&s;tom of wor&s;hipping the moon on that day.</P>
<P>The third day of the week they named Tue&s;day, in ho|nour of one of their idols called Tui&s;co.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="037474_0050_100D12E268F65FB8">The fourth day of the week was called Wedne&s;day, from the appellation of Woden, another of their idols.</P>
<P>The fifth day of the week was called Thur&s;day, from the name of an idol called Thor, to whom they paid their de|votion on that day.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth day of the week was termed Friday, from the name of Friga, an imaginary godde&s;s, by them wor&s;hipped.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh day they &s;tiled Saturday, as is &s;uppo&s;ed from Saturn, or Seater, by them then wor&s;hipped.</P>
<P>Seeing, therefore, that the&s;e appellations and names of days, months and times, are of an idolatrous or &s;uper&s;titious original, contrary to the divine command, <Q>make no men|tion of the names of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth,</Q> Exod. xxiii. 13,&mdash;the practice of good and holy men in former ages, and repugnant to the chri&s;tian te&s;|timony, borne by our faithful friends and predece&s;&s;ors in the truth, for the &s;ake of which they patiently endured many revilings; let neither the reproach of &s;ingularity, nor the &s;pecious rea&s;onings of &s;uch as would evade the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, turn any a&s;ide from the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel, nor di&s;cou|rage from keeping to the language of truth, in denominating the months and days according to the plain and &s;criptural way of expre&s;&s;ion, thereby following the example of our worthy elders, and coming up in a noble and honourable te&s;timony again&s;t tho&s;e and all other remains of idolatry and &s;uper&s;tition. E. D.</P>
<P>Neither can we conform to the cu&s;tom of illuminating our hou&s;es, or doing any act as a mark of rejoicing for victory in war&mdash;or in other re&s;pects comply with the ordinances of man relative to fa&s;t-days, or tho&s;e appointed for publick thank&s;giving or rejoicing.</P>

<P>The report received the &s;olid deliberation of the meeting, and a free communication of &s;entiments evidenced a full united concurrence with the report of the committee&mdash;and it is earne&s;tly recommended to the care and attention of our monthly meetings, and our meeting for &s;ufferings is de&s;ired

<P>AS much depends on the example and conduct of mini|&s;ters and elders, meetings have been e&s;tabli&s;hed among them, for the purpo&s;e of in&s;pecting into the &s;tate of that part of the body, whether all are pre&s;erved in an exemplary walking an&s;werable to their &s;tation, and where advice, caution and en|couragement may be admini&s;tered for the help and &s;trength|ening one of another, as in the wi&s;dom of truth may appear nece&s;&s;ary; for the more proper and u&s;eful proceeding where|in, the following queries are recommended to be read and an&s;wered therein:</P>
<P N="1">I. Are mini&s;ters and elders diligent in attending meetings for wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline, and careful in bringing their fa|milies with them?</P>
<P N="2">II. Are they careful to labour hone&s;tly to maintain our Chri&s;tian di&s;cipline in every part, and not &s;creen their own families from the operation thereof?</P>
<P N="3">III. Are mini&s;ters careful to mini&s;ter in the ability which truth gives; to avoid tones, unbecoming ge&s;tures, and en|larging their te&s;timonies &s;o far as to become burden&s;ome?</P>
<P N="4">IV. Are the elders careful to encourage tho&s;e who are young in the mini&s;try in the right line, and di&s;courage a forward &s;pirit in any who run into words without life and power?</P>
<P N="5">V. Are there any who travel abroad and appoint meetings that are not recommended as mini&s;ters; or do any recom|mended mini&s;ters appoint meetings contrary to our di&s;ci|pline?</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="132" REF="037474_0081_100D13288A5E82B0">VI. Are mini&s;ters and elders in love and unity one with another, and with the meetings whereunto they belong?</P>
<P>And let mini&s;ters and elders dwell in that life which gives ability to labour &s;ucce&s;sfully in the church of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Which meetings are to be held in the following manner, viz.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ters and elders of each monthly meeting, are to meet once in three months, and, after &s;ome time &s;pent in &s;olid retirement, to proceed to read and prepare an&s;wers to the queries, &s;uitable to the &s;tate of the members thereof; from which preparative meeting a &s;uitable number of friends are to be appointed as repre&s;entatives to attend the quarterly meeting of mini&s;ters and elders with &s;aid an&s;wers, and &s;uch other bu&s;ine&s;s as the preparative meeting may direct. The quarterly is compo&s;ed of all the preparative meetings of mi|ni&s;ters and elders within the quarter, where the queries, with the an&s;wers from the preparatives, are to be read, and the import of tho&s;e an&s;wers to be entered on their minutes, and a copy thereof &s;ent by their repre&s;entatives to the yearly meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, containing a ju&s;t account of the &s;tate of the meetings from which they are &s;ent; by which an opportunity may be given for &s;uitable advice to be ad|mini&s;tered by that meeting, which is held on the &s;eventh day of the week preceding the yearly meeting of di&s;cipline, beginning at the tenth hour; where a &s;uitable number of elders are to be appointed, to the over&s;ight of the meetings for wor&s;hip during the yearly meeting, to advi&s;e as they find occa&s;ion, and make &s;uch report to the adjournments of the meeting as they may &s;ee nece&s;&s;ary; and the like appointment to be made by the quarterly meetings of mini&s;ters and elders,
<PB N="133" REF="037474_0082_100CDAF28722E398">
to the over&s;ight of the publick meetings during the time of the quarterly meetings.</P>
<P>And &s;aid meetings of mini&s;ters and elders are not in any|wi&s;e to interfere with any part of the exerci&s;e of the di&s;ci|pline of the church belonging to the yearly, or any &s;ubordi|nate meeting for di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>And as the fountain of all good is, from time to time, opening among us the &s;pring of living mini&s;try, it is greatly de&s;ired, that mini&s;ters and elders may &s;o dwell under the di|vine influence, as to be able to di&s;cover, what offering in come from the right &s;pring, and what do nor, and thereby be qualified to be as nur&s;ing fathers, and nur&s;ing mothers, to &s;uch that are young in the mini&s;try; and may with all <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">re and diligence advi&s;e, caution and encourage, with gentlene&s;s and wi&s;dom, as occa&s;ion may require.</P>

<HEAD>MEETING FOR SUFFERINGS.</HEAD>
<P>THE meeting for &s;ufferings was appointed by the yearly meeting in 1758, and the year following the &s;ubject more fully engaging attention, the meeting for &s;ufferings was e&s;tabli&s;hment, and the &s;ervices thereof more fully &s;tated, as ap|pears by the following minute, viz.</P>
<P>The meeting for &s;ufferings are to take under their con&s;i|deration the ca&s;es of any of our brethren who are &s;ubjected to &s;ufferings for the te&s;timony of truth, and repre&s;ent &s;uch ca&s;es as they may think proper to tho&s;e in authority, in order to obtain redre&s;s; to pay attention to any bills that may be brought forward in the legi&s;lature that may likely affect our religious te&s;timony, and to make application when they may judge proper. The &s;aid meeting for &s;ufferings is to be con&s;idered as repre&s;entatives on behalf of the yearly meeting, and to appear in any matter where the intere&s;t and reputa|tion of truth may render it nece&s;&s;ary; and as there may be &s;ometimes a nece&s;&s;ary expen&s;e attending the tran&s;action of &s;ome part of their bu&s;ine&s;s, the trea&s;urer is reque&s;ted to fur|ni&s;h the &s;aid meeting with money nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch &s;er|vices. 1759.</P>
<P>It is concluded, that the meeting for &s;ufferings have liberty to take into con&s;ideration the purcha&s;ing and di&s;tributing &s;ome u&s;eful books among&s;t friends and others, and act in matters of that nature according as to them may appear mo&s;t likely to promote the principles of truth, and our Chri&s;tian te&s;timony. 1783.</P>
<P>This meeting con&s;titutes the meeting for &s;ufferings over|&s;eers

<P>It appears by the minutes of the yearly meeting in 1799, that a new appointment of the meeting for &s;ufferings took place, to be con&s;tituted in the following manner, viz. That the yearly meeting appoint twenty-four friends for that pur|po&s;e, and that each quarter appoint four; that tho&s;e appoint|ed in the quarterly meeting of We&s;tbury and Purcha&s;e, unite with tho&s;e appointed by the yearly meeting in con&s;tituting the meeting for &s;ufferings; and that tho&s;e appointed by the quarterly meetings of Nine-Partners and Ea&s;ton, be con&s;ider|ed as corre&s;ponding members with the &s;aid meeting, and to attend as members thereof, as often as their di&s;tant &s;ituation may permit, and to them appears right and con&s;i&s;tent; and that they pay particular attention to matters that may be of a &s;uffering nature, or concern the meeting for &s;ufferings; to give timely notice of all &s;uch ca&s;es to that meetings; and that in all matters of moment, one or more of their number attend the meeting for &s;ufferings therewith, if rea&s;onably in their power. And the &s;aid meeting for &s;ufferings are re|que&s;ted to attend to the bu&s;ine&s;s which may come before them agreeable to former in&s;tructions, and the principles upon which that meeting was founded&mdash;To meet at the time and place the late meeting for &s;ufferings adjourned to, and to take up and pur&s;ue the bu&s;ine&s;s left on the minutes of that meeting.</P>

<HEAD>MEETING-HOUSES AND GROUND.</HEAD>
<P>IT is recommended to the quarterly and monthly meetings to make timely and careful in&s;pection into the &s;ituation of the titles of meeting-hou&s;es, burial-ground, and other e&s;tates which have been ve&s;ted in tru&s;tees, and by them held for the u&s;e and benefit of the &s;ociety at large, or of any of tho&s;e meetings, &s;o that, if it &s;hould appear needful by the death of any &s;uch tru&s;tees or otherwi&s;e, due and &s;ea&s;onable care may be taken to appoint &s;ome others to the tru&s;t, that friends may avoid future difficulties, and the ri&s;k of being deprived of &s;uch e&s;tates. And it is further recommended, that quarterly and monthly meetings re&s;pectively, as the ca&s;e may require, keep exact records of all &s;uch tru&s;ts and con|veyances; and al&s;o that a clear and regular account be kept by each re&s;pective meeting of the place where, and the per|&s;ons with whom the papers, minutes and records, belonging to our religious &s;ociety, are from time to time depo&s;ited, wherein due care &s;hould be taken to lodge them with &s;uit|able friends.
