<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honor to inform Congre&s;s, that I arrived here ye&s;terday about twelve o'clock, on my return from Hartford. Some hours previous to my arrival Major Ge|neral Arnold went from his quarters, which were this place, and, as it was &s;uppo&s;ed, over the river to the garri&s;on at We&s;t Point, whither I proceeded my&s;elf, in order to vi&s;it the po&s;t. I found General Arnold had not been there during the day, and on my return to his quarters he was &s;till ab&s;ent. In the mean time, a packet had arrived from Lieut. Colonel Jame&s;on, announcing the capture of a John Ander&s;on, who was endeavouring to go to New-York with &s;everal intere&s;ting and important papers, all in the hand writing of General Arnold. This was al&s;o accom|panied with a letter from the pri&s;oner, avowing him&s;elf to be Major John Andr&eacute;, Adjutant General to the Briti&s;h army, relating the manner of his capture, and endeavour|ing to &s;hew that he did not come under the de&s;cription of a <HI>&s;py.</HI> From the&s;e &s;everal circum&s;tances, and informa|tion that the General &s;eemed to be thrown into &s;ome de|gree of agitation, on receiving a letter a little time before he went from his quarters, I was led to conclude imme|diately that he had heard of Major Andr&eacute;'s captivity, and that he would, if po&s;&s;ible, e&s;cape to the enemy, and accord|ingly took &s;uch mea&s;ures as appeared the mo&s;t probable to apprehend him. But he had embarked in a barge and proceeded down the river, under a flag, to the Vulture
<PB N="4" REF="017043_0004_0FA25CDCA5DA1810" MS="y">
&s;hip of war, which lay at &s;ome miles below Stoney and Verplank's Points. He wrote me a letter after he got on board. Major Andr&eacute; is not arrived yet, but I hope he is &s;ecure, and that he will be here to-day. I have been and am taking precautions, which I tru&s;t will prove effectual to prevent the important con&s;equences which this conduct, on the part of General Arnold, was intended to produce. I do not know the party that took Major Andr&eacute;, but it is &s;aid that it con&s;i&s;ted only of a few militia, who acted in &s;uch a manner upon the occa&s;ion, as does them the highe&s;t honor, and proves them to be men of great virtue. As &s;oon as I know their names, I &s;hall take plea&s;ure in tran&s;|mitting them to Congre&s;s.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Salem, <DATE>24th Sept. 1780.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>What I have as yet &s;aid concerning my&s;elf, was in the ju&s;tifiable attempt to be extricated; I am too little accu&s;|tomed to duplicity to have &s;ucceeded.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I beg your Excellency will be per&s;uaded, that no alter|ation in the temper of my mind, or apprehen&s;ion for my &s;afety, induces me to take the &s;tep of addre&s;&s;ing you, but that it is to &s;ecure my&s;elf from an imputation of having a&s;&s;umed a mean character for treacherous purpo&s;es or &s;elf intere&s;t. A conduct incompatible with the principles that actuated me, as well as with my condition in life.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is to vindicate my fame that I &s;peak and not to &s;o|licit &s;ecurity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The per&s;on in your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is Major John Andre, Adjutant General to the Briti&s;h army.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The influence of one commander in the army of his adver&s;ary is an advantage taken in war. A corre&s;pon|dence for this purpo&s;e I held; as confidential (in the pre|&s;ent in&s;tance) with his Excellency Sir Henry Clinton.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To favour it, I agreed to meet upon ground not within po&s;ts of either army, a per&s;on who was to give me intelligence; I came up in the Vulture man of war
<PB N="19" REF="017043_0007_0FA25CDFA73A82D0">
for this effect, and was fetched by a boat from the &s;hore to the beach: Being there I was told that the approach of day would prevent my return, and that I mu&s;t be concealed until the next night. I was in my regimentals and had fairly ri&s;ked my per&s;on.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Again&s;t my &s;tipulation, my intention and without, my knowledge before hand, I was conducted within one of your po&s;ts. Your Excellency may conceive my &s;en&s;ation on this occa&s;ion and will imagine how much more I mu&s;t have been affected, by a refu&s;al to reconduct me back the next night as I had been brought. Thus become a pri&s;oner I had to concert my e&s;cape.</HI> I quitted my uni|form <HI>and was pa&s;&s;ed another way in the night without the American po&s;ts to neutral ground, and informed I was beyond all armed parties and left to pre&s;s for New-York. I was taken at Tarry Town by &s;ome volanteers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thus as I have had the honor to relate was I betrayed (being Adjutant General of the Briti&s;h army) into the vile condition of an enemy in di&s;gui&s;e within your po&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Having avowed my&s;elf a Briti&s;h officer I have nothing to reveal but what relates to my&s;elf, which is true on the honour of an officer and a gentleman.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The reque&s;t I have to make your Excellency, and I am con&s;cious I addre&s;s my&s;elf well, is, that in any rigour policy may dictate, a decency of conduct towards me may mark, that though unfortunate I am branded with no|thing di&s;honourable, as no motive could be mine but the &s;ervice of my king, and as I was involuntarily an impo&s;tor.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Another reque&s;t is, that I may be permitted to write an open letter to Sir Henry Clinton and another to a friend for cloaths and linen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I take the liberty to mention the condition of &s;ome gentlemen at Charles-Town, who being either on parole or under protection, were engaged in a con&s;piracy again&s;t us. Though their &s;ituation is not &s;imilar, they are objects who may be &s;et in exchange for me, or are per&s;ons whom the treatment I receive might affect.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is no le&s;s, Sir, in a confidence in the genero&s;ity of your mind, than on account of your &s;uperior &s;tation that I have cho&s;en to importune you with this letter.</HI></P>

<P>IN an&s;wer to your Excellency's me&s;&s;age, re&s;pecting your Adjutant General, Major Andr&egrave;, and de&s;iring my idea of the rea&s;ons why he is detained, being under my pa&s;&s;ports, I have the honour to inform you, Sir, that I appre|hend a few hours mu&s;t return Major Andr&egrave; to your Excel|lency's orders, as that officer is a&s;&s;uredly under the pro|tection of a flag of truce &s;ent by me to him for the pur|po&s;e of a conver&s;ation which I reque&s;ted to hold <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> him relating to my&s;elf, and which I wi&s;hed to communi|cate through that officer to your Excellency.</P>
<P>I commanded at the time at We&s;t Point, had an undoubted right to &s;end my flag of truce for Major Andr&egrave;, who came to me under that protection, and having hold my conver&s;ation with him, I delivered him confidential papers in my own hand writing, to deliver to your Excel|lency, thinking it much properer he &s;hould return by land, I directed him to make u&s;e of the feigned name of John Ander&s;on, under which he had by my direction to come on &s;hore, and gave him my pa&s;&s;ports to go to the White Plains on his way to New-York. This officer cannot therefore fail of being immediately &s;ent to New-York, as he was invited to a conver&s;ation with me, for which I &s;ent him a flag of truce, and finally gave him pa&s;&s;ports for his &s;afe return to your Excellency; all which I had then a right to do, being in the actual &s;ervice of America, under the orders of Gene|ral

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Excellency is doubtle&s;s already appri&s;ed of the manner in which I was taken, and po&s;&s;ibly of the &s;erious light in which my conduct is con&s;idered, and the rigorous determination that is impending.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, I have obtained General Wa&s;hington's permi&s;&s;ion to &s;end you this letter; the object of which is, to remove from your brea&s;t any &s;u&s;|picion, that I could imagine I was bound by your Ex|cellency's orders to expo&s;e my&s;elf to what has happened. The events of coming within an enemy's po&s;ts, and of changing my dre&s;s, which led me to my pre&s;ent &s;ituati|on, were contrary to my own intentions, as they were to your orders; and the circuitous route, which I took to return, was impo&s;ed (perhaps unavoidably) without alternative upon me.</P>
<P>I am perfectly tranquil in mind, and prepared for any fate, to which an hone&s;t zeal for my King's &s;ervice may have devoted me.</P>
<P>In addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to your Excellency on this occa|&s;ion, the force of all my obligations to you, and of the attachment and gratitude I bear you, recurs to me. With all the warmth of my heart, I give you thanks for your Excellency's profu&s;e kindne&s;s to me; and I &s;end you the mo&s;t earne&s;t wi&s;hes for your welfare, which a faith|ful, affectionate, and re&s;pectful attendant can frame.</P>
<P>I have a mother and three &s;i&s;ters, to whom the value of my commi&s;&s;ion would be an object, as the lo&s;s of Grenada has much affected their income. It is needle&s;s to be more explicit on this &s;ubject; I am per&s;uaded of your Excellency's goodne&s;s.</P>

<P>IN an&s;wer to your Excellency's letter of the 26th in&s;tant, which I had the honour to receive, I am to in|form you, that Major Andr&eacute; was taken under &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances as would have ju&s;tified the mo&s;t &s;ummary proceedings again&s;t him. I determined, however, to re|fer his ca&s;e to the examination and deci&s;ion of a Board of General Officers, who have reported, on his free and voluntary confe&s;&s;ion and letters,&mdash;"That he came on &s;hore from the Vulture &s;loop of war in the night of the twenty-fir&s;t of September in&s;tant," &amp;c. &amp;c. as in the report of the Board of General Officers.</P>
<P>From the&s;e proceedings it is evident Major Andr&eacute; was employed in the execution of mea&s;ures very foreign to the objects of flags of truce, and &s;uch as they were ne|ver meant to authori&s;e or countenance in the mo&s;t di&s;tant degree; and this gentleman confe&s;&s;ed, with the greate&s;t candor, in the cour&s;e of his examination, "That it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to &s;uppo&s;e he came on &s;hore, under the &s;anction of a flag."</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A NOTE I have from General Greene, leaves me in doubt if his memory had &s;erved him, to relate to you with exactne&s;s the &s;ub&s;tance of the conver&s;ation that had pa&s;&s;ed between him and my&s;elf, on the &s;ubject of Major Andr&egrave;. In an affair of &s;o much con&s;equence to my friend, to the two armies, and humanity, I would leave no po&s;&s;ibility of a mi&s;under&s;tanding, and therefore take the liberty to put in writing the &s;ub&s;tance of what I &s;aid to General Greene.</P>
<P>I offered to prove, by the evidence of Colonel Robin|&s;on and the officers of the Vulture, that Major Andr&eacute; went on &s;hore at General Arnold's de&s;ire, in a boat &s;ent for him with a flag of truce; that he not only came a&s;hore with the knowledge and under the protection of the General who commanded in the di&s;trict, but that he took no &s;tep while on &s;hore but by direction of General Arnold, as will appear by the inclo&s;ed letter from him to your Excellency.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e circum&s;tances I could not, and hoped you would not, con&s;ider Major Andr&eacute; as a &s;py, for any im|proper phra&s;e in his letter to you.</P>
<P>The facts he relates corre&s;pond with the evidence I offer; but he admits a conclu&s;ion that does not follow. The change of cloaths and name was ordered by General Arnold, under who&s;e direction he nece&s;&s;arily was, while within his command. As General Greene and I did not agree in opinion, I wi&s;hed, that di&s;intere&s;ted gentlemen of knowledge of the law of war and nations, might be a&s;ked their opinion on the &s;ubject; and mentioned Mon|&s;ieur Knyphau&s;en, and General Rochambault.</P>
<P>I related that a Captain Robin&s;on had been delivered to Sir Henry Clinton as a &s;py, and undoubtedly was &s;uch; but that it being &s;ignified to him that you were de&s;irous
<PB N="19" REF="017043_0019_0FA25CF01B36CFE8">
that this man &s;hould be exchanged, he had ordered him to be exchanged.</P>
<P>I wi&s;hed that an intercour&s;e of &s;uch civilities, as the rules of war admit of, might take off many of its horrors. I admitted that Major Andr&eacute; had a great &s;hare of Sir Henry Clinton's e&s;teem, and that he would be infinitely obliged by his liberation; and that if he was permitted to return with me, I would engage to have any per&s;on you would be plea&s;ed to name &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P>I added, that Sir Henry Clinton had never put to death any per&s;on for a breach of the rules of war, though he had, and now has, many in his power. Under the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, much good may ari&s;e from hu|manity, much ill from the want of it. If that could give any weight, I beg leave to add, that your favourable treatment of Major Andr&eacute;, will be a favour I &s;hould ever be intent to return to any you hold dear.</P>
<P>My memory does not retain with the exactne&s;s I could wi&s;h, the words of the letter which General Greene &s;hewed me from Major Andr&egrave; to your Excellency. For Sir Henry Clinton's &s;atisfaction, I beg you will order a copy of it to be &s;ent to me at New-York.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE polite attention &s;hewn by your Excellency and the Gentlemen of your family to Mrs. Arnold, when in di&s;tre&s;s, demand my grateful acknowledgment and thanks, which I beg leave to pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>From your Excellency's letter to Sir Henry Clinton, I find a Board of General Officers have given it as their opinion, that Major Andr&eacute; comes under the de&s;cription of a &s;py: My good opinion of the candor and ju&s;tice of tho&s;e Gentlemen leads me to believe, that if they had been made fully acquainted with every circum&s;tance re|&s;pecting Major Andr&eacute;, that they would by no means have con&s;idered him in the light of a &s;py, or even of a pri|&s;oner. In ju&s;tice to him, I think it my duty to declare, that he came from on board the Vulture at my particular reque&s;t, by a flag &s;ent on purpo&s;e for him by Jo&s;hua Smith, E&s;q. who had permi&s;&s;ion to go to Dobbs's ferry to carry letters, and for other purpo&s;es not mentioned,
<PB N="20" REF="017043_0020_0FA25CF024C78ED0">
and to return. This was done as a blind to the &s;py boats: Mr. Smith at the &s;ame time had my private directions to go on board the Vulture, and bring on &s;hore Col. Robin|&s;on, or Mr. John Ander&s;on, which was the name I had reque&s;ted Major Andr&eacute; to a&s;&s;ume: At the &s;ame time I de&s;ired Mr. Smith to inform him, that he &s;hould have my protection, and a &s;afe pa&s;&s;port to return in the &s;ame boat, as &s;oon as our bu&s;ine&s;s was compleated. As &s;everal acci|dents intervened to prevent his being &s;ent on board, I gave him my pa&s;&s;port to return by land. Major Andr&egrave; came on &s;hore in his uniform (without di&s;gui&s;e) which with much reluctance, at my particular and pre&s;&s;ing in&s;tance, he ex|changed for another coat. I furni&s;hed him with a hor&s;e and &s;addle, and pointed out the route by which he was to return. And as commanding officer in the department, I had an undoubted right to tran&s;act all the&s;e matters; which, if wrong, Major Andr&eacute; ought by no means to &s;uffer for them.</P>
<P>But if, after this ju&s;t and candid repre&s;entation of Major Andr&eacute;'s ca&s;e, the Board of General Officers adhere to their former opinion, I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e it dictated by pa&s;&s;ion and re&s;entment; and if that Gentleman &s;hould &s;uffer the &s;everity of their &s;entence, I &s;hall think my&s;elf bound by every tie of duty and honour, to retaliate on &s;uch unhappy per&s;ons of your army, as may fall within my power, that the re&s;pect due to flags, and to the law of nations, may be better under&s;tood and ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>I have further to ob&s;erve, that forty of the principal inhabitants of South-Carolina have ju&s;tly forfeited their lives, which have hitherto been &s;pared by the clemency of His Excellency Sir Henry Clinton, who cannot in ju&s;tice extend his mercy to them any longer, if Major Andr&eacute; &s;uffers; which in all probability will open a &s;cene of blood at which humanity will revolt.</P>
<P>Suffer me to intreat your Excellency, for your own and the honour of humanity, and the love you have of ju&s;tice, that you &s;uffer not an unju&s;t &s;entence to touch the life of Major Andr&eacute;.</P>
<P>But if this warning &s;hould be di&s;regarded, and he &s;uf|fer, I call heaven and earth to witne&s;s, that your Ex|cellency will be ju&s;tly an&s;werable for the torrent of blood that may be &s;pilt in con&s;equence.</P>
