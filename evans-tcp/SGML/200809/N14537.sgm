</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WITHOUT &s;peaking to the Con|text, which we may, at our lei|&s;ure, read with plea&s;ure and pro|fit; by the ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, I &s;hall im|mediately come to my Text, in which <HI>Paul</HI> tells the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians</HI> that, when he, and <HI>Si|las</HI> and <HI>Timothy</HI> preached the Go&s;pel among them, they received it not as the word of men, but, as it was in truth, the Word of GOD, which wrought effectually in them, as it did in all true believers. In &s;peaking to the&s;e words I &s;hall &s;hew,</P>
<P>FIRST. What we are to under|&s;tand by the Word, or Go&s;pel, which is evidently intended by it.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="018428_0003_0FA76BE05BCBBCE8" MS="y">SECONDLY. That this Go&s;pel is the very Word of GOD.</P>
<P>THIRDLY. That Believers <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> re|ceive<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> as <HI>&s;uch.</HI></P>
<P>FOURTHLY. That it worketh effec|tually on all &s;uch Believers.</P>
<P>LASTLY. To improve the &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="1">I&s;t. I AM to &s;hew what we are to under|&s;tand by the Word or Go&s;pel. Our SA|VIOUR gives us a clear de&s;cription of it, <HI>John</HI> iii. 16; where he tells <HI>Nichodemus,</HI> that GOD <HI>&s;o loved the world&punc; that he gave his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever believ|eth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;t|ing life.</HI> It is implied here, that fallen man was in a peri&s;hing condition: That GOD gave his Son for us, that we might not peri&s;h, but be &s;aved eternally; and al&s;o that he purcha&s;ed &s;alvation for us by his death. The Scripture tells us, that CHRIST by his &s;uffering became the Author of eter|nal &s;alvation. It is a&s;&s;erted al&s;o, that this was owing to the great love of GOD. <HI>For GOD</HI> &s;o <HI>loved the world, &amp;c.</HI> With &s;o great a love, that men nor angels cannot conceive: Only GOD, in his infinite mind, can com|prehend
<PB N="5" REF="018428_0004_0FA76BE122AF6500">
the full meaning of the little word <HI>&s;o</HI> in this place: And la&s;tly, that Believers only are benefited by this &s;alvation; this ble&s;&s;edne&s;s only cometh by faith. If a man &s;hould do good works a thou&s;and years to obtain &s;alvation, he would mi&s;s of it; but whoever believes the Go&s;pel, and wants no|thing but the death of CHRIST to recom|mend him to the favour of GOD &s;hall cer|tainly be ju&s;tified and &s;aved. For GOD can be ju&s;t in ju&s;tifying and &s;aving &s;uch: They having, in their Surety, an&s;wered the demands of the law both penal and pre|ceptive.</P>
<P N="2">IIdly. I AM to &s;hew, that the Go&s;pel is the very Word of GOD, <HI>as in truth it is the Word of GOD</HI>: The Scripture again and again calls it the Word of GOD, and it is called the Word of CHRIST who is GOD; and the Mini&s;ters &s;ent by him to preach have all along declared, that it was the Word of GOD which they preached; and &s;uch Mini&s;ters know it is the Word of GOD by the effects of it. A miracle has been wrought in their &s;ouls by the name of JESUS; believing in him they were made new creatures, haters of &s;in and lovers of GOD; they have al&s;o that joy and peace in believing, which they know GOD alone is
<PB N="6" REF="018428_0005_0FA76BE1F126C380">
the Author of; knowing therefore that the Go&s;pel is of GOD, they preach it with boldne&s;s, and authority, and not as the Scribes.</P>
<P N="3">IIIdly. I AM to &s;hew, that when any one truly believes, he always receives the Go&s;pel as the Word of GOD; as we may know by the effects of faith, that the Go&s;pel is the Word of GOD, of which I have been &s;peaking, &s;o we may know that the Go&s;pel is divine, previous to our tru&s;t|ing in CHRIST for &s;alvation. Sometimes when men have no uncommon &s;en&s;e of the worth of their &s;ouls, but are thinking of CHRIST and &s;alvation, the Go&s;pel comes to them in power, in much a&s;&s;urance, and in the HOLY GHOST; by the Spirit of GOD they are in&s;ured, not that <HI>they</HI> &s;hall be &s;aved by CHRIST, but that there is &s;al|vation in CHRIST for the chief of &s;inners under Heaven; nor can they deliberate|ly doubt of this any more then they can doubt whether they have &s;ouls in their bo|dies; &s;uch is the demon&s;tration of the &s;pirit.</P>
<P N="4">IVthly. THIS faith is &s;aid to work effectually,; that which is immediately wrought on the &s;oul is tru&s;ting in JESUS
<PB N="7" REF="018428_0006_0FA76BE2B62DA8D0">
CHRIST, at the &s;ame time believing that there is &s;alvation in JESUS CHRIST for the chief of &s;inners; and that GOD him&s;elf is the Author of the good news! a tru&s;t in JESUS CHRIST for &s;alvation, and thereby &s;et to their &s;eals that GOD is true: And as there is no believing that the Go&s;pel is the Word of GOD without tru&s;ting in CHRIST, the &s;cripture-name for Believers is that of Tru&s;ter.</P>
<P>IN him &s;hall the <HI>Gentiles</HI> tru&s;t: And this is their Old Te&s;tament and their New Te&s;|tament name. <HI>Paul</HI> delights in calling them Tru&s;ters: Which word was de&s;igned by GOD to teach us this le&s;&s;on, <HI>viz.</HI> That when the Go&s;pel comes to the &s;oul and con|&s;cience with a <HI>Thus &s;aith the LORD,</HI> we always tru&s;t in CHRIST immediately and are ju&s;tified, and heirs of eternal life. This is the Go&s;pel of GOD. What then &s;hall we think of their go&s;pel who teach, that men are ju&s;tified by faith and works toge|ther? This is another go&s;pel very little akin to the Go&s;pel of GOD, which teach|es, that men are ju&s;tified by faith only; and that &s;aith and ju&s;tification are &s;o near together, that there can be no room for any good works to be between them. In|deed tho&s;e that attain to what they call
<PB N="8" REF="018428_0007_0FA76BE355BD1428">
the believing part of ju&s;tification, if they really do believe they are ju&s;tified by GOD before they attempt to do any thing of the doing part of it. According to their divinity, let us &s;uppo&s;e a man to have attained the believing part of ju&s;tification, and al&s;o for &s;ometime to have been engaged in doing the doing part; this man runs well; he is more than half ju&s;tified already. Let us al&s;o &s;uppo&s;e him not to be weary in well-doing, but that he is up and doing, and is re&s;olved to keep doing the doing part, 'till he is quite ju&s;tified: The que&s;tion is, How long this poor man mu&s;t keep doing hard ju&s;tifying work; (for only they who are ju&s;tified can do them with plea&s;ure;) I &s;ay how long mu&s;t he keep doing hard ju&s;|tifying works 'till he is compleatly ju&s;tified? The mo&s;t learned man upon earth will not think him&s;elf ca&s;ui&s;t enough to an&s;wer this que&s;tion. It is impo&s;&s;ible that tho&s;e who hold ju&s;tification by works, <HI>and know how to think,</HI> &s;hould think much of their own doc|trine, without thinking &s;ometimes what is called <HI>reductio ad ab&s;urdum</HI>; or their being reduced to downright ab&s;urdity. The Au|thor has for many years thought it his duty to magnify CHRIST with his tongue and pen, by di&s;puting again&s;t ju&s;tification by works; and now in his old age he has attack|ed
<PB N="9" REF="018428_0008_0FA76BE41B67AFA0">
it with a <HI>New Argument</HI> with brevity, and he hopes not ineffectually. For the men of this device mu&s;t make it appear, that faith and ju&s;tification are not &s;o near toge|ther as the Scripture places them, otherwi&s;e their beloved divinity <HI>mu&s;t die the death.</HI> No|thing can &s;ave the life of it but doing that which is <HI>impo&s;&s;ible.</HI> It will be as hard to make a world, as to prove by Scripture, that there is any doing good ju&s;tifying works between faith and ju&s;tification. The Apo&s;|tle <HI>Paul,</HI> &s;peaking of CHRIST, &s;ays, <HI>By him all that believe are ju&s;tified, Acts</HI> xiii. 39: By which he could not mean, that they would be ju&s;tified &s;oon after by their good ju&s;tifying works tacked to faith; <HI>Paul</HI> abominated &s;uch &s;tuff. He writes in the pre&s;ent ten&s;e or time, meaning, that all are ju&s;tified when they are believers; or that as &s;oon as they believe, they are that very moment ju&s;tified per&s;ons. Common &s;en&s;e and con&s;cience will own the words can bear no other meaning; the mouth of the LORD &s;pake the&s;e words to us by <HI>Paul.</HI> Therefore, ju&s;tification by works which is the great <HI>Diana of Chri&s;tendom,</HI> is. killed by the words <HI>Paul</HI> &s;pake in the name of the LORD, <HI>if the Scripture can kill it.&mdash;Love</HI> is al&s;o wrought in the &s;oul at the &s;ame time. We do not love fir&s;t and then believe: It is not con&s;i&s;tent with Scripture nor with the Pro|te&s;tant doctrine. The Author recollects
<PB N="10" REF="018428_0009_0FA76BE5C630B398">
with plea&s;ure, that in his younger years he drew his pen again&s;t it more than once. We believe and then love GOD, and then we love CHRIST who is GOD; we love him for all his perfections. Some love him becau&s;e they hope he died for them, and they &s;hall be &s;aved by him: The&s;e are haters of CHRIST; and we love him al&s;o with a &s;uperlative love. If we do not love him above all other be|loveds, we are not true lovers; and with a practical love.</P>
<P>THIS is the love of GOD that we keep his commandments; we keep them by his grace not to be ju&s;tified by them, for we &s;ee we are ju&s;tified by CHRIST. We are con&s;trained to keep them by his love, and we keep all his commandments. <HI>Then &s;hall I not be a&s;hamed when I have re&s;pect to all his commandments.</HI> They are very careful to ob&s;erve the New Commandment of Brotherly Love: For we are taught of GOD to love one another; and they love all the Saints. Some high Pro|fe&s;&s;ors care but little for tho&s;e that fear GOD and keep his commandments: They can be bitter as if under the influence of the &s;tar cal|led wormwood; though at the &s;ame time they can care&s;s all tho&s;e who are of their party; of their &s;ide, and follow with them. One may have enough and enough of &s;uch Brotherly Love without any Chri&s;tianity at
<PB N="11" REF="018428_0010_0FA76BE6506E5068">
all. It is religion to get rid of &s;uch religion as this: And this is an a&s;&s;ociating love; the &s;heep of CHRIST, like literal &s;heep, love to be together. All &s;hyne&s;s is contrary to that great commandment, <HI>Love the Brother|hood.</HI> He that is &s;hy of his brother, hath done him &s;ome harm, &s;poke evil of him, or hath an evil frame of heart towards him; if we have done them no harm, nor allow our|&s;elves to &s;peak evil of them; but have that love for them which the Apo&s;tle calls the fruit of the Spirit, we &s;hall find it <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> for us to be &s;hy of the members of CHRIST; and &s;hall pity the &s;hy ones who are &s;ick of a bad di&s;temper. This love is al&s;o a love of &s;ervice; we &s;hall &s;erve the Brethren &s;piritu|ally and temporally to the utmo&s;t of our pow|er with plea&s;ure and delight: We &s;hall &s;erve CHRIST and keep his commandments couragiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>PAUL and his Fellow-laborers were not di&s;|heartned from &s;erving CHRIST by preaching the Go&s;pel, by the trial of cruel mockings and other per&s;ecutions which were made their lot; and &s;o it has been and will be with all other Mini&s;ters and private Chri&s;tians, men, wo|men and children, when called to &s;uffer per|&s;ecution for CHRIST; they are divinely hard|ned and will endure hardne&s;s as good &s;oldiers, rejoicing that they are accounted worthy to
<PB N="12" REF="018428_0011_0FA76BE704E34050">
&s;uffer for his name &s;ake. A certain Bi&s;hop has informed the world, that Chri&s;tians now-a-days are not per&s;ecuted for their religion: That the world is now &s;o reconciled to it, they love them the better for it; and that this is the rea&s;on that men have &s;o little of the comforts of the HOLY GHOST to what the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians had, becau&s;e they will never be per&s;ecuted. A blind Guide! And the faith of the&s;e Chri&s;tians will work effectually; they will not draw back unto perdition, becau&s;e their faith is the operation of GOD. CHRIST dwelleth in their hearts by faith, and they &s;hall receive the end of their faith, the &s;alva|tion of their &s;ouls. When they die they enter into life, and at the &s;econd coming of CHRIST they &s;hall be rai&s;ed to glory, honor and im|mortality: As we all know by the abun|dant te&s;timony of the Holy Scriptures, there|fore I &s;hall recite no pa&s;&s;ages in proof of it.&mdash; But it is time to improve the &s;ubject; and</P>
<P N="1">(1&s;t.) WE learn from what has been &s;aid, that the Go&s;pel is properly &s;tiled glad tidings of good things, the &s;ound of the Go&s;pel is the joyfulle&s;t &s;ound that ever was heard by the children of men; it proclaims that when a &s;inful world was peri&s;hing GOD &s;aved us by the death of his dear Son, and all that be|lieve in him &s;hall obtain eternal &s;alvation: And not only the good news, but the Author
<PB N="13" REF="018428_0012_0FA76BE7D690D330">
of it, makes the Go&s;pel worthy of all ac|ceptation: For man is not the author of it but GOD him&s;elf: It is the faithful &s;aying of GOD, with whom it is impo&s;&s;ible to lie. We are told by him, that if the wor&s;t men and women out of Hell want nothing but the death of CHRIST to recommend them to the divine favor, they &s;hall as certainly be &s;aved as there is a GOD in Heaven. May this glorious Go&s;pel of the ble&s;&s;ed GOD be preached to every creature under Heaven! May the Preachers of this great &s;alvation in|&s;i&s;t much on the amazing love of GOD to enemies, which cau&s;ed it! Shewing, that we were in &s;o low an e&s;tate, that were it not for the death of CHRIST we mu&s;t have peri&s;hed forever. Some will think the la&s;t expre&s;&s;ion is a &s;trong one. It is a &s;trong one, and was intended for a <HI>&s;trong</HI> one: Though the whole tribe of <HI>Socinians, Arians, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> will be again&s;t it: And &s;ome, who are thought or|thodox, will &s;ometimes be &s;o modi&s;h as to &s;peak lightly of it. Let us <HI>weigh it in the balance.</HI> The Scripture knows but of two ways of ju&s;tification, by the works of the law and by CHRIST's dying for us. If there had been a law which could have given life, then righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hould have come by the law: But <HI>by the deeds of the law could no fle&s;h living be ju&s;tified</HI>; therefore, GOD who is rich in mercy, for the great love wherewith he lov|ed
<PB N="14" REF="018428_0013_0FA76BE896A43808" MS="y">
us, &s;ent his Son JESUS CHRIST, who was GOD as well as man, and who&s;e blood is in Scripture called the blood of GOD, with his con&s;ent to die a &s;acrifice and cur&s;e for our &s;ins: He hath redeemed us from the cur&s;e of the law, being made a cur&s;e for us; and by him all that believe are ju&s;tified. But the que&s;tion may be a&s;ked, Whether CHRIST's death was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that if he had not died we <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have peri&s;hed? I an&s;wer yes. He him&s;elf tells us &s;o in what he &s;ays to <HI>Nicho|demus,</HI> in the third chapter of <HI>John</HI>; where he &s;ays, <HI>As</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>lifted up the &s;erpent in the wilderne&s;s, &s;o mu&s;t the Son of Man be lifted up, that who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hould not pe|ri&s;h</HI>:&mdash;And afterwards, that <HI>GOD &s;o loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son that they &s;hould not peri&s;h</HI>;&mdash;which is as much as if CHRIST had &s;aid, man <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have peri&s;hed, <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have peri&s;hed, if I had not died for his ju&s;tification. Our opponents will not &s;ay we are not ju&s;tified by the death of CHRIST, but cannot &s;ee his death was ne|ce&s;&s;ary, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary that if he had not died man mu&s;t have peri&s;hed. This is a hard &s;ay|ing; too &s;trong meat; they cannot bear there &s;hould be a <HI>mu&s;t</HI> in the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>THE truth is, the&s;e men believe that though none could be ju&s;tified by their works, and though CHRIST had never died for our
<PB N="15" REF="018428_0014_0FA76BE94E485B58">
ju&s;tification, that GOD could and would have ju&s;tified and made us happy &s;ome other way. What other way? He had power to love, ju&s;tify and make us happy without &s;hewing any re&s;entment again&s;t &s;in. Be a&s;toni&s;hed Oh ye Heavens at this! Had any Preachers in <HI>Paul</HI>'s time employed all their wit and pow|ers of their mind, to prove it was not <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> CHRIST &s;hould die for our &s;ins, they would hardly have e&s;caped his anathema maranatha. GOD did ju&s;tify us by the death of his Son; nor could he ju&s;tify us in a <HI>Chri&s;tle&s;s Way.</HI> Omnipotence it&s;elf could not give a be|ing to it; there is no beauty of holine&s;s in <HI>that Way:</HI> Therefore, an infinitely holy GOD could not be the Author of it. If we only &s;uppo&s;e it as exi&s;ting, this will prove it ne|ver could exi&s;t. Let us &s;uppo&s;e GOD had ju&s;tified man in &s;uch a Chri&s;tle&s;s Way; could he have glorified his holine&s;s thereby? Eve|ry man mu&s;t &s;ay no; but <HI>quite the rever&s;e.</HI> Then the Angels could not have cried one to another holy, holy, holy is the LORD. Then the innumerable company of Angels and Spi|rits of ju&s;t men made perfect, could not have magnified him in their &s;ongs, as a GOD of purer eyes than to behold iniquity. We read, <HI>There was &s;ilence in Heaven for the &s;pace of half an hour</HI>; but there mu&s;t have been an ever|la&s;ting &s;ilence in Heaven, as to &s;uch prai&s;es and hallelujahs, had not GOD redeemed us by the death of his dear Son.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="018428_0015_0FA76BEA001FFF68">To &s;uppo&s;e that man could have been ju&s;|tified without any atonement for &s;in is a mon&s;ter in divinity, created in the imagi|nation of man's heart by the evil one, to di&s;parage CHRIST; and yet how hath this mon&s;ter been hugged and care&s;&s;ed by Chri&s;|tians! It hath been matter of much wonder, grief and ju&s;t indignation, that learned men, Divines as well as others, &s;hould employ their mental powers to prove there was no nece&s;&s;ity of CHRIST's &s;hedding his blood for the remi&s;&s;ion of our &s;ins: By which per|ver&s;e di&s;puting, in&s;tead of magnifying CHRIST with <HI>Paul,</HI> they dimini&s;h him, rob him of his glory and make &s;port for the wor&s;t ene|mies he hath in the whole world.</P>
<P>LORD JESUS what wilt thou do for thy great Name!

thou&s;ands of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> who know that they are ju&s;tified by GOD, and that the blood of JESUS CHRIST his Son clean&s;eth them from all &s;in.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) WE learn the dignity of the Mini|&s;ters who are employed to preach the Go&s;pel, which is the Word of GOD him&s;elf. GOD &s;peaks by them: They are GOD's mouth to the people. We read of an Angel's flying through the mid&s;t of Heaven, having the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel. The highe&s;t Angel in Heaven would think it a great honor to be employed in preaching the Go&s;pel of GOD; but GOD would not &s;peak to us by Angels, who&s;e terror would make us afraid, but by men &s;ubject to like pa&s;&s;ions with our&s;elves. And what an honor is it to them that JESUS CHRIST was the fir&s;t Preacher of the Go&s;|pel, who was &s;ent by his Father to preach! As he &s;ent them, they are employed the &s;ame way in which CHRIST was employed while he was in the world, which was made by him. Every one of his Mini&s;ters thinks this a grea|ter honor to him than if CHRIST had made him Emperor over the whole world. And be|&s;ides, they are dignified with the office and title of Amba&s;&s;adors, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> v. 20; <HI>For we are Amba&s;&s;adors for</HI> CHRIST. Kings and Po|tentates &s;end Amba&s;&s;adors to Rebels and Trai|tors, to let them know there is an act of in|demnity in their &s;avor, that they may re|turn

JESUS CHRIST was the fir&s;t Amba&s;&s;ador: GOD who &s;ent him to make atonement for our &s;ins by his death, &s;ent him al&s;o to be his Amba&s;&s;ador, to pro|claim free remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins by the &s;acrifice of him&s;elf, and who&s;oever &s;hould believe in him &s;hould be reconciled unto GOD and eternal|ly ble&s;&s;ed. After he a&s;cended to Heaven, he made his Apo&s;tles and all his Mini&s;ters Am|ba&s;&s;adors to proclaim the good news of pardon, peace and reconciliation by the blood of the cro&s;s; and <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays, he and the other Am|ba&s;&s;adors have be&s;ought &s;inners as though GOD him&s;elf be&s;ought them, and prayed them as in CHRIST's &s;tead to be reconciled to GOD, who had made him to be &s;in for us who knew no &s;in, that we might be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of GOD in him. When men do believe that Amba&s;&s;adors do be&s;eech them in GOD's &s;tead, and pray them in CHRIST's &s;tead to be reconciled to GOD, they are in a moment reconciled and are real Saints. May JESUS CHRIST be with his Amba&s;&s;adors, and make them more faithful and &s;ucce&s;sful than ever; that thou&s;ands and thou&s;ands may be reconciled to GOD, love GOD and be eter|nally in his favor!</P>

Once people believed this to be true: People's concern about the world and the things of it was of a &s;econdary nature; their main care was that they might <HI>lay up in &s;tore a good foundation again&s;t the time to come, and lay hold on eternal life!</HI> But how great is the al|teration; never did men de&s;pi&s;e their own &s;ouls and neglect the great &s;alvation more than they do at this day!

Sometime ago a number of the&s;e wretches, having their tongues &s;et on fire of Hell, a &s;erious woman reproving them, they ju&s;tified them&s;elves by &s;aying there was no Hell, nor any Devil, but an Heaven, and that they knew they &s;hould all go to Heaven and be happy forever.

among us! It is the mind of many &s;erious and godly people, that Dei&s;m and Athei&s;m with all their cur&s;ed effects have been very much owing to certain <HI>&s;trange Doctrines</HI> which have been preached among us with too great acceptance. I &s;hall therefore &s;pend &s;ome time in &s;peaking of the&s;e doctrines, and warning again&s;t them.</P>
<P>THE principal is the Doctrine of <HI>Univer&s;al Salvation</HI>; or at the &s;econd coming of CHRIST all fle&s;h &s;hall be &s;aved eternally. I &s;hall men|tion only one of the many pa&s;&s;ages that I might mention, which &s;peaks of the end and de&s;ign of his coming at the la&s;t day, <HI>viz. Acts</HI> xvii. 31. Where it is &s;aid, that GOD <HI>hath ap|pointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s by that Man whom he hath ordain|ed; whereof he hath given a&s;&s;urance unto all men, in that he hath rai&s;ed him from the dead.</HI> There we are told, that GOD hath ordained CHRIST to be the Judge of the world, who is well qualified as being GOD and man; and that he will judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s, ren|dering to every man according to his deeds: Indignation and wrath, tribulation and angui&s;h to every &s;oul of man that doeth evil; but glo|ry, honor and peace to them that do well. And that GOD hath appointed the <HI>very day</HI> in which the world &s;hall be judged, which will be a ble&s;&s;ed day to the righteous; but a tre|mendous
<PB N="22" REF="018428_0021_0FA76BF2A2FF2EC8">
day to the wicked: And that we may be as certain of all this, as we are that GOD rai&s;ed his Son from the dead. The Univer&s;ali&s;ts do not profe&s;s them&s;elves to be Dei&s;ts, but Believers of the Scripture: And yet they do not believe that the judgment &s;hall be &s;et and the books opened, and that men &s;hall then be judged according to what they have done in the body, whether good or evil, any more than if they were Dei&s;ts and Infidels. That <HI>ble&s;&s;ed day</HI> in which GOD's people and the Devil's people are to be eternally happy, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be very near at hand. It hath been a&s;&s;erted, that their writers for thirty years together have de|clared, that we might be almo&s;t continually looking for CHRIST as coming in the clouds of Heaven, which mu&s;t be matter of &s;weet con&s;olation even to tho&s;e who have grown old and grey-headed in the &s;ervice of the De|vil; giving them hopes that they might enjoy the plea&s;ures of &s;in for a longer &s;ea&s;on, even until the coming of CHRIST, and then, though they knew them&s;elves to be the children of the Devil, they &s;hould certainly appear with him in glory. This is part of that hope which their Teachers &s;et before them. But what if our LORD delays his coming, and wicked men are doomed to Tophet? It has been &s;trongly a&s;&s;erted, that the puni&s;hment of Hell does not con&s;i&s;t &s;o much in torment as in
<PB N="23" REF="018428_0022_0FA76BF3047094D8">
&s;uffering much darkne&s;s and ignorance: How|ever this &s;uffering cannot la&s;t longer than the &s;econd coming of CHRIST, which mo&s;t Di|vines think cannot be far off: And then their afflictions and &s;ufferings which have been but for a moment, in &s;cripture-&s;tile, will not be worthy to be compared with the glory which &s;hall be revealed. What glory? They &s;hall be rai&s;ed with bodies fa&s;hioned like unto the glorious body of JESUS CHRIST, they &s;hall be pre&s;ented before the throne of glory with exceeding joy: They &s;hall &s;ee GOD as he &s;ees them, and know GOD as he knows them. They &s;hall know the heighth, length, depth and breadth of his love: And they and all the heavenly ho&s;t being filled with love to GOD and love to one another, &s;hall &s;ing prai&s;es and hallelujahs to him that &s;itteth upon the throne and unto the LAMB. Nor will there be any interruption or period to their bli&s;s; it will be commen&s;urate with the days of eternity.</P>
<P>THIS mu&s;t be reviving to the &s;ons of Beli|al, who ble&s;s them&s;elves in their heart, and &s;ay they &s;hall have peace, though they walk in the imagination of their heart, and in the &s;ight of their eyes: For though &s;uch harden|ed men have no firm belief of a future pu|ni&s;hment, this doctrine mu&s;t comfort them, that the puni&s;hment in Hell is infinitely &s;hor|ter

in duration, than the happine&s;s of the hea|venly world, which will follow and is eter|nal. They will not think it worth while to be much concerned about a puni&s;hment which will be more than a hundred thou&s;and mil|lion times le&s;s than a moment. The &s;ons of darkne&s;s no doubt do comfort them&s;elves, and will comfort them&s;elves and one another with &s;uch con&s;olations as the&s;e. And who can &s;ay they are not &s;trong con&s;olations, if the dear, dear doctrine of <HI>Univer&s;al Salvation</HI> is true, which they hear preached with &s;o much plea&s;ure and delight. Not that Preachers are to be faulted if people take plea&s;ure in hear|ing them preach: It is part of our office, we are helpers of their joy; we ought to com|fort others with the con&s;olations wherewith we our&s;elves are comforted of GOD. The Preachers of Univer&s;al Salvation are great com|forters; every individual is a <HI>Barnabas,</HI> a &s;on of con&s;olation: They preach no terror: They never addre&s;s their hearers as <HI>Paul</HI> addre&s;|&s;ed the <HI>Corinthians; We mu&s;t all appear before the judgment-&s;eat of CHRIST, that every one may receive the things done in the boay, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad: Knowing therefore the terror of the LORD we per&s;uade men.</HI> If any one of their Teachers &s;hould preach in <HI>&s;uch a &s;train,</HI> how greatly would it be re&s;ented! He would indeed be guilty of joining with <HI>Paul</HI> in overturning
<PB N="25" REF="018428_0024_0FA76BF4A9DD9338">
the doctrine of <HI>Univer&s;al Salvation</HI>; and would undoubtedly be excommunicated for that zeal and love to the &s;ouls of men, which were con&s;picuous in the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI>: They are never in their element, but when they are preaching comfort; in this they have an advantage above other Mini&s;ters, though not <HI>an honorable one.</HI> Other Mini&s;ters are li|mited: They can only &s;ay, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed and hap|py are all tho&s;e people who&s;e GOD is the LORD</HI>: But the&s;e men can &s;ay, Ble&s;&s;ed and happy are all tho&s;e people who&s;e GOD is the LORD; and at the &s;ame time ble&s;&s;ed are all tho&s;e people who&s;e God is the Devil. For they all hold, the <HI>whole human race</HI> are intitled to that Salvation which is by CHRIST, which cannot be lo&s;t&punc; If it is &s;uppo&s;ed it may be lo&s;t, they are like the fooli&s;h woman who pulled down the hou&s;e which &s;he built with her own hands. The wor&s;t of men have that title to &s;alvation, which is of more worth than the whole world; they have that good part that can never be taken from them. If a man has a va&s;t e&s;tate which is firm by law, how is he loved, e&s;teemed and regarded as a rich man? That man therefore that has &s;uch a good part in CHRIST which can never be taken away, mu&s;t be looked upon even in this world as <HI>rich towards GOD</HI> and happy. Their durable riches are in rever&s;ion; they are to be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them at the &s;econd com|ing

<P>IT may be &s;aid, you have a&s;&s;erted the eternity of their happine&s;s before, but have not proved it; It is ab&s;olutely certain that it is without any period? Indeed it is, You that are acquainted with your bibles know that be&s;ides its being called everla&s;ting life, it is &s;tiled an incorruptible; that is, an eternal inheritance, everla&s;ting con&s;olations, eternal redemption, &amp;c. Its being called (<HI>Heb.</HI> ii. 3.) &s;o great &s;alvation implies as much; for if it had not been an eternal &s;alvation, it would have been infinitely le&s;s: It would have been a <HI>little Salvation.</HI> To which we may add, the te&s;timony of all Chri&s;tians, who declare with joy, that tho&s;e who are re|deemed by CHRIST &s;hall be with GOD, and eternally happy in his love. After they have been with GOD in glory as many thou&s;ands of ages as there are &s;pires of gra&s;s on the ground, they will be no nearer the period to their bli&s;s than when they were at fir&s;t admitted to it. And after they have enjoyed it as many thou&s;ands of ages more as there are drops of water in the ocean, they have approached no nearer to a period. The &s;ame may be &s;aid with regard to their

enjoying this felicity as many thou&s;ands of ages as there are &s;ands on the &s;ea &s;hore. Oh eternity! eternity! eternity! One cannot think of their happine&s;s without calling them ble&s;&s;ed. Ble&s;&s;ed, eternally ble&s;&s;ed are the people in &s;uch a ca&s;e! And yet the&s;e eternal|ly ble&s;&s;ed ones while they lived on earth, (who can believe it?) had no other GOD but the Devil. This is the Creed of the <HI>Uni|ver&s;ali&s;ts.</HI> But it is contrary to the Word which a&s;&s;ures us that GOD is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity: That the unrigh|teous &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of GOD; and that no unholy per&s;ons &s;hall ever dwell with him. Such bla&s;phemous contempt of the truth and holine&s;s of GOD ought to be &s;hocking to all Chri&s;tians. There are ma|ny Chri&s;tians who would not oppo&s;e the truth and holine&s;s of GOD, &s;o much as is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to hold <HI>Univer&s;al Salvation</HI> for the <HI>whole World</HI>: The Author is one of them&punc; Their Religion is al&s;o contrary to the very light of nature, which teaches, that none are happy after death but tho&s;e who have lived virtuous and moral lives. The&s;e <HI>blind men</HI> are <HI>blinder</HI> than the <HI>blind Heathens</HI>! The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> could never preach any other doctrine but this, that they and they only who have their fruit unto holi|ne&s;s &s;hall have their end eternal life. If any of the&s;e <HI>Univer&s;ali&s;ts</HI> had lived in <HI>Paul</HI>'s day, and declared that thou&s;ands and millions

will live with GOD in Heaven, who lived without GOD in the world, and &s;erved the Devil to their late&s;t breath, <HI>Paul</HI> would have cur&s;ed their Religion <HI>heartily</HI> in the <HI>name of the LORD.</HI> I believe my Rea|ders will join in &s;aying that <HI>Paul</HI> would have cur&s;ed that Religion <HI>with a cur&s;e.</HI> Po&s;|&s;ibly &s;ome of the <HI>Univer&s;ali&s;ts</HI> may be of the &s;ame mind, and yet not think it worth while to alter their Religion for &s;o &s;mall a matter as <HI>Paul</HI>'s being again&s;t them. It appears by what has been &s;aid now as be|fore, that the&s;e men mu&s;t &s;hine and be im|minent for comforting tho&s;e <HI>who are ca&s;t down.</HI> The truth is, they are qualified by <HI>their own divinity,</HI> not by GOD's <HI>divinity,</HI> to out-comfort all the Mini&s;ters upon the face of the earth. The Scripture teaches us to di&s;tingui&s;h between Comforters and Com|forters. GOD, &s;aith, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> xl. 1. <HI>Comfort ye, comfort ye my people.</HI> He would have them comforted by knowing that their iniquities are pardoned, and that they &s;hall be happy forever.</P>
<P>WE read of &s;ome who comfort others by prophe&s;ying <HI>&s;mooth things,</HI> (<HI>I&s;a.</HI> xxx. 10,) but not right things. Such are the Com|forters I am &s;peaking of. Oh what &s;mooth, pallatable and fle&s;h and blood doctrine do they preach, that their people may be al|ways rejoicing! Do they never bid them re|joice with fear and trembling? I &s;ay no:

This would be to murder their own di|vinity. How do they quiet them with re|gard to that text, <HI>Heb.</HI> iv. 1. <HI>Let us there|fore fear, le&s;t a promi&s;e being left us of enter|ing into his re&s;t, any of you &s;hould &s;eem to come &s;hort of it?</HI> By telling them they need not fear mi&s;&s;ing the heavenly re&s;t.

All the people of GOD therefore, and all the Devil's people &s;hall as certainly enjoy that re&s;t forever, as if they were in pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. Our Savior &s;peaks of it in <HI>Matt.</HI> xvi. as a dread|ful thing for a man to <HI>lo&s;e his own &s;oul.</HI> How will they pacify them as to this? By telling them that learned and critical Di|vines may put &s;uch a meaning to CHRIST's words as may be con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>Univer|&s;al Salvation.</HI> What mi&s;erable &s;treights and &s;hifts are the&s;e men put to to keep their be|loved doctrine alive?

ble&s;&s;ed and happy forever. So that the day of the wrath of GOD and the revelation of his righteous judgment, will be a time of refre&s;hing to all the children of wrath; and none are more &s;ure that they are living in this world and &s;erving the Devil, than they are &s;ure that when CHRIST comes they &s;hall appear with him in glory.

<P>I HAVE fini&s;hed what I had to &s;ay of the doctrine that all fle&s;h &s;hall be happy forever at the &s;econd coming of CHRIST, which has cau&s;ed much grief and &s;orrow of heart to many &s;erious and godly per&s;ons, and no wonder, for they love CHRIST and want that all men &s;hould honor him from the ri&s;ing of the &s;un to the going down of the &s;ame. They cannot bear that any &s;hould

di&s;honor him by preaching a go&s;pel in his name contrary to truth and his divine per|fections; they love the &s;ouls of men. They have &s;ome of that &s;pirit of CHRIST, that infinite Lover of &s;ouls, which cau&s;es them to long for their &s;alvation. Their hearts de&s;ire and prayer to GOD is, that Mini&s;ters by preaching may &s;ave their own &s;ouls and the &s;ouls of them that hear them.</P>
<P>THERE is another doctrine that has grieved their hearts, called <HI>Origin</HI>'s <HI>Doctrine,</HI> akin to the former; which is this, that at the &s;econd coming of CHRIST the &s;aints &s;hall obtain eternal &s;alvation; but the wicked &s;hall be turned into Hell, &s;uffering the wrath of GOD and the torments of Hell until they are purified and fit for Heaven. I have &s;aid there is a likene&s;s between them; let us con&s;ider wherein they are alike, and where|in they differ. They all preach and be|lieve one and the &s;ame go&s;pel; they all hold that CHRIST being made per|fect by &s;uffering, is become the Author of eternal &s;alvation to all them that obey him, and to all them who do not obey him. This go&s;pel does not &s;ound well; the &s;ound is better then the &s;en&s;e, for the &s;en&s;e is a mo&s;t horrible contradiction to the truth of GOD.</P>
<P>THEY agree likewi&s;e in holding the
<PB N="32" REF="018428_0031_0FA76C69CBBAC308">
ab&s;olute, infallible and eternal <HI>Salvation</HI> of the <HI>whole human race.</HI> But while others hold that <HI>Univer&s;al Salvation</HI> will be im|mediately after the &s;econd appearance of CHRIST, <HI>Origen</HI>'s people declare, that at the la&s;t day the wicked &s;hall be turned in|to Hell, and &s;uffer the wrath of GOD and the vengeance of Hell-fire for hundreds of years; and that for &s;uffering the&s;e torments &s;o long and &s;o well, and e&s;pecially for the true holine&s;s which they attain to by Hell|fire. Horrible ab&s;urdity! They are admit|ted to Heaven, although but little indebted to CHRIST, and are happy forever. This is PURGATORY! This is PURGATORY! and I may add with the Prophet, this is WICK|EDNESS. It is founded on the in&s;ufficiency of CHRIST's &s;acrifice and man's merit. <HI>Origen</HI> intended it as an engine to beat down ju&s;tification by faith only, through grace, without the deeds of the law. This is the Go&s;pel of GOD! And this is the Go&s;pel of us Prote&s;tants which ought to be dear to us as our own lives. Formerly it had been dearer to &s;ome than their own lives. When any people by hearing the word preached, or by any other means believe in Purgatory, they hope that if their lives &s;hould not be accord|ing to the Go&s;pel they &s;hall go to Heaven by the way of Purgatory. This is the common hope of tho&s;e who are called after <HI>Origin</HI>'s name: They &s;eem to have a &s;ure hope that if

they turn their backs upon godline&s;s, and &s;erve &s;a|tan till death, they &s;hall be eternally happy; and they rejoice in this hope: it is owing to the &s;ame antinomian boldne&s;s that they have decided, that all that have ever lived, or &s;hall live wicked lives in this world, &s;hall infallibly obtain &s;alvation, with eternal glory, by the idol called PURGATORY. I have called it an idol. God's word don't own it: to honour <HI>that</HI> would be to di&s;honour <HI>him.</HI> And now God, in his providence, &s;uffers that antichri&s;|tian idol to come among&s;t us prote&s;tants <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The learned Theophilus Gale a&s;&s;ures us, that when Origen preached purgatory in Alexandria, which he learned in Plato's &s;chool (not by reading his bible) he was looked on as the mo&s;t eminent man for promoting papi&s;im and antichri&s;tiani&s;m.

evil angels, &s;hould &s;often the wicked men in hell, make them real &s;aints, and lovers of an holy God. But they are not able, they have not one word to &s;ay. The doctrine which teaches that men learn to be lovers of God, by being damned in hell with the devil and his angels, is <HI>mon&s;trous!</HI> By the way, is it not &s;trange that learned divines and others who are afraid of all my&s;tery in religi|on, &s;hould &s;wallow <HI>Origen's mon&s;ter!</HI> There is no mon&s;ter in religion more hedious than this. Let us take a view ot it, how came any of us to love God, we love him in God's way, not in Origen's way. He loved us fir&s;t, and &s;ent his &s;on to be a propitiation for us. We believed the love and kindne&s;s of God and our Saviour, and returned love for love. So God tells us by his prophet Ho&s;ea, that he draws us with the cords of a man, and with the bands of love. Here is nothing but love, love, love. This divinity is from Heaven; that which teaches that we love God by being damned with devils is from beneath. We may bold|ly &s;ay it is an abomination to the Lord. Origen, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Above fourteen hundred years ago Origen turned hell into a purgatory, and ever &s;ince he and all his followers have been furni&s;hed with a purgatory, as well as the heathens; for heathens always had a purgatory. The Latin poets tell us the heathens be|lieved no other hell but a purgatory; and Origen's chri&s;tians be|lieved no other hell but a purgatory.</NOTE> the creator of Purgatory, created it: his Purgatory could not exi&s;t without it, therefore the hearty friends of purgatory are hearty friends to that reli|gion which the &s;oul of God hates.</P>
<P>One would think that the ta&s;ting of the &s;econd death and the pains of hell, in&s;tead of creating love to God would cau&s;e the haters of God to hate him

more. The &s;criptures call all wicked men haters of God, they hate him for his holine&s;s, and for his preparing a hell for the workers of iniquity; how much more then will they hate him when they open their eyes in hell, being in torments, and feel that God is a con&s;uming fire?&mdash;they will have no re&s;t day nor night, but the &s;moke of their torment will a&s;cend continually. Enmity mu&s;t therefore en|crea&s;e, by falling into the hands of the living God, and by knowing what it is to dwell with devour|ing fire. Add to this, that we are again and again told, in the book of the Revelations, what effects God's wrath and torments will have upon the wicked, viz. they will gnaw their tongues for pain, look upwards to Heaven, but will not <HI>repent</HI> of their <HI>wickedne&s;s.</HI> It is a maxim in philo&s;ophy, that the <HI>&s;ame cau&s;es</HI> will for ever produce the <HI>&s;ame effects.</HI> This therefore alone would be &s;ufficient to kill purgatory &s;tone dead, if it were not <HI>already dead.</HI> Origen's divinity is &s;ometimes contrary to &s;cripture, rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e. This is appli|cable not only to his purgatory, &amp;c. but to his doc|trine of wor&s;hipping all the angels of heaven, and praying to departed &s;aints, which duties we may &s;uppo&s;e the blind, zealous man, practi&s;ed every day. His prayer to the angels, and his prayer to St. Job, which are not without bla&s;phemy, will be pre&s;ented to the reader in a blank page at the end. Origen's wild notions in religion make up the creed of his mo&s;t &s;erious followers, though they do not come to them with a thus <HI>&s;ayeth</HI> the <HI>Lord</HI>; they come to them with a thus <HI>&s;ayeth Origen.</HI> It is &s;trange to think with what deep contempt and indignation the Ori|geni&s;ts treat their brethren, who hold that all fle&s;h &s;hall be &s;aved by Chri&s;t when he comes again, not

The author has nothing to &s;ay for them; their religion borders on athei&s;m; the partition between is <HI>but thin.</HI> Nor have they much to &s;ay for them&s;elves; but the au|thor is bound in con&s;cience to &s;ay what follows, viz. that an under&s;tanding man who reads his bible may know a&s;&s;uredly, that Univer&s;al Salvation is an heinous contradiction to the truth of God by many &s;criptures; the author will mention but one. We all know that when Chri&s;t commanded his apo&s;tles to preach &s;alvation by faith, they were to fini&s;h with the&s;e dreadful words, He that believeth not &s;hall be damned. By which words he let Ni|codemus know, that he meant, he that believeth not &s;hall peri&s;h. Our late preachers are quite con|trary to Je&s;us Chri&s;t. He who&s;e word was the word of God, declares once and again, that they that do not believe on him &s;hall peri&s;h (going to purgatory is not peri&s;hing) Chri&s;t's antagoni&s;ts &s;ay, that no unbelievers &s;hall peri&s;h, no not &s;o much as one.

and <HI>antichri&s;tian &s;tuff,</HI> calculated to &s;tupify con&s;cience, harden men's hearts, to corrupt their morals, and to make them wor&s;e and wor&s;e. They know to their grief that &s;uch divinity hath produc|ed &s;uch effects, and are per&s;uaded that it will pro|duce &s;uch effects wherever it is, and wherever it may be permitted to &s;pread and be encouraged. From what hath been &s;aid again&s;t the&s;e tenets, the word of exhortation to us all is, to beware that we be not carried away with them, if we are acquainted with our bibles we &s;hall know they are contrary to the current of &s;cripture. May we be kept from all the&s;e and all other errors, and be &s;ound in the faith. May our faith be that which is from God, which brings men to God, and makes them happy in God forever. Such was the faith of the The&s;|&s;alonians, who received the go&s;pel as the word of God, which always worketh effectually; we &s;hould be jealous over our &s;elves, le&s;t our faith &s;hould be only the effect of cu&s;tom and education; if God's word is received by us as his word, we &s;hall find it ea&s;y to tru&s;t in Chri&s;t, though our &s;ins are more in number than the hairs of our heads, and in&s;tead of trying and trying to love Chri&s;t, our hearts will be drawn out to love him, and to live to him as real &s;aints do, and we &s;hall be happy in this world, and in the world to come mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed forever. Ble&s;&s;ed be God if we have been made partakers of this precious faith. Paul, and his fellow labourers, thanked God continually for be&s;towing it on the The&s;&s;alonians, and if we have clear evidence that our faith is the &s;ame, we &s;hall thank God for it every day and hour of our lives. May the lives we live in the fle&s;h be by the faith of the Son of

God, who loved us and gave him&s;elf for us. May we be every day con&s;trained by faith and love, to live to Chri&s;t, again&s;t all oppo&s;ition from earth and hell, whereby we &s;hall an&s;wer the end of Chri&s;t's giving him&s;elf a ran&s;om for us; for he did not die merely to deliver us from hell, and the wrath to come&mdash; then he would have been the mini&s;ter of &s;in; but he died to redeem us from all iniquity, and that we might not live any longer to our &s;elves, but to him who died for our &s;in, and ro&s;e again for our ju&s;tifica|tion. All believers have been taught this religion of God. Paul &s;ays <HI>we</HI> live to the Lord, and yet how &s;mall a part of our time do we live to him! only that part when we have re&s;pect to all his com|mandments: when we keep them by his grace, and aim at his honour and glory. We have all rea&s;on to blu&s;h before our divine Ma&s;ter. May we re&s;olve, depending upon his &s;trength, that we will live to him more than ever, as long as he &s;hall hold our &s;ouls in life. And to animate us, let us con&s;ider that this is a rea&s;onable life, an honour|able life, a joyful and a ble&s;&s;ed life. 1&s;t. It is a rea&s;onable life: come now let us rea&s;on together &s;aith the Lord; and the religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is &s;aid to be a rea&s;onable &s;ervice, Rom. xii. 1 ver&s;e. Nothing can be more rea&s;onable than that we &s;hould live to Chri&s;t, who died for our &s;alvation. When wicked men gratify their lu&s;ts, they are con|demned&punc; in their own con&s;ciences, for being what the &s;cripture calls wicked and unrea&s;onable men, 2 The&s;&s;a. iii. 2. but when we live to Chri&s;t, con|&s;cience applauds for yielding a rea&s;onable &s;ervice. Nor can we ever repent of that rea&s;onable &s;ervice, whatever dangers, difficulties and per&s;ecutions may

be the con&s;equence. Nay, if we are called to &s;eal his truth with our blood, it mu&s;t be plea&s;ing to us to think that we die for his &s;ake, who loved us with a love <HI>&s;tronger than death.</HI> 2d. It is an hon|ourable life, this is the con&s;equence of its being a rea&s;onable life. The &s;cripture calls it the life of God. It is in &s;ome &s;ort &s;uch a life as they live in heaven. Whereas they who are governed by their lu&s;ts are fellow commoners with the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h. Horace calls them hogs; and Cicero calls them hor&s;es. The &s;cripture which gives to every one his ju&s;t character, &s;tyles them bruti&s;h men, P&s;al. xlix. 10 as if they were a &s;ort of <HI>quadrupeds,</HI> and accordingly, Antiochus who took upon him&s;elf the name of Epiphanes, illu&s;trious as if he out|&s;hined all the kings upon earth, is, by God, called a vile per&s;on, Dan. xi. 21. And the people of God look upon all &s;uch &s;elfi&s;h, &s;en&s;ual men, as vile per|&s;ons, though rai&s;ed to the top of the world. The &s;ame &s;cripture allows the &s;aints to be honourable: they are the only right honourable ones upon earth. What honourable names are given to them by God? &s;ome of which, are kings and prie&s;ts unto God. He al&s;o honours them internally. He &s;ays to them well done good and faithful &s;ervants. They have the applau&s;es of God and their own con&s;ciences, and are con&s;ent with the honour which comes from God alone. Mr. <HI>Hugh Peters,</HI> &s;ays, that after he was a true believer, and con&s;equently was no &s;tranger to internal honours, he never thought the honours of this world worth minding. Such men are high born: they are born from above; they are ac|quainted with high life; they look down upon crowns, &s;cepters and diadems, with contempt, as

little things which can give but &s;mall &s;atisfaction to believers, who are all men of great &s;ouls.</P>
<P>Grandeur of &s;oul for ever brings contempt of &s;ublunary things. God delights to honour them, who, like their Saviour, &s;eek not honour to them|&s;elves, he cau&s;es them to be e&s;teemed by the ex|cellent ones of the earth: who regard them much becau&s;e they do not live like the men of the world, to them&s;elves; but unto the Lord, honouring him and them&s;elves too at the &s;ame time. Nay, &s;ome|times great men who have no religion regard them much. They &s;ee in them a more excellent &s;pirit than the &s;pirit that is in the world: they &s;ee in them that tenderne&s;s of con&s;cience, and that nice &s;en&s;e of honour which they can find in no <HI>other men</HI>; and they honour them with many honours. 3d. This is a joyful and a ble&s;&s;ed life. The &s;criptures &s;peak much of the joy of believers; they rejoice greatly, they are ready to pity tho&s;e that go to the world for their joy: for it &s;eems to them comparatively, that nothing de&s;erves the name of joy, but joy in the Holy Gho&s;t. I need not &s;pend time in quoting the pa&s;&s;ages, to &s;et forth the exceeding great joys of the fir&s;t believers. Tho&s;e who read their bibles can ea&s;ily quote many of them and would not be helped by my quotations. An impor|tant que&s;tion naturally ari&s;es here, viz. whether we chri&s;tians in the&s;e days have joys and comforts equal to tho&s;e of the fir&s;t chri&s;tians. It will take &s;ome time to an&s;wer it; I hope it will not be time lo&s;t. Tho&s;e believers who have a&s;&s;urance of their ju&s;tification, which was common in tho&s;e early days, rejoice and triumph in Chri&s;t as they did; but alas! how few are there, who can adopt Paul's
<PB N="41" REF="018428_0040_0FA76C70B6811830">
triumphant language in behalf of believers: It is God who ju&s;tifies, it is Chri&s;t that died, &amp;c. &amp;c. Rom. viii. Mo&s;t &s;erious chri&s;tians will own that their religion has not made them happy, yet they at be&s;t go on between hope and fear, and mu&s;t be in bondage through fear of death. Nay, &s;ome that have rejoiced greatly and for a long time, &s;ink into the horrible pit, and into the miry clay. They go mourning without the &s;un, and refu&s;e to be com|forted. We do not learn from the apo&s;tolick writings, that any con&s;ciencious chri&s;tians were fill|ed with horrors of con&s;cience and fears of hell. To the benefit of the fir&s;t chri&s;tians a &s;ort of divinity, which exi&s;ted afterward, had no exi&s;tence then, viz. That great di&s;tre&s;&s;es and humiliations are nece&s;&s;ary to faith, and that men mu&s;t be &s;o greatly humbled as to acquie&s;ce in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, in thinking of their own damnation. As there was no &s;uch divinity then, it is rea&s;onable to think there was no &s;uch hor|rors and di&s;tre&s;&s;es among the chri&s;tians; had it been otherwi&s;e the fir&s;t enemies of Chri&s;t would have availed them&s;elves of it. They would have pro|claimed it aloud, that chri&s;tianity was enemical to the peace and quiet of mankind; that its votaries were a gloomy &s;ort of mortals, and that it would not be &s;trange if &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;erious chri&s;tians &s;hould pine away with grief, and <HI>die with their new religi|on.</HI> The &s;ilence of the apologi&s;ts is proof enough, that from the beginning it was not &s;o. The fir&s;t chri&s;tians magnified Chri&s;t by their con&s;ciencious and joyful lives. What is the rea&s;on then, that many now a-days, hang down their heads like bulru&s;hes, and by their &s;orrowful countenances and &s;ighings frighten away others from the joyful re|ligion

of Chri&s;t? they get under the law and keep under the law, with regard to the great &s;cripture doctrine of ju&s;tification by faith without works. When they believe this, as Paul and other chri&s;|tians did, there could be no di&s;tre&s;s and horrors of darkne&s;s among tho&s;e who name the name of Chri&s;t. Chri&s;tians have a &s;en&s;e of the worth of their &s;ouls, and &s;ometimes a great &s;en&s;e, but they cannot &s;ub|mit to the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of God by faith. They do not &s;eem to be holy and humble enough yet to employ the Mediator, this is a common &s;ource of trouble to &s;erious per&s;ons, &s;ometimes of long continuance; and tho&s;e who endeavour to heal them oftentimes make them more melancholly and &s;elf righteous than ever. The truth is, they keep away from the Mediator, who is the <HI>Con&s;ola|tion of I&s;rael.</HI> How then can they be <HI>comforted!</HI> There is but one way, and that is by believing the go&s;pel to be <HI>true.</HI> It will be &s;aid, Is this enough to cure all di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, melancholly, de&s;ponding chri&s;|tians through chri&s;tendom? only to believe that the go&s;pel is true, the true word of God? Mo&s;t certainly Paul tells the The&s;&s;alonians, that they who had received the go&s;pel as the word of God were true believers. The &s;ame Paul declares over and over, that all believers are tru&s;ters in Chri&s;t. If men could believe the go&s;pel to be the true and faithful word of God without tru&s;ting in Chri&s;t, he could have had no ground for the&s;e &s;inonomies; but it is impo&s;&s;ible in the nature of the thing to believe that the go&s;pel came down from heaven, without tru&s;ting in Chri&s;t. If I dare not tru&s;t in Chri&s;t becau&s;e I am &s;o great a &s;inner, I do not believe the go&s;pel is from God. When I

am convinced in my &s;oul and con&s;cience that God him&s;elf is the author of the good news, all the de|vils in hell cannot &s;top me from tru&s;ting in Chri&s;t one moment longer. This was Paul's own expe|rience, when he believed God him&s;elf was the au|thor of the news, that the chief of &s;inners were wel|come to &s;alvation. He tru&s;ted in Chri&s;t that mo|ment, without &s;taying to <HI>&s;ee him&s;elf better.</HI> There is not that man living upon the face of God's earth, who knows that he hath tru&s;ted in Chri&s;t, and when he began to tru&s;t in him, but will own that he tru&s;ted in him not as a &s;aint, nor as a piece of a &s;aint, but as a &s;inner. We have proved that all that have received the go&s;pel as the word of God, are <HI>tru&s;ters in Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>; and we know the &s;crip|tures are full of expre&s;&s;ions of the joy, peace and comfort of tho&s;e who tru&s;t in him. Sometimes they are &s;aid to be filled with joy, and their joy is &s;aid to be un&s;peakable and glorious. But peace, re&s;t and comfort are every where &s;aid to be the experi|ence of tho&s;e who tru&s;t that through the grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they them&s;elves &s;hall be &s;av|ed. The point therefore is &s;ettled, that all dejec|ted, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and de&s;ponding chri&s;tians mu&s;t be comforted, when they are taught of God to believe, that the go&s;pel is his very word. Doubts and di&s;|tre&s;&s;es mu&s;t all flee away like darkne&s;s before the &s;un. For then they will &s;ee that the wor&s;t men and women out of hell, if they want nothing but the death of Chri&s;t to recommend them, will be accep|ted of God; they them&s;elves want nothing but the death of Chri&s;t. This is making the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t their tru&s;t, before, they were afraid to tru&s;t him, it may be for years together; but now the

number and greatne&s;s of their &s;ins do not keep them away. Nay, if be&s;ides all their other guilt they have been murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, &s;uch complicated wickedne&s;s could not di&s;courage them from making Chri&s;t their tru&s;t.

with it? Ble&s;&s;ed be God for it, the more we are acquainted with it, the more we &s;hall glorify him. God is glorified by the way in which we attain to it, and by the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s it&s;elf. He is glorified in the way by which it is attained: it is by faith, by &s;trong faith, and faith, e&s;pecially &s;trong faith, is for the glory of God. Strong love accompanies &s;uch faith. We &s;hall be con&s;trained to yield that ex|act obedience to the commands of God which no man can yield, who keeps them to be ju&s;tified by them. Our Saviour &s;ays, when we bring forth much fruit, our heavenly Father is glorified by us; and &s;peaking of him&s;elf &s;ays, I am glorified in them. Chri&s;t will manife&s;t him&s;elf to them, and God will &s;hine into their &s;ouls, and cau&s;e them to know that his loving kindne&s;s is better than life. And this ble&s;&s;edne&s;s will be for the glory of God, and the honour of Chri&s;t's divine religion. When men are full of worldly joy they cannot hide it&mdash;when men are filled with joy in the Holy Gho&s;t, it cannot be concealed from their acquaintance. Humility will not conceal it: the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, will comfort the humble and con|trite. Humility is the &s;piritual vacuum; the more any are emptied of them&s;elves, the more will they be filled with the joys of heaven. Others therefore beholding them, and &s;eeing that they live in all good con&s;cience, and go on their way to heaven re|joicing, may be convinced that God is with them of a truth, and glorify God with them in the day of their vi&s;itation, whereby they will be partakers with them in their joys while in this world, and in the ever|la&s;ting joys of the kingdom of Heaven, which God of his infinite mercy grant may be the portion of us all for Je&s;us Chri&s;t's &s;ake.</P>

<HEAD>ORIGEN's Form of Prayer to Angels:</HEAD>
<P>COME, O Angel, receive one, in word, con|verted from his former error, from the doc|trine of devils, from iniquity, &s;peaking highly; and receiving him as a good phy&s;ician&mdash;Cheri&s;h and in&s;truct him; he is a little one, he is born to day, an old man growing young again; and receive, retributing to him, the bapti&s;m of the &s;econd rege|neration; and call to thee other companions of thy mini&s;try that all ye equally may in&s;truct in the faith who were &s;ometimes deceived.</P>
