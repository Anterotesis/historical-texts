<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE candid reception of a &s;mall volume of Inquiries and Ob&s;ervations, publi&s;h|ed in the year 1788, has encouraged me to offer a &s;econd to the public, with the &s;ame ti|tle. Three of the inquiries were publi&s;hed &s;everal years ago; two <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The inquiry into the influence of phy&s;ical cau&s;es on the moral faculty, and the inquiry into the influence of &s;pi|rituous liquors upon the human body, &amp;c.</NOTE> of them in pam|phlets, and the third<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The inquiry into the cau&s;es of the increa&s;e of bilious and intermitting fevers in Penn&s;ylvania.</NOTE> in the &s;econd volume of the American Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions. They are now republi&s;hed, in their pre&s;ent form, at the reque&s;t of &s;everal of my friends, with the addition, chiefly, of a few notes.</P>
<P>I AM aware of the fate of every attempt to introduce new opinions into medicine. My apology for this attempt in &s;ome of the fol|lowing e&s;&s;ays is, that I believe the want of &s;ucce&s;s in the treatment of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es
<PB N="ii" REF="026112_0004_0FCFF44F1556E7E8">
which are thought to be incurable, is occa&s;i|oned, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, by an attachment to &s;uch theories as are imperfect or erroneous. I do not &s;ay, by a want of theory altogether, for it is impo&s;&s;ible for a phy&s;ician to pre&s;cribe, without a theory of &s;ome kind. I believe further, after all that has been &s;aid again&s;t theory, and in favour of &s;imple ob&s;ervation in medicine, that uniform and complete &s;uc|ce&s;s can never be attained, but by combining with ob&s;ervation a perfect knowledge of all the cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es. Perhaps it would be equally ju&s;t to a&s;&s;ert, that ob&s;ervation will always be exten&s;ive, accurate, and u&s;eful, in proportion as it is directed by principles in medicine.</P>
<P>I HAVE one more excu&s;e to offer for my temerity in propo&s;ing the new opinions which are contained in the following inquiries, and that is, they were not &s;ought for, but obtru|ded upon me, and that too in &s;pite of a con|viction of the certain lo&s;s of reputation which follows a change of opinion upon any &s;ubject; for I well knew the world was not di&s;po&s;ed to admit as a ju&s;tification of this change, that
<PB N="iii" REF="026112_0005_0FCFF4509AE77768">
it is always the nece&s;&s;ary effect of the di&s;co|very or adoption of new truths; and that &s;ta|bility in principles and practice, in an imper|fect &s;cience, is, for the mo&s;t part, the effect of a timid or &s;lothful per&s;everance in ignorance or error.</P>
<P>IN departing in &s;ome things from the &s;y|&s;tem of Dr. Cullen, in which I was educated, I do not relinqui&s;h the whole of his princi|ples, much le&s;s do I reject indi&s;criminately the &s;y&s;tems of authors, whether ancient or modern, of le&s;s reputation. Truth in medi|cine, as far as it has been di&s;covered, like truth in religion, appears to exi&s;t in greater or le&s;s proportions in different &s;y&s;tems; but the fabric which &s;hall include a knowledge of the cau&s;es and cure of every di&s;ea&s;e, remains yet to be completed, by an application to its unfi|ni&s;hed parts, of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive labors of Phy|&s;icians in generations, or perhaps ages, yet to come.</P>
<P>HAD I yielded to per&s;onal con&s;iderations, I &s;hould have kept the&s;e papers a few years longer from the public eye, in order that they
<PB N="iv" REF="026112_0006_0FCF4963162E15D8">
might have become more correct from the influence which time alone exerts upon all literary performances; but I have preferred at every hazard, fending them thus early into the world, from a de&s;ire that my opinions and practice may be corrected, or &s;upported, by the auxiliary ob&s;ervations and rea&s;onings of my medical brethren; and that &s;everal formidable di&s;ea&s;es may thereby be oppo&s;ed, not by an individual only, but by the confe|derated exertions of men of different talents, and &s;ituations, in every part of the republic of medicine.</P>
<P>I HAD another rea&s;on for committing the&s;e E&s;&s;ays to the pre&s;s, in their pre&s;ent immature &s;tate, and that was, I have ob&s;erved freedom in thinking, to be nece&s;&s;arily connected with freedom in communicating the re&s;ult of in|quiries after truth. I con&s;ider this volume therefore, with all its imperfections, as a pledge of equal boldne&s;s, and I hope, of more &s;ucce&s;s, in all future inve&s;tigations.</P>

<HEAD>AN INQUIRY INTO THE INFLUENCE OF PHYSICAL CAUSES UPON THE MORAL FACULTY, DELIVERED BEFORE THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY, Held in Philadelphia, on the 27th of February, 1786.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was for the landable purpo&s;e of exciting a &s;pi|rit of emulation and enquiry, among the mem|bers of our body, that the founders of our &s;ociety, in&s;tituted an annual oration. The ta&s;k of prepa|ring, and delivering this exerci&s;e, hath devolved, once more, upon me. I have &s;ubmitted to it, not becau&s;e I thought my&s;elf capable of fulfilling your intentions, but becau&s;e I wi&s;hed, by a te&s;timony of my obedience to your reque&s;ts, to atone for my long ab&s;ence from the temple of &s;cience.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubject upon which I am to have the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you this evening, is <Q>An enquiry in|to
<PB N="2" REF="026112_0008_0FCFF45456F5BF20">
the influence of phy&s;ical cau&s;es upon the mo|ral faculty.</Q></P>
<P>BY the moral faculty I mean a power in the hu|man mind of di&s;tingui&s;hing and chu&s;ing good and evil, or in other words, virtue and vice. It is a native principle, and though it be capable of im|provement by experience and reflection, it is not derived from either of them.&mdash;St. Paul, and Ci|cero, give us the mo&s;t perfect account of it that is to be found in modern or ancient authors. <Q>For when the Gentiles, (&s;ays St. Paul) which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, <HI>the&s;e,</HI> having not the law, are a <HI>law</HI> unto them&s;elves; which &s;hew the works of the law written in their hearts, their con&s;ciences al&s;o bearing witne&s;s, and their thoughts the mean while accu&s;ing, or el&s;e excu&s;ing another.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom i. 14.15.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE words of Cicero are as follow&mdash;<Q>E&s;t igi|tur haec, judices, non &s;cripta, &s;ed nata lex, quam non didicimus, accepimus, legimus, verum ex na|tura ip&s;a arripuimus, hau&s;imus, expre&s;&s;imus, ad quam non docti, &s;ed facti, non in&s;tituti, &s;ed imbuti &s;umus.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Oratio pro Milone.</NOTE> This faculty is often confounded with &s;cience, which is a di&s;tinct and independent power of the mind. This is evident from the pa&s;&s;age
<PB N="3" REF="026112_0009_0FCFF456871BE688">
quoted from the writings of St. Paul, in which con&s;cience is &s;aid to be the witne&s;s that accu&s;es or excu&s;es us, of a breach of the law written in our hearts. The moral faculty is what the &s;choolmen call the "regula regulans,"&mdash;the con&s;cience is their "regula regulata." Or, to &s;peak in more modern terms, the moral faculty performs the office of a law|giver, while the bu&s;ine&s;s of con&s;cience is to perform the duty of a judge. The moral faculty is to the con&s;cience, what ta&s;te is to the judgment, and &s;en&s;ation to perception. It is quick in its opera|tions, and like the &s;en&s;ative plant, acts without re|flection, while con&s;cience follows with deliberate &s;teps, and mea&s;ures all her actions, by the unerring &s;quare of right and wrong. The moral faculty exerci&s;es it&s;elf upon the actions of others. It ap|proves even in books, of the virtues of a Trajan, and di&s;approves of the vices of a Marius, while con&s;cience confines its operations, only to its own actions. The&s;e two powers of the mind are gene|rally in an exact ratio to each other, but they &s;ometimes exi&s;t in different degrees in the &s;ame per|&s;on. Hence we often find con&s;cience in its full vigor, with a dimini&s;hed tone, or total ab&s;ence of the moral faculty.</P>
<P>IT has long been a que&s;tion among metaphy&s;ici|ans, whether the con&s;cience be &s;eated in the will or in the under&s;tanding. The controver&s;y can on|ly
<PB N="4" REF="026112_0010_0FCFF4574CC0BD70">
be &s;ettled by admitting the will to be the &s;eat of the moral faculty, and the under&s;tanding to be the &s;eat of the con&s;cience. The my&s;terious nature of the union of tho&s;e two moral principles with the will and under&s;tanding, is a &s;ubject foreign to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the pre&s;ent enquiry.&mdash;</P>
<P>AS I con&s;ider virtue and vice to con&s;i&s;t in <HI>action,</HI> and not in opinion, and as this action has its &s;eat in the <HI>will,</HI> and not in the con&s;cience, I &s;hall confine my enquiries chiefly to the influence of phy&s;ical cau&s;es upon that moral power of the mind, which is connected with volition, although many of the&s;e cau&s;es act likewi&s;e upon the con&s;cience, as I &s;hall &s;hew hereafter.&mdash;The &s;tate of the moral fa|culty is vi&s;ible in actions, which affect the well-be|ing of &s;ociety. The &s;tate of the con&s;cience is in|vi&s;ible, and therefore removed beyond our inve&s;ti|gation.</P>
<P>THE moral faculty has received different names from different authors. It is the "moral &s;en&s;e" of Dr. Hutchi&s;on&mdash;the "&s;ympathy" of Dr. Adam Smith&mdash;the "moral in&s;tinct" of Rou&s;&s;eau&mdash;and "the light that lighteth every man that cometh in|to the world" of St John. I have adopted the term of moral faculty from Dr. Beattie, becau&s;e I conceive it conveys with the mo&s;t per&s;picuity, the
<PB N="5" REF="026112_0011_0FCFF45C8B47EC98">
idea of a power in the mind, of chu&s;ing good and evil.</P>
<P>OUR books of medicine contain many records of the effects of phy&s;ical cau&s;es upon the memory&mdash; the imagination&mdash;and the judgment. In &s;ome in|&s;tances we behold their operation only on one,&mdash; in others on two,&mdash;and in many ca&s;es upon the whole of the&s;e faculties. Their derangement has received different names, according to the number or nature of the faculties that are affected. The lo&s;s of memory has been called "amne&s;ia"&mdash;fal&s;e judgement upon one &s;ubject has been called "me|lancholia"&mdash;fal&s;e judgement upon all &s;ubjects has been called "mania"&mdash;and a defect of all the three intellectual faculties that have been mentioned, has received the name of "amentia." Per&s;ons who labour under the derangement, or want of the&s;e powers of the mind, are con&s;idered, very properly, as &s;ubjects of medicine; and there are many ca&s;es upon record that prove, that their di&s;ea&s;es have yielded to the healing art.</P>
<P>IN order to illu&s;trate the effects of phy&s;ical cau&s;es upon the moral faculty, it will be nece&s;|&s;ary <HI>fir&s;t</HI> to &s;hew their effects upon the memory&mdash; the imagination and the judgment; and at the &s;ame time to point out the analogy between their opera|tion
<PB N="6" REF="026112_0012_0FCFF45D9C520BB8">
upon the intellectual powers of the mind, and the moral faculty.</P>
<P N="1">1. DO we ob&s;erve a connection between the intellectual powers, and the degrees of con&s;i&s;tency and firmne&s;s of the brain in infancy and child|hood?&mdash;The &s;ame connection has been ob&s;erved between the &s;trength as well as the progre&s;s of the moral faculty in children.</P>
<P N="2">2. DO we ob&s;erve a certain &s;ize of the brain, and a peculiar ca&s;t of features, &s;uch as the pro|minent eye, and the aquiline no&s;e, to be connected with extraordinary portions of genius?&mdash;We ob|&s;erve a &s;imilar connection between the figure and temperament of the body, and certain moral facul|ties.&mdash;Hence, we often a&s;cribe good temper and benevolence to corpulency, and ira&s;cibility to &s;anguineous habits. Cae&s;ar thought him&s;elf &s;afe in the friend&s;hip of the "&s;leek-headed" Anthony and Dolabella; but was afraid to tru&s;t to the pro|fe&s;&s;ions of the &s;lender Ca&s;&s;ius.</P>
<P N="3">3. DO we ob&s;erve certain degrees of the intel|tectual faculties to be hereditary in certain fa|milies? The &s;ame ob&s;ervation has been frequently extended to moral qualities&mdash;Hence we often find certain virtues and vices as peculiar to families, through all their degrees of con&s;anguinity, and
<PB N="7" REF="026112_0013_0FCFF45EE9B00710">
duration, as a peculiarity of voice&mdash;complexion&mdash; or &s;hape.</P>
<P N="4">4. DO we ob&s;erve in&s;tances of a total want of memory&mdash;imagination&mdash;and judgment, either from an original defect in the &s;tamina of the brain, or from the influence of phy&s;ical cau&s;es?&mdash;The &s;ame unnatural defect is &s;ometimes ob&s;erved, and probably from the &s;ame cau&s;es, of a moral faculty. The celebrated Servin who&s;e character is drawn by the Duke of Sully in his Memoirs, appears to be an in&s;tance of the total ab&s;ence of the moral faculty, while the cha&s;m, produced by this defect, &s;eems to have been filled up by a more than com|mon exten&s;ion of every other power of his mind. I beg leave to repeat the hi&s;tory of this prodigy of vice and knowledge.&mdash;<Q>Let the reader re|pre&s;ent to him&s;elf a man of a genius &s;o lively, and of an under&s;tanding &s;o exten&s;ive, as rendered him &s;carce ignorant of any thing that could be known &mdash;of &s;o va&s;t and ready a comprehen&s;ion, that he immediately made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of whatever he attempted&mdash;and of &s;o prodigious a memory, that he never forgot what he once learned. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all parts of philo&s;ophy, and the ma|thematics, particularly fortification and drawing. Even in theology he was &s;o well &s;killed, that he was an excellent preacher, whenever he had
<PB N="8" REF="026112_0014_0FCFF4640AC71820">
a mind to exert that talent, and an able di&s;put|ant, for and again&s;t the reformed religion indif|ferently. He not only under&s;tood Greek&mdash;He|brew&mdash; and all the languages which we call learned, but al&s;o all the different jargons, or modern dialects. He accented and pronounced them &s;o naturally, and &s;o perfectly imitated the ge&s;tures and manners both of the &s;everal nations of Europe, and the particular provinces of France, that he might have been taken for a native of all, or any of the&s;e countries: and this quality he applied to counterfeit all &s;orts of per|&s;ons, wherein he &s;ucceeded wonderfully. He was moreover the be&s;t comedian, and the greate&s;t droll that perhaps ever appeared. He had a ge|nius for poetry, and had wrote many ver&s;es. He played upon almo&s;t all in&s;truments&mdash;was a perfect ma&s;ter of mu&s;ic&mdash;and &s;ung mo&s;t agree|ably and ju&s;tly. He likewi&s;e could &s;ay ma&s;s, for he was of a di&s;po&s;ition to do, as well as to know, all things. His body was perfectly well &s;uited to his mind. He was light, nimble, and dexterous, and fit for all exerci&s;es. He could ride well, and in dancing, wre&s;tling, and leap|ing, he was admired. There are not any re|creative games that he did not know, and he was &s;killed in almo&s;t all mechanic arts.&mdash;But now for the rever&s;e of the medal. Here it ap|peared,
<PB N="9" REF="026112_0015_0FCFF46594202538">
that he was treacherous&mdash;cruel&mdash;cow|ardly&mdash;deceitful&mdash;a liar&mdash;a cheat&mdash;a drunkard and a glutton&mdash;a &s;harper in play&mdash;immer&s;ed in every &s;pecies of vice&mdash;a bla&s;phemer&mdash;an athei&s;t. &mdash;In a word, in him might be found all the the vices that are contrary to nature&mdash;honour&mdash; religion&mdash;and &s;ociety,&mdash;the truth of which he him&s;elf evinced with his late&s;t breath; for he died in the flower of his age, in a common bro|thel, perfectly corrupted by his debaucheries, and expired with the gla&s;s in his hand, cur&s;ing, and denying God<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. III. p. 216.217.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>IT was probably a &s;tate of the human mind &s;uch as have been de&s;cribed, that our Saviour alluded to in the di&s;ciple, who was about to betray him, when he called him "a devil." Perhaps the e&s;&s;ence of depravity in infernal &s;pirits, con&s;i&s;ts in their being wholly devoid of a moral faculty. In them the will has probably lo&s;t the power of chu&s;ing<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Milton &s;eems to have been of this opinion. Hence, after a&s;cribing repentance to Satan, he makes him declare,<Q><L>"Farewell remor&s;e: all good to me is lo&s;t,</L><L><HI>"Evil,</HI> be thou my <HI>good."</HI>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</L><BIBL>PARADISE LOST, Book IV</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, as well as the capacity of enjoying moral good. It is true, we read of their trembling in a belief of the exi&s;tence of a God, and of their anticipating future puni&s;hment
<PB N="10" REF="026112_0016_0FCF4968EF911FC0">
by a&s;king, whether they were to be tormented be|fore their time: But this is the effect of con&s;ci|ence, and hence ari&s;es another argument in favour of this judicial power of the mind, being di&s;tinct from the moral faculty. It would &s;eem as if the Supreme Being had pre&s;erved the moral faculty in man from the ruins of his fall, on purpo&s;e to guide him back again to Paradi&s;e, and at the &s;ame time had con&s;tituted the con&s;cience, both in men and in fallen &s;pirits, a kind of royalty in his moral empire, on purpo&s;e to &s;hew his property in all in|telligent creatures, and their original re&s;emblance to him&s;elf. Perhaps the e&s;&s;ence of moral depra|vity in man con&s;i&s;ts in a total, but temporary &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion of the power of con&s;cience. Per&s;ons in this &s;ituation are emphatically &s;aid in the &s;criptures to be "pa&s;t feeling"&mdash;and to have their con&s;ci|ences feared, with a "hot iron"&mdash;they are likewi&s;e &s;aid to be "twice dead"&mdash;that is, the &s;ame torpor or moral in&s;en&s;ibility, has &s;eized both the moral faculty and the con&s;cience.</P>
<P N="5">5. DO we ever ob&s;erve in&s;tances of the exi&s;tence of only <HI>one</HI> of the three intellectual powers of the mind that have been named, in the ab&s;ence of the other two? We ob&s;erve &s;omething of the &s;ame kind with re&s;pect to the moral faculty. I once knew a man, who di&s;covered no one mark of rea|&s;on,
<PB N="11" REF="026112_0017_0FCFF467DD999748">
who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the moral &s;en&s;e or faculty in &s;o high a degree, that he &s;pent his whole life in acts of benevolence. He was not only inoffen&s;ive, (which is not always the ca&s;e with idiots) but he was kind and affectionate to every body. He had no ideas of time, but what were &s;ugge&s;ted to him by the returns of the &s;tated periods for public wor|&s;hip, in which he appeared to take great delight. He &s;pent &s;everal hours of every day in devotion, in which he was &s;o careful to be private, that he was once found in the mo&s;t improbable place in the world for that purpo&s;e, viz. in an oven.</P>
<P N="6">6. DO we ob&s;erve the memory, the imagina|tion and the judgment, to be affected by di&s;ea&s;es, particularly by fevers and madne&s;s? Where is the phy&s;ician, who has not &s;een the moral faculty af|fected from the &s;ame cau&s;es! How often do we &s;ee the temper wholly changed by a fit of &s;ick|ne&s;s! And now often do we hear per&s;ons of the mo&s;t delicate virtue, utter &s;peeches in the delirium of a fever, that are offen&s;ive to decency, or good manners! I have heard a well atte&s;ted hi&s;tory of a clergyman of the mo&s;t exemplary moral charac|ter, who &s;pent the la&s;t moments of a fever which deprived him both of his rea&s;on and his life, in profane cur&s;ing and &s;wearing. I once attended a young woman in a nervous fever, who di&s;covered

Happily for the human race, the intimations of duty and the road to happine&s;s are not left to the &s;low opera|tions or doubtful inductions of rea&s;on, nor to the precarious deci&s;ions of ta&s;te!

It is worthy of notice like|wi&s;e, that while <HI>&s;econd</HI> thoughts are be&s;t in mat|ters of judgment, <HI>fir&s;t</HI> thoughts are always to be preferred in matters that relate to morality. <HI>Se|cond</HI> thoughts, in the&s;e ca&s;es, are generally parlies between duty and corrupted inclinations.

Ira&s;cibility&mdash;levity&mdash;timidity&mdash;and indolence, tempered with occa&s;ional emotions of benevo|lence, are the moral qualities of the inhabitants of warm climates, while &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s tempered with &s;incerity and integrity, form the moral cha|racter of the inhabitants of cold countries.&mdash; The &s;tate of the weather, and the &s;ea&s;ons of the year al&s;o, have a vi&s;ible effect upon moral &s;en&s;ibility.

"Fullne&s;s of bread," we are told, was one of the predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;es of the vices of the cities of the plain. The fa&s;ts &s;o often inculcated among the Jews, were intended to le&s;|&s;en the incentives to vice; for pride&mdash;cruelty&mdash; and &s;en&s;uality, are as much the natural con&s;e|quences of luxury, as apoplexies and pal&s;ies. But the <HI>quality</HI> as well as the quantity of aliment, has an influence upon morals; hence we find the mo|ral di&s;ea&s;es that have been mentioned, are mo&s;t frequently the offspring of animal food. The prophet I&s;aiah &s;eems to have been &s;en&s;ible of this, when he a&s;cribes &s;uch &s;alutary effects to a tempe|rate and vegetable diet. "Butter and honey &s;hall he eat," &s;ays he, <HI>"that</HI> he may know to refu&s;e the evil, and to chu&s;e the good."&mdash;But we have many facts which prove the efficacy of a vegeta|ble diet upon the pa&s;&s;ions.

The effects of &s;teady labor in early life, in creating virtuous habits, is &s;till more remarkable. The late Anthony Benezet of this city, who&s;e benevolence was the &s;entinel of the virtue, as well as of the happine&s;s of his country, made it a con&s;tant rule in binding out poor children, to avoid putting them into wealthy families, but always preferred ma|&s;ters for them who worked them&s;elves, and who obliged the&s;e children to work in their pre&s;ence. If the habits of virtue, contracted by means of this apprentice&s;hip to labor, are purely mechanical, their effects are, neverthele&s;s, the &s;ame upon the happine&s;s of &s;ociety, as if they flowed from prin|ciple.

THE effects of EXCESSIVE SLEEP are intimate|ly connected with the effects of idlene&s;s upon the moral faculty,&mdash;hence we find that moderate, and even &s;canty portions of &s;leep, in every part of the world, have been found to be friendly, not only to health and long life, but in many in&s;tances to morality. The practice of the Monks, who of|ten &s;leep upon a floor, and who generally ri&s;e with the &s;un, for the &s;ake of mortifying their &s;en&s;ual ap|petites, is certainly founded in wi&s;dom, and has of|ten produced the mo&s;t &s;alutary moral effects.</P>
<P N="8">8. THE effects of BODILY PAIN upon the mo|ral, are not le&s;s remarkable than upon the intel|lectual powers of the mind. The late Dr Gregory, of the univer&s;ity of Edinburgh, u&s;ed to tell his pupils, that he always found his perceptions quick|er in a fit of the gout, than at any other time. The pangs which attend the di&s;&s;olution of the body, are often accompanied with conceptions and expre&s;&s;ions upon the mo&s;t ordinary &s;ubjects, that di&s;cover an uncommon elevation of the intellectual powers. The effects of bodily pain are exactly the &s;ame in rou&s;ing and directing the moral facul|ty. Bodily pain, we find, was one of the reme|dies employed in the Old Te&s;tament, for extirpat|ing vice and promoting virtue: and Mr Howard tells us, that he &s;aw it employed &s;ucce&s;sfully as a
<PB N="30" REF="026112_0036_0FCFF49B317F3BF0">
means of reformation, in one of the pri&s;ons which he vi&s;ited. If pain has a phy&s;ical tendency to cure vice, I &s;ubmit it to the con&s;ideration of parents and legi&s;lators, whether moderate degrees of cor|poral puni&s;hments, inflicted for a great length of time, would not be more medicinal in their effects, than the violent degrees of them, which are of &s;hort duration.</P>
<P N="9">9. TOO much cannot be &s;aid in favour of CLEANLINESS, as a phy&s;ical means of promoting virtue. The writings of Mo&s;es have been called by military men, the be&s;t "orderly book" in the world. In every part of them we find cleanline&s;s inculcated with as much zeal, as if it was part of the moral, in&s;tead of the levitical law. Now, it is well-known, that the principal de&s;ign of every pre|cept and rite of the ceremonial parts of the Jew|i&s;h religion, was to prevent vice, and to promote virtue. All writers upon the lepro&s;y, take notice of its connection with a certain vice. To this di&s;|ea&s;e gro&s;s animal food, particularly &s;wine's fle&s;h, and a dirty &s;kin, have been thought to be predi&s;po|&s;ing cau&s;es&mdash;hence the rea&s;on, probably, why pork was forbidden, and why ablutions of the body and limbs were &s;o frequently inculcated by the Jewi&s;h law. Sir John Pringle's remarks, in his Oration upon Captain Cook's Voyage, deli|vered

Such (meaning the &s;hip's crew) as were made more cleanly, became more &s;ober, more orderly, and more attentive to duty.</Q> The benefit to be derived by parents and &s;choolma&s;ters from attending to the&s;e facts, is too obvious to be mentioned.</P>
<P N="10">10. I hope I &s;hall be excu&s;ed in placing SO|LITUDE among the phy&s;ical cau&s;es which influ|ence the moral faculty, when I add, that I confine its effects to per&s;ons who are irreclaimable by ra|tional or moral remedies. Mr Howard informs us, that the chaplain of the pri&s;on at Liege in Germany a&s;&s;ured him, <Q>that the mo&s;t refractory and turbulent &s;pirits, became tractable and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive, by being clo&s;ely confined for four or five days.</Q>&mdash;In bodies that are predi&s;po&s;ed to vice, the &s;timulus of cheerful, but much more of pro|fane &s;ociety and conver&s;ation, upon the animal &s;pi|rits, becomes an exciting cau&s;e, and like the &s;troke of the flint upon the &s;teel, renders the &s;parks of vice both active and vi&s;ible. By removing men out of the reach of this exciting cau&s;e, they are often re|formed, e&s;pecially if they are confined long enough
<PB N="32" REF="026112_0038_0FCFF49E8DB9CF28">
to produce a &s;ufficient cha&s;m in their habits of vice. Where the benefit of reflection, and in&s;truction from books, can be added to &s;olitude and confine|ment, their good effects are &s;till more certain. To this philo&s;ophers and poets in every age have a&s;|&s;ented, by de&s;cribing the life of a hermit as a life of pa&s;&s;ive virtue.</P>
<P N="11">11. CONNECTED with &s;olitude, as a mechanical means of promoting virtue, SILENCE de&s;erves to be mentioned in this place. The late Dr Fother|gill, in his plan of education for that benevolent in&s;titution at Ackworth, which was the la&s;t care of his u&s;eful life, &s;ays every thing that can be &s;aid in favour of this nece&s;&s;ary di&s;cipline, in the follow-words. <Q>To habituate children from their early infancy, to &s;ilence and attention, is of the great|e&s;t advantage to them, not only as a preparative to their advancement in a religious life, but as the groundwork of a well cultivated under|&s;tanding. To have the active minds of children put under a kind of re&s;traint&mdash;to be accu&s;tomed to turn their attention from external objects, and habituated to a degree of ab&s;tracted quiet, is a matter of great con&s;equence, and la&s;ting be|nefit to them. Although it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that young and active minds are always engaged in &s;ilence as they ought to be, yet to be accu&s;|tomed
<PB N="33" REF="026112_0039_0FCF496CE8B4CAA8">
thus to quietne&s;s, is no &s;mall point gained towards fixing a habit of patience, and recollec|tion, which &s;eldom for&s;akes tho&s;e who have been properly in&s;tructed in this entrance of the &s;chool of wi&s;dom, during the re&s;idue of their days.</Q></P>
<P>FOR the purpo&s;e of acquiring this branch of educa|tion, children cannot a&s;&s;ociate too early, nor too often with their parents, or with their &s;uperiors in age, rank, and wi&s;dom.</P>
<P N="12">12. THE effects of mu&s;ic upon the moral faculty, have been felt and recorded in every country. Hence we are able to di&s;cover the virtues and vi|ces of different nations, by their tunes, as certainly as by their laws. The effects of mu&s;ic, when &s;im|ply mechanical, upon the pa&s;&s;ions, are powerful and exten&s;ive. But it remains yet to determine the degrees of moral ec&s;ta&s;y, that may be produ|ced by an attack upon the ear, the rea&s;on, and the moral principle, at the &s;ame time, by the com|bined powers of mu&s;ic and eloquence.</P>
<P N="13">13. THE eloquence of the pulpit is nearly allied to mu&s;ic in its effects upon the moral faculty. It is true, there can be no permanent change in the temper, and moral conduct of a man, that is not derived from the under&s;tanding and the will; but
<PB N="34" REF="026112_0040_0FCFF49F5DFA9B38">
we mu&s;t remember, that the&s;e two powers of the mind are mo&s;t a&s;&s;ailable, when they are attacked through the avenue of the pa&s;&s;ions; and the&s;e, we know, when agitated by the powers of eloquence, exert a mechanical action upon every power of the &s;oul. Hence we find in every age and country, where chri&s;tianity has been propagated, the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed orators have generally been the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful reformers of mankind. There mu&s;t be a defect of eloquence in a preacher, who with the re&s;ources for oratory, which are contained in the Old and New Te&s;taments, does not produce in every man who hears him, at lea&s;t a temporary love of virtue. I grant that the eloquence of the pulpit alone, cannot change men into chri&s;tians, but it certainly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the power of changing brutes into men. Could the eloquence of the &s;tage be properly directed, it is impo&s;&s;ible to con|ceive the extent of its mechanical effects upon mo|rals. The language and imagery of a Shake&s;peare, upon moral and religious &s;ubjects, poured upon the pa&s;&s;ions and the &s;en&s;es, in all the beauty and va|riety of dramatic repre&s;entation! Who could re&s;i&s;t, or de&s;cribe their effects?</P>
<P N="14">14. ODORS of various kinds have been ob&s;erv|ed to act in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible manner upon the mo|ral faculty. Brydone tells us, upon the authority of a celebrated philo&s;opher in Italy, that the pecu|liar

wickedne&s;s of the people who live in the neigh|bourhood of Aetna and Ve&s;uvius, is occa&s;ioned chiefly by the &s;mell of the &s;ulphur and of the hot exhalations which are con&s;tantly di&s;charged from tho&s;e volcanos. Agreeable odors, &s;eldom fail to in&s;pire &s;erenity, and to compo&s;e the angry &s;pirits&mdash; Hence the plea&s;ure, and one of the advantages of a flower garden. The &s;moke of tobacco is likewi&s;e of a compo&s;ing nature, and tends not only to pro|duce what is called a train in perception, but to hu&s;h the agitated pa&s;&s;ions into &s;ilence and order&mdash; Hence the propriety of connecting the pipe or &s;e|gar and the bottle together, in public company.</P>

IT is to be lamented, that no experiments have as yet been made, to determine the effects of all the different &s;pecies of Airs, which chemi&s;try has lately di&s;covered, upon the moral faculty.

But I will not blend facts with conjectures. Clouds and darkne&s;s &s;till hang upon this part of my &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>LET it not be &s;u&s;pected from any thing that I have delivered, that I &s;uppo&s;e the influence of phy|&s;ical cau&s;es upon the moral faculty, renders the agency of divine influence unnece&s;&s;ary to our mo|ral happine&s;s. I only maintain, that the opera|tions of the divine government are carried on in the moral, as in the natural world, by the in&s;tru|mentality of &s;econd cau&s;es. I have only trodden in the foot&s;teps of the in&s;pired writers; for mo&s;t of the phy&s;ical cau&s;es I have enumerated, are con|nected with moral precepts, or have been u&s;ed as the means of reformation from vice, in the Old and New Te&s;taments. To the ca&s;es that have been mentioned I &s;hall only add, that Nebuchad|nezzar was cured of his pride, by means of &s;olitude
<PB N="37" REF="026112_0043_0FCFF4A46BEE79A8">
and a vegetable diet.&mdash;Saul was cured of his evil &s;pirit, by means of David's harp, and St. Paul ex|pre&s;sly &s;ays, <Q>I keep my body under, and bring it into &s;ubjection, le&s;t that by any means, when I have preached to others, I my&s;elf &s;hould be a ca&s;t-away.</Q> But I will go one &s;tep further, and add in favor of divine influence upon the moral principle, that in tho&s;e extraordinary ca&s;es, where bad men are &s;uddenly reformed, without the in|&s;trumentality of phy&s;ical, moral, or rational cau&s;es, I believe that the organization of tho&s;e parts of the body, which form the link that binds it to the &s;oul, undergoes a phy&s;ical change;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. Paul was &s;uddenly transformed from a per&s;ecutor into a man of a gentle and amiable &s;pirit.

It is probably the beginning of that perfect renovation of the human body, which is predicted by St Paul in the following words&mdash;<Q>For our conver&s;ation is in heaven, from whence we look for the Savi|our,

<P>I cannot help remarking under this head, that if the conditions of tho&s;e parts of the human body which are connected with the human &s;oul, influence morals, the &s;ame rea&s;on may be given for a virtu|ous education, that has been admitted for teaching mu&s;ic and the pronunciation of foreign languages, in the early and yielding &s;tate of tho&s;e organs, which form the voice and &s;peech. Such is the effect of a moral education, that we often &s;ee its fruits in advanced &s;tages of life, after the religious principles which were connected with it, have been renounced; ju&s;t as we perceive the &s;ame care in a &s;urgeon in his attendance upon patients, after the &s;ympathy which fir&s;t produced this care, has cea&s;|ed to operate upon his mind. The boa&s;ted moral|ity of the Dei&s;ts, is I believe, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, the off|&s;pring of habits, produced originally by the prin|ciples and precepts of Chri&s;tianity. Hence appears the wi&s;dom of Solomon's advice&mdash;<Q>Train up a

<P>THUS have I enumerated the principal cau&s;es, which act mechanically upon morals. If from the combined action of phy&s;ical powers that are oppo|&s;ed to each other, the moral faculty &s;hould become &s;tationary, or if the virtue or vice produced by them, &s;hould form a neutral quality, compo&s;ed of both of them, I hope it will not call in que&s;tion the truth of our general propo&s;itions.

<P>IT might help to enlarge our ideas upon this &s;ubject, to take notice of the influence of the dif|ferent &s;tages of &s;ociety, of agriculture and com|merce, of &s;oil and &s;ituation, of the different degrees of cultivation of ta&s;te, and of the intellectual pow|ers, of the different forms of government, and la&s;t|ly, of the different profe&s;&s;ions and occupations of mankind, upon the moral faculty; but as the&s;e act

indirectly only, and by the intervention of cau&s;es that are unconnected with matter, I conceive they are foreign to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the pre&s;ent enquiry.

<P>THE effects of imitation, habit and a&s;&s;ociation upon morals, would furni&s;h ample matter for inve|&s;tigation. Con&s;idering how much the &s;hape, tex|ture, and conditions of the human body, influence morals, I &s;ubmit it to the con&s;ideration of the in|genious, whether in our endeavours to imitate moral examples, &s;ome advantage may not be deri|ved, from our copying the features and external manners of the originals. What makes the &s;uc|ce&s;s of this experiment probable is, that we gene|rally find men, who&s;e faces re&s;emble each other, have the &s;ame manners and di&s;po&s;itions.

<P>THE influence of ASSOCIATION upon morals, opens an ample field for enquiry. It is from this principle, that we explain the reformation from theft and drunkenne&s;s in &s;ervants which we &s;ome|times &s;ee produced by a draught of &s;pirits in which tartar emetic had been &s;ecretly di&s;&s;olved. The recollection of the pain and &s;ickne&s;s excited by the emetic, naturally a&s;&s;ociates it&s;elf with the &s;pi|rits, &s;o as to render them both equally the objects of aver&s;ion. It is by calling in this principle only, that we can account for the conduct of Mo&s;es, in grinding the golden calf into a powder, and afterwards di&s;&s;olving it (probably by means of hepar &s;ulphuris) in water, and compelling the children of I&s;rael to drink of it, as a puni&s;hment for their idolatry. This mixture is bitter and nau|&s;eating in the highe&s;t degree. An inclination to idolatry, therefore, could not be felt without be|ing a&s;&s;ociated with the remembrance of this di&s;a|greeable mixture, and of cour&s;e being rejected, with equal abhorrence. The benefit of corporal puni&s;hments, when they are of a &s;hort duration, depends in part up their being connected by time and place, with the crimes for which they are in|flicted. Quick as the thunder follows the light|ning,
<PB N="43" REF="026112_0049_0FCF4971E98B1220">
if it were po&s;&s;ible, &s;hould puni&s;hments fol|low the crimes, and the advantage of a&s;&s;ociation would be more certain, if the &s;pot where they were committed, were made the theatre of their expiation. It is from the effects of this a&s;&s;ociation, probably, that the change of place and company produced by exile and tran&s;portation, has &s;o often reclaimed bad men, after moral&mdash;rational&mdash;and phy&s;ical means of reformation had been u&s;ed to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>AS SENSIBILITY is the avenue to the moral fa|culty, every thing which tends to dimini&s;h it tends al&s;o to injure morals.&mdash;The Romans owed much of their corruption to the &s;ights of the conte&s;ts of their gladiators, and of criminals, with wild bea&s;ts. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, executions &s;hould never be pub|lic. Indeed, I believe there are no public puni&s;h|ments of any kind, that do not harden the hearts of &s;pectators, and thereby le&s;&s;en the natural horror which all crimes at fir&s;t excite in the human mind.</P>
<P>CRUELTY to brute animals is another means of de&s;troying moral &s;en&s;ibility. The ferocity of &s;a|vages has been a&s;cribed in part to their peculiar mode of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Mr. Hogarth points out in his ingenious prints, the connection between cru|elty to brute animals in youth, and murder in man|hood.

The Emperor Domitian prepared his mind by the amu&s;ement of killing flies, for all tho&s;e bloody crimes which afterwards di&s;graced his reign.

<P>IN order to pre&s;erve the vigor of the moral fa|culty, it is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to keep young people as ignorant as po&s;&s;ible of tho&s;e crimes, that are generally thought mo&s;t di&s;graceful to human na|ture.

Soon afterwards, they become what is called &s;edative; that is, they di|mini&s;h the action of the vital powers, and thereby produce languor and weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE effects of &s;pirituous liquors upon the hu|man body, are &s;ometimes &s;low in their appearance. A &s;trong con&s;titution, e&s;pecially if it be a&s;&s;i&s;ted with con&s;tant and hard labour, will counteract the de&s;tructive effects of &s;pirits for many years, but in general they produce the following di&s;ea&s;es:</P>
<P>1. <HI>A &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;tomach,</HI> and <HI>vomiting</HI> in the morning. This di&s;order is generally accompanied by a want of appetite for breakfa&s;t. It is known by tremors in the hands, in&s;omuch that per&s;ons who labour under it, are hardly able to lift a tea cup to their heads, till they have taken a do&s;e of &s;ome cordial liquor.

<P>BUT the effects of ardent &s;pirits upon the hu|man body, do not end in the de&s;truction of life. They derange and even deform a <HI>dead</HI> body &s;o as to render it a loath&s;ome addition to the clay which conceals it from human view after death. This has been frequently demon&s;trated in the di&s;&s;ection of per&s;ons who have been de&s;troyed by the u&s;e of ardent &s;pirits. They harden and contract the fi|bres of the &s;tomach and bowels, or induce in them ab&s;ce&s;&s;es and gangrene&mdash;they produce &s;chirri in the vi&s;cera&mdash;they contract the diameter of the &s;an|guiferous and bronchial ve&s;&s;els&mdash;they induce o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">|fications in the tendons, arteries, and pleura, and la&s;tly&mdash;they produce a peculiar cri&s;pne&s;s in the hair of the head, in&s;omuch that the wig-makers in London give much le&s;s for it, than for the hair of &s;ober people.</P>

I appeal to the ob&s;ervations of my countrymen, whether &s;uch &s;cenes of wretchedne&s;s do not follow the tracks of &s;pirituous liquors, in every part of the United States.</P>
<P>THUS have I in a few words pointed out the ef|fects of &s;pirituous liquors upon the bodies, minds, and e&s;tates of my fellow-citizens.&mdash;Their mi&s;chiefs may be &s;ummed up in a few Words. They fill our church-yards with premature graves, they deface the image of God in the &s;oul, they de|range or de&s;troy the intellectual powers, they fill the &s;heriff's docket with executions, they croud our ho&s;pitals with patients, and our jails with cri|minals, they lead to places of public ignomy and puni&s;hment, and la&s;tly, they people the regions&mdash; but it belongs to another profe&s;&s;ion to &s;hew their terrible con&s;equences in the future world.</P>
<P>AFTER this melancholy detail of the pernicious ef|fects of &s;pirituous liquors upon the body, it may not be
<PB N="66" REF="026112_0071_0FCFF4EFCA376AE0">
improper to enumerate the u&s;ual cau&s;es which lead to their intemperate u&s;e. They are, 1. Expo&s;ure to exce&s;&s;ive heat and cold. 2. Hard labour, di&s;|proportioned to the &s;trength of the body. 3. Hunger, more e&s;pecially tho&s;e degrees of it which have been excited by long intervals between meals. 4. Long &s;peaking, or long &s;ittings in company. 5. Smoking and chewing tobacco. 6. Taking me|dicines in ardent &s;pirits. 7. Breeding &s;ickne&s;s. 8. Great dome&s;tic care. I have of ob&s;erved this cau&s;e to produce it, in &s;everal in&s;tances in women. 9. Dome&s;tic vexations, more e&s;pecially conjugal infelicity. 10. The infection of company that is addicted to &s;trong drink. 11. Debt. 12. The corrodings of a guilty con&s;cience; and, 13. Soli|tude where the mind does not po&s;&s;e&s;s re&s;ources in it&s;elf, in books, or religion. It is remarkable that an intemperate u&s;e of ardent spirits is &s;eldom pro|duced by that grief which follows the death of relations or friends.</P>
<P>IN the u&s;e of &s;pirits, there are certain progre&s;|&s;ive &s;tages which de&s;erve to be mentioned. Men begin generally by drinking them in a diluted &s;tate, at dinner only. They next drink them in the &s;ame &s;tate in the afternoon and evening. In the cour&s;e of a few years, they call for them in the forenoon, and &s;oon afterwards before breakfa&s;t, encrea&s;ing their &s;trength from time to time until they finally
<PB N="67" REF="026112_0072_0FCFF4F333D535F8">
drink them in a undiluted &s;tate during every hour of the night. I have known &s;everal per&s;ons who have pa&s;&s;ed through all the above &s;tages of intem|perance, in whom the pul&s;e of life &s;eemed to be &s;upported for &s;everal months before their death, only by drinking from one to two quarts of raw &s;pirits every night.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to combat &s;ome prejudices in favour of the u&s;e of &s;prituous liquors.</P>
<P>THE <HI>three</HI> occa&s;ions in which &s;pirits have been thought mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful are the follow|ing:</P>
<P N="1">1. IN very cold weather.</P>
<P N="2">2. IN very warm weather. And,</P>
<P N="3">3. IN times of hard labour.</P>
<P N="1">1. THERE cannot be a greater error than to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;pirituous liquors le&s;&s;en the effects of cold upon the body. On the contrary, I main|tain that they always render the body more liable to be affected and injured by cold. The tem|porary warmth they produce, is always &s;ucceeded by chilline&s;s. If any thing, be&s;ides warm cloath|ing and exerci&s;e, be nece&s;&s;ary to warm the body in cold weather, a plentiful meal of whol&s;ome food is
<PB N="68" REF="026112_0073_0FCFF4F44BDDCBC8">
at all times &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e. This, by &s;timulating the &s;tomach, invigorates the whole &s;y&s;tem, and thus renders it le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of the cold.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT is equally ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;pirituous liquors le&s;&s;en the effects of heat upon the body. So far from it, they rather encrea&s;e them. They add an internal heat to the external heat of the &s;un; they di&s;po&s;e to fevers and inflammations of the mo&s;t dangerous kind; they produce preterna|tural &s;weats which weaken, in&s;tead of an uniform and gentle per&s;piration, which exhilarates the bo|dy. Half the di&s;ea&s;es which are &s;aid to be produ|ced by warm weather, I am per&s;uaded are produ|ced by the &s;pirits which are &s;wallowed to le&s;&s;en its effects upon the &s;y&s;tem.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"I aver from my own knowledge and cu&s;tom (&s;ays Dr. Mo&s;ely<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Di&s;ea&s;es of tropical climates.</NOTE>) as well as the cu&s;tom and ob&s;ervations of many other people, that tho&s;e who drink nothing but <HI>water,</HI> or make it their principal drink, are but little affected by the climate, and can undergo the greate&s;t fatigue without inconvenience. Tho&s;e who u&s;e water for their common drink will never be &s;ubject to trouble&s;ome or dangerous di&s;|ea&s;es, and the only inconvenience attending water drink|ers is, that their appetite is &s;o keen that they eat more than they ought."</P><P>"Rum (&s;ays Dr. Bell<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Inquiry into the cau&s;es which produce, and the means of preventing di&s;ea&s;es among Briti&s;h officers, &s;oldiers, and others in the We&s;t-Indies.</NOTE>) whether u&s;ed habitually, mode|rately, or in exce&s;&s;ive quantities, in the We&s;t-Indies, al|ways dimini&s;hes the &s;trength of the body, and therefore renders the men more &s;u&s;ceptible of di&s;ea&s;e, and unfit for any &s;ervice in which vigor or activity are required.'</P></NOTE></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="69" REF="026112_0074_0FCFF4F84532AC58">3. I maintain with equal confidence, that &s;piritu|ous liquors do not le&s;&s;en the effects of hard labour upon the body. Look at the hor&s;e, with every mu&s;cle of his body &s;welled from morning till night in the plough, or the team, does he make &s;igns for &s;pirits to enable him to cleave the earth, or to climb a hill?&mdash;No. He requires nothing but cool water and &s;ub&s;tantial food. There is nei|ther &s;trength nor nouri&s;hment in &s;pirituous liquors. If they produce vigour in labour, it is of a tran&s;i|ent nature, and is always &s;ucceeded by a &s;en&s;e of weakne&s;s and fatigue. The&s;e facts are founded in ob&s;ervation; for I have repeatedly &s;een tho&s;e men perform the greate&s;t exploits in work both as to their degrees and duration, who never ta&s;ted &s;pirituous liquors.</P>
<P>BUT are there no conditions of the human bo|dy in which &s;pirituous liquors are required? Yes,
<PB N="70" REF="026112_0075_0FCFF4FAAAB5CAC8">
there are; 1&s;t. In tho&s;e ca&s;es where the body has been exhau&s;ted by any cau&s;es, and faintne&s;s, or a &s;toppage in the circulation of the blood has been produced, the &s;udden &s;timulus of &s;pirits may be nece&s;&s;ary. In this ca&s;e we comply &s;trictly with the advice of Solomon, who confines the u&s;e of "&s;trong drink," only to him "that is ready to pe|ri&s;h!" and 2dly. When the body has been long expo&s;ed to wet weather, and more e&s;pecially if cold be joined with it, a moderate quantity of &s;pirits is not only proper but highly u&s;eful to obviate debi|lity, and thus to prevent a fever. I take the&s;e to be the only two ca&s;es that can occur, in which &s;pi|rituous liquors are innocent or nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>BUT if we reject &s;pirits from being part of our drinks, what liquors &s;hall we &s;ub&s;titute in the room of them? For cu&s;tom, the experience of all ages and countries, and even nature her&s;elf, all &s;eem to demand drinks more grateful and more cordial than &s;imple water.</P>
<P>TO this I &s;hall reply, by recommending in the room of &s;pirits, in the fir&s;t place,</P>
<P N="1">1. CYDER. This excellent liquor contains a &s;mall quantity of &s;pirit, but &s;o diluted and blunted, by being combined with an acid and a large quan|tity of &s;acharine matter and water, as to be per|fectly
<PB N="71" REF="026112_0076_0FCFF4FBDBF16588">
inoffen&s;ive and whole&s;ome. It di&s;agrees on|ly with per&s;ons &s;ubject to the rheumati&s;m, but it may be rendered inoffen&s;ive to &s;uch people by ex|tingui&s;hing a red hot iron in it, or by diluting it with water. It is to be lamented that the late fro&s;ts in the &s;pring often deprive us of the fruit which affords this liquor. But the effects of the&s;e fro&s;ts have been in &s;ome mea&s;ure obviated, by giving an orchard a north-we&s;t expo&s;ure, &s;o as to check too early vegetation, and by kindling two or three large fires of bru&s;h and &s;traw to the windward of the orchard, the evening before we expect a night of fro&s;t. This la&s;t expedient, has in many in&s;tan|ces within the compa&s;s of my knowledge, pre&s;erv|ed the fruit of an orchard, to the great joy and emolument of the ingenious hu&s;bandman.</P>
<P N="2">2. BEER is a whol&s;ome liquor compared with &s;pirits. The grain from which it is obtained is not liable like the apple, to be affected by fro&s;t, and therefore it can always be procured at a moderate expen&s;e. It abounds with nouri&s;hment&mdash;hence we find many of the common people in Great Bri|tain, endure hard labour with no other food than a quart or three pints of this liquor, with a few pounds of bread a-day.</P>
<P N="3">3. WINE is likewi&s;e a whole&s;ome liquor, com|pared with &s;pirits. The low wines of France, I
<PB N="72" REF="026112_0077_0FCF49799576E368">
believe, could be drank at a le&s;s expence than &s;pirits, in this country. The pea&s;ants in France, who drink the&s;e liquors in large quantities, are a healthy and &s;ober body of people. Wines of all kinds yield, by chemical analy&s;is, the &s;ame principles as cyder, but in different proportions; hence they are both cordial and nouri&s;hing. It has been remarked, that few men ever become <HI>habitual</HI> drunkards up|on wine. It derives its reli&s;h principally from company, and is &s;eldom, like &s;pirituous liquors, drank in a chimney corner, or in a clo&s;et. The effects of wine upon the <HI>temper</HI> are likewi&s;e in mo&s;t ca&s;es, directly oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e that were men|tioned of &s;pirituous liquors. It mu&s;t be a bad heart, indeed, that is not rendered more chearful and more generous, by a few gla&s;&s;es of wine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If two barrels of cyder fre&s;h from the pre&s;s, are boiled into one, and afterwards fermented, and kept for two or three years in a dry cellar, it affords a liquor which (accord|ing to the quality of the apple from which the cyder is made) has the ta&s;te of Malaga or Rheni&s;h wine. This liquor, when mixed with water, affords a very agreeable drink in &s;ummer. I have taken the liberty to call it <HI>Fomona wine.</HI> Another me|thod of obtaining a plea&s;ant wine from the apple, is to add to four and twenty gallons of new cyder, three gallons of a &s;yrup made from the expre&s;&s;ed juice of &s;weet apples. When thoroughly fermented, and kept for &s;ome time, it becomes fit for u&s;e.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="4">4. MELASSES and WATER compo&s;e an|other
<PB N="73" REF="026112_0078_0FCFF4FEB98D0070">
other excellent &s;ub&s;titute for &s;pirits. It is both cordial and nouri&s;hing.</P>
<P N="5">5. The SUGAR MAPLE tree affords a thin JUICE in &s;ummer, which is cooling and refre&s;hing. It has long been u&s;ed in Connecticut, for this pur|po&s;e in the time of harve&s;t. The &s;ettlers in the we&s;tern counties of Penn&s;ylvania and New-York, will do well to &s;uffer a few of the trees which yield this plea&s;ant juice, to remain in all their fields. They may prove the means, not only of &s;aving their children and grand-children many hundred pounds, but of &s;aving their bodies from di&s;ea&s;e and death, and their &s;ouls from mi&s;ery beyond the grave.</P>
<P N="6">6. VINEGAR and WATER &s;weetened with &s;ugar or mela&s;&s;es, is an agreeable drink in warm weather. I beg leave to recommend this whole|&s;ome liquor to reapers in a particular manner. It is plea&s;ant and cooling. It promotes per&s;piration, and re&s;i&s;ts putrefaction. Vinegar and water con|&s;tituted the only drink of the &s;oldiers of the Ro|man republic; and it is well known that they marched and fought in a warm climate, and be|neath a load of arms that weighed 60lbs. Boaz, a wealthy farmer in Pale&s;tine, we find, treated his reapers with nothing but bread dipped in vinegar.
<PB N="74" REF="026112_0079_0FCFF50489CCED28">
Under this head, I &s;hould not neglect to recom|mend BUTTER MILK and WATER, or SOUR MILK (commonly called bonneclabber) and WATER. It will be rendered more grateful by the addition of a little &s;ugar. PUNCH is likewi&s;e calculated to le&s;&s;en the effects of heat, and hard labour upon the body. The &s;pirit in this liquor is blunted by its union with the vegetable acid. Hence it po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es, not only the con&s;tituent parts, but mo&s;t of the qualities of cyder and wine. To render this liquor perfectly innocent and whole&s;ome, it mu&s;t be drank <HI>weak,</HI> in <HI>moderate</HI> quantities, and <HI>only</HI> in warm weather. Say not, that &s;pirits have become nece&s;&s;ary in harve&s;t, from habit and the cu&s;tom of the country. The cu&s;tom of &s;wallowing this li|quid fire, is a bad one, and the habit of it may be broken. Let half a dozen farmers in a neigh|bourhood, combine to allow higher wages to their reapers than are common, and a &s;ufficient quantity of <HI>any</HI> of the liquors I have recommended, and they may &s;oon aboli&s;h the practice of giving them &s;pirits. They will in a little while be delighted with the good effects of their a&s;&s;ociation. Their grain will be &s;ooner and more carefully gathered into their barns, and an hundred di&s;agreeable &s;cenes of &s;ickne&s;s and contention will be avoided, which always follow in a greater or le&s;s degree the u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="026112_0080_0FCFF50A264CFA38">TO enable the body to &s;upport the wa&s;te of its &s;trength by labour, the &s;tomach &s;hould be <HI>con&s;tant|ly,</HI> but <HI>moderately,</HI> &s;timulated by aliment of a par|ticular kind. Labourers bear with great difficulty long intervals between their meals. They &s;hould always eat four or five times a-day in time of har|ve&s;t, or at other &s;ea&s;ons of great bodily exertion. The food at the&s;e times &s;hould be <HI>&s;olid,</HI> con&s;i&s;t|ing chiefly of &s;alted meat. The vegetables u&s;ed with it &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome activity. Onions and garlic are of a mo&s;t cordial nature. The&s;e vege|tables compo&s;ed part of the diet which enabled the I&s;raelites to endure, in a warm climate, the heavy ta&s;ks impo&s;ed upon them by their Egyptian ma&s;ters. They were likewi&s;e eaten by the Roman farmers to repair the wa&s;te of their &s;trength by the toils of harve&s;t. But further; There are certain SWEET SUBSTANCES which &s;upport the body in labour. The negroes in the We&s;t Indies grow fat and &s;trong by drinking the juice of the &s;ugar cane in the &s;ea|&s;on of grinding it. The Jewi&s;h &s;oldiers were invi|gorated by occa&s;ionally eating rai&s;ins and figs. A bread compo&s;ed of wheat flour, mela&s;&s;es, and gin|ger, (compo&s;ing what is called ginger bread), and taken in &s;mall quantities, during the day, is hap|pily calculated to obviate the debility which is &s;o apt to be brought on by labour. All the&s;e &s;ub|&s;tances, whether of an animal or vegetable nature,
<PB N="76" REF="026112_0081_0FCFF50C423892B0">
which have been mentioned, &s;hould be u&s;ed by la|bouring people. They le&s;&s;en the nece&s;&s;ity for cordial drinks, and they impart <HI>equal</HI> and <HI>durable</HI> &s;trength to every part of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>THERE are certain cla&s;&s;es of people to whom I beg leave to &s;ugge&s;t a caution or two upon the u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors.</P>
<P N="1">1. VALETUDINARIANS, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who la|bour under di&s;orders of the &s;tomach and bowels, are very apt to fly to &s;pirits for relief. Let &s;uch people be cautious how they repeat this dangerous re|medy. I have known many men and women, of excellent characters and principles, who have been betrayed by occa&s;ional do&s;es of gin or brandy to ea&s;e the cholic, into a love of &s;pirituous liquors, in&s;omuch that they have afterwards fallen &s;acri|fices to their fatal effects. The different prepara|tions of opium are a thou&s;and times more &s;afe and innocent than &s;pirituous liquors, in all &s;pa&s;modic affections of the &s;tomach and bowels. So appre|hen&s;ive am I of the danger of contracting a love for &s;pirituous liquors, by accu&s;toming the &s;tomach to their &s;timules, that I think the fewer medicines we exhibit in &s;pirituous vehicles the better.</P>
<P N="2">2. SOME people, from living in countries &s;ub|ject to the intermitting fever, endeavour to fortify
<PB N="77" REF="026112_0082_0FCF49806E7B75B8">
them&s;elves again&s;t it by two or three gla&s;&s;es of bit|ters made with &s;pirits every day. There is great danger of men becoming &s;ots from this practice. Be&s;ides, this mode of preventing intermittents is by no means a certain one. A much better &s;ecu|rity again&s;t them is to be found in the Je&s;uits bark. A tea-&s;poonful of this excellent medicine taken every morning during the &s;ickly &s;ea&s;on, has in many in&s;tances pre&s;erved whole families, in the neighbourhood of rivers and mill-ponds, from fe|vers of all kinds. If Je&s;uits bark cannot be had, a gill or half a pint of a &s;trong infu&s;ion of centaury, camomile, wormwood, or rue, in <HI>water,</HI> with a little calamus mixed with it, may be taken with nearly the &s;ame advantage as the bark, every morning. Tho&s;e who live in a &s;ickly pan of the country, and cannot procure the bark, or any of the bitters which have been mentioned, I would advi&s;e to a|void the morning and evening air in the &s;ickly months&mdash;to kindle fires in their hou&s;es on damp days, and in cool evenings throughout the whole &s;ummer, and to put on woollen clothing about the fir&s;t week in September. The la&s;t part of the&s;e di|rections applies only to the inhabitants of the middle &s;tates. The&s;e cautions, I am per&s;uaded, will be more effectual in preventing autumnal fe|vers than the be&s;t preparations that can be made from bitters in &s;pirits.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="78" REF="026112_0083_0FCFF50E177E2130">3. MEN, who follow profe&s;&s;ions that require a con&s;tant exerci&s;e of the mind or body, or perhaps both, are very apt to &s;eek relief from fatigue in &s;pirituous liquors. To &s;uch per&s;ons I would beg leave to recommend the u&s;e of TEA in&s;tead of &s;pi|rits. This gentle &s;timulus, by re&s;toring excite|ment, removes fatigue, and invigorates the whole &s;y&s;tem. I am no advocate for the general or ex|ce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of tea. When drank too &s;trong, it is hurtful, e&s;pecially to the female con&s;titution; but when drank of a moderate degree of &s;trength, and in moderate quantities, with &s;ugar and cream, or milk, I believe it is in general innocent, and at all times to be preferred to &s;pirituous liquors. An|thony Benezet, one of the mo&s;t indu&s;trious &s;chool-ma&s;ters I ever knew, told me that he had been pre&s;erved from the love of &s;pirituous liquors by contracting a love for tea in early life. Three or four di&s;hes taken in an afternoon, carried off the fatigue of a whole day's labour in his &s;chool.

<P><PB N="79" REF="026112_0084_0FCFF50FD0EAA0A0">TO every cla&s;s of my readers, I beg leave to &s;ug|ge&s;t a caution again&s;t the u&s;e of TODDY. I acknow|ledge that I have known &s;ome men, who, by limit|ing its &s;trength con&s;tantly by mea&s;uring the &s;pirit and water, and who by drinking it <HI>only</HI> at their <HI>meals,</HI> have drunken toddy for many years without &s;uffering in any degree from it: but I have known many more who have been in&s;en&s;ibly led from drinking toddy for their con&s;tant drink, to take drams in the morning, and have afterwards paid their lives as the price of their folly. I &s;hall &s;elect one ca&s;e from among many, to &s;hew the or|dinary progre&s;s of intemperance in the u&s;e of &s;pi|rituous liquors.&mdash;A gentleman, once of a fair and &s;ober character, in the city of Philadelphia, for many years drank toddy as his con&s;tant drink. From this he proceeded to drink grog. After a while nothing would &s;atisfy him but &s;lings made of equal parts of rum and water, with a little &s;ugar. From &s;lings he advanced to raw rum&mdash;and from

common rum to Jamaica &s;pirits. Here he re&s;ted for a few months; but at la&s;t, he found even Ja|maica &s;pirits were not &s;trong enough to warm his &s;tomach, and he made it a con&s;tant practice to throw a table &s;poonful of ground pepper into each gla&s;s of his &s;pirits, in order (to u&s;e his own ex|pre&s;&s;ion) "to take of their coldne&s;s." It is hard|ly nece&s;&s;ary to add, that he &s;oon afterwards died a martyr to his own intemperance.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude what has been &s;aid of the ef|fects of &s;pirituous liquors with two ob&s;ervations&mdash; 1. A people corrupted by &s;trong drink cannot long be a <HI>free</HI> people. The rulers of &s;uch a com|munity will &s;oon partake of the vices of that ma&s;s from which they were &s;ecreted, and all our laws and governments will &s;ooner or later bear the &s;ame marks of the effects of &s;pirituous liquors which were de&s;cribed formerly upon individuals. I &s;ubmit it therefore to the con&s;ideration of our rulers, whether more laws &s;hould not be made to increa&s;e the expen&s;e and le&s;&s;en the con&s;umption of &s;pirituous liquors, and whether &s;ome mark of pub|lic infamy &s;hould not be inflicted by law upon every man, convicted before a common magi&s;trate of drunkenne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd and la&s;t ob&s;ervation I &s;hall offer, is of a
<PB N="81" REF="026112_0086_0FCFF5145C60F420">
&s;erious nature. It has been remarked, that the Indians have dimini&s;hed every where in America &s;ince their connections with the Europeans. This has been ju&s;tly a&s;cribed to the Europeans having introduced &s;pirituous liquors among them. Let tho&s;e men, who are every day turning their backs upon all the benefits of cultivated &s;ociety, to &s;eek habitations in the neighbourhood of Indians, con&s;ider how far this wandering mode of life is produced by the &s;ame cau&s;e which has &s;cattered and annihilated &s;o many Indian tribes. Long life, and the &s;ecure po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of property, in the land of their ance&s;tors, were looked upon as ble&s;&s;ings among the ancient Jews. For a &s;on to mingle his du&s;t with the du&s;t of his father, was to act worthy of his inheritance; and the pro&s;pect of this ho|nour often afforded a con&s;olation even in death. However exalted, my countrymen, your ideas of liberty may be, while you expo&s;e your&s;elves by the u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors to this con&s;equence of them, you are nothing more than the pioneers, or in more &s;lavi&s;h terms, "the hewers of wood" of your more indu&s;trious neighbours.</P>
<P>IF the facts that have been &s;tated, have produced in any of my readers, who have &s;uffered from the u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors, a re&s;olution to ab&s;tain from them hereafter, I mu&s;t beg leave to inform

them, that they mu&s;t leave them off <HI>&s;uddenly</HI> and <HI>entirely.</HI> No man was ever <HI>gradually</HI> reformed from drinking &s;pirits. He mu&s;t not only avoid ta&s;ting, but even &s;melling them, until long habits of ab&s;tinence have &s;ubdued his affection for them.

<HEAD>INQUIRY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN an E&s;&s;ay, entitled "Thoughts on the Pulmo|nary Con&s;umption,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Medical Inquiries and Ob&s;ervations.</NOTE> I attempted to &s;hew that this di&s;order was the effect of cau&s;es which indu|ced general debility, and that the only hope of di&s;covering a cure for it &s;hould be directed to &s;uch remedies as act upon the whole &s;y&s;tem. In the following inquiry, I &s;hall endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h the truth of each of tho&s;e opinions, by a detail of facts and rea&s;onings, at which I only hinted in my former e&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="026112_0090_0FCFF52208AF9A30">THE method I have cho&s;en for this purpo&s;e, is to deliver, and afterwards to &s;upport, a few gene|ral propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin by remarking,</P>
<P N="1">I. THAT the Pulmonary Con&s;umption is a di&s;ea&s;e of debility.</P>
<P>THIS I infer, 1&s;t, From the remote and ex|citing cau&s;es which produce it. The remote cau&s;es are pneumony, catarrh, haemopty&s;is, rheumati&s;m, gout, a&s;thma, &s;crophula, nervous and intermitting fevers, mea&s;les, repelled humors from the &s;urface of the body, the venereal di&s;ea&s;e, ob&s;tructed men|&s;es, &s;udden growth about the age of puberty, grief, and all other debilitating pa&s;&s;ions of the mind; hypochondria&s;is, improper lactation, exce&s;&s;ive eva|cuation of all kinds, more e&s;pecially by &s;tool<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir George Baker relates in the &s;econd volume of the Medical Tran&s;actions, that Dr. Blanchard had informed him that he had &s;een the con&s;umption brought on ten per|&s;ons out of ninety, by exce&s;&s;ive purging u&s;ed to prepare the body for the &s;mall-pox. I have &s;een a ca&s;e of con&s;umption in a youth of 17, from the &s;pitting produced by the intempe|rate u&s;e of &s;egars.</NOTE>, cold and damp air, external violence acting upon
<PB N="87" REF="026112_0091_0FCFF5234F48CFB0">
the body; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Lind &s;ays that out of 360 patients whom he attended between July 1&s;t, 1758, and July 1&s;t, 1760, in con&s;umptions, the di&s;order was brought on <HI>one fourth</HI> of them, by falls, brui&s;es, and &s;trains received a year or two before the di&s;ea&s;e made its appearance.</NOTE> and finally every thing that tends directly or indirectly to impair the vigor of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t frequent exciting cau&s;e of con&s;ump|tion is the alternate application of heat and cold to the whole external &s;urface of the body, but all the remote cau&s;es which have been enumerated, ope|rate as exciting cau&s;es of con&s;umption when they act on previous debility. Original injuries of the lungs &s;eldom induce this di&s;order except they fir&s;t induce a debility of the whole &s;y&s;tem by a trou|ble&s;ome and ob&s;tinate cough.</P>
<P N="2">2. FROM the occupations and habits of per&s;ons who are mo&s;t liable to this di&s;order. The&s;e are &s;tudious men, and mechanics who lead &s;edentary lives in confined places; al&s;o women, and all per|&s;ons of irritable habits, whether of body or mind.</P>
<P N="3">3. FROM the period in which per&s;ons are mo&s;t liable to be affected by this di&s;order. This is ge|nerally
<PB N="88" REF="026112_0092_0FCFF524E87A78F8">
between the 18th and 36th year of life, a period in which the &s;y&s;tem is liable in a peculiar manner to mo&s;t di&s;ea&s;es which induce the di&s;order, and in which indirect debility is oftener produced than in any other &s;tage of life, by the exce&s;&s;ive ex|erci&s;es of the body and mind in the pur&s;uits of bu|&s;ine&s;s or plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I have conformed to authors, in fixing the pe|riod of con&s;umptions between the 18th and 36th year of life&mdash;but it is well known that it &s;ometimes appears in children, and frequently in per&s;ons be|yond the 40th, or even 50th year of life.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE pulmonary con&s;umption is a primary di&s;ea&s;e of the <HI>whole</HI> &s;y&s;tem. This I infer,</P>
<P N="1">1. FROM the cau&s;es which produce it, acting upon the whole &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P N="2">2. FROM the &s;ymptoms of general debility which always precede the affection of the lungs. The&s;e &s;ymptoms are a quick pul&s;e, e&s;pecially to|wards evening; a heat and burning in the palms of the hands; faintne&s;s, head-ach, &s;ickne&s;s at &s;to|mach, and an occa&s;ional diarrhoea. I have fre|quently ob&s;erved each of the&s;e &s;ymptoms for &s;e|veral months before I have heard of a &s;ingle com|plaint in the brea&s;t.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="89" REF="026112_0093_0FCFF52F771E7170">3. FROM the pulmonary con&s;umption alterna|ting with other di&s;ea&s;es which obviou&s;ly belong to the whole &s;y&s;tem. I &s;hall briefly mention the&s;e di&s;|ea&s;es.</P>
<P>THE RHEUMATISM. I have &s;een many ca&s;es in which this di&s;ea&s;e and the con&s;umption have al|ternately, in different &s;ea&s;ons or years, affected the &s;y&s;tem. In the winter of 1792, three clinical patients in the Penn&s;ylvania ho&s;pital exemplified by their complaints the truth of this ob&s;ervation. They were relieved &s;everal times of a cough by pains in their limbs, and as often, the pains in their limbs &s;eemed for a while to promi&s;e a cure to their pulmonic complaints.</P>
<P>THE GOUT has often been ob&s;erved to alternate with the pulmonary con&s;umption, e&s;pecially in per|&s;ons in the decline of life. Dr. Sydenham de&s;cribes a &s;hort cough continuing through the whole win|ter, as a &s;ymptom of gouty habits. A gentleman from Virginia died under my care in the &s;pring of 1788, in the 45th year of his age, with all the &s;ymptoms of pulmonary con&s;umption, which had frequently alternated with pains and a &s;welling in his feet.</P>
<P>THE pulmonary con&s;umption has been ob&s;erved to alternate with MADNESS. Of this I have &s;een
<PB N="90" REF="026112_0094_0FCFF53222B2BC78">
two in&s;tances, in both of which, the cough, and expectoration were wholly &s;u&s;pended during the continuance of the derangement of the mind. Dr. Mead mentions a melancholy ca&s;e of the &s;ame kind in a young lady; and &s;imilar ca&s;es are to be met with in other authors. In all of them the di&s;ea&s;e proved fatal. In one of the ca&s;es which came un|der my notice, the &s;ymptoms of con&s;umption re|turned before the death of the patient.</P>
<P>I have likewi&s;e witne&s;&s;ed two ca&s;es in which the return of rea&s;on after madne&s;s, was &s;uddenly &s;uc|ceeded by a fatal pulmonary con&s;umption. Per|haps the fal&s;e hopes, and even the cheerfulne&s;s which &s;o univer&s;ally occur in this di&s;order, may be re&s;olved into a morbid &s;tate of the mind, produced by a general derangement of the whole &s;y&s;tem. So univer&s;al are the delu&s;ion and hopes of patients with re&s;pect to the nature and i&s;&s;ue of this di&s;order, that I have never met with but one man, who, up|on being a&s;ked what was the matter with him, an|&s;wered unequivocally, "that he was in a con&s;ump|tion!"</P>
<P>AGAIN&mdash;Dr. Bennet mentions a ca&s;e of "A phthi&s;ical patient who was &s;eized with a violent PAIN IN THE TEETH for two days, and in whom, during that time, every &s;ymptom of a con&s;umption, except the leanne&s;s of the body, altogether van|i&s;hed;"
<PB N="91" REF="026112_0095_0FCFF533DBA6F6D8">
and he adds further, "that a de&s;luxion on the lungs had often been relieved by SALIVA|RY EVACUATIONS."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Treati&s;e of the Nature and Cure of Con&s;umptions&mdash; Exercitation X.</NOTE></P>
<P>I have &s;een &s;everal in&s;tances in which the pul|monary &s;ymptoms have alternated with HEAD|ACH and DYSPEPSIA,&mdash;al&s;o with pain and noi&s;e in one of the EARS. This affection of the ears &s;ometimes continues throughout the whole di&s;ea&s;e without any remi&s;&s;ion of the pulmonary &s;ymptoms. I have &s;een one ca&s;e of a di&s;charge of matter from the left ear without being accompani|ed by either pain or noi&s;e.</P>
<P>IN all our books of medicine are to be found ca&s;es of con&s;umption alternating with ERUPTIONS ON THE SKIN.</P>
<P>AND who has not &s;een the pulmonary &s;ymptoms alternately relieved, and reproduced by the ap|pearance or ce&s;&s;ation of a diarrhoea, or pains in the BOWELS?</P>
<P>TO the&s;e facts I &s;hall only add, under this head, as a proof of the con&s;umption being a di&s;|ea&s;e of the whole &s;y&s;tem, that it is always more or
<PB N="92" REF="026112_0096_0FCFF33B10331C28">
le&s;s relieved by the change which is induced in the &s;y&s;tem by pregnancy.</P>
<P N="4">4. I infer that the pulmonary con&s;umption is a di&s;ea&s;e of the whole &s;y&s;tem from its analogy with &s;everal other di&s;ea&s;es which, though accompanied by local affections, are obviou&s;ly produced by a morbid &s;tate of the whole &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>THE Rheumati&s;m, the Gout, the Mea&s;les, Small-pox, the different &s;pecies of Cynanche&mdash;all furni&s;h examples of the connection of local affec|tions with a general di&s;ea&s;e; but the APOPLEXY, and the PNEUMONY furni&s;h the mo&s;t &s;triking analogies of local affection, &s;ucceeding a general di&s;order of the &s;y&s;tem in the pulmonary con&s;ump|tion.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t frequent cau&s;e of apoplexy is a ge|neral debility of the &s;y&s;tem, produced by intempe|rance in eating and drinking. The phaenomena of the di&s;ea&s;e are produced by an effu&s;ion of blood or &s;erum, in con&s;equence of a morbid di&s;ten&s;ion, or of a rupture of the ve&s;&s;els of the brain. The pul|monary con&s;umption begins and ends in the &s;ame way, allowing only for the difference of &s;ituation and &s;tructure of the brain and lungs. After the production of predi&s;po&s;ing debility from the action of the remote cau&s;es formerly enumerated, the fluids are determined to the weake&s;t part of the
<PB N="93" REF="026112_0097_0FCFF33EC38BFD50">
body. Hence effu&s;ions of &s;erum or blood take place in the lungs. When &s;erum is effu&s;ed, a pi|tuitous or purulent expectoration alone takes place; &mdash;when blood is di&s;charged, a di&s;ea&s;e is produced which has been called Haemopty&s;is. An effu&s;ion of blood in the brain, brought on by the operation of general debility, has been called by Dr. Hoff|man, with equal propriety, a haermorrhage of the brain. The effu&s;ion of blood in the lungs in con|&s;equence of the rupture of a blood ve&s;&s;el is le&s;s fatal than the &s;ame accident when it occurs in the brain, only becau&s;e the blood in the former ca&s;e is more ea&s;ily di&s;charged from the &s;y&s;tem. Where no rupture of a blood ve&s;&s;el is produced, death is nearly as &s;peedy and certain in the one ca&s;e as in the other.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have &s;een two ca&s;es of &s;udden death from Hemopty&s;is. In one of them there was very little blood di&s;charged through the mouth.</NOTE> Di&s;&s;ections &s;how many ca&s;es of &s;uffocation and and death, from the lungs being preternaturally fill|ed with blood or &s;erum. From this great analo|gy between the remote and proximate cau&s;es of the two di&s;ea&s;es which have been de&s;cribed, I have taken the liberty to call them both by the name of apoplexy. The only &s;ymptom which does not accord with the derivation of the term, is, that in the apoplexy of the lungs, the patient does not fall
<PB N="94" REF="026112_0098_0FCFF34273F711F0">
down as if by an external &s;troke, which is mo&s;t frequently the ca&s;e in the apoplexy of the brain.</P>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of the remote and proximate cau&s;es of pneumony will furni&s;h us with a &s;till more re|markable analogy of the connection between a <HI>lo|cal</HI> affection, and a <HI>general</HI> di&s;ea&s;e of the &s;y&s;tem. The pneumony is produced by remote exciting cau|&s;es, which act on the whole &s;y&s;tem. The whole arterial &s;y&s;tem is frequently agitated by a fever in this di&s;order before a pain is perceived in the brea&s;t or &s;ides, and this fever generally con&s;titutes the &s;trength and danger of the di&s;ea&s;e. The expectoration which terminates the di&s;order in health, is always the effect of effu&s;ions pro|duced by a general di&s;ea&s;e, and even the vomicas, which &s;ometimes &s;ucceed a deficiency of bleeding in this di&s;order, always depend upon the &s;ame ge|neral cau&s;e. From this view of the analogy be|tween pneumony and pulmonary con&s;umption, it would &s;eem that the two di&s;ea&s;es differed from each other only by the &s;horter or longer operation of the cau&s;es which induce them, and by the great|er or le&s;s violence and duration of their &s;ymptoms. The pnuemony appears to be an <HI>acute</HI> con&s;ump|tion, and the con&s;umption a <HI>chronic</HI> pneumony. From the analogy of the pulmonary con&s;umption
<PB N="95" REF="026112_0099_0FCFF345C6478758">
with the diminutive term of certain fevers, I have taken the liberty of calling it a PNEUMONICULA.</P>
<P N="5">5. I infer that the pulmonary con&s;umption is a di&s;ea&s;e of the whole &s;y&s;tem, from its exi&s;tence without ulcers in the lungs. Of this there are many ca&s;es recorded in books of medicine.</P>
<P>DR. Leigh informs us in his natural hi&s;tory of Lanca&s;hire, that the con&s;umption was a very com|mon di&s;ea&s;e on the &s;ea coa&s;t of that country; but that it was not accompanied either by previous inflammation or ulcers in the lungs. It was general|ly attended, he &s;ays, by an unu&s;ual peevi&s;hne&s;s of temper.</P>
<P N="6">6. AND la&s;tly, I infer, that the pulmonary con|&s;umption is a di&s;ea&s;e of the whole &s;y&s;tem, from its being relieved, or cured, only by remedies which act upon the whole &s;y&s;tem. This will appear, I hope, hereafter, when we come to treat of the cure of this di&s;order.</P>
<P>LET us now inquire how far the principles I have laid down will apply to the &s;uppo&s;ed proximate cau&s;es of con&s;umption. The&s;e cau&s;es have been &s;aid to be&mdash;an ab&s;ce&s;s in the lungs, haemopty&s;is, tubercles, catarrh, hereditary diathe&s;is, contagion, and the matter of cutaneous eruptions or &s;ores re|pelled,
<PB N="96" REF="026112_0100_0FCFF34868E7EC80">
and thrown upon the lungs. I &s;hall make a few ob&s;ervations upon each of them.</P>
<P N="1">1. AN ab&s;ce&s;s in the lungs is generally the con|&s;equence of a neglected, or half cured pneumony. It is &s;eldom fatal, where it is not connected with a predi&s;po&s;ition to con&s;umption from general debili|ty, or where general debility is not previou&s;ly in|duced by the want of appetite, &s;leep, and exerci&s;e, which &s;ometimes accompanies that di&s;order of the lungs. This explanation of the production of con&s;umption by an ab&s;ce&s;s in the lungs, will re|ceive further &s;upport from attending to the effects of wounds in the lungs. How &s;eldom are they followed by pulmonary con&s;umption; and this only becau&s;e they are as &s;eldom accompanied by predi&s;po&s;ing general debility. I do not recollect a &s;ingle in&s;tance of this di&s;order having followed a wound in the lungs, either by the bayonet, or a bullet, during the late war. The recoveries which have &s;ucceeded &s;uch wounds, and frequently un|der the mo&s;t unfavorable circum&s;tances, &s;hew how very improbable it is that a much &s;lighter affection of the lungs &s;hould become the cau&s;e of a pulmo|nary con&s;umption.</P>
<P>A Briti&s;h officer, whom I met in the Briti&s;h camp, a few days after the battle of Brandywine, in
<PB N="97" REF="026112_0101_0FCFF34C2D7AD280">
September, 1777, informed me that the &s;urgeon general of the royal army had a&s;&s;ured him, that out of twenty-four &s;oldiers who had been admitted into the ho&s;pitals, during the campaign of 1776, with wounds in their lungs, twenty-three of them had recovered. Even primary di&s;ea&s;es of the lungs often exi&s;t with peculiar violence, or conti|nue for many years without inducing a con&s;umpti|on. I have never known but one in&s;tance of the hooping cough ending in con&s;umption, and all our books of medicine contain records of the a&s;th|ma continuing for 20 and 30 years without termi|nating in that di&s;order. The rea&s;on in both ca&s;es, mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to tho&s;e two original di&s;orders of the lungs not being accompanied by general debility. One fact more will &s;erve to throw &s;till further light upon the &s;ubject. Millers are much afflicted with a cough from floating particles of flour con|&s;tantly irritating their lungs, and yet they are not more &s;ubject to con&s;umptions than other labouring people. Hence "a miller's cough," is proverbial in &s;ome places, to denote a cough of long continu|ance without danger.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE haemopty&s;is is either a local di&s;ea&s;e, or it is the effect of general debility of the whole &s;y|&s;tem. When it is local, or when it is the effect of cau&s;es which induce a <HI>temporary</HI> or <HI>acute</HI> debility
<PB N="98" REF="026112_0102_0FCFF34DD281D6B8">
only in the &s;y&s;tem, it is &s;eldom followed by con|&s;umption. The accidental di&s;charge of blood from the lungs, from injuries, and from an ob&s;truction of the men&s;es in women, is of this kind. Many per&s;ons are affected by this &s;pecies of haemorrhage once or twice in their lives, without &s;uffering any inconvenience from it afterwards. I have met with &s;everal ca&s;es in which it has occurred for many years every time the body was expo&s;ed to any of the cau&s;es which induce <HI>&s;udden,</HI> direct, or indirect debility, and yet no con&s;umption has fol|lowed it. The late king of Pru&s;&s;ia informed Dr. Zimmerman that he had been frequently attacked by it during his &s;even years war, and yet he lived notwith&s;tanding above twenty years afterwards without any pulmonary complaints. It is only in per&s;ons who labour under <HI>chronic</HI> debility, that an haemopty&s;is is nece&s;&s;arily followed by con&s;ump|tion.</P>
<P N="3">3. I yield to the popular mode of expre&s;&s;ion when I &s;peak of a con&s;umption being produced by tubercles. But I maintain that they are the <HI>effects</HI> of general debility communicated to the bronchial ve&s;&s;els which cau&s;e them to effu&s;e a preternatural quantity of mucus. This mucus is &s;ometimes poured into the trachea from whence it is di&s;char|ged by hawking, more e&s;pecially in the morning;
<PB N="99" REF="026112_0103_0FCFF34F81D0D030">
for it is effu&s;ed more copiou&s;ly during the languid hours of &s;leep than in the day time. But this mucus is frequently effu&s;ed into the &s;ub&s;tance of the lungs, where it produces tho&s;e tumours we call tubercles. When this occurs, there is either no cough<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Med. Com. Vol. II.</NOTE> or a very dry one. That tubercles are formed in this way, I infer from the di&s;&s;ections and experi|ments of Dr. Stark<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Clinical and Anatomical Ob&s;ervations, p. 26, 27. See al&s;o Morgagni, letter xxii. 21.</NOTE>, who tells us, that he found them to con&s;i&s;t of inorganic matter&mdash;that he was unable to di&s;cover any connection between them and the pulmonary ve&s;&s;els, by means of the mi|cro&s;cope or injections, and that they fir&s;t opened into the trachea through the bronchial ve&s;&s;els. It is remarkable that the color and con&s;i&s;tence of the matter of which they are compo&s;ed, is nearly the &s;ame as the matter which is di&s;charged from the trachea, in the mo&s;t cough which occurs from a relaxation of the bronchial ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>I am aware that the&s;e tumours in the lungs have been a&s;cribed to &s;cropula. But the frequent oc|currence of con&s;umptions in per&s;ons in whom no &s;crophulous taint exi&s;ted, is &s;ufficient to refute this opinion. I have frequently directed my enqui|ries after this di&s;order in con&s;umptive patients, and
<PB N="100" REF="026112_0104_0FCF4948D7BDF508">
have met with very few ca&s;es which were produced by it. It is probable that it may frequently be a predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;e of con&s;umption in Great Britain, but I am &s;ure it is not in the United States of Ame|rica.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE catarrh is of two kind&mdash;acute and chro|nic, both of which are connected with general de|bility, but this debility is mo&s;t obvious in the chronic catarrh: hence we find it encrea&s;ed by every thing which acts upon the whole &s;y&s;tem, &s;uch as cold and damp weather, fatigue, and above all by old age, and relieved or cured by exerci&s;e, and every thing el&s;e which invigorates the whole &s;y&s;tem. This &s;pecies of catarrh often continues for twenty or thirty years without inducing pulmo|nary con&s;umption, in per&s;ons who pur&s;ue active occupations.</P>
<P N="5">5. IN the hereditary con&s;umption there is either an hereditary debility of the whole &s;y&s;tem, or an hereditary mad-conformation of the brea&s;t. In the latter ca&s;e, the con&s;umption is the effect of weak|ne&s;s communicated to the whole &s;y&s;tem, by the long continuance of difficult re&s;piration, or of &s;uch injuries being done to the lungs as are incompati|ble with health and life. It is remarkable, that
<PB N="101" REF="026112_0105_0FCFF3549374E948">
the con&s;umptive diathe&s;is is more frequently deri|ved from paternal than maternal ance&s;tors.</P>
<P N="6">6. PHYSICIANS the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for accu|rate ob&s;ervations have agreed, that the pulmonary con&s;umption may be communicated by contagion. However doubtful it may be in temperate, it can|not be controverted in warm climates. Morgagni informs us that, Val&s;alva (who was predi&s;po&s;ed to the con&s;umption) was &s;o &s;atisfied of its contagious nature, that he con&s;tantly avoided being pre&s;ent at the di&s;&s;ection of the lungs of per&s;ons who had died of that di&s;order. I know that its progre&s;s in whole families has been a&s;cribed to a &s;amene&s;s of original con&s;titution, or mal-conformation of the brea&s;t in the members of the &s;ame family, or the fatigue which is incurred by attending, and the grief which follows the lo&s;s of relations who peri&s;h by that di&s;order. Perhaps many of the ca&s;es of con&s;umption, which have been a&s;cribed to conta|gion, may be accounted for by calling in the debi|litating operation of one or both of tho&s;e cau&s;es; but there are ca&s;es of the di&s;ea&s;e being communicated by contagion, which cannot be re&s;olved into the influence of either fatigue or grief.</P>
<P>THE late Dr. Beard&s;ley, of Connecticut, in|formed me that he had known &s;everal black &s;laves,
<PB N="102" REF="026112_0106_0FCFF35E6F3484B8">
affected by a con&s;umption which had previou&s;ly &s;wept away &s;everal of the white members of the family to which they belonged. In tho&s;e &s;laves no &s;u&s;picion was entertained of the mo&s;t di&s;tant relation&s;hip to the per|&s;ons from whom they had had contracted the di&s;or|der; nor had fatigue or grief, from the cau&s;es be|forementioned, been &s;uppo&s;ed to have had the lea&s;t &s;hare in debilitating their bodies. Admitting then contagion to act as a remote cau&s;e of con&s;umption, it does not militate again&s;t the theory which I have aimed to e&s;tabli&s;h; for if the contagion follow the analogy of all the other contagions that we are ac|quainted with, it mu&s;t act by debilitating the whole &s;y&s;tem. The approach of the jail fever and the plague is often indicated by general languor. The influenza and the mea&s;les are always accompanied by general debility, but the &s;mall pox furni&s;hes an analogy to the ca&s;e in que&s;tion more directly in point. The contagion of this di&s;order, whether received by the medium of the air or the &s;kin, never fails of producing a di&s;ea&s;e of the whole &s;y|&s;tem, before it di&s;covers it&s;elf in affections of tho&s;e parts of the body on which the contagion pro|duced its fir&s;t operation.&mdash;I am di&s;po&s;ed to believe, from &s;everal ca&s;es which have come under my no|tice, that the contagion which produces the con|&s;umption &s;eldom acts in le&s;s than two or three months after it is received into the &s;y&s;tem. I once
<PB N="103" REF="026112_0107_0FCFF360F042EF48">
attended a lady, in whom the contagion did not di&s;cover it&s;elf in the lungs for nearly a year after &s;he had been expo&s;ed to it, by attending a &s;i&s;ter who had died of the con&s;umption. In this ca&s;e the effects of fatigue, and of grief were entirely worn away from the &s;y&s;tem by time, as well as by chearful &s;ociety.</P>
<P N="7">7. I GRANT that cutaneous humors, and the mat|ter of old &s;ores, when repelled, or &s;uddenly healed, have in &s;ome ca&s;es fallen upon the lungs, and pro|duced con&s;umption. But I believe, in every ca&s;e where this has happened, the con&s;umption was preceded by general debility, or that it was not induced, until the whole &s;y&s;tem had been pre|viou&s;ly debilitated by a tedious and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing cough.</P>
<P>IF the rea&s;onings founded upon the facts which have been mentioned be ju&s;t, then it follows,</P>
<P N="3">III. THAT the cough, tubercles, ulcers, and pu|rulent or bloody di&s;charges which occur in the pulmonary con&s;umption, are the <HI>effects</HI> and not the <HI>cau&s;es</HI> of the di&s;ea&s;e; and, that all attempts to cure it, by inquiring after tubercles and ulcers, or into the quality of the di&s;charges from the lungs, are as fruitle&s;s as an attempt would be to di&s;cover the cau&s;es or cure of drop&s;ies, by an examination of the
<PB N="104" REF="026112_0108_0FCFF36636492FB0">
qualities of collections of water, or to find out the cau&s;es and cure of fevers by the quantity or qua|lity of the di&s;charges which take place in tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es from the kidneys and &s;kin. I admit that the cough, ulcers, and tubercles, after they are formed, increa&s;e the danger of the di&s;ea&s;e, by be|coming new cau&s;es of &s;timulus to the &s;y&s;tem, but in this they are upon a footing with tho&s;e effu&s;ions in the vi&s;cera, which take place in the intermitting fever, which though they con&s;titute no part of its cau&s;e, frequently produce &s;ymptoms and a termina|tion which are wholly unconnected with the ori|ginal di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>THE tendency of general debility to produce a di&s;ea&s;e of the lungs appears in many ca&s;es, as well as in the pulmonary con&s;umption. Dr. Lind tells us, that the la&s;t &s;tage of the jail fever was often marked by a cough. I have &s;eldom been di&s;appointed in looking for a cough and a copious excretion of mu|cus and phlegm after the 14th or 15th days of the nervous fever. Two ca&s;es of hypocondria&s;is under my care, ended in fatal di&s;orders of the lungs. The debility of old age is generally accompanied by a trouble&s;ome cough, and the debility which precedes death, generally di&s;covers its la&s;t &s;ymp|toms in the lungs,&mdash;hence, mo&s;t people die with what are called the <HI>Rattles.</HI> They are produced
<PB N="105" REF="026112_0109_0FCFF36752BFF510">
by a &s;udden and copious effu&s;ion of mucus in the bronchial ve&s;&s;els of the lungs.</P>
<P>SHOULD it be a&s;ked, why does general debility terminate by a di&s;order in the lungs, rather than in any other part of the body?&mdash;I an&s;wer,&mdash;that it &s;eems to be a law of the &s;y&s;tem, that general de|bility &s;hould always produce as a &s;ymptom &s;ome local di&s;ea&s;e. This local di&s;ea&s;e &s;ometimes mani|fe&s;ts it&s;elf in dy&s;pep&s;ia, as in the general debility which follows grief;&mdash;&s;ometimes it di&s;covers it|&s;elf in a diarrhoea as in the general debility which &s;ucceeds to fear.&mdash;Again it appears in the brain,&mdash;as in the general debility which &s;ucceeds intemperance, and the con&s;tant or violent exerci&s;e of the under&s;tanding, or of &s;timulating pa&s;&s;ions; but it more frequently appears in the lungs, as the con&s;equence of general debility. It would &s;eem as if the debility in the ca&s;es of con&s;umption is &s;eat|ed chiefly in the blood ve&s;&s;els, while that debility which terminates in di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;tomach and bowels, is confined chiefly to the nerves,&mdash;and that the local affections of the brain ari&s;e from a debi|lity, invading alike the nervous and arterial &s;y|&s;tems. What makes it more probable, that the arterial &s;y&s;tem is <HI>materially</HI> affected in the con|&s;umption is, that the di&s;order mo&s;t frequently oc|curs in tho&s;e periods of life, and in tho&s;e habits in
<PB N="106" REF="026112_0110_0FCFF369A562C148">
which a peculiar &s;tate of irritability or excitability is &s;uppo&s;ed to be pre&s;ent in the arterial &s;y&s;tem; al&s;o in tho&s;e climates in which there are the mo&s;t frequent vici&s;&s;itudes in the temperature of the weather. It is remarkable, that that the debility in the inhabitants of the We&s;t Indies, whether produced by the heat of the climate, or the ex|ce&s;&s;ive pur&s;uits of bu&s;ine&s;s or plea&s;ure, generally terminates in drop&s;y, or in &s;ome di&s;order of the alimentary canal.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;aid, that it &s;eemed to be a law of the &s;y|&s;tem, that general debility &s;hould always produce as a &s;ymptom &s;ome local affection. But to this law there are &s;ometimes exceptions: The Atro|phy appears to be a con&s;umption without an affection of the lungs.&mdash;This di&s;order is frequent|ly mentioned by the writers of the 16th and 17th centuries by the name of Tabes. I have &s;een &s;eve|ral in&s;tances of it in adults, but more in children, and a greater number in the children of black than of white parents. The hectic fever, and even the night &s;weats, were as obvious in &s;everal of the&s;e ca&s;es, as in tho&s;e con&s;umptions where general de|bility had di&s;covered it&s;elf in an affection of the lungs.</P>
<P>I COME now to make a few ob&s;ervations upon
<PB N="107" REF="026112_0111_0FCFF36E29BC20B8">
the CURE of con&s;umption; and here I hope it will appear, that the theory which I have delivered admits of an early and very important application to practice.</P>
<P>IF the con&s;umption be a di&s;ea&s;e of general de|bility, it becomes us to attempt the cure of it in its fir&s;t &s;tage,&mdash;that is, before it produce the &s;ymp|toms of cough, bloody or purulent di&s;charges from the lungs, and inflammatory or hectic fever. The &s;ymptoms which mark this fir&s;t &s;tage, are too &s;el|dom ob&s;erved; or if ob&s;erved, they are too often treated with equal neglect by patients and phy&s;ici|ans. I &s;hall briefly enumerate the&s;e &s;ymptoms. They are a &s;light fever encrea&s;ed by the lea&s;t exer|ci&s;e,&mdash;a burning and dryne&s;s in the palms of the hands, more e&s;pecially towards evening,&mdash;rheumy eyes upon waking from &s;leep,&mdash;an encrea&s;e of urine,&mdash;a dryne&s;s of the &s;kin, more e&s;pecially of the feet in the morning,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The three la&s;t mentioned &s;ymptoms are taken notice of by Dr Bennet, in his Treati&s;e upon the Nature and Cure of the Con&s;umption as <HI>precur&s;ors</HI> of the di&s;order.

<P>IT would be ea&s;y for me to mention ca&s;es in which every &s;ymptom that has been enumerated has occurred within my own ob&s;ervations. I wi&s;h them to be committed to memory by young prac|titioners; and if they derive the &s;ame advantages from attending to them, which I have done, I am &s;ure they will not regret the trouble they have taken for that purpo&s;e. It is probable, while a morbid &s;tate of the lungs is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the proximate cau&s;e of this di&s;order, they will not de|rive much reputation or emolument from curing it in its forming &s;tage; but let them remember, that in all attempts to di&s;cover the cau&s;es and cures of di&s;ea&s;es, which have been deemed incurable, a phy&s;ician will do nothing effectual until he acquire a perfect indifference to his own intere&s;t and fame.</P>
<P>THE remedies for con&s;umption in this &s;tage of the di&s;order are &s;imple and certain. They con&s;i&s;t,
<PB N="109" REF="026112_0113_0FCFF370CC0550F8">
in a de&s;ertion of all the remote, and exciting cau&s;es of the di&s;order, particularly &s;edentary em|ployments, damp or cold &s;ituations, and whatever tends to weaken the &s;y&s;tem. When the di&s;ea&s;e has not yielded to this de&s;ertion of its remote and exciting cau&s;es, I have recommended the <HI>cold bath, &s;teel,</HI> and <HI>bark</HI> with great advantage. How|ever improper or even dangerous the&s;e remedies may be after the di&s;ea&s;e a&s;&s;umes an inflammatory or hectic type, and produces an affection of the lungs, they are perfectly &s;afe and extremely u&s;eful in the &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem which has been de&s;crib|ed. The u&s;e of the bark will readily be admitted by all tho&s;e practitioners who believe the pulmo|nary con&s;umption to depend upon a &s;crophulous diathe&s;is. Should even the lungs be affected by &s;crophulous tumors, it is no objection to the u&s;e of the bark; for there is no rea&s;on why it &s;hould not be as u&s;eful in &s;crophulous tumors of the lungs, as of the glands of the throat, provided it be given before tho&s;e tumors have produced inflammation; and in this ca&s;e, no prudent practitioner will ever pre&s;cribe it in &s;crophula when &s;eated even in the external parts of the body. To the&s;e remedies &s;hould be added a diet moderately &s;timulating, and gentle exerci&s;e. I &s;hall hereafter mention the dif|ferent &s;pecies of exerci&s;e, and the manner in which each of them &s;hould be u&s;ed &s;o as to derive the ut|mo&s;t
<PB N="110" REF="026112_0114_0FCFF3724D808EE8">
advantage from them. I can &s;ay nothing of the u&s;e of &s;alt-water, or &s;ea-air in this &s;tage of the con&s;umption from my own experience. I have heard them commended by a phy&s;ician of Rhode-I&s;land; and if they be u&s;ed before the di&s;ea&s;e has di&s;covered it&s;elf in pulmonary affections, I can ea&s;i|ly conceive they may do &s;ervice.</P>
<P>IF the &s;imple remedies which have been men|tioned have been neglected, in the fir&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;order, it generally terminates in different peri|ods of time, in pulmonary affections; which &s;hew them&s;elves under one of the three following forms.&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. A fever, accompanied by a cough, a hard pul&s;e, and a di&s;charge of blood, or mucous mat|ter from the lungs.</P>
<P N="2">2. A fever of the hectic kind, accompanied by chilly fits, and night &s;weats, and a pul&s;e full, quick, and occa&s;ionally hard. The di&s;charges from the lungs in this &s;tate of the di&s;order, are frequent|ly purulent.</P>
<P N="3">3. A fever with a weak quick pul&s;e, a trouble|&s;ome cough, and copious purulent di&s;charges from the lungs, a hoar&s;e and weak voice, and chilly fits

and night &s;weats, alternating occa&s;ionally with a diarrhoea.</P>
<P>THESE three different forms of the pulmonary affection have been di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of the fir&s;t, &s;econd, and third &s;tages of the con&s;ump|tion; but as they do not always &s;ucceed each other in the order in which they have been mentioned, I &s;hall hereafter di&s;tingui&s;h them by the name of &s;pecies, in conformity to our modern nomencla|tures of medicine, although it would be more pro|per, on &s;ome accounts, to con&s;ider them as differ|ent &s;tates of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t I &s;hall call the INFLAMMATORY&mdash;the &s;e|cond the HECTIC, and the third the TYPHUS &s;pecies. I have &s;een the pulmonary con&s;umption come on &s;ometimes with all the &s;ymptoms of the &s;econd, and &s;ometimes with the mo&s;t of the &s;ymptoms of the third &s;pecies; and I have &s;een two ca&s;es in which a hard pul&s;e, and other &s;ymptoms of inflammatory ac|tion appeared in the la&s;t hours of life. It is agree|able to pur&s;ue the analogy of this di&s;order with a pneumony, or an acute inflammation of the lungs. They both make their fir&s;t appearance in the &s;ame &s;ea&s;ons of the year. It is true, the pneumony mo&s;t frequently attacks with inflammatory &s;ymptoms; but it &s;ometimes occurs with &s;ymptoms which for|bid

blood-letting, and I have more than once &s;een it attended by &s;ymptoms which required the u&s;e of wine and bark. The pneumony is attended at fir&s;t by a dry cough, and an expectoration of &s;treaks of blood&mdash;the cough in the con&s;umption, in like manner, is at fir&s;t dry, and attended by a di&s;charge of blood from the lungs, which is more copious than in the pneumony, only becau&s;e the lungs are more relaxed in the former than in the latter di&s;|order. There are ca&s;es of pneumony in which no cough attends. I have &s;een ca&s;es of pulmona|ry con&s;umption, in which nothing but a difficulty of breathing di&s;covered a morbid &s;tate of the lungs, and one in which there was an entire ab&s;ence of cough.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the year 1785, I attended a young lady who had complained of a pain in her right &s;ide, and had frequent chills with a fever of the hectic kind. They all gave way 10 frequent and gentle bleedings. In the &s;ummer of 1786, &s;he was &s;eized with the &s;ame complaints, and as &s;he had great objections to bleeding, &s;he con&s;ulted a phy&s;ician who grati|fied her, by attempting to cure her by recommending exer|ci&s;e and country air. In the autumn &s;he returned to the ci|ty much wor&s;e than when &s;he left it. I was again &s;ent for, and found her confined to her bed with a pain in her right &s;ide, but without the lea&s;t cough or fever. Her pul&s;e was preternaturally &s;low. She could lie only on her left &s;ide. She &s;ometimes complained of acute flying pains in her head, bowels, and limbs. About a month before her death, which was on the 3d of May 1787, her pul&s;e became quick, and &s;he had a little hecking cough, but without any di&s;charge from her lungs. Upon my fir&s;t vi&s;it to her in the preceding autumn, I had told her friends that I believed &s;he had an ab&s;ce&s;s in her lungs. The want of fever and cough afterwards how|ever gave me rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that I had been mi&s;taken.

I complied with this reque&s;t, and in company with Dr. Hall, examined her tho|rax. We found the left lobe of the lungs perfectly &s;ound; the right lobe adhered to the pleura, in &s;eparating of which, Dr. Hall plunged his hand into a large &s;ac which contained about half a pint of purulent matter, and which had nearly de&s;troyed the whole &s;ub&s;tance of the right lobe of the lungs.</P><P>I have met with only two other ca&s;es of con&s;umption in which there was an ab&s;ence of a <HI>quick</HI> pul&s;e.

the blood, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to reduce it. I have u&s;ed this remedy with great &s;ucce&s;s in every ca&s;e of con&s;umption, attended by a hard pul&s;e, or a pul&s;e rendered weak by a laborious tran&s;mi&s;|&s;ion of the blood through the lungs. In the months of February and March in the year 1781, I bled a Methodi&s;t mini&s;ter, who was affected by this &s;pecies of con&s;umption, fifteen times in the cour&s;e of &s;ix weeks. The quan|tity of blood drawn at each bleeding was never le&s;s than eight ounces, and it was at all times co|vered with an inflammatory cru&s;t. By the addition of country air, and moderate exerci&s;e, to this copi|ous evacuation, in the en&s;uing &s;pring he recovered his health, &s;o perfectly as to di&s;charge all the du|ties of his profe&s;&s;ion for many years, nor was he ever afflicted afterwards with a di&s;order in his brea&s;t. I have in another in&s;tance, bled a citizen of Philadelphia eight times in two weeks, in this &s;pecies of con&s;umption, and with the happie&s;t ef|fects. The blood drawn at each bleeding was al|ways &s;izy, and never le&s;s in quantity than ten ounces. To the&s;e ca&s;es I might add many others of con&s;umptive per&s;ons who have been perfectly cured by frequent, and of many others who&s;e lives have been prolonged by occa&s;ional bleedings.&mdash; But I am &s;orry to add, that I could relate many more ca&s;es of con&s;umptive patients, who have died

martyrs to their prejudices again&s;t the u&s;e of this invaluable remedy. A common objection to it is, that it has been u&s;ed without &s;ucce&s;s in this di&s;|order. When this has been the ca&s;e, I &s;u&s;pect that it has been u&s;ed in one of the other two &s;pe|cies of pulmonary con&s;umption which have been mentioned, for it has unfortunately been too fa|&s;hionable among phy&s;icians to pre&s;cribe the &s;ame remedies in every &s;tage and &s;pecies of the &s;ame di&s;order; and this I take to be the rea&s;on why the &s;ame medicines, which in the hands of &s;ome phy&s;icians, are either inert, or in&s;truments of mi&s;|chief, are, in the hands of others, u&s;ed with more or le&s;s &s;ucce&s;s in every ca&s;e in which they are pre|&s;cribed. Another objection to bleeding in the in|flammatory &s;pecies of con&s;umption, is derived from the apparent and even &s;en&s;ible weakne&s;s of the patient. The men who urge this objection, do not he&s;itate to take from &s;ixty to an hundred ounces of bood from a patient in a pneumony in in the cour&s;e of five or &s;ix days, without con&s;ider|ing that the debility in the latter ca&s;e is &s;uch as to confine a patient to his bed, while in the former ca&s;e, the patient's &s;trength is &s;uch as to enable him to walk about his hou&s;e, and even to attend to his ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s. The difference between the debility in the two di&s;ea&s;es, con&s;i&s;ts in its being <HI>acute</HI> in the one, and <HI>chronic</HI> in the other. It is
<PB N="119" REF="026112_0123_0FCFF380D09481C0">
true, the preternatural or convul&s;ive action of the arteries is &s;omewhat greater in the pneu|mony, than in the inflammatory con&s;umption; but the plethora on which the nece&s;&s;ity of bleed|ing is partly founded, is certainly greater in the inflammatory con&s;umption than in pneumony.&mdash; This is evident from women, and even nur&s;es, di&s;|charging from four to &s;ix ounces of men&s;trual blood every month, while they are labouring with the mo&s;t inflammatory &s;ymptoms of the di&s;order; nor is it to be wondered at, &s;ince the appetite is frequently unimpaired, and the generation of blood continues to be the &s;ame, as in perfect health.</P>
<P>DR. CULLEN recommends the u&s;e of bleeding in con&s;umptions in order to le&s;&s;en the inflamma|tion of the ulcers in the lungs, and thereby to di&s;po&s;e them to heal. From the te&s;timonies of the re|lief which bleeding affords in external ulcers and tumors accompanied by inflammation, I am di&s;|po&s;ed to expect the &s;ame benefit from it in inflamed ulcers and tumors in the lungs: Whether, there|fore, we adopt Dr Cullen's theory of con&s;umption, and treat it as a local di&s;ea&s;e, or a&s;&s;ent to the one which I have delivered, &s;till repeated bleedings ap|pear to be equally nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="026112_0124_0FCFF3825DA41AB0">I HAVE &s;een two ca&s;es of inflammatory con|&s;umption, attended by an hoemorrhage of a quart of blood from the lungs. I agreed at fir&s;t with the friends of the&s;e patients in expecting a rapid termination of their di&s;order in death, but to the joy and &s;urpri&s;e of all connected with them, they both recovered. I a&s;cribed their recovery wholly to the inflammatory action of their &s;y&s;tems being &s;uddenly reduced by a &s;pontaneous di&s;charge of blood. The&s;e facts, I hope, will &s;erve to e&s;tabli&s;h the u&s;efulne&s;s of blood-letting in the inflammatory &s;tate of con&s;umption, with tho&s;e phy&s;icians who are yet di&s;po&s;ed to tru&s;t more to the fortuitous operations of nature, than to the deci&s;ions of rea&s;on and ex|perience.</P>
<P>I HAVE always found this remedy to be more nece&s;&s;ary in the winter and fir&s;t &s;pring months, than at any other &s;ea&s;on. We obtain by means of repeated bleedings, &s;uch a mitigation of all the &s;ymptoms as enables the patient to u&s;e exerci&s;e with advantage as &s;oon as the weather becomes &s;o dry and &s;ettled, as to admit of his going abroad every day.</P>
<P>THE relief obtained by bleeding, is &s;o certain in this &s;pecies of con&s;umption, that I often u&s;e it
<PB N="121" REF="026112_0125_0FCFF38481A63208">
as a palliative remedy, where I do not expect it will perform a cure. I was lately made happy in finding, that I am not &s;ingular in this practice. Dr. Hamilton, of Lynn Regis, u&s;ed it with &s;ucce&s;s in a con&s;umption, which was the effect of a mo&s;t deplorable &s;crophula, without entertaining the lea&s;t hope of its per|forming a cure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;ervations on &s;crophulous affection.</NOTE>. In tho&s;e ca&s;es where inflamma|matory action attends the la&s;t &s;cene of the di&s;order, there is often more relief obtained by a little bleed|ing than by the u&s;e of opiates, and it is always a more humane pre&s;cription, in de&s;perate ca&s;es, than the u&s;ual remedies of vomits and bli&s;ters.</P>
<P>I ONCE bled a &s;ea captain, whom I had declared to be within a few hours of his di&s;&s;olution, in or|der to relieve him of uncommon pain, and difficul|ty in breathing. His pul&s;e was at the &s;ame time hard. The evacuation, though it con&s;i&s;ted of only four ounces of blood, had the wi&s;hed for effect, and his death, I have rea&s;on to believe, was ren|dered more ea&s;y by it. The blood, in this ca&s;e, was covered with a buffy coat.</P>
<P>THE quantity of blood drawn in every ca&s;e of inflammatory con&s;umption, &s;hould be determined
<PB N="122" REF="026112_0126_0FCFF385813D8910">
by the force of the pul&s;e, and the habits of the pa|tient. I have &s;eldom taken more than eight, but more frequently only &s;ix ounces at a time. It is much better to repeat the bleeding once or twice a week, than to u&s;e it le&s;s frequently, but in larger quantities.</P>
<P>FROM many years experience of the efficacy of bleeding in this &s;pecies of con&s;umption, I feel my|&s;elf authori&s;ed to a&s;&s;ert, that where a greater pro|portion of per&s;ons die of con&s;umption when it makes it fir&s;t appearance in the lungs, with &s;ymp|toms of inflammatory diathe&s;is, than die of ordi|nary pneumonies, (provided exerci&s;e be u&s;ed after|wards) it mu&s;t in nine ca&s;es out of ten, be a&s;cribed to the ignorance, or erroneous theories of phy&s;i|cians, or to the ob&s;tinacy or timidity of patients.</P>
<P>IN &s;peaking thus confidently of the nece&s;&s;ity and benefits of bleeding in the inflammatory &s;pe|cies of con&s;umption, I confine my&s;elf to ob&s;erva|tions made chiefly in the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania. It is po&s;&s;ible the inhabitants of European countries and cities, may &s;o far have pa&s;&s;ed the &s;imple ages of inflammatory di&s;orders, as never to exhibit tho&s;e &s;ymptoms on which I have founded the indication of blood-letting. I am di&s;po&s;ed to believe more|over that in mo&s;t of the &s;outhern &s;tates of America,
<PB N="123" REF="026112_0127_0FCFF38795006F30">
the inflammatory action of the arterial &s;y&s;tem is of too tran&s;ient a nature to admit of the repeated bleedings in the con&s;umption which are u&s;ed with &s;o much advantage in the middle and northern &s;tates.</P>
<P>IN reviewing the prejudices again&s;t this excel|lent remedy in con&s;umptions, I have frequently wi&s;hed to di&s;cover &s;uch a &s;ub&s;titute for it as would with equal &s;afety and certainty take down the morbid excitement, and action of the arterial &s;y|&s;tem. I believe in the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a remedy; but until it be di&s;covered, it becomes us to combat the prejudices again&s;t bleeding; and to derive all the advantages from it which have been mentioned.</P>
<P N="2">2. A SECOND remedy for the inflammatory &s;pecies of con&s;umption &s;hould be &s;ought for in a MILK and VEGETABLE DIET. In tho&s;e ca&s;es where the milk does not lie ea&s;y on the &s;tomach, it &s;hould be mix|ed with water, or it &s;hould be taken without its chee&s;y or oily parts, as in whey, or butter-milk, or it &s;hould be taken without &s;kimming; for there are ca&s;es in which milk will agree with the &s;to|mach in this &s;tate, and in no other. The oil of the milk probably helps to promote the &s;olution of its curds in the &s;tomach. It is &s;eldom in the pow|er of phy&s;icians to pre&s;cribe a&s;&s;es or goats milk in
<PB N="124" REF="026112_0128_0FCFF38E301CB238">
this di&s;order; but a good &s;ub&s;titute may be prepa|red for them by adding to cows milk a little &s;ugar, and a third or fourth part of water, or of a weak infu&s;ion of green tea. The vegetables which are eaten in this &s;tate of the di&s;order, &s;hould contain as little &s;timulus as po&s;&s;ible. It would &s;eem if the moderate portion of &s;acharine matter which is contained in certain fruits &s;uch as &s;trawberries, grapes, and &s;weet apples were peculiarly agreeable and u&s;eful, for each of the&s;e fruits has been &s;aid to have cured the con&s;umption. In tho&s;e ca|&s;es where the &s;tomach is di&s;po&s;ed to dy&s;pep&s;ia, a little animal food, al&s;o &s;oft boiled eggs, may be ta|ken with &s;afety, mixed with vegetable aliment. Where there is no morbid affection of the &s;to|mach, I have &s;een the white meats eaten without encrea&s;ing the inflammatory &s;ymptoms of the di&s;|ea&s;e. The tran&s;ition from a full diet to milk and vegetables &s;hould be gradual, and the addition of animal to vegetable aliment, &s;hould be made with the &s;ame caution. From the neglect of this direc|tion, much error, both in theory and practice, has ari&s;en in the treatment of con&s;umptions.</P>
<P>IN every ca&s;e it will be better for the patient to eat four or five, rather than only two or three meals in a day. A le&s;s &s;timulus is by this means communicated to the &s;y&s;tem, and le&s;s chyle is
<PB N="125" REF="026112_0129_0FCFF390579BB380">
mixed with the blood in a given time. Of &s;o much importance do I conceive this direction to be, that I &s;eldom pre&s;cribe for a chronic di&s;ea&s;e of any kind without enforcing it.</P>
<P N="3">3. VOMITS have been much commended by Dr. Read in this di&s;order. From their indi&s;crimi|nate u&s;e in every &s;pecies of con&s;umption, I am &s;a|tisfied they have oftener done harm than good. In ca&s;es where a patient objects to bleeding, or where a phy&s;ician doubts of its propriety, vomits may always be &s;ub&s;tituted in its room with great advantage.</P>
<P N="4">4. NITRE in moderate do&s;es of ten or fifteen grains taken three or four times a day, has &s;ome|times done &s;ervice in this di&s;order; but I believe it has been only when the di&s;ea&s;e has appeared with inflammatory &s;ymptoms. Care &s;hould be taken not to per&s;evere too long in the u&s;e of this remedy as it is apt to impair the appetite. I have known one ca&s;e in which it produced an ob&s;tinate dy&s;pep|&s;ia, and a di&s;po&s;ition to the colic; but it removed at the &s;ame time, the &s;ymptoms of pulmonary con|&s;umption.</P>
<P N="5">5. COLD and dry air, when combined with the exerci&s;e of <HI>walking,</HI> de&s;erves to be mentioned as an antiphlogi&s;tic remedy. I have repeatedly
<PB N="126" REF="026112_0130_0FCFF3949B80DCF0">
pre&s;cribed it in this &s;pecies of the con&s;umption with advantage, and have often had the plea&s;ure of find|ing a &s;ingle walk of two or three miles in a clear cold day, produce nearly the &s;ame diminution of the force and frequency of the pul&s;e, as the lo&s;s of &s;ix or eight ounces of blood.</P>
<P>I COME now to treat of the palliative remedies which are proper in the</P>
<P N="2">II. OR HECTIC SPECIES of Con&s;umption. Here we begin to behold the di&s;order in a new and more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing form than in the &s;pecies which has been de&s;cribed. There is in this &s;pecies of con|&s;umption the &s;ame complication of inflammatory and typhus diathe&s;is which occurs in the typhoid and puerperile fevers, and of cour&s;e the &s;ame dif|ficulty in treating it &s;ucce&s;sfully; for the &s;ame re|medies do good and harm, according as the former or latter diathe&s;is prevails in the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>ALL that I &s;hall &s;ay upon this &s;pecies is, that the treatment of it &s;hould be accommodated to the predominance of inflammatory or typhus &s;ymp|toms, for the hectic &s;pecies pre&s;ents each of them alternately every week, and &s;ometimes every day to the hand or eye of a phy&s;ician. When a hard pul&s;e with acute pains in the &s;ide and brea&s;t occur, bleeding and other remedies for the inflammatory
<PB N="127" REF="026112_0131_0FCF49511705FF48">
&s;pecies mu&s;t be u&s;ed; but when the di&s;ea&s;e exhi|bits a predominance of typhus &s;ymptoms, the re|medies for that &s;pecies to be mentioned immedi|ately, &s;hould be pre&s;cribed in moderate do&s;es. There are &s;everal palliative medicines which have been found u&s;eful in the hectic &s;pecies, but they are &s;uch as belong alike to the other two &s;pecies; and therefore will be mentioned hereafter in a place a&s;&s;igned to them.</P>
<P>I AM &s;orry, however, to add, that where bleed|ing has not been indicated, I have &s;eldom been able to afford much relief by medicine in this &s;pecies of con&s;umption. I have u&s;ed alternately the mo&s;t gentle, and the mo&s;t powerful vegetable and me|tallic tonics to no purpo&s;e. Even ar&s;enic has failed in my hands of affording the lea&s;t alleviation of the hectic fever. I conceive the removal of this fever, to be the great de&s;ideratum in the cure of con&s;umption, and &s;hould it be found after all our re&s;earches to exi&s;t only in exerci&s;e, it will be no departure from a law of nature; for I believe there are no di&s;ea&s;es of equal degrees of chronic debility, in which medicines are of any more effica|cy, than they are in the hectic fever of the pulmo|nary con&s;umption.</P>

<P>THE fir&s;t of the&s;e are STIMULATING MEDICINES. However ju&s;t the complaints of Dr. Fothergill may be again&s;t the u&s;e of bal&s;ams in the inflamma|tory and mixed &s;pecies of con&s;umption, I am &s;atisfied that they are not only &s;afe, but u&s;eful likewi&s;e in mitigating the &s;ymptoms of weak action in the arterial &s;y&s;tem. I have therefore frequently pre&s;cribed the bal&s;am of copaivae, of Peru, the oil of amber, and different preparations of turpentine and tar in moderate do&s;es with obvious advantage. Garlic, the juice of dandelyon, a &s;trong tea made of horehound, and a decoction of the inner bark of the wild cherry tree;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prunus Virginiana.</NOTE> al&s;o bitters of all kinds, have all been found &s;afe and u&s;eful tonics in this &s;pecies of the con&s;umption. Even the Peruvian bark it&s;elf &s;o often and &s;o generally condemned in con&s;umptions is always an innocent and frequently an active medicine where there is a total ab&s;ence of inflammatory diathe&s;is in this di&s;order. With the&s;e medicines &s;hould be combined</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="129" REF="026112_0133_0FCFF39814B37BF8">2. A CORDIAL and STIMUMATING DIET. Milk and vegetables &s;o proper in the inflammatory, are improper when taken alone in this &s;pecies of con&s;umption. I believe they often accelerate that decay of appetite and diarrhoea, which form the clo&s;ing &s;cene of the di&s;order. I think I have &s;een advantages from the u&s;e, not only of fre&s;h, but of &s;alted animal food when pre&s;cribed in the total ab|&s;ence of inflammatory diathe&s;is. Oy&s;ters, it has been &s;aid, have performed cures of con&s;umption. If they have, it mu&s;t have been only when they were eaten in that &s;pecies of it which is now under con&s;ideration. They are a mo&s;t &s;avoury and whole|&s;ome article of diet in all di&s;ea&s;es attended with &s;ymptoms of general debility. I have found the &s;ame advantage from dividing the meals here that I mentioned under a former head. The exhibi|tion of food in this ca&s;e, &s;hould not be left to the calls of appetite, any more than the exhibition of a medicine. Indeed food may be made to &s;upply the place of cordial medicines, by keeping up a con&s;tant and gentle action in the whole &s;y&s;tem. For this rea&s;on, I have frequently advi&s;ed my patients never to &s;uffer their &s;tomachs to be empty, even for a &s;ingle hour. I have &s;ometimes aimed to keep up the influence of a gentle action in the &s;tomach upon the whole &s;y&s;tem, by advi&s;ing them to eat in the night, in order to obviate the increa&s;e of the
<PB N="130" REF="026112_0134_0FCFF39D6E07F368">
excretion in the lungs and of the cough in the morning, which are brought on in part by the in|crea&s;e of debility from the long ab&s;traction of the &s;timulus of aliment during the night.</P>
<P>HOWEVER &s;afe and even u&s;eful the cordial me|dicines and diet which have been mentioned may appear, yet I am &s;orry to add, that I have never &s;een any other advantages from them than a miti|gation of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ymptoms, except when they have been combined with &s;uitable and long con|tinued exerci&s;e. Even under this favourable cir|cum&s;tance, they are often ineffectual; for there frequently occurs in this &s;pecies of con&s;umption, &s;uch a de&s;truction of the &s;ub&s;tance and functions of the lungs, as to preclude the po&s;&s;ibility of a re|covery by the u&s;e of any of the remedies which have been di&s;covered.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;aid formerly that the three &s;pecies of con&s;umption do not ob&s;erve any regular cour&s;e in &s;ucceeding each other. They are not only com|plicated in &s;ome in&s;tances, but they often appear and di&s;appear half a dozen times in the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, according to the influence of the wea|ther, dre&s;s, diet, and the pa&s;&s;ions, upon the &s;y&s;tem. The great &s;ecret, therefore, of treating this di&s;or|der con&s;i&s;ts in accommodating all the remedies that
<PB N="131" REF="026112_0135_0FCFF3A2256DB9E0">
have been mentioned to the predominance of ei|ther of the three &s;pecies, or to the different &s;tates of the &s;y&s;tem, as manife&s;ted chiefly by the pul&s;e. It is in con&s;equence of having ob&s;erved the evils which have re&s;ulted from the ignorance or neglect of this practice, that I have &s;ometimes wi&s;hed that it were po&s;&s;ible to aboli&s;h the &s;educing nomencla|ture of di&s;ea&s;es altogether, in order thereby to o|blige phy&s;icians to conform exactly to the fluctuating &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem in all their pre&s;criptions; for it is not more certain, that in all cultivated languages, every idea has its appropriate word, than that eve|ry &s;tate of a di&s;ea&s;e has its appropriate do&s;e of me|dicine, the knowledge and application of which, can alone con&s;titute rational, or en&s;ure uniformly, &s;ucce&s;sful practice.</P>
<P>I COME now to &s;ay a few words upon tho&s;e pal|liative remedies which are alike proper in every &s;pecies of the Pulmonary Con&s;umption.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Remedy under this head is a DRY SITUATION. A damp air, whether breathed in a room, or out of doors, is always hurtful in every &s;pecies of this di&s;order. A kitchen or a bed room below the level of the ground has often produced, and never fails to increa&s;e a pulmonary con&s;ump|tion. I have often ob&s;erved a peculiar palene&s;s,
<PB N="132" REF="026112_0136_0FCFF3A4AECD5E78">
(the fir&s;t &s;ymptom of general debility) to &s;hew it&s;elf very early in the faces of per&s;ons who work or &s;leep in cellar kitchens or &s;hops.</P>
<P N="2">2. COUNTRY AIR. The higher and dryer the &s;ituation which is cho&s;en for the purpo&s;e of enjoy|ing the benefit of this remedy, the better. Situa|tions expo&s;ed to the &s;ea, &s;hould be carefully avoid|ed; for it is a &s;ingular fact, that while con&s;umptive per&s;ons are benefited by the &s;ea air, when they breathe it on the ocean, they are always injured by that portion of it which they breathe on the &s;ea-&s;hore. I &s;hall not pau&s;e to inquire, why a mix|ture of land and &s;ea-air is &s;o hurtful in the con|&s;umption, and at the &s;ame time &s;o agreeable to per|&s;ons in health, and &s;o medicinal in many other di&s;|ea&s;es, but &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s this head by adding a fact which was communicated to me by Dr. Matthew Ir|vine of South-Carolina, and that is, That tho&s;e &s;itu|ations which are in the neighbourhood of Bays or Rivers, where the &s;alt and fre&s;h waters mix their &s;treams together, are more unfavourable to con|&s;umptive patients than the &s;ea-&s;hore; and therefore &s;hould be more carefully avoided by them in ex|changing city for country air.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="133" REF="026112_0137_0FCFF3A591DF6C98">3. LOOSE DRESSES, AND A CAREFUL ACCOMMO|DATION OF THEM TO THE CHANGES IN THE WEA|THER. Many facts might be mentioned to &s;hew the influence of compre&s;&s;ion and of tight ligatures of eve|ry kind, upon the different parts of the body; al&s;o of too much, or too little cloathing, in producing, or increa&s;ing di&s;ea&s;es of every kind, more e&s;pecially tho&s;e which affect the lungs. Tight &s;tays, garters, wai&s;tbands, and collars, &s;hould all be laid a&s;ide in the con&s;umption, and the quality of the cloathing &s;hould be &s;uited to the weather. A citizen of Maryland informed me, that he had twice had a return of a cough and &s;pitting of blood, by wearing his &s;um|mer cloaths a week after the weather became cool in the month of September. But it is not &s;ufficient to vary the weight or quality of dre&s;s with the &s;ea&s;ons. It &s;hould be varied with the changes which take place in the temperature of the air every day, even in the &s;ummer months, in middle latitudes. I know a citizen of Philadelphia, who has laboured under a con&s;umptive diathe&s;is near thirty years, who believes that he has le&s;&s;en|ed the frequency and violence of pulmonic com|plaints during that time, by a careful accommoda|tion of his dre&s;s to the weather. He has been ob&s;er|ved frequently to change his wai&s;tcoat and &s;hort cloaths twice or three times in a day, in a &s;ummer month.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="026112_0138_0FCFF3A81A5CB7E0">A REPETITION of colds, and thereby an increa&s;e of the di&s;order, will be prevented by wearing flan|nel next to the &s;kin in winter, and muffin in the &s;ummer, either in the form of a &s;hirt or a wai&s;t|coat: where the&s;e are objected to, a piece of flan|nel, or of &s;oft &s;heep&s;kin, &s;hould be worn next to the brea&s;t.

<P N="4">4. ARTIFICIAL EVACUATIONS by means of BLIS|TERS and ISSUES. I &s;u&s;pect the u&s;efulne&s;s of the&s;e re|medies to be chiefly confined to the inflammatory and hectic &s;pecies of con&s;umption. In the typhus &s;pe|cies, the &s;y&s;tem is too weak to &s;u&s;tain the di&s;charges of either of them. Fre&s;h bli&s;ters &s;hould be preferred to &s;uch as are perpetual, and the i&s;&s;ues, to be u&s;e|ful &s;hould be large.

<P N="5">5. CERTAIN FUMIGATIONS and VAPORS. An accidental cure of a pulmonary affection by the &s;moke of ro&s;in, in a man who bottled liquors, rai&s;ed for a while the credit of the fir&s;t of tho&s;e remedies. I have tried it, but without much permanent

effect. I think I have &s;een the pain in the brea&s;t relieved by receiving the vapor from a mixture of equal parts of tar, bran, and boiling water into the lungs. The &s;ulphureous and &s;aline air of Stabiae, between Mount Ve&s;uvius and the Mediterranean &s;ea, and the effluvia of the pine fore&s;ts of Lybia, were &s;uppo&s;ed in ancient times to be powerful re|medies in con&s;umptive complaints; but it is pro|bable, the exerci&s;e u&s;ed in travelling to tho&s;e coun|tries, contributed chiefly to the cures which were a&s;cribed to foreign matters acting upon the lungs.</P>

<P N="7">7. OPIATES. It is a mi&s;take in practice, found|ed upon a partial knowledge of the qualities of opium, to admini&s;ter it only at night, or to &s;uppo&s;e that its efforts in compo&s;ing a cough, depend upon its inducing &s;leep. It &s;hould be given in &s;mall do&s;es during the day, as well as in larger ones at night. The do&s;e &s;hould be proportioned to the degrees of action in the arterial &s;y&s;tem. The le&s;s this action, the more opium may be taken with &s;afety and advantage.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="136" REF="026112_0140_0FCFF3B3C64BD100">8. DIFFERENT POSITIONS OF THE BODY have been found to be more or le&s;s favourable to the abatement of the cough. The&s;e po&s;itions &s;hould be carefully &s;ought for, and the body kept in that which procures the mo&s;t freedom from coughing. I have heard of an in&s;tance, in which a cough which threatened a return of an hoemorrhage from the lungs, was perfectly compo&s;ed for two weeks, by keeping the patient nearly in one po&s;ture in bed; but I have known more ca&s;es in which relief from coughing was to be obtained only by an erect po&s;ture of the body.</P>
<P N="9">9. CONSIDERABLE relief will often be obtained from the patient's SLEEPING BETWEEN BLANKETS in winter, and on a MATRASS in &s;ummer. The former prevent fre&s;h colds from night &s;weats; the latter frequently checks them altogether. In ca&s;es, where a &s;ufficient weight of blankets, to keep up an agreeable warmth, cannot be borne without re&s;training ea&s;y and full acts of in&s;piration,&mdash;the patient &s;hould &s;leep under a light feather bed, or an eider down coverlit. They both afford more warmth than double or treble their weight of blankets.</P>
<P>HOWEVER comfortable this mode of producing warmth in bed may be it does not protect the

lungs from the morbid effects of the di&s;tant points of temperature of a warm parlour in the day time, and a cold bed-chamber at night. To produce an equable temperature of air at all hours, I have frequently advi&s;ed my patients, where going to a warm climate, was not practicable, to pa&s;s their nights as well as days in an open &s;tove room, in which nearly the &s;ame degrees of heat were kept up at all hours. I have found this practice, in &s;everal ca&s;es, a tolerable &s;ub&s;titute for a warm cli|mate.</P>
<P N="10">10. THE MODERATE u&s;e of the lungs, in READ|ING, PUBLIC SPEAKING, LAUGHING, and SING|ING. The lungs, when debilitated, derive equal benefit with the limbs, or other parts of the body, from moderate exerci&s;e. I have mentioned in an|other place <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>An account of the effects of common &s;alt in the care of hoemopty&s;is.</P><P><HI>Med. Inquiries and Ob&s;ervations.</HI></P></NOTE> &s;everal facts which &s;upport this opi|nion. But too much pains cannot be taken to in|culcate upon our patients, to avoid all <HI>exce&s;s</HI> in the u&s;e of the lungs, by <HI>long,</HI> or <HI>loud</HI> reading&mdash;&s;peak|ing&mdash;or &s;inging&mdash;or by &s;udden and violent <HI>bur&s;ts</HI> of laughter. I &s;hall long lament the death of a female patient, who had di&s;covered many hopeful &s;igns of a recovery from a con&s;umption, who
<PB N="138" REF="026112_0142_0FCFF3B91B1ACFF0">
relap&s;ed, and died in con&s;equence of bur&s;ting a blood-ve&s;&s;el in her lungs, by a &s;udden fit of laugh|ter.</P>
<P N="11">11. ARE there any advantages to be derived from the excitement of certain PASSIONS in the treatment of con&s;umptions? Dr. Blane tells us, that many con&s;umptive per&s;ons were relieved, and that &s;ome recovered, in con&s;equence of the terror which was excited by a hurricane in Barbadoes, in the year 1780. It will be difficult to imitate, by artificial means, the accidental cures which are recorded by Dr. Blane; but we learn enough from them to in&s;pire the invigorating pa&s;&s;ions of hope and confidence in the minds of our patients, and to recommend to them &s;uch exerci&s;es as pro|duce exertions of body and mind analogous to tho&s;e which are produced by terror. Van Swieten and Smollet relate cures of con&s;umptions, by pa|tients falling into &s;treams of cold water. Perhaps in both in&s;tances, the cures were performed only by the fright and con&s;equent exertion produced by the fall. This is only one in&s;tance out of many which might be mentioned, of partial and unequal action being &s;uddenly changed into general and equal excitement in every part of the &s;y&s;tem. The cures of con&s;umptions which have been performed
<PB N="139" REF="026112_0143_0FCFF3BAA50F7128">
by a camp life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Medical Inquiries and Ob&s;ervations.</NOTE>, have probably been much a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the commotions in the pa&s;&s;ions which were ex|cited by the various and changing events of war.</P>
<P>BEFORE I proceed to &s;peak of the radical cure of the con&s;umption, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that by means of the palliative remedies which have been mentioned, many per&s;ons have been re|covered, and &s;ome have had their lives prolonged by them for many years. In all the&s;e ca&s;es I have found, upon inquiry, that the di&s;order was attend|ed with but little general debility, and that it fre|quently recurred as &s;oon as the patient left off the u&s;e of his remedies, unle&s;s it were prevented by ne|ce&s;&s;ary or voluntary exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>IT is truly &s;urpri&s;ing to ob&s;erve how long &s;ome per&s;ons have lived, who have been affected by a con&s;umptive diathe&s;is, and by frequent attacks of many of the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome &s;ymptoms of this di&s;order. Van Swieten mentions the ca&s;e of a man, who had lived thirty years in this &s;tate. Mor|ton relates the hi&s;tory of a man, in whom the &s;ymptoms of con&s;umption appeared with but little variation or abatement from his early youth till the 70th year of his age; and Bennet &s;ays, he
<PB N="140" REF="026112_0144_0FCFF3BCB3E9F290">
knew an in&s;tance of this di&s;order which continued &s;ixty years. I pre&s;cribed for one of my pupils four and twenty years ago, in a con&s;umption, who, du|ring the greate&s;t part of the time that has clap&s;ed &s;ince, has &s;eldom pa&s;&s;ed a year without &s;pitting blood, nor a week without coughing, who now en|joys a tolerable &s;hare of health. In this ca&s;e, the fatal tendency of the di&s;order was con&s;tantly op|po&s;ed by rural exerci&s;es, by a cordial, but tempe|rate diet, and (during the ab&s;ence of inflammatory action in his pul&s;e) by the occa&s;ional u&s;e of Peru|vian bark.</P>
<P>I AM led here to mention another in&s;tance of the analogy between pneumony and the pulmonary con&s;umption. We often &s;ee the &s;ame frequency of recurrence of both di&s;orders in habits which are predi&s;po&s;ed to them. I have attended a Ger|man citizen of Philadelphia, in &s;everal fits of the pneumony, who has been confined to his bed eight and twenty times, by the &s;ame di&s;order, in the cour&s;e of the &s;ame number of years. He has, for the mo&s;t part, enjoyed good health in the inter|vals of tho&s;e attacks, and always appeared, till lately, to po&s;&s;e&s;s a good con&s;titution. In the ca&s;es of the frequent recurrence of pneumony, no one has &s;u&s;pected the di&s;ea&s;e to have originated in a morbid &s;tate of the lungs; on the contrary, it ap|pears
<PB N="141" REF="026112_0145_0FCFF3BFE113D988">
evidently to be produced by the <HI>&s;udden</HI> in|fluence of the &s;ame cau&s;es, which by acting with le&s;s force, and for a <HI>longer</HI> time, produce the pulmona|ry con&s;umption. The name of pneumony is taken from the principal &s;ymptom of this di&s;order, but it is as certainly a di&s;ea&s;e of the whole arterial &s;y&s;|tem as the con&s;umption; and I add further, that it is as certainly produced by general predi&s;po&s;ing debility. The hardne&s;s and fulne&s;s of the pul&s;e do not militate again&s;t this a&s;&s;ertion, for they are al|together the effects of a morbid and convul&s;ive ex|citement of the &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem. The &s;trength manife&s;ted by the pul&s;e is moreover partial, for every other part of the body di&s;covers, at the &s;ame time, &s;igns of extreme debility.</P>
<P>IT would be ea&s;y, by pur&s;uing this &s;ubject a lit|tle further, to mention a number of facts which, by the aid of principles in phy&s;iology and pathology, which are univer&s;ally admitted, would open to us a new theory of fevers, but this would lead us too far from the &s;ubject before us. I &s;hall only re|mark, that all that has been &s;aid of the influence of <HI>general</HI> debilitating cau&s;es upon the lungs, both in pnuemony and con&s;umption, and of the alternation of the con&s;umption with other general di&s;ea&s;es, will receive great &s;upport from con&s;idering the lungs only as a part of the whole external &s;urface of the
<PB N="142" REF="026112_0146_0FCFF3C157B6C918">
body, upon which mo&s;t of the remote and exciting cau&s;es of both di&s;ea&s;es produce their fir&s;t effects. This extent of the &s;urface of the body, not only to the lungs, but to the alimentary canal, was fir&s;t taken notice of by Dr. Boerhaave; but was unhappily neglected by him in his theories of the di&s;ea&s;es of the lungs and bowels. Dr. Keil &s;uppo&s;es, that the lungs, from the peculiar &s;tructure of the bronchial ve&s;&s;els, and air ve&s;icles, expo&s;e a &s;urface to the action of the air, equal to the extent of the whole external and vi&s;ible &s;urface of the body.</P>
<P>THUS have I mentioned the u&s;ual palliative re|medies for the con&s;umption. Many of the&s;e re|medies have, under certain circum&s;tances, been &s;aid to have cured the di&s;ea&s;e, but I &s;u&s;pect that &s;uch cures have taken place only when the di&s;or|der has partaken of an intermediate nature be|tween a pnuemony and a true pulmonary con&s;ump|tion. Such connecting &s;hades appear between the extreme points of many other di&s;ea&s;es. In a for|mer e&s;&s;ay,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inquiry into the di&s;ea&s;es and remedies of the Indians of North America; and a comparative view of their di&s;ea|&s;es and remedies with tho&s;e of civilized nations. P. 43.</NOTE> I endeavoured to account for the tran&s;|mutation (if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion) of the pneumony into the con&s;umption, by a&s;cribing
<PB N="143" REF="026112_0147_0FCFF3C2E53694B0">
it to the increa&s;e of the debilitating refinements of civilized life. This opinion has derived con&s;tant &s;upport from every ob&s;ervation I have made con|nected with this &s;ubject, &s;ince its fir&s;t publication, in the year 1772.</P>
<P>I COME now to treat of the RADICAL REMEDIES for the pulmonary con&s;umption.</P>
<P>In an e&s;&s;ay formerly alluded to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thoughts upon the pulmonary con&s;umption. Med. Inq. and Ob&s;ervations.</NOTE>, I mentioned the effects of labour, and the hard&s;hips of a camp or naval life, upon this di&s;order. As there mu&s;t fre|quently occur &s;uch objections to each of tho&s;e re|medies, as to forbid their being recommended or adopted, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;eek for &s;ub&s;titutes for them in the different &s;pecies of exerci&s;e. The&s;e are, <HI>active, pa&s;&s;ive,</HI> and <HI>mixed.</HI> The <HI>active,</HI> in|cludes walking, and the exerci&s;e of the hands and feet in working or dancing. The <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> includes rocking in a cradle, &s;winging, &s;ailing, and riding in carriages of different kinds. The <HI>mixed</HI> is con|fined chiefly to riding on hor&s;e-back.</P>
<P>I HAVE mentioned all the different &s;pecies of ex|erci&s;e, not becau&s;e I think they all belong to the
<PB N="144" REF="026112_0148_0FCFF3C44D8263A8">
cla&s;s of radical remedies for the con&s;umption, but becau&s;e it is often nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e tho&s;e which are pa&s;&s;ive, before we recommend tho&s;e of a mixed or active nature. That phy&s;ician does not err more who advi&s;es a patient to take phy&s;ic, without &s;peci|fying its qualities and do&s;es, than the phy&s;ician does who advi&s;es a patient, in a con&s;umption, to u&s;e ex|erci&s;e, without &s;pecifying its &s;pecies and degrees. From the neglect of this direction, we often find con&s;umptive patients injured in&s;tead of being reliev|ed by exerci&s;es, which, if u&s;ed with judgment, might have been attended with the happie&s;t ef|fects.</P>
<P>I HAVE before &s;ugge&s;ted that the &s;timulus of every medicine, which is intended to excite action in the &s;y&s;tem, &s;hould always be in an exact ratio to its excitability. The &s;ame rule &s;hould be applied to the &s;timulus of exerci&s;e. I have heard a well atte&s;ted ca&s;e of a young lady, upon who&s;e con&s;ump|tion the fir&s;t &s;alutary impre&s;&s;ion was made by rocking her in a cradle; and I know another ca&s;e in which a young lady, in the lowe&s;t &s;tate of that debility which precedes an affection of the lungs, was prepared for the u&s;e of the mixed and active exerci&s;es, by being fir&s;t moved gently back|wards and forwards in a chariot without hor&s;es, for an hour every day. Swinging appears to act
<PB N="145" REF="026112_0149_0FCF4953D9D3E870">
in the &s;ame gentle manner. In the ca&s;e of a gar|diner, who was far advanced in a con&s;umption, in the Penn&s;ylvania ho&s;pital, I had the plea&s;ure of ob&s;erving its good effects, in an eminent degree. It &s;o far re&s;tored him, as to enable him to complete his recovery by working at his former occupa|tion.</P>
<P>IN ca&s;es of extreme debility, the following or|der &s;hould be recommended in the u&s;e of the dif|ferent &s;pecies of exerci&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. Rocking in a cradle, or riding on an ela&s;tic board&mdash;commonly called a chamber hor&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. Swinging.</P>
<P N="3">3. Sailing.</P>
<P N="4">4. Riding in a carriage.</P>
<P N="5">5. Riding on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P N="6">6. Walking.</P>
<P N="7">7. Running&mdash;Dancing, &amp;c.</P>
<P>IN the u&s;e of each of tho&s;e &s;pecies of exerci&s;e great attention &s;hould be paid to the <HI>degree</HI> or <HI>force</HI> of action with which they are applied to the body.
<PB N="146" REF="026112_0150_0FCFF3C9974D7058">
For example,&mdash;in riding in a carriage, the exerci&s;e will be le&s;s in a four-wheel carriage than in a &s;ingle hor&s;e chair, and le&s;s when the hor&s;es move in a walking, than a trotting gait. In riding on hor&s;e|back, the exerci&s;e will be le&s;s or greater according as the hor&s;e walks, paces, canters, or trots, in pa&s;|&s;ing over the ground.</P>
<P>I HAVE good rea&s;on to believe, that an Engli&s;h &s;ea captain, who was on the verge of the grave with the con&s;umption, in the &s;pring of the year 1790, owed his perfect recovery to nothing but the above gradual manner, in which, by my advice, he made u&s;e of the exerci&s;es of riding in a carriage and on hor&s;eback. I have &s;een many other ca&s;es of the good effects of thus accommodating exer|ci&s;e to debility; and I am &s;orry to add, that I have &s;een many ca&s;es in which from the neglect of this manner of u&s;ing exerci&s;e, mo&s;t of the &s;pecies and degrees of it, have either been u&s;ele&s;s, or done harm. However carele&s;sly this ob&s;ervation may be read by phy&s;icians, or attended to by patients, I conceive to direction to be more nece&s;&s;ary in the cure of con&s;umptions. I have been thus particular in detailing it, not only becau&s;e I believe it to be important, but that I might atone to &s;ociety for that portion of evil which I might have prevented
<PB N="147" REF="026112_0151_0FCFF3CC308FF220">
by a more &s;trict attention to it in the fir&s;t years of my practice.</P>
<P>THE more the arms are u&s;ed in exerci&s;e the better. One of the proprietary governors of Penn|&s;ylvania, who laboured for many years under a con|&s;umptive diathe&s;is, derived great benefit from fre|quently rowing him&s;elf in a &s;mall boat, a few miles up and down the river Schuilkill. Two young men, who were predi&s;po&s;ed to a con&s;umption, were per|fectly cured by working &s;teadily at a printing pre&s;s in this city. Perhaps the &s;uperior advantages of riding on hor&s;eback, in this di&s;order, may ari&s;e in part from the con&s;tant and gentle u&s;e of the arms in the management of the bridle and the whip.</P>
<P>MUCH has been &s;aid in favour of &s;ea voyages in con&s;umptions. In the mild degrees of the di&s;|order they certainly have done &s;ervice,&mdash;but I &s;u&s;|pect the relief given, or the cures performed by them, &s;hould be confined chiefly to &s;eafaring people, who add to the benefits of a con&s;tant change of pure air, a &s;hare of the invigorating exerci&s;es of navigating the &s;hip. I have frequently heard of con&s;umptive patients reviving at &s;ea, probably from the tran&s;ient effects of &s;ea &s;ickne&s;s upon the whole &s;y&s;tem, and growing wor&s;e as &s;oon as they
<PB N="148" REF="026112_0152_0FCFF3CF8D5289A8">
came near the end of their voyage. It would &s;eem as if the mixture of land and &s;ea airs was hurtful to the lungs in every &s;ituation and condition in which it could be applied to them. Nor is this peculiar and morbid operation of land and &s;ea airs upon the human body confined only to con&s;ump|tive people. I cro&s;&s;ed the Atlantic ocean in the year 1766, with a &s;ea captain, who announced to his pa&s;&s;engers the agreeable news that we were near the Briti&s;h coa&s;t before any di&s;covery had been made of our &s;ituation by &s;ounding, or by a change in the colour of the water. Upon a&s;king him upon what he founded his opinion,&mdash;he &s;aid, that he had been &s;neezing, which he added, was the &s;ign of an approaching cold, and that in the cour&s;e of upwards of twenty years, he had never made the land (to u&s;e the &s;eaman's phra&s;e) with|out being affected in a &s;imilar manner. I have vi&s;ited many &s;ick people in Philadelphia &s;oon after their arrival from &s;ea, who have informed me, that they had enjoyed good health during the greate&s;t part of their voyage, and that they had contracted their indi&s;po&s;itions after they came within &s;ight of the land. I mention the&s;e facts only to &s;hew the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of advi&s;ing con&s;umptive patients, who under|take a &s;ea voyage for the recovery of their health, not to expo&s;e them&s;elves upon deck in the morn|ing and at night, after they arrive within the re|gion
<PB N="149" REF="026112_0153_0FCFF3D86D6C8270">
in which the mixture of the land and &s;ea airs may be &s;uppo&s;ed to take place.</P>
<P>I SUBSCRIBE, from what I have ob&s;erved, to the bold declaration of Dr. Sydenham, in favor of the efficacy of <HI>riding on hor&s;eback,</HI> in the cure of con&s;umption. I do not think the exi&s;tence of ul|cers, or even tubercles in the lungs, when recent, or of a moderate &s;ize, the lea&s;t objection to the u&s;e of this excellent remedy. Ulcers in the lungs are not nece&s;&s;arily fatal, and tubercles have no ma|lignity in them which &s;hould render their removal impracticable by this &s;pecies of exerci&s;e. The fir&s;t que&s;tion, therefore, to be a&s;ked by a phy&s;ician who vi&s;its a patient in this di&s;order &s;hould be, not, what is the &s;tate of his lungs, but, is he able to ride on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>THERE are two methods of riding for health in this di&s;order. The fir&s;t is by &s;hort excur&s;ions; the &s;econd is, by long journies. In &s;light con|&s;umptive affections, and after a recovery from an acute illne&s;s, &s;hort excur&s;ions are &s;ufficient to re|move the exi&s;ting debility; but in the more advan|ced &s;tages of con&s;umption, they are &s;eldom effec|tual, and frequently do harm by exciting an occa|&s;ional appetite without adding to the dige&s;tive powers. They moreover keep the &s;y&s;tem con|&s;tantly
<PB N="150" REF="026112_0154_0FCFF3DB84607FA8">
vibrating by their unavoidable incon&s;tancy, between di&s;tant points of tone and debility<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The bad effects of <HI>incon&s;tant</HI> exerci&s;e have been taken notice of in the goat.

<P>IN a con&s;umption of long continuance or of great danger, long journies on hor&s;e back are the the mo&s;t effectual modes of exerci&s;e. They afford a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of fre&s;h objects and company, which divert the mind from dwelling upon the dan|ger of the exi&s;ting malady; they are moreover at|tended by a con&s;tant change of air, and they are not liable to be interrupted by company, or tran&s;i|ent changes in the weather, by which means ap|petite and dige&s;tion, action and power all keep pace with each other. It is to be lamented that the u&s;e of this excellent remedy is frequently op|po&s;ed by indolence and narrow circum&s;tances in both &s;exes, and by the peculiarity of &s;ituation and temper in the female &s;ex. Women are attached to their families by &s;tronger ties than men. They cannot travel alone. Their delicacy, which is in|crea&s;ed
<PB N="151" REF="026112_0155_0FCFF3DC5276E9D8">
by &s;ickne&s;s, is liable to be offended at every &s;tage,&mdash;and la&s;tly, they &s;ooner relax in their ex|ertions to prolong their lives than men. Of the truth of the la&s;t ob&s;ervation, Sir William Hamil|ton has furni&s;hed us with a &s;triking illu&s;tration. He tells us, that in digging into the rums pro|duced by the late earthquake in Calabria, the wo|men who peri&s;hed in it, were all found with their arms folded as if they had abandoned them&s;elves immediately to de&s;pair and death; whereas, the men were found with their arms extended, as if they had re&s;i&s;ted their fate to the la&s;t moment of their lives. It would &s;eem from this fact, and ma|ny others of a &s;imilar nature which might be rela|ted; that a capacity of bearing pain and di&s;tre&s;s with fortitude and re&s;ignation, was the di&s;tingui&s;h|ing characteri&s;tic of the female mind; while a di&s;|po&s;ition to re&s;i&s;t and overcome evil belonged in a more peculiar manner to the mind of man. I have mentioned this peculiarity of circum&s;tances and temper in female patients, only &s;o the &s;ake of convincing phy&s;icians that it will be nece&s;&s;ary for them to add all the force of eloquence to their ad|vice, when they recommend journies to women in preference to all other remedies, for the recovery of their health.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="026112_0156_0FCF495768C3F190">PERSONS, moreover, who pur&s;ue active employ|ments, frequently object to undertaking journies, from an opinion that their daily occupations are &s;ufficient to produce all the &s;alutary effects we expect from artificial exerci&s;e. It will be highly nece&s;&s;ary to correct this mi&s;take, by a&s;&s;uring &s;uch per&s;ons that, however u&s;eful the habitual exerci&s;e of an active, or even a laborious employment may be to <HI>pre&s;erve</HI> health, it mu&s;t always be exchanged for one which excites new impre&s;&s;ions, both upon the mind and body in every attempt to <HI>re&s;tore</HI> the &s;y&s;tem from that debility which is connected with pulmonary con&s;umption.</P>
<P>AS travelling is often rendered u&s;ele&s;s, and even hurtful in this di&s;ea&s;e from being pur&s;ued in an im|proper manner, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to furni&s;h our patients with &s;uch directions as will enable them to derive the greate&s;t benefit from their journies. I &s;hall therefore, in this place, mention the &s;ub|&s;tance of the directions which I have given in wri|ting for many years to &s;uch con&s;umptive patients as undertake journies by my advice.</P>
<P N="1">1. TO <HI>Avoid Fatigue.</HI> Too much cannot be &s;aid to enforce this direction. It is the hinge on which the recovery or death of a con&s;umptive pa|tient frequently turns. I repeat it again, there|fore,
<PB N="153" REF="026112_0157_0FCF49A2D98FABB0">
that patients &s;hould be charged over and over when they &s;et off on a journey, as well as when they u&s;e exerci&s;e of any kind to avoid fa|tigue. For this purpo&s;e, they &s;hould begin by travelling only a few miles in a day, and increa&s;e the di&s;tance of their &s;tages as they increa&s;e their &s;trength. By neglecting this practice, many per|&s;ons have returned from journies much wor&s;e than when they left home, and many have died in ta|verns, or at the hou&s;es of their friends on the road. Travelling in &s;tage-coaches is &s;eldom &s;afe for a con&s;umptive patient. They are often crouded; they give too much motion; and they afford by their &s;hort delays and di&s;tant &s;tages, too little time for re&s;t, or for taking the frequent refre&s;hment which was formerly recommended.</P>
<P N="2">2. TO <HI>Avoid travelling too &s;oon in the Morning,</HI> and after the <HI>Going down of the Sun in the Even|ing</HI>; and if the weather be hot, never to travel in the middle of the day. The &s;ooner a patient breakfa&s;ts after he leaves his bed the better; and in no ca&s;e &s;hould he leave his morning &s;tage with an empty &s;tomach.</P>
<P N="3">3. IF it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for a patient to lie down, or to &s;leep in the day time, he &s;hould be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to <HI>undre&s;s</HI> him&s;elf, and to cover his body
<PB N="154" REF="026112_0158_0FCFF3DED24D6108">
between &s;heets or blankets. The u&s;ual ligatures of garters, &s;tocks, kneebands, wai&s;tcoats and &s;hoes, are very unfriendly to &s;ound &s;leep; hence per&s;ons who lie down with their cloaths on, often awake from an afternoon's nap in terror from dreams, or in a profu&s;e &s;weat, or with a head-ach or &s;ick &s;tomach; and generally out of humor. The &s;urveyors are &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the truth of this remark, that they always undre&s;s them&s;elves when they &s;leep in the woods. An intelligent gentleman of this profe&s;&s;ion informed me that he had fre|quently &s;een young wood&s;men who had refu&s;ed to conform to this practice, &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed in the morning, that after the experience of a few nights, they were forced to adopt it.</P>
<P>GREAT care &s;hould be taken in &s;leeping, whe|ther in the day time, or at night, never to lie down in damp &s;heets. Dr. Sydenham excepts the dan|ger from this quarter, when he &s;peaks of the ef|ficacy of riding on hor&s;eback in curing the con|&s;umption.</P>
<P N="4">4. PATIENTS who travel for health in this di&s;|order &s;hould avoid all <HI>large companies,</HI> more e&s;peci|ally <HI>evening</HI> and <HI>night parties.</HI> The air of a contaminated room, phlogi&s;ticated by the breath of fifteen or twenty per&s;ons, and by the &s;ame number
<PB N="155" REF="026112_0159_0FCFF3E0ACBF5A50">
of burning candles, is poi&s;on to a con&s;umptive pa|tient. To avoid impure air from every other &s;ource, he &s;hould likewi&s;e avoid &s;leeping in a croud|ed room, or with curtains around his bed, and even with a bed-fellow.</P>
<P N="5">5. TRAVELLING, to be effectual in this di&s;or|order, &s;hould be conducted in &s;uch a manner as that a patient may e&s;cape the <HI>extremes</HI> of <HI>heat</HI> and <HI>cold.</HI> For this purpo&s;e he &s;hould pa&s;s the winter, and part of the &s;pring in Georgia or South-Carolina, and the &s;ummer in New Hamp|&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, or Vermont, or if he plea&s;es, he may &s;till more effectually &s;hun the &s;ummer heats by cro&s;&s;ing the lakes, and travelling along the &s;hores of the St. Lawrence to the city of Quebec. He will thus e&s;cape the extremes of heat and cold, particularly the le&s;s avoidable one of heat; for I have con&s;tantly found the hot month of July to be as unfriendly to con&s;umptive patients in Penn&s;ylvania, as the variable month of March. By the&s;e means too he will enjoy nearly an equable temperature of air in every month of the year; and his &s;y&s;tem will be free from the inconvenience of the alternate ac|tion of heat and cold upon it. The autumnal months &s;hould be &s;pent in New-Jer&s;ey or Penn&s;yl|vania.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="026112_0160_0FCFF3E284685F48">IN the&s;e journies from north to &s;outh, or from &s;outh to north, he &s;hould be careful, for rea&s;ons before mentioned, to keep at as great a di&s;tance as po&s;&s;ible from the &s;ea coa&s;t. Should this inquiry fall into the hands of a Briti&s;h phy&s;ician, I would beg leave to &s;ugge&s;t to him, whether more advantages would not acrue to his con&s;umptive patients from advi&s;ing them to cro&s;s the Atlantic ocean, and afterwards to pur&s;ue the tour which I have recommended, than by &s;ending them to Portugal, France, or Italy&mdash;Here they will arrive with &s;uch a mitigation of the vi|olence of the di&s;order, in con&s;equence of the length of their &s;ea voyage, as will enable them immediately to begin their journies on hor&s;eback. Here they will be expo&s;ed to fewer temptations to intemperance, or to unhealthy a|mu&s;ements, than in old European countries. And, la&s;tly, in the whole cour&s;e of this tour, they will travel among a people related to them by a &s;ame|ne&s;s of language and manners, and by ancient or modern ties of citizen&s;hip. Long journies for the recovery of health under circum&s;tances &s;o agreeable, &s;hould certainly be preferred to travel|ling among &s;trangers of different nations, langua|ges, and manners on the continent of Europe.</P>
<P N="6">6. TO render travelling on hor&s;eback effectual in a con&s;umption, it &s;hould be continued with mo|derate
<PB N="157" REF="026112_0161_0FCFF3E3CFD5FC50">
intervals from <HI>&s;ix to twelve months.</HI> But the cure &s;hould not be re&s;ted upon a &s;ingle journey. It &s;hould be repeated every <HI>two</HI> or <HI>three years,</HI> till our patient has pa&s;&s;ed the con&s;umptive &s;tages of life. Nay,&mdash;he mu&s;t do more, he mu&s;t acquire a <HI>habit</HI> of riding con&s;tantly, both at home and abroad, or to u&s;e the words of Dr. Fuller "he mu&s;t, like a Tartar, learn to live on hor&s;eback, by which means he will acquire in time the con&s;titu|tion of a Tartar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Medicina Gymna&s;tica, p. 116.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>WHERE benefit is expected from a change of climate, as well as from travelling, patients &s;hould re&s;ide at lea&s;t two years in the place which is cho&s;en for that purpo&s;e. I have &s;eldom known a re&s;idence for a &s;horter time in a foreign climate do much &s;ervice.</P>
<P>TO &s;ecure a perfect obedience to medical advice, it would be extremely u&s;eful if con&s;umptive pa|tients could always be acompanied by a phy&s;ician. Cel&s;us &s;ays, he found it more ea&s;y to cure the drop&s;y in &s;laves than in freemen, becau&s;e they more readily &s;ubmitted to the re&s;traints he im|po&s;ed upon their appetites. Madne&s;s has become a curable di&s;order in England, &s;ince the phy&s;icians of that country have opened private mad-hou&s;es,
<PB N="158" REF="026112_0162_0FCFF3E55D454558">
and have taken the entire and con&s;tant direction of their patients into their own hands. The &s;ame &s;ucce&s;sful practice would probably follow the treatment of con&s;umptions, if patients were con|&s;tantly kept under the eye and authority of their phy&s;icians.&mdash;The keenne&s;s of appetite, and great &s;tock of animal &s;pirits, which tho&s;e per&s;ons frequently po&s;&s;e&s;s, hurry them into many exce&s;&s;es which defeat the be&s;t concerted plans of a re|covery;&mdash;or, if they e&s;cape the&s;e irregularities, they are frequently &s;educed from our direc|tions by every quack remedy which is recom|mended to them. Unfortunately the cough be|comes a &s;ignal of their di&s;order, at every &s;tage of their journey, and the ea&s;y or plea&s;ant pre&s;criptions of even ho&s;tlers and ferrymen, are often &s;ub&s;tituted to the &s;elf-denial and exertion which have been im|po&s;ed by phy&s;icians. The love of life in the&s;e ca&s;es &s;eems to level all capacities; for I have ob|&s;erved per&s;ons of the mo&s;t cultivated under&s;tand|ings to yield in common with the vulgar to the u&s;e of the&s;e pre&s;criptions.</P>
<P>I CANNOT conclude this inquiry without ad|ding, that the author of it derived from his pa|ternal ance&s;tors a predi&s;po&s;ition to the pulmonary con&s;umption, and that between the 18th and 43d years of his age, he has occa&s;ionally been afflicted
<PB N="159" REF="026112_0163_0FCFF3E7E90776B8">
with many of the &s;ymptoms of that di&s;order which he has de&s;cribed:&mdash;By the con&s;tant and faithful u&s;e of mo&s;t of the remedies which he has recommended, he has enjoyed for &s;everal years nearly an uninter|rupted exemption from pulmonary complaints. In humble gratitude, therefore, to that BEING, who conde&s;cends to be called the pre&s;erver of men, he thus publicly devotes the re&s;ult of his experience and inquiries to the benefit of &s;uch of his fellow crea|tures as may be afflicted with the &s;ame di&s;order, &s;incerely wi&s;hing that they may be as u&s;eful to them, as they have been to the author.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHETHER we admit the exhaling and ab&s;orbing ve&s;&s;els to be affected in gene|ral drop&s;ies by preternatural debility&mdash;pal&s;y&mdash;or rupture, or by a retrograde motion of their fluids, it is certain that their exhaling and ab&s;orbing pow|er is materially affected by too much, or too little action in the arterial &s;y&s;tem. That too little action in the arteries &s;hould favour drop&s;ical effu&s;ions, has been long ob&s;erved, but it has been le&s;s obvi|ous that the &s;ame effu&s;ions are &s;ometimes promo|ted, and their ab&s;orption prevented, by too much action in the&s;e ve&s;&s;els. That this fact &s;hould have e&s;caped our notice, is the more remarkable, con&s;i|dering how long we have been accu&s;tomed to &s;ee|ing &s;erous &s;wellings in the joints in the acute
<PB N="164" REF="026112_0166_0FCFF3EC2E1272E8">
rheumati&s;m, and copious, but partial effu&s;ions of water in the form of &s;weat, in every &s;pecies of in|flammatory fever.</P>
<P>IT is nothing new that the healthy action of one part, &s;hould depend upon the healthy action of another part of the &s;y&s;tem. We &s;ee it in many of the di&s;ea&s;es of the nerves and brain. The tetanus is cured by exciting a tone in the arterial &s;y&s;tem; madne&s;s is cured by le&s;&s;ening the action of the ar|teries by copious bloodletting, and epilep&s;y and hy&s;teria are often mitigated by the moderate u&s;e of the &s;ame remedy.</P>
<P>BY too much action in the arterial &s;y&s;tem, I mean a certain morbid excitement in the arteries, accompanied by preternatural force, which is ob|vious to the &s;en&s;e of touch. It differs from the morbid excitement of the arteries, which takes place in inflammatory fevers, in being of a le&s;s ir|regular or convul&s;ive nature, and in being attended by le&s;s febrile heat, and with little or no pain in the head or limbs. The thir&s;t is nearly the &s;ame in this &s;pecies of drop&s;y, as in inflammatory fevers. I include here tho&s;e drop&s;ies only in which the whole &s;y&s;tem is affected by what is called an hy|dropic diathe&s;is.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="026112_0167_0FCFF3EDAD2B2028">THAT debility &s;hould, under certain circum&s;tan|ces, di&s;po&s;e to exce&s;&s;ive action, and that exce&s;&s;ive action &s;hould occur in one part of the body, at the &s;ame time that debility prevailed in every other, are abundantly evident from the hi&s;tory and phae|nomena of many di&s;ea&s;es. Inflammatory fever, ac|tive haemorrhages, tonic gout, a&s;thma, apoplexy, and pal&s;y, however much they are accompanied by exce&s;&s;ive action in the arterial &s;y&s;tem, are al|ways preceded by original debility, and are always accompanied by obvious debility in every other part of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>BUT it has been le&s;s ob&s;erved by phy&s;icians that an undue force or exce&s;s of action occurs in the arterial &s;y&s;tem in certain drop&s;ies, and that the &s;ame theory which explains the union of predi&s;po|&s;ing and nearly general debility, with a partial ex|citement and preternatural action in the arterial &s;y&s;tem, in the di&s;ea&s;es before mentioned, will ex|plain the &s;ymptoms and cure of certain drop&s;ies.</P>
<P>THAT debility predi&s;po&s;es to every &s;pecies of drop&s;y, is evident from the hi&s;tory of all the re|mote and occa&s;ional cau&s;es which produce them.

body. It is too plain to be denied. I &s;hall only mention the &s;ymptoms which indicate a morbid ex|citement and preternatural action in the arterial &s;y|&s;tem. The&s;e are</P>
<P N="1">1. A <HI>hard, full,</HI> and quick pul&s;e. This &s;ymptom I believe, is more common in drop&s;ies than is ge|nerally &s;uppo&s;ed, for many phy&s;icians vi&s;it and ex|examine patients in the&s;e di&s;orders, without feel|ing the pul&s;e. Dr. Home mentions the <HI>frequency</HI> of the pul&s;e, in the patients who&s;e cures he has re|corded,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Medical Facts.</NOTE> but he takes no notice of its force except in two ca&s;es. Dr. Zimmerman, in his account of the drop&s;y which terminated the life of the late king of Pru&s;&s;ia, tells us that he found his pul&s;e <HI>hard</HI> and <HI>full.</HI> I have repeatedly found it full and hard in every &s;pecies of drop&s;y, and more e&s;pe|cially in the fir&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;order. Indeed I have &s;eldom found it otherwi&s;e in the beginning of the drop&s;y of the brea&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. SIZY BLOOD. This has been taken notice of by many practical writers, and has very ju&s;tly been a&s;cribed under certain circum&s;tances of bloodlet|ting, to an exce&s;&s;ive action of the ve&s;&s;els upon the blood.</P>

<P N="6">6. THE <HI>appearance of drop&s;ies in the winter and &s;pring, in habits previou&s;ly affected by the in|termitting fever.</HI> The debility produced by this &s;pecies of fever, frequently di&s;po&s;es to inflammatory diathe&s;is, as &s;oon as the body is expo&s;ed to the al|ternate action of heat and cold, nor is this inflam|matory diathe&s;is always laid a&s;ide, by the tran&s;ition of the intermitting fever into a drop&s;y, in the &s;uc|ceeding cold weather.</P>
<P N="7">7. THE <HI>injurious effects of &s;timulating medicines in certain drop&s;ies,</HI> prove that there exi&s;ts in them,
<PB N="168" REF="026112_0170_0FCFF3F399E9AAC0">
at times, too much action in the blood ve&s;&s;els. Dr. Ti&s;&s;ot, in a letter to Dr. Haller, <Q>De Vario|lis, apoplexia, et hydrope,</Q> condemns in &s;trong terms, the u&s;e of opium in the drop&s;y. Now the bad effects of this medicine in drop&s;ies, mu&s;t have ari&s;en from its having been given in ca&s;es of too much action in the arterial &s;y&s;tem; for opium, we know, increa&s;es, by its &s;timulating qualities, the action and tone of the blood ve&s;&s;els, and hence we find, it has been pre&s;cribed with &s;ucce&s;s in drop|&s;ies of too little action in the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>BUT the exi&s;tence of too much action in the arterial &s;y&s;tem in certain drop&s;ies, will appear more fully from the hi&s;tory of the effects of the remedies which have been employed either by de&s;ign or ac|cident in the cure of the&s;e di&s;orders. I &s;hall fir&s;t mention the remedies which have been u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s in tonic drop&s;ies; and afterwards mention tho&s;e which have been given with &s;ucce&s;s in drop|&s;ies of a contrary &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem. I have con|&s;tantly purpo&s;ed to treat only of the theory and cure of drop&s;ies in general, without &s;pecifying any of the numerous names it derives from the differ|ent parts of the body in which they may be &s;eated; but in &s;peaking of the remedies which have been u&s;ed with advantage in both the tonic and atonic &s;pecies, I &s;hall occa&s;ionally mention the name

or &s;eat of the drop&s;y in which the remedy has done &s;ervice.</P>
<P>THE I&s;t. Remedy that I &s;hall mention for drop|&s;ies is <HI>Blood Letting.</HI> Dr. Hoffman and Dr. Home both cured drop&s;ies accompanied by pulmonic con|ge&s;tion by means of this remedy. Dr. Monroe quotes a ca&s;e of drop&s;y from Sponius, in which bleeding &s;uceeeded, but not till after it had been u&s;ed twenty times<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Treati&s;e on the Drop&s;y.</NOTE>. Mr. Cruik&s;hank relates a ca&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Treati&s;e on the Lymphatics.</NOTE> of accidental bleeding, which confirms the ef|ficacy of blood-letting in the&s;e di&s;orders. He tells us that he attended a patient with drop&s;ical &s;wellings in his legs, who had had a hoar&s;ene&s;s for two years. One morning in &s;tooping to buckle his &s;hoes, he bur&s;ted a blood-ve&s;&s;el in his lungs, from which he lo&s;t a quart of blood; in con&s;e|quence of which, both the &s;wellings and the hoar&s;e|ne&s;s went off gradually, and he continued well two years afterwards. I have known one ca&s;e in which &s;pontaneous haemorrhages from the haemorrhoidal ve&s;&s;els, and from the no&s;e, &s;uddenly reduced uni|ver&s;al drop&s;ical &s;wellings. In this patient there had been an uncommon ten&s;ion and fullne&s;s in the pul&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="026112_0172_0FCFF3F8D36C84D8">TO the&s;e facts, I can with plea&s;ure add, that I have cured one per&s;on of a&s;cites, and three of ana&s;arca, (in the cour&s;e of the three la&s;t years) by means of blood-letting. It has been u&s;ed with equal &s;ucce&s;s by Dr. Rawlings, of Mary|land, in a ca&s;e of ana&s;arca which had re&s;i&s;ted nitre, and other powerful medicines commonly pre|&s;cribed for that di&s;order.</P>
<P>IN tho&s;e deplorable ca&s;es of Hydrothorax, which do not admit of a radical cure, I have given temporary relief, and thereby protracted life by taking away occa&s;ionally a few ounces of blood.&mdash; Had Dr. Zimmerman u&s;ed this remedy in the ca&s;e of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, I cannot help thinking from the account which the Doctor gives us of the diet, and pul&s;e of his royal patient, that he would have le&s;&s;ened his &s;ufferings much more than by plentiful do&s;es of dandelyon; for I take it for granted, from the candor and integrity which the Doctor di&s;covered in all his vi&s;its to the king, that he did not expect that dandelyon, or any other medicine would cure him.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH a <HI>full</HI> and <HI>ten&s;e</HI> pul&s;e is always an indication of the nece&s;&s;ity of bleeding; yet I can ea&s;ily conceive there may be &s;uch conge&s;tions, and &s;uch a degree of &s;timulus to the arterial &s;y&s;tem,
<PB N="171" REF="026112_0173_0FCFF3FC06DD7628">
as to produce indirect debility, and a <HI>low</HI> or <HI>weak</HI> pul&s;e. Two ca&s;es of this kind are related by Dr. Monroe, one of which was cured by bleeding. The &s;ame &s;ymptom of a low and weak pul&s;e is often met with in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;tage of pneumony, and apoplexy, and is only to be removed by the plen|tiful u&s;e of the &s;ame remedy.</P>
<P N="2">II. VOMITS have often been given with advan|tage in drop&s;ies. Dr. Home &s;ays, that &s;quills were u&s;eful in the&s;e di&s;orders only when they pro|duced a vomiting. The ultimate action of vomits is certainly debilitating; but in producing a dimi|nution of excitement and action in the arterial &s;y&s;|tem, they di&s;po&s;e the lymphatics to ab&s;orb and di&s;charge large quantities of water.&mdash;The ef|ficacy of vomits in promoting the ab&s;orption of &s;tagnating fluids is not confined to drop&s;ies. Mr. Hunter was once called to vi&s;it a patient in whom he found a bubo in &s;uch a &s;tate that he purpo&s;ed to open it the next day. In the mean while, the pa|tient went on board of a ve&s;&s;el where he was &s;e|verely affected by &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s and vomiting; in con&s;equence of which the bubo di&s;appeared, and the patient recovered without the u&s;e of the knife.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="026112_0174_0FCFF3FD8AE590E8">MR. CRUIKSHANK further mentions a ca&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter to Mr. Clare, p. 16<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> of a &s;welling in the knee being nearly cured by a pa|tient vomiting eight and forty hours in con&s;equence of his taking a large do&s;e of the &s;alt of tartar in|&s;tead of &s;oluble tartar.</P>
<P N="3">III. PURGES. The efficacy of this remedy in the cure of drop&s;ies, has been acknowledged by phy&s;icians in all ages and countries. Jalap, calo|mel, &s;cammony and gamboge, are often preferred for this purpo&s;e; but I have heard of two ca&s;es of a&s;cites being cured by a table &s;poonful of &s;weet oil taken every day. It probably acted only as a gentle laxative. The cream of tartar &s;o highly commended by Dr. Home, &s;eems to act <HI>chiefly</HI> in the &s;ame way. Gherlius, from whom Dr. Home learned the u&s;e of this medicine, &s;ays, that all the per&s;ons whom he cured by it were in the vigor of life, and that their di&s;ea&s;es had been only of a few months continuance. From the&s;e two circum|&s;tances, it is mo&s;t probable they were drop&s;ies of exce&s;&s;ive action in the arterial &s;y&s;tem. He adds further that the per&s;ons who were cured by this medicine, were reduced very low by the u&s;e of it. Dr. Home &s;ays that it produced the &s;ame effect upon the patients whom he cured by it, in the In|firmary
<PB N="173" REF="026112_0175_0FCF495F31BCA698">
of Edinburgh. Dr. Sydenham prefers gentle to dra&s;tic purges, and recommends the exhi|bition of them every day. Both dra&s;tic and gentle purges act by dimini&s;hing the action of the arterial &s;y&s;tem, and thereby promote the ab&s;orption and di&s;charge of water. That purges promote ab|&s;orption, we learn not only from their effects in drop&s;ies, but from an experiment related by Mr. Cruik&s;hank<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter to Mr. Clare, p. 117.</NOTE>, of a man who acquired &s;everal ounces of weight after the operation of a purge. The ab&s;orption in this ca&s;e was from the atmo|&s;phere. So great is the effect of purges in pro|moting ab&s;ortion, that Mr. Hunter &s;uppo&s;es the matter of a gonorrhoea, or of topical venereal ul|cers to be conveyed by them in &s;ome in&s;tances into every part of the body.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>Certain Medicines,</HI> which by le&s;&s;ening the <HI>action of the arterial &s;y&s;tem,</HI> favour the ab&s;orption and evacuation of water. The only medicines of this cla&s;s which I &s;hall name are <HI>nitre, cream of tartar,</HI> and <HI>foxglove.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. TWO ounces of nitre di&s;&s;olved in a pint of water, and a wine-gla&s;s full of it taken three times a-day have performed perfect cures, in two ca&s;es of a&s;cites, which have come under my notice. I
<PB N="174" REF="026112_0176_0FCFF401137523E0">
think I have cured two per&s;ons of ana&s;arca, by giv|ing one &s;cruple of the &s;ame medicine three times a-day for &s;everal weeks. The two la&s;t cures were evidently drop&s;ies of too much action in the arte|rial &s;y&s;tem. Where nitre has been given in ato|nic drop&s;ies it has generally been u&s;ele&s;s, and &s;ome|times done harm. I have &s;een one in&s;tance of an incurable diarrhoea after tapping, which I &s;u&s;pected aro&s;e from the de&s;truction of the tone of the &s;tomach and bowels, by large and long continued do&s;es of nitre, which the patient had previou&s;ly taken by the advice of a per&s;on who had been cured by that re|remedy. To avoid this, or any other inconveni|ence from the u&s;e of nitre in drop&s;ies, it &s;hould be given at fir&s;t in &s;mall do&s;es, and &s;hould always be laid a&s;ide, if it &s;hould prove ineffectual after having been given two or three weeks.</P>
<P N="2">2. I CAN &s;ay nothing of the efficacy of cream of tartar in drop&s;ies from my own experience, where it has not acted as a purge. Perhaps my want of deci&s;ion upon this &s;ubject has ari&s;en only from my not having per&s;i&s;ted in the u&s;e of it for the &s;ame length of time which is mentioned by Dr. Home.</P>
<P N="3">3. THERE has been much inquiry into the manner in which foxglove acts in curing drop&s;ies. It has been &s;uppo&s;ed to exert a &s;pecific action on
<PB N="175" REF="026112_0177_0FCFF408436239E8">
the kidneys as a diuretic; but I am rather di&s;po&s;ed to believe, that it acts only by le&s;&s;ening the action of the arterial &s;y&s;tem by a &s;edative quality which ap|pears to re&s;ide in it. I am led to adopt this opi|nion by the facts which are related by Dr. Darwin, who &s;ays, that he had &s;een it do &s;ervice in the drop&s;y, without producing any immediate dicharge of water, and that it &s;eldom &s;ucceeded until it had previou&s;ly debilitated the body.</P>
<P>DR. WARREN &s;ays, that he &s;eldom found tonics nece&s;&s;ary after he had di&s;charged the water in the drop&s;y by this medicine, probably becau&s;e he re|duced the arterial &s;y&s;tem by it, from an exce&s;&s;ive to a healthy &s;tate of action. And even Dr. Withering, who &s;uppo&s;es the foxglove to be im|proper in plethoric habits, confe&s;&s;es that tonics, after its u&s;e "very often deceived his expecta|tions," probably by reproducing the &s;ame morbid and exce&s;&s;ive action in the arterial &s;y&s;tem, which he had ju&s;t before removed by means of the fox|glove. I am the more di&s;po&s;ed to adopt this opi|nion of the manner in which this medicine acts, from ob&s;erving the good effects which are a&s;cribed to it in vertigo&mdash;madne&s;s&mdash;hoemorrhages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ferria<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>&mdash;and pulmonary con&s;umption, when the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are
<PB N="176" REF="026112_0178_0FCFF40B0F8FDF18">
accompanied by too much action in the arterial &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>THERE are different opinions concerning the efficacy of this medicine in drop&s;ies. From the the ca&s;es related by Dr. Withering, it appears to have done good; but from tho&s;e related by Dr. Lett&s;om<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Medical Memoirs, vol. II.</NOTE> it &s;eems to have done harm. I &s;u&s;pect the different accounts of tho&s;e two gentlemen have ari&s;en from their having given it in different &s;tates of the &s;y&s;tem. In drop&s;ies of too much action, I believe it has &s;ometimes been u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s, but in atonic drop&s;ies, I am &s;atisfied that it is not only an u&s;ele&s;s but a dangerous medicine. I am &s;orry to add further, that after many trials of this me|dicine I have failed in mo&s;t of the ca&s;es in which I have given it. I have di&s;charged the water in three in&s;tances by it, but the di&s;ea&s;e returned, and my patients finally died.&mdash;I can a&s;cribe only one com|plete cure to its u&s;e which was in the year 1789, in a young man in the Penn&s;ylvania ho&s;pital, of five and thirty years of age, of a robu&s;t habit, and plethoric pul&s;e.</P>
<P>WHERE medicines have once been in u&s;e, and afterwards fall into di&s;repute, as was the ca&s;e with
<PB N="177" REF="026112_0179_0FCFF40D95BD0488">
the Foxglove, I &s;u&s;pect the ca&s;es in which they were u&s;eful, to have been either few or doubtful, and that the ca&s;es in which they had done harm, were &s;o much more numerous and unequivocal, as ju&s;tly to bani&s;h them from the materia medica.</P>
<P N="5">V. HARD LABOR, or exerci&s;e in &s;uch a degree as to produce fatigue, have in &s;everal in&s;tances cured the drop&s;y. A di&s;pen&s;ary patient in this city was cured of this di&s;order by &s;awing wood, And a patient in an a&s;cites under my care in the Penn&s;ylvania ho&s;pital, had his belly reduced &s;even inches in circumference in one day, by the labor of carrying wood from the yard into the ho&s;pital. A &s;econd patient belonging to the Penn&s;ylvania Di&s;pen&s;ary was cured by walking to Lanca&s;ter, 66 miles from the city, in the middle of winter. The efficacy of travelling in this di&s;order in cold weather, is taken notice of by Dr. Monroe, who quotes a ca&s;e from Dr. Haller, of a French mer|chant, who was cured of a drop&s;y by a journey from Paris to England, in the winter &s;ea&s;on. It would &s;eem, that in the&s;e two ca&s;es, the <HI>cold</HI> co|operated as a &s;edative with the fatigue produced by labor or exerci&s;e, in reducing the tone of the arterial &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="178" REF="026112_0180_0FCFF40EF9CB2E68">VI. LOW DIET. I have heard of a woman who was cured of a drop&s;y by eating nothing but boiled beans for three weeks, and drinking no|thing but the water in which they had been boiled. Many other ca&s;es of the good effects of low diet in drop&s;ies are to be found on the records of medicine.</P>
<P N="7">VII. THIRST. This cruel remedy acts by de|bilitating the &s;y&s;tem in two ways; 1&s;t, By ab&s;tract|ing the &s;timulus of di&s;tention; and, 2dly, By pre|venting a fre&s;h &s;upply of water to replace that which is di&s;charged by the ordinary emunctories of nature.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. FASTING. An accidental circum&s;tance related by Sir John Hawkins, in the life of Dr. John&s;on, fir&s;t led me to ob&s;erve the good ef|fects of fa&s;ting in the drop&s;y. If the fact alluded to &s;tood alone under the pre&s;ent head of this e&s;&s;ay, it would be &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h the exi&s;tence of too much action, and the efficacy of debilitating remedies in certain drop&s;ies. I am the more di&s;|po&s;ed to lay a good deal of &s;tre&s;s upon this fact, as it was the clue which conducted me out of the la|byrinth of empirical practice, in which I had been bewildered for many years, and finally led me to adopt the principles and practice which I am now endeavoring to e&s;tabli&s;h. The pa&s;&s;age which con|tains
<PB N="179" REF="026112_0181_0FCFF416C8733928">
this intere&s;ting fact is as follows. <Q>A few days after (&s;ays Sir John) he [meaning Dr. John|&s;on] &s;ent for me, and informed me, that he had di&s;covered in him&s;elf the &s;ymptoms of a drop&s;y, and indeed, his very much increa&s;ed bulk, and the &s;wollen appearance of his legs, &s;eemed to indicate no le&s;s. It was on Thur&s;day that I had this conver&s;ation with him, in the cour&s;e thereof, he declared that he intended to devote the whole of the next day to <HI>fa&s;ting,</HI> humilia|tion, and &s;uch other devotional exerci&s;es as be|came a man in his &s;ituation. On the Saturday following I made him a vi&s;it, and upon entering his room, I ob&s;erved in his countenance &s;uch a &s;erenity as indicated, that &s;ome remarkable cri&s;is of his di&s;order had produced a change in his feelings. He told me, that pur&s;uant to the re&s;o|lution he had mentioned to me, he had &s;pent the preceding day in an ab&s;traction from all worldly concerns&mdash;that to prevent interruption he had in the morning ordered <HI>Frank,</HI> [his &s;ervant] not to admit any one to him, and the better to enforce the charge, had added the&s;e awful words, <HI>for your ma&s;ter is preparing him&s;elf to die.</HI> He then men|tioned to me, that in the cour&s;e of this exer|ci&s;e he found him&s;elf relieved from the di&s;order which had been growing upon him, and was becoming very oppre&s;&s;ive, viz. the <HI>drop&s;y,</HI> by
<PB N="180" REF="026112_0182_0FCFF41A1D92E470">
the gradual evacuation of water, to the amount of <HI>twenty pints,</HI> a like in&s;tance whereof he had never before experienced.</Q> Sir John Hawkins a&s;cribes this immen&s;e di&s;charge of water to the influence of Dr. John&s;on's prayers; but he neglects to take notice, that the&s;e prayers were an&s;wered in this in&s;tance, us they are in many others, in a perfect con&s;i&s;tence with the com|mon and e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of nature.</P>
<P>TO &s;atisfy my&s;elf that this di&s;charge of water, in the ca&s;e of Dr. John&s;on, was produced by the fa&s;ting only, I recommended it &s;oon after I read the above account to a gentlewoman whom I was then attending in an a&s;cites. I was delighted with the effects of it. Her urine, which for &s;ome time be|fore had not exceeded half a pint a-day, amounted to <HI>two quarts</HI> on the day &s;he fa&s;ted. I repeated the &s;ame pre&s;cription once a week for &s;everal weeks, and each time was informed of an increa&s;e of urine, though it was con&s;iderably le&s;s in the la&s;t experiments than in the fir&s;t. Two patients in an a&s;cites, to whom I pre&s;cribed the &s;ame remedy, in the Penn&s;ylvania Ho&s;pital, the one in the winter of 1790, and the other in the winter of 1792, ex|hibited proofs in the pre&s;ence of many of the &s;tudents of the univer&s;ity, equally &s;atisfactory of
<PB N="181" REF="026112_0183_0FCFF41DF2C9A9C8">
the efficacy of fa&s;ting in &s;uddenly increa&s;ing the quantity of urine.</P>
<P N="9">IX. FEAR. This pa&s;&s;ion is evidently of a de|bilitating nature, and therefore, it has frequently afforded an accidental aid in the cure of drop&s;ies, of too much action. I &s;u&s;pect, that the fear of death, which was &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hing a part of the character of Dr. Jonh&s;on, added a good deal to the efficacy of fa&s;ting, in procuring the immen&s;e di&s;charge of water beforementioned. In &s;upport of the efficacy of fear &s;imply applied, in di&s;charging water from the body in drop&s;ies, I &s;hall mention the following facts.</P>
<P>IN a letter which I received from Dr. John Pennington, dated Edinburgh, Augu&s;t 3. 1790, I was favoured with the following communication. <Q>Since the conver&s;ation I had with you on the &s;ub|ject of the drop&s;y, I feel more and more inclined to adopt your opinion. I can furni&s;h you with a fact which I learned from a Dani&s;h &s;ailor, on my pa&s;&s;age to this country, which is much in fa|vor of your doctrine. A &s;ailor in an a&s;cites, fell off the end of the yard into the &s;ea; the wea|ther being calm, he was taken up unhurt, but to u&s;e the &s;ailor's own words, who told me the &s;tory, he was <HI>frightened half to death,</HI> and as
<PB N="182" REF="026112_0184_0FCFF41F98D7E4D0">
&s;oon as he was taken out of the water, he di&s;|charged a gallon of urine or more. A doctor on board a&s;cribed this large evacuation to &s;ea bath|ing, and accordingly ordered the man to be dipped in the &s;ea every morning, much again&s;t his will, for my informant adds, that he had not forgotten his fall, and that in four weeks he was perfectly well. I think this fact can only be explained on your principles. The &s;edative operation of <HI>fear,</HI> was no doubt the cau&s;e of his cure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is an account of an a&s;cites being cured by a fall from an open chai&s;e recorded in the third volume of the me|dical Memoirs by Mr. Lowdell. I have heard of a com|plete recovery from crop&s;y, having &s;uddenly followed a fall from a hor&s;e. In both the&s;e ca&s;es may not fear have contri|buted very much to the cures?</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>DR. HALL, of York-town in Penn&s;ylvania, in|formed me, that he had been called to vi&s;it a young woman of 19 years of age, who had taken all the u&s;ual remedies for a&s;cites without effect. He at once propo&s;ed to her the operation of tapping. To this &s;he objected, but &s;o great was the <HI>fear</HI> of this operation, which the propo&s;al of it &s;uddenly excited in her mind, that it brought on a plentiful di&s;charge of urine, which in a few days perfectly removed her di&s;order.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="026112_0185_0FCFF42153448A78">On the 27th of Augu&s;t, 1790, I vi&s;ited a gentle|woman in this city with the late Dr. Jones, in an a&s;cites. We told her for the fir&s;t time, that &s;he could not be relieved without being tapped. She appeared to be much terrified upon hearing our opinion, and &s;aid that &s;he would con&s;ider of it. I &s;aw her two days afterwards, when &s;he told me with a &s;mile on her countenance, that &s;he hoped &s;he &s;hould get well without tapping, for that &s;he had di&s;charged two quarts of water in the cour&s;e of the day after we had advi&s;ed her to &s;ubmit to that operation. For many days before, &s;he had not di&s;charged more than two or three gills in twenty-four hours. The operation, notwith|&s;tanding, was &s;till indicated, and &s;he &s;ubmitted to be tapped a few days afterwards.</P>
<P>I TAPPED the &s;ame gentlewoman a &s;econd time in January 1791- She was much terrified while I was preparing for the operation, and fainted im|mediately after the puncture was made. The &s;e|cond time that I vi&s;ited her after the operation was performed, &s;he told me (without being interro|gated on that &s;ubject) that &s;he had di&s;charged a pint and an half of urine, within twenty minutes after I left the room on the day I tapped her. What made this di&s;charge the more remarkable
<PB N="184" REF="026112_0186_0FCFF4276BB09DB8">
was, &s;he had not made more than a table &s;poonful of water in a day for &s;everal days before &s;he was tapped.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;een &s;imilar di&s;charges of urine in two other ca&s;es of tapping which have come under my notice, but they re&s;embled &s;o nearly tho&s;e which have been mentioned, that it will be unnece&s;&s;ary to record them.</P>
<P>BUT the influence of fear upon the &s;y&s;tem in the drop&s;y, extends far beyond the effects which I have a&s;cribed to it. Dr. Currie, of this city, informed me that he called about four years ago, by appointment to tap a woman. He no &s;ooner entered the room than he ob&s;erved her, as he thought, to faint away. He attempted to re|cover her, but to no purpo&s;e. She died of a &s;ud|den paroxy&s;m of fear.</P>
<P>IT is a matter of &s;urpri&s;e, that we &s;hould have remained &s;o long ignorant of the influence of fear upon the urinary organs in drop&s;ies, after having been &s;o long familiar with the &s;ame effect of that pa&s;&s;ion in the hy&s;teria.</P>
<P>IN recommending the antiphlogi&s;tic treat|ment of certain drop&s;ies, I mu&s;t here confine my|&s;elf to the drop&s;ies of &s;uch climates as di&s;po&s;e to

di&s;ea&s;es of too much action in the &s;y&s;tem.

Dr. Stoll tells us, that in the month of January, 1780, <Q>Hydropic and a&s;thmatic patients di&s;cover|ed more or le&s;s marks of inflammatory diathe&s;is, and that blood was drawn from them with a &s;pa|ring hand with advantage;</Q> and in the month of November of the &s;ame year, he &s;ays, <Q>The &s;tronger diuretics injured drop&s;ical patients in this &s;ea&s;on; but an antiphlogi&s;tic drink, compo|&s;ed of a quart of the decoction of gra&s;s, with two ounces of &s;imple oxymel, and nitre and cream of tartar of each a drachm did &s;ervice.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">o Medend. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">.

gradual addition of water from numerous &s;treams, and which continue for days and weeks together to exhibit marks of violence in every part of their cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I COME now to &s;ay a few words upon Atonic Drop&s;ies. They may ea&s;ily be di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e which have been de&s;cribed, by occurring in habits naturally weak; by being produced by the operation of chronic cau&s;es; by a weak and quick pul&s;e, and by little or no preternatural heat or thir&s;t.</P>
<P>THE Remedies for Atonic Drop&s;ies are all &s;uch &s;timulating &s;ub&s;tances as increa&s;e the action of the arterial &s;y&s;tem, or determine the fluids to the uri|nary organs. The&s;e are,</P>

<P N="3"><PB N="187" REF="026112_0189_0FCFF42F99FEB190">III. OPIUM. The efficacy of this medicine in drop&s;ies has been atte&s;ted by Dr. Willis, and &s;e|veral other practical writers. It &s;eems to po&s;&s;e&s;s almo&s;t an exclu&s;ive power of acting alike upon the arterial, the lymphatic, the glandular, and the ner|vous &s;y&s;tems.</P>
<P N="4">IV. METALLIC TONICS, &s;uch as chalybeate medicines of all kinds, and the mild preparations of copper and mercury. I once cured an incipi|ent a&s;cites and ana&s;arca by large do&s;es of the ru&s;t of iron; and I have cured many drop&s;ies by giv|ing mercury in &s;uch quantities as to excite a plen|tiful &s;alivation. I have, it is true, often given it without effect, probably from my former ignorance of the tonic action of the arteries, which &s;o fre|quently occurs in drop&s;ies, and in which ca&s;es, mer|cury mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have done harm.</P>
<P N="5">V. DIURETICS, con&s;i&s;ting of alkaline &s;aits, ni|tre, and the oxymels of &s;quills and colchicum. It is difficult to determine how far the&s;e medicines produce their &s;alutary effects by acting directly up|on the kidneys. It is remarkable that the&s;e organs are &s;eldom affected in drop&s;ies, and that their di&s;|ea&s;es are rarely followed by drop&s;ical effu&s;ions in any part of the body.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="188" REF="026112_0190_0FCF4961C84654F8">VI. GENEROUS DIET, con&s;i&s;ting of animal food, rendered cordial by &s;pices; al&s;o &s;ound old wine.</P>
<P N="7">VII. DILUTING DRINKS taken in &s;uch large quantites as to excite the action of the ve&s;&s;els by the &s;timulus of di&s;ten&s;ion. This effect has been produced, Sir George Baker informs us, by means of large draughts of &s;imple water, and of cyder and water<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The remark upon this fact by Sir George, is worthy of notice, and implies much more than was probably intend|ed by it. <Q>When common means have failed, &s;ucce&s;s has &s;ometimes followed a method <HI>directly contrary</HI> to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed practice.</Q>&mdash;&mdash;Medical Tran&s;actions, Vol. II.</NOTE>. The influence of di&s;tention in promoting ab&s;orption is evident in the urinary and gall blad|ders, which frequently return their contents to the blood by the lymphatics, when they are unable to di&s;charge them through their u&s;ual emunctories. Is it not probable that the di&s;tention produced by the large quantities of liquids which we are direct|ed to admini&s;ter after giving the foxglove, may have been the means of performing &s;ome of tho&s;e cures of drop&s;ies, which have been a&s;cribed to that re|medy?</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="189" REF="026112_0191_0FCFF431D9FE0D80">VIII. PRESSURE. Bandages bound tightly a|round the belly and limbs, &s;ometimes prevent the increa&s;e or return of drop&s;ical &s;wellings. The in|fluence of pre&s;&s;ure upon the action of the lympha|tics appears in the ab&s;orption of bone which fre|quently follows the pre&s;&s;ure of contiguous tumors, al&s;o in the ab&s;orption of fle&s;h which follows the long pre&s;&s;ure of certain parts of the body upon a &s;ick bed.</P>
<P N="9">IX. FRICTIONS, either by means of a dry, or oiled hand, or with linen or flannel impregnated with volatile and other &s;timulating &s;ub&s;tances. I have found evident advantages from following the advice of Dr. Cullen, by rubbing the lower extre|mities <HI>upwards,</HI> and that only in the <HI>morning.</HI>&mdash; I have been at a lo&s;s to account for the manner in which &s;weet oil acts when applied to drop&s;ical &s;wel|lings. If it act by a &s;edative power upon the blood-ve&s;&s;els, it will be more proper in tonic than atonic drop&s;ies; but if it act by clo&s;ing the pores, and thereby preventing the ab&s;orption of moi&s;ture from the air, it will be very proper in the &s;pecies of drop|&s;y which is now under con&s;ideration. It is in this manner that Dr. Cullen &s;uppo&s;es that &s;weet oil, when applied to the body, cures that &s;pecies of diabetes in which nothing but in&s;ipid water is di&s;|charged from the bladder.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="190" REF="026112_0192_0FCFF437E9058A88">X. HEAT applied either &s;eparately or combined with moi&s;ture in the form of warm or vapor baths, has often been u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s in drop&s;ies of too little action. Dampier in his voyage round the world was cured of a drop&s;y by means of a copi|ous &s;weat excited by burying him&s;elf in a bed of warm &s;and. Warm fomentations to the legs ren|dered moderately &s;timulating by the addition of &s;a|line or aromatic &s;ub&s;tances, have often done &s;ervice in the atonic drop&s;ical &s;wellings of the lower ex|tremities.</P>
<P N="11">XI. THE COLD-BATH. I can &s;ay nothing in favor of the efficacy of this remedy in drop&s;ies, from my own experience. Its good effects &s;eem to depend wholly on its encrea&s;ing the excitability of the &s;y&s;tem to common &s;timuli, by the diminution of its excitement. If this be the ca&s;e, I would a&s;k, whether FEAR might not be employed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, and thus become as u&s;eful in atonic, as it was formerly proved to be in tonic drop&s;ies.</P>
<P N="12">XII. WOUNDS, whether excited by cutting in|&s;truments, or by fire, provided they excite inflam|mation, and action in the arteries, frequently cure atonic drop&s;ies. The good effects of inflammation, and action in the&s;e ca&s;es appear in the cure of hy|drocele by means of the needle, or the cau&s;tic.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="026112_0193_0FCFF43F77AAFA00">XIII. EXERCISE. This is probably as nece&s;&s;a|ry in the atonic drop&s;y, as it is in the con&s;umption, and &s;hould never be omitted when a patient is able to take it. The pa&s;&s;ive exerci&s;es of &s;winging, and riding in a carriage are mo&s;t proper in the lowe&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;order; but as &s;oon as the patient's &s;trength will admit of it, he &s;hould ride en hor&s;e|back. A journey &s;hould be preferred in this di&s;|order, to &s;hort excur&s;ions from home.</P>
<P>IN the application of each of the remedies which has been mentioned for the cure of both tonic and atonic Drop&s;ies, great care &s;hould be taken to u&s;e them in &s;uch a manner, as to accommodate them to the &s;trength and excitability of the patient's &s;y&s;tem. The mo&s;t powerful remedies have often been ren|dered <HI>hurtful</HI> by being given in too large do&s;es in the beginning; and <HI>u&s;ele&s;s</HI> by being given in too &s;mall do&s;es, in the &s;ub&s;equent &s;tages of the di&s;or|der.</P>
<P>I HAVE avoided &s;aying any thing of the u&s;ual o|perations for di&s;charging water from different parts of the body, as my de&s;ign was to treat only of the &s;ymptoms and cure of tho&s;e drop&s;ies which affect the whole &s;y&s;tem. I &s;hall only remark, that if tap|ing and punctures have been more &s;ucce&s;sful in the early, than in the late &s;tage of the&s;e di&s;orders,
<PB N="192" REF="026112_0194_0FCFF245D1499920">
it is probably becau&s;e the &s;udden or gradual eva|cuation of water takes down that exce&s;&s;ive action in the arterial &s;y&s;tem, which is mo&s;t common in their early &s;tage, and thereby favours the &s;peedy re&s;toration of healthy action in the exhaling or lymphatic ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>THUS have I endeavoured to prove, that two di&s;tinct and oppo&s;ite &s;tates of action take place in drop&s;ies, and have mentioned the remedies which are proper for each of them under &s;eparate heads. But I &s;u&s;pect that drop&s;ies are often connected with a certain intermediate or mixed action in the arterial &s;y&s;tem analogous to the typhoid action which takes place in certain fevers. I am led to adopt this opinion, not only from having ob&s;erved mixed action to be &s;o univer&s;al in mo&s;t of the di&s;ea|&s;es of the arterial and nervous &s;y&s;tem, but becau&s;e I have &s;o frequently ob&s;erved drop&s;ical &s;wellings to follow the &s;carlatina, and the puerperile &s;ever, two di&s;ea&s;es which appear to derive their peculiar cha|racter from a mixture of exce&s;s and deficiency of <HI>force,</HI> combined with irregularity of action in the arterial <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. In drop&s;ic, of mixed action where too much force prevails in the action of &s;ome, and too little in the action of other of the arterial fibres, the remedies mu&s;t be debilitating or &s;timulating,
<PB N="193" REF="026112_0195_0FCFF2475045D520">
according to the greater or le&s;s predominance of to|nic or atonic diathe&s;is in the arterial &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this hi&s;tory of drop&s;ies, and of the different and oppo&s;ite remedies which have cured them, by the follewing ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>WE learn, in the fir&s;t place, from what has been &s;aid, the impropriety and even danger of pre&s;cri|bing &s;timulating medicines indi&s;criminately in every ca&s;e of drop&s;y.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE are taught by the facts which have been mentioned, the rea&s;on why phy&s;icians have differ|ed &s;o much in their accounts of the &s;ame remedies, and why the &s;ame remedies have operated &s;o dif|ferently in the hands of the &s;ame phy&s;icians. It is becau&s;e they have been given without a refer|ence to the two different &s;tates of the &s;y&s;tem, which have been de&s;cribed. Dr. Sydenham &s;ays, that he cured the fir&s;t drop&s;ical patient he was call|ed to, by frequent purges. He began to exult in the di&s;covery, as he thought, of a certain cure for drop&s;ies, but his triumph was of &s;hort duration. The &s;ame remedy failed in the next ca&s;e in which he pre&s;cribed it. The rea&s;on probably was, the drop&s;y in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, was of a tonic, but in the &s;e|cond, of an atonic nature; for the latter was an a&s;cites from a quartan ague. It is agreeable, how|ever, to di&s;cover, from the theory of drop&s;ies which has been laid down, that all the different remedies
<PB N="194" REF="026112_0196_0FCFF24CD86F9D80">
for the&s;e di&s;orders have been proper in their na|ture, and improper only in the &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem in which they have been given. As the di&s;covery of truth in religion reconciles the principles of the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite &s;ects; &s;o the di&s;covery of truth in medicine, reconciles the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite modes of practice. It would be happy if the inquirers after truth in medicine &s;hould be taught by &s;uch di&s;cove|ries, to treat each other with tenderne&s;s and re&s;pect, and to wait with patience till accident, or time, &s;hall combine into one perfect and con&s;i&s;tent &s;y&s;tem, all the contradictory facts and opinions about which phy&s;icians have been &s;o long divided.</P>
<P N="3">3. IF a &s;tate of exce&s;&s;ive action in the arteries has been demon&s;trated in drop&s;ies, both from its &s;ymp|toms and remedies, and if the&s;e drop&s;ies are evi|dently produced by previous debility, who will de|ny the exi&s;tence of exce&s;&s;ive action in certain hae|morrhages, in gout, pal&s;y, apoplexy, and madne&s;s, notwith&s;tanding they are all the offspring of pre|di&s;po&s;ing debility? And who will deny the effi|cacy of bleeding, purges, and other debilitating medicines in certain &s;tates of tho&s;e di&s;orders, that has &s;een the &s;ame medicines admini&s;tered with &s;uc|ce&s;s in certain drop&s;ies? To reject bleeding, pur|ging, and the other remedies for exce&s;&s;ive action in the &s;y&s;tem, in either of the above di&s;ea&s;es, be|cau&s;e that action was preceded by general debility,
<PB N="195" REF="026112_0197_0FCFF251D38B2898">
will lead us to reject them in the mo&s;t acute inflam|matory fevers, for the&s;e are as much the offspring of previous debility as drop&s;ies or pal&s;y. The previous debility of the former, differs from that of the latter di&s;ea&s;es, only in being of a more ac|cute, or, in other words, of a &s;horter duration.</P>
<P N="4">4. FROM the &s;ymptoms of tonic drop&s;y which have been mentioned, it follows, that the di&s;tinc|tion of apoplexy into &s;erous and &s;anguineous, af|fords no rational indication for a difference in the mode of treating that di&s;order. If an effu&s;ion of &s;erum in the thorax, bowels, or limbs, produce a hard and full pul&s;e, it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;ame &s;ymptom will be produced by the effu&s;ion of &s;erum in the brain. But the di&s;&s;ections collect|ed by Lieutaud,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;toria Anatomico Medica. Vol. ii.</NOTE> place this opinion beyond all controver&s;y. They prove that the &s;ymptoms of too much, and too little action, as they appear in the pul&s;e, follow alike the effu&s;ion of &s;erum and blood in the brain. This fact will admit of an important application to the di&s;ea&s;e, which is to be the &s;ubject of the next inquiry.</P>
<P N="5">5. FROM the influence which has been de&s;cri|bed, of the different &s;tates of action of the arterial &s;y&s;tem, upon the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els, in drop&s;ies, we are led to reject the indi&s;criminate u&s;e of bark,
<PB N="196" REF="026112_0198_0FCFF25357A58338">
mercury, and &s;alt water, in the &s;crophula. When the action of the arteries is weak, tho&s;e remedies are proper; but when an oppo&s;ite &s;tate of the ar|terial &s;y&s;tem occurs, and above all, when &s;cro|phulous tumours are attended with inflammatory ulcers, &s;timulating medicines of all kinds are hurt|ful. By alternating the above remedies with a milk and vegetable diet, according to the tonic, or atonic &s;tates of the arterial &s;y&s;tem, I have lately &s;ucceeded in a ca&s;e of &s;crophula, attended by large ulcers in the inguinal glands, which had for &s;everal years re&s;i&s;ted the con&s;tant u&s;e of the three &s;timulating remedies which have been mention|ed.</P>
<P N="6">6. NOTWITHSTANDING I have &s;uppo&s;ed drop|&s;ies to be connected with a peculiar &s;tate of force in the blood ve&s;&s;els, yet I have not ventured to a&s;&s;ert, that drop&s;ies may not exi&s;t from an exclu|&s;ive affection of the exhaling and ab&s;orbing ve&s;&s;els. I conceive this to be as po&s;&s;ible, as for a fever to exi&s;t from an exclu&s;ive affection of the arteries, or an hy&s;teria, from an exclu&s;ive affection of the nervous &s;y&s;tem. Nothing, however, can be &s;aid upon this &s;ub|ject, until phy&s;iology and pathology have taught us more of the &s;tructure and di&s;ea&s;es of the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els. Nor have I ventured further to a&s;&s;ert, that there are not medicines which may act &s;pecifically upon the lymphatics independently of the arteries.
<PB N="197" REF="026112_0199_0FCFF254E91741B0">
This, I conceive to be as po&s;&s;ible as for affafoetida to act chiefly upon the nerves, or ipecacuana and jalap upon the alimentary canal, without affecting other parts of the &s;y&s;tem. Until &s;uch medicines are di&s;covered, it becomes us to avail our&s;elves of the acce&s;s to the lymphatics, which is furni&s;hed us through the medium of the arteries by means of mo&s;t of the remedies which have been mention|ed.</P>
<P N="7">7. IF it &s;hould appear hereafter, that we have le&s;&s;ened the mortality of certain drop&s;ies by the theory and practice which have been propo&s;ed, yet many ca&s;es of drop&s;y mu&s;t &s;till occur in which they will afford us no aid. The ca&s;es I allude to, are drop&s;ies from enclo&s;ing cy&s;ts, from the o&s;&s;ifi|cation of certain arteries, from &s;chirri of certain vi&s;cera, from large ruptures of exhaling or lym|phatic ve&s;&s;els, from a peculiar and corro&s;ive acri|mony of the fluids, and la&s;tly, from an exhau&s;ted &s;tate of the whole &s;y&s;tem. The records of medi|cine furni&s;h us with in&s;tances of death from each of the above cau&s;es. But let us not de&s;pair. It becomes a phy&s;ician to believe, that there is no di&s;ea&s;e nece&s;&s;arily incurable; and that there exi&s;t in the womb of time, certain remedies for all tho&s;e di&s;orders which elude the pre&s;ent limits of the healing art.</P>

<HEAD>INQUIRY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING for many years been un&s;ucce&s;sful in all the ca&s;es, except two, of internal drop&s;y of the brain, which came under my care, I began to en|tertain doubts of the common theory of this di&s;or|der, and to &s;u&s;pect that in&s;tead of being con&s;idered as an idiopathic drop&s;y, the effu&s;ion of water &s;hould be con&s;idered only as the effect of a primary inflam|mation or conge&s;tion of blood in the brain.</P>
<P>I MENTIONED this opinion to my colleague Dr. Wi&s;tar in the month of June 1788, and taught it the winter following in my lectures. The year afterwards I was confirmed in it by hearing that the
<PB N="202" REF="026112_0202_0FCFF25F5D4FEFD0">
&s;ame idea had occurred to Dr. Quin. I have &s;ince read Dr. Quin's treati&s;e on the drop&s;y of the brain with great plea&s;ure, and con&s;ider it as the fir&s;t dawn of light which has been &s;hed upon the the|ory of this di&s;order. In pur&s;uing this &s;ubject, therefore, I &s;hall avail my&s;elf of Dr. Quin's di&s;|coveries, and endeavour to arrange the facts and ob&s;ervations I have collected in &s;uch a manner, as to form a connected theory from them, which I hope will lead to a new and more &s;ucce&s;sful mode of treating this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>I SHALL begin this Inquiry by delivering a few general propo&s;itions.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE Internal Drop&s;y of the Brain is a di&s;or|der confined chiefly to children.</P>
<P N="2">2. IN children the brain is larger in proportion to other parts of the body, than it is in adults; and of cour&s;e a greater proportion of blood is &s;ent to it in childhood, than in the &s;ub&s;equent periods of life.&mdash;The effects of this determination of blood to the brain appear in the mucous di&s;charge from the no&s;e, and in the &s;ores on the head and behind the ears, which are &s;o common in childhood.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="203" REF="026112_0203_0FCF49342AD3EDA0">3. IN all febrile di&s;ea&s;es there is a preternatural determination of blood to the brain. This occurs in a more e&s;pecial manner in children; hence the rea&s;on why they are &s;o apt to be affected by con|vul&s;ions in the eruptive fever of the &s;mall-pox, in dentition, in the di&s;ea&s;es from worms, and in the fir&s;t paroxy&s;m of intermitting fevers.</P>
<P N="4">4. IN fevers of every kind, and in every &s;tage of life, there is a di&s;po&s;ition to effu&s;ion in that part to which there is the greate&s;t determination. Thus in inflammatory fever, effu&s;ions take place in the lungs and in the joints. In the bilious fever they occur in the liver, and in the gout in every part of of the body. The matter effu&s;ed is always influ|enced by the &s;tructure of the part in which it takes place.</P>
<P>THESE propo&s;itions being premi&s;ed, I &s;hould have proceeded to mention the remote cau&s;es of this di&s;order; but as this inquiry may po&s;&s;ibly fall into the hands of &s;ome gentlemen who may not have acce&s;s to the de&s;cription of it as given by Dr. Whytt, Dr. Fothergill, and Dr. Quin, I &s;hall intro|duce a hi&s;tory of its &s;ymptoms taken from the la&s;t of tho&s;e authors. I prefer it to the hi&s;tories by Dr. Whytt and Dr. Fothergill, as it accords mo&s;t
<PB N="204" REF="026112_0204_0FCFF261E0C38708">
with the ordinary phaenomena of this di&s;order in this country.</P>
<Q><P>IN general the patient is at fir&s;t languid and inactive, often drow&s;y and peevi&s;h, but at inter|vals cheerful and apparently free from complaint. The appetite is weak, a nau&s;ea, and in many ca&s;es a vomiting occurs once or twice in the day, and the &s;kin is ob&s;erved to be hot and dry towards the evenings: &s;oon after the&s;e &s;ymptoms have appeared, the patient is affected with a &s;harp head-ach, chiefly in the fore-part, or if not there, generally in the crown of the head: it is &s;ome|times, however, confined to one &s;ide of the head, and, in that ca&s;e, when the po&s;ture of the body is erect, the head often inclines to the &s;ide affected. We frequently find al&s;o, that the head-ach alternates with the affection of the &s;tomach; the vomiting being le&s;s trouble&s;ome when the pain is mo&s;t violent, and <HI>vice ver&s;&acirc;</HI>; other parts of the body are likewi&s;e &s;ubject to temporary at|tacks of pain, viz. the extremities, or the bow|els, but more con&s;tantly the back of the neck, and between the &s;capulae; in all &s;uch ca&s;es the head is more free from unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>THE patient di&s;likes the light at this period; cries much, &s;leeps little, and when he does &s;leep, he grinds his teeth, picks his no&s;e, appears to be
<PB N="205" REF="026112_0205_0FCFF263CF9C0478">
unea&s;y, and &s;tarts often, &s;creaming as if he were terrified; the bowels are in the majority of ca|&s;es very much confined, though it &s;ometimes happens that they are in an oppo&s;ite &s;tate: the pul&s;e in this early &s;tage of the di&s;order, does not u&s;ually indicate any material derangement.</P>
<P>WHEN the &s;ymptoms above mentioned have continued for a few days, &s;ubject as they always are in this di&s;ea&s;e to great fluctuation, the axis of one eye is generally found to be turned in to|wards the no&s;e; the pupil on this &s;ide is rather more dilated than the other; and when both eyes have the axes directed inwards, (which &s;ometimes happens,) both pupils are larger than they are ob&s;erved to be in the eyes of healthy per&s;ons: the vomiting becomes more con&s;tant, and the head-ach more excruciating; every &s;ymptom of fever then makes its appearance, the pul&s;e is frequent, and the breathing quick; exacerbations of the fever take place towards the evening, and the face is occa&s;ionally flu&s;hed; u&s;ually one cheek is much more affected than the other; temporary per&s;pirations likewi&s;e break forth, which are not followed by any al|leviation of di&s;tre&s;s; a di&s;charge of blood from
<PB N="206" REF="026112_0206_0FCFF269D9BD9598">

<P>DELIRIUM, and that of the mo&s;t violent kind, particularly if the patient has arrived at the age of puberty, now takes place, and with all the preceding &s;ymptoms of fever, continues for a while to increa&s;e, until about fourteen days, often a much &s;horter &s;pace of time &s;hall have elap&s;ed &s;ince the appearance of the &s;ymptoms, which were fir&s;t mentioned in the above detail.</P>
<P>THE di&s;ea&s;e then undergoes that remarkable change, which &s;ometimes &s;uddenly points out the commencement of, what has been called its &s;econd &s;tage: the pul&s;e becomes &s;low but une|qual, both as to its &s;trength, and the intervals between the pul&s;ations; the pain of the head; or of whatever part had previou&s;ly been affected, &s;eems to abate, or at lea&s;t the patient becomes apparently le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of it; the interrupted &s;lumbers, or perpetual re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s which pre|vailed during the earlier periods of the di&s;order, are now &s;ucceeded by an almo&s;t lethargic tor|por, the &s;trabi&s;mus, and dilatation of the pupil increa&s;e, the patient lies with one, or both eyes half clo&s;ed, which, when minutely examined, are often found to be completely in&s;en&s;ible to

<P>IF every effort made by art fails to excite the &s;inking powers of life, the &s;ymptoms of what has been called the &s;econd &s;tage are &s;oon &s;uc|ceeded by others, which more certainly an|nounce the approach of death.&mdash;The pul&s;e a|gain becomes equal, but &s;o weak and quick, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to count it; a difficul|ty of breathing, nearly re&s;embling the <HI>Ster|tor Apoplecticus,</HI> is often ob&s;erved; &s;ometimes the eyes are &s;uffu&s;ed with blood, the flu&s;hing of the face is more frequent than before, but of &s;horter duration, and followed by a deadly pale|ne&s;s; red &s;pots, or blotches &s;ometimes appear on the body and limbs; deglutition becomes difficult, and convul&s;ions generally clo&s;e the &s;cene.

<P N="6">6. FROM the di&s;&s;ections of Lieutaud, Quin, and others, it appears further, that the internal drop&s;y of the brain has been ob&s;erved to &s;ucceed each of the following di&s;orders&mdash;viz. The colic&mdash; pal&s;y&mdash;melancholly&mdash;dy&s;entery&mdash;dentition&mdash;in&s;o|lation&mdash;&s;crophula&mdash;and the &s;udden healing of old &s;ores. I have &s;een two ca&s;es of it from the la&s;t cau&s;e, and one in which it was produced by the action of the vernal &s;un alone upon the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>FROM the facts which have been enumerated, and from di&s;&s;ections to be mentioned hereafter, it ap|pears, that the di&s;ea&s;e in its fir&s;t &s;tage is the effect of cau&s;es which produce a le&s;s degree of that in|flammation which con&s;titutes phrenitis, and that its &s;econd &s;tage is the effect of a le&s;s degree of that ef|fu&s;ion, which produces &s;erous apoplexy in adults.
<PB N="215" REF="026112_0215_0FCFF2830C2C93C0">
The former partakes of the nature of the chronic inflammation of Dr. Cullen, and of the a&s;thenic inflammation of Dr. Brown. I have taken the li|berty to call it <HI>Phrenicula,</HI> from its being a dimi|nutive &s;pecies or &s;tate of phrenitis. It bears the &s;ame relation to phrenitis when it ari&s;es from indi|rect cau&s;es, which pneumonicula does to pneu|mony,&mdash;and it is produced nearly in the &s;ame manner as the pulmonary con&s;umption, by debili|tating cau&s;es which act primarily on the whole &s;y|&s;tem. The peculiar &s;ize and texture of the brain, &s;eem to invite the inflammation and effu&s;ions which follow debility, to that organ in childhood, ju&s;t as the peculiar &s;tructure and &s;ituation of the lungs invite the &s;ame morbid phaenomena, after the body has acquired its growth, in youth and middle life. In the latter &s;tage which has been mentioned, the internal drop&s;y of the brain par|takes of &s;ome of the properties of apoplexy. It differs from it in being the effect of a <HI>&s;low,</HI> in&s;tead of a <HI>&s;ud|den</HI> effu&s;ion of water or blood, and in being the ef|fect of cau&s;es which are of an acute in&s;tead of a chronic nature. The more advanced per&s;ons are in life who are affected by this di&s;order, the more it approaches to the nature of the common apo|plexy, by a &s;peedy termination in life or death. Dr. Cullen has called it &s;imply by the name of "apoplexia hydrocephalica." I have preferred for
<PB N="216" REF="026112_0216_0FCFF284146F9140">
this &s;tage of the di&s;order the term of <HI>chronic apo|plexy</HI>; for I believe with Dr. Quin, that it has no connection with an hydropic diathe&s;is of the whole &s;y&s;tem. I am forced to adopt this opinion, from my having never &s;een it accompanied by drop&s;ical effu&s;ions in other parts of the body, nor a general drop&s;y accompanied by an internal drop&s;y of the brain. No more occurs in this di&s;ea&s;e than takes place when hydrothorax follows an inflammation of the lungs, or when &s;erous effu&s;ions follow a in|flammation of the joints. I do not &s;uppo&s;e that both inflammation, and effu&s;ion always attend in this di&s;order; on the contrary, di&s;&s;ections have &s;hewn &s;ome ca&s;es of inflammation, with little or no effu&s;ion, and &s;ome of effu&s;ion without inflamma|tion. Perhaps this variety may have been pro|duced by the different &s;tages of the di&s;ea&s;e in which death and the in&s;pection of the brain took place. Neither do I &s;uppo&s;e, that the two &s;tages which have been mentioned, always &s;ucceed each other in the common order of inflammation and ef|fu&s;ion. In every ca&s;e where the full ten&s;e&mdash;&s;low and intermitting pul&s;e occurs, I believe there is inflammation; and as this &s;tate of the pul&s;e occurs in mo&s;t ca&s;es in the beginning of the di&s;order, I &s;uppo&s;e the inflammation, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, to precede the effu&s;ion of water. I have met with only one ca&s;e in which the &s;low and

Her bowels were ob&s;tinately co|&s;tive, and her pul&s;e was full, ten&s;e, and &s;o &s;low as &s;eldom to exceed, for &s;everal days, from 56 to 60 &s;trokes in a minute. I ordered her to loo&s;e ten ounces of blood every day for three days &s;ucce&s;&s;ive|ly, and gave her, on each of tho&s;e days, &s;trong do&s;es of jalap and aloes. The la&s;t blood which was drawn from her was &s;izy. The purges procu|red from three to ten di&s;charges every day from her bowels. On the 12th, &s;he appeared to be much better. Her pul&s;e was le&s;s ten&s;e, and beat 80 &s;trokes in a minute. On the 14th, &s;he had a fainting fit. On the 15th, &s;he &s;at up, and called for food. The pupils of her eyes now recovered their &s;en&s;ibility
<PB N="223" REF="026112_0223_0FCFF2939FBA3528">
to light, as well as their natural &s;ize. Her head-ach left her, and on the 17th, &s;he appeared to be in good health. Her pul&s;e, however, continued to beat between 50 and 60 &s;trokes only in a mi|nute, and retained a &s;mall portion of irregular ac|tion for &s;everal days after &s;he recovered.</P>
<P>I AM the more di&s;po&s;ed to pronounce the ca&s;es which have been de&s;cribed to have been internal drop&s;y of the brain, from my having never been de|ceived in a &s;ingle ca&s;e in which I have examined the brains of patients whom I have &s;u&s;pected to have died of it.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE, with Dr. Quin, that this di&s;order is much more frequent than is commonly &s;up|po&s;ed. I can recollect many ca&s;es of anomalous fever and head-ach in children, which have exci|ted the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing apprehen&s;ions of an ap|proaching internal drop&s;y of the brain, but which have yielded in a few days to bleeding, or to pur|ges and bli&s;ters. I think it probable, that &s;ome, or perhaps mo&s;t of the&s;e ca&s;es, might have termina|ted in an effu&s;ion of water in the brain, had they been left to them&s;elves, or not been treated with the above remedies. I believe further, that it is often prevented by all tho&s;e phy&s;icians who treat the fir&s;t &s;tage of febrile di&s;ea&s;es in children with
<PB N="224" REF="026112_0224_0FCFF294C804CBA0">
evacuations, ju&s;t as the pulmonary con&s;umption is prevented by bleeding, and low diet, in an inflam|matory catarrh.</P>
<P>I AM &s;orry, however, to add in this place, that I have failed in five ca&s;es, in which I u&s;ed the re|medy of blood-letting in the phrenicula, or in the inflammatory &s;tage of this di&s;order; perhaps it was not u&s;ed &s;o copiou&s;ly as the di&s;ea&s;e required. If the relation of this di&s;order to pneumonicula be the &s;ame in its cure, that I have &s;uppo&s;ed it to be in its cau&s;e, then I am per&s;uaded, that the &s;ame ex|ce&s;s in blood-letting is indicated in it, above what is nece&s;&s;ary in phrenitis, that has been practi&s;ed in pneumonicula, above what is nece&s;&s;ary in the cure of an acute inflammation of the lungs. The continuance, and in &s;ome in&s;tances, the increa&s;e of the appetite in the internal drop&s;y of the brain, would &s;eem to favour this opinion no le&s;s in this di&s;order, than in the inflammatory &s;tate of pulmo|nary con&s;umption. Where the internal drop&s;y is obviou&s;ly the effect of a fall, or of any other cau&s;e which acts <HI>directly</HI> on the brain, there can be no doubt of the &s;afety of very plentiful bleeding; all practical writers upon &s;urgery concur in advi&s;ing it. Dr. Penington has favoured me with an ex|tract from Mr Cline's manu&s;cript lectures upon anatomy, delivered in London in the winter of 1792, which places the advantage of blood-letting,
<PB N="225" REF="026112_0225_0FCFF29DD12A8BE8">
in that &s;pecies of inflammation which follows a lo|cal injury of the brain, in a very &s;trong point of light. <Q>I know (&s;ays he) that &s;everal practition|ers object to the u&s;e of evacuations, as remedies for concu&s;&s;ions of the brain, becau&s;e of the weakne&s;s of the pul&s;e, but in the&s;e ca&s;es, the pul&s;e is <HI>depre&s;&s;ed.</HI> Be&s;ides experience &s;hews, that evacuations are frequently attended with very great advantages. I remember a remark|able ca&s;e of a man in this [St. Thomas's ho&s;pi|tal] who was under the care of Mr. Baker. He lay in a comato&s;e &s;tate, for three weeks after an injury of the head. During that time, he was bled <HI>twenty</HI> times, that is to &s;ay, he was bled once every day upon an average. He was bled twice a day <HI>plentifully,</HI> but towards the con|clu&s;ion, he was bled more &s;paringly, and only every other day; but at each bleeding, there were taken, upon an average, about &s;ixteen oun|ces of blood. In con&s;equence of this treatment, the man perfectly recovered his health and rea|&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>A II. remedy to be u&s;ed in the fir&s;t &s;tage of this di&s;order is PURGES. I have con&s;tantly ob&s;er|ved all the patients who&s;e ca&s;es have been related, to be relieved by plentiful and repeated evacua|tions from the bowels. I was led to the u&s;e of
<PB N="226" REF="026112_0226_0FCFF29F1EC6CCA8">
frequent purges, by having long ob&s;erved their good effects in pal&s;ies, and other ca&s;es of conge&s;tion in the brain, where blood letting was un&s;afe, and where it had been u&s;ed without benefit. In the Leip&s;ic Commentaries,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. xxix. p. 139.</NOTE> there is an account of a ca&s;e of internal drop&s;y of the brain, which follow|ed the mea&s;les, being cured by no other medicines than purges and diuretics. I can &s;ay nothing in favor of the latter remedy, in this di&s;order, from my own experience. The digitalis purpurea, has been u&s;ed in this city, by &s;everal re&s;pectable practi|tioners, but I believe, in no one in&s;tance with any advantage.</P>
<P N="3">III. BLISTERS have been uniformly recommend|ed by all practical writers upon this di&s;ea&s;e. I have applied them to the head, neck and temples, and generally with obvious relief to the pain in the head. They &s;hould be omitted in no &s;tage of the di&s;order; for even in the inflammatory &s;tage, the di&s;charge they occa&s;ion from the ve&s;&s;els of the head, greatly overbalances their &s;timulating effects upon the whole &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P N="4">IV. MERCURY was long con&s;idered as the only remedy, which gave the lea&s;t chance of a recovery
<PB N="227" REF="026112_0227_0FCFF2A0A1AF6DA8">
from this formidable di&s;order. Out of all the ca|&s;es in which I gave it, before the year 1790, I &s;ucceeded in only two&mdash;one of them was a child of three years old, the other was a young woman of 26 years of age. I am the more &s;atisfied that the latter ca&s;e was internal drop&s;y of the brain, from my patient having relap&s;ed, and died between two and three years afterwards, of the &s;ame di&s;or|der. Perhaps my repeated failures in the u&s;e of this remedy, were occa&s;ioned by my giving it be|fore the inflammatory action of the &s;y&s;tem was &s;ufficiently &s;ubdued, by previous evacuations. The &s;ame rule &s;hould probably be ob&s;erved in giving it in this di&s;order, which is practi&s;ed in admini&s;ter|ing it in effu&s;ions of water in other parts of the body, and in all other di&s;ea&s;es of dimini&s;hed action in the &s;y&s;tem. In none of the ca&s;es, except the 5th, in which I u&s;ed bleeding and purging with &s;ucce&s;s, did I pre&s;cribe calomel with any other view than to encrea&s;e the evacuation from the bowels.</P>
<P N="5">V. LINEN CLOTHS wetted with cold vinegar or water, and applied to the forehead, contri|bute very much to relieve the pain in the head. In the ca&s;e of I. C.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ca&s;e II.</NOTE> the &s;olution of ice in the vinegar appeared to afford the mo&s;t obvious relief of this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ymptom.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="026112_0228_0FCFF2A280437D58">A PUNCTURE in the brain has been propo&s;ed by &s;ome writers to di&s;charge the water from its ventricles. If the theory I have delivered be true, the operation promi&s;es nothing, even though it could always be performed with perfect &s;afety. In ca&s;es of local injuries, or of inflammation from any cau&s;e, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;e the di&s;order; and in ca&s;es of effu&s;ion only, the debilitated &s;tate of the whole &s;y&s;tem forbids us to hope for any relief from &s;uch a local remedy.</P>
<P>BARK, wine, and opium promi&s;e much more &s;ucce&s;s in the la&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;order. I can &s;ay nothing in their favor from my own experience; but from the aid they afford to mercury in other di&s;ea&s;es, I conceive they might be made to accom|pany it with advantage.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE MEASLES, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE weather, in December 1788, and in Ja|nuary 1789, was variable, but &s;eldom very cold. On the fir&s;t of February 1789, at 6 oclock in the morning, the mercury in Farenheit's ther|mometer, fell five degrees below 0 in the city of Philadelphia. At twenty miles from the city, on the Schuylkill, it fell 12^0 below 0, at the &s;ame
<PB N="232" REF="026112_0231_0FCFF2B129A915B8">
hour. On the 19th and 20th of this month, there fell a quantity of &s;now, the depth of which, upon an average, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be about eight or ten inches. On the 23d, 24th, 25th and 27th, the weather was very cold. The mercury fluc|tuated during the&s;e days between 4 and 10^0 above 0.</P>
<P>IN the intervals between the&s;e cold days, the weather frequently moderated, &s;o that the Dela|ware was frozen and thawed not le&s;s than four times. It was not navigable till the eighth of March. There were in all, during the winter and month of March, &s;ixteen di&s;tinct falls of &s;now.</P>
<P>IN April and May there were a few warm days; but upon the whole, it was a very cold and back|ward &s;pring. The peaches failed almo&s;t univer&s;al|ly. There were no &s;trawberries or cherries on the 24th of May, and every other vegetable pro|duct was equally backward. A country woman of 84 years of age, informed me, that it was the colde&s;t &s;pring &s;he had ever known. It was un|comfortable to &s;it without fire till the fir&s;t of June.</P>
<P>THE mea&s;les appeared fir&s;t in the Northern Li|berties, in December. They &s;pread &s;lowly in Ja|nuary,
<PB N="233" REF="026112_0232_0FCFF2B29649FA78">
and were not univer&s;al in the city till February and March.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e, like many others, had its <HI>precur&s;or.</HI> It was either a gum-boil, or a &s;ore on the tongue. They were very common, but not univer&s;al. They occurred in &s;ome in&s;tances, &s;everal days before the fever, but in general, they made their appear|ance during the eruptive fever, and were a &s;ure mark of the approaching eruption of the meazles. I was fir&s;t led to ob&s;erve this fact, from having read Dr. Quin's accurate account of the mea&s;les in Jamaica. I &s;hall now proceed to mention the &s;ymptoms of the mea&s;les as they appeared in the different parts of the body.</P>
<P N="1">1. IN the HEAD, they produced great pain, &s;welling of the eye-lids, &s;o as to ob&s;truct the eye|&s;ight, tooth-ach, bleeding at the no&s;e, tinnitus au|rium, and deafne&s;s; al&s;o coma for two days, and convul&s;ions. I &s;aw the la&s;t &s;ymptom only in one in&s;tance. It was brought on by a &s;toppage of a running from the ear.</P>
<P N="2">2. IN the THROAT and LUNGS, they produced a &s;orene&s;s and hoar&s;ene&s;s, acute or dull pains in the brea&s;t and &s;ides, and a painful or di&s;tre&s;&s;ing cough. In one ca&s;e, this cough continued for two hours without any intermi&s;&s;ion, attended by copious
<PB N="234" REF="026112_0233_0FCFF2B4220E46E8">
expectoration. In two ca&s;es, I &s;aw a con&s;tant in|voluntary di&s;charge of phlegm and mucus from the mouth, without any cough. One of them terminated fatally. Spitting of blood occurred in &s;everal in&s;tances. The &s;ymptoms of pneumonia vera notha and typhoides were very common. I &s;aw two fatal ca&s;es from pneumonia notha, in both of which, the patients died with the trunk of the body in an erect po&s;ture. I met with two ca&s;es in which there was no cough till the eruption made its appearance on the fourth day, and one which was accompanied by all the u&s;ual &s;ymptoms of the cynanche trachealis humoralis.</P>
<P N="3">3. IN the STOMACH the mea&s;les produced, in many in&s;tances, &s;ickne&s;s and vomiting. And,</P>
<P N="4">4. IN the BOWELS, griping, diarrhoea, and in &s;ome in&s;tances, bloody &s;tools. The diarrhoea oc|curred in every &s;tage of the di&s;order, but it was bloody and mo&s;t painful in its decline. I attended a black girl who di&s;charged a great many worms, but without the lea&s;t relief of any of her &s;ymp|toms.</P>
<P>THERE was a great variety in this di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;1&s;t, In the <HI>time</HI> of the attack of the fever, from the <HI>time</HI> of the reception of the contagion. In gene|ral
<PB N="235" REF="026112_0234_0FCF493B5C01B168">
the interval was fourteen days, but it frequent|ly appeared before and &s;ometimes later than that period.</P>
<P N="2">2nd. IN the time of the eruption, from the be|ginning of the fever. It generally appeared on the third and fourth days. In one ca&s;e, Dr. Wa|ters informed me, it did not appear till the eighth day.</P>
<P N="3">3d. IN the abatement or continuance of the fever after the eruption.</P>
<P N="4">4th. IN the colour and figure of the eruption. In &s;ome it put on a <HI>pale</HI> red, in others a <HI>deep,</HI> and in a few a <HI>livid</HI> colour, re&s;embling an incipient mor|tification. In &s;ome there appeared red blotches, in others an equally diffu&s;ed redne&s;s, and in a few, eruptions like the &s;mall pox, called by Dr. Cullen, rubiola varioloides.</P>
<P N="5">5. IN the duration of the eruption on the &s;kin. It remained in mo&s;t ca&s;es only three or four days; but in one, which came under my care, it remained nine days.</P>
<P N="6">6. IN the manner of its retroce&s;&s;ion. I &s;aw very few ca&s;es of its leaving the branny appear|ance
<PB N="236" REF="026112_0235_0FCFF2B879D9EFC0">
&s;o generally &s;poken of by authors on the &s;kin.</P>
<P N="7">7. IN not affecting many per&s;ons, and even fa|milies who were expo&s;ed to it.</P>
<P>THE &s;ymptoms which continued in many after the retroce&s;&s;ion of the mea&s;les, were cough,&mdash; hoar&s;ene&s;s,&mdash;or complete aphonia, which continued in two ca&s;es for two weeks; al&s;o diarrhoea, op|thalmy, a bad ta&s;te in the mouth, a defect or ex|ce&s;s of appetite, and a fever, which in &s;ome in|&s;tances was of the intermitting kind, but which in more a&s;&s;umed the more dangerous form of the typhus mitior. I attended two ca&s;es of internal drop&s;y of the brain &s;oon after it. One was evi|dently excited by a fall. They both ended fatally.</P>
<P>DURING the prevalence of the di&s;ea&s;e, I ob|&s;erved &s;everal per&s;ons (who had had the mea&s;les, and who were clo&s;ely confined to the rooms of per&s;ons ill with them) to be affected with a &s;light cough, &s;ore throat, and even &s;ores in the mouth. I find the &s;ame fact taken notice of by Dr. Quier.</P>
<P>BUT I ob&s;erved further, many children to be af|fected by a fever, cough, and all the other &s;ymptoms of the mea&s;les which have been mentioned, except a general eruption, for, in &s;ome, there was a trifling efflore&s;cence about the neck and brea&s;t. I ob|&s;erved
<PB N="237" REF="026112_0236_0FCFF2B959083018">
the &s;ame thing in 1773 and 1783. In my note book, I find the following account of the ap|pearance of this di&s;ea&s;e in children in the year 1773. <Q>The mea&s;les appeared in March, a ca|tarrh (for by that name I then called it) ap|peared at the &s;ame time, and was often mi&s;taken for them, the &s;ymptoms being nearly the &s;ame in both. In the catarrh there was in &s;ome in|&s;tances a trifling eruption. A lax often attended it, and &s;ome who had it, had an extremely &s;ore mouth.</Q></P>
<P>I WAS the more &s;truck with this di&s;ea&s;e, from finding it was taken notice of by Dr. Sydenham. He calls it a morbillous fever. I likewi&s;e find an account of it in the 2d article of the 5th volume of the Edinburgh Medical E&s;&s;ays. The words of the author who is anonymous, are as follow. <Q>During this mea&s;ley &s;ea&s;on, &s;everal per&s;ons, who never had the mea&s;les, had all the &s;ymp|toms of mea&s;les, which went off in a few days without any eruptions. The &s;ame per&s;ons had the mea&s;les months or years afterwards.</Q> Is this di&s;ea&s;e a common fever, marked by the reigning epidemic, and produced in the &s;ame manner, and by the &s;ame cau&s;es, as the variolous fever de&s;cribed by Dr. Sydenham, which he &s;ays prevailed at the
<PB N="238" REF="026112_0237_0FCFF2BAF08660E8">
&s;ame time with the &s;mall pox? I think it is not. My rea&s;ons for this opinion are as follow.</P>
<P N="1">1. I NEVER &s;aw it affect any but children, in the degree that has been mentioned, and &s;uch only as had never had the mea&s;les.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT affected whole families at the &s;ame time. It proved fatal to one of three children whom it affected on the &s;ame day.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT terminated in a pulmonary con&s;umption in a boy of ten years old, with all the &s;ymptoms which attend that di&s;ea&s;e when it follows the re|gular mea&s;les.</P>
<P N="4">4. IT affected a child in one family on the &s;ame day that two other members of the &s;ame family were affected by the genuine mea&s;les.</P>
<P N="5">5. IT appeared on the u&s;ual days of the genuine mea&s;les, from the time the per&s;ons affected by it were expo&s;ed to its contagion. And,</P>
<P N="6">6. It communicated the di&s;ea&s;e in one family, in the u&s;ual time in which the di&s;ea&s;e is taken from the genuine mea&s;les.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="026112_0238_0FCFF2BC56811008">THE mea&s;les then appear to follow the analogy of the &s;mall pox, which affects &s;o &s;uperficially as to be taken a &s;econd time, and which produce on per|&s;ons who have had them what are called the nur&s;e pock. They follow likewi&s;e the analogy of another di&s;ea&s;e, viz. the &s;carlatina angino&s;a. In the account of the epidemic for 1773, publi&s;hed in the third volume of the Edinburgh Medical E&s;&s;ays, we are told, that &s;uch patients as had previou&s;ly had the &s;carlet fever without &s;ore throats, took the &s;ore throat, and had no eruption, while tho&s;e who had previou&s;ly had the &s;ore throat had a &s;carlet eruption, but the throat remained free from the di&s;temper. All other per&s;ons who were affected had both.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e facts, I have taken the liberty of calling it the <HI>Internal Mea&s;les,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h it from that &s;pecies which is <HI>external.</HI> I think the di&s;covery of this new &s;pecies of this di&s;order of &s;ome application to practice.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT will lead us to be cautious in declaring any di&s;ea&s;e to be the external mea&s;les in which there is not a general eruption. From my ignorance of this, I have been led to commit &s;everal mi&s;takes which were di&s;honourable to the profe&s;&s;ion. I was called during the prevalence of the mea&s;les in the above-named &s;ea&s;on, to vi&s;it a girl of twelve
<PB N="240" REF="026112_0239_0FCFF2C21B519F30">
years old, with an eruption on the &s;kin. I called it the mea&s;les. The mother told me, it was im|po&s;&s;ible, for that I had in 1783 attended her for the &s;ame di&s;order. I &s;u&s;pect the anonimous author before-mentioned has fallen into the &s;ame error. He adds to the account before quoted the follow|ing words. <Q>Others who had undergone the mea&s;les formerly, had at <HI>this time,</HI> a fever of the eri&s;ipelatous kind, with eruptions like to which nettles cau&s;e, and all the <HI>previous</HI> and concomi|tant &s;ymptoms of the mea&s;les from the begin|ning to the end of the di&s;ea&s;e.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. IF inoculation, or any other mode of le&s;&s;en|ing the violence of the di&s;ea&s;e &s;hould be adopted, it will be of con&s;equence to know what per&s;ons are &s;ecure from the attacks of it, and who are &s;till ex|po&s;ed to it.</P>
<P>I SHALL now add a &s;hort account of my method of treating this di&s;order.</P>
<P>MANY hundred families came through the di&s;|ea&s;e without the help of a phy&s;ician. But in many ca&s;es it was attended with peculiar danger, and in &s;ome with death. I think it was much more fatal than in the years 1773 and 1783, probably owing to the variable weather in the winter, and the coldne&s;s and dampne&s;s of the &s;ucceeding &s;pring. Dr. Huxham &s;ays, he once &s;aw the mea&s;les attend|ed
<PB N="241" REF="026112_0240_0FCFF2C40C562460">
with peculiar mortality, during a late cold and damp &s;pring in England. It was much more fatal (caeteris paribus) to adults than to young people.</P>
<P>THE remedies I u&s;ed were,</P>
<P N="1">1. BLEEDING, in all ca&s;es where great pain and cough with a hard pul&s;e attended. In &s;ome I found it nece&s;&s;ary to repeat this remedy. But I met with many ca&s;es in which it was forbidden by the weakne&s;s of the pul&s;e, and by other marks of great debility.</P>

<P N="3">3. DEMULCENT and DILUTING drinks. The&s;e were barley water, bran, and flax&s;eed tea, dried cherry and raw apple water, al&s;o beverage, and cyder and water. The la&s;t drink I found to be the mo&s;t agreeable to my patients of any that have been mentioned.</P>
<P N="4">4. BLISTERS to the neck, &s;ides, and extremi|ties, according to the &s;ymptoms. They were u&s;e|ful in every &s;tage of the di&s;order.</P>

In that ca&s;e of mea&s;les, formerly mentioned, which was ac|companied by &s;ymptoms of cynanche trachialis hu|moralis, I gave calomel with the happie&s;t effects. In the admi&s;&s;ion of <HI>fre&s;h air</HI> I ob&s;erved a medium as to its temperature, and accommodated it to the degrees of action in the &s;y&s;tem. In different parts of the country, in Penn&s;ylvania and New-Jer&s;ey, I heard with great plea&s;ure of the <HI>cold air</HI> being u&s;ed as freely and as &s;ucce&s;sfully in this di&s;order as in the inflammatory &s;mall pox. The &s;ame people who were &s;o much benefited by <HI>cool air,</HI> I was informed, drank plentfully of cold water during every &s;tage of the di&s;order. One thing in favor of this coun|try practice de&s;erves to be mentioned, and that is, evident advantage aro&s;e in all the ca&s;es which I at|tended, from patients leaving their beds in the fe|brile &s;tate of this di&s;ea&s;e. But this was practi&s;ed only by tho&s;e in whom inflammatory diathe&s;is prevailed, for the&s;e alone had &s;trength enough to bear it.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="026112_0242_0FCFF2D05B3E5998">THE convale&s;cent &s;tate of this di&s;ea&s;e required particular attention.</P>
<P N="1">1. A DIARRHAEA often continued to be trouble|&s;ome after other &s;ymptoms had abated. I relieved it by opiates and demulcent drinks. Bleeding has been recommended for it, but I did not find it ne|ce&s;&s;ary in a &s;ingle ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. AN OPTHALMIA which &s;ometimes attended, yielded to a&s;tringent collyria and bli&s;ters.</P>
<P N="3">3. WHERE a cough or fever followed &s;o &s;light as not to require bleeding, I advi&s;ed a milk and vegetable diet, country air, and moderate warmth; for whatever might have been the relation of the lungs in the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e to cold air, they were now evidently too much debilitated to bear it.</P>
<P N="4">4. IT is a common practi&s;e to pre&s;cribe purges after the mea&s;les. After the a&s;thenic &s;tate of this di&s;order they certainly do harm. In all ca&s;es, the effects of them may be better obviated by diet, full or low, &s;uitable clothing, and gentle exerci&s;e, or country air.

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE INFLUENZA, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE latter end of the month of Augu&s;t in the &s;ummer of 1789, was &s;o very cool that fires became agreeable. The month of September was cool, dry, and plea&s;ant. During the whole of this month, and for &s;ome days before it began, and af|ter it ended, there had been no rain. In the begin|ning of October, a number of the members of the
<PB N="248" REF="026112_0246_0FCFF2DA4F1469A0">
fir&s;t Congre&s;s, that had a&s;&s;embled in New-York, under the pre&s;ent national government, arrived in Philadelphia, much indi&s;po&s;ed with colds. They a&s;cribed them to the fatigue and night air to which they had been expo&s;ed in travelling in the public &s;tages; but from the number of per&s;ons who were affected, from the uniformity of their complaints, and from the rapidity with which it was propaga|ted through our city, it &s;oon became evident that it was the di&s;ea&s;e &s;o well known of late years, by the name of the Influenza.</P>
<P>THE &s;ymptoms which u&s;hered in the di&s;ea&s;e, were generally a hoar&s;ene&s;s, &s;ore-throat, a &s;en&s;e of wearine&s;s, chills, and a fever. After the di&s;ea&s;e was formed, it affected more or le&s;s the following parts of the body. Many complained of acute pains in the HEAD. The&s;e pains were frequently fixed be|tween the eye-balls, and in three ca&s;es which came under my notice, they were terminated by ab&s;ce&s;&s;es in the frontal &s;inus, which di&s;charged them&s;elves through the no&s;e. The pain, in one of the&s;e ca|&s;es, before the rupture of the ab&s;ce&s;s, was &s;o exqui&s;ite, that my patient informed me, that he felt as if he &s;hould lo&s;e his rea&s;on. Many com|plained of a great itching in the EYE-LIDS. In &s;ome, the eye-lids were &s;welled. In others, a co|pious effu&s;ion of water took place from the EYES;
<PB N="249" REF="026112_0247_0FCF494159DD3B28">
and in a few, there was a true ophthalmia. Ma|ny complained of great pains in one EAR, and &s;ome of pains in both EARS. In &s;ome the&s;e pains termi|nated in ab&s;ce&s;&s;es, which di&s;charged for &s;ome days a bloody or purulent matter. In others, there was a &s;welling behind each ear without a &s;uppuration. SNEEZING was an univer&s;al &s;ymp|tom. In &s;ome it occurred not le&s;s than fifty times in a day. The matter di&s;charged from the no&s;e, was &s;o acrid as to inflame the no&s;trils, and the up|per-lip, in &s;uch a manner as to bring on &s;wellings, &s;ores, and &s;cabs in many people. In &s;ome, the no&s;e di&s;charged drops, and in a few, &s;treams of blood, to the amount, in one ca&s;e, of twenty oun|ces. In many ca&s;es, it was &s;o much ob&s;tructed, as to render breathing through it difficult. In &s;ome there was a total defect of TASTE. In others there was a bad ta&s;te in the mouth, which fre|quently continued through the whole cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e. In &s;ome there was a want of APPE|TITE. In others it was perfectly natural. Some complained of a &s;orene&s;s in their mouths, as if they had been inflamed by holding pepper in them. Some had SWELLED JAWS, and many complained of the TOOTH-ACH. I &s;aw only one ca&s;e in which the di&s;ea&s;e produced a COMA.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="026112_0248_0FCFF2E190581118">MANY were affected with pains in the BREAST and SIDES. A difficulty of breathing attended in &s;ome, and a COUGH was univer&s;al. Sometimes this cough alternated with a pain in the head. Sometimes it preceded this pain, and &s;ometimes it followed it. It was at all times di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. In &s;ome in&s;tances it re&s;embled the chin cough. One per&s;on expired in a fit of coughing, and many per&s;ons &s;pat blood in con&s;equence of its violence. I &s;aw &s;everal patients in whom the di&s;ea&s;e affected the trachea chiefly, producing great difficulty of breathing, and, in one ca&s;e, a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the voice, and I heard of one ca&s;e in which the di&s;|ea&s;e, by falling on the trachea, produced a cynan|che trachealis. In mo&s;t of the ca&s;es which termi|nated fatally, the patients died of pneumonia no|tha.</P>
<P>THE STOMACH was &s;ometimes affected by nau|&s;ea, and vomiting; but this was far from being an univer&s;al &s;ymptom.</P>
<P>I MET with four ca&s;es in which the whole force of the di&s;ea&s;e fell upon the BOWELS and went off in a diarrhoea; but in general the bowels were re|gular or co&s;tive.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="026112_0249_0FCFF2E4776E1810">THE LIMBS were affected with &s;uch acute pains as to be mi&s;taken for the rheumati&s;m, or for the break-bone-fever of 1780. The pains were mo&s;t acute in the back and thighs.</P>
<P>PROFUSE SWEATS appeared in many over the whole body in the beginning, but without afford|ing any relief. It was in &s;ome in&s;tances accompa|nied by ery&s;ipelatous, and in four ca&s;es which came to my knowledge, it was followed by miliary erup|tions.</P>
<P>THE pul&s;e was &s;ometimes ten&s;e, and quick, but &s;eldom full. In a great majority of tho&s;e whom I vi&s;ited it was quick, weak, and &s;oft.</P>
<P>THERE was no appearance in the urine differ|ent from what is common in all fevers.</P>
<P>THE di&s;ea&s;e had evident remi&s;&s;ions, and the fe|ver &s;eldom continued above three or four days; but the cough, and &s;ome other trouble&s;ome &s;ymp|toms, &s;ometimes continued two or three weeks.</P>
<P>IN a few per&s;ons, the fever terminated in a te|dious and dangerous typhus.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="026112_0250_0FCFF2E630B30A80">IN &s;everal pregnant women it produced uterine haemorrhages and abortions.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is remarkable that abortions are produced chiefly by contagious fevers, &s;uch as the plague, the &s;mall-pox, and the mea&s;les, while inflammatory and bilious fevers, and even the dy&s;entery which frequently agitate the female &s;y&s;tem more violently, &s;eldom induce tho&s;e effects.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT affected adults of both &s;exes alike. A few old people e&s;caped it. It pa&s;&s;ed by children un|der eight years old with a few exceptions. Out of five and thirty maniacs in the Penn&s;ylvania ho&s;|pital, only three were affected by it. No profe&s;|&s;ion or occupation e&s;caped it. The &s;mell of tar and tobacco did not pre&s;erve the per&s;ons who worked in them from the contagion&mdash;nor did the u&s;e of tobacco, in &s;nuff, &s;moking, or chewing af|ford a &s;ecurity again&s;t it.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Howard informs us that the u&s;e of tobacco is not a pre&s;ervative again&s;t the plague as has formerly been &s;up|po&s;ed; of cour&s;e that apology for the u&s;e of an offen&s;ive weed &s;hould not be admitted.</NOTE></P>
<P>EVEN previous and exi&s;ting di&s;ea&s;es did not pro|tect patients from it. It in&s;inuated into &s;ick cham|bers, and blended it&s;elf with every &s;pecies of chro|nic complaint.</P>
<P>IT was remarkable that per&s;ons who worked in
<PB N="253" REF="026112_0251_0FCFF2E7102FAD40">
the open air, &s;uch as &s;ailors, and long-&s;hore-men (to u&s;e a mercantile epithet) had it much wor&s;e than trade&s;men who worked within doors. A body of &s;urveyors in the ea&s;tern woods of Penn&s;ylvania, who caught it all at once from one of their attendants, &s;uffered extremely from it. Even the vigor of con&s;titution, which is imparted by the &s;avage life, did not mitigate its violence. Mr. Andrew Ellicot, the geographer of the United States, informed me that he was a witne&s;s of its affecting the Indians in the neighbourhood of Niagara with peculiar force. The cough which attended this di&s;order, was &s;o new and &s;o irritating a complaint among them, that they a&s;cribed it to witchcraft.</P>
<P>IT proved mo&s;t fatal on the &s;ea-&s;hore of the U|nited States.</P>
<P>MANY people who had recovered, were affected a &s;econd time with all the &s;ymptoms of the di&s;or|der. I &s;hould have a&s;cribed this &s;econd attack to the &s;en&s;ible qualities of the atmo&s;phere, had I not ob&s;erved it to affect tho&s;e per&s;ons chiefly who had occa&s;ionally changed their place of re&s;idence du|ring the prevalence of the di&s;order. I met with a woman, who after recovering from it in Philadel|phia, took it a &s;econd time in New-York, and a third time upon her return to Philadelphia.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="026112_0252_0FCFF2EA2D7A3640">MANY thou&s;and people had the di&s;order who were not confined to their hou&s;es, but tran&s;acted bu&s;ine&s;s as u&s;ual out of doors.&mdash;A perpetual coughing was heard in every &s;treet of the city.&mdash; Buying and &s;elling were rendered tedious by the coughing of the farmer and the citizen who met in market places. It even rendered divine &s;ervice &s;carcely intelligible in the churches.</P>
<P>A FEW per&s;ons who were expo&s;ed to the conta|gion e&s;caped it, and &s;ome had it &s;o lightly as &s;carce|ly to be &s;en&s;ible of it. Of the per&s;ons who were confined to their hou&s;es, not a fourth part of them kept their beds.</P>
<P>IT proved fatal (with few exceptions) only to old people, and to per&s;ons who had been previou&s;|ly debilitated by con&s;umptive complaints. It like|wi&s;e carried off &s;everal hard drinkers. It termina|ted in a&s;thma in three per&s;ons who&s;e ca&s;es came un|der my notice, and in pulmonary con&s;umption, in many more. I met with an in&s;tance in a lady, who was much relieved of a chronic complaint in her liver; and I heard of another in&s;tance of a clergy|man who&s;e general health was much improved by a &s;evere attack of this di&s;order.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="026112_0253_0FCFF2EB9D726FD8">THE contagion was not wholly confined to the human &s;pecies. It affected two cats, two hou&s;e-dogs, and one hor&s;e within the &s;phere of my ob|&s;ervations. One of the dogs di&s;turbed his mi&s;tre&s;s &s;o much by coughing at night, that &s;he gave him ten drops of laudanum for &s;everal nights, which perfectly compo&s;ed him. One of the cats had a vo|miting with her cough. The hor&s;e breathed as if he had been affected by the cynanche trachialis.</P>
<P>THE &s;carlatina angino&s;a, which prevailed during the &s;ummer, di&s;appeared after the fir&s;t of October; but appeared again after the influenza left the city. Nor was the remitting fever &s;een during the pre|valence of the reigning epidemic.</P>
<P>I INOCULATED about twenty children for the &s;mall-pox during this prevalence of the Influenza, and never &s;aw that di&s;ea&s;e exhibit a more favora|able appearance.</P>
<P>IN the treatment of the Influenza I was go|verned by the &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem. Where inflammatory diathe&s;is di&s;covered it&s;elf by a full or ten&s;e pul&s;e, or where great difficulty of breath|ing occurred, and the pul&s;e was low and weak in the beginning of the di&s;order, I ordered moderate bleeding. In a few ca&s;es in which the &s;ymptoms
<PB N="256" REF="026112_0254_0FCFF2EE946340E8">
of pneumony attended, I bled a &s;econd time with advantage. In all the&s;e in&s;tances of inflammatory affection I gave the u&s;ual antiphlogi&s;tic medicines. I found that vomits did not terminate the di&s;order, as they often do a common catarrh, in the cour&s;e of a day, or of a few hours.</P>
<P>IN ca&s;es where no inflammatory action appeared in the &s;y&s;tem, I pre&s;cribed cordial drinks and diet, and forbad every kind of evacuation. I &s;aw &s;eve|ral in&s;tances of per&s;ons who had langui&s;hed for a week or two with the di&s;order, who were &s;uddenly cured by eating a hearty meal, or by drinking half a pint of wine, or a pint of warm punch. In all the&s;e ca&s;es of debility, liquid laudanum gave great relief, not only by &s;u&s;pending the cough, but by ea&s;ing the pains in the bones.</P>
<P>I MET with a ca&s;e of an old lady who was &s;ud|denly and perfectly cured of her cough by a fright.</P>
<P>THE duration of the di&s;order in our city was a|bout &s;ix weeks&mdash;It &s;pread from New-York and Philadelphia in all directions, and in the cour&s;e of a few months pervaded every &s;tate in the union. It was carried from the United States to &s;everal of the We&s;t India i&s;lands. It prevailed in the i&s;land
<PB N="257" REF="026112_0255_0FCFF2F03615DEF8">
of Grenada in the month of November 1789, and it was heard of in the cour&s;e of the en&s;uing winter in the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements in South America.</P>
<P>THE following winter was unu&s;ually mild, in&s;omuch that the navigation of the Delaware was not interrupted during the whole &s;ea&s;on, only from the 7th to the 24th of February. The wea|ther on the 3d and 4th days of March was very cold, and on the 8th and 9th days of the &s;ame month, the mercury in Fahrenheit's thermometer &s;tood at 4&deg; at 7 o'clock in the morning. On the 10th and 11th, there fell a deep &s;now. The wea|ther during the remaining part of the month was cold, rainy, and variable. It continued to be vari|able during the month of April. About the mid|dle of the month, there fell an unu&s;ual quantity of rain. The &s;howers which fell on the night of the 17th, will long be connected in the memories of the citizens of Philadelphia with the time of the death of the celebrated Dr. Franklin. Several pleu|ri&s;ies appeared during this month; al&s;o a few ca|&s;es of mea&s;les. In the la&s;t week of the month, the influenza made its appearance. It was brought to the city from New-England, and affected, in its cour&s;e, all the intermediate &s;tates. Its &s;ymp|toms were nearly the &s;ame as they were in the pre|ceding autumn, but in many people it put on &s;ome
<PB N="258" REF="026112_0256_0FCFF2F1B1C48A20">
new appearances. Several per&s;ons who were af|fected by it, had &s;ymptoms of madne&s;s, one of whom de&s;troyed him&s;elf by jumping out of a win|dow. Some had no cough, but very acute pains in the back and head. It was remarked that tho&s;e who had the di&s;ea&s;e chiefly in the brea&s;t the la&s;t year, complained now chiefly of their heads, while tho&s;e who&s;e heads were affected formerly, now complained chiefly of their brea&s;ts. In many, it put on the type of an intermitting fever. Several complained of con&s;tant chills, or con&s;tant &s;weats; and &s;ome were much alarmed by an uncommon blue and dark colour in their hands. I &s;aw one ca&s;e of i&s;churia, another of an acute pain in the rec|tum, a third of ana&s;arca, and a fourth of a pal&s;y in the tongue and arms; all of which appeared to be anomalous &s;ymptoms of the Influenza. Sneezing, and pains in the ears and frontal &s;inus, were le&s;s common now than they were in the fall; but a pain in the eye-balls was an univer&s;al &s;ymptom. Some had a pain in the one eye only, and a few had &s;ore eyes, and &s;wellings in the face. Many women who had it, were affected by an irregular appear|ance of the catamenia. In two per&s;ons whom I &s;aw, the cough was ince&s;&s;ant for three days, nor could it be compo&s;ed by any other remedy than plentiful bleeding. A patient of Dr. Samuel Duf|field's informed me after his recovery, that he had
<PB N="259" REF="026112_0257_0FCFF2F325A9F7C0">
had no other &s;ymptom of the di&s;ea&s;e than an ef|flore&s;cence on his &s;kin, and a large &s;welling in his groin, which terminated in a tedious ab&s;ce&s;s.</P>
<P>THE pri&s;oners in the goal who had it in the autumn, e&s;caped it this &s;pring.</P>
<P>DURING the prevalence of this di&s;order, I &s;aw no &s;ign of any other epidemic.</P>
<P>IT declined &s;en&s;ibly about the fir&s;t week in June, and after the 12th day of this month, I was not called to a &s;ingle patient in this di&s;order.</P>
<P>THE remedies for it were the &s;ame as were u&s;ed in the fall.</P>
<P>I USED bleeding in &s;everal ca&s;es on the &s;econd, third, and fourth days of the di&s;order, where it had appeared to be improper in its fir&s;t &s;tage. The ca&s;es which required bleeding were far from being general. I &s;aw two in&s;tances of &s;yncope of an a|larming nature, after the lo&s;s of ten ounces of blood; and I heard of one in&s;tance of a boy who died in half an hour after this evacuation.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="026112_0258_0FCFF2F495354E58">I REMARKED that purges of all kinds worked more violently than u&s;ual in this di&s;order.</P>
<P>THE convale&s;cence from it was very &s;low, and a general languor appeared to pervade the citi|zens for &s;everal weeks after it left the city.</P>
<P>THE month of December 1790 was extremely and uniformly cold. In the beginning of the month of January 1791, the weather moderated, and continued to be plea&s;ant, till the 17th, on which day the navigation of the Delaware, which had been completely ob&s;tructed by the ice, was opened &s;o as to admit of the arrival of &s;everal ve&s;|&s;els. During the month of December many peo|ple complained of <HI>Colds</HI>; but they were a&s;cribed wholly to the weather. In January four or five per&s;ons in a family were affected by colds at the &s;ame time; which created a &s;u&s;picion of a return of the influenza. This &s;u&s;picion was &s;oon con|firmed by accounts of its prevailing in the neigh|bouring counties of Che&s;ter and Montgomery in Penn&s;ylvania, and in the di&s;tant &s;tates of Virginia and Rhode-I&s;land. It did not affect near &s;o gene|rally as in the two former times of appearance. There was no difference in the method of treating it. While the common inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es of the winter, bore the lancet as u&s;ual, it was remark|ed
<PB N="261" REF="026112_0259_0FCFF2F647896D98">
that patients who were attacked by the influen|za, did not bear bleeding in a greater proportion, or in a larger quantity than in the two former times of its appearance in the city.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this account of the Influenza by the following ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT is as certainly a contagious di&s;ea&s;e as the mea&s;les or &s;mall pox, and exi&s;ts independently of the &s;en&s;ible qualities of the air. This is proved by its prevailing in every &s;pecies of weather, and in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive periods in neighbourhoods, which have been expo&s;ed in the &s;ame in&s;tant to the &s;ame atmo&s;phere; al&s;o by whole families, and the tenants of gaols and ho&s;pitals frequently e&s;caping it. It is not peculiar to the influenza not to be affected by the different &s;tates of the weather. Dr. Patrick Ru&s;&s;el has proved, that the contagion of the plague is equally independent of the influence of the at|mo&s;phere.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE Influenza infects at the greate&s;t di&s;|tance, pa&s;&s;es with the utmo&s;t rapidity through a country, and affects the greate&s;t number of people in a given time, of any contagious di&s;ea&s;e in the world.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="262" REF="026112_0260_0FCFF2F7952E12C8">3. IT appears from the hi&s;tories of it which are upon record, that neither climate, nor the dif|ferent &s;tates of &s;ociety, have produced any <HI>material</HI> change in the di&s;order. This will appear from comparing the account I have given, with the hi&s;tories of it which have lately been given by Dr. Grey, Dr. Hamilton, Dr. A. Fothergill, Mr. Chi&s;holm, and other modern phy&s;icians. It ap|pears further, that even time it&s;elf has not been able materially to change the type of this di&s;order. This is evident, from comparing modern accounts of it with tho&s;e which have been handed down to us by ancient phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>I HAVE hinted in a former e&s;&s;ay at the <HI>diminu|tives</HI> of certain di&s;ea&s;es. There is a &s;pecies of In|fluenza, which is le&s;s violent and more local, than that which has been de&s;cribed. It generally pre|vails in the winter &s;ea&s;on. It &s;eems to originate from a morbid matter, generated in crowded and heated churches, and other a&s;&s;emblies of the peo|ple. I have &s;een a cold, or influenza, frequently univer&s;al in Philadelphia, which I have di&s;tinctly traced to this &s;ource. It would &s;eem as if the &s;ame &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;es re&s;embled pictures, and that while &s;ome of them partook of the deep and vivid nature of mo&s;aic work, others appeared like the feeble and tran&s;ient impre&s;&s;ions of water colours.</P>

<HEAD>AN INQUIRY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been remarked, that Penn&s;ylvania for &s;ome years pa&s;t, has become more &s;ickly than formerly. Fevers, which a few years ago appear|ed chiefly on the banks of creeks and rivers, and in the neighborhood of mill-ponds, now appear in parts remote from them all, and in the highe&s;t &s;i|tuations. This change with re&s;pect to the heal|thine&s;s of our country, may be traced to the three following cau&s;es.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE e&s;tabli&s;hment and increa&s;e of mill-ponds. There are whole counties in Penn&s;ylvania in which
<PB N="266" REF="026112_0263_0FCFF2FE5CA7A9B0">
intermittents were unknown, until the waters in them were dammed, for the purpo&s;e of erecting mill-ponds.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE cutting down of wood, under certain circum&s;tances, tends to render a country &s;ickly. It has been remarked, that intermittents on the &s;hores of the Su&s;quehannah, have kept an exact pace with the pa&s;&s;ages which have been opened for the propagation of mar&s;h effluvia, by cutting down the wood which formerly grew in its neighbour|hood. I remember the time, when intermittents were known only within half a mile, in &s;ome pla|ces, of that river. They are now to be met with ten miles from it, in the &s;ame parts of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>I BEG a di&s;tinction to be made here between <HI>clearing</HI> and <HI>cultivating</HI> a country. While clearing a country makes it &s;ickly, in the manner that has been mentioned, <HI>cultivating</HI> a country, that is, draining &s;wamps, de&s;troying weeds, burning bru&s;h, and ex|haling the unwhol&s;ome and &s;uperfluous moi&s;ture of the earth, by means of frequent crops of grain, gra&s;&s;es, and vegetables of all kinds, render it heal|thy. I could mention, in &s;upport of the&s;e facts, &s;everal countries in the United States, which have pa&s;&s;ed through each of the &s;tages that have been de&s;cribed. The fir&s;t &s;ettlers received the&s;e coun|tries
<PB N="267" REF="026112_0264_0FCFF30394C1B880">
from the hands of nature pure and healthy.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Phy&s;ician who travelled through part of Bedford county, in Penn&s;ylvania, in the year 1782, informed me that he was witne&s;s of &s;ome country people having travel|led twenty miles, to &s;ee whether it was po&s;&s;ible for a Ger|man girl, who laboured under an intermittent, to be HOT and COLD at the &s;ame time. Even the &s;wamps in the Uni|ted States are healthy before they are cleared. In the De|laware State, labourers pa&s;s whole &s;ummers and autumns in making &s;hingles in the cedar &s;wamps, without being af|fected by fevers or &s;ickne&s;s of any kind. Per&s;ons who &s;pend the warm months in the cedar and pine &s;wamps in North-Carolina, are likewi&s;e equally free from di&s;ea&s;es.</NOTE> Fevers &s;oon followed their improvements, nor were they finally bani&s;hed, until the higher degrees of cultivation that have been named took place. I confine my&s;elf to tho&s;e countries only where the &s;alutary effects of cultivation were not rendered abortive by the neighbourhood of mill-ponds.</P>
<P>A third cau&s;e of the late increa&s;e of bilious and intermitting fevers, mu&s;t be &s;ought for in the differ|ent and unequal quantities of rain which have fall|en within the&s;e la&s;t &s;even years. While our creeks and rivers, from the uniformity of our &s;ea&s;ons, were confined to &s;teady bounds, there was little or no exhalation of febrile mia&s;mata from their &s;hores. But the dry &s;ummers of 1780, 1781,
<PB N="268" REF="026112_0265_0FCFF306EE2589A0">
and 1782, by reducing our creeks and rivers far below their ancient marks; while the wet &s;prings of 1784 and 1785, by &s;welling them both beyond their natural heights, have, when they have fall|en, as in the former ca&s;e, left a large and exten&s;ive &s;urface of moi&s;t ground expo&s;ed to the action of the &s;un, and of cour&s;e to the generation and exha|lation of febrile mia&s;mata. The hi&s;tory of epide|mics in foreign countries, favours this opinion of the cau&s;e of their increa&s;e in Penn&s;ylvania. The inhabitants of Egypt are always healthy during the overflowing of the Nile. Their fevers appear only after the rece&s;s of the river. It is remark|able that a wet &s;ea&s;on is often healthy in low, while it is &s;ickly in hilly countries. The rea&s;on is obvi|ous. In the former the rains entirely cover all the moi&s;t grounds, while in the latter, they fall only in &s;ufficient quantity to produce tho&s;e degrees of moi&s;ture which favour febrile exhalations. The rains which fall in the &s;ummer are rendered harm|le&s;s only by covering the <HI>whole</HI> &s;urface of mar&s;hy ground. The rains which fall in our &s;tate after the middle of September, are &s;o far from produ|cing fevers, that they generally prevent them. The extraordinary healthine&s;s of the la&s;t autumn, I believe, was occa&s;ioned by nothing but the ex|traordinary quantity of rain that fell during the autumnal months. The rain probably acts at this
<PB N="269" REF="026112_0266_0FCFF30ABA89AFF0">
&s;ea&s;on by diluting, and thus de&s;troying, the febrile mia&s;mata that were produced by the heat and moi|&s;ture of the preceding &s;ummer. In &s;upport of the truth of this third cau&s;e of the increa&s;e of fe|vers in Penn&s;ylvania, I have only to add a fact lately communicated to me by Dr. Franklin. He informed me, that in his journey from Pa&s;&s;ey to Havre de Grace, la&s;t &s;ummer, he found the coun|try through which he travelled, unu&s;ually &s;ickly with fevers. The&s;e fevers, it was generally &s;up|po&s;ed, were produced by the extrordinary dry weather, of which the public papers have given us &s;uch melancholy and frequent accounts.</P>
<P>I COME now to &s;ugge&s;t a few hints for obviating and preventing fevers, and for rendering our coun|try again healthy. For this purpo&s;e, I beg leave to recommend, in the fir&s;t place, the planting of trees around all our mill ponds, (be&s;ides cleaning them occa&s;ionally) in order to prevent the di&s;ea&s;es that have ju&s;tly been a&s;cribed to them. Let the trees be planted in the greate&s;t number, and clo&s;e&s;t together, to leeward of the ordinary current of the &s;ummer and autumnal winds. I have known &s;everal in&s;tances of families being pre&s;erved from fevers by an accidental cop&s;e of wood &s;tanding between a mill-pond and a dwelling-hou&s;e, and that in ca&s;es too where the hou&s;e deri|ved
<PB N="270" REF="026112_0267_0FCFF30CB416D6C0">
no advantage from an high &s;ituation. The trees <HI>around</HI> or <HI>near</HI> a mill-pond, act perhaps in a &s;mall degree <HI>mechanically.</HI> By &s;heltering the pond from the action of the &s;un, they le&s;&s;en exhalation, as well as ob&s;truct the pa&s;&s;age of the vapors that are rai&s;ed, to the adjacent parts. But they act likewi&s;e <HI>chemically.</HI> It has been demon&s;trated that trees ab&s;orb unhealthy air, and di&s;charge it in a highly purified &s;tate in the form of what is now called "dephlogi&s;ticated" air. The willow tree, according to Mr. Ingenhauzs, has been found to purify air the mo&s;t rapidly of any tree that he has &s;ubjected to his experiments. The ra|pidity of its growth, its early verdure, and the late fall of its leaf, all &s;eem to mark it likewi&s;e as a tree highly proper for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>A SECOND method of preventing fevers, is to let the cultivation always keep pace with the <HI>clear|ing</HI> of our lands. Nature has in this in&s;tance, connected our duty, intere&s;t, and health together. Let every &s;pot covered with moi&s;ture from which the wood has been cut, be carefully drained, and afterwards ploughed and &s;owed with gra&s;s &s;eed; let weeds of all kinds be de&s;troyed, and let the waters be &s;o directed as to prevent their &s;tagnating in any part of their cour&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="026112_0268_0FCFF30E2AC3FF80">THESE are the two principal means of extirpa|ting intermitting and bilious fevers from our coun|try, but as the&s;e means are &s;low in their operation, I &s;hall &s;ubjoin a few directions for preventing fe|vers till the above remedies can take effect.</P>
<P N="1">1. WHETHER the matter which produces fe|vers be of an organic nature, I do not pretend to determine, but it is certain, that <HI>fire,</HI> or the <HI>&s;moke</HI> or <HI>heat</HI> which i&s;&s;ue from it, de&s;troy the effects of mar&s;h mia&s;mata upon the human body; hence we find cities more healthy than country places, and the centre of cities more healthy than their &s;ub|urbs in the &s;ickly months. To derive the utmo&s;t po&s;&s;ible benefit from this method of preventing &s;ickne&s;s, I would advi&s;e large fires to be made every evening, of bru&s;h, between the &s;pots from whence the exhalations are derived, and the dwelling hou&s;e, and as near to the latter as is &s;afe, and not di&s;agreeable. This practice &s;hould be continued till the appearance of two or three fro&s;ts, for fro&s;ts, as well as heavy rains in the autumnal months, ne|ver fail to put a &s;top to the progre&s;s of intermit|tents.</P>
<P>DURING the &s;ickly &s;ea&s;on, fires &s;hould be like|wi&s;e kept in every room in the dwelling hou&s;e, even in tho&s;e ca&s;es where the heat of the weather
<PB N="272" REF="026112_0269_0FCFF312C96CF2D8">
makes it nece&s;&s;ary to keep the doors and windows open.</P>
<P N="2">2. LET me advi&s;e my countrymen in &s;ickly &s;itu|ations, to prefer woollen and cotton to linen clothes in the &s;ummer and autumnal months. The mo&s;t &s;ickly parts of the i&s;land of Jamaica have been ren|dered more healthy, &s;ince the inhabitants have adopted the u&s;e of woollen and cotton garments in&s;tead of linen.</P>
<P>DURING the late war, I knew many officers, both in the Briti&s;h and American armies, who e&s;ca|ped fevers in the mo&s;t &s;ickly places, by wearing woollen &s;hirts or wai&s;tcoats con&s;tantly next to their &s;kins. I have heard the pre&s;ent diminution of the human body in &s;trength and &s;ize, compared with its ancient vigor and form, a&s;cribed in part to the introduction of linen garments. I am not di&s;po&s;ed to controvert this opinion, but I am &s;ure of the efficacy of woollen clothes in wet and cold climates in preventing fevers of all kinds. The parliament of Great Britain compels every body that dies within the i&s;land to be buried in a woollen &s;hirt or winding &s;heet. The law would be much wi&s;er if it compelled every body to wear woollen garments next to their &s;kins during life, and linen after death.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="273" REF="026112_0270_0FCFF318C4B5DF20">3. THE diet in the &s;ickly months &s;hould be ge|nerous. Wine and beer &s;hould be the drinks of this &s;ea&s;on in&s;tead of &s;pirits and water. I do not think that fruit and vegetables of any kind produce fevers, but as the &s;ea&s;on of the year produces lan|guor and weakne&s;s, a larger quantity of animal food than u&s;ual is be&s;t calculated to oppo&s;e them. Salt|ed meat, for this rea&s;on, is preferable to fre&s;h meat. Food of all kinds eaten during the &s;ickly months, &s;hould be well &s;ea&s;oned.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE evening air &s;hould be avoided as much as po&s;&s;ible. Even the morning air before the &s;un ri&s;es, &s;hould not be breathed, until the body has been fortified with a little &s;olid aliment, or a <HI>draught</HI> of bitters. The&s;e bitters &s;hould be made of centaury, wormwood, camomile, or the bark of the willow or dogwood trees infu&s;ed in <HI>water.</HI> Bit|ters made with &s;pirits, or even wine, cannot be taken in a &s;ufficient quantity to do &s;ervice without producing intoxication, or the deadly habit of lov|ing and drinking &s;pirituous liquors.</P>
<P N="5">5. TOO much cannot be &s;aid in favour of clean|line&s;s, as means of preventing fevers. The body &s;hould be bathed or wa&s;hed frequently. It has been proved in the highlands of Jamaica, that add|ing &s;alt to water, renders it more powerful in pre|venting
<PB N="274" REF="026112_0271_0FCFF31B3AB6FD98">
di&s;ea&s;es when applied to the body. Equal pains &s;hould be taken to promote cleanline&s;s in every &s;pecies of apparel. Offal matters, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which are of a vegetable nature, &s;hould be removed from the neighbourhood of a dwelling hou&s;e. The dung of dome&s;tic animals, during its progre&s;s towards manure may be excepted from this direction. Nature, which made man and the&s;e animals equally nece&s;&s;ary to each others &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence, has kindly prevented any inconvenience from their living together. On the contrary, to repay the hu&s;bandman for affording a &s;helter to the&s;e u&s;eful and helple&s;s animals, nature has done more. She has endowed their dung with a power of de&s;troying the effects of mar&s;h exhalations, and of preventing fevers. The mi&s;erable cottagers in Europe who live under the &s;ame roof, and in &s;ome in&s;tances in the &s;ame room with their cattle, are always healthy. In Philadelphia, fevers are le&s;s known in the neighbourhood of livery &s;tables, than in any other part of the city. I could mention a family that has lived near thirty years near a livery &s;table in a &s;ickly part of the city, that has never known a fever but from the mea&s;les or &s;mall-pox.</P>

<P>HOWEVER trifling the&s;e complaints may appear, they compo&s;e a large cla&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;es of a numerous body of people. Hi|therto the per&s;ons afflicted by them have been too generally abandoned to the care of empirics, either becau&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e was con&s;idered as beneath the notice of phy&s;icians, or becau&s;e they were unable to cure it. I would rather a&s;cribe it to the latter, than to the former cau&s;e, for pride has no natural fellow&s;hip with the profe&s;&s;ion of medicine.</P>
<P>THE difficulty of curing &s;ore legs has been con|fe&s;&s;ed by phy&s;icians in every country. As far as my ob&s;ervations have extended, I am di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;|cribe this difficulty to the uniform and indi&s;crimi|nate
<PB N="278" REF="026112_0274_0FCFF32026315BE8">
mode of treating them, occa&s;ioned by the want of a theory which &s;hall explain their proxi|mate cau&s;e. I &s;hall attempt in a few pages to de|liver one, which however imperfect, will I hope lay a foundation for more &s;ucce&s;sful inquiries upon this &s;ubject hereafter.</P>
<P>I SHALL begin my ob&s;ervations upon this di&s;|order, by delivering and &s;upporting the following propo&s;itions.</P>
<P N="1">I. SORE LEGS are a di&s;ea&s;e of general debility, which, for the mo&s;t part, is of the indirect kind. This I infer from the occupations and habits of the per&s;ons who are mo&s;t &s;ubject to them. They are day-labourers, and &s;ailors, who are in the habit of lift|ing great weights; al&s;o wa&s;her-women, and all other per&s;ons, who pa&s;s the greate&s;t part of their time upon their feet. The blood ve&s;&s;els, and mu&s;cular fibres of the legs are thus over&s;tretched, by which means either a rupture, or &s;uch a lan|guid action in the ve&s;&s;els is induced, as that an ac|cidental wound from any cau&s;e, even from the &s;cratch of a pin or the bite of a mo&s;quito, will not ea&s;ily heal. But labourers, &s;ailors, and wa&s;her-women, are not the only per&s;ons who are afflicted with &s;ore legs. Hard-drinkers of every rank and de&s;cription are likewi&s;e &s;ubject to them. Where
<PB N="279" REF="026112_0275_0FCFF32329322868">
&s;trong drink, labour, and &s;tanding long on the feet are united, they more certainly di&s;po&s;e to &s;ore legs, than when they act &s;eparately. In China, where the labour which is performed by brutes in other countries is performed by men, varices on the legs are very common among the labouring people. Perhaps, the rea&s;on why the debility induced in the legs produces varices in&s;tead of ulcers in the&s;e people, may be owing to their not adding the de|bilitating &s;timulus of &s;trong drink to that of exce&s;|&s;ive labour.</P>
<P>IT is not extraordinary that the indirect debi|lity produced by intemperance in drinking ardent &s;pirits, &s;hould appear fir&s;t in the lower extremities. The indirect debility produced by intemperance in the u&s;e of wine, makes its fir&s;t appearance in the form of gout, in the &s;ame part of the body. The gout, it is true, di&s;covers it&s;elf mo&s;t frequently in pain only, but there are ca&s;es in which it has terminated in ulcers, and even mortifications on the legs.</P>
<P N="2">II. SORE LEGS are a di&s;ea&s;e of the whole &s;y|&s;tem. This I infer,</P>
<P N="1">1. From the cau&s;es which induce them, all of
<PB N="280" REF="026112_0276_0FCFF3249E09E160">
which act more or le&s;s upon every part of the body.</P>
<P N="2">2. FROM their following or preceding di&s;ea&s;es which obviou&s;ly belong to the whole &s;y&s;tem. Fe|vers and dy&s;enteries often terminate critically in this di&s;order; and the pulmonary con&s;umption and apoplexy have often been preceded by the &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion of an habitual di&s;charge from a &s;ore leg. The two latter di&s;ea&s;es have been a&s;cribed to the tran&s;lation of a morbific matter to the lungs or brain: But it is more rational to a&s;cribe them to a previous debility in tho&s;e organs, by which means their ve&s;|&s;els were more ea&s;ily excited into action and effu|&s;ion by the &s;timulus of the plethora, induced upon the &s;y&s;tem in con&s;equence of the confinement of the fluids formerly di&s;charged from the leg in the form of pus. This plethora can do harm only where there is previous debility; for I maintain that the &s;y&s;tem (when the &s;olids are exactly toned) will always relieve it&s;elf of a &s;udden preternatural accumulation of fluids by means of &s;ome natural emunctory. This has been often ob&s;erved in the menorrhagia, which accompanies plentiful living in women, and in the copious di&s;charges from the bowels and kidneys which follow a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the per&s;piration.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="281" REF="026112_0277_0FCFF3261F53AF10">3. I INFER it, from their appearing almo&s;t uni|ver&s;ally in one di&s;ea&s;e, which is evidently a di&s;ea&s;e of the whole &s;y&s;tem, viz. the &s;curvy.</P>
<P N="4">4. FROM their becoming in &s;ome ca&s;es the out|lets of men&s;trual blood, which is di&s;charged in con|&s;equence of a plethora which affects more or le&s;s every part of the female &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P N="5">5. I INFER it from the <HI>&s;ymptoms</HI> of &s;ore legs, which are in &s;ome ca&s;es febrile, and affect the pul&s;e in every part of the body with preternatural fre|quency or force. The&s;e &s;ymptoms were witne&s;&s;ed, in an eminent degree, in two of the patients who furni&s;hed &s;ubjects for clinical remarks in the Penn|&s;ylvania ho&s;pital in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t winter.</P>
<P N="6">6. I INFER that &s;ore legs are a di&s;ea&s;e of the whole &s;y&s;tem, from the manner in which they are &s;ometimes cured by nature and art. They often prove the outlets of many general di&s;ea&s;es, and all the remedies which cure them, act more or le&s;s up|on the whole &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>IN all ca&s;es of &s;ore legs there is a tonic and atonic &s;tate of the whole &s;y&s;tem. The &s;ame &s;tate of ex|ce&s;&s;ive or deficient action takes place in the parts
<PB N="282" REF="026112_0278_0FCF4946D1CAFE20">
which are affected by the &s;ores. The remedies to cure them, therefore, &s;hould be <HI>general</HI> and <HI>local.</HI></P>
<P>IN ca&s;es where the arterial &s;y&s;tem is affected by too much tone, the general remedies &s;hould be,</P>
<P N="1">I. BLOOD-LETTING. Of the efficacy of this remedy in di&s;po&s;ing ulcers &s;uddenly to heal, the two clinical patients beforementioned, exhibited re|markable proofs la&s;t winter, in the pre&s;ence of all the &s;tudents of medicine in the univer&s;ity. The blood drawn was &s;izy in both ca&s;es. I have not the merit of having introduced this remedy into practice in the cure of ulcers. I learned it from Sir John Pringle. I have known it to be u&s;ed with equal &s;ucce&s;s in a &s;ore brea&s;t, attended by pain and inflam|mation, after all the u&s;ual remedies for that di&s;order had been u&s;ed to no purpo&s;e. I anticipate here a repetition of an objection to this remedy by per|&s;ons who cannot, at fir&s;t &s;ight, reconcile exce&s;&s;ive action in the arterial &s;y&s;tem with the debility which predi&s;po&s;es to it. I refer the reader for a defence of it, to what was &s;aid upon the &s;ubject of bleeding in the inflammatory &s;pecies of con&s;umption. It will only be nece&s;&s;ary to add in this place, that indirect, like direct debility, when of &s;hort duration, never fails to produce &s;uch a degree of excitability, or vibratility (if I may be allowed to coin a word) in

<P N="1">I. COLD water. Dr. Rigby has written largely in favour of this remedy when applied to local in|flammations. From its good effects in allaying the inflammation which &s;ometimes follows the punc|ture which is made in the arm in communicating the &s;mall pox, and from the &s;udden relief it affords in the inflammatory &s;pecies of the ophthalmia and in the piles, no one can doubt of its efficacy in &s;ore legs, accompanied by inflammation in tho&s;e ve&s;|&s;els, which are the immediate &s;eat of the di&s;order.</P>

He directs us fir&s;t to boil the milk, then to powder the bread, and throw it into the milk, and after they have been intimately mixed, by being well &s;tirred and boiled together, they &s;hould be poured out and &s;pread upon a rag, and a knife dipped in &s;weet oil or lard, &s;hould be run over them. The &s;olidity and con|&s;i&s;tence of the poultice is hereby better pre&s;erved, than when the oil or lard is mixed with the bread and milk over the fire.</P>
<P N="3">III. When the inflammation &s;ub&s;ides, dry lint &s;hould be applied to the &s;ore, and confined by means of a &s;oft pla&s;ter of wax and &s;weet oil.</P>
<P N="4">IV. ABOVE all, re&s;t, and an horizontal po&s;ture of the leg. Too much cannot be &s;aid in favor of this re|medy in this &s;pecies of &s;ore legs. Nannoni, the fa|mous Italian &s;urgeon, &s;ums up the cure of &s;ore legs in three words, viz. "Tempo, ripo&s;o, e pazienza;" that is, in time, re&s;t and patience. A friend of mine, who was cured by this &s;urgeon, of a &s;ore leg, about thirty years ago, informed me, that he confined him to his bed, during the greate&s;t part of the time that he was under his care.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="026112_0281_0FCFF32A92F27E90">IN &s;ore legs, attended by too little general and local action, the following remedies are proper.</P>
<P N="1">I. BARK. It &s;hould be u&s;ed plentifully, but with a con&s;tant reference to the &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem; for the changes in the weather, and other acciden|tal circum&s;tances often produce &s;uch changes in the &s;y&s;tem, as to render its di&s;u&s;e for a &s;hort time fre|quently nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P N="2">II. MERCURY. This remedy has been &s;uppo&s;|ed to act by altering the fluids, or by di&s;charging a morbid matter from them, in curing &s;ore legs. But this is by no means the ca&s;e. It appears to act as an univer&s;al &s;timulant; and if it prove mo&s;t u&s;eful when it excites a &s;alivation, it is only becau&s;e in this way it excites the mo&s;t general action in the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P N="3">III MINERAL TONICS&mdash;&s;uch as the different preparations of iron, copper, and zinc.</P>
<P N="4">IV. GENTLE EXERCISE. Re&s;t, and a recum|bent po&s;ture of the body, &s;o proper in the tonic, are both hurtful in this &s;pecies of &s;ore legs. The efficacy of exerci&s;e, even of the active kind, in the cure of &s;ore legs, accompanied by deficient ac|tion in the ve&s;&s;els, may ea&s;ily be conceived from
<PB N="286" REF="026112_0282_0FCFF32C1893AFE0">
its good effects after gun-&s;hot wounds which are mentioned by Dr. Jack&s;on.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Medical Journal, 1790.</NOTE> He tells us, that tho&s;e Briti&s;h &s;oldiers who had been wounded at the battle of Guilford, in North-Carolina, who were turned out of the military ho&s;pitals and fol|lowed the army, &s;oone&s;t recovered of their wounds. It was remarkable that if they delayed only a few days on the road, their wounds grew wor&s;e, or cea&s;ed to heal.</P>
<P>IN the u&s;e of the different &s;pecies of exerci&s;e the &s;ame regard &s;hould be had to the &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem which was recommended in a former di&s;order.</P>
<P N="5">V. A NUTRITIOUS and moderately &s;timulating diet, con&s;i&s;ting of milk, &s;accharine vegetables, ani|mal food, malt-liquors, and wine.</P>
<P>WORT has done great &s;ervice in &s;ore legs. I am at a lo&s;s to determine whether it acts by con|veying a quantity of gently &s;timulating and nutri|tious matter into the &s;y&s;tem, or by correcting a &s;corbutic diathe&s;is in the blood. The manner in which I have directed it to be prepared and taken is as follows&mdash;To three or four <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> table-&s;poonsful of the malt, finely powdered and &s;ifted,
<PB N="287" REF="026112_0283_0FCFF32DDEFB1B48">
add two table &s;poonsful of brown &s;ugar, and three or four of Madeira, Sherry, or Li&s;bon wine, and a quart of boiling water. After they have &s;tood a few hours, it may be drunken liberally by the pa|tient, &s;tirring it each time before he takes it, &s;o that the whole &s;ub&s;tance of the malt may be conveyed into the &s;tomach. A little lime-juice may be ad|ded, if the patient requires it, to make it more plea&s;ant. The above quantity may be taken once, twice, or three times a day at the plea&s;ure of the patient, or according to the indication of his di&s;|order.</P>
<P N="5">VI. OPIUM. This remedy is not only u&s;eful in ea&s;ing the pain of a &s;ore leg, but co-operates with other cordial medicines in invigorating the whole &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>THE <HI>local</HI> applications &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances as are gently e&s;carotic, and which excite an action in the torpid ve&s;&s;els of the affected part. Ar&s;enic, precipitate, and blue vitriol, have all been employed with &s;ucce&s;s for this purpo&s;e. Dr. Grif|fitts informed me, that he has frequently accom|pli&s;hed the &s;ame thing in the Di&s;pen&s;ary by ap|plications of tartar emetic. They &s;hould all be u&s;ed, if nece&s;&s;ary, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to each other; for there is often the &s;ame idio&s;yncra&s;y in a &s;ore leg to cer|tain topical applications, that there is in the &s;to|mach
<PB N="288" REF="026112_0284_0FCFF32FCDD0D998">
to certain aliments. After the u&s;e of the&s;e remedies, a&s;tringents and tonics &s;hould be applied, &s;uch as an infu&s;ion of Peruvian, or white-oak bark; the water in which the &s;miths extingui&s;h their irons, lime-water, bread dipped in a weak &s;olution of green vitriol (&s;o much commended by Dr. Un|derwood) and compre&s;&s;es wetted with brandy, or ardent &s;pirits of any kind.</P>
<P>TIGHT bandages are likewi&s;e highly proper here. The laced &s;tocking has been much u&s;ed. It is made of &s;trong coar&s;e linen. Dr. Underwood gives &s;everal good rea&s;ons for preferring a flannel roller to the linen &s;tocking. It &s;ets ea&s;ier on the leg, and yields to the &s;welling of the mu&s;cles in walking.</P>
<P>IN &s;corbutic &s;ores on the legs, navy &s;urgeons have &s;poken in high terms of an application of a mixture of lime-juice and mela&s;&s;es. Mr. Gille&s;pie commends the u&s;e of lime or lemon-juice alone, and a&s;cribes many cures to it in the Briti&s;h navy during the late war, after every common application had been u&s;ed to no purpo&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Medical Journal, Vol. VI.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence in the treatment of &s;ore legs, to keep them clean, by frequent dre&s;&s;ings
<PB N="289" REF="026112_0285_0FCFF3355460B878">
and wa&s;hings. The &s;ucce&s;s of old women is oftener derived from their great attention to cleanline&s;s, in the management of &s;ore legs, than to any &s;pecifics they po&s;&s;e&s;s which are unknown to phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>WHEN &s;ore legs are kept from healing by affec|tions of the bone, the treatment &s;hould be &s;uch as is recommended by practical writers on &s;urgery.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this inquiry by four ob&s;erva|tions, which are naturally &s;ugge&s;ted by what has been delivered upon this di&s;order.</P>
<P N="1">1. IF it has been proved that &s;ore legs are, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, di&s;ea&s;es of the whole &s;y&s;tem, is it not proper to inquire, whether many other di&s;ea&s;es &s;uppo&s;ed to be local are not in like manner di&s;ea&s;es of the whole &s;y&s;tem? And if &s;ore legs have been cured by general remedies, is it not proper to u&s;e them more frequently in other local di&s;ea&s;es?&mdash; I am led to make this remark by having &s;een two in&s;tances of tumors, the one on the brea&s;t, and the other in the pro&s;tate gland, nearly cured by long journies.</P>
<P N="2">2. IF there be two &s;tates of action in the arteries in &s;ore legs, it becomes us to inquire, whether the &s;ame oppo&s;ite &s;tates of action do not take place in many di&s;ea&s;es in which they are not &s;u&s;pected. I have
<PB N="290" REF="026112_0286_0FCFF3369464CF58">
before ob&s;erved, that they occur in the &s;crofula. It would be ea&s;y to prove, that they exi&s;t in &s;eve|ral other local di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P N="3">3. IF the efficacy of the remedies for &s;ore legs which have been mentioned, depends upon their being accommodated exactly to the &s;tate of the ar|terial &s;y&s;tem, and if this &s;y&s;tem be liable to fre|quent changes, does it not become us to be more attentive to the &s;tate of the pul&s;e in this di&s;order than is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to be nece&s;&s;ary by phy&s;icians?&mdash;Indeed, if one of the principles I have aimed to e&s;tabli&s;h in this and &s;everal of the foregoing e&s;&s;ays be ju&s;t, that is, that all pre&s;crip|tions &s;hould be &s;uited to the <HI>&s;tate,</HI> and not to the <HI>name,</HI> of a di&s;ea&s;e, it follows that &s;ucce&s;s in the practice of phy&s;ic will depend chiefly upon the oc|ca&s;ional change of the do&s;e, or quality of a medi|cine with the changing &s;tate of the whole &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P N="4">4. IT has been a misfortune in medicine, as well as in other &s;ciences, for men to a&s;cribe ef|fects to one cau&s;e, which &s;hould be a&s;cribed to many. Hence di&s;ea&s;es have been attributed ex|clu&s;ively to morbid affections of the fluids by &s;ome, and of the mu&s;cles, and nerves by others. Unfor|fortunately the morbid &s;tates of the arterial &s;y&s;tem, and the influence of tho&s;e &s;tates upon the brain&mdash;
<PB N="291" REF="026112_0287_0FCFF33A45FC64F8">
the nerves&mdash;the mu&s;cles&mdash;the lymphatics&mdash;the glands&mdash;the vi&s;cera&mdash;the alimentary canal&mdash;and the &s;kin, as well as the reciprocal influence of the morbid &s;tates of each of tho&s;e parts of the body upon the arteries, and upon each other, have been too much neglected in mo&s;t of our &s;y&s;tems of phy|&s;ic. I con&s;ider the pathology of the arterial &s;y&s;tem as a mine. It was fir&s;t di&s;covered by Dr. Cullen. The man who attempts to explore it, will probably impoveri&s;h him&s;elf by his re&s;earches; but the men who come after him, will certainly obtain from it a trea&s;ure which cannot fail of adding greatly to the riches of medicine.</P>

<P>MOST of the facts which I &s;hall deliver upon this &s;ubject, are the re&s;ult of ob&s;ervations made during the la&s;t five years, upon per&s;ons of both &s;exes, who had pa&s;&s;ed the 80th year of their lives.

I &s;hall, therefore, only deliver the facts and principles which are the re&s;ult of the inquiries and ob&s;erva|tions I have made upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="296" REF="026112_0290_0FCF49302E6A1868">I. I SHALL Mention the circum&s;tances which favour the attainment of longevity.</P>

<P N="3">III. I SHALL enumerate its peculiar di&s;ea&s;es, and the remedies which are mo&s;t proper to remove, or moderate them.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE circum&s;tances which favour longevity, are,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>De&s;cent from long-lived Ance&s;tors.</HI> I have not found a &s;ingle in&s;tance of a per&s;on, who has lived to be 80 years old, in whom this was not the ca&s;e. In &s;ome in&s;tances I found the de&s;cent was only from one, but in general, it was from both parents. The knowledge of this fa&s;t may &s;erve, not only to a&s;&s;i&s;t in calculating what are called the chances of lives, but it may be made u&s;eful to a phy&s;ician. He may learn from it to cheri&s;h hopes of his patients in chronic, and in &s;ome acute di&s;|ea&s;es, in proportion to the capacity of life they have derived from their ance&s;tors.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Franklin, who died in his 84th year, was de&s;cend|ed from long-lived parents. His father died at 89, and his mother at 87. His father had 17 children by two wives. The Doctor informed me that he once &s;at down as one of 11 adult &s;ons and daughters at his father's table. In an excur|&s;ion he once made to that part of England from whence his family migrated to America, he di&s;covered in a grave-yard, the tomb-&s;tones of &s;everal per&s;ons of his name, who had li|ved to be very old. The&s;e per&s;ons he &s;uppo&s;ed to have been his ance&s;tors.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="297" REF="026112_0291_0FCFF1FE32D31FA8">2. <HI>Temperance in Eating and Drinking.</HI> To this remark I found &s;everal exceptions. I met with one man of 84 years of age, who had been intem|perate in eating; and four or five per&s;ons who had been intemperate in drinking ardent &s;pirits. They had all been day-labourers, or had deferred drink|ing until they began to feel the languor of old age. I did not meet with a &s;ingle per&s;on who had not, for the la&s;t forty or fifty years of their lives, u&s;ed tea, coffee, and bread and butter twice a day as part of their diet. I am di&s;po&s;ed to believe that tho&s;e articles of diet do not materially affect the duration of human life, although they evidently impair the &s;trength of the &s;y&s;tem. The duration of life does not appear to depend &s;o much upon the &s;trength of the body, or upon the quantity of its excitability, as upon an exact accommodation of &s;timuli to each of them. A watch &s;pring will la&s;t as long as an anchor, provided the forces which
<PB N="298" REF="026112_0292_0FCFF20010340E58">
are capable of de&s;troying both, are always in an exact ratio to their &s;trength. The u&s;e of tea and coffee in diet &s;eems to be happily &s;uited to the change which has taken place in the human body, by &s;edentary occupations, by which means le&s;s nou|ri&s;hment and &s;timulus are required than formerly, to &s;upport animal life.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE <HI>Moderate exerci&s;e of the Under&s;tanding.</HI> It has long been an e&s;tabli&s;hed truth, that literary men (other circum&s;tances being equal) are longer lived than other people. But it is not nece&s;&s;ary that the under&s;tanding &s;hould be employed upon philo&s;ophical &s;ubjects to produce this influence upon human life. Bu&s;ine&s;s, politics, and religion, which are the objects of attention of men of all cla&s;&s;es, impart a vigour to the under&s;tanding, which, by being conveyed to every part of the body, tends to produce health and long life.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Equanimity of temper.</HI> The violent and ir|regular action of the pa&s;&s;ions tends to wear away the &s;prings of life.</P>
<P>PERSONS who live upon annuities in Europe have been ob&s;erved to be longer lived, in equal circum&s;tances, than other people. This is pro|bably occa&s;ioned by their being exempted, by the certainty of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from tho&s;e fears of
<PB N="299" REF="026112_0293_0FCFF20214442BE0">
want which &s;o frequently di&s;tract the minds, and thereby weaken the bodies of old people. Life-rents have been &s;uppo&s;ed to have the &s;ame i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">+ence in prolonging life. Perhaps the <HI>de&s;ire of life,</HI> in order to enjoy for as long a time as po&s;&s;i|ble, that property which cannot be enjoyed a &s;e|cond time by a child or relation, may be another cau&s;e of the longevity of per&s;ons who live upon certain incomes. It is a fact, that the de&s;ire of life is a very powerful &s;timulus in prolonging it, e&s;pecially when that de&s;ire is &s;upported by hope. This is obvious to phy&s;icians every day. De&s;pair of recovery, is the beginning of death in all di&s;|ea&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT obvious and rea&s;onable as the effects of equanimity of temper are upon human life, there are &s;ome exceptions in favor of pa&s;&s;ionate men and women having attained to a great age. The morbid &s;timulus of anger, in the&s;e ca&s;es, was pro|bably obviated by le&s;s degrees, or le&s;s active exer|ci&s;es of the under&s;tanding, or by the defect, or weakne&s;s of &s;ome of the other &s;timuli which keep up the motions of life.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Matrimony.</HI> In the cour&s;e of my inquiries, I met with only one per&s;on beyond eighty years of age who had never been married.&mdash;I met with &s;everal women who had borne from 10
<PB N="300" REF="026112_0294_0FCFF2034A005938">
to 20 children, and &s;uckled them all. I met with one woman, a native of Hereford&s;hire in England, who is now in the 100th year of her age, who bore a child at 60, men&s;truated till 80, and fre|quently &s;uckled two of her children (though born in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to each other) at the &s;ame time. She had pa&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t part of her life over a wa&s;hing-tub.</P>
<P N="6">6. I HAVE not found <HI>Sedentary Employments</HI> to prevent long life, where they are not ac|companied by intemperance in eating or drink|ing. This ob&s;ervation is not confined to literary men, nor to women only, in whom longevity with|out much exerci&s;e of body has been frequently ob|&s;erved. I met with one in&s;tance of a weaver; a &s;econd of a &s;ilver-&s;mith; and a third of a &s;hoe|maker, among the number of old people, who&s;e hi&s;tories have &s;ugge&s;ted the&s;e ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P N="7">7. I HAVE not found that <HI>acute,</HI> nor that all <HI>chronic</HI> di&s;ea&s;es &s;horten human life. Dr. Franklin had two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive vomicas in his lungs before he was 40 years old. I met with one man beyond 80, who had &s;urvived a mo&s;t violent attack of the yellow fever; a &s;econd who had had &s;everal of his bones fractured by falls, and in frays: and many who had been frequently affected by intermittents.

This circum|&s;tance is the more remarkable as he pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal years at &s;ea when a young man.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The venerable old man, who&s;e hi&s;tory fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted this remark, was born in New-York in the year 1684&mdash; His grandfather lived to be 101, but was unable to walk for thirty years before he died, from an exce&s;&s;ive quantity of fat. His mother died at 91. His con&s;tant drinks were wa|ter, beer, and cyder. He had a fixed di&s;like to &s;pirits of all kinds. His appetite was good, and he ate plentifully during the la&s;t years of his life. He &s;eldom drank any thing be|tween his meals. He was never intoxicated but twice in his life, and that was when a boy, and at &s;ea, where he remembers perfectly well to have celebrated by a feu de joye the birth day of Queen Ann. He was formerly afflicted with the head-ach, and giddine&s;s, but never had a fever, except from the &s;mall-pox, in the cour&s;e of his life. His pul&s;e was &s;low, but regular. He had been twice married. By his fir&s;t wife he had 8, and by his &s;econd 17 children. One of them lived to be 83 years of age. He was about five feet nine inches in height, of a &s;lender make, and carried an <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> to the la&s;t year of his life</NOTE> The&s;e facts may &s;erve to extend our ideas of the importance

of a healthy &s;tate of the &s;tomach in the animal oeco|nomy; and thereby to add to our knowledge in the progno&s;is of di&s;ea&s;es, and in the choices of human life.</P>
<P N="8">8. I HAVE not found the <HI>lo&s;s of teeth</HI> to affect the duration of human life, &s;o much as might be ex|pected. Edward Drinker, who lived to be 103 years old, lo&s;t his teeth thirty years before he di|ed from drawing the hot &s;moke of tobacco into his mouth through a &s;hort pipe.</P>
<P>DR. SAYRE, of New-Jer&s;ey, to whom I am in|debted for &s;everal very valuable hi&s;tories of old per&s;ons, mentions one man aged 81, who&s;e teeth began to decay at 16, and another of 90, who lo&s;t his teeth thirty years before he &s;aw him. The
<PB N="303" REF="026112_0297_0FCFF20E0B893B58">
gums, by becoming hard, perform, in part, the office of teeth: But may not the ga&s;tric juice of the &s;tomach, like the tears and urine, become acrid by age, and thereby &s;upply, by a more di&s;&s;olving power, the defect of ma&s;tication from the lo&s;s of teeth? Analogies might ea&s;ily be adduced from &s;everal operations of nature, which go forward in the animal oeconomy, which render this &s;uppo&s;i|tion highly probable.</P>
<P N="9">9. I HAVE not ob&s;erved <HI>Baldne&s;s,</HI> or <HI>Grey Hairs,</HI> occurring in early or middle life, to prevent old age. In one of the hi&s;tories furni&s;hed me by Dr. Sayre, I find an account of a man of 81, who&s;e hair began to a&s;&s;ume a &s;ilver colour when he was only one and twenty years of age.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this head by the following remark&mdash;</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING there appears in the human body a certain capacity of long life, which &s;eems to di&s;po&s;e it to pre&s;erve its exi&s;tence in every &s;itu|ation; yet this capacity does not always protect it from premature de&s;truction; for among the old peo|ple whom I examined, I &s;carcely met with one who had not lo&s;t brothers or &s;i&s;ters, in early and middle

life, who were born under circum&s;tances equally favourable to longevity with them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="2">II. I COME now to mention &s;ome of the phae|nomena of the body and mind which occur in old age.</P>
<P N="1">1. THERE is a great &s;en&s;ibility to <HI>cold</HI> in all old people. I met with an old woman of 84, who &s;lept con&s;tantly under three blankets and a coverlit du|ring the hotte&s;t &s;ummer months. The &s;ervant of prince de Beaufremont, who came from Mount Jura to Paris at the age of 121, to pay his re&s;pects to the fir&s;t national a&s;&s;embly of France, &s;hivered with cold in the middle of the dog days, when he was not near a good fire. The national a&s;&s;embly directed him to &s;it with his hat on, in order to de|fend his head from the cold.</P>
<P N="2">2. IMPRESSIONS made upon the <HI>ears</HI> of old people, excite &s;en&s;ation and reflexion much quicker than when they are made upon their eyes. Mr. Hutton informed me, that he had frequently met his &s;ons in the &s;treet without knowing them until they had &s;poken to him. Dr. Franklin informed me that he rcognized his friends, after a long ab|&s;ence from them, fir&s;t by their voices. This fact
<PB N="305" REF="026112_0299_0FCFF2115A8F6488">
does not contradict the common opinion, upon the &s;ubject of memory, for the recollection in the&s;e in&s;tances, is the effect of what is called remini&s;cence, which differs from memory in being excited only by the renewal of the impre&s;&s;ion which at fir&s;t pro|duced the idea which is revived.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE <HI>appetite</HI> for food is generally increa&s;ed in old age. The famous Parr, who died at 152, ate heartily in the la&s;t week of his life. The kindne&s;s of nature, in providing this la&s;t portion of earthly enjoyments for old people, de&s;erves to be noticed. It is remarkable, that they have, like children, a frequent recurrence of appetite, and &s;u&s;tain with great unea&s;ine&s;s the intervals of regular meals. The ob&s;ervation, therefore, made by Hippocrates, that middle-aged people are more affected by ab|&s;tinence than tho&s;e who are old, is not true. This might ea&s;ily be proved by many appeals to the re|cords of medicine; but old people differ from children, in preferring <HI>&s;olid</HI> to liquid aliment. From inattention to this fact, Dr. Mead has done great mi&s;chief by advi&s;ing old people, as their teeth decayed or peri&s;hed, to le&s;&s;en the quantity of their &s;olid, and to increa&s;e the quantity of their liquid food. This advice is contrary to nature, and experience, and I have heard of two old per|&s;ons who de&s;troyed them&s;elves by following it. The circulation of the blood is &s;upported in old
<PB N="306" REF="026112_0300_0FCFF21480A4EEA8">
people chiefly by the &s;timulus of aliment. The action of liquids of all kinds upon the &s;y&s;tem is weak, and of &s;hort continuance, compared with the durable &s;timulus of &s;olid food. There is a gradation in the action of this food upon the body. Animal matters are preferred to vegetable; the fat of meat, to the lean, and &s;alted meat to fre&s;h, by mo&s;t old people. I have met with but few old people who retained an appetite for milk. It is remarkable, that a le&s;s quantity of <HI>&s;trong drink</HI> produces intoxication in old people than in per&s;ons in the middle of life. This depends upon the re|currence of the &s;ame &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem, with re|&s;pect to excitability, which takes place in childhood. Many old people, from an ignorance of this fact, have made &s;hipwreck of characters which have commanded re&s;pect in every previous &s;tage of their lives. From the &s;ame recurrence of the excitability of childhood in their &s;y&s;tems, they commonly drink their tea and coffee much weaker than in early or middle life.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE <HI>pul&s;e</HI> is generally full, and frequently affected by pau&s;es in its pul&s;ations when felt in the wri&s;ts of old people. A regular pul&s;e in &s;uch per|&s;ons indicates a di&s;ea&s;e, as it &s;hews the &s;y&s;tem to be under the impre&s;&s;ion of a preternatural &s;timulus of &s;ome kind. This ob&s;ervation was &s;ugge&s;ted to me
<PB N="307" REF="026112_0301_0FCFF2166B328478">
above twenty years ago by Morgagni, and I have often profited by it in attending old people. The pul&s;e in &s;uch patients is an uncertain mark of the na|ture or degree of an acute di&s;ea&s;e. It &s;eldom partakes of the quickne&s;s or convul&s;ive action of the arterial &s;y&s;tem, which attends fever in young or middle-aged people. I once attended a man of 77 in a fever of the bilious kind, which confined him for eight days to his bed, in whom I could not per|ceive the lea&s;t quickne&s;s or morbid action in his pul&s;e until four and twenty hours before he died.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE marks of old age appear earlier, and are more numerous in per&s;ons who have combined with hard labour, a vegetable or &s;canty diet, than in per&s;ons who have lived under oppo&s;ite circum|&s;tances. I think I have ob&s;erved the&s;e marks of old age to occur &s;ooner, and to be more numerous in the German, than in the Engli&s;h or Iri&s;h citi|zens of Penn&s;ylvania. They are likewi&s;e more common among the inhabitants of country places, than of cities, and &s;till more &s;o among the Indians of North America, than among the inhabitants of civilized countries.</P>
<P N="5">5. OLD men tread upon the <HI>whole ba&s;e</HI> of their feet at once in <HI>walking.</HI> This is perhaps one rea&s;on why they wear out fewer &s;hoes, under the &s;ame cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="308" REF="026112_0302_0FCFF21E49EAE120">
of con&s;tant u&s;e, than young people, who by treading on the po&s;terior, and ri&s;ing on the an|terior part of their feet, expo&s;e their &s;hoes to more unequal pre&s;&s;ure and friction. The advantage de|rived to old people from this mode of walking is very obvious. It le&s;&s;ens that di&s;po&s;ition to totter which is always connected with weakne&s;s:&mdash;hence we find the &s;ame mode of walking is adopted by habitual drunkards, and is &s;ometimes from habit practi&s;ed by them, when they are not under the influence of &s;trong drink.</P>
<P N="6">6. THE <HI>memory</HI> is the fir&s;t faculty of the mind which fails in the decline of life. While recent events pa&s;s through the mind without leaving an impre&s;&s;ion upon it, it is remarkable that the long forgotten events of childhood and youth are re|called and di&s;tinctly remembered.</P>
<P>I MET with a &s;ingular in&s;tance of a German wo|man, who had learned to &s;peak the language of our country after &s;he was forty years of age, who had forgotten every word of it after &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed her 80th year, but &s;poke the German language as flu|ently as ever &s;he had done. The memory decays &s;oone&s;t in hard drinkers. I have ob&s;erved &s;ome &s;tudious men to &s;uffer a decay of their memories, but never of their under&s;tandings. Among the&s;e,
<PB N="309" REF="026112_0303_0FCFF220CA5FFD98">
was the late Anthony Benezet of this city. But even this infirmity did not abate the chearfulne&s;s, or le&s;&s;en the happine&s;s of this pious philo&s;opher, for he once told me, when I was a young man, that he had a con&s;olation in the decay of his me|mory, which gave him a great advantage over me. "You can read a good book (&s;aid he) with plea|&s;ure but <HI>once,</HI> but when I read a good book, I &s;o &s;oon forget the contents of it, that I have the plea|&s;ure of reading it over and over; and every time I read it, it is alike new and delightful to me."&mdash; The celebrated Dr. Swift was one of tho&s;e few &s;tu|dious men, who have exhibited marks of a decay of under&s;tanding in old age; but it is judiciou&s;ly a|&s;cribed by Dr. John&s;on to two cau&s;es which re&s;cue books, and the exerci&s;e of the thinking powers, from having had any &s;hare in inducing that di&s;ea&s;e upon his mind. The&s;e cau&s;es were, a ra&s;h vow which he made when a young man, never to u&s;e &s;pectacles, and a &s;ordid &s;eclu&s;ion of him&s;elf from company, by which means he was cut off from the u&s;e of books, and the benefits of conver&s;ation, the ab&s;ence of which left his mind without its u&s;ual &s;timulus&mdash;hence it collap&s;ed into a &s;tate of fatuity. It is probably owing to the con&s;tant exerci&s;e of the under&s;tanding, that literary men po&s;&s;e&s;s that faculty of the mind in a vigorous &s;tate in extreme old age. The &s;ame cau&s;e accounts for old people pre&s;erving
<PB N="310" REF="026112_0304_0FCFF222FB7BB8E0">
their intellects longer in cities, than in country places. They enjoy &s;ociety upon &s;uch ea&s;y terms in the former &s;ituation, that their minds are kept more con&s;tantly in an excited &s;tate by the acqui&s;ition of new, or the renovation of old ideas, by means of conver&s;ation.</P>
<P N="7">7. I DID not meet with a &s;ingle in&s;tance in which the moral or religious faculties were impaired in old people. I do not believe, that the&s;e faculties of the mind are pre&s;erved, by any &s;upernatural power, but wholly by the con&s;tant and increa&s;ing exerci&s;e of them in the evening of life. In the cour&s;e of my inquiries, I heard of a man of 101 years of age, who declared that he had forgotten every thing he had ever known, except his GOD. I found the moral faculty, or a di&s;po&s;ition to do kind offices, to be exqui&s;itely &s;en&s;ible in &s;everal old peo|ple, in whom there was &s;carcely a trace left of me|mory or under&s;tanding.</P>
<P N="8">8. DREAMING is univer&s;al among old people. It appears to be brought on by their imperfect &s;leep, of which I &s;hall &s;ay more hereafter.</P>
<P N="9">9. I MENTIONED formerly the &s;ign of a <HI>&s;econd childhood</HI> in the &s;tate of the appetite in old people. It appears further,&mdash;1. In the marks which &s;light
<PB N="311" REF="026112_0305_0FCFF224152C0F28">
contu&s;ions or impre&s;&s;ions leave upon their &s;kins. 2. In their being &s;oon fatigued by walking or exer|ci&s;e, and in being as &s;oon refre&s;hed by re&s;t. 3. In their di&s;po&s;ition, like children, to detail immediately every thing they &s;ee and hear. And, 4. In their aptitude to &s;hed tears; hence they are unable to tell a &s;tory that is in any degree di&s;tre&s;&s;ing without weeping. Dr. Moore takes notice of this pecu|liarity in Voltaire, after he had pa&s;&s;ed his 80th year. He wept con&s;tantly at the recital of his own tragedies. This feature in old age did not e&s;cape Homer. Old Menelaus wept ten years af|ter he returned from the de&s;truction of Troy, when he &s;poke of the death of the heroes who peri&s;hed before that city.</P>
<P N="10">10. IT would be &s;ufficiently humbling to human nature, if our bodies exhibited in old age the marks only of a &s;econd childhood; but human weakne&s;s de&s;cends &s;till lower. I met with an in&s;tance of a wo|man between 80 and 90, who exhibited the marks of a <HI>&s;econd infancy,</HI> by &s;uch a total decay of her mental faculties as to lo&s;e all con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s in di&s;|charging her alvine and urinary excretions. In this &s;tate of the body, a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;leep, &s;uc|ceeds the wakefulne&s;s of the fir&s;t &s;tages of old age. Dr. Haller mentions an in&s;tance of a very old man
<PB N="312" REF="026112_0306_0FCFF2295D7AE7D0">
who &s;lept twenty, out of every twenty-four hours during the few la&s;t years of his life.</P>
<P N="11">11. THE di&s;po&s;ition in the &s;y&s;tem to <HI>renew</HI> cer|tain parts in extreme old age, has been mentioned by &s;everal authors. Many in&s;tances are to be met with in the records of medicine of the &s;ight<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>There is a remarkable in&s;tance of the &s;ight having been re&s;tored after it had been totally de&s;troyed in an old man near Reading in Penn&s;ylvania. My brother, Jacob Ru&s;h, fur|ni&s;hed me with the following account of him in a letter from Reading, dated June 23, 1792.&mdash;</P><P>"AN old man of 84 years of age, of the name of Adam Riffle, near this town, gradually lo&s;t his &s;ight in the 68th year of his age, and continued entirely blind for the &s;pace of twelve years. About four years ago his &s;ight returned, with|out making u&s;e of any means for the purpo&s;e, and without any vi&s;ible change in the appearance of the eyes, and he now &s;ees as well as ever he did. I have &s;een the man, and have no doubt of the fact. He is at this time &s;o hearty, as to be able to walk from his hou&s;e to Reading, (about three miles) which he frequently does in order to attend church. I &s;hould ob&s;erve, that during both the gradual lo&s;s, and recovery of his &s;ight, he was no ways affected by &s;ickne&s;s, but on the contrary enjoyed his u&s;ual health. I have this account from his daughter and &s;on in-law, who live within a few doors of me."</P></NOTE> and hearing having been re&s;tored, and even of the teeth having been renewed in old people a few years be|fore death. The&s;e phenomena have led me to &s;u&s;pect,
<PB N="313" REF="026112_0307_0FCFF22ACF19F780">
that the antediluvian age was attained by the fre|quent renovation of different parts of the body, and that when they occur, they are an effort of the cau&s;es which &s;upport animal life, to produce antediluvian longevity, by acting upon the revived excitability of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P N="12">12. THE <HI>fear</HI> of death appears to be much le&s;s in old age, than in early, or middle life. I met with many old people who &s;poke of their di&s;&s;olu|tion with compo&s;ure, and with &s;ome who expre&s;&s;ed earne&s;t de&s;ires to lie down in the grave. This in|difference to life, and de&s;ire for death (whether they ari&s;e from &s;atiety in worldly pur&s;uits and plea|&s;ures, or from a de&s;ire of being relieved from pain) appear to be a wi&s;e law in the animal oeconomy, and worthy of being cla&s;&s;ed with tho&s;e laws which accommodate the body and mind of man to all the natural evils, to which, in the common order of things, they are nece&s;&s;arily expo&s;ed.</P>
<P N="3">III. I COME now briefly to enumerate the di&s;|ea&s;es of old age, and the remedies which are mo&s;t proper to remove, or to mitigate them.</P>
<P>THE di&s;ea&s;es are chronic and acute. The CHRONIC are,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="314" REF="026112_0308_0FCFF23338349878">1. WEAKNESS of the <HI>knees</HI> and <HI>ankles,</HI> a le&s;|&s;ened ability to walk, and tremors in the head and limbs.</P>
<P N="2">2. PAINS <HI>in the bones,</HI> known among no&s;ologi|cal writers by the name of rheumitalgia.</P>
<P N="3">3. INVOLUNTARY <HI>flow of tears,</HI> and of mucus from the no&s;e.</P>
<P N="4">4. DIFFICULTY <HI>of breathing,</HI> and a &s;hort <HI>cough,</HI> with copious expectoration. A weak, or hoar&s;e voice generally attends this cough.</P>
<P N="5">5. COSTIVENESS.</P>
<P N="6">6. AN <HI>inability to retain the urine</HI> as long as in early or middle life. Few per&s;ons beyond 60 pa&s;s a whole night without being obliged to di&s;charge their urine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I met with an old man who informed me, that if from any accident he retained his urine after he felt an inclination to di&s;charge it, he was affected by a numbne&s;s, accompanied by an unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation in the palms of his hands.</NOTE>. Perhaps the &s;timulus of this liquor in the bladder may be one cau&s;e of the univer&s;ality of dreaming among old people. It is certainly a frequent cau&s;e of dreaming in per&s;ons in early and
<PB N="315" REF="026112_0309_0FCFF235CDDFA2C0">
middle life: this I infer, from its occurring chiefly in the morning when the bladder is mo&s;t di&s;tended with urine. There is likewi&s;e an inability in old people to di&s;charge their urine as quickly as in early life. I think I have ob&s;erved this to be a|mong the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of the declen&s;ion of the &s;trength of the body by age.</P>
<P N="7">7th. WAKEFULNESS. This is probably produ|ced in part by the action of the urine upon the bladder; but &s;uch is the excitability of the &s;y&s;tem in the fir&s;t &s;tages of old age, that there is no pain &s;o light, no anxiety &s;o trifling, and no &s;ound &s;o &s;mall, as not to produce wakefulne&s;s in old people. It is owing to their imperfect &s;leep, that they are &s;ometimes as uncon&s;cious of the moment of their pa&s;&s;ing from a &s;leeping to a waking &s;tate, as young and middle aged people are of the moment in which they pa&s;s from the waking to a &s;leeping &s;tate. Hence we &s;o often hear them complain of pa&s;&s;ing &s;leeple&s;s nights. This is no doubt fre|quently the ca&s;e, but I am &s;atisfied, from the re&s;ult of an inquiry made upon this &s;ubject, that they often &s;leep without knowing it, and that their com|plaints in the morning, of the want of &s;leep, ari&s;e from ignorance, without the lea&s;t intention to de|ceive.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="316" REF="026112_0310_0FCFF236DB7CFCC0">8. <HI>Giddine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Deafne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Imperfect vi&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>THE ACUTE di&s;ea&s;es mo&s;t common among old people, are</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Imflammation of the eyes.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. THE <HI>pnuemonia notha,</HI> or ba&s;tard peripneu|mony.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE <HI>colic.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Pal&s;y</HI> and <HI>apoplexy.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. THE <HI>piles.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. A <HI>difficulty</HI> in <HI>making water.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Quartan fever.</HI></P>
<P>ALL the di&s;ea&s;es of old people, both chronic and acute, originate in debility. The remedies for the former, where no morbid action takes place in the &s;y&s;tem, are &s;timulants. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is,</P>
<P N="1">I. HEAT. The ancient Romans prolonged life by retiring to Naples, as &s;oon as they felt the infirmities of age coming upon them. The aged Portugue&s;e imitate them, by approaching the mild &s;un of Brazil, in South America. But
<PB N="317" REF="026112_0311_0FCF49319B490BE0">
heat may be applied to the torpid bodies of old people artificially&mdash;1&s;t. By means of the <HI>warm bath.</HI> Dr. Franklin owed much of the cheerful|ne&s;s and general vigor of body and mind which characterized his old age, to his regular u&s;e of this remedy. It di&s;po&s;ed him to &s;leep, and even produced a re&s;pite from the pain of the &s;tone, with which he was afflicted during the la&s;t years of his life.</P>
<P N="2">2. HEAT may be applied to the bodies of old people by means of <HI>&s;tove rooms.</HI> The late Dr. De|wit of Germantown, who lived to be near an 100 years of age, &s;eldom breathed an air below 72&deg;, after he became an old man. He lived con&s;tantly in a &s;tove room.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Warm cloathing,</HI> more e&s;pecially warm bed-clothes, are proper to pre&s;erve or increa&s;e the heat of old people. From the neglect of the lat|ter, they are often found dead in their beds in the morning, after a cold night, in all cold countries. The late Dr. Chovet, of this city, who lived to be 85 &s;lept in a baize night gown, under eight blank|ets, and a coverlet, in a &s;tove room, many years before he died. The head &s;hould be defended in old people by means of woollen, or fur caps, in the night, and by wigs and hats during the day, in
<PB N="318" REF="026112_0312_0FCFF238ABC765C0">
cold weather. The&s;e artificial coverings will be the more nece&s;&s;ary, where the head has been de|prived of its natural covering. Great pains &s;hould be taken likewi&s;e to keep the feet dry and warm, by means of thick &s;hoes.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I met with one man above 80, who defended his feet from moi&s;ture by covering his &s;hoes in wet weather with melted wax; and another who, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, co|vered his &s;hoes every morning with a mixture compo&s;ed of the following ingredients melted together&mdash;Lint&s;eed oil a pound, mutton &s;uet eight ounces, bees-wax &s;ix ounces, and ro&s;in four ounces. The mixture &s;hould be moderately warmed, and then applied not only to the upper leather, but to the &s;oles of the &s;hoes. This compo&s;ition, the old gentleman informed me, was extracted from a book entitled "The complete Fi&s;herman," publi&s;hed in England in the reign of queen Elizabeth. He had u&s;ed it for twenty years in cold and wet weather, with great benefit, and &s;everal of his friends who had tried it, &s;poke of its efficacy in keep|ing the feet dry, in high terms.</NOTE> To the&s;e modes of ap|plying and confining heat to the bodies of old people, a young bed-fellow has been added; but I conceive the three artificial modes which have been recommended, will be &s;ufficient without the u&s;e of one, which cannot be &s;ucce&s;sfully employed without a breach of delicacy or humanity.</P>
<P N="2">II. TO keep up the action of the &s;y&s;tem, <HI>gene|rous diet</HI> and <HI>drinks</HI> &s;hould be given to old people.
<PB N="319" REF="026112_0313_0FCFF23AADA082F0">
For a rea&s;on mentioned formerly, they &s;hould be indulged in eating between the ordinary meals of families. Wine &s;hould be given to them in mo|deration. It has been emphatically called the milk of old age.</P>
<P N="3">III. YOUNG COMPANY &s;hould be preferred by old people to the company of per&s;ons of their own age. I think I have ob&s;erved old people to enjoy better health and &s;pirits, when they have pa&s;&s;ed the evening of their lives in the families of their children, where they have been &s;urrounded by grand children, than when they lived by them|&s;elves. Even the &s;olicitude they feel for the wel|fare of their de&s;cendants contributes to invigorate the circulation of the blood, and thereby to add fuel to the lamp of life.</P>
<P N="4">IV. GENTLE EXERCISE. This is of great con&s;equence in promoting the health of old peo|ple. It &s;hould be moderate, regular, and always in fair weather.</P>
<P N="5">V. CLEANLINESS. This &s;hould by no means be neglected. The dre&s;s of old people &s;hould not on|ly be clean, but more elegant than in youth or middle life. It &s;erves to divert the eye of &s;pecta|tors from ob&s;erving the decay and deformity of
<PB N="320" REF="026112_0314_0FCFF23C4116A020" MS="y">
the body, to view and admire that which is always agreeable to it.</P>
<P N="6">VI. TO abate the pains of the chronic rheuma|ti&s;m, and the unea&s;ine&s;s of the old man's cough (as it is called); al&s;o to remove wakefulne&s;s, and to re&s;train, during the night, a trouble&s;ome inclina|tion to make water, OPIUM may be given with great advantage. Chardin informs us, that this medicine is frequently u&s;ed in the ea&s;tern countries to abate the pains and weakne&s;&s;es of old age, by tho&s;e people who are debarred the u&s;e wine by the religion of Mahomet.</P>
<P>I HAVE nothing to &s;ay upon the acute di&s;ea&s;es of old people, but what is to be found in mo&s;t of our books of medicine, except to recommend BLEEDING in tho&s;e of them which are attended with plethora, and an inflammatory action in the pul&s;e. The degrees of appetite which belong to old age, the quality of the food taken, and the &s;eden|tary life which is generally connected with it, all concur to produce that &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem, which requires the above evacuation. I am &s;ure that I have &s;een many of the chronic complaints of old peo|ple mitigated by it, and I have more than once &s;een it u&s;ed with obvious advantage in their inflamma|tory di&s;ea&s;es. The&s;e affections I have ob&s;erv|ed

to be more fatal among old people than is ge|nerally &s;uppo&s;ed. An inflammation of the lungs, which terminated in an ab&s;ce&s;s, deprived the world of Dr. Franklin. Dr. Chovet died of an inflam|mation in his liver. The blood drawn from him a few days before his death was &s;izy, and &s;uch was the heat of his body, produced by his fever, that he could not bear more covering, (notwith&s;tanding his former habits of warm cloathing) than a &s;heet in the month of January.</P>
<P>DEATH from old age is the effect of a gradual pal&s;y. It &s;hews it&s;elf fir&s;t in the eyes and ears in the decay of &s;ight and hearing&mdash;it appears next in the urinary bladder, in the limbs and trunk of the body, then in the &s;phincters of the bladder and rectum, and finally in the nerves and brain, de|&s;troying in the la&s;t, the exerci&s;e of all the faculties of the mind.</P>
