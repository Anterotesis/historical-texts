<P>'TIS the right and the duty of a free people&punc; to watch attentively the movements of eve|ry department of public tru&s;t. Whether tho&s;e whom they employ, fill executive, judicial, or le|gi&s;lative &s;tations, &s;till they are equally the &s;ervants of the people, and amenable to them, for their con|duct. This great political truth, is now rapidly &s;preading it&s;elf throughout the other regions of the earth, and liberating mankind from the tyranny which has long oppre&s;&s;ed them. In America, it was never doubted.</P>
<P>'Tis particularly their duty to watch attentively the conduct of the legi&s;lature. Whil&s;t that branch pre&s;erves its independence and integrity, they are &s;afe. They have nothing to apprehend either from the noxious quality of the laws, or their inva&s;ion by the other departments of the government. It forms a bulwark of &s;ufficient &s;trength, to baffle eve|ry danger, that may a&s;&s;ail them from without. But whenever it lo&s;es the&s;e indi&s;pen&s;ible qualifications, their &s;ecurity is gone, unle&s;s they can immediately repair the breaches that are made.</P>
<P>Unhappily, this branch from which alone real danger may be apprehended, is be&s;t fortified again&s;t the &s;u&s;picion of it. 'Tis the nature of an executive tru&s;t, where the operations are directed by a &s;ingle hand, e&s;pecially if they are exten&s;ive and important, to in&s;pire jealou&s;y and di&s;tru&s;t; to warn every ci|tizen
<PB N="4" REF="026245_0003_0FCFAB24F7E68FE8">
to &s;tand on his guard, and ob&s;erve its cour&s;e. But with the repre&s;entative, the ca&s;e is different: Many con&s;iderations ari&s;ing from the mode of his appointment, and his duty, tend to connect him, in more intimate confidence, with his con&s;tituents. This propen&s;ity &s;hould therefore be re&s;i&s;ted with deci&s;ive force, for otherwi&s;e it will open a door, through which the public rights may be invaded with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations apply in a greater or le&s;s de|gree to every free government; but they apply with peculiar force to the government of the&s;e States. Many circum&s;tances exi&s;t in our &s;y&s;tem which tend in a certain degree, to weaken the checks of the &s;e|veral departments upon each other, and to le&s;&s;en the re&s;pon&s;ibility of the repre&s;entative to his con&s;ti|tuent. Of the&s;e &s;ome perhaps will be eternal, as pro|ceeding from cau&s;es beyond the reach of human re|medy. Others of the adventitious kind have been added. That we may however perfectly compre|hend our true &s;ituation, and the ruling policy of our councils, from the adoption of the government to the pre&s;ent time, it may be proper to notice a few of the&s;e in both re&s;pects. They will enable us to decide with greater propriety, on the tran&s;ac|tions which I mean more particularly to lay bare, to the public in&s;pection.</P>
<P>'Tis in&s;eparably incident to a federal govern|ment, for rea&s;ons too well under&s;tood to require illu&s;tration, that the repre&s;entation &s;hould be com|paratively thin. Hence it follows, that as each mem|ber mu&s;t repre&s;ent a great extent of territory, and con&s;iderable number of inhabitants, he can in ge|neral be but little known to his con&s;tituents in the commencement. They mu&s;t of cour&s;e take his me|rits, and vote for him, in a great mea&s;ure, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, upon tru&s;t. And the extent of the territo|ry
<PB N="5" REF="026245_0004_0FCFAB1FF6175210">
over which our government in particular is or|ganized, will prevent their ever being well acquaint|ed with him afterwards. 'Tis &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to com|municate that regular and thorough information, of all tran&s;actions, from the &s;eat of government to the extremities, &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to enable the con&s;tituent to judge with propriety of the conduct of his repre&s;entative. This, in equal degree le&s;&s;ens the re&s;pon&s;ibility; for a repre&s;entative acting on a di&s;|tant theatre, never &s;een, and &s;eldom heard of, by his con&s;tituent, except through the medium of his own corre&s;pondence, has little to fear from his cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>In a &s;ingle well organized government, the wi&s;|dom and purity of its admini&s;tration, are e&s;&s;ential|ly promoted by the jealou&s;y which takes place be|tween the &s;everal branches of each other, and e|&s;pecially between the legi&s;lative and the executive. This ju&s;tifies the policy of the di&s;tribution, and pre|&s;erves in full force the check intended by it. But the obvious tendency of the federal principle is to di&s;&s;ipate this jealou&s;y, and enfeeble the check be|tween the &s;everal departments of the national go|vernment. A coalition with the State &s;overeign|ties, naturally unites them together, to re&s;i&s;t a fo|reign pre&s;&s;ure. And this proportionably contributes to de&s;troy the independence of the legi&s;lature, and dimini&s;h the re&s;pon&s;ibility of its members.</P>
<P>The&s;e infirmities, and e&s;pecially the latter, are in a great mea&s;ure without cure; it were however rational to expect, that the mo&s;t whole&s;ome remedies would have been applied, &s;o as to fortify the &s;y&s;|tem again&s;t any malign effects which could po&s;&s;ibly be avoided. But the contrary has been the cour&s;e of our admini&s;tration. Active and &s;ucce&s;sful efforts have been made to increa&s;e the evil where it was a natural one, and to accumulate others of the arti|ficial kind. The be&s;t expedient which policy could
<PB N="6" REF="026245_0005_0FCF8BB925050148">
dictate, to remedy tho&s;e inconveniencies re&s;ulting from the extent of territory, was by opening their doors, to &s;ubject their legi&s;lative di&s;cu&s;&s;ions to the free and common audience of every citizen, and to promote the free and rapid circulation of the new&s;|papers. But has this been done? On the contrary, have we not &s;een with amazement, one branch of the legi&s;lature, withdraw it&s;elf into a &s;eque&s;tered chamber, and &s;hut its doors upon its con&s;tituents, &s;till guarding them with ob&s;tinate per&s;everance, al|though more than one half the union have required that they be opened? Have we not likewi&s;e &s;een the free circulation of the news-papers, clogged with taxes which amount almo&s;t to a prohibition? Are the&s;e things the mere effect of accident, or are they the re&s;ult of cool deliberation? contemplating ob|jects dreadful to this country.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations demon&s;trate, that it is diffi|cult to pre&s;erve in the members of the national legi&s;|lature, that degree of re&s;pon&s;ibility to their con&s;titu|ents, which the principle under other circum&s;tan|ces admits of; and that tho&s;e who have been called to that &s;tation, &s;ince the organization of the go|vernment, have &s;hewn an earne&s;t de&s;ire to rid them|&s;elves of that portion of which it is capable. They likewi&s;e demon&s;trate that from cau&s;es which are na|tural, the &s;everal branches, in&s;tead of forming a per|fect check upon each other, and thereby &s;ecuring to the people a purity in the admini&s;tration of each, are to a certain degree impelled in a contrary direc|tion, and forced together, into a con&s;trained and politic harmony, for common defence.</P>
<P>But this propen&s;ity, however &s;trong it may be, has been powerfully aided by &s;ome in&s;titutions of great force and efficacy. A charm has been formed of &s;ufficient &s;trength to draw them together, if the repul&s;ive power had been naturally ten times greater
<PB N="7" REF="026245_0006_0FCFAB1E6F842F40">
than the attractive one really is. An immen&s;e debt has been accumulated, from every region of the union, and of every po&s;&s;ible de&s;cription, con&s;tituted into funds of almo&s;t perpetual duration, and &s;ub|ject from its nature upon the &s;lighte&s;t incidents, to con&s;tant fluctuation, with a power in the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, through the medium of the &s;inking fund, to rai&s;e it at plea&s;ure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has depended on the Secretary to &s;ay when money could or could not be furni&s;hed for the &s;inking fund, out of the funds appropriated for the purpo&s;e, and even out of monies borrowed for and legally applicable to no other purpo&s;e. And under his direction has ultimately fallen the execution of the purcha&s;es.</NOTE>. And upon the ba&s;is of this debt, a bank of di&s;count has been formed, allied by its charter to the government it&s;elf, and in a great mea&s;ure &s;ubjected to the direction of the &s;ame officer.</P>
<P>The experience of other countries has &s;hewn that the dealers in the public funds, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e who&s;e fortunes con&s;i&s;t principally in that line, have no intere&s;t and of cour&s;e feel but little concern, in all tho&s;e que&s;tions of fi&s;cal policy which particu|larly affect the land-holder, the merchant, and the arti&s;t. Although the&s;e cla&s;&s;es &s;hould groan, under the burdens of the government, yet the public cre|ditor will be no otherwi&s;e affected by the pre&s;&s;ure, than as he receives what has been gleaned from their indu&s;try. The tax never reaches him, till the mo|ney is counted out quarterly from the public coffers, in di&s;charge of his claim. They are the tenants of the farm, he the landlord and the man of revenue. The di&s;parity of their intere&s;ts, and the difference of their &s;en&s;ations, re&s;pecting the objects to which they point, in a great mea&s;ure &s;eparate them in &s;ociety. Knowing that they live upon the labour of the other cla&s;&s;es, the public creditors behold them with jea|lou&s;y, &s;u&s;pect a thou&s;and vi&s;ionary &s;chemes again&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="026245_0007_0FCFAB1C8F154C30">
their welfare, and are always alarmed and agitated with every the mo&s;t trifling incident which hap|pens. And having one common intere&s;t which con|&s;i&s;ts <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">mply in the impo&s;ition of high taxes and their rigid collection, they form a compact body and move always in concert. Whil&s;t the admini&s;tration finds the means to &s;atisfy their claims, they are always de|voted to it, and &s;upport all its mea&s;ures. They therefore may be con&s;idered in every country, where &s;ub&s;tantial funds are e&s;tabli&s;hed, and their demands punctually paid, as a mini&s;terial corps, leagued to|gether upon principles to a certain degree ho&s;tile to the re&s;t of the community.</P>
<P>But this dread of the other cla&s;&s;es, and &s;ub&s;ervi|ence to fi&s;cal policy, have been increa&s;ed here be|yond what was ever experienced before, and by cau|&s;es extremely natural. The trifling con&s;ideration given for the debt, by the pre&s;ent holders, with the comparative merit of their characters, with that of the officers and &s;oldiery of the late army, and the well known &s;en&s;e which the community entertain on that &s;ubject, mu&s;t in&s;pire a di&s;tru&s;t that will di&s;|quiet their peace for a time. The claims of ju&s;tice although from motives of policy, they may be &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed, yet the cries which they rai&s;e, are terrible to tho&s;e who live on the u&s;urpation. Nor can the gay fe&s;tivity, nor the pomp and &s;plendour it &s;upports, &s;hield them from the admonition. This throws them blindly into the hands of tho&s;e who patronize their intere&s;ts. In addition to which, the policy and ope|ration of the &s;inking fund, by which the ri&s;e of &s;tocks is in a great mea&s;ure regulated, mu&s;t contribute greatly to &s;ubject the party intere&s;ted to the controul of tho&s;e who direct its application.</P>
<P>If then the certificate-holders or dealers in the funds in general, are &s;ub&s;ervient to the views of a department faithful to their intere&s;ts, is it rea&s;onable
<PB N="9" REF="026245_0008_0FCFAB1B286118E0">
to expect that &s;uch as have, or may hereafter be|come members of Congre&s;s, will prove le&s;s &s;o? Be|ing on the great theatre of &s;peculation and gain, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more correct information, with the means of turning it to better account, will they a|bandon their occupation and &s;light the opportunity offered, of becoming thrifty? In what condition would the land-holder, the merchant, and the arti&s;t, find them&s;elves, if they &s;hould be repre&s;ented in the national legi&s;lature by per&s;ons of this de&s;cription on|ly? might they not count at lea&s;t upon high taxes and their rigid collection? 'Tis the fir&s;t principle of a free government, that tho&s;e who impo&s;e the tax &s;hould feel the effect, but here it would be not only violated, but rever&s;ed. What &s;ecurity would the people have in any of the departments of govern|ment, who&s;e checks were de&s;troyed by an intere&s;t which &s;upervened every con&s;ideration of public good?</P>
<P>But the proprietors of bank &s;tock, are &s;till more &s;ub&s;ervient to this policy, than any other cla&s;s of public creditors. The in&s;titution it&s;elf being found|ed on the &s;ame paper &s;y&s;tem, mu&s;t communicate the &s;ame intere&s;ts to tho&s;e within its &s;phere. And in other re&s;pects, it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a &s;trength and energy, to which the common members of the fi&s;cal corps, are &s;trangers. The &s;uperiority of its gains invigorates the principle common to all; but the con&s;titutional &s;ubordination to the head of that department, &s;anc|tifies under the cloak of authority, that degree of &s;ub&s;ervience which a &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, among inde|pendent men, might occa&s;ionally forbid.</P>
<P>The bank however &s;hould not be con&s;idered &s;im|ply in the light of an in&s;titution, uniting together with greater force, the members of the fi&s;cal corps. As an engine of influence, capable under the ma|nagement authorized by its principles, of polluting every operation of the government, it is entitled to
<PB N="10" REF="026245_0009_0FCFAB19A11BFF78">
particular attention. In this view a conci&s;e illu&s;tra|tion, may not be deemed improper. The &s;tocks are low, and the command of money for a &s;hort term only, would enable the holder to clear with certain|ty &s;uch a &s;um. A que&s;tion of moment is depending, and a member of Congre&s;s may obtain a di&s;count with the bank for that &s;um. He makes the pur|cha&s;e. The party aiding this operation with the bank, has likewi&s;e the direction of the &s;inking fund: its monies are <HI>&s;ea&s;onably</HI> and <HI>publicly</HI> exhibited at the market, and the &s;tocks ri&s;e. The gain has been made, and the demands of the bank may likewi&s;e be an&s;wered. Or perhaps he is indigent, pre&s;&s;ed by dif|ficulties, and &s;eeks to be thus relieved: or his note has been already depo&s;ited in the bank, and to &s;ome amount, and the day for repayment approaches, has he the means? and if he has not, how &s;hall he be reliev|ed from this painful dilemma? Shall the indulgence be extended again and again, and by the interce&s;&s;ion of this per&s;on? Have the members of the legi&s;lature &s;ufficient independence, virtue, and firmne&s;s, to with&s;tand the&s;e temptations? And are there not oc|ca&s;ions in the operations of every government, when tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch means of influence, will find it their intere&s;t to avail them&s;elves of it, to quiet the opponents to their mea&s;ures? Have not &s;uch ari&s;en in the cour&s;e of our government, which commenced, as it were, but ye&s;terday?</P>
<P>The contamination would however have been par|tial, and the practicable means of influence abridg|ed, if the alliance of the bank had been confined to an executive department only. With a mini&s;ter in that branch, a negociation with the members of the legi&s;lature, would have been difficult, as certain forms &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the departments of govern|ment, put them at a di&s;tance from each other. Se|duction does not operate by means direct or overt.
<PB N="11" REF="026245_0010_0FCFAB175FF4A230">
If not abandoned and at auction, the integrity of a member mu&s;t be a&s;&s;ailed more gently, and without the appearance of a bribe. It mu&s;t be forced on him, under the ma&s;k of friend&s;hip. It became there|fore nece&s;&s;ary, to bring the legi&s;lature into more in|timate contact with this monied machine, and for this purpo&s;e to appoint &s;everal of its members bank directors. In England, the mini&s;ter of finance is a member of parliament; by him negociations may be carried on in per&s;on; but here the con&s;titution forbade it; this then was the next be&s;t alternative. Thus organi&s;ed, the game becomes more ea&s;y. In all operations upon the legi&s;lature, whether for the par|ticular emolument of the bank, the fi&s;cal corps in general, or any other purpo&s;e, in which the views of the party are intere&s;ted, the pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s is greatly improved. And in all inquiries relative to the conduct of the officer, in the management of the public monies, the&s;e members of Congre&s;s, <HI>bank directors,</HI> and the bank it&s;elf, give him their firm and uniform &s;upport. In <HI>their eyes</HI> his conduct will ap|pear <HI>immaculate, angelic,</HI> and partaking perhaps of &s;omething &s;till more divine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the &s;peech of William Smith, of South Carolina, on the late proceedings, where he &s;ays, "That the Secretary would in the i&s;&s;ue ri&s;e above every calumny, as fair as the pure&s;t angel in heaven."&mdash;Mr. S&mdash;, <HI>it is well known,</HI> holds between three and four hundred &s;hares in the bank of the United States, and has obtained di&s;counts, <HI>ad libitum.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>If we take an impartial review of the mea&s;ures of the government, from its adoption to the pre&s;ent time, we &s;hall find its practice has corre&s;ponded, in every re&s;pect, with this theory. The demon|&s;tration &s;trikes us in every page of the law, that a faction of monarchic &s;peculators, &s;eized upon its legi&s;lative functions in the commencement, and have directed all its operations &s;ince. We &s;hall find,
<PB N="12" REF="026245_0011_0FCFAB13F621C9C0">
that to the views of this faction, an apt in&s;trument has been obtained in the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, and to who&s;e emolument and advancement, all his mea&s;ures have been made &s;ub&s;ervient. If the pub|lic debt has been accumulated by every po&s;&s;ible con|trivance, buoyed up by means of the &s;inking fund, made in a great mea&s;ure perpetual, and formed in|to a powerful monied machine, dependent on the fi&s;cal admini&s;tration, to this combination it is due. If by means of this &s;udden elevation of fortune, a dangerous inequality of rank has been created a|mong the citizens of the&s;e States, thereby laying the foundation for the &s;ubver&s;ion of the government it&s;elf, by undermining its true principles, to this combination it is due. If tho&s;e &s;ound and genuine principles of re&s;pon&s;ibility, which belong to repre|&s;entative government, and con&s;titute its bulwark, and pre&s;erve its harmony, have been annulled or weakened; if a practicable means of influence, whereby the members of the legi&s;lature may be de|bauched from the duty they owe their con&s;tituents, has been formed; if, by implication and con&s;truc|tion, the obvious &s;en&s;e of the con&s;titution has been perverted, and its powers enlarged, &s;o as to pave the way for the conver&s;ion of the government from a limited into an unlimited one, to this combina|tion they are due. The catalogue of enormities is a lengthy one, but its truth is well known to tho&s;e who have marked the cour&s;e of public proceedings, or examined the acts.</P>
<P>A more thorough developement of the&s;e mea&s;ures with their pernicious tendency, may perhaps be pre|&s;ented in a future e&s;&s;ay; the object of the pre&s;ent one is more particularly to demon&s;trate, that by vir|tue of this combination, all regard for their con&s;ti|tuents has been abandoned by the parties to it, and that the public can neither count upon the indepen|dence
<PB N="13" REF="026245_0012_0FCFAB10A784CE58">
or integrity of the legi&s;lature, or the re&s;pon&s;i|bility of the other departments, whil&s;t it la&s;ts.</P>
<P>That the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury has been faith|ful to this corps, and performed his part of the co|venant, is well known. Every report from his de|partment furni&s;hes the proof. Through him propo|&s;itions for a&s;&s;umption, after a&s;&s;umption, with all the properties of the debt, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the bank, and for loans from the bank, for the latitude of con&s;truction contended for in the powers of the government, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have been u&s;hered into Congre&s;s. By them firm &s;upport has been given to the&s;e propo|&s;itions. But it remained for an experiment &s;till more intere&s;ting to the parties, and alarming to the com|munity, to try the &s;trength of this combination, and evince its turpitude; the particulars of which I will now detail.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the&s;e tran&s;actions and for the term of four years, the real &s;tate of the public finances was never &s;earched into by the legi&s;lature. It was however manife&s;t to the more ob&s;ervant, that the affairs of that department had gradually a&s;&s;umed a complexity and ob&s;curity, which rendered them al|mo&s;t impenetrable. To every &s;ucceeding &s;e&s;&s;ion re|ports had been made that there was a &s;urplus of re|venue, and yet rea&s;ons were urged for an increa&s;e of the public burdens, and with which the legi&s;lature had complied. Foreign loans were likewi&s;e an|nounced, but no intimation given, how far the fo|reign debt had been di&s;charged, or in fact how the&s;e loans had been applied. In this &s;ituation, early in the late &s;e&s;&s;ion, a well known partizan and member of the fi&s;cal corps<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. S&mdash;k, of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</NOTE>, introduced a bill into the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, for applying a &s;um &s;aid to be on hand, to the amount of two millions of dollars, in di&s;charge of the debt due the bank, on account of the &s;hares taken by the United States. It &s;eemed
<PB N="14" REF="026245_0013_0FCFAB0E8B2B0628">
&s;trange how there could be lying idle &s;uch a &s;um, and in the cour&s;e of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion only it appeared, that it con&s;i&s;ted of the foreign loans, which had been drawn into this country by the Secretary of the Trea|&s;ury.</P>
<P>It became immediately an object worthy enquiry, why this money had been drawn here. If it was idle, the demon&s;tration mu&s;t be deemed &s;atisfactory, there had been no occa&s;ion for it: Of cour&s;e that the dome&s;tic re&s;ources had been amply adequate to their objects, and in particular tho&s;e of the &s;inking fund, to which alone any foreign money was appli|cable.</P>

The motive to mea|&s;ures in them&s;elves &s;o oppo&s;ite and contradictory, the one founded on the idea of a large &s;urplus lying idle, and the other of a poverty in the trea&s;ury, was inexplicable. Nor could it be accounted for upon any rational principle, why the bank &s;hould allow a payment to extingui&s;h a loan at 6 <HI>per</HI> cent. one tenth of which only it was bound to receive, and make one immediately after at five. It could not be pre|&s;umed that the individual adventurers in the in&s;titu|tion, would &s;acrifice their intere&s;ts to the public; it is well known that &s;uch &s;acrifices are &s;eldom made, nor ought they indeed to be expected. It was natu|ral to infer that inducements of a different kind led to this arrangement between the bank directors and the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, and which no public documents exhibited.</P>

<P>To this order the Secretary reported on the 3d of January following that 18.678.000 florins, equal to 7.471.200 dollars, had been borrowed. That of this &s;um 4.029.217 dollars had been paid to France, a|bout 3.000.000 dols. drawn into America, 2.304.369 of which by bills upon our bankers, and between 6 and 700.000 dollars by a diver&s;ion of that amount to the payment of the intere&s;t of the foreign debt, and that the re&s;idue of the &s;um borrowed (except a|bout 160.000 dollars &s;till on hand) had been, <HI>or were to be</HI> applied to different purpo&s;es abroad<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It would be highly &s;atisfactory to know with certainty that this mo|ney is really on hand; the prevailing and probable opinion is, that it has been turned to the actual &s;ervice of the bank, and of tho&s;e who have &s;peculated on its di&s;counts.&mdash;The &s;u&s;picions on this &s;ubject are &s;tronge&s;t with tho&s;e who are be&s;t acquainted with the late tran&s;actions and pre&s;ent condition of that in&s;titution: And when large &s;ums have been taken without nece&s;&s;ity, and put in a &s;ituation which admits of abu&s;es with &s;carce a po&s;&s;ibility of detection, it affords &s;ufficient ground for the &s;trong|e&s;t &s;u&s;picion, that every thing is not as it ought to be.</NOTE>.</P>

But the que&s;tion &s;till remained to be an&s;wered, Why had this money been drawn here? where was it, if on hand, or how di&s;bur&s;ed? The report threw no light on the&s;e important points, but rather increa&s;ed the ob&s;curity with which it had been inveloped. There was therefore an obvious impropriety in proceeding further upon either of the bills, which were depend|ing at this time, one before each hou&s;e, until the real &s;tate of the public finances &s;hould be thoroughly under&s;tood. To vote the foreign money improperly drawn here to the bank, thereby preventing its po&s;&s;i|ble application to any object for which it was origi|nally intended, or to complicate our affairs further by another loan from that in&s;titution, were by no means de&s;ireable objects, at lea&s;t with tho&s;e who had commenced the inquiry.

upon the conduct of one of the members of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, highly di&s;re&s;pectful to the Hou&s;e, and a &s;eries of elaborate e&s;&s;ays illu&s;trative principally of the policy of our in&s;titutions, relative to which no information had been required, and of which certainly no panegyric from him was nece&s;&s;a|ry.

<P>It is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary in this &s;tage, and after the &s;ubject has been, &s;o fully and ably, di&s;cu&s;&s;ed before the public, to mention the nature, extent, and ob|jects of tho&s;e funds which the Secretary had to di&s;|bur&s;e, with the extent of his authority over them. A brief &s;tatement may, however, make it more ex|plicit,
<PB N="19" REF="026245_0018_0FCFAB048BF0A018">
and intelligible. The following then is the outline: Upon the dome&s;tic revenues con&s;i&s;ting of impo&s;t, tonnage, and exci&s;e, the current expences of the government, with the intere&s;t upon the fo|reign and dome&s;tic debt, were &s;olely chargeable. Two foreign loans were authorized by law, the fir&s;t of 12,000,000 of dollars of the 4th of Augu&s;t 1790, and the &s;econd of 2,000,000 of the 12th en&s;uing of the &s;ame month, de&s;tined for different purpo&s;es, and e&s;tabli&s;hed on different funds. The fir&s;t was deem|ed commen&s;urate with the whole foreign debt, and was &s;ugge&s;ted as well from the nece&s;&s;ity of providing for the in&s;talments as they became due, and which it was concluded could not otherwi&s;e be &s;atisfied, as by the con&s;ideration that as the debt it&s;elf was con|tracted in the cour&s;e of the late war, under very in|au&s;picious circum&s;tances, and whil&s;t the fate of tho&s;e &s;trenuous and manly exertions, then making for our independence, was uncertain, it were po&s;&s;ible in the pre&s;ent more pro&s;perous &s;tate of our affairs, to ob|tain a remodification of it to advantage. The &s;econd was intended in aid of the &s;um of 1,374,656 dollars, being the &s;urplus of revenue at the end of 1790, ap|propriated for the &s;inking fund; and for this latter purpo&s;e only, if required, could any foreign money be drawn here. The power over the&s;e loans, was given in every re&s;pect, exclu&s;ively to the Pre&s;ident. In regard to them, the Secretary acted by his in|&s;truction, and under his authority, only.</P>
<P>In the di&s;charge of the ordinary duties of the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, and which I never con|&s;idered as being very difficult or important, other|wi&s;e than as the care and application of great &s;ums of public money make it &s;o, the cour&s;e appears to me to be both &s;imple and obvious. If the revenue &s;hould at any time prove inadequate, the deficiency could not be attributed to him, nor the executive,
<PB N="20" REF="026245_0019_0FCFAB0338DD24E8">
unle&s;s indeed fallacious &s;tatements had been given as the ground for additional charges, a&s;&s;umptions, increa&s;e of the military e&s;tabli&s;hment, and the like. In &s;uch event it became his duty to &s;tate the fact &s;imply and correctly to the legi&s;lature, that they might in time &s;upply &s;uch additional funds, as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary; and if the dome&s;tic re&s;ources of the &s;inking fund were exhau&s;ted, to &s;tate the fact to the Pre&s;ident, that he might determine whe|ther he would avail him&s;elf of a foreign loan.</P>
<P>In the foreign tran&s;action, and which was com|mitted to the Pre&s;ident, two con&s;iderations were to be principally regarded&mdash;the fir&s;t, not to borrow at all, unle&s;s, in relation to the object for which the money was de&s;igned, it might be done with advan|tage&mdash;and the &s;econd, &s;o to arrange the bu&s;ine&s;s, that the money borrowed &s;hould, immediately af|ter it was received, be paid over to tho&s;e for whom it was procured, otherwi&s;e we would be &s;ubjected to the payment of double intere&s;t. For this latter purpo&s;e, an accurate arrangement became nece&s;&s;ary with France, and the money lenders in Holland, that the amount nece&s;&s;ary to be borrowed, might be a&s;certained with preci&s;ion.</P>
<P>It appeared, however, by the&s;e reports that he had violated the in&s;tructions of the Pre&s;ident, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, by borrowing upon the two million loan, though expre&s;sly confined by them to the other, and for the purpo&s;e of foreign debt only, precluding all idea of drawing any part of the monies borrowed into this country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> of the Pre&s;ident, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> Augu&s;t, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE>.&mdash;</P>

'Tis well known that the pul&s;e of the whole party beat in uni&s;on with him, as he advanced towards Paris, and that with him they were covered with &s;hame and mortification as he retreated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is an important and well known fact, that the &s;ucce&s;s of the Duke of Brun&s;wick, was mo&s;t earne&s;tly wi&s;hed for by the principal agents of this ari&s;tocratic and fi&s;cal party, who had not even the decency to con|ceal their &s;entiments upon the &s;ubject. Is it po&s;&s;ible that men of &s;uch principles can be friends to republican government any where, and that their influence &s;hould not be exerted to give a contrary tendency to the admini&s;tration of our own?</NOTE>. Or was it intended &s;olely to aid the

bank here, and tho&s;e &s;peculators his political a&s;&s;o|ciates, pre&s;&s;ed it is true by difficulties, and which were &s;ufficient to excite his &s;ympathy! Was it one or both of the&s;e objects which influenced his mea|&s;ures, for both were an&s;wered? Let facts &s;peak to an impartial and di&s;cerning public!</P>
<P>The very re&s;pectable and independent member, who had been mo&s;t active in pre&s;&s;ing this enquiry, con&s;idered it his duty to make known his &s;entiments of the&s;e tran&s;actions. Although the la&s;t of the long &s;eries of reports furni&s;hed, was not pre&s;ented more than four or five days before the clo&s;e of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, yet he deemed it incumbent on him, and con&s;i&s;tent with that candour which has always marked his cha|racter, to &s;hew in that &s;tage, the extent of his objec|tions to this gentleman's official conduct. With this view he laid on the table, and &s;ubject to the di&s;po&s;i|tion of the hou&s;e, &s;everal re&s;olutions &s;pecifying the&s;e objections. It was to be inferred, that on account of the &s;hort time intervening before the adjournment, and of cour&s;e, the impo&s;&s;ibility of examining, and thoroughly comprehending, all the various docu|ments relating to the &s;ubject, and of giving it that full and free di&s;cu&s;&s;ion its importance required, it was his wi&s;h the con&s;ideration &s;hould be po&s;tponed to the next &s;e&s;&s;ion. Upon this point, however, he appeared to be indifferent, becau&s;e he well knew the &s;ubject was now before another tribunal, who would do ju&s;tice to it. But the conduct of the hou&s;e which I deem important in the &s;cale of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, &s;hall now be noticed.</P>
<P>The fi&s;cal corps appeared to con&s;ider them&s;elves more critically circum&s;tanced than this member. They were obviou&s;ly &s;truck with con&s;ternation. To
<PB N="25" REF="026245_0024_0FCFAAF71AE262A0">
get rid of it altogether, they could not hope. To po&s;tpone it to the next &s;e&s;&s;ion, was what of all things they dreaded. It was before the public, who were intere&s;ted in the re&s;ult, and who would force a trial at one time or other. They therefore laid hold of it with avidity, and a &s;trong hand. If we now de|cide upon it, perhaps it may be deemed &s;atisfactory, and with us who are his friends, no danger need be apprehended. They &s;at day and night upon the re&s;olutions, until they got through them; and al|though they complained there was not &s;ufficient time for the inve&s;tigation, yet they hurried the deci&s;ion, in half the time remaining. The free latitude of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, practi&s;ed upon other occa&s;ions was refu&s;|ed; the &s;malle&s;t departure was cen&s;ured; and when|ever, in particular, an approach was made toward the bank, the whole party tumultuou&s;ly crying to order, and, with the directors at their head, ro&s;e in arms to defend it.</P>
<P>The character of the vote it&s;elf, which con&s;tituted this majority, is ea&s;ily given, by every per&s;on ac|quainted with that of the Hou&s;e, or with public tran&s;actions in general. Of the thirty five, twenty one were &s;tock-holders, or dealers in the funds, and three of the&s;e latter bank directors, and who&s;e degree of zeal was obviou&s;ly in the ratio above &s;ta|ted, as their relative profits; the bank directors, being con&s;iderably more active and zealous than the other members of the corps. That the fact, of this number being bank directors, is true, can it is be believed, be &s;atisfactorily &s;hewn. The public books however mu&s;t contain the evidence, unle&s;s entered in fictitious names, and by them let it be te&s;ted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The books of transfer at the Trea&s;ury, and the books at the bank, are held &s;ecret under the obligation of an oath, on all per&s;ons who u&s;e or in&s;pect them, not to reveal the names or amount of &s;tock-holders.

For the motive of their vote, &s;ufficient cau&s;e has alrea|dy been a&s;&s;igned. But for that of the other mem|bers, candour furni&s;hes an apology. The &s;hort &s;pace of time allowed for the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, to tho&s;e who had not previou&s;ly examined the &s;ubject, rendered it im|po&s;&s;ible for them to under&s;tand it: and in that &s;itua|tion it became their duty to vote on the favourable &s;ide. Be&s;ides, this was an affirmative propo&s;ition of cen&s;ure; had one of approbation been propo&s;ed to &s;anctify the&s;e proceedings, it would have been re&s;i&s;ted by tho&s;e thus circum&s;tanced, with equal force,
<PB N="27" REF="026245_0026_0FCFAAF421AFE2D8">
and mo&s;t probably have turned the majority, in like degree, the other way.</P>
<P>I have given a &s;ummary of the above proceedings, to evince the &s;olidity of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, and to demon&s;trate that a combination has been formed of a powerful faction, in two departments of the go|vernment, and upon principles dangerous to the rights and intere&s;ts of the community. That being founded on the ba&s;is of private intere&s;t, embracing a very exten&s;ive circle of &s;ociety, and which mu&s;t ac|quire additional &s;trength, in proportion as the pub|lic debt &s;hall be accumulated, its activity and force are the more to be dreaded. That its progre&s;s in undermining the great pillars of the government, by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an in&s;titution, in expre&s;s violation of its powers, and capable, as an engine of corruption, of &s;apping the foundation of public virtue, and polluting all its mea&s;ures, has been al|ready great. And that the con&s;equences to be ju&s;t|ly apprehended, unle&s;s a &s;peedy and efficacious re|medy &s;hall be applied, are really of the mo&s;t alarm|ing kind. In contemplation of the pernicious ten|dency of the&s;e mea&s;ures, with the a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ucce&s;s which had attended them, and their probable future extent, there was a period not far back, when I con|&s;idered the cau&s;e of liberty it&s;elf in danger, and trembled for the public &s;afety. I feared that the glo|rious fruits of the revolution, had been thrown a|way, by the blind confidence and temerity, of a ge|nerous and un&s;u&s;picious people. But I tru&s;t that our day of trial has pa&s;&s;ed, and that we may yet be &s;e|cure. To the manly efforts and di&s;intere&s;ted patriot|i&s;m, of tho&s;e who maintained the conflict, again&s;t &s;uch a combination of intere&s;ts, and checked its ra|pid career, much prai&s;e is due. America is &s;en&s;ible of their &s;ervices, and will remember their virtues. Thanks, illu&s;trious patriots, your country greets you
<PB N="28" REF="026245_0027_0FCFAAF2984B3530">
well, and will enrol your names upon the immortal records of fame!</P>
<P>By marking the extent of the evil, the cure is in a great mea&s;ure de&s;ignated. With the legi&s;lature &s;hould the correction commence, for <Q>whil&s;t that branch pre&s;erves its independence and integrity, we are &s;afe.</Q> Let us ca&s;t from it then, whatever impurities, tend to impair the&s;e qualities, or le&s;&s;en its re&s;pon&s;ibility to the people. Let the public creditors &s;tand apart, not as a cla&s;s of men to be branded with reproach and infamy, but as con&s;tituting an intere&s;t, which, without due re&s;traint, may endanger the ge|neral welfare; and if admi&s;&s;ible at all into that branch, let them be inhibited under the &s;evere&s;t penalties, from a profanation of its functions afterwards, by any traffic in the public funds. Let the law e&s;tabli&s;h|ing the bank, as a violation of the principles of the con&s;titution, be declared null and void, or at lea&s;t let the e&s;tabli&s;hment be repudiated from its pre&s;ent im|pure connection with the government. Let the whole &s;y&s;tem of the trea&s;ury department undergo a thorough reform, and the mo&s;t effectual guards be provided again&s;t tho&s;e liberties and abu&s;es, which have been charged, upon its pre&s;ent admini&s;tration. Let it be completely &s;ubjected to the &s;upreme head of the ex|ecutive, again&s;t which it &s;eems to have revolted, and let its communication with the legi&s;lature be put on a footing, more con&s;i&s;tent with the con&s;titu|tion, and the dignity and independence of the re|pre&s;entatives of the people. Renovations of this kind, will not violate public credit, but e&s;tabli&s;h it in the public confidence; will not impair the en|ergy of the con&s;titution, but re&s;tore it to its pri&s;tine health, and proper functions; will not &s;tain our na|tional character, but exhibit it, in its legitimate fea|tures, of a dignified &s;implicity, and genuine repub|licani&s;m.</P>
