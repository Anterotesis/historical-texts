</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AMONG human characters we &s;hall find but very few, who make nearer approaches to the exam|ple of our Lord, than the writer of this epi&s;tle. Soon after it plea&s;ed the GOD of all grace to reveal his Son in him, we find he was <HI>caught up to the third Heavens</HI> and there, he tells us <HI>he heard words which were unspeakable and unlawful for man to utter.</HI> From other hints in his hi&s;tory, it appears, that vi|&s;ions, revelations, and a prophetic &s;pirit were fre|quent with him, and through the whole of his life after his conver&s;ion, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an uncommon &s;hare of that grace which is common to all chri&s;tians, and in no accompli&s;hment did he come &s;hort of the very chiefe&s;t apo&s;tle.&mdash;Thus educated by communion with GOD in divine things, and the Holy Spirit giv|ing energy to his natural gifts, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing we &s;hould find that &s;eraphic zeal, fervent affection, and &s;aperior exertion, which were &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed in the life of this apo&s;tle, and advanced him &s;o near the &s;tandard of perfection, the example of Chri&s;t.&mdash;Well may we therefore pay great attention to the conduct of this illu&s;trious character, that we may copy his manner both in &s;pirit and exertion, and follow him wherein he followed Chri&s;t.&mdash;But in no ca&s;e is his example more worthy the imitation of all who are walled to a &s;imilar employment, than his manner of communicating the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">.&mdash;Of this he
<PB N="4" REF="033960_0003_0FF9BEBB6FF54C48">has given us a hint in the text.&mdash;After &s;ugge&s;ting to his brethren the manner of his coming among them, which was not with excellency of &s;peech, or wi&s;dom declaring unto them the te&s;timony of GOD, as he de|termined to know nothing among them, &s;ave Je&s;s Chri&s;t and him crucified, and was with them in weak|ne&s;s, and fear, and much trembling: He added as in the text&mdash;"And my &s;peech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wi&s;dom: but in demon&s;tration of the &s;pirit and of power."&mdash;</P>
<P>This manner at fir&s;t view, mu&s;t &s;trike our minds as highly excellent, and worthy of imitation, as it leaves out in general, whatever is un&s;uitable to &s;o important a work as preaching the go&s;pel, and com|pri&s;es whatever may give weight, and force to the pure precepts of truth.&mdash;It &s;hall be our bu&s;ine&s;s therefore on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion to illu&s;trate three particulars.</P>
<P N="1">I. The manner which the apo&s;tle di&s;owned as for|ming any part of his preaching (viz.) "Enticing words of man's wi&s;dom."</P>

They &s;ucceeded by an artful, in&s;inuating addre&s;s, and fallacious appearance of ar|gument. This manner after the &s;pread of chri&s;tian|ity, was found no le&s;s alluring to the people at large, than &s;ub&s;ervient to the carnal, &s;elfith ends of fal&s;e teachers. They adopted it as be&s;t calculated to pro|mote their private intere&s;t, reputation, or ea&s;e. In preaching what they wi&s;hed to palm upon the world as go&s;pel, they mingled <HI>this science falsely so called,</HI> and by enticing words of their own wi&s;dom drew off the minds of their hearers from the truth, as it is in Je&s;us, and fixed them on other objects.&mdash;Said the A|po&s;tle "They that are &s;uch, &s;erve not our Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, but their own belly and by good words, and fair &s;peeches, deceive the hearts of the &s;imple." &mdash;This manner ever &s;ince the apo&s;tle's time has been practi&s;ed by &s;uch, as through ignorance or ra&s;hne&s;s, have obtruded them&s;elves into the mini&s;try, <HI>without ever being called of</HI> GOD, <HI>or even knowing in the lea&s;t degree the power of Godliness upon their hearts.</HI> To convey the mo&s;t clear idea of this manner, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to adduce a few ca&s;es in which it is mo&s;t commonly di&s;played.&mdash;and</P>
<P>1&s;t. When the internal views of the preacher are to advance his own private intere&s;t, then his words are prone to be enticing, lea&s;t he &s;hould offend &s;uch, as are un&s;anctified among his opulent and influential friends and hereby endanger his worldly circum&s;tan|ces.</P>
<P>Whatever <HI>o&s;tensible motives natural men may ex|hibit</HI> as their inducements to preach the go&s;pel, yet, the <HI>real ones</HI> which actuate their hearts and govern their conduct are <HI>strictly selfish</HI>: and their &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and carnal wi&s;dom, <HI>will bear sway,</HI> and form the mo&s;t <HI>prominent features</HI> in their manner of preaching. In this ca&s;e therefore the preacher's own feelings and wi&s;dom <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> him to "prophecy &s;mooth things."
<PB N="6" REF="033960_0005_0FF9D8EFC7BBC450">To preach merely &s;uch moral duties as all men ap|prove &mdash;which admit of no di&s;pute&mdash;are good for ci|vil &s;ociety, and tend to promote good order. This is a plea&s;ing alluring manner. He is very &s;en&s;ible, that the di&s;tingui&s;hing doctrines of the go&s;pel, deliv|ered pointedly and pre&s;&s;ed according to their infinite importance give great unea&s;ine&s;s to the con&s;ciences of the wicked: hence in general, he con&s;iders it, the mo&s;t <HI>prudent way,</HI> either to pa&s;s over them <HI>wholly,</HI> or de&s;cribe them <HI>so faintly,</HI> that few or none will ap|prehend his meaning&mdash;This manner is enticing, as it diverts the minds of men from the e&s;&s;entials of &s;al|vation, and amu&s;es them with <HI>such doings,</HI> as are wholly deceitful con&s;idered as a title to Heaven.&mdash; It is enticing as it implies that tho&s;e moral virtues taught by heathen morali&s;ts an&s;wer men's duty to GOD, and receive this &s;anction from his word.&mdash;It is enticing al&s;o, as tho&s;e virtues &s;uit preci&s;ely <HI>the im|proved selfish feelings</HI> of all natural men: are heard with plea&s;ure by moral hypocrites and tend directly to &s;ettle them more and more upon their lees, and confirm them in the habits of &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s&mdash; Their con&s;ciences grow more &s;eared; they feel whole, and are "alive without the law."&mdash;Preachers who are thus calculating to &s;erve them&s;elves, and by <HI>good words and fair speeches,</HI> keep in perfect peace with their ungodly pari&s;hioners, treat the cardinal doct|rines of the go&s;pel as dangerous. Their maxims of carnal policy are <HI>Suit the times, Piease the people,</HI> and keep the <HI>Peace inviolably.</HI>&mdash;They really feel, that to preach the law of GOD in its nature and obliga|tions; to de&s;ine the nature of holine&s;s, and &s;in, and exhibit them <HI>plainly without disguise,</HI> and their eter|nal con&s;equences, would certainly give offence&mdash; cen&s;ure would en&s;ue&mdash;imprudence be charged upon them, and they &s;hould &s;uffer by it.&mdash;They <HI>really feel</HI> that &s;hould they exhibit plainly without di&s;gui&s;e the &s;overeignty of GOD, the total depravity of the human heart, regeneration, adoption, and &s;anctification, and the nece&s;&s;ity of an holy life, and pre&s;s them pointed|ly.
<PB N="7" REF="033960_0006_0FF9BEC3DCF24358">ly, it would plant arrows of conviction, or excite unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;gu&s;t in the minds of their hearers. Their carnal wi&s;dom therefore teaches them, it would be <HI>shockingly in prudent</HI> to hazard &s;uch prea|ching. Hence, when any of the&s;e docrrines come in their way, they lavi&s;h their enticing words, to rend|er them ob&s;eure, unintelligible or doubtful.&mdash;Their &s;y&s;tem of carnal prudence forbids that they &s;hould expre&s;s them pointedly, and dwell upon them plainly. But when their di&s;cour&s;e, or the complaints of the pious compel them to &s;ay &s;omething about them, they will do it by way of di&s;tant allu&s;ions: and be careful to expre&s;s the doctrine in view &s;o &s;aintly, that the mo&s;t critical can but ju&s;t di&s;cern their meaning, and the feebler mind is wholly bewildered and lo&s;t. Words of doubtful &s;ignifications, long circumlocu|tions, and &s;ubtle &s;ugge&s;tions are introduced to &s;heathe &s;uch points of go&s;pel truth, as are mo&s;t likely to pe|netrate and rou&s;e the con&s;ciences of the wicked. In &s;tead of awakening and rou&s;ing the &s;upine &s;inner, their bu&s;ine&s;s is to keep him &s;ecure, and flatter him that his moral virtues are plea&s;ing and acceptable to GOD.&mdash;Such preachers deem it imprudent to let the plain truths of the go&s;pel, beam upon men's con&s;cien|ces in their full &s;trength.&mdash;They think that the de|crees of GOD&mdash;the total depravity of the human heart &mdash;regeneration by the Holy Gho&s;t&mdash;and eternal pun|i&s;hment are &s;uch <HI>swords of the Spirit,</HI> that they will <HI>do hurt,</HI> if they are not kept &s;afely lodged in thick &s;cabbards of enticing words.&mdash;They never can be in|duced to be explicit on the&s;e points, or act in any degree as if they <HI>really believed</HI> them: But they will talk around about them with much plau&s;ibility &mdash;keep their own opinions out of &s;ight, by telling tho&s;e of other men, and loo&s;e their hearers in a wil|derne&s;s of general ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>Others again, who&s;e ultimate end in preaching is to enjoy life, free from the tumults of other occupa|tions, are ever enticing in their manner. A deep &s;en&s;e of their per&s;onal ea&s;e fills them with the utmo&s;t

So long as the heart of every natural man is enmity again&s;t GOD, it is at war with every truth of GOD rightly under&s;tood. How can &s;uch truths therefore allure? No, &s;uch preachers are obliged to entice, and allure by preaching &s;ome oth|er go&s;pel, in order to practice upon their own plan. And hence they &s;erve not our I ord Je&s;us Chri&s;t but their own intere&s;t, and are a dead weight on his cau&s;e. As a rea&s;on for this impious moral inoriguing, they in&s;inuate that the people cannot bear undi&s;gui&s;ed plainne&s;s&mdash;they will turn in&s;ane&mdash;rai&s;e per&s;ecution&mdash; embroil &s;ociety in endle&s;s di&s;putes and parties&mdash;and in &s;hort, the light in the candle&s;tick mu&s;t be removed or extingui&s;hed&mdash;I be mo&s;t eagle eyed prudence therefore mu&s;t guard again&s;t &s;uch calamities, and not endanger their worldly comforts or the public peace by preaching the di&s;tingui&s;hing doctrines of &s;alva|tion.</P>

This holy &s;pirit has left the image of the&s;e perfect|ions, as well as many others, on the law and go&s;pel of GOD, which he has revealed. To preach the go&s;|pel therefore, &s;o as that the &s;pirit of GOD &s;hould be <HI>seen, manifested and proved,</HI> is to preach it <HI>&s;imply,</HI> in its true nature, uncompounded of any thing contrary to it&mdash;to preach it <HI>purely,</HI> free from corroption or error&mdash;<HI>plainly,</HI> &s;o that every mind may apprehend it &mdash;<HI>searchingly,</HI> &s;o as to reach the heart and con|&s;cience &mdash;<HI>boldly,</HI> above the &s;ear or correction of car|nal wi&s;dom&mdash;<HI>ardently,</HI> feeling its excellence and im|portance &mdash;and <HI>efficaciously,</HI> being attended with di|vine influence in rene wing men's &s;ouls.</P>
<P>To preach the go&s;pel in this manner is to preach it, <HI>in demonstration of the spirit and of power.</HI> That
<PB N="13" REF="033960_0012_0FF9D920CE57C4A8">this was the manner claimed by the apo&s;tle as his practice will appear from hints and examples left on &s;acred record, of the particulars ju&s;t mentioned.&mdash;and</P>
<P>1&s;t. He preached the truths of the go&s;pel &s;imply, unmixed with ary thing contrary to them. Said he to his chri&s;tian friends at Galatia "I certify you brethren that the go&s;pel which was preached of me, is not after man, for I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t." The go&s;pel which the apo&s;tle preached he affirms was <HI>not after man,</HI> that is, according to man's depraved nature, wi&s;dom, and feelings: but it was holy like the law of GOD, to which the natural hearts of men are not &s;abject. This go&s;pel he did not receive from man, but from the teaching of Chri&s;t's &s;pirit.&mdash;In preaching it therefore he deliver|ed its doctrines in their &s;implicity as impre&s;&s;ed upon his mind by the Holy Gho&s;t&mdash;He exhibited Chri&s;t's character as divine, his offices, his atonement, his re|&s;urrection and a&s;ien&s;ion, and the whole coun&s;el of GOD in their &s;implicity, unmixed with human inven|tions. And hereby demon&s;trated the very &s;pirit, who&s;e image the&s;e doctrines bear.&mdash;Through the whole of divine revelation, this &s;implicity is mani|fe&s;ted; which is a kind of divine impre&s;&s;ure. deno|ting <HI>the truth, dignity, and property of the Deity</HI>&mdash; This impr<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">re <HI>stamped</HI> the apo&s;tle's doctrine as di|vine.&mdash;</P>

For if I yet plea&s;e men I &s;hould not be the &s;ervant of Chri&s;t." Penetrated with the importance of pre&s;erving the go&s;pel pure from all po&s;&s;ible error or corruption, he abhorred the idea of the brethren's admitting the lea&s;t deviation from the truths they had already received, on any pretence whatever. Although the apo&s;tles them&s;elves, or an angel from beaven, or any man &s;hould pretend they had &s;ome new di&s;coveries better, or more worthy their atten|tion, they were to <HI>let them all be accursed.</HI> But ful|ly con&s;cious of his own integrity he a&s;ks "Do I &s;eek to plea&s;e men, that is, "is it my manner as &s;ome would in&s;inuate to ingraciate my&s;elf into the good opinions of carnal men, by altering the doctrines of the go&s;pel &s;o as to plea&s;e their <HI>de|praved humors and feelings?</HI> Let all men judge of my couduct.

He could hardly &s;peak with &s;uffi|cient dete&s;tation of the idea that he endeavored to plea&s;e men in their &s;ins&mdash;he was perfectly &s;en&s;ible, he could not be the &s;ervant of Chri&s;t, any further than he exhibited his trath, unadulterated with hu|man additions. The pority of the traths he deliv|ed therefore demon&s;trated the Spirit by whom they were dictated.</P>
<P>3dly. Plainne&s;s al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed the manner of our apo&s;tle. Said he "I brethren when I came to you, came not with excellency of &s;peech or of man's wi&s;dom declaring unto you the te&s;timony of GOD, for I determined not to know any thing among you, &s;ave Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and him ernei&s;ied."

<PB N="15" REF="033960_0014_0FF9BED4493E2E30">he de&s;cribed: Being oceupied and affected with the&s;e, they thought nothing of the &s;peaker. The mo&s;t perfect &s;implicity of &s;tile ran through all his delineations of go&s;pel doctrines. When it is &s;aid by a brother apo&s;tle "that there were &s;ome things in his epi&s;tles, hard to be under&s;tood which the un|learned and un&s;table wre&s;t to their own de&s;truction." It is not to be under&s;tood, that tho&s;e things were rendered hard by the ob&s;curity, &s;ubtility, or di&s;gui&s;e, in which he delivered them, but they were hard through the &s;ublimity of the &s;ubjects upon which he treated. When he publi&s;hed the go&s;pel abroad a|mong the gentiles, or edified his brethren in &s;ettled churches, he dared not to preach in that flowery, brilliant &s;tile, adopted by fal&s;e teachers, or the &s;o|phi&s;t of his day, who&s;e object was to <HI>display them|selves.</HI> He dared not di&s;gui&s;e and blur the te&s;timo|ny of GOD, by &s;hewing his &s;kill in oratory, or fine compo&s;ition, or making him&s;elf admired for his gifts &mdash;He feared to di&s;gui&s;e go&s;pel doctrines by enticing words of man's wi&s;dom: he knew that his own &s;oul mu&s;t pay for &s;uch perfidy. Said he, "As we were allowed of GOD, to be put in tru&s;t with the go&s;pel, <HI>even so we speak,</HI> not as <HI>pleasing men but</HI> GOD, who trieth our hearts; for neither at any time u&s;ed we flattering words, as ye know&mdash;nor a cloke of cove|toa&s;ne&s;s GOD is witne&s;s&mdash;Nor of men &s;ought we glo|ry, neither of you, nor yet of others." It never was apparent that &s;ometimes his words were &s;haped to plea&s;e the carnal ta&s;tes of his hearers, as a cloke of covetou&s;ne&s;s to gain their worldly intere&s;t; and at another to command their applan&s;e. His very &s;oul <HI>detested that downy preaching which sews pillows to all armholes, and barters Heaven, the blood of Christ, the souls of men and the glory of God,</HI> for the empty puffs of human approbation. On the other hand, he loved the truth&mdash;he loved his GOD and Savior&mdash;he loved the &s;ouls of men, and dealt out the bread of life, in the plaine&s;t manner, and "long|ed for all his hearers in the bowels of Je&s;us Chri&s;t."
<PB N="16" REF="033960_0015_0FF9D94332ED1048">He determined to know nothing among any people, but <HI>Christ Jesus and him crucified.</HI> In illultrating Chri&s;t's per&s;on, offices, and crucifixion, and the infi|nitely weighty truths connected with them, he had no u&s;e for excellency of &s;peech or carnal wi&s;dom. The&s;e were utterly un&s;uitable here. Simplicity, &s;o|lemnity, and ardor, were the only ornaments admi&s;&s;i|ble.

In&s;tead of endeavoring to hide the truths of the go&s;pel and make them &s;it ea&s;y upon the con&s;ciences of the wicked, like fal&s;e teach|ers, it was his chief de&s;ign, to exhibit them in their <HI>native brightness,</HI> and direct them with all their force to the hearts of his auditory, and di&s;turb with cutting conviction the mo&s;t &s;tupid &s;inner.

<P>5thly. His boldne&s;s, and undaunted re&s;olution in preaching the go&s;pel likewi&s;e marked his manner. &mdash;Before Kings, Governors, and chief Captains, Jewi&s;h courts, and every in&s;trument of per&s;ecution and torture, he &s;poke with freedom and energy. When arraigned before Nero the Roman Emperor; that mon&s;ter of &s;avage barbarity; Said the apo&s;tle "At my fir&s;t an&s;wer, no man &s;tood with me: but all men for&s;ook me; I pray God, that it might not be laid to their charge. Notwith&s;tanding the Lord &s;tood with me, and &s;trengthened me, that by me <HI>the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gen|tiles might hear</HI>: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion." While even friends for&s;ook him through fear; and &s;urrounded with enemies who thir&s;ted for his blood; and wholly uncertain how his trial would turn, either in life or death&mdash;<HI>even here,</HI> &s;trengthened by his Lord, he let the preaching of the go&s;pel be <HI>fully known, so that all the Gentiles might hear.</HI> Borne up with a &s;en&s;e of duty to his great Lord, and Ma&s;ter, in the di&s;charge of his com|mi&s;&s;ion to the gentiles, <HI>he feared not the face of man</HI>: nor &s;uffered his feelings or utterance to be daunt|ed by the pro&s;pect of death, in all its horrors.&mdash;Like the Holy Spirit, by whom he was in&s;pired, he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed a magnanimity of &s;oul, an holy elevation, infinitely above the vengeance of a world&mdash; This elevation was con&s;picuous not only in his preaching, and &s;cenes of danger in every place, but
<PB N="19" REF="033960_0018_0FF9BEE6BA8794E0"><HI>it pervades</HI> all his writings in the facred volume. It could not be told by his &s;tile or manuer, that he ever &s;u&s;pected there were &s;uch a race of beings as <HI>critics,</HI> or that the truths he delivered were liable to injury or abu&s;e. <HI>The dignity of the word of God and its importance filled his soul, and he thought of nothing else</HI>&mdash;But,</P>
<P>6thly. The ardor with which he pur&s;ued the ob|jects of his mini&s;try further illu&s;trates his manner. His heart being filled with love to Chri&s;t, the &s;ouls of men, and the glory of GOD, he preached, agoni|zed, and &s;uffered in the fervor of this love, and let no worldly concerns divert him from the objects of it. Said he "What things were gain to me once, the&s;e I count lo&s;s for Chri&s;t&mdash;yea, doubtle&s;s, I count all things but lo&s;s, for the excellency of the knowl|edge of Chri&s;t Je&s;us my Lord, for whom I have &s;uf|fered the lo&s;s of all things, and do count them but dung that I may win Chri&s;t." The lo&s;s of all tem|poral goods, worldly honor, and ea&s;e, were not worth mentioning when put in competition with Chri&s;t. He counted them all <HI>but dross and dirt.</HI> This &s;inglene&s;s of affection for his Lord, made him preach with the <HI>ardor</HI> of a &s;eraph. To dwell upon the glories of Chri&s;t's divinity, his offices, and atone|ment, and their ble&s;&s;ed con&s;equences in the &s;alvation of <HI>lost men who repent,</HI> was the riche&s;t fea&s;t of his &s;oul. On the other hand, he agonized, and &s;ome|times lengthened out his &s;peech till break of day, in per&s;uading mi&s;erable &s;inners to be reconciled to God. Said he to the Elders of Ephe&s;us "Ye know from the fir&s;t day I came into A&s;ia, after what man|ner I have been with you at all &s;ea&s;ons. Serving the Lord with all humility, and with many tears and temptations which befel me; and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, and have taught you publicly and from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, te&s;tify|ing both to the Jews and al&s;o to the Greeks, repent|ance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and remember, that by the &s;pace of <HI>three
<PB N="20" REF="033960_0019_0FF9D9846939CD70">years</HI> I cea&s;ed not to <HI>warn every one, night and day with tears.</HI> This &s;hewed the <HI>ardor</HI> with which he <HI>per&s;uaded and entreated</HI> peri&s;hing &s;ouls to come to Chri&s;t. And "Now, &s;ays he, I go bound in the Spirit to Jeru&s;alem, not knowing the things which &s;hall befall me there, &s;ave that the Holy Gho&s;t wit|ne&s;&s;eth in every city, that bonus, and a&s;&s;lictions abide me. But none of the&s;e things move me, neither count I my life dear unto my&s;elf, &s;o that I might fini&s;h my cour&s;e with joy, and the mini&s;try, which I have received of the Lord Je&s;us to te&s;tify the go&s;|pel of the grace of GOD." After rehear&s;ing the manner in which he had labored among them, his &s;oul anticipated the trials he was about to endure at Jeru&s;alem. But no &s;ooner are they mentioned, than his <HI>ztal and fortitude burst forth</HI> in an holy tri|umph, <HI>but none of these things move me!</HI> like the rock in the mid&s;t of the ocean, again&s;t which the billows <HI>beat and da&s;h,</HI> but cannot <HI>move.</HI> And when his brethren at Ce&s;aria would di&s;&s;uade him from his purpo&s;e of going to Jeru&s;alem he replied, "What meanye, to weep and break mine heart? For I am ready not to be <HI>bound only,</HI> but al&s;o to <HI>die</HI> at Jeru&s;alem for the name of Je&s;us."&mdash;The&s;e in&s;tances in which the warmth of his heart led him to expre&s;s the truths of the go&s;pel, and pur&s;ue the glory of his Lord in building up his cau&s;e, <HI>ar above comment.</HI> His very <HI>soul glowed</HI> with that &s;pirit of truth and love, which he demon&s;trated in every di&s;cour&s;e, and be pur&s;ued his object till he laid down his life in the cau&s;e.&mdash;</P>
<P>Finally. His manner of preaching in demon|&s;tration of the Spirit was al&s;o attended with the <HI>power</HI> of GOD in renewing men's &s;ouls and preparing them &s;or Heaven. Said he, to his Corinthian brethren "Though you have ten thou&s;and in&s;tructors in Chri&s;t, yet have ye not ma|ny fathers, for in Chri&s;t Je&s;us I have begotten you through the go&s;pel." And again "Ye are manife&s;t|ly declared to be the epi&s;tle of Chri&s;t mini&s;tered by us&mdash;written not with ink, but with the Sprit of the
<PB N="21" REF="033960_0020_0FF9BEEE30D23EC8">living GOD&mdash;not in tables of &s;tone, but in fle&s;hly ta|bles of the heart." The power of the Holy Gho&s;t accompanied the truths preached, and cau&s;ed them to &s;pring forth in an harve&s;t of &s;ouls.&mdash;GOD was plea|&s;ed &s;ignally to own and ble&s;s the apo&s;tle's mini&s;tra|tions of divine truth for the <HI>great end</HI> of preaching, and hereby he <HI>demonstrated the power</HI> of the holy Spirit in the actual &s;alvation of multitudes. This manner in all its branches, the apo&s;tle claimed as his <HI>own practice,</HI> in di&s;tinction from that of fal&s;e teach|ers. <HI>Said he,</HI> "my &s;peech, and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wi&s;dom, but in demon&s;tration of the Spirit and of power."&mdash;It was propo&s;ed in the</P>
<P N="3">III. Place to &s;hew why the apo&s;tle preferred this latter mode. The rea&s;on given to the brethren in the context is, "That their faith &s;hould not &s;tand in the wi&s;dom of men but in the power of God."&mdash;That is, he preached the go&s;pel <HI>simply, purely, plainly, pointedly, boldly, and ardently,</HI> that their faith in Chri&s;t, might not re&s;t, in the rea&s;onings and per&s;ua&s;ions of <HI>carnal wisdom,</HI> but &s;hould be the effect of the power of GOD, <HI>attending</HI> a manife&s;tation of his truth. A faith which has its origin <HI>here</HI> is genuine. It will always be &s;trengthened by the pure doctrines of chri&s;tianity&mdash;will work by love &mdash;overcome the world&mdash;<HI>and life, till heaven opens on the soul.</HI> But <HI>every faith</HI> which &s;tands in the wi&s;dom of men, or is grounded in <HI>human persuasion,</HI> will <HI>die</HI> like the meteor, which fla&s;hes but for a mo|ment. &mdash;It only remains that the above example, be recommended to our imitation by the following mo|tives. &mdash;And</P>
<P>1&s;t. The motive which the apo&s;tle him&s;elf ac|knowledged as influential on him, mu&s;t be &s;triking, and coer&s;ive on <HI>all</HI> who are engaged in a &s;imilar em|ployment. Why is the go&s;pel publi&s;hed <HI>at all,</HI> ex|cept it is to be heard; &s;o that mankind may be impre&s;&s;ed by it, and believe it to their &s;alvation? But if this is the de&s;ign of its publication, then it
<PB N="22" REF="033960_0021_0FF9D9A735EDE880">is plainly the duty of every one to whom it is com|mitted, to publi&s;h it <HI>in demonstration of the spirit and of power.</HI> Men's faith cannot &s;tand in the power of GOD, unle&s;s this power produce it. And the apo&s;tle intimated we have no right to expect this power to attend where the &s;pirit of truth is not exhibited. Con&s;equently unle&s;s tho&s;e who pretend to preach the go&s;pel, do it after the manner of the apo&s;tle, they may as well cea&s;e from their labors. For the very de&s;ign of their preaching is defeated.&mdash;Unle&s;s that particular mode be adopted which GOD has enjoined, and which he will own and &s;ucceed by affording the operations of his holy Spirit, it is in vain to attempt to preach: nay, for per&s;ons de&s;ignedly to deviate from this manner, through the influence of their own <HI>carnal wisdom,</HI> thinking that they are competent to make <HI>improvements upon</HI> GOD'S <HI>plan,</HI> is <HI>horred trifling with sacred things</HI>; and de&s;tructive to the highe&s;t intere&s;ts of men's &s;ouls. How powerful therefore is this motive to enforce an imitation of the apo&s;tle.</P>
<P>2d. The example of Chri&s;t is a motive to it. Did not our Lord him&s;elf &s;et the patern before the apo&s;tle? "Never man &s;pake like" him. How per|fectly he under&s;tood his Fathers will? In him was "Hid all the trea&s;ures of wi&s;dom and knowledge." He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Holy Spirit without mea&s;ure. His words were <HI>spirit and life.</HI> How &s;imply and purely did he communicate the truth&mdash;how plainly to the reception of every mind&mdash;how pointedly and pun|gently to the heart? He never mi&s;&s;ed his de&s;ign. He ever knew the &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of the &s;oul, and when he directed a &s;entence to the con&s;cience, it was irre&s;i&s;table. The Scribes and Phari&s;ces, the young morali&s;t and every hypocrite, were witne&s;&s;es of this. How he agonized in preaching and prayer for his &s;heep&mdash;how <HI>undaunted</HI> all his conduct zeal and love for his father's glory filled his heart. The power of the Holy Gho&s;t ever attended his word, and all whom the Father had given him he
<PB N="23" REF="033960_0022_0FF9D9B8917F37B0">irre&s;i&s;tably drew. How infinitely forcible is this example to &s;timulate all his Amba&s;&s;adors to an imi|tation of it. The apo&s;tle Paul felt its impul&s;e in every faculty, and <HI>his sensibility</HI> was but the <HI>duty</HI> of every &s;ervant of the Lord Je&s;us.</P>
<P>3dly. The rules of GOD'S word, enjoin this man|ner. "Go preach the preaching I bid thee." How can the di&s;ciple deviate from this command, <HI>in mat|ter or manner?</HI> "What I tell you in darkne&s;s, that &s;peak ye in light, and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the hou&s;e tops, And fear not them that kill the body"&mdash;Preach the word, be in&s;tant in &s;ea&s;on, out of &s;ea&s;on; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long &s;uffering and doctrine&mdash;"Make full proof of thy mini&s;try&mdash;give thy&s;elf wholly to the&s;e things &mdash;Take heed unto thy&s;elf, and unto thy doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this, thou &s;halt &s;ave thy&s;elf and them that hear thee." It is impo&s;&s;ible to be a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t without putting the&s;e rules in practice in &s;ome good degree. And this is follow|ing our apo&s;tle wherein he followed Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>4thly. To imitate his example is the only method which is &s;uitable to the great doctrines of the go&s;pel&mdash; &s;uch as the character and offices of the adorable Trini|ty &mdash;the laws of GOD&mdash;the death of Chri&s;t&mdash;his re&s;ur|rection and a&s;cen&s;ion&mdash;the lo&s;t &s;tate of man&mdash;eternal happine&s;s and interminable mi&s;ery. It is ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary for preachers who pretend to believe the&s;e doctrines, and would keep up any coun&s;i&s;tancy between their belief and practice, that they follow the apo&s;tle and preach the&s;e doctrines, as he did, according to their gi&s;ts, <HI>in demonstration of the spirit and of power.</HI> Mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel are cal|led in &s;ome &s;en&s;e to &s;land in the light, "even as GOD is in the light." They &s;tand in the pre&s;ence of GOD, and of Chri&s;t <HI>always,</HI> and in the pre&s;ence of his word. Their faces ought to &s;hine, as the face of Mo&s;es when he de&s;cended from the mount; and expre&s;s in all their conver&s;ation the unction of the Holy Spirit. And as they are called likewi&s;e to

Preachers who can pa&s;s over the&s;e &s;olemn &s;ubjects, and amu&s;e their hearers with cold conci&s;e &s;peculations on mere morality&mdash;who can trifte with the doctrines of &s;al|vation &mdash;preach with enticing words of man's wi&s;|dom &mdash;live on the houors which come from men, <HI>and cry peace peace to the wicked,</HI> give the lie to their bible. There is &s;uch an utter incon&s;i&s;tency be|tween &s;uch a method of preaching and a realizing belief of the &s;criptures, that every awakened con|&s;cience proclaims, that they are unbelievers.

<P>It calls up our attention <HI>Rev. Fathers and Brethren</HI> to the manner in which we fulfill our mini&s;try.&mdash; Which of the modes de&s;cribed by the apo&s;tle do we practice? Are we &s;ecretly moved in our preaching by an <HI>ultimate view</HI> to our temporal intere&s;t, honor, or ea&s;e? Do we con&s;ider it of &s;upreme importance to be <HI>so prudent,</HI> or &s;o carnally wi&s;e, <HI>as not to disturb unbelievers?</HI> e&s;pecially our <HI>opulent, unsanctified hear|ers?</HI> If we &s;peak what our con&s;ciences dictate as truth, yet, do we not de&s;ignedly &s;peak it in &s;uch a <HI>guarded way,</HI> that its edge &s;hall not be &s;elt by <HI>those
<PB N="26" REF="033960_0025_0FF9D9ECF0B75428">who love it not?</HI> Said our Lord "<HI>The world cannot receive the spirit of truth</HI>: they hate the light neither come they to the light." Yet, do we not de&s;ignedly expre&s;s the truth &s;o <HI>coolly, cautiously or obscurely,</HI> that the world &s;hall receive it and <HI>shall not hate the light?</HI> Such attempts no donbt are performed with enticing words of man's wi&s;dom.

Further, do we not endeavor to e&s;cape cen&s;ure by preaching in &s;uch <HI>general,</HI> or <HI>equivocal terms,</HI> as may &s;uit <HI>all kinds of religious sentiments?</HI> May not our minds be a&s;pir|ing after the fame of Philo&s;ophers, great orators, or elegant compo&s;ui&s;ts?

If the&s;e things predomi|nate in our hearts and practice, <HI>is it not clear</HI> that we have been following our own wi&s;dom; and hereby prevented the faith of many &s;tanding in the power of GOD?

And if GOD is to try our hearts, and avenge &s;uch blood upon unfaithful watchmen, to all eternity, then, the&s;e queries cannot be thought un&s;uitable by all, who <HI>believe and feel this solemn truth.

How can he meet the &s;ouls whom he has ruin|ed, in the regions of the damned? Imagination can|not paint the horror of &s;uch Juda&s;es&mdash;<HI>such castaways</HI> from GOD. And then to look forward, it is the Hell of hell, to con&s;ider, that the&s;e horrors will never cea&s;e. Do not our &s;ouls &s;hudder in view of the fear|ful &s;cene? and cry "<HI>Lord Jesus, Saviour of sinners, save us from this practice, and this end.</HI>" On the o|ther hand, can we claim as our apo&s;tle, that our man|ner of exhibiting divine truth is in demon&s;tration of the &s;pirit and of power? Does Chri&s;t fill our hearts, and fill our di&s;cour&s;es? Doth the love we bear to him and his truth extingui&s;h every idea of preaching
