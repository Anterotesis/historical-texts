<P>Major General ST. CLAIR pleads NOT GUILTY.</P>
<P>The Judge Advocate &s;tates the matters upon which the charges again&s;t the General are founded, as follow:</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary (previous to my producing the requi&s;ite evidence on this trial) that I &s;hould inform you of the matters, upon which the charges again&s;t Major General St. Clair are founded. They are certain remarks, made by a committee of the Hon. the Continental Congre&s;s, appointed to examine the evidence collected, and to &s;tate charges again&s;t the general officers who were in the northern department when Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were evacuated.</P>
<P>Before I mention the&s;e remarks, I would inform you that Major General St. Clair, on or about the 13th day of June, 1777, took upon him the command of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, and that the&s;e places were evacuated to the enemy by his orders on the 6th day of July following.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t remark is: That on the 13th day of June General St. Clair was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an information from two pri&s;oners taken in Canada, that the Briti&s;h forces, amounting to about 10,000 men, were proceeding as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible again&s;t him, and that he might expect their arrival in three weeks at farthe&s;t. That as on the 18th of June four of the enemy's ve&s;&s;els were lying on the hither &s;ide of Split Rock, and on the 24th &s;even of them were at Crown-Point, and others four or five miles lower down, their forces then encamped on both &s;ides of Gilleland's Creek, and he was informed by his &s;couts that they were very numerous; &s;o from the&s;e circum&s;tances it appears General St. Clair had &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;on to confide in what the pri&s;oners had told him
<PB N="4" REF="016141_0003_0F9B776CC0376B80">
relative to the intentions and &s;trength of the enemy; and that he ought at this time to have taken his final re&s;olution, either to &s;tand an attack, or to retreat with his &s;tores, the pre&s;ervation of which was a principal object in the determination of a council of war on the 20th of June. Therefore it appears that General St. Clair's neglecting to form his deci&s;ive opinion at this time, or at a later day, &s;o as to allow him a &s;ufficient opportunity to retreat with his troops, &s;ick, ammunition, cannon, provi&s;ions and cloathing, and to deprive the enemy of &s;helter at Ticonderoga, was a neglect of duty.</P>
<P><HI>Second.</HI> That General St. Clair, on the 24th of June, was informed by his &s;couts the enemy were very numerous and yet, neverthele&s;s, on the next day he wrote to Congre&s;s, that he was not able to di&s;cover whether the enemy were in force or not.</P>
<P><HI>Third.</HI> That if General St. Clair found &s;mall &s;couts could not acquire a knowledge whether the enemy were in force or not, it was his duty in due time to have &s;ent out reconnoitering parties, in &s;uch force as might have a&s;&s;ured him whether or not the enemy were in &s;trength, this being a mo&s;t important point, as upon this he was to regulate his motions; and therefore his failure in &s;ending out &s;uch parties in due time was a neglect of duty.</P>
<P><HI>Fourth.</HI> That as Je&s;&s;e Leavenworth &s;wears General St. Clair did not annoy the enemy in their advance again&s;t, and inve&s;titure of, the po&s;ts under his care, although the troops were healthy, courageous, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of action, it appears the General did not to the utmo&s;t of his power oppo&s;e the operations of the enemy; and therefore that he is liable to the charge of neglect of duty, of cowardice, or of treachery, or of incapacity as a General.</P>
<P><HI>Fifth.</HI> That as it was determined in a council of war on the twentieth of June, approved by General Schuyler, the commanding officer in the department, that the repairing the old and adding new works on Mount Independence ought to claim immediate attention; and Je&s;&s;e Leavenworth &s;wears not a &s;troke was &s;truck for tho&s;e purpo&s;es; and by the orderly book it appears the fatigue party was decrea&s;ed in number, and continued &s;o at a time when it &s;hould have been abundantly increa&s;ed; &s;o on the&s;e points the General is liable to be charged with a neglect of duty, amounting to a breach of orders, and with treachery.</P>
<P><HI>Sixth.</HI> That as on the 25th of May, the Deputy Commi&s;&s;ary rated that 1400 barrels of flour would, at an allowance of one pound each man <HI>per diem,</HI> &s;erve 4000 men 66 days, and that 661 barrels of beef would &s;erve the &s;ame number of men 75 days; and &s;uppo&s;ing that, from the twentieth of June to the fourth of July inclu&s;ive, there were in Ticonderoga and Mount Independence 4739 men, and there does not appear to have been at any time between the&s;e periods a greater number; &s;o e&s;timating the con&s;umption of 4739 men, from the twentieth of June to the fourth of July inclu&s;ive, upon the 2015 barrels of flour, 195 barrels of beef, and 784 barrels of pork, on the twentieth of June returned by Deputy Commi&s;&s;ary Yancey as then actually remaining on hand, there did on the fourth of July remain, or ought, if provi&s;ions had been regularly and properly i&s;&s;ued, to be then remaining 1625 barrels of flour, 3 barrels of beef, and 784 barrels of pork; a magazine of provi&s;ions &s;ufficient to afford to the army on the fifth of July, amounting, by the arrival of the militia of the Grants, to 5639 men of all ranks, <HI>fall allowance</HI> of provi&s;ion in flour for 52 days, and in beef and pork for 32 days, exclu&s;ive of the con&s;iderable number of fat cattle that arrived at Ticonderoga on the fifth of July, the teams of oxen nece&s;&s;arily attending the po&s;t, and other &s;tores &s;pecified in the Commi&s;&s;ary's return on the twentieth of June, and even &s;uppo&s;ing, as may not rea&s;onably be done, that no &s;upply of flour had arrived after that day. And as this calculation has been liberally made, upon the quantity of provi&s;ions actually in Ticonderoga on the twentieth of June, for the expenditure of which General St. Clair, as commander at the po&s;t, ought to be held re&s;pon&s;ible; therefore it clearly appears Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were not abandoned upon the ju&s;t principle of a want of provi&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>Seventh.</HI> That as General St. Clair informed the Hon. Mr. Jay, that at the time of holding the council of war on the 5th of July he knew it to be impo&s;&s;ible to defend the po&s;ts with his numbers, it is natural to conclude he was decided upon this point as early as the 29th of June, the day that he &s;ent his &s;on and pri|vate effects from Ticonderoga to Fort-George, as a place of &s;afety: That being decided upon this point, it was his duty then to have taken as effectual mea&s;ures for the pre&s;ervation of the public property, at lea&s;t equally with his own, claiming his earlie&s;t attention: That on the 30th of June, the enemy being ad|vancing again&s;t him &s;o near as the Three-mile-point, it is incredible that he did not then know that they were in force: That it was his duty, <HI>at that point of time,</HI> to have finally determined either to abide the operations of the enemy, or to retire: That if the la&s;t re&s;olution was taken, and, from his &s;ending off his &s;on and baggage the day before, there is the &s;tronge&s;t pre&s;umption that this re&s;olution was <HI>then</HI> fully taken, it was his duty then to have proceeded to &s;end off the public &s;tores, to de&s;troy the works, and to evacuate the po&s;ts without lo&s;ing a moment of time: And that by deferring to take any mea&s;ures to retire till the la&s;t moment when he could po&s;&s;ibly retreat even with his effective troops, a moment when the &s;ick, ammu|nition, cannon, provi&s;ion and cloathing of the army mu&s;t be abandoned and lo&s;t, be&s;ides the lives of many men in effecting a retreat from before an enemy immediately upon him, General St. Clair appears charge|able with inattention to the progre&s;s of the enemy, with treachery, or with incapacity as a General, and with &s;hamefully abandoning the po&s;ts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, in his charge. Nor can the proving, as General St. Clair wi&s;hes to do, that the works of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were too exten&s;ive, and that the troops were very badly armed, if &s;uch things can be proved, fail of placing General St. Clair in a more reprehen&s;ible point of view, as the weakne&s;s of his defence being more obvious, his retreat &s;hould have been the earlier determined upon.</P>
<P>The charge of neglect of duty is founded on the fir&s;t, third, fourth and fifth remarks re&s;pectively.&mdash; Cowardice, treachery, incapacity as a General, re&s;pectively, are founded upon the fourth remark.&mdash; Treachery, founded upon the fifth remark.&mdash;Inattention to the progre&s;s of the enemy, treachery, inca|pacity as a General, re&s;pectively, founded upon the &s;eventh remark.&mdash;Shamefully abandoning the po&s;ts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, in his charge, founded upon the &s;eventh remark.</P>
<P>Major General St. Clair reque&s;ts that the Re&s;olution of Congre&s;s of the 5th of February la&s;t, appointing two Coun&s;ellors learned in the law to a&s;&s;i&s;t and co-operate with the Judge Advocate in the trial of the General

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON the 13th in&s;tant I wrote to William Patter&s;on and Jonathan D. Serjeant, E&s;quires, Attorney Generals for Jer&s;ey and Penn&s;ylvania, by expre&s;s, and tran&s;mitted a copy of the Re&s;olution which you mention, no|tifying them at the &s;ame time, that General St. Clair's trial would come on to-day. I have received an an&s;wer from Mr. Patter&s;on, by which he declines attending. From Mr. Serjeant I have not heard. The letter to him I inclo&s;ed to the care of Mr. Laurens, Pre&s;ident of Congre&s;s, with a reque&s;t that it might be forwarded to him, as I did not know in what part of Penn&s;ylvania he then was.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED><HI>I am, Sir, Your mo&s;t obedient Servant,</HI> GEORGE WASHINGTON.</SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<P><LABEL>P. S.</LABEL> The Pre&s;ident received my letter of the 13th, which inclo&s;ed Mr. Serjeant's, and I am informed di&s;patched it by expre&s;s.</P>
</POSTSCRIPT></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The letters being read, Major General St. Clair addre&s;&s;es the Court as follows:</P>
<P>THE re&s;olution that has ju&s;t been read is of &s;o &s;ingular a nature, that I cannot pa&s;s it by without &s;ome ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>The treatment I have received renders it nece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;ubmit to any regulation that may have been pre&s;cribed, as an objection on my part would probably be con&s;trued into the fear of a thorough inve&s;tigation, and con&s;equently an evidence of guilt. I &s;hall therefore make no objection to the learned gentlemen, &s;hould they attend, a&s;&s;i&s;ting and co-operating with the Judge Advocate in my trial: But, as I conceive this to be introducing a very great change in the mode of proceeding before Courts Martial, I cannot con&s;ent that Congre&s;s have any power to make that change.</P>
<P>Courts Martial were con&s;tituted by the fir&s;t article of the 14th &s;ection of the rules and articles for the go|vernment of the troops, and the mode of proceeding in them by the third article of the &s;ame &s;ection. The&s;e articles every officer is obliged to &s;ub&s;cribe, whereby they become a compact betwixt the army and the people, and cannot be altered but by common con&s;ent; and a re&s;olve of Congre&s;s has no more operation upon them than an edict of the Grand Turk. But a power to alter the ordinary cour&s;e of proceeding for a par|ticular ca&s;e is big with con&s;equences of the mo&s;t dangerous nature, and might be made an in&s;trument of the mo&s;t grievous oppre&s;&s;ion. I do therefore, on behalf of the army, &s;olemnly prote&s;t again&s;t my having &s;ub|mitted to this innovation ever hereafter being drawn into precedent.</P>
<P>Major General St. Clair admits he took the command of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence on or about the 13th day of June, 1777, and that the&s;e po&s;ts were evacuated by his orders the 6th day of July following.</P>
<P>The Judge Advocate produces copies of letters from Major General St. Clair to Major General Schuyler, dated June 13th, June 18th, and June 24th, 1777; al&s;o a copy of a letter from Major General St. Clair to Congre&s;s, dated June 25th, 1777; a copy of a letter from General St. Clair to Major General Schuyler, dated June 30th, 1777; the proceedings of a Council of Officers held at Ticonderoga the 20th of June, 1777; a &s;tate of the guards and fatigue party, June 15th, 1777, from a copy of General St. Clair's orderly book; al&s;o an order from the &s;aid orderly book re&s;pecting the guards and fatigue party, June 23d, 1777: which, being read, are as follow:</P>

<PB N="6" REF="016141_0005_0F9B776E4B6E6C10">
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Ticonderoga,</HI>
<DATE><HI>June</HI> 13, 1777.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear General,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HERE follows the &s;ub&s;tance of the information given by two men from Canada, taken pri&s;oners by one of our parties on Onion River.</P>
<P>That General Burgoyne it arrived in Canada, but has brought no troops with him; that the Briti&s;h army is a&s;&s;embling as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible at St. John's; that the light infantry, which they call the flying army, commanded by General Frazer, is already advanced to Point-au-Fer; that the whole army is &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of about ten thou&s;and men, a part of which, with Indians under the command of Sir John John&s;on, and Canadians under Captain Mackay, are to penetrate the country by the Mohawk River whil&s;t the re&s;t of the army under General Burgoyne cro&s;&s;es the Lake to attack this place; that their fleet (a particular account of which is in the inclo&s;ed letter to General Sullivan) is all in the Lake, and we may depend on their being here in a fortnight at farthe&s;t.</P>
<P>From the nature and circum&s;tance of the pa&s;s granted to one of the two, which I here inclo&s;e, and his own account of the manner in which he was &s;ent from Montreal, viz. to &s;earch plans of the country which he pretended to know are hid at Metcalf's, and his being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a con&s;iderable &s;um of continental money, and &s;ome gold and &s;ilver, I have the &s;tronge&s;t &s;u&s;picion of his being a &s;py, and have &s;ecured him <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uch, and &s;ent him down to you, both that you might have an opportunity to examine him your&s;elf, and that, if you &s;hould think of him as I do, he might be tried at Albany, where, &s;hould he be found guilty, the &s;entence will probably be more adequate to the crime than here; for I find the officer, who lately &s;uffered a &s;py he had in charge to e&s;cape, through the gro&s;&s;e&s;t mi&s;conduct, has been honourably ac|quited by a Court Martial.</P>
<P>You will likewi&s;e find a letter from Col. Bailey, containing the intelligence brought by two Frenchmen &s;ent down by General Gates. Though their intelligence differs very materially, they agree in the circum&s;tance of General Burgoyne's arrival; and if the&s;e fellows have really been &s;ent by him to &s;ee what we were about, there was no method more likely to procure them an ea&s;y reception than that of giving an account of the preparations in Canada, and carrying, or pretending to carry, letters from our friends. The letter to General Sullivan may notwith&s;tanding be genuine, and Am&s;bury &s;ays it was written by one Michael Shannon. This name was found upon him on a &s;eparate piece of paper, in a fair hand, which he &s;eemed unwilling to part with, and which I &s;uppo&s;e to have been a private &s;ignal by which he was to be known upon his return.</P>
<P>If the enemy intend to attack us, I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, we are very ill prepared to receive them. The whole amount of continental troops, fit for duty, is 1576 rank and file, exclu&s;ive of Baldwin's artificers and Whitcomb's 52 rangers. Be&s;ides the&s;e there are three regiments of Hamp&s;hire militia, engaged for no par|ticular term, and who go off whenever they plea&s;e, 150 are gone &s;ince la&s;t return; two regiments of Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts militia of 252 rank and file fit for duty, engaged for two months from their arrival, three weeks of which with &s;ome of them is already expired. Among the number returned &s;ick there is no doubt but many would be u&s;eful in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, but at any rate we cannot reckon upon more than 2200 men. I am very much concerned to give you this di&s;agreeable detail, but I have &s;omething wor&s;e to add to it.&mdash;We cannot increa&s;e our numbers by calling in the militia without ruin; for by the Commi&s;&s;ary's return and the account of his weekly expenditure, there is meat for &s;even weeks only on the ground, and he has no pro&s;pect of any &s;upply of &s;alt meat, but from &s;ome place near Still-Water, nor of fre&s;h, but by &s;ending to New-England for it.&mdash;This I have de&s;ired him to do, but mu&s;t own I have little pro&s;pect of advantage from it; for be a&s;&s;ured that, and indeed every other communication, may and will very ea&s;ily be cut off.&mdash;I have heard of &s;ome cattle below Crown-Point, which I &s;hall &s;end for to-morrow.</P>
<P>The bridge goes on tolerably well, but is indeed a very heavy trouble&s;ome job.&mdash;The ca&s;&s;oons, Col. Baldwin &s;ays, will be all &s;unk by the end of next week; in the mean time I have ordered the floating bridge to be removed to the lower &s;ide of them, which will &s;erve as a kind of &s;econd boom, and retard at lea&s;t, if not prevent, the enemy's ve&s;&s;els from pa&s;&s;ing, &s;hould they attempt it.</P>
<P>A magazine of wood &s;hould be laid in immediately, but how to effect it I know not, as there are no teams here of any kind, and not a &s;tick upon the Mount.&mdash;All the timber for the bridge is hauled out of the woods by hand, and employs a much greater number of men than would otherwi&s;e be nece&s;&s;ary, and might be employed, and are wanted for other purpo&s;es.&mdash;What can the Quarter-Ma&s;ter mean by leaving this place, where &s;o many works are to be carried on, without &s;o nece&s;&s;ary an article as draught cattle?</P>
<P>The tents here are in general very bad. I mu&s;t beg you, my dear General, to ha&s;ten up the new tents, for I &s;hall get no good of the troops here in any way, whil&s;t they remain in barracks.</P>
<P>Our powder magazines are in &s;o wretched a &s;tate, that I am told near fifty pounds of powder a week is damaged. In &s;hort, every thing is &s;o much out of order, that I will add no more to this lift of griev|ances, than to tell you we have no cartridge paper.</P>
<P>When I write again, I hope to have &s;omething more agreeable to entertain you with, and am,</P>

<SALUTE>Dear General,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>INCLOSED you have the returns of the troops and &s;tores at this place, all except the cloathier's, which is &s;o drained I thought it needle&s;s to a&s;k for any from him, as he has almo&s;t literally nothing.</P>
<P>Since my la&s;t I have had con&s;tant &s;couts out, but have made no di&s;covery of the enemy, &s;ave that four of their ve&s;&s;els are lying about a mile on the hither &s;ide of the Split Rock; they con&s;i&s;t of two &s;hips, and two gondolas; and on Friday la&s;t a &s;chooner beat up within four miles of Crown-Point, but, without landing any of her people, or coming to anchor, returned down the lake.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday about noon we had two men, who had &s;trolled out of camp without arms, taken by a party of &s;avages, who had &s;tole down to the road &s;ide betwixt M'lnto&s;h's and the bridge, and concealed them&s;elves in the bu&s;hes; they were immediately pur&s;ued as far as Putnam's Creek, but could not be over-taken; un|luckily, however, they fell in with a &s;couting party I had &s;ent down to di&s;cover the motions of the enemy, that were upon their return, and fired upon them unexpectedly; the officer is wounded, one man killed and &s;calped, and one mi&s;&s;ing, but whether taken or not is as yet uncertain.</P>
<P>Another party that I had ordered to proceed to Point-au-Fer, or wherever the enemy might be, returned la&s;t night on di&s;covering a large party of Indians on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the lake about four miles above Crown-Point. I think of &s;ending to feel their pul&s;e to-night, as I am &s;ure it would be of con&s;equences to give tho&s;e fellows a drubbing.</P>
<P>I am at a lo&s;s to form a judgment of the de&s;igns of the enemy. If they mean to attack us, one would think it indi&s;creet to put us on our guard by &s;uch a trifling affair, and yet I cannot think they could prevail with any number of the &s;avages to come on, unle&s;s they had an army not far off to &s;upport them. Be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> as it will, I &s;hall u&s;e every precaution po&s;&s;ible again&s;t &s;urprize and will endeavour to penetrate their de&s;igns. The &s;ame rea&s;on, notwith&s;tanding our weakne&s;s, &s;till prevails again&s;t calling for the militia as when I wrote la&s;t, having as yet received no &s;upply of meat either fre&s;h or &s;alt.</P>
<P>Do you know, Sir, any thing about the terms upon which Capt. Whitcomb's corps was rai&s;ed. He informs me, that by General Gates's orders he promi&s;ed his people that they &s;hould have the &s;ame bounty as the troops of the &s;tate in which they were rai&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding they were not part of their quota. This pro|mi&s;e has not been complied with, and they are held by a conditional agreement only, which expires this day. I &s;hall be able to retain them, however, until you favour me with your an&s;wer.</P>
<P>I am making &s;ome improvement upon the Mount, but that and the Ticonderoga &s;ide have &s;uch dependence upon, and connection with, each other, that in my opinion it will be very dangerous to give up either, and yet it is certain we cannot with our pre&s;ent numbers hold both. I de&s;ign, however, to make the appearance of doing it, and after defending Ticonderoga as long as po&s;&s;ible retreat to Mount Independence.</P>
<P>Our guards are crouded with tories; they are dangerous here, and cannot properly be tried. I have order|ed them to Albany.</P>

<P>SERJEANT HEATH, who I &s;ent down the Lake to make di&s;coveries, returned la&s;t night, and informs me, that on Tue&s;day la&s;t he &s;aw two birch canoes going down the Lake with &s;ixteen Indians and three white men in them, and &s;uppo&s;es it was the party that had done the mi&s;chief near the lines the day before&mdash;that, from a place near the mouth of Otter Creek, he &s;aw three ve&s;&s;els under &s;ail beating up, one at anchor about one mile above Split Rock, and the Thunderer behind it&mdash;from this place he likewi&s;e de|&s;cried an encampment of the enemy on both &s;ides of Gilliland's Creek&mdash;that from the appearance of it, and the extent, he thinks it mu&s;t contain a great body of men, and that a number of &s;moaks aro&s;e at a di&s;tance back, which he &s;uppo&s;ed was from the encampment of the Indians,&mdash;that on Friday la&s;t, from Pointon, he &s;aw twenty batteaus come out of Gilliland's Creek, and &s;ail up the Lake pa&s;t the Split Rock towards Ticonderoga&mdash;that one of the inhabitants in whom he could place confidence informed him the Indians were very numerous&mdash;that they frequently cro&s;s to the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Lake, and that a party of them had been at his hou&s;e a few minutes before his arrival&mdash;that he then returned to Otter-Creek, where he propo&s;ed to have halted to refre&s;h his party, but on being informed that a large party of Indians were at one Bri|ton's, he made the be&s;t of his way here&mdash;one of his party this day fell behind a little, and was either taken or de&s;erted; he &s;u&s;pects the latter, becau&s;e he both waited for him, and &s;ent back to look for him&mdash;that one Webb, another inhabitant, informed him that the enemy had been four or five days at Gilliland's&mdash; that they came up with a va&s;t number of batteaux and &s;ome gondolas&mdash;that &s;ome of the troops come over frequently, and &s;ay their whole army is there, and that they are only waiting the arrival of the re&s;t of their ve&s;&s;els and &s;tores, when they are to attack this place.</P>
<P>I have no doubt that a party of the enemy are at Gilliland's, nor that their de&s;ign is to come here, but not in my opinion to attack, but to harra&s;s us, and give confidence to their &s;avages, who, it is more than probable, would not have been prevailed upon to undertake it without being joined by &s;ome regular troops. Were they in force, it is improbable they would wa&s;te their time at &s;uch a di&s;tance, in a part of the country where they can find nothing to refre&s;h them&s;elves; and I do not find that they have made any depredations on the ea&s;t &s;ide.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to judge of the force at a di&s;tant view of an encampment, and Heath mu&s;t have been &s;ix miles or more di&s;tant from that on Gilliland's Point, a di&s;tance too great to determine any thing with pre|ci&s;ion, although he had a gla&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t his eye; be&s;ides, I think the ground is not capable of encamping a great number (for he in&s;i&s;ts on it they are not upon the high ground, but upon the beach only) but of this you are a much better judge than me, as I never &s;aw it but once: Be the matter as it will, I &s;hall endeavour to guard again&s;t &s;urprize, and to di&s;cover both them and their de&s;igns; and, if opportunity offers, feel their pul&s;es a little.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="016141_0007_0F9C7A4DA6A007F0">I had all the ground between this and Crown-Point, from the Lake &s;ome di&s;tance over the mountains, well examined ye&s;terday with a heavy &s;cout, but they di&s;covered no enemy, nor appearance of any: Whitcomb &s;ays he is certain there has not been an Indian but three in that quarter &s;ince the pri&s;oners were taken, and that it was three or four days &s;ince the&s;e three had been there; &s;o that the Indians &s;aid to have been about us, and fired at, were, I believe, the children of a di&s;turbed imagination.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I INCLOSE you a return of the troops at this po&s;t, by which you will &s;ee that our effective numbers are very little more than two thou&s;and, a force greatly inadequate to its defence, which, &s;hould the enemy attack it in force, would require at lea&s;t four times that number. In that two thou&s;and are included a num|ber of artificers, who are unarmed, and many of the &s;oldiers are in the &s;ame condition, and the whole in very great want of cloathing, accoutrements and bayonets.</P>
<P>The intelligence I have received of the enemy's approaching, I have from time to time tran&s;mitted to General Schuyler, of which I make no doubt he has appri&s;ed Congre&s;s. It is now pa&s;t a doubt that they are moving towards us, but whether in force or not I have not yet been able to di&s;cover. Seven of their ve&s;&s;els came up to Crown-Point la&s;t night, and others of their fleet are about three or four miles lower down, as we judge from their morning guns. They have al&s;o landed &s;ome troops, who are encamped upon Chimney-Point, which lies on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Lake, directly oppo&s;ite to Crown-Point. If the militia were called in, they might po&s;&s;ibly enable us to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, but I have not yet ventured upon that &s;tep, on account of the low &s;tate of our provi&s;ions, there not being more than thirty-five days meat tor the troops now here, and the un|certainty in which we were with regard to the enemy's de&s;igns.</P>
<P>No army was ever in a more critical &s;ituation than we now are; and, &s;uppo&s;ing that this motion is only a feint to favour the operations of General Howe, which I &s;till &s;u&s;pect it to be, we may, and probably will, be reduced to the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, the &s;upplies being derived from &s;uch a di&s;tance, and the communication &s;o difficult, that it is next to impo&s;&s;ible to &s;upport it. The exten&s;ivene&s;s of our works adds greatly to our em|barra&s;&s;ment, and will demand &s;o great con&s;tant guards, as mu&s;t in a very &s;hort time wear down our troops, and do the enemy's bu&s;ine&s;s for them; and &s;hould we give up one &s;ide of the Lake, and confine our&s;elves to the defence of the other, they would infallibly cut off our communication, and reduce us by famine.</P>
<P>My duty to my country, and to my&s;elf, obliges me to make the&s;e repre&s;entations; neverthele&s;s, I &s;hall leave nothing undone within my power to fru&s;trate the attempts of the enemy, nor leave any means untried to penetrate their real de&s;igns. If I am happy enough to make any material di&s;covery, I &s;hall take the earlie&s;t opportunity to give information to Congre&s;s; and although I may at la&s;t be obliged to evacuate this place, I hope to make them pay dear enough for it, to repent of their bargain.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear General,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS morning &s;ome of the enemy's gun boats appeared at the Three Mile Point, when the alarm was given. We could &s;ee them di&s;embark a number of men, and the boats increa&s;ed to eighteen, which are now lying a brea&s;t from the hither &s;ide of the point to about half way acro&s;s the lake. The batteaus in which they tran&s;ported their troops are not come in &s;ight, lying on the far &s;ide of the point, under cover of it.</P>
<P>Soon after their landing a party, chiefly Indians and Canadians, pu&s;hed towards our lines. As we had a &s;cout down the lake at the time of their arrival, I immediately &s;ent out two parties to &s;upport and bring them off. The &s;cout fell in with the enemy, and after a few &s;hot, in which they &s;ay &s;ome of the Indians were killed, they, being overpowered by numbers, di&s;per&s;ed, and part of them are got in, and I have little doubt but the greate&s;t part of them will yet make their appearance. It is probable, however, that &s;ome of them have fallen into their hands. We have had one or two alarms before this, but it was occa&s;ioned by their boats coming up near our guard boats, and their firing upon them.</P>
<P>My people are in the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ition po&s;&s;ible, and I have no doubt about giving a good account of the enemy, &s;hould they think proper to attack us; and if the per&s;on I mentioned to you in my la&s;t pur&s;ues the opportunity that now pre&s;ents it&s;elf, they will go back fa&s;ter than they came on. He has above a thou&s;and men.</P>

<P>GENERAL SCHUYLER reque&s;ted the Council to take into con&s;ideration the &s;tate of this po&s;t, with re&s;pect to the number of troops nece&s;&s;ary for its defence, the di&s;po&s;ition of the troops, and mode of de|fence, the &s;tate of the fortifications, and the quantity of provi&s;ions that may be depended upon.</P>
<P>The Council, having taken into their mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration the &s;everal matters &s;tated in the fir&s;t article, are clearly and unanimou&s;ly of opinion,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> That the number of troops now at this po&s;t and Mount Independence, which are under 2500 effec|tives, rank and file, are greatly inadequate to the defence of both po&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="016141_0008_0F9C7A4E650DC760"><HI>Second.</HI> That both po&s;ts ought, neverthele&s;s, to be maintained as long as po&s;&s;ible, con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;afety of the troops and &s;tores.</P>
<P><HI>Third.</HI> That if it &s;hall become nece&s;&s;ary to evacuate one or other of the po&s;ts, and that it remains in our election which, that it ought to be the Ticonderoga &s;ide.</P>
<P><HI>Fourth.</HI> That &s;uch cannon and &s;tores as are not immediately nece&s;&s;ary on the Ticonderoga &s;ide be removed, without delay, to Mount Independence.</P>
<P><HI>Fifth.</HI> That the fortifications and lines on Mount Independence are very deficient; and that the repairing the old, and adding new works ought to claim immediate attention; and that the engineers be directed to repair and make the nece&s;&s;ary fortifications.</P>
<P><HI>Sixth.</HI> That the ob&s;tructions in the Lake to prevent the enemy's naval force from getting into our rear, and thereby cutting off all &s;upplies, or preventing a retreat, if &s;uch a mea&s;ure &s;hould unhappily become in|di&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, ought to be compleated with all imaginable di&s;patch.</P>
<P><HI>Seventh.</HI>That &s;o much remains to be done effectually to compleat the ob&s;truction, that with the few troops we have, there is no great probability that it can be done in le&s;s than &s;ix weeks.</P>
<P><HI>Eighth.</HI> That although our force may be adequate to maintain our ground on Mount Independence, yet, unle&s;s a &s;ufficient &s;tock of provi&s;ion can be thrown in before the arrival of the enemy, we having now only thirty-nine days provi&s;ion of meat kind, we think it would be imprudent to expo&s;e the army to be made pri&s;oners by the enemy; and that, therefore, it is prudent to provide for a retreat, to effectuate which, that all the batteaus now at this po&s;t be immediately repaired, and as many as can be &s;pared out of the Lake George be brought hither.</P>
<P><HI>Ninth.</HI> That a quantity of provi&s;ion of the meat kind &s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible, be immediately forwarded from Albany or el&s;e-where.</P>

<P>GENERAL ST. CLAIR repre&s;ented to the Council, that as there is every rea&s;on to believe that the batteries of the enemy are ready to open upon the Ticonderoga &s;ide, and that the camp is very much expo&s;ed to their fire, and to be enfiladed on all quarters; and as there is al&s;o rea&s;on to expect an attack upon Ticon|deroga and Mount Independence at the &s;ame time, in which ca&s;e neither could draw any &s;upport from the other; he de&s;ired their opinion, whether it would be mo&s;t proper to remove the tents to the low ground, where they would be le&s;s expo&s;ed, and wait the attack at the Ticonderoga lines, or whether the whole of the troops &s;hould be drawn over to Mount Independence, the more effectually to provide for the defence of that po&s;t. At the &s;ame time the General begged leave to inform them, that the whole of our force con&s;i&s;ted of 2089 effectives, rank and file, including 124 artificers unarmed, be&s;ides the corps of artillery, and about 900 militia who have joined us, and cannot &s;tay but a few days.</P>
<P>The Council were unanimou&s;ly of opinion, that it is impo&s;&s;ible with our force to defend Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, and that the troops, cannon and &s;tores, &s;hould be removed this night, if po&s;&s;ible, to Mount Independence.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="016141_0011_0F9C7A4CE6FD3380"><HI>Second.</HI> Whether, after the divi&s;ion of the army at Ticonderoga have retreated to Mount Independence, we &s;hall be in a &s;ituation to defend that po&s;t; or, in ca&s;e it cannot be defended, if a retreat into the country will be practicable.</P>
<P>The Council are unanimou&s;ly of opinion, that, as the enemy have already nearly &s;urrounded us, and there remains nothing more to inve&s;t us compleatly but their occupying the neck of land betwixt the Lake and the Ea&s;t Creek, which is not more than three quarters of a mile over, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves of the Narrows betwixt and Skeen&s;borough, and thereby cutting off all communication with the country, a retreat ought to be undertaken as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and that we &s;hall be very fortunate to effect it.</P>

<P>Mr. Avery, Deputy Commi&s;&s;ary General in the Northern Department, being &s;worn,</P>
<P>Q. What Quantity of provi&s;ion was at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence the 13th of June, 1777?</P>
<P>A. I cannot particularly a&s;certain the quantity of provi&s;ion, as I had no particular return at that time, but to the be&s;t of my recollection General St. Clair wrote me the 15th or 16th of June, that there was &s;even weeks provi&s;ion on hand at Ticonderoga, Mount Independence and its dependencies.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. What was the general purport of my letter to you?</P>
<P>A. The general purport was informing me that there was &s;uch a quantity of provi&s;ion there. That you thought it too &s;mall a quantity; and if I did not forward on more, you would leave me to judge what the con&s;equence would be to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Did you receive a letter from General Schuyler about the &s;ame time, and upon the &s;ame &s;ubject?</P>
<P>A. Yes.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you recollect the purport?</P>
<P>A. Much the &s;ame as your's was; complaining of the quantity of provi&s;ion at that po&s;t being too &s;mall, and urging an immediate &s;upply.</P>
<P>Mr. Yancey, who &s;uperintended the I&s;&s;uing Commi&s;&s;ary's Department at Ticonderoga and Mount Inde|pendence, being &s;worn,</P>
<P>Q. Were any &s;upplies of provi&s;ion received at Ticonderoga or Mount Independence between the 20th of June and 6th of July, 1777?</P>
<P>A. I left Ticonderoga the 21&s;t of June in order to purcha&s;e cattle. I purcha&s;ed my&s;elf twenty-one cattle, and &s;ent forward to Ticonderoga twenty of them. The other I &s;ent forward, with thirty oxen and &s;teers delivered me by Mr. Avery's order, all to Ticonderoga. There were a few cattle al&s;o &s;ent on in company with the&s;e for the ho&s;pital. I do not know their number. The fir&s;t was &s;ent on the 26th of June; the place from where they were &s;ent was called Paulett. The next was the 27th of June, place called Manche&s;ter.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know whether the&s;e cattle arrived at Ticonderoga or Mount Independence?</P>
<P>A. Not from my own knowledge. I under&s;tood that one, two or three of the cattle were made u&s;e of by Colonel Warner, who took them under his care to drive them into Ticonderoga, and I under&s;tood that they arrived there, but only from information.</P>
<P>Q. Court. What quantity of provi&s;ion was i&s;&s;ued the 20th of June as a ration?</P>
<P>A. I do not, at pre&s;ent, exactly know what quantity was i&s;&s;ued as a ration at that time. The artificers received one ration and a half.</P>
<P>Q. Court. What quantity of provi&s;ion was daily i&s;&s;ued by the General's orders, and to the general ho&s;pital?</P>
<P>A. I do not know. The general ho&s;pital was &s;ometimes &s;upplied by my magazine, but not &s;teadily. The general officers and their families, and &s;everal of the field and &s;ome other officers, drew what they plea&s;ed on account.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Where could the general ho&s;pital have been &s;upplied with provi&s;ion, unle&s;s it was from your magazine?</P>
<P>A. I do not know from any place with re&s;pect to fre&s;h provi&s;ion, unle&s;s they &s;ent out and purcha&s;ed it. The &s;alt provi&s;ion and flour could be got from me only.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Was there any country in the neighbourhood from which they could have been &s;upplied?</P>
<P>A. None nearer than the Hamp&s;hire Grants.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. When you made the return of the 20th of June, did you count the barrels of provi&s;ion your&s;elf, or did you make up your return from the returns made to you?</P>
<P>A. I did not count the barrels of provi&s;ion. I made the return from the entries of my peoples receipts and deliveries.</P>
<P>Q. Court. When did the book of accounts commence from which you made your return?</P>
<P>A. I believe the fir&s;t of December&punc; 1776.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Had there not been, from time to time, a con&s;iderable quantity of provi&s;ion condemned at this po&s;t?</P>
<P>A. I &s;ent &s;ome packers to Ticonderoga in March, 1777, to repack the provi&s;ion. They returned to me I think in April, and I &s;aw when I got up to Ticonderoga an account of damaged provi&s;ion among&s;t my papers, amounting to about twenty-eight barrels of beef or pork, but I am pretty confident the twenty-eight barrels of beef or pork were not included in the general return of the 20th of June, but I cannot undertake to &s;ay there was no damaged provi&s;ion among&s;t the quantity mentioned in the return of the 20th of June.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Did you know, when you were &s;ent to purchase fre&s;h provi&s;ion, of any magazine of &s;alt provi&s;ion in the vicinity of Ticonderoga, from which you could have &s;upplied that garri&s;on?</P>
<P>A. I knew of &s;alt provi&s;ion having been carried forward from Bennington and William's-Town to St. Coack, but I do not know the quantity.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion to Mr. Avery. Did you order &s;alt provi&s;ion from St. Coack or Stillwater to Albany?</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="016141_0012_0F9C7A50A42382B8">A. I ordered a &s;mall quantity from Stillwater, the magazine at Albany being empty of &s;alt provi&s;ion at the time. It was &s;ome time in the month of June, as near as I can recollect.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion to Mr. Avery. How long did the magazine at Albany remain empty, and did any &s;upply of provi&s;ion arrive between that time and the 6th of July?</P>
<P>A. There was &s;ome provi&s;ion arrived at Albany, but what quantity I cannot tell, but not much more than was &s;ufficient for the &s;upply of the troops that were there.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion to Mr. Avery. Did you write to General Schuyler, that you were deceived by your Purcha&s;ing Commi&s;&s;aries?</P>
<P>A. I do not remember that I did; but I do not know but I might have wrote to General Schuyler that they had not collected the quantity that I expected.</P>
<P>The Court adjourned till to-morrow, nine o'clock.</P>

<P>Mr. Leavenworth, being &s;worn, &s;ays: I arrived at Ticonderoga the 9th of March, and tarried there until the retreat. About three weeks before the retreat, as near as I can remember, it was reported that the enemy were at Split Rock, and I heard guns &s;ome days that were &s;aid to be their evening and morning guns. I al&s;o heard General St. Clair give out he thought that the enemy were between &s;ix and &s;even thou&s;and &s;trong. On the 26th of June I made report to General St. Clair of the tallow in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the quantity being great. He &s;aid he would give directions about it, and &s;aid al&s;o that the Commi&s;&s;ary ought to have taken care of it, and had it worked up. General St. Clair took occa&s;ion to mention that the Commi&s;&s;ary had not only ne|glected his duty in that in&s;tance, but al&s;o had neglected it in not &s;ending on the &s;upplies of provi&s;ion. I did not hear any thing more about it, and on Wedne&s;day before the retreat I went to General St. Clair re|&s;pecting it, who &s;aid it was the Commi&s;&s;ary's bu&s;ine&s;s, and he ought to have taken care of it, and blamed him again on account of provi&s;ion, and &s;aid there were but a few days provi&s;ion. I told him I thought there was more. All the provi&s;ion had been removed from Ticonderoga to Mount Independence, and on Thur&s;day or Friday I went to Mount Independence to &s;atisfy my&s;elf re&s;pecting the quantity of provi&s;ion there, and I think there were full three thou&s;and barrels of beef, pork and flour there, from the appearance of them. I did not count them. This was a larger quantity than appeared to be there on the twenty-&s;ixth of June. On Wedne&s;day before the retreat I was at Head-Quarters, and ob&s;erved it was entirely &s;tripped of the baggage, and in con&s;equence of it I put my baggage in a boat, and &s;ent it to Mount Independence. Having received no orders about the tallow, I de&s;ired &s;ome gentlemen to &s;peak to the General about it, and on Saturday morning the enemy made their appearance on Mount Defiance, when, talking to &s;ome gentlemen re&s;pecting the tallow, one of them &s;aid I had done enough to exculpate my&s;elf re&s;pecting it, and gave me to under&s;tand that we were to retreat that evening, and told me not to let it be known by words or actions, and told me not to regulate my conduct by it &s;o that it might be known. It was General Poor who told me of it. On Saturday evening, at gun firing, I went into my boat with my people, and went to the &s;outh-we&s;t point of Mount Independence, and I continued in my boat and on the point of Mount Independence all night. Be|tween eleven and twelve o'clock at night, one Serjeant Bond came down, who told me that he came down to &s;ee what boats were there. That between twelve and one o'clock, a party of men came down to the Scotch|man's, and took the boats up to the Crane, as they &s;aid, to load with provi&s;ion, and at day light began to re|turn, and I went off with my boat in company with the fir&s;t boats. The cannon began to be removed (when General Schuyler was pre&s;ent) from Ticonderoga to Mount Independence, and continued to be removed after General Schuyler's departure, as were quantities of artillery &s;tores.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="016141_0013_0F9C7A516462CDD8">Q. Did any quantity of provi&s;ion arrive at Ticonderoga or Mount Independence from the 20th of June to the time of the evacuation, either from Fort George or Skeen&s;borough!</P>
<P>A. Not to my knowledge.</P>
<P>Q. Did any number of cattle arrive at Ticonderoga or Mount Independence between the 20th of June and the time of the evacuation?</P>
<P>A. I &s;aw cattle that Colonel Warner &s;aid he brought in with him. I thought I &s;aw (from the idea I now have) about forty head.</P>
<P>Q. Were any parties &s;ent out to annoy the enemy, by order from General St. Clair, in their advance again&s;t, and inve&s;titure of, the po&s;ts under his ca<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">e, to your knowledge?</P>
<P>A. The enemy came to Three Mile Point, and I have &s;een parties go out of about twenty men in a party. I know of none &s;ent out to oppo&s;e the enemy's progre&s;s.</P>
<P>Q. Court. What kind of ground was it between Three Mile-Point and Ticonderoga?</P>
<P>A. I have not been over the whole of the ground, but over part of it; there are &s;ome cleared fields next to the Lake, and woods back. This is all the de&s;cription I can give of the ground.</P>
<P>Q. Were the troops under General St. Clair healthy, courageous, and de&s;irous of improving every advan|tage again&s;t the enemy?</P>
<P>A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Court. What rea&s;on had you to think the troops were healthy, courageous, and de&s;irous of improving every advantage again&s;t the enemy?</P>
<P>A. In the fir&s;t place, with regard to their being healthy, I had occa&s;ion to be at the ho&s;pital &s;everal times after the enemy came near to us, and I did not &s;ee many &s;ick there, and it was generally reported that the army was healthy. After I was apprehen&s;ive that we were to retreat, I took pains to enquire of a number of officers of my acquaintance, indirectly, whether the troops were courageous, and determined to fight, &s;hould the enemy come on, and they all an&s;wered in the affirmative.</P>
<P>Q. Court. Was it your opinion, and the opinion of the officers you indirectly a&s;ked whether the troops were courageous and determined to fight, that the place was defen&s;ible?</P>
<P>A. I did not a&s;k any of the officers whether the place was defen&s;ible. It was my own opinion that the place was not defen&s;ible in the circum&s;tances it then was.</P>
<P>Q. Court. What do you mean by the circum&s;tances it was then in?</P>
<P>A. In the fir&s;t place, the lines were very exten&s;ive, &s;o that there were not men enough on the ground to man them: Another circum&s;tance was, the enemy had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heights about us: Another was, the heavy cannon, artillery &s;tores, and all the provi&s;ion, were removed from Ticonderoga to Mount Inde|pendence; and the rea&s;on why Mount Independence could not be defended was, that there were not works thrown up &s;uitable to cover the men. Great part of the provi&s;ion that was carried over to the Mount was, at the time of the retreat, at the foot of the Crane. The di&s;tance from the place the provi&s;ion lay, to the top of the Mount, was about two hundred feet.</P>
<P>Q. Was any thing done at Mount Independence between the 20th of June and the 6th of July, 1777, to|wards repairing the old works there, and adding new works?</P>
<P>A. I was not at the &s;outh end of Mount Independence, but I heard there were &s;ome &s;mall works flung up there. The north end of Mount Independence appeared to me as u&s;ual on the Thur&s;day or Friday preceding the evacuation. I &s;aw no new fortifications on it, nor any additional works. I know there were no new for|tifications where I expected there would have been &s;ome built.</P>
<P>Q. Did General St. Clair &s;end his &s;on and baggage to Fort George, as a place of &s;afety, before his evacu|ation of the po&s;ts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence?</P>
<P>A. I don't know that he did of my own knowledge.</P>
<P>Q. Were the &s;ick, the public &s;tores of ammunition, cannon, provi&s;ion and cloathing left behind, when the po&s;ts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were evacuated?</P>
<P>A. Some of the &s;ick were carried off, which I &s;aw. I know nothing re&s;pecting the other particulars.</P>
<P>Q. What time was it you heard General St. Clair give out that the enemy were between 6 and 7000 &s;trong?</P>
<P>A. It was &s;aid by General St. Clair while the enemy lay at Split Rock. I believe about a fortnight before the evacuation.</P>
<P>Q. Court. Would the provi&s;ion be (lying at the foot of the Crane) under the enemy's fire, after Ticon|deroga &s;hould be in their hands?</P>
<P>A. They were within cannon &s;hot of Ticonderoga, and the enemy mu&s;t have commanded the Lake.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Were there not parties con&s;tantly at work, getting up the provi&s;ion from the bottom to the top of the Mount?</P>
<P>A. There was a party at work when I went to &s;ee what provi&s;ion was there, and I &s;uppo&s;e there was a party con&s;tantly at work. It was reported &s;o.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. At what time of the day was it on Saturday that General Poor gave you the information of the evacuation being likely to take place?</P>
<P>A. It was in the morning before breakfa&s;t. I don't know the time of the day. I took it General Poor was going to Head-Quarters.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. What quantity of tallow had you in your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>A. One hundred and fifty-four barrels. If I remember right, there were 34&punc; 345 lbs.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Had you ever made any report of the tallow to me before the 26th of June?</P>
<P>A. No.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. You have mentioned &s;everal times that I gave out that the enemy were between 6 and 7000 &s;trong. I &s;hould be glad to know whether it was to you I told it, or how you came to be acquainted with it?</P>
<P>A. I don't recollect the circum&s;tances but at one time; that was on the day it was &s;aid the &s;cout returned from Split Rock. I was at Head-Quarters, and I heard you ob&s;erve to &s;everal officers who were there, that the enemy were between 6 and 7000 &s;trong.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you recollect the company who were there?</P>
<P>A. I can't recollect any per&s;on particular, but I think General Patter&s;on was there.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="016141_0014_0F9C7A522430E098">General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Did you ever hear me &s;ay that the enemy were lying at Split Rock, to the amount of any number of troops?</P>
<P>A. You did not &s;ay that the enemy lay at Split Rock, but that they con&s;i&s;ted of about the number before|mentioned.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you know of any <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> between any of the parties from Ticonderoga and the enemy?</P>
<P>A. I heard of &s;ome people being killed and &s;calped between the brea&s;t-work and Ticonderoga landing, and I think there was a &s;calp brought in by &s;ome of Whitcomb's people.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you know of any larger parties than twenty men being &s;ent out?</P>
<P>A. I don't recollect any.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. You have mentioned Head-Quarters being &s;tripped of baggage. I &s;hould be glad to know what kind of baggage you ob&s;erved had been removed from thence?</P>
<P>A. I don't recollect particular things.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. What kind of baggage&punc; had you ever ob&s;erved there?</P>
<P>A. I had ob&s;erved uten&s;ils, &s;uch as drinking gla&s;&s;es, one chair, a table and a vallefe; but all the uten&s;ils I &s;aw in the room at this time was one bowl, except a table and &s;tools.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Did you ever &s;ee any thing removed from Head-Quarters?</P>
<P>A. I cannot &s;ay ab&s;olutely that I did.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you know whether there were parties employed in forming an abbitis about Mount Independence, at any time between the 20th of June and the evacuation?</P>
<P>A. I do not.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Did you ever &s;ee parties of axe-men &s;ent over there?</P>
<P>A. I &s;aw parties of axe-men go off the parade often, but I did not know where they went, nor did I a&s;k them to my knowledge.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you know whether the parties of axe-men you &s;aw go off the parade were employed on the Ticonderoga &s;ide?</P>
<P>A. I do not.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion to Mr. Yancey. Did you ever report to me that there was an ounce of tallow at Ticonderoga, or did it appear in any return of your's?</P>
<P>A. I don't believe that I ever told you any thing about it, or made any return to you of it.</P>
<P>The Court adjourn to the hou&s;e of Capt. Rathburn, in King-Street, until Friday next, at nine o'clock.</P>

<HEAD>AUGUST <HI>28</HI>th.</HEAD>
<P>The Court met at Captain Rathburn's, in King's-&s;treet, according to adjournment.</P>
<P>Major General St. Clair admits that he wrote a letter to the Hon. John Jay, dated July 25th, 1777, in which there was a &s;entiment, in &s;ub&s;tance, that if the General Officers had been again&s;t the evacuation of the po&s;ts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, it would have taken place, as he knew it would be impo&s;&s;ible to defend the po&s;ts with his numbers.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Colonel Hale being &s;worn,</P>
<P>Q. Were you at Ticonderoga or Mount Independence when the evacuation of tho&s;e po&s;ts took place?</P>
<P>A. I was on Mount Independence.</P>
<P>Q. Did you command a regiment?</P>
<P>A. I was Lieutenant Colonel of Colonel Leonard's regiment of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts militia.</P>
<P>Q. Was the time of &s;ervice of this regiment nearly expired when the evacuation of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence took place?</P>
<P>A. It was nearly expired, as they viewed it, and I think within two or three days from the time of the evacuation.</P>
<P>Q. What do you mean by the terms, as they viewed it?</P>
<P>A. I mean the men viewed their time of &s;ervice to have commenced from the time they were rai&s;ed, and the time they drew pay from. They, I under&s;tood, founded this belief from the order of the Brigadier, which was that they were rai&s;ed for two months &s;ervice; which, when I &s;hewed General St. Clair, he &s;aid it was dif|ferent from the order of the Court. The order of the Court was, that they &s;hould &s;erve two months from the time of their being on the ground, to the be&s;t of my remembrance.</P>
<P>Q. Did you inform General St. Clair that the men viewed their time of &s;ervice to be nearly expired, and when it took place were determined to go home?</P>
<P>A. After I had heard &s;omething &s;aid among the people that they viewed their time of &s;ervice as nearly out, and it was talked among them if they &s;taid they &s;hould get no pay, I &s;poke to them that the enemy were near, and that was the only time, if they came to do any thing, that it was to be done. I al&s;o &s;poke to &s;ome of the officers, with regard to the time of &s;ervice being nearly out, and told them I would inform the General of the circum&s;tances. After this, on Saturday preceding the evacuation, I waited on General St. Clair, to let him know what the regiment thought re&s;pecting the&s;e matters, and invited Lieut. Colonel May, the Colonel of the other Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts regiment, to go with me. We went, and I informed General St. Clair of the circum&s;tances I have related, and told him their unea&s;ine&s;s with re&s;pect to drawing their money on the ground; who told me, that if they made up their rolls their money was ready for them. Lieutenant Colonel May and my&s;elf &s;hewed the General the Brigadier's order, and the General &s;aid it was different from the order of the Court. The men al&s;o made an excu&s;e that they had not been invited to &s;tay. When we informed General St. Clair of the circum&s;tances, he &s;aid the men mu&s;t not go away by any means if they were di&s;po&s;ed to go, and told me to write a certificate of the matter, and &s;aid perhaps I &s;hall give them a &s;mall bounty, and &s;aid your certificate will ju&s;tify me for &s;o doing. The General &s;aid he would let the matter re&s;t till morning and think on it, and would &s;end word to me in the morning what propo&s;als to make to the regiment. I went and told the officers of it that night, who appeared to be well &s;atisfied. It was near night when we parted from the General.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="016141_0015_0F9C7A52E4B1FB60">General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you not recollect your mentioning to me, or Lieutenant Colonel May, that the men con&s;idered their time nearly out, and were determined to go home when it was out, and &s;ugge&s;ted to me that probably a &s;mall bounty might induce them to &s;tay?</P>
<P>A. I do not recollect it.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. What do you conceive the men under&s;tood by their &s;aying that they were not invited to &s;tay?</P>
<P>A. Upon &s;ome of the men &s;aying that their times were nearly out, I told them they mu&s;t &s;tay longer if there was an occa&s;ion for it. They &s;aid they had not been invited to &s;tay, and &s;uppo&s;ed, if they &s;taid, they &s;hould get no pay for it. I con&s;idered it only as an excu&s;e of theirs, that they &s;hould not get pay if they &s;taid after their time was out.</P>
<P>Q. Court. Had you ever before the Saturday informed General St. Clair of the mens opinion of the &s;hort time they had to &s;tay?</P>
<P>A. I had not.</P>
<P>Q. Court. What was your inducement for going to the General that day?</P>
<P>A. Upon hearing what I have before related among&s;t the men, that they con&s;idered their time of &s;ervice as nearly out, and that &s;ome of them talked of going home, and to remove all unea&s;ine&s;s about it.</P>
<P>Q. Court. What Rea&s;ons have you to &s;uppo&s;e the men would have &s;taid, had General St. Clair given them an invitation?</P>
<P>A. The conver&s;ation I had with them induced me to think &s;o.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Were you at Ca&s;tle-Town the day after the evacuation?</P>
<P>A. I was.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Did not both your's and Colonel May's regiment determine to leave the army that day?</P>
<P>A. Not that I know of.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Were you pre&s;ent when I had the two militia regiments drawn up, and &s;poke to them on that &s;ubject?</P>
<P>A. No; but I knew that you were &s;peaking to one of the regiments. I was at a di&s;tance, and &s;aw a parade of men, and you among&s;t them. The regiments were intermixed, and &s;ome of my men likely were there.</P>
<P>Q. Court. Did you know at the time what General St. Clair &s;aid to them?</P>
<P>A. I was unwell at a di&s;tance at the time, and did not know, but I under&s;tood afterwards, but don't know from whom, that he was &s;aying &s;omething to them about keeping with the army.</P>
<P>Q. Court. When did the regiments leave the army?</P>
<P>A. I believe it was the fourth day at Manche&s;ter.</P>
<P>Q. Court. Did the regiments go off by order?</P>
<P>A. We were marching rather in di&s;order, when General St. Clair a&s;ked me whether I commanded that regiment? I told him I did, part of them; and he &s;aid, By God, I wi&s;h you would embody them, and march them home.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Did I not, in the cour&s;e of the march, frequently complain of the di&s;order of the two regiments, and reprove them for it?</P>
<P>A. Not in my hearing?</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Were they not di&s;orderly on the march?</P>
<P>A. They did not keep rank and file.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you remember of Colonel May's having reported to me that the men were willing to &s;tay, but the officers were not?</P>
<P>A. I do not.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Did your regiment keep their &s;tation that was a&s;&s;igned them in the line of march?</P>
<P>A. I know of no &s;tation that was a&s;&s;igned them but one day: Whether they kept it that day or not I don't remember.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Did not your regiment break the line of march, and were you not halted by General Poor ju&s;t after leaving the picketted fort, who &s;aid he would turn out a party of men, and order them to fire upon them?</P>
<P>A. I do not remember it.</P>
<P>Q. Was the regiment Colonel May belonged to in the &s;ame &s;ituation with re&s;pect to the opinion of the men, that their time of &s;ervice was nearly expired, as your's was?</P>
<P>A. Much the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Q. When Colonel May went with you to General St. Clair, did he inform him that his men viewed their time of &s;ervice nearly expired, and were determined to go as &s;oon as it was expired?</P>
<P>A. We related what I have before mentioned.</P>

<P>Major General Gates being &s;worn, &s;ays, Some time in April, in the year 1777, I made a requi&s;ition from Congre&s;s for the defence of the Northern Department, and e&s;timated the troops nece&s;&s;ary for that &s;ervice as follows: Two Major Generals; &s;ix Brigadiers; one battalion of artillery, 600; twenty-five battalions of infantry, 12,500; two companies of rangers, 100; &s;taff, batteau-men, &amp;c. 400; total 13,600. At that time I did not expect General Burgoyne would have landed between 10 and 11,000 men. If I had, I &s;hould have required more men for the defence of that department.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. During the time I had the honour of &s;erving under you, did you ever di&s;cover in me cowardice, treachery, or incapacity as a general officer?</P>
<P>A. From my long acquaintance with you as an officer, and particularly your u&s;efulne&s;s to me as a Brigadier General in the campaign of 1776, it excites my a&s;toni&s;hment that there &s;hould be &s;uch charges as cowardice, treachery, or incapacity, exhibited again&s;t you. From any knowledge of you, both as an officer and a gentleman, I have the highe&s;t opinion of your courage, honour, capacity and fidelity.</P>
<P>Q. What proportion of the&s;e troops ought to be at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence?</P>
<P>A. At Fort Schuyler, 500. The intermediate po&s;ts between Albany and Fort Schuyler inclu&s;ive, 500. The po&s;ts between Albany and Fort George inclu&s;ive, 600. At Fort Ann and Skeen&s;borough, 300. The remainder at Ticonderoga and its dependencies. Be&s;ides the&s;e, I expected aid from the Militia of the country, having unlimited powers from Congre&s;s for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Q. Court. What number of men would you have thought nece&s;&s;ary, had you been fully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the force of General Burgoyne?</P>
<P>A. Three to two.</P>
<P>Dr. Brown being &s;worn,</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Were the &s;ick removed from the ho&s;pital at the time of the evacuation?</P>
<P>A. All except four, whom it was un&s;afe to remove, as there was a chance of their recovery by remaining, and if they were removed, it was my opinion they would not have &s;urvived to have reached Skeen&s;borough.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Was any part of the medicines and ho&s;pital &s;tores removed?</P>
<P>A. A day or two days before the communication was cut off with Fort George, all were removed, except what was wanted for an immediate &s;upply, which were all &s;aved.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Was any part of what was left at Ticonderoga &s;ent off?</P>
<P>A. There was; but I cannot &s;ay what proportion was &s;aved. There was an officer and fifty men given us, and boats &s;ufficient, and had they done their duty, it is my opinion we could have &s;aved all the medicines and &s;tores.</P>
<P>Q. Court. How long before the evacuation took place were the &s;ick &s;ent off?</P>
<P>A. There were a number of &s;ick &s;ent off &s;ome days before the evacuation took place; about the time the enemy appeared at Three Mile Point: The re&s;t, except the four, were removed at the time of the evacuation.</P>
<P>Q. Court. Do you know whether there was a magazine of flour appropriated for the u&s;e of the ho&s;pital, &s;eparate from the general magazine?</P>
<P>A. I believe there was none.</P>
<P>Q. Did any provi&s;ion arrive for the ho&s;pital, particularly, &s;ome days before the evacuation?</P>
<P>A. There were &s;ome &s;heep, beeves and milch cows. I do not recollect the number.</P>
<P>Q. In what &s;ituation was the army at the time of the evacuation, with re&s;pect to health?</P>
<P>A. There were very few in the ho&s;pital, not above 100; a great proportion of them wounded. There were a number in the regiments not fit for duty, on account of the mea&s;les, and the con&s;equences of that di&s;order, which had prevailed much; but not proper objects for the general ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>Dr. Town&s;hend being &s;worn,</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Were the &s;ick removed from the ho&s;pital at the time of the evacuation?</P>
<P>A. All that could be removed with any degree of &s;afety to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Was any part of the medicines and ho&s;pital &s;tores removed?</P>
<P>A. A day or two before, to the be&s;t of my remembrance, the communication with Fort George was clo&s;ed, there was a large proportion carried over to the &s;tore there, and only what was judged &s;ufficient was left for tho&s;e that remained on the ground.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Was any part of what was left at Ticonderoga &s;ent off?</P>
<P>A. Yes. Early in the evening, about dark, preceding the evacuation, we had a number of men &s;ent to carry the &s;tores down to the landing on the &s;outh &s;ide of Mount Independence. They worked very indu&s;triou&s;ly the fir&s;t of the evening, and packed nearly the whole, and the chief of them was carried to the landing, my&s;elf a&s;&s;i&s;ting; but the men, when they found the place was to be evacuated, de&s;erted us. We got the greater part into the boats, and went off to Skeen&s;borough in the morning.</P>
<P>Q. Court. How long before the evacuation took place were the &s;ick &s;ent off?</P>
<P>A. About the time the medicines were &s;ent off to Fort George. The &s;ick, that were not likely to recover in a few days, that could be &s;ent off without injuring them by tran&s;portation, were &s;ent to the ho&s;pital at Fort George.</P>
<P>Q. Court. Do you know whether there was a magazine of flour appropriated for the u&s;e of the ho&s;pital, &s;eparate from the general magazine?</P>
<P>A. There was not.</P>
<P>Q. In what &s;ituation was the army at the time of the evacuation, with re&s;pect to health?</P>
<P>A. The army was healthy, except with re&s;pect to the mea&s;les, which had prevailed very generally through the camp. They had recovered of the mea&s;les at the time of the evacuation, but they had left many of them languid with coughs.</P>
<P>Q. What &s;ituation was the army in a few days previous to the evacuation, with re&s;pect to health?</P>
<P>A. Much in the &s;ame &s;ituation as they were at the time of the evacuation, except a number more had the mea&s;les then than had at the time of the evacuation. I examined a number of regiments a little before the evacuation particularly, and there were in general between thirty and forty unfit for duty, but not fit objects for the general ho&s;pital.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="016141_0017_0F9C7A54A3482678">
Que&s;tion to Dr. Brown. What &s;ituation was the army in a few days previous to the evacuation, with re&s;pect to health?</P>
<P>A. I believe they were not quite &s;o healthy as at the time of the evacuation, and not &s;o many fit for duty, as they were recovering daily from the mea&s;les and its effects. I examined the regiments my&s;elf a few days before the evacuation, and the pre&s;criptions of the &s;urgeons, and found but very few but had from twenty to thirty unfit for duty. Some had more.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion to Dr. Brown. Were not the ho&s;pital &s;urgeons frequently required to in&s;pect into the &s;tate of the &s;ick in each regiment, and was it not done with a view that I might not be impo&s;ed on by the regimental returns?</P>
<P>A. They were de&s;ired to do it frequently, and I have &s;ome idea of &s;ome conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ing between Dr. Potts and my&s;elf about the intention of doing it, but I do not recollect the particulars of it.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion to Dr. Town&s;hend. The &s;ame as the la&s;t to Dr. Brown.</P>
<P>A. We were directed to do it frequently, and there was &s;carcely a day pa&s;&s;ed but &s;ome of the regiments were examined by &s;ome of the &s;urgeons of the general ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>Colonel Hay, who acted as Deputy Quarter-Ma&s;ter General for the army at Ticonderoga and Mount Inde|pendence, being &s;worn, &s;ays: On Saturday, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the day preceding the evacuation, I was &s;ent for by General St. Clair, who informed me that a Council of General Officers had been held, and they had determined to evacuate the garri&s;on next morning. I then took the liberty of a&s;king the General if he had received orders from General Schuyler? He told me he had not. To which I took the liberty of &s;aying I was extremely &s;orry for it. The General &s;aid he knew very well what I meant, and he had &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered the con&s;equences of the &s;tep he was taking. If he remained there, he would &s;ave his character and lo&s;e the army; if he went off, he would &s;ave the army and lo&s;e his character; the la&s;t of which he was determined to &s;acrifice to the cau&s;e in which he was engaged. The General then de&s;ired me to prepare every thing for the removal of as many of the &s;tores as po&s;&s;ible. I then told the General, that as the wind blowed hard from the north-ea&s;t, and the batteaus were lying at the &s;outh end of Mount Independence, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to get them round to remove the greate&s;t part of the &s;tores. The General &s;aid it mu&s;t at all events be attempted; for if the enemy knew of our de&s;ign to evacuate the place, they would certainly cut off our retreat; but, on further con&s;ideration, &s;aid he would take the opinion of the General Officers, and let me know the re&s;ult. In the mean time, that I was to prepare every thing po&s;&s;ible for carrying off the &s;tores, which I did as far as the wind, which ro&s;e much higher, would permit. I &s;aw the General afterwards at &s;un&s;et, who told me that Generals Poor and Patter&s;on were of opinion the evacuation ought not to be retarded. What few boats were near Ticonderoga &s;ide were then given to the artillery men, and the mo&s;t valuable &s;tores on that &s;ide carried down to the wharff on that &s;ide. About nine the General &s;ent for me again, and having a&s;ked what I had done, de&s;ired me to go as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible to Mount Independence, order as many boats as could be brought from the &s;outh &s;ide of the Mount to bring off the provi&s;ions that were lying near the Crane, leaving a proper proportion for the medicines, ammunition, and other mo&s;t valuable &s;tores, which were to be carried down to the &s;outh &s;ide. About, I think, one o'clock, I &s;aw the General again on Mount Independence, who begged that we would make all the di&s;patch po&s;&s;ible, and carry off all that we could in boats by day light. I then went down to where the provi&s;ion laid, and got a very con&s;iderable number of boats loaded, which at break of day were taken round to the &s;outh end of the Mount by the General's order. When I got there I found the &s;oldiers in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, and could not by threats or promi&s;es prevail on them to unload from the waggon, and embark on board the boats the mo&s;t valuable part of the General's baggage. Nearly about &s;un-ri&s;e the General him&s;elf came up, and begged, if po&s;&s;ible, I would &s;ave his papers, and pay no attention to the re&s;t of his baggage I &s;poke to Colonel Long, who, I under&s;tood afterwards had received orders from the General, was to command by water, and went off him&s;elf after the army that had marched &s;ome &s;hort time before. Some days before the evacua|tion, being at Head Quarters after dinner, there were three field officers there (I think Colonels, but am not certain) who had lately arrived with a &s;trong reinforcement of militia. Being a&s;ked by the General what time they could po&s;&s;ibly &s;tay? they replied, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to detain them but a very few days, as they had not a &s;econd &s;hirt to their backs, having fir&s;t turned out with no other view than driving a party of the enemy from Otter-Creek. I went off by water.</P>
<P>General St. Clair produces a return made to him by Colonel Hay, which Colonel Hay acknowledges was made by him to General St. Clair, and which Colonel Hay thinks mu&s;t have been made by him about the 21&s;t of June, 1777; which, being read, is as follows:</P>

<P>UDREY HAY, D. Q. M. G.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you know whether the men, returned by you as con&s;tant fatigue-men, were not included in the daily details for fatigue?</P>
<P>A. I am certain they were not included in the daily details for fatigue, being appropriated entirely to my department, and under my direction.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know whether the greater part of the provi&s;ion and &s;tores were got off from the garri&s;on?</P>
<P>A. The greater part of the provi&s;ion, I am certain, was not. I cannot an&s;wer with re&s;pect to the &s;tores, as when we arrived at Skeen&s;borough I had no time to examine them.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know the number of the body of the militia that arrived &s;ome days before the evacuation?</P>
<P>A. I do not know the number.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you know of more than one body of militia arriving?</P>
<P>A. Not that I remember.</P>
<P>Q. Court. Was there a &s;ufficient number of boats at the po&s;t to carry off all the provi&s;ion?</P>
<P>A. There was not a &s;ufficient number to have carried off the provi&s;ion and the other &s;tores.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know how many ox-teams were employed at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence at the time of the evacuation.</P>
<P>A. I cannot tell, having lo&s;t all my returns; but the number was not large, as in that wilderne&s;s there was not gra&s;s to maintain them.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. In what condition were the ox-teams that were employed at the&s;e po&s;ts?</P>
<P>A. The oxen were in poor working order, but might probably have brought the provi&s;ion from the landing, had they no other garri&s;on duty to do.</P>
<P>Q. Court. Do you know of any parties having been &s;ent out by General St. Clair to di&s;cover the enemy's numbers, or to annoy them in their progre&s;s again&s;t the garri&s;on?</P>
<P>A. To di&s;cover their numbers, I know of parties having been frequently &s;ent out, and the General com|plained they were in &s;uch dread of the &s;avages, he could not get proper intelligence from them. I know of none &s;ent out to annoy the enemy in their progre&s;s, but the regular pickets that were &s;ent out.</P>
<P>Q. How large were the&s;e parties that were &s;ent out to di&s;cover the enemy's numbers?</P>
<P>A. I cannot an&s;wer with any exactne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="016141_0019_0F9C7A55E60CB130">Q. Court. Do you know whether the troops were courageous, and had a de&s;ire to improve every advantage again&s;t the enemy?</P>
<P>A. Their own words, and the facts which aro&s;e when they were &s;ent out, were &s;o very different, that it was difficult to judge, as they were generally beat back again.</P>
<P>The Court adjourn till to-morrow, nine o'clock.</P>
<P>The Court adjourn, by his Excellency's de&s;ire, until Thur&s;day next, at nine o'clock.</P>
<P>The Court adjourn, by his Excellency's de&s;ire, until Monday, nine o'clock, to meet in camp.</P>

<HEAD>SEPTEMBER <HI>7</HI>th.</HEAD>
<P>The Court met in Camp according to adjournment.</P>
<P>Colonel Ko&s;eiu&s;zko being &s;worn,</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you recollect what the &s;trength of the fatigue parties was, that were employed on Mount Independence on or about the 23d day of June, 1777?</P>
<P>A. About five or &s;ix hundred men were employed on the batteries at Mount Independence as fatigue men, after General Schuyler had been at Ticonderoga, and had given directions to put new works on Mount Inde|pendence. There was al&s;o a party employed in front of the works, in a thick wood, cutting abbatis; I do not recollect the number. I remember that General Fermoy's brigade was employed in the wood cutting abbatis. General Fermoy him&s;elf was there two or three days. Be&s;ides the&s;e, I always &s;ent a fatigue party to cut the abbatis.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you know whether there was a fatigue party likewi&s;e employed at the time on the Ticonderoga &s;ide?</P>
<P>A. I know there was a fatigue party employed on the brea&s;t-work.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Did you not, by my orders, make &s;ome additions to the works on the Ticonderoga &s;ide?</P>
<P>A. Yes; between the we&s;t end of the French lines and the Lake. It was not quite fini&s;hed at the time of the evacuation.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Suppo&s;ing Ticonderoga to have been abandoned, and the enemy to have been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, would it have been po&s;&s;ible to have maintained the works on the point of Mount Independence, that were made for the command of the Lake and the defence of the bridge?</P>
<P>A. No; as the ground overlooked them about fifty feet.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you recollect where the place from which we got our water was, on Mount Independence &s;ide, and the &s;ituation of it?</P>
<P>A. On the we&s;t &s;ide of Mount Independence, on the low ground, near the Lake.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Could we ea&s;ily get at the water?</P>
<P>A. No; It was very &s;teep, and I think about one half a mile di&s;tant from the fort.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Suppo&s;ing the enemy had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome of their ve&s;&s;els into South-Bay, would it not have been wholly in their power to have cut us off from the water?</P>
<P>A. The &s;pring would have been expo&s;ed to the fire of the enemy.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you recollect the di&s;tance from the Lake to Ea&s;t-Creek, beyond the &s;outh end of Mount Independence?</P>
<P>A. About one half a mile or three quarters.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's Que&s;tion. Would it not have been in the enemy's power to have annoyed, from the ve&s;&s;els from South-Bay, any troops that might have been marching acro&s;s the I&s;thmus to the relief of Mount Independence?</P>
<P>A. It would have been in the enemy's power to have done it on account of the pa&s;&s;age being narrow, a thick wood, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Lake.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you recollect whether any works were begun to improve the redoubt on the high ground, on the point of Mount Independence?</P>
<P>A. Yes; by your order I marked out the lines, and prepared the fa&s;cines; which was after General Schuyler left Ticonderoga.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. In what condition was the fort upon Mount Independence?</P>
<P>A. It was a picketted fort, only for &s;mall arms. Picketted all round, &s;ome good and &s;ome bad.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. How many men could the fort contain with convenience for the defence of it?</P>
<P>A. About 1000 men.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. What batteries had the enemy erected again&s;t Ticonderoga at the time, or before the evacuation took place?</P>
<P>A. One battery was erected again&s;t the Jer&s;ey redoubt on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the Lake, about half a mile di&s;tant, and on higher ground. They had made &s;ome works where they had an encampment again&s;t the French lines, about half a mile or three quarters di&s;tant. The enemy had al&s;o taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mount Hope, a retrenched camp, which had been occupied by us the campaign before, by which the communication with Lake George was cut off. They had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mill, burnt the block-hou&s;e, and pa&s;&s;ed on the other &s;ide of the creek, where they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a hill which commanded all Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, and had begun a firing on the &s;loop that was &s;tationed for the defence of the pa&s;&s;age from Lake George. They had al&s;o begun &s;ome works on a point on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Lake, oppo&s;ite to the bridge.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you recollect Colonel May's having told me, after I had &s;poke to the militia at Ca&s;tle-Town, that the men would &s;tay, but the officers would not?</P>
<P>A. I do not recollect Colonel May's having told you of it, but I met &s;ome of the militia on the retreat, and having expre&s;&s;ed my &s;urprize at their not &s;taying to fight for their country, they an&s;wered, they were willing to &s;tay, but their officers would not.</P>
<P>Q. Court. Could the enemy's ve&s;&s;els lie in South-Bay, in a &s;ituation to command the &s;pring, and not be expo&s;ed to our batteries on Mount Independence?</P>
<P>A. There was high ground, and batteries could have been placed there to prevent them.</P>
<P>Q. Court. Could the enemy's &s;hips lie in South-Bay, in a &s;ituation mo&s;t to annoy a reinforcement going to Mount Independence, without being expo&s;ed to the fire of our batteries from Mount Independence?</P>
<P>A. They could.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="016141_0020_0F9C7A56A65C7710">Q. Court. Was there any other &s;pring on Mount Independence, out of the enemy's fire, that the garri&s;on could have been &s;upplied with water from?</P>
<P>A. No other la&s;ting one.</P>
<P>Q. Court. What kind of ground was it on the height on Mount Independence. Whether &s;tony, diffi|cult of rai&s;ing a parapet on. or of &s;inking a ditch?</P>
<P>A. Very &s;tony and rocky ground, and would require a great deal of labour to put on the works. A ditch could not be &s;unk to any proper depth without blowing the rocks.</P>
<P>Brigadier General Wilkin&s;on being &s;worn,</P>
<P>General St. Clair's Que&s;tion. Do you recollect what means were taken by me to gain intelligence of the approach of the enemy, and their numbers?</P>
<P>A. By &s;couts and detachments, both by land and by water.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's Que&s;tion. Were not there &s;couts and detachments &s;ent out frequently?</P>
<P>A. There was an e&s;tabli&s;hed daily &s;cout, as well as I recollect, be&s;ides many that were &s;ent out occa&s;ionally.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's Que&s;tion. Do you recollect the di&s;tance from Ticonderoga to Gilliland's Creek?</P>
<P>A. I cannot a&s;certain the di&s;tance.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's Que&s;tion. Do you recollect the nature of the ground between Ticonderoga and Gil|liland's Creek?</P>
<P>A. I can judge of it only from ob&s;ervation as I pa&s;&s;ed up and down the Lake. On the we&s;t &s;ide it is a mountainous craggy country, the mountains in many places jutting in full upon the Lake. On the ea&s;t &s;ide a flat low country covered with wood.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's Que&s;tion. Could large detachments of troops, had our garri&s;on been in a &s;ituation to have afforded them, march through that country on the we&s;t &s;ide of the Lake?</P>
<P>A. Not without great difficulty and probable lo&s;s, on either &s;ide of the Lake.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's Que&s;tion. Was there not, notwith&s;tanding the difficulty of the country, frequently &s;mall parties &s;ent out towards Gilliland's Creek, to di&s;cover the approach and &s;trength of the enemy, and were there not parties &s;ent out on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Lake with the &s;ame view?</P>
<P>A. There were.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's Que&s;tion. If large detachments had been &s;ent out at &s;uch a di&s;tance that they could not have been &s;upported with the whole force of the garri&s;on, could they have retarded the progre&s;s of the enemy, or mu&s;t they not have fallen into their hands?</P>
<P>A. They might have given a momentary check, but mu&s;t inevitably have been out off.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's Que&s;tion. Do you recollect my &s;ending out &s;erjeant Heath, with a party, previous to any account we had of the embarkation of the enemy on the Lake, with orders to proceed to Point au-Fer, or whenever he &s;hould find the enemy, endeavour to make a pri&s;oner, and bring me an account of them?</P>
<P>A. I do not recollect the officer's name, but I recollect a &s;cout was &s;ent out for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's Que&s;tion. Do you recollect the account he brought?</P>
<P>A. I recollect, that he informed that he di&s;covered the enemy &s;omewhere about Gilliland's Creek, en|camped, and that he conceived them to be in force.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's Que&s;tion. Do you recollect in what part of the country he was when he made the di&s;covery?</P>
<P>A. I think he was on the ea&s;t &s;hore, oppo&s;ite to Gilliland's Creek. I do not recollect the di&s;tance.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Did you hear of any other debarkation of the enemy than at Gilliland's Creek, from the time of their embarkation at Point-au-Fer to their landing at or near the Three Mile Point?</P>
<P>A. We were informed of their approach to Crown Point, and of their being encamped there. I don't recollect any other particular debarkation until their arrival at or near Three Mile Point.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Had we not information of numerous parties of the &s;avages being in the country, on the we&s;t &s;ide of the Lake?</P>
<P>A. We had, and found them &s;o very numerous that our parties could &s;carce ever get in view of the enemy, though many attempts were made to di&s;cover their &s;ituation.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Were there actions &s;everal times between our parties and the &s;avages?</P>
<P>A. There were, and I remember our parties on tho&s;e occa&s;ions were routed.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you recollect the &s;trength of the fatigue parties that were detailed on or after the 20th of June?</P>
<P>A. I cannot particularly a&s;certain the number. I remember that the fatigue parties and guards generally amounted to about one fourth of the number of effectives fit for duty in the garri&s;on, and &s;ome times one third.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Be&s;ides the number of men for fatigue that was detailed, was there not a con&s;tant fatigue party with the Quarter Ma&s;ter General, and a regiment of militia al&s;o employed in con&s;tant fatigue?</P>
<P>A. The Quarter-Ma&s;ter General had a con&s;tant fatigue party, be&s;ides the number that was furni&s;hed him by the details. There were be&s;ides, 100 men employed on daily duty from two regiments of militia.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you recollect my having ordered the fatigue on Mount Independence to be done by a brigade at a time, under the command of a Brigadier; and was not this number al&s;o exclu&s;ive of the detail for fatigue?</P>
<P>A. I recollect there was, and they were exclu&s;ive of the detail for fatigue, except the proportion from the brigade ordered on duty.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you recollect the dimini&s;hing the camp guards, and was it not done on account of the &s;everity of duty, by having &s;o many men on fatigue?</P>
<P>A. I recollect it, and it was done upon that principle.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. As you lived with me, you mu&s;t be acquainted with the baggage I had. I wi&s;h you would mention it.</P>
<P>A. You had a portmanteau, and a che&s;t which contained your baggage; al&s;o &s;ome kitchen furniture.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Was any part of my baggage &s;ent off from Ticonderoga previous to the evacuation?</P>
<P>A. No.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="016141_0021_0F9C7A5764CC5D48">General St. Clair's que&s;tion. What age was my &s;on, who left Ticonderoga?</P>
<P>A. He was a mere child; about ten or twelve years of age.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Was any part of my baggage &s;ent off with him when he was &s;ent to Fort George?</P>
<P>A. No part of it.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Could any of my baggage have been removed without your being acquainted with it?</P>
<P>A. I don't think it po&s;&s;ibly could.</P>
<P>Q. Court. Was any part of the furniture belonging to Head-Quarters removed to any other place previous to the evacuation?</P>
<P>A. None.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you recollect what orders were given to the troops on the evacuation being determined upon?</P>
<P>A. I do not, as I was then employed in fixing an occa&s;ional picket, but I believe the orders were given to the Brigadiers.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Was there a &s;trong picket advanced of the French lines, and the other pickets reinforced, &s;o as to form a chain of centinels the night of the evacuation?</P>
<P>A. I don't know it of my own knowledge, as I was ordered to Mount Independence to give orders about loading the battea<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">; but, from every information I received, I am induced to think there was.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Was not the order for the march of the troops, the &s;triking their tents, and loading their baggage, delivered by you to &s;ome of the regiments on Mount Independence?</P>
<P>A. The order for &s;triking their tents and loading their baggage was delivered by me, and di&s;per&s;ed to all the regiments about twelve o'clock at night.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. How was the retreat conducted?</P>
<P>A. The troops pu&s;hed out of Mount Independence without order or regularity, in a great deal of confu&s;ion. I remember that, after you had got them &s;tretched, you rode from the rear to the front, in order to halt and throw them into &s;ome form, but your orders were directly di&s;obeyed, and the militia would not halt, but pu&s;hed on, and drew after them many of the continental troops. When we arrived at Hubbarton, the army halted, and was refre&s;hed as well as our circum&s;tances would admit. After waiting a length of time, two or three hours, for the rear guard and &s;tragglers, you moved on with the main body, leaving the command with Colonel Warner, with orders to follow as &s;oon as the whole came up.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Were not many of the continental regiments got into good order &s;oon after they left Mount Independence, and did not the rear guard come off in very good order?</P>
<P>A. There were &s;everal regiments got into tolerable good order by your halting them, and other attempts, and the rear guard under Colonel Francis came off in very good order.</P>
<P>Q. How large was the daily &s;cout that was &s;ent out to gain intelligence of the enemy's approach and &s;trength?</P>
<P>A. From fifteen to twenty-five. It was a &s;ubaltern's light command.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know the &s;trength of tho&s;e that were &s;ent out occa&s;ionally for that purpo&s;e?</P>
<P>A. Their numbers varied. I remember one which amounted to 100.</P>
<P>Q. Do you recollect the time this &s;cout, con&s;i&s;ting of 100, was &s;ent out?</P>
<P>A. I do not recollect the day, but the occa&s;ion was the enemy had made a couple of pri&s;oners, and fell in with a returning &s;cout of ours which they routed; in con&s;equence of which this party was detached to come up with them if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Q. Do you recollect where the enemy lay at the time?</P>
<P>A. I cannot recollect particularly, but believe at Gilliland's Creek.</P>
<P>Q. After the enemy had landed at Three Mile Point, were any parties &s;ent out to annoy them in their approach towards the garri&s;on?</P>
<P>A. There were.</P>
<P>Q. How large were the&s;e parties?</P>
<P>A. There were two &s;mall parties &s;ent out. I believe they might have been about 60 men. They were routed and pur&s;ued by the Indians.</P>
<P>Q. Were any orders given for the de&s;truction of the barracks at the time of the evacuation of the garri&s;ons of Mount Independence and Ticonderoga, or before?</P>
<P>A. Not to my knowledge. The rea&s;on General St. Clair a&s;&s;igned for not &s;etting them on fire was, it would have betrayed our movement to the enemy.</P>
<P>Q. Court. Do you &s;uppo&s;e it would have had that operation?</P>
<P>A. It mo&s;t certainly would.</P>
<P>Q. Was the number of men returned on command in your return of the 28th of June, on command in the garri&s;on, or where?</P>
<P>A. There were many of them on command in the garri&s;on. I do not recollect the number. Some were on command at Fort Schuyler; &s;ome at Albany, and on the communication to Ticonderoga; at Skeen&s;borough, Fort-Ann, Lake-George landing, and at the block-hou&s;e at the &s;aw-mill.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. During my command at Ticonderoga, or at the time of the evacuation, did you perceive any in&s;tances of cowardice in me?</P>
<P>A. No; but I have upon every occa&s;ion ob&s;erved a direct contrary conduct.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Were you with me at Princeton and Trenton, and did you ob&s;erve any in&s;tance of cowardice in me there?</P>
<P>A. I was. I ob&s;erved no in&s;tance of cowardice in you, but, on the contrary, upon every occa&s;ion of danger, you manife&s;ted the utmo&s;t coolne&s;s and intrepidity.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. At the affair of Princeton do you recollect your riding up to me, and inform|ing me that our troops had given way in the centre; and do you recollect what pa&s;&s;ed between me and you upon that occa&s;ion?</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="016141_0022_0F9C7A5B256C75A8">A. I recollect your begging me to take no notice of it, left it &s;hould communicate a pannic to the troops we were with.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. At the time the picket was attacked at Ticonderoga, which occa&s;ioned &s;ome firing from the lines, and at every other time when there was firing, did I not transport my&s;elf to the place with the utmo&s;t expedition?</P>
<P>A. You did; and your po&s;itive injunctions to the officers and exhortations to the &s;oldiery were, to re&s;erve their fire until the enemy came within a very certain &s;hot.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Were there any other pickets placed by you be&s;ides tho&s;e mentioned in the orderly book?</P>
<P>A. There was an additional picket of 50 men po&s;ted on the left of the French lines, without them, every night, which came off in the morning; and a &s;imilar picket, &s;ubject to the &s;ame orders, was po&s;ted on the point to the right of the Jer&s;ey redoubt.</P>
<P>Q. Court. During the time you were with General St. Clair at Ticonderoga, did you ob&s;erve any conduct of his that induced you to think him treacherous to the United States?</P>
<P>A. No; but he did, upon every occa&s;ion, manife&s;t the mo&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;tic zeal for the good of the cau&s;e of the United States.</P>
<P>Q. Court. Do you know the particular period when General St. Clair had compleat information of the number and de&s;igns of the enemy?</P>
<P>A. The fir&s;t information of their number and de&s;ign which he received, that could be relied on was, I think, two days before the evacuation. This intelligence was by &s;tratagem obtained from a pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>The Court adjourn till ten o'clock to-morrow.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear General,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOT finding a convenient opportunity to &s;end off my letter, I have the plea&s;ure to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th. The &s;ucce&s;s of General Wa&s;hington over General Howe is an event of &s;uch importance, as mu&s;t de&s;troy every pro&s;pect of the enemy's carrying their plans into execution, &s;hould they &s;uccced here. I have ordered a feu-de-joye upon the occa&s;ion, and will find &s;ome way to communicate the intelligence to the enemy. We have now two &s;hips, eighteen gun boats, and three &s;loops, lying off the Three Mile Point, and they are forming a camp upon the point, and retrenching it. This does not look like their being &s;trong. Other matters I hope to manage to-morrow morning, but cannot be particular for fear of accidents.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear General,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YESTERDAY at noon, in the very in&s;tant of the feu-de-joye, which con&s;i&s;ted of thirteen pieces of cannon (the mu&s;ketry might have di&s;covered to the enemy our numbers) forty-one batteaus appeared of me Three Mile Point, cro&s;&s;ed the Lake, and landed troops on the ea&s;t &s;ide, in the Bay formed behind the Long Point, oppo&s;ite to the Three Mile Point. I ob&s;erved them very attentively, and am certain they did not contain on an average above twenty men. It is not improbable, however, that part of the troops tran&s;|ported in them from Canada may have landed on the we&s;tern &s;ide, &s;o low down as to be out of our &s;ight, and I am rather inclined to think this the ca&s;e, from their camp extending a con&s;iderable di&s;tance down the Lake, and its being much too large for the number of men we &s;aw debark at the Point.</P>
<P>I am in great pain for the batteaus and &s;tores at the Landing. We cannot po&s;&s;ibly get them over (the enemy having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of Mount Hope) without ri&s;king &s;uch large detachments as might oblige us to come to action in the open field, which would not be altogether prudent. I had ordered a party to bring them off this morning, but the e&s;cape of &s;ome of the cattle, and the &s;tupidity of the drivers, re|tarded us &s;o much that day appeared, and it was then too late to attempt it. The de&s;ign was therefore laid a&s;ide, and a party &s;ent to reinforce the party at the Landing, with orders to take back the &s;tores to Fort-George, and all the batteaus, de&s;troying the block-hou&s;e, and &s;uch batteaus as they might not be able to carry off. At the &s;ame time I &s;ent orders to the block-hou&s;e at the mills, which has been attacked &s;everal times, and was &s;urrounded ye&s;terday all day, for the officer to &s;et fire to it and the mills, and to retire to camp, which he has this moment effected. The party gone over with the boats I have de&s;ired to return by Skeen&s;borough. It will be of the utmo&s;t importance to &s;ecure that communication, which I have no doubt of your being able to do; and when the Grant people come in, I hope to keep open that by Ca&s;tle-Town. A party of them, with cattle, &s;hould have been here ye&s;terday. I hope no accident has happened them.</P>
<P>The inhabitants who live between this and the bridge, I found it nece&s;&s;ary to bring within the lines, and have now &s;ent them to Skeen&s;borough, with directions to Captain Gray to forward them to Albany by the fir&s;t opportunity. I do not know that they are our enemies, but they are certainly not our friends; and when the enemy fir&s;t pre&s;ented them&s;elves they were through their hou&s;es, and they gave us no intelligence of them</P>
<P>I am &s;till of opinion that the enemy have no great force here, but whether the whole of their army may as yet be come up I am not certain, but la&s;t night they tired their evening gun from three different places, farther down the Lake than their po&s;t at Three Mile Point. A little time will clear up this matter.</P>
<P>I am not &s;ufficiently acquainted with this country to form any judgment how a body of men can be &s;ent out to our relief, in ca&s;e the enemy po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the &s;hores of the Lake above Mount Inde|pendence,
<PB N="24" REF="016141_0023_0F9C7A6126094E00">
which they certainly will by means of their &s;avages; but if they can be brought by land in their rear, a &s;mall party would oblige them to quit the Lake, and con&s;equently leave the communication Open.</P>

<P>OUR picket was attacked ye&s;terday two or three times, in which we lo&s;t five men killed, and two or three wounded. The enemy's lo&s;s we are not apprized of, but we have one pri&s;oner of the 47th regiment, and two de&s;erters from the corps of Jagers. The pri&s;oner was very &s;ulky, and would give no information whatever; but by di&s;gui&s;ing an officer, a countryman of his, and confining him in the &s;ame room with him, with the help of a little rum, we got out all he knew, which have here inclo&s;ed, as al&s;o the examination of the de&s;erters. Two men came in from the Grants la&s;t night, and returned. I have wrote very pre&s;&s;ingly for the people to come on, and for the pre&s;ent leave the cattle to be brought up by tho&s;e who &s;ucceed them. I think it is probable Warner will fall in with the foreigners, who are all on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Lake. The Briti&s;h troops upon the we&s;t. Excu&s;e this &s;crawl.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>CONGRESS may probably think it extraordinary that &s;o much time &s;hould have elap&s;ed before they heard from me, after a &s;tep of &s;uch con&s;equence as the evacuation of the po&s;ts that had been entru&s;ted to my care, but it was not in my power to write whil&s;t on the march to this place. I am &s;orry to find that my letter to General Schuyler, the night the evacuation took place, has not come to his hands; as, for want of that, tho' he has doubtle&s;s informed Congre&s;s of the matter, he could not give them the rea&s;ons that induced it. They were the&s;e:</P>
<P>Seeing that the po&s;ts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were nearly inve&s;ted, and having intelli|gence by my &s;pies that they would be compleatly &s;o in twenty-four hours, when we &s;hould be cut off from all po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uccour; that the batteries of the enemy were ready to open, and the whole of our encampment, on the Ticonderoga &s;ide, expo&s;ed to their fire; con&s;idering, at the &s;ame time, the weakne&s;s of the garri&s;on, that the effective numbers were not &s;ufficient to man one half of the works, and that, con&s;equently, the whole mu&s;t be upon con&s;tant duty, which they could not po&s;&s;ibly long &s;u&s;tain, and that of cour&s;e the places, with the garri&s;on, mu&s;t inevitably in a very few days fall into the enemy's hands; I &s;aw no alternative but endea|vouring to evacuate them and bring off the army. Whereupon I called the General Officers together, to take their &s;entiments. They were unanimou&s;ly of opinion that the places &s;hould be evacuated without the lea&s;t lo&s;s of time; and it was accordingly &s;et about that night, the 5th in&s;tant, after embarking in boats as much of our cannon, provi&s;ion and &s;tores, as was po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>With the boats, which were ordered to Skeen&s;borough, I &s;ent Colonel Long, an active, diligent, good officer, to take the command there, with his regiment and the invalids, until I &s;hould join him with the army, which was to march to that place by Ca&s;tle-Town. The body of the army reached Ca&s;tle-Town the next evening, thirty miles from Ticonderoga, and twelve from Skeen&s;borough; but the rear guard, under the command of Colonel Warner, which, with the &s;tragglers and infirm, amounted to near 1200, &s;topped &s;hort of that place &s;ix miles, and were next morning attacked by a &s;trong detachment the enemy had &s;ent to hang upon our rear and retard our march. Two regiments of militia, who had left us the evening before, and halted about two miles from Colonel Warner, were immediately ordered to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but, to my great &s;urprize, they marched directly down to me. At the &s;ame time I received information that the enemy were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Skeen&s;borough, and had cut off all our boats and armed ve&s;&s;els. This obliged me to change my route, that I might not be put betwixt two fires, and at the &s;ame time be able to bring off Colonel War|ner, to whom I &s;ent orders, if he found the enemy too &s;trong, to retreat to Rutland, where he would find me to cover him, that place lying nearly at an equal di&s;tance from both. Before my orders reached him his party was di&s;per&s;ed, after having for a con&s;iderable time &s;u&s;tained a very warm engagement, in which the enemy &s;uffered &s;o much, that they pur&s;ued but a very &s;mall di&s;tance. Our lo&s;s I cannot a&s;certain, but believe it does not exceed 40 killed and wounded. About 200 of the party have joined me at Rutland and &s;ince, but great numbers of them are &s;till mi&s;&s;ing, and I &s;u&s;pect have got down into New-England by the way of No. Four. After a very fatiguing march of &s;even days, in which the army &s;uffered much from bad weather and want of provi&s;ion, I joined General Schuyler the 12th in&s;tant.</P>
<P>It was my original plan to retreat to this place, that I might be betwixt General Burgoyne and the inhabi|tants, and that the militia might have &s;omething in this quarter to collect to. It is now effected, and the mi|litia are coming in, &s;o that I have the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes that the progre&s;s of the enemy will be checked, and I may yet have the &s;atisfaction to experience, that, altho' I have lo&s;t a po&s;t, I have eventually &s;aved a State.</P>
<P>Perhaps I may be cen&s;ured, by tho&s;e who are unacquainted with the &s;ituation I was in, for not &s;ooner call|ing the militia to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I think I informed Congre&s;s that I could not do that for want of provi&s;ion; and as &s;oon as I got a &s;upply I did call for them, and was joined by near 900 the day before the evacuation, but they came from home &s;o ill provided, that they could not, nor did not, propo&s;e to &s;tay with me but a few days. The two Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts regiments of militia likewi&s;e, which compo&s;ed part of the garri&s;on, gave me notice that their time expired in two days, and they intended then to go home. In vain did I beg of their officers to exert every influence they had over them, and, from their &s;ub&s;equent behaviour, I am fully per|&s;uaded the officers are mo&s;t to blame. They kept with me, however, for two days on the march, but their conduct, was &s;o licentious aud di&s;orderly, and their example beginning to affect the continental troops, I was con&s;trained to &s;end them off.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed is a copy of the Council of War, in which you will find the principles upon which the retreat was undertaken. As I found all the General Officers &s;o fully of opinion that it &s;hould be done immediately,
<PB N="25" REF="016141_0024_0F9C7A61E6231B78">
I forbore to mention to them many circum&s;tances which might have influenced them, and which I &s;hould have laid before them, had they been of different &s;entiments. For I was, and &s;till am, &s;o firmly convinced of the nece&s;&s;ity, as well as the propriety of it, that I believe I &s;hould have ventured upon it, had they been every one again&s;t it.</P>
<P>I have the utmo&s;t confidence in the candour of Congre&s;s, and per&s;uade my&s;elf, notwith&s;tanding the lo&s;s they have &s;u&s;tained, when they have impartially con&s;idered that I was po&s;ted, with little more than 2000 men, in a place that required 10,000 to defend it&mdash;that the&s;e 2000 were ill equipped and wor&s;e armed, not above one bayonet in ten, an arm e&s;&s;ential in the defence of lines&mdash;that with the&s;e 2000 I have made good a retreat from under the no&s;e of an army at lea&s;t four times their numbers, and have them now betwixt the enemy and the country, ready to act again&s;t them&mdash;that my conduct will appear at lea&s;t not de|&s;erving cen&s;ure.</P>

<P>Lieutenant Colonel Varrick being &s;worn,</P>
<P>Q. Did you mu&s;ter the troops at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence in the month of June, 1777?</P>
<P>A. Yes; except Colonel Long's regiment, which was mu&s;tered before I arrived there.</P>
<P>Q. In what condition was the continental troops with re&s;pect to arms?</P>
<P>A. Some of them very indifferent. The three New-Hamp&s;hire regiments, Colonel Scammel's, Colonel Cilley's and Colonel Hale's, had pretty good French arms, and chiefly bayonets. I believe a majority of the other regiments had not bayonets. The militia regiments had arms, but very indifferent, but no bayonets.</P>
<P>Q. Had the corps of artillery or artificers any arms?</P>
<P>A. None.</P>
<P>Q. Were the lines and redoubts at Ticonderoga furni&s;hed with &s;pears?</P>
<P>A. They were furni&s;hed with &s;ome &s;pears and &s;harp pointed poles, but whether there were &s;ufficient or not for them I cannot tell.</P>
<P>Q. Did General St. Clair inform you on or about the 26th or 27th of June, 1777, of the quantity of provi&s;ion he had in the garri&s;on?</P>
<P>A. I think he mentioned to me he had about thirty-&s;ix days of the meat kind. Flour, I do not know what quantity he had.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Were there not a great many boys among&s;t the troops?</P>
<P>A. There was a number of boys, old men and negroes. I di&s;mi&s;&s;ed at the mu&s;ter 50, as po&s;itively unfit for any kind of &s;ervice, and would have di&s;mi&s;&s;ed more, had you not de&s;ired me to be very tender, as you had &s;o few troops in garri&s;on.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Did not my &s;on pa&s;s the Lake from Ticonderoga with you?</P>
<P>A. Yes; he pa&s;&s;ed the Lake at my reque&s;t. I urged the matter to you.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Did any part of my baggage go over when he went with you?</P>
<P>A. None. Some of your &s;on's clothes were left behind.</P>
<P>Major Hull being &s;worn,</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. How was the retreat in General from Mount Independence conducted?</P>
<P>A. The general plan of the retreat, I think, was very well, though there was &s;ome part of the troops that behaved di&s;orderly.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. During the time of my command at Ticonderoga, did you ever ob&s;erve any kind of cowardice, treachery, or inattention to the progre&s;s of the enemy in me?</P>
<P>A. Not the lea&s;t appearance of either.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you recollect the circum&s;tance of my ordering a &s;trong picket out the night of the evacuation under Colonel Francis, and that it was directed to be of picked men?</P>
<P>A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Court. What was the general plan of the retreat?</P>
<P>A. General Poor's brigade was ordered in front, the militia next, General Patter&s;on's brigade next, General Fermoy's brigade after him, and the rear guard, con&s;i&s;ting about 450 men, under the command of Colonel Francis. Over the fir&s;t part of the ground we marched in file, owing to the nature of the country; where the ground would admit of it we marched in platoons. General Poor's brigade, as far as I was capable of &s;eeing, when they fir&s;t marched off from Mount Independence, marched off in good order.</P>
<P>Q. Court. How were the invalids di&s;po&s;ed of at the time of the evacuation?</P>
<P>A. Tho&s;e who were not able to march were &s;ent by water. The others marched with their re&s;pective regiments.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. What quantity of provi&s;ion was ordered for the troops to take with them before they left the garri&s;on?</P>
<P>A. I think eight days; principally pork and flour, and &s;ome hard bread.</P>
<P>Brigadier General Poor being &s;worn,</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you know what means were taken to di&s;cover the approach and &s;trength of the enemy?</P>
<P>A. By continually &s;ending &s;couts by land on both &s;ides of the Lake, and by water.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Did you ever hear of any landing the enemy made but at Gilliland's Creek, until they came to Crown-Point?</P>
<P>A. No.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you recollect my &s;ending out &s;erjeant Heath, with a party, to make di&s;coveries?</P>
<P>A. No; but I recollect your &s;ending out Lieutenant Lifer, who returned with two pri&s;oners. I remember your &s;ending out a per&s;on with orders to proceed to Point-au-Fer, or wherever the enemy were, who brought intelligence that the enemy were on the well &s;ide of the Lake at Gilliland's Creek.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="016141_0025_0F9C7A5CA8BEB5B8">General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you recollect the general &s;trength of the parties that were &s;ent out?</P>
<P>A. Sometimes a Subaltern's command, &s;ometimes a Captain's command, Captain Whitcomb being out frequently; &s;ometimes by twos and threes, merely as &s;pies.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Would the &s;ending of larger parties have an&s;wered a better purpo&s;e than of &s;ending the parties that were &s;ent, and could larger parties have been &s;ent without great danger of lo&s;ing them?</P>
<P>A. For the &s;ake of gaining intelligence of the approach of the enemy, or to a&s;certain their numbers, could have been much better attained by &s;mall parties than by large ones, as any con&s;iderable number of men marching in that woody country, where the ground is covered with mo&s;s, might ea&s;ily be di&s;covered, and of con&s;equence would be expo&s;ed to have been cut off by the enemy.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you recollect whether the working parties were increa&s;ed on or after the 20th of June?</P>
<P>A. If I remember right, the detail was taken off, and we were ordered to work by brigades, to turn out in the brigade every officer and man who were off duty and able to work, to throw up lines on Mount Independence, and al&s;o to fell the trees on the &s;ides and at the bottom of the hill. Near twenty acres of trees were felled.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Was there any wood on Mount Independence, to have &s;upplied the garri&s;on in ca&s;e of a &s;iege, or was there a magazine of wood laid in?</P>
<P>A. There was no magazine of wood laid in. There was &s;ome &s;cattering logs upon the top of the hill, and &s;o much upon the &s;ides, that I believe we &s;hould not have been put to any difficulty in getting wood, in ca&s;e we had been be&s;ieged.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. How long do you &s;uppo&s;e the wood that was on the Mount would have fur|ni&s;hed firing for the garri&s;on we had?</P>
<P>A. At that &s;ea&s;on of the year it might have la&s;ted us a fortnight.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Could we have &s;pared men from the works that we were engaged in, to have laid in a further &s;upply of wood, or had we a number of draught cattle &s;ufficient to have brought it from any di&s;tance?</P>
<P>A. At that time we had not half men enough to man our works. I never under&s;tood we had many teams, but I do not recollect the number. What few teams we had were employed in tran&s;porting the &s;tores from Lake George Landing to Lake Champlain.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you recollect, after the enemy landed at Three Mile Point, and before they broke ground, my ordering the men to lie a night or two on their arms?</P>
<P>A. I do.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Did you not under&s;tand the rea&s;on of that order was, that tho' I did not think the enemy were in force, yet I thought they might attempt to carry us by a coup-de-main?</P>
<P>A. I don't recollect it.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Was our force in any degree adequate to the defence of the places?</P>
<P>A. No; I think that the places could not have been maintained unle&s;s with at lea&s;t 10,000 good troops, and we ought to have had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of two hills without the French lines, as al&s;o the one on the other &s;ide of the Lake, known by the name of Mount Defiance.</P>
<P>Major General St. Clair produces a paper, and a&s;ks General Poor whether the matter therein contained was the order of march and di&s;tribution of batteaus, that was agreed upon at the Council on the 5th of July?&mdash; The paper is as follows:</P>

</TEXT></Q>
<P>A. I very well remember the orders, and I think it to be the paper.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you recollect a picket to be advanced, con&s;i&s;ting of the number of men, and under the officers mentioned in the paper?</P>
<P>A. I well remember it. I was de&s;ired by you, when this picket was paraded, to po&s;t them with the other picket, which I think was 150 men, as near the enemy as I could without bringing on an action, and to give them particular orders in the morning, when I was to call them in, that they were to compo&s;e the rear guard, which I did.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Did you not under&s;tand that the rea&s;on of ordering out that picket was, to prevent any &s;urpri&s;e happening to us while the men were employed in carrying the &s;tores and baggage to the landing place?</P>
<P>A. Yes; and likewi&s;e to form a chain of centinels from water to water, to prevent any of our men de|&s;erting to them, and giving them any information.</P>
<P>General St Clair's que&s;tion. Do you recollect the burning of General Fermoy's hou&s;e?</P>
<P>A. Yes; before I called in the pickets on Ticonderoga &s;ide I &s;aw that hou&s;e in flames, which laid the hill that his brigade was on open to the view of the enemy, as I could &s;ee every movement they were making, &s;triking their tents and loading and carrying off their baggage, which induced me to order in the pickets one half an hour &s;ooner than I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have done, as the principal part of the troops on Ticonderoga &s;ide had cro&s;&s;ed the bridge, in order to embark their baggage on board the boats, the wind being &s;o high the boats could not be brought over.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Were not orders given not to &s;et fire to any of the buildings?</P>
<P>A. Yes: You gave me particular orders, as &s;oon as I had po&s;ted the pickets, to communicate your orders with re&s;pect to the evacuation of the place to the commanding officers of regiments in my brigade, and de&s;ired,
<PB N="27" REF="016141_0026_0F9C7A62A46CC888">
as &s;oon as the baggage was packed up, that every light, both from fire and from candle, might be put out, previous to &s;triking the tents and putting the baggage on board the boats. I under&s;tood the rea&s;on was, to prevent the enemy from making any di&s;covery of our intentions; and had not the wind been &s;o very high, which ob&s;tructed the moving of the boats, we &s;hould have been able to have left the place by two o'clock, as was determined on.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Was not the confu&s;ion of marching off the troops from Mount Independence occa&s;ioned by that hou&s;e of General Fermoy's having been &s;et on fire?</P>
<P>A. I believe that was the principal occa&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. How far did the troops march before that confu&s;ion was, in a great mea&s;ure, remedied?</P>
<P>A. I marched in front. I frequently fell back to the rear of my brigade, to examine into their &s;ituation, and before we had marched many miles I got them nearly all together; I can &s;ay nothing with re&s;pect to the others; and the fir&s;t halt we made the brigades were all formed in order, and marched &s;o during the whole retreat, excepting Colonel Leonard's and Colonel Wells's, two militia regiments, who behaved with the greate&s;t di&s;order.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you recollect of one or both of the&s;e regiments having broke the line of march?</P>
<P>A. The day after the evacuation, when we arrived at Otter Creek, we were alarmed by a report that the enemy were ju&s;t in our rear. I, being in front, was ordered to cro&s;s the bridge, and draw the men up upon the mo&s;t advantageous ground I could find. I po&s;ted the regiment that Lieut. Colonel Hale commanded at a ford; he left it, and went off. In the evening, on our march, about a mile and a half from that place, I came up where Colonel Hale was with his regiment. The regiment had four oxen killed and &s;kinned. I a&s;ked him how he came there without leave? he &s;aid he came to get &s;ome provi&s;ion, to prevent his men from &s;tarv|ing. I ordered him to cut up his meat, to be ready to fall into the line of march, which he might be in a few minutes; if not, we &s;hould march but about a mile and a half, and make a halt. I moved on, and in about ten minutes found his regiment running by my brigade, and he nearly at the head of them. He, with about forty of his men, pa&s;&s;ed the brigade. I rode forward, and halted him till part of one regiment of my bri|gade had pa&s;&s;ed him; he came up again, and in&s;i&s;ted on pa&s;&s;ing, as he would not be left in the rear. I turned out about forty men, and ordered them to fire upon them, unle&s;s they would remain on the ground till the line of march came up, where they were to fall in, which halted them. Both regiments frequently broke the line of march.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you recollect, whether the troops, at the time of the evacuation, were ordered to take five days provi&s;ion with them?</P>
<P>A. They were ordered to take &s;everal days provi&s;ion with them, which was judged &s;ufficient to have carried them to the North River, had we pur&s;ued the route we expected to take.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. During my command at Ticonderoga, did you di&s;cover any thing that had the appearance of cowardice in me, or induced you to think me treacherous, or inattentive to the progre&s;s of the enemy?</P>
<P>A. I was once with you where you were in danger, and &s;undry times when we have expected an immediate attack, and never di&s;covered the lea&s;t di&s;compo&s;ure of mind, but you always appeared with the greate&s;t bra|very and &s;teadine&s;s, becoming the character of an officer. From your clo&s;e application to your duty by day, before the enemy made their appearance at Ticonderoga, and your con&s;tant application both by day and night, after they came there, gave me every rea&s;on to imagine you left nothing undone that was in your power to contribute to the &s;trength of the garri&s;on; therefore I had not the lea&s;t rea&s;on to induce me to think you either treacherous or neglectful of your duty, I remember your ob&s;erving to me, if I evacuate the place, my character will be ruined; if I remain here, the army will be lo&s;t; but I am determined to evacuate it, altho' it will give &s;uch an alarm that has not happened in the country &s;ince the war commenced.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. At what time did this conver&s;ation happen. Was it previous to the re&s;olution that was entered into by the Council of War, or po&s;terior to it?</P>
<P>A. It was after it. You gave your rea&s;ons for it, and &s;aid that it was to throw this body of troops between the country and Burgoyne, that the militia might have a body to collect to; which, if this body was cut off, they would have none, and of cour&s;e Burgoyne would pur&s;ue his operations without any ob&s;tacle, or words to that effect.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Were you with me at Trenton or Princeton, and what was my conduct at tho&s;e places with re&s;pect to courage?</P>
<P>A. I was with you at both places. We were not brought to clo&s;e action at either place, but you behaved with the greate&s;t &s;pirit, and with as much coolne&s;s as at any other time.</P>
<P>Q. Court. At what time did General St. Clair receive the fir&s;t compleat intelligence of the &s;trength and de&s;igns of the enemy?</P>
<P>A. I don't recollect any that was obtained before the pri&s;oner was taken; he was the fir&s;t per&s;on that gave us intelligence who commanded the enemy's army, of their &s;trength and de&s;igns, and that not until the next day after he was taken.</P>
<P>Q. Court. Was there any other intelligence received, between the time of the pri&s;oners being taken and the time of the evacuation?</P>
<P>A. There was a report in camp, that &s;ome of the inhabitants &s;aid they were clearing a road through the wood to get into our rear. The Jagers al&s;o mentioned that they were clearing a road.</P>
<P>Q. Court. Do you know whether it was a prevailing opinion, that nothing &s;erious would be attempted again&s;t Ticonderoga that campaign, and whether it was not expected that the enemy's troops would have been &s;ent round from Quebec to the &s;outhern army?</P>
<P>A. A little before General St. Clair arrived at Ticonderoga the enemy made a movement up the Lake, with a number of boats and one or two ve&s;&s;els, tarried a few days, and returned. I acquainted General Gates of it, and further acquainted him that I was informed they were making preparations at St. John's to proceed with their whole army. He wrote me, that he had the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances from Congre&s;s that the King's
<PB N="28" REF="016141_0027_0F9C7A5D6638E1B0">
troops were all ordered round to New-York, leaving only a &s;ufficient number to garri&s;on their forts, and de&s;ire&s;t me to be getting every thing in readine&s;s, that if the enemy went out of one door, we mu&s;t enter the other. He farther mentioned in his letter, that we might daily expect alarms, as they commanded the Lake, and might come up with their &s;hipping, and that the intelligence he had by a &s;py that came from Canada corrobo|rated the &s;entiment of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Q. Court. What orders had the commanding officer of the rear guard, and did he obey the orders he received?</P>
<P>A. He was ordered upon his coming in to &s;weep every thing off the ground upon Ticonderoga &s;ide, to bring every man and bea&s;t, which I under&s;tood he effected, and then to fall in the rear of General Fermoy's brigade, as a rear guard to the army.</P>
<P>Q. Court. What orders did the officer of the rear guard receive at Hubbarton?</P>
<P>A. The fir&s;t halt that was propo&s;ed to be made was at Lacey's camp, which was the fir&s;t cleared land we came to after we left Mount Independence. When I got within about a mile of the place, I met an inhabitant, who informed me there was a large number of the enemy and Indians at Hubbarton, which was two miles farther, which induced me to continue the march until I arrived at Burnam's, in Hubbarton, where it was &s;aid the enemy were. Upon our arrival we were told that about 500 of the enemy had been there, and had gone to Ca&s;tle-Town. There I marked out the ground for each brigade, po&s;ted officers to fall in with his brigade and regiment as they came up. We had then made a march of about twenty miles, which had fatigued many of our feeble men; &s;o that the officer commanding of the rear guard thought proper to halt at the place fir&s;t propo&s;ed, Lacey's camp, two miles in our rear. General St. Clair &s;ent &s;everal times to order the rear guard up; the la&s;t me&s;&s;enger came and &s;aid they were on their way up. As we tarried there about three or four hours, General St. Clair &s;aid he would march to Ca&s;tle-Town with his army, and would leave Colonel Hale's and Warner's regiments to cover his retreat, with orders for them to move on moderately. Some time in the evening I heard the General expre&s;s a good deal of unea&s;ine&s;s and concern that Colonel Francis did not come up with the rear. Towards morning he &s;ent one of his Aids up to order them down immediately; and, if I mi&s;take not, &s;ent a &s;econd time. They did not join the army, but remained until they were attacked by the enemy the next morning.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you know whether the rear guard had orders to move on to Ca&s;tle-Town that night?</P>
<P>A. I cannot &s;ay po&s;itively that they had, but I under&s;tood they had.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you recollect my having &s;ent orders to Colonel Pellows and Colonel Halcott's militia regiments, who were halted two miles from Hubbarton, to march up and &s;upport them upon being attacked?</P>
<P>A. Yes.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Was that order obeyed?</P>
<P>A. It was not. The regiments came directly to us at Ca&s;tle-Town.</P>
<P>Major General St. Clair produces a map of Ticonderoga, Mount Independence and the adjacent country, with references, which Colonel Ko&s;eiu&s;zko, on his oath, &s;ays is a true one, to the be&s;t of his knowledge and judgment, except as to the di&s;tances, it not having been made from actual &s;urvey, but taken from view.</P>

<P>THE Court met according to adjournment.</P>
<P>Captain Woolcott being &s;worn,</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you recollect the orders that were given to Colonel Warner at Hubbarton?</P>
<P>A. I was in front when we arrived at Hubbarton, laid down, and got a &s;leep. When I waked, I found the party were nearly all gone. I a&s;ked Captain Smith where they were gone to, who &s;aid to Ca&s;tle-Town; and having a&s;ked him whether we were to march, he &s;aid it was General St. Clair's orders, delivered by General Patter&s;on, that we were to march to Ca&s;tle-Town. I went into the hou&s;e where Col. Warner, Col. Francis and Col. Hale were, and having a&s;ked Col. Warner whether he determined to march any farther, he &s;aid he did not that night; tho' there were orders to march to Ca&s;tle-Town, he did not intend to go on any farther, becau&s;e the men were much fatigued.</P>
<P>Q. Court. What time did the rear guard arrive at Hubbarton?</P>
<P>A. I believe it was about three or four o'clock in the afternoon.</P>
<P>Q. Court. What time did they leave it the next morning?</P>
<P>A. They commenced their march about eight o'clock, but before the whole got in motion they were at|tacked by the enemy.</P>
<P>Q. Was Colonel Warner the commanding officer of the rear guard at the time?</P>
<P>A. He was.</P>
<P>Colonel Baldwin, being &s;worn, &s;ays, On the 5th of July, 1777, about nine o'clock in the evening, Gene|ral St. Clair &s;ent for me, and told me that he had determined to abandon the place that night; he would have me with the artificers, get all the intrenching tools, and the carpenters and &s;miths tools on board of batteaus that were a&s;&s;igned me for that purpo&s;e, and be ready by two o'clock in the morning to leave the place. I left him and went to my men, got every thing on board belonging to my department agreeable to order, on Ti|conderoga
<PB N="29" REF="016141_0028_0F9C7A6365E76650">
&s;ide, by twelve o'clock. I then went to the &s;tone redoubt, and a&s;ked Captain Win&s;low if he wanted any a&s;&s;i&s;tance? He told me that every thing was out of the magazine and on board the boats, there was nothing left but his tents, that were to be carried. I then went to Head-Quarters, and was informed that General St. Clair was gone over to the Mount. I rode over, and met him near the fort, told him what I had done, and a&s;ked him if he had any further orders? He &s;aid that the people were all a&s;leep on this &s;ide, wi&s;hed that I would go and wake General Fermoy. I went, called him up, and returned. General St. Clair then de&s;ired I would go, and &s;ee to get the &s;tores away from the magazine that was not then open. I &s;oon got a large party of men, went to the magazine, and rolled the barrels from it to the landing (I believe about 100 large barrels of powder.) I then went to the landing, where I found the men in great confu&s;ion, contend|ing about boats. The wind was high, and it was bad loading them; the men very cro&s;s, and hard to be prevailed with to do their duty. About &s;un-ri&s;e the army was pa&s;t and the boats put off. There remained only a few barrels of powder and rum, with a &s;mall matter of baggage on &s;hore, and there were only two batteaus that lay at a little di&s;tance. I promi&s;ed Captain Nicholls, that if he could get the&s;e boats with his carpenters, and carry off what remained at the landing, I would give him a barrel of the rum when he got to Skeen&s;borough; he immediately brought them in, got all on board (except about eight old tents that were not worth carrying, and a howitzer that we run into the Lake and left, with &s;ome carriages for cannon and General St. Clair's waggon) ju&s;t as the enemy came into the works on the hill and fired upon us. The boats pu&s;hed off, and I rode away with Captain Buckland. We &s;aw none of our people (except General St. Clair's waggoner with his hor&s;es; Captain Buckland rode one of them, and we brought off the other) until we came to the la&s;t hou&s;e; there we found four &s;oldiers partly drunk. We made them run until we &s;oon came up with others that were too heavy loaded, and who had &s;topped to throw away a part. We endeavoured to bring all up with us, until we came to Colonel Francis, which was about two miles, as near as I can gue&s;s. He had then fell &s;ome &s;mall di&s;tance in the rear, by rea&s;on of people &s;topping to lighten their packs. I marched &s;ome time with him, but he found the front marched too fa&s;t for him. He de&s;ired I would ride forward to the General, and de&s;ire him to make a &s;mall halt till he could come up, which was done. We marched to Hubbarton, where the front halted two or three hours. We were informed that a large body of the enemy was ju&s;t gone from the place where we halted as the front came up, and were gone towards Ca&s;tle-Town. After the army had refre&s;hed them&s;elves the General ordered Colonel Warner, with &s;ome others, to wait until Colonel Francis came up with the rear guard, and then march on with them; and then General St. Clair marched with the army to Ca&s;tle-Town, and took twenty-&s;ix pri&s;oners on the way&mdash;there halted for that night, the men very much fatigued. On the morning of the &s;eventh the rear, with Colonel Warner and Colonel Francis, was attacked at Hubbarton; we heard the guns. General St. Clair immediately &s;ent one of his Aids to order Colonel Bellows, with two militia regiments (that lay two miles on the road towards the rear) to re|inforce Colonel Francis, and cover his retreat if it was nece&s;&s;ary; but tho&s;e regiments &s;oon came down to us, and I heard the Aid &s;ay that he could not by any means prevail with the men to obey the order, and Colonel Bellows did all in his power to get the men to go with him to meet the enemy. The General this morning heard our boats were cut off at Skeen&s;borough, which cau&s;ed him to alter his route, and go by the way of Rutland.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you recollect whether the working parties at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were increa&s;ed or decrea&s;ed on or about the 23d day of June, 1777?</P>
<P>A. They were con&s;iderably increa&s;ed. There were &s;everal works that were not fini&s;hed that were ordered to be done, be&s;ides a number of new ones laid out that the men were ordered to work upon, and we continued at the&s;e works both at Mount Independence and Ticonderoga until the day we came away, be&s;ides a con&s;ider|able reinforcement to the party at work upon the bridge. As the troops increa&s;ed the working parties increa&s;ed, we having almo&s;t every man upon the ground on duty of one kind or another. There was a regiment of militia con&s;tantly on duty in the woods, under my direction, providing timber for the bridge, that was not included in the details. I had about 100 men, be&s;ides the militia on duty with me there, that were not included in the details. I had about 30 out of the militia al&s;o making &s;hingles, and a party making brick, not included in the details.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Was the boom that was laid below the bridge in the Lake fixed in &s;uch a manner, that it would have been able to have re&s;i&s;ted the &s;hock of a ve&s;&s;el?</P>
<P>A. The anchors were chiefly lo&s;t from it, the cables having been broken by the ice. I rather think it would not have &s;topped their heavy ve&s;&s;els, though it might their &s;maller ones.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Did you receive directions for building a general ho&s;pital at Ticonderoga, and were you not employed on that work?</P>
<P>A. I did, from General Schuyler. I was at work on it about the 23d of June, and the greater part of the fatigue-men were then taken from that work to be put on other works. Some of the artificers were taken off, though the greater part of them continued at work on it.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. What di&s;tance is the la&s;t hou&s;e you have mentioned from Mount Independence?</P>
<P>A. I believe not more than a quarter of a mile from the landing upon the &s;outh &s;ide of the Mount.</P>
<P>Captain Win&s;low being &s;worn.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. What part of the artillery, and at what po&s;t, did you command at Ticon|deroga?</P>
<P>A. I commanded in a &s;tone redoubt, where there were thirteen pieces of artillery.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Were the artillery and &s;tores that were in that redoubt removed at the time of the evacuation.?</P>
<P>A. The &s;tores were all removed, and &s;ix of the pieces of artillery. I loaded the cannon in a flat bottomed boat that was given me to load them in, and was ordered, I think by General Poor, afterwards to take them out to put the baggage in. There were al&s;o 40 barrels of powder there, which, with the &s;tores, I loaded my&s;elf in the boats to go to Skeen&s;borough, after I had got tho&s;e articles down. I was then ordered by General St. Clair, as I was coming up from the boats, to &s;pike up the remainder of the cannon, to go to the old fort to a&s;&s;i&s;t in removing the &s;tores from thence.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Were the &s;tores generally removed from the old fort?</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="016141_0029_0F9C7A64242138C8">A. Every thing of any con&s;equence was. They were all carried down to the boats at lea&s;t, if they were not put on board.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Were the cannon all &s;piked that were left?</P>
<P>A. I &s;piked all that I had the care of, and &s;ome more that were at the &s;hore that were brought from the French lines, that could not be embarked.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Were you Payma&s;ter to the troops at Ticonderoga?</P>
<P>A. I was.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Was the military che&s;t &s;aved?</P>
<P>A. It was. I &s;ent it away the morning of the evacuation, about three o'clock, with four of my men. You ordered me to &s;end it away &s;ooner, but I could not get a boat to do it.</P>
<P>Q. Did the &s;tores that were &s;ent from Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, at the time of the evacuation, fall into the hands of the enemy afterwards?</P>
<P>A. They did, after they arrived at Skeen&s;borough; though there might have been &s;ome boats that fell into their hands before they got up to Skeen&s;borough.</P>
<P>Q. To Colonel Hay. Did the &s;tores that were &s;ent from Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, at the time of the evacuation, fall into the hands of the enemy afterwards?</P>
<P>A. They did at Skeen&s;borough, after an engagement between the enemy's ve&s;&s;els and ours.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion to Col. Hay. Was not a great part of them de&s;troyed by fire by our people?</P>
<P>A. One of the ve&s;&s;els was blown up.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion to Col. Hay. Do you recollect the number of batteaus that were at Ticonderoga, fit for &s;ervice?</P>
<P>A. Not po&s;itively, but I imagine they were about 70</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion to Col. Hay. Was the boom below the bridge &s;o &s;ecured, that it could re&s;i&s;t the &s;hock of a ve&s;&s;el?</P>
<P>A. It was &s;ecured with several anchors and cables. It would have &s;topped a ve&s;&s;el's way, &s;o far as to have expo&s;ed her to the fire from on both &s;ides, and made it difficult for her to get back again; but if a ve&s;&s;el came again&s;t it with a full wind, I never thought it would have re&s;i&s;ted her.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion to Col. Hay. Was the wind fair the night of the evacuation for ve&s;&s;els to come up again&s;t it?</P>
<P>A. It was, and blowed very hard.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion to Col. Hay. If the enemy had attempted it that night, was it not probable they would have broke through every ob&s;truction?</P>
<P>A. I am of opinion they would have carried away our boom and broke our floating bridge, but mu&s;t probably, by that means, have been thrown athwart &s;ome of the caffoons, and thereby expo&s;ed to the fire of our batteries on both &s;ides, until the cannon were removed or &s;piked up.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Colonel Stevens being &s;worn,</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Did you command the artillery at Ticonderoga at the time of the evacuation?</P>
<P>A. I did.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you recollect what orders were given to you at the time of the evacuation?</P>
<P>A. About &s;even o'clock in the evening of the 5th of July was the fir&s;t of my hearing of the intended evacuation. You waited on me at my quarters (as I was unwell) and informed me that the retreat was to take place that night. On the information, I told you I had rea&s;on to cur&s;e the day I ever put my feet into the country, there being &s;o much retreating. Yoy &s;aid that you had the greate&s;t rea&s;on to cur&s;e the day, and intimated that more blame would fall on you than on me for lo&s;ing the artillery. You then advi&s;ed with me what artillery to bring off, and was anxious for bringing the whole off, and offered me what a&s;&s;i&s;tance I wanted. I told you it was impo&s;&s;ible to bring the whole off, on account of the deficiency of boats; and 500 men were turned out to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance. You had agreed to move all the pieces except the eighteen pounders, and tho&s;e above them, which I got to the landing, but the &s;carcity of boats was the occa&s;ion of my leaving &s;ome of them there. I did make out to get a number of them to Skeen&s;borough, but they were lo&s;t there. I &s;hould have got the whole there, had not the boats been taken up by General Poor for the men's baggage, into which the pieces were to go. The boats with the ammunition and powder had reached almo&s;t to Skeen&s;borough before the enemy came up with them. One of them we &s;et fire to, with fifteen tons of powder, which blew up; the re&s;t fell into the hands of the enemy.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Were not orders given to &s;pike up all the cannon tha could not be removed?</P>
<P>A. There were.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Was that done?</P>
<P>A. It was. You advi&s;ed with me about knocking the trunnions off, but being fearful it would make too much noi&s;e and alarm the enemy, as they were &s;o near, it was omitted.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Was there any artillery ordered to be fired that night, to amu&s;e the enemy?</P>
<P>A. There were two eighteen pounders in the Jer&s;ey battery fired every &s;even minutes at their &s;hipping, and at a battery that the enemy were rai&s;ing oppo&s;ite to the Jer&s;ey battery, which continued till near &s;un-ri&s;e the next morning, to amu&s;e them.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. At the time the enemy moved up with their gun boats, as if they meant to attack the Jer&s;ey battery, do you recollect what pa&s;&s;ed at the time between you and me?</P>
<P>A. You &s;eemed to be angry at me for firing without your po&s;itive orders, and &s;aid you would rather give fifty pounds than I &s;hould have fired.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you recollect my explaining to you the rea&s;on of my &s;aying &s;o?</P>
<P>A. I do not recollect your explaining to me the rea&s;on. You expre&s;&s;ed in your di&s;cour&s;e to me, that you wi&s;hed they would come nearer, that we might have a fairer chance to &s;ink them; and I judged that it was on account of your thinking they were not near enough.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Did you receive any orders for di&s;mounting and moving the cannon at Ti|conderoga?</P>
<P>A. I did about the latter end of June, or beginning of July, from General Schuyler, and moved all the
<PB N="31" REF="016141_0030_0F9C7A64E4998D78">
cannon above a twelve pounder, except the two eighteen pounders which were left at the Jer&s;ey battery, to Mount Independence, and laid them on &s;kids, with their vents down, which induced the &s;oldiers to think that a retreat was intended from Ticonderoga to Mount Independence. I moved al&s;o the ammunition by your orders, except about one hundred rounds, to Mount Independence.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Was all the fixed ammunition removed at the time of the evacuation?</P>
<P>A. I have the greate&s;t rea&s;on to think that all was brought off.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Was there any annoyance given by the artillery to the enemy in their ap|proaches to the place?</P>
<P>A. They were fired upon from the French lines, and from every quarter where they made their appear|ance, by heavy artillery, from the fir&s;t of their approach to the evacuation.</P>
<P>Mr. Boyer being &s;worn, General St. Clair's que&s;tion. In what &s;tation did you act at Ticonderoga?</P>
<P>A. As an A&s;&s;i&s;tant Commi&s;&s;ary of Provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. When I called on you on the 5th of July for a return of provi&s;ion, what quantity did you report to me to be on hand?</P>
<P>A. I imagine there were two thou&s;and barrels of flour, and eight hundred barrels of beef and pork, the greater part was pork, and it was about that quantity I reported to you there was.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you recollect what quantity of provi&s;ion was i&s;&s;ued as a ration at Ti|conderoga?</P>
<P>A. I think, but am not po&s;itive, there was i&s;&s;ued for a ration, one pound of bread, one pound of beef, or three quarters of a pound of pork in lieu of beef. That was all they daily drew. The other parts of a ration I do not remember.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Was there any allowance made to the men for the &s;mall articles you could not furni&s;h them with?</P>
<P>A. They had briefs given them for them.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. How long were you A&s;&s;i&s;tant Commi&s;&s;ary at that place?</P>
<P>A. About &s;ix weeks.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Had you received any directions from any of the principals in the depart|ment, what quantity of provi&s;ion to i&s;&s;ue as a daily ration?</P>
<P>A. I do not remember that I had.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Did you not i&s;&s;ue the &s;ame ration that had been i&s;&s;ued before you came into office?</P>
<P>A. I i&s;&s;ued the &s;ame quantity that had been i&s;&s;ued before I came into the office.</P>

<P>THIS may certify, that the detachment of Colonel Michael Jack&s;on's regiment, which was under my command at Ticonderoga at the time of its evacuation, was very poorly cloathed, many of their arms out of repair, and about one third of them de&s;titute of bayonets.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear General,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I INFORMED you ye&s;terday that an encampment of the enemy had been di&s;covered at Gilliland's Creek. I a&s;t night two of their ve&s;&s;els came up to Crown Point, and this morning there are &s;even lying at that place; the re&s;t of their fleet is probably but a little lower down, as we heard their morning guns di&s;tinctly at different places. They have al&s;o debarked &s;ome troops, and encamped upon Chimney Point. Whether
<PB N="33" REF="016141_0032_0F9C7A6665CA4160">
they have landed at Crown Point my &s;cout-boat did not di&s;cover, not daring to venture far enough down the Lake for that purpo&s;e, on account of their &s;hipping; but I have &s;ent a party on this &s;ide the river, which, I doubt not, will bring a ju&s;t account of their &s;ituation.</P>
<P>I cannot help repeating to you the di&s;agreeable &s;ituation we are in, nor can I &s;ee the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of our being able to defend the po&s;ts, unle&s;s the militia come in; and &s;hould the enemy protract their operations, or inve&s;t us, and content them&s;elves with a &s;imple blockade, we are infallibly ruined. I have thoughts of calling for the Berk&s;hire militia, which are neare&s;t to us, and will probably be the mo&s;t alert to come to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, becau&s;e they are in &s;ome mea&s;ure covered by this po&s;t; but on that I &s;hall con&s;ult the other General Officers. This, however, is clear to me, that we &s;hall be obliged to abandon this &s;ide, and then they will &s;oon force the other from us; nor do I &s;ee that a retreat will in any &s;hape be practicable. Every thing, however, &s;hall be done, that is po&s;&s;ible, to fru&s;trate the de&s;igns of the enemy; but what can be expected from troops ill armed, naked and unaccoutred. I &s;hall write you again as &s;oon as the &s;cout returns,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS moment I have received information from Hoite, of Otter Creek, that a large party of Indians and Tories are gone up that creek, &s;uppo&s;ed to be five hundred, and are de&s;igned to cut off the communi|cation by Skeen&s;borough. They took a pair of oxen from one of the inhabitants, and drove them to about two miles above Middlebury Falls, where they halted the day before ye&s;terday, and killed and dre&s;&s;ed the cattle; and it is &s;uppo&s;ed that to-night they will be at the new road near Ca&s;tle-Town, which is twenty-eight miles from hence, and twelve or fourteen from Skeen&s;borough. They reported that a very large party were gone on the we&s;t &s;ide of the Lake, to fall on Fort George. That is &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of 1000 Indians and Canadians.</P>
<P>We have al&s;o had ju&s;t now another attack at the mills; we have two men killed, two taken, and two wounded, one mortally. The &s;cene thickens fa&s;t, and Sunday next, it &s;eems, is fixed for the attack on this place. We mu&s;t make the be&s;t we can of it, and I hope at lea&s;t to cripple them &s;o as they may not be able to pur&s;ue their fortune, &s;hould it declare in their favour.</P>
<P>I &s;ent a party down la&s;t night to reconnoitre them, who are not yet returned, which gives me &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s. I hope, however, they are &s;afe, and will bring me &s;ome intelligence of con&s;equence. I have &s;ome thoughts, if they are not numerous, of attacking them. If they get the wor&s;t, it will oblige them to recal their parties. If not, there will be too many &s;till left, to become pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent to the Grants to inform them of the Otter Creek party, and to de&s;ire that all they can po&s;&s;ibly &s;pare of the militia may be ready to march at a minute's warning.</P>

<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. What troops had you e&s;timated for the defence of the garri&s;ons of Ticonde|roga and Mount Independence?</P>
<P>A. Ten thou&s;and continental troops. I do not know that I mentioned in my letter to General Wa&s;hington and to Congre&s;s that they &s;hould be continental troops, but I intended them to have been continental troops.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Did you think the po&s;ts tenable with the force I had?</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Albany,</HI>
<DATE><HI>June</HI> 8, 1777.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO my&s;elf the honour to advi&s;e you that I arrived here on Tue&s;day, the 3d in&s;tant, and found an ac|count, which I received on my way up, that the enemy were approaching Ticonderoga, to be without foundation.</P>
<P>I inclo&s;e you, Sir, a return of the troops at Ticonderoga and this place. As &s;oon as I procure tho&s;e from the other po&s;ts, I &s;hall make out a general return, and do my&s;elf the honour to tran&s;mit copies to you and his Excellency General Wa&s;hington.</P>
<P>You will perceive, by the return of the Commi&s;&s;ary of Provi&s;ion, which I al&s;o inclo&s;e, that only 337 bar|rels of provi&s;ion, of the meat kind, have been forwarded to Ticonderoga &s;ince the 26th of March, and no fre&s;h beef; &s;o that the &s;tock of &s;alted provi&s;ion &s;ince that time is con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed, nor is there any con&s;iderable quantity provided in the country. I have, therefore, directed the Commi&s;&s;ary to forward an immediate &s;upply of fre&s;h beef, that as much of the &s;alted beef and pork may be &s;aved as po&s;&s;ible, in order to have a &s;tock on hand, in ca&s;e the enemy &s;hould be able &s;o to interrupt the communication, as to prevent cattle being &s;ent on.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;e you copy of the in&s;tructions I have given General St. Clair: I have directed that Mount Independ|ence &s;hould be the primary object, of attention.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> Becau&s;e, if the lines on the we&s;t &s;ide &s;hould be perfectly compleated, it will not be in our power to man them properly with the whole force de&s;tined for this department, if it could be all collected at Ticon|deroga, which it cannot; for the &s;everal po&s;ts on the Mohawk river, and tho&s;e on the communication between this and Ticonderoga, will take at lea&s;t 2000 men. I have in view the drawing part of the army to this &s;ide of the Lake.</P>
<P><HI>Second.</HI> Becau&s;e I think it rather imprudent that the greater part of our army &s;hould occupy a po&s;t, which, if the enemy &s;hould be able &s;o to inve&s;t, as to cut off the communication with the country on this &s;ide, we might po&s;&s;ibly experience a di&s;a&s;ter &s;imilar to that at Fort Wa&s;hington.</P>
<P><HI>Third.</HI> I am fully convinced that between 2 and 3000 men can effectually maintain Mount Independence, and &s;ecure the pa&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Fourth.</HI> If the whole army was at Mount Independence, it is po&s;&s;ible that a want of provi&s;ion might oblige us to abandon that important po&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="016141_0033_0F9C7A67EFB739A8"><HI>Fifth.</HI> If the enemy &s;hould attempt to draw their boats over land into Lake George from beyond the Three Mile Point, our naval &s;trength on Lake George will prevent their progre&s;s: If it did not, we &s;hall have a body of troops to oppo&s;e them with.</P>
<P><HI>Sixth.</HI> Becau&s;e, if Mount Independence &s;hould be inve&s;ted, the militia will readily join when they have an army to join, and the &s;eige may be rai&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>Seventh.</HI> Becau&s;e, if they &s;hould attempt to march a body of troops from Crown Point, leaving Ticonde|roga on their left (by the road la&s;t year cut by the tories who joined General Carlton) to interrupt the com|munication, there will be a force to meet them, and to prevent the evil con&s;equences of &s;uch a manoeuvre of their's.</P>
<P><HI>Eighth.</HI> Becau&s;e, if a &s;udden irruption &s;hould be made on the Mohawk River, or from New-York by Hud&s;on's River, a force will be at hand to face them. Be&s;ides the&s;e con&s;iderations, there are oeconomical ones al&s;o to induce me to this di&s;po&s;ition of the army, if it can be done without injury, which I am fully of opinion it may, and will certainly be &s;o, if General Carlton &s;ent part of the troops, from Canada to New-York or <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">where.</P>

</LETTER></P>
<P>General Schuyler &s;ays further, in an&s;wer to the que&s;tion, that when he mentioned in the letter to Congre&s;s that between two and three thou&s;and men were &s;ufficient to have maintained Mount Independence, he con|ceived the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ort, about which orders had been given the beginning of February to Colonel Baldwin, was far advanced; that the ob&s;truction in the Lake was compleated; that there were carriages provided for the can|non; that the lines were compleated, and not by one half &s;o exten&s;ive as he found them.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Did you ever give me any orders for evacuating the&s;e garri&s;ons?</P>
<P>A. No. The rea&s;on why I did not give you any orders for evacuating the&s;e garri&s;ons was, becau&s;e I had wrote this letter to Congre&s;s, and they did not give me any orders about it; and as the continent conceived them of great importance, and very &s;trong, I did not think my&s;elf at liberty to give any orders for an evacuation of them.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Was the defective &s;tate in which you found the works at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence owing to any negligence in me, or di&s;regard to the orders I received from you?</P>
<P>A. It could not be owing to any negligence in you, or di&s;regard to the orders you received from me, as you had arrived there but a few days before; not was it owing to the negligence of any officer who had com|manded there in the winter or &s;pring before; nor to the commanding officer of the artiliery or the engineer. I conceive it to be owing to a want of men and a want of materials.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you know of any &s;teps taken by the ea&s;tern &s;tates to reinforce the&s;e po&s;ts, after their inve&s;titure?</P>
<P>A. Immediately on my return from Ticonderoga, I wrote to the ea&s;tern &s;tates to ha&s;ten on the remainder of the continental troops. Some troops came up in con&s;equence of my application, but did not reach Albany till &s;ome time after the evacuation of Ticonderoga. Upon receiving the fir&s;t letter from you after I returned from Ticonderoga, I applied to the ea&s;tern &s;tates, and to this, for reinforcements of militia. The militia from the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts arrived at Fort-Edward, I believe, between the 4th and 7th of July. A few from Connecticut did not join us until towards the latter end of July. Tho&s;e from this &s;tate got up much about the &s;ame time that the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts did. The Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts militia were up as &s;oon at Fort-Edward, and tho&s;e from this &s;tate, as I could rea&s;onably expect them to be. Connecticut, as I was informed by Governor Trumbull, had a call for the militia from General Wa&s;hington, to go to the Highland, or Peeks-Kill. That was the rea&s;on that their militia did not join us &s;ooner.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Did the force you had collected, &s;uppo&s;ing the garri&s;ons to have held out, put you in a &s;ituation to have rai&s;ed the &s;iege?</P>
<P>A. I believe that, with all the troops you brought with you, with the reinforcement with General Nixon, and including all the militia, I had not at Fort-Edward, about the 20th of July, more than five thou&s;and men. If the garri&s;on had remained, I &s;hould have had no more than three thou&s;and militia, before I was joined by General Nixon, to have marched to its relief, which number I conceive very inadequate to have rai&s;ed the &s;iege. General Nixon, I believe, arrived about the 12th or 13th of July; but if I had had a force which I might think was &s;ufficient, yet I &s;hould not have been able to have rai&s;ed the &s;iege for want of pro|vi&s;ion, there being &s;carcely any provi&s;ion of the meat kind in the department; flour was plenty. Nor was there any &s;tock of provi&s;ion of the meat kind laid in, not even a &s;ufficiency of &s;alted meat to have fur|ni&s;hed the &s;couts with. We had not lead in the department &s;ufficient for an army any thing like to have rai&s;ed the &s;iege with. At Fort-Edward, on the 7th of July, we were obliged to &s;trip the men that were there of every cartridge they had, to &s;end them to Fort-Ann, and were left without any lead for &s;ome days, excepting a mere trifle I got from Albany, a very &s;mall quantity brought up by the militia, and by &s;tripping the windows.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Do you know the u&s;ual weight of a barrel of beef or pork in that country?</P>
<P>A. Barrels of beef or pork &s;hould weigh, when they are well packed, about 200 weight; but I have fre|quently complained that the barrels of beef or pork of the Commi&s;&s;ary's were not in well packed as they ought to be, owing to their making u&s;e of &s;oldiers and others, whom I &s;uppo&s;ed did not under&s;tand the bu&s;i|ne&s;s &s;o well, &s;o that the barrels were but &s;lighty packed. I have &s;een &s;ome that I &s;uppo&s;e a quarter of meat might have been put in more, others that the deficiency was le&s;s. I &s;hould imagine, if the re&s;t of the barrels were the &s;ame as tho&s;e I in&s;pected into, they would not have averaged more than 170 pounds each.</P>
<P>General St. Clair's que&s;tion. Did I not, when it was determined in the Council of Officers that was held the 20th of June, 1777, re&s;pecting the holding Mount Independence and evacuating Ticonderoga, expre&s;s my opinion that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to hold that po&s;t, when the other &s;ide of the Lake &s;hould be abandoned?</P>
<P>A. I remember perfectly well you did.</P>

<P>Major Dunn, Aid de Camp to General St. Clair, being &s;worn, &s;ays:</P>
<P>I arrived at Ticonderoga about the 18th of June, 1777. A day or two after my arrival I went round the lines on Ticonderoga, and found them much in the &s;ame &s;ituation as they were in November, 1776, except|ing the redoubts on the low ground, which were evacuated, and a chain of new ones erected on the height between the old &s;ort and the right of the French lines. The&s;e were nearly compleated. In &s;ome cannon were mounted, and a party of fatigue at work on the re&s;t. On Mount Independence I found a party of about 100 men, under the direction of Colonel Ko&s;eiu&s;zko, erecting three redoubts in the rear of the Mount, and forming an abbatis, the old one having taken fire &s;ome time before, and was chiefly de&s;troyed. One other party of about 150 men, under Colonel Baldwin, &s;inking a number of piers in the pa&s;&s;age between the two po&s;ts. One other fatigue party, employed daily in bringing &s;tores and provi&s;ion from Lake George Land|ing. Be&s;ides the&s;e, Colonel Hay, the Quarter-Ma&s;ter General, had a party of Negroes, taken from the different regiments, as a con&s;tant fatigue, independent of the daily detail. There were two regiments of militia cutting logs for the piers then &s;inking, the&s;e were likewi&s;e independent of the daily detail, and exempt from all other garri&s;on duty. All the&s;e parties of fatigue were continued as above, with very little alteration, till the evacuation took place. Being the only Aid de Camp belonging to General St Clair's family, mo&s;t of the orders delivered were through me, and therefore I had the greate&s;t opportunities of &s;eeing all parties that were &s;ent out; and after my arrival, I do not remember a day that parties were not &s;ent out on the ea&s;t or we&s;t, and frequently on both &s;ides of the Lake Champlain, to reconnoitre the Lake and woods. Tho&s;e parties con&s;i&s;ted from 15 to 50 men. I do not recollect exactly the time the enemy fir&s;t made their appearance on the Lake, but remember perfectly, after their appearing with their fleet at Split-Rock, that no party could be per&s;waded (becau&s;e of the &s;avages) to approach near enough to di&s;cover any thing of con&s;equence. They frequently fell in with the enemy's parties, but were always obliged to retire. In this &s;tate we remained till the enemy landed on Three Mile Point, I think on the 30th of June; and on this occa&s;ion I heard the Ge|neral complain that his garri&s;on was not in force to ri&s;que a party large enough to do them any damage. This occa&s;ioned the parties being reduced; &s;ometimes not more than one officer, and two or three men, was thought the mo&s;t eligible mode to di&s;cover the movements of the enemy. A look-out boat was al&s;o &s;tationed between the enemy's fleet and the Jer&s;ey redoubt, to apprize the garri&s;on of any movement in the fleet. On the enemy's landing at the point, the General ordered all the provi&s;ion and &s;tores at Lake George Landing immediately removed into the lines; the batteaus and boats to be in readine&s;s to move to Fort George on the &s;horte&s;t notice. The enemy, advancing towards the lines, on the fir&s;t or &s;econd day of July took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heights between the landing and the old French lines. The boats were ordered to move to Fort George, and the troops po&s;ted at the landing and &s;aw-mills ordered into the garri&s;on, which was effected without any lo&s;s. The communication between the garri&s;on and Lake George was now effectually cut off, the enemy being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heights in our front. Their light parties made frequent attacks on our picket, which con&s;i&s;ted of fifty men, po&s;ted &s;ome di&s;tance in front of the lines. On tho&s;e occa&s;ions, and every other alarm that came to my knowledge (and I believe none e&s;caped me) the Ge|neral always appeared at the lines, going from right to left encouraging the troops, putting them in mind of the cau&s;e they were engaged in, telling them to keep them&s;elves cool, and not to throw away their fire if the enemy &s;hould approach; that he wi&s;hed for nothing more than a &s;erious attack, and did not doubt but we &s;hould repul&s;e them if they did attack. Such was the General's per&s;onal attention to the po&s;ts, and the movements of the enemy, after they landed at Three Mile Point, that I do not believe he &s;lept one hour in four and twenty, on an average, till the evacuation took place. As to the quantity of provi&s;ion I can &s;ay but little; but I recollect, &s;oon after my arrival. General Schuyler's expre&s;&s;ing great &s;urprize that no magazines were formed at Albany, or any other place nearer than that, for the &s;upply of the garri&s;on. He &s;ent Mr. Yancey immediately to the country, and pre&s;&s;ed him in the &s;tronge&s;t terms to &s;pare no pains in ob|taining provi&s;ion for the po&s;t; that if the enemy &s;hould come on, we &s;hould be reduced by famine; adding, at the &s;ame time, that the neglect of the Commi&s;&s;aries had been &s;uch, that he believed it would be &s;erving the public to hang at lea&s;t one of the department.&mdash;The following are the particulars I recollect re&s;pecting the retreat. About eight o'clock in the evening, July 5. I &s;aw the ammunition and cannon removing on board the ve&s;&s;els and to Mount Independence. I was at this time ignorant of the retreat. About nine o'clock the &s;ame evening General St. Clair &s;ent me with orders to General Fermoy, that he &s;hould direct all the &s;tores, ammunition, cannon, baggage, &amp;c. to be taken to the foot of the hill on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Mount, where they were to be put on board batteaus for Skeen&s;borough. I returned, after delivering the order, to Ticon|deroga, and was &s;ent by the General with orders to the Officer in the Jer&s;ey redoubt, to continue firing his cannon every half hour towards the battery the enemy were erecting oppo&s;ite to the redoubt till further orders. About twelve o'clock the &s;ame evening I was again &s;ent to Mount Independence. I found General Fermoy near his hou&s;e, with his own baggage. I went to the landing, where I found Colonel Hay directing the loading the boats, with between three and four hundred men carrying down the &s;tores, &amp;c. but, for want of proper orders and attention from General Fermoy, every thing appeared in the greate&s;t confu&s;ion. About this time they began to &s;trike their tents on Mount Independence, all of which, I believe, were put on board the boats. At two o'clock General St. Clair left Ticonderoga, all the &s;tores, ammunition, artillery and camp equipage from that &s;ide being removed, except the heavy cannon, which, from our &s;mall number of men and want of draught cattle, could not then be removed. All the tents and ho&s;pital &s;tores, mo&s;t of the am|munition
<PB N="36" REF="016141_0035_0F9C7A7625004E28">
and light cannon, were al&s;o removed from Mount Independence. Some provi&s;ion, I cannot &s;ay what quantity, and mo&s;t of the heavy cannon, were left; all the batteaus and boats were however loaded. About three o'clock in the morning the troops were put in motion for the evacuation, but General Fermoy having &s;et fire to his hou&s;e (contrary to po&s;itive orders) which lighted the whole Mount, and gave the enemy an opportunity of &s;eeing every movement we made, it damped the &s;pirits of our own troops; the militia re|giments pu&s;hed out of the Mount in di&s;order, and were followed by a number of continental troops; the guards from Ticonderoga had al&s;o to pa&s;s the light, and ru&s;hed forward in confu&s;ion. The General at this time rode to the front, and obliged them to halt, and formed a line of march in rank and file, the roughne&s;s of the country and badne&s;s of the road permitting no other. Having effected this, he returned to the rear, which &s;till remained at the foot of the Mount. It was near four in the morning when the rear began to march. Colonel Francis, who commanded the rear guard, followed immediately after, and the line continued in good order till we arrived at Hubbarton, where the whole were halted to refre&s;h. The halt was near two hours. Mo&s;t of the &s;tragglers and rear guard having joined us, the army was again put in motion. The rear guard here was given to Colonel Warner, with orders to halt about one and a half mile &s;hort of the main body, which would remain that night at Ca&s;tle-Town, about &s;ix miles from Hubbarton, and to march in the morning by four, and join the main body. In the morning the General paraded the army, and waited near two hours for the rear guard. About &s;even o'clock a firing began on Warner's party, and on enquiry found he had halted at Hubbarton. The General expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urprize that his orders were di&s;obeyed. He di&s;patched my&s;elf and Major Living&s;ton to order two militia regiments, that had halted between the main body and Warner, to reinforce him (the&s;e regiments were commanded by Colonel Bellows) and if the enemy &s;hould appear in much &s;uperior force, that Warner &s;hould retreat to Rutland, where the main body would be to cover him. Tho&s;e regiments of militia refu&s;ed to go up, tho' po&s;itively commanded, and afterwards intreated, by Colonel Bellows. This delay occa&s;ioned Warner's retreat to Rutland, where the main body received him. The militia regiments returned, and although my&s;elf on hor&s;eback, and three miles from the main body, they arrived there with me. I rode expre&s;s.</P>
<P>Q. Court. Be&s;ides the parties you have mentioned on fatigue, do you recollect whether there was a brigade ordered for fatigue on Mount Independence about the 23d of June?</P>
<P>A. I do recollect there was a brigade ordered for fatigue on Mount Independence about that time, which was exclu&s;ive of the parties for fatigue I have mentioned.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know the time General St. Clair received information of the &s;trength and de&s;igns of the enemy?</P>
<P>A. I do not know the time.</P>
<P>Q. Did General St. Clair remove any of his baggage from Ticonderoga at any time previous to the evacuation?</P>
<P>A. No part of it. His &s;on went off, I believe, about a week before, but did not even carry all his own baggage with him. About the time General St. Clair's &s;on went away, General Fermoy's baggage was removed from Head-Quarters to Mount Independence, he having lived with the General until that time.</P>
<P>Q. What di&s;tance is Split-Rock from Ticonderoga?</P>
<P>A. About thirty-&s;even miles.</P>
<P>Q. What di&s;tance is Gilliland's Creek from Ticonderoga?</P>
<P>A. About forty-two miles.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Colonel Living&s;ton, Aid de Camp to General Schuyler, being &s;worn, &s;ays:</P>
<P>About the middle of June, 1777, General St. Clair (agreeable to orders from General Schuyler) took upon him&s;elf the command of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence. A few days after I went to Ticonderoga, in company with General Schuyler. After being there a few days. General Schuyler found it nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ervice to return to Albany, and the command in that department continued in General, St. Clair, with whom I had the honour of &s;erving during the &s;iege and on the retreat. Previous to the enemy's appear|ance before Ticonderoga, every method was made u&s;e of to gain intelligence of their movements and intentions. For this purpo&s;e &s;couting parties, properly officered, were kept out on the ea&s;t and we&s;t &s;ides of Lake Cham|plain. The&s;e parties were generally &s;elected from a corps of rangers, who had been accu&s;tomed to &s;ervices of this kind. The General did not confine his attention to the article of intelligence alone. No mea&s;ures were neglected to &s;trengthen the works on both &s;ides of the Lake. Fatigue parties were daily employed in this duty, and the direction of them generally committed to Colonel Ko&s;eiu&s;zko, an active officer, who acted as an a&s;&s;i&s;tant engineer in the northern department. The ob&s;tructions of the navigation at Lake Champlain was al&s;o attended to. Be&s;ides a very &s;light boom, which had been thrown acro&s;s the Lake during the command of General Gates, large ca&s;&s;oons were &s;unk between Mount Independence and Ticonderoga, altho' this ar|duous work was not compleated when the evacuation took place. On the 26th of June, or thereabouts, our &s;couts ob&s;erved an encampment of the enemy at Crown-Point, fifteen miles from Ticonderoga. From this time it became exceedingly difficult to procure any intelligence of the &s;trength or movements of the enemy, as the woods between us and Crown-Point were &s;o infe&s;ted with &s;avages as to render it exceedingly hazardous to &s;end &s;mall parties that way, and the force of the garri&s;on was too weak to ju&s;tify the detaching a large number. Not many days after, I think it was on the la&s;t of June, the enemy's gun-boats appeared off Three Mile Point. The &s;ame day there was a &s;kirmi&s;h between a &s;cout from the garri&s;on and the enemy. Our party were wor&s;ted, and obliged to retire with a little lo&s;s. A con&s;iderable body of the enemy then took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mount-Hope. This height commanded the road between Ticonderoga and the North Landing of Lake George. It had been fortified by us the preceding year, but was di&s;mantled long before General St. Clair's arrival in that quarter. The old block-hou&s;e at the north end of Lake George was &s;till in our hands. A &s;ubaltern's guard was left in it, to protect the public &s;tores which were lying at that landing. The enemy did not &s;uffer this officer to remain long in peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; they attacked him with &s;mall arms, and were repul&s;ed. The General, aware of the dangerous &s;ituation of the block-hou&s;e, and that the &s;mall garri&s;on there mu&s;t &s;oon be overpowered by numbers, or be obliged to &s;ubmit on the appearance of artillery, judged it nece&s;&s;ary to order them within the lines. This was effected ju&s;t in time, and without lo&s;s. The Communication between Ticonderoga and Lake George, by the main road, was now entirely cut off, which rendered it impracticable to bring the &s;tores from the Lake within the fort. There was now
<PB N="37" REF="016141_0036_0F9C7A77A54AB120">
great danger of their falling into the enemy's hands. To prevent a lo&s;s of this kind, the General ordered the &s;tores to be immediately put on board the batteaus, and carried back to Fort George, on the &s;outh &s;ide of the Lake. This &s;ervice was executed without lo&s;s, and no further communication po&s;&s;ible between Ticon|deroga and the country by the way of Lake George. The enemy continued to make their approaches on the Ticonderoga &s;ide of the Lake. It was impo&s;&s;ible, from the weakne&s;s of the garri&s;on, and the great extent of works we had to defend, to give them much interruption in their approaches. But the movement of the enemy, which gave the greate&s;t alarm to the garri&s;on, was the very rapid progre&s;s they made in clearing a road, and getting artillery on Sugar Hill or Mount Defiance. This proceeding was the more &s;urpri&s;ing, as it had been in agitation during the command of General Gates (in the fall of 1776, after our misfortune on Lake Champlain, when an attack on Ticonderoga was daily apprehended) to occupy that height with artil|lery, but was judged to be impracticable. This hill had &s;uch an entire command of Ticonderoga, that the enemy might have counted our very numbers, and enfiladed every part of our works. After po&s;&s;e&s;ing them|&s;elves of this commanding height, it would have required but a few hours more to inve&s;t us on all &s;ides. This might have been effected by only occupying the ground on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Lake Champlain below Mount Independence, where the pa&s;s from the Lake to Ea&s;t Creek is very narrow. Had this taken place, our com|munication with the country had been at an end, no further &s;upplies of provi&s;ion or men could have reached us, nor would a retreat, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, then been practicable. But before this was effected, it was de|termined in a Council of War to retire from Ticonderoga and Mount Independence. This re&s;olution was entered into on the evening of the 5th of July, and very early in the morning of the 6th the troops left the ground. Mea&s;ures for the evacuation were concerted with the greate&s;t &s;ecrecy, to keep the enemy ignorant of our de&s;igns. The centinels within the works were ordered to challenge no per&s;on that night. This order I carried my&s;elf to the guards on Ticonderoga, though I was ignorant of the rea&s;on of &s;uch an order. The guns at the French lines were &s;piked; but, to amu&s;e the enemy, the Jer&s;ey battery kept up a regular fire during the night. The General al&s;o &s;ent me to the old French redoubt, which commanded the bridge between Ticonderoga and the Mount, to order the officer commanding the artillery there not to &s;pike the guns in that redoubt until further orders, as this redoubt might have been of &s;ervice in covering our troops on their pa&s;&s;age acro&s;s the bridge; but I found that through &s;ome mi&s;take tho&s;e guns had already been &s;piked. What &s;tores it was po&s;&s;ible to remove in the cour&s;e of one night, or rather in the &s;pace of a few hours, were put on board the ve&s;&s;els and batteaus in Lake Champlain, and &s;ent for Skeen&s;borough under Colonel Long, with the invalids and &s;ick of the ho&s;pital. Many barrels of powder, in particular, I remember were taken from the magazine, and put on board the ve&s;&s;els, though they afterwards fell into the enemy's hands, or were blown up. The remainder of the army, under General St. Clair him&s;elf, retired by land. The rear guard was under the command of Colonel Francis. The army the fir&s;t day reached Ca&s;tle-Town, about thirty miles from Mount Independence. We made a halt of between one and two hours at Hubbarton, twenty odd miles from the &s;ame place. Before our leaving that town, the General ordered the rear guard to halt a mile or two &s;hort of Ca&s;tle-Town, where he intended to &s;tay with the army that night. The General had no rea&s;on to doubt but the&s;e orders would have been attended to, and therefore was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed to find early the next morning that the rear guard was &s;till at Hubbarton, which is &s;ix miles di&s;tant from Ca&s;tle-Town. At this di&s;tance from the army, they were attacked by General Frazer's corps. The rear guard was increa&s;ed by many who at fir&s;t did not belong to it. This was owing to the exce&s;&s;ive bad roads and very heavy march|ing, which prevented many, who were more feeble than others, from keeping pace with their regiments. The&s;e were picked up by the rear guard, agreeable to orders. At the time of the engagement, I imagine it could not amount to le&s;s than 1000 men. The moment the firing was heard at Ca&s;tle-Town, the General determined to &s;upport the rear guard at Hubbarton. The troops at Ca&s;tle-Town were already under arms, and ready to march when the firing was fir&s;t heard. They were then ordered to keep their ground, and Major Dunn and my&s;elf were di&s;patched with orders from the General to Colonel Bellows, who lay with his and another militia regiment between Ca&s;tle-Town and Hubbarton. Our orders were to direct Colonel Bellows to march with tho&s;e two regiments immediately to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Colonel Francis, and to a&s;&s;ure Colonel Bel|lows at the &s;ame time that they &s;hould be farther &s;upported, if nece&s;&s;ary. In riding towards Hubbarton we were met by the&s;e regiments which were marching with &s;peed towards Ca&s;tle-Town. We delivered our orders, but could not prevail upon either regiment to reinforce the rear guard; though, in ju&s;tice to Colonel Bellows, it mu&s;t be &s;aid, he was in the rear of the regiment, and warmly per&s;uaded them to go to the field of action. an unaccountable panic had &s;eized his men, and no commands or intreaties had any effect on them. Finding it impo&s;&s;ible to turn the&s;e regiments to this nece&s;&s;ary piece of &s;ervice, we rode on towards the &s;eene of action, to find how matters were &s;ituated there, and report to the General; but we had not proceeded far before we were met by Capt. Chadwick, with about 30 men. Capt. Chadwick had ju&s;t left the field, and informed us that the action was at an end, that our men were di&s;per&s;ed, that the communication between us and Hubbarton was cut on, &s;o that we &s;hould run the greate&s;t ri&s;que of being made pri&s;oners if we proceeded any further that way, and that the enemy were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the field of battle, in great force. The firing (which had heen very &s;mart) having cea&s;ed, countenanced this intelligence, and we returned to Ca&s;tle-Town and ap|prized the General of it. General St. Clair now thought it unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;end any further reinforcement to Hubbarton, and prepared to pur&s;ue his march. But here I mu&s;t not forget to mention the conduct of the General towards two ea&s;tern regiments of militia, commanded, I believe, by Hale and Learned. The&s;e regiments had &s;hewed much di&s;centent on the march the preceding day, and began now to be very cla|morous to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. The General, apprized of this &s;pirit of di&s;content in the&s;e regiments, ordered them to be paraded at Ca&s;tle-Town, on the morning of the action at Hubbarton, and addre&s;&s;ed them in per&s;on. He &s;poke on this occa&s;ion in &s;o forcible and pathetic a manner, that the regiments, a&s;hamed of their con|duct, con&s;ented to remain with the army as long as there was any pro&s;pect of immediate danger from the enemy; but the plundering di&s;po&s;ition they di&s;covered on the march, and their other di&s;orderly behaviour, obliged the General a day or two afterwards to di&s;mi&s;s them from the army with di&s;grace. The army after this continued their route through &s;everal towns, ea&s;t of Ca&s;tle-Town, without any further interruption from the enemy, to Hud&s;on's River. I am very well per&s;waded that it was General St. Clair's intention at fir&s;t to have marched by Skeen&s;borough to Fort Edward; but an officer of one of our gallies on the Lake arrived
<PB N="38" REF="016141_0037_0F9C7A7926E0D1E0">
at Ca&s;tle-Town before we left it, and informed the General that the enemy were pur&s;uing in force that way, who would reach Skeen&s;borough before he could po&s;&s;ibly get there, and that &s;ome ve&s;&s;els had already fallen into their power. This determined the General to change his intended route, and take the road he after|wards did. Before we reached Hud&s;on's River, General St. Clair di&s;patched me to inform General Schuyler of the &s;ituation of his army. So far as I had an opportunity of ob&s;erving General St. Clair's conduct, it reflects high honour on him. Previous to, during the &s;iege, and on the retreat, he gave proofs of his atten|tion, activity and courage. The garri&s;on were always under arms at their proper po&s;ts before &s;un-ri&s;e, and frequently before day-break. The General was always out on the&s;e occa&s;ions him&s;elf, and was an example of vigilance to the &s;oldiery. I do not remember, tho' I lived in the &s;ame quarters with him the greater part of the time during the &s;iege, that he ever undre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf at night. All night, indeed, he would &s;carcely ever permit him&s;elf to &s;leep. If he did, it was not above an hour or two, tho' the gentlemen about him would frequently ob&s;erve that he would certainly injure his health unle&s;s he indulged him&s;elf with more &s;leep. In ca&s;e of alarms, which were very frequent, he always appeared at the lines, encouraging the &s;oldiery by his pre&s;ence and exhortations. On the retreat, he pre&s;erved as much order in the army as was po&s;&s;ible thro' &s;uch bad roads, and &s;o rough a country.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know the time General St. Clair received information of the &s;trength and de&s;igns of the enemy?</P>
<P>A. I do not.</P>
<P>Major General St. Clair, having concluded the te&s;timony in his behalf, de&s;ires the Court to give him time to make his defence.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear General,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I GOT to this place ye&s;terday, having met with nothing on the communication nece&s;&s;ary to inform you of, except that at Fort-Edward there is neither beef nor pork, but what it brought from hence. It &s;eems to me a very extraordinary proceedure, to be tran&s;porting provi&s;ion from Fort Edward to the Lake, and then bringing it back for the u&s;e of that garri&s;on, and mu&s;t ari&s;e from the greate&s;t inattention in the Commi&s;&s;ary. The commanding officer informs me he wrote repeatedly to Mr. Avery about this matter, and that this is the third time he has been in the &s;ame predicament.</P>
<P>A con&s;iderable quantity of provi&s;ions are &s;till here, which are getting over as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. I believe they will be all over before we &s;ee the enemy, who, by General Poor's letters, are making no motions that indicate a &s;udden approach.</P>
<P>General de Fermoy pre&s;ents his compliments, and begs you would &s;end him a German, of the name of Chapman, he took out of goal in Albany. He wants him for &s;ome particular purpo&s;e, for which he thinks he can depend upon him; but if you are &s;u&s;picious of him, that you would order him up with a file of men.</P>

<P>MY &s;cout, on which I depended much for intelligence, is not yet returned, nor I fear ever will now. It con&s;i&s;ted of three men only, the be&s;t of Whitcomb's people, and picked out by him for the purpo&s;e. The woods are &s;o full of Indians that it is difficult for parties to get through. I &s;hall &s;end off Whitcomb him&s;elf pre&s;ently, for intelligence I mu&s;t have, altho' I am very loth to put him upon it, left he &s;hould fall into the hands of the enemy, who have no &s;mall de&s;ire to have him in their power.</P>
<P>I &s;ent Colonel Warner to the Grants ye&s;terday, to rai&s;e a body of men to oppo&s;e the incur&s;ions of the &s;a|vages that are gone by Otter-Creek, and have ordered him to attack them, and join me again as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. I am very happy to find the country was apprized of the march of that party before Colonel War|ner got to Skeen&s;borough, as it will probably prevent their &s;ucce&s;s, and may end in their ruin.</P>
<P>We are going on with the nece&s;&s;ary works on the Mount as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, and have removed the mo&s;t valuable of the &s;tores and provi&s;ion to that &s;ide. The bridge is in very little more forwardne&s;s to appearance than when you left this place, but they tell me this day will fini&s;h the getting timber for it. The boom is likewi&s;e placed, but very feebly &s;ecured, for want of cables.</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h the batteaus were all over &s;oon, or that you would not &s;end them. I am extremely appre|hen&s;ive the enemy will po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the Landing, in which ca&s;e they might fall into their hands. We cannot venture the teams now without a &s;trong guard, and &s;o many parties as we are obliged to make, with the fatigues, will very &s;oon wear down our men.</P>
<P>We can do nothing but form conjectures about the force of the enemy, for I cannot find a &s;ingle per&s;on, on whom I can depend, to venture among&s;t them for intelligence; but, from their manner of beginning the campaign, I conclude that they are either in full force, or very weak, and hope by letting loo&s;e the Indians

<P>Major General St. Clair, being reque&s;ted to make his defence, &s;ays as follows:</P>
<P>HOWEVER di&s;agreeable it may be to appear before a Court, a pri&s;oner, and in the light of a cri|minal, I am happy that my conduct, which has been &s;o much cen&s;ured at large, is at la&s;t to be enquired into by a proper judicatory, and that, after &s;o long a delay, and &s;o injurious a di&s;crimination, public ju&s;tice will be done upon a full, an impartial, and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate examination, and that it will be pa&s;&s;ed upon by men equal to the ta&s;k of inve&s;tigating the truth, however artfully concealed, and determining upon the intrin&s;ic merit of military actions, &s;tripped of the glare that is &s;ometimes thrown upon them by &s;ucce&s;s, or the fal&s;e lights in which they are often placed by con&s;equences. If I am guilty of all, or any of the charges again&s;t me, I wi&s;h not to e&s;cape puni&s;hment; but, con&s;cious of no crime, I hope by your &s;entence, upon a candid compari&s;on of the te&s;timony, to have tho&s;e &s;tains wiped from my character, with which it has been &s;uffered to remain too long blotted, and to be re&s;tored with honour to the arms of my friends and of my country. I &s;ay a proper judicatory, in contra-di&s;tinction to that before which the matter has been &s;o long hung up, and which, from the proceedings, &s;eems to have con&s;idered it&s;elf as analogous to a grand-jury, and has &s;trictly followed the ill example of grand juries in latter times; I mean their calling for, or admitting, &s;uch evidence only as might &s;erve to criminate, not con&s;idering how much the bare accu&s;ation affects the reputation, or, where the per&s;on has any &s;en&s;ibility, how deeply it cuts into the &s;oul.</P>
<P>The in&s;tances of di&s;crimination are &s;o many, it is painful to mention them. But has it not taken place in the ca&s;es of General Sullivan. General Wayne, General Maxwell, General Putnam, and others? They have all been accu&s;ed of mi&s;conduct, but General Schuyler and my&s;elf only have been forced to langui&s;h, in torpid inactivity, under the weight of the accu&s;ation.</P>
<P>The charges again&s;t me are of a very general and criminal nature, and have been &s;tated by a Committee of Congre&s;s, upon the evidence collected by another Committee, appointed for the purpo&s;e of collecting evidence again&s;t the General Officers, who were in the northern department when Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were evacuated. Sir, all this formal interference of Congre&s;s, or Committees of Congre&s;s, gives the matter an air of va&s;t importance, and impre&s;&s;es on the public an idea of great criminality. It will, therefore, be nece&s;&s;ary for me, whil&s;t I defend my&s;elf again&s;t the charges directly, to take &s;ome notice of the rea&s;onings of the Committee, and to &s;hew in &s;ome in&s;tances their fallacy, in others their futility. For which rea&s;on I beg leave to read the report.</P>

<P>That, on or about the 13th day of June, 1777, Major General St. Clair took upon him the command at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, and that tho&s;e po&s;ts were, by his orders, evacuated to the enemy on the 6th day of July following.</P>
<P>That, by Deputy Commi&s;&s;ary Avery's return of provi&s;ion at Ticonderoga on the 25th of May, 1777, there were at that po&s;t 1400 barrels of flour, and 661 barrels of beef; which he &s;tated as &s;ufficient provi&s;ion in flour for 4000 men during 66 days, and in beef for 75 days.</P>
<P>That, by Deputy Commi&s;&s;ary Yancey's return of provi&s;ion remaining on hand at Ticonderoga the 20th of June, 1777, there were 2015 barrels of flour, 195 barrels of beef, 784 barrels of pork, and 48 barrels of hard bread, be&s;ides pea&s;e, Indian meal, &s;ugar, coffee, chocolate, mola&s;&s;es, wine, rum, &s;alt, candles and hog's-lard.</P>

<P>That General St. Clair informed the Council of War held on the 5th of July, 1777, that 900 militia had joined him. That Je&s;&s;e Leavenworth &s;wears they were of the Grants; and General St. Clair, in his letter to Congre&s;s, July 14, &s;ays they joined on the 5th. That the whole force in Ticonderoga, on the 5th of July, 1777, was 5639 men and officers, of which a number, not exceeding 639, could be con&s;idered as &s;ick.</P>
<P>That, on the 13th of June, 1777, General St. Clair wrote to General Schuyler, the commanding officer in the department, that two men from Canada, taken pri&s;oners, informed him that the Briti&s;h army in Ca|nada were a&s;&s;embling, to the amount of about 10,000 men, as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, to cro&s;s the Lake, and attack Ticonderoga; and that he might depend upon it their fleet would appear in a fortnight at farthe&s;t.</P>
<P>That, on the 18th of June, General St. Clair wrote to General Schuyler, that four of the enemy's ve&s;&s;els were lying within a mile of the hither &s;ide of <HI>Split-Rock</HI>; that on the day before the enemy's Indians had taken two pri&s;oners, who had &s;trolled from his camp unarmed; and that he thought the enemy's main army was not far off.</P>
<P>That, on the 14th of June, General St. Clair wrote to General Schuyler, that the evening before he had received information, from a &s;couting party, the enemy were encamped on both &s;ides of Gilliland's Creek, and that they were very numerous.</P>
<P>That, on the 25th of June, General St. Clair wrote to Congre&s;s, that he was not able to di&s;cover whether the enemy were in force or not; that &s;even of their ve&s;&s;els arrived at Crown-Point the preceding evening; and that others of their fleet were four or five miles lower down.</P>
<P>That, on the 30th of June, General St. Clair wrote to General Schuyler, that the enemy having advanced to the Three Mile Point, the alarm was given; that his people were in the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ition po&s;&s;ible; and that he had no doubt of giving a good account of the enemy, &s;hould they think proper to attack him.</P>
<P>That it does not appear the enemy did attack General St. Clair; yet, neverthele&s;s, on the 5th of July he called a Council of War, and de&s;ired their opinion, whether he &s;hould wait the attack at the Ticonderoga lines, or whether the whole of the troops &s;hould be drawn over to Mount Independence, the more effectually to provide for the defence of that po&s;t. Whereupon the Council were unanimou&s;ly of opinion, that it was impo&s;&s;ible, with their force (then &s;tated by General St. Clair to be 2089 rank and file, be&s;ides the corps of artillery, 900 militia, and 124 artificers unarmed) to defend Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, and that the troops, cannon and &s;tores &s;hould be removed that night, if po&s;&s;ible, to Mount Independence. That the General al&s;o put another que&s;tion, whether, after a retreat to Mount Independence, they &s;hould be in a &s;itua|tion defend that po&s;t? or, in ca&s;e it could not be defended, whether a retreat into the country would be practicable? Upon the&s;e points, the Council unanimou&s;ly concluded that a retreat ought to be undertaken as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and that they &s;hould be very fortunate if it could be effected. And in pur&s;uance of this determination Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were abandoned between two and three o'clock in the morning of the 6th of July, 1777, General St. Clair having, as appears by Je&s;&s;e Leavenworth's affidavit, eight days before &s;ent his &s;on and baggage from Ticonderoga to Fort George.</P>
<P>That General St. Clair, in his letter to the Hon. John Jay, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> dated July 25, 1777. writing of the evacuation of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, &s;ays, That had the opinion of the Council been con|trary to what it was, it (meaning the evacuation) would neverthele&s;s have taken place, as he knew it to be impo&s;&s;ible to defend the po&s;ts with their numbers.</P>
<P>That the &s;ick at Ticonderoga, and the public &s;tores of ammunition, cannon, provi&s;ion and cloathing, were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> behind, or lo&s;t upon the precipitate retreat of the 6th of July.</P>
<P>That on the 20th of June, 1777. a Council of War was held at Ticonderoga, Generals Schuyler and St. Clair being pre&s;ent, wherein it was determined, that Ticonderoga and Mount Independence ought to be main|tained as long as po&s;&s;ible, con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;afety of the troops and <HI>&s;tores</HI>; that, if either of tho&s;e po&s;ts mu&s;t be evacuated, the former &s;hould be evacuated; that the fortifications and lines on Mount Independence were very deficient; and that repairing the old and adding new works ought to claim immediate attention.</P>
<P>That, by Je&s;&s;e Leavenworth's affidavit, it appears there was not a &s;troke &s;truck to fortify Mount Independ|ence; that no parties were &s;ent to annoy the enemy, though the troops were healthy, courageous, and de&s;irous to improve every advantage again&s;t them.</P>
<P>That, by the determination of the Council of War on the 5th of July, it appears the enemy had then nothing more to do to compleat their inve&s;titure of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, than to occupy the neck of land, a &s;pace of three quarters of a mile between the Lake and the Ea&s;t Creek, and to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the Narrow, between them and Skeen&s;borough.</P>

<P>A picket guard, of 1 Captain, 3 Subalterns, 3 Serjeants, 3 Corporals, and 50 Privates, po&s;ted to the right of the French lines.</P>
<P>For fatigue, 3 Captains, 10 Subalterns, 10 Serjeants, 5 Drums and Fifes, 326 Rank and File. The whole to continue till farther orders. Total privates for guards, 178; for fatigue, 326.</P>
<P>That, on the 23d of June, the abovementioned guards were reduced from 178 to 95 men; the fatigue party from 326 to 250 men; and 78 privates, under proper officers, were ordered for the detail of guards at Mount Independence; all to continue till further orders.</P>
<P>That the 26th of June was the fir&s;t day the troops were drawn up at their alarm-po&s;ts, ordered to di&s;charge their loaded pieces, and to clean them; and it was but on this day that a &s;ignal was given in orders, in ca&s;e of an attack at the French lines, or at Mount Independence.</P>
<P>That, on the 29th of June, it was ordered that a &s;cout, con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;ubaltern, a &s;erjeant, and twenty privates, &s;hould be &s;ent out every morning, one hour before gun-fire; the fatigue party being then increa&s;ed to 310 privates, the other guards continuing as before, 173 privates, without any addition till the evacu|ation of the po&s;ts.</P>
<P>Upon which &s;tate of evidence, your Committee, in order to ground their charges again&s;t Major General St. Clair, beg leave to remark;</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> That, on the 13th of June, General St. Clair was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an information, from two pri&s;oners taken in Canada, that the Briti&s;h forces, amounting to about 10,000 men, were proceeding as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible again&s;t him, and that he might expect their arrival in three weeks at farthe&s;t. That as, on the 18th of June, four of the enemy's ve&s;&s;els were lying on the hither &s;ide of Split-Rock, and on the 24th &s;even of them were at Crown Point, and others four or five miles lower down, their forces then encamped on both &s;ides of Gilli|land's Creek, and he was informed by his &s;couts that they were very numerous; &s;o from the&s;e circum&s;tances it appears General St. Clair had &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;on to confide in what the pri&s;oners had told him relative to the intentions and &s;trength of the enemy, and that he ought at this time to have taken his final re&s;olution, either to &s;tand an attack, or to retreat with his &s;tores, the pre&s;ervation of which was a principal object in the determi|nations of the Council of War on the 20th of June. Therefore it appears that General St. Clair's neglecting to form his deci&s;ive opinion at this time, or at a later day, &s;o as to allow him a &s;ufficient opportunity to retreat with his troops, &s;ick, ammunition, cannon, provi&s;ion and cloathing, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> deprive the enemy of &s;helter at Ticonderoga, was a neglect of duty.</P>
<P><HI>Second.</HI> That General St. Clair, on the 24th of June, was informed by his &s;couts the enemy were very numerous, and yet, neverthele&s;s, on the next day he wrote to Congre&s;s, that he was not able to di&s;cover whether the enemy were in force or not.</P>
<P><HI>Third.</HI> That it General St. Clair found &s;mall &s;couts could not acquire a knowledge whether the enemy were in force or not, it was his duty in due time to have &s;ent out reconnoitring parties, in &s;uch force as might have a&s;&s;ured him whether or not the enemy were in &s;trength, this being a mo&s;t important point, as upon this he was to regulate his motions; and therefore his failure in &s;ending out &s;uch parties in due time was a neglect, of duty.</P>
<P><HI>Fourth.</HI> That as Je&s;&s;e Leavenworth &s;wears General St. Clair did not annoy the enemy in their advance again&s;t, and inve&s;titure of, the po&s;ts under his care, although the troops were healthy, courageous, and de&s;i|rous of action, it appears the General did not to the utmo&s;t of his power oppo&s;e the operations of the enemy; and therefore that he is liable to the charge of neglect of duty, of cowardice, or of treachery, or of incapacity as a General.</P>
<P><HI>Fifth.</HI> That as it was determined in the Council of War on the 20th of June, approved by General Schuyler, the commanding officer in the department, that the repairing the old and adding new works on Mount Independence ought to claim immediate attention; and Je&s;&s;e Leavenworth &s;wears not a &s;troke was &s;truck for tho&s;e purpo&s;es; and by the orderly book it appears the fatigue party was decrea&s;ed in number, and &s;o continued at a time when it &s;hould have been abundantly increa&s;ed; &s;o on the&s;e points the General is liable to be charged with a neglect of duty, amounting to a breach of orders, and with treachery.</P>
<P><HI>Sixth.</HI> That as on the 25th of May, the Deputy Commi&s;&s;ary rated that 1400 barrels of flour would, at an allowance of one pound each man <HI>per diem,</HI> &s;erve 4000 men 66 days, and that 661 barrels of beef would &s;erve the &s;ame number of men 75 days; and &s;uppo&s;ing that, from the twentieth of June to the fourth of July inclu&s;ive, there were in Ticonderoga and Mount Independence 4739 men, and there does not appear to have been at any time between tho&s;e periods a greater number; &s;o, e&s;timating the con&s;umption of 4739 men, from the twentieth of June to the fourth of July inclu&s;ive, upon the 2015 barrels of flour, 195 barrels of beef, and 784 barrels of pork, on the twentieth of June returned by Deputy Commi&s;&s;ary Yancey as then actually remaining on hand, there did on the fourth of July remain, or ought, if provi&s;ions had been regularly and properly i&s;&s;ued, to be then remaining 1625 barrels of flour, 3 barrels of beef, and 784 barrels of pork; a magazine of provi&s;ions &s;ufficient to afford to the army on the 5th of July, amounting, by the arrival of the militia of the Grants, to 5639 men of all ranks, <HI>full allowance</HI> of provi&s;ion in flour for 52 days, and in beef and pork for 32 days, exclu&s;ive of the con&s;iderable number of fat cattle that arrived at Ticonderoga on the fifth of July, the teams of oxen nece&s;&s;arily attending the po&s;t, and other &s;tores &s;pecified in the Commi&s;&s;ary's return on the twentieth of June, and even &s;uppo&s;ing, as may not rea&s;onably be done, that no &s;upply of flour had arrived after that day. And as this calculation has been liberally made, upon the quantity of provi&s;ion
<PB N="42" REF="016141_0041_0F9C8035A59B1340">
actually in Ticondero on the twentieth of June, for the expenditure of which General St. Clair, at com|mander at the po&s;t, ought to be held re&s;pon&s;ible; therefore it clearly appears Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were not abandoned upon a ju&s;t principle of a want of provi&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Seventh.</HI> That as General St. Clair informed the Hon. Mr. Jay, that at the time of holding the Council of War on the 5th of July, he knew it to be impo&s;&s;ible to defend the po&s;ts with his numbers, it is natural to conclude he was decided upon this point at early at the 29th of June, the day that he &s;ent his &s;on and pri|vate effects from Ticonderoga to Fort-George, as a place of &s;afety: That being decided upon this point, it was his duty then to have taken at effectual mea&s;ures for the pre&s;ervation of the public property, at lea&s;t equally with his own, claiming his earlie&s;t attention: That on the 30th of June, the enemy being ad|vanced again&s;t him &s;o near as the Three Mile Point, it is incredible that he did not then know that they were in force: That it was his duty, <HI>at that point of time,</HI> to have finally determined either to abide the operations of the enemy, or to retire: That if the la&s;t re&s;olution was taken, and, from his &s;ending off his &s;on and baggage the day before, there is the &s;tronge&s;t pre&s;umption that this re&s;olution was <HI>then</HI> fully taken, it was his duty then to have proceeded to &s;end off the public &s;tores, to de&s;troy the works, and to evacuate the po&s;ts without lo&s;ing a moment of time: And that by deferring to take any mea&s;ures to retire till the la&s;t moment when he could po&s;&s;ibly retreat oven with his effective troops, a moment when the &s;ick, ammunition, cannon, provi&s;ion and cloathing of the army mu&s;t be abandoned and lo&s;t, be&s;ides the lives of many men in effecting a retreat from before an enemy immediately upon him, General St. Clair appears chargeable with inattention to the progre&s;s of the enemy, with treachery, or with incapacity as a General, and with &s;hamefully abandoning the po&s;ts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, in his charge. Nor can the proving, as General St. Clair wi&s;hes to do, that the works of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were too exten&s;ive, and that the troops were very badly armed, if &s;uch things can be proved, fail of placing General St. Clair in a more reprehen&s;ible point of view, at the weakne&s;s of his defence being more obvious, his retreat &s;hould have been earlier de|termined upon and made.</P>
<P>Your Committee, having thus &s;tated the points principally re&s;ulting from the evidence collected again&s;t General St. Clair, recommend that a general court-martial be ordered to fit for the trial of Major General St. Clair, for the lo&s;s of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, with the public &s;tores; and that he be charged</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t. With Neglect of Duty</HI>; under the 5th article of the 18th &s;ection of the rules and articles of war&mdash; and that the charge be founded upon the fir&s;t, third, fourth and fifth Remarks, re&s;pectively.</P>
<P><HI>Second. With Cowardice, with Treachery, with Incapacity as a General,</HI> re&s;pectively; under the 5th article of the 18th &s;ection of the rules and articles of war&mdash;and that the charge be founded upon the fourth remark.</P>
<P><HI>Third. With Treachery</HI>; under the 5th article of the 18th &s;ection of the rules and articles of war&mdash; and that the charge be founded upon the fifth remark.</P>
<P><HI>Fourth. With inattention to the Progre&s;s of the enemy, with Treachery, with Incapacity as a General,</HI> re&s;pec|tively; under the 5th article of the 18th &s;ection of the rules and articles of war&mdash;and that the charge be founded upon the &s;eventh remark.</P>
<P><HI>Fifth. With &s;hamefully abandoning the Po&s;ts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, in his charge</HI>; under the 12th article of the 13th &s;ection of the rules and articles of war&mdash;and that the charge be founded upon the &s;eventh remark.</P>
<P>Finally, upon the ca&s;e of Major General St. Clair, your Committee recommend that authenticated copies of the returns, letters, and determinations of courts-martial, referred to, be tran&s;mitted to the Judge-Advocate-General; that Eli&s;ha Avery, James Yancey, Richard Varrick, Je&s;&s;e Leavenworth, and the Colonels com|manding the two battalions of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts militia, who&s;e time of &s;ervice was nearly expired at the evacuation of Ticonderoga, be &s;ummoned to give evidence at the trial of Major General St. Clair; and that he be fur|ni&s;hed with a copy of the remarks and charges again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t ob&s;ervation that naturally offers is, that the charges which have been exhibited to this Court have all been founded upon the <HI>ex parte</HI> affidavit of a Mr. Leavenworth, which (in mo&s;t in&s;tances) he has contra|dicted in open Court, and con&s;equently is entitled to no degree of credit, and upon my own letters to Congre&s;s and to General Schuyler, the Officer who commanded in chief in the northern department. It is &s;ingular, however, that charges of &s;o high a nature again&s;t an officer of my rank &s;hould be attempted to be &s;upported (for &s;upported I tru&s;t they are not) by no other living witne&s;s than Mr. Leavenworth, a private man! a fol|lower of the army! in &s;ome of the lowe&s;t and vile&s;t occupations! who, if he had had capacity to judge, could not po&s;&s;ibly have had proper information; that not an officer, of any rank what&s;oever, has been called upon; and yet, had treachery, had neglect of duty, been committed,&mdash;had I been inattentive to the progre&s;s of the enemy,&mdash;had the po&s;ts in my charge been &s;hamefully abandoned,&mdash;or had I been guilty of cowardice,&mdash;they could not have e&s;caped their notice altogether; nay, it was by them only they could probably hate been di&s;|covered. But this by the bye. Previous to any remarks upon, or application of, the te&s;timony, I beg leave to inform the Court, that, before I left Philadelphia to take upon me the command of Ticonderoga, Congre&s;s had received information, which they credited, that the principal part of the enemy's troops in Canada were ordered round by St. Lawrence to join General Howe; that no &s;erious attempt would be made upon Ticon|deroga; at mo&s;t, it would be a diver&s;ion only. This was communicated to me by Mr. Hancock, then Pre|&s;ident, and I have his authority to mention it to this Court. This circum&s;tance will &s;erve as a key to many of my letters, and will account for my doubts about &s;ome intelligence I received after my arrival at Ticonde|roga. And it appears from General Poor's te&s;timony, that General Gates had likewi&s;e, from them, received the &s;ame account.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t charge is neglect of duty, founded upon the fir&s;t, third, fourth and fifth remarks, re&s;pectively.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t remark is, "that on the 13th of June I was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an information, from two pri&s;oners taken in Canada, that the Briti&s;h forces, amounting to about 10,000 men, were proceeding as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible again&s;t me, and that I might expect their arrival in three weeks at farthe&s;t; that as, on the 18th of June, four of the enemy's ve&s;&s;els were lying on the hither &s;ide of Split Rock, and, on the 24th, &s;even of them were at Crown-Point, and others four or five miles lower down, their forces then encamped on both &s;ides Gilliland's Creek,

and that I was informed by my &s;couts they were very numerous; &s;o, from the&s;e circum&s;tances, it appears I had &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;on to confide in what the pri&s;oners had told me relative to the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and &s;trength of the enemy, and that I ought at this time to have taken my final re&s;olution either to &s;tand an attack, or to retreat with my &s;tores, the pre&s;ervation of which was a principal object in the determinations of the Council of War on the 20th; therefore it appears, that neglecting to form my deci&s;ive opinion at this time, or at a later day, &s;o as to allow my&s;elf a &s;ufficient opportunity to retreat with my troops, &s;ick, ammunition, cannon, provi&s;ion and cloathing, and to deprive the enemy of &s;helter at Ticonderoga, was a neglect of duty."</P>
<P>It is true, that on the 13th of June I was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an information, from two pri&s;oners, that the Briti&s;h army amounted to about 10,000 men, and that they were making every preparation to cro&s;s the Lake, to attack my po&s;ts; but it is al&s;o true, that I con&s;idered the&s;e per&s;ons as &s;pies; that their information was con|tradicted by two Frenchmen, who had been &s;ent into Canada by General Gates, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of gaining intelligence of the enemy's de&s;igns; that the information of the&s;e Frenchmen arrived at the &s;ame time, and was tran&s;mitted by the &s;ame conveyance to General Schuyler; as appears from my letter to him of June 13th.</P>
<P>The information, Sir, of pri&s;oners is generally doubtful; but that of per&s;ons con&s;idered as &s;pies mu&s;t al|ways be &s;u&s;pected. I would therefore have been ju&s;tifiable in not giving them credit, if I had not received contradictory intelligence. But when the Court con&s;ider the opinion of Congre&s;s above-mentioned, and that the per&s;ons actually were &s;pies (the letter from Mr. Livius to General Sullivan, that has been publi&s;hed by the General, having been found upon one of them) and that their intelligence was contradicted by per&s;ons of credit, they will think the conclu&s;ion I drew the natural and proper one&mdash;that they were &s;ent to deceive us, and were unworthy of belief. They will think that the enemy's advancing their ve&s;&s;els to Crown-Point and Split Rock, and forming an encampment at Gilliland's Creek, as they did on the 18th and 24th of June (that place being at a di&s;tance, out of the reach of our parties, but not out of the way of ob&s;ervation) thereby to induce the divi&s;ion of our troops, to reinforce the places on which they had no de&s;ign, and to le&s;&s;en the op|po&s;ition where their army was to act effectually, was the very thing they ought to have done; and we all know the appearance of a great encampment can be made with very few troops. And this &s;entiment at cofor|tified by the po&s;ition of their camp, which was a &s;andy beach upon the &s;hore of the Lake, where the creek falls into it, forty-two or three miles di&s;tant from Ticonderoga, as has been proven by General Wilkin&s;on, Major Dunn, and others, with a rough, broken, woody country betwixt them.</P>
<P>But it &s;eems I ought then, or at a later day, to have taken my deci&s;ive re&s;olution to retreat, &s;aving to my|&s;elf a &s;ufficient opportunity to bring off my troops, and every thing that was at the po&s;ts, and to deprive the enemy of &s;helter at Ticonderoga, and that the not doing &s;o was a neglect of duty.</P>
<P>I &s;u&s;pect, Sir, the Committee, who formed the&s;e charges, had no idea of the nature of a &s;ubordinate com|mand. They would otherwi&s;e have known, that I had no power to form or execute any &s;uch re&s;olution, and that my ju&s;tification for evacuating the po&s;ts at all mu&s;t depend upon the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e. I did what my duty required me. I gave the earlie&s;t notice to the Commanding Officer of the department, and &s;tood ready to execute his commands. But I am per&s;waded that, had it been in my power to have taken my final re&s;olu|tion then, and upon the intelligence I had received I had abandoned the po&s;ts, altho' every thing had been &s;aved which has &s;ince been lo&s;t, the charges of treachery and cowardice would have been rung much louder, and pre&s;&s;ed home more &s;trongly, and with more virulence, if po&s;&s;ible, than in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. I &s;hould have heard, that no deci&s;ive operation &s;hould be founded on the vague report of pri&s;oners or de&s;erters, often ignorant, almo&s;t always ill informed; but that to abandon a po&s;t on the information of per&s;ons I &s;u&s;pected to be, and actually were, the enemy's &s;pies, or from the view of an encampment upwards of forty miles off, and that only &s;een acro&s;s a lake &s;ix or eight miles broad, could proceed from no other than one of tho&s;e &s;ources, or from perfect &s;tupidity; and this Court, from whom I expect a very different deci&s;ion, would have joined in that opinion, and condemned me to the puni&s;hment I had ju&s;tly merited. But, be&s;ides all this, if the Council of War was to guide, it was out of my power to take any &s;uch mea&s;ure; for the re&s;olution of the Council is, that both Ticonderoga and Mount Independence are to be held as long as they can be, con|&s;i&s;tent with the &s;afety of the troops and &s;tores. When the &s;afety of the troops and &s;tores became doubtful, Ticonderoga, not Mount Independence, was to be evacuated.</P>
<P>The &s;econd article upon which the charge of neglect of duty is founded is, "That if I found &s;mall &s;couts could not acquire a knowledge whether the enemy were in force or not, it was my duty, in due time, to have &s;ent out reconnoitring parties, in &s;uch force as might have a&s;&s;ured me whether or not the enemy were in &s;trength, and that this was not done."</P>
<P>Had not the Committee been totally ignorant of the nature of the country in which the&s;e parties were to act&mdash;had they given any attention to the returns of my army, which were before them, or credit to my letters to General Schuyler, of which they had the peru&s;al, this article would never have made its appearance. Had it ever occurred to them that the enemy proceeded by water, and that the only debarkation we hear of was at Gilliland's Creek, forty miles and upwards from Ticonderoga, and that they proceeded from thence by water again, we &s;hould not have heard this &s;tory of reconnoitering parties, of which, I am morally cer|tain they them&s;elves had no determinate idea. My whole army would not have formed one party &s;uch as they &s;eem to think ought to have been &s;ent out frequently. I have proven that &s;mall parties were &s;ent out, not only frequently but con&s;tantly; and altho' they were but &s;mall parties, they were as &s;trong as the &s;tate of my garri&s;on, and the works in hand, would allow. It is true, indeed, I obtained by them no certain intelli|gence of the enemy's force until they landed at Three Mile Point, nor was it po&s;&s;ible before; they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed neither the gifts of divination, nor walking upon the water; but they could give me information if any part of the enemy's army were advancing by land, and this was all I could expect from them, except that, in that ca&s;e, they might have brought off &s;ome pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The returns prove the &s;trength of my army&mdash;the orderly book the daily guards&mdash;and I have proven, by General Poor, Colonel Baldwin, Colonel Ko&s;eiu&s;zko, General Wilkin&s;on, and almo&s;t every witne&s;s, the nu|merous fatigue parties and pickets. I leave it to the Court to judge if larger parties could have been &s;pared to make di&s;coveries. But &s;uppo&s;ing, for argument &s;ake, that my army would have afforded &s;tronger reconnoitring parties, I contend that, until the enemy were landed, they would have been u&s;ele&s;s, and afterwards highly im|proper;
<PB N="44" REF="016141_0043_0F9C803728851F88">
and that the &s;ending &s;uch would have argued great want of Judgment. It would have been &s;ending two or three hundred men (and that number would perhaps have been thought a pretty good recon|noitring party) to certain de&s;truction. They could not have marched thro' thick woods and rank herbage without being di&s;covered, if the enemy's parties were the lea&s;t vigilant. If they were attacked at a di&s;tance, as they could not be &s;upported, they mu&s;t inevitably have fallen into the enemy's hands; if attacked within &s;upporting di&s;tance, they mu&s;t &s;till have fallen, or a general action been brought on; for they could no otherwi&s;e have been &s;upported, but by marching out to &s;u&s;tain them, and then all the expence and time that had been laid out on the fortifications were thrown away. A General, entru&s;ted with the defence of a po&s;t, who reduces him&s;elf to the nece&s;&s;ity of fighting the enemy to &s;upport his detachments, or who, by making large detachments and lo&s;ing them, puts it out of his own power to maintain his po&s;t, certainly di&s;covers very little knowledge, and would ju&s;tly be the object of cen&s;ure at lea&s;t, if not of puni&s;hment. Had &s;uch detachments been made from my army, one or other of the&s;e con&s;equences mu&s;t have followed; they mu&s;t have been when&punc; or I mu&s;t have ri&s;ked an action to bring them off: But I had not a force &s;ufficient for the defence of my po&s;ts, much le&s;s to cope with the enemy in the field, therefore no &s;uch detachments, as &s;hould lay me under the nece&s;&s;ity of attempting it, or be of any great moment if a misfortune happened to them, were made. But further, as very &s;mall parties, three men for example, can approach an enemy without much danger of being di&s;covered, which large parties cannot, and that the&s;e &s;mall parties, from that cir|cum&s;tance, have a better chance to make pri&s;oners, to take off a centinel for example, to which they are fully adequate, and that the intelligence to be obtained from reconnoitring parties mu&s;t depend, in a great mea&s;ure, upon the pri&s;oners they make, it follows that &s;mall parties are the mo&s;t proper, and fully an&s;wer every purpo&s;e of gaining intelligence that can be derived from the larger, without being &s;ubject to the &s;ame dangers. It likewi&s;e follows, that there was no neglect of duty in this in&s;tance, but, on the contrary, that the mo&s;t proper methods for obtaining certain intelligence of the motions and force of the enemy were taken and pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>The charge of neglect of duty is further grounded upon the affidavit of Mr. Leavenworth, who, the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;wears that the enemy were not annoyed by me in their advance again&s;t, and inve&s;titure of, the po&s;ts under my care, though the troops were healthy, courageous, and de&s;irous of action, and therefore I am liable to the charges of neglect of duty, of cowardice, or of treachery, or of incapacity as a General. The Committee &s;eem to be in doubt on which of the four to &s;ix, it is one or t'other, but, to make &s;ure of the matter, and &s;well the black li&s;t, they have directed that I be pro&s;ecuted upon each. It has been proven by Dr. Brown and Dr. Town&s;hend, the ho&s;pital &s;urgeons, that the troops were not healthy, and their te&s;timony will have weight. The Court will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve the contradiction betwixt what the Committee &s;ay Mr. Leavenworth &s;wore, and what he actually &s;wears before this Court; here he &s;wears that he has &s;een parties go out of about twenty men, and that he once heard of a &s;calp being brought in; there he &s;wore that they were not annoyed at all; perhaps he thought killing and &s;calping the &s;avages employed by the enemy no annoy|ance! But it is needle&s;s to dwell upon this man's te&s;timony, as, from his &s;tation, he could not know much, and, from his ob&s;ervation, he actually knows very little.</P>
<P>It is in proof to the Court, by a number of witne&s;&s;es, that parties were con&s;tantly out, and that they frequently were engaged with the enemy; and, by Colonel Stevens, that every annoyance was given to the enemy by the artillery, from every quarter, from the fir&s;t of their appearance until the evacuation. But if the Committee meant that no large detachments were &s;ent to annoy the enemy, it is granted; and the rea&s;ons that have been already given for not &s;ending out large reconnoitring parties apply &s;o directly, it would be tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing on the patience of the Court to repeat them.</P>
<P>The la&s;t ground for the charge of neglect of duty is, "that, notwith&s;tanding it had been determined in a Council of War on the 20th of June, that the repairing the old works, and adding new ones on Mount Independence ought to claim immediate attention, Mr. Leavenworth &s;wears not a &s;troke was &s;truck for the&s;e purpo&s;es." Here Mr. Leavenworth gives the Committee the &s;lip again; for he &s;wears before the Court, not that there was not a &s;troke &s;truck for the&s;e purpo&s;es, but that he has heard there were many &s;trokes &s;truck; he has heard of what he calls &s;ome &s;mall works flung up on the &s;outh end of Mount Independence; and it ap|pears by the map, and explanation by Colonel Ko&s;eiu&s;zko, the&s;e were lines and three redoubts, for 1500 men at lea&s;t. But, for&s;ooth, there were none erected where he expected, and <HI>he</HI> did not think the works &s;uitable to cover the men. He acknowledges he has &s;een parties of axe-men &s;ent from the parade. He could not &s;uppo&s;e they were &s;ent to &s;trike no &s;trokes; and it is &s;carce conceivable that a per&s;on, who on other occa&s;ions, as much out of his way, was &s;o very inqui&s;itive, &s;hould not have had the curio&s;ity to a&s;k &s;ome one what tho&s;e men were going to do with their axes, if his occupation as a &s;uttler had not given him an opportunity to know it.</P>
<P>The&s;e palpable contradictions betwixt the evidence this man has given to the Committee, and what he has declared to the Court, will, I hope, put a &s;top to all <HI>ex parte</HI> enquiries for the future; in which ca&s;e, I &s;hall the le&s;s regret the injuries I have my&s;elf &s;u&s;tained from them. But the Committee go on, and &s;ay, in further &s;upport of the charge, "that from the orderly book it appears the fatigue party was decrea&s;ed, and continued &s;o at a time when it ought to have been abundantly increa&s;ed." It is true the parties furni&s;hed by the daily details were decrea&s;ed; but I have proven, by a cloud of witne&s;&s;es, that circum&s;tance notwith&s;tand|ing, that the fatigue parties were abundantly increa&s;ed, and continued &s;o; nay, that almo&s;t my whole army were con&s;tantly employed in repairing the old and con&s;tituting new works; and that, &s;o far from being guilty of a neglect of duty, amounting to a breach of orders, in that re&s;pect, I did every thing in my power to put the po&s;ts in a proper po&s;ture of defence.</P>
<P>The &s;econd charge is cowardice, treachery, and incapacity as a General, directed to be tried upon the 5th article of the 18th &s;ection of the Rules and Articles of War, and founded on the fourth remark of the Committee.</P>
<P>By Mr. Leavenworth's te&s;timony again are the&s;e horrid accu&s;ations to be &s;upported; not in a direct man|ner, but by inference and deduction from that part of it, which the Committee in the above remark &s;ay he gave them&punc; viz. "that the enemy were not annoyed in the advance to, and inve&s;titure of, the po&s;ts;" but which he, in part, has contradicted here, as I ob&s;erved before, and which, by Colonel Stevens, General
<PB N="45" REF="016141_0044_0F9C8037E34CE550">
Wilkin&s;on, Colonel Living&s;ton, Major Dunn, and others, I have proven to be fal&s;e. The inferences of con&s;equence are fal&s;e likewi&s;e, and of cour&s;e the charges groundle&s;s. But I believe it is the fir&s;t in&s;tance where charges of a capital nature have been brought again&s;t an officer by deduction, without a &s;hadow of proof to &s;upport them; and cowardice and treachery are capital crimes, although the Committee have directed them to be tried by an Article of War to which no capital crime whatever can be referred, having been expre&s;ly provided for crimes not capital. I wave, however, any advantage that might be taken of this. My reputa|tion, or my &s;afety, &s;hall never depend upon the blunders of any &s;ett of men who may think proper to accu&s;e me; but, when proof is wanting, candour will never attribute actions to the wor&s;t cau&s;e from which they could po&s;&s;ibly flow; good-nature will ever a&s;cribe them to the be&s;t. Hitherto, however, I have experienced very little of either. But my birth, Sir, my education, my connections, both in this country and in Britain, my &s;tation in life, my children (if to the&s;e had not been added the habitudes of early life) as they were the be&s;t pledges, &s;o they &s;hould have &s;ecured me from the imputation of tho&s;e mo&s;t &s;hameful vices, from which the meane&s;t of the people are generally free. But my reputation re&s;ts not on that bottom. I am happy in the general good opinion of the army, which is never be&s;towed upon cowards, nor has all the calumny that I have been loaded with &s;haken me a &s;ingle friend. The Court have the fulle&s;t evidence, that on every occa|&s;ion I have given demon&s;trations of an active, as well as pa&s;&s;ive, courage; my conduct in that re&s;pect has been uniform on all occa&s;ions; and this is confirmed by the concurring te&s;timony of many of the principal officers of the army, with &s;ome of whom I have been, per&s;onally, in almo&s;t every action that has happened during the war. From thence they mu&s;t conclude, that, whatever might have been the motives for my evacuating Ticonderoga, it could not have been owing to cowardice, and chat the charge is fal&s;e, malicious and &s;candalous.</P>
<P>Treachery, Sir, is a crime it is impo&s;&s;ible to prove, po&s;itively, not to have been committed. It is there|fore nece&s;&s;ary, in order to fix it, that &s;ome actual commi&s;&s;ion &s;hould be proven; but as this has not been attempted, it is enough alone to overthrow the charge. But I beg leave to inform the Court, that when Congre&s;s appointed me to the command of a regiment, I con&s;idered it as the call of my country, that could admit of no refu&s;al. I reflected that &s;ome knowledge acquired by &s;tudy, and the &s;ervice of the whole la&s;t war (during which I was in almo&s;t every &s;iege and every action of con&s;equence) put me in a &s;ituation to be of &s;ome u&s;e to our army in its infant &s;tate. My country, I thought, had a right to my &s;ervices, and to every advantage that could be derived from my experience. I therefore, without he&s;itation, re&s;igned an honourable and profitable employment I then held under the crown, to qualify my&s;elf for that offered to me by Congre&s;s, notwith&s;tanding it was not of one half the yearly value. I quitted die &s;weets of a retirement I was fond of, the plea&s;ures of dome&s;tic life, and the care of the education, and provi&s;ion for a ri&s;ing family, (both of which claimed my clo&s;e&s;t attention) for the toils, the hard&s;hips, and the extraordinary expences of war. Had this the appearance of treachery? And yet, for the&s;e, I have met with the ungracious return of tho&s;e cruel accu&s;ations, though, &s;urely, they were not the natural returns to &s;uch a conduct. What farther promotion Congre&s;s were plea&s;ed to confer upon me was totally un&s;olicited. I received it with gratitude, determined that my actions &s;hould be the be&s;t proof of the &s;en&s;e I had of the honour they had done me; nor have I been therein di&s;appointed. My country now reaps the &s;olid advantages of my conduct, whil&s;t I am loaded with obloquy and abu&s;e. I forgive it, however, but I can never forget that the channels of ju&s;tice have been &s;hut again&s;t me, and that for thirteen long, long months, I have been hung up to be &s;tung by the envenomed tongue of malice, and pointed at by the finger of folly. But the &s;entence of this Court will, I tru&s;t, place me once more in that honourable point of view, from which I have not de&s;erved to be removed, having been careful to ob&s;erve that maxim of Horace, <HI>Nil con&s;cire &s;ibi, nulla palle&s;cere culpa.</HI></P>
<P>How incapacity came to be a crime, unle&s;s in tho&s;e who made the appointments (for I mu&s;t repeat it, no office I have ever held, or now hold, under Congre&s;s, was ever &s;olicited by me) or by what Article of War it is triable, I own I do not know. But this charge, with the others, has been made upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that I did not do every thing in my power to oppo&s;e the operations of the enemy in their advance again&s;t, and in|ve&s;titure of, the po&s;ts in my charge; but it is in full proof to the Court that every thing was done, which pru|dence dictated, and circum&s;tances would allow. It follows, that this is equally groundle&s;s with the others.</P>
<P>The third charge is treachery again, under the &s;ame Article of War, to which, at I ob&s;erved before, it can|not be referred, and grounded upon the fifth remark of the Committee, which is, "that as it had been deter|mined in a Council of War on the 20th of June, that the repairing the old and adding new works on Mount Independence claimed immediate attention, and Je&s;&s;e Leavenworth &s;wears not a &s;troke was &s;truck for the&s;e purpo&s;es; and by the orderly book it appears the fatigue party was decrea&s;ed in number, and &s;o continued, at a time when it &s;hould have been abundantly increa&s;ed, I am liable to be charged with treachery." I have already &s;o fully refuted the&s;e matters in the charge for neglect, of duty, which is founded on the &s;ame allega|tions, that I think it unnece&s;&s;ary to take up the time of the Court with a repetition of the &s;ame arguments. But as it may, perhaps, appear odd, that the number of men actually employed on the&s;e duties differs &s;o widely from the orderly book, I will here, once for all, account for it. I never approved of putting all orders into the book. Accidents frequently happen to the copies; de&s;erters carry them off to the enemy, who thereby become perfectly acquainted with every thing you are doing; to prevent which, as our works were &s;o very incompleat, a great many of my orders were verbal. Yet I dare &s;ay, had the Committee attended to it, they would have found in the orderly book frequent orders for whole brigades (be&s;ides the daily details) to parade at certain hours, and take their orders from their re&s;pective Brigadiers; and had they called upon any officer of the army, they would have been informed the&s;e brigades were &s;ent upon fatigue, repairing the old and con&s;tructing new works, which has been proven to the Court in the fulle&s;t manner.</P>
<P>The fourth charge is, inattention to the progre&s;s of the enemy, treachery, and incapacity as a General again, founded on the &s;eventh remark of the Committee; which is, "that as General St. Clair informed the Honourable Mr. Jay, that, at the time of holding the Council of War on the 5th of July, he knew it to be impo&s;&s;ible to defend the po&s;ts with his numbers, it is natural to conclude he was decided upon this point as early as the 29th of June, the day that he &s;ent his &s;on and private effects from Ticonderoga to Fort George, as a place of &s;afety. That, being decided upon this point, it was his duty then to have taken as effectual mea&s;ures for the pre&s;ervation of the public property, at lea&s;t equally with his own, claiming his earlie&s;t atten|tion.
<PB N="46" REF="016141_0045_0F9C8039032F75D0">
That on the 30th of June, the enemy being advanced to Three Mile Point, it is incredible that he did not then know they were in force. That it was his duty, <HI>at that point of time,</HI> to have finally determined to abide the operations of the enemy, or to retire. That if the la&s;t re&s;olution was taken, and, from the &s;ending off his &s;on and baggage the day before, there is the &s;tronge&s;t pre&s;umption that this re&s;olution was <HI>then</HI> fully taken, it was his duty then to have proceeded to have &s;ent off the public &s;tores, to de&s;troy the works, and to evacuate the po&s;ts without lo&s;ing a moment of time; and that by deferring to retire till the la&s;t moment when he could po&s;&s;ibly retreat even with his effective troops, a moment when the &s;ick, ammunition, cannon, provi&s;ion and cloathing of the army mu&s;t be lo&s;t, be&s;ides the lives of many men in effecting a retreat from before an enemy immediately upon him, he appears to be chargeable with inattention to the progre&s;s of the enemy, with treachery, or with incapacity as a General." They appear to be again uncertain upon which charge to fix; but, to make &s;ure work of it, direct, as in the former ca&s;e, that I be pro&s;ecuted for each, and upon the beforementioned Article of War, which certainly cannot be applied to treachery. Bnt let us exa|mine what all this amounts to. The Committee &s;ay that becau&s;e I wrote to Mr. Jay, that on the 5th of July I knew it to be impo&s;&s;ible to defend the po&s;ts with my numbers, it is natural to conclude that I knew it to be impo&s;&s;ible to defend them with my numbers &s;o early as the 29th of June; for that they mu&s;t mean (if they mean any thing) by being "decided upon this point." But this is by no means the natural conclu&s;ion; the natural and candid conclu&s;ion is, that circum&s;tances might have changed betwixt the&s;e periods, and matters have come to my knowledge on or before the 5th of July, of which I was ignorant on the 29th of June, and which would fully ju&s;tify a change of mea&s;ures. But the rea&s;on they conclude in that manner is, that on that day I &s;ent my &s;on and private effects to Fort George, as a place of &s;afety; and this, I find by a former part of their report, is al&s;o the information of Mr. Leavenworth upon oath. Now it happens that, although I &s;ent my &s;on on that day to Fort George, I &s;ent no part of my baggage there then, or at any other time; and this very re&s;pectable witne&s;s, Mr. Leavenworth him&s;elf, &s;wears that I did not, to his knowledge. The account he has given of Head-Quarters being &s;tripped, as he calls it, is &s;o ab&s;urd, that was there no other te&s;timony to di&s;prove it, it would de&s;troy it&s;elf. But his te&s;timony before the Court contradicts, in almo&s;t every in|&s;tance, that the Committee &s;ay he has given to them. My &s;on was a boy betwixt eleven and twelve years of age, who, on the information I have mentioned to have received from the Pre&s;ident of Congre&s;s, that there was no probability of an active campaign&punc; I had taken with me, that I might &s;uperintend his education. He remained with me at Ticonderoga until matters wore a gloomy a&s;pect, and was then &s;ent to Fort George, on his way to Albany, where he was put to &s;chool. In ca&s;e of an attack, he would naturally have di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me, and divided my attention; and this is the dreadful affair of &s;ending my &s;on, that has been &s;o often repeat|ed, and upon which &s;o many ba&s;e ungenerous comments have been made. I have proven beyond the po&s;&s;ibi|lity of a doubt, that I never &s;ent away &s;ix-pence worth of my private effects, and that I took the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures for the pre&s;ervation of the public property, great part of which was brought off, whil&s;t my own was left a prey to the enemy. But it &s;eems it is incredible that the enemy &s;hould be at the Three Mile Point, where &s;ome of their ve&s;&s;els arrived on the 30th of June, and that I &s;hould not <HI>then</HI> know whether they were in force or not. The Committee have again forgot that the enemy were water-borne, and that at this time they had not debarked. Had that occurred to them, they would not have thought the matter &s;o very incredible. I believe they would have thought it very probable. But they &s;eem to have viewed one &s;ide of the picture only. I have proven to the Court, that from the number of &s;avages, who kept my parties at a di&s;tance from the &s;hores of the Lake, it was impo&s;&s;ible to obtain any &s;atisfactory account of the enemy's numbers until they were landed, which they began to be on the 30th of June, and with &s;o much caution, as appears by my letter of that date to Gen. Schuyler, that I had very good rea&s;on to conclude they were not in force, and to exult in that con&s;ideration too, hoping for an opportunity not only to have &s;erved my country, but in &s;ome mea&s;ure to have filled the expectations I knew the public had formed from me. The re&s;olution to retire was therefore not "<HI>then</HI> fully taken." But what idea of military movements mu&s;t the&s;e gentlemen have? who conclude that an enemy at three miles di&s;tance is not immediately upon you, or who imagine that works may be de&s;troyed, and &s;tores, ammunition and cannon, &amp;c. removed, under the eye of a &s;uperior and collected force. Sir, had a retreat been attempted upon the enemy's landing at Three Mile Point, and the &s;teps pur&s;ued which the Com|mittee have enumerated above, it is impo&s;&s;ible, in the nature of things, but the army mu&s;t have been cut off, or fallen pri&s;oners into their hands. But, by our putting a good face upon the matter, and &s;hewing a determination to hold both po&s;ts, they were induced to divide their force, in order to inve&s;t us and reduce us by the more &s;low, but certain, method of regular approach; not that this method was nece&s;&s;ary to them, for they might mo&s;t certainly have carried us by a&s;&s;ault at any time: But a&s;&s;aults are frequently very bloody things! and on that circum&s;tance I chiefly depended for rendering my &s;mall garri&s;on &s;erviceable to their country. I was in hopes the enemy would a&s;&s;ault us, and &s;ome accounts that I had, that they were &s;hort of provi&s;ions, gave me &s;ome rea&s;on to expect it. I depended upon my troops&mdash;I was per&s;waded they were brave, and I believe they too had confidence in me. Every order and every advice I gave them pointed directly to that object&mdash; and I &s;till believe that, had they attempted it, we &s;hould have given &s;o good an account of them, that the conque&s;t of Ticonderoga would have terminated the operations of that campaign&mdash;but conquered it would have been, after all our exertions. Every letter I have wrote holds up the &s;ame idea, and I always &s;peak of an attack as contra-di&s;tingui&s;hed from a &s;iege; and the character of the General I was oppo&s;ed to gave me rea&s;on to expect &s;omething by a&s;&s;ault or &s;urprize. I mentioned to Congre&s;s, &s;o early as the 25th of June, the great deficiencies in troops and provi&s;ion, and the probability of my being obliged from the&s;e circum|&s;tances to evacuate. The moment I was informed, with any tolerable degree of certainty, of their numbers, which I was not until the 3d of July from a pri&s;oner and &s;ome de&s;erters (their information was confirmed by a &s;py I &s;ent into their camp the 3d and returned the 5th) and &s;aw that they meant a regular &s;iege, I was certain the defending the po&s;ts effectually was impo&s;&s;ible. The moment, however, which I cho&s;e for the re|treat, as it was the only one was ever in my power to chu&s;e, &s;o it was almo&s;t the only one after the enemy's landing at Three Mile Point in which the retreat could have been effected. I have fully proven that the &s;ick were not left behind nor lo&s;t, that great part of the cannon, all the ammunition, the baggage and tents of the army, the ho&s;pital &s;tores and part of the provi&s;ion, were removed from Ticonderoga&mdash;as much as could at once have been removed at any prior time. Every boat was loaded. I think I have proven it to have been ne|ce&s;&s;ary

and well conducted, and that the confu&s;ion, occa&s;ioned principally by the burning of General Fermoy's hou&s;e, and his not circulating the orders to his brigade in proper time, was &s;oon remedied.&mdash;I beg the Court to reflect one moment upon what was to be done, and now &s;hort the time to do it in!&mdash;for, though the evacuation was re&s;olved on about three o'clock in the afternoon, we could not begin to carry it into execution until night came on, the enemy being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a high hill on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the Lake, from whence they could &s;ee our every movement,&mdash;that it was the &s;ea&s;on when the nights are at the very &s;horte&s;t, and that it was moreover moon-light,&mdash;and that the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping the matter a &s;ecret, until the very mo|ment of evacuation, prevented any preparatory &s;teps being taken to expedite the bu&s;ine&s;s, and they will be of the opinion that more was never done, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> in equal time; and if, in the different embarkations, &s;ome irregularities did happen, when every circum&s;tance is taken in&mdash;the &s;uddenne&s;s of the thing&mdash;the di&s;|po&s;ition every man would naturally have to &s;ave perhaps his little all&mdash;the confu&s;ion the night alone is apt to occa&s;ion&mdash;the di&s;tance every thing had to be carried, and their variety, the candid mind will be more apt to wonder that any order could be pre&s;erved, than that &s;ome irregularities &s;upervened. On this occa&s;ion it would be great inju&s;tice not to acknowledge, that the officers were in general diligent and attentive, and the men &s;ilent and obedient to a wonder; the continental troops I mean; for the militia, Bellows's and Robe|&s;on's regiments excepted, held a very different conduct. Colonel Bellows exerted him&s;elf greatly in removing the cannon from the lines and embarking them, which he effected, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome difficulties that, I have &s;ince heard, were thrown in his way by an officer of the artillery. I was in a very particular manner obliged to General Poor, Colonel Long, Colonel Hay, and Colonel Stevens, to who&s;e pains and a&s;&s;iduity it was chiefly owing that &s;o much of the public property was taken off. It is true, however, the greate&s;t part of it fell afterwards into the enemy's hands at Skeen&s;borough, but not from any fault of mine. That was the only place to which they could have been removed; and had not my march been delayed, as has been &s;hewn, by Colonel Warner's unfortunately taking upon him&s;elf to judge of and di&s;obey his orders, I &s;hould have arrived at Skeen&s;borough time enough to have protected the &s;tores, and probably to have cut off that party of the enemy which pur&s;ued them. I agree perfectly with the Committee, that the po&s;ts, as the proper number of men for their defence were not &s;ent to them, &s;hould have been evacuated earlier. But I did my duty. I apprized both Congre&s;s and General Schuyler of my &s;ituation, and the probable con&s;equences; and from one or other of them, if it was thought proper to evacuate the po&s;ts, my orders were to come&punc; From the&s;e circum&s;tances, it appears that I have not been guilty of treachery or incapacity. But it is truly &s;urpriz|ing that gentlemen, who had the peru&s;al of my letters to General Schuyler, &s;hould have alledged inattention to the progre&s;s of the enemy, as in every one of them, viz. tho&s;e of the 13th, 18th, 24th, 25th, 26th, 28th and 30th of June, and 1&s;t, 2d and 3d of July, I make particular mention of their progre&s;s, and the &s;teps taken to obtain a knowledge of it.</P>
<P>The fifth and la&s;t charge is, "Shamefully abandoning the po&s;ts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, in my charge," and this is directed to be founded upon the &s;eventh remark, which has ju&s;t been under con|&s;ideration. The puni&s;hment of this crime, Sir, is death, without alternative. No pre&s;umptive evidence, therefore, can be admitted, no con&s;truction can be allowed, to fix it; but the fact mu&s;t be proven in the cleare&s;t and mo&s;t po&s;itive manner. But in the remark of the Committee referred to, I do not find a &s;ingle circum&s;tance that relates to it, except a loo&s;e a&s;&s;ertion, for which I am bold to &s;ay they had no warrant either from rea&s;on or evidence. It is this: "Nor can the proving, as General St. Clair wi&s;hes to do, that the works of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were too exten&s;ive, and that the troops were very badly armed, if &s;uch things can be proved, fail of placing General St. Clair in a more reprehen&s;ible point of view; as, the weakne&s;s of his defence being more obvious, his retreat &s;hould have been earlier determined upon and made." I have proven by General Gates, General Schuyler, General Poor, and Colonels Baldwin and Ko&s;eiu&s;zko, the engineers, and a number of other witne&s;&s;es, that the works were much too exten&s;ive for my numbers; by General Gates, that the numbers were not one fourth of what he demanded, and Congre&s;s had voted, at a time he did not expect the enemy would have come on with 10 or 11,000 men, and not much more than a fifth of what he would have demanded in that ca&s;e, exclu&s;ive of the militia, which he had powers to call for, in any number he thought proper; by General Schuyler and General Poor, that they would at lea&s;t have demanded 10,000 good troops; by Major Hull's certificate, and the returns of arms from the offi||cers commanding regiments, that many of the men were very badly armed. And, with the Committee's good leave, although the weakne&s;s of my defence was certainly from the&s;e circum&s;tances the more obvious, yet, as proper notice thereof was in due time given both to Congre&s;s and General Schuyler, neither of whom gave any directions about the matter, and I had no power of my&s;elf to order the evacuation until the la&s;t extremity, I cannot thereby be placed in a point of view reprehen&s;ible in any degree what&s;oever. As the proof here fails entirely, the charge mu&s;t fail with it. But, Sir, the po&s;ts were not &s;hamefully abandoned. The retreat was undertaken upon the ju&s;te&s;t principles, and, I hope the Court will bear with me when I &s;ay, upon the mo&s;t honourable and ingenuous motives; the mea&s;ures to effect it were taken with judgment; the orders were pertinent and clear; and the whole, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome cro&s;s accidents, which it was not po&s;|&s;ible to fore&s;ee, was conducted with a degree of art, that reflects &s;ome credit upon both the General and the troops. I need not tell this honourable Court that a retreat, with an inferior army, from before a &s;uperior one, is perhaps the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> delicate and dangerous undertaking in the whole circle of military operations, and that it never will be effected without prudence, fortitude and &s;ecrecy. I hope I have &s;atisfied the Court, that I could not order the evacuation until the la&s;t moment, when I &s;aw no alternative betwixt that and the certain lo&s;s of the army. I think I have proven that that moment was arrived, as one day more would probably have compleated the inve&s;tment of the po&s;ts, and then it would have been impo&s;&s;ible. I have proven that my motive was not to avoid the enemy, but to &s;ave the army, and by removing them to a place where rein|forcements could reach them, to make them &s;erve as the ba&s;is of a force &s;ufficient to cover the country, and check the progre&s;s of the enemy; and this I did with the certainty of a lo&s;s of reputation, a price few people are willing to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words"> for the pro&s;perity of their country! I indeed expected it would be a temporary lo&s;s of reputation only, nor will it be more, though it has already been of much longer duration than I looked for; and I fear the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> long delaying to afford me an opportunity to vindicate my character, is not very likely to induce others who may happen in like circum&s;tances to make a &s;imilar &s;acrifice. My letter to Congre&s;s.
<PB N="48" REF="016141_0047_0F9C803A246DED80">
of the 14th of July, proves, that I fore&s;aw the events that would probably happen, and which mu&s;t have had &s;ome effect upon my determinations.</P>
<P>Indeed, from the knowledge I had of the country through which General Burgoyne had to advance,&mdash;the difficulties I knew he would be put to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;ub&s;i&s;t his army,&mdash;and the contempt he would naturally have for an enemy, who&s;e retreat I concluded he would a&s;cribe to fear, I made no doubt but he would &s;oon be &s;o far en|gaged, as that it would be difficult for him either to advance or retreat. The event ju&s;tified my conjecture, but attended with con&s;equences beyond my mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations. A fatal blow given to the power and in&s;olence of Great-Britain, a whole army pri&s;oners, and the reputation of the arms of America high in every civilized part of the world! But what would have been the con&s;equences had not that &s;tep been taken, and my army had been cut to pieces or made pri&s;oners? Di&s;grace would have been brought upon our arms and our coun&s;els,&mdash;fear and di&s;may would have &s;eized upon the inhabitants, from the fal&s;e opinion that had been formed of the &s;trength of the&s;e po&s;ts,&mdash;wringing grief and moping melancholy would have filled the now chearful habitations of tho&s;e who&s;e deare&s;t connections were in that army,&mdash;and a lawle&s;s ho&s;t of ru&s;&s;ians, &s;et loo&s;e from every &s;ocial tie, would have roam'd at liberty through the defencele&s;s country, whil&s;t bands of &s;a|vages would have carried havoc, deva&s;tation and terror before them! Great part of the &s;tate of New-York mu&s;t have &s;ubmitted to the conqueror, and in it he would have found the means to enable him to pro&s;ecute his &s;ucce&s;s. He would have been able effectually to have co-operated with General Howe, and would proba|bly have &s;oon been in the &s;ame country with him&mdash;that country, where our illu&s;trious General, with an infe|rior force, made &s;o glorious a &s;tand, but who mu&s;t have been obliged to retire if both armies came upon him at once, or he might have been forced, perhaps, to a general and deci&s;ive action in unfavourable circum|&s;tances, whereby the hopes, the now well-founded hopes of America, of liberty, peace and &s;afety, might have been cut off for ever. Every con&s;ideration &s;erves to prove the propriety of the retreat, that I could not undertake it &s;ooner, and that had it been delayed longer it had been delayed too long. But it may ju&s;tly be matter of wonder why Congre&s;s, who, &s;o early as the twenty-ninth of April, declared their opinion, as appears by the re&s;olve of that date, which has been read, that unle&s;s certain mea&s;ures were pur&s;ued by the ea&s;tern &s;tates for compleating and forwarding without delay the troops ordered for that &s;ervice, the important po&s;ts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence mu&s;t inevitably be lo&s;t, and who mu&s;t have known from the returns, if it can be &s;uppo&s;ed they knew through no other channel, that no &s;uch, mea&s;ures had been pur&s;ued, nor even any taken to replace the corps of militia who&s;e times of &s;ervice had expired, and had left the po&s;ts, it may be ju&s;tly matter of wonder, I &s;ay, that they &s;hould not have ordered the evacuation, in proper time to have &s;aved every article of public property. It has been proved that my numbers were greatly inadequate to the defence of the po&s;ts. But I mu&s;t acknowledge a mi&s;take I made with re&s;pect to the&s;e numbers. At the Council of War held on the 5th of July, I &s;tated them at 2089 rank and file, fit for duty; to which &s;hould have been added 457 of tho&s;e returned on command, and who were within the garri&s;on, which brings them up to 2546. I took the account from the general return, and did not recollect that the regiments had a cu&s;tom of returning men on particular duties in camp as on command, nor was this noted at the foot of die general return. It was a mi&s;take, but not &s;uch a one as would have made any alter|ation, had it not happened. It has been proven by General Schuyler, that, had the garri&s;on held out, he could not have rai&s;ed the &s;iege, as he had not been able to collect a &s;ufficient force, and that, if a &s;ufficient force had been collected, the &s;iege could not have been rai&s;ed for want of ball. But, had the po&s;ts been eva|cuated &s;ooner, I am per&s;waded there would have no little been &s;aid about the va&s;t numbers of militia that would have come to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, had the po&s;ts been held longer; and the&s;e reports would have been be|lieved, and added no little to the opprobrium under which I &s;hould have lain. I am, however, of the &s;ame opinion with my late worthy friend Mr. Living&s;ton, then a Member of Congre&s;s, who u&s;ed to &s;ay&mdash;that, had I left Ticonderoga one week &s;ooner, I &s;hould certainly have been hanged, and probably without the ceremony of a court-martial. But, Sir, if it is &s;hameful for an inferior army to retreat before a &s;uperior one, we mu&s;t begin and unlearn what we have been &s;pending years in reading to acquire; and hi&s;tory, in&s;tead of being a faithful guide to the unexperienced, has been hanging out fal&s;e lights for many centuries, to mi&s;lead the unwary traveller. According to this doctrine, &s;ome of the mo&s;t famous actions of antiquity, and which we have been taught to con&s;ider as ma&s;ter-pieces of &s;kill, were &s;hameful retreats, and founded in cowardice, treachery or incapacity. The famous retreat of Brafidas, with his Lacedemonians&mdash;the retreat of the Con|&s;ul Attilius Colatinus, among&s;t the Romans&mdash;Mar&s;hal Banier, among&s;t the Sweedes&mdash;Mar&s;hal Bellei&s;le, among&s;t the French&mdash;and, to add to the catalogue one of our times, that of his Excellency General Wa&s;h|ington from New-York&mdash;were all &s;hamefully abandoning po&s;ts. But impartial po&s;terity, as it formed a better judgment of tho&s;e, &s;o will it al&s;o do of that; and whil&s;t the candid hi&s;torian dwells with rapture upon the many &s;hining events that have been produced by that di&s;tingui&s;hed Chief, he will point to that retreat, as the beginning of a &s;y&s;tem that has en&s;ured the Liberties of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></P>

<P>I have now got through the main body of the charges, but there are &s;till &s;ome light parties of Commi&s;|&s;aries and others, intended to act, I &s;uppo&s;e, as irregulars, with whom there mu&s;t be &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hing; for though their te&s;timony has not the lea&s;t connection with any of the charges, it has taken up the time of the Court, and makes a con&s;iderable figure in the proceedings. The provi&s;ion returns I &s;uppo&s;e are meant, in|directly, to &s;trengthen the charges or to create a &s;u&s;picion of carele&s;&s;ne&s;s or wa&s;te in that article.</P>
<P>I have admitted Mr. Yancey's return of the 20th of June, which &s;tates that there was on hand at Ticon|deroga and its dependencies at that time 2015 barrels of flour, 195 barrels of beef, and 784 barrels of pork; on which the Committee, having taken an e&s;timate of Mr. Avery's (which &s;tates that 1400 barrels of
<PB N="49" REF="016141_0048_0F9C803AE31CDC70">
flour, and 661 barrels of beef, would afford &s;ufficient provi&s;ion in flour for 4000 men for 66 days, and in beef for 75) for a foundation conclude, that there did on the 4th of July remain, or ought to be, if provi&s;ions had been properly and regularly i&s;&s;ued, then remaining, 1625 barrels of flour, 3 barrels of beef, and 784 barrels of pork; which, they &s;ay, was a magazine &s;ufficient to afford <HI>full allowance</HI> of provi&s;ion to 5659 men of all ranks for 52 days in flour, and 32 days in beef and pork.</P>
<P>But Mr. Avery's &s;tatement is egregiou&s;ly wrong; 1400 barrels of flour, averaging them at 200 lbs. and 651 barrels of beef, averaging them at 212 lbs. &s;uppo&s;ing the ration to be a pound of each, will afford 4000 rations of flour for 70 days, and of beef for 35 days only. But in 4000 men there will be 322 officers (I have taken the proportionate number of officers to the troops at Ticonderoga as the foundation) who, on an average, are entitled to draw three rations, and con&s;equently for 4000 men, who have that proportion of officers, 4644 rations mu&s;t be i&s;&s;ued daily, which the &s;tock above-mentioned would afford no longer than 60 days of flour, and 30 days of meat.</P>
<P>But the ration at Ticonderoga was a pound and a half of flour, and a pound of fle&s;h (beef or pork) the addition having been made in lieu of vegetables and other articles, to which the &s;oldier was entitled, but which the Commi&s;&s;ary could not furni&s;h. This Mr. Avery mu&s;t have been acquainted with, and &s;hould have taken into the account; and this reduces the magazine to 40 days flour in&s;tead of 66, and 30 days meat in|&s;tead of 75. As the&s;e are matters in which there is not the lea&s;t intricacy, depending upon the mo&s;t &s;imple calculation, the Committee &s;hould certainly have &s;atisfied them&s;elves Mr. Avery's e&s;timate was right, before they adopted it as a principle: As the principle is fal&s;e, all the &s;uper&s;tructure they have rai&s;ed upon it falls to the ground. But the quantity is &s;till over-rated; for it is certain, that in the divi&s;ion and di&s;tribution of provi&s;ion they &s;uffer con&s;iderable wa&s;te.&mdash;I believe an allowance of five <HI>per cent.</HI> is made to the Commi&s;&s;aries on that account, therefore five <HI>per cent.</HI> is to be deducted from the whole quantity, viz.

and the above quantities of flour and beef, divided by 7000 for the beef, and 10,500 for the flour (one half mu&s;t be added for the half-pound) leaves of flour for twenty-nine days, and of beef for nineteen nearly; an ample provi&s;ion for a &s;iege! Neither is this calculation made upon a liberal plan, with re&s;pect to Ticonderoga, but a very narrow one, indeed a very narrow one any where, as neither the ho&s;pital, the &s;ailors, the batteau-men, or any followers of the army are taken into the account; nor any notice taken of the inhabitants who
<PB N="50" REF="016141_0049_0F9C803BA51EAF80">
had been driven from their hou&s;es, and were nece&s;&s;arily furni&s;hed with provi&s;ions at that po&s;t, to enable them to reach the inhabited parts of the country; neither is there any notice taken of the real weight of the barrels, which, from the manner of packing them, fall greatly &s;hort, both flour and meat, of what I have calculated upon. I have proved by General Schuyler that the barrels of meat are generally about 170 pounds, which would reduce that article to about ten days provi&s;ion. I have never pretended, for all this, that the want of provi&s;ion obliged me to evacuate the po&s;ts, but the low &s;tate of the magazines, and the little pro&s;pect which it has been proven I had of an effectual &s;upply, prevented me from calling in the militia: The Court will judge if it would not have been madne&s;s to have done it in the&s;e circum&s;tances, and they will plea&s;e to recol|lect that it is in proof, that although &s;ome provi&s;ion was forwarded from Fort George after the 20th of June, the greate&s;t part of it was &s;ent back, the enemy having cut off the communication betwixt Ticonderoga and the landing previous to its arrival. I grant that an officer commanding at a po&s;t is in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;pon&s;i|ble for the expenditure of the provi&s;ion; and I am bold to &s;ay, that during my command, as far as it depend|ed upon me, provi&s;ion was i&s;&s;ued with great <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">conomy.</P>
<P>Mr. Avery &s;ays that he did not know what quantity of provi&s;ion was on hand at Ticonderoga on the 13th of June, the time I took the command there, but that on the 15th or 16th of June I wrote to him that there was provi&s;ion at the po&s;ts for &s;even weeks. From his manner of mentioning this, one would imagine I had wrote merely for his information, and all was well; but the fact is, and he has owned it, though with apparent reluctance, that the de&s;ign of my letter to him was, to complain of the &s;mall quantity of provi&s;ion, and pre&s;s a further &s;upply in a decent, at the &s;ame time the &s;tronge&s;t manner, by putting him in mind of the ill con|&s;equences to him&s;elf that might attend a failure. This letter he never thought proper to an&s;wer, or give me the lea&s;t &s;atisfaction whether I might expect &s;upplies or not. It has been proven that the magazine at Albany was empty, and part of the provi&s;ion that had been forwarded to Still Water, on its way to Ticonderoga, was carried back for the &s;upply of that po&s;t. Upon my way from Albany to Ticonderoga I found the ma|gazine at Fort Edward in the &s;ame ca&s;e, and the provi&s;ion that had been forwarded from thence to Fort George bringing back to &s;upply the troops at that po&s;t; as appears by my letter to General Schuyler of the 10th of June, from Fort George. Mr. Yancey indeed &s;ays, he had heard of &s;alt provi&s;ion having been &s;ent from Bennington to St. Coak, but is ignorant of the quantity, but does not pretend to &s;ay there was any magazine from which the po&s;ts at Ticonderoga could have been &s;upplied. That very provi&s;ion &s;ent from Still Water to Albany was part of that which came from Bennington; but why &s;hould I multiply words, Mr. Avery acknowledges he was deceived by the people he had employed to purcha&s;e provi&s;ion, "they did not collect the quantity he expected." It is true, &s;ome cattle arrived at Ticonderoga the day before the evacuation, I believe about forty,&mdash;they arrived too late to be of any u&s;e in the garri&s;on, but they were of great u&s;e on the retreat.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid the ration at Ticonderoga was a pound and a half of bread and a pound of beef or pork, but I am not able to prove it. The march of a part of the army has deprived me of &s;everal witne&s;&s;es I intended to have examined. I know it, however, to have been the ca&s;e. The Commi&s;&s;aries who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to be perfectly acquainted with what was i&s;&s;ued as a ration, know nothing about the matter, neither Principal nor Deputy. Mr. Avery knows nothing about it, for he was at Albany; Mr. Yancey knows nothing about it, for he was purcha&s;ing cattle; and Mr. Boyer, the I&s;&s;uing Commi&s;&s;ary on the ground, is not certain what it was: He &s;ays, he believes it to have been a pound of bread and a pound of beef, or three-quarters of a pound of pork. He acknowledges the men did not receive the other component parts of a ration. They got briefs for them. He likewi&s;e acknowledges, that during the time he was at the po&s;t the &s;ame quantity of bread and meat war i&s;&s;ued as a ration, that had been cu&s;tomary before and at the time he came into office. Now it is certain that a pound of bread and a pound of beef, or three-quarters of a pound of pork, is not a &s;ufficient allowance for a &s;oldier, e&s;pecially when, as was the ca&s;e at Ticonderoga, he is kept con&s;tantly to hard labour; his brief he cannot eat; and it is al&s;o certain that the Commi&s;&s;aries did not furni&s;h them with vegetables and the other &s;mall articles; it is therefore probable that the quantity of bread and meat was in|crea&s;ed. But in June, 1776, in Canada, General Sullivan ordered that, where milk could not be procured, the troops &s;hould have a pound and a half of beef or eighteen ounces of pork <HI>per diem,</HI> be&s;ides mola&s;&s;es, rice, Indian meal and pea&s;e; and this continued to be the allowance in meat until &s;ome time after General Gates took the command, who altered it from a pound and a half of beef, or eighteen ounces of pork, to a pound of either, and added half a pound to the quantity of bread; and this alteration was induced, chiefly, by the prevalence of bilious complaints, which it was expected le&s;&s;ening the quantity of animal and increa&s;ing the quantity of vegetable food would help to abate: That continued to be the ration at the&s;e po&s;ts until the evacuation, &s;ome temporary alterations excepted, when the troops were &s;upplied with vegetables. And this rea&s;oning is confirmed by General Wayne's orderly book, by which it appears, that on the 30th of December he reduced the quantity of flour to one pound and a quarter, and of meat to one pound, vegetables being then i&s;&s;ued by the Commi&s;&s;ary, agreeable to the re&s;olve of Congre&s;s of the 28th of December, 1776; and, doubtle&s;s, when the&s;e were expended, the ration returned to its former &s;tandard.</P>

<P>The attention of the Court has been a good deal taken up with a quantity of tallow that was in the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of Mr. Leavenworth. He &s;ays, I think, that he informed me of it on the 26th of June, and it may be that he did &s;o; but as I knew Leavenworth to be a private per&s;on, and as I had no official account of any tallow, I concluded it was altogether a private affair, &s;ome money-making job betwixt him and the Commi&s;|&s;ary. Reflecting, however, on the quantity, which was &s;urprizingly great, 34,345 pounds, and finding it was public property, I determined to have &s;ent it to Fort George by the fir&s;t opportunity; but before any op|portunity offered, that communication was cut off. Mr. Yancey acknowledges he had never made any return of this tallow, tho' it mu&s;t have been great part of a year on hand. If he had, I &s;hould not have &s;uffered it to remain there; tho' it might perhaps have been worked up at that place more to his profit, had he been allowed to employ &s;oldiers, which &s;eems to have been his expectation. As he never did make any return of it, and the only account I ever had was from a private per&s;on, a very &s;hort time before the communication with Fort George was &s;topped, the lo&s;s of it is ju&s;tly chargeable to his negligence, and he ought to be re|&s;pon&s;ible for it.</P>
<P>The &s;econd remark of the Committee is a mi&s;repre&s;entation of my letter to General Schuyler of the 24th of June. They &s;ay I was on that day informed by my &s;couts that the enemy were very numerous, and on the next wrote to Congre&s;s that I was not able to di&s;cover whether the enemy were in force or not. Let the letter &s;peak for it&s;elf. "Serjeant Heath, who I &s;ent down the Lake to make di&s;coveries, returned la&s;t night, and informs me that, from a place near the mouth of Otter-Creek, he de&s;cried an encampment of the enemy on both &s;ides of Gilliland's Creek; that, from the appearance and the extent, <HI>he thinks</HI> it mu&s;t contain a great body of men; and that a great many &s;mokes aro&s;e at a di&s;tance back, which he &s;uppo&s;es was from the en|campments of the Indians;" and again, "that one of the inhabitants, in whom he could place confidence, informed him the <HI>Indians were very numerous</HI>;" and in another place, "that another inhabitant informed him, that &s;ome of the enemy's troops had &s;aid their whole army was there," that is, at Gilliland's Creek. Now, Sir, is there any thing in all this like po&s;itive intelligence that the enemy were <HI>very numerous?</HI> No, Sir, there is not. The encampment was &s;een from a very con&s;iderable di&s;tance, acro&s;s the Lake, and the &s;erjeant <HI>thinks</HI> that, from the <HI>appearance</HI> of it, it might contain a great body of men. An inhabitant, indeed, <HI>told</HI> him the <HI>Indians</HI> were very numerous. Four or five hundred, Sir, is a large body of Indians, and what the inhabitants any where would call very numerous, but ten times that number is not a great body of troops; and for aught I knew, and had rea&s;on to believe, the whole of their army left in Canada did not amount to that number. There was therefore no incon&s;i&s;tency in my writing to Congre&s;s on the 25th of June, that I was not able to di&s;cover whether the enemy were in force or not, notwith&s;tanding the information I received by my &s;couts on the 24th. But, in the &s;ame letter, I gave General Schuyler my rea&s;ons for not believing that there was a great body of men in that encampment (of which the Committee do not think proper to take any notice) viz. that it was improbable the enemy would wa&s;te their time at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the object again&s;t which they were to act, in a country that afforded them nothing (the inhabitants had all left that &s;ide of the Lake the year before) and they had been there four or five days; and I thought the ground, on which Heath de&s;cribed the encampment to be, incapable of containing a great number of men. There|fore it was more probable that it was a party only &s;ent to amu&s;e, and to give confidence to the &s;avages. Had I given Congre&s;s other information than I did on the 25th of June, it had been a fal&s;hood.</P>
<P>I have now got through the whole of this matter, and it clearly appears there is not the &s;malle&s;t foun|dation for all, or any of the charges again&s;t me.&mdash;On the contrary, it has been proven beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of a doubt, that I did every thing which my duty required, and that circum&s;tances would allow. I have therefore good rea&s;on to expect the deci&s;ion of this Court in my favour. Yet I &s;till &s;hall have it to regret, that the accu&s;ations have &s;pread far and wide, and been greedily &s;wallowed for truth, whil&s;t few, comparatively very few, will ever hear of the honourable acquittal.</P>
<P>If in the cour&s;e of this bu&s;ine&s;s I have appeared with confidence, I hope I have not with arrogance; and though I have examined the report of the Committee of Congre&s;s with freedom, I have not forgot to do it with decency. No man can have a higher &s;en&s;e than I have of the re&s;pect in which Congre&s;s ought to be held; but a dignified conduct can alone &s;ecure re&s;pect to any man, or body of men. That conduct this Congre&s;s will, no doubt, ever pre&s;erve. But &s;hould &s;ome future Congre&s;s depart from the great bu&s;ine&s;s of watching over the affair of a whole continent, to hunt down an individual&mdash;&s;hould factions ari&s;e among&s;t them, and local intere&s;ts take place of the general intere&s;t&mdash;&s;hould their time be wa&s;ted in frivolous and end|le&s;s di&s;putes, where the object is a mere boyi&s;h de&s;ire of victory, whil&s;t the public &s;ervice &s;tands &s;till, and its hone&s;t &s;ervants tired out with tedious and expen&s;ive waiting&mdash;and &s;hould they create offices with great &s;alaries, where tho&s;e who hold them may rob the public at their plea&s;ure, without a po&s;&s;ibility of detection, and cabal among&s;t them&s;elves for the di&s;po&s;al of them&mdash;and &s;hould they pa&s;s re&s;olves, ridiculous in them|&s;elves and impo&s;&s;ible to be carried into execution&mdash;then will Congre&s;s &s;ink into contempt, nor will all the importance they may endeavour to a&s;&s;ume, nor the fa&s;tidious pomp they may di&s;play, &s;upport them, and then will the misfortunes of America begin.</P>
