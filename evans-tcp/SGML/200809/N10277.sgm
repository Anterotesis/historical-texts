<P>I am a Carpenter, and live in Oxford Chapple-Court. On the 6th of De|cember la&s;t, the Pri&s;oner came to me, and a&s;ked me if I had not given a note, payable to I&s;aac Levi, or order? I &s;aid I had, and that I was defrauded out of it, and till it become due I &s;hould not pay it. I &s;aid I was very bu&s;y then, but would meet him any where the next day. We appointed to meet at the Valiant Trooper in Oxford-Road. The next morning I went, and acquainted Mr. Hall with it, and told him I had one of my notes come back again that I had been defrauded out of, and begged he would go along with me to meet this per&s;on. We went and met the pri&s;oner, and after having pleaded poverty, telling him I had been de|frauded out of it, he de&s;ired us to go out and con&s;ult between our&s;elves what I would give him: we went out, and agreed for me to give him five guineas.</P>

<P>He &s;aid he had given the full value for it, we told him, when we returned to him I would give him five pounds; he &s;aid that it was but little more than two &s;hillings in the pound The note was dated the 10th of Oct. 1768, for 50l. Some more words pa&s;t be|tween us: he &s;aid he was going out of town, and that that note kept him in town longer

<P>It was. This was on the 7th of Decem|ber. I produced five guineas on the table, he was very unwilling to produce the note, but at la&s;t be did produce it to Mr. Hall. Mr. Hall looked at it, and a&s;ked him how he came by it, laying it was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> indor&s;ed He de&s;ired me to look at it, and &s;ee if it was my hand wri|ting, I &s;aid it was not, it was forged; I took my money up, and Mr. Hall took up the note, and put it in his pocket-book. Some time af|ter he made a pretence to go out to make water; Mr Hall went out after him, but I &s;aw no more of him till Mr. Hall brought him in again, and &s;aid the pri&s;oner had run away, and he had brought him back; after that, Mr. Hall de&s;ired me to go out of the room, that they might &s;ettle between them&s;elves; after that I came in again; then Mr Hall a&s;ked me if the pri&s;oner &s;hould go about his bu&s;ine&s;s; I &s;aid no, he &s;hould go before a magi&s;trate.

<P>How was you defrauded out of the note?</P>

<SPEAKER>Little.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was defrauded out of two 50l. notes by a Jew. I had occa&s;ion for money, and I
<PB N="8" REF="013047_0005_0F9533918B761118">
gave a Jew two 50l. notes, and he was to bring me the money next morning, but he kept the notes, and never brought the money. One was dated the 10th of October, four months after date, the &s;ame as this, and the other &s;ix months after date. The Jew is now in the King's Bench Pri&s;on. The Pri&s;oner told me one of the notes was paid away, and the other might be recovered he believed.</P>

<P>Had you any &s;ecurity for the&s;e notes you delivered to the Jew?</P>

<SPEAKER>John Hall.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am a carpenter. On the 7th of December Mr. Little came to my hou&s;e, and told me a gentleman had come to his hou&s;e with one of his 50l. notes that he had been defrauded of, and that he was to meet him the next day at the valiant trooper in Oxford Road, and he de&s;ired me to go along with him; which I did. When we came there, Mr. Lit|tle went in &s;ome time before me, may be two &s;econds; I followed after and &s;aw him and the pri&s;oner in a private room together, the pri&s;o|ner
<PB N="9" REF="013047_0006_0F953391F0ED6BD0">
had got a pine of beer; the pri&s;oner looked at me. Mr. Little &s;aid, This is one of my friends, it is no &s;ecret, he knows I have been defrauded out of the&s;e note. They began talk|ing about the notes. Mr Little a&s;ked him whether he had given credit for the note or not; the pri&s;oner &s;aid he had not, but that Le|vi had goods of him for it; and he &s;aid he wondered that Mr Little was &s;o &s;imple as to give the note to the Jew, and bid him be careful always to look upon a Jew as a thief: he farther &s;aid, Levi told him it was as good as a Bank note. I &s;poke to the pri&s;oner, and told him Mr Little was a poor man, and not able to pay the notes when they became due, nor neither would he. The pri&s;oner &s;aid, that when they became due, Mr. Little mu&s;t be arre&s;ted for them, and he mu&s;t bail it, and it would co&s;t him 4 or 5 and 20l. to defend it, and then he was to throw it into chancery, before he could recover the note, and told us of a man that was defrauded out of &s;ome notes as Mr. Little was, one Mr. Taylor in Bond-Street, by a Jew, and he was advi&s;ed to take half the value of the note He told Mr. Little he did not chu&s;e to hurt him, that it was bet|ter for him to lo&s;e pa&s;t of it, than all, and de|&s;ired him to go out with me and con&s;ult both together what he could afford to give. Mr.
<PB N="10" REF="013047_0007_0F953392AC5CC020">
Little and I went out together into the tap|room. I told Mr. Little to offer him five gui|neas: Mr. Little &s;aid, he could not for &s;hame offer him &s;o little as five guineas: I &s;aid you may offer it, you may advance, if that will not do: We went in, he offered the pri&s;oner five guineas: The pri&s;oner &s;aid he could not take that, that was little more than two &s;hillings in the pound; then there was a good deal more talk about it: The pri&s;oner de&s;ired Little ne|ver to tru&s;t a Jew any more: Then he &s;aid Mr. Little mu&s;t give him &s;even guineas. Mr. Little &s;aid if he could &s;tay till Monday or Tue&s;|day he &s;hould have &s;even guineas, but he had not &s;o much then by him. I &s;ent to a friend of Mr. Little's to borrow &s;ix guineas: That friend came into the room and lent him the money; the pri&s;oner agreed to take five guineas, &s;aying, he better take that, than go to law; and &s;aid the Jew was in the King's Bench: The five gui|neas were laid down upon the table; the pri|&s;oner had a pocket-book in his hand, out of which he took the note, and gave it to me, and laid his hand upon the five guineas: This is the note, <HI>(produced in court)</HI> I took it up, and &s;aid this note is not indor&s;ed; how came you by this note not indor&s;ed? Said he, I would not give a halfpenny for an indor&s;ement of a Jew, I would not give a farthing for that: he de&s;i|red
<PB N="11" REF="013047_0008_0F953393BB93E460">
us always to look forwards, and not back|wards: I &s;aid to Mr. Little, take care that it is your own note: He &s;aid, it was not his note: I &s;aid, Mr. Little before you judge too ra&s;h, what kind of paper did you write your notes on? He &s;aid he bought a half-pennyworth &s;heet of writing paper, and wrote two 50l. notes; and the 100l. note likewi&s;e was wrote on the &s;ame &s;heet of paper: I &s;aid this is a forged note, this was torn out of a memorandum-book, for here is the ilot-holes where it had been &s;titch'd through: The pri&s;oner looking at me, &s;aid, A forged note! If the rogue has paid me a forged note, i'll pro&s;ecute him, let it co&s;t me what it will: I will go immediately to the King's Bench and have him taken up: I &s;aid to the pri&s;oner, I took you to be a gentleman, and a very human man, but I am afraid you are a villain: I put the note in my pocket-book, and Mr. Little took up the five guineas: Mr. Little &s;aid he &s;hould go before a magi&s;trate: Then the pri&s;oner put his hand to the wai&s;t|band of his breeches, and turned as if going to the door to make water: I followed him to the door: As &s;oon as he got to the door he pulled his cloths on one &s;ide and &s;et a runnng: I fol|lowed him a good many yards, perhaps two or three hundred yards; at la&s;t he turned up Chap|el-court, where Mr Little lives, and run up
<PB N="12" REF="013047_0009_0F953386B466A858">
into a corner, and offered to dodge me: I catched hold of him, when he was all of a tremble, and begged I would let him go home, and he would tell me how he came by the note: I told him he &s;hould not go home; that I &s;hould take him to the hou&s;e where he came from; and then he might tell Mr. Little how he came by it.</P>
<P>Going along, he told me he found it ju&s;t at the bottom of Ludgate-hill, by the Fleet market, in a memorandum-book: I &s;aid, Then why did you not tell us of it when you came? He &s;aid, nece&s;&s;ity obliged him to do as he had, he wan|ted a few guineas to carry him abroad: I took him into the hou&s;e again; and de&s;ired Mr. Little to go into the tap room, and I would &s;peak to the pri&s;oner: Then I &s;aid, he had bet|ter confe&s;s, if he had any concern with the Jew, as it would be better for him: He &s;aid, he did not know Levi the Jew; and that he actually found the note wrote in a memorandum-book, and begged I would let him go: I &s;aid, it was not in my power; I would a&s;k Mr. Little, if he would let me go, on condition he would a&s;&s;i&s;t me in getting my notes. He clapt his hand to his heart, and &s;aid, As he hoped to be &s;aved, he would come the next day. He gave me direction where to find him; which was, to enquire of Mr. Williams, Linnen-draper, in

Ratcliff-high-way. I called Mr. Little in, and a&s;ked him if he would let him go; he &s;aid he would not. We took him before major Spin|nage. When he came there, he would not tell his name, but denied that to be his name which he had wrote on the paper. When Mr. Little came to me, he told me, a gentleman that came fifteen miles out of London, had brought one of his notes.</P>

<P>On December the 7th, coming down Lud|gate-hill, at the corner of the Fleet-Market, I found a penny memorandum-book. It was doubled, and almo&s;t to pieces. I took it up in my hand, and went as far as Mr. Garaway's, a friend of mine that keeps a &s;eed-&s;hop in Fleet-&s;treet, with the book in my hand. I &s;aid to
<PB N="15" REF="013047_0012_0F953397863A5470">
Mrs. Garaway, Madam, I have picked up a memorandum-book; what is in it I can't tell; I have ju&s;t opened it; whether they are bank notes, or what. There is &s;omething in it. I pre&s;ented it to her, after I had read this note. She took the book and opened it, and looked at it read it, and gave it me again. After that Mr. Garaway came in; he likewi&s;e &s;aw the book and read the note: after that I put it in my pocket, and finding at the bottom it was directed to Thomas Little, Oxford-Chappel-Court, Cavendi&s;h-Square, I thought I would go and a&s;k him if he had real value for that note. It was made payable to I&s;aac Levi, whom I never &s;aw. I looked upon it that it was the property of I&s;aac Levi, and not Mr. Little; therefore I thought in ju&s;tice it &s;hould be returned to Thomas Little again, if he had not received value for it, and leaving it to his genero&s;ity to give me what he plea|&s;ed. I went to Mr. Little on the 12th of De|cember, and knocking at the door, he came him&s;elf. I a&s;ked him his name, and if he had not given a note of hand to I&s;aac Levi, a Jew, for 50l. value, payable at four months? he &s;aid, I have. I &s;aid, Sir, have you had value for it? He &s;aid he had not; he told me he had given two notes, and had had no value for them, and that he would not pay them
<PB N="16" REF="013047_0013_0F953397ECE8B828">
when they became due. I &s;aid, You need not make your&s;elf unea&s;y about it. He &s;aid he was bu&s;y in chri&s;tening a child, and de&s;ired me to call in the evening; and accord|ingly I went. I pau&s;ed in my own mind, that as he had not received value for it, I would return the note; leaving it to him to give me what he plea&s;ed. When I came, &s;ome conver|&s;ation aro&s;e: he &s;aid he &s;hould not pay it, for he had not had value. I believe I did &s;ay, That might not make any e&s;&s;ential difference, for whoever has given value for it, will de|mand the money of you. He &s;aid he &s;hould not pay. I &s;aid, very well. Upon this I did imagine there would be nothing more &s;aid. He &s;aid, Sir, you don't &s;eem willing to part with it, what will you have for it? I &s;aid, How could he think I &s;hould take any thing for a note not endor&s;ed? I &s;aid, I do not a&s;k a farthing, I leave it to you. He &s;aid, I &s;hould be willing to give you &s;omething for it. Upon which he &s;aid, what will you have? I &s;aid, I &s;hall leave it to you. Then they both whi&s;pered. I &s;aid, Do not whi&s;per, as though you was afraid of &s;aying &s;omething be|fore me; you are at liberty to go out and agree between your&s;elves, and that &s;hall be the thing. They went out, and came in again&punc; Then Mr. Hall agreed that Mr. Little &s;hould give
<PB N="17" REF="013047_0014_0F953398B4528FD0">
me five guineas, believing it to be Mr. Lit|tle's own note. I believe I might &s;ay, that was very little for a 50l. note I &s;aid I &s;hall leave it to you intirely. I never in&s;i&s;ted on any more than what they propo&s;ed to give me. Upon which they propo&s;ed then five guineas afterwards. They came to a determination to rai&s;e the five guineas, and five guineas were laid down upon the table. Then they a&s;ked me, If I had the note? I took it out of my pocket-book. Mr Little &s;aid, If it is my note, it is wrote Thomas. I then reply'd, Mr. Lit|tle, it is, and I believe it is your's. He &s;aid, it is dated October 10th, believing it to be his own note. I laid it down and put my hand upon one of the guineas. Said Mr. Hall to Mr. Little, are you &s;ure this is your own hand writing? Mr. Little then &s;aid, his note was wrote upon a longer piece of paper. I then declared that I found it afterwards. They be|gan to u&s;e me very roughly. My &s;pirit was up, and in&s;tead of owning my name, when they &s;aid it was a forged note, I was in a con&s;terna|tion about its falling into my hands, and wrote Williams on that paper. The di&s;pute ro&s;e pretty high, and they called names: I re&s;ent|ed it, and upon that con&s;ideration I did not tell them where I lived; neither did I tell them my name that night. If I &s;aid any thing

about &s;even guineas, it was leaving it to his genero&s;ity to give what he plea&s;ed. I found words aro&s;e &s;o high, that I expected they would terminate in blows; and &s;o when I was out of the hou&s;e I walked off.

I &s;aid, if it was of any concern, it would be adverti&s;ed in a few days, and if not, he had better ad|verti&s;e it. I looked at it: I remember it was &s;igned by one Thomas Little for 50l. <HI>(He takes the note in his hand.)</HI> I do not think this is the note. I think that note was wrote in a wor&s;e hand a great deal, and on a larger piece of paper.</P>

<P>What &s;ort of a memorandum-book was it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Garaway.</SPEAKER>
<P>It had a marble cover. It was ra|ther thiner than a common memorandum book, but of the &s;ame kind. The note was wrote on one of the leaves, not &s;eparated, to the be&s;t of my knowledge</P>

<P>My acquaintance with Mr. Allen is but &s;mall: I have known him about a year. I know but very little of his charac|ter; all I know is, this is not his hand-writing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peter A&s;hmore.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not come to his cha|racter. I heard Mr. Hall &s;ay, he believed the note was not Mr. Allen's hand-writing.</P>

<P>I come only in re&s;pect to Mr. Allen's hand-writing. This is not his hand-writing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is his general character?</P>

<SPEAKER>Davis.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have known him &s;ome years. I never heard him to be guilty of &s;uch an action.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q</SPEAKER>
<P>Is his character a good one?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Davis.</SPEAKER>
<P>So far it is.</P>

<SPEAKER>Thomas Lee.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have known him about four years: he was a preacher in <HI>Petticoat-Lane</HI> once. I know nothing of his character. I heard Mr. Little &s;ay, he believed the note was not the pri&s;oner's hand-writing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Richard White.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have known the pri&s;oner between four and five years.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is his general character?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>White.</SPEAKER>
<P>To me his character is as good as any man's in England, and I would have tru&s;ted him with any thing that fell in my Way.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>After the foregoing Evidences were duly examined Mr. ALLEN was Acquitted.</HI></P>
