<HEAD>THE CASE Of the People called QUAKERS In the Province of PENNSYLVANIA, With re&s;pect to the Forms of Declara|tion of Fidelity to the King, and of Affirmation, lately granted to their Friends in <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> &amp;c. by Acts of Parliament, briefly &s;tated and humbly offer'd to the Con&s;ideration of the Governour and Council of the &s;aid Province.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the late King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second favouring the good Purpo&s;e of our late Proprietary <HI>William Penn,</HI> and ha|ving Regard to the Memory and Merits of his decea&s;ed Father, in

<P>After the Proprietary's rea&s;&s;uming his Government, the Laws were re|vi&s;ed in 1700 and 1701, and this a|bout the manner of giving Evidence, with divers others, were remitted to the Queen and Council in 1705, and was referr'd to the Con&s;ideration of <HI>Northy,</HI> then Attorney General, who did not object to the Form of Words, or legal Effect of Solemnly Promi|&s;ing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in&s;tead of an Oath, or o|ther Affirmation, but his Opinion was to repeal the &s;aid Act, becau&s;e the Puni&s;hment of Wilfully Fal&s;ify|ing that Solemn Promi&s;e, was exten|ded further than the Law of <HI>Eng|land</HI> required, which thereupon was repeal'd accordingly.</P>
<P>Our Friends continued in the En|joyment of this Fundamental Right

<P>And it is evident, that the King and Parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> are of the &s;ame Opinion concerning us in this Ca&s;e, otherwi&s;e after an Ex|perience of Twenty-five Years, they would not &s;o generally accept our Solemn Promi&s;e in &s;o important a Matter as a Te&s;t of our Allegiance and Fidelity to the King, and for abjuring the Pretender, at a Time when new Engagements are required of other Subjects in the &s;ame Ca&s;es; And therefore, we hope our Fellow-Subjects will Acquie&s;ce in the &s;ame Security, and not affect a great Dif|fidence than our Superiours.
