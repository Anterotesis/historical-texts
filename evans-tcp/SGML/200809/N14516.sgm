<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>BENEVOLENCE is that quality, in the human mind, without which we could not be the objects of one another's e&s;teem: Neither, were we wholly de&s;titute of it, could we, whatever other qualities we might be endowed with, place that confidence in each other, upon which the well-being of the world, in &s;o great a mea&s;ure, depends. Were we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of power, but no benevolence, it would operate in tyranny; were we the &s;ubjects of wi&s;dom, but no be|nevolence, it would be nothing better than craft: And the higher we enjoyed the&s;e properties in degree, the greater rea&s;on we &s;hould have, had we, at the &s;ame time, no benevolence, to &s;hun one another through fear of mi&s;chief. It is <HI>benevolence,</HI> tempering our other qualities, and making way for their exerci&s;e in the methods of kindne&s;s, that con&s;titutes us worthy objects of each other's love, and lays the foundation for that mutual tru&s;t between man and man, without which there could be no &s;uch thing as public happi|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>And this ob&s;ervation, extended to all other crea|ted intelligent agents, is equally true: Yea, it is &s;o far true, with re&s;pect even to the uncreated Supreme Being him&s;elf, as that, if we had no idea of him as <HI>benevolent,</HI> we could not <HI>e&s;teem</HI> him, though we might fear him: Neither could we place our <HI>tru&s;t</HI> in him, though we might in a &s;ervile way, do homage to him. <HI>Benevolence</HI> is that ingredient in his cha|racter which exhibits him to our view as <HI>amiably</HI> perfect, and worthy of our warme&s;t love, and in|tire confidence. His other attributes, &s;eperate from
<PB N="iv" REF="018397_0003_0FA70C90B8512CE0">
this, are in&s;ufficient to in&s;pire the&s;e affections; nor are they indeed at all &s;uited to &s;uch a purpo&s;e. "Eternity and immen&s;ity amaze our thoughts: Infinite know|ledge and wi&s;dom fill us with admiration: Omnipo|tence, or irre&s;i&s;table power, is great and adorable; but, at the &s;ame time, if con&s;idered &s;imply by it&s;elf, 'tis al&s;o dreadful and terrible: Dominion and ma|je&s;ty, clothed with perfect and impartial ju&s;tice, is worthy of our highe&s;t prai&s;es; but &s;till to <HI>&s;inners</HI> it ap|pears rather awful and venerable, than the object of de&s;ire and love: Holine&s;s and purity are inexpre&s;&s;ibly beautiful and amiable perfections, but of too bright a glory for &s;inners to contemplate with delight. Tis good|ne&s;s that fini&s;hes the idea of <HI>God,</HI> and repre&s;ents him to us under the lovely character of the <HI>be&s;t</HI> as well as greate&s;t Being in the univer&s;e. This is that attri|bute, which both in it&s;elf is infinitely amiable, and, as a ground-work interwoven with all the other per|fections of the Divine Nature, makes every one of them al&s;o to become objects of our love, as well as of our admiration. Immen&s;e and eternal goodne&s;s, goodne&s;s all-powerful and all-wi&s;e, goodne&s;s inve&s;ted with &s;upreme dominion, and tempering the rigor of unrelenting ju&s;tice: This is indeed the de&s;cription of a Perfect Being; a character truely worthy of God."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Clark's &s;ermons.</NOTE></P>
<P>But though <HI>Benevolence</HI> thus e&s;&s;entially enters into the character of the <HI>Deity,</HI> it has been objected to by &s;ome, and abu&s;ed by others. And it may be, more objections have been levelled again&s;t, and great|er reproaches ca&s;t upon, this attribute of the Divine Nature, than any of the other; though it is, in it|&s;elf,
<PB N="v" REF="018397_0004_0FA70C91952548C8">
the mo&s;t lovely of all the perfections of God, and eminently that perfection, which, being intimately conjoined with the re&s;t, in all their exerci&s;es, is the true and only &s;ource of all created exi&s;tence, and de|pendent happine&s;s, whether in pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or fu|ture pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to &s;ome, their abu&s;es of the Divine <HI>benevolence</HI> don't &s;o much &s;pring from any di&s;tinct notions they have formed of the nature of this prin|ciple, as exi&s;ting in the <HI>Deity</HI>; or the methods, in which they conclude it ought to operate, as from a <HI>wrong &s;tate of mind.</HI> They are di&s;&s;atisfied with their &s;ituation in the world, and quite out of humour, becau&s;e they don't partake &s;o liberally of the good things of providence, as they imagine they might do. And their di&s;content is &s;till heightened if they meet with di&s;appointments, and are reduced to &s;uffering circum&s;tances, though by their own folly. And be|ing out of frame, unea&s;y and re&s;tle&s;s in their &s;pirits, they find fault with their Maker, and vent them&s;elves in reflections on his goodne&s;s; as though it were great|ly defective: Otherwi&s;e, as they imagine, a more advantageous condition in life might have been allot|ed to them; and would have been, if the <HI>Deity</HI> had been as good as they can &s;uppo&s;e him to be. The&s;e are the complaints, by which the infinitely benevolent Creator, and Governor, of all things, is abu&s;ed by the le&s;s knowing and inqui&s;itive, who are the mo&s;t numerous: But, as their complaints don't &s;o much originate in <HI>judgment,</HI> as a <HI>bad temper of mind,</HI> this chiefly needs to be rectified, and then their complaints will cea&s;e of cour&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="018397_0005_0FA70C9236F2AA68">There are others, who&s;e <HI>objections</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Divine Benevolence</HI> ari&s;es from a <HI>vain mind,</HI> proudly a&s;pi|ring to comprehend that which is above the reach of their capacities. Some appearances, in the con&s;titu|tion of nature, and government of providence, are &s;uch as they can't account for, upon the plan of <HI>in|finite benevolence.</HI> They find them&s;elves unable to connect the&s;e, with other appearances, &s;o as to con|&s;titute an <HI>whole</HI> which they di&s;tinctly and particularly perceive to be an <HI>ab&s;olutely good</HI> one, free'd from all difficulties: And they are therefore rather di&s;po&s;ed to di&s;pute the exi&s;tence of an <HI>infinitely perfect</HI> principle of benevolence, than to call in que&s;tion their own capacity to &s;ee through the whole of its operations: Though, if there be &s;uch a principle, it mu&s;t be employed about the <HI>univer&s;al &s;y&s;tem</HI> of things; and, for that rea&s;on, require an under&s;tanding, in order to adju&s;t its exerci&s;es, that can take in connections, and dependencies, va&s;tly tran&s;cending the mo&s;t enlarged conceptions of &s;uch im|perfect creatures as we are. Nothing can be &s;uf|ficient to &s;atisfy &s;uch objectors, till they have fir&s;t learnt to be mode&s;t; entertaining ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions of their own weakne&s;s, and the un&s;earchable <HI>great|ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> of <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>There are yet others, who&s;e <HI>objections</HI> again&s;t, and <HI>abu&s;es</HI> of, the <HI>benevolence</HI> of the <HI>Deity,</HI> take ri&s;e from their <HI>mi&s;conceptions</HI> of the nature of this Divine attribute. Having formed to them&s;elves <HI>wrong</HI> apprehen&s;ions of &s;upreme ab&s;olute benevolence, and the methods of its di&s;play, they either <HI>deny</HI> that <HI>God</HI> is thus benevolent, becau&s;e &s;ome detached ap|pearances

<P>Some there be who &s;eem to have no other idea of <HI>ab&s;olutely perfect benevolence,</HI> than an <HI>uncon|controulable impul&s;ive principle, nece&s;&s;arily</HI> ur|ging on to the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> communication of <HI>good,</HI> and the total prevention of evil; its prevention &s;o as that it &s;hould have no place in the creation, in any &s;hape, or view what&s;oever: And the con&s;titution of nature, not falling in with this notion of goodne&s;s, they que&s;tion the reality of any principle of benevolence: Not con&s;i|dering that benevolence if &s;eated in an infinitely perfect mind, like <HI>God's,</HI> is never exerted blindly, or <HI>nece&s;|&s;arily,</HI> but always under the conduct of rea&s;on and wi&s;|dom: Which thought ju&s;tly pur&s;ued, will &s;ufficient|ly account for all appearances, however &s;eemingly in|con&s;i&s;tent with goodne&s;s; as we may have occa&s;ion to &s;hew hereafter, in its proper place: Whereas, a principle of benevolence, thou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h of <HI>infinite propel|ling force,</HI> if not guided in its operations by <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>intelligence,</HI> in&s;tead of producing <HI>nothing but good,</HI> might, by blindly counteracting it&s;elf, produce, upon the <HI>whole,</HI> as the final re&s;ult of its exertions, infinite confu&s;ion and di&s;order.</P>
<P>The effect of <HI>mi&s;taken</HI> notions of Divine Goodne&s;s, in others, is, not their denying that <HI>God</HI> is good, in|finitely good, but &s;peaking <HI>reproachfully</HI> of this

attribute of his nature. And, perhaps, the reflecti|ons which have been ca&s;t upon the benevolence of the <HI>Deity,</HI> from this cau&s;e, have been equally <HI>malig|nant</HI> with a total denyal of it, and done as much di&s;&s;ervice to the intere&s;t of true religion, and real vir|tue, in the world. A m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re &s;hocking idea can &s;carce be given of the <HI>Deity,</HI> than that which repre&s;ents him as <HI>arbitrarily dooming the greater part of the race of men to eternal mi&s;ery.</HI> Was he whol|ly de&s;titute of goodne&s;s, yea, po&s;itively <HI>malevolent</HI> in his nature, a wor&s;e repre&s;entation could not be well made of him. And yet, this is the true import of the doctrine of <HI>ab&s;olute and unconditional re|probation,</HI> as it has been taught, even by tho&s;e who profe&s;s faith in <HI>God</HI> as a <HI>benevolent,</HI> yea, an <HI>infi|nitely benevolent Being</HI>: But they could not have taught this doctrine, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible, if they had not fir&s;t entertained <HI>intirely wrong</HI> concep|tions of benevolence, as attributed to the <HI>Deity.</HI> 'Tis indeed &s;trange that any, who feel within them&s;elves the working of kind affection, &s;hould give in to an opinion &s;o reproachful to the Father of mercies. To be &s;ure their ideas of goodne&s;s in <HI>God,</HI> if they have any, mu&s;t be totally different from all the ideas we have of goodne&s;s, as we apply the term to <HI>our&s;elves,</HI> or any created intelligent agent what&s;oever. And if their ideas are th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s different, and may con&s;equently &s;ignify the &s;ame thing with what we call <HI>cruelty</HI> in men, or any other creatures endowed with moral agency, they can really mean nothing when they &s;ay, that God is good: And it is of no importance, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f not the lea&s;t &s;ignificancy, whether they call him good, or not.</P>

<HEAD><HI>PART I.</HI> Explaining Benevolence as attributed to the <HI>DEITY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing nece&s;&s;ary, in treating of <HI>Divine Benevolence</HI> is to a&s;certain the <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> in which this <HI>perfection</HI> is a&s;cribed to the <HI>Deity.</HI> In order whereto,</P>
<P>It may be proper to begin with fixing the <HI>general</HI> notion of goodne&s;s, as a <HI>moral</HI> attribute. And here we &s;hall meet with no great difficulty. We have clear and di&s;tinct ideas of this moral quality. 'Tis as readily perceived by the mind as any &s;en&s;ible quality what&s;oever, and as readi|ly di&s;tingui&s;hed from all others.</P>
<P>'A principle di&s;po&s;ing and prompting to the communication of happine&s;s,' is the fir&s;t idea that enters into its compo&s;ition. As there|fore <HI>perceiving</HI> beings only are capable of hap|pine&s;s, they only are the objects of goodne&s;s. Inanimate matter, 'tis true, in all its various forms, may <HI>pa&s;&s;ively</HI> be the occa&s;ion of happi|ne&s;s, to creatures that are either &s;en&s;ible, or in|telligent. And, upon this account, it may be con&s;idered as an object, about which goodne&s;s may be employed, and by means of which it may be manife&s;ted: Though, being void of
<PB N="12" REF="018397_0011_0FA70C9B735D9110">
perception, it cannot it&s;elf immediately be the object of goodne&s;s, becau&s;e an incapable &s;ubject of happine&s;s. But whatever beings are endow|ed with <HI>perception,</HI> as they are hereby rendered capable of happine&s;s, in an higher or lower de|gree, in proportion to their faculties, they are the proper objects of goodne&s;s: And goodne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in 'a di&s;po&s;ition to make them happy.'</P>
<P>'This di&s;po&s;ition al&s;o mu&s;t be exerted freely.' And hence it is that we don't attribute goodne&s;s, as a character, to the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ute creatures.</HI> Not that they exi&s;t without kind propen&s;ions, or that hap|pine&s;s to others, in various kinds, is not the ef|fect of their &s;everal exertions: But as the&s;e <HI>in|&s;tinctive</HI> principles are thrown into exerci&s;e by <HI>mechanical impul&s;e,</HI> we look upon the <HI>animals,</HI> in whom they are implanted, as in&s;truments only in the diffu&s;ion of good, not the <HI>moral cau&s;es</HI> of it. Communicated happine&s;s mu&s;t be the <HI>cho|&s;en act</HI> of &s;ome <HI>agent,</HI> otherwi&s;e we never con|&s;ider it as a <HI>moral quality,</HI> and call it <HI>commenda|ble</HI> goodne&s;s. Accordingly, the <HI>good man,</HI> is not a meer <HI>pa&s;&s;ive in&s;trument</HI> in the be&s;towment of good. Neither do we call a man <HI>good,</HI> tho' he does good, if it be be&s;ide his intenti|on, and by accident only. But he is the <HI>good man,</HI> and he only, who <HI>voluntarily</HI> acts for the benefit of others. His offices of kindne&s;s are the re&s;ult of <HI>free choice</HI>; and for this rea&s;on we apply good|ne&s;s to him, under the notion of a <HI>moral virtue.</HI></P>
<P>This di&s;po&s;ition mu&s;t al&s;o be exerted with a truly benevolent de&s;ign. We don't call that
<PB N="13" REF="018397_0012_0FA70C9C0D174D98">
man good, who&s;e actions may be productive of good to others, if it was be&s;ide his intention in doing them: Much le&s;s will he de&s;erve this cha|racter, if he did them with a view to &s;erve him|&s;elf only, not them. And, in&s;tead of benevolent, he will be quite the rever&s;e, if, in the in&s;tances wherein he manife&s;ts goodne&s;s to others, his de|&s;ign is to entrap and en&s;nare them; making u&s;e of that which has the appearance of intended kindne&s;s, as an enticement to lead them a&s;ide, and bring upon them &s;ome greater evil. A wor&s;e character can &s;carce be given a man. It is in|deed the character of that Being, who, of all Beings, is the mo&s;t malevolent.</P>
<P>In fine, 'this di&s;po&s;ition mu&s;t be exerci&s;ed under the guidance of <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> and in con&s;i&s;tency with <HI>right</HI> and <HI>fit</HI> conduct:' Nor otherwi&s;e do we con&s;ider it as a <HI>moral</HI> perfection. If we look within, and reflect upon our perceptions, we &s;hall find, that our idea of benevolence, as a <HI>commendable</HI> quality, is not a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> di&s;po&s;ition; but a di&s;po&s;ition exerci&s;ed under the conduct of <HI>&iuml;ntelligence,</HI> and within the limits of <HI>moral truth</HI> and right. Conformably whereto, experience teaches us, that we do'nt expect, that the man, we call benevolent, &s;hould act for ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> advantage without thought, and at random: We &s;hould e&s;teem &s;uch <HI>blind</HI> benevolence great weakne&s;s, and look upon the expre&s;&s;ions of it as little bet|ter than &s;o many in&s;tances of folly. Neither do we expect, that the benevolent man &s;hould do us kind offices, in contradiction to the known
<PB N="14" REF="018397_0013_0FA70C9CDC9C8A08">

<P>A natural di&s;po&s;ition then in the <HI>Deity,</HI> moving him to the communication of happine&s;s," is the fir&s;t ingredient in the notion of goodne&s;s as at|tributed to him.

<P>In order whereto, and to help us in forming the mo&s;t ju&s;t and honorable thoughts of benevo|lence, as a <HI>di&s;po&s;ition</HI> in <HI>God,</HI> it may be proper to ob&s;erve, that the two grand principles, in human nature, <HI>&s;elf-love</HI> and <HI>benevolence,</HI> the former de|termining us to <HI>private,</HI> the latter to <HI>public,</HI> good, are accompanied, each of them, with particular appetites and pa&s;&s;ions, &s;everally adapted to pro|mote the more effectual pro&s;ecution of the&s;e ends, as occa&s;ion may require: Nor &s;hould we have been &s;o well qualified to pur&s;ue ei|ther our <HI>own</HI> good, or the good of <HI>others,</HI> had it not been for the implantation of the&s;e ap|petites and pa&s;&s;ions, which are filled to ha&s;ten our exertments, and give them an additional force, an&s;werable to the &s;tate and circum&s;tances, we our&s;elves, or others, may be in. <HI>Self-love</HI> is a general, calm, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate principle; and would not, in a variety of ca&s;es, e&s;pecially con|&s;idering the &s;low progre&s;s we make in know|ledge, and the weakne&s;s of it at be&s;t, have been &s;ufficient, &s;ingly and alone, to put us up|on &s;eeking, or &s;hunning, with requi&s;ite &s;peed and vigor, the things nece&s;&s;ary to our own pre&s;ervation.

Thus, the helple&s;s &s;tate of children, requiring the con&s;tant care and patience of others, in mini&s;tring to their wants, a &s;trong affection is planted in the hearts of parents, di&s;po&s;ing them both to do, and bear, almo&s;t any thing for their advantage: Nor without this STORGEE is it conceivable, how they &s;hould &s;o often deny them&s;elves, and go through &s;o much toil and labour, for the &s;ake of their offspring: which yet their cir|cum&s;tances make ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. In like manner, the dangers mankind are liable to, and the difficulties, &s;orrows, and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, they meet with, &s;o often call for the &s;udden, vigo|rous exertment of &s;ome kind hand, that <HI>pity</HI> is an affection <HI>God</HI> has fixed in our nature: And to this it is owing, that we are &s;o readily mov|ed to activity, in proportion to the di&s;tre&s;s of the object pre&s;ented to our view.</P>

<P>The reply is, It is readily acknowledged, that to a <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> being, the <HI>rea&s;onablene&s;s</HI> of an ac|tion is a &s;ufficient excitement to it, and the on|ly one that is &s;o: But then I add, that no rea|&s;onable being can be &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t <HI>merely</HI> with the <HI>principles of rea&s;on,</HI> without any other ingredient in his nature. And if a <HI>con&s;titution of nature</HI> is previou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed, no action can have any <HI>rea&s;onablene&s;s</HI> in it, but in con&s;i&s;tency with this &s;uppo&s;ed nature. To apply this particular|ly to the <HI>Deity.</HI> If, when he is &s;poken of as a <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> being, nothing more is meant than his <HI>&s;imply</HI> exi&s;ting with the powers of <HI>intelligence</HI> and <HI>volition,</HI> it does not appear how he could have <HI>&s;een</HI> any action to be <HI>rea&s;onable,</HI> or cho&s;en it as &s;uch. <HI>Intelligence</HI> and <HI>volition,</HI> con&s;idered <HI>&s;imply,</HI> and as ab&s;tracted from all perception of happine&s;s, and connection with it, in any view what&s;oever, are really worthle&s;s powers, and can &s;erve for no manner of u&s;e: And the ca&s;e

would be the &s;ame, &s;hould we heighten them in <HI>degree,</HI> even to <HI>infinity.</HI> The being, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them, could have no excitement to action, but would eternally exi&s;t indifferent to every thing. The <HI>Deity</HI> therefore mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t with <HI>&s;entiments of happine&s;s,</HI> and a <HI>capacity</HI> for it, in addition to the powers of intelligence and volition, together with a <HI>natural &s;tate of mind inclining</HI> him to pur&s;ue it, either with re&s;pect to <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> or <HI>others,</HI> or <HI>both</HI>: And according to the idea we frame of his <HI>nature,</HI> in the&s;e re&s;pects, &s;o mu&s;t our ideas be of <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> action in him.

What exciting rea&s;on could he have to do it? 'Tis true, he might, from his all-compre|hen&s;ive under&s;tanding, perfectly know all the various ways in which creatures might be made, and con&s;tituted happy: But the de&s;ire of making them happy, not being &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>natural</HI> to him, this knowledge of his could have no tendency to put him upon acting for the procurement of

this end: Nor can it be &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>fit</HI> or <HI>rea&s;on|able</HI> that it &s;hould.

<P>This di&s;po&s;ition mu&s;t be exerted al&s;o with a nobly benevolent intention, not with a &s;e|cret, hidden view to make tho&s;e mi&s;erable, and with inhanced aggravation, who are the ob|jects of that which has the appearance of com|municated goodne&s;s. Some there are, who, though they call the Deity benevolent, yet, repre|&s;ent him as making &s;ome of his crea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">res, and

Yea, there are tho&s;e, who make the infinitely benevolent God the <HI>grand and only efficient,</HI> not only in the be&s;tow|ment of good, but even in the abu&s;e of it; and that he has &s;o laid his plan, and connected a chain of cau&s;es, as that this abu&s;e &s;hall invio|lably be brought into event, and on purpo&s;e that its final re&s;ult &s;hould be the everla&s;ting damnation of a great number of the creatures his hands have formed. Some late writers will not di&s;own, that this is a ju&s;t repre&s;enta|tion of their publi&s;hed &s;entiments. What their idea of benevolence is, I will not pretend to &s;ay; but this I will &s;ay, that it e&s;&s;entially dif|fers from that moral quality, which goes by the name of benevolence among men; and it mo&s;t cer|tainly would, in any created intelligent moral agent be deemed, not merely malevolence, but male|volence in the highe&s;t degree. And to attri|bute &s;uch benevolence to the all-perfect Deity, would be to make him, not con&s;tructively and by di&s;tant con&s;equence, but directly and in explicit terms, a more malevolent being than even the evil one has ever been repre&s;ented to be. For he is only a tempter to wicked|ne&s;s; but, according to this &s;cheme, the in|finitely good God is its <HI>efficient,</HI> its only <HI>pro|per cau&s;e,</HI> and in order to produce eternal mi|&s;ery

If he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that moral quality we call benevolence, he mu&s;t, if we can form any idea of what benevolence means, in all the manife&s;ta|tions of it to his creatures, intend their good, with|out any &s;ecret reference to the contrary; in|&s;omuch, that if they chu&s;e that to their hurt, which was truly de&s;igned for their good, they them&s;elves, and not the God that made them, and has been kind and good to them, are chargeable with the guilt and folly of their mi&s;conduct.</P>
<P>Finally, this di&s;po&s;ition in the <HI>Deity</HI> mu&s;t likewi&s;e be exerted 'under the <HI>direction of in|telligence,</HI> and in <HI>con&s;i&s;tency with fit conduct.</HI>' I &s;ay under the <HI>direction of intelligence,</HI> becau&s;e otherwi&s;e it would be that <HI>blind</HI> &s;ort of bene|volence which is really of no worth, <HI>morally</HI> &s;peaking.

<P>Some may be ready to think, that the <HI>will</HI> of the Supreme Being is the only mea&s;ure of <HI>fitne&s;s,</HI> in the communication of good; that what he <HI>wills</HI> is for that rea&s;on <HI>fit,</HI> and there is

<P>In the fir&s;t place, it is obvious to deduce, from the explanation that has been given of be|nevolence as a <HI>moral</HI> quality, a ju&s;t conception of the thing meant, when the Deity is &s;poken of as <HI>infinitely</HI> good. There may have been, in the minds of &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me, indi&s;tinct, if not wrong, appre|hen&s;ions of what is &s;ignified by this adjunct. The application of it, if applied intelligibly, is not intended to &s;ugge&s;t, that benevolence in|finite in degree is di&s;played in every commu|nication of goodne&s;s from the Deity. For it is evident to common &s;en&s;e, that the&s;e commu|nications are various; &s;ome manife&s;t goodne&s;s in one degree, others <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> another; and &s;o on, with incon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vable diver&s;ity. Neither is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed, be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e God is <HI>infinitely</HI> benevo|lent, that he has in fact made an infinite ma|nife&s;tation of his goodne&s;s. This, perhaps, is impo&s;&s;ible; and for this very good rea&s;on, becau&s;e <HI>infinity</HI> in benevolence knows no bounds, but there is &s;till room for more, and higher
<PB N="41" REF="018397_0040_0FA70CBD29F539E8">
di&s;plays of it. The true idea therefore of the epithet, <HI>infinite,</HI> when applied to God as benevo|lent, is, as I apprehend, plainly this; that he has within him&s;elf a boundle&s;s &s;ource of be|nevolence, that he is &s;o benevolent, in his na|ture, as that he may go on eternally making di&s;coveries of his goodne&s;s, or, in other words, that this perfection of his is, &s;trictly &s;peaking, inexhau&s;table, not capable of being exerted to a <HI>ne plus.</HI> It is ob&s;ervable, we do not &s;ay that God is almighty, omnipotent, becau&s;e he has exerted his power to the utmo&s;t; for he may go on exerting it without end; otherwi&s;e, he could not be &s;aid to be <HI>infinite</HI> in power. In the &s;ame &s;en&s;e God is <HI>infinitely</HI> benevolent. But then, as he is infinitely intelligent and wi&s;e, as well as benevolent, he never manife&s;ts either his power, or goodne&s;s, but under the guid|ance of intelligent wi&s;dom. Whatever this directs to, he wills &s;hall be; and whatever he wills &s;hall be, is actually brought into event. This points out the rea&s;on, and the true one, why God, though <HI>infinitely</HI> powerful and bene|volent in his nature, is yet under a limitation as to the di&s;play of tho&s;e attributes. He mani|fe&s;ts no more power, or goodne&s;s, than unerring wi&s;dom directs to: Nor could it be otherwi&s;e, unle&s;s the&s;e perfections were to be manife&s;ted blindly, and at random; the ab&s;urdity of which is too glaring to be &s;uppo&s;ed. This leads</P>
<P>To another obvious and important deduc|tion, which is, that no communications of
<PB N="42" REF="018397_0041_0FA70CBDB57424A0">
goodne&s;s may rea&s;onably be looked for from the Deity, though infinitely benevolent, but &s;uch as fall in with what wi&s;dom directs to, as fit and proper. We may plea&s;e our&s;elves, and too often do, with vain expectations, taking ri&s;e from fal&s;e ideas we have in our minds of infi|nite benevolence, as exi&s;ting in the brea&s;t of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d. But it ought to be remembered, and &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered, that the &s;ame Deity who is infinitely benevolent, is al&s;o infinitely intelli|gent, wi&s;e, ju&s;t, and holy, and cannot there|fore, unle&s;s with gro&s;s ab&s;urdity, be &s;uppo&s;ed to manife&s;t his benevolence in any acts of good|ne&s;s, but in harmony with tho&s;e perfections, all which are equally e&s;&s;ential ingredients in his nature. Many men are apt to imagine, that God is all goodne&s;s, and that they may hope for every thing from this attribute of his, without &s;o much as once thinking h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w unrea|&s;onable, and unfit it would be in an infinitely intelligent, wi&s;e, and ju&s;t being to make di&s;plays of his benevolence in any in&s;tances, or degrees, but under the guidance of wi&s;dom, and in per|fect con&s;i&s;tency with rectitude. What are our &s;entiments of tho&s;e good-natured, kindly affec|tioned men, who di&s;pen&s;e their bounties, not with under&s;tanding and wi&s;dom, but in a ran|dom way, without thought or con&s;ideration? We pity their weakne&s;s, and wi&s;h they had more di&s;cretion. And &s;hall we attribute that to the all-perfect Deity, which we e&s;teem a di&s;grace even in man! Benevolence, though infinite in

its &s;ource, or principle, mu&s;t yet be limited, re|&s;trained, and governed in all its manife&s;tations, by wi&s;dom, equity, and ju&s;tice, or it may, in the final re&s;ult of its operations, do more hurt, than good; to be &s;ure, it will not otherwi&s;e bring honor to the being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, if, at the &s;ame time, he is &s;uppo&s;ed to be endowed with intelligence and wi&s;dom, in a &s;ufficient degree, for his direction in the di&s;plays of his goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>Another deduction &s;till, highly intere&s;ting and important, is, that intelligent moral beings have no ju&s;t ground, from the infinite bene|volence of God, to expect the enjoyment of that happine&s;s they are made capable of, but in con|&s;equence of, or connection with, a wi&s;e and virtuous u&s;e of their implanted powers, under &s;uch advantages as they may be favored with. The rea&s;on is, becau&s;e God, though he has with|in him&s;elf an infinite, never-failing &s;pring of benevolence, yet will not &s;uffer it to flow from him, in any in&s;tance or degree, but under the guidance of wi&s;dom that cannot err. And can it be thought wi&s;e or fit, that moral agents, whether they are virtuous or vicious, without regard had to their re&s;pective oppo&s;ite charac|ters, &s;hould be indi&s;criminately treated as &s;ui|table objects of the Divine benevolence? How would &s;uch a conduct comport with the de|&s;ign of heaven in the be&s;towment of intellec|tual and moral powers? To what purpo&s;e were they given, if it was a matter of indiffe|rency, in relation to their being fit objects of
<PB N="44" REF="018397_0043_0FA70CC0A7848420">
their Maker's kind notice, how they employed them? And how could even the&s;e moral be|ings them&s;elves, entertain in their minds, be|coming conceptions of the wi&s;dom and recti|tude of the Supreme Creator and Ruler, upon this plan of manife&s;ting his benevolence? Be&s;ides, it may be ju&s;tly que&s;tioned, whether moral agents can be made truly happy, but by a wi&s;e and right u&s;e of their implanted facul|ties. The goodne&s;s of God, under the direc|tion of wi&s;dom, has given them various fa|culties, and placed them within reach of ob|jects fitted to yield them the enjoyment, they were formed capable of; but if they will &s;eek for happine&s;s in other ways, and not in this, which a good God has purpo&s;ely adapted to give it to them, how &s;hould they be the &s;ub|jects of it? It cannot be. There mu&s;t be an agreement between faculties and objects, and a due application al&s;o of the&s;e faculties to their re&s;pective objects, or there can be no proper &s;a|tisfaction. It is indeed impo&s;&s;ible there &s;hould be, according to the pre&s;ent con&s;tituted way of enjoyment. The nature therefore of intellec|tual moral beings mu&s;t be changed into &s;ome other, or they mu&s;t, in a mea&s;ure, act up to their character as p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing this nature; other|wi&s;e, they can no more enjoy the happine&s;s pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">per to this kind of beings, than righteou&s;|ne&s;s can have fellow&s;hip with unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, or light have communion with darkne&s;s."</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="018397_0044_0FA70CC25824F820">I have hitherto con&s;idered this deduction on|ly in general, as it re&s;pects all intelligent mo|ral beings, in all worlds. But it may, with pertinency be applied more particularly to us men, as containing that in it which is well worthy of our mo&s;t &s;erious attention. We are formed by the God that made us, not only with animal, but intellectual and moral faculties; in which view of our con&s;titution, we have nothing to expect, in a way of favorable no|tice, from the Deity, though infinitely bene|volent, but what is &s;uited to the faculties, he has given us, and to be enjoyed only in con|nection with, or in con&s;equence of, a due and proper u&s;e of them. Was benevolence in God a propen&s;ity in his nature, of the in&s;tinctive kind, blindly urging him on to a gratification of it, it might be done at any rate: But, far from this, it is a di&s;po&s;ition inhering in an all-perfect mind, and that is in&s;eparably conjoined with infinite knowledge and wi&s;dom, and can therefore be never manife&s;ted <HI>ad extra</HI> but with rea&s;on, and in con&s;i&s;tency with rectitude.

<P>It may with propriety be added here, that the Supreme Being him&s;elf, as he is an intelligent moral agent in ab&s;olute perfection, is infinitely happy from the delight he takes in always chu&s;ing, willing, and doing, and with perfect freedom, that which is right and fit. And as he has made us men with intellectual and moral powers, after the &s;imili|tude of his own, though in a low degree, he has planted a capacity in our nature of being hap|py with the like kind of happine&s;s, he him&s;elf exi&s;ts in the enjoyment of.

And I &s;ee not, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, but that may be offered in this way of rea&s;oning which is &s;trictly conclu&s;ive. We may be as &s;ure, from the exerci&s;e of that power of di&s;cernment we are naturally endowed with, of the perfect benevolence of the Divine Being, as of his exi&s;tence, or of any of the per|fections we connect with it. The &s;ame intel|lectual power that a&s;&s;ures us there mu&s;t be an eternal &s;elf-exi&s;tent Deity, a&s;&s;ures us al&s;o, and in the &s;ame way, that he mu&s;t be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, not of this or that perfection only, but of every perfection. For, having always exi&s;ted with|out any exterior cau&s;e to limit his exi&s;tence, ei|ther as to its nature, manner, or properties, there is, and mu&s;t be, preci&s;ely the &s;ame rea|&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e him the &s;ubject of all perfecti|ons, as of any one in particular. Benevolence, therefore, &s;upremely perfect benevolence, is as ju&s;tly applicable to him&punc; as immen&s;ity, &s;pi|rituality, omnipotence, or any of the Divine attributes, to which the epithet, <HI>natural,</HI> is commonly applied, to di&s;tingui&s;h them fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m

<PB N="53" REF="018397_0051_0FA70CCA81E2C5D8">
and the &s;ame may be &s;aid, and with equal truth, of his all-perfect benevolence. Do we attribute almighty power to God, from the ef|fects of power he has produced? And &s;hall we not conceive of him as perfectly benevolent, from the effects of his goodne&s;s we every where &s;ee in our world, and in all parts of the uni|ver&s;e we have any knowledge of? How num|berle&s;s are the creatures he has formed with capacities of enjoyment? How amazingly va|rious are the&s;e capacities? What abundant pro|vi&s;ion has he made for filling them with the good that is &s;uited to their re&s;pective natures? And how immen&s;e is the quantum of good en|joyed by them all, con&s;idered in one collective view? Every creature we ca&s;t our eyes upon, di&s;covering plea&s;ure in its exi&s;tence, from the good it is made capable of enjoying, and actu|ally does enjoy, is, at once, both an in&s;tance, and proof, of the Divine benevolence. How inconceivably is this evidence increa&s;ed in its &s;trength, when &s;uch multitudes of beings in the creation of God, the number of which no man can count, have been, through a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, and &s;till are, the percipi|ents of his bountiful care, and munificent good|ne&s;s! Can any one, in the &s;ober exerci&s;e of his under&s;tanding, que&s;tion, whether this is a clear proof of benevolence in the Deity? E&s;pecial|ly, when there has been the di&s;play of &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing &s;kill and contrivance in the formati|on of faculties, and the making and placing
<PB N="54" REF="018397_0052_0FA70CCC3846E410">
objects within the reach of them, &s;o admirably &s;uited to yield them delight, and in ways and degrees beyond conception various. Who can help, in this view of things, breaking forth in &s;ome &s;uch words of admiration as tho&s;e of pious David, "Thou, Lord, art good, and d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t good! Thy tender mercies are over all the works of thy hands!"</P>
<P>But, as it is a matter of no &s;mall importance, that we entertain in our minds lively concepti|ons of the benevolence of the Deity, I &s;hall be particular and di&s;tinct in mentioning &s;ome of tho&s;e effects of it, which mu&s;t, unle&s;s we are greatly faulty in the u&s;e of our intellectual powers, oblige us to confe&s;s, that God is good, &s;upremely and perfectly good.</P>
<P>Only, before I enter upon this argument, and in order to clear the way to it, I de&s;ire the follow|ing remarks may be previou&s;ly well con&s;idered.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is, That this &s;y&s;tem of our's is not to be con&s;idered <HI>&s;ingly,</HI> and by <HI>it&s;elf,</HI> when we are arguing about the benevolence of the <HI>Deity.</HI> And for this plain rea&s;on, becau&s;e there are <HI>other</HI> &s;y&s;tems of beings, to whom <HI>God</HI> has made manife&s;tations of his goodne&s;s. If we may de|pend upon the <HI>bible,</HI> as a &s;acred book, there are certainly <HI>other</HI> beings, capable of happi|ne&s;s, and in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, be&s;ides tho&s;e which dwell on this earth. Nay, more than this, their capacities for happine&s;s are <HI>much larger,</HI> than the capacities of any of the beings belonging to this &s;y&s;tem; and they actually en|joy

it, in a <HI>much higher</HI> degree. But if any &s;hould e&s;teem this a con&s;ideration of little weight, I would add, there are &s;o many globes vi&s;ible to our &s;ight, equally capable; with this globe we live upon, of containing inhabitants&punc; furni&s;hed with &s;entiments of happine&s;s, and means of obtaining it, that it is, without all doubt, the truth of <HI>fact,</HI> that they are filled with &s;uch inhabitants. With re&s;pect to our earth, we certainly know, that it has relation to <HI>life</HI> and <HI>enjoyment.</HI> It is indeed &s;o con&s;tituted as to &s;upport in <HI>being</HI> and <HI>happine&s;s</HI> innumera|ble animated creatures of various kinds. And why &s;hould the other globes, revolving in the &s;ame heavens, be looked upon as <HI>meer dead mat|ter?</HI> We have infinitely greater rea&s;on, from what we &s;ee to be <HI>fact,</HI> in our own globe, to &s;up|po&s;e that they al&s;o are &s;o formed as to be &s;ub|&s;ervient to the pre&s;ervation of numberle&s;s <HI>percei|ving</HI> beings, to the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nor of the Creator's mu|nificence. The all-powerful, and infinitely wi&s;e, God could as ea&s;ily have modelled the other globes to the purpo&s;es of maintaining <HI>life,</HI> and rendering it comfortable, and happy, to milli|ons of creatures, as he has done this: And the thought that he has actually &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ade and contrived the other globes, in the heavens, is perfectly anal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gous to what we behold of his goodne&s;s, with re&s;pect to our own &s;y&s;tem: It is indeed the mo&s;t obvious and natural inference, from the con&s;ideration of him as a <HI>benevolent,</HI> as well as powerful and wi&s;e Being.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="018397_0054_0FA70CCED9B281A8">If now we are naturally led, from <HI>known ap|pearances,</HI> to argue, that there are <HI>other</HI> beings be&s;ides tho&s;e on this gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">be; and that this globe, with all the animate and intelligent beings dwel|ling on it, is only <HI>one</HI> of the &s;y&s;tems that has been produced by the infinitely benevolent cau&s;e of all things, the con&s;equence is plain, viz. that this world of our's ought to be con|&s;idered as only a <HI>part</HI> of &s;ome <HI>great whole,</HI> about which the <HI>benevolence</HI> of the <HI>Deity</HI> is employed.

And it is enough to illu&s;trate the <HI>real be|ing</HI> of an <HI>ab&s;olutely perfect</HI> principle of bene|volence, if the di&s;plays of it towards our world, one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f the con&s;tituent parts of this wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le, are clearly di&s;cerned to contain <HI>as much good</HI> as can rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to fall to our &s;hare.</P>
<P>A <HI>&s;econd</HI> remark though not very foreign from the former, is, that, in arguing concerning the <HI>Divine Benevolence,</HI> we ought not to con&s;ider its <HI>di&s;plays</HI> as they affect <HI>individual beings only,</HI> but as they relate to the <HI>particular &s;y&s;tem</HI> of which they are parts. For, as all <HI>particular &s;y&s;tems</HI> are, pro|bably, related to &s;ome <HI>univer&s;al one,</HI> and, pro|perly &s;peaking, are &s;o many <HI>parts</HI> con&s;tituting this <HI>great whole,</HI> de&s;igned, by the <HI>Deity,</HI> for the <HI>full</HI> manife&s;tation of his <HI>infinitely perfect</HI> bene|volence: In like manner, the &s;everal beings, in any <HI>particular</HI> &s;y&s;tem, are the <HI>parts</HI> con&s;titu|ting <HI>that</HI> a <HI>particular whole</HI>: And the Divine benevolence therefore, is to be e&s;timated from its amount to <HI>this whole,</HI> and not its con&s;titu|ent <HI>parts,</HI> &s;eparately con&s;idered. The&s;e, it is true, mu&s;t partake of good; but then, the good lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ked for ought to be no other than is pro|per to <HI>parts,</HI> bearing &s;uch a relation to &s;uch a <HI>whole.</HI></P>
<P>To be &s;ure, the only fair way of judging of the Divine benevolence, with re&s;pect to our world, is to con&s;ider it, not as di&s;played to <HI>&s;eparate individuals,</HI> but to the <HI>whole &s;y&s;tem,</HI> and to <HI>the&s;e</HI> as its con&s;tituent <HI>parts.</HI> For it is true in <HI>fact,</HI> that the <HI>Deity</HI> originally made, and

con&s;tantly governs, all the various kinds of be|ings, on this earth, and all the individuals in each of the&s;e kinds, with a <HI>relative</HI> view. He con&s;iders them not &s;imply as &s;o many <HI>kinds</HI> of beings, much le&s;s as &s;o many <HI>&s;ingle individuals,</HI> but as <HI>parts</HI> con&s;tituting &s;uch a <HI>particular &s;y&s;|tem</HI> in the univer&s;e. We therefore find, that the <HI>individuals</HI> in every <HI>kind</HI> are wi&s;ely and va|riou&s;ly related to each other; and not only &s;o, but the <HI>kinds them&s;elves</HI> are, in like manner, related to one another, &s;o as to be <HI>parts</HI> pro|perly fitted to fill up this <HI>&s;y&s;tem,</HI> and con&s;ti|tute it a <HI>good particular whole.</HI> And, accord|ingly, our ideas of the Creator, as <HI>benevolent,</HI> are to be fetched from the di&s;coveries he has made of goodne&s;s to the &s;y&s;tem made up of the&s;e <HI>parts,</HI> and not to any of the <HI>parts</HI> as de|tached from the &s;y&s;tem to which they are re|lated. And, in this way of judging of the in|finitely benevolent <HI>Deity,</HI> no more good is to be expected from him, with re&s;pect to any <HI>&s;pe|cies</HI> of beings, or any <HI>individuals</HI> in the&s;e &s;pe|cies, than is rea&s;onably con&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>good</HI> of the <HI>whole &s;y&s;tem,</HI> of which they are <HI>parts.</HI> And, if there appears to be the manife&s;tation of <HI>&s;o much</HI> goodne&s;s towards them as might rea&s;onably be expected for <HI>&s;uch parts,</HI> bearing &s;uch a relation to a <HI>good whole,</HI> it is all the good|ne&s;s that can be expected from benevolence, though <HI>infinite,</HI> if, at the &s;ame time, it is <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>rea&s;onable.</HI></P>

<P>The&s;e are all unque&s;tionable <HI>facts.</HI> And the con&s;equence from them is another <HI>fact</HI> as indi&s;putable, viz. that <HI>le&s;s good</HI> may be produ|ced by the operation of the&s;e cau&s;es, than they <HI>na|turally tend</HI> to produce, and actually would pro|duce, if they were not ob&s;tructed in their ope|ration.

<P>The <HI>la&s;t</HI> remark, though not the lea&s;t im|portant, is, that, in judging of the Divine be|nevolence, we mu&s;t carry our thoughts beyond the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> to &s;ome <HI>future</HI> &s;tate of exi&s;tence, and con&s;ider them as <HI>connected</HI> in the Divine <HI>plan</HI> of operation for good.

<P>Another in&s;tance illu&s;trating the <HI>Deity's good|ne&s;s</HI> is, the care he has taken, notwith&s;tanding this <HI>di&s;po&s;ition</HI> of animals into &s;uch <HI>various kinds</HI>&punc; &s;o to provide for them <HI>all,</HI> as that they are <HI>&s;e|verally</HI> capable of attaining the happine&s;s that is <HI>proper</HI> for them.

<P>Nor does it argue any want of goodne&s;s in the <HI>Deity,</HI> that they are not <HI>all equally happy,</HI> or that they none of them enjoy that <HI>degree</HI> of happine&s;s which is common to other beings of a <HI>&s;uperior order.</HI> It is enough to the purpo&s;e of the pre&s;ent argument, if <HI>&s;o much happine&s;s</HI> is allotted to them, as is proper to creatures in their <HI>&s;tate,</HI> and filling up <HI>&s;uch</HI> a <HI>place</HI> in the &s;cale of beings.

<P>Neither are the <HI>inconveniences</HI> they may <HI>natu|rally</HI> be liable to, an <HI>objection</HI> of any weight.

with almo&s;t an infinite variety. So exten&s;ive is the <HI>ground work</HI> laid by tho&s;e powers of <HI>&s;en&s;ati|on</HI> and <HI>reflection,</HI> for acquirements in <HI>knowledge,</HI> and <HI>mental plea&s;ure</HI> the con&s;equence therefrom.</P>
<P>The <HI>other &s;ort</HI> of faculties, or tho&s;e which qualify us for the u&s;e of the&s;e <HI>materials</HI> of know|ledge, are &s;uch as the&s;e.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is, the mind's ability to lay up the ideas it has received, in either of the above ways, as it were, in &s;tore for u&s;e afterwards, with a readine&s;s to revive them, without the pre&s;ence of external objects, or the help of tho&s;e inward reflections, by which they were at fir&s;t occa&s;ion|ed. This is done by the <HI>memory</HI>; which is a nece&s;&s;ary faculty. For, the mind not being ca|pable of attending to many ideas at once, we &s;hould have been but poorly qualified for pro|ficiency in knowledge, had we not been en|dowed with a power to <HI>recall</HI> ideas into view, as we might have occa&s;ion for them, after they had lain out of &s;ight.

It can, on purpo&s;e, employ it&s;elf this way: And the readine&s;s, with which it often revives the perception of pa&s;t ideas, is really a&s;toni&s;hing.&mdash;
<PB N="101" REF="018397_0099_0FA70B9AB3AC1A88">
I need not &s;ay any thing to point out the <HI>u&s;e|fulne&s;s</HI> of this faculty, and the mighty help it is fitted to afford us in <HI>intellectual</HI> acquirements. Were we not thus furni&s;hed, we &s;hould nece&s;|&s;arily be confined to <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> ideas, as they might happen, in a <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> way, to be excited in our minds: Whereas now we have it in our power to employ our thoughts on any of tho&s;e ideas which have, at any time, been imprinted on our minds, as we are <HI>plea&s;ed</HI> to call for them, in the pur&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it of <HI>intellectual</HI> happine&s;s. And what an un&s;peakable advantage is this? It not only makes the way to knowledge much ea&s;ier and quicker than it could otherwi&s;e have been; but greatly enlarges the capacity for it, by laying a proper foundation in our nature for very con|&s;iderable attainments in this kind.</P>
<P>Another power is <HI>di&s;cernment</HI>; by which I un|der&s;tand an ability to <HI>di&s;tingui&s;h</HI> ideas from one another, according to the real difference there is between them. And a very important fa|culty this is. Witho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t it the former faculties would be, in a manner, u&s;ele&s;s. It is not meerly the power of receiving ideas, or the power of recalling them into view after their di&s;appear|ance, that would have been &s;ufficient for attain|ments in knowledge. A faculty to <HI>di&s;criminate</HI> them from one another was further nece&s;&s;ary: Nor otherwi&s;e would our thoughts have been any other than &s;o many conf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ed ideas. What we call <HI>judgment</HI> is chiefly dependant on this faculty. It con&s;i&s;ts in the mind's readine&s;s to
<PB N="102" REF="018397_0100_0FA70B9EC6652178">
di&s;cern the difference there is between ideas: And the more nicely and accurately it is able to di&s;tingui&s;h them, the better and more perfect is the judgment. It is owing to this faculty that ideas lie clear and determinate in the mind; and by the help of it we are not only pre&s;erved from perplexity in our notions, but from mi&s;|takes al&s;o, ari&s;ing from a &s;eeming likene&s;s in ideas when they really differ. It is, in &s;hort, in con&s;equence of this faculty, that we are able to rea&s;on clearly and &s;olidly, &s;etting before our own view, and the view of others, the evidence of truth in a &s;trong and &s;atisfactory p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">int of light. The <HI>u&s;efulne&s;s</HI> of this faculty may be learned from tho&s;e <HI>perceptions of truth,</HI> which have taken ri&s;e from it, to the increa&s;e of know|ledge, in &s;o many in&s;tances, redounding &s;o greatly to the benefit of mankind.</P>
<P>Another power the mind is furni&s;hed with, is that of <HI>compounding, enlarging,</HI> and <HI>dimini&s;hing,</HI> the ideas that have been let into it: By means whereof it is capable, in a &s;en&s;e, of making <HI>new objects</HI> of perception, by pre&s;enting to the view of the under&s;tanding the <HI>original</HI> ideas, received by <HI>&s;en&s;ation</HI> or <HI>reflection,</HI> in <HI>new complex forms</HI> with|out end. In con&s;equence of this <HI>compounding</HI> power, we become, as it were, <HI>Creators</HI>; being able to frame images at our plea&s;ure, hereby <HI>mul|tiplying</HI> the objects of thought, and giving occa|&s;ion for infinitely various <HI>new perceptions,</HI> accom|panied with plea&s;ure, we mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have been &s;trangers to. The <HI>imagination</HI> is chiefly
<PB N="103" REF="018397_0101_0FA70BA1B6CB5800">
employed in this work of making <HI>new complex</HI> ideas. It is able indeed, with quickne&s;s and vi|vacity, to revive former images; but its power lies principally in framing <HI>new forms</HI> or <HI>&s;pecies,</HI> which exi&s;t only in conception. And a wonder|ful faculty it is to this purpo&s;e. How admirably quick is it in its operations? How &s;uddenly can it unite and blend together the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t di&s;tant ideas, varying them from their &s;imple origi|nals, and &s;etting them before the mind with in|finite diver&s;ity?

<P>A &s;till more u&s;eful power is that whereby we are enabled to a&s;&s;emble ideas in <HI>various po&s;itions</HI> and <HI>arrangements,</HI> in order to <HI>compare</HI> them toge|ther, and view them in the <HI>re&s;pects</HI> and <HI>relations</HI> they bear to each other.

other, is what is principally meant by <HI>invention.</HI> But as it is employed in placing <HI>invented truths,</HI> or propo&s;itions already perceived to be truths, in like <HI>po&s;itions,</HI> in order to deduce &s;till other truths, it is called <HI>rea&s;oning</HI>; which is them ble&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;eful operation of the mind, and that indeed for which all its faculties were prin|cipally de&s;igned.</P>
<P>The la&s;t power of the mind which I &s;hall mention, and indeed I have only mentioned the foregoing ones; for it would require a volume to enlarge &s;everally on them, as might ea&s;ily be done: I &s;ay, the la&s;t power the mind is furni&s;hed with is that of <HI>ab&s;traction</HI>; by which it makes <HI>particular</HI> idea <HI>general</HI> ones. And this it does by withdrawing or &s;eparating from them the&s;e and tho&s;e circum&s;tances which accompa|nied them, as excited by <HI>particular</HI> objects, and con&s;idering them in that <HI>general</HI> view only, wherein many other objects do agree with them. As for example:&mdash;The &s;ame idea, &s;ignified by the term <HI>redne&s;s,</HI> being perceived to day upon the &s;ight of a <HI>cherry,</HI> which was perceived ye&s;|terday upon the &s;ight of a <HI>brick,</HI> and the day before upon the &s;ight of <HI>blood,</HI> the mind con|&s;iders this idea <HI>ab&s;tracted</HI> from the&s;e <HI>particular objects,</HI> or at lea&s;t tho&s;e c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itant ideas which accompanied its perception from each of them&punc; making it a <HI>general</HI> idea comprehending all exi&s;tences that agree in being <HI>red.</HI> And to this faculty we are beholden for the benefit of <HI>lan|guage. Particular names</HI> for <HI>particular ideas</HI> would,

in a great mea&s;ure, have de&s;troyed the u&s;e of &s;peech, by rendering it infinitely tedious. <HI>Ab&s;traction</HI> is the remedy again&s;t this. It is the mind's capacity to make <HI>general</HI> ideas that has given ri&s;e to <HI>general</HI> names; by means whereof language is made ea&s;y, and we are qualified with convenient &s;peed, by the intervention of words, &s;poken or written, to convey our thoughts to one another.

would have been no foundation laid for it in nature, if it was not in our own power, by care and pains, to make <HI>intellectual improve|ments.</HI> If knowledge had been the gift of the <HI>Deity,</HI> independently of our&s;elves, we &s;hould have had no rea&s;on, were we endowed with it in ever &s;o high a mea&s;ure, for the lea&s;t <HI>&s;elf-ap|probation</HI> on this account: Nor could we <HI>rati|onally</HI> have enjoyed <HI>that plea&s;ure</HI> which is now a natural con&s;equence therefrom. So that the pre&s;ent method for the communication of <HI>in|tellectual good</HI> is a better fitted one for the pur|po&s;e, than that which is pleaded for in the ob|jection; becau&s;e knowledge <HI>ab&s;olutely communi|cated</HI> is not capable of yielding <HI>&s;o much</HI> happi|ne&s;s, as that which is attained to, by proper faculties, in the u&s;e of labor and pains: For there would be wanting the con&s;cious reflection on our <HI>own merit</HI> in the procurement of it: We could not look upon it as our <HI>own acqui&s;ition,</HI> and con&s;equently could not, unle&s;s upon a fal&s;e bottom, perceive that <HI>&s;elf-approbation,</HI> from whence alone can re&s;ult the <HI>noble&s;t-kind</HI> of plea|&s;ure we are capable of.

<PB N="119" REF="018397_0117_0FA70C282ABCEB00">
conceivable, how there could have been either <HI>room</HI> or <HI>rea&s;on</HI> for tho&s;e noble exertions, which, upon the pre&s;ent plan, are properly called forth; and &s;uitably recompen&s;ed. Be&s;ides, there could be no &s;uch thing as any <HI>moral</HI> attainment, if nothing could be acquired by the due exer|ci&s;e of our natural faculties. The capacity of making acqui&s;itions, by our own endeavours, &s;uitably employed, is the true and only ba&s;is of all our <HI>moral</HI> perfection.

<P>So that, upon the whole, in&s;tead of com|plaining of God for not furni&s;hing us with powers, wonderfully contrived to fit us for in|tellectual attainments, and the happine&s;s con|&s;equent thereupon, we have rea&s;on rather to admire the greatne&s;s of his benevolence. It does not indeed appear, wherein he could have di&s;played his goodne&s;s, as guided by wi&s;dom, more con&s;picuou&s;ly than he has d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne, to an order of beings in &s;uch a world as our's, and

as &s;u&s;taining &s;uch a place in the &s;cale of intelli|gent exi&s;tences.</P>
<P>I now go on to illu&s;trate the benevolence of the Deity, by taking as conci&s;e a view as I well can of tho&s;e powers, he has endowed us with, fitting us for <HI>moral</HI> happine&s;s&punc; the highe&s;t any being can be made capable of. And tho&s;e, the other mental powers, already mentioned, not being unattended to, are, in general, the fol|lowing ones.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t power in our nature [call it common &s;en&s;e, moral &s;en&s;e, moral di&s;cernment&punc; or give it any other name that may be thought better] is that by which we are enabled at once, with|out the labor of a long train of rea&s;oning, to di&s;|tingui&s;h between moral good, and moral evil, in all in&s;tances that are of primary importance, and e&s;&s;entially connected with the good of the moral world.</P>
<P>There is an unalterable difference between virtue and vice, or, what means the &s;ame thing, between moral good, and moral evil. They have their re&s;pective natures, and are unchange|able oppo&s;ites. Vice cannot be made virtue, nor on the contrary, can virtue be made vice. They are in them&s;elves what they are, and will remain &s;o without variation, or the &s;hadow of turning. It is, on the one hand, fit and right, that we &s;hould be pious towards God, righteous towards our fellow-men, and &s;ober with re&s;pect to our&s;elves; and, on the other, unfit and wrong, that we &s;hould be impious towards the Deity, unju&s;t
<PB N="121" REF="018397_0119_0FA70C294795A298">
in our treatment of men, and intemperate in the gratification of our animal appetites: Nor is it po&s;&s;ible this moral order &s;hould be inverted. No will, no power, either of men, or angels, or even the Supreme Ruler him&s;elf, can make it right to be impious, in&s;tead of pious towards God; or unrighteous, in&s;tead of righteous to|wards men; or intemperate, in&s;tead of &s;ober, in regard of our&s;elves. To &s;uppo&s;e this, would be to era&s;e the foundations of the moral &s;y&s;tem, to de&s;troy the relation that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the Creator and his creatures, and between the creatures with re&s;pect to one another, and to make virtue and vice nothing more than arbi|trary names, having in them&s;elves no certainly fixed nature.</P>
<P>And as virtue and vice, moral good and mo|ral evil, are thus different from each other, &s;o is this difference obviou&s;ly and at once, per|ceivable by all morally intelligent minds, unle&s;s they have been greatly corrupted. There may indeed be in&s;tances of moral conduct, in mat|ters of comparatively &s;mall importance, with re&s;pect to which it may be difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h between the right and wrong. And the analo|gy here, it may be worthy of notice, is very exact between the <HI>natural,</HI> and the <HI>moral</HI> world. Light and darkne&s;s may be &s;o mixed, that one can &s;carce know which to call it. Sweet and bitter may be &s;o blended together, that it may be difficult to &s;ay which is prevalent. Colors may be &s;o dilated, and placed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> portrait,

that the eye of a &s;kilful painter may not be able to di&s;cern the preci&s;e point where one begins, and another ends. But, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e mixtures, light is never the &s;ame thing with darkne&s;s, nor bitter with &s;weet, nor one color that of another; and they are, unle&s;s in &s;uch com|plicated ca&s;es, readily and at once di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other. In like manner, there may be, and often are, in the moral world, ca&s;es wherein the boundaries between good and evil, and the &s;pot that divides them, may not be ea&s;i|ly, if at all, di&s;cerned, &s;o as to be able to &s;ay, with preci&s;ion, here virtue runs into vice, and vice into virtue&punc; But this hinders not but that, in the main and e&s;&s;ential branches of morality, the virtuous, and the vicious conduct may obvi|ou&s;ly be perceived, where the mind's perceptive power has not been, in a great degree, vitiated, and hurt. And, in very truth, the God of nature has, in his abundant goodne&s;s, &s;o formed our minds, and given us &s;uch a power of di&s;cern|ment, that it mu&s;t be owing, unle&s;s we are ideots, or madmen, to &s;ome heinous faultine&s;s, we our|&s;elves are ju&s;tly chargable with, if we are not able, without difficulty, to di&s;cern the difference right and wrong, in the more important points of moral obligation. Will any man, who has not &s;trangely perverted the proper u&s;e of his perceptive powers pretend, that he cannot, or that he does not, &s;ee it to be fit and right, on the one hand, that &s;uch a creature as he is &s;o related to God&punc; and dependant on him,

&s;hould yield to him the love of his heart, and the obedience of his life; and, on the other, that it would be unfit and wrong to withdraw his affection from him, and behave with di&s;re|&s;pect towards him?

There needs no argumentation, no &s;eries of intermediate ideas, to point it out. Barely mentioning them, provided it is done in

words that are clearly under&s;tood, will at once, enforce conviction, unle&s;s in &s;eeing men will not &s;ee; in which ca&s;e it would be a vain thing to expect, that rea&s;oning &s;hould have an effectual influence on them. For illu&s;tration, I &s;hall bring to view here a particular in&s;tance. That rule of conduct, "do to others as you would they &s;hould do to you," is &s;o evidently fit and right, that, upon the bare propo&s;al of it, the mind at once di&s;cerns it to be ju&s;t and equal. To u&s;e arguments to make it appear rea&s;onable, would be only to darken the evidence of its be|ing &s;o. No medium of proof could, in this ca&s;e, be introduced, which would not more need to be proved, than the thing it&s;elf it is brought to prove. It is not indeed ea&s;ily con|ceivable, that any man, who has the under|&s;tanding of a man, and is not under undue in|fluence from evil affection, &s;hould he&s;itate one moment in his judgment as to the &s;uitablene&s;s of this moral rule of conduct, its equity is &s;o obvious, and &s;o in&s;tantly and glaringly &s;trikes the di&s;cerning power, we are all naturally fur|ni&s;hed with. And, in truth, however com|mon it may be, among men, to throw practi|cal contempt upon this rule in their treatment of one another, none do it becau&s;e they enter|tain in their minds an opinion of it as an unfair, unequal regulator of their behavior; but be|cau&s;e they are thoughtle&s;s and inattentive, or &s;uffer them&s;elves to be enticed, and led a&s;ide by ungoverned pride, pa&s;&s;ion and lu&s;t of one kind or
<PB N="125" REF="018397_0123_0FA70C2CF6DF4978">
another. This is the true rea&s;on, why they act in contradiction to the rule of right, not only in this, but in all other great and important ca&s;es in moral life. They indulge the&s;e and tho&s;e vicious gratifications, not becau&s;e they do not perceive them to be unrea&s;onable, but becau&s;e they are excited hereto by the lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h, or mind, or both. It is true, the moral power of di&s;cernment, as well as the other intellectual faculties, may, in common with the bodily or|gans, be &s;o debilitated, if not &s;poiled, by men's accu&s;toming them&s;elves to do evil, as to be unfitted for the proper u&s;e for which they were implanted in their nature. And, perhaps, there are &s;ome, among wicked men, who, by having long habituated them&s;elves to live and act, as hurried on by the impetus of ungoverned pa&s;&s;ions and affections, &s;uch as an irregular love of them&s;elves, and their own &s;eparate intere&s;t; the love of honor; the love of riches; the love of &s;en&s;uality, and other lu&s;ts: I &s;ay, there are tho&s;e, who, by a cour&s;e of thus conducting, have gradually &s;o weakened their moral &s;ight, as to be, in a great mea&s;ure, if not totally, unable to di&s;cern tho&s;e actions to be wrong, which are glaringly &s;o, and appear to be &s;o, with a meridian lu&s;tre, to all who have eyes to &s;ee. But this is not the common and ordinary &s;tate even of wicked men. There are, it may be, comparatively few, but have &s;o much mo|ral di&s;cernment, as not to be able to go on in vicious practice, in in&s;tances that are great and
<PB N="126" REF="018397_0124_0FA70C2E077AA470">
heinous, without remon&s;trances from within. They do not &s;infully gratify their appetites, be|cau&s;e they have no &s;ight, or &s;en&s;e, of its being unfit, and wrong that they &s;hould do &s;o; but becau&s;e they are tempted of their lu&s;t and over|come. The law in their members, getting the better of the law in their minds, influences them to do that they approve not; yea, many times, that they even hate, it is &s;o oppo&s;ite to the light in them, which ought to be the guide of their conduct.</P>
<P>The account I have thus given of that im|planted power in our nature, which enables us at once, without labor and pains, to di&s;cern the difference between right and wrong in all great and important in&s;tances in moral life, is, I imagine, &s;trictly ju&s;t, and verified to be &s;o by the univer&s;al experience of mankind. The plain truth is, we are &s;o formed by the God of nature as that we as readily, and with as much certainty, perceive <HI>moral</HI> qualities as tho&s;e that are po&s;&s;ible. By the intervention of our bodily organs, we directly perceive the difference be|tween white and black, &s;weet and bitter, and know that the one is not, and cannot be, the other. By the di&s;cerning power of our minds we perceive, in the like direct and immediate way, the&s;e and tho&s;e qualities of temper and conduct, and are at once &s;atisfied that they are either morally good, not evil; or morally evil, not good: Nor is this moral di&s;cernment con|fined to &s;ome among men, in di&s;tinction from
<PB N="127" REF="018397_0125_0FA70C2EE2046B78">
others; but is common to all; as being a power the whole human race come into the world en|dowed with. And it is from this power that moral rea&s;oning takes ri&s;e. It &s;uppo&s;es &s;uch a perception of moral qualities as is common to all, and in which all, not having corrupted their minds, acquie&s;ce as primary principles; and in the&s;e, rea&s;oning, with reference to the moral world, mu&s;t finally terminate in order to its be|ing &s;trictly conclu&s;ive; and wherein it fails of doing &s;o, by a non-connection in the chain of intermediate ideas brought to view, it is e&s;&s;enti|ally defective; or &s;hould the connection be ju&s;t, but not di&s;cerned by any to be &s;o, it mu&s;t, as to them, be the &s;ame as if it was really in&s;uffi|cient arguing. Primary moral truths, &s;uch as are perceived, and a&s;&s;ented to, as &s;uch; and this, without he&s;itation, by mankind in common&punc; in con&s;equence of that power of di&s;cernment they come into being furni&s;hed with, are the only ba&s;is on which there can be rea&s;oning to any purpo&s;e among men, with relation to the moral &s;y&s;tem. Rea&s;oning powers, if there were no fir&s;t moral principles, in which mankind could agree without debate would &s;erve rather to promote endle&s;s wranglings, than virtuous pur|&s;uits, in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e that are vicious. The author of our beings has therefore wi&s;ely, as well as kindly, taken care to plant in our nature a morally di&s;cerning power, which is admirably fitted to di&s;tingui&s;h without difficulty, between right and wrong, that we might chu&s;e and pur&s;ue
<PB N="128" REF="018397_0126_0FA70C2F39068E78">
the former, and refu&s;e and avoid the latter. In virtue of this power, and by the exerci&s;e of it, if we have not weakened, nor &s;poilt it, we may, as it were, by a glance of our moral &s;ight, in all important ca&s;es, &s;o perceive the difference there is in actions as to pronounce with certainty, that the&s;e are morally good, tho&s;e morally evil. What a noble implantation is this power in our nature? What a mighty guard again&s;t vice, and preparative for virtuous practice? Wherein could better provi&s;ion have been for &s;uch im|perfect beings as we are to engage our care to act up to that which is right, and not allow our|&s;elves in doing what is wrong? We are cer|tainly laid under the &s;tronge&s;t obligations of love and gratitude to that Glorious Being, who has implanted in us this excellent power, and &s;hall be inexcu&s;ably blind if we do not &s;ee that he is benevolent, and ba&s;e to an high degree if we do not find our&s;elves di&s;po&s;ed to make our humble and thankful acknowledgements to him as &s;uch.</P>
<P>Another power in our nature is that of <HI>&s;elf-de|termination,</HI> which gives ri&s;e to our volitions, and con&s;equent actions, and is, in true propriety, the cau&s;e of them. This power in us men, whether it be called &s;elf-determination, or by any other name, is the only ba&s;is of moral ob|ligation. Unle&s;s this be fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed, to talk of moral agency is a contradiction to common &s;en&s;e, and in it&s;elf a gro&s;s ab&s;urdity. We might, it is true, without the implantation of &s;uch a power in our nature, in con&s;equence of a chain

of exterior cau&s;es, not within the reach of our controul, be made in&s;truments in the producti|on of any effects which are unavoidably con|nected with their chain of fatality, &s;hould even volition or choice be one of its links. But agents, free agents, we could not be, of whom it might, in con&s;i&s;tency with truth, be affirm|ed that they were the producers of the&s;e ef|fects: The author of this chain of cau&s;es, which inevitably gives exi&s;tence to them, is their real, and only proper cau&s;e. A power in man that will &s;ubject his volitions to his com|mand, and con&s;titute him the efficient of tho&s;e effects that are con&s;equent upon them, is the only bottom upon which agency can, with the lea&s;t &s;hadow of propriety, be grounded. There is, in the nature of things, an e&s;&s;ential difference between con&s;cious voluntary machines, and agents; that is, in other words of preci&s;ely the &s;ame import, beings that are, &s;trictly &s;pea|king, cau&s;es of the effects that are a&s;cribed to them. Such agents are we men; and we are, or maybe, as certain of it as that we po&s;&s;e&s;s ex|i&s;tence. For it is as evident a truth, and as evi|dently perceived by the mind to be &s;o. We do not ordinarily make our&s;elves &s;o ridiculous as to endeavour, by rea&s;oning, to prove to our|&s;elves that we exi&s;t. We know that we do without argumentation, becau&s;e we feel that we do. It is an object of direct, immediate, and unavoidable perception, &s;uper&s;eding the u&s;e of arguments, and indeed rendering it needle&s;s,
<PB N="130" REF="018397_0128_0FA70C30C0BB1688">
not to &s;ay ab&s;urd. The &s;ame may be &s;aid, and with equal propriety, of that power, we are natu|rally endowed with, which con&s;titutes us agents, or beings that are <HI>efficiently</HI> the cau&s;es of their own volitions and actions. To go about to prove this, by a long train of rea&s;oning, would be very like holding a candle to the &s;un, in its meridian lu&s;tre, for light that we might be able to &s;ee. It is a fir&s;t, and fundamental principle in morals, and to be evidenced, not by arguing, but by an appeal to common &s;en&s;e, or, in other words, the perceptions of mankind univer&s;ally. We all feel the exi&s;tence, and operation of this power every day we live. The language of all the world, their projections, their pur&s;uits, and the whole frame and order of their affairs, relative both to this, and the &s;tate that is beyond it, are founded on this &s;up|po&s;ition, and would be &s;o many downright in|con&s;i&s;tencies, if they were not, from their own perceptions, &s;o certainly convinced, that this &s;uppo&s;ition was the real truth, as to admit it into their minds as &s;uch without the lea&s;t he|&s;itation.</P>
<P>Many there were, I know, among the pagan philo&s;ophers, in former ages, who thought, and &s;ome there are among the philo&s;ophers, not to &s;ay divines, of the pre&s;ent age, who agree with them in thinking, that all effects take ri&s;e from a chain of cau&s;es, with the Deity at its head as the only efficient, &s;o unavoidably linked together, connected with, and dependant on each other,
<PB N="131" REF="018397_0129_0FA70C35E286E1E8">
that the coming of the&s;e effects into event, in con&s;equence of the unavoidable operation of the&s;e cau&s;es, is not only certain, but ab&s;olutely inevitable. And they con&s;ider mankind, with all their powers, as &s;o many links in this ad|amantine chain, no one of which can po&s;&s;ibly fail in the production of the effect a&s;&s;igned to it.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, among the abettors of this &s;cheme, who are capable of looking forward to con&s;e|quences not very far di&s;tant, clearly and fully perceive its incon&s;i&s;tency with men's being free agents, and that it totally de&s;troys the idea of moral good and evil. They accordingly de|clare with an hone&s;t, frank openne&s;s, that the di&s;tinction that is commonly made between mo|ral good and evil has no foundation in nature, however well adapted it may be to vulgar pre|judices and conceptions.

day and night, without intermi&s;&s;ion, for|ever and ever. This is the &s;cheme embraced by &s;ome at this day, and by &s;ome too who are called divines, and would be looked upon as the only orthodox ones among their brethren. But it is &s;o gro&s;sly fal&s;e an one, &s;o deba&s;ing to the nature of man, and &s;o di&s;honorary to the perfectly benevolent God, that it is &s;trange any &s;hould entertain a favorable opinion of it.</P>
<P>The chief thing they &s;ay in its &s;upport is, that it leaves mankind at liberty to do as they &s;hall plea&s;e, to conduct without re&s;traint con|formably to what they have willed, and cho&s;en. And what greater liberty can be de&s;ired? If we may not be thought capable of acting mo|rally well or ill, while we are able, without hindrance from exterior cau&s;es, to do as we chu&s;e to do, what can make us moral agents? What more is nece&s;&s;ary? What more are we con&s;cious of, from any perception of our minds? The an&s;wer is at once obvious. It is not true, that our perceptions go no further than to a&s;|&s;ure us, that we can do as we have willed, and are plea&s;ed to do. Be&s;ides this, and far beyond it, they certify it to us, that we are at liberty to will or not to will, to chu&s;e or not to chu&s;e, the doing of the&s;e and tho&s;e actions. We feel in our&s;elves a power over our volitions, and &s;uch an one as enables us to direct, &s;u&s;pend, over|rule, or put an intire &s;top to them: Nor, un|le&s;s we were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this dominion, could we be agents, however great liberty might be
<PB N="133" REF="018397_0131_0FA70C36CEFB3098">
allowed us in bringing into event what we have previou&s;ly willed. It is e&s;&s;ential to free agency, and &s;uch a u&s;e of it as to make us capable of good or ill de&s;erts, that our volitions upon which our actions follow, &s;hould be within the reach of our command. The birds of the air, and the bea&s;ts of the field, will and chu&s;e what they do as really as we men; and it may, with as much truth, be &s;aid of them, as of us, that they do as they are plea&s;ed to do. Their whole cour&s;e of conduct is the effect of previous choice and plea&s;ure. But we never call them agents, nor do we e&s;teem them &s;uch. And why? The rea|&s;on is, becau&s;e they have no power over their volition. They are effects produced in them by the operation of cau&s;es, not within their governing command. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of mad-men. Their actions are voluntary. They do nothing, but in con&s;equence of previous will and plea&s;ure; but we do not account them ca|pable either of moral good or evil. Should they do ever &s;o much mi&s;chief, we do not charge them with ill de&s;ert, however loud we may be in complaints that they are not re&s;trained from doing hurt, by being kept under due confine|ment. And what is the rea&s;on of our think|ing thus differently of di&s;tracted men, and others who have the full u&s;e of their mental powers? The true and only rea&s;on is, the for|mer are hurried on to volition by a wild im|petus, over which which they have no power; but the latter have it in their power, to re&s;train

and govern their wills and choices: Nor, un|le&s;s they were endowed with this power, would it con&s;i&s;t with common &s;en&s;e to think, or &s;peak, of them as moral agents.

<P>It is readily allowed, liberty in man, in op|po&s;ition to nece&s;&s;ity, is one of the great wonders of God. The power in our nature that con&s;ti|tutes us free agents is an amazing contrivance of infinite wi&s;dom. The modus of its exi&s;t|ence and operation is too great a deep for us to fathom. It has tried, and puzzled the greate&s;t geniu&s;&s;es in all ages, and in all parts of the world. And, perhaps, we &s;hall never be able, at lea&s;t on this &s;ide mortality, to take in a comprehen&s;ive idea of it. But is this a good rea&s;on why we &s;hould deny, or di&s;pute, the real being of &s;uch a power in our con&s;tituti|on? Do any know, or can they, by metaphy&s;ical &s;earching, find out the nexus between &s;oul and body? Can they tell us how they influence each other? And yet, it is certain there is this nexus,
<PB N="136" REF="018397_0134_0FA70C3A82FA2560">
and mutual influence between them: Nor can it be di&s;proved by all the &s;ubtilty of vain rea&s;oning. The &s;ame may be &s;aid with re&s;pect to the pow|er of man over his volitions, and con&s;equent actions. The manner of its exi&s;tence goes be|yond our inve&s;tigation; but the real exi&s;t|ence of &s;uch a power can never be di&s;proved, however it may be darkened and perplexed. We feel it to be a truth, in con&s;equence of which we are, in a rea&s;onable &s;en&s;e, ma&s;ters of our|&s;elves. Our daily experience, if attended to, will indubitably a&s;&s;ure us, that the exertions of our minds and bodies are under our own dominion.</P>
<P>The plain truth is, &s;uch a power in men as will make them cau&s;es, real proper cau&s;es, of their volitions, and the effects con&s;equent upon them, is the grand &s;upporting pillar of the world, con&s;idered as moral. Take this away, and it at once falls into de&s;olation and utter ruin. If men's volitions, and their con&s;equent effects, are the re&s;ult of invariable nece&s;&s;ity, in virtue of exterior cau&s;es &s;o inviolably connected, as that they will, and mu&s;t, come to pa&s;s, the author of this connection, which, according to this plan, is God, is the only agent in our world, and the only efficient, and real author, of what|ever has been, or &s;hall hereafter be brought into event; not excluding any of the mo&s;t complicated villanies that have been, or may be perpetrated by any of the &s;ons of Adam. Is this a &s;cheme of thoughts fit to be embrac|ed by intelligent creatures? Will it not di|rectly,
<PB N="137" REF="018397_0135_0FA70C3B37FFAD98">
and certainly follow, from the &s;uppo&s;i|tion of its truth, that virtue and vice are idle names, having no reality in nature? That men's accountablene&s;s to God, and liablene&s;s to be puni&s;hed, upon the foot of ill-de&s;ert, are vulgar notions only, incapable of any &s;olid &s;upport? That the character of God, as a moral Gover|nor, is a vain imagination? And, in a word, that religion, whether natural or revealed, is a &s;en&s;ele&s;s pretence, &s;uited only to &s;erve the pur|po&s;es of politicians and prie&s;ts? It would indeed, upon this &s;cheme, be ridiculou&s;ly ab&s;urd to &s;up|po&s;e there ever was, or could be any &s;uch thing.</P>
<P>Having thus evinced, from our con&s;cious perceptions, that we are the &s;ubjects of an in|ward, governing power over our faculties, in virtue of which we are con&s;tituted free agents, as being the true and proper cau&s;es of our vo|lition, and con&s;equent actions, it will be ea&s;y to point out the benevolence of the Deity in putting this power in our nature. It is indeed the mo&s;t important one we are endowed with, and the only ba&s;is of the highe&s;t happine&s;s, in kind, we are made capable of enjoying. Had not this power been planted in us, we &s;hould have been pa&s;&s;ive in&s;truments, not moral agents. It is this power that di&s;tingui&s;hes us from all the various cla&s;&s;es of inferior animals, and ren|ders it po&s;&s;ible for us to perceive plea&s;ure far &s;uperior in its nature to any, they can be the &s;ub|jects of.

nor of the plea&s;ure that is the natural re&s;ult therefrom. This, perhaps, is the highe&s;t kind of plea&s;ure communicable from the Deity; and it is perceivable only by moral agents. No beings, to whom the Deity has not committed the care of governing their faculties, can, by the exerci&s;e of them, de&s;erve the applau&s;e of their own hearts, and enjoy the &s;ublime &s;atisfaction ari&s;ing herefrom: But it is within the reach of the capacity of all &s;uch to feel this &s;elf-appro|bation, and con&s;equent plea&s;ure; and they may go on in this enjoyment with continually in|crea&s;ing degrees, in proportion to the degrees of virtue they di&s;cover in the good government of the&s;e various faculties, they are entru&s;ted with the care of. What a nobly intere&s;ting power is this, that makes us free agents, as, by doing &s;o, it makes us the capable percipients of hap|pine&s;s more highly exalted, in kind, than it could otherwi&s;e have been? It is not conceiva|ble, wherein the perfectly benevolent Being could have made a better, and, at the &s;ame time a wi&s;er provi&s;ion for our enjoyment of the high|e&s;t kind of happine&s;s: E&s;pecially, if it be re|membered, that he has con&s;tituted &s;uch a con|nection between this happine&s;s he has made us capable of, and the actual enjoyment of it, as that it cannot be enjoyed but in con&s;equence of a right exerci&s;e of that power, which character|i&s;es us moral agents; by which means, our coming to the enjoyment of this happine&s;s, we may be the &s;ubjects of, is a con&s;tant, continually

abiding, and powerful motive to engage our care thus to exerci&s;e this power in our nature. What an admirable contrivance for our good is this? How amazingly does it illu&s;trate both the wi&s;dom, and benevolence of God! It may fur|ther enlarge our idea of this benevolence, if it be con&s;idered, that our Creator has, in like man|ner, con&s;tituted a connection between carele&s;sne&s;s in the exertion of this power, or, in exerting it an undue wrong manner, with &s;elf-di&s;approbation, and con&s;equent unea&s;ine&s;s. This, it is po&s;&s;ible, may appear to &s;ome, at the fir&s;t glance, an ob|jection again&s;t the Divine benevolence, rather than a proof of it. But a little attention will &s;hew the contrary. What was the de&s;ign of our maker in thus connecting di&s;approbation and unea&s;ine&s;s with a carele&s;s, inattentive, and wrong exertion of the power that con&s;titutes us agents? Was it that he might make us unhappy? No; but quite the rever&s;e. It is an expedient he purpo&s;ely contrived, a connection he wi&s;ely and kindly con&s;tituted, that he might prevent our making our&s;elves mi&s;erable. His view was, that we might perpetually carry in our own brea&s;ts a powerful motive to make our&s;elves happy. And one of the mo&s;t con&s;training motives it is to put us upon &s;o u&s;ing our determining power, as that we may hold exi&s;tence with &s;elf-approba|tion and that heart-felt plea&s;ure which re&s;ults therefrom. I may properly add yet further here, this command we are entru&s;ted with over the exertion of our faculties, and a right u&s;e of it,

Some, perhaps, may be di&s;po&s;ed to treat the notion of happine&s;s, as taking ri&s;e from the approbation of God, and the perception of it in the brea&s;t, with &s;neering contempt. But they ought, with|out fear of giving them any ju&s;t occa&s;ion of of|fence, to be freely told, they are &s;o formed by the author of nature, that they could not be chargable with this guilt, if they had not fir&s;t corrupted, and in a great mea&s;ure &s;poilt, their perceptive powers, by having walked according to the cour&s;e of this world, fulfilling the de&s;ires of the fle&s;h and mind. It is, beyond all doubt, owing to this, if any can find within them&s;elves a di&s;po&s;edne&s;s to prophane this highly important and intere&s;ting matter with banter and ridicule.

If there is &s;uch an exi&s;ting being as God (as there mo&s;t certainly is) his approbation mu&s;t be worth more than all earthly good; and a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that we are the objects of it mu&s;t yield inward delight, greater than can be con|ceived of by tho&s;e who&s;e affections are &s;et upon the infinitely lower plea&s;ures of time and &s;en&s;e. Free agency, in oppo&s;ition to nece&s;&s;ity, is that only which can, in con&s;i&s;tency with rea&s;on, pre|pare the way for what we mean by the ap|probation of God. And it is an argument of his benevolence, and the greatne&s;s of it, that he has &s;o made us, as that, by a right u&s;e of our powers, we may attain to a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being the objects of this approbation, and a perception of plea&s;ure in connection herewith, or con&s;equent hereupon, which exceeds all other plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ations, while yet it is only a fore-ta&s;te of far more noble and exalted plea&s;ures at God's right hand forever.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides what has hitherto been &s;aid, it may be further worthy of notice, our being free agents is that which not only makes us living images of the Deity in that perfection of his nature which is his greate&s;t glory, but capable percipients, in a degree, of that happine&s;s which is his highe&s;t. Did the exertions of the Divine Being take ri&s;e from the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity as his immen&s;ity, or eternity, he would not be a free agent. In order to this, he mu&s;t be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a power over his volitions, as well as a power of exer|tion in con&s;equence of which he has willed and

cho&s;en. Had he not this power, it would be ab&s;urd to attribute to him that liberty, which is in&s;eparable from free agency: Nor would any di&s;plays of his perfections be morally va|luable in the lea&s;t degree, as they would, in this ca&s;e, be the effects of natural nece&s;&s;ity, not of free choice. It is their being exertions, follow|ing upon what was freely willed that gives them the denomination of moral, and claims our love and gratitude. This power in the Deity, which enables him with freedom, in oppo&s;ition to nece&s;&s;ity, both to will, and to do, is his greate&s;t glory. And it is, perhaps, from the exerci&s;e of this power, that his ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, in the enjoyment of him&s;elf, principally flows. Now, by the implantation of a like power to this in our nature, we are made after the &s;imi|litude of God; and, by a right u&s;e of this power, we are capable of being, in a noble degree, happy a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he is, and with the like kind of happine&s;s. Without controver&s;y, the mo&s;t exalted happine&s;s, it is po&s;&s;ible we &s;hould en|joy, is that which is connected with, and depen|dant on, a free, but wi&s;e and good, u&s;e of that power, in the exerci&s;e of which we may mani|fe&s;t it both to our&s;elves, and others, that we are benevolent, holy, ju&s;t, faithful, and, in a word, perfect, according to our mea&s;ure, as God is perfect. Had we not this power, we could be happy in no other &s;en&s;e, than that in which all meerly percipient beings are &s;o. Our happi|ne&s;s could not be the re&s;ult of our own choice, in
<PB N="143" REF="018397_0141_0FA70C4469480DE0">
the free exerci&s;e of our powers; but the effect of exterior cau&s;es, over which we had no com|mand. We might, it is true, in this way be in a degree happy; but our happine&s;s would not be worthy the name, in compari&s;on with that which ari&s;es from a morally good conduct, in con&s;equence of a right u&s;e of that power which makes us free agents. It may be &s;ubjoined here, the Supreme Being would not have been &s;o happy as he might have been, had not this free|dom of will and choice been one of the glorious perfections of his nature; and the exerci&s;e of this perfection is invariably accompanied with de|light. He is ever plea&s;ed with his elections, and they are a &s;ource of eternal &s;atisfaction to him. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of us men, all due allowance being made for the infinite &s;upe|riority of God to &s;uch creatures as we are. We could not have been &s;o happy without freedom of choice, as we may now be in con&s;equence of our being endowed with it. It is with plea|&s;ure we view our&s;elves as dignified with the power of free election, and the exerci&s;e of this power is always attended with &s;atisfaction; but with &s;atisfaction of the highe&s;t kind, and in the highe&s;t degree within the reach of our capa|cities, when exerci&s;ed in a due manner, and in con&s;i&s;tency with what is right and fit. If we cannot di&s;cern the benevolence of God, and the greatne&s;s of it, in implanting this power in our nature, it &s;hould &s;eem as though it mu&s;t be be|cau&s;e we have &s;o blinded our eyes that we can|not,

<P>Another power &s;till, relative to moral agen|cy, and an highly beneficial one, is <HI>con&s;cience.</HI> No one will deny, that this is one of the pow|ers implanted in our nature. It is an object of immediate perception. We all feel, or have felt, its operation in us.</P>
<P>It would carry me too far out of the way of my pre&s;ent de&s;ign, &s;hould I enlarge in a&s;cer|taining with preci&s;ion the more &s;pecial office of this power, in di&s;tinction from the other powers we are endowed with. It may, however be need|ful ju&s;t to &s;ay, that its office is that of a witne&s;s, not of a law-giver. The work appropriated to it is, not to point out to us the virtues we ought to practice, or the vices we ought to avoid, which would be to invade the province of &s;ome other of our powers; but to be in our brea&s;ts a te&s;tifier for, or again&s;t us, as we have done that which we knew to be right, or wrong. The apo&s;tle Paul has given us a very exact account of the work of con&s;cience, in his epi&s;tle to the Romans. Speaking there of tho&s;e Gentiles, in his day, who, not having the revealed law, yet practi&s;ed, from the principles planted in their nature, the duties which this law pre&s;cribed, he &s;ays, they herefrom made it evident, that they were not wholly de&s;titute of a rule or &s;tandard for their moral conduct, for that the law of God appeared from hence to be, as it were,
<PB N="145" REF="018397_0143_0FA70C45E21EAE20">
engraven on their hearts: Upon which he adds, "their con&s;cience al&s;o bearing witne&s;s, and their thoughts the mean while accu&s;ing or el&s;e excu&s;ing one another." This great apo&s;tle ac|curately di&s;tingui&s;hes here between "the law written on the heart," and "con&s;cience;" not making it the work of con&s;cience to tell men what the precepts of this law were, but to te&s;|tify in their favor, or disfavor, as they had been either obedient or di&s;obedient to them; in con&s;equence of which their thoughts either ac|quit or condemn them. This witne&s;s-bearing power of con&s;cience may, it is true, be ob|&s;tructed in its influence, and diverted in &s;uch a variety of ways, that the de&s;ign and tendency of its implantation in us may not be &s;o fully an&s;wered, as might be wi&s;hed. Virtuous men may, through &s;uper&s;titious fears, wrong notions in religion, unrea&s;onable jealou&s;ies and &s;u&s;picions, lo&s;e in a great mea&s;ure, the advantage that would other|wi&s;e ari&s;e from the te&s;timony of con&s;cience in their favor. And vicious men by blinding their eyes, and hardening their hearts, may &s;o hinder the operation of its witne&s;s, as that the check it would give to their mad cour&s;e of conduct is, in a manner, taken away. But it is capable, even with re&s;pect to &s;uch men as the&s;e, of being &s;o rou&s;ed as that its voice &s;hall be hearkened to. In &s;pite of all their efforts to the contrary, it will a&s;&s;ure them, and upon te&s;timony carrying with it &s;tronger evidence than a thou&s;and out|ward witne&s;&s;es, if God has not been in their

In the&s;e, and &s;uch like ca&s;es, it will &s;ay to them, as Nathan did to David, "Thou art the man." How advantageous a power then is con&s;cience? How kindly, as well as wi&s;ely, is it adapted to pro|mote, on the one hand, the right exerci&s;e of our moral liberty, and, on the other, to re&s;train us from all vicious practice? Our Creator there|fore has manife&s;ted benevolence in giving this power a place in our con&s;titution. And his be|nevolence will &s;hine out with yet more con|&s;picuous lu&s;tre, if we go on, and con&s;ider the affections, or pa&s;&s;ions, he has annexed to con|&s;cience, as auxiliaries in order to an&s;wer the end of the implantation of this power in us. They are &s;uch as the&s;e.</P>
<P>Joy, upon its giving te&s;timony to a man's ha|ving acted his part well.

For the plea|&s;urable &s;en&s;ation to which we give the name of joy is naturally connected with its witne&s;s to a man's having done what was right. The apo&s;|tle Paul has expre&s;&s;ed this in very &s;ignificant words. Says he, "This is our rejoicing, the
<PB N="147" REF="018397_0145_0FA70C491D1553E8">
te&s;timony of our con&s;cience, that in &s;implicity, and godly &s;incerity, not by fle&s;hly wi&s;dom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conver|&s;ation in the world." And what he has thus &s;aid perfectly accords with the truth of known expe|rience. A conver&s;ation ordered, not by the wi&s;dom of this world, but by the rule of &s;trict virtue, will put it in the power of con&s;cience to tell the man, who&s;e character this is, that he has done well; up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n which, agreeably to a Divine e&s;tabli&s;hment, that affection, unle&s;s ob&s;tructed in its motion, will be excited, which will yield joy much greater, both in kind and degree, than their's, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e only plea&s;ure is that which takes ri&s;e from their bodily &s;en&s;es.

<P>And as the witne&s;s of c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;cience, when in fa|vor of a man, is connected with joy; &s;o is its te&s;timony, when again&s;t him, accompanied with &s;hame. This is a pa&s;&s;ion we can much better under&s;tand the meaning of by internal feelings than by outward de&s;cription. And we are none of us ignorant of what is intended by it, as we have often had occa&s;ion, from our own perceptions, to know what it is. Its pro|per object is that which is, in its nature, re|proachful. And as nothing is more reproach|ful than moral deformity, nothing is more pow|erfully fitted to excite the exerci&s;e of this pa&s;&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n.

&s;hame, upon having made our&s;elves morally deformed, e&s;pecially when con&s;cience &s;hall &s;peak to us, and tell us that this is our ju&s;t character. There have all along been, it mu&s;t be owned, and there now are tho&s;e, who, by debauching their minds, and weakening, if not de&s;troying, their natural &s;en&s;ibility, have, in a manner, eradicated the innate principle of &s;hame, being able, without a blu&s;h, notwith&s;tanding the power of con&s;cience, to do tho&s;e things which are gro&s;sly ignominious and reproachful. This is emphatically expre&s;&s;ed, by Jeremiah, in the&s;e words, "Thou ha&s;t a whore's forehead, thou refu&s;ed&s;t to be a&s;hamed." And again, "Were they a&s;hamed, when they had committed abo|mination? Nay, they were not at all a&s;hamed, neither could they blu&s;h." But this is not the ordinary &s;tate of vicious men. Few, compara|tively, are &s;o blinded, and hardened, as not to be filled with confu&s;ion of face, when con&s;cience tells them in direct and po&s;itive terms, that they have been, and know that they have been, adul|terers, fornicators, oppre&s;&s;ors, extortioners, and the like. Such is the turpitude of the&s;e vices, and &s;uch the &s;uitablene&s;s in their nature, to excite &s;hame, that this pa&s;&s;ion, when they have commit|ted the&s;e abominations, and con&s;cience te&s;tifies to them that they have, will be put into mo|tion, in a le&s;s or greater degree, even by an e&s;|tabli&s;hed con&s;titution of heaven, till the very pa&s;&s;ion it&s;elf has been &s;o debilitated, as to have no power to rai&s;e a blu&s;h. And it is in kindne&s;s
<PB N="149" REF="018397_0147_0FA70C5046C3C020">
to the world, that the God of nature has im|planted in man this pa&s;&s;ion of &s;hame. It is one of the &s;tronge&s;t re&s;traints from an undue, wrong u&s;e of our moral liberty. And was it not for this powerful re&s;traint, mankind would be more abandoned to vicious conduct than they now are, as we may rea&s;onably conclude from the mad behaviour of tho&s;e, who, by their debau|cheries, have &s;o &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the operation of this pa&s;&s;ion, as that they are able, notwith&s;tanding its implantation in them, to commit abomina|tions in almo&s;t every kind, without being a&s;ham|ed of what they have done. But it may be worth remembering here, even the&s;e &s;hamele&s;s livers in the practice of vice may, upon &s;ome &s;olemn alarm in providence, have their con|&s;cience &s;o awakened, as to bear witne&s;s to their abu&s;e of their moral liberty in &s;o lively and powerful a manner, as to di&s;enable them to look back upon their pa&s;t follies without the emotion of &s;hame, and to a degree that will not &s;uffer them to live at ea&s;e. The exact truth is, Such is the moral deformity of vice, &s;uch its ignominious and di&s;graceful nature, that it is naturally fitted to excite &s;hame; and there will accordingly be the perception of it in the brea&s;ts of wicked men, whenever they live in the practice of it, and it is te&s;tified to them by con&s;cience that they have done &s;o, till by an habitual cour&s;e of immoral conduct, they have &s;o blinded their eyes, and &s;tupified their their hearts, as to be pa&s;t &s;eeing and feeling.</P>

A man that is born blind may feel the emotion of unea&s;ine&s;s on this account, he may be &s;orry, and wi&s;h he had not come into exi&s;tence with this defect; but he cannot reproach him&s;elf for it, or feel the lea&s;t degree of guilty remor&s;e: Whereas, if he lo&s;t his &s;ight by an intemperate, debauched cour&s;e of living, he will, if con&s;cience is &s;uffered to do its office, be &s;elf-condemned, and filled with bitter re&s;entments again&s;t him&s;elf. In like manner, if the lightning of heaven &s;hould de|&s;troy the life of his wife, or child, he would feel the working of grief, but not of &s;hame, or re|mor&s;e: Whereas, if he maliciou&s;ly laid violent hands on them, and &s;lew them, he would, if he was not a mon&s;ter, reproach and condemn him&s;elf, feeling that bitter remor&s;e which flows from great con&s;cious guilt. What now &s;hould be the rea&s;on of the&s;e different &s;en&s;ations? It can be no other than this, that there is a diffe|rence in the cau&s;e of their production. If a man had no power over his volitions, but they were the effects of invoilable nece&s;&s;ity, in virtue of a previous concatenation of cau&s;es, he would be no more to blame, nor could be any more

the &s;ubject of remor&s;e, than fire which occa&s;ions mi&s;chief, or a &s;tone that breaks a man's head by accidentally falling from &s;ome height.

<P>I now go on, in as brief a manner as I well can, farther to illu&s;trate the Divine benevolence

from the providential care he has taken, not only to perpetuate the exi&s;tence of percipient beings, in all their various cla&s;&s;es, but to &s;up|port them in life, and to render it, agreeably to their re&s;pective natures, comfortable and plea|&s;ant to them.</P>
<P>Exi&s;tence in our world is perpetuated, with re&s;pect to all the cla&s;&s;es of percipient beings, not by a continued prolongation of life in the &s;ame individuals, but by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of others of the &s;ame kind, in their room, as they, in va|rious periods, are taken off from the &s;tage of time. And an admirably wi&s;e and benevolent contrivance this is for the be&s;towment, and en|joyment, of more life and happine&s;s, than there could have been, if exi&s;tence had been perpetu|ated without death, in the &s;ame individuals; as we &s;hall have occa&s;ion hereafter to point out particularly. In the mean time, it is to be ob&s;erved, that this &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in percipient life is effected conformably to a general e&s;tabli&s;hed law, that of propagation, which extends to all orders of percipient beings, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t. Almighty God, without all doubt, could, if he had &s;o plea&s;ed, have con|&s;tantly &s;upplied the place of all individuals, of eve|ry &s;pecies, as they cea&s;ed to be here any longer, by bringing new ones into being, as he did the fir&s;t of our race, by immediate creation; but he cho&s;e rather to do it, by the intervention of &s;econd cau&s;es, operating under his influence and direction. It would have argued benevo|lence,

and to an high degree, had he perpetu|ated life and enjoyment in the former of the&s;e ways; but, as his benevolence is always mani|fe&s;ted under the guidance of wi&s;dom, he has preferred the latter of them; and with good rea&s;on. For amazing &s;kill and contrivance are di&s;played in carrying into effect this law of propagation; and it is &s;o done, in concurrence with other wi&s;ely contrived laws, as to &s;et off the goodne&s;s of God in the mo&s;t con&s;picuous lu&s;tre. This is a point we &s;hall more fully con&s;ider afterwards in its proper place. I &s;hall therefore only &s;ay at pre&s;ent, if the giving of life, and a capacity of enjoying happine&s;s, to va&s;tly various cla&s;&s;es of beings, with innume|rable individuals in every cla&s;s, is a proof of benevolence, it mu&s;t be a greatly enhanced evi|dence of it, to perpetuate this life, and capa|city of enjoyment, in &s;o many &s;ucce&s;&s;ions, through all ages, from the beginning of time. It will &s;urely betray blindne&s;s of intellectual &s;ight, or badne&s;s of heart, if we cannot di&s;cern the di&s;play of riches of goodne&s;s, in thus mak|ing provi&s;ion for prolonging, and multiplying, both life and happine&s;s to &s;uch millions of creatures.</P>
<P>The manife&s;tation of the Divine benevolence is likewi&s;e marvellou&s;ly con&s;picuous in the care God continually takes for the pre&s;ervation and comfort of life in all the cla&s;&s;es of percipient creatures, however numerous, when, by pro|pagation, they are brought into exi&s;tence.</P>

<P>The pre&s;erving providence of God extends even to vegetables, who, in all their kinds, and individuals, have life though with|out perception; which life is pre&s;erved and per|petuated by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and &s;o as to manife&s;t all-wi&s;e goodne&s;s, though not to tho&s;e exi&s;tences them&s;elves, not being capable of enjoyment, yet to others, who, together with life, are en|dowed with a perceptive power. Of the&s;e I am now more particularly &s;peaking, and they are all the providential care of a good God. He maintains life in them, in their nu|merous cla&s;&s;es, and &s;till more numerous indi|viduals, and carries it on to its appointed &s;tate of maturity and perfection, and all along with a balance of plea&s;ure in their favor.

It is true, they are both &s;upported, and provided for, by the intervention of &s;econd cau&s;es; but, far from le&s;&s;ening, this increa&s;es the greatne&s;s and glory of the Divine goodne&s;s. Did God immediately pre&s;erve and happily life in his creatures, the beneficence hereby di&s;played would be confined to a &s;ingle act of

his power only; but as he does this by a trai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of intervening means, and in&s;trumental cau&s;es, his goodne&s;s is, as it were, multiplied in pro|portion to the variety of the&s;e wi&s;ely adapted means and cau&s;es. For they are all in&s;tances of goodne&s;s, as truly as one immediate act of pow|er would be. A very &s;en&s;ible writer has per|tinently expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf upon this head, in the&s;e words; "whatever God effects by the interpo&s;ition of means, and a train of interme|diate cau&s;es, he could produce by his own im|mediate power. He wants not clouds to di&s;til rain, nor human indu&s;try to make the earth fruitful, nor the fruitfulne&s;s of the earth to &s;upply food, nor food to &s;u&s;tain life. He could do this by his own immediate power. But he choo&s;es to manife&s;t his providence, power, wi&s;dom, and goodne&s;s, in a variety of in&s;tances, and di&s;po&s;itions; and yet, his power and goodne&s;s are not only as much concerned, and exerci&s;ed, in this way, as if he produced the end without the intervention of means, but even much more: Becau&s;e his power, wi&s;dom, and goodne&s;s are as much exerted, and illu&s;tra|ted, in every &s;ingle intermediate &s;tep, as if he had done the thing at once, without any in|termediate &s;tep at all. There is as much pow|er, wi&s;dom, and goodne&s;s exerci&s;ed in produ|cing rain, or in making the earth fruitful, or in adapting food to the nouri&s;hment of our bo|dies: I &s;ay, there is as much power, wi&s;dom, and goodne&s;s, exerci&s;ed in any one of the&s;e
<PB N="159" REF="018397_0157_0FA70C5EBA397CB0">
&s;teps, as there would be in nouri&s;hing our bo|dies by one immediate act, without tho&s;e in|termediate means." In the method of prefer|ration therefore, which God has pitched upon, he has in admirable wi&s;dom contrived &s;o to exerci&s;e his goodne&s;s, as both to multiply and beautifully diver&s;ify the di&s;plays of it. For this is the real truth, with re&s;pect to every inter|mediate &s;tep in the way of pre&s;erving provi|dence. It is by vapors exhaled from the earth and &s;eas, by the heat of the &s;un, that the clouds are formed: it is from the clouds that the rain falls; it is by the rain, and other con|curring cau&s;es, that vegetables of every &s;pecies, with their individuals, are pre&s;erved in life and growth; it is by means of the&s;e vegetables, that innumerable multitudes of inferior perceptive creatures are &s;upplied with food; and it is from both the&s;e, that we men, the highe&s;t order of beings in this lower world, are nouri&s;hed and &s;upported in life and vigor. What an a&s;ton|i&s;hing train of intermediate in&s;trumental cau|&s;es are held out to view, as made u&s;e of in carrying on the great and important work of pre&s;ervation! And yet, every one of the&s;e in|&s;trumental cau&s;es, as intended, e&s;tabli&s;hed, and adapted, to accompli&s;h the pre&s;ervation of life, manife&s;t goodne&s;s, and to a marvellous degree, as truly as if it was effcted by one almighty act of immediate power; and as ju&s;tly gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e occa|&s;ion for grateful acknowledgments to that in|finitely benevolent being, who is thus good to

all his creatures, and continually &s;o, as he every moment concurs with each one of the&s;e vari|ous &s;ubordinate cau&s;es by who&s;e operation, un|der his influence, they are &s;o provided for as to be &s;upplied with the &s;upports of life.</P>
<P>It may with pertinency be added here, that the benevolence of God, had it not been di&s;played under the guidance of perfect wi&s;dom, would probably have pre&s;erved life, in the creatures to whom he had given it, in an immediate way by one continued &s;ingle act of power. But his goodne&s;s, as manife&s;ted in &s;uch a way, would have been le&s;s, far le&s;s, than in the way of in|&s;trumental means and cau&s;es, the way in which it is now done. In order to convey a clear and ju&s;t idea of this, let it be ob&s;erved,</P>
<P>It is not conceivable, how the inferior crea|tures, in any of their cla&s;&s;es, could have had plea&s;ure in life, had it been &s;upported without means, by a continued &s;ingle act of almighty power. For it is by the means employed in pre&s;erving their life, that they are the percipi|ents of mo&s;t of that enjoyment they are made capable of. Was it not for the food they live upon, and the &s;atisfaction they take in procur|ing, and then eating it, of what advantage would life be to them? In what way could they enjoy it, or be happy in its continuance to them? It is owing to the wi&s;dom of God, in &s;o contriv|ing to pre&s;erve their life, as that his goodne&s;s is not only manife&s;ted, but the manife&s;tation of it is multiplied in proportion to the multiplication

of the means that are u&s;ed to this end, for that the&s;e means give ri&s;e to the delight they take in life. Had your life been pre&s;erved by an immediate act of power, where &s;hould we have looked for the happine&s;s proper to their re|&s;pective natures? Their life, &s;o far as we are able to judge, mu&s;t have been pre&s;erved in vain. There would have been nothing, which could have yielded them plea&s;ure.

<P>And the &s;ame may be &s;aid of us men, &s;o far as we agree with the inferior creatures, as to our animal part. We, as truly as they, are &s;o made with re&s;pect to our bodies, that life, con|&s;idered as bodily only, would have yielded us, comparatively, little or no delight, had it been &s;upported by an immediate exertion of the pow|er of God. There would, in this ca&s;e, have been no room for tho&s;e in&s;trumental, &s;econdary cau&s;es, in the admini&s;tration of providence, which are now, not only the means by which we are continued in bodily life, but the means al&s;o by which our life, in this view of it, is ren|dered plea&s;ant and happy to us. To what purpo&s;e was the wi&s;dom of God employed, in &s;o curiou&s;ly contriving our bodily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">culties, and adapting &s;o great a variety of objects to give

them plea&s;ure, if it was not, that he might di&s;|play his goodne&s;s, and the riches of it, by pre|&s;erving life in a way, that &s;hould be clo&s;ely connected with making it, at the &s;ame time, de|&s;irably &s;weet and plea&s;ant? And this goodne&s;s of his is enlarged in proportion to the number, variety, and adaptation of tho&s;e objects, which are, at once, the means both of pre&s;erving life, and rendering it more happy than it could have been, in the way of power immediately exert|ed from above.</P>
<P>But the goodne&s;s of God, in the work of pre&s;ervation, with re&s;pect to us men, is not confined, as it is in regard of the inferior crea|tures, to the animal plea&s;ure only, which he has connected with his continuing us in life, and the mediate way in which he does it. For, as we are endowed with intellectual and moral powers, as well as bodily &s;en&s;es and appetites, we are made capable of happine&s;s, and in a no|ble degree, by the exerci&s;e of the&s;e powers upon the very means, and in&s;trumental cau&s;es, by which we are &s;upported in life. The amazing contrivance God has manife&s;ted, in the forma|tion of our bodies with &s;en&s;es and appetites, and in the adaptation of &s;uch a multiplicity of ob|jects to give them &s;atisfaction within rea&s;ona|ble limits, is a va&s;tly plentiful &s;ource of plea|&s;ure to the mind, as well as body, but in a far &s;uperior and more exalted kind. Is the body &s;o fitted, by its make, to be &s;upported, and, at the &s;ame time, delighted by this variety of
<PB N="163" REF="018397_0161_0FA70C64FAD63D98">
objects, the mind al&s;o is &s;o framed, as to be capable of being much more delighted in the view it may take of the riches of wi&s;dom and &s;kill, the Deity has manife&s;ted in &s;o contriving the method of &s;u&s;tentation, as that, by means of it, we may enjoy the happine&s;s that is &s;uited to the nature of intelligent, as well as animal beings. The con&s;titution, indeed, of the earth we live on is &s;uch, that mo&s;t of its producti|ons appear to have been intended, as they are well adapted, to carry into effect the work of pre&s;ervation, &s;o as that, we might not only be &s;upported by a va&s;t variety de&s;irable for food, raiment, and the rea&s;onable gratification of our bodily appetites, but that we might al&s;o take occa&s;ion, even from this very way in which our bodily life is &s;upported, and with plea&s;ure, &s;o to exerci&s;e our mental powers, as that, unle&s;s it be owning to our&s;elves, we may be even more happy as intelligent, than animal crea|tures. And we may be &s;till more happy as moral beings. For among all the objects in nature, though they are inconceivably multi|plied with variety, there is not one that is &s;uited to the pre&s;ervation and comfort of life, and made u&s;e of by the Deity to this purpo&s;e, but what affords ju&s;t matter for, and a powerful excite|ment to, tho&s;e religious, devotional, grateful acknowledgments to our daily pre&s;erver and benefactor, which con&s;titute no &s;mall part of that moral happine&s;s we are made capable of. There are, perhaps, few truly pious per&s;ons, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

They certainly might; and if they have not, it mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the dullne&s;s of their moral per|ception, or a faulty perver&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>The truth is, had the pre&s;ervation of life, in the creatures on whom God has be&s;towed ex|i&s;tenc&eacute; in this world, been affected by a &s;ingle continued exertion of Almighty power, there would not have been that multiplied manife&s;|tation of the Divine goodne&s;s, which we have now &s;o much rea&s;on to admire, and be thank|ful for. The alwi&s;e God, no doubt, could have made man, and the other percipient be|ings on earth, and pre&s;erved them in life, by an immediate act of power; but then their make, and the way in which they might be fitted for the enjoyment of happine&s;s, mu&s;t have been, in many re&s;pects, different from what it now is, and the whole con&s;titution of the world al&s;o mu&s;t have been modelled upon a different plan. Po&s;&s;ibly, there may be &s;uch creatures, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ri&s;ting in &s;uch a world. But for &s;uch crea|tures as exi&s;t in &s;uch a world as our's, prefer|vation in life, not by &s;econdary in&s;trumental cau&s;es, but an immediate exertion of power, would be &s;o far from increa&s;ing, that it would le&s;&s;en, the manife&s;tations of the Divine benevo|lence.

would be confined to one act only, whereas, in the latter, it is manife&s;ted in every intermediate &s;tep, and is con&s;equently diver&s;i|fied, and multiplied, in proportion to the num|ber, and variety of them.</P>
<P>There is yet, in the admini&s;tration of provi|dence, another proof of the Divine goodne&s;s, and a more &s;triking one, to tho&s;e who are belie|vers in revelation, than any that have been mentioned. It is the redemption of man by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>This great work of God, as we are told in the &s;criptures, from whence alone all our knowledge of this matter mu&s;t be fetched, took ri&s;e from his rich love, and di&s;intere&s;ted good will towards the race of man. The infinitely good God, if we may depend upon the bible, was not exci|ted to purpo&s;e, or contrive, or reveal, or exe|cute the go&s;pel-plan of &s;alvation, by any mo|tive extraneous to him&s;elf; but benevolence of heart was the true &s;ource, and the only one, from whence it all proceeded. Had not God been moved by the e&s;&s;ential, immen&s;e goodne&s;s of his own nature, he would not have come in|to it. The movement hereto was within him&s;elf. He con&s;ulted his own bowels of love and mercy, and from hence it was, that he employed his wi&s;dom to contrive it. It &s;prang from this &s;ource antecedently to all other con&s;iderations whatever.</P>

<P>The incarnation, obedience, &s;ufferings, and death of Chri&s;t are therefore to be con&s;idered as the way, or method, in which the wi&s;dom of God thought fit to bring into event the redemp|tion of man. And a mo&s;t wi&s;ely concerted me|thod it is. In this way, mankind are obvi|ou&s;ly led into ju&s;t &s;entiments of the vile nature, and de&s;tructive de&s;ert of &s;in; as al&s;o of that &s;a|cred regard, which God will forever &s;hew to the honor of his own governing authority: Nor could they, in any way, have been more powerfully engaged to turn from their iniqui|ties, and &s;ubmit to the government of heaven, as preparatives without which they can have no rea&s;onable hope of being happy. Perhaps, there is nothing more powerfully &s;uited to work on the human mind, impre&s;&s;ing it with an holy awe and reverence of the Divine Ma|je&s;ty, hatred of &s;in and re&s;olutions to for&s;ake it, than a &s;erious turn of thought to the &s;orrows and &s;uffer|ings of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, appointed by the wi&s;dom of an infinitely benevolent God, as the only way, in which he has judged it expedient to admit his offending creatures to the benefit of a par|don.

of humiliation, as the only method conforma|bly to which the alwi&s;e God, though infinite|ly good, has thought fit to make the grant of forgiving mercy?</P>
<P>Though this method of our redemption by Je&s;us Chri&s;t appears to be a wi&s;ely concerted one for the di&s;play of the Divine benevolence, on account of the rea&s;ons we have mentioned; yet we may, at pre&s;ent, be ignorant of other rea|&s;ons which concur to make it &s;o. We mu&s;t indeed be acquainted with the whole affair of redemption, that is, with the whole effect that would have been con&s;equent upon &s;in, and the whole effect of deliverance from it, and this throughout our whole exi&s;tence; and we mu&s;t al&s;o be acquainted with all the ways, in which there may be a connection between the medi|ating work of Chri&s;t, and &s;alvation, before we may, with any face of propriety, pretend per|fectly to &s;ee into the wi&s;dom of this method of God's manife&s;ting his benevolence. It may be a mean mo&s;t wi&s;ely connected with its propo&s;ed end in ways unthought of by us at pre&s;ent. Nor is this an objection of any weight again&s;t its fitne&s;s as a mean well adapted to accom|pli&s;h its end. For it is a certain truth; that moral means often look forward to di&s;tant fu|turity, and the wi&s;dom of their connection, with the end to be effected by them, is not di&s;cern|ed, at lea&s;t in perfection, till the end and the means can be compared with each other. The &s;tate of things, for in&s;tance, under the Mo&s;aic
<PB N="169" REF="018397_0167_0FA70C69229FB560">
di&s;pen&s;ation, was, according to the new-te&s;ta|ment repre&s;entation, a moral mean in order to &s;ome future, di&s;tant end; and its fitne&s;s, as &s;uch, was little under&s;tood till the di&s;pen&s;ation of the Me&s;&s;ias: Nor is it yet &s;o clearly and fully perceived, as perhaps it may be, even in this world, in the coming days of greater light and knowledge, and certainly will be in that world, where we &s;hall "know even as we are known." And this is undoubtedly the ca&s;e, with reference to the method of our &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. It was contrived by God, in order to his wi&s;ely di&s;playing his benevolence towards &s;inners. And the &s;cripture has &s;aid enough to &s;atisfy us for the pre&s;ent, that it is a wi&s;e and fit method, par|ticularly in tho&s;e ways wherein we have &s;hewn it to be &s;o: But there is no need of &s;uppo&s;ing, that it has fully revealed the whole of what may be known in another world, tending to il|lu&s;trate the wi&s;dom of it; what I mean is, that revelation may not have explained in direct, and po&s;itively clear and full terms, wherein "the obedience of Chri&s;t to death" has virtue and efficacy in the affair of man's redemption, as a wi&s;e, fit, and benevolent mean in order to this end. And, perhaps, it might not be con|venient it &s;hould, had it been po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>But &s;ome may &s;ay, this method of &s;alvation, through the mediatory doings and &s;ufferings of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in&s;tead of magnifying the benevo|lence of the Deity, is rather a dimination of it, if not an incon&s;i&s;tency with it. And &s;o it really
<PB N="170" REF="018397_0168_0FA70C69C8AE0008">
would be, if God had wanted pity, and the de|&s;ign of the mediation of Chri&s;t had been to excite it in him; but this was no part of the intention of his undertaking for &s;inners. For it was God who &s;ent him upon this work; and he was moved to it from his own bowels of mercy. His own infinite benevolence of heart put him upon it: Nor &s;hould we ever have heard of Chri&s;t, or of the way of redemption through him, if the motive hereto had not been within the brea&s;t of God. This is the account the &s;cripture always gives of the matter. Says our Savior him&s;elf, "God &s;o loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that who|&s;oever believeth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h but have everla&s;ting life." Every word in this text is emphatically expre&s;&s;ive of the truth we are upon." God &s;o loved the world," &s;o greatly, &s;o inconceivably; was &s;o moved by the origi|nal, e&s;&s;ential, and eternal goodne&s;s of his na|ture, that "he gave," that is, of meer mercy and free favor; without any thing obliging, or con&s;training him hereto; he gave "his only begotten &s;on," and for this mo&s;t benevolent end, that "who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life." You ob&s;erve, the gift of Chri&s;t, through which we have redemption, &s;prang originally from the love of God. His own merciful nature put him upon the be&s;towment of this gift, and upon no le&s;s a de&s;ign than the &s;aving of men from de&s;truc|tion, and opening a way for their admi&s;&s;ion to
<PB N="171" REF="018397_0169_0FA70C6B7775A1C0">
life and immortality in heaven. The &s;ame ac|count is frequently to be met with el&s;ewhere in the new-te&s;tament books. Says the apo&s;tle Paul, "God commendeth his love towards us, in that, while we were yet &s;inners, Chri&s;t died for us." You perceive at once, that God's love is here repre&s;ented as that which gave ri&s;e even to Chri&s;t's dying for us. To the like purpo&s;e is that declaration of the apo&s;tle John, "In this was manife&s;ted the love of God towards us, becau&s;e that God &s;ent his only begotten &s;on into the world, that we might live through him." And the &s;ame thing is either expre&s;&s;|ed, or implied in many other pa&s;&s;ages in &s;crip|ture, which it would be needle&s;s to mention. And wherein could the Deity have more illu&s;tri|ou&s;ly di&s;played the greatne&s;s of his benevolence, than by the con&s;titution of his own &s;on to be the medium through whom &s;alvation &s;hould be communicated to us?</P>
<P>It may perhaps be &s;aid, Had God, by one &s;in|gle act of free, &s;overeign grace, without any in|tervening means, proclaimed his readine&s;s to pardon &s;inners, and admit them to his favorable notice, would he not have manife&s;ted more goodne&s;s, have more, con&s;picuou&s;ly di&s;played the riches of his grace, than he could have done in any other way?</P>
<P>It would, no doubt, have been evidential of goodne&s;s, if God had thus made an ab&s;olute &s;o|vereign grant of pardoning, &s;aving mercy to the &s;inful &s;ons of men; but there would in this way,
<PB N="172" REF="018397_0170_0FA70C6C3B7FFAB8">
have been a far le&s;s manife&s;tation of it, than in the method the go&s;pel reveals. Had the work of pre&s;erving providence been effected by a &s;in|gle act of almighty power, though it would have argued goodne&s;s it would not have done it, as has been &s;hewn, with &s;uch con&s;picuous variety, and enlargedne&s;s, as by the interven|tion of means, and in&s;trumental cau&s;es. The &s;ame may be &s;aid, with like truth, of the work of redemption. As it is carried into effect, not by an ab&s;olute &s;overeign grant from God, but in a mediate way, his benevolence is more glori|ou&s;ly illu&s;trated than it otherwi&s;e would, or could, have been. For it is as true, with re|&s;pect to redeeming grace, as pre&s;erving good|ne&s;s, that it is inhanced by every intervening &s;tep by which it is carried on, and in proporti|on to the number and important worth of the&s;e &s;teps. It argues benevolence in God, that he &s;hould find within him&s;elf an heart to enter|tain a thought of &s;aving &s;inful man; his bene|volence is greater, in that he &s;hould be willing to &s;end his own Son, from heaven into our world, in order to accompli&s;h this purpo&s;e of his heart; the benevolence is &s;till heightened, in &s;ending him, though "in the form of God," to take upon him "the fa&s;hion of a man;" and it ri&s;es beyond all conception, when we behold this Son of his love, after he had a&s;&s;u|med human nature, "becoming obedient to death, the death of the cro&s;s," hereby making way for the be&s;towment of pardoning, &s;aving

mercy, &s;o as that the be&s;towment of it &s;hould be honorary to his perfections, and the autho|rity of his government as Ruler of the world. Surely, the goodne&s;s, as well as wi&s;dom of God, are di&s;played much more illu&s;triou&s;ly in this me|diate way, than if it had been effected by one meer &s;overeign act of grace!

<HEAD>PART III. An&s;wering the principal objections which have been urged again&s;t the benevolence of the Deity.</HEAD>
<P>THE traces of goodne&s;s are &s;o vi&s;ible, in every part of the creation we know any thing about, particularly in this world of our's, and in the formation of man, his implanted fa|culties, and the methods by which, according to e&s;tabli&s;hed laws, under the government of providence, they may be improved to his be|ing as perfect and happy as can rea&s;onably be de&s;ired, that it is &s;trange any &s;hould call in que&s;tion the Creator's benevolence: And yet, no one of his attributes have been more vio|lently attacked. The great difficulty objected, is the evil there is in the world. This world of our's, and mankind in particular, its noble&s;t inhabitants, which are repre&s;ented as monuments of the Deity's goodne&s;s, are mentioned as proofs of a deficiency in this very point.</P>
<P>Say the&s;e objectors, if an infinitely benevo|lent Being is the Supreme Creator, and Ruler, whence came tho&s;e imperfections, and po&s;itive evils, which abound in the world, and which all ranks of creatures are &s;ubjected to? How &s;hall we account for the mi&s;eries, in innumera|ble kinds, which men in particular lie groan|ing
<PB N="175" REF="018397_0173_0FA70C6E4D2A6450">
under? What &s;hall we &s;ay of the many di&s;|ea&s;es, accompanied with torment of body, and angui&s;h of mind, to which they are liable, and which finally put an end to their pre&s;ent &s;tate of exi&s;tence? And could the&s;e things be ac|counted for, who can reconcile that <HI>moral</HI> ir|regularity, which has been introduced into the world, and its direful effects, with the &s;uper-in|tending agency and government of a being ab&s;olutely holy and good?</P>
<P>This, in general, is the difficulty pleaded. And a very great one it is; but a difficulty, it may be worth remarking, as we pa&s;s along, not levelled again&s;t Chri&s;tians only, or the religion they profe&s;s, but again&s;t all religion, natural as well as revealed: In&s;omuch, that let men's religion be what it may, whether they are Jews or Hea|thens, Dei&s;ts or Chri&s;tians, they are equally em|barra&s;&s;ed with it. For it being a &s;ure fact, that &s;in and mi&s;ery are in the world, if they believe that a wi&s;e and good God made and governs it, they are all under like obligations to do what they can to reconcile the&s;e two things, which have &s;uch an appearance of in|con&s;i&s;tency with each other. And this accor|dingly has been the endeavor of per&s;ons of all different religions, in all parts of the world. <HI>Whence came evil?</HI> has indeed, in all ages, been a perplexing que&s;tion; and no one, it may be, has more puzzled the greate&s;t pre|tenders to rea&s;on, as well as religion.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="018397_0174_0FA70C71A4ED9918">It was this that gave ri&s;e to the &s;cheme of <HI>two independent oppo&s;ite principles</HI> in the univer&s;e; the one good, from wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m is derived every thing that is good; the other evil, from whom is derived every thing that is evil, whether natural or moral. It is ob&s;ervable, even this Manichean notion, however ridiculous, is yet founded on the &s;uppo&s;ition of &s;uch evidences of goodne&s;s in the creation, as are too glaring to be denied. The fault therefore of the &s;y&s;tem is, not &s;o much that it di&s;putes the exi&s;tence of a benevolent cau&s;e, as that it weakly imagines the exi&s;tence of ano|ther oppo&s;ite one, equally powerful and inde|pendent; the &s;uppo&s;ition of which two co-or|dinate Deities looks too much like an arbitrary contrivance, invented only for the &s;ake of re|moving away the difficulty ari&s;ing from the appearance of evil. To be &s;ure, it is an opi|nion &s;o far from being founded on &s;olid proof, that it cannot be &s;upported by any argument fetched from the principles of true rea&s;on. It is indeed a &s;cheme utterly de&s;tructive of it&s;elf. For the&s;e two oppo&s;ite principles being, by &s;uppo|&s;ition, perfectly equal, it is impo&s;&s;ible there &s;hould have been, either good or evil, unle&s;s by their mu|tual con&s;ent in operation; and it is impo&s;&s;ible al&s;o there &s;hould have been this con&s;ent, upon any other plan than that, of the production of good and evil in equal proportions. And is this the truth of fact? So far from it, that, in the whole circle of exi&s;tence, there is no ap|pearance of &s;uch equality. The truth is, the
<PB N="177" REF="018397_0175_0FA70C73DE49A1B0">
uniform, invariable tendency of nature, with re&s;pect to all the creatures we know any thing of, is their perfection and happine&s;s within their proper &s;phere: Nor can it be truly &s;aid of any &s;pecies of creatures that they do not ac|tually attain to the enjoyment of good, much out-weighing the evil they are obliged to &s;uf|fer; which could not have been the ca&s;e, if there was exi&s;ting an evil power of opera|tion equal to the good one. Some of the crea|tures, upon this hypothe&s;is, mu&s;t have carried the marks of the evil principles that produced them, in the tendency of their con&s;titution to mi&s;e|ry, balancing the tendency of it to good: Other|wi&s;e, there would not be an equality in the ex|ertions of the&s;e oppo&s;ite equal powers.&mdash;But I need not enlarge in the refutation of &s;o pal|pable an ab&s;urdity. However, the difficulty, which occa&s;ioned it, de&s;erves to be &s;eriou&s;ly and thoroughly debated. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this will be more clearly and intelligibly done, by going over its &s;everal parts, and treating them di&s;tinctly as &s;o many objections.</P>
<P>Only, it may be fit to make one previous general remark, which I e&s;teem an important one, and de&s;ire may be kept in mind through the whole that may follow. It is this; that no objection ought to be e&s;teemed &s;ufficient to &s;et a&s;ide the po&s;itive proof, that has been given of the Deity's benevolence, which, when thoroughly examined, will be found finally to terminate in IGNORANCE. What I mean is, that no appear|ance
<PB N="178" REF="018397_0176_0FA70C74E526C1E8">
in nature, capable of being alledged, ought to be looked upon as conclu&s;ively arguing an <HI>incon&s;i&s;tency</HI> with goodne&s;s, MEERLY or ONLY becau&s;e we may not be able particularly and ful|ly to point out their con&s;i&s;tency with each other: I &s;ay, meerly or only for this rea&s;on, becau&s;e there is an evident difference between our not particularly di&s;cerning wherein the <HI>con&s;i&s;tency</HI> of two things lies, and clearly perceiving that there is a <HI>real incon&s;i&s;tency</HI> between them.

No eye but God's can take in the <HI>whole &s;cheme</HI> of creation and providence. And therefore it is probable, the highe&s;t order of created beings are inca|pable of &s;eeing perfectly into the rea&s;ons of the Divine conduct. Much le&s;s may it be thought,
<PB N="179" REF="018397_0177_0FA70C74F80B2330">
that this &s;hould be the privilege of &s;uch com|paratively low, weak creatures as we are. So far are we from comprehending the connection of the univer&s;e in its various parts, their mu|tual dependence on, and &s;ubordination to, each other, that our knowledge is confined to a few beings and things in it, and to a very &s;mall part of the &s;cheme of God, even with re&s;pect to the&s;e. And &s;hall it then be counted an objection of any weight again&s;t the goodne&s;s of God's works, that we are not able, in every in&s;tance, to &s;ee wherein they are connected with <HI>good?</HI> Ought it not rather, to be concluded, as to &s;uch in|&s;tances, that the defect lies, not in the tendency of God's works, but in our incapacity to connect them together, and view them in the reference they bear to each other? This is certain|ly no more than a fit expre&s;&s;ion of humility and mode&s;ty in &s;uch &s;hort-&s;ighted creatures as we are. And it were to be wi&s;hed, that our inqui|ries into the mea&s;ures of the Divine conduct were more generally made under the habitual influence of the&s;e principles.

I am &s;en&s;ible, that humility duly regu|lated by rea&s;on and religion, as it ought al|ways to be, is no enemy to the free&s;t debates not tho&s;e which relate even to the proceedings, of <HI>God.</HI> It is the pretence of humility, not the principle it&s;elf, that makes an out-cry again&s;t &s;uch inquiries. And to this fal&s;e humility, at lea&s;t in part, it may be owing, that &s;o many ab|&s;urdities, horribly reproachful to the nature and government of <HI>God,</HI> have been embraced in the world. It has doubtle&s;s too often be|trayed men into &s;uper&s;tition and bigotry, giving them a mean, abject ca&s;t of mind, whereby their intellectual faculties have been very much unfitted for the right di&s;charge of their proper office.

But then, it ought to be acknowled|ged, on the other hand, that if the&s;e <HI>appear|ances,</HI> in their la&s;t re&s;ult, center in <HI>ignorance,</HI> and only prove that our capacities are &s;canty, and not formed to take in the whole of what is proper to be con&s;idered in the ca&s;e; and that <HI>good,</HI> the <HI>greate&s;t good,</HI> may be the production of the&s;e <HI>appearances,</HI> in the end, for all that we know, or can prove, to the contrary; I &s;ay, in this view of the matter, it ought to be ingenu|ou&s;ly confe&s;&s;ed, that <HI>&s;uch appearances,</HI> in &s;trict rea&s;oning, conclude nothing again&s;t the <HI>benevo|lence</HI> of the <HI>Deity.</HI> For this is certainly the truth of the ca&s;e. And all the reproach that is re|flected on the Divine goodne&s;s by this kind of arguing can rea&s;onably be looked upon as no other than the effect of <HI>ignorance</HI>; not to &s;ay pride and arrogant pre&s;umption, in taking upon us to judge and determine in matters &s;o evi|dently beyond the reach of our powers.</P>
<P>This general ob&s;ervation, which I believe no one will deny to be ju&s;t, I e&s;teem fully &s;uf|ficient to an&s;wer the general objection again&s;t the <HI>benevolence</HI> of the <HI>Deity,</HI> which has been brought from the appearances of evil in the cre|ation.
<PB N="183" REF="018397_0181_0FA70C77F3F986D8">
However, I &s;hall not content my&s;elf with this general reply, but proceed to a di&s;tinct con&s;ideration of the particular objections con|tained in the general one above-mentioned. And they may be reduced to the&s;e three, the <HI>im|perfect powers</HI> of &s;o many of the creatures who are capable of happine&s;s; the <HI>moral di&s;orders</HI> which have taken place in the world; and the <HI>natural evils</HI> which are &s;o numerous, and turn &s;o much to the di&s;advantage, e&s;pecially of <HI>man.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t objection again&s;t the infinite be|nevolence of the Deity is taken from the <HI>imper|fection</HI> of &s;o many of the creatures on this earth of our's. What a diminutive creature, com|paratively &s;peaking, is even man, the mo&s;t per|fect of them all? How &s;mall his capacity for happine&s;s? And how much &s;maller &s;till the capacities of the inferior perceiving beings, through their &s;everal ranks, in the de|&s;cending &s;cale, of &s;ubordination? And could it be thus, if God was infinitely good? Could not an infinitely benevolent Cre|ator have communicated nobler capacities for happine&s;s? And if he could, how can his not doing it be reconciled with the idea of him as an infinitely benevolent Being?</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this difficulty, it may be &s;aid, the bringing into exi&s;tence an ab&s;olutely per|fect creature is not within the reach of infi|nite goodne&s;s, aided by almighty power. The very idea of a creature is e&s;&s;entially connected with comparative imperfection; as it derives
<PB N="184" REF="018397_0182_0FA70C7B2D582780">
its being from another, is dependent on that other for its continuance in being, and is ne|ce&s;&s;arily finite in its nature and powers. To &s;up|po&s;e a created being infinite, would be to &s;up|po&s;e it equal with its Creator; which is too ab&s;urd to be admitted. Ab&s;olute perfection therefore is an incommunicable glory of the only true God. And &s;hould there be a crea|tion, comparative imperfection mu&s;t exi&s;t in it, otherwi&s;e it could not exi&s;t at all. Con&s;equently, if &s;uch imperfection is an evil, it is &s;uch an one as mu&s;t take place, or there could be no di&s;|play of the Divine benevolence. &mdash;But the truth is, meer imperfection is no evil, to be &s;ure no po&s;itive one: Nor may God, with the lea&s;t propriety, be con&s;idered as the author of it. This matter has been &s;et in a clear and &s;trong point of light by Arch-Deacon Law, in his 32d. Note on Arch-Bi&s;hop King's "origin of evil." His words are the&s;e, "God is the cau&s;e of perfection only, not of defect, which &s;o far forth as it is <HI>natural</HI> to created beings hath no cau&s;e at all, but is meerly a <HI>negation,</HI> or <HI>non-entity.</HI> For every created thing was a negation or non-entity, before it had a po&s;itive being, and it had only &s;o much of its primitive nega|tion taken away from it, as it had po&s;itive be|ing conferred on it; and therefore, &s;o far forth as it is, its being is to be attributed to the &s;o|vereign cau&s;e that produced it: But &s;o far forth as it is not, its not being is to be attri|buted to the original <HI>non-entity</HI> out of which it
<PB N="185" REF="018397_0183_0FA70C7D591B2B78">
was produced. For that which was once no|thing would &s;till have been nothing, had it not been for the cau&s;e that gave being to it; and therefore, that it is &s;o far nothing &s;till, that is, limitted and defective, is only to be attribu|ted to its own primitive nothingne&s;s. As for in|&s;tance, if I give a poor man a hundred pounds, that he is worth &s;o much money is wholly owing to me, but that he is not worth an hun|dred more is owing wholly to his own pover|ty. And ju&s;t &s;o, that I have &s;uch and &s;uch perfections of being is wholly owing to God, who produced me out of nothing; but that I have &s;uch and &s;uch defects of being is only owing to that <HI>non-entity</HI> out of which he produced me."</P>
<P>It will probably be &s;aid here, we &s;ee in the creation innumerable beings with implanted faculties, making them the capable percipients of happine&s;s in indefinitely various degrees, &s;ome in an higher, others in a lower, till we have got down to the lowe&s;t we can conceive of. Can this be the work of an infinitely benevo|lent Being? Would he have made &s;o many crea|tures &s;o imperfect, as to be capable of happine&s;s in &s;uch low degrees only? If it was his plea&s;ure to bring beings into exi&s;tence, from non-entity, would he not if infinitely good, have endowed them with higher and more noble capacities for happine&s;s? The obvious an&s;wer is this, if in a creation, in which there are beings inconcei|vably various in their capacities for happine&s;s, there may be the communication of MORE
<PB N="186" REF="018397_0184_0FA70C7ED63D0DE0">
GOOD, than could otherwi&s;e have been com|municated, it is &s;o far from being an objection again&s;t the Divine benevolence, that the&s;e be|ings of lower capacities for the enjoyment of happine&s;s were brought into exi&s;tence, that it is at once an illu&s;tration, and &s;trong proof of it. It is readily owned, if the whole re&s;ult of com|municated good was nothing more than the production of &s;uch imperfect beings, as are ca|pable of happine&s;s in a low mea&s;ure only, it might be thought the Deity, if infinite in benevo|lence, had been wanting in the manife&s;tation of it. But, if there are other beings gradually ri&s;ing, in the &s;cale of exi&s;tence, to an incon|ceivable height in their capacities for the en|joyment of happine&s;s, and of the mo&s;t &s;uperior kind too, why &s;hould it be thought &s;trange, that there &s;hould be imperfect ones al&s;o, in the like gradually de&s;cending &s;cale? E&s;pecially, if they are all con&s;idered as parts of &s;ome GREAT WHOLE, &s;everally concurring to make one uni|ver&s;al, gloriou&s;ly connected &s;y&s;tem, capable of yielding as much good, as the infinitely be|nevolent Being, guided in his exertions by unerring wi&s;dom, has thought fit to commu|nicate.</P>
<P>In this view of the matter, it is not nece&s;|&s;ary, that every &s;y&s;tem making the univer&s;al one, or that every creature in each &s;y&s;tem, &s;hould be equally perfect. For, though, with re&s;pect to particular &s;y&s;tems, and beings, com|pared with one another, there &s;hould be ever
<PB N="187" REF="018397_0185_0FA70C7F78FF33A8">
&s;o great a <HI>diver&s;ity</HI>; yet this ought not, in rea|&s;on, to be e&s;teemed an objection again&s;t the Divine benevolence, if, upon the whole, there is the di&s;play of as much good as infinite wi&s;|dom has thought proper: Nay, upon &s;uppo&s;ition there may, in this way, be the communication of <HI>more good,</HI> than in any other, it would be an objection again&s;t infinite benevolence, if it was not in this way di&s;played. The creation is, in fact, a <HI>diver&s;ified</HI> one. It therefore lies up|on the objectors again&s;t the benevolence of the Deity to make it appear, that <HI>le&s;s good</HI> is capa|ble of being communicated upon this plan, than might have been upon &s;ome other. Until this is done, which never will be, as it has never yet been, no complaint can rea&s;onably be made again&s;t the Deity, as having been wanting in his benevolence, on account of bringing into exi&s;tence a creation, <HI>diver&s;ified</HI> in the manner we &s;ee this is in which we hold our beings.</P>
<P>There are only two ways in general, in which an infinitely benevolent cau&s;e is &s;uppo&s;ed capa|ble of exerting it&s;elf in the communication of good. One is, by di&s;plays ad ultimum po&s;&s;e, that is, to the utmo&s;t in all in&s;tances whatever; the effect of which di&s;plays would be one or|der only of beings, the mo&s;t perfect there can be. But this &s;uppo&s;ition is, perhaps, an im|po&s;&s;ible one, as it carries with it that which looks very like a contradiction. That which is infi|nite is unlimited, and not to be re&s;trained with|in any bounds. To &s;uppo&s;e therefore a <HI>ne plus</HI>
<PB N="188" REF="018397_0186_0FA70C80597760F0">
of exertion in an infinite being, is to &s;uppo&s;e that this being is re&s;trained within certain limits; which &s;eems to contradict his being infinite. If the Deity is infinitely benevolent, his exertions in manife&s;ting the glory of this attribute can ne|ver be exhau&s;ted. To &s;uppo&s;e otherwi&s;e, would be to &s;uppo&s;e that he was not thus infinite, &s;trictly and properly &s;peaking, the word <HI>utmo&s;t,</HI> or any other word of &s;imilar &s;ignification, can|not be applied to an infinite being, with re&s;pect to any of his communications. He ought rather to be conceived of, as having with|in him&s;elf an ability to go on communicating to eternity. Communications <HI>to the utmo&s;t,</HI> &s;o far as we are able to conceive of the matter, are incompatible with the idea of an infinite ability to communicate. Be&s;ides, &s;hould the benevolence of the Deity (was this po&s;&s;ible) be di&s;played in all in&s;tances to the <HI>utmo&s;t,</HI> this at|tribute of his would appear more like a <HI>natural in&s;tinct,</HI> mechanically and blindly urging him on to the communication of happine&s;s, than a <HI>mo|ral di&s;po&s;ition,</HI> immutably guided in all its ex|ertions by unerring wi&s;dom, and in con&s;i&s;tency with un&s;potted rectitude.&mdash;The other way of the Deity's communicating good, may be by limited di&s;plays of it, in particular in&s;tances; the con&s;equence of which might be the produc|tion of creatures indefinitely <HI>diver&s;ified</HI> in their powers; &s;ome capable of happine&s;s in one de|gree, others in another, and &s;o on, in a gra|dual a&s;cention, without di&s;continuity, to the
<PB N="189" REF="018397_0187_0FA70C811E847C18">
highe&s;t conceivable perfection. This, I &s;ay, may be the effect of limited exertions of bene|volence, in an infinitely productive cau&s;e, with re&s;pect to the particular parts of &s;ome great and good whole. And the rea&s;on is obvious at fir&s;t view. For if any one conceivable degree of imper|fection will argue a defect in the exertions of an infinitely benevolent Being, another will argue the &s;ame thing with equal truth, and no &s;top can be made till we have got to the highe&s;t created perfection. If a low reptile, for in&s;tance, cannot be the production of an infinitely be|nevolent cau&s;e, becau&s;e le&s;s perfect than a man; a man, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, could not have had exi&s;tence, becau&s;e le&s;s perfect than an angel; and an angel, for the &s;ame rea&s;on &s;till, could not have been made, becau&s;e le&s;s perfect than &s;ome being of a yet &s;uperior order; and &s;o on, till there are no creatures but of the highe&s;t, and mo&s;t perfect cla&s;s in the creation. So that, if there can be any limited exertions of Divine benevolence, there are no creatures, be their capacities for happine&s;s as low as any in na|ture, but may have exi&s;tence in a &s;cale of beings, which &s;hall gradually a&s;cend to as high perfec|tion as infinite benevolence, guided by infinite wi&s;dom, &s;hall think fit to create.</P>
<P>The only inquiry then is, which of the&s;e &s;orts of exertion are capable of yielding, upon the whole, the mo&s;t good. And it will not be denied, that the pre&s;umption is &s;trong in favor of the latter; as they actually take place in a
<PB N="190" REF="018397_0188_0FA70C81CE973AC0">
world, that will readily be owned to be the effect of infinite benevolence, conducted by unerring wi&s;dom, if it be po&s;&s;ible, that <HI>more good</HI> &s;hould be the re&s;ult of &s;uch exertions, than of any other within the reach of our ability to point out. And that this is not only po&s;&s;i|ble, but highly probable, if not certain, I &s;hall endeavour to evince by the following rea&s;ons, which appear to me &s;trongly conclu&s;ive, e&s;pe|cially if con&s;idered in one conjunct view.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, I would offer, may be &s;et in the following light. We &s;ee, in fact, that the various &s;pecies of creatures, living on our earth, are &s;o con&s;tituted, as that the exi&s;tence of one of them is no hindrance to the exi&s;tence of ano|ther; but they are all well enough capable of exi&s;ting together, as the extent of the world gives a &s;ufficiency of room for it. The exi&s;t|ence of man, the top-creature in this &s;y&s;tem, is no bar to the exi&s;tence of any other cla&s;s of creatures, in the de&s;cending &s;cale, quite down to the lowe&s;t perceiving animal: But there is as real a &s;ufficiency of &s;pace for their exi&s;tence, as if <HI>he</HI> had not been made; and as like a &s;uf|ficiency for him, as if <HI>they</HI> had not been in be|ing. And the &s;ame may be &s;aid, with equal truth, of all the other orders of beings, with re&s;pect to the exi&s;tence of one another, in this part of the creation.&mdash;And &s;hould we extend our thoughts to other worlds, and the various cla&s;&s;es of beings in them, there is the &s;ame rea|&s;on &s;till to think, that the exi&s;tence of one of
<PB N="191" REF="018397_0189_0FA70C82E12E04C0">
them does not interfere with the exi&s;tence of another. <HI>Angels,</HI> and any &s;uperior order of be|ings, may as ea&s;ily be made capable of exi&s;ting, at the &s;ame time, as if one only of the&s;e orders had been created. And as to all the other cla&s;&s;es of beings, in all worlds, they are doubtle&s;s &s;o made, as to be all of them capable of exi&s;ting, as truly as if only one cla&s;s of them had been brought into exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Upon the truth now of the&s;e premi&s;es, it plainly follows, that the capacity for happine&s;s, in the univer&s;e, is enlarged by means of the di|ver&s;ity of beings that have exi&s;tence in it. And if the capacity is enlarged, it is, from hence, demon&s;trably certain, that the <HI>quantum</HI> of good <HI>may</HI> be <HI>greater</HI> than it could have been, if, in&s;tead of this <HI>diver&s;ity,</HI> fewer orders of beings, or a &s;ingle one only, had been made.</P>
<P>It is, indeed, from this diver&s;ity of beings, duly &s;ubordinated to each other, that the <HI>pleni|tude</HI> of nature ari&s;es. A few orders of beings only would not have &s;erved to this purpo&s;e. The creation is <HI>filled up,</HI> by that admirably nice and curious variety in the cla&s;&s;es of creatures, whereby they are fitted to be proper links in the chain of exi&s;tence; all concurring, as &s;o many well adju&s;ted parts, to con&s;titute <HI>one whole</HI> without <HI>void</HI> or <HI>cha&s;m.</HI> Thus we are naturally led to think, from what falls within the reach of our ob&s;ervation, in this &s;y&s;tem to which we belong. For, it is evident, that, if the order of men only had been created, the
<PB N="192" REF="018397_0190_0FA70C851FE8F9D0">
<HI>room,</HI> that is now filled with the inferior ranks of creatures, would have been a <HI>va&s;t cha&s;m. Men</HI> would have multiplied no fa&s;ter than they do, if there were no <HI>brutes</HI>: Nor would they have been better accommodated. One of the <HI>brutal</HI> &s;pecies does not hinder the exi&s;tence, or increa&s;e, or &s;upport, of another; but there is both room and &s;uitable provi&s;ion for them all. And &s;hould any other cla&s;&s;es of the creatures be pitched upon, they are &s;o con&s;tituted as that there would be room &s;till for all the other or|ders. And the &s;ame rea&s;oning will hold good if extended to all other &s;y&s;tems. There are vari|ous ranks of creatures in them: And, perhaps, otherwi&s;e, they would not have been &s;o full of <HI>being</HI> as they might have been.</P>
<P>The truth is, This world of our's is &s;o con|trived, as that we can no where di&s;cern in it any <HI>void.</HI> It appears, on the contrary, by means of the various ranks of creatures, gradually ri&s;ing in perfection to <HI>men,</HI> the highe&s;t order of them, to be perfectly filled with being. And, if there is no <HI>cha&s;m</HI> in this &s;y&s;tem, of which we are a main part, why &s;hould we &s;uppo&s;e <HI>one,</HI> in the other &s;y&s;tems con&s;tituting the univer&s;e? It is far more rea&s;onable, from the analogy of nature, to think, that the gradation &s;till goes on ri&s;ing, in other worlds, beyond the bounds of our mo&s;t enlarged imagination.</P>
<P>And what though, in this va&s;t diver&s;ity, there &s;hould be orders of beings formed for happine&s;s (at lea&s;t in the fir&s;t &s;tages of their po&s;&s;ible ex|i&s;tence)
<PB N="193" REF="018397_0191_0FA70C85961A3FB8">
in an imperfect, low degree only? Is it not &s;ufficient to an&s;wer, that <HI>no capacity</HI> for happine&s;s, however &s;mall, &s;hould be excluded the creation, &s;o long as it is not an hindrance to the exi&s;tence of other gradually ri&s;ing capa|cities, till we have exceeded all conception: E&s;pecially, if it be added, that the leaving out any <HI>capacity</HI> for happine&s;s, however diminutive, in this chain of beings, will proportionably &s;ub&s;tract from the <HI>&s;um total</HI> of general happi|ne&s;s; which, in this ca&s;e, would not be &s;o great as it might have been.</P>
<P>The &s;hort of the ca&s;e is, the creation of God, by means of this diver&s;ity of beings, gradually and regularly ri&s;ing in perfection, even to the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree, becomes a <HI>mo&s;t perfect and contiguous whole</HI>; demon&s;trating the riches and glory of the Creator's goodne&s;s, far beyond what it could have done, if the <HI>continuity</HI> had been broken, by the <HI>non-exi&s;tence</HI> of any of the ranks of creatures, which now make it an <HI>ab|&s;olutely full and well-connected univer&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>It may add both light and force to the pre&s;ent argument, if I ju&s;t &s;ubjoin, That the various ranks of creatures are &s;o far from being an ob|&s;truction to the exi&s;tence of one another, that their exi&s;tence in this multiform be|&s;towment of it, is a <HI>greater ble&s;&s;ing</HI> than it would have been, if they had exi&s;ted <HI>&s;ingly</HI> and <HI>alone.</HI> This is certainly the truth, in fact, with re&s;pect to the order of man. The exi&s;tence of the other cla&s;&s;es of beings below him is &s;o far from being a di&s;&s;ervice to him, that, if they had not
<PB N="194" REF="018397_0192_0FA70C866601C068">
been created, he mu&s;t have enjoyed exi&s;tence without many of the advantages, tending to the comfort of it, which he now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. And this is mo&s;t probably the truth, with re&s;pect to all the other &s;pecies of creatures. They are placed in &s;uch a degree of &s;ubordination, as to be fitted to be u&s;eful to one another: In|&s;omuch that every cla&s;s of beings, by rea&s;on of this &s;ub&s;ervient diver&s;ity, enjoys exi&s;tence un|der more de&s;irable circum&s;tances than it could otherwi&s;e have done. And this may be the real truth of the ca&s;e, throughout the whole compa&s;s of <HI>percipient</HI> exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Another con&s;ideration, not improper to be mentioned, in proof of the point we are upon, is, its being plainly <HI>impo&s;&s;ible,</HI> that any <HI>&s;ingle</HI> or|der of beings could be formed capable of <HI>all the good,</HI> which <HI>many</HI> orders, variou&s;ly endowed with faculties, may be fitted for the enjoyment of. It is indi&s;putable, that every being, of whatever rank, whether high or low, mu&s;t have its own proper nature. This, we at once perceive to be nece&s;&s;ary, in regard of beings that have ma|terial bodies. They are indeed ranked into different cla&s;&s;es, on account of their different bodily make. And a difference in bodily &s;truc|ture can no more exi&s;t in the &s;ame bodies, at once, than they can occupy different pla|ces, at the &s;ame time. And, as different or|ganizations of parts, in <HI>perceiving</HI> beings that have bodies, are intended, among other u&s;es, to form <HI>different capacities,</HI> in <HI>kind</HI> &s;ometimes,
<PB N="195" REF="018397_0193_0FA70C8A6676C958">
as well as <HI>degree</HI>; it is plain, that beings thus differently organized can no more be capable of <HI>ju&s;t the &s;ame good,</HI> than they can partake of the &s;ame bodily &s;tructure. And the &s;ame is as true of <HI>incorporeal</HI> beings. They mu&s;t, in all their different cla&s;&s;es, have different <HI>men|tal</HI> powers: Otherwi&s;e, they could not be rank|ed into different orders. And there is no rea|&s;on to think, but that different <HI>mental</HI> powers, as well as bodily ones, &s;hould form different <HI>capacities for happine&s;s,</HI> and <HI>&s;uch,</HI> many times, as cannot exi&s;t in the &s;ame minds, at the &s;ame time: The con&s;equence from all which is obviou&s;ly this;&mdash;That &s;hould the mo&s;t perfect order of beings be created that <HI>could</HI> be, it mu&s;t be an order of &s;ome certain nature and con&s;titution, which nature could not be capable of all the different powers of innumerably various natures, &s;ome of which, at lea&s;t, are ab&s;olutely incom|patible with each other. And if no &s;ingle or|der of beings could be endowed with the various faculties of all natures, it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be the &s;ubjects of all the various degrees and kinds of happine&s;s, which the&s;e <HI>natures</HI> may be &s;everally fitted for, and capable of.</P>
<P>Perhaps, it will be objected here, though no &s;ingle order of beings could be capable of <HI>ju&s;t the &s;ame happine&s;s,</HI> which various orders might be capable of; yet one order po&s;&s;ibly might be &s;o formed as to be qualified for <HI>greater</HI> hap|pine&s;s of <HI>another</HI> and <HI>more perfect kind.</HI></P>

And it is certain, if all the happine&s;s of all the &s;ubordinate ranks of beings be added to the happine&s;s of this highe&s;t order, the <HI>&s;um-total</HI> will be greater, than if the happi|ne&s;s of this highe&s;t order only is taken into the account.

<P>Another argument &s;till, to the purpo&s;e we are upon, is this; that the infinitely benevolent Being ought always to be &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t him|&s;elf in producing good, with <HI>intelligence,</HI> wi&s;e <HI>de&s;ign,</HI> and according to &s;ome method di&s;cover|ing exqui&s;ite &s;kill and contrivance.

In order to this, there mu&s;t be facul|ties previou&s;ly created and contrived for the perception of this good; and more than this, it mu&s;t be the effect of the exerci&s;e of the&s;e

faculties upon their proper objects, according to &s;ome well-e&s;tabli&s;hed con&s;titution. And in a diver&s;ified creation, one filled with different ranks of beings, all variou&s;ly endowed with ca|pacities fitted to make them happy, according to &s;tated laws, in a certain degree; I &s;ay, in &s;uch a creation as this, there <HI>may</HI> be manife&s;|tation of more art and contrivance in di&s;pen&s;ing good, than in a creation in which one order only of beings &s;hould have exi&s;tence, though the &s;kill herein di&s;played &s;hould be as <HI>great</HI> as it <HI>could</HI> be. For it is indeed impo&s;&s;ible, that <HI>all</HI> the methods of wi&s;e contrivance &s;hould be di&s;covered in the make of any &s;ingle order of beings whatever. And of this we have as good proof as we can de&s;ire; becau&s;e it is evident from what we &s;ee, in fact, that &s;ome of <HI>the&s;e methods</HI> are of &s;uch a nature as to be incompatible with any one cla&s;s of beings that can po&s;&s;ibly be made. It is a contradiction that any order of beings &s;hould have a mental &s;tructure <HI>only,</HI> and yet, at the &s;ame time, po&s;&s;e&s;s bodies with vari|ous organs admirably contrived for the convey|ance of &s;en&s;ations of &s;uch a kind. And unle&s;s the &s;ame beings could have bodies, and not have them, at the &s;ame time, it is impo&s;&s;ible that the <HI>whole</HI> of that contrivance, which is actually di&s;covered in the creation, could be manife&s;t|ed in the make and circum&s;tances of any one order of beings that could be created. So that, had the goodne&s;s of the Deity been di&s;played towards one rank of beings only, however per|fect,

of is &s;o e&s;&s;entially connected with a diver&s;ified con&s;titution of beings and things, as that they could not po&s;&s;e&s;s it but upon this plan. It is certain, in point of fact, that the <HI>intelligent moral</HI> beings, in our &s;y&s;tem, do, from this di|ver&s;ity, receive, according to e&s;tabli&s;hed laws, tho&s;e numberle&s;s ideas, which are the &s;ource of all tho&s;e acquirements in knowledge, which give them their whole <HI>intellectual</HI> plea&s;ure.

<P>And now, in a <HI>diver&s;ified</HI> con&s;titution, there is room for the conveyance of all po&s;&s;ible ideas into all various minds, not by meer impre&s;&s;i|on, but in certain ways, and according to &s;tat|ed

<P>There is certainly one &s;ort of happine&s;s, which I e&s;teem a con&s;ideration &s;ufficient of it&s;elf to bear the whole weight of the pre&s;ent cau&s;e: I &s;ay, there is one &s;ort of happine&s;s (perhaps the noble&s;t, and mo&s;t God-like) which could not have place in the creation, but upon &s;uppo&s;iti|on of its being, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, a <HI>diver&s;ified</HI> one.

by all beings, it is evident, that <HI>good</HI> can|not po&s;&s;ibly be communicated from one to ano|ther.

<P N="2">II. I now proceed to the <HI>&s;econd</HI> objection, taken from tho&s;e <HI>moral</HI> di&s;orders, which, it is pleaded, could not have exi&s;tence in the crea|tion, if it was produced and governed by an infinitely <HI>holy</HI> and <HI>benevolent</HI> being. Such a

Maker and Ruler of the univer&s;e, it is &s;aid, mu&s;t have taken effectual care for the preven|tion of <HI>moral</HI> evil, and the unhappine&s;s ari&s;ing therefrom. It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that a be|ing infinitely aver&s;e from <HI>moral</HI> impurity would have &s;uffered the works of his hands to be de|filed with it. It cannot be imagined, that an infinitely <HI>benevolent</HI> Being would have left crea|tures of his own forming to &s;uch <HI>immoral</HI> conduct as would reflect di&s;honor on his goodne&s;s, by bringing unhappine&s;s and mi&s;ery into a world of his contriving and making? It is not po&s;&s;i|ble that &s;uch a being as the Deity is repre&s;ented to be, &s;hould place his creatures in circum|&s;tances, wherein they might pervert their pow|ers, and involve them&s;elves in ruin.

They are not worthy of an infinitely holy and good <HI>God</HI>: E&s;pecially, if it be con&s;idered, that the exi&s;tence of <HI>moral</HI> evil cannot be conceived of without <HI>permi&s;&s;ion,</HI> at lea&s;t, from the Deity: Nay, it cannot be &s;up|po&s;ed, but that he mu&s;t have <HI>fore&s;een,</HI> not only the <HI>po&s;&s;ibility,</HI> but the <HI>high probability,</HI> of its taking place in the world; and yet he &s;uffered it to do &s;o: Yea, &s;o far was he from prevent|ing it, that it &s;eems as though &s;ome of the mo&s;t important mea&s;ures of his conduct were formed, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of its <HI>actual being</HI> in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>This is the objection urged at large, and, I think, in its full force, again&s;t the creation and government of an infinitely holy and benevo|lent
<PB N="205" REF="018397_0203_0FA70BA604EFD6F8">
Being. And it is far from being a trifling one. Had it &s;o been, &s;uch numbers of philo|&s;ophers and divines, in all parts of the world, would not have employed &s;o much of their time and pains in order to remove it. And it is, perhaps, a difficulty that cannot be perfectly re|moved, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of human faculties. But this is no proof that it cannot be done. It ought to be remembered, that we men are but a low order of intelligent creatures; and what wonder is it, if that &s;hould be a difficulty, and an in&s;uperable one, to us, which may be none at all to a &s;uperior order of beings. It is a cer|tain fact that moral evil exi&s;ts in our world; and it is as certain a truth, that God is infi|nitely benevolent. And &s;hould we find our|&s;elves unable to point out &s;o clearly and fully, as we might de&s;ire, the con&s;i&s;tency between this fact, and this truth, we may, notwith&s;tand|ing, keeping within the reach of our faculties, go &s;o far as to &s;ay, and upon rational grounds, that which may be &s;ufficient, if not to &s;ilence all objection, yet to &s;atisfy our&s;elves, that mo|ral evil may exi&s;t, and the Deity at the &s;ame time be infinitely benevolent.

But it is not fair, in ma|king an e&s;timate of the corrupt &s;tate of the world, to enumerate all the horrid immoralities which have been perpetrated, at the &s;ame time overlooking the many &s;hining virtues which have adorned the character of multitudes.

<P>If the <HI>Deity</HI> could have prevented the abu&s;e of <HI>moral</HI> liberty, it mu&s;t have been in one of the&s;e three ways, either by not giving <HI>free agents</HI> a place in the &s;cale of beings; or by making them &s;o perfect as to be incapable of any wrong conduct; or by interpo&s;ing, at all times, as occa&s;ion might require, to hinder the <HI>mi&s;u&s;e</HI> of <HI>moral</HI> powers, in beings that po&s;&s;e&s;s them, either in a higher or lower degree. The&s;e are the only conceivable ways, in which the <HI>Deity</HI> can be &s;uppo&s;ed to have it in his power to prevent <HI>moral</HI> di&s;order in the creation. And will any &s;ay, that he <HI>mu&s;t,</HI> if infinitely benevolent, in one or other of the&s;e ways, have certainly prevented it? So far is this from being capable of proof, that there is good rea&s;on, on the contrary, to think, it was <HI>naturally,</HI> or <HI>morally</HI> impo&s;&s;ible, that he &s;hould, in either of them, have done it.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>fir&s;t</HI>;&mdash;The not giving <HI>free agents</HI> a place in the &s;cale of beings would have been a gro&s;s reflection upon the <HI>benevolence</HI> of the <HI>Deity,</HI> in&s;tead of making way for its bright|er di&s;play. For the <HI>quantum</HI> of good, capable of being communicated, would, upon this &s;up|po&s;ition, have been greatly le&s;&s;ened, and indeed reduced to a very pitt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nce, comparatively &s;peak|ing: And the good enjoyed would have been of the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t imperfect kind too. For there is no <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> like that which is <HI>intel|lectual</HI>
<PB N="210" REF="018397_0208_0FA70BAFE1CCFC10">
and <HI>moral</HI>; none &s;o noble and divine in its nature, none &s;o &s;atisfying to the &s;ubjects of it. Be&s;ides, if there were no <HI>moral agents</HI> exi&s;ting, there could be no way for the <HI>Deity</HI> to manife&s;t his <HI>moral</HI> glory, which is his great|e&s;t. He might, it is true, by creating and go|verning an <HI>unintelligent</HI> world, or creatures in it endowed with <HI>intelligence</HI> in &s;o low a degree as to be incapable of <HI>moral</HI> conduct, di&s;play, in a mea&s;ure, both power, and contrivance, as well as goodne&s;s; but he could make no ma|nife&s;tation of holine&s;s or ju&s;tice, or tho&s;e mo|difications even of goodne&s;s, mercy, forbear|ance, long-&s;uffering, forgivene&s;s. If there was no <HI>free agency,</HI> there could be no virtue, nor any of that &s;ublime happine&s;s, which may be the re&s;ult of it. There could not, in one word, be any &s;uch thing as <HI>moral government,</HI> with|out which the riche&s;t di&s;plays of the mo&s;t ami|able perfection could have no place in the creation. And would it now have been for the honor of the <HI>Deity</HI> to have withheld the ble&s;|&s;ing of <HI>moral</HI> liberty, by not giving exi&s;tence to <HI>free agents?</HI> Can it be thought <HI>fit,</HI> that &s;uch an <HI>intelligent moral</HI> agent, as <HI>God</HI> is, &s;hould create beings, but with &s;uch con&s;tituted pow|ers, as that in the whole circle of exi&s;tence, there &s;hould be no living images of him&s;elf, no creatures made capable of that <HI>intelligent moral</HI> conduct, or of that <HI>rational</HI> moral happine&s;s, which compleat his character as a mo&s;t glori|ous and ble&s;&s;ed Being? Is it rea&s;onable that
<PB N="211" REF="018397_0209_0FA70BB0820A1C28">
the high privilege of <HI>moral intelligence</HI> &s;hould be excluded the creation? That no being &s;hould be made capable of <HI>virtue,</HI> and that true&s;t kind of happine&s;s which is the re&s;ult of it? Will any &s;ay, it is better there &s;hould be no <HI>free agency,</HI> than that beings &s;hould be liable to abu&s;e it? This cannot ju&s;tly be pleaded; for if <HI>free agents</HI> are liable to abu&s;e their liberty, they are al&s;o capable of making a good u&s;e of it, to their con&s;equent, un&s;peakable happine&s;s. And can it be thought right, that &s;o glorious a ca|pacity for happine&s;s as <HI>free agency,</HI> &s;hould be totally withheld from all beings, becau&s;e it might po&s;&s;ibly have been perverted in its ten|dency? What though &s;ome &s;hould abu&s;e it, might not others make a wi&s;e improvement of it? And why &s;hould this be prevented? Why put out of their power, by the <HI>non-be&s;towment</HI> of <HI>freedom of choice?</HI></P>
<P>It is true, if the gift of <HI>liberty</HI> was likely, upon the whole, to produce more <HI>moral</HI> evil than good, it would be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on why it &s;hould be withheld. But there is no &s;olid ground on which to build &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition. It may be ju&s;tly que&s;tioned, whether this is the ca&s;e, even in this world of our's, where moral freedom is enjoyed but in a low and im|perfect degree: Much le&s;s may it be thought to be &s;o, in other words, among &s;uperior orders of <HI>intelligent moral</HI> beings. Perhaps, taking in|to con&s;ideration all the ranks of this kind of beings, in all parts of the creation, but a <HI>few,</HI>
<PB N="212" REF="018397_0210_0FA70BB141005900">
comparatively, have mi&s;u&s;ed their <HI>moral freedom.</HI> To be &s;ure, it is not known to be otherwi&s;e&punc; and therefore, for all the proof that can be given to the contrary, the effect of moral and intel|lectual endowment <HI>may</HI> have been the happine&s;s of the creation, inconceivably beyond what it could have been, if the&s;e endowments had not been be&s;towed. And &s;hould this be the truth of fact, as it may be, can it be thought fit, that &s;o much happine&s;s &s;hould never have been, by not giving exi&s;tence to <HI>free agents</HI> at all, be|cau&s;e &s;ome have fooli&s;hly mi&s;improved their moral liberty to their own di&s;advantage? It cannot, with any rea&s;on, be pretended.</P>
<P>But, it will be &s;aid, could not the <HI>Deity</HI> have made <HI>all</HI> free agents <HI>&s;o perfect</HI> as to be <HI>incapa|ble of wrong conduct?</HI> This is the <HI>&s;econd</HI> way, in which it is imagined, that he might have pre|vented <HI>moral evil,</HI> and would have done it, if he had been infinitely benevolent. To which it may be replyed as follows.</P>
<P>That, if <HI>all</HI> free agents had been made with &s;uch <HI>perfect</HI> moral powers, as is here &s;uppo&s;ed, it mu&s;t have been an unavoidable bar to that <HI>diver&s;ity</HI> in the creation, which, as has been already proved, is &s;o far from le&s;&s;ening the quan|tity of communicable good, that it really makes way for a richer and fuller communication of it, upon the whole, than would otherwi&s;e have been po&s;&s;ible. And, was there no other rea|&s;on, this mu&s;t have been effectual to re&s;train the infinitely benevolent <HI>Deity,</HI> from making
<PB N="213" REF="018397_0211_0FA70BB1FB31F9F8">
all beings &s;o nearly equal in their rational and moral powers.</P>
<P>But, letting this pa&s;s for nothing, it may be ju&s;tly que&s;tioned, whether the creation of intel|ligent beings <HI>&s;o perfect</HI> as to be <HI>incapable of mi&s;|conduct,</HI> is not an <HI>impo&s;&s;ibility</HI> in the nature of things. For, &s;hould we &s;uppo&s;e creatures as perfect as they can be, they would yet be <HI>finite</HI>: And how <HI>intelligent moral</HI> beings that are <HI>finite</HI> &s;hould be wholly incapable of becoming faulty, in any kind, or degree, is beyond all conception. It is certainly more rea&s;onable to think, that the infinitely perfect Being is the <HI>only one</HI> that can be <HI>ab&s;olutely impeccable.</HI> For he only can &s;ee, at once, all the po&s;&s;ible connecti|ons of ideas, and unerringly know what is right and fit in all ca&s;es whatever: And he only is immutably and everla&s;tingly di&s;po&s;ed to chu&s;e and act according to the truth and rea&s;on of things.</P>
<P>But, &s;hould it be &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>naturally</HI> po&s;|&s;ible for <HI>free agents</HI> to be <HI>at once</HI> created &s;o per|fect as that it could not be that they &s;hould err in <HI>choice</HI> or <HI>behaviour,</HI> it will &s;till remain a que&s;tion, whether it be <HI>morally</HI> po&s;&s;ible, i. e. po&s;&s;ible in con&s;i&s;tency with wi&s;e and fit conduct in the Deity? And, perhaps, thus <HI>morally</HI> &s;peak|ing, it is not po&s;&s;ible. This, it is probable, may &s;eem a paradox to &s;ome; but there are rea&s;ons for its &s;upport, which are ju&s;tly con|clu&s;ive; though they &s;hould not amount to &s;trict demon&s;tration.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="018397_0212_0FA70BB30A4A00B0">So far as our knowledge extends, it is cer|tain, in point of fact, that <HI>intelligent moral</HI> be|ings are not when they <HI>fir&s;t</HI> come into exi&s;tence, either &s;o <HI>perfect</HI> or <HI>happy</HI> as they may be, and indeed cannot but be, if the tendency of their faculties is not ob&s;tructed. They are &s;o formed, &s;ome of them at lea&s;t, as to be capable of pro|gre&s;s, both in perfection and happine&s;s, to a very high degree: Which progre&s;s is very much dependant on them&s;elves, the u&s;e they make of their implanted powers, and the pains they are at to cultivate and improve them. Thus it is with <HI>man,</HI> the highe&s;t intelligent moral agent we are particularly acquainted with. His facul|ties, at fir&s;t, are feeble, and not to be exerci&s;ed but in a low degree: Yet they are &s;o made as to be gradually capable of enlargement, even beyond what could have been imagined, if it had not been for experience. And this enlarge|ment is, in a great mea&s;ure, though not wholly, dependent on him&s;elf: in&s;omuch, that he will be m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re or le&s;s perfect and happy, both as an <HI>intelligent</HI> and <HI>moral</HI> being, in proportion to the u&s;e he makes of his faculties. Neither the per|fecti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r happine&s;s, he is capable of, is com|municated to him <HI>independent</HI> of his own <HI>choice</HI> and <HI>conduct,</HI> but in <HI>connection</HI> therewith, or in con&s;equence thereof, and as a reward therefor. If he makes a wi&s;e and good improvement of the powers he is endowed with, he will reap the advantage of his pains in corre&s;ponding attain|ments in perfection and happine&s;s: Whereas, if
<PB N="215" REF="018397_0213_0FA70BB37A33DF30">
he takes no care to cultivate his faculties, the effect will be, their remaining in a low, imper|fect &s;tate: Nay, &s;uch is the con&s;titution of his nature, as we may &s;ee afterwards, that, by mi&s;|improving them, he may not only check their growth, but bring them into a declining con|dition, &s;o as that they may become gradually unfit to yield him any fruit but that of unhappi|ne&s;s and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>This is the truth of fact, re&s;pecting the high|e&s;t, if not the <HI>only,</HI> order of <HI>intelligent moral</HI> be|ings, in this world. And the fact, &s;o far as we are able to judge, is perfectly agreeable to what is <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>fit</HI> in the rea&s;on of things. As the beings, we are &s;peaking of, are made capable of happine&s;s, in con&s;equence of their own <HI>choice</HI> and <HI>conduct,</HI> and in proportion to the <HI>re|gularity</HI> therein di&s;covered, what more ju&s;t than its dependence thereon? In what more proper way could <HI>wi&s;e,</HI> though infinite, benevolence communicate happine&s;s to them? What un|&s;uitablene&s;s is there in making happine&s;s their own acqui&s;ition, the fruit of their own indu&s;try? What rea&s;onable beings would not chu&s;e exi&s;t|ence upon the&s;e terms? And who will &s;ay, that they would make an unwi&s;e choice? It is certain, this method of communicating hap|pine&s;s <HI>may</HI> be the <HI>wi&s;e&s;t</HI> and <HI>be&s;t</HI>; and that glorious intelligent Being, who perfectly &s;ees the fitne&s;s of things, in all po&s;&s;ible connecti|on, <HI>may</HI> know it to be &s;o: And &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uld this be the ca&s;e, as cannot be di&s;proved, it was not
<PB N="216" REF="018397_0214_0FA70BB7D1B3E410">
po&s;&s;ible for him, acting <HI>morally,</HI> or, in other words, as an <HI>intelligent wi&s;e</HI> agent, to have com|municated it any other way.</P>
<P>And this rea&s;oning, if extended to the other ranks of free agents, in other worlds, will equal|ly hold good. It is <HI>fit</HI> and <HI>right,</HI> in true rea|&s;on, that they al&s;o &s;hould be &s;o con&s;tituted, as that their perfection and happine&s;s &s;hould not be communicated with their beings, but made to depend, in &s;ome &s;uitable mea&s;ure, on the wi&s;e and regular exerci&s;e of their powers: The con&s;equence of which mu&s;t be their <HI>liablene&s;s,</HI> in common with mankind, though in various degrees, according to their various capacities and circum&s;tances, to a <HI>voluntary perver&s;ion</HI> of their faculties. This, I &s;ay, appears to an at|tentive mind the <HI>fitte&s;t</HI> method of communi|cating <HI>good</HI> to <HI>rea&s;onable moral</HI> beings: And the Deity perceiving it to be &s;o, may have all along ob&s;erved this rule, in the be&s;towment of it. Nor is there a <HI>known fact</HI> to the contrary, in the whole creation: Though, if we may give credit to the writings called &s;acred, there is a <HI>fact,</HI> relating to &s;ome of the <HI>intelligent</HI> be|ings, in other worlds, which perfectly coincides with this method of di&s;pen&s;ing happine&s;s. For we there read of the 'angels which &s;inned,' and of the 'angels which kept not their fir&s;t e&s;tate; which account of the&s;e <HI>moral intelligences</HI> does not con&s;i&s;t with their being created happy, in|dependent of their own virtuous conduct, but &s;uppo&s;es the contrary: Obviou&s;ly leading to the
<PB N="217" REF="018397_0215_0FA70BBA405AF140">
thought, that they were made, as <HI>men</HI> are, capable of happine&s;s, but yet liable to a <HI>voluntary &s;elf-cor|ruption.</HI> And all the ranks of <HI>moral</HI> beings <HI>might</HI> be created in like circum&s;tances: And, I will add, <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have been &s;o created, if this was <HI>mo&s;t wi&s;e,</HI> and <HI>fit,</HI> as we have &s;een there is rea&s;on to think it was, and no proof can be given to the contrary.</P>
<P>Not but that there are <HI>free agents,</HI> who may, before this time, have got beyond any <HI>probable danger</HI> of <HI>moral</HI> defection. And this may be the ca&s;e, even of <HI>men,</HI> in &s;ome other &s;tate; though &s;o inferior an order of <HI>intelligent</HI> beings. But then, this freedom from danger ought to be con&s;idered, as owing, not to the perfection of their faculties, as, at fir&s;t, communicated to them; but partly to the <HI>&s;trong, habitual</HI> turn that has been given them, by wi&s;e and regular exerci&s;e; and partly, though principally, to the <HI>&s;uperintending influence</HI> of the <HI>Deity,</HI> who may think it <HI>fit</HI> and <HI>wi&s;e,</HI> after &s;uitable <HI>trial</HI> and <HI>im|provement,</HI> to pre&s;erve them from all faulty con|duct, &s;o far, at lea&s;t, as that they &s;hall never fall from the perfection and happine&s;s of their pre&s;ent &s;tate.</P>
<P>But, before <HI>intelligent moral</HI> beings have gone through &s;ome &s;tate of trial, wherein they have made the happine&s;s proper to their natures, their <HI>own choice,</HI> and have &s;o conducted them&s;elves as to be worthy of it, and to have fitted them|&s;elves, by a cour&s;e of &s;uitable exerci&s;e, for the enjoyment of it: I &s;ay, before this, it does not &s;eem <HI>meet</HI> and <HI>fit,</HI> that it &s;hould be con|ferred

This, to be &s;ure, as has been ob&s;er|ved, <HI>may be</HI> the <HI>fitte&s;t</HI> way of communicating happine&s;s to <HI>all</HI> moral beings, without di&s;tincti|on; and <HI>might</HI> appear to be &s;o to the infinite and &s;upreme Mind: And, if this was the real truth, as we cannot &s;ay it was not, it could not be within the <HI>moral</HI> power of the <HI>Deity,</HI> to have created <HI>free agents,</HI> and put them <HI>at once,</HI> without previous <HI>trial</HI> or <HI>improvement,</HI> in a &s;tate of <HI>full perfection,</HI> and <HI>confirmed happine&s;s.</HI> And if &s;o, they could not have been made <HI>impecca|ble,</HI> as it is pleaded they might have been, and mu&s;t have been, if their Maker had been an <HI>infinitely benevolent</HI> Being.</P>
<P>There is yet another way, in which it is thought the <HI>Deity</HI> might have <HI>prevented</HI> moral evil; and this is, by interpo&s;ing, at all times,

<PB N="222" REF="018397_0220_0FA70BBEB8BCEAE8">
that there &s;hould be a &s;imilar gradation from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t order of them: The con&s;equence from which is, that the capacities of the&s;e moral beings mu&s;t be various, and their attainment to a confirmed, virtuous temper pro|portionably more or le&s;s difficult. The cla&s;s of men, I &s;uppo&s;e, may ju&s;tly be reckoned the lowe&s;t of the moral kind; for which rea&s;on, their conducting in life &s;o as to de&s;erve the character of virtuous may be mo&s;t difficult.

Would this have been a better con&s;titution, than the pre&s;ent? What wi&s;e and con&s;iderate per&s;on can think it?" The plain truth is, there is no appetite, affection, or pa&s;&s;i|on, as planted in our nature by the God who made us, but what was intended, and wi&s;ely adapted, to an&s;wer &s;ome valuable purpo&s;e or other; in&s;omuch, that it would have been greatly di&s;advantageous to us, had we not been

And &s;hould they, by not being kept under due government, prove the occa&s;ion of &s;in, and con&s;equent mi&s;ery, could the Creator, in con&s;i&s;tency with rea&s;on, be charg|ed with not having been benevolent? E&s;pe|cially, if it be con&s;idered, that the&s;e very appe|tites and pa&s;&s;ions, might have been a means, wi&s;ely improved, of promoting that virtue in us, which would yield the full happine&s;s proper to &s;uch beings as we are.</P>
<P>Some will &s;till plead, if appetites and pa&s;&s;i|ons, in &s;uch a con&s;titution as our's, &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed to be proper, why need they have been heightened to &s;uch a degree of &s;trength? Or if even this &s;hould have been expedient, why were not our intellectual and moral powers proportionably exalted, that the undue influ|ence of appetite and pa&s;&s;ion might the more ea&s;ily be controuled? Would it not have been more kind in our Creator, and have argued greater benevolence, if he had given us &s;tronger rational abilities, and weaker animal propen&s;i|ties? E&s;pecially, as it is principally owing to the &s;trong impetus of our bodily inclinations, that we are &s;o generally, led a&s;ide into the path of vice and folly, to our own great di&s;advan|tage. The an&s;wer I would return to this ob|ection, which, far from being a trifling one, de&s;erves a &s;erious con&s;ideration, is as follows.</P>
<P>If our appetites and pa&s;&s;ions, in their na|tural &s;tate, and as implanted in us by our Crea|tor, had been lowered in their &s;trength, they
<PB N="227" REF="018397_0225_0FA70BC6B953FEB0">
might have been in&s;ufficient to an&s;wer the good ends of their original implantation. In like manner, had our intellectual powers been height|ened, they might have unfitted us to live in &s;uch a world as this is. The contrivance of the Deity in man's con&s;titution, and the adju&s;t|ment of its various parts, both animal and mental, is perfect, and will admit, other things remaining as they were, of no amendment. One power is &s;o clo&s;ely connected with, and near|ly related to another, and that other to another &s;till, and the whole to &s;uch a world as we are placed in, that no alteration could be made in one part, but what would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffect another, and that other &s;till a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and &s;o on, till there mu&s;t be a total alteration, not only in man, but the world he lives in; the ab&s;urdity of which will be explained, and the pertinency of this whole paragraph ju&s;tified, in its proper place hereafter.</P>
<P>It may al&s;o be worthy of notice, that a varie|ty in the trial of various cla&s;&s;es of intelligent moral beings, in point of difficulty and hazard, may be a wi&s;e contrivance of the Creator for the more illu&s;trious di&s;play of his goodne&s;s, in harmony with his other moral attributes. It is certain, with re&s;pect to us men, that our trial, as individuals, is, for wi&s;e and good ends, ad|mirably various in point of difficulty and dan|ger; and why might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t not, for like good ends, be a more difficult one, &s;hould we be con&s;i|dered as a cla&s;s, of beings, than has been allotted

to other cla&s;&s;es of a &s;uperior order? There is an analogy in this with the whole conduct of God, which has been various, both in making and governing all the creatures he has given exi&s;tence to. And, it may be, his benevolence, by means of this variety, is more wi&s;ely, and fully di&s;played, than it would have been by any other. And one cla&s;s of beings would have no more rea&s;on to complain, &s;hould the difficulty of their trial, in con&s;equence of this expedient variety, be greater, and attended with more hazard, than the trial of another cla&s;s; I &s;ay, they would have no more rea&s;on for com|plaint, than they have becau&s;e they were not made that other cla&s;s of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">atures.</P>
<P>It ought to be con&s;idered &s;till further, that men's appetites and pa&s;&s;ions, by being indulged beyond what is fit and right, may be heighten|ed in their impetus, and quite altered from their natural &s;tate. And when this is the ca&s;e, as we all know it too commonly is, by not keep|ing them within tho&s;e re&s;traints we both might, and ought to have done, we our&s;elves, and not our Creator, are to blame, if di&s;orders are introduced into our frame, and our trial, by this means, is made more difficult and dange|rous, than it otherwi&s;e would have been; and, in&s;tead of reflecting on the Deity for not hav|ing been &s;o benevolent, as we fondly imagine he might have been, we &s;hould condemn our|&s;elves, and throw the blame wholly of our own wickedne&s;s and folly; for to this it ought, in all rea&s;on, to be a&s;cribed.</P>

How, &s;ay they, could the <HI>Deity,</HI> if infinitely benevolent, not only per|mit creatures of his own forming to <HI>corrupt</HI> them&s;elves, but <HI>connect mi&s;ery</HI> with their &s;o doing; con&s;tituting things &s;o as to make their <HI>wrong doing</HI> an <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> of <HI>unhappine&s;s,</HI> in infinitely va|rious kinds, not only to them&s;elves, but to others al&s;o? What a wide door has hereby been opened for the entrance of <HI>mi&s;ery</HI> into the crea|tion? Who can compute the immen&s;e &s;um of pain and torment, of one &s;ort or another, this
<PB N="236" REF="018397_0234_0FA70BD38A02FD00">
con&s;titution has paved the way for? And can it be attributed to an infinitely benevolent Cau&s;e? Could &s;uch a &s;tate of things have ever been, if a good God had been at the head of it, as its &s;upreme directing Cau&s;e?</P>
<P>It is an&s;wered, in the fir&s;t place, by freely owning, that <HI>moral irregularity</HI> is unavoidably connected with unhappine&s;s; in&s;omuch, that by far the greater part of tho&s;e <HI>evils</HI> which abound in the creation are the <HI>natural</HI> or <HI>penal</HI> effect hereof: Nay, it is readily granted, that the con&s;titution of things is &s;uch, that <HI>moral in|telligent</HI> beings are capable of &s;o corrupting their implanted powers, as that mi&s;ery <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be the con&s;equence, both to <HI>them&s;elves</HI> and <HI>others</HI> al&s;o, in certain degrees, while they continue in this &s;tate of degeneracy. Nay, I deny not, but the con&s;titution of things is &s;uch, as that unhappi|ne&s;s mu&s;t be the fruit of abu&s;ed <HI>moral</HI> freedom, in another period of exi&s;tence, &s;o long, and in &s;uch proportion, as the wi&s;dom of the Supreme Creator and Governor may think requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>But then I add, in the next place, that this is &s;o far from arguing want of <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> in the <HI>Deity,</HI> that it very con&s;picuou&s;ly illu&s;trates the benevolence of his nature. It will probably &s;eem &s;trange, to tho&s;e who have not exerci&s;ed their thoughts upon this &s;ubject, to hear it &s;aid, that <HI>unhappine&s;s</HI> may be the fruit of <HI>benevolence,</HI> and an argument in pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f of it, rather than an objection again&s;t it. And yet, this is the real truth; and I doubt not but that may be &s;aid
<PB N="237" REF="018397_0235_0FA70BD645C0AFD0">
upon the matter, which will make it clearly and fully appear to be &s;o.</P>
<P>Only, let it be previou&s;ly remembered, that the <HI>po&s;&s;ibility</HI> of <HI>moral irregularity</HI> has been al|ready accounted for, and the actual being of it, in the creation, reconciled with infinite good|ne&s;s: Which being &s;uppo&s;ed, in this part of the argument, I proceed to &s;how,</P>
<P>Wherein the <HI>unhappine&s;s</HI> that is connected, in <HI>nature,</HI> or by <HI>po&s;itive infliction</HI> from the <HI>Deity,</HI> with the <HI>mi&s;u&s;e of moral powers,</HI> is &s;ub&s;ervient to the <HI>general good</HI> of the <HI>rational</HI> creation, which is hereby more effectually promoted than it would have been, if <HI>free agents</HI> might have <HI>acted wrong with impunity.</HI></P>
<P>And it is very obvious, in the fir&s;t place, that a great part of the unhappine&s;s following upon <HI>voluntary mi&s;conduct</HI> is of the medicinal kind, and &s;trongly tends to the cure of its pa|tients. The unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations occa&s;ioned by vicious practice, together with tho&s;e various other pains, which are <HI>naturally</HI> con&s;equent thereupon, what are they but &s;o many <HI>motives</HI> to repentance, and a due care to make a wi&s;er u&s;e of moral powers? What better adapted <HI>means</HI> could have been contrived to rou&s;e the faulty agents to attention, bring them to con|&s;ideration, and put them upon endeavours to prevent their own ruin? If they found no in|convenience in an irregular cour&s;e, what &s;hould &s;top their progre&s;s, having entered on it? What probable pro&s;pect would there be, in
<PB N="238" REF="018397_0236_0FA70BD72D786D38">
this ca&s;e, of their ever coming to them&s;elves, and recovering a right mind? And is it not for their <HI>good,</HI> that their vicious conduct &s;hould be attended with <HI>&s;uffering,</HI> while this <HI>&s;uffering</HI> is con|&s;idered under the notion of a <HI>means</HI> powerfully fitted, in a rea&s;onable way of operation, to check their folly, and reduce them to virtue? Does not <HI>pain,</HI> in this view of it, cea&s;e to be an <HI>evil,</HI> and become a <HI>real good</HI>? And ought not the <HI>Deity,</HI> who has thus con&s;tituted things, to be looked upon as a phy&s;ician and friend, de|&s;igning their <HI>intere&s;t,</HI> and not as an enemy, who is doing them harm? And the ca&s;e is ju&s;t the &s;ame in re&s;pect of <HI>puni&s;hments</HI> more <HI>po&s;i|tively</HI> inflicted. They are a <HI>means</HI> wi&s;ely adap|ted to promote the welfare of tho&s;e who &s;uffer them, and are &s;o intended by the all-merciful Governor of the univer&s;e, &s;o long as they are capable of <HI>amendment</HI> by any means whatever. And if, after this, they &s;hould be continued in &s;uffering circum&s;tances, even &s;uch a method of conduct would be perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with in|finite goodne&s;s, for &s;ome other rea&s;ons we may have occa&s;ion to mention afterwards.</P>
<P>It is very evident, in the next place, that the evils connected with immoral action, in the Divine government, are for the <HI>good</HI> of <HI>others,</HI> as well as the faulty agents them&s;elves. They are indeed, at lea&s;t in this lower world, with which we are be&s;t acquainted, a <HI>general</HI> di&s;cou|ragement to vicious practice, a &s;tanding, per|petual <HI>means</HI> provided by the <HI>Deity</HI> to &s;ecure the

<HI>virtue,</HI> and by con&s;equence the <HI>greate&s;t hap|pine&s;s,</HI> of the <HI>human &s;pecies,</HI> it may be, the only <HI>rational moral</HI> agents here exi&s;ting. It is highly probable, if not certain, that mankind, con&s;i|dering their various propen&s;ions, though all &s;uited to their <HI>condition,</HI> and &s;ubjected to the guidance of their <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> would not be re&s;train|ed within any tolerable bounds of decency, if it was <HI>&s;een</HI> that no di&s;advantage followed, when any of their rank perverted the order of their faculties, and pur&s;ued an irregular cour&s;e of action. The <HI>unhappine&s;s,</HI> in&s;eparably conjoined with voluntary, continued mi&s;conduct, by the known, e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of the Divine admini|&s;tration, is one of the grand re&s;traints provided for their &s;ecurity: And were this to be taken off, they would, without all doubt, notwith|&s;tanding all the remon&s;trances of <HI>rea&s;on</HI> again&s;t <HI>in|clination,</HI> be &s;oon lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of virtue, and trample upon the &s;acred obligations to the practice of it. And if it is for the <HI>good</HI> of man|kind that this &s;hould be prevented, &s;o far as may be, in all &s;uitable ways, it is equally for their good, that <HI>vice</HI> &s;hould be connected with <HI>mi&s;ery</HI>; becau&s;e a powerful, and yet well adap|ted <HI>means,</HI> to this end.

How &s;trongly mu&s;t it tend to &s;ecure their adherence to the rule of right, to behold a deviation from it, in this and the other in&s;tance, accompanied with mi&s;ery, by the Divine con&s;titution? It is rea&s;onable to think, it may be owing, in part, to <HI>this connection,</HI> that the <HI>whole moral creation</HI> is pre&s;erved, under the &s;uperintendency of the Supreme Governor, in a regular, orderly &s;tate. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, it is true, that &s;ome ranks of <HI>rational</HI> beings have probably never acted below the dignity of their character, and con&s;equently that they know not, from what have &s;een among them&s;elves, what un|happine&s;s means: But who can &s;ay, that the <HI>&s;ad effects</HI> of immoral conduct, in one &s;y&s;tem of intelligent beings, may not, in the Divine admini&s;tration, be &s;o related to others, as to be u&s;eful to them al&s;o? What is there unrea&s;onable in &s;uppo&s;ing, that the evils &s;uffered, by means of abu&s;ed fa|culties, in this world of our's, may, in ways,

&s;urpa&s;&s;ing our comprehen&s;ion, be capable of promoting, in a mea&s;ure, the good of moral beings, in other parts of the creation? It is certain, in the <HI>&s;y&s;tem of material nature,</HI> that other globes, and &s;ome of them va&s;tly di&s;tant too, are u&s;eful to this earth, as <HI>that</HI> al&s;o in return may be, in &s;ome degree, u&s;eful to them: And it is by this mutual u&s;efulne&s;s, to each other, that they become one harmonious good whole.

The <HI>mi&s;ery,</HI> which the indivi|duals of one order, of <HI>moral</HI> beings, may, by their di&s;orderly pur&s;uits, bring upon them&s;elves, may be de&s;igned, in the divine plan, and adapted, to promote the <HI>good,</HI> not only of that <HI>particular</HI> order, but of <HI>other</HI> orders likewi&s;e, by exhibiting a mo&s;t powerful <HI>motive</HI> to di&s;cou|rage the like mi&s;conduct, and &s;ecure an at|tachment to the law of rea&s;on and right.</P>
<P>But, if any &s;hould think this is carrying the matter too far, and upon conjecture only, it cannot however be denied, that the <HI>unhappi|ne&s;s</HI> accruing to &s;ome of the <HI>individuals</HI> of any

And it may, upon the whole, be a kindne&s;s to <HI>this order</HI> of beings, and an argument of the <HI>Deity's</HI> benevolence towards them, that he has thus connected <HI>vice</HI> and <HI>unhappine&s;s</HI> together. For it is one of the mo&s;t powerful re&s;traints from <HI>irregular action,</HI> and as &s;trong an induce|ment to the choice and practice of virtue.

creation,</HI> upon the whole, (as we have &s;een that it is) that <HI>&s;uch &s;ufferings</HI> &s;hould be the con&s;e|quent effect of &s;uch conduct, why &s;hould the goodne&s;s of the <HI>Deity</HI> be called in que&s;tion? It is true, the <HI>&s;ufferers</HI> in a <HI>future &s;tate,</HI> if &s;up|po&s;ed to be pa&s;t amendment, can reap no <HI>ad|vantage them&s;elves</HI> from their &s;ufferings: But then, it is to be con&s;idered, the&s;e &s;ufferings were <HI>originally</HI> intended for <HI>their good,</HI> by being pre&s;ented, in the <HI>forebodings</HI> of their own minds, as a powerful <HI>motive,</HI> not only to re|&s;train them from tho&s;e cour&s;es which would end in the&s;e &s;ufferings, but to urge them on to tho&s;e virtuous pur&s;uits which would be fol|lowed with all the happine&s;s they were made capable of.

made mi&s;erable, in con&s;equence of an e&s;tab|li&s;hed connection between <HI>vice</HI> and <HI>mi&s;ery,</HI> than that the <HI>virtue</HI> of the <HI>moral creation,</HI> together with all the happine&s;s dependant thereon, &s;hould be endangered, through want of &s;uch a provi&s;ion for their &s;ecurity? The plain truth is, the benevolence of the <HI>Deity,</HI> is not confined to particular beings, or orders of beings, but is ab&s;olutely <HI>univer&s;al</HI>; and ought therefore to be conceived of as exerting it&s;elf in tho&s;e ways which are be&s;t adapted to advance the <HI>general good</HI> of the creation. And if, by connecting <HI>mi&s;ery</HI> with <HI>moral irregularity,</HI> this end is, in the mo&s;t effectual manner, promoted, as we have &s;een rea&s;on to think it is, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;uch a connection, notwith&s;tanding what may eventually happen to particular individuals, mu&s;t be an argument of <HI>goodne&s;s,</HI> rather than of <HI>incon&s;i&s;tency</HI> with it.</P>
<P>There is yet another way wherein it may be for the <HI>good</HI> of the <HI>intelligent</HI> creation, that wic|kedne&s;s &s;hould be connected, in the manner it is, with <HI>mi&s;ery.</HI> What I intend is, that by this connection <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> is given for &s;uch mani|fe&s;tations of the Divine glory, as are <HI>ration|ally</HI> and powerfully &s;uited to promote the vir|tue, and <HI>con&s;equent</HI> happine&s;s, of <HI>moral</HI> beings; which manife&s;tations there would have been no room for, or, at lea&s;t, not in &s;o great a degree, had it not been for <HI>this connection.</HI> It is evi|dently from hence, that mo&s;t of the <HI>moral</HI> at|tributes of the <HI>Deity</HI> become capable of a <HI>more</HI>

illu&s;trious di&s;play, than would otherwi&s;e have been po&s;&s;ible: And it may be, <HI>&s;ome</HI> of them <HI>could</HI> not have been manife&s;ted at all, had not this given the opportunity therefor. The <HI>ho|line&s;s</HI> of the Divine Being would not have ap|peared &s;o con&s;picuous, if <HI>moral</HI> agents might have behaved ill, and not found it to their di&s;advantage: Neither would his <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> have &s;hone with &s;uch a di&s;tingui&s;hing lu&s;tre; as he could not, &s;o fully and impartially, have ren|dered to them according to their de&s;erts. And, as to the various modifications of goodne&s;s, &s;uch as mercy, forbearance, patience, long-&s;uf|fering, forgivene&s;s, it does not appear, how the&s;e perfections of the <HI>Deity</HI> could have been at all di&s;played, had it not been for the&s;e evils that are the con&s;equent fruit of voluntary mi&s;con|duct. The idea of pity, and mercy, and par|don, as Divine attributes, exerci&s;ed towards mo|ral agents, is e&s;&s;entially connected with their <HI>actual &s;uffering,</HI> or, at lea&s;t, <HI>liablene&s;s</HI> to it, on account of their ill-doings: in&s;omuch, that, were it not for the unhappine&s;s we become ob|noxious to, upon being faulty in their beha|vior, they could have had no notion of the&s;e amiable, Divine glories. And it is from hence that tho&s;e marvellous di&s;plays of goodne&s;s, in the&s;e modes of exerci&s;e, have taken ri&s;e, which tend, not only to the eternal honor of the <HI>Deity,</HI> but the be&s;t and greate&s;t good likewi&s;e of moral and intelligent beings. Nor is it difficult to conceive how the di&s;play of the&s;e attributes of
<PB N="246" REF="018397_0244_0FA70BE3C84537D0">
the Supreme Creator &s;hould operate to this end. For it is obvious, upon the &s;lighte&s;t attention, that riches of forbearance, long-&s;uffering and forgivene&s;s, are naturally adapted to work pow|erfully upon <HI>intelligent</HI> minds, if they have been faulty, to lead them to repentance, and bring them back to the practice of virtue, the only way to true happine&s;s. And, perhaps, &s;o long as there are any remains of ingenuity, no|thing is more rationally &s;uited to produce this effect. And where any, under the influence of the&s;e Divine di&s;plays, have been recovered to a virtuous di&s;po&s;ition, there are no motives better fitted to &s;trengthen and e&s;tabli&s;h it, than tho&s;e which may be &s;elected from that pity and mercy, which the <HI>Deity</HI> has exerci&s;ed towards them. Be&s;ides, there will be the excitement of pious affections in their minds towards the <HI>Divine Being,</HI> accompanied with <HI>high plea&s;ure</HI>; which plea&s;ure they could never have perceiv|ed, but in this method of conduct. And, I may add, this &s;ame goodne&s;s of the <HI>Deity,</HI> appear|ing in his lenity, and patience, and mercy, to|wards guilty moral agents, is as naturally fitted to produce, in <HI>other</HI> intelligent beings, who are not the <HI>immediate</HI> objects of it, &s;uch &s;entiments and affections, attended with corre&s;ponding de|light, which they could not otherwi&s;e have been the &s;ubjects of; whereby both the virtue and happine&s;s of the rational and moral creation is better provided for, than it could have been in a different &s;tate of things.</P>

<HI>proverbs</HI> as old as <HI>Solomon, a fooli&s;h &s;on is the heavine&s;s of his mother</HI>; and again a <HI>fooli&s;h &s;on is a grief to his father.</HI> And the con&s;equences of oppre&s;&s;ion, rapine and violence, whether public or private, mu&s;t be felt and groaned under, in a world, where creatures are &s;o nearly allied to, and dependant on, each other. Nay, the <HI>penal</HI> evils, which the <HI>Deity</HI> may, in kindne&s;s, inflict to &s;top the progre&s;s of wickedne&s;s, mu&s;t, many times, touch the <HI>innocent</HI> as well as guilty, while they live mixed together, as in the pre&s;ent &s;tate: Nor could it be otherwi&s;e without an inver&s;ion of the cour&s;e of nature. So that, if this objection proves any thing, it is that &s;uch an order of beings ought not to have been crea|ted. But we have already &s;een, that the <HI>Deity</HI> was not obliged to make only the mo&s;t perfect beings; yea, that the communication of the <HI>greate&s;t good</HI> required the creation of all ranks of beings, in the de&s;cending line, &s;o long as the enjoyment of exi&s;tence could be called an happine&s;s. Nor may &s;uch creatures as we are, who have &s;o narrow a view of the works of God, and the whole &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e, take upon us to &s;ay, that an order of beings con&s;tituted as we are, could not, in con&s;i&s;tency with wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, have a place in the creation; or that &s;uch creatures, with all the evils to which they are &s;ubjected, would not make a beautiful, nece&s;&s;ary part, in the Divine plan, contrived to form a &s;cene wherein the perfections of the <HI>Deity</HI> might be mo&s;t admira|bly
<PB N="249" REF="018397_0247_0FA70BE5EC9E35F0">
di&s;played in producing, upon the whole, the <HI>greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible good.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it ought to be con&s;idered, that <HI>the&s;e evils,</HI> which wicked men bring upon others by their vices, are &s;uppo&s;ed to bear hard upon the <HI>benevolence</HI> of the Creator and Governor of the univer&s;e, chiefly on the <HI>pre&s;umption,</HI> that the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> is an <HI>entire independent</HI> &s;tate, not having relation to, or connection with, any <HI>future</HI> ex|i&s;tence: Upon which &s;uppo&s;ition, it is owned, the difficulty objected would be an un|&s;urmountable one. But will any pretend to <HI>demon&s;trate,</HI> that there is no <HI>future</HI> &s;tate, that death puts a total end to the being of man, and all further capacity of enjoyment? And if this cannot be <HI>demon&s;trated,</HI> which mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed to be the truth of the matter, it is po&s;&s;ible, that the evils which any &s;uffer in <HI>this</HI> may be made up to them in <HI>another</HI> &s;tate: Nay, it is po&s;&s;i|ble, that the&s;e evils which they &s;uffer may be intended as a <HI>means</HI> to prepare and qualify them for <HI>greater happine&s;s,</HI> in &s;ome future period of exi&s;tence, than they could otherwi&s;e have en|joyed. And this leads to another remark of great importance in the pre&s;ent argument, which is,</P>
<P>That the evils &s;uffered by &s;ome, through the faulty conduct of others, are &s;o over-ruled, in the all-wi&s;e, gracious government of the <HI>Deity,</HI> as to give occa&s;ion for the exerci&s;e and improve|ment of &s;uch virtues as tend to promote their <HI>greater</HI> happine&s;s. Vice, it is true, has intro|duced
<PB N="250" REF="018397_0248_0FA70BE971516590">
into the world a great many trials, griev|ous to bear: But it is as true, that they are capable of being improved to advantage. And what though any &s;hould &s;uffer through the caprice, the pride, the hatred, the malice, and other ungoverned pa&s;&s;ions and lu&s;ts of wicked men, if they may hereby be gainers in the end? And this is made po&s;&s;ible as the <HI>Deity</HI> has con|&s;tituted things. For the&s;e very di&s;tre&s;&s;es, which are cau&s;ed by the prevalence of &s;in and folly, are &s;o many opportunities offered, in provi|dence, for the exerci&s;e of meekne&s;s, patience, forgivene&s;s, and the like virtues; which, being often, by this means, thrown out into action, be|come &s;ettled <HI>moral di&s;po&s;itions,</HI> not only forming a mo&s;t beautiful character, but together with it a <HI>capacity</HI> for happine&s;s, which could not otherwi&s;e have been enjoyed. It is certain, that the exertment of the mind, in one par|ticular way, is the method, according to the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of nature, by which it con|tracts a faculty in this way of exertion, and becomes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of what we call <HI>habits,</HI> in any kind. And it is as certain, that <HI>opportu|nities</HI> offered, in the cour&s;e of providence, for the frequent repetition of the&s;e exertments, are the <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> by which the mind receives that corre&s;ponding <HI>bent,</HI> or <HI>turn,</HI> to which we give the name, <HI>habit</HI> or <HI>di&s;po&s;ition.</HI> From whence it follows, that the evils &s;uffered through the fault of others, as they give opportunity for acts of meekne&s;s, and forbearance, and for|givene&s;s,
<PB N="251" REF="018397_0249_0FA70BE98ED79750">
are properly adapted to form the vir|tuous di&s;po&s;itions an&s;wering to the&s;e acts. And accordingly it is &s;een, in fact, that none among men are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e excellent virtues, in &s;o confirmed a degree, as tho&s;e who have taken occa&s;ion, from the evils they have &s;uffered, to be much in the exerci&s;e of acts of patience, contentment, and re&s;ignation. They have, by this means, got formed in them, and greatly &s;trengthened, the di&s;po&s;itions to the&s;e virtues. Nor is this all: But their <HI>capacity</HI> for moral rational happine&s;s is thereby proportionably enlarged. The&s;e virtues, when called forth in|to exerci&s;e, are, at pre&s;ent, rewarded with <HI>plea&s;ure,</HI> and &s;uch plea&s;ure as none know the value of but tho&s;e who have felt what it is, Be&s;ides which, there is no rea&s;on to think but that, in &s;ome other and future &s;tate, they &s;hall further reap the fruit of their <HI>moral improvements,</HI> in an&s;werable mea&s;ures of rational &s;atisfaction and delight. To be &s;ure, it cannot be prov|ed, that this may not; yea, that it will not, be the ca&s;e. And upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, it is ea&s;y to conceive, how the evils which good men have &s;uffered, through the wickedne&s;s of their fellow creatures, may finally turn out to their benefit. What &s;pecial u&s;e there may be, in <HI>another</HI> &s;tate, for tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions which have been formed in <HI>this,</HI> and particularly &s;uited to trials from the perver&s;e behaviour of others, we know not: But thus much we may be &s;ure of, that virtuous habits, by what means &s;oever they
<PB N="252" REF="018397_0250_0FA70BEA4942A2D0">
have been formed, improved, and &s;trengthen|ed, do enlarge the general capacity for ration|al moral happine&s;s; in&s;omuch, that, if there is anothere is another &s;tate, the &s;ubjects of them, on this account, mu&s;t be the more happy in proportionable returns of true and &s;olid plea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>The &s;um of the whole argument is this, that the <HI>connection of unhappine&s;s with moral irregula|rity</HI> is a means wi&s;ely adapted to operate pow|erfully upon <HI>rational moral</HI> agents, to reduce them to a right conduct, if they have been faulty, and to pre&s;erve them inviolable in their attachment to virtue, if they have been inno|cent: In&s;omuch, that it may be owing to this <HI>connection,</HI> there is &s;o much <HI>order</HI> and <HI>happine&s;s</HI> in the <HI>intelligent</HI> creation; of both which, had not this connection been con&s;tituted, there would undoubtedly have been much le&s;s than there now is, and has all along been. The con&s;equence wherefrom is, that this provi&s;ion, fitted for the production of &s;o much good, is &s;o far from being <HI>incon&s;i&s;tent with benevolence,</HI> that it is a &s;trong indication of it. And whereas the <HI>&s;ufferings</HI> of the virtuous, by the wickedne&s;s of the vicious, are great and trying, the&s;e al&s;o, upon &s;uppo&s;ition of <HI>another</HI> &s;tate (which cannot be proved to be an <HI>unrea&s;onable,</HI> much le&s;s an <HI>impo&s;&s;i|ble</HI> one) may be, in the end, for their <HI>advantage</HI>; as they are capable of being improved &s;o as that the fruit, upon the whole, &s;hall be <HI>more</HI> happine&s;s, than if the&s;e &s;ufferings had not been
<PB N="253" REF="018397_0251_0FA70BEB50BFE720">
endured: And if they may po&s;&s;ibly be a <HI>means</HI> to produce <HI>greater</HI> good, they cannot prove a deficiency in the benevolence of the <HI>Deity,</HI> but are rather an argument in proof that he is endowed with this attribute.</P>
<P>I have now offered what I had to &s;ay in il|lu&s;tration of the <HI>con&s;i&s;tency</HI> between <HI>infinite be|nevolence,</HI> and <HI>moral irregularity,</HI> together with all its <HI>con&s;equent unhappine&s;s.</HI> And I &s;ee not, upon the review, but the rea&s;oning employed to this purpo&s;e is &s;trictly conclu&s;ive. <HI>God</HI> ha|ving created <HI>free agents,</HI> it appears, from what has been di&s;cour&s;ed, that they are the proper and &s;ole cau&s;es of all the moral di&s;order that is com|plained of, and not the <HI>Deity</HI>; who has done every thing that he <HI>could,</HI> in con&s;i&s;tency with rea&s;on and wi&s;dom, not only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o prevent their abu&s;e of their faculties, but to promote their improvement of them &s;o as to attain to the highe&s;t perfection and happine&s;s: And further, that the very <HI>evils,</HI> he has connected with their <HI>voluntary mi&s;conduct,</HI> are kindly intended, and wi&s;ely adapted, to bring about their <HI>be&s;t good,</HI> and will certainly do it, if it is not their own <HI>fault.</HI> So that, upon the whole, it cannot be conceived, what the <HI>Deity</HI> could have done more, in a wi&s;e and rational method of opera|tion, to have made <HI>intelligent moral</HI> beings, in all their <HI>various orders,</HI> as happy as their origi|nal capacities would allow of: Which is as much as can be expected, even from <HI>benevo|lence</HI> that is <HI>infinite.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="018397_0252_0FA70BEE215B69D8">It now remains to con&s;ider the third and la&s;t objection to the infinite benevolence of the Deity. And this is taken from the <HI>natural</HI> evils, common to all perceiving beings, in this world of our's, in all their cla&s;&s;es, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t; &s;uch as pains, di&s;ea&s;es, and di&s;a&s;ters, in various kinds, and degrees; and, at la&s;t, death, mo&s;tly accompanied with di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;ometimes with aggravated cir|cum&s;tances of mi&s;ery and torment. And the complaint upon this head is, that the&s;e evils are not only permitted by the Deity, but were, in a &s;en&s;e, appointed; as being the effect of that con&s;titution of things, which he contrived, and e&s;tabli&s;hed, and has all along upheld: Nay, it is urged, with re&s;pect to &s;ome of the&s;e evils, as to their kind, if not degree, that the Deity intended they &s;hould take place, and originally endowed the creatures with &s;uch na|tures, as that a liablene&s;s to them was ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary. And would an infinitely be|nevolent Being, &s;ay the movers of this objec|tion, have brought creatures into exi&s;tence under &s;uch circum&s;tances, &s;ubjected, by the very laws of their nature, to pain and mi&s;ery? Does this look like the doing of &s;upremely perfect goodne&s;s? Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;uch a &s;tate of things could have been, if ori|ginally planned, and all along conducted by a Being e&s;&s;entially, and infinitely kind and good?</P>
<P>I an&s;wer by acknowledging, that the percei|ving beings of all orders, in this lower world,
<PB N="255" REF="018397_0253_0FA70BEF08E2C7C0">
are liable to pain, and death; and that they were made thus liable by the God, who gave them exi&s;tence under &s;uch circum&s;tances, as that the&s;e evils could not be avoided. Only, let it be remembered, and con&s;idered, before I come to a particular re&s;olution of this diffi|culty,</P>
<P>That even the&s;e <HI>natural</HI> evils, &s;o far as man|kind are concerned in them, are all of them increa&s;ed in their malignity, by means of that <HI>moral</HI> di&s;order, which they have introduced into the world. And to this &s;ame cau&s;e, and not to the Author of our beings it is owing al&s;o, that the <HI>kinds</HI> of natural evils are become more numerous. Had it not been for the lu&s;ts of men, we &s;hould never have heard of many tormenting di&s;ea&s;es, which multitudes now lie groaning under. And as to tho&s;e which were unavoidable, in con&s;equence of the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of nature, they would have been comparatively few, and attended with only tolerable degrees of pain. An intempe|rate, luxurious, debauched cour&s;e of living, through the prevalence of ungoverned appetite, and &s;en&s;ual inclination, in oppo&s;ition to the dictates of rea&s;on, and the remon&s;trances of con&s;cience, is that which has aggravated, as well as multiplied, the evils of the world. It is therefore very unfair to take occa&s;ion, from the vexations and &s;orrows of human life, in its pre&s;ent degenerate &s;tate, to reflect di&s;honor on the goodne&s;s of the Deity. The only ju&s;t
<PB N="256" REF="018397_0254_0FA70BF1CF9D67F0">
way of forming an impartial judgment, in the ca&s;e, is, to con&s;ider the&s;e evils, not as multi|plied and aggravated, through men's pervert|ing their powers, and acting counter to the rules pre&s;cribed for the government of them; but as it may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed, they would have taken place, according to the cour&s;e of nature, not hindered in its regular opera|tion. The mi&s;eries that infect the human &s;pe|cies, in the former view, are the &s;ole fruit of their own folly, not an effect of God's produ|cing, for which men them&s;elves, and not God, are an&s;werable: Though I may add here, his goodne&s;s is &s;uch, that he has done every thing fit and proper, that even the&s;e evils of men's own bringing upon them&s;elves may turn out, in the end, to their final good, as we have al|ready &s;een. In the latter view only of the evils of life is di&s;covered the proper effect of tho&s;e laws of nature, which the Deity has e&s;tabli&s;h|li&s;hed, and which we are, at pre&s;ent, called to con&s;ider, in order to vindicate his &s;upreme benevolence.</P>
<P>And here it may be again proper, before I proceed to the particular evils complained of as incon&s;i&s;tences with the Divine goodne&s;s, to ob&s;erve in <HI>general,</HI> that they are the effects of e&s;tabli&s;hed laws, the de&s;ign and tendency of which are greatly beneficial. And though they may be, in &s;ome in&s;tances, more e&s;pecial|ly at certain times, the occa&s;ion of evil, they are notwith&s;tanding eventually productive
<PB N="257" REF="018397_0255_0FA70BF28B514B08">
of a va&s;t overbalance of good. The air we breath in may, in con&s;equence of the laws of nature, be &s;ometimes &s;ubjected to tho&s;e hetero|geneous mixtures, which will, until it is purified, make it of &s;uch an ill temperature, as to oc|ca&s;ion hurt both to man and bea&s;t; but yet, life it&s;elf in all animals, without which there could be no enjoyment, is ab&s;olutely depen|dant on it, and pre&s;erved by means of it. Fire, conformably to the laws of nature, may unhappily be the occa&s;ion of exten&s;ively ruin|ous de&s;olation; while yet, it is one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful creatures of God. Storms and tempe&s;ts, thunder and lightning, may &s;ometimes be the cau&s;es of no &s;mall hurt, by de&s;troying the lives, or &s;ub&s;tance, of numbers of individuals; bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by clearing the air, and di&s;engaging it from tho&s;e noxious exhalations that were blended with it, it fits it for re&s;piration, and in this way does good, beyond all compari&s;on for &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the evil it ever brings into event. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of earthquakes, inun|dations, famines, and pe&s;tilences, they are the effects of laws, which are not only, in that ge|neral tendency, good, but actually produce more and greater good, than they ever do evil In &s;hort, the laws of nature are all of the be|neficial kind, and we feel that they are &s;o, by the enjoyment of innumerable good things, which are the effects of their operation; and the evils they may, at any time, be the occa|&s;ion
<PB N="258" REF="018397_0256_0FA70BF375232640">
of, are not worthy of being mentioned, they are &s;o much over-balanced with good.</P>
<P>And it may be, upon the whole, be&s;t, in this world of our's, that general laws &s;hould be &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed, as that evils &s;hould &s;ometimes be occa&s;ioned by them. The final cau&s;e of &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment might be the good, par|ticularly of mankind. A world, in which there is a mixture of evil with good, may be mo&s;t &s;uitable for &s;uch creatures as we are. Were the laws of nature &s;uch as to leave no room for tho&s;e occa&s;ions of &s;orrow, fear, and &s;uffering, we are now &s;ubjected to, this earth might have been a place altogether unadapted for training us up for the enjoyment of God, the &s;upreme good. It was, perhaps, highly expedient, if not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that we &s;hould live in a world of <HI>di&s;cipline,</HI> a world that would, in the natural cour&s;e of things, be the occa&s;ion of dif|ficulties, inconveniences, and trials, by means of which we might be formed to a meetne&s;s for another world, in which we &s;hould be totally freed from them. An uninterrupted &s;tate of ea&s;e and plea&s;ure, would, morally &s;peaking, be the ruin of mankind. We need a mixture of evil with good to check our pride, to re&s;train our &s;en&s;ual appetites; to take off our affections from the things of the earth; and to excite in us a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of our depend|ance on God. And we need al&s;o, every now and then, to be alarmed by this or that di&s;|pen&s;ation, which &s;hall &s;peak with a voice more
<PB N="259" REF="018397_0257_0FA70BF436796B58">
loud and awful, than is common and ordinary. The inhabitants of the world in general, and tho&s;e of this or the other place, in &s;pecial, are &s;ometimes &s;unk into a &s;tate of &s;uch carele&s;ne&s;s and &s;tupidity, have &s;o little faith in God, and are &s;o given up to commit all iniquity with greedine&s;s, that, humanly &s;peaking, there is no room left to expect their reformation and amendment, but by &s;uch manife&s;tations of the power, the greatne&s;s, and maje&s;ty of God, as even force a faith in him, and a &s;erious atten|tion to his character as the moral Governor of the world. The cour&s;e of nature is, according|ly, wi&s;ely and mercifully adapted to both the&s;e ends; giving occa&s;ion, at all times, for <HI>di&s;ci|plinary</HI> trials; and bringing on al&s;o, at certain intervals, &s;uch tremendous events as are pow|erfully &s;uited to alarm their fears, and engage them to betake them&s;elves to a better cour&s;e of conduct. And it is highly probable, the all-wi&s;e good God has &s;o adju&s;ted the laws of nature, as that they &s;hall operate, in all ages, and in all places, &s;o as may be&s;t an&s;wer his benevolent de&s;igns in the moral government of his intel|ligent creatures. What I mean is, he may have &s;ettled &s;uch laws, with re&s;pect to natural cau&s;es, may have &s;o proportioned their force, &s;phere of action, degree and manner of opera|tion, as that, under his all-powerful and all-wi&s;e concurring influence, they &s;hall con&s;pire together to produce tho&s;e effects, at &s;uch times, and in &s;uch places, which may be &s;uited to
<PB N="260" REF="018397_0258_0FA70BF4F65F9610">
their moral &s;tate, and &s;erve for warning, or correction, or ruin, as he &s;hould judge mo&s;t ex|pedient. It is from the&s;e laws of nature, that tempe&s;ts, famines, pe&s;tilences, earthquakes, and the like evils, take their ri&s;e. And they may rea&s;onably be viewed as the <HI>great in&s;truments</HI> of providence. It is by the&s;e, at lea&s;t in part, that God keeps this degenerate world within re&s;traint. Were it not for the di&s;plays he makes, at proper times, and in proper places, of his being, perfections, and governing providence, in the&s;e ways of terror, mankind might, at length, forget there was a God, or live as though there was none.</P>
<P>But it will, perhaps, be &s;aid here, why &s;hould beings be made &s;o imperfect as to need a con|&s;titution of things, in con&s;equence of which there would unavoidably be the&s;e <HI>evils</HI>? Could not the Deity have make mankind, in particu|lar, more perfect, and placed them in a world, in which, conformably to e&s;tabli&s;hed laws, they might have enjoyed good without any mixture of evil? And if he could, would he not have done it, if infinitely benevolent? The&s;e que&s;|tions, and all other of a &s;imilar kind, are only &s;o many vague, un&s;upported &s;ugge&s;tions, im|porting, that a world, &s;o con&s;tituted as our's is, could not, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of infinite bene|volence, have been brought into exi&s;tence. But this is &s;o far from being a truth, that, had not the Deity created &s;uch a world as this in which we live, he would not have manife&s;ted &s;o
<PB N="261" REF="018397_0259_0FA70BF5CACDEE20">
much benevolence, as he might have done, and ac|tually has done. It has been already &s;aid, and large|ly proved, that there may be the communicati|on of more good by the creation of a diver&s;ity of beings, variou&s;ly capable of happine&s;s, from the greate&s;t conceivable height, quite down to the lowe&s;t. It is therefore no objection again&s;t in|finite benevolence, that all beings are not a|like perfect, but rather a proof of it; becau&s;e the le&s;s perfect, in all their gradations, &s;o long as they are at all capable of enjoyment, in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing, increa&s;e the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m total of good. Why then &s;hould they be excluded the creation? Why &s;hould not our world, imperfect as it is in compari&s;on with other worlds, have been brought into exi&s;tence, with all its inhabitants, animal and rational, however low &s;ome of them may be in their capacities for the perception of happi|ne&s;s? They are all, according to their &s;everal ranks, capable of plea&s;ure, and actually enjoy it, and an over-balance of it, notwith&s;tanding all the evils they are liable to. If therefore they had not been made, nor the world in which they live, becau&s;e &s;o con&s;tituted as &s;ometimes to be the occa&s;ion of evil, the place they now &s;u&s;|tain in the creation would have a va&s;t void. And what a mighty cha&s;m in nature would this have been the means of? How much le&s;&s;ened mu&s;t have been that good, which might have been communicated? None of that hap|pine&s;s would have been po&s;&s;ible, which is now enjoyed, has been, and may hereafter be en|joyed,

by innumerable beings which have exi&s;t|ed, and may in future time exi&s;t, on this earth. And is it not more for the honor of the bene|volent Deity, that this happine&s;s &s;hould have been communicated, than that he &s;hould have withheld it? In a diver&s;ified creation, there mu&s;t be a diver&s;ity in the di&s;plays of goodne&s;s, &s;hould they proceed even from an infinitely be|nevolent being. If the di&s;plays of goodne&s;s, therefore, in the con&s;titution of our world, and the innumerably various creatures in it, are <HI>le&s;s</HI> than in the con&s;titution of other worlds, and the creatures in them, it is no other than might rea&s;onably be looked for. There is, beyond all controver&s;y, more benevolence di&s;covered in making &s;uch a world as our's, than if the place it occupies in the creation had been a blank? And what is more, for aught any man living can prove to the contrary, or pretend without arrogance to prove, it may be a fit link in that chain of exi&s;tence, which God may have intended for as full a manife&s;tation of his be|nevolence, as, in his infinite wi&s;dom, he has judged proper.&mdash;But, in&s;tead of enlarging any further here, I &s;hall rather proceed</P>
<P>To a more direct an&s;wer to the objection again&s;t the infinite benevolence of the Deity, as fetched from tho&s;e <HI>natural</HI> evils, which all the percipient beings in our world, and mankind in &s;pecial, are, from their very make, and the laws of nature, &s;ubjected to. And here I &s;hall be <HI>particular</HI> in enumerating the principal of
<PB N="263" REF="018397_0261_0FA70BF7161624F0">
the&s;e evils, and endeavor to account for them, in con&s;i&s;tency with goodne&s;s, &s;hould it be &s;up|po&s;ed to be infinite, but guided, at the &s;ame time, by unerring wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t evil complained of is <HI>pain.</HI> This indeed is nearly connected with mo&s;t of the other evils, and con&s;titutes &s;o great a part of them, that it might be con&s;idered in general, and the an&s;wer to it, if ju&s;t, e&s;teemed a full reply to them all. But I chu&s;e rather to &s;peak to it di&s;tinctly, and particularly, as one of the evils objected to. It is &s;uppo&s;ed in the objec|tion, that it is in it&s;elf an evil, and &s;uch an one as there was no occa&s;ion for, and could not have had exi&s;tence from an infinitely bene|volent Being. But this may be a great mi&s;|take. Pain, in a relative view, and as intro|duced into &s;uch a world as our's, may lo&s;e its nature as an ab&s;olute evil, and be rather wor|thy of being called a real good.</P>
<P>Some have endeavoured to account for pain, &s;o as to make it con&s;i&s;t with goodne&s;s, by &s;aying, that it gives a quicker and &s;tronger reli&s;h for plea&s;ure; and that plea&s;ure could not have been felt, at lea&s;t in many ca&s;es, and with &s;o high a gu&s;t, had it not been for pre|ceeding experience of the thing meant by the &s;en&s;ation of pain. But it is evident, beyond all rea&s;onable di&s;pute, that there may be the perception of plea&s;ure without any previous perception of pain; becau&s;e this is the real truth with re&s;pect to him, who is God over all
<PB N="264" REF="018397_0262_0FA70BF92EDF4C50">
ble&s;&s;ed forever more. It will not be pretend|ed, that the perfectly and infinitely happy Be|ing ever knew what pain was, from any ex|perience he ever had, or could have, of it within him&s;elf. And it is po&s;&s;ible, I might rather &s;ay highly probable, that there are crea|ted beings of a &s;uperior order to the noble&s;t in our world, who never felt pain; having never had occa&s;ion, or rea&s;on for &s;uch percep|tion.</P>
<P>Others, in vindication of the Divine bene|volence, have &s;uppo&s;ed, that the con&s;titution, particularly, of man, is &s;o exqui&s;itely nice, that a touch upon his nervous &s;y&s;tem will oc|ca&s;ion plea&s;ure, or pain, according to the de|gree and manner in which it is done; and that the bodily mechani&s;m is &s;uch, that it could not have been otherwi&s;e. But this, per|haps, is going too far beyond the ken of human under&s;tanding. We know not, nor is it po&s;&s;ible we &s;hould know, the height, or depth, of that contriving &s;kill which is a glory peculiar to the Infinite Mind.</P>
<P>The true and proper an&s;wer to the objected difficulty we are con&s;idering is this, that all the perceiving beings in our world, whether rational or irrational, of an higher or lower or|der, were &s;ubjected to the &s;en&s;ation of pain, not for its own &s;ake, but in wi&s;dom and kindne&s;s, that it might be an excitement to their care in providing for the &s;upport and comfort of life, and that it might al&s;o keep them upon their
<PB N="265" REF="018397_0263_0FA70BF9476860A8">
guard again&s;t whatever might be hurtful to them. We men, though the fir&s;t order of be|ings on this earth, are, comparatively &s;peaking, but low creatures, perhaps the lowe&s;t among all the moral exi&s;tences in the creation of God; and as we are &s;uch imperfect creatures, and live in a world wherein we are &s;urrounded with dangers, and liable to innumerable di&s;a&s;|ters, and attacks upon our health and life, <HI>pain</HI> appears to be a wi&s;e and benevolent provi&s;ion of the God of nature for our holding exi&s;t|ence with any tolerable degree of &s;afety. This has been already illu&s;trated, Part II. to which I &s;hall only add, the &s;phere of our under&s;tand|ing is &s;o limited, and &s;uch the danger of our being expo&s;ed, in thou&s;ands of ca&s;es, to the lo&s;s of health, limbs, and life it&s;elf, that our greate&s;t &s;ecurity is this &s;en&s;ation of pain. It &s;upplies the deficiencies in our make, and a&s;&s;i&s;ts our fee|ble powers, by being a con&s;tant, alarming mo|nitor, calling upon us in time to provide for our well-being, and to guard our&s;elves again&s;t wounds, brui&s;es, di&s;tempers, and whatever might be di&s;advantageous, or de&s;tructive to us.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid here, what need of &s;o trou|ble&s;ome a &s;en&s;ation as this of pain to guard us again&s;t dangers, and di&s;orders? Might not this have been done in a more ea&s;y way, and yet as effectual an one? And if it might, how comes it to pa&s;s that it was not? Would not an infi|nitely benevolent Being have been thus kind to his creatures?</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="018397_0264_0FA70BFA1197DC48">The an&s;wer is obvious. The making &s;uch an order of imperfect beings as we are, has been already accounted for, and &s;hewn to be con&s;i|&s;tent with infinitely wi&s;e benevolence. This being &s;o, a more kind expedient could not have been contrived, for&s;uch creatures as we are, &s;o far as we are able to judge, than the &s;en&s;a|tion of pain, for our &s;ecurity from danger, and hurt, and to promote our real welfare. Mo&s;t certainly, no one is able to point out a better, or to make it evident there could have been a better. Was it not for this expedient, mankind, notwith&s;tanding the utmo&s;t efforts of their rea|&s;on, wi&s;dom, and fore&s;ight, would, in innume|rable in&s;tances, run into danger, and expo&s;e them&s;elves to thou&s;ands of difficulties, and in|conveniences, they are, by this contrivance of the Divine &s;kill and goodne&s;s, in a great mea|&s;ure freed from. It is indeed &s;o u&s;eful, I might more ju&s;tly &s;ay &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, an ingredient in the human con&s;titution, that it would be &s;carce po&s;&s;ible life &s;hould be pre&s;erved without it.

<P>Be&s;ides all which, it ought to be con&s;idered, that we men are moral, and not meerly animal, beings; and it might be in the view of our be|nevolent Creator, by means of this &s;en&s;ation of pain, he has made us capable of, to re&s;tain us from luxury, intemperance, lewdne&s;s, and de|bauchery, an indulgence to which would be hurtful to our &s;ouls as well as bodies, deba&s;ing
<PB N="267" REF="018397_0265_0FA70BFAD44F7298">
our nature, and bringing us down to a level with the very brutes; than which nothing would be more di&s;honorary to the God who made us, or greater reproach to our&s;elves as moral and intelligent agents. By this expedient al&s;o, &s;o u&s;eful in &s;o many other re&s;pects, occa&s;ion is of|fered, e&s;pecially in certain ca&s;es, and at certain times, for the formation and improvement of the virtues, patience, meekne&s;s, contentment, and re&s;ignation to the all-wi&s;e, righteous, and holy Governor of the world, which may be greatly &s;erviceable to us here, and abundantly more &s;o in &s;ome future &s;tate of exi&s;tence.&mdash; To go on to other evils complained of.</P>
<P>Such are hunger and thir&s;t, toil and labor, to all which we are &s;ubjected. But the&s;e, if con&s;idered as they ought to be, are &s;o far from being de&s;igned evils, that they were purpo&s;ely contrived for good, tend to good, nor could &s;uch imperfect creatures as we are have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed exi&s;tence &s;o well without, as with them.</P>
<P>The way in which the wi&s;dom of God has thought fit to manife&s;t his goodne&s;s in pre&s;erv|ing the lives he has be&s;towed on us, is by the u&s;e of <HI>food.</HI> Our bodies are &s;o con&s;tituted as that, even, their &s;olids are daily upon the wa&s;te, and their fluids in a perpetual flux; in&s;omuch that new acce&s;&s;ions of matter are nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply what falls off, and wears away. Death mu&s;t otherwi&s;e &s;oon, and unavoidably, be the affect. Now this &s;upply is made by eating and drinking; and to this we are urged, partly by
<PB N="268" REF="018397_0266_0FA70BFBF9B63F08">
the &s;atisfaction we naturally take in what we eat and drink, but principally by that hunger and thir&s;t, which, though, &s;ometimes heighten|ed to a degree that may be greatly trouble&s;ome, are yet nece&s;&s;ary, and bring far more plea&s;ure, than pain along with them. Was it not for the implantation of this expedient in our nature, we &s;hould be in danger of dying before our time, through negligence in providing, or throw|ing in, the recruits that are continually nece&s;|&s;ary for the &s;upport of our bodily &s;y&s;tem. Hunger and thir&s;t are what nature has made, and intended to give us warning of this danger, and to pu&s;h us on to a due care, to prevent, in time, tho&s;e inconveniences that would befall our bodies, if not &s;upplied with food and drink to &s;trengthen and uphold them.</P>
<P>But it will be &s;aid, what need of labor in or|der to procure the things needful for the body? Could not the earth, without the toil of man, have yielded a &s;ufficiency for his bodily &s;up|port? And would not this have been the con|&s;titution of nature, if an infinitely benevolent Cau&s;e had been at its head, as its Supreme Di|rector? I an&s;wer, Had the con&s;titution of na|ture been thus altered, there mu&s;t have been an analogous alteration in the make of man; other|wi&s;e greater inconveniences would have taken place, than tho&s;e that are now complained of, that is, the Deity would not have manife&s;ted &s;o much benevolence, as he has now done. Had the earth been &s;o made as that it &s;hould &s;pon|taneou&s;ly
<PB N="269" REF="018397_0267_0FA70BFC5EAA24B8">
have yielded its produce, and man's labour by this means, have been rendered needle&s;s, what would have been the con&s;equence but indo|lent in activity? And what the con&s;equence of that, but the lo&s;s of health, the want vigor and &s;pirit, and a general tediou&s;ne&s;s accompanying life? And what is more, the bringing on death much &s;oo|ner, and with more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing anxiety and pain, than would otherwi&s;e have been the ca&s;e. Inac|tion, and no exerci&s;e, naturally and powerfully tend to relax the &s;olid parts of the body, to wea|ken the circulation of the fluids, and &s;o to di&s;|order the &s;ecretions intended for the &s;maller ve&s;&s;els, as that, in&s;tead of affording them a pro|per &s;upply, they would fill them with ob&s;tructi|ons, which, if not removed, would effect a di&s;|&s;olution of the bodily machine, either &s;uddenly, or in a more &s;low and lingering way. With re&s;pect, therefore, to beings con&s;tituted as we are, labor is highly expedient; and it is a proof of benevolence, rather than an objection again&s;t it, that we are &s;ubjected to it. Mr. Addi&s;on has &s;et this in a beautiful, as well as clear and &s;trong point of light. His words, which none will think unworthy of tran&s;cribing, are the&s;e.&mdash;"I con&s;ider the body as a &s;y&s;tem of tubes and glands, or to u&s;e a more ru&s;tick phra&s;e, a bundle of pipes and &s;trainers, fitted to one another, after &s;o wonderful a manner, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as to make a proper engine to work with. This de&s;cription does not only comprehend the bowels, bones, tendons, veins, nerves, and ar|teries,
<PB N="270" REF="018397_0268_0FA70BFD1E5D0688">
but every mu&s;cle, and every ligature, which is a compo&s;ition of fibres that are &s;o many imperceptible tubes or pipes, interwoven on all &s;ides with invi&s;ible glands or &s;trainers. This general idea of a human body, without con&s;i|dering it in the niceties of anatomy, lets us &s;ee how ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary labor is for the right pre&s;ervation of it. There mu&s;t be fre|quent motions and agitations to mix, dige&s;t, and &s;eparate the jucies contained in it, as well as to clear and clean&s;e that infinitude of pipes and &s;trainers of which it is compo&s;ed, and to give their &s;olid parts a more firm and la&s;ting tone. Labor, or excerci&s;e ferments the humors, ca&s;ts them into their proper channels, throws off redundances, and helps nature in tho&s;e &s;e|cret di&s;tributions, without which the body can|not &s;ub&s;i&s;t in its vigor, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;oul act with chearfulne&s;s.

It is to a ne|glect in this particular that we mu&s;t a&s;cribe the &s;pleen, which is &s;o frequent in men of &s;tudious and &s;edentary tempers, as well as the vapors to which tho&s;e of the other &s;ex are &s;o often &s;ubject. Had not exerci&s;e been ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for our well-being, nature would not have made the body &s;o proper for it, by giving &s;uch an

activity to the limbs, and &s;uch a pliancy to every part as nece&s;&s;arily produces tho&s;e com|pre&s;&s;ions, exten&s;ions, contortions, dilatations, and all other kinds of motions that are nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of tubes and glands as has been before mentioned. And that we might not want inducements to engage us in &s;uch an exerci&s;e of the body as is proper for its welfare; it is &s;o ordered that nothing valuable can be procured without it. Not to mention riches and honor, even food and rai|ment are not to be come at without the toil of the hands, and &s;weat of the brows. Providence fur|ni&s;hes materials, but expects that we &s;hould work them up our&s;elves. The earth mu&s;t be labored before it gives its increa&s;e, and when it is for|ced into its &s;everal products, how many hand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mu&s;t they pa&s;s through before they are fit for u&s;e? Manufactures, trade, and agriculture, naturally employ more than nineteen parts of the &s;pecies in twenty; and as for tho&s;e who are not obliged to labor, by the condition in which they are born, they are more mi&s;erable than the re&s;t of mankind, unle&s;s they indulge them&s;elves in that voluntary labor, which goes by the name of exerci&s;e."&mdash;I &s;hall add here, if it was fit &s;uch an order of creatures as we men &s;hould have had a place in a &s;cale of beings indefinitely diver&s;e from each other, which no one, without high arrogance, will pretend to &s;ay, no rea&s;onable complaint can be made on account of that labor we are called to. It
<PB N="272" REF="018397_0270_0FA70BFE7574C8B0">
was indeed, for a &s;pecies of beings con&s;tituted as we are, nearly and nece&s;&s;arily connected with the welfare both of our &s;ouls and bodies. If we may pay any regard to the &s;acred books of revelations, Adam, even in paradi&s;e was obli|ged to labor; for he was put into the "gar|den of Eden to <HI>dre&s;s it.</HI>" The exerci&s;e he was called to might be different, in kind and degree, from that which falls to our &s;hare, as it is our lot to live on the earth &s;ince it was doomed to "bring forth thorns and thi&s;tles," that it might be an occa&s;ion of that toil and "&s;weat of face," without which we cannot earn the bread we eat. And, as the moral &s;tate of the world has been, from the time of the lap&s;e of the fir&s;t of our race, it may be be&s;t it &s;hould be thus, more conducive to the honor of God, and our own good, than otherwi&s;e it would have been.</P>
<P>It may properly be &s;ubjoined &s;till further, had it not been for the contrivance of <HI>labor,</HI> this earth would have been a rude wilderne&s;s: Nor &s;hould we have &s;een tho&s;e curious produc|tions of art, which are &s;o beautiful, and, at the &s;ame time beneficial, and delight&s;ome. How could we, without labor, have had hou&s;es accom|modated to the convenience and comfort of life, and other &s;tructures both ornamental and &s;erviceable? The world indeed is filled with a variety of works, innumerable in their kinds, adapted to gratify the &s;en&s;es, and an&s;wer ma|ny valuable purpo&s;es, which could not have
<PB N="273" REF="018397_0271_0FA70C002B0E1070">
been brought into effect without labor of body or mind, or both. And in vain, comparative|ly &s;peaking, were we formed with hands, and eyes, and various mechanical turns, had not the Creator intended we &s;hould labor: Nor would he have intended this, if a variety of wi&s;e and benevolent ends might not have been an&s;wered hereby; &s;ome of which we have pointed out, and might ea&s;ily have mentioned many more.</P>
<P>There are yet other evils complained of; among which are bodily di&s;orders in innume|rable kinds, e&s;pecially tho&s;e in con&s;equence of which &s;ome are idiots, and others di&s;tracted, and by this means not only objects of pity, but the occa&s;ion of no &s;mall trouble to their rela|tions, and &s;ometimes to the communities in which they live as individuals.</P>
<P>The exi&s;tence of the&s;e evils, in our world, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, is not denied. But it may be ju&s;tly que&s;tioned, whether they would have been either &s;o multiplied, or heightened in their malignity, had it not been for the prevalence of folly and vice, which is chargeable on us as its author, and not on God. Such indeed is our con&s;titution, and &s;uch the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of nature, that, a&s;ide from the wrong con|duct of mankind, there might have been &s;ome of the&s;e evils; but, without all doubt, they would have been far le&s;s in number, and far lighter in degree, in compari&s;on with what they now are. But be this as it may; as they are the effects of e&s;tabli&s;hed natural laws, intended
<PB N="274" REF="018397_0272_0FA70C00C2AE6AA8">
for good, and productive of it in innumerable in&s;tances, they ought not to be complained of; e&s;pecially, if it be remembered, that pre-e&s;ta|bli&s;hed general laws, for &s;uch a world as our's, are preferable to immediate, unrelated exertions of the Divine agency; and inconveniences may have been le&s;&s;ened, rather than increa&s;ed there|by. Were there no general laws; but every thing was effected by immediate, unrelated acts of Divine power, the bad con&s;equences ari&s;ing herefrom would be at once obvious. "There would be no arts and &s;ciences, no &s;kill or in|du&s;try; no regular methods of providing for our bodies, or improving our minds in the knowledge of things; all which evidently pre-&s;uppo&s;e, and are entirely founded on &s;ome &s;et|tled, certain laws of the univer&s;e di&s;coverable by us." The reader, if he plea&s;es, may turn to Part II, where he will find this point large|ly con&s;idered.</P>
<P>It may be further &s;aid here, as mankind are brought into exi&s;tence, not by immediate exertions of Divine power, but in con&s;equence of the general law of propagation, they are, in virtue of this law, &s;ubjected to evils, which would not have been prevented, but by an extra|ordinary interpo&s;ition of heaven, which, if com|mon, might be followed with more inconve|niences, for aught we can &s;ay to the contrary, than it would guard again&s;t. By a variety of ways, and means, this law of nature may be &s;o ob&s;tructed in its operation, or &s;uch a turn given
<PB N="275" REF="018397_0273_0FA70C0175019C50">
to it, as that children may come into the world with a bodily machine, unfitted for the &s;oul to work by; in con&s;equence of which &s;ome might be idiots, and &s;ome naturally turn wild. The&s;e ca&s;es, indeed, are comparatively rare. It is more common for children to derive from predece&s;&s;ors, and as the effect of their vices too&punc; bodily con&s;titutions &s;ubjecting them to infirmi|ties, and di&s;ea&s;es, various in kind, and &s;ome|times greatly afflictive in degree. And, per|haps, mo&s;t of the di&s;orders mankind groan un|der, e&s;pecially as to the malignant degree of them, are owing to this cau&s;e. But the&s;e in|conveniences notwith&s;tanding, it is better, beyond all compari&s;on better, this law &s;hould have been e&s;tabli&s;hed, than otherwi&s;e. For it is by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and not a continued exi&s;tence of the &s;ame individuals, that the human &s;pecies is pre&s;erved in being. And as this is not done by a con&s;tantly created &s;upply of individuals, how could it have been better effected, than by this law of propagation? E&s;pecially, if it be con&s;idered, that it has made way for the mani|fe&s;tation of riches of wi&s;dom, as well as good|ne&s;s, in the formation of different &s;exes, in the adju&s;tment of a different bodily organization, and the contrivance of natural propen&s;ions, all which are admirably fitted to bring into event the intention of this law. And it is &s;o clo&s;ely con|nected with other laws, good in them&s;elves, and productive of good; &s;uch as the law of love, particularly, between the &s;exes, which
<PB N="276" REF="018397_0274_0FA70C044566D7D0">
gives occa&s;ion for many reciprocal &s;ervices greatly beneficial, of which we could otherwi&s;e have had no idea; and the law of growth from infancy and childhood, to a &s;tate of maturity with re&s;pect to both mind and body, which makes way for thou&s;ands of kind offices in parents to|wards children, as al&s;o for the trial and im|provement of many important virtues: Such, I &s;ay, is the connection between the law of pro|pagation, and other laws of nature, that the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem mu&s;t, in many re&s;pects, have been altered, if this had not been e&s;tabli&s;hed; that is, in other words, this world mu&s;t have been another world, and not the world it now is: While yet, &s;uch a world as this is mu&s;t have been brought into exi&s;tence, or the Divine be|nevolence would not have been &s;o amply ma|nife&s;ted, as, by this means, it might be, and really has been.</P>
<P>There are two other evils &s;till particularly complained of; the &s;hortne&s;s of life, and the unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity of death.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, the brevity of life; it might be enough to &s;ay, in general, it was ordered by unerring wi&s;dom, and, at the &s;ame time, argues benevolence; as life, &s;hort as it is, is much preferable to non-exi&s;tence.&mdash;But we &s;hall be more particular in con&s;idering this complaint.</P>

but mu&s;t finally be re&s;olved by repair|ing to the all-wi&s;e plea&s;ure of Him, who is infinite in under&s;tanding, as well as goodne&s;s. All the &s;pecies of percipient beings, in our world, are &s;ubjected to the &s;ame general laws of na|ture; and yet, the time of the duration of their exi&s;tence is, notwith&s;tanding, greatly various. Some of the brutal kind are confined within the period of twenty or thirty years; others &s;eldom reach beyond fifteen or twenty; others &s;till are quite old at about ten or twelve. The like difference there is between the continuance of being in the animals of more inferior cla&s;&s;es. A &s;ingle year completes the time of exi&s;tence as to &s;ome of them; a few months as to others; and life may be much &s;horter, with re&s;pect to many of tho&s;e &s;pecies which are vi&s;ible to us, only by the help of gla&s;&s;es. This variety in the duration of life is, no doubt, effected by the operation of general laws, but then it mu&s;t be by the operation of tho&s;e laws, conformably to a <HI>peculiar difference of con&s;titution</HI> in the&s;e dif|ferent &s;pecies of creatures; and this, as alotted to them by God, and not to be accounted for, but by recurring to his all-wi&s;e good plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>This is eminently true, with re&s;pect to man. Notwith&s;tanding the general laws of nature, and their tendency to bring on a di&s;&s;olution of our bodily &s;tructure, no good philo&s;ophical rea&s;on can be given, why this di&s;&s;olution &s;hould be effected within &s;uch a general, limited time. If we may give credit to the Mo&s;aic hi&s;tory,

the Anti-Deluvian patriarchs lived, &s;ome of them at lea&s;t, till they were &s;ix, &s;even, eight, nine hundred years old: and it is particularly remarked of Methu&s;elah, that "his days were nine hundred and &s;ixty nine years:" Whereas, the life of man, from the time of the flood, has been confined within much narrower limits. About "&s;eventy years," according to the com|putation of king David, was the general period of life in his days; and &s;o it has been ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>Some have attempted to a&s;&s;ign the philo&s;o|phical rea&s;on of this difference in the period of human life. And, in order hereto, they have recurred to the natural firmne&s;s and vigor of the human con&s;titution, which, at fir&s;t, was propagated without tho&s;e contracted weakne&s;&s;es and decays, which have been gradually increa|&s;ing ever &s;ince, and de&s;cending from parents to children. And, together with the original &s;trength of the human &s;tructure, they have ta|ken into con&s;ideration the peculiar aptitude of the productions of nature to afford nutri|ment; which, they &s;uppo&s;e, were in their great|e&s;t perfection at fir&s;t, but have been conti|nually upon the decline. And, adding to the&s;e rea&s;ons, the <HI>kind of food,</HI> the fir&s;t generations of men lived upon, which, they imagine, was not <HI>fle&s;h,</HI> but <HI>the fruit of the earth</HI>; they think it not &s;trange, that their lives &s;hould be protracted to a period &s;o much longer, than the common term of life at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="018397_0277_0FA70C09C4050998">But however plau&s;ible this account may ap|pear to any, it is far from being &s;atisfactory; and in&s;uperable objections might ea&s;ily be made to it, if it would not occa&s;ion too great, and, what &s;ome may think, a needle&s;s degre&s;&s;ion. The truth is; after all that has been &s;aid by learned men to &s;olve this difficulty, it &s;till re|mains a my&s;tery in rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy. Nor can any thing be offered, with reference to its &s;olution, that may more rea&s;onably be acquie&s;c|ed in than this, So it plea&s;ed the &s;overeign good God; who, as he is the Creator of man, and of all the orders of inferior beings in our world, may a&s;&s;ign to him, and to them, what time of exi&s;tence he &s;hall judge fit. And the periods of life, however various in the various orders of creatures, were doubtle&s;s ordered in good|ne&s;s, as well as wi&s;dom. There is evidently an analogy between this diver&s;ity, and the di|ver&s;ity that takes place in the &s;everal cla&s;&s;es of beings; and it might be as fit there &s;hould be both the&s;e diver&s;ities, as either of them, in or|der to a wi&s;e and benevolent con&s;titution of the links in the chain of exi&s;tence.

<P>There are, mo&s;t certainly, good rea&s;ons, with re&s;pect to us men, why our years &s;hould not be lengthened beyond the general period

of &s;eventy or eighty. Our pre&s;ent life, as we are intelligent moral beings, ought, in agree|ment with philo&s;ophy as well as divinity, to be looked upon, not as intended for the enjoy|ment of the greate&s;t happine&s;s, we are made capable of, but rather as a probation-&s;ea&s;on that will finally i&s;&s;ue in it, in con&s;equence of an ac|quired meetne&s;s for it. This is the light, in which it is rea&s;onable we &s;hould view our life here on earth; and if the period, a&s;&s;igned for its continuance, is a duration &s;ufficiently long for the attainment of that perfection and hap|pine&s;s, which is the grand de&s;ign of God, it is, in true rea&s;on long enough: Nor would it be de&s;irable it &s;hould be protracted to a greater length. In &s;hort, our exi&s;tence, and continu|ance in it, in this world, were de&s;igned by our all-wi&s;e benevolent Creator for a quite dif|ferent purpo&s;e from what we are too commonly apt to imagine. He intended both, not &s;o much for the enjoyment of our highe&s;t happi|ne&s;s here, as to prepare us for it in a better &s;tate. This is the true and proper idea of life. And the limitation of its continuance is ad|mirably well adju&s;ted to this notion of it: Tho&s;e who are formed to a preparedne&s;s, by a wi&s;e and right improvement of their time, and talents, for an admi&s;&s;ion to the joys of God's pre&s;ence, will not complain of the &s;hort|ne&s;s of life. And as to others, who chiefly employ them&s;elves to the purpo&s;es of this, and not the coming world; who make no provi|&s;ion

for another &s;tate, but walk in the way of their hearts, and in the &s;ight of their eyes, fulfilling the de&s;ires of the fle&s;h and mind, the period of life is full long enough for their continuance here: Nor would it an&s;wer any valuable end, if it were of a &s;till greater length. In all probability, they would grow more bold and daring in iniquity, more hardened in vice, and more ripe for inhanced degrees of the Divine vengeance. Be&s;ides, the pre&s;ent term of life is, one would think, a &s;pace full long enough for &s;uch per&s;ons to be continued nu&s;an|ces to the world. And it is really a kindne&s;s to mankind in general, that they are limited, by the law of their nature, to three&s;core or four&s;core years.</P>
<P>The other evil, I mentioned as complained of, and the la&s;t I &s;hall mention, is the unavoid|able nece&s;&s;ity of death. And this is common to all the percipient beings in our world, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of them. And their &s;ubjection to death, in con&s;equence of the operation of the laws of nature, is a wi&s;er and better contrivance for the production of good, and a &s;tronger proof of the benevo|lence of the Deity, than an e&s;tabli&s;hment the rever&s;e of this.</P>
<P>As to the creatures inferior to man, in all their degrees of &s;ubordination, it is obvious, upon the &s;lighte&s;t attention, that more benevo|lence may be manife&s;ted by their &s;ucceeding one another in life, than by their continuance
<PB N="282" REF="018397_0280_0FA70C0C5A6B2B18">
in being without death. In the former of the&s;e ways of communicating life, there may be inconceivably more of it, and con&s;equent|ly more enjoyment of good, &s;o far as life is at all a ba&s;is for &s;uch enjoyment, than in the latter. There can be no rea&s;onable room for doubt as to this. Should as many &s;pecies of percipient beings, and as many individuals in each of the&s;e &s;pecies, be brought into exi&s;t|ence, as this world of our's could contain, without unavoidable inconvenience; if there was no death to make way for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in life, there would be but a very &s;mall pittance of life, in compari&s;on with what there might be, conformably to the method in which hea|ven has contrived to communicate it. Upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of no death, in the ca&s;e pro|po&s;ed, there could be no multiplication of life. It would always continue preci&s;ely the &s;ame with re&s;pect to the numbers that enjoyed it: Whereas, upon the pre&s;ent plan, there may be the continuance of every &s;pecies, with a like number of individuals, in thou&s;ands of &s;ucce&s;|&s;ions. And &s;hould a calculation be made of life multiplied in this way, it would amount to a &s;um inconceivably greater, than it could otherwi&s;e have been. Millions of animals, in every cla&s;s, are capable, in this way, of being brought into life, and made percipients of en|joyment, which mu&s;t have remained in non-en|tity, had it not been for this contrivance of death, and its being made an e&s;tabli&s;hment of
<PB N="283" REF="018397_0281_0FA70C0D12E0A440">
nature. In &s;hort, by means of the pre&s;ent &s;cheme of God, there has been, and may yet be, as much more life, and enjoyment, among the inferior ranks of animals, than there would have been, without the introduction of death, as there already have been, and may &s;till be, &s;ucce&s;&s;ions in their life; for, in every &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, there may be as much life, and enjoyment, as in the fir&s;t cla&s;s that had exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>It ought to be con&s;idered yet further here, that, had it not been for death, the law of pro|pagation &s;till continuing in force, there would not have been, long before the pre&s;ent day, room in our world for a millionth part of the animals that might be brought into exi&s;tence; yea, the increa&s;e of a very few of the cla&s;&s;es of the&s;e animals would have &s;o filled the earth, that the re&s;t mu&s;t have been &s;hut out.</P>
<P>And what has been thus &s;aid of the inferior animals is equally true, &s;hould it be applied to us men. Was it not for death, there mu&s;t have been, beyond conception, le&s;s life, and con|&s;equently enjoyment, than there has been, and &s;till may be, upon the pre&s;ent plan of nature. If we take into con&s;ideration only tho&s;e of our race, who, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations, have had exi&s;tence, there would not have been room on this earth for a thou&s;andth part of them, at one and the &s;ame time; much le&s;s would there have been a po&s;&s;ibility of this, if all that have died, before their arrival to a capacity of increa&s;ing their kind, &s;hould be taken into the number
<PB N="284" REF="018397_0282_0FA70C0D8D210DB0">
and they had all gone on multiplying to this day, conformably to the law of propagation. Perhaps, an hundred worlds, as large as this, would not have been &s;ufficiently exten&s;ive for their exi&s;tence, and comfortable &s;upport, in the way they are now provided for. In&s;tead there|fore of objecting again&s;t the benevolence of the Deity for the introduction of death into the world, we have rea&s;on rather to admire and adore that wi&s;dom of his, which has contri|ved and e&s;tabli&s;hed this effectual way for the fuller illu&s;tration of that infinite goodne&s;s, which is &s;o amiable an attribute of his nature.</P>
<P>Some, that they might keep at the utmo&s;t di&s;tance from reflecting di&s;honor on the Divine benevolence, on account of the law of death, have &s;uppo&s;ed it was in it&s;elf a matter of ne|ce&s;&s;ity, and could not have been otherwi&s;e; as the bodies of all animals, from the lowe&s;t to the highe&s;t cla&s;s of them, being compounded of heterogeneous parts, are naturally corrupti|ble, and mu&s;t unavoidably, in time, undergo that di&s;&s;olution, which is the thing meant, by death. Whether it be true, or not, that animal bodies mu&s;t have been &s;ubjected to SUCH corruptibi|lity, as that a di&s;&s;olution could not have been guarded again&s;t, and prevented, I &s;hall not di&s;pute at pre&s;ent. But thus much is unque&s;|tionably true, that the time of exi&s;tence, with|out the coming on of a di&s;&s;olution, is different in different cla&s;&s;es of the inferior animals; which cannot be accounted for, by the ope|ration
<PB N="285" REF="018397_0283_0FA70C0E9CABB8C0">
of any of the laws of nature, without recurring to that wi&s;dom of God, which &s;o formed the bodily con&s;titution of all animals, and &s;o differenced it with re&s;pect to the diffe|rent cla&s;&s;es of them, that the laws of nature &s;hould be unable, unle&s;s by accidental interfe|rance, to effect a di&s;&s;olution in any of them, but in conformity to that <HI>&s;pecial difference,</HI> as to the general time, that had been previou&s;ly alot|ted for their continuance in being.</P>
<P>And with re&s;pect to the race of men, in par|ticular, &s;o far as we may receive for truth what Mo&s;es has related, the <HI>time</HI> of their bodily di&s;|&s;olution, the &s;ame general laws of nature &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, and in operation, has been greatly varied. Men live now, generally &s;peak|ing, but &s;eventy, or eighty years: Whereas, in the Anti-Diluvian ages, they lived &s;ome hundreds of years; and they might, had God &s;o plea&s;ed, have gone on living as many thou|&s;ands: Yea, their &s;pecial con&s;titution might have been &s;uch, for aught any one can prove to the contrary, as that they &s;hould not have &s;een corruption.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to the new-te&s;tament writings, there will be no death, among the true &s;ervants of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in the re&s;urrection-world. They will have bodies there, as they have here. Their bodies may be there more refined, and with greater &s;kill organized, &s;o as to be fitter machines for the &s;oul to act by; but they will be bodies &s;till, and yet not &s;ubject to mortality. Hence that emphatically &s;trong declaration of the apo&s;tle Paul, "This corruptible mu&s;t put on incorruption, and this mortal mu&s;t put on immortality. So, when this corruptible &s;hall have put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then &s;hall be brought to pa&s;s the &s;aying that is written, "death is &s;wallowed up in victory." It is from hence evident, that material bodies may, by the &s;kill of the all-wi&s;e and all-powerful Archi|tect, be &s;o formed, as that, under his over-ruling guidance and protection, they may continue in exi&s;tence without death forever. According to the &s;ame writings al&s;o it is evident, that mankind would not have been &s;ubjected to death, had it not been for the lap&s;e of the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t man, Adam. But it is evident likewi&s;e, that it could not have been the intention of God, that Adam, together with all that might proceed from him, &s;hould have lived on this earth at one and the &s;ame time; and for this very good rea&s;on, becau&s;e it was plainly impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould. This world could not have contained and &s;ub&s;i&s;ted them; unle&s;s their bodies, and the manner of &s;upporting them, had been quite diffe|rent from what they now are. If therefore they had not died, &s;ome other way mu&s;t have been provided to make room for tho&s;e who would have been brought into being. Perhaps, in certain periods, numbers of tho&s;e who had been fitted therefor, might have been tran&s;lated to &s;ome other place of abode, to enjoy happine&s;s there, in &s;ome &s;uperior mode of exi&s;tence. But be this as it may, this non-&s;ubjection to death was not owing to a created natural incorruptibility, but to a &s;pecial promi&s;e from Almighty God, that, while innocent, they &s;hould be &s;o protected, and pre&s;erved, as not to &s;ee corruption. But, innocence being lo&s;t, the promi&s;e of immortality became vacated, and death of cour&s;e too<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> place: Only, it was left with God to fix the general period of life; which he has done with wi&s;dom that di&s;covers great goodne&s;s.</NOTE> But, in the plan of God,
<PB N="286" REF="018397_0284_0FA70C1057E78990">
it has been ordered otherwi&s;e. He has &s;o con|&s;tituted our bodily &s;tructure, that it &s;hall, with|in &s;uch a general period, naturally fall to pieces. And this general period he has fixed, not from any nece&s;&s;ity there was for it by rea&s;on of the corruptibility of the materials of which it is formed; but by &s;o contriving the continuance
<PB N="287" REF="018397_0285_0FA70C10B40FD5C8">
of one generation, as that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of another &s;hould be admirably adapted to mani|fe&s;t both wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s in providing for the exi&s;tence of mere life, and con&s;equent en|joyment, than there would otherwi&s;e have been on this earth.</P>
<P>It might al&s;o be with a view to promote morally good purpo&s;es, that the law of death, e&s;pecially as to its general time, has been e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by God. It is not ea&s;y to conceive of any motive more &s;trikingly adapted to excite to con&s;ideration, and &s;uch a behavior in life as may lay a ju&s;t foundation for calmne&s;s and &s;erenity of mind, when the time comes that we mu&s;t depart out of this into another &s;tate. And it is, mo&s;t certainly, a very powerful re|&s;traint from vicious practices, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e kinds, and degrees, which naturally tend to ha&s;ten death, and bring it on before its proper time. It is indeed one of the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t contri|vances for the government of men, and to keep them within the re&s;traints of rea&s;on and virtue. As Dr. Sherlock, in his excellent treati&s;e on death, expre&s;&s;es it, "Mortality and death are nece&s;&s;ary to the good government of the world. Nothing el&s;e can give a check to &s;ome men's wickedne&s;s, but either the fear of death, or exe|cution of it. Some men are &s;o outrageou&s;ly wicked, that nothing can put a &s;top to them, and prevent the mi&s;chief they do in the world, but to cut them off. This is the rea&s;on of ca|pital puni&s;hments among men, to remove tho&s;e
<PB N="288" REF="018397_0286_0FA70C1177CC4D40">
out of the world who will be a plague to man|kind kind while they live in it. For this rea&s;on God de&s;troyed the whole race of mankind by a deluge of water, excepting Noah, and his family, be|cau&s;e they were incurably wicked. For this rea&s;on he &s;ends plagues, and famine, and &s;word, to correct the exorbitant growth of wickedne&s;s, to le&s;&s;en the number of &s;inners, and to lay re|&s;traints on them. And if the world be &s;uch a bedlam as it is under all the&s;e re&s;traints, what would it be were it filled with immortal &s;in|ners!"</P>
<P>Upon the whole that has been &s;aid, in rela|tion to natural evil, it appears either that it could not have been prevented in &s;uch a world as our's; or, that it is mi&s;called evil, being rather the contrivance of wi&s;dom in order to the production of more good, than there other|wi&s;e would have been. It is conceded, a better world than this, more perfect, and more power|fully adapted to make happy, might be created by the Deity; but then it ought to be remem|bered, &s;uch a better world may be already one of the links in the diver&s;ified chain of exi&s;tence. The only proper que&s;tion therefore is, whether the making &s;uch a world as this, is not a proof of more benevolence, than a cha&s;m would be in that part of the creation, which it now occu|pies? If &s;o, imperfect as it is, comparatively &s;peaking, it is better it &s;hould be, than not be. And, for &s;uch an imperfect world as this ought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be, in an indefinitely variegated creation, in
<PB N="289" REF="018397_0287_0FA70C1202EAF6A8">
order to its being a proper part in the chain of exi&s;tence, no alteration, it may be, notwith&s;tand|ing all the complaints that have been made of deficiences, redundances, deformities, and evils, could be made without damage to the &s;y&s;tem. If in &s;ome things, ab&s;olutely viewed, an alter|ation for the better might be &s;uppo&s;ed, yet this very alteration, con&s;idered, as it ought to be, in its relation to other parts, which, as truly as the&s;e, go to the con&s;titution of the whole, it might turn out greatly to its di&s;ad|vantage. Arch Deacon Law, in his 42 Note, on Arch Bi&s;hop King's "origin of evil," has well expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf upon this head. Says he, "we may &s;afely conclude, that there could have been no partial alteration of this &s;y&s;tem, but for the wor&s;e, as far as we know, at lea&s;t not for the better. They who hold that there might have been a total one, that the whole &s;cheme of things might po&s;&s;ibly have been al|tered, or rever&s;ed, and that either the direct contrary, or a quite different one, would have been equally, or more worthy of God; the men, I &s;ay, that hold this, are obliged to &s;how the po&s;&s;ibility of conceiving of it, and to ex|plain the manner of how it may be, before we are obliged to believe them.&mdash;And when they have done this, and compleated their &s;y&s;tem, and made a total alteration of things, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they ima|gine, for the better, they are at la&s;t got only to the ab&s;urdity of putting this &s;y&s;tem into an higher cla&s;s; whereas, all the different cla&s;&s;es,

in every conceivable degree of perfection, were &s;uppo&s;ed to be entirely filled at the fir&s;t. We mu&s;t therefore take things as they are, and ar|gue only from the pre&s;ent nature of them, col|lectively. In which view, we &s;hall find no po&s;&s;ible alteration of any thing, but what would produce greater inconveniences, either in it&s;elf, or others, to which it bears a &s;trict relation." He goes on, taking occa&s;ion to borrow a &s;ection from Mr. Maxwell's general remarks on Cum|berland, in the&s;e words. "The nature of things, in the natural world, is &s;o exactly fitted to the natural faculties and di&s;po&s;itions of mankind, that were any thing in it otherwi&s;e than it is, even in degree, mankind would be le&s;s happy, than they now are, Thus the dependence of all natural effects upon a few &s;imple principles, is wonderfully advantageous in many re&s;pects. The degrees of all the &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ures are ex|actly &s;uited to the u&s;e of each; &s;o that if we enjoyed any of them in a greater degree we &s;hould be le&s;s happy: For our appetites of tho&s;e plea&s;ures would, by that means, be too &s;trong for our rea&s;on; and, as we are framed, tempt us to an immoderate enjoyment of them, &s;o as to prejudice our bodies. And, where we en|joy &s;ome of them in &s;o high a degree, as that, it is, in many ca&s;es, very difficult for the &s;trong|e&s;t to regulate and moderate the appetites of tho&s;e plea&s;ures, it is in &s;uch in&s;tances where it was nece&s;&s;ary to counterpoize &s;ome di&s;advanta|ges, which are the con&s;equences of the pur&s;uit

It &s;eems al&s;o probable, that the degree of our intellec|tual capacity is very well &s;uited to our objects of knowledge, and that had we a greater degree thereof, we &s;hould be le&s;s happy. Moreover, it is probably &s;o adapted to the inward frame of our bodies, that it could not be greater, without either an alteration in the laws of na|ture, or in the laws of union between the &s;oul and body. Farther; were it much greater than it is, our thoughts and pur&s;uits would be &s;o &s;piritual and refined, that we &s;hould be taken too much off from &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ures. We &s;hould probably be con&s;cious of &s;ome defects or wants in our bodily organs, and would be &s;en&s;ible that they were unequal to &s;o great a capacity, which would nece&s;&s;arily be followed by unea&s;ine&s;s of mind.

unequal union mu&s;t be attended with continual di&s;quietudes, and di&s;contents. As for our pains, they are all either warnings again&s;t bo|dily di&s;orders, or are &s;uch as, had we wanted them, the laws of nature remaining as they are, we &s;hould either have wanted &s;ome plea&s;ures we now enjoy, or have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them in a le&s;s de|gree. Tho&s;e things in nature which we cannot reconcile to the foregoing opinion, as being ig|norant of their u&s;e, we have good rea&s;on, from analogy, to believe are really advantageous, and adapted to the happine&s;s of intelligent beings of the &s;y&s;tem; though we have not &s;o full and complete a knowledge of the entire &s;y&s;tem, as to be able to point out their particularities. From the&s;e ob&s;ervations we may conclude, that all the various parts of our &s;y&s;tem are &s;o admi|rably &s;uited to one another, and the whole con|trived with &s;uch exqui&s;ite wi&s;dom, that were any thing, in any part thereof, in the lea&s;t otherwi&s;e than it is, without an alteration in the whole, there would be a le&s;s &s;um of hap|pine&s;s in the &s;y&s;tem than there now is."</P>
<P>I have now &s;aid all that I intended to &s;ay in illu&s;tration of the &s;upremely perfect benevo|lence of the Deity, as al&s;o in &s;olving the objec|tions which have been made again&s;t this attri|bute of his from the known appearances in nature. How far what I have offered, may be worthy of notice, mu&s;t be left with tho&s;e into who&s;e hands it may fall, to judge. If any &s;hould think the arguing is inconclu&s;ive, finding them|&s;elves,

at the &s;ame time, unable to reconcile the manife&s;tations of Divine goodne&s;s with the character of God, as infinitely benevolent, let them not, on this account, que&s;tion in their hearts whether he is endowed with this mo&s;t amiable perfection. For there is no way of rea|&s;oning, by which we can prove that he po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;es any perfection, but it may in the &s;ame way be proved, that he is &s;upremely benevo|lent. Nor would it be any thing &s;trange &s;hould we, who are &s;o low an order in the &s;cale of intelligent beings, be unable to remove away the&s;e difficulties that may attend, in &s;ome in&s;tances, the di&s;play of this Divine attribute. In&s;tead therefore of perplexing our own minds, or the minds of others, with &s;eeming incon&s;i&s;|tencies in God's manife&s;tations of his goodne&s;s, let us adore before him as a Being infinitely benevolent; patiently waiting for the coming day of revelation, when it &s;hall be made to appear with a meridian lo&s;tre, that nothing was ever done in the conduct of God towards our world but in harmony with wi&s;e goodne&s;s, accurate ju&s;tice, and the mo&s;t perfect con&s;i&s;tency with all tho&s;e moral qualities, which con&s;titute the ble&s;&s;ed God an infinitely amiable Being.</P>
