<P>WE, the members of the congre&s;s of the colony of New-Hamp&s;hire, cho&s;en and appointed by the free &s;uffrages of the people of &s;aid colony, and authori&s;ed and impowered by them, to meet together, and u&s;e &s;uch means, and pur&s;ue &s;uch mea&s;ures, as we &s;hall judge be&s;t for the public good; and in particular to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome form of government, provided that mea|&s;ure &s;hould be recommended by the Continental Congre&s;s; and a recommendation to that purpo&s;e having been tran&s;|mitted to us, from the &s;aid Congre&s;s; have taken into our &s;erious con&s;ideration the unhappy circum&s;tances into which this colony is involved, by means of many griev|ous and oppre&s;&s;ive acts of the Briti&s;h Parliament, de|priving

us of our native and con&s;titutional rights and pri|vileges; to enforce obedience to which acts, a powerful fleet and army have been &s;ent into this country, by the mini&s;try of Great-Britain, who have exerci&s;ed a wanton and cruel abu&s;e of their power, in de&s;troying the lives and properties of the coloni&s;ts, in many places, with fire and &s;word, taking the &s;hips and lading from many of the ho|ne&s;t and indu&s;trious inhabitants of this colony, employed in commerce, agreeable to the laws and cu&s;toms a long time u&s;ed here:</P>
<P>The &s;udden and abrupt departure of his excellency John Wentworth, e&s;q. our late governor, and &s;everal of the council, leaving us de&s;titute of legi&s;lation; and no executive courts being open to puni&s;h criminal offenders, whereby the lives and properties of the hone&s;t people of this colony, are liable to the machinations and evil de|&s;igns of wicked men:</P>
<P>Therefore, for the pre&s;ervation of peace and good order, and for the &s;ecurity of the lives and properties of the in|habitants of this colony, we conceive our&s;elves reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of e&s;tabli&s;hing a Form of Government, to continue during the pre&s;ent unhappy and unnatural con|te&s;t with Great-Britain; prote&s;ting and declaring, that we never &s;ought to throw off our dependance upon Great-Britain, but felt our&s;elves happy under her protection, while we could enjoy our con&s;titutional rights and privi|leges&mdash;and that we &s;hall rejoice, if &s;uch a reconciliation between us and our parent &s;tate can be effected, as &s;hall be approved by the Continental Congre&s;s, in who&s;e pru|dence and wi&s;dom we confide.</P>
<P>Accordingly, pur&s;uant to the tru&s;t: repo&s;ed in us, we do Re&s;olve, that this congre&s;s a&s;&s;ume the name, power, and authority of a Home of Repre&s;entatives or A&s;&s;embly, for the colony of New-Hamp&s;hire: and that &s;aid hou&s;e, then proceed to choo&s;e twelve per&s;ons, being reputable free|holders, and inhabitants within this colony, in the follow|ing manner, <HI>viz.</HI> five in the county of Rockingham, two in the county of Strafford, two in the county of Hill&s;borough, two in the county of Che&s;hire, and one in the county of

<HEAD>PREAMBLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE end of the in&s;titution, maintenance and admi|ni&s;tration of government, is to &s;ecure the exi&s;tence of the body-politic, to protect it, and to furni&s;h the in|dividuals who compo&s;e it, with the power of enjoying, in &s;afety and tranquillity, their natural right, and the ble&s;|&s;ings of life: And whenever the&s;e great objects are not obtained, the people have a right to alter the govern|ment, and to take mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;afety, pro&s;perity and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The body-politic is formed by a voluntary a&s;&s;ociation of individuals: It is a &s;ocial compact, by which the whole people covenants with each citizen, and each citizen with the whole people, that all &s;hall be governed by certain laws for the common good. It is the duty of the people, therefore, in framing a con&s;titution of government, to provide for an equitable mode of making laws, as well as for an impartial interpretation, and a faithful execution of them; that every man may, at all times, find his &s;ecurity in them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>PART I.</HI> A DECLARATION of RIGHTS, of the Inhabitants of the Commonwealth of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> I. ALL men are born free and equal, and have certain natural, e&s;&s;ential, and unalienable rights; among which may be reckoned the right of enjoy|ing and defending their lives and liberties; that of acquir|ing, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, and protecting property; in fine, that of &s;eeking and obtaining their &s;afety and happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">II. It is the right as well as the duty of all men in &s;o|ciety, publicly, and at &s;tated &s;ea&s;ons, to wor&s;hip the Su|preme Being, thd great Creator and Pre&s;erver of the Uni|ver&s;e. And no &s;ubject &s;hall be hurt, mole&s;ted, or re&s;train|ed in his per&s;on, liberty, or e&s;tate, for wor&s;hipping God in the manner and &s;ea&s;on mo&s;t agreeable to the dictates of his own con&s;cience; or for his religious profe&s;&s;ion or &s;en|timents; provided he doth not di&s;turb the public peace, or ob&s;truct others in their religious wor&s;hip.</P>
<P N="3">III. As the happine&s;s of a people, and the good order and pre&s;ervation of civil government, e&s;&s;entially depend upon piety, religion, and morality; and as the&s;e cannot be generally diffu&s;ed through a community, but by the in&s;titution of the public wor&s;hip of God, and of public
<PB N="9" REF="017390_0009_0FA111C064E52120">
in&s;tructions in piety, religion and morality: Therefore, to promote their happine&s;s, and to &s;ecure the good order and pre&s;ervation of their government, the people of this com|monwealth have a right to inve&s;t their legi&s;lature with power to authori&s;e and require, and the legi&s;lature &s;hall, from time to time, authori&s;e and require the &s;everal towns, pari&s;hes, precincts, and other bodies-politic, or religious &s;ocieties, to make &s;uitable provi&s;ion, at their own expence, for the in&s;titution of the public wor&s;hip of God, and for the &s;upport and maintenance of public prote&s;tant teachers of piety, religion, and morality, in all ca&s;es where &s;uch provi&s;ion &s;hall not be made voluntarily.</P>
<P>And the people of this commonwealth, have al&s;o a right to, and do, inve&s;t their legi&s;lature with authority to enjoin, upon all the &s;ubjects, an attendance upon the in|&s;tructions of the public teachers as afore&s;aid, at &s;tated times and &s;ea&s;ons, if there be any on who&s;e in&s;tructions they can con&s;cientiou&s;ly and conveniently attend.</P>
<P>Provided notwith&s;tanding, that the &s;everal towns, pa|ri&s;hes, precincts, and other bodies-politic, or religious &s;o|cieties, &s;hall, at all times, have the exclu&s;ive right of elec|ting their public teachers, and of contracting with them for their &s;upport and maintenance.</P>
<P>And all monies paid by the &s;ubject to the &s;upport of public wor&s;hip, and of the public teachers afore&s;aid, &s;hall, if he require it, be uniformly applied to the &s;upport of the public teacher or teachers of his own religious &s;ect or de|nomination, provided there be any on who&s;e in&s;tructions he attends; otherwi&s;e it may be paid towards the &s;upport of the teacher or teachers of the pari&s;h or precinct in which the &s;aid monies are rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>And every denomination of Chri&s;tians demeaning them|&s;elves peaceably, and as good &s;ubjects of the common|wealth, &s;hall be equally under the protection of the law: And no &s;ubordination of any one &s;ect or denomination to another, &s;hall ever be e&s;tabli&s;hed by law.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The people of this commonwealth have the &s;ole and exclu&s;ive right of governing them&s;elves as a free, &s;o|vereign, and independent &s;tate; and do, and forever here|after
<PB N="10" REF="017390_0010_0FA111C0AD99BC90" MS="y">
&s;hall, exerci&s;e and enjoy every power, juri&s;diction, and right, which is not, or may not hereafter, be by them expre&s;ly delegat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to the United States of America, in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P N="5">V. All power re&s;iding originally in the people, and be|ing derived from them, the &s;everal magi&s;trates and offi|cers of government, ve&s;ted with authority, whether legi&s;|lative, executive, or judicial, are their &s;ub&s;titutes and agents, and are at all times accountable to them.</P>
<P N="6">VI. No man, or corporation, or a&s;&s;ociation of men, have any other title to obtain advantages, or particular and exclu&s;ive privileges, di&s;tinct from tho&s;e of the com|munity, than what ari&s;es from the con&s;ideration of &s;ervices rendered to the public; and this title being in nature nei|ther hereditary nor tran&s;mi&s;&s;ible to children, or de&s;cend|ents, or relations by blood, the idea of a man born a ma|gi&s;trate, lawgiver, or judge, is ab&s;urd and unnatural.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Government is in&s;tituted for the common good; for the protection, &s;afety, pro&s;perity, and happine&s;s of the people; and not for the profit, honour, or private inte|re&s;t of any one man, family, or cla&s;s of men: Therefore, the people alone have an inconte&s;tible, unalienable, and indefea&s;ible right, to in&s;titute government; and to reform, alter, or totally change the &s;ame, when their protection, &s;afety, pro&s;perity, and happine&s;s require it.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. In order to prevent tho&s;e, who are ve&s;ted with authority from becoming oppre&s;&s;ors, the people have a right, at &s;uch periods, and in &s;uch manner as they &s;hall e&s;tabli&s;h by their frame of government, to cau&s;e their pub|lic officers to return to private life; and to fill up vacant places, by certain and regular elections and appointments.</P>
<P N="9">IX. All elections ought to be free, and all the inhabi|tants of this commonwealth, having &s;uch qualifications as they &s;hall e&s;tabli&s;h by their frame of government, have an equal right to elect officers, and to be elected for public employments.</P>
<P N="10">X. Each individual of the &s;ociety has a right to be pro|tected by it, in the enjoyment of his life, liberty, and property, according to &s;tanding laws. He is obliged,
<PB N="11" REF="017390_0011_0FA111C1E047B7B8">
con&s;equently, to contribute his &s;hare to the expence of this protection; to give his per&s;onal &s;ervice, or an equiva|lent, when nece&s;&s;ary: But no part of the property of any individual, can, with ju&s;tice, be taken from him, or ap|plied to public u&s;es, without his own con&s;ent, or that of the repre&s;entative body of the people: In fine, the peo|ple of this commonwealth are not controulable by any other laws, than tho&s;e to which their con&s;titutional repre|&s;entative body have given their con&s;ent. And whenever the public exigences require, that the property of any in|dividual &s;hould be appropriated to public u&s;es, he &s;hall receive a rea&s;onable compen&s;ation therefor.</P>
<P N="11">XI. Every &s;ubject of the commonwealth ought to find a certain remedy, by having recour&s;e to the laws for all in|juries or wrongs which he may receive in his per&s;on, property or character. He ought to obtain right and ju&s;tice freely, and without being obliged to purcha&s;e it; compleatly, and without any denial; promptly, and with|out delay; conformably to the laws.</P>
<P N="12">XII. No &s;ubject &s;hall be held to an&s;wer for any crime or offence, until the &s;ame is fully and plainly, &s;ub&s;tanti|ally and formally, de&s;cribed to him; or be compelled to accu&s;e, or furni&s;h evidence again&s;t him&s;elf. And every &s;ubject &s;hall have a right to produce all proofs that may be favourable to him; to meet the witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him face to face, and to be fully heard in his defence by him|&s;elf, or his council, at his election. And no &s;ubject &s;hall be arre&s;ted, impri&s;oned, de&s;poiled, or deprived of his property, immunities, or privileges, put out of the pro|tection of the law, exiled, or deprived of his life, liberty, or e&s;tate, but by the judgment of his peers, or the law of the land.</P>
<P>And the legi&s;lature &s;hall not make any law, that &s;hall &s;ubject any per&s;on to a capital or infamous puni&s;hment, excepting for the government of the army and navy, with|out trial by jury.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. In criminal pro&s;ecutions, the verification of facts in the vicinity where they happen, is one of the greate&s;t &s;ecurities of the life, liberty, and property of the citizen.</P>
<P N="14"><PB N="12" REF="017390_0012_0FA111C20A6C0F70">XIV. Every &s;ubject has a right to be &s;ecure from all unrea|&s;onable &s;earches, and &s;eizures, of his per&s;on, his hou&s;es, his papers, and all his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. All warrants, therefore, are contrary to this right, if the cau&s;e or foundation of them be not previou&s;ly &s;upported by oath or affirmation; and if the order in a warrant to a civil officer, to make &s;earch in all &s;u&s;pected places, or to arre&s;t one or more &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons, or to &s;eize their property, be not ac|companied with a &s;pecial de&s;ignation of the per&s;ons or ob|jects of &s;earch, arre&s;t, or &s;eizure; and no warrant ought to be i&s;&s;ued, but in ca&s;es and with the formalities pre|&s;cribed by the laws.</P>
<P N="15">XV. In all controver&s;ies concerning property, and in all &s;uits between two or more per&s;ons, except in ca&s;es in which it has heretofore been otherways u&s;ed and prac|ti&s;ed, the parties have a right to a trial by a jury; and this method of procedure &s;hall be held &s;acred, unle&s;s, in cau&s;es ari&s;ing on the high &s;eas, and &s;uch as relate to mariners wages, the legi&s;lature &s;hall hereafter find it nece&s;&s;ary to alter it.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. The liberty of the pre&s;s is e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ecuri|ty of freedom in a &s;tate; it ought not, therefore, to be re&s;trained in this commonwealth.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. The people have a right to keep and to bear arms for the common defence. And as in time of peace armies are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be maintained without the con&s;ent of the legi&s;lature, and the military power &s;hall always be held in exact &s;ubordina|tion to the civil authority, and be governed by it.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. A frequent recurrence to the fundamental prin|ciples of the con&s;titution, and a con&s;tant adherence to tho&s;e of piety, ju&s;tice, moderation, temperance, indu&s;try, and frugality, are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to pre&s;erve the ad|vantages of liberty, and to maintain a free government. The people ought, con&s;equently, to have a particular at|tention to all tho&s;e principles, in the choice of their offi|cers and repre&s;entatives: And they have a right to require of their lawgivers and magi&s;trates, an exact and con&s;tant ob&s;ervance of them, in the formation and execution of all
<PB N="13" REF="017390_0013_0FA111C2CB0F7778">
laws nece&s;&s;ary for the good admini&s;tration of the common|wealth.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. The people have a right, in an orderly and peaceable manner, to a&s;&s;emble to con&s;ult upon the com|mon good; give in&s;tructions to their repre&s;entatives; and to reque&s;t of the legi&s;lative body, by the way of addre&s;&s;es, petitions, or remon&s;trances, redre&s;s of the wrongs done them, and of the grievances they &s;uffer.</P>
<P N="20">XX. The power of &s;u&s;pending the laws, or the exe|cution of the laws, ought never to be exerci&s;ed but by the legi&s;lature, or by authority derived from it, to be exerci&s;ed in &s;uch particular ca&s;es only as the legi&s;lature &s;hall expre&s;|ly provide for.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. The freedom of deliberation, &s;peech, and de|bate, in either hou&s;e of the legi&s;lature, is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the rights of the people, that it cannot be the foundation of any accu&s;ation or pro&s;ecution, action, or complaint, in any other court or place what&s;oever.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. The legi&s;lature ought frequently to a&s;&s;emble for the redre&s;s of grievances, for correcting, &s;trengthening, and confirming the laws, and for making new laws, as the common good may require.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. No &s;ub&s;idy, charge, tax, impo&s;t, or duties, ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, fixed, laid, or levied, under any pretext what&s;oever, without the con&s;ent of the people, or their repre&s;entatives in the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P N="24">XXIV. Laws made to puni&s;h for actions done before the exi&s;tence of &s;uch laws, and which have not been de|clared crimes by preceding laws, are unju&s;t, oppre&s;&s;ive, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the fundamental principles of a free government.</P>
<P N="15">XXV. No &s;ubject ought, in any ca&s;e, or in any time, to be declared guilty of trea&s;on or felony by the legi&s;la|ture.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI. No magi&s;trate or court of law &s;hall demand exce&s;&s;ive bail or &s;ureties, impo&s;e exce&s;&s;ive fines, or inflict cruel or unu&s;ual puni&s;hments.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. In time of peace, no &s;oldier ought to be quar|tered in any hou&s;e without the con&s;ent of the owner; and
<PB N="14" REF="017390_0014_0FA111C3898DDCA0">
in time of war, &s;uch quarters ought not to be made, but by the civil magi&s;trate, in a manner ordained by the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. No per&s;on can in any ca&s;e be &s;ubjected to law-martial, or to any penalties or pains, by virtue of that law, except tho&s;e employed in the army or navy, and except the militia in actual &s;ervice, but by authority of the legi&s;|lature.</P>
<P N="29">XXIX. It is e&s;&s;ential to the pre&s;ervation of the rights of every individual, his life, liberty, property, and character, that there be an impartial interpretation of the laws, and ad|mini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. It is the right of every citizen to be tried by judges as free, impartial, and independent, as the lot of humanity will admit. It is, therefore, not only the be&s;t policy, but for the &s;ecurity of the rights of the people, and of every citizen, that the judges of the &s;upreme judicial court &s;hould hold their offices as long as they behave them&s;elves well; and that they &s;hould have honourable &s;a|laries, a&s;certained and e&s;tabli&s;hed by &s;tanding laws.</P>
<P N="30">XXX.

<P>Per Ip&s;um Regem.</P>
<P>[Since the commencement of ho&s;tilities by Great Bri|tain, the &s;tate of Rhode-I&s;land and Providence plantations has not a&s;&s;umed a form of government different from that contained in the foregoing charter. For in that, the king ceded to the governor and company, all powers, legi&s;la|tive, executive, and judicial, re&s;erving to him&s;elf, as an acknowledgement of his &s;overeignty, a render of the fifth part of the gold and &s;ilver ore that &s;hould be found with|in the territory. The governor, chief magi&s;trates, and legi&s;lators are cho&s;en by the freemen as u&s;ual, and all ju|dicial and executive officers are annually elected by the governor and company, or upper and lower hou&s;e of a&s;|&s;embly. All proce&s;&s;es original and judicial, formerly i&s;|&s;ued in the king's name, but they now i&s;&s;ue in the name of the governor and company. The oaths of allegiance and of office are made conformable to the principles of the revolution. The governor, in his legi&s;lative capacity, can|not give a negative to any act of the two hou&s;es; but, in common with the other magi&s;trates, has one voice only.</P>
<P>The &s;tate is divided into five counties, in each of which there is a court of common pleas and general &s;e&s;&s;ions of the peace, held twice every year, for the trial of all cau&s;es not capital, that ari&s;e within their limits; from which an appeal lies, to the &s;uperior court of judicature, court of a&s;&s;ize and general jail delivery, who&s;e juri&s;diction extends over the whole &s;tate, and who al&s;o &s;it twice a year in each county. The con&s;titution admits not of religious e&s;tabli&s;hments, any farther than depends upon the voluntary choice of individu|als. All men profe&s;&s;ing one Supreme Being, are equally protected by the laws, and no particular &s;ect can claim pre|eminence: From hence it is, that benevolence, ho&s;pitality, and undi&s;&s;embled hone&s;ty remarkably characteri&s;e the people.]</P>

<HEAD>CONNECTICUT. <HI>ACCOUNT</HI> of the <HI>CONSTITUTION</HI> of <HI>CONNECTICUT.</HI></HEAD>
<P>CONNECTICUT is divided into &s;ix counties, and each county is divided into a number of towns. Each town has a right to &s;end two repre&s;entatives to the gene|ral court or a&s;&s;embly. The general court con&s;i&s;ts of two branches called the upper and lower hou&s;e. The upper hou&s;e is compo&s;ed of the governor, deputy-governor, and twelve a&s;&s;i&s;tants or coun&s;ellors; and the lower hou&s;e of the repre&s;entatives of the &s;everal towns. This court has the &s;ole power to make and repeal laws, grant levies, di&s;|po&s;e of lands belonging to the &s;tate, to particular towns and per&s;ons: to erect and &s;tile judicatories and officers, as they &s;hall &s;ee nece&s;&s;ary for the good government of the people; and al&s;o to call to account any court, magi&s;trate, or other officer, for any mi&s;demeanor or mal-admini&s;tra|tion, and for ju&s;t cau&s;e may fine, di&s;place, or remove them, or deal otherwi&s;e, as the nature of the ca&s;e &s;hall require; and deal or act in any other matter that concerns the good of the &s;tate, except the election of governor, deputy-go|vernor, a&s;&s;i&s;tants, trea&s;urer, and &s;ecretary, which &s;hall be done by the freemen at the yearly court of election, un|le&s;s there be any vacancy by rea&s;on of death or other|wi&s;e, after the election, which may be filled up by the general court. This court has power al&s;o, for rea&s;ons &s;atisfactory to them, to grant &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, relea&s;e, and jail delivery upon reprieve, in capital and criminal ca&s;es. The general court has two &s;tated &s;e&s;&s;ions annually, on the &s;econd Thur&s;days of May and October.</P>
<P>The governor, or in his ab&s;ence the deputy-governor, may call the a&s;&s;embly, on &s;pecial emergencies, to meet
<PB N="60" REF="017390_0060_0FA111FAC1921D68">
at any other time. The governor, deputy-governor, a&s;|&s;i&s;tants, and &s;ecretary, are annually elected on the &s;econd Thur&s;day in May. The repre&s;entatives are newly cho|&s;en for each &s;tated &s;e&s;&s;ion. The judges and ju&s;tices are annually appointed by the general court; the &s;ame per|&s;ons are commonly re-appointed from time to time during their capacity to &s;erve, unle&s;s guilty of mi&s;behaviour. The &s;heriffs are appointed by the governor and council, with|out limitation of time, but may be &s;uper&s;eded by the au|thority that appoints them. The governor for the time being is captain general of the militia; the deputy-gover|nor, lieutenant-general; the other general officers, and the held officers are appointed by the general court, and commi&s;&s;ioned by the governor. The captains and &s;ub|alterns are cho&s;en by the vote of the company and hou&s;|holders li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ng within the limits of the company; the per&s;on &s;o cho&s;en mu&s;t be approved by the general court, and commi&s;&s;ioned by the governor, before they have power to execute their offices. All the military officers hold their offices during the plea&s;ure of the a&s;&s;embly, nor can they re&s;ign their commi&s;&s;ions without leave of the captain-general, under penalty of doing duty in the ranks as private &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>The mode of electing the governor, deputy-governor, a&s;&s;i&s;tants, trea&s;urer, and &s;ecretary is, that the freemen in the &s;everal towns meet on the Monday next after the fir&s;t Tue&s;day in April annually (being the day appointed by law for that purpo&s;e, and choo&s;ing repre&s;entatives) and give in their votes for the per&s;ons they choo&s;e for &s;aid of|fices re&s;pectively, with their names written on a piece of paper, which votes are received and &s;ealed up by a con|&s;table in the freemen's meeting; the votes for each of &s;aid offices in a different paper, writing on the out&s;ide the name of the town, and the office for which the votes are given in, which are &s;ent by the repre&s;entativss to the ge|neral court, to be held on the &s;econd Thur&s;day of May next en&s;uing; at which time, after the hou&s;e of repre|&s;entatives have cho&s;en a &s;peaker and clerk, a committee is cho&s;en of members of both hou&s;es, to &s;ort and count the
<PB N="61" REF="017390_0061_0FA111FB08536C88">
votes, and declare the names of the per&s;ons cho&s;en to &s;aid offices. Any freemen qualified to vote for repre&s;entatives, &amp;c. may be elected to any office in the government. In choo&s;ing a&s;&s;i&s;tants twenty per&s;ons are nominated by the votes of the freemen, given in at their meeting for choo&s;|ing repre&s;entatives in September annually, and &s;ealed up and &s;ent to the general court in October then next, which are counted by a committee of both hou&s;es, and the twenty per&s;ons who have the greate&s;t number of votes &s;tand in nomination, out of which number twelve are to be cho&s;en a&s;&s;i&s;tants by the freemen, the next April, in man|ner afore de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The qualifications requi&s;ite to entitle a per&s;on to vote in election of the officers of government are, maturity in years, quiet and peaceable behaviour, a civil conver&s;ation, and forty &s;hillings freehold, or forty pounds per&s;onal e&s;tate; if the &s;electmen of the town certify a per&s;on qualified in tho&s;e re&s;pects, he is admitted a freemen, on his taking an oath of fidelity to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The names of all that are thus admitted, are inrolled in the town-clerk's office, and continue freemen during life, unle&s;s disfranchi&s;ed by a &s;entence of the &s;uperior court on conviction of a mi&s;demeanour.</P>
<P>The governor or in his ab&s;ence the deputy governor in the upper hou&s;e, and the &s;peaker in the lower hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly, have a ca&s;ting voice when the members of the re&s;pective hou&s;es, including the governor and &s;peaker, are equally divided in opinion on any que&s;tion.</P>
<P>There is in this &s;tate a &s;uperior court, con&s;i&s;ting of one chief judge and four other judges, which have authority in all criminal ca&s;es, extending to life, limb, and bani&s;h|ment, and to hear and determine all civil actions brought by appeal from the county courts, or on writs of error. This court al&s;o hath authority in all matters of divorce. There are two &s;tated &s;e&s;&s;ions of the &s;uperior court in each county annually.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o county courts held in the &s;everal coun|ties, con&s;i&s;ting of one judge and four ju&s;tices of the quo|rum, who have juri&s;diction in all criminal ca&s;es, ari&s;ing
<PB N="62" REF="017390_0062_0FA111FBD9B09190">
within their re&s;pective counties, where the puni&s;hment does not extend to life, limb, or bani&s;hment. The coun|ty courts al&s;o have original juri&s;diction in all civil actions wherein the demand exceeds forty &s;hillings.</P>
<P>The &s;uperior and county courts try matters of fact by a jury, according to the cour&s;e of the common law.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tices of the peace have authority to hear and deter|mine civil actions where the demand does not exceed forty &s;hillings. They al&s;o have authority in &s;ome ca&s;es of a cri|minal nature, puni&s;hable by fine not exceeding forty &s;hil|lings, or whipping not exceeding ten &s;tripes, or &s;itting in the &s;tocks.</P>
<P>This &s;tate is al&s;o divided into a number of probate di&s;|tricts, le&s;s than counties; in each of which is appointed a judge for the probate of wills, granting admini&s;tration on inte&s;tate e&s;tates, appointing guardians for minors, or|dering di&s;tribution of inte&s;tate e&s;tates, &amp;c. An appeal lies from any decree of this court to the &s;uperior court.</P>
<P>The &s;uperior, county, and probate courts appoint their re&s;pective clerks.</P>
<P>The general court has till very lately been the only court of chancery in this &s;tate. But by a late law, the county courts determine matters of equity from five pounds to two hundred pounds value; the &s;uperior court from two hundred to eight hundred pounds value; and the ge|neral a&s;&s;embly all ca&s;es exceeding the la&s;t mentioned &s;um.</P>
<P>All attornies at law are admitted and &s;worn by the county courts; there is no attorney general, but there u&s;ed to be one king's attorney in each county, but &s;ince the king has abdicated the government, they are now at|tornies to the governor and company.</P>

<P N="3">3. That the people of this &s;tate have the &s;ole, exclu&s;ive, and inherent right of governing and regulating the internal police of the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="4">4. That all power being originally inherent in, and con|&s;equently derived from, the people; therefore all officers of government, whether legi&s;lative or executive, are their tru&s;tees and &s;ervants, and at all times accountable to them.</P>
<P N="5">5. That government is, or ought to be, in&s;tituted for the common benefit, protection, and &s;ecurity of the people, nation, or community; and not for the particular emolu|ment or advantage of any &s;ingle man, family, or &s;et of men, who are a part only of that community: And that the community hath an undubitable, inalienable, and inde|fea&s;ible

right to reform, alter, or aboli&s;h government in &s;uch manner, as &s;hall be by that community judged mo&s;t condu|cive to the public weal.</P>

<P N="7">7. That all elections ought to be free; and that all free men having a &s;ufficient evident common intere&s;t with, and attachment to the community, have a right to elect officers, or be elected into office.</P>
<P N="8">8.

<P N="10">10. That the people have a right to hold them&s;elves their hou&s;es, papers, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions free from &s;earch or &s;eizure; and therefore warrants without oaths or affirmations fir&s;t made, affording a &s;ufficient foundation for them, and where|by

<P N="12">12. That the people have a right to freedom of &s;peech, and of writing, and publi&s;hing their &s;entiments; therefore the freedom of the pre&s;s ought not to be re&s;trained.</P>
<P N="13">13. That the people have a right to bear arms for the de|fence of them&s;elves and the &s;tate; and as &s;tanding armies in the time of peace, are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up: And that the military &s;hould be kept under &s;trict &s;ubordination to, and governed by, the civil power.</P>
<P N="14">14. That a frequent recurrence to fundamental princi|ples, and a firm adherence to ju&s;tice, moderation, tempe|rance indu&s;try, and frugality, are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty, and keep a government free: The people ought therefore to pay particular attention to the&s;e points in the choice of officers and repre&s;entatives, and have a right to exact a due and con&s;tant regard to them, from their legi&s;lators and magi&s;trates, in the making and executing &s;uch laws as are nece&s;&s;ary for the good government of the &s;tate.</P>
<P N="15">15. That all men have a natural inherent right to emi|grate from one &s;tate to another that will receive them, or to form a new &s;tate in vacant countries, or in &s;uch coun|tries as they can purcha&s;e, whenever they think that there|by they may promote their own happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="16">16. That the people have a right to a&s;&s;emble together, to con&s;ult for their common good, to in&s;truct their repre|&s;entatives, and to apply to the legi&s;lature for redre&s;s of griev|ances, by addre&s;s, petition, or remon&s;trance.</P>

<HEAD>A DECLARATION of RIGHTS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE parliament of Great-Britain, by a declaratory act, having a&s;&s;umed a right to make laws to bind the co|lonies in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, and in pur&s;uance of &s;uch claim endeavoured by force of arms to &s;ubjugate the united colonies to an unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their will and power, and having at length con&s;trained them to declare them&s;elves in|dependent &s;tates, and to a&s;&s;ume government under the au|thority of the people. Therefore, we, the delegates of Maryland, in free and full convention a&s;&s;embled, taking into our mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration the be&s;t means of e&s;ta|bli&s;hing a good con&s;titution in this &s;tate, for the &s;ure foun|dation and more permanent &s;ecurity thereof, declare,</P>
<P N="1">1. That all government of right originates from the peo|ple, is founded in compact only, and in&s;tituted &s;olely for the good of the whole.</P>
<P N="2">2 That the people of this &s;tate ought to have the &s;ole and exclu&s;ive right of regulating the internal government and po|lice thereof.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the inhabitants of Maryland are entitled to the common law of England, and the trial by jury, according to the cour&s;e of that law, and to the benefit of &s;uch of the Engli&s;h &s;tatutes, as exi&s;ted at the time of their fir&s;t emigra|tion, and which by experience have been found applicable
<PB N="117" REF="017390_0117_0FA1113E06B3FCF8">
to their local and other circum&s;tances, and of &s;uch others as have been &s;ince made in England, or Great-Britain, and have been introduced, u&s;ed, and practi&s;ed, by the courts of law or equity; and al&s;o to all acts of a&s;&s;embly in force on the fir&s;t of June &s;eventeen hundred and &s;eventy-four, ex|cept &s;uch as may have &s;ince expired, or have been, or may be altered by acts of convention, or this declaration of rights, &s;ubject neverthele&s;s to the revi&s;ion of, and amendment or re|peal by, the legi&s;lature of this &s;tate; and the inhabitants of Maryland are al&s;o entitled to all property derived to them from or under the charter granted by his maje&s;ty Charles I. to Caecilius Calvert, baron of Baltimore.</P>
<P N="4">4. That all per&s;ons inve&s;ted with the legi&s;lative or exe|cutive powers of government are the tru&s;tees of the public, and as &s;uch accountable for their conduct: wherefore, when|ever the ends of government are perverted, and public li|berty manife&s;tly endangered, and all other means of redre&s;s are ineffectual, the people may, and of right ought, to re|form the old or e&s;tabli&s;h a new government; the doctrine of non-re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t arbitrary power and oppre&s;&s;ion, is ab&s;urd, &s;lavi&s;h, and de&s;tructive of the good and happine&s;s of mankind.</P>
<P N="5">5. That the right in the people to participate in the legi&s;|lature is the be&s;t &s;ecurity of liberty, and the foundation of all free government; for this purpo&s;e, elections ought to be free and frequent, and every man having property in, a common intere&s;t with, and attachment to the community, ought to have a right of &s;uffrage.</P>
<P N="6">6. That the legi&s;lative, executive, and judicial powers of government, ought to be forever &s;eparate and di&s;tinct from each other.</P>
<P N="7">7. That no power of &s;u&s;pending laws, or the execution of laws, unle&s;s by, or derived from the legi&s;lature, ought to be exerci&s;ed or allowed.</P>
<P N="8">8. That freedom of &s;peech and debates, or proceedings in the legi&s;lature, ought not to be impeached in any other court or judicature.</P>
<P N="9">9. That a place for the meeting of the legi&s;lature ought to be fixed, the mo&s;t convenient to the members thereof,
<PB N="118" REF="017390_0118_0FA1113EC6ECB098">
and to the depo&s;itory of public records, and the legi&s;lature ought not to be convened or held at any other place, but from evident nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P N="10">10. That for redre&s;s of grievances, and for amending, &s;trengthening and pre&s;erving the laws, the legi&s;lature ought to be frequently convened.</P>
<P N="11">11. That every man hath a right to petition the legi&s;la|ture for the redre&s;s of grievances, in a peaceable and order|ly manner.</P>
<P N="12">12. That no aid, charge, tax, fee or fees, ought to be &s;et, rated, or levied, under any pretence, without con&s;ent of the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P N="13">13. That the levying taxes by the poll is grievous and oppre&s;&s;ive, and ought to be aboli&s;hed; that paupers ought not to be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed for the &s;upport of government, but every other per&s;on in the &s;tate ought to contribute his pro|portion of public taxes for the &s;upport of government, ac|cording to his actual worth in real or per&s;onal property with|in the &s;tate; yet fines, duties, or taxes, may properly and ju&s;tly be impo&s;ed or laid with a political view for the good government and benefit of the community.</P>
<P N="14">14. That &s;anguinary laws ought to be avoided, as far as is con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;afety of the &s;tate; and no law to in|flict cruel and unu&s;ual pains and penalties ought to be made in any ca&s;e, or at any time hereafter.</P>
<P N="15">15. That retro&s;pective laws, puni&s;hing facts committed before the exi&s;tence of &s;uch laws, and by them only declared criminal, are oppre&s;&s;ive, unju&s;t, and incompatible with liber|ty, wherefore no <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> law ought to be made.</P>
<P N="16">16. That no law to attaint particular per&s;ons of trea&s;on or felony ought to be made in any ca&s;e, or any time here|after.</P>
<P N="17">17. That every freeman, for any injury done him in his per&s;on or property, ought to have remedy by the cour&s;e of the law of the land, and ought to have ju&s;tice and right, freely without &s;ale, fully without any denial, and &s;peedily without delay, according to the law of the land.</P>
<P N="18">18. That the trial of facts where they ari&s;e, is one of the
<PB N="119" REF="017390_0119_0FA1113F87312408">
greate&s;t &s;ecurities of the lives, liberties, and e&s;tates of the people.</P>
<P N="19">19. That in all criminal pro&s;ecutions, every man hath a right to be informed of the accu&s;ation again&s;t him, to have a copy of the indictment or charge in due time (if required) to prepare for his defence, to be allowed coun&s;el, to be con|fronted with the witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him, to have proce&s;s for his witne&s;&s;es, to examine the witne&s;&s;es for and again&s;t him on oath, and to a &s;peedy trial by an impartial jury, without who&s;e unanimous con&s;ent he ought not to be found guilty.</P>
<P N="20">20. That no man ought to be compelled to give evidence again&s;t him&s;elf in a common court of law, or in any other court, but in &s;uch ca&s;es as have been u&s;ually practi&s;ed in this &s;tate, or may hereafter be directed by the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P N="21">21. That no freeman ought to be taken or impri&s;oned, or di&s;&s;ei&s;ed of his freehold, liberties, or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any manner de&s;troyed, or deprived of his life, liberty, or property, but by the judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land.</P>
<P N="22">22. That exce&s;&s;ive bail ought not to be required, nor exce&s;&s;ive fines impo&s;ed, nor cruel or unu&s;ual puni&s;hments inflicted by the courts of law.</P>
<P N="23">23. That all warrants without oath or affirmation, to &s;earch &s;u&s;pected places, or to &s;eize any per&s;on or property, are grievous and oppre&s;&s;ive; and all general warrants to &s;earch &s;u&s;pected places, or to apprehend &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons, without naming or de&s;cribing the place, or the per&s;on in &s;pe|cial, are illegal, and ought not to be granted.</P>
<P N="24">24. That there ought to be no forfeiture of any part of the e&s;tate of any per&s;on for any crime, except murder, or trea&s;on again&s;t the &s;tate, and then only on conviction and attainder.</P>
<P N="25">25. That a well regulated militia is the proper and natu|ral defence of a free government.</P>
<P N="26">26. That &s;tanding armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be rai&s;ed or kept up without con&s;ent of the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P N="27">27. That in all ca&s;es and at all times the military ought
<PB N="120" REF="017390_0120_0FA11140461FA468">
to be under &s;trict &s;ubordination to, and controul of the civil power.</P>
<P N="28">28. That no &s;oldier ought to be quartered in any hou&s;e in time of peace, without the con&s;ent of the owner; and in time of war, in &s;uch manner only as the legi&s;lature &s;hall direct.</P>
<P N="29">29. That no per&s;on, except regular &s;oldiers, mariners, and marines in the &s;ervice of this &s;tate, or militia when in actual &s;ervice, ought in any ca&s;e to be &s;ubject to, or puni&s;h|able by, martial law.</P>
<P N="30">30. That the independency and uprightne&s;s of judges are e&s;&s;ential to the impartial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, and a great &s;ecurity to the rights and liberties of the people; where|fore the chancellor and judges ought to hold commi&s;&s;ions during good behaviour, and the &s;aid chancellor and judges &s;hall be removed for mi&s;behaviour, on conviction in a court of law, and may be removed by the governor upon the addre&s;s of the general a&s;&s;embly, provided that two thirds of all the members of each hou&s;e concur in &s;uch addre&s;s. That &s;alaries liberal but not profu&s;e ought to be &s;ecured to the chancellor and the judges during the continuance of their commi&s;&s;ions, in &s;uch manner and at &s;uch times as the le|gi&s;lature &s;hall hereafter direct, upon con&s;ideration of the circum&s;tances of this &s;tate: No chancellor or judge ought to hold any other office, civil or military, or receive fees or perqui&s;ites of any kind.</P>
<P N="31">31. That a long continuance in the fir&s;t executive depart|ments of power or tru&s;t is dangerous to liberty, a rotation therefore in tho&s;e departments is one of the be&s;t &s;ecurities of permanent freedom.</P>
<P N="32">32. That no per&s;on ought to hold at the &s;ame time more than one office of profit, nor ought any per&s;on in public tru&s;t to receive any pre&s;ent from any foreign prince or &s;tate, or from the united &s;tates, or any of them, without the ap|probation of this &s;tate.</P>
<P N="33">33. That as it is the duty of every man to wor&s;hip God in &s;uch manner as he thinks mo&s;t acceptable to him, all per&s;ons profe&s;&s;ing the chri&s;tian religion are equally entitled to protection in their religious liberty; wherefore no per&s;on

<P>WHEREAS the conduct of the legi&s;lature of Great-Britain for many years pa&s;t, has been &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive on the people of America, that of late years, they have plainly declared, and a&s;&s;erted a right to rai&s;e taxes upon the people of America, and to make laws to bind them in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, without their con&s;ent; which con|duct being repugnant to the common rights of mankind, hath obliged the Americans, as freemen to oppo&s;e &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures, and to a&s;&s;ert the rights and privileges they are intitled to, by the laws of nature and rea&s;on; and accordingly it hath been done by the general con&s;ent of all the people of the &s;tates of New-Hamp&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, Rhode-I&s;land, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jer&s;ey, Penn&s;ylvania, the counties of Newca&s;tle, Kent, and Su&s;|&s;ex on Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina, and Georgia, given by their repre&s;enta|tives met together in general congre&s;s in the city of Phila|delphia.</P>
<P>And whereas it hath been recommended by the &s;aid Con|gre&s;s on the fifteenth of May la&s;t, to the re&s;pective a&s;&s;em|blies and conventions of the united &s;tates, where no go|vernment, &s;ufficient to the exigencies of their affairs, hath been hitherto e&s;tabli&s;hed, to adopt &s;uch government, as may, in the opinion of the repre&s;entatives of the people,

be&s;t conduce to the happine&s;s and &s;afety of their con&s;titu|ents in particular, and America in general.</P>
<P>And whereas the independence of the united &s;tates of America has been al&s;o declared, on the fourth day of July, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;eventy-&s;ix, by the &s;aid honourable congre&s;s, and all political connection between them and the crown of Great-Britain, is in con&s;equence thereof di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>We, therefore, the repre&s;entatives of the people, from whom all power originates, and for who&s;e benefit all go|vernment is intended, by virtue of the power delegated to us, do ordain and declare, and it is hereby ordained and declared, that the following rules and regulations be adopted for the future government of this &s;tate.</P>

<HEAD><HI>IN</HI> CONGRESS, <HI>JULY 4, 1776. A DECLARATION</HI> By the <HI>Repre&s;entatives</HI> of the <HI>UNITED STATES</HI> of <HI>AMERICA,</HI> in <HI>CONGRESS</HI> a&s;&s;embled.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN, in the cour&s;e of human events, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary for one people to di&s;&s;olve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to a&s;&s;ume among the powers of the earth, the &s;eparate and equal &s;tation to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them; a decent re&s;pect to the opinions of man|kind requires that they &s;hould declare the cau&s;es which im|pel them to the &s;eparation.</P>
<P>We hold the&s;e truths to be &s;elf evident; that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among the&s;e are life, liberty, and the pur&s;uit of happine&s;s. That to &s;ecure the&s;e rights, go|vernments are in&s;tituted among men, deriving their ju&s;t pow|ers from the con&s;ent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes de&s;tructive of the&s;e ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to aboli&s;h it, and to in&s;ti|tute new government, laying its foundation on &s;uch princi|ples, and organizing its powers in &s;uch form, as to them &s;hall &s;eem mo&s;t likely to effect their &s;afety and happine&s;s. Pru|dence, indeed, will dictate that governments long e&s;ta|bli&s;hed &s;hould not be changed for light and tran&s;ient cau&s;es; and accordingly all experience hath &s;hewn, that mankind
<PB N="188" REF="017390_0188_0FA1118A916E18E0">
are more di&s;po&s;ed to &s;uffer, while evils are &s;ufferable, than to right them&s;elves by aboli&s;hing the forms to which they are accu&s;tomed. But when along train of abu&s;es and u&s;urpa|tions, pur&s;uing invariably the &s;ame object, evinces a de&s;ign to reduce them under ab&s;olute de&s;poti&s;m, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off &s;uch government and to provide new guards for their future &s;ecurity. Such has been the pa|tient &s;ufferance of the&s;e colonies; and &s;uch is now the nece&s;&s;ity which con&s;trains them to alter their former &s;y&s;tems of govern|ment. The hi&s;tory of the pre&s;ent king of Great-Britain is a hi&s;tory of repeated injuries and u&s;urpations, all having in di|rect object the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an ab&s;olute tyranny over the&s;e &s;tates. To prove this, let facts be &s;ubmitted to a can|did world.</P>
<P>He has refu&s;ed his a&s;&s;ent to laws, the mo&s;t whole&s;ome and nece&s;&s;ary for the public good.</P>
<P>He has forbidden his governors to pa&s;s laws of immediate and pre&s;&s;ing importance, unle&s;s &s;u&s;pended in their operati|on till his a&s;&s;ent &s;hould be obtained; and when &s;o &s;u&s;pended he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</P>
<P>He has refu&s;ed to pa&s;s other laws for the accomodation of large di&s;tricts of people, unle&s;s tho&s;e people would relinqui&s;h the right of repre&s;entation in the legi&s;lature, a right ine&s;ti|mable to them, and formidable to tyrants only.</P>
<P>He has called together legi&s;lative bodies at places unu&s;ual, uncomfortable, and di&s;tant from the depo&s;itory of their pub|lic records, for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of fatiguing them into com|pliance with his mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>He has di&s;&s;olved repre&s;entative hou&s;es repeatedly, for oppo&s;ing with manly firmne&s;s his inva&s;ions on the rights of the people.</P>
<P>He has refu&s;ed, for a long time after &s;uch di&s;&s;olutions, to cau&s;e others to be elected; whereby the legi&s;lative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exerci&s;e; the &s;tate remaining in the mean time expo&s;ed to all the danger of inva&s;ion from without, and convul&s;ions within.</P>
<P>He has endeavoured to prevent the population of the&s;e &s;tates; for that purpo&s;e ob&s;tructing the laws for naturalization of fo|reigners; refu&s;ing to pa&s;s others to encourage their migra|tions
<PB N="189" REF="017390_0189_0FA1118B49746130">
hither, and rai&s;ing the conditions of new appropriati|ons of lands.</P>
<P>He has ob&s;tructed the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, by refu&s;|ing his a&s;&s;ent to laws for e&s;tabli&s;hing judiciary powers.</P>
<P>He has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their &s;alaries.</P>
<P>He has erected a multitude of new offices, and &s;ent hi|ther &s;warms of officers to harra&s;s our people, and eat out their &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>He has kept among us in times of peace, &s;tanding armies, without the con&s;ent of our legi&s;latures.</P>
<P>He has affected to render the military independent of and &s;uperior to the civil power.</P>
<P>He has combined with others to &s;ubject us to a juri&s;dicti|on foreign to our con&s;titution, and un-acknowledged by our laws; giving his a&s;&s;ent to their acts of pretended legi&s;lation.</P>
<P>For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:</P>
<P>For protecting them, by a mock trial, from puni&s;hment for any murders which they &s;hould commit on the inhabi|tants of the&s;e &s;tates:</P>
<P>For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:</P>
<P>For impo&s;ing taxes on us without our con&s;ent:</P>
<P>For depriving us, in many ca&s;es, of the benefits of trial by jury:</P>
<P>For tran&s;porting us beyond &s;eas to be tried for pretended offences:</P>
<P>For aboli&s;hing the free &s;y&s;tem of Engli&s;h laws in a neigh|bouring province, e&s;tabli&s;hing therein an arbitrary govern|ment, and enlarging its boundaries, &s;o as to render it at once an example and fit in&s;trument for introducing the &s;ame ab|&s;olute rule into the&s;e colonies:</P>
<P>For taking away our charters, aboli&s;hing our mo&s;t valu|able laws, and altering fundamentally the forms of our go|vernments:</P>
<P>For &s;u&s;pending our own legi&s;latures, and declaring them|&s;elves inve&s;ted with power to legi&s;late for us in all ca&s;es what&s;oever.</P>
<P>He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection, and waging war again&s;t us.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="017390_0190_0FA1118C13702E58">He has plundered our &s;eas, ravaged our coa&s;ts, burnt our towns, and de&s;troyed the lives of our people.</P>
<P>He is, at this time, tran&s;porting large armies of foreign mercenaries to compleat the works of death, de&s;olation and tyranny, already begun with circum&s;tances of cruelty and perfidy, &s;carcely paralleled in the mo&s;t barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.</P>
<P>He has con&s;trained our fellow citizens, taken captive on the high &s;eas, to bear arms again&s;t their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall them|&s;elves by their hands.</P>
<P>He has excited dome&s;tic in&s;urrections among&s;t us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the mercile&s;s indian &s;avages, who&s;e known rule of warfare is an undi&s;tingui&s;hed de&s;truction of all ages, &s;exes and con|ditions.</P>
<P>In every &s;tage of the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions we have petitioned for redre&s;s in the mo&s;t humble terms: our repeated petitions have been an&s;wered only by repeated injury. A prince, who&s;e character is thus marked by every act which may de|fine a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</P>
<P>Nor have we been wanting in attention to our Briti&s;h brethren. We have warned them from time to time of at|tempts made by their legi&s;lature to extend an unwarrantable juri&s;diction over us. We hare reminded them of the cir|&s;tances of our emigration and &s;ettlement here. We have appealed to their native ju&s;tice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them, by the ties of our common kindred, to di&s;avow the&s;e u&s;urpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and corre&s;pondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of ju&s;tice and of con&s;anguinity. We mu&s;t, therefore, acquie&s;ce in the nece&s;&s;ity, which denounces our &s;eparation, and hold them, as we hold the re&s;t of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends.</P>
<P>We, therefore, the Repre&s;entatives of the United States of America, in General Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the authority of the good people of the&s;e colonies, &s;olemnly publi&s;h and decl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e,

<P><HI>Art.</HI> 3. The two contracting parties &s;hall, each on its own part, and in the manner it may judge mo&s;t proper, make all the efforts in it's power again&s;t their common enemy, in order to attain the end propo&s;ed.</P>
